Foreword
For the last decade, Xavier and David have authored several books and articles on SAP 
BusinessObjects products, including Design Studio and Dashboards. I have personally known 
Xavier for many years, and his approach to Business Intelligence, with practical advice and 
real, step-by-step development support, has been invaluable for thousands of developers 
and business people struggling to keep up with this rapidly changing technology.
Currently, there is no other guide that is more comprehensive than the cookbook you are 
now holding. It covers all the new capabilities within SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 4.1. 
I particularly like the way Xavier and David continue to write using recipes. This approach 
quickly allows you to find the functionality you need, and then get the step-by-step advice on 
how to do it. This is very unlike some other books on the market that only tell you what to do, 
but really do not show you how to do it.
In this updated and expanded edition, you will appreciate the new chapters on performance 
tuning and how to get maximum developer performance through shortcuts, tips, and tricks. 
You will also find an updated section on dashboards based on mobile and HTML and an 
introduction to Design Studio.
In addition to these new sections, you will still find in-depth information on all aspects 
of Dashboards 4.1, including spreadsheet customization options, the manipulation of 
worksheets and canvas components, and data visualization, including the numerous charts 
and associated components that can be implemented as extensions. By following the advice 
in this book, your dashboards can cease to be static presentations of data and take on a new 
form of interactivity, where you can save scenarios and interact with the data in ways not 
done before.
In this book, you will also find recommendations on key concepts that are taught in classes 
but are seldom used by beginner developers, including how to hide graphs and call them 
through dynamic visibility and how to tailor the look and feel of a dashboard using templates 
and standards.

You will also appreciate that all of the dashboard connectivity options are explained, including 
connections to Excel XML Maps, SAP HANA, Live Office, Query as a Web Service, SAP BW, 
ODBC, and others. David and Xavier also cover how to integrate third-party add-ons such 
as Google Maps and Salesforce.com. Any developer, whether a senior or beginner, will 
significantly benefit from this latest cookbook. Frankly, all my developers use the previous 
cookbook as a reference when they are stuck on certain tasks, and I, personally, have been 
using the cookbook in my lectures at the SAP University Alliance over the last few years. 
It is with great anticipation that we can now welcome another updated version into our 
development labs, training classes, and forums. I hope you will enjoy this book as much 
as I have.

Acknowledgments
Writing this book has been a long journey, and it would not have been possible without the 
guidance, inspiration, and mentorship provided by many others along the way. I'd like to show 
appreciation to all those who have assisted me along the path.
First of all, I would like to thank the Xcelsius developers for their efforts in bringing us new 
features and fixes with every new version of Xcelsius.
I would like to thank everyone in the Xcelsius community for their contributions on SDN, 
LinkedIn, and blogs. Without the community, we wouldn't have anywhere to look for help when 
we come across a problem. In addition, thoughts and ideas are taken into account by the 
development team to create a better product in the long run. A big thank you goes to Kalyan 
Verma for giving me the opportunity to contribute to his blog, http://myxcelsius.com, 
and really getting me kick-started with community participation (an excellent job on getting 
myxcelsius.com to where it is today!). Another big thanks to Mico Yuk of Everything Xcelsius 
for her past advice and really getting the community involved with Xcelsius.
I'd like to thank Xavier Hacking for coauthoring the book. Without Xavier's teamwork, 
knowledge, and expertise, this book would not have been a success. I would also like 
to commend his great work on his blog at http://www.hackingsap.com.
A big thanks to the Packt Publishing team (Stephanie Moss, Leena Purkait, Reshma 
Sundaresan, and Samantha Gonsalves) for providing all the necessary guidance in our

Preface
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 4.1 (formerly known as Xcelsius) is a desktop dashboard 
and visualization solution that is a core part of SAP BusinessObjects BI 4.1. Once a 
user creates a dashboard model, it can be deployed in Flash format to web portals, SAP 
environments, the SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform, and desktop applications such as 
PowerPoint, Word, or PDF.
For dashboard designers/developers, SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards allows for rapid 
development of data visualizations through a flexible and easy-to-use graphical user interface.
Using SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards, we can accomplish the following:
f
f
Create interactive dashboards that have a wow factor unlike other dashboard 
tool competitors.
f
f
Connect dashboards to over 10 different types of data connections.
f
f
Integration and interoperability with existing SAP BusinessObjects BI content.
f
f
We can embed our dashboards into a variety of different formats to allow for 
convenient sharing between users.
f
f
Ability to create custom add-on components using the SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards SDK.
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards in its original conception was a way to build visualizations 
and dashboards using Excel data. That is also where the original name Xcelsius comes 
from. Over the past decade, BusinessObjects has enhanced Xcelsius into a fully featured 
enterprise-ready dashboard solution that works with any data source.
After the acquisition of BusinessObjects by SAP, the mission to make Xcelsius a dashboard 
product to serve all its customers (beyond being just a personal productivity tool) continued. 
The BI market and SAP customers were also demanding an enterprise dashboard solution 
for the types of projects they were using Xcelsius for, for example, dashboards for thousands 
of users using large data warehouses as a datasource. The name Xcelsius was no longer 
meaningful or relevant.

Preface
vi
By changing the name Xcelsius to SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards, SAP is showing its 
commitment to delivering a solution that serves the needs of all BI customers as well as 
aligning the name to the product's growing capabilities and roadmap.
The SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards portfolio consists of several different packages (see 
the edition comparison later in the preface). In this book, we use SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards to refer to the tool itself.
What this book covers
Chapter 1, Staying in Control, presents you with best practices for using the SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards spreadsheet, the data model, and connections with 
the components on the canvas.
Chapter 2, Data Visualization, presents you with recipes on how to use different components 
such as charts, tables, and graphs to visualize data on the dashboard.
Chapter 3, From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard, shows you how to add interactivity 
to your dashboards by adding selectors, maps, buttons, drilldowns, and so on.
Chapter 4, Dynamic Visibility, shows you how to make components visible/invisible and 
provides scenarios where dynamic visibility becomes useful.
Chapter 5, Using Alerts, contains examples of different ways of showing alerts on a 
dashboard.
Chapter 6, Advanced Components, provides recipes on SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards' 
more advanced components.
Chapter 7, Dashboard Look and Feel, teaches you how to tweak the visuals and user 
experience of the dashboard by customizing the look of components.
Chapter 8, Dashboard Data Connectivity, talks about the various options to connect a 
dashboard to external data sources.
Chapter 9, Exporting and Publishing, contains recipes on how to export SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards into different environments.
Chapter 10, Top Third-party Add-ons, contains an introduction to some of the most useful 
third-party add-ons for SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards.
Chapter 11, Performance Tuning, teaches you how to improve the performance of your 
dashboards by tweaking the spreadsheet and optimizing the data sources' connection setup.
Chapter 12, Increasing Productivity, discusses various development best practices and tips 
to save precious development time.

Preface
vii
Appendix A, Real-world Dashboard Case Studies, demonstrates how to implement various 
techniques covered in this book by creating two applications: a calculator that displays 
monthly payments of a mortgage and a sales/profit dashboard that displays the sales or 
profit of each state on a map.
Appendix B, Additional Resources – Supported Excel Functions and System/Software 
Requirements, lists some helpful online resources for further reference and some useful 
Microsoft Excel functions supported by SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards.
Appendix C, The Future of Dashboarding with SAP Design Studio, introduces you to a new SAP 
tool: Design Studio. A comparison with SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards is made and the 
future roadmap for this tool is shared.

Who this book is for
If you are a developer with a good command and knowledge of creating dashboards, but are 
not yet an advanced SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards user, then this is the perfect book 
for you. You should have a good working knowledge of Microsoft Excel, as well as knowledge 
of basic dashboard practices, though experience of SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards as a 
specific dashboard tool is not essential.
This book provides an interactive hands-on approach to SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 
education by allowing you to work with components, learn best practices, and practice 
troubleshooting techniques.
Conventions
In this book, you will find a number of styles of text that distinguish between different kinds of 
information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an explanation of their meaning.
Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, 
dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "You must be able to view 
hidden files and folders in the C:\Documents and Settings\your_user_id folder."
A block of code is set as follows:
final String BO_CMS_NAME = "server";
final String BO_AUTH_TYPE = "secEnterprise";
When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or 
items are set in bold:
final String BO_CMS_NAME = "server";
final String BO_AUTH_TYPE = "secEnterprise";
New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, in 
menus or dialog boxes for example, appear in the text like this: "Double-click the group or 
right-click and select Rename from the context menu."
Warnings or important notes appear in a box like this.
Tips and tricks appear like this.

Introduction
During the development of a typical SAP BusinessObjects dashboard, the number of 
components as well as the Excel spreadsheet data bindings can become quite complex. To 
prevent us from getting lost in an unmanageable chaos of components, interactions, bindings, 
and several different Excel functionalities, a structured approach should be followed right 
from the start of dashboard development. Also, we should use the advantages Excel gives us 
to build an optimal data model that is easy to read and maintain.

Understanding the dashboard workspace
Before you begin designing dashboards, it is important that you understand the workspace. 
The workspace area is illustrated as follows:
Let's have a look at some of the important sections of the dashboard workspace as depicted 
in the preceding screenshot:
f
f
Menu bar and toolbar (1): SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards consists of a menu bar 
as well as five toolbars that are used to help develop dashboards.
f
f
Dashboard canvas (2): This is where the dashboard presentation is built. Users drag 
and drop dashboard objects here.
f
f
Embedded spreadsheet (3): This embedded spreadsheet is used to associate the 
dashboard objects with data. More information on tips and best practices when 
building your spreadsheet models can be found later in this chapter.
f
f
The Components window (4): Users can drag and drop dashboard components from 
the Components window onto the dashboard canvas.
f
f
The Object Browser (5): All objects existing in the dashboard model can be found in 
the Object Browser. It provides a way to easily access your dashboard objects. For 
more instructions on using the object browser, please refer to the following recipe, 
Using the Object Browser.
f
f
The Properties window (6): This contains settings and formatting options for a 
selected component.

f
f
The Query Browser (7): This allows users to create and manage dashboard queries. 
For more information, please refer to the recipe Using the Query Browser in Chapter 
8, Dashboard Data Connectivity.
f
f
The Mobile Compatibility window (8): This provides mobile compatibility information 
on all the objects found in the dashboard model. For more information, please refer 
to the recipe Going mobile in Chapter 9, Exporting and Publishing.
Using the Object Browser
The Object Browser has a number of features which come in very handy during the 
development of a complex dashboard. In this section, we will discuss hiding, locking, 
and ordering of components.
Getting ready
Drag several components to the canvas.
How to do it...
1.	 Go to the Object Browser.
2.	 Click on the dot in the first of the two columns on the right side of the Object Browser 
for the component that you want to hide. The dot turns into a checkmark. As you can 
see, the component now disappears from the canvas.
3.	 Now click on the dot on the right for any of the components.
4.	 Try to move the component or make any other change to it.
5.	 As you'll see, the component is completely locked and doesn't change.
6.	 Make sure some of your components are on top of each other in the canvas. We now 
want to use the Object Browser to rearrange these overlapping components.
7.	
Select the component in the Object Browser that is on top of the list.
8.	 Click the arrow down button in the Object Browser multiple times until the 
component is on top of all the other components.
9.	 As you can see, the component shifts all the way to the top.

How it works...
As we have seen in this recipe, we can hide components and/or groups of components, which 
will make your life easier if you are using a lot of overlapping components. By checking Hide 
for some components, you won't be bothered by these and you can work with the others that 
are unhidden.
There is one thing you should keep in mind. If you hide a component that is 
part of a group but the group itself is unhidden, the complete group will still 
be movable and its properties will be changeable.
Also, we saw that we can lock one or more components or groups of components. Doing this 
makes it impossible to select these components, so it won't be possible to move, change, 
or do anything else with them. In this way you can be sure you won't accidentally alter these 
components.
Hiding and/or locking a component from the Object Browser only hides and/
or locks that component during the development of a dashboard. When you 
preview or execute the dashboard, the component will appear again and 
function normally.
Finally, we changed the order of components on the canvas. This is an important feature when 
we are using overlaying components in our dashboard.
To move a component on top of all other components, you can also right-click on it and select 
the Bring To Front option. Send To Back will move the component all the way down. The 
options Bring Forward and Send Back do the same as the arrows in the Object Browser: 
they move the component one step up or down at a time.
Searching for components
The ability to do a search for components from the Object Browser is a helpful feature 
new to SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 4.1. You can perform a search by either name or 
component type. This comes in handy when you have a lot of objects on the dashboard that 
are inside groups or canvas containers.
Getting ready
Make sure you have a dashboard that contains a set of components.

Chapter 1
5
How to do it…
1.	 Open up the Object Browser window.
2.	 In the top-left input box, type in the object name or component type that you are 
searching for. You will see that your search will filter the objects accordingly.
How it works…
As you can see, the search functionality is a useful feature as you can easily find objects by 
their name.
The search functionality works best when you have named all 
your objects properly.
Grouping the canvas components
Canvas components can be grouped with one or more other components.
Getting ready
Drag several components to the canvas.

purchased from your account at http://www.packtpub.com. If you 
purchased this book elsewhere, you can visit http://www.packtpub.

How to do it...
1.	 Select the components that you want to group. You can do this by either selecting 
multiple components from the dashboard canvas by dragging the mouse over them, 
or clicking the components one-by-one while holding the Ctrl button on your keyboard.
2.	 Right-click anywhere on the canvas and select Group from the context menu. You 
can also use the shortcut Ctrl + G to group these components. As you can see, the 
components are now a group with a common border.

Chapter 1
7
If you double-click on the grouped object you will see a Common tab where you can 
set the Dynamic Visibility and Entry Effect.
3.	 If you create a lot of groups of components, we advise that you name these groups to 
prevent you from getting lost and confused during the dashboard development. First 
go to the Object Browser.
4.	 Select the group you want to rename.
5.	 Double-click the group or right-click and select Rename from the context menu.
6.	 Type in the new name for this group.

Staying in Control
8
How it works...
When your dashboard gets more complex, not only will the data model in the spreadsheet 
grow, the number of components used on the canvas will also increase. Using groups to 
differentiate the canvas components from each other is a great way to stay in control of 
your dashboard.
Name the groups as something that can be visually matched to your 
dashboard, such as a section heading. In that way, someone who did not 
originally develop the dashboard can quickly see which set of components 
the object group refers to.
Making the spreadsheet more readable 
with colors
The more complex a dashboard gets, the more clogged the spreadsheet might get with data, 
Excel formulas, and other usages. To make clear what the exact purpose of a cell is, we color 
code them to make things more clear.
Getting ready
You need a basic SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file containing a few components in the 
canvas with some bindings to the data model in the spreadsheet.
How to do it...
1.	 Go to your data model in the spreadsheet.
2.	 Select the cell(s) you want to color.
3.	 Click on the Fill Color button in the Font section of the Home tab and select the 
desired color.

Chapter 1
9
4.	 Color the cells that have dynamic visibility values in orange.
5.	 Color the cells with input values from canvas components in yellow. In the following 
screenshot, row A3:N3 is used as the destination range for a drill down from a chart.
6.	 Color the cells that will be filled with data from an external data source in blue.
7.	
Color the cells with Excel formulas in green.
How it works...
As you can see, there are many roles that cells in the spreadsheet can play. If these were 
not color coded, you would be faced with a daunting task when updating the Excel model in 
the future. In our example, we colored calculations in green, external data input in blue, and 
component input data in yellow.

Staying in Control
10
There's more...
To make the data model readable, not only for yourself but also for others, it is helpful to 
create a legend in your spreadsheet that explains what each color represents. Any color 
scheme can be used, but it is important that you stick to the chosen scheme and use it 
consistently throughout the development of your dashboard.
It is important to create a separate worksheet that houses the legend, as seen in the following 
screenshot. You can also use this overall summary worksheet to include the information such 
as project name, description, usage, version (history), and so on.
Making the spreadsheet more readable 
with comments
Sometimes, cells need additional information to explain how they are used. You can create 
comment text on an adjacent cell. Or, if you do not want to fill up other cells, you can right-click 
on the same cell and select Insert Comment.
Getting ready
You need a basic dashboard containing a few components in the canvas with some bindings 
to the data model in the spreadsheet. You can also just reuse the dashboard from the 
previous recipe.
How to do it...
1.	 Right-click on the cell to which you want to add the extra information.
2.	 Choose Insert Comment.

Chapter 1
11
3.	 Add your text. A small red triangle will appear in the upper-right corner of the cell.
4.	 Now hover your mouse over the cell and the comment you just entered will appear.
How it works...
Comments are related to one spreadsheet cell only and are shown if you hover over the cell. 
This is a great way to document information that you do not need to see all the time, and 
keeps your data model clean.

Staying in Control
12
A little remark about the usage of comments: they increase the size of the SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards file a bit.
If you want the comment to always show up without hovering over the cell, you 
can right-click on the comment and then select Show/Hide Comments.
Making the spreadsheet more readable 
with borders
To separate cells from each other and create different areas within a spreadsheet, you can 
use cell borders.
Getting ready
You can use the same basic dashboard as in the previous examples.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the cell(s) you want to add a border to and right-click on it.
2.	 Now select Format cells....

Chapter 1
13
3.	 Go to the Border tab.
4.	 Select the desired style of the border line.
5.	 Select on which side(s) of the cell(s) the border should appear.
6.	 Click on OK.
There's more...
We will now discuss three more topics regarding spreadsheet borders: using the toolbar 
border button, using multiple worksheets, and placing Excel logic within the spreadsheet.

Staying in Control
14
Using the toolbar border button
Instead of right-clicking on the cells and using the Format Cells option, you can also use the 
Border button on the toolbar to adjust the border styles for a cell or a group of cells. You can 
find this button in the Font section of the Home tab. If you select the cell(s) and click on this 
button, a list of options will be shown, which you can choose from.
Using multiple worksheets
You can use borders to split data within a spreadsheet. But if your dashboard contains data 
from a lot of different (functional) areas, it is recommended that you split your spreadsheet 
into several worksheets. This will help you to keep your dashboard maintainable.
A good strategy to split up the spreadsheet is to divide your data in different areas that 
correspond to certain layers or tabs that you created on the dashboard canvas. You can 
also use separate sheets for each external data connection. Give each worksheet a 
meaningful name.

Chapter 1
15
Placing your Excel logic wisely
Another general guideline is to place as many cells with Excel logic and SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards interactivity functionality at the top left of the spreadsheet. This place is easy to 
reach without a lot of annoying scrolling and searching. Even more importantly, your dataset 
may grow (vertically and/or horizontally) over time. This can be a risk especially when you 
are using an external data connection and you don't want your logic to be overwritten. For 
example, if you use a column summation, place it at the top of the column instead of the 
bottom. This way, if you need to add another value to the list of cells to be summed, you can 
add it to the bottom without having to shift down the formula cell.
Using named ranges
With named ranges, it is possible to define a worksheet cell or a range of cells with 
a logical name.
Getting ready
You can use one of the dashboards from the previous recipes, or just create a new 
blank dashboard.
How to do it...
1.	 Select a range of cells (for example, B1:B12).
2.	 Insert a description (for example, Total_Sales) for this range in the Name Box in 
the upper left-hand side of the worksheet.

Staying in Control
16
3.	 Now, this named range can be used in formulas in other worksheet cells. Type the 
formula =SUM(Total_Sales) in cell B13.
How it works...
Using named ranges makes your formulas more readable, especially when you are working 
with multiple worksheets and using formulas that refer to cells in other worksheets.
There is a restriction to using named ranges in SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards: the defined named range must refer to a single cell or must 
use formulas that return a single value from a range of cells. For example, 
let's say we have two named ranges: Sales (A1:A12) and Cost (B1:B12). A 
supported formula would be =SUM(Sales)-SUM(Cost). An unsupported 
formula would be =Sales-Cost.
There's more...
In this section, we will discuss two ways to select and manage your named ranges.

Chapter 1
17
Defined named ranges
Clicking on the little triangle in the Name Box will show a list of all your defined named ranges 
in all your worksheets.
The Name Manager
If you use a lot of named ranges, the Name Manager can be a helpful tool to manage your 
named ranges. Here, you can also edit and delete the existing named ranges. You can find 
the Name Manager under the Defined Names section of the Formulas tab or by using the 
shortcut Ctrl + F3.

Staying in Control
18
Copying the format of one cell to another 
cell or range
This recipe shows you how to copy the formatting of one cell to another cell or range. For 
example, we can copy a yellow background and Calibri font from cell A1 to cell A2.
How to do it...
1.	 Click on the source cell that you want to copy the formatting from.
2.	 Click on the Format Painter icon, which you can find in the Clipboard section of the 
Home tab.
3.	 Click on the cell or range that you want to copy the source cell's formatting to.

Chapter 1
19
How it works...
For SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards developers, it happens very often when they have 
to copy colored cells that represent different types of logic such as dynamic visibility cells, 
insertion cells, and so on.
The Format Painter tool works by taking the source cell that you have selected and applying 
the formatting to the cell(s) that you paint to. This is very useful because we can copy cell 
formats without having to perform a Copy and Paste Special action every time.
There's more...
An alternative to accomplishing the same task is to copy a cell and then click Paste Special... 
and choose the Formats option from Paste.
Debugging the spreadsheets
It is common that SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards developers may accidently put in the 
incorrect formula when developing logic on their spreadsheets. Using the Ctrl + ` hotkey will 
make things much easier.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the worksheet you want to see formulas for.
2.	 Hit the Ctrl + ` (grave accent) hotkey.
3.	 You will see the value in the cell change to the formula.
How it works...
The Ctrl + ` hotkey works by showing the underlying formula of a cell. This is extremely useful 
if you are comparing formulas from multiple cells, as the developer does not have to flip 
between formulas in order to see what they are doing wrong when comparing multiple cells. 
Developers can quickly analyze their worksheet and find the cause of their problem.

Staying in Control

The following screenshot shows the results of two Excel formulas in cells A1 and A2:
After using the Ctrl + ` hotkey, the formulas of both cells are displayed, as you can see in the 
next screenshot:

Chapter 1
21
There's more...
An alternative way to accomplish the same task is to go to the Formula Auditing section of 
the Formulas tab and then click on Show Formulas. Refer to the following screenshot:
Navigating between worksheets
When developing dashboards it is a common problem to have to manually scroll through 
tabs when there are too many worksheets. To access tabs that are not visible, we are used 
to pressing the arrow keys to move to the desired tab.

Staying in Control
22
How to do it...
1.	 To have all tabs displayed in one menu, right-click on any of the arrow keys at the 
bottom, in the left-hand side navigation area. You will then see the list of tabs that 
you can choose from.
2.	 You can also use Ctrl + PageUp, which will move to the previous sheet in 
your workbook.
3.	 Ctrl + PageDown will navigate to the next sheet in the workbook.
How it works...
This tip allows developers to quickly toggle between worksheets. Being able to quickly 
right-click and view a menu of all available tabs is faster than scrolling through each tab in 
order to reach tabs that are not visible. In addition, the ability to use a hotkey to cycle through 
each tab brings some time-saving benefits to those who are comfortable with using the 
keyboard to perform all their actions.

Introduction
Data visualization may be the most important topic when we are talking about dashboard 
creation. It enables us to view data, compare values, and make analyses in a clear and 
effective way. A dashboard is the ideal platform to present these visualizations.
Data can be presented in a graphical way; for example, with lines, bars, colored areas, 
gauges, or just with a simple red/green indicator. But on the other hand, in some cases, 
it may be more effective to use a simple list of values instead of these graphs. This totally 
depends on the purpose of the dashboard.
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards provides a great toolkit with lots of visualization 
components. This chapter will discuss these components and show you how to use them.
Adding a line chart to your dashboard
A line chart is very useful to visualize data that changes over time. It consists of a set of data 
points that are connected by a line. The horizontal x-axis typically shows the categories in 
which the data is divided. The vertical y-axis shows us the values.
This recipe shows how to add a line chart to a dashboard and how to link it to the data in 
the spreadsheet. We will also discuss the components that are similar to the line chart 
component: bar chart, column chart, area chart, stacked chart, and the Marimekko chart.
Getting ready
Open a new file in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards and enter the data into the spreadsheet, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
You can also click on the Line Chart component in the Components browser, 
move your cursor to the canvas area (the arrow will now change into a cross), 
and click again. You can use whatever method you prefer.

Chapter 2
25
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Line Chart component from the Components browser into the canvas:
2.	 Select the Line Chart component you just added to the canvas by clicking on it. Now, 
the component is surrounded by eight blocks that enable you to adjust the size of 
the component.

Data Visualization
26
3.	 The properties pane for this component is also visible now. By default, the General 
tab is selected. In the Data section we can bind the data we entered earlier in the 
spreadsheet to this component. Click on the button on the right-hand side of the By 
Range field:
If the properties pane isn't present on your screen, you can 
activate it from the menu under View | Properties. You can 
also right-click the component and select Properties.
4.	 In the spreadsheet, select the range from A4 to E7 and click on OK. The data is now 
bound to the component:
5.	 The Data section of the properties pane now looks like what is shown in the following 
screenshot. The chart will show the data series we just bound.

Chapter 2
27
6.	 In the same way, we can add titles to this chart. Select spreadsheet cell A1 and enter 
Sales data; also, enter 2011 in cell A2.
7.	
Bind the Chart field in the properties pane with spreadsheet cell A1 and bind the 
Subtitle field with cell A2.
You can also enter a value in these title fields directly.
8.	 In the Category (Y) Axis field, enter Tonne.
9.	 Your setup should now look like what is shown in the following screenshot. Click on 
the Preview button to try the dashboard.

Data Visualization
28
How it works...
The preceding section showed how to connect data in one or more spreadsheet cells to 
the Line Chart component through several options in its properties pane. This is how we 
bind data and you will be using this a lot during the development of dashboards with SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards.
There's more...
In this section we will discuss manually binding data to charts and how to hide and show data 
series in a chart. We will also go through some other chart components that work in a similar 
way to the Line Chart component.
Manually binding data
In this recipe, we used a pretty straightforward dataset with the category labels in the first row 
(Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4) and the series names in the first column (Apple, Banana, and Cherry). 
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards is able to understand this dataset and bind this information 
automatically. However, this may not always be the case, and therefore, not always lead to the 
visualization you had in mind.
To change the direction of the visualization of the spreadsheet data in the chart, you can 
select the Data in Columns option in the Data section of the properties pane. This will switch 
the series and the labels.
By clicking on By Series in the Data section of the properties pane, it is possible to manually 
adjust all binding settings for the name and values of each series. Additionally, you can select 
the axis a series should be plotted on (primary or secondary). You can change the series order 
by using the two arrow buttons and add or remove series by using the + and - buttons. Also, you 
can manually bind the category labels to a range of cells shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 2
29
Hide/show series
Series in a chart can be hidden or shown by the user when using the dashboard by following 
these steps:
1.	 Go to the Appearance tab and select the sub-tab Layout.
2.	 Make sure that Enable Legend is selected.
3.	 Select Enable Hide/Show Chart Series at Run-Time.
4.	 Set Interaction to Check Box.
5.	 Click on the Preview button to try this feature.
Other charts
In the following sections, several other chart types will be introduced. These charts work 
roughly in the same way as the line chart component.
Bar chart and column chart
The bar chart and column chart components can be configured in exactly the same way as 
a Line Chart component. A bar chart presents values in horizontal bars while the column 
chart uses vertical bars. These types of charts are typically not used to present data over a 
long time period, but to show data from different categories that need to be compared. The 
following screenshot shows the bar chart and column chart representation:

Data Visualization
30
Area chart
The area chart component is a line chart with a filled area beneath the line. Another 
difference between these two types of charts is that in an area chart, the first value (Q1) is 
plotted on the far left-hand side and the last value (Q4) on the far right-hand side of the chart. 
An area chart is used to visualize the cumulated total value of the series over a period of time. 
This component can be configured in the same way as the line chart component. The following 
screenshot displays an area chart:
Stacked charts
The bar chart, column chart, and area chart components all have a stacked versions: stacked 
bar chart, stacked column chart, and stacked area chart. These stacked chart components 
show the values of the series on top of each other in the same column. You can use stacked 
charts if the dashboard user wants to compare totals, as shown in the following screenshot:
Marimekko chart
The Marimekko chart is a special type of stacked chart. Instead of displaying absolute values, 
the bars now have the same height and the segments of each bar represent a percentage 
of the total. The same principle counts for the width of each bar. The following screenshot 
displays a Marimekko chart:

Chapter 2
31
The setup of the Marimekko chart component is similar to the other stacked chart components, 
with only one addition. In the Data section of the General tab of the properties pane, we will 
now find the option to bind category values, which will determine the width of the bars as seen 
in the following screenshot:
Using a bullet chart
A bullet chart is in fact a bar or column chart with a lot of extra options. It can serve as a 
replacement for gauges and meters. Besides visualizing a data point as bar and column 
charts do, a bullet chart is able to show a target and two or more qualitative ranges. These 
ranges can indicate whether a value can be considered bad, satisfactory, good, and so on.
This recipe will show you how to configure a bullet chart. SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 
has two bullet chart components: horizontal and vertical. Both components have exactly the 
same configuration options and work in the same manner. This recipe will use the horizontal 
bullet chart.

Data Visualization
32
Getting ready
Open a new file in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards and enter the data into the spreadsheet, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Horizontal Bullet Chart component into the canvas.
2.	 Bind the By Range field to the spreadsheet range from A4 to E7:
3.	 Also bind the Chart field in the Titles section to spreadsheet cell A1 and bind the 
Subtitle field to cell A2.

Chapter 2
33
4.	 Hit the Preview button and hover on the different sections of the bars. The 
dashboard now shows the detailed information we just bound:
How it works...
The bullet chart components can show a result value, a target, and qualitative ranges. 
Furthermore, each series can have its own label and sub-label. Let's have a look at exactly 
how these variables are configured in the preceding How to do it... section.
First, select By Series in the Data section of the properties pane for the Horizontal Bullet 
Chart component; then, select the Apple series. You can now see the detailed bindings SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards made for this series as shown in the following screenshot:

The Label field is bound to spreadsheet cell A5 (Apple). We did not edit the Sub-Label field 
so this remains empty, but you can bind it to a cell with a certain value or enter a value in this 
field directly. The result value, cell B5 (2200), is bound to the Performance Value field, which 
is represented in the chart by a small horizontal bar. Next, the target value of cell C5 (2000) 
is bound to the Comparative Value field. This value is visualized by a vertical dash. There are 
two cells that are bound as Scale Values: D5 (1800) and E5 (2400). Using two values means 
that the chart will show three areas: 0-1800, 1800-2400, and 2400-max. You can use as 
many values as you need. These areas are shown in the chart as three colored blocks in the 
background. If you don't use scale values, there won't be a colored block in the chart. Take a 
look at the following screenshot:

The bullet chart in the recipe uses the same x-axis for all three series. It is also possible to 
configure separate x axes as done in the following steps:
1.	 Select the Bullet Chart component and go to the Behavior tab. Select the 
Scale sub-tab.
2.	 Select Configure scale by series. Now you can edit the scaling settings for each 
series separately.

Using sparklines
Sparklines are typically small graphics, showing a horizontal line connecting several data 
points without labeling the values on their axes. The purpose of a sparkline is to show the 
movement of a trend over a certain period. Since its details are not available, the context of 
a sparkline must be clear to the dashboard user to interpret its meaning properly. This recipe 
will show you how to configure a sparkline.
Getting ready
Open a new file in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards and enter the data into the spreadsheet, 
as shown in the following screenshot:

How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Sparkline Chart component into the canvas.
2.	 Bind the By Range field to the spreadsheet range from A4 to M5.
3.	 Bind the Chart field to cell A1 and bind the Subtitle field to cell A2.
4.	 Go to the Behavior tab of the properties pane of the Sparkline Chart component. In 
the Normal Range Area section, select Normal Range Area.

38
How it works...
The configuration of the General tab within the properties pane of a sparkline chart 
component looks like the configuration of a line chart component. But, a sparkline chart 
component has fewer options here: no axis and no category labels can be defined. From a 
dashboard user's perspective, this also means that the user has to know and understand 
the context of the presented data. When multiple sparklines are displayed and they all have 
different bands without axes, it is very difficult to compare the values. The user needs to be 
aware of this.
With the Normal Range Area section in the Behavior tab, it is possible to illustrate the range 
of the values of this series. Also, the start and end and the highest and lowest values of the 
presented series can be emphasized.
There's more...
In this section, we will discuss some specific labels for the sparkline component: header 
labels and low and high values.
Header labels
Header labels can label two parts of the sparkline chart component: the series name(s) and 
the sparkline(s). To activate these labels follow the given steps:
1.	 Bind the Header Labels field in the General tab to two spreadsheet cells.
2.	 Enter the value of the series name(s) header in the first cell, and the value of the 
sparkline(s) header in the second cell.
3.	 Now go to the Appearance tab and select the Text sub-tab.
4.	 Select Header Labels. The labels will now appear in the component, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 2
39
Low and high values
Besides the start and end values of a sparkline, you can also show the lowest and highest 
values. In the Text sub-tab of the Appearance tab, you can select them to be visible as 
shown in the following screenshot:
Using a combination chart
With the combination chart you can use both columns and lines to visualize data in one 
single chart.
Getting ready
Open a new file in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards and enter the data, as shown in the 
following screenshot, into the spreadsheet:
In the Number section of the Home tab of the toolbar, use the % option to convert the market 
share values into percentages:

How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Combination Chart component to the canvas.
2.	 Bind the Chart field to cell A1 and the Subtitle field to cell B2.
3.	 Bind the By Range field to the spreadsheet range from A4 to E6.
4.	 Select By Series and select the Market share series. Select the option to Plot Series 
On: Secondary Axis:
5.	 As you can see now, both axes are populated with values:

Chapter 2

How it works...
After binding the data to the component, we adjusted the Market share series to plot its data 
on the secondary axis. After doing this, a second y-axis appeared on the right-hand side of the 
chart, labeled with percentages.

In the Series sub-tab within the Appearance tab of the properties pane, you can determine how 
each series will appear: either as a column or a line. Here, you can also set the series colors and 
marker Shape, Marker Size, and Transparency as shown in the following screenshot:
Using a waterfall chart
A waterfall chart is useful to visualize the fluctuation of a value in positive and negative 
values. The first and final values are displayed as full columns (starting at 0). The values in 
between represent the positive and negative fluctuations. A good example is the stock level 
of goods in a warehouse. A waterfall chart can show how it changes over time.
This recipe shows you how to set up such a waterfall chart.

Data Visualization
42
Getting ready
Open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file and enter data in the spreadsheet as 
shown in the following screenshot. As you can see in row 3, the first and final value (January 
and December) show the total stock level, instead of the change relative to the previous 
period, as is shown in the other months:
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Waterfall Chart component into the canvas.
2.	 Bind the Values field to the spreadsheet range from B3 to M3.
3.	 Bind the Labels field to the spreadsheet range from B1 to M1.
How it works...
Instead of showing the total value for each category, the waterfall chart shows how an initial 
value (January) changes over time until it ends in the final value (December). To make this 
work, you have to make sure that the first and final values of your dataset represent the actual 
initial and final value. The other values that are in between should only represent the amount 
of increase or decrease of a value.

Chapter 2
43
There's more...
There are four categories of values in a waterfall chart: initial value, final value, positive value, 
and negative value. These values all have their own color. Initially, the positive values are 
green and the negative ones are red. In the Series sub-tab within the Appearance tab of the 
properties pane, you can change the color of each type of value:
Using a pie chart
A pie chart is circular chart divided into one or more slices. Each slice represents the 
proportion of a value to the total of all values. Pie charts can be used to show the share of a 
value in contrast to other values or the grand total. However, it may be hard to compare the 
size of slices within a pie chart when there are more than three slices, or across other pie 
charts. Therefore, if you need to compare data, we recommend using a bar chart instead.

Data Visualization
44
Getting ready
Open a new file in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards and enter the data, as shown in the 
following screenshot, into the spreadsheet:
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Pie Chart component onto the canvas.
2.	 Bind the Values field to spreadsheet cells B5 through B7.
3.	 Bind the Labels field to cells A5 through A7.
4.	 Bind the Chart field to cell A1 and the Subtitle field to cell B2:

Chapter 2
45
5.	 Preview the dashboard:
How it works...
We bound the fields from the General tab to the data in the spreadsheet, making this chart 
show the three labels and the associated portions of the total in a pie. Obviously, the pie chart 
component cannot use multiple series of data like the line chart and other chart components.
Using a scatter plot chart
A scatter plot chart can display values that consist of two variables. The chart shows a set of 
points, each of which refer to a combination of a value on the x-axis and a value on the y-axis.
In previous versions of SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards (before 4.1) the 
scatter plot chart component was called XY-chart component.
Getting ready
Open a new file in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards and enter the data, as shown in the 
following screenshot, into the spreadsheet:

Data Visualization
46
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Scatter Plot chart component into the canvas.
2.	 Bind the data By Range to spreadsheet cells B5 until C9.
3.	 Bind the Chart field to cell A1 and delete the subtitle.
4.	 Bind the Value (X) Axis field to cell B4 and the Value (Y) Axis field to cell C4. Now it is 
clear what the implication of each axis is.
5.	 Go to the Behavior tab and select the Scale sub-tab. Now select Fixed Label Size.
6.	 Click on the Preview button to try the dashboard.
How it works...
In this example, we created a dashboard that compares the price of a house (variable 1) with 
the number of weeks until it is sold (variable 2). It shows us that cheap houses are sold very 
quickly; houses priced between cheap and expensive (mid-range) take a very long time to sell; 
while expensive houses are somewhat in between.
By using the Fixed Label Size option, the values of the x-axis are shortened for better 
readability. As we saw in the recipe, thousands (100,000) become K (100K). In addition, 
millions turn into M, billions into B, and trillions into T.

Chapter 2
47
Using a bubble plot chart
A bubble plot chart is essentially the same as a scatter plot chart, except that it has a third 
variable that determines the size of each point. The following screenshot represents a bubble 
plot chart:
Getting ready
You can reuse the dashboard from the Using a scatter plot chart recipe and add the values in 
column D, as shown in the following screenshot:
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Bubble Plot Chart component into the canvas.
2.	 Bind the data By Range to spreadsheet cells B5 through D9.
3.	 Bind the Chart field to cell A1 and delete the subtitle.
4.	 Bind the Value (X) Axis field to cell B4 and the Value (Y) Axis field to cell C4.
5.	 Go to the Behavior tab and select the Scale sub-tab. Now select Fixed Label Size.

Data Visualization
48
How it works...
In addition to the analysis we made in the Using a scatter plot chart recipe, we can now 
also see that the number of houses for sale in the mid-range market is very high, while the 
availability in the expensive market is very low.
Using a radar chart
The radar chart is able to represent more than two variables in a single chart. In this 
chart, the multiple axes all start at the same point. The radar chart can be used to make 
comparisons between series based on their score on a set of variables. In this way outliers 
can be quickly discovered and analyzed. The following screenshot represents a radar chart:
Getting ready
Open a new file in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards and enter the data, as shown in the 
following screenshot, into the spreadsheet:

Chapter 2
49
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Radar Chart component to the canvas.
2.	 Enter a name and subtitle for the chart.
3.	 Bind the cell range A4 to F6 to the By Range field.
How it works...
Our dataset has two series and five categories. The chart has an axis for each category, and 
on these axes, the accompanying values are plotted for each series. The values of a series 
are connected with a line.
There's more...
The filled radar chart component does the same job as the radar chart component and has 
the same configuration options. The only difference in the filled radar chart component is 
that the area between the connected value points is filled with a color. As the following figure 
shows, the overlap area stands out as it is darker:
Using an OHLC chart and a candlestick 
chart
The OHLC chart and candlestick chart are both designed to show the movement of a stock 
price over time. OHLC stands for Open, High, Low, and Close. These four stock price values are 
illustrated for each time unit.

Data Visualization

Both components work in exactly the same way, so you can use both the OHLC chart 
component and the candlestick chart component for this recipe. The only difference between 
them is the graphical visualization. The following screenshot displays an OHLC chart:
Getting ready
For this recipe, we need some historical stock data. Open your browser and go to 
http://www.nasdaq.com/ and look for historical quotes on the SAP AG stock as 
shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 2
51
Select a timeframe of one month and copy and paste the quotes to the spreadsheet of a new 
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file, as shown in the following screenshot:
How to do it...
1.	 First, prepare the data in the spreadsheet. It is now sorted from new to old quotes. As 
the OHLC Chart component does not enable sorting (see the recipe, Sorting series, 
later in this chapter) we have to sort the data ourselves in the spreadsheet. Start by 
selecting all the cells you just pasted into the spreadsheet.
2.	 Sort this selection by using the Sort & Filter function in the Editing section of the 
Home tab of the spreadsheet toolbar. Choose the Sort Oldest to Newest option:
3.	 Add an OHLC Chart component to the canvas.
4.	 Enter a chart title and subtitle, or bind these fields to cells in the spreadsheet.
5.	 Bind the data By Range to the range of cells that include all values in the Open, 
High, Low, and Close columns.

6.	 Select By Series and enter SAP in the Series Name field.

In the dataset we copied from the NASDAQ website and pasted to the spreadsheet, 
the dates are in the first column. Bind the Category Labels field to the cells in the 
Date column:
How it works...

The OHLC chart we just created works as follows: the vertical lines show the price 
range (from the highest to the lowest value) of a stock for each day. The little mark on 
the left of these vertical lines indicates the opening price. The little mark on the right 
indicates the closing price. In addition to this, a line with a set of marks has a dark 
color if the closing price is lower than the opening price and a light color if the closing 
price is higher than the opening price as seen in the following screenshot:

Chapter 2
53
f
f
The candlestick chart shows exactly the same data as the OHLC chart. In the 
candlestick chart a rectangle is used to illustrate the opening and closing prices. 
If this rectangle is transparent, the closing price is higher than the opening price, 
and if it's filled the closing price is lower as seen in the following screenshot:
Sorting series
A chart does not always look like what you had in mind. In some cases, you may want to see 
data sorted from high to low values, while in other situations, you want to see the categories 
displayed in a more logical order. For example, in the following bar chart, the quarters are 
sorted from last (Q4) to first (Q1). To change this, you can of course adjust the data model in 
the spreadsheet, like we did in the Using an OHLC chart and a candlestick chart recipe. An 
easier and better way is to use the sorting settings for the bar chart component.
Sorting is available in the following components: line chart, pie chart, column 
chart, stacked column chart, bar chart, stacked bar chart, combination chart, 
area chart, stacked area chart, radar chart, and filled radar chart.
Getting ready
You can reuse any of the dashboards you created earlier, as long as they contain one of the 
previously mentioned components.

Data Visualization
54
How to do it...
1.	 Select the component, go to the Behavior tab, and select the Common sub-tab.
2.	 Select Enable Sorting.
3.	 Select By Category Labels.
4.	 Select Reverse Order.
How it works...
As you can see in the preceding screenshot, the order of the quarters has changed. In SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards, the first category is by default the lowest category on its axis. 
With the reverse order setting, this can be changed.
There's more...
Besides sorting by category labels, it is also possible to sort by data. If you have more than 
one series, you have to choose one of these series to base the sorting order on, as shown in 
the following screenshot:

Chapter 2
55
The following chart shows the data in ascending order:
Zooming in on charts
If you are visualizing a dataset with a large number of values on the x-axis (the category axis), 
the chart might be a bit hard to use. To see a section of such a chart in more detail, we can 
use the range slider to zoom in on the data.
The range slider option is available in the following chart components: line 
chart, OHLC chart, candlestick chart, column chart, bar chart, stacked column 
chart, stacked bar chart, combination chart, area chart, stacked area chart, 
and waterfall chart.
Getting ready
You can reuse any of the dashboards you have already made, which include one of the 
components mentioned previously. In this recipe, we will use the dashboard created 
in the Adding a line chart to your dashboard recipe.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the chart then go to the Behavior tab and select the Common sub-tab.
2.	 Select Enable Range Slider.
3.	 Under Beginning Range Value select Category Label and enter value Q1.
4.	 Under End Range Value also select Category Label and enter value Q3.

Data Visualization
56
5.	 Bind the Range Labels field to cells B4 until E4.
6.	 Go to the Appearance tab and select the Text sub-tab. Select Range Labels and set 
the text size to 8.
7.	
Run the dashboard by hitting the Preview button and try the functionality of the 
range slider.
How it works...
The range slider option makes it possible to select a section of the chart by sliding the 
beginning and end values of this range. In this recipe, we used category labels to define the 
initial range values. You can also choose to use the Position field and enter the position of 
the desired value in its series. Q1 would be position 1 and Q3 would be position 3.

Chapter 2
57
Scaling the y-axis
After binding a chart to a dataset in the spreadsheet, SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 
makes up a scale on the y axis by default, based on the lowest and highest values in the 
visualized dataset. The problem with this auto-scaling is that it creates a y-axis that doesn't 
start with 0, which may cause a bad interpretation of the data.
In the following screenshot, the same results are presented in two bar charts. The chart on 
the left-hand side gives the indication that Product B has performed a lot better than Product 
A; the bar is more than two times larger! This is, of course, wrong, as the y-axis starts at 
$470,000. The chart on the right-hand side shows a version that is much more useful 
for analysis.
Getting ready
You can reuse any of the dashboards you have already made with chart components. In this 
recipe, we will use the dashboard created in the Adding a line chart to your dashboard recipe.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the chart, go to the Behavior tab, and select the Scale sub-tab. If your 
chart has a secondary axis, there will be two sub-tabs: Primary Scale and 
Secondary Scale.
2.	 Select Manual (Y) Axis.
3.	 Enter 0 under Minimum Limit and 1000 under Maximum Limit.
4.	 Select Fixed Label Size.

Data Visualization
58
5.	 Set the Size of Divisions to 200 and Minor Divisions to 1:
How it works...
The y-axis of the chart will now have a fixed minimum and maximum limit. Remember that 
this also means that values higher than 1000 won't be displayed correctly with these settings. 
They will be placed on the maximum value (1000) of this chart.
The Fixed Label Size option keeps the labels on the y-axis readable. 1,000 is 1K, 1,000,000 
is 1M, a billion is 1B, and a trillion is 1T.
There's more...
We conclude this recipe with two additional options regarding scaling the y-axis: variable 
maximum limits and Allow Zoom Out Only.

Chapter 2
59
Variable maximum limits
To make sure that values in the dataset never pass the maximum limit, we can use a variable 
maximum limit by following these steps:
1.	 Go to the spreadsheet and enter this formula in cell D1: =MAX(B5:E7). This will 
result in the maximum value of the range B5 through E7.
2.	 Bind the Maximum Limit to cell D1. The y-axis will now display the exact maximum 
value that resulted from the formula.
3.	 To make this value a more rounded number we have to adjust the formula. Change 
the formula to =ROUNDUP((MAX(B5:E7)),-3). The -3 indicates that the value 
will be rounded up to the nearest thousand. So if the maximum value is 1978, the 
maximum limit on the y-axis will be 2000. -1 rounds to the nearest tens, -2 to the 
nearest hundred, and so on.
Allow Zoom Out Only
If you do want to use an automatic axis, SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards offers the Allow 
Zoom Out Only option. This option is only useful if a dataset that is presented in a chart 
is variable (for example, by switching with a selector; see Chapter 3, From a Static to an 
Interactive Dashboard). By selecting this option, the y-axis will only scale to larger values when 
a dataset with higher values is presented. If the values are lower, the scale will not change. 
With the slider, you can set the sensitivity of the growth factor.
Using a tree map
The tree map, also known as a heat map, visualizes values by dividing an area into a set of 
rectangles. The following screenshot shows an example of a tree map:
As you can see, two variables are used in this chart: one variable expressed by the relative 
size of each rectangle and another one illustrated by the color intensity. Instead of using the 
tree map, you can also choose the scatter plot chart to display two variables in one chart.

Data Visualization
60
Getting ready
For this recipe, we can reuse the file we created in the Using a scatter plot chart recipe.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Tree Map component to the canvas.
2.	 Enter a name for the chart.
3.	 Bind the cell range A4 to C9 to the By Range field.
4.	 Select Data in Columns.
5.	 Select By Series and bind the Name field to cell A1:
6.	 Go to the Appearance tab and select the Series sub-tab.
7.	
Select a very dark color as High Color and a very light color as Low Color:

Chapter 2
61
8.	 Preview the dashboard to check the result:
How it works...
The tree map arranges the rectangles from big to small. The Cat 5 data (most expensive 
houses) is presented on the far left-hand side, while Cat 1 (cheapest houses) is illustrated by 
the block on the lower right-hand side. This rectangle also has the lightest color, indicating the 
lowest Weeks until sale value. In the recipe, we changed the colors to a more extreme range 
so that the differences between the rectangles are clearer.
Showing a trend without a chart
Showing a trend with a line chart is very useful if you want to show data over more than two 
periods. In some cases, all this historical information is unnecessary and you only want to 
display the direction of the trend—up, down, or no change. The trend icon component delivers 
this functionality. This recipe will show you how to use it.
Getting ready
Open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file and enter the data, as shown in the 
following screenshot, into the spreadsheet:
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Trend Icon component into the canvas.
2.	 Enter this formula in spreadsheet cell B3: =B2-B1.

Data Visualization
62
3.	 Now bind the Data field of the Trend Icon component to cell B3. The Trend Icon 
component will now turn red and show a downward arrow:
How it works...
The trend icon component can only be bound to a single cell. If this cell has a positive 
value, the component will be shown in positive state (arrow up). If the value is negative, the 
component will turn into its negative state (arrow down). If the value is zero, a neutral state 
is shown (flat line icon):
We used the formula to calculate whether the change in trend is positive, negative, or neutral.
Displaying raw data
If you want to display numbers and text without a chart, but just in a table, you can use the 
Spreadsheet Table component.

Chapter 2
63
Getting ready
Open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file and enter the data, as shown in the 
following screenshot, into the spreadsheet:
How to do it...
1.	 In the spreadsheet, select cells A4 through E4.
2.	 Add a Bottom Border by using the Borders menu in the Font section of the Home 
tab in the spreadsheet:
3.	 Select cells A4 through A7 and add a Right Border.
4.	 Drag a Spreadsheet Table component into the canvas.
5.	 Bind the Display Data field with the spreadsheet range from A4 to E7.
6.	 Go to the Behavior tab and deselect Row in the Row Selectability section.

Data Visualization
64
7.	
Go to the Appearance tab and deselect Show Gridlines in the Layout sub-tab.
8.	 The dashboard should now look like what is shown in the following screenshot:
How it works...
The Spreadsheet Table component shows a range of cells exactly as they are formatted in 
the spreadsheet. You can add borders and colors, change fonts and alignments, and so on. If 
you make any changes to the formatting, you have to bind the cells again to the component to 
make the new formatting visible.
The data insertion options as well as the selectable options, are not used in this recipe, but 
will be explained in Chapter 3, From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard.
There's more...
The List View component and the Scorecard component are also able to show spreadsheet 
data. The main difference is that these two components don't respect any formatting used in 
the spreadsheet. The Scorecard component has a lot of alerting options (not only colors but 
also icons) and is covered in the Using alerts in a Scorecard recipe in Chapter 5, Using Alerts.
Illustrating single values
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards offers three component types to display single values: 
gauges, progress bars, and value components. A gauge and progress bar shows data on 
a scale, while the value component only shows a value in numbers. The gauge is the only 
component of these three types that has the ability to show more than one value. There are 
a number of different gauge versions available, where the progress bar has only a horizontal 
and vertical version. All these components are ideally used in combination with Alerts. Alerts 
will be discussed in Chapter 5, Using Alerts.
This recipe will show you how to set up a gauge. The other two component types work in the 
same way.
Getting ready
No preparation is needed; just open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file.

Chapter 2
65
How to do it...
1.	 Add a Gauge component to the canvas.
2.	 Enter 75 in spreadsheet cell A1 and bind this cell to the By Range field.
3.	 Select By Indicators and rename Indicator 1 to Result.
4.	 Add a second indicator by clicking on the plus button.
5.	 Rename this indicator to Target, enter 90 in the Value field, and select Type as 
Outside Marker:
6.	 Go to the Appearance tab and select the Text sub-tab. Select Show Limits and set 
size to 8.
How it works...
As you can see, binding single values works in the same way as binding data series for 
charts. The gauge component can show more than one indicator and has the option to 
enter fixed values.

Introduction
An important strength that SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards has is the amount of control 
it allows a developer to provide the user with. This leads to totally customized dashboards, 
which give users the interactivity that guides them to make the right business decisions. It is 
important that developers know what type of interactive tools are available so that they can 
utilize the power of these tools.
With the right interactivity, users can retrieve information more quickly and efficiently. This 
chapter will provide developers with recipes on interactivity, which will improve the dashboard 
user experience.
Selecting your data from a list
Filtering data into a smaller dataset is a very important feature to implement when building 
dashboards. The reason is that people want to have a large amount of data available to them, 
but they do not want to have to see all of it at once; otherwise, it will become overwhelming for 
the users. It will require the users to hunt for data, which is not the purpose of a dashboard.
In our example, we will be selecting from a list of regions that will populate a gauge 
value appropriately:
Getting ready
Have your data list ready. In our example, we will show a simple list of five elements with their 
corresponding values, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 3
69
How to do it...
1.	 Select a List Box selector from the Selectors section of the Components window and 
drag it onto the canvas.
2.	 In the general section of the List Box selector, bind the labels to A2:A6, source data 
to B2:B6, and destination to D2, as shown in the following screenshot. Select Row 
as the Insertion Type. The destination cell D2 will be the cell to which the gauge 
will be bound.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
70
3.	 Drag a gauge onto the canvas from the Single Value | Gauge section of the 
Components window. Bind the gauge data to cell D2.
4.	 Click on Preview and test your result.
How it works...
Selecting from a list of data using a selector is quite easy, as you have seen in this recipe. 
Basically, you'll need to have a set of labels to identify the list of items that you are selecting 
from. You will then need your source data which relates back to the list of items being selected 
from. In our example, we used a row one cell wide as the selected item type. If we wanted to, 
we could have even chosen a row that's 100 cells wide. Just try not to go over a width of 512 
cells, otherwise you may start running into performance issues. Finally, the destination in our 
example is one row as that is what we selected as our Insertion Type.
There's more...
We just showed you how to use the List Box selector. However, we could have used other 
selector components to accomplish the same task, such as a combobox dropdown, list 
view, label-based menu, spreadsheet table selector, and so on. It is important to choose the 
selectors that best fit your dashboard visually.
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards provides great flexibility by offering many different methods 
for Insertion Type, such as filtered rows, by row, by column, by label, by position number, and 
so on.

please refer to the recipe Using Filtered Rows later on in this chapter.
Drilling down from a chart
Being able to drill down from higher-level data to more granular data is a very important 
feature in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards. We want to be able to retrieve high-level and 
granular-level data easily without hunting for it. By using drilldowns, users can easily navigate 
through the different levels of data.
Getting ready
Insert two charts into the canvas (Parent = Column Chart; Child = Line Chart). Data in the 
child chart is driven from the parent chart.
Please refer to the example Drilling down from a chart.xlf from 
the code bundle on how to set up and bind data appropriately to the charts.
How to do it...
1.	 In our example, the parent chart contains Regional Sales information. The child 
chart contains a drilldown of a monthly trend.
2.	 Turn on the drilldown capability from the parent chart by clicking on the Insertion 
icon and then on the Enable Data Insertion checkbox.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
72
3.	 Select the Insertion Type that you will use for the drilldown bars. In our case, we will 
drill down based on Row and bind to the line chart data in cells D6:I9. Then, select 
the destination of the drilldown value. We have selected cells D3:I3 in our case.
4.	 The destination cells D3:I3 control the chart data for our monthly trend dataset as 
shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 3
73
5.	 Preview the finished example and verify that the drilldown works by clicking on each 
bar of the Regional Sales chart.
How it works...
In our example, we showed how to drill down from a set of regional sales to a monthly trend 
for a selected region. In the drilldown properties screen, the source rows D6:I9 from step 3 
are linked to each bar. When a user clicks on the bar, it will select the appropriate row from 
D6:I9 and transfer it to the destination at D3:I3, to which the child chart will bind its data.
There's more...
In our example, we had all the data available to us on the spreadsheet. We can also 
accomplish drilldown capability on a query by sending in the drilldown parameter when 
clicking on a bar and then retrieving the appropriate child data by calling the child query.
Using the Filter selector component for 
hierarchies
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards provides an easy-to-use selector component for hierarchical 
data. For example, we may have a hierarchy that consists of a Region, Sales District, and 
Sales Office. We can easily create this with the Filter component.
www.allitebooks.com

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
74
Getting ready
It is important to set up the data as shown in the following screenshot so that the Filter 
component can consume it properly. Every row has to have values for the Region, Sales 
District, and Sales Office as well as the metric value(s) that you want populated on your 
destination. We have highlighted the destination in F3 and the filter-related stuff in A3:C6 
and D3:D6. Information on how everything works can be found in the How it works... section.
How to do it...
1.	 Add a Filter component from the Selectors category onto the canvas. In the 
Properties window, set Number of Filters to 3 since our hierarchy has 
three levels.

Chapter 3
75
2.	 Bind the Source Data to the area in green (A3:D6) from the data setup in the Getting 
ready section.
3.	 Bind the Titles section to cells A2:C2.
4.	 Bind the Destination to the cell F3.
5.	 Insert a Label Text object into the canvas and bind it to destination cell F3.
6.	 Preview and make sure the Filter component works.
How it works...
The Filter selector component works by grouping values in each column of the source data. 
In our example, we selected three filters, so the first three columns of the source data will 
consist of the three hierarchies. The main parent is Region, which then branches down 
to District, and finally Office.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
76
Now that we are familiar with the cells colored in blue from the image in the Getting ready 
section of this recipe, we'll explain what the cell in yellow is. The destination cell F3 can be 
of arbitrary width and will consist of metrics or values associated with the chosen hierarchy 
combination. For example, if we select East | District 1 | Office 1, it will retrieve the values 
corresponding to that combination row.
Note that the destination width is the same as the second part of the source data (D3:D6), 
which in our case is one column.
There's more...
The Filter component isn't the only way to select from a hierarchical approach. We can also try 
a more advanced method found in the next recipe, An alternative hierarchy selection method, 
which will show the hierarchies in a set of list boxes. This may be the preferred approach if 
a user wants to see more than one value at a time. In addition, the recipe Presenting micro 
charts in a Tree Grid, found in Chapter 10, Top Third-party Add-ons, will show users how 
a third-party component can accomplish a hierarchy selection using the familiar Windows 
tree explorer.
An alternative hierarchy selection method
When navigating through hierarchy selection, often a user would want to see a list of available 
parents or children, instead of only being able to see one at a time, when looking at a 
set of drop-down filters. Here is an alternative method using the more complex list box 
breadcrumb-type approach for three levels.
Getting ready
Set up the data as shown in the following screenshot. Columns A to C contain the initial full 
hierarchical data. The sections E to G, I to J, and L each contain a breadcrumb trail whose 
source is one column less than the parent. More about how everything works will be explained 
in the How it works... section.

Chapter 3
77
How to do it...
1.	 Insert three List Box selectors onto the canvas. On the first List Box selector, which 
belongs to Region, set the Labels to the values of column A (A2:A13).
2.	 Select Filtered Rows as the Insertion Type and set the Source Data to columns A 
to C. Set the Destination to columns E to G. Notice that we select all three source 
columns because the first column of the first row of the destination contains the 
selected region.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
78
3.	 Do the same with the next list box (District); select the labels and filtered rows from 
columns F to G.
4.	 Finally, the Office list box will be getting its Labels value from the column J. You 
can either use Label or Row as the Insertion Type as we are only down to one 
selection column.

Chapter 3
79
How it works...
In this example, each list box is a hierarchical level. In order to transfer all the appropriate 
values from one parent to the next data source, we must use the Filtered Rows method to 
grab all of the parent's children, until the last child, where we can use label or row for the 
insertion type.

For more detailed information on using Filtered Rows, read the Using Filtered Rows recipe 
later in this chapter.
Using the Hierarchical Table
The Hierarchical Table is a powerful component that was introduced in SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards 4.0 FP3. It allows users to connect to either a BEx query connection or an OLAP 
universe and take advantage of its hierarchical display and multi-selection capability.
Before the Hierarchical Table was introduced, there was no way to accomplish native 
hierarchical display and selection without significant workarounds.
Although the Hierarchical Table component is extremely powerful, please note 
that it can only be used with either a BEx query or an OLAP universe. It will not 
work on a universe based on a relational database.
Getting ready
Before you can take advantage of the Hierarchical Table component, you must have an OLAP 
universe or a BEx query connection available. In our example, we create a simple cube from 
the Adventureworks data warehouse, which is easily accessible from MSDN.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
80
You can download the Adventureworks data warehouse available at 
http://msftdbprodsamples.codeplex.com/releases/view/105902.
To set up a simple cube, please follow the instructions available at 
http://www.accelebrate.com/library/tutorials/ssas-2008.
To set up an OLAP connection to the cube, please follow the instructions available at 
http://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/BOBJ/Setting+up+OLAP+Microsoft+A
nalysis+Service+through+an+XMLA+connection+with+SSO.
Finally, you will have to set up an OLAP universe that connects to the OLAP connection. 
Instructions for this can be found at http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-22026.
How to do it…
1.	 Create an OLAP universe query / BEx query from the Query Browser.
For instructions on how to create a query from the Query Browser, 
please refer to the Using the Query Browser recipe in Chapter 8, 
Dashboard Data Connectivity.

Chapter 3
81
2.	 From the Components window, go to the Selectors category and drag a Hierarchical 
Table component onto the dashboard canvas.
3.	 Click on the Bind to Query Data button and choose the query that you created in 
step 1. Next, choose the dimensions and measures that you want displayed on the 
Hierarchical Table. By default, you must select at least one hierarchy dimension.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
82
4.	 Click on the Configure Columns button below the data binding to adjust the column 
widths on the Hierarchical Table. We do this because by default, SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards does not set the column widths very well when we first bind the data.
5.	 On the Appearance tab, edit the number formats for each measure appropriately. 
For example, you can set dollar amounts as the currency with two decimal places.
6.	 Next, we want to capture rows that are selected during runtime. To do this, click on 
the Insertion tab. For the Insertion Type, you have the option of Value or Row.
7.	
For the Value insertion option, you must choose an option for Source Data, which is 
one of the columns in the Hierarchical Table.
8.	 In our example, we will choose the Insertion Type as Row, which grabs values from 
all the columns. We'll need to bind the output destination. We will assume that a 
user can select a maximum of 30 rows. So we'll bind the output to a 30 x 3 
destination range.

Chapter 3
83
9.	 Bind a spreadsheet table object to the destination output from step 8 to prove that 
our selection works.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
84
10.	 Finally, test the Hierarchical Table by entering preview mode. In the following 
screenshot, you can see that we can expand/collapse our Hierarchical Table, 
as well as make multiple selections!
How it works...
As you can see, the Hierarchical Table selector is a very useful component because before 
this component was available, we were unable to perform any form of hierarchical analysis 
as well as simple multi-selection. The component achieves hierarchical capabilities by taking 
advantage of the OLAP cube engine.
There's more…
Unfortunately, the Hierarchical Table selector is only available from cube sources and not a 
traditional data warehouse table, because it uses the OLAP cube engine to do the processing.
The hierarchical capability, in our opinion, is doable with data warehouse tables as other tools 
allow this. So hopefully, SAP will one day upgrade the Hierarchical Table selector so that it 
works with your traditional data warehouse universe based on tables.
Using Filtered Rows
Filtered Rows was one of the greatest additions to Xcelsius 2008 (now SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards 4.1) from Xcelsius 4.5. If we look at the following screenshot, we see that we 
have a set of Sales metrics that are grouped by Region and Office:

Chapter 3
85
Let's say we want to be able to select a region and show a sales comparison chart between 
the different sales offices of that region. Before the advent of Filtered Rows, we would have 
had to perform a complex VLOOKUP or have the result come back through a query every time 
a region was selected. Both methods are very time consuming.
How to do it...
1.	 We will use a Combo Box selector to choose the desired region.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
86
2.	 In the Combo Box selector properties, bind the Labels to the Region column.
3.	 Select Filtered Rows as the Insertion Type. Bind Source Data to cells A3:C12. The 
Destination will contain the chart values as well as the selected region.

Chapter 3
87
4.	 Bind the chart values to the Destination section from step 3.
How it works...
The Filtered Rows insertion type allows users to select groupings of data easily without having 
to implement complex VLOOKUP logic or database querying. It allows for performance gains 
and eases future maintenance.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard

Using maps to select data of an area or 
country
Using maps on a dashboard allows us to visually identify data using a picture instead of a 
table/chart, for example to analyze which regions of an area are doing poorly versus which 
regions are doing well. As you can see by looking at the following map of Canada, users are 
able to visually distinguish between each province:
How to do it...
1.	 Select a map component from the Maps section. In our example, we will use Canada.

Chapter 3
89
2.	 In the map's properties, bind the region keys as shown in the following screenshot.
Tip to find map regions:
A full list of the region keys for each map included in SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards can be found in the MapRegions.xls spreadsheet in the 
<install path>\Xcelsius 4.0\assets\samples\User Guide 
Samples\ directory.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
90
3.	 Next, bind the Display Data, which will be the key/value pair. The key comes from the 
key that you used in step 2 and the value can be any value associated with that key.
4.	 Now bind the Source Data. Make sure that the first column of the Source Data 
contains the matching key value from step 2.
5.	 Bind the Destination to the cells D3:E3.

Chapter 3
91
6.	 Now, drag a Spreadsheet Table component onto the canvas and bind the Display 
Data to cells D3:E3. This will change according to the province you click on 
during runtime.
How it works...
The map component works by using a key/value pair that is assigned to each map section. 
It is important that the order of items bound to the Region section is in alphabetical order. 
Otherwise, the wrong keys will be bound. For example, in the following screenshot, Yukon and 
Nova Scotia are in the wrong alphabetical order. Thus, the key/value pair will be incorrect.
The Display Data section in step 3 is used to show what will be displayed as a user hovers 
the mouse over a region. There are two columns that can be shown (key/value). The key must 
match the key that was bound to the Region data; otherwise it, will not show up.
Finally, we have our Source Data, and again we must have a matching key in the first column 
in order to match the correct row.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
92
There's more...
To make the visualization even better for a map component, it is common to use alert coloring 
to show how the provinces are doing. To accomplish this, please read the Displaying alerts on 
a map recipe in Chapter 5, Using Alerts.
Adding a Mac OS X-looking dock to your 
dashboard
It is well known that Macs have a great user interface, and one of the great things about 
this interface is the program loading dock. We can emulate this in SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards using the Fisheye Picture Menu selector. But why would someone want to use 
the loading dock? Well, you can use the loading dock to switch between dashboards on the 
main dashboard. You can use it to open up another dashboard, or you can use it as a selector 
to change your charts or data. In this recipe, we are going to emulate swapping between 
dashboards.

Chapter 3
93
How to do it...
1.	 Select the Fisheye Picture Menu selector.
2.	 We'll need to link an image of each dashboard to the fisheye menu. To do this, press 
the Import button on the Images Embedded section of the fisheye menu properties. 
In our example, we are using three dashboards. So click on the Click to Add Images 
button to load each of the three dashboard images.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
94
3.	 Bind the Labels to the spreadsheet as shown so that the user knows the name of the 
dashboard when they hover over any of the icons:
4.	 Bind the Source Data and Destination. In this case, we are just using Position for 
the source. Bind the Destination to cell D2.

Chapter 3
95
5.	 Set the dynamic visibility of each dashboard to the corresponding position of the 
fisheye menu selector. For example, the HR Health Assessment dashboard has 
position 1, so in the dashboard properties, the dynamic visibility should be 
set to 1 for cell D2.
How it works...
The Fisheye Picture Menu is a very simple component similar to the Mac OS X loading dock. 
It allows users to scroll through icons that will zoom in as you hover over them. As outlined in 
step 2, we can see that we have to bind images that are similar to program icons. Those icons 
are linked to the Source Data in step 4.
There's more...
There is another component called the Sliding Picture Menu that acts the same way and is 
set up the same way as the Fisheye Picture Menu, except that you don't get the zoom upon 
mouseover feature.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
96
Resetting your data (the reset button)
It is common that a user may want to go back to their default or starting view. Let's say I have 
five selectors and I have modified all five of them. To get back to the starting point would be a 
pain. Thus, having a one-click approach to go back to default is useful.
How to do it...
Select the Reset Button option from the Other components section and drag it onto 
the canvas.
How it works...
When you first load the dashboard, the state of the first load is remembered. So when you 
click on the Reset button, it will go back to the original state.
Warning: Using the Reset button will reset the whole dashboard and not just 
certain components.
Making selections from a custom image 
(the push button and image component)
As shown in the Adding a Mac OS X-looking dock to your dashboard recipe, we can use a 
Fisheye Picture Menu to emulate a program-dock-type style when selecting items. However, 
there may be cases where we may want images in different locations that we can click on to 
perform different actions.

Chapter 3
97
In this recipe, we will go through an example of how to use a push button combined with an 
Image Component to create a clickable image that can perform actions when clicked.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag an Image Component from the Arts and Backgrounds section of the 
Components window onto the canvas.
2.	 Open up the image properties window and click on the Import button. Select the 
image from your computer that you want to show.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
98
3.	 Drag a Push Button object from the Selectors section of the Components window 
and put it on top of the image. Then, resize the Push Button so that it is the same 
size as the image. To make the button the same size as the image, use the sizing 
icons on the toolbar circled in red, as shown in the following screenshot. Make sure 
you click on the image first and then on the push button in order for the push button 
to match the sizing properties of the image, and not the other way round.
4.	 In the Push Button properties, first bind the Source Data and Destination to the 
appropriate cells. In our example, we want to transfer the table data from the yellow 
section to the destination section highlighted with a black border. Also, in the Label 
section, don't forget to delete all text.

Chapter 3
99
5.	 Go to the Appearance tab of the push button and set the Transparency to 100%. 
Then, uncheck the Show Button Background checkbox.
6.	 Drag a Spreadsheet Table component onto the canvas and bind it to the destination 
cells D2:E6 of the push button.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
100
7.	
Preview and make sure that when you click on the image, the details of the image 
show up on the table.
How it works...
In this recipe, we overlay a Push Button on top of an Image Component. By default, an image 
component can't perform any actions. However, with an invisible push button on top, it will 
seem as though we can click on the image to perform an action.

For more information on formatting objects in terms of sizing and alignment and setting the 
appearance of objects, please read Chapter 7, Dashboard Look and Feel.
Inputting data values
The ability to input values into the dashboard is a very useful feature. In the following example, 
we have a sales forecast that changes according to an inputted number value. If we were to 
use a slider component for the input value, it would be more difficult for the user to select 
their desired input value. Another good example could be a search box to find a value on a 
selector which has over 100 items. This way you don't need to hunt for your value. Instead, 
you can just type it in.
In this recipe, we will create an input textbox to control a what-if scenario.

Chapter 3
101
Getting ready
Create a chart with its values bound to cells that will be controlled by the input textbox 
value. The following is an example of a sales forecast chart and its cells that are controlled 
by the what-if scenario:
You may refer to the source file Inputting data values.xlf from the 
code bundle to retrieve the pre-populated data from the preceding image if 
you don't want to manually type everything in yourself.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag an Input Text object from the Text section of the Components window onto 
the canvas.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
102
2.	 In the properties window of the Input Text component, bind the Link to Cell as well 
as Destination to cell D3 from the Getting ready section.
3.	 Go to the Behavior icon of the input text properties and make sure Treat All Input As 
Text is unchecked.
4.	 The blue cell D6 from the Getting ready section that's labeled as valid value will 
check to make sure the input text entered by the user is valid. To do this, we use 
the following formula:
=IF(ISNUMBER(D3),IF(AND(D3>=-20,D3<=20),D3,"INVALID"),"INVAL
ID")

Chapter 3
103
The formula checks to make sure that the cell contains a number that is 
between -20 and 20.
Now every cell in the chart binding destination will depend on D6. The binding 
destination cells will not add the D6 value if D6 is "INVALID". In addition, 
a pop up will appear saying "Input is invalid" if D6 is "INVALID".
5.	 Create the pop up by dragging a Label text component onto the canvas with Input is 
invalid as its text. Next, go to the behavior tab and for dynamic visibility, bind it to D6 
and set the Key as INVALID.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
104
How it works...
In this example, we use an input value textbox to control the forecast bars on the chart. If we 
type 20, it will add 20 to each value in the forecast. If we type -20, it will subtract 20 from 
each value in the forecast.
We also add a check in step 4 that determines whether the value entered is valid or not; 
hence the use of Excel formulas. If a value is invalid, we want to output an error to the 
user so that they are aware that they entered an invalid value.

Using the Play Selector / Play Control 
component
The Play Selector component can be used when you want to change chart values or 
components on a dashboard without having the user do anything. Some common uses where 
we need an automatic change of components are listed as follows:
f
f
A company dashboard presented on a large LCD monitor in a company common 
room; this dashboard will refresh or switch views every 20-30 seconds

Chapter 3
105
f
f
A dashboard at a technical support office that shows information on calls 
coming in and how they are being handled; this dashboard will change views 
every 20-30 seconds
In this recipe, we will create a Play Selector component that changes the image every 20 
seconds. We can pretend that the images are different dashboards.
Getting ready
Have a set of three images ready on the canvas, and overlay them on top of each other.
There are three dashboard images that you may use for this example. 
They are hr1.png, hr2.png, and hr3.png, and can be found in the 
images folder.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
106
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Play Selector component from the Selector section of the Components 
window onto the canvas.
2.	 In the Play Selector properties, select Row as the Insertion Type and bind the Source 
Data to the dynamic visibility rows that are set up in Column A of the spreadsheet. 
Bind the Destination to cell C2, which will control the image to be shown.

Chapter 3
107
3.	 Go to the Behavior icon of the Play Selector properties and check the Auto Play 
checkbox. Change the Play Time value to 20 seconds.
4.	 Go to the Appearance icon of the Play Selector properties and set the Transparency 
to 100%. Also uncheck all the checkboxes.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
108
5.	 On each of the image components, set the Dynamic Visibility status binding on 
the Behavior icon to the yellow colored destination cell C2 from step 2. The key 
values will be 1, 2, or 3 depending on which order you want your images to play 
in. In the following screenshot, we've shown the dynamic visibility example for the 
first dashboard:
How it works...
In this example, we use a play selector to control which image is being shown. In each 
20-second iteration of the play selector, the next row from the Source Data range will be 
moved into the destination cell C2. In step 4, we set the transparency of the play selector to 
100% because we wanted to hide the play selector but still have it active. Finally, in step 5, we 
configured the dynamic visibilities of the images appropriately so the correct one shows up 
as the play selector runs.

Opening up a Web Intelligence report using 
dashboard parameters
It is important to distinguish between a dashboard and a report. A dashboard should be a 
one-page visualization of the most important data a user needs to see. A report contains 
details that are usually of the lowest granularity, and thus should remain at the SAP 
BusinessObjects Web Intelligence (Webi) report level. It is a common dashboard requirement 
to drill down from a chart or scorecard to view individual details. Instead of showing the 
detailed items on the dashboard, we can pop up a Webi report using parameters passed from 
the dashboard. In this example, we will pop up a Webi report using one input parameter from 
the dashboard.
Getting ready
A Webi report with a prompt must be set up first. In our example, the Webi report will ask for a 
Region parameter.
You can use the source file Opening up a Web Intelligence 
report using dashboard parameters.xlf from the code 
bundle as a reference to help guide you through the OpenDocument 
URL construction part of the recipe.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
110
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Combo Box selector onto the canvas and bind the label values to the list of 
Regions on the Excel spreadsheet as shown in the following screenshot. Set Label as 
the Insertion Type and bind the Destination to the cell highlighted in yellow, which 
will be the input parameter passed to the OpenDoc call.
2.	 Log in to BI Launchpad (formerly Infoview) and go to the location where the Web 
Intelligence report is placed. Right-click and select Document Link.

Chapter 3

3.	 Copy the static portion of the Opendoc URL as well as the reference CUID. Every 
object in the SAP BusinessObjects repository has a unique CUID reference identifier.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
112
4.	 An OpenDocument URL is constructed in cell B14 as shown in the following 
screenshot. Paste the CUID from step 3 onto cell B23. Cell C23 equals the 
Selected Region destination cell, C2 (Sheet 1), from step 1.
5.	 Drag a URL Button component onto the canvas from the Web Connectivity section 
of the Components window. In the URL Button properties, change the Label text to 
Open WEBI report, and bind the URL to the OpenDoc URL cell B14 from step 2.
How it works...
In this example, we use what is called an OpenDocument call to open up a Webi report with 
our desired input parameter from the dashboard.
The OpenDocument URL is quite powerful and has many options, so it is best to read the 
OpenDocument manual in order to fully understand what is available. You can find the 
URLs to retrieve the OpenDocument manual in the following See also section.

Chapter 3
113
The URL Button component is used to open up an external link from the dashboard. An 
example of a fully constructed URL is as follows:
http://server:8080/businessobjects/BOE/OpenDocument/opendoc/
openDocument.jsp?sIDType=CUID&iDocID=ARCpEmaZO9tBqYhkX7sh6Nw&lsSRegio
n=EAST
There's more...
The syntax for OpenDocument in SAP BusinessObjects 4.1 is different from previous versions; 
however, the concept is the same. In this recipe, the OpenDocument URL was generated for 
SAP BusinessObjects BI 4.1+.

Selecting calendar dates
A calendar is a common component found in dashboards if a user is interested in seeing 
values on a particular day. This is great for going back in history to see past performance.
In this example, we will work with one month of data for September 2010, and the chart will 
change according to what the user selects on the calendar.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
114
Getting ready
The portion of the spreadsheet containing the chart data will need to be set up in the 
following fashion. Each row of chart data will belong to a selectable day in the calendar. 
In this example, each row contains region sales data for a particular date.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Calendar component from the Other section of the Components window onto 
the canvas.
2.	 In the calendar properties, select Date as the Insertion Type and bind the 
Destination to the cell G3 of the spreadsheet, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 3
115
3.	 Now, we will need to take the value from the destination date cell G3 in step 2 to 
find the corresponding row data from the Getting ready section. To do this, drag a 
Combo Box selector onto the canvas. In the Combo Box properties, select Row 
as the Insertion Type and bind Source Data to the chart dataset. Then, bind the 
Destination to the cells in the spreadsheet area in yellow (H3:K3). Set the Labels 
to the date values of the dataset.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
116
4.	 On the Behavior icon of the Combo Box selector, bind the Item from the Selected 
Item area to the Destination cell G3 of the calendar set from step 2. Then, drag the 
Combo Box selector to the same position as the chart, and order the Combo Box 
selector to the back of other components so that the user does not see the Combo 
Box selector during runtime.
5.	 Bind the chart data to the chart destination cells H3:K3 from step 3.

Chapter 3
117
How it works...
In this example, we used a combination of a Calendar date component, a Combo Box 
selector, and a Column Chart component. The Calendar date component controls the date 
selected in step 1. Then, the Combo Box selector connects the date to the appropriate data 
row from the chart dataset in steps 3 and 4. Finally, in step 5, the chart is bound to the 
correct data row that was selected in steps 3 and 4.
Watch out for date format issues when using dates. The date in the dataset 
may not match up properly with the date value that comes back from the 
Calendar component.

selector in Chapter 2, Data Visualization.
Using sliders to create a what-if scenario
What-if scenarios are very important as they allow users to project what future values will look 
like depending on one or more variables.
In our recipe, we will reuse the simple what-if scenario from a previous recipe, Inputting data 
values. The only difference here is that we will use a horizontal slider instead of inputting the 
values with text.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
118
Getting ready
Set up the sales data as shown circled in red in the following screenshot, and have a column 
chart ready on the canvas. You can also reuse the column chart from the previous recipe.
How to do it...
1.	 Insert a Horizontal Slider component from the Single Value | Horizontal Slider 
section of the Components window into the canvas.

Chapter 3
119
2.	 Set the Title text to Forecasted Change. Bind the Data to cell D3 highlighted 
in yellow. Set the Minimum Limit to -20 and Maximum Limit to 20 in the 
Scale section.
3.	 Go to the Appearance section of the slider properties and make sure that the Limits 
checkbox is checked.

From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard
120
4.	 Now, in the blue chart data area, each formula will be adding the what-if value D3 to 
the chart data values B3:B6 prepared in the Getting ready section.
5.	 Bind the Forecast Chart values in cells F2:G6 to the Chart Component and then 
click on Preview.
How it works...
In this example, the slider controls the what-if value in cell D3. The chart data cells take the 
user's what-if rate and add it to the current sales values.

Introduction
Dynamic visibility makes it possible to control the visibility of components on the dashboard. 
With this functionality, a component can be made visible or hidden on a running dashboard, 
based on a status value that is inserted in a certain spreadsheet cell.
Dynamic visibility is useful when your dashboard contains many visual components and 
you don't want to overload the user with information. Usually, it is used in combination with 
selectors that let the users choose what they want to see and when.
Switching between different charts
This recipe will show you how to create a dashboard with the option of switching between 
two charts.
Getting ready
Open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file and drag two different chart components 
(for example, a Line Chart and a Pie Chart component) into the empty canvas. Drag the Label 
Based Menu component found in Selectors into the canvas as well.

Dynamic Visibility
122
How to do it...
1.	 Click on the Line Chart component and go to the Behavior tab of its properties pane. 
At the bottom of the pane, you will see a section called Dynamic Visibility.
2.	 Bind the Status field to spreadsheet cell B1.
3.	 Put value 1 in the Key field:
4.	 Click on the Pie Chart component and go to the Behavior tab.
5.	 Here also, bind the Status field to cell B1.
6.	 In the Key field, fill in the value 2:
7.	
Go to the spreadsheet and type Status: in cell A1 and put value 1 in cell B1:
8.	 Now click on the Label Based Menu component and go to the General tab of its 
properties pane.
9.	 To set the Labels, click on the button on the extreme right-hand side, as shown 
in the following screenshot:

Chapter 4
123
10.	 Enter two labels: Trend and Division. Make sure that Trend has the first position 
and Division has the second position. You can change the positions by using 
the little arrows on the bottom left-hand side of the window. In addition, by default 
there are five entries. To remove the other three entries, just click on the X icons 
to the right.
11.	 In the Data Insertion area, set Insertion Type to Position.
12.	Bind the Destination field to spreadsheet cell B1:
13.	Click on the Preview button to run the dashboard. You will only see the label-based 
component. Click on Trend or Division and the appropriate chart will appear. Now 
leave preview mode.

Dynamic Visibility
124
14.	 To display an initial chart (shown before the first selection), deselect the Clear 
Destination When No Selected Item option in the General tab of the properties 
of the Label Based Menu component.
15.	Place both charts on top of each other. Use the options in the Format menu for 
precise alignment and sizing:
16.	 Try your dashboard!
How it works...
In this recipe, we used one of the selector components in combination with the Dynamic 
Visibility functionality to switch between the two charts. Each chart has a unique key 
assigned: value 1 for the line chart and value 2 for the pie chart. By making a selection in the 
Label Based Menu selector, either the value 1 or value 2 was inserted into spreadsheet cell 
B1. The Dynamic Visibility setup in this recipe implies that if cell B1 has value 1, Line Chart 
will be shown. If cell B1 has value 2, the Pie Chart will be shown.
Thus, a component is hidden when any other value than its key is entered in the status cell.

Chapter 4
125
There's more...
This recipe used two chart components with Dynamic Visibility settings. But, the Dynamic 
Visibility functionality is embedded in all other components too, except for the Source Data 
component and the History component. You can even use Dynamic Visibility with grouped 
components to dynamically show or hide a group of components!
When you set up Dynamic Visibility you are not restricted to using only numerical values; you 
can use any value you want as a Dynamic Visibility key for a component. If you do this, make 
sure you also change the Insertion Type of your selector component into Label. The labels 
should always match the key exactly.
Label keys are case sensitive!
Building a pop-up screen
This recipe will show how a pop-up screen can be created within a dashboard. Such a pop-up 
screen can, for example, be used to provide additional information related to the content of 
the dashboard. In this recipe, the pop-up screen can be activated and deactivated by clicking 
on buttons.
Getting ready
No specific preparation is needed for this recipe. You can use any dashboard you already 
created or just start with an empty one. In this example, we will use the dashboard from 
the previous recipe.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Background component into the canvas from the Art and Backgrounds 
category.

Dynamic Visibility
126
2.	 Drag the Label component from the Text category, place it on top of the Background 
component, and enter some text:
3.	 Now, drag a Push Button component from the Selectors category into the canvas 
and position it in the upper right-hand side corner of the Background component. 
Rename its label as Close. We will use this button to close the pop-up screen:
4.	 Set up the spreadsheet. Enter value 1 in cell E1 and value 0 in cell E2:
5.	 Bind the Source Data field in the Push Button component properties to spreadsheet 
cell E2 and bind the Destination field to cell E3:

Chapter 4
127
6.	 Group the three components (see the Grouping the canvas components recipe in 
Chapter 1, Staying in Control).
7.	
Add another Push Button component to the canvas and rename its label Info. 
This button will be used to activate the pop-up screen.
8.	 Bind the Source Data field of this second Push Button component to spreadsheet 
cell E1 and bind the Destination field to cell E3:
9.	 Now we are ready to set up the Dynamic Visibility functionality. Select the grouped 
components and go to the properties pane. You will see only one Common tab now. 
Bind the Status field to spreadsheet cell E3. Also, enter the value 1 in the Key field:

Dynamic Visibility
128
10.	 Preview the dashboard to test the functionality!
How it works...
In this recipe, we combined the Push Button functionality with Dynamic Visibility. The three 
grouped components are only visible when the Dynamic Visibility status is 1 (spreadsheet 
cell E3). When clicking on the Info push button, the value 1 is put into spreadsheet cell E3, 
following which the grouped components appear. After clicking on the Close push button, the 
value 0 is put into this cell and the grouped components disappear as the status cell does not 
match value 1 anymore.
There's more...
After clicking on the Info push button, the pop-up screen appears. Now this button does not 
have any useful functionality. Nothing happens if you click it as the pop-up screen is already 
active. To make this button disappear, you can easily use the Dynamic Visibility functionality 
you already set up by following these steps:
1.	 Go to the Behavior tab of the Info push button properties pane.
2.	 Bind the Status field to spreadsheet cell E3 and enter value 0 into the Key field.

Chapter 4
129
3.	 Now preview the dashboard to see the effect.
Creating a mouseover help text popup
This recipe shows how you can create a pop-up screen that is activated by making the mouse 
hover over a certain area of the dashboard. This can be handy if you want to add some minor 
information on a specific part of a dashboard.
Getting ready
No specific preparation is needed for this recipe. You can use any dashboard you already 
created or just start with an empty one. In this example, we are reusing the dashboard we 
created in the previous two recipes.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Chart component (for example, a Pie Chart component) into the canvas. If 
you are using an existing dashboard, you can use one of the components of your 
dashboard instead.
2.	 Drag a Label component found in the Selectors category into the canvas and enter 
the text you want to show.
3.	 Go to the properties pane of this Label component. Select the Appearance tab and 
select the Show Fill option.

Dynamic Visibility
130
4.	 Now, select the Show Border option and set Border Thickness to 2:
5.	 Move the Label component over the chart:
6.	 Now drag a Toggle Button component, found in the Selectors category, into the 
canvas and position it on top of the title of the chart you added to the canvas in 
step 1. Resize it so that it covers the total area above the chart, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 4
131
7.	
In the Toggle Button properties pane, go to the General tab. Bind Destination to 
spreadsheet cell H1:
8.	 Insert value 0 into cell H1:

Dynamic Visibility
132
9.	 Now go to the Behavior tab. Under Interaction Options in the Common menu, 
change Mouse Click to Mouse Over:
10.	 Now go to the Appearance tab and set the Transparency to 100% under the 
Layout menu:
11.	 Also, under the Text menu within the Appearance tab, deselect the Show Labels 
option. Now the component won't be visible anymore on the canvas:

Chapter 4
133
12.	To finish this recipe, we have to set up the Dynamic Visibility functionality for the 
Label component. First, select the Label component. Go to the Behavior tab in 
the properties pane. Within the Dynamic Visibility section, bind the Status field 
to spreadsheet cell H1. Also put value 1 into the Key field:

Dynamic Visibility
134
13.	Now your dashboard is ready to be tested. Hit the Preview button and see 
what happens!
How it works...
For this recipe, we used the Toggle Button functionality in combination with Dynamic 
Visibility. Also, instead of clicking on Toggle Button to activate it, we switched the insertion 
trigger from Mouse Click to Mouse Over. If you run the dashboard and make the mouse hover 
over the area covered by Toggle Button, it will insert value 1 into spreadsheet cell H1. This 
cell triggers Dynamic Visibility of the Label component that will now appear.
If you go to the properties pane of the Toggle Button component, you can set Source Data, 
which is in the General tab. Here, you can define which values should be put into the 
Destination cell:

Chapter 4
135
The following screenshot shows the Source Data table:
Keep in mind that if you cover a certain section of your dashboard with 
a Toggle Button component to evoke the Mouse Over activation, the 
interactivity options of the underlying components cannot be activated 
by the user anymore as Toggle Button is blocking it!
Password protecting your dashboard
In this recipe, we will look at a scenario that uses some basic login functionality for a 
dashboard created with SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards. Before you can use the actual 
functionality of the dashboard, a password has to be entered.
Getting ready
For this recipe you can use any dashboard you created earlier. We will use the dashboard 
we created in the previous recipes.

Dynamic Visibility
136
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Rectangle component found in the Art and Backgrounds area into the 
canvas and resize it so that it covers the whole dashboard:
2.	 Go to the properties pane of the Rectangle component and switch the Fill Type 
setting from None to Solid. You can also change the color and the level of 
transparency here:

Chapter 4
137
3.	 The result should look like what is shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 Add a Label component from the Selectors area to the canvas and place it in the 
middle of the dashboard.
5.	 Enter Please enter your password: in the Layout menu of the Appearance 
tab. You can check the Show Fill option to show a background color for this 
component:

Dynamic Visibility
138
The canvas should look like what is shown in the following screenshot:
6.	 Now add an Input Text component and place it below the Label component. In the 
General tab of the properties pane, bind the Destination field to spreadsheet cell K2. 
In the Behavior tab, check the option to Enable Password Protection. This ensures 
that only asterisks (*) are displayed when the user enters the password.
7.	
Select the three components you just added and group them.

Chapter 4
139
8.	 Go to the properties pane for the grouped components. It is time to set up Dynamic 
Visibility. Bind the Status option to spreadsheet cell K1. Enter value 1 in the 
Key field:
9.	 Now we have to set up some Excel logic to make this work. In spreadsheet cell K1, 
enter the =IF(K2="YourPassword",0,1) formula, where YourPassword should 
be replaced with a password of your choice.
10.	 Your spreadsheet should now look like what is shown in the following screenshot:
11.	 Hit the Preview button and try to log in to this dashboard by entering your password.
How it works...
In this recipe, the Dynamic Visibility functionality is used to make some parts of the 
dashboard disappear instead of showing them. The Dynamic Visibility status is now set by 
an Excel formula. This if then formula checks whether the value in the Input Text component 
matches YourPassword or not. If it does match, the result of the formula will be 0 and the 
layer we put on top of the dashboard will disappear. Now you can use the dashboard.
This is a method that can be used to protect your dashboard from 
unauthorized access. However, in an enterprise environment, 
when the dashboard is published in the SAP BusinessObjects BI 
Platform, the security is managed by the platform.

Introduction
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards provides a flexible way of alerting a user when something 
special has occurred. This can be a variety of events, both positive and negative. For example, 
if certain offices have hit a target threshold for sales, we may want to show these to highlight 
the positives. If offices fall below a certain threshold for sales, we may also want to highlight 
these so that we can compare the offices and figure out how to improve the lagging offices.
Adding alerts to a column chart
When looking at a column chart, we might want to see which items are below or above a 
particular threshold. In this recipe, you will learn how to add alerts to a column chart. Our 
example will consist of a column chart with a list of regions and their sales. Each region 
column will be colored appropriately, depending on its sales value versus threshold.

Using Alerts
142
Getting ready
Make sure you set up the sales data and threshold values as shown in the following 
screenshot. You'll also need to insert a Column Chart component into the canvas.

Chapter 5
143
How to do it...
1.	 First, bind the sales data to the chart as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Go to the Alerts section of the chart properties and ensure that Enable Alerts 
is checked.
3.	 Select alerts By Value as we will be comparing our sales data to the threshold values.
4.	 In the Alert Thresholds section, click on the Use a Range checkbox. Bind the data 
to the threshold data that was set up in the Getting ready section.

Using Alerts
144
5.	 In the Color Order section, select the radio button High values are good.
6.	 In the following screenshot, you will then see that the bars on the chart are now 
colored according to the sales thresholds:

Chapter 5
145
How it works...
In this recipe, binding the initial data is straightforward, but the part you'll want to take note 
of is setting up the alerts.
Note that there will always be N-1 (N minus one) number of threshold values 
if you are binding the range to your data. For example, if I had two colors (red 
and green), I would only have one threshold value. If I had four colors, I would 
have three threshold values set up on my spreadsheet.
In step 4, we bind the threshold range to cells D3 and E3 prepared in the Getting ready 
section. Anything that is equal to or greater than the yellow threshold value but less than the 
green threshold value will be colored as yellow. Anything that is equal to or greater than the 
green threshold value will be green.
There's more...
Let's say you wanted to display a critical alert that would stand out even if one region was 
below a threshold. You can accomplish this by following the Using bindable colors to control 
alert coloring from a central location recipe.
Making alert ranges dynamic
It is common that different dimensions contain different thresholds for alert metrics. For 
example, sales threshold targets may be different for each region of a company, as shown 
in the following screenshot:
In our example, we have four regions and different thresholds for each region. So anything 
below the yellow threshold value will be red, anything that is equal to or greater than the 
yellow threshold but less than the green threshold will be yellow, and anything equal to or 
greater than the green threshold value will be green.

Using Alerts
146
This recipe contains a column chart that contains monthly values for a selected region. As the 
user changes their region selection, the alert threshold will also change. The appropriate alert 
coloring for each bar will be displayed on the chart.
Getting ready
We will have one worksheet that contains the threshold values as well as a spot that will 
house the thresholds for the selected region. Please refer to the first screenshot from the 
introductory section of this recipe. This is how the threshold data layout will look. There 
will be another worksheet called Chart Data that will contain the chart data.
How to do it...
1.	 Insert a Column Chart and a Combo Box selector into the canvas.

Chapter 5
147
2.	 Open the Combo Box selector properties and bind Title and Labels to the cells 
shown in the following screenshot:

Using Alerts
148
3.	 Set up the threshold value by linking to the appropriate label. In the Data Insertion 
section of the Combo Box properties, rename the text to Threshold. Then, set 
Insertion Type as Row. Bind Source Data to cells A2:C5 in the Thresholds sheet. 
Bind Destination to the section highlighted in yellow (E3:G3).
4.	 Next, press the + button in the Data Insertion section to add another row selection. 
Name the next insertion type as Chart Data. Set Insertion Type to Row. Go to the 
Chart Data worksheet, bind Source Data to cells A2:F5, and then bind Destination 
to cells H3:M3.

Chapter 5
149
5.	 Bind the chart data to the Chart Data worksheet cells that we populated from step 4. 
Set the Subtitle of the chart to cell H3, which contains the selected region name.

Using Alerts
150
6.	 Go to the Alerts section of the chart properties and check the Enable Alerts checkbox.
7.	
Select the radio button that says By Value.
8.	 In the Alert Thresholds section, check the Use a Range checkbox and bind to cells 
F3:G3 in the Thresholds worksheet.
9.	 In the Color Order section, select the radio button that says High values are good.

Chapter 5
151
How it works...
In our example, we bind the alert thresholds in steps 6 through 9 to the cells that dynamically 
change according to the user-selected dropdown. The first threshold, which is red, is anything 
that is less than the yellow threshold value in cell F3. The yellow threshold is anything greater 
or equal to the yellow threshold value in cell F3 but less than the green threshold value in cell 
G3. The green threshold is anything that is greater than or equal to the green threshold value 
in cell G3. Using the range bound in the Alert Thresholds section, we can dynamically change 
our threshold settings.
There's more...
In this example, we hardcoded all the threshold and chart data values. But in reality, we can 
populate the values in the yellow destination cells of steps 3 and 4 using any of the available 
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards data connectivity options.

To use different data connectivity options, please read the recipes in Chapter 8, 
Dashboard Data Connectivity.
Displaying alerts on a map
A map on a dashboard allows us to visually identify how different regions are doing using a 
picture instead of a table or chart. With alerts on the map, we can provide even more value. 
For example, look at the following screenshot. We can see that different regions of the map 
can be colored differently depending on their value. This allows users to identify at a glance 
whether a region is doing well or poorly.

Using Alerts
152
Getting ready
Insert a Canadian map object into the canvas and bind data to the map. We will use the same 
example from the Using maps to select data of an area or country recipe in Chapter 3, From a 
Static to an Interactive Dashboard.
You may also refer to the data prepared in the source file, Displaying 
alerts on a map.xlf.
How to do it...
1.	 In a separate area of the spreadsheet (highlighted in yellow), set up the threshold 
values. Assume that all provinces have the same threshold.

Chapter 5
153
2.	 Go to the Alerts section of the map properties and check Enable Alerts.
3.	 Select the radio button By Value.
4.	 In the Alert Thresholds section, check Use a Range. Then, bind the range to the 
Threshold dataset in step 1.
5.	 In the Color Order section, select the radio button High values are good.

Using Alerts
154
How it works...
In this recipe, we show how to set up alerting for a map component. The way we set it up is 
pretty standard from steps 2 through 5. Once the alerting mechanism is set up, each province 
in the map will have its value associated with the alert threshold that we set up in step 1. The 
province will be colored red if the sales value is less than the yellow threshold. The province 
will be colored yellow if the sales value is greater than or equal to the yellow threshold but less 
than the green threshold. The province will be colored green if the sales value is greater than 
or equal to the green threshold.
There's more...
In our example, we assumed that all the provinces have the same threshold. There is also 
a way to set up alerts so that each province can have its own threshold. The next recipe, 
Displaying alerts of different thresholds on a map, will explain how to accomplish this. We 
can also use the CMaps plugin found in the Integrating Google Maps with the CMaps plugin 
recipe in Chapter 10, Top Third-party Add-ons, to accomplish the same task, but in a more 
flexible fashion.
Displaying alerts of different thresholds 
on a map
The previous recipe was a very useful demonstration of how to set up alerts on a Map 
component. However, the threshold values of all provinces were the same. In reality, this may 
not be the case for metrics such as sales. For example, a province such as Nunavut is much 
smaller than Ontario, and thus should not have the same sales threshold as Ontario.

Chapter 5
155
Getting ready
Insert a Canada by province component into the canvas and bind data to the map. We will 
use the data setup from the Displaying alerts on a map recipe to select the data of an area 
or country.
Please refer to the first screenshot in the introductory section of the recipe 
Making alert ranges dynamic to understand how the data should look.
You may also refer to the data setup in the source file, Displaying 
alerts of different thresholds.xlf.
How to do it...
1.	 To the right-hand side of the Sales column (column B), add the target thresholds for 
each province. The larger provinces will have a target threshold of 250, whereas the 
smaller provinces will have a target threshold of 150. It is important that you use the 
key-value relationship for the thresholds, as shown in the following screenshot, for 
the Map component:
2.	 Go to the Alerts section of the map properties and check Enable Alerts.
3.	 Select the radio button As Percent of Target and bind it to the key-value pair 
cells C2:D14.

Using Alerts
156
4.	 For the target percentage, color anything on the target or above as green. Color 
anything between 70% of target and the target as yellow. And color anything less 
than 70% of the target as red.
How it works...
Using the As Percent of Target option on Enable Alerts allows us to have a different 
threshold for each province, which gives a more realistic alerting mechanism.
It is important to use a key-value pair relationship when using the As 
Percent of Target alerting mechanism on a Maps component. For alerting 
on the Charts components, you don't have to worry about the key-value pair 
relationship.

In this recipe, we reused the data setup from the Using maps to select data of an area or 
country recipe of Chapter 3, From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard.
Using bindable colors to control alert 
coloring from a central location
With the advent of the option to dynamically bind colors to different parts of a component, we 
can push alerting to another level. For example, we may have a sales chart for a set of regions 
and may want to signal whether something is critically wrong. Instead of having a bunch of 
green and red bars that may look like a Christmas tree, we can set the chart background color 
to red if one of the values has reached a critical point. In this scenario, a user will be drawn to 
the chart right away, as it will be ringing alarm bells.
Getting ready
Be sure to have your chart data ready, shown as follows. In this recipe, we will have a set of 
sales data for each region. You may use the setup from the previous recipe, Adding alerts 
to a column chart, to help save you time.

Using Alerts
158
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Column Chart from the Charts section of the Components window onto 
the canvas.
2.	 Bind the chart data to the data set up in the Getting ready section.
3.	 Create a section in the worksheet that will contain the critical threshold value. If any 
region sales go below that value, we want a major alert to show up.
 

Chapter 5
159
4.	 Bind cell F5, which determines the background color, to the Background Color 
property of the chart.
How it works...
Using bindable colors, we can dynamically set color properties for almost any component. 
In our example, we use a simple COUNTIF statement to determine whether any of the 
region sales are below the critical threshold. From there, we have another IF statement that 
determines the coloring of the chart background. The first case (the left-hand side graph in 
the following screenshot) shows that all our sales are above $200; thus, the chart background 
is white. The second case (the right-hand side graph in the following screenshot) shows that 
the sales in the West region are below $200; thus, a major alert is shown and the chart 
background becomes red.

There are many ways to customize alerting for different components. Our example only 
shows one way to do so. The easiest way can be found in the Adding alerts to a column chart 
recipe. To learn more about customizing charts to your desired look and feel, read the recipes 
in Chapter 7, Dashboard Look and Feel.

Using Alerts
160
Using alerts in a Scorecard
With the Scorecard component, we can easily create scorecard KPIs with the ability to insert 
a user-desired alert / trending icon in any column of the scorecard.
In this recipe, we will go through an example of using the Scorecard component to show a 
table of values, a threshold indicator that will determine whether the current month's sales 
meet the threshold or not, and a trend indicator that shows whether the current month's sales 
have risen/fallen compared to the previous month's sales.
Getting ready
Set up your data as follows. We have a list of regions, current month sales, previous month 
sales, and sales threshold. Note that the Month to Month Change column is highlighted 
because it can either come from the external data source or it could be calculated in the 
Excel spreadsheet.

Chapter 5
161
How to do it...
1.	 Select the Scorecard selector from the Selectors category of the Components 
window and drag it onto the canvas.
2.	 Bind the Scorecard component to the spreadsheet data prepared in the 
Getting ready section.

Using Alerts
162
3.	 Now set up the alert components. First, set up a calculation in column F of the 
spreadsheet, which will determine whether the threshold indicator for the current 
month will be green or red. Use the incremental formula, =IF(B2 >= E2, 1, -1), 
in each row in column F.
4.	 Go to the Alerts section of the scorecard properties and check the Current Month 
Sales checkbox.
5.	 Bind Alert Values to cells F2:F5.
6.	 Select By Value, right below the Alert Values section.
7.	
In the Alert Thresholds section, delete the yellow color by clicking on the X button in 
the second last column.

Chapter 5
163
8.	 In the Alert Thresholds section, go to the To value of the first row and change it to 0.
9.	 In the Color Order section, select the High values are good radio button.
10.	 In the Alerts section of the scorecard properties, check the Month to Month 
Change checkbox.
11.	 Bind Alert Values to cells D2:D5.
12.	Select By Value, right below the Alert Values section.

Using Alerts
164
13.	Set Alert Threshold values to what is shown in the following screenshot. The 
numbers will be explained in the How it works... section.
14.	 Click on the highlighted icon in the Enable Auto Colors section and select the arrow 
icons circled in red.
15.	In the Color Order section, select the High values are good radio button.

Chapter 5
165
16.	 Go to the Appearance section of the Scorecard component. Select the Text tab. 
Uncheck the Month to Month Change checkbox because we only want to see the 
trending icon here and not the text.
How it works...
In the Scorecard component, we can combine different types of alerts together with our table 
data, as shown in the following screenshot. Now, let's discuss some important points from the 
steps in the How to do it… section.
In step 2, you will notice that we do not bind to the Sales Threshold column because that 
column is used to calculate whether the Current Month Sales are above or below the Sales 
Threshold. As you can see in step 3, we have column F that houses the calculation. The 
calculated values in column F are then bound as the alert values in step 5. From there, 
we are able to determine whether the threshold indicator on the Current Month Sales 
column should be green or red.

Using Alerts
166
The trend icons shown in the Month to Month Change column are determined from the 
values in the Month to Month Change column. In step 13, you will notice the funny 0.00001 
values. This is to take into account Month to Month Change values that are 0. Unfortunately, 
we cannot set (if value = 0, then show no change arrow), so 0.00001 is the next closest 
alternative. In the Month to Month Change column, we want to show the arrows, so in step 
16, we hide the text values.

Introduction
In the previous chapters, we discussed the functionality and applicability of a lot of SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboard components. In this chapter, we will be looking at a number of 
components that have a somewhat unique, non-standard functionality, but that may deliver 
great added value to your dashboards.
Printing your dashboard
The Print button has a single and pretty straightforward functionality: it will print 
your dashboard.
6

Advanced Components
168
Getting ready
You can use any dashboard you created earlier or just open a new blank dashboard file.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Print button component into the canvas:
2.	 Go to the Behavior tab and select Scale to.
3.	 Set the scale to 70%:
4.	 Try the Print button by previewing the dashboard.
How it works...
After clicking on the Print button, you will see a standard Windows Print window, where you 
can select and configure a printer, and set the number of copies to be printed.
As we can see, the only specific settings for this component were the Print Scale option. The 
default Scale to fit page option makes sure that the dashboard fits on a single page. If you 
select the other option and scale the dashboard to a certain percentage, it might be using 
more than one page to be printed on.
Although the Print button will appear in the dashboard, it will not appear on 
the printed result!

Third-party Add-ons to learn about a third-party printing solution for SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards that offers more features than the Print button component.

Chapter 6
169
Grouping and organizing components with 
the Canvas Container
In the Grouping the canvas components recipe in Chapter 1, Staying in Control, we 
discussed how grouping multiple components works. This solution is a good option when 
a limited number of components are involved. But if you are building a dashboard with a 
lot of overlapping layers in combination with the Dynamic Visibility functionality, you are 
recommended to use the Canvas Container component.
Getting ready
No preparation is required. Just open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboard file.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Canvas Container component found in the Containers category into 
the canvas.
2.	 Resize the Canvas Container component to almost half the same size of the canvas.
3.	 Drag a Line Chart component directly into the Canvas Container:

Advanced Components
170
4.	 Take a look at the Object Browser. You will notice that the Line Chart component 
is placed one level below the Canvas Container component. This indicates that the 
Line Chart component is now part of Canvas Container:
5.	 Select Canvas Container and drag it to the far right of the canvas. As you will see, the 
Line Chart component also moves along with Canvas Container.
6.	 Now drag a Pie Chart component directly into Canvas Container.
7.	
Resize the Canvas Container so that only one chart remains fully visible. A scroll bar 
will show up on the right side of the Canvas Container component:
8.	 Preview the dashboard and check out how this looks in runtime.

Chapter 6
171
How it works...
The Canvas Container component looks a lot like the grouping of multiple components as 
we saw earlier in the recipe in Chapter 1, Staying in Control called Grouping the canvas 
components. But with this component, we also have the option to include horizontal or 
vertical scroll bars. In the properties pane, you can determine whether the Canvas Container 
will show these scroll bars or not. By default, the Auto option is selected, which means that 
scroll bars are only shown if a component that is part of the Canvas Container component 
lies (partly) outside Canvas Container. This was explained in step 7 of this recipe.
The gray background of Canvas Container is only shown in design mode. If you run the 
dashboard, only the possible scroll bars are visible. In addition, one of the biggest benefits of 
using Canvas Container is that you do not have to ungroup the components when you want to 
resize or move the grouped components around.
Using dashboard scenarios
If your dashboard has a typical what-if scenario setup with a number of variables, it would be 
a nice option for the dashboard user to save a scenario with some particular settings to be 
reviewed or compared later. The Local Scenario Button component delivers this functionality.
Getting ready
Create a new dashboard file.

Advanced Components
172
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Vertical Slider component into the canvas.
2.	 Drag a Local Scenario Button component from the Other category into the canvas.
3.	 Hit the Preview button.
4.	 Set the slider value to 50.
5.	 Now click on the Scenario button. A menu with four new buttons will appear. Click on 
the Save button and name it Scenario 1 as shown in the following screenshot:
6.	 Set the slider to value 75 and click on the Scenario button again.
7.	
Click on the Load button and select the scenario you just saved. The value of the 
slider will now be set to 50.
How it works...
The Local Scenario Button component enables the user of a dashboard to save the 
exact state a dashboard is in at that moment, including all the variables the user has set. 
These scenarios are saved locally on the user's computer. This means that if you open the 
dashboard on another computer these saved scenarios cannot be loaded!
With the Delete button, the user can delete previously saved scenarios and with the 
Set Default button, a default scenario can be chosen, which will be loaded when the 
dashboard is opened.
There's more...
If the dashboard user wants to return to the initial state of the dashboard, they can close the 
dashboard and reopen it. Using the Reset button component for this task is a better option. 
The Reset button does exactly what its name says; it resets the entire dashboard to its initial 
state when clicked upon:

Chapter 6
173
Using the Grid component
The Grid component can display a table with data in your dashboard. Therefore, it looks a bit 
like the List View and Spreadsheet Table components. There are a number of differences 
between these two sets of components, stated as follows:
f
f
The List View and Spreadsheet Table components allow us to make data selections; 
the Grid component does not
f
f
The Grid component not only displays data, but its values can also be changed by the 
dashboard user
f
f
The Grid component doesn't have a header row
Getting ready
Open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file and enter the values in the spreadsheet as 
shown in the following screenshot:
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Grid component into the canvas.
2.	 Bind the Data field to spreadsheet cells A5 until C7.
3.	 Go the Behavior tab and set Increment to 5.
4.	 Click on the Appearance tab. Set the Vertical Margin as well as the Horizontal 
Margin to 5.
5.	 Resize the Canvas Container component to almost half the size of the canvas.

Advanced Components
174
6.	 Preview the dashboard to see how this works. Move your mouse over one of the cells 
and click on it as soon as the cursor changes into an up down arrow as shown in 
the following screenshot. Now drag your cursor up or down to change the value of 
the cell.
This only works when the data bound to the Grid component is static. 
When it is formula-based this will not work.
How it works...
As you can see, the way the Grid component works is quite straightforward. It displays a 
simple table with the values in the spreadsheet cells we bound to the component. The value 
of each cell can then be adjusted when we run the dashboard. As with all the insertion-like 
components, the actual value in the spreadsheet cell will change as well and can be used in 
Excel functions or other components that refer to this cell.
There's more...
In the General tab, we can set the Minimum Limit and Maximum Limit fields that we can 
change a value to. This means that if the initial value of a cell lies outside this range and you 
want to change the value, you can only change it to a value within the range.
Under the Common sub-tab of the Behavior tab, these limits can be set to Fixed or Open. If 
you choose the Open option, the Scale fields on the General tab are grayed out.

Chapter 6
175
Furthermore, you can set the Mouse Sensitivity level. This will set the speed in which the 
values will increase or decrease when changing them. If you set Scroll Behavior to Auto, the 
values keep changing if you click the cell and drag the cursor a bit above or below the cell. 
If you use the Manual option instead, you have to keep moving your cursor up or down to 
change the value.
Creating a slideshow
As we already discussed in the Making selections from a custom image (the push button 
and image component) recipe in Chapter 3, From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard, you 
can use the image component to show pictures or Flash (.swf) files in your dashboard. This 
recipe will show how you can create slideshows of multiple images and/or SWF files with the 
Slide Show component.
Getting ready
For this recipe, we need some images and/or SWF files. Make sure that these are files of 
the following types: .jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp, or .swf. The files can reside on your local 
computer or on the Web.

Advanced Components
176
How to do it...
1.	 Enter the URLs of the images or SWF files you want to show in the spreadsheet:
2.	 Drag a Play Selector component into the canvas. Set the component to insert rows 
to Destination cell A4. The Source field will be bound to the URL cells A5 to A8. For 
more information on this component, see the Using the Play Selector / Play Control 
component recipe in Chapter 3, From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard.
3.	 Now drag a Slide Show component into the canvas.
4.	 Bind the URL field to cell A4.
5.	 Switch to the Behavior tab and set Transition Type to Wedge.
6.	 Preview the dashboard to see how the Slide Show looks.
How it works...
The Play Selector component does most of the work here actually. We need it to change 
the image that should be displayed by using data insertion. The slide show component only 
displays the images and provides a nice transition between two images.

Chapter 6
177
There's more...
In the Appearance tab, there are some options that are specific to this component. First 
is Sizing Method, where you can set how the image or the SWF file should be displayed: in 
its original size, in scale, or stretched to the size of the component. Next, there are settings 
for Horizontal Alignment and Vertical Alignment. Besides these options the standard 
Transparency option is also available:
Using the Panel Set component
The Panel Set component is one of the few features of SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 
that looks really cool at first, but is something you most likely won't use. The purpose of this 
component is to create a showcase of images and/or Flash (.swf) files in one window. The 
user is able to zoom in on each panel. Unfortunately, the SWF files that are created with SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards are not supported and cannot be displayed, which instantly 
decreases the value of the component.
Getting ready
For this recipe, we need some images and/or SWF files. Make sure these files are of the 
following types: .jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp, or .swf.

Advanced Components
178
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Panel Set component into the canvas.
2.	 In the General tab of the properties pane, select Layout2:
3.	 Click on the Import button in the Content area and click on the Click to Add Images 
button in the upcoming window. Browse to your image or SWF file and click on Open. 
The file is now added to Panel 1. Repeat this step to add another file and close this 
window by clicking on OK:
4.	 Click on the button on the far right-hand side of the Drop-Down Menu Labels field. 
Enter a label for each file you just added:

Chapter 6
179
5.	 Select Panel 2 and repeat steps 3 and 4 to add some images and/or SWF files to this 
second panel.
6.	 Now switch to the Behavior tab. In the Selected Item area, select Panel 1 and set 
the Item field to Image 1. Do the same for Panel 2:
7.	
Preview the dashboard.
8.	 Click on the maximize buttons:

Advanced Components
180
9.	 Now click on the little arrow next to the maximize button to show the menu labels. 
Select a label to switch to another image or SWF file:
How it works...
As we saw in this recipe, the Panel Set component lets us display a set of panels to show 
multiple images and/or SWF files. There are even 27 different layouts to choose from with 
up to 10 panels each.
The lack of support for SAP BusinessObjects Dashboard SWF files has already been 
mentioned, but there are more problems with this component. First, it does not have any 
selector capabilities, so even if you want to use this component to build a dashboard, it only 
functions as a sort of product catalog. It is very difficult to make it interactive and let it pass 
data through to other components.
Another problem is performance-related. The more (high-resolution) images you embed in 
the component, the bigger your final dashboard SWF file will become. Big SWF files take 
longer to load and therefore decrease your dashboard's performance. So if you are using this 
component, make sure you test your final dashboard on different computer setups to check 
whether the dashboard's performance is acceptable for users.
There's more...
In the following sections, there are some additional features that are available with the Panel 
Set component.

Chapter 6
181
Linking to files instead of embedding
In the recipe, we embedded the images/SWFs in the Panel Set component. Another way to 
show these files is by using the By URL option for Content Type and linking to them using 
URLs. You can enter these URLs by putting them in the spreadsheet and binding to these 
cells. Or, you can add them as labels by clicking on the button on the far right-hand side. 
The Drop-Down Menu Labels field can be entered in the same way:
Panel behavior
A nice option for this component is the Zoom Speed setting. Play around a bit with this slider 
to make the panel transition as smooth as you want it to be. Also, here you can enable/
disable the maximize button:
Using the History component
The History component makes it possible to plot a value in a chart that changes in real time, 
while preserving its historical data. If that sounds confusing, think about the stock market 
charts that track the fluctuation of a stock price. At the start of the day, the line in such a 
chart is short, while at the end of the day the complete trend of the stock price for that day is 
shown. This recipe will show you how to set up this kind of functionality in your dashboard.

Advanced Components
182
Getting ready
Just open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Line Chart component, History component from the Other category, and a 
Horizontal Slider component into the canvas.
2.	 Select the Horizontal Slider component and bind the Data field to the spreadsheet 
cell B1.
3.	 Now select the History component and bind its Data field to the spreadsheet 
cell B1.
4.	 Bind the Data Destination field to the spreadsheet range B3:J3.
5.	 Go to the Line Chart component. Bind the Data | By Range field to the spreadsheet 
range B3:J3.
6.	 Your setup should now look like what is shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 6
183
7.	
Hit the Preview button and test the dashboard. Each time you move the slider, a new 
value should be plotted in the chart:
How it works...
The History component picks up a value from a certain source cell (cell B1 in this recipe) and 
pastes it in a horizontal or vertical range of cells, which in fact store the history of the value. 
These cells are bound to a chart and so a real-time changing graph is created.
The History component has, besides binding to the source and destination cells, only one 
other setting. You can determine when a value should be pasted to the destination cells. This 
can be either when the data changes or on an interval of a certain number of seconds. This 
component works in the background and will therefore not be shown during runtime.
There's more...
If you need more series of real-time changing values in your chart, just use more History 
components to accomplish this.
Another important feature is that in some cases, we can use the History component to 
remember values from a query so that we can avoid re-running queries when we need 
to look at past data from past queries.

Advanced Components
184
Inserting data with the Source Data 
component
The Source Data component enables us to insert data into spreadsheet cells by changing the 
selected index value of the component. This is a different approach to inserting data than the 
one we saw in Chapter 3, From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard, when we were discussing 
selectors and drilldowns.
Getting ready
Open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboard file and enter the following data into the 
spreadsheet:
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Pie Chart component into the canvas.
2.	 Bind the Chart field to cell B3 and leave the Subtitle field empty.
3.	 Bind the Data | Values field to the spreadsheet range from C3 to E3. Select the Data 
in Rows option.
4.	 Bind the Labels field to cells C5 to E5.
5.	 Drag a Horizontal Slider component to the canvas.
6.	 Bind the Data field to cell B1.
7.	
Set Minimum Limit to 0 and Maximum Limit to 3.

Chapter 6
185
8.	 Now drag the Source Data component into the canvas:
9.	 Set Insertion Type as Row.
10.	 Bind the Source Data field to cell range B6:E9.
11.	 Bind the Destination field to cells B3:E3:
12.	Go to the Behavior tab. Bind the Selected Item Index field to cell B1:

Advanced Components
186
13.	Preview the dashboard:
How it works...
As mentioned in the introduction of this recipe, the Source Data component has the same 
data insertion functionality as selector components and drilldowns from charts. But, the data 
insertion of the Source Data component is triggered by a changing value in a spreadsheet cell 
and not directly by a user interacting with a component.
In this recipe, we used the Horizontal Slider component to change a cell value (cell B1) to 
trigger the data insertion. But you can, of course, also use this component in combination 
with Excel formulas, Dynamic Visibility, or the data inserted by other components.
Analyzing trends
Using the Trend Analyzer component, you can calculate trends in a series of data. You can 
then display these trends in a chart so that you can view them next to the actual data and 
make your analysis. This component can also forecast future trends based on actual data.
Getting ready
For this recipe, we need some data, so open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file and 
enter the values in the spreadsheet as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 6
187
How to do it...
1.	 Drag a Combination Chart component into the canvas.
2.	 Bind the data By Range to the spreadsheet cells A5:O7.
3.	 Drag a Trend Analyzer component from the Other category into the canvas.
4.	 Bind the Data field to cells A6:L6.
5.	 Set Trend/Regression Type as Linear.
6.	 Bind the Analyzed Data Destination field to cells A7:O7.
7.	
Set Number of Forecast Periods to 3:

Advanced Components
188
8.	 Now preview the dashboard:
How it works...
In the previous example, we created a chart that shows a data series over a 12-month period. 
We selected Linear trend type, so the Trend Analyzer component calculates a linear trend 
based on all the 12 values. Also, a forecast is calculated for the three months we didn't have 
data for. The combination chart visualizes both the actual and the calculated trend data 
series, where the latter is a straight line. As the Trend Analyzer component is a background 
component, it won't be shown during runtime.
Besides the Linear option for Trend/Regression Type, we can choose Logarithmic, 
Polynomial, Power, or Exponential. Also, we can use the Best Fit option and trust SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards to choose the correct one for us.
There's more...
The properties pane of the Trend Analyzer component has a More Options section. Here 
you can bind information about the chosen Trend/Regression Type to the spreadsheet cells 
and display them in your dashboard. The fields you can show are Equation Type Destination, 
Equation Destination (that's the equation), R2 Value Destination, and F Value Destination:

Introduction
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards provides a powerful way to capture the audience by allowing 
developers to build dashboards with the important wow factor. When a dashboard is visually 
striking, the user will be more engaged and will thus make better use of it. Poor dashboard 
design can frustrate users, causing them to quickly give up on getting what they need out of 
the dashboard, even if it has all the information and functionality that they desire.

Changing the look of a chart
This recipe will explain how to change the look of a chart. Particularly, it will go through each 
tab in the appearance icon of the chart properties. We will then make modifications and see 
the resulting changes.
Getting ready
Insert a chart object into the canvas. Prepare some data and bind it to the chart.
How to do it...
1.	 Click on the chart object on the canvas/object properties window to go 
to chart properties.
2.	 In the Layout tab, uncheck Show Chart Background.
3.	 In the Series tab, click on the colored box under Fill to change the color of the bar 
to your desired color.

Chapter 7
191
4.	 Then change the width of each bar; click on the Marker Size area and change 
it to 35.
5.	 Click on the colored boxes circled in red in the Axes tab and choose dark blue as the 
Line Color for the horizontal and vertical axes separately.
6.	 Uncheck Show Minor Gridlines to remove all the horizontal lines in between each of 
the major gridlines.

Dashboard Look and Feel

7.	
Next, go to the Text and Color tabs, where you can make changes to all the different 
text areas of the chart, as shown in the following screenshot:
How it works...
As you can see, the default chart looks plain and the bars are skinny so it's harder to visualize 
things. It is a good idea to remove the chart background if there is one so that the chart 
blends in better. In addition, the changes to the chart colors and text provide additional 
aesthetics that help improve the look of the chart.
Adding a background to your dashboard
This recipe shows the usefulness of backgrounds in the dashboard. It will show how 
backgrounds can help provide additional depth to objects and help to group certain 
areas together for better visualization.
Getting ready
Make sure you have all your objects such as charts and selectors ready on the canvas. The 
following is an example of the two charts before the makeover. Bind some data to the 
charts if you want to change the coloring of the series.

How to do it...
1.	 Choose Background4 from the Art and Backgrounds tab of the Components window.
2.	 Stretch the background so that it fills the size of the canvas.
3.	 Make sure that the ordering of the backgrounds is behind the charts. To change the 
ordering of the background, go to the object browser, select the background object, 
and then press the - key until the background object is behind the chart.

4.	 Select Background from the Art and Backgrounds tab and put two of them under 
the charts, as shown in the following screenshot:
5.	 When the backgrounds are in place, open the properties window for the backgrounds 
and set the background color to your desired color. In this example, we chose dark 
grey and light grey for each background.
How it works...
As you can see with the before and after pictures, having backgrounds can make a huge 
difference in terms of aesthetics. The objects are much more pleasant to look at now and 
there is certainly a lot of depth in the charts.
The best way to choose the right backgrounds that fit your dashboard is to play around with 
the different background objects and their colors. If you are not very artistic, you can come up 
with a bunch of examples and demonstrate them to the business users to see which one they 
prefer the most.
There's more...
It is important to use backgrounds carefully and not to use them in the wrong places. A good 
reference that we recommend is the book Information Dashboard Design: Displaying data for 
at-a-glance monitoring, Stephen Few, Analytics Press. This is a great book that will guide you 
on the best dashboard design practices and on when to use backgrounds.

Using color schemes
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards conveniently has a set of built-in color themes that 
developers can use to instantly change the look of their dashboard. Using color themes 
helps provide consistent coloring among your objects and allows you to change the colors 
of multiple objects at a time, without having to go into the properties of each object to make 
any color changes.
Getting ready
Have a set of objects ready on the canvas that you want to make color changes to. In this 
example, we have the sales by region chart, a pie chart, and a set of backgrounds.
How to do it...
1.	 Click on the Colors icon and make sure that Current Theme Colors is selected under 
the Built-in section. The backgrounds will be grey and the charts bluish.

Dashboard Look and Feel
196
2.	 Click on the Colors icon again and select the Concourse color scheme.
How it works...
As you can see, the default color scheme initially looked kind of bland and the coloring for 
each series in the pie chart was very similar, making it tough to decipher between each of the 
series. Changing it to the Concourse color scheme lightens up the background considerably 
with a light blue background that is easy on the eyes. In addition, the series on the pie chart 
is more distinguishable; however, the blues in our opinion are still too similar. We can fix that 
by modifying the color scheme, which will be explained in the next recipe.
There's more...
Using a good coloring scheme requires a lot of trial and error and there are many best 
practices that need to be accounted for. For example, different series on a chart should 
be colored differently so that users don't have to spend a lot of time figuring out which bar 
belongs to which series.
We also want colors that are soothing to the eyes. Colors that are too bright or too dark may 
cause strain on the eyes, thus making it more difficult to find information.
When going through color schemes, it is best to show a demo to the end users who will be 
using the dashboard and go with a coloring scheme that is most comfortable to their eyes, 
as it will allow them to find information more easily.

Chapter 7
197
Sharing a color scheme
Developers may want to customize a dashboard's charts and objects to follow a company's 
coloring guidelines. Most likely, the company's coloring guidelines will not match any of the 
built-in color schemes, so we'll need a way to create one that we can reuse every time a new 
dashboard is built for the same company.
Getting ready
You must be able to view hidden files and folders in the c:\Documents and Settings\
your_user_id folder. If you are a Windows Vista or Windows 7 user, you must be able to 
view hidden files and folders in c:\Users\your_user_id.
How to do it...
1.	 Click on the Colors icon and select Create New Color Scheme at the bottom of 
the list.

Dashboard Look and Feel
198
2.	 Change the background color to whatever color you want from the Backgrounds tab 
in Advanced Settings as highlighted in the following screenshot:

Chapter 7
199
3.	 Click on the Charts tab and change the first Series color to something other than the 
default color. Also change the name of the Color Scheme to a name that you desire.
4.	 Click the Save button when you are finished.
5.	 Your color scheme has now been saved and you can now transfer it to other 
computers. Copy the XML files of the theme that you want to share from the following 
two folders to the exact same directory in the destination computer. The XML 
filenames will be named as you saved them, as follows:


c:\Documents and Settings\your_user_id\Application Data\
XcelsiuscustomThemes


c:\Documents and Settings\your_user_id\Application Data\
XcelsiuscustomThemesAutoInfo
6.	 For Windows Vista and Windows 7, the directory path for Xcelsius will be 
c:\Users\your_user_id\AppData\Roaming\.

Dashboard Look and Feel
200
How it works...
Every time you save a custom color scheme, it will create two XML files in the aforementioned 
directories. From there, you can easily share the color scheme with other developers or other 
machines that have SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards installed.
As you can see in the following screenshot, once you have the XML files of the color scheme 
in place, you will be able to select it from the Color Scheme Toolbar:
Working with themes
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards has a library of themes that developers can use to change 
chart and object styles to a look that suits them most. The ability to select different themes 
is important because it gives developers more options for customizing the look of their 
dashboards to what fits best. There are eight themes that developers can choose from. 
In this recipe, we will be showcasing the default theme along with two other themes.

Chapter 7
201
How to do it...
1.	 Click on the Themes icon and you will see that Aqua is selected by default.
2.	 Try out other themes such as Aero, Halo, and so on.
How it works...
As you can see, SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards provides a large library of themes, 
allowing you to customize the style of your backgrounds, objects, and charts. For example, 
some themes may have more gradient backgrounds and charts such as the Aero theme, 
whereas the Halo theme has a flat but bold look.
Note that some themes have more types of components than others. For 
example, the Aqua theme has more background components than the 
Admiral theme.

202
Making component colors dynamic
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards allows users to fully control the coloring of their 
components based on whatever event they desire. For example, if a major alert were to 
occur we would be able to dynamically change our background to red in order to signal an 
emergency. This is extremely useful because developers can not only dynamically control the 
color of bars on a chart but also the rest of the chart components such as the background 
and text as well.
How to do it...
1.	 Take a look at the following screenshot. In cell E2 (highlighted in yellow), we have a 
COUNTIF statement that will set the bar color to red if any of the regions have sold a 
number of items less than 40, or blue otherwise.

Chapter 7
203
2.	 In the chart properties, go to the Color tab and click on the square colored box in the 
Fill column. At the bottom of the color palette, choose the Bind to a Color option and 
bind to the cell with the color control (E2, in our case).

Dashboard Look and Feel
204
3.	 Go to the Text tab of the chart properties and click on the color square of the Chart 
Title. Bind the color to the cell that controls the title text color (in our case, E3).
4.	 Change the cells B2:B5 to a value below 40 and verify that the Bar color and 
Title color are functioning correctly.

Chapter 7
205
How it works...
As seen in our example, we can easily control the coloring of our chart components with 
the help of some Excel formulas. Using this method, we are able to alert users if something 
significant has occurred. For example, if it is critical that all of the regions surpass a sales 
threshold of 40 units, we can send out an alert signal (red title and bars) if one of the 
regions fails.
There's more...
Because the dynamic coloring depends on Boolean logic, you'll need the aid of Excel formulas 
to determine which color is displayed. We recommend that you become familiar with Excel 
Boolean logic to fully utilize the functionality of dynamic coloring.
Dynamic XY positioning and sizing of 
components
The ability to move components around dynamically as well as changing their size is a useful 
feature new to SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 4.1. For example, there may be a case 
where the placement of a chart is different depending on user selection. Instead of having 
to duplicate the chart, you can change its XY positioning.
Although dynamic XY positioning and sizing is a great feature, not all 
components support this. There is a trick that we will show you so that you 
can take advantage of dynamic XY positioning. However, it will not work for 
dynamic sizing.

Getting ready
Our example will consist of a Image Component that supports both dynamic XY positioning 
and sizing, as well as four sliders that can reposition and resize the component.

Chapter 7
207
How to do it…
1.	 For the component that you want to reposition and resize, bind the XY axis as well as 
the width/height to the appropriate Excel cells.
2.	 Bind the data output from each slider to the appropriate Excel cell.

Dashboard Look and Feel
208
3.	 Set the minimum and maximum values of the sliders to whatever values suit 
your range.
4.	 Preview the dashboard and you will see that as you move the sliders around, the 
component will reposition or resize appropriately.
There's more…
As mentioned earlier, not all components support dynamic XY repositioning and sizing. For the 
components that do not support this feature, we can still enable dynamic XY repositioning.

Chapter 7
209
All you need to do is put the component inside a Canvas Container and then control the XY 
positioning from the Canvas Container, as shown in the following screenshot:
You'll notice that the component(s) will move along with the Canvas Container.
Note that resizing an image to a larger size may deteriorate the quality 
of the image.

Dashboard Look and Feel

Using the Panel Container
The Panel Container component is useful if a designer thinks that a set of item(s) is too large 
for the canvas and wants to be able to scroll the inside of the canvas. A good example would 
be a scrolling set of charts. Let's say real estate on the dashboard is an issue and we have 
many charts that need to be shown, but it is not mandatory to show all charts in one view. If 
we put them in a Panel Container, we can scroll through each chart, similar to a slideshow.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the Panel Container from the Containers tab.
2.	 Insert a set of charts (these can be any type of charts that you wish to insert) inside 
the Panel Container.

Chapter 7
211
3.	 Shrink the Panel Container so that it doesn't take up too much real estate on the 
dashboard. You can do this by taking your mouse to the edge of the panel and 
resizing from there.
How it works...
In our example, we were able to emulate a slideshow of charts. This is useful if all the charts 
do not need to be visible in one screen, and will allow designers to save on real estate.
There's more...
If you are inserting multiple objects in a Panel Container you must make sure that the 
business is okay with the scrolling. In the majority of cases, it is a best practice to show 
everything on the same screen without having to scroll. In some cases, such large tables with 
many columns of information, we may have to resort to using the Panel Container in order to 
facilitate the best use of the real estate.
Using the Tab Set container
The best analogy to a Tab Set would be the tabs that you see in Internet Explorer and Mozilla 
Firefox. Before the advent of tabs, we would have multiple windows of Internet Explorer open, 
which was very cumbersome. With tabs we can flip through the different pages that we have 
opened very easily. With the Tab Set container, we can separate different pages within the 
dashboard. This allows us to flip through pages that are independent of each other but related 
to the same topic, without having to reload separate dashboards or set dynamic visibility for 
each page.

Dashboard Look and Feel
212
How to do it...
1.	 Select the Tab Set container from the Containers tab.
2.	 In the Properties window of the canvas, you can rename the tab. In our example we 
named the first tab as Sales.
3.	 To add a new tab, press the + button on the top left-hand side of the canvas. It will 
then pop up a window that lets you name your tab. In our example, we named the 
second tab Trend Analysis, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 7
213
4.	 Each tab is separated into a different canvas in the Object Browser window. All 
components residing in each canvas will show up as child objects of the canvas.
How it works...
The Tab Set container is basically a set of Canvas Containers that hold your objects. The set 
of Canvas Containers is distinguished by the tab at the top of the main container. Users can 
switch through tabs at runtime very easily. This functionality emulates the tabs found on 
popular browsers such as Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox.
There's more...
When building Tab Set containers, designers should be wary of having too many tabs or too 
many levels of tab hierarchies. It is recommended to keep the number of tabs in each level to 
a maximum of five.

Dashboard Look and Feel
214
Take the following image for example. With nine tabs, we can see that the dashboard starts 
to become overwhelming and complex. It is also good to keep the number of hierarchies to a 
maximum of two. Again, we can see that once we get past two hierarchies, it starts to become 
messy and users will have too many paths to choose from.
Finally, each additional tab means an additional page. With each additional page comes a 
set of components and charts, which equate to a larger footprint. Dashboards with a larger 
footprint will take longer to load due to the size of the SWF file and performance will take 
a hit due to the number of objects.
Although the Tab Set container is a useful tool, in terms of performance, it is 
best to create a tab panel by using the Label Based Menu and then simply 
use Dynamic Visibility. Instructions can be found in Chapter 3, From a Static 
to an Interactive Dashboard and Chapter 4, Dynamic Visibility.
Making tables look pretty
With SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards, we can create tables that look just like a table in an 
Excel spreadsheet. Unfortunately, our everyday tables look quite bland. If we start off with a 
default spreadsheet table, it will look kind of like this:

Chapter 7
215
It looks okay, but with the help of some additional objects, we can spice it up to look a bit 
more attractive.
Getting ready
Prepare the data on your Excel spreadsheet and set up a Spreadsheet Table component as 
shown in the previous screenshot.
How to do it...
1.	 Add color to the row header, and make the header text bold.

Dashboard Look and Feel
216
2.	 In the Spreadsheet Table component properties, rebind Display Data to the 
corresponding cells (A1:F15) so that the updated header text format will show 
up. Go to the Appearance category and uncheck Show Gridlines.
3.	 Change the theme to Aero.
4.	 Select the first Background object from the Art and Backgrounds tab from the 
Category window. Place the background so that it is under the table.
5.	 Select Label from the Text tab of the Category window. Center it on the title 
background to give the table a title.
How it works...
As you can see, with the help of a couple of components, such as backgrounds and labels, 
we are able to spice up the look of a table.

The Adding a background to your dashboard recipe
Using quadrants smartly
It is very important when designing a dashboard to make it as easy to read as possible. In 
addition, we want to make a dashboard conform to how humans analyze a picture. A common 
concept is to move from the top left-hand side to the top right-hand side and then to the 
bottom. This is a flow that the majority of users are comfortable with.
Now we bring in the concept of quadrants. Quadrants allow us to create groupings so that a 
user is not overwhelmed when looking at a dashboard.
Getting ready
Gather the desired charts and selectors on your dashboard.
How to do it...
1.	 Set up your charts so that the dashboard is divided into four quadrants.

Dashboard Look and Feel
218
2.	 Selectors should be on the top left-hand side if they control the whole chart.
3.	 Use backgrounds to separate your quadrants.
4.	 Parent charts should be on the left-hand side or on top of the drilldown chart.
5.	 Charts that we want users to look at first should be at the top.
6.	 If possible, size all the quadrants equally.
7.	
Align the components neatly so that it is easier on the eyes when looking for 
different items.
How it works...
As you can see, when we group things into four quadrants, it is very easy to read the 
dashboard. In addition, we are comfortable with navigation as we start at the top left-hand 
side. The drilldown is easy to understand and navigate through as we have the parent chart 
on the left-hand side of the drilldown chart. Secondary information should be at the bottom 
of the chart and not at the top, as users are interested in the highest-level data first when 
viewing the dashboard. Finally, it is important to align everything neatly and size everything 
as equally as possible. This makes the dashboard much easier to read.
Now let's take an example of a dashboard that is not set in quadrants but is aligned neatly, 
as shown in the following screenshot:
This dashboard is harder to read and navigate now, as things are not in quadrants. The drop-
down selectors are on the bottom right-hand side, so we have to shift our focus to the main 
parent chart diagonally whenever we want to make a change, which is not very user friendly.

Creating/using a dashboard template
To ensure consistency among dashboards within an organization, it is good to create a 
dashboard template. This also saves time on having to redevelop recurring objects.
Getting ready
Set up a dashboard that contains components and colors that would be common among 
dashboards in the organization. In our example, we have a common background and color 
scheme, as shown in the following screenshot:

Dashboard Look and Feel

How to do it…
1.	 Go to File | Save as….
2.	 Browse to <Installation Path>\Xcelsius 4.0\assets\template.
3.	 Create a folder with a name or category of your choice.
4.	 Save the file with a filename of your choice.
5.	 Exit and reopen SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards.
6.	 Go to File | Templates… or press Ctrl + T.
7.	
Select the folder that you created from the category selection.
8.	 Select the dashboard that you saved earlier.
How it works…
As you can see, dashboard templates are stored in <Installation Path>\Xcelsius 
4.0\assets\template. Once you create a dashboard template, you can easily access it 
without having to remember the exact directory you have stored the template in.
There's more…
Unfortunately, this method works only on local machines unless there is a network shortcut 
at <Installation Path>\Xcelsius 4.0\assets\template directory. Because 
of this, it is quite cumbersome to set up; however, once set up, it works great.
An alternative is to create a dashboard template directory in a shared network area, then 
create a shortcut to that directory on your desktop. From there, you can then open the 
dashboard template and work on it.
It is important to note that if you use the method of storing the dashboard 
templates in a shared network directory, you'll need to make sure that the 
dashboard templates are read only; otherwise, you'll risk having the templates 
accidentally modified.

Introduction
Dashboards get really powerful when they are able to display recent or even real-time 
data. Of course, you can manually enter the updated data in the SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards spreadsheet and publish a new dashboard every time the data changes. 
If your dashboard uses a lot of data that changes regularly, you will quickly find out that 
this is a very time-consuming task.
A good solution is to set up one or more data connections between the dashboard and 
an external data source. If the data in the source changes, the dashboard will show this 
updated information.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
222
Creating a news ticker with Excel XML Maps
In this recipe, we will show you how to integrate a real-time news ticker into your dashboard. The 
user will then be able to click on a news article and the website will automatically pop up. To set 
up this connection to an online news website, we will use the Excel XML Maps connection.
Getting ready
Make sure the spreadsheet has a DEVELOPER tab, and that you are connected to the Internet.
If you do not see the DEVELOPER tab, please follow these instructions:
1.	 Click on FILE.
2.	 Click on Options.
3.	 Click on Customize Ribbon.
4.	 Check the DEVELOPER box.

How to do it...
1.	 Go to http://www.cnn.com/. At the bottom of this page, you will see an RSS link. 
You can also directly go to http://www.cnn.com/services/rss/.
2.	 Copy the URL of the Top Stories RSS feed: http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.
rss.
RSS is an XML-based method by which web content can be 
easily and quickly distributed when it is changed or newly 
entered into a website.
3.	 Open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file, go to the DEVELOPER tab, and 
click on Source. The XML Source pane will appear.
If you are using MS Excel 2003, you can find the XML Source 
pane at Data | XML | XML Source.
4.	 Click on the XML Maps... button.
5.	 In the upcoming XML Maps window, click on the Add... button.

6.	 Paste the RSS URL into the File name field and click on Open. A message might 
appear stating that this XML source does not refer to a schema and Excel will 
create one itself. Click on OK.
7.	
Click on OK once more in the XML Maps window to close it. The XML Source window 
will now show all the fields that are available in this RSS stream.
8.	 To create a news ticker we only need two of these fields: the title of the article and 
the URL to the article on the CNN website. Both fields are located in the item folder: 
title and link. Click and drag the title field to cell A6 and drag the link field to cell B6.
9.	 Hit the Refresh Data button in the DEVELOPER tab. The cells below A6 and B6 will 
now be filled with data from the RSS feed.

21.	 Finally, go to the Appearance tab and deselect the Show Button Background option. 
The URL Button component should now be invisible.
22.	Try your dashboard!
How it works...
Let's recap what we just did. First, we added an RSS feed from http://www.cnn.com/ 
to our spreadsheet. We used the standard Excel XML Maps functionality to do this. A big 
advantage of this method is that we can preview the data directly in the spreadsheet, which 
eases the setup of components and data bindings.
Next, we created a data connection in the Data Manager. This step is necessary to let SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards know where to get the data from and under what conditions 
(refresh rate). If we do not do this, the dashboard will not get fresh data from the RSS feed 
and will only use the data that is already stored in the spreadsheet cells.
We bound a Ticker component to the cells containing the titles of the news stories. If the user 
clicks one of the titles, a web page should open with the right story. We set up row insertion to 
fetch the right URL for the URL Button. Finally, we configured the URL Button component so it 
would be triggered without clicking it.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
228
There's more...
In this section, we will take a look at the Usage tab under Data Manager | Connections, 
as well as the Connection Refresh Button component.
Usage tab
Most connection types in the Data Manager have a Usage tab like we saw in step 13 of the 
recipe. There are two sections in this tab: Refresh Options and Load Status.
With Refresh Before Components Are Loaded the data connection will be used to get data 
as soon as the dashboard starts. The Refresh Every option sets the refresh rate in seconds, 
minutes, or hours. You can also choose to refresh the data when a value in a particular 
spreadsheet cell changes or a certain value is matched.
During the loading of fresh data it is possible to inform the dashboard user what is happening 
at the moment (loading data or idle). You can insert these messages in a spreadsheet cell 
and display them, for example, with a Label component. Also, a nice idea is to display a 
loading-image instead of text. You can use Dynamic Visibility to set this up (see Chapter 4, 
Dynamic Visibility).
If you select the Enable Load Cursor option, the cursor will change from the standard arrow 
into an hourglass. The Disable Mouse Input on Load option will disable user interactions 
(mouse clicks and mouseovers) as long as data is being loaded.

Chapter 8
229
Connection Refresh Button
To manually refresh data when using the dashboard, we can use the Connection Refresh 
Button component, which can be found under Web Connectivity. This component can 
refresh one or more connections that are defined in the Data Manager.
Using Query as a Web Service (QaaWS)
Query as a Web Service is a small but powerful tool in the SAP BusinessObjects BI portfolio. 
It allows us to create a query on top of a SAP BusinessObjects Universe and publish its results 
as a Web Service. This recipe shows you how to create a QaaWS and how to consume the 
data in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards.
Getting ready
First, you will need SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform to be installed on your machine (along 
with server and client components). You will also need a Universe that is connected to an 
underlying database.
How to do it...
1.	 Open Query as a Web Service and log in to your SAP BusinessObjects BI server. You 
can find this application in the SAP BusinessObjects BI 4 platform Client Tools folder.
2.	 Click the New Query button on the upper left. Here you can enter a name for this Web 
Service and a description (not mandatory). Enter a name for your Web Service and 
click the Next button.

Dashboard Data Connectivity

3.	 Select a Universe and click Next.
4.	 The following screen allows us to build our query. The left column contains the 
available dimensions, measures, and filters from the selected Universe. Drag the 
ones you want to use into the Result Objects window and click Next.

5.	 If the Answer prompts screen pops up, just click the OK button. The There's more... 
section of this recipe will discuss the use of prompts.
6.	 The Preview screen provides us with an overview of the QaaWS setup we just 
created. The most important part of the Preview screen is that it shows how the 
data and its layout will look in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards after setting up 
the data connection and binding the columns to the spreadsheet. When you are 
satisfied with the preview, you can click on Publish.
7.	
Now click the To Clipboard button to copy the Web Service URL to your clipboard.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
232
8.	 In SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards open the Data Manager window.
9.	 Add a Web service query (Query as a Web Service) connection.
10.	 Paste the URL into the WSDL URL field and click Import.
11.	 Select the row folder in the Output Values section. Since we have three columns 
of data in this Web Service, we have to bind it to a three-column area in the 
spreadsheet. Bind it to cells A6:C30.
12.	Go to the Usage tab and select Refresh Before Components Are Loaded. 
Close the Data Manager.
13.	To see if and how the data is fetched by SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards from 
the Web Service, add a Spreadsheet Table component to the canvas and bind it 
to cells A6:C30.
14.	 Preview the dashboard. A User Identification popup will appear. Enter your 
SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform credentials to log in. The Spreadsheet Table 
component will now be filled with data from the Web Service.

How it works...
In this recipe, we used three stages to get data into our dashboard. First, the SAP 
BusinessObjects Universe; second, the QaaWS definition on top of the Universe that 
created a Web Service; and third, the QaaWS-connection setup in the Data Manager 
to connect to the Web Service.
Because we cannot preview the data in the SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards spreadsheet like 
we did in the Creating a news ticker with Excel XML Maps recipe, we used the Spreadsheet 
Table component to check how the cells are populated when running the dashboard.
There's more...
Some other important concepts when using Query as a Web Service include the use of 
prompts and methods.
Using prompts
QaaWS prompts make it possible to load only the data that the dashboard user needs when 
using the dashboard.
1.	 Repeat steps 1 until 4 of the recipe. Before clicking Next in the fourth step, add the 
dimension that you want a filter on into the Filter Objects area. Select the Prompt 
option by clicking the little arrow on the right.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
234
2.	 The Answer prompts window will appear. Here, select one of the available values to 
enable QaaWS to create a preview of the data in the next screen and click OK.
3.	 As you can see in the Preview screen, the prompt filter object we added is now shown 
as an Input Parameters. Publish the QaaWS.

Chapter 8
235
4.	 Repeat steps 8 until 11 of the recipe.
5.	 The prompt is now displayed in the Input Values area. Bind the prompt to cell A1.
6.	 Go to the Usage tab and bind the Trigger Cell field to cell A1 and ensure that When 
Value Changes is selected. Now the data will only be refreshed when the value in this 
cell changes. Close the Data Manager.
7.	
Set up a Spreadsheet Table component like we did in step 13 of the recipe.
8.	 Add a Combo Box component and add the Labels for the prompt. Select Label as 
the Insertion Type and bind the Destination field to cell A1.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
236
9.	 Preview the dashboard and switch between the different labels to see the different 
data selections being loaded into the dashboard.
Methods
As you might have noticed while creating a QaaWS connection in SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards, there are several different methods you can use in the Definition tab. These 
methods can be split into two groups: to retrieve data and to list available parameter values:
f
f
runQueryAsAService: This is the default selected option that we also used for the 
examples in this recipe. It enables us to send out parameter values and retrieve data.
f
f
runQueryAsAServiceEx: This method gives the same output results as 
runQueryAsAService, but instead of providing an exact input parameter value, 
we can now also provide its index.
f
f
valuesOf_parameter: This method will return a list of values for its input 
parameter, which can be used to create a selector like we did in the Using 
prompts section.
Remember that each QaaWS connection can only use a single method, so you might have to 
set up more than one connection.

Chapter 8
237
Using Live Office Connection
With SAP BusinessObjects Live Office it is possible to insert data from Crystal Reports 
documents and Web Intelligence reports into Microsoft Office products (Word, Excel, Outlook, 
PowerPoint). Since data can also be refreshed with this add-on, the Live Office Connection can 
be a very useful way to provide our dashboards with fresh data.
Getting ready
For this recipe you will need SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform to be installed on your machine 
and the Live Office Connection software installed on your client computer. You will also need a 
Crystal Reports document, a Web Intelligence report, or a Universe to connect to.
How to do it...
1.	 Open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file and go to Preferences... in the File 
menu. In the Excel Options section, check if Live Office Compatibility is enabled.
For better tool stability, only enable this option when you 
are actually using Live Office in your dashboard.
2.	 Go to the Live Office tab of the spreadsheet. Click the Crystal Reports or 
Web Intelligence button to insert a report.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
238
In this recipe we will use a report as a data source. You can also choose 
Universe Query here to connect directly to a Universe.
3.	 Log in to your SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform and choose a report.
4.	 If your report contains any parameters, a window will appear in which you can enter 
the parameter values to filter the dataset that should be retrieved. In the There's more... 
section of this recipe we will discuss how to connect these prompts to the dashboard.
5.	 In the next window, the actual Crystal Reports document or Web Intelligence report 
is shown. With some mouse dragging and selecting you can select the data you want 
to import.

Chapter 8
239
6.	 Click the Switch to Fields button to see an overview of all available fields. Here you 
can also select which fields you want to use.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
240
7.	
If you want to set some more filters on fields, you can use the next window by clicking 
on Next.
8.	 In the final window, you can enter a name for the Live Office objects you just set up. 
Click Finish.
9.	 As you will see, the spreadsheet is now populated with data from the report.
10.	 Go to the Data Manager and add a Live Office Connections connection.

Chapter 8
241
11.	 Change the Sessions URL to point to the SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform server. 
Ranges are already bound to the cells in which the data has been imported. As you 
can see, Headers and Data Grid are separated. Do not forget to set up the Usage 
tab (see the Creating a news ticker with Excel XML Maps recipe).
 
How it works...
With the Live Office Connection we retrieve data from Crystal Reports documents, 
Web Intelligence reports, or connect directly to a Universe. In this way we can reuse 
the definitions that are created in these reports as a base for our dashboard data.
There's more...
Just like we have seen in the Using Query as a Web Service (QaaWS) recipe, it is possible 
to use prompts to select the data that we want to retrieve and use it in our dashboard with 
a Live Office Connection. Use the following steps to set this up:
1.	 In the Live Office tab of the spreadsheet, select the Modify Object button and 
choose Prompt Setting....

Dashboard Data Connectivity
242
2.	 In the window that appears you will see the available parameters. After selecting 
the parameter you want to use, select Choose Excel data range.
3.	 Bind the field to a spreadsheet cell.
4.	 Follow step 6 until 9 of the There's more... section on Using prompts of the Using Query 
as a Web Service (QaaWS) recipe to use this prompt from within your dashboard.

Using BI Web Services to consume a 
Webi report
BI Web Services is a data connection that works in basically two steps: first, a Web Intelligence 
(Webi) dataset report is created, similar to that of Live Office. Second, in SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards this dataset is consumed as a Query as a Web Service.
The benefit of using BI Web Services is that it combines the strengths of both Live Office and 
Query as a Web Service. These benefits include:
f
f
The ability to perform complex calculations such as crosstabs, special aggregations, 
advanced contexts, and so on in the Webi document
f
f
The ability to schedule reports so that we don't run into issues with queries that take 
a long time to execute
f
f
We do not have to load the Webi report inside SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards, 
thus not requiring the extra Live Office bridge connection, which slows down 
dashboard performance considerably
In addition, BI Web Services has the ability to:
f
f
Perform filtering within a dataset. Basically, this is like viewing a scheduled Webi 
document and filtering further within that dataset. This is extremely important, 
because one of the limitations with Live Office is its inability to consume datasets 
greater than 500 rows. Earlier, we would have to consume the entire scheduled 
dataset from Live Office. However, now we can filter the scheduled dataset 
beforehand and then consume the filtered set in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards. 
We have tested filtering on datasets of 20k+ rows and the performance is great!

Drill up and down hierarchies as shown in the following screenshot:
 

Dashboard Data Connectivity
244
Getting ready
Using the eFashion universe, create the following Webi document that contains Year, State, 
and Sales Revenue:
 
How to do it...
We will first show you how to create a BI Web Service and then how to consume it in SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards.
Creating the BI Web Service
1.	 Open up the Webi document, right-click on the dataset, and select Publish as 
Web Service.

Chapter 8
245
 
2.	 You will encounter a series of wizard instructions. Click Next until you reach 
the Publish Content menu. Enter a name for your dataset. Then click on the 
Set filters… button to set the appropriate filters on the dataset.
 

Dashboard Data Connectivity
246
3.	 Set Year as a filter and uncheck the rest. Then click OK.
 
4.	 Click Manage servers… and make sure the correct server setting is in the box.

Chapter 8
247
5.	 If this is your first BI Web Service, the next window will show an empty tree structure. 
Click on the folder icon to create the new web service and name it BIWS_Demo.
 

Dashboard Data Connectivity
248
6.	 Now, if you click on the Web Service Publisher icon, on the left you'll be able to see 
the new BI Web Service that you just created.
 

Chapter 8
249
Creating a BI Web Service connection in SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards
1.	 Click on the Data Manager icon and add a Web service query (Query as a 
Web Service)* connection.
 
2.	 Create a Dropdown component that allows the user to select a year, which we will 
use to filter the dataset appropriately.
 

Dashboard Data Connectivity
250
3.	 Now name the Web service query selection BIWS_Demo. On the left-hand input 
side, bind the value input parameter to the year dropdown output. Set the operator 
parameter to the value in.
 
4.	 Now if you scroll down the input values window, you will see bindings for refresh and 
getFromLatestDocumentInstance. Refresh means that the query will execute every 
time, and getFromLatestDocumentInstance means that we will be grabbing the 
dataset from the latest scheduled instance. In our example, we will just execute the 
query every time. So set refresh to 1.

Chapter 8
251
 
5.	 In the Output Values section on the right, set the output binding for the row. Let's 
assume that the maximum size we can have for a table is 20 rows. Bind the row 
output to a 3 x 20 dataset.
 

Dashboard Data Connectivity
252
6.	 Click on the Usage tab and bind the trigger cell to the year output cell. Make sure the 
When Value Changes option is selected.
 
7.	
Now bind a Spreadsheet Table component to the output dataset.
8.	 Preview the dashboard and you will see that every time the year in the dropdown 
changes, the data results will also change.
How it works…
BI Web Services works by allowing users to consume a Webi document with any third-party 
application that accepts web services. In short, we create a Webi report and then publish the 
web service. Then using SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards or any other application that can 
call web services, we can retrieve the Webi report data with the appropriate inputs entered.
There's more…
As mentioned earlier, there is drilldown capability in hierarchies using BI Web Services. 
You can visit http://blog.davidg.com.au/2011/03/drill-down-in-xcelsius-
using-bi.html to learn how to do so.
Finally, it is important to know the limitations that exist within BI Web Services. A great 
link on some of the limitations that we have discovered can be found in the presentation 
at http://www.scribd.com/doc/94112911/Leveraging-BI-Web-Services. 
The limitations and workarounds have been mentioned at the end of the presentation.

253
Using the SAP NetWeaver BW Connection
With the SAP NetWeaver BW Connection, we can deliver SAP BW data to dashboards that 
are hosted on the same SAP BW system. With this setup we don't need a separate SAP 
BusinessObjects BI Platform to host the dashboards, and the connections to source systems.
The Using the Query Browser recipe later in the chapter will demonstrate 
how to connect to SAP BW data from the SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform, 
as the workflow is the same as connecting to a Universe.
Getting ready
To set up a connection between SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards and SAP BW, you have to 
make sure that your SAP installation fulfills the following minimal technical requirements:
f
f
SAP BW 7.01, service pack 05 with ABAP and Java stacks deployed
f
f
SAP BusinessObjects Xcelsius Enterprise 2008 Service Pack 02
f
f
SAP Frontend 7.x installed at client with BI Add-Ons
For this recipe we are using a simple BEx Query to connect to.
How to do it...
1.	 Open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file. Open the Data Manager and add 
a new SAP NetWeaver BW Connection.
2.	 Click on the Browse button to log in to the SAP BW system. Select the correct SAP 
BW system, enter your login credentials, and click OK.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
254
3.	 Use the Find option to search for your query. Click Open to select the query.
4.	 Go to the Data Preview tab and click the Refresh Data Preview button. A preview 
of the layout of the returned data will now be shown here. In our example, there are 
seven columns: four characteristics and three key figures.

Chapter 8
255
The Data Preview tab has the option to rearrange the layout of 
the output of the BEx Query and add/remove characteristics by 
using drag and drop.
5.	 Go back to the Definition tab.
6.	 Select Cross-Tab Data from the Output Values section and bind it to the spreadsheet. 
For each column in the Data Preview tab (step 4) you need a column in the 
spreadsheet.
7.	
Go to the Usage tab and select the Refresh Before Components Are Loaded option. 
Close the Data Manager.
8.	 Add a Spreadsheet Table component to the canvas and bind it to the same cell range 
as you did in step 6.
9.	 If you hit the Preview button a message will appear stating that it is not possible 
to preview this dashboard with BI Query connection data and whether you want to 
continue. If you hit Yes, the dashboard will be previewed without live data from SAP BW.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
256
10.	 For this example, click No. The Publishing to SAP BW recipe in Chapter 9, Exporting 
and Publishing, covers the Launch function to deploy the dashboard with an active 
connection to SAP BW.
How it works...
The SAP NetWeaver BW Connection enables us to retrieve data from a SAP BW system 
via a BEx Query. For this example, we used a simple BEx Query we created in the BEx Query 
Designer with four characteristics in the rows and three key figures in the columns. In the 
properties of the characteristics we defined the Results Rows as Always Suppress so the 
output won't include this row.
If we run this BEx Query, the result would be as in the following screenshot. The first row 
shows the headers for the three key figures. The second row shows the headers for the four 
characteristics. In this row the Unit information for the key figures placed (EUR) is also placed 
when available.

Chapter 8
257
Running the original BEx Query is a great way to get an overview of how the 
data output will eventually look when setting up the spreadsheet. Moreover, 
if you are using multiple characteristics and key figures, this will give you a 
view that is clearer than the Data Preview tab in the Data Manager.
There's more...
In this section, we will take a detailed look at the options for data input and output in the SAP 
NetWeaver BW Connection.
Using variables and filters
Just as we have seen how to use prompts in the Using Query as a Web Service (QaaWS) 
recipe, we can use BEx Query variables and filters to fetch a limited set of data by following 
these steps:
Variables are only available if they are defined in the BEx Query as Input 
Variables. However, the SAP NetWeaver BW Connection can use any free 
characteristic from a BEx Query to set filters on. Even the Key Figures can 
be filtered!
1.	 Go to the Data Manager.
2.	 In the Output Values area search for Variables and select Value Help for the variable 
you want to use.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
258
3.	 Bind Current Filter Value (Key) to a range of cells. In these cells the values you can 
choose from will be inserted.
4.	 In the Input Values area select the variable and bind it to a cell. This cell should 
contain the value that the BEx Query uses as input for the variable.
5.	 Now add any Selector component to the canvas.
6.	 Bind its Labels field to the cell range you bound to in step 3.
7.	
Set the Insertion Type to Label and bind the Destination field to the same cell as you 
bound to in step 4.
The procedure for filters is the same as for variables. The only difference is that in the Output 
Values area you need to select the Characteristics instead of the Variables elements.
If you are using a BEx Query variable that represents 
a data interval, the value that you use as input for this 
variable should have the following format: StartValue - 
EndValue, (a space before and after the minus).
For a BEx Query variable that supports the input of 
multiple values, the input value should have the following 
format: Value1; Value2; Value3 (a semicolon 
followed by a space between the values).
You can use the Excel Concatenate function to combine 
the output of two selectors in a single cell and bind this 
cell to the variable in the Input Values area.

Chapter 8
259
The master data values that we added to the dashboard in steps 2 and 3 
of this section contain by default values of posted data. In the BEx Query 
Designer, we can alter this setting in the Extended tab of the Properties of a 
characteristic under the Filter Value Selection at Query Execution section.
Only Posted Values for Navigation: Only values that are in the result set 
of the BEx Query are available. This implies that master data values might 
disappear when a certain filter has been set.
Only Values in InfoProvider: Only the master data values that are in the 
InfoProvider are used.
Values in Master Data Table: All available master data values of the 
characteristic will be used, whether they are present in the InfoProvider or not.
Other Output Values
The Output Values area includes the following elements:
f
f
Cross-Tab Data: Provides the complete query output
f
f
Characteristics: Provides fields to create a list of values
f
f
Variables: Also provides fields to create a list of values
f
f
Static Filter: Gives information about the filters that have already been created in the 
BEx Query
f
f
Information: Provides information about the BEx Query itself, like the Query Technical 
Name or the Last Data Update

Dashboard Data Connectivity
260
f
f
Messages: Provides BEx Query error messages
Returned data format
The SAP NetWeaver BW connection gives us the option to let the data return as Raw or 
Formatted. By default, the Raw option is selected, as seen in the following screenshot. 
If you choose Formatted, the BEx format will be used, which means that the data includes 
information such as the number of decimals and currency.
Using the Query Browser
The Query Browser feature differs from the other data connection methods in that we 
can create a query from a Universe or a BEx Query without leaving SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards. Also, with Query Browser we can bind the result data not only to the 
spreadsheet but also directly to the components on the canvas.

Chapter 8
261
Getting ready
Open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file and activate the Query Browser pane from 
the View menu. You will also need a SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform environment with a 
Universe that you want to connect to.
If you want to connect to a BEx Query, you need an OLAP Connection to a SAP BW system. 
In the recipe we will follow the workflow for the Universe. In the There's more... section of 
this recipe, we will take a look at connecting to a BEx Query.
Note that only .unx Universes are supported. You can use the 
Information Design Tool to convert .unv Universes to .unx.
How to do it...
1.	 Go to the Query Browser pane and click on the Add Query button.
2.	 If you are not already connected to the SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform, a popup 
will appear asking you to log in. Enter the system and user credentials to log in.
3.	 You can choose between selecting a Universe or a BEx query. Choose Universe.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
262
4.	 A list with available Universes appears. Select the Universe you want to use and 
click Next.
5.	 In the Build Query screen you can define the Universe query. Drag a dimension and a 
measure to the Result Objects section.
6.	 Drag a dimension you want to filter into the Filter Objects Area.
7.	
Set this filter to Equal to Prompt. The Edit Prompt screen will pop up. Check Optional 
prompt. Click OK.
If you are a seasoned Webi developer, you might have noticed that the 
Build Query screen looks a lot like the Query Panel in Webi. The Webi 
version has a lot more advanced features though, such as creating a 
combined query with union, intersection, or minus nestings.

Chapter 8
263
8.	 Click the Next button to go to the Preview Query Results screen.
9.	 Since we added a prompt, we now need to select a value to fill this prompt to retrieve 
some preview data. Select a value from the list and click Run.
10.	 The result of the query will be shown now. Click Next.
11.	 The final screen is the Usage Options screen, which looks exactly the same as the 
Usage tab in the Data Manager. Leave everything with the default values selected 
and click OK.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
264
12.	The query will be added to the Query Browser pane, including the Result Objects, 
Filters, and Prompts you selected.
13.	Bind each dimension and measure of the Result Objects area to a column in 
the spreadsheet.
14.	 Add a Spreadsheet Table component to the canvas. Bind its Display Data field to the 
cells you bound the dimensions and measures to in the previous step.
15.	Add a Query Prompt Selector component from the Universe Connectivity category 
and select the prompt you just created from the Source Prompt menu.

Chapter 8
265
You can also select the prompt from the Query Browser pane and 
drag the component into the canvas.
16.	 At the bottom of the General tab you can define whether you want the query to be 
refreshed after the selection has been made, or after clicking the button. Here you 
can also change the Button Label.
17.	 Preview the dashboard!
How it works...
The Query Browser gives us the opportunity to connect a dashboard to a Universe without 
leaving SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards to set up QaaWS, Live Office, or a BI Webservice. 
Also, we don't have to use the spreadsheet in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards since we 
can bind the query results directly to the components.
We used the Query Prompt Selector component to filter the dataset. The component shows 
a list of values, and after hitting the Apply button the data is refreshed.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
266
From the Query Browser we inserted the output of the query into the spreadsheet, from 
which we used the data to be displayed in a Spreadsheet Table component. Of course, you 
can also add, for example, a chart component and use the Query Data option to connect to 
the result data.
There's more...
In this section, we will look into one more related component and discuss several connectivity 
options (SAP BW BEx Query, SAP HANA, and SAP ECC).
Query Refresh Button
With the Query Refresh Button component, which is also located in the Universe Connectivity 
category, you are able to manually refresh the query. After adding this component to the canvas 
you need to select the queries that should be refreshed after clicking the button.
SAP BW BEx Query
In step 3 of the primary recipe we chose to connect to a Universe instead of a BEx query. 
The workflow with a BEx query is almost the same:
1.	 Instead of choosing Universe, choose BEx query as a data source.
2.	 The OLAP Connections that are configured in your SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform 
are shown now. Select the OLAP Connection to the SAP BW system.
Before a BEx query is accessible in the Query Browser, the Allow External 
Access to this Query setting has to be enabled in the BEx Query Designer. 
You can find this setting in the Extended tab of the Properties menu of the 
BEx query.

Chapter 8
267
3.	 Now you can select the BEx query by either browsing through the InfoArea or 
using the search option. As you can see in the following screenshot, only the first 
BEx query (0PT_MP01_Q0003) is available. The others are grayed out since the 
External Access option isn't switched on yet.
4.	 You can now continue from step 5 of the primary recipe.
Using SAP HANA as a data source
It is possible to use SAP HANA views (attribute, analytical, or calculation view) as a data 
source for your dashboard. The only thing you need to do is to create a Universe based on 
a connection to a SAP HANA system. From there you can reach the Universe in the Query 
Browser in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards and use it just like any other Universe.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
268
Using SAP ECC tables as a data source
SAP ECC contains its own little SAP BW Client within itself. This provides us with the opportunity 
to use data directly from SAP ECC tables in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards. This topic falls a 
bit outside the scope of this book, so we won't go into detail, but the general steps you have to 
take are as follows:
1.	 Activate the SAP BW client within SAP ECC using the RSRTS_ACTIVATE_R3IS program.
2.	 Create an InfoSet using t-code SQ02.
3.	 Activate the BI Release property for the InfoSet using t-code SQBWPROP.
4.	 Create a BEx Query on this InfoSet with BEx Query Designer.
5.	 Create an OLAP Connection in the SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards BI 
Platform to this BEx Query.
6.	 Use the Query Browser to connect to the BEx Query.
Passing values from dashboard to 
dashboard with Flash Variables
A common requirement is to be able to have two dashboards interact with each other 
by passing variables from one dashboard to another. In our example, we have a parent 
dashboard that encapsulates several children dashboards. In this recipe, we will show 
you how to pass values from one dashboard to another using Flash Variables.
How to do it...
1.	 Open up a new Dashboard model and drag an Input Text component and a SWF 
Loader component into the canvas.
2.	 Go to the spreadsheet and enter Company A in cell A1. This is the default value 
that will be passed to the second dashboard.
3.	 In cell A2 type child.swf?Variable1= and in cell A3 type 
=CONCATENATE(A2,A1).
4.	 Link the Input Text component to cell A1. Also make sure you select the 
Insert Data On Load option and bind its Destination field to cell A1.
5.	 Bind the Source URL field of the SWF Loader component to cell A3.

Chapter 8
269
6.	 Save and export this dashboard to an SWF file. See the Exporting to SWF, PPT, 
PDF, and other file types recipe in Chapter 9, Exporting and Publishing, for more 
information. Name this SWF file parent.swf.
7.	
Open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file and drag a Label 
component into the canvas.
8.	 Now bind this Label component to cell A1.
9.	 Define this cell as Named Range Variable1. See the Using named ranges recipe 
in Chapter 1, Staying in Control, for more information on how to do this.
10.	 Decrease the size of the canvas by clicking the Fit Canvas to Components option in 
the Standard Toolbar. You can also find these options in the View menu.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
270
11.	 Your setup should now look like this:
12.	Now go to the Data Manager. Add a Flash Variables connection.
13.	Click on the Import Named Ranges button. The named range you just created will 
pop up in the Ranges window. You can now close the Data Manager.

Chapter 8
271
14.	 Save and export the dashboard to an SWF file. Make sure the name of this file is 
child.swf.
15.	Open parent.swf. Change Company A into another value, click outside the text 
input box or hit the Enter key, and see what happens.

Dashboard Data Connectivity
272
How it works...
We just created two dashboards: a parent dashboard and a child dashboard, where the child 
dashboard is loaded in the parent dashboard with the SWF Loader component. The Source 
URL in this SWF Loader component not only points to the location of the child dashboard 
(child.swf) but also contains a variable with a value (?Variable1=CompanyA). With a 
Flash Variables data connection, the child dashboard is able to read the value from this 
variable and put it in a spreadsheet cell during runtime.
We used the Excel Concatenate formula, so each time the variable value changes, a new URL 
is created. The SWF Loader reloads the child dashboard whenever the Source URL changes.
There's more...
Using more than one variable is easy. Just repeat the steps of this recipe and make sure you 
separate the variables with an ampersand (&). For example, a URL with two variables would 
look like this: child.swf?Variable1=Value1&Variable=Value2.
Besides using more than one variable, it is also possible to pass multiple values through a 
single variable as described in the following steps:
1.	 Reopen the child dashboard you created earlier.
2.	 Open the Data Manager and select the Flash Variables connection you already 
created.
3.	 Change the Variable Format from XML to CSV.

Chapter 8
273
4.	 Bind the Range of Variable1 to cell A1:A3. Close the Data Manager.
5.	 Replace the Label component with a Spreadsheet Table component.
6.	 Bind this Spreadsheet Table component to cells A1:A3.
7.

Introduction
After creating your dashboard, you will need to publish it into a format that everyone is 
able to view.
A dashboard model is compiled into a Shockwave Flash (SWF) file format. Compiling to an 
SWF file format ensures that the dashboard plays smoothly on different screen sizes and 
across different platforms. It also ensures that users aren't given huge files that are larger 
than 10 megabytes.
SWF is an Adobe Flash file format used for multimedia vector graphics 
and ActionScript. SWF can contain animations or applets of varying 
degrees of interactivity and function. For more information on SWF, visit 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWF.

Exporting and Publishing
276
Developers can publish dashboards to a format of their choice. The available choices include 
Flash (SWF), HTML, PDF, MS PowerPoint, MS Outlook, MS Word, and the SAP BusinessObjects 
BI Platform (both desktop and mobile). Once publishing is complete, the dashboard is ready 
to be shared!
Exporting to SWF, PPT, PDF, and 
other file types
After developing a visual model in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards, we will need to somehow 
share it with users. We want to put it into a format that everyone can see on their machines. 
The simplest way is to export it to a standard SWF file.
One of the great features SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards has is the ability to embed 
dashboards into different Microsoft Office file formats. For example, a presenter could have 
an MS PowerPoint deck, and in the middle of the presentation, have a working dashboard 
that presents an important set of data values to the audience. Another example could be an 
executive level user who is viewing an MS Word document created by an analyst. The analyst 
could create a written document in MS Word and then embed a working dashboard with the 
most updated data to present important data values to the executive level user.
You can choose to embed a dashboard in the following file types:
f
f
MS PowerPoint (.pptx)
f
f
MS Word (.docx)
f
f
MS Outlook
f
f
PDF (.pdf)
f
f
HTML (.html)
Getting ready
Make sure your dashboard is complete and ready to be shared.
How to do it...
1.	 In the menu toolbar, go to File | Export | Flash (SWF).

Chapter 9
277
2.	 Select the directory in which you want the SWF to go to and name your SWF file.
How it works...
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards compiles the visual model into an SWF file that everyone 
is able to see. Once the SWF file has been compiled, the dashboard will then be ready 
for sharing.
It is mandatory that anyone viewing the dashboard SWF has Adobe Flash 
installed. If not, they can download and install it from http://www.adobe.
com/products/flashplayer/.
If we export to MS PowerPoint, we can then edit the PowerPoint file however we desire.
If you have an existing PowerPoint presentation deck and want to append the dashboard to it, 
the easiest way is to first embed the dashboard SWF to a temporary PowerPoint file and then 
copy that slide to your existing PowerPoint file.
There's more...
Exporting to an SWF file format makes it very easy for distribution, thus making the 
presentation of mockups great at a business level. Developers are thus able to work 
very closely with the business and iteratively come up with a visual model closest to the 
business goals. It is important though, when distributing SWF files, that everyone viewing the 
dashboards has the same version, otherwise confusion may occur. Thus, as a best practice, 
versioning every SWF that is distributed is very important.
Publishing to SAP BusinessObjects 
BI Platform
Dashboards can be saved to the SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform. The platform hosts the 
dashboards so that users can easily access them through the BI Launchpad (formerly known 
as InfoView) or via the SAP BusinessObjects BI Mobile app for mobile dashboards (see the 
recipe Going mobile later in this chapter). Also, administrators can control the dashboard's 
security on the platform.
Getting ready
Make sure your dashboard is complete and ready for sharing.

Exporting and Publishing
278
How to do it...
1.	 From the menu toolbar, go to File | Save To Platform | Desktop Only.
2.	 Enter your SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform login credentials and then select the 
location in the SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform system where you want to store 
the SWF file, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 9
279
3.	 Log in to BI Launchpad and verify that you can access and run the dashboard.
How it works...
When we export a dashboard to the SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform, we store it in the 
repository. From there, we can control accessibility to the dashboard and make sure that 
we have one source of of the actual dashboard instead of sending out multiple dashboards 
through e-mail and possibly getting mixed up with what is the latest version. When we log in to 
BI Launchpad it also passes the login token to the dashboard, so we don't have to enter our 
credentials again when connecting to SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform data. This is important 
because we don't have to manually create and pass any additional tokens once we have 
logged in.
There's more...
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards supports saving a dashboard offline at runtime. This means 
that a user can create an offline snapshot of the dashboard that contains data retrieved at 
the time of saving and store that copy on their local machine. When doing this, all external 
data connections are disabled and connectivity-related components, such as the Connection 
Refresh Button, are also disabled.
Enabling offline dashboards is easy. Go to File | Document Properties and select the Allow 
This Dashboard to be Used Offline option.

Exporting and Publishing
280
To save the dashboard while running it, right-click anywhere on the background of the 
dashboard and click Save Current Copy of Dashboard to Local Disk.

To give a true website type feel, developers can house their dashboards in a website type 
format using a BI Workspace. This in turn provides a better experience for users, as they 
don't have to navigate through many folders in order to access the dashboard that they 
are looking for.
Housing your dashboard in a BI Workspace
Using a BI Workspace (formerly known as Dashboard Builder), which is part of the SAP 
BusinessObjects BI Platform to organize your dashboards, allows users to customize the look 
and feel of how dashboards are accessed. In addition, administrators can control access to 
each navigational layout. When we house dashboards in a BI Workspace, users don't have to 
navigate through numerous folders in order to reach their desired dashboard, but instead use 
web page style links to access their dashboard.
In our example, we will set up a BI Workspace, which will contain links to three dashboards.
Getting ready
Make sure you have your dashboards created and saved on the SAP BI Platform. Refer to the 
previous recipe, Publishing to SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform, to learn how to do this. In our 
example, we use three dashboards, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 9
281
How to do it...
1.	 Log in to BI Launchpad and choose BI Workspace from the Applications menu.
2.	 Select Template from the Layout drop-down box. From the Predefined templates 
drop-down box that now appears, select 2 Rows.

Exporting and Publishing
282
3.	 In the Module Library on the left, click on the Public Modules icon (third option). 
Here you can browse the BI documents on the BI Platform. Drag and drop your 
dashboards into the two sections.

Chapter 9
283
4.	 Now click the + Add a new tab button and give the new tab a name.
5.	 Drag the third dashboard into the section.
6.	 Click on the Save button, give your BI Workspace a name, and save it on the 
BI Platform.

Exporting and Publishing
284
7.	
Click on the Exit Edit Mode button on the upper-right side of the screen. This is how 
the BI Workspace will look to users:
How it works...
As you can see, when we set up a BI Workspace, it is easier to access the dashboards rather 
than clicking through a bunch of folders. You can think of a BI Workspace as a container that 
holds a set of dashboards.

There are some more neat things that you can accomplish with BI Workspaces.
Setting a BI Workspace as a home tab for BI Launchpad
In the General section of the Preferences menu of BI Launchpad, we can define how the 
Home tab for BI Launchpad should look. We can set a BI Workspace as the home tab with 
the following steps. So, when the user logs in to BI Launchpad, they will instantly see the 
BI Workspace.
1.	 Go to the Preferences menu of BI Launchpad and select the General tab.
2.	 Deselect Use Default Settings.
3.	 Select the Home tab radio option, select Select Home tab, and then click on the 
Browse Home Tab button. Now select your BI Workspace and adjust the title text.
4.	 Click on Save & Close to finish.
5.	 Log in to BI Launchpad again and you'll see the BI Workspace pop up right away!
Support for other types of BI documents
BI Workspaces not only support dashboards but other BI documents such as Crystal Reports, 
Web Intelligence Reports, and even websites!

Exporting and Publishing
286
Content linking
A BI Workspace has the option to set up communication between the different documents. 
This allows the passing of values between documents that are placed on the same tab in a BI 
Workspace. For example, a selection made in a dashboard can lead to a change of data in a 
Web Intelligence document.
This feature lies outside the scope of this book, but you can check the BI Workspaces user 
guide by SAP for more information.
You can find the BI Workspaces User Guide at http://help.sap.
com/businessobject/product_guides/boexir4/en/
xi4_bi_workspace_user_en.pdf.
Publishing to SAP BW
This recipe shows you how to publish a dashboard to a SAP BW system. Once a dashboard 
is saved to the system, it can be published within a SAP Enterprise Portal iView and made 
available for users to view.
Getting ready
For this recipe, you will need a completed dashboard. This dashboard does not necessarily 
have to include a data connection to SAP BW.
How to do it...
1.	 Select Publish in the SAP menu. If you want to save the SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards model with a different name, select the Publish As... option.

Chapter 9
287
2.	 If you are not yet connected to the SAP BW system, a pop up will appear. Select the 
appropriate system and fill in your username and password in the dialog box.
3.	 If you want to disconnect from the SAP BW system and connect to a different system, 
select the Disconnect option from the SAP menu.
4.	 Enter the Description and Technical Name of the dashboard. You can choose to 
save the dashboard as a role or just into your Favorites folder. Click on Save. 
The dashboard is now published to the SAP BW system.

Exporting and Publishing
288
5.	 To launch the dashboard and view it from the SAP BW environment, select the 
Launch option from the SAP menu. You will be asked to log in to the SAP BW 
system before you can view the dashboard.
How it works...
As we have seen in this recipe, the publishing of a dashboard to SAP BW is quite 
straightforward. As the dashboard is part of the SAP BW environment after publishing, 
the model can be transported between SAP BW systems like all other SAP BW objects.
There's more...
After launching the dashboard in step 5 of this recipe, the dashboard will load in your browser 
from the SAP BW server. You can add the displayed URL to a SAP Enterprise Portal iView to 
make the dashboard accessible for portal users.
Going mobile
With SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 4.0 Service Pack 5, a big new feature was introduced: 
mobile dashboards. This feature enables the creation of HTML5-compatible dashboards 
that can be viewed on mobile devices such as the iPad. Instead of using the mouse pointer 
to interact with the dashboard, the user can now tap, touch, drag, and pinch to control 
the dashboard.
In this recipe, we will create a mobile dashboard and have a look at all the requirements and 
the supported and the unsupported options of this feature.

Chapter 9
289
Getting ready
To work with mobile dashboards, we need to meet the following requirements:
f
f
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 4.0 Service Pack 5 or higher
f
f
SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform 4.0 Service Pack 5 or higher, with mobile 
server deployed
f
f
SAP BusinessObjects Mobile app for iOS or Android
You can download the latest version of the SAP BusinessObjects Mobile app 
from the Apple App Store (iOS) or the Google Play Store (Android).
In this recipe, we will use a simple dashboard with some charts but without any connections.
How to do it...
1.	 First, we want to preview the dashboard to see how it would look in a mobile format. 
In the menu toolbar, go to File | Preview | Mobile (Fit to Screen) or use the button 
in the standard toolbar.

Exporting and Publishing
290
2.	 We can now check the look and interactions of the mobile dashboard. Click on a bar 
or a point on any chart to see how the mouseover values are displayed.
3.	 Leave the preview mode. Next, we are going to save our dashboard to the SAP 
BusinessObjects BI Platform. In the menu toolbar, go to File | Save To Platform | 
Mobile Only. Log in to the platform and select the location where you want to save 
the dashboard. Click the Save button to finish.

Chapter 9
291
If you want the dashboard to be available both as a mobile dashboard and a 
traditional desktop that is run through BI Launchpad, select the Desktop and 
Mobile option.
4.	 Grab your iPad or other mobile device and fire up the SAP BusinessObjects Mobile 
app. Log in to your SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform. You will see the dashboard 
that we just saved pop up on top.
5.	 Click on the View button to start the dashboard.

Exporting and Publishing
292
How it works...
Mobile dashboards are not exported to an SWF file, but to an HTML5-compatible object. 
We need the SAP BusinessObjects Mobile app to run the dashboard from the SAP 
BusinessObjects BI Platform.
There's more...
There are some neat features that can be accomplished with mobile dashboards as well as 
some limitations that we will talk about now.
The Mobile Compatibility panel
Unfortunately, not all components and connections are supported with mobile dashboards. 
When we use such a component it will simply be excluded from the mobile dashboard and the 
connection will obviously not work. To check whether we are using an unsupported item, we 
can use the Mobile Compatibility panel.
This panel lists all the components and connections that are used and notes if they are 
supported, unsupported, or have several unsupported features. In the following example, we 
can see that the Tree Map and Play Selector components aren't supported. The Combo Box 
has a few unsupported features. Connection 1, which is a SAP BW connection created with 
the Data Manager, is also not supported. We can also see that a recommendation is given 
for the canvas sizing so that it matches the iPad screen format.

Chapter 9
293
The following connection types are supported in mobile dashboards:
f
f
All connections created with the Query Browser
f
f
Web service query (Data Manager)
f
f
Flash Variables (Data Manager)
f
f
External Interface Connection
The supported Data Manager connections are denoted by an asterisk in the 
Data Manager.
Also, only the Nova theme is supported and you have to make sure that you only use fonts 
with (iOS5+) appended.
A detailed overview of all supported components and their specific 
unsupported properties or features can be found in the Help | Dashboards 
Help menu, under Mobile support | Supported components in mobile 
dashboards.
Sharing and annotating dashboards from the SAP 
BusinessObjects Mobile app
A nice feature of the SAP BusinessObjects Mobile app is that it not only lets us view the 
dashboard, but also allows us to make annotations to it and share it through e-mail and 
SAP StreamWork.
1.	 In the upper-right corner of the screen, click on the settings button to enable the 
option bar.

Exporting and Publishing
294
2.	 Click on Annotate. Here you can add lines and text, crop sections, and even add a 
voice memo to the dashboard.

Chapter 9
295
3.	 Click on Done. Now two new buttons will appear: Email and StreamWork. By clicking 
on one of these buttons, you can share a print of the dashboard, including the 
annotations you just made.

Introduction
As we have seen throughout this book, SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards gives us an 
almost overwhelming package of tools to create the most stunning dashboards. Even this 
may not be enough for your specific dashboard. With SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards, 
SDK (short for software development kit) developers are able to create add-ons for SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards to provide that extra functionality that does not come with 
the original software.

Top Third-party Add-ons
298
This chapter will discuss several of the top third-party SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 
add-ons that are available. Some of them can be downloaded for free while others need to 
be purchased. Without exception, all these add-ons are free to try out before you make the 
decision to buy one or not. We will not discuss all third-party add-ons that are available at the 
moment, as there are simply too many of them. We had to limit ourselves to those add-ons 
that stand out the most and are the most applicable to a large number of users.
The recipes in this chapter will not be as detailed as the other recipes in this book. The goal 
of this chapter is to give you a quick introduction to the basic functionality of the add-ons 
and how to set them up. After reading a recipe, you should have a good understanding of the 
possibilities of the add-on and whether it might be interesting for you to spend more time on it 
or not. We will also direct you towards useful resources for more information on each add-on.
Managing add-ons in SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards
In this recipe, we will show you where you can find third-party add-ons and how to add 
and remove them in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards. Dashboard add-ons will consist 
of the .xlx extension.
Getting ready
To install an add-on, you'll first need to download it. The following recipes in this chapter will 
guide you to the right places to get these files.
If you are using Windows Vista, you must turn off User Account Control 
(UAC), otherwise the Add-On Manager menu items will be disabled. 
To do so, go to Start | Control Panel | User Accounts | Turn User 
Account Control on or off.

Chapter 10
299
How to do it...
1.	 To add or remove add-ons, use the Add-On Manager. Go to the File menu and select 
Manage Add-Ons.
2.	 The Add-On Manager will pop up and show which add-ons are already installed. 
If you have already downloaded an add-on, you can click on the Install Add-On 
button. Browse to the add-on's XLX file and open it. The add-on will be installed 
instantly. You need to restart SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards to use the new 
add-on(s).
3.	 If you want to remove an add-on, first select the add-on and click on the Remove 
Add-On button. Confirm the removal and the add-on will be deleted from your SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards installation.
4.	 A good place to find add-ons is the SAP Store (http://store.sap.com/). 
On this website, you can find certified solutions not only for SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards, but also for other SAP enterprise applications. Since the add-ons don't 
have their own category, you could search for Xcelsius to get the most results.

Top Third-party Add-ons
300
The reason why it is best to search for Xcelsius is that SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards was recently rebranded and most add-ons 
were initially developed for Xcelsius. Also, SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 
as a search term may lead to generic search results.
5.	 Another place to find and download add-ons is on developer websites. In each recipe 
of this chapter, we will guide you to these sites.

Chapter 10
301
Connecting to CSV files with the CSV 
Connector
In Chapter 8, Dashboard Data Connectivity, we discussed a number of data connectivity 
options for dashboards in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards. In addition to these standard 
data connections, Centigon Solutions has developed an add-on that allows us to use Comma 
Separated Value (CSV) files to grab data from. This recipe will give you a quick walkthrough 
of the features of this add-on.
Getting ready
Go to the Centigon Solutions website (http://www.centigonsolutions.com/) and 
browse for CSV Connector. Download the free trial and install it with the Add-On Manager. 
You also need a sample CSV file to use in this recipe.
How to do it...
1.	 Open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file and go to the spreadsheet area. 
Enter the location of the CSV file in cell C1.
2.	 Open the Data Manager and click on the Add button. Under Add-On connection, 
you will see the CSV Connector. Select it.
3.	 Give this connection a name. Bind the CSV Data URL field to cell C1.

Top Third-party Add-ons
302
4.	 Also, check the Delimiter setting. This should match the format of your CSV file.
5.	 Go to the Data Preview tab and click on the Preview Data button. The data from 
the CSV file will now be shown. Note that the number of columns and rows is 
displayed as well.

Chapter 10
303
If nothing happens, your CSV file location may be wrong or a different 
delimiter may have been used in the CSV file. The use of a forward slash 
(/) or backward slash (\) in the URL is also a common cause as \ is used 
for the local network and / is used for SharePoint.
6.	 Go back to the Definition tab and bind the Data Destination field to a range of cells 
that match the format, as shown in the Data Preview tab.

Top Third-party Add-ons
304
7.	
Now add a filter on the dataset in the CSV file. Bind the Filter Columns field to a 
range of cells with the same number of columns as the data destination range. 
Close the Data Manager.
8.	 You can now set up a Combo Box component or another Selector component 
to change the values of these cells. Use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard to show all 
records in a column.
9.	 If you want to preview your dashboard, do not forget to select the Refresh On Load 
option in the Usage tab of the CSV Connector connection in the Data Manager.

Chapter 10
305
How it works...
The CSV Connector add-on from Centigon Solutions is an ideal data connector to handle input 
from CSV files if you do not have the option to use server data providers such as QaaWS or 
SAP BW. Especially for smaller enterprises, this is a very good solution to provide dashboards 
with fresh data. In addition, when comparing a CSV to an XLS data source, CSV files have no 
row limit, whereas XLS files are restricted to 1 million rows.
A nice feature of this component is the ability to preview the data in the data manager. This 
will help you to set up the component without having to preview the dashboard every time 
to check out how the data will be loaded in the spreadsheet.
In this recipe, we showed how to filter the dataset of the CSV file. You can use this option 
to load only the data you will actually need, which will improve the performance of the 
dashboard. Furthermore, in the Data Output Definition tab of this add-on in the Data 
Manager, you can define which columns and rows should be loaded.
If you filter a column, that column must be part of the output.
There's more...
Besides displaying the data from a CSV file and filtering the values, the CSV Connector 
add-on can also do some calculations as described in the following steps:
1.	 Add another row above the Data Destination area. There are four calculation values. 
Enter a calculation value for each column as follows:


Column 1: Lists the values separated by a comma


Column 2: Counts the number of rows


Column 3: Calculates the sum of values


Column 4: Calculates the average of values

Top Third-party Add-ons
306
2.	 Next, enter a single-value index that indicates which column the calculations are 
applied on.
3.	 Open the Data Manager and bind the Column Calculations field and the 
Column Calculation Index field to the corresponding cells you just entered 
in the spreadsheet.
4.	 Preview the dashboard to try this functionality.
The CSV Connector add-on also includes a component that is able to export a data range 
from a dashboard to a CSV file or to the clipboard. To learn more about this feature, visit 
the Centigon Solutions website at http://www.centigonsolutions.com/.

Integrating Google Maps with the 
CMaps plugin
In the Using maps to select data of an area or country recipe in Chapter 3, From a Static to 
an Interactive Dashboard, we introduced the standard map options that SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards offers. Then, in the Displaying alerts on a map recipe in Chapter 5, Using Alerts, 
we discussed how to use alerts on these maps. Centigon Solutions raised the bar on this topic 
and introduced the CMaps plugin for SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards.
With this add-on, we can completely integrate Google Maps in a dashboard in SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards. This means that we can use the graphics we know from Google 
Maps (map, satellite, hybrid, terrain, and so on) and functionalities such as zooming in or 
out on a map. Furthermore, the CMaps plugin integrates with other SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards components. We can make selections from a map region and display alerts, 
single points (such as cities or buildings), and heat maps on the map.
This recipe will introduce you to this add-on and show you how to create a map with alerts and 
selectable regions.
Getting ready
This recipe needs some preparation. First, go to the CMaps plugin website (http://www.
cmapsplugin.com/) and request the CMaps plugin add-on trial. You'll receive an e-mail 
with a download link and a trial key. Install the add-on with the Add-On Manager.
Next, we need a so-called shapefile. This provides the overlay for a geographical area. There 
are lots of free SHP files available on the Internet; for example, SHP files can be found 
at http://centigonknowledge.com/tutorial/shape-data-explorer-and-
download-manager/.
Download the ZIP archive of any shapefile you want to use and extract it. The extracted folder 
includes at least the SHP file, a DBF file, and an SHX file.
In this recipe, we will use a shapefile of Europe, but the steps are the same for shapefiles of 
other regions.
How to do it...
1.	 Open MS Excel and go to Open.
2.	 Set Files of type to All Files.

Top Third-party Add-ons
308
3.	 Browse for the DBF file and open it.
4.	 A spreadsheet with a list of countries will appear, including some additional, 
country-specific data.

Chapter 10
309
5.	 Save the file as an Excel Workbook.
6.	 Open SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards and import the Excel file you just created by 
selecting Import from the Data menu:
Or by clicking on the Import button:
7.	
A pop up will appear stating that you will lose everything in your existing spreadsheet. 
As we opened a blank SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file, we can click on Yes.
8.	 Insert five rows above the data from the DFB file. Right-click on row 1 and select 
Insert. Repeat this four times.

310
9.	 Enter your CMaps trial key in spreadsheet cell C1.
10.	 Drag the CMaps Plugin component to the canvas. You will find this component at the 
bottom of the Maps section.
11.	 Bind the Key field of the CMaps plugin to cell C1. The CMaps Plugin component will 
now change into a real Google Map of the world.
12.	Enter the location of the SHP file in cell C2.
13.	Select the Shape Data option and bind the Single shape file URL field to cell C2.

Chapter 10
311
14.	 Click on the button on the right of Shape Data to open the Shape Data Options 
screen. Here, select Shape File URL and click on OK.
15.	If you now hit the Preview button, the shapefile for Europe should be visible on top of 
the Google Map.
The shapefile will not appear in Preview mode if you are using a 
relative path.

16.	 Now return to the properties pane of the CMaps Plugin component and bind the 
Labels field and the Values field to the corresponding cells in the spreadsheet.
17.	 Set Insertion Type to Row and bind the Source Data field to the cells we just bound to 
the Labels and Values fields. Also bind the Destination field to cell range B4:C4.
18.	Add a Gauge component to the canvas and bind the Title field to cell B4 and the 
Data By Range field to cell C4.
19.	Select the CMaps Plugin component again and go to the Behavior tab.
20.	Deselect Dynamic Zoom.
21.	 Bind the Pan to Location field to cell C3.
22.	Enter 54.52596, 15.25512 in cell C3. These are the coordinates for mid-Europe.
23.	Go to the Alerts tab in the CMaps Plugin properties pane. Select Enable Alerts.
24.	 Select By Value and set the number of Alert Levels to 6.

How it works...
This recipe required a lot of preparation before we could perform the actual binding of the 
data to the CMaps Plugin component. In this recipe, we showed you how to use SHP files. 
These files provide a layer on top of the Google Map. This layer enables us to make regions 
selectable or fill them with colors to show alerts.
The DBF file provided us with the metadata on the SHP file (that is, the country codes and 
names). After importing this information into the spreadsheet, the setup of the CMaps Plugin 
component has a lot of similarities with the configuration of standard SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards Map components, as we discussed in Chapter 3, From a Static to an Interactive 
Dashboard, and Chapter 5, Using Alerts.
The SHX file can be used to combine SHP and DBF files for GIS solutions, where this file is 
required to maintain the integrity between the files when used in GIS solutions. The CMaps 
plugin does not utilize this SHX file.
In the Behavior tab, we entered the coordinates for Europe, so the map, by default, showed 
Europe. You can find these coordinates at http://www.map-gps-coordinates.com/.
In addition, if you want to zoom in or out, you can change the Zoom Level.
Setting up the alerts in the CMaps plugin works just like configuring the Alerts tab in standard 
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards components, with the addition that you can also use icons 
as alerts in the CMaps Plugin component.

Connecting to Salesforce.com with 
DashConn
What about using live data from your Salesforce.com reports in SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards to create interactive dashboards to show, track, and analyze your sales activities? 
DashConn is an add-on by IdeaCrop for SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards that delivers this 
integration. Let's have a look at the features of this add-on and how to set it up.
Getting ready
As we are connecting to Salesforce.com, you will obviously need a Salesforce.com 
Developer account. You can sign up for a free account at http://developer.
salesforce.com/signup.
To connect to Salesforce.com from a dashboard in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards, you 
will require a security token. You can get this security token from the Personal Setup menu 
at Salesforce.com.

Top Third-party Add-ons

You can download a free trial version of the DashConn add-on from the IdeaCrop website, 
http://www.ideacrop.com/.
How to do it...
1.	 Open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file and drag the Salesforce.com 
DataViewer component onto the canvas.
2.	 Go to the Reports tab and enter your Salesforce.com credentials. A list with your 
Salesforce.com reports will appear.
3.	 Select the report you want to use. A loading message will appear.
4.	 Now go to the Data Output tab and bind the Main result destination field to 
spreadsheet cell range A6:D20.

Chapter 10
317
5.	 Bind the Selection destination field to cell range G6:K20.
6.	 Make sure that the Place column names in the first row option is selected. 
We can use these column names later on when we add some chart components 
and have to bind the series names.
7.	
Preview the dashboard to see how the data is being returned (and filled in the 
spreadsheet cells that we bound in step 4). You will be asked to fill in your credentials.
8.	 Leave the Preview mode and drag a Column Chart component to the canvas.
9.	 Bind the Column Chart component to the columns you want to show in the chart. 
Remember that the first row will show the column names. Also, do not forget to select 
the Ignore Blank Cells options in the Behavior tab of the chart component. In this 
recipe example, we are showing two series: Actual Costs and Budgeted Costs.
10.	 Now add another chart to the canvas and bind it to one or more columns from the 
Selection destination area (step 5). In this recipe example, we want to show the 
Total Leads in a Bar Chart.
11.	 Preview the dashboard. As you will see, the Column Chart will display data right 
away. If you select a row in the Salesforce.com DataViewer component, the Bar 
Chart will also be filled.

318
You can use Ctrl and click or Shift and click to select multiple rows.
12.	Leave the Preview mode and add a Horizontal Slider component to the canvas.
13.	Bind the Data field of this component to cell C1.
14.	 Select the Salesforce.com DataViewer component again and go to the 
Data Output tab.

Chapter 10
319
15.	 We want to filter the records based on the value in the Total Responses column. To do 
this, select the correct column from the Prompt Column selector and bind the Prompt 
Value field to cell C1. For the Prompt Operator selector, we select greaterOrEqual.
16.	 Preview the dashboard once more.

How it works...
The Salesforce.com DataViewer component does most of the work for us. As you have 
seen, we only had to enter our Salesforce.com credentials, select a report, and preview the 
dashboard to see how the data will be returned. After binding the fields of the Data Output 
tab, we can reuse the report data in other components. 
The Salesforce.com DataViewer component has some nice runtime features to drill down or 
up in the report data, open the Salesforce.com details page of all selected items, set filters, 
and aggregate data by a certain field. With these options, you can dynamically change the 
data being retrieved by the Salesforce.com DataViewer component. This also means that 
the values in spreadsheet cells that are bound to the Main result destination field in the 
Data Output tab change as well.
There's more...
To conclude this recipe, we will discuss two more options: the Data Manager Connection 
and Working Mode settings.
Salesforce.com Data Manager Connection
A very nice feature of this add-on is that it also has a Connection option that is available 
from the Data Manager. With this Connection, you can use Salesforce.com report data 
in your dashboards without having to use the Salesforce.com DataViewer component. 
Another important feature of the Connection option is that it offers the ability to constantly 
refresh data from Salesforce.com reports—just like other Connection options—without being 
prompted for credentials. 

Chapter 10
321
Except for the Usage tab, most settings are similar to those of the Salesforce.com 
DataViewer component.
Working Mode settings
In the Behavior tab of the component and Data Manager Connection, you can find the 
Working Mode setting, as seen in the following screenshot. In the default Online setting, an 
Internet connection is required to use the component to connect to Salesforce.com. In Offline 
mode, the (first level of) report data is embedded within the dashboard. 

Top Third-party Add-ons
322
The third Online/ fallback to Offline mode is a combination of the online and offline modes 
and will try to retrieve live data first; but if this fails, it uses the embedded data.
Presenting micro charts in a Tree Grid
The Micro Chart Suite is an extensive set of small charting components by Inovista. It includes 
a micro version of most of the chart types that are part of the standard SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards components: Bar Chart, Area Chart, Stacked Bar Chart, Bullet Chart, Column 
Chart, Line Chart, and Pie Chart. In addition, there are components to show micro versions 
of a plot chart, win/lose chart, shape alerts, a traffic light, and a text/number indicator.
While you can use these components separately, a nice feature by Inovista is the Tree Grid 
component in which we can present micro charts in a hierarchical format. This recipe shows 
you how to set up the Tree Grid component with a few micro charts.
Getting ready
Go to the Inovista website (http://www.inovista.com/), browse for the trial 
downloads section, and download the Micro Chart Suite. Install the components with 
the Add-On Manager.

Chapter 10

How to do it...
1.	 First, we need to add some data to the spreadsheet. Open a new SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards file and add some data, as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Add a MicroChart Tree Grid component to the canvas.
3.	 Click on the insert button in the properties pane.
4.	 Select MicroTrafficLight as Chart Type.

5.	 In the Header Text column, enter Status as a title for this chart and set the 
Width Ratio to 10.
6.	 In the Data Source for Column: 1 section, bind the Chart Data field to cell range 
K6:K13. Bind the Target Data field to cell range L6:L13.
7.	
Insert a MicroLineChart into the Tree Grid and enter Monthly sales trend 
in the Header Text column. Also set the Width Ratio to 40.
8.	 Bind this chart to cell range E6:J13.
9.	 Insert a Micro100BarChart into the Tree Grid. Enter Market Share as the title for 
this column. Also set the Width Ratio to 40.
10.	 Bind this chart to cell range M6:M13.
11.	 Click on the Edit Column button. Select the Legends sub-tab.
12.	Select Use Chart Colors.

Chapter 10
325
13.	Select a dark color for the first value and a light color for the second.
14.	 Now return to the General tab and select the Tree Column sub-tab.
15.	Bind the Source Data field to cell range A6:C13.

Top Third-party Add-ons
326
16.	 Also set the Column Width to 250 and the Opening Indentation to 0.
17.	 Preview the dashboard and try to navigate through the hierarchy tree.
How it works...
As we have seen in this recipe, the Inovista Micro Chart Suite offers a good solution 
to present numerous data visualizations in a compact way. The MicroChart Tree Grid 
component gives us a framework to display these micro charts in a structured and 
hierarchical way.

Chapter 10
327
To use the MicroChart Tree Grid component, we have to define the spreadsheet in the 
right way. We first created a hierarchical structure with three levels—global, continents, 
and countries. Next, we added all the data for the graphs in the columns, where each 
node has its own row of data.
There's more...
If you don't want or don't need to show a hierarchical structure in your dashboard, you can use 
the MicroChart Table component as another container to present the micro charts in. The 
only difference is that this component doesn't have the Tree Column and Tree Row Colors 
sub-tabs.
As the MicroChart Table component doesn't have Tree Column to 
display the row headers, you could use a TextNumberIndicatorChart 
chart type to add these.
The following screenshot shows the MicroChart Table component:
Visit the Inovista website (http://www.inovista.com/) for more 
information on the Tree and Data Grid components and the individual 
components in the Micro Chart Suite. Here you can also find the other

Integrating Web Intelligence with Antivia 
XWIS Advantage Express
Antivia XWIS Advantage Express is an add-on by Antivia that lets us connect to Web 
Intelligence documents, Crystal Reports, and even SQL databases and OLAP cubes. 
Also, it comes with a large set of components to display and analyze the retrieved data.
As we have seen in Chapter 8, Dashboard Data Connectivity, SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards is already able to connect to a number of data sources. This recipe will show you 
some of the capabilities of Antivia XWIS Advantage Express and the advantages it has over 
the standard connection types.
Getting ready
Go to the Antivia website (http://www.antivia.com/xwis-advantage-express/) and 
download the free 50-name user license. This recipe won't discuss the server-side installations 
for the Antivia framework that are required to run Antivia XWIS Advantage Express.
How to do it...
1.	 Open a new SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file and add the Antivia Connect 
component to the canvas. This component controls the user authentication and 
generates a session token. In every Antivia XWIS data component that we are 
going to use, we need to bind this token.
2.	 Set up the spreadsheet as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 10
329
3.	 Bind the five fields of the General tab of the properties pane to the corresponding 
cells in the spreadsheet.
4.	 Fill in your Username and Password in the Design time connection section 
and click on Connect.
5.	 Add an XWIS Table component to the canvas.
6.	 First bind the Session Token field to cell B6.

column by clicking on its label. Now leave the Preview mode.
11.	 Add a Pie Chart and a Line Chart component to the canvas.
12.	Return to the Content tab of the XWIS Table component. Select the 
AutoWire sub-tab.
13.	Select both the Enable AutoWire and Manage layout options.
14.	 Also select AutoWire for these charts only.

Chapter 10

15.	Select the Bind option for both chart components and also select the Layout 
option for the Pie Chart component.
16.	 Preview the dashboard to see what happens.

Top Third-party Add-ons

17.	 As you can see, the XWIS Table component now has two little symbols in its upper 
right-hand side. If you click on the pie chart symbol, the table will be replaced with 
the Pie Chart component. Click on this symbol.
18.	Click on a slice of the pie chart to drill down.
How it works...
In this recipe, we showed you only a few of the possibilities of Antivia XWIS Advantage Express. 
One thing should be clear already: setting up an interactive dashboard that is capable of 
displaying and drilling through a large set of data is made very easy with this add-on.
The Antivia Service URL, username, password, and session token need to be bound to 
the spreadsheet; the BI System can be selected or bound. When connecting to a SAP 
BusinessObjects environment, your username and password are your SAP BusinessObjects 
credentials.
The XWIS Table component enables us to analyze a very large set of data (30,000+ rows) 
from within a dashboard, without the need to configure multiple data connections with QaaWS 
or Live Office, set up the spreadsheet, and define the bindings to a component. This is a huge 
efficiency gain!
We demonstrated the AutoWire feature that makes dashboard development even easier 
and faster because it completely takes care of the binding of data to standard SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards chart components. If you still want to bind the data 
to the spreadsheet, Antivia XWIS Advantage Express also provides this feature.

Chapter 10
335
There's more...
Antivia XWIS Advantage Express comes with a large number of components, which we will 
discuss in this section.
XWIS Slice and Dice component
The XWIS Slice and Dice component lets the dashboard user create their own report layout. 
The user can use drag-and-drop to configure the report from a set of available objects. The 
following screenshot shows the interface where the user gets to do this:
XWIS Export component
The XWIS Export component enables us to export data from the dashboard to MS Excel 
files, which is an extremely powerful option. The button gives us two options—exporting the 
complete dataset or exporting the data as shown in the components.

336
Alerts
In all data-based Antivia XWIS components, alerts can be used to highlight cells when a certain 
condition is met. A nice feature here is that these alert definitions are stored in the Antivia XWIS 
repository, so they can be reused in other components or even in other dashboards.
Antivia Timer component
The Antivia Timer component is the only component that can work independently and does 
not need a session token to run. It writes the current time to a cell at a defined interval. This 
component can be useful to trigger components with the Refresh on change option or in 
combination with Dynamic Visibility.

Advanced printing with Xcelsius Dashboard 
Printer
The standard Print Button component in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards has pretty basic 
functionality: it prints your dashboard as it is displayed on the screen. It's all or nothing; you 
can't select a specific part of the dashboard. The only setting you can make is whether the 
dashboard should be scaled to fit the page or to a certain percentage. When you click the 
button, the default Windows Print window appears and you can start printing.
The Xcelsius Dashboard Printer add-on by DataSavvyTools has a lot more options. It lets the 
user select a portion of the dashboard, queue up multiple snapshots before printing, format 
the output, and add annotations. Instead of printing, it can also send the screenshot to the 
clipboard or save as a file.
Getting ready
You can find the Xcelsius Dashboard Printer add-on at the DataSavvyTools website, 
http://www.datasavvytools.com/.
How to do it...
1.	 Open an existing SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file.
2.	 Add the Xcelsius Dashboard Printer component to the dashboard. 
Actually, you're pretty much done setting up the component right now.
3.	 Hit the Preview button or export the dashboard to an SWF file.

Besides adding a queue of screenshots and saving them to local files or directly sending them 
to a printer, the component also allows you to make annotations to the screenshots before 
saving or printing them.

SUCCESS with graphomate charts
The charts in the graphomate add-on are based on the SUCCESS rules for data visualization 
and business communication, compiled by Rolf Hichert. A known pitfall when developing 
dashboards is that a dashboard can consist of colorful and shiny pie charts that are nice to 
look at but not always that effective to use. A dashboard should present data in such a way 
that the users can perform effective analysis, compare values, and quickly see what is good 
or bad. For more information on the SUCCESS principle by Hichert, check http://www.
hichert.com/en/success.
The graphomate add-on charts include six charts: Bar & Column, Needle, Deviation, Line, 
Stacked, and Waterfall. Compared to the standard charts in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards, 
these charts tend to look a bit minimalistic and clean with no axes and little color, but they can 
help you to create really useful dashboards.
Getting ready
Go to the graphomate website and request a trial at http://www.graphomate.com/en/
contact_trial/. We will use a very simple dataset for this recipe, as shown in the 
following screenshot:
How to do it...
1.	 Open a new empty SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards file.
2.	 Add the graphomate Chart component to the canvas.
3.	 Go to the properties pane and enter the serial number you got when requesting the 
trial. This will activate the component and you'll see a chart appearing.

In this recipe, we quickly set up a Deviation chart from the graphomate charts add-on. 
We compared data over two years with their quarterly target values. The final chart provides 
both the nominal deviation from the target as well as the percentage. This makes it easy to 
find out which period did best and worst. The double category label option made it easy to 
add years to the x-axis without cluttering it with a lot of recurring values.

This recipe only showed a very basic setup of a graphomate charts add-on chart. As we 
have seen, there are in total six chart types that can be used in both a horizontal and 
vertical orientation. The charts can be completely customized to the finest details. Visit the

Introduction
When we create a dashboard, we want users to have the best experience possible. The faster 
the dashboard starts up, the better it is. When a selection is made and data needs to be 
refreshed, we want the charts and tables in the dashboard to change as soon as possible. A 
dashboard that performs poorly usually gets discarded by users because they consider it slow 
and unusable. As a general rule, we would say that a dashboard needs to load and refresh in 
a maximum time of 8 seconds.
It can be a difficult job to fix a slow dashboard since a lot of different factors can influence 
performance. The fact is that a lower number of the following points will result in better 
performance:

In this chapter, we will look into several topics that can help you optimize the usability of 
your dashboard.
Improving Excel spreadsheet performance
Excel is an extremely powerful tool containing many useful calculation functions. However, 
some of these functions consume a lot of CPU power, thus slowing down the performance 
of a dashboard.
If you are a user who works with a lot of complicated Excel reports, you will most likely 
experience that some Excel reports take a very long time to recalculate whenever any 
data is changed within any of the spreadsheets.
How to do it…
Here are some tips with workarounds to improve Excel performance:
f
f
Work from left to right: By default, Excel will first calculate expressions at the top-left 
corner of the spreadsheet and then continue to the right and downwards. Because 
of this, it is best to put expressions that are referencing to values in other cells to the 
right or to the bottom of those referenced cells. This is called forward referencing. 
With a small worksheet it won't make much of a difference, but for very large 
worksheets it will.
f
f
Avoid using volatile functions: Some examples of volatile functions are RAND(), 
RANDBETWEEN(), NOW(), TODAY(), OFFSET(), CELL(), and INDIRECT(). The 
issue with using volatile functions is that they will recalculate every time a change 
is made in a worksheet. For example, if you change cell A1 from X to Y, the RAND() 
function in cell A2 will recalculate and display another value. Note that some of 
these functions such as RANDBETWEEN() don't even work with SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards during runtime.

Chapter 11
347
f
f
Avoid array formulas: Formulas such as SUMIF(), COUNTIF(), AVERAGEIF(), 
VLOOKUP, and HLOOKUP are memory hogs especially when the arrays are very large. 
If possible, replace SUMIF(), COUNTIF(), and AVERAGEIF() with regular formulas. 
VLOOKUP() and HLOOKUP() can be replaced with the Filtered rows component 
found in Chapter 3, From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard, or with a combination 
of MATCH() and INDEX().
f
f
Avoid giant formulas: Complex formulas that are very large should either be 
completed on the database side, or in a Web Intelligence (Webi) report (see the 
following recipe), or a BEx query when possible. This puts the load on the server, 
which has a lot more horsepower than the client machine.
Using scheduled Webis to save on querying 
time
As mentioned in Chapter 8, Dashboard Data Connectivity, being able to schedule Web 
Intelligence (Webi) reports instead of running live queries for each and every query will 
help improve performance drastically.
Let's take an example where it takes two minutes to execute a query. If we were to have the 
dataset prescheduled instead of running live, we could retrieve the data in seconds rather 
than minutes.
There will be people who complain that your database architecture or query strategy is 
incorrect if it takes two minutes to execute a query. However, a lot of times it is impossible 
to speed up a query due to the sheer size of data or the amount of work it would take to 
re-architect the entire data warehouse.
Getting ready
Create a Webi document. In our example, we will create a simple Webi from the eFashion 
Universe that contains a crosstab with months as columns and stores as rows. Also, make 
sure that you have a Live Office connection as well as a BI Web Services connection created 
based on the Webi document.

Performance Tuning
348
How to do it…
1.	 Create a schedule for your Webi to execute from BI Launchpad. In our example, we 
will have the Webi refresh daily at 8 a.m.
2.	 In the Live Office connection, modify the properties so that we refresh based on the 
latest instance.

Chapter 11
349
3.	 On the BI Web Services connection from the Data Manager, set the 
getFromLatestDocumentInstance property to 1.
When you test the BI Web Service, the boolean properties work based 
on TRUE/FALSE. However, in the SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards 
Data Manager, you need to use 1/0, otherwise it will not work.
How it works…
As you can see, all we need to do to use scheduled Webis is to first schedule the Webi 
document, and then set the refresh on the latest instance properties of either your 
Live Office or BI Web Services connection to true.

Running connections after loading the 
dashboard
When you run a dashboard, the initialization message and a loading bar is shown. When 
initialization is finished the message disappears and the dashboard is presented and made 
available for usage.
During initialization, all dashboard connections and queries are loaded by default when the 
Refresh Before Components Are Loaded option in the Usage tab of the Data Manager is set. 
This means that when you have one or more connections that require some time to load, the 
whole dashboard has to wait for them to finish. Only when all data is loaded is the initialization 
message removed and the dashboard can be used. Why not let users see the dashboard 
immediately and let it fill with data as soon as a connection has finished loading? Luckily, 
there is a workaround for this issue, as we will see in this recipe.
Getting ready
Use a dashboard with one or more Data Manager connections or Queries Browser queries.
How to do it…
1.	 For the connection, go to the Data Manager, select the connection, and choose 
the Usage tab.
2.	 For the query, select the query in the Query Browser, select Edit, and go to the 
Usage Options.

Chapter 11
351
Uncheck Refresh Before Components Are Loaded in the Data Manager...
…or in the Query Browser:
3.	 Now add a Refresh button. Add a Connection Refresh Button component for the 
connection or a Query Refresh Button component for the query to the canvas.

Performance Tuning
352
4.	 In the General tab of the Refresh button, select the connections or queries you want 
to load.
5.	 Now go to the Behavior tab and check the Refresh After Components Are 
Loaded option.
You can also bind the Trigger Cell to a spreadsheet cell here to refresh 
the connections or queries when the bound cell value changes.

Chapter 11
353
6.	 Since we only use this component to initially load the data after the dashboard 
components are loaded, we want to hide this component. Go to the Appearance 
tab and uncheck the Show Button Background option.
7.	
Go to the Text tab and uncheck the Label option.
We set up the Connection Refresh Button and Query Refresh Button 
components here as automated background components, as we actually 
don't need the dashboard user to click and activate it. When the user 
accidentally moves over the component, the cursor will turn into a hand 
symbol, indicating a clickable action. To avoid this you could minimize 
the size of the component and locate it behind a logo or another part of 
the dashboard that is unlikely to be clicked.
How it works…
With this option, the dashboard components load and show up before the data loading is 
finished. This is more appealing to the user as they can see something happening instead 
of watching the dull initialization message. We can also use this to initially load only the 
data that is required for the first or initial screen of the dashboard, while the other data 
(that even might require some more time to load) is loaded in the background or only 
after a user triggers it.

Checking master data loading performance 
of connections
When data is loaded or refreshed, the associated connections are executed in parallel by 
default. This is a great feature because it dramatically reduces the total loading time of 
the dashboard.
To check the loading state of all your connections, it is a good practice to create a custom 
debug mode that lets you monitor how the connections are performing.
Getting ready
Use a dashboard with multiple connections.
How to do it…
1.	 Add a Spreadsheet Table component to the canvas.
2.	 Set up the spreadsheet as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 Go to the Data Manager and select the Usage tab. Here you'll find a section called 
Load Status. For each connection, bind the Insert In field to the corresponding 
spreadsheet cell.

Chapter 11
355
4.	 Bind the Spreadsheet Table component to the spreadsheet area.
5.	 Publish and Launch the dashboard and see what happens while the connections 
are executed.
You can use Dynamic Visibility to make the Spreadsheet Table component appear and 
disappear when required. Read Chapter 4, Dynamic Visibility, to learn more about this feature.

There's more…
As we have seen in the Using the SAP NetWeaver BW Connection recipe in Chapter 8, 
Dashboard Data Connectivity, we can use the same BEx query that provides the transaction 
data (the result set) to load the master data values. These master data values are mostly 
used to fill up the labels of selection components. A connection with such a setup has, of 
course, a longer execution time, since more data has to be loaded.
If you are using only one of the connections to load the master data values for multiple 
characteristics, this connection could slow down the overall loading performance in case of 
a lot of available master data. A solution would be to divide the loading of the master data 
values over multiple connections. Let's say you need to load all values for the characteristics, 
calendar year, country, and project into your dashboard spreadsheet, to fill the labels for three 
selection components. You also have multiple connections in the Data Manager that all use 
the same dataset as a source. You then could load the calendar year values from connection 
1, the values for country from connection 2, and the values for project from connection 3.
Make sure that the connection that you use can functionally deliver 
the same master data values. This is, for example, the case when 
they have the same source and they have the same master data 
value settings defined in the BEx Query.
You could even consider creating a specific, separate connection for the loading of (a part of 
the) master data values.
Experiment with different scenarios to find out which setup gives the 
best overall performance results.
Optimizing BEx Query performance
In this recipe, we will give you some specific performance optimization recommendations 
when using BEx Queries as a data source for your data connection. Standard SAP BW 
optimization practices like InfoCube design, using aggregates, OLAP caching, and so 
on have not been covered here, as it is too general and out of the scope of this book.
How to do it…
We will discuss three topics here.

Chapter 11
357
Use dashboard specific queries
Do not reuse existing queries that are used for reporting with analysis tools, such as BEx 
Analyzer, SAP BusinessObjects Web Intelligence, or SAP BusinessObjects Analysis. These 
queries tend to have a broad setup with lots of (free) characteristics and key figures, whereas 
for a dashboard, extremely specific queries are required. The dashboard queries should 
provide a result set with only the data that is required, and nothing more.
Also, do not use BEx Query Views. Instead, if you want to reuse an initial query and change 
its structure, make use of the Data Preview tab of the Data Manager.
Use the BEx Query Designer features
The SAP BW environment is highly optimized for query execution, so make sure you do all 
calculation and summarization in the query and not in the dashboard. Avoid using an Excel 
formula whenever you can create the same outcome in the BEx Query. So, if you need a 
column total or average, use the features of the BEx Query Designer to add a total row 
or an additional formula or selection to your output. If you need a specific, complex key 
figure calculation, let the BEx Query take care of that. Do not make these calculations with 
Excel formulas, as this will increase the size of your dashboard and decrease its loading 
performance greatly.
Also, for data filtering options you can use the BEx Query Designer. It has tons of options for 
custom input variables, with offsets and even user and default SAP exits, which let the SAP 
BW system do the complex calculations of the required values. An example is the selection 
of the year-to-date period range until the previous month. In addition to this, you can use 
Text variables to create dynamic labels.
Only use and reload necessary (master) data
It sounds pretty obvious, but you do not want to reload all connections every time a selection 
is made. Try to set up a smart system to reload only those connections that provide data for 
parts of the dashboard that are used and displayed at the time of data refreshment. Use 
trigger cells to set this up.
Make sure you only bind the master data values for the characteristics that you actually are 
using in the dashboard (for example, to fill the labels of selection component). Only for those 
characteristics that have Output Values from the Value Help section bound to a spreadsheet 
cell range are the values retrieved.
We can reduce the amount of master data values by making smart selections in the BEx 
Query. In case you only need the last five years of data, add a (variable) selection on the year 
characteristic in the Global Filter in the BEx Query Designer. Now for the time characteristics 
only master data values for the last five years will show up in the dashboard.

Performance Tuning
358
Also, if the master data values that are provided by the BEx Query are static, it doesn't make 
sense to load them each time the connection is refreshed. If this negatively influences the 
loading performance too much, you could consider the creation of a separate connection to 
load these master data values only once.
Using Fiddler to identify the cause of 
performance issues
Dashboards can become quite complex as it is very common to have multiple queries executing 
at once, especially during the initial load. When we encounter performance issues, it is very 
difficult to pinpoint exactly where the issue is coming from. Fortunately, we can use the Fiddler 
tool to help us identify the root cause of a performance-related issue.
Getting ready
Download Fiddler from http://www.telerik.com/download/fiddler. Create a simple 
dashboard that contains one query and one chart. In our example, we created a query that 
contains the Calendar Year dimension and Sales Amount measure. The data is then plotted 
on a Column Chart.

Chapter 11
359
How to do it…
1.	 Make sure Fiddler is running and then Preview your dashboard.
2.	 In Fiddler you will notice that there are three lines on the left-hand side window. 
The first line and last line are session initialization and session ending items. 
The second line is our query process. The way we can tell this is that query 
requests have the URL /dswsbobje/services/XcelsiusWebServices.

Performance Tuning
360
3.	 Now let's analyze the query. Click on the Statistics tab on the right-hand side window. 
Here you can see the performance of the query being executed. In our example, the 
query executes in 0.389 seconds. In a real-life scenario, you would have to go through 
each of your queries and figure out which query is performing poorly.

Chapter 11
361
4.	 Now let's learn how to retrieve some more useful information about this query 
request. Click on the Inspectors tab and you will notice a top window and bottom 
window. The top window is the request and the bottom window is the response. 
We are interested in the response. Generally, it is preferable to look at the XML 
result in WebView. Click on WebView and then click on the bar above, which 
says Response is encoded … Click here to transform.

Performance Tuning
362
5.	 We can see some interesting information about the query now. First, if you look at the 
highlighted area at the bottom, you will see that it is the query that returns the result 
containing the Calendar Year dimension and Amount measure. The highlighted 
area on the top contains the SQL statement from the query being executed. Using 
this information, we can figure out if a bad query has been caused by inefficient 
SQL query generation.
How it works…
Fiddler helps capture all the HTTP(S) traffic between the user running the dashboard and 
the SAP BusinessObjects server that we are communicating with. In our example, we perform 
some analysis on the communication between the server and client when a query is executed. 
We track performance by looking at the Statistics and when we want to dive deeper, we can 
look at the Request and Response in detail.

Chapter 11
363
There's more…
Not only can we monitor performance of our dashboards with Fiddler, we can see in detail if 
there are any web server errors such as the common 404 not found error.
We can even modify and manipulate requests and responses by setting break points during 
runtime. For example, we can compose our own HTTP request, run it through Fiddler, and then 
receive a response from the server.
Finally, Fiddler has a rich extensibility model that ranges from a simple FiddlerScript to powerful 
extensions, which can be developed using any .NET language.

Fixing corrupt XLF files
Introduction
Developing a dashboard with SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards can be fun at times, but it is 
important to work efficiently. Doing unnecessary and repetitive tasks can be very frustrating.
In this chapter, we will go through a bunch of tips and tricks to increase your productivity when 
developing a dashboard. We will show you how to debug a dashboard and how you can recover 
your work in the unfortunate case your XLF file gets corrupted.
Using the Spreadsheet Table component 
to debug
When developing dashboards, there will always come a time when you are totally stumped 
on why something is not working correctly. Refer to spreadsheet debugger.xlf to follow 
the example.

Increasing Productivity 
366
Getting ready
In our example, we will illustrate a simple bug and how to find its cause. Our example contains 
a drop-down control that populates a chart with preloaded data.
We've purposely populated the data area incorrectly ahead of time where we've accidentally 
forgotten to map an extra column on the row output. In reality, we won't know that the data 
has been incorrectly populated.

Chapter 12
367
How to do it…
1.	 Execute the dashboard. You will notice that the data looks off on the dropdown and 
the chart.
2.	 Insert a Spreadsheet Table component anywhere on the dashboard.
3.	 Map the spreadsheet to the area that is populated by the data.

Increasing Productivity 
368
4.	 Execute the dashboard. You will see that the data looks okay. There's data under 
China. So let's see what the output of the drop-down selector is.
5.	 Bind the spreadsheet table to the output area of the drop-down selector.
6.	 Execute the dashboard and you will see that China's data is missing from the 
dropdown selector output. Now you know that you will have to fix the dropdown 
selector binding.

Chapter 12
369
How it works…
As you can see, using the Spreadsheet Table component is very helpful in seeing what 
is happening under the hood. In this example, you can easily oversee a large area of data. 
If we were to try to debug by figuring out which component is causing the issue, it would take 
much longer as we would have to go through the Dropdown component, Chart component, 
and Data Connection in order to find the culprit. This is a simple example, but just imagine 
if there were a lot more components involved.
Time-saving tips during dashboard 
development
Developing dashboards can be very tedious. So we wanted to provide you with a set of time-
saving tips that will make your life a lot easier.
How to do it…
In this big How to do it… section we will cover all tips for this recipe.
Global Fonts
1.	 It is always a best practice to use a Global Font. This way, the font is consistent 
throughout the dashboard. Each time a component is inserted into the dashboard, 
it will use the font set in the Global Fonts setting.
2.	 To set a Global Font, click on File | Document Properties….

Increasing Productivity 
370
Note that the font should be available on the local machine of each 
dashboard user, otherwise the developer will need to embed the font. 
This is unadvisable due to size and resolution issues with Adobe Flash. 
Thus, try not to use exotic fonts.
Grouping from the Object Browser versus grouping with a 
Canvas Container
When grouping components, you can either group directly from the Object Browser or 
you can insert a Canvas Container and then drop the objects you want grouped inside 
the Canvas Container.
Here are some pros and cons of both:
f
f
Grouping objects directly: This is the quickest and easiest way to group objects. 
However, if you want to move or resize objects within the group, you will need to 
ungroup everything, adjust the position/size of the objects, and then regroup the 
objects. You will also need to rename the group again. In addition, if you want 
to add objects to a group that has Dynamic Visibility set, you will need to manually 
add Dynamic Visibility onto the new object in the grouping. Finally, when you ungroup 
and then regroup objects, you will risk running into human errors (setting Dynamic 
Visibility, layering, and so on).
f
f
Grouping objects using a Canvas Container: This method requires that a user inserts 
a Canvas Container onto the dashboard, and then drops the grouped objects into 
it. The benefit here is that you do not have to worry about setting Dynamic Visibility 
when dropping new objects into the container. In addition, you do not have to ungroup 
the objects when you want to move or resize the objects. A minor issue with Canvas 
Containers is that you see the dotted lines around the canvas in the development 
screen, which is only a minor inconvenience. Also, you will see that the inside of the 
canvas is shaded so you will not be able to see what the true color looks like during 
runtime. Finally, using Canvas Containers may increase  the file size of your dashboard.

Chapter 12
371
Editing multiple components at once
This is a very useful feature. For example, you may have three bar charts and want to resize 
all the title fonts. Instead of resizing each one individually, you can select each one by holding 
Ctrl and clicking on each chart from the dashboard canvas, or holding Ctrl and clicking on 
each chart from the Object Browser. You will now be able to edit items that are common 
to all the charts (such as the Appearance tab).

Increasing Productivity 
372
Using the alignment, sizing, and spacing buttons
As mentioned in Chapter 7, Dashboard Look and Feel, creating a dashboard that is neatly 
aligned with charts and components of similar sizing provides a cleaner user experience. 
Accomplishing this can be a very tedious task when there are many objects involved. Just 
imagine slowly resizing, aligning, and spacing each and every object manually. Fortunately, 
we can resize, space, and align objects easily using some of the helpful toolbar functions 
as shown in the following screenshot:
For example, if you wanted to resize the following bar chart to be exactly the same as the line 
chart and align the top so that it is equal as well, you would do the following:
1.	 First, select the master object that you want the other objects to follow. In this 
case, hold Ctrl and select the bar chart first. Then, keep holding Ctrl and select 
each subsequent object (in this case, the line chart).
2.	 Click on the equal make same size icon. Sometimes, you might want to make 
objects the same height or width, but in our case, it's both.

Chapter 12
373
3.	 Click on the Align Top icon so that the bar chart becomes aligned with the line chart 
on the left.
Always remember that the first object selected controls the sizing 
and alignment of subsequent objects.

Increasing Productivity 
374
Using the arrow keys for precise placement of components
The alignment functions are great for moving components so that they are exactly aligned 
with one another. However, there are cases when we may want to move a particular object 
to an exact location. In most cases, we can drag with the mouse, but it is difficult to drag a 
component to the exact pixel for pinpoint accuracy.
Thus, what a user can do is first drag the component close to the exact position of choice. 
Then, they can use the arrow keys to slowly move the object to the exact pixel.
Using the Grid to help with relative positioning
The Grid is a helpful mechanism to visually aid developers on the exact pixel location of 
components. To turn on the Grid, navigate to View | Grid.
You can also set the sizing of each Grid as well as the option to snap objects to the Grid when 
moving objects around. To set the Grid options, click on File | Preferences | Grid.

Chapter 12
375
Copying objects from another dashboard
Templates are a great way of reusing components such as headers, footers, and color schemes 
over and over without having to recreate them on every dashboard. However, there are cases 
where certain charts, selectors, and buttons may be needed in some dashboards.
One neat feature that SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards has is the ability to have another SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards instance open, and then copy the objects from that dashboard 
to another dashboard currently in development. This is useful if there is formatting and cell 
binding that can be reused. If there were 20 reusable objects, for example, this would save us 
a great deal of time by copying and pasting the components instead of recreating each one.

Increasing Productivity 
376
If you want to copy the cell binding of the objects from one dashboard 
to another, make sure that you also copy the worksheet; otherwise, 
you will lose all the cell bindings.
Fixing corrupt XLF files
Unfortunately, sometimes the XLF file gets corrupted, and when this happens, it is obviously 
never at a good time. The problem is that it is not exactly clear why and when this happens, 
so it is hard to prevent this from happening at all. The only thing we know is that the more 
components and Excel logic used in a dashboard model, the higher the chance is of this 
happening. Also, using MS Excel and SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards at the same time 
can cause trouble.
When an XLF file is corrupt, the following error message is given when the file is loading or 
when you are working on it:

Chapter 12
377
Older versions of SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards (Xcelsius) show the following message: 
An error occurred while communicating with Microsoft Excel. To prevent further data 
corruption, Xcelsius must close. After clicking the OK button, SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards exits.
A best practice is to create a lot of (local) backups of the dashboard you are working on. 
Try to save a copy for every 30 or 60 minutes of work, or after making a bunch of changes. 
Do this consistently! You can use a simple incremental file name strategy to tell the files apart. 
For example, use the date and time of the backup at the end of the file name (dashboard_
name_201411201556.xlf, dashboard_name_201411201623.xlf), or just use an 
incremental number with each backup file (dashboard_name_001.xlf, dashboard_
name_002.xlf).
When a corruption error occurs, you can revert to the last working backup. If this doesn't work 
or isn't possible, you can try this recipe where we will try to replace the corrupt Excel file.
Getting ready
We need a corrupt XLF file.
How to do it…
1.	 Make a copy of the corrupted XLF file.
2.	 Rename the extension (.xlf) of the file as .zip. You will get a Windows message 
about changing the extension, which could cause the file to be unusable. Click Yes.
3.	 Open the ZIP file. Here you will see a folder and two documents. In the folder, the 
images of the dashboard model are saved. If you don't use images, you won't see 
this folder. In the document.xml file, the dashboard model properties are stored 
(component size, position, and so on). The xldoc file is the spreadsheet model.

Increasing Productivity 
378
4.	 Drag the xldoc file out of the ZIP file.
5.	 Rename the xldoc file as xldoc.xls.
6.	 Open xldoc.xls in MS Excel. As you can see in the following screenshot, there are 
a lot of #VALUE errors in the spreadsheet file.
7.	
Save the file as an Excel Workbook file (xldoc.xlsx). Close MS Excel.
8.	 Now reopen MS Excel and load the XLSX file you just created. Save it as an 
Excel 97-2003 Workbook file (xldoc.xls).
9.	 Rename xldoc.xls back to xldoc.
10.	 Go back to the ZIP file and delete the xldoc file from it.
11.	 Drag your edited xldoc file into the ZIP file.
12.	Rename the ZIP file back to XLF.
13.	Open the dashboard model in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards.
You might need to repair some cells in the spreadsheet, but at least you can access your 
dashboard model again.
How it works…
Corrupt files are a big frustration among SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards developers. 
This unofficial workaround might solve the issue by hacking into the XLF file and replacing 
the spreadsheet source file. Use this method only when necessary.

Chapter 12
379
There's more…
Instead of using the xldoc file from the corrupted XLF file, you can also replace it with the 
xldoc file from a recent backup XLF file. When you do this, make sure that there aren't too 
many changes to your spreadsheet or bindings with the dashboard components.

adjustable variables.
We will use techniques from the following chapters and recipes:

As we are starting from scratch, you only have to open a new SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboard file.

Appendix A
383
How to do it...
1.	 The dashboard will contain four variables: Mortgage amount, Mortgage term in 
years, Yearly interest rate, and a variable that states whether the mortgage will be 
paid off by equal monthly payments (annuity) or just at the end of the mortgage term, 
which is the Monthly interest rate.
2.	 First, set up the spreadsheet. Make sure your spreadsheet looks like the 
following screenshot:
3.	 To calculate the monthly and total payments, we need the mortgage term in months, 
which is the number of years multiplied by 12. Add this Excel formula to cell 
B3: =B2*12.
4.	 To calculate the monthly interest rate, we need the formula =(1+B4)^(1/12)-1. 
Enter it into cell B5.
Instead of using the ^ operator, you can also use the POWER 
Excel formula: =POWER(1+B4,1/12)-1.
5.	 Now drag three Horizontal Slider components to the canvas.
6.	 Bind the Data field of the first Horizontal Slider component to cell B1. Also set the 
Maximum Limit to 1,000,000. Enter Mortgage as the Title.
7.	
Select the second Horizontal Slider component and bind its Data field to cell B4. Set 
the Maximum Limit to 0.1. As we are dealing with percentages, the maximum limit 
is now 10% due to this setting. Enter Interest rate as the Title.
8.	 Go to the Behavior tab, and in the Slider Movement section, change the Increment 
to 0.001.

Real-world Dashboard Case Studies
384
9.	 Select the third Horizontal Slider component and bind the Data field of this one to 
cell B2. Set the Maximum Limit to 30 and enter Period (years) as the Title.
10.	 Now we need to add some more logic to our spreadsheet to calculate the monthly 
payments. Adjust your spreadsheet as shown in the following screenshot:
11.	 Enter the following formula in cell B8 to calculate the monthly annuity:
=B1*(B5/(1-(1+B5)^(-B3)))
12.	Enter the formula =B3*B8 in cell B9 to calculate the total amount.
13.	Enter the formula =B9-B1 in cell B10 to calculate the total interest amount.
14.	 In cell C8, enter the formula =B1*(B4^1/12) to calculate the monthly amount, 
which is only the interest.

Appendix A
385
15.	Enter formula =B3*C8 in cell C10 and enter formula =B1+C10 in cell C9.
16.	 Add a Combo Box component to the canvas. We will use this component to 
determine whether the mortgage will be paid off in monthly installments. Bind the 
Labels field to cells B7 and C7. Go to the Behavior tab and set Item to Label 1.
17.	 Return to the General tab, and in the Data Insertion section, set the Insertion Type 
to Column. Bind the Source Data field to cell range B8:C10. Bind the Destination 
field to cell range D8:D10.
18.	Finally, enter Monthly pay off? as the Title.
19.	Go back to the spreadsheet and enter the formula =B1 into cell D11.
20.	Now that the spreadsheet and all the selectors are set up, it is time to show some 
data in the dashboard. Add a Gauge component to the canvas.
21.	 Bind its By Range field to cell D8 and set the Maximum Limit field to 5000. Enter 
Monthly amount as the Title.
22.	Add another Gauge component to the canvas and bind its By Range field to cell D9. 
Set its Maximum Limit field to 10,000,000. Enter Total amount as the Title.

Real-world Dashboard Case Studies
386
23.	Drag a Pie Chart component to the canvas. Bind its Values field to cells D10 and 
D11. Next, bind the Labels field to cells A10 and A11. Enter Division total 
amount as the Title.
24.	 Go to the Appearance tab and deselect Show Chart Background. Set the position of 
the legend to Bottom.
25.	All right! The what-if section of the dashboard is now in place and ready to be tested. 
Preview the dashboard and play around with the sliders and selectors to see if 
everything works.
26.	Leave the Preview mode. We will now adjust the layout of the dashboard so it looks a 
bit smoother.
27.	 First select the Phase theme from the Theme selector in the Format menu.
28.	Use the Alignment options from the Format menu to adjust the placement of the 
three sliders and the selector.
You can also use the Grid to help with alignment and positioning. 
You can activate the Grid in Preferences in the File menu.

Appendix A
387
29.	Add a Rectangular component and resize it so it will fit over the sliders and selector. 
Change the Border Color into a lighter color; for example, gray.
30.	Add a Label component to the canvas and enter Mortgage Calculator in the 
Enter Text field. Select the Appearance tab and go to the Text sub-tab. Select Bold 
and set the Text Size to 28. Make sure you resize the Label component if the text 
doesn't fit anymore.
31.	 Select the Pie Chart and the Gauge components. Align them by Middle and Space 
Evenly Across.

Real-world Dashboard Case Studies
388
32.	As you can see, the title of the Pie Chart is placed a bit higher than the titles of the 
Gauge components. Select both Gauge components. Go to the Appearance tab 
and select the Text sub-tab. Now adjust the Y Offset so all titles will have the 
same height.
33.	Select Value. In the Format Selected Text section, select Bold and adjust the Y 
Offset so the values of the Gauge components will be at the same height as the 
legend of the Pie Chart component.
34.	Go to the Behavior tab and deselect the Enable Interaction option.
35.	Add another Rectangular component to the canvas and place it over the Gauge 
components and Pie Chart.

Appendix A
389
36.	Select Fit the Canvas to Components from the Canvas Sizing options in the View 
menu. You can also use the buttons from the Standard Toolbar. Select the Increase 
Canvas option twice.
37.	 Your what-if dashboard is complete!

Getting ready
It is important that you have the Sales_Profit.xlf file as a reference. Please open it 
before proceeding to the next section as the spreadsheet layout has already been completed 
for your convenience.
How to do it...
1.	 Drag the Map – USA component onto the canvas.
2.	 Bind the Region Keys to the State Keys on the Control Sheet tab.
3.	 In the Data Insertion section, select Row as the Insertion Type. The Source Data will 
be the keys that we selected in step 2. The Destination will be cell E1.

Real-world Dashboard Case Studies
392
4.	 Bind Display Data to the key-value pair items in the Map Display worksheet.
5.	 Go to the Alerts properties, check the Enable Alerts checkbox, select By Value, 
check the Use a Range checkbox, and bind to the range section in the Map Display 
worksheet. It is important that you bind starting at 2500, otherwise it will add another 
range starting from minimum to 0.

Appendix A
393
6.	 The next step is to complete the YTD chart in the top right-hand corner. Drag a Bar 
Chart component and place it in the top right-hand corner of the canvas.
7.	
Bind the Titles to the appropriate cells in column T of the State and Drilldown 
Display worksheet. Then bind the Data to the cells V3:W7. The data in V4:W7 is 
populated depending on whether a user selects Sales or Profit. Note that the cells 
are pre-populated with test data.

Real-world Dashboard Case Studies
394
8.	 Go to the Insertion properties of the YTD Chart. Check the Enable Data Insertion 
checkbox and select Row as the Insertion Type. Bind the Source Data to cells 
A4:Q7 of the State and Drilldown Display worksheet. Bind the Destination to cells 
A14:Q14. Note that the cells are pre-populated with test data.
9.	 The next step is to complete the scorecard in the middle right-hand side of the 
dashboard. Drag a Scorecard component onto the canvas.
10.	 Bind Display Data to cells M13:Q14 of the Drilldown Scorecard section in the State 
and Drilldown Display worksheet. These cells are the drilldown values populated 
from the YTD Chart in step 8.

Appendix A
395
11.	 Go to the Appearance properties of the Scorecard and click on the Text tab. 
Unselect the Target Profit and YTD vs Last YTD checkboxes. The reason is 
that we only want to see alert shapes on these cells and not the text value.
12.	Go to the Alerts properties of the Scorecard. Check the Target Profit and YTD vs 
Last YTD checkboxes. In both cases, the Alert Values will be bound to cell O14 of the 
State and Drilldown Display worksheet. In both cases, make sure to have As Percent 
of Target selected. Bind Target Profit to cell P14 and YTD vs Last YTD to cell Q14. In 
the Alert Thresholds section, we want Min/70%/85%/Max for Target Profit. Set the 
alert threshold for the YTD vs Last YTD to Min/99.999%/100%/Max.
The reason why we have 99.999% is so that the yellow arrow 
symbolizes anything that has YTD equal to Last YTD.

Real-world Dashboard Case Studies
396
13.	Next, we will complete the trend line chart in the bottom right-hand corner of the 
dashboard. Drag a Line Chart component and place it in the bottom right-hand 
corner of the canvas.
14.	 Bind Titles and Data Range to the appropriate section in the State and Drilldown 
Display worksheet.
Note that the purple section is populated depending on whether 
a user selects Sales or Profit.
15.	Now that the display elements are in place, we'll move on to the Sales/Profit 
Radio selector. Drag a Radio Button selector and place it in the top left section 
of the canvas.

Appendix A
397
16.	 There are two sets of data bindings here. First, we will select Label as Insertion Type 
and then bind the data to the selected label (Sales or Profit) cell B1. The data is 
found in columns A and B of the Control Sheet worksheet.

Real-world Dashboard Case Studies
398
17.	 For the next data binding, Map data column selection, select Column as the 
Insertion Type. Bind Source Data to columns B and C.
18.	The final interactive component is the hidden State filter, which will select the 
appropriate data for the State and Product details. Insert a Combo Box selector into 
the canvas and make sure it is underneath all of the backgrounds. To make sure it is 
underneath, right-click on the Combo Box selector on the Object Browser and select 
Send To Back.
19.	Now we will bind the data from the Product Data worksheet. The labels will be bound 
to column B, since we are collecting all rows that belong to a state when clicking on 
a state from the map. Select Filtered Rows as Insertion Type and bind the Source 
Data to cells B2:R205. The Destination cells will be the peach area in the State and 
Drilldown Display worksheet.

Appendix A
399
20.	Go to the Behavior section of the hidden filter and bind Selected Item to the selected 
Map item on cell E1 from the Control Sheet worksheet.

Real-world Dashboard Case Studies
400
21.	 Now that the dashboard is complete, we want to improve the look a bit. As you can 
see, there are several layers of background objects that add depth to the dashboard 
components. Drag a variety of Background and Rectangle components onto the 
canvas and play around with the look until it becomes something that you desire.
Refer to the source code on the type of layering that we 
have accomplished with the Background and Rectangle 
components.
How it works...
In steps 1–3, you utilize what you learned in the Using maps to select data of an area or 
country recipe of Chapter 3, From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard, to set up your map 
display and data on the left-hand side of the dashboard. From your map selection, you 
then drive the right-hand side of the dashboard.
Steps 4–5 used the Displaying alerts on a map recipe from Chapter 5, Using Alerts, to display 
the different colored states on the map representing the amount of sales/profit each 
state produced.
In steps 6-8, you use what you learned in the recipes Adding a line chart to your dashboard 
from Chapter 2, Data Visualization, and Drilling down from a chart from Chapter 3, From a 
Static to an Interactive Dashboard, to create a YTD Sales/Profit chart that allows a user to 
drill down from the data values to a particular product.
In steps 9-12, you will use the Using alerts in a Scorecard recipe from Chapter 5, Using Alerts, 
to show a product's details and threshold for a selected state.
In steps 13-14, we simply built a Line Chart that takes the trend data from a selected product 
and state.
In steps 15-17, we used a Combo Selector component to select from two sets of data. 
The first set of data consists of the label Sales/Profit, which is important because other 
components in the dashboard drive off the destination of the Sales/Profit label. The second 
set of data contains the sales/profit data for the map object.
In steps 18-20, you utilize what you learned in the Using Filtered Rows recipe from Chapter 
3, From a Static to an Interactive Dashboard, to select the appropriate data from the Product 
Data worksheet. As you can see in the Product Data worksheet, you need to somehow 
group the states together into a selection. To accomplish this, a Filtered Rows selection 
is necessary.
The final steps consisted of adding backgrounds and providing a uniform aligned look and 
feel, recipes of which can be found in Chapter 1, Staying in Control.

The Future of 
Dashboarding with SAP 
Design Studio
When the first edition of this book was published back in 2011, SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards served as the only and premier dashboarding solution within the SAP 
BusinessObjects BI portfolio. A lot has changed since then. In 2012, SAP released the first 
version of SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio. This new tool has been built from scratch 
and lets you create interactive applications and dashboards that are fully HTML5-compatible 
and support direct connectivity to SAP HANA, SAP NetWeaver BW, and SAP BusinessObjects 
Universe (UNX) sources.
In this appendix, we will discuss the following topics:
f
f
What is SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio?
f
f
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards versus SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio
f
f
What is the SAP roadmap for dashboarding?

The Future of Dashboarding with SAP Design Studio
408
What is SAP BusinessObjects Design 
Studio?
Design Studio is a fresh new tool within the SAP BusinessObjects BI portfolio to create 
dashboards and interactive applications.
Design Studio tackles two of the biggest problem areas of SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards:
f
f
Connectivity to SAP source systems
f
f
Compatibility with mobile devices without any dependency on Adobe Flash
Design Studio fully supports SAP HANA, SAP NetWeaver BW, and SAP BusinessObjects 
Universe (UNX) sources. Since the tool is HTML5-compatible, we can run the applications we 
make on any device, whether it is a personal computer with a browser or a mobile device such 
as an iPad or iPhone.
App created with SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio

Appendix C
409
Just as in SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards, the Design Studio development environment 
lets you drag and drop components you want to use in a dashboard into a canvas and 
position them exactly as you want. A wide set of such components is available within Design 
Studio. Analytical components such as tables and charts can be used to visualize and 
display the data. Also, several filter, button, text, image and drop-down box components are 
present to facilitate interactive options. To facilitate the grouping of components, a set of 
container components is available. In addition, developers can create their own Design Studio 
components using the Design Studio SDK.
SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio Integrated Development Environment

The Future of Dashboarding with SAP Design Studio
410
To create interactivity between components, Design Studio uses scripting with JavaScript. For 
example, if a user selects a filter value from a drop-down box component, the datasource has 
to execute that filter and refresh the chart or table that displays the result. To make this work, 
a script has to be added to the drop-down box component so it will be executed each time the 
component is used. A wizard is included to support the developer in writing these scripts.
Scripting in SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio
Design Studio offers the option to fully take control of the look and feel of a dashboard or an 
application by using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). In CSS, the specific look of a component 
can be defined, such as its background color and its font size. Such a piece of CSS code can 
be used throughout the application for multiple components, while the CSS definition remains 
in a single location. These CSS files can be stored on a central server location and even be 
reused by multiple applications.
Design Studio applications can be deployed in three types of SAP environments: SAP 
BusinessObjects BI Platform, SAP NetWeaver BW, and SAP HANA.

Appendix C
411
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards versus 
SAP BusinessObjects Design Studio
SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards is an extremely flexible tool. It supports a wide range of 
different data sources and offers the integrated spreadsheet to tie everything together. Also, 
there is a very wide range of components (standard and third-party) available, which have 
detailed property settings to make specific adjustments.
Design Studio, on the other hand, has a more robust setup. The spreadsheet layer is gone and 
only datasources via SAP systems are supported. Also, web standards such as JavaScript and 
CSS are incorporated. The export functionality to create standalone SWF files is also gone and 
the deployment of Design Studio apps is only available through SAP environments.
The following table lists some key differences and similarities between SAP BusinessObjects 
Dashboards and Design Studio:

What is the SAP roadmap for dashboarding?
When we take a look at the SAP product roadmap for SAP BusinessObjects Dashboards, 
we see that there are almost no more planned innovations and future directions named. 
On the other hand, the product roadmap for Design Studio is packed with new features. 
Also, Design Studio has quite a steady release schedule with a new version every six months.
You can find the most recent versions of the SAP product roadmaps at 
http://service.sap.com/roadmap.

Appendix C
413
This is in line with the statement of direction for dashboarding that was published by SAP in 
2012. Eventually, the goal is to integrate SAP BusinessObjects and Design Studio into a single 
dashboarding tool.
To read the statement of direction, visit http://blogs.sap.com/
analytics/2012/04/17/the-future-of-dashboards-
strategy-and-direction/.
Although there are no concrete timelines set as yet, we can expect SAP to support SAP 
BusinessObjects Dashboards for a very long time as it has done so in the past. But it 
definitely would be a good idea to start looking at Design Studio and to stay up to date 
with the ongoing developments.
