political 
upheavals 
during 
the 1840s, with special reference 
to the "Schleswig 
Question." Rerup's points of departure 
are Grundtvig's 
fascination 
with 
Nordic mythology 
and Ingemann's 
romanticism 
of medieval 
history 
in his 
novels in the 1820s and 1830s. The connection 
between an elitist 
literary 
milieu in Copenhagen 
to a much broader 
Danish public world was provided 
by the Schleswig 
language dispute, 
with P. Hiort Lorenzen as the principal 
linkage. 
A similar 
process took place in the 1830s under the leadership 
of 
Orla Lehmann. Lehmann linked advocates of political 
liberalism 
with the 
National Liberals, 
eventually 
resulting 
in both the introduction 
of democ- 
racy and the outbreak 
of the Schleswig 
War in 1848. 
In these two volumes, 
readers 
will discover 
largely 
self-contained 
essays, 
with some overlapping 
and occasionally 
repetitive 
information. 
While I 
would have welcomed 
a stronger 
editorial 
hand, common terminology, 
and 
clearer 
justification 
for why an historical 
approach 
was used, Feldbsek 
chose 
differently. 
A positive 
outcome of this choice is that each author's 
individual 
approach and style remain intact, 
yielding 
both challenging 
and exciting 
reading. 
Nonetheless, 
the volumes 
would have been strengthened 
by discus- 
sion of the Middle Ages, (especially 
Saxo), clearer 
discrimination 
between 
"Danish" and "Nordic," 
and detailed 
discussion 
of Norway, 
Scania, Halland, 
and Blekinge. 
Moreover, 
the contributors 
emphasize Dano-German 
rela- 
tions to the degree that they ignore the impact on national 
identity 
caused 
by the British 
attacks 
on Copenhagen in 1801 and 1807, as well as the 
subsequent 
war between 
Denmark and England in 1807-1814. However, 
these reservations 
are minor, considering 
the wealth of material 
and the 
scope of a decidedly 
amorphous 
project. 
I applaud both the editor's 
courage 
in embarking 
at all and the expertise 
and stylistic 
excellence 
of the individual 
contributors. 
This loose collaboration 
between 
historians 
and literary 
critics 
has yielded 
new approaches, 
perspectives, 
and insights 
- evidence 
of Danish 
scholarship 
at its best. Not only scholars 
and students 
of Danish literature 
and history, 
but everyone 
interested 
in broader cultural 
developments 
in 
Scandinavia 
and Europe should find these volumes 
engaging. 
I eagerly 
await 
the remaining 
two volumes.

metaphors, 
and meaning. 
Some of us have even seen the opera carved from 
its pages. It is a post-War 
icon and, like many icons, not much revered 
these 
days, however 
secure its place in Swedish literary 
history. 
It is easy to forget 
how this "review 
of man in time and space" was also once a powerful 
cry in 
the atomic wilderness 
and was, like an earlier 
crying, 
equally unheeded. 
But when the peculiar charm of its invented 
vocabulary 
has faded and 
become the stuff 
of literary 
history, 
when its apocalyptic 
imagery 
has paled 
in the face of everyday 
atrocity, 
and when its Buck Rogers characters 
have 
collapsed 
into their 
postures, 
there 
yet remains 
the force of its language, 
the 
virtuosity 
of its invention, 
and the urgency 
of its message. The parts that 
once jarred 
us have rusted 
away by now and left revealed 
the essential 
clarity 
of the structure. 
This has also left us considerable 
beauty and pleasure, 
neither 
of which, however, 
seems to be in fashion 
these days. 
I assert 
all this because I have myself 
been given a ride on Anidra. Because 
I find so much of the poem moving 
even today, I have been puzzled that it 
has taken until now to be put into English. While it is true that ours is a 
highly 
prosaic age and one not favorable 
to literacy 
generally, 
I suspect 
that, 
for many, the very notion of epic poetry 
seems out of the temper of the 
times, 
even antithetical 
to its spirit. 
In the face of this, that Sweden should 
produce two such poets within the last forty 
years, Martinson 
and Goran 
Palm, is perhaps, 
little short of embarrassing. 
Let me declare my interest 
at once: I have myself 
made a translation 
of 
Erik Lindegren's 
libretto 
for the opera based on this poem. By this I mean 
only that I, too, have tried to wrest English words out of this text. It is not 
an easy job. There is no Nobel Prize for translators 
(however much that 
august committee 
has relied 
on their 
work for its decisions) 
. They are sitting 
ducks, inviting 
critics to take pot shots at them, and they rarely 
escape 
unscathed. 
If I have reservations, 
then, 
about this translation, 
they 
are within 
the context 
of knowing 
how difficult 
the translation 
of this poem is. 
It is good to be able to state that there 
is nothing 
incorrect 
in this version. 
This is not to be taken as faint 
praise in any sense, for the poem is laden with 
pitfalls. 
To take a simple example: the neologisms 
that litter 
the text, often 
a source of annoyance, 
are discretely 
handled in this translation 
and are, in 
some ways, better 
integrated 
into the text than they often seem in Swedish. 
On the other hand, there is the immediate 
problem of Doris. With all 
affection 
toward the bearers of that name, it rings quite differently 
in 
Swedish and English ears. For us, it is a very popular, even prosaic, name, 
often associated 
with the 1940s and 50s, perhaps having something 
to do 
with the fame of Doris Day. Via a note, however, 
Klass and Sjöberg are 
quick to connect it with a part of ancient Greece. This is a good try, but 
Doris, especially 
in the Engüsh compound, 
"Dorisland,55

fifties 
alternative 
to a well-known 
theme park. In this instance, 
Elspeth 
Harley Schubert's 
solution, 
Douris, which both attempts 
to avoid the obvi- 
ous English associations 
and retain a bit of the Swedish pronunciation, 
strikes 
me as better, 
though not by much. Who knows, after all, how 
exotically 
this name rang in Harry Martinson's 
ears? Klass and Sjöberg have 
also worked hard to keep, as much as possible, 
to the original 
rhythms 
and 
rhyme 
schemes. 
I think 
this decision is correct, 
though its application 
is not 
flawless 
and is, occasionally, 
irritating. 
(It is fair to point out, however, 
that 
Martinson 
himself 
sometimes 
broke his own established 
rhythms.) 
Given 
these small problems, 
I think 
their 
translation 
improves 
as it goes on, as if the 
text has finally 
settled 
in upon them. Furthermore, 
the translators 
provide a 
short list elucidating 
some of the knottiest 
terms. 
It seems to me that the hardest 
thing about translating 
an epic poem is 
to maintain 
the original 
intensity 
and it is on this rhetorical 
level that this 
version 
is weakest. 
The victories 
are lost in unguarded 
moments, 
when an 
unfortunate 
word-choice 
or a dead rhythm 
sabotages 
the solution. 
In one of 
the most remarkable 
sânpfer 
in the first 
section 
of the poem, number 
13, "Pa 
sjtiïte 
âret Aniara droß? after the Chief Astronomer's 
lecture about the 
bubble in the glass, the narrator 
flees to the sexual solace of Daisi Doody 
(another 
problem for American 
readers 
who remember 
Howdy) with the 
words, "Jag úggar hennés räddninpfsfamn 
om mote, ¡jag ber om inpfânpf 
i ett 
hängt sköte" Klass and Sjöberg render 
these lines, reasonably, 
as, "I beg a 
tryst 
within her saving arms, / I seek admission 
to a hairy lap," but, aside 
from 
the avoidance 
of a rhyme, 
"lap" simply 
does not ring, especially 
in the 
context 
of "tryst." 
I understand 
these problems. 
Indeed, having worked with parts of this 
poem, I am especially 
sympathetic 
to the difficulties 
Klass and Sjöberg faced. 
In one sense, however, 
I am too close to the language to ask the most 
important 
question: does it work in its own terms? 
To help me get outside 
my own experience, 
I asked a friend, 
a mechanical 
engineer 
involved 
with the 
technical 
aspects of computers, 
who knows no Scandinavian 
languages 
but 
is interested 
in the music and literature 
of the North, to make some notes on 
his encounter 
with this translation. 
I am pleased to report 
that he found no 
particular 
problems and quite enjoyed getting to know this remarkable 
poem. He found it a good read. I take that as a reasonable 
judgment 
of any 
translation. 
There is, however, 
one great hindrance 
to getting 
this translation 
into the 
English reader's 
hands: it is almost completely 
unobtainable. 
Though the 
translation 
won the American 
Scandinavian 
Foundation 
translation 
prize in 
1986, its edition of 2000 is not available in any English-speaking 
country, 
being, as Ingvar 
Holm's forward

out to Harry Martinson Society members," most of whom, I would have 
thought, would readily know the original. "Over and above this," continues 
Holm, "it is to be available to foreign visitors to Sweden, particularly 
to 
Olofström, with its Harry Martinson Study Center and the new Hotel 
Aniara." Attractive 
as Olofström and its new hotel are, this is hardly the way 
to help this poem reach the rest of the world.

Biblioteksskole og C.A. Reitzel, 1992. Pp. 176. DKK 185. 
Simon's revised and enlarged edition oí Gotisk 
Skrifi includes new transcrip- 
tion exercises having to do with Roman numeral weights and measures (nos. 
39-46) and additional census and military levying roll exercises (nos. 49- 
60). The preliminary 
essay on the history and usage of the Gothic Script 
(especially the Germanic origins and background) is informative, 
and there 
are introductory 
charts showing alphabets in upper- and lowercase, and a list 
of common abbreviations. Thereafter, seventy-three 
documents (or seg- 
ments of same) are reproduced in slightly 
reduced format, and all but three 
transcribed, 
but phonetic spellings are preserved throughout. 
As with the 1977 edition, the preponderance of documents and tran- 
scriptions have to do with Yding Parish in Skanderborg County, including 
copyholds, mortgages, deeds, forestry 
accounts, tithing conversions, testa- 
ments, and tax records. Additional documents not specifically 
tied to Yding 
include county/distria 
accounts, petitions for government 
employment, 
cen- 
sus enumerations, military levying rolls, church books, probate records, 
copyholds, and pensions. The volume is profusely 
illustrated 
with old engrav- 
ings and ornate calligraphic 
"doodlings," and includes a five-page 
bibliography. 
Simon introduces several of the sections with reproductions 
of published 
royal decrees, as for example the one on censuses (119-20) and also includes 
a helpful detailed schematic chart (148-9) showing probate jurisdictions in 
the historical Kingdom of Denmark proper. In addition, he provides helpful 
running commentaries on the history and peculiarities of specific record 
types, occasionally sticking his neck out - as with the unsubstantiated 
claim 
(120) that the plethora of widows and widowers on the censuses harks back 
to instructions of 1 February 1845 to enumerators to list divorced or 
separated individuals as "widows or widowers." (This rule was seldom, if 
ever, followed.) 
Problems with the book include a few peculiarities, such as Simon's 
transcription 
of the place "Tienemk" (doc. 62, line 28) as "Tieneirak"
