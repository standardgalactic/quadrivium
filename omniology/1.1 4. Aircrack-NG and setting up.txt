Aircrack-NG and setting up
(Setting up – Linux OS)

• You need a wireless adapter which support 
monitor/promiscuous mode
• Many available on Amazon / Ebay
• Many only support 2.4 GHz – keep in mind 
to get a dual band adapter for 5 GHz as well
• My preference are Alfa cards for example
AWUS1900
Aircrack-NG and setting up
(Setting up – Wireless Adapter)

• Kali recognizes most external wireless 
adapters natively 
• If the adapter is not showing up you need to 
install the drivers
• Example:
