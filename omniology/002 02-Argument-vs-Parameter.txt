def my_func(a, b):
# code here
In this context, a and b are called parameters of my_func
Also note that a and b are variables, local to my_func
When we call the function:
x = 10
y = 'a'
my_func(x, y)
x and y are called the arguments of my_func
Also note that x and y are passed by reference
i.e. the memory addresses of x and y are passed
It's OK if you mix up these terms â€“ everyone will understand what you mean!

x = 10
y = 'a'
my_func(x, y)
def my_func(a, b):
# code here
