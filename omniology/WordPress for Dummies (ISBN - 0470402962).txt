About the Author
Lisa Sabin-Wilson has worked with the WordPress software since its incep-
tion in 2003 and has built her business around providing technical support, 
hosting, and design solutions for bloggers who use WordPress. She reaches 
thousands of people worldwide with her WordPress services, skills, and 
knowledge regarding the product.
Lisa operates a few blogs online, all of which are powered by WordPress. Her 
personal blog (justagirlintheworld.com) has been online since February of 
2002; her design business at E.Webscapes (ewebscapes.com) has been online 
since 1999. She also provides a successful Web hosting service, Blogs About 
Hosting (blogs-about.com), which caters to blogs and bloggers on a global 
scale.
When she can be persuaded away from her computer, where she is usually 
hard at work providing design solutions for her WordPress clients, she some-
times emerges for public speaking appearances on the topics of design, blog-
ging, and WordPress. She has appeared at national conferences such as the 
annual South By Southwest Interactive Conference, and meet ups local to her 
Southeastern Wisconsin area like Web414.
Lisa consults with bloggers both large and small. Bloggers come in thousands 
of different fl avors, from business to personal, from creative to technical, and 
all points in between. Lisa is connected to thousands of them worldwide and 
appreciates the opportunity to share her knowledge through WordPress For 
Dummies. She hopes you fi nd great value in it, as well!
When she’s not designing or consulting with her clients, you can usually fi nd 
her either at her favorite coffee shop sipping espresso, on a mountaintop 
somewhere hitting the slopes with her husband and kids, or 100 feet beneath 
the ocean waters, scuba diving with her husband and swimming with the 
fi shes.


Dedication
My husband, Chris Wilson, is the single biggest source of encouragement 
and motivation I have in my life. In writing the fi rst edition and this second 
edition of WordPress For Dummies, he had my back every step of the way. 
Always helping, always encouraging, always listening and sharing. He told me 
he’s proud of me. I’m proud of you too, baby — for being the best husband in 
the world. I love you!
Author Acknowledgments
Many, many thanks and kudos to Matt Mullenweg, the core develop-
ment team from Automattic, and every single person involved in making 
WordPress the best blogging platform available on the Internet today. To the 
volunteers and testers who destroy all those pesky prerelease bugs for every 
new version release, the WordPress community thanks you! And to each and 
every WordPress plugin developer and theme designer who donates his or 
her time, skills, and knowledge to provide the entire WordPress community 
of users with invaluable tools that help us create dynamic blogs, thank you 
a thousand times! Every person mentioned here is an invaluable asset to 
the overall WordPress experience; I wish I could name you all, individually, 
except that there are literally thousands of you out there!
Huge thanks to Melody Layne, Steve Hayes, Amy Fandrei, and Rebecca 
Senninger from Wiley Publishing for their support, assistance, and guidance 
during the course of this project. Just the mere fact they had to read every 
page of this book means that they deserve the Medal of Honor! Also, many 
thanks to technical editor Paul Chaney and other editors of the project who 
also worked hard to make sure that I look somewhat literate here.
To any family members and friends whom I have neglected during the pro-
cess of writing this book, thank you for not abandoning me!
Finally, I thank my family — my husband, Chris; my children, Ben and 
Melissa; and my parents, Donald and Penny Sabin — for their unending sup-
port for this book, and in life.

Foreword
T
here used to be a program from Microsoft called FrontPage that was the 
first visual interface for creating Web sites that I saw. It worked like Word 
or Publisher, so with very little knowledge, I was able to hack together the 
world’s worst Web site in just a few hours without worrying about what was 
going on under the hood.
Years later when I look back at that Web site, I cringe, but at the time it was 
incredibly empowering. The software, though crude, helped me publish 
something anybody in the entire world could see. It opened up a world I had 
never imagined before.
Now, using software like WordPress, you can have a blog or Web site light-years 
beyond my first one in both functionality and aesthetics. However, just as my 
first Web experience whetted my appetite for more, I hope that your experi-
ence entices you to explore the thousands of free plugins, themes, and customi-
zations possible with WordPress, many of which are explained in this book.
WordPress is more than just software; it is a community, a rapidly evolving 
ecosystem, and a set of philosophies and opinions about how to create the 
best Web experience. When you embrace it, you’ll be in good company. 
WordPress users include old media organizations such as CNN, The New York 
Times, and The Wall Street Journal, along with millions of personal bloggers 
like myself for whom a WordPress blog is a means of expression.
Matt Mullenweg
Cofounder of WordPress 

Introduction
L
et’s see . . . it was 2003 when I discovered the wonders of WordPress. 
Way back then (and in Internet years, that’s actually a lot of time), I was 
using Movable Type as my blogging platform. My friend Chelle introduced me 
to the WordPress software. “Try it,” she said. “You’ll really like it.”
As somewhat a creature of habit, I felt reluctant to make the change. The 
growing buzz around the WordPress software made me curious, however. 
Shortly thereafter, Six Apart, the maker of Movable Type, made a drastic 
change in the licensing requirements. All of a sudden, software that used to 
be free cost money. As soon as Six Apart made that move, a mass exodus 
from Movable Type to WordPress seemed to occur. All the cool kids were 
doing it, so I decided to give it a shot.
I haven’t looked back. I’ve been with WordPress ever since.
The next year, 2004, blogging was being touted as the latest Internet trend. 
Representatives of the mainstream media looked on — openmouthed — 
as bloggers attained press credentials to major events; bloggers got book 
deals and press attention; bloggers earned five-figure monthly incomes from 
in-blog advertising; blogs were recognized and read by the general public; 
and blogs became accessories as ubiquitous for the young as the latest cell 
phone.
In 2005, businesses caught on to the phenomenon and began to embrace 
it. Major public-relations companies launched campaigns that included, or 
focused on, blogs. Chief executive officers and Fortune 500 companies joined 
the fray.
In 2006, blogs went from trend to mainstay. No longer novelties, blogs 
became natural extensions of daily communication, frequently replacing 
e-mail newsletters.
Blogs are here to stay. Authors, students, parents, business owners, academics, 
hobbyists — you name it — use blogs as a matter of course.
Technorati.com has been tracking the growth of the number of blogs for 
four years. As of April 2007, Technorati was tracking over 70 million blogs 
and seeing a growth of approximately 120,000 creates each day. Technorati’s 
David Sifry estimates that approximately 1.4 blogs are created every second 
of every day (see www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000493.html).

WordPress For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
WordPress has been a huge part of the blogging boom. Today, it’s the most 
popular blogging platform for personal, business, and corporate bloggers 
alike.
To a brand-new user, some aspects of WordPress can seem a little bit intimi-
dating. After you take a look under the hood, however, you begin to realize 
how intuitive, friendly, and extensible the software is.
This book presents an in-depth look at two popular versions of WordPress:
 
✓ The hosted version available at WordPress.com
 
✓ The self-hosted version available at WordPress.org
The book also covers managing and maintaining your WordPress blog 
through the use of WordPress plugins and themes.
If you’re interested in taking a detailed look at the blogging and Web site ser-
vices provided by WordPress, you happen to have just the right book in your 
hands.
About This Book
This book covers all the important aspects of WordPress that new users need 
to know to begin using the software for their own blog (or blogs). I cover 
the two most popular versions of WordPress, highlighting all the important 
topics, such as these:
 
✓ Setting up and using a hosted blog at WordPress.com
 
✓ Locating good hosting services for the self-hosted version of the soft-
ware (available at WordPress.org)
 
✓ Installing and setting up the WordPress.org software
 
✓ Navigating the Administration panels of both the hosted and self-hosted 
versions of WordPress
 
✓ Adding media files to your blog
 
✓ Finding and installing free themes to use in your WordPress blog
 
✓ Using basic coding to design your own WordPress theme or modify the 
one you’re using

 Introduction
 
✓ Using templates and tags in WordPress
 
✓ Installing, activating, and managing WordPress plugins
 
✓ Discovering the potential pitfalls associated with each version
 
✓ Understanding the challenges you face when running a WordPress–
powered site, such as dodging comment and trackback spam
 
✓ Exploring RSS feed syndication
 
✓ Migrating your existing blog to WordPress (if you are using a different 
blogging platform, such as Blogspot, Movable Type, or TypePad)
 
✓ Discovering the power of WordPress as a Content Management System 
(CMS) to create a full Web site, not just a blog
 
✓ Finding support, tips, and resources for using the WordPress software
With WordPress, you can truly tailor a blog to your own tastes and needs. All 
the tools are out there. Some of them are packaged with the WordPress soft-
ware; others are third-party plugins and add-ons created by members of the 
WordPress user community. It takes a little research, knowledge, and time on 
your part to put together a blog that suits your needs and gives your readers 
an exciting experience that keeps them coming back for more.
Conventions Used in This Book
Throughout the book, I apply the following typography conventions to guide 
you through some of the information I present:
 
✓ When I ask you to type something, the text that you’re supposed to type 
is in bold.
 
✓ When I suggest a keyword that you may want to enter in a search engine, 
that term appears in italics.
 
✓ Text that appears in this special font is certain to be a URL (Web 
address), e-mail address, filename, folder name, or code.
 
✓ When I use a term that I think you may not be familiar with, I apply 
italics to that term to let you know that I’m defining it.
 
✓ In some instances, I give you a basic idea of what a Web address or 
block of code looks like. When the text that you see may be different, 
depending on your settings and preferences, I apply italics to that text.

What You Are Not to Read
Don’t read supermarket tabloids. They’re certain to rot your brain.
This book covers the details of how to set up, use, and maintain the software 
for WordPress.com and WordPress.org. I don’t intend for you to read this 
book from cover to cover (unless you’re my mother — then I won’t forgive 
you if you don’t). Rather, hit the Table of Contents and the Index of this book 
to find the information you need.
If you never intend to run a hosted WordPress blog on your own Web server, 
you can skip Chapters 6, 7, and 8.
If you have no interest in setting up a hosted blog at WordPress.com, skip 
Chapters 3, 4, and 5.
If you aren’t interested in digging into the code of a WordPress template, and 
don’t want to find out how to apply CSS or HTML to enhance your design, 
you can skip Part V of this book, which contains Chapters 12, 13, 14, and 15.
Long story short: Take what you need, and leave the rest.
Foolish Assumptions
I’ll never know what assumptions you’ve made about me at this point, but I 
can tell you a few things that I already assume about you:
 
✓ You know what a computer is. You can turn it on, and you understand 
that if you spill coffee on your keyboard, you’ll have to run out and get a 
replacement.
 
✓ You understand how to hook yourself into the Internet and know the 
basics of using a Web browser to surf Web sites and blogs.
 
✓ You have a basic understanding of what blogs are, and you’re interested 
in using WordPress to start your own blog. Or you already have a blog, 
are already using WordPress, and want to understand the program 
better so that you can do more cool stuff and stop bugging your geeky 
best friend whenever you have a question about something. Or, even 
better, you already have a blog on another blogging platform and want 
to move your blog to WordPress.
 
✓ You know what e-mail is. You know what an e-mail address is. You actu-
ally have an e-mail address, and you send and receive e-mail on a semi-
regular basis.

 Introduction
If, when you approach your computer, you break out into a cold sweat, look-
ing similar to a deer caught in headlights, and say to yourself, “Here goes 
nothing!” before you even sit down in front of your monitor, you may want to 
brush up on your basic computer skills before you begin this book.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is made up of six parts that introduce you to the WordPress 
platform, including detailed information on two very popular versions of 
WordPress: the hosted version of WordPress.com and the self-hosted ver-
sion of WordPress.org. Also included is detailed information on WordPress 
themes and templates.
Part I: Introducing WordPress
The first part gives you an overview of WordPress and the advantages of 
making it your blogging platform. You might think of WordPress as coming 
in three “flavors”: vanilla (WordPress.com hosted solution), chocolate 
(WordPress.org self-hosted solution), and Neapolitan (WordPress MU, the 
multiuser solution). In this part, you also discover some of the fun aspects 
of blogging, such as RSS feed syndication and reader interaction through 
comments.
Part II: Using the WordPress 
Hosted Service
Part II takes you through signing up with the hosted service for a blog. You 
tour the Administration panel, explore writing and managing your blog, find 
out how to change the various themes available in this version, and discover 
how to enhance your blog and widgets.
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org
Part III explores the single-user version of the WordPress software available 
at WordPress.org. You install this software on your own hosted Web server, 
so I give you valuable information about domain registration, Web hosting 
providers, and a few of the basic tools (such as FTP) that you need to install 
to set up a WordPress blog. I also familiarize you with the Administration 
panel, where you personalize your blog and explore many of the settings that 
you need to manage and maintain your WordPress–powered blog.

WordPress For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Part IV: Flexing and Extending WordPress
This part shows you how to add images to your pages, including how to 
create a photo gallery on your site.
This part also reveals how to find, install, and use various WordPress plug-
ins to extend the functionality of your blog. It also steps into the world of 
WordPress themes, showing you where to find free themes, install them, and 
use them.
Part V: Customizing WordPress
Part V takes an in-depth look at the structure of a WordPress theme by taking 
you through each of the templates and explaining the template tags each 
step of the way. You find information on basic CSS and HTML that helps you 
tweak the free theme that you are using or even create your own theme.
This part also looks at the use of WordPress as a Content Management 
System (CMS) to power a full-blown Web site as well as a blog.
If the topics covered in this part of the book aren’t ones you’re interested 
in getting involved with yourself, the last chapter of this part talks about 
bringing in the professionals — the consultants who can help you achieve a 
custom-designed blog, as well as assist you with search engine optimization. 
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is in every For Dummies book that you will ever pick up. This 
part introduces ten Web sites that have really stretched the functionality of 
WordPress through plugins and themes. This part also shows you ten popular 
free WordPress themes that you can use to create a nice, clean look for your 
blog. Further, in this part you discover ten great WordPress plugins that you 
can use to provide your visitors (and yourself) some great functionality.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are those little pictures in the margins of the book that emphasize a 
point to remember, a danger to be aware of, or information that I think you 
may find helpful. Those points are illustrated as such:

7
 Introduction
 
Tips are little bits of information that you may find useful — procedures that 
aren’t necessarily obvious to the casual user or beginner.
 
When your mother warned you, “Don’t touch that pan — it’s hot!” but you 
touched it anyway, you discovered the meaning of “Ouch!” I use this icon for 
situations like that. Out of curiosity, you may very well touch the hot pan, but 
you can’t say that I didn’t warn you!
 
All geeky stuff goes here. Even though an aura of geekiness surrounds the 
use of the WordPress software, I surprised myself by not using this icon very 
much in this book. But I do use it in certain places, and when I do, it probably 
has to do with technical mumbo-jumbo that would have made your eyes glaze 
over had I elaborated. Luckily for you, these items are short and sweet, but I 
don’t promise that they won’t bore you to death. Good thing I use them spar-
ingly, hey?
 
When you see this icon, read the text next to it two or three times to brand it 
into your brain so that you remember whatever it was that I thought you 
needed to remember.
Where to Go from Here
As I mention in the “What You Are Not to Read” section of this introduction, 
take what you need, and leave the rest. This book is a veritable smorgasbord 
of WordPress information, ideas, concepts, tools, resources, and instruction. 
Some of it will apply directly to what you want to do with your WordPress 
blog. Other parts deal with topics that you’re only mildly curious about, so 
you may want to skim those pages.

WordPress

In this part . . .
R
eady to get started? I know I am! This part of the 
book provides a brief introduction to WordPress 
and blogging. WordPress is unique in offering three ver-
sions of its software, and I tell you about each version so 
that you can choose the one that’s right for you.

Chapter 1
What WordPress Can Do for You
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing how WordPress can benefit you
▶ Participating in the WordPress community
▶ Understanding the different versions of WordPress
I
n a world in which technology advances faster than a speeding locomo-
tive, WordPress is blogging made easy — and free! How else can you get 
your message out to a potential audience of millions worldwide and spend 
exactly nothing? There may be no such thing as a free lunch in this world, 
but you can bet your bottom dollar that there are free blogs to be had. 
WordPress serves them all up in one nifty package.
The software’s free price tag, its ease of use, and the speed at which you can 
get your blog up and running are great reasons to use WordPress to power 
your personal or business blog. An even greater reason is the incredibly sup-
portive and passionate WordPress community. In this chapter, I introduce 
you to the WordPress software so that you can begin to discover how effec-
tive it is as a tool for creating your blog or Web site.
Discovering the Benefits of WordPress
I work with first-time bloggers all the time — folks who are new to the idea of 
publishing on the Internet. One of the questions I’m most frequently asked is 
“How can I run a blog? I don’t even know how to code or create Web sites.”
Enter WordPress. You no longer need to worry about knowing the code, 
because the WordPress blogging software does the code part for you. When 
you log in to your blog, you have to do only two simple things to publish 
your thoughts and ideas:
 
1. Write your post.
 
2. Click a button to publish your post.
That’s it!

12
Part I: Introducing WordPress 
WordPress offers the following competitive advantages as the most popular 
blogging tool on the market:
 
✓ Diversity: Three versions of WordPress are available to suit nearly every 
type of blogger: a hosted turnkey solution, a version to install on the 
Web server of your choice, and a multiuser version that lets you offer 
blogs across a group or organization. I go into detail about each of these 
versions later in this chapter, in the “Choosing a WordPress Platform” 
section.
 
✓ Ease of use: WordPress setup is quick, and the software is easy to use.
 
✓ Extensibility: WordPress is extremely extensible, meaning that you can 
easily obtain plugins and tools that let you customize it to suit your 
purposes.
 
✓ Community of users: WordPress has a large and loyal members-helping-
members community via public support forums, mailing lists, and blogs 
geared to the use of WordPress.
The following sections fill in a few details about these features and point you 
to places in the book where you can find out more about them.
Easy to set up and use
WordPress is one of the only blog platforms that can brag about a five-minute 
installation — and stand behind it! Signing up for the hosted version of 
WordPress takes approximately the same amount of time.
 
Mind you, five minutes is an approximate installation time. It doesn’t include 
the time required to obtain domain registration and Web hosting services or 
to set up the options in the Administration panel.
When you complete the installation, however, the world of WordPress awaits 
you. The Administration panel is intuitive, well organized, and easy on the 
eyes. Everything is clear and logical, making it easy for even a first-time user 
to see where to go to manage settings and options.
The WordPress software surely has enough meat on it to keep the most 
experienced developer busy and happy. At the same time, however, it’s intui-
tive and friendly enough to make a novice user giddy about how easy getting 
started is. Each time you use WordPress, you can find out something exciting 
and new.

13
 Chapter 1: What WordPress Can Do for You
Extend WordPress’s capabilities
I’ve found that the most exciting and fun part of running a WordPress blog is 
exploring the flexibility of the software. Hundreds of plugins and themes are 
available to let you create a blog that functions the way you need it to.
If you think of your blog as a vacuum cleaner, plugins are the attachments. 
The attachments don’t function alone. When you add them to your vacuum 
cleaner, however, you add to the functionality of your vacuum, possibly 
improving its performance.
All WordPress blogs are pretty much the same at their core, so by using 
plugins, you can truly individualize your blog by providing additional fea-
tures and tools to benefit yourself and your readers. When you come upon 
a WordPress blog that has some really different and cool functions, 98 per-
cent of the time, you can include that function in your own blog by using 
a WordPress plugin. If you don’t know what plugin that blog is using, feel 
free to drop the blog owner an e-mail or leave a comment. WordPress blog 
owners usually are eager to share the great tools they discover.
Most plugins are available at no charge. You can find out more about 
WordPress plugins and where to get them in Chapter 10. Chapter 17 lists my 
choice of ten popular WordPress plugins available for download.
In addition to using plugins, you can embellish your WordPress blog with 
templates and themes. WordPress comes prepackaged with two themes 
to get you started. Figure 1-1 shows the famous Kubrick theme, created by 
Michael Heilemann from http://binarybonsai.com, which is displayed 
by default after you install and set up your blog.
The theme’s default form is blue and white, but a handy application built into 
the preferences lets you change the color of the top header.
 
This theme includes all the basic elements that you need when starting a new 
WordPress blog. You can extend your WordPress blog in a hundred ways with 
the use of plugins and themes that have been released by members of the 
WordPress community, but the Kubrick theme is a nice place to start.
Take part in the community
Allow me to introduce you to the fiercely loyal folks who make up the user 
base, better known as the vast WordPress community. This band of merry 
ladies and gentlemen comes from all around the globe, from California to 
Cairo, Florida to Florence, and all points in between and beyond.

In March 2005, Matt Mullenweg of WordPress proudly proclaimed that the 
number of WordPress downloads had reached 900,000 — an amazing land-
mark in the history of the software. But the real excitement occurred in 
August 2006, when WordPress logged more than 1 million downloads, and in 
2007, when the software had more than 3 million downloads. 
Don’t let the sheer volume of users fool you: WordPress has bragging rights 
to the most helpful blogging community on the Web today. You can find 
users helping other users in the support forums at http://wordpress.
org/support. You can also find users contributing to the very helpful 
WordPress Codex (a collection of how-to documents) at http://codex.
wordpress.org. Finally, across the blogosphere, you can find multiple 
blogs about WordPress itself, with users sharing their experiences and war 
stories in the hope of helping the next person who comes along.
You can subscribe to various mailing lists, too. These lists offer you the 
opportunity to become involved in various aspects of the WordPress commu-
nity, as well as in the future development of the software.

15
 Chapter 1: What WordPress Can Do for You
Don’t worry if you’re not a member of the WordPress community. Joining 
is easy: Simply start your own blog by using one of the three WordPress 
software options. If you’re already blogging on a different platform, such as 
Blogspot or Movable Type, WordPress makes it simple for you to migrate 
your current data from that platform to a new WordPress setup. (See the 
appendix for information about moving your existing blog to WordPress.)
Choosing a WordPress Platform
Among the realities of running a blog today is choosing among the veritable 
feast of software platforms to find the one that will perform the way you need 
it to. You want to be sure that the platform you choose has all the options 
The origins of WordPress
Once upon a time, there was a simple, PHP-
based blogging platform called b2. This soft-
ware, developed in 2001, slowly gained a bit of 
popularity among geek types as a way to publish 
content on the Internet. Its developer, Michel 
Valdrighi, kept development active until early 
2003, when users of the software noticed that 
Valdrighi seemed to have disappeared. They 
became a little concerned about b2’s future.
Somewhere deep in the heart of Texas, one 
young man in particular was very concerned, 
because b2 was his software of choice for pub-
lishing his own content on the World Wide Web. 
He didn’t want to see his favorite publishing tool 
go to waste or to face a tough decision about 
moving on to something new and unknown. 
You can view the original post to his own blog 
in which he wondered what to do (http://
ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-
software-dilemma).
In that post, he talked briefly about some of the 
other software that was available at the time, 
and he tossed around the idea of using the b2 
software to “to create a fork, integrating all the 
cool stuff that Michel would be working on right 
now if only he was around.”
Create a fork, he did. In the absence of b2’s 
developer, this young man developed from the 
original b2 code base a brand-new blogging 
application called WordPress.
That blog post was made on January 24, 
2003, and the young man’s name was (and is) 
Matt Mullenweg. On December 26, 2003, with 
the assistance of a few other developers, 
Mullenweg announced the arrival of the first 
official version of the WordPress software. The 
rest, as they say, is history. The history of this 
particular piece of software surely is one for the 
books, as it is the most popular blogging plat-
form available today.

16
Part I: Introducing WordPress 
you’re looking for. WordPress is unique in that it offers three versions of its 
software. Each version is designed to meet the various needs of bloggers. 
The three different versions of WordPress are the following:
 
✓ The hosted version at WordPress.com. (Part II of this book focuses on 
this version.)
 
✓ The self-installed and self-hosted version available at WordPress.org. 
(Part III focuses on this version.)
 
✓ The multiuser version, WordPress MU, available at http://
mu.wordpress.org. 
Certain features are available to you in every WordPress blog setup, whether 
you’re using the software from WordPress.org, the hosted version at 
WordPress.com, or the multiuser version of WordPress MU. These features 
include but aren’t limited to the following:
 
✓ Quick-and-easy installation and setup
 
✓ Full-featured blogging capability, letting you publish content to the Web 
through an easy-to-use Web-based interface
 
✓ Topical archiving of your posts, using categories
 
✓ Monthly archiving of your posts, with the ability to provide a listing of 
those archives for easy navigation through your site.
 
✓ Comment and trackback tools
 
✓ Automatic spam protection through Akismet
 
✓ Built-in gallery integration for photos and images
 
✓ Media Manager for video and audio files
 
✓ Great community support
 
✓ Unlimited number of static pages, letting you step out of the blog box 
and into the sphere of running a fully functional Web site
 
✓ RSS capability with RSS 2.0, RSS 1.0, and Atom support
 
✓ Tools for importing content from different blogging systems (such as 
Blogger, Movable Type, and LiveJournal)
Table 1-1 compares the three WordPress versions.

Part I: Introducing WordPress 
Choosing the hosted version 
from WordPress.com
WordPress.com is a free service. If downloading, installing, and using soft-
ware on a Web server sound like Greek to you — and are things you’d rather 
avoid — the WordPress folks provide a solution for you at WordPress.com.
WordPress.com is a hosted solution, which means it has no software 
requirement, no downloads, and no installation or server configurations. 
Everything’s done for you on the back end, behind the scenes. You don’t 
even have to worry about how the process happens; it happens quickly, and 
before you know it, you’re making your first blog post using a WordPress.
com blog solution.
WordPress.com has some limitations. You can’t install plugins or custom 
themes, for example, and you can’t customize the base code files. But even 
with its limitations, WordPress.com is an excellent starting point if you’re 
brand new to blogging and a little intimidated by the configuration require-
ments of the self-installed WordPress.org software.
The good news is this: If you outgrow your WordPress.com hosted blog in the 
future and want to make a move to the self-hosted WordPress.org software, 
you can. You can even take all the content from your WordPress.com-hosted 
blog with you and easily import it into your new setup with the WordPress.
org software.
So in the grand scheme of things, you’re really not that limited.
Self-hosting with WordPress.org
The self-installed version from WordPress.org (covered in Part III) requires 
you to download the software from the WordPress Web site and install it on a 
Web server. Unless you own your own Web server, you need to lease one — 
or lease space on one.
Using a Web server is typically referred to as Web hosting, and unless you 
know someone who knows someone, hosting generally isn’t free. That being 
said, Web hosting doesn’t cost a whole lot, either. You can usually obtain a 
good Web hosting service for anywhere from $5 to $10 per month. (Chapter 
6 gives you the important details you need to know about obtaining a Web 
host.) You need to make sure, however, that any Web host you choose to 
work with has the required software installed on the Web server. Currently, 
the minimum software requirements for WordPress include

19
 Chapter 1: What WordPress Can Do for You
 
✓ PHP version 4.3 or greater
 
✓ MySQL version 4.0 or greater
After you have WordPress installed on your Web server (see the installa-
tion instructions in Chapter 6), you can start using it to blog to your heart’s 
content. With the WordPress software, you can install several plugins that 
extend the functionality of the blogging system, as I describe in Chapter 10. 
You also have full control of the core files and code that WordPress is built 
on. So if you have a knack for PHP and knowledge of MySQL, you can work 
within the code to make changes that you think would be good for you and 
your blog.
You don’t need design ability to make your blog look great. Members of the 
WordPress community have created more than 1,600 WordPress themes 
(designs), and you can download them for free and install them on your 
WordPress blog (see Chapter 11). Additionally, if you’re creatively inclined, 
like to create designs on your own, and know Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), 
you have full access to the template system within WordPress and can create 
your own custom themes (see Chapters 12 and 13).
Running a network of blogs 
with WordPress MU
Although the WordPress.com hosted service runs on the WordPress MU 
software, and the end-user configuration settings are very similar, setting up, 
administering, and managing this version of WordPress differ a great deal 
from the same processes in the WordPress.com or WordPress.org versions.
WordPress MU lets you run thousands of blogs on one installation of its 
software platform, on one domain. Its biggest claim to fame, of course, is the 
hosted version of WordPress.com, which uses the MU platform to run more 
than 1 million blogs and climbing.
When you install and use WordPress MU, you become administrator of a net-
work of blogs. The administration interface for WordPress MU differs from 
WordPress.com and the software from WordPress.org, in that you’re config-
uring options and settings for your blog as well as for multiple blogs across 
your network.
WordPress MU does everything the original software from WordPress.org 
does, so you can provide bloggers all the functionality that WordPress users 
have come to expect and enjoy.

20
Part I: Introducing WordPress 
WordPress MU isn’t meant for the casual user or beginner. It’s also not meant 
for bloggers who want to run five to ten of their own blogs on one domain. 
Who is it meant for, then?
 
✓ Blog networks (such as Edublogs.org) that currently have more than 150 
blogs.
 
✓ Newspapers and magazines, such as The New York Times, and universi-
ties such as Harvard Law School that currently use WordPress MU to 
manage the blog sections of their Web sites.
 
✓ Niche-specific blog networks, such as Edublogs.org, that use WordPress 
MU to manage their full networks of free blogs for teachers, educators, 
lecturers, librarians, and other education professionals.
If you’re interested in that software, check out more details at the WordPress 
MU Web site at http://mu.wordpress.org.

Chapter 2
WordPress Blogging Basics
In This Chapter
▶ Considering blog types
▶ Finding out what blog technology can do for you
▶ Outlining your initial blog plan
A
 lot happens behind the scenes to make your WordPress blog or 
Web site function. The beauty of it is this: You don’t have to worry 
about what’s happening on the back end in order to manage and maintain a 
WordPress site — unless you really want to. In this chapter, I delve a little bit 
into the technology behind the WordPress platform, including a brief look at 
PHP and MySQL, two software components required to run WordPress.
This chapter also covers some of the various blogging technologies that help 
you on your way to running a successful blog, such as the use of comments 
and RSS feed technology, as well as information about combating spam.
This Crazy Little Thing Called Blog
Blogging is an evolutionary process, and I have a strong feeling that blogs 
have evolved beyond personal journals to become tools for real journalism, 
business, and authorship.
A blog is a fabulous tool to use to publish your personal diary of thoughts 
and ideas; however, blogs also serve as excellent tools for business, editorial 
journalism, news, and entertainment. Here are some ways that people use 
blogs:

22
Part I: Introducing WordPress 
 
✓ Personal: This type of blogger creates a blog as a personal journal or 
diary. You’re considered to be a personal blogger if you use your blog 
mainly to discuss topics that are personal to you or your life — your 
family, your cats, your children, or your interests (for example, technol-
ogy, politics, sports, art, or photography). My own blog, which you’ll 
find at http://justagirlintheworld.com, is an example of a per-
sonal blog.
 
✓ Business: This type of blogger uses the power of blogs to promote her 
company’s business services and/or products on the Internet. Blogs 
are very effective tools for promotion and marketing, and these blogs 
usually offer helpful information to readers and consumers, such as ad 
tips and product reviews. Business blogs also let readers provide feed-
back and ideas, which can help a company improve its services. Search 
engines (such as Google, Yahoo!, and MSN) really like Web sites that 
are updated on a regular basis, and using a blog for your business lets 
you update your Web site regularly with content and information that 
your readers and consumers may find helpful. At the same time, you can 
increase your company’s exposure in the search engines by giving the 
search engines a lot of content to sift through and include in the search 
results. A good example of this is a company called ServerBeach — 
it keeps a blog on the hosted WordPress.com service at http://
serverbeach.wordpress.com.
 
✓ Media/journalism: More and more popular news outlets such as Fox 
News, MSNBC, and CNN are adding blogs to their Web sites to provide 
information on current events, politics, and news on a regional, national, 
and international level. These news organizations often have editorial 
bloggers as well. Editorial cartoonist Daryl Cagle, for example, maintains 
a blog on MSNBC’s Web site at http://cagle.msnbc.com/news/
blog, where he discusses his cartoons and the feedback he receives 
from readers.
 
✓ Citizen journalism: At one time, I might have put these bloggers in the 
Personal category, but blogs have really opened opportunities for aver-
age citizens to have a great effect on the analysis and dissemination of 
news and information on a national and international level. The emer-
gence of citizen journalism coincided with the swing from old media to 
new media. In old media, the journalists and news organizations direct 
the conversation about news topics.
 
 With the popularity of blogs and the millions of bloggers who exploded 
onto the Internet, old media felt a change in the wind. Average citizens, 
using the power of their voices on blogs, changed the direction of the 
conversation, with many of these bloggers fact-checking news stories 
and exposing inconsistencies, with the intention of keeping the media 
or local politicians in check. Many of these bloggers are interviewed 
on major cable news programs as the mainstream media recognize the 

23
 Chapter 2: WordPress Blogging Basics
importance of the emergence of the citizen voice through blogging. 
An example of citizen journalism is the Power Line Blog at http://
powerlineblog.com. 
 
✓ Professional: This category of blogger is growing every day. Professional 
bloggers are paid to blog for individual companies or Web sites. Blog net-
works, such as WeblogsInc.com, hire bloggers to write on certain topics 
of interest. Also, several services match advertisers with bloggers, so that 
the advertisers pay bloggers to make blog posts about their products. Is it 
possible to make money as a blogger? Yes, and making money is becom-
ing common these days. If you’re interested in this type of blogging,

Darren is considered to be the grandfather of all professional bloggers. 
Dipping Into Blog Technologies
The WordPress software is a personal publishing system that uses a PHP-
and-MySQL platform, which provides you everything you need to create your 
own blog and publish your own content dynamically, without having to know 
how to program those pages yourself. In short, all your content is stored in a 
MySQL database in your hosting account.
 
PHP (which stands for PHP Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting 
language for creating dynamic Web pages. When a visitor opens a page built 
in PHP, the server processes the PHP commands and then sends the results 
to the visitor’s browser. MySQL is an open source relational database manage-
ment system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL), the most 
popular language for adding, accessing, and processing data in a database. If 
that all sounds Greek to you, just think of MySQL as a big filing cabinet where 
all the content on your blog is stored.
Every time a visitor goes to your blog to read your content, he makes a request 
that’s sent to your server. The PHP programming language receives that 
request, obtains the requested information from the MySQL database, and then 
presents the requested information to your visitor through his Web browser.
In using the term content as it applies to the data that’s stored in the MySQL 
database, I’m referring to your blog posts, comments, and options that you 
set up in the WordPress Administration panel. The theme (design) you 
choose to use for your blog — whether it’s the default theme, one you create 
for yourself, or one that you have custom-designed for you — isn’t part of 
the content in this case. Those files are part of the file system and aren’t 
stored in the database. So it’s a good idea to create and keep a backup of any 
theme files that you’re currently using. See Part IV for further information on 
WordPress theme management.

24
Part I: Introducing WordPress 
 
When you look for a hosting service, keep an eye out for the hosts that pro-
vide daily backups of your site, so that your content/data won’t be lost in case 
something happens. Web hosting providers that offer daily backups as part of 
their services can save the day by restoring your site to its original form.
Archiving your publishing history
Packaged within the WordPress software is the capability to maintain chron-
ological and categorized archives of your publishing history, automatically. 
WordPress uses PHP and MySQL technology to sort and organize everything 
you publish in an order that you, and your readers, can access by date and 
category. This archiving process is done automatically with every post you 
publish to your blog.
When you create a post on your WordPress blog, you can file that post under a 
category that you specify. This feature makes for a very nifty archiving system 
in which you and your readers can find articles/posts that you’ve placed within 
a specific category. The archives page on my personal blog (see it at http://
justagirlintheworld.com/archives) contains a Topical Archive Pages 
section, where you find a list of categories I’ve created for my blog posts. 
Clicking the Blog Design link below the Topical archive pages heading takes you 
to a listing of posts that I wrote on that topic (see Figure 2-1 and Figure 2-2).
WordPress lets you create as many categories as you want for filing your 
blog posts by topic. I’ve seen blogs that have just one category and blogs 
that have up to 1,800 categories — WordPress is all about personal prefer-
ence and how you want to organize your content. On the other hand, using 
WordPress categories is your choice. You don’t have to use the category fea-
ture if you’d rather not.
Interacting with your readers 
through comments
One of the most exciting and fun aspects of blogging with WordPress is get-
ting feedback from your readers the moment you make a post to your blog. 
Feedback, referred to as blog comments, is akin to having a guestbook on your 
blog. People can leave notes for you that are published to your site, and you 
can respond and engage your readers in conversation about the topic at hand 
(see Figure 2-3 and Figure 2-4). Having this function in your blog creates the 
opportunity to expand the thoughts and ideas that you presented in your blog 
post by giving your readers the opportunity to add their two cents’ worth.

In the WordPress Administration panel, you have full administrative control 
over who can and can’t leave comments. In addition, if someone leaves a 
comment with questionable content, you can edit the comment or delete it. 
You’re also free to choose not to allow any comments on your blog.

26
Part I: Introducing WordPress 
 
Figure 2-3: 
Readers use 
the form to

comments.
 
 
Some blog users say that a blog without comments isn’t a blog at all. This 
belief is common in the blogging community, because experiencing visitor 
feedback through the use of comments is part of what has made blogging so 
popular. It’s a personal choice. Publishing a blog without comments lets your 
readers partake of your published words passively. Allowing comments on 
your blog invites your audience members to actively involve themselves in 
your blog by creating a discussion and dialogue about your content. By and 
large, readers find commenting to be a satisfying experience when they visit 
blogs, because comments make them part of the discussion.
Feeding your readers
RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. An RSS feed is a standard feature 
that blog readers have come to expect. So what is it, really?
The Introduction to RSS page on the resource site WebReference.com (www.
webreference.com/authoring/languages/xml/rss/intro/) defines 
RSS as “a lightweight XML format designed for sharing headlines and other 
Web content. Think of it as a distributable ‘What’s New’ for your site.”

consumption. Table 2-1 lists some of the most popular feed readers on the 
market today.

This is a free service that requires you to

For your blog readers to stay updated with the latest and greatest content you 
post to your site, they need to subscribe to your RSS feed. Most blogging plat-
forms allow the RSS feeds to be autodiscovered by the various feed readers — 
meaning that the reader needs only to enter your site’s URL, and the program 
will automatically find your RSS feed.
 
 Most browser systems today alert visitors to the RSS feed on your site by dis-
playing the universally recognized orange RSS feed icon, shown in the margin.
WordPress has built-in RSS feeds in several formats. Because the feeds are 
built into the software platform, you don’t need to do anything to provide 
your readers an RSS feed of your content. Check out Chapter 8 to find out 
more about using RSS feeds within the WordPress program.
Tracking back
The best way to understand trackbacks is to think of them as comments, 
except for one thing: Trackbacks are comments that are left on your blog by 
other blogs, not by actual people. Sounds perfectly reasonable, doesn’t it?
Actually, it does.
A trackback happens when you make a post on your blog, and within that 
post, you provide a link to a post made by another blogger in a different blog. 
When you publish that post, your blog sends a sort of electronic memo to the 
blog you’ve linked to. That blog receives the memo and posts an acknowledg-
ment of receipt in a comment to the post that you linked to.

29
 Chapter 2: WordPress Blogging Basics
That memo is sent via a network ping (a tool used to test, or verify, whether 
a link is reachable across the Internet) from your site to the site you link 
to. This process works as long as both blogs support trackback protocol. 
WordPress does, and so do almost all the other major blogging platforms 
except Blogspot. (Blogspot users need to sign up for a third-party program 
called HaloScan to have trackback functionality in their blogs.)
Sending a trackback to a blog is a nice way of telling the blogger that you like 
the information she presented in her blog post. Every blogger appreciates 
the receipt of trackbacks to their posts from other bloggers.
Dealing with comment and 
trackback spam
Ugh. The absolute bane of every blogger’s existence is comment and track-
back spam. When blogs became the “It” things on the Internet, spammers 
saw an opportunity. If you’ve ever received spam in your e-mail program, the 
concept is similar and just as frustrating.
Before blogs came onto the scene, you often saw spammers filling Internet 
guestbooks with their links but not leaving any relevant comments. The 
reason is simple: Web sites receive higher rankings in the major search 
engines if they have multiple links coming in from other sites. Enter blog soft-
ware, with comment and trackback technologies — prime breeding ground 
for millions of spammers.
Because comments and trackbacks are published to your site publicly — and 
usually with a link to the commenters’ Web sites — spammers got their site 
links posted on millions of blogs by creating programs that automatically 
seek Web sites with commenting systems and then hammer those systems 
with tons of comments that contain links back to their own sites.
No blogger likes spam. As a matter of fact, blogging services such as 
WordPress have spent untold hours in the name of stopping these spammers 
in their tracks, and for the most part, they’ve been successful. Every once in 
a while, however, spammers sneak through. Many spammers are offensive, 
and all of them are frustrating because they don’t contribute to the ongoing 
conversations that occur in blogs.
All WordPress systems have one very major, very excellent thing in common: 
Akismet, which kills spam dead. Chapter 10 tells you more about Akismet, 
which is brought to you by Automattic, the maker of WordPress.com.

Part I: Introducing WordPress 
Moving On to the Business of Blogging
Before getting started with blogging, you need to take a long look at your big 
plans for your Web site. A word of advice: Organize your plan of attack before 
you start. Have a good idea of what types of information you want to publish, 
how you want to present and organize that information, and what types of 
services and interaction you want to provide your audience.
It doesn’t matter whether you’re planning to start a personal blog as a diary 
of your daily life or a business blog to provide useful information to readers 
who are interested in your area of expertise. All potential bloggers have ideas 
about what type of information they want to present, and you wouldn’t be 
considering starting a new blog if you didn’t want to share that information 
(no matter what it is) with the rest of the world via the Internet. So having a 
plan of attack is helpful when you’re starting out.
Ask this question out loud: “What am I going to blog about?” Go ahead — ask 
it. Do you have an answer? Maybe you do, and maybe not — either way, it’s 
all right. There’s no clear set of ground rules you must follow. Having an idea 
of what you’re planning to write about in your blog makes planning your 
attack a little easier. You may want to write about your personal life. Maybe 
you plan to share only some of your photography and provide very little 
commentary to go along with it. Or maybe you’re a business owner, and you 
want to blog about your services and current news within your industry.
Having an idea of your subject matter will help you determine how you want 
to deliver that information. My design blog, for example, is where I write 
about Web design projects, client case studies, and news related to design 
and blogging. You won’t find pictures of my cats there, but you will find those 
pictures on my personal blog. I keep the two blogs separate, much in the 
same way that most of us like to keep a distinct line of separation between 
our personal and professional lives, no matter what industry we work in.
With your topic in mind, ask yourself these questions:
 
✓ How often will I update my blog with new posts? Daily? Weekly?
 
✓ Do I want to encourage discussion by letting my readers comment on 
my blog posts?
 
✓ Do I want to make every post available for public display? Am I okay 
with my boss or my family finding and reading my blog posts?
 
✓ How will I categorize my posts?
 
✓ Do I want to publish the full content of my posts in my RSS feed, or just 
excerpts?
 
✓ Do I want my blog posts to be easy for search engines to find?
When you have your topic and plan of delivery in mind, you can move for-
ward and adjust your blog settings to work with your plan.

I
f installing software on a Web server sounds like something you’d rather 
avoid at all costs, WordPress.com has an alternative for you.
This part takes a complete look at the hosted service offered at WordPress.
com, and in this chapter, you discover how to obtain a free blog through this 
service. You also find out how to get your hosted blog up and running.
Don’t confuse WordPress.com with the blogging software available for down-
load at WordPress.org! The two were created and developed by the same 
folks, and they do have the same name; however, they are different varieties 
of WordPress. (See Part III for information on installing and using the self-
hosted version of WordPress.org.)
Creating a WordPress.com Account
To create your WordPress.com user account, follow these steps:
 
1. In your browser, enter the URL http://wordpress.com.
 
2. On the page that appears, click the big Sign Up Now! button (shown in 
Figure 3-1).
 
 You’re taken to the WordPress.com signup page at http://word
press.com/signup.

34
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
 
Figure 3-1: 
On the 
WordPress.
com main 
page, click 
the Sign 
Up Now! 
button.
 
 
3. In the Username text box, enter the name you want to use to log in to 
your blog from now until forever.
 
 This username must be at least four characters in length with letters and 
numbers only. This username cannot be changed for the blog you are 
creating right now. In the future, you can sign up for a new WordPress.
com account with a new username; you also start over with a new blog.
 
4. Enter a password of your choice first in the Password box and then in 
the Confirm box.
 
 You use this password to log in to your new WordPress.com account. 
Choose, and then type, a password that you will remember, but not one 
that would be easy for any outside users to guess. 
 
5. Enter your e-mail address in the Email Address box.
 
 This address is not made public on your blog; rather, it’s used for 
communication between you and WordPress.com. You can change 
this address later, in the Options section in your WordPress.com 
Administration panel.
 
6. Select the check box in the Legal Flotsam section.
 
 Selecting the Legal Flotsam box lets the WordPress.com folks know that 
you’ve read its terms of service.

35
 Chapter 3: Getting Started with WordPress.com
 
7. Select either Gimme a Blog! or Just a Username, Please.
 
 The Gimme a Blog! option signs you up with a WordPress.com account 
and sets you up with a new WordPress.com blog. The Just a Username, 
Please option just signs you up with a new WordPress.com account, 
without the blog-setup part. You may want only to reserve a username 
in WordPress.com for now, which is why you might choose the second 
option.
 
8. Click the Next button.
 
9. In the Blog Domain text box, enter what you choose as your blog 
domain name.
 
 Whatever you enter here becomes the URL address of your blog. It must 
be at least four characters (letters and numbers only), and you can’t 
change it later, so choose carefully! (The domain name of your blog 
does not have to be the same as your username, although WordPress.
com already fills in this text box for you, with your username. You can 
choose any domain name you want; WordPress.com lets you know 
whether that domain name is available within its network.)
 
10. In the Blog Title text box, enter the name you’ve chosen for your blog.
 
 Your blog title doesn’t have to be the same as your username, and you 
can change it later in the Options section in your Administration panel.
 
11. Choose your language preference from the Language drop-down menu.
 
 Choose the primary language that you will be blogging in.
 
12. Select the Privacy check box if you want your blog to be public. 
Deselect this box if you want your blog to be private and not show up 
in search engines. (By default, this box is checked for you.)
 
 Some bloggers actually do not want their blogs to be indexed by search 
engines, amazingly enough. Like them, you may want to run a private 
blog for which you decide who can, and cannot, view the contents of 
your blog.
 
13. Click the Sign-Up button, and you’re done!
 
 A new page opens with a message telling you that WordPress.com has 
sent you an e-mail containing a link to activate your account. 
 
14. Check your e-mail and click the link contained within it to activate 
your new WordPress.com blog. 
 
 A page loads with a message that your blog is now active. That page also 
displays your username and password. You receive another e-mail from 
WordPress.com that contains your username and password, as well as 
some useful links for navigating around WordPress.com — for example, 
the sign-in page, the Write Post page, and so on.

36
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
Your new blog is yours to use for the life of your blogging career at 
WordPress.com. You can log in to your blog any time by going to http://
wordpress.com and filling in the Already Hip? box (shown in Figure 3-2) on 
the main page with your WordPress.com username and password.
 
Figure 3-2: 
Already hip? 
Go ahead 
and log 
in to your 
new blog.
 
 
Have you ever signed up for a service on the Web, only to forget your user-
name and/or password for that service mere weeks after the fact? Yep, me, 
too. It is a very good idea to file that e-mail from WordPress.com in a safe place 
for future reference. Just make sure that you remember where you put it. Or 
you can tell WordPress.com to remember you each time you enter the site. To 
do so, select the Remember Me check box; WordPress.com places a cookie 
in your browser files that tells it to remember your login credentials the next 
time you visit the site. (You need to have cookies enabled in your browser 
configurations for this feature to work.)
If you delete your cookies in your browser and then visit WordPress.com 
again, you won’t see the WordPress.com menu bar and have to log in again. 
Likewise, after you delete the cookies in your browser, when you visit your 
new blog, it appears to you as though you are a visitor (that is, you see no 
menu bar with quick links for logging in to your Administration panel). In this 
case, you have to revisit the WordPress.com main site to log in again.
Navigating WordPress.com
When you’ve successfully logged in to your new account, WordPress returns 
you to the main WordPress.com Web site — only this time, you see some-
thing slightly different at the top. The page now displays the WordPress.com 
menu bar, shown in Figure 3-3. The WordPress.com menu bar contains some 
shortcut links to some important areas of your Administration panel.
 
The WordPress.com menu bar also appears at the top of any WordPress.com 
blog you surf to, as long as you are logged in to your WordPress.com account. 
The WordPress.com menu bar consists of several helpful quick links for you 
to access your account, your Administration panel, and various options. From 
left to right, these quick links include

37
 Chapter 3: Getting Started with WordPress.com
 
✓ My Account: Hover your mouse pointer over this link, and you see a 
drop-down menu that consists of the following:
 
• Global Dashboard: Takes you to the Dashboard panel.

Dashboard that displays information about your blog such as how 
many visitors you have on a daily basis, referrers, and keywords.
 
• Tag Surfer: Takes you to the Tag Surfer, where you can find out 
what people are talking about based on keywords.
 
• My Comments: Takes you to the My Comments section in the 
WordPress Administration panel, where you can view all comments 
you’ve left anywhere within the WordPress.com network of blogs.
 
• Edit Profile: Takes you to the Your Profile section in your 
Administration panel, where you can edit your own user profile.
 
• Support: Takes you to an area where you can get assistance from 
the folks who run WordPress.com (http://support.word
press.com).
 
• WordPress.com: Takes you to the main WordPress.com Web site.
 
• Logout: Lets you log out.
 
✓ My Dashboard: Click this link to go to the Dashboard page. I discuss the 
Dashboard page in detail in the next section.
 
✓ New Post: Click this link to go to the Write Post page, where you can 
write and publish a new post to your blog. If you want to get started 
right away with a new post, see Chapter 4.
 
✓ Blog Info: Hover your mouse pointer over this link to see a drop-down 
menu with the following elements:
 
• Random Post: Loads, in the same window, a random post from the 
blog you are visiting.
 
• Subscribe to Blog: Loads the Blog Surfer page within your 
Administration panel, allowing you to subscribe to the blog you’re 
visiting.
 
• Add to Blogroll: Automatically adds the blog you are visiting to 
your blogroll.
 
• Report as Spam: Reports the blog to WordPress.com administra-
tion as a spam blog.
 
• Report as Mature: Reports the blog to WordPress.com administra-
tion as a blog containing mature content.

Using the WordPress.com Dashboard
When you click the My Dashboard link in the WordPress.com menu bar 
(covered in the preceding section), you go directly to your WordPress.com 
Administration panel, starting at the Dashboard page (see Figure 3-4). Several 
modules within your Dashboard provide you with information about your blog, 
as well as actions you can take to navigate to other areas of the Administration 
panel, such as writing a new post, and adding a new link or blogroll.
The Dashboard modules are configurable; you can move them around on 
your Dashboard page and change the way the modules display. Hover your 
mouse over the title bar of the module you want to move, click once and drag 
it to the spot you’d like to display it, and then release your mouse button to 
drop it. This drag n’ drop capability is available not only on the Dashboard 
page, but also on all the inner pages of the WordPress Administration panel 
so you can really configure it to suit your needs. You can also expand (open) 
and collapse (close) the individual modules by clicking your mouse any-
where within the grey title bar of the module. This is a really nice feature 

39
 Chapter 3: Getting Started with WordPress.com
because it allows you to utilize the Dashboard for just those modules that 
you use regularly. The concept is easy: Keep the modules you use all the 
time open and close the ones that you only use occasionally — you can open 
those modules only when you really need them.
 
The navigation menu in the WordPress Dashboard appears on the left side 
of your browser window. When you need to get back to the WordPress 
Dashboard, click the Dashboard link that appears at the top of the naviga-
tion menu of any of the pages within your WordPress Administration panel. 
Each navigation item that appears in the menu has an arrow to the right of 
the header — clicking that arrow expands (open) the menu for that item. 
Likewise, clicking the arrow again collapses (close) the submenu.
Right Now
The Right Now module of the Dashboard gives you some stats on what is 
happening in your blog this very second. Figure 3-4 shows what was happen-
ing in my WordPress.com blog when I took a picture of it.
 
Figure 3-4:

Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
The Dashboard displays the following information under the At a Glance 
header:
 
✓ The number of posts: The number here always reflects the total number 
of posts you currently have in your WordPress blog. Figure 3-4 shows 
I currently have 10 posts on my blog. The number is blue; click the 
number and you go to the Edit Posts page, where you can edit the posts 
on your blog. I cover editing posts in Chapter 4.
 
✓ The number of pages: This is the current number of pages on your blog, 
which will change as you add or delete pages. (Pages, in this context, 
refer to the static pages you have created in your blog.) Figure 3-4 shows 
that my blog has 1 page.
 
 Clicking this link takes you to the Edit Pages page, where you can 
view, edit, and delete your current pages. (Find the difference between 
WordPress posts and pages in Chapter 4.)
 
✓ The number of categories: This is the current number of categories you 
have on your blog, which will change as you add and delete categories. 
Figure 3-4 shows that I currently have 23 categories for my blog.
 
 Clicking this link takes you to the Categories Page, where you can view, 
edit, and delete your current categories or add brand new ones. (For 
details about the management and creation of categories, see Chapter 4.)
 
✓ The number of tags: This is the current number of tags you have in your 
blog, which will change as you add and delete categories in the future. 
Figure 3-4 shows that I have 8 tags.
 
 Clicking this link takes you to the Tags page, where you can add new 
tags and view, edit, and delete your current tags. (You can find more 
information about Tags in Chapter 4.)
 
✓ The number of comments: This is the total number of the com-
ments that are currently on your blog. Figure 3-4 shows that I have 
6 Comments, 6 Approved, 0 Pending (waiting to be approved), and 0 
Spam. Clicking any of these four links takes you to the Edit Comments 
page, where you can manage the comments on your blog. I cover the 
management of comments in Chapter 4.
The last section of the Dashboard’s Right Now module in the Dashboard 
shows the following information:
 
✓ Which WordPress theme you’re using: Figure 3-4 shows that I’m using 
the Cutline theme. The theme name is a link that, when clicked, takes 
you to the Manage Themes page where you can view and activate 
themes on your blog.

41
 Chapter 3: Getting Started with WordPress.com
 
✓ How many widgets you’ve added to your blog: This is the number of 
WordPress widgets you’re using in your blog. Figure 3-4 shows that I 
have 8 widgets. The number is a link that, when clicked, takes you to 
the Widgets page, where you can change your widget options by edit-
ing them, moving them, or removing them. (I cover widgets in detail in 
Chapter 5.)
 
✓ Change Theme: Clicking this button takes you to the Manage Themes 
page, which lists your currently active and all available themes for your 
WordPress blog.
 
✓ Akismet Spam stats: This is the last statement in the Right Now section 
and it gives you a quick look into how many spam comments and track-
backs the Akismet application has successfully blocked from your site. 
Figure 3-4 shows that Akismet has protected my blog from 2,936 spam 
comments. It’s nice to know the spam protection is there, and working!
Recent Comments
The next module is Recent Comments. Within this module, you find
 
✓ Most recent comments published to your blog: WordPress displays a 
maximum of five comments in this area.
 
✓ The author of each comment: The name of the person who left the com-
ment appears below it. This section also displays the author’s picture 
(or avatar), if they have one.
 
✓ A link to the post the comment was left on: The post title appears to 
the right of the commenter’s name. Click the link, and you go to that 
post in the Administration panel.
 
✓ An excerpt of the comment: This is a short snippet of the comment left 
on your blog.
 
✓ Comment management links: Hover your mouse over the comment, and 
five links appear that give you the opportunity to manage those com-
ments right from your Dashboard (I discuss Comment management later 
in Chapter 4):

tion turned on.
 
• Edit: This link opens the Edit Comment page where you can edit 
the comment.
 
• Reply: This link displays a text box where you can quickly reply to 
the comment right from your Dashboard.

• Spam: Clicking this link marks that comment as spam.
 
• Delete: Clicking this link deletes the comment from your blog.
 
✓ View All button: This button invites you to see all the comments that 
have been left on your blog. Clicking the View All button takes you to the 
Edit Comments page, where you can view and edit, moderate, or delete 
any comments that have been left for your blog.
You’ll find even more information on managing your comments in Chapter 4.
Incoming Links
Directly to the right of the Recent Comments section in the Dashboard is the 
Incoming Links section, which lists all the blog-savvy people who wrote blog 
posts that link to your blog. Figure 3-4, earlier in this chapter, shows that I 
don’t have any incoming links to my blog. How sad is that? Because my blog 
is brand new, people haven’t discovered it yet, but I’m sure as soon as they 
do, my Incoming Links list will start filling up in no time.
In the meantime, a message in the Incoming Links section says, “This dash-
board widget queries Google Blog Search so that when another blog links to your 
site it will show up here. It has found no incoming links. . . yet. It’s okay — there 
is no rush.” The phrase Google Blog Search is underlined because it’s a link; 
when you click it, you go to the Google Blog Search page, which is a search 
engine for blogs only. 
Your Stuff
In the Your Stuff section of the Dashboard, you see the following sections:
 
✓ Today: Click the links here to go to a page with options that let you 
manage today’s posts. This page contains new or updated posts you’ve 
made during the current day.
 
✓ A While Ago: Click the links here to go to a page with options that let 
you manage posts and updates you made in past days.
What’s Hot
Last but not least, the What’s Hot section provides information about hap-
penings in and around WordPress.com, including WordPress.com news, top 
blogs, top posts, fastest-growing blogs, and the latest posts made to blogs on 
WordPress.com. This section helps you stay in touch with the WordPress.
com community as a whole.

 Chapter 3: Getting Started with WordPress.com
QuickPress
The QuickPress module is a handy form that allows you to write, save, and 
publish a blog post right from your WordPress Dashboard. The options are 
very similar to the ones I cover in the section on writing posts in Chapter 4.
Recent Drafts
If you’re using a brand new WordPress.com blog, the Recent Drafts module 
displays the message: There are no drafts at the moment. That is because you 
have not written any drafts. As time goes on, however, and you have written 
a few posts in your blog, you may save some of those posts as drafts to be 
edited and published at a later date. It is those drafts that will be shown in 
the Recent Drafts module. Figure 3-4 shows that I have 4 Recent Drafts show-
ing in this box.
WordPress displays up to five drafts in this module and displays the title of 
the post, the date it was last saved, and a short excerpt. Click the View All 
button to go to the Manage Posts page where you can view, edit, and manage 
your blog posts. Check out Chapter 4 for more information on that.
Stats
The last module of the Dashboard page is Stats (see Figure 3-5). It includes 
a visual graph of your blog stats for the past several days. These stats rep-
resent how many visitors your blog received each day. The right side of the 
Stats module shows some specific information:
 
✓ Top Posts: This display lists the most popular posts in your blog, deter-
mined by the number of visits each post received. It also shows you 
exactly how many times each post has been viewed. Figure 3-5 shows 
that my post titled About Lisa Sabin-Wilson has been viewed 70 times. 
You can click the title of a post, and WordPress loads that post in your 
browser window.
 
✓ Top Searches: This area tells you the top keywords and search phrases 
people used to find your blog in search engines. Figure 3-5 shows that 
people used these search phrases to find my blog: WordPress MU For 
Dummies and WordPress For Dummies. It’s nice to know how people are 
finding your site in the search engines!
 
✓ Most Active: This area tells you which posts in your blog are the most 
active, as determined by the number of comments left on each post. 
You can click the title of a post, and WordPress loads that post in your 
browser window.

If you find that you don’t use a few modules on your Dashboard page, you can 
completely get rid of them altogether by following these few steps:
 
1. Click the Screen Options button shown at the top of the Dashboard. 
 
 This button is located at the top of the Dashboard page, on the right 
side. Clicking this button drops down the Screen Options menu, display-
ing the title of each module with check boxes to the left of each title.
 
2. Deselect the module you want to hide on your Dashboard.
 
 The check mark is removed from the box and the module you deselected 
disappears from your Dashboard. If you have hidden one module and find 
later that you really miss having it on your Dashboard, you can simply 
enable that module again by selecting it from the Screen Options menu.

Setting Important Options 
Before You Blog
The options in this section help you get started and well on your way to man-
aging your own WordPress.com blog. In this section, you discover how to set 

45
 Chapter 3: Getting Started with WordPress.com
the primary options that personalize your blog, including creating your user 
profile, setting the date and time stamp (based on your own time-zone set-
tings), and uploading a picture of yourself.
Setting your General options
To begin personalizing your WordPress.com blog by setting the General 
options, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Settings menu in the navigation menu.
 
2. Click the General link on the Settings menu.
 
 The General Settings page opens (see Figure 3-6).
 
Figure 3-6: 
The General 
Settings 
page in the 
WordPress 
Admin-
istration 
panel.
 
 
3. Enter the name of your blog in the Blog Title text box.
 
 You can revisit this page any time and change the blog name as often as 
you like.

46
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
 
4. In the Tagline text box, enter a slogan or a motto that describes you or 
your blog.
 
 The tagline should be a short (one line) phrase that sums up the tone 
and premise of your blog. Figure 3-6 shows I used a quote from a song by 
a group called Timbuk 3: “The future’s so bright, I gotta wear shades.” 
Although my tagline doesn’t give you a description of my blog, it does 
give you an idea of my optimistic nature.
 
5. From the drop-down Language menu, choose the language in which 
you want to publish your blog.
 
 Below the drop-down menu is a link that says modify the interface 
language — referring to the language in the WordPress Administration 
panel. So you can have your blog published in English but have the 
Administration panel displayed in Spanish, for example.
 
6. Type your e-mail address in the E-Mail Address box.
 
 Enter the e-mail address that you used to sign up with WordPress.com. 
You can change this address, but be warned: If you change the e-mail 
address here, it won’t become active until you confirm that you are in 
fact the owner of said e-mail address. This confirmation is accomplished 
through a simple process: WordPress.com sends an e-mail to that 
address, providing a link you can click to confirm that you are the owner. 
This e-mail address is used for administrative purposes only, which con-
sists mainly of communication between you and WordPress.com.
Adjusting your Date and Time settings
After you configure the General options that I discuss in the preceding sec-
tion, you can use the last section of the General Settings page to set your 
local time, so that your blog posts are published with a time stamp in your 
own time zone no matter where in the world you are. Use the following 
options to establish your settings in this area, as shown in Figure 3-7.
 
✓ Timezone section: Choose your UTC time from the drop-down menu. This 
setting refers to the number of hours that your local time differs from 
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This setting ensures that all your blog 
posts and comments left on your blog are time-stamped with the cor-
rect time. If you’re lucky enough, like me, to live on the frozen tundra of 
Wisconsin, which is in the Central time zone (CST), you would choose –6 
from the drop-down menu because that time zone is 6 hours off UTC.
 
 If you’re unsure what your UTC time is, you can find it at the Greenwich 
Mean Time (http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com) Web site. GMT 
is essentially the same thing as UTC.

47
 Chapter 3: Getting Started with WordPress.com
 
 The Timezone option doesn’t update automatically for daylight saving 
time (DST). If you live in an area of the world that practices DST, you 
have to update the Timezone option manually when it occurs.
 
✓ Date Format: Select how you want to display the date. The default 
format is F j, Y (F = the full month name; j = the two-digit day; Y = the 
four-digit year), which gives you the output of January 1, 2008. Select a 
different format by clicking the circle to the left of the option. You can 
also customize the date display by selecting the Custom option and 
entering your preferred format in the text box provided. You can found 
out how to customize the date format here: http://codex.word
press.org/Formatting_Date_and_Time.
 
✓ Time Format: Select how you want to display the time. The default 
format is g:i a (g = the two-digit hour; i = the two-digit minute; a = lower-
case ante meridiem and post meridiem, or a.m. or p.m.), which gives you 
the output of 12:00 a.m. Select a different format by clicking the circle 
to the left of the option. You can also customize the date display by 
selecting the Custom option and entering your preferred format in the 
text box provided; find out how at http://codex.wordpress.org/
Formatting_Date_and_Time.
 
 You can format the time and date in several ways. Go to http://us3.
php.net/date to find potential formats at the PHP Web site.
 
✓ Week Starts On: From the drop-down menu, choose the day the week 
starts in your calendar. The display of the calendar in the sidebar of 
your blog is optional. If you choose to display the calendar, you can 
select the day of the week you want your calendar to start with.

Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of any page where you set new 
options. If you don’t click Save Changes, your settings aren’t saved, and 
WordPress reverts to the previous options. Each time you click the Save 
Changes button, WordPress reloads the current page, displaying the new 
options that you just set.
Setting your profile: Tell us 
a little about yourself
The next set of options you need to update is your profile. This area lets you 
configure your personal settings to individualize your WordPress.com blog 
and tell the world a little more about yourself. This blog is, after all, about 
you, and this is your opportunity to brag and promote!
To get started telling the world about yourself, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Users menu in the navigation menu.
 
2. Click the Your Profile link on the Users menu.
 
 The Profile page opens, as shown in Figure 3-8.
 
Figure 3-8: 
Upload a 
picture and

49
 Chapter 3: Getting Started with WordPress.com
You can adjust all sorts of personal settings to let your visitors get to know 
you better. You can be liberal with the information you want to share or as 
stingy as you want. It’s your blog, after all.
 
Choose carefully the information you share on your blog, especially if you 
have a public blog on WordPress.com — public blogs can (and are!) viewed by 
a worldwide audience! If you don’t want people to know your real name, use a 
nickname. If you don’t want to share a picture of yourself for fear of shattering 
computer monitors worldwide, you can choose not to upload any picture at 
all or to upload a picture of something that reflects the essence of you. (You 
can post a picture of a book if you’re an avid reader, a picture of a camera if 
you’re a photographer, and so on.) The options are endless, and no real rules 
apply to what type of personal information or how much of it you should (or 
should not) share with the rest of the Internet world. 
Make your blog your own. Stake your claim and mark your territory in this 
section! 
Personal options
In the first section of the Your Profile and Personal Options page, you can set 
four preferences for your blog:
 
✓ Visual Editor: Place a check in this box to indicate that you want to use 
the Visual Editor when writing your posts. Leave this box blank if you 
prefer not to use the Visual Editor. For information about the Visual 
Editor, including reasons why you would or would not want to use it, see 
Chapter 4.
 
✓ Admin Color Scheme: This option changes the colors in your 
WordPress Administration panel, which uses the Gray color scheme by 
default. The other option is Blue — the choice is yours!
 
✓ Keyboard Shortcuts: These shortcuts are designed to save you time nav-
igating through the different areas of the Dashboard and Administration 
panel. Click the More Information link to read about how you can use 
keyboard shortcuts in your WordPress.com Administration panel.
 
✓ Browser Connection: You can select whether use the HTTPS connection 
when visiting your WordPress.com Administration panel. HTTPS refers 
to a secure browser connection called SSL-encrypt, which protects your 
Internet connection and keeps out potential hackers.
 
✓ Interface Language: The Interface Language option refers to the lan-
guage that you want to set for the Administration panel only. Don’t con-
fuse this setting with the Language option on the General Settings page, 
which determines the language you publish your blog in. If you want 
to view the settings in your WordPress Administration panel in Italian 
but want your published blog to appear in English, you set the Interface 
Language option (shown in Figure 3-8) to Italian and the Language 
option (shown in Figure 3-6) to English. Capiche?

50
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
 
✓ Primary Blog: This option is the URL of your primary WordPress.com 
blog. Figure 3-8 shows that the URL of my primary WordPress.com blog 
is lswilson.wordpress.com. Because WordPress.com allows you to 
have several blogs under one account, if you have more than one blog, 
a drop-down menu appears here, and you can use it to choose the blog 
you want to set as your primary blog.
Name
The next section on this page is where you can input personal information 
such as your first and last names and your nickname, and choose how you 
want your name to be displayed publicly. Fill in the boxes with the informa-
tion requested.
Contact Info
In this section, you provide your e-mail address and other contact informa-
tion to tell your visitors who you are and where they may contact you.
Note that E-mail is the only required field here. This e-mail address is the one 
WordPress uses to notify you when you have new comments or new user reg-
istrations for your blog. The e-mail address that you signed up with is already 
listed here for you; if you’d like to change it, you need to do so on the General 
Settings page.
Aside from e-mail, you can provide your ID for various Internet chat programs 
such as Yahoo! IM, AIM (AOL Instant Messenger), and Jabber/Google Talk.
About Yourself
In this section, you can provide a little biography, as well as change the pass-
word for your blog. Figure 3-9 shows this section in detail.
 
Figure 3-9: 
Provide an 
informative 
bio and set 
your blog 
password.
 

51
 Chapter 3: Getting Started with WordPress.com
The two areas of this section are
 
✓ Biographical Info: Type your short bio in the text box provided here. 
Figure 3-9 shows that I provided a few details about myself and things I 
like to do (when I’m not blogging, that is). This information can be shown 
publicly if you are using a theme that displays your bio — so be creative!
 
✓ New Password: When you want to change the password for your blog, 
type your new password in the first text box (refer to Figure 3-9). To 
confirm your new password choice, type it again in the second text field.
 
 Directly below the two New Password text boxes is a little password 
helper. WordPress.com assists you in creating a secure password by 
giving you a tip about the password you have chosen. WordPress.com 
alerts you if the password is too short or not secure enough (by telling 
you that it’s Bad).
 
 When you create a new password, use a combination of letters, num-
bers, and symbols to make it hard for anyone to guess what it is (for 
example, aty89!#4j). When you have created a password that WordPress 
thinks is a good one, it says the password is Strong.
 
 Change your password frequently. I can’t recommend this practice strongly 
enough. Some people on the Internet make it their business to attempt to 
hijack blogs for their own malicious purposes. If you change your password 
monthly, you lower your risk by keeping the hackers guessing.
When you finish setting all the options on the left side of the Your Profile and 
Personal Options page, don’t forget to click the Update Profile button to save 
your changes.
My Picture
Want to show the world your pretty picture? In the My Gravatar section of 
the Your Profile and Personal Options page, you can upload a picture (or a 
gravatar, which is a graphical image of you) of yourself or an image that rep-
resents you. This section is located on the right side of the Your Profile and 
Personal Options page (refer to Figure 3-8, earlier in this chapter).
The picture/avatar that you insert into your WordPress.com is used in 
several ways:
 
✓ The WordPress.com Blog of the Day page at http://botd.word
press.com/top-posts, which lists the top posts from the top blogs 
of the day: If your blog is included in these lists, a smaller version of the 
picture you’ve uploaded to your profile appears next to the listing.
 
✓ The WordPress.com Hawt Post (or “hot” post) on its main page at 
http://wordpress.com: If the WordPress spotlight shines in your 
direction, your picture will be displayed here for your own 15 minutes of 
WordPress.com fame.

52
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
 
✓ The WordPress.com directory (by topic) of its community blogs: This 
directory is called the Tags page (http://wordpress.com/tags). 
Bloggers on WordPress.com can tag their posts with keywords that help 
define the topics of their posts; WordPress.com collects all those tagged 
posts and sorts them by name on the Tags page.
 
 At the On the Tag: Blogging page (http://wordpress.com/tags/
blogging), for example, you find the most recent posts that WordPress.
com bloggers have made on the topic of blogging. If your blog appears in 
this directory, so does a thumbnail of your picture.
Follow these steps to insert a picture or avatar into your profile:
 
1. Choose the image you want to attach to your profile, and save it to 
your computer.
 
 To be safe in your image selection, be sure to upload an image that is at 
least 128 pixels wide and 128 pixels tall: 128 x 128. Later in these steps, 
you see how you can crop a larger image to the perfect size.
 
2. In the My Gravatar section of the Profile page, click the Change Your 
Gravatar link.
 
 The Gravatar.com window appears where you click the Upload a New 
Image from Your Computer link that opens the Select File from Your 
Computer window.
 
3. Click the Browse button and select an image from your computer.
 
4. Click the Next button.
 
 No matter what size image you chose, the Gravatar.com page allows 
you to crop your image to the correct size and lets you decide which 
part of your image to use for your picture display. When you click the 
Next button, the crop image page appears, and you can crop (cut) your 
chosen picture to the right size to be used as an avatar or icon (see 
Figure 3-10).
 
5. Use the crop tool to highlight the area of the picture that you want to 
remain after cropping.
 
 In Figure 3-10, the box with a dotted line (the crop tool) outlines the 
image I’ve chosen to use. This dotted outline indicates the size the pic-
ture will be when I’m done cropping it. You can move that dotted box 
around to choose the area of the image you want to use as your avatar. 
The Gravatar.com crop tool gives you two previews of your cropped 
image on the right side of the window: Small Preview and Large Preview.
 
6. Click the Crop and Finish! button.
 
 The Choose a Rating page opens, where you can choose a rating for your 
new Gravatar. 

53
 Chapter 3: Getting Started with WordPress.com
 
7. Choose a rating.
 
 The rating system works very much like the movie rating system we’re 
all familiar with: G, PG, R, and X. A G rating means that your Gravatar is 
suitable for all ages, whereas an X rating means that your Gravatar con-
tains some unmentionables that you would not want any kids to see. Use 
your absolute best judgment here!
 
8. Choose an e-mail address.
 
 You can assign your Gravatar to a particular e-mail address so that your 
Gravatar images appear on any blog you comment on, provided you use 
your assigned e-mail address to do so.
 
 When you’re done, you get a message from Gravtar.com that says “Your 
new Gravatar is now being applied.” 
 
9. Click the X in the upper right corner of the window to return to the 
Profile page in your WordPress.Com administration panel.
 
 The Profile page now displays your newly uploaded Gravatar.
 
You can change your picture any time you want by revisiting the Profile page 
and following these steps to upload a new picture.

Writing and Managing Your Blog
In This Chapter
▶ Writing your first post and making it look nice
▶ Organizing and categorizing your blog
▶ Inviting friends and establishing their permissions
▶ Moderating discussions — even when you aren’t logged in
▶ Combating comment spam
▶ Deciding what shows up on your front page
▶ Protecting your blog’s privacy
▶ Initiating trusting relationships with OpenID
T
he first chapter in this part covers the signup process and a few impor-
tant settings and options that you configure when you first log in to your 
new WordPress.com blog. Now it’s time to make a blogger out of you. In this 
chapter, I show you the tools you need to write your first post. When you 
understand that process, the blogging world is right at your fingertips.
This chapter also shows you the basics of categorizing your posts and links, 
uploading images to your blog posts, setting discussion and reading options 
for your blog, using static pages, and managing your users and authors. I 
don’t have the space in this chapter to cover every option available, but I hit 
the high points of what you need to know.
Ready? Set? Blog!
In the Administration panel, click the Add New link on the Posts menu to 
display the Add New Post page, where you write, organize, and publish your 
first post. Start by thinking up a name for your post and entering it in the 
Title text box, shown in Figure 4-1. You can make the name snappy and fun if 
you want, but don’t be cryptic. Use titles that give your readers a basic idea 
of what they’re about to read in the posts. No set of hard-and-fast rules exists 
when it comes to creating titles for your blog posts, of course. Have fun with 
your title, and let it reflect your personality and style of writing. After giving 
your post a title, you can write the content of your post in the Post text box.

Figure 4-1: 
The area 
in which 
you write 
your post.
 
Post text box
Title text box
Visual tab
HTML tab
The area in which you write your post is in Visual Editing mode, as indicated 
by the Visual tab that appears above the text. Visual Editing mode is how 
WordPress provides WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) options for 
formatting. Rather than have to embed HTML code within your post, you can 
simply type your post, highlight the text you’d like to format, and click the 
buttons (shown in Figure 4-1) that appear above the box in which you type 
your post.
If you’ve ever used a word processing program such as Microsoft Word, 
you’ll recognize many of these buttons:
 
✓ Bold: Embeds the <strong> </strong> tag to emphasize the text in 
bold (example: bold text).
 
✓ Italics: Embeds the <em> </em> tag to emphasize the text in italics 
(example: italic text).
 
✓ Strikethrough: Embeds the <strike> </strike> tag to put a line 
through your text (example: strikethrough text).
 
✓ Unordered List: Embeds the <ul><li> </li></ul> tag to create an 
unordered, or bulleted, list.
 
✓ Ordered List: Embeds the <ol><li> </li></ul> tag that creates an 
ordered, or numbered, list.
 
✓ Blockquote: Inserts the <blockquote> </blockquote> tag to indent 
the selected paragraph or section of text.

57
 Chapter 4: Writing and Managing Your Blog
 
✓ Align Left: Inserts the <p align=“left”> </p> tag to align the 
selected paragraph or section of text against the left margin.
 
✓ Align Center: Inserts the <p align=“center”> </p> tag to position 
the selected paragraph or section of text in the center of the page.
 
✓ Align Right: Inserts the <p align=“right”> </p> tag to align the 
selected paragraph or section of text against the right margin.
 
✓ Insert/Edit Link: Applies the <a href=“ “> </a> tag to the selected 
text to create a hyperlink.
 
✓ Unlink: Removes a hyperlink from selected text.
 
✓ Insert More Tag: Inserts the <!--more--> tag to split the display on 
your blog page. It publishes the text written above this tag with a Read 
More link, which takes the user to a page with the full post. This feature 
is good for really long posts.
 
✓ Toggle Spellchecker: This is a perfect tool for you, if you make spelling 
errors while you type. Use it to check your spelling before you post.
 
✓ Toggle Full Screen Mode: Expands the Post text box to occupy the full 
height and width of your browser screen. Use this to focus on writing 
without being distracted by all the other options on the page. To bring 
that Post text box back to its normal state, click the Toggle Full Screen 
Mode button again, and voilà — it’s back to normal.
 
✓ Show/Hide Kitchen Sink: Displays a new formatting menu, providing 
options for underlining, font color, custom characters, undo and redo, 
and so on — a veritable kitchen sink full of options! I saw this option 
and thought, “Wow! WordPress does my dishes, too!” Unfortunately, 
the option’s name is a metaphor to describe the advanced formatting 
options available with the Visual Editor.
 
If you’d rather embed your own HTML and skip the Visual Editor, click the 
HTML tab that appears to the right of the Visual tab above the Post text box. 
If you type HTML in your post — using a table or embedding video files, for 
example — you have to click the HTML tab before you insert that code. If you 
don’t, the Visual Editor formats your code, and it most likely looks nothing like 
you intended it to.
At this point, you can skip to the “Publishing your post” section, later in this 
chapter, for information on publishing your post to your blog, or continue 
with the following sections to discover how to include images in your blog 
post and refine the options for your post.
 
WordPress.com has a nifty autosave feature that saves your work while you’re 
typing and editing a new post. If your browser crashes, or you accidentally 
close your browser window before you’ve saved your post, the post is there 
for you when you get back. Those WordPress.com folks are so thoughtful!

Inserting media files into your post
Pictures, images, video, and audio files can greatly enhance the content of a 
post by adding visual and/or auditory effects to the words that you’ve writ-
ten. Look right above the formatting buttons on the Write Post page (refer to 
Figure 4-1), and you see an Add Media toolbar. Have a look again; it’s pretty 
small, but it’s there! The Add Media toolbar has four small buttons:
 
✓ Add an Image
 
✓ Add Video
 
✓ Add Audio
 
✓ Add Media
 
✓ Add Poll
 
As of this writing, if you don’t have any blog space upgrades purchased for 
your account, you can only upload images (jpg, jpeg, png, gif), docu-
ments (pdf, doc) and presentations (ppt) files. If you’ve purchased a space 
upgrade, you can upload other files — audio (mp3, mp4a, wav) and video 
(avi, mp4, mpg, mov, wmv) files. Chapter 5 has information on the upgrades 
that are available for your WordPress.com blog.
Adding an image 
Adding an image or photo to your post is easy. Start by clicking the Add an 
Image button, which is the first button on the Add Media toolbar. The Add 
an Image window opens, letting you choose images from your hard drive or 
from the Web (see Figure 4-2).
To add an image from the Web after you click the Add an Image button, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the From URL tab.
 
2. Type the URL (Internet address) of the image in the Image URL text box.
 
 Type the full URL, including the http and www portion of the address. 
You can find the URL of any image on the Web by right-clicking it and 
selecting Properties.
 
3. Type a title for the image in the Image Title box.
 
 This gives the image a title so you can easily identify the image later 
when using the Media Library. A title also assists in search engine opti-
mization because WordPress inserts a <title> tag in the HTML markup 
that looks like this: title=“your image title here”, which helps 
search engines identify the type of content on your page.

4. (Optional) Type a description of the image in the Image Caption box.
 
 The description of the image provides image ALT tags, which help 
search engines find and list your site in their directories — so it’s a good 
idea to provide a description if you can. Some WordPress themes also 
display the caption directly underneath your image on your blog.
 
5. Choose your alignment option by selecting the None, Left, Center, or 
Right radio button.
 
6. Type a link or choose not to link the image:
 
• None: You don’t want to link the image to anything.
 
• Link to Image: You want to link the image to its individual URL or 
you can type any URL you like to link an image to another Web site 
or page.
 
7. Click the Insert into Post button.
To add an image from your hard drive after you click the Add an Image 
button, follow these steps 
 
1. Click the From Computer tab.
 
2. Click the Select Files button.
 
 A dialog box opens, letting you choose an image from your hard drive.

60
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
 
3. Choose an image or multiple images to upload.
 
4. Click Open.
 
 The image is uploaded from your computer to your Web server. 
WordPress displays a progress bar on the upload and displays an image 
options box when the upload is finished.
 
5. Edit the details for the image(s) by clicking the Show link that appears 
to the right of the image thumbnail.
 
 Clicking Show drops down a box (see Figure 4-3) that contains several 
image options:
 
• Title: Type a title for the image.
 
• Caption: Type a caption for the image (such as This is a flower 
from my garden).
 
• Description: Type a description of the image.
 
• Link URL: Type the URL you want the image linked to. Whatever 
option you choose determines where your readers go when they 
click the image you’ve uploaded:
 
 None: You don’t want the image to be clickable. 
 
 File URL: Readers can click through to the direct image itself. 
 
 Post URL: Readers can click through to the post that the image 
appears in. You can type your own URL in the Link URL text box.
 
• Alignment: Choose None, Left, Center, or Right. (See Table 9-1, 
in the following section, for styling information regarding image 
alignment.)
 
• Size: Choose Thumbnail, Medium, Large or Full Size.
 
6. Click the Insert into Post button.
 
 The HTML code needed to display the image within your published 
post is inserted automatically. The media uploader window closes and 
returns you to the Write Post page. (Alternatively, you can click the Save 
All Changes button to save the options you’ve set for the image(s) and 
then return at a later date to insert the image(s) in your post, without 
having to reset those options again.)
Along with inserting just one image into your post, you can use the media 
uploader to insert a full gallery of images. Go through the steps I outline in 
this section to upload images, but don’t click the Insert into Post button. 
Instead, click the Gallery link at the top of the media uploader window (refer 
to Figure 4-2).

61
 Chapter 4: Writing and Managing Your Blog
 
Figure 4-3: 
Setting 
options for 
the image 
after you 
upload it.
 
You can configure the options for each image by clicking the Show link to 
the right of the image (as explained in Step 3 of the preceding steps). When 
you’re done, click the Insert Gallery into Post button. A short piece of code is 
inserted that looks like this: [gallery]. That piece of code tells WordPress 
to display your gallery of images inside the post you are about to publish.
 
The interface that WordPress.com uses for file upload is Flash-based. Adobe 
Flash contains a specific set of multimedia technologies programmed to handle 
media files on the Web. Some browsers and operating systems aren’t config-
ured to handle Flash-based applications. If you experience difficulties with the 
media uploader, WordPress.com gives you a handy alternative method. In the 
media uploader (refer to Figure 4-2), click the Browser Uploader link to upload 
files in an interface that is not Flash-based.
Using audio, video, and other media files
The Add Media toolbar contains four other buttons:
 
✓ Add Video: Click this button and the media uploader box opens. In the 
URL box, type the URL for the video file you want to use in the URL field. 
WordPress.com also provides you instructions (and the correct code) for 
inserting a video from YouTube, Google Video, DailyMotion, and VodPod. 
Click the Insert into Post button to use that video in your blog post.

62
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
 
✓ Add Audio: Click the button and the media uploader box opens. In the 
URL box, type the URL for the audio file you want to use; then type the 
title of that file in the Title box. Click the Insert into Post button to insert 
a link to that audio file into your blog post.
 
✓ Add Media: Click the button and the media uploader box opens. In the 
URL box, type the URL for the media file you want to use; then type the 
title of that file in the Title box. Click the Insert into Post button to insert 
a link to that media file into your blog post.
 
✓ Add Poll: You can automatically set up an account with WordPress.
com’s sister company, Poll Daddy, to create and insert polls on your 
WordPress.com blog.
How do media files differ from image, video, and audio files? Media files 
include Microsoft PowerPoint presentation files (.ppt), Microsoft Word 
documents (.doc), and Adobe Portable Document Format (.pdf) files. While 
these types of files can also contain images, video, and audio files, you can 
use the media uploader to upload these files to your WordPress.com account 
so that you can display and link to them on your blog.
 
WordPress.com gives you 3GB of disk space for your free blog, and though 
it would take a lot of files to use up that amount of space, if you upload large 
image files, that space could go a lot quicker than you think. Keep the actual 
file size of the images you upload in mind when you use this feature; you can 
eat that disk space up before you know it.
Refining your post options
After you write the post, you can choose a few extra options before you pub-
lish it for the entire world to see. These settings are applied only to the post 
you’re working on; they don’t apply automatically to any future or past posts 
you make. You can find these options (see Figure 4-4) underneath and to the 
right of the Post text box. 
Here are the options:
 
✓ Excerpt: Excerpts are short summaries of your posts. Many bloggers use 
snippets to show teasers of their blog posts, thereby encouraging the 
reader to click the Read More link to read posts in their entirety. Type 
your short summary in the Excerpt box. Excerpts have no word limit, 
but the idea is to keep them short and sweet.
 
✓ Send Trackbacks: I discuss trackbacks in Chapter 2, if you want to 
refresh your memory banks on what they are. If you want to send a 
trackback to another blog, enter that blog’s Trackback URL in the Sent 
Trackbox To box. You can send trackbacks to more than one blog; just 
be sure to separate trackback URLs with spaces.

63
 Chapter 4: Writing and Managing Your Blog
 
✓ Discussion: Decide whether to allow readers to submit feedback through 
the comment system and whether to allow pings and trackbacks (read 
more about pings and trackbacks in Chapter 2) by selecting the boxes 
here or leaving them blank.
 
✓ Publish: These are the publishing options for your blog post. I cover 
these options in detail in the “Publishing your post” section.
 
✓ Tags: Tags are a nice feature of WordPress.com; they let you add search-
able and archived keywords for your posts in small subtopics. Type 
your chosen tags (or keywords) in the Tags box. Tags can be single 
words or several words; just make sure to separate tags with commas 
(for example: books, movies, pop culture, and entertainment).
 
✓ Categories: You can file your posts in different categories to orga-
nize them by subject. (See more about organizing your posts in the 
“Organizing Your Blog by Subject” section, later in this chapter.) Select 
the box to the left of the category name you want to use. Don’t see the 
category you need listed here? Click the Add New Category link at the 
bottom of the Categories box, and you can add a new category.
 
✓ Password Protect This Post: You can password-protect a post by enter-
ing a password in this box. When you do, you can share the password 
with only the readers you want to let read that post. This feature is 
perfect for those times when you’d love to make a blog post about all 
the stupid things your boss did today but don’t want your boss to see it. 
This feature also hides the post from search engines so that it doesn’t 
show up in search results. If you don’t want to password-protect the 
post, leave this box blank.
 
When you finish setting the options for your post, don’t navigate away from 
this page, because your options have not yet been fully saved. You need to 
scroll all the way back up to the top and click the Save Draft button on the 
top right side of the page. Before you do that, however, you probably want to 
check out the next section, which discusses publishing options for your new 
blog post.
Publishing your post
You have given your new post a title and written the content of your new 
blog post. Maybe you’ve even added an image or other type of media file to 
your blog post and have configured the tags, categories, and other options 
for your post. Now the question is: Publish? Or not to publish (yet)?
WordPress.com gives you three options for saving or publishing your post 
when you are done writing it. Figure 4-5 shows the Publish Status section, 
which is located on the right side of the Write Post page.

The Publish Status drop-down menu offers three options:
 
✓ Status: Click the Edit link next to the Status option and a new menu 
appears with the following options:
 
• Pending Review: Select this option to set the post status as Pending; 
the post shows up in your list of drafts next to a Pending Review 
header. This option lets the administrator of the blog know that 
contributors have entered posts that are waiting for administrator 
review and approval (helpful for blogs with multiple authors).
 
• Draft: Select this option to save the post, but not publish it to your 
blog. Your post is saved in draft form, allowing you to return at a 
later time.
 
 Click OK when you’re done to save your settings.

65
 Chapter 4: Writing and Managing Your Blog
 
✓ Visibility: Click the Edit link next to the Visibility option and a new menu 
appears with the following options:
 
• Public: Choosing this option publishes your post to your blog for the 
entire world to see. Choose Stick This Post to Your Front Page if you 
want to publish this post to the very top of your blog, and keep it 
there until you come back and edit the status at a later date.
 
• Password Protected: This option allows you to password protect a 
post, which publishes it to your blog; however; for a reader to view 
the post, they have to know the password. When you select this 
option, a text box appears where you type the password for this post.
 
 Click OK when you’re done to save your settings.
 
✓ Publish Immediately: Click the Edit link next to the Publish Immediately 
option and a new menu appears where you can set the date (or time-
stamp) of the post and publish the post right away. The date settings 
here allow you to set a date in the future for the post to publish, or you 
can back-date a post to publish on a date in the past.
 
 Click OK when you are done to save your settings.
When you have chosen a publishing status, click the Publish button. 
WordPress saves your publishing-status option. Figure 4-6 shows my new 
blog post successfully posted to my blog.

If you want to publish your blog post right away, skip the drop-down menu 
options, and click the Publish button, which sends your new blog post to your 
blog in all its glory.
 
If you click Publish and for some reason don’t see the post you just published 
to the front page of your blog, you probably left the Publish Status drop-down 
menu set to Unpublished. Look for your new post among the draft posts.
Organizing Your Blog by Subject
Categorizing your posts in WordPress provides an organizational structure 
for your blog. Each blog post that is assigned to a category is grouped with 
other posts in the same category. When your blog is a few months old, this 
structure creates a nice topical directory of posts for you and your readers.
Category lists generally appear in two places on your blog, letting your read-
ers find all your posts by subject very easily. Almost all WordPress themes 
list categories within the blog post itself. Most themes also provide a list of 
your categories in the sidebar of your blog so that your readers can click a 
topic of interest.
Each category in a WordPress.com blog has its own RSS feed, making it easy 
for your readers to subscribe to a feed and keep updated on what you have 
to say in your blog about a certain topic.
Creating categories and subcategories
A brand-new WordPress.com blog has only one category to begin with: 
Uncategorized, as shown in Figure 4-7. 
You can create new categories (and categories within those categories) by 
following these steps:
 
1. Click the Categories link on the Posts menu.
 
 The Categories page opens (refer to Figure 4-7).
 
2. Under the Add Category heading, type the name of your category in 
the Category Name text box. 
 
3. Leave the Category Parent drop-down menu set to the default option 
(None).

67
 Chapter 4: Writing and Managing Your Blog
 
 The Category Parent drop-down menu lets you create subcategories. If 
you have a main category called Books, for example, Books appears in 
the Category Parent drop-down menu. To create a subcategory of the 
Books category, follow Steps 1 and 2 and then choose Books from the 
Category Parent drop-down menu.
 
4. (Optional) Enter a description of the category in the Description 
text box.
 
 Do this step now so that later, you’ll know what you were thinking of 
when you created this category. A short summary will do. (Also, some 
WordPress themes are coded to display the category description in the 
sidebar of your blog.)
 
5. Click the Add Category button.
 
Categories you create now aren’t set in stone. You can edit or delete them by 
revisiting the Categories page and clicking the name of the category you want 
to edit. The Edit Category page opens, and you can edit the category name, 
category parent, and description.

Filing posts in categories 
and subcategories
The preceding section tells you how to create categories and subcategories. 
When you’ve created those categories and subcategories, you don’t ever 
have to re-create them — they are always there for you to assign your blog 
posts to.
To assign existing posts to a category, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Edit link in the Posts menu.
 
 The Edit Posts page appears, displaying a list of posts you’ve made.
 
2. Click the name of the post you want to categorize.
 
 The Edit Post page opens, displaying your post content and saved 
options.
 
3. In the Categories section to the right of the Post text box, select the 
check box next to the category or subcategory (you can select more 
than one category and subcategory) that you want to assign to the post.
 
 You can also use the Categories section before you publish a new post 
to assign it to the categories you’d like.
 
4. Scroll up to the top of the Edit Post page, and click the Update Post 
button.
 
 WordPress.com refreshes the Edit Post page, displaying the post you 
just edited; it reflects the changes you just made.
Creating and Categorizing Your Blogroll
A blogroll is a list of links that you display on your blog. In this section, I show 
you how to add and manage the links in your blogroll.
To view your default blogroll, click the Links menu. The Edit Links page 
opens and you see the default links that are already included in your 
WordPress.com blog. See Figure 4-8.
 
If you want to remove a link from your blogroll, select the box to the left of the 
link name; select Delete from the Bulk Actions drop-down menu at the top of 
the page, then click the Apply button (refer to Figure 4-8).

Creating link categories
WordPress.com lets you have an unlimited number of link categories on your 
blog. Link categories, much like the post categories discussed earlier in this 
chapter, provide you a way of separating your blogrolls (or list of links) into 
topical categories.
By default, WordPress.com sets up a link category for you called — by no 
coincidence — Blogroll. To add a new category, click the Link Categories link 
on the Links menu.
You add a new link category the same way you add new post categories (see 
the “Creating categories and subcategories” section, earlier in this chapter).
Adding new links to your blogroll
To add a new link to your blogroll, click the Links subtab and then click the 
Add New link. The Add New Link page opens, as shown in Figure 4-9.

70
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
 
Figure 4-9: 
Add a link to

by using 
this tool 
from Word
Press.com.
 
Follow these steps to add your new link:
 
1. In the Name text box, type the name of the Web site you’re adding.
 
2. In the Web Address text box, type the URL, making sure to include the 
http:// part.
 
3. (Optional) In the Description text box, type a short description of the 
Web site.
 
4. In the Categories box, select the box to the left of the category you 
want this link to appear in.
 
5. (Optional) Select the target for your link in the Target box.
 
 The target tells your browser how you want this link to load in your visi-
tor’s browser window after the visitor clicks it. You have three choices:
 
• _blank: Loads the link in a new browser window.
 
• _top: Loads the link in the top frame (if your site is designed with 
frames).
 
• None: Loads the link in the same browser window (the default set-
ting, should you choose to overlook the Target option).

71
 Chapter 4: Writing and Managing Your Blog
 
 The third option — None — is my personal preference and recommen-
dation. I like to let my visitors decide whether they want a bunch of new 
browser windows to open every time they click a link on my site.
 
6. (Optional) Select the Link Relationship (XFN) option, and define why 
you’re providing this link.
 
 XFN stands for XHTML Friends Network and allows you to indicate the 
relationship you have with the people you are linking to by defining how 
you know, or are associated with, them. Table 4-1 lists the different rela-
tionships you can assign to your links.
 
7. (Optional) Select advanced options for your link in the Advanced box:
 
• Image Address: This option associates an image with the link, and 
some WordPress themes display the image on your site along with 
the link. Type the URL for the image in the Image Address box. For 
this purpose, you need to know the direct URL to the image (for 
example, http://yourdomain.com/images/image.jpg).
 
• RSS Address: Type the RSS feed URL for the blog you are linking to. 
WordPress displays the link to the site’s RSS feed alongside the 
link that appears on your site. Not all WordPress themes accom-
modate this feature.
 
• Notes: Type your notes in the Notes box. These notes aren’t dis-
played on your site, so feel free to leave whatever notes you need 
to further define the details of this link. A month from now, you 
may not remember who this person is or why you linked to her, so 
you can add notes to remind yourself.
 
• Rating: Use the Rating drop-down menu to rate this link from 0 
to 10, 0 being the worst and 10 being the best. Some WordPress 
themes display your blogroll in the order in which you’ve rated 
your links, from best to worst.
 
8. Scroll to the top of the page, and click the Save button.
 
 Your new link is saved, and a blank Add New Link page opens, ready 
for you to add another new link to your blogroll(s). Additionally, in the 
Save section at the top right, you can choose to keep this link private — 
this option, if checked, will not display the link publicly on your blog. It 
would be kept protected and for your eyes only.

You can find more information on XFN at http://gmpg.org/xfn.
Revisit the Manage Links page any time you want to add a new link, edit an 
old link, or delete an existing link. You can create an unlimited amount of 
blogroll categories to sort your blogrolls by topics. I know one blogger who 
has 50 categories for his links, so the options are limitless.
Managing and Inviting Users
What’s a blog without blog users? Of course, your WordPress.com blog 
always has at least one user: you. To see your list of users, click the Users 
link that is in the navigation menu. The Users page opens and the Users menu 
expands to show three different links:
 
✓ Authors & Users
 
✓ Your Profile (See Chapter 3 for information on the Profile page.)
 
✓ Invites 

73
 Chapter 4: Writing and Managing Your Blog
Managing authors and users
The Users page tells you about all the users on your blog. It lists each user’s 
username, name, e-mail address, role on your blog, and number of posts 
made to your blog. This page also has the Add User from Community sec-
tion, where you can add a new user to your blog. (By user, WordPress means 
simply a person who is a member of your blog as a contributor, an author, 
an editor, or an administrator. You can have an unlimited amount of users on 
one WordPress.com blog.)
To manage user roles, you need to understand the distinct differences among 
the roles. The following list explains the type of access each role provides:
 
✓ Contributor: A Contributor can upload files and write/edit/manage her 
own posts. When a Contributor writes a post, however, that post is 
saved as a draft to await administrator approval; Contributors can’t pub-
lish their posts. This feature is a nice way to moderate content written 
by new authors.
 
✓ Author: In addition to having the access and permissions of a 
Contributor, an Author can publish his own posts without administrator 
approval. Authors can also delete their own posts.
 
✓ Editor: In addition to having the access and permissions of an Author, 
an Editor can moderate comments, manage categories, manage links, 
edit pages, and edit other Authors’ posts. Editors can also read and edit 
private posts.
 
✓ Administrator: An Administrator has the authority to change any of 
the Administration options and settings in the WordPress blog. You, as 
the account owner, are listed as an Administrator already. You can also 
assign other users as Administrators.
WordPress.com lets you have an unlimited amount of users and authors on 
one blog, which is a nice feature if running a multiauthor blog is something 
you’d like to do.
At the bottom of the Authors & Users page, in the Add User from Community 
section, you can add new users to your blog. Enter the person’s e-mail 
address, assign a user role, and click the Add User button. The user you 
add must be a registered user in the WordPress.com system. If you enter 
someone who isn’t registered, WordPress.com gives you the option to send 
that person an invitation to become a member. (The WordPress people have 
thought of everything, haven’t they?)

74
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
To change a user’s role, follow these steps:
 
1. Find that person’s username on the Users page.
 
2. Select the box next to the username.
 
3. From the Change Role To drop-down menu at the top the page, choose 
the role you want to assign; then click the Change button.
 
 The Users page refreshes with the new role assignment applied.
To view all the posts made by an author, click the number that appears 
below the Posts column for that user.
Inviting friends to WordPress.com
Now that you’ve experienced the fun, ease, and excitement of having your 
very own WordPress.com blog, why not tell your friends, so that they can tell 
their friends, and their friends can tell their friends, and so on?
Click the Invites link on the Links menu, and you can do just that. Figure 
4-10 shows the form that lets you invite people you know to sign up for 
WordPress.com accounts. You can also tell WordPress to add a user to 
your blogroll after she joins. Additionally, you can tell WordPress to add the 
new member to your own blog as a Contributor, if you want. (This option 
is especially helpful if you’re setting up new users or authors for your own 
WordPress.com blog.)
Follow these instructions to invite as many people as you want to join 
WordPress.com:
 
1. Click the Invites link on the Users menu.
 
 The Invites page opens.
 
2. In the appropriate text boxes, type the user’s first name, last name, 
and e-mail address.
 
3. Type a personal message to the prospective member in the Personal 
Message text box, or use the default message WordPress.com provides.
 
4. (Optional) Select the Add to My Blogroll after Signup check box if you 
also want to add this person to your own WordPress.com blogroll.
 
5. (Optional) Select the Add User to My Blog as a Contributor check box if 
you want to add this user to your blog as a Contributor after he signs up.

75

6. Click the Send Invite button to send the invitation to the prospective

When you complete these steps, WordPress sends you confirmation that the 
invitation was sent.

Managing Comments and 
Comment Spam
As I describe in Chapter 2, comments provide a great way for readers to 
interact with you, and vice versa. Readers of your blog can post comments 
by using the comment form that appears on the same page as each of the 
published posts on your blog. You need to be able to exercise control over 
the comments that appear, however.

Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
Setting discussion options for your blog
Click the Discussion link on the Settings menu. On the Discussion Settings 
page, you can set the options, such as notification settings, for your 
posts; determine how comments and comment spam are handled on your 
WordPress.com blog; and specify whether you want to use avatars on your 
blog. The Discussion Settings page has six settings you can configure for your 
blog, each of which I discuss in the following sections.
 
When you’re done setting up your options, click the Save Changes button at 
the bottom of the page to make the changes take effect. You can revisit this 
page as often as you need to so you can keep your settings current and to 
your liking.
Default Article Settings
The Default Article Settings section is where you tell WordPress.com how to 
handle post notifications. Three options are available to you:
 
✓ Attempt to Notify Any Blogs Linked to from the Article (Slows Down 
Posting): Enabled by default, this option makes your blog send a notifica-
tion, via a ping, to any site you’ve linked to in your blog post. This feature 
is very similar to a trackback (which I discuss in Chapter 2) and can slow 
the process of posting just a bit, because of the time it takes for your blog 
to talk to another blog to let it know that you’re talking about it.
 
✓ Allow Link Notifications from Other Blogs (Pingbacks and 
Trackbacks): Enabled by default, this option tells WordPress that you 
want your blog to be notified via pings and trackbacks that other people 
have linked to you. WordPress lists any ping and trackback notifications 
on your site as comments in the Comments section. If you deselect this 
option, your ears may tingle, but you won’t know when other people are 
talking about, or linking to, you on other blogs.
 
✓ Allow People to Post Comments on the Article: Enabled by default, this 
option lets people leave comments on your blog.
Other Comment Settings
The Other Comment Settings tell WordPress how to handle comments:
 
✓ Comment Author Must Fill Out Name and E-Mail: Enabled by default, 
this option requires the comment author to fill in the name and e-mail 
fields on your comment form in order to leave a comment on your blog.
 
✓ Users Must Be Registered and Logged In to Comment: With this 
selected, anyone who wants to leave a comment on your blog must be 
a registered user of your blog, and must be logged in before they can 
leave a comment. This option is deselected by default.

77
 Chapter 4: Writing and Managing Your Blog
 
✓ Automatically Close Comments on Articles Older Than X days: This 
option helps decrease spam comments on older posts. You can select 
this option and then enter the number of days (for example: 30) in the 
text box provided.
E-Mail Me Whenever
The two options in the E-Mail Me Whenever section, Anyone Posts a 
Comment and A Comment Is Held for Moderation, are selected by default. 
This feature tells WordPress that you want to receive an e-mail any time 
anyone leaves a comment on your blog and/or any time a comment is await-
ing your approval in the moderation queue. This feature can be very helpful, 
particularly if you don’t visit your blog daily. Everyone likes to get comments 
on his blog posts, and it’s good to be notified when it happens so that you 
can revisit that post, respond to your readers, and keep the conversation 
active. You can disable this feature, however, by deselecting these options.
Before a Comment Appears
The three options in the Before a Comment Appears section tell WordPress 
how you want WordPress to handle comments before they appear in your blog:
 
✓ An Administrator Must Always Approve the Comment: Selecting this 
option holds every new comment on your blog in the moderation queue 
until you log in and approve it. This feature is particularly helpful if you 
want to review the content of comments before they’re published to 
your blog.
 
✓ Comment Author Must Have a Previously Approved Comment: When 
this box is selected, the only comments that are approved and pub-
lished on your blog are those that have been left by commenters who 
have already been approved by you. Their e-mail addresses are stored 
in the database, and WordPress runs a check on their e-mails. If the 
e-mail address matches a previously approved comment, the new com-
ment is published automatically. If no match occurs, WordPress places 
the comment in the moderation queue, awaiting your approval. This 
measure is yet another feature that helps prevent comment spam.
Comment Moderation
In the Comment Moderation section, you can set options to specify what 
types of comments are held in the moderation queue to await your approval. 
Frequently, comment spammers try to spam your blog with a ton of links in 
the hope of promoting their own sites through your comment form. You can 
set the number of links that are allowed in a comment before it is tossed into 
the moderation queue to await approval. The default is 2. Give that a try, and 
if you find that you’re getting lots of spam comments with multiple links, you 
may want to revisit this page and increase that number.

78
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
The text box below the link setting is where you can set keywords, URLs, 
e-mail addresses, or IP addresses to be flagged for moderation. One popular 
topic that comment spammers like to spam with is Viagra; they fill their com-
ments with links to sites where you can purchase Viagra. Really, if you wanted 
to know about those sites, wouldn’t you seek them out? Well, that’s beside 
the point. If you’re getting a lot of Viagra spam, you can enter Viagra in the 
Comment Moderation list rather than in the Comment Blacklist list, because 
you might actually receive a legitimate comment with the word Viagra in it that 
you would like to approve. A visitor to my blog left a comment — “Espresso 
is Viagra for my brain!” — in response to a post I made about my love for 
espresso. That comment is legitimate but probably got thrown into my 
moderation queue because I have that term in my Comment Moderation list.
 
By default, WordPress.com automatically discards spam on older posts on 
your blog. You can switch this option off by checking the Don’t Discard Spam 
on Old Posts box at the top of this section.
Comment Blacklist
In contrast to the Comment Moderation list, the Comment Blacklist is a list 
of words, URLs, e-mail addresses, and IP addresses that you want to flat-out 
ban from ever making it to your blog. Items placed here don’t even make it 
into your Comment Moderation queue; they’re filtered as spam by the system 
and completely disregarded. The words I have placed in my Blacklist are not 
family friendly and have no place in a nice book like this.
 
Are you getting the feeling that comment spam is a real issue for bloggers? 
It’s huge — probably bigger than you imagine it to be. Much of the comment-
spam prevention is done behind the scenes, so you don’t even see half of 
what’s going on. All the options on the Discussion Settings page are geared 
toward decreasing or eliminating comment or trackback spam from your blog. 
If, during the course of your blogging experience on WordPress.com, you find 
that you’re having an issue with spam, you may want to revisit these options 
and make adjustments.
Avatars
Avatars are photos or images that represent your commenters (and you) on 
your blog. Figure 4-12, later in this chapter, shows a small avatar to the left 
of the comment. You can choose to display avatars on your blog by selecting 
the Show Avatars option. You can also set the maximum rating for the ava-
tars, much like the movie rating system we’re all used to. If your site is family 
friendly, you probably don’t want to display R- or X-rated avatars on your 
site. You can select G, PG, R, or X ratings for the avatars that display on your 
site. You can also select an image to use as the default avatar for those users 
who do not yet have avatars assigned to their e-mail.

79
 Chapter 4: Writing and Managing Your Blog
 
For WordPress.com users, the avatars displayed are the images they uploaded 
to their profiles (see Chapter 3). Users who are not registered with WordPress.
com still have the option of having an avatar displayed when they comment 
on your blog by signing up for one at http://gravatar.com.
Viewing comments
You open the Edit Comments page by clicking the Comments menu. The Edit 
Comments page shows all the comments on your blog, from the very first 
day you started. Here, you can view the comments, edit them, mark them as 
spam, or flat-out delete them.
If you’ve set your Comments options so that comments aren’t published until 
you approve them, you can approve comments in this section as well. To 
accomplish this task, of course, you have to have comments on your blog, 
and if your blog is new, you may not have any yet. Figure 4-11 shows what a 
comment looks like in this area.
 
Figure 4-11:

the Manage 
Comments 
page.
 

80
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
To manage a comment, find one that you want to edit, delete, unapprove (or 
remove it from your blog page), or mark as spam. If you need to, you can find 
a specific comment by using the search feature. Just type a keyword in the 
search box located in the top-right corner of the page and click the Search 
Comments button.
When you’ve found the comment you want to manage, hover your mouse 
over the comment and six different links appear beneath the comment text, 
and include: 
 
✓ Approve or Unapprove: If the comment has not yet been approved, the 
Approve link appears here. Click Approve to publish the comment to 
your blog. If the comment was approved, click the Unapprove link to . . . 
well, unapprove it. This link puts the comment back into the moderation 
queue. 
 
✓ Spam: This link tells WordPress that this comment is spam and removes 
it from your blog.
 
✓ Delete: This link deletes the comment from your blog.
 
✓ Edit: Clicking this link takes you to the Edit Comment page where you can 
edit the text of the comment, if you need to (correcting typos anyone??)
 
✓ Quick Edit: This link accomplishes the same as the Edit link except 
instead of taking you to a new Edit Comment page, it drops down a quick 
edit text box that allows you to do a fast edit right on the same page.
 
✓ Reply: This link drops down a text box on the same page to allow you to 
reply to the comment right from the Edit Comments page.
Managing comment spam with Akismet
Comment spam, as I discuss in Chapter 2, is a sneaky method that spammers 
are fond of using to post links to their sites on yours. Akismet is the answer 
to combating comment and trackback spam; it kills spam dead. Created by 
the Automattic team, headed by Matt Mullenweg, Akismet is a “collaborative 
effort to make comment and trackback spam a non-issue and restore inno-
cence to blogging, so you never have to worry about spam again,” according 
to Akismet.com.
Click the Spam link on the Edit Comments page to view the comments and 
trackbacks that were caught by Akismet’s spam filters. Akismet keeps the 
past two weeks’ worth of comments and trackbacks that were stopped by its 
filters because the rare legitimate comment can get caught up in the spam fil-
ters. If that happens, you can visit this section and de-spam the comment by 
clicking the Not Spam button.

81
 Chapter 4: Writing and Managing Your Blog
I usually don’t have to visit the Akismet Spam page. My readers usually are 
pretty quick to let me know if they’ve left a comment that didn’t get pub-
lished. In such a case, I check the Akismet Spam page to see whether it was 
caught in the spam filters. Then I de-spam it and move on.
Creating a Static Page
You can create pages on your blog that are treated differently from posts. 
These pages, called static pages, appear as separate pages on your blog 
rather than posts within your blog. You use nearly the same process of writ-
ing a static page as you do to write a post. You can easily create an unlimited 
number of static pages, which can serve as nice complements to your overall 
site content.
You can use this feature to write, for example, an About Me page, on which 
you give all the wild and wooly details about yourself. (See Figure 4-12 for an 
example of an About page.) If you use the Page Sidebar widget, the pages you 
create are listed in your sidebar. (See Chapter 5 for more about widgets.)
 
Figure 4-12: 
The author’s 
About page.
 

82
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
You can create these pages by logging into your WordPress.com 
Administration panel and following these steps:
 
1. Click the Add New link in the Pages menu.
 
 The Add New Page page appears where you can compose your static page.
 
2. Type the title of your page in the Title text box.
 
3. Type the body of your page in the Page text box.
 
 You can use the Virtual Text Editor and insert media files into your page 
by using the same techniques discussed in the “Ready? Set? Blog!” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter.
 
4. Set the options for your page by using the option boxes below the 
Page text box.
 
 To display these boxes, click the white arrow to the left of each option 
title. The following options appear:
 
• Discussion: By default, the Allow Comments and Allow Pings boxes 
are selected. Deselect them if you don’t want to allow comments or 
pings.
 
• Parent: Choose the page parent from the drop-down menu if you 
want to make the static page a subpage of another page you’ve 
created.
 
• Template: If the WordPress.com theme you’re using has page tem-
plates available, choose from this drop-down menu the template 
you want to use for the page.
 
• Order: Enter a number in the text box that reflects the order in 
which you want this page to display on your site. If you want this 
page to be the third page listed, for example, enter 3.
 
• Page Author: Choose the author of this blog from the drop-down 
menu. This step isn’t necessary if you’re the only author of this 
blog; if you have multiple authors, however, you may find this 
option helpful.
 
5. Scroll back to the top of the page, and choose options from the 
Publish Status drop-down menu.
 
 These options are the same as the Publish Status options that are 
available when you’re writing a new blog page. I covered the available 
options in the “Ready? Set? Blog!” section earlier in this chapter. 
 
6. Click the Save or Publish button when you’re done to save your work.
Your static pages aren’t included in your Recent Posts list, in categories, or 
in your monthly archive.

83
 Chapter 4: Writing and Managing Your Blog
Setting Up Your Front Page
On the Reading Settings page (click the Reading link in the Settings menu), 
you can set how many blog posts show up on the front page of your blog 
and/or change your front page to display a static page rather than displaying 
your most recent blog posts. (See the “Creating a Static Page” section, ear-
lier in this chapter, for more information on creating static pages.) You can 
also determine how many blog posts your readers can see in your RSS feed. 
Figure 4-13 shows the options that are available.
 
Figure 4-13: 
The Reading 
Settings 
page.
 
The Reading Settings page gives you control of the settings that let you make 
these decisions for your blog:
 
✓ Front Page Displays: This setting determines what appears on the front 
page of your site.
 
• Your Latest Posts: Select this option if you want your blog posts to 
display on the front page of your blog.
 
• A Static Page: Select this option if you want a static page to display 
on the front page of your blog.

84
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
 
• Front Page: If you choose to display a static page, choose from this 
drop-down menu which page to display.
 
• Posts Page: If you choose to display a static page, use this drop-
down menu to tell WordPress which page to display your posts on.
 
✓ Blog Pages Show at Most X Posts: If you choose to display your blog 
posts on your front page, this step is where you set the number of blog 
posts to display per page. Figure 4-14, in the following section, shows 
that I’ve decided to display ten posts on my front page.
 
✓ Syndication Feeds Show the Most Recent X Posts: This setting deter-
mines how many posts show in your RSS feed at one time. See the next 
section for details.
 
✓ For Each Article in a Feed, Show: Indicate here which portion of each 
article you want to show in your feed:
 
• Full Text: Select this radio button if you want the entire text of each 
post to be displayed in your RSS feed.
 
• Summary: Select this radio button if you want only excerpts of your 
posts to be displayed in your RSS feed.
 
✓ For Each Article in an Enhanced Feed, Show: Here, you have the option 
of showing several more details about your blog, as well as giving the 
reader the opportunity to add your article to several social bookmark 
sites:
 
• Categories
 
• Tags
 
• Comment Count
 
• Add to Stumbleupon
 
• Add to Del.icio.us
 
• Add to Digg.com
 
• Add to Reddit
 
✓ Encoding for Pages and Feeds: UTF-8 is the default, and recommended, 
character encoding for your blog. Character encoding is code that han-
dles the storage and transmission of the text from your blog through 
the Internet connection. Your safest bet is to leave the default in place, 
because it is the most commonly accepted character encoding and sup-
ports a wide range of languages.
When you change any settings in the Reading Settings page, make sure that 
you click the Save Changes button in the bottom-left corner to save your 
preferences.

 Chapter 4: Writing and Managing Your Blog
Publishing a Public or Private Blog
This section contains one very simple option for you to set; this option lets 
you determine how you want to deal with publicity on your blog. Figure 4-14 
shows your choices. To access the privacy options for your blog, click the 
Privacy link on the Settings menu. You can choose one of these three options 
in the Privacy Settings page:

✓ I Would Like My Blog to Be Visible to Everyone, Including Search 
Engines (Like Google, Sphere, Technorati) and Archivers: Select this 
option if you want to freely allow search engines to visit your blog and 
include its content in their search directories.
 
✓ I Would Like to Block Search Engines, but Allow Normal Visitors: 
Select this option if you don’t want search engines to visit and include 
your site in their directories. This option is helpful if you want normal 
(read: human) visitors but don’t want the publicity that search engines 
provide.

86
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
 
✓ I Would Like My Blog to Be Visible Only to Users I Choose: Select this 
option if you want to make your blog available only to the people you 
choose. This option keeps your blog completely private and away from 
prying eyes — except for those users you allow.
 
 When you select and save this option, WordPress.com provides a form 
where you can enter the WordPress.com usernames for the people you 
want to invite to view your private blog. (WordPress.com lets you add 
up to 35 users at no cost; you can pay an annual fee to add more.)
When you finish making your decision, be sure to click the Save Changes 
button to make the changes take effect.
Establishing Trust Relationships 
with OpenID
OpenID is a third-party, Internet-community identification system that lets 
an Internet user create an online identity that she can use anywhere on the 
Web where OpenID is supported. With WordPress.com, you already have an 
OpenID identity.
In the WordPress Administration panel, click the OpenID link on the Settings 
menu to see the OpenID Trusted Sites page, which tells you what your 
OpenID is. (It’s usually your main WordPress.com domain: http://user
name.wordpress.com.) You can also add the URLs of what you consider to 
be trusted sites. After you enter the URL of a trusted site and click the Add to 
List button, you aren’t asked whether you trust the site when you attempt to 
log in to it. In a nutshell, this setting means that you can use your WordPress.
com OpenID to log in to any Web site that supports OpenID.

Chapter 5
Enhancing Your Blog with Themes, 
Widgets, and Upgrades
In This Chapter
▶ Giving your blog a new look
▶ Adding widgets to your sidebar
▶ Upgrading your free WordPress.com blog
You don’t want your blog to look identical to everyone else’s, do you? 
Although WordPress.com doesn’t give you the vast array of design options 
that you’d have by hosting your own blog, you do have some flexibility. 
The great thing about the WordPress hosted service is how easily you can 
change your theme to one of the alternative designs available. What’s not so hot 
is that you can’t create your own custom theme. As noted later in this chapter, 
you can pay a fee to customize the CSS of the template you’ve chosen to use, 
but you need to be familiar with CSS to use this upgrade — and there again, 
you’re limited to customizing only the templates that WordPress provides.
In this chapter, you discover the WordPress.com themes that let you choose 
a design and format for your blog. You have some fabulous themes to choose 
among, all created by WordPress users. At this writing, 70 themes are avail-
able. You also explore the fun of using sidebar widgets to rearrange how your 
blogroll, category and monthly archive lists, and page lists are displayed.
This chapter also discusses enhancing your blog with custom CSS (Cascading 
Style Sheets), choosing a domain name, and increasing the amount of hard drive 
space on your WordPress.com account through its upgrade feature (for a fee).
Changing Your Blog’s Look
It’s time to choose a theme for your WordPress.com blog. In this case, the 
word theme is synonymous with the words design and template. All three words 
describe the very same things: the visual layout and appearance of your blog.

88
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
Follow these steps to find your theme:
 
1. In your Administration panel, click the Themes link on the 
Appearance menu.
 
 A page full of themes appears (as shown in Figure 5-1), along with a 
thumbnail image of the theme so that you can get a basic idea of what it 
looks like.
 
2. Scroll through the themes, and when you find a theme you like, click 
its name or the thumbnail image associated with it.
 
 You can page through the list of available themes by using the handy 
buttons at the top-right and bottom-right corners of the Available 
Themes section. Or you can use the drop-down menu in the top-left 
corner of the Available Themes section to filter your theme choices by 
color, columns, width, and option (refer to Figure 5-1).
 
 What happens next is pretty nifty! A box pops up, showing you a pre-
view of what your own blog would look like with that particular theme.
 
3. Click the Activate link in the top-right corner to activate the theme on 
your own blog, or click the X in the top-left corner if you decide you’d 
rather not use that theme.
 
Figure 5-1: 
Choose a

your blog.
 

89
 Chapter 5: Enhancing Your Blog with Themes, Widgets, and Upgrades
No, really — it’s just that easy. If you get tired of that theme, go to the Design 
tab and click a different theme name, and you’re done. 
It really is that easy!
Widget Wonder: Adding Handy 
Tools to Your Sidebar
WordPress widgets are very helpful tools built into the WordPress.com appli-
cation. They allow you to easily arrange the display of content in your blog 
sidebar, such as your blogroll(s), recent posts, and monthly and category 
archive lists. With widgets, arrange and display the content in the sidebar of 
your blog without having to know a single bit of PHP or HTML.
Selecting and activating widgets
Click the Widgets link on the Appearance menu in your Administration panel. 
The Widgets page displays the available widgets, as shown in Figure 5-2. This 
feature is a big draw because it lets you control what features you use and 
where you place them — all without having to know a lick of code.
On the left side of the Widgets page is a listing of all widgets available for 
your WordPress.com blog.
On the right side of the Widgets page are the widgets you’re using in your 
sidebar. Figure 5-2 shows that I am using the following widgets in my sidebar:
 
✓ Recent Posts
 
✓ Categories
 
✓ Archives
The Widgets page also includes a drop-down menu in the Current Widgets sec-
tion (refer to Figure 5-2). If you’re using a theme that has only one sidebar, the 
Widgets page has only one sidebar for you to configure. If you are using a theme 
with two sidebars (usually called a three-column layout), use the drop-down 
menu to toggle between Sidebar 1 and Sidebar 2. When you want to configure 
widgets for Sidebar 1, be sure that Sidebar 1 is selected in the drop-down menu; 
when you want to configure widgets for the second sidebar, choose Sidebar 2. 
Click the Show button to load the widgets for that sidebar on your screen.

To add a new widget to your sidebar, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose the widget you want to use.
 
 You find all the widgets are listed in the Available Widgets section. For 
the purpose of these steps, choose the Archives widget.
 
2. Click the Add link to the right of the widget’s title.
 
 The widget is placed in the Current Widgets section. An Edit link also 
appears to the right of the widget’s title.
 
3. Click the Edit link to configure the options for this widget.
 
 Each widget has different options that you can configure. The Archives 
widget, for example, lets you configure the title, the display of the post 
counts, and the display of the archives (see Figure 5-3).
 
4. Select your options and click the Done button.
 
 The options menu for the widget closes.
 
5. Click the Save Changes button.
 
 Your configurations for all of your widgets are saved.
 
6. Arrange your widgets in the order in which you want them to appear 
on your site by clicking a widget and dragging it above or below 
another widget.

91
 Chapter 5: Enhancing Your Blog with Themes, Widgets, and Upgrades
 
 Repeat this step until your widgets are arranged the way you want them.
 
7. Click the Save Changes button when you’re done configuring your 
widgets.
 
 WordPress saves all your changes and reloads the Widgets page with a 
confirmation message at the top that says Changes Saved.
To remove a widget from your sidebar, click the Edit link on the widget you 
want to remove, and then click the Remove button. WordPress removes the 
widget from the Current Widgets list on the right side of this page and places 
it back in the Available Widgets list.
After you’ve selected and configured all your widgets, click the Visit Site 
button at the top of your WordPress Administration panel (you’ll see it to the 
right of your site name), and your blog’s sidebar matches the content (and 
order of the content) you’ve arranged in the sidebar on the Widgets page. 
How cool is that? You can go back to the Widgets page and rearrange the 
items, as well as add and remove items, to your heart’s content.

Using Text widgets
The Text widget in WordPress.com is a little bit different from the rest of the 
widgets you encounter on the Widgets page. Add the Text widget just as you 
would any other, using the steps I outline in the preceding section. After you 
have it settled in the sidebar, click the Edit link that appears next to the widget 
name. A text box drops down to let you type text or insert code (see Figure 5-4).

92
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
 
Figure 5-4:

text box.
 
You have no real options to configure, but you can use this simple text box 
for several things. Here are a couple of examples of what you can use a Text 
widget for:
 
✓ Type a short paragraph of text, such as a bio.
 
✓ Insert the HTML code to display an image in your sidebar. (See Chapter 
13 for some information on basic HTML codes you can use.)
Using the RSS widget
The RSS widget lets you display content from another blog in your sidebar. If 
I wanted to display a list of recent posts from another blog that I have some-
where else, for example, I would use the RSS widget to accomplish this task. 
Follow these steps to add the RSS widget to your blog:
 
1. Add the RSS widget to your sidebar on the Widgets page.
 
 Follow the steps in the “Selecting and activating widgets” section, earlier 
in this chapter, to add the widget.
 
2. Click the Edit link to the right of the RSS widget’s name.
 
 A box drops down, displaying the different options you can configure for 
the RSS widget.
 
3. In the Enter the RSS URL Here text box, type the RSS URL of the blog 
you want to add.
 
 You can usually find the RSS Feed URL of a blog listed in the sidebar.
 
4. Type the title of the RSS widget.

93
 Chapter 5: Enhancing Your Blog with Themes, Widgets, and Upgrades
 
 This title is what will appear in your blog above the links from this blog. 
If I wanted to add the RSS feed from my personal blog, for example, I 
would type Lisa Sabin-Wilson’s blog.
 
5. (Optional) Select the Display the Item Content box.
 
 Checking this box tells WordPress that you also want to display the con-
tent of the feed (usually, the content of the blog post from the feed URL). 
If you want to display only the title, leave the box unchecked.
 
6. (Optional) Select the Display Item Author, If Available box.
 
 Select this option if you want to display the author’s name along with 
the item’s title.
 
7. (Optional) Select the Display Item Date box.
 
 Select this option if you want to display the date the item was published, 
along with the item title.
 
8. Click the Save Changes button.
 
 WordPress saves all the options you’ve just set and reloads the Widgets

Upgrading Your Hosted Service 
(For a Fee)
Although WordPress.com is a free service, it offers enhancements for a fee. 
WordPress.com calls these items upgrades, and you can purchase credits for 

94
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
them at the cost of $1 (USD) per credit. (The prices I give here are current as 
of this book’s printing, but they are, of course, subject to change.) Click the 
Upgrades menu to display the Upgrades page, shown in Figure 5-6.
Following is a list of the current upgrades you can purchase to enhance your 
WordPress.com account, with the prices reflecting the annual cost:
 
✓ Custom CSS: This upgrade lets you customize the Cascading Style 
Sheets (CSS) for the theme you’re currently using in the WordPress.com 
system. Recommended for users who understand the use of CSS, this 
upgrade currently costs 15 credits ($15 USD).
 
✓ Unlimited Private Users: With a free account, you’re limited to 35 private 
users — if you choose to publish your WordPress.com blog as a private 
blog — giving access to only those users whom you authorize. This 
upgrade removes that limit, letting you have unlimited private users for 
your blog (provided that those users are already WordPress.com account 
holders). The cost is 30 credits ($30 USD).
 
✓ Additional Space: With the free WordPress.com blog, you have 3GB of 
hard drive space for use in your upload directory. The various space 
upgrades add more, letting you upload more files (images, videos, audio 
files, and so on). Currently, you can add 5GB for 20 credits ($20 USD), 
15GB for 50 credits ($50 USD), or 25GB for 90 credits ($90 USD).
 
✓ No Ads: For the cost of 30 credits ($30 USD) per year, you can ensure 
that your WordPress.com blog is ad-free. Occasionally, WordPress.com 
does serve ads on your blog pages to try and defray the costs of running 
a popular service. If you’d rather not have those ads appearing on your 
blog, pay for the No Ads upgrade and you’ll be ad-free!
Giving the gift of WordPress.com
If you are feeling especially generous, and you 
have a favorite blogger who uses the WordPress.
com hosted service, you can practice what I like 
to call WordPress philanthropy — that is, send a 
gift to your friend in the form of WordPress.com 
account upgrades.
On the Upgrades page (refer to Figure 5-6), click 
the Gifts tab. On that tab, choose a dollar or 
credit amount; enter your friend’s WordPress.
com username or e-mail address; and then 
write your friend a little note before you click 
the Give Credits button.
Nothing says “I like you” more than a 
WordPress.com upgrade.

Naming Your Domain
The URL for your WordPress.com blog is http://username.wordpress.
com, with username being your username. My username is designs; there-
fore, my WordPress.com domain is http://designs.wordpress.com.
WordPress.com lets you use your own domain name for your WordPress.com 
blog. Using the Domains feature in WordPress.com is not free, however. At this 
writing, this feature costs 10 credits per year (credits currently cost $1 each).
 
The $10 fee associated with the Domains feature in WordPress.com doesn’t 
include the cost of registering the domain name. That cost is separate. With 
the Domains upgrade, you’re paying for WordPress to forward your domain 
name to your WordPress blog. You can find more information about domain 
registration in Chapter 6.

96
Part II: Using the WordPress Hosted Service 
When you have your domain registered, go to your WordPress.com 
Administration panel, click the Domains link on the Upgrades menu, click the 
Domains tab, and type your domain name in the Add a Domain text box (see 
Figure 5-7). Then follow the prompts to fully set up your domain name.

When you’ve configured your domain name correctly, your old WordPress.
com URL redirects to your new domain name. If my domain name is 
LisaSabin-Wilson.com, my WordPress.com blog at http://designs.
wordpress.com redirects to http://lisasabin-wilson.com.
 
At this writing, you don’t pay WordPress.com for the Domain upgrade until 
the domain is working correctly in your WordPress.com account.

tell you how to get your own domain name and Web 
host and take you through the installation procedure and 
features of the Administration panel that you’ll want to

Chapter 6
Setting Up Blogging Base Camp
In This Chapter
▶ Finding and buying a domain name
▶ Finding Web hosting
▶ Brushing up on FTP
▶ Installing WordPress
B
efore you can start blogging with WordPress.org, you have to set up 
your base camp. Doing so involves more than simply downloading and 
installing the WordPress software. You also need to establish your domain 
(your blog address) and your Web hosting service (the place that houses your 
blog). Although you initially download your WordPress software onto your 
hard drive, your Web host is where you install it.
Obtaining a Web server and installing software on it are much more involved 
projects than simply obtaining an account with the hosted version of 
WordPress that’s available at WordPress.com (covered in Part II). You have 
to consider many factors in this undertaking, as well as cope with a learning 
curve, because setting up your blog through a hosting service involves using 
some technologies that you may not feel comfortable with at first. This chapter 
takes you through the basics of those technologies, and by the last page of this 
chapter, you’ll have WordPress successfully installed on a Web server with 
your own domain name.
Establishing Your Domain
You’ve read all the hype. You’ve heard all the rumors. You’ve seen the flashy 
blogs on the Web powered by WordPress. But where do you start?
The first steps toward installing and setting up a WordPress blog are making 
a decision about a domain name and then purchasing the registration of that 
name through a domain registrar. A domain name is the unique Web address 
that you type in a Web browser’s address bar to visit a Web site. Some exam-
ples of domain names are WordPress.org and Google.com.

100
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
I emphasize the word unique because no two domain names can be the same. If 
someone else has registered the domain name you want, you can’t have it. 
With that in mind, it sometimes takes a bit of time to find a domain that isn’t 
already in use and is available for you to use. You have alternatives, of course. 
You could contact the owner of the domain name you want and find out 
whether it’s for sale and how much the owner will sell it for. With this 
approach, however, chances are that you’ll pay way more for the domain name 
than if you’d purchased an available domain name through a domain registrar.
Understanding domain name extensions
When registering a domain name, be aware of the extension that you want. 
The .com, .net, .org, .info, or .biz extension that you see tagged onto 
the end of any domain name is the top-level domain extension. When you reg-
ister your domain name, you’re asked to choose the extension you want for 
your domain (as long as it’s available, that is).
A word to the wise here: Just because you have registered your domain 
as a .com doesn’t mean that someone else doesn’t, or can’t, own the very 
same domain name with a .net. So if you register MyDogHasFleas.com, and 
it becomes a hugely popular site among readers with dogs that have fleas, 
someone else can come along and register MyDogHasFleas.net, and run a 
similar site to yours in the hope of riding the coattails of your Web site’s 
popularity and readership.
You can register your domain name with all available extensions if you want 
to avert this problem. My business Web site, for example, has the domain 
name EWebscapes.com; however, I also own EWebscapes.net, EWebscapes.
biz, and EWebscapes.info.
Domain names: Do you own or rent?
In reality, when you “buy” a domain name, you 
don’t really own it. Rather, you’re purchasing 
the right to use that domain name for the period 
of time specified in your order. You can reg-
ister a domain name for one year or up to ten 
years. Be aware, however, if you don’t renew 
the domain name when your registration period 
ends, you lose it — and most often, you lose 
it right away to someone who preys on aban-
doned or expired domain names. Some people 
keep a close watch on expiring domain names, 
and as soon as the buying window opens, they 
snap the names up and start using them for their 
own Web sites, in the hope of taking full advan-
tage of the popularity that the previous owners 
worked so hard to attain for those domains.

101
 Chapter 6: Setting Up Blogging Base Camp
Considering the cost of a domain name
Registering a domain costs you anywhere from $3 to $30 per year, depending 
on what service you use for a registrar and what options (such as privacy 
options and search-engine submission services) you apply to your domain 
name during the registration process.
 
When you pay the domain registration fee today, you need to pay another reg-
istration fee when the renewal date comes up again in a year, or two, or five — 
however many years you chose to register your domain name for. (See the 
“Domain names: Do you own or rent?” sidebar.) Most registrars give you the 
option of signing up for a service called Auto Renew. This service automati-
cally renews your domain name and bills the charges to the credit card you 
have set up on that account. The registrar sends you a reminder a few months 
in advance, telling you it’s time to renew. If you do not have Auto Renew set 
up, you need to log in to your registrar account before it expires and manually 
renew your domain name.
Registering your domain name
Domain registrars are certified and approved by the Internet Corporation for 
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Although hundreds of domain reg-
istrars exist today, the ones in the following list are popular because of their 
longevity in the industry, competitive pricing, and variety of services they 
offer in addition to domain name registration (such as Web hosting and Web 
site traffic builders):
 
✓ GoDaddy: http://GoDaddy.com
 
✓ Register.com: http://register.com
 
✓ Network Solutions: http://networksolutions.com
 
✓ NamesDirect: http://namesdirect.com
No matter where you choose to register your domain name, here are the 
steps you can take to accomplish this task:
 
1. Decide on a domain name.
 
 Doing a little planning and forethought here is necessary. Many people 
think of a domain name as a brand — a way of identifying their Web sites 
or blogs. Think of potential names for your site; then you can proceed 
with your plan.

102
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
2. Verify the domain name’s availability.
 
 In your Web browser, enter the URL of the domain registrar of your 
choice. Look for the section on the registrar’s Web site that lets you enter 
the domain name (typically, a short text field) to see whether it’s avail-
able. If the domain name isn’t available as a .com, try .net or .info.
 
3. Purchase the domain name.
 
 Follow the domain registrar’s steps to purchase the name using your 
credit card. After you complete the checkout process, you receive an 
e-mail confirming your purchase, so be sure to use a valid e-mail address 
during the registration process.
The next step is obtaining a hosting account, which I cover in the next section.
 
Some of the domain registrars have hosting services that you can sign up 
for, but you don’t have to use those services. Often, you can find hosting ser-
vices for a lower cost than most domain registrars offer. It just takes a little 
research.
Finding a Home for Your Blog
When you have your domain registered, you need to find a place for it to live — 
a Web host. Web hosting is the second piece of the puzzle that you need to 
complete before you begin working with WordPress.org.
A Web host is a business, group, or individual that provides Web server space 
and bandwidth for file transfer to Web site owners who don’t have it. Usually, 
Web hosting services charge a monthly or annual fee — unless you’re for-
tunate enough to know someone who’s willing to give you server space and 
bandwidth for free. The cost varies from host to host, but you can obtain 
quality Web hosting services for $3 to $10 per month to start.
Web hosts consider WordPress to be a third-party application. What this 
means to you is that the host typically won’t provide technical support on 
the use of WordPress (or any other software application), because support 
isn’t included in your hosting package. Although most Web hosts attempt to 
assist you with the use of the software, ultimately, the responsibility for run-
ning it on your server account is all yours. This condition is one of the big 
reasons that some folks opt to run a WordPress-powered blog on the hosted 
version at WordPress.com. If you’ve chosen to go the self-hosted route with 
the WordPress.org software, you can find help and support on the use of 
WordPress in the WordPress support forums located at http://word
press.org/support/.

103
 Chapter 6: Setting Up Blogging Base Camp
 
Several Web hosting providers also have WordPress-related services available 
for additional fees. These services can include technical support, plugin instal-
lation and configuration, and theme design services.
Hosting services generally provide (at least) these services with your 
account:
 
✓ Hard drive space
 
✓ Bandwidth (transfer)
 
✓ Domain e-mail with Web mail access
 
✓ File Transfer Protocol (FTP) access
 
✓ Comprehensive Web site statistics
 
✓ MySQL database(s)
 
✓ PHP
Because you intend to run WordPress on your Web server, you need to look 
for a host that provides the minimum requirements needed to run the soft-
ware on your hosting account, which are
 
✓ PHP version 4.3 (or greater)
 
✓ MySQL version 4.0 (or greater)
 
The easiest way to find out whether a host meets the minimum requirement is 
to check the FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section of the host’s Web site, 
if it has one. If not, find the contact information for the hosting company, and 
fire off an e-mail requesting information on exactly what it supports. Any Web 
host worth dealing with will answer your e-mail within a reasonable amount of 
time (12–24 hours is a good barometer).
Getting help with hosting WordPress
The popularity of WordPress has given birth to services on the Web that 
emphasize the use of the software. These services include WordPress design-
ers, WordPress consultants, and — yes — Web hosts that specialize in using 
WordPress.
Many of these hosts offer a full array of WordPress features, such as an 
automatic WordPress installation included with your account, a library of 
WordPress themes, and a staff of support technicians who’re very experi-
enced in using WordPress.

104
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
Here is a list of some of those providers:
 
✓ Blogs About Hosting: http://blogs-about.com
 
✓ Laughing Squid: http://laughingsquid.net
 
✓ AN Hosting: http://anhosting.com
 
✓ DreamHost: http://dreamhost.com
 
A word about Web hosts and domain registration: A few Web hosting providers 
offer free domain name registration when you sign up for their hosting services. 
Research this topic and dig through those hosting providers’ terms of service, 
because that free domain name sometimes comes with a few conditions.
Many of my clients have gone this route, only to find out a few months later —
when they’re unhappy with the unreliable hosting service and would like to 
change to another host — that the Web hosting provider has full control of 
the domain name, and they aren’t allowed to move that domain off the host’s 
servers, either for a set period (usually, a year or two) or for infinity. I feel that 
it’s always best to have the control in your hands, not someone else’s, so I rec-
ommend registering your domain name yourself with an independent domain 
registrar, such as GoDaddy.
Dealing with disk space and bandwidth
Web hosting services provide two very important things with your account:
 
✓ Disk space
 
✓ Bandwidth transfer
Think of your Web host as a garage that you pay to park your car in. The 
garage gives you the place to store your car (disk space). It even gives you 
the driveway so that you, and others, can get to and from your car (band-
width). It won’t, however, fix your rockin’ stereo system (WordPress or any 
other third-party software application) that you’ve installed — unless you’re 
willing to pay a few extra bucks for that service.
Managing disk space
Disk space is nothing more complicated than the hard drive on your own 
computer. Each hard drive has the capacity, or space, for a certain amount of 
files. An 80GB (gigabyte) hard drive can hold 80GB of data — no more. Your 
hosting account provides you a limited amount of disk space, and the same 

105
 Chapter 6: Setting Up Blogging Base Camp
concept applies. If your Web host provides you 10GB of disk space, that’s the 
limit on the file size that you’re allowed to have. If you want more disk space, 
you need to upgrade your space limitations. Most Web hosts have a mecha-
nism in place for you to upgrade your allotment.
Starting out with a self-hosted WordPress blog doesn’t take much disk space 
at all. A good starting point for disk space is between 3–5GB of storage space. 
If you find that you need additional space in the future, contact your hosting 
provider for an upgrade in space.
 
Time for a public-service announcement: A good Web host has a system in 
place that sends you a warning (via e-mail) when you reach at least 80 percent 
of your total disk space capacity. This warning helps you manage the space 
in your hosting account. With this warning, you can plan on either doing 
some account maintenance of your own and clearing out some unnecessary 
files that may be taking up space, or getting in contact with your Web host to 
upgrade your account.
Choosing the size of your bandwidth pipe
Bandwidth refers to the amount of data that is carried from point A to point 
B within a specific period (usually, only a second or two). I live out in the 
country — pretty much the middle of nowhere. The water that comes to my 
house is provided by a private well that lies buried in the backyard some-
where. Between my house and the well are pipes that bring the water to my 
house. The pipes provide a free flow of water to our home so that everyone 
can enjoy their long, hot showers while I labor over dishes and laundry, all at 
the same time. Lucky me!
The very same concept applies to the bandwidth available with your host-
ing account. Every Web hosting provider offers a variety of bandwidth limits 
on the accounts it offers. When I want to view your Web site in my browser 
window, the bandwidth is essentially the pipe that lets your data flow from 
your “well” to my computer and appear on my monitor. The bandwidth 
limit is kind of like the pipe connected to my well: It can hold only a certain 
amount of water before it reaches maximum capacity and won’t bring the 
water from the well any longer. Your bandwidth pipe size is determined by 
how much bandwidth your Web host allows for your account — the larger 
the number, the bigger the pipe. A 50MB bandwidth limit makes for a smaller 
pipe than does a 100MB limit.
Web hosts are pretty generous with the amount of bandwidth they provide 
in their packages. Like disk space, bandwidth is measured in gigabytes (GB). 
Bandwidth provision of 10–50GB is generally a respectable amount to run a 
Web site with a blog.

106
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
Web sites that run large files — such as video, audio, or photo files — gener-
ally benefit from higher disk space compared with sites that don’t involve 
large files. Keep this point in mind when you’re signing up for your hosting 
account. Planning now will save you a few headaches down the road.
Transferring Files from 
Point A to Point B
This section introduces you to the basic elements of File Transfer Protocol 
(FTP). The ability to use FTP with your hosting account is a given for almost 
every Web host on the market today. FTP is the method you use to move files 
from one place to another — for example, from your computer to your Web 
hosting account. This method is referred to as uploading.
Using FTP to transfer files requires an FTP client. Many FTP clients are avail-
able for download. Following are some good (and free) ones:
 
✓ WS_FTP: www.ipswitch.com/_download/wsftphome.asp
 
✓ SmartFTP: www.smartftp.com/download
 
✓ FileZilla: http://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla
 
✓ FTP Explorer: www.ftpx.com
Earlier in this chapter, in “Finding a Home for Your Blog,” you find out how 
to obtain a Web hosting account. Your Web host gives you a username and 
password for your account, including an FTP IP address. (Usually, the FTP 
address is the same as your domain name, but check with your Web host, as 
addresses may vary.) It is this information — the username, password, and 
FTP IP address — that you insert into the FTP program to connect it to your 
hosting account.
Figure 6-1 shows my FTP client connected to my hosting account. The direc-
tory on the left is the listing of files on my computer; the directory on the 
right shows the listing of files on my hosting account.
FTP clients make it easy to transfer files from your computer to your hosting 
account by using a drag-and-drop method. You simply click the file on your 
computer that you want to transfer, drag it over to the side that lists the 
directory on your hosting account, and drop it. Depending on the FTP client 
you’ve chosen to work with, you can refer to its user manuals or support 
documentation for detailed information on how to use the program.

Installing WordPress
By the time you’re finally ready to install WordPress.org, you should have 
done the following things:
 
✓ Purchased the domain name registration for your account
 
✓ Obtained a hosting service on a Web server for your blog
 
✓ Established your hosting account username, password, and FTP address
 
✓ Acquired an FTP client for transferring files to your hosting account
If you’ve missed any of the items listed, you can go back to the beginning of 
this chapter to reread the portions you need.
Some Web hosts now offer a one-click installation process for WordPress. If 
this is the case for you, you can simply follow the instructions provided by 
your Web host. The instructions in this section are for those of you who are 
doing a manual install of WordPress on your Web server.

108
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
If you have to install WordPress manually, here’s where the rubber meets the 
road — that is, you’re putting WordPress’s famous five-minute installation to 
the test. Set your watch, and see whether you can meet that five-minute mark.
 
The famous five-minute installation includes the time it takes to install the 
software only. It does not include the time to register a domain name; the 
time to obtain and set up your Web hosting service; or the time to download, 
install, configure, and learn how to use the FTP software.
Without further ado, go get the latest version of the WordPress software 
here: http://wordpress.org/download.
 
WordPress gives you two compression formats for the software: zip and 
tar.gz. I recommend getting the zip file, as it’s the most common format for 
compressed files.
Download the WordPress software to your computer, and decompress (or 
unpack, or unzip) it to a folder on your computer’s hard drive. These steps 
are the first in the installation process for WordPress. Having the program on 
your own computer isn’t enough, however; you also need to upload (transfer) 
it to your Web server account (the one you obtained in “Finding a Home for 
Your Blog,” earlier in this chapter). Before installing WordPress on your Web 
server, you need to make sure that you have a MySQL database all set up and 
ready to accept the WordPress installation. The next section tells you what 
you need to know about MySQL.
Setting up the MySQL database
The WordPress software is a personal publishing system that uses a PHP-
and-MySQL platform, which provides everything you need to create your own 
blog and publish your own content dynamically without having to know how 
to program those pages yourself. In short, all your content (options, posts, 
comments, and other pertinent data) is stored in a MySQL database in your 
hosting account.
Every time visitors go to your blog to read your content, they make a request 
that’s sent to your server. The PHP programming language receives that 
request, obtains the requested information from the MySQL database, and 
then presents the requested information to your visitors through their Web 
browsers.
Every Web host is different in how it gives you access to set up and manage 
your MySQL database(s) for your account. A popular account administration 
interface in use today is called cPanel (shown in Figure 6-2), and in this sec-
tion, I use cPanel. If your host provides a different interface, the same basic 
steps apply; just the setup in the interface that your Web host provides may 
be different.

109
 Chapter 6: Setting Up Blogging Base Camp
 
Figure 6-2: 
cPanel is a 
Web host-
ing account 
manager 
provided 
by several 
Web hosting 
companies.
 
To set up the MySQL database for your WordPress blog with cPanel, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Log in to the administration interface with the username and pass-
word assigned to you by your Web host.
 
 I’m using the cPanel administration interface, but your host may provide 
NetAdmin or Plesk, for example.
 
2. Locate the MySQL Database Administration section.
 
 In cPanel, click the MySQL Databases icon.
 
3. Choose a name for your database, and enter it in the Name text box.
 
 Be sure to make note of the database name, because you will need it 
during the installation of WordPress later.
 
 It doesn’t really matter what you choose for the database name, user-
name, or password. For security reasons, however, make sure that your 
password isn’t something that sneaky hackers can easily guess. Usually, 
I give my database a name that I will easily recognize later. This practice 
is especially helpful if you’re running more than one MySQL database 
in your account. If I name this database something like WordPress or 
wpblog, I can be reasonably certain — a year from now, when I want to 
access my database to make some configuration changes — that I know 
exactly which one I need to deal with.

110
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
4. Click the Create Database button.
 
 You get a message confirming that the database has been created.
 
5. Click the Go Back link or the Back button on your browser toolbar.
 
6. Choose a username and password for your database, enter them in 
the Add New User text boxes, and then click the Create User button. 
 
 You get a confirmation message that the username was created with the 
password you specified.
 
 Make absolutely sure that you note the database name, username, and 
password that you set up during this process. You will need them in the 
next section before officially installing WordPress on your Web server. Jot 
them down on a piece of paper, or copy and paste them into a text-editor 
window; either way, just make sure that you have them immediately handy.
 
7. Click the Go Back link or the Back button on your browser toolbar.
 
8. In the Add Users to Database section, choose the user you just set up 
from the User drop-down menu; then choose the new database from 
the Database drop-down menu.
 
 The MySQL Account Maintenance, Manage User Privileges page appears 
in cPanel.
 
9. Assign user privileges by selecting the All Privileges check box.
 
 Because you’re the administrator (owner) of this database, you need to 
make sure that you assign all privileges to the new user you just created.
 
10. Click the Make Changes button. 
 
 A page opens with a confirmation message that you’ve added your 
selected user to the selected database. 
 
11. Click the Go Back link.
 
 You go back to the MySQL Databases page.
Uploading the WordPress files
To upload the WordPress files to your host, return to the folder on your com-
puter where you unpacked the WordPress software that you downloaded 
earlier. You’ll find all the files you need (shown in Figure 6-3) in a folder 
called /wordpress.
Using your FTP client, connect to your Web server, and upload all these files 
to your hosting account, into the root directory.

111
 Chapter 6: Setting Up Blogging Base Camp
 
Figure 6-3: 
WordPress 
software 
files to be 
uploaded to 
your Web

If you don’t know what your root directory is, contact your hosting provider 
and ask, “What is my root directory for my account?” Every hosting provider’s 
setup is different. On my Web server, my root directory is the public_html 
folder; some of my clients have a root directory in a folder called httpdocs. 
The answer really depends on what type of setup your hosting provider has. 
When in doubt, ask!
Here are a few things to keep in mind when you’re uploading your files:
 
✓ Upload the contents of the /wordpress folder to your Web server — 
not the folder itself. Most FTP client software lets you select all the files 
and drag ’n’ drop them to your Web server. Other programs have you 
highlight the files and click a Transfer button.
 
✓ Choose the correct transfer mode. File transfers via FTP have two dif-
ferent forms: ASCII and binary. Most FTP clients are configured to auto-
detect the transfer mode. Understanding the difference as it pertains to 
this WordPress installation is important, so that you can troubleshoot 
any problems you have later:
 
• Binary transfer mode is how images (such as .jpg, .gif, .bmp, 
and .png files) are transferred via FTP.

Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
• ASCII transfer mode is for everything else (text files, PHP files, 
JavaScript, and so on).
 
 For the most part, it’s a safe bet to make sure that the transfer mode of 
your FTP client is set to autodetect. But if you experience issues with 
how those files load on your site, retransfer the files using the appropri-
ate transfer mode.
 
✓ You can choose a different folder from the root. You aren’t required to 
transfer the files to the root directory of your Web server. You can make 
the choice to run WordPress on a subdomain, or in a different folder, 
on your account. If you want your blog address to be http://your
domain.com/blog, you would transfer the WordPress files into a folder 
named /blog.
 
✓ Choose the right file permissions. You need to pay attention to file permis-
sions when you’re transferring files to your Web server. File permissions tell 
the Web server how these files can be handled on your server — whether 
they’re files that can be written to. As a general rule, PHP files need to 
have a permission (chmod) of 666, whereas file folders need a permission 
of 755. Almost all FTP clients let you check and change the permissions on 
the files, if you need to. Typically, you can find the option to change file 
permissions within the menu options of your FTP client.
 
 Some hosting providers run their PHP software in a more secure format 
called safe mode. If this is the case with your host, you need to set the 
PHP files to 644. If you’re unsure, ask your hosting provider what per-
missions you need to set for PHP files.
Last step: Running the install script
The final step in the installation procedure for WordPress is connecting the 
WordPress software you uploaded to the MySQL database. Follow these steps:
 
1. Type this URL in the address window of your browser, replacing your-
domain.com with your own domain name: 
http://yourdomain.com/wp-admin/install.php
 
 If you chose to install WordPress in a different folder from the root 
directory of your account, make sure you indicate this fact in the URL 
for the install script. If you transferred the WordPress software files to 
a folder called /blog, for example, you would point your browser to 
the following URL to run the installation: http://yourdomain.com/
blog/wp-admin/install.php.
 
 Assuming that you did everything correctly (see Table 6-1 for help with 
common installation problems), you see the message shown in Figure 6-4.

113
 Chapter 6: Setting Up Blogging Base Camp
 
Figure 6-4: 
The first 
time you 
run the 
installation 
script for 
WordPress, 
you see this 
message.
 
 
2. Click the Create a Configuration File button. 
 
 The next page that opens is a Welcome to WordPress message, which 
gives you the information you need to proceed with the installation.
 
3. Click the Let’s Go button at the bottom of that page.
 
4. Dig out the database name, username, and password that you saved 
earlier, and use that information to fill in the following fields (shown 
in Figure 6-5):
 
• Database Name: Type the database name you used when you cre-
ated the MySQL database before this installation. Because hosts 
differ in configurations, you need to enter either the database 
name or the database name with your hosting account username 
appended.
 
 If you named your database wordpress, for example, you would enter 
that in this text box. Or if your host requires you to append the data-
base name with your hosting account username, you would enter 
username_wordpress, substituting your hosting username for user-
name. My username is lisasabin, so I entered lisasabin_wordpress.

114
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
• User Name: Type the username you used when you created the 
MySQL database before this installation. Depending on what your 
host requires, you may need to append this username to your 
hosting account username.
 
• Password: Type the password you used when you set up the 
MySQL database. You don’t need to append the password to your 
hosting account username here.
 
• Database Host: Ninety-nine percent of the time, you’ll leave this 
field set to localhost. Some hosts, depending on their configura-
tions, have different hosts set for the MySQL database server. If 
localhost doesn’t work, you need to contact your hosting provider 
to find out the MySQL database host.
 
• Table Prefix: Leave this field set to wp_.
 
5. When you have all that information filled in, click the Submit button. 
 
 You see a message that says, “All right, sparky! You’ve made it through 
this part of the installation. WordPress can now communicate with your 
database. If you’re ready, time now to run the install!”
 
6. Click the Run the Install button.
 
 You see another welcome page with a message welcoming you to the 
famous five-minute WordPress installation process.
 
7. Enter or possibly change this information:
 
• Blog Title: Enter the title you want to give your blog. The title you 
enter isn’t written in stone; you can change it at a later date, if 
you like.
 
• Your E-Mail Address: Enter the e-mail address you want to use to 
be notified of administrative information about your blog. You can 
change this address at a later date, too.
 
• Allow My Blog to Appear in Search Engines Like Google and 
Technorati: By default, this check box is selected, which lets the 
search engines index the content of your blog and include your 
blog in search results. To keep your blog out of the search engines, 
deselect this check box.
 
8. Click the Install WordPress button.
 
 The WordPress installation machine works its magic and creates all 
the tables within the database that contain the default data for your 
blog. WordPress gives you the login information you need to access the 
WordPress Administration panel (see Figure 6-6). Make note of this user-
name and password before you leave this page. Scribble it down on a 
piece of paper or copy it into a text editor such as Notepad.

115
 Chapter 6: Setting Up Blogging Base Camp
 
 After you click the Install WordPress button, you’re sent an e-mail with 
the login information and login URL. This information is handy if you’re 
called away during this part of the installation process. So go ahead and 
let the dog out, answer the phone, brew a cup of coffee, or take a 
15-minute power nap. If you somehow get distracted away from this 
page, the e-mail sent to you contains the information you need to suc-
cessfully log in to your WordPress blog.
 
9. Click the Log In button to log in to WordPress.
 
 If you happen to lose this page before clicking the Log In button, you can 
always find your way to the login page by entering your domain followed 
by the call to the login file (for example, http://yourdomain.com/
wp-login.php).
 
 You know that you’re finished with the installation process when you 
see the login page, as shown in Figure 6-7. Check out Table 6-1 if you 
experience any problems during this installation process; it covers some 
of the common problems users run into.
So do tell — how much time does your watch show for the installation? 
Was it five minutes? Stop by my blog sometime (http://lisasabin-
wilson.com), and let me know whether WordPress stood up to its famous 
five-minute-installation reputation. I’m a curious sort.

The good news is — you’re done! Were you expecting a marching band? 
WordPress isn’t that fancy . . . yet. Give them time, though; if anyone can pro-
duce it, the folks at WordPress can.

Let me be the first to congratulate you on your newly installed WordPress 
blog! When you’re ready, log in and familiarize yourself with the 
Administration panel, which I describe in Chapter 7.

118
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 

Chapter 7
Understanding the WordPress.org 
Administration Panel
In This Chapter
▶ Signing in to the Administration panel
▶ Finding your way around the Dashboard
▶ Customizing the Dashboard
▶ Applying your own settings
▶ Personalizing your profile
▶ Deciding how your blog will look
W
ith WordPress.org successfully installed, you can explore your new 
blogging software. This chapter guides you through the preliminary 
setup of your new WordPress blog using the Administration panel. When you 
blog with WordPress, you spend a lot of time in the Administration panel, 
which is where you make all the exciting, behind-the-scenes stuff happen. 
In this panel, you find all the settings and options that enable you to set up 
your blog just the way you want it. (If you still need to install and configure 
WordPress, check out Chapter 6.)
Feeling comfortable with the Administration panel sets you up for successful 
entrance into the WordPress blogging world. You will tweak your WordPress 
settings several times throughout the life of your blog. In this chapter, as I go 
through the various sections, settings, options, and configurations available 
to you, understand that nothing is set in stone. You can set options today 
and change them at any time.
Logging In to the Administration Panel
I find that the direct approach (also known as jumping in) works best when 
I want to get familiar with a new software tool. To that end, just follow these 
steps to log in to WordPress and take a look at the guts of the Administration 
panel:

120
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
1. Open your Web browser, and type the WordPress login-page address 
(or URL) in the address box.
 
 The login-page address looks something like this:
http://www.yourdomain.com/wp-login.php.
 
 If you installed WordPress in its own folder, include that folder name in 
the login URL. If you installed WordPress in a folder ingeniously named 
wordpress, the login URL becomes http://www.yourdomain.com/
wordpress/wp-login.php.
 
2. Type your username in the Username text box and your password in 
the Password text box (see Figure 7-1).
 
 In case you forget your password, WordPress has you covered. Click the 
Lost Your Password? link (located near the bottom of the page), enter 
your username and e-mail address, and then click the Submit button. 
WordPress resets your password and e-mails the new password to you.
 
 After you request a password, you receive two e-mails from your 
WordPress blog. The first e-mail contains a link that you click to verify 
that you requested the password. After you verify your intentions, you 
receive an e-mail containing your new password.
 
3. Select the Remember Me check box if you want WordPress to place a 
cookie in your browser.
 
 The cookie tells WordPress to remember your login credentials the 
next time you show up. The cookie set by WordPress is harmless and 
stores your WordPress login on your computer. Because of the cookie, 
WordPress remembers you the next time you visit.
 
 Note: Before you set this option, make sure that your browser is config-
ured to allow cookies. (If you aren’t sure how to do this, check the help 
documentation of the Internet browser you’re using.)
 
4. Click the Log In button.

121
 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
After you’ve logged in to your WordPress Administration panel, you see the 
Dashboard page.
Navigating the Dashboard
You can consider the Administration panel to be a Control Panel of sorts, 
because it offers several quick links and areas that provide information about 
your blog, starting with the actual Dashboard page, shown in Figure 7-2.
You can change how the WordPress Dashboard looks, at least in terms of the 
order the modules appear on it. You can expand (open) and collapse (close) 
the individual modules by clicking your mouse anywhere within the grey 
title bar of the module. This feature is really nice because you can utilize the 
Dashboard for just those modules that you use regularly. The concept is easy: 
Keep the modules you use all the time open and close the ones that you only 
use occasionally — you can open those modules only when you really need 
them. You save space and you can customize your Dashboard to suit your own 
needs.
When you view your Dashboard for the very first time, all of the modules in 
the Dashboard appear in the expanded (open) position by default (refer to 
Figure 7-2).
 
Figure 7-2: 
The 
WordPress 
Dashboard 
page is the 
screen you 
see the first 
time you log 
in to your 
WordPress 
Admin-
istration 
panel.
 

122
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
The navigation menu in the WordPress Dashboard appears on the left side of 
your browser window. When you need to get back to the WordPress 
Dashboard, click the Dashboard link that appears at the top of the navigation 
menu of any of the pages within your WordPress Administration panel.
In the following sections, I cover the Dashboard page as it appears when you 
login to your WordPress Administration panel for the very first time; later in 
this chapter, I show you how to configure the appearance of your Dashboard 
so that it best suits how you use the available modules.
Right Now
The Right Now module in the Dashboard shows what is going on in your blog 
right now, right this very second! Figure 7-3 shows the expanded Right Now 
module in my brand-spanking-new WordPress blog.
 
Figure 7-3: 
The Right 
Now mod-
ule in the 
Dashboard, 
expanded 
to see the 
available 
features.
 
The Right Now module shows the following default information under the At 
a Glance header: 
 
✓ The number of posts you have: This number reflects the total number 
of posts you currently have in your WordPress blog; I have 1 post on 
my blog. The number is blue, which means it’s a link that you can click. 
When you do, you go to the Edit Posts page, where you can edit the 
posts on your blog. I cover editing posts in Chapter 8.
 
✓ The number of pages: This is the current number of pages on your blog, 
which changes as you add or delete pages. (Pages, in this context, refer 
to the static pages you have created in your blog.) Figure 7-3 shows that 
my blog has 1 page.
 
 Clicking this link takes you to the Edit Pages page, where you can 
view, edit, and delete your current pages. (Find the difference between 
WordPress posts and pages in Chapter 8.)

123
 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
 
✓ The number of categories: This is the current number of categories you 
have on your blog, which changes as you add and delete categories. 
Figure 7-3 shows that I have 1 category for my blog.
 
 Clicking this link takes you to the Categories Page, where you can view, 
edit, and delete your current categories; or add brand new ones. (For 
details about the management and creation of categories, see Chapter 8.)
 
✓ The number of tags: This is the current number of tags you have in 
your blog, which changes as you add and delete categories in the future. 
Figure 7-3 shows that I have 0 tags.
 
 Clicking this link takes you to the Tags page, where you can add new 
tags and view, edit, and delete your current tags. (You can find more 
information about tags in Chapter 8.)
 
✓ The number of comments: This is the total number of the comments 
that are currently on your blog. Figure 7-3 shows that I have 1 Comment, 
1 Approved, 0 Pending, and 0 marked as spam. 
 
 Clicking any of these four links takes you to the Edit Comments page, 
where you can manage the comments on your blog. I cover the manage-
ment of comments in the “Comments” section, later in this chapter.
The last section of the Dashboard’s Right Now module in the Dashboard 
shows the following information:
 
✓ Which WordPress theme you are using: Figure 7-3 shows that I’m using 
the WordPress Default theme. The theme name is a link that, when 
clicked, takes you to the Manage Themes page where you can view and 
activate themes on your blog.
 
✓ How many widgets you’ve added to your blog: This is the number of 
WordPress widgets you’re using in your blog. Figure 7-3 shows that I 
have 0 widgets. The number 0 is a link that, when clicked, takes you to 
the Widgets page, where you can change your widget options by edit-
ing them, moving them, or removing them. (I cover widgets in detail in 
Chapter 5 if you want to check that out — although that chapter is in the 
WordPress.com part of this book, the method of using sidebar widgets is 
the same for self-hosted WordPress.org blogs.)
 
✓ Change Theme: Clicking this button takes you to the Manage Themes 
page, which lists your currently active and all available themes for your 
WordPress blog. Your active theme (the theme that’s visible on your 
active blog) is shown at the top below the Current Theme header. All 
other available themes are listed below Available Themes. Click any 
theme on this page to use it on your blog.
 
✓ The version of WordPress you’re using: This is the last statement in the 
Right Now section. Figure 7-3 shows that I’m using WordPress version 2.7. 
In the future, this version announcement will change if you are using 
an older version of WordPress. When WordPress software is upgraded, 
this statement will tell you that you are using an outdated version of 
WordPress and encourage you to upgrade to the latest version.

124
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
Recent Comments
The next module is called Recent Comments — within this module, you find:
 
✓ Most recent comments published to your blog: WordPress displays a 
maximum of five comments in this area.
 
✓ The author of each comment: The name of the person who left the com-
ment appears below it. This section also displays the author’s picture 
(or avatar), if they have one.
 
✓ A link to the post the comment was left on: The post title appears to 
the right of the commenter’s name. Click the link, and you go to that 
post in the Admin panel.
 
✓ An excerpt of the comment: This is a short snippet of the comment this 
person left on your blog.
 
✓ Comment management links: When you hover over the comment with 
your mouse cursor, five links appear underneath the comment that 
give you the opportunity to manage those comments right from your 
Dashboard: Unapprove (this link appears only if you have comment 
moderation turned on. Find out more about moderating comments in 
the “Comments” section, later in this chapter), Edit, Reply, Spam, and 
Delete.
 
✓ View All button: This button invites you to see all the comments that 
have been left on your blog. Clicking the View All button takes you to the 
Edit Comments page, where you can view and edit, moderate, or delete 
any comments that have been left for your blog.
You’ll find even more information on managing your comments in the 
“Comments” section, later in this chapter.
Incoming Links
The next module visible in the Dashboard is Incoming Links. It lists all the 
blog-savvy people who wrote a blog post that links to your blog. When your 
blog is brand new, you won’t see any incoming links listed in this section. 
Don’t despair, however; as time goes on, you will see this listing of links fill 
up as more and more people discover you and your inspired writings!
In the meantime, the Incoming Links module shows “This dashboard widget 
queries Google Blog Search so that when another blog links to your site it will 
show up here. It has found no incoming links ... yet. It’s okay — there is no 
rush.” The phrase Google Blog Search is a link; when you click it, you go the 
Google Blog Search directory, which is a search engine for blogs only.

125
 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
The following steps show you what how you can edit the Incoming Links 
module:
 
1. Hover your mouse over the title of the Incoming Links module and a new 
link appears directly to the right of the Configure title. Click that link. 
 
 Now you can change the settings of the Incoming Links module (see 
Figure 7-4). 
 
2. Add a URL in the Enter the RSS Feed URL Here box.
 
 You can enter the URL of any RSS feed you want to display incoming links 
to your site. Feeds you can use include Technorati (http://technorati.
com) and Yahoo! Search (http://search.yahoo.com). You’re not 
restricted to using the Google Blog Search engine (http://blogsearch.
google.com) to provide your Incoming Links information.
 
3. Specify how many items you want to display.
 
 The default number is 5, but making a different choice from the drop-
down menu lets you display up to 20 items (incoming links).
 
4. Specify whether to display the item date.
 
 Check the Display Item Date? box if you want each incoming link to dis-
play the date the link was created. If you don’t want the date display, 
leave that box blank.
 
5. Click the Submit button to save all your preferences.
 
 Clicking Submit resets the Incoming Links module with your new set-
tings saved.

tings of the

Plugins
I cover the management and use of WordPress plugins in detail in Chapter 
10; however, for the purposes of this section, I discuss the functions of the 
Plugins module in the Dashboard so you know what to do with it now!

126
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
The Plugins module includes three titles of WordPress plugins that are 
linked to its page within the WordPress Plugin Directory. The Plugins module 
pulls information via RSS feed from the official WordPress Plugin Directory 
at http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins. This module displays a 
plugin from three different plugin categories in the official WordPress Plugin 
Directory: Most Popular, Newest Plugins and Recently Updated.
The Plugins module doesn’t have an Edit link, so you can’t customize the 
information that it displays. Use this box to discover new plugins that can 
help you do fun and exciting things with your blog.
The Plugins module does have a very exciting feature that you can use to 
install, activate, and manage plugins on your blog. Just follow these steps to 
make it happen:
 
1. Click the Install link next to the title of the plugin.
 
 The Plugin Information popup window opens (see Figure 7-5). It displays 
the various bits of information about the plugin you’ve chosen, such as 
title, description, version, author, date last updated, and the number of 
times the plugin was downloaded.
 
2. Click the Install Now button.
 
 This button is at the top right of the Plugin Information page, as seen in 
Figure 7-5. 
 
 The Plugin Information popup window closes and the Install Plugins 
page in your WordPress Administration panel opens, where you see a 
confirmation message that the plugin has been downloaded, unpacked, 
and successfully installed.
 
3. Specify whether to install the plugin or proceed to the Plugins page.
 
 Two links are shown under the confirmation message:
 
• Activate Plugin: Click this link to activate the plugin you just 
installed on your blog.
 
• Return to Plugins Page: Click this link to go to the Manage 
Plugins page.
 
 I cover the installation, installation, and activation of WordPress plugins 
in further depth in Chapter 10.
 
4. Click the Dashboard link to return to the Dashboard.
 
 The Dashboard link is located at the top of the left menu on every page 
of your WordPress Administration panel. 

127
 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
 
Figure 7-5: 
The Plugin 
Information 
page gives 
you informa-
tion on a 
plugin, and 
allows you 
to install 
it directly 
from your 
WordPress 
Dashboard.
 
QuickPress
The QuickPress module is a handy form that allows you to write, save, and 
publish a blog post right from your WordPress Dashboard. The options are 
similar to the ones I cover in the section on writing posts in Chapter 8.
Recent Drafts
If you’re using a brand new WordPress blog and this is a new installation, 
the Recent Drafts module displays the message: There are no drafts at the 
moment. That is because you have not written any drafts. As time goes on, 
however, and you have written a few posts in your blog, you may save some 
of those posts as Drafts — to be edited and published at a later date. Those 
drafts show up in the Recent Drafts module.
WordPress displays up to five drafts and displays the title of the post, the 
date it was last saved, and a short excerpt. A View All link also displays; click 
that link to go the Manage Posts page where you can view, edit, and manage 
your blog posts. Check out Chapter 8 for more information.

128
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
WordPress Development Blog
When you first install WordPress, the WordPress Development Blog module 
is by default populated with the two most recent updates from the official 
WordPress development blog at http://wordpress.org/development. 
You see the title of the last post, the date it was published, and a short 
excerpt of the post. Click a title, and you go directly to that post on the 
WordPress Development Blog.
 
Following the updates of the WordPress Development Blog is very useful, and 
I highly recommend it. Why? Every single time you log in to your WordPress 
Dashboard, a glance at this section informs you about any news, updates, or 
alerts from the makers of WordPress. You can find out about any new versions 
of the software, security patches, or other important news regarding the soft-
ware you are using to power your blog.
Although I recommend that you keep the WordPress Development Blog 
updates in this section, the WordPress platform lets you change this box to 
display posts from another blog of your choosing. You can accomplish this 
change by following these steps:
 
1. Hover your mouse over the WordPress Development module 
title. Click the Configure link shown to the right of the WordPress 
Development Blog title.
 
 The module changes to display several options to change the informa-
tion contained in the box (see Figure 7-6).
 
2. Type your preferred RSS feed in the Enter the RSS feed URL Here box.
 
3. Type your preferred title in the Give the Feed a Title (Optional) box.
 
4. Specify the number of items you want to display.
 
 The default number of items is 2, but you can display up to 20 by making 
a different choice from the drop-down menu.

 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
 
5. Specify whether you want to display the item’s content.
 
 Item content refers to the text content of the post. If you don’t check the 
Display Item Content? box, WordPress doesn’t display an excerpt of the 
post — only the post title.
 
6. Specify whether you want to display the name of the person who 
wrote the post.
 
 Leave the Display Item Author If Available? box unchecked if you don’t 
want the author’s name displayed.
 
7. Specify whether you want to display the date.
 
 Leave the Display Item Date? box unchecked if you don’t want the date 
displayed.
 
8. Click the Submit button to save your changes.
 
 The Dashboard page refreshes with your new changes. Click the title of 
the box to collapse it.
 
If you change your mind, click the Cancel link shown to the right of the 
WordPress Development Blog title. Clicking Cancel discards any changes you 
made and keeps the original settings intact.
The title of the WordPress Development Blog module changes to the title you 
chose in Step 3. Figure 7-7 shows that I changed the title to Lisa’s Blog.

you set.
 
Other WordPress News
The Other WordPress News module of the Dashboard pulls in posts from a 
site called WordPress Planet (http://planet.wordpress.org). By keep-
ing the default setting in this area the same, you stay in touch with several 
posts made by folks who are involved in WordPress development, design, 
and troubleshooting. You can find lots of interesting and useful tidbits if you 

130
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
keep this area intact. Quite often, I find great information about new plugins 
or themes, problem areas and support, troubleshooting, and new ideas, so I 
tend to stick with the default setting.
WordPress is all about user experience, however, so you can change the 
options to specify what displays in this area. You can change the items in 
this module the same way that you change the options for the WordPress 
Development Blog module (see the preceding section).
Arranging the Dashboard to Your Tastes
You have the ability to arrange the order of the modules in your Dashboard 
to suit your tastes. WordPress places a great deal of emphasis on user experi-
ence and a big part of that effort results in your ability to create a Dashboard 
that you find most useful. Changing the modules that are displayed, and the 
order they are displayed in, is very easy.
In the following steps, I show you how to move the Right Now module so that 
it displays on the right side of your Dashboard page:
 
1. Hover your mouse over the title bar of the Right Now module.
 
 When hovering over the box title, your mouse cursor changes to the 
Move cursor (a cross with arrows on a PC or the hand cursor on a Mac).
 
2. Click and hold your mouse button and drag the Right Now module to 
the right side of the screen.
 
 As you drag the box, a light gray box with a dotted border appears on 
the right side of your screen. That gray box is a guide that shows you 
where you should drop the module. See Figure 7-8.
 
3. Release the mouse button when you have the Right Now module in 
place.
 
 The Right Now module is now positioned on the right side of your 
Dashboard page.
 
 The other modules on the left side of the Dashboard have now shifted 
down and the Recent Comments Module is the first module shown at the 
top of the left side on the Dashboard page.
 
4. (Optional) Click once on the title bar of the Right Now module.
 
 The module collapses. Click the title bar again and the module expands. 
You can keep that module opened or closed based on your own preference. 

131
 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
 
Figure 7-8: 
A light gray 
box appears 
as a guide 
when drag-
ging and 
dropping 
modules 
in the 
WordPress 
Dashboard.
 
Repeat these steps with each module you see on the Dashboard by dragging 
and dropping them so they appear in the order you prefer.
 
When you navigate away from the Dashboard, WordPress remembers the 
changes you’ve made. When you return, you still see your customized 
Dashboard and you don’t need to redo these changes in the future.
If you find that your Dashboard contains a few modules you just never use, 
you can completely get rid of them altogether by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Screen Options button at the top of the Dashboard.
 
 The Screen Options menu opens, displaying the title of each module 
with check boxes to the left of each title.
 
2. De-select the module you want to hide on your Dashboard.
 
 The check mark is removed from the box and the module disappears 
from your Dashboard. Figure 7-9 shows my customized Dashboard.
 
If you miss a module you’ve hidden, you can simply enable that module by 
selecting the module from the Screen Options menu.

Setting Options in the 
Administration Panel
The navigation menu is located on the left side of every page within the 
WordPress Administration panel. You’ll find it there everywhere you go — 
like a loyal friend, it’s always there for you when you need it!
The navigation menu is divided into ten different menus. Hover your 
mouse over a menu and a down arrow appears to the right; click the down 
arrow to reveal the submenu. The submenus take you to areas within your 
Administration panel that allow you to perform tasks such as publishing a 
new blog post, adding a new link, or managing your comments.
 
When you expand a menu in the navigation menu, WordPress remembers 
and keeps that menu expanded as you navigate through different pages in the 
Administration panel. Likewise, if you collapse the menu, WordPress remem-
bers that you’ve closed that menu, and the menu stays closed as you browse 
through your WordPress Administration panel.
The settings that allow you to personalize your blog are the first ones that I 
cover in the next part of this chapter. Some of the menu items, like creating 

133
 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
and publishing new posts, are covered in detail other chapters, but they’re 
well worth a mention here as well so that you know what you’re looking at. 
(Each section contains a cross-reference telling you where you can find more 
in-depth information on that topic in this book.)
Configuring the Settings
At the very bottom of the navigation menu is the Settings menu. Click the 
Settings link and a submenu drops down that contain the following links, 
which I discuss in the sections that follow: 
 
✓ General 
 
✓ Writing 
 
✓ Reading
 
✓ Discussion
 
✓ Media
 
✓ Privacy
 
✓ Permalinks
 
✓ Miscellaneous
General
After you install the WordPress software and log in, you can put a personal 
stamp on your blog by giving it a title and description, setting your contact 
e-mail address, and identifying yourself as the author of the blog. You take 
care of these and other settings on the General Settings page.
To begin personalizing your blog, start with your general settings by follow-
ing these steps:
 
1. Click the General link in the Settings menu.
 
 The General Settings page appears (see Figure 7-10).
 
2. Enter the name of your blog in the Blog Title text box.
 
 The title you enter here is the one that you’ve given your blog to identify 
it as your own. In Figure 7-10, I gave my new blog the title WordPress For 
Dummies, which appears on the blog as well as in the title bar of the 
viewer’s Web browser. But I chose to title my personal blog Lisa Sabin-
Wilson to identify it as mine. Mine! MINE! And with it, I shall rule the 
world! Ahem . . . moving on!

134
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
Figure 7-10: 
Personalize 
the settings 
of your 
WordPress 
blog on the 
General 
Settings 
page.
 
 
 Give your blog an interesting and identifiable name. You could use 
Fried Green Tomatoes, for example, if you’re blogging about the topic, 
the book or the movie, or even anything remotely related to the lovely 
Southern dish.
 
3. In the Tagline text box, enter a five- to ten-word phrase that describes 
your blog.
 
 Figure 7-10 shows that my tagline is by Lisa Sabin-Wilson. So my blog 
displays my blog title followed by the tagline: WordPress For Dummies by 
Lisa Sabin-Wilson.
 
 The general Internet-surfing public can view your blog title and tagline, 
which various search engines (such as Google, Yahoo!, and MSN) grab for 
indexing, so choose your words with this fact in mind. (You can find more 
information about search engine optimization, or SEO, in Chapter 14.)
 
4. In the WordPress Address (URL) text box, enter the location where 
you installed your WordPress blog software.
 
 Be sure to include the http:// portion of the URL and the entire path to 
your WordPress installation — for example, http://yourdomain.com. 
If you installed WordPress in a folder in your directory — in a folder called 

135
 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
wordpress, for example — you need to make sure to include it here. If 
I had installed WordPress in a folder called wordpress, the WordPress 
address would be http://yourdomain.com/wordpress.
 
5. In the Blog Address (URL) text box, enter the Web address where 
people can find your blog by using their Web browsers.
 
 Typically, what you enter here is the same as your domain name 
(http://yourdomain.com). If you install WordPress in a subdirectory 
of your site, the WordPress installation URL is different from the blog 
URL. If you install WordPress at http://yourdomain.com/word
press/ (WordPress URL), you need to tell WordPress that you want the 
blog to appear at http://yourdomain.com (the blog URL).
 
6. Enter your e-mail address in the E-Mail Address text box.
 
 WordPress sends messages about the details of your blog to this 
e-mail address. When a new user registers for your blog, for example, 
WordPress sends you an e-mail alert.
 
7. Select a Membership option.
 
 Select the Anyone Can Register box if you want to keep registration 
on your blog open to anyone who wants to. Keep the box unchecked if 
you’d rather not have open registration on your blog. 
 
8. From the New User Default Role drop-down menu, choose the role 
that you want new users to have when they register for user accounts 
in your blog.
 
 You need to understand the differences among the user roles, because each 
user role is assigned a different level of access to your blog, as follows:
 
• Subscriber: Subscriber is the default role. It’s a good idea to main-
tain this role as the one assigned to new users, particularly if you 
don’t know who is registering. Subscribers are given access to 
the Dashboard page, and they can view and change the options 
in their profiles on the Your Profile and Personal Options page. 
(They don’t have access to your account settings, however — 
only to their own). Each user can change his username, e-mail 
address, password, bio, and other descriptors in his user profile. 
Subscribers’ profile information is stored in the WordPress data-
base, and your blog remembers them each time they visit, so they 
don’t have to complete the profile information each time they 
leave comments on your blog.
 
• Contributor: In addition to the access Subscribers have, 
Contributors can upload files and write, edit, and manage their 
own posts. Contributors can write posts, but they can’t publish the 
posts; the administrator reviews all Contributor posts and decides 
whether to publish them. This setting is a nice way to moderate 
content written by new authors.

136
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
• Author: In addition to the access Contributors have, Authors can 
publish and edit their own posts.
 
• Editor: In addition to the access Authors have, Editors can moder-
ate comments, manage categories, manage links, edit pages, and 
edit other Authors’ posts.
 
• Administrator: Administrators can edit all the options and settings 
in the WordPress blog.
 
9. In the Timezone section, choose your UTC time from the drop-
down menu.
 
 This setting refers to the number of hours that your local time differs 
from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). This setting ensures that all 
your blog posts and comments left on your blog are time-stamped with 
the correct time. If you’re lucky enough, like me, to live on the frozen 
tundra of Wisconsin, which is in the Central time zone (CST), you would 
choose –6 from the drop-down menu because that time zone is 6 hours 
off UTC.
 
 If you’re unsure what your UTC time is, you can find it at the Greenwich 
Mean Time (http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com) Web site. GMT 
is essentially the same thing as UTC.
 
10. In the Date Format text box, enter the format in which you want the 
date to be displayed in your blog.
 
 This setting determines the style of the date display. The default format 
is already selected, and displayed for you: F j, Y (F = the full month 
name; j = the two-digit day; Y = the four-digit year), which gives you the 
date output. This default date format displays the date like this: January 
1, 2008. 
 
 Select a different format by clicking the circle to the left of the option. 
You can also customize the date display by selecting the Custom option 
and entering your preferred format in the text box provided. If you’re 
feeling adventurous, you can found out how to customize the date 
format here: http://codex.wordpress.org/Formatting_Date_
and_Time.
 
11. In the Time Format text box, enter the format in which you want the 
time to be displayed in your blog.
 
 This setting is the style of the time display. The default format is already 
inserted for you: g:i a (g = the two-digit hour; i = the two-digit minute; a = 
lowercase ante meridiem and post meridiem, or a.m. or p.m.), which 
gives you the output of 12:00 a.m. 
 
 Select a different format by clicking the circle to the left of the option. You 
can also customize the date display by selecting the Custom option and 
entering your preferred format in the text box provided; find out how at 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Formatting_Date_and_Time.

137
 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
 
 The Timezone option does not update automatically for daylight saving 
time (DST). If you live in an area of the world that practices DST, you 
have to update the Timezone option manually when it occurs.
 
 You can format the time and date in several ways. Go to http://us3.
php.net/date to find potential formats at the PHP Web site.
 
12. From the drop-down menu, choose the day the week starts in your 
calendar.
 
 The display of the calendar in the sidebar of your blog is optional. If you 
choose to display the calendar, you can select the day of the week you 
want your calendar to start with.
 
Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of any page where you set new 
options. If you don’t click Save Changes, your settings aren’t saved, and 
WordPress reverts to the preceding options. Each time you click the Save 
Changes button, WordPress reloads the current page, displaying the new 
options that you just set.
Writing 
Click the Writing link in the Settings menu; the Writing Settings page opens 
(see Figure 7-11).

The third link in the Settings menu is Reading (see Figure 7-12).
You can set the following options in the Reading Settings page:
 
✓ Front Page Displays: Choose what you want to display on the front page 
of your blog: your latest posts or a static page. You can find detailed 
information about using a static page for your front page in Chapter 14.
 
✓ Blog Pages Show at Most: Enter the maximum number of posts you 
want to display on each blog page.
 
✓ Syndication Feeds Show the Most Recent: In the Posts box, enter the 
maximum number of posts you want to show in your RSS feed at any time.
 
✓ For Each Article in a Feed, Show: Select either Full Text or Summary. 
Full Text publishes the entire post to your RSS feed, whereas Summary 
publishes only an excerpt. (Check out Chapter 8 for more information on 
WordPress RSS feeds.)
 
✓ Encoding for Pages and Feeds: UTF-8 is the default, and recommended, 
character encoding for your blog. Character encoding is code that han-
dles the storage and transmission of the text from your blog through 
the Internet connection. Your safest bet is to leave the default setting in 
place, because UTF-8 is the most commonly accepted character encod-
ing and supports a wide range of languages.

Discussion
Discussion is the fourth link in the Settings menu; click it to open the 
Discussion Settings page (see Figure 7-13). The sections on this tab let you 
set options for handling comments and publishing of posts to your blog.
The following sections cover the options available to you in the Discussion 
Settings page, which deals mainly with how comments and trackbacks are 
handled in your blog.
Default Article Settings
In the Default Article Settings sections, you can tell WordPress how to handle 
post notifications. Here are your options:

141
 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
 
✓ Attempt to Notify Any Blogs Linked to from the Article (Slows Down 
Posting): Check this box, and your blog sends a notification (or ping) to 
any site you have linked to in your blog posts. This notification is also 
commonly referred to as a trackback (I discuss trackbacks in Chapter 2). 
Clear this box if you don’t want these notifications to be sent.
 
✓ Allow Link Notifications from Other Blogs (Pingbacks and 
Trackbacks): By default, this box is checked, and your blog is open to 
be notified via a ping or trackback from another blog that has linked to 
yours. Any trackbacks or pings sent to your blog are listed on your site 
in the comments section of the blog post. If you clear this box, your blog 
won’t accept pingbacks or trackbacks from other blogs.
 
✓ Allow People to Post Comments on the Article: By default, this box 
is checked, and people can leave comments on your blog posts. If you 
clear this box, no one can leave comments on your blog.
 
Figure 7-13: 
The 
Discussion 
Settings 
page.
 

142
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
Other Comment Settings
The Other Comment Settings tell WordPress how to handle comments:
 
✓ Comment Author Must Fill Out Their Name and E-Mail: Enabled by 
default, this option requires all commenters on your blog to fill in the 
Name and E-Mail field when leaving a comment. This option is very help-
ful in combating comment spam. (See Chapters 2 and 10 for information 
on comment spam.) Clear this check box to disable this option.
 
✓ Users Must Be Registered and Logged in to Comment: Not enabled by 
default, this option allows you to accept comments on your blog from 
only those people who have registered and are currently logged in as a 
user on your blog. If the user is not logged in, they see a message that 
says: You must be logged in in order to leave a comment.
 
✓ Automatically Close Comments on Articles Older Than X Days: Check 
the box next to this option to tell WordPress you would like comments 
on older articles to be automatically closed. Fill in the text box provided 
with the number of days you would like to wait before WordPress closes 
comments on older articles.
 
 This is a very effective anti-spam technique that many bloggers use to 
keep the comment and trackback spam on their blog down.
 
✓ Enable Threaded (Nested) Comments X Levels Deep: The drop-down 
menu allows you to choose the level of threaded comments you’d like 
to have on your blog. The default is 1; you can choose up to 10 levels. 
Instead of all comments being displayed on your blog in chronological 
order (as it is by default), nesting them allows you and your readers to 
reply to comments within the comment itself. 
 
✓ Break Comments into Pages with X Comments Per Page: Fill in the text 
box with a number of comments you want to display on one page. This 
is very helpful for blogs that receive a large number of comments. It 
provides you with the ability to break the long string of comments into 
several pages, which makes it easier to read and helps speed up the load 
time of your site, because the page isn’t loading such a large number of 
comments at once.
 
✓ Comments Should Be Displayed with the Older/Newer comments 
at the Top of Each Page: Use the drop-down menu to select Older or 
Newer. Selecting Older displays the comments on your blog in the order 
of oldest to newest. Selecting Newer does the opposite: displays the 
comments on your blog in the order of newest to oldest.
E-Mail Me Whenever
The two options in the E-Mail Me Whenever section are enabled by default:
 
✓ Anyone Posts a Comment: This option lets you receive an e-mail notifi-
cation whenever anyone leaves a comment on your blog. Clear the box if 
you don’t want to be notified by e-mail about every new comment.

143
 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
 
✓ A Comment Is Held for Moderation: This option lets you receive an 
e-mail notification whenever a comment is awaiting your approval in the 
comment moderation queue. (See Chapter 8 for more information about 
the comment moderation queue.) You need to deselect this option if you 
don’t want this notification.
Before a Comment Appears
The two options in the Before a Comment Appears section tell WordPress how 
you want WordPress to handle comments before they appear in your blog:
 
✓ An Administrator Must Always Approve the Comment: Disabled by 
default, this option keeps every single comment left on your blog in the 
moderation queue until you, the administrator, log in and approve it. 
Check this box to enable this option.
 
✓ Comment Author Must Have a Previously Approved Comment: 
Enabled by default, this option requires comments posted by all first-
time commenters to be sent to the comment moderation queue for 
approval by the administrator of the blog. After comment authors 
have been approved for the first time, they remain approved for every 
comment thereafter. WordPress stores their e-mail addresses in the 
database, and any future comments that match any stored e-mails 
are approved automatically. This feature is another measure that 
WordPress has built in to combat comment spam.
Comment Moderation
In the Comment Moderation section, you can set options to specify what 
types of comments are held in the moderation queue to await your approval.
To prevent spammers from spamming your blog with a ton of links check the 
Hold a Comment in the Queue If It Contains X or More Links box. The default 
number of links allowed is 2. Give that setting a try, and if you find that you’re 
getting lots of spam comments with multiple links, you may want to revisit 
this page and increase that number. Any comment with a higher number of 
links goes to the comment moderation area for approval.
The large text box in the Comment Moderation section lets you type key-
words, URLs, e-mail addresses, and IP addresses in comments that you want 
to be held in the moderation queue for your approval.
Comment Blacklist
In this section, type a list of words, URLs, e-mail addresses, and/or IP 
addresses that you want to flat-out ban from your blog. Items placed here 
don’t even make it into your comment moderation queue; the WordPress 
system filters them as spam. Let me just say that the words I have placed in 
my blacklist are not family-friendly and have no place in a nice book like this.

144
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
Avatars
The final section of the Discussion Settings page is Avatars. (See the nearby 
sidebar “What are avatars, and how do they relate to WordPress?” for infor-
mation about avatars.) In this section, you can select different settings for the 
use and display of avatars on your site:
 
1. In the Avatar Display section, decide how to display avatars on 
your site.
 
• Don’t Show Avatars: Choose this option, and your blog won’t 
display avatars.
 
• Show Avatars: Choose this option to have your blog display avatars. 
 
2. In the Maximum Rating section, set the rating for the avatars that do 
display on your site.
 
 This feature works much like the movie rating system you’re used to. 
You can select G, PG, R, and X ratings for the avatars that display on 
your site. If your site is family-friendly, you probably don’t want it to 
display R- or X-rated avatars.
 
3. Choose a default avatar in the Default Avatar section (see Figure 7-14):
 
• Mystery Man
 
• Blank
 
• Gravatar Logo
 
• Identicon (Generated)
 
• Wavatar (Generated)
 
• MonsterID (Generated)
 
4. Click the Save Changes button.

What are avatars, and how do they 
relate to WordPress?
An avatar is an online graphical representation of 
an individual. It’s a small graphic icon that people 
use to visually represent themselves on the 
Web in areas they participate in conversations 
such as discussion forums and blog comments. 
Gravatars are globally recognized avatars; it’s 
an avatar that you can take with you wherever 
you go. It appears alongside blog comments, blog 
posts, and discussion forums as long as the site 
you are interacting with is Gravatar-enabled. In 
October 2007, Automattic, the core group behind 
the WordPress platform, purchased the Gravatar 
service and integrated it into WordPress so 
that all could enjoy and benefit from the ser-
vice. Gravatars are not automatic; you need 
to sign up for an account with Gravatar so that 
you can assign an avatar to you, via your e-mail 
address. Find out more about Gravatar by visiting 
http://gravatar.com.

To enable the display of avatars in comments on your blog, the Comments 
Template (comments.php) in your active theme has to contain the code to 
display them. Hop on over to Chapter 12 to find out how to do that.
 
Click the Save Changes button after you’ve set all your options on the

Media
The next link in the Settings menu is Media; click the Media link and the 
Media Settings page opens (see Figure 7-17.)
On the Media Settings page, you can configure the options for how the dis-
play of your media (images, documents, video, and audio) files are displayed 
on your blog.

147
 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
 
Figure 7-17: 
The Media 
Settings 
page.
 
The first one is easy! For the Default Media Links settings, you have three 
options on how you want your media files linked (where should a link take 
your visitors?) when you insert one into the body of your blog post:
 
✓ None: Select this option if you don’t want your media files to be linked 
to anything.
 
✓ Post URL: Select this option to link the media file to the permalink URL 
of the post the file appears in.
 
✓ File: Select this option to link the media file to the actual file. When a 
reader clicks the media file, the file opens in a new browser window; 
whether it is a Microsoft Word document or a photograph, the actual file 
opens when clicked.
The next set of options on the Media Settings page deals with images. 
WordPress automatically resizes your images for you in three different sizes. 
The dimensions are referenced in pixels by width, then height. (For example: 
50 x 50 means 50 pixels in width by 50 pixels in height.)

148

✓ Thumbnail Size: The default is 150 x 150; enter the width and height 
of your choice. Select the Crop Thumbnail to Exact Dimensions box to 
resize the thumbnail exactly to the width and height you specified. Clear 
this box and WordPress resizes the image proportionally.
 
✓ Medium Size: The default is 300 x 300; enter the width and height num-
bers of your choice.
 
✓ Large Size: The default is 1024 x 1024; enter the width and height num-
bers of your choice.
 
✓ Default Image Size: Select Auto, Thumbnail, Medium, or Large to tell 
WordPress the default image size you want to use in your posts. You can 
override this default choice on a per post basis if you need to.
 
✓ Default Image Alignment: Select None, Left, Center, or Right to tell 
WordPress the default alignment you want to use for the images in your 
post. You can override this default choice on a per post basis.
Be sure to click the Save Changes button to save your configurations!
In Chapter 9, I go into much greater detail on how to insert images in your 
WordPress posts and pages; 
Privacy
The next Settings menu option is Privacy; click it to display the Privacy 
Settings page (see Figure 7-18).
This page contains only two options, both of which concern visibility on 
your blog:
 
✓ I Would Like My Blog to Be Visible to Everyone, Including Search 
Engines (Like Google, Sphere, Technorati) and Archivers. This option 
is the default setting and means that you are freely allowing search 
engines to visit your blog and to list you in their search results, and let-
ting your site be indexed in blog archive services such as Technorati.
 
✓ I Would Like to Block Search Engines, but Allow Normal Visitors. If 
you are one of those rare bloggers who doesn’t want that type of expo-
sure for your blog, but you do want to let normal visitors (read: no 
search engines) see your blog, select this option.
 
Be sure to click the Save Changes button after you set all your options on the 
Privacy Settings page to make the changes take effect.

Permalinks
The next link on the Settings menu is Permalinks. Clicking this link loads the 
Permalink Settings page (see Figure 7-19).
Each of the posts you create on your blog has a unique URL called a per-
malink, which is permanent link (URL) for all your blog posts, pages, and 
archives. I cover permalinks extensively in Chapter 8 by explaining what they 
are, how you can use them, and how you set the options in this page.
Miscellaneous
The final link on the Settings menu is Miscellaneous; click it to display the 
Miscellaneous Settings page (see Figure 7-20).

 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
You can change the following settings on this page:
 
✓ Store Uploads in This Folder: Type the server path to the folder on your 
Web server where you want your file uploads to be stored. The default is 
wp-content/uploads. You can specify any folder you want, however; 
just be sure that the folder you specify has permissions (chmod) set to 
755 so that it is writeable. (See Chapter 6 for more information on set-
ting file permissions.) 
 
✓ Full URL Path to Files (optional): You can also type the full URL path to 
the uploads folder as an optional setting. (The full URL path would be 
something like http://yourdomain.com/wp-content/uploads.)
 
✓ Organize My Files into Month and Year-Based Folders: Select this 
box to have WordPress organize your uploaded files in folders by 
month and by year. Files you upload in January 2009, for example, 
would be in the following folder: /wp-content/uploads/2009/01/. 
Likewise, files you upload in February 2009 would be in /wp-content/
uploads/2009/02/.
 
 This box is deselected by default; leave it that way if you do not want 
WordPress to organize your files in month and year-based folders.
 
✓ Track Links’ Update Times: Check this box to have WordPress track 
the update times on links that you have listed in your link lists. For this 
feature to work, the blogs you have listed need to ping (or notify) an 
update service such as blogrolling.com. WordPress can be configured to 
display a special notation, such as an asterisk, for updated links in your 
blogroll.
 
✓ Use Legacy my-hacks.php File Support: This feature, for small hacks, is 
rarely used by anyone other than true WordPress code jockeys. If you 
don’t know whether you are using the my-hacks.php file, you probably 
aren’t and would be safer leaving it alone.
Click the Save Changes button to save your configured options.
Creating Your Personal Profile
The next place to visit to really personalize your blog is your profile page in 
your WordPress Administration panel.
To access your profile page, click the down arrow to the right of the Users 
menu; then click the Your Profile submenu link; you’re taken to the Profile 
page (see Figure 7-21).

152
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
Figure 7-21: 
Establish 
your profile 
details here.
 
Here are the settings on this page:
 
✓ Personal Options: The Personal Options section is where you can set 
two preferences for your blog:
 
• Visual Editor: Check this box to indicate that you want to use the 
Visual Editor when writing your posts. The Visual Editor refers to 
the formatting options you find in the Write Post page (discussed 
in detail in Chapter 8). By default, the box is checked, which means 
that the Visual Editor is on. To turn it off, clear the box.
 
• Admin Color Scheme: These options set the colors in your 
Administration panel. The default is the Gray color scheme. If you 
have been using WordPress since before March 2007, the Blue 
color scheme will be familiar to you as the colors used in previous 
versions of the Administration panel.
 
• Keyboard Shortcuts: This enables you to use keyboard shortcuts for 
comment moderation. To learn more about keyboard shortcuts, click 
the More Information link; you’re taken to the Keyboard Shortcuts 
page (http://codex.wordpress.org/Keyboard_Shortcuts) 
in the WordPress Codex with some helpful information.

153
 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
 
✓ Name: This section is where you can input personal information such 
as your first name, last name, and nickname, and specify how you 
want your name to be displayed publicly. Fill in the text boxes with the 
requested information.
 
✓ Contact Info: In this section, you provide your e-mail address and 
other contact information to tell your visitors who you are and where 
they may contact you. Aside from e-mail, you can provide your ID for 
various Internet chat programs such as Yahoo! IM, AIM (AOL Instant 
Messenger), and Jabber/Google Talk.
 
 Note that your e-mail address is the only required entry here. This 
address is the one WordPress uses to notify you when you have new 
comments or new user registrations on your blog. Make sure to use a 
real e-mail address so that you get these notifications.
 
✓ About Yourself: This section is where you can provide a little bio for 
yourself and change the password for your blog. 
 
 When your profile is published to your Web site, it not only can be 
viewed by anyone — it also gets picked up by search engines like Google 
and Yahoo! Always be careful with the information in your profile. Think 
hard about the information you want to share with the rest of the world!
 
• Biographical Info: Type a short bio in the Biographical Info text 
box. This information can be shown publicly if you are using a 
theme that displays your bio, so be creative!
 
• New Password: When you want to change the password for your 
blog, type your new password in the first text box in the New 
Password section. To confirm your new password, type it again in 
the second text box.
 
 Directly below the two text boxes is a little password helper. WordPress 
helps you create a secure password by alerting you if the password 
you’ve chosen is too short or not secure enough by telling you that it 
is Bad. When creating a new password, use a combination of letters, 
numbers, and symbols to make it hard for anyone to guess (for example, 
aty89!#4j). When you create a password that WordPress thinks is a good 
one, it lets you know by saying that the password is Strong.
 
 Change your password frequently. I can’t recommend this practice 
strongly enough. Some people on the Internet make it their business to 
attempt to hijack blogs for their own malicious purposes. If you change 
your password monthly, you lower your risk by keeping hackers guessing.
When you finish setting all the options on the Profile page, don’t forget to 
click the Update Profile button to save your changes.

Setting Your Blog’s Format
In addition to setting your personal settings in the Administration panel, 
you can manage the day-to-day maintenance of your blog. This next section 
takes you through the links to these sections in the navigation menu, directly 
underneath the Dashboard link.
Posts
Click the down arrow to the right of the Pages menu and a submenu drops 
down with four links: Edit, Add New, Tags, and Categories. Each link gives 
you the tools you need to publish content to your blog:
 
✓ Edit: This link opens the Edit Posts page where you see a listing of all 
the saved posts you’ve written on your blog. On this page, you can 
search for posts by date, category, or keyword. You can view all posts, 
only posts that have been published, or just those posts that have been 
saved, but not yet published (drafts). You can also edit and delete posts 
from this page. Check out Chapter 8 for more information on editing 
posts on your blog.
 
✓ Add New: This link opens the Add New Post page, which is where you 
compose your blog posts, set the options for each post (such as assign-
ing a post to a category, making it a private or public post), and publish 
the post to your blog. You can find more information on posts, post 
options, and publishing in Chapter 8.
 
 You can also get to the Add New Post page by clicking the Posts menu.
 
✓ Tags: This link opens the Tags page in your WordPress Administration 
panel where you can view, add, edit, and delete tags on your blog. 
Chapter 8 provides you with more information about what tags are and 
why you use them on your blog.
 
✓ Categories: This link opens the Categories page where you can view, 
edit, add, and delete categories on your blog. Find more information on 
categories in Chapter 8.
Media
Click the Media menu to expand the submenu of links for this section:
 
✓ Library: This link opens the Media Library page. On this page, you view, 
search, and manage all the media files you’ve ever uploaded to your 
WordPress blog.

155
 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
 
✓ Add New: This link opens the Upload New Media page where you can 
use the built-in uploader to transfer media files from your computer 
to the media directory in WordPress. Chapter 9 takes you through 
the details of how to upload images, videos, audio, and other media 
files (such as Microsoft Word or PowerPoint documents) using the 
WordPress upload feature.
 
 You can also get to the Upload New Media page by clicking the 
Media menu.
Links
The next menu header in the navigation menu is Links. Expand the Links sub-
menu by clicking the down arrow to the right of the Links menu:
 
✓ Edit: This link opens the Edit Links page, where you can view, search, 
edit, and delete existing links in your WordPress blog. Chapter 8 gives 
you detailed information about links, link lists, and blogrolls.
 
✓ Add New: This link opens the Add New Link page, where you can add 
new links to your link lists. (You can find more information about creat-
ing and managing link lists in Chapter 8.)
 
 You can also get to the Add New Link page by clicking the Links menu.
 
✓ Link Categories: This link opens the Link Categories page where you can 
add new, view, edit, and delete existing link categories (see Chapter 8).
Pages
People use this feature to create pages on their sites such as an About Me or 
Contact Me page. Flip to Chapter 8 for more information on pages. Click the 
Pages menu to reveal the submenu links:
 
✓ Edit: This link opens the Edit Pages page where you have the ability to 
search, view, edit, and delete pages in your WordPress blog,
 
✓ Add New: This link opens the Add New Page page where you can com-
pose, save, and publish a new page on your blog. Table 7-2 describes the 
difference between a post and a page — it’s subtle, but posts and pages 
are very different from one another!
 
 You can also get to the Add New Page page by clicking the Pages menu.

✓ All: This shows all comments that currently exist on your blog. This 
includes approved, pending, and spam comments.
 
✓ Awaiting Moderation: This shows comments that are not yet approved 
by you but are pending in the moderation queue.
 
✓ Approved: This shows all comments that have been previously 
approved by you.
 
✓ Spam: This shows all of the comments that are marked as spam.
 
You can also get to the Edit Comments page by clicking the Comments menu. 
You can find information in Chapter 2 about the purpose of comments. In 
Chapter 8, I give you details on how to use the Manage Comments section of 
your WordPress Administration panel.
Appearance
When you click the Appearance menu in the navigation menu, a submenu 
drops down with the following links:
 
✓ Themes: Click this link to open the Manage Themes page where you 
can manage the themes available on your blog. Check out Chapter 11 to 
learn about using themes on your WordPress blog, and how to manage 
those themes on this page.
 
 You can also navigate to this page by clicking the Themes menu.

157
 Chapter 7: Understanding the WordPress.org Administration Panel
 
✓ Widgets: This link opens the Widgets page where you can add, delete, 
edit, and manage the widgets you use on your blog.
 
✓ Editor: This link opens the Theme Editor page where you can edit your 
theme templates. Chapters 11, 12, and 13 have extensive information on 
themes and templates.
 
✓ Header Image and Color: This link opens the Customize Header page; 
however this menu item and page exist only if you have the WordPress 
Default theme activated. The Default theme is activated on all new 
WordPress blogs, which is why I’ve included this menu item in this list. 
Not all WordPress themes use the Customize Header feature, so you 
don’t see this menu item if your theme doesn’t take advantage of that 
feature.
Chapter 11 gives you a great deal of information about how to use WordPress 
themes (including where to find, install, and activate them in your WordPress 
blog), as well as detailed information on using WordPress widgets to display 
the content you want.
Part V provides information about WordPress themes and templates. You 
can dig deep into WordPress template tags and tweak an existing WordPress 
theme by using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to customize your theme a bit 
more to your liking.
Plugins
The next menu in the navigation menu is Plugins. Click the Plugins menu to 
expand the submenu of links:
 
✓ Installed: Click this link and open the Manage Plugins page where you 
can view all the plugins currently installed on your blog. On this page, 
you also have the ability to activate, deactivate, and delete plugins on 
your blog (see Chapter 10). If you click the Plugins menu, you also go to 
the Manage Plugins page.
 
✓ Add New: This link opens the Install Plugins page where can search 
for plugins from the official WordPress Plugin Directory by keyword, 
author, or tag. You can also install plugins directly to your blog from 
the Plugin Directory — you find out all about this exciting feature in 
Chapter 10!
 
✓ Editor: This link opens the Edit Plugins page where you can edit the 
plugin files in a text editor. I very strongly advise against editing plugin 
files unless you know what you are doing (read: you are familiar with 
PHP and WordPress functions). Head over to Chapter 10 to read more 
information on editing plugin files.

158
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
Users
The Users menu has two links:
 
✓ Authors & Users: Click this link to go to the Users page where you can 
view, edit, delete, and add new users to your WordPress blog. Each user 
has a unique login name and password as well as having an e-mail address 
assigned to their account. You can view and edit their information on the 
Users page. You can also add new users to your blog as well. Turn to the 
earlier section “Configuring the Settings” for more info about user roles.
 
✓ Your Profile: Turn to the “Creating Your Personal Profile” section, 
earlier this chapter, for more information about creating a profile page.
Tools
The last menu item in the navigation menu (and subsequently in this chap-
ter!) is Tools. Click the Tools menu to drop down the submenu of links that 
includes:
 
✓ Import: WordPress gives you the ability to import from a different blog 
platform. This feature is covered in depth in the appendix.
 
✓ Export: WordPress also allows you to export your content from 
WordPress so you can import it into a different platform, or to another 
WordPress blog. This information is also covered in the appendix.
 
✓ Turbo: Click this link and you go to the Turbo page where you can enable 
the use of Google Gears. Google Gears is software provided by Google 
(the search engine people!) and it enables storage of your WordPress files 
in Google Gears so they are cached. What does this mean for you? Faster 
load time of your site for one thing — because the files are cached using 
Gears and makes the load time of your Administration panel significantly 
lower by decreasing the requests to the Web server. 
 
 In order to use Google Gears, you need a Google account and you need 
to give authorization for Gears to access your blog files.
 
✓ Update: This link takes you to the Upgrade WordPress page where you 
can automatically upgrade your WordPress software whenever a new 
upgrade is available. Click the Upgrade Automatically button and you 
are effortlessly taken through the upgrade process. Some Web host 
server configurations do not allow WordPress to access the automatic 
upgrade from within the Administration panel. If this is the case with 
your Web hosting situation, click the Download Nightly Build button to 
download the latest version of WordPress to your computer; then you 
can upload the files to your Web server via FTP. (See Chapter 6 for infor-
mation on using FTP to upload WordPress files.)

Establishing Your Blog Routine
In This Chapter
▶ Setting up categories
▶ Building your blogroll
▶ Exploring permalinks
▶ Writing and editing posts and pages
▶ Managing and moderating comments
W
ordPress is a powerful publishing tool, especially when you use the 
full range of options available. With the basic settings configured 
(which you do in Chapter 7), now is the time to go forth and blog! You can, 
at this point, skip to the “Blog It!: Writing Your First Entry” section in this 
chapter and jump right into creating new posts for your blog. Or you can stay 
right here with me and discover some of the options you can set to make 
your blog a bit more organized and logical from the get-go.
A blog can become unwieldy and disorganized, requiring you to revisit these 
next few features sometime in the near future so that you can get the beast 
under control. So why not do a little planning and get the work over with 
now? I promise it won’t take that long, and you’ll thank me for it later.
Staying on Topic with Categories
In WordPress, a category is what you determine to be the main topic of a blog 
post. Through the use of categories, you can file your blog posts into topics, 
by subject. To improve your readers’ experiences in navigating through 
your blog, WordPress organizes posts by the categories you assign to them. 

160
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
Visitors can click the categories they’re interested in to see the blog posts 
you’ve written on those particular topics. You should know ahead of time 
that the list of categories you set up is displayed on your blog in a few differ-
ent places, including the following:
 
✓ Body of the post: In most WordPress themes, you see the title followed 
by a statement such as Filed In: Category 1, Category 2. The reader can 
click the category name to go to a page that lists all the posts you’ve 
made in that particular category. You can assign a single post to more 
than one category.
 
✓ Sidebar of your blog theme: You can place a full list of category titles in 
the sidebar. A reader can click any category and get taken to a page on 
your site that lists the posts you’ve made within that particular category.
Subcategories (also known as category children) can further refine the main 
category topic by listing specific topics related to the main (parent) category. 
In your WordPress Administration panel, on the Manage Categories page, 
subcategories are listed directly below the main category. Here’s an example:
Books I Enjoy (main category)
 
Fiction (subcategory)
 
Nonfiction (subcategory)
 
Trashy romance (subcategory)
 
Biographies (subcategory)
 
For Dummies (subcategory)
Changing the name of a category
Upon installation, WordPress gives you one default category called 
Uncategorized (see the Categories page shown in Figure 8-1). That category 
name is pretty generic, so you’ll definitely want to change it to one that’s 
more specific to you. (On my blog, I changed it to Life in General. Although 
that name’s still a bit on the generic side, it doesn’t sound quite so . . . well, 
uncategorized.)
 
The default category also serves as kind of a fail-safe. If you publish a post to 
your blog and don’t assign that post to a category, the post automatically gets 
assigned to the default category, no matter what you name the category.
So how do you change the name of that default category? When you’re logged 
in to your WordPress Dashboard, just follow these steps:

161
 Chapter 8: Establishing Your Blog Routine
 
Figure 8-1: 
The 
Categories 
page of a 
brand-new 
blog shows 
the default 
Uncat-
egorized 
category.
 
 
1. Click the down arrow to the right of the Posts menu, and then click 
the Categories link.
 
 The Categories page opens, containing all the tools you need to set up 
and edit category titles for your blog.
 
2. Click the title of the category you would like to edit.
 
 If you want to change the Uncategorized category, click the word 
Uncategorized and you go to the Edit Category page (see Figure 8-2).
 
3. Type the new name for the category in the Category Name text box.
 
4. Type the new slug in the Category Slug text box.
 
 The term slug refers to the word(s) used in the Web address for the 
specific category. For example, the category of Books has a Web address 
of http://yourdomain.com/category/books; if you change the 
Category Slug to Books I Like, then the Web address is http://your
domain.com/category/books-i-like (WordPress automatically 
inserts a dash between the slug words in the Web address).
 
5. Choose a parent category from the Category Parent drop-down menu.
 
 If you want this category to be a main category, not a subcategory, 
choose None.

162
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
Figure 8-2:

WordPress 
on the Edit 
Category 
page.
 
 
6. (Optional) Type a description of the category in the Description 
text box.
 
 Use this description to remind yourself what your category is about. 
Some WordPress themes display the category description right on your 
site, too, which can be helpful for your visitors. (See Chapter 12 for more 
about themes.) You’ll know if your theme is coded in this way if your 
site displays the category description on the category page(s).
 
7. Click the Edit Category button.
 
 The information you just edited is saved, and the Categories page 
reloads, showing your new category name.
Creating new categories
Today, tomorrow, next month, next year — as your blog grows in size and 
age, you will continue adding new categories to further define and archive 
the history of your blog posts. You aren’t limited in the number of categories 
and subcategories you can create in your blog.

163
 Chapter 8: Establishing Your Blog Routine
Creating a new category is as easy as following these steps:
 
1. Click the down arrow to the right of the Posts menu, and then click 
the Categories link.
 
 The Categories page opens.
 
2. The left side of the Categories page displays the Add Category section.
 
 See Figure 8-3.
 
3. Type the name of your new category in the Category Name text box.
 
 Suppose that you want to create a category in which you file all your 
posts about the books you read. In the Category Name text box, type 
something like Books I Enjoy.
 
4. Type a name in the Category Slug text box.
 
 The category slug creates the link to the category page that lists all 
the posts you’ve made in this category. If you leave this field blank, 
WordPress automatically creates a slug based on the category name. 
If the category is Books I Enjoy, WordPress automatically creates a 
category slug like this: http://yourdomain.com/category/
books-i-enjoy. If you want to shorten it, however, you can! Type 
books in the Category Slug text box, and the link to the category 
becomes this: http://yourdomain.com/category/books.
 
Figure 8-3: 
Create a 
new cat-
egory on 
your blog.
 

164
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
5. Choose the category’s parent from the Category Parent drop-down menu.
 
 Choose None if you want this new category to be a parent category. If 
you’d like this category to be a subcategory of another category, choose 
the category you want to be the parent of this one.
 
6. (Optional) Type a description of the category in the Description text box.
 
 Some WordPress templates are set up to actually display the category 
description directly beneath the category name (see Chapter 12). 
Providing a description helps you to further define the category intent 
for your readers. The description can be as short or as long as you like.
 
7. Click the Add Category button.
 
 That’s it! You’ve added a new category to your blog. Armed with this 
information, you can add an unlimited number of categories to your blog.
You can delete a category on your blog by selecting the box to the left of the 
category name on the Categories page, and then select Delete in the Actions 
drop-down menu.
 
Deleting a category doesn’t delete the posts and links in that category. 
Instead, posts in the deleted category are assigned to the Uncategorized cate-
gory (or whatever you’ve named the default category). 
 
If you have an established WordPress blog with categories already created, 
you can convert some or all of your categories to tags. To do so, scroll to the 
bottom of the Categories page in the WordPress Administration panel, and 
click the category to Tag Converter link. (See the nearby sidebar “What are 
tags, and how/why do I use them?” for more information on tags.)
What are tags, and how/why do I use them?
Tags are not to be confused with categories, but 
a lot of people do confuse them. Tags are click-
able, comma-separated keywords that help you 
microcategorize a post by defining the topics in 
it. Unlike WordPress categories, tags do not 
have a hierarchy; there are no parent tags and 
child tags. If you write a post about your dog, 
for example, you can put that post in the Pets 
category — but you can also add some specific 
tags that let you get a whole lot more specific, 
such as poodle, small dogs. If someone clicks 
your poodle tag, he finds all the posts you’ve 
ever made that contain the poodle tag.
Another reason to use tags: Search-engine spi-
ders harvest tags when they crawl your site, so 
tags help other people find your site when they 
search for specific words.
You can manage your tags in the WordPress 
Administration panel by clicking the Tags link on 
the Pages menu. The Tags page opens where 
you can view, edit, delete, and add new tags.

165
 Chapter 8: Establishing Your Blog Routine
Link Lists: Sharing Your Favorite Sites
A link list, commonly referred to as a blogroll, is a list of links to other Web 
sites and blogs that you’ve collected and want to share with your readers. 
The link list is displayed in your blog, usually in the sidebar, through the use 
of widgets, or on a dedicated page of links, if your theme has a links page 
template (see Chapter 12 to find out how to create a template).
You can use a link list in various ways:
 
✓ Share links with other blogs that have linked to your blog.
 
✓ Provide additional resources that you think your readers will find useful.
 
✓ Provide links to other sites you own.
Organizing your links
As with posts, you can create multiple categories for your links in the 
WordPress Administration panel if you want to have more than one link list. 
Sometimes, having a large list of links below the heading Blogroll is just too 
generic, and you may want to display groups of links with different headings 
that further define them.
 
By default, WordPress provides one link category called Blogroll. You can 
keep this name as is or change it in the same way that you change a post cat-
egory name (refer to “Changing the name of a category,” earlier in this chap-
ter). Just click the name of the category and edit the details as you need to.
You can define your links by creating link categories in the Administration 
panel and then assigning links to the appropriate categories. To create link 
categories, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the down arrow to the right of the Links menu, and then click 
the Link Categories link.
 
 The Link Categories page opens, as shown in Figure 8-4. The left side of 
the Link Categories page displays the Add Category section.
 
2. Type the name of the link category in the Category Name box.
 
3. Type the slug of the link category in the Category Slug box.
 
 This entry is the same as the category slug described previously in the 
“Changing the name of a category” section in this chapter.

page.
 
 
4. (Optional) Type a description of the link category in the Category 
Description box.
 
 Providing a description helps you further define the category intent for 
your readers. The description can be as short or as long as you like. 
Some WordPress templates are set up to actually display the category 
description directly beneath the category name.
 
5. Click the Add Category button.
 
 The Link Categories page refreshes and displays your new link category.
Revisit the Link Categories page any time you want to add, edit, or delete a 
link. To edit or delete a link category, you would follow the same steps as you 
did in the previous section for post categories. You can create an unlimited 
amount of link categories to sort your link lists by topics. (I know one blogger 
who has 50 categories for his links.)
In Chapter 5, I show you how to display your link lists by using WordPress 
widgets, and in Chapter 12, I provide information about different ways you 
can display your link lists by using template tags.

Adding new link loves
You’ve created your link categories; now you just need to add some new 
links! To add a new link, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add New link on the Links menu. 
 
 The Add New Links page opens, as shown in Figure 8-5.
 
2. Type the name of the link in the Name text box.
 
 This is the actual name of the site that you are adding to your link list.
 
3. Type the URL of the link in the Web Address box.
 
 This is the destination you want your visitors to go to when they click 
the name of the site. Don’t forget to include the http:// part of the 
Web address; for example, http://lisasabin-wilson.com.
 
4. (Optional) Type a description of the site in the Description box.
 
 Providing a description helps further define the site for your readers. 
Some WordPress templates are coded to display the link description 
directly below the link name through the use of a specific WordPress 
template tag.
 
Figure 8-5: 
Add a new 
link with the 
Add New 
Links page.
 

168
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
5. (Optional) Select a category.
 
 Assign your new link to a category by checking the box to the left of the 
category you’ve chosen in the Categories module. If you don’t select a 
category for your new link, it’s automatically assigned to the default cat-
egory. Figure 8-6 shows the list of link categories I have in my blog. 
 
 If you find that the Link Category is not an option you use regularly, you 
can collapse (close) this module by clicking anywhere in the Categories 
title bar. You can also move the Categories module to a different posi-
tion on the Add New Link page by dragging and dropping it to a new 
location. 
 
Figure 8-6: 
You can 
assign a 
link to an 
existing 
category or 
add a new 
category 
here.
 
 
6. (Optional) Select a target for your new link.
 
 Click one of the following radio buttons in the Target section:
 
• _blank: Loads the link in a new browser window
 
• _top: Loads the link in the top frame (if your site is designed with 
frames)
 
• None: Loads the link in the same browser window
 
 The third option — None — is my personal preference and recommen-
dation. I like to let my visitors decide whether they want a bunch of new 
browser windows opening every time they click a link on my site.
 
 You can reposition the Target module by dragging and dropping it to 
a new location on the Add New Link page. You can also collapse this 
module.
 
7. Set the Link Relationship (XFN) options (Optional).
 
 XFN stands for XHTML Friends Network and allows you to indicate the 
relationship you have with the people you are linking to by defining how 
you know, or are associated with, them. Table 8-1 lists the different 
relationships you can assign to your links. Link Relationship (XFN) is 
kind of a silly bookmark-type assignment that indicates how well you 

169
 Chapter 8: Establishing Your Blog Routine
know the person whose site or blog you’re linking to by defining your 
relationship with her. You can find more information on XFN at http://
gmpg.org/xfn.
 
 You can reposition the Link Relationship module by dragging and drop-
ping it to a new location on the Add New Link page. You can also col-
lapse (close) this module.
Table 8-1 
Link Relationships Defined

Description
Identity
Check this box if the link is to a Web site you own.
Friendship
Choose the option (Contact, Acquaintance, Friend, or None) 
that most closely identifies the friendship, if any.
Physical
Check this box if you’ve met the person you’re linking to face 
to face. Sharing pictures over the Internet doesn’t count; this 
selection identifies a person you’ve physically met.
Professional
Check one of these boxes if the person you’re linking to is a 
co-worker or colleague.
Geographical
Choose Co-Resident if the person you’re linking to lives with 
you, or choose Neighbor or None, depending on which option 
applies to your relationship with the person you’re linking to.
Family
If the blogger you’re linking to is a family member, choose the 
option that tells how the person is related to you.
Romantic
Choose the option that applies to the type of romantic rela-
tionship, if any, you have with the person you’re linking to. Do 
you have a crush on him? Is she your creative muse or some-
one you consider to be a sweetheart?
 
8. Set the advanced options for your new link (see Figure 8-7).
 
 You have four options in the Advanced module:
 
• Image Address: Type the URL of the picture that you want to 
appear next to the link in your link list.
 
 This option associates an image with the link. To use it, you need 
to know the direct URL to the image source (such as http://
yourdomain.com/images/image.jpg).
 
 To find the URL for an image displayed on a Web site, right-click 
the image and choose Properties from the shortcut menu. Copy 
and paste all the text from the Address (URL) field to the Image 
Address box in the WordPress options box.
 
• RSS Address: Add the site’s RSS feed alongside the link that appears 
on your site. (Not all WordPress themes accommodate this feature.)

170
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
 To find the RSS URL of the site you’re linking to, visit that site, and 
locate the RSS link. (It’s usually listed in the sidebar or footer of the 
site.) Right-click the link, and from the shortcut menu, choose Copy 
Shortcut (in Internet Explorer) or Copy Link Location (in Firefox). 
Then, in WordPress, paste the link in the RSS Address field.
 
• Notes: Type your notes in the Notes field.
 
 These notes aren’t displayed on your site, so feel free to enter 
whatever notes you need to further define the details of this link. 
A month from now, you may not remember who this person is 
or why you linked to her, so here is where you can add notes to 
remind yourself.
 
• Rating: Use the Rating drop-down menu to rate the link from 0–10, 
0 being the worst and 10 being the best. Some WordPress themes 
display your link list in the order in which you’ve rated your links, 
from best to worst.
 
 You can reposition the Advanced module by dragging and dropping it to 
a new location on the Add New Link page. You can also collapse (close) 
this module.
 
9. To save your changes, scroll up to the top of the Add New Links page 
and click the Save button. Choose whether to make the link public or 
private.
 
 To keep the link private, select the Keep This Link Private box. No one 
you can see the link. If you want the link to be publicly displayed on 
your blog, leave that box unchecked.
 
 You can reposition the Save module by dragging and dropping it to a 
new location on the Add New Link page. You can also collapse (close) 
this module.
 
 A blank Add New Links page opens, ready for you to add another new link!

 Chapter 8: Establishing Your Blog Routine
Editing existing links
You can edit the links in your blog by clicking the Edit link on the Links 
menu; the Edit Links page opens. 
 
When you first view the Edit Links page, some links are already assigned to 
your blog. By default, WordPress provides seven links in your link list. These 
links go to some helpful Web sites that contain information and resources for 
the WordPress software. You can delete these links, but I recommend saving 
them for future reference.
Here’s what you can do with your links:
 
✓ Edit an existing link: Click the name of the link you’d like to edit. The 
Edit Link page opens. Edit the fields you need to change; click the Save 
button at the top right of the page.
 
✓ Sort the links: You can sort by Link ID, Name, Address, or Rating by 
using the Order by Name drop-down menu. Likewise, you can sort your 
links by category by using the View All Categories drop-down menu and 
selecting the Link Category you’d like to filter your links by.
 
✓ Search for specific links using keywords and phrases: Enter your key-
word in the text box at the top right hand side of the Edit Links page and 
click the Search Links button. If any links match the keywords and/or 
phrase you typed, they display on the page.
Examining a Blog Post’s Address: 
Permalinks
Each WordPress blog post is assigned its own Web page, and the address 
(or URL) of that page is called a permalink. Posts that you see in WordPress 
blogs usually have the post permalink in four typical areas:
 
✓ The title of the blog post
 
✓ The Comments link below the post
 
✓ A Permalink link that appears (in most themes) below the post
 
✓ The titles of posts appearing in a Recent Posts sidebar
Permalinks are meant to be permanent links to your blog posts (which is 
where the perma part of that word comes from, in case you’re wondering). 
Other bloggers can use a post permalink to refer to that particular blog post. 
So ideally, the permalink of a post never changes. WordPress creates the per-
malink automatically when you publish a new post.

172
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
By default, a blog post permalink in WordPress looks like this:
http://yourdomain.com/?p=100/
The p stands for post, and 100 is the ID assigned to the individual post. You 
can leave the permalinks in this format, if you don’t mind letting WordPress 
associate each post with an ID number.
WordPress, however, lets you take your permalinks to the beauty salon for a 
bit of makeover so you can create pretty permalinks. I’ll bet you didn’t know 
that permalinks could be pretty, did you? They certainly can. Allow me to 
explain.
Making your post links pretty
Pretty permalinks are links that are more pleasing to the eye than standard 
links and, ultimately, more pleasing to search-engine spiders. (See Chapter 14 
for an explanation of why search engines like pretty permalinks.) Pretty per-
malinks look something like this:
http://yourdomain.com/2008/01/01/pretty-permalinks/
Break down that URL, and you see the date when the post was made, in 
year/month/day format. You also see the topic of the post.
To choose how your permalinks look, click Permalinks in the Settings menu. 
The Permalink Settings page opens (see Figure 8-8).
In this page, you find several options for creating permalinks:
 
✓ Default (ugly permalinks): WordPress assigns an ID number to each 
blog post and creates the URL in this format: http://yourdomain.
com/?p=100.
 
✓ Day and Name (pretty permalinks): For each post, WordPress generates 
a permalink URL that includes the year, month, day, and post slug/title: 
http://yourdomain.com/2008/01/01/sample-post/.
 
✓ Month and Name (also pretty permalinks): For each post, WordPress 
generates a permalink URL that includes the year, month, and post slug/
title: http://yourdomain.com/2008/01/sample-post/.
 
✓ Numeric (not so pretty): WordPress assigns a numerical value to the 
permalink. The URL is created in this format: http://yourdomain.
com/archives/123.
 
✓ Custom Structure: WordPress creates permalinks in the format you 
choose. You can create a custom permalink structure by using tags or 
variables, as I discuss in the next section.

173
 Chapter 8: Establishing Your Blog Routine
 
Figure 8-8: 
Make your 
permalinks 
pretty.
 
To create the pretty-permalink structure, select the Day and Name radio 
button; then click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the page.
Customizing your permalinks
A custom permalink structure is one that lets you define which variables you 
want to see in your permalinks by using the tags in Table 8-2.
Table 8-2 
Custom Permalinks 
Permalink Tag
Results
%year%
4-digit year (such as 2007)
%monthnum%
2-digit month (such as 02 for February)

2-digit hour of the day (such as 15 for 3 p.m.)

2-digit second (such as 10)
(continued)

174
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
Table 8-2 (continued) 
Permalink Tag
Results
%postname%
Text — usually, the post name — separated by hyphens 
(such as making-pretty-permalinks)
%post_id%
The unique numerical ID of the post (such as 344)
%category%
The text of the category name that you filed the post in 
(such as books-i-read)
%author%
The text of the post author’s name (such as lisa-
sabin-wilson)
If you want your permalink to show the year, month, day, category, and 
post name, you’d select the Custom Structure radio button in the Customize 
Permalink Structure page and type the following tags in the Custom Structure 
text box:
/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%category%/%postname%/
Under this permalink format, the link for a post made on February 1, 2008, 
called WordPress For Dummies and filed in the Books I Read category, would 
look like this:
http://yourdomain.com/2008/01/01/books-i-read/wordpress-for-dummies/
 
Be sure to include the slashes before tags, between tags, and at the very 
end of the string of tags. This format ensures that WordPress creates cor-
rect, working permalinks by using the correct re_write rules located in the 
.htaccess file for your site. (See the following section for more information 
on re_write rules and .htaccess files.)
 
Changing the structure of your permalinks in the future affects the perma-
links for all the posts on your blog . . . new and old. Keep this fact in mind if 
you ever decide to change the permalink structure. An especially important 
reason: Search engines (such as Google and Yahoo!) index the posts on your 
site by their permalinks, so changing the permalink structure makes all those 
indexed links obsolete.
Don’t forget to click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the Customize 
Permalink Structure page; otherwise your permalink changes aren’t saved!

175
 Chapter 8: Establishing Your Blog Routine
Making sure that your permalinks 
work with your server
After you set the format for the permalinks for your site by using any options 
other than the default, WordPress writes specific rules, or directives, to the 
.htaccess file on your Web sever. The .htaccess file in turn communi-
cates to your Web server how it should serve up the permalinks, according 
to the permalink structure you’ve chosen to use.
To use an htaccess file, you need to know the answers to two questions:
 
✓ Does your Web server configuration use and give you access to the 
.htaccess file?
 
✓ Does your Web server run Apache with the mod_rewrite module?
If you don’t know the answers, contact your hosting provider to find out.
If the answer to both questions is yes, proceed to the next section. If the 
answer is no, skip to the “Working with servers that don’t use Apache mod_
rewrite” section, later in this chapter.
Creating .htaccess files
You and WordPress work together in glorious harmony to create the 
.htaccess file that lets you use a pretty permalink structure in your blog. 
The file works like this:
 
1. Using a plain-text editor (such as Notepad for Windows or TextEdit for a 
Mac), create a blank file; name it htaccess.txt; and upload it to your 
Web server via FTP. (See Chapter 6 for more information about FTP.) 
When the file is on your Web server, rename the file .htaccess (notice 
the period at the beginning), and make sure that it is writable by the 
server by changing permissions to either 755 or 777. (See Chapter 6 for 
information on changing permissions on server files.)
 
 If .htaccess already exists, you can find it in the root of your directory 
on your Web server — that is, the same directory where you find your 
wp-config.php file. If you don’t see it in the root directory, try chang-
ing the options of your FTP client to show hidden files. (Because the 
.htaccess file starts with a period [.], it may not be visible until you 
configure your FTP client to show hidden files.)
 
2. Create the permalink structure in the Customize Permalink Structure 
page in your WordPress Administration panel.

176
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
3. Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the Customize Permalink 
Structure page.
 
 WordPress inserts into the .htaccess file the specific rules necessary 
for making the permalink structure functional in your blog.
If you followed these steps correctly, you have an .htaccess file on your 
Web server that has the correct permissions set so that WordPress can write 
the correct rules to it. Your pretty permalink structure works flawlessly. 
Kudos!
If you open the .htaccess file and look at it now, you’ll see that it’s no 
longer blank. It should have a set of code in it called rewrite rules, which looks 
something like this:
# BEGIN WordPress
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
# END WordPress
 
I could delve deeply into .htaccess and all the things you can do with this 
file, but I’m restricting this section to how it applies to WordPress permalink 
structures. If you’d like to unlock more mysteries about .htaccess, check 
out “Comprehensive Guide to .htaccess” at http://javascriptkit.com/
howto/htaccess.shtml.
Working with servers that don’t use Apache mod_rewrite
Using permalink structures requires that your Web hosting provider has a 
specific Apache module option called mod_rewrite activated on its servers. 
If your Web hosting provider doesn’t have this item activated on its servers, 
or if you’re hosting your site on a Windows server, the custom permalinks 
work only if you type index.php in front of any custom permalink tags.
For example, create the custom permalink tags like this:
/index.php/%year%/%month%/%date%/%postname%/
This format creates a permalink like this:
http://yourdomain.com/index.php/2008/02/01/wordpress-for-
dummies
You don’t need an .htaccess file to use this permalink structure.

 Chapter 8: Establishing Your Blog Routine
Discovering the Many WordPress 
RSS Options
In Chapter 2, you can read about RSS feed technology and why it’s an 
important part of publishing your blog. Allow me to quote myself from that 
chapter: For your blog readers to stay updated with the latest and greatest 
content you post to your site, they need to subscribe to your RSS feed.
RSS feeds come in different flavors, including RSS 0.92, RDF/RSS 1.0, RSS 
2.0, and Atom. The differences among them lie within the base code that 
makes up the functionality of the syndication feed. What’s important is that 
WordPress supports all versions of RSS — which means that anyone can sub-
scribe to your RSS feed with any type of feed reader available.
I mention many times throughout this book that WordPress is very intui-
tive, and this section on RSS feeds is a shining example of a feature that 
WordPress automates. WordPress has a built-in feed generator that works 
behind the scenes to create feeds for you. This feed generator creates feeds 
from your posts, comments, and even categories.
The RSS feed for your blog posts is autodiscoverable, which means that 
almost all RSS feed readers and even some browsers (Firefox, Internet 
Explorer 7, and Safari, for example) automatically detect the RSS feed URL for 
a WordPress blog. Table 8-3 gives you some good guidelines on how to find 
the RSS feed URLs for the different sections of your blog.
Table 8-3 
URLs for Built-In WordPress Feeds
Feed Type
Example Feed URL
RSS 0.92
http://yourdomain.com/wp-rss.php or
http://yourdomain.com/?feed=rss
RDF/RSS 1.0
http://yourdomain.com/wp-rss2.php 
or
http://yourdomain.com/?feed=rdf
RSS 2.0
http://yourdomain.com/wp-rss2.php 
or
http://yourdomain.com/?feed=rss2
Atom
http://yourdomain.com/wp-atom.php 
or
http://yourdomain.com/?feed=atom
(continued)

178
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
Table 8-3 (continued)
Feed Type
Example Feed URL
Comments RSS
http://yourdomain.
com/?feed=rss&p=50
p stands for post, and 50 is the post ID. You can 
find the post ID in the Administration panel by click-
ing the Manage tab. The post ID is listed immedi-
ately to the left of the post title.
Category RSS
http://yourdomain.com/wp-rss2.
php?cat=50
cat stands for category, and 50 is the category ID. 
You can find the category ID in the Administration 
panel by clicking the Manage tab and then the 
Categories subtab. The category ID is listed imme-
diately to the left of the category title.
 
If you’re using custom permalinks (see “Making your post links pretty,” earlier 
in this chapter), you can simply add /feed to the end of any URL on your blog 
to find the RSS feed. Some of your links will look similar to these:
 
✓ http://yourdomain.com/feed — your main RSS feed
 
✓ http://yourdomain.com/comments/feed — your comments 
RSS feed
 
✓ http://yourdomain.com/category/cat-name/feed — RSS feed 
for a category
Try it with any URL on your site. Add /feed at the end, and you’ll have the 
RSS feed for that page.
RSS feeds are important parts of delivering content from your blog to your 
readers. RSS feeds are expected these days, so the fact that WordPress has 
taken care of the feeds for you, is compliant with all RSS formats, and offers 
so many internal feeds gives the software a huge advantage over any of the 
other blog-software platforms.
 
If you intend to use the Atom publishing protocol, you need to enable it manu-
ally because it is disabled by default. Click the Writing link on the Settings 
menu, and then check the two boxes in the Remote Publishing section to 
enable Atom publishing in WordPress.

Blog It!: Writing Your First Entry
It’s finally time to write your first post in your new WordPress blog! The topic 
you choose to write about and the writing techniques you use to get your 
message across are all on you; I have my hands full writing this book! I can 
tell you, however, how to write the wonderful passages that could bring you 
blog fame. Ready?
Composing your blog post
Composing a blog post is a lot like typing an e-mail: You give it a title, you 
write the message, and you click a button to send your words into the world. 
 
You can collapse or reposition all the modules on the Add New Posts page to 
suit your needs. The only section on the Add New Posts page that cannot be 
collapsed and repositioned is the actual title and post box (where you write 
your blog post).
Follow these steps to write a basic blog post:
 
1. Click the Add New link on the Posts menu.
 
 The Add New Post page opens, as shown in Figure 8-9.
 
2. Type the title of your post in the Title text box.
 
3. Type the content of your post in the Post text box.
 
 You can use the Visual Text Editor to format the text in your post. I 
explain the Visual Text Editor and the buttons and options after these 
steps.
 
4. Click the Save Draft button in the Publish module, located at the top 
right side of the Add New Post page. 
 
 The page refreshed with your post title and content saved, but not yet 
published to your blog.
By default, the area in which you write your post is in Visual Editing mode, 
as indicated by the Visual tab that appears above the text. Visual Editing 
mode is how WordPress provides WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) 
options for formatting. Rather than have to embed HTML code in your post, 
you can simply type your post, highlight the text you want to format, and 
click the buttons (shown in Figure 8-9) that appear above the box in which 
you type your post.

If you’ve ever used a word processing program, such as Microsoft Word, 
you’ll recognize many of these buttons:
 
✓ Bold: Embeds the <strong> </strong> HTML tag to emphasize the 
text in bold. Example: Bold Text.
 
✓ Italic: Embeds the <em> </em> HTML tag to emphasize the text in ital-
ics. Example: Italic Text.
 
✓ Strikethrough: Embeds the <strike> </strike> HTML tag that puts 
a line through your text. Example: Strikethrough Text.
 
✓ Unordered List: Embeds the <ul><li> </li></ul> HTML tags that 
create an unordered, or bulleted, list.
 
✓ Ordered List: Embeds the <ol><li> </li></ol> HTML tags that 
create an ordered, or numbered, list.
 
✓ Blockquote: Inserts the <blockquote> </blockquote> HTML tag 
that indents the paragraph or section of text you’ve selected.
 
✓ Align Left: Inserts the <p align=”left”> </p> HTML tag that lines 
up the paragraph or section of text you’ve selected against the left 
margin.
 
✓ Align Center: Inserts the <p align=”center”> </p> HTML tag that 
positions the paragraph or section of text you’ve selected in the center 
of the page.

181
 Chapter 8: Establishing Your Blog Routine
 
✓ Align Right: Inserts the <p align=”right”> </p> HTML tag that 
lines up the paragraph or section of text you’ve selected against the 
right margin.
 
✓ Insert/Edit Link: Inserts the <a href=” “> </a> HTML tag around the 
text you’ve selected to create a hyperlink.
 
✓ Unlink: Removes the hyperlink from the selected text, if it was previously 
linked.
 
✓ Insert More Tag: Inserts the <!--more--> tag, which lets you split the 
display on your blog page. It publishes the text written above this tag 
with a Read More link, which takes the user to a page with the full post. 
This feature is good for really long posts.
 
✓ Toggle Spellchecker: Perfect for typo enthusiasts! Checking your spell-
ing before you post is always a good idea.
 
✓ Toggle Full Screen Mode: Lets you focus purely on writing, without 
the distraction of all the other options on the page. Click this button, 
and the Post text box expands to fill the full height and width of your 
browser screen. To bring the Post text box back to its normal state, click 
the Toggle Full Screen button again. Voilà — it’s back to normal!
 
✓ Show/Hide Kitchen Sink: I saw this button and thought, “Wow! 
WordPress does my dishes, too!” Unfortunately, the button’s name is a 
metaphor that describes the advanced formatting options available with 
the Visual Text Editor. Click this button, and a new formatting menu drops 
down, providing options for underlining, font color, custom characters, 
undo and redo, and so on — a veritable kitchen sink full of options!
You can turn off the Visual Text Editor by clicking the Your Profile link on the 
Users menu. Uncheck the Use the Visual Editor When Writing box to turn off 
this editor if you’d rather insert the HTML code yourself in your posts.
 
If you’d rather embed your own HTML code and skip the Visual Text Editor, 
click the HTML tab that appears to the right of the Visual tab. If you’re planning 
to type HTML code in your post — for a table or video files, for example, — 
you have to click the HTML tab before you insert that code. If you don’t, the 
Visual Text Editor formats your code, and it most likely will look nothing like 
you intended it to.
At this point, you can skip to the “Publishing your post” section of this chap-
ter for information on publishing your post to your blog, or continue with the 
following sections to discover how to refine the options for your post.
 
WordPress has a nifty, built-in autosave feature that saves your work while 
you’re typing and editing a new post. If your browser crashes or you acci-
dentally close your browser window before you’ve saved your post, it will be 
there for you when you get back. Those WordPress folks are so thoughtful!

Dressing up your posts with 
images, video, and audio
Directly above and to the left of the Visual Text Editor row of buttons is an 
Add Media area with a row of four icons. These icons let you insert images/
photos, photo galleries, videos, and audio files into your posts. WordPress 
has an entire Media Library capability, which I describe in great detail in 
Chapter 9.
Refining your post options
After you write the post, you can choose a few extra options before you 
publish it for the entire world to see. These settings apply to the post you’re 
currently working on — not to any future or past posts. You can find these 
options below and to the right of the Post text box (see Figure 8-10). Click the 
title of each option — the settings for that specific option expand.
 
You can reposition the different post option modules on the Add New Post 
page to fit the way you use this page. 
 
Figure 8-10: 
Several 
options are 
available for 
your blog 
post.
 

183
 Chapter 8: Establishing Your Blog Routine
Here are the options found underneath the Post text box:
 
✓ Excerpt: Excerpts are short summaries of your posts. Many bloggers 
use snippets to show teasers of their blog posts, thereby encourag-
ing the reader to click the Read More links to read the posts in their 
entirety. Type your short summary in the Excerpt box. Excerpts can be 
any length, in terms of words; however, the point is to keep it short and 
sweet and tease your readers into clicking the Read More link.
 
✓ Send Trackbacks: I discuss trackbacks in Chapter 2, if you’d like to 
refresh your memory banks on what they are. If you want to send a 
trackback to another blog, enter the blog’s trackback URL in the Send 
Trackbacks To box. You can send trackbacks to more than one blog; just 
be sure to separate trackback URLs with spaces.
 
✓ Custom Fields: Custom fields add extra data to your posts and are fully 
configurable by you. 
 
✓ Discussion: Decide whether to let readers submit comments through 
the comment system by checking Allow Comments on this Post box. By 
default, the box is checked; uncheck it to disallow comments on this post.
Here are the options found to the right of the Post text box:
 
✓ Publish: These are the publishing options for your post, which I covered 
in the “Publishing your post” section.
 
✓ Tags: Type your desired tags in the Add New Tag text box. Be sure to 
separate each tag with a comma so that WordPress knows where each 
tag begins and ends. Cats, Kittens, Feline represents three different tags, 
for example, but without the commas, WordPress would consider those 
three words to be one tag. See the sidebar “What are tags, and how/why 
do I use them?” earlier in this chapter for more information on tags.
 
✓ Categories: You can file your posts in different categories to organize 
them by subject. (See more about organizing your posts by category in 
“Staying on Topic with Categories,” earlier in this chapter.) Check the box 
to the left of the category you want to use. You can toggle between listing 
all categories on your blog, or just the categories you use the most often 
by clicking the All Categories or Most Used links, respectively. Don’t see 
the category you need listed here? Click the + Add New Category link, and 
you can add a category right there on the Add New Post page!
 
✓ Privacy Options: You can password-protect your post by creating a 
password and entering it in this box. When you do, you can share the 
password with only the readers you want to let read that post. This 
feature is perfect for those times when you’d love to make a blog post 
about all the stupid things your boss did today, but don’t want your 
boss to see it (not that my boss ever does anything stupid; I’m just using 
an obscure example!). This feature also hides the post from search 
engines so that it doesn’t show up in search results. If you don’t want to 
password-protect the post, leave this box blank.

184
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
When you finish setting the options for your post, don’t navigate away from 
this page; your options have not yet been fully saved. The next section on pub-
lishing your post covers all the options you need for saving your post settings!
Publishing your post
You have given your new post a title and written the content of your new 
blog post. Maybe you’ve even added an image or other type of media file to 
your blog post (see Chapter 9), and have configured the tags, categories, and 
other options. Now the question is: Publish? Or not to publish (yet)?
WordPress gives you three options for saving or publishing your post when 
you’re done writing it. The Publish box is located on the right side of the Add 
New (or Edit) Post page. Just click the title of the Publish box to expand the 
settings you need. Figure 8-11 shows the available options in the Publish box.
 
Figure 8-11: 
The publish 
status for 
your blog 
posts.
 
The Publish module has several options:
 
✓ Save Draft: Choose this option to save your post as a draft. The Edit 
Post page reloads with all your post contents and options saved; you 
can continue editing it now, tomorrow, or the next day. To access your 
draft posts, click the Edit link on the Posts menu.
 
✓ Preview: Click the Preview button to view your post in a new window, as 
it would appear on your live blog if you had published it. Previewing the 
post doesn’t publish it to your site yet. It gives you the opportunity to 
view it on your site and check it for any formatting or content changes 
you’d like to make.

185
 Chapter 8: Establishing Your Blog Routine
 
✓ Status: Click the Edit link to open the settings for this option. A drop-
down menu appears and you can select Draft or Pending Review:
 
• Select Draft to save the post, but not publish it to your blog.
 
• Select Pending Review and the post shows up in your list of drafts 
next to a Pending Review header. This option lets the administra-
tor of the blog know that contributors have entered posts that are 
waiting for administrator review and approval (helpful for blogs 
with multiple authors).
 
 Click the OK button to save your settings.
 
✓ Stick This Post to the Front Page: Select this box to have WordPress 
publish the post to your blog and keep it at the very top of all blog posts 
until you edit this post and change this setting.
 
 This is otherwise known as a sticky post. Typically, posts are displayed 
in a chronological order on your blog, displaying the most recent post 
on top. If you make a post sticky, it remains at the very top no matter 
how many other posts you make after it. When you want to un-stick the 
post, deselect the Stick This Post to the Front Page box.
 
✓ Publish Immediately: Click the Edit link and you can set the timestamp 
for your post. If you want the post have the current time and date, 
ignore this setting altogether.
 
 If you’d like to future-publish this post, you can set the time and date 
for anytime in the future. This feature has come in handy for me many 
times. For example, when I have a vacation planned and I don’t want my 
blog to go without updates while I’m gone, I’ll sit down and write a few 
posts and set the date for a time in the future. They’re published to my 
blog while I was somewhere tropical, diving with the fishes.
 
✓ Publish: This button wastes no time! It bypasses all the previous draft, 
pending review and sticky settings and publishes the post directly to 
your blog immediately.
After you choose an option from the drop-down menu, click the Save button. 
The Write Post page saves your publishing-status option.
 
If you want to publish your post right away, skip all the other options in the 
Publish module, and just click the Publish button. This method eliminates the 
fuss with the Publish Status options and sends your new post to your blog in 
all its glory.
 
If you click Publish and for some reason don’t see the post you just published 
on the front page of your blog, you probably left the Publish Status drop-down 
menu set to Unpublished. You’ll find your new post in the draft posts, which 
you’ll find by clicking the Edit link on the Posts menu.

You are your own editor
While I write this book, I have editors looking over my shoulder, making rec-
ommendations, correcting my typos and grammatical errors, and helping me 
out by telling me when I get too long-winded. You, on the other hand, are not 
so lucky! You are your own editor and have full control of what you write, 
when you write it, and how you write it. You can always go back and edit 
previous posts to correct typos, grammatical errors, and other mistakes by 
following these steps:
 
1. Find the post that you want to edit by clicking the Edit link on the 
Posts menu.
 
 The Edit Posts page opens and lists the 20 most recent posts you’ve 
made to your blog.
 
 You can filter that listing of posts by date by choosing a date from the Show 
All Dates drop-down menu at the top of the Edit Posts page. For example, 
if you choose November 2008, the Edit Posts page reloads, displaying only 
those posts that were published in the month of November 2008.
 
 You can also filter the post listing by category. Select your desired 
category from the View All Categories drop down menu.
 
2. When you find the post you need, click its title.
 
 The Edit Post window opens. In this window, you can edit the post and/
or any of its options.
 
 You can also click the Edit link that appears beneath the post title on the 
Edit Posts page.
 
 If you only need to edit the post options, click the Quick Edit link. The 
post options open and you can configure post options like the title, 
status, password, categories, tags, comments, and timestamp. Click the 
Save button to save your changes.
 
3. Edit your post; then click the Update Post button.
 
 The Edit Post window refreshes with all of your changes saved.
Look Who’s Talking on Your Blog
The feature that really catapulted blogging into the limelight is the comments 
feature, which lets visitors interact with the authors of blogs. I cover the 
concept of blog comments and trackbacks in Chapter 2. They provide a great 
way for readers to interact with site owners, and vice versa.

187
 Chapter 8: Establishing Your Blog Routine
Managing comments and trackbacks
To find your comments, click the Comments link on the Comments menu; the 
Edit Comments page opens (see Figure 8-12).
 
Figure 8-12: 
Clicking the 
Comments 
menu shows 
you the Edit 
Comments 
page, with 
all the com-
ments and 
trackbacks 
on your blog.
 
When you hover over the comment with your mouse, several links appear 
that give you the opportunity to manage those comments:
 
✓ Unapprove: This link only appears if you have comment moderation 
turned on and appear with approved comments only. The comment 
is placed in the moderation queue, which you get to by clicking the 
Awaiting Moderation link that appears below the Manage Comments 
header. The moderation queue is kind of a holding area for comments 
that haven’t yet been published to your blog. (See the following section 
for more on the moderation queue.)
 
✓ Spam: Click this link to mark the comment as spam and toss it into the 
spam bin where it will never be heard from again!
 
✓ Delete: This link does exactly what it says; it deletes the link completely 
from your blog.

188
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
 
✓ Edit: Click this link to open the Edit Comment page where you can edit 
the different fields, such as name, e-mail, URL, and comment content 
(see Figure 8-13).
 
✓ Quick Edit: Click this link and, without ever leaving the Edit Comments 
page, the comment options open and you can configure the post options 
like name, e-mail, URL, and comment content. Click the Save button to 
save your changes.
 
✓ Reply: Click this link and a text box drops down where you can type and 
submit your reply to this person. This feature eliminates the need to 
have to load your live site in order to reply to a comment.
 
Figure 8-13: 
Edit a user’s 
comment 
in the Edit 
Comment 
page.
 
 
If you have a lot of comments listed in this page and want to bulk-edit them, 
check the boxes to the left of all the comments you want to manage; then 
select one of the following from the Actions drop-down menu at the top left of 
the Edit Comments page: Approve, Mark As Spam, Unapprove, or Delete.

189
 Chapter 8: Establishing Your Blog Routine
Moderating comments and trackbacks
If you have your options set so that comments aren’t published to your blog 
until you approve them, you can approve comments from the Edit Comments 
page as well. Just click the Pending link, and you go to the Edit Comments 
page. If you have comments and/or trackbacks awaiting moderation, you 
see them on this page, and you can approve them, mark them as spam, or 
delete them.
A nice feature of WordPress is that it immediately notifies you of any com-
ments sitting in the moderation queue, awaiting your action. This notifica-
tion, which appears on every single page, is a small orange conversation 
bubble that appears in the left navigation menu, to the right of the Comments 
menu. Figure 8-14 shows that I have 10 comments awaiting moderation. I’d 
better get busy and deal with those comments!

Tackling spam with Akismet
I touch on Akismet a few times throughout this book. Why do I discuss it so 
much? Only because it’s my humble opinion that Akismet is the mother of all 
plugins and that no WordPress blog is complete without a fully activated ver-
sion of Akismet running in it.
Apparently WordPress agrees, because the plugin is packaged in every 
WordPress software release beginning with version 2.0. Akismet was created 
by the folks at Automattic, the same folks who brought you the WordPress.
com hosted version (discussed in Part II of this book). Automattic also works 
with of some of the original developers of the WordPress software platform.

190
Part III: Self-Hosting with WordPress.org 
Akismet is the answer to combatting comment and trackback spam. Matt 
Mullenweg of Automattic says Akismet is a “collaborative effort to make com-
ment and trackback spam a non-issue and restore innocence to blogging, so 
you never have to worry about spam again” (from the Akismet Web site at 
http://akismet.com).
I’ve been blogging since 2002. I started blogging with the Movable Type blog-
ging platform and moved to WordPress in 2003. As blogging became more 
and more popular, comment and trackback spam became more and more 
of a nuisance. One morning in 2004, I found that 2,300 pieces of disgusting 
comment spam had been published to my blog. Something had to be done! 
The folks at Automattic did a fine thing with Akismet. Since the emergence of 
Akismet, I’ve barely had to think about comment or trackback spam except 
for the few times a month I check my Akismet spam queue.
I talk in greater detail about plugin use in WordPress in Chapter 10, where 
you find out how to activate Akismet and make sure that it is protecting your 
blog from trackback and comment spam.

Part IV
Flexing and 
Extending 
WordPress

In this part . . .
R
eady? Set? Action! This part of the book starts by 
showing you how to add media files — images, 
video, and audio — to your site to create a fun, interactive 
experience for your readers. This part also covers using 
WordPress plugins to extend the capabilities of your blog, 
and finding and using free WordPress themes to change 
the look of your blog.

Chapter 9
Media Management: Images, 
Audio, and Video
In This Chapter
▶ Adding images and photo galleries to your blog posts
▶ Adding videos to your blog posts
▶ Uploading audio files
▶ Exploring the WordPress Media Library
A
dding images and photos to your posts can really dress up the content. 
By using images and photos, you give your content a dimension that 
you can’t express in plain text. Through visual imagery, you can call attention 
to your post and add depth to it.
The same goes for adding video and audio files to your posts and blog. Video 
lets you provide entertainment through moving, talking (or singing!) stream-
ing video. Audio files let you talk to your visitors and add a personal touch. 
Many bloggers use video and audio to report news and to broadcast Internet 
radio and television shows. The possibilities are endless!
In Chapter 8, I discuss the mechanics of composing and publishing a post to 
your blog. In this chapter, you discover how to add some special touches to 
your blog posts by adding images, video, and audio to your blog posts, and 
even find out how to run a full-fledged photo gallery on your site, all through 
the WordPress.org software and its integrated Media Library. This chapter is 
pertinent to the WordPress.org platform only. 
 
If you’re using the hosted WordPress.com version, check out Chapter 4 for 
information on adding images, video and audio to your blog.

194
Part IV: Flexing and Extending WordPress 
You add these extras to your blog posts in the Add Media area of the Write 
Post page. You can add them as you’re writing your post, or come back and 
add them later. The choice is yours!
Inserting Images into Your Blog Posts
Adding images to a post is pretty easy with the WordPress image uploader. 
Jump right in and give it a go by clicking the Upload an Image icon on the Add 
New Post page. The Add an Image window lets you choose images from your 
hard drive or from a location on the Web (see Figure 9-1). 
 
Figure 9-1: 
The 
WordPress 
Add an 
Image 
window.
 
 
The interface that WordPress uses for file uploads is based on Adobe Flash. 
Flash is a specific set of multimedia technologies programmed to handle 
media files on the Web. Some browsers and operating systems are not config-
ured to handle Flash-based applications. If you experience difficulties with the 
image uploader, WordPress gives you an easy alternative. Click the Browser 
Uploader link in the image uploader and you can use a non-Flash based 
uploader to transfer your files.

195
 Chapter 9: Media Management: Images, Audio, and Video
To add an image from the Web after you click the Add an Image icon, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the From URL tab in the Add an Image window.
 
 The Add Media File from URL window opens.
 
2. Type the URL (Internet address) of the image in the Image URL 
text box.
 
 Type the full URL, including the http and www portion of the address. 
You can easily find the URL of any image on the Web by right-clicking 
(PC) or Control-clicking (Mac) and selecting Properties from the menu.
 
3. Type a title for the image in the Image Title text box.
 
4. (Optional) Type the caption of the image in the Image Caption text box.
 
 The words you type here display underneath the image on your blog as 
a caption.
 
5. Choose an alignment option by selecting the None, Left, Center, or 
Right radio button.
 
6. Type the URL you want the image linked to. 
 
 Whatever option you choose determines where your readers go when 
they click the image you’ve uploaded:
 
• None: You don’t want the image to be clickable. 
 
• Link to Image: Readers can click through to the direct image itself.
 
7. Click the Insert into Post button.
To add an image from your own hard drive after you click the Add an Image 
icon, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the From Computer tab and then click the Select Files button.
 
 A dialog box opens from which you can select an image (or multiple 
images) from your hard drive.
 
2. Select your image(s); then click Open.
 
 The image is uploaded from your computer to your Web server. 
WordPress displays a progress bar on the upload and displays an image 
options box when the upload is finished. 
 
3. Edit the details for the image(s) by clicking the Show link that appears 
to the right of the image thumbnail.

196
Part IV: Flexing and Extending WordPress 
 
 Clicking Show drops down a box (see Figure 9-2) that contains several 
image options:
 
• Title: Type a title for the image.
 
• Caption: Type a caption for the image (such as This is a flower 
from my garden).
 
• Description: Type a description of the image.
 
• Link URL: Type the URL you want the image linked to. Whatever 
option you choose determines where your readers go when they 
click the image you’ve uploaded:
 
 None: You don’t want the image to be clickable. 
 
 File URL: Readers can click through to the direct image itself. 
 
 Post URL: Readers can click through to the post that the image 
appears in. You can type your own URL in the Link URL text box.
 
• Alignment: Choose None, Left, Center, or Right. (See Table 9-1, in the 
following section, for styling information regarding image alignment.)
 
• Size: Choose Thumbnail, Medium, Large, or Full Size.
 
 WordPress automatically creates small and medium-size versions of the 
images you upload through the built-in image uploader. A thumbnail is a 
smaller version of the original file. You can edit the size of the thumbnail 
by clicking the Settings link and then clicking Miscellaneous. In the 
Image Sizes section, designate your desired height and width of the 
small and medium thumbnail images generated by WordPress.
 
Figure 9-2: 
You can 
set several 
options for 
your images 
after you 
upload 
them.
 

197
 Chapter 9: Media Management: Images, Audio, and Video
 
 If you’re uploading more than one image, skip to the “Inserting a photo 
gallery” section, later in this chapter.
 
4. Click the Insert into Post button.
 
 The image uploader window closes, and you return to the Add New Post 
page (or the Add New Page page, if you’re writing a page). WordPress 
has inserted the HTML to display the image in your post, as shown in 
Figure 9-3; you can continue editing your post, save it, or publish it.
 
To see the actual image and not the code, click the Visual tab that’s just above 
the Post text box.
Aligning your images
When you upload your image, you can set the alignment for your image as 
None, Left, Center, or Right. The WordPress theme you’re using, however, 
may not have these alignment styles accounted for in its stylesheet. If you 
set the alignment to Left, for example, but the image on your blog doesn’t 
appear to be aligned at all, you may need to add a few styles to your theme’s 
stylesheet.
 
Figure 9-3: 
WordPress 
inserts the 
correct 
HTML code 
for your

198
Part IV: Flexing and Extending WordPress 
I discuss themes and templates in great detail in Part V. For purposes of 
making sure that you have the correct image alignment for your newly 
uploaded images, however, here is a quick-and-dirty method:
 
1. Click the Editor link in the Appearance menu.
 
 The Edit Themes page opens. All the template files for your active theme 
are listed on the right side of the page.
 
2. Click the Stylesheet template.
 
 The Stylesheet (style.css) template opens in the text box on the left 
side of the page.
 
3. Add your desired styles to the stylesheet.
Table 9-1 shows the styles you can add to your stylesheet to make sure that 
image-alignment styling is present and accounted for in your theme.
Table 9-1 
Styling Techniques for Image Alignment
Image Alignment
Add This to Your Stylesheet (style.css)
None
img.alignnone {float:none; margin: 
5px 0 5px 0;}
Left
img.alignleft {float:left; margin: 
5px 10px 5px 0px;}
Center
img.aligncenter {display:block; 
float:none; margin: 5px auto;}
Right
img.alignright {float:right; margin: 
5px 0 5px 10px;}
These styles are just examples of what you can do. Get creative with your 
own styling. You find more information about using CSS (Cascading Style 
Sheets) to add style to your theme(s) in Chapter 13.
Inserting a photo gallery
You can also use the WordPress image uploader to insert a full photo gallery 
into your posts. Upload your images; then, instead of clicking the Insert into 
Post button, click the Gallery tab at the top of the image uploader window 
(refer to Figure 9-1). This tab displays thumbnails of all the images you have 
uploaded for your post. Figure 9-4 shows that I have three images uploaded.

199
 Chapter 9: Media Management: Images, Audio, and Video
 
Figure 9-4: 
The Gallery 
tab of the 
image 
uploader.
 
Follow these steps to insert a photo gallery into a blog post:
 
1. (Optional) On the Gallery tab, under the Options column, type the 
order that you want the images to appear in the gallery.
 
 Type the number of the sequence in which you want this image dis-
played. (If you want this image displayed first, for example, type the 
number 1.)
 
2. Set different options for your gallery:
 
• Link Thumbnails To: Select Image File or Attachment Page.
 
• Order Images By: Select Menu Order, Name, or Date/Time.
 
• Order: Select Ascending or Descending.
 
• Gallery Columns: Select how many columns of images you’d like to 
display in your gallery.
 
3. Click the Save All Changes button.
 
 All the changes you made to each individual image listed in the gallery 
are saved.
 
4. Click the Insert Gallery button.
 
 WordPress inserts into your post a piece of short code that looks like 
this: [gallery].

200
Part IV: Flexing and Extending WordPress 
 
 Table 9-2 shows some gallery short codes that you can use to manually 
set the display settings for your photo gallery.
 
5. (Optional) Change the order of appearance of the images in the gal-
lery, as well as the markup (HTML tags or CSS selectors):
 
• captiontag: Change the markup that surrounds the image cap-
tion by altering the gallery short code. Here are some examples: 
[gallery captiontag=”div”] places <div></div> tags 
around the image caption (the <div> tag is considered a block 
level element and creates a separate container for the content); 
to have the gallery appear on a line of its own, the [gallery 
captiontag=”p”] code places <p class=”gallery-
caption”></p> tags around the image caption. The default 
markup for the captiontag option is dd.
 
• icontag: Defines the HTML markup around each individual 
thumbnail image in your gallery. Change the markup around the 
icontag (thumbnail icon) of the image by altering the gallery 
short code to something like [gallery icontag=”p”], which 
places <p class=”gallery-icon”></p> tags around each 
thumbnail icon. The default markup for icontag is dt.
 
• itemtag: Defines the HTML markup around each item in your 
gallery. Change the markup around the itemtag (each item) 
in the gallery by altering the gallery short code to something 
like [gallery itemtag=”span”], which places <span 
class=”gallery-item”></span> tags around each item in the 
gallery. The default markup for the itemtag is dl.
 
• captiontag: Define the HTML markup around the image cap-
tion for each image in your gallery. Change the markup around 
the captiontag (caption) for each image by altering the gallery 
short code to something like [gallery captiontag=”p”], 
which places <p></p> tags around the image caption. The default 
markup for captiontag is dd.
 
• orderby: Defines the order that the images are displayed within 
your gallery. Change the order used to display the thumbnails in 
the gallery by altering the gallery short code to something like 
[gallery orderby=”menu_order ASC”], which displays the 
thumbnails in ascending menu order. Another parameter you can 
use is ID_order ASC, which displays the thumbnails in ascending 
order according to their IDs.

201
 Chapter 9: Media Management: Images, Audio, and Video
Table 9-2 
Gallery Short Code Examples
Gallery Short Code
Output
[gallery columns=”4” 
size=”medium”]
A four-column gallery containing medium-size 
images
[gallery col-
umns=”10” id=”215” 
size=”thumbnail”] 
A ten-column gallery containing thumbnail 
images pulled from the blog post with the ID 215.
[gallery 
captiontag=”p” 
icontag=”span”]
A three-column (default) gallery in which each 
image is surrounded by <span></span> tags 
and the image caption is surrounded by <p></
p> tags.
 
6. Define the style of the <span> tags in your CSS stylesheet.
 
 The <span> tags create an inline element; an element contained within 
a <span> tag stays on the same line as the element before it; there is no 
line break. You need a little knowledge of CSS to alter the <span> tags. 
Click the Design tab in your WordPress Administration panel, and then 
click the Theme Editor subtab to edit the stylesheet for your theme. 
Here’s an example of what you can add to the stylesheet (style.css) 
for your current theme:
span.gallery-icon img {
padding: 3px;
background: white;
border: 1px solid black;
margin: 0 5px;
}
 
 Placing this bit of CSS in the stylesheet (style.css) of your active 
theme automatically places a 1-pixel black border around each thumb-
nail, with 3 pixels of padding and a white background. The left and right 
margins are 5 pixels wide, creating nice spacing between images in the 
gallery.

Some great WordPress plugins work in tandem with the WordPress gallery 
feature. Check out Chapter 10 for information on how to install and use 
WordPress plugins in your blog.
Inserting Video Files into Your Blog Posts
Whether you’re producing your own videos for publication or want to embed 
other people’s videos that you find interesting, placing a video file in a blog 
post has never been easier with WordPress.
 
Check out a good example of a video blog at http://1938media.com. Loren 
Feldman and his team produce video for the Web and for mobile devices.
Several video galleries on the Web today allow you to add videos to blog 
posts; Google’s YouTube service (http://youtube.com) is a good example 
of this. To add video from the Web, click the Add Video icon, then click the 
From URL tab and follow these steps:
 
1. Type the URL (Internet address) of the video in the Video URL text box.
 
 Type the full URL, including the http and www portion of the address. 
Video providers, such as YouTube, usually list the direct link for the 
video file on their sites; you can copy and paste it into the Video URL 
text box.
 
2. (Optional) Type the title of the video in the Title text box.
 
 Giving a title to the video allows you to provide a bit of a description of 
the video. It’s a good idea to provide a title if you can, so that your read-
ers know what the video is about.
 
3. Click the Insert into Post button.
 
 A link to the video is inserted into your post. WordPress doesn’t embed 
the actual video in the post; it inserts only a link to the video. Your 
blog visitors click the link to load another page where the video can be 
played.
To upload a video file from your own computer and post it to your blog, click 
the Add Video icon on the Edit Post or Add New Post page, and follow these 
steps to upload and link a video file in your blog post:
 
1. Click the Choose Files to Upload button.
 
 An Open dialog box opens.

204
Part IV: Flexing and Extending WordPress 
 
2. Select the video file you want to upload, and click Open (or double-
click the file).
 
 You return to the file uploader window in WordPress, which shows a 
progress bar while your video uploads. When the upload is complete, a 
box containing several options drops down.
 
3. Type a title for the file in the Title text box.
 
4. Type a caption for the file in the Caption text box.
 
5. Type a description of the file in the Description text box.
 
6. Click the File URL button.
 
 It provides a direct link in your post to the video file itself.
 
7. Click Insert into Post.
 
 A link to the video is inserted into your post. WordPress doesn’t embed 
a video player in the post; it inserts only a link to the video. Your blog 
visitors click the link to load another page where the video can be 
played.
Some great WordPress plugins for video handling can enhance the function-
ality of the file uploader and help you with video display in your blog posts. 
Check out Chapter 10 for information on how to install and use WordPress 
plugins in your blog.

Inserting Audio Files into Your Blog Posts
Audio files can be music files or a recording of you speaking to your readers; 
it adds a nice personal touch to your blog, and you can easily share audio 
files on your blog through the use of the Upload Audio feature in WordPress. 
After you’ve inserted an audio file in your blog posts, your readers can listen 
to it on their computers or download it onto an MP3 player and listen to it on 
their drives to work, if they want to.
Click the Add Audio icon on the Edit Post or Add New Post page, and follow 
these steps to upload an audio file to your blog post:
 
1. Click the Choose Files to Upload button.
 
 An Open dialog box opens.
 
2. Choose the file you want to upload, and click Open (or double-click 
the file).
 
 You return to the file uploader window in WordPress, which shows a 
progress bar while your audio file uploads. When the upload is com-
plete, a box containing several options drops down.
 
3. Type a title for the file in the Title text box.
 
4. Type a caption for the file in the Caption text box.
 
5. Type a description of the file in the Description text box.
 
6. Click the File URL button.
 
 You can provide a direct link in your post to the video file itself.
 
7. Click Insert into Post.
 
 A link to the audio file is inserted into your post. WordPress doesn’t 
embed an actual audio player in the post; it only inserts a link to the 
audio file. Visitors click the link to open another page where the audio 
file can be played.
Some great WordPress plugins for audio handling can enhance the functional-
ity of the file uploader and help you manage audio files in your blog posts.

Keeping Media Files Organized
If you’ve been running your blog for any length of time, you can easily forget 
what files you’ve uploaded with the WordPress uploader. I used to have to 
log in to my Web server via FTP and view the uploads directory to see what I 
had in there.
Now, the WordPress Media Library makes it very convenient and easy to dis-
cover which files are in your uploads folder.
To find an image, video, or audio file that you’ve already uploaded using the 
file uploader and use that file in a new post, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Upload Media icon to open the file uploader window.
 
2. Click the Media Library link at the top.
 
 You see all the files you’ve ever uploaded to your blog with the file 
uploader feature (see Figure 9-6). Files you’ve uploaded through other 
methods, like FTP, are not displayed in the Media Library.
 
3. Select the file you want to reuse, and click the Show link.
 
4. Set the options for that image: Title, Caption, Description, Link URL, 
Order, Alignment, and Size.
 
5. Click the Insert into Post button.
 
 The correct HTML code is inserted into the Post text box. 
WordPress audio plugins
Here are a handful of great plugins:
 ✓ Audio Player by Martin Laine: This plugin 
makes it easy to embed a nice Flash MP3 
player in your blog posts. No special HTML 
or programming knowledge is needed. You 
can download the plugin at http://
wordpress.org/extend/plugins/
audio-player.
 ✓ 1 Bit Audio Player by Mark Wheeler: 
This easy Flash MP3 player autodetects 
MP3 files on your site and inserts a stylish 
player so that your visitors can listen right 
from your blog page. You can download it at 
http://wordpress.org/extend/
plugins/1-bit-audio-player.
 ✓ Podcasting by Ronald Heft, Jr.: This plugin 
supports several media formats and inte-
grates into your WordPress uploading 
section. Also, it automatically creates a 
podcast RSS feed that your visitors can 
easily subscribe to. You can download this 
plugin at http://wordpress.org/
extend/plugins/podcasting.

Figure 9-6: 
The Media 
Library 
shows all 
the files 
you’ve ever 
uploaded to 
your blog.
 
If you only want to view the files you’ve uploaded and don’t need a particu-
lar image or file for a new post, click the Edit link in the Media menu, which 
opens the Media Library page.
The Media Library page lists all the files you’ve ever uploaded to your 
WordPress blog. By default, the page displays all types of files, but you can 
click the Images, Audio, or Video link to specify which file type you want to 
see (see Figure 9-7).
You can do the following tasks on the Media Library page:
 
✓ Filter media files by date. If you want to view all media files that were 
uploaded in October 2008, choose that date from the drop-down menu 
and click the Filter button; the page reloads and displays only the media 
files uploaded in the month of October 2008.
 
✓ Search media files using a specific keyword. If you want to search your 
Media Library for all files that reference kittens, then you type the word 
kittens in the Search box in the upper right side of the Media Library 
page. Then click the Search Media button; the page reloads and displays 
only media files that contain the keyword or tag of kittens.
 
✓ Delete media files. Click the small white box that appears to the left of 
every thumbnail on the Manage Media page; then click the Delete button 
that shows at the top left of the page. The page reloads, and the media 
file you’ve just deleted is now gone.

208

✓ View media files. On the Manage Media page, click the thumbnail of 
the file you’d like to view. The actual file opens in your Web browser. If 
necessary, you can copy the permalink of the file from your browser’s 
address bar.

H
alf the fun of running a WordPress-powered blog is playing with the 
hundreds of plugins that you can install to extend your blog’s func-
tions and options. WordPress plugins are like those really cool custom rims 
you put on your car: Although they don’t come with the car, they’re awesome 
accessories that make your car better than all the rest.
In this chapter, you find out what plugins are, how to find and install them, 
and how they enhance your blog in a way that makes your blog unique. Using 
plugins can also greatly improve your readers’ experiences by providing 
them various tools they can use to interact and participate — just the way 
you want them to!
This chapter assumes that you already have WordPress installed on your 
Web server. Installing plugins pertains only to the WordPress.org software. 
If you’re skipping around in the book and haven’t yet installed WordPress on 
your Web server, you can find instructions in Chapter 6.
 
WordPress.com users can’t install or configure plugins on their hosted blogs. I 
don’t make the rules, so please don’t kill the messenger.

210
Part IV: Flexing and Extending WordPress 
Finding Out What Plugins Are
A plugin is a small program that, when added to WordPress, interacts with 
the software to provide some extensibility to the software. Plugins aren’t part 
of the core software; they aren’t software programs either. They typically 
don’t function as stand-alone software. They do require the host program 
(WordPress, in this case) to function.
Plugin developers are the people who write these gems and share them with 
the rest of us — usually, for free. Like WordPress, plugins are free to anyone 
who wants to further tailor and customize his site to his own needs.
Although plugins are written and developed by people who have the set of 
skills required to do so, I would say that the WordPress user community is 
also largely responsible for the ongoing development of plugins. Ultimately, 
the end users are the ones who put those plugins to the true test of the real 
world in their own blogs. Those same users are also the first to speak up 
and let the developers know when something isn’t working right, helping the 
developers troubleshoot and fine-tune their plugins. The most popular plu-
gins are created by developers who encourage open communication with the 
user base. Overall, WordPress is one of those great open source projects in 
which the relationship between developers and users fosters a creative envi-
ronment that keeps the project fresh and exciting every step of the way.
Literally thousands of plugins are available for WordPress — certainly way 
too many for me to list in this chapter alone. I could, but then you’d need 
heavy machinery to lift this book off the shelf! So here are just a few exam-
ples of things that plugins let you add to your WordPress blog:
 
✓ E-mail notification: Your biggest fans can sign up to have an e-mail noti-
fication sent to them every time you update your blog.
 
✓ Submit your blog to social networking services: Allow your readers to 
submit your blog posts to some of the most popular social networking 
services, such as Digg, Technorati, and Del.icio.us.
 
✓ Stats program: Keep track of where your traffic is coming from; which 
posts on your blog are the most popular; and how much traffic is 
coming through your blog on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis.
Chapter 17 gives you a peek at some of the most popular plugins on the 
scene today. In the meantime, this chapter takes you through the process of 
finding plugins, installing them in your WordPress blog, and managing and 
troubleshooting them.

211
 Chapter 10: Making the Most of WordPress Plugins
Exploring Manage Plugin page
Before you start installing plugins for your blog, it’s important for you to 
explore the Manage Plugins page in your WordPress Administration panel 
and understand how to manage the plugins after you install them. Click the 
Installed link in the Plugins menu to get to the Manage Plugins page (shown 
in Figure 10-1).
 
Figure 10-1: 
The Manage 
Plugins 
page in the 
WordPress 
Admin-
istration 
panel.
 
The Manage Plugins page is where you manage all the plugins you install in 
your WordPress blog. This page is laid out in two sections:
 
✓ Currently Active Plugins: These plugins, listed at the top of the Plugin 
Management page, are currently being used on your site. Figure 10-1 
shows that I have one active plugin, Akismet.
 
✓ Inactive Plugins: These plugins are not in active use on your blog. These 
plugins exist in the plugins directory on your Web server, but because 
you have not activated them, they are listed as available rather than 
active.

212
Part IV: Flexing and Extending WordPress 
When you don’t want to use a plugin anymore, click the Deactivate link to the 
right of the plugin; the plugin moves to the Inactive Plugins section, indicat-
ing that it’s installed on your blog but not activated. Likewise, to activate a 
plugin, click the Activate link to the right of the plugin (the Hello Dolly plugin 
in Figure 10-1, for example); the plugin then moves to the Currently Active 
Plugins list, indicating that it’s installed and activated.
 
You can mass manage your plugins on the Manage Plugins page. In the 
Currently Active Plugins section, you can deactivate all your plugins at once 
by selecting the box to the left of each plugin name, and then clicking the 
Deactivate button. Likewise, you can activate or delete the plugins listed in 
the Active Plugins box by selecting the box to the left of each plugin name, 
and then clicking the Activate or the Delete button (depending on which 
action you wish to take). To select all your plugins with one click in either the 
Currently Active or the Inactive Plugins box, select the box to the left of the 
Plugin heading.
The Manage Plugins page displays plugins in four columns, which give details 
for each plugin:
 
✓ Plugin: This column lists the plugin name so that you can find it easily 
when browsing the Plugin Management page. Usually, the name of the 
plugin is also linked to the plugin author’s Web site or a page where you 
can find additional information and details about the plugin.
 
✓ Version: This column lists the version number of the plugin. Sometimes, 
a plugin author releases an update and changes the version number on 
the plugin Web site. WordPress alerts you when a new version is available 
(see “Discovering the one-click plugin upgrade,” later in this chapter).
 
✓ Description: This column lists a description for the plugin. Sometimes, 
depending on the plugin, it also gives you some brief instructions on 
using the plugin.
 
✓ Action: This column has two links. If you’re looking at an active plugin, the 
links that appear in the Action column are Deactivate and Edit. You can 
click the Deactivate link to deactivate the plugin or click the Edit link to edit 
the plugin file. If you’re looking at an available plugin, the links that appear 
in the Action column are Activate and Edit. You can click the Activate link 
to activate the plugin or click the Edit link to edit the plugin file.
Discovering the one-click plugin upgrade
For a lot of reasons, mainly security reasons, you really want to make sure 
that you always use the most up-to-date versions of the plugins in your blog. 
With everything you have to do every day, how can you possibly keep up 
with knowing whether the plugins you’re using have been updated?

213
 Chapter 10: Making the Most of WordPress Plugins
You don’t have to. WordPress does it for you.
Figure 10-2 shows an out-of-date version (1.15) of Akismet installed and acti-
vated. WordPress displays a message below the plugin description, notifying 
you that a new plugin is available.
 
Figure 10-2: 
WordPress 
tells you 
when a 
new plugin 
version is 
available.
 
WordPress not only gives you a message that a new version of the plugin is 
available, but also gives you a link to a page where you can download the 
new version or a link that you can click to upgrade the plugin right there and 
then — WordPress’s one-click plugin upgrade.
Click the Upgrade Automatically link, and WordPress grabs the new files off 
the WordPress.org server, uploads them to your plugins directory, deletes 
the old plugin, and activates the new one. Figure 10-3 shows the Upgrade 
Plugin page that displays while the plugin is being upgraded.
 
WordPress notifies you of an out-of-date plugin and provides you with the one-
click upgrade function only for plugins that are in the official WordPress Plugin 
Directory (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins). If a plugin you are 
using is not listed in the directory, then the notification and one-click upgrade 
function won’t be present for that plugin.
 
Another way that WordPress alerts you that you have out-of-date plugins is 
in the left navigation menu. When you have an out-of-date plugin, a number 
appears next to the Plugins menu, indicating that you have a plugin, or plu-
gins, that need to be upgraded. Figure 10-4 shows my Administration panel 
telling me that I have one plugin that needs to be upgraded. After you upgrade 
the plugin, the number disappears.
 
For the automatic plugin upgrade to work, your plugin directory (/wp-
content/plugins) must be writable on your Web server, which means that 
you should have set permissions of 755 or 777 (depending on your Web-server 
configuration). See Chapter 6 for information about changing file permissions 
on your Web server, or contact your Web hosting provider for assistance.

 Chapter 10: Making the Most of WordPress Plugins
Getting the Most out of the Plugins 
Included with WordPress
At this writing, WordPress packages two plugins with the installation files:
 
✓ Akismet: This plugin is essential.
 
✓ Hello Dolly: This plugin isn’t necessary to make your blog run smoothly, 
but it adds some extra fun.
Akismet
I touch on Akismet a few times throughout this book. Why so much? It’s 
my humble opinion that Akismet is the mother of all plugins and that no 
WordPress blog is complete without a fully activated version of Akismet.
Apparently WordPress agrees, because the plugin has been packaged in every 
WordPress software release since version 2.0. Akismet was created by the folks 
at Automattic — the same folks who bring you the Sidebar Widgets plugin. 
Akismet is the answer to comment and trackback spam. Matt Mullenweg 
of Automattic says Akismet is a “collaborative effort to make comment and 
trackback spam a non-issue and restore innocence to blogging, so you never 
have to worry about spam again” (from the Akismet Web site at http://
akismet.com).
To use the plugin, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Manage Plugins page, click the Activate link to the right of the 
Akismet plugin name and description.
 
 A yellow box appears at the top of the page, saying: “Akismet is almost 
ready. You must enter your WordPress.com API key for it to work” (see 
Figure 10-5). An API key is a string of numbers and letters and functions 
like a unique password given to you by WordPress.com; it’s the key 
that allows your WordPress.org application to communicate with your 
WordPress.com account.
 
2. Click the link in the yellow box to obtain your WordPress.com API key.
 
 Clicking this link takes you the WordPress.com Web site. If you have an 
account already, log in to it. If you don’t have an account on WordPress.
com, you need to create a WordPress.com account to get an API key. 
(See Chapter 3 to find out how to create your own WordPress.com 
account.) Although you have to create a WordPress.com account, you 
don’t need to use it; you just need to get the API key.

216
Part IV: Flexing and Extending WordPress 
 
Figure 10-5: 
After you 
activate 
Akismet, 
WordPress 
tells you 
that the 
plugin isn’t 
quite ready 
to use yet.
 
 
3. Log into your WordPress.com account, click the Users link in the top 
right corner, and then click the Your Profile subtab to view the Your 
Profile and Personal Options page.
 
 You find your WordPress.com API key at the top of that page, as shown 
in Figure 10-6. (I have blacked out my own API key because — shhhh — 
it’s a secret, and I’m not supposed to share it!)
 
4. When you have your API key, go to the Akismet Configuration page 
by clicking the Akismet Configuration link in the Plugins menu in 
your WordPress Administration panel.
 
5. Enter the API key in the WordPress.com API Key box, and click the 
Update Options button to fully activate the Akismet plugin.
Akismet catches spam and throws it into a queue, holding the spam for 15 
days and then deleting it from your database. It’s probably worth your while 
to check the Akismet Spam page once a week to make sure that the plugin 
hasn’t captured any legitimate comments or trackbacks.

217
 Chapter 10: Making the Most of WordPress Plugins
 
Figure 10-6: 
You can 
find your 
WordPress 
API key on 
the Your 
Profile and 
Personal 
Options 
page in 
the Admin-
istration 
panel.
 
You can rescue those nonspam captured comments and trackbacks by doing 
the following (after you’ve logged in to your WordPress Administration panel):
 
1. Click the Comments menu.
 
 The Edit Comments page appears, displaying a list of the most recent 
comments on your blog.
 
2. Click the Spam link.
 
 The Edit Comments page now displays all spam comments that the 
plugin caught.
 
3. Browse through the list of spam comments, looking for any comments 
or trackbacks that are legitimate.
 
4. If you locate one that’s legitimate, select the Approve link box directly 
underneath the entry.
 
 The comment is marked as legitimate. In other words, you don’t con-
sider this comment to be spam. The comment is then approved and 
published on your blog.

218
Part IV: Flexing and Extending WordPress 
 
Check your spam filter often. I just found four legitimate comments caught in 
my spam filter and was able to de-spam them, releasing them from the binds 
of Akismet and unleashing them upon the world.
The folks at Automattic did a fine thing with Akismet. Since the emergence of 
Akismet, I’ve barely had to think about comment or trackback spam, except 
for the few times a month I check my Akismet spam queue.
Hello Dolly
Matt Mullenweg, co-founder of WordPress, developed the Hello Dolly plugin. 
Anyone who follows the development of WordPress knows that he is a huge 
jazz fan. How do we know this? Every single release of WordPress is named 
after some jazz great. One of the most recent releases of the software, for 
example, is named Ella — after jazz great Ella Fitzgerald.
So, knowing this, it isn’t surprising that Mullenweg developed a plugin 
named Hello Dolly. Here’s the description of it that you see in the Plugin 
Management page in your Administration panel:
This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an 
entire generation summed up in two words sung most famously by Louis 
Armstrong: Hello, Dolly. When activated you will randomly see a lyric 
from Hello, Dolly in the upper right of your admin screen on every page.
Is it necessary? No. Is it fun? Sure!
Activate the Hello Dolly plugin on the Manage Plugins page in your 
WordPress Administration panel. When you’ve activated it, your WordPress 
blog greets you with a different lyric from the song “Hello, Dolly!” each time.
If you want to change the lyrics in this plugin, you can edit them by clicking 
the Edit link to the right of the Hello Dolly plugin on the Manage Plugins page. 
The Plugin Editor opens and lets you edit the file in a text editor. Make sure 
that each line of the lyric has its own line in the plugin file.
Using Plugins: Just the Basics
In this section, I show you how to install a plugin in your WordPress blog, 
using the built-in plugins feature. The auto-installation of plugins from 
within your WordPress administration panel only works for plugins that are 
included in the official WordPress Plugin Directory. You can manually install 
plugins on your WordPress blog, which I cover in the next section.

219
 Chapter 10: Making the Most of WordPress Plugins
WordPress makes it super easy to find, install, and then activate plugins for 
use on your blog. — just follow these simple steps:
 
1. Click the Add New link in the Plugins menu.
 
 The Install Plugins page opens where you can browse the official 
WordPress Plugins Directory from your WordPress Administration 
panel.
 
2. Select a plugin to install on your blog:
 
• Term: If you want to search for plugins that allow you to add addi-
tional features for comments on your site, select Term in the drop-
down menu and then enter the word Comments in the Search text 
box on the Install Plugins page. Click the Search button and a list of 
plugins returns that deal specifically with comments.
 
• Author or Tag: Select Author or Tag in the drop-down menu and 
then enter the author or tag name in the Search box and click the 
Search button.
 
 You can also search by tag by clicking any of the tag names that appear 
at the bottom of the Install Plugins page under the Popular Tags heading.
 
 I want to install of a very popular plugin called Subscribe to Comments 
(see the next section in this chapter for a description of this plugin). 
Enter the words Subscribe to Comments in the Search text box on the 
Install Plugins page.
 
 Figure 10-7 shows the results page for the Subscribe to Comments, 
which is listed as the sixth plugin.
 
3. Click the Install link in the Actions column of the Subscribe to 
Comments plugin listing.
 
 A Plugin Information window opens, giving you information about the 
Subscribe to Comments plugin, including a description of the plugin, 
version number, author name, and an Install Now button.
 
4. Click the Install Now button.
 
 You go to the Install Plugins page in your WordPress Administration 
panel, where you find a confirmation message that the plugin has been 
downloaded, unpacked, and successfully installed.
 
5. Specify whether to install the plugin or proceed to the Plugins page.
 
 Two links are shown under the confirmation message:
 
• Activate Plugin: Click this link to activate the plugin you just 
installed on your blog.
 
• Return to Plugins page: Click this link to go to the Manage 
Plugins page.

The auto-installation of plugins from your WordPress Administration panel 
works on most Web-hosting configurations. However, some Web hosting 
services don’t allow the kind of access that the WordPress Plugin Directory 
needs to complete the auto-installation. If you get any errors, or find that you 
are unable to use the plugin auto-installation feature, I recommend getting in 
touch with your Web hosting provider to find out if they can assist you.
Installing Plugins Manually
In the following sections, I show you how to find, upload, and install the 
very popular Subscribe to Comments plugin, developed by Mark Jaquith. I’m 
using the Subscribe to Comments plugin as a real-world example to take you 
through the mechanics involved in downloading, unpacking, uploading, acti-
vating, and using a plugin in WordPress.

221
 Chapter 10: Making the Most of WordPress Plugins
Subscribe to Comments gives your readers the opportunity to subscribe to 
individual comment threads on your site so that they receive a notification, 
via e-mail, when a new comment has been left on the comment thread (or 
blog post) that they have chosen to subscribe to. This plugin helps keep 
lively discussions active in your blog.
 
Installing the Subscribe to Comments plugin takes you through the process, 
but keep in mind that every plugin is different. Reading the description and 
installation instructions for each plugin you want to install is very important.
Finding and downloading the files
The first step in using plugins is locating the one you want to install. Table 
10-2 outlines the reliable places you can find plugins.

Some rather unscrupulous sites offer WordPress plugins for download, but 
you may find that you’re also downloading some not-so-nice additional files, 
such as viruses, malware, and spyware. Stick with the tried-and true-sites 
listed in Table 10-2, and you’ll be safe.
To find Mark Jaquith’s Subscribe to Comments plugin, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the official WordPress Plugin Directory, located at http://
wordpress.org/extend/plugins.
 
 The home page opens; see Figure 10-8.
 
2. In the search box at the top of the page, enter the keywords Subscribe 
to Comments and then click the Search Plugins button.

Figure 10-8:

the plugin 
you need.
 
 
3. Locate the Subscribe to Comments plugin on the search results page, 
and click the plugin name.
 
 The Subscribe to Comments page opens in the WordPress Plugin 
Directory, where you find a description of the plugin, as well as other 
information about the plugin (see Figure 10-9). For example, take note of 
the important information in the FYI box:
 
• Version: The number shown in this area is the most recent version 
of the plugin.
 
• Other Versions: This link takes you to a page that displays all the 
previous versions of the plugin. This is helpful if you have to revert 
to an older version of the plugin if the new version fails on your 
individual WordPress installation.
 
• Last Updated: This displays the date that the plugin was last 
updated by the author.
 
• Requires WordPress Version: This tells you what version of 
WordPress you need to successfully use this plugin. For example, 
Figure 10-9 shows that the Subscribe to Comments plugin requires 
WordPress version 2.0.6 or higher; that means that this plugin 
doesn’t work with versions lower than 2.0.6. Helpful!

223
 Chapter 10: Making the Most of WordPress Plugins
 
Figure 10-9: 
The down-

for the

plugin.
 
 
• Compatible Up To: This tells you what version of WordPress this 
plugin is compatible up to. For example, if this section tells you the 
plugin is compatible up to version 2.3 — that means you can’t use 
the plugin with versions higher than 2.3. I say usually because the 
plugin developer may not update the information in this section — 
especially if there have been no changes to the plugin files them-
selves. The best way to check is to download the plugin and install it 
and see if it works! (Figure 10-9 shows that Mark Jaquith’s Subscribe 
to Comments plugin is compatible up to WordPress version 2.3.1 — 
however, I can verify that it does work in all versions up to the most 
recent, 2.6.1.)
 
• Author Homepage: This link takes you to the plugin author’s main 
Web site.
 
• Plugin Homepage: This link takes you to the specific Web site for 
the plugin. Often, this is a page within the plugin author’s Web site.
 
4. Click the Download button to download the files.
 
 If you’re using Internet Explorer, click the Download button, and a dialog 
box opens, asking whether you want to open or save the file. Click Save 
to save the zip file to your hard drive, and remember where you saved it.

224
Part IV: Flexing and Extending WordPress 
 
 If you’re using Mozilla Firefox, click the Download button, and a dialog 
box opens, asking what Firefox should do with the file. Select the Save 
File radio button and then click OK to save it to your hard drive. Again, 
remember where you saved it.
 
 For other browsers, follow the download instructions in the correspond-
ing dialog box.
 
5. Locate the file on your hard drive, and open it with your favorite 
decompression program.
 
 If you’re unsure how to use a decompression program, refer to the docu-
mentation available with the program.
 
6. Unpack the plugin files you downloaded for the Subscribe to 
Comments plugin.
Reading the instructions
Frequently, the plugin developer includes a readme file inside the zip file. Do 
what the title of the file says: Read it. Many times, it contains the exact docu-
mentation and instructions that you will find on the plugin developer’s page.
Make sure that you read the instructions carefully and follow them correctly. 
Ninety-nine percent of WordPress plugins have great documentation and 
instructions from the plugin developer. If you don’t follow the instructions 
correctly, at best, the plugin just won’t work on your blog. At worst, the plugin 
creates all sorts of ugly errors, requiring you to start over from step one.
 
You can open readme.txt files in any text-editor program, such as Notepad 
or WordPad on a PC, or TextEdit on a Mac.
In the case of Mark Jaquith’s Subscribe to Comments plugin, the readme.
txt file contains instructions on how to upload and use the plugin, as well as 
some answers to frequently asked questions on troubleshooting the installa-
tion and use.
 
Every plugin is different in terms of where the plugin files are uploaded and 
in terms of the configurations and setup necessary to make the plugin work 
on your site. Read the installation instructions very carefully and follow those 
instructions to the letter to install the plugin correctly on your site.

225
 Chapter 10: Making the Most of WordPress Plugins
Uploading and Activating Plugins
Now you’re ready to upload the plugin files to your Web server. Connect to 
your Web server via FTP. Locate the plugin files you just unpacked on your 
hard drive. In the event that the plugin developer didn’t include a readme.
txt file with instructions, check the plugin developer’s page for specific 
instructions on how to install the plugin in your WordPress blog. Specifically, 
the documentation in the readme.txt file and/or on the plugin’s Web site 
should address the following points:
 
✓ What directory on your Web server you upload the plugin files to.
 
✓ What to do if you need to change permissions for any of the plugin files 
after you upload them to your Web server. (See Chapter 6 if you need 
information on changing file permissions.)
 
✓ What to do if you need to set specific configurations in the plugin file to 
make it work.
 
✓ What to do if you need to modify your theme template files to include 
the plugin’s functions in your blog.
Uploading the files
Mark Jaquith left some nice instructions for you in the plugin zip file. Look for 
the readme.txt file inside the zip files you download from his site.
To install the Subscribe to Comments plugin, follow these easy steps:
 
1. Double-click the subscribe-to-comments folder in the files you 
downloaded and unpacked on your computer.
 
 A folder opens, containing two files: subscribe-to-comments.php 
and readme.txt. (You also see another folder called extras. This 
folder contains the plugin installation instructions in two additional 
formats: HTML [readme.html] and Microsoft PowerPoint 
[subscribe-to-comments.pot].)
 
 Figure 10-10 shows all the files and folders contained in the Subscribe to 
Comments plugin.
 
2. Close the folder after you’ve determined that it contains all the neces-
sary files.

226
Part IV: Flexing and Extending WordPress 
 
3. Connect to your Web server via FTP, and open the /wp-content/
plugins/ folder.
 
 This folder contains all the plugins that are currently installed in your 
WordPress blog.
 
4. Upload the entire subscribe-to-comments folder into the /wp-
content/plugins/ folder on your Web server.
 
 Figure 10-11 shows the plugin files and where they should be located on 
your Web server. Note: The plugins on my Web server may differ from 
the ones you’ve chosen to install on yours; however, you can see where 
I placed the subscribe-to-comments folder.

Activating the plugin
When you have the plugin files uploaded to the correct location on your Web 
server, open your browser, and log in to your WordPress Administration 
panel. After you log in, head to the Manage Plugins page to activate the 
Subscribe to Comments plugin:
 
1. Click the Installed link on the Plugins menu.
 
 The Mange Plugins page opens, listing all the plugins installed in your 
WordPress blog.

2. Locate the Subscribe to Comments plugin.
 
 Because you have not activated this plugin, it’s located in the Inactive 
Plugins section at the bottom of the Manage Plugins page.
 
3. Click the Activate link to the right of the plugin name.
 
 The Manage Plugins page refreshes, and the Subscribe to Comments plugin 
is now listed in the Currently Active Plugins section at the top of the page.
If you’ve followed all these steps in your own blog, congratulations — you 
now have Subscribe to Comments installed. Great job!
Setting Plugin Options
Some, but not all, WordPress plugins provide an administration page where 
you can set options that are specific to that particular plugin. You can find 
the plugin administration page in any of these places:
 
✓ The Settings page (click the Settings menu)
 
✓ The Tools menu (located in the navigation menu)
 
✓ The Plugins menu (located in the navigation menu)
You can find the Subscribe to Comments plugin administration page by click-
ing the Subscribe to Comments link in the Settings menu. The Subscribe to 
Comments Options page opens (see Figure 10-12).

Uninstalling Plugins
After all this talk about installing and activating plugins, what happens if 
you install and activate a plugin, and then at some point decide that it just 
isn’t what you want? Don’t worry — you aren’t stuck forever with a plugin 
that you don’t want. WordPress lets you be fickle and finicky in your plugin 
choices!
To uninstall a plugin from your WordPress blog:
 
1. Click the Installed link on the Plugins menu.
 
 The Manage Plugins page opens.
 
2. Locate the plugin you want to uninstall.
 
3. Click the Deactivate link to the right of the plugin name and description.
 
 The Manage Plugins page refreshes and shows the plugin now in the 
Inactive Plugins list.

229
 Chapter 10: Making the Most of WordPress Plugins
 
4. Select the plugin.
 
 Place a checkmark in the box to the left of the plugin name.
 
5. Select Delete and then click the Apply button.
 
 The Delete Plugin(s) page opens and a confirmation message displays 
asking you if you’re sure you want to delete this plugin. (See Figure 10-13.)
 
6. Click the Yes, Delete These Files button.
 
 The Manage Plugins page refreshes and the plugin you just deleted is 
gone from the lists of plugins.
Bang! You’re done. That’s all it takes.
 
Don’t forget to remove any bits of code that you needed to add to your theme 
templates for that particular plugin; otherwise, they’ll cause ugly error mes-
sages to display in your blog.

Part IV: Flexing and Extending WordPress 
Understanding the Open 
Source Environment
The WordPress software was built on an existing platform called b2. Matt 
Mullenweg, co-founder of WordPress, was using b2 as a blogging platform 
at the time the developer of that program abandoned it. What did this mean 
for its users? It meant no more development unless someone somewhere 
picked up the ball and continued with the platform. Enter Mullenweg and 
WordPress.
Apply this same concept to plugin development, and you’ll understand that 
plugins sometimes fall by the wayside and drop off the face of the Earth. 
Unless someone takes over when the original developer loses interest, future 
development of that plugin ceases. It’s important to understand that most 
plugins are developed in an open source environment, which means a few 
things for you, the end user:
 
✓ The developers who created your favorite plugin aren’t obligated to con-
tinue development. If they find a new hobby or simply tire of the work, 
they can give it up completely. If no one picks up where they left off, you 
can kiss that plugin goodbye if it doesn’t work with the latest WordPress 
release.
 
✓ Developers of popular plugins generally are extremely good about 
updating them when new versions of WordPress are released, or when a 
security bug or flaw is discovered. Keep in mind, however, that no time-
table exists for these developers to hold to. Many of these folks have 
day jobs, classes, or families that can keep them from devoting as much 
time to the project as you want them to.
 
✓ Beware of the pitfalls of falling in love with any particular WordPress 
plugin, because in the world of plugin development, it’s easy come, easy 
go. Try not to let your Web site become dependent on a plugin, and don’t 
be surprised if a plugin you love doesn’t exist tomorrow. You can use 
the plugin for as long as it continues to work for you, but when it stops 
working (such as with a new WordPress release or a security exploit that 
makes it unusable), you have a rough decision to make. You can
 
• Stop using the plugin, and try to find a suitable alternative.
 
• Hope that another developer takes over the project when the origi-
nal developer discontinues his involvement.
 
• Try to find someone to provide a fix for you (in which case, you’ll 
more than likely have to pay that someone for her time).
I don’t want to make the world of WordPress plugins sound like gloom and 
doom, but I do think it’s very important for you to understand the dynamics 
in play. Consider this section food for thought.

Finding and Installing 
WordPress Themes
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring safe versus unsafe WordPress themes
▶ Finding free WordPress themes
▶ Downloading, installing, and activating themes
▶ Finding, purchasing, and using premium themes
I
n previous chapters, I cover how to use the WordPress platform to pub-
lish your posts and pages. In those chapters, you discover how to cat-
egorize your posts, build your link lists, and set the publishing and profile 
options in the WordPress Administration panel. In this chapter, I focus on the 
visual look and format of your blog — in other words, how other people see 
your blog after you start publishing your content.
In Chapter 10, I introduce WordPress plugins and discuss some of the thou-
sands of free plugins you can use to add functionality to your blog. Similarly, 
thousands of free themes are available for you to download and use. This 
chapter shows you where to find them and takes you through the processes 
of downloading, installing, and using them.
Getting Started with Free Themes
WordPress comes packaged with two free themes for you to use. Most blog-
gers who use WordPress usually don’t waste any time at all in finding a theme 
that they like better than the Default or Classic WordPress theme. Those 
packaged themes (which you can find on the Design tab in your WordPress 
Administration panel) are meant to get you started; you’re not limited to 
using just those two themes. Although both themes are functional, they’re 
kind of plain.

234
Part IV: Flexing and Extending WordPress 
Free WordPress themes, such as those I discuss in Chapter 18, are popular 
because of their appealing designs and their ease of installation and use. 
They’re great tools to use when you launch your new blog, and if you dabble 
a bit in graphic design and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), you can custom-
ize one of the free WordPress themes to fit your own needs. (See Chapter 13 
for some resources and tools for templates and template tags, as well as a 
few great CSS references.) Also see the nearby sidebar “Are all WordPress 
themes free?” for information about free versus premium themes.
By using free themes, you can have your blog up and running with a new 
design — without the help of a professional — pretty fast. And with thou-
sands of themes available, you can change your theme as often as you want. 
Chapter 15 presents information on hiring blog professionals, if you decide 
later that you want a more customized theme for your blog.
Finding free themes
Finding the theme that fits you best may take some time, but with thousands 
available, you’ll eventually find one that suits you. Trying out several free 
themes is like trying on different “outfits” for your blog. You can change out-
fits as needed until you find just the right theme.
In July 2008, WordPress launched the official WordPress Theme Directory at 
http://wordpress.org/extend/themes (see Figure 11-1).
Are all WordPress themes free?
Not all WordPress themes are created equal, 
and it’s important for you, the user, to know the 
difference between free and premium themes:
 ✓ Free: These themes are free, period. You 
can download and use them on your Web 
site at absolutely no cost. It’s a courtesy to 
include a link to the designer in the footer of 
your blog — but you can even remove that 
link if you want to.
 ✓ Premium: These themes cost money. You 
usually find premium themes available for 
download only after you’ve paid anywhere 
from $10 to $500. The designer feels that 
these themes are a cut above the rest and, 
therefore, are worth the money you spend 
for them. Generally, you’re not allowed 
to remove any designer-credit links that 
appear in these themes, and you’re not 
allowed to redistribute the themes. (Note: 
You won’t find premium themes in the offi-
cial WordPress Theme Directory.) I pro-
vide information on where to find premium 
themes at the end of this chapter.

235
 Chapter 11: Finding and Installing WordPress Themes 
 
Figure 11-1: 
The 
WordPress 
Theme 
Directory.
 
 
The WordPress Theme Directory isn’t the only place on the Web to find free 
WordPress themes, but it’s the place to find the most functional and safe 
themes available. Safe themes contain clean code and basic WordPress func-
tions that are considered fundamental requirements in a theme to ensure 
that your WordPress blog functions with the minimum requirements. The 
WordPress.org Web site lists the basic requirements that theme designers 
have to meet before their theme is accepted into the themes directory; you 
can find that listing of requirements at http://wordpress.org/extend/
themes/about.
 
Unsafe themes, on the other hand, are developed by people who are looking 
to take advantage of the blog owners who use them. These particular themes 
are not allowed in the official WordPress Theme Directory. They contain ele-
ments such as the following:
 
✓ Spam links: These links usually appear in the footer of the theme and 
can link to some pretty unsavory places. The designers of these themes 
hope to benefit from traffic from your site. They count on the idea that 
most blog owners won’t notice the links or know how to remove them.

236
Part IV: Flexing and Extending WordPress 
 
✓ Malicious code: Unscrupulous theme designers can, and do, place code 
in theme files that inserts hidden malware and/or virus links and spam. 
Sometimes, you see a line or two of encrypted code that looks like it’s 
just part of the theme code, and unless you have a great deal of knowl-
edge of PHP, you may not know that the theme is infected with danger-
ous code.
The results of these unsafe theme elements can range from simply annoy-
ing to downright dangerous, affecting the integrity and security of your 
computer and/or hosting account. For this reason, the official WordPress 
Theme Directory is considered to be a safe place from which to download 
free themes. WordPress designers develop these themes and upload them 
to the theme directory, and each theme gets vetted by the folks behind the 
WordPress platform. In the official directory, themes that contain unsafe ele-
ments are simply not allowed to play.
 
My strong recommendation for finding free themes is to stick with the official 
WordPress Theme Directory. That way, you know you’re getting a clean, qual-
ity theme for your blog. You can rest assured that themes from the official 
directory are safe, and free of spam and malicious code.
Previewing themes
While you’re visiting the WordPress Theme Directory, you can easily browse 
the various themes by using the following features:
 
✓ Search: Type a keyword in the Search box at the top of the page (refer 
to Figure 11-1) and then click the Search Themes button. A new page 
opens, displaying themes related to the keyword you searched for.
 
✓ Featured Themes: These themes are listed in the center of the themes 
directory, randomly. WordPress changes the featured themes listing 
regularly.
 
✓ Popular Tags: This list consists of the themes that include the most 
popular tags. Themes are tagged with keywords that describe the theme 
features, such as 2 columns, 3 columns, blue, or white.
 
✓ Most Popular: These themes have been downloaded most often.
 
✓ Newest Themes: These themes are the latest to be added to the directory.
 
✓ Recently Updated: These themes have been updated most recently by 
their designers.
When you find a theme in the directory that you want to take a closer look at, 
click its name to open a page that describes that theme (see Figure 11-2):

237
 Chapter 11: Finding and Installing WordPress Themes 
 
✓ Download: Click this button to download the theme to your computer.
 
✓ Preview: Click this button to open a new window that shows what the 
theme looks like in a live blog.
Downloading themes
To download the theme you want, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Download button on the theme page (refer to Figure 11-2).
 
 The theme files are compressed in a .zip file.
 
2. Use your favorite decompression program to unpack the files to your 
own computer.
 
3. Connect to your Web server via FTP, and upload the entire theme 
folder to the /wp-content/themes/ directory of your Web server.
 
 The left side of Figure 11-3 shows that I saved the xMark theme files on 
my computer. The right side of Figure 11-3 shows that I uploaded the

server.

Activating a New Theme
When you have the theme uploaded to your Web server, you can activate it 
by logging in to your WordPress Administration panel and following these 
simple steps:
 
1. Click the Appearance menu.
 
 The Manage Themes page opens, listing all the themes currently 
installed in your themes directory. The active theme is shown in the 
Current Theme section at the top of the page. All available themes you 
may have uploaded to your Web server are shown in the Available 
Themes section (see Figure 11-4).
 
 Available themes appear on the Design tab in alphabetical order. If you 
have a lot of themes in your themes directory, they’re displayed ten on 
a page, with Next and Previous links to help you navigate all the themes 
available for your blog.
 
2. Click the name or thumbnail image of the theme you want to use.
 
 A preview window opens, showing you what your blog will look like with 
this new theme applied (see Figure 11-5).
 
 Click the X in the top-left corner of the preview window to close the 
theme without activating it.

239
 Chapter 11: Finding and Installing WordPress Themes 
 
3. Click the Activate Theme link.
 
 This link, located in the top-right corner of the preview window, is 
labeled with the theme name. Figure 11-5 shows an Activate WordPress 
Default link, because that’s the name of the theme I want to use.
 
 WordPress applies the theme you chose to your blog.

Using sidebar widgets
Most free WordPress themes come with built-
in code that lets you take advantage of sidebar 
widgets for your blog. WordPress widgets are 
wonderful! (Say that ten times fast, why don’t 
you?) Widgets are so wonderful because they 
let you arrange the display of content in your 
blog sidebar, such as your blogroll(s), recent 
posts, and monthly and category archive list-
ings. With widgets, you can accomplish this 
arranging without needing to know a single bit 
of code.
In Chapter 5, I cover how to use sidebar wid-
gets. Although that chapter pertains to the 
hosted WordPress.com platform, WordPress.
org users can follow the same steps. 
One difference for WordPress.org users is the 
use of plugins (see Chapter 10). Some plug-
ins have a built-in feature that enables you to 
include that plugin’s functions in your sidebar 
through the use of a widget. (WordPress.com 
doesn’t have this feature because it doesn’t 
allow uploading and activating various plugins.)

Deciding to Use Premium Themes
As WordPress becomes more and more popular, I’ve seen many different 
business models crop up around the Web that focus on providing WordPress 
users with premium services and support, such as custom design, consulting, 
and development, for example. (See Chapter 15 for information on hiring pro-
fessional services for your blog.)
Premium WordPress themes have become a very popular way for talented 
designers to provide a service they are very passionate about (designing 
themes) while making a little money for their efforts, at the same time. There 
are many schools of thought as to what makes a theme premium as opposed 
to a free theme. Actually, the topic of what is considered premium and what 
is not, in regards to WordPress themes, is guaranteed to spark passionate 
debate among designers and theme users, alike. Almost everyone agrees 
there are indicators of premium themes, however:

241
 Chapter 11: Finding and Installing WordPress Themes 
 
✓ Very high quality graphic design and CSS development.
 
✓ A theme structure with functions that make it very easy for the user to 
customize and adjust the theme to suit their own needs. This includes, 
but is not limited to, altering the header graphic/logo and color scheme 
and changing images and icons.
 
✓ Comprehensive documentation, providing the user with extensive 
instructions on how to use the theme, especially if the theme has mul-
tiple features and customization options.
 
✓ Premium themes are fully supported by the designer who created them. 
Typically, when you buy a premium theme, you should expect full sup-
port on the use of that theme for as long as you’re using it.
 
✓ Premium themes are not free. I’ve seen pricing on premium themes in 
the range of $10 to $500.
 
This is not to say that some free themes don’t have some, or all, the features I 
just listed — it’s just that, for the most part, they don’t. Keep in mind that just 
because a designer calls a theme premium doesn’t mean that the theme has 
passed through any kind of official quality review. One designer’s view of what 
constitutes a premium theme can, and will, differ from the next.
 
Fully investigate any theme before you put money down on it. Some things to 
check out before you pay:
 
✓ E-mail the designer who is selling the premium theme and ask about a 
support policy.
 
✓ Find people who have purchased the theme and contact them to find 
out their experiences with the theme and the designer.
 
✓ Carefully read any terms that the designer has published on his site to 
find out any restrictions that exist with licensing.
 
✓ If the premium theme designer has a support forum, ask whether you 
can browse through the forum to find out how actively the designer 
answers questions and provides support. Are users waiting weeks to get 
their questions answered? Or does the designer seem to be on top of 
support requests?
 
✓ Do a search in Google for the theme and the designer. Often, users of 
premium themes post about their experiences with the theme and the 
designer. You can find out a lot of positive, and potentially, negative 
information about the theme and the designer before you buy it.
While premium themes are cropping up all over the Web, a handful really 
stand out with quality products and services. In the following sections, I cover 
three premium themes for you to check out. Each premium theme is tried and 
true, with a very stable and successful following of clients who use them.

Thesis
Chris Pearson is the designer of the Thesis theme (see Figure 11-6), which 
is a premium theme available in the price range of $87 to $164. The features 
within the Thesis theme give you full control of your theme functions without 
having to possess one single bit of coding ability.
After you’ve installed it on your blog, the Thesis theme has an administrative 
options panel that allows you to configure different elements of the theme 
and display features, such as customizing the CSS, RSS feed configuration 
options, navigation menu options, image rotation that allows you to display 
different images each time your site is reloaded, and defining post display 
options, just to name a few.
You have access to full support from Chris and his community of users 
through a very active support forum on his site. You also have access to life-
time upgrades of the theme as they are available.
The Thesis theme can be found at http://diythemes.com.

his part of the book is about digging into WordPress

A walk-through on essential WordPress template tags and 
functions, basic HTML, and CSS helps you put together a

here are those who like to get their hands dirty (present company 
included!). If you’re one of them, you need to read this chapter. 
WordPress users who create their own themes do so in the interest of:
 
✓ Individuality: Having a theme that no one else has. (If you use one of the 
free themes, you can pretty much count on the fact that at least a dozen 
other WordPress blogs will have the same look as yours.)
 
✓ Creativity: Displaying your own personal flair and style.
 
✓ Control: Having full control of how the blog looks, acts, and delivers 
your content.
Many of you aren’t at all interested in creating your own templates for your 
WordPress blog, however. Sometimes, it’s just easier to leave matters to 
the professionals and to hire an experienced WordPress designer (check 
out Chapter 15) or to use one of the thousands of free themes provided by 
WordPress designers (see Chapter 11). Chapter 18 also tells you where you 
can get ten free WordPress themes.
Creating themes does require you to step into the code of the templates, 
which can be a scary place sometimes — especially if you don’t really know 
what you’re looking at. A good place to start is understanding the structure 
of a WordPress blog. Separately, the parts won’t do you any good. But when 
you put them together, the real magic begins! This chapter covers the basics 
of doing just that, and near the end of the chapter, you find specific steps to 
put your own theme together.

Part V: Customizing WordPress  
 
You don’t need to know HTML to use WordPress. If you plan to create and 
design WordPress themes, however, you need some basic knowledge of HTML 
and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). For assistance with HTML, check out HTML 
4 For Dummies, 5th Edition, by Ed Tittel and Mary Burmeister, or HTML, XML, 
and CSS Bible, 3rd Edition, by Bryan Pfaffenberger, Steven M. Schafer, Chuck 
White, and Bill Karow (both published by Wiley).
Using WordPress Themes: The Basics
A WordPress theme is a collection of WordPress templates made up of 
WordPress template tags. When I refer to a WordPress theme, I’m talking 
about the group of templates that makes up the theme. When I talk about 
a WordPress template, I’m referring to only one of the template files that 
contain WordPress template tags. WordPress template tags make all the tem-
plates work together as a theme (more about this topic later in the chapter).
Understanding theme structure
The rest of this chapter provides important information about the steps to 
take when building a WordPress theme, but here is a brief overview of the 
templates that make up a WordPress theme and where you find them, both 
on your server and within your WordPress Administration panel. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Connect to your Web server via FTP, and have a look at the existing 
WordPress themes on your server.
 
 The correct location is /wp-content/themes/ (see Figure 12-1). When 
you open this folder, you find two default theme folders: Default and 
Classic.
 
 If a theme is uploaded to any folder other than /wp-content/themes, 
it won’t work.
 
2. Open the folder for the default theme (/wp-content/themes/
default), and look at the template files inside.
 
 At minimum, you find these five templates in the default theme:
 
• Stylesheet (style.css)
 
• Header template (header.php)
 
• Main Index (index.php)

249
 Chapter 12: Understanding Themes and Templates
 
• Sidebar template (sidebar.php)
 
• Footer template (footer.php)
 
 These filenames are the same in every WordPress theme. See the 
“Contemplating the Structure of a WordPress Blog” section later in this 
chapter, for more information about these template files.
 
3. Click the Editor link on the Appearance menu to look at the template 
files within a theme.
 
 This page lists the various templates available within the active theme. 
(Figure 12-2 shows the templates in the default Kubrick theme.) A text 
box on the left side of the screen displays the contents of each template, 
and this box is also where you can edit the template file(s). To view and 
edit a template file, click its name in the list on the right side of the page. 
The Edit Themes page also shows the template tags within the template file. 
These tags make all the magic happen in your blog; they connect all the tem-
plates to form a theme. The next section of this chapter discusses these tem-
plate tags in detail, showing you what they mean and how they function. A 
later section provides steps for putting them all together to create your own 
theme (or edit an existing theme).

Connecting templates
The template files don’t work alone; for the theme to function, the files need 
one another. To tie these files together as one working entity, you use tem-
plate tags to pull the information from each template — Header, Sidebar, and 
Footer — into the Main Index. I refer to this procedure as calling one template 
into another. (You can find more information in the “Getting Familiar with the 
Four Main Templates,” section, later in this chapter.)
Contemplating the Structure 
of a WordPress Blog
A WordPress blog, in its very basic form, has four main areas (labeled in 
Figure 12-3).

251
 Chapter 12: Understanding Themes and Templates
 
Figure 12-3: 
The four 
main sec-
tions of a 
WordPress 
blog.
 
Header
Body
Footer
Sidebar
These four main areas appear in the default theme that comes in every ver-
sion of WordPress:
 
✓ Header: This area usually contains the name of the site along with the site 
tagline or slogan. Sometimes, the header also contains a graphic or image.
 
✓ Body: This area is where your blog posts appear in chronological order.
 
✓ Sidebar: This area is where you find lists of blog-related elements, such 
as the blogroll, the archives, and a list of recent posts.
 
✓ Footer: This area, at the bottom of the page, often contains links to 
further information about the blog, such as who designed it, which com-
pany provides hosting for the blog, and copyright information.
These four areas are the absolute bare bones of a basic WordPress blog tem-
plate. You can extend these areas and create new sections that carry more 
information, of course, but for the purpose of this chapter, I’m focusing on 
the basics.

252
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
The default WordPress theme is called Kubrick, and in my opinion, it isn’t 
the best theme to use as an example for people who are brand-new to tem-
plate creation. It’s kind of like teaching your teenager to drive by using a 
brand-new Lamborghini — just a little too much power under the hood for a 
beginner. Because this theme is the default theme available in all WordPress 
installations (including your new blog), however, it makes perfect sense to 
use something that you can reference while reading this chapter. I don’t 
cover all the tags and templates that the Kubrick theme includes; rather, I 
touch on the basics to get you on your way to understanding templates and 
template tags for WordPress.
 
Many themes developed for WordPress are free for public use; I strongly rec-
ommend finding one that you like and downloading it. Use the free themes as 
a jumping-off place to get started in theme development. Really, why reinvent 
the wheel? With the free themes available today, most of the work has already 
been completed for you, and you may find it easier to use one of these themes 
than to start a theme from scratch.
Depending on your skill level, you may find a theme that is easier to work 
with than Kubrick. Each free theme that is available for download is differ-
ent, depending on what the developer included (such as CSS styling, display 
options, format, and layout). So experimenting with a few themes is fun and 
is a great way to learn more about the development of WordPress themes. A 
great place to find free WordPress themes is the official WordPress Theme 
Directory at http://wordpress.org/extend/themes.
To build a basic WordPress theme that covers the four basic areas of a blog, 
you need these five templates:
 
✓ header.php
 
✓ index.php
 
✓ sidebar.php
 
✓ footer.php
 
✓ style.css
Each WordPress theme comes with a stylesheet (style.css), which drives 
the formatting and layout of your blog template in terms of where the ele-
ments are positioned on the page, what the font looks like, what colors your 
hyperlinks will be, and so on. As you may have already figured out, you don’t 
use CSS to put content on your site; rather, you use CSS to style the content 
that’s already there.
Chapter 13 provides information on tweaking the design of your theme by 
combining the template tags presented in this chapter with some CSS adjust-
ments in your theme files.

253
 Chapter 12: Understanding Themes and Templates
Right now, I’m covering only the basics; at the end of this chapter, how-
ever, I provide some ideas on how you can use various templates to further 
extend your blog functionality — using templates for categories, archives, 
static pages, multiple sidebars, and so on. After you build the basics, you can 
spread your wings and step into more advanced themes.
Examining the Anatomy 
of a Template Tag
Before starting to play around with template tags in your WordPress tem-
plates, it’s important to understand what makes up a template tag and why.
WordPress is based in PHP (a scripting language for creating Web pages) and 
uses PHP commands to pull information from the MySQL database. Every tag 
begins with the function to start PHP and ends with a function to stop PHP. 
In the middle of those two commands lives the request to the database that 
tells WordPress to grab the data and display it.
A typical template tag looks like this:
<?php get_info(); ?>
This entire example tells WordPress to do three things:
 
✓ Start PHP (<?php).
 
✓ Use PHP to get information from the MySQL database and deliver it to 
your blog (get_info();).
 
✓ Stop PHP (?>).
In this case, get_info is the actual tag function, which grabs information 
from the database to deliver it to your blog. What information is retrieved 
depends on what tag function appears between the two PHP commands. As 
you may notice, there’s a lot of starting and stopping of PHP throughout the 
WordPress templates. The process seems as though it would be resource 
intensive, if not exhaustive — but it really isn’t.
 
For every PHP command you start, you need a stop command. Every time a 
command begins with <?php, somewhere later in the code is the closing ?> 
command. PHP commands that aren’t structured properly cause really ugly 
errors on your site, and they’ve been known to send programmers, develop-
ers, and hosting providers into loud screaming fits.

254
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
Getting Familiar with the 
Four Main Templates
In the following sections, I cover some of the template tags that pull in the 
information you want to include in your blog. To keep this chapter shorter 
than 1,000 pages, I focus on the four main templates that get you going with 
creating your own theme or with editing the template tags in the theme 
you’re currently using. Here are those four main templates:
 
✓ Header
 
✓ Main Index
 
✓ Sidebar
 
✓ Footer
The Header template
The Header template for your WordPress themes is the starting point for 
every WordPress theme, because it tells Web browsers the following:
 
✓ The title of your blog
 
✓ The location of the CSS
 
✓ The RSS feed URL
 
✓ The blog URL
 
✓ The tagline (or description) of the blog
 
Every page on the Web has to start with a few pieces of code. In every header.
php file in any WordPress theme, you’ll find these bits of code at the top:
 
✓ The DOCTYPE (which stands for document type declaration) tells the 
browser which type of XHTML standards you’re using.
 
✓ The <head> tag tells the browser that the information contained within 
the tag shouldn’t be displayed on the site; rather, it’s information about 
the document.
 
✓ The <html> tag (HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language) tells the 
browser which language you’re using to write your Web page.
In a WordPress Header template, these bits of code look like the following 
example, and you should leave them intact:

255
 Chapter 12: Understanding Themes and Templates
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 
Transitional//EN” “http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/
DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd”>
<html xmlns=”http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml” <?php language_
attributes(); ?>>
<head profile=”http://gmpg.org/xfn/11”>
The <head> tag needs to be closed at the end of the Header template, which 
looks like this: </head>. You also need to include a fourth tag, the <body> 
tag, which tells the browser where the information you want to display 
begins. Both the <body> and <html> tags need to be closed at the end of the 
template, like this: </body></html>.
Using bloginfo parameters
Interestingly enough, all the information that I just listed about your blog is 
included in the Header template through the use of a single WordPress tag: 
bloginfo();.
What differentiates the type of information that a tag pulls in is a parameter. 
Parameters are placed inside the parentheses of the tag, enclosed in single 
quotes. For the most part, these parameters pull information from the set-
tings in your WordPress Administration panel. The template tag to get your 
blog title, for example, looks like this:
<?php bloginfo(‘name’); ?>
Table 12-1 lists the various parameters you need for the bloginfo(); tag 
and shows you what the template tag looks like.

Creating title tags and popular characters
Here’s a useful tip about your blog’s <title> tag: Search engines pick up the 
words used in the <title> tag as keywords to categorize your site in their 
search engine directories. The blog <title> tag is the code that lives in the 
Header template between these two tag markers: <title></title>. In the 
default Kubrick theme, this bit of code looks like this:
<title><?php if (is_single() || is_page() || is_archive()) 
{ wp_title(‘’,true); } else { bloginfo(‘name’); 
echo(‘ &#8212; ‘); bloginfo(‘description’); } 
?></title>
It may help for me to put this example into plain English. First, the 
<title></title> tags are HTML tags that tell the browser to display the 
title of your Web site in the title bar of the browser. Figure 12-4 shows how 
the title of my personal blog sits in the title bar of the browser window. 
(The title bar is the top bar in your browser. In Figure 12-4, it says Lisa 
Sabin-Wilson — Designer, Author: WordPress For Dummies.)
 
Search engines love the title bar; the more you can tweak that title to provide 
detailed descriptions of your site, the more the search engines will love you. 
They’ll show that love by giving you higher rankings in their results. For more 
information and tips on search engine optimization (SEO) with WordPress, see 
Chapter 14.
Here’s how to deconstruct the rest of the code between those <title> tags:
 
✓ The first part of this code tells your WordPress blog: If this is a single 
post, a page, or an archive, display the title of that post, page, or archive 
first in the title bar:
<?php if (is_single() || is_page() || is_archive()) { wp_title(‘’,true); }

257
 Chapter 12: Understanding Themes and Templates
 
✓ The second part of the code tells WordPress this: If the page being viewed 
is anything other than a single post, a page, or an archive, display the site 
name and description as provided in the WordPress settings:
else { bloginfo(‘name’); echo(‘ &raquo; ‘); bloginfo(‘description’); } ?>
If your reader is on a single blog-post page, this tag tells WordPress to dis-
play the title of the post followed by the name of your site. This setup is great 
for search engines, because the name of your post provides some rich key-
word content that search engines eat up like candy.
 
The title bar of the browser window always displays your blog name unless 
you’re on a single post page. In that case, it displays your blog title plus the 
title of the post on that page.
Within some of the WordPress template tags, such as the <title> tag in the 
earlier example, you may notice some weird characters that look like a for-
eign language. You may wonder what &raquo; is, for example. It isn’t part of 
any PHP function or CSS style. Rather, it’s a character entity — a kind of code 
that enables you to display a special character in your blog. The &raquo; 
character entity displays a double right-angle quotation mark. See Table 12-2 
for examples of common character entities.

Displaying your blog name and tagline
The default Kubrick theme header displays your blog name and tagline. My 
blog name and tagline are
 
✓ Blog name: Lisa-Wilson Sabin
 
✓ Blog tagline: Designer, Author: WordPress For Dummies
Refer to Figure 12-4 to see these two elements in the header of the site.
You can use the bloginfo(); tag plus a little HTML code to display your 
blog name and tagline. Most blogs have a clickable title, which is a site title 
that takes you back to the main page when it’s clicked. No matter where your 
visitors are on your site, they can always go back home by clicking the title of 
your site in the header.
To create a clickable title, use the following code:
<a href=”<?php bloginfo(‘url’); ?>”><?php 
bloginfo(‘name’); ?></a>
The bloginfo(‘url’); tag is your main blog Internet address, and the 
bloginfo(‘name’); tag is the name of your blog (refer to Table 12-1). So 
the code creates a link that looks something like this:
<a href=”http://yourdomain.com”>Your Blog Name</a>
The tagline generally isn’t linked back home. You can display it by using the 
following tag:
<?php bloginfo(‘description’); ?>

259
 Chapter 12: Understanding Themes and Templates
This tag pulls the tagline directly from the one that you’ve set up in the 
Administration panel.
This example shows how WordPress is intuitive and user-friendly; you can 
do things such as changing the blog name and tagline with a few keystrokes 
in the Administration panel. Changing your options in the Administration 
panel creates the change on every page of your site — no coding experience 
required. Beautiful, isn’t it?
In the Kubrick template, these tags are surrounded by tags that look like 
these: <h1></h1> or <h4></h4>. These tags are <header> tags, which 
define the look and layout of the blog name and tagline in the CSS of your 
theme. I cover CSS further in Chapter 13.
The Main Index template
The Main Index template drags your blog posts out of the MySQL database 
and inserts them into your blog. This template is to your blog what the dance 
floor is to a nightclub — where all the action happens.
The filename of the Main Index template is index.php. You can find it in the 
/wp-content/themes/ folder.
The first template tag in the Main Index template calls in the Header tem-
plate, meaning that it pulls the information from the Header template into the 
Main Index template, as follows:
<?php get_header(); ?>
Your theme can work without calling in the Header template, but it’ll be miss-
ing several essential pieces — the CSS and the blog name and tagline, for 
starters. Without the call to the Header template, your blog will resemble the 
image shown in Figure 12-5.
The Loop
I’m not talking about America’s second-largest downtown business district, 
originating at the corner of State and Madison streets in Chicago. I could 
write about some interesting experiences I’ve had there . . . but that would be 
a different book.
The Loop in this case is a function that WordPress uses to display the posts 
on your blog. The Loop has a starting point and an ending point; anything 
placed in between is used to display each post, including any HTML, PHP, or 
CSS tags and codes.

It’s naked!
 
 
In your travels as a WordPress user, you may run across plugins or scripts 
with instructions that say something like this: “This must be placed within The 
Loop.” That’s The Loop that I discuss in this section, so pay particular atten-
tion. Understanding The Loop arms you with the knowledge you need for tack-
ling and understanding your WordPress themes.
Quite a few variations of the WordPress Loop are available, but I cover the 
most common use in this section. When you understand the common use, 
you can begin to push the envelope a bit further and use variations to suit 
your needs. This common use displays your posts in chronological order, 
starting with your most recent post and followed by less recent posts, 
ordered by date.
The Loop starts with this code (which is inside the Main Index template of 
the default Kubrick theme):
<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
Several lines later is the code that ends The Loop:
<?php endwhile; ?>

261
 Chapter 12: Understanding Themes and Templates
The Loop is no different from any other template tag; it must begin with a 
function to start PHP, and it must end with a function to stop PHP. The Loop 
begins with PHP and then makes a request: “While there are posts in my blog, 
display them on this page.” This PHP function tells WordPress to grab the 
blog post information from the database and return it to the blog page. The 
end of The Loop is like a traffic cop with a big red stop sign telling WordPress 
to stop the function completely.
 
You can set the number of posts displayed per page in the Administration 
panel. The Loop abides by this rule and displays only the number of posts per 
page that you’ve set.
The big if
PHP functions in a pretty simple, logical manner. It functions by doing what 
you and I do on a daily basis — making decisions based on questions and 
answers. PHP deals with three basic variables:
 
✓ if
 
✓ then
 
✓ else
The basic idea is this: IF this, THEN that, or ELSE this.
The code directly above the start of The Loop looks like this:
<?php if (have_posts()) : ?>
This if statement asks the question, “Does this blog have posts?”
If the answer is yes, WordPress proceeds with The Loop, starting with the 
piece of code that looks like this:
<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
This code tells WordPress to grab the posts from the MySQL database and 
display them on your blog page.
Then The Loop closes with this tag:
<?php endwhile; ?>
If the answer to the if question (“Does this blog have posts?”) is no, 
WordPress skips The Loop and displays a message that no posts exist. It 
accomplishes this task through the else statement, directly below the end 
of The Loop:

<p class=”center”>Sorry, but you are looking for something 
that isn’t here.</p>
<?php include (TEMPLATEPATH . “/searchform.php”); ?>
With the PHP, WordPress displays the title Not Found, followed by the state-
ment Sorry, but you are looking for something that isn’t here, followed by the 
template tag to include a search box that lets users search your blog for 
more information.
Every good PHP function has to come to an end. The if statement ends in 
the next line of code:
<?php endif; ?>
Following the if, then, else logic, Table 12-3 breaks down the logic of The 
Loop. In the “Customizing Your Blog Posts with Template Tags,” section later 
in this chapter, I get into the fun part of providing all the different template 
tags that you can include within The Loop.
Table 12-3 
Deconstructing The Loop
Code
What It Means
<?php if (have_posts()) : 
?>
Poses the question “Does this blog 
have posts?”
<?php while (have_posts()) 
: the_post(); ?>
If the answer is yes, this piece of 
code tells WordPress to retrieve the 
blog posts from the database and dis-
play them on the page.
<?php endwhile; ?>
Ends the display of blog posts, ending 
the loop.
<?php else : ?>
<h2 class=”center”>Not 
Found</h2>
<p class=”center”>Sorry, 
but you are looking for 
something that isn’t 
here.</p>
<?php include (TEMPLATEPATH 
. “/searchform.php”); ?>
If the answer is no, the blog doesn’t 
have posts. WordPress displays the 
title Not Found, followed by the state-
ment Sorry, but you are looking for 
something that isn’t here, followed by 
the template tag to include a search 
box that lets users search your blog 
for more information.
<?php endif; ?>
Ends the if question.

 Chapter 12: Understanding Themes and Templates
The Sidebar template
The filename of the Sidebar template is sidebar.php. Typically, the side-
bar is displayed on the right or left side of your WordPress template. In the 
default Kubrick theme, the sidebar is displayed on the right side of the tem-
plate (refer to Figure 12-3).
Similarly to the Header template, the Sidebar template is called into the Main 
Index template with this function:
<?php get_sidebar(): ?>
This code calls the Sidebar template and all the information it contains into 
your blog page. Chapter 14 addresses some additional ways you can call in 
the Sidebar template, including having multiple Sidebar templates and using 
an include statement to pull them into the Main Index template.
In the “Using Tags with Parameters for Sidebars,” section later in this chapter, 
you find information on template tags to use in the sidebar to display the usual 
sidebar elements, such as a list of the most recent posts or a list of categories.
The Footer template
The filename of the Footer template is footer.php. Usually, the footer sits 
at the bottom of the page (refer to Figure 12-3) and contains brief information 
about the site, such as copyright statements, credits to the theme designer 
or hosting company, or even a list of links to other pages within the site.
The default Kubrick theme shows site ownership information and RSS feed 
links for the blog. You can use the footer to include all sorts of information 
about your site, however; you don’t have to restrict it to small bits of infor-
mation. In this chapter, I cover the typical footer that you see in the default 
Kubrick theme.
If, then, and else
In our daily lives, we deal with if, then, else situ-
ations every day, as in these examples:
 ✓ IF I have a dollar, THEN I’ll buy coffee, or 
ELSE I’ll drink water.
 ✓ IF it’s warm outside, THEN I’ll take a walk, 
or ELSE I’ll stay in.
 ✓ IF I understand this code, THEN I’ll be 
happy, or ELSE I’ll rip my hair out.

264
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
Similarly to the Header and Sidebar templates, the Footer template gets 
called into the Main Index template through this bit of code:
<?php get_footer(); ?>
This code calls the Footer and all the information it contains into your blog page.
Other templates
Other templates are in the default Kubrick theme, and I don’t cover them in 
depth in this chapter, but having at least a basic understanding of them is 
a good idea. The ones I list in this section give you that good, solid kick in 
the pants you need to get started with understanding WordPress templates. 
When you have that task licked, you can move on to learning the rest.
These other (optional) templates include
 
✓ Comments template (comments.php): Table 12-10, later in this chapter, 
lists some useful template tags for WordPress. The Comments template 
is required if you plan to host comments on your blog; it provides all the 
template tags you need to display those comments. The template tag 
used to call the comments into the template is <?php comments_
template(); ?>.
 
✓ Single Post template (single.php): When your visitors click the title 
or permalink of a post you’ve published to your blog, they’re taken to 
that post’s individual page. There, they can read the entire post, and if 
you have comments enabled, they see the comments form and can leave 
comments (see Figure 12-6).
 
✓ Page template (page.php): You can use a Page template for static pages 
in your WordPress site.
 
✓ Search Results (search.php): You can use this template to create a 
custom display of search results on your blog. When someone uses the 
search feature to search your site for specific keywords, this template 
formats the return of those results.
 
✓ 404 template (404.php): Use this template to create a custom 404 page, 
which is the page visitors get when the browser can’t find the page 
requested and returns that ugly 404 Page Cannot Be Found error.
 
The templates in the preceding list are optional. If these templates don’t exist 
in your WordPress themes folder, nothing breaks. The Main Index template 
handles the display of these items (the single post page, the search results 
page, and so on). The only exception is the Comments template. If you want to 
display comments on your site, you must have that template.

Customizing Your Blog Posts 
with Template Tags
This section covers the template tags that you use to display the body of 
each blog post you publish. The body of a blog post includes information 
such as the post date and time, title, author name, category, and content. 
Table 12-4 lists the common template tags you can use for posts, available in 
the default Kubrick theme. The tags in Table 12-4 work only if you place them 
within The Loop (covered earlier in this chapter).
Table 12-4

<?php the_date(); ?>

Displays the URL of the post author’s site.
<?php the_

Displays the content of the post. (If you use an 
excerpt [below], the words Read More appear 
and are linked to the individual post page.)
<?php the_

Displays an excerpt (snippet) of the post.
<?php the_
category(‘,’); ?>
Displays the category (or categories) assigned 
to the post. If the post is assigned to multiple 
categories, they’ll be separated by commas.
<?php comments_
popup_link(‘No 
Comments’, 
‘Comment (1)’, 
‘Comments(%)’); ?>
Displays a link to the comments, along with the 
comment count for the post in parentheses. (If 
no comments exist, it displays a No Comments 
message.)
<?php next_posts_
link(‘&laquo; 
Previous Entries’) ?>
Displays the words Previous Entries linked to the 
previous page of blog entries.*
<?php previous_
posts_link(‘Next 
Entries &raquo;’) ?>
Displays the words Next Entries linked to the 
next page of blog entries.*
* These two tags aren’t like the others. You don’t place these tags in The Loop; instead, you insert 
them after The Loop but before the if statement ends. Here’s an example:
<?php endwhile; ?>
<?php next_posts_link(‘&laquo; Previous Entries’) ?>
<?php previous_posts_link(‘Next Entries &raquo;’) ?>
<?php endif; ?>
Putting a Theme Together
In this section, you put together the guts of a Main Index template by using 
the information on templates and tags I’ve provided so far in this chapter. 
You create a new WordPress theme, using some of the basic templates 
included in the default Kubrick theme. The first steps in pulling everything 
together are as follows:

267
 Chapter 12: Understanding Themes and Templates
 
1. Connect to your Web server via FTP, click the wp-content folder, 
and then click the themes folder.
 
 This folder contains the themes that are currently installed in your 
WordPress blog. (See Chapter 6 if you need more information on FTP.)
 
2. Create a new folder, and call it mytheme.
 
 In most FTP programs, you can right-click and choose New Folder. (If you 
aren’t sure how to create a folder, refer to your FTP program’s help files.)
 
3. Upload the following files from the default Kubrick theme:
 
• sidebar.php
 
• footer.php
 
• header.php
 
• style.css
 
• comments.php
 
• The images folder
 
 You find the default Kubrick theme files in the original WordPress files 
that you downloaded from the WordPress Web site. Do not upload the 
index.php file, as you are about to create your own index.php file in 
the next section.
Using the tags provided in Table 12-4, along with the information on The 
Loop and the calls to the Header, Sidebar, and Footer templates provided in 
earlier sections, you can follow the next steps for a bare-bones example of 
what the Main Index template looks like when you put the tags together.
 
When typing templates, be sure to use a text editor such as Notepad or 
TextEdit. Using a word processing program such as Microsoft Word opens a 
whole slew of problems in your code. Word processing programs insert hidden 
characters and format quotation marks in a way that WordPress can’t read.
To create a Main Index template to work with the other templates in your 
WordPress theme, open a new window in a text editor program and then 
follow these steps. (Type the text in each of these steps on its own line. Press 
the Enter key after typing each line so that each tag starts on a new line.)
 
1. Type <?php get_header(); ?>.
 
 This template tag pulls the information in the Header template of your 
WordPress theme.
 
2. Type <?php if (have_posts()) : ?>.
 
 This template tag is an if statement that asks, “Does this blog have 
posts?” If the answer is yes, it grabs the post content information from 
your MySQL database and displays the posts in your blog.

268
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
 
3. Type <?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>.
 
 This template tag starts The Loop.
 
4. Type <a href=”<?php the_permalink(); ?>”><?php the_
title(); ?></a>.
 
 This tag tells your blog to display the title of a post that’s clickable 
(linked) to the URL of the post.
 
5. Type Posted on <?php the_date(); ?> at <?php the_
time(); ?>.
 
 This template tag displays the date and time when the post was made. 
With these template tags, the date and time format are determined by 
the format you set in the Administration panel.
 
6. Type Posted in <?php the_category(‘,’); ?>.
 
 This template tag displays a comma-separated list of the categories to 
which you’ve assigned the post — Posted in: category 1, category 2, for 
example.
 
7. Type <?php the_content(‘Read More..’); ?>.
 
 This template tag displays the actual content of the blog post. The 
‘Read More..’ portion of this tag tells WordPress to display the 
words Read More, which are clickable (hyperlinked) to the post’s perma-
link, where the reader can read the rest of the post in its entirety. This 
tag applies when you’re displaying a post excerpt, as determined by the 
actual post configuration in the Administration panel.
 
8. Type Posted by: <?php the_author(); ?>.
 
 This template tag displays the author of the post in this manner: Posted 
by: Lisa Sabin-Wilson.
 
9. Type <?php comments_popup_link(‘No Comments’, ‘1 
Comment’, ‘% Comments’); ?>.
 
 This template tag displays the link to the comments for this post, along 
with the number of comments.
 
10. Type <?php comments_template(); ?>.
 
 This template tag calls in the Comments template (comments.php). All 
code and information in the Comments template is pulled into the Main 
Index template at this point. The Comments template is displayed only 
on the single post page, however, not on the front page of your blog site.

269
 Chapter 12: Understanding Themes and Templates
 
11. Type <?php endwhile; ?>.
 
 This template tag ends The Loop and tells WordPress to stop displaying 
blog posts here. WordPress knows exactly how many times The Loop 
needs to work, based on the setting in the WordPress Administration 
panel. That’s exactly how many times WordPress will execute The Loop.
 
12. Type <?php next_posts_link(‘&laquo; Previous 
Entries’); ?>.
 
 This template tag displays a clickable link to the previous page of blog 
entries, if any.
 
13. Type <?php previous posts link(‘&raquo; Next 
Entries’); ?>.
 
 This template tag displays a clickable link to the next page of blog 
entries, if any.
 
14. Type <?php else : ?>.
 
 This template tag refers to the if question asked in Step 2. If the answer 
to that question is no, this step provides the else statement — IF this 
blog has posts, THEN list them here (Step 2 and Step 3), or ELSE display 
the following message.
 
15. Type Not Found. Sorry, but you are looking for some-
thing that isn’t here.
 
 This is the message followed by the template tag that is displayed after 
the else statement from Step 14. You can reword this statement to have 
it say whatever you want.
 
16. Type <?php endif; ?>.
 
 This template tag ends the if statement from Step 2.
 
17. Type <?php get_sidebar(); ?>.
 
 This template tag calls in the Sidebar template and pulls that informa-
tion into the Main Index template. (See the “Using Tags with Parameters 
for Sidebars” section later in this chapter, for further descriptions of 
tags for this template.)
 
18. Type <?php get_footer(); ?>.
 
 This template tag calls in the Footer template and pulls that informa-
tion into the Main Index template. Note: The code in the footer.php 
template ends the <body> and the <html> tags that were started in the 
Header template (header.php).

270
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
 
 When you’re done, the display of the Main Index template code looks 
like this:
<?php get_header(); ?>
<?php if (have_posts()) : ?>
 <?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
<div <?php post_class() ?> id=”post-<?php the_ID(); ?>”>
 <a href=”<?php the_permalink(); ?>”><?php the_title(); ?></a>
 Posted on: <?php the_date(); ?> at <?php the_time(); ?>
 Posted in: <?php the_category(‘,’); ?>
 <?php the_content(‘Read More..’); ?>
 Posted by: <?php the_author(); ?> | <?php comments_popup_link(‘No 
Comments’, ‘1 Comment’, ‘% Comments’); ?>
</div>
<?php comments_template(); ?>
 <?php endwhile; ?>
<?php next_posts_link(‘&laquo; Previous Entries’) ?>
<?php previous_posts_link(‘Next Entries &raquo;’) ?>
<?php else : ?>
 Not Found
 Sorry, but you are looking for something that isn’t here.
<?php endif; ?>
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
<?php get_footer(); ?>
 
19. Save this file as index.php, and upload it to the mythemes folder.
 
 In Notepad, you can save it by choosing File➪Save As. Type the name of 
the file in the File Name text box, and click Save.
 
20. Activate the theme in the WordPress Administration panel, and view 
your blog to see your handiwork in action!
 
My Main Index template code has one template tag that is explained in 
Chapter 13: <div <?php post_class() ?> id=”post-<?php the_
ID(); ?>”>. This tag helps you create some interesting styles in your tem-
plate using CSS, so check out Chapter 13 to find out all about it!
Using Tags with Parameters for Sidebars
If you’ve been following along in this chapter as I’ve covered the Header and 
Main Index templates and tags, you have a functional WordPress blog with 
blog posts and various metadata displayed in each post.

271
 Chapter 12: Understanding Themes and Templates
In this section, I give you the template tags for the items commonly placed 
in the sidebar of a blog. I say “commonly placed” because it’s possible to get 
creative with these template tags and place them in other locations (the Footer 
template, for example). To keep this introduction to sidebar template tags 
simple, I stick with the most common use, leaving the creative and uncommon 
uses to you to try when you’re comfortable with building the basics.
This section also introduces tag parameters, which are additional options you 
can include in the tag to control some of its display properties. Not all tem-
plate tags have parameters. You place tag parameters inside the parentheses 
of the tag. Many of the parameters discussed in this section were obtained 
from the WordPress software documentation in the WordPress Codex at 
http://codex.wordpress.org.
Table 12-5 helps you understand the three variations of parameters used by 
WordPress.
Table 12-5 
Three Variations of Template Parameters
Variation
Description
Example
Tags without 
parameters
These tags have no additional 
options available. Tags without 
parameters have nothing within 
the parentheses.
the_tag(); 
Tags with PHP 
function-style 
parameters
These tags have a comma-
separated list of values placed 
within the tag parentheses.
the_tag
(‘1,2,3’); 
Tags with query-
string parameters
These types of tags generally have 
several available parameters. This 
tag style enables you to change the 
value for each parameter without 
being required to provide values for 
all available parameters for the tag.
the_tag
(‘parameter=
true);
You need to know these three types of parameters:
 
✓ String: A line of text that can be anything from a single letter to a long 
list of words. A string is placed between single quotation marks and sets 
an option for the parameter or is displayed as text.
 
✓ Integer: A positive or negative number. Integers are placed within the 
parentheses and either inside or outside single quotation marks. Either 
way, they’ll be processed correctly.
 
✓ Boolean: Sets the parameter options to true or false. This parameter 
can be numeric (0=false and 1=true) or textual. Boolean parameters 
aren’t placed within quotation marks.

272
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
 
The WordPress Codex, located at http://codex.wordpress.org, has 
every conceivable template tag and possible parameter known to the 
WordPress software. The tags and parameters that I share with you in this 
chapter are the ones used most often.
The Calendar
The calendar tag displays a calendar that highlights each day of the week 
on which you’ve posted a blog. Those days are also hyperlinked to the origi-
nal blog post.
Here’s the tag to use to display the calendar:
<?php get_calendar(); ?>
The calendar tag has only one parameter, and it’s Boolean. Set this parame-
ter to true, and it displays the day of the week with one letter (Friday = F, for 
example.) Set this parameter to false, and it displays the day of the week as 
a three-letter abbreviation (Friday = Fri., for example).
Here are examples of the template tag used to display the calendar on your 
WordPress blog:
<?php get_calendar(true); ?>
<?php get_calendar(false); ?>
List pages
The <?php wp_list_pages(); ?> tag displays a list of the static pages 
you can create on your WordPress site (such as About Me or Contact pages). 
Displaying a link to the static pages makes them available so that readers can 
click the links and read the content you’ve provided.
The <list> tag parameters use the string style. (Table 12-6 lists the most 
common parameters used for the wp_list_pages template tag.)

273
 Chapter 12: Understanding Themes and Templates
Parameter
Type
Description and Values
sort_
column
string
Sorts pages with one of the following options: 
‘post_title’ — Sorts alphabetically by page title 
(default). 
‘menu_order’ — Sorts by page order (the order 
in which they appear in the Manage tab and Pages 
subtab of the Administration panel).
‘post_date’ — Sorts by the date on which pages 
were created.
‘post_modified’ — Sorts by the time when the 
page was last modified. 
‘post_author’ — Sorts by author, according to 
the author ID #. 
‘post_name’ — Sorts alphabetically by the post slug.
Exclude
string
Lists the numeric page ID numbers, separated by 
commas, that you want to exclude from the page list 
display (for example, ‘exclude=10, 20, 30’). 
There is no default value.
Depth
integer
Uses a numeric value for how many levels of pages 
are displayed in the list of pages. Possible options:
0 — Displays all pages, including main and subpages 
(default).
-1 — Shows subpages but doesn’t indent them in the 
list display.
1 — Shows only main pages (no subpages).
show_
date
string
Displays the date when the page was created or last 
modified. Possible options:
‘ ‘ — Displays no date (default).
‘modified’ — Displays the date when the page 
was last modified. 
‘created’ — Displays the date when the page was 
created.
date_
format
string
Sets the format of the date to be displayed. Defaults 
to the date format configured in the Options tab and 
General subtab of the Administration panel.
title_
li
string
Types text for the heading of the page list. Defaults to 
display the text: “Pages”. If value is empty (‘’), no 
heading is displayed; for example, ‘title_li=My 
Pages” displays the heading My Pages above the 
page list.

274
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
Page lists are displayed in an unordered list (you may know it by the term 
bulleted list). Whichever term you use, it’s a list with a bullet point in front of 
every page link.
The following tag and query string displays a list of pages without the text 
heading “Pages”. In other words, it displays no title at the top of the page’s 
link list:
<?php wp_list_pages(‘title_li=’); ?>
The next tag and query string displays the list of pages sorted by the date 
when they were created; the date is also displayed along with the page name:
<?php wp_list_pages(‘sort_column=post_date&show_date=’created’); ?>
 
Take a look at the way query-string parameters are written:
‘parameter1=value&parameter2=value&parameter3=value’
The entire string is surrounded by single quotation marks, and there is no 
white space within the query string. Each parameter is joined to its value 
by the = character. When you use multiple parameters/values, you separate 
them with the & character. You can think of the string like this: parameter1=
valueANDparameter2=valueANDparameter3=value. Keep this convention in 
mind for the remaining template tags and parameters in this chapter.
Bookmarks (blogroll)
In the WordPress Administration panel, you can manage your links from the 
Blogroll tab. Before I forge ahead and dig into the template tag for the display 
of the blogroll, I want to clear up a little terminology.
Identifying some blog-post metadata
Metadata is simply data about data. In 
WordPress, metadata refers to the data about 
each blog post, including:
 ✓ The author name
 ✓ The category or categories to which the 
post is assigned
 ✓ The date and time of the post
 ✓ The comments link and number of 
comments

275
 Chapter 12: Understanding Themes and Templates
A blogroll is a list of links that you add to the Blogroll area in the Administra-
tion panel. The specific template tag used to call those links into your tem-
plate, however, refers to bookmarks. So this begs the question “Are they 
links, or are they bookmarks?” The answer is “Both.” For simplicity, and to 
ensure that you and I are on the same wavelength, I refer to them the same 
way that half the planet does — as links.
Here is the tag used to display your blogroll:
<?php wp_list_bookmarks(); ?>
In Chapter 8, I show you how to add links to your blogroll and also discuss 
the options you can set for each link. The parameters for this tag give you 
control of how the links are displayed and put some of the options to work. 
Table 12-7 shows the most common parameters used for the wp_list_
bookmarks template tag.
 
In the Possible Values column of Table 12-7, values that appear in bold are the 
default values set by WordPress. Keep this convention in mind for all the 
parameter values in the rest of this chapter.

that helps you and your readers find posts you’ve made on certain topics.

280
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
The <?php wp_list_categories(); ?> template tag lets you display a 
list of your categories by using the available parameters and values. (Table 
12-9 shows some of the most popular parameters.) Each category is linked 
to the appropriate category page that lists all the posts you’ve assigned to it. 
The values that appear in bold are the default values set by WordPress.

Tweaking WordPress Themes
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring basic CSS
▶ Defining CSS properties and values
▶ Setting a new background color
▶ Creating a header
▶ Changing fonts
C
hapter 11 shows how you can use free WordPress themes in your blog. 
Many people are quite happy to use these themes without making any 
adjustments to them at all. I can’t tell you, however, how many times people 
have asked me how they can customize a theme that they’ve found. They say 
things like these:
 
✓ “I like this free theme I found, but I’d really like to change the header 
image. How do I do that?”
 
✓ “I found this great theme, but I really need to change the background 
color from black to pink. Can I do that, or do I need to hire someone?”
 
✓ “This theme I have is perfect, although I wish I could change the font 
from Times New Roman to Tahoma. Can you tell me how to do that?”
The practice of changing a few elements of an existing WordPress theme is 
tweaking. Thousands of WordPress blog owners tweak their existing themes 
on a regular basis. This chapter provides information on some of the most 
common tweaks you can make to your theme, such as changing the header 
image, changing the color of the background or the text links, and chang-
ing font styles — and these changes are pretty easy to make, too! You’ll be 
tweaking your own theme in no time flat.
 
Before you go too wild with tweaking templates, make a backup of your theme 
so that you have the original files, from which you can easily restore if you 
need to. You can back up your theme files by connecting to your Web server 
via FTP (see Chapter 6) and downloading your theme folder to your computer. 
When you have the original theme files safe and secure on your hard drive, 
feel free to tweak away, comfortable in the knowledge that you have a backup.

Part V: Customizing WordPress  
Styling with CSS: The Basics
A Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is in every single WordPress theme you use 
in your blog. The CSS provides style and design flair to the template tags in 
your templates. (See Chapter 12 for information about WordPress template 
tags.) The CSS for your WordPress theme is pulled in through the Header 
template (header.php) and is named style.css.
In your Administration panel, click the Editor link on the Appearances menu, 
and look at the Header template for the Default WordPress theme by clicking 
the Header link on the Edit Themes page. You find the following line of code, 
which pulls the CSS (style.css) into the page to provide the formatting of 
the elements of your blog:
<link rel=”stylesheet” href=”<?php bloginfo(‘stylesheet_
url’); ?>” type=”text/css” media=”screen” />
 
Do not tweak the line of code that pulls in the style.css file; otherwise, the 
CSS won’t work for your blog.
CSS selectors
With CSS, you can provide style (such as size, color, and placement) to the 
display of elements on your blog (such as text links, header images, font 
size and colors, paragraph margins, and line spacing). CSS selectors contain 
names, properties, and values to define which HTML elements in the tem-
plates you will style with CSS. Table 13-1 provides some examples of CSS 
selectors and their use.

Classes and IDs
Look at the stylesheet for the Default WordPress theme (see Figure 13-1). 
Everything in it may look foreign to you right now, but I want to bring your 
attention to two items:
 
✓ #page: One type of CSS selector. The hash mark (#) indicates that it’s a 
CSS ID.
 
✓ .narrowcolumn: Another type of CSS selector. The period (.) indicates 
that it’s a CSS class.
IDs and classes define styling properties for different sections of your 
WordPress theme. Table 13-2 shows examples of IDs and classes from the 
header.php template in the Default WordPress theme. Armed with this 
information, you’ll know where to look in the stylesheet when you want to 
change the styling for a particular area of your theme.
Table 13-2 
Connecting HTML with CSS Selectors

header ID in your template(s)
<div id=

Part V: Customizing WordPress  
 
Figure 13-1: 
The 
WordPress 
default 
theme 
stylesheet 
(style.
css).
 
 
If you find an element in the template code that says id (such as div id= or 
p id=), look for the hash symbol in the stylesheet. If you find an element in 
the template code that says class (such as div class= or p class=), look 
for the period in the stylesheet followed by the selector name.
CSS properties and values
CSS properties are assigned to the CSS selector name. You also need to pro-
vide values for the CSS properties to define the style elements for the particu-
lar CSS selector you’re working with.
In the Default WordPress theme, for example, the first piece of markup in 
the Header template (header.php) is <div id=”page”>. This ID, with the 
name page, provides styling for the site page.
In the Default WordPress theme stylesheet, the CSS defined for the page ID is 
as follows:
#page {
   background-color: white;
   border: 1px solid #959596;
   text-align: left;
   }

287
 Chapter 13: Tweaking WordPress Themes 
 
Every CSS property needs to be followed by a colon (:), and each CSS value 
needs to be followed by a semicolon (;).
The CSS selector is #page, which has three properties:
 
✓ The first CSS property is background-color, which has the value white.
 
✓ The second CSS property is border, which has the value 1px solid 
#959596 (border thickness, style, and color values, respectively).
 
✓ The last CSS property is text-align, which has the value left.
Table 13-3 provides some examples of commonly used CSS properties and 
values.

288
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
Changing the Background Color
In Chapter 12, I discuss the Header template (header.php) in detail. In 
this section, I show you how to tweak the <body> tag in that template. The 
<body> tag is simple HTML markup. Every theme has this tag, which defines 
the overall default content for each page of your Web site — the site’s body.
In the stylesheet (style.css), the body styles are defined like this:
body {
font-size: 62.5%; /* Resets 1em to 10px */
font-family: ‘Lucida Grande’, Verdana, Arial, Sans-Serif;
background: #d5d6d7 url(‘images/kubrickbgcolor.jpg’);
color: #333;
text-align: center;
}
The background for the <body> tag uses a color and an image:
 
✓ Color: A hexadecimal (or hex) code represents a certain color. Hex 
codes always start with a hash symbol (#) and have six letters and/or 
numbers to represent a particular color; in this case, #d5d6d7. Table 
13-4 lists some common colors and the corresponding hex codes. (The 
W3Schools Web site has a great resource on hex codes at http://
w3schools.com/HTML/html_colornames.asp.)
 
✓ Image: You can easily use an image as a background for your site by 
uploading the image to the images folder in your theme directory. That 
value looks like background: url(images/yourimage.jpg). In this 
case, the image is url(‘images/kubrickbgcolor.jpg’);. (Note: 
The url portion of this code automatically pulls in the URL of your blog, 
so you don’t have to change the url part to your URL.)
 
You can also use a combination of colors and images in your backgrounds.

In the case of some basic colors, you don’t have to use the hex code. For colors 
such as white, black, red, blue, and silver, you can just use their names — 
background-color: white, for example.
If you want to change the background color of your theme, follow these steps:
 
1. In the WordPress Administration panel, click the Editor link on the 
Appearance menu.
 
 The Edit Themes page opens.
 
2. From the Select Theme to Edit drop-down menu, choose the theme 
you want to change.
 
 If you want to change the WordPress default theme, for example, choose it.
 
3. Click the Stylesheet template link.
 
 The style.css template opens in the text editor on the left side of the 
Theme Editor page (refer to Figure 13-1).
 
4. Scroll down in the text editor until you find the CSS selector body.
 
 If you’re tweaking the default theme, this section is what you’re looking for:
body {
font-size: 62.5%; /* Resets 1em to 10px */
font-family: ‘Lucida Grande’, Verdana, Arial, Sans-Serif;
background: #d5d6d7 url(‘images/kubrickbgcolor.jpg’);
color: #333;
text-align: center;
}
 
 If you’re tweaking a different template, the CSS selector body will look 
similar.
 
5. Edit the background property’s values.
 
 In the default template, you’re changing
background: #d5d6d7 url(‘images/kubrickbgcolor.jpg’);
 
 to black
background: black;
 
 If you’d like to use a hex code, refer to Table 13-4.

6. Click the Update File button in the bottom-left corner of the page.
 
 Your changes are saved and applied to your theme.
 
7. Visit your site in your Web browser.
 
 The background color of your theme has changed.
Figure 13-2 shows how I changed the default theme’s background color from 
white to black. The page may not be very pretty, but for the purpose of show-
ing you how you can edit the background color of any theme you’re using, it 
works.

Using Your Own Header Image
Most themes have a header image that displays at the top of the page. This 
image is generated by a graphic defined in the CSS value for the property that 
represents the header area. In the WordPress default theme, you find the 
markup for the header image in the Header template (header.php), and it 
looks like this:

291
 Chapter 13: Tweaking WordPress Themes 
<div id=”header”>
<div id=”headerimg”>
<h1><a href=”<?php echo get_option(‘home’); ?>/”><?php 
bloginfo(‘name’); ?></a></h1>
<div class=”description”><?php bloginfo(‘description’); 
?></div>
</div>
</div>
Several elements are in play within this code:
 
✓ <div id=”header”>: This line defines the actual image file used for 
the header of the theme. It corresponds with the #header selector in 
the stylesheet. To change the image, you change the image-name value 
in the background property of the #header CSS selector.
 
✓ <div id=”headerimg”>: This line defines the height and width of the 
image used for the header. It corresponds with the #headerimg selec-
tor in the stylesheet. To change the dimensions of the image, change 
the height and width values in the background property of the 
#headerimg CSS selector.
 
✓ <h1><a href=”<?php echo get_option(‘home’); ?>/”><?php 
bloginfo(‘name’); ?></a></h1>: This line is the name of your 
blog, linked to your home page. All this code is wrapped in <h1></
h1> HTML tags. (See Chapter 12 for more information on the bloginfo 
template tags and how they are used in WordPress templates.) The code 
corresponds to the h1 selector in the theme’s stylesheet.
 
✓ <div class=”description”><?php bloginfo(‘description’); 
?></div>: This line is the description/tagline of your site, wrapped in 
<div class=”description”></div> HTML tags. It corresponds to 
the .description selector in the theme’s stylesheet.
 
✓ </div>: This line is the div tag that closes the <div 
id=”headerimg”> markup.
 
✓ </div>: This code is the div tag that closes the <div id=”header”> 
markup.
 
 Whenever you open a <div> tag, you have to close it with a </div> tag.
The only element you need to change is the image for the header. When you 
have the image you want to use to replace the default header image (I recom-
mend using gif, jpg, jpeg, or png formats for this), follow these steps:
 
1. Upload your image via FTP to the images folder in the theme directory.
 
 If you’re changing the default theme, for example, upload your image to 
/wp-content/themes/default/images/.

292
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
 
2. In the WordPress Administration panel, click the Design tab and then 
click the Theme Editor subtab.
 
 The Theme Editor page opens.
 
3. From the Select Theme to Edit drop-down menu, choose the theme 
you want to change.
 
 If you want to change the default theme, choose WordPress Default.
 
4. Click the Stylesheet template link to open it.
 
 The style.css file opens in the text editor on the left side of the 
Theme Editor page.
 
5. Scroll down in the text editor until you find the CSS selector #header.
 
 If you’re changing the default theme, this section is what you’re looking for:
<div id=”header”>
<div id=”headerimg”>
<h1><a href=”<?php echo get_option(‘home’); ?>/”><?php bloginfo(‘name’); 
?></a></h1>
<div class=”description”><?php bloginfo(‘description’); ?></div>
</div>
</div>
 
 If you’re tweaking a different theme, your CSS selector will look similar 
to this one.
 
6. Edit the background property’s values for the #header selector.
 
 If you want to change the image, you’re changing
background: #73a0c5 url(‘images/kubrickheader.jpg’) no-repeat bottom 
center;
 
 to this

Changing Font Styles, Colors, and Sizes
Fonts come in all shapes and sizes, and you can use CSS to define the font 
styles that display in your blog. Changing the font can change the look and 
feel of your blog dramatically, as well as improve your readers’ experience 
by making the text easy on the eyes. Table 13-5 displays some of the most 
commonly used CSS properties and values for applying font styling to your 
stylesheet.

Part V: Customizing WordPress  
The Web is actually kind of picky about how it displays fonts, as well as what 
kind of fonts you can use in the font-family property. Not all fonts display 
correctly on the Web. To be safe, here are some commonly used font families 
that display correctly in most browsers:
 
✓ Serif fonts: Times New Roman, Georgia, Garamond, Bookman Old Style
 
✓ Sans-serif fonts: Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS
 
Serif fonts have little tails, or curlicues, at the edges of letters. (This text is in a 
serif font.) Sans-serif fonts have straight edges and are devoid of any fancy 
styling. (The heading in Table 13-5 uses a sans-serif font.)
When you want to change a font family in your CSS, open the stylesheet 
(style.css), search for property: font-family, change the values for 
that property, and save your changes.
In the default template CSS, the font is defined in the <body> tag like this:
font-family: ‘Lucida Grande’, Verdana, Arial, Sans-Serif
You can easily change the color of your font by changing the color property 
of the CSS selector you want to tweak. You can use hex codes (refer to Table 
13-4) to define the colors.
In the default template CSS, the font color is defined in the <body> tag like this:
color: #333;
To tweak the size of your font, change the font-size property of the CSS 
selector you want to change. Font sizes generally are determined by units of 
measurement, as in these examples:
 
✓ px: pixel measurement. Increasing or decreasing the number of pixels 
increases or decreases the font size (12px is larger than 10px).
 
✓ pt: point measurement. As with pixels, increasing or decreasing the 
number of points affects the font size accordingly (12pt is larger than 
10pt).
 
✓ %: percentage measurement. Increasing or decreasing the percentage 
number affects the font size accordingly (50% is the equivalent to 7 
pixels; 100% is the equivalent to 17 pixels).
In the default template CSS, the font size is defined in the body tag as a per-
centage, like this: 
font-size: 62.5%;

295
 Chapter 13: Tweaking WordPress Themes 
Putting all three elements (font-family, color, and font-size) together in the 
<body> tag, they style the font for the overall body of your site. Here’s how 
they work together in the <body> tag of the default template CSS:
body {
font-size: 62.5%; /* Resets 1em to 10px */
font-family: ‘Lucida Grande’, Verdana, Arial, Sans-Serif;
color: #333;
}
Finding Additional CSS Resources
Table 13-6 lists some excellent CSS resources on the Web that you may find 
helpful for creating or editing a theme’s stylesheet. Or you may want to pick 
up a copy of CSS Web Design For Dummies, by Richard Mansfield (published 
by Wiley).

I
f you’ve avoided using WordPress as a solution for building your own Web 
site because you think it’s only a blogging platform, and you don’t want 
to have a blog (not every Web site owner does, after all), it’s time to rethink 
your position. The self-hosted version of WordPress, WordPress.org, is a 
powerful Content Management System (CMS) that is flexible and extensible 
enough to run an entire Web site — with no blog at all, if you prefer.
A Content Management System (CMS) is a system used to create and maintain 
your entire site. It includes tools for publishing and editing, as well as for 
searching and retrieving information and content. A CMS lets you maintain 
your Web site with little or no knowledge of HTML. You can create, modify, 
retrieve, and update your content without ever having to touch the code 
required to perform those tasks.
CMS programs such as WordPress give you the tools and advantages of blog 
software for managing and maintaining your site. These programs make 
setting up a Web site much easier than in the past. Before, if you didn’t 
know HTML, you had to hire a Webmaster to maintain your Web site. With 
WordPress, you can do all that yourself, with or without HTML knowledge. 
That capability translates into a huge cost savings and opens the door to 
anyone who wants to run a Web site but doesn’t have the resources or 
knowledge to do it. Now you can!

298
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
This chapter shows you a few ways that you can use the self-hosted 
WordPress.org software to power your entire Web site, with or without a 
blog. It covers different template configurations that you can use to create 
separate sections of your site. You also discover how to use the front page of 
your site as a landing page (a static page) or portal (a page that contains snip-
pets from other sections of your site, with links to those sections), which can 
include a link to an internal blog page, if you want a blog.
Creating the Front Page of Your Web Site
For the most part, when you visit a blog powered by WordPress, the blog is 
on the main page. My personal blog at http://justagirlintheworld.
com, powered by WordPress (of course), shows my latest blog posts on the 
front page, along with links to the post archives (by month or by category). 
This setup is typical of a site run by WordPress (see Figure 14-1).
But the front page of my business site at http://ewebscapes.com, also 
powered by WordPress, contains no blog (see Figure 14-2). It doesn’t display 
any blog posts; rather, it displays the contents of a static page I created in 
the WordPress Administration panel. This static page serves as a portal to 
my design blog, my portfolio, and other sections of my site. The site includes 
a blog but also serves as a full-blown business Web site, with all the sections I 
need to provide my clients the information they want.
Both of my sites are powered by the self-hosted version of WordPress.org, 
so how can they differ so much in what they display on the front page? The 
answer lies in the templates in the WordPress Administration panel.
You use static pages in WordPress to create content that you don’t want to 
display as part of your blog but do want to display as part of your overall site 
(such as a bio page, a page of services, and so on).
Creating a front page is a three-step process: create a static page, designate 
that static page as the front page of your site, and tweak the page to look like 
a Web site rather than a blog.
 
Using this method, you can create unlimited numbers of static pages to build 
an entire Web site. You don’t even need to have a blog on this site unless you 
want to include one.

Part V: Customizing WordPress  
Creating the static page
To have a static page display on the front page of your site, you need to 
create that page. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add New link on the Pages menu.
 
 The Add New Page page opens where you can write a new page to your 
WordPress blog, as shown in Figure 14-3. (Check out Chapter 7 for the 
difference between a page and a post in WordPress.)
 
2. In the Title text box, type a title for the page.
 
3. Type the content of your page in the text box.
 
4. Set the options for this page.
 
 I explain all these options in Chapter 7.
 
5. Click the Publish button.
 
 The page is saved to your database and published to your WordPress 
site with its own, individual URL (or permalink). The URL for the static 
page consists of your blog URL and the title of the page. For example, if 
you titled your page “About Me,” then the URL of the page is http://
yourdomain.com/about-me. (See Chapter 8 for more information 
about permalinks.)
Note that the Page Template option is set to Default Template. This setting 
tells WordPress that you want to use the default page template (page.php 
in your theme template files) to format the page you’re creating. The default 
template is the default setting for all pages you create; assigning a page to a 
different template is something I discuss in the “Defining specific templates 
for static pages” section in this chapter.
Assigning a static page as the front page
Next, you need to tell WordPress that you want the static page to serve as 
the front page of your site. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Reading link on the Settings menu to display the Reading 
Settings page.
 
2. In the Front Page Displays section, select the A Static Page radio 
button.

301
 Chapter 14: Beyond Blogging: WordPress As a Content Management System
 
3. From the Front Page drop-down menu, choose the static page that you 
want to serve as your front page.
 
 In Figure 14-4, I’m choosing to display a static page, and Welcome to My 
Front Page is the page I want to display.
 
4. Click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the Reading 
Settings page.
 
 WordPress displays the page you selected in Step 3 as the front page of 
your site. Figure 14-5 shows my site displaying the page I created as my 
front page.

Figure 14-5:

Tweaking the layout
With a little adjustment of the code in the page.php (Page) template, you 
can create a front page that doesn’t look like a blog at all. Figure 14-6 shows 
my front page without the usual “bloggy” sidebar containing archive links, 
blogrolls, meta information, and so on.
Chapter 12 covers template tags and templates that you can use in 
WordPress, including setting up static-page templates. However, you can use 
the quick-’n’-dirty method to change your front page from a bloggy-looking 
page to a nonbloggy-looking page using the WordPress Default Theme. Just 
follow these simple steps:
 
1. Click the Editor link on the Appearances menu.
 
 The Edit Themes page opens. All the templates included in the current 
theme are listed on the right side of the page. By default, the Stylesheet 
(style.css) is displayed on the left side of the page in the text box.
 
2. Click Page Template link on the right side of the page.
 
 The Edit Themes page refreshes, with the contents of the page.php 
template displayed in the text box on the left side of the page.

303
 Chapter 14: Beyond Blogging: WordPress As a Content Management System
 
3. Locate this code:
<div id=”content” class=”narrowcolumn”>
 
4. Replace the code in Step 3 with this code:
<div id=”content” class=”widecolumn”>
 
 The widecolumn class changes the formatting of the page content so 
that it is wider in width than the narrowcolumn class.
 
5. Remove the following code, located near the bottom of the page.php 
template:
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>
 
 Removing this piece of code removes the sidebar from the static pages 
on your site. Without this code, the page displays only the content of 
your page.
 
6. Click the Update File button.
 
 The file is saved, and your site is updated with the changes you just made.
Now visit your front page, and you have something that looks similar to 
Figure 14-6. When visitors type your URL in the address bar of their brows-
ers, this front page greets them.

304
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
 
If you want to add a link to your blog (see the next section), add the following 
bit of code to the content of the static page you created for your front-page 
display:
<a href=”/blog”>Please Visit My Blog</a>
Adding a Blog to Your Web Site
If you want a blog on your site but don’t want to display the blog on the front 
page, you can add one with the WordPress Administration panel. To create 
the blog for your site, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Add New link on the Pages menu.
 
 The page where you can write a new post to your WordPress blog 
opens.
 
2. Type Blog in the Title text box.
 
 Doing this automatically sets the page slug to /blog. (Read more about 
slugs in Chapter 8.)
 
3. Leave the Page Content box blank.
 
4. Click the Publish button.
 
 The page is saved to your database and published to your WordPress site.
Now you have a blank page that redirects to http://yourdomain.com/
blog. Next, you need to assign the page you just created as your blog page. 
To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Reading link on the Settings menu to display the Reading 
Settings page.
 
 The Reading Settings page opens.
 
2. From the Posts Page drop-down menu, choose the page you just cre-
ated, as shown in Figure 14-7.
 
 The page is set as your blog page. 
 
3. In the Blog Pages Show at Most section, type the number of posts you 
want to displayed in the Posts text box.
 
 This setting specifies the number of posts you want to display on that 
page at any time. If you enter 5, the blog page shows the last five posts 
you’ve made to your blog.

305
 Chapter 14: Beyond Blogging: WordPress As a Content Management System
 
4. Click the Save Changes button.
 
 The options you just set are saved, and your blog is now at http://
yourdomain.com/blog (where yourdomain.com is the actual 
domain name).
Now when you navigate to http://yourdomain.com/blog, your blog 
displays. Figure 14-8 shows my blog page with two posts.

306
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
 
This method of using the /blog page slug works only if you’re using custom 
permalinks with your WordPress installation. (See Chapter 8 if you want more 
information about permalinks.) If you’re using the default permalinks, the URL 
for your blog page is different; it looks something like http://yourdomain.
com/?p=4 (where 4 is the ID of the page you created for your blog). You can 
find the URL for a page by clicking the Edit link on the Pages menu. Look for 
the page you created for your blog display, and click the View link that 
appears underneath the page title. The page opens in your browser, and you 
can copy the URL from the address bar in your browser and paste it into the 
code used in your static page to provide a link to your blog, like this:
<a href=”http://yourdomain.com/blog”>Please Visit My 
Blog</a>
Defining Specific Templates 
for Static Pages
As I explain in “Creating the Front Page of Your Web Site,” earlier in this 
chapter, a static page contains content that is not displayed on the blog page, 
but as a separate page within your site. You can have numerous static pages 
on your site, and each page can have a different design, which is governed by 
the template you create. (See Chapter 12 to find out all about choosing and 
using templates.) You can create several static-page templates and assign 
them to specific pages within your site by adding code to the top of the 
static-page templates.
Following is the code that appears at the top of the static-page template I 
use for my About Us and Our Blog Designers page at http://ewebscapes.
com/about:
<?php
/*
Template Name: About Page
*/
?>
Using a template on a static page is a two-step process: Upload the template, 
and tell WordPress to use the template by tweaking the page’s code.
 
In Chapter 12, I discuss several different template tags you can use in your tem-
plate. One of those template tags I provide in that chapter is the wp_list_
pages tag. This tag displays a link to all the static pages you’ve created on 
your site so that you can easily display a navigation menu. A navigation menu 
allows your readers to easily locate and read all the content within your site.

307
 Chapter 14: Beyond Blogging: WordPress As a Content Management System
Uploading the template
To use a page template, you have to create one. You can create this file in a 
text-editor program, such as Notepad. (To see how to create a template, flip 
to Chapter 12.) To create an About page, for example, you can name your 
template about.php.
When you have your template created, follow these steps to make it part of 
WordPress:
 
1. Upload the template file to your WordPress theme folder.
 
 You can find that folder on your Web server in /wp-content/themes/. 
(See Chapter 6 for more information about FTP.)
 
2. Log in to your WordPress Administration panel, click the Editor link 
on the Appearance menu.
 
 The Edit Themes page opens.
 
3. Click the about.php template link located on the right side of the page.
 
4. Type the Template Name tag directly above the header template tag.
 
 The header tag looks like this: <?php get_header(); ?>.
 
 If you’re creating an About Page, the code to create the Template Name 
looks like this:
<?php
/*
Template Name: About Page
/*
?>
 
5. Click the Update File button.
 
 The file is saved and the page refreshes. If you created an About Page 
template, the about.php template is now called About Page in the tem-
plate list on the right side of the page.
Figure 14-9 shows the Page template, and displays the code needed to define 
a specific name for the template.
Assigning the template to a static page
When you have the template created and named the way you want it, you 
assign that template to a page by following these steps:

308
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
 
1. Click the Add New link on the Pages menu.
 
 The Add New Page page opens, where you can write a new post to your 
WordPress blog.
 
2. Type the title in the Title text box and the page content in the text box.
 
3. Choose the page template from the Page Template drop-down menu.
 
 The Page Template drop-down menu in the Attributes module by default 
is shown on the right side of the page. You can reposition the modules 
on this page; see Chapter 7 for more information.
 
4. Click the Publish button to save and publish the page to your site.
Figure 14-10 shows the layout of my home page on my business site at 
http://ewebscapes.com and the information it contains, whereas Figure 
14-11 shows the layout and information provided on the FAQ page at http://
ewebscapes.com/faq (using the template named faq.php). Both pages are 
on the same site, in the same WordPress installation, with different static-page 
templates to provide different looks, layouts, and sets of information.

Part V: Customizing WordPress  
Creating a Template for 
Each Post Category
You don’t have to limit yourself to creating a static-page template for your 
site. No, you can completely gorge yourself at the table of WordPress tem-
plates and create unique sections for your site, as I did (with an espresso 
chaser, of course).
Figure 14-12 shows my design portfolio. Design Portfolio is the name of a cat-
egory that I created in the WordPress Administration panel. Instead of using 
a static page for the display of my portfolio, I used a category template to 
handle the display of all posts made to the Design Portfolio category.
You can create category templates for all categories in your blog simply by 
creating template files with filenames that correspond to the category ID 
numbers and then uploading those templates to your WordPress themes 
directory (see Chapter 12). The logic to this is as follows:
 
Figure 14-12: 
My Design 
Portfolio

a category 
template file.
 

311
 Chapter 14: Beyond Blogging: WordPress As a Content Management System
 
✓ A template with the filename category.php is a catch-all for the 
display of categories.
 
✓ Add a dash and the category ID number to the end of the filename (as 
shown in Table 14-1) to specify a template for an individual category.
 
✓ If you don’t have a category.php or category-#.php file, the 
category display pulls from the Main Index template (index.php).
Table 14-1 shows three examples of the category template naming 
requirements.

The Category Template Filename Is . . .

Pulling in Content from 
a Single Category
WordPress makes it possible to pull in very specific types of content on your 
Web site through the <query_posts> template tag. You place this template 
tag before The Loop (see Chapter 12), and it lets you specify which category 
you want to pull information from. If you have a category called WordPress, 
and you want to display the last three posts from that category on your front 
page, in your blog sidebar, or somewhere else on your site, you can use this 
template tag.
 
The <query_posts> template tag has several parameters that let you display 
different types of content, such as posts in specific categories and content 
from specific pages/posts or dates in your blog archives. The <query_
posts> tag lets you pass so many variables and parameters that it’s impos-
sible for me to list all the possibilities. Instead, you can visit this page in the 
WordPress Codex and read about the options available with this tag: http://
codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/query_posts.
First, you have to find the ID number for the category you want to use; then 
you have to tell WordPress how to display the content with the <query_
posts> tag.

312
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
Finding the category ID number
The unique ID number for a category is not easy to find unless you know 
where to look. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Categories link on the Posts menu. 
 
 The Categories page opens.
 
2. Hover your mouse over the name of the category that you need the ID 
number for.
 
3. Look in the status bar of your browser to view the category ID 
number.
 
 Figure 14-13 shows the category ID in the status bar of Mozilla Firefox. 
(Internet Explorer and Safari have similar status bars.) The last part of 
the URL displayed in the status bar is cat_ID=6, which means that 40 is 
the category ID for my WordPress category.

313
 Chapter 14: Beyond Blogging: WordPress As a Content Management System
Adding the <query_post> tag
When you have the category ID number in hand, you’re ready to add the 
<query_post> tag to your template.
Here is an example of two parameters you can use with the <query_
posts> tag:
 
✓ showposts=X: This parameter tells WordPress how many posts 
you want to display. If you want to display only three posts, enter 
showposts=3.
 
✓ cat=X: This parameter tells WordPress that you want to pull posts from 
the category with this specific ID number. If the ID category is 40, enter 
cat=40.
Follow these steps to add the <query_post> tag to your template:
 
1. Click the Editor link on the Appearance menu.
 
 The Edit Themes page opens.
 
2. Click the template in which you want to display the content.
 
 If you want to display content in a sidebar, for example, choose the 
Sidebar template: sidebar.php.
 
3. Locate the ending </ul> tag at the bottom of the template for the 
theme you’re using.
 
 If you’re using the Kubrick theme, the ending </ul> tag is the second-to-
the-last line.
 
4. Type the following code directly above the ending </ul> tag:
<?php query_posts(‘showposts=3&cat=40’); ?>
<h2>Type Your Desired Title Here</h2>
<?php if (have_posts()) : ?>
<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
<strong><a href=”<?php the_permalink() ?>” 
rel=”bookmark” title=”Permanent Link to <?php 
the_title_attribute(); ?>”><?php the_title(); 
?></a></strong>
<?php the_excerpt(); ?>
<?php endwhile; ?>
<?php endif; ?>
 
 In the first line, I indicated the following: showposts=3&cat=40. You 
can change these numbers to suit your specific needs. Just change 3 to 
whatever number of posts you’d like to display (there is no limit!), and 
change 40 to the specific category ID number that you want to use.

314

5. Click the Update File button.
 
 The changes you just made are saved to the sidebar.php template.

WordPress Posts, displaying three posts from my WordPress category with 
titles and post excerpts.

Using Sidebar Templates
You can create separate sidebar templates for different pages of your site by 
using a simple include statement. When you write an include statement, 
you’re simply telling WordPress that you want it to include a specific file on a 
specific page.
The code that pulls the usual Sidebar template (sidebar.php) into all the 
other templates, such as the Main Index template (index.php), looks like this:
<?php get_sidebar(); ?>

315
 Chapter 14: Beyond Blogging: WordPress As a Content Management System
What if you create a page and want to use a sidebar that has different infor-
mation from what you have in the Sidebar template (sidebar.php)? Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Create a new sidebar template in a text editor such as Notepad.
 
 See Chapter 12 for information on template tags and themes.
 
2. Save the file as sidebar2.php.
 
 In Notepad, choose File➪Save. When you’re asked to name the file, type 
sidebar2.php and then click Save.
 
3. Upload sidebar2.php to your themes folder on your Web server.
 
 See Chapter 6 for FTP information, and review Chapter 12 for informa-
tion on how to locate the themes folder.
 
 The template is now listed in your theme files on the Edit Themes page 
(log in to your WordPress Administration panel, click the Editor link on 
the Appearance menu).
 
4. To include the sidebar2.php template in one of your page templates, 
find this code:
<?php get_sidebar(); />
 
5. Replace it with this include code:
<?php include (TEMPLATEPATH . ‘/sidebar2.php’); ?>
 
Using that include (TEMPLATEPATH statement, you can include virtually 
any file in any of your WordPress templates. You can use this method to 
create footer templates for pages on your site, for example. To do this, first 
create a new template with the filename footer2.php. Then locate the fol-
lowing code in your template:
<?php get_footer(); ?>
and replace it with this code:
<?php include (TEMPLATEPATH . ‘/footer2.php’); ?>
You can do multiple things with WordPress to extend it beyond the blog. 
This chapter gives you a few practical examples using the default Kubrick 
theme. The point is to show you how to use WordPress to create a fully func-
tional Web site with a CMS platform — anything from the smallest personal 
site to a large business site.

Part V: Customizing WordPress  
Custom Styles for Sticky, Category, 
and Tag Posts
In Chapter 12, I discussed the method of putting a very basic WordPress 
theme together, which included a Main Index template using the WordPress 
Loop. You can use a custom tag to display custom styles for sticky posts, cat-
egories, and tags on your blog. That special tag looks like this:
<div <?php post_class() ?> id=”post-<?php the_ID(); ?>”>
The part of that template tag that is so cool is the post_class() section. 
This template tag tells WordPress to insert specific HTML markup in your 
template that allow you to use CSS to make custom styles for sticky posts, 
categories, and tags.
 
In Chapter 8, I tell you all about how to publish new posts to your blog, includ-
ing the different options you can set for your blog posts, such as categories, 
tags, and publishing settings. One of the settings is the Stick This Post to the 
Front Page setting. In this chapter, I show you how to custom style those 
sticky posts — it’s not as messy as it sounds!
For example, I have published a post with the following options set for 
that post:
 
✓ Stick this post to the front page
 
✓ Filed in a category called WordPress
 
✓ Tagged with News
By having the post_class() tag in my template, WordPress inserts HTML 
markup that allows me to use CSS to style sticky posts, or posts assigned 
to specific tags or categories, differently. WordPress inserted the following 
HTML markup for my post:
<div class=”post sticky category-wordpress tag-news”>
In Chapter 13, I talk about CSS selectors and HTML markup and how they 
work together to create style and format for your WordPress theme. I can 
now go to my CSS file and define styles for the following CSS selectors:
 
✓ .post: Use this as the generic style for all posts on your blog. The CSS for 
this tag is
.post {background: #ffffff; border: 1px solid silver; 
padding: 10px;}

317
 Chapter 14: Beyond Blogging: WordPress As a Content Management System
 
 A style is created for all posts that have a white background with a thin 
silver border and 10 pixels of padding space between the post text and 
the border of the post.
 
✓ .sticky: The concept of sticking a post to your front page is to call atten-
tion to that post, so you might want to use different CSS styling to make 
it stand out from the rest of the posts on your blog:
.sticky {background: #ffffff; border: 4px solid red; 
padding: 10px;}
 
 This creates a style for all sticky posts that display with a white back-
ground, a thicker red border, and 10 pixels of padding space between 
the post text and border of the post.
 
✓ .category—wordpress: Because I blog a lot about WordPress, my read-
ers may appreciate it if I gave them a visual cue as to which posts on my 
blog are about that topic. I can do that through CSS by telling WordPress 
to display a small WordPress icon on the top right corner of all my posts 
in the WordPress category:
.category-wordpress {background: url(wordpress-icon.
jpg) top right no-repeat; height: 100px; 
width: 100px;}
 
 This code inserts a graphic — wordpress-icon.jpg — that is 100 
pixels in height and 100 pixels in width at the top right corner of every 
post I’ve assigned to the WordPress category on my blog.
 
✓ .tag—news: I can style all posts tagged with News the same way I’ve 
styled the categories:
.tag-news {background: #f2f2f2; border: 1px solid 
black; padding: 10px;}
 
 This CSS styles all posts tagged with News with a light grey background 
and a thin black border with 10 pixels of padding between the post text 
and border of the post.
Using the post-class() tag, combined with CSS, to create dynamic styles for 
the posts on your blog is fun and easy!
Optimizing Your WordPress Blog
Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of preparing your site to 
make it as easy as possible for the major search engines to crawl your site 
and cache your data in their systems so that your site appears as high as 
possible in the search returns.

318
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
If you visit Google’s search engine page at http://google.com and 
do a search using the keywords WordPress blog design, my own site at 
E.Webscapes is in the top five search results for those keywords (at least, 
it is as I’m writing this chapter). Those results can change from day to day, 
so by the time you read this book, someone else may very well have taken 
over that coveted position. The reality of chasing those high-ranking search 
engine positions is that they’re here today, gone tomorrow. 
The goal of search engine optimization is to make sure that your site ranks 
as high as possible for the keywords that you think people will use to find 
your site. After you attain those high-ranking positions, the next goal is to 
keep them. Check out Search Engine Optimization For Dummies, by Peter Kent 
(Wiley Publishing) for some valuable information on keeping those high rank-
ings through ongoing optimization of your site.
WordPress is equipped to create an environment that is friendly to search 
engines, giving them easy navigation through your archives, categories, and 
pages. This environment is provided by a clean code base, content that is easily 
updated through the WordPress interface, and a solid navigation structure.
To extend search engine optimization even further, you can tweak five ele-
ments of your WordPress posts, pages, and templates:
 
✓ Custom permalinks: Use custom permalinks, rather than the default 
WordPress permalinks, to fill your post and page URLs with valuable key-
words. Check out Chapter 8 for information on WordPress permalinks.
 
✓ Posts and page titles: Create descriptive titles for your blog posts and 
pages to provide rich keywords in your site.
 
✓ Text: Fill your blog posts and pages with keywords for search engines to 
find and index. Keeping your site updated with descriptive text and phrases 
helps the search engines find keywords to associate with your site.
 
✓ Category names: Use descriptive names for the categories you create in 
WordPress to place great keywords right in the URL for those category 
pages, if you use custom permalinks.
 
✓ Images and ALT tags: Place <ALT> tags in your images to further define 
and describe the images on your site. You can accomplish this task 
easily by using the description field in the WordPress image uploader.
Planting keywords in your Web site
If you’re interested in a higher ranking for your site, I strongly recommend 
using custom permalinks. By using custom permalinks, you’re automatically 
inserting keywords into the URLs of your posts and pages, letting search 

319
 Chapter 14: Beyond Blogging: WordPress As a Content Management System
engines include those posts and pages in their databases of information on 
those topics. If your site is hosted by a provider that has the Apache mod_
rewrite module enabled, you can use the custom permalink structure for 
your WordPress-powered site.
Keywords are the first step on your journey toward great search engine 
results. Search engines are dependent on keywords, and people use key-
words to look for content.
The default permalink structure in WordPress is pretty ugly. When you’re look-
ing at the default permalink for any post, you see a URL something like this:
http://yourdomain.com/p?=105
This URL contains no keywords of worth. If you change to a custom perma-
link structure, your post URLs automatically include the titles of your posts 
to provide keywords, which search engines absolutely love. A custom perma-
link might appear in this format:
http://yourdomain.com/2007/02/01/your-post-title
I explain setting up and using custom permalinks in full detail in Chapter 8.
Optimizing your post titles 
for search engine success
Search engine optimization isn’t completely dependent on how you set your 
site up. It’s also dependent on you, the site owner, and how you present your 
content.
One way to present your content in a way that lets search engines catalog 
your site easily is to give your blog posts and pages titles that make sense 
and coordinate with the actual content being presented. If you’re doing a 
post on a certain topic, make sure that the title of the post contains at least 
one or two keywords about that particular topic. This practice gives the 
search engines even more ammunition to list your site in searches relevant 
to the topic of your post.
 
As your site’s presence in the search engines grows, more people will find 
your site, and your readership will increase as a result.
A blog post with the title A Book I’m Reading isn’t going to tell anyone what 
book it is, making it difficult for people searching for information on that par-
ticular book to find the post.

320
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
If you give the post the title WordPress For Dummies: My Review, you 
provide keywords in the title, and (if you’re using custom permalinks) 
WordPress automatically inserts those keywords into the URL, giving the 
search engines a triple keyword play:
 
✓ Keywords exist in your blog post title.
 
✓ Keywords exist in your blog post URL.
 
✓ Keywords exist in the content of your post.
Writing content with readers in mind
When you write your posts and pages, and want to make sure that your con-
tent appears in the first page of search results so that people will find your site, 
you need to keep those people in mind when you’re composing the content.
When search engines visit your site to crawl through your content, they 
aren’t seeing how nicely designed your site is. What they’re looking for are 
words — which they’re grabbing to include in their databases. You, the 
site owner, want to make sure that your posts and pages use the words and 
phrases that you want to include in search engines.
If your post is about a recipe for fried green tomatoes, for example, you need 
to add a keyword or phrase that you think people will use when they search 
for the topic. If you think people would use the phrase recipe for fried green 
tomatoes as a search term, you may want to include that phrase in the con-
tent and title of your post.
A title such as A Recipe I Like isn’t as effective as a title such as A Recipe for 
Fried Green Tomatoes, right? Including it in your post or page content gives 
the search engines a double keyword whammy.
Here’s another example: I once wrote a post about a rash that I developed 
on my finger, under my ring. I wrote that post well over a year ago, not 
really meaning to attract a bunch of people to that particular post. However, 
it seems that many women around the world suffer from the same rash, 
because a year later, that post still gets at least one comment a week. When 
people do a Google search using the keywords rash under my wedding ring, 
out of a possible 743,000 results returned, my blog post appears in the num-
ber-one slot, as shown in Figure 14-15.

321
 Chapter 14: Beyond Blogging: WordPress As a Content Management System
 
Figure 14-15: 
My blog 
post on 
ring-finger 
rash hits the 
number-
one position 
in Google.
 
This is how great blogs are! I was actually able to solve my problem with 
the rash under my finger because one woman from Australia found my blog 
through Google, visited my blog post, and left a comment with a solution that 
worked. Who says blogs aren’t useful?
Creating categories that 
attract search engines
One little-known SEO tip for WordPress users: The names you give the cate-
gories you’ve created for your blog provide rich keywords that attract search 
engines like bees to honey. A few services — Technorati.com being one of the 
biggest — treat categories in WordPress like tags. These services use those 
categories to classify recent blog posts on any given topic. The names you 
give your categories in WordPress can serve as topic tags for Technorati and 
similar services.
Search engines also see your categories as keywords that are relevant to the 
content on your site. In this regard, it’s important to make sure that you’re 
giving your categories names that are relevant to the content you’re provid-
ing on your site.

322
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
If you sometimes blog about your favorite recipes, you can make it easier for 
search engines to find your recipes if you create categories specific to the 
recipes you’re blogging about. Instead of having one Favorite Recipes cate-
gory, you can create multiple category names that correspond to the types of 
recipes you blog about — Casserole Recipes, Dessert Recipes, Beef Recipes, 
and Chicken Recipes, for example.
 
Creating specific category titles not only helps search engines, but also helps 
your readers.
You can also consider having one category called Favorite Recipes and cre-
ating subcategories (also known as child categories) that give a few more 
details on the types of recipes you’ve written about. (See Chapter 8 for infor-
mation on creating categories and child categories.)
Categories use the custom permalink structure as well. So links to your 
WordPress categories also become keyword tools within your site to help 
the search engines — and ultimately, search engine users — find the content. 
Using custom permalinks gives you category page URLs that look something 
like this:
http://yourdomain.com/category/Category_Name
The Category_Name portion of that URL puts the keywords right into the 
hands of search engines.
Using the <ALT> tag for images
When you use the WordPress image uploader to include an image in your 
post or page, you’re given a Description text box in which you can enter a 
description of the image. (I cover using the WordPress image uploader in 
detail in Chapter 9.) This text automatically becomes what is referred to as 
the <ALT> tag.
The <ALT> tag’s real purpose is to provide a description of the image for 
people who, for some reason or another, can’t actually see the image. In a 
text-based browser that doesn’t display images, for example, visitors see the 
description, or <ALT> text, telling them what image would be there if they 
could see it. Also, the tag helps people with impaired vision who rely on 
screen-reading technology, because the screen reader reads the <ALT> text 
from the image. You can read more about Web site accessibility for people 
with disabilities at www.w3.org/WAI/References/Browsing.

323
 Chapter 14: Beyond Blogging: WordPress As a Content Management System
An extra benefit of <ALT> tags is that search engines gather data from them 
to further classify the content of your site. The following is the code for 
inserting an image, with the <ALT> tag of the code in bold to demonstrate 
what I’m talking about:
<img src=”http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg” alt=”This is an 
ALT tag within an image” />
Search engines harvest those <ALT> tags as keywords. The WordPress image 
uploader gives you an easy way to include those <ALT> tags without having 
to worry about inserting them into the image code yourself. Just fill out the 
Description text box before you upload and add the image to your post. 
Figure 14-16 shows the Description text box that accompanies the WordPress 
image uploader.

box to add 
ALT tags to

Deciding to Bring in the Pros
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring professional services
▶ Finding a professional who can accommodate your needs
▶ Keeping the communication lines open
F
or some people, hiring a professional is a solution — and sometimes, 
the only viable solution — for creating a blog that’s different from all the 
rest. Let’s face it — some folks would rather chew on nails than try to figure 
out all the template tags, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) rules, and graphic 
design techniques it takes to create a custom-made WordPress template. 
I hear it from WordPress users (and other blogging-platform users) all the 
time: “I want a unique look, but I don’t know how to do it. I just want to blog.”
The question for you to answer is whether you’ll be completely satisfied by 
using a free theme available for all WordPress users, or whether you prefer 
to hire a professional to provide you a custom theme. Chapter 11 shows 
you how to find and install free themes that are available to all users of the 
WordPress.org platform, and Chapter 13 gives you details on how to tweak 
a free theme. If all this theme information is something you’d rather avoid, 
however, this chapter gives you information on hiring a professional to help 
you with the design details. The chapter also covers other types of blog pro-
fessionals, such as developers and consultants.
Checking Out the Types 
of Blog Professionals
You have big plans for your blog, and your time is valuable. Hiring a profes-
sional to handle the back-end design and maintenance of your blog enables 
you to spend your time creating the content and building your readership on 
the front end.

326
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
Many bloggers who decide to go the custom route by hiring a design profes-
sional do it for another reason: They want the designs/themes of their blogs 
to be unique. Free themes are nice, but you do run the risk that your blog will 
look just like hundreds of other blogs out there.
Branding, a term often used in advertising and marketing, refers to the rec-
ognizable identity of a product — in this case, of your blog. Having a unique 
brand or design for your site sets yours apart from the rest. If your blog has 
a custom look, people will begin to associate that look with you. You can 
accomplish branding with a single logo or an entire layout and color scheme 
of your choosing.
Many consultants and design professionals put themselves up for hire. Who 
are these people? I get to that topic in just a second. First, you want to under-
stand what services they offer, which can help you decide whether hiring a 
professional is the solution for you.
Take a look at some of the many services available:
 
✓ Custom graphic design and CSS styling for your blog
 
✓ Custom templates
 
✓ WordPress plugin installation and integration
 
✓ Custom WordPress plugins
 
✓ WordPress software installation on your Web server
 
✓ Upgrades of the WordPress software
 
✓ Web hosting and domain registration services
 
✓ Search engine optimization and site marketing
 
Some bloggers take advantage of the full array of services provided, whereas 
others use only a handful. The important thing to remember is that you aren’t 
alone. Help is available for you and your blog.
In Table 15-1, I pair the three types of blog experts — designers, developers, 
and consultants — with the services they typically offer.
Many of these folks are freelancers with self-imposed titles, but I’ve matched 
titles to duties as best I can. Keep in mind that some of these professionals 
wear all these hats and are jacks (or jills)-of-all-trades, whereas others spe-
cialize in one area.

327
 Chapter 15: Deciding to Bring in the Pros
Table 15-1 
Types of WordPress Professionals
Title
Services
Designers
These folks excel in graphic design, CSS, and the development of 
custom templates.
Developers
These guys and gals are code monkeys. Some of them don’t know 
a stitch about design; however, they can provide you custom code 
to make your blog do things you never thought possible. Usually, 
you’ll find these people releasing plugins in their spare time for the 
WordPress community to use for free.
Consultants
If you’re blogging for a business, these folks can provide you a 
marketing plan for your blog or a plan for using your blog to reach 
clients and colleagues in your field. Many of these consultants also 
provide search engine optimization to help your domain reach high 
ranks in search engines.
I wish I could tell you what price to expect to pay for any type of consultant. 
Truth is, there’s no real way for me to make an “On average, you can expect 
to pay” statement because levels of expertise vary so wildly. I have seen 
these services range anywhere from $5 per hour all the way up to $300 per 
hour — and all points in between and beyond.
 
As with any purchase, do your research, and make an informed decision 
before you buy. That advice is the absolute best I can give.
Listing all the professionals who provide WordPress services is impossible, 
but I do list some of the most popular ones in Tables 15-2 through 15-4. My 
goal is to cover a diverse level of services so that you have the knowledge to 
make an informed decision about which professional to choose.
Designers
Blog designers can take a simple blog and turn it into something dynamic 
and exciting. These people are experts in the graphic design, CSS styling, 
and template tagging needed to create your working theme. Most often, blog 
designers are also skilled in installing and upgrading WordPress software and 
plugins; sometimes, they’re even skilled in creating custom PHP or plugins. 
These folks are the ones you want to contact when you’re looking for some-
one to create a nice custom design for your blog (see Figure 15-1).

basis because every project is unique. When you’re searching for a blog 
designer, if the prices are not displayed on the site, feel free to drop the 
designer an e-mail and ask for an estimate. Armed with this information, 
you can do a little comparison-shopping while you search for just the right 
designer.
The designers and design studios listed in Table 15-2 represent a range of

Developers
The WordPress motto sits at the bottom of the WordPress home page:
Code is poetry.
And no one knows this better than the extremely talented blog developers out 
there today, including the members of the core WordPress development team. 
A developer can take some of the underlying code, make a little magic happen 
between PHP and the MySQL database that stores the content of your blog, 
and create a dynamic display of that content for you. Most likely, you will con-
tact a developer when you want to do something with your blog that is a little 
out of the ordinary, and you can’t find a plugin that does the trick.
If you’ve gone through all the available WordPress plugins and still can’t find 
the exact function that you want your WordPress blog to perform, get hold 
of one of these folks. Explain what you need. The developer can tell whether 
it can be done, whether she is available to do it, and how much it will cost 
(don’t forget that part!). You may recognize some of the names in Table 15-3 
as the developers/authors of some popular WordPress plugins.

Consultants
Blog consultants may not be able to do any design or coding work for your 
blog, but they’re probably connected to people who can. Consultants can 
help you achieve your goals for your blog in terms of online visibility, market-
ing plans, and search engine optimization. Most of these folks can help you 
find out how to make money with your blog and connect you with various 
advertising programs. Quite honestly, you can do what blog consultants do 
by investing just a little time and research in these areas. As with design and 
coding, however, figuring everything out and then implementing it takes time. 
Sometimes, it’s easier — and more cost effective — to hire a professional 
than to do it yourself.

Who hires blog consultants? Typically, a business that wants to incorporate a

Hiring a Professional
With the growing popularity of WordPress, you and I are treated to an ever-
expanding market of WordPress consultants, developers, and designers. This 
situation is an extremely good thing, because the competition keeps them 
sharp and gives us a wide variety of choices. This section provides informa-
tion on how to find, hire, and communicate with professionals who make 
WordPress magic happen.
Finding professionals
Search engines are the most obvious tools to use to look for blog designers, 
developers, and consultants. By entering the applicable keywords in the 
search engines, you can find professionals who provide the services you 
seek. I suggest using keywords like these:
 
✓ Blog consultant
 
✓ Blog designer
 
✓ WordPress designer
 
✓ WordPress developer
 
✓ Custom WordPress themes
Aside from search engines, here are some other places you can find blog 
professionals:

331
 Chapter 15: Deciding to Bring in the Pros
 
✓ Other blogs: Word of mouth is probably the best testimonial when it 
comes to the services and skills of a group or individual. If you visit 
blogs on a regular basis, you may notice that bloggers who paid for 
custom design, development, or marketing services usually display links 
to the Web sites of the professionals they used and are more than happy 
to talk about their project details.
 
 When you see a custom blog that you really like, drop the blogger an e-mail 
and ask about it, or visit the Web site of the professional the blogger used.
 
✓ WordPress support forums (http://wordpress.org/support): 
You can find many WordPress experts hanging out in these forums, 
and some of them are available for hire. At the very least, people in the 
forums can provide great recommendations.
 
 These forums are communities of people from all walks of life, ranging 
from novices to experts. Check the credentials of anyone you find in the 
forums, of course, to make sure that he has the experience and knowl-
edge to do what you’re asking for.
 
✓ WordPress Theme Directory (http://wordpress.org/extend/
themes): The designers who provide free themes for the WordPress com-
munity often hire themselves out for custom projects as well. If you see 
and like some work by a particular designer on this site, consider drop-
ping that designer an e-mail to find out whether she is available for hire.
 
✓ Automattic Web site (http://automattic.com/services/word
press-consultants): The folks at Automattic created Akismet and 
sidebar widgets, and they’re some of the original developers of the 
WordPress software. They provide a list of qualified WordPress design 
and development consultants, with each listing linked to that profes-
sional’s or company’s site.
Auditioning your prospects
There are hundreds of designers, consultants, and developers on the Web 
today, each with his or her own style and skill. There is, literally, something 
for everyone.
Here are some questions to keep in mind when deciding on the professional 
you want to work with:
 
✓ Does he have any experience working with WordPress?
 
✓ How much experience does she have?
 
✓ Does his skill encompass just one aspect of what you’re looking for, or will 
you have to hire more than one professional to get the entire job done?

332
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
This section helps you evaluate the credentials and skills of various profes-
sionals so that you can decide which one to hire for your project.
Blog design practices: What to look for
As a consumer, you should have certain expectations when hiring a profes-
sional to design and develop your project. Before paying any amount of 
money for a professional, make sure that person is as skilled as you need 
her to be. Keep one very important point in mind: As with anything else 
in life, you get what you pay for. You wouldn’t pay for a Ford and expect a 
Mercedes, right?
The blog-designing industry has a few standards that you should expect any 
professional that you hire to meet. If the designer you’re considering can’t 
meet these basic standards, I recommend moving on until you find one who 
can. I’m not trying to criticize anyone here; I’ve just been on the receiving 
end of some projects that didn’t meet these basic standards. And in keeping 
with my previous car-buying analogy, if you don’t get things right the first 
time, this lemon will nickel-and-dime you to death — either in money or time 
investment — for months or even years. Make sure that the person you hire 
is skilled in the following areas:
 
✓ XHTML validation: Web sites are built with programming languages, such 
as HTML. XHTML validation is kind of like spell-checking or grammar-
checking the HTML code against a set of standards put in place by the 
World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). When your site validates, it’s easier 
for all types of browsers to read and display the underlying code that is 
the foundation of the design.
 
 The easiest way to see whether a Web site or blog validates is to use 
W3C’s validation service at http://validator.w3.org.
 
 You can’t always gauge a designer’s expertise in XHTML validation 
simply by visiting the sites she has designed. It’s very easy for anyone 
who has administrator access to break the validation (causing the site 
to have errors in XHTML validation) with just a few simple keystrokes. 
When a designer hands a project to a client, it’s possible for the client to 
do something, either within the code or within the content of the site, to 
break XHTML validation.
 
 You can find a great deal more information about XHTML validation on 
the W3C Web site at www.w3.org/QA/Tools.
 
✓ CSS-based designs: The expected standard for Web site and blog design 
today is making sure that the design is CSS based, which means that the 
format and layout of the site are powered by Cascading Style Sheets. 
(Other methods include inline styles, which are written inside the code 
rather than pulled in from CSS, and table-based designs, which don’t render 
or display as well as CSS-based designs do.) CSS-based sites also have less 
code bloat, meaning that the code contained within the pages is light and 
the markup lean — something that search engines will love you for!

333
 Chapter 15: Deciding to Bring in the Pros
 
 The easiest way to tell whether a designer used table-based design 
techniques with inline styling is to look at some of the other sites he’s 
designed. (Usually, you can find examples in the portfolio or gallery sec-
tion of the designer’s site.) View a few sites this person has designed, 
and then view the HTML source of each site (right-click in the browser 
window and choose View Source). Designs created with tables and inline 
styles usually have code that looks something like this:
<table width=“100%” border=“0” cellspacing=“0” cellpadding=“0” 
background=“#ffffff”>
 
 Instead of using tables and inline styling, a designer can achieve the 
same results with CSS, which provides a better browsing experience for 
your visitors.
 
✓ Cross-browser rendering: Multiple browsers are available today, includ-
ing Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Netscape, and Safari. Each 
browser has its own way of rendering code and CSS. Internet Explorer is 
especially unique in the way it renders CSS, which creates a bit of a chal-
lenge from a design standpoint, because a site needs to look the same in 
Internet Explorer as it does in all other browsers.
 
 As a blog owner, you want your site to display correctly for all visitors. 
Every professional designer should be able to accomplish cross-browser 
rendering, but it is always best to ask and not make any assumptions.
Looking at the pro’s virtual résumé
Before you contact a blogging professional to help with your blog, you can 
find out some pertinent information about who she is, what she does, and 
what her style is. A little planning and research can go a long way in helping 
ensure that you’re finding a good fit for your project.
Usually, you can find a portfolio for the professional you’re considering on 
his Web site. When you get to the professional’s site, look for links labeled 
something like Portfolio, Gallery, or Clients.
You can get a good feel for the blogging professional’s style and design abili-
ties by browsing through her portfolio of projects. If looking at the portfolio 
causes you to run screaming from the computer monitor, it’s a good bet that 
this particular professional isn’t the one for you. Keep browsing until you 
find one who’s done some design work that you really admire.
Browsing through a blogging professional’s portfolio should give you an idea 
about whether that person has experience working with the WordPress soft-
ware. If that seems to be the case, keep reading; you’ll likely find a wealth of 
information about the services he offers by looking a bit deeper on the site.
When you’re looking at a blogging professional’s Web site, determine what 
standards are most important to that person by trying to find out whether 
she does the following:

334
Part V: Customizing WordPress  
 
✓ Develops XTHML-valid code and provides nice graphic design.
 
✓ Ensures that the product provided renders properly in all browser sys-
tems. (If you see excuses about why the product renders in only one 
browser, move on.)
 
✓ Provides the services you need. (Can all your project needs — domain 
registration, Web hosting, design work, and software setup and 
upgrades — be met under one roof?)
 
While you’re on the blogging professional’s Web site, make a note of some 
client URLs, and then visit those sites. Get in contact with these clients, and 
find out what kind of experiences they had with the professional you’re con-
sidering. You may want to contact multiple clients to get a good sampling of 
client satisfaction. Don’t have a lot of time for this task? Professional blogging 
designers, developers, and consultants often post client testimonials right on 
their Web sites for you to read, although solely relying on published testimo-
nials gives you only one side of the story. Make sure that you contact other 
clients to get further information on the professional’s client relations.
Another way to find more information is to do a Google search on the individ-
ual or company name. Type the name in Google’s search engine to find out 
what people are saying on their sites about the professional you’re looking 
to do business with. Usually, bloggers write about their experiences, good or 
bad, with vendors they’ve worked with.
Making contact
When you’ve narrowed your list of candidates, drop them all e-mails with your 
questions. Be as specific as possible about your needs. Designers and develop-
ers can do a lot of things, but I have yet to meet one who can read minds.
Sending an e-mail that says, for example, “I need my blog designed. How 
much would you charge?” is less effective than something like this:
“I’m looking for a professional who can create a custom design for my blog.
You can find my blog at www.yourdomain.com [enter your URL].
I’m looking for a new template with a three-column layout done in shades of 
dark and light blue.
The new design must accommodate all my current content and advertising.
In addition to my current content, I have an image that I’d like to include on 
my blog (which I can send to you when needed). I also need recommenda-
tions on plugins.”
An e-mail structured like this gives the professional a much better idea of 
what you’re seeking.

335
 Chapter 15: Deciding to Bring in the Pros
In return, e-mails from the person you’re thinking about hiring should tell you 
what to expect in terms of price and when you can expect the project to be 
completed, and he should answer any questions you’ve posed.
These professionals all have their own ways of getting from point A to point 
B in terms of communication. Some communicate via e-mail, some via phone, 
and some via online help desks. Whichever method a professional uses, open 
communication is the key. You fully expect your professional to communi-
cate with you; do her the return favor of giving her your ideas and identifying 
the aspects of your blog that you think are vital and important. A relationship 
with a good professional can be one that lasts a lifetime — or, at the very 
least, for the lifetime of your blog.
Agreeing on the contract
When you have chosen the professional you want to work with, the next 
step is a contract — the agreement between you and the professional — that 
states what you can expect from each other.
A professional may fax a paper contract to you to sign. Some professionals, 
however, use virtual agreements, in which all the details of the project are 
agreed on either through e-mail or through an online form that you fill out. 
The decision is yours as to which format you are more comfortable with.
At the very least, the contract (or agreement) should contain the following 
information:
 
✓ Price and payment schedule: The price that you and the professional 
have agreed on, and when and how payments will be made.
 
✓ Completion date: The date when you and the professional expect the 
project to be finished.
 
✓ Project delivery: The method that the professional will use to deliver 
the completed project to you. Delivery may be in the form of electronic 
transfer via e-mail, project materials published to your Web site, or proj-
ect materials provided on CD-ROM or DVD.
 
✓ Project details: The specifics of the services you can expect the profes-
sional to provide. If the project is a design project, the details usually 
include specifications of the design work. If you’re hiring someone to 
handle marketing services, the professional should detail the services 
to be performed, such as developing a marketing plan, advertising, and 
search engine submission.
 
I’m not a lawyer. The information I’ve provided here is very general, focusing 
on the key elements that any contract or agreement should include. Be sure to 
consult an attorney for specific legal advice concerning contracts.

The Par t of Tens

In this part . . .
W
elcome to The Part of Tens! In this part, I tell you 
about ten fabulous WordPress themes and ten 
great plugins that you can use to enhance your WordPress 
blogging. I also present ten WordPress–powered sites that 
effectively use WordPress as a CMS (Content Management 
System).

Chapter 16
Ten WordPress Web Sites 
Used As a CMS
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing examples of how WordPress powers Web sites
▶ Discovering sites that use WordPress for more than just blogging
S
o many blogs, so little time! This chapter focuses on ten successful blogs 
that use the WordPress software in effective, innovative, and inspiring 
ways. These blogs go beyond what the WordPress software has to offer out 
of the box, extending WordPress to present a unique experience for visitors.
I’m not talking just about design in this case. A tremendous number of well-
designed WordPress blogs are floating around the blogosphere; picking only 
ten of them would be a near-impossible task for me. No, what I’m talking 
about here is how each individual site is set up. Sometimes, you can look at 
a Web site and not even know that it’s a blog or a site built with blog soft-
ware. This is why people refer to WordPress as a CMS (Content Management 
System), rather than merely a blogging platform. You can do much more with 
it than just blog; you can also build fully functional Web sites with it.
 
The sites in this chapter employ techniques that could be considered 
“advanced WordPress hackery.” These techniques aren’t necessarily the kinds 
that you can perform straight out of the starting gate. Chapters 11, 12, and 13 
deal with WordPress themes, templates and template tags, introducing the 
basic techniques to get you started.
New Music Nation
http://newmusicnation.com
At first glance, many visitors to New Music Nation comment that if it weren’t 
for the credit link at the bottom of the site pages, they wouldn’t think that the 
site was built with the WordPress blogging platform.

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
New Music Nation is an up-and-coming music review site owned and oper-
ated by Dave Powers, the former producer of MTV2’s “Subterranean,” “120 
Minutes,” “Hip Hop’s Toughest Rhymes,” and “Playlistism,” to name just a 
few accomplishments of this music blogger. Dave really did his research 
before starting New Music Nation.
I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work with Dave on rebuilding his 
static HTML site from the ground up with the use of WordPress. He came to 
me with his idea to add a fairly intensive category navigation system through-
out his site. New Music Nation has roughly 1,800 categories (and growing), 
which was a challenging problem when it came to creating a workable naviga-
tion system for his readers.
What type of category navigation does the site provide for its visitors?
 
✓ A search of one particular category by month: This feature, which isn’t 
a default feature of WordPress, required some custom PHP coding and 
queries to the MySQL database. This navigation method isn’t recom-
mended if you’re not a code monkey, but I highlight it here as an exam-
ple of what is possible due to the extensive nature of WordPress.
 
✓ A search by keyword and category: The search feature is part of the 
basic WordPress installation and is available in most WordPress tem-
plates. New Music Nation’s search feature adds a twist, however: You 
can type a keyword and then choose a category from a drop-down menu 
to search for that keyword within posts in a particular category. This 
search capability is necessary because the site has approximately 1,800 
categories. Dave pared down his choices and decided that he wanted 
only a few select parent categories to appear in the drop-down menu to 
let readers search within 5 or 6 of the 1,800 categories.
 
✓ A subcategory search: The big challenge was creating an alphabetical 
navigation system to let readers browse Dave’s 1,800 categories. His 
structure is something like this:
- Parent category
- - roughly 850 subcategories
 
 You can view, for example, the Artists directory. Artists is a parent cat-
egory, with 850-plus subcategories that single out specific artists. We 
created a subcategory navigation system to let readers navigate the art-
ists in alphabetical order, by their first names. Click the letter A to find 
artists whose names start with that letter, and so on.
In terms of content, you don’t see the typical chronological listing of posts 
on this site. Instead, you see Dave’s most recent posts in each of his parent 
categories: Reviews, College Radio Buzz, Top 20 Albums Standing, and News 
Notes. Other features include

341
 Chapter 16: Ten WordPress Web Sites Used As a CMS
 
✓ E-mail subscriptions: Visitors can enter their e-mail addresses to receive 
e-mail notifications regarding site updates and new posts to the blog.
 
✓ Contributors: If you’re interested in blogging about college radio, for 
example, you can sign up to contribute to the site. Find the handy regis-
tration form in the College Radio Buzz category.
Overall, New Music Nation is definitely not an out-of-the-box WordPress blog 
from a guy who is not so out of the box himself.
AlexKing.org
http://alexking.org
You may recognize the name of this site. After all, it’s one of the links in your 
blog’s default blogroll when you first install WordPress. Alex King is one of the 
original developers of WordPress. Though he is not involved in WordPress 
development any longer, he remains an invaluable asset to the overall com-
munity through his ongoing plugin development and consulting practice.
I had the opportunity to interview Alex about his recent site design. 
Something he said during our interview struck me as being one of the best 
testimonials to the extensibility of WordPress:
I enjoy bending WordPress to my will — not the other way around.
And bending, he does. Contorting is more like it. His front page is actually 
not a blog at all, but a portal that leverages all the content he has available 
throughout his site without making it look cluttered. Alex includes these fea-
tures in his front page:
 
✓ A clean, clearly marked navigational menu to the various hot spots on 
his site.
 
✓ Helpful information about and links to the projects featured on the site. 
Alex is a busy consultant and developer, and he makes great use of this 
space to spotlight his projects.
 
✓ Links, with excerpts, to the most recent posts Alex has made to his 
News category via the RSS category feed.
 
✓ A column that starts with some pertinent information about Alex him-
self, including his mug shot.
 
✓ The most recent post he made to his blog.
 
✓ A search feature to help readers find what they’re looking for (and to 
give some space to advertisers).

342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
What is noticeably absent from this WordPress-powered site is a chronologi-
cal listing of blog posts on the front page. The portal works extremely well, 
considering the vast amount of information and content that Alex has up for 
public consumption on his site. You can find the traditional blog layout, how-
ever, by clicking the Blog link in the navigation menu at the top.
Mosaic Consulting, Inc.
http://mosaic-consulting.com/
Mosaic Consulting is a small legal IT consulting company whose work spans 
the globe. Mosaic chose WordPress as a CMS because of the software’s flex-
ibility and extensibility.
The company doesn’t run a blog on its site. Instead, it offers an unlimited 
number of static pages on the site — pages that someone created without 
ever having to touch a piece of the underlying code in the theme. The site 
also uses WordPress categories and subcategories in a nice dynamic naviga-
tion menu that takes visitors through the various sections of the site.
Mosaic Consulting is not an Internet-based company; neither does it do busi-
ness in the virtual world. The company works with Fortune 500 corporations 
and their internal legal teams to help them form solutions to their every-
day legal IT problems. It does use the power of the Internet combined with 
WordPress, however, to provide an interactive online brochure of sorts.
CSS Collection
http://csscollection.com
CSS Collection is a showcase site powered by WordPress. The purpose of the 
site is to showcase what people can do with Cascading Style Sheets when 
building Web sites and blogs.
Here are some of the site’s features:
 
✓ Thumbnails: The front page includes thumbnail images of sites that 
make the cut. Click a thumbnail, and you go to the Web site that is being 
showcased in that entry. The thumbnailing is accomplished through the 
image handler in WordPress, along with some custom coding done with 
the Custom Fields tool.

343
 Chapter 16: Ten WordPress Web Sites Used As a CMS
 
✓ Interactive ratings: Click any Web site’s title, and you go to a single page 
where you can comment on the entry, saying why you think that site is 
really great — or not so great. Through the use of a plugin called Rate 
My Stuff (http://deadcantrant.com/projects/rate/), the folks 
at CSS Collection let readers rate each site with a star-rating system.
CSS Collection also makes good use of the typical blog layout and functions 
that you are used to seeing with WordPress, but the blog is not the primary 
part of the site. Rather, the site keeps a news section active with announce-
ments and updates, using the old-fashioned blog layout that we’ve come to 
expect with WordPress. Here are two ways they accomplish this:
 
✓ RSS feeds: CSS Collection pulls a few of the most recent news updates 
onto its front page to make it easy for visitors to stay up to date with the 
newest information posted in the news section.
 
✓ Categories: Through the WordPress category system, CSS Collection 
categorizes the selected sites in a logical, organized fashion, giving you 
an easy way to navigate the sites reviewed in the CSS showcase.
b5media
http://b5media.com
If you’re new to blogs and the blogosphere, you may not know about 
b5media, but I feel confident that you will soon. Eventually, everyone runs 
into b5media. b5media is the largest blog network on the Internet today, 
with more than 350 blogs in its network. The people behind the madness 
are always more than happy to brag about the fact that their network is run 
entirely with WordPress.
When I started digging around at the company’s site, I assumed that b5media 
was taking full advantage of the technologies provided with the WordPress 
MU (Multi-User) software. They were quick to correct me. “We are not using 
WordPress MU at all,” they said, “although in many ways, we have duplicated 
what MU does by using different technologies and scripting techniques that 
we’ve developed throughout the process.”
RSS is a huge portion of the strategy in place at b5media, which has built a 
network of niche blogs, including various channels that work with several 
topics of interest. Although individual blogs are really the target audience at 
b5, each channel also serves as a “place of discovery,” with something for 
everyone.

344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The front page of b5media showcases these channels through RSS feed tech-
nology and WordPress’s built-in Magpie technology. Every time you load the 
b5media front page, you’re treated to a random channel listing with different 
posts listed there, brought in by the channel feed.
b5media does have a blog on its site, but the blog isn’t up front and center. 
b5 didn’t want the blog to be the site’s focus; the company wanted to deem-
phasize the blog and spotlight individual b5 blogs and channels instead. 
You can find the b5media blog by clicking the Our Blog link in the site’s top 
navigation menu. Snippets of blog content are also pulled into the front page 
under the b5 Headlines header.
All the blogs that make up the b5media empire are connected through a blog-
roll. Each site has the b5media blogroll displayed prominently, making it easy 
for visitors to navigate from one b5 blog to the next. Who needs the rest of 
the Internet when you have b5? I’m sure that the b5 folks would say the same.
Hot Air
http://hotair.com
Hot Air burst onto the scene in 2006 as the first independently owned, con-
servative Internet broadcast network, featuring an original daily video news-
cast. Yes, we’re talking politics here. Hot Air was founded by famous media 
personality Michelle Malkin.
The Hot Air motto is “Exposing new viewers to the revolutionary world of vid-
eoblogging, animation, and Internet broadcasting.” All this is brought to you 
through the WordPress blogging platform, which is the site’s CMS of choice.
The designer who helped bring Hot Air to life is Peter Flaschner from The 
Blog Studio (http://theblogstudio.com). During the course of writing 
this book, I interviewed Peter about the WordPress technologies hard at 
work at Hot Air and what techniques he used to make it such a striking exam-
ple of thinking out of the box when it comes to blog development.
Regarding the use of WordPress, Peter had this to say: “WordPress was 
the chosen platform for this project because of its proven ability for it to 
withstand a lot of traffic and protection from malicious attacks from their 
detractors. The owners of the site are all familiar with the use of WordPress, 
through other projects they’ve been involved with prior to the launch of Hot 
Air, so that made the choice an easy one.”
The videos are created with a Sony HVR-A1U Digital HDV Handycam and 
edited with Avid Xpress DV and Adobe After Effects. To get those videos 
into the blog, Hot Air uses the WP-FLV plugin, created by Roel Meurders, 

345
 Chapter 16: Ten WordPress Web Sites Used As a CMS
at http://roel.meurders.nl/wordpress-plugins/wp-flv-video-
player-plugin/. The Hot Air folks insert the Adobe Flash videos directly 
and seamlessly into the blog posts. The nice design treatment that Peter gave 
the video display pulls together an extremely dynamic-looking video blog.
As far as the overall format of the blog goes, it doesn’t feature the typical 
chronological blog postings, one after the other. Instead, visitors are treated 
to video hits that encompass the entire sensory package: information, music, 
voice commentary, and images.
MommyCast
http://mommycast.com
MommyCast lives in the genre of mommy blogs — blogs owned and main-
tained by mothers. But MommyCast takes that concept quite a bit further 
through its radio program. MommyCast.com is a unique online audio com-
pany by and for women who are immersed in the fullness of motherhood 
and life; the site’s motto is “Holding the world together, one child at a time.” 
MommyCast offers interviews with people on topics that encompass all 
things having to do with motherhood.
I had the chance to speak with Joelle Reeder of Moxie Design Studios 
(http://moxiedesignstudios.com), the design brain behind the 
MommyCast brand. Joelle had this to say about the decision to use 
WordPress as the CMS for the project: “The MommyCast show has sponsors 
who use WordPress, so it was a natural choice for them to go in the same 
direction. The people behind the project also have used WordPress in the 
past and were very familiar with the platform.”
The people at MommyCast record each radio show and then make it avail-
able for download on the site. You can listen to a show straight off the site or 
download the audio file and listen to the show later.
Through the creative use of WordPress’s Custom Fields feature, Joelle lets 
the MommyCast women insert a cute, eye-catching “Listen Now!” graphic into 
every post. The post authors don’t have to edit any code or even be aware of 
the underlying code that makes everything happen.
Joelle also implemented a really neat way to bring some visual vitality to 
each post through image thumbnailing, combined with Custom Fields, that 
lets them insert small images into each post that calls attention not only to 
the post but to the post topic. These Custom Fields are called Call Outs and 
they draw the eye in and make you pay attention.

Jane Wilson-Marquis
http://janewilsonmarquis.com/
The Jane Wilson-Marquis Web site is one of two sites in this chapter that 
are powered completely by WordPress, yet you don’t find a blog on the site. 
That’s right — no blog. That’s why the site is a perfect fit for this chapter as a 
showcase of what WordPress is capable of doing beyond the blog!
Jane is a couture bridal- and evening-gown designer, and her site is an exten-
sion of her design studio in New York City. The site includes several photos 
of her dresses and fashion shows in which her work has been exhibited.
The site relies heavily on the following WordPress features:
 
✓ Category structure
 
✓ Category page templates
 
✓ PHP code that allowed several different sidebar templates into different 
sections of the site
 
✓ Static page templates
 
✓ WP PageNavi, a plugin (http://lesterchan.net/wordpress/
readme/wp-pagenavi.html) that is used for the gallery pages to let 
readers navigate the dress designs easily
The site has been showcased in several design seminars and conferences, 
and people usually are very surprised to find that WordPress is the system 
behind the site. Their first question is usually “Well, where’s the blog?” The 
simple answer: “There is no blog.”
Weblogs at Harvard Law School
http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/
For this particular entry, I feel that I need to be collegiate and academic, and 
get into the Ivy League state of mind. This site is at Harvard, after all, and 
these folks are smart. But I figure that if Reese Witherspoon could do it in 
Legally Blonde, I certainly can hold my own with these Harvard types in this 
chapter.
Weblogs at Harvard Law School uses the WordPress MU software as a multi-
user solution for the large network of law blogs within the community. The 
application is set up to let anyone with a harvard.edu, radcliffe.edu, or 
hbs.edu e-mail address host a blog on Weblogs.

347
 Chapter 16: Ten WordPress Web Sites Used As a CMS
I include this site in this chapter to show what you can do with the 
WordPress MU software solution, as well as the type of network you can 
manage and maintain with it. On the front page of the site, you can sign up 
for your own blog. Signing up automatically creates a blog with the domain 
http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/your-user-name.
Weblogs at Harvard Law School also makes fine use of RSS technology in two 
sections of the site:
 
✓ Updates: This section lists all the blogs in the system, listed by order 
of update, so you find the most recently updated blogs at the top of the 
list. This feature is very useful if you’re a fan of the community and want 
to keep updated.
 
✓ Digest: This section tracks daily happenings in all Harvard Law blogs. 
You can subscribe to the RSS feed for the Harvard Law Blogs Digest to 
be notified any time a Harvard Law blog updates.
The entire site and its portal are pretty simple, without a whole lot of magic 
going on. The straightforward interface gives visitors the information they 
need. The Harvard Law network takes full advantage of the free themes that 
WordPress designers release throughout the Web, giving members myriad 
looks to choose among and making Weblogs a network of unique blogs.
E.Webscapes Design Studio
http://ewebscapes.com
I have to issue a disclaimer for this listing: I’ve owned and operated this site 
since 1998. I include it in this chapter not so much to self-promote (although 
that is a bonus!) but as a way to illustrate some great things that you can do 
with just one installation of the WordPress software. I often refer people to 
my site when I explain how WordPress not only powers a great blog, but also 
is the foundation of a fully functional business Web site.
E.Webscapes has several sections:
 
✓ The front page: This page contains an introductory message to visitors, 
some examples of my work, links to news and updates, and the latest 
article headlines from my Design Blog in the right sidebar. Along the 
bottom, you find information about book purchases; you also can search 
the site, find client testimonials and links to my services and terms, and 
input your e-mail address to subscribe to updates.
 
✓ The Design Blog: I update this blog regularly with information about the 
design projects that my designers and I have completed for our clients.

348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ FAQ: This page lists frequently asked questions, along with their 
answers, to help clients and potential clients make informed decisions 
about my services.
 
✓ Folio: This section is the design portfolio that spotlights all the projects 
that my designers and I have done in the past.
As you can see in navigating the site, all the pages, posts, and categories dis-
play a little differently, depending on the purpose of each page. This site was 
created with a single installation of WordPress; the format and layout were 
accomplished through the creation of a custom theme.

Chapter 17
Ten Popular WordPress Plugins
In This Chapter
▶ Finding popular WordPress plugins
▶ Using plugins to enhance your blog
I
n this chapter, I list ten of the most popular plugins available for your 
WordPress blog. This list isn’t exhaustive by any means; hundreds of 
excellent WordPress plugins can, and do, provide multiple ways to extend 
the functionality of your blog. And if these ten plugins aren’t enough for you, 
you can find many more at the official WordPress Plugin Directory (http://
wordpress.org/extend/plugins).
 
The greatest plugin of all is Akismet, which I describe in Chapter 10. Akismet is 
the answer to comment and trackback spam; it kills spam dead. I don’t cover 
it in this chapter because Akismet stands alone as an absolute must for any 
WordPress blog and comes installed with WordPress. 
Chapter 10 contains information on how to locate, download, unpack, install, 
activate, and manage plugins in your WordPress blog.

WP Print is one of several WordPress plugins developed by Lester Chan. This 
easy-to-use plugin provides a clean, printable version of your blog posts and/
or pages.

350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Unless your blog theme has a specialized stylesheet for printing, posts and 
pages print rather messily. WP Print strips most of the style from your theme 
design (images and formatting, for example) and outputs a clean print of your 
article with black text on a white background.
You can configure these options:
 
✓ Print Text Link for Post: This option configures the text of the link you 
want to show on your blog posts to prompt your visitors to print your 
article. (The default setting is Print This Post.)
 
✓ Print Text Link for Page: This option configures the text of the link you 
want to show on your blog pages to prompt your visitors to print your 
page. (The default setting is Print This Page.)
 
✓ Print Icon: Choose between two icons: print.gif and printer_fam 
fam fam.gif. The icon you choose appears on your site.
 
✓ Print Text Style Link: This drop-down menu presents settings for 
displaying the print link on your site:
 
• Print Icon with Text Link
 
• Print Icon Only
 
• Text Link Only
 
• Custom (lets you design your own text link)
 
✓ Print Comments?: Choose Yes to print comments on your blog post 
or page.
 
✓ Print Links?: Choose Yes to print links that appear in your blog post 
or page.
 
✓ Print Images?: Choose Yes to print images that appear in your blog post 
or page.
 
✓ Disclaimer/Copyright Text?: Type your desired copyright and/or dis-
claimer statement in the text box. This text appears on the printed copy 
of your blog post or page.
WP Print doesn’t automatically appear on your blog; you need to add a small 
snippet of code to your blog template in the area where you want the print 
link to appear. That small snippet of code is this:
<?php if(function_exists(‘wp_print’)) { print_link(); } ?>
Place the code within The Loop. (See Chapter 12 for information about 
The Loop.)

While you’re at Lester’s site, check out all the other plugins he has available. 
His plugins are well known and very popular among WordPress users.
Subscribe to Comments
Developer: Mark Jaquith
http://txfx.net/code/wordpress/subscribe-to-comments
The Subscribe to Comments plugin adds a very nice feature to your blog by 
letting your visitors subscribe to individual posts you’ve made to your blog. 
When they do this, they receive notification via e-mail whenever someone 
leaves a new comment on the post. This feature goes a long way toward keep-
ing your readers informed and making the discussions lively and active!
The plugin includes a full-featured subscription manager that your comment-
ers can use to unsubscribe to certain posts, block all notifications, or even 
change their notification e-mail address.
ShareThis
Developer: Alex King
http://sharethis.com/wordpress
Every social bookmarking service has its own icon. People put these icons 
on their blogs as a way to let their visitors know that they could share their 
content with each social bookmarking service. This was a good concept 
when only a handful of services existed; then these services started pop-
ping up everywhere. Pretty soon, people were putting a dozen — sometimes 
even two dozen — bookmarking icons on their sites to encourage visitors to 
submit their content to all those different services.
ShareThis is a plugin that combines an “e-mail this” plugin and social book-
marking service, allowing visitors to share content through e-mail and popu-
lar social bookmarking services such as Technorati, del.icio.us, and Digg.
When you’ve installed the plugin, go to the Options page for ShareThis, and 
set these options:

352
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Enter the Widget Code: Obtain the code from the ShareThis Web site; 
then copy the code into the text box.
 
✓ Display the Link Only on Certain Pages of Your Blog: By default, the 
ShareThis link is added at the very end of your blog post and page. You 
can turn this default option off. Choose No from the Automatically Add 
ShareThis to Your Posts and the Automatically Add ShareThis to Your 
Pages drop-down menus that appear on the ShareThis Options page. 
Then add the ShareThis template tag to your template wherever you 
want it to display in your blog:
<?php if (function_exists(‘sharethis_button’)) { sharethis_button(); } ?>
 
This plugin requires the wp-footer() call in the footer (footer.php) of 
your template. If your theme doesn’t include a wp_footer() call, you can 
add it easily by opening the footer.php template and adding this bit of code:
<?php wp_footer(); ?>
All in One SEO Pak
Developer: uberdose
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/
Almost everyone is concerned about Search Engine Optimization (SEO) in 
blogs. Good SEO practices help the major search engines (such as Google, 
Yahoo!, and MSN) easily find and cache your blog content in their search 
databases so that when people search for keywords, they can find your blog 
in the search results.
All in One SEO Pak helps you fine-tune your blog to make that happen. It auto-
matically creates optimized titles and generates HTML keywords for your 
individual posts.
All in One SEO Pak has a nice options page where you can fill in all sorts of 
information about your blog, including keywords and formatting of the post 
or page titles within your site to make them easy for search engines to index. 
Find the All in One SEO Pak Options page by clicking the Settings link at the 
top right corner of your WordPress Administration panel, and then click the 
All in One SEO subtab.

WordPress Mobile Edition
Developer: Alex King
http://alexking.org/projects/wordpress
Another great plugin from the talented Alex King is WordPress Mobile 
Edition, which provides a custom display of your blog for a mobile device. 
Mobile browsers are detected automatically; no configuration is needed.
As mobile Web browsing becomes more and more popular, you want to make 
sure that your site renders decently in your readers’ mobile browsers. This 
plugin will do it for you. It’s fast, it’s easy, and it does the job.
WP-DB-Backup
Developers: filosofo, skippy, Firas, LaughingLizard, MtDewVirus, Podz, and 
Ringmaster
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-db-backup/
Throughout this book, I often remind you to back up your files. In my work 
outside this book, I’m always encouraging my friends and clients to back up.
WP-DB-Backup is a plugin that provides a very easy method of creating a 
backup of your MySQL database. Remember, the database stores all the 
important data for your blog: your posts, pages, links, categories, comments, 
trackbacks, and settings. 
If something happens to your database, and you don’t have a backup, you’ll 
be starting over from page one. Do yourself a huge favor: Make regular back-
ups of your database by using this plugin. You wouldn’t need to use one of 
those backup files to restore your blog very often, but when you do need to, 
a backup can make the difference between a good day and jumping off a cliff!
You can choose to have the backup file sent to an e-mail address of your 
choosing, downloaded to your computer, or stored on your Web sever in a 
backup folder inside your wp-content folder.
You can also schedule regular hourly, daily, or weekly backups and have 
those backup files emailed to you.

354
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
WP-DB-Backup is a great way to have some peace of mind. If something cata-
strophic happens to your Web server, you have a backup of all your blog 
content sitting safely on your own computer.
WP Ajax Edit Comments
Developer: Ronald Huereca
http://raproject.com/wordpress/wp-ajax-edit-comments/
Using the WP Ajax Edit Comments plugin is a way for you to do a huge favor 
for the readers of your site, because this plugin lets readers edit their own 
comments on your blog. I don’t know about you, but I have days when I could 
be considered the queen of typos and grammatical errors, and when I’ve 
made such an error in a comment on someone’s blog, I’ve wished that I could 
log in to his WordPress Administration panel to edit my comment. Those of 
you who have this plugin installed on your blogs, please accept my gratitude!
This plugin doesn’t require your readers to log in to your WordPress 
Administration panel to edit their comments; they can do it right on the 
Comments page of your blog. On the Options page, you can set the amount 
of time you let your readers edit their comments (for example, within 30 
minutes of leaving the comment). The developer provides full instructions, 
including video guides, on the plugin’s home page.
cformsII
Developer: Oliver Seidel
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cforms
cformsII lets you create forms within your pages and posts. You can even 
have multiple forms on one page. You can use forms to provide a variety of 
features on your site:
 
✓ Contact forms: A visitor fills out a contact form with her name, e-mail 
address, and message. When the visitor clicks the Submit button, the 
message gets e-mailed to you.
 
✓ Questionnaires: A form with a number of questions for site visitors to 
answer. The questions are posed by the site owner, followed by text 
boxes to allow the visitor to answer those questions. When the visitor 
clicks the Submit button, the site owner receives the questionnaire and 
the answers in an e-mail.

355
 Chapter 17: Ten Popular WordPress Plugins
 
✓ User submissions: Readers can send images, audio, or video files to you 
via e-mail.
 
✓ Sales order forms: I use this form on my Web site (http://eweb
scapes.com/order). This sales order form asks clients very specific 
questions about their Web site designs. When they click the Submit 
button, I receive their full orders in my e-mails.
When this plugin is activated, click the cformsII tab in the Administration 
panel to load the Form Settings page. Within the cformsII options, you have 
several ways to build and style your forms.
The plugin’s author has extensive documentation and a cformsII user forum 
at http://deliciousdays.com/cforms-forum.
Google XML Sitemaps
Developer: Arne Brachhold
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-sitemap-
generator
This plugin lets you create a Google-compliant site map of your entire blog. 
Every single time you create a new post or page, the site map is updated and 
submitted to several major search engines, including Google, Yahoo!, and 
MSN. This plugin helps the search engines find and catalog new content from 
your site, so your new content appears in the search engines faster than it 
would if you didn’t have a site map.
WordPress.com Stats
Developer: Andy Skelton and Michael D. Adams
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats
With the rise in popularity of the hosted WordPress.com service came a huge 
demand for the statistics that WordPress.com provides in its Dashboard 
pages. Users of the self-hosted WordPress.org software drooled when they 
saw the stats available to WordPress.com users, and the cry for a similar 
stats plugin for WordPress.org went out across the blogosphere.
Andy Skelton answered that call with the release of the WordPress.com Stats 
plugin for WordPress.org users. This plugin, installed on your WordPress.org 
blog, starts collecting all the important statistics that any blogger would want 

356
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
to know about the activity on his blog, including the number of hits on the 
site per hour, day, or month; the most popular posts; the sources of the traf-
fic on the blog; and the links people click to leave the site.
The stats are provided for you on one easy-to-view page. This plugin doesn’t 
count your own visits to your blog, so you can be assured that the counts are 
accurate, not inflated by your own visits.
You need a WordPress.com API key for the stats plugin to work. (See Chapter 
10 for information on how to obtain a WordPress.com API key.) To enter the 
key, click the Plugins link in the Administration panel, click the WordPress.
com Stats subtab, and type the API key there.
After you’ve activated the plugin and inserted your WordPress.com API key, 
click the Dashboard link in the Administration panel to see the Blog Stats 
subtab. Click this subtab to view your stats.

Chapter 18
Ten Free WordPress Themes
In This Chapter
▶ Finding good WordPress themes
▶ Using popular WordPress themes to style your blog
B
ecause I’m a WordPress theme developer and designer, this chapter was 
probably the most difficult for me to put together. I know, I know . . . I 
was thinking the same thing as you: “Ten great WordPress themes — no big 
deal!” Yet it’s a very big deal because the themes available for WordPress 
number in the thousands, if not hundreds of thousands. Many of these themes 
are excellent, and picking a mere ten was really tough. The list I present here 
isn’t exhaustive by any means. Chapters 11, 12, and 13 give you a few more 
resources to find a theme that suits your needs.
I kept these criteria in mind when choosing the following themes:
 
✓ User-friendly: The best themes incorporate as much detail as possible 
to let the theme user just load the theme and start blogging without a 
whole lot of fuss and muss. You can use these themes directly out of 
the box, but usually, they have a whole lot more to offer if you want to 
tinker. The key is that you don’t have to tinker.
 
✓ Compatible with widgets: Themes that are set up to use WordPress 
sidebar widgets are the most user-friendly. Widgets are wonderful, and 
they make your blogging life incredibly easy by giving you drag-and-drop 
functionality and control of the content that appears in your sidebar. (If 
you don’t know what widgets are, flip back to Chapter 5.)
 
✓ Free price tag: 2007 saw a boom in popularity of premium themes, 
which you pay to download. Although I don’t have anything against this 
practice, I want this chapter to present themes that you can easily find 
and use without having to pay a penny.

358
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Valid code: A set of standards for Web design and code called the W3C 
standards, developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (http://
w3c.org), serves as a sort of proofreading guide for the code in all Web 
site designs. Although you may not notice it, valid XHTML code goes a 
very long way toward ensuring that the theme you’re using meets that 
set of standards, and you can be relatively confident that your blog site 
isn’t causing errors in different browsers.
 
 Designers who pay attention to valid code are the designers to look for 
when you choose a theme for your site, because they understand valida-
tion and your need to make sure that your site is reaching all your visi-
tors, no matter what browsers they’re using to view your content.
 
 You can tell whether a designer used valid code on his site by using two 
validation tools on the W3C Web site: http://validator.w3.org for 
HTML code validation and http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator 
for CSS code validation.
With these things in mind, I present the top-ten free WordPress themes avail-
able for you to try on your site. The Web sites listed for each of these themes 
have a demo of the theme, so you can actually see it in action. These themes 
aren’t listed in any particular order; each one is just as good as the next.
Cutline
Theme designer: Chris Pearson
http://cutline.tubetorial.com
The highlights of this theme are the following:
 
✓ It has a very clean, uncluttered two-column layout.
 
✓ Small details in this theme make the big picture shine: detailed treat-
ment of lists, block and pulled quotes, and comment links, to name just 
a few.
 
✓ It supports the WordPress Widgets plugin (which you can find at 
http://automattic.com/code/widgets).
 
✓ It supports the flickrRSS plugin (available at http://eightface.com/
wordpress/flickrrss).
 
✓ It supports the Random Header Images plugin (http://cutline.
tubetorial.com/totally-random-header-images-for-cut
line/), which lets you switch header images easily without even know-
ing how to manipulate the code.

359
 Chapter 18: Ten Free WordPress Themes
Cutline (shown in Figure 18-1) makes it to the top of my list because I think 
it’s one of the most functional, versatile, and friendly free themes available.

Tarski
Theme designers: Ben Eastaugh and Chris Sternal-Johnson
http://tarskitheme.com
The highlights of this theme are the following:
 
✓ The admin options menu gives you several options to customize your 
theme and includes several nicely designed header graphics.
 
✓ Its print stylesheet maximizes the paper output of your site for people 
who are interested in printing your blog posts.
 
✓ It has a two-column layout.
 
✓ Its sidebar is widget ready.

360
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The Tarski theme designers make it very easy for you to personalize your blog 
without being required to know a lick of HTML, CSS, or coding that is usu-
ally required to accomplish the changes necessary to personalize your blog 
theme. It comes with a choice of header artwork for you to choose from; to 
change the header artwork, you just select the artwork in the theme options 
page. The options page for the Tarski theme also provides you with several 
options you can select to further personalize the theme to suit your needs.
The theme’s Web site has comprehensive information on using the theme 
and its features.
SandPress
Theme designer: Arpit Jacob
http://clazh.com/sandpress-free-wordpress-theme
The SandPress theme was the first-place winner of a recent WordPress theme 
design competition held in June/July 2007 at http://sndbx.org. SandPress 
provides you with a very clean, three-column layout. The theme designer 
paid very special attention to the small details of the theme, such as fantas-
tic icons that call colorful attention to various sections of your site (such as 
comments, page navigation, RSS feeds, and so on).
xMark
Theme designer: Lisa Sabin-Wilson
http://blogdesignsolutions.com
The highlights of this theme are the following:
 
✓ It’s a fully fluid three-column theme. (Fluid means that it expands and 
contracts to fill your browser page, no matter what size your browser is.)
 
✓ It displays blog content on the left and two widget-ready sidebars on the 
right.
 
✓ Its admin options menu lets you choose various settings for your theme.
 
✓ The theme supports several popular WordPress plugins. The integration 
is seamless, meaning that if you have the plugins installed in WordPress, 
they’ll work automatically; if you don’t have them installed, you won’t 
even notice the functionality. 

361
 Chapter 18: Ten Free WordPress Themes
After you activate the xMark theme, click the xMark tab in the Administration 
panel to find a few options that you can set for your blog. These options let 
you make significant choices for displaying certain features on your blog 
without having to tinker with the actual code inside the template.
Another important feature is that the theme is optimized for search engines, 
which gives you an edge in having the popular search engines find and list 
your site.
Stargaze
Theme designer: Joni Ang
http://taintedsong.com/2008/02/20/stargaze-wordpress-theme
By the designer’s own admission, this particular theme is a bit more “girly” 
than most. Most free WordPress themes do seem to have a distinct lack of 
femininity, so I thought I would present a female-oriented one here.
Stargaze is a beautiful two-column theme that is widget ready (meaning that 
you can use WordPress widgets with this theme without having to do any 
special adjustments to the theme). The color scheme is a nice combination of 
blue, yellow, and pink, with a variety of nicely placed icons and design 
elements drawing attention to specific areas of your content.
Revolution Two Themes
Theme designer: Brian Gardner
http://revolutiontwo.com
Brian Gardner is a talented, respected designer of WordPress themes, and has 
several free themes available within his Revolution Two pack of themes (see 
Figure 18-2). Currently, he has 13 themes available for free download from his 
Web site. The themes vary in structure and design and cover everything from 
personal to professional blogs, and video and photo gallery formats.

iTheme
Theme designer: Nick La
http://ndesign-studio.com/resources/wp-themes/itheme
iTheme is a WordPress theme designed with Macintosh lovers in mind. The 
theme emulates the design elements and features of the Macintosh operating 
system, with beautiful blue gradients and Maclike menu headers and icons. 
This theme has a fully configurable sidebar that allows you to use WordPress 
widgets, and when they’re in your blog, you can drag those widgets around in 
the sidebar.

363
 Chapter 18: Ten Free WordPress Themes
Redoable
Theme designer: Dean J. Robinson
http://deanjrobinson.com/wordpress/redoable
Redoable is the only dark theme that made my list of top tens. The light-text-
on-a-dark-background type of theme has gained popularity among designers 
and theme fans across the blogosphere, but it can make your blog difficult for 
some visitors to read. I include this theme because of the popularity of this 
type of look. Aside from readability issues, Redoable is a beautiful theme with 
a lot of detailed treatment, built on the popular K2 theme.
Redoable has a two-column layout, and its sidebar is widget ready. It sup-
ports multiple popular WordPress plugins. (See the theme’s Web page for 
details.) This theme also gives detailed treatment to many design classes, let-
ting you create a unique blog site.
Una
Theme designer: Dino Latoga
http://dinolatoga.com/2008/07/04/una-wordpress-theme/
Una (shown in Figure 18-3) is a very clean, two-column WordPress theme 
with a very nice and clean color scheme of tan, brown, and white. Una is 
widget compatible, so you can begin using WordPress widgets as soon as you 
activate this theme on your blog.
This theme displays your static page navigation menu at the top of the site, 
underneath your site title, for easy reader navigation through pages. Una also 
has a unique front page layout that displays the full text of your most recent 
post and then displays the last three posts you made prior to that with an 
excerpt of the post, accompanied by a thumbnail image that helps bring 
attention by directing your eye to that section of the front page.

Gridline Lite
Theme designer: Thad Allender
http://gridline.thadallender.com
Gridline Lite is a minimalist WordPress theme. The theme has clean, simple, 
light elements, which lets your design focus mainly on content rather than 
appearance. The theme uses black, white, and gray tones and a two-column 
layout, with content on the left and sidebar on the right.

Appendix
Migrating Your Existing 
Blog to WordPress
In This Appendix
▶ Preparing your current blog for migration
▶ Converting your template for use in WordPress
▶ Importing from different blog platforms
▶ Discovering other import resources
S
o you have a blog on a different blogging system and want to move 
your blog to WordPress? This appendix helps you accomplish just that. 
WordPress makes it relatively easy to pack up your data and archives from 
one blog platform and move to a new WordPress blog.
WordPress lets you move your blog from platforms such as Blogspot, 
TypePad, and Movable Type. It also gives you a nifty way to migrate from any 
blogging platform via RSS feeds. In this appendix, you discover how to pre-
pare your blog for migration and how to move from the specific platforms for 
which WordPress provides migration scripts.
Movin’ On Up
Bloggers have a variety of reasons to migrate away from one system to 
WordPress:
 
✓ Simple curiosity: There is a lot of buzz around the use of WordPress and 
the whole community of WordPress users. People are naturally curious 
to check out something that all the cool kids are doing.
 
✓ More control of your blog: This reason applies particularly to those 
who have a blog on Blogspot, TypePad, or any other hosted service. 
Hosted programs limit what you can do, create, and mess with. When 
it comes to plugins, add-ons, and theme creation, hosting a WordPress 

366
WordPress For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
blog on your own Web server wins hands down. In addition, you have 
complete control of your data, archives, and backup capability when 
you host your blog on your own server.
 
✓ Ease of use: Many people find the WordPress interface easier to use, 
more understandable, and a great deal more user-friendly than many of 
the other blogging platforms available today.
Both the hosted version of WordPress.com and the self-hosted version 
of WordPress.org let you migrate your blog to their platforms; however, 
WordPress.com accepts a few less than WordPress.org does. Table A-1 lists 
compatible blogging platforms for migration to WordPress.

Preparing for the Big Move
Depending on the size of your blog (that is, how many posts and comments 
you have), the migration process can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes. 
As with any major change or update you make, no matter where your blog 
is hosted, the very first thing you need to do is create a backup of your blog. 
You should back up the following:
 
✓ Archives: Posts, comments, and trackbacks
 
✓ Template: Template files and image files
 
✓ Links: Any links, banners, badges, and elements you have in your 
current blog
 
✓ Images: Any images you use in your blog

367
 Appendix: Migrating Your Existing Blog to WordPress
Table A-2 gives you a few tips on creating the export data for your blog in a 
few major blogging platforms. Note: This table assumes that you are logged 
in to your blog software.
Table A-2 
Backing Up Your Blog Data on Major Platforms
Blogging Platform
Backup Information
Movable Type
Click the Import/Export button in the menu of your Movable 
Type Administration panel; then click the Export Entries From 
link. When the page stops loading, save it on your computer 
as a .txt file.
TypePad
Click the name of the blog you want to export; then click the 
Import/Export link in the Overview menu. Click the Export 
link at the bottom of the Import/Export page. When the page 
stops loading, save it on your computer as a .txt file.
Blogspot
Back up your template by copying the text of your template 
to a text editor such as Notepad. Then save it on your com-
puter as a .txt file.
LiveJournal
Browse to http://livejournal.com/export.
bml and enter your information; choose XML as the format. 
Save this file on your computer.
WordPress
Click the Export link on the Tools menu in the Administration 
panel; the Export page opens. Choose your options on the 
Export page and then click the Download Export File button, 
and save this file on your computer. (Chapter 17 lists ten 
great WordPress plugins, including one that lets you back up 
your entire database.)
RSS feed
Point your browser to the URL of the RSS feed you want to 
import. Wait until it loads fully (you may need to set your feed 
to display all posts). View the source code of the page, copy 
and paste that source code into a .txt file, and save the 
file on your computer.
Converting Templates
Every blogging program has a unique way of delivering content and data 
to your blog. Template tags vary from program to program; no two are the 
same, and each template file requires conversion if you want to use your tem-
plate with your new WordPress blog. In such a case, two options are avail-
able to you:

368
WordPress For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
✓ Convert the template yourself. To accomplish this task, you need to 
know WordPress template tags and HTML. If you have a template that 
you’re using on another blogging platform and want to convert it for 
use with WordPress, you need to swap out the original platform tags 
for WordPress tags. Chapters 12 and 13 give you the rundown on basic 
WordPress template tags; you may find that information useful if you 
plan to attempt a template conversion yourself.
 
✓ Hire an experienced WordPress consultant to do the conversion for 
you. See Chapter 15 for a list of WordPress consultants.
To use your own template, make sure that you have saved all the template 
files, the images, and the stylesheet from your previous blog setup. You need 
them to convert the template(s) for use in WordPress.
 
Hundreds of free templates are available for use with WordPress, so it may be 
a lot easier to abandon the template you’re currently working with and find a 
free WordPress template that you like. If you’ve paid to have a custom design 
done for your blog, contact the designer of your theme, and hire him to per-
form the template conversion for you. Also, you can hire several WordPress 
consultants to perform the conversion for you — including yours truly.
Moving Your Blog
You’ve packed all your stuff, and you have your new place prepared. Moving 
day has arrived!
This section takes you through the steps for moving your blog from one 
blog platform to WordPress. This section assumes that you already have 
the WordPress software installed and configured on your own Web server 
(see Chapter 6 for information about installing WordPress.org). You can also 
apply these steps to moving your blog to a WordPress.com hosted blog (Part 
II is all about WordPress.com).
Find the import function that you need by following these steps:
 
1. In the Administration panel, click the Import link on the Tools menu.
 
 The Import page opens, listing blogging platforms from which you can 
import content (such as Blogger and Movable Type). Figure A-1 shows 
the Import page for WordPress.com, and Figure A-2 shows this page for 
WordPress.org.
 
2. Click the link for the blogging platform you’re working with.
 
 WordPress displays a page that lists directions and the information you 
need to fill in before you begin the import.
The following sections provide import directions for each platform.

Importing from Blogspot/Blogger
I call it Blogspot; you call it Blogger — a rose by any other name would smell 
as sweet. The blogging application owned by Google is referenced either way: 
Blogspot or Blogger. In the end, we’re talking about the same application.
To begin the import process, first complete the steps in the “Moving Your 
Blog” section, earlier in this chapter. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Blogger link on the Import page. 
 
 The Import Blogger page loads and you see a message that says, Howdy! 
This importer allows you to import posts and comments 
from your Blogger account into your WordPress blog. 
The message goes on to explain that you need a Google account, and 
that you need to tell Google you’re authorizing your WordPress blog to 
access your Blogger blog.
 
2. Click the Authorize button to tell WordPress to access your account.
 
 A page from Google opens with a message that says your WordPress 
blog is trying to access your Google account (see Figure A-3).
 
3. Enter the e-mail address and password you use for Google; then click 
the Sign In button.
 
 The Access Request page in your Google Account opens.
 
 When you have successfully logged in, you receive a message from 
Google stating that your blog at WordPress is requesting access to your 
Blogger account so that it can post entries on your behalf.
 
4. Give your permission by clicking the Grant Access button on the 
Access Request page.
 
 If you have many posts and comments in your Blogger blog, the import 
can take 30 minutes or more.
 
 After the import script has performed its magic, you’re redirected to 
your WordPress Administration panel, where the name of your Blogger 
blog is listed.
 
5. To complete the import of the data from your Blogger blog, click the 
Import button (below the Magic Button header).
 
 The text on the button changes to Importing . . . while the import takes 
place. When the import is complete, the text on the button changes to 
Set Authors (no wonder it’s called the Magic Button!).
 
6. Click the Set Authors button to assign the authors to the posts.
 
 The Blogger username appears on the left side of the page; a drop-down 
menu on the right side of the page displays the WordPress login name.

Google login 
information

WordPress 
to access 
your 
account.
 
 
7. Assign authors using the drop-down menu.
 
 If you have just one author on each blog, the process is especially easy: 
Use the drop-down menu on the right to assign the WordPress login to 
your Blogger username. If you have multiple authors on both blogs, each 
Blogger username is listed on the left side with a drop-down menu to the 
right of each username. Select a WordPress login for each Blogger user-
name to make the author assignments.
 
8. Click Save Changes.
 
 You’re done!
Importing from Blogware
Compared with some of the major players out there today, Blogware is 
not a hugely popular blogging platform, and at this writing, the Blogware 
import script imports posts only; it doesn’t import comments or trackbacks. 
Also, the Blogware importer is available only for the self-hosted software at 
WordPress.org. WordPress.com currently doesn’t provide an import script 
for Blogware.

372
WordPress For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
If you use Blogware, follow these steps to migrate your blog to WordPress:
 
1. Create an XML file in your Blogware administration interface.
 
 Go to the Settings & Security tab in your Blogware Administration panel, 
scroll down to the bottom of the page, and click the Import/Export link 
to generate an Export (XML) file.
 
2. Save the XML file on your computer as a .txt file (for example, 
import.txt).
 
3. Go to the Import page in your WordPress Administration panel.
 
 To get to the Import page, follow Steps 1 and 2 in the “Moving Your 
Blog” section, earlier in this chapter.
 
4. Click the Blogware link.
 
 The Import Blogware page opens. From this page, you can extract the 
XML file that you saved in Step 2 into your WordPress blog.
 
5. Click the Browse button.
 
 A window opens, displaying a list of files.
 
6. Double-click the .txt file that you saved in Step 2.
 
7. Click the Upload and Import button.
 
 Sit back and let the import script do its magic. When the script is done, 
it reloads the page with a confirmation message that the process is 
complete.
Importing from DotClear
At this writing, WordPress.com doesn’t provide an import option for 
DotClear–powered blogs. If you’re importing a DotClear blog to a WordPress.
org blog, follow Steps 1 and 2 in the “Moving Your Blog” section, earlier in 
this chapter, to go to the Import page. Click the DotClear link, and a page 
appears that asks for several items of information about your blog (see 
Figure A-4).
Enter the requested information, including the database user, password, 
database name, host, table prefix, and originating character set. (If you’re not 
sure where to find the information you need, contact your hosting service 
provider or DotClear.) Then click the Import Categories button.

Importing from Greymatter
Greymatter is an old blogging platform that was popular in the early 2000s. 
Not many bloggers use Greymatter anymore, but for the one or two of 
you reading this book who may still be using it, WordPress.org does pro-
vide an import script for migrating your blog posts, comments, and users. 
(WordPress.com doesn’t offer an import script for a Greymatter blog.)
Go to the Import page (see Steps 1 and 2 in the “Moving Your Blog” section, 
earlier in this chapter). Then click the Greymatter link and enter the details 
that the import script asks for, such as the path to your Greymatter files and 
the last entry number, which you can obtain from your Greymatter control 
panel. Fill in that information and then click OK to start the import process, 
as shown in Figure A-5.
 
If you are unsure where to find the information about your Greymatter files 
and entries, consult your Web hosting provider or the developer of 
Greymatter.

Importing from LiveJournal
Both WordPress.com and WordPress.org offer an import script for 
LiveJournal users, and the process of importing from LiveJournal to 
WordPress is the same for each platform.
To export your blog content from LiveJournal, log in to your LiveJournal blog 
and then type this URL in your browser’s address bar: www.livejournal.
com/export.bml.
LiveJournal lets you export the XML files one month at a time, so if you have 
a blog with several months’ worth of posts, be prepared to be at this process 
for a while. First, you have to export the entries one month at a time, and 
then you have to import them into WordPress — yep, you guessed it — one 
month at a time.
 
To speed the process a little, you can save all the exported XML LiveJournal files 
in one text document by copying and pasting each month’s XML file into one 
plain-text file (created in a text editor such as Notepad), thereby creating one 
long XML file with all the posts from your LiveJournal blog. Then you can then 
save the file as an XML file to prepare it for import into your WordPress blog.

375
 Appendix: Migrating Your Existing Blog to WordPress
After you export the XML file from LiveJournal, return to the Import page in 
your WordPress Administration panel, and follow these steps:
 
1. Click the LiveJournal link.
 
 The Import LiveJournal page opens, from which you can extract the XML 
file into your WordPress blog.
 
2. Click the Browse button.
 
 A window opens, listing files on your computer.
 
3. Double-click the name of the XML file you saved earlier.
 
4. Click the Upload and Import button.
 
 When the import script finishes, it reloads the page with a confirmation 
message that the process is complete. Then WordPress runs the import 
script and brings over all your posts from your LiveJournal blog.
Importing from Movable Type 
and TypePad
Movable Type and TypePad were created by the same company, Six Apart. 
These two blogging platforms run on essentially the same code base, so the 
import/export procedure is basically the same for both. Refer to Table A-2, 
earlier in this chapter, for details on how to run the export process in both 
Movable Type and TypePad. This import script moves all your blog posts, 
comments, and trackbacks to your WordPress blog.
Go to the Import page in your WordPress Administration panel by following 
Steps 1 and 2 in the “Moving Your Blog” section, earlier in this chapter. Then 
follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Movable Type and TypePad link. 
 
 You see instructions for importing the data you exported from your 
Movable Type or TypePad blog.
 
2. Click the Browse button.
 
 A window opens, listing your files.
 
3. Double-click the name of the export file you saved from your Movable 
Type or TypePad blog.
 
4. Click the Upload File and Import button.
 
 Sit back and let the import script do its magic. When it’s done, it reloads 
the page with a confirmation message that the process is complete.

376
WordPress For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
This import script allows for a maximum file size of 2MB. If you get an “out of 
memory” error, try dividing the import file into pieces and uploading them 
separately. The import script is smart enough to ignore duplicate entries, so if 
you need to run the script a few times to get it to take everything, you can do 
so without worrying about duplicating your content.
When the import script is done, you can assign users to the posts, matching 
the Movable Type or TypePad usernames with WordPress usernames. If you 
have just one author on each blog, this process is easy; you simply assign 
your WordPress login to the Movable Type or Typepad username using the 
drop-down menu. If you have multiple authors on both blogs, match the 
Movable Type or TypePad usernames with the correct WordPress login 
names and then click Save Changes. You’re done!
Importing from Textpattern
If you’re importing a blog from Textpattern to WordPress.org, go to the 
Import page in your WordPress Administration panel by following Steps 1 
and 2 in the “Moving Your Blog” section, earlier in this chapter. (WordPress.
com currently doesn’t offer an import option for Textpattern.) Click the 
Textpattern link to display a page that asks for specific information about 
your blog.
 
In addition to warning you that the import process “may take a few minutes 
depending on the size of your database,” WordPress warns that it imports 
from Textpattern 4.0.2+ only. If you have an earlier version, you need to 
upgrade your Textpattern version before importing. WordPress even 
warns you that this import script has not been tested on earlier versions of 
Textpattern, so it’s probably a grand idea to upgrade your Textpattern blog 
before attempting to run this import.
Enter the requested information — the Textpattern database user, password, 
name, host, and table prefix — and then click the Import Categories button to 
begin the import process.
Importing from WordPress
With this WordPress import script, you can import one WordPress blog 
into another, and this is true for both the hosted and self-hosted versions of 
WordPress. WordPress imports all your posts, comments, custom fields, and 
categories into your blog. Refer to Table A-2, earlier in this chapter, to find 
out how to use the export feature to obtain your blog data.

377
 Appendix: Migrating Your Existing Blog to WordPress
 
Only files 2MB or smaller can upload via the Import page of the WordPress.
com Administration panel. If you have a file that is larger than 2MB in size, you 
can break it into smaller files and import them as separate files.
When you complete the exporting, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the WordPress link on the Import page.
 
 To get to the Import page, follow Steps 1 and 2 of the “Moving Your 
Blog” section, earlier in this chapter.
 
2. Click the Browse button.
 
 A window opens, listing the files on your computer.
 
3. Double-click the export file you saved earlier from your WordPress 
blog.
 
4. Click the Upload File and Import button.
 
 The import script gets to work, and when it’s done, it reloads the page 
with a confirmation message that the process is complete.
Importing from an RSS feed
If all else fails, or if WordPress doesn’t provide an import script that you 
need for your current blog platform, you can import your blog data via the 
RSS feed for the blog you want to import. With the RSS import method, you 
can import posts only; you can’t use this method to import comments, track-
backs, categories, or users. WordPress.com currently does not allow you 
to import blog data via an RSS feed; this function works only with the self-
hosted WordPress.org platform.
Refer to Table A-2, earlier in this chapter, for the steps required to create the 
file you need to import via RSS. Then follow these steps:
 
1. On the Import page in the WordPress Administration panel, click the 
RSS link.
 
 You find the instructions to import your RSS file, as shown in Figure A-6.
 
2. Click the Browse button on the Import RSS page.
 
 A window opens, listing the files on your computer.
 
3. Double-click the export file you saved earlier from your RSS feed.
 
4. Click the Upload File and Import button.
 
 The import script does its magic and then reloads the page with a confir-
mation message that the process is complete.

Finding Other Import Resources
The WordPress Codex has a long list of other available scripts, plugins, work-
arounds, and outright hacks for importing from other blog platforms. You 
can find that information at http://codex.wordpress.org/Importing_
Content.
Note, however, that the WordPress Codex is run by a group of volunteers. 
When you refer to the Codex, be aware that not everything listed in it is nec-
essarily up to date or accurate, including import information (or any other 
information about running your WordPress blog).

Discover why bloggers love 
WordPress and make your 
blog the best it can be
Blogs are as much a part of life today as the evening 
newspaper was fifty years ago, and for much the same 
reason: Inquiring minds want to know. WordPress powers 
some of the most popular blogs on the Web, and with 
this guide to help, it can work for you, too. Here’s what 
WordPress does, how to set it up and use it, and some cool 
bells and whistles to make your blog stand out.
•  Pick your flavor — decide whether to use the WordPress.com 
hosted service or self-host your blog with WordPress.org
•  Customization — discover CSS and template tags and how to use 
them to create your own unique style 
•  Blogging 101 — find out about archiving, interacting with 
readers through comments, tracking back, and handling spam
•  Host with the most — get the scoop on domain registration, Web 
hosting providers, basic tools like FTP, and more
•  Do it yourself — install WordPress.org, set up a MySQL® 
database, explore RSS feeds, and organize a blogroll
•  Beef up your blog — insert audio, video, images, and photos
•  Think theme — discover where to find WordPress themes, 
explore various options, and work with template tags to create a 
unique look
