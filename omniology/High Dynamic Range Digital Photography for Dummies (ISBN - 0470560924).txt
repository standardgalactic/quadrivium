Introduction
H
igh dynamic range (HDR) digital photography is a technical and artistic 
leap forward from traditional photography. It has become so popular 
because it solves a lot of photographic exposure problems and, in the end, 
looks really cool. Images captured and processed with HDR techniques con-
tain a much wider range of light than standard photos.
Normally, shadows and bright areas in a single photo are linked. For example, 
if you set your camera to lighten shadows in a landscape, the sky gets too 
bright. If you turn down the exposure so the sky looks good, details are lost 
in the darker areas of the photo. Although you can push and pull exposure 
in software, there is a practical limit to what looks good because you literally 
run out of data.
HDR increases the amount of data by using more than one source photo. 
You take the photos through a process called bracketing. Each photo in the 
bracketed set has a different brightness. Special software combines the 
photos and allows you to control how the end result looks. When it’s all 
said and done, you have a lot of control over that look. You can choose to 
emphasize realism, details, contrast, artistry, drama, and more.
About This Book
Whether you’re coming to HDR because you love photography and want to 
expand your skill set, you’re taking a photography class and have to com-
plete a project on HDR, you’re trying to impress your girlfriend or boyfriend, 
or you have a new camera and want to do something special with it, this 
book is for you.
This book covers the big picture aspects, workflow suggestions, small picture 
items, tips, notes, steps, thoughts, photos, and more — all designed to show 
you how HDR works, and how to shoot it, process it, and finish your images.
Who This Book Is For
You’re a perfect match for this book if you want information on HDR. The 
subject is HDR, from beginning to end. Topics include what HDR is, what 
you need, how to shoot it, how to process it, and how to edit and finish 
your images.

2
High Dynamic Range Digital Photography For Dummies 
In terms of content, this book is for beginners to more advanced 
photographers — amateurs and professionals. I don’t write from a scien-
tific, technical, or otherwise overly nerdy perspective. Frankly, you don’t 
need to know the exact dynamic range of your compact digital camera or 
dSLR to know that in practice, it isn’t enough. You don’t need to know how 
many bits you need or why 12-bit sensors have 4,096 steps of tonal discrim-
ination. That said, I don’t intend this book to be strictly for new and inex-
perienced users. There’s room to grow and room to step in if you already 
know your way around a dSLR.
Although the content ranges from beginner to advanced material (I would 
call using a light meter to set the end points of a bracketed series of shots 
advanced material), the book is written so beginners don’t get overwhelmed. 
I make it a point to explain and buffer the material so inexperienced photog-
raphers have a chance, but I don’t alter the content unnecessarily to exclude 
more advanced photogs.
What You Need
If you want to dive in and start shooting HDR, you want to have a few things 
handy (see Chapters 2 and 3 for more details):
 
✓ Camera: If you have a compact digital camera with exposure control, 
you’re set. It helps (although not required) to have a dSLR with a nice 
wide angle lens.
 
✓ Tripod: If you have a fast dSLR, you can get by without a tripod occa-
sionally. Tripods are necessary, though, to stabilize your camera when 
you’re shooting brackets.
 
✓ Computer: HDR requires that you have a computer. It can be Mac or 
Windows (or Unix, but I don’t really go there), desktop or laptop.
 
✓ Software: The least you need is an HDR application. Go online and 
download a trial version to get started, and buy it if you like it. Other 
photo-editing software, such as Photoshop Elements, is invaluable when 
it comes to editing and publishing but not strictly required for HDR.
Foolish Assumptions
HDR pulls together a lot of different elements from photography and photo 
editing. That makes it impossible to cover every aspect of HDR from the 
ground up in this book — how to use a dSLR, photography, Raw conversion 
and editing, digital image manipulation in general (Photoshop Elements in 
particular), and participating in online photo forums like Flickr.

3
 Introduction
In writing this book, I made some assumptions about you, the reader:
 
✓ You know how to use your camera. You can enter different shooting 
modes, take photos, and download them to your computer. The more 
knowledge and practical experience you have (up to a point), the better.
 
✓ You can do some basic tasks with photo editing software. You’ve used 
a photo editor (such as Elements), and you’re comfortable doing some 
basic editing: adjusting brightness/contrast, cropping, and resizing.
Whys and Wherefores
This is where I explain some of the hard decisions I made about the book and 
how I approached it:
 
✓ Why Photomatix Pro? It’s the leading HDR application, and a very good 
one, which is why I chose it to show you how to generate HDR images 
and tone map them. (In Chapter 3, I provide reviews and links to many 
other HDR applications and encourage you to test them out for yourself.)
 
✓ Why Photoshop Elements? It’s the leading consumer-level photo editing 
suite. It’s good and gets the job done. It is more limited than Photoshop, 
but more accessible (and much less expensive).
 
 For users of other products (such as Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo), the 
techniques I show are still valuable and as portable as I could make 
them. However, some tasks and tools might need a bit of translation.
 
✓ Why dSLRs? Gotcha. This is a trick question. I’ve gone out of my way 
to avoid assuming everyone who reads this book is using a dSLR. I use 
a dSLR most of the time, but I also use two compact digital cameras to 
show that if you can point and shoot with it, you can shoot HDR with it. 
So, everyone can play; just bring what you have.
How This Book Is Organized
HDR isn’t rocket science. You take pictures. You transmogrify pictures. You 
edit and publish the pictures. That makes sense, so it’s the order I chose to 
organize the information contained in this book. HDR jumps around a bit 
from photography to software, so knowing where you are in the book can 
also help you keep your bearings in the realm of HDR.
The book has lots of elements designed to help you navigate between parts, 
which contain information related to the same basic topic. Chapters deal 
with specific topics. You can also use the Table of Contents or Index to find 
exactly what you want.

High Dynamic Range Digital Photography For Dummies 
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography
Part I is about getting started. If you know nothing about HDR, start here. If 
you already have some idea or have even started experimenting with HDR, 
this part gives you a lot of good information on workflow, cameras, gear, and 
software options. There’s something for everyone.
Find out what HDR is, what it looks like, and how to go about it. Discover 
what photography gear you need and why. Find out what gear is beneficial 
but not required. Explore different software options for HDR, such as dedi-
cated HDR software, image management, Raw conversion, and image editing 
applications.
Part II: Putting the Photography 
in HDR Photography
Part II is all about taking photos. Discover how to find the scenes to maximize 
the benefits of HDR and set up your camera to shoot HDR photos. Discover 
several different techniques to meter and shoot exposure bracketed photos. 
Find out when to break the rules and take single Raw photos to use as 
pseudo-HDR.
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR
Part III turns to the software side of HDR, where the photos are turned into 
HDR images, tone mapped, edited, and published. These are technical and 
artistic processes that require specialized software — and guess who has 
to know how to use it. That’s right: You. It goes beyond using it, of course, 
because you surely want to create something nice to look at.
This part is also about taking what comes out of the “tone mapper,” making it 
look as good as it can, and finishing it. I show you layers; workflow; blending; 
correcting contrast, removing dust, distortion, noise, and other distractions; 
and more. You also discover the importance of consistency, sharpening, 
enhancing color, contrast, dodging and burning, recomposing, and finally, 
publishing your images. Pshew!
Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images
And now for some fun! This part covers some interesting and potentially 
challenging ways to go even further with HDR photography. You find out 
how to photograph the pieces of a panorama, and then stitch them together 
to create a seamless composite. You also discover how to take color photos 
with a digital camera and turn them into black-and-white HDR images. (Black 
and white can be a great way to showcase some of your photos and create 
powerful, dramatic shots.)

 Introduction
Part V: The Part of Tens
Many For Dummies fans (myself included) eagerly look forward to leafing 
through the Part of Tens. That’s why I held nothing back: no filler here. I 
strove for practical ideas that I expect to stimulate your thinking. This part 
is a resource you can turn to again and again for ideas on how to take better 
photos for HDR and how to avoid ruining them. Sounds like fun!
Icons Used in This Book
I use the following icons throughout the book to make certain information 
stand out from the rest. If you want a fun (and different) experience, leaf 
through the book and focus on one type of icon at a time.
 
Tips are fun. They’re practical. They’re helpful. I include as many as I can 
get away with to try and share my experiences with you. They normally con-
tain what I think is the best way to do something, or perhaps a road to avoid. 
Tips — making your life easier, one step at a time (cue goofy music).
 
Remember icons highlight helpful bits of information — things for you to 
remember. It’s sort of like a Star Trek mind meld from Spock in the Wrath of 
Kahn. Remember.
 
When I have to include some technical information, I warn you with these 
icons. You don’t have to memorize them or understand what’s going on to 
accomplish the task at hand, but they make interesting background reading.
 
If this were Snake Charming For Dummies or Nitroglycerine For Dummies, 
Warning icons would literally be life-preserving suggestions. As it is, you 
should pay attention to Warning icons because they will save you time and 
frustration if you heed them. I have tried to keep them to a minimum. When 
you see one, read it.
Where to Go from Here
You can read this book back to front, sideways, inside out, or from the first 
to the last page. If you’re completely new to all aspects of HDR, I suggest you 
follow the basic order of the chapters, but feel free to jump around whenever 
you want to.

Part I
The ABCs of HDR 
Photography

In this part . . .
H
ey, you have to start somewhere. This is the 
place to ﬁ nd out what HDR is, how it differs 
from traditional photography, and what you need 
to get started.
Chapter 1 gets you started. You’ll see HDR in 
action and look at several examples of “before and 
after” photos to see why there’s such a fuss over 
HDR. I sneak in some macro-level HDR workﬂ ow 
on you, too. Chapter 2 is where you ﬁ nd out what 
you need to have in terms of photography gear 
(cameras, lenses, tripods, levels, plus a lot of 
other stuff), what each item brings to HDR, and 
why you should consider buying it. Chapter 3, 
being the third chapter, is the chapter that brings 
the software side of HDR into focus. I walk you 
through the different types of software that enable 
you to create HDR images on your computer and 
help you edit or manage them. I also review some 
HDR-speciﬁ c applications.

In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the HDR process
▶ Diving into a basic workflow
▶ Seeing examples of HDR images
▶ Becoming infected with excitement
R
ather than start this book with a pedantic definition of high dynamic 
range (HDR) photography followed by a technical treatise on why digi-
tal camera sensors don’t capture the actual range of light in most scenes, I 
want you to see it in action. After all, HDR photography is first and foremost 
about the photos.
Déjà vu alert: HDR photography is about the photos.
The technical information behind why HDR has been 
developed may or may not be meaningful to you down 
the road, but you can’t be expected to make the deci-
sion to jump into HDR photography on the basis 
of bit depths, contrast ratios, and sensor noise. I 
haven’t left you high and dry though. There are as 
many HDR images and examples throughout the 
book that I could fit in to help you see the HDR dif-
ference and decide whether or not you want to try 
it out.
You need to see HDR in action and examine the types 
of images you can create with it. Afterward, if you want 
to know why a 12-bit sensor can capture only 4,096 levels 
of gray and how that’s insufficient for most scenes, you’ll be 
able to put that into practical perspective.
This chapter, then, shines the light on HDR with a little bit of show and tell.

Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
Peeking inside the HDR Process
HDR photography is an exercise in capturing more light than your camera 
wants to. As I show you throughout this chapter, today’s digital cameras 
have a problem with dark darks and bright brights in the same scene. 
It throws them a bit wacky. “Traditional” pictures often don’t tell the 
whole story.
HDR photography — also called HDR imaging (HDRI) — is a two-tiered 
process that attempts to
 
1. Capture as much of the true 
dynamic range of a scene as 
practical (or possible, or artisti-
cally desirable).
 
2. Process the result with special-
ized software to produce an 
image file that can be printed 
and viewed using standard 
graphics, Web, and publishing 
software.
Figure 1-1 is an example of what you 
can create with HDR.
HDR photography is not monolithic. 
A number of caveats, disclaimers, 
and personal preferences affect the 
process of HDR in all areas. However, 
certain established aspects of HDR 
make it HDR.
The twin peaks of HDR
As I just mentioned, HDR photography is a twofold process. You take pic-
tures; you process pictures. Everything revolves around or is a part of these 
two activities. Each pillar (to continue mixing metaphors) builds a different 
part of the foundation:
 
✓ Photography: HDR photography isn’t something you can do from the 
confines of your office chair or Barcalounger. It begins with photogra-
phy. Without pictures, you don’t have HDR. However, you don’t have to

 Chapter 1: Shining a Light on HDR
travel to exotic places to shoot. You can exploit HDR to its fullest with 
landscape, architecture, and everyday subjects easily found in your own 
backyard and local community.
 
 For more information on setting up your camera and taking pictures, 
please see Chapters 4–6, plus Chapter 12.
 
✓ Software processing: HDR relies on a combination of software; some are 
specific to HDR, and some serve more general purposes as well as help-
ing you create HDR. Without software processing, you don’t have HDR.
 
 For more information on the software aspects of HDR, please see 
Chapters 7–11.
Going with the (work)flow
HDR photography can be somewhat confusing if you aren’t familiar with the 
basic flow of events. In general, here is what you dutifully do when you do 
the HDR you do and the order that you do it in.
 
1. Take the photos.
 
 This is the first, and arguably most important, step in HDR. Don’t be con-
tent with average photos. Take good or even great photos.
 
 Much of the time, you’ll set your camera on a tripod at the scene of 
your choice and take a series of exposure bracketed photos. Bracketing 
means you take a few pictures with different exposure values without 
moving the camera, resulting in a series of bracketed photos. The suc-
cession of Figure 1-2 shows an example of bracketing. You can see from 
these three brackets that each one preserves an important part of the 
overall dynamic range of the scene. This is pretty important. Although 
the under- and overexposed photos aren’t pretty to look at, the HDR 
application uses the information from all the brackets to sense what 
each part of the scene actually looks like. HDR software works with all 
the information you can give it.
 
 If your camera is fast enough, you might be able to take bracketed 
photos without a tripod. This is called hand-held HDR.
 
 The exception to bracketing is when you take one Raw photo for use in 
single-exposure HDR. Raw photos are best to work with, but JPEGs can 
also produce good results.
 
2. Do Raw photo preprocessing.
 
 For the highest quality results, convert Raw photos to TIFFs before pro-
ceeding with HDR.

12
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
Figure 1-2: Bracketed photos capture more light.

13
 Chapter 1: Shining a Light on HDR
 
3. Generate an HDR image in HDR software.
 
 HDR software merges the bracketed photos into a single HDR image that 
serves no practical purpose other than to turn into something else.
 
4. Tone map the HDR image in HDR software.
 
 By itself, the HDR image isn’t worth much. Until everyone is using HDR 
monitors and printers, you have to tone map (the process of deciding 
what data from the original photos is kept in the final image and making 
sure it fits) the HDR image to convert HDR data into a low dynamic range 
space.
 
 Yes, you do all these steps to get back where you started — a low 
dynamic range image — kinda. The key difference is that this image was 
created from a much wider range of original data, making completely dif-
ferent and beautiful processing options available.
 
5. Finish with post-HDR processing.
 
 The image you just tone mapped often needs further attention. For 
example, it might have noise problems, or need straightened or 
cropped. You might also wish to convert your image to black and white, 
or otherwise embellish it by adjusting levels, tweaking the contrast, or 
dodging and burning.
 
6. Publish the image.
 
 You can see the result in Figure 1-3. The final product was a result of 
photography and software skills applied to capture and present an inter-
esting view down a major street with traffic barreling down on me just 
like you were there with me.

Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
HDR Show and Tell
The most effective way to show you the practical benefits of HDR digital 
photography is for you to see what photos look like before and after being 
processed as HDR. You’ll discover a little bit of the why along the way, with 
the rest of the book completing the picture. I chose several types of scenes to 
illustrate the breadth and depth of HDR, ranging from interiors to sunsets to 
my son to a soap bubble. Here, let me show you.
Rescuing details from shadows
One of the things HDR is meant to do is bring details out of shadowy areas. 
The photo in Figure 1-4 looks west at sunset. The sky is reasonably light, and 
you can make out the clouds and the glow from the sun. These elements also 
reflect off the water of the river in the foreground.
Figure 1-4: A sunset with a dark foreground.
Unfortunately, the trees, riverbank, and details of the building are all in 
shadow. The camera can’t capture enough dynamic range — the total range 
of light in a scene — to accurately represent it. Standing there, the actual 
scene was much brighter. The disconnect between reality and the photo-
graph is that digital still cameras do not see scenes the way our eyes do.
 
The reasons cameras have limited dynamic range are many. Camera manu-
facturers are currently unable (due to the fact that not everything is possi-
ble) or unwilling (they have to stay in business so not everything that is 
possible is practical) to cross scientific, technical, design, and manufacturing 
barriers, including

15
 Chapter 1: Shining a Light on HDR
 
✓ The bit depth the sensor uses to store data
 
✓ The inherent noise level of the camera system and how it affects the sen-
sor’s ability to measure light
 
✓ How digital systems simply react to light differently than our eyes do
The effect, more often than not, is that a camera compromises when it mea-
sures the exposure of a scene. It has to. In this case, rather than make the sky 
too bright, the camera made it just bright enough and relegated the rest of 
the scene to the shadows.
Figure 1-5 shows the same scene in HDR. Notice the huge difference across 
the photo, particularly in the previously dark areas. The trees are now clearly 
green. The sky and clouds have more definition and the building has discern-
able details. Much better!
The secret to creating the new look is twofold. First, HDR photography cap-
tures a much wider range of exposure information using brackets. This gives 
the software much more information to use. Highlights that are normally too 
bright are captured so they aren’t overblown. The same goes for shadows. In 
software, you tone map the source material (which has too wide a range of 
brightness to display or use as a standard image), squeeze it so it fits in a stan-
dard image, and make creative decisions that define the relative brightness of 
parts of the scene. After this, you can make other adjustments and enhance-
ments (such as brightness, contrast, color, noise, sharpness, recomposing, 
cropping, and resizing) in a photo editor such as Photoshop Elements.
Figure 1-5: In the same sunset shot, HDR brightens the shadows.

16
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
 
This example illustrates a few interesting points:
 
✓ Losing the low end of dynamic range: Digital cameras often lose details 
in shadows. This is caused by the camera’s inability to capture the full 
range of light in a scene. This range is called dynamic range.
 
✓ Compromises: Cameras make compromises on what to expose well and 
what to let go. You can help the situation by metering the scene and 
subject correctly — but scenes with a wide dynamic range can’t be faith-
fully captured by today’s cameras.
 
✓ Rescuing details from shadows: HDR photography allows you to pull 
meaningful information out of shadows so the areas are brighter.
Taming highlights
Another strength of HDR is the ability to tame highlights, which are often blown 
out in traditional photos — that is, the camera ran out of room to store bright-
ness information. When that happens, the camera sensor throws its hands up 
in the air and exclaims, “¡No más!” The blown areas have very little detail and 
may be completely white, as in the sky of the left image in Figure 1-6.
Figure 1-6: Lucy in the sky, with brightness.

17
 Chapter 1: Shining a Light on HDR
In the left image, the street, bridge, and lamppost in the foreground are all 
decently exposed although not perfectly — they are, along with the trees, a 
bit dark. The sky is the bigger problem: It suffers from being mostly dead — 
that is, blown out. It’s too light to see many details, especially over the build-
ing to the right.
The camera got caught in the middle. It ended up favoring the foreground 
(although imperfectly) and therefore blew out the sky.
However, the same scene shot and processed as HDR is shown on the right 
side of Figure 1-6. It is overwhelmingly better. In particular, the sky has many 
more details and is no longer washed out. The brackets provide the informa-
tion and the HDR application uses them to access and manipulate the data. 
The clouds are dramatic, and the contrast between clouds and sky is much 
more interesting. This particular look — somewhat dramatic with plenty 
of surface details — was achieved during tone mapping, which is covered 
in Chapters 8 and 9. The trees are nice and bright, and the texture of the 
concrete bridge has been enhanced. The latter points used many of the edit-
ing techniques shown in Chapters 10 and 11. In particular, the tree line was 
dodged — a process that selectively lightens an area.
This shot reveals
 
✓ The high end of dynamic range: Normal photos often lose information 
to blown highlights. When the camera exposes the shadows brighter, 
highlights get blown out. It’s a no-win situation.
 
✓ Rescuing details from blown highlights: HDR tames highlights and pre-
serves important information. It allows you to emphasize details and con-
trast while preserving the entire scene. The entire photo looks better.
Making the most of interior spaces
HDR is perfectly suited for interior spaces — and the larger the better. Figure 
1-7 illustrates the sanctuary of a large church lit with overhead room chande-
liers, a few spots on the stage, and ambient light coming in from the windows.
This is a great example of a compromised exposure. The camera is doing the 
best it can, but it is stuck in the middle. The result is a dark looking room 
that should be brighter and bright areas around the lights and windows that 
should be the same or darker. It is the worst of both worlds.
And neither of the following two courses of action, illustrated in Figure 1-8, 
are attractive:
 
✓ Dinged if you do: Raising the ISO or slowing the shutter speed to make 
the room brighter (raising the exposure) only serves to blow out the 
highlights even more, as you can see in the left side of Figure 1-8. Rigging 

18
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
additional lighting to brighten the room would either be too expensive 
or cumbersome, not to mention that you couldn’t possibly hide the 
lighting gear from this vantage point.
 
✓ Donked if you don’t: Protecting the highlights around the chandeliers 
and windows requires decreasing the exposure. The problem is that 
everything that already looks a bit on the dark side slides further into 
darkness if you do that. Check out the right side of Figure 1-8. You are 
left with a picture of a few bright spots in a dark room.
Figure 1-7: Inside a large space with no extra lighting.
Overexposed
Underexposed
Figure 1-8: Two exposures show the horns of the dilemma.

19
 Chapter 1: Shining a Light on HDR
HDR solves both these problems nicely, as shown in Figure 1-9. The entire 
room looks brighter and more vibrant, and the light from the windows has 
not overpowered the photo. In other words, the best parts of each of the 
bracketed photos contributes to the final image. The decisions you make that 
control how this occurs is what tone mapping (Chapters 8 and 9) is all about. 
Although some post-HDR processing techniques helped achieve this effect, 
tone mapping is the single greatest contributor to the overall appearance of 
this image.
Figure 1-9: HDR solves this exposure problem.
Tone whating?
It’s impossible to talk about HDR without touch-
ing on tone mapping, because that’s what gives 
each HDR image a unique look. In HDR, you 
create an HDR image from bracketed photos 
first (see Chapter 7). Much more brightness 
data is stored (you know, what’s in the shadows 
and what’s in the highlights) in an HDR image 
than is possible in standard image formats like 
JPEG or TIFF (even a 16-bit per channel TIFF). 
That makes an HDR image impractical to use. 
You can’t view it properly on your monitor or 
print it out. So, you have to tone map it (see 
Chapters 8 and 9).
Tone mapping occurs in HDR software. Different 
applications handle it differently, but the general 
principle is that you control how data from the 
HDR image gets put into a low dynamic range 
format. You get to choose specific tone mapping 
settings that can create entirely different looks 
in different images. The end result is a TIFF or 
JPEG — something you can continue to edit in 
a graphics program, publish, or print.

20
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
This photo shows you
 
✓ Flexibility: HDR can work in situations where extra lighting is needed to 
achieve a better exposure. This is especially helpful for large buildings 
(which are impossible to light without owning a movie company), land-
scapes, cityscapes, and large interiors.
 
✓ Color: When more of the scene’s dynamic range is present, brought to 
you by HDR, its true colors are free to come out. This is far preferable to 
the dull original.
 
✓ Post-HDR processing: It’s often important to continue to edit a tone 
mapped HDR image to create a finished product. Even with bracketing 
and tone mapping, the windows were still a bit too bright. An under-
exposed bracket was used to tone down the windows even more. That 
option would not be available without the brackets.
Enhancing details
HDR works well for large scenes, but it also enhances smaller subjects that 
have lots of detail. Figure 1-10 shows the ceiling in the lobby of the historic 
Tower Bank in Fort Wayne, Indiana. You can see potential here. The top part 
of the figure hints that underneath the dullness, there promises to be an 
interesting work of art. Hints of color and detail are tantalizingly close to the 
surface, yet the local details are ill-defined, and the texture and colors are 
monotonous.
What often gets lost in the rush to say how much more dynamic range is cap-
tured by HDR is the fact that it accentuates textures so beautifully. You’ll find 
it works wonders on wood, brick, stone, rust, gravel, and yes, even animal fur.
HDR brings out the subtlety and small nuances with a sledgehammer, as seen 
in the bottom part of Figure 1-10. It’s fascinating, intriguing, compelling, and 
telling. It’s shocking, I tell you. Shocking.
HDR uses exposure information gathered from a range of photos to enhance 
the local contrast so you can see the true details. These details aren’t made 
up. This isn’t a visual or processing trick. They are actually there, but tradi-
tional digital photography has a hard time finding them.
 
✓ Details: Poorly exposed photos lacking in dynamic range hide details 
that are often visible with the naked eye.
 
✓ Details!: HDR removes the “haze” from the original photo by capturing 
more light than the original. This brings out intricate and fascinating 
details. Contrast enhancements accentuate texture differences.
 
✓ Details!!: Colors shine when let loose by HDR. Tonal variations are much 
more visible.

 Chapter 1: Shining a Light on HDR

Working wonders with people
Most people think of landscapes, cityscapes, and other photos of inanimate 
objects when they think of HDR. I want to challenge you to try it with people 
as your subject(s).
It’s not the same as traditional HDR because you don’t capture a series of 
photos. You shoot a single Raw photo. This is because it is impractical or 
impossible to get people to sit motionless. My kids barely stay in one spot for 
1/500 of a second without moving!
 
What makes this possible are Raw photos and a little bit of trickery. Take 
a good photo in Raw (not JPEG) and send that through your HDR software 
as if it were a bracketed set and then tone map the result. You can create 

22
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
your own brackets from the single Raw photo and send those to your 
HDR application if you like. (Flip over to Chapters 6 and 7 for information 
on this.)
 
In the end, you’re not increasing the dynamic range of your camera by shoot-
ing multiple shots. However, you do end up with something that looks very 
close to HDR.
This process has alternatively been called pseudo-HDR, single-exposure HDR, 
or simply tone mapping a low dynamic range image. Whatever you call it, 
here’s an example. The left side of Figure 1-11 illustrates a reasonably good 
JPEG of one of my sons, straight out of the camera. It’s a good portrait, but 
the sun is shining on his face from the left side. It’s a classic case of the 
dreaded face shadow.
 
The original Raw exposure was processed through the Sony Image Data 
Converter five times to create five images with different exposures, from dark 
to light. This Raw converter enables you to save Sony Raw photos as JPEGs 
or TIFFs after you make adjustments to lighting, contrast, color, sharpness, 
and noise — see Chapter 7 for more information on Raw conversion. This 
process squeezes every bit of dynamic range in the photo to the surface.
Figure 1-11: Harsh shadows often plague portraits.
Converting single exposures to brackets doesn’t increase the dynamic range 
of the original, but it does bring out the entire range of exposure information 
more for you to see it better.

23
 Chapter 1: Shining a Light on HDR
Those images were processed as HDR and tone mapped. The result is shown 
in the right side of Figure 1-11. Apart from the entire photo looking better and 
more vibrant, the shadows on the face are less distracting.
This example illustrates
 
✓ People problems: Cameras often have a 
hard time photographing people without a 
flash or additional lighting. This normally 
results in backlit subjects or shadows that 
cross the face. If you use a flash, you pay for 
it with harsh shadows and blazingly bright 
foreheads such as the nearby figure (and 
yes, I’ve got all sorts of bad shots in my 
photo archives waiting to be published).
 
✓ HDR and people: HDR can work with 
people. If you let the tone mapping controls 
like Strength and Smoothing (you’ll get to 
them in Chapters 8 and 9) get out of hand, 
the person may look horrible. A fine touch, however, will reward you 
with a more vibrant photo than the original.
 
✓ Single-exposure HDR: Although not technically HDR (because you’re 
only shooting one limited dynamic range photo), you can use single Raw 
exposures as source images for pseudo-HDR.
Within and without
During a nice, brightly lit day, take your camera and go to a room where you 
work or live that has a window in it. Without using a flash or any other expo-
sure aids, try to take a photograph where the inside and the outside are both 
properly exposed. Turn the inside lights off and on to see whether it makes a 
difference. Put the camera in Auto mode or use different metering and expo-
sure strategies if you like.
You’re not going to have much success, especially if you don’t use some seri-
ous interior lighting to balance the brightness of the interior with the outside. 
The problem is again dynamic range, pure and simple. Today’s digital cam-
eras can’t capture a dim interior and a bright exterior without messing some-
thing up, as shown in Figure 1-12.
In this case, both areas suffer. As you can see on the left side of Figure 1-12, 
the outside is blown out with details barely visible. The inside is completely 
dark. You would think I was standing in a dark room photographing the sur-
face of the sun through the revolving door! Nothing could be further from 
the truth.

24
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
Figure 1-12: Seeing inside and out with HDR.
Your eyes don’t see this, of course. What you see in person is a well-balanced 
scene with a high dynamic range. If you were standing there, the room would 
look normally lit. The outside would look normal. Or, to put it another way, 
you see something like the right side of Figure 1-12, which is the scene in 
HDR. (It is perhaps artistically embellished a smidgen, but not so much as to 
make it unrecognizable.)
I hope you can see that
 
✓ Cameras struggle with inside-out shots. The dynamic range in this 
example, from a darker but well-lit interior to a very bright exterior, is 
huge. It’s impossible to capture the entire range of this scene in one digi-

✓ Reality is not always well represented. Traditional photographs aren’t 
necessarily a good indicator of reality, despite what some people will 
tell you. If you doubt that, find a location like this and compare what you 
see with your eyes to a photograph.
Feeding your starving inner artist
HDR excels at many things and certainly solves a great number of common 
exposure and dynamic range problems. That satisfies those people who think 
with the right side of their brains. Another group (they often cross over), 
however, shoot HDR just because it looks cool. These people aren’t con-
strained by a rigid set of rules or procedures: They’re artists.

 Chapter 1: Shining a Light on HDR
The left image in Figure 1-13 is a photograph of a bubble, floating in the 
breeze. The camera wasn’t set up on a tripod, and bracketed exposures 
weren’t taken. It’s not necessarily the greatest scene for HDR.
What this base photo has going for it, though, is that it’s an interesting picture. 
Even as a traditional photo, it pulls you in. The problem is, you want more.
Figure 1-13: A bubble shot in Raw format and transformed.
The right image of Figure 1-13 is the “more.” The result illustrates how capti-
vating HDR can be — even when relying on a single exposure.
This photo benefits from parts of the HDR process just like the other exam-
ples in this chapter. The details of the bubble are clean and clear because the 
software accentuates the contrast between different bands of the bubble. In 
addition, the colors are much more vibrant.
This example shows
 
✓ Left brain: HDR doesn’t always have to be the solution to a problem. 
Sometimes it can just be artistic.
 
✓ Right brain: There are important technical facets of HDR, and even an 
artistic expression can serve a logical purpose.
 
✓ All skate: There’s room for us all. It’s a big tent. Come on in!

Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
Getting Excited about HDR Photography
There’s a lot to HDR photography. One of the things that makes it most inter-
esting is that it has elements that appeal to whatever side of your brain you 
use most, or both. If you’re a technically minded photographer, HDR offers you 
a serious tool to pursue all the dynamic range you can shake a stick at. If you 
want to shoot HDR because it looks cool, you’re in good company, too. HDR 
also has the depth to interest artists and craftsmen, dreamers and realists.
As you continue to discover HDR photography, consider where you want to 
take it and how to get there. These topics are a good place to start:
 
✓ Deciding what you want to create: Think about what you like to shoot, 
how much effort you want to put into it, and what generally floats your 
boat. Let your passion for photography guide you into HDR, and don’t 
be afraid to diversify your interests.
 
✓ Discovering your comfort level: HDR photography should fit within the 
boundaries of your life. That doesn’t mean you should take it easy and 
not push yourself. It means you don’t have to let it take over your life.
 
 Given certain adjustments, HDR should fit within the time and money 
parameters that you set. Decide what level of effort makes you happy, 
and then get out there and do it!
 
✓ Costing it out: Taking digital photos costs very little. Compared with 
ye olden days, you don’t have to buy rolls of film and pay to have the 
photos developed. That alone makes today’s pursuit of photography 
very enjoyable. Take 2,000 photos over a weekend if you want to!
 
 You do, however, have to buy a camera, memory cards, batteries, other 
gear, and have a computer and the software to make HDR work.
 
✓ Defining your workflow: Workflow is a buzzword in the digital photo 
world, and for good reason. It just buzzes. Bzzzzz. Bzzzz. There is a 
distinct workflow to HDR (shown in this chapter and in the basic organi-
zation of this book), but within the overall framework, there are plenty 
of options (details of which are contained throughout). Find what is 
comfortable for you.
 
✓ Experimenting: Don’t get yourself too tied down to a particular way 
of doing things to the exclusion of all others. Experiment. Try different 
lenses, approaches, techniques, styles. Stay fresh!
 
✓ Growing: Did you know that growth is a growth industry? Yeah, it’s fun 
to grow. It exercises your brain and keeps you happy. Whether you’re 
picking up HDR at 9 or 90, you can grow with HDR.

H
DR photography is easy to get into and fun to grow with. You don’t 
need a whole lot to get started. In fact, the least you need is a digital 
camera that allows you to control the exposure and an inexpensive tripod. 
That’s it!
And now for the fine print.
The catch is, not everything is equal. You can get started 
with a pretty inexpensive compact digital camera and 
a little tripod, but you won’t have the same flexibil-
ity, nor will you be able to consistently achieve the 
same image quality as a more professional camera 
and accessories. (The consolation prize for being 
economical is saving from a few hundred to many 
thousands of dollars.)
More capable cameras can even shoot HDR without 
a tripod. There are a million-and-one camera and 
gear choices out there. If you’re buying new, take the 
information in this chapter and use it to start off in the 
right direction. It’s a very powerful feeling to stand in a 
camera shop, fully informed, knowing what you need while 
you test different cameras (that you have read up on beforehand).

28
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
If you already have a camera but don’t shoot HDR, find out what your options 
are before running out to get a new model. Maybe you can use what you 
have and grow into HDR. You’ll be better informed when you plan your next 
purchase.
Either way, it’s time to explore all things gear, and gear is what you’re going 
to hear here.
Knowledge Is Power: Researching and 
Shopping for the Right Equipment
Use every tool at your disposal to investigate the general types of gear you’re 
interested in, and then zero in on specific makes and models. This chapter 
gives you a good start on choosing the types of gear you need, so I mention 
only a few specific models. Keep in mind, too, that because many products 
work differently, this book can’t take the place of a manual dedicated to your 
specific equipment.
When you’re shopping for equipment, use the Internet! Go to manufacturers’ 
Web sites and look through their product lines to research camera specifica-
tions. Compare and contrast. Price your options. Shop for other gear, too, 
and read reviews.
 
One word of caution on reviews: You don’t know why a person might hate or 
love a piece of gear. Maybe the reviewer is an idiot, doesn’t have any talent, 
didn’t read the manual, or learn how to use the camera or gear effectively. 
Maybe the reviewer is a paid professional who gets a kickback. Maybe the 
review is a genuine, honest assessment of the gear. You never can tell, so 
always read more than one review before deciding whether a particular 
model is right for you.
If your camera has an online manual, download it and read it. Hint: You’ll 
enjoy the ability to magnify it onscreen much larger than the tiny print in the 
one that comes with your camera.
Make friends at your local camera shop. Having a human connection can 
often make the difference between getting the right gear for you and wasting 
time and money on something that doesn’t fit your needs. They don’t expect 
you to buy everything from them, but they’ll surely appreciate your business.
It’s important to have a plan. To create that plan you need to know what 
HDR is (here and throughout the book), see different cameras, learn about 
optional gear, and know how each piece of gear will contribute to your ability 
to create HDR images.

 Chapter 2: Gearing Up for HDR
Looking at Hand-Held Photon Capture 
Devices (Err, Cameras)
Choosing your camera is the best place to begin when you’re buying equip-
ment for HDR photography. The following sections look at the different 
camera types and what they bring to the table.
HDR is about controlling and manipulating exposure. You must control expo-
sure to shoot bracketed photos of a scene, as shown in Figure 2-1. To compli-
cate things, there are a number of different ways to control exposure. Some 
are obvious, and others are less so.
Brackets
Final HDR 
photo
Figure 2-1: Control exposure to achieve bracketing.
Different cameras tend to have different methods and modes of exposure 
control. (If you aren’t familiar with some of the camera or exposure terms in 
the following list, check out Chapter 4.) You need to investigate whether the 
camera you want to buy (or the camera you have) has at least one of the fol-
lowing exposure controls:
 
✓ Manual exposure mode: You won’t necessarily be looking for a new 
camera with manual mode for HDR (look for a good AEB feature 
instead). If you’re dusting off a camera you already have, manual mode 
makes it HDR-compatible. The only drawback is shooting speed.
 
✓ Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB): Using AEB frees you from turning 
dials and changing the exposure in the middle of a bracketed set. The 
camera does all the work for you. (Cough: hence, the term auto.)
 
 This is what you want to look for in a camera to shoot HDR. AEB is the 
fastest way to shoot brackets. Not all AEB is created equal, however. 
Cameras with AEB that shoot a total range of at least +/– 5.0 EV for the 
bracketed set give you good exposure coverage. Some take more photos 
with a larger exposure difference between them and some take less.
 
 Bottom line: If you have AEB, you’re in for faster, accurate, less stressful 
HDR photography than any other method.

30
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
 
✓ Exposure compensation: This method of shooting HDR turns virtually 
any camera into an HDR machine. In other words, you can take the inex-
pensive compact digital you already have and start shooting HDR with 
it right now — you don’t have to run out and buy a new camera until 
you’re ready.
 
You need only one of the features in the preceding list to shoot bracketed 
HDR. Some cameras have all three, and some have one or two. Others poorly 
implement some combination or another.
Notice something missing from the preceding list? How about the Raw file 
format? It’s not the least you need to have, although it helps. Raw photos give 
you greater control, more dynamic range, and more upside. However, you can 
use plain ol’ JPEGs for HDR. The only time you must have Raw photos is when 
you want to shoot single-shot HDR, which is covered more fully in Chapter 6.
Inexpensive compact cameras
Compact digital cameras (sometimes called digital point-and-shoot cameras) are 
the cheapest entry into HDR. You can buy one for about $100 and start your 
HDR career without having to get a second mortgage on your home.
Here are some models that can fit 
the bill. The Nikon Coolpix S220 and 
Canon PowerShot A480 can shoot 
HDR by using exposure compensa-
tion. The Panasonic Lumix LZ8 is a 
little older, but it features manual 
mode and AEB. Figure 2-2 shows 
what you can achieve using this 
Panasonic model.
 
You can take great photos and have 
fun with HDR with any of these cam-
eras. The key to buying a compact 
digital camera that can handle HDR 
photography is to know what you’re 
getting and knowing the camera’s 
limitations.
To repeat, with compacts that fea-
ture manual modes and even auto 
bracketing, you’re set. You can’t 
take action shots or hand-held HDR 
because the frame rate is too slow, 
and you won’t have Raw photos to 
use for single-shot HDR.
Figure 2-2: You can certainly get great shots 
with an inexpensive camera.

31
 Chapter 2: Gearing Up for HDR
 
If your camera doesn’t have a manual mode or AEB, don’t worry — all is not 
lost. The Exposure Compensation feature on most (if not all) digital cameras 
offers you a workaround for automatic controls to change shutter speed, 
which is how you shoot manual brackets.
The benefits you’ll find if you use a compact digital camera:
 
✓ Compact: Compact digital cameras are easy to carry, hold, store, and 
shoot normal photos with “point and shoot” ease (HDR isn’t quite so 
automatic with a compact camera). Their diminutive size can make a 
difference if you don’t want to lug around a big digital single lens reflex 
(dSLR) with several lenses.
 
✓ Inexpensive: Not all compact digital cameras are easy on the wallet, of 
course, but this type of camera starts out inexpensively. You can find a 
good camera that fits your budget with little trouble.
 
✓ Multi-purpose: You can use a simple point-and-shoot for casual family 
photos during the day and HDR at sunset. These cameras are ideal to 
start your HDR career, and you can use them for many other purposes. 
They also make wonderful learning platforms to teach children about 
photography.
 
✓ Results: Purists and quality fanatics might cringe at the prospect of 
seeing HDR shot from compact digital cameras, but they work.
These are the tradeoffs you’ll find if you use a compact digital camera:
 
✓ Photo quality concerns: Compact digital camera photo quality ranges 
from surprisingly good to downright abysmal. They tend to show more 
noise, and high-ISO performance trails far behind dSLRs. This degrada-
tion of quality happens primarily because these cameras have a much 
smaller sensor.
 
 Having said this, you can take (with a decent camera, the know-how 
to use it, and good software processing skills) beautiful pictures. 
Paradoxically, without those skills, you will find it very challenging to 
take decent pictures even if you have a very high-quality, expensive 
camera.
 
✓ Small or no optical viewfinder: Many new compact digital cameras 
have no optical viewfinder. You are forced to frame and compose your 
shot on the LCD screen. Although this is fine sometimes, it’s harder to 
see what you’re doing outside in the sun. And even if your model does 
have a viewfinder, as in Figure 2-3, it’s often microscopically small — 
and, to make matters worse, it’s not a faithful representation of what 
you’re photographing. This is one reason why dSLRs are so popular 
among professionals — because you look through the lens when you 
look through the viewfinder, seeing what the camera sees.

32
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
 
✓ Small controls: Although these 
cameras are designed to be 
easy to use, they are often 
harder to use if you want to 
do anything other than put the 
camera on Auto and start taking 
pictures. Control knobs and 
buttons are tiny or nonexistent. 
This can make it hard to change 
shooting modes, aperture, focus, 
and exposure compensation.
 
✓ Restricted flexibility: One of 
the biggest strikes against 
compact digitals is the lack of 
flexibility compared with dSLRs. 
This has an effect on where and 
how you can shoot good HDR:
 
• Limited shooting modes: You will often be limited to preset scenes 
and auto modes, which restrict your ability to be in control of the 
camera.
 
• Limited focus modes: You often have no manual focus — and even 
if you do, it’s pretty hard to focus a compact digital camera on any-
thing other than the side of a barn. Too, depending on the shooting 
mode you are in, you might have a limited ability to control focus 
points. Shooting sweeping landscapes might not be a problem, but 
focusing on a small detail for HDR might be.
 
• Limited metering modes: You might be limited to one or two 
metering modes (multiple, which you should always have; center 
weighted; and possibly, spot), which can restrict your ability to set 
the best overall exposure.
 
• Single lens: This could be a pro or a con, depending on who you 
are. You can save yourself a lot of money because you won’t be 
tempted to buy new lenses. On the other hand, you can’t upgrade 
your camera with a better or different lens. Hint: If you aren’t 
happy with the angle of view (it may be too “zoomy,” or not wide 
enough), you’ll have to get another camera.
 
• No growth: These cameras are great at what they do, but when you 
master them and want to continue to grow, there is no alternative 
but to get another camera.
 
✓ JPEGs: Budget compact digital cameras do not offer Raw support. 
The only file format available is JPEG, which limits your ability to make 
pre-HDR processing decisions. This limitation can also affect photo qual-
ity. This is not an insurmountable problem, but realize that the upper 
level of quality you can achieve is limited.
Viewfinder

tiny porthole above the LCD screen.

 Chapter 2: Gearing Up for HDR
High-end compact and super-zoom cameras
Taking a step up from the budget range, you will find a wide variety of more 
expensive compact digital cameras, high-end compacts, super-zooms, and 
dSLR look-alikes. There are so many often-overlapping categories that it 
makes your head spin.
The two things this range of cameras 
have in common are their increased 
cost, and better or more features. 
Figure 2-4 shows an older Kodak 
EasyShare Z740 super-zoom. Despite 
its age and being only a 5 megapixel 
(MP) camera, it sports a manual mode 
and can help you take fantastic pic-
tures. Notice at this point you get an 
upgraded grip. Woohoo! That makes 
the camera easier to hold and use 
without getting your fingers in the way 
of the lens. Speaking of lenses, super-
zoom lenses tend to be much larger than 
budget compact digital cameras. Part of 
the reason is marketing (a larger lens looks 
more impressive) but part is functional — these lenses have to be better in order 
to make zooming in by a factor of 20x practical.
Other candidates in this category are the premium compacts Panasonic 
Lumix DMC-LX3, Canon PowerShot G10, and Nikon Coolpix 6000; super-
zooms Canon PowerShot SX1 and SX10, Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28, and the 
Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX1.
 
Super-zooms are basically compact cameras (all but the beefiest are smaller 
than a dSLR) with an impressive zoom capability that generally cost much less 
than a dSLR. The Canon PowerShot SX-20 IS, for example, puts 20x optical zoom 
at your fingertips for about $400. This is equivalent to a 560mm lens on a full-
frame (35mm) camera. To put that into perspective, the Canon EF 600mm f/4L IS 
USM super telephoto lens costs just under $10,000. The SX-IS 20 also features a 
reasonable wide-angle capability, starting out at 28mm (35mm equivalent).
Touch-screen controls
New Nikons have moved to a touch-screen 
paradigm, which isn’t the best for HDR when 
you want to keep the camera steady. Ideally, 
you should touch the camera as little as 
possible. When you must, it helps to have con-
trols at your fingertips instead of having to poke 
the screen several times.
Figure 2-4: Look for more features with a 
midrange camera.

34
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
Here are the pros of spending more money to get a more capable camera:
 
✓ Higher picture quality: Although sensor sizes are still small, the image 
quality you can get from a more expensive camera tends to be better 
than the budget line because of image stabilization and additional pro-
cessing oomph in the camera. Too, this class offers better or larger 
lenses. High-ISO performance still lags behind dSLRs, however.
 
✓ Comparable megapixels: These cameras compete well in this category. 
High-end models generally top out at 12 megapixels while more inexpen-
sive and older cameras have between 8 and 10.
 
✓ Still relatively compact: Even at this level, you can still carry around an 
amazingly small camera. For example, at only the size of a box of animal 
crackers, the Canon G10 is a serious camera with a lot of power. You can 
easily fit it in a purse or a manly European carryall (think Seinfeld).
 
✓ More controls: High-end digital compacts and the more expensive 
super-zooms offer more controls than a budget camera. Look for handy 
knobs and switches on the camera body, which make changing shooting 
modes, aperture, and shutter speed much easier.
 
✓ More manual control: You tend to garner a greater ability to manu-
ally control the camera as you spend more money. This makes manual 
bracketing (assuming no AEB mode) easier than having to resort to 
exposure compensation.
 
✓ Raw file format: At this level, the Raw file format is sometimes — albeit 
not always — an option. This is a significant reason to step up to the 
next level and purchase a more expensive camera. Although you might 
be happy with JPEGs for casual shooting, Raw photos can give you a 
boost in HDR quality. In addition, you can shoot single-exposure HDR 
using Raw photos. That opens up a whole new and exciting world.
Here are the cons of spending more money to get a more capable camera:
 
✓ Not a dSLR: As the cost rises, you approach the price of budget dSLRs 
but don’t get the same benefits. If you’re considering upgrading to a 
dSLR, seriously consider the two types of cameras and whether you 
need the super-zoom.
 
 No matter how expensive a super-zoom camera is, the camera and lens 
combined often cost less than a professional quality zoom or telephoto 
lens for a dSLR.
 
✓ Flexibility: Super-zooms tend to be single-purpose cameras. Sure, you 
can stand on the sidelines of the soccer game taking photos of little 
Timmy across the way competing his heart out. However, wide-angle 
capability is limited, which can restrict your ability to shoot certain 
scenes in HDR. High-end compacts are much more versatile.

35
 Chapter 2: Gearing Up for HDR
 
✓ Noise: Compared with dSLRs, these cameras 
have more noise, especially at higher ISOs. 
Shooting at ISO 100 can negate this problem. 
See what I mean in Figure 2-5.
dSLR cameras
If you’re serious about HDR, you will eventually 
come face to face with the dSLR. Or rather, face 
to lens. Although it’s not the only game in town, 
the dSLR is a big-league camera. Figure 2-6 shows 
an entry-level Sony Alpha 300 dSLR with a Sigma 
10-20mm F4-5.5 ultra wide angle lens mounted 
on a tripod. Makes my heart go all pitter-patter 
seeing it there.
Here are the benefits to getting a dSLR for HDR 
photography:
 
✓ Highest quality: Although dSLRs range from 
basic entry-level models to the full-frame, 
super-professional, complicated-as-a-nuclear-
reactor variety, they are the pinnacle in rea-
sonably affordable (from a few hundred to 
several thousand dollars) quality.
 
✓ Total control: dSLRs don’t skimp on control. 
You decide what you want to do and choose 
how to do it. This helps when shooting 
manual HDR brackets.
 
 Beginning photographers might find con-
trolling such a complex piece of equipment 
a bit overwhelming at first (I did), but entry-
level dSLRs offer a good mix of features that 
combine automated photography and dSLR 
power.
 
✓ Shooting flexibility: Better dSLRs offer you 
the flexibility to shoot in tough conditions 
that push the camera to its limits. With a fast 
frame rate, you can take bracketed shots of 
moving clouds without worrying that they 
will smear. Lenses are interchangeable — and with the right lens, you 
can shoot darker scenes without having to lengthen shutter speed too 
much. And although I’d avoid this, you can also raise the ISO to moder-
ate levels without paying too much of a noise penalty. (You’ll certainly 
get less noise with a dSLR than with other types of cameras.)

Compact
Figure 2-5: Smaller sensors, 
lenses, and fewer megapixels

36
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
 
✓ Growth: dSLRs offer tremen-
dous growth potential. You can 
upgrade camera bodies and 
keep the lenses you’ve invested 
in over the years as long as you 
stay within the same system.
 
✓ Raw+JPEG: Virtually all dSLRs 
allow you to save photos in the 
Raw file format, and most allow 
you to simultaneously store 
Raw+JPEG, which means the 
camera stores two files (one 
Raw, one JPEG) for every photo 
you take. This is the best of 
both worlds. You can quickly 
view the JPEGs and put extra 
time into processing the Raw 
photos you want to keep.
 
✓ Bracketing: dSLRs are the kings of bracketing. Many have an auto brack-
eting feature, and all dSLRs should have a manual shooting mode, which 
opens up manual bracketing. Not all bracketing capabilities are equal, 
however, so carefully research the specific camera you have or plan to 
purchase.
 
✓ Reduced noise: Compared to compact digital cameras and super-zooms, 
dSLRs take photos that have much less noise, especially at higher ISOs. 
This is due to a variety of reasons. dSLRs have larger sensors, more 
powerful in-camera data processors, Raw photos with a greater bit-
depth, and tighter design and manufacturing tolerances for noise (espe-
cially as you ascend into the professional range).
 
dSLRs with sensors smaller than a 35mm film frame are called cropped bodies 
(FX if you’re a Nikon user). They perform better than cameras with smaller 
sensors but not as well as full-framed dSLRs (which cost a lot more).
Here are the tradeoffs to getting a dSLR for HDR photography:
 
✓ Wide range of different capabilities and formats: Just because the box 
touts the camera model as dSLR doesn’t mean that it will have the capa-
bilities you need. Even more expensive dSLRs are not guaranteed to be 
your cup of tea.
 
 It is easy to see that an $8,000 camera is a professional piece of equip-
ment. However, entry-level and amateur dSLRs (some costing upward of 
$2,000) can have very different capabilities.
Figure 2-6: Even an entry-level dSLR looks 
mighty impressive.

37
 Chapter 2: Gearing Up for HDR
 
✓ More complicated: You can’t deny the learning curve for operating a 
dSLR, especially if you’ve never used one. It’s a complicated piece of 
equipment that requires a dedicated artist-engineer to wring all the 
goodness out of it. Read the manual. Take your time. Practice. The 
payoff is greater.
 
✓ Cost: dSLRs cost plenty, as do lenses, memory cards, additional batter-
ies, remote shutter releases, bags, and the other gear that goes with the 
territory. This isn’t something most people can decide get into on the 
spur of the moment, go down to the local camera store, and come back 
fully equipped. It takes time.
 
 Thankfully, you don’t need ten lenses to shoot HDR. You can make do 
with a good kit lens to start with, especially if it has a decent wide-angle 
capability. (dSLRs are sold as camera bodies with no lens or as part of a 
kit, which usually features a popular and inexpensive zoom lens such as 
an 18-35mm, called a kit lens.) A wide angle lens is probably your next 
big investment.
 
✓ Hard to switch brands: After you commit to a particular brand of 
camera and compatible lenses, it’s hard to switch to another brand 
because you have to reinvest in all new lenses. It’s not impossible, mind 
you, but it does discourage experimenting with alternative systems.
 
✓ Bulk: dSLRs are good-sized cameras that take up space and can weigh 
you down. On the flip side, though, your wallet or purse will be lighter. 
(Think about it.)
Looking through Lenses
Although the camera body plays a significant role in determining whether the 
camera is suitable for HDR, lenses play an equally important role in steering 
you toward, or away from, your favorite subjects. In addition, lenses play a 
critical role in photo quality.
Budget compact camera lenses
Budget cameras have budget lenses. If you’re starting out with an inexpen-
sive compact digital camera, don’t expect the best image quality in the world.
 
The point that can’t be repeated enough, however, is that if you apply your-
self, you can shoot great HDR with inexpensive, entry-level gear.
Figure 2-7 shows the lens on the Panasonic Lumix LZ8 (the camera that shot 
the sunset in Figure 2-2). It’s t-i-n-y compared with other available lenses.

38
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
Figure 2-7: A budget lens and a better lens.
Some pros of shooting with a budget compact camera lens are that because 
the lenses are built right into the camera body, you don’t have to worry 
about changing them, carrying them, dropping them, or otherwise mess-
ing with them at all. You aren’t spending money after you buy the camera 
because the lenses are fixed. And oddly enough, having a fixed (noninter-
changable) lens can give you plenty of composition options, provided that 
the lens has decent wide-angle and zoom capabilities. Within compact digital 
subclasses and price ranges, lens specifications tend to be fairly similar. 
Expect focal lengths to begin in the range of 28 to 35mm (35mm equivalent). 
How much they zoom tends to vary with price. If you want to maximize your 
wide-angle capability (and you probably should for HDR), look for a camera 
with a 35mm equivalent focal length starting below 35mm.
Some of the cons of shooting with a budget compact camera lens are that 
budget lenses are small, probably not of the best quality, and might not even 
be made of glass. However, unless you’re planning to print billboard-sized 
prints, you can overcome this if you take good photos and are good with soft-
ware processing. You don’t have any flexibility because you’re stuck with the 
lenses you’ve got. If you aren’t happy with the field of view, you have to buy 
another camera.
Premium and super-zoom lenses
At this level, you’ve invested in a higher-quality camera and will reap the 
rewards of having better — and, in some cases, more specialized — lenses.
Some pros of using premium and super-zoom lenses for HDR are that like 
with budget compact digital cameras, the lens is conveniently, and perma-
nently, attached to your camera. You can’t forget it or lose it! As a group, 
premium and super-zoom lenses tend to feature wider angles when zoomed 
out and much more optical zoom when zoomed in than standard compacts. 
This increases the flexibility of the camera and what shots you can compose. 
Specific models may vary, however. Look for the range of zoom you like, but 

39
 Chapter 2: Gearing Up for HDR
realize you’ll probably use the wide-angle (under 35mm) capabilities of a 
super-zoom lens for HDR more than telephoto (over 85mm). As such, be care-
ful that the premium or super-zoom has the wide-angle view you need. And 
finally, manufacturers put better lenses in their premium products.
Some cons of using premium and super-zoom lenses for HDR are that 
because premium and super-zoom lenses can’t be changed, your flexibility 
is restricted compared with the variety of lenses available for a dSLR. Also, 
even though these lenses are higher quality, they can’t compare with the pre-
cision lenses of the upper-end dSLR market.
Wide angle lenses
 
Wide and ultra-wide angle lenses are the best lenses for HDR, hands down, 
especially if you want to shoot land-
scapes, cityscapes, small interiors, 
large interiors, and interesting 
close-ups (which is pretty much 
everything).
Figure 2-8 shows a shot in HDR 
of a local building, complete with 
dramatic sky, green trees, interest-
ing signs, and the tall building. A 
wide angle lens made it possible to 
be fairly close to the building (just 
across the street) and get the entire 
height and then some. This shot 
would be impossible without it.
Here are some pros of using wide 
angle lenses for HDR:
 
✓ Sweeping coverage: A wide 
or ultra-wide angle lens is the 
indisputable king of coverage. 
There is no substitute when 
you’re shooting an expansive 
landscape or a tall building. 
Many HDR photographers keep 
their wide angle lenses on their 
cameras most of the time.
 
✓ Interior spaces: To photograph small interiors, you need a wide angle 
lens. In Figure 2-9, you can see the difference between shooting an inte-
rior with a normal lens and a wide angle lens. In the photo on the left, 
taken with a Canon PowerShot A75 compact digital camera, you can only 
see a corner of the kitchen. Everything is cut off. In the photo on the 
Figure 2-8: Wide angle lenses are perfect for 
shooting tall buildings.

right, taken from the same location with a Sony Alpha 300 dSLR with a 
Sigma 10-20mm F4.5-5.6 ultra-wide angle lens, shows much more of the 
room. It’s the difference between absurd and practical.
Normal (35mm)
Wide angle (10mm)
Figure 2-9: Interior shot, normal versus wide angle.
 
 Larger interior spaces behave almost like landscapes or cityscapes. 
Wide angle lenses capture their magnificence, as shown in Figure 2-10.
 
✓ Close-ups: Wide angle lenses 
are surprisingly versatile. They 
enable you to get close to a 
subject and still see surround-
ing details. That makes for great 
HDR images.
Here are some cons of using wide 
angle lenses for HDR:
 
✓ Distortion: Wide angle lenses 
are prone to distortion levels 
above more traditional focal 
length lenses, especially as you 
get lower than 20mm. See what I 
mean in Figure 2-11.
 
✓ Composition challenges: Wide angle lenses offer compositional chal-
lenges above and beyond normal lenses. First, there’s more to see. That 
makes creating an uncluttered photo a real challenge. There’s so much 
junk everywhere! In addition, when you tilt the camera forward or back, 
vertical lines lean toward or away from you, respectively. This can make 
buildings look like they are falling toward or away from you. Check it out 
in Figure 2-12.
Figure 2-10: Wide angle lenses show off large 
interior spaces well.

 Chapter 2: Gearing Up for HDR
General purpose 
and kit lenses
General purpose and kit lenses are 
those lenses that typically come 
with a dSLR. You can also find plenty 
of upgrade options in this category, 
ranging from 16mm to 200mm, with 
17–70mm or so being a sweet spot. 
This is good enough to give you a 
wide-angle look and still be able to 
zoom in.
Figure 2-13 illustrates a shot in 
HDR from a Sony kit lens at 17mm. 
The final image is cropped slightly 
(another good reason to have a little 
extra field of view). This is definitely 
wide-angle territory, but the same 
lens can zoom in and focus more 
closely on the turtle’s face with no trouble.
Some pros of using general purpose and kit lenses for HDR are that gen-
eral purpose lenses are so popular because they offer you the flexibility of 
having a range of focal lengths to choose from at a moment’s notice. When 
shooting HDR, you can get a wide-angle shot and then zoom in closer with-
out having to change lenses or your vantage point. (Two other advantages 
35mm equivalence
Lenses are defined by their focal lengths, which 
is the distance between the optical center of the 
lens and its focal point (where it focuses the 
light passing through it), which should be on 
the same plane as the camera sensor (or film). 
For compact digitals and super-zooms, you are 
given the actual focal length of the lens and its 
35mm equivalent. The former is the actual mea-
surement. The latter is a helpful way to compare 
the angle of view you see in the photo between 
lenses and cameras with different size sen-
sors. It establishes a common frame of refer-
ence that you can understand. For example, the 
Canon G11 has a lens with a true focal length 
of 6.1-30.5mm. Compared to a full-frame 35mm 
camera, the 35mm equivalent focal length is 
28-140mm. It’s like adjusting for inflation.
Figure 2-11: This lens produces uncomfortable 
“What the?” distortion.

42
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
of using a general purpose zoom 
lens over separate lenses are that 
you get the equivalent coverage 
without the weight and bulk.) For 
example, one 16-85mm lens weighs 
less and is less bulky than the four 
lenses it takes to shoot the same 
basic focal lengths with these 
primes: 28mm, 35mm, 50mm, and 
85mm. That, and there’re there. You 
don’t need to make a decision on 
what lens to get, nor make an addi-
tional purchase. Someone’s already 
taken care of it for you!
Some cons of using general pur-
pose and kit lenses for HDR are that 
sometimes, the wide end of a general 
purpose lens cannot compete with 
a good, dedicated wide angle lens. 
Ultra-wide angle lenses can have 
focal lengths as wide as 10mm to 
12mm, topping out between 20mm or 
28mm. Many general purpose lenses 
start at around 17mm or 18mm. A 
few millimeters here and there might 
not seem like a big deal, but the 
practical effect on your photos is 
tremendous, as you can see in 
Figure 2-14.
Another con to general purpose and 
kit lenses is that you’ll likely read 
or hear some debate over quality. 
In a nutshell, cheaper, entry-level 
versions perform more poorly than 
more expensive lenses, but consider 
the range of quality when shopping. 
In general, a high-quality prime lens 
will often perform better than a kit 
or general purpose lens at the same 
focal length.
Other lens types
In addition to the lens types discussed in the previous sections, a few other 
types can be used in HDR photography:
Figure 2-12: The camera’s alignment causes 
this distortion.

17–70mm kit lens.

✓ Primes: Because they are fixed length lenses (no zoom capability), 
prime lenses do one thing, but they (should) do it very well. The most 
common types of primes are 35mm and 50mm.
 
 Despite what you might hear or think, you can use primes for HDR. Wide-
angle primes are great for wide-angle shots. Lenses like the 35mm or 
50mm get you in closer to the action. When I was shooting an exhibit 
commemorating the Battle of the Bulge, the large diorama was encased 
in Plexiglas, and the lighting was dismal. A wide angle lens wouldn’t 
have worked because the figures would look like tiny little ants, and the 
chances of getting extraneous things in the photo was larger. I was able 
to zoom in with my 50mm as if I were in the exhibit.
 
 There’s nothing stopping you from using a prime lens in any situation 
where that is the appropriate focal length. The upside is quality. The 
downside to using primes is the cost of investing in so many lenses, car-
rying them around, and needing to change them when you want to alter 
your field of view.
 
✓ Macro: Macro lenses are for super–close-ups. If you’re shooting bees, 
flies, or other creepy-crawlers, you will have a hard time shooting brack-
ets for HDR. However, you will find other subjects like flowers and small-
scale still life perfectly suited for HDR.
 
✓ Telephoto: Telephoto lenses are for long shots. These lenses reach out 
and capture a subject from far away. As a result, they compress the 
sense of depth and can make some very attractive scenic shots.
Choosing a Pod, Tri or Otherwise
A tripod is almost a necessity for shooting HDR. If you find yourself in the 
rare situation where you have a camera with a fast frame rate, a good AEB 
mode, lighting conditions that allow for a fast shutter speed, and steady 
hands, you can fire off blur-free bracketed shots without a tripod. The HDR 
software should be able to align them properly.
 
Having said that, it’s incredibly nice and often necessary to have a good 
tripod to keep the camera steady for your shots. Using a tripod increases the 
quality of your photos by a good measure.

44
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
Odd pods
You can support your camera in many different ways. You can buy large 
tripods, small ones, tripods with three legs and monopods with one leg. 
Needless to say, you can support your camera on other objects, wherever you 
are. These are basic photography techniques — leaning into a wall or door 
frame for support, resting the camera on a fence or other convenient object.
A lot of people use small, tabletop-size tripods for HDR. Shoot still life 
indoors or take it outside and shoot great low-angle shots with your camera 
near the ground. The Gorillapod, by Joby (www.joby.com), is a flexible 
tripod that can go anywhere and attach to virtually anything.
Compared to shooting with no support, monopods give you added stability. 
This can sometimes make the difference between a blurry shot and a clean 
one when shutter speeds need to be slow because of the available light. It’s 
like shooting hand-held HDR with a little help.
The downside to all of these techniques is that the camera is not supported 
as well as it would be with a good, stable tripod.
Inexpensive tripods
Any tripod basically does what you need it to do — hold the camera steady 
to prevent blur. You don’t have to spend a fortune, either. Having said that, 
you typically get what you pay for. Adorama Camera (www.adorama.com) 
and Amazon.com have an extensive selection of inexpensive tripods. Kodak 
(www.kodak.com) has several models under $30, and Joby (www.joby.com) 
features the Gorillapod, an innovative and inexpensive range of flexible tri-
pods (ranging from $20 to $100).
Some benefits to using inexpensive tripods are that they’re cheap. 
Inexpensive tripods tend to be light and easy to carry. Finally, they’re good 
for kids to use. (My kids use my el cheap-o tripods. If the tripod gets dinged 
up or breaks, it’s not a big deal.)
Some cons to using inexpensive tripods are that there are times, such as 
being outside on a windy day, when it’s hard to keep a cheaper tripod solidly 
planted and steady. (Many times, even inexpensive tripods are fairly stable.)
 
Sling a weight underneath the center if you can. This will help stability. I use 
a gallon water jug filled with either water or sand with one end of a cord tied 
through the handle and the other to a hook on the tripod. You can empty the 
water when you’re not using it.

45
 Chapter 2: Gearing Up for HDR
Other cons to using inexpensive tripods are that they have a nasty habit 
of coming unscrewed, bending, or breaking. Plastic leg release latches can 
be especially prone to breaking. Inexpensive tripods can’t get close to the 
ground, and the center column rarely comes out and away from the central 
axis of the tripod. This isn’t a disaster, but does limit the situations you can 
use it in. The head and legs of inexpensive tripods don’t come apart. This 
limits your growth and flexibility.
Expensive tripods
It really does come down to this: If you want a great tripod, you’re going to 
have to spend the money to get it. That isn’t to say all expensive tripods are 
great, but great tripods tend to be costly. Manfrotto’s 055XPROB tripod legs 
(the tripod I use, which is professional quality but certainly not top of the 
line) lists for about $180 at Adorama Camera (www.adorama.com).
Fun with inexpensive tripods
My kids and I sometimes have “Camera Wars.” In one variation, we mount our cameras on tripods 
and run around the house trying to take pictures of each other, as shown in the following figure. 
We don’t do this with my professional tripod, though. That gets put away in a cushioned bag in the 
closet.

46
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
Shopping tips:
 
✓ Components: Better tripods 
come in two parts: the legs and 
the head. Separating the compo-
nents allows you to choose dif-
ferent pieces that suit you best.
 
✓ Leg material: Wood is classic, 
but heavy. Aluminum is today’s 
standard but isn’t indestructible 
and can get cold during the 
winter. Carbon fiber and other 
composites are strong and light-
weight, although costly.
 
✓ Size: Tripod legs come in many 
dimensions. Make sure you get 
the size you need. Smaller sizes 
are ideal for backpacking and 
shooting on the run. For HDR, 
where size is often less of an 
issue, you will probably want a 
heavier tripod for stability.
 
✓ Pan heads: A traditional pan 
and tilt head, as shown in Figure 
2-15, is a great platform. It has 
large controls that lock or 
loosen to allow movement 
around three axes. These heads 
are nice to have if you plan on 
shooting panoramas.
 
✓ Ball heads: A ball head allows a 
great deal of freedom when you 
are composing the shot, espe-
cially if you have something like 
the Manfrotto horizontal grip 
(as shown in Figure 2-16), which 
sports a ball head with some-
thing that looks like a joystick 
attached to it. You can squeeze 
the grip to loosen the head and 
compose the shot with one 
hand. Sweet. I picked up this 
one from Amazon for about $130.
Figure 2-15: Pan and tilt heads are great for 
panning and tilting.
Figure 2-16: Ball heads with specialized grips 
make composition convenient.

47
 Chapter 2: Gearing Up for HDR
Additional items for your tripod
Say what? There are accessories for a tripod? Yup, and they can come in 
pretty darned handy, especially when shooting HDR. Check it out.
 
✓ Quick release plates: These plates, which attach to the bottom of your 
camera, allow you to quickly attach the camera to the tripod. They 
can help prevent slippage and vibration, too. I recommend attaching a 
quick release plate for each camera to improve trading cameras easily 
and quickly.
 
✓ Bag: Use a tripod storage bag (most are available from your tripod man-
ufacturer, but Tamrac, Case Logic, and other companies have their own 
lines) for easy carrying as well as protecting your tripod while on the go 
and when stored.
 
✓ Heads: Better tripods offer more than one head. For example, use a tradi-
tional ball head for quick composition, but use a pan head for panoramas.
Adding Optional Accessories to Your HDR Kit
The great thing about HDR is that you can go heavy or light, depending on 
your mood and the situation at hand. Use the following as a guide to get you 
started thinking about how you can expand your kit:
 
✓ Bags: Although you might need only a small pouch to protect a compact 
digital camera, you’ll want a decent bag for a dSLR and its lenses. You 
not only want your equipment with you (you never know when you need 
that one “thing”), but you want to protect your investment from dust, 
dings, and life.
 
 Always keep your bag(s) with you! If you set down your bag, walk across 
a field, and then decide to switch lenses, you have to trudge back to get 
the bag. And, of course, you don’t want someone walking away with your 
equipment. I prefer using sling bags (see one in Figure 2-17), loaded with 
a moderate amount of gear that’s not too weighty.
 
✓ A light meter: Although using an external light meter isn’t a prerequisite 
for shooting HDR (after all, your camera has a light meter built in), using 
an external meter can help you achieve the best possible exposure. (Plus, 
you look startlingly cool carrying one around.) In spot mode, you can 
point it at various parts of the scene to determine the actual dynamic 
range of the scene, which can help you decide on a bracketing strategy 
(more or less shots, as well as the exposure difference between them).

48
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
 
✓ Kneepads: HDR photography 
isn’t something you want to go 
out shooting in a ruffled pink 
dress and high heels. As attrac-
tive as you might look, consider 
dressing with a mind toward 
practicality.
 
 When you’re looking for those 
interesting angles, having knee-
pads can save your clothing and 
knees. I can’t count the number 
of times I’ve had to kneel down 
in gravel.
 
✓ A shutter release cable: Remote 
shutter releases are a wonderful 
accessory to have when shoot-
ing HDR. They keep your camera 
steady when shooting because 
you remove the possibility of 
jarring the camera by pressing 
the shutter button.
 
 When it comes to remote shut-
ter releases, one size does not 
fit all! Make sure to get one 
that’s compatible with your 
camera. Most are the traditional 
cord variety, but some are wire-
less. Needless to say, wireless 
remotes are very cool. You 
won’t trip over a long cord and 
you aren’t restricted by a short 
cord. The top camera manufacturers sell branded wireless releases 
for their systems ranging from about $80 to freakishly expensive. B&H 
Photo (www.bhphotovideo.com) has a good selection, followed by 
Adorama (www.adorama.com) and Amazon (www.amazon.com).
 
✓ Levels: When you shoot landscapes, cityscapes, or large interiors with 
a wide angle lens, problems with camera leveling and alignment can be 
accentuated. To protect yourself from your lying eyes (your eyes are 
often fooled by details of the scene, the ground you stand on, and any 
tilt to your head), use a small level that you can fit in your hot (acces-
sory) shoe, as shown in Figure 2-18.
 
 Time to ’fess up. The level shown in Figure 2-18 is sitting on top of this 
Sony hot shoe (rather than in it) because it isn’t compatible with this 
mount — something to look into if you get one. It fits fine on my Nikon, 
which I was using to take this photo.
Figure 2-17: Sling bags are easy to keep 
with you.

49
 Chapter 2: Gearing Up for HDR
 
 If your camera doesn’t have an accessory 
shoe, get a tripod that has a level built into 
the legs or head. Lacking that, you can buy a 
small level from the hardware store and duct 
tape that to your camera. (I’m only halfway 
joking with that one.)
 
✓ White balance aids: Whether you shoot 
HDR inside or out, using a gray card (as 
part of a white balance system) helps you 
correct color casts from different lighting 
and reflections. I use WhiBal from http://
rawworkflow.com. Find it online at www.
whibal.com for about $20 and up.
Figure 2-18: Use a level when 
shooting wide angle.
Other lenses: Contacts and glasses
You have to see clearly to take good photos. If 
you wear glasses or contacts, keep your pre-
scription up to date. Glasses can get in the way 
when you try to look through the optical view-
finder of your camera, but they are reliable and 
dependable. Wearing bifocals or progressives 
can help you alternatively focus through the 
viewfinder and see the controls and settings on 
the camera. If your camera has a built-in diopter 
adjustment control (this includes most dSLRs), 
use it to adjust the focus of the viewfinder so 
you don’t need to rely on glasses or contacts. 
If you need more corrective power, see if your 
dSLR has stronger add-on diopter adjustment 
viewfinder lenses.

Looking Hard at HDR Software
In This Chapter
▶ Putting the software puzzle together
▶ Starting with Raw editors
▶ Reviewing HDR applications
▶ Considering other applications
Y
ou can’t pursue HDR photography without the right software. The key is 
to define what that software is, what it does, and understand how it fits 
in with everything else. All you really need is an HDR application to generate 
and tone map an HDR image. However, you might also want to use an appli-
cation that either helps you create the best image possible or manage the 
process.
To help you sort out all the software, this chapter describes 
the different roles that Raw converters, HDR applications, 
image editors, and image management applications play 
in the process. I also describe some of the major play-
ers for each type of software, what they offer, and 
some good and bad points about each title.
In this chapter, you discover what applications you 
need for HDR photography and get a head start on 
tailoring your software kit to match you and your 
desires.
Software: Don’t Pass HDR without It
Table 3-1 shows a general roadmap of the types of software 
that either assist or create HDR as well as how they fit together. 
The phases correspond to the main HDR workflow (see Chapter 10 for more 
details). Within each phase, I show you more than one type of application 
that can perform similar tasks.

The most important software element of HDR photography is, not surpris-
ingly, the HDR application. This is what you use to turn your bracketed 
photos (and single Raw exposures for pseudo-HDR) into high dynamic range 
images, and tone map to create super-saturated, attention-grabbing images, 
as shown in Figure 3-1.
Figure 3-1: From beginning to end — brackets (left) and final image (far right).
 
Spend some time trying out several of the applications listed in the later sec-
tion, “Surveying the HDR Software Landscape,” to decide which one you like 
best. Choose the one that best fits your artistic sensibility, workflow, and 
budget. Look for the following list of features and options to help guide you 
in your trial and purchase:
 
✓ Input file types: Make sure that the HDR application accepts the file 
types you want to work with — Raw, JPEG, or 8- or 16-bit TIFF.
 
✓ Output file types: The HDR application should save a final tone mapped 
file in the format of your choice. Common types are JPEG and 8-bit and 
16-bit TIFFs.
 
✓ Processes Raw photos: Some HDR applications have limited Raw sup-
port for newer or less popular cameras.

53
 Chapter 3: Looking Hard at HDR Software
 
✓ Settings management: Being able to save and load tone mapping set-
tings makes duplicating your work far easier. You can create baseline 
settings for artistic styles, subjects and genres, or conditions, and work 
from your saved settings rather than having to re-create the same steps 
each time.
 
✓ Edits HDR images: Some applications perform rudimentary HDR image 
editing, such as cropping, rotating, and reducing noise. Applications 
with more options give you greater flexibility over where in the process 
you decide to perform these tasks.
 
✓ Generates HDR images and tone maps HDR images: Generating an HDR 
image and tone mapping are defining characteristics of an HDR applica-
tion. (See Figure 3-2.) Some HDR applications also have tone mapping 
plug-ins that work in Photoshop.
 
✓ Other functionality: Some HDR software doubles as an image editor 
(most notably, Photoshop).

Rah rah for raw raw
(Also known as: If I hear one more Raw joke, I’m going to rawr.) Raw conver-
sion is only an issue if you shoot Raw photos. Although you can generally 
plop the Raw photo directly into an HDR application, image quality is better if 
you convert Raw images first with a dedicated Raw editor or converter.
For more information on converting Raw photos to TIFFs for HDR, see 
Chapter 7.

54
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
MBA in image management
HDR photography benefits greatly from image management applications such 
as Adobe Lightroom and Apple Aperture. You’ll take tons of photos when 
you’re bracketing. These applications help you keep track of the photos, 
metadata (for exposure), date, time, and subject.
Editing for zing
 
One of the biggest misperceptions about HDR is that the image comes 
straight out of the HDR application looking perfect. Most of the time, you’ll 
also want to use an image editing program to edit the tone mapped image 
before posting it online or printing. Post-HDR processing includes using an 
image editor to covert images to black and white, create panoramas (whose 
individual frames are shown in Figure 3-3), retouch (sharpen, reduce noise, 
fix lens distortion, correct color problems, and so on), enhance (improve 
contrast, saturation, and so on), crop, and/or resize for online viewing.
Figure 3-3: Tone mapped panorama frames ready to be stitched together.
Your Guide to Raw
If you shoot in Raw, you should convert your Raw images to TIFF before gen-
erating and tone mapping HDR. Although this is an optional step, it gives you 
a boost in image quality. You can read more about this process in Chapters 7 
and 8, but you can start thinking about your software options now.
Using your camera’s software
Camera manufacturers receive mixed reviews on their Raw conversion and 
image editing software. Some people love what they see, and some people 
hate it.
Table 3-2 lists several camera Raw software packages by manufacturer, all 
of which have Windows and Macintosh versions. They are all free except 
for Nikon’s Digital Capture NX 2 (shown in Figure 3-4), which has a free trial 
available for download.

Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
 
Creating HDR images is a different beast than traditional photo editing. Don’t 
write off a potentially great Raw application just because it’s not as popular 
as the rest. Consider this information when looking at Raw applications:
 
✓ Insider information: It might surprise you to know that Raw photos are 
proprietary. Canon puts special Canon stuff in its files. Nikon, Sony, and 
the rest do the same. Adobe is resisting this and advocating an open 
Digital Negative standard. Until such time as they all agree, no one is 
going to know a Raw file format better than the manufacturer.
 
✓ Decent controls: At a minimum, you should look for the ability to 
control exposure (for creating brackets from a single Raw photo). 
That’s about it, really. If you want to do some editing, restrain yourself. 
Remember, you aren’t trying to get the perfect exposure. The brackets 
and HDR processing will take care of that.
 
✓ Adequate Save As options: If you need to convert Raw files to some-
thing that will load into an HDR application, you must have the ability to 
save the resulting image as an 8- or 16-bit TIFF or JPEG. For higher qual-
ity, choose 16-bit TIFF.
 
✓ Bearable interface: The software that comes free with your camera 
might have a clunky or ugly interface. What counts is that you can navi-
gate your way around without too much confusion or fuss.
Third-party Raw software
You can buy or download a plethora of third-party Raw editors and convert-
ers. If you’re unhappy with your current software and want to try something 
new, get your hands on one or more of the applications listed in Table 3-3.
Stylin’ with presets
Style presets are another reason to look care-
fully at the software that comes with your 
camera. Presets allow you to shoot Raw and 
use predefined settings researched and chosen 
by the manufacturer as a starting (or ending) 
point for conversion from Raw to JPEG or TIFF. 
Many times, the software presets are the exact 
same options that you can set in-camera.
You might want to set the camera to save Raw 
only, and then load the presets in software as 
you convert only those photos you want to keep. 
This frees up processor workload in the camera 
and storage space on your memory card, not to 
mention hard drive space. The other advantage 
to using style presets, of course, is being able to 
try them out before you commit them to JPEG.

Adobe Camera Raw
Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) is a plug-in that works within Adobe Photoshop 
and Photoshop Elements. It is Adobe’s near-universal Raw editor and con-
verter. ACR is very popular and has a clean and professional interface, as 
shown in Figure 3-5. The icons at the top are tools and the three tabs below 
the histogram are the main editing categories. There’s not much to complain 
about with ACR.
 
ACR works differently within Adobe Photoshop Elements than in Photoshop. 
The Elements version has fewer options, bells, whistles, and doodads. That 
won’t affect you as much when it comes to preparing Raw images for HDR 
because, for the most part, you’re after a fairly direct conversion to TIFF.

Surveying the HDR Software Landscape
The following applications (presented alphabetically) specialize in HDR. In 
the following sections, I provide a Web address for each application (so you 
can investigate and download the software or trial version), a description of 
the software and its strengths and weaknesses, and a screen shot of some 
of them in action.
Artizen HDR
 
 Artizen HDR (www.supportingcomputers.net) is one of the stronger 
HDR applications available. It has a nice interface that’s reminiscent of a 
full-featured graphics editor. With Artizen HDR, after you generate and tone 
map the HDR image, you can edit and finalize your image.
The nifty features of Artizen HDR are its full-featured tone mapping, batch 
processing, and image editing capabilities. The iffy features are that it has an 
annoying nag screen in the trial version, and it’s a Windows-only product.

 Chapter 3: Looking Hard at HDR Software
Dynamic Photo HDR
 
 Generating HDR in Dynamic Photo HDR (www.mediachance.com) is pretty 
fun. It has some powerful options that are very nice. Aside from all the obvi-
ous stuff, you can paint a ghosting mask (a fancy term for painting over 
objects that are moving, and thereby creating ghosting problems — more 
information on ghosting can be found in Chapter 7) onto the HDR preview to 
immobilize moving objects, as shown in Figure 3-6.
Figure 3-6: Resolving ghosting by painting a mask in Dynamic Photo HDR.
Dynamic Photo HDR is a good dog in that it has advanced options for HDR 
generation, a great ghosting routine, powerful manual alignment tools, help-
ful tone mapping presets, batch processing, and is available for both Mac and 
Windows.
easyHDR
 
 There are two versions of easyHDR (www.easyhdr.com): Basic and Pro. The 
basic version is very, well, basic. You load your images and start tone map-
ping. You can’t save HDR files, but you can open existing .hdr files and tone 
map them. Upgrading to easyHDR Pro gives you a lot more power. You can 

60
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
generate HDR images, align them automatically or manually, and choose from 
many other options. You can manually alter EV information for each image, 
perform image size reduction as you create the HDR, choose from different 
HDR radiance maps (True HDR, Smart Merge, Image Stacking), change 
response curve, and choose from different anti-blooming and -noise settings.
The yummy things about easyHDR are that the program has a standard set of 
HDR features and you can create projects. The yucky things are that it gives 
questionable tone mapping results at times, the basic (free) version is very 
limited, and it’s a Windows-only product.
FDRTools
 
 FDRTools (www.fdrtools.com) 
comes in two flavors — Basic and 
Advanced — in addition to a tone 
mapping–only Photoshop plug-in. 
The thing that strikes me when firing 
up FDRTools is that it’s a complex 
piece of software written for serious 
users — not that it doesn’t look 
friendly, but the casual user might 
be intimidated at first. Figure 3-7 
illustrates the FDRTools interface in 
HDRI Creation mode. Individual 
brackets are on the left, and there 
are windows open that serve various 
purposes.
FDRTools works with a project 
paradigm. When you create and add 
images to a project, you can choose 
to save the HDR file or not. If you 
save it, you have to open it as a sepa-
rate image or new project. A side 
effect of this is that each time you 
open a project with multiple photos, 
FDRTools must re-create the HDR 
file, slowing things down dramati-
cally. The advantage is having all 
the images and settings stored in a 
convenient project file that is the 
only thing you have to work with.
The best things about FDRTools are that it has advanced HDR tools, it cre-
ates a single program file, and it’s available for both Mac and Windows. The 
worst thing is that it has lots of technical options, which means a steeper 
learning curve to effectively use all the features.

Advanced.

Hydra HDR plug-in for Aperture 2.1
The Hydra HDR plug-in for Aperture 2.1 (www.creaceed.com) is exactly 
what it says — an HDR plug-in that works from within Apple Aperture to 
create and tone map HDR images. Figure 3-8 illustrates the Hydra plug-in 
interface with brackets on the left and the main preview in the center.
Figure 3-8: Tone mapping in Hydra.
The great things about this plug-in are that it has a really nice interface, is 
easy to use, it integrates seamlessly with an Aperture workflow, and Raw pro-
cessing options are integrated into the plug-in. The not-so-great things about 
it are that you have limited tone mapping options compared to other applica-
tions, and it’s available for the Mac only.
Photomatix Pro
 
 Photomatix Pro, from HDRsoft (www.hdrsoft.com), is a leading application 
in the HDR market. It has everything you need to create outstanding HDR and 
a few things you don’t need but might find useful.
There are two tone mapping modes. The Details Enhancer is the traditional 
tool used by a number of HDR photographers. It has a plethora of settings 
and controls in one floating window and a tone mapping preview in the main 
window. Photomatix Pro also has a Tone Compressor (another tone mapping 
paradigm) and Exposure Fusion (formerly known as Exposure Blending).

62
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
The pros of Photomatix Pro are that it produces great images and has 
full-featured HDR and tone mapping options, single- and multiple-batch 
processing options, and several methods with a profusion of controls. To 
boot, Photomatix is friendly, not too complicated, and available for Mac and 
Windows (and also with plug-ins for Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Aperture). 
The cons are that the interface is sometimes clunky, there is no manual align-
ment option, and it has limited HDR and post-HDR editing although it will let 
you rotate and crop your images.
Qtpfsgui
 
 Creating HDR images in Qtpfsgui (http://qtpfsgui.sourceforge.net) 
is pretty straightforward and similar to many other applications. It boils 
down to creating a new HDR image by selecting bracketed source photos and 
aligning them. The odd name (quitpeefizgooey is probably a close pronuncia-
tion), comes from the program and libraries used to build it (you can see 
exactly which ones on its Web site).
The green light for Qtpfsgui is that it has lots of options, and you can use 
manual alignment. The red light for it is that sometimes there are too many 
options that aren’t well explained, and it feels like a scientific application 
due to the terminology and opaque option names. In addition, if your system 
needs QT4 installed to run Qtpfsgui, it’s 131MB!
Integrating More Cool Software 
into Your HDR Workflow
Who doesn’t want to use all the software they possibly can? The applica-
tions described in the following sections assist HDR on the front or back 
end. Some, like Photoshop, can handle every task. Others, like Photoshop 
Elements, are only useful in the editing and finishing phase.
Staying current with HDR applications
I can’t list every HDR application that’s out 
there, of course. Some are pretty expensive, or 
have yet to gain any traction, so I chose not to 
cover them in this book.
HDR software is an evolving field, so keep 
checking into software and plug-ins. Developers 
all over the world are working feverishly to 
attend to your HDR needs and bring you the 
right mix of features at the right cost.

 Chapter 3: Looking Hard at HDR Software
Corel Paint Shop Pro Photo
 
 Paint Shop Pro (www.corel.com) is a full-featured raster and vector graph-
ics editor, complete with a bevy of photo editing tools and features, including 
a limited HDR capability. For the price, you can hardly go wrong with this 
package. You might prefer to create and tone map your HDR images in an 
HDR-specific application and then finish it in Paint Shop Pro.
Paint Shop Pro is like Batman in that you get a lot of bang for the buck with 
it because it can generate and tone map HDR as well as edit images. It’s like 
the Joker in that it has limited HDR and tone mapping features, has some 
memory issues, and can be buggy at times.
Adobe Photoshop
 
 Photoshop (www.adobe.com) is the leader in the graphics and intensive photo 
editing market, and for good reason. There’s not much it can’t do, and what it 
does do it does very well. Although other packages handle the routine elements 
of photo editing just as well (brightness, contrast, and so on), Photoshop has 
many other powerful features that complement your work and workflow.
Photoshop is worth buying because it’s very powerful, it’s the industry-
standard image editing application, it integrates well with other Adobe prod-
ucts, it can generate and tone map HDR on its own, and it’s compatible with 
both Mac and Windows. The downside with Photoshop is that it’s expensive 
and it can be unwieldy and takes time to master.
Adobe Photoshop Elements
 
 Photoshop Elements (www.adobe.com) is Adobe’s slimmed-down version of 
Photoshop. It is aimed squarely at the consumer image and photo editing 
market. It’s light, fun, easy, and pretty cool. Most of the basics are here, but 
there are some omissions when it comes to serious work.
The affirmative parts about Photoshop Elements are that it’s easy to use, 
inexpensive, has handy image management features, and still can do most 
of what you want it to. The negative parts of Photoshop Elements are that it 
doesn’t have a Curves tool, masks (which affect blending), no Duotone mode 
(which affects your ability to tone images), and no Lab Color mode.
Adobe Lightroom
 
 Lightroom (www.adobe.com), as shown in Figure 3-9, is an image manage-
ment and editing application that is available for Macintosh and Windows 
platforms. Notice the Develop tab at the top-right of the interface. This is 
where you will work to change settings to convert Raw photos. Lightroom is 
to photographers what Photoshop is to graphic artists.

64
Part I: The ABCs of HDR Photography 
Figure 3-9: Managing photos in Lightroom.
Lightroom is a great application that helps you manage your photo collec-
tion and perform routine (and not so routine) photo editing without having to 
leave the program. You should get consistently good results from Lightroom, 
no matter what camera you have or your other workflow needs. It also has 
integrated Raw image processing capabilities, great image management soft-
ware (which allows you to manage, rate, develop, and publish images), and 
works on Macs and Windows. The downside is that you might not care for the 
Raw editor, and you might not want to bother with its image management.
 
HDRsoft (the makers of Photomatix Pro) has an export plug-in that works 
within Lightroom. Select the images you want to process and then export 
them to Photomatix Pro. You can even reimport them at no extra cost.
Apple Aperture
 
 Aperture (www.apple.com) is Apple’s answer to Adobe’s (Lightroom) appli-
cation. As shown in Figure 3-10, Aperture is an image management and editing 
application that offers essentially the same functionality as Adobe Lightroom, 
especially when it comes to HDR photography and Raw photo processing.

65
 Chapter 3: Looking Hard at HDR Software
Figure 3-10: Apple Aperture is a strong contender.
The “comfort food” aspects of Apple Aperture are that it’s fun to use, has 
great compatibility with Mac OS, has nice Raw editing capability complete 
with access to EXIF data, and can export images to HDR applications. The 
“fast food” aspects are that it’s Mac only, and you might not care for its Raw 
image editor.
 
There is a handy Photomatix Pro export plug-in for Aperture that helps 
you get your game on faster. You can export photos and tone map them in 
Photomatix Pro without ever leaving Aperture. Select the image or brack-
ets you want to process, choose Images➪Edit With➪Photomatix HDR Tone 
Mapping, and you’re in business.

HDR Photography

In this part . . .
T
his part is about choosing the best scenes for 
HDR and then taking the pictures. HDR photo-
graphy uses a special technique — bracketing — to 
take more than one photo of a scene. You have to 
set your camera up and operate it a bit differently 
than normal.
In Chapter 4, you ﬁ nd out how to surgically attach 
your camera and become a cyborg photographer. 
Really. Chapter 5 is one of the most important 
chapters in the book. You discover different tech-
niques to shoot HDR brackets using different cam-
eras. Finally, because it’s not always possible to 
set up a tripod to shoot brackets, Chapter 6 gives 
you the lowdown on when to break the rules and 
shoot the best single raw photos for HDR.

H
DR photography is more than just “point and shoot.” It involves under-
standing exposure and using your camera to set up and capture a 
wide dynamic range of light through brackets. If you are familiar with these 
concepts, HDR isn’t overwhelmingly different. If you are new to photography, 
HDR will help you learn a great deal.
Different cameras have different features, strengths, and limi-
tations. HDR is flexible enough to roll with the punches. 
It is possible to shoot HDR with cameras ranging from 
cheap budget compact digital cameras all the way up 
to the most expensive dSLRs. You can shoot single 
Raw exposures more casually and still have fun with 
pseudo-HDR, but the big payoff of pursuing HDR 
comes when you start to tackle the brackets.
How you do all this depends on your camera. In 
this chapter, I show you how to get your camera set 
up and ready to shoot HDR based on whether it has 
exposure compensation, a manual shooting mode, or 
full-up auto bracketing.
If you have trouble understanding some of what’s going on 
here, remember to consult your camera’s manual. There are also 
some pretty good For Dummies books out there that cover digital photogra-
phy in general, dSLRs in general, and some camera models in particular.

Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
The Secrets (Shh . . .) of Exposure
Because HDR involves getting around the limitations of dynamic range in 
modern digital photography, it stands to reason that exposure is a critical 
concept to understand. When you’re setting up your camera to shoot brack-
eted photos, you need to be comfortable thinking and acting quickly.
 
Exposure is how much light enters the camera for the length of time the shut-
ter is open. An exposure is shorthand for a photograph, or frame (which is a 
throwback to a frame of film).
You control exposure by changing how the camera operates. There are three 
primary ways to do this, as shown in Table 4-1. Each variable has the same 
effect — raising or lowering the exposure. They all do it differently, as well as 
having a different major side effect.
Table 4-1 
Controlling Exposure
Variable
How It Works
Side Effect?!
Aperture
Changes the size of the opening in the 
lens that lets light in the camera
Shortens or deepens 
the depth of field
Shutter 
Speed
Changes the length of time the shutter 
(the thing that keeps light out) is open
Stops or blurs motion
ISO
Changes the digital camera sensor’s 
sensitivity to light
Raises or lowers noise
Here are some of the more important concepts related to exposure and how 
to control it for HDR:
 
✓ Aperture: Aperture is the size of the opening in the lens, measured in 
f-numbers. The f-number (also called an f-stop) is inversely proportional 
to the size of the opening (the aperture).
 
 In other words, a larger aperture has a smaller f-number and a smaller 
aperture has a larger f-number. The size of the lens and the actual size 
of the opening are irrelevant in comparing exposure. You can see this 
relationship play out in Figure 4-1, where each succeeding f-stop is half 
as large as the previous (but the numbers get larger).
 
 A larger aperture creates a shallow depth of field, which is the area you 
perceive to be in acceptable focus. A smaller aperture increases the depth 
of field. This is illustrated in Figure 4-2, where the wide aperture of f/1.4 
has a much smaller depth of field than the second shot, taken at f/16.

71
 Chapter 4: Becoming One with Your Camera
f/1.4
f/2.8
f/5.6
f/11
Figure 4-1: The lens aperture lets light into the camera.
 
 For HDR, it is best to keep aper-
ture constant between brackets 
so the depth of field does not 
change.
 
✓ Shutter speed: Shutter speed 
is the length of time the shut-
ter stays open and allows light 
to enter the camera and strike 
the sensor. You control this 
value to let less or more light in, 
which in turn darkens or bright-
ens the photo.
 
 For HDR, fast shutter speeds 
are less important than tradi-
tional hand-held photography 
because you will often be taking 
photos of inanimate objects 
with the camera mounted on 
a tripod. For hand-held auto 
bracketed HDR, a faster shutter 
speed is more important.
 
✓ ISO: For digital cameras, ISO 
equates to sensor gain (the sen-
sitivity to light). The higher 
the ISO, the greater the camera’s 
ability to capture scenes with 
less light. The counterweight to 
this is always noise, as shown in Figure 4-3. Notice in particular the noise 
is much more apparent in areas of even tone — the green concourse 
floor and white cinderblock wall.
 
 For HDR photography, the lowest possible ISO is the best setting. Raise 
it only if you cannot get the shot any other way.

different apertures.

Figure 4-3: High ISO settings dramatically increase noise.
Photographic stops/EV
Akin to how f-stops work (as I mention in the preceding bullet list), a photo-
graphic stop is a principle that allows you to compare changes in exposure. 
One stop doubles or halves the amount of light for a given photo, depending 
on whether you increase or reduce exposure.
This behavior applies to all the methods of controlling exposure, which 
means you can describe aperture, shutter speed, and ISOs in terms of stops.
 
✓ Stopping down means you are reducing exposure.
 
✓ Stopping up means you are increasing it.
Camera controls can change stops incrementally, which means you can 
change the shutter speed by a third of a stop.
Here’s where Exposure Value (EV) 
comes into play: One EV is the equiv-
alent of a stop of exposure. EV often 
refers to the location of the current 
exposure on the camera’s exposure 
index or exposure display. It can also 
refer to the relative distance from 
one exposure to this mark or another 
exposure, expressed in EV.
Figure 4-4 shows the LCD monitor 
of my Sony dSLR, which has an 
exposure index handily visible at 
all times. It is marked off from -2 to 
+2 EV, with ticks every third of an 
EV (which is normally one shutter speed or aperture increment one way or 
another).
Figure 4-4: The exposure index in action.

73
 Chapter 4: Becoming One with Your Camera
This is your guide to measure the effects of altering your camera’s settings 
on exposure in manual mode. In this case, the combination of 1/5 second 
shutter speed, f/8 aperture, and ISO 100 result in an anticipated overexposure 
of +2.0 EV.
 
EV 0.0 is assumed to be the ideal exposure given the lighting conditions at 
hand. Only you can tell whether it is aesthetically the correct exposure or not.
If a camera in manual mode meters a scene and tells you the current expo-
sure is +1.0 EV, you know the photo will be overexposed by a stop. You 
should either increase (make faster) the shutter speed or make the aperture 
smaller to bring the exposure down to 0.0 EV. Similarly, a bracketed photo 
taken at EV -2.0 is intentionally underexposed by two stops.
 
When setting auto exposure bracketing distance, you set the relative EV that 
each exposure differs from the ones around it. Common settings are +/-0.3, 
+/-0.7, +/-1.0, and +/-2.0. While the lower settings are not as effective for HDR, 
+/-1.0 and +/-2.0 are right in the ballpark.
 
✓ Underexposed: A photo is underexposed if it is too dark. In HDR, you 
shoot underexposed photos on purpose to tone down highlights in a 
scene, which will retain their details.
 
✓ Overexposed: An overexposed photo is too bright. In HDR, you shoot 
overexposed photos on purpose to reveal details in shadows.
Bracketing
Bracketing is taking two or more photos with different exposures of the same 
scene at the same time. Back in the day when film was king, bracketing was 
a way to cover more exposure possibilities (like placing more bets on differ-
ent numbers at a roulette wheel — you stand a greater chance of winning). 
Without digital exposures and auto review, you could only be sure you got 
the best exposure when the film was developed. With HDR, bracketing is not 
about being uncertain of the correct exposure, but rather, increasing the 
amount of exposure data you’ve gathered.
Bracketing most often assumes that the central exposure is at 0.0 EV but this 
does not have to be the case.
 
The word bracket can be used as a verb, as in, “I told my assistant to bracket 
the scene.” It can also refer to a single photo in the bracketed set.
A bracketed set is a group of bracketed photos that all go together, as seen in 
Figure 4-5. This is a 5-shot bracketed set, taken at +/- 1.0 EV. You’ll often see 
people indicate the exposure settings of a bracketed set as -2/-1/0/+1/+2 EV.
See how it all fits together?

74
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
Figure 4-5: A 5-exposure bracketed set at -2/-1/0/+1/+2 EV.
Metering
Your camera has the ability to mea-
sure the amount of light in a scene 
and calculate the proper exposure. 
Most of the time, the camera meters 
the scene when you press the shut-
ter release button halfway down. In 
this way, you can take a reading and 
then alter the controls to change the 
exposure.
There are several different metering 
modes. Your camera might have 
one of several types such as multi-
metering, center-weighted, spot, 
partial, or average. Figure 4-6 shows 
two shots of a garage. The lighting 
is somewhat complicated. Spot 
mode — centered on the dark 
garage — raises the exposure so 
the interior can be seen but at the 
expense of everything else. Matrix 
mode leaves the garage too dark 
while everything else looks pretty 
good.
 
HDR is generally compatible with 
multi-metering, which evaluates all the light sources in a scene. You may 
need to switch modes, however, to take into account very bright or dark 
areas.
Figure 4-6: Different metering methods often 
produce different photos.

75
 Chapter 4: Becoming One with Your Camera
Configuring Your Camera for HDR
One of the most important elements of shooting HDR photography is config-
uring your camera. You change the settings to optimize the outcome for HDR 
rather than a traditional digital photograph.
Different types of cameras have different capabilities. Each of the following 
sections generalizes your situation by what your camera can do. Find the 
method you can use (experimentation notwithstanding) based on the follow-
ing criteria:
 
✓ Exposure Compensation Bracketing: Only cameras without a manual 
mode or auto exposure bracketing (AEB) need to use exposure compen-
sation. This includes most compact digital cameras. Newer models don’t 
often allow you to directly alter the exposure. This makes traditional 
bracketing impossible.
 
 This is a sneaky workaround for that limitation. You can use exposure 
compensation to indirectly change shutter speed and therefore manu-
ally bracket a scene.
 
 Figure 4-7 shows exposure 
compensation in action on a 
budget compact camera. The 
camera is in Programmed Auto 
mode — there is no manual 
mode and the camera does not 
have AEB — and the exposure is 
adjusted to -2.0 EV (that’s why 
it is so dark) in preparation to 
shoot the lower bracket.
 
✓ Manual Bracketing: Any camera 
with a manual mode can manu-
ally bracket a scene. Exposure 
compensation bracketing is 
very similar but uses the expo-
sure compensation control instead of directly changing shutter speed.
 
 If your camera limits the exposure difference between auto brackets to 
less than +/- 1.0 EV, you will find manual bracketing, although a pain, to 
be more practical.
 
✓ Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB): AEB is found on many dSLRs and the 
occasional compact camera or super-zoom. You don’t need a manual 
mode for AEB to work on most cameras.
 
✓ Single-Shot HDR: Any camera that shoots Raw photos can perform 
single-shot HDR.
Figure 4-7: Using exposure compensation to 
shoot HDR.

76
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
 
The following sections take you up to the point just before you make the ini-
tial exposure adjustments and start taking the photos. Bracketing and shoot-
ing single exposures are covered in Chapters 5 and 6.
Setting Up Exposure Compensation
Exposure compensation bracketing is a fantastic workaround. It enables you 
to take a camera without manual controls or auto bracketing and manually 
bracket a scene. Bypass limitations and proceed directly to HDR!
This section shows you how to get started and is optimized for cameras that 
don’t have manual shooting mode or AEB. I am using a Canon PowerShot 
A480 to illustrate. Follow these steps to get your camera set up to shoot 
brackets using exposure compensation:
 
1. Turn on the camera.
 
 Make sure you are in shooting and not playback mode.
 
 Always check to make sure that you have enough battery power to last 
for your shooting session. You can change batteries between brack-
eted sets, but it will ruin your composition. Also confirm that you have 
enough memory card space to store the photos. If not, delete photos, 
swap cards, or download existing photos and then reformat the card.
 
2. Mount your camera on a tripod.
 
 For compact digital cameras, this is a necessity. The things you have 
going against you are a slow frame rate and manual bracketing. Neither 
of these allow for hand-held bracketing.
 
 Depending on your personal preference, you can get all the settings 
dialed into the camera while you hold it, and then mount it on the 
tripod.
 
3. Based on the specific capabilities of your camera, select an appropri-
ate shooting mode.
 
 Some cameras disable exposure compensation depending on the mode 
you are in. Consult your documentation to confirm which modes make 
exposure compensation available.
 
 Choose a mode that suits the scene you are shooting:
 
• Auto: Good all-around mode.
 
• Programmed Auto: If your camera disables exposure compensa-
tion in auto mode (Canons do this), try programmed auto, often 
abbreviated as P, and seen in Figure 4-8. Notice that for this 
camera, all shooting modes are accessed through the back screen 
by pressing the Mode button.

 Chapter 4: Becoming One with Your Camera
 
• Scene: Different cameras 
have different scenes 
to choose from, such 
as Baby, Party, Sports, 
Landscape, Portrait, and 
so forth. The various 
modes seem to be multi-
plying, although they are 
fairly consistent within 
brands. Each mode will 
change the camera’s set-
tings and optimize them 
for the given conditions.
 
 Pay particular attention 
to your camera’s manual 
and identify the right scene 
that you are shooting. Focus, in particular, can be thrown off if the 
scene is set to something close (like Food) and you are outside and 
need focus set to infinity.
 
4. Choose picture quality, size, and other photo settings.
 
 Choose the largest, best photo quality you can. This will result in the 
best HDR image down the road. In addition, you often have creative con-
trol over how the camera processes data from the sensor and converts 
it into a JPEG file format. You may have color or style options that pro-
duce a more vivid photo.
 
5. If possible, turn off the flash.
 
 You don’t want the flash to fire, thinking it is making up for a bad expo-
sure. You want the dark exposure to be dark.
 
6. If possible, set ISO to the 
lowest possible value, as in 
Figure 4-9.
 
 This helps fight the noise battle. 
If raising ISO increases the noise 
on a $2,500 camera, you can 
imagine what it’s going to do 
on a $150 budget compact.
 
7. Turn off dynamic range 
optimization.
 
 The point of HDR is to use 
bracketed photos to capture 
increased dynamic range. You 
want each photograph to be a 
Figure 4-8: The P and Program are pretty big 
giveaways that you are in Program mode.
Figure 4-9: How low can you go? How low can 
you go?

78
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
true representation of the scene whether it is really bright or dark. DR 
optimizers, which often affect JPEGs and leave Raw photos alone, defeat 
this purpose.
 
 Having said that, the difference isn’t that great. You won’t be stopped by 
the police if you’ve left your DR optimizer on (as I have many times).
 
8. If necessary (and possible), set focus to infinity and turn face detec-
tion off.
 
 Some compact digital cameras have two or three auto focus modes, 
such as normal, macro, and infinity. At the very least, make sure you 
are not in macro mode unless you are shooting something very close. 
Infinity works very well, assuming you are a reasonable distance away 
from the subject. Check to make sure what your minimum focus dis-
tance is or you won’t be able to focus on a close subject.
 
9. If desired, turn on LCD guide lines.
 
 These little lines form a grid on 
the LCD and help you align and 
compose the shot. I use them all 
the time. (See Figure 4-10.)
 
10. If desired, turn photo 
review off.
 
 When you manually bracket by 
altering the exposure control, 
you will be working hard to get 
the pictures fired off quickly 
for most scenes. You lose time 
when the camera decides to 
review each shot for 2 seconds.
 
 If you need to, shoot a test shot 
and review it for the proper focus. Then get back in and shoot the entire 
thing without review.
At this point, your camera is set up and ready to shoot brackets. The rest of 
the story is explained in Chapter 5.
Preparing to Manually Bracket a Scene
Some cameras do not have AEB. Others have it but it’s stinky. For example, 
the Sony Alpha 300 is a great entry-level dSLR that has auto bracketing. The 
problem is, the exposure difference between brackets is limited to +/- 0.3 or 
+/- 0.7 EV. That’s too little for HDR given the fact that this camera limits you 
Figure 4-10: Grid lines help you align your 
subjects.

79
 Chapter 4: Becoming One with Your Camera
to 3 shots. You want a wider range of light than this camera offers. Despite 
this, the Sony excels at manual bracketing.
Follow these steps (I’m using the Sony Alpha 300 to illustrate) to set up your 
camera to manually bracket a scene:
 
1. Turn on your camera.
 
 Make sure you are in shooting and not playback mode.
 
 Always check to make sure that you have enough battery power to last. 
You can change batteries in between bracketed sets, but it will ruin your 
composition to have to do this between brackets. Also confirm that 
you have enough memory card space to store the photos. If not, delete 
photos, swap cards, or download existing photos and then reformat 
the card.
 
2. Mount your camera on a tripod.
 
 Manual bracketing requires you to use a tripod even if you are shooting 
Raw exposures because it takes time to change the settings between 
brackets. Hand-held bracketing requires a fast frame rate (fps) and AEB 
pdq for the fyi of the omg of the HDR.
 
3. Attach any additional gear.
 
 If you use a remote shutter release or level, attach them to the camera 
now. Try not to trip over the remote shutter release cable or bonk your 
head on the level.
 
4. Enter manual shooting mode, as in Figure 4-11.
 
 Manual mode is a must for manual bracketing unless you are using 
exposure compensation. If that’s the case, you’re in the wrong section.
 
 Notice that this camera (a Sony Alpha 300) 
has a nice big burly mode knob on top — 
not all do. Even though this is a dSLR, it still 
has an auto mode as well as scenes. These 
are irrelevant for manual bracketing, 
however.
 
5. Choose a file format, picture quality, and 
other photo settings.
 
 This determines what file format you’ll be 
using in software, whether JPEG or Raw. 
Raw photos, of course, can be edited when 
converting. Pay special attention to JPEG options, as they are much less 
forgiving. Once you take a JPEG, that’s pretty much it.
 
6. Turn off the flash.
Figure 4-11: Set phasers on stun 
and mode to manual.

80
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
 
7. Set ISO to minimum.
 
 Strive to shoot at ISO 100. This results in the lowest noise per photo, 
which can add up over three or more brackets. If you have to raise it, do 
so no more than necessary.
 
8. Set the drive/release mode for a single shot.
 
 Since you’re shooting manual brackets, you don’t want to accidentally 
fire off five shots. There’s no real harm in that, but it will make sorting 
through the photos on your computer harder.
 
9. Turn noise reduction off.
 
 You don’t want noise reduction slowing you down. Do what you can 
(low ISO) to reduce noise beforehand. Remove the rest in software.
 
10. Turn off anti-shake or vibration reduction features, as in Figure 4-12.
 
 These features can cause alignment prob-
lems and aren’t necessary when you mount 
your camera on a tripod.
 
11. Confirm metering mode.
 
 Although matrix-type metering (the default 
on most cameras) should be sufficient in 
most cases, you may need to experiment 
with other modes if you aren’t getting the 
brackets you want.
 
 If in doubt, look to see if the center bracket (0.0 EV) is a good photo. If it 
is, the metering is probably fine, even if it is not scientifically calibrated 
and fully verified by the Department of Weights, Measures, and Meters. 
If the central subject is too bright or in too much shadow, consider 
changing to spot or center-weighted mode.
 
 Bracketing will more than likely take care of this, but you should be look-
ing to get the best possible center exposure. It will pay dividends that 
will become more obvious later in the book.
 
12. Choose a focus mode.
 
 Most of the time, auto focusing is preferred. If the camera has trouble 
getting a focus lock, however, you may have to tell Scotty down in 
Engineering to back off while you kick in the manual override.
From here, you’re ready to compose the shot and start taking pictures.

shakey is now off. Feel free to

 Chapter 4: Becoming One with Your Camera
Dialing in Auto Bracketing
Auto exposure bracketing (AEB) is a fantastic time-saver. You don’t have to 
fiddle with exposure controls in the middle of the shot. All you have to do is 
make sure your camera is configured correctly, set up the initial shot, and 
then press the button.
 
Most dSLRs have auto bracketing, although you will find that each manu-
facturer implements it somewhat differently. Currently, Canon limits you to 
three shots but allows you to alter the AEB amount up to +/- 2.0 EV in 1/3 EV 
increments. Nikon, on the other hand, limits you to a maximum exposure 
increment of +/- 1.0 EV but allows you to take up to 9 shots in many cameras.
I use a Nikon D200 to illustrate the steps to set up auto exposure bracketing:
 
0. For some cameras, pre-configure underlying AEB settings.
 
 That’s right — this step takes place before the first step. It’s like going 
to 11, only in reverse.
 
 Depending on your camera, pre-configure AEB before you leave home. 
You don’t want to be looking at a sunset that is quickly fading while 
you are hunting through your camera’s menu system double-checking a 
bunch of complicated AEB settings.
 
 For Nikons, this can take a few minutes but once it’s done you can leave 
it alone. Regardless of the brand, check your documentation and read 
through the AEB section until you fully understand what’s going on. 
Look for settings such as these in your menus (using the Nikon D200 as 
an example, default settings indicated by (d)):
 
• Auto Bracketing Set: This setting (see Figure 4-13, which shows 
the D200 bracketing menu) controls what the camera changes to 
create the brackets. It can 
be exposure, flash level 
(this type of bracketing 
changes flash intensity 
to alter exposure), white 
balance, or a combination. 
Options are AE & Flash 
(d), AE Only, Flash Only, 
and WB Bracketing.
 
• Auto Bracketing in M 
Exposure Mode: This set-
ting defines how bracket-
ing is accomplished when 
AE & Flash or AE Only 
modes are selected and 
Figure 4-13: Navigating through AEB options.

82
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
the camera is in manual mode. Options are Flash/Speed (d), 
Flash/Speed/Aperture, Flash/Aperture, and Flash Only.
 
• Auto Bracketing Order: This one is fairly simple. The option sets 
the order the brackets are taken, in relation to what it metered 
(MTR). Options are MTR>Under>Over (d) and Under>MTR>Over.
 
• Auto Bracketing Selection Method: Defines how to turn bracket-
ing on or off. Options are Manual Value Select (d) and Preset Value 
Select.
 
 Not all cameras require this much setup. With many Canon and Sony 
cameras, for example, you just turn it on! The point here is to show 
you that it can be complicated and scare you into reading your manual. 
Without further reader intimidation, let’s continue.
 
1. Turn on your camera.
 
 Make sure you are in shooting and not playback mode. Always check to 
make sure that you have enough battery power to last. You can change 
batteries in between bracketed sets, but it will ruin your composition. 
Also confirm that you have enough memory card space to store the 
photos. If not, delete photos, swap cards, or download existing photos 
and then reformat the card.
 
2. If desired, mount your camera on a tripod.
 
 If you have a fast enough frame rate and AEB, you can get by with shoot-
ing hand-held brackets. The caveat is your shutter speed has to be fast 
enough to avoid blurring.
 
 For example, taking exterior shots in good light allows a fast shut-
ter speed, even at an aperture like f/8. Inside is another story. It’s not 
unheard of for the bright end of a bracketed set to take a few seconds 
inside. If you can’t get shutter speed fast enough to avoid blurring, grab 
the tripod.
 
3. If you’re using a tripod, attach any additional gear.
 
 If you are shooting hand-held AEB, you won’t need a remote shutter 
release or level. Otherwise, attach them to the camera now.
 
4. Choose a shooting mode.
 
 Depending on you and your camera, you may want to be in fully manual 
mode, but you can also decide on something a little more automatic.
 
 Double-check with your camera’s manual to make sure your shooting 
mode and AEB are simpatico.
 
 Here are some advantages of using specific modes with AEB:
 
• Programmed Auto (aka Program AE, Programmed AE, and so 
on): Programmed modes are fully automatic. Enter the mode and 
that’s that. The camera will set the optimum exposure and use AEB 
(if available in this mode) to capture the brackets. The downside 

83
 Chapter 4: Becoming One with Your Camera
to this is that you don’t directly control shutter speed or aperture, 
which takes the creative control out of your hands.
 
 You may have the option of using a Flexible Program, also called 
Program Shift. In this case, select aperture and shutter speed from 
a preset list of combinations.
 
• Manual: You have the most control in manual mode, which is often 
good. It minimizes the chance some sort of auto ISO gizmo will 
kick in or your flash will decide to flash when you least expect it. 
Manual means you’re in charge.
 
• Aperture Priority: This is a very popular mode for HDR because 
it lets you set the depth of field for creative and focus purposes 
and lets the camera figure out the right shutter speed to make it 
happen.
 
• Shutter Priority: This mode is less beneficial in bracketing because 
anything moving fast enough to demand a high shutter speed is 
moving too fast to bracket. On the other hand, if you are going sans 
tripod, dial in a fast shutter speed to minimize or eliminate blurring 
caused by your own movement.
 
• Scene: Great for beginners. Select a scene like Landscape and 
you’re off to the HDRaces.
 
 Remember, all of these modes except manual only work for HDR when 
you use auto bracketing. Otherwise, the exposure is set and you will not 
be able to change it except by using the Exposure Control.
 
5. Confirm file format, picture quality, and other photo settings.
 
6. Enable auto exposure bracketing.
 
 You have to turn AEB on. For some cameras (such as Sony cameras), it 
may be accessed through the Drive button. Some cameras may have a 
button (Bracket or Fn), while others require you to access and enable 
bracketing from the menu system.
 
7. If possible, select the number of brackets, as in Figure 4-14.
 
 Many cameras default to 3 exposures and 3 exposures only (read that with 
a Sean Connery accent à la The Hunt for Red October). If you can choose 
more, your bracketed set will have a greater overall dynamic range.
 
 From a practical perspective, 3 is fine, although you may miss some range 
if the scene you shoot has a tremendous contrast between lights and 
darks. Increase the number of brackets to 5 if your maximum bracket-
ing range is only +/-1.0 EV. You can go to 7 or 9 exposures (Nikon users, 
mainly) if you are concerned that you won’t capture enough range.
 
8. Choose a bracketing range/increment.
 
 A good choice for 3 brackets is +/- 2.0 EV. This gives you a total range 
from the underexposed to the overexposed photo of 4.0 EV. You may be 
limited to +/- 0.3 or 0.7 EV. If this is the case, consider going to manual 

84
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
bracketing or take more than 
one AEB set starting at different 
points.
 
 Use +/- 1.0 EV if you have no 
choice. You’ll get good overall 
dynamic range if you shoot 5 or 
more brackets.
 
9. Set Release (Drive) mode.
 
 For AEB, set the release mode 
to high speed, continuous, or 
high speed continuous to take 
the bracketed shots with one 
press of the shutter release 
button and in the shortest 
amount of time.
 
10. Turn off the flash if not needed.
 
11. Set ISO to minimum to control 
noise.
 
12. Turn noise reduction off to ensure a good frame rate.
 
13. Turn off anti-shake or vibration reduction.
 
 This is if you want to be really nerdy about things. I’ve made just about 
every mistake possible while shooting HDR, including forgetting to turn 
off anti-shake or vibration reduction. It’s not going to matter that much. 
But, if you want to go all-out, camera manuals tell you to turn vibration 
reduction/anti-shake features off if you use a tripod.
 
14. Choose a metering mode for the best center exposure (the one at 0.0 EV).
 
15. Choose a focus mode that works best for the given situation.
That’s it. You’re ready to compose the shot and start shooting.
Getting Ready for Single-Shot HDR
The great thing about shooting single-shot HDR is you don’t have to do any-
thing special.
 
The biggest problem you will face is forgetting to change the settings around 
if you decide to switch back and forth between different types of photogra-
phy with the same camera.
Figure 4-14: Five brackets selected with a range 
of +/-1.0 EV between each shot.

85
 Chapter 4: Becoming One with Your Camera
Here is a handy checklist of things to look for when switching from HDR back 
to normal photography:
 
✓ Turn off AEB: You may have to set the number of brackets to 0. I’ve 
taken many a bracketed set when I thought I was just shooting normal 
photos.
 
✓ Zero previously set exposure compensation: I hate it when I forget 
to do this and afterward take a terribly blown out picture because the 
compensation was set to +2.0 EV. In fact, it’s even worse when I forget to 
reset the camera and give it to one of my kids to take photos with. Figure 
4-15 shows the result. My son Ben took this well-composed photo of his 
brother Sam mowing the yard at +2.0 EV.
Figure 4-15: That’s one sunny day — +2.0 EV sunnier, in fact.
 
✓ Turn on anti-shake/vibration reduction measures: You will probably be 
shooting hand held, which means these features are very helpful.
 
✓ Turn on noise reduction features: This is not as critical because these 
kick in only for high ISO or long exposures. Still, it’s nice to have. If you 
prefer to handle noise in software, always leave this off.
 
✓ Turn on auto-ISO features: This moves the camera back toward auto.
 
 The theme here, and with many of these settings, is to help you get the 
right exposure. You won’t be shooting brackets, so it’s even more impor-
tant to nail the exposure.

86
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
 
✓ Set proper shooting mode: You may have a favorite mode you like to 
keep the camera in while not shooting brackets.
 
✓ Set desired metering mode: Another safeguard to get the right exposure 
for the conditions you are in and the subject you are shooting.
 
✓ Return to desired focus mode: This is a personal preference.
 
✓ Enable auto flash, if necessary: It can be a surprise when you try to take 
that perfect photo, need the flash, and have it off.
 
✓ Return to preferred release/drive mode: Mainly for consistency. You 
don’t want surprises.
Other helpful hints
Here are some more hints that don’t neatly fit 
elsewhere. It’s nothing huge, but they are help-
ful, hints, and most definitely other.
 ✓ Reset the camera: One problem with 
shooting HDR is that it generally requires 
the camera to be in a completely differ-
ent mode, than, say, shooting portraits. 
You have the ISO set to its minimum, may 
have bracketing enabled, and have pos-
sibly turned off auto focus. When you pick 
up the camera to take photos of your kids 
and change everything, make sure to reset 
it. Some cameras (the Nikon D200 to name 
one), have shooting banks that allow you 
to save different camera configurations 
for different purposes. You might set up an 
HDR, Interior Portraits, Outside Portraits, 
and Macro bank.
 ✓ Cleaning: Before going out on an impor-
tant shoot, clean your camera and lenses. 
Clean the camera sensor (dSLRs only) 
only if you must. There’s no sense trying to 
clean it when there is no visible dust. You 
risk adding more dust with no discernable 
upside.
 ✓ Starting with a clean card: Assuming you 
have downloaded the photos, wipe your 
memory card every time you start a new 
shoot. Reformat it from the camera menu 
system so your image numbering system 
stays intact.
 
 Warning: Make sure you’ve downloaded 
the photos first!
 ✓ Batteries: It isn’t fun to run out of batteries 
while on scene shooting HDR, especially 
if you are out in the hinterlands, shoot-
ing impressive landscapes. Buy more. 
Recharge them and keep them in your bag. 
Look at your battery meter (if you have one) 
before getting started.

racketing, the technical heart of HDR, is the photographic process you use 
to shoot differently exposed photos of the same scene. Each photo con-
tains a segment or slice of the total dynamic range that was present. Together, 
they capture something close to what you see with your eyes.
It sounds simple enough. Shoot a few photos of a scene and 
then have the software put it all together as an HDR image 
that you tone map. When you get ready to take the 
photos, however, several questions come to mind.
 
✓ How many brackets do you need? Two, three, 
four, or more?
 
✓ What exposure value (EV) distance should you 
use: +/–1.0 EV or +/–2.0 EV? More? Less?
 
✓ How do you shoot brackets on different cam-
eras with different capabilities?
 
✓ How do you shoot multiple sets of auto exposure 
bracketing (AEB) of a single scene?
 
✓ Can you use an external light meter?
The answers to these questions — the subjects of this chapter — provide a 
firm foundation for you to shoot digital HDR photography with many different 
types of cameras in all sorts of situations.

88
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
Big Answers for Big Bracketing Questions
The two fundamental questions that dominate most discussions of HDR are
 
✓ How many brackets do you need to shoot?
 
✓ What is the best format: JPEG or Raw?
The answers to these questions are both aesthetic and technical in nature:
 
✓ Aesthetic: The differences are largely perceptual. It depends on what 
you like and the level of quality you can live with.
 
✓ Technical: A scene’s dynamic range affects how many brackets should 
be used to fully capture it, and the capabilities of your camera play an 
important role. Because of these issues, the number of brackets you 
want to shoot can change from one set to the next.
 
If your camera shoots JPEG and not Raw photos, you obviously have no 
choice but to shoot your brackets with JPEG.
Deciding how many brackets to shoot
Knowing how many brackets to shoot is clearly an important factor in HDR. 
It provides the much-needed information of where to start manual bracketing 
and how to configure (if possible) AEB on your camera.
Finding the right answer to this question depends on several things. The 
dynamic range of the scene, the capabilities and limitations of your gear and 
your personal style all play a role.
 
✓ The dynamic range of the scene: Three exposures shot at –2/0/+2 EV 
can handle most scenes. Scenes with the sun, white clouds, bright reflec-
tions off water, metal, or buildings, might require more underexposed 
brackets, and scenes with very dark areas (either in shadow or because 
of the light) need more overexposed brackets.
 
 A very high dynamic range is shown in Figure 5-1. In this case, the sun 
presents a very strong light source, and the dark shadows along the 
tree line are at the opposite end of the spectrum. Such a scenario calls 
for more brackets if you can shoot them. If you can’t (or don’t want to) 
shoot more, you’ll clip (exposure data goes off the scale in either direc-
tion, getting cut off and lost) lows or highs.

Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
 
✓ Your gear: Your gear limits the number of brackets you can take in 
many ways:
 
• If using exposure compensation, you’re limited to an EV range of 
+/–2.0 EV. This effectively limits the number of brackets you can 
reasonably take.
 
• If using AEB, you’re stuck with how many brackets you can pro-
gram the camera to take. Often, this is only three. Some cameras 
can shoot more. Alternatively, you can take multiple bracketed 
sets (centered on different center exposures) or revert to manual 
brackets.
 
• If using manual mode, you’re limited by shutter speed and aper-
ture. If the scene is very bright, you might not be able to shoot fast 
enough (say, 1/4000 second or faster) at f/8. You might have to 
stop-down (decrease the aperture by increasing the f-number).
 
 For example, the dark exposure in Figure 5-1 (taken with a Nikon 
D200) was shot with a shutter speed of 1/2500 second, well beyond 
what most compact digital cameras can take at f/8. Comparatively, 
the Panasonic Lumix LZ8 maxes out at f/8 and 1/2000 second in 
manual mode. Because its aperture can’t get any smaller and the 
shutter speed can’t get any faster, that photo is beyond the capa-
bilities of the LZ8.
 
✓ Your style: Some photographers don’t deviate from three brackets 
at –2/0/+2 EV. It’s their style. Some like five brackets at +/–1.0 EV or 
some other combination. That’s the great thing about artistic freedom: 
It’s free.
Table 5-1 summarizes the rationale for choosing a specific number of 
brackets.

It is sometimes necessary 
to depart from symmetric 
brackets to account for a 
particularly dark or bright 
area.
You end up with exposures 
looking something like 
–4/–2/0/+2 EV.
5
Less noise; more details.
Similar to 3 exposures at 
+/–2.0 EV, only 5 exposures 
are normally shot at +/–1.0 
EV with AEB. Manually, you 
would get a large dynamic 
range shooting +/–2.0 EV.

Incredible dynamic range 
(to the point of overkill for 
many scenes) if shooting 
at +/–2.0 EV. Most shoot 7

Best with a pro-caliber 
dSLR. Much more dif-
ficult if you are shooting 
manually (forget about 
moving objects like clouds). 
Impossible with exposure 
compensation.

You’re shooting the surface 
of the sun from the dark side 
of the moon or you’re trying 
to impress your date.
Send me a postcard. I’ve 
always been interested in the 
dark side of the moon, espe-
cially as it relates to 
Pink Floyd.
 
As you get more experience, your own bracketing pattern and preferences 
emerge. You might settle on using three exposures, for example, separated 
by +/–2.0 EV. That serves as your baseline, which you can modify or extend 
based on the conditions at the scene.
Seeing the difference
Reading about why you can or should shoot more or fewer brackets is one 
thing. Seeing the difference among different numbers of brackets of the same 
scene — and comparing them in Raw versus JPEG format — is even more 
illuminating.
Upcoming figures present a close crop of the same scene, processed using 
different numbers of brackets in different formats. A differently cropped 
version of the brackets of the full image is shown earlier in Figure 5-1, and

the final, processed shot (nine exposures from TIFFs) is shown here. For 
the upcoming examples, I zoomed in on the sun and tree line to show both 
extremes of the spectrum of light and dark in this scene.
 
The same settings were used to generate and tone map the HDR images. 
The tone mapping settings in Photomatix Pro 3.2 are fairly plain. Strength is 
100, Color Saturation is 80, Smoothing is in Slider mode at 0.0, Microcontrast 
is +5, White Point is 2.231%, and the Black Point is 0.559%. All other values 
are at their defaults. The final results have not been spruced up in any way. 
This is how it looks straight out of Photomatix Pro. For information on what 
these settings mean and how to use them in Photomatix Pro, jump over to 
Chapter 8.
Figure 5-2 illustrates an HDR image tone mapped from JPEG brackets. Pay 
special attention to the sun, the rays of light, clouds, the tops of the trees, 
and the shadows in the trees.
Table 5-2 summarizes what can be gleaned from looking at the different 
swatches in Figure 5-2. Just so you know, posterizing (not to be confused with 
pasteurizing) looks like a badly compressed JPEG or an old-fashioned GIF 
stuck with 256 of the wrong colors. You expect to see a smooth color gradi-
ent but instead get distinct bands or areas of blech.

Overall, JPEGs perform well. If you look at the overall image versus this mag-

overdo it. Shooting more brackets at a smaller EV distance lowers noise and 
gives you a smoother gradation between colors.

each set of images in terms of the number of brackets and their EV differ-

Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
Even at the lowest level, 16-bit TIFFs (from Raw) perform better than JPEGs 
because there is more dynamic range inherent in a 16-bit TIFF than in an 8-bit 
JPEG. Is the difference earth-shattering? Not really, but if you’re going for the 
highest-quality image that can be printed out at a larger size to sell (giclée 
prints, which are fine art prints of the highest quality), TIFFs do make a defi-
nite difference. (See Chapter 11 for more about creating TIFFs for print and 
archiving.)
The quality improvement in TIFFs mirrors that seen in JPEGs. The more 
brackets you shoot, the greater the dynamic range you capture. Shooting 
with a smaller EV difference (+/–1.0 EV) results in less noise, and a combina-
tion of more brackets with small EV differences results in smoother color. 
The difference between five exposures shot at +/–1.0 EV rather than +/–2.0 EV 
shows this trade-off very well.
 
The bottom line is to shoot as many brackets in Raw as practical with a small 
EV difference if you want the highest quality. Three brackets at +/–2.0 and 
five brackets at +/–1.0 EV are good for most situations. Use JPEGs if you want 
a good image but aren’t concerned about getting the most quality possible.
Shooting Bracketed Photos
Shooting brackets is where it’s at. This is where you feel the most like an HDR 
photographer because it’s different than shooting single exposures. Make sure 
your camera is set up according to the type of brackets you can (or want to) 
shoot (see Chapter 4) and follow the steps in the appropriate section.
 
Read through all the sections, regardless of which method you gravitate to so 
that you can gain important perspectives on how to shoot HDR. This comes 
in handy, no matter what the situation.
The steps outlined in the upcoming sections on exposure compensation and 
manual bracketing are predicated on a few things:
 
✓ Three — the number of the brackets, that 
is: The steps are based on taking three 
brackets, as shown in Figure 5-4. This 
illustration shows three brackets set up 
in relation to the EV index: one at –2.0 EV, 
another at 0.0 EV, and the third at +2.0 EV.
 
 If you wish to shoot more or fewer brackets, change your approach 
accordingly. For example, five brackets at +/–1.0 EV require that you set 
exposure compensation to –2.0, –1.0, 0.0, +1.0, and +2.0 for the respec-
tive brackets.
Figure 5-4: Three brackets 
separated by +/–2.0 EV.

97
 Chapter 5: Bracketing Exposures for HDR
 
✓ The order of the brackets shall be under, even, over: You can, of 
course, shoot them in any order you like, but for the sake of clarity, the 
examples follow this format.
 
✓ Exposure jumping: Sometimes the exposure jumps around between 
brackets. After you start shooting, ignore any changes and be consistent 
with the bracket distance. If necessary (you think the exposure is really 
hopping), start over when the conditions are more stable.
 
One more thing: All examples were shot at ISO 100 and an aperture of f/8 
unless otherwise noted. You can vary these settings at your own discretion, 
of course.
Using exposure compensation
Exposure compensation is a fallback method to shoot brackets. If you don’t 
have a camera that has a manual shooting mode or AEB (which includes 
almost anyone without a dSLR or advanced compact/super-zoom), there 
is no other option. The main advantage is you can use a camera otherwise 
unsuited to HDR without immediately having to go buy something expensive.
Another major benefit is that it steps you away from the inner workings of 
your camera and exposure control. You don’t have to mess with shutter 
speed or most other settings. Just call up exposure compensation and set it 
to shoot the appropriate brackets — the camera handles the rest (it changes 
shutter speeds for you). Follow these steps to shoot brackets using the expo-
sure compensation method:
 
1. Set up your camera.
 
 See Chapter 4 for the lowdown on this important step.
 
2. Compose the scene.
 
3. Double-check camera settings.
 
 Make sure that you’re in the right shooting mode and that the flash 
is off.
 
 Check your camera’s manual to see what modes exposure compensa-
tion is compatible with. Depending on the camera, you can control 
exposure compensation and disable flash while in many scene modes, 
programmed auto, and possibly auto mode. For example, the Canon 
PowerShot A480 allows you to force the flash off in auto mode, but it 
doesn’t let you access exposure compensation. You must be in program 
or scene mode for that.
 
 If you’re shooting a scene with clouds, you should turn off review (when 
the camera shows you the photo you just took for a few seconds) so you 
can get right back to shooting. Look under your system configuration or 
playback menu and turn off review or auto review.

98
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
 
4. Meter the scene.
 
 Press the shutter release button halfway down. You might see exposure 
or focus information appear, telling you the camera has “got it.”
 
 If flashing red lights appear and the camera can’t focus, you might not 
be able to continue given the current conditions. This can happen in 
low-light conditions when focusing on a neutral gray object, such as 
clouds at dusk. You might need to switch to manual focusing if you 
have it.
 
5. Set exposure compensation to –2.0 EV.
 
 
 This normally requires you to press a button (the universal symbol for 
exposure compensation is shown in the margin) to bring up the expo-
sure compensation index on the back of your camera, and then press 
another button to lower the number to –2.0 EV.
 
6. Shoot the underexposed bracket.
 
 This one is dark, as shown in Figure 5-5. Notice that the tree to the left 
and the foreground are completely dark. The sunset looks nice. One 
down, two to go.
Figure 5-5: The underexposed photo appears dark; 
this is good.

99
 Chapter 5: Bracketing Exposures for HDR
 
 If you turned off review, you can continue right into the next step. 
Otherwise, you might have to wait until the camera comes back 
into shooting mode to continue. You can speed it up sometimes by 
nudging the shutter release button (but not enough to take another 
photo).
 
7. Set exposure compensation to 0.0 EV.
 
 This brings the exposure back to normal, as seen in Figure 5-6. You 
always want one good photo at 0.0 EV.
 
8. Take the center bracket.
 
 Figure 5-6 shows the exposure at 0.0 EV. This is basically a standard 
snapshot. Notice, however, that the dynamic range of this scene is too 
large to capture. The foreground is a bit too dark.
Figure 5-6: The center bracket is a good average exposure.
 
9. Set exposure compensation to +2.0 EV.
 
 This raises the exposure (as shown on the meter in Figure 5-7) to create 
an overexposed photo.

100
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
 
10. Take the overexposed bracket.
 
 The final bracket is shown in Figure 5-7. The highlights are blown out, 
but what was previously in shadow is now well lit. That’s it!
Figure 5-7: The final bracket captures the details in shadows.
The mechanics of shooting brackets using exposure compensation are pretty 
simple. You’re not working directly with shutter speeds or anything more 
complicated than moving the EV index from –2.0 to 0.0 to +2.0.
Manual bracketing
Manual bracketing is very similar to shooting using exposure compensation, 
only you’re directly manipulating shutter speed and watching its effect on 
EV. And, like exposure compensation, one of the main reasons to use manual 
bracketing is if your camera doesn’t have AEB, or if it’s not suitable for HDR.
For example, I shot HDR manually for quite some time with a Sony Alpha 300 
dSLR. It has AEB, but the maximum exposure difference between brackets 
is only +/– 0.7 EV. This results in a total range between the lower and upper 
brackets of 1.4 EV — far less that I wanted for most situations.

101
 Chapter 5: Bracketing Exposures for HDR
 
Whether you have a camera that shoots AEB or not, learning to shoot manual 
brackets is very helpful. After a bit of practice, HDR photography (brackets, 
exposure, and the other aspects or terminology) becomes imprinted on your 
brain. You’ll also get better working with your camera this way.
Follow these steps to shoot manual brackets:
 
1. Set up your camera.
 
 You can read how in Chapter 4.
 
2. Compose the scene.
 
3. Double-check camera settings.
 
 You want to be in manual or aperture priority mode with the right 
f-number dialed in, the ISO as low as you can go, flash off (mostly), focus 
mode set to your preference, anti-shake turned off, noise reduction off, 
review off, drive mode set to your preference, and metering mode set.
 
4. Meter the shot.
 
 Press the shutter release button halfway down to get a meter reading. 
The camera shows you where your current settings put the exposure.
 
 Make sure you get a good focus as well, if using auto focus. This is trig-
gered by metering. If you’re manually focusing, now is a good time to 
double-check it.
 
5. Set the shutter speed so that the EV meter reads –2.0 EV.
 
 For the first exposure, you’re moving from wherever the camera hap-
pened to be set up to where you need it to go. That can sometimes be a 
long way.
 
 When you shoot in manual mode, you’re paying attention to two things 
at once: the shutter speed and EV index.
Bracketing in the beginning
It might interest you to know that bracketing 
sprang into being well before HDR and digital 
photography. Bracketing was originally used 
to give photographers different exposures to 
choose from — hoping one would nail it. Of 
course, this was in the days of film, when you 
couldn’t call up a preview of the photo you 
just took on the camera’s LCD screen to know 
whether it was off and you needed to reshoot. 
Believe it or not, bracketing was such a viable 
technique that even some film cameras have 
auto bracketing features.

102
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
 
 For most cameras, three “clicks” of shutter speed equal 1.0 EV. 
Therefore, if the camera says that you’re at +1.0 EV, shorten the shutter 
speed (remember that faster shutter speeds result in less exposure) by 
nine increments.
 
 Putting that in terms of shutter speeds, Figure 5-8 illustrates what you 
need to do. If you shoot at 1/30 (1.0 EV), you’ll go past 1/40, 1/50, 1/60 
(0.0 EV), 1/80, 1/100, 1/125 (–1.0 EV), 1/160, 1/200, and come to rest on 
1/250 (–2.0 EV), which is –3.0 EV from where you were (which is relevant 
only to show you how far you had to go to get here), but –2.0 EV is on 
the exposure index (which is where you want to be). The final EV index 
is also illustrated.
Initial meter and movement
Set, with shutter speed
Figure 5-8: Move the exposure from the first reading to -2.0 EV 
to set your first bracket.
 
 For the underexposed photo, double-check the shutter speed to make 
sure it’s fast enough for the scene at hand. If you’re shooting fast-moving 
clouds, for example, a slow shutter speed can smear them. If needed, 
increase your aperture or ISO.
 
6. Shoot the underexposed bracket.
 
 If you’re trying to 
move swiftly, here 
is where you reap 
the dividends of 
turning off review. 
Otherwise, you 
have to wait or 
speed up the 
camera to get back 
to shooting because 
the camera wants to 
show you the photo 
you just took.
 
 Figure 5-9 shows 
an underexposed 
photo of a barn near 
sunset. The sky and 
clouds show up 
very nicely at –2.0 EV and f/8, and none of the highlights are blown.

bracket.

 Chapter 5: Bracketing Exposures for HDR
 
7. Set shutter speed 
so the EV meter 
reads 0.0 EV.
 
 You’re reduc-
ing the shutter 
speed, as shown 
by the meter in 
Figure 5-10. This 
raises the expo-
sure because the 
camera lets more 
light in to strike 
the sensor.
 
8. Take the center 
bracket.
 
 It’s especially 
helpful to have 
the center bracket 
perfectly exposed, 
as shown in Figure 
5-10. This way, you 
have a good photo 
regardless of 
whether the HDR 
processing looks 
good or not. In 
addition, you can 
use this center 
bracket as a blend-
ing layer in soft-
ware to heighten 
the sense of real-
ism. In this case, 
the tree branches 
to the left are 
moving, which 
causes a problem 
in the final HDR 
image. That is 
overcome by using 
the branches from 
this photo.
 
9. Set the shutter 
speed so the EV 
meter reads +2.0 EV.

Figure 5-11: Highlights are blown out; this is okay for this 
bracket.

104
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
 
10. Take the overexposed bracket.
 
 The final sequence of this bracketed set is shown in Figure 5-11. 
Notice that the sky is almost completely washed out, but details in 
the grass, barn, and trees to the right are brought out. This is what 
bracketing does.
With time, you should be able to knock out a three-to-five exposure bracket 
fairly quickly, assuming the shutter speeds are reasonably fast. This means 
you can overcome some cloud movement, but not all.
Auto bracketing
Auto bracketing is the bee’s knees. It takes a tremendous amount of work-
load off you and transfers it to your camera. (Make sure to tip your camera 
afterward by giving it a healthy battery recharge.) Not only that (yes, there 
are advantages beyond catering to your life of leisure), you shoot faster. A 
camera with a normal frame rate can shoot faster brackets than even the 
most dexterous photographer in manual mode. The faster your camera, the 
more scenes you can shoot that are hard or impossible manually — moving 
clouds, some foliage, people (in some circumstances). AEB also opens up the 
world of hand-held, bracketed HDR photography.
Follow these steps to shoot auto exposure 
brackets. This example consists of five brack-
ets at +/–1.0 EV, as shown on the meter in 
Figure 5-12.
 
1. Set up your camera.
 
 See Chapter 4 for all things camera. This example consists of five brack-
ets at +/–1.0 EV, as shown on the meter in Figure 5-12.
 
2. Compose the scene.
 
3. Double-check the camera settings.
 
 Nothing worse than thinking you’re going to take five nice brackets of 
a scene only to find out (after the fact) you’re in the wrong shooting 
mode, forget to manually focus, and accidentally are at ISO 1600.
 
4. Meter the shot.
 
 For most cameras, press the shutter release (or remote) button halfway 
down to meter the scene.
 
 If you have a blazingly fast dSLR and are in continuous high-speed shooting 
mode, it’s easy to accidentally fire off ten shots while you’re trying to meter. 
Some cameras, like the Nikon D200, have alternate metering buttons. I use 
the AF-ON button (learn what every button does on your camera) to safely 
meter and auto focus without accidentally taking pictures.
Figure 5-12: Five brackets are 
set up at +/–1.0 EV.

105
 Chapter 5: Bracketing Exposures for HDR
 
5. If you’re in a shooting mode that requires you to set the exposure, do 
so by adjusting the shutter speed so that the EV index reads 0.0.
 
 Consider the following, though:
 
• You might need to offset the exposure or change the metering 
mode in conditions with extreme highs or lows. The problem is 
that there is often no way of knowing this until after you take a 
round of brackets.
 
 The upcoming example shots bear this out. The low bracket, shot 
at –2.0 EV, still blew out the clouds at the top right. Thankfully, you 
can manipulate Raw exposures easily in an editor. The exposure 
for this bracket was lowered to reveal details, and then saved as a 
new low bracket, adding to the total number. The final sequence 
was six exposures at –3/–2/–1/0/+1/+2 EV rather than the five 
original shots.
 
• If you have a live histogram on your camera, you can use it to esti-
mate whether you can capture the entire dynamic range in your 
sequence of brackets.
 
• If you’re in a semi-automatic or programmed mode, the camera 
might set the exposure automatically.
 
 With those caveats and alternate realities out the way, it’s time to 
continue.
 
6. Press and hold the shutter release button (or remote) to take the 
photos.
 
 Bada bing, bada boom. One set of brackets (as shown in Figure 5-13), 
coming up! Notice that the difference between each exposure is not tre-
mendous. This is because they are separated by +/– 1.0 EV. These brack-
ets cover the same range as three exposures at +/–2.0 EV.
Shooting multiple auto brackets
If you have AEB but don’t have the greatest EV range (at and under +/–1.0, 
like the Sony Alpha 300), you shoot multiple AEB sets one right after another 
to extend your dynamic range. Here’s how:
 
1. Set up to perform a standard AEB set.
 
 You’ll want to be in manual shooting mode or aperture priority for this.
 
2. Meter the shot.
 
3. Set the underexposed AEB exposure region.
 
 This works just like shooting manual brackets, only you’re shooting 
bracketed sets.

Figure 5-13: Five exposures shot using AEB separated by +/–1.0 EV.
 
 For example, if you’re using a compact digital camera that has AEB but 
limits the range to +/–1.0, a normal bracketed set would include expo-
sures at –1.0, 0.0, and +1.0 EV. Lower the initial exposure (through expo-
sure compensation on a compact digital camera without manual mode, 
or directly with shutter speed on a camera with more control) to –2.0 
EV. This set captures –3.0, –2.0 and –1.0 EV.

107
 Chapter 5: Bracketing Exposures for HDR
 
 In this example, I’m using an EV difference 
between brackets of +/–0.7 (two-thirds) of 
an EV. The EV range has been lowered, as 
shown in Figure 5-14, to center on –1.3 EV. 
The lower bracket extends to –2.0, and the 
upper bracket is at –0.7 EV.
 
4. Shoot the first set.
 
 Shoot each set as standard AEB. Press the shutter release button (or 
your remote) and hold it down to finish the set. Figure 5-15 shows the 
first three brackets, separated by +/–0.7 EV.
-2.0 EV
-1.3 EV
-0.7 EV
Figure 5-15: You see a smaller difference between exposures at +/–0.7 EV.
 
5.  Set the middle AEB exposure region.
 
 Raise the EV to 0.0. This is your center 
bracket with exposures at –0.7, 0.0, and 
+0.7 EV. The meter is shown in Figure 5-16. 
Notice that the lower bracket is a duplicate 
of the upper bracket of the first set.
 
6. Shoot the middle set.
 
 The middle set of brackets, as shown in Figure 5-17, acts like a center 
exposure of a normal bracketed set. If the clouds or other objects are 
moving too fast and you get smearing in the final image, you can fall 
back to this set and process it separately.

7. Set the upper AEB region.
 
 Raise the EV to +1.3. This captures brack-
ets at +0.7, +1.3, and +2.0 EV, as seen on the 
meter in Figure 5-18. Notice that the lower 
bracket is another duplicate.
 
8. Shoot the upper set.
 
 The last set is shown in Figure 5-19.
+0.7 EV

In the end, as seen in Figure 5-20, you’ll have nine bracketed photos. If you 
have shot with the exposure ranges in this example, you have exposures at 
–2.0, –1.3, –0.7, 0.0, +0.7, +1.3, and +2.0. Two of these are duplicates. You can 
toss those out during software processing. The final bracketed set comprises 
seven exposures +/–0.7 EV with a total range of 4 EV. Not ideal, but compared 
to having too little dynamic range for some scenes, it’s the way to go.

 Chapter 5: Bracketing Exposures for HDR
Using Alternate Metering Strategies
Using a preconceived bracketing strategy works well, but the downside is not 
knowing whether you’re really capturing the full dynamic range of the scene 
with the brackets (if you pay attention to a live histogram, you’re closer to 
knowing). A more studious approach relies on metering highs and lows in the 
scene with a light meter or your camera to come up with a more reliable esti-
mate of how many brackets you should shoot.
 
These strategies are not as accessible if you use exposure compensation. 
Most cameras limit the total EV compensation exposure range from –2.0 to 
+2.0 EV. Therefore, it’s important to have a camera with a manual shooting 
mode for these methods.
Working with a light meter
Using an external light meter takes a bit more time and preparation than setting 
up your camera and shooting normal brackets, not to mention the fact that you 
have to purchase a light meter with a spot mode. After the metering and figuring 
are done, however, you’ll shoot the photos much like manual bracketing.
Follow these steps to use the alternate metering strategy with a light meter:
 
1. Set up your light meter.
 
 Keep the aperture constant by using aperture priority mode on your 
light meter. Set ISO and aperture to the same as your camera.
 
 These examples use ISO 100 and the aperture of f/8. Changing these set-
tings won’t materially affect how you shoot anything — as long as you’re 
consistent within a bracketed set.
 
 Figure 5-21 shows my light meter (and 
my wife’s hand). The white thing at the 
top — a Lumisphere — is used to measure 
incident (as opposed to reflected) light. 
Incident mode is used to get an average 
exposure and set the shutter speed for 
0.0 EV.
 
 Use spot mode to meter the lows and 
highs. For this meter, you must look 
through the eyepiece on the right and out 
the spot lens to the left, which you aim at 
the location you want to measure.
 
 Please refer to your light meter manual for 
the specifics on how to configure and use 
your light meter.
Figure 5-21: An external light 
meter.

Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
 
2. Set up your camera for manual bracketing, as detailed in Chapter 4.
 
3. Compose the scene.
 
4. Meter a highlight with your external light meter.
 
 Figure 5-22 illustrates putting the spot circle of the light meter on a 
bright spot in the scene while taking a measurement. In this case, the 
bright front end on the car works well. You can take a few different mea-
surements of various areas of the scene (the sky, chrome, and so on) 
and choose the brightest one.
 
 Make a note of the shutter speed. This is where the high bracket is shot. 
In this case, it’s 1/1000 second.
 
5. Meter a shadow with the light meter.
 
 Figure 5-23 shows the meter looking at a dark area of the scene. Make a 
note of the reading. In this case, the shutter speed is 1/4 second.

6. Take an average light reading.
 
 Switch to Incident mode on your light meter and take an average reading 
of the scene. You can also use your camera for this, even when mounted 
on a tripod.
 
 This measures the overall exposure and gives you the shutter speed 
necessary to set exposure to 0.0 EV value. Make a note of the shutter 
speed. In this case, the reading is 1/60 second for 0.0 EV.
 
7. Calculate the points at which you want to bracket.
 
 You have now measured three data points and have three shutter 
speeds to show for it. You have the low and high points of the scene 
from Spot mode and the 0.0 EV point by using the Luminance mode 
(or your camera).
 
 Using this information, decide on a bracketing strategy (refer to 
Figures 5-22 and 5-23). Notice that the low bracket is at –4.0 EV and 
the correct shutter speed is 1/1000 second. This is where you set the 

112
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
camera for the first shot. Afterward, each bracket is incremented 
by +2.0 EV (shutter speeds are also shown) until the high point is 
also photographed.
 
 In this case, it’s nice — although not always the case — that the low 
and high points are at +/–4.0 EV, respectively, and that there is an even 
+/–2.0 EV difference that connects them.
 
 In situations where the figures aren’t as evenly spread, start at 0.0 EV 
and measure outward in both directions the number of EV you need to 
shoot to include the high and low values. It’s okay to go past them — 
but you don’t want to come up short.
What you do next depends on whether you’re using AEB or manual mode.
AEB
If you’re using AEB, set the center exposure (0.0 EV) on your camera and 
configure AEB settings (if possible) to include the number of shots and EV 
difference.
 
Make sure to account for the entire dynamic range of the scene. In other 
words, if you need a spread of 6.0 EV evenly centered on 0.0 EV (+/–3.0 EV), 
you can shoot six brackets at +/–1.0 EV to cover the scene. If the spread is 
7.0 EV (+/–3.5 EV from 0), you can shoot nine brackets at +/–1.0 EV or five 
brackets at +/–2.0 EV. These examples cover the entire range. If your camera 
is limited by the number of brackets or the exposure distance between them, 
you can settle for the best it can do, or revert to manual mode.
If your AEB has the capability and you have set the number of brackets and 
EV range, complete bracketing as you would normally using AEB. You can 
stop here.
Manual mode
If you’re using manual mode, complete the following steps:
 
1. Set the shutter speed to the value indicated by your calculation for the 
low end of the dynamic range you wish to capture.
 
 Although you can shoot them in any order you wish, I find it convenient 
to start at the underexposed end of the dynamic range and progress 
upward.
 
 Figure 5-24 illustrates the complete sequence, starting from low to high, 
including the shutter speeds.

113
 Chapter 5: Bracketing Exposures for HDR
Figure 5-24: Moving from low meter reading to high via brackets.
 
2. Shoot the bracketed photo.
 
3. Increment the shutter speed to space the bracket by the EV distance 
you desire: for example, 1.0 or 2.0 EV.
 
 Generally, three ticks of shutter speed equals +/–1.0 EV. Change by six 
ticks if you want to bracket by +/–2.0 EV.
 
4. Shoot another bracketed photo.
 
5. Plug and chug.
 
 Continue incrementing shutter speed and taking bracketed photos until 
you progress from the low end through the center exposure (0.0 EV) and 
complete at the top end.
 
 You finish with a complete, bracketed set of photos, as shown in Figure 
5-25. This result is a five-bracket set at +/–2.0 EV for a total range of 8 EV. 
Using this method, you know that you accounted for the entire dynamic 
range of the scene.

Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
Alternate metering with your camera
You can use your camera in place of an external light meter to perform the 
previous procedure, but it is decidedly more cumbersome.
 
The catch is to meter before mounting your camera on the tripod and com-
posing the scene. After you do this, moving the camera at all (which is nec-
essary to perform the spot metering) destroys the composition. If you’re 
shooting hand-held brackets, you can meter and bracket more fluidly.
To use your camera to meter highs and lows in the scene, try these general 
steps and then bracket the scene as described earlier:
 
1. Set up your camera for manual bracketing.
 
2. Perform a quick composition before you mount your camera on the 
tripod.
 
3. Switch your camera to spot metering mode.
 
4. Meter lows and highs.
 
5. Switch your camera to matrix or evaluative metering mode.
 
6. Take an average reading to set 0.0 EV.
 
7. Mount your camera on the tripod.
 
8. Dial in the final composition.
 
9. Determine EV range and shoot brackets.

Shooting Single-Exposure HDR
In This Chapter
▶ Breaking the rules with single-shot HDR
▶ Satisfying the minimum requirements
▶ Following a workflow
▶ Tone-Loc mapping
▶ Seeing the effectiveness of single-exposure HDR
U
nfortunately, digital cameras aren’t magic wands. Strike that. It’s 
probably better that they aren’t. Otherwise, you might be tempted 
to turn people into flower pots and yell things like, “Expecto Patronum!” or 
“Expelliarmus!” when you take your pictures.
Back to our story.
The technology simply doesn’t exist to enable you to 
go out and shoot bracketed HDR in every possible 
circumstance. When the conditions conspire against 
you, single-exposure HDR is a viable way to wring 
as much dynamic range from a single Raw photo 
as possible, and then tone map it like traditional, 
bracketed HDR. But, you have to be ready and 
willing (and have a camera that supports the Raw 
photo format). If you’re interested in HDR but don’t 
want to go to the trouble of setting up a tripod and 
shooting brackets, single-exposure HDR is a great 
way to get into HDR, experiment with it, and learn how 
to use the software.
This chapter shows you what single-exposure HDR (also 
known as single-shot HDR, pseudo-HDR, or a tone mapped Raw 
exposure) is all about, how to do it, and why.

116
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
Knowing When to Break the Rules
Unless you plan on abandoning any pretense of shooting brackets, you need 
to know when and why to shoot single exposures for HDR. This assures that 
you choose the right tool for the job, given the gear you have and the circum-
stance you’re in.
When to shoot single exposures for HDR basically boils down to movement:
 
✓ You’re moving. If you’re moving around, you can’t always take brack-
eted photos. If you have a fast-enough camera and AEB, you might be 
able to get off three shots without blurring or alignment problems. For 
the most part, though, you won’t be able to.
 
 This isn’t the same as standing still and taking hand-held, bracketed 
HDR. You can get off good brackets in that case — if you have a high 
frame rate (3 frames per second [fps] is adequate but 5 fps is very nice 
to have) and use AEB.
 
 You might think the solution to this is to always use a tripod or 
monopod (easier to manage but not as stable). That might be true. 
Sometimes, however, that’s impossible. This situation is illustrated in 
Figure 6-1, where I am taking a photo from inside a train ride at our local 
zoo. Although I’m reasonably stable (there’s a joke in there somewhere) 
and I’m holding the camera steady, there is enough motion in this scene 
to make bracketing pointless. No camera can take bracketed photos of 
the scenery rushing past.
Figure 6-1: Riding the train to single-exposure HDR.

117
 Chapter 6: Shooting Single-Exposure HDR
 
✓ The subject is moving (or 
can’t be still). The other cir-
cumstance that will push you 
out of your bracket-shooting 
comfort zone is when your 
subject is moving: say, when 
you’re photographing people 
or animals. You might be 
standing still and have your 
camera mounted on a sturdy 
tripod, but if the subject is 
moving, you won’t be able 
to get off brackets without 
enormous alignment 
problems.
 
 Figure 6-2 shows this situation 
in action. I’m standing just 
outside a paddock at a friend’s farm when this beautiful horse galloped 
past, too fast to make brackets possible.
Figure 6-2: Galloping toward 
single-exposure HDR.
Terminology alert!
HDR has a lot of terminology competing to use 
the same four words (exposure, bracket, Raw, 
and Rumpelstiltskin). It can be very confusing. 
For the purpose of this chapter, I distinguish 
between two types of single-exposure HDR, 
both created from one original Raw exposure 
(the photo). I use the terms single-exposure 
(Raw) and single-exposure (brackets).
When you see single-exposure (Raw), that 
indicates that the Raw photo from the camera 
is opened directly in the HDR application (such 
as Photomatix Pro) and tone mapped. No inter-
vening steps are necessary. You don’t convert 
the Raw photo to TIFFs (bracketed or single), 
nor do you technically generate an HDR file. 
Photomatix Pro automatically generates a 
pseudo-HDR file for you to tone map when you 
drop the Raw exposure into the interface or 
open it from the menu. As such, there are no 
options when you generate the pseudo-HDR file 
like when you use normal brackets.
Single-exposure (brackets) refers to the pro-
cess where you take the original Raw photo 
from the camera and use your Raw editor to 
create brackets. I sometimes call them soft-
ware brackets or pseudo-brackets to differen-
tiate them from bracketed exposures captured 
at the scene. After you convert the Raw file 
into software-bracketed TIFFs or JPEGs, the 
process continues as if they were standard 
brackets. The HDR application won’t know the 
difference, but you might need to clarify the EV 
range between each image.

118
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
You might want to shoot single 
exposures for HDR, though, in 
these circumstances:
 
✓ Casual shooting: Maybe 
you’re out for a walk with your 
camera, exploring your neigh-
borhood. You didn’t take your 
tripod with you, and you don’t 
have a camera with AEB and a 
fast frame rate (which makes 
hand-held HDR effectively 
impossible). Solution? Take 
photos in Raw and process 
them as single-exposure HDR.
 
 I took the photo in Figure 6-3 
as I walked around our local 
Johnny Appleseed Festival. I 
saw the photogenic gentleman 
in question and asked to take 
his picture. This is a perfect situation for casual photography and 
single-exposure HDR.
 
✓ Bracketing problems: Say you did set your 
camera to photograph brackets and suc-
cessfully completed the shoot, only to find 
out in software that you have problems, 
such as ghosting or something movement 
related, as shown in Figure 6-4. This close 
crop of a car moving away from the camera 
while I shot the brackets created ghosting, 
so the car appears in each bracket in a dif-
ferent position.
 
 You can ignore these problems if you want 
(although not always recommended — see 
Chapter 15) and press ahead, or use single-
exposure HDR to process one bracket to use as an overlay and freeze 
the situation. I cover this more fully in Chapter 10.
Satisfying the Minimum Requirements
The requirements for single-exposure HDR are somewhat different than brack-
eted HDR. The least you need to have, in addition to other helpful suggestions, 
comprises
Figure 6-4: Use single-exposure 
HDR techniques to correct 
ghosting problems.
Figure 6-3: Shooting for HDR on the fly.

119
 Chapter 6: Shooting Single-Exposure HDR
 
✓ File format: You must shoot in Raw. It’s that simple. JPEGs need not 
apply.
 
✓ Gear:
 
• Camera: The camera must support Raw, of course. Any camera will 
do, but you’ll be most satisfied with a dSLR. Premium compacts 
and super-zooms that support the Raw file format will work but 
have much more noise, especially at higher ISOs. Not many (if any) 
budget compact cameras support Raw.
 
• Tripod: You don’t need a tripod for single-exposure HDR unless 
you’re a real stickler for stability and the conditions allow it. (You 
can try a monopod if you want to steady your camera without the 
hassle of a tripod. You’ll look like a sideline photographer at the 
Super Bowl.)
 
✓ Software: Single-exposure HDR uses the same complement of software 
that bracketed HDR uses. Depending on the workflow you choose (Raw 
or brackets), you might need a Raw editor.
Work-flow, Flow, Flow Your Boat
By and large, single-exposure HDR follows the same workflow as bracketed HDR:
 
1. Configure your camera as described in Chapter 4, paying special attention 
to the material that prepares you to shoot single-shot HDR.
 
 The thing you’re after is the single best shot you can get. Pay attention 
to the lighting conditions, subject, movement, and any artistic effect 
(depth of field, motion blur, and so on) you’re after.
 
 If you’re shooting in manual exposure mode, review the information on 
exposure in Chapter 4, paying special attention to exposure control side 
effects. If you use auto, a priority mode, or programmed auto mode, you 
have fewer decisions to make.
 
2. Compose the scene.
 
 For single-exposure HDR, this step can take anywhere from 1/4000 
second to several minutes, depending on the scene and situation. With 
most casual shots, you simply point and shoot — you have very little 
time to compose the shot. For arranged shots, you can often position 
your subject or take your time and analyze different angles. This is 
where your composition skills shine.

120
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
 
3. Take the photos.
 
 Even if you can’t bracket, you can still set your camera to shoot individ-
ual exposures at high speeds (continuous high-speed shooting). In fact, 
I recommend taking several bursts of shots, if possible, so you’ll have a 
range of single exposures to choose from.
 
4. Choose your single-exposure method in software.
 
 Choose from two approaches when using single Raw exposures for HDR:
 
• Single-exposure (Raw): Throw the Raw photo into your HDR appli-
cation and create pseudo-HDR from a single source image. As 
bizarre as it sounds, using a single image can work — and it pro-
duces excellent results much of the time. It’s not truly HDR, but it 
has something to do with HDR.
 
 Figure 6-5 shows a flowering tree in HDR. The Raw exposure was 
dropped into Photomatix and processed directly as pseudo-HDR. 
The colors are simply maahvelous.
Raw

121
 Chapter 6: Shooting Single-Exposure HDR
 
• Single-exposure (brackets): Process the single Raw exposure into 
brackets by opening it up in a Raw editor and saving versions of 
the file with different exposures. Three brackets at –2/0/+2 EV 
is generally accepted as the best method. You might wish to 
experiment with five brackets at –2/– 1/0/+1/2 EV or other 
combinations.
 
 You’re still working with a single Raw image, no matter how many 
brackets you create. You can’t increase the dynamic range of squat 
with single-exposure HDR. What you’re doing is trying to squeeze 
all the dynamic range you can from the single image. For more 
information on this process, please hop over to Chapter 7 and 
then come back.
 
 When finished, you’ll have two or more bracketed images that you 
can treat the same as any other bracketed set. Load them into your 
HDR application to generate the HDR image. Figure 6-6 shows the 
collection of images surrounding this method. Start with an original 
Raw photo, which you then transform into brackets (three, in this 
case). The brackets form the source for the HDR image, which is 
tone mapped and finalized.
 
5. Generate HDR.
 
 If you’re using a single Raw exposure, you can drop it on Photomatix 
Pro, which will automatically generate the pseudo-HDR image and 
start the tone mapping process. (Photomatix Pro is the only HDR 
application at this time that features pseudo-HDR from a single Raw 
exposure.)
 
 If you’re working with manually generated brackets, generate the HDR 
image as you would normally. You don’t need to align the images or 
worry about ghosting, so you can turn off those options (if available). 
You might need to identify the relative EV difference between the 
images. Please see Chapter 7 for a detailed walkthrough.
 
6. Tone map the single Raw exposure or brackets.
 
 For detailed information on tone mapping, see Chapters 8 and 9. 
Single-exposure HDR tone mapping advice is given in the following 
sections.
 
 As with HDR in general, it’s hard to predict whether an image will look 
good, or how much you can push the settings to accentuate details and 
drama.

 Figure 6-7 shows a photo of my son Jacob being tone mapped in 
Photomatix Pro. The settings produce a fairly realistic look.
 
7. Edit and publish the tone mapped image.
 
 As with multi-exposure HDR, finish your project by editing it in your 
favorite image editor. Single-exposure HDR tends to be noisier, but on 
the other hand, you don’t have to worry about ghosting or movement. 
You might need to perform tasks such as noise reduction, sharpening, 
adjusting brightness and contrast, color, cropping, and publishing. For 
more information on this step, see Chapters 10 and 11.

123
 Chapter 6: Shooting Single-Exposure HDR
Figure 6-7: Tone mapping is where you determine the overall look of the image.
Tone Mapping Single Exposures
More complete coverage on tone mapping is presented later in the book 
(Chapters 8 and 9). However, to make this a more practical chapter, I 
decided to jump the gun a bit and show a few examples of tone mapping 
single exposures.
 
Technically, tone mapping single exposures (whether Raw or a Raw con-
verted to brackets) is identical to tone mapping bracketed exposures. The 
difference is that you probably shot different subjects and scenes. For exam-
ple, bracketed HDR excels at shooting landscapes, cityscapes, objects, and 
interiors. These are the more traditional HDR scenes. Single-exposure HDR 
tends to involve shots of people, animals, action and other dynamic scenes, 
and casual shots.
Shooting single-exposure HDR on the go
This example is another reason single-exposure HDR is so much fun and 
accessible. My wife took this shot (Figure 6-8) of our oldest son, Ben. I’m the 
family HDR expert who carries around bags of gear and a tripod. She likes 

124
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
taking our smaller, lighter dSLR (a Sony Alpha 300) with the kit lens, and 
shooting on the go. I have her use RAW+JPEG so that I have access to the 
Raw exposures for HDR. It’s perfect.
In this case, the single Raw exposure was converted to three 16-bit TIFFs to 
start. In Photomatix Pro, the default tone mapping settings (using the Details 
Enhancer tab) were too “vanilla.” However, the settings I use as a starting 
point for multi-exposure HDR (my baseline) were too harsh.
 
At times (especially when tone mapping people), expect to reduce the 
Strength setting and increase the Micro-Smoothing setting. This keeps faces 
from being too detailed and riddled with dark lines. (Although there are 
cases where this is what you want, that’s not what I wanted my 7-year-old 
to look like!) The result is a nice balance between color, clarity, and detail 
in his face.

After

The clouds, however, were another story. They were too dark and ruined 
the effect. This is where you have to let yourself go a little bit and realize 
your boss isn’t standing over your shoulder checking your work. I love HDR, 
but when I run into its limits, I don’t lose any sleep over using what looks 
best (and accomplishing that in an image editor after tone mapping is 
completed). Unless you’re entering a contest with strict rules or are other-
wise in a situation where your methods are restricted, give yourself that 
freedom, too.

125
 Chapter 6: Shooting Single-Exposure HDR
I took the tone mapped image of Ben and used the un-HDR-ified Raw image 
for the clouds. Then I blended them in Photoshop Elements to capture the 
best of both worlds. For more information on this kind of blending, see 
Chapter 10.
Increasing contrast and details
Figure 6-9 illustrates an action shot that is impossible to bracket. This Monster 
Truck Rally is one of those “not quite ready for prime time” photos that some-
how is still compelling. Nothing is really sharp, but the movement and colors 
faithfully impart the impact of the scene. The rider just coming around the near 
pylon is the least blurred, which draws your attention to him.
Those factors make realism less important in this scene as it otherwise might 
be. My main goal was to bring out the small details in the scene — contrast 
in the grass, the riders, and the quads. I took the single Raw exposure and 
converted it into three software brackets. Then in Photomatix Pro, I set the 
Strength to 100 and reduced the Smoothing setting to High. This accentuates 
contrast and local details. I increased the Luminosity setting to +5.0 to bring 
even more details out of the shadows. The final look was attained by a mod-
erate amount of noise reduction and saturation in Photoshop afterward.
Reducing noise
Figure 6-10 shows the controls of a fire engine. (I’m still using the pictures I 
took on that casual trip out with the family!)
 
The reason I go on about what I was doing when I captured photos is to give 
you ideas of where you can go to get interesting shots. You’ll exhaust the 
flowers in your backyard in about 15 minutes. After that, you need to venture 
out farther to find interesting subjects.

After

126
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
The tone mapping settings for Figure 6-10 aren’t all that remarkable. Strength is 
100, and Color Saturation is at 80. Luminosity is 4.0, and Micro-smoothing is at 
6.2. No extreme smoothing or other tricks were used. The point of this example 
is to show you a representative sample of the noise levels you can see coming 
from a single Raw exposure tone mapped in Photomatix. As you can see, noise 
is definitely visible in this image. It appears more strongly in darker areas, but 
is especially visible in even-toned areas of any brightness — clouds, blue sky, 
glass, and other smooth materials. You catch a break if your subject has a lot 
of texture. This hides noise. (Other than a slight levels adjustment to warm up 
this image and cropping, this photo is unretouched, so you can see the noise 
for what it is.)
Using a single Raw photo without 
converting to brackets
Figure 6-11 shows a close shot of a hawk at the zoo. It is a beautiful bird, and I 
was standing no more than 5 feet from it when I took the photo. This example 
illustrates using a single Raw photo without converting it to brackets in a 
Raw editor. The Raw photo was simply dropped in Photomatix Pro and tone 
mapped. I compared the differences, and the bird looked better using the 
Raw photo. That is always the criteria I use — what looks better.

Figure 6-10: Single-exposure HDR can be noisier than bracketed HDR.

127
 Chapter 6: Shooting Single-Exposure HDR
 
In this case, a realistic shot seemed the most appropriate. To achieve this 
effect, Strength was kept very low (40 out of 100) and Micro-smoothing was 
increased to 19.3. This kept the image looking realistic. Luminosity and 
Microcontrast were both maximized (+10.0), which lightened the shadows and 
increased local area contrast respectively. This basically balanced the light in 
the photo. Normally, when you increase Luminosity and Microcontrast, you 
get a more dramatic look. Lowering Strength was the key to keeping that from 
happening.

Comparing Results
Quite frankly, the dodgiest aspect of HDR photography is the lack of con-
sistency regarding what method (of the many) to use to achieve the best 
appearance in the final image. I can tell you what methods are technically 
the best — those which preserve the greatest dynamic range in a scene and 
make the least number of compromises along the way. However, following 
the best technical methodology does not always translate into the best look-
ing image, which is what HDR and photography are about.
This section features a Mini Cooper. Three processing options are shown: a 
developed Raw photo, tone mapping as a single-exposure (Raw), and tone 
mapping as a single-exposure (brackets). The latter two use the same settings 
in Photomatix Pro. None of the images have been spruced up in Photoshop.

128
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
Let the faceoff begin:
 
✓ A developed Raw photo: Figure 6-12 is the control image, processed as 
a single Raw photo and exported as a TIFF. This is basically what you get 
out of the camera in the form of a JPEG. The shot is rather bland, and 
the lightness of the sky predominates. On the positive side, the details 
look pretty good and there is not much noise. All in all, not a very good 
look here. The photo needs work.
Figure 6-12: A standard Raw photo.
 
✓ Single-exposure (Raw): Figure 6-13 shows the results of the Raw exposure 
bring dropped directly into Photomatix Pro and tone mapped. I purpose-
fully went for some drama because I thought the clouds and car looked 
much better this way. Compared with the Raw photo, this has better light 
balance between the subject (the Mini) and the background (the sky). 
In fact, they reversed: The car is now lighter, and the sky as a whole is 
darker. The metallic paint of the car stands out much better, too.
 
 Despite what some might say about single-exposure (Raw) photos, this 
is an acceptable image. In fact, more than that — it looks really good, as 
long as you don’t mind it not being a photocopy of the original.
 
✓ Single-exposure (brackets): Figure 6-14 shows the result of tone mapping 
a Raw exposure converted to three brackets (–2/0/+2 EV). (For more infor-
mation on converting a Raw exposure into brackets, see Chapter 7.) Like 
the single-exposure (Raw) image, it was tone mapped in Photomatix Pro 
with identical settings. This version might have a little less contrast, but 
the car is improved. It looks green now, which is its true color.

129
 Chapter 6: Shooting Single-Exposure HDR
 
 Overall, this looks to be the best version of this image. It has better 
color, good dynamics, light balance, texture, and details. This doesn’t 
always translate to every picture under the sun, but there is nothing 
inherently wrong with this method — it produces good results.

130
Part II: Putting the Photography in HDR Photography 
 
You can see that the difference between single-exposure (Raw) and single-
exposure (brackets) are often a matter of taste. I happen to like the latter 
method on this image, but there are times when I prefer the former. The pur-
pose of this comparison is to disprove the point that either of these methods 
is pointless. They’re not. They clearly add value to the original image.
 
The moral of this story is this: Do not discount single-exposure HDR from the 
outset as being technologically inferior. It can and does produce images close 
in quality to those created from multiple bracketed sets. It may not do so in 
every instance, but that’s when you get to use your skills and judgment as a 
photographer and artist to decide. Use all the tools at your disposal to create 
the images that match your style the best.

H
DR is as much about software as it is about 
taking photos, so this part immerses you in 
the software process of generating and tone map-
ping an HDR image, and then editing and publish-
ing your ﬁ nal image.
Chapter 7 starts the ball rolling by showing you 
how to turn your bracketed (or single exposure) 
photos into HDR images. This interim step is nec-
essary and important, so don’t skip this chapter. 
Chapter 8 provides a ton of tone mapping refer-
ence material so you understand what you’re 
doing when you tone map in Chapter 9, which is 
the other “most important chapter” in the book. 
I walk you through how to tone map your HDR 
images in Photomatix Pro. Aside from taking the

get a large dose of an editing workﬂ ow, followed 
by helpful blending techniques. Chapter 11 ﬁ n-
ishes this part by showing you different ways to 
ﬁ x problems in your images (ranging from too 
much noise, distractions, and distortion) and 
enhance the good parts (such as contrast, color, 
and highlights). I ﬁ nish with a section on publish-

Generating HDR
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding HDR images and files
▶ Converting Raw photo brackets for HDR
▶ Converting single Raw photos to brackets
▶ Generating HDR from your source images
You might think the whole point of HDR photography is to produce an HDR 
image or file, right? Wrong. The point of HDR photography, outside of the 
laboratory and other technical venues, is to create a usable (for the rest of us) 
low dynamic range image that you can view and print with technology that is 
generally available today. To get that image, most likely a JPEG or TIFF, you 
need HDR images and sometimes files. (I explain the difference between images 
and files in this chapter.) Time for a little “howdy-do.”
An HDR image’s claim to fame is that it’s nothing like a 
normal photo or image file. Rather, it’s a specialized, 
high dynamic range image created by analyzing 
and merging pixel data from a bunch of differ-
ently exposed photographs. It works a little like 
Goldilocks and the Three Bears. This one’s too hot. 
This one’s too cold. This one’s juuust right.
Unless you’re applying for a job at Industrial Light 
and Magic, you don’t need to know all the intricacies 
and inner workings of HDR images and file types, the 
complex algorithms that decide which pixel is better 
than another, or what data types programmers use to 
create HDR images and files. What you need to master — 
which just happens to be the subject of this chapter — are the 
tools and techniques to create HDR images and files for further use.
The Unbearable Lightness of HDR
Sometimes HDR terminology can be confusing. Everything is HDR this 
and HDR that. Create, generate, save, shoot, publish, manipulate HDR. 

134
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Does this refer to photos, an open file, a saved file, the final product, or 
something else?
 
Thankfully, it’s much simpler than that. Two components of HDR photogra-
phy are at the heart of the matter: HDR images and HDR files. These are the 
things in HDR photography that put the H and the D in the R. Other activities 
help create, manage, or transform them.
HDelightfullyR images and files
HDR images and files have the following general properties:
 
✓ HDR image: An HDR image is a high-bit–depth image (normally 32 bits 
per channel) that contains color and brightness information across a very 
wide dynamic range. When you generate HDR or load a saved HDR file in 
an application, something like Figure 7-1 shows up onscreen. This is an 
HDR image comprising bracketed photos. It doesn’t look very good in this 
format, though, because the clouds are blown out and parts of the green-
ery are too dark. The data is in the file, but the image has more dynamic 
range than the system on which it’s being displayed can handle.
 
 An HDR image is an ephemeral thing: It exists to be transformed. You 
can edit HDR images in most HDR software before you get to tone map-
ping (mapping data with a large dynamic range into a smaller dynamic 
range). Tone mapping is discussed in depth in Chapters 8 and 9. You 
may be able to reduce the level of noise in the HDR image, rotate it, 
examine properties (such as bit depth), look at the histogram, or crop it.
Figure 7-1: An HDR image onscreen before tone mapping.

135
 Chapter 7: Generating HDR
 
✓ HDR file: An HDR file is an HDR image encoded and saved by HDR soft-
ware to retain the high dynamic range nature of the originally generated 
data. HDR files use an internal scheme defined by the unique HDR file 
format you choose, which is the subject of the next section.
Oddly enough, there is very little you can do with HDR images and files 
besides view them with specialized software or turn them into something 
else. The “something else,” for HDR photographers, is a low dynamic range 
TIFF or JPEG that displays properly on monitors, plays well with Web brows-
ers and iPhones, and can be printed.
 
An HDR file is simply a stepping stone. It rests between the photographs you 
take with your camera and the final file you proudly show everyone. You won’t 
print it out, post it online, or even look at it very much on your monitor.
Choosing an HDR file format
When you create an HDR image, you’ll often be given the chance to save it as 
an HDR file for later use. Whether you save it as an HDR file depends partly 
on preference and partly on what you plan on doing. Normally, you’ll jump 
right into tone mapping, save the final low dynamic range result, and never 
miss not having an HDR file stored on your hard drive. In cases where you 
might be testing a number of different settings on a single HDR image, how-
ever, saving an HDR file the first time through will save you time in the long 
run because you won’t have to continually re-create it. You can load the HDR 
file and work with new settings in a snap. Another scenario where using an 
HDR file saves you time and trouble is if you want to share it with someone 
and don’t want the hassle of tracking multiple photo files. Generate the HDR, 
and then make that available for others to tone map.
If you decide to save an HDR file, you must choose a format from several 
competing HDR file formats. Three, however, are very widespread and 
deserve special attention — these are summarized in Table 7-1.

136
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
In case you’re wondering, I generally use the Radiance format when I need to 
save an HDR file because it preserves the greatest dynamic range without exces-
sive file bloating — and it’s the first file type in the Save as Type drop-down list 
in Photmatix Pro. (For more information about Radiance RGBE and OpenEXR for-
mats, see www.radiance-online.org and www.openexr.com, respectively.)
 
Thankfully, HDR photography comes down to the photos. This isn’t a contest to 
see who can create the HDR file with the greatest dynamic range or a strict com-
parison of bits and precision. It’s about taking and presenting beautiful pictures.
Converting Raw Photos
One of the great things about HDR photography is that you can tailor your work-
flow to the amount of effort and picture quality that are important to you. You 
don’t have to shoot Raw photos if you don’t want to or your camera can’t. If you 
shoot in Raw, you don’t have to convert those photos to another format (TIFF or 
JPEG) before you generate the HDR image. If you wish to, however, you can con-
vert your Raw photos and save them in one of a few different formats.
Different approaches yield different results, of course. Consider these issues 
when deciding whether to convert Raw photos:
 
✓ Quality: In general, you achieve the best quality by shooting Raw 
photos and converting them to 16-bit TIFFs for use in HDR. Trailing this 
“Qualitus Maximus” option is converting the Raw photos to 8-bit TIFFs, 
then using camera JPEGs, followed by using the unconverted Raw files 
themselves (the HDR software converts them automatically, leaving you 
no control). Choose the quality you need and can afford, bearing in mind 
that different software choices can produce different results.
 
 Figure 7-2 illustrates two small sections of a tone mapped HDR image 
created from different source image types. The original five bracketed 
Raw photos are Nikon NEF files and have been processed through Nikon 
Capture NX 2 to create the 8- and 16-bit TIFFs. The JPEGs were gener-
ated in-camera. Photomatix Pro was used to generate the HDR and tone 
map the result.
 
 JPEG — and sometimes Raw appearance — can be dramatically affected 
by the processing options you choose in the camera.
 
 Comparing two areas reveals different effects of the format in use:
 
• Clouds and sky: The TIFFs are relatively equal in quality, with 
details and textures well preserved. You can see the nuances of 
the cloud and sky in both TIFFs. The JPEG and Raw have lost detail 
and take on a color cast by comparison.

137
 Chapter 7: Generating HDR
 
• Words and sign: All four source image types show fairly good 
quality for this man-made object. The JPEG is surprisingly good 
although the colors are close to being oversaturated. Notice that 
the image generated from the Raw photos is the softest.
 
✓ Workflow: If you’re shooting a tremendous number of photos for HDR, 
or perhaps you’re shooting a large number of photos in general and 
need to fit HDR into an existing workflow, using different processes for 
different images can be an issue. For example, if you use Apple Aperture 
and that’s where you spend all your conversion and editing time, using 
something else can throw a wrench into things. Choose the workflow 
that makes you want to create HDR, not throw it out the window.
 
✓ Cost: Cameras, gear, and most software cost money (see Chapters 2 and 
3). If your supply of cash is limited, start where you can (the inexpensive 
and free stuff) and move up to more expensive options when you can. 
Don’t sweat it.
 
✓ Single Raw exposures: The same principles apply to converting single 
Raw exposures.

Figure 7-2: Comparing different conversions.
Principle principles
Converting Raw photos for HDR requires a different mindset than traditional 
digital photo processing, which aims to create the best looking photo pos-
sible. Here are a few differences:

138
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
 
✓ Don’t mess with exposure. The point of bracketed photos is to have dif-
ferent exposures, so it’s best to leave this alone unless you’re converting 
a single Raw photo to exposure brackets.
 
✓ Don’t rescue detail from highlights or shadows. HDR takes care of this 
in tone mapping.
 
✓ Avoid dynamic range adjustments. Some Raw editors have dynamic 
range adjustments that play with shadow and highlight detail, bringing 
them together. This defeats the purpose of HDR.
 
✓ Be careful about making color and tone changes. If you must make 
color and tone changes (for practical or artistic reasons), be consistent 
unless you’re experimenting with color variations between brackets.
 
✓ Fix white balance if necessary. You can delay fixing the white balance, 
but if you prefer, fix it now. White balance corrections compensate for 
different lighting that can impart a colored tint to your photos or turn 
what should be white to a shade of gray.
 
✓ Don’t over-sharpen. Sharpening bracketed photos is often an important 
part of getting a good, sharp result in HDR. Don’t overdo it, though, or 
artifacts will be magnified in HDR.
 
Be careful of making changes that make tone mapping harder and increase 
the level of noise or artifacts in your images. Trust the HDR part of the pro-
cess to do what it’s supposed to do (enhance details, contrast, and control 
exposure) while using the Raw editor’s strengths to convert Raw photos.
Converting bracketed photos
If you decide to convert bracketed Raw photos to TIFFs or JPEGs before gen-
erating the HDR image, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the bracketed source images in your Raw editor.
 
2. Make the necessary changes to the conversion settings.
 
 Keep a light hand on the controls, as shown in Figure 7-3, which shows 
several brackets of an old, abandoned dump truck. You’re not after the 
Mona Lisa in this step. Remember the principle principles (see the pre-
ceding section).
 
 Develop presets based on your favorite conversion settings to speed 
things up. You might have a preset that performs a straight conver-
sion, another with more noise reduction, and another that sharpens the 
image a bit. Choose the appropriate preset and apply.

139
 Chapter 7: Generating HDR
Figure 7-3: Converting several Raw brackets with Adobe Camera Raw.
 
3. Save the result.
 
 Saving converted Raw files as 
16-bit TIFFs results in the high-
est quality but the largest file 
size. 8-bit TIFFs are the next 
best choice, with JPEG bring-
ing up the rear.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 on the 
rest of the bracketed photos.
 
Many Raw converters allow batch 
processing. Figure 7-4 shows the 
Batch Process dialog box from 
Nikon Capture NX 2. Set up a con-
version preset, name it something 
logical, and then run the batch rou-
tine on the bracketed Raw photos. 
Make sure to save the results as 8- 
or 16-bit TIFFs or JPEGs. This is a 
great time-saver when you dump 
300 pictures from a photo shoot 
onto your computer!

Capture NX 2.

Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Creating brackets from one Raw exposure
You can create brackets from a single Raw exposure by altering the exposure 
value (EV) in your Raw editor and saving the results. Here’s how to perform 
the procedure in Adobe Camera Raw:
 
1. Open the single Raw source image in Photoshop Elements or 
Photoshop to launch Adobe Camera Raw.
 
 Adobe Camera Raw can’t be launched as a separate process. It automati-
cally opens when you open or drop a Raw photo in Photoshop.
 
2. Make any necessary changes to the image.
 
 You might want to carefully sharpen and tweak color temperature or 
white balance. The restrictions here are less stringent than editing sepa-
rate brackets because this image serves as the master bracket.
 
3. Lower the exposure by –2.0 EV by adjusting the Exposure slider or 
entering –2.0 in the Exposure text box.
 
 The Exposure slider is on the Basic tab, as shown in Figure 7-5, whose 
icon is a small, six-blade diaphragm (creating a lens aperture). Select the 
tab if you can’t see the Exposure slider.
Figure 7-5: Saving the lower bracket from a single Raw photo.

141
 Chapter 7: Generating HDR
 
 This gives you the underexposed image, 
as seen in the top image in Figure 7-6. 
Notice the effect lowering the exposure 
has on the highlights. In this case, the 
sky and white shed have gone from close 
to being washed out to nicely exposed. 
You can experiment with lowering the 
EV by smaller increments and creating 
more files if you like, but you should 
have a total range of at least +/–4.0 EV 
across your brackets.
 
4. Save the lower bracket as a new file.
 
 It helps to use a file naming convention. 
For example, I prefer to keep the origi-
nal filename and append information 
at the end, such as the bracket number 
(DSC_1303-01.tif, DSC_1303-02.
tif, DSC_1303-03.tif), add the Raw 
application I used (DSC_1303-acr-01.
tif), or specify a preset (DSC_1303-
noisereduction-01.tif).
 
 For the highest quality, choose 16-bit 
TIFF. If space is a concern, choose 8-bit 
TIFF. You can choose JPEG if you like, 
but your HDR image may suffer from 
noise problems as a result.
 
5. Raise the exposure back to 0.0 EV by 
adjusting the Exposure slider or enter-
ing 0.0 in the Exposure text box.
 
 This is your center, perfectly exposed 
bracket. (See the middle image in 
Figure 7-6.)
 
6. Save the middle bracket.
 
 Choose the same format as the previ-
ous bracket. Remember to name this 
bracket something different than the 
first bracket. I simply increment my own 
bracket number, as described in Step 4.
 
7. Raise the exposure to +2.0 EV by adjust-
ing the Exposure slider or entering +2.0 
in the Exposure text box.
 
 Third time’s the charm. This is the over-
exposed bracket. (See the bottom image 
in Figure 7-6.) Notice that the other 
-2.0 EV

+2.0 EV

converted to three brackets.

142
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
settings are the same. That’s 
pretty important.
 
8. Save the upper bracket.
 
 Choose the same format as the 
previous brackets. Name appro-
priately, using the convention 
you’ve decided upon (see Step 4 
for helpful guidance).
Figure 7-7 illustrates the finalized 
HDR image that was created from 
the three bracketed images in 
Figure 7-6.
Creating HDR
As I discuss earlier in this chapter, an HDR image is different than the tone 
mapped image. HDR images are generated first, and then tone mapped to 
transform them into a relatively finished product. HDR images are created 
from source photos, and tone mapping works on the HDR image.
The following sections explain how to create HDR images in the leading HDR 
applications: Photomatix Pro and Photoshop. Remember that you can use 
bracketed JPEGs, TIFFs, or Raw exposures as your source images for HDR. If 
you’re using a single file, it has to be a Raw photo or 16-bit TIFF.
 
If you like how one application creates HDR images but can’t stand how it 
tone maps them, create the HDR image in it, save it as an HDR file, and then 
open it in a different HDR application (the one you prefer to tone map in). 
You are free to be as creative as you want!
Photomatix Pro
Photomatix Pro has a powerful yet straightforward process for generating HDR:
 
1. Launch Photomatix.
 
 You can also invoke Photomatix Pro from within Lightroom or Aperture 
if you have the export plug-ins installed.
Figure 7-7: The finalized HDR photo.

143
 Chapter 7: Generating HDR
 
2. Select Generate HDR image 
from the Workflow Shortcuts 
dialog box.
 
 Alternatively, choose Process➪
Generate HDR. The Generate 
HDR — Selecting Source Images 
dialog box opens for you to 
select bracketed images with.
 
3. Select the bracketed source 
images.
 
 Click the Browse button to 
browse to the folder on your 
system that contains the brack-
eted sources images you want 
to use for HDR. Select them one at a time or together, and click Open to 
add them to the Generate HDR dialog box (as shown in Figure 7-8).
 
4. Click OK to continue.
 
 If Photomatix can decode 
the exposure information 
without your help, it displays 
the Generate HDR – Options 
dialog box, as described in 
the next step.
 
 If there isn’t EXIF information 
(data in the photo file that 
contains helpful information 
like the time it was taken, the 
exposure settings, and so 
on) in the files, or perhaps 
you saved brackets from the 
same original Raw exposure, 
Photomatix might ask you 
to correct the EV spacing, as 
shown in Figure 7-9. Notice 
that you can select a range 
from the drop-down list or 
enter values yourself. Click OK 
to finish correcting exposure 
information.

5. Choose the HDR options 
you wish from the Generate 
HDR – Options dialog box.
 
 The Generate HDR — Options 
dialog box is shown in Figure 
7-10. This has a lot of options, 
but you’ll be clicking through 
them in no time.
 
 Select from the following 
options that appear in the 
dialog box:
 
• Align Source Images: 
Select this check box 
if you’re concerned 
with slight movement 
of the camera. Choose 
a method that fits the 
type of problem you 
may be having. The By Correcting Horizontal and Vertical Shifts 
option is best used for small adjustments, and the By Matching 
Features option works better for larger alignment problems, such 
as hand-held bracketing. Select the Don’t Crop check box to keep 
the images at their original size, regardless of shifting caused by 
alignment. You might see rows of irregularly exposed pixels on the 
border of your image if you deselect Don’t Crop. Cropping auto-
matically removes them.
 
• Reduce Chromatic Aberrations: Select this check box to reduce 
red/cyan/blue/yellow fringing. This can be a problem when edge 
contrast and saturation is high, especially when shooting toward 
brighter lighting, like the sun.
 
• Reduce Noise: Select this check box to reduce noise in the com-
bined HDR image. Reducing noise at this stage can give you more 
headroom when you tone map. Alternatively, if you have a good 
noise-reduction routine in your graphics application, you might 
wish to tackle it later.
 
 You can leave the Reduce Chromatic Aberrations and Reduce 
Noise check boxes deselected and apply them after the HDR image 
is generated. This helps reduce needless processing until you 
determine whether the options are needed after reviewing the HDR 
image.
 
• Attempt to Reduce Ghosting Artifacts: Select this check box, and 
then select either the Background Movement or Moving Objects/

the HDR.

 Chapter 7: Generating HDR
People radio button. You may also choose a level for the detection 
algorithm from the Detection drop-down list to make sure you’re 
getting all movement erased.
 
• Take Tone Curve of Color Profile: This radio button is available 
only if you’re using images that have a tone curve, such as JPEGs 
or TIFFs. It isn’t active when you use Raw images (which are linear 
and have no tone curve). If this option is available, select it to use 
the tone curve of the color profile attached to the source images. 
Alternatively, select the Attempt to Reverse-Engineer Tone Curve 
Applied radio button.
 
 The following options are only 
visible if you are using Raw 
photos to generate the HDR 
image (see Figure 7-11 to see 
how the dialog box changes):
 
• Select an option from the 
White Balance drop-down 
list if needed. As Shot is 
the default and should 
be adequate. The list 
reveals common camera 
options such as Daylight, 
Cloudy, and Tungsten. 
If there were white bal-
ance problems in the 
original photos, you can 
attempt to correct that 
here or wait and correct 
it during tone mapping or 
even later. You may also 
choose to return in the 
process and convert the 
Raw files to 16-bit TIFFs 
and attempt to correct 
the problem in your Raw 
editor.
 
• Select a color profile from the Color Primaries HDR Based On drop-down 
list. You can choose sRGB, Adobe RGB, or ProPhoto RGB. sRGB is 
much more widely used, although it is the smallest color space and 
therefore not as true a representation of the actual colors than the 
other spaces. Adobe RGB has a wider range of colors than sRGB and 
is a popular color profile among photographers. ProPhoto RGB has 
the widest array of colors and will clip the least but is less prevalent 
and not as compatible across applications like Web browsers.
Figure 7-11: The Raw options in the Generate 
HDR – Options dialog box.

146
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
 
 You can choose a high-quality color profile (Adobe RGB or 
ProPhoto RGB) now without much concern for portability since 
you will probably continue to edit the image, even after tone 
mapping. If you won’t be doing any more editing before posting 
on the Web (that is, saving directly from Photomatix Pro as a 
JPEG), you should choose sRGB because it’s a more universal 
profile.
 
6. When you’re happy with your selections, click OK (Windows) or the 
Generate HDR button (Mac).
 
 Photomatix Pro churns and chugs as it generates your HDR file. Dialog 
boxes show you where it is in the process, depending on the options 
you chose. When it’s finished, it displays the HDR file for you to save 
(if you like), edit, and tone map.
 
7. (Optional) Save the HDR file for future use (choose File➪Save).
 
8. Select Radiance RGB from the File Format drop-down list, name your 
file, and click Save.
Photoshop
Photoshop creates HDR files, as you would expect, smoothly and profession-
ally. To generate HDR in Photoshop, follow these handy-dandy steps:
 
1. Launch Photoshop, and (optional) open the bracketed photos.
 
 You have the option of opening your bracketed images now — the 
ones that will be the source photos for creating HDR. You also have the 
option later to automatically select all open images to merge into HDR 
instead of navigating and selecting them yourself.
 
 If you have more images open than you want to merge, select photos 
that aren’t part of the same bracketed set, or some other irregular 
combination, you’re presented 
with an error message and 
asked to reconsider. Then 
Donald Trump will come in 
and fire you.
 
2. Choose File➪Automate➪
Merge to HDR.
 
 The Merge to HDR dialog box 
opens, as shown in Figure 7-12, 
pretty as you please. Add 
your source images using this 
dialog box.
Figure 7-12: Merging HDR traffic in Photoshop.

147
 Chapter 7: Generating HDR
 
3. Choose source images as follows:
 
• If the images are open: Click the Add Open Files button.
 
• If the image aren’t open: Choose Files from the Use drop-down list, 
and then click the Browse button. Navigate to the folder that con-
tains the bracketed photos and select them.
 
 If you add a photo you don’t want, select it after it appears in the 
Merge to HDR dialog box and then click the Remove button.
 
• To add all images from a folder: Choose Folder from the Use drop-
down list, and then click the Browse button. Navigate to the folder 
you want and select it.
 
 If you select Raw images in the Merge to HDR dialog box, Photoshop will 
apply the ACR default settings to process them. If you select files con-
verted previously by ACR and saved as TIFFs or JPEGs, you might see a 
warning about dynamic range. Click the Continue button.
 
4. (Optional) Select the Attempt to Automatically Align Source Images 
check box.
 
 This option helps align details in images and is especially helpful for 
hand-held brackets. If you shot your images using a tripod, you might 
not need to align source images. If you’re using brackets created from a 
single Raw photo, this isn’t necessary because there can be no misalign-
ment of the same photo. If in doubt, try it with the check box deselected, 
and look at the image at high magnification. If you see smeared details, 
ghosting from static objects, or what looks like a double-exposure, come 
back and select this check box.
 
5. Click OK to continue.
 
 Photoshop launches into a 
flurry of activity as it merges 
the files into an HDR image. If 
there is a question about the 
exposure values of the images, 
Photoshop displays the 
Manually Set EV dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 7-13. Enter the 
correct camera parameters in 
the Exposure Time, f-Stop, and 
ISO text boxes, or select EV 
and enter the value in the EV 
text box (useful for brackets from a single Raw exposure, but rather than 
relative EV differences, you take the provided absolute value and then 
add and subtract from that). Then click OK.
 
 When finished, the Merge to HDR dialog box reappears in a new form, as 
shown in Figure 7-14. A large preview window and the bracketed images 
appear on the left.

Figure 7-14: Previewing HDR in Photoshop.
 
6. Select the images you want to remove from the preview from the left 
side of the dialog box. Select them again to add them back.
 
 This allows you to change the balance of the HDR file toward under- or 
overexposure. You should be well served by trusting in your brackets, 
but experiment if the fancy strikes you.
 
7. Click the +/– buttons at the bottom of the dialog box to zoom in and 
out of the Merged Result image while you experiment with the source 
images and white point.
 
8. To retain the most flexibility, choose 32 Bit/Channel from the Bit 
Depth drop-down list.
 
 This allows you to save the resulting HDR file should you desire. If you 
set it to less (16 Bit/Channel or 8 Bit/Channel) and click OK, Photoshop 
automatically starts the HDR conversion process (Photoshop’s termi-
nology for tone mapping) and reduces the bit depth of the image. If you 
know what you want and don’t need to save the HDR file, selecting the 
bit depth saves time.
 
9. Drag the Set White Point Preview slider left or right to alter the 
image’s exposure.
 
 This is not a permanent change. You have the chance to review and 
finalize the image’s exposure during HDR conversion. This change 
shows up in the Exposure slider of the Exposure and Gamma method of 
the HDR Conversion dialog box.

10. (Optional) If desired, load a camera response curve from disk by 
selecting the Load From File radio button and clicking the button.
 
 You can also save the current camera response curve for use in later 
HDR projects by clicking the Save Response Curve As button. If you 
want to keep things absolutely consistent across a photo shoot, save the 
a camera response curve for the first set of images, and then load it for 
subsequent sets from the same shoot.
 
 Camera response curves map the relationship between the amount of 
light that hits the camera sensor and the digital value it stores in a given 
pixel. Photoshop apparently takes images that you feed into the “HDR 
machine” and constructs a response curve for each camera it identi-
fies. How often it does so and whether it updates every time is anyone’s 
guess. If you attempt to load a response curve saved from one camera 
to images generated from another, you receive a warning telling you 
exactly what cameras you have been using and the fact that using one 
for another might not be such a good idea.
 
11. Click OK to create the HDR file.
 
 You’re done. The HDR image opens in Photoshop. There is no obvious 
indication from the image itself that this is an HDR image and not an 
ordinary photo. However, if you look at the image title bar, Photoshop 
includes HDR in the name.
 
12. (Optional) Save the HDR image (choose File➪Save As).
 
 Photoshop supports many different HDR file types, including the stan-
dard Radiance RGBE and OpenEXR formats. You may also choose from 
any other 32-bits-per-channel format within Photoshop, such as TIFF 
or PSD. If you choose PDS, though, you might not be able to open these 
images in other HDR applications.
Photoshop Elements 8
With the release of Photoshop Elements 8, Elements has joined the ranks of 
HDR-aware applications. That’s the good news. The iffy news is that the HDR 
feature is not that powerful — it’s basically exposure blending with a little tone 
mapping thrown in. Nevertheless, you can do more in Elements 8 than in 7, and 
anything that accepts bracketed exposures isn’t all that bad in my book.
Regardless of what mode you want to use, you start out the same way:
 
1. Open the bracketed images.
 
 First you have to place the bracketed images in the Project Bin at 
the bottom of the screen. Do this by opening them (I’m not using the 
Elements Organizer). They can be Raw (in which case you’ll be pre-
sented with the Adobe Camera Raw interface), TIFF, or JPEG.

2. Select the images.
 
 Select from 2–10 images in the Project Bin. Ctrl+click (Windows) or 
Ô+click (Mac) to select non-adjacent images. Select the first, and then 
Shift+click the last if they are adjacent in the bin, as shown in Figure 7-15.
 
3. Choose File➪New➪Photomerge Exposure.
 
 This launches the HDR module and Photoshop Elements churns a bit 
while it prepares things.
At this point, you’re ready to choose between pursuing Automatic and 
Manual modes. You can switch back and forth between the two modes easily 
by selecting the tab with the appropriate name. In addition, you can click the 
Reset button to start over, the Done button to finish and apply the settings, 
or the Cancel button to abort the process.

E
verything else in HDR either leads up to or follows tone mapping (a truism 
of the finest caliber). Or, to put it another way, tone mapping is where 
HDR turns from promise to practice. All the photographs, brackets, metering, 
converting, and trudging around with your camera and tripod have brought 
you to the point where you’re ready to turn your HDR image right back 
into a low dynamic range image. With HDR photography, how-
ever, you’re in charge. It’s a circle-of-life kind of thing.
And to be successful at tone mapping, you need to 
speak the language. This chapter, therefore, contin-
ues that process. You’ll read about tone mapping 
in general but also delve into specific tone map-
ping features found in two of the leading applica-
tions in the HDR community: Photomatix Pro and 
Photoshop. With this information at hand, you’ll 
be ready to tackle tone mapping in earnest with a 
greater possibility of creating fantastic images.
Tone Mapping 101
Tone mapping occurs when you convert a higher dynamic range 
image to one with a lower dynamic range, most often a JPEG or TIFF. The 
HDR image is, of course, created from bracketed photos with a wide range of 
exposures.

152
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
One aspect of the tone mapping process is illustrated by Figure 8-1: namely, 
squeezing dynamic range. This is important because monitors, printers, 
and standard graphics files are incompatible with HDR images. The large 
dynamic range of the HDR image (taken just outside a large building with 
a very large portico) is mapped into the lower dynamic range during tone 
mapping (which you perform after you create the HDR image in your HDR 
application). Notice that the EV range of the HDR image ranges from below –6 
to above +9 EV, which is well beyond the capabilities of an 8- or 16-bit image. 
Tone mapping allows you to see something like the original dynamic range of 
the image, using a less-capable format. Aside from all the technical mumbo 
jumbo, without tone mapping, there is no point to HDR photography. This is 
where you decide, based on the information available in the high bit-depth 
HDR image, what the final low dynamic range image looks like. And that is the 
point — creating a final image you can continue to edit, post on the Web, and 
print to hang on your refrigerator.
 
When monitors, printers, and computers work with 32-bit HDR images — like 
JPEGs — tone mapping might shrink in importance because there will be no 
need to tone map an HDR image to a low dynamic range space — it’ll be com-
patible with everything as originally shot.
And that’s not all that happens when you tone map.
Given a bracketed set of images, if you examine two points and compare their 
brightness (luminance), they have a distinct relationship with each other, as 
shown in Figure 8-2. In this case, the spot on the building is darker than the 
clouds. No matter what image of the bracketed set you look at, the two points 
have the same relationship to each other in terms of luminance. Although the 
contrast between them diminishes as either point gets blown out or lost in 
shadow, the basic relationship stays the same. To reiterate, in this bracketed 
set, a point in the shadowed area of the building is always darker than the 
clouds, regardless of the bracket you look at.
Tone mapping breaks this relationship. As you tone map the HDR image, you 
don’t have to keep the same brightness relationship between the two points. 
You can alter and even reverse it so that the darker point becomes the 
lighter point. In fact, this is exactly what happened. In the tone mapped file, 
the same spot in shadow on the building is slightly lighter than the clouds!
 
This is why tone mapping is different than blending exposures and other 
techniques that simply compress the larger dynamic range into a smaller 
space. Tone mapping allows you to take the high dynamic range data and 
change the brightness relationship between different points of the image. 
This is where your photographer’s judgment and artistry come into play.

Figure 8-3 shows the final tone mapped image. Irrespective of all the techni-
cal processes going on in the HDR application, I wanted to create an aestheti-
cally pleasing finished image, which meant fiddling with the tone mapping 
settings in Photomatix Pro until I was satisfied. The wealth of exposure data 
provided by the bracketed photos gives you the flexibility to accomplish the 
same thing with your HDR images.

the process of tone mapping.

Getting Acquainted with Photomatix Pro
To effectively use any HDR application, you must know what the controls do. 
They are the interface between you, the mathematical algorithms that define 
tone mapping, and the image. With this knowledge, you can consciously guide 
the image where you want it to go. That beats randomly moving sliders any day.
Photomatix Pro is a nifty program. It’s very popu-
lar because it produces great images. Beyond 
that, the controls make sense, are easy to use, 
and the program is packaged nicely with a few 
alternate modes (Exposure Fusion and the Tone 
Compressor) besides the traditional tone map-
ping method, the Details Enhancer. Navigate to 
www.hdrsoft.com to download the trial (Mac 
and Windows). You can purchase it for around 
$100, depending on the package you get. Figure 
8-4 shows the shortcuts you can click to jump into 
Photomatix Pro. This dialog box pops up automati-
cally when you open Photomatix, or you can bring 
it up by choosing View➪Show Workflow Shortcuts.
Here’s a quick overview of the shortcuts shown:
 
✓ Generate HDR Image: I cover this in 
Chapter 7.
 
✓ Tone Mapping: This option leads to two dif-
ferent tone mapping methods:
 
• Details Enhancer: This is the classic 
HDR tone mapping method, which you 
use for a distinctive HDR look (although 
very realistic results are also possible).
 
• Tone Compressor: An alternative tone mapping method, Tone 
Compressor produces generally more realistic results than Details 
Enhancer and is somewhat simpler to use.
 
✓ Exposure Fusion: Blends light and dark areas from different exposures; 
produces even more realistic results with less noise; is simpler and has 
fewer steps than either tone mapping method.
 
✓ Batch Processing: Use to automatically process a bracketed set or mul-
tiple sets with the same settings; a magnificent time-saver.
 
✓ Batch Single Files: Use to automatically process saved HDR files and 
single Raw images; another wonderful time-saver.
 
✓ Tutorial: The tutorial is a small Web presentation with a handful of 
pages with basic information. It’s a handy guide to get started using 
Photomatix Pro.

in Photomatix Pro.

Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
 
To get to Details Enhancer or Tone Compressor, start by clicking Tone 
Mapping. This is the route you’ll use the most in HDR.
Exploring Details Enhancer
Details Enhancer is where you’ll spend most of your time in Photomatix Pro to 
tone map your HDR images. As you can see from Figure 8-5, there are a number 
of controls. Thankfully, they are well organized into functional areas. The three 
floating windows in Figure 8-5 show the settings, image preview, and histogram.
The following sections cover the tone mapping settings available in Details 
Enhancer.
Figure 8-5: Details Enhancer.
General controls
The first section, as shown in Figure 8-6, contains the general controls, which 
are accessible no matter what other section of the dialog box is expanded.

157
 Chapter 8: Preparing to Tone Map
 
This section and the following sec-
tions have a number of what I call 
“mini-max” images that show the set-
tings in the extreme. They are all the 
same bracketed HDR image of a 
Harley-Davidson motorcycle, tone 
mapped to show the minimum and 
maximum values of one setting at a 
time. The other settings are at their 
default. No attempt was made to 
make the images look finished. The 
goal is to show you what each setting 
does by isolating its effect.
 
✓ Strength: This setting controls 
contrast enhancement strength, 
both local and global. Although 
it’s not technically the strength 
of the overall tone mapping 
effect, it acts like it. The default 
value is 70. For a more dramatic 
effect, raise Strength toward 
100. Conversely, to create a 
more realistic effect, lower 
strength to 50 or lower.
 
 Quite often, lowering Strength 
lightens an image, and raising it 
darkens the image. Lower values 
produce a more realistic effect. 
High values, between 80 and 100, 
look great and don’t have to look 
unrealistic if other settings aren’t 
underdone (primarily smoothing). More on smoothing in a bit.
Loupe-d loupe
Photomatix has a tool that isn’t critical to the 
process of tone mapping, but is nonetheless 
cool. It’s called the Loupe, and it enlarges a 
square portion of your image so you can get a 
really good close-up look at what you’re doing. 
Click where you want to magnify in the tone 
mapping preview window to open the Loupe 
and drag its marquee around in the preview 
window to move to different areas.
Figure 8-6: General controls with default 
settings.

158
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
 
 Figure 8-7 illustrates the minimum (left) and maximum (right) settings. 
Notice that the minimum value results in a more realistic, less-con-
trasted image, and the stronger setting really pumps up the drama (in 
this case, at the cost of some haloing).
 
✓ Color Saturation: This setting controls color strength or intensity. The 
default is, oddly enough, 46. Raise for more intense color; lower for more 
subdued color. Reduce to 0 for a grayscale image.
 
 Color that’s too intense can look garish (which looks great with a nice 
meal — or is that garnish?) and raise the noise level of the image. Values 
between 60 and 80 result in nice, strong color. If your colors are already 
muted, bumping up to 100 can help make the colors appear more normal.
 
 You might be tempted to use the Color Saturation control to create 
a black-and-white image, but I wouldn’t recommend this approach 
because you have no control over the black and white tonality. Chapter 
13 shows other methods that give you more control over the process. 
The strongly saturated image looks pretty good.
 
✓ Luminosity: Affects overall brightness by adjusting tonal compression of 
the image. It helps to think of Luminosity, in part, as a shadow brightness 
control. Raising it brightens shadows, and lowering it darkens shadows.
 
 Contrast is also affected when you change the Luminosity setting. 
Higher Luminosity values lower contrast, and lower values have the 
effect of increasing contrast.
 
 The default is 0. Raising Luminosity sometimes has the effect of bringing 
out more details from clouds that are on the verge of blowing out.
 
✓ Microcontrast: Accentuates local contrast.
 
 Higher settings amplify local contrast and also have the effect of darken-
ing the image. Lower values reduce local contrast and have the effect of 
lightening the image. The default is 0. Higher settings can increase the 
drama of the image.
Strength=0
Strength=100

 Chapter 8: Preparing to Tone Map
 
✓ Smoothing: Controls the level that contrast enhancements are 
smoothed out. This setting plays the largest role in determining how 
the tone mapped image looks, and is responsible for much of the debate 
over style and aesthetics. Smoothing comes in two modes:
 
• Slider mode: Control smoothing with a free-ranging slider. Higher 
values produce more smoothing while lower values result in less. 
Pay attention to the light 
balance across the image 
as you consider different 
strengths. The default is 0.
 
• Light mode: Select the Light 
Mode check box to see 
discrete buttons that con-
trol smoothing strength, 
as shown in Figure 8-8. 
Options are Min, Low, Mid, 
High, and Max.
 
 As shown in Figure 8-9, lower settings produce a much less realis-
tic image, complete with halos between areas of different contrast, 
because they are not smoothed, or blended, together. Min and Max 
produce more realistic results.
 
 Each smoothing mode has its own unique algorithm. It helps to think of 
slider mode as a fine-tuning range above Max in light mode. Generally, 
all slider mode settings produce a smoother image than light mode.
Light Smoothing=Min
Light Smoothing=Max
Figure 8-9: The range of Light Smoothing.
Tone settings
The next section of the Details Enhancer dialog box contains the Tone set-
tings, as shown in Figure 8-10. If it isn’t visible, click the arrow beside the 
name and it will expand. This section has basic tone controls.

Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
 
✓ White Point: Sets the white 
point, or maximum luminos-
ity, of the tone mapped image 
(think high end of dynamic 
range). Higher settings produce 
more contrast and a brighter 
image. Lower settings do the 
opposite. The default is 0.25%.
 
 Pay attention to the image and 
histogram as you make White 
Point changes so you don’t 
blow out highlights.
 
 Figure 8-11 shows both ends of the spectrum. At 0%, White Point doesn’t 
do much of anything. Notice the blown highlights at the maximum level.
 
✓ Black Point: Sets the black point, or minimum luminosity, of the tone 
mapped image (think low end of dynamic range). Higher settings result 
in a darker, more contrasted image. Lower settings do the opposite. The 
default is 0%.
 
 Pay attention to the image and histogram as you make Black Point 
changes so you don’t lose details in shadows.
 
 Like with White Point, 0% does nothing. Raising Black Point to its maxi-
mum level deepens the darker tones in the image.
 
✓ Gamma: Sets the mid-point of the tone mapped image. Higher settings 
lighten the image and lower settings darken it. Each pixel isn’t lightened 
or darkened by the same amount, however. You’re moving the bright-
ness mid-point around, which has the effect of squeezing or expanding 
highlights or shadows into a smaller or larger space on the histogram. In 
general, you shouldn’t have to mess with Gamma.
White Point=0%
White Point=Max %

 Chapter 8: Preparing to Tone Map
Color settings
The next section contains Color set-
tings, as shown in Figure 8-12. Here 
are the controls for the image’s color 
temperature and saturation controls 
for shadows and highlights.
 
✓ Temperature: The Temperature 
control lets you change the color 
temperature of the tone mapped 
image. Moving the slider right 
produces a reddish cast while 
moving the slider to the left results in a blue feeling. The default is 0. 
Figure 8-13 illustrates the visual result of moving the Temperature control 
from its minimum to maximum.
 
 If you work in Raw, consider correcting color temperature problems 
when you convert the Raw files to TIFF for HDR. If you use JPEGs, you 
can correct the problem here. If there are color cast problems in certain 
areas of the image, wait until post-HDR processing, where you can apply 
masks or otherwise selectively alter the image’s temperature.
 
✓ Saturation Highlights: The color strength within the highlights of the 
tone mapped image. Raise to intensify the colors in brighter parts of the 
image. Lower to reduce them. The default is 0.
 
 I often use this control as a tool to investigate the tonal regions of the 
image. Lower to minimum; then raise to maximum to see where the high-
lights are. You can also create different artistic effects.
 
✓ Saturation Shadows: The same as Saturation Highlights, except for the 
darker areas of the image. The default is 0.
 
 Experiment with the Saturation Highlights and Saturation Shadows con-
trols in relation to the overall Color Saturation control. For example, set-
ting Saturation Highlights to 100 and lowering the overall Color Saturation 
to 0 results in colored highlights and the rest of the image in grayscale.
Temperature=-10.0
Temperature=+10.0

Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Miscellaneous settings
Miscellaneous settings, as shown in Figure 8-14, is the final section with tone 
mapping settings. These are related to smoothing and clipping.
 
✓ Micro-smoothing: Smoothes 
details in the tone mapped 
image. The default value is 2.0.
 
 As shown in Figure 8-15, higher 
settings result in a lighter, more 
realistic appearance and can 
also reduce image noise. Lower 
settings perform very little or 
no smoothing.
 
✓ Highlights Smoothness: 
Smoothes highlights, leaving the 
darker parts of the image alone. 
The default is 0. Higher values 
tend to lighten the image. Use 
Highlights Smoothness to blend 
areas where highlights and shadows meet.
 
✓ Shadows Smoothness: Smoothes shadows, leaving the brighter parts of 
the image alone. The default is 0. Higher values also darken the image. 
Use Shadows Smoothness to blend the border where highlights and 
shadows meet.
 
 Neither Shadows Smoothness nor Highlights Smoothness controls are 
panaceas, but they have a good effect if properly used.
 
✓ Shadows Clipping: Sets the dark point where shadows are clipped 
(thrown away). The default is 0. Raising this control can help fight noise 
in very dark areas by clipping them, which removes them from the tone 
mapped image.
 
 Figure 8-16 shows Shadows Clipping at 0 (the default) and at 100, which 
shows you the effect very clearly.
Figure 8-14: Miscellaneous controls with 
defaults loaded.
What’s your color temperature?
Color temperature is a strange thing. The 
color of the light a light source (say, a light 
bulb in your kitchen) emits reveals tem-
perature (measured in degrees Kelvin). Hotter 
color temperatures are blue, and cooler color 
temperatures are red. It gets tricky because we 
tend to assign values to blue and red that are 
the opposite. We say a warmer color is red and 
a cooler color is blue, which completely contra-
dicts their actual temperature.

163
 Chapter 8: Preparing to Tone Map
 
✓ 360 Image: If you’re shooting a 360-degree panorama, selecting this 
check box ensures that the left and right borders of an image are tone 
mapped in relation to each other, eliminating differences between the 
two ends (which, in reality, are together) that result in an obvious seam.

Figure 8-16: Not clipping versus clipping shadows.
Examining Tone Compressor
Tone Compressor, as shown in Figure 8-17, is another way to tone map an 
HDR image in Photomatix Pro. As the name suggests, dark and light tones 
on the extremes of the histogram are compressed toward the middle. In this 
case, the result is a very clean, realistic image of a lamppost over a river at 
sunset. The blue sky is simply gorgeous.
The controls in Tone Compressor are much simpler than Details Enhancer:
 
✓ Brightness: ’Zactly what it says. Brightness. The default is 0. Raise it or 
lower it to change the brightness of the image.
 
✓ Tonal Range Compression: Controls how much to squeeze the low and 
high ends of the histogram toward the middle. The default is 0.

164
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
 
✓ Contrast Adaptation: This control works a little bit like Vibrancy or 
Saturation. The default is 0. Raise it to make colors more intense; lower it 
to mute them. Of course, you’re changing contrast at the same time. Higher 
values appear less contrasted, and lower values have more contrast.
 
✓ And the rest (sung to the theme song of Gilligan’s Island): White 
Point, Black Point, Color Temperature, and Color Saturation are the 
same controls as found in the Details Enhancer method.

 Chapter 8: Preparing to Tone Map
Exposure fusing in Photomatix Pro
Photomatix Pro also has a nifty tool called 
Exposure Fusion (formerly known as Exposure 
Blending). Use it by selecting Exposure Fusion 
from the Workflow Shortcuts dialog box (as 
seen on TV and in Figure 8-4). It isn’t HDR, but 
it does use brackets to blend the photos of a 
bracketed set. The results are very realistic 
and have less noise than tone mapped images. 
Select brackets just like you would while tone 
mapping.
Here are the ways to fuse exposures in 
Photomatix Pro:
 ✓ Average: No options. See what it looks like. 
If you like it, great. If not, move on.
 ✓ Highlights & Shadows — Auto: Ditto.
 ✓ Highlights & Shadows — Adjust: You have 
more options to control the process here, 
ranging from Accentuation, Blending Point, 
and Shadows, to Midtone.
 ✓ Highlights & Shadows – 2 images: Pick and 
choose two images from the bracketed set 
you want to fuse together. Aside from that, 
there are no options.
 ✓ Highlights & Shadows – Intensive: This is 
the most intensive Exposure Fusing method. 
Or mode. Or whatever. There are a few con-
trols to play around with: Strength, Color 
Saturation, and Radius. This is also the most 
demanding process for your computer.
Just for kicks, try creating a multiple exposure 
look using Exposure Fusion. Choose two or 
more different source images with the same 
size in pixels and load them into Exposure 
Fusion. Experiment with different methods until 
you find the least objectionable!

166
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Using Photoshop
Tone mapping options are much more limited in Adobe Photoshop — and 
I’m not talking Elements, where tone mapping options are nonexistent. I find 
that in Photoshop CS3 and CS4, the aim is generally to present a much more 
realistic result.
Creating an HDR image in Photoshop is covered in Chapter 7 and tone map-
ping steps are covered in Chapter 9.
With a 32 bit per channel HDR image loaded in Photoshop, you can find the 
four tone mapping methods by choosing Image➪Mode➪8Bits/Channel or 
16Bits/Channel. This opens the HDR Conversion dialog box (you see the dif-
ferent options in the following figures). The four methods are
 
✓ Exposure and Gamma: This is a fancy name for brightness (exposure) 
and contrast (gamma). You are in control of the sliders and can choose 
whatever values look good to you.
 
 Figure 8-18 shows the Exposure and Gamma options in the HDR 
Conversion dialog box that you can use to work on an HDR image. You 
can see from the photo that this is a very realistic result. The histogram 
indicates there are not very many highlights, however.
Figure 8-18: The Exposure and Gamma options.

167
 Chapter 8: Preparing to Tone Map
 
✓ Highlight Compression: Similar to Tone Compressor in Photomatix Pro, 
but Highlight Compression (so far as that’s its name) squeezes high-
lights in a 32-bit/channel HDR image down to where they don’t clip in a 
16-bit or 8-bit/channel low dynamic range image. There are no controls 
for this method. Choose it from the Method drop-down list to use it.
 
 Figure 8-19 illustrates the HDR Conversion dialog box with the Highlight 
Compression option selected, and the result on an HDR image. This 
image would require a lot of work to make it look presentable — the tree 
is far too dark.
 
✓ Equalize Histogram: This tool is also similar to the Tone Compressor 
in Photomatix Pro. Equalize Histogram squeezes the entire dynamic 
range of the HDR image into the low dynamic range image space while 
trying to retain an appropriate contrast level. There are no controls for 
this method. Choose it from the Method drop-down list (everyone say it 
now) to use it.
 
 Figure 8-20 shows the Equalize Histogram option selected and the effect. 
Not bad, although in this case, it looks a little posterized.
Figure 8-19: Using Highlight Compression.

Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Figure 8-20: Equalizing the histogram.
 
✓ Local Adaptation: This is the squirrelly one, but it’s also the method that 
can create more artistic results. The Local Adaptation is selected in Figure 
8-21. The two controls are Radius and Threshold sliders (shown at their 
default values), and you can use the histogram to apply a toning curve.
 
 Notice that a tone curve has been applied to the histogram (click the 
arrows by the Toning Curve and Histogram label if you don’t see this 
area) to control the image’s overall brightness and contrast. Bring in the 
end points of the histogram and alter contrast by changing the curve. 
Although you can see it in every method, you can edit only when you 
use the Local Adaptation method.
 
 The point of Local Adaptation is to alter local contrast. The settings 
operate like this:
 
• Radius: Radius acts like a local contrast control. Turning it up 
emphasizes local contrast, and turning it down reduces local con-
trast. Use Radius to control the overall strength of the tone map-
ping effect.

169
 Chapter 8: Preparing to Tone Map
 
 Figure 8-22 shows the minimum and maximum values for Radius, 
while Threshold stays at the default. To see where the difference is 
largest, look at the leaves and the bright area on the wall. They are 
much brighter when Radius is at maximum.
 
• Threshold: Threshold acts like a smoothing control. Increasing it 
smoothes the effects of increased local contrast. Use Threshold to 
smooth differences between light and dark areas.
 
 Figure 8-23 illustrates minimum and maximum values for 
Threshold. Radius is at the default value. Here, the difference 
is dramatic. With Threshold at minimum, the image is very 
smoothed — almost blurred. At maximum, there are obvious 
halos that detract from the image.
 
 Reduce the Radius and/or Threshold if you’re having problems 
with halos.

E
arlier chapters lay a broad yet detailed foundation of knowledge about 
high dynamic range digital photography strong enough for you to begin 
tone mapping. This chapter takes you through the process of tone map-
ping using two of the leading HDR applications, Photomatix Pro 
and Photoshop, using their respective Details Enhancer and 
the HDR Conversion routines. I also show you how to use 
Photoshop Elements 8 to tone map an HDR image.
Following that, you find tips and techniques on how 
to get the best images out of Photomatix, and how to 
batch-process brackets or single files automatically.
Tone Mapping with Photomatix Pro
It’s time to get down to the practical matter of tone 
mapping an HDR image in Photomatix Pro. If you need 
additional clarification on the meaning of the settings, 
see Chapter 7.
 
You don’t have to perfect an image in tone mapping. You can con-
tinue to edit in your graphics application.

174
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Getting ready to tone map
Before you can tone map, you must complete the photography and have 
your bracketed (or single Raw) images ready. Here’s a checklist to make sure 
everything is in order:
 
✓ Photos taken: Check. Have two or more bracketed photos ready, shot 
as described in Chapters 4 and 5. Alternatively, you can use a single Raw 
photo for single-exposure HDR.
 
✓ Raw images converted to TIFF, if desired: Roger. As covered in Chapter 
7, you might wish to convert Raw photos to TIFFs to get the best quality. 
Single Raw exposures can either be used directly for HDR (pseudo-HDR) 
or converted to brackets in a Raw editor. Chapter 7 has more detailed 
information on converting Raw images.
 
✓ HDR image generated: Affirmative. The low dynamic range source 
images must be combined to create a single high dynamic range (HDR) 
image, as shown in Chapter 7.
Looks like you’re ready to get started!
Getting started to tone map
If your seat is in its upright and locked position, with tray table stored, you 
can get started. Launch Photomatix Pro and generate HDR on the fly or load 
a saved HDR image (see Chapter 7). If you need to brush up on what each set-
ting does, please consult Chapter 8.
Using presets every time you tone map
No matter what HDR application you use, pre-
sets are worth your time and trouble to use. 
In general, presets allow you to manage your 
tone mapping process by making it possible for 
you to create and use your own tone mapping 
styles, baselines, or starting points in the form of 
self-created presets. Load one or more presets 
that may apply to the image at hand and use the 
best one as a starting point to start tweaking.
Save a settings file or preset every time you 
tone map an image and file them so that you 
can find them if needed. I keep mine with the 
unedited tone mapped file in a folder with the 
pre- and post-HDR working files for that brack-
eted set.
Saving a preset for each tone mapped image 
that you have finished allows you to duplicate 
your work if you need to. Without a preset, 
should you want to go back and start over, 
you’re left guessing what settings you used to 
create an image. That is most definitely infuriat-
ing, especially if you want to tweak around the 
edges instead of starting from scratch.

175
 Chapter 9: Tone Mapping for Fun and Profit
With the HDR image ready and 
onscreen in Photomatix Pro, com-
plete the following steps to tone 
map it:
 
1. Invoke the tone mapping 
process by clicking the Tone 
Mapping button (see Figure 9-1) 
or by choosing Process➪Tone 
Mapping.
 
 This launches the Details 
Enhancer, as shown in Figure 9-2. 
You can switch tabs between 
the Details Enhancer and Tone 
Compressor at any time.
 
2. Load baseline settings by 
choosing a preset option from 
the Presets drop-down list, or 
by adjusting the settings in the 
Details Enhancer by hand.
 
 Each time you load an image 
to tone map, reset the controls 
manually (which takes time) or 
with the help of a preset that 
you created beforehand. The 
purpose of this step is to create 
a fairly neutral starting point for 
all your photos.
 
 If you choose the preset route, 
select Default from the Presets 
drop-down list (seen near the 
bottom of the Details Enhancer 
window). Or create a preset 
of your own to load when you 
need by selecting Save Settings 
from the Presets menu (your 
current settings are saved with 
the filename of your choice). My 
preferred settings deviate from the default in Strength, Color Saturation, 
White Point, and Black Point. In each of these instances, I prefer higher 
values to start with.
Figure 9-1: Starting to tone map.

3. Analyze the image.
 
 Look at the effect your baseline settings have on the HDR image, as 
shown in Figure 9-3. Sometimes what you see is good; sometimes bad, 
and sometimes in between.
 
 Don’t expect it to be perfect. The point is to use this as a starting point. 
If you have other baselines for different conditions or artistic effects 
(interiors, exteriors, strong, realistic, and so on), load them and see 
what they look like. Sometimes you will be surprised.
Examine your reaction and use that as an indicator as to where the image 
could be changed. Think in terms of these characteristics:
 
✓ Overall brightness: Is the image too bright, too dark, or just right? Use 
the histogram to see a graph of where the pixels are distributed in the 
image, from dark to light. Figure 9-4 illustrates an area of the image that 
is very bright, and even needs to be toned down some.
 
✓ Light balance: Sometimes certain areas of the image are too dark or too 
light. Compare adjacent areas that have different balances of brightness 
and tone. Figure 9-5 shows three such areas. Pay attention to tonal dif-
ferences where they meet, such as between the floor and counter (high 
contrast but uniform), the ceiling and decor (close in contrast), and the 
upper floor structural area (smaller areas with differing contrasts).

177
 Chapter 9: Tone Mapping for Fun and Profit
Figure 9-3: Preview the baseline settings.
 
 Come up with solutions rather 
than simply observe. The coun-
ter should be more vibrant com-
pared with the floor; the mural 
should have more contrast than 
the wall; the lights in the upper 
areas are too bright. These 
things should be corrected.
 
✓ Image contrast: Does the image 
look like a light gray overlay is 
on top of it, as in Figure 9-6? If 
so, there is not enough image 
contrast. In this case, the floor 
and stone table reveal that there 
isn’t enough overall contrast in 
the image.
 
✓ Details: Are the details visible 
enough? Do they pop? Details can be accentuated or smoothed by 
adjusting local contrast settings. Part of the mural is shown in Figure 9-7. 
It looks bright enough, but there could be much better contrast.
Figure 9-4: Try to keep from blowing out areas.

178
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Figure 9-5: Analyze different areas and decide what to do about them.
 
✓ Noise: What is the noise level? Is it accept-
able, or has it been accentuated? Figure 9-8 
illustrates a good place to find noise: areas 
of fairly consistent color and texture. It’s 
easy to spot some noise here — nothing 
drastic, but you might want to take care of 
this later, after tone mapping.
 
✓ Color intensity: Does the image need more 
color or less color? Is this need confined to 
highlights, shadows, or the entire image? 
Figure 9-9 shows another side of the mural 
against one end of the main lobby. The 
colors look nice and saturated, but enhanc-
ing contrast will show them off better.
 
✓ Temperature: Does the image have a blue or 
reddish color cast to it? If so, this indicates 
a color temperature problem. Figure 9-10 
indicates pretty good temperature in this 
image. The floor looks gray, the white panels 
look white, and the black computer monitor 
looks black.
Making and evaluating 
adjustments
 
As you tone map, take the controls and move 
them one way or another. Go to the extremes so 
you can see the full effect of the control. You’ll quickly see which ones do 
what and whether you like the effect. Although you can make adjustments 
in any order, I find approaching things in a regular, methodical way helps to 
Figure 9-6: Image contrast is 
lacking.
Figure 9-7: Details need more 
pop.

179
 Chapter 9: Tone Mapping for Fun and Profit
achieve consistent results. You also avoid setting 
different controls to have the opposite effect, 
which makes it very hard to discern what’s hap-
pening while you tone map the image.
In the following sections, you’ll notice that some 
controls are repeated. This is because effects are 
often interdependent. After making an adjustment 
in one area, go back and review other important 
settings. Refer to Figure 9-3 to compare each 
change with the baseline.
 
Throughout the course of adjusting each setting, 
constantly evaluate the image. At any time, you 
can choose elect Save Settings from the Presets 
list and save the current tone mapping settings in 
a file that can be stored and accessed later. Name 
it something that makes sense so you can recall 
what it is or why you saved it. You can also com-
pare the effect of the tone mapping settings to 
the original image by selecting Show Original on 
the Tone Mapping Preview window.
Adjust brightness and contrast
To adjust your image’s brightness and contrast, 
you use the White Point, Black Point, Luminosity, 
Gamma, and Strength settings. At this point, 
you’re just getting the image into the ballpark 
and making it possible for you to see where you 
need to make other changes. Try to keep from 
blowing out highlights. You’ll have plenty of time 
to finalize brightness and contrast by the time 
you’re done.
 
Control the overall lightness of the image by 
raising or lowering the White Point, the Black 
Point, or Luminosity. White Point and Black Point 
have strong effects on brightness and contrast. 
Luminosity acts as a shadow control — raising or 
lowing the brightness in darker regions.
In the example I use in this chapter, the image is 
sufficiently bright. The problem is a bit too much 
brightness around the front door, in reflections 
Figure 9-8: Noise is a common 
problem with HDR.
Figure 9-9: Colors add pop and 
zing if not overdone.
Figure 9-10: Check the image’s 
temperature.

180
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
off the floor, and the interior light-
ing. This is corrected by lowering the 
White Point to bring the reflections 
on the floor and other hot spots 
under control, raising the Black Point 
to restore contrast, and then raising 
the Luminosity to lighten the image.
There is a definite balancing act as 
you change settings. The amount 
you choose to change settings has 
a tremendous impact on the overall 
appearance of the image. You may 
push things very hard for an artistic 
look or nudge things very carefully for 
a more realistic effect. It’s your call!
 
Use Gamma as a last resort to con-
trol lightness. Raising Gamma tends 
to reduce contrast too much, result-
ing in a washed-out look. Lowering 
it darkens the image and raises con-
trast. Strength also affects contrast. 
If needed, return to Strength and 
readjust.
Fix the light balance and 
the overall effect
To adjust the light balance and 
overall effect in your image, use the 
Strength and Smoothing settings.
If your baseline settings have been 
dialed in to the point that you’re 
happy with how your image looks, 
you might not have to make any sig-
nificant adjustments to the Strength 
and Smoothing settings. If that is the 
case, tweak around the edges to see 
whether you can improve each particular image. For images that don’t look 
right, it will be obvious. In these situations, adjust Smoothing first, and then 
take care of the Strength.
–10.0
0.0
+10.0
Figure 9-11: Smoothing plays a major role in 
light balance.

181
 Chapter 9: Tone Mapping for Fun and Profit
You can easily get carried away with the “HDR effect” and make poor smooth-
ing choices (mostly not enough). Alternate between using the Smoothing 
slider and selecting the Light Mode check box to compare the results you get 
from each mode.
Figure 9-11 shows three smoothing strengths: –10.0, 0.0, and +10.0. Each has 
a different effect on the light balance of the image. Look carefully at the floor 
versus the low stone walls on the sides. Different settings put them in differ-
ent balance with each other.
From minimum to maximum, the balance is reversed. With Smoothing set 
to –10.0, the floor is dark, and the walls are light. As Smoothing increases, 
they come into a more even balance. By the time Smoothing is at +10.0, they 
have switched. The floor is light, and the walls are dark. As an aesthetic deci-
sion, I choose bright stone walls to emphasize their detail and a darker floor.
Adjust and enhance the color
To adjust and enhance the color in your image, you use the Color Saturation, 
Saturation Highlights, Saturation Shadows, and 
Temperature settings.
Make color adjustments to suit your taste. You 
might not need to alter these controls if your 
baseline settings can be suitably applied to most 
images. If necessary, start color adjustments 
with Color Saturation to control the overall inten-
sity of the image. Use Saturation Highlights and 
Saturation Shadows for special effects or to solve 
problems in those particular tonal regions.
Figure 9-12 is, in fact, a rejected alternative. Even 
if you trust your baseline settings, fiddle with 
them to make sure they look good. In this case, 
Color Saturation is lowered to 60 (from 80) to see 
whether the image would look better without as 
much color intensity. These are the subjective 
decisions you make while you tone map. I prefer 
the stronger colors for this image, which can be 
seen better in the small crop of a colorful area of 
the wall.
Think details
To tweak the details in your image, you use the 
Microcontrast and Luminosity settings.
60
80
Figure 9-12: Always explore 
alternative settings — this time, 
decreased saturation.

182
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
 
Microcontrast is the go-to control for local contrast because it accentuates 
details. You’ll find that Luminosity sometimes needs readjusted after making 
a strong Microcontrast change. Adjust both until you find the right balance. 
A strong surge in Microcontrast has the effect of heightening the drama and 
intensity of an image. If it gets too dark, raise Luminosity to compensate. 
If necessary, return to White Point or Black Point (which was lowered) to 
adjust those settings.
Smoothness changes (covered in the next section) reduce local contrast and 
smooth over details. Consider how you approach the image to avoid setting 
controls contrary to one another.
Control smoothness
To control the smoothness in your photos, you use the Micro-smoothing, 
Highlights Smoothness, Shadows Smoothness, and Shadows Clipping set-
tings. You might need to increase smoothness to combat noise or to lower 
local contrast and smooth out details. Micro-smoothing works globally, and 
Highlights Smoothness and Shadows Smoothness affects only those tonal 
areas. Smoothing also has an effect on how smoothly light and dark areas 
transition to each other.
 
Smoothing is great, but pay attention to contrast. Small amounts of smooth-
ing go a long way. By increasing the Smoothing level, you can raise the real-
ism, smooth out some noise, smooth out the light a little, and moderate the 
contrast of the image. As a whole, Smoothing helps cement things together.
Shadows Clipping can often be ignored, but if you have problems with noise 
in dark areas, raising it can clip it from the image. This setting also has an 
effect on contrast.
Finishing up
When you’re happy with the results, it’s time to process and save:
 
1. Click the Process button in the Details Enhancer.
 
 This applies the tone mapping settings to the HDR image and creates a 
low dynamic range image for you to save.
 
 You’ll see a progress dialog box. If you’re like me, you love watching 
progress bars.
 
2. Choose File➪Save As.
 
 This calls up the Save As (Windows)/Save (Mac) dialog box. The things 
you want to note are Save As Type (Windows)/File Format (Mac), and the 
Open Saved Image(s) With check box, as explained in the following list:

183
 Chapter 9: Tone Mapping for Fun and Profit
 
• File Name (Windows)/Save As (Mac): A name is generated for you 
based on the original images in the bracket or HDR filename with 
_tonemapped appended. Change as desired.
 
• Save As Type (Windows)/File Format (Mac): Choose 16-bit TIFF for 
the highest quality (and largest file size), 8-bit TIFF for high quality, 
and JPEG for the lowest quality (and smallest size).
 
 If you’re a quality junkie, don’t choose anything but 16-bit TIFF. 
In reality, the difference between 16-bit and 8-bit TIFF is not that 
apparent. 8-bit TIFF is a reasonable compromise and will work in 
image editors that balk at 16-bit images. Choose JPEG only if you 
don’t want to perform further editing.
 
 JPEG is also a great format with which to compare the effects of 
different tone mapping settings on the same HDR image. Process 
them separately and save each as a JPEG. This makes the files 
smaller; they also load much faster if you want to switch back and 
forth to compare.
 
• Save Tone Mapping Settings (Windows only): Leave this check box 
selected. You’ll have a permanent record of what settings you 
applied with each tone mapped image. You can recall it and use on 
other images or, if needed, reprocess the current HDR image and 
make small changes. The tone mapping settings are saved in an 
XMP file.
 
 The settings files are a form of XML, which have setting names and 
values as text. They can be read by a text editor or Web browser, if 
you’re curious.
 
• Open Saved Image With (Mac): Select this check box, and after the 
image is saved, it will automatically open in the chosen application 
for further editing.
 
3. Close the image, and if desired, close Photomatix Pro.
 
 The tone mapped image is now ready to be edited further (see Chapters 
10 and 11) and published.
Tone Mapping in Photoshop
Tone mapping in Photoshop is much more streamlined than in an application 
like Photomatix Pro, essentially because you have so few options. Your main 
decision is to choose one of the four tone mapping methods, two of which 
don’t have any settings.

184
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
To tone map an HDR image in Photoshop, follow these steps:
 
1. Have your HDR image ready.
 
 You can load a previously saved HDR image or continue directly from 
creating the HDR image.
 
2. If necessary, perform adjustments on the HDR image.
 
 Photoshop allows you to perform limited adjustments on 32-bit HDR 
images. Be careful! What you see onscreen is not a completely accurate 
representation of the actual image unless you have a 32-bit-per-channel 
HDR monitor.
 
3. If you’re feeling adventurous, choose Image➪Duplicate.
 
 This sets up more than one copy of the HDR image so you can experi-
ment and apply a different conversion setting per duplicate image. You 
can switch back and forth between images to compare the effects of dif-
ferent methods and settings.
 
4. Choose Image➪Mode➪8 Bits/Channel or Image➪Mode➪16 Bits/
Channel to lower the bit depth.
 
 This opens the HDR Conversion dialog box, where you select the tone 
mapping method you want to use.
 
 Alternatively, you can jump from the Merge to HDR dialog box directly 
to the HDR Conversion dialog box if you select a lower bit depth than 
32 bits-per-channel when merging to HDR.
 
5. Choose a tone mapping method from the Method drop-down list and 
then experiment.
 
 Alter settings, switch methods to compare results, and experiment to 
decide the appropriate method and settings for your image. I discuss 
these settings in more detail in the following sections.
 
 You may also load settings from previous sessions (provided that you 
saved them). If you’re working on several HDR images of the same sub-
ject (say, an interior), create a master setting to save, and then apply to 
the additional HDR images of the same scene.
 
6. Process the image by clicking OK to apply the tone mapping settings.
 
7. Save the low dynamic range result by choosing File➪Save.
 
 You can continue to edit this file (reducing noise and such). Make sure 
to save your final results.
Exposure and Gamma
Choose Exposure and Gamma from the Method drop-down list in the HDR 
Conversion dialog box.

185
 Chapter 9: Tone Mapping for Fun and Profit
 
The key with adjusting the Exposure and Gamma sliders is to lower the 
Exposure setting so you don’t have any blown highlights, and then adjust 
the Gamma setting to get at the right lightness (which can affect contrast). It 
might not look like a good photo at this point — you’ll have to rely on more 
editing after tone mapping.
In this image (see Figure 9-13), the clouds were on the verge of blowing out until 
the Exposure was reduced. It wasn’t necessary to change the Gamma. Contrast 
can be enhanced later in editing through Levels or Curves adjustments.
Figure 9-13: Use Exposure and Gamma to protect highlights.
Highlight Compression
Choose Highlight Compression from the Method drop-down list in the HDR 
Conversion dialog box. Figure 9-14 shows the selection in the dialog box and 
the effect on the image. In this case, Highlight Compression does a good job 
of saving the clouds.

186
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Figure 9-14: Use Highlight Compression to squeeze the highlights to fit.
Equalize Histogram
Choose Equalize Histogram from the Method drop-down list in the HDR 
Conversion dialog box. Figure 9-15 shows the result of equalizing the histo-
gram. In this case, contrast is enhanced, but details are lost in dark areas of 
the building and in the clouds.
Local Adaptation
Choose Local Adaptation from the Method drop-down list in the HDR 
Conversion dialog box. Working with the Local Adaptation settings allows 
you to control the two sliders (Radius and Threshold) as well as alter the his-
togram. Begin by working on the histogram.

187
 Chapter 9: Tone Mapping for Fun and Profit
Figure 9-15: Equalizing the histogram squeezes the dynamic range of the image to fit.
 
When you hover your mouse over the image, as 
shown in Figure 9-16, the cursor becomes the Eye 
Dropper tool. Click to see the tone under the Eye 
Dropper appear on the histogram as a hollow dia-
mond. This lets you sample specific tonal regions 
and gauge whether to change the histogram for 
that area.
With that out of the way, see whether a combi-
nation of changing the Radius and Threshold 
settings from the default improves the image. 
In Figure 9-17, the Radius was increased to 
emphasize local contrast and the Threshold was 
decreased to avoid smoothing it over. The result 
is a bit sharper than the original with good 
contrast.

Dropper to examine specific 
tones on the histogram.

An Approach to Comparing Approaches
Individual images often look great. It’s when you compare two differently 
tone mapped versions of the same HDR image, however, that you see flaws 
you missed or something you like better in one but not the other.
 
Always save the original HDR image. This way, you can load it into your HDR 
application each time you want to tone map it. This saves you from having to 
generate it each time.
To compare different approaches to tone mapping an image, follow this gen-
eral process:
 
1. When you reach a point in tone mapping where you like the result, pro-
cess the image and save the result. Make sure to save the settings as 
well so you have a record of it.
 
2. Save the image as a JPEG. No need to get fancy here. You want some-
thing that loads quickly in a preview program, which improves your 
ability to discern nuanced differences as you flip back and forth.

189
 Chapter 9: Tone Mapping for Fun and Profit
 
3. Open the original HDR image 
and make a change to one 
setting — something you want 
to see if you can make better. 
Make single changes at a time. 
Try changing just the Strength, 
Color Saturation, Smoothing, 
Luminosity, or Microcontrast 
setting. It’s harder to gauge the 
effects of changing multiple 
settings at once because you 
don’t know which one might 
have helped and which one 
didn’t.
 
4. Save the second image. You 
can work up a third image with 
still another change to the 
same setting and have three 
options to choose from (Baby 
Bear, Mama Bear, and Papa 
Bear).
 
5. Open the images in your 
editor/organizer (Microsoft 
Picture and Fax Viewer in 
Windows/Preview on Mac work 
best because you can scroll 
through the images one after 
another) and look at your ver-
sions several times.
 
 Figure 9-18 illustrates three 
versions of an image tone 
mapped with different Strength 
settings. One is at 50, another 
at 75, and the last is at 100.
 
 What you’re looking for are 
subtle (and not so subtle) dif-
ferences in how you react to 
each image. All three in this 
case look good. That isn’t the issue. You’re after which one you like 
best. Pay special attention to how the tone migrates from the outside 
toward the center of the photo as the Strength increases. With a setting 
of 50, the basketball court is fairly light, and the bleachers are dark. At a 
Strength=50
Strength=75
Strength=100
Figure 9-18: Comparing different Strength 
settings to find the best image.

190
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Strength of 100, the court has darkened and the seats have lightened. In 
a completely subjective decision, I prefer the latter.
 
6. Decide on the best one and use that as the basis to move forward. Open 
the HDR image in Photomatix Pro, load the settings you just approved, 
and then make another change.
 
7. Continue until you’re satisfied. When the process is over, you’ll know for 
certain which settings you like best.
 
8. Save the final version as a 16-bit TIFF for the best quality and continue 
editing.
Batch-Processing Multiple Files
Be on the lookout for an HDR application that can perform batch processing, 
like Photomatix Pro. (See Chapter 3 for more information on other software 
packages.)
 
Batch processing is a real time and energy saver if you need to process 
several bracketed sets from the same photo shoot. This is paramount for 
processing panoramas. Aside from that circumstance, there’s no reason to 
develop different settings for each set of brackets unless you have an over-
riding need to treat a particular set differently (perhaps one angle produced 
a different color cast or the clouds moved out of the way and the scene got 
much brighter).
Photos shot in basically the same light at the same location might vary only 
a bit in composition and minor orientation. Using the same tone mapping 
settings makes sense because the same conditions produce the same basic 
image elements of lightness, contrast, and detail. Common tone mapping set-
tings also ensure consistency within the same photo shoot. This is especially 
helpful for interiors where you take different shots in the same room. The 
room hasn’t changed. The lighting hasn’t changed. The brackets are probably 
all shot at the same or very similar exposure settings.
The following steps illustrate how batch-processing multiple files works in 
Photomatix Pro:
 
1. Launch Photomatix Pro.
 
2. Generate the HDR image; choose Process➪Generate HDR.
 
 Generate an HDR image from a good set of brackets that are representa-
tive of the photo shoot.
 
3. Develop the tone mapping settings to your liking.
 
 See the earlier section, “Tone Mapping with Photomatix Pro,” for details.

191
 Chapter 9: Tone Mapping for Fun and Profit
 
4. Save the settings and close the tone mapped image.
 
 I like to process the image and save it as a concept or prototype file in 
either JPEG or 8-bit TIFF format. I can then open the image in an editor 
and check to see its potential or problems (color cast, noise, and so on). 
I don’t spend a lot of time developing it because I’m just trying to get a 
sense of where the image is going.
 
 You may forgo this step and simply save the settings in Photomatix, 
which doesn’t require processing the tone mapped image.
 
 The important part is finalizing the tone mapping settings and saving the 
settings file for use in batch processing.
 
5. Click the Batch Processing button from the Workflow Shortcuts 
window, which appears when you launch Photomatix Pro.
 
 The Batch Processing of Differently Exposed Images dialog box appears 
(see Figure 9-19), which has a number of options for you to choose from. 
Notice that it’s a pretty blank slate to work from the first time you run it.
Figure 9-19: Preparing to set up a batch session.
 
6. Select the Generate HDR Image check box to work with HDR (the 
other options allow you to fuse and blend exposures), click the 
Settings button beside the check box to access the HDR options, and 
then click OK.
 
 See Chapter 7 for more details on the HDR settings options.

 Clicking the Settings button 
opens another dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 9-20. There are 
a few differences in this dialog 
box compared with the rout-
ing to generate HDR. You can 
select the Force Exposure Value 
Spacing To check box and enter 
an amount, which can ensure 
the computer doesn’t make a 
mistake. You can also select the 
Process Strip by Strip check box 
if you want to avoid memory 
problems.
 
7. Choose tone mapping options 
and settings as described ear-
lier in this chapter, and then 
click OK.
 
 Check the Details Enhancer 
and/or Tone Compressor. In 
this case, the Details Enhancer 
is being used, and the settings 
are entered in the dialog box 
shown in Figure 9-21. You may enter the settings manually (as here) 
or load the settings file of the sample HDR image you tone mapped in 
Step 4.
 
8. Back in the Batch Processing of Differently Exposed Images dialog 
box, select the image-selection criteria by entering the number of 
images in the Select Images at a Time text box.
 
 You can identify the number of images to select for each bracketed 
set, or select the Advanced radio button, which lets you apply more 
advanced rules for selecting the images.
 
 It helps to have the same number of brackets in each bracketed step and 
have them be in the same folder on your hard drive (or each set in its 
own folder in a collective container folder). If you have three images in 
some sets and five images in others, select Advanced. In the dialog box 
that appears (as shown in Figure 9-22), select either the Automatically 
Detect Number of Bracketed Frames or the Select Only Part of the 
Frames in the Bracketed Set radio button.
 
9. Select the desired alignment and cropping options.

 Select the Align Images check 
box to align your images, or 
leave it deselected if you don’t 
want Photomatix to align them. 
Select the Don’t Crop check 
box to preserve your images. 
Choose whether to save the 
aligned output. These options 
are similar to the standard 
options you encounter when 
generat ing HDR.
 
10. Choose the source images by 
selecting the Folder or the 
Individual Files radio button; 
click the Select Source Folder 
or Select Source Files button 
to browse to the desired 
folder on your hard drive.
 
 You can select a folder or 
individual files. After you have 
files selected, you can remove 
files and filter them by select-
ing the files in the preview 
box and clicking the Remove 
File button or selecting an 
option from the Filter By drop-
down list, which allows you to 
select certain types (such as 
JPEG). You may also select the 
Process Subfolders check box, 
which helps if your brackets 
are stored in their own folders 
within a container folder.
 
11. Select the Created under Source Folder radio button to save your 
batch-processed files in the source folder; or select the Customized 
Location radio button and then click the Choose button to specify a 
different destination for the files.
 
12. Select the file format to save from the Save As drop-down list, adjust 
the JPEG Quality setting if desired, and choose an option for HDR 
image format from the Save 32-Bit HDR Image As drop-down list.
 
 If you’re saving the 32-bit HDR image, select the Remove 32-Bit HDR 
Image After Tone Mapping check box if you want to delete the HDR 
image after tone mapping.

13. (Optional) Click the Naming 
Options button to select your 
own naming options for the 
processed files, as shown in 
Figure 9-23.
 
 Notice that you have a few 
options to start with and that 
you can append a word or 
phrase to the end. Starting with 
the processed set is a good 
choice if you want the results 
organized by set number, 
while selecting the Start with 
Filename of First Image in the 
Set radio button is good if you 
want to organize by the image 
file names.
 
14. Finally, click the Run button.
 
 This starts the process. You 
see interim progress reports 
show up in the dialog box as 
Photomatix Pro works its way 
through all the images. When 
it’s done, you’re notified. Close 
the dialog box.
Batch-Processing 
Single Files
It’s an added bonus if your HDR 
application performs batch pro-
cessing on single files, as does 
Photomatix Pro. You might think the 
whole concept stinks of oxymoronic 
malfeasance, but it makes sense when you face north, close your left eye, 
and hum “Happy Birthday.” You’ll realize that single files (an oxymoron in 
and of itself) refers to a collection of single Raw images converted to pseudo-
HDR or a collection of HDR images (not the brackets). In other words, say 
you have several single-exposure Raw images that you want processed with 
the same tone mapping settings. You can’t use normal batch processing 
because that requires multiple bracketed exposures. You have to batch-
process single files.
Figure 9-23: Selecting naming options.
Figure 9-22: If your brackets are complicated, 
select from Advanced options.

195
 Chapter 9: Tone Mapping for Fun and Profit
The other scenario where you might want to use this technique is when you 
already created a bunch of HDR images (possibly through batch processing) 
and want to apply the same tone mapping settings to them. You don’t need to 
re-create the HDR images — all you need to do is feed the single HDR images 
collectively into the batch process single files hopper.
The same general prep work for bracketed exposure batch processing 
applies here (see the previous section), and the steps are similar. Follow 
Steps 1–5 in the “Batch-Processing Multiple Files” section, and then follow 
these steps for processing batches of single files:
 
1. Select a conversion type and method:
 
• If you’re working with single Raw images: Select the Convert Raw 
Files into Pseudo-HDR Images check box, and then select the tone 
mapping options you want to employ.
 
• If you’re tone mapping existing HDR images (pseudo or not): Select 
the Tone Map HDR Image Files or Psuedo-HDR Images With check 
box, as shown in Figure 9-24.
Figure 9-24: Selecting a single source conversion method.

2. Click the Settings button and enter your tone mapping settings manu-
ally or with a preset.
 
3. Click the Select Folder button and browse to the source folder.
 
 Identify the folder that contains the single Raw images to convert and 
tone map, or existing HDR images to tone map.
 
4. Select a destination and format by selecting the Created under Source 
Folder or the Customized Location radio button.
 
 If you select the Customized Location radio button, click the Choose 
button to choose to have the results saved in a subfolder within the 
source folder or in a new location.
 
5. If you’re simply converting single Raw exposures to pseudo-HDR, 
choose a format from the Save 32-Bit HDR Image As drop-down list. 
You can also choose the final tone mapped image format from the 
Save Tone Mapped Image As drop-down list.
 
6. Click the Run button and close the dialog box when Photomatix is 
done with the batch process.
 
 Photomatix processes the images according to your wishes, and gives 
you status reports along the way.

Layers, Process, and Blending
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding layers and big league layer management
▶ Optimizing your workflow
▶ Blending, blending, and more blending
A
chapter in an HDR photography book on layers, process, and blending? 
Yup. Layers, process, and blending are important topics when it comes 
to editing a tone mapped HDR image. Layers make a lot of things — like 
blending — possible. You can use layers to make different adjustments and 
changes, track changes, evaluate different approaches, and undo your work 
to various points in the process to start fresh.
Managing layers is part of an overall process where you try to work 
in a fairly structured way to achieve specific goals rather than 
work randomly or haphazardly. That’s not to say that ran-
domness isn’t fun, but when you try and re-create or 
remember something you’ve done in an earlier image, 
you’ll appreciate a bit of order.
Blending, which relies on manipulating layers, 
enables you to make things look more or less real-
istic, correct specific problems within your images, 
and accentuate or protect positive aspects from 
other edits. (For example, noise reduction notori-
ously degrades your images.) You can selectively 
edit and control how things appear in the final image.
In the end, it’s up to you to decide how and when to use 
layers and blending, and to use the processes and workflow 
that makes the most sense to you. However, the information in 
this chapter can make post-HDR editing much more productive and 
rewarding for you.

198
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Taking the Layers Refresher Course
Layers are indispensible tools to use if you want professional editing results. 
It’s that simple. They assist you while you edit your tone mapped HDR 
images and make certain techniques — such as blending — possible. If you 
don’t use layers often, spend time in this chapter coming to grips with what 
they are and how they work.
The lasagna of layers
Photoshop Elements 8 (like virtually all dedicated graphics applications 
today) can store image elements — such as copies of the image with different 
effects and adjustments applied independently — on layers. It’s like stacking 
different images on top of each other. Each layer is unique, but in the same 
file. Layers combine to create what you see.
If you’ve ever eaten lasagna, you know what I’m talking about. Each layer 
of pasta, cheese, and sauce builds on the one below it and they all work 
together to make the dish. Layers. Lasagna.
 
Unlike the layers you’ll find in lasagna, though, image layers are separate and 
can be selected, moved, deleted, and edited independently. They don’t con-
geal or otherwise stick together (unless you link them, but no need to get into 
that here). There is, however, a pecking order to what you can and can’t see. 
A layer on the bottom is normally invisible — covered up by layers above it. 
There are exceptions to this, which spices things up — and makes blending 
possible.
The exceptions are
 
✓ Transparency: Pixels and layers can be deleted (or not painted). When 
this happens, what’s there is a transparent pixel or layer. It still exists, 
but it has no content. It’s like a transparent sheet that allows everything 
beneath it to show through.
 
 Transparent areas allow you to blend the contents of different layers 
together as if they were one solid image. This is very helpful if you want 
to sharpen one area of an image but not the rest. You would put the 
sharpened layer above one without extra sharpening and delete pixels 
from the sharper layer that you don’t want to appear sharpened.
 
 Figure 10-1 illustrates replacement clouds in an image. The rest of the 
layer has been deleted. You can see the transparent areas as a checker-
board, which allows whatever is underneath this layer to be seen. The 
bottom layer, which has the building and the rest of the scene, is hidden 
at the moment. When it is turned on, the clouds blend right in.

199
 Chapter 10: Layers, Process, and Blending
Figure 10-1: Transparent pixels are see-through.
 
✓ Semi-transparency (also known as opacity): Pixels and layers can be 
partially transparent. This means they haven’t been completely deleted. 
They’re only mostly deleted (like in The Princess Bride). This allows con-
tent below to show through, but only partially.
 
 Opacity is a great way to blend parts of layers or entire layers together. 
Overlaying a realistic semi-transparent layer on top of a less realistic 
version of the image increases the apparent realism of the image.
 
 Figure 10-2 shows the effects of a partially transparent layer on top of 
the background. The nontransparent pixels in the clouds layer have 
been selected so you can see their extent. The layer’s visibility has been 
reduced to 49% to blend.
 
✓ Blending modes: This is when you get to change the rules. Normally, 
opacity is king, which means that layers are blended — or blocked — 
based on what layers on top are opaque. You can change this behavior 
to include blending based on lightness, color, differences, and so forth. 
Refer to Chapter 13 for more about using the Color blending mode to 
tint images.

200
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
 
✓ Masking: Masking is a form of transparency and semi-transparency, but 
it’s not available in Photoshop Elements (except when you’re working 
with panoramas). When you mask something, you’re telling Photoshop 
to hide it, which allows content below to shine through. See Chapter 12 
for more on using masks.
 
 If you have Photoshop Elements, you can duplicate the effect of masks 
by erasing parts of layers. You won’t be able to alter the area after it’s 
deleted (which is one of the best things about a mask), but the blending 
works the same way.
Figure 10-2: Layers can be semi-transparent, too.
Managing layers
Being able to manage your layers is important, especially if you’re using them 
to perform complex image blending. Here are some of the more important 
layer commands you should be familiar with in Photoshop Elements 8:
 
✓ Select a layer. Click the layer thumbnail or name to select it. This makes 
the layer active. Just about everything you do (paint, erase, apply 
adjustments, alter layer opacity, and so on) happens to the selected 
layer.

201
 Chapter 10: Layers, Process, and Blending
 
✓ Duplicate a layer. This creates a copy of the layer you selected and 
puts it above the original. You have a chance to rename the copy as you 
create it. I use this all the time in my methodology (which I show you in 
a bit). To duplicate a layer, right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) 
the layer in the Layers palette and choose Duplicate Layer.
 
✓ Rename a layer. Being able to rename any layer is helpful to keep 
track of what you’re doing. Rename the layers according to what you’re 
doing with them. For example, you could rename a layer to Sharpen, 
indicating you sharpened it. To rename a layer, double-click its name in 
the Layers palette. Type in a new name and click elsewhere to complete 
the operation.
 
✓ Drag and drop layers. Click to drag and then release to drop a layer to 
change its order in the Layers palette, as shown in Figure 10-3. I don’t 
normally need to move a bunch of layers around, but you can duplicate 
your Background layer and move it to the top to quickly compare the 
final versus original image by hiding and showing the new top layer.
Click the Eye icon to show/hide a layer.
Click, drag, and release to reorder a layer.
Figure 10-3: Moving a layer.

202
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
 
✓ Hide a layer. Poke the eyeball 
next to the layer thumbnail (as 
seen in Figure 10-3) to turn off 
the layer. Poke the empty box 
where it was to turn the layer 
back on.
 
✓ Change the opacity. Use the 
arrow shown in Figure 10-4 to 
access the Opacity slider. Move 
it back and forth to change the 
opacity of the layer you have 
chosen. Remember, this affects 
the selected layer. Make sure 
you have the correct layer 
selected before altering the opacity. You can also select the opacity per-
centage and enter a new value from your keyboard.
 
✓ Use a blending mode. Select the Blending Mode drop-down list (refer to 
Figure 10-4) to access the long list of blending modes (discussed 
in a bit).
 
✓ The rest: Of course, you can delete layers, link layers, merge layers, and 
so forth, but these commands are beyond what I want to show you. (For 
more information on these topics, you can pick up Photoshop Elements 8 For 
Dummies by Barbara Obermeier and Ted Padova [Wiley].) The more you 
study layers, the more you will open up the commands and options. As you 
do so, you will continue to enhance your ability to edit HDR images.
Mama Mia Methodologia
While I’m talking about layers and how to manage them, this seems like a 
good place to show you my strategy of how you can use layers effectively in 
HDR, which boils down to using layers to track your edits — locking them in 
the file via layers. This allows you to be more consistent, experiment with dif-
ferent approaches to the same image, and go back to any stage in the process 
to try something new without having to start over from scratch. Following 
those general principles, you see my detailed workflow. This takes the basic 
strategy and turns it into a practical series of steps to follow.
Editing with layers
There are pros and cons to the methodology and workflow I use — and you 
certainly don’t have to copy it exactly. I developed this workflow over the 
years working with photo retouching and restoration, image manipulation, 
graphics and Web development, and HDR.

 Chapter 10: Layers, Process, and Blending
To wit, here are the principles, starting with a tone mapped HDR image:
 
✓ Save as PSD. Open up your tone mapped HDR image and immediately 
save it as a Photoshop (PSD) file. This preserves the original tone 
mapped file. Also, any layers you add will be preserved and editable the 
next time you open the PSD file.
 
 The PSD file is, therefore, your highest quality, uncropped, unresized 
working file. You work with the PSD file until it’s finalized and you’re ready 
to publish the image. (For example, if you want to put the image on the 
Web, you need to reduce the image size and save it as a JPEG to make it 
small enough that it doesn’t choke people’s Internet connections.)
 
✓ Preserve the Background layer. Preserve the Background layer (as 
shown in Figure 10-5) as the inviolable source image by duplicating 
the layer and never making any edits to the Background layer. In this 
case, it is your tone mapped HDR image that you open up to create the 
Photoshop file. Keeping the Background layer safe makes it possible to 
compare your work with the tone mapped original, which in turn makes 
it possible to evaluate whether your changes look better or worse.
 
✓ Merge layers. Merged layers are special layers where I combine the 
results of blended and semi-transparent layers into one opaque work-
ing layer. I can show/hide the merged layer by clicking the Eye icon to 
compare the merged layer against any other layer in the file. This makes 
it easy to evaluate your progress, and also provides a firm foundation to 
make more edits on.
 
 To create a merged layer, select the top, visible layer and then choose 
Select➪All. (Should you have any layers above where you want to copy, 
click the Eye icon to hide them.) Next, choose Edit➪Copy Merged. Finally, 
paste the merged layer at the top of the Layers palette and rename it.
 
 Figure 10-5 shows what this looks like on the Layers palette. The 
Background layer is untouched and provides the blending base. Noise 
reduction has been applied to the sky and water, but erased from the trees 
and bridge. The merged layer rests on top, making the bottom two layers 
irrelevant except for situational awareness and backtracking purposes.
 
✓ Duplicate and do: Duplicate a layer, rename it, and then apply one 
adjustment to it: one — and only one — change. Keeping this simple 
makes it easy to track your changes, compare results, and backtrack if 
you need to.
 
 Some people prefer to work with Adjustment layers, but I don’t use 
them. (Adjustment layers are essentially overlays that contain lighting, 
color, and other edits that affect the layers beneath them — but do not 
imprint the changes on the layers themselves.) My experience is they 
create a large file, slowing down my work too much, and make it harder 
to manage multiple changes. They do, however, preserve the settings 
better than standard layers do. You can, however, write the settings 
down for later use.

204
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Lock the Background layer.
Figure 10-5: Merged layers lock blending layers into a single solid layer.
Depending on the image (follow along with Figure 10-6), I might have the fol-
lowing layers (from top to bottom, as you would see it in the Layers palette):
 
✓ Final: The final image that I use to save as the final full-sized image or as 
a new file to continue working. It’s the same as the last layer or a merged 
copy of semi-transparent layers beneath it, but I like having one named 
Final so I can see it immediately.
 
✓ Transform: A layer where I had to rotate, reposition, or remove lens 
distortion.
 
✓ Merged: Combines the Saturation and Contrast layers, resulting in a 
solid layer with all the changes.
 
✓ Saturation: Contains a saturation adjustment. Areas I don’t want over-
saturated are erased.
 
✓ Contrast: Contains a contrast adjustment. Areas where I want less con-
trast are erased.
 
✓ Clone: Contains the results of cloning out dust or other distractions.

205
 Chapter 10: Layers, Process, and Blending
 
✓ Merged: Combines the results of noise reduction with the previous 
merged layer.
 
✓ Noise reduction: Contains noise reduction, with areas I want left alone 
either erased or masked out.
 
✓ Background: The original image.
Figure 10-6: A working file with layer history.
If you’re new to working with layers, you may feel a little overwhelmed. If 
that’s the case, pay close attention to the screen shots in the next few chap-
ters. You’ll see the layers arranged as I’ve presented here. This approach 
also represents my workflow, which is coming up next.
The workflow (cue reveal music)
To get to this point, you took bracketed photos, created and tone mapped 
the HDR image, and then saved the tone mapped image as a JPEG or TIFF. 
Although you could publish that version to the Web, you’ll have a better 
looking image if you correct problems like noise and make other enhance-
ments like sharpening and contrast adjustments to the tone mapped image 
before you publish or print it.

206
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
The following sections describe my post–tone mapping workflow and why I 
use it.
Save the image as a PSD
The first step in my workflow is to save the tone mapped image as a PSD as 
follows:
 
1. Open your tone mapped file in Photoshop Elements.
 
2. Choose File➪Save As and save the file in the Photoshop (.psd) format.
 
 This ensures you don’t overwrite the tone mapped file.
 
3. Choose Image➪Mode➪8 Bits/Channel to convert the file to 8 bits.
 
 If necessary, convert an 16 bits-per-channel tone mapped image to an 
8 bits-per-channel image first. Photoshop Elements provides limited 
support for 16 bits-per-channel images. For example, you can’t duplicate 
the Background layer of a 16 bits-per-channel image in Elements, you 
can’t use the Enhance➪Convert to Black and White command, nor can 
you use the Filter➪Correct Camera Distortion command to correct lens 
distortions. However, when I work in Photoshop (which is most of the 
time), I don’t convert my images to 8 bits-per-channel. Photoshop has 
more mojo on tap to work with 16 bits-per-channel images.
Look for places to blend material from alternate sources
Be on the lookout for areas where you may need to blend material in from 
alternate sources. For example, if part of the sky is blown out, you might 
want to replace the blown-out sky with a version that has been tone mapped 
differently so the sky looks better (what often happens is the rest of the 
photo stinks, but that’s why you’re looking to blend the sky in and not a com-
plete image). See the later section, “And Now, Blending in 3-D,” to find the 
details of how to accomplish this.
It’s not easy to say in every instance at what point blending should take 
place. Sometimes, it’s best to do this as soon as possible — before sharpen-
ing, noise reduction, and so forth. However, you might have to wait and blend 
later in the process, depending on the tonality of the images you’re blending.
Figure 10-7 shows two areas that use alternate sources to blend with the tone 
mapped background. The sky was a bit blown out, and the lighting in and out 
of the garage looked bad in this version. The red layer (named helper) is so 
you can identify the extent of the new material and is not part of the image as 
I would edit it.
Duplicate the Background layer and sharpen
(Remember, you want to preserve the Background layer so you have the 
original tone mapped image within this file.)

207
 Chapter 10: Layers, Process, and Blending
 
Figure 10-7: Replacing material immediately in this case.
Create a duplicate of the Background layer, or create a merged copy if you 
already have several layers. Make sure you rename the layer in the Layers 
palette. (See the earlier section, “Managing layers,” for instructions on dupli-
cating and renaming layers.)
If necessary, sharpen the image (make sure your new duplicate layer is 
selected first) by choosing Enhance➪Adjust Sharpness or Enhance➪
Unsharp Mask. The Adjust Sharpness dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 
10-8, where I’m sharpening the building. The sign is a good guide to see the 
effects. If necessary, use the blending techniques shown in the “And Now, 
Blending in 3-D” section to isolate what you want sharpened and blend that 
in with the rest of the image.
 
From this point on, I assume you get the point about duplicating layers and 
why I do this. You’ll want to keep at it, renaming as you go along. If you have 
semi-transparent blended layers, duplicating isn’t enough. You have to select 
the entire canvas, perform a merged copy, and then paste that as a new layer. 
(See the earlier section, “Editing with layers,” for instructions.)

208
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Perform noise reduction
Reducing noise is similar 
to sharpening. Create a 
duplicate layer, and then 
choose Filter➪Noise➪
Reduce Noise. Figure 10-9 
shows the Reduce Noise 
dialog box open with the 
default settings being 
applied to the sky.
I perform sharpening 
and noise reduction 
first from trial and error. 
I used to wait to sharpen 
and remove noise until 
after I made other 
adjustments (contrast, 
levels, color, saturation, 
and so on). However, I 
invariably ran into an 
unfortunate side effect: 
Sharpening and noise 
removal altered the look 
of the image so much 
that I needed to go back 
and perform many of 
the same tasks again. 
I therefore decided to 
sharpen and perform 
noise reduction first 
and ask questions later.
Clone away dust and 
other problems
I tackle dust and other distractions before I make other changes so every-
thing is in place for the tone and brightness changes coming up. To clean up 
an imperfection, select the Clone Stamp tool, Alt-click (Windows) or Option-
click (Mac) a “good” area near the imperfection, and then click the marred 
spot. I wait until after sharpening/noise reduction because those operations 
increase or reduce edge contrast, and I prefer not to give them any additional 
material to alter that isn’t in the original.

Figure 10-8: Sharpen the duplicate layer.

209
 Chapter 10: Layers, Process, and Blending
Check color (that is, white) 
balance and brightness
Choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪
Levels to open the Levels dialog box 
(as shown in Figure 10-10). Click the 
Auto button to see whether you like 
the change. After this, look at the 
histogram. Then select the individual 
color channels and examine their 
histograms.
Sometimes, a correction is neces-
sary; sometimes, it isn’t. You can 
alter an image’s contrast through the 
Levels dialog box, but I prefer to use 
the Curves dialog box for that.
Correct obnoxious color problems
There’s a difference between tweaking color to enhance (which I do later) and 
solving color problems (which I do here). Sometimes, you’ll have an image 
with too much of a single color. You can control this from the Hue/Saturation 
dialog box (choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation).
Enhance brightness and contrast
I use the Adjust Color 
Curves dialog box to 
enhance the brightness 
and contrast. Choose 
Enhance➪Adjust Color➪
Adjust Color Curves to 
open this dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 10-11.
 
Detailed info on how to 
tweak brightness/contrast 
and many other tasks can 
be found in this and the 
following two chapters. 
Don’t worry. Here, I’m 
talking you through the 
workflow.
You can also choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting ➪Brightness/Contrast or even 
Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Shadows/Highlights.

Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Make creative saturation 
adjustments
Saturation adjustments can be 
varied. In general, I look to increase 
saturation to add some pop. You 
can also reduce saturation to make 
the photo look a bit aged. Choose 
Adjustments➪Adjust Color➪Hue/
Saturation to open the Hue/
Saturation dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 10-12.
Dodge and burn
Use the Dodge or Burn tools to add 
highlights and shadows where you 
want them. (The Dodge tool lightens 
the area you paint, while the Burn tool darkens the area.) When well done, 
this adds to the overall impact of the photo. Clouds look great when you add 
tone this way (a smidge of both), as do trees and other greenery. (I normally 
lighten the highlights of trees.)
(Optional) Convert to black and white
 
I cover converting images to black and white in Chapter 13. Although it looks 
like I wait a long time for this step, remember that you don’t have to apply 
every adjustment to every image. For images I know I want to be in black and 
white, I might skip a lot of the color adjustments unless I think they will add 
to how the black-and-white image is converted.
Correct distortions and straighten
Correct any lens distor-
tions and straighten 
the image by choosing 
Filter➪Correct Camera 
Distortion to open 
the Correct Camera 
Distortion dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 10-13. 
Remember that you’re 
working on a duplicate 
layer built up from all the 
previous steps, and you 
could be up to eight or 
ten layers by now.
Figure 10-12: Increasing color intensity.
Figure 10-13: Correcting distortion in the image.

211
 Chapter 10: Layers, Process, and Blending
I wait until I’m almost done to correct distortion and straighten an image 
because these corrections (and the following one) change what pixels are vis-
ible onscreen. If I want to come back and alter how I corrected the distortion 
or recomposed the image, I don’t have to start everything over from scratch. 
I simply pick up at the last layer, duplicate it again, choose Filter➪Correct 
Camera Distortion, and change the settings I used earlier.
You can sometimes combine this and the next step if you don’t have any dis-
tortion to fix.
Recompose
I save recomposing for last, for the same reason I wait to correct lens distor-
tion next-to-last.
I transform images by 
enlarging this layer (see 
Figure 10-14) rather than 
cropping the entire image. 
You can see the drag han-
dles and border outside 
of the image frame — this 
area is the actual extent 
of the image and is effec-
tively cropped from view 
by this technique. There 
are some drawbacks to 
this — mainly that it takes 
up a lot of memory and 
can make performance 
sluggish. If your computer 
can handle it, however, 
this method preserves all 
the layers underneath in 
their uncropped state.
 
If your computer is getting sluggish because your image file is too big and 
bulky (hence the overall memory load is getting larger and larger), save the 
file, and then simplify your layer structure by deleting everything but your 
uppermost working layer and background. Save the image as a new working 
version with a new filename. Continue working in the new, slimmer file — 
starting where you left off.
You can also choose Select➪All and then Image➪Crop to erase everything 
outside the image boundaries. This deletes all the super-sized extra stuff.
Figure 10-14: Recomposing the image.

Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Publish
Your original tone mapped file was either a JPEG or TIFF. You should 
be working with a Photoshop Elements (PSD) file when you’re editing to 
enhance the image. When you publish your final image, save a new version of 
the PSD as a JPEG (for Web use) or a TIFF (for archive and printing).
And Now, Blending in 3-D
Clearly, some edits don’t require blending. Say the image looks great. A little 
sharpening across the image is fine. There is no need for noise reduction. 
You don’t see any reason (creative or otherwise) to blend different changes 
together. Cool. That happens. And when it does, don’t mess it up by over-
working the image.
On the other hand, sometimes it’s not so simple. You might want to sharpen 
one part of the image more than the rest, or add a touch of realism to the 
entire image. You can do these things, and more, if you blend results from 
different adjustments on different layers.
 
Blending enables you to think and edit in three dimensions.
Blending with opacity
One of the simplest ways to blend two or more layers is to lower the opac-
ity of the upper layers. I often use opacity blending to add a touch of realism 
back into a tone mapped image, especially with people.
I use this technique all the time. Say you want to make a contrast adjustment 
but decide to tone it down some — just follow these steps:
 
1. Duplicate the layer on which you want to make the adjustment.
 
 This is another reason to work with different layers: It opens up a 
number of blending opportunities.
 
2. Make the adjustment.
 
 The contrast adjustment is good, but a little too strong. (See the left side 
of Figure 10-15.) Rather than continually undoing and redoing, it’s sim-
pler to blend the right strength by altering opacity on the contrast layer. 
See the right side of Figure 10-15.
 
3. Create a merged layer, as described in the earlier section, “Editing 
with layers.” (See Figure 10-16.)
 
4. Continue working.

213
 Chapter 10: Layers, Process, and Blending
Figure 10-15: Blending just the right amount.
Photoshop has an Edit➪Fade com-
mand that essentially works the 
same way as opacity blending. Make 
the adjustment you wish, and then 
immediately fade it by a certain 
percentage. I prefer to use layers 
because you can fiddle with it later, 
but you might find Fade worth your 
time.
 
You can stack a number of layers on 
top of each other, each having their 
own opacity, to create a very com-
plex blend. As described in Chapter 
13, this is an effective way of color-
izing or tinting an image.
Blending select areas
Unfortunately, Photoshop Elements doesn’t allow you to create and edit 
masks. Masks make the selective application of changes to an image pretty 
easy — and you can edit the mask after you create it.
You can duplicate the effects of masking with the good old-fashioned Eraser, 
though. Here’s how.
Figure 10-16: Locking in the blend.

214
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
 
1. Duplicate the layer on which 
you want to make the 
adjustment.
 
 In this case (see Figure 10-17), I 
duplicated the Background layer 
twice — once for a sharpening 
adjustment and another to 
reduce noise. This is an alternate 
method that splits sharpening 
and noise reduction. Instead of 
performing one adjustment on 
top of the other, they will be 
completely independent and 
blended after the fact.
 
2. Make the adjustments.
 
 In this example, I’m sharpening 
the foreground and reducing 
noise in the sky on two separate 
layers. Figure 10-18 shows the 
Layers palette after the adjust-
ments have been made and the 
layers renamed. They’re ready 
to blend.
 
3. Select the Eraser tool and erase 
what you don’t want sharpened 
on the sharpen layer.
 
 Because this isn’t a mask, you 
have to be careful and erase 
only what you don’t want to see 
sharpened. Don’t be afraid to undo. Change brush sizes and hardness 
to make erasing easier. You want to blend the edges, so stay away from 
hard brushes.
 
 I’m erasing the sky in Figure 10-19 because it doesn’t need to be sharp-
ened. In fact, if you sharpen skies with too much noise, you end up with 
sharp noise that’s even harder to remove than the traditional variety. 
Notice that the other layers are hidden. This ensures you are working on 
the right layer and are erasing only what you want to.
 
 In Figure 10-20, I switched to the noise reduction layer and am erasing 
the cityscape, which needs no noise reduction. Again, I turned off the 
other layers so I can tell exactly what I’m doing.
 
 If you want to get really creative, combine this technique with altering 
layer opacity. In other words, reduce the strength of your noise reduc-
tion and sharpening layers to blend them with the background. The 
blending possibilities are astounding.

with.
Figure 10-18: Ready to blend.

215
 Chapter 10: Layers, Process, and Blending
Figure 10-19: Erase areas to leave unsharpened.
 
4. Create a merged layer to lock in your changes to one layer, as 
described in the “Editing with layers” section.
 
 It helps to leave the Background layer (or another one underneath the 
operation) on when you copy the merged layers. This makes sure you 
have no transparent or semi-transparent pixels in the mix. Figure 10-21 
shows the blended and merged copy layer, resting atop the work layers. 
If everything blended together nicely, this is your new Background layer.
 
5. Continue working.
The great thing about this technique is that you can use it with any number 
of layers. If you want a lot of noise reduction in the sky, some on the build-
ings, a little in the water, and none in the trees, create three duplicate layers, 
adjust them differently, and then erase the areas you don’t need. They will 
blend together (along with the base layer, which remained unchanged) to 
form a completely customized and blended result.
 
If you’re using Photoshop or another application that supports masks, use 
masks instead. They have the advantage of being flexible — you can edit 
what is hidden and what is exposed.

216

Photoshop versus Photoshop Elements
Yes, Photoshop has even more powerful and 
creative ways to blend layers together than its 
little brother Photoshop Elements. What would 
you expect from the leading photo editing appli-
cation? There are a few differences between 
Photoshop and Elements that you might find 
interesting.
Layers in Photoshop have blending options 
based on a tonal range you define. Aside from 
selecting a blend mode and opacity, you can 
specify advanced blending parameters and set 
blending conditions on the tonality of the current 
layer or that below. To access these features, 
right-click the layer in the Layers palette and 
choose Blending Options.
The other major difference is the fact that 
Photoshop supports (and that’s an under-
statement) masks. Elements does not, except 
when you open a Photoshop file with masks in 
it, create a panorama, or use clipping masks 
(which is a type of mask, but not comparable 
to the classic mask). Masks are wonderful tools 
to use: like erasing part of the layer without 
erasing it because you can always go back and 
refine the mask.

 Chapter 10: Layers, Process, and Blending

Using blending modes
Blending modes are powerful ways to control — yes, you guessed it — blend-
ing. The default blending mode in Photoshop Elements is called Normal, 
which is based on opacity. A number of blending modes are available in 
Photoshop Elements, and some are more useful than others. Table 10-1 
shows how they are grouped into different sections on the menu.

To use blending modes, follow these steps:
 
1. Duplicate the layer you want to make the adjustment to.
 
2. (Optional) Make adjustments.
 
 In this example, I made two creative decisions. First, I turned the 
duplicate layer into a gradient map by choosing Filter➪Adjustments➪
Gradient Map (see Figure 10-22).
Figure 10-22: Create the gradient map.

219
 Chapter 10: Layers, Process, and Blending
 
 Next, I colorized the gradi-
ent map layer by choosing 
Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Hue 
Saturation. The dialog box is 
shown in Figure 10-23.
 
 You don’t actually have to make 
adjustments — changing the 
blending mode doesn’t require 
you to. However, this is a cre-
ative way to show you another 
way to colorize an image.
 
3. Select a mode from the 
Blending Mode drop-down 
list.
 
 In this case, I selected Hue. 
The effects are shown in 
Figure 10-24.

4. Create a merged layer, as described earlier in the “Editing with 
layers” section.
 
5. Continue working.
Of course, you can stack layers, each with a different blending mode, for com-
plex results. Most often, however, you’ll use a single layer above another.

T
one mapped images don’t always come out of your favorite HDR applica-
tion looking perfect. In fact, most of the time, they need further editing 
before they’re “perfect.” Some images have too much noise (a 
common problem with HDR) in general, or they may need dif-
ferent levels of noise reduction in different areas. Some have 
dust, moving objects, or other distracting things that are 
best removed. Many images have lens distortion, which 
wide angle lenses tend to accentuate. At times, you’ll 
see color problems — too much, too little, too much 
of a single color, or the wrong color. And on top of all 
this, artifacts can appear in tone mapped images that 
are the result of movement in the scene.
This chapter shows you common problems that 
plague HDR images and gives you solid techniques 
to combat them. I show you how to reduce noise and 
blend that reduction in with the rest of the image, and 
I show you a few different ways to remove distractions, 
such as dust and other objects.

222
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
This chapter won’t show you how to correct every image problem in the 
known universe in every possible way — but you won’t run into many prob-
lems that aren’t here or in the other chapters. (This chapter is organized 
by types of problems and doesn’t reflect the contents of the entire editing 
workflow. For workflow information, see Chapter 10.)
Hey! Keep the Noise Down in There!
Noise, as I mention several times throughout this book, is problematic for 
HDR. Although you can attempt to reduce noise in other parts of the HDR 
process, you have the most control over where, how, and how much to 
remove in post-tone mapping editing.
The thing to remember with noise is that you are always on the horns of a 
dilemma (see Figure 11-1):
 
✓ Too little: If you’re not firm enough, you’ll leave unwanted noise in your 
image.
 
✓ Too much: If you’re too aggressive, you can destroy lines and detail in 
your images, resulting in something without sharpness — a soft image. 
(Chapter 15 holds other examples of too much noise reduction.)
Well, the point of noise reduction is to reduce noise, right? If you don’t go far 
enough, you leave in noise — but if you go too far, you can hurt the image. 
What’s a person to do?
Figure 11-1: Noise reduction: too little (left), just right (middle), too much (right).
Global noise smackdown
You can always apply noise reduction to the entire layer you’re working 
on. This is the massive retaliation option. See it. Smack it. Smell the burn. 

223
 Chapter 11: Cleaning Up Your Photos
It’s pretty easy to do, too, which is a bonus. (See Photoshop Elements 8 For 
Dummies by Barbara Obermeier and Ted Padova [Wiley] for plenty of details 
about using Elements.)
Here’s how to apply noise reduction in Photoshop Elements:
 
1. Duplicate the layer you want to make the adjustment on.
 
 See Chapter 10 for my rationale on working with different layers.
 
 You can’t duplicate the Background layer in Photoshop Elements if you 
haven’t converted the image to 8 Bits/Channel.
 
 Figure 11-2 illustrates a working noise reduction layer above the back-
ground. Apply noise reduction to this layer, and then duplicate it and 
continue working. You end up with a file with layers stacked on each 
other — each with a different adjustment.
Figure 11-2: Preparing the working layer first.
 
2. Choose Filter➪Noise➪Reduce Noise to start the process.
 
3. In the Reduce Noise dialog box that opens (see Figure 11-3), 
choose from

224
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Figure 11-3: Reducing noise.
 
• Strength (0–10): Determine how strongly you want to seek out 
and destroy noise. The catch is that Strength targets noise (the 
random, mottled specks of random pixels) that’s gray, black, 
or white — luminance noise.
 
• Preserve Details (0–100%): Set how much you want to try to protect 
edge details in the image. This basically allows you to set a high 
Strength and have Elements remove noise in larger areas but not 
overdo it when it comes to lines and edges.
 
• Reduce Color Noise (0–100%): Set this strength setting for noise 
that shows up in the image as variations in color.
 
• Remove JPEG Artifact: If you see JPEG compression artifacts, select-
ing this check box tries to take them out. This shouldn’t be much 
of a problem for your HDR images.
 
4. Select OK to apply noise reduction.
 
5. Continue working.
Although you can use other methods for noise reduction in Photoshop 
Elements, Reduce Noise is the most applicable to HDR images because it 
works well to reduce noise without as much blurring, and happens to be 
more customizable than alternate methods. Try the other methods (acces-
sible from the Filters➪Noise menu), though, to see whether they work for 
you in certain circumstances:
 
✓ Despeckle: This filter blurs everything except edges and produces a much 
softer image, which is fine in theory, or when you have a lot of speckles. 
You have no control over the strength, though, but you can blend. See the 
before and after in Figure 11-4.

225
 Chapter 11: Cleaning Up Your Photos
 
✓ Dust & Scratches: 
Don’t confuse this 
filter as having any-
thing to do with 
removing sensor 
dust spots (which 
are normally much 
larger). It basically 
blends pixels together 
that contrast. Not 
a bad solution for 
actual dust and 
scratches on scanned 
prints, but even a 
light application ren-
ders a tone mapped 
image pretty blurry. 
See the before and 
after in Figure 11-5.
 
✓ Median: The Median 
filter is sort of an 
averaging method 
that replaces pixels 
with the median 
value of pixels that 
surround them. This 
area can be large 
(resulting in a ton 
of blurring) or small 
(which still results 
in blurring, but not 
so much that you 
want to hurl). See 
the before and after 
in Figure 11-6.
Select and reduce
Applying noise reduction to an entire layer has its strengths and weaknesses. 
One big weakness is the fact that you might not need the same level of noise 
reduction across the image. This is definitely a factor for photos that contain 
a lot of texture and detail — trees, concrete, rocks, hair, and so forth. One 
method to get around this is to select the noisy areas first and then apply 
noise reduction to those specific areas. The drawback to this is that selecting 
complex areas with any metaphysical degree of certitude is often very hard, 
which means you’ll end up with compromises, or it will take forever.

226
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Figure 11-7 shows an image taken from a bridge. The iron latticework makes 
for a tough selection. I’ve tried to select areas I want to reduce noise in with 
the Magic Wand, and the result is poor.
On the other hand, there’s not much difference between selecting areas versus 
erasing them in Elements (as part of blending) or using a mask in Photoshop. 
The supreme advantage to a mask, of course, is being able to change the 
masked area after the fact. After all, after you delete something, it’s gone.
 
For me, the tiebreaker comes down to a desire to keep noise reduction iso-
lated to separate layers, and blending the results afterward.
Figure 11-7: Selecting complex areas first is fraught with difficulties.
Masked reduction
The next step up the ladder of sophistication is masked (or erased) noise 
reduction. This works very well for landscape shots with a good deal of sky 
and possibly water. Here’s how:
 
1. Duplicate the layer you want to make the adjustment on.
 
2. Choose Filter➪Noise➪Reduce Noise.
 
3. From the Reduce Noise dialog box, choose the noise reduction options 
you want (refer to the earlier section, “Global noise smackdown”) and 
then click OK.
 
4. Make sure the reduce noise layer is active, and then erase the areas 
you don’t want noise reduction applied to.
 
 You can choose a few different methods to erase areas from the noise 
reduction layer. This blends the reduction in with layers below that 
have no noise reduction applied.
 
• Select and delete. Switch to your favorite selection method, select 
areas to erase, and then delete them.

227
 Chapter 11: Cleaning Up Your Photos
 
• Select, invert, and delete. Sometimes it’s easier to select the oppo-
site areas. For example, the sky tends to benefit from noise reduc-
tion much more than trees and the ground. In this scenario, using 
the Magic Wand to select areas to delete (trees and the ground) is 
almost impossible because those areas have too much texture and 
variability. It’s far easier to use the Magic Wand to select the sky, 
invert the selection (choose Selection➪Inverse), and delete.
 
• Erase. Switch to the Eraser and erase the areas of the layer you 
don’t want to see.
 
 Elements offers a few different erasers. The standard Eraser is 
manual mode. There are also the Background Eraser and the Magic 
Eraser. The Background Eraser erases material similar to where 
you first click and erase in the image — it assumes you are erasing 
the background. The Magic Eraser acts like the Magic Wand. Click 
an area you want to delete, and presto! — it’s gone!
 
• Opt for the combo platter. I normally switch to the Lasso and 
quickly outline areas I want to delete, as shown in Figure 11-8. 
The trees and buildings in this scene I’m selecting don’t need 
noise reduction, so they can be deleted from this layer. The layer 
beneath — the Background in this case — shows through and pre-
serves their sharpness. This is a rough selection. No need to spend 
an inordinate amount of time on it.
 
 I then use 
the Eraser in 
Brush mode 
to fine-tune 
the border, as 
shown in Figure 
11-9, changing 
brushes to suit 
the conditions. Don’t let 
yourself get too wrapped 
up in precision here. 
It’s important not to be 
sloppy, but the border 
doesn’t need to be exact. 
That’s the beauty of blend-
ing. I go over the lines a 
bit into the sky to make 
sure the edges of the trees 
aren’t softened, and I just 
don’t worry about the part 
of the sky that gets erased.
 
 One big (and negative) difference between Elements and Photoshop 
rears its head when you try to figure out how to alter a brush’s hardness 
Figure 11-8: Quickly selecting areas to delete.
Figure 11-9: Cleaning up the border.

228
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
in Elements. You can’t (for most, that is — the Background Eraser and 
Healing Brush are two exceptions).
 
 Change hardness for the normal Eraser in Elements by selecting differ-
ent brushes or switching the Eraser mode from Brush to Pencil or Block. 
 
5. Perform a merged copy (see Chapter 10) and continue working.
 
 This consolidates the effects of the blend into one solid layer.
Multiple masked reduction
The pinnacle of noise reduction methodology is to apply tailored noise 
reduction levels to specific areas of the image by using multiple layers and 
masks (or the Eraser, in the case of Elements). Although that sounds com-
plicated, I think you’ll find the most you’ll ever practically need is two levels 
of noise reduction, possibly three. If you see other parts of the image you 
want to try different levels of noise reduction on, duplicate the last un-noise-
reduced layer you have and apply a different amount of noise reduction to 
the newly duplicated layer.
Figure 11-10 shows three noise reduction layers being finished. Apply the 
noise reduction first; then delete what you don’t need out of each layer. 
Remember, the three layers have different noise reduction strength. More 
for the ceiling, less for the walls, and just a bit for the floor.
Figure 11-10: Erasing unneeded areas.

229
 Chapter 11: Cleaning Up Your Photos
Arrange the noise reduction layers 
so the areas you have applied the 
noise reduction to are visible and 
don’t conflict with each other. In 
Figure 11-11, the three areas don’t 
overlap. Notice that when all the 
noise reduction layers are on, there 
is still quite a bit of transparent 
areas. That’s because those areas 
have no noise reduction at all.
After you get your noise reduc-
tion layers finalized, turn on the 
Background layer (or the next layer 
underneath) and create a merged copy to lock the adjustments onto 
one layer.
We Have the Technology: Cloning
Cloning is one of the most important techniques you should master if you want 
total control over your HDR images. I realize that makes it sound like you’re 
some sort of evil super-genius bent on taking over the world. It isn’t that scary. 
Basically, it means you’re not held hostage by dust and other distractions.
Ye olde feather duster
Dust, while not always a problem, is certainly an irritant with dSLRs. The 
problem is caused by constantly removing and reattaching lenses. Without 
the lens on, dust floats through the hole where it was mounted and gets on 
the sensor. Even if you never take off the lens, the cameras aren’t air-tight.
Dust, which shows up as big blobs on photos, is most noticeable in the sky 
or other light, evenly toned areas. You might not see it (hence, it won’t be a 
problem) in more complex areas of your image, such as in trees and grass.
I use the Spot Healing Brush as my feather duster in most situations:
 
1. Duplicate the layer you want to make the adjustment on.
 
2. Select the Spot Healing Brush and set the size large enough to cover 
the dust.
 
3. Paint over the dust spot with a circular motion.
Figure 11-11: Arranged and visible — noise 
reduction layers blend together.

Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
 
 Wax on, wax off, as shown in Figure 11-12. Notice that I’m brushing just 
enough to cover the spot. When you release the mouse button, the new 
material is applied. Make sure to check that it’s okay. There is another 
dust spot (you can see them most clearly in the sky) to the left of the 
one I am removing.

Result
Too much correction
Figure 11-12: Dusting with the Spot Healing Brush.
 
Sometimes the Spot Healing Brush mangles the texture of an area or pulls in 
unwanted material to cover the spot (see the final panel of Figure 11-12). It 
should be obvious. When this happens, undo and repeat. Or, if you need 
more control, switch to the Healing Brush or use the Clone Stamp tool.
Removing distractions
Dust isn’t the only thing you’ll want 
to remove from your photos. Other 
distracting objects can take atten-
tion away from the subject or make 
the scene less than desirable. Notice 
the large shadow to the left in Figure 
11-13? Nuke it.
 
The Spot Healing Brush is too large 
and unwieldy to use. After all, it’s not 
a spot. Switch to the Clone Stamp 
tool — but that’s not all. Create a 
new, empty layer and name it clone. 
Use this layer to apply the new mate-
rial to. This is yet another way to blend. If you don’t like the job, you’re not 
stuck. You can switch to the Eraser and erase the changes you just made, 
and then start over.
Change the size of the Clone Stamp tool to cover a reasonable amount of space. 
You don’t want it too small, or it will take forever. Nor do you want it too 
large — that makes your fixes easier to spot. Nor do you want it too hard —

that makes the edges too easy to 
spot. You want it juuust right.
Select the Sample All Layers check 
box (on the toolbar) and make sure 
that the empty clone layer is active. 
This is the layer you want to paint 
on. Alt-click (Windows)/Option-click 
(Mac) to set the source location, and 
then paint over the destination; see 
this in action in Figure 11-14.
 
Select a new source area regularly. 
Mix it up, but pay attention. If the 
texture and tones don’t match, the 
replacement will be visible for all 
to see. You want it to be hidden 
(see the result in Figure 11-15). In 
addition, you don’t want features 
to repeat. In this case, if you can 
see the same rocks over and over, 
start over.
Not everything is as complicated as 
a shadow on rocks. The left panel 
of Figure 11-16 shows an irritating 
yellow-green light in a line of trees 
at dusk. Using the Clone Stamp tool, 
select an area beside the source and 
then paint over the light (the right 
panel of the figure). It gets pretty 
easy with practice.

Not all cloning is cosmetic. The left panel of Figure 11-17 shows an area on a 
building that has color bleed from a banner to the building surface. This is 
a tone mapping oddity. To remove it, select the Clone Stamp tool and move 
into an unaffected area (one building block down in the image) to select the 
source area. See the result on the right side of the figure.
Figure 11-17: Cloning sometimes solves tone mapping problems.
Fixing Lens Distortions
Look at something with straight lines. It could be your computer monitor, 
tiles on your bathroom wall, bricks, a fence, or graph paper taped to your 
wall. Are the lines straight? They should be. Now take a photograph of the 
same scene and examine whether the lines are straight in the photo or not. 
Most likely, they won’t be — even if you’re using a very expensive lens and 
camera. You’re seeing distortion in action.
Distortion happens when something that should be straight appears curved 
in your photographs. There are three types of lens distortion, as well as two 
types of distortion caused by how you hold the camera:
 
✓ Lens
 
• Barrel: The center of the image bulges out. (See Figure 11--18.)

233
 Chapter 11: Cleaning Up Your Photos
Barrel
Figure 11-18: A bad case of barrel distortion.
 
• Pincushion: The center of the image is pinched inward.
 
• Combination: Uneven distortion of either type (barrel or pincush-
ion) that generally looks worse in the center but tapers off to 
almost straight by the edges of the image.
 
✓ Camera position
 
• Vertical: When vertical lines aren’t straight, you have vertical 
distortion. This happens when you point the camera up or down, 
which causes vertical lines to either fall away or toward you, 
respectively. See examples of vertical distortion in Figure 11-19.
 
• Horizontal: When horizontal lines aren’t parallel to the ground, 
you have horizontal distortion. This happens when you point the 
camera left or right of the lines, which causes horizontal lines to 
cant one way or the other.

234
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Figure 11-19: Vertical distortion.
To fix lens distortion, choose Filter➪Correct Camera Distortion. In the 
Correct Camera Distortion dialog box that opens, as shown in Figure 11-20, 
there are several convenient options to choose:
 
✓ Remove Distortion: Repairs barrel (positive values correct bulging by 
pushing the center in) or pincushion (negative values correct pinching 
by pulling the center out) distortion. Notice the fairly large positive 
value I’m using here: This helps straighten out the lamppost (com-
pared against the left panel of Figure 11-18).
 
 Use the grid lines (select the Show Grid check box at the bottom of the 
dialog box) to line things up (as shown in Figure 11-20), or turn the grid 
off to see the image better. You can change the color of the grid, plus 
zoom in and out.
 
✓ Vignette: Lightens (positive values) or darkens (negative values) the 
corners of the image. Use to correct or cause vignetting. Adjust the 
Midpoint slider to change how little or how much the vignetting extends 
into the image.

235
 Chapter 11: Cleaning Up Your Photos
Figure 11-20: Correcting camera distortion.
 
✓ Vertical Perspective: Adjust to make vertical lines vertical. Notice the large 
value in this example. This was necessary to make the lamppost vertical.
 
✓ Horizontal Perspective: Adjust to make horizontal lines horizontal.
 
✓ Angle: Straightens the image.
 
✓ Scale: Enlarges the image. The one caveat here is that unlike trans-
forming the image in the main window, you lose whatever extends 
beyond the dialog box preview window. In other words, it crops after it 
enlarges. For this reason, I never use Scale. (I show it in this example, 
however, so you can compare with the previous image and see the 
overall effect of the transformation.)
To illustrate the effect, Figure 11-21 shows what happens when you add 
vignetting. If your images come out of tone mapping like this, correct it here. 
Not all vignetting is bad — some can look artistic. Notice, too, barrel and ver-
tical distortion are corrected, the grid lines are off, and the image was scaled 
upward a bit to make it appear full-screen.

Solving Color and Saturation Problems
When you shoot color photographs, it stands to reason that you’ll occasion-
ally run into color problems — in fact, a lot of the time. I can’t discuss all the 
different ways to address color in Photoshop Elements (and other programs) 
here. However, I want to show a few common problems and possible solu-
tions (note the terminology — you can often use one of several techniques 
successfully).
Oversaturation
Oversaturation means having too much color. It’s too intense. Most often, 
you’ll see this reflected in a general hue, such as purple or red. The left panel 
of Figure 11-22 illustrates the base of a lamppost at sunset. It’s got far too 
much red in it.
Adjust oversaturation by choosing Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Hue/
Saturation. From the Hue/Saturation dialog box, choose the problem color 
from the drop-down list (it defaults to Master) and then reduce the satura-
tion until the color looks right, as shown in the right panel of Figure 11-22.
 
Did you notice that the sunset doesn’t look as good after the desaturation? 
Use the blending techniques to isolate the desaturated area to the lamppost.

237
 Chapter 11: Cleaning Up Your Photos
Figure 11-22: Selective desaturation solves the problem.
Color casts
Color cast is a type of color problem that happens a lot, and you might not 
even be aware of it. There are several ways to combat the problem: Levels 
(to adjust white balance), removing color cast, and photo filters.
The left panel of Figure 11-23 shows a tile wall where the color is off — 
the whites are too warm. Use Levels to correct the white balance. Choose 
Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪Levels. In the Levels dialog box, as shown in the 
right panel of Figure 11-23, click the right-most eyedropper and click some-
thing in the image that should be white. What was not white automatically 
becomes white (theoretically, it’s a little like playing the lottery sometimes).
Figure 11-23: Correcting white balance with Levels.

238
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
That one was obvious. The next example (Figure 11-24) isn’t. In the top-
left panel of the figure, the ceiling should be white. It isn’t. In this case, try 
Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Remove Color Cast. From the dialog box that opens, 
click to select a black, gray, or white object in the photo.
 
That part takes a bit of trial and error. Try clicking different places of the 
image until you get the right color. You can see the result in the top-right 
panel of the figure here.
The next example shows the power of photo filters. You can use them to cool 
or warm an image. The left panel in Figure 11-25 (all these are tone mapped 
HDR images, by the way) is too warm. In other words, it looks too yellow-red. 
As a fix, choose Filter➪Adjustments➪Photo Filter to try out photo filters. 
The options in the Photo Filter dialog box (the right panel of the figure) are 
pretty intuitive: Choose a filter type based on the description or a solid color 
and then choose a density to apply to the filter. In this case, I applied a cool-
ing filter (visually, blues cool and reds warm an image) and tinkered with the 
density to get the right strength. The result looks pretty good.
Figure 11-24: Automatically remove the color cast.

Levels and Lightness
If you have brightness problems, 
use Levels as a good way to 
brighten or darken an image. 
Figure 11-26 shows a scene that 
came out of tone mapping a bit 
too dark. Not to worry. You don’t 
have to fret over problems like 
this in tone mapping because you 
have a good chance of fixing them 
in editing.
Choose Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪
Levels to open the Levels dialog 
box, as shown in Figure 11-27. To 
lighten an image, drag the white 
triangle under the main histogram 
(the graph) to the left, as shown. 
To darken an image, drag the black 
triangle to the right. Drag the gray 
triangle to move midtones up (dark-
ens) or down (lightens).
Figure 11-26: A dark stairway.

240
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
Figure 11-27: Brightening with Levels.
You can achieve very similar results 
by using a simpler method of adjust-
ing brightness and contrast from 
the Brightness/Contrast dialog 
box (Enhance➪Adjust Lighting➪
Brightness and Contrast). Just use 
the two sliders there, as shown in 
Figure 11-28. The downside of this 
approach is that it lightens or 
darkens every pixel, which may or 
may not be what you want.
Smoothing Rough Spots
Rough spots (see Figure 11-29) happen in tone mapping when you have 
motion that oscillates. This is most obvious in plants, trees, and water, where 
subtle back-and-forth movement is captured by bracketed exposures.
Figure 11-28: Brighten and add contrast.

241
 Chapter 11: Cleaning Up Your Photos
 
You can’t correct rough spots 
while you generate the HDR image 
or during tone mapping. I find the 
best solution is to smooth these 
areas as I edit. I do this at the point 
in my workflow where I would other-
wise clone.
Here’s how to smooth these spots to 
make them less distracting:
 
1. Duplicate the layer you want to 
make the adjustment on.
 
 See Chapter 10 for my rationale 
on working with different layers.
 
2. Zoom in to see the problem 
closely.
 
3. Select the Blur tool.
 
 This tool looks like a water droplet and is located with the Sharpen and 
Smudge tools, near the bottom of the toolbar.
 
4. Adjust tool characteristics.
 
 Set the size and strength to fit the nature of the problem.
 
5. Brush the problem area.
 
 Use the Blur tool to brush the edges of the rough spot to blend it in with 
the surroundings.
 
6. Continue working with your image.
Turning Your Images Loose: Publishing
Publishing or printing your photo is the final step in the HDR process. Snap 
on your chinstrap, fire up Elements, and get going:
 
1. (Optional) Enter file info by choosing File➪File Info and entering any 
file and copyright information you wish. Then save the final working 
copy as a Photoshop Elements (.psd) file.
 
2. Choose File➪Duplicate to create an identical copy of the Photoshop 
file, and then close the original.
 
 This step is for safety so that you don’t accidentally save and overwrite 
the layered Photoshop file and lose all your work.
Figure 11-29: Rough tone mapping spots.

242
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
 
3. Make sure the right layers are visible, and then choose Layer➪
Flatten Image.
 
4. Save the image as a high-resolution TIFF by choosing File➪Save As.
 
 For archival and printing purposes, save the image as a high-resolution 
(that is, unresized) TIFF. I always append the term -final to these 
TIFFs so that I can differentiate them from the tone mapped images that 
come from Photomatix Pro. Accept the default save settings unless you 
have reasons for changing them.
 
 If you want to print your image, send this TIFF to a commercial photo 
printer or print the image on your own home printer.
 
5. If you want to create a JPEG to post on the Web, resize the image by 
choosing Image➪Resize➪Image Size.
 
 Although you can jump ahead to Step 11 and choose File➪Save for Web, 
that routine is not optimized for large files, and you will get a warning to 
that effect. I find it best if I resize at this point.
 
6. In the Image Size dialog box (shown in Figure 11-30), select the 
Resample Image check box if it isn’t already checked.
 
7. Select a resampling method 
from the drop-down list at the 
bottom of the dialog box:
 
• Nearest Neighbor: 
Preserves hard edges. 
This definitely does what 
it says. Pay careful atten-
tion when you use this 
method. Examine the 
edges at 100% magnifi-
cation to look for any 
jaggedness from the 
sharp edges.
 
• Bilinear: A good method. 
The colors are good, and 
the image is smooth. You 
lose a bit of sharpness, 
however.
 
• Bicubic: Best for smooth gradients. Similar results to Bilinear but a 
bit sharper.
 
• Bicubic Smoother: Best if you’re enlarging the image. When reducing, 
this method looks almost indistinguishable from plain ’ol Bicubic.
 
• Bicubic Sharper: Best if you’re reducing the image size. Distinctly 
sharper than all the other methods. Use this method or sharpen 
after you reduce the image to its final size to preserve the effects.
Figure 11-30: Preparing to resize.

243
 Chapter 11: Cleaning Up Your Photos
 
8. In the Pixel Dimensions section, select Pixels from the Width and 
Height drop-down lists, and enter new pixel dimensions in the Width 
text box. Then click OK.
 
 If the Constrain Proportions check box is selected, you need to enter 
only one dimension, and the other will automatically be calculated and 
set by Elements.
 
 For moderately sized Web galleries, 800 pixels is a good width to start 
with. If you want something larger, head on up toward 1024 pixels wide. 
(If your photo is in portrait orientation, enter the dimension in the 
Height text box instead.)
 
9. (Optional) Add a text or graphic watermark.
 
 If you have a watermark to copyright your work, add it as a layer now. 
I put my name in the bottom-right corner of the image. I set up a helper 
file that has my name already entered, complete with a green block to 
help me align it (see Figure 11-31). I open this image and drag the layers 
(they are linked) to the HDR image, as shown in the figure. I then close 
the helper file and reposition the name to the corner. I then hide or 
delete the green block (green so I can see that it’s there very easily) 
later. If you want your watermark to be less obvious, reduce its opacity.
Figure 11-31: Add a watermark as a layer.

244
Part III: The Soft(er)ware Side of HDR 
 
 Elements doesn’t let you create embedded watermarks unless you use 
the File➪Process Multiple Files workaround.
 
 Do not apply a watermark to your high-resolution final TIFF (created in 
Step 4). Save watermarking as one of the last steps before publishing so 
you can customize the size of the mark to your final output size.
 
10. (Optional) Add a frame or other decorative elements.
 
 An easy way to add a border is to choose Image➪Resize➪Canvas Size. 
In the Canvas Size dialog box, select the Relative check box, enter 
how much to extend the canvas in the New Size section (each side is 
increased by half the number you enter, totaling the full amount), and 
then select a color from the Canvas Extension Color drop-down list. 
Click OK. I do this step twice — first, I add a 4 pixel (px) increase with 
white, and then a 2px increase in black.
 
11. Choose File➪Save for Web.
 
 If you want all the EXIF data preserved, choose File➪Save As, choose the 
JPEG file format, and then click Save. At the next dialog box, enter the 
quality you want (you can probably leave the other options alone) and 
click OK.
 
 In the Save for Web dialog box (shown in Figure 11-32), follow these 
steps:
 
a. Select JPEG High from the Preset drop-down list.
 
b. Select a percentage from the Quality drop-down list. A lower per-
centage makes the file smaller (see the preview window for the 
estimated size given the current settings) but at the cost of quality. 
Select a higher percentage for, you guessed it, higher quality. The 
cost is a larger file size.
 
c. Zoom in (use the Zoom drop-down list in the bottom-left corner) to 
see whether the quality you chose works. I find that 80 is a good 
compromise. If you want no compromises, select 100.
 
d. Select the ICC Profile check box to save the image with the color pro-
file embedded. This is preferred because it gives a Web browser or 
other application the information it needs to accurately render the 
colors contained in the image.
 
12. When you’re ready, click OK. Choose a location and name; then 
click Save.
 
13. Close the TIFF without saving it.
 
 This is important. Do not to save the TIFF. After all, you resized it. 
If you make a mistake and overwrite it, you can go back to your 
Photoshop Elements file and re-create the TIFF. I’m a backup-to-the-
backup kind of guy.

Check. Are you done? Not quite. This part is 
about having some extra fun with your HDR 
images.
Chapter 12 shows you how to work around the 
limitations of your camera and create ultra-wide 
panoramas in HDR. You ﬁ nd out how to break the 
scene up into pieces, photograph them, then turn 
the separate shots into bona-ﬁ de HDR images and 
stitch them together to create a seamless compos-
ite. Chapter 13 shows you several ways to turn a 
color image into black and white. Although it 
might sound goofy — taking color photos with a 
digital camera to turn into HDR images only to 
take the color out — it’s actually a great way to 
showcase some of your photos and create power-
ful, dramatic shots. You also see how to colorize a 
black-and-white image to make it look old, odd, or 
just awesome.

F
ind some room to move around. This chapter starts out a bit like an 
aerobics class.
Look straight ahead and stretch your arms straight in front of you. Keeping 
them straight, pull your arms back (like opening a double door) until you 
can’t see them anymore. Still looking straight ahead, bring your arms back 
forward until they just come back into your field of vision. Keeping your arms 
in position, look to the left and right to see where they are. This 
exercise (pun intended) shows you what human eyes see pan-
oramically, which is a pretty wide angle of view — about 
120 degrees or so, including peripheral vision. However, 
unless you’re working with a wide or ultra-wide angle 
lens, this isn’t what a camera sees, so photos don’t 
come close to this.
So how can you create panoramas? No need for 
fancy equipment. With any lens you have in your 
kit (even compact digital or super-zoom cameras 
work well for panoramas, as long as you can use 
them for HDR), you can create a single wide-angle 
image by merging multiple frames. Akin to HDR, 
you take more than one photo of a scene to create a 
single final image. Panoramas and HDR go well together: 
Panorama techniques extend your angle of view, and 
HDR captures a greater dynamic range of the scene. And this 
chapter is dedicated to helping you create exciting HDR panoramas, 
whether indoors or out.

250
Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
Shooting Panoramas in HDR
Shooting a panorama in HDR is the same as shooting a traditional panorama 
except that you take three to five times the number of photos. This takes into 
account brackets for each section of the panorama. You process the results 
as HDR images and then tone map them before you stitch the whole thing 
together as a panoramic view.
 The best way to start is to start:
 
1. Select a scene and configure your camera to shoot brackets for HDR.
 
 Have a look at Chapters 4 and 5 for more information or if your memory 
needs refreshed.
 
 Use whatever bracketing method your camera supports and that you’re 
comfortable with. You might not be able to use certain auto modes, 
depending on your camera. (See the next step.)
 
 You could conceivably shoot single-exposure HDR, but if you’re going to 
the trouble to set up a tripod (which you should) to shoot a panorama, 
you might as well go the whole mile and shoot the brackets, too. The 
exception to this might be scenes with moving subjects.
 
2. Tweak specific settings for panoramas.
 
 Ideally, you want your camera in completely 
manual mode (so white balance, focus, and 
the center exposure for the brackets don’t 
change willy-nilly), but this isn’t always 
possible. At a minimum, try these tweaks:
 
• White balance: Take white balance 
off Auto and set it to the conditions 
(sunlight, cloudy, and so on). This 
way, it won’t change from one frame to 
another even if the lighting is different. 
You want consistency across the entire 
panorama.
 
• Focus: Switch to manual focus to 
maintain a consistent depth of field 
(the focal point won’t move to and fro 
within the scene). Using auto focus can 
easily change from one frame of the 
panorama to the next; that’s bad.
 
3. Mount and level your camera on a tripod.

251
 Chapter 12: Creating Panor-Ahhh-Mas
 
 Don’t skip the leveling. You want your camera to rotate about an axis 
that is as true to vertical as you can get it. Rotate your camera and 
check that it stays level when you point it in a different direction.
 
4. Determine your framing strategy.
 
 Most people rush this step and just start shooting photos. Relax and 
take a few minutes to plan this. At a minimum, try for three frames. 
Center the subject of the panorama in the center frame, making sure to 
always have good overlap. If you need more than three frames and have 
a strong subject, center the subject as best you can in one frame and 
shoot the same number of frames on each side, balancing the panorama. 
Overlap shouldn’t be a problem with this scenario — you’ll have plenty.
 
 As you can see from Figure 12-1, the number of frames you need 
depends on the angle of view of your lens and the scene at hand. Wide 
and ultra-wide angle lenses require fewer shots to capture the same 
scene compared with lenses of longer focal lengths. In my example, the 
magic number of frames is four.
 
 Important: Try to overlap each frame by about one-third, as seen in 
Figure 12-2. Overlap helps the panorama program stitch (assemble) 
the frames by providing good reference points. The more reference 
points, the greater the possibility of a successful stitch in your assembly 
software.

Frame overlap
Figure 12-2: Plan for plenty of overlap.
 
5. Check the alignment of each shot.
 
 This can be a dry run where you don’t take the photos, or you can go 
ahead and shoot them. Doesn’t really matter. The important part is 
checking out landmarks that help you identify the boundaries of your 
frames and how much overlap you’ll get.
 
 As you can see from Figure 12-3, trees make outstanding landmarks. 
In fact, anything that stands out from the background — and vertical 
objects seem to work best — serves as a landmark.
 
 If you have a tripod with a compass, you can make a note of the reading 
for the center point of each frame.
 
 Take a few meter readings along the way to see whether exposure 
varies from one side of the panorama to the other. HDR is more forgiv-
ing than single-exposure panoramas because of the brackets (the point 
of HDR, really).
 
 Make sure you capture as much dynamic range of the scene as possible 
while not blowing out any highlights. Decide on a final exposure. If in 
extreme doubt, shoot a bracketed panorama with one central exposure 
(the 0.0 EV point); then capture another with different settings.

253
 Chapter 12: Creating Panor-Ahhh-Mas
 
6. Pan to the right-most frame and double-check the exposure.
Landmarks
Figure 12-3: Look for landmarks to identify frame boundaries.
 
 Sure, you can start on the left if you want. There is no technical reason 
to shoot one way over another except personal preference. You can 
try to shoot the center frame first and then move left and right, but it’s 
more natural to shoot left-to-right or right-to-left.
 
 Make sure the exposure you decided on is dialed in and set.
 
 I recommend shooting in Manual mode so the camera can’t change the 
exposure. If you’re in a semi-auto or automatic mode, the camera can 
change settings every time you check exposure.
 
7. Shoot the first bracketed set (see Figure 12-4).

 Chapter 12: Creating Panor-Ahhh-Mas
Going the extra mile
Shooting panoramas is a whole ’nother world 
with its own set of specialized gear and tech-
niques. If you’re not shooting professionally, you 
don’t really need to worry about the differences 
between casual and professional panoramas. If 
you want the most professional results and the 
highest quality images, however, here are a few 
things you should do to up your game.
First, buy a dedicated panorama tripod head, 
which moves the axis of rotation from some-
where in the camera body (where the screw 
goes in using a normal tripod head) to a point 
that is the optical center of the lens. There is 
confusion about what this point is called: the 
no-parallax point, the entrance pupil, or the 
nodal point.
Shooting frames that revolve around the no-
parallax point reduces or eliminates parallax (a 
visual side effect where nearby objects move in 
relation to far objects between frames, like your 
finger moves against the background when you 
look at it with one eye, and then the other). You 
have to dial in this point by taking test shots and 
moving the camera forward or backward in the 
panorama head mount.
You can also change the orientation of your 
camera to vertical (portrait). This is easier to 
do on some tripod heads than others, but it’s a 
breeze if you have a panorama head. The ben-
efit of shooting portrait panoramas is having 
more photo to use after you stitch the images. 
You will be sure to capture enough area so that 
when you crop the final image, you won’t be 
forced to make incredibly painful decisions on 
what to lose. The downside is that you’ll have to 
shoot more frames from left to right, but that’s 
easier than shooting two rows or wider frames 
to capture the same area.
Figure 12-8: The completed panorama.

256
Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
Processing Panoramas As HDR
Taking the photos is only the first part of creating a panorama. Now you need 
to process your shots as HDR images.
You can, of course, do this the hard way — prepare and tone map all your 
brackets manually. Depending on how many frames and brackets you have, 
that might take some time. Conservatively, you should have three frames 
of three brackets each (nine images). As a time-saver, take advantage of as 
much automated processing as possible.
Developing Raw photos in bulk
Not every Raw editor can process Raw photos automatically: Sony Image 
Data Converter, for example. Some, like Adobe Camera Raw, enable you to 
open all the images into the interface at once and apply one setting to every 
image. Much better.
If you use Adobe Lightroom or Apple Aperture (see Figure 12-9, where I have 
selected three random photos of hash browns to illustrate this concept), 
you can select multiple Raw files and export them as TIFFs, or use the Quick 
Develop tool in Lightroom as a pseudo-batch processor before you export.
Figure 12-9: Exporting hash browns for breakfast.

257
 Chapter 12: Creating Panor-Ahhh-Mas
Other applications, like Nikon Capture NX 2, have full-featured batch routines 
that make it possible to process every exposure in an HDR panorama with-
out opening them all up. Batch-processing Raw images is also addressed in 
Chapter 9.
 
To ease the processing burden on your computer, convert Raw photos to 
8-bit TIFFs or JPEGs. Yes, you’ll suffer a bit of a quality hit, but if the photos 
are well taken, it won’t be noticeable with the 8-bit TIFF — and JPEGs might 
look fine, too.
Creating an HDR master frame
The most efficient way to proceed with HDR is to create a master, tone 
mapped frame and use that as the template to process the other frames 
of the panorama in HDR. (HDR and tone mapping information is more fully 
covered in Chapters 7–9.) After you create the master frame, you have the 
settings you need to plug into your HDR application’s batch routine. This 
also ensures consistency across the 
panorama. You don’t want to use one 
set of HDR options and tone mapping 
settings for one frame of the pan-
orama and a completely different set 
for the next.
Thankfully, creating a master frame is 
exactly like generating an HDR image 
from normal brackets and tone map-
ping it in your HDR application. Figure 
12-10 illustrates creating the master 
frame HDR image. This is used to tone 
map the master frame — which can 
then be discarded. The only reason to 
do this is to get the settings you want 
in a file.
 
Next, tone map the master frame. 
This is necessary to find what set-
tings you want applied to the entire 
panorama. Then save the settings.
 
Mac users: Save your tone map-
ping settings when you save the file. 
This takes an extra step. Windows 
users can check a box on the Save As 
dialog box and have Photomatix Pro 
always save the settings with the file 
(very handy, that is).
Figure 12-10: Create the HDR master frame 
image.

Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
Batch-processing the rest
With your master frame completed, batch-process the rest of the panorama. 
Here’s how in Photomatix Pro, after you process your Raw images (if neces-
sary; discussed earlier) and then create and tone map the master frame (as 
shown earlier and in Chapters 7–9). Your goal is a settings file that can be used 
during batch processing. You don’t even need to save the tone mapped image.
 
1. Organize the source images in a new folder.
 
 You can use JPEGs, 8-bit TIFFS, or 16-bit TIFFs. It’s up to you. I find it 
easiest to identify an entire folder to perform batch processing on. This 
keeps things separate so you’re assured of processing the images you 
want and not others. And I always keep original Raw photos in a safe 
place, well away from Raw editors and HDR applications.
 
2. Create a destination folder.
 
3. In Photomatix Pro in the Workflow Shortcuts window (this window 
should automatically appear when you run Photomatix Pro), click the 
Batch Processing button.
 
 You use the Batch Processing of Differently Exposed Images dialog box 
to enter all the information required to automatically create the HDR 
and tone map all the images for your panorama. Pretty cool.
 
 See Chapter 9 for detailed steps to batch-process the images for your 
panorama.
 
4. Select the Tone Map with Details Enhancer check box and then click 
the Settings button.
 
 You’re presented 
with a tone mapping 
settings dialog box. 
 
5. Although you can 
enter the settings 
manually, click 
the Load button; 
in the Load Tone 
Mapping Settings 
from and XMP File 
dialog box, select 
the master frame 
tone mapping set-
tings XMP file, and 
then click the Load 
button, as shown in 
Figure 12-11.
Figure 12-11: Select the saved master frame tone mapping 
settings.

259
 Chapter 12: Creating Panor-Ahhh-Mas
 
 This is where creating the master frame tone mapping settings file 
pays off.
 
 The rest of the steps to batch-process images are identical to those 
given in Chapter 9.
Figure 12-12 shows the final panorama, edited and cropped. You can see from 
this figure how important it is to have the same settings applied to each frame 
of the panorama. Otherwise, you would easily be able to tell where one frame 
ends and the other begins. Your goal, after all, is seamlessness.
Figure 12-12: This nice line of trees is actually in a semi-circle.
Stitching the Elements Together
Time to stitch the tone mapped images. Panoramas don’t just merge them-
selves, you know. You need to use specialized software algorithingamajigs to 
combine separate images into a cohesive whole. Photoshop Elements offers 
Photomerge, and Photoshop has a very similar capability (coincidentally, 
also called Photomerge — maybe the lawyers should look into that).
Stitching in Photoshop Elements
Stitching panoramas together in Photoshop Elements isn’t that hard. You 
might need a few run-throughs before you get totally comfortable with it, but 
it’s mostly automated.
 
Elements is a little goofy when it comes to working with 16-bit images. If you 
open tone mapped files that are 16 bits per channel, Elements prompts you 
to convert the bit depth before you begin. However, Photomerge gets stuck 
after the first image and refuses to continue opening and stitching images 
together (no matter how many times you curse at it), so it’s rather pointless. 
Instead, open 16-bit images in Elements and convert them to 8 bits (when 
you save them, consider renaming the files if you want to preserve the 16-bit 
images for some other purpose), or save the tone mapped images as 8-bit 
JPEGs or TIFFs directly from your HDR application.

260
Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
After you have all the brackets you want to stitch together into a panorama 
saved as 8-bit images, follow these steps:
 
1. Open Photoshop Elements and start Photomerge by choosing File➪
New➪Photomerge Panorama.
 
 As Figure 12-13 shows, the Photomerge dialog box appears, beckoning 
you toward panoramic greatness.
Figure 12-13: The Photomerge dialog box.
 
2. Click the Browse button, and in the Open dialog box that appears, 
browse to the folder containing the tone mapped frames of the pan-
orama, select them, and then click OK.
 
 The Open dialog box closes, and the selected files appear in a new, 
untitled image document as a stitched panorama.
 
3. Choose a layout by selecting one of the radio buttons in the Layout 
section of the Photomerge dialog box.
 
• Auto: You’re telling Elements to go for it, allowing it to choose 
between Perspective and Cylindrical layouts.
 
• Perspective: The center of the panorama remains unchanged, and 
the outer areas are distorted so that horizontal lines parallel to the 
ground remain parallel to the ground.

261
 Chapter 12: Creating Panor-Ahhh-Mas
 
 The major side effect of this layout is the “bow-tie effect,” in which 
the center of the panorama looks normal, but the corners are heav-
ily distorted. You lose this area when you crop the final image. 
Figure 12-14 shows what happens when perspective goes bad. This 
is how you know to choose another method. Elements can’t prop-
erly configure this panorama as a perspective.
Figure 12-14: Won’t you take me to (daah, da dat) (wait for it) Funky Town?
 
• Cylindrical: This projection eliminates the bow-tie effect on the cor-
ners and results in a panorama where the corners aren’t distorted up 
and out. In fact, the corners are allowed to do the opposite — that is, 
creep in. Figure 12-15 shows that the sky can balloon up. Everything 
that isn’t a nice, tidy rectangle gets cropped out at the end.
 
• Reposition Only: This layout aligns each frame (based again on 
matching reference points) but does not transform them in any way.
 
 This option, contrary to what you might think (we often fall prey 
to the notion that correcting for perspective is always better), 
can produce very good-looking panoramas that do not suffer from 
undue amounts of distortion. Figure 12-16 illustrates this layout in 
action. Overall, it looks good, but the horizon looks too wavy to 
me. I favor Cylindrical for this panorama.

262
Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
Figure 12-15: Ah, that’s better.
Figure 12-16: Repo-sition, man.
 
• Interactive Layout: This is the do-it-yourself option, as shown 
in Figure 12-17. Elements opens a lightbox with your panorama 
stitched for you (the images it can do so automatically, at any 
rate), and gives you the control to override the existing layout.
 
 You can zoom in and out, click and drag frames to reposition them, 
rotate individual frames, and change the settings from Reposition 

263
 Chapter 12: Creating Panor-Ahhh-Mas
Only to Perspective. If you select the Perspective radio button, you 
can even set the Vanishing Point of the image.
Figure 12-17: Laying it out in the lightbox.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 Elements aligns and processes the images and eventually creates the 
panorama as a new image. Each frame occupies a separate layer, with 
portions masked (hidden) to blend together well. Note: This is one of the 
few times Elements allows you to work with masks.
 
5. Save your panorama!
 
 I find it best to save the raw panorama as a Photoshop file (.psd) now 
for future reference before I tweak frame blending and make other 
adjustments. Then I save the finalized panorama image as a separate file.
Blending the frames with layer masks
Blending allows you to tweak how Elements masked the different layers and 
then stitched them to create the composite image. This process is useful if 
something looks better on one frame of the panorama but that spot has been 
masked by Elements in favor of the same spot in another frame that doesn’t 
look as good. This requires some playing around.
 
Masks in Photoshop Elements (and other image editors) make certain pixels 
transparent on a layer, allowing what’s on the next layer down to show 
through. Look ahead to Figure 12-18 and check out the Layers palette — the 
black and white blobs are the masks on those layers. The black parts are 

264
Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
transparent (so you see through to the layer underneath), and the white 
parts are “solid.” The great thing about masks is that you can use grays to 
make the corresponding parts of that layer partially transparent, which for 
this chapter means that you can create smooth blending of the transitions 
between frames of the panorama. (Chapter 10 goes into more detail about 
using masks and layers for blending in HDR images.)
 
If you see a strong border where there is a mask, soften it by smoothing the 
mask edge. Or, if you like something on a layer that’s masked (a tree looks 
better in one frame than another, for example), unmask the better tree and 
mask over the tree in the other frames. It takes some practice to get the hang of 
it because you’re working in three dimensions. Where layers overlap each 
other, you can choose which layer you want to see by virtue of layer order and 
masking — just follow these steps:
 
1. Find the areas that don’t look quite right, and click the Eye icon to 
show and hide the layers to see where the borders are.
 
 Hint: You can erase 
or paint black or 
white onto the mask 
to enlarge, shrink, or 
soften it.
 
 Figure 12-18 shows 
a border that looks 
like trouble. You 
can see the edge 
between one frame 
and the next. This is 
a prime candidate 
for blending.
 
2. Click the layer mask 
you want to work 
with in the Layers 
palette.
 
 Make sure you select 
the mask — not the 
image. The mask has a 
white highlight around it when you secure 
it, as shown in Figure 12-19.
 
3. Click the small white-over-black box 
under the main color swatches to select 
the default foreground and background 
colors — then switch them by clicking 
the color-swap arrows above the back-
ground color swatch.
Figure 12-18: This border needs a-blending.

265
 Chapter 12: Creating Panor-Ahhh-Mas
 
 Oddly enough, Elements 8 
swapped these so that the 
default foreground is black and 
background is white. Ugh.
 
 This sets the foreground color to 
white and the background color 
to black — colors you’ll see when 
you start painting or erasing.
 
4. Select a tool (such as the Brush 
tool) to paint the mask. Paint 
with black (making those parts 
transparent) or white (making 
those parts solid).
 
 You can also use the Eraser tool 
if you don’t like switching between black and white. In Figure 12-20, I’m 
using the Eraser tool with a soft brush tip selected (which is important 
to keep the edges from being too harsh) to better blend it with the layer 
beneath. You might find it helpful to reduce the Opacity setting to 50% 
or so to avoid abrupt changes in tone.

Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
Cropping the finalized image
Cropping is a final step in creating your panorama, so you want to make sure 
you finish other edits first: Blend the transitions, sharpen, correct the color, 
improve contrast, reduce noise, and so on.
 
This workflow preserves your options longer. If you crop first, you’re stuck 
with it. If you want to go back and crop the panorama in a different way, you 
have to perform all the edits again to get back to the same place. So I recom-
mend that you first make all your edits, and then save the panorama as a 
working Photoshop Elements file. After you crop, save the image again (with 
a new name and type) as a final file to publish: for example, as a JPEG if you 
want to publish the image on the Web, or as a TIFF if you want to print it.
To crop your panorama, follow these steps:
 
1. Zoom out to see the entire panorama.
 
2. Select the Crop tool, and drag a border around the area you want to 
keep.
 
 Figure 12-21 shows the crop box positioned over the bottom part of the 
panorama. Unfortunately, there’s not much that can be done to rescue 
transparent areas. Cropping panoramas is a fact of life.
 
3. Zoom in to see more precisely and then adjust the crop borders to 
weed out any transparent pixels.

 Figure 12-22 shows the bottom-left corner of the panorama at high magni-
fication. The light areas show where the rough crop box was. I am moving 
it into the image so the crop box won’t have any transparent pixels.
 
4. Click the check mark (refer to Figure 12-21) to apply the crop.

Love panoramas? Check out PTGui!
PTGui (www.ptgui.com; $120 for the more 
basic version and $200 for PTGui Pro) is a pow-
erful all-in-one panorama application, dedicated 
to supporting specialized panorama features, 
such as customizable control points and sig-
nificantly more projection types as Photoshop 
Elements. (See the following figure.) If you want 
to control just about every conceivable part 
of the panorama process and are considering 
displaying or selling your panoramas profes-
sionally, PTGui is for you. PTGui allows you to 
enter information about the camera and lens, 
and enables you to edit the stitched-together 
frames in the Panorama Editor. PTGui gives you 
lots of options on controlling how the panorama 
looks, how the frames fit together, and how 
they’re aligned.
PTGui has a developed following and robust 
support system on the Web. If you’re serious 
about creating HDR panoramas, download 
either or both trial versions and have a closer 
look for yourself. The Pro version even has its 
own HDR and tone mapping features.

H
DR in black and white? I can hear the exclamations from here. Why go 
to all that trouble to photograph multiple brackets of a scene, lovingly 
tone map it, and then throw away all that hard-earned color data? Why, 
for heaven’s sake, take a modern digital camera with more com-
puting power in it than the Apollo moon program and go so 
freakishly retro? Why? You’re just fooling yourself! You 
take the photo in color, generate the HDR in color, tone 
map it in color, and then pretend to create a black-
and-white “photograph.” It’s all nonsense!
Yes. Yes. Yes, and yes. It is.
Black-and-white HDR photography is a lot like love. 
Yes, love. You can rarely explain it, and it’s hardly 
logical. I love thee, because thou satisfiest the ratio-
nal in me. Pshaw. Black-and-white HDR photography 
satisfies the creative artist bent on love in all of us. 
We love it because it is, and that’s what this chapter is 
about: describing it a bit, and then showing you how to 
turn your HDR photos into spectacular black and white.

270
Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
Seeing That Special Something
In general, you should convert an HDR photo to black and white for the 
same reasons you would convert any other photo. Those reasons boil down 
to aesthetics (it looks cool and makes a statement in black and white) or 
solving color problems (color has problems, so maybe black and white looks 
better). The difference is how the HDR tone mapping process gives you 
more to work with from the outset. You’ll have more contrast, more tone — 
more of everything — leaving you with a more interesting and powerful 
black-and-white image.
Analyze the photos in this section and see whether you agree with me that 
these images work as black and white as well or better than as color HDR. 
Hopefully, you’ll see why you should even bother because converting photos 
to black and white is another step to incorporate into your workflow.
Emphasizing contrast
HDR photography excels at emphasizing contrast — and not just in color but 
in black and white, too. Black-and-white photos are beautiful studies in con-
trast. With color removed from the photo, your eyes tune in to differences 
between black and white or light and dark much more readily. The result is a 
new and pleasing perspective.
Figure 13-1 is just such a case. The color photo, an interesting study in HDR, 
has a number of elements that pull your eyes away from the study of con-
trast: the inside, outside, the man sitting at the far end of the pavilion, picnic 
tables, and green of the trees versus the browns and grays inside. However, 
the same photo converted to black and white is a concentrated study in con-
trast. HDR accentuates details that make contrast more interesting, but the 
black-and-white conversion removes distractions.
Six degrees of black and white
Of the many ways to create black-and-white 
HDR, whatever method you choose and when 
you employ it depends on the applications you 
use and how much effort you want to put into 
it. Having said that, you can create pretty good 
results quickly and easily in most programs. So, 
all the fuss in this chapter comes down to degree.
In general, you’ll achieve the best results (and 
the greatest power to control the outcome) if 
you use Photoshop, Lightroom, or another appli-
cation that allows you to individually tweak the 
black and white tones.

271
 Chapter 13: Going Old School with Black-and-White HDR
Figure 13-1: The black-and-white version tells the story of contrast.
Reveling in tone
Some people live in a world of color. Things are azul, rojo, amarillo, anara-
njado, morado, or verde (a little Spanish there for ya). Tone isn’t that black 
and white. Tone, in fact, is a world with nuanced shades of gray. Figure 13-2 is 
a tough one. The color version of this shot is good with the chrome, the blue 
sky, and rusty dump truck. The part of this photo is boring (the color of the 
car) and lost in a sea of other details.

272
Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
Figure 13-2: Tones rock black-and-white photos.
 
In black and white, however, the story gels and becomes much more concen-
trated. It’s not about color anymore, but about the different levels of tone. 
These different components that make up the scene are no longer disjointed — 
thrown together by circumstance. They fit in a cohesive whole in black and 
white and tell a singular story.

273
 Chapter 13: Going Old School with Black-and-White HDR
Solving color problems
Sometimes color HDR photos just don’t look good. For whatever reason, Figure 
13-3, a single-exposure HDR image, is such a case. The color version, as you 
can see, just isn’t that interesting, even in HDR. The objects that draw your 
eyes are the line of green trees and the color markings on the Mustang. The 
clouds and tarmac aren’t captivating, and the aircraft itself is unremarkable.
 
In black and white, though, the photo explodes with interesting tones. The 
clouds and concrete are more interesting, and the silver of the plane has a 
gorgeous tone that was hidden in color. The color was removed, therefore, 
and replaced with shades of gray. The difference is astounding.
Figure 13-3: Black and white can solve color issues.

274
Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
Focusing on the subject
 
Black-and-white photos sometimes have the effect of bringing you closer to 
the subject of the photo. Depending on how you process it, you can accentu-
ate certain elements by lightening them, or reduce their importance by dark-
ening them. In Figure 13-4, the color HDR image suffers from an overly busy 
background that pulls attention off the subject (the tree and park bench). In 
the black-and-white version, though, the sky is darker and areas of the tree 
lighter. This pulls attention to the front-center of the photo and allows your 
eyes to explore the simple setting. Now the background is more appropri-
ately background.
Figure 13-4: This subject stands out better in black and white.
Converting Early in the HDR Process
One option to create black-and-white HDR images is to convert your color 
photos to black and white before using them to generate the HDR image. You 
have two options to choose from if this is the direction you want to go in:
 
✓ Convert during Raw conversion.
 
✓ Convert during tone mapping.

275
 Chapter 13: Going Old School with Black-and-White HDR
Using a Raw editor
If you convert during Raw conversion, you must shoot your images and 
brackets in Raw and be prepared to convert them to black and white in your 
favorite Raw converter. Depending on the strength of the application you 
use, you can have more or less control over the process.
 
If you shoot using JPEGs only, these methods (as they pertain to Raw photos) 
are not applicable to you.
Here are a few examples of the options you might have:
 
✓ Desaturation: This method certainly works, but you have no control over 
toning. Photoshop Elements (via Adobe Camera Raw) and certain Raw edi-
tors (such as the Sony Image Data Converter) 
offer this option. Sometimes, the only way to 
convert a photo to black and white is to com-
pletely desaturate it (in addition to altering its 
contrast, sharpness, and so forth).
 
✓ Cameraesque presets: Nikon’s Capture NX 2 has handy presets that 
enable you to convert a color photo to black and white. Choose a 
camera preset with filter (green, red, and so in) from the Color Mode 
drop-down list in the Picture Control palette, as shown in Figure 13-5. 
You can also convert Raw photos using New Additional Adjustments in 
NX 2 (at the bottom of the Edit List panel).
 
 Apple Aperture works the same way but also allows for a level of custom 
control.
Marching orders
If you’re wondering what order to do things 
in — you know, should you convert to black 
and white before or after you sharpen? Before 
or after you increase contrast? Before or after 
you transform, resize, reshape? — here’s my 
strategy. I tend to create the best color image 
I can, complete with sharpening, noise reduc-
tion, cloning, and any other adjustments I want 
to make. It’s done. Then I move to black and 
white. This way, if I decide I don’t like how the 
black-and-white image turned out, I don’t have 
to do everything all over again. I just pick up the 
finished color image and go back to the black-
and-white drawing board.
Your mileage may vary, but I have to think 
that all the obsession over creating the per-
fect workflow is often overrated from a quality 
perspective. Use the workflow that preserves 
quality, but also time.

276
Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
Figure 13-5: Choosing black and white presets.
 
✓ Robust black-and-white toning: Applications such as Photoshop and 
Adobe Lightroom both contain extensive black-and-white conversion 
routines. These are covered more fully later in the chapter, but you can 
see the Lightroom interface active in Figure 13-6. I am using the Develop 
tab to convert a Nikon Raw image to black and white.
Figure 13-6: More controls for a custom conversion.

277
 Chapter 13: Going Old School with Black-and-White HDR
 
If you want to convert your bracketed photos to black and white before 
processing them as HDR, apply the exact same settings to all images. This 
ensures a consistent conversion.
Desaturating while you tone map
You may also (depending on the options of your HDR application) convert an 
HDR image to black and white while you tone map. Conversion using a stan-
dard color saturation control is very simple. Reduce it to 0 and you’re done, as 
shown in Figure 13-7. Photomatix Pro has a few saturation options (different 
controls for highlights and shadows), but overall color intensity is controlled 
by the Color Saturation setting. Setting it to 0 turns the image to grayscale.
Figure 13-7: Desaturating in the HDR application.
 
Try tone mapping the color image until you reach the effect you’re after, and 
then reduce saturation to 0 to convert it to black and white. Alternatively, 
reduce Color Saturation to 0 first; then manipulate the other settings to 
achieve the best look for the image.
The downside to converting color HDR images to black and white at this 
stage is generally a loss of control. Color saturation settings are simple, and 
you have very few, if any, options to manage the tones you want.

278
Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
Converting a Tone Mapped HDR Image
There are a number of methods to convert a color, tone mapped image to 
black and white after the HDR process. Use your favorite image editor (in this 
case, I use Photoshop Elements and Photoshop).
Weighing in on the grayscale
Converting an image to grayscale is a very simple procedure. That’s the upside. 
The downside is that you have no control over the process. Contrary to what 
you may think, there is no appreciable difference between the total number of 
shades of gray in a grayscale image and one converted to black and white using 
the other methods in this chapter, as long as you’re comparing images at 8 
bits per channel. If you convert a 16-bit image to grayscale, the total number of 
shades rises to 32,768. (As an aside, grayscale is the technically correct term for 
black and white photography. The photos and images are made up of shades of 
gray. A true black-and-white image has only two colors — black and white.)
In Photoshop Elements, choose Image➪Mode➪
Grayscale. When prompted to throw the image’s 
color information away, click OK.
Desaturayayayayshun
Another simple technique to get 
a fast black-and-white image is 
by desaturation. You can accom-
plish this in Elements by choosing 
Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust 
Hue/Saturation and then reducing 
Saturation to 0 in the dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 13-8.
Using Convert to Black 
and White
Photoshop Elements has a handy 
Convert to Black and White feature 
that gives you some creative control 
over the process. It’s probably the 
most popular method to convert a 
color image to black and white in Elements.
Finish editing the image. This includes noise reduction, contrast enhancements, 
sharpening, and all other applicable steps shown in the workflow presented in 
Chapter 10. You should have a layer ready to convert to black and white.

To use the Convert to Black and White feature in Photoshop Elements, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose Enhance➪Convert to Black and White.
 
 The Convert to Black and White dialog box (see Figure 13-9) has the 
following sections:
Figure 13-9: Converting to black and white in Photoshop Elements.
Duplicating the background
I like duplicating the Background layer before I 
make any changes. This preserves the original, 
tone mapped image in the file and allows me to 
go back and start over if I need to. In Photoshop 
or Photoshop Elements, right-click the back-
ground layer and choose Duplicate Layer. 
Rename the new layer and continue.

• Preview: In the Before and After windows, see the effects of the 
settings you choose.
 
• Select a Style: From this handy list of presets, choose from styles 
that blend color information (intensity, not hue) from the three 
color channels. See a comparison in Figure 13-10.
 
• Adjustment Intensity: Use these sliders to adjust the percentage of 
each color channel (Red, Green, and Blue) used in the conversion. 
Ideally, they should add up to 100%, but you have some creative 
latitude. You can also alter contrast using the Contrast slider.
 
2. Make adjustments to the conversion by moving the Red, Green, Blue, 
and Contrast sliders. If you don’t like the results, click the Undo 
button. If you really mess up, click the Reset button to remove all your 
changes and start over.

 A little change goes a long way here. Too much, and the image will be 
white (too much intensity coming from one or all channels). Too little, 
and the image will be black. Over-accentuating contrast tends to poster-
ize the image, although that can sometimes be a cool artistic effect.
 
3. When you’re finished and want to approve the conversion, click OK.
 
 The image is converted and appears in the Elements workspace, as 
shown in Figure 13-11.

This isn’t the last stage of image processing. You’ll want to save your work, 
most likely as a Photoshop (.psd) file and continue editing. In particular, 
black-and-white images benefit from further contrast enhancements as well 
as dodging and burning. For more information on additional editing tech-
niques, see Chapters 10 and 11.
Using a gradient map
 
Most people don’t think of using gradient maps to convert images to black 
and white, but the results are very good. I happened across it quite by acci-
dent one day. The thought occurred to me, “If I ever write a book called High 

282
Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
Dynamic Range Digital Photography For Dummies and am working on a chapter 
entitled ‘Going Old School with Black-and-White HDR,’ then I need to use this!”
In Photoshop Elements, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Layer➪New Adjustment 
Layer➪Gradient Map to create 
an adjustment layer.
 
 This calls up the New Layer 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 
13-12. Click OK to continue.
 
2. If necessary, select a gradient from the 
Adjustments panel.
 
 If the gradient (you can see it in the 
Adjustments panel in Figure 13-13) runs from 
black to white, you don’t need to change it.
 
 If it’s something else, select Black, White 
from the Gradient Map drop-down list. 
(See Figure 13-14.)
 
3. Click OK to close the dialog box and apply 
the gradient map as an adjustment layer, as 
shown in Figure 13-15.
 
 If you don’t want the hassle of an adjustment 
layer, right-click the layers in the Layers 
palette and choose Merge Visible. This 
combines the layers into one. If you do want 
the hassle (say you want to come back and 
edit the adjustment), remember to make a 
merged copy to lock in the effect before you 
continue.
 
A Gradient Map is nothing more than a mask that 
turns everything beneath it to grayscale. You can 
create part color and part black-and-white images 
in Photoshop Elements by erasing areas of a 
Grayscale Map mask. Select the Eraser and make 
sure your background color is black (black areas 
of the mask allow the lower layer to show 
through unaffected). Click the mask to select it, 
and then erase areas on the image you want to 
remain in color. Make a mistake? Switch to the 
Brush with white as the foreground color, and 
paint white in the mask to reapply the black and 
white adjustment.

Working with Photoshop
 
Not surprisingly, Photoshop has a very powerful tool to convert color images 
to black and white. This is what I use because it gives me a significant degree 
of control over how the final image looks. You can turn blue skies dark, green 
grass light, red features gray, and so forth. It gives you a lot of creative free-
dom, and I’m all over that. You can also use Photoshop (and Elements) to 
colorize (tint) a black-and-white image at the end of conversion. Sweet. You 
can read about different ways to colorize later in the chapter in the “Using 
Elements to colorize” section.
To use it, ride this escalator:
 
1. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Black & White.
 
 In the Black and White dialog box that opens, there are many more 
options than in the Photoshop Elements method, but they work similarly.
 
2. (Optional) Select a preconfigured preset from the Preset drop-down list.
 
 Options include choices such as Darker, High Contrast Red Filter, and 
Yellow Filter. Scroll through the list, as seen in Figure 13-16, and find 
one you like.

3. Use the color sliders to alter color percentages.
 
 These six colors create the tonal mixture of the black and white. For 
example, increasing the amount with the Blues slider increases the inten-
sity of the blue channel during conversion, which lightens the resulting 
grayscale image. This makes skies, water, and other blue objects lighter.
 
 You can, therefore, lighten or darken specific areas of the black-and-
white image by increasing or decreasing the color percentage of one 
of the six colors. Choose the color that is dominant in the area you’re 
working in. (Make sure to select the Preview check box to see your 
changes in real time.) See an example in Figure 13-17 — the preset is 
High Contrast Red Filter, and I adjusted the Yellows slider.
 
4. (Optional) You may also click in the image (see Figure 13-18) and then 
drag left or right to decrease or increase the color percentage based 
on the source color of the area you clicked.
 
 This is a fast and effective way to modify the black-and-white image’s tones.
 
 You’re not colorizing the image when you make changes to the color slid-
ers. Rather, you’re adjusting the gray tone of the specific color you choose. 
This lets you make blues dark gray and reds light gray, for example.

Alternatively, control the color by modifying the Hue. Control strength with 
Saturation. Then click OK.

Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
Quick and dirty edits
Photoshop Elements has three editing modes: 
Full (which I’m using in this chapter), Quick, and 
Guided:
 ✓ Quick: Includes a saturation control you 
can use to desaturate the image.
 ✓ Guided Edit: Has two options you might 
want to try: Enhance Colors (leads to desat-
uration) and Old Fashioned Photo (guides 
you through converting a photo to black and 
white, and then colorizing it).
Colorizing Black-and-White Images
Colorizing (often called tinting or toning) black-and-white images overlays 
one, two, or more colors over the black-and-white image, resulting in an 
aged or other creative effect. For example, sepia-toned images that have the 
appearance of aging are created this way (well, aside from photos that aged 
naturally, of course).
There are several ways to approach colorizing images, depending on the 
application you use to edit your images. Although you can experiment and 
use these methods prior to creating the HDR image (much like converting 
brackets to black-and-white before generating the HDR image and tone map-
ping it), my examples here use a completed tone mapped image.
Using Elements to colorize
Photoshop Elements has a few interesting ways to colorize images. They 
are easy to use although limited. For example, you can’t colorize while 
you convert the image to black and white or use the Duotone mode like in 
Photoshop. Most of the time, you convert color images to black and white 
by choosing Enhance➪Convert to Black and White. You can’t colorize while 
doing that. However, if you convert to black and white by desaturating the 
image by choosing Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation (that 
there’s a mouth full), you can colorize. This disclaimer has been brought to 
you by Photoshop Elements 8.
Colorizing using the Hue/Saturation dialog box
The easiest solution is to first convert the image to black and white, as 
described in the earlier section, “Using Convert to Black and White.” Then 
choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Adjust Hue/Saturation.

287
 Chapter 13: Going Old School with Black-and-White HDR
Select the Colorize check box and then adjust the Hue and Saturation sliders 
accordingly. Hue controls the color, and Saturation controls intensity. You 
can also modify the overall brightness of the image with the Lightness slider. 
When finished, click OK. See the effects on a tone mapped photo in Figure 
13-19 where I’m creating an old, blown-out look.
Figure 13-19: Colorize applies a single hue to the image.
Applying color layers
An alternate approach is to use color layers, which allows you to blend more 
than one color, and even erase and blend the colors in creative ways. You 
could have blue-tinted shadows and gold-tinted highlights, for example. To 
use color layers, follow these steps on an image already converted to black 
and white:
 
1. Create a color fill layer by 
choosing Layer➪New Fill 
Layer➪Solid Color.
 
2. In the New Layer dialog box 
that appears (see Figure 13-20), 
click OK.
Figure 13-20: Creating a new fill layer.

288
Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
 
3. Choose a color from the Color 
Picker (as shown in Figure 
13-21), and then click OK.
 
 You can choose a basic color 
from the vertical rainbow and 
then select a specific hue (light 
or dark, intense or muted) from 
the large color box in the 
middle. Or, you can enter color 
values in the HSB, RGB, or Web 
color boxes. I opt for a gold 
color in Figure 13-21.
 
4. From the Layers palette, open 
the drop-down list to change 
the blending mode from Normal to Color; 
see Figure 13-22.
 
 Blending modes affect whether and how 
layers on top allow other layers to show 
through. Normally, they don’t allow other 
layers to show through because they’re 
opaque. You can change this behavior, 
which is what you’re counting on to colorize 
the image.
 
5. Lower the color layer opacity to blend 
by using the Opacity slider on the Layers 
palette.
 
 The Opacity slider controls the color inten-
sity, as shown in Figure 13-23. The black-and-
white image should show through even at 
100% because you changed the blend mode 
to color.
 
 If you have more than one color layer, all 
except the very bottom one must have an 
opacity less than 100% to allow the bottom 
ones to show through.
 
6. Add more color layers if desired.
 
7. Blend by erasing areas you don’t want colorized.
 
 This allows you to isolate colors from different layers and have them 
apply to specific areas of the image. For more about blending, see 
Chapter 10.

to color.

Using the Color Variations dialog box
Elements offers another colorizing tool — Color Variations. Several controls 
are available here with which you can increase or decrease colors in specific 
tonal regions. In other words, if you want to increase green in the shadows, 
you can. The downside is that you have only three color options: Red, Green, 
and Blue.
 
All is not lost, however, because a side effect of decreasing any of the three 
primary colors is increasing another color. Red and cyan are thus linked, as 
are green and magenta, and blue and yellow. Therefore, to increase cyan, 
decrease red. Although this is an easy method, it’s sometimes hard to exer-
cise fine control over the process, and the preview window is tiny.
Adjustment layers
Many layer adjustments can be applied directly 
to the layer you’re working on (the method I use 
in this chapter) or through adjustment layers, 
which are layers that make changes to the 
layers below them without altering the original 
layer’s content. For example, you can colorize a 
black-and-white layer by using the Adjust Hue/
Saturation dialog box and apply the changes to 
that layer, or create an hue/saturation adjust-
ment layer and achieve the same effect.
In general, adjustment layers take up more 
memory and make the application run slower. 
However, they have the benefit of preserving 
your original material. So, I encourage you to 
experiment with adjustment layers and see 
what you think. Many feel that the extra RAM 
usage is worth being able to save your origi-
nal image, open and re-edit the layer, or hide it 
and add a new one to take a different direction. 
Your call.

290
Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
To colorize a black-and-white image in Elements using the Color Variations 
dialog box, follow these steps:
 
1. Modify brightness and contrast as desired by selecting an option from 
either the Enhance➪Adjust Lighting menu or the Enhance➪Adjust 
Color➪Adjust Color Curves menu.
 
 Increase contrast for a nice, dramatic effect. You can also alter shadows, 
midtones, and highlight brightness as well as midtone contrast.
 
2. Choose Enhance➪Adjust Color➪Color Variations.
 
 The Color Variations dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 13-24.
 
3. Increase and decrease colors by selecting a radio button (Midtones, 
Shadows, Highlights, or Saturation), and then adjusting the Amount 
slider.
 
4. Choose a color to increase or decrease by clicking the appropriate 
button (Increase Red, Decrease Red, and so on). To lighten or darken 
the image as a whole, click the Lighten or Darken button.
 
5. (Optional) Click the Undo button if you don’t like a change; click the 
Reset Image button to revert to the original and start over.
 
6. When you’re satisfied with the results, click OK.

 Chapter 13: Going Old School with Black-and-White HDR
Using Photoshop to colorize
Photoshop has many of the same features as Elements (Colorizing, Color 
Variations, and Color Layers), so I won’t repeat them here. As you’d expect, 
Photoshop offers more power-user features that give you greater control 
over colorizing.
Duotoning
The Photoshop color mode Duotone automatically applies colored tints in 
various proportions. Duotone is easy and powerful, and has a lot of options. 
You can choose the number of colors, specific toning curves for each color, 
and the colors themselves. (CMYK is available as well.) However, your image 
must be converted to grayscale, which is 8 bits per channel.
 
Although the name of this tool is Duotone (two colors), you can have one 
color (Monotone) or more: three (Tritone) or four (Quadtone).
To apply a duotone, start with an image already converted to black and white 
using your favorite method. It can still be a 8 Bits/Channel or 16 Bits/Channel 
RGB image at this point (that is, a black-and-white image in a color space). 
The point is for you to have a chance to control the black and white tonality. 
If you want to quickly colorize an image and not spend a whole lot of time 
converting it to black and white first, jump right into the following steps.
Follow these steps to apply a duotone:
 
1. Convert your image to 8 bits per channel by choosing Image➪Mode➪
8 Bits/Channel.
 
2. Convert your image to grayscale by choosing Image➪Mode➪
Grayscale.
 
 You need to have an 8 bits/channel image converted to grayscale to use 
duotone — it won’t work with any other format.
 
3. Convert your image to Duotone by choosing Image➪Mode➪Duotone.
 
 The Duotone Options dialog box shows a monotone to begin with ini-
tially, or the settings from your last application.
Cross-processing in Elements
A good way to use the Color Variations dialog 
box in Elements is for cross-processing, which 
is a technique used to develop film in chemical 
solutions meant for another type of film. The 
result is an oddly colorized image, often heavy 
in greens and yellows.

292
Part IV: Having Fun with HDR Images 
 
4. In the Duotone Options dialog box, choose a preset from the Preset 
drop-down list.
 
 You might prefer to find some presets you like and possibly modify and 
save them as your own. (Configure the settings you like, and then select 
the small drop-down list tucked between the Preset menu and the OK 
button — within this list are the Save and Load Preset options.) Figure 
13-25 shows a preset loaded in the dialog box and the image visible 
onscreen. I selected the BMY Sepia 4 option in the Preset drop-down list, 
chose Tritone from the Type drop-down list, and tweaked other details.
Figure 13-25: Viewing the effects of a tritone preset.
 
 To create your own colorized image, use these options:
 
• Type: Select Monotone, Duotone, Tritone, or Quadtone.
 
• Duotone Curve: Click the little graph beside each color to control 
how the tones are applied. Make them darker, lighter, increase the 
contrast, and so on. The process is similar to adding points on a 
histogram to brighten or darken, but you are limited to specific ink 
percentages.
 
• Ink: Click the color swatch to open the Color Picker and choose a 
new color.

293
 Chapter 13: Going Old School with Black-and-White HDR
 
• Color name: If you’re using a preset, the preset color name 
appears. If you selected a color from the Color Picker, you can 
name the color whatever you want.
 
• Overprint Colors: Click the Overprint Colors button to open a dialog 
box where you can specify in what order the colors are printed. 
For example, the result of printing red over blue can look different 
than printing blue over red.
 
5. Click OK.
 
 That’s it. I recommend saving the colorized image as a separate file 
because it’s now an 8 bit-per-channel duotone image.
Cross-processing
There is no direct way to cross-process in Elements, but cross-processing 
in Photoshop is easy. Cross-processing is a technique used to develop film in 
chemical solutions meant for another type of film. The result is an oddly col-
orized image, often heavy in greens and yellows.
Because this is a chapter on black-and-white HDR, I tell you to start with 
a tone mapped image that you’ve already converted to black and white. 
However, you can cross-process color images as well — I encourage you to 
experiment and see if you like the results. To cross-process a black-and-white 
image in Photoshop, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Image➪Adjustments➪Curves.
 
 The Curves dialog box appears. Photoshop uses curves to alter the in-to-
out ratio of each color channel to create contrasted greens and yellows.
 
2. Select the Cross Process (RGB) preset from the Preset drop-down list.
 
 Figure 13-26 illustrates a tone mapped photo with the Curves dialog 
box open and the Cross Process (RGB) preset loaded. Notice the 
otherworldly green tones applied to the image. That’s the beauty of 
cross-processing.
 
3. Alter if desired by adjusting the RGB curve or selecting specific 
channels (R, G, or B) and adjusting those curves individually.
 
 You can completely customize the strength and balance of colors this way.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 You’re free to continue editing or publish your image.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
he Part of Tens concludes every For Dummies 
book — and for good reason: It’s a fun way to 
ﬁ nish. Despite being fun, I tried to make this as 
practical and helpful as possible.
Chapter 14 starts off with ten ways to shoot better 
photos for HDR, ranging from being patient while 
your family waits in the van to looking around for 
additional angles and shots at the same scene. 
Chapter 15 reverses this and shows you ten ways 
to ruin a good HDR image. These are things not to 
do. They range from overprocessing and over-
sharpening to overreacting.

(More Than) Ten Ways to Shoot 
Better Photos for HDR
T
aking better photos for HDR involves two things: taking better photos 
in general, and effectively using the particular techniques of HDR. If you 
aren’t taking good photos, whether you employ HDR techniques (like using 
a tripod or AEB) is irrelevant. Likewise, you diminish the effect of shooting 
wonderfully contrasted clouds at sunset in a five-shot bracketed set if you fail 
to understand how to set up and compose the shot.
This chapter, therefore, provides helpful hints, reminders, and showcase 
showdown images to help steer you in the right direction. There are certainly 
more than ten ways to shoot better photos for HDR, but here is a good cross-
section of HDR-specific information and general photography pointers.
Getting a Good Tripod
Get a good tripod. Cheap tripods are, well, cheap. 
They aren’t stable, don’t allow you to change heads, 
break easily, and mark you as an amateur. Good 
tripods are worth the investment. I have never 
regretted — not for a minute — spending extra for 
my Manfrotto tripod (the legs), heads (one ball and 
one pan-tilt), and a good bag. This was after going 
through several cheaper versions. You don’t have to 
run out and buy a Manfrotto (distributed by Bogen, 
by the way). Shop around and find something that 
suits you. Try Gitzo, Induro, Slik, or Calumet. A good 
tripod makes aligning HDR brackets easier in software. 
Your overall HDR image will be sharper as a result. And, a 
good tripod is especially a great investment if you have thousands 

298
Part V: The Part of Tens 
of dollars of camera and lenses to protect. These tripods have very strong 
mounting plates (the thing you attach your camera to that mounts it on the 
tripod) and don’t tip over or collapse easily.
Being Patient
Photo shoots are often exciting. The scenery is beautiful, and you’re pumped 
to get good shots. It’s easy to be swept up by the fun and start rushing your-
self, but don’t. Be patient and enjoy yourself.
Going fast often results in errors. You may forget to change a camera setting 
(I have), leave the camera in the wrong shooting mode (I have), forget where 
you are in your shoot — “How many brackets are left?” — (I have), and end 
up ruining the shoot (I have). Patience is also a strong factor in how you com-
pose a scene. If you take your time, you can analyze scenes and purposefully 
compose better shots. It isn’t a race.
Becoming a Cloud Watcher
HDR photography happens outside a good portion of the time, which is (con-
veniently) where clouds tend to congregate. Go figure. So pay attention to the 
clouds: how they move and in what direction. And also pay attention to their 
position in the sky in relation to the sun and what time it is. Early evening 
(the “golden hour”), the sky can look completely boring one minute and light 
up in a fantastic display the next. The sun strikes them from the side, and 
then underneath as it sets.
 
In the morning, play this scene in reverse — the horizon will glow, then 
the sun will peek up and light the bottoms of clouds, then the sides, then 
the tops.
Figure 14-1 illustrates several cloud formations at different times during 
the day and in different conditions. You can see there is a lot of variety. 
When you start paying attention to clouds you will start seeing more and 
more detail. When you start seeing this, you will start shooting better 
clouds (and skies, and scenes) more on purpose. Then your HDR photos 
will get better.

299
 Chapter 14: (More Than) Ten Ways to Shoot Better Photos for HDR
Figure 14-1: Clouds come in many sizes and shapes, and are lit with different colors.
Taking Your Camera with You
It really helps to have your camera with you almost everywhere you go 
because, you know, you can’t take a photograph without your camera. So 
toss your camera bag in the back seat or the trunk. That way, if you spot 
something on the way or the light 
that evening looks marvelous, you 
can stop and take a picture.
Figure 14-2 is a shot taken in the 
restroom at a local fast food estab-
lishment. The tiles fascinate me. I 
love the way they look like pools of 
blue liquid. After a while, I woke me 
up to the fact that I never had my 
camera with me to take a picture of 
them. The next time I was there, I 
took several bracketed sets and later 
processed them into HDR.
Loving HDR Photography
As odd as it sounds, you will take better HDR photos if you love doing it. If it’s 
a chore, a hassle, a distraction, or an otherwise dreary means to an end, you 
will end up holding back and mechanically executing your craft without much 
of a personal stake in it.
Figure 14-2: You can be spontaneous if you 
have your camera (and tripod) with you.

300
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Loving what I do helps me keep trying, even when it’s hard. It fuels my persis-
tence and motivates me to learn and practice. It also makes it easier to digest 
the (sometimes dry) aspects of exposure, cameras, gear, specifications, soft-
ware, and so forth.
Paying Attention to Light and Time
As you traipse around looking for good HDR shots, you will undoubtedly run 
into the same phenomena I have regarding light and time:
 
✓ Not all light is good. I used to love to go out at noon and take photo-
graphs because I thought the light was better. It certainly was stronger, 
but better?
 
 In general, no. Midday light causes lots of problems, actually — more 
than it solves. The first and greatest problem is the sun is so intense, 
shadows are very harsh. It’s like holding a flashlight directly over some-
one’s head as you take a photograph, only a thousand times worse.
 
✓ Not every time is good. This is intimately related to the first point 
because when shooting outdoors, time and light are closely related.
 
 As I mention earlier, the best time to shoot outdoors is during the 
golden hour — the hour or so before sunset and after sunrise. Dusk (a 
short period after sunset and before sunrise) can also be magical.
 
 When you start to think of light in terms of time, and vice versa, you are 
on your way to taking better photographs.
When you realize how important light and time are to the photograph, you’ll 
start taking better pictures. This is true even for HDR. Just because you can 
capture a broader range of light doesn’t mean every situation will produce an 
award-winning photo.
 
Pay attention to how your scenes (landscapes, buildings, and so on) are ori-
ented toward the setting or rising sun. Decide where you want the light to be 
for the best photograph; then see whether you can take that photo without 
obstructions or distractions.
Knowing Your Camera
Today’s brands of cameras rely extensively on auto this and auto that. One 
of the consequences of this is that many amateur photographers don’t learn 
how to use their cameras like they should.

301
 Chapter 14: (More Than) Ten Ways to Shoot Better Photos for HDR
Don’t be one of them. You’ll enjoy yourself more and take better pictures if 
you learn how to use your camera. Think of yourself as an engineer operating 
a complex piece of equipment — because you are. Take any dSLR camera and 
look at all the buttons, displays, knobs, and ports. More likely than not, that 
camera has a plethora of handy controls that are totally useless to you as a 
photographer if you don’t know how to use them.
The best way to learn what all the buttons and controls are and what 
they do is to read the manual. (Wiley Publishing offers a number of well-
illustrated books on a variety of dSLR models as well.) Learn every mode, 
switch, menu option, knob, and button. Learn how to use everything, and 
make sure to practice.
 
Read the manual in chunks. Don’t try to go from front to back in one sitting 
and expect to remember everything. Get the basics down and start adding bit 
by bit. Before you know it, you’ll have it!
Looking for Contrast
Although HDR specializes in capturing scenes with a high dynamic range 
of light, you can use other sources of contrast besides light. As you look at 
several examples of contrast here, keep these thoughts in mind:
 
✓ Light and dark: This is HDR’s specialty. 
Photograph scenes with a wide range of 
light and dark for best results.
 
✓ Colors: Colors can contrast as well. Blue-
gray clouds floating in a blue sky across a 
fiery red sunset. Green trees sit along a gray 
road with white clouds in a blue sky. Red 
rust on a blue truck with chrome details.
 
 Interior spaces look much better if they are 
filled with contrasting colors. Monotone 
rooms and spaces are relatively boooorrrring.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Textures and materials: Textures often contain details that can be 
accentuated in HDR. Brick, wood, stone, grass, rocks, and other rough 
surfaces are especially pleasing in HDR.
Returning to the Scene
Returning to a particular scene is a great way to learn and grow. You become 
familiar with the scene and see new things you missed during previous 
shoots. All the shots in Figure 14-3 are of the same walkway under construc-
tion at a local university. They were shot with different cameras, at different 
times, in different weather, and with different results. All are of the same sub-
ject, and all are in HDR.
Figure 14-3: Compelling scenes provide many great opportunities for HDR.

 Chapter 14: (More Than) Ten Ways to Shoot Better Photos for HDR
 
Scout out locations ahead of time — take some practice shots and evaluate 
them with the expectation of going back. You might end up using some of 
these shots.
 
Experiment with different times, angles, and bracketing solutions. Process 
the photos in your computer and 
study them to see how you can 
improve your photography. You will 
get better at it.
Looking Around
If you go to shoot a scene, look up, 
down, and sideways at other pos-
sible shots at that location. Turn 
around and see what’s behind you.
Figure 14-14 illustrates the point 
of shooting from different angles 
of the same location, in contrast 
to the previous section, where the 
same subject was photographed 
throughout. Notice that from one 
vantage point on a bridge, the sun 
set in a beautiful glow of color to 
the west, the city was bathed in 
golden hour light to the south, and 
the east had a magical presence to 
it as well. All the photos capture 
the amazing clouds that were pres-
ent that evening.
 
Always be on the lookout for oppor-
tunities to make your current trip 
pay off more than expected. If you 
go looking for one scene, come 
back with three. If you go to shoot 
a sunset, shoot what’s behind and 
beside you, too.
Figure 14-4: There’s always something behind 
and beside you.

304
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Using AEB
Although you can shoot HDR photography with many types of cameras of 
varying abilities, using auto exposure bracketing (AEB) really rocks. It takes 
away much of your workload, which allows you to concentrate on setup and 
composition.
If you have a fast camera, you can 
use AEB to shoot scenes that are 
impossible otherwise. The result in 
Figure 14-5 comprises five bracketed 
photos shot without a tripod. The 
only thing that makes this possible 
(I was just standing there — you 
could lean against a car or a pole, or 
brace the camera against your body 
for additional support) is using AEB, 
having enough ambient light, and a 
camera with a fast shutter speed. It’s 
HDR on the go, so to speak.
 
Moving clouds are particularly hard 
to shoot manually. Even those that 
don’t appear to be moving fast can 
look horrible once you process them 
in software.
Shuttering with a Purpose
Try this simple rule when composing a scene. It will have a profound impact 
on how you compose it. Take a picture of something. Not anything. Not 
nothing. Take it of a thing you can point to and say, “This is why I took the 
picture.” It could be a person, a tree, the sunset, a shadow, a horse, or a 
building. Landscape shots of “nothing” will challenge you on this.
For example, the HDR image of a soybean field in Figure 14-6 isn’t terribly 
bad, but it lacks purpose. Anyone could have walked out into this field and 
taken this shot. That’s part of the problem. There is nothing to set it apart. 
Here’s my point: HDR can’t make a bad photo good all the time. Don’t think 
that all you need to do is fire up the HDR application and turn anything into 
an amazing photo. Doesn’t work that way, and this shows it.
Figure 14-5: HDR from five hand-held exposures 
taken with AEB.

305
 Chapter 14: (More Than) Ten Ways to Shoot Better Photos for HDR
Figure 14-6: This shot lacks a strong purpose.
There are many ways to make these 
types of shots better. Figure 14-7 
shows a better composition, this 
time of a corn field. The tripod is 
lower, resulting in the corn plant in 
the foreground becoming the true 
subject of the scene. The rest of the 
field recedes into the background, 
and the field takes up more space in 
the shot than the sky, which itself is 
more attractive. The clouds are puffy 
and interesting. Even though they’re 
nice, they’re not the main element 
of the shot: It’s about that one corn 
plant. This photo has purpose and 
interest, which is then accentuated 
by HDR.

with a purpose.

Ten Ways to Ruin 
a Good HDR Image
You know, there are a lot of ways to ruin a harmless HDR image. I’ve done 
it myself more than I would like to admit. (Thankfully, you can pick up 
the original images any time and start over.) You might ruin images from a 
little over-eager-beaverness (closely related to overkillitis) to make it look 
HDR, or by being too timid.
This chapter, then, is a study in contradictions. For example, I tell you to 
crank up the contrast but then not to overdo the drama. And I warn you 
about losing your imagination but then say you’re going too far with HDR.
This chapter focuses on software ruination — not bracketing or other 
photography mistakes. Most people are likely to get into trouble 
while they tone map and edit HDR images — proactively ruin-
ing an image — rather than failing to capture it properly. 
With that encouraging thought in mind, after seeing and 
learning about these pitfalls, you’ll be armed to the 
teeth to prevent them.
Halos, Halos, Everywhere!
The number one way to ruin a good HDR image is 
the dreaded halo. Your photos might be perfect, 
but they don’t need halos to prove it. Figure 15-1 
illustrates a nice view off an old walking bridge on the 
river below with a nice sky and clouds above. What do 
you see in the ruined image (left)? Halos. Halos around the 
structure of the bridge and the tree line.

308
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
What typically happens is that you’re focused on achieving a certain look in 
other areas of the photo that you either miss or ignore the fact that you’re 
ruining the entire thing by leaving in halos.
The image on the right side of Figure 15-1 shows an alternative — tone 
mapped and processed to create a similar look without the halos. Much 
better! There are certain compromises, of course. The sky is brighter and 
the structure darker. It looks closer to a realistic scene, but still not without 
drama. If you wanted to bump that up a notch, you could further increase 
contrast and do some dodging and burning in post-HDR editing.
Figure 15-1: You don’t have to ruin an image with halos.
Wimping Out on Contrast
HDR images thrive in contrast: That’s the point. You’re capturing loads of 
contrast when you go to the trouble of shooting brackets. Don’t settle for 
images, then, that are too mushy in the contrast department. Live it. Love it.
The top image in Figure 15-2 shows a potentially gorgeous sunset with power-
ful colors and interesting details. The problem is that there is no contrast. 
The colors look muted, and details are not accentuated. Sometimes we get 

309
 Chapter 15: Ten Ways to Ruin a Good HDR Image
scared of blowing out highlights or making something look too bold. It might 
not be possible to achieve the level of contrast you want as you tone map. 
In this case (see the bottom image in Figure 15-2), additional contrast was 
added after the tone mapped image was saved. Additional burning made the 
clouds and shadows on the water darker.
Figure 15-2: Contrast is Cing.
 
Believe it or not, that is why the colors look so much better: contrast. 
Contrast sharpens the details of the clouds and sky, creates bold colors, and 
makes for a much more interesting photo.

310
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Imagination Smackdown
Imagination is a powerful thing, a fact that is made more obvious when you see 
the result of not using it versus using it. It’s an Imagination Smackdown. The 
top image in Figure 15-3 is an HDR image of a local diner during the “golden 
hour” — that late time of day when the sun is low, and objects are more sun-lit 
from the side and bottom (there’s one in the morning too). The problem is that 
the lens I was using (and have since returned) had horrific distortion charac-
teristics. Nothing looks right in this image. I tried and tried to do something 
that I like with this photo, and have come up short each time. The windows, 
though, have always caught my attention. So, I decided to focus on them.
Rather than leave anything else in the image, I cropped and transformed so 
that the windows took center stage. I moved the right window to the left a bit 
to cover the sign and cloned to blend it in. The end result (see the bottom of 
Figure 15-3) is something really powerful. It’s colorful, interesting, completely 
unexpected — it’s imagination.
 
When your images show imagination, people will be far more interested in 
looking at your work — it will be worth their time and effort to seek you out.
Figure 15-3: Imagination wins every time.

 Chapter 15: Ten Ways to Ruin a Good HDR Image
This Isn’t Casper, The Friendly Ghost
If something is moving in your image and creates ghosting artifacts to the 
point of becoming a distraction, take it out or mask it. Don’t let it dominate 
the final image.
The top image in Figure 15-4 was 
cropped from a scene with traffic 
moving up the road. It’s an interest-
ing scene, but it has ghosts galore. 
(If you’re into math and physics, it 
is a good illustration of speed, time, 
shutter speed, and frame rate.)
 
Had this been at night or had the 
ghosting been more “river like” 
(with a constant stream of cars 
instead of a stop-start-stop appear-
ance) it would probably be worth 
leaving the ghosting in.
The version without ghosting is also 
shown on the bottom of Figure 15-4. 
The truck is solid and contributes to 
the image. This was achieved when creating the HDR (ghosting options) and 
also by overlaying solid traffic over the ghosts (masking and blending).
Sharpening From Dusk ’Til Dawn
Much like the mania with noise reduction, photographers are sometimes 
obsessed with sharpness. They want everything to be pixelly perfectly 
sharp from the nose of the camera to infinity, no matter what lens, aper-
ture, ISO, or shutter speed they use. If you get caught up in that, you’re 
primed to over-sharpen your HDR images.
Figure 15-5 shows the results of over-sharpening (and then a proper 
amount) on a close-up of Dale Earnhardt’s #3 car at the Kruse Automotive 
and Carriage Museum. Over-sharpening introduced artifacts, noise, and 
imperfections in the top image (which is a bit overdone, to try to show you 
the result in this book). Alternatively, when you go easy, as in the bottom 
image, you’re left with a much clearer image with less noise and no edge 
artifacts.
Figure 15-4: B’bye, ghosts.

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
Here’s a trick. Don’t over-magnify 
when you’re editing images. They’ll 
always look bad at 1600% — much 
like you would look like under a 
microscope. Back away from the 
magnifying glass. In fact, get into the 
habit of zooming out and looking at 
the image as if it were printed nor-
mally to gauge what is discernible for 
the average print or not. If the image 
is 300 dots per inch (dpi), 25% magni-
fication is a good representation; if at 
72 dpi, then 100%.
Too Much Noise Reduction 
Going On
It’s tempting to try and squash every 
little bit of noise from a tone mapped 
HDR image the moment you see 
it. I think everyone is slowly being 
programmed to expect perfection 
because of computers and digital 
logic. No work of art, photograph, or 
man-made anything has reached the 
lofty goal of perfection.
 
So, get used to noise. Don’t overdo 
the noise reduction. You’ll end up 
with a featureless blob with no 
sharpness and soft details. It’s okay. 
You can even embrace noise at times 
and use it to good effect.
Figure 15-6 shows part of a tall building with too much noise reduction 
(left) and just the right amount (right).The window looks soft and fuzzy, the 
reflections of the trees turn into a green blob, and the concrete looks too 
smooth.
Figure 15-5: Over-sharpening adds noise and 
crud to your images.

 Chapter 15: Ten Ways to Ruin a Good HDR Image

Putting a Square Peg into a Round Hole
When you run into a situation and it 
seems like nothing is working — 
the settings don’t look good, the 
image feels wrong, the effects are all 
bad — relax and take a break. The 
image is telling you something. 
That something is sometimes 
related to forcing a solution to an 
image. These are the times it pays to 
realize you’re trying to put a square 
peg in a round hole.
I have bracketed sets that I took a 
year ago, and after an initial round 
of processing and tone mapping, I 
concluded that there wasn’t much 
I could do with them. Instead of 
trying to force it to happen, I left 
them alone and kept shooting new 
sets. In the process, I learned a lot.
Figure 15-7 shows a ruined photo of 
a tulip (top) compared with some-
thing more reasonable (bottom). 
Figure 15-7: Letting go of preconceived notions 
of HDR.

314
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The top image is the result of my impatience and stubbornness. I was 
shooting bracketed HDR and wanted this flower to look dramatic. I wanted 
to use the same settings on this image that I have been using on others. The 
problem was that the flower wasn’t cooperating. When this happens, pay 
attention. Tell yourself, “Self, I may be trying to put a square peg in a round 
hole.” Stop. Relax. Come back later with a different mindset. The results can 
be very good if you do!
Timidity on the Coloroidity
In general, bold, contrasting color is interesting to look at. It’s powerful 
and striking. It reaches out, grabs you, and pulls you toward it. It gets your 
attention.
 
The problem is that color is a fickle beast. Sometimes it rewards you. 
Sometimes it punishes you. I think this (with perhaps some peer pressure of 
some photographers who insist on mildness) results in many photographers 
being too timid when editing images.
Figure 15-8 is a comparison of being a little too timid (top) versus being bold 
with color (bottom). The timid version doesn’t look bad, mind you. I did not 
desaturate or damage it so you would look at it and say, “Oh, that’s the bad 
one!” However, compare it with the bottom image. It’s striking. The bolder 
version really works. It makes a statement. Go back and look at some of your 
images in your editor and see if you tend to be timid or not. Increase the satu-
ration by 10% to 30% and see how it looks.
Too Much HDR
Sometimes too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. I remember when 
I first started working with HDR. I would generate an HDR image and then 
tone map it with the most absurdly unrealistic and impractical settings pos-
sible. I loved the otherworldliness of it. It was HDR. Well, it wasn’t too long 
until I realized that maybe I was overdoing it a bit. I started pulling back 
on some settings and allowing myself to increase the Light Smoothing in 
Photomatix Pro. The result was a bit more realism and a lot more satisfac-
tion in the long run.

315
 Chapter 15: Ten Ways to Ruin a Good HDR Image
Figure 15-8: Bold color gets attention.
Figure 15-9 shows a comparison of how this looks in practice. The scene is the 
New Castle (Indiana) Chrysler High School Fieldhouse (“The Largest and Finest 
High School Fieldhouse in the World”). The top version shows too much HDR. 
I have to admit — it calls to me. It really does. However, in most cases (see, I 
can barely bring myself to say it), it’s just too much HDR. The light balance is 
funky, and there are too many details. Compare it with the more realistic ver-
sion (bottom). This is a great picture. This is what it looks like in person, and 
the version that uses HDR to achieve a good balance of drama versus realism.

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Figure 15-9: You can have too much HDR sometimes.
Overreacting to Criticism
The bottom line is this: Your HDR images are yours. Ultimately, what you 
create should appeal to you on some level. Start there. Be comfortable with 
that (but don’t let it go to your head).
Figure 15-10 illustrates two different interpretations of the same scene. I love 
this scene. A guy (out of the frame) and his dad were eating in this pavilion 
at the park when I brought my family over for some photography and fun. 
The kids played in the playground (you can see it in the background), while I 
walked around with my gear and shot brackets. I timed the shots so the older 
gentleman wasn’t moving.

317
 Chapter 15: Ten Ways to Ruin a Good HDR Image
Figure 15-10: One scene — two different interpretations.
So, which version works? Which one doesn’t? Both. Neither. It depends on 
who you’re asking. If that person hates overdramatized HDR, he will vote for 
the realistic version. If that person loves the way HDR makes a photo look 
like art, then she will shun the realistic version and say if you want that, just 
go take a single picture.
 
Always recognize who your audience is and who is giving you feedback. They 
are not always the same group. Make sure you’re responding to criticism for 
the right reasons. Is it to improve your work? Is it to reach your audience 
better? Is it to make people like you?
