Preface
When people talk about project management, a discussion of ethics is 
rarely at the top of anyone’s list. Procurement management, risk manage-
ment, scheduling, and communications management, to name just a few, 
are all considered before there is any mention of ethics. Even on some cer-
tification exams it is treated as an ancillary topic. Yet ironically, an ethical 
violation is one of the quickest ways to destroy a project in general and a 
project manager in particular. Then, interestingly, topics like procurement 
management, risk management, and time management are somehow no 
longer important, and ethics becomes the center of discussion.
Ethics, therefore, is about choice—about becoming a topic worthy of 
attention and about making judgments and taking action to do what is 
ethical. You or your team members make a choice between what is and 
is not correct. Yet, while the choice is between right and wrong, the deci-
sions and actions taken involve a considerable amount of gray. There is no 
algorithm to help you or any other project manager deal with issues about 
ethics with absolute assurance of effectiveness. About the most you can 
hope for is to make a judgment and act in a manner that resolves an issue 
equitably and honestly.
Ethics is not just for the big boys, either. Enron and other companies that 
joined its ranks may be titular examples of how poor ethical decisions and 
actions bring havoc on a wide range of stakeholders, from stockholders 
to employees. Ethics is also a concern for the people in the trenches who 
execute the strategies to produce a product or deliver a service. An ethical 
lapse can cost a corporation millions and frequently billions—all because 
a rank-and-file employee made or executed an unethical decision.
Many organizations may go through the motions of compliance train-
ing, but that is only one part of ethics and often gives people the illusion 
that they are ethical merely because they have been trained. Nothing is 
further from the truth. Just like taking a course on religion does not make 
you religious or completing a class on accounting does not make you a 
great accountant, ethics compliance, albeit necessary, is just one aspect. 

xvi  •  Preface
Ethics must be total in thought and application if it is to be effective; any-
thing less is compromise.
Let’s say you are a project manager on a multimillion dollar project. For 
some companies that is a big project; for others it is small. Regardless, you 
have an ethical responsibility to your organization, to your project, and to 
yourself to take the high road, meaning that you have to do what’s right. 
You will have to make judgments and take actions that will have ethical 
consequences on a constant basis. Straying from that road can negatively 
impact many areas—for example, people, performance, processes, per-
ception, and profits (what I call the five Ps). Any ethical lapse will likely 
impact one, some, or all of these areas.
The pressures today are really no less than those in the past; however, 
they have taken a different form and provide opportunities for severe 
lapses in ethical judgment and actions in some very open and subtle ways. 
Some of those pressures include an unrelenting pressure to produce faster, 
better, cheaper; to manage projects and programs spread across the globe 
involving different cultures with varying perceptions about what is ethi-
cal; to lead projects in an environment where people can do great work 
and still find themselves without a job due to outsourcing; and experience 
an augmented regulatory oversight environment that may reveal events 
and activities which, up to this point in time, went undetected.
Ethics is what I call a positive negative: Good ethical behavior has posi-
tive consequences and is never appreciated and, therefore, gets no atten-
tion; lack of ethical behavior occurs and only then is appreciated because 
of the negative consequences that arise. It is like education; if you think 
it is expensive, then try ignorance and you’ll see the costs. People have a 
tendency to view ethics as fluff and something that adds no value and, 
consequently, pay no attention to ethical judgments and behavior until 
something goes ethically awry and costs an organization, a project, and a 
person’s career. Once the consequences become real, then suddenly ethics 
has value and then, sadly, it is often too late.
As a project manager and corporate auditor with a Fortune 500 firm 
spanning 25 years, I have reviewed and managed several ethics-related 
projects and programs at the strategic and operational levels. A strong 
argument can be made that ethics is equally important at both levels 
because an ethical lapse—either in judgment or action—occurs where the 
real work is done, where strategic dreams, so to speak, become operational

realities. A poor decision on an ethical dilemma can wreck the best of 
intentions when tainted with poor judgment and behavior.
I also want to thank Ameeta Chianani for taking the time to review the 
manuscript and to provide insights on improving it.

Ethics and Project Management
The subject of ethics, of course, is not a new one. It has been around for 
many centuries. Like the topic itself, circumstances dealing with ethics 
continue to resurface everywhere, often with disturbing repetitiveness. 
That goes for the project environment, too. Whether managing a large, 
medium, or small project, project managers will have to confront ethics 
on an ongoing basis.
1.1  WHAT IS ETHICS?
There are many different definitions of ethics:
•	 “Ethics refers to a systematic study of the norms and values that 
guide how humans should live their lives.”*
•	 “[Ethics] is the activity of understanding moral values, resolving 
moral issues, and justifying moral judgments. It is also the discipline 
or area of study resulting from that activity.”†
•	 “[Ethics is] a branch of philosophy dealing with values that relate 
to the nature of human conduct and values associated with that 
conduct.”‡
*	 Joseph Desjardins, An Introduction to Business Ethics, 2nd ed. (Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2006), 
p. G3.
†	 Roland Schinzinger and Mike W. Martin, Introduction to Engineering Ethics (Boston: McGraw-
Hill, 2000), p. 8.
‡	 David P. Twoney and Marianne M. Jennings, Law and Business (Australia: Cengage Publishing, 
2008), p. G9.

2  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
•	 “The study of ethics generally consists of examination of right, wrong, 
good, evil, virtue, duty, obligation, rights, justice, fairness, and so on, 
in human relationships with each other and other living things.”*
•	 “Ethics involves judgments about the rightness or wrongness of 
human behavior.”†
These definitions seem to center around certain characteristics that are 
addressed by the topic of ethics in general:
•	 Determining good from bad. Frequently, that means choosing right 
from wrong. An example is determining when a particular action on 
your part or that of a team member needs to be addressed.
•	 Judgment. As a project manager, you often have to decide whether to 
make a decision about an ethical situation or whether to take action 
and to what degree. An example would be determining whether to 
elevate an ethical situation to higher management for resolution.
•	 Behavior. Ethical beliefs are exhibited values that are reflected 
through action. In other words, beliefs and values influence behavior. 
You and your team members reflect ethics through the ways you and 
the others make decisions and how you go about executing them. An 
example would be whether an ethical decision is made unilaterally 
or through the consultation of other team members.
•	 Ethical situations. Some of these situations involve dealing with 
adverse topics, adding a level of complexity that other project man-
agement topics address. For example, calculating earned value is 
straightforward; addressing a situation that injures a person’s repu-
tation is not that black and white.
•	 Determining the appropriate response to a given situation. This 
requires looking at a number of options and choosing the right 
one that effectively resolves an issue. Determining an appropriate 
response requires wrestling with issues like fairness, integrity, objec-
tivity, honesty, and appropriateness. Tied closely to judgment, proj-
ect managers must respond in such a manner that requires taking 
the high road, which in this case is choosing a response commensu-
rate with the circumstances. An example is bringing attention to an

(Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2007), p. xxii.

ethical issue that could result in angering certain key stakeholders 
even though you know you are right in doing so.
From the perspective of a project manager, ethics can therefore be defined 
as exercising objective judgment, after considering all options, on what is 
the right decision and response when dealing with ethical situations.
1.2  MISPERCEPTIONS ABOUT ETHICS
Applying such a definition in the real world of project management is not 
easy. In the contemporary environment, projects and team members find 
themselves in a fluid, dynamic realm that makes ethics a difficult topic to 
address. The pressure is immense to reduce costs and to meet an aggres-
sive schedule and rigorous quality standards. This leads to opportunities 
to put ethics aside as a topic of serious consideration; it remains the case 
in many organizations, unfortunately. This happens for many reasons 
because there are some misperceptions surrounding ethics, some of which 
are described below.
1.2.1  Ethics Has No Bottom-Line Value
It is hard to fathom, but some people argue that the topic of ethics offers 
no value because it offers nothing tangible. Nothing could be further 
from the truth. Ethics offers nontangible and tangible value. From a non-
tangible value perspective, perhaps the most important benefit is that it 
provides a framework for making decisions and taking actions—not so 
much when the issues are easy to discern but when a confusing level of 
complexity exists. A strong sense of ethics enables project managers to 
make decisions and to take action to deal with the gray areas of ethical 
situations. These areas exist when right from wrong is unclear. From a tan-
gible value perspective, perhaps the most important benefit is when eth-
ics fails and the consequences become quite apparent. Disbarment from 
future contracts with the government and levy of civil and criminal fines 
on individuals and firms are tangible results. However, some findings sug-
gest that ethics also leads to something else that is tangible: greater profits. 
From a project perspective, the tangible value is apparent through greater

information sharing and collaboration among team members. When that 
fails to occur, especially when ethical circumstances deteriorate, project 
managers can see the result: slipped schedules, poor quality of output, and 
exceeding the budget.
1.2.2  Ethics Is an Abstract, Not a Real, Concept
This misperception is closely related to the previous point. The difference 
here is that people often construe ethics as important in a college course 
on philosophy but not in the real world when products are being produced 
and services are being delivered. According to some people, discussions of 
Socrates, Plato, and Joseph Campbell belong at the university and not in 
the work environment. Unfortunately, this misperception is shortsighted, 
leading to decisions and actions that can cause considerable real damage 
to a project and the company at large. For example, project managers who 
do not appreciate or understand the conceptual underpinnings of ethical 
theory will find themselves facing legal or even extralegal problems.
1.2.3  Ethics Is a Stand-Alone Topic
This means, of course, that it is a topic that has no relevance with oth-
ers topics. Ethics permeates other topics and needs to be integrated with 
them. You cannot divorce ethics from risk management, time manage-
ment, cost management, or any other topic related to project management. 
Project managers must, and often do without realizing it, incorporate 
ethics in their decisions and actions when managing and leading their 
projects. Project managers who do not consider ethics now will find them-
selves doing so later on, if and when ethical violations occur, for example, 
when executing a schedule and reporting on it.
1.2.4  Ethics Is Applicable to People Only 
at the Top of an Organization
It is convenient to come to this conclusion because often the news of an 
ethical transgression makes it to the headlines when it involves a chief 
executive officer (CEO) of a major corporation. Once again, nothing can 
be further from the truth. Ethics applies up and down the hierarchy,

whether for projects at the executive or operational levels. Without one 
realizing it, the failure of ethics can have tremendous effects on a project 
or program without having to be immediate. For example, gratuities from 
a customer that exceed a certain value can affect objective decision mak-
ing about the quality of output. This would result in long-term warranty 
costs and litigation from the public but would never make the headlines. 
Ethics applies not just to project managers but also to their team mem-
bers. According to an allPM.com survey, project team members are “most 
likely” to recognize potential problems on a project. Those who fall within 
“least likelihood” are project managers, users, and senior managers.*
1.2.5  Ethics Applies to the Other Person
The same mind-set works here. Ethics involves someone else because my 
job is not as important or because there is less visibility in what I do. This 
misperception can lead to gross oversights in ethical behavior because it is 
perceived that everything about a project occurs under the radar. In real-
ity, a lapse in ethics under these circumstances can result in ethical trans-
gressions that can have negative impacts once discovered. What the public 
does not know won’t hurt it, goes an old saying. But if the public does find 
out, all sorts of financial and legal problems could arise. Ethics applies to 
everyone, under all circumstances, regardless of scale and visibility.
1.2.6  Ethics Involves Only Compliance
If that were the case, ethics would be simply a matter of obeying laws and 
regulations. To a large extent, this view of ethics seems to prevail today. 
Unfortunately, it is a shortsighted one. True, fines and penalties can be 
severe, and public relations can become a disaster for a firm when an ethi-
cal transgression occurs. Compliance, however, is one sliver of the complex 
topic of ethics, especially on projects. Ethics covers character, integrity, 
honesty, fairness, and trust, to name just a few topics manifested through 
the decisions and actions involved in a given project. An unethical deci-
sion or action can affect how the team works together, its quality of output, 
and its treatment of the customer. Compliance is just one variable of the 
equation of ethics.

1.2.7  Ethics Deals Only with Matters That Are 
“Black and White” in Nature
Wrong. In fact, the argument can be made that if answers are as simple as 
being black and white (e.g., do this and don’t do that), then ethics would be 
a no-brainer. But quite often, ethics deal with gray issues, ones where the 
decision or actions taken are not black and white and the consequences 
are unknown. Project managers, more often than not, deal with gray 
issues. For example, they have to make decisions and take actions related 
to negotiations with vendors. These decisions and actions could impair 
relationships or determine which data and information to share with part-
ners, while simultaneously comply with intellectual capital requirements. 
Project managers frequently have to balance such decisions and actions 
while at the same time ensuring compliance with organizational policies 
and procedures.
1.3  KEY FACTORS
Project managers and their team members are influenced by many factors, 
spanning across the work and nonwork environment, in their definition 
and perception of ethics.
1.3.1  Peers
Whether in the work or nonwork environment, one of the strongest influ-
ences is peer relationships. In the nonwork environment, the peer influence 
can come from members of a professional society or a social networking 
group. It can even come from friends or acquaintances the project man-
agers or their team members may have known over a period of time. In a 
work environment, it can come from fellow team members or other key 
stakeholders, such as a functional manager to whom they report directly.
One of the major sources of peer pressure can be from groups, infor-
mal as well as formal, in the workplace. Formal groups are the established 
organizations within an organization. These are people, by virtue of their 
position (e.g., executives, senior management), who are shown in a typi-
cal organization chart. In contrast, informal groups are not reflected in 
an organizational chart but have a powerful influence, sometimes more 
so than formal groups. These may be people of the same age group, 

Ethics and Project Management  •  7
people with a common background or trade, who share common inter-
ests. Informal groups can arise inside and outside the organization.
A project team often is a formal grouping of people to accomplish spe-
cific goals and objectives. Informal groups can transcend formal groups 
by involving relationships inside and outside the project. These relation-
ships in informal groups can affect how people on a project work together. 
The challenge comes when the informal relationship become so intense 
that it may actually impede the performance of a project. For example, 
ethics transgressions can occur that can potentially put the project man-
ager crosswise with the team.
1.3.2  Culture
Project managers and team members are strongly influenced by the cumu-
lative beliefs, values, norms, mores, procedures, practices, stories, and 
habits that occur in their environment. Culture can sometimes become 
quite oppressive, influencing decisions and actions taken to deal with ethi-
cal dilemmas. A strongly autocratic, hierarchical organization can cause 
project managers and team members to circumvent controls, resulting 
in ethical transgressions that can in part provide an excuse for unethical 
decisions and actions. However, a strongly democratic organization can 
provide immense peer pressure. For example, groupthink can cause proj-
ect managers and team members to make unethical decisions.
1.3.3  Power
As a British foreign minister in the early part of the previous century said, 
“Absolute power corrupts absolutely.” Power can make people do things 
that they would not ordinarily do simply because the consequences of its 
exercise can become quite severe.
Power is the ability to influence means and outcomes, and it exists on an 
institutional and personal level. From an institutional standpoint, power 
can originate from the top, middle, and bottom layers. For example, power 
from the top can come from the board of directors; from the middle it 
could be senior management; and from the lower levels it could come from 
labor unions. From a personal perspective, power can take the form of five 
powers, as identified by the French and Raven* model: legitimate, reward, 
*	 Rita Mulcahy, PMP Exam Prep, 6th ed. (Minnetonka, MN: RMC Publications, 2009), 236. 

8  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
coercive, expert, and referent. For example, persons in a position of formal 
authority can exercise power due to their legitimacy within the organiza-
tion; persons with reward power can influence outcomes through the use 
of incentives; or persons with a charismatic personality can dictate out-
comes through the manipulation of others.
Ethics and power often go hand in hand because the latter can dictate 
the former. For example, the tone at the top can permeate the ranks of 
an organization. If the tone is negative, then ethical considerations could 
become a lower priority than if the tone is positive (not the same as per-
missive). Effective project managers are always attuned to the contextual 
atmosphere, both vertically and laterally. They know that a negative atmo-
sphere can affect how decisions are made and what actions are taken to 
deal with ethical issues.
1.3.4  Competition
While competition offers many benefits, it also can lead to dysfunctional 
decision making and behavior on projects. Just to name a few, if not man-
aged properly, competition can lead to accusatorial behavior, a win–lose 
perspective, a lack of sharing information, and a dearth of collaboration 
among stakeholders.
When competition becomes intense, just to get the advantage some 
people can start taking shortcuts that can lead to ethical transgressions. 
Power struggles can surface, thereby pitting one or more team members 
against another. Peer group pressures can cause talented people to leave, 
resulting in mediocrity, a result contrary to what competition is all about.
1.3.5  Rewards
Positive and negative rewards play an instrumental role in affecting 
ethical decisions and behavior. Rewards are perhaps one of the stron-
gest influences on ethics. While positive rewards often have the intent 
of encouraging likewise behavior, sometimes just the opposite happens. 
The rewards can be so positive that people are willing to suspend ethical 
judgment and behavior on the simple notion that the gain will somehow 
compensate for the transgression. For example, a substantial bonus can 
cloud people’s judgment and allow them to make questionable decisions. 
Negative rewards can also cause people to suspend ethical judgment and 

Ethics and Project Management  •  9
behavior to avoid pain, such as the loss of a contract or justifying lying 
to prevent penalties being levied against the company, thereby resulting 
in disbarment from participating in government contracts. Regardless of 
whether it is a positive or negative incentive, the potential for ethical prob-
lems can and often does arise.
1.3.6  Experiences
The past can become a great teacher; it can also set a bad precedent. 
Sometimes experience performing an ethical transgression can prove 
quite valuable, especially if it had gone undetected or was encouraged and 
involved no punishment. Under such circumstances, project managers 
may have survived one or two projects using ethical transgressions. Success 
in this regard does not justify such transgressions. Instead, it simply means 
that the project managers or team members did not “get caught.” Examples 
include not reporting a problem and falsifying charging practices. Project 
managers may have decided to ignore the problem or simply covered up the 
situation. Regardless, their decision or action may have gone unnoticed, 
thereby encouraging them to behave similarly on a future project.
1.3.7  Role Expectations
On a project, everyone has a role, with some more important than others 
depending on the circumstances. Accompanying each role are expecta-
tions that may be set by other stakeholders or sometimes by a professional 
society or some other institution. Whatever the origins, the expectations 
can put a tremendous load on what that person is supposed to do or not 
supposed to do. Project managers are constantly placed in the unique 
position of having to fulfill the expectations of more than one stakeholder, 
which can put tremendous pressure on them with limited authority. Often, 
these expectations are formal.
In some circumstances, role expectations are not formal but informal, 
often based on the precedent of a predecessor or the general tone of higher 
management. For example, the project manager may be expected to prefer 
the stick over the carrot in motivating team members. Under such cir-
cumstances, if pressure exists then project managers may take unethical 
measures to remove a team member, through vilification or modifying 
reports to please certain powerful stakeholders.

10  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
1.3.8  Structure
The structure of an organization can influence ethical decision making and 
actions, particularly when an ethical transgression occurs. A centralized orga-
nization, for example, may assume all responsibilities for decisions and actions 
related to ethics, which can lead to an upward delegation of ethical responsi-
bilities. This would allow, however unintentional, resulting in people awaiting 
a decision on dealing with an ethical dilemma. A decentralized organization, 
for example, has the potential opposite situation. The lower-level organiza-
tions may decide to keep ethical situations or transgressions under the radar, 
leaving the higher organization unaware of what is happening.
1.3.9  Management Style
The impact of management style can be hard to detect, yet it has profound 
consequences. Management style exercised throughout the ranks of an 
organization can influence ethical decision making and behavior. The 
tone at the top can influence ethics and can be reflected in formal docu-
mentation, including policies, procedures, and organization charts, or in 
the ways of doing business, including how management interacts with the 
rank and file and how it encourages problem solving.
Likewise, tone on the project can influence ethical decisions and behav-
ior. A project manager’s demeanor can sway the conduct of business, but 
so can the thoughts and behavior of the team and other stakeholders. 
For example, groupthink can become so strong that it can actually cause 
people to make decisions and act in ways that they would ordinarily not 
do, some of which result in ethical transgressions. According to a survey 
by Crucial Skills Newsletter, 78 percent of the respondents indicated that 
their current project is “doomed” and only about 10 percent felt they could 
freely discuss the dismal fate of their projects.*
1.4  COMMON TERMINOLOGY
Ethics, as defined in this book, is exercising objective judgment on what is 
the right decision and response when dealing with ethical situations after 
*	 “We’re All Doomed Unless You Start Talking,” PM Network (June 2007), p. 18.

Ethics and Project Management  •  11
considering all options. The topic of ethics involves a host of terminol-
ogy that is highly interrelated and integrated. Some of the more common 
terms discussed in this chapter are rights, loyalty, trust, morality, virtue, 
honesty, and integrity (Figure 1.1).
1.4.1  Values
One of the essential elements of ethics is having a set of values to help 
you determine the appropriate decision and response to an ethical situa-
tion. Values, based on beliefs acquired over a period of time, help you to 
distinguish between good and bad or right and wrong. Values are really 
beliefs exhibited when dealing with ethical situations but also when con-
ducting normal business. As Joseph DesJardins notes in An Introduction 
to Business Ethics, “Ethical values are those standards that include us to 
act in ways that impartially promote human well being.”*
Often values are not clear-cut but overlap with one another, and this 
conflict surfaces when you must deal with an ethical decision. The conflict 
in values may be over how to resolve conflict among stakeholders or over 
how to communicate bad news that reflects negatively on the performance 
not only of the project but also of the project manager, too.

1.4.2  Trust
Vanessa Hall defines trust in her book, The Truth about Trust in Business, 
as “the ability to rely on a person, company, product, or service to deliver 
an outcome.”* It involves being able to depend on someone to consistently 
exhibit behavior that is honest, straightforward, and reliable. Trust is 
important at all levels of a project. Stakeholders must be able to trust each 
other, team members must be able to trust their project manager and vice 
versa, and team members must be able to trust each other.
Projects lacking trust exhibit some common characteristics. Stakeholders 
focus on covering your backside rather than accomplishing the mission and 
goals of the project. People do not share information, and, if they do, it is par-
tially released. Individuals do not take the initiative for fear of reprisal either 
from management or peers. The consequences are endless. Trust plays such 
an important role, and when it disappears quite often so does the project.
1.4.3  Honesty
Dealing with ethical situations requires people being truthful in their 
interactions. People express themselves in a way that encourages further 
dialogue and fact finding in contrast to being evasive or telling only part 
of a story. As Stephen M. R. Covey in The Speed of Trust notes about hon-
esty, “…[It] includes not only telling the truth, but also leaving the right 
impression. It’s possible to tell the truth but leave the wrong impression. 
And that’s not being honest.”†
Honesty permeates everything in project management because the focus 
is on achieving results. The opposite of honesty—dishonesty—can have 
serious ramifications on a project. For example, playing with the numbers 
in a way that misleads key stakeholders about the performance of a project 
can result in the project manager losing credibility and can also impact the 
overall performance of the organization. Without honesty, trust declines.
1.4.4  Morality
Morality is a loaded term in just about any environment because of the sub-
jective nature of the topic. Regardless, it is fair to say that it consists of the

customers, habits, and values of a person or organization and is reflected 
in examining how it makes decisions and takes action when dealing with 
ethical situations. Notes DesJardins in An Introduction to Business Ethics, 
“Morality [refers] to those aspects of ethics involving personal, individual 
decision-making.”* An important consideration when looking at morality 
is the degree to which a person or organization has a sensitivity to moral 
considerations. A high level of sensitivity is good; a low sense can lead to 
ethical transgressions.
Morality plays an important role on projects because it is exhibited in the 
way of doing business. If morality is low then trust, honesty, integrity, and 
fairness are just some of the victims. Backstabbing, finger pointing, infor­
mation hoarding, and hidden agendas become the norm rather than the 
exception. As a result, a project is destined to fail under those circumstances.
1.4.5  Character
Character consists of many of the elements discussed already and essen-
tially is the traits or qualities an individual or organization possesses that 
are exhibited when making decisions and taking action. Character is a 
key topic in leadership in general and ethics in particular. It is evident by 
exhibiting a standard of behavior.
Character on an individual basis has been discussed in leadership 
books across a wide spectrum of disciplines. Character is molded over 
time through the totality of knowledge and experience and provides 
a frame of reference for dealing with ethical situations. “The endur-
ing marker or etched-in factors in our personality, which includes our 
inborn talents as well as the learned and acquired traits imposed upon 
us by life and experience. These engravings define us, set us apart, 
and motivate behavior,” writes Joanne Ciulla in Ethics: The Heart of 
Leadership.† People are often described as having good, bad, strong, or 
weak character, and this influences how they will respond to an ethical 
situation. Clearly, persons of good or strong character will do what is 
appropriate and will take the high road; persons of bad or weak charac-
ter will perform ethical transgressions.
Organizations have character, too, which is exhibited by the decisions 
and actions taken in response to ethical situations. Policies, procedures, 
*	 DesJardins, Introduction to Business Ethics, p. G3.

14  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
norms, and morals give a strong indication of an organization’s character. 
This trait is also exhibited through the tone at the top, that is, how the 
executive leadership conducts its business.
From a project management perspective, character is critical to the suc-
cessful completion of a project. Project managers must possess an ethical 
character if they hope to be effective. Failure to exhibit good character can 
result in loss of credibility and trust with all stakeholders. Team members 
should possess good character; otherwise, a project will be plagued with 
overt and subtle problems related to human relations.
1.4.6  Virtue
Virtue is one of the traits or characteristics that make up the character 
of the individual or organization. A virtuous person, for example, is said 
to possess moral sensitivity, an internal moral framework, integrity, and 
trustworthiness. A virtuous organization shares many of the same traits 
or characteristics.
Virtue is exhibited through actions. It is not enough simply to claim to 
be virtuous. Virtues, a key element of character, are, according to Craig 
Johnson in Ethics in the Workplace, “deep rooted dispositions, habits, 
skills, or traits of character that incline persons to perceive, feel, and act 
in ethically right and sensitive ways.”* It requires exhibiting traits or char-
acteristics consistently when confronting ethical situations, especially 
difficult ones dealing with ethical transgressions. When ethical transgres-
sions are obvious, such as a team member falsifying labor charging, it does 
not take much ethical fortitude to take appropriate action; it takes cour-
age, however, to act ethically in response to an ethical situation where the 
issues are gray rather than black or white.
1.4.7  Fairness
Also known as equity, fairness involves being able to weigh the circum-
stances of an ethical situation when making a decision and taking action 
in a manner that is just to all parties. It requires, for example, creating a 
balance by distinguishing facts from assumptions to derive an equitable 
resolution to a problem. O. C. Ferrell, John Fraedrich, and Linda Ferrell 
*	 Johnson, Ethics in the Workplace, pp. 41–42.

Ethics and Project Management  •  15
define fairness in Business Ethics as “the quality of being just, equitable, 
and impartial.”*
Project managers exercise fairness throughout a project simply because 
they are often dealing with a large number of stakeholders and resolving 
conflict among them. This conflict may arise over schedules, resources, 
strategic priorities, or personalities, just to name a few. Project managers 
must balance interests in a way that hopefully results in a fair outcome for 
all parties, something akin to a win–win rather than win–lose result.
1.4.8  Integrity
Closely related to character, integrity is the manifestation of character. It is 
the cumulative beliefs and values of individuals, how they tie motive and 
action. There “…is no gap between intent and behavior,” says Covey. “…When 
he or she is whole, seamless, the same—inside and out.”† In other words, indi-
viduals with integrity walk the talk. Integrity is a window into the psyche 
of individuals and reveals their ethics, indicating just how much others can 
believe and trust them. People with integrity reflect a consistency between 
belief and values by always doing the right but not necessarily the easy deci-
sion or action required to address an ethical situation or transgression. When 
individuals lack integrity is when other people really appreciate its impor-
tance; you lose faith, trust, and credibility in them, and it is very difficult to 
restore. Sacrifice integrity, and project managers will experience the same fate 
and may never regain the faith, trust, and credibility of your stakeholders.
Not convinced that integrity is important? According to a recent survey 
by IBM, global senior leaders in the public and private sectors identified 
integrity as one of the top five leadership qualities over the next five years.‡
1.5  THEORETICAL UNDERPINNINGS
Although this book focuses on the practical application of ethics in a proj-
ect environment, it is still important to understand at a rudimentary level 
the theoretical underpinnings behind the subject.

16  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
The field of ethics goes back to the days of the Greeks and involves such 
notables as Plato, Socrates, and Aristotle, to name just a few. Questions of 
morality, justice, truth, honesty, virtue, and ethics commonly occupied 
their thoughts. In some cases, some ancient Greeks took their concepts 
to the extreme; for example, Diogenes walked around carrying a lantern 
looking for an honest man. To a large extent, with the exception of men 
like Diogenes, their focus in regards to ethics was based on the notion of 
moderation or balance, in what Aristotle referred to as the golden mean.
Over time, such discussion evolved into what is known as moral phi-
losophy, that is, the purpose of morality with ethics becoming a major 
subject. Two camps arose in regards to ethics.
Deontological ethics is associated with one’s particular behavior in 
regards to ethics. This behavior is based on universal truths or principles 
that identify what decisions and actions should and should not do. The 
focus is more on duty, exhibited through the adherence to these univer-
sal truths acquired through intuition or reason. Deontological ethics were 
best articulated by Immanuel Kant,* who developed the idea of categorical 
imperative, which essentially emphasizes duty and principles over other 
considerations (e.g., consequences). Project managers often get involved 
in deontological ethics. From an ethical perspective, some universal 
truths should be followed regardless of circumstances. For example, proj-
ect managers should report honestly; they should treat all team members 
with respect; they should serve as trustees of a company’s resources.
Teleological ethics emphasizes the desired results to achieve, that is, plac-
ing importance on the consequences when dealing with ethical situations. 
Utilitarianism is a common philosophy articulated by Jeremy Bentham 
and John Stuart Mills.† From an ethical perspective, the emphasis is on 
the consequences, for example, the greatest good for the greatest number 
or some other desired result. Project managers often get involved in teleo-
logical ethics. They have to deal with ethical situations. For example, they 
may have to deal with negative conflict among stakeholders and deter-
mine whose interests outweigh the others for the good of the project; they 
may have to weigh whether to develop in-depth plans is really necessary 
when considering the impact to the greater good of the project.
*	 DesJardins, Introduction to Business Ethics, 38-39. 
†	 DesJardins, Introduction to Business Ethics, 87-90.

Ethics and Project Management  •  17
These two philosophical camps set the stage for a discussion of ethics, 
leading to more discrete perspectives on ethics, usually involving making 
a choice regarding ethical situations. These dilemmas include determining 
whether to emphasize the individual or the group, means or ends, determin-
ism or free will, public versus private gain, and absolutism versus relativism.
One of the more contemporary ethical dilemmas is the discussion over 
ethical absolutism or ethical relativism and cultural centralism or cul-
tural relativism. The fundamental issue surrounding ethical absolutism 
versus ethical relativism is whether certain ethical values are applicable 
universally across time and place or whether their application depends on 
circumstances. The fundamental issue surrounding cultural centralism 
versus relativism is whether one’s own culture is superior and therefore 
exercised universally, whereas the cultural relativism entails not adhering 
to the idea that universal cultural beliefs and values exist. As globalism has 
an increasing presence, project managers will inevitably become involved 
with issues related to ethical and cultural absolutism and rela­tivism and 
will have to determine whether, for example, their own cultural values 
take precedent over another culture or whether to adapt to another com-
pany’s or country’s ethical standards.
1.6  FINAL THOUGHTS
People have difficulty agreeing on the definition of ethics simply because 
of its abstractness. Yet, when an ethical failure occurs, everyone recog-
nizes it as such; the consequences become tangible and real. The key is 
to have an agreed on definition and then to apply it to ethical situations 
and transgressions on your project. With that definition in hand, you will 
then be able to address ethical concerns with consistency, confidence, 
and competency.

Why Ethics Should Matter 
to Project Managers
Let’s face it: Project managers have one of the hardest jobs in the world, 
simply because it is unique. In an age of specialization they are likely to be 
surrounded by people with a narrow disciplinary focus while they must 
have a broader perspective. Project managers work from a different—not 
necessarily higher—position that requires a different perspective. That’s 
what makes them unique in one way. Other special circumstances, too, 
can contribute to ethical failure in judgment when dealing with ethi-
cal dilemmas.
2.1  UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES
Project managers work with different stakeholders, that is, persons or orga-
nizations that have a direct or indirect interest in the outcome of their proj-
ect. They may deal with executives or managers from their organization or 
even those outside of it. They may deal with vendors or suppliers as well as 
people spanning a wide spectrum, from security to marketing to informa-
tion systems and finance. This unique set of circumstances can cause ethi-
cal dilemmas to occur quickly easily. For example, some executives may be 
more powerful than the customer and, thereby, pressure the team or the 
project manager to put the customer’s interests aside even though the cus-
tomer is paying for the project. Unique circumstances may encourage team 
members to get too close with suppliers, thereby weakening or destroying 
objectivity and independence as well as reining the charge of conflict of 
interest when agreements are made with one vendor or another.

22  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
Chances are that project managers have responsibility without commen-
surate authority. Unless they find themselves in a “projectized” environ-
ment (meaning they have functional command and control over people, 
which is a rare circumstance), they are responsible for a work statement 
for which they have little or no control over the resources. This is often 
the case in a matrix environment, whereby the project manager relies on 
functional management and the sponsor to garner the financial or in-kind 
support to help complete a project. Such pressure can lead to actions, such 
as mischarging, to move the project along rather than to adhere to estab-
lished policies and procedures by following labor charging practices or 
management’s direction.
Another unique characteristic of a project is the pressure to achieve 
results in a relatively short period of time. Project managers and their 
team have to deliver a product or service in a prescribed time period. In 
the contemporary environment, that is not an easy task. In an age of faster, 
better, and cheaper, especially in the hi-tech arena, delays can be costly. 
Managers have to be quick and accurate from technical, cost, and schedule 
perspectives. Any delay can have negative impacts for the project and the 
company. This places immense pressure on project managers and their 
team. Since they likely do not have command and control over resources, 
the ground has potentially been laid to cut corners, which, in turn, can 
cause ethical situations and ethical transgressions to occur. For example, 
project managers or their team may decide to reduce the quality via a 
quick fix even though everyone knows of the long-term consequences to 
the public.
Still another unique position of project managers is that though the 
project is short-term many of their decisions can have long-term conse-
quences. Whatever managers and their team decide today will likely have 
an impact on the project some time after delivering the product or service 
to the customer. A decision to change scope or content of the product or 
service, even if it goes under change control, will likely have an impact 
throughout the supply chain at one time or another. Developing new drugs 
is a prime example where, despite rigorous testing, without even realizing 
it a decision can lead to harmful effects, such as birth deformities. This 
unique circumstance can lead to ethical failure because the pressure is to 
deliver by a certain date and within a certain cost. Some project managers 
can become so focused that they make a decision to meet immediate needs 
only to discover later on, usually from the customer or product manager, 
the decision’s negative ramifications.

Temporary relationships are another unique circumstance of a project 
manager. By its very nature, a project is temporary, and what comes with 
it are relationships. Team members come together hopefully with a com-
mon purpose, and once achieved they go back to their organizations or on 
to another project. Relationships are usually temporary, both during and 
after a project. Because of that very impermanence, some team members 
may either feel that the consequences of their actions don’t matter or may 
just not care. Thus, they may say or do something that can be an ethical 
transgression. It is similar to someone doing something in another neigh-
borhood such as littering and then returning to their own, confident that 
they do not need to face the consequences. Some project team members 
can have that attitude, particularly in a matrix environment, predicated 
on the rationale that they can return to their home organization or go 
work on another project.
Another unique circumstance of project managers is that they often 
work in different environments. Some have experience in project manage-
ment in both business and technical environments. Project management 
is one such skill. The challenge is that what is permissible or acceptable 
in one environment may not necessarily be so in another, even within 
the same organization. Variables such as tone at the top, managerial style, 
and way of doing business can vary from one field to another. While this 
versatility enables managers to adapt, they can sometimes misinterpret or 
miscalculate circumstances, resulting in an inadvertent ethical transgres-
sion. An example may be managing a project outside the United States 
and then managing one in the United States. What is acceptable for doing 
business in one country may not necessarily be so in another. Laws and 
cultural behavior often conflict between two countries, leading to an ethi-
cal transgression in one but not in the other.
Project managers find themselves in circumstances that can, even in the 
most subtle ways, cause ethical situations and transgressions to arise. The 
challenge is to be aware of those circumstances and to determine the most 
appropriate ways to deal with such occurrences. Of course, the general 
business environment does not help matters either. Often there are circum-
stances beyond the control of project managers but that are not unique to 
the project environment, including rapidly changing conditions related 
to the market, domestic and international laws and regulations, political 
conditions, exchange rates, technology, consumer behavior, capital avail-
ability, stock market performance, and general economic conditions such 
as inflation or deflation. Such circumstances can lead to ethical lapses. 

24  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
For example, a rapid change in political conditions may lead members of 
a global project to start spreading negative rumors about a member of a 
certain nationality working on their team. Or currency fluctuations can 
cause budgetary belt tightening for some projects without a correspond-
ing slimming of scope, thereby laying the groundwork for mischarging or 
delivering a product that fails to meet standards without any knowledge of 
its poor quality until long after the project ends.
In these circumstances, coupled with a contemporary general business 
environment that seems lax from an ethics perspective, the opportunity 
for ethical failure does not seem too far-fetched. Surveys have pointed out 
the general laxity that exists in American culture. Several surveys by the 
Ethics Resource Center of the Society for Human Resource Management 
indicate that the following ethical failure (used in the context of infrac-
tions, from most to least as percentage of responses) by colleagues are: 
lying to supervisors; falsifying records; alcohol and drug abuse; steal-
ing or theft; and gift receipt, caused primarily by considerable pressure 
to achieve financial or business objectives.* In a survey conducted by the 
Ethics Officer Association, close to 50 percent of the respondents noted 
that they had done something illegal or unethical in their organizations.† 
Interestingly, in a study on the United States by a British sociologist 
76 percent of employees saw something illegal or unethical while at work.‡
When considering these special and general circumstances, it is quite 
clear that project environment is a potential hotbed for unethical behav-
ior. Project managers must deal with a plethora of ethical issues and at any 
given time and place can find themselves dealing with an ethical situation 
or transgression related to a particular topic.
2.2  HARD AND SOFT ETHICAL ISSUES
While the list of ethical dilemmas is innumerable and overlap with each 
other in many respects, most can be divided into two general ethical cat-
egories: hard and soft. Hard ethical issues can have legal and financial

ramifications and are often quite apparent when a transgression occurs. 
Soft ethical issues can also have financial and legal consequences but 
are often difficult to determine in their occurrence and how to deal with 
them (Figure 2.1). What follows are some common hard ethical issues 
on projects.
Legal noncompliance is an issue that often gets the most attention 
because failure to comply has severe impacts, such as criminal and civil 
penalties, which can be applied to organizations and individuals alike. 
Ensuring adherence to laws and regulations, such as Sarbanes-Oxley, 
Sherman Anti-trust Act, and environmental laws, becomes absolutely 
essential to avoid penalties and bad public relations. Project managers and 
their team members can find themselves legally liable for failing to comply 
with laws and regulations, especially if their actions are not an expres-
sion of due diligence and due care. In recent years, legal and regulatory 
actions have pushed projects to start implementation of project manage-
ment disciplines, if for no other reason than that stakeholders are seeking 
to protect themselves.
No due diligence and due care is one that is related to legal compliance. 
Due diligence is establishing standards, procedures, and responsibilities 
to prevent illegal and unethical behavior; due care is taking all the reason-
able and necessary precautions to preclude harm. It is the result of due 
diligence being applied in reality through consistent activity and follow-
up. Failure to take “reasonable” behavior and action to prevent harm can, 
from a legal perspective, place all stakeholders in harm’s way.

26  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
Arbitrary employment at will is another one that involves deals with the 
contractual relationship between employees and their employers. Often 
issues concern the use of certain people based on their contract and their 
being removed from a project. Depending on the contractual provi-
sions, dismissal has to be handled very carefully. How people are hired or 
released from a project depends not only on whether they are consultants 
or contractors but also on whether labor agreement restrictions exists as 
well as aspects of equal opportunity and affirmative action.
Lack of employee rights covers a wide breadth of topics and includes 
right to privacy, such as use of equipment for personal means, and intel-
lectual property, such as who owns what if a project results in a patent. 
Employee rights can be a very murky issue in the project environment 
since in many cases contract employees and consultants are used. In some 
cases, how these two categories of workers are applied on a project can 
have, for example, tax and benefit consequences for an employer.
Inadequate employee health and safety can have a big impact on a proj-
ect’s work environment. Projects must often, for instance, focus on issues 
like carpel tunnel syndrome, hazard material (hazmat) handling of sub-
stances, construction of facilities such as lead and asbestos poisoning, and 
workplace violence.
Breach of contracts and agreements involves negotiating contracts 
or enforcing compliance with contracts both from a buyer and seller 
perspective. Project managers must also provide the necessary over-
sight and, if necessary, terminate a relationship for breach of contract. 
Agreements, of course, might include a project charter and memoran-
dums of understanding.
Bribes and kickbacks are quite common and are hard to prove. A bribe or 
a kickback is used to eradicate impartiality in any decision-making pro-
cess or to obtain favorable treatment in exchange for something of value. 
Project managers of projects that serve as prime contractors or manage 
a government project must be aware of the potential for bribes and kick-
backs to arise.
Conflicts of interest can challenge an employee’s allegiance to an organi-
zation. Even the mere appearance of a conflict of interest can be a serious 
ethical issue. Project managers must always be on guard for themselves 
and others on their team for potential and actual conflicts of interest. For 
example, employees on a project who participate in a negotiated contract 
with a company in which they own stock have a conflict of interest.

Why Ethics Should Matter to Project Managers  •  27
Mischarging deals with whether team members charge their work or 
services to the appropriate project and even to the right activity within 
a project. Mischarging can become serious business when customers or 
clients end up getting billed for work that they did not contract for and 
will not benefit from. In a matrix environment, team members on a proj-
ect may support several projects, some of which are overhead and some of 
which are directly billable to the customer. Especially on the latter proj-
ects, ethical lapses can arise related to mischarging, such as wrongfully 
billing the government when the work was being done for a private cus-
tomer or client.
Padding and low-balling can also occur. Padding occurs when esti-
mates are artificially inflated for no other reason than to compensate for 
unknowns. The trouble with padding is that it is not based on sound rea-
soning and can lead to overcharging the customer or client for work that 
is not really done. Low-balling is getting a contract with a customer by 
deliberately underbidding to get the contract and then jacking up costs 
once the contract has been signed. While both padding and low-balling 
are not in themselves illegal, they can have unethical implications for proj-
ects. The reasons for this are many, but perhaps the most important one is 
that the contract was not negotiated in good faith. If the customer or client 
finds out about padding or low-balling, trust among all the stakeholders 
can quickly deteriorate, making management of any project difficult.
Insider trading involves people within a corporation sometimes having 
access to privileged information. Sometimes the temptation is very strong 
to use that information to their advantage, such as buying or selling stock 
either of their firm or another company. Stakeholders on a project that 
may involve making a major procurement agreement with another com-
pany could have a substantial impact on the price of its stock. This may 
tempt some team members to use that information to purchase additional 
shares of stock.
Substandard quality may at first not seem like it would involve an ethical 
situation or transgression, it certainly can have an impact if team members 
on a project deliberately fail to comply with standards and requirements. 
Sometimes, under cost and schedule pressures, team members may cir-
cumvent standards to meet the schedule. This circumvention may not be 
apparent at first; however, after project completion it could have severely 
negative effects, such as during sustaining and maintenance operations 
of the product. Knowingly allowing substandard quality workmanship

to occur can mean not only more warranty costs but also those related 
to litigation.
Inaccurate reporting, perhaps from a project management perspective, 
involves one of the most common occurrence of ethical situations and 
transgressions. There are many reasons for this occurrence, especially in 
projects that face an environment of being faster, better, and cheaper. A 
tendency exists to “massage” the numbers or to communicate them in 
such a way that trivializes their impact. A key stakeholder, such as an 
executive, may take the numbers and then run with only one side of the 
story to satisfy some political requirement. Others may report negative 
information and then alter the results because there “is something wrong 
with the data.” Especially on projects involving intense emotions, a strong 
tendency exists among people to hear what they want to hear and not 
what they need to hear. This situation is especially the case where met-
rics, such as earned value, are lacking on a project instead using subjective 
analysis, such a color-code screen. For example, three colors—red, yellow, 
and green—are used to report progress. Not supported by numbers, the 
project manager may decide to assess the color of the project as green even 
though everyone knows the schedule status is red, cost status is yellow, 
and technical quality is red. This is called watermelon reporting, because 
everything is green on the outside but a different color, such as red, on the 
inside. The project manager may be falsely reporting for all sorts of rea-
sons, but regardless, it borders on being unethical, especially if he or she 
knows the true status but reports otherwise.
Unfair competitive advantage involves stakeholders seeking informa-
tion that gives them an opportunity to wipe out the competition to win a 
major contract. Stakeholders may get an advanced copy of a competitive 
bid prior to submittal or hire people from a competitor and pressure the 
new hires to share privileged information from a previous employer that 
results in gaining an advantage. Project managers may face such pressures 
if the contract is quite lucrative to their organization or that it means the 
continuation of an existing contract. Such actions are not just unethical 
but are illegal, too.
Soft ethical issues on projects are more difficult to identify, but are 
significant:
Unbalanced short- and long-term perspectives entails project managers 
deciding to do a quick fix to get them out of trouble in the short-term, 
knowing that it will cause severe problems once the project is over. In other 

Why Ethics Should Matter to Project Managers  •  29
words, they knowingly pass on the problem, and perhaps a bigger one, to 
someone else, such as a product manager or maybe even the customer.
No commitment, responsibility, and accountability is another common 
ethical issue. Commitment is following through on what was promised; 
responsibility is carrying out a commitment; and accountability is holding 
oneself responsible for the results achieved. The ethical issue here is prom-
ising more than what can be delivered, not delivering as promised, and not 
taking responsibility for the results. Too often, especially in the beginning 
of a project, sometimes by design and sometimes by accident key stake-
holders (who include project managers and team members) overcommit 
themselves, thereby later dashing customer expectations. Sometimes proj-
ect managers commit to a schedule that is totally unrealistic. They commit 
to it, but when it is delivery time and a key milestone slides they are the 
first to put the blame on another stakeholder or some other contributor, 
thereby shirking responsibility and accountability.
Repressive culture exists in some environments where the culture can 
become so dominating that no matter what project managers do or say 
their insights are ignored. Culture, as mentioned in the last chapter, is 
reflected in the ways of doing business, from decision making to taking 
action. Extreme pressure can be exerted by senior leadership, so much so 
that the existence of ethical lapses are inevitable. Such conditions can put 
project managers and other project professionals in an ethical precarious 
position. The culture ranges from limiting a project manager’s options to 
changing reports to reflect a story that does not exist.
Extreme behavior involves people exhibiting behavior that reflects their 
beliefs, values, priorities, and overall character. In some environments the 
only acceptable behavior is the one that aligns with the culture. For exam-
ple, autocratic, even aggressive behavior by senior management may per-
meate to the project level, resulting in people not sharing information or 
keeping to themselves. Collaboration, communication, and coordination 
become the exception rather than the rule. Project managers who fail to 
exhibit such behavior can be construed as weak or not playing the game. 
Executive management, however, is not solely to blame; some project team 
members may be less than ethical, too. According to a survey by the Ethics 
Resource Center, misconduct has grown between 2000 and 2007. The sur-
vey noted that close to 60 percent of people have seen ethical misconduct 
occur in their workplace.*

30  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
Dysfunctional motivation can arise when positive and negative incentives 
can propel a project to a successful conclusion but can also inadvertently 
encourage behavior that leads to ethical situations and transgressions. 
Positive incentives reinforce or encourage desirable behavior; negative 
ones concentrate on avoiding penalties. Incentives, of course, can also be 
financial and nonmonetary in nature—the former being an award for out-
standing performance and the latter the opportunity for greater visibility 
for an advancement. Regardless of how classified, sometimes incentives 
encourage the wrong behavior. For example, an award given to certain 
team members may encourage backstabbing and other negative behavior 
from other team members. Some team members may alter reports to give 
the impression that performance is better than what it really is; others may 
perform lower during the day and work harder in the evening to be paid at 
higher rates, thereby inflating project costs.
Performance pressure is another common ethical issue. Crashing and 
fast tracking are two examples that place considerable pressure on projects 
to perform according to expectations. The pressure can come from many 
directions. As mentioned previously, project managers and other stake-
holders may find it necessary to cut corners to meet cost or schedule targets 
or both, which may result in future problems long after completing a proj-
ect. Pressure can be good, but there is a certain threshold that, once bro-
ken, will cause people to do what they can to survive. Some of these actions 
include finger pointing, shirking responsibility, sabotaging other people’s 
work, and vilifying the character of some people. Interestingly, planning 
itself can be a major pressure cooker for project managers. According to 
an online survey by the Project Management Institute (PMI), for project 
managers planning is the most stressful process, followed by, from most 
to least, execution, monitoring and controlling, initiating, and closing.*
Competing priorities also confront stakeholders. Some of them feel 
their priorities are more important than others. To some stakeholders 
cost is more important; other stakeholders may feel that the schedule 
is important. Still others might emphasize quality. The problem is that 
project managers must constantly reconcile all these and other factors 
(e.g., scope and risk). Trying to resolve prioritization may lead to mak-
ing decisions that could unfairly impact the expectations of a stake-
holder. If people fail to inform a specific stakeholder that expectations 
will not be met, the level of trust and integrity afforded to the project

manager could be negatively impacted. Dealing with the varying pri-
orities of different stakeholders is one of the hardest tasks of a project 
manager. Of course, project managers should always decide in favor of 
the customer.
Poor communication is one of the most prevalent soft ethical issues. 
According to the PMI, project managers communicate 90 percent of their 
time with other stakeholders. If that is the case, it is quite clear that project 
managers should do nothing to hurt their credibility. When communi-
cating, therefore, they should be open and responsive to questions and 
insights. Communications should be vertical and horizontal so that no 
one feels out of the loop. Project managers who fail to tell the truth stand 
a good chance of being discovered by the recipients and thus ruining their 
integrity. Honest and open communications, short of privileged informa-
tion, should be a cardinal rule. Project managers who lose credibility will 
lose the project.
2.3  CONSEQUENCES OF ETHICAL FAILURE
When ethical dilemma arise, project managers need to take them on 
directly. Failure to act can have severe consequences.
Tarnished reputation is one consequence. If ethical transgressions go 
unaddressed, some stakeholders may not hold the project manager, the 
project, or the organization in very high regard. Managers will then find it 
difficult to get the support required to complete the project because people 
have lost faith in delivering what was promised.
Tarnished credibility is another consequence. Credibility is extremely 
important, and not just the project manager’s. Team members need to 
maintain their credibility with other stakeholders because they are rep-
resentatives of the project. Managing a project with little or no credibility 
can only result in poor outcome for the project.
Hindered careers can have an impact. An ethical situation or transgres-
sion left unattended can cause people to construe project managers as 
being weak, lacking ethical character, or simply being neglectful about 
something that should have been stopped.
Legal consequences is the final one. If the project manager, as either a 
participant or a witness, knows an ethical situation or transgression has 
occurred and does nothing to rectify it, he or she could experience legal 

32  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
recourse. Project managers are responsible for the overall performance of 
the team; allowing ethical situations or transgressions is, in many regards, 
a failure in due diligence, due care, and, most importantly, leadership.
2.4  CLOUDY PERSPECTIVE
Dealing with ethical failure is one of the most difficult responsibilities that 
project managers have to perform. The project environment frequently 
requires making tough decisions. The toughest are the ethical ones, often 
because the decision and action of dealing with an ethical situation or 
transgression is hardly straightforward. Short of something blatant—overt 
bribery or mischarging, for instance—acquiring a clear picture based on 
facts and data is difficult to achieve. Often, project managers have to shift 
through a sea of subjectivity, half-truths, and assumptions treated as facts 
and data. There are several reasons for this difficulty.
One, project managers, like everyone else, are a product of their back-
ground. Whether they admit it, their prejudices, especially when dealing 
with people issues, can cloud their judgment without really knowing it. 
A kind of value screen sometimes filters out the data of a given situation, 
resulting in a biased result. For example, a project manager who is highly 
experienced in a specific discipline may run a project in another new 
field of endeavor, in which certain facts and data about an ethical trans-
gression are overlooked and, consequently, not considered when making 
a judgment.
Two, as much as project managers may try, they will find that they can-
not release themselves from their current time and place. The pressures, 
some overt and many subtle, will influence their attempt to be objective in 
making a decision about and acting on an ethical situation or transgres-
sion. Both the internal and external environment can have a major impact 
on their thought processes. For example, the temper of the times in the 
past might be considered an ethical transgression, but in the current envi-
ronment it is no longer considered very important.
Three, project managers may never have enough facts and data or may 
have a lot of both. However, neither one may suffice because the known 
facts and data may be only partial. Indeed, what is construed as a fact 
or datum is a really a human deconstruction of phenomena in the world 
and attempting to put what we know in human terms. This very act is, by 

Why Ethics Should Matter to Project Managers  •  33
its nature, subjective, especially when dealing with issues related to the 
human race. By deriving a fact or datum, project managers are by the very 
act deciding to exclude other considerations they deem either as insignifi-
cant or as an assumption.
Four, dealing with ethical situations and transgressions may require 
collecting facts and data, but in the end it calls for judgment over deter-
mining what is right and wrong. There are many schools of thought about 
whether there are absolute or relative truths when discussing ethics, but 
it is clear that ethics requires making one or more judgments that are, by 
their very nature, subjective. For example, what is the difference between 
a minor ethical transgression and a major one? Oftentimes, the line of 
demarcation is unclear.
Five, a key consideration when addressing an ethical situation or trans-
gression is the frame of reference. This is like a paradigm or model on 
how project managers view the world. It determines what they deem is 
important and, conversely, unimportant. It is what they determine are the 
priorities, facts, and data in a given circumstance. It helps them deal with 
ambiguity but at a cost—introducing a bias that affects their objectivity. 
The challenge is to rise above the constraints of their paradigm, to make a 
decision and take an action, or both to make a fair judgment.
The influence of a paradigm will affect what is referred to as ethical con-
sciousness—that is, what project managers believe is moral, immoral, or 
amoral. In a sense it serves as a moral compass that helps to distinguish 
among the three and then to make an appropriate decision about or tak-
ing action.
Regardless of the paradigm, project managers will find that they are 
likely to have to face an ethical situation or transgression more often than 
they wish. Probably most of the ethical decisions and actions are really 
quite simple; that is, the ethical steps to take are quite clear. In other words, 
the answer is between black and white. It does not really present a challenge.
2.5  THE ETHICAL DILEMMA
The challenge occurs when project managers face an ethical dilemma. That 
is, they have to make a decision and action that goes down one path or the 
other. Either way, positives and negatives exist, and there is no choice but 
to choose one. Everything then becomes a matter of gray rather than black 

34  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
and white. In other words, project managers face an ethical moment of 
truth, which then becomes a test of character.
Of course, when dealing with such situations they will use their beliefs 
and values, moral standards, and sense of what is right and wrong to help 
them discern the appropriate decision or action when dealing with an eth-
ical issue or transgression. But that may not help managers to overcome 
the moral conflict rattling through their brain.
An ethical dilemma is tough. A typical one requires them to make a 
choice to do something (i.e., take action), referred to in this book as Path A, 
or not do something, Path B (Figure 2.2). Path A involves taking action, 
perhaps in a proactive way—something that resolves a potential ethical 
situation. Going down Path A has its merits; it may also have its costs. For 
example, a project manager may decide to do something to preclude an 
ethical situation occurring on her project. Such an action demonstrates 
the value she puts on a certain action and to reduce the risk that some-
thing might happen. It also involves incurring up-front costs. Nothing 
comes free.
Path B involves deciding not to take action to deal with a potential ethi-
cal situation or transgression. Going down path B has its merits; it may 
have its costs, too. For example, a project manager may make no decision 
or take no action to deal with a possible ethical situation or transgression. 
The positive is that by making no decision or taking no action, he gives 
the circumstance time to work itself out; if it should occur, possibly no one 
will find out. The negative side is that the situation occurs and goes beyond 
his control.

Picking Path B over Path A does not necessarily mean tolerating unethi-
cal decisions and actions—quite the contrary.
Picking Path B simply means it is a strategy for dealing with the possibil-
ity that an ethical situation or transgression may occur. If one or the other 
occurs, the ethical situation or transgression may not be serious enough 
to require making a choice. Choosing Path A or Path B, therefore, requires 
judgment. So what are the considerations for choosing Path A or Path B?
2.6  TWO KEY CONSIDERATIONS
There are two major considerations when dealing with an ethical dilemma: 
(1) the sensitivity of the issues; and (2) the intensity of the response. 
Both play an integral part in assessing and dealing with ethical failures 
(Figure 2.3):
	
1.	Sensitivity of issue: Sometimes an ethical situation or transgression 
may not warrant the attention it deserves; other times it does. In 
other words, not all ethical situations and transgressions are equal. 
You have to determine the gravity of the situation or transgres-
sion, which will help you to decide on the appropriate response. For 
example, you figure out that one of the team members “fudged” his 
reporting but it did not have a material impact on the reporting.

36  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
	
2.	Intensity of response: Some responses have greater weight than oth-
ers; in fact, some could be overkill for the nature and type of an ethi-
cal situation and transgression that has occurred. A response is a 
conscious effort to make or not make a decision or act. Using the 
example in the previous paragraph, the project manager decides 
simply to talk to the person who “fudged” his reporting rather than 
elevate it up to his management.
Several factors should be considered when deciding both the sensitivity 
of an ethical situation or transgression and its intensity of response:
•	 Magnitude of issue: Is it a major ethical concern or a minor one? 
Obviously, if it is a blatant violation of the law or can result in dam-
aging other people to a significant degree, it surely is a major ethi-
cal situation or transgression and requires action. If, on the other 
hand, it involves something minor like running a single paper copy 
of a personal nature on a company copier, it may not warrant taking 
action at all.
•	 Scalability of issue: Does the issue concern one individual or a large 
number of people? Of course, the involvement of one person may be 
of significance if, for example, that person is embezzling money from 
the company. However, if the person is doing something like taking 
an hour off without telling anyone on a periodic basis it may not 
impact anyone, and addressing the issue may create more problems 
than it is worth.
•	 Context of occurrence: Although circumstances do not excuse uneth-
ical behavior, they need to be examined. For example, was the ethi-
cal situation or transgression done under a moment of duress and 
fear? Sometimes people make decisions and take action, doing some-
thing unethical without realizing it at the time. The project manager 
decides which path to take depending on the magnitude of the ethi-
cal situation or transgression.
•	 Ramification of actions: Sometimes taking an action may cause more 
problems than doing nothing at all. The project manager may elect 
to address an ethical situation or transgression, and the very act 
itself may cause an ethical situation or transgression. He may hear

propriate; he also may know that the person is unpopular on the 
team and that the comment could possibly be an effort to impugn

the person’s character. Taking Path A could turn what was a minor 
issue into a major event that alienates the entire team.
•	 Control over the situation: The origins for the unethical behavior 
may be beyond the project manager’s area of control. She may have 
some control or none at all. Her power to determine whether to pur-
sue Path A or Path B may be minimal. For example, the tone at the 
top may be so overwhelming that she may find that addressing an 
unethical decision or taking an action is irrelevant.
•	 Accident or design: Sometimes, ethical situations and transgressions 
occur without any deliberate intent, such as a failure to report a 
minor wrongdoing. Sometimes, they occur by design, such as delib-
erately producing false reports. In most cases, if an ethical situation 
or transgression occurs by design the project manager needs to make 
a decision and take action.
•	 Facts and data: Oftentimes, emotions run high when ethical situa-
tions and transgressions occur. People can begin to lose trust and get 
defensive; some may start pointing fingers; others may decide to even 
get violent, emotionally or physically. You need to keep your cool and 
determine the who, what, when, where, why, and how about an ethical 
situation. Facts and data are critical to understanding the causes and 
impacts of an ethical situation or transgression because they help in 
allaying the emotion and subjectivity surrounding their occurrence.
•	 Impact to stakeholders: An ethical situation or transgression will have 
a varying impact on stakeholders; in other words, some will be more 
impacted than others. It is best for project managers to determine 
that impact beforehand so they can hopefully determine the cause 
and possible solution for dealing with the ethical issue and trans-
gression. Through involvement, they will reduce resistance to any 
decision or action to address an ethical situation or transgression.
•	 Consequences: The impact will determine whether the ethical situa-
tion or transgression is severe enough to warrant attention and, just 
as importantly, what the appropriate response should be. In other 
words, the penalty, as an old saying goes, should fit the crime. You 
want to avoid overkill; otherwise, addressing the issue could intro-
duce problems that are far more difficult to handle.
•	 Assumptions: A tendency exists to treat assumptions as facts. Often, 
this treatment is done out of ignorance or convenience because it 
requires time and effort to do so. Sometimes, too, time is not avail-
able, which causes people to jump prematurely to conclusions. 

38  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
Assumptions are often intertwined with rationalizations, making 
it very difficult to distinguish fact from fiction. Failure to verify 
assumptions can make it difficult for you to acquire a clear under-
standing of the causes of ethical situations and transgressions and 
develop an appropriate response.
•	 Causes: Determine the causes of an ethical situation and transgres-
sions. When project managers clearly identify the causes, they can 
then determine an effective response. They want to avoid a response 
that will only aggravate the circumstances or that fails to resolve the 
issue. Because emotions are high concerning ethical situations and 
transgressions, they can easily find themselves in a defensive posi-
tion, especially if the decision or action they take or don’t take is the 
wrong response.
•	 Impact of response: If project managers decide to respond, they can 
expect some type of pushback, especially from people who may ben-
efit from an ethical situation or transgression. They cannot avoid it. 
They can even expect resistance from not doing anything because 
some people will find that the ethical situation or transgression hurts 
their interests. The main idea here is TANSTAAFL (“There ain’t no 
such thing as a free lunch”). Whatever the manager’s response, even 
if it means not making a decision or taking action, positive and nega-
tive consequences should be expected.
Both the sensitivity of the issue and the intensity of response require 
making a judgment; no cookie-cutter approach exists. This judgment 
requires looking across a continuum that moves from doing the mini-
mum, balanced, to maximum; the boundaries overlap, indicating that 
project managers will always have to make judgments and adjustments 
depending on the circumstances (Figure 2.4). An example of a minimum

approach is simply asking the person to stop committing the ethical 
transgression. A balanced approach is to have a more in-depth conversa-
tion about the reasons not to commit the transgression. The maximum 
approach is to elevate the issue to management and request a reprimand.
2.7  SENSITIVITY OF ISSUE
For ascertaining the sensitivity of issue, you can:
One, determine if an ethical issue or transgression has in fact occurred. 
Sometimes, what may look like one is really the result of an oversight 
or accident. It makes no sense to treat something as an ethical situation 
or ethical transgression when it really isn’t one. Everyone just becomes 
alarmed and then will focus on protecting themselves rather than on 
completing their work. If the issue isn’t an ethical transgression, it can be 
treated the same as any other problem or issue.
Two, assuming it is an ethical issue, then determine its sensitivity. The 
more sensitive the ethical issue or transgression, the more immediate 
attention it will require. As discussed earlier, an issue of law, such as some-
one receiving kickbacks, requires more attention than someone who runs 
a handful of copies for a religious group on the company copier. Good 
judgment should be used, because once something is given attention it has 
several consequences: Project managers will likely strain their relationship 
with the individual; they may end up imperiling the productivity of that 
individual; or they may encourage a subtle or overt retaliation. While ide-
ally ethical issues or transgressions should never be tolerated, the reality is 
that managers cannot constantly fight them all; otherwise, all their attention 
and energy as well as that of team members, will be dissipated. Managers 
need to pick their battles when it comes to ethical issues and transgressions.
Three, identify the stakeholders involved in an ethical situation or trans-
gression. Project managers need to know who committed it and who is 
impacted by it. Just as important is that they need to know why the person 
did it and how the others were impacted. They will need to know this infor-
mation because it will help them, should they be assigned the responsibil-
ity to conduct investigation behind the causes and to determine if this has 
been a consistent pattern. If someone else does the investigation, such as 
an investigator responding to a hotline call, managers may likely have to 
provide this information anyway.

40  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
Four, conduct the inquiry to collect the relevant facts and data related 
to the ethical situation or transgression. Managers need to know not only 
who was involved and what happened but also the when, why, where, 
and how. These facts and data will help managers to perform the steps 
for addressing the intensity of the response (soon to be discussed). Just as 
importantly, they will help them to perform the next step.
Five, determine whether to personally address the ethical issue or trans-
gression or seek outside help. The fact is that managers can go only so far 
in what they can do without dissipating their energies in managing their 
project or getting themselves embroiled in a legal situation. For simple, 
minor ethical situations or transgressions, their involvement may be okay; 
however, for those that may have severe impacts, they may need to bring 
in their management or make other contacts. It is not advisable to become 
a self-appointed attorney or what was called in the army a “latrine lawyer.”
Six, assuming managers can handle the issue or transgression, they 
should have at this point a good idea as to the cause or causes. Knowing 
the cause or causes helps in determining the appropriate solution. Without 
knowing the cause or causes, they may never really address the ethical 
issue or transgression. For example, they may think they have addressed 
it, but other stakeholders know that the ethical issue or transgression still 
remains. Failure to address the cause will communicate to others only that 
they have—whether true—a tolerance for unethical decisions or actions. It 
is a bad precedent to set.
2.8  INTENSITY OF RESPONSE
For intensity of response, here are the steps, assuming project managers 
are managing the dilemma themselves:
One, meet with the stakeholders who are involved in the ethical situa-
tion or transgression. These are the stakeholders who caused it to happen 
and the ones who are impacted by it. They can be met with individually or 
as a group. Ideally, they should start talking about how to resolve any mis-
understandings and eventually to come up with a solution that addresses 
the causes and, of course, that everyone can live with. If this action is 
taken unilaterally, the project manager will be in a position of a police 
officer enforcing his own solution on others who, quite simply, do not like 

Why Ethics Should Matter to Project Managers  •  41
it. Of course, one of the solutions may be to not do anything but instead 
communicate it up to management or some other route such as a hotline.
Two, assuming everyone agrees to the solution they developed, the goal 
is for them to participate in developing a plan that not only will rectify 
what has occurred but also will ensure that it will not happen again. The 
formality of the plan depends, of course, on the sensitivity of the issue 
or transgression and the degree to which everyone wants to avoid facing 
the same circumstances again. Judgment is critical here because a plan in 
which the cost exceeds the benefits is not desired. Above all, the plan dem-
onstrates that the managers are preparing to resolve the ethical situation 
or transgression. The managers are demonstrating due diligence.
Three, implement the plan that everyone hopefully has reached con-
sensus over. The extent to which the plan is implemented will be directly 
correlated with its effectiveness. Ideally, the plan is simple enough to imple-
ment and may require a simple schedule and a periodic review. A status 
report from key stakeholders should give an idea as to whether the plan 
was implemented. Implementing a plan, albeit even a simple one, com-
municates to everyone that the entire endeavor is more than just going 
through the motions. The project manager and others are committed and 
serious. Most importantly, this step demonstrates due care.
Four, tied closely to the last step, project managers must follow up on the 
effectiveness of the solution and the plan implementing it. In this way they 
are demonstrating to others the importance of the issue and transgres-
sion and its solution. They are also helping to continue focus on complet-
ing the project, not constantly acting as the project’s police officer. The 
effectiveness can often be determined as the plan is implemented. Perhaps, 
however, the two most important follow-up actions that can be done are 
to determine if corrective action is necessary and to implement and con-
duct a “lessons learned” session, which can help in avoiding similar ethi-
cal situations and transgressions and how to effectively deal with similar 
ones in the future.
2.9  FINAL THOUGHTS
Project managers are unique in a sense that they are the only ones who 
function as a hub among all the stakeholders on their projects. They are 

42  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
also the only ones who are postured to see the “big picture”; most others 
have a partial perspective. Coupled with being a hub and having a big pic-
ture perspective is often having little or no formal power and authority to 
deal with hard and soft technical issues. Yet when such issues arise, project 
managers can find their projects, their organizations, and themselves in 
trouble unless they have a model facing ethical dilemmas.

Project Management Code of Ethics
Just about all professions have a code of ethics, and project management is 
no exception. Thanks to organizations like the Project Management 
Institute© (PMI), a code of ethics exists.
In their book Professional Liability and Risk Management, Bruce 
Bennett et al. identified the structure of an ethical framework embod-
ied in a code of ethics. They noted that there is an overall system of 
principles that provides structure for a code of ethics. This structure, 
in turn, is built on a set of principles that comprise the system of ethics. 
The principles allow the development of standards found acceptable to 
authorities and general practices in the field. These standards are fol-
lowed by guidelines, which are really procedures to apply as standards 
in the field.*
3.1  BENEFITS
A code of ethics offers many benefits:
One, it provides a structure that all people in the profession can use to 
make decisions. Today, typical professions exist around the globe. Laws 
and customs as well as how they respond to ethical situations vary. An 
ethical framework works, as long as it is accepted by all or most members 
of a profession, as a means of getting people to operate according to some 
common principles regardless of where they are on the planet.
*	 Bruce Bennett, Brenda Bryant, Gary VandenBos, and Addison Greenwood, Professional Liability 
and Risk Management (Washington, DC: American Psychological Association, 1990), pp. 17–18.

48  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
Two, because it provides a common structure for a profession, it offers 
the potential for a common language from a disciplinary standpoint. 
Whether one speaks Chinese, Swahili, English, or Yiddish, the terms used 
in the code of ethics have a similar meaning, albeit with differences in 
interpretation. All nationalities at least have vocabulary that is considered 
acceptable at a certain level of abstraction.
Three, it provides a way to deal with ethical situations that are grayer 
rather than black and white. Situations arise that are not always clear and 
that require judgment. A code of ethics provides help in making decisions 
and taking the right action under such circumstances. While logic and 
intuition are helpful, a professional sometimes faces situations that require 
the use of a code of ethics to help provide direction.
Four, it provides a sense of community among people in a discipline. 
Regardless of location or ethnicity, a code of ethics serves as a way to bridge 
the gap among them. They adhere to the same principles, to the same tools 
and techniques, and to a common vocabulary. It may seem to create a 
camaraderie or esprit de corps among the members of the profession.
Five, it provides guidelines for disciplining members of the profession 
who fail to adhere to the contents of the code. The principles, standards, 
and guidelines offer a way to determine what is acceptable and not accept-
able according to the code. Transgressions of the code lay the groundwork 
for removing people who fail to live up to its creed.
Six, it keeps the profession alive, meaning that it furthers and encour-
ages dialogue over issues and circumstances that would ordinarily lose 
visibility among the members of the community. Conferences and pub-
lications help to provide that visibility through the discussions of issues 
and circumstances, especially those dealing with ethics, in the forefront 
of people’s minds. This benefit encourages greater dialogue and sharing of 
insights, which contributes to the knowledge base of the entire discipline.
Finally, it enables the transfer of principles and knowledge from one 
generation of members of a discipline to the next. It provides continu-
ity in dealing with issues and circumstances in a way that capitalizes on 
acceptable standards and guidelines. In other words, each generation of 
a discipline does not have to reinvent everything, leading to meaningless 
trial and error and sometimes needless frustration and misery. Instead, 
each succeeding generation can benefit from the principles of the previous 
one when dealing with ethical issues and circumstances.

Project Management Code of Ethics  •  49
3.2  DOWNSIDES
Of course, as with anything, with benefits come some downsides, and a 
code of ethics is no different.
One, it can foster rigidity of thought if the code is inflexible. Tools, con-
cepts, and practices that vary from the principles may be condemned by 
the professional organization, which may lead to an increase in knowl-
edge of the profession or to valuable people leaving the profession to 
apply new tools, concepts, and practices due to the intolerance of the cur-
rent membership.
Two, it may cause some members to interpret principles as simply as 
the “law” and, consequently, to suspend judgment. This lack of judgment 
can cause a lack of feeling on the part of the professional for any sense of 
responsibility for the results. In other words, professionals simply absolve 
themselves from any consequences because they were simply following 
the code of ethics. Or worse, it may serve as an excuse to do something 
that may, ironically, appear unethical.
Lastly, it contains principles and terminology that are often so vague 
that they can be used to justify anything. Professionals in the field can 
cite a passage or term that, depending on its interpretation, provides jus-
tification for their decisions or actions dealing with an ethical issue or 
circumstance.
Essentially, a code of ethics is simply a way to provide professionals with 
a set of principles, standards, and guidelines for dealing with ethical issues 
and circumstances. It does not replace judgment either on an individual or 
group level. It does not offer excuses for making decisions and taking actions 
that harm individuals and threatens the overall public good. In other words, 
it requires that professionals take a sense of personal responsibility for deci-
sions and actions while using it as a framework to exercise judgment.
3.3  CATEGORIES OF PRINCIPLES
As a separate system of principles, project management is a relatively new 
phenomenon, at least in the United States, although in the past it was often 
mixed in with other professions, such as engineering or medicine. The 

50  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
ethical principles that support some of the existing codes of ethics in proj-
ect management can be categorized into 10 groups, as outlined in this 
section. These categories are not mutually exclusive as you might suspect; 
they overlap with each other, and failure of one may and often does infect 
one or more of the others. While there is no particular order to them, 
notice that character is at the top of the list. There is a good reason for this 
(Figure 3.1):

Project Management Code of Ethics  •  51
3.3.1  Character
This one matters a lot, yet unfortunately it often seems to go to the wayside 
for all sorts of reasons discussed in this book. Character traits like cour-
age, honesty, judgment, and sense of right or wrong seem no longer rel-
evant until an ethical situation or transgression arises. While such terms 
are vague and open to interpretation, the reality is that when they fail to be 
exercised on a project they become quite apparent. For example, a project 
manager who lacks courage will often be a weak project manager by not 
addressing issues that should have been addressed. Naturally, these issues 
will lead to problems sometime later during the product or project life 
cycle. The same can be said for honesty; a project manager who fails to be 
honest will lose credibility with stakeholders.
A failure in character will affect all the other ethical categories described 
in the forthcoming paragraphs. It will permeate everything like tainted 
blood corrupting all the organs of the body. For example, dishonesty may 
make it difficult for project managers to share their knowledge; reduce 
their credibility in communicating with stakeholders; lead them to 
wonder whether leadership truly cares about the project; or, trust their 
competency. 
	 A.	Standard: Take the high road at all times.
	
B.	Standard: Be consistent in thought and action.
	 C.	Standard: Exhibit moral as well as physical courage.
Project managers will always have to face a test of character. There will 
be circumstances which will present what seem to be overwhelming odds 
if you follow your own ethical principles or those of your profession. There 
will also be circumstances which will not be so obvious a challenge; they 
may be so subtle that you may not realize it until after the fact. The best 
that project managers can do is ingrain the principles of the profession 
with those of their own to make the best possible judgment.
3.3.2  Career
Project managers have basically three ways to enhance their career: one 
oriented toward themselves and the other two toward their profession:

52  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
•	 Standard: Keep knowledge and expertise up to contemporary stan-
dards, not just for personal reasons but also for the people or orga-
nizations to which services are provided. Actions include taking 
training and seminars on the latest topics affecting the profession; 
reading articles and books related to these and other topics; and 
increasing knowledge and experience of application of concepts, 
principles, techniques, and tools.
•	 Standard: Participate in professional societies or associations related 
to project management. This participation includes sharing knowl-
edge and experiences with colleagues via presentations and papers 
at local chapter meetings and conventions; further imparting back-
ground information through seminars and workshops; holding 
leadership positions within the societies; and keeping abreast of the 
latest principles, standards, and guidelines of the organization.
•	 Standard: Become and stay a member of good standing with the 
society or association, which means following the principles of 
the organization; embodying behavior with these principles in the 
organization and the public; not engaging in activities that use 
the organization for material gain or illegal behavior; not lying 
about or exaggerating knowledge and experience in the field; and 
not accepting positions, based on falsehoods, that clearly go beyond 
knowledge and expertise (unless, of course, those who employ the 
managers’ services are aware of their shortcomings in this regard).
Project managers should be active participants in their profession. 
Failure to get involved hurts themselves and the profession because they 
have experiences and knowledge. They can do so by publishing articles 
and books; teaching at local universities and colleges, and serving as offi-
cers in local chapters of project management societies. 
3.3.3  Competency
Closely related to career is competency—that is, having the knowledge and 
experience to work in the field of project management. Being competent 
in project management, like most professions, requires practical experi-
ence; book learning is not enough. There are ways for project managers to 
demonstrate their competency.

Project Management Code of Ethics  •  53
•	 Standard: Demonstrate due diligence and due care by applying and 
following the processes advocated by the professional societies in 
project management. In other words, project managers should use 
their judgment when applying project management concepts, prin-
ciples, tools, and techniques. Knowing the project life cycle is not 
enough; applying project management knowledge to it is what mat-
ters, and this can come only from experience. For example, project 
managers should always have a charter, work breakdown structure, 
and schedule for a project; otherwise they are being unethical by not 
doing what is expected of them as professionals.
•	 Standard: Avoid taking shortcuts that will have a short-term fix but 
severe long-term consequences to be addressed by someone else. 
This especially has ethical consequences if project managers fail to 
communicate these consequences to the customer. Of course, man-
agers cannot be clairvoyants, but it is unethical to know about these 
consequences and to tell no one.
•	 Standard: Accept responsibility for defects and errors on personal 
projects. Project managers—and no one else—are responsible for the 
overall results of their team. Blaming someone else (which is not the 
same as identifying the source of a problem) is shirking responsibil-
ity. A key point is that managers can delegate work, but they cannot 
do the same with responsibility. Trying to do so will only demon-
strate unwillingness to take ownership.
•	 Standard: Apply the latest developments in the field of project man-
agement; challenge others to do so as well. Always adhering to past 
ways of doing business may actually lead to ineffective and ineffi-
cient execution of a project. New tools and techniques are constantly 
being designed; if they are applicable to the project and can enhance 
its planning and execution, their application needs to be considered. 
This will enhance not only the progress of the project but also the 
perception of the project manager’s competence.
Project managers will always face challenges and opportunities for 
displaying competency in their profession. Many project managers lack 
formal control over the resources to complete their projects. They must 
use a combination of hard (e.g., scheduling) and soft (e.g., negotiation) 
skills to bring their projects to a successful conclusion. To do so requires 

54  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
individuals who not only have theoretical knowledge but also practical 
experience; the combination of the two will enable them to exhibit a com-
petency commensurate with their background for dealing with ethical 
dilemmas and making the right decisions for their projects.
3.3.4  Caretaking
Project managers are given a huge responsibility: They must harness the 
resources given to them by their management and execute projects that 
will achieve the goals and objectives not only of the projects but also of 
the overall organization. This responsibility covers labor (e.g., people) and 
nonlabor (e.g., equipment) resources. Caretaking requires project manag-
ers to take several actions:
•	 Standard: Do not use company resources for managers’ purposes. 
For example, they should not use a resource entrusted to them to add 
value to their own personal resources. They must use the resources to 
further the gains of the project; to do otherwise is a violation of trust. 
Often, people assume that this principle applies only to people in 
public service, but that is not the case. The principle applies to project 
managers of private or public organizations, too. Shareholders and 
other stakeholders have hired them to apply resources to complete 
a project successfully, not to line their coffers with the resources of 
the project in some way.
•	 Standard: Employ resources effectively and efficiently. Effectiveness 
means achieving the goals and objectives of the project; efficiency is 
achieving the goals and objectives in ways that deliver the desired 
level of quality for the least cost. Experienced project managers know 
that a balance exists between the two; that is, equilibrium exists 
between both. The most expensive and cheapest approaches are not 
necessarily the best ones and do not necessarily translate into suc-
cess. Project managers must seek to complete their project in a way 
that delivers the most value for the money expended.
•	 Standard: Focus on the greater good. Sometimes this goes beyond 
the project itself. A project is often part of a much bigger initiative or 
program of a company, especially large ones. Project managers must 
take a big picture perspective and then make a decision. Sometimes 

Project Management Code of Ethics  •  55
that perspective can put them at odds with some stakeholders on 
their project. Their perspective may even go beyond that of their 
company to consider the public’s interest. What may appear good for 
a project and the parent organization, such as a financial perspective, 
may actually hurt the life, safety, health, and overall welfare of the 
public. Under such scenarios, project managers will have to make a 
hard decision over which to choose. The right decision is to put the 
public welfare above all others, yet such decisions are often not easy 
to make.
•	 Standard: Keep the needs and wants of the customers at the fore-
front, whether confronted with black-and-white or gray issues. After 
all, customers are likely paying for project managers’ knowledge 
and services and for those of the entire project. If those interests are 
unclear or have changed, it is incumbent upon the project manager 
to work with other project managers to steer the project in the direc-
tion of meeting their requirements.
•	 Standard: Ensure that if partners or customers provide resources, 
such as products or designs, they have secured the right to use them 
in the development and delivery of a product or service. In other 
words, they should not use resources that do not belong to them 
unless given the expressed permission to do so. Using material with-
out permission from the owner is theft.
•	 Standard: Be willing to acknowledge if a mistake is made, and take 
the necessary action to correct it. For example, if a project manager 
made a mistake in employing resources, she should acknowledge 
it even in front of the customer, if necessary, and take appropriate 
action to resolve the problem. Such action will demonstrate that you 
take their investment in you and your project seriously and that 
you can be trusted to take corrective action whenever the circum-
stances involving the use of resources go awry.
Caring for project resources is not easy. These resources can take many 
forms. The tangible resources (e.g., equipment) are often easier to take care 
of because they can be tagged or essentially secured in a restricted area. 
Resources such as data and intellectual property are harder to keep track 
of and secure; once projects lose control of them it is harder, if not impos-
sible, to recover them.

56  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
3.3.5  Confidentiality
This one is closely allied with caretaking, except it is more involved with not 
revealing information entrusted to the project managers and members of 
their team. Project managers are quite often responsible for protecting and 
using data and personally identifiable information (PII) discreetly on their 
projects. For example, they may be building a strategic business system 
that contains critical information about the direction of a company. They 
may be working with a business partner who is sharing sensitive informa-
tion that cannot be released outside the purview of a project. Whatever the 
reason, managers have been entrusted with vital data and information that 
requires control. Failure to do so can result in severe consequences to the 
organization, the project, and the manager. Here are some general prin-
ciples concerning the confidentiality of information on a project:
•	 Standard: Do not use proprietary information for personal gain. A 
perfect example is insider trading, where a project manager uses 
highly proprietary information that will have an eventual impact on 
the value of stock; having such information will give the manager an 
unfair competitive advantage vis-à-vis other investors.
•	 Standard: Be judicious in handling sensitive data and informa-
tion. Project managers who possess restricted data or information 
that is not to be released are responsible for taking the necessary 
precautions to maintain that confidentiality. Failure to restrict 
access to that information represents carelessness and a breach 
of confidence.
•	 Standard: Establish controls to restrict access and release of sensitive 
information. Project managers are responsible for the overall perfor-
mance of their project. An important aspect, of course, is ensuring 
that the resources including sensitive data and information are man-
aged with the utmost care. Controls should be instituted to mini-
mize the probability and impact should they become compromised.
•	 Standard: Do not use sensitive data and information that should 
not have been revealed in the first place. If project managers receive 
data and information that could result in a legal violation, such 
as data and information that give the company an unfair competi-
tive advantage, appropriate action must be taken immediately. Using 
such data or information to win a contract imperils the project man-
ager and the organization legally.

3.3.6  Communication
This one is an important responsibility of a project manager. As mentioned 
earlier, project managers communicate 90 percent of their time with other 
stakeholders, whether vertically (i.e., up and down the chain of command) 
or horizontally (i.e., with peers). Ethically, some actions to take or avoid 
when communicating with stakeholders are:
•	 Standard: Present information objectively and truthfully. Project 
managers, if for no other reason than to establish and maintain 
credibility, should communicate in a way that people will rely on 
what they convey. In other words, they do not “massage” data and 
information to achieve some ulterior motive; their communications 
should be balanced, giving a true picture, for instance, about the state 
of a project. This means presenting data and information that may 
not look good for themselves or other key stakeholders on a project, 
which is not an easy thing to do and, not surprisingly, is rarely done. 
It takes considerable courage to present such messages.
•	 Standard: Don’t distort or alter facts and data. Seek and communi-
cate truthfully. Project managers need to tell all the important facts 
and data regarding a topic so that the right decision can be made by 
the right people. To do otherwise is risking credibility not just with 
the facts and data but with the individuals communicating them. 
Consequences, positive and negative, need to be communicated.
•	 Standard: Be direct without being blunt. Project managers should be 
willing to state what the fundamental issue is concerning a negative 
circumstance and not couch it with excuses, needless explanations, 
or blame toward someone or something. They should state what they 
think are the causes, triggers, and impacts and must be willing to 
deal with conflict in the same way; failure to be direct about a con-
flict only causes it to increase in intensity and makes it more compli-
cated to deal with later in the project life cycle.
•	 Standard: Establish and maintain an environment for open commu-
nications. Project managers should not allow, for example, group-
think or a shoot the messenger mentality to prevail. When open 
communications fail to exist, data and information get distorted, 
leading to erroneous decisions and actions by key stakeholders. An 
uninhibited atmosphere is critical to ensuring that open communi-
cations exist.

58  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
•	 Standard: Be willing to receive as well as to give criticism. This one 
is not easy because it requires an element of self-effacement and tol-
erance. However, receiving and delivering criticism allows project 
managers to grow and adapt effectively to the environment. The 
problem is often not the criticism but how it is delivered and received; 
taken from a positive perspective, it becomes a gift.
•	 Standard: Be an individual. Project managers need to communicate 
in a manner that does not require people to question whether there 
is a hidden motive behind what is being said. If people think or even 
perceive that the project managers are simply instruments for some-
one or are being influenced by some interested party, they will not 
trust what is being communicated and credibility will be lost.
3.3.7  Caring
Expressing a genuine concern for stakeholders on projects is an ethi-
cal responsibility of project managers. It centers on treating others with 
respect by recognizing their differences while at the same time getting 
them to work together to achieve a common goal. A stereotypical view of 
people is not only an outdated style of project management but also can 
cause ethical issues to arise. For example, people may begin treating oth-
ers in a way that does not respect their cultural or religious differences, 
resulting not only in poor performance but also in legal complications.
Project managers can demonstrate caring from an ethical standpoint in 
several ways:
•	 Standard: Embrace diversity. In today’s global environment, proj-
ects can involve several different cultures and countries, with people 
spanning many religions, races, and nationalities. However, diversity 
goes beyond these characteristics. It also involves embracing diver-
sity from a thinking standpoint. Increasingly, project managers and 
other stakeholders are recognizing that diversity also involves people 
viewing the world differently simply because of the way that they 
think using mental models. These models help people to make sense 
of the world, determining what data and information are important 
and what actions to take to respond to what they know. Project man-
agers, therefore, require good effective listening and empathy skills to 
motivate people to achieve the goals and objectives of their projects.

Project Management Code of Ethics  •  59
•	 Standard: Avoid embracing ethnocentrism—that is, the view that 
one culture is superior to that of other cultures or nationalities. In a 
world of globalization, of course, such an attitude is folly because it can 
prove divisive to project teams and alienate stakeholders. The opposite 
of ethnocentrism is polycentrism, recognizing that no one culture is 
superior to the other or that the world centers on just one.
•	 Standard: Don’t discriminate. Discrimination comes in many forms, 
not just race or sex. It can be due to mental models, for example. 
Some project managers like to surround themselves with people 
who think and behave like them. The danger is that when project 
managers find themselves surrounded by mirror images of them-
selves they might not recognize or admit that ethical dilemmas exist. 
Groupthink might take over, causing people to screen any indicators 
that an ethical issue or transgression exists.
•	 Standard: Provide opportunities for everyone, not just for a few. If 
they become selective, project managers find that they have encap-
sulated themselves with clones, so to speak, and provide most of the 
opportunities to them. The ones who are excluded (and are probably 
upset about it) may find ways to show vengeance by behaving in a 
way that could cause ethical dilemmas to arise. For example, they 
may exhibit behavior that violates the rights of colleagues or sabo-
tages the project in some way.
•	 Standard: Create and maintain a positive working environment. 
Thus, stakeholders will be more likely to identify or uncover ethical 
issues and violations without fear of reprisal. They will also be will-
ing to share ideas on how to address ethical issues and violations. 
To make such an environment a reality, project managers must 
adopt a view similar to Douglas McGregor’s Theory Y rather than 
Theory X. Project managers who subscribe to Theory Y view peo-
ple positively: self-motivated, enjoying working, and able to oper-
ate with minimal supervision. Project managers who subscribe to 
Theory X take a different view of people and see them as lazy, not to 
be trusted, and requiring close supervision. As you might suspect, 
people working under project managers adhering to Theory Y will 
be likely to disclose ethical issues and violations rather than try to 
cover them up.*

60  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
•	 Standard: Treat all people with respect. In other words, don’t act 
abusively by taking Theory X to the extreme. Demeaning individu-
als in front of team members, ignoring recognition when a person 
exceeds expectations, and deliberately not keeping certain individu-
als informed of specific information can become abusive if carried to 
the extreme, in which case it becomes harassment.
•	 Standard: Give credit to stakeholders who deserve it, and never per-
sonally take credit when it should be shared with others. If someone 
makes a significant contribution on the project team, project manag-
ers should ensure that the right individual gets the accolades. Failure 
to do so can build resentment and lead to one or more persons seek-
ing retaliation through unethical means simply to get even.
•	 Standard: Provide a safe environment, both physically and psycho-
logically. Physical safety means that people should be able to perform 
their tasks in an environment free from physical harm. Psychological 
safety means ensuring that people are treated with respect without 
fear of being harassed or ridiculed by other stakeholders. If some 
individuals feel that their physical or psychological safety is threat-
ened, they will do whatever they have to protect themselves, even if 
it means doing something unethical.
•	 Standard: Be willing to assist other team members when they need 
help. This action demonstrates care for others and for their success. 
When project managers help others to succeed, the favor is almost 
always returned. If, on the other hand, managers simply bark orders 
and offer no help for whatever reason, the team members may think 
their manager does not care and, in return, may do something 
unethical without caring what the consequences are.
•	 Standard: Be self-aware. Are the appropriate messages being sent 
to stakeholders, especially team members? Body language commu-
nicates attitude. Taken to the extreme, people on the receiving end 
may view a negative attitude as an excuse to do something unethical 
because the message being sent was one of “I don’t care.” If the proj-
ect manager does not care, after all, why should they?
•	 Standard: Listen. When working with stakeholders, apply active and 
effective listening. Not only does this action show that managers care, 
but, when dealing with an ethical issue or transgression, it helps them 
uncover its source and may even reveal ideas for how to deal with it. Not 
listening may result in overlooking key facts or data about an ethical 
situation and transgression or taking the wrong approach to resolve it.

Project Management Code of Ethics  •  61
When project managers demonstrate that they care about others on the 
team, it pays ethical rewards. It shows that team members are being taken 
seriously and are seen as valued members of the project and that their 
manager’s fate is tied directly to them. It increases the odds that people 
will take the high road.
3.3.8  Conduct
This one occurs on two levels—the project manager’s and others. 
Managers’ thoughts and behavior reveal much about their character; oth-
ers will feed off their thoughts and behavior, which can make a difference 
between doing what is right and what is wrong. The thoughts and actions 
of others can reveal much about them, too. It is important, therefore, that 
project managers’ thoughts and actions demonstrate taking the high road 
throughout the life of a project. Here are some important things to keep in 
mind regarding conduct:
•	 Standard: Be fair in all dealings. Project managers and every stake-
holder should be willing to listen to each other whenever an ethical 
dilemma arises. Coming to a conclusion before hearing all the facts 
and data can only hinder resolution since those involved may feel 
slighted in some way. The ethical dilemma can then escalate in vis-
ibility and magnitude.
•	 Standard: Be independent and objective by not accepting bribes, kick-
backs, or other illegal favors. While this might sound like common 
sense, the news reports of scandals in major corporations indicate 
such unethical behavior is prevalent at all levels of hierarchy.
•	 Standard: Don’t get into a situation in which there is an actual or 
perceived conflict of interest. If this happens, alert the proper people 
and seek guidance on altering the level and degree of involvement.
•	 Standard: Negotiate in good faith. Negotiation can occur internally 
with other functional managers or externally with vendors. Not 
negotiating in good faith should not be tolerated because people 
could end up feeling or being misled or misrepresented, causing 
suspicions to arise. People who feel that a project manager did not 
negotiate in good faith may retaliate by doing something unethical.
•	 Standard: Accept responsibility for decisions, actions, and results. 
Everyone on a project should accept ownership for their respec-
tive parts. Ownership makes good sense. People will feel more 

62  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
emotionally committed to achieve a positive result. Just as impor-
tantly, they will likely be more inclined not to engage in unethical 
behavior because they will want to be successful. Of course, they can 
take ownership to the extreme and conduct themselves unethically 
to complete a project successfully; naturally, such behavior should be 
discouraged. The end does not justify the means.
•	 Standard: Do not compromise ethics because of pressure. Sometimes 
the rewards of a project or the fear of penalty can lead some people to 
exhibit unethical conduct that they would not under ordinary circum-
stances. All stakeholders must guard against the tendency to succumb 
to pressure from someone with more power, as Stanley Milgram so 
aptly demonstrated. The Stanley Milgram experiment demonstrated 
that people have a desie to obey a person of authority, even when it 
meant violating their conscience. *
Conduct is closely interwoven with character. Individuals with strong 
character will likely not conduct themselves in an unethical manner. 
Yet sometimes without even realizing it they may find themselves doing 
just that. Time and circumstances can coalesce, which may contribute 
to a decision on an ethical dilemma and have unethical results.*
3.3.9  Commitment
Dedication is another word for commitment. People commit themselves 
to their projects. They want the project to succeed, which means they 
commit their time, energies, skills, and knowledge to achieve a successful 
outcome as defined by key stakeholders. Here are some ways to exhibit 
commitment to the success of a project:
•	 Standard: Walk the talk. Project managers should not only say they 
are committed to the project, but they should also demonstrate it 
through word and deed. That may mean fighting to resolve a seri-
ous issue despite the negative impact to them personally, working 
diligently to procure the resources that they promised, working long 
hours side by side with the team as they struggle to meet a major 
milestone even though it may be unnecessary, or taking the high

Business Press, 2008), 132-135. 

Project Management Code of Ethics  •  63
road even at potential expense to their career. If managers fail to 
walk the talk, some stakeholders will not take what the managers do 
or say seriously and could do something unethical as a result.
•	 Standard: Follow through on promises; otherwise, expectations will 
be dashed. Promising something that cannot be delivered can lead to 
frustration and anger, with which comes the potential for people 
to do something unethical in ways that can result in embarrass-
ment to the project manager, the project, and the organization.
•	 Standard: Set the tone. Project managers should let stakeholders know 
that they embrace the high road when managing the project. It is okay 
to ask if something is the right thing to do. So often during the course 
of a project people become so busy working that no one takes time to 
ask that simple question. For example, individual or group behavior 
becomes so intense that people may not even realize the ethical conse-
quences of their work. 
•	 Standard: Do not compete against the employer in a side business. 
No one can be expected to provide a service or product to a cus-
tomer if he or she is already providing that same one during full-
time employment—for example, providing the same service to an 
employer’s customer but at a cheaper price in an after-hours personal 
consulting business.
3.3.10  Compliance
All stakeholders need to follow the laws, regulations, policies, and proce-
dures that govern the project. Failure to comply can put a company, not 
just a project, at financial, legal, and reputational risk. What follows are 
some behaviors and actions to adhere to regarding compliance:
•	 Standard: Obey copyright, patent, and trademark laws. While some 
people and organizations may get away with violating them, others 
may get caught, and the penalties—from financial to reputational—
are severe. When in doubt, consult with legal professionals.
•	 Standard: Support disclosure when discovering noncompliance. 
Trying to hide the evidence can be just as damaging as the ethical 
violation itself. Many times noncompliance is due to ignorance or 
mistakes and less frequently to intent. Stakeholders should feel com-
fortable bringing up and openly discussing ethical or other issues 
resulting from noncompliance. If not, a problem exists.

64  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
•	 Standard: Apply laws, regulations, policies, and procedures consis-
tently and fairly. Being selective in their application can lead to claims 
of exhibiting favoritism and even discrimination. Everyone needs to 
comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, and procedures, 
and these same ones need to apply to everyone equally, except in 
extreme mitigating circumstances—and then under close scrutiny.
•	 Standard: Cooperate with investigators and auditors. If an ethical 
compliance issue is being investigated, project managers and all 
stakeholders need to cooperate fully. If a project manager holds back 
essential information, it is an ethical failure because she is condon-
ing the behavior and may even be construed as protecting individu-
als who were noncompliant. Even if an issue is not readily apparent, 
project managers should cooperate; failure to do so puts not only 
them but also other stakeholders and the overall organization or 
company at risk.
3.4  FINAL THOUGHTS
Codes of ethics are important to a profession, but they are meaningless 
if they are simply platitudes that no one follows. They can be viewed as 
something to strive for, but they are much more. They also provide guid-
ance on executing responsibilities and resolving ethical dilemmas. Failure 
to apply codes perhaps remains nothing more than a hope, even a dream.

The Ethical Trends and Challenges 
Confronting Project Managers
Before discussing some of the specific challenges that can cause stakehold-
ers on a project to face ethical dilemmas, this chapter addresses some of the 
trends that precipitate them. The potential ethical issues that these trends 
present can have considerable implications for projects, organizations, and 
individuals, so it is important to recognize them.
4.1  GLOBAL TRENDS
	
1.	Greater globalization: Over the last 30 to 40 years, international 
commerce has grown so dramatically that projects involving people 
from different cultures have become the norm rather than the excep-
tion. This has presented some challenges from an ethical perspective. 
Different customs, ways of doing business, laws, and governmental 
regulations have added to the already complex world of project 
management. Couple all that with language differences, politics, 
and history, and it is no surprise that the likelihood is high on these 
projects that stakeholders will face some sort of ethical situation 
or transgression.
	
2.	Importance of intellectual property (IP): Intellectual property is influ-
encing projects to a greater degree than ever before. With the growth 
in knowledge as a means of production comes the need to protect 
knowledge to acquire and maintain competitive advantage. This 
trend will increase with the corresponding growth in information 
technology (IT) as a key way to seize market advantage. In today’s 

70  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
work environment, projects involve many different disciplines in 
various industries, with each specialty playing a critical role in suc-
cess or failure. IP plays a crucial role in protecting the output of 
those specialties, which increases the chance of project managers 
ending up in ethical dilemmas due to the rise of a knowledge-based 
economy, the role of partnerships, and an increasingly competi-
tive environment.
	
3.	More rights in the workplace: Although the laws still lean in favor of 
the employer, employees are increasingly finding that their rights are 
becoming more important than ever. A web of laws and regulations 
from different governmental jurisdictions has afforded various legal 
protections of employees, ranging from using computing technol-
ogy to hiring practices for people of different ethnicities. These legal 
measures have permeated all aspects of business, including the proj-
ect environment. Projects managers and other key stakeholders now 
need greater awareness of these measures because whatever action 
they take in response to an ethical dilemmas can have legal implica-
tions for their company and themselves.
	
4.	Greater regulatory oversight: Government is increasingly regulating 
the affairs of business. The relationships among all the entities and 
systems have become more complex, with which comes the oppor-
tunity for something to go awry due to terrorism, corruption, or 
political instability. Governments, whether by choice or force, will 
get more and more involved in the affairs of businesses, especially 
on projects. For instance, many trade laws apply to projects that pre-
clude the export of information or technology to other countries. 
Other laws deal with the relations with certain categories of people. 
Project managers can easily find themselves in serious ethical situa-
tions and transgressions without realizing it and will end up facing 
fines and penalties not just for their companies but also for them-
selves, not to mention potential imprisonment and embarrassment.
	
5.	Outsourcing: This business practice in the business environment 
morphs from one form of business arrangement to another (e.g., co-
sourcing, near sourcing). Outsourcing has been increasing, and will 
continue to do so, as businesses seek ways to lower their costs and 
escape regulations. Outsourcing, of course, can occur both domes-
tically and internationally (e.g., offset agreements), and although 
it may raise revenues and avoid regulatory behavior, it also builds 

The Ethical Trends and Challenges Confronting Project Managers  •  71
resentment among individuals who have been and could possibil-
ity be victims of it. With this resentment comes the possibility of 
people committing ethical transgressions as a way to seek vengeance 
for what is perceived as an uncaring, disloyal institution toward 
them and can carry all the way through to the project level. Project 
stakeholders may not respect intellectual property rights, may fail to 
protect information, and may operate under the radar as a way to get 
back at their employer.
	
6.	Reliance on technology: It is no surprise that information technol-
ogy plays an important role in businesses today, at both the strategic 
and operational levels. With its rise have come greater demands for 
data and information to plan, execute, and monitor performance. 
Not only does this bring great rewards if employed effectively and 
efficiently, but it also leads to ethical situations and transgressions. 
Project stakeholders can use the technology to spy on individuals 
and organizations alike, to steal critical information, to discredit 
individuals and organizations, or to sabotage an organization’s 
infrastructure by introducing viruses.
4.2  ADAPTING TO GLOBAL TRENDS
These trends are increasingly putting pressure on project managers to 
deal with ethical challenges to an unprecedented degree. If they do not 
respond to them or do so in a way that increases the challenges, they 
will find themselves unable to manage their projects effectively. Here are 
nine major actions to consider when dealing with the challenges that the 
trends pose:
	
1.	Determine whether the challenge affects a strategic priority: Some 
project decisions and actions are more important than others. If 
project managers do not weigh the priority vis-à-vis ethical impor-
tance, they will be constantly dealing with ethical dilemmas and 
never manage their project. A priority that is strategic in nature 
might be a decision or action that affects the achievement of a major 
goal or objective of a project. Some ethical dilemmas may transcend 
strategic priority, such as racial discrimination or embezzlement. 

72  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
But short of these, project managers need to determine if a strategic 
priority outweighs the importance of an ethical dilemma. 
	
2.	Review due diligence: Project managers determine the necessary dis-
ciplines, e.g., policies, procedures, processes, tools, and techniques 
related to ethics that should be in place for their project to deal with 
an ethical situation or transgression. They and the other stakehold-
ers should also determine if sufficient breadth and depth exist to have 
prevented an ethical situation and transgression and, if so, whether 
they were adequate enough.
	
3.	Review due care: A project can have all the disciplines in place and 
still not apply them during a project’s execution. Occasionally, an 
ethical situation or transgression exists because of deliberate or 
benign neglect of disciplines. In other words, little or no effort is 
made to apply them in the project environment. It is similar to build-
ing a schedule and then not following it; it is merely window dress-
ing. The same circumstance can apply to ethical disciplines; they 
merely exist as a lip service or to placate the auditors. The key is for 
project managers to link due diligence and due care in their review 
of an ethical situation or transgression to ensure follow-through.
	
4.	Look for compliance: The focus of compliance is very narrow and 
legally oriented. Project managers and other key stakeholders should 
review ethical dilemmas to see whether certain laws apply and, if they 
do, whether all pertinent laws are being complied with. Not every 
ethical dilemma involves violating laws; that determination needs to 
be made. If a law has been violated, the right stakeholders need to be 
involved to ensure that corrective action occurs to mitigate or avoid 
fines, penalties, and perhaps even imprisonment.
	
5.	Take a trustee perspective: Project managers need to take the per-
spective that they are trustees, or agents, for their company. While 
they may not be a formal manager in the organization, their orga-
nization has put resources under their care to deliver a project or 
service in a way that upholds that trust. This involves ensuring not 
only that the resources are applied efficiently and effectively but also 
in a manner that is done ethically. Project managers can commit an 
act that breaches trust, e.g., not reporting project status honestly.
	
6.	Confront ethical dilemmas: When an ethical dilemma arises, it is 
best to confront it. That is, the project manager should take it head 
on and not hope that it will go away or that no one will say anything. 
The reality is that often, like all problems, ethical dilemmas not dealt 

The Ethical Trends and Challenges Confronting Project Managers  •  73
with early on will only continue to worsen and erupt at the wrong 
time. Failure to act endangers not only the organization but also the 
people involved. Project managers need to determine up front the 
who, what, when, where, why, and how of an ethical dilemma to pre-
vent it from getting out of control.
	
7.	Maintain credibility: When dealing with an ethical dilemma, project 
managers need to take the high road. They cannot appear biased or 
pursuing hidden motives. They need to act in an honest, straightfor-
ward manner. If at any time project managers appear to lose their 
objectivity, independence, and integrity when dealing with an ethi-
cal dilemma, stakeholders will start to question their motives. If that 
should occur, and it can happen quite easily and unknowingly, then 
they will need to seek outside help to deal with the situation.
	
8.	Implement corrective action: Project managers will need to take cor-
rective action to resolve an ethical dilemma; simply being aware is 
not enough. They need to get with the affected stakeholders—if no 
legal requirements preclude them from doing so—and come up with 
a plan to address the ethical dilemma. An appropriate approach is 
to apply the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle (Figure 4.1), which provides a 
structure for dealing with and resolving ethical concerns. Of course, 
if the ethical dilemma is being handled by outside parties, then proj-
ect managers can do nothing but observe.
	
9.	Ensure congruence between beliefs and behavior: Project managers 
need to ensure that they walk the talk, meaning that their beliefs 
about ethics are manifested through their behavior. They can-
not hold people to standards that they do not follow themselves. 
It is poor project management and poor leadership. If people see

hypocrisy, they will not follow project managers’ guidance and 
will likely not participate willingly in resolving ethical situations 
and transgressions.
4.3  STRAYING FROM THE HIGH ROAD
Project managers constantly face pressures and challenges that test their 
ethical resiliency, often with limited or no authority, and yet are expected 
to deliver results that satisfy some powerful stakeholders. Fortunately, 
most project managers take the high road by dealing with ethical dilem-
mas in the appropriate way; the key question is why do some take an inap-
propriate route?
4.3.1  Organizational Perversities or Dysfunctions
The working environment is replete with confusion, wasted effort, and 
fear. One cause is typically poor allocation of resources, making it diffi-
cult to plan and causing a focus on outmaneuvering competition for those 
resources rather than achieving goals and objectives. A second cause is the 
misalignment of projects with the strategies of the organization at large, 
resulting in a project supporting priorities that lack justification and that 
could receive the axe at any time. The third cause is incompetence among 
senior leadership, which involves shifting organizational changes, the 
inability to focus, and little or no oversight over performance.
As you might suspect, this environment is ripe for ethical dilemmas fac-
ing project managers. To survive, project managers, not knowing whom 
to trust and having no idea whether the project matters to the right peo-
ple, encourage negative politics. Their emphasis becomes one of seeking 
acceptance or justification rather than achieving the goals and objectives 
of their project, let alone their projects. Project managers, team members, 
and other stakeholders may end up with projects that lack efficacy, mean-
ing that they have no influence on their direction or execution. Added 
to this is a lack of veracity because no one can believe in anything any-
one has said or promised; a real credibility gap exists and starts to widen 
as each day passes. A lapse in collaboration occurs inside and outside of 
the project because no one can count on anyone being held accountable 
or responsible.

The Ethical Trends and Challenges Confronting Project Managers  •  75
Naturally, project managers and other stakeholders feel that they may 
need to override ethical considerations to survive. Some examples include 
project managers exaggerating requests for resources, massaging reports 
in such as a way that masks the truth, falsifying reports to survive budget 
cuts or to outmaneuver other projects, and not making a decision for fear 
of getting in trouble.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Generate reports that contain reliable facts and data, meaning that 
the contents are verified several times for reliability and validity.
•	 Have key stakeholders review reports and approve them.
•	 Confront issues early on despite their unpopularity.
4.3.2  Tone at the Top
Members of senior leadership set the tone that permeates the entire fabric 
of an organization. When the tone is negative or uncaring, the rest of the 
organization, down to the project level, will likely be affected. The focus 
here is uncaring.
An uncaring management manifests itself in several ways. First, it is 
nonengaged in the daily operations of the organization, and this atti-
tude carries all the way down to the project and even subproject levels. 
Second, accountability and responsibility are practically nonexistent; no 
one assumes ownership of results and sometimes even when the results 
are positive because, ultimately, no one cares. Third, key decisions are 
delayed or never made; senior managers have “higher priorities” over 
what is happening below their levels. Finally, changing leadership 
occurs, resulting in a lack of stability that, in turn, causes lack of priori-
tizing and direction.
This environment paves the way for ethical dilemmas to arise. People 
in general lose interest in what they are doing. Their focus becomes more 
on protecting and advancing themselves than on achieving the goals and 
objectives on their project. Some people may find it as an opportunity to 
pursue interests at the expense of the project, such as a second job. Other 
people may feel that whatever they do does not matter and thereby exhibit 
a lack of interest in the project.
Projects managers can find dealing with ethical dilemmas under these 
circumstances difficult when members of management are negative and 
micromanaging the project. Project managers may carelessly prepare 

76  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
reports that contain incorrect or skewed information. They may not 
bother to implement effective project governance disciplines because none 
of it appears to have any value. They can also be nonchalant toward team 
members who stretch the limits of ethical boundaries while on the job.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Keep key stakeholders engaged by sending reports and other docu-
ments on a regular basis to encourage and maintain involvement.
•	 Invite key stakeholders to attend key meetings, including ones at the 
project level.
•	 Implement good governance procedures, tools, and techniques for 
the project which require the involvement of key stakeholders.
•	 Meet regularly with key stakeholders to keep them informed and to 
obtain feedback on how to improve or maintain project performance.
4.3.3  Pressure to Report Only Positive Data
The pressure to report only positive information is immense, especially 
when money is involved. It can happen so that companies can raise 
stock prices or, in the project environment, when stakes are high on a 
project’s outcome.
This pressure can be caused by many things. First, people are often 
rewarded for providing “good” information and not rewarded for provid-
ing “bad” information, which may reveal a less than desirable result and 
may provide an opportunity for someone to deny the messenger a bonus. 
Second, the organizational hierarchy may be so traditional or unyielding 
that to report anything other than positive is career suicide. Finally, the 
pressure to achieve certain results, such as a metric, may be so strong that 
people feel compelled to distort a message or cover up results to avoid 
retribution by those with a vested interest in achieving a specific result.
This environment creates the potential for ethical situations and trans-
gressions in several ways. It causes people to cover up mistakes in an effort 
to look good. It fosters an atmosphere of fear in which numbers are mas-
saged to avoid punishment. It encourages people to blame other people for 
negative or less than expected results.
Project managers can find themselves in an ethical bind. To avoid deal-
ing with the truth, they begin to play games with the facts and data. They 
may, for instance, do watermelon reporting, which involves giving the 
impression that everything is going according to plans, but if someone 

The Ethical Trends and Challenges Confronting Project Managers  •  77
digs deeper that is not really the case. Project managers may not use tools 
or techniques for fear their use may reveal less than desirable perfor-
mance. For example, a project manager may elect to manage with a mile-
stone schedule at a very high level to cover up significant slides rather than 
use techniques like earned value.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Ensure that whatever data and information are available for reports 
are reliable and valid, meaning scrubbing and cleansing the data 
prior to inclusion.
•	 Be consistent and persistent in reporting, meaning that the reports 
do not make exceptions to content and that they are developed and 
distributed on a regular basis.
•	 Have key stakeholders, such as the customer and the sponsor, review 
the reports prior to their release, not only to verify the data and infor-
mation but also to generate support for the reports, good or bad.
4.3.4  Faster Results
Getting products to market faster than the competitor can make the dif-
ference between being the leading company in a market and being the 
second or even just a participant. Speed seems to be the addiction for 
just about everything. The project environment is no different; achieving 
results faster seems to be the norm. For example, several years ago a 3-year 
project was considered quite normal in the information technology envi-
ronment. Today, few projects are allowed to last longer than 6 months and 
rarely more than 18 months.
There are several causes for this circumstance, one already mentioned: 
pressure to beat competition in the market place. A second cause is the 
pressure on senior management to achieve results quickly. When proj-
ects are the centerpiece for achieving those results, the pressure can be 
immense. Sarbanes-Oxley is a perfect example, where firms rushed to 
achieve satisfactory results in a relatively short period of time; otherwise, 
the stock value of a company could plummet and the careers of certain 
executives could face a similar fate.
This environment could lead to ethical dilemmas. The pressure to speed 
can cause burnout, putting undue pressure on certain individuals as opposed 
to others. If the Pareto rule applies, 80 percent sit around as they watch 
the other 20 percent operate at an unrelenting pace to meet an aggressive 

78  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
deadline, often sharing in the same rewards as those who worked the fast-
est and hardest. Other individuals make mistakes and do not bother to fix 
them, knowing that an unrealistic schedule takes precedence over quality; 
someone else may have to deal with the problems, for example, sometimes 
customers who received a product that they thought met their needs.
Project managers can find themselves taking a different route than the 
high road to deliver faster results. To deliver results faster, they may find 
they have no other choice but to circumvent standards or requirements to 
deliver a flawed product or service to meet a date, hoping either that no 
one discovers it or that they can pass it off later in the product life cycle. 
Taking advantage of the Pareto rule, they may put pressure on a select 
group of individuals and then forget about their contribution to the proj-
ect and claim all the credit.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Institute project management disciplines, tools, and techniques in a 
manner that is scaled to the needs of the project, and insist that the 
team follows them.
•	 Include quality in the processes for building the final deliverable 
rather than have people pump output that results only in rework.
•	 Develop alternatives and a recommendation based on options analysis 
to determine the most efficient and effective way to complete a project.
4.3.5  No Trade-Offs between Efficiency and Effectiveness
Members of management see no relationship between cost and schedule. 
Both are considered important. This places extreme pressure on the proj-
ect manager and the team.
There are several causes to this scenario. First, senior manage-
ment faces both cost and schedule pressures, which in turn permeate 
all other activities. The second cause is that senior managers may be 
unrealistic in their demands; in other words, they are in denial by not 
realizing that the business world is often a series of trade-offs among 
assets; rarely are cost, schedule, and quality balanced. One often yields 
to the achievement of one or two of the others. The third cause is that 
senior managers commit unrealistically to a set of goals and objectives 
to placate higher management or the shareholders and then pressure 
the remainder of the organization to make it happen without the cor-
responding level of support.

The Ethical Trends and Challenges Confronting Project Managers  •  79
The environment naturally lends itself to ethical situations and trans-
gressions. The pressure is immense to deliver and encourages stakeholders 
to cut corners to save time and money. Everyone scrambles about almost 
erratically to accomplish something without concern for anything else but 
cost and schedule.
Project managers can find themselves in a difficult ethical situation. 
They may succumb to pressure to accept an unrealistic plan, both in terms 
of cost and schedule. They may find themselves knowingly allowing poor 
quality of work to exist in the hope of meeting unrealistic targets. They 
may not bother to put project management techniques and disciplines into 
place; if they do, they may not have the breadth and depth to do the job.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Come back with an options analysis and recommendation on a realis-
tic approach toward a project; by doing so, stakeholders will then know 
what the risks are and share in the responsibility if the project fails.
•	 Generate and distribute reports on a consistent basis to provide vis-
ibility of the cost and schedule slides so that key stakeholders see the 
impacts of their unrealistic demands.
4.3.6  Transglobal Operations
In today’s environment, businesses work on an international scale incon-
ceivable just 50 years ago. This growth in international business has led 
to a wave of global projects that go beyond, for instance, the oil and gas 
industry. IT, manufacturing, and pharmaceutical projects are other exam-
ples where projects cross international boundaries.
There are several causes for this circumstance to arise. One is the growth 
of international capital, originating not just from the United States but 
also in other financial centers of the world. Another reason is the rise of 
communications and transportation to transcend time and distance. Still 
another reason is the decline of communism and the embrace of the capi-
talist ideology. The causes are countless.
These transglobal operations provide, without much effort, opportuni-
ties for ethical dilemmas on a project. Stakeholders may find themselves 
lacking the diverse background of working with other cultures, thereby 
embracing ethnocentrism, which can result in mistreating and disre-
specting the beliefs and values of others. It can lead to engaging in busi-
ness practices that may not be acceptable to the home office. It can lead to 

80  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
ignoring customs of other cultures, such as holy days for certain religions, 
thereby aggravating relationships.
Project managers can end up in difficult ethical circumstances in a trans-
global environment. To meet cost and schedule targets, they may engage 
in business practices that may violate their country’s laws and regulations. 
They may disrespect other people’s cultural beliefs and values to meet those 
same targets. They may have to take actions that are less than ethical, but 
not illegal, to accommodate costs impacted by factors not in their control 
(e.g., currency fluctuations). They may be asked to act in a way that violates 
local customs and laws. They may also perform corporate espionage on 
partners for a transglobal project.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Become more sensitive to different cultures, such as by attending 
diversity training and having others do the same.
•	 Factor in cultural differences in their plans, such as accounting for 
different perceptions of time.
•	 Become more sensitive to home and other country legal require-
ments related to projects.
4.3.7  Diffusion of Accountability and Authority
Despite the rise of large organizations, particularly in the marketplace, 
many of them operate in a decentralized manner, making it difficult to 
describe accountability and authority in a sufficient manner. As a result, 
coordination, collaboration, and communication can be difficult, espe-
cially at the project level.
Several causes are attributed to this circumstance. First, the largeness 
of institutions makes it difficult to manage operations and activities down 
to the lowest level; sheer size necessitates delegation and decentralization. 
Second, the rise of large international corporations requires that they 
be flexible in how they conduct business, and a decentralized structure 
enables that to happen. They can adapt to changing conditions, too, for 
example, by buying and purchasing other entities.
This diffusion of accountability and authority, of course, is a double-
edged sword. It provides an environment whereby some people feel that 
they can act, for example, as an agent on behalf of the organization when 
they do not have that right to do so. Without adequate oversight, they can 

The Ethical Trends and Challenges Confronting Project Managers  •  81
involve themselves in less than ethical activities with the hope of never 
being discovered.
Project managers can find themselves in ethical dilemmas, too, but 
often as victims. It may be difficult to track the performance of others on 
their project, especially if they work on the other side of the planet. It also 
may be close to impossible to track a single contact point to resolve an 
issue because the team is so globally widespread. The same can be said for 
finding the right stakeholders to make key decisions. Above all, they may 
find it difficult to hold anyone on the team responsible to achieve specific 
results because the functions or processes to complete even a simple deliv-
erable are dispersed.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Define roles, responsibilities, and authorities up front, and build 
definitive responsibility assignment matrices.
•	 Create an organizational structure that is reflected in an organiza-
tion chart.
•	 Assign one person responsible for reporting progress for activities 
involving multiple resources.
•	 Ensure that visibility of responsibilities occurs and continues by 
reviewing them at the start of project meetings.
4.3.8  Obedience to Authority
This may be a contradiction to the previous challenge, but it remains an 
issue. In traditional organizations, especially stovepipe ones adhering to 
Theory X, perception about people and authority of executives and senior 
managers can be so strong that the project manager is simply a figurehead 
for a project. Instead, most of the decision making and execution of the 
project are done by the sponsor or members of a steering team.
There are several causes for this obedience to authority. First, people may 
prefer it because it acts as a convenient way to upwardly delegate respon-
sibility, especially if something goes wrong. Second, individuals who have 
power very rarely want to relinquish it. In addition, senior management 
and executives do not trust the rank-and-file employees, who include proj-
ect managers. They will likely construe taking charge as micromanaging.
The consequences of this are many. First, as mentioned already, peo-
ple will upwardly delegate by shrugging off any sense of responsibility. 

82  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
Second, some people will prefer to operate under the radar for fear of retri-
bution should they think outside the box or take a chance. Third, it causes 
people to hoard information rather than share it. Fourth, few people are 
willing to take responsibility for their actions and instead blame others to 
protect themselves.
Project managers can find themselves in an ethical bind. They may 
be reluctant to raise ethical concerns for fear that they, too, will be held 
responsible for any transgression. They may be reluctant to make any deci-
sions until they receive direction from senior management. They may find 
themselves constantly painting a rosy picture when the facts and data tell 
a different story. Or they may rarely take responsibility for negative results 
but instead may blame other people or organizations for circumstances.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Generate reports that contain irrefutable evidence about the status 
of a project.
•	 Perform a risk analysis of any commanded decisions, and commu-
nicate that risk to the appropriate stakeholders, thereby having them 
share in the responsibility of the results.
•	 Bring in other experts who may provide a different insight to the 
project, countering the impact of powerful stakeholders.
4.3.9  Overemphasis on Legal Compliance
Compliance is just one slice of the continuum called ethics, albeit an 
important one. It is important because of the ramifications for violating 
laws and regulations. Failure to comply can mean fines, misdemeanor 
or felony charges, jail sentences, disbarment, even damage to reputation. 
However, when compliance gets the brunt of the attention at the expense 
of other ethical concerns, then the nonlegal concerns can surface and 
cause just as much harm to an organization or project.
Fines and penalties are just one cause for overemphasis on compliance. 
Just as important, especially for government contractors, is disbarment 
from future contracts with governmental organizations. In other words, it 
can involve a loss of future revenue. There is another cause, too. This type 
of ethical dilemma is more tangible than most others. It is easier to detect 
than others, like harassment or soiling a person’s reputation or deliberate 
lack of productivity to sabotage a project. In soft ethics cases, often the 
victim leaves or removes himself from the circumstance.

The Ethical Trends and Challenges Confronting Project Managers  •  83
The consequences of this circumstance are that people will focus on the 
more immediate, tangible ethical situations or transgressions because they 
will be impacted in some measurable way. Another consequence is that 
some participants on the project will focus more on covering themselves 
than getting the work done for fear of being fined or going to prison. One 
additional consequence is that people will simply go through the motions 
of compliance without really appreciating the value of the law or regula-
tion. In other words, the goal is to get the government off their backs.
Project managers can find themselves crossing the boundaries of ethi-
cal behavior in several ways. They may intentionally overlook soft ethi-
cal concerns and concentrate solely on the ones with legal ramifications. 
They know that a fine or prison sentence often speaks louder than a slap 
on the hand for allowing a minor ethical transgression. They may sim-
ply go through the motions to satisfy the government and make manage-
ment happy, yet they truly do not invest much time and effort to inculcate 
behaviors and values that will prevent violation of the law. Ethics training 
in many large companies is treated as simply the “flavor of the month” 
program. Not surprising, even after receiving training, an ethical viola-
tion occurs, attesting to the ineffectiveness of the training.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Look at the larger picture of an ethical situation or transgression—
that is, at areas that go beyond the legal arena.
•	 Raise these larger issues at project meetings not only to identify 
impacts but also to encourage people’s sensitivity of ethical situa-
tions and transgressions from a much broader perspective.
•	 Bring in outside experts who will not only look at the legal consid-
erations but also at others (e.g., cost and schedule performance, cus-
tomer relationships).
4.3.10  Conflicting Laws and Regulations
Companies within and outside of the United States face this challenge. 
Within the United States, the laws often conflict from state to state. Outside 
the United States, the laws among countries also conflict. What is permis-
sible in the way of doing business in one country, for example, may not be 
the same in another. In recent years, this challenge has intensified, making 
ethical decision making difficult.

84  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
There are several causes for this challenge. First, a greater fragmenta-
tion of the international community has occurred with the collapse of the 
Soviet Union. Second, more countries are instituting greater governmental 
involvement in economic affairs. Third, the laws and regulations of these 
countries often change when new political leadership comes into power.
The consequences of this circumstance are that individuals find it dif-
ficult to maintain a contemporary knowledge of all the laws and regula-
tions. They also find that they are in frequent violation of some law in one 
country while compliant in another. They can also find themselves so busy 
trying to comply with the law that they lose time that could have been 
spent performing the real work of the project.
Project managers can end up in ethical dilemmas without ever realizing 
it. They may find that they have to comply with laws that seem unreason-
able from a project perspective, meaning that the legalities actually jeop-
ardize cost and schedule performance. Facing such pressures, they may 
circumvent the laws under extreme pressure from their senior manage-
ment. They also may discover that procurement efforts are impeded by 
laws and thus may take shortcuts in the process that could eventually get 
them in trouble.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Contact the legal or ethics departments whenever a question arises 
about interpreting or clarifying a law.
•	 Access historical data and lessons learned from previous projects on 
how similar issues were handled in the past.
•	 Avoid becoming a “latrine lawyer” by acting like an expert on the 
law; when in doubt, check with the legal department.
•	 Become knowledgeable about the organization’s policies and proce-
dures in regards to dealing with other governments and laws; in fact, 
the entire team should become knowledgeable, too.
4.3.11  Conflict of Interest and Conflicting Interest
Increasingly, the issue of conflict of interest and conflicting interest has 
received more visibility in recent years. Conflict of interest occurs when 
individuals in a position within an organization must make or carry out 
decisions while potentially or actually impairing their independence and 
objectivity. Conflicting interest occur when personal activities interfere 

The Ethical Trends and Challenges Confronting Project Managers  •  85
with their responsibilities on another job, resulting in diluting their degree 
of dedication and commitment.
Conflict of interest is of concern nowadays because legal requirements 
play an increasingly important role due to greater shareholder involve-
ment in governance, such as required under Sarbanes-Oxley. Second, 
the relationship of government and business has gotten more inter-
twined over the last several decades, drawing more attention to areas 
like procurement management where even the mere appearance of a 
conflict of interest can be problematic.
Awareness of conflicting interest has risen as well, mainly because in the 
current economic climate workforce job security has declined; thus, more 
and more people are getting side jobs to sustain their lifestyles in case they 
lose their main job. Sometimes, these side jobs can become so lucrative 
that employees cannot fulfill their responsibilities.
In this environment, project managers can face ethical dilemmas. From a 
conflict of interest perspective, they may find that their previous experience 
with an employer or investments may set the stage for them to lose their 
objectivity and independence when making decisions or carrying out the 
plans of the project. They may inadvertently make a decision that violates 
a law or company policy. From a conflicting interest perspective, they may 
have side consulting businesses that could draw their attention away from 
fulfilling their responsibilities as a project manager.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Become more knowledgeable about the pertinent laws, regulations, 
policies, and procedures related to conflicts of interest and conflict-
ing interests, especially when it comes to government contracts.
•	 Encourage the participation of the procurement organization on 
projects to oversee compliance with the laws, regulations, policies, 
and procedures related to conflicts of interest.
•	 Have ethics on the agenda for ongoing team meetings.
4.3.12  Pressure to Adjust Results to Meet Expectations
Sometimes, perhaps oftentimes, executives and senior management make 
commitments that set expectations so high that it puts tremendous pres-
sure on the people doing the work to meet them. These expectations can be 
so unrealistic that when reality hits home people are fearful of reporting 

86  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
the truth. This is a prescription for failure for project managers, who are 
afterward found in an indefensible position.
There are many causes for this circumstance. One is top-down manage-
ment style, which fails to ask people first what is required to get the job done. 
Second, key stakeholders may have rose-colored glasses that filter any data 
and information that refute their decisions. Third, incentive programs for 
executive and managers can put tremendous pressure on them to achieve 
near impossible results, which in turn puts pressure on the project manager 
to do the same. Finally, senior and executive management may be involved 
in groupthink, which puts considerable pressure on people to distort reality.
When faced with this challenge, people act in ways that cannot help but 
lead to disaster. They begin to cut corners. They are so fearful of failure 
that they play it safe by doing only what they have been directed to do. 
They may not be truthful about their progress.
Project managers can find themselves in an ethical situation. They may 
experience pressure to report only positive results or to manipulate data. 
They may try to shift responsibility for not meeting expectations by point-
ing fingers at team members.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Design and deploy a project information repository that is populated 
with reliable data, meaning that its contents enable the generation 
of useful reports on the status of their projects. Good data become 
irrefutable, no matter the pressure. As Alan Mullaly, head of Ford, 
said, “The data will set you free.”
•	 Generate a consistent set of reports that people can use to track per-
formance over time, making it difficult for one or a few stakeholders 
to sway their contents.
•	 Make results visible as often as possible, such as through a project 
web site or a portal.
•	 Go to the legal department or call a company hotline to report any 
pressure to have reports altered.
4.3.13  Restricted Access to Information
While at first this might not seem like an ethical dilemma, it can be one if 
the intent is to mislead. Sometimes people are denied information because 
of the sensitivity or controversial nature of the content.

The Ethical Trends and Challenges Confronting Project Managers  •  87
There are several reasons for this challenge. First, management may 
restrict access to information because if people know in advance that the 
budget for the project is going to be reduced, perhaps because it no lon-
ger supports the strategic goals and objectives of the higher organization, 
they may no longer concentrate on their work and may focus on find-
ing another job. Second, executive and senior management may want to 
protect intellectual property or proprietary information, especially if the 
project could lead to a significant competitive advantage.
There are consequences, of course, to restricting access to information. 
Stakeholders, especially the ones doing the work, may feel resentful about 
not being trusted to have information. Some stakeholders may not be able 
to communicate or collaborate effectively.
Project managers may find themselves in an ethical bind. They may 
know information that could negatively affect the financial well-being of 
team members yet may not be at liberty to share critical information about 
what could impact them. They could generate reports that tell only part of 
a story, potentially misleading people as to the project’s and consequently 
team members’ fate. Under such circumstances, the project manager is 
placed in an unenviable position of having a responsibility to the team and 
maintaining the trust and confidence of senior or executive management.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Take inventory of data and information and determine which need 
to be protected and which do not; content of the latter will require 
controlled access.
•	 Determine controlled access, which will help to preclude the release 
of intellectual property and other proprietary information to the 
wrong individuals or organizations.
•	 Take actions to ensure open dialogue and sharing of information on 
the project during meetings, and post information on a web site or 
some other medium. The key is to determine what can be shared and 
what requires restrictive access.
4.3.14  Reduced Cycle Time
Reinventing the wheel, whether in the office or a manufacturing facility, 
is a waste of time and energy. It is best if a project can capitalize on the 
work of previous projects to accomplish expeditious goals and objectives. 

88  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
However, sometimes pressure to reduce cycle time comes from upper 
management, which can lead to ethical dilemmas.
There are many reasons for this challenge. First, tremendous cost pres-
sures may lead people to falsely believe that faster equals cheaper. Second, it 
is considered good practice to not reinvent the wheel because doing so only 
lengthens the cycle time to complete work. Third, the desire to deliver a prod-
uct or service ahead of the competition can inadvertently or unintentionally 
introduce errors or defects.
When cycle time is reduced, sometimes corners are cut to deliver a prod-
uct or service, thus circumventing quality standards. For example, team 
members may deliberately release a product offering features or functions 
the customer wants, but doing so may result in considerable problems 
rework later, such as during sustaining and maintenance.
Project managers can find themselves in an ethical complication. They 
may allow the team to circumvent standards of quality to satisfy the need 
to reduce cycle time. They may reuse material to which another company 
owns the patent rights or copyrights to cut down on cycle time.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Document project processes, such as management plans, and ensure 
that people use and follow them during projects.
•	 Streamline processes.
•	 Build quality in processes to ensure that there is less emphasis on 
inspection.
•	 Institute controls (e.g., thresholds, metrics) to trigger when reviews 
are necessary.
•	 Implement cross-checking of people’s work, keeping in mind that this 
may add to the cycle time. Therefore, these cross-checks should occur 
only for key elements of the product or service being delivered.
4.3.15  Increased Customer Satisfaction
Like reducing cycle time, this one seems innocent. Yet, like reducing cycle 
time, it can lead to ethical dilemmas in an effort to please the customer.
There are several causes for this challenge. First, because of international 
competition, first from Japan and now from China and India, the competi-
tion for customer satisfaction now plays an instrumental role in winning and 

The Ethical Trends and Challenges Confronting Project Managers  •  89
sustaining business. Second, business retention in a changing world actually 
stabilizes revenue generation and allows for concentrating on expanding 
market presence. Third, customer satisfaction is good public relations.
Sometimes, increasing customer satisfaction encourages people to act 
in a way that might be construed as an ethical situation or transgression. 
Team members may cave in to an unrealistic or faulty request that could 
eventually lead to a defective product, thereby putting the project and cus-
tomer at risk. Team members may hide potentially negative information 
that the customer should know about for fear of alienating the customer.
Project managers may be under even more pressure to satisfy the cus-
tomer. They may find that their management uses metrics to gauge customer 
satisfaction; good results in metrics may bring positive rewards, thereby 
encouraging positive reporting rather than negative reporting. To please 
the customer, project managers may overlook customer requests to expand 
the product or service without assessing the impact to cost and schedule; 
however, in the long run this can escalate costs. They may also not want 
to confront a sensitive issue or problem for fear of upsetting the customer; 
instead they allow the problem to continue in the hope that it fades away 
but, in reality, often never does but instead gets more intense.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Implement good project management disciplines that encourage the 
involvement of the customer; one specific discipline is integrated 
change control, which, if implemented correctly, will require an 
impact analysis of any significant change requests.
•	 Engage other key stakeholders who, not being with the customer 
(e.g., the project sponsor), can provide a check on a customer who 
makes unrealistic requests.
•	 Provide visibility for customer requests, such as posting on a web site, so 
that other stakeholders can review them and make recommendations.
4.3.16  Stress on Becoming a Team Player
For projects to succeed, everyone needs to be a team player, that is, some-
one who can communicate and collaborate with one another to achieve 
a common vision. Without team players, a project is nothing more than 
a group of people who operate independently and direct their energies and 
efforts toward their own goals and not necessarily those of the project. In 

90  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
most project environments in the corporate environment, the pressure to 
be a team player is immense, and to be labeled as not a team player, espe-
cially for the project manager, can prove costly from a career perspective.
There are two principal reasons for the trend toward being a team player. 
First, the project environment has become very specialized; any final prod-
uct, such as an engineering or software project, often requires contributions 
from and cooperation of people from different disciplines. Second, the work 
environment, partly due to the downturn in the economy and the threat of 
outsourcing, has placed immense pressure on people to work more coopera-
tively and closely than ever before; the inability to work with others can lead to 
being identified as not a team player and, subsequently, a target for dismissal.
The pressure to be a team player can affect stakeholders’ ethical behavior 
on a project. They may submerge their thoughts to avoid appearing too 
independent from the rest of the team. For example, they may disagree 
with the direction of the project for valid reasons but will not speak their 
concerns for fear of being ostracized. They may be reluctant to offer new 
ideas for fear of upsetting the status quo. Basically, some stakeholders will 
surrender their independent thoughts due to groupthink. In the end, for 
fear of not appearing as a team player, their communications and creativ-
ity suffer and could lead to rework.
Project managers may be susceptible to this pressure. They may feel 
compelled to hold back their own opinions. They may be reluctant to 
bring up an issue that they feel could negatively impact their relationship 
with the team even though they know that if they raised the issue it would 
improve the chances for project success. Some project managers may even 
suppress serious negative information to maintain at least the perception 
that everyone on the project team is a team player. They may even allow 
unethical situations and transgressions to take place so that they and oth-
ers appear as team players.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Encourage team members and other stakeholders to participate in 
exercises such as brainstorming that require thinking outside the box.
•	 Bring in experts who provide a contrary perspective to current 
thoughts about a challenge, issue, or concern.
•	 Assign people to activities that encourage them to perform indepen-
dently, thereby reducing the influence of peer pressure.

4.3.17  Play by the Book
Otherwise known as doing things right, this offers several advantages. 
It helps keep people out of trouble. It allows for people to march in the 
same direction. It reduces waste. Doing the right things can vary from 
doing things right. People comply with the rules, yet unethical behavior 
can still arise.
Project managers may hide behind the rules as an excuse. They may feel 
that the rules allow them to condone a particular behavior on their part or 
that of others. They may bend the rules to act in a questionable way. 
Some examples include allowing some activity to occur that may be 
questionable from an ethical standpoint but falls within the policies 
and procedures of the organization; complying with the letter of the law 
about reporting yet suppressing key negative information because it is not 
required according to reporting requirements; allowing their projects to 
continue activities that do not add to the value of the project but that fall 
within the boundaries of what is permissible; and bending the rules to 
retaliate against individuals who disagree with the current direction of 
the project.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Broaden perspective on an ethical situation or transgression by look-
ing at factors beyond compliance.
•	 Question the validity of the rules by encouraging people to think 
outside the box.
•	 Seek the insight of people who have no vested interest in the outcome 
of an ethical issue or transgression.
4.3.18  Treat Symptoms as Fact
In the contemporary project environment, the pressure to meet cost, 
schedule, and quality requirements can be immense. Circumstances often 
afford little or no time to analyze the cause of problem, no matter the 
topic. If project managers perform analysis, it is cursory at best. Often, the 
quick rather than lasting fix becomes the norm. In other words, no time is 
available to apply a PDCA cycle.
Naturally, treating symptoms as facts has its consequences. Short-term 
fixes lead to long-term problems. The project team moves into a reactive, 

92  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
rather than proactive, mode. Some people look at ways to reduce project 
costs but fail to factor in life cycle product costs. The bottom line is that 
it emphasizes the here and now and not the future. Ironically, a short-
term fix reduces costs in the present but later increases the product life 
cycles. Sometimes, the fix introduces an even more complex problem dur-
ing the project life cycle, impairing and possibly even altogether stopping 
progress.
Team members then end up in an ethical situation. They make fixes, 
knowing all too well that each fix will introduce a problem later that must 
be addressed by someone else. In other words, it encourages a lack of 
responsibility and accountability for results. Team members pass the buck 
to someone else and allow someone else to deal with the real problem. 
They knowingly let the customer assume costs in the postproject period 
that should have been assumed during the project life cycle.
Project managers can also find themselves falling into an ethical lapse. 
They figure that the effort will cause them more complications with the 
customer than if they address the problem now. They may allow a quick fix 
to avoid shattering the perception that the project is progressing accord-
ing to expectations. They may think that a customer may not know the 
difference and, therefore, that it is okay to pass the issue or problems to 
postproject support, such as sustaining and maintenance. They may even 
misreport the cause of problem by downplaying its effects, knowing all too 
well that the consequences may be costly sometime in the future.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge*:
•	 Constantly ask the three-letter question why.
•	 Persist in applying reliable tools, such as Pareto diagrams that dis-
play data revealing what are the significant causes to a problem, to 
determine the real cause behind an ethical dilemma.
•	 Rely on facts and data, rather than on intuition or opinion, to ascer-
tain the cause of a problem.
•	 Seek outside advice and opinions on dilemmas from people who do 
not have a vested interest in the outcome.
•	 Have the courage to confront ethical dilemmas regardless of the 
consequences because it is the right action.

The Ethical Trends and Challenges Confronting Project Managers  •  93
4.3.19  Reliance on Numbers
In some business circles, there is a prevailing belief that what cannot be 
measured does not matter. The emphasis is on quantified results, not on 
feelings, intuition, hearsay, or assumptions. The numbers become the 
focus and, though they are objective, they can lead to ethical dilemmas.
There are many reasons for the emphasis on numbers. First, there is at least 
the perception that numbers are tangible and, hence, objective, although 
the assumptions driving the numbers must be examined to ensure that 
some degree of objectivity is maintained. Second, numbers are tangible, 
and intuition, feelings, and hearsay are not—they tend to be highly sub-
jective and mushy. Third, the quality movement in the last 3 decades has 
emphasized metrics and measures and the use of tools to generate them. 
Finally, as mentioned earlier, people think that unmeasured work is incon-
sequential, because measurement provides focus and feedback.
The emphasis on numbers can place people in ethical dilemmas. 
Numbers could end up justifying behavior or actions that under ordinary 
circumstances would be considered unethical. Numbers can be the pri-
mary focus on reaching certain metrics but not necessarily provide a qual-
ity product—in other words, cause people to have some degree of myopia.
Some project managers emphasize numbers at the expense of ethics. 
Their focus could be on achieving numerical results rather than on the 
vision, goals, and objectives of their projects. They could actually alter their 
reports to give a skewed view of the state of their projects. Project manag-
ers may intentionally or inadvertently overlook nonmeasurable concerns 
that could be just as important as numeric considerations, thereby skew-
ing reporting.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Make a special effort to look beyond the numbers by considering 
softer areas that can relate to ethical concerns, such as attitudes, 
beliefs, and assumptions.
•	 Talk to people inside and outside the projects to see if insights cor-
roborate the numbers.
•	 Review the numbers themselves to question their validity and reli-
ability; sometimes the data are flawed and are used to generate infor-
mation; flawed data equal flawed information, which in turn can 
lead to flawed decisions.

94  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
4.3.20  Desire for Agreement
The larger the project, generally the more difficult it is to achieve agreement 
for the simple reason that larger audiences have a greater diversity of mind 
and body. While agreement is good, it is very difficult to attain; agree-
ment means that everyone must accept everything as is. Unfortunately, 
agreement is often confused with consensus, which essentially means that 
a person may not consent to something completely but understands the 
general idea and agrees to support it.
The desire for agreement has several origins. The concept of teamwork, so 
important in project management, often gets confused with having com-
plete agreement. Consequently, nothing moves forward on a project because 
not everyone agrees. Another contributor is the contemporary emphasis on 
horizontal communications; often people confuse agreement with feed-
back, thinking because someone disagrees or has questions with some data 
or information in a message nothing can move forward until the discrep-
ancy is resolved. The desire for collaboration can be a cause, too, because it 
requires people communicating with each other regularly; if agreement is 
not reached, then progress may come to a halt. Finally, the desire for unity 
of direction necessitates at least some degree of agreement; failure to achieve 
agreement, as opposed to consensus, can cause a project to come to a halt.
The desire for consensus on a project can cause people in general to 
stretch ethical limits. They inhibit expressing themselves when they 
should be doing otherwise for the good of the project. They may share 
data or information but in a way that either discounts or clouds the real 
message. They could also avoid taking the initiative for fear of upsetting 
team members or other stakeholders.
Project managers could present data or information in a way that may not 
communicate the severity of a situation. They may not take the initiative to 
resolve issues if they find that certain stakeholders may disagree. They may 
feel inhibited in expressing their thoughts or ideas for fear of any disagree-
ment arising, such as at a key point in the project life cycle. Worse, they may be 
coming up for an evaluation that requires the input of stakeholders and may 
not want to bring up controversial issues or other topics that could tarnish it.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Play the devil’s advocate whenever an issue or concern related to an 
ethical situation or transgressions is discussed.
•	 By acting as an advocate for a position, hopefully encourage open, 
insightful discussion that shatters people’s assumptions or paradigms.

The Ethical Trends and Challenges Confronting Project Managers  •  95
•	 Bring in outside experts to provide insights and raise issues that 
internal stakeholders, including the project manager, might not want 
to raise and address.
•	 Seek consensus instead of agreement; consensus means understand-
ing, acceptance, and support despite not agreeing totally; seeking 
consensus will help avoid stalemate over an issue or concern.
•	 Encourage initiative and independent thinking by setting an atmo-
sphere in projects that tolerates dissent and different viewpoints.
•	 Meet one on one with people to get new insights that would not ordi-
narily be obtained in a group meeting.
4.3.21  Maintain Positive Working Relationships with 
Vendors, Partners, and Other External Stakeholders
As mentioned earlier, the pressure to be a team player can be immense. 
It is critical to the success of a project. It is critical to success as a project 
manager. It can be critical with other stakeholders, such as vendors and 
partners. This relationship is especially important when the project must 
deliver a product to the customer. Most projects, especially medium-
sized and large ones, depend on an array of relationships internal and 
external to achieve their vision, goals, and objectives. When any or all 
of these relationships go awry, they can seriously impact the progress of 
a project.
There are several contributors to the pressure to maintain a working 
relationship with vendors, partners, and other external stakeholders. The 
globalization of businesses in general and projects in particular is one 
contributor. Another one is the rise of outsourcing to produce significant 
deliverables. Finally, the rise of manufacturing concepts such as just-in-
time, supply chain, and Lean encourage greater working relationships to 
ensure products and services arrive when needed at the right time and in 
the right quantity.
Oddly enough, the desire to maintain working relationships with ven-
dors, partners, and other stakeholders can lead to ethical complications 
for some people. Some people may intentionally or inadvertently become 
too cozy in their relationships to the point that it affects their objectivity. 
Some people may see vendors or partners as an eventual opportunity to 
increase their pay down the road, thereby clouding their judgment.
Some project managers are vulnerable to the same ethical complica-
tions. In addition to ending up in cozy relationships with vendors and 

96  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
partners, they also may skew reports without even realizing it. They may 
be impacted by what is known as the halo effect, whereby one characteris-
tic overshadows all the others; wining and dining on a regular basis at the 
expense of vendors or partners is one way to make that happen.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Insist that vendors and partners report regularly using facts and 
data; opinion and intuition are not enough on either side. Facts and 
data in reports keep the relationships from deteriorating into an 
accusatorial relationship.
•	 Build a team, not adversarial, relationship. It is all too easy for a large 
company with plenty of money to get arrogant with its partners and 
vendors. When arrogance takes hold then accusations of, for exam-
ple, poor performance or dishonesty arise on both sides, resulting in 
lack of cooperation and collaboration. Building a team relationship 
includes having suppliers and vendors in meetings for planning and 
managing projects
•	 Set up a joint infrastructure that enables open dialogue for sharing 
information and resolving differences.
•	 Make the relationship with them visible. You can ensure that suc-
cesses and failures are shared alike.
4.3.22  Protecting One’s Status and Position
Survival is a strong instinct, and when it comes to the protection of one’s 
livelihood it can of course cause people to take to act in ways that stretch 
or break ethical limits.
In recessionary periods, the threats to livelihoods are commonplace. 
Raising an ethical issue can mean doing the right thing but can also lead 
to job loss. The fate of whistle-blowers in the news is often described as 
falling on a grenade; however noble the action, the results can be devastat-
ing. Of course, another force causes people to stretch or break ethical lim-
its: outsourcing. In a world of globalization, many varieties of outsourcing 
arrangement are made that may and frequently do result in people los-
ing their livelihoods. Consequently, people are put in ethical situations or 
transgressions: save oneself or allow an ethical situation or transgression 
to arise or continue?

The Ethical Trends and Challenges Confronting Project Managers  •  97
Team members can react to this challenge in certain ways. They can 
turn their heads, so to speak, to unethical dilemmas, simply by pretending 
they do not exist. They can become a participant in the unethical decision 
or action, thinking that the benefits of participating outweigh the costs of 
being caught. They can, of course, become a whistle-blower.
Project managers also can end up in ethical complications. They, too, 
can pretend that the ethical dilemma does not exist. They can become a 
willing participant, weighing the costs and benefits. They can manipulate 
the data and information in reports to hide the ethical dilemma. They can 
encourage peer pressure to lessen the opportunity of an individual becom-
ing a whistle-blower or taking the initiative to deal with the challenge.
There are several options for dealing with this challenge:
•	 Establish and maintain open, ongoing communications, which means 
revealing negative information, with stakeholders; this approach is 
the surest way to demonstrate dedication to projects and not just 
to career.
•	 Keep an audit trail of decisions and actions about projects; this 
option allows for protecting everyone involved.
•	 Establish and maintain open communications to serve as a check to 
anyone threatening someone else about their careers.
4.4  FINAL THOUGHTS
Project managers and their projects increasingly no longer operate in 
isolation. Trends across the globe are impacting local projects in plan-
ning and executing in ways never before imagined. As the scope of a 
project increases in terms of size and complexity, the greater the likeli-
hood that these global trends will need to be considered because they can 
have ethical implications. Project managers will then have to be proactive 
rather than reactive in ethical situations as they try to deal with these 
global concerns.

How Ethics Permeates the 
Entire Project Life Cycle
The boardrooms across corporate America are not the only places for ethi-
cal dilemmas to arise. The context surrounding projects lays the ground-
work for ethical issues to occur. The nature of the projects and their context 
can play a big role on how ethics is viewed by stakeholders, whether and 
how they incorporate it in their decision making, and whether or how they 
exhibit it in their behavior.
Projects have some contextual factors that provide the opportunity for 
forcing ethical dilemmas.
5.1  CONTEXTUAL FACTORS
	
1.	Temporary existence: Projects have a short-term life and go away. 
Some people see them as opportunities to push ethical limits to the 
extreme, especially those who support projects on a contractual basis. 
They do what they’ve been tasked to do and then take off to other 
projects or locations, often without ever seeing the consequences of 
their actions. Instead, someone else will deal with the aftermath: a 
product manager or a customer, perhaps. Contractual workers can 
perform poor-quality work in a software system and someone, such 
as a customer, will experience the consequence in sustaining and 
maintenance. So why does it matter? After all, they will be gone; it’s 
someone else’s problem, they reason.

102  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
	
2.	Finites: Projects exist for a specific amount of time and then stop at 
some point. This ending has significance in that the impending clos-
ing date can encourage people to make an expeditious fix to some-
thing and, once again, not worry about the long-term consequences. 
After all, they reason, they will be long gone after the project has 
been completed. For example, they make a quick fix to a product in 
the hope that nobody will know about it if a problem occurs and, if 
it does, the warranty costs can cover the problem.
	
3.	Visibility: Projects have high visibility. At first, a project manager 
would think that a highly visible project would minimize any oppor-
tunity for an ethical dilemma to arise because key stakeholders and 
others would notice; however, a highly visible project may foster an 
ethical dilemma to arise. For example, the project manager could 
manipulate reporting data to give the perception that the project is 
progressing as planned when in reality it is the opposite.
	
4.	Time pressure: This weight on team members can be unrelenting 
on a project that must deliver a product or service over a very short 
period, such as when the project is fast-tracked. For instance, the 
completion date cannot be adjusted or the company could face sub-
stantial penalty payments for late delivery. Such a circumstance can 
encourage members of the team to go for the quick fix or fail to meet 
certain specifications in the hopes that nothing will happen or if it 
does it would be too serious.
	
5.	Temporary relationships: Project relationships among stakeholders 
are temporary. People come and go as required, sometimes never 
to return. Under such circumstances, some individuals see this as 
an opportunity to “stretch the limits,” in the expectation that they 
may never get caught. For example, a project team member may 
knowingly be rude to another person or perform some indiscrete act 
knowing that they will be gone after a short while.
In all fairness, these ethical situations and transgressions are far from the 
norm. Although the context of a project does provide the opportunity for 
unethical behavior, most people do not use it as such. Many people often 
witness unethical behavior in the workplace. The project management 
environment lays the groundwork for that to happen; it does not mean 
ethical dilemmas will happen.

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  103
5.2  FIVE MAJOR PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROCESSES
There are five major processes of project management.
Initiating is when the vision, mission, goals, objectives, and scope of the 
project are defined up front in the form of a charter, statement of work, or 
contract or a combination of all three. Sometimes, a few of the stakehold-
ers will engage in unethical behavior with the anticipation of gaining even 
more advantage once the project begins. They may not bargain in good 
faith, they may do some illegal competitive behavior, or they may even 
engage in bribery.
Planning involves determining the road map for executing the con-
tents of the charter, statement of work, or contract or a combination of all 
three. It provides the opportunity for some stakeholders to engage in a few 
unethical practices. For example, they may not provide reliable estimates 
or purposely provide scheduling information that does not eventually 
allow tracking of performance in any meaningful way.
Executing means carrying out the plans. During this process, some 
stakeholders operate under the radar by not showing up at meetings, not 
delivering on time, or refusing to share information. Some team members 
may purposely underperform during working hours so they can receive 
overtime pay in the evening.
Monitoring and controlling means keeping abreast of how well the proj-
ect is executing according to plan and in such a way that it is achieving 
its initial vision. Opportunities abound here for unethical situations and 
transgressions to arise. For example, some people may not truthfully 
report their hours worked on tasks, or they may purposely try to sabo-
tage deliverables on a project for some reason (e.g., personality conflicts). 
Vendors may not provide timely submittals on cost and schedule status for 
fear of project termination or inviting an audit on their reporting.
Closing is the process of administratively and contractually concluding 
a project. Project managers ensure that all the terms and conditions as 
well as any outstanding obligations have been met. Ethical dilemmas can 
also arise here. The vendor may pressure the conclusion of a project to 
work on another more lucrative one elsewhere, thereby not completing 
the current work thoroughly. Or final billing statements may not be sub-
mitted for some time to avoid buyer scrutiny. Certain team members may 

104  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
deliberately leave the remaining tasks unattended still bill out for them as 
they look for another position.
These project management processes do not necessarily indicate that eth-
ical dilemmas exist but simply provide opportunity for doing so. Project 
managers need to be aware that some type of unethical dilemmas could 
arise based on the context and processes of projects. It is also necessary to 
realize that not all ethical dilemmas are intentional, so people may just need 
to be aware of their occurrence and take any appropriate corrective actions.
5.3  CATEGORIES OF ETHICAL DILEMMAS
Because of the abstract nature of ethics, it is difficult to group ethical 
dilemmas into discrete categories. One effective approach, however, is to 
use an audit approach for categorizing management controls which usu-
ally includes five categories. These five categories of ethical topics are: (1) 
compliance; (2) effectiveness; (3) accurate and timely information; (4) effi-
ciency; and (5) protection of resources.
5.3.1  Compliance
This category deals with adherence to policies, procedures, laws, and regu-
lations. It is perhaps the most common topic of ethics about which people 
are knowledgeable, since penalties can be severe, can become public, and 
can become litigious on a personal level.
Project managers in today’s environment are getting increasingly 
involved in compliance, thanks in part to the corporate scandals and 
social legislation of the last 3 decades. Greater emphasis on protection of 
personal information and intellectual property, environmental regula-
tions, financial oversight, employee relations, and much more has caused 
project managers to look beyond just delivering a product or service to 
compliance and the consequences of their or other stakeholders’ actions. 
What adds to the complexity is that some of these laws and regulations are 
often unclear and contradictory.
Also, the time and cost pressures can become immense, causing some 
people to take shortcuts to receive a bonus; however, the consequences 
could have far-reaching compliance issues. 

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  105
5.3.2  Effectiveness
This category addresses the achievement of goals and objectives. A goal 
in this context is a broad statement of intent; an objective is something 
measurable to know when the goal has been achieved.
Effectiveness is an ethical area because project managers are respon-
sible for achieving results with the resources entrusted to them. Using 
resources in a way that subverts the achievement of goals and objectives is 
a violation of trust. This simple relationship between goals and objectives 
is in reality not that simple for project managers. Goals and objectives 
within the project must be achieved; however, often projects are part of 
a much bigger organization, which requires that projects be aligned with 
its goals and objectives. In theory, they should be in alignment; in reality, 
often they are contradictory. Project managers can also find themselves in 
a difficult position where the higher organization’s goals and objectives are 
at odds with the customer’s.
This circumstance can place immense pressure on people and can lead 
to ethical dilemmas. Politics can become overwhelmingly important, so 
much so that some people will overcommit to some and underdeliver to 
others. Naturally, this can lead to circumstances where the project man-
agers and other stakeholders find themselves providing misinformation, 
even disinformation, to certain stakeholders.
5.3.3  Accurate and Timely Information
This category deals with ensuring that the right people get the right infor-
mation in the right amount in the right format at the right time. People 
often confuse information with data; the two are not synonymous. Data 
are raw and have no value to anyone. Information is data converted into 
something meaningful to the recipient. The challenge is to link data and 
information in a manner that ensures accurate and timely delivery of 
the latter.
Providing accurate and timely information is an ethical concern because 
many stakeholders in the project environment rely on information to 
make decisions. An unethical person can corrupt data that, in turn, gen-
erates unreliable information without anyone realizing it. For example, 
entering bogus data into a time-reporting tool that generates information 
for key executive stakeholders can lead to making ineffective decisions.

5.3.4  Efficiency
This category deals with using resources in a manner that reduces waste. 
For every unit of currency spent, ideally there should be some incremental 
increase in return.
Efficiency is an ethical area of concern because stakeholders have 
entrusted project managers with using resources in a manner that is not 
profligate. Projects are investments and like all investments should be 
managed with care. Project managers, to a certain extent, are entrusted 
agents for their company and are responsible for ensuring that investors 
in their project get the appropriate return for their money.
Opportunities abound on projects for violating the ethical side of effi-
ciency. Some examples include individuals deliberately underperforming 
during regular hours to earn overtime pay in the evening. Some people 
take trips, affectionately referred to as boondoggles, that offer little or no 
return to the outcome of the project. Such waste demonstrates a disregard 
for responsibly managing the resources of projects.
5.3.5  Protection of Resources
This category is about the ethical area related to the physical and logical 
safekeeping of the project’s resources. Physical resources deal with equip-
ment, supplies, and other tangible assets. Logical resources pertain to 
nontangible items like information and intellectual property.
Protection of resources is an ethical area because, again, it involves 
entrusting project managers to ensure that monies invested by manage-
ment and shareholders, for example, are not squandered or used inap-
propriately. The project environment offers opportunities for unethical 
transgressions. For example, some people may use information or tech-
nology for personal use during the course of the project, or they may dis-
close information in a manner that fails to respect the need for privacy or 
the protection of proprietary information, either for their own firm or for 
that of their partners.
5.4  ETHICS AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROCESSES
This section identifies some common ethical dilemmas that occur when 
executing each of the five process groups (i.e., initiating, planning, 

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  107
executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing). Each one is in turn 
associated with one or more of the five ethical categories. Many of these 
ethical dilemmas overlap; however, for purposes of the discussion, they 
are treated separately.
5.4.1  Initiating and Ethics
The significance of ethical dilemmas during initiating is that they can 
have a downstream impact on all five process groups and phases of a proj-
ect and will also span across all five ethical categories (Table 5.1).
5.4.2  Low-Balling
During the initiating process of a project, stakeholders all have some inter-
est that needs to be satisfied. In many cases, the buyer (i.e., the company

purchasing materials or services) and the seller (i.e., the company provid-
ing materials or services) seek to have an agreement. Sometimes, however, 
the seller may intentionally underbid with the hope of beating out compe-
tition and then, once winning the contract, will decide to change the work 
order to make up for the initial loss. Low-balling can, of course, have seri-
ous negative ramifications, which include a buyer feeling taken advantage 
of or having a sense of being misled and, perhaps most importantly, a lack 
of trust that permeates the entire relationship. In the end, it wastes the 
buyer’s resources, that is, the project. If low-balling occurs at the begin-
ning of a project it is a bad sign of what is to come.
Low-balling can be addressed by asking questions about vendor capa-
bilities early in the negotiating process, conducting a risk assessment to 
determine where low-balling could occur and when it could have the big-
gest impact, and researching, for example, the present standards.
5.4.3  Omitting Key Stakeholders
If the intent is to purposely omit key stakeholders during the initiating 
phase, an ethical dilemma may be in the works. The stakeholders may 
be working together to bring a project into an organization through the 
back door; once the project is started, the other stakeholders are essen-
tially compelled to accept, sometimes through organizational politics. The 
consequences include increasingly more politics in the decision making of 
the project, greater levels of mistrust among stakeholders, and encourage-
ment of subtle ways to negatively impact the progress of the project. All of 
this can also lead to waste in terms of time, effort, and money.
Omitting key stakeholders can be addressed by conducting a thor-
ough stakeholder analysis, creating a stakeholder register to help in 
performing the analysis, and working to get all the key stakeholders 
engaged during the initiating process by participating in the develop-
ment and approval of a charter, statement of work, cost analysis, and con-
tract formulation.
5.4.4  Misaligning with Organizational Goals
This ethical dilemma depends on intent. Sometimes an organization 
will start projects with the intent of achieving organizational goals and 
objectives. During the initiating process, a charter and other support-
ing documentation are developed emphasizing that the project will help 

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  109
accomplish the goals and objectives of the organization, when in reality it 
serves some other purpose. However, the organization fails eventually to 
provide sufficient oversight of the project. The project manager or some 
other stakeholder then purposely steers the project in a different direction, 
knowing full well the project is operating according to some other prior-
ity, perhaps the stakeholders’ own goals and objectives. The consequences 
include a misuse of resources to achieve unintended goals and objectives.
Misalignment with organizational goals can be addressed by keeping all 
the stakeholders’ focus on the organizational goals and objectives when 
developing the charter and establishing processes and procedures to ver-
ify alignment to them throughout the project life cycle.
5.4.5  Conflicting Interest
During initiating, stakeholders should not have any previous background 
or assets that could impair their judgment related to objectivity and inde-
pendence. This is especially the case when negotiating with external stake-
holders. Examples might include a stakeholder with a substantial amount 
of stock in a company who will be awarded a contract increasing the value 
of that stock. The consequences are that a conflict of interest can lead to all 
sorts of civil and criminal problems as well as can result in using company 
resources leading to personal benefit.
Conflicts of interest can be addressed by keeping people aware of the 
need to comply with company processes and procedures regarding that 
topic. These conflicts, even mere appearances of them, should be dealt 
with immediately to ensure that no complications arise later, such as just 
prior to completion of a major milestone. Of course, project managers are 
the main people who should avoid having a conflict of interest, because 
execution of their responsibilities is so tied to credibility.
5.4.6  Not Clarifying Expectations
In the beginning, all the key stakeholders have expectations. These are some-
times clearly articulated; at other times, they are vague and intentionally left 
so. Vague expectations can provide the opportunity for some stakeholders 
to exploit the working relationship vis-à-vis others. Project managers should 
make every effort to clarify and pinpoint expectations to ensure such exploi-
tation does not occur. Besides helping to improve communications and 
allowing for focus on achieving results, clarifying expectations encourages 

110  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
greater levels of trust among stakeholders because the opportunity to take 
advantage of one of the parties lessens. The consequences of intentionally 
not clarifying expectations will only lead only to distrust, resulting in less 
focus on achieving results and waste due to always needing to verify.
Expectations can be clarified by addressed them during initiating in general 
and in particular when negotiating the project charter. Clarifying expecta-
tions not only enables focusing later on in the project but also provides a great 
way to bridge differences and maintain dialogue among all stakeholders.
5.4.7  Lying to Win Contract
Lying, misrepresentation, fabricating the truth, or whatever you call it is 
not a good idea during initiating. Stakeholders may get what they want in 
the beginning, but once lies are discovered, then the performance of the 
project begins to deteriorate. Distrust and mistrust, for example, will per-
meate the entire atmosphere surrounding the project. Not only does lying 
have legal consequences, but it also impacts the ability to monitor progress 
on a project because the data and eventual information become suspect. 
This results in laborious efforts to check and recheck everything regarding 
the status of a project once it gets implemented.
Lying to win a contract can be addressed provided that open, ongoing 
communications and exchange of information occurs on a project. If and 
when a stakeholder is being less than truthful and the project manager 
knows it, he has an obligation to confront the issue. Credibility is key, not 
just for him but among all the major stakeholders; the minute credibility 
is lost then suspicion takes over.
5.4.8  Sabotaging Relationships with Certain Stakeholders
In the beginning of a project, especially for those outside of a company, 
certain stakeholders on the project may prefer one vendor over another. 
During negotiations, some stakeholders may deliberately try to denigrate 
one vendor to give the competitive advantage to another for whatever rea-
son (e.g., conflict of interest). The consequences are that, even if another 
vendor does sign an agreement, tension rises due to mistrust and being 
slighted. All of this leads to loss of effectiveness and efficiency because of 
the inevitable infighting among stakeholders.
Sabotaging relationships during initiating can be addressed several 
ways. It is first important to strive to develop and maintain a working 

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  111
relationship among stakeholders through open and honest dialogue not 
just between project managers and stakeholders but among stakeholders 
themselves. Second, if project managers see sabotage occurring, however 
subtle, they must raise the matter up the chain of command to at least 
make upper management aware that it is happening and to articulate its 
eventual impact to the project.
5.4.9  Not Engaging in Good Faith Negotiations
In a sense, all of the previous ethical situations and transgressions are exam-
ples of not negotiating in good faith. This one, however, is broader in the sense 
that it is the intent of the negotiation. The idea here is that not negotiating in 
good faith is trying to achieve a result through the use of unethical behavior 
(e.g., lying, stealing). Failure to negotiate in good faith (not the same as being 
gullible) has considerable consequences. Trust and communications break 
down, effectiveness and efficiency decline because no one trusts any results, 
regardless of scale, and verification and validation thus become the norm.
Not engaging in good faith negotiations can be addressed by doing 
the opposite: engaging in good faith negotiations. This is demonstrated 
by being open and honest about information with internal and external 
stakeholders. Of course, with external stakeholders, the interests of the 
company must still be protected.
5.5  PLANNING AND ETHICS
The significance of ethical issues during planning is that they can lead to 
poor and inaccurate reporting because the cost, schedule, and scope base-
lines are not realistic. Consequently, accurate and timely reporting will 
have the greatest impact (Table 5.2).
5.5.1  Padding
One of the most misunderstood ethical dilemmas is padding, which is 
augmenting an estimate to account for any unknowns. What most people 
do is confuse this one with adding a contingency, a calculated determina-
tion of a resource amount to deal with a certain contingency. Padding 
is random and usually across the board without much forethought; 

112  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
contingency estimating is setting aside a specific amount of resources 
(e.g., time, money) to deal with a scenario should it occur.
Padding becomes an ethical dilemma because it provides an erroneous 
basis for calculating time and cost estimates and may mislead whoever is 
given a proposal. It also leads to artificially inflating estimates and may 
result in eventually overcharging the customer.
Perhaps the biggest consequences with padding is that it can lead to 
wastefully applying resources to activities that do not add much value 
while simultaneously taking resources away from those that add value to 
the customer. It can also mean that the customer overpays for some activi-
ties and underpays for others, thus creating waste.
Padding can be addressed in several ways. One way is to request that 
stakeholders estimate costs using statistically reliable estimating tech-
niques, such as parametric and three-point estimating. Another way is to 
have in-depth reviews of all estimating assumptions done by team mem-
bers to cross-check for bad estimates. Finally, estimating standards can be

provided for certain categories of tasks, based on either historical records 
or industry standards.
5.5.2  No Accountability
Translated, no one is held responsible for delivering results. Instead, the 
project operates, as the U.S. Army says, as a chicken with its head cut off. 
Few people, if any, know who is to do what and when to deliver. Assumed 
roles, responsibilities, and authorities overlap. No one, it seems, is in charge 
or knows what is happening.
Naturally, the consequences are quite clear. No one is held responsible 
for achieving results; therefore, few will once the project goes into execu-
tion. Typically, meetings upon meetings pile up with no results and no end 
in sight. In addition, resources are squandered, perhaps even lost, even 
before the project moves into execution.
This ethical dilemma can be addressed by creating a responsibility 
matrix that reflects roles and responsibilities based on a solid work break-
down structure to ensure that the goals and objectives will be achieved 
once the project moves into execution.
5.5.3  Lying
This, as is initiating, is an ethical issue. Under no circumstance should it 
occur. Human nature, of course, deviates from this principle from time 
to time. During planning, lying can occur quite frequently, as might be 
suspected, especially as it relates to time and cost estimates. It is important 
to realize that poor estimating may not be the result of lying and, quite 
frankly, is often the case. Lying is a deliberate action to deceive and often 
it tied to other ethical issues like low-balling.
Lying has many consequences. From a planning standpoint, it results 
in allocating resources to incorrect priorities and can eventually delay the 
execution of a project in an effort to seek additional resources or reallocate 
them. Both cases lead to inefficiency and ineffectiveness.
Lying can be addressed using several tools and techniques. Each stake-
holder’s estimates can be cross-checked, assumptions made by estimators 
can be revisited, the results of projects of a similar nature can be reviewed, 
and outside experts can be brought in.

114  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
5.6  EXECUTING AND ETHICS
The significance of ethical dilemmas during executing is that they can 
lead to a project not following the baselines and, subsequently, getting out 
of control. Adhering to plans becomes more difficult as stakeholders fail to 
act as a team because each is likely following a different or misinterpreted 
vision and not performing according to plans. All ethical dilemmas are 
impacted (Table 5.3), though effectiveness is the hardest hit.
5.6.1  Mischarging
Mischarging is not uncommon and basically involves charging to the 
wrong account number for the work performed, which can cause all sorts 
of complications. Mischarging can result in a customer being charged for 
work that was never authorized, can cause accounting complications, and 
can possibly lead to legal issues, especially when it involves government 
contracts. Mischarging, when it happens accidentally, is not much of an 
issue because it can often be corrected; it becomes serious when it is bla-
tant, persistent, and uncorrected. A company can face civil and criminal 
liability, and so can individuals.
Mischarging can be minimized in several ways. Start by ensuring that 
everyone knows exactly what the charge numbers are available to them 
and under what circumstances they are to be charged to. A periodic audit 
of charging practices can also be conducted to ensure compliance.
5.6.2  Misinformation or Disinformation
Information is one of the greatest resources of a project. When that infor-
mation is tainted in some way, it can have undesirable consequences. 
Misinformation is spread unintentionally, and disinformation is spread 
intentionally; both are deliberately false. Regardless of the intent, when 
incorrect information is spread, it can affect the quality of decisions, hurt 
the ability to execute good decisions, cause rework, create confusion, and 
perhaps most importantly destroy trust among stakeholders.
Several actions can be taken to deal with misinformation and disinforma-
tion. Continuous communication among stakeholders can be encouraged, 
information used on the project can be verified and cross-checked, outside

opinions can be sought to verify information, and effective listening skills 
can be applied.
5.6.3  Straying from the Plan without Authorization
One of the quickest ways projects get into trouble is that they fail to follow 
their plan. Instead, a good plan is placed on a shelf, and the project goes on a 
different course. Sometimes this is by design; sometimes it is not. Regardless, 
to allow straying from a plan without authorization has several consequences. 
It can lead to scope creep, which is an unintended expansion of what the 
project was supposed to accomplish. It can also lead to rework to make up 
for work not done or to undo work. To allow straying from a plan is a viola-
tion of a promise to deliver according to expectations held by the customer.
Straying from plans without authorization can be prevented by ensur-
ing good integrated change management processes and procedures are 
in place, reviewing periodically performance against the plan, publish-
ing responsibilities identified in the plan, and simply referring to the plan 
throughout the execution of the project.
5.6.4  Violating Confidentiality
Whether in an organizational relationship (e.g., partnership) or in a per-
son-to-person relationship, confidentiality is essentially for building trust 
and collaborating on a project. Violating confidentiality means not spread-
ing entrusted data or information. If it occurs, the consequences can be 
quite apparent. People no longer share information, people are not invited 
to meetings, and politics become rampant. Sometimes all this can result in 
litigation for violating agreements and releasing proprietary information.
Violations of confidentiality can be avoided by stressing the importance 
of protecting proprietary information, instituting processes and proce-
dures to prevent protected data and information from being released, and 
reporting to the appropriate organization or people when it occurs.
5.6.5  Jeopardizing Working Relationships
Collaboration is key among stakeholders if a project is to be completed 
successfully. An interdependent relationship among all stakeholders 
often exists. Occasionally, however, relationships go awry. Politics and 

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  117
personality differences, for example, interfere with this collaboration. 
The situation can deteriorate so much that people no longer want to work 
with each other. Some people deliberately do whatever they can to jeopar-
dize relationships, and it is unfair to the other stakeholders to allow these 
actions to continue. Failure to address purposely jeopardizing working 
relationships has several consequences, including lowering team morale, 
decreasing productivity, and causing other people to assume an unreason-
able workload.
To address this issue, people who purposely try to jeopardize working 
relationships can be confronted, the issue can be forced out in the open, 
and the parties involved can be influenced to resolve their differences. 
Greater team building can also be encouraged among tasks.
5.6.6  Violating Employee Rights
While there is plenty of talk of respecting employee rights, the reality is 
that quite often they are violated, particularly when an economy goes into 
a tailspin. The employer–employee relationship sometimes gets strained if 
the power relationship between the two gets altered. Once in awhile, some-
one in a position of authority can, either by design or by accident, abuse 
their position in such a way that violates employee rights. For example, this 
can also occur among peers as team members on a project, fearful of los-
ing their jobs, pressure people to leave or ostracize them if one individual 
does not conform. Of course, under either scenario, this behavior can have 
several consequences. The pressure can inhibit discussion and participa-
tion, thereby reducing the overall effectiveness of the team. It can also lead 
to legal complications if the violation of right becomes too extreme.
Several actions can be taken to prevent the violation of employee rights. 
A concerted effort can be made to engage stakeholders in key discussion to 
encourage not only support but also a feeling of inclusion. The issue can be 
confronted right away when the violation occurs. The issue can then be 
taken to higher levels if it seems the ethical dilemma could lead to legal 
complications.
5.6.7  Vilifying Peers
Also known as character assassination, vilifying peers can lead to very 
bad working relationships. There are many ways people can impugn the 

118  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
character of an individual; some of it is direct, though more often it is indi-
rect. An example of direct vilifying is sending out inflammatory e-mails 
or blatantly attacking a person’s character during meetings. An example of 
indirect vilifying is spreading innuendos about someone. Vilifying peers 
is an ethical dilemma that can generate in demoralization of the project 
team, which impacts its productivity and overall effectiveness.
It is necessary to ensure that vilification is stopped at its source. 
Otherwise, the project will be imperiled; the problem is no one wants to 
admit to or to address vilification. It takes courage to take the step, but 
project managers need to call people who are doing this out as soon as 
possible. Some actions to take include going to the source of the vilifica-
tion, bringing the parties involved together to resolve their differences, 
and agreeing to stop further character assassination. If necessary, elevate 
the issue to the company’s human resources department or upper man-
agement team members if it becomes intolerable to the victim.
5.6.8  Deliberately Underperforming
Underperforming for the sole purpose of negatively impacting a project 
is an ethical dilemma for the simple reason that value is not being deliv-
ered to the project. More money is going out than is coming in as a result. 
People deliberately underperform for several reasons. They were unhappy 
being assigned to the project in the first place, they do not like the project 
manager or some of the other team members, they believe the project is 
doomed to failure, or they see the project as a stepping stone to a better 
position or project.
Failure to deal with someone who is underperforming can have harmful 
effects on a project. It can negatively affect the pace or momentum of the 
project, can cause others to unfairly assume more of the workload, can 
result in rework, and can lead to increased overhead costs.
Several actions can be taken to deal with stakeholders who are deliber-
ately underperforming. A request can be made that the person be removed 
from the team, the person can be given responsibilities that have a minor 
influence on the outcome of the project, the person can be teamed with 
another who is a hard charger to induce the former to produce, and peer 
pressure can be applied by showcasing the performance of others and the 
lack of the person’s performance.

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  119
5.6.9  Squashing Dissent
This is an ethical dilemma because it violates individuals’ right to be honest 
about their performance on a project or, indeed, its overall performance. 
On some projects, even the best performing ones, team members experi-
ence groupthink, in which they suppress differences of opinion, acquire a 
feeling of superiority, even invincibility, and have the illusion, even deni-
ability, of reality. Team members think the team is effective, but in reality 
it may not be very effective at all because it filters out information that 
may be necessary to adapt to changing circumstances. It also inhibits the 
accurate dissemination and reporting of information.
Several actions can be taken to offset the danger of squashing dissent. 
New people can be brought onboard to provide fresh insight on issues 
and challenges. External consultants can be sought for a fresh opinion. 
Stakeholders who were ringleaders and who have contributed to groupthink 
can be removed. An adversarial stance can be taken by the project manager 
on key issues, challenges, and concerns just to shake up people’s thinking.
5.6.10  Ignoring Needs of Team Members
Project managers are responsible for satisfying the needs of stakeholders, 
including members of their team. Stakeholders have a wide range of needs 
of which project managers need to be aware if they hope to motivate them 
in a way that increases their performance. It becomes an ethical dilemma 
if their needs are deliberately ignored when it comes to getting the job 
done. Since project managers are responsible for the overall performance 
of the team, they need to find out what those needs are and try to satisfy 
them with the means under their control. To do otherwise is not taking 
responsibility for the overall performance of the team. Obviously, failure 
to address those needs will impact both the efficiency and effectiveness of 
both the individual and the overall team.
This ethical dilemma can be addressed by maintaining an ongoing dia-
logue with each team member, keeping team members posted regarding 
the status of their requests, finding alternative ways to develop at least an 
interim solution to help fulfill their needs, and, if money or time is in short 
supply, performing a cost–benefit analysis and asking for more money or 
time or coming up with a more effective way to complete the project.

120  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
5.6.11  Lacking Reliable, Consistent Treatment of Team Members
On many teams, not everyone is equal; some team members will rise to a 
position of superiority relative to the others. Often, they will receive pref-
erential treatment while others are left with little or no influence. Social 
scientists refer to this as the iron law of oligarchy. Unfortunately, this iron 
law can get so extreme that it ends up demoralizing some team members. 
A project manager can fall into the trap of supporting a few and disregard-
ing the others. The implications are clear with this sort of behavior. Some 
people will tune out by keeping silent and not participating; some will do 
what they can to sabotage any progress; still others, oftentimes the most 
skillful, will depart. This, as might be suspected, affects the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the team in a negative way.
Several actions can be taken to prevent this ethical dilemma from aris-
ing. Everyone at meetings should at least be asked for their insights or 
opinions. Key assignments can be rotated to ensure that everyone has the 
opportunity to participate in the project’s outcome. People can be teamed 
up with some of the perceived favorites to share the visibility.
5.6.12  Not Encouraging Collaboration
While at first this might not seem like an ethical issue, it is. If the proj-
ect manager or any team members deliberately encourage divisiveness 
for personal gain, the emphasis is on personal needs and not that of the 
project. A project that is efficient and effective requires the collaboration 
of all stakeholders. A project manager needs to make collaboration a top 
priority; otherwise, the project will not operate at peak levels. Failure to 
collaborate, therefore, can impact a project by reducing the payback for 
every dollar invested that does not meet the goals and objectives of the 
project. In addition, it could lead to infighting and negative competition.
Collaboration can be encouraged by implementing greater team-­
building activities and events. Successful collaborative events can be 
rewarded in addition to individual achievements. Another approach is 
greater sharing of information and team participation in resolving ethical 
dilemmas, such as brainstorming.
5.6.13  Dismissing without Cause
Removing a team member may make sense for the good of the team, but 
it is necessary to have a cause for doing so other than disagreeing with a 

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  121
person’s style. Frequently, personality differences lead to this dilemma, 
but this does not warrant their dismissal unless the differences are so 
pronounced that the project suffers. If people are removed from a proj-
ect because of personality or viewpoint differences, it can have negative 
impacts, such as creating an atmosphere of groupthink, not acquiring 
innovative ideas to further the progress of a project, and losing poten-
tially valuable expertise and knowledge. Project managers who dismiss 
without cause are committing an ethical violation because they are 
making such decisions not in the interests of their projects but for their 
own comfort. They could also set themselves up for being embroiled in 
legal complications.
To dismiss a team member in an ethical manner, facts and data must 
be used. A good faith effort must also be made to resolve differences first 
using conflict management skills.
5.6.14  Sending a Defective Product to a Customer
Although rarely done on purpose, knowingly sending a defective product 
to a customer is clearly an unethical issue. Essentially, expectations were 
not met, and the team is trying to abdicate responsibility. Actions exem-
plifying this unethical behavior include circumventing testing standards, 
purposely letting the sustaining and maintenance portion of the product 
life cycle absorb the costs of poor work, and putting the parent organiza-
tions and stakeholder reputations at risk. This is a failure of due diligence 
and due care, which could lead to potential legal complications related to 
compliance with laws and regulations.
Several actions can be taken to avoid sending a defective product to the 
customer. Standards and guidelines and testing processes can be adhered 
to, metrics on defects can be published, and quality tools and techniques 
(e.g., Ishikawa diagramming, Pareto charts) can be used.
5.6.15  Unauthorized Copying
Violation of copyright laws is serious business, although it is often difficult 
to prove and can be costly to win a case. In some cases, however, it can 
be rather obvious. Unauthorized copying is not restricted to the printed 
word; it covers other areas such as drawings and software. It can also get 
complicated when working on a joint venture and dealing with intellectual 
property. Obviously, the biggest impact to a project is the failure to comply 

122  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
with the copyright laws; there is also the threat of civil and criminal liti-
gation by failing to protect either the organization’s or a partner’s assets.
Copyright laws can be followed by ensuring everyone is aware of what 
is and is not permissible under them. People can also cross-check each 
other’s work, thereby increasing the likelihood of detecting any violations.
5.6.16  Lacking Consistent Enforcement of Standards
Everyone should follow the same standards on a project team. If exceptions 
are made, then one of them will likely, ironically, be the rule. Standards 
enable everyone to work together and more often than not reduce dupli-
cation of effort. Unfortunately, requiring consistent enforcement of stan-
dards can be difficult because sometimes team members like to put their 
personal stamp on the work. This situation makes it difficult to sustain or 
maintain the deliverable in the future and for team members to work col-
laboratively in achieving the goals and objectives of the project. In stan-
dards related to topics like safety, it can also result in lack of compliance 
with laws and regulations.
Several things can be done to ensure better consistent enforcement of stan-
dards. The project manager can model the standards personally, can com-
municate the standards, and can require review and testing according to the 
standards to include publishing metrics on failure to comply with standards.
5.7  MONITORING AND CONTROLLING AND ETHICS
The significance of ethical dilemmas during monitoring and controlling is 
that it becomes difficult to ascertain how the project is progressing accord-
ing to plan. The reason is that the information is unreliable and inaccu-
rate. The impact of many of these ethical issues may be compounded by 
ethical dilemmas arising during the other project management processes 
(e.g., initiating, planning) (Table 5.4).
5.7.1  Misreporting
Intentionally not reporting accurate information about the performance 
of the project is an ethical issue and transgression and can occur for many 

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  123
reasons. The project manager or other key stakeholder may misreport 
to avoid embarrassment or negative ramifications for themselves and 
the parent organization. It may occur because of the desire to receive an 
award, such as an award fee if applicable, from the customer. Team mem-
bers may figure that the misreporting will be compensated for in antici-
pated future performance, thereby making it a nonissue. Whatever the 
reason, mis­reporting has severe consequences. It can lead to legal issues 
with key stakeholders, such as shareholders using financial legislation to 
seek redress. It can also lead to management making poor decisions that 
only further complicate a project’s troubles.
The likelihood of misreporting can be removed by validating the data 
used to generate reports, establishing ongoing, consistent reporting on

progress to key stakeholders, and distributing reports to key stakeholders, 
such as steering committee members, who ask questions regarding the 
meaning behind the content of the reports.
5.7.2  Massaging or Not Sharing Information 
with Critical Stakeholders
In a project environment, reliable information is critical for making 
important decisions by key stakeholders. Without critical information 
some key stakeholders can make decisions that can negatively affect the 
outcome of a project. This can result in a company becoming legally liable 
for not demonstrating due diligence in its reporting because the informa-
tion presented does not portray an accurate view.
Sometimes, key information is not delivered to key stakeholders or is 
massaged in such a way that the stakeholders fail to ascertain the informa-
tion’s significance. It could be due to politics, fear (e.g., shoot the messen-
ger), or just neglectfulness on the part of people preparing, for example, a 
report containing the information.
This situation becomes an ethical issue if the intent is to purposely keep 
certain key stakeholders in the dark or to fulfill some nefarious purpose, 
such as making political gains or avoiding reality in the hope that the situ-
ation will go away.
This ethical situation can be prevented by developing a communica-
tions management plan and following it, developing a standard set of 
reports that are produced and distributed regularly, and inviting key 
stakeholders to participate in the affairs of the project. A periodic project 
review can also be requested in which the results are communicated up 
the chain of command.
5.7.3  Not Using Reliable Data to Generate Information
Data by itself have no meaning; data coupled with meaning to serve a 
purpose are called information. All information, therefore, depends 
on data, and the quality of the latter affects the quality of the former. 
Information, in turn, supports decision making, and bad data lead to bad 
information, which may lead to bad decision making because the content 
lacks accuracy.

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  125
It becomes an ethical dilemma when project team members carelessly 
generate data that will be used to create information for decision mak-
ers. They have violated the trust bestowed upon them by key stakeholders 
to provide reliable data. These stakeholders include not only the proj-
ect manager or sponsor but also other members of senior management 
and shareholders.
Not using reliable data to generate information can be avoided by scrub-
bing, or cleansing, data before they are used to generate information, veri-
fying data for validity and reliability, and conducting walkthroughs or 
peer reviews of reports prior to their release.
5.7.4  Not Using Plans to Report Progress
Amazingly, many project managers and their team go through major 
efforts to develop comprehensive plans and then execute the project with-
out ever using the plans as a road map. As a consequence, team members 
run around helter-skelter, resources are expended needlessly on rework 
to fix defects, and tension runs high as finger-pointing often becomes the 
norm. All of this leads to waste.
This has ethical consequences for several reasons. If the plans were pre-
sented to a steering team for approval and then the team takes a differ-
ent direction from what was approved, the team is disingenuous because 
it deviates from what was promised. Also, reporting on progress may be 
based on conjecture or even deliberate misleading to key stakeholders, 
from senior management to shareholders.
This ethical issue can be appropriately dealt with by using all baselines 
(e.g., schedule, cost, scope) to track performance, conducting ongoing sta-
tus review meetings to discuss performance to those baselines, or sending 
fact-based reports to key stakeholders on a regular basis.
5.7.5  Deliberately Not Reporting Bad News
This one is tied closely with misreporting. In this situation, report-
ing becomes very selective. Only the good news is reported all the time. 
Experienced project managers know that few, if any, projects go smoothly. 
Yet, occasionally, a project manager reports that everything is going per-
fectly well: Cost, schedule, and technical performance are all in the green. 

126  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
Then, at the last minute the project fails to deliver. Such behavior puts a 
company at risk with authorities as well as causes decision makers to make 
poor decisions.
There are ethical concerns here. The information portrayed by the proj-
ect manager is clearly an attempt to deceive for many reasons, often for 
advancement or fear. Often there is an attitude that perception is reality; 
this is obviously false when the schedule begins to slide, the costs start to 
escalate, and rework becomes the norm. Then, if it is a big project that can 
impact investors, it can lead to legal issues.
Several steps can be taken to ensure that balanced reporting occurs on a 
project. Certain stakeholders should review reports prior to their release. 
Metrics should be established based on reliable data to be a major element 
in the reports; facts and data are more often than not good antidotes to 
poor reporting. All facts, data, and assumptions that provide information 
for the reports should be challenged.
5.7.6  Inflating Expense Reports
Managing against a cost baseline is obviously very critical to a project’s 
success. Few projects exist where money is no object. Unfortunately, some 
people take advantage of a project, especially when it involves travel. If 
the expense reports are not scrutinized carefully, then costs can eas-
ily escalate and could actually lead to legal issues because customers are 
billed for expenses that should never have happened. These reports, too, 
often contain erroneous or unclear information and, a clear warning sign, 
are submitted late in the hopes that they will be approved without being 
examined with a pile of other expense reports.
The inflation of expense reports can be prevented, as much as possi-
ble, by setting a limit on costs for travel and training, reviewing certain 
expenses that exceed a certain threshold, assigning someone on the team 
to review all expense reports prior to approval, and setting standards for 
what is and is not permissible. Ideally, someone independent to the project 
should perform this function, which is not always possible in a small or 
even medium-size firm.
5.7.7  Destroying or Stealing Vital Information
Data and information are the property of the organization and not the 
individuals working on the team. Some people think that just because they 

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  127
created or developed information they own it. In reality, the parent orga-
nization owns it in exchange for a salary or a work-for-hire agreement. 
Destroying or stealing vital information can result in legal complexities, 
especially if it violates confidentiality agreements regarding proprietary 
information. It can cause the project to fail because of a loss of important 
information used when creating deliverables. It also violates the trust that 
the organization gives individuals to protect its resources.
It is pretty clear that destroying or stealing vital issues is an ethical 
issue. Any theft of company information or other resources or their wan-
ton destruction, however perceived justified by an individual, is an ethical 
violation of trust.
Attempts can be made to reduce the impact of this ethical dilemma, 
but it is difficult to prevent. If a person is determined to do it, only its 
impact can be minimized by, for example, making backups of informa-
tion, reporting any suspected activity related to this dilemma, and secur-
ing vital information by restricting access to it.
5.8  CLOSING AND ETHICS
The significance of ethical dilemmas during closing is that they can lead 
to litigation, reputational damage, and poor customer satisfaction. All 
ethical areas are impacted (Table 5.5), although effectiveness is the hard-
est hit.

128  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
5.8.1  Not Delivering Results as Promised
It is one thing to not deliver as promised due to some technical difficulty 
on a project; it is another to not deliver while all along giving the impres-
sion that expectations will be met at the conclusion of a project. Dashed 
expectations under the latter are a genuine effort to mislead key stakehold-
ers. The project, for which it exists in the first place, not only becomes a 
waste of money but also does not add any value to the organization.
To a large extent, not delivering results under such circumstances is 
coupled with other ethical dilemmas, such as lying and deliberately not 
reporting bad news. Throughout the entire life cycle of such a project few, 
if any, project management disciplines and information are available for 
performance. In a sense, such projects operate under the radar until the 
last minute, leaving key stakeholders with dashed expectations. Of course, 
the key stakeholders need to be continuously vigilant about all projects, 
but once in awhile, particularly in large organizations, some projects oper-
ate for quite some time under the radar until it is too late for key stake-
holders, such as shareholders.
This ethical dilemma can be avoided by developing a standard set of 
reports (known as a report deck) that is replete with important metrics. 
You can then distribute the report deck on a regular basis to key stake-
holders. If the project is big enough, a steering committee should also be 
established and special effort should be made to keep them engaged.
5.8.2  Not Satisfying Contractual Requirements
This one is closely tied to the last one but is more focused on the terms 
and conditions of the contract. The project comes down to the end, and 
then the project manager reveals that certain terms and conditions will 
not be met. In this case, the major expectations overall may be met, but 
there are certain terms and conditions that were overlooked intentionally 
during the contract. Now the customer has no other choice but to yield to 
accept the product simply because it needs the product, for example, to 
obtain competitive advantage in the marketplace. If the project manager 
has not kept the sponsor or customer apprised throughout the project life 
cycle with the intent to mislead, it becomes an ethical dilemma that can 
lead to litigation and higher sustaining and maintenance cost later.
This ethical dilemma can be prevented by engaging the customer and 
the sponsor on the project to one extent or another, keeping them apprised 

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  129
of progress on a regular basis, and continually comparing performance 
with contractual requirements.
5.8.3  Falsifying Records
Occasionally, to cover up mistakes or to disguise their failure to perform 
their responsibilities, someone will falsify records. This may happen when 
fees for performance are distributed during and at the conclusion of a proj-
ect. The hope is often that if the project winds down and the customer is 
happy then the likelihood of getting caught diminishes unless, of course, 
an audit occurs. Not only can this lead to legal issues, but it also can result 
in bad reporting and reflect a potential misuse of resources.
The potential for falsifying records can be offset by requiring an audit 
trail of all project activities, conducting periodic reviews of project docu-
mentation, and calling for an external review of all project documentation 
from an independent organization.
5.9  GENERAL ETHICAL DILEMMAS
The following list of ethical dilemmas is meant to be an overview of some 
of the ones that can occur throughout the entire life cycle of a project 
or during each of the major processes of initiating, planning, executing, 
monitoring and controlling, and closing. For simplification they have 
been grouped into one or more groups and, as before, can overlap with 
some of the others. The four groups are (1) people, or human resources; 
(2) process, or adherence to policies, procedures, laws, and regulations; 
(3) performance, or implementing the project; and (4) perception, or how 
actions are perceived by others external to the project.
5.9.1  People and Ethics
These ethical dilemmas are the most pervasive simply because they deal 
substantially with the people side of project management. They are more 
challenging and complex to resolve. They span across all five ethical cat-
egories and throughout all the project management processes and phases 
(Table 5.6).

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  131
5.9.1.1  Allowing a Toxic Culture to Exist
The atmosphere of a project often reflects the tone set by the overall organi-
zation. If the overall atmosphere is negative, then it will permeate the proj-
ect. Such an atmosphere can affect all aspects of a project from the way it 
does business to how it respects or reacts to given situations. Productivity, 
use of resources, and information quality all can lead to rework if affected. 
In some cases, the toxic culture can cause people to act in such a way that 
can legally put them and the greater organization at risk. It is an ethical 
dilemma because it can set a tone that encourages people to behave in 
ways that are unacceptable under normal circumstances.
About the best project managers can do in this situation is to adapt to 
the environment and follow their own ethical standards. The pressure can 
be immense, especially if people feel they are trapped and have to do what 
is necessary to survive. Project managers should follow their own con-
science and protect the team as much as possible to execute the project in 
the most effective and efficient manner possible.
5.9.1.2  Incivility
This involves how individuals treat those around them. It has much to 
do with how people are perceived on a project. Incivility can also exist 
among peers. Peers may elect to treat an individual or group of people 
with disrespect, based on race, religion, sex, ethnicity, and even personal-
ity. Incivility toward individuals will impact their performance in terms 
of achieving the goals and objectives of the project and also by lowering 
morale. It is an ethical dilemma because it affects the dignity and self-
respect of individuals.
Several actions can be taken to offset the ethical dilemma of incivil-
ity. Tasks can be assigned to prevent people who are uncivil toward each 
other from working together. The source of the problem can be addressed 
by having an open discussion to get the individuals to resolve their dif-
ferences. Individuals can be removed from the project. People can be 
required to take training courses on diversity, which covers everything 
from physical characteristic to thinking styles.

132  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
5.9.1.3  Harassment
This is an obvious example of an ethical dilemma. The point can be fur-
ther expanded to include harassment in general, which goes beyond the 
sexual dimension. Harassment can take the form of bullying on the job 
or verbal assault by a leader or a peer. It can impede a person’s ability to 
achieve the goals and objectives of the project as well as hinder optimum 
performance. Allowed to be taken to the extreme, harassment can lead to 
legal complications. It is an ethical dilemma because no one should come 
to work and experience a threatening environment.
Project managers can address this problem by analyzing their approach 
toward managing their project and by making changes to their manage-
ment style if necessary. It should be given attention early on if witnessed 
among stakeholders, and help should be sought from human resources or 
some other organization to intervene to discontinue the behavior.
5.9.1.4  Violation of Privacy
The right to privacy in the workplace is a very difficult dilemma in trying 
to determine when the rights of an organization can impact the rights of 
an individual. In some cases, the former has precedence over the latter, 
and vice versa. With computing technology and cell phones increasingly 
being used in the workplace, the line between organizations and individu-
als can be complicated despite the fact that the courts have generally ruled 
that there is a right to privacy. For instance, if team members believe their 
right to privacy has been violated, it can affect their efficiency and the 
effectiveness of their performance; it can also get the lawyers involved. It 
is an ethical dilemma because it affects individuals’ rights.
It is necessary to at least be conscious of this dynamic tension 
between the rights of the organization and the rights of the individual. 
If there is a question over the right to privacy, it is essential to find out 
the circumstances and the policies and procedures that should be fol-
lowed and to seek assistance from human resources on how to handle 
the situation.
5.9.1.5  Retaliation
Again, this one is very sensitive legally. A person may report that the proj-
ect is in trouble or that something else is occurring unethically on the 

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  133
project. Management or peers may seek to retaliate against the individual, 
resulting in a host of legal and nonlegal problems. Whistle-blowers fre-
quently face this problem in overt and subtle ways.
Project managers may not even be privy to the fact that the individ-
ual has filed a complaint, especially if the person goes through a hotline 
investigation. If they are, however, they need to report any retaliation that 
occurs. Of course, it goes without saying that they should avoid retaliating 
against an individual.
5.9.1.6  Coercion
Power comes in many forms, such as by virtue of position or personality. 
Using power to get people to do something, especially something illegal or 
unethical, that they would not ordinarily do is treading on dangerous ter-
ritory. Not only will it invite a person to seek payback, but it can also result 
in a person not wanting to participate later on the project and can lead to 
legal complications. It is an ethical issue because it violates the dignity of 
the individual.
Project managers should seek to influence behavior in a way that does 
not require coercion. Sometimes, pressure needs to be exerted to achieve 
results, but that does not mean they should be threatened in a way that 
violates their free will. Ways to avoid coercion is to apply participative 
management on the project, to engender accountability for results through 
the definition of roles, accountabilities, and authorities, and to construct 
responsibility assignment matrices.
5.9.1.7  No Respect for Values
This dilemma covers the values of the organization, the project, and the 
individual. All people have a set of culturally based values that help them 
to guide their lives. In a world of global projects, respecting values of other 
countries, organizations, and individuals is critical to getting people to per-
form efficiently and to achieve the goals and objectives of the project. Failure 
to respect these values can affect the overall performance of a project as well 
as alienate people. It is an ethical dilemma because it affects the dignity of 
the individual.
A special effort needs to be made to respect the different cultural values 
that exist in the project environment. The project manager may not agree 

134  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
with them but, unless they harm individuals, has an ethical obligation to 
respect them.
5.9.1.8  No Provision of Honest Feedback
A less polite way of describing this is lying. Honesty is the best way to pre-
serve credibility, and once a person loses that credibility it becomes next 
to impossible to regain it. Lying can occur in all life cycles, but it is most 
likely to arise during initiating and monitoring and controlling. However, 
at no time should it be allowed.
Project managers should set an example by not lying of course; they also 
need to confront it when others lie. They can help minimize the chance of 
lying by collecting and publishing reliable and frequent metrics about the 
performance of your project. They can also question remarks and assump-
tions made by individuals rather than allowing people to continue lying. 
This becomes even more challenging when a key, powerful stakeholder 
continues to lie, and everyone else knows otherwise.
5.9.1.9  Treat People Inequitably
People by their very nature will give preference to others for all sorts of 
reasons. They like their personality. They have the same heritage. They 
have the same physical characteristics. The challenge is when it interferes 
with treating people the same despite the differences. It can affect esprit de 
corps, causing people to underperform because they do not feel included. 
Individuals who feel they are treated inequitably will soon disengage 
themselves from the project, if not physically then mentally and emotion-
ally. It becomes an ethical issue because it is not employing resources as 
they were intended by the organization.
Project managers can prevent treating people inequitably by ensuring 
that everyone on the project has an opportunity to have a say in its direc-
tion and to participate in achieving its outcome. Tasks and responsibili-
ties also can be assigned that will encourage people to work together to 
develop deliverables.
5.9.1.10  Lack of Personal Responsibility
Everyone associated with the project should have a sense of personal 
responsibility for their share of work that contributes to the overall success 

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  135
of the project. Unfortunately, sometimes some individuals accept respon-
sibility for results that go well, and when things do not go well they shift 
the blame to someone else. If accepting a lack of responsibility prevails on 
a project, then it is likely to head toward disaster. People need to accept 
responsibility if for no other reason but to have a sense of ownership in 
the project.
People can be encouraged to accept results by offering opportunities to 
participate in the planning and execution of the project, assigning roles 
and responsibilities clearly, and following up on actions to occur now and 
in the future.
5.9.1.11  Spread of Malicious Rumors
Unsubstantiated rumors, especially negative ones, really serve no purpose. 
The negative ones can be especially devastating to the morale and productiv-
ity of a project. These negative rumors span everything from being outsourced 
to being forced to working overtime without compensation (depending on 
employment status, of course). Negative rumors serve no purpose other than 
to focus people’s minds on nonproductive work. Some rumors can be down-
right malicious in nature, impugning the reputation of an individual or an 
entire project team. The ethical consequences can be immense because they 
are not above the waterline and are difficult to address.
It is difficult to counter rumors because it is not easy to find the origi-
nator of the rumor and try to follow up on it. The best way to deal with 
rumors is to hold meetings with key stakeholders to confront them on the 
merits of the rumor and then to communicate their responses to the team. 
Facts and data can also be collected that either substantiate or counter the 
rumor and then the findings communicated. The important action is to 
address the rumor before it has harmful effects on the project.
5.9.1.12  Misuse of Power and Position
Power and position often go together, although in some cases they can be 
separate. When together they entice some people to allow themselves to 
be consumed by both. Project managers, while often not formal agents of 
an organization, can have power that spans the entire continuum from 
weak to strong, depending on the organizational structure of the parent 
organization. A person’s power, if strong and left unchecked, can lead 
to abuse of certain team members. This one has obvious ethical issues 

136  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
surrounding it. If project managers violate the rights of individuals they 
can land themselves and the organization in court. If they use power to 
influence reporting, then the information may provide an inaccurate view 
of what is happening. If they have too much power, project managers can 
misuse resources for personal use.
Project managers need to question whether they are violating the power 
and authority entrusted to them. The arrogance of power can be avoided 
by obtaining participation by key stakeholders throughout the life of a 
project and asking stakeholders for continuous feedback on performance.
5.9.1.13  Discrimination
Discrimination takes many forms, including age, height, color, and eth-
nicity. Despite all the laws and training on diversity, it continues without 
abatement. Just because individuals claim they do not discriminate does 
not mean they do not practice discrimination. To a large extent, learn-
ing not to discriminate is a combination of knowledge and awareness. 
Discrimination can be quite blatant, such as directly refusing to work 
with someone of a certain ethnicity, or subtle, such as deliberately not 
inviting someone to a project meeting because of their religion.
Discrimination by team members is serious business and happens more 
often than people might think. Discrimination should be addressed up 
front, not only because it is wrong and can have legal implications but also 
because it can kill team work, making the team less effective and efficient. 
It also allows the project’s most valuable resource, people, to be abused.
Discrimination can be prevented by encouraging greater team member 
interaction, which in turn fosters greater sharing of emotion and discus-
sion among different people. Diversity training can be offered. If it is a 
global project, people can be persuaded to learn about the culture of other 
people’s projects.
5.9.1.14  Encourage or Not Deal with Infighting
Divide and conquer is a common technique used in political and military 
environments. Encouraging and tolerating infighting is also common in 
the project environment. The larger the project in terms of stakeholders, 
generally the more chance there is for infighting to become quite com-
mon. Naturally, infighting, not to be confused with competition, can 
be quite counterproductive. Goals and objectives can slip because of it; 

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  137
rework can become the norm. Some team members find themselves so 
intimidated that they tune out and may not stop producing but no longer 
provide information.
Tolerating infighting is an ethical dilemma because it can lead to per-
forming unethical actions. One side does things, such as spread malicious 
lies or fails to deliver, in an effort to sabotage the other side. If project 
managers engage in the infighting, it also demonstrates their reluctance 
to encourage collaboration to achieve a common goal as well as destroys 
their credibility.
Infighting can be dealt with by first maintaining independence and cred-
ibility through not engaging in the infighting. The fighters can be encour-
aged to resolve their differences by applying conflict management and 
team-building exercises. If anything, the issue can be elevated to superiors.
5.9.1.15  Not Treat Everyone Fairly and Equitably
In social science there is the law of oligarchy, meaning that in every group 
a core team of elites will form. In time, these people receive most of the 
rewards and other benefits, while the rest share a lesser amount. In other 
words, they become more equal than others and receive preferential treat-
ment. This circumstance can have a negative impact on members of the 
team who are not part of the oligarchy, especially if the lion’s share of 
the perks goes to a small group of preferred people who do not deserve 
it; they may be less attentive to their work, resulting in rework, and may 
not bother to direct their energies to achieve the goals and objectives of 
the project.
People can be treated more equitably and fairly by giving them a 
fair opportunity to participate on the project by asking for volunteers. 
Everyone can be given a chance for exposure to other key stakeholders by 
allowing them to give presentations about some aspect of the project.
5.9.1.16  Not Stopping Hidden Agendas
This dilemma is difficult to identify and work on because by its very nature 
it is hard to uncover. Often hidden agendas manifest themselves by a person’s 
behavior that is exhibited negatively, such as disparaging comments about the 
process, certain people, and the quality of output, but it is done in such a way 
that the attack is indirect. Needless to say, this behavior can lower morale and 
cause a project to become stale, resulting in rework and not meeting goals and 

138  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
objectives in a timely manner. Information often appears confusing because 
it is difficult to ascertain what is true and what is false. It becomes an ethical 
issue if it is allowed to persist because people may operate on false information.
Hidden agendas can be addressed in several ways. The agendas can be 
called out in a meeting to uncover them and have others verify or dis-
credit the person’s exposed agenda. A private meeting can be held with 
the person to try to come up with a mutual resolution. The person can be 
removed from the project, thereby eliminating the hidden agenda.
5.9.1.17  Exploit People
Taking advantage of people for personal gain is wrong. Project managers 
who use people to gain the upper hand and take credit while not recogniz-
ing others is called exploitation. It is not the same as employing people to 
achieve the goals and objectives of the project, in which the focus is on the 
greater good. Exploiting simply misuses people, which in the end lowers 
performance and creates waste. It is unethical because in this case project 
managers put themselves first and the project second.
Project managers can overcome the temptation to exploit people and 
encourage others to do the same by always making decisions in the con-
text of achieving the goals and objectives of the project, reemphasizing 
the vision of the project at meetings, and always asking what is in the best 
interests of the project whenever conflict or an issue arises.
5.9.1.18  Deliberate Malicious Damage to Reputations
People who feel animosity or jealousy toward another person sometimes 
exhibit it by trashing the reputations of the individuals; they can do the 
same for organizations and projects. When these people do that, and 
sometimes they may have a legitimate reason to do so, they harm not only 
the person, project, or organization but also themselves. If the malicious 
damage goes too far, then it can result in legal complications.
Malicious damage to reputations needs to be taken on when it occurs. 
Not doing anything can be construed as acceptance or even concurrence. 
It can be dealt with by addressing the comments up front with the individ-
ual or even at a team meeting. Human resources can also get involved if it 
appears that the malicious damage has the potential to become a legal issue.

5.9.2  Process and Ethics
These ethical dilemmas affect primarily the ethical areas of compliance and 
accurate and timely information (Table 5.7). Many of them require mak-
ing objective decisions, a difficult act to perform when judgment may be 
impaired without realizing it through the use of rationalization.
5.9.2.1  Receiving Inappropriate Entertainment and Gifts
While common sense would tell people that this one involves ethical 
dilemmas, it happens all too often. Some individuals will receive gifts and

entertainment as if in denial that it can hinder their objectivity and inde-
pendence in making a decision or that no one really cares. Frequently, the 
ethical situation deteriorates or the transgression increases to the point 
that obvious action has to be taken; otherwise the project and the orga-
nization will see a negative impact on resources used on the project and 
lawyers start getting involved. In some cases, attempts are made to cover 
up the fact that this situation is occurring, which only leads to commis-
sion of further ethical situations and transgressions.
There are limited options for dealing with this situation. The standard 
can be set by not receiving inappropriate entertainment and gifts. Even 
the mere appearance of this ethical dilemma can cause harm; therefore, 
the standard can be set by avoiding any direct or indirect implication by 
stepping away. If it is a procurement organization, let it deal with vendors 
or suppliers during the negotiation process. As for people on the team, a 
process should be set up for reviewing all receipts. Of course, if something 
is happening after hours and the project manager suspects it, he or she can 
contact human resources or call a hotline if one exists.
5.9.2.2  Conflict of Interest with Vendors and Suppliers
This one is related to the previous ethical dilemma, except it is direct. The 
stakeholders may have investments or have worked previously with a ven-
dor or supplier and have assets with them. As with the previous one, this 
ethical situation can cloud individuals’ judgment whether they realize it 
or not. Even the mere appearance can cause problems. And like the previ-
ous one, it can lead to serious legal complications.
Project managers, of course, should extricate themselves from any circum-
stance that may be construed, directly or indirectly, as a conflict of interest. 
They should expect others on their team to do the same. Human resources 
should be contacted, or suspicions should be called in to a hotline if one exists.
5.9.2.3  Lacking Due Diligence and Due Care
Due diligence involves investigating the facts and data to confirm or dis-
confirm the existence of processes and procedures in an organization. 
From a project management perspective, in the context of this book, it is 
verifying that the key principles, tools, and techniques are implemented 
on a project. For example, the project has a charter, a work breakdown 

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  141
structure, schedule, and cost baselines. A failure to have such disciplines, 
tools, and techniques is representative of a lack of due diligence. Lack of 
due care is the follow-through in the implementation of such techniques, 
tools, and disciplines on a project. It is their actual application under what 
constitutes being reasonable under a given set of circumstances.
Sometimes, no due diligence exists. Sometimes due diligence exists but 
not due care. Of course, if no due diligence exists then there is likely no 
due care; the former can exist without the latter but not vice versa. In an 
age of litigation, the safe bet is to have both in place, especially with a 
project that can impact the financial existence of the firm and sharehold-
ers are watching it closely. Exercising due diligence without due care is an 
ethical situation or transgression because it misleads key decision makers 
in thinking that what was said is actually what will be done.
Several steps can be taken to ensure due diligence and due care. Project 
management processes and deliverables can be developed as advocated by 
professional institutions. The discipline on the project is then exercised to 
ensure that the processes and deliverables are actually realized through-
out the life cycle of a project.
5.9.2.4  Massaging Feedback
This dilemma involves posturing information in such a way that, when it is 
presented, it communicates a message that seems innocuous, when in fact 
the situation may be far worse than anyone realized. For example, some 
companies use a color code for status, such as red, green, and yellow for 
either one or more of the following categories: cost, schedule, quality, and 
risk. Amazingly, some project managers may be red in all categories, but 
when they give a summary report they report themselves as green. If they 
want to hedge their bets, they will report themselves as yellow. On large 
organizations and projects, this circumstance is quite common, especially 
when the number of reviewers increases. Project managers and other key 
stakeholders who massage feedback are doing themselves and key decision 
makers a disservice. They are not communicating an accurate portrayal on 
the status of their projects, which can lead to bad decisions as well as a lack 
of credibility.
Massaging of information can be prevented in several ways. If the proj-
ect is not highly proprietary, everyone can be given free access to data 
about the project. Stakeholders, especially outside experts, can review 

142  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
for validity and reliability, the quality of the data, and the information for 
reports. High personal and professional standards can be exercised, and 
the status of the project can be reported on accurately.
5.9.2.5  Unequal Access to Key Information and Other Resources
Although most project management experts advocate the open shar-
ing of information and other resources among team members and other 
stakeholders to get the job done, what often happens is that the iron law of 
oligarchy goes into effect. A few people have access to the resources (e.g., 
people, information, equipment, supplies), and the others find themselves 
searching and going without what they need. The result is people often wast-
ing their time and effort by doing their work in a way that could have been 
done more efficiently if they had the resources to do their job. They may also 
have to perform rework, failing to achieve what they need, or having other 
people do their work. They may even lack reliable information to do their job 
because no one shared information about what they needed to know.
All project resources can be reviewed, and processes and procedures 
can be set up for people to access the resources that they need. If certain 
resources need to be managed or controlled, then these processes and pro-
cedures should be shared with everyone on the project—communicated to 
everyone instead of everyone operating out of ignorance. Common work 
areas can be constructed that enable people to access what they need to 
do their job. If people work virtually, they should have a single point of 
contact to get what they need to do their job.
5.9.2.6  Engaging in Illicit Activities
This dilemma involves activities like embezzlement, industrial espionage, 
etc. which, for most people, are construed as unethical. They entail seri-
ous violation of laws and regulations as well as not following policies and 
procedures. They can also involve any stakeholder on a project.
Such ethical dilemmas cannot be prevented from happening, but it can 
be ensured that all activities on the project comply with relevant organiza-
tional policies and procedures as well as laws and regulations. Of course, if 
anyone on the project becomes aware of the potential or real occurrence of 
illicit activities, report it immediately to the appropriate channels offered 
within the company or to the government if necessary.

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  143
5.9.2.7  Not Reporting Unethical Behavior
Doing nothing when witnessing something that is not right is funda-
mentally wrong; a person becomes complicit with the wrongful behavior 
whether or not they realize it. On a project, an unethical activity, especially 
one of wrongful intent, must be addressed—despite the consequences. 
While many people agree with that statement, a much fewer number of 
people actually exercise that notion. If the opposite existed, there would 
likely be more whistle-blowers. Failure to report puts the individual, proj-
ect, and the organization at risk.
Project managers are responsible for ensuring that all ethical dilemmas 
are dealt with, the more serious ones being reported to the appropriate 
people or entities. They also must work to guarantee that all the efforts 
of the project comply with laws, regulations, processes, and procedures 
related to unethical situations and transgressions.
5.9.3  Performance and Ethics
These ethical dilemmas are strongly interrelated with dealing with sen-
sitive people issues (Table 5.8) that can turn into major problems if not 
addressed right away.
5.9.3.1  Revealing Privileged Information
Information, as mentioned earlier, is vital to the success of an organiza-
tion. It should be treated as a valuable asset and should receive the same 
treatment as a project involving a partnership with another company if 
there is one. In other words, it should be treated like gold. Some people

unfortunately talk too much, especially in a public forum, revealing infor-
mation that even key stakeholders do not know anything about. Such reck-
less behavior can result in a loss of valuable information to competitors and 
may lead to litigation by parties injured by the revelation.
Everyone on the team should follow the policies and procedures related 
to privileged information. In some cases, compliance with any laws and 
regulations should be guaranteed. It also may be necessary to identify 
and protect information that is deemed critical to the project as well as 
prevent open discussions on certain topics in the presence of people who 
do not need to know.
5.9.3.2  Not Confronting Problems Up Front
Not all problems are ethical in nature, but the failure to address a serious 
problem is an ethical dilemma. Allowing a serious problem to exist under 
the radar while knowing it exists is representative of a lack of due diligence 
as well as a failure in exercising professional responsibilities as a project 
manager. Some project managers and other stakeholders, however, like to 
pretend something never happened and believe that addressing it in some 
way is an admission of an ethical failure.
Confronting problems up front can be encouraged in several ways. An 
atmosphere of trust can be engendered by encouraging open discussion 
and sharing of information. Issues can be brought up at team meetings 
and other sessions to maintain awareness of problems and even to come 
up with solutions. Metrics can be implemented and one-on-one or group 
sessions held regularly to identify and solve problems.
5.9.4  Perception and Ethics
These ethical dilemmas may have the appearance of being unethical. In 
actuality, they may not be issues at all but require further investigation to 
determine if there is some substance behind them (Table 5.9).
5.9.4.1  Deception
This one is essentially faking it. It is tied closely with massaging feed-
back and lying. Often, the lines among these three and others are blurred. 
Deception is giving the impression of one thing while doing another. The 
intent, in other words, is to lead people astray. Some people can do this very 

How Ethics Permeates the Entire Project Life Cycle  •  145
skillfully almost to the point of being a master propagandist; they tell only 
one side of a story but portray it all in such a way that others think they are 
getting the whole story. Unfortunately, such behavior can lead to people 
seeking legal action because they were misled. It also kills credibility.
Several actions can be taken to minimize the occurrence and impact 
of deception. All data and information about a project can be reviewed 
separately by two or more people. Metrics can be put in place and data 
scrubbed prior to calculating them. At meetings, people can be encour-
aged to act as a devil’s advocate to challenge insights, comments, and ideas 
that seem to prevail.
5.9.4.2  Not Emphasizing the Overall Interests of a Project
All projects serve a purpose; all efforts should be directed toward satisfy-
ing the reason for its existence. If other people gain from its success, then 
all the better. However, sometimes people—including the project man-
ager—think that the project exists solely to serve their needs and at the 
expense of the project itself. When the needs of the project are overrid-
den by the needs of individuals, then collaboration becomes difficult if 
not impossible. Project performance begins to suffer as people jockey for 
advantage, and the entire project becomes politicized. Rework and missed 
goals and objectives are just some of the results when stakeholders do not 
emphasize the overall interests of a project.

146  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
Certain actions can be taken to discourage and perhaps prevent deem-
phasizing the overall interests of a project. When an issue or problem 
arises, team members can be encouraged to look at the big picture first. 
The purpose, goals, and objectives of the project can be reviewed at the 
beginning of all meetings. When issues and problems do arise, the impact 
of the purpose, goals, and objectives on the project can be described.
5.9.4.3  Deliberately Attempting to Damage Company 
Reputation and Product Image
Some people just have it out for the organization or project that they sup-
port. They may not have wanted to participate in it but have no other 
choice. They may not like the people or the management they work with. 
They may have been passed over for a promotion or a pay raise. Whatever 
the reason, they will do what they can to seek redress or payback. Not 
surprisingly, they may create or foment ethical dilemmas just to have the 
sweet taste of vengeance or revenge.
Not much can be done to prevent a deliberate attempt to damage com-
pany reputation and product image. About the best project managers can 
do is be aware of stakeholders who might take action and be careful what 
data, information, and other resources are entrusted to them.
5.10  FINAL THOUGHTS
In this chapter, a large number of ethical dilemmas were presented. Many 
of these are interrelated, meaning that they overlap in their purpose and 
effects. Some of them do not appear as ethical dilemmas but have serious 
ethical impacts. Others are so blatant as ethical dilemmas that it boggles 
the imagination that they exist, yet they occur more often than people 
like to think. Many of them happen, too, not by design but by accident. 
Whether by design or accident, they have to be addressed, of course. But 
project managers also need to uncover the intent. If an ethical situation 
or transgression arises because one or more people intended it to happen, 
then the response must take on a higher degree of intensity.

Ethics and Project Governance
In the ideal world, everyone is ethical. There is no need for oversights, sig-
natures of approval, cross-checking, or separating duties because everyone 
does the “right thing.” Unfortunately, that ideal does not exist; Shangri-La 
remains a dream. That, of course, does not mean that people as a general 
rule are unethical; it indicates that once in awhile persons with unethical 
intentions can join the team, creating an environment that demands effec-
tive governance disciplines for a project.
6.1  WHAT IS GOVERNANCE?
The idea of governance on a project is a relatively new concept often associ-
ated with much larger organizations. Few people think of it as part of proj-
ect management, but it is very important, for without it a project becomes 
nothing more than an unfocused group that achieves very little over time 
and consumes more resources than are necessary.
Governance is identifying and implementing the policies, processes, 
procedures, tools, and techniques for achieving specific goals and objec-
tives. These policies and procedures are often associated with efficiency 
and effectiveness, in terms of achieving goals and objectives with the least 
amount of waste or at minimal cost. Some of the more well-known goals 
and objectives are maximizing benefits and minimizing costs, providing 
business value, setting and meeting customer expectations, adding struc-
ture to ensure better predictability of performance, ensuring improved 
quality of output, meeting expectations, resolving conflict, and balancing 

152  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
short- and long-term perspectives when considering the relationship of 
cost, schedule, quality, scope, and risk. Rarely, if ever, is there any emphasis 
on ensuring ethical performance of the stakeholders or at least laying the 
groundwork for increasing the likelihood of ethical behavior. Every effort 
should be made to minimize the probability of unethical activities.
It is safe to say, therefore, that good governance on a project consists 
of applying good project management disciplines that enable successful 
completion of a project, depending on what the criteria for success is. 
Ethics plays an important role in the effective application of these dis-
ciplines. The reason is simple: Unethical decisions and actions affect the 
quality of the output of those disciplines, much like bad data generate 
unreliable information. Therefore, ethics cannot be divorced from proj-
ect management.
Take the following example. A customer wants a new information sys-
tem developed. To win the contract, the vendor commits to an unrealistic 
schedule and budget with the anticipation that this will lead to more work 
in the future through work orders and enhancements. Both parties sign 
a contract and then a charter with the vendor knowing all too well that 
the parameters for the project are unrealistic. The plans, all predicated on 
an unrealistic contract, charter, and scope of work, will eventually lead to 
failure. The customer, out of ignorance, agrees to a series of work orders 
that overrun the budget and slips major milestones. Reporting through-
out the project contains unreliable data that generate poor information, 
leading to bad decisions. In the end, the customer ends up paying for a 
system that does not meet expectations, principally because of the unethi-
cal behavior of the vendor.
Instituting governance on projects is not easy. One reason is that gover-
nance is construed as instituting control, and to some extent that is true. 
However, governance also provides structure so that more is done with 
a minimal amount of waste. Still, some people fear governance think-
ing it might constrain them. Another reason is that people disagree as 
to how much governance is necessary on a project. Often, the amount of 
governance depends on the culture of the overall organization and what 
it views as sufficient breadth and depth being implemented. Still another 
reason, and tied to the last point, is that governance means something 
different for each stakeholder. Some will view it as following a rigid meth-
odology, whereas others see it as simply providing a guideline on what 
to do.

Ethics and Project Governance  •  153
6.2  WHAT ARE CONTROLS?
Basically, controls help to address five concerns:
	
1.	Compliance involves adherence to policies, procedures, laws, and 
regulations.
	
2.	Effectiveness involves ensuring the achievement of goals and objectives.
	
3.	Accurate and timely information involves ensuring that the right 
people get the right information of the right amount in the right for-
mat at the right time
	
4.	Efficiency involves ensuring that resources are used in a manner that 
reduces waste.
	
5.	Protection of resources involves ensuring physical and logical safe-
keeping of the project’s resources.
A control is a measure put in place to protect the project from threats, 
such as an ethical issue or transgression. A failure in the effectiveness of 
a control is one where it does not effectively protect a project, in this case 
from an ethical issue or violation. Project managers can employ three 
types of controls to ensure all five categories increase the likelihood of 
ethical behavior on a project: (1) preventive; (2) detective; and (3) correc-
tive. Preventive controls take effect before a threat, such as an ethical issue 
or transgression, occurs. Often they entail putting strategies in place to 
deal with offsets or to deter their occurrence. Detective controls reveal a 
threat, such as an ethical issue or transgression, has occurred and report 
it to the appropriate people. Corrective controls require taking action to 
rectify the situation and ensure that circumstances get back to normal. 
Controls can fit one or more categories, depending on their application; 
they are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
Table  6.1 contains a list of common controls that could be used to 
address a wide range of ethical threats, issues, and transgressions.
6.3  WHAT IS RISK?
A risk represents a potential vulnerability to a system, whether auto-
mated or manual. A threat is a risk that is applicable to a project based on

probability and impact. Controls can be put in place to reduce the impact 
of a threat. In some cases, threats can be prevented or mitigated should 
they occur; in other cases, a decision may be made to accept the event 
(a realized threat) because the impact is inconsequential. Projects can face 
a wide range of ethical dilemmas, and the project manager needs to be 
able to apply an appropriate strategy to deal with them should the threats 
become realized.
An important distinction between a risk and an issue needs to be made 
at this point. A risk is something that could occur in the future; for exam-
ple, an unethical risk may be when a stakeholder might release proprietary 
information to the public. An issue is something that exists now and is 
consequently no longer a risk; for example, an unethical issue is a stake-
holder who has already released proprietary information to the public. 
Ideally, as many risks as possible should be identified and strategies put in 
place to deal with them if they should arise, or action should be taken in 
advance to deal with them should they become an issue.

6.4  EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT
Although risks, threats, or issues on projects cannot be eliminated, the 
likelihood of their occurrence and impact can be reduced by taking sev-
eral actions.
One, exercise due diligence and due care regarding ethical issues and 
transgressions. Due diligence is putting the necessary measures in place 
to decrease the likelihood of a risk occurring and, if it does, minimize its 
impact. Due care is actually implementing what was identified and devel-
oped under due diligence. It makes little sense to identify and develop 
policies, processes, procedures, tools, and techniques if they are not going 
to be actually implemented.
Two, if an ethical risk, threat, or issue does arise, determine whether 
the controls in place have managed to eliminate or mitigate the impact. 
If an ethical threat has occurred, it is necessary to know if the controls 
worked to prevent it from having a negative effect on the project and the 
organization and also so that a project of a similar nature has an idea of 
the effectiveness of the control.
Three, if an ethical issue or transgression does arise, determine the 
intent behind its occurrence. Many ethical issues and transgressions arise 
out of ignorance rather than intent. The degree of intention and their cor-
responding impacts will determine the breadth and depth of control being 
exercised.
Four, perform a risk assessment for the project. This should include 
looking at the ethical risks to the project. These risks are often overlooked 
and are partly why some projects and companies find themselves dealing 
with them in a reactive rather proactive mode. The risk assessment enables 
the likelihood or probability and impact of a risk to be determined and the 
appropriate preventive, detective, or corrective controls to be in place to 
deal with it.
Five, look at the context of the project. The context can tell quite a bit 
about the ethical threats facing the project, the likelihood, and the impact. 
Some of the contextual factors to consider include the tone at the top of an 
organization, market conditions, financial state of the economy, previous 
history of an organization dealing with ethical issues and transgressions, 
relationship among key stakeholders, and the amount of time and other 
resources needed to complete a project.

Ethics and Project Governance  •  157
Six, revisit the risk assessment from time to time. The context of a proj-
ect changes over time, and what seemed significant from an ethical stand-
point at one time may no longer be so. Stakeholders change, the scope 
changes, and other factors like the economy can all change, sometimes 
overnight. That’s why you should revisit the risk assessment on a regular 
basis or when something changes.
Seven, when revisiting a risk assessment, be sure also to look at the effec-
tiveness of existing controls vis-à-vis risks. It may become apparent that 
certain controls are no longer useful and therefore need to be replaced. Or 
additional controls may need to be instituted to strengthen the existing 
ones. In addition, if a control was implemented to address a risk it may have 
created another risk requiring additional risk management.
Eight, maintain objectivity and independence when conducting a risk 
assessment as it relates to ethical issues and transgressions. Allowing room 
for prejudices leads to out-of-control circumstances. The danger is looking 
for confirmation of decisions and actions, which can lead to cloudy judg-
ment. Bias and overconfidence can be a killer in decision making.
Nine, consider establishing some type of heuristic, or rule of thumb, for 
determining materiality for a control weakness, such as an ethical issue or 
transgression. Determining materiality is relatively easy when something is 
quantifiable, such as exceeding a cost threshold of 10 percent. The challenge 
is when something occurs that is more qualitative in nature, such as a large 
number of complaints from team members. Yet materiality enables a deter-
mination to be made of how significant a threat is if and when it occurs and 
the extent of the response to address it. That’s where judgment becomes 
important as well as the data and information that go into it. If there is any 
doubt as to what extent the response should be to a risk, consider both the 
likelihood and the impact and then exercise the prudent man rule, which 
basically states what a reasonable person would do in a specific situation.
Ten, recognize that no matter how well a risk assessment is performed 
that ethical risks or any other type of risk can never be eliminated from 
a project. Project managers can deal only with what they know might 
happen, and that depends on a limited amount of information. In addi-
tion, the information that is known is constantly changing in quality and 
quantity. Ethical issues and transgressions will arise no matter how many 
attempts are made to identify and prepare for them.
Finally, when the risk assessment is performed from an ethical perspec-
tive, identify the following for each ethical issue:

158  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
•	 Description
•	 Likelihood or probability of occurrence
•	 Impact
•	 Potential preventive, detective, and corrective controls
•	 Risk ownership
Of course, the risk assessment should be reviewed with key stakeholders 
on a periodic basis. The context of the project will likely change; conse-
quently, the risks will too as well as the attributes of the existing ones.
6.5  FINAL THOUGHTS
Governance on projects demonstrates due diligence and due care, two 
important actions for minimizing the chance of an ethical situation or trans-
gression occurring. Risk management is a key tool for demonstrating both. 
While risk management cannot eliminate all risks, it does help preclude the 
occurrence of known threats and, if they do occur, enables project managers 
to deal with them in a way that eradicates or minimizes their impact.

Ethics and the Law
Ethics is often erroneously confused with compliance with the law. In 
reality, ethics is much broader than the law. In this chapter, however, the 
focus is on compliance with the law.
Ethics and law seem tightly intertwined for obvious reasons. Violation of 
laws related to ethics can lead to fines and penalties for organizations and 
individuals, can end in debarment, or can cause a public relations disaster. 
Ethical situations and transgressions that do not involve the law, more 
often than not, are dealt with in a much quieter way. The legal penalties 
for violations are often substantial and, consequently, demand, immedi-
ate attention.
7.1  THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LAW AND ETHICS
It behooves organizations, and in some instances individuals, to keep the 
following guidelines in mind when considering ethics and the law.
First, recognize that compliance includes more than the law—for exam-
ple, adhering to policies, procedures, and methodologies of an organization. 
Most organizations circle around compliance with the law, but not always. 
For example, compliance with a methodology may not involve compliance 
with the law but may require compliance with management direction or a 
specific contract with a customer.
Second, recognize that compliance is not passive; it is very active. 
Organizations, at all levels, must make a concerted effort to demonstrate 
compliance with the law. The absence of an ethical situation or trans-
gression does not mean compliance with the law. More often than not, 
compliance with the law must be demonstrated, meaning exercising 
such concepts as due diligence and due care. For example, tests should be 

164  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
administered to ensure compliance with quality standards dictated by the 
law; it cannot be assumed that compliance will just happen.
Third, understand that noncompliance requires taking corrective 
action. Failure to comply, especially if awareness of its existence occurs 
and nothing is done, can result in stiff penalties both for the organization 
and the individuals involved. For example, it is dangerous to assume that 
a serious violation of a law on the project will go away simply by ignoring 
it or hoping that no one says anything to be absolved of responsibility.
Fourth, have a good understanding of any applicable laws, but do not act 
as an attorney. Project managers manage projects; that is their expertise. 
Unless they have a strong legal background or are an attorney, they should 
rely on experts to help with questions regarding the law. Oftentimes, the 
law can be vague and convoluted, and interpreting without the expertise 
can have dire consequences for the organization and involved individuals. 
For example, export laws can be very complex and the company’s attorney 
can help interpret them.
Fifth, realize that compliance does not stop unethical behavior; it sim-
ply minimizes the probability of occurrence. Just because a law exists 
and an organization embraces the law does not mean people on the team 
or the parent organization are obeying it. Compliance requires ongoing 
awareness and, in some cases, continuous monitoring. For example, it 
makes good sense to have an idea of what laws apply to the project and 
to revisit them during the course of the project to determine the degree 
of compliance.
Sixth, recognize that noncompliance can result from internal and exter-
nal circumstances. For example, partnerships and other strategic alliances 
in which the project may be involved do not necessarily exempt individu-
als or the project from responsibility for compliance; a close working rela-
tionship could lead to legal complications without anyone realizing it.
Seventh, be aware of the ethical laws applicable to the project and have 
a good understanding of the content and scope of those laws. When it 
comes to compliance, knowledge is the best protection. Again, when 
in doubt, contact the experts. For example, large companies especially 
have procurement specialists, lawyers, and contract specialists available 
for consultation.
Eighth, do not let current conduct and custom be a substitute for com-
pliance with the law. Conduct and custom are good guides, but both may 
be tolerating noncompliance. For example, what may be customary in 
China or Italy may not be legal according to the home country’s laws.

Ethics and the Law  •  165
Ninth, don’t gamble with obeying the law by calculating the acceptable 
loss or threshold in terms of fines, because fines are only one part of the 
equation. There is also the potential for debarment, imprisonment, and a 
tarnished reputation, which are incalculable and can go way beyond the 
purview and time frame of the project.
Tenth, corporate social responsibility dictates that individuals and the 
project comply with the law. Some companies have considerable eco-
nomic, social, and political power that can impact society in many ways. 
Failure to comply with relevant laws can result in negative consequences 
that go beyond the law. The same applies to a large project or program. 
Knowingly, and sometimes unknowingly, violating the law can harm 
people, their trust, and the organization’s credibility as an institution. For 
example, a blatant violation of hazmat laws not only has legal ramifica-
tions but also can cause physical and emotional problems.
It is a fact of life in business that the laws originate from many different 
jurisdictions. In the United States, businesses must follow federal law orig-
inating not just from congress but also from many branches and agencies 
in the United States. Some of these agencies are semiprivate, while others 
are public. Here is a sample list of agencies and other entities at the federal 
level that you or your organization may have to deal with and comply with 
their regulations:
•	 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives
•	 Bureau of Industry and Security
•	 Commodity Credit Corporation
•	 Council on Environmental Quality
•	 Customs and Border Protection
•	 Department of Commerce
•	 Department of Treasury
•	 Directorate of Defense Trade Controls
•	 Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
•	 Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council
•	 Food and Drug Administration
•	 International Trade Administration
•	 National Labor Relations Board
•	 Occupational Health and Safety Administration
•	 Office of Federal Procurement Policy
•	 Office of Government Standards
•	 Overseas Private Investment Corporation

166  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
•	 Securities and Exchange Commission
•	 U.S. Customs Service
•	 U.S. Export-Import Bank
•	 U.S. Federal Trade Commission
•	 U.S. Trade Representative
In addition to the federal institutions, a wide of array of laws exist at the 
state and local levels as well as in other countries and within specific juris-
dictions for each one. As if that is not enough, businesses may have to follow 
international guidelines and rules, some of which may be public or private:
•	 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
•	 Caux Round Table Business Principles of Ethics
•	 Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention
•	 European Union (EU)
•	 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
•	 International Monetary Fund (IMF)
•	 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
•	 Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
•	 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
•	 United Nations Convention on Contracts for International Sale of 
Goods (CISG)
•	 World Trade Organization (WTO)
The bottom line is that it is necessary to know, based on the scope of the 
project, at least what laws apply to the project and then to become familiar 
with them. If there are questions or doubts, check with the appropriate 
legal experts.
7.2  KEY LEGAL TERMS
While it may not be necessary to know all the laws, it is prudent to be familiar 
with some basic legal terms and principles as discussed from the perspective 
of American jurisprudence. What follows is a brief description of some of 
the key legal terms that are often used on a project. These terms were selected

Here are some legal principles and concepts to keep in mind as they 
relate to ethics and the law from the perspective of project management. 
These can help you avoid trouble.
First, recognize that all projects have a time of performance, mean-
ing that projects start and finish within an agreed on time frame. This 
time of performance is often reflected in a contract and a charter, and in 
some cases, particularly with external customers, penalty payments are 
imposed for late delivery. All project plans should be predicated on meet-
ing this timeline. A good practice, of course, is to look at all the options to 
determine the best approach to meet the timeline.
Second, understand that they involve some indication of an adequacy 
of performance, meaning that the project management and products or 
services must meet certain minimum standards. Failure to meet those 
minimum standards will impact the quality of output, possibly resulting 
in a legal violation, with the contract or governmental standards. Project 
managers should work closely with their legal, procurement, and qual-
ity organizations to help them ascertain ways to ensure compliance with 
adequacy of performance on their projects.
Third, establish and maintain an audit trail of the work performed, 
which serves as evidence of due diligence and due care, both important 
in case litigation arises. It also enables taking the appropriate corrective 
action if there is a violation of law. Some stakeholders believe that an audit 
trail will simply put their projects and parent organization in a legal mess 
should noncompliance occur. In reality, a lack of an audit trail raises red 
flags as an indicator that a failure to comply with a contract or a certain 
law occurred and, therefore, may warrant further investigation. On some 
projects, especially those related to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the fed-
eral government, a mere lack of an audit trail is a noncompliant action 
with the law.
Fourth, be aware of potential areas of fraud. While you don’t need to 
go looking for them, keep in mind some of the indicators of fraud, such 
as people under personal financial pressure or experiencing stress or 
other personal problems (e.g., drugs), excessive travel, and entertainment 
expenses of individuals seeking reimbursement by the project or com-
pany. These are known as red flags. Fraud has become a topic of interest 

170  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
lately because of the magnitude of its occurrence. Because of it, compa-
nies and their leadership have been destroyed. The misperception is that 
fraud matters and occurs only with senior stakeholders; the reality is that 
it occurs at all levels.
Fifth, control access to critical or privileged information. This control 
should cover proprietary, secrets, and personal identifiable information. 
Information should be provided on a need-to-know basis; failure to pro-
tect critical or privileged information can have a host of consequences to 
the project manager, to other people, and especially to others impacted 
by the release. This control has become much more difficult in today’s 
environment with the rise of thumb drives, CD/DVD burners, and logs, 
making difficult the job of controlling access. It is imperative, therefore, 
that project managers make every effort to comply with the law if for no 
other reason than to protect themselves and their organization should an 
unauthorized release of data and information occur.
Sixth, apply project management disciplines and techniques to the proj-
ect as a demonstration of due diligence and due care. In some areas, proj-
ect management disciplines are viewed as being bureaucratic. For internal 
projects, that attitude may be permissible, but for commercial contracts, 
especially those of a high financial amount that could sink a company 
by failing, such an approach is wrought with danger. In this case, angry 
shareholders will likely want to recover their losses and seek vengeance in 
other ways (e.g., termination of key stakeholders).
Seventh, provide oversight of suppliers and contractors related to the 
project. They are members of the team. While all the legal protections may 
be in place, the reality is that if some major compliance problem exists and 
it is committed by the suppliers or contractors, the likelihood is good that 
the buyer (in your case) will be construed, whether in actuality or appear-
ance, as being involved in the noncompliance incident. If your company is 
the one with the big name that everyone knows and the vendor or contrac-
tor is not, the firm’s reputation will be tarnished.
Eighth, be aware of the dangers associated with receiving gifts and other 
favors from vendors. Simple gifts of what may seem of minimal value 
can give the appearance of a conflict of interest. These gifts need to be 
approved in advance, especially if they involve a certain threshold value. 
Going out to dinner or on a joint golf outing can be construed as a conflict 
of interest, at least during the course of the project. The fundamental ques-
tion, of course, is who pays for what?

Ethics and the Law  •  171
Ninth, conduct a good risk assessment. This action will enable identify-
ing the key risks that could impact a project. One of the major results is 
identifying risks, some of which may be legal ones that have a high impact 
to a project. Knowing what those risks are will enable the project manager 
to determine the appropriate level of disciplines to ensure compliance. A 
risk assessment will enable determining the material impact of a breach 
with a specific law.
Tenth, know the contract for the project. While it is not necessary to be a 
lawyer or a contract administrator, it is a good practice to know the terms 
and conditions of the contract. This knowledge ensures that team member 
actions do not violate the terms and conditions. A simple decision that 
may at first make reasonable sense to move a project forward can possibly 
mean that certain terms and conditions had been violated. For example, 
the project manager or team members violate the principle of privity and 
bypass the prime contractor and manage the subcontractor directly.
Eleventh, understand that few, if any, projects operate in a legal “bubble,” 
meaning that the tentacles of the law stretch far into most organizations 
today. For example, many laws that deal with the relationships among 
employees (e.g., harassment, workplace safety, labor contracts) can easily 
be violated without ever realizing it. Having a good knowledge of such 
laws can help preclude noncompliance from becoming a major legal issue. 
At least when something does occur, appropriate action can be taken to 
become compliant with the law.
Twelfth, apply the proper exercise of authority. Too many times, espe-
cially project managers without much practical experience and knowl-
edge, think that as a project manager they have complete control to make 
decisions and act in a way that borders on authoritarianism. Such behav-
ior not only reflects a lack of maturity but can also put a project in danger-
ous legal problems. For example, project managers may make a decision to 
commit an organization to procurement contract when they may not have 
the authority to do so.
Thirteenth, comply with all internal and external audits and investiga-
tions. While that makes common sense, it does not always happen, espe-
cially if certain stakeholders—including the project manager—lack the 
confidence that they are in compliance with the law regarding a certain 
issue. When requested to provide information, cooperation is essential; 
otherwise, it could raise red flags and be construed as lying or hiding facts 
and data regarding a noncompliance issue.

172  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
Fourteenth, apply effective controls on a project, especially if they are 
related to compliance. Putting in good project management disciplines is 
a good start, but that may not be enough to ensure compliance with appli-
cable laws. It may be necessary to determine additional controls. There are 
essentially three types of controls: (1) preventive controls, which are insti-
tuted to minimize the probability and impact of something going awry, 
such as implementing segregation of duties; (2) detective controls, which 
indicate that something has happened, such as a report indicating that a 
certain threshold is being reached could be construed as a potential legal 
violation; and (3) corrective controls, which involve actions that are taken 
to fix any identified variance to policy, procedure, or law (i.e., the goal is to 
get back in compliance).
Finally, don’t become a “latrine lawyer.” In other words, don’t take the 
law in your own hands. Just because people are project managers does not 
mean that they know everything including all the laws. Too many stake-
holders confuse familiarity with expertise in regards to legal interpreta-
tion. It is good practice to become familiar with laws, but when it comes to 
legal interpretation it is best to consult the organization’s legal or contracts 
staff for guidance.
7.4  NUMEROUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS
Project managers may find that they have to comply with a wide range of U.S. 
laws, depending on the purpose and scope of their projects. Following is a 
description of some of the more common laws. It is not meant to be exhaus-
tive. These laws and regulations also may or may not apply to every project.
The laws can be grouped into categories. While these categories over-
lap like Venn diagrams, there are essentially (1) general, (2) environmen-
tal, (3) financial, (4) labor, (5) procurement, (6) international trade, and 
(7) information technology and security.
General laws and regulations deal with the relations among govern-
ments and businesses either under normal or emergency circumstances. 
They span a wide range of topics from the environment to finance.

7.5  FINAL THOUGHTS
While compliance is just one consideration of many other topics concern-
ing ethics, it is an important one because of the financial and legal conse-
quences. Project managers need to determine to what extent their projects 
require legal compliance; failure to do so will put themselves and their 
organization at risk. Having a good knowledge of the governmental insti-
tutions, related nongovernmental organizations, methodologies, and legal 
terminology can help them respond to ethical issues and transgressions 
as they arise.

Ethics, Globalization, 
and Project Management
The world of project management has changed in many respects. Projects 
are often no longer isolated events but rather a significant part of a com-
pany’s success or failure, not just on a local level but an international level, 
too. Many projects now have a global dimension to them that also makes 
ethics a complicated concern for stakeholders on a project. Globalization 
in this context means that there is considerable integration among a wide 
number of people, processes, systems, and data that transcends national 
boundaries to generate a profit for a company.
8.1  IMPORTANT FACTORS
The relationship among project management, globalization, and ethics is 
complicated because of a number of factors:
•	 The competition has become more numerous, not just from other 
companies but from other countries.
•	 The time to market has accelerated. The company that delivers the earli-
est has the advantage of meeting customer needs and beating copycats.
•	 Quality has increased; many international companies adopt Six 
Sigma to deliver products and results that reduce rework and satisfy 
the needs of the customer.
•	 The development costs must drop to stay competitive, putting pres-
sure to deliver at lower cost.
•	 On top of all that, pressure grows to increase shareholder value to 
ensure sufficient returns to investors.

188  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
Translated, all of this means that project managers must deliver faster, 
better, and cheaper. This pressure paves the way for ethical dilemmas in a 
global environment.
8.2  KEY DIMENSIONS
A project manager must consider several overlapping dimensions when 
working on international projects that can influence what is considered an 
ethical issue or transgression (Figure 8.1):
	
1.	Sociological dimension of international projects: This dimension deals 
with topics like cultural aspects, such as religious holidays, beliefs 
and values, management and working styles, business and social 
protocols, perceptions of time, quality of life, risk and uncertainty, 
and perceptions of time and space.
	
2.	Political and legal dimension: This pertains to the governing institu-
tions of a society: This dimension deals with topics like law, regu-
lations, political participation, and others principally centered on 
International
Dimensions
Geographical
Infrastructure
Political
and
Legal
Economic
Sociological
FIGURE 8.1

Ethics, Globalization, and Project Management  •  189
the role of government; how it relates to internal constituencies and 
external parties; perceptions of ownership of enterprises and profits; 
government bureaucracy; and local acceptance of foreign powers.
	
3.	Economic dimension: This pertains to topics like currency valuation, 
payments, supply and demand, perceptions about profit making and 
sharing, and foreign supplier relationships. Like the political dimen-
sion, this one is often dynamic, changing constantly.
	
4.	Infrastructure dimension: This deals with technology, science, engi-
neering, and others. This dimension deals with topics like the tech-
nological capacity of a country to support a project, standardization 
of tools and processes, information sharing, and technical profi-
ciency and currency.
	
5.	Geographical dimension: This requires considering the international, 
regional, and local factors when managing a project. Generally, the 
greater the geographical spread between the home for the project 
and the one for where the work is, the more difficult it is to manage, 
especially if the culture and technology varies from one location and 
the other. This dimension deals with topics like distance, time zones, 
and communication.
8.3  INDEPENDENCE, INTEGRATION, 
AND INTERDEPENDENCE
None of the dimensions should be seen as distinct among themselves; they 
are all interrelated to one degree or another. A change in one can impact 
another. And it can have ethical implications, too. For example, the poli-
tics can deteriorate between two countries, resulting in the two companies 
not interacting with each other. Each side can hold back information or 
sabotage the work of the others, causing a project to fail.
The relationships among all the aforementioned dimensions can become 
quite complex when the following three relationships are considered: indepen-
dence, integration, and interdependence among all the elements of a project.
Independence reflects the degree of autonomy that each of the compo-
nents (e.g., stakeholders, processes) has on a project. Interdependence is 
the degree of reliance the output of a component has on another com-
ponent. Integration is the degree to which each component interacts 
with each other. In the global environment all three play a critical role in 

190  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
ensuring that all components work efficiently and effectively when deliv-
ering a product or service to the customer.
At first, it appears unclear why this is important from an ethical stand-
point. The fact is that it is very important. If, for example, a key stake-
holder, refuses to share information, deliberately does substandard work, 
or sells proprietary information to a competitor, then the entire relation-
ship among the components can go awry, or get out of sync. In the global 
environment, this circumstance can have a high impact on the perfor-
mance of a project where strategic, collaborative relationships are often 
common. If a partner or key supplier fails to perform, either by design or 
accident, the consequences can become quite apparent.
Culture, too, plays an important role in affecting the relationship among 
key stakeholders when it comes to ethical behavior. Culture, of course, is 
the totality of a host of factors like religion, ways of behaving, relationship 
protocols, and perception of time.
Kluckholn and Strodtbeck developed a framework to ascertain how dif-
ferent societies respond to different issues, concerns, or problems, which 
includes how people relate to their physical environment, seek immediate 
or delayed gratification, focus on a time spectrum consisting of the past, 
present, or future, perceive people in a negative or positive light, and pre-
fer to work independently or collectively.* In a similar way, the Hofstede 
framework looks at four areas regarding culture: (1) individual or collective; 
(2) power; (3) uncertainty avoidance; and (4) masculinity versus feminini-
ty.† Thomas and Inkson identified three key elements for understanding 
what they refer to as cultural intelligence when it comes to ethics in a global 
environment: (1) knowledge of understanding a project manager’s mental 
model for determining what is and is not ethical; (2) being mindful, iden-
tifying who will benefit and who will lose by a decision or action; and (3) 
behavioral skills, acknowledging that differences in values exist while at 
the same time adhering to a consistent, personal set of values.‡
Whether using these or other frameworks, they help in understand-
ing how ethics are intertwined with culture. For example, using the 
Kluckholn and Strodtbeck framework, people from a culture that seeks 
to work independently may resist any teaming efforts to complete a major

deliverable for a project, regardless of impact to other stakeholders. People 
from an independent culture may deliberately decide to withhold key 
information or share other important resources for the overall good of a 
project because doing so may violate certain principles, such as political 
allegiance or historical animosity.
8.4  CHALLENGES
Ethics is not an easy topic to wrestle with in the international arena. 
Project managers must confront a number of challenges that can lead to 
ethical dilemmas and must deal with them.
There are the two fundamental perspectives of a team of people from 
different cultures: the host country and the home country. The perspec-
tives can be quite dramatic, especially for someone who has not worked 
previously outside of their country. People become entrenched in their 
own culture and, if not given the appropriate time to adjust, can find it 
difficult to adapt. In other words, a person can experience culture shock, a 
real powerful inhibitor to the ability of some people to work with others. 
Over time, culture shock usually dissipates and the person adapts. If the 
culture is so engrained by the person from another country or the people 
of the host country then the relationships can deteriorate.
There is another fundamental question: Can good project performance 
be achieved while operating ethically? While most people answer yes, the 
answer does not become so clear when working on a crucial project that 
involves, for instant, a compressed schedule (e.g., fast-tracking). The pres-
sure to deliver faster, better, and cheaper may result in people, either by 
design or accident, cutting corners using unethical means.
There are also differences in decision making. For example, some 
cultures take a long time to make a decision due to taking a collective 
approach; other cultures make decisions quickly due to one person using 
little deliberation. This challenge can frustrate either side if the circum-
stances cause considerable pressure to decide and act, resulting in one side 
ignoring the other.
Additionally, policies and procedures of two different firms can exist, 
especially those of companies from two different countries. The compa-
nies can operate like two battleships at sea that never quite sail in tan-
dem because the crews of each one are doing something different on their 

192  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
vessels. In other words, all the cultural differences and the challenge get 
magnified because people operate under a different set of rules. This chal-
lenge is often more difficult for people working on the same team but not 
from the same company.
When projects involve people from one or more countries, many laws 
and regulations can also come into play. Stakeholders on a global project 
often have to be aware of the laws and regulations of not only their own 
country but also of those of other countries. These laws and regulations 
might have to do with immigration, taxation, environment, labor, or gift 
giving and may not be in sync.
Business protocols may also differ among multiple nationalities on a 
global project. Gift giving is a prime example where protocols vary widely. 
One company may have substantial restrictions placed on it by the home 
country while the host country does not; the exchange can then become 
very complicated when interpreting the law, leading easily to a potential 
ethical dilemma.
The infrastructure can add a challenge. This one includes roads, engi-
neering, information technology, and the banking system of either the 
host or home country of the companies working together on a project. 
If one is less developed than the other, a company may find that it has no 
other choice but to take action that may circumvent the laws and regula-
tions of a country to complete its work.
Also, motivation varies from one culture to the next. While all people 
share common physiological needs, the other needs, such as the ones 
identified by Abraham Maslow or Frederick Herzberg, begin to vary dra-
matically. In some cultures, the group rather than the individual becomes 
more important. In some other cultures, materialism continues to be of 
primary importance, whereas in others less tangible incentives seem to 
work. The differences can prove quite challenging on a project because 
if the expectations around motivation are not met then a breach of trust 
may arise, leading to a host of ethical dilemmas, often centered on not 
communicating.
How people process and act on information can vary, too. Some people 
from other cultures involve taking time to assess the information they 
receive and then act on it. Other people from different a culture may take 
little time to assess information then act upon it right away. Neither one 
is right or wrong, but, when the two vary, one may deliberately ignore the 
other, even to point of bringing a project to a standstill over differences in 
style rather than substance.

Ethics, Globalization, and Project Management  •  193
Value systems may also vary widely among individuals on a global 
project. In many respects this one is the hardest challenge and is often 
the source of legal complications, especially when it comes to gift giving 
and receiving or the treatment of certain team members. Project manag-
ers need to account for the differences in value systems because it affects 
the relationships among stakeholders and the quality of the results. They 
should also appreciate that laws and regulations often reflect cultural val-
ues and that failure to respect them can lead to ethical dilemmas.
Coupled with value systems, language is a major challenge and can lead 
to many inadvertent ethical dilemmas. Even if everyone on a project team 
speaks a common language like English, for example, the same word can 
have a different meaning to the person who spoke it and the one who 
heard it. Add values and geographical distance and the opportunity for 
problems is endless. Not just verbal language can be a problem. Body lan-
guage can also pose a serious problem on a project. How people express 
themselves physically can influence how the message is interpreted, which 
means people react in a way that was never intended. Space, touch, and 
movement can all play a role in causing people to respond or react that can 
prove harmful to the outcome of a project.
Working styles can additionally lead to ethical complications. How peo-
ple go about their responsibilities on the job differs, and such differences 
can become even more apparent between two or more people from unique 
cultures. Differences, for example, can occur over the breadth and depth 
of planning and following plans during execution. For some people, they 
may take shortcuts that may violate a policy or law to achieve a scheduled 
completion date.
Closely allied to the last point, management style can also contribute to 
ethical complications. Management style can vary from being extremely 
autocratic to being very laissez-faire. Too much of the former can cause 
people to hide ethical dilemmas for fear of being the messenger who is 
shot; in the latter, people take a view that ethics is a “nice to know” topic 
but is never to be taken seriously.
Working relationships, too, may produce ethical complications. Two 
different nationalities, which have a long historical animosity toward one 
another, can lead to some of their members on their project intentionally 
not saying anything to key people from the other nationality just for the 
sake of seeing the latter get into trouble despite having the responsibility 
to inform them.

194  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
Different attitudes toward risk taking can also vary from nationality 
to nationality. Some nationalities embrace change and are willing to take 
risks; others may be reluctant to take a risk. Either side may make a deci-
sion that can affect the outcome of a project. For example, some members 
of a team may be from a certain nationality that embraces risk taking; 
they decide to recklessly take an action without asking others about the 
consequences of a particular decision or action on the overall project or 
an entire organization.
Finally, social stratification within a particular culture can affect ethics 
on a project. Even people from the same nationality, especially tradition-
ally hierarchical ones, may be overly obedient to their “superiors,” laying 
the groundwork for subordinates to behave in ways that may violate the 
values of team members of another nationality.
Three additional factors pose challenges to projects in a global environ-
ment from an ethical perspective.
One, if the supply chain is immense and extremely integrated, commu-
nications and trust are important ingredients for success. Unfortunately, 
if at some point the level of communications and trust no longer works, 
the supply chain can break, after which time the potential for ethical issues 
and transgressions can occur (e.g., shipment of goods containing substan-
dard components that could lead to injury or death to the consumer).
Two, trade barriers could become or are perceived as so onerous that 
importers and exporters try to circumvent them. This situation then 
entices them to seek illegal entry or egress from a country to meet cost 
and schedule constraints.
Third, historical animosities that seem to have dissipated over time can 
quickly reignite over differences in approach or even from the result of 
an international incident. Members of a project team may, for example, 
intentionally withhold information that could impact the performance of 
a project.
8.5  BREEDING GROUND AND CONSEQUENCES
The international environment provides a breeding ground for three 
unethical dilemmas that are frequently not found, or at least not as appar-
ent, within the borders of the United States.

Ethics, Globalization, and Project Management  •  195
Cheaper labor and materials is the first. In the developing world, due 
mainly to historical circumstances, the world’s supply of labor and non-
labor resources is often considerably cheaper than those in developed 
countries. Developed countries may, and often do, exploit this situation 
by having projects that tap such inexpensive resources. This can lead to 
exploitation on projects that would likely never happen in the United 
States and most places in Europe. Ethics violation may include not respect-
ing labor laws or exploiting children to develop deliverables for a project.
Countries with fewer laws and regulations is second. Some global com-
panies will have international projects that have less government involve-
ment, granting much flexibility in how they go about completing their 
projects. While there may not be an ethical violation from a legal perspec-
tive, they could still be performing ethical violations—nonetheless from a 
moral perspective. They could be using children, could be testing products 
on people before marketing deliverables in developed countries, or could 
be using political prisoners to do work for the project. International proj-
ects may also exploit countries having weaker environmental standards as 
well as virtually nonexistent labor laws.
Black market is the third. The black market is a subterranean economy 
that often reflects the free market more than the “official” one. People can 
buy goods and services that might not ordinarily be available to an open 
market of supply and demand. Some international projects may exploit 
the black market to obtain materials at costs and in quantities that may 
not be possible to acquire in the regular market at the desired level. In the 
black market, too, goods, not just money, can be exchanged. Operating in 
a black market is illegal in a country, of course, but the incentives from a 
monetary standpoint may be such that companies and their projects may 
engage in them.
Innumerable ethical issues may be of interest to companies and projects. 
Here is a just a sample list of topics relevant to a global project that may 
have potential ethical implications:
•	 Child labor
•	 Discrimination
•	 Employment hiring and dismissal
•	 Financial improprieties (e.g., money laundering)
•	 Forced labor (e.g., use of political prisoners)
•	 Gifts, bribery, and kickbacks

196  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
•	 Harassment (e.g., physical, sexual, psychological)
•	 Harmful products
•	 Human rights
•	 Immigration
•	 Intellectual property
•	 Marketing and advertising
•	 Pollution
•	 Price discrimination (e.g., price gouging, dumping)
•	 Privacy
•	 Sweatshops
Regardless of location, engaging in unethical activities on a global proj-
ect can have severe consequences to the initiators of an unethical trans-
gression and the recipients.
One consequence is the impact to the health, safety, and general welfare 
of the people, for example, who are being exploited or disrespected and the 
people who might be receiving the flawed final product or service.
Another consequence is the tarnished reputation of the parent company 
sponsoring the project that committed the unethical activity. With the 
rise of global communications via satellite television and the Internet, a 
major project that engages in unethical activities and gets discovered can 
ruin the reputation of a company almost overnight, causing its stock to 
plummet and the company to lose contracts.
Still another one is the fines and penalties that may be levied on a com-
pany and stakeholders on the applicable project. Even though the fines and 
penalties may be less than the gain from performing unethical business, it 
can impact any opportunity for a continued working relationship within 
the host country. In the end, the costs in terms of lost revenue and prof-
its may far exceed the fines and penalties that the company could receive 
because of the unethical actions of people on a project.
8.6  KEY ACTIONS
International projects, therefore, can offer high rewards but if not handled 
in an ethical way can have a huge, negative impact on a company. If real or 
perceived unethical rewards are not handled correctly, then the negative 
consequences will become a reality. Project managers need to be aware of 

Ethics, Globalization, and Project Management  •  197
some of the actions to deal with unethical issues and transgressions that 
may arise.
One, team members should be encouraged to enhance cultural aware-
ness. People should be urged to learn about the historical, customs, busi-
ness protocols, politics, and other background information as a way to 
achieve higher levels of awareness. Such knowledge enables everyone to be 
more attuned to cultural sensitivities as well as to work with people from 
other cultures.
Two, identify the “normal” ways of doing business in a particular country. 
Every culture, even within different regions of a country, has unique proto-
cols that it will be necessary to honor and respect. Of course, that does not 
mean doing something illegal; instead, it means understanding and reconcil-
ing what is permissible in all involved cultures. By no means should a proj-
ect manager violate his country’s or the host country’s laws and regulation 
because that is the way of doing business. However, behaviors and actions 
should be honored that generate respect and honor among stakeholders.
Three, understand that cultural norms can vary within a country. The 
northern part of the country could be dramatically different in the con-
duct of business from other regions; what is permissible in one region, 
in other words, may not be permissible in other regions. This case exists 
especially in large countries with multiple ethnicities.
Four, remember that culture shock goes both ways. Whether a project is 
being managed in another country or in the United States, supervising a 
team of people from different countries adjustment can be quite difficult. 
There is a period of regret followed by acceptance of coming to another 
country. Anyone in such an environment is going to have a difficult time 
transitioning because their expectations and frame of reference need to 
adapt to the new environment. Failure to adapt may lead to inadvertently 
behaving in a certain way that may be construed as not only disrespectful 
but also unethical in the host country.
Five, seek to use a common language on an international project whether 
it is English, French, Spanish, or Mandarin. A common language, however, 
does not guarantee that everyone will communicate effectively and the 
team will perform like a well-oiled machine. That is because there may be 
differences in accents, in use of certain words, and interpretation of words. 
A simple word in English, for example, can have one connotation to one 
person and a totally different meaning to another, resulting in an unethi-
cal issue or transgression simply because the word was misinterpreted.

198  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
Six, be aware of the different frameworks for dealing with people from 
different cultures in a host country or in another. Many of these models 
center around what some people believe is a common set of values that 
are applicable no matter where a business relationship exists; these values, 
naturally, are applicable to projects, too.
•	 Tom Donaldson developed a framework that basically emphasizes 
that any negative responsibilities or duties avoid causing harm 
(referred to as minimalist) and that any positive ones provide posi-
tive support for a project (referred to as maximalist). He then iden-
tified 10 cross-cultural, universal values ranging from freedom of 
movement to right to a fair trial to free speech.*
•	 Richard DeGeorge also provides 10 guidelines related to eth-
ics, including doing no intentional harm, respecting the rights of 
employees, respecting local culture, paying taxes, and cooperating 
with local governments.†
•	 Rushworth Kidder reduced the number of values for dealing ethi-
cally with people from other cultures. These values are even less tan-
gible and include love, freedom, and fairness.6
A few international organizations or associations, such as Caux Round 
Table Business Principles of Ethics, have adopted some core principles 
for dealing with other cultures and countries across the globe. The prin-
ciples cover topics like building a spirit of trust, having respect for the 
environment, treating employees with dignity and respect, and respecting 
human rights, to name just a few.‡
8.7  FINAL THOUGHTS
The key, of course, is subscribing not just to the concepts and principles herein 
but also to their actual exercise on a global project, whether within the United 
States or outside of it. Due diligence and due care are inseparable; both are

necessary to ensure an ethical environment exists. A failure in due diligence 
will more likely lead to a failure in due care. A failure in due care is often a 
reflection of a failure of due diligence. Project managers, of course, should 
make a concerted effort to think and behave ethically and expect the same of 
other stakeholders regardless of whether a project is domestic or global. It is 
not enough to simply say, “When in Rome do what the Romans do.”

Making Ethics a Reality
A common theme throughout this book is that project managers face 
many challenges when attempting to make ethics a major subject over 
their projects. Ethics just seems to take a backseat to topics like sched-
uling, estimating, building charters, applying earned value management, 
applying integrated change control, and many other concepts, tools, and 
techniques of project management. They can no longer accept this status 
quo if they have the desire to successfully resolve ethical dilemmas.
9.1  WHY ETHICS TAKES A BACK SEAT
There are many reasons ethics is not made a priority. It is frequently 
viewed as something people have to do because the higher-ups got the 
company in trouble and need to demonstrate to the shareholders and the 
government that they are doing something to make everyone ethical. The 
topic of ethics is considered by some to be touchy-feely and to enhance 
people’s intellectual knowledge and nothing more. Someone with greater 
authority may think it is a good subject to talk about it but do not provide 
a work environment conducive to ethical behavior. It could also be viewed 
as a “flavor of the month” topic so common in corporate environments.
Ethics, particularly related to projects, is very serious. When ethics is used 
on projects, people can focus on performing their responsibilities rather than 
on deciding and acting in ways that can damage the reputation of the people 
on the project, the project itself, and the parent organization. In other words, 
people can concentrate on doing what is right and necessary to complete a 
project successfully. The negative aspects, of course, are that the people exces-
sively take their time making decisions and actions, covering their tracks, 

204  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
and exploiting circumstances rather than focusing on performing their 
responsibilities in a way that leads to the successful execution of a project.
The best way to realize the importance of ethics is to compare projects 
with and without ethics. If project managers and other stakeholders think 
and act ethically, interim deliverables (e.g., a charter, plans, reports) will 
serve as reliable outputs that can be trusted to help produce the final deliv-
erable to the customer. Everyone knows that the interim deliverables are 
the result of honest, trustworthy people and therefore can be used with a 
high degree of confidence. Now take a different perspective. If the project 
manager and other stakeholders are known to be unethical in thought and 
deed, to what extent will people have confidence in the interim deliver-
ables and, ultimately, the final deliverable being produced? You guessed it: 
They will have very little faith in others and the output.
The lessons to bring from this scenario are twofold: Ethics has value on 
a project; and ethics has consequences. Ethics on a project is like blood. 
If unethical behavior is tolerated, then it will spread like tainted blood, 
damaging the organs. If ethical behavior is the norm, then it will allow the 
organs to do their jobs.
9.2  MAKING ETHICS ON PROJECTS A REALITY
Having good ethics on a project is not simple. Project managers must take 
action to allow good ethical decisions and behaviors to become the norm 
rather than the exception. Five actions will accomplish this:
One. embrace a code of ethics, regardless of professional organization. 
Most of them cover the same topics to varying degrees of breadth and 
depth. They provide standards and guidelines not only for routine situ-
ations but also for anomalous circumstances. Sometimes, people need a 
guidepost to help them navigate through difficult circumstances. The 
Project Management Institute (PMI) provides an excellent code of ethics 
that is applicable for all stakeholders to consider following on a project. It 
covers a wide range of topics, including responsibility, respect, fairness, 
conflict of interest, and honesty. Regardless of whether project manag-
ers are members of the PMI, they should all read its code of ethics. It is 
especially useful because it emphasizes taking a global perspective, serv-
ing as an excellent guide for dealing with ethical issues in an interna-
tional environment.

Making Ethics a Reality  •  205
Second, make ethics part of just about every significant decision or 
action, whether alone or as part of the group. Many decisions and actions 
have ethical consequences, some major and others minor. Asking and 
answering a simple question like, “Is this the right thing to do?” raises 
ethical considerations when making a decision or taking an action. An 
answer that is a categorical yes will likely not pose an ethical challenge 
to individuals. However, an answer that leaves some doubt should serve 
as a red flag, meaning that the decision or action requires some greater 
thought. If the decision or action makes people feel uneasy, there is some 
likelihood that a potentially ethical issue is involved.
Three, make ethics everyone’s business. The idea that ethics is the con-
cern of someone else is wrought with danger. Shifting responsibility can 
lead to people delegating, either vertically or horizontally in an organiza-
tion, and can give people license to make unethical decisions and actions. 
In other words, it becomes someone else’s concern. Everyone on the proj-
ect team needs to take ownership of the ethical consequences of their deci-
sions and actions.
Four, recognize that practicing ethics requires courage. Thinking, and 
even more so doing, the right thing is not easy. The pressures are immense 
in most corporate environments to conform. There are pressures from 
superiors, team members, colleagues, and other stakeholders to adhere 
to norms, mores, policies, and procedures. Any deviation, regardless of 
whether the decision or action is ethical, can result in being penalized, 
such as through ostracism, ridicule, and being ignored, demoted, and iso-
lated. This courage, of course, is exhibited by all stakeholders, not just the 
project manager. Therefore, project managers need to provide an environ-
ment that tolerates and even encourages people to raise ethical concerns 
on a project. To do otherwise can sooner or later lead to unethical deci-
sions and actions.
Five, remember that it is possible to have a successful completion of a 
project and still think and act ethically. Individuals can be ethical and 
still complete a project on time and within budget and satisfy customer 
goals and objectives. They are not diametrically opposed to each other. In 
fact, taking the high road in thought and deed will end up having positive 
consequences, even if the project finishes late, costs more than anticipated, 
and does not meet requirements; customers will likely make allowances 
for not succeeding because honesty and fairness has been practiced, for 
example, in working with them. Taking the low road, so to speak, will 
end up in an unsuccessful project even if the project finishes on time and 

206  •  Ethics and Project Management﻿
within budget and meets requirements because the results of the unethical 
decisions and actions will surface later during the product life cycle such 
as through litigation, high maintenance costs, and tarnished reputation.
9.3  THE MARK OF AN ETHICAL PROJECT MANAGER
Exercising these five actions will help make ethics a major concern on 
projects if it is not already. Just as importantly, these steps encourage 
objective judgment on what is the right decision and response when deal-
ing with ethical situations after considering all options, which is the mark 
of an ethical project manager.

Project Management
Ethics plays a critical role in project management, but all too often, its 
importance is overlooked. This benign neglect can result in serious 
consequences to individuals and organizations, ranging from tarnished 
reputations to civil and criminal liability. Ethics and Project Management 
demonstrates the importance of making ethics a key consideration in 
managing projects and describes the impacts that occur when ethical 
transgressions arise.
Providing the tools necessary for project managers to avoid an ethical 
lapse that can put themselves and their organization at risk, this volume:
• Defines ethics and places it within the project management context
• Discusses the contents of the Project Management Institute’s  
code of ethics
• Enables project managers to recognize some of the trends  
that precipitate ethical dilemmas on a project
• Demonstrates how ethical concerns permeate the entire  
project life cycle
• Provides tips on establishing a governance protocol to  
ensure ethical compliance
• Explores legal issues that arise from unethical behavior
• Examines how ethical concerns on a project can have global 
implications, and how to operate in international settings with 
cultural differences
Each chapter ends with a Getting Started Checklist, facilitating immediate 
application of the concepts discussed and making it easy for project 
managers to determine whether they are in compliance with ethical 
standards. Providing a solid roadmap for the ethical health of a project, 
this volume is essential reading for all those concerned with avoiding the 
disastrous consequences of a cavalier approach to ethics.
