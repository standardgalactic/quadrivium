 CHAPTER 1
 THE KING OF SKAMPAVIA
 "Is this all?" The King of Skampavia frowned at the great stack of bags,
  bales, crates and carriers heaped around his throne. Leaning forward, he
  gingerly extracted a fig from one of the baskets and popped it into his
  enormous mouth. "Pah, dry as a blotter," spluttered the red-faced ruler,
  gritting his teeth with disgust, "and look at those cocoanuts, no bigger
  round than a baby's rattle!" Leaping off his throne, he began kicking at
  the baskets of vegetables and bales of cotton and other merchandise. "What
  dusty junk is this?" he raged, glaring furiously at Pinny Penny, his
  patient Prime Minister. "How dare they send me such stuff?" Clasping and
  unclasping his hands nervously, Pinny Penny nevertheless spoke up boldly.
 "Because they have nothing better, your Majesty. What can our poor subjects
  do with land so unprofitable and barren? Then, not only must they produce
  enough for their own needs, but are required by the law to give one-third
  of all they raise to the crown."
 "And why not?" blustered Skamperoo, settling back argumentatively on his
  throne. "I am the KING! You can't get around that, you know."
 "No," sighed Pinny Penny, and drawing aside one of the shabby curtains, he
  looked sorrowfully out into the courtyard.
 "What's all that racket?" demanded his Master as a medley of shouts, roars,
  and dull thuds came rolling up to them. Forgetting his anger for a moment,
  he bounded to his feet and came across the room to look over Pinny Penny's
  shoulder.

 "A slight argument seems to have arisen among the Supervisors," murmured
  Pinny Penny resignedly.
 Now Skampavia, I must tell you, is roughly divided into seven counties, and
  over eachcountySkamperoohad set a Supervisor whose duty it was to govern
  the province and to turn over to him one-third of all produce and
  merchandise in that county. To save time and easily identify them, the
  supervisors were known by the size of the counties they governed. For
  instance, the Supervisor of theFirstCounty, which was one mile wide and
  ten miles long, was called Onebyten; the Supervisor of theSecondCounty
  Twobyfour; and the others were variously known as Threebysix, Ninebyfive,
  Eightby-eight, Fivebynine, and Fourbyseven. Twice a year the Supervisors
  rode into the capital with their tribute, and now, down in the courtyard,
  the seven tremendous Skampavians were in a perfect pitched battle, helped
  out by all the guards and palace servants.
 "Argument!" roared the King, slapping Pinny Penny rudely on the shoulder.
  "It's a fight, and you know it! Ho, ho! Just look at the good-for-nothing
  rascals. I tell you, old Two Pins, however poorly they serve us as farmers
  and merchants, our Skampavians can certainly fight. And who says I'm too
  hard on them? Have I not given every man Jack a dress uniform and gun and
  made them learn military drilling and marching at theRoyalCollege?"
 "And what use is all this drilling and marching?" inquired Pinny Penny
  wearily. Letting the curtain fall, he hurried away, for well he knew, if he
  did not put a stop to the conflict in the courtyard, every window in the
  palace would be broken.
 "Now what did he mean by that?" muttered Skamperoo peevishly as his little

  Prime Minister whisked out of sight. Pursing his lips, he seated himself
  heavily on his throne. After all, Pinny Penny had only spoken the truth.
  Why had his father or his father's father ever picked out this pesky little
  country in the first place? Located in the southern part of the desert of
  Noland, between the Kingdoms of Ix and Merryland, Skampavia, he was forced
  to admit, had neither riches, beauty, nor interest. His castle, though poor
  and shabby, was comfortable enough, and having lived in it all his life, he
  was used to it. He had put up with the hot, dry climate and the poor
  quality of the food, but after all, why should he continue to do so? In
  those long-ago days in the schoolroom he had studied of energetic rulers
  who had taken their armies and gone forth to conquer richer and more
  desirable lands from their neighbors. Well, then, why should not he take
  his men, push over the border into a more fertile and kindly land? The idea
  pleased but at the same time annoyed him. Skamperoo was fat and lazy. He
  loved quiet and ease, and the thought of a hard military campaign made him
  shudder with distaste. Still, he reflected, remembering Pinny Penny's
  reproachful face, a King should do something for his subjects, and the more
  he did for them Ho, ho! the more he could make them do for him. A
  rich and prosperous country meant a rich and prosperous ruler.
  Discontentedly fingering the rough cloth from which his royal robes were
  fashioned, he began to picture himself decked out in splendid satins and
  velvets heavily encrusted with jewels. Jewels. Pah! All the jewels he had
  were his plain gold scepter, badly dented and bent from hurling at Pinny
  Penny. Taking off the crown, he scowled at it critically and began
  considering the realms on either side of his own dominions.
 To the north there was nothing but a sandy strip of desert and the tossing

  waters of theNonesticOcean. East lay theKingdomofIx, and Zixie (sic)
  the little Queen he considered too pleasant and friendly to conquer.
  Besides, the climate of Ix was not much better than that of his own
  country. To the west of Skampavia was Merryland, and at one time a band of
  his roistering Skampavians had crossed over into that country bent on theft
  and mischief. Recalling the way they had been welcomed and entertained by
  the cheerful King of Merryland and sent home simply laden with presents, he
  hastily dismissed that country too. How could he fight a monarch like that?
  To the south lay the burning sands of the Deadly Desert, which no man in
  his own Kingdom had ever succeeded in crossing.
 So having exhausted all the possibilities in the immediate neighborhood,
  Skamperoo tapped his foot in vexation and began casting about in his mind
  for some fair and faraway country to conquer. He closed his eyes in order
  to think better and was just on the point of falling into a pleasant doze
  of riches and conquest when Pinny Penny came noisily into the room. He was
  preceded by two of the King's Supervisors, who, urged forward by the
  fearless little Prime Minister, stood sulkily and defiantly before the
  throne.
 "Well, what now?" demanded Skamperoo, blinking his eyes sleepily. "Can you
  not handle these arguments yourself, Pinny Penny? Is a King to have no rest
  or privacy at all?"
 Instead of answering, Pinny Penny took a small cotton bag from the tallest
  of the Supervisors and handed it silently to the King. Still half asleep,
  Skamperoo untied the drawstring of the small bag and emptied the contents
  into his fat hand. What he saw there made his eyes fly open wide open.

  Jewels! The very thing for which he had been wishing. "Emeralds!" gasped
  the King, rubbing the glittering necklace between his fingers. "Where did
  you get this, Twobyfour?"
 "They were sent to your Majesty by a merchant in the Second County, who got
  them from a traveling peddler. The peddler had got them from a Gilliken,
  who had got them from a Quadling, who had got them from a Munchkin, who had
  once lived in the Emerald City of Oz."
 "OZ!" snapped the King, sitting up very straight. "Where is Oz?"
 "Oz is a great and powerful Kingdom on the other side of the Deadly Desert,"
  answered Twobyfour, looking uneasily over his shoulder at Pinny Penny.
 "Then how did this peddler cross the desert?" demanded Skamperoo, holding
  the necklace up to the light and feasting his eyes greedily on its gleaming
  emeralds.
 "That I cannot say." Twobyfour cast a longing glance at the door, heartily
  wishing himself on the other side.
 "Then perhaps you will tell us why you did not turn this necklace over to
  the king," suggested Pinny Penny mournfully.
 "Yes, how dared you keep it?" panted Skamperoo indignantly. "And what are
  you gaping at, Threebysix? I'll wager you were in this, too."
 "He was," shouted Twobyfour hoarsely. "He tried to steal the jewels from me.
  That's how he got the black eye."
 "But you tried to steal them from me, and what about that, my fine
  fellow?" Twobyfour turned a painful and uncomfortable scarlet under the
  King's accusing eye.
 "In Skampavia we have so little, your Majesty," he stuttered miserably.
  "With these emeralds I thought I might buy a bit of land in some cooler and

  more comfortable country where my wife and boys could be happy a
  country where flowers would grow in a garden, and where a man would not
  have to spend his whole life wrestling with rocks and weeds and drilling
  for hours in the hot sun for no reason whatsoever."
 "Hah!" exclaimed Pinny Penny, looking meaningly at the King.
 "Hah, yourself!" grunted Skamperoo wrathfully. Then, as the emeralds
  continued to sparkle and glitter in his hand, his anger subsided. "You did
  very wrong to keep the necklace, Twobyfour," he stated mildly. "But I have
  decided to forgive you. Return now to the Second County and explain to the
  merchant who gave you this necklace that I must have all three."
 "All three!" exclaimed Twobyfour. "But he's entitled by law to two of them."
 "My word is the law here, and you can choose between a broken law or a
  broken head," Skamperoo told him calmly.
 "He is the KING," murmured Pinny Penny in a quiet voice. There was nothing
  sarcastic in the manner of his speech, but something in the Prime
  Minister's expression made the King prickle with discomfort.
 "Yes, I am the King," he shouted explosively, "and moreover I have spoken.
  Begone, both of you, and YOU, Twobyfour, have two days to return with those
  two necklaces. The necklaces or your HEAD, do you understand? And er
  er you may tell that merchant in your county that he need send no
  more of his wares to the capital; the three necklaces will suffice," he
  bellowed as the two Supervisors went bolting through the door.
 "Now nice, they will suffice. You are the King," sniffed Pinny Penny with a
  sour smile.
 "Are you a parrot or a Prime Minister? Stop repeating that silly stuff and

  tell me about Oz," commanded Skamperoo, clasping the emerald necklace
  around his fat throat. "Have you ever heard of this place, Pinny Penny? It
  must be a rich and marvelous country if peddlers can trade emerald
  necklaces as carelessly as we trade wooden beads."
 "It is a marvelous country," answered Pinny Penny thoughtfully. "I remember
  my father telling me about the capital of Oz, an Emerald City where even
  the streets were inlaid with jewels, and every tower and wall was studded
  with emeralds."
 "Well, why have I never been told about this?" wheezed the King peevishly.
  "A country like that just a precious stone's throw away, so to speak."
 "Your Majesty has never cared for reading or study," Pinny Penny reminded
  him a bit maliciously. "In our library there is a whole history of Oz."
 "Fetch it! Fetch it, bring it to me at once!" panted the King, bouncing up
  and down on his throne like a big, bad baby (which in truth he was). "I
  must discover why Oz is so rich and prosperous while we are so poor and
  unfortunate."
 "Not so unfortunate and poor as we are unwise and greedy," stated Pinny
  Penny, stalking calmly across the room. "If your Majesty would study ways
  to improve Skampavia and allow your own subjects to keep a fair share of
  their crops and merchandise, we might be a powerful country, too."
 "Nonsense! What can we do with a rocky little desert like this?" blustered
  Skamperoo contemptuously. "Skampavia is a dull little Kingdom, a dumb
  little Kingdom a KingDUMB, that's a good name for it."
 "And you?" murmured Pinny Penny under his breath as he hastened away to
  fetch the book on Oz. Returning, he plumped the fat volume down on the
  King's knees and stood back with folded arms.

 "Well? Well? Do you expect me to read all this?" wailed Skamperoo in dismay.
  "Why, it would take a year or more. Explain it to me, Pinny Penny. Just
  give me the gist of the matter. Jist give me the gist there, I've made
  a joke. Ha! Ha! Ha! I've made a joke."
 "But Oz is no joke," said the Prime Minister shortly. "Your Majesty had
  better get that through your head at once. Now attend closely, and I will
  endeavor to give you the most important facts about this rich and
  enchanting country across the desert. In the first place," Pinny Penny
  looked severely over his specs, "Oz is about fifty times as large as
  Skampavia, a great, oblong, undulating country divided into four triangular
  Kingdoms. Each of these Kingdoms has its own ruler, but all four are
  subject to the rule of Ozma of Oz, whose capital, the Emerald City, is in
  the exact center of Oz.
 "A girl?" exclaimed Skamperoo, leaning forward excitedly. "How can a mere
  girl rule over an important country like that?"
 "By using her heart as well as her head, by encouraging thrift and rewarding
  industry," announced Pinny Penny in a tone that made the King wince. "Your
  Majesty would do well to read of her wise laws and plans for the betterment
  of her country."
 "You may just skip all that," sniffed Skamperoo, closing his mouth
  stubbornly. "Tell me, who are the rulers of these four Kingdoms and the
  general customs and characteristics of the people."
 Closing his eyes and putting his fingertips together, Pinny Penny began
  solemnly: "The Northernmost country of Oz is the Land of the Gillikens,
  famed for its luscious grapes, plums, wisteria, and heather. It is a purple

  country and is ruled over by Joe King and Queen Hyacinth, who live in an
  amethyst-trimmed castle high in the Gilliken Mountains. The Eastern Empire
  of Oz is a yellow country, known for its wheat, corn, butter, pumpkins,
  daffodils, and gold mines. Nick Chopper is Emperor of the Winkies, and this
  singular ruler is entirely made of tin plate and celebrated in song and
  story as `The Tin Woodman of Oz.'" Pinny Penny paused a moment to
  catch his breath and then continued quietly:
 "The Southland is red and noted for its strawberries, tomatoes, beets, red
  birds, red wood, and red heads. Glinda, the Good Sorceress, governs the
  Quadlings, who make up its inhabitants, and she knows as much magic as Ozma
  herself"
 "Oh, it's one of those magic places where one just snaps the fingers to get
  what he wants," sighed the King discontentedly. "Well Well, go on
 "
 "The Western Country of Oz is blue," continued Pinny Penny obligingly, "and
  everyone has heard of its famous Blue Ridge Mountains, its blue birds, its
  violets, its blue skies, and its capital, the Sapphire City. Cheeriobed is
  King and Orin is Queen of the Munchkins, and they live in the Sapphire City
  in almost as much magnificence as Ozma in the Emerald City. Is that all you
  wish to know?"
 "About the army," muttered Skamperoo, wrinkling up his forehead. "Has this
  girl ruler a great army stationed at her capital?"
 Pinny Penny grinned in spite of himself. "The young fairy ruler of Oz is
  opposed to all wars and fighting and has at her court an army consisting of
  one tall soldier with green whiskers," he explained hurriedly.
 "One soldier with green whiskers!" shouted the King, nearly tumbling off his

  throne. "I never heard anything more ridiculous in my life. I thought you
  said Oz wasn't a joke, and yet you stand there and tell me about an army
  with one soldier. Why, that's the funniest thing I ever heard. Ha, haw,
  haw!"
 "Laugh if you wish," said Pinny Penny resignedly, "but don't forget that
  Ozma has more magic at her fingertips than we have pebbles on our desert.
  In her palace lives the famous Wizard of Oz, who can work every sort of
  transformation and enchantment, but does so only for the good of the
  country."
 "Humph!" exclaimed the King. "Well, how many fighting men have we?"
 "Seven hundred Skampavian soldiers in each of the seven counties," answered
  Pinny Penny reluctantly, "but let me warn your Majesty that the idea you
  have in your head is sheer madness and will lead to nothing but ruin. Take
  off your crown, put on your nightcap and dream away this foolishness."
 "And a fine-looking crown it is," snapped the King, snatching off his crown
  and looking at it angrily. "But these emeralds will brighten it up a bit,
  eh Pinny Penny?"
 "It is not the sparkle of gems in a King's crown that count, it is the
  jewels of wisdom in the head under the crown that make him happy and well
  beloved"
 "Stop! Enough!" yelled the King, hurling the crown with all his might at
  Pinny Penny. "When will you stop this infernal lecturing and scolding?"
 "When your Majesty stops talking nonsense," sighed Pinny, catching the crown
  with one hand and pulling a long bell cord with the other. "Come now, let
  us have our tea and forget about Oz," he proposed calmly. "Lemon or cream,

  your Highness?"
 "Lemon!" growled the King sourly, and slapping open the book of history on
  his knees, he stared long and enviously at a picture of the Emerald City of
  Oz.
  
 CHAPTER 2
 THE KING AND THE MERCHANT
 Two days had passed since Skamperoo had come into possession of the emerald
  necklace. He had never taken it off for a moment. He even wore it to bed,
  and spent most of the daytime admiring himself and it in the palace
  mirrors. Now, as the afternoon of the second day drew to a close, he kept
  bouncing over to the windows that commanded a view of the Highway.
 "If that rascal does not turn up soon, I'll I'll"
 "Explode, probably," predicted Pinny Penny, who was playing solitaire with
  the only pack of cards the castle afforded. "Calm yourself, Skamper, what
  good are these emeralds when you come right down to it?"
 "Good? Good? They are worth more than this whole miserable castle," answered
  the King indignantly. "I can sell them and buy no, no, I'll never part
  with them," he corrected himself hastily. "They give me a feeling of
  importance and power. Our star has risen, Pinny Penny. Great days are
  ahead. Hark! Listen! Is that a footstep in the courtyard?" Darting back to
  the window, the portly monarch flattened his nose against the pane. "It's
  Tooby! It's Twobyfour!" he shouted, hopping up and down like a schoolboy.
  "And there's a tall, bearded stranger with him."
 "If your Majesty will quietly seat yourself, I'll endeavor to announce
  them," reproved Pinny Penny, gathering up his cards. "Remember, you are a

  King and not a jumping jack."
 "Oh all right." Skamperoo flung himself heavily down among his cushions,
  and presently the tramp of feet along the corridor proclaimed the arrival
  of the long-awaited Supervisor. Pinny Penny advanced stiffly to meet him
  and after a whispered conversation, he called out in a bored voice:
  "Twobyfour, Governor of our Second Province, and Matiah the Merchant, your
  Majesty!"
 "Yes! Yes? But where are the emeralds?" panted Skamperoo, leaning forward
  eagerly as the two travelers advanced respectfully to the throne. Drawing a
  small bag from his leather jerkin, Twobyfour held it sullenly out to the
  King.
 "Here, your Majesty, and here also is the merchant who goes with the
  necklace." Twobyfour haughtily indicated the turbaned Skampavian beside
  him.
 "Yes! Yes, the merchant." The King, intent upon the jewels, did not even
  look up. "He goes with the necklaces, you say? Well, ha! Ha! Now he may go
  without them. That is all I require of you, my good fellow. Your presence
  here is not necessary or desirable. You may go. GO, do you understand?"
 "Go?" Matiah drew himself up to his fullest height, which was pretty high, I
  can tell you. "Perhaps your Majesty will suggest where? For these three
  necklaces I traded my house, my shops, and all my other possessions. You
  say that is all, and it is indeed. Since you have taken all I own and
  possess, your Majesty must take me also. You owe me a living, and I am here
  to say so."
 "Say no more," put in Pinny Penny soothingly. "Matiah is right, Skamperoo,

  and well within his rights as well. We must make a place for him in the
  palace. What can you do?" he inquired practically.
 "Do?" The merchant opened his eyes very wide. "Do? I am a merchant
  accustomed to dealing in jewels, china, cloth, and basketwear (sic)."
 "Then you'll be the very one to help out in the kitchen and laundry,"
  proposed Pinny Penny brightly. "There are no jewels, but we have onions and
  potatoes aplenty, and with the dirty dishes and hampers of soiled linens
  you will be right at home."
 "What?" screamed Matiah as Twobyfour snickered behind his hand. "You require
  this mean-ial toil of me Matiah, son of Metorah, son of Metanic,
  merchants for these thousands of years? This is preposterous! An outrage! I
  will go! I will go indeed. I will start a war, an uprising, a revolution!
  Help! Help! Help!" yelled the merchant shrilly. "The King has stolen my
  emeralds."
 "Stop! Stop! Not so loud," begged Skamperoo, leaping agilely off his throne
  and pattering anxiously after Matiah. "You may leave us, Pinny Penny, I
  think I can find something better than kitchen work for this honest
  citizen."
 "Humph!" snorted Pinny Penny, and motioning for Twobyfour to follow him, he
  marched disapprovingly from the royal presence.
 "You musn't mind old Pinny," puffed the King, dropping a bit breathlessly on
  his throne. "There, there, now, sit down and make yourself comfortable. As
  I was saying, Pinny Penny has very odd notions at times."
 "Very odd," agreed Matiah, and seating himself on a chair opposite the King,
  he fastened his eyes greedily on the sparkling chains now clasped firmly
  about the monarch's fat throat.

 "Now, then, we must find something easy and pleasant for you," went on the
  King, scratching one ear reflectively. "You might, er you might spend
  your time entertaining me. I'll wager you are just full of good stories,
  songs, and amusing tricks."
 "Tricks?" exclaimed the merchant, elevating his nose disdainfully. Then a
  sudden gleam came into his small, black eyes. "Tricks!" he repeated more
  pleasantly. "Ah, your Majesty is right. How well you have guessed my
  secret." Leaning forward, he held his hand up to his mouth, and looking
  furtively over his shoulder whispered hoarsely, "I am a magician, King, and
  well versed in the arts of sorcery."
 "Sorcery!" cried Skamperoo, clasping himself delightedly about his middle.
  "How perfectly panormick! Magic is the very thing we need around here. Tell
  me quickly, what can you do? How much magic do you know?"
 "Is there some place where we can be quite alone?" Matiah held up his hand
  mysteriously. "NO one must know I am a magician. It must be a secret
  between us."
 "Of course! Of course!" agreed the King, rolling off his throne with more
  speed than dignity. "Come to my private walled garden. No one can hear us
  there."
 "No one?" asked Matiah sharply. "Are there then no guards upon the wall?"
 "No guards, no servants, no one at all is allowed in my garden," the King
  assured him proudly.
 "And is there a door in the garden's wall?" Matiah, stroking his long beard,
  stood regarding the King thoughtfully. "My first trick requires a door."
 "Of course there's a door, or how should I get out and in myself? Come

  along, come along!" Waddling into the corridor, Skamperoo started off at a
  quick trot for his private garden. Matiah, grinning wickedly to himself,
  stepped softly after the King. Once in the garden, he meant to have his
  necklaces, even if he had to take off the King's head to get them.
 "One sweep of my scimitar," murmured the merchant to himself, "Ho, ho! this
  is too easy!" The King's garden when they reached it was no more than a
  small, sandy square with some cactus plants in the center and a rickety
  bench against the wall. Seating himself heavily on the bench, Skamperoo
  made room for the merchant beside him.
 "Now, then," he grunted hurriedly. "Begin. Show me what you can do. Prove
  that you are a magician."
 "First I must have the necklaces," stated Matiah calmly. "Without the
  necklaces I cannot do a single trick."
 "But but if the magic is in the emeralds, I can be my own magician,"
  answered Skamperoo, clutching the chains with both hands.
 "But your Majesty is not a magician," Matiah told him reasonably. "You do
  not know the proper words or incantations. No, I myself must wear these
  magic jewels. And what harm is there in that? As soon as your wish is
  granted, I will hand them straight back to you."
 "What's that? Can you really grant wishes?" Skamperoo's eyes began to snap
  and dance with greed and interest.
 "Certainly," promised Matiah, blinking shrewdly across the square and
  estimating with his eye the distance he should have to run to reach the
  door in the garden wall. "All you have to do is to think of something you
  want, close your eyes, count slowly to a hundred, and I, wearing the three
  necklaces, will easily grant your wish. I thought you trusted me and that

  we were going to be friends," he finished reproachfully.
 "We were. Er, that is HERE, take them!" Unclasping the heavy chains,
  Skamperoo, who already had a wish in mind, thrust them into the merchant's
  hands. Closing his eyes, he made his wish and then began to count
  hysterically, "One, two, three, four, five, six." At six, Matiah was
  halfway across the garden, when horrors! A great white horse with a golden
  tail and mane dropped like a plummet from the sky. Pawing up the sand in
  Matiah's path, he flashed his yellow eyes so wickedly, the merchant fell
  back into the cactus bushes, where he lay screaming with shock, pain and
  amazement. But Skamperoo, thinking all the noises he heard were but magic
  incantations, went calmly on with his counting. He had reached sixty before
  Matiah had recovered himself enough to crawl out of the cactus and make his
  way cautiously back to the bench. The immense white horse continued to
  stare at him threateningly, but as it made no attempt to spring forward, he
  began to regain a little of his usual assurance and courage.
 "Great Garoo! Then there was magic in the emeralds. This horse was
  undoubtedly the King's wish come true, a beastly wish!" shuddered the
  merchant as he stared in fascination at the pawing monster and wondered
  what to do next. He was afraid to run past the white horse and escape with
  the jewels, but HAH! he could make a wish for himself, a wish that would
  carry him and the emeralds far from Skampavia, the farther the better.
  Closing his eyes, he muttered a hurried sentence and waited tensely to be
  transported to Ev, a country he had once visited in his youth. But nothing
  at all happened, and gritting his teeth with vexation, Matiah opened his
  eyes just as Skamperoo finished counting a hundred.

 "So!" beamed the delighted monarch heartily. "You have done it. You really
  are a magician. Behold my horse, a horse in a thousand. A golden-maned
  charger fit for a King, for a Conqueror"
 "Of all the dumb things," fumed Matiah, wriggling fiercely away from
  Skamperoo, "of all the dumb things to wish for, a horse is about the
  dumbest of all!"
 "Dumb?" whinnied the white steed with an indignant snort.
 "I'm not a dumb beast, I can laugh, I can talk,
 That's becoz I'm from Oz, and my full name is Chalk."
 "Cha-lk?" quavered Skamperoo, who had never heard an animal speak a word in
  his life. "He he says his name's Chalk." The King looked appealingly at
  the merchant, and seeing he would have to live up to the role of magician,
  Matiah assumed an air of careless superiority.
 "Well, he doubtless knows his own name, your Majesty. If he says his name is
  Chalk, it probably is Chalk, and the reason he can talk is because he comes
  from Oz, land of the magic necklaces, where all animals speak as well as we
  do."
 "Better," sniffed Chalk. Then, taking a experimental nibble at the cactus,
  he gave a terrific squeal of pain and displeasure flung up his heels
  and began to race around the garden at such a furious pace, Matiah and the
  King jumped behind the bench and cowered miserably against the wall.
 "Well, there you are!" panted the merchant angrily. "You have your horse,
  and what now? He's yours, you know, and you'll have to control him." Matiah
  ducked behind the King as Chalk thundered past, covering them both with
  dust and sand. "If you ask me, you simply wasted a wish. Why, you might
  have wished yourself a ton of emeralds, or a Kingdom ten times as large and

  prosperous as Skampavia, or"
 "But there's plenty of time for that," sputtered Skamperoo, holding
  desperately to the bench, "since you are a magician, you can grant all of
  my wishes."
 "Oh no, no indeed!" Matiah spoke hastily, remembering the way the emeralds
  had failed to grant his wish. "I can grant only one wish a week," he
  explained breathlessly, "and I trust next time you will think before you
  wish. Whoa, there, you Ozian brute! You silly monster. Stop that! Whoa! Ho!
  Whoa, I tell you!"
 "Are you my master?" Leaping lightly over the cactus, Chalk came to a sudden
  halt before the bench.
 "No, this King is your master," answered Matiah thankfully enough. "Speak to
  him, Skamper," he urged in a lower voice as Chalk reared curiously up on
  his hind legs to have a good look at the King.
 "Be behave yourself," commanded Skamperoo tearfully. "How do you expect
  me to ride on your back if you act like this?"
 "Ah, so you expect to ride me?" Chalk came down with a thud and grinned
  broadly at his new master. If you have never seen a horse grin, you have no
  idea how upsetting it can be. "Well, I suppose I shall have to put up with
  you," he neighed finally. "Just call a groom or servant, old Rub-atub, and
  see that I'm served my evening oats, three apples, and a measure of corn."
 "Certainly, certainly," agreed the King, starting off on trembling legs.
 "Well, I must say this is splendid, splendid!" protested Matiah, hurrying
  nervously after the King. (He was afraid to stay in the garden with Chalk.)
  "Where do you expect to get taking orders from a horse?"

 "I suppose you'd prefer me to take them from you!" puffed Skamperoo,
  beginning to grow a little angry himself. "Here, GIVE me my necklaces."
  Snatching the emeralds from the merchant's neck, he went charging into the
  palace hardly knowing whether to be glad or sorry for the sudden change in
  his fortunes.
 But by the time he reached the throne room, he had calmed down considerably.
  Seating himself hurriedly on his throne, he pondered how he could keep all
  these strange occurrences from Pinny Penny. He felt sure Pinny Penny would
  never approve of magic necklaces or a talking horse. Well now, he'd just
  tell his meddlesome Prime Minister that the stamping, snorting steed in the
  garden belonged to Matiah and must be fed and stabled. When he made another
  wish and he had a whole week to think about that when he made
  another wish he would be careful to wish for everything he needed. As for
  this whiskery wizard, he would flatter him along until he discovered the
  right magic to use with the emeralds. Then he would wish him away like
  that. Like THAT! Snapping his fingers spitefully, Skamperoo pulled the long
  bell cord that summoned Pinny Penny. His Royal Charger should be fed. Not
  many monarchs had a talking horse with a golden mane. Aho, but he was
  coming on! He'd show Pinny Penny yet what a smart ruler he was!
 Now Matiah, following the King slowly into the palace, had done some
  reflecting, too. He resolved not to lose his temper again with this
  provoking simpleton of a sovereign. He would simply humor him along, and
  before the week was out he would have another chance to steal the necklaces
  and escape to some far country. There at his leisure he would experiment
  until he discovered the right way to use them. He could not understand why
  the King had got his wish and his own wish had gone for nothing. What was

  the secret of the magic emeralds? With his forehead still wrinkled in
  thought, Matiah entered the throne room and quietly seated himself in a
  chair opposite Skamperoo. Much to his relief, the King neither reproached
  nor upbraided him.
 "As, so there you are!" he cried in his best meant-to-be-cheerful voice. "I
  have just sent Pinny Penny to feed your horse."
 "My horse?" barked Matiah, starting up in dismay. Then, catching a
  meaning wink from the King, he quickly winked back.
 "It seemed wisest," murmured Skamperoo, "to say nothing of your magic powers
  for the present. All this will be OUR secret," he finished playfully.
 "Oh, yes, yes, indubitably!" While Skamperoo was still wondering what
  "indubitably" meant, Matiah hurried out of the room and took a long drink
  of water from the old-fashioned fountain in the hall. "OUR secret!" he
  repeated bitterly to himself. "Our secret, indeed!"
  
 CHAPTER 3
 MORE ABOUT THE EMERALDS
 Skamperoo had not slept a wink. He tossed from side to side of the royal
  bed, his head simply buzzing with enchanting plans for the future. With the
  magic emeralds he could have everything he desired, and his desires and
  wishes were multiplying so rapidly he scarcely knew where to begin or what
  to wish for first. The necklaces pressed uncomfortably against his throat,
  but he would not take them off. He was so weary he ached in every bone, but
  still he could not stop thinking, and just as the castle clock tolled
  seven, the very thing he should wish for first came suddenly to him.

 Ah, that was it. Too bad he had to wait a whole week, but a week would pass,
  and perhaps during that time he would discover for himself the magic secret
  of his sparkling new treasures. Then he could be his own magician and put
  that meddlesome merchant in his place. As he was running over in his mind
  possible places to send Matiah, the door of his room opened cautiously, and
  Pinny Penny stuck in his head.
 "Well! Well? And did I ring?" grunted Skamperoo fretfully. "This is a fine
  time to awaken an Emperor."
 "Emperor?" exclaimed Pinny Penny, coming all the way into the room and
  closing the door. "Since when has Skampavia's King become an Emperor?"
 "Oh, go away and don't bother me." Turning his back on Pinny Penny, the King
  thumped his pillow and closed his eyes as tightly as he could.
 "It's all about the horse," whispered Pinny Penny, coming around to the
  other side of the bed. "A strange and magnificent animal for a mere
  merchant, if I may be permitted to say so. Not only that, it TALKS. It's
  ordering the stable boys around in a shocking manner, and it even told ME
  to mind my own business."
 "Well, why don't you?" suggested Skamperoo, rolling over on his back. "Of
  course he talks, Pinny; he's an Oz horse, and all animals from Oz talk. I
  thought you knew that."
 "Well, if this merchant has a talking horse, he is not so poor as he
  pretends," persisted Pinny Penny, shaking his finger under the King's nose.
  "My advice is to set the fellow on his horse and send him about his
  business as quickly as possible. I don't like his looks, Skamper. He's mean
  and mischievous, and mark my words, no good will come of him or his
  necklaces."

 "I don't like his looks any better than you," agreed the King, clasping his
  fat hands on his stomach. "But if I keep the emeralds, I must keep the
  merchant, and besides, I've a notion I could ride that talking horse
  myself."
 "Oh, good goats and gravy! Then I'd best go and lay in a supply of splints
  and liniment." Pushing his specs up on his forehead, Pinny Penny cast a
  disgusted glance at his huge reclining master and rushed hurriedly from the
  royal presence.
 Now Matiah, as you can well imagine, had slept no better than the King. In
  the small room to which Pinny Penny had taken him, he paced restlessly up
  and down. After all, he knew only two facts about the magic emeralds, the
  first that they really could, under certain conditions, grant wishes; the
  second, that they must not be worn by the person making the wish. This much
  the merchant had reasoned out for himself.
 As the King had got his wish while he, Matiah, was wearing the necklaces,
  and he himself had not got the wish he made with the emeralds around his
  own throat, that much seemed certain. Snapping his fingers joyfully and
  feeling sure the King was now wearing the jeweled chains, Matiah made a
  second wish, counting slowly to a hundred. But the hearty supper he had
  ordered as a test failed to appear, and flinging himself down on the bed,
  he began to rack his brains for some other solution to the mystery. Perhaps
  the magic power rested in a single stone which he had luckily touched as
  the King made his wish.
 Holding his head with both hands, he tried to remember exactly what he had
  done as Skamperoo began to count. But it was no use. He could not recall a

  single thing after he had started to run across the garden. And how,
  concluded the infuriated fellow, was he ever to discover the way to use the
  emeralds without arousing the King's suspicions or revealing the fact that
  he knew no more about them than Skamperoo himself? Muttering with vexation,
  he kicked a footstool all the way across the room and sat staring morosely
  at the worn carpet. The short, uneasy nap he finally got before morning did
  him no good, and cross and jumpy as a cougar, he made his way to the dingy
  dining hall of the palace.
 The King had already breakfasted, and looking out of the window, Matiah saw
  a terrified servant leading the Talking Horse around the courtyard,
  Skamperoo following at a safe distance. The sight of the stamping white
  charger made Matiah shudder anew. What a waste! he reflected bitterly, and
  if the King grew fond of the saucy monster, it would make his own task even
  more difficult, for until he succeeded in stealing the necklaces Matiah did
  not intend to let Skamperoo out of his sight. Gulping down the weak coffee
  and cold eggs a shabby servant grudgingly placed before him, he hastened
  outside. "Good morning, your Majesty!" he called out heartily. "And may I
  have a word with your Royal Highness?"
 "What kind of a word?" snickered Chalk, rolling his yellow eyes roguishly
  round at the merchant. "Give him a word, old Rub-atub, if that's all he
  wants. The right word for him, I should way, would be `GO!' or `NO!' and
  then we all could be happy."
 "It is about the necklaces," confided Matiah, ignoring the horse utterly and
  falling uneasily into step with the King. "They must be cleaned every day
  to keep them in good wishing condition."
 "But I was just going for a ride," objected Skamperoo with a little frown.

  "Won't this afternoon do?"
 "No, NOW is the proper time," answered Matiah impressively, thinking how
  clever he was to have invented this ruse to get hold of the emeralds. "If
  your Majesty will just give them to me, I'll polish them up while you are
  er exercising."
 "No, no, er That is, I'd better come and help you," Skamperoo spoke
  quickly. "I can ride this afternoon."
 "You think so?" With an exuberant prance, Chalk rose on his hind legs and
  spun around like a pinwheel. "Well, see you later, old Sos!" And with the
  terrified stable boy hanging onto his bridle, he went galloping off to the
  stable.
 "If you take my advice, you'll have that creature knocked on the head," said
  Matiah savagely. "Surely you won't endanger our lives by riding on his
  back."
 "OUR lives!" exclaimed Skamperoo, looking at Matiah in surprise. "You do not
  have to ride him; in fact, he's really my horse," he stated jealously.
 "So long as your Majesty wears the magic necklaces I must go wherever you go
  and do whatever you do!" explained the merchant loftily.
 "How How very awkward!" In spite of himself, Skamperoo groaned as he
  thought how tiresome it would be with Matiah trailing after him from
  morning to night. "I should think a magician like yourself could arrange
  things more sensibly."
 "But consider what is at stake," Matiah reminded him earnestly. "Together we
  can have and do anything we wish. Is that not worth a little
  inconvenience?"

 "Yes, yes, I suppose so. But if we are to do everything together, I think I
  should know the magic wishing formula as well as you." Skamperoo looked
  defiantly up at his newest advisor.
 "That is impossible." Striding stiffly along, Matiah shook his head. "The
  incantation once revealed becomes powerless. Only one versed in magic is
  permitted to use the emeralds. Have you thought at all about your next
  wish?" he asked, anxious to direct the King's mind into more cheerful
  channels. "We should plan and consult about it together, you know. But wait
  until we are in your Majesty's throne room," he added quickly as Skamperoo
  began to open and shut his mouth like a fish without saying anything.
  "While I am cleaning the necklaces, we can talk it over, yes?" Matiah's
  fingers fairly itched for the sparkling jewels, but restraining a mad
  impulse to snatch them from the King's throat, he walked along quietly
  beside Skamperoo talking so calmly and convincingly that he soon had the
  Skampavian monarch not only willing but anxious to reveal the wish that had
  kept him awake most of the night.
 First assuring himself that they were alone and locking the door so they
  would not be disturbed, the King seated himself at a small table. Matiah
  drew up a chair opposite and held out his hand for the necklaces.
  Reluctantly, Skamperoo handed them over, keeping a jealous eye on the
  jewels as the merchant began polishing them with a small square of silk he
  had taken from his pocket.
 As he rubbed the silk over the emeralds, Matiah carefully examined each one
  for some mark or sign that would give him a clue to their magic power.
  Intent as he was upon this task, a few low-spoken words of Skamperoo made
  him sit suddenly erect and regard the King with new respect and attention.

  How in thunderation, thought Matiah wonderingly, has this fat, silly
  monarch ever managed to hit upon such a magnificent and breathtaking wish,
  and as Skamperoo explained and elaborated upon his plan and schemes for the
  future, the merchant's interest grew apace. Quicker and cleverer than the
  King, he saw not only the possibilities of this splendid wish, but all the
  difficulties and problems that must be met and disposed of before it could
  reasonably be granted.
 Leaning forward, the emeralds for the moment forgotten, he put his mouth
  close to Skamperoo's ear. "There are three things that must be done before
  your wish can be realized." Matiah spoke tensely. "First...
  second... third..." After each short,
  whispered direction, Skamperoo nodded to show that he understood.
 "Then it will take four wishes to do it," he sighed, resting his elbows
  heavily on the table. "That will be four weeks, won't it?"
 "No, perhaps if we are careful we can work it all into one," answered Matiah
  thoughtfully, and taking up his bit of silk, he began polishing the
  emeralds with renewed vigor. The King, watching him, forgot his former
  dislike and distrust. Matiah's enthusiastic approval of his plans made him
  feel that perhaps he had misjudged this long-faced, whiskered stranger.
  Perhaps he would not wish him away, after all. He might prove very useful
  in the strange and magnificent future that stretched ahead.
 Matiah, on his part, had no such kindly intentions toward the King. He
  merely meant to make Skamperoo's wish his own, and so grand and daring was
  the prospect that he grew more impatient than ever to discover the way to
  accomplish it. Holding all three necklaces up to the light, he squinted at

  them anxiously. The chains seemed identical in every respect, but no
  what was this? One had a diamond clasp, while the clasps on the other two
  were of flattened emeralds. This, then, was the solution. The magic wishing
  power undoubtedly rested in the diamond clasp. Revealing in no way his
  satisfaction and elation over this important discovery, Matiah handed the
  necklaces back to the King.
 Somehow, decided the merchant, he must make Skamperoo touch the diamond
  clasp while he silently repeated the King's wish, but before that he needed
  a little time to prepare himself for the grand and glorious years that were
  to be his. As Skamperoo, exhausted by so much thinking early in the
  morning, waddled wearily over to his throne, Matiah strode to the
  bookshelves located in an adjoining room.
 "While your Majesty rests, I will have a look at this interesting library,"
  he murmured ingratiatingly, "and at the same time store up some useful
  information for the future." Skamperoo sleepily returned the merchant's
  broad wink, then, sinking back among his cushions, closed his eyes.
 >From his chair in the alcove, Matiah could keep the King in view, and
  satisfied that Skamperoo was really asleep, he began hurriedly turning over
  the pages of the large volume Pinny Penny had but that morning returned to
  the shelves. Soon he became so absorbed that he forgot all about the King.
  And that was a pity, for had he taken the trouble to look, he would have
  discovered that the King was no longer there..
  
 CHAPTER 4
 THE KING AND HIS TALKING HORSE
 Now it is true that the King had closed his eyes as Matiah settled himself

  in the alcove to read, but he was very far from asleep. In fact, no more
  than five minutes had been ticked away by the old-fashioned clock in the
  corner before Skamperoo straightened up as if suddenly struck by lightning.
  Casting a cautious look at the quiet merchant, he began to slide rapidly
  toward the door. Opening it without a sound, he slipped out into the
  corridor and, closing it just as softly, went puffing away to the quarters
  of the White Wishing Horse at the back of the courtyard. Though usually
  unenterprising and dull, we must credit Skamperoo with one brilliant idea.
  As Chalk had been brought to Skampavia by the magic emeralds, why should he
  not know the trick of using them? Fairly panting with eagerness and
  impatience, Skamperoo jerked open the door of the stable and stepped
  recklessly into Chalk's stall.
 "Ah, the little Kingaling!" whinnied Chalk, tossing his mane gaily. For some
  reason or other, he found his fat master tremendously amusing, and while he
  had an immediate desire to trample on Matiah and frighten off the stable
  boys, he felt only an affectionate tolerance for the tubby little ruler of
  Skampavia. "Have you come for your ride?" he inquired, giving the King a
  playful poke with his soft nose.
 "No, I've come to talk to you," wheezed Skamperoo, seating himself carefully
  on an overturned water bucket. "Quick, tell me all you know about these
  magic emeralds." Touching his three necklaces with a trembling forefinger,
  the King looked imploringly into the face of his new and powerful steed.
 "Humph!" Chalk shifted a mouthful of hay to his other cheek. "Well, as to
  that, or rather them, all that I know is nothing. You forget that I only
  came into existence yesterday afternoon."

 "Of course, of course! I was the one who wished you here," explained the
  King impatiently.
 "You wished me here?" mused Chalk, staring meditatively at the comical
  figure on the water bucket. "Well, I hardly know whether to thank you or to
  jump on you with all four feet. Even without any experience at all, I can
  see that this is no place for me."
 "You're right," sighed Skamperoo, clasping his knees dejectedly. "It's no
  place for me, either. That is why I must know about the emeralds. They can
  satisfy our every wish, and if we just knew how to use them, we could go
  away together."
 "You think you could manage that!" sniffed Chalk, who had his own opinion as
  to what would happen once the King mounted on his back.
 "Yes, together!" insisted Skamperoo. "Try to think," he begged earnestly.
  "You say you know nothing, then how did you know you came from Oz and your
  name and all that?"
 "That's right, how did I?" Putting one ear forward and one ear backward,
  Chalk swallowed his hay with a quick gulp. "There must be a lot of stuff in
  my head that I practically know nothing about," he reasoned thoughtfully.
  "Suppose you tell me exactly what happened, and then I'll tell you what I
  think of it." So, hunching forward, Skamperoo recounted the whole story of
  the merchant and the necklaces, how he and Matiah had retired to his
  private garden, how there, with the merchant wearing the emeralds, his
  first wish had been granted.
 "And a splendid wish it was, too," sighed Skamperoo, looking fondly up at
  his white horse. "Never forget that you were my first wish, fellow."
 "I'm hardly likely to forget myself," snickered Chalk loftily, "but attend

  closely, old Crown and Scepter, when I dropped down into that garden, yon
  whiskered merchant was running for the gate as if his life depended on it.
  He only stopped because he was afraid to pass me, and from the way he fell
  into those cactus bushes, I'll wager he was as astonished as you were that
  the emeralds had granted your wish." Chalk wrinkled his forehead shrewdly.
  "I don't believe he knows any more about the necklaces than we do. If he
  did, he would never have sent you one in the first place, and he would have
  granted all of his own wishes and been in some splendid other place.
  Matiah's a fraud!" finished the King's horse vehemently, "And he means to
  steal back the emeralds."
 "Of course! Of course! Oh! Oh! Why didn't I think of that myself? What shall
  we do now?" wailed Skamperoo, jumping up so quickly he overturned the
  bucket, for Chalk's frankly spoken opinion confirmed his own suspicions of
  the merchant.
 "Sit down," advised the white horse not unkindly. "I may not be a magician,
  but I have a little sense, and horse sense is what your Majesty needs more
  than anything else." As Skamperoo righted the bucket and meekly sat down
  again, Chalk closed his eyes, standing silent and motionless for so long
  the King though he had fallen into a trance. But just as he began to fidget
  nervously about on the uncomfortable edge of the bucket, the white horse
  opened his eyes and, flashing a triumphant smile at Skamperoo, began
  calling in a loud, lordly voice, "Boy! BOY! BOY!"
 While the King regarded him with mingled misgivings and admiration, Chalk
  snapped out directions to the clumsy little groom who came running in
  answer to his summons. When his mane and tail had been thoroughly brushed

  and he was decked out once more in the splendid saddle and trappings he had
  worn on his first appearance in Skampavia, he dismissed the groom with a
  haughty toss of his head.
 "Come!" he breathed mysteriously. "Climb up, Skamperoo, and we'll
  Skamperoodle before that rascally merchant even misses us. Have you decided
  upon the place we are to go?" he questioned curiously as the King made
  seven frantic efforts to put his foot in the golden stirrup. "Heh! Heh!
  Heh! The other foot, Master. How do you ever expect to mount that way?
  Stand on the bucket, Kingaling, catch hold of the saddle, and pull. It's
  easy as oats once you get the hang of it."
 "Is it?" Lying mournfully on his back where he had fallen after his last
  effort, Skamperoo gazed mournfully upward, and Chalk himself began to
  champ, snort and switch his tail with irritation.
 "You wished me on yourself and now it looks as if you would have to wish
  yourself on me," he muttered savagely. "Here, give me those necklaces
  hang them over my ear, and let's have done with this shameful exhibition."
 "You mean, if I wish myself upon your back I will really be there?" panted
  Skamperoo, bouncing up like a rubber ball. "You mean you have discovered
  the secret of the emeralds?"
 "Certainly!" The white horse regarded him scornfully through half-closed
  eyes, and the King, all too willing to be convinced, unclasped his three
  necklaces and, standing on tiptoe, hung them over Chalk's right ear.
 "I I wish to be upon this creature's back," puffed Skamperoo, his cheeks
  swelling out with suspense and importance. "One, two, three, four, five,
  six" and scarcely had he begun to count before he found himself
  firmly seated in the saddle.

 "Now, now, not another word," commanded Chalk sternly. "Before you dare to
  speak, take those emeralds off my ear." With shaking hands the King did as
  he was told, his heart pounding so violently it almost kicked a hole in his
  shirt.
 "That's right," directed the white horse more mildly. "Now suppose you tell
  me where you intend to wish us and what we do after that. Wishes are pretty
  quick, you know, and it is best to be prepared."
 "But but I cannot understand how you make them work," spluttered
  Skamperoo. "It's wonderful, it's marvelous. Do you understand what this
  means?"
 "Perfectly." Chalk rolled his eyes triumphantly round at his greedy little
  Master. "My head seems to be full of magic, which is not strange, seeing
  that I was magically brought into existence, and the trick of the
  necklaces, once I got to thinking about it, is quite simple. Now I am what
  I am a horse, and quite satisfied, but you with these emeralds may
  easily make a jackass of yourself, so you had better tell me what you wish
  before you wish it. For instance," he went on reprovingly, "if instead of
  wishing yourself upon my back you had wished yourself a good horseman, how
  much wiser that would have been. There's a lot more to riding than getting
  into the saddle, you know. But never mind that now. What was this great big
  wish you and Matiah were planning together?" Leaning so far forward he
  almost lost his balance, Skamperoo hurriedly whispered into Chalk's left
  ear his grand and glorious wish for the future, being careful to add to his
  own wish the three crafty suggestions made by the clever merchant.
 "You are sure this is what you desire?" Chalk looked sharply and a little

  sadly at the rotund and royal figure on his back. "You mean to go away and
  leave your own people without a thought or care? Isn't there anyone here
  you would like to take along or give a share of your good fortune?" The
  King shook his head violently.
 "I might make a wish for Pinny Penny," he added rather sheepishly.
 "Good idea," sniffed Chalk. "What are you going to give old Skinny Pins? You
  know, I rather like that old codger." Without delay and a bit spitefully,
  the King told him, and as this time Chalk found no fault with the wish,
  Skamperoo again placed the emeralds over Chalk's ear and quickly spoke nine
  words. Then, without waiting to see whether Pinny Penny got his wish, Chalk
  again took command.
 "If you do exactly as I say, we'll get off before Matiah discovers you are
  gone and comes down here to slice off your head to get his necklaces," said
  the white horse severely. Lowering his voice to a whisper, he slowly
  enunciated four brief sentences. Tingling partly with fright and partly
  with anticipation, Skamperoo repeated the four sentences after Chalk and
  began his counting. But stars! Scarcely had he reached ten before he felt a
  great lift and lurch, had just time to snatch back his emeralds and seize
  the reins before he and the huge white wishing horse, without leaving even
  a rustle in the quiet air, had gone, vanished and completely disappeared
  from Skampavia.
  
 CHAPTER 5
 A GREAT CELEBRATION IN OZ
 "Why all the crown jewels, old Toz?" Resting his chin on the window ledge,
  Highboy looked inquiringly into the dressing room of Joe King, ruler of the

  Gillikens and all of the purple countries of Oz. The King's apartment was
  on the tenth floor of the royal palace, but this made no difference to
  Highboy, for Highboy was a giant horse whose telescope legs could be raised
  or lowered to any level, making him one of the most amazing and amusing
  animals in Oz. "I say, are we going anywhere in particular?" he drawled
  curiously as the King, decked out in his best braided traveling coat and
  amethyst crown, surveyed himself cheerfully in the long mirror.
 "WE!" chuckled the merry monarch, turning round with a hearty roar. "Ho, Ho,
  HO! And how do you know YOU are going?"
 "Well, I see you are wearing your best purple boots, and when the King of
  all the Gillikens wears his best purple boots, he usually rides his best
  purple horse, does he not?"
 "Right," admitted the King good naturedly, "and I might as well tell you at
  once that we are going to the capital at the express invitation of her
  Imperial Highness, Queen Ozma of Oz!" The King cleared his throat
  importantly. "There is to be an immense festival to celebrate the discovery
  of Oz by mortals, the honors to be equally divided between the famous
  Wizard who arrived here in a balloon from Omaha many years ago and little
  Dorothy, who came by way of a Kansas cyclone somewhat later. Not only will
  the rulers of all four Oz Kingdoms be present, but many other important and
  Royal personages as well."
 "Well? Well, indeed!" trumpeted the giant horse shrilly. "There you stand
  all shined up like a doorknob and never a word to me. How'll I look? Why
  wasn't I told before? When do we start?"
 "Just as soon as her Majesty decides what to wear and what to take with

  her," answered the King with a solemn wink.
 "Oh, then I'll have bushels of time." Highboy sighed heavily with relief.
  "So we're invited to the Emerald City, eh? How perfectly perf, how simply
  magnif. Billy! Tommy! JIM!" As he called the name of each little groom,
  Highboy let himself down a couple of stories, and by the time he reached a
  usual horse height and level on the ground, he had ordered himself a bath,
  a mane wave, an oil shampoo and a hooficure. Indeed, Highboy's plans for
  the party went on apace and with the three grooms pattering after him with
  buckets, brushes and sponges, he trotted anxiously up and down his great,
  airy stable picking out his most splendid saddle and bridle and
  silver-braided blanket for the journey. The giant horse wished to make an
  impression that would uphold if not enhance the honor and reputation of the
  Gillikens. He was eager to renew his friendship with Trot, a little mortal
  girl who lived in the palace and with Herby, the Medicine Man, and the many
  other interesting characters he had met on a former visit to the capital.
 In the Munchkin, Quadling, and Winkie Kingdoms there was also a lively
  bustle and stir of preparation, and in many of the lesser Kingdoms the
  Kings, Queens and Potentates made ready for the great spring festival in
  the Emerald City. And you can imagine the fun and excitement in the capital
  itself. Everyone had some special part in the program; even the dogs and
  cats ran importantly about on countless errands like small messengers,
  their ears and tails quivering with interest and expectancy. After the
  visitors had been officially welcomed at the gates of the city, there was
  to be an imperial procession with bands, floats and favors for everybody.
  Then there were to be games, races, and other exciting athletic events and
  a grand banquet in the Royal Palace. A magic-lantern ball in Ozma's garden

  would complete the festivities for the first day. For the second, pageants
  and tableaux depicting the important and historical events of Ozian history
  had been arranged for the morning. Notta Bit More, a circus clown who had
  come to Oz from Philadelphia, was putting on an outdoor circus in the
  afternoon, helped by Bob Up, the orphan who had come with him, and all the
  famous animals in the Emerald City. From the squeals, shouts, and hilarious
  chuckles issuing from the huge white tent set just beyond the city wall, it
  promised to be an unqualified success.
 After the circus, Ozma had planned a picnic supper on the banks of the
  Winkie River, to be followed by demonstrations in magic by the Wizard of Oz
  and Glinda, the Good Sorceress of the South, and last, but not least, a
  lavish display of fireworks sent especially for the grand occasion by Happy
  Toko, Emperor of the Silver Isles. No wonder the children in the Emerald
  City could think of nothing but the coming celebration. No wonder Dorothy,
  Trot, and Bettsy (sic) Bobbin, the little mortals who lived in the great
  palace and were Princesses in their own right, were too busy to think of
  their titles or bother with their crowns. Dorothy, the first of the three
  to reach the capital, was Ozma's favorite companion, and Dorothy was
  perhaps the busiest of all. Not only had she planned all the tableaux and
  pageants, but had entire charge of decorating the palace and the Emerald
  City as well. The Scarecrow, whom Dorothy had discovered on her earliest
  trip to Oz, was her most willing and tireless assistant. This lively
  straw-stuffed gentleman had brains given him by the Wizard and was in high
  favor and constant demand because of his natural cheerfulness and amiable
  disposition.

 At the moment, he and Dorothy were superintending the erection of a floral
  arch over the great jeweled gates of the City. This arch, grown and tended
  by the Wizard, was so magically compounded that as each visitor rode
  through the gateway, a ribbon-tied bouquet of fragrant spring flowers
  dropped lightly into his or her lap. Dorothy and the Scarecrow had tried it
  out to their complete delight and satisfaction, and now, clasping their
  large bouquets, watched three energetic little gardeners tie up the last
  tendrils of the magic vine to the gaily painted arbor.
 "You know," said Dorothy, peering over the flower tops at the Scarecrow, "I
  can hardly wait till tomorrow. To think we'll be seeing Sir Hokus and Ojo
  and Unk Nunkie and Urtha and Prince Tatters and all the others"
 "And they'll be seeing us, too, remember that," beamed the Scarecrow,
  closing one cotton eye. "And now, if you can manage for a few minutes
  without me, I had better go and study up on my speech of welcome."
 "Oh, are YOU making the speech of welcome? How grand! How thrilling!"
  Dorothy gazed admiringly up at her oldest friend in Oz.
 "Yes, and I'm also making the speech awarding medals to the Discoverers of
  our country," confided the Scarecrow, thrusting out his chin and striking
  an attitude. "How will you feel when I pin that medal on your chest, my
  girl?"
 "Well," sighed Dorothy, looking dreamily over her bouquet, "I couldn't feel
  any happier than I do now, but it certainly will be a great honor,
  Scarecrow."
 "A great honor! Well, I should snickerty wicker. But what if I forget my
  speech right in the middle of a word?" The Scarecrow pushed back his old
  blue hat and puckered up his forehead anxiously. "How will I feel with all

  those Kings and Queens staring right at me? Really, I think Ozma had better
  have someone else make the speeches."
 "Oh, go along with you," laughed Dorothy, giving him a little push. "Haven't
  you magic brains? You'll be a splendid speechmaker."
 "Do you think so? Well, I'll do my best." Somewhat reassured, the Scarecrow
  patted Dorothy on the shoulder and started off through the park. Dorothy
  could tell from the way he flung his arms about that he was rehearsing, and
  with an amused little smile she hurried back to the palace to put the
  finishing touches to the decorations for Ozma's throne room. Halfway there,
  she met the Hungry Tiger carrying a large basket in his teeth and followed
  by ten little kitchen boys, also bearing enormous baskets.
 "Good gracious, Tige, what's this?" Dorothy stared at the little procession
  in surprise. The Hungry Tiger and Cowardly Lion have lived in the Emerald
  City almost as long as Dorothy, and though the tiger's appetite is
  tremendous and he is always threatening to eat a fat baby, he has never yet
  done it and is tame as Dorothy's pet kitten Eureka.
 "Oh, hadn't you heard?" The Hungry Tiger set down his basket and smoothed
  back his whiskers complacently. "I'm the head of the reception committee
  for all visiting animals and am on my way now to buy refreshments for the
  great banquet and picnic. And trust me," he gave Dorothy a broad wink, "to
  do it right. Just let me see that list, Kapo." Taking a long slip from the
  first Kitchen boy, he began to drone off the names of the capital's famous
  four-footed citizens and then the list of visitors.
 "Of course there must be meat for the Cowardly Lion and myself," mused the
  Tiger, blinking his eyes sleepily. "Then there's Hank, Bettsy Bobbin's

  Mule, and Doubty, that dromedary you and Sir Hokus brought back from one of
  those strange journeys, and we musn't forget Peter's Iffin, though he
  doesn't eat much. Put down a box of violets and geraniums for the Iffin,
  Kapo, my lad. Ozma's Saw Horse and the Woozy, being of wood, don't care for
  food, but that fine pink pig Pigasus eats enough for a dozen horses, and
  Toto, your little dog, and Billina must be taken care of, too, and Scraps'
  bear Grumpy."
 "Of course," agreed Dorothy, leaning her elbow on the Tiger's back so she
  could read the list over his shoulder. "But they all live here. Who's
  coming from foreign parts, Tiger?"
 "Well," confided the Tiger, "you'll be glad to know our old friend the
  Comfortable Camel is making the trip with Hokus I mean the Yellow
  Knight and Marygolden, the Princess he married, is riding a warhorse
  named Stampedro. The King and Queen of the Gillikens will make the trip on
  the Giant Horse (quite a lot of horses, aren't there?), and I hope Highboy
  keeps his legs in bounds. It makes me nervous to see a creature one height
  one minute and another height the next. You knew the Prince of Pumperdink
  was bringing Kabumpo, the Elegant Elephant?"
 "Don't you mean that Kabumpo is bringing him?" put in Dorothy mischievously.
  "And won't you be glad to see him again?"
 "Yes, I'll be glad enough to see him," murmured the Tiger, "but feeding him
  is quite a big problem."
 "Well, you're just the one to do it," said Dorothy, smoothing away the
  wrinkle between the Tiger's pointed ears. "You have such a big appetite
  yourself, you'd know just how hungry an elephant would feel. I see you've
  got Roger down, too."

 "I'm pretty sure King Ato will bring his Read Bird, so I'm ordering a dozen
  boxes of animal crackers for Roger and a barrel of apples for Snufferbux."
 "I wonder if he'll dance for us." Dorothy's eyes brightened, for she had
  taken a great fancy to the faithful bear with whom Ojo had traveled all
  over Oz. "He's bound to be jolly and full of fun."
 "And hungry as a bear," sighed the Tiger with a worried frown. "But that is
  easy compared to a dragon. King Cheeriobed is bringing a dragon, and this
  dragon's on a diet of mustard and sulphur think of that, my child
  and SAY, I'd best get along, or I'll never get my marketing done."
 "And I must go, too," said Dorothy, reminded of her many responsibilities.
  So, giving the Tiger's ear an affectionate pull, she ran all the way back
  to the palace. In the throne room she found Ozma and Tik Tok in a quiet
  conference.
 "I've made Tik Tok Master of Ceremonies," said Ozma, looking up with a smile
  of welcome, "because he never forgets what he's wound up to remember."
 "And I'll be sure to keep him wound up," promised Dorothy, patting the
  machine man on his copper shoulder. Tik Tok was another of Dorothy's
  discoveries and had been manufactured by a magician to be a slave of the
  King of Ev, but here he was, thanks to Dorothy, enjoying a life of interest
  and ease in the capital. Tik Tok could talk, think, and move about as well
  as anyone when he was wound, and was much more reliable and tireless than a
  real person.
 "I am to an-nounce the vis-i-tors as they en-ter the pal-ace and
  per-son-al-ly con-duct them to their roy-al quar-ters," Tik Tok told
  Dorothy in his slow and precise manner. "Oz-ma can de-pend on me

  ab-so-lute-ly, and ev-e-ry-thing will go like clock-work." With two stiff
  bows and ticking with importance, the metal man marched proudly from the
  room.
 "Like clockwork. Ha, ha! Did you hear that, and why not, with a clockwork
  man in charge? Oh, Ozma, doesn't it all look grand and gorgeous?" Clasping
  the little Queen around her slender waist, Dorothy gazed around the
  beautiful throne room. Every window and doorway was garlanded with flowers,
  while hundreds of palms, ferns, and fluttering silk pennants gave it an
  unwonted look of pomp and ceremony. "Let me see," mused Dorothy,
  straightening the folds of a white satin curtain. "I'm to stand on your
  right, Bettsy Bobbin and Trot on your left, and the Patchwork Girl is to
  hold your train at the grand reception. Do you think you can trust her,
  Ozma? She'll probably try to jump rope or wave it like a handkerchief."
 "Oh, Scraps is pretty good, considering her giddy make-up," observed Ozma
  with a little smile, "and she would be so disappointed not to be with us.
  I'm sure I can trust her at least for a little while."
 "Trust me? Trust me? You disgust me," shouted a merry voice, and Scraps, who
  had been peeking through the curtains at the back of the room, took a long,
  running slide, landing in an unladylike heap at the foot of the dais
  leading to the throne. Scraps, made from an old crazy quilt and stuffed
  with cotton, had been brought to life by a magician to serve his wife, but
  the Patch Work Girl had come to the Emerald City with Ojo and never
  returned to her creators, scorning the humble career of a maid servant. She
  was so gay and amusing, Ozma had allowed her to remain at the palace.
 "Must I go in training to hold a train?" she demanded, springing to her feet
  and striking so comical an attitude both Dorothy and Ozma had to laugh.

 "Of course not," said Ozma kindly, "just be careful and do not do any
  gymnastics during the reception."
 "Oh, I'll be careful and so dignified I'll probably split a seam, but wait
  till you see the grand-aerial-balance-defying stunt I'm to put on for the
  big show," puffed Scraps, snapping her button eyes boastfully. "I'm to walk
  the tightrope in Notta's circus, so SO long, girls, I must go and
  practice."
 "Well, even if she falls, it won't matter," remarked Dorothy with a slight
  shudder as the Patch Work Girl jumped recklessly out of the window and
  picking herself up set off for the circus grounds on the edge of the park.
 "Oh, Ozma, with all the interesting people here already and with all the
  grand and exciting ones who are coming, I believe we'll have the best time
  we've ever had since Oz was discovered."
 "Are you glad you discovered us?" Giving her an affectionate squeeze, Ozma
  linked her arm through Dorothy's. "Let's see how the Wizard is getting on
  with his tricks for the picnic."
 Dorothy nodded eagerly, and hand in hand the two girls hurried across the
  corridor to the laboratory of the wonderful Wizard of Oz.
  
 CHAPTER 6
 A STRANGE WARNING
 The first day of the grand celebration dawned clear and bright. The Emerald
  City had never seemed more sparkling or fair. Flags fluttered from every
  tower and turret of the palace; each house wore a garland of flowers and
  flaunted a dozen silken banners in the fresh spring breeze. The streets

  were alive with Ozma's subjects suitable costumed for the big parade, and
  when, shortly after noon, the Royal Visitors began to arrive, the castle
  bells broke into a joyous tolling, the hundred bands struck up the Oz
  National Anthem, and the magnificent and beautiful floats began to swing
  into line.
 The Scarecrow's address of welcome at the City Gates had been greeted with
  wild enthusiasm and applause, and now, happy but somewhat breathless, the
  indefatigable Straw Man mounted on the Saw Horse was leading the
  illustrious Guests into the City, where they were to join the Royal
  Procession and proceed in triumph to the West Gardens of the park. What
  shouts and cheers went up from the happy throngs as that impressive company
  in their glittering coaches or riding their favorite steeds moved
  majestically through the emerald-studded streets of the capital. Directly
  following the Scarecrow, all in red and wearing her tallest ruby crown, was
  Glinda the Good Sorceress of the South, her swan-drawn chariot seeming to
  float by itself. Marching cheerfully after the Ruler of the Quadlings came
  Nick Chopper, the Nickel-Plated Emperor of the Winkies, polished to the
  highest degree but democratically afoot, marching in the center of his ten
  splendid uniformed Winkie Guards. A few steps behind the Tin Woodman and
  prancing along in hardly restrained exuberance was the Giant Horse, proudly
  bearing Joe King and Queen Hyacinth, King and Queen of the Gillikens. And
  Highboy not only carried his own head high, but he had elevated his
  sovereigns above everyone else in the procession so that none could miss
  the happily smiling rulers of the North.
 A dazzling blue dragon had pulled the coach of King Cheeriobed, Queen Orin
  and Prince Philador all the way from Sapphire City, and an eye-filling

  sight was the Royal Family of the Munchkins. Kabumpo, the Elegant Elephant,
  resplendent in his jeweled robe, swayed haughtily along after Cheeriobed's
  blue coach, waving his trunk in a dignified way to this friends in the
  crowd. In the canopied seat on his back rode Prince Pompadore and Peg Amy
  of Pumperdink, easily the handsomest young couple in Oz.
 Peering mischievously out the side of his gaily painted jinrickisha was the
  merry Red Jinn himself, and no one could view the rotund little Wizard of
  Ev without feeling happier. Jinnicky's body was a great red jar. He wore
  the lid for a hat, and when he grew bored or sleepy he would simply retire
  into himself like a turtle. But now he did not feel at all like retiring
  and was showering ginger cookies right and left and simply beaming with
  interest and jollity. The King and Queen of Ragbad rolled briskly along in
  their shabby but comfortable open coach. With them were Prince Tatters,
  Urtha, his flowery little Princess, and Grandpa, an old Soldier with a
  wooden leg, who had gone through many wars and hardships for the sake of
  his country.
 But the shout that greeted the Yellow Knight was loudest and longest of all.
  The Prince of Corumbia had lived in the Emerald City for many years as Sir
  Hokus of Pokes before he was disenchanted and became the young and charming
  husband of Princess Marygolden of Corabia. Sir Hokus rode the Comfortable
  Camel, and Camy, who had also spent part of his life in the capital, came
  in for his full share of the cheering. Princess Marygolden was mounted on
  Stampedro, the Knight's great, stamping warhorse, and Stampedro was a sight
  to make any little boy's heart beat faster.
 Ato, King of the Octagon Isles, and Samuel Salt, a reformed Pirate now Royal

  Discoverer and Explorer for the Crown, traveled together in Ato's Octogon
  (sic) Chariot drawn by eight prancing black horses with eight footmen in
  eight-sided hats on the high seat behind his merry little Majesty. Roger,
  the Read Bird, perched proudly on the King's shoulder, reading out the
  signs and street names as they bowled merrily over the gold paving stones,
  and chuckling to himself in eight different languages.
 Last, but by no means least, came the King and Queen of Seebania, the King's
  uncle better known in the Emerald City as Unc Nunkie and the King's
  son, Ojo. The King and Queen were seated sedately in the Silver Coach of
  Seebania, but Ojo and his pet bear Snufferbux were proudly mounted on the
  back of Roganda, Queen of the Unicorns. This handsome, snow-white beast,
  who had happened to be visiting Ojo at the time, could not only send her
  horn darting out like a lance, but could blow it as well. The sound of its
  clear, bell-like notes made many a trumpeter in Ozma's band turn round with
  surprise and envy. Drawn up to meet her impressive visitors was Ozma
  herself. The Royal Float of Her Imperial Highness was formed like a
  seashell. On an uncut emerald in the center sat the little Ruler of all the
  Ozians dressed in a shimmering white robe, wearing her flashing emerald
  crown, and never in all the thousand years of her young life had this
  lovely young fairy looked more beautiful. Also in white were her
  attendants, Dorothy, Bettsy, and Trot, each wearing an emerald circlet and
  carrying a long wand draped with spring flowers.
 As the Scarecrow brought his bright cavalcade to a triumphant halt, Ozma's
  float, drawn by the Hungry Tiger and the Cowardly Lion, swung into place at
  the head of the line. The other Emerald City Floats, first waiting for the
  Royal Equipages and mounts of the visitors to pass, swept after them in a

  burst of music and color. The Wizard of Oz had chosen a huge, revolving,
  green ball on which the nimble little necromancer ably kept his balance as
  he propelled himself along. After him came Jack Pumpkinhead, riding the
  Iffin. Herby, the Medicine Man, clinging precariously to the Doubtful
  Dromedary's hump, the pills and boxes in his medicine chest rattling like
  castanets, was another figure of interest. The float of Notta Bit More
  represented a circus ring, and the antics of the clown, Pigasus, Bob Up,
  Scraps, Hank and Grumpy, the Patch Work Girl's bear, kept the onlookers in
  a gale of hilarity.
 Tik Tok had rigged up a mechanical handcar, which he operated himself.
  Benny, the live statue of a public Benefactor, who had come to Oz from
  Boston, strode solidly along, an expression of pride and deep satisfaction
  on his well-carved features. Beside Benny marched the Soldier with Green
  Whiskers, looking neither to the left nor right, as became a man who
  represented in his own person the whole and entire army of Oz. I have only
  mentioned the most outstanding of the Emerald City paraders. Besides these,
  there were countless marchers and hundreds of miniature castles, ships,
  huge make-believe sea serpents and dragons, and in a blaze of color and
  harmony they wound through the streets of the capital, ending up in the
  West Gardens of the palace, where the boys and girls from Professor
  Wogglebug's Athletic College distinguished themselves in a series of
  gymnastic displays, and the Scarecrow established an all-time record for
  pole vaulting.
 By the time Ozma had awarded the cups and trophies, the sun had begun to
  slip down behind the treetops, and in high spirits and with splendid

  appetites the Royal Party and the Royal Guests turned toward the castle.
  Here Tik Tok, who had hurried on ahead, nobly discharged his duties as
  Master of Ceremonies. The Cowardly Lion did the honors for the Four-Footed
  visitors, leading each to an airy, shower-equipped stall in the Royal
  Stable so they could rest and refresh themselves before the Grand Banquet.
  And how shall I do justice to that dazzling affair?
 For the first time in its history the magnificent Dining Hall was filled to
  capacity. Easily as large as a city park, there was just room for the two
  long, sparkling, flower-laden banquet tables, the first for Ozma's
  courtiers and guests, the second for the palace pets and visiting animals.
  The Scarecrow caused a roar of hilarity as the diners took their places by
  donning a pair of dark spectacles to prevent eyestrain from the flashing of
  so many jewels and crowns. With each course of the long, delicious dinner,
  Ozma had a different King, Queen or Celebrity at her side, and so cleverly
  had it all been arranged, each guest had the honor of sitting for a time
  beside the Kingdom's Little Fairy Ruler. Soft music floated down from the
  balcony where the Royal orchestra was concealed behind a bower of palms.
  The bright robes and jewels of the banqueters and the emerald and silver
  dinner service twinkled and sparkled in the magic glow of a thousand
  candles. The hundred footmen were swift and skillful, the speeches were
  short and merry, "And never," thought Dorothy, looking around with a little
  thrill of satisfaction, "never has there been so grand and yet delightful a
  party!"
 The Hungry Tiger had remembered the tastes and appetites of each of his
  guests, and not only were they served with the same dainties enjoyed by the
  Two-Footed visitors, but every one had a special dish of his own. Even the

  Dragon seemed to enjoy immensely his matches and mustard, then called in a
  hoarse voice for three pails of hot coals, after which he blew a whole
  series of smoke rings and went comfortably to sleep.
 Dorothy and the Wizard had with due modesty accepted their medals for their
  discovery of Oz, and the whole company on its feet for this impressive
  ceremony were suddenly startled by a shrill scream from the Patch Work
  Girl. "His beard! His beard! Look at his beard!" yodeled Scraps. (Yes, I
  think "yodel" best describes the excited noise made by this irrepressible
  maiden.) "His beard, I said, it's turning RED!" At the word "beard," every
  eye turned to the Soldier with Green Whiskers, for his beard was the
  longest and most celebrated in Oz.
 "Why, so it is!" exclaimed Dorothy in astonishment.
 "Red?" choked the Soldier, desperately clutching his famous whiskers. "Oh!
  Oh! My beautiful green beard, it's red as fire. Oh! Oh! How can I ever be
  the Soldier with Green Whiskers if my beard stays red? Who did this?
  Wizard! Wizard, are you playing a trick on me?"
 "Certainly not, Soldier. I'd be the last person to tamper with your sacred
  beard. Quiet, please! Quiet! This is extremely odd and disturbing." Jumping
  on his chair, the Little Wizard of Oz looked anxiously around the room.
 "Do they hurt? Are red whiskers painful?" asked Scraps while the Royal
  guests, hardly knowing whether to laugh or sympathize, gazed curiously at
  the blazing beard of the Army of Oz.
 "They they hurt my feelings," blubbered the poor Soldier, holding out
  his bristling red whiskers in disgust. "I'll never get used to a red beard.
  Never! Never!"

 "Why not cut it off?" inquired Prince Pompadore with some difficulty
  controlling his chuckles.
 "What? Cut off my beautiful whiskers? Why, why, I'd rather lose my head,"
  moaned the Soldier with a horrified shudder. "How would I look? How would I
  
  fight? Oh! Oh! This is ridiculous!" Burying his face in his napkin, Ozma's
  distracted army rushed violently from the room.
 "Red-iculous, if you ask me," observed the Scarecrow in his droll voice.
 "No, no, it's MAGIC!" muttered the Wizard, stepping briskly down from his
  chair. "Wait, I must consult my book of red magic and portents."
 "And I'll go with you," offered Jinnicky, rolling quickly out of his
  cushioned seat. "You know RED magic is my specialty." So, arm in arm, the
  Wizard of Oz and the Wizard of Ev bustled away together.
 "Well, I can tell you what it means without consulting any books," said the
  Scarecrow as Ozma, looking rather troubled, again took her place and
  motioned for the others to do the same. "It is a warning," declared the
  Scarecrow, raising his arm stiffly. "Someone is coming to beard us in our
  den (pardon such an informal reference to your castle, my dear)." He made
  an apologetic little bow to Ozma and then continued seriously, "A danger
  from without threatens the Kingdom of Oz."
 "Who would dare threaten the sovereignty of our country?" demanded the
  Yellow Knight, brandishing his sword.
 "What's up? What's up?" neighed Highboy, elevating himself so suddenly he
  cracked his head against the ceiling.
 "You should know, being so high," chuckled the Scarecrow, who could not
  resist a joke even when he was most serious. "But calm yourself, my good

  horse, you are not in danger yet." Danger! The short, ugly word dropped
  like a bomb into that gay and carefree assemblage. Dorothy, with a little
  pang of dismay, saw the Cowardly Lion creeping under the table, and feeling
  in her pocket for her handkerchief, drew out instead one of the Wizard's
  wishing pills. He had given it to her so she could visit the corn-ear
  palace of the Scarecrow the following week and do it by simply wishing
  herself there instead of making the journey. Dorothy fingered the pill
  thoughtfully for a minute or two, then with a sudden quick motion popped
  the small tablet into her mouth.
 "Whatever happens, help me to save Ozma and Oz," murmured Dorothy, and
  swallowing the pill, she looked sharply around the room for further signs
  of warning or disaster.
  
 CHAPTER 7
 WHAT WIZARD?
 At first, everything seemed as usual. Then, turning to ask the Tin Woodman a
  question, Dorothy was annoyed to discover that his chair was pushed back
  and he was nowhere in sight.
 "Oh, he's probably helping the Wizard," decided Dorothy, and had no sooner
  come to this comforting conclusion before she gave a second start of alarm.
  Glinda, the Good Sorceress, was no longer in her seat at the foot of the
  table, and running her eye hurriedly down the glittering board, Dorothy saw
  five more empty places. Pressing a finger to her forehead, Dorothy tried to
  remember who had been sitting in the five deserted chairs. Surely Joe King
  and Queen Hyacinth had been there between Bettsy Bobbin and Trot, while

  Prince Philador, Queen Orin and King Cheeriobed had been directly opposite.
 "Good Gillikens!" gasped the little girl, jumping quickly to her feet. "The
  rulers of all four Oz countries are gone, and Highboy's gone, too." And
  strangely enough, nobody seemed to have missed them. Instead, they were
  listening with broad smiles and appreciatively tapping toes to the loud and
  hilarious singing of the Patch Work Girl. Scraps, thinking it a shame to
  let a mere change of whiskers spoil a good party, was enlivening the
  company with her newest and most comical rhymes. So loud was her voice and
  the applause of the banqueters, Dorothy found it impossible to make herself
  heard, so running around to the back of the Scarecrow's chair, she tugged
  him anxiously by the arm. "Scarecrow! Scarecrow!" whispered Dorothy
  hoarsely. "Where are the Four Rulers of Oz, and whatever can be keeping the
  Wizard so long?" Tearing his gaze reluctantly from the Patch Work Girl, the
  Scarecrow looked dreamily over his shoulder.
 "WHAT WIZARD?" he inquired blankly.
 "THE Wizard, OUR Wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Oz." Dorothy stamped her
  foot and almost shouted with surprise and vexation.
 "Never heard of him," declared the Scarecrow, smiling blandly down at her.
  "Now, why not sit quietly down and listen to Scraps? She's never been
  funnier. Ha! Ha! Ha! Never funnier!" Dorothy was so stunned and dumbfounded
  by the Scarecrow's statement about the Wizard, she opened and closed her
  mouth several times without saying anything.
 "Mercy, I'd better tell Ozma about this," she thought distractedly, and
  swinging round abruptly, she scurried along back of the diners till she
  came to the head of the table. "Oh, Ozma!" panted the little girl
  breathlessly then stopped short. There was no one in Ozma's great

  dragon-armed chair of state. The Yellow Knight and Prince Pompadore, who
  for the last course were in the seats of honor beside the little Queen,
  leaned unconcernedly across her empty place engaged in a long, earnest
  argument about horses. They looked up in surprise as Dorothy, her crown by
  this time very much on the side, bounced suddenly between them. "Where's
  Ozma?" demanded the little girl, thumping her fist sharply on the table.
 "Ozma?" The Yellow Knight and Prince Pompa exchanged an uneasy glance. "Who
  is Ozma?" asked Prince Pompadore curiously.
 "Oh! Oh, I think you are all perfectly horrid. Stop joking! Stop teasing
  me!" cried Dorothy, and as both Princes in frank amazement jumped up to try
  to comfort her, she rushed angrily from the room. As she fled along the
  green corridor she could still hear Scraps singing and the shouts and
  cheers of her listeners. "This is terrible, terrible!" wailed Dorothy, and
  running blindly down the long hall, she burst through the swinging doors of
  the Wizard's laboratory. What she had expected to find, Dorothy hardly
  knew. Really, she was hoping to see Ozma and the four other rulers grouped
  around the Wizard's green table.
 But only a blank, suffocating silence answered her frantic calls for the
  Wizard. Frightened into silence herself, Dorothy tiptoed from one end of
  the other of the long, curiously appointed apartment, peering into
  cupboards, under sofas and back of screens. Where was the Red Jinn? Where
  was the Little Wizard of Oz? Not here, certainly. Not in the Banquet Hall.
  But the THRONE ROOM! THERE she would find all of her missing friends
  conferring with Ozma over the threatened danger to the realm. With a little
  gasp of relief, she darted across the corridor into the vast and

  magnificent Hall of Justice where Ozma received visitors, settled disputes,
  and carried on all the important business of governing.
 They were not in the sumptuous presence chamber, but at least the throne was
  not empty. No, no indeed! Dorothy looked once, rubbed her eyes, looked
  again, and then, giving a shrill scream of terror, flung both arms round
  one of the emerald-studded pillars. An immense white horse was sitting on
  the throne of Oz. A great, fat King was sitting on the horse, or rather
  clinging desperately to his neck. Dorothy knew he was a King by the crown
  perched ridiculously on the side of his head. That crown seemed oddly
  familiar, and after another horrified glance, Dorothy screamed again, for
  it was the splendid emerald circlet belonging to Ozma of Oz.
 Her screams seemed to rouse the two occupants of the throne, who, to be
  perfectly frank, looked as dazed and stupefied as Dorothy herself. "Go
  away!" sputtered the fat King, waving his arms irritably. "Go away, little
  girl, and don't bother me."
 "And kindly bow as you leave," directed the White Horse, lifting one foot
  sternly. "You are looking at the Emperor of Oz and his Imperial Charger."
  Bowing more from astonishment than intention, Dorothy backed a few steps,
  then turned round and ran madly toward the Royal Banquet Hall.
  
 CHAPTER 8
 WAY FOR THE EMPEROR!
 "Here, give her water! Give her air! Stand back, everybody. Now, then,
  what's the matter, child?" The Scarecrow bent solicitously over the little
  girl who had rushed into the banquet hall screaming hysterically about
  disappearances and white horses and fallen breathlessly into the chair

  beside him. "Come, tell uncle all about it," begged the Scarecrow, patting
  Dorothy clumsily on the head.
 "Tell you!" choked poor Dorothy, twisting her best handkerchief into a hard
  knot. "Do I have to tell you? Can't you see for yourselves that Ozma is
  missing, that the Wizard and Jinnicky are gone, that Glinda and the Tin
  Woodman, that the King and Queen of the Gillikens and the King and Queen of
  the Munchkins have vanished entirely? And yet here you sit, singing and
  laughing as if nothing at all had happened. Can't you understand that
  something dreadful has happened to Ozma and that a big, fat, funny-looking
  man and a white horse are sitting on the throne of Oz?"
 "Ozma, Ozma who's she?" murmured the banqueters, looking vaguely at
  Dorothy and then at each other.
 "She's feverish, that's what." Herby, the Medicine Man,20leaned over to
  touch Dorothy expertly on the forehead. "I'd advise you to go upstairs and
  lie down, my dear."
 "Yes, who don't you?" urged Bettsy Bobbin, coming over to put her arm around
  Dorothy's waist. "I'll go up with you and lend you my very best smelling
  salts."
 "Lie down, with that big, fat interloper on the throne of Oz?" wailed
  Dorothy. Squirming out of Bettsy's embrace, she started indignantly to her
  feet. "You must be crazy! Camy! Kabumpo! Snufferbux! Toto! You you'll
  believe me, won't you?" Hurrying over to the second table, Dorothy looked
  pleadingly down the long board from the Hungry Tiger at the head to the
  Cowardly Lion at the foot.
 "There, there," mumbled Kabumpo, lifting Dorothy up in his trunk. "don't go

  on so, my dear, we all have these little funny spells. Here, sit up on my
  back so you'll have a good view of the Emperor when he arrives. Hi, there
  he comes now! Ray! Ray! Way for Skamperoo, Emperor of Oz!" Waving Dorothy
  in his trunk as if she had been a flag, Kabumpo plopped down on his knees
  and banged his big head three times on the polished floor. From her
  precarious position Dorothy saw the same fat imposter who had been in the
  throne room riding his white charger pompously into the Banquet Hall, the
  horse nodding to the left and right and grinning like a Cheshire Cat.
 Cheers, bows and a loud burst of applause and music made his entry so noisy
  Dorothy's angry protests and cries were entirely drowned out. Disgusted,
  confused and completely bewildered by the behavior of Ozma's subjects and
  her own best friends, Dorothy jerked away from Kabumpo and darted through a
  long French window into the garden. What could it mean? What could have
  happened? Had all her former memories of Oz been a dream? No, no!
  Violently, Dorothy decided against such an idea. Rather was this fat
  emperor a dream, a maddening nightmare from which she would presently
  awaken. Leaning dizzily against a golden fawn set near a crystal garden
  pool, Dorothy tried to find some reasonable explanation of the whole
  dreadful mixup. And here, several minutes later, Pigasus, the winged Pig,
  found her.
 "Thought a little fly over the treetops might help your head," grunted
  Pigasus, looking unhappily down his pink snout. "Nothing like a little fly
  for a headache, my girl!"
 "My head's all right," answered Dorothy sullenly. "It's the rest of you who
  have lost your heads or your senses. How in Oz you could stand in there
  cheering that big, fat fraud I'll never, never understand. Piggins, Piggins

  dear" Dorothy bent coaxingly over him "surely you remember
  Ozma and the Wizard and Glinda." Instead of answering at once, Pigasus
  stared thoughtfully at his reflection in the pool.
 "Suppose you sit on my back, and then we can talk without being heard," he
  suggested brightly. "Up in the air we can air our views in safety, as it
  were."
 "To tell the truth, I don't much care where I go now," sighed Dorothy,
  seating herself disconsolately on the pig's broad back.
 "Hey, Hey, we're bewitched and enchanted, I knew it! With you on my back, I
  can think and see through it!" squealed Pigasus, and flapping his huge
  wings, he soared high over the flowering plum trees in Ozma's garden.
 "Of course Ozma's Queen, not this big Skamperoo. The Ruler of Oz and the
  whole royal crew
 Have been kidnapped, bewitched or put out of the way We'll fly off for
  help, and we'll start right away."
 "Oh, Piggins!" Dorothy threw both arms round the pig's neck and almost wept
  for joy:
 "Oh Pigasus, to think you remember them, too, But where have they gone? What
  in Oz shall we do?"
 "We'll find them, wherever they are they'll be found, But we'd best make our
  plans with our feet on the ground," muttered Pigasus, looking below for a
  likely spot to land.
 There was one disadvantage about Pigasus, though some did not regard it as
  such. Like the winged horse Pegasus, whoever caught him and rode on his
  back at once became a poet and unable to speak anything but rhymes. The

  poetic pig could not only tell what they were thinking, but he often spoke
  his own mind in verse as well. At times this grew terribly tiresome, but
  except for his jingles, a more cheerful, loyal, little fellow could not be
  found in the length or breadth of the country. Raised and bred by the Red
  Jinn, he had been given to the Duke of Dork. The Duke had given him to the
  Philadelphia boy Peter, who in the course of a voyage with Samuel Salt, the
  Pirate, had captured the Duke's splendid castle boat. The capture had been
  quite a social and friendly affair, and the Duke had traded Pigasus for a
  Bananny Goat. Peter had later brought the flying pig to the Emerald City,
  where he was petted and admired by the whole court. Now, slanting down into
  a quiet grove, Pigasus came to a gentle stop, and Dorothy tumbled off his
  back.
 "Oh, Pigasus, isn't it lucky you were in the Emerald City? Nobody else can
  remember Ozma or the others at all."
 "And I only remembered them because you sat on my back," confessed the pig,
  twitching his nose thoughtfully. "It was my thought-reading gift that did
  the trick, and I am more than ever convinced that we are under some
  mischievous spell or enchantment. What I don't understand, my dear, is how
  you yourself escaped or chanced to remember things as they were. You know,
  before I came out here, it seemed perfectly right and natural for that roly
  poly pudding of an Emperor to be sitting at the head of the table. I knew
  no more about Ozma or Glinda or my former master Jinnicky than a newborn
  baby. By the way, Jinnicky's gone too, isn't he?"
 "Yes," Dorothy shook her head sorrowfully, "and without him or the Wizard to
  help, we'll have a hard time, I guess. What shall we do first, Piggins?"
 "How about having a try at some of the Wizard's magic?" proposed the pink

  pig daringly. "Then we might look in Ozma's magic picture and ask it to
  show us where all of our missing friends are now."
 "Now why didn't I think of that myself?" cried Dorothy, and springing up she
  started off on a run.
 "Wait! Wait!" grunted Pigasus, pattering breathlessly after her. "Remember,
  we must be very careful, my dear. No questions about Ozma, no remarks that
  will arouse the anger of this scalawag Emperor, or we'll both be clapped in
  a dungeon. We must pretend that we have forgotten, too, and get away
  quietly later tonight."
 This seemed so sensible a plan, Dorothy readily agreed to it, and without
  attracting any attention at all they re-entered the palace and hurried
  immediately to Ozma's small sitting room. But if they expected the magic
  picture to solve their problem, they were soon doomed to disappointment.
  The picture was gone from its accustomed place, and the safe where Ozma
  kept her magic treasures and other valuables was wide open and quite empty.
  A quick search of the Wizard's laboratory proved equally discouraging. The
  Wizard's famous black bag was nowhere in sight, the little hanging closet
  where he stored his transformation powders and wishing pills was bare as
  the cupboard of old Mother Hubbard.
 "Whoever planned this thought of everything," wheezed Pigasus, sitting
  heavily back on his haunches. "There is nothing here for us, Dorothy. If I
  were you, I'd get a few things together, and we'll leave right away before
  anyone misses you." From the cheers, shouts and hilarious singing coming
  from the banquet hall it seemed probably that the celebration would go on
  for hours. No one in that gay and foolish company even thought of or missed

  the little girl and the pink pig stealing so quietly through the dim halls
  of the palace.
 "Ozma's palace," reflected Dorothy, looking resentfully over her shoulder;
  but now it seemed strange, alien and completely unfriendly. With a little
  shiver, Dorothy drew her cloak more closely about her and stepped
  resolutely out into the night. Pigasus pattered on ahead, snorting a bit
  from sheer nervousness.
 "Maybe we'd better fly," he grunted uneasily as Dorothy caught up with him.
  "It's safer, and it's faster, and the faster we get away from here, the
  better, I'm thinking."
 "I've been thinking, too," answered Dorothy in a low voice, "perhaps only
  the people in the Emerald City are under this forgetting spell, Pigasus;
  perhaps if we fly to the Winkie Country, the Winkies will remember their
  Emperor, the Tin Woodman, and will help us raise an army so we can come
  back, conquer this old Skamperoo, and make him tell where he has hidden all
  the proper rulers of Oz and the other celebrities."
 "That's the talk! That's the talk!" approved the pig, twinkling his little
  blue eyes joyfully. "Up with you, up with you, my girl, but remember, if
  you grow sleepy, let me know at once, so I can descend. If you fall asleep,
  you might fall off my back, and think how I'd feel then."
 "Think how I'd feel!" laughed Dorothy, her spirits lifting a little at
  the pink pig's comical conversation and enthusiastic seconding of her
  plans. Seating herself carefully on his plump back, she quickly gave the
  signal to start. Then up soared Pigasus, over the palace gardens, over the
  City Walls and away toward the East and the Yellow Lands of the Winkies.
 "Oh, I believe everything is going to be all right," thought Dorothy,

  settling herself cozily between his wings.
 "So do I," sniffed the pink pig, peering mischievously over his shoulder.
 "I forgot you could read all the thoughts, Goodness Gracious!
 Of those on your back, Do you mind it, Pigasus?"
 "Now when they're nice thoughts like yours," puffed the little pig in answer
  to Dorothy's surprised rhyme, and winking his eye jovially, he zoomed like
  a pink Zeppelin through the sky.
  
 CHAPTER 9
 THE JOURNEY BEGINS
 For several hours Pigasus flew without slackening his pace. Then, as several
  suspicious little yawns and sighs floated past his keen, upstanding ears,
  he solemnly slanted downward. If he had chosen it on purpose, he could not
  have found a more comfortable place for Dorothy to spend the night. They
  had already crossed the border and penetrated far into the Land of the
  Winkies and were now landing in the quiet garden of a prosperous Winkie
  farmer. Set in the center of a dancing bed of yellow daffodils and tulips
  stood a small summerhouse, and with Dorothy rubbing her eyes sleepily,
  Pigasus trotted briskly into the rustic cottage. The door was invitingly
  open, and the moon lit up its cozy one-roomed interior. Snorting with
  satisfaction, Pigasus pattered over to a broad couch piled high with yellow
  cushions, and rolling drowsily from his back, Dorothy burrowed contentedly
  into the center of them, falling asleep before the pig reached his own bed,
  a soft, woolly rug on the hearth.
 Pigasus slept lightly but well, and waking around six began to gaze rather

  anxiously at the round yellow farm buildings just visible from the door.
  The pink pig had had several unfortunate experiences with farmers. They had
  a way of looking at his plump body that seemed to reduce him at once to
  slices of bacon and sides of ham. One enterprising fellow had actually
  caught him and shut him up in an untidy pen. From this foolish prison
  Pigasus had escaped by spreading his wings and flying away, but the mere
  mention of farmer gave him the shivers.
 So now, moving impatiently about the little room, he waited for Dorothy to
  awaken, and as she continued to slumber on, he flew up over the mantel and
  swept a large yellow jug to the floor with his wing. The crash of the
  falling jar aroused Dorothy at once, and without stopping to explain,
  Pigasus suggested that they start off, and Dorothy, not even noticing the
  broken jug, readily consented.
 "We'll probably find a much better place to have breakfast as we fly along,"
  murmured Pigasus as Dorothy seated herself between his wings, holding her
  small basket of supplies in her lap.
 "Would it do any harm to stop at the farm And enquire about Ozma and spread
  the alarm?" asked Dorothy, who had rather counted on a cheerful breakfast
  at the farmhouse.
 "No, it wouldn't do any harm," answered Pigasus, rising in a straight line
  from the tulip bed and winging rapidly over the yellow fields and fences,
  "but neither would it do any good. Farmers never know what's happening or
  going to happen. I tell you, though, we'll ask the first person we meet."
 "Who would we meet in the air but a bird? Now really, Pigasus, that's simply
  absurd."
 "Some of the smartest people I know are birds," insisted the pig stoutly.

  "Take Roger, for instance. He knows more than most of have forgotten. But
  look! A brook, a quiet wood! Stop! Listen! Look! For I crave food!" Making
  a swift downward curve, Pigasus landed cleverly by a rippling stream edged
  by some tall butternut trees. There were yellow raspberries along the bank,
  and the berries, with some of the sandwiches Dorothy had brought with her,
  washed down by cool water from the brook, made a splendid breakfast.
 "I wonder whether they'll have the tableaux and pageant without me," sighed
  Dorothy, biting slowly into a sardine sandwich, "and how they manage the
  circus without you, Piggins, or the picnic supper without Ozma, or the
  magic and fireworks without the Wizard."
 "They've probably forgotten all about today's doings," mumbled Pigasus,
  nosing busily among the leaves for ripe butternuts. They'll probably spend
  the time bumping their noses on the floor when that fat Emperor comes
  waddling through the palace and bending the right knee every time his white
  horse sneezes or coughs. Pah!" Choking with indignation, Pigasus began
  gobbling up so many butternuts, Dorothy feared he would never be able to
  fly or walk again.
 "Let's stay on the ground for a while," she proposed, eyeing him rather
  nervously as she packed the remaining sandwiches neatly back in the basket.
  "I believe there's a path beyond those trees. Maybe it leads to a town or
  village where we may meet someone who can tell us what we want to know."
 "You don't expect to find out where Ozma and the others are hidden straight
  off, do you?" Rubbing his back lazily against one of the butternut trees,
  Pigasus looked quizzically at his earnest little companion.
 "No, I don't really expect that," said Dorothy, slipping the basket over her

  arm, "but it would be pretty nice if we met somebody who even remembered
  them after all we've been through."
 "I can hardly remember them myself unless you are sitting on my back,"
  admitted the pink pig, trotting soberly along at her side. "This Emperor's
  magic must be strong medicine. Hello! Here comes a fisherman." Pigasus
  pricked up both ears and his wings. "Shall I question him, or will you?"
 Without bothering to answer, Dorothy ran eagerly toward the tall Winkie who
  was coming leisurely along the path. He carried a basket and had a fishing
  rod over his shoulder, and though his clothes were rough, Dorothy could
  tell by his manner and bearing that he was a person of some importance.
 "Oh, please, Mr. Winkie," cried the little girl as he nodded politely and
  would have passed them without stopping, "could you tell us who is King
  here?"
 "King?" answered the fisherman, taking his pipe out of his mouth and looking
  kindly down at his small questioner. "Why, no one in particular, my dear,
  but of course we Winkies and the inhabitants of the three other countries
  of Oz are governed from the capital by Emperor Skamperoo, a great fellow,
  our Emp, and have you seen his white horse?"
 "Yes, I've seen it," said Dorothy, shutting her mouth rather grimly.
 "But I thought Ozma was Queen," wheezed Pigasus, out of breath from running
  after Dorothy and too many butternuts.
 "Ozma? What a curious name," mused the fisherman, looking pensively at the
  winged pig. "What gave you the idea that Ozma was our ruler? Perhaps you
  are strangers here."
 "Well, it would seem so," puffed Pigasus, sitting down and panting a little
  from sheer discouragement.

 "Oh, you'll get used to us," laughed the fisherman with a breezy wave. "Fine
  country, this; sorry I can't show you 'round, but as I've promised my wife
  some fish for dinner, I'll have to be moving along. Good day to you. Good
  day, little girl!"
 "Good day," echoed Dorothy in a rather flat voice as the fisherman, lifting
  his hat, strode briskly into the wood. "You see!" she groaned. "Even here
  everyone is bewitched. Oh, Piggins, what'll we do? No one in Oz will help
  or believe us."
 "Goose-tea and turnips! What if they don't!" Pigasus shook his head
  impatiently. "There are other countries, aren't there? Take Ev, for
  instance, or Rinkitink, or the Rose Kingdom. Why, there are lots of places
  whose rulers will remember Ozma, my poor old friend Jinnicky, and the
  others. Come along, my girl, we've only just started.
 "While people roar for the Emperor We'll seek our rightful ruler
 >From coast to coast, from door to door Though foes grow cruel and crueller!"
 "What we need is some magic," finished Pigasus shrewdly. "Know a good place
  to look for some?"
 "The Gnome King has plenty of magic," reflected Dorothy, leaning
  thoughtfully against a tree, and Ozma and I really helped put him on the
  throne, so surely he'll help us."
 "Well, maybe, but I don't set great store by gnomes. They're tricky;
  nevertheless, we'll go to Ev and everywhere else till we restore this
  country to its proper rulers." Pigasus looked so impressive with his chest
  and cheeks puffed out with purpose, Dorothy gave him a quick hug. "Down
  with the Emperor!" snorted Pigasus, though almost suffocated by Dorothy's

  embrace. "And up with you, my patriotic young Princess."
 "Now you make me feel like a real one. I'd almost forgotten I was a
  Princess," smiled Dorothy, climbing obediently on his back. "I believe
  everything will be better from now on."
 "Well, it could be a lot worse," chuckled Pigasus, and flapping his wings in
  a businesslike manner, he rose gracefully into the air and headed for the
  east. Rolling hills dotted with castles, villages and towns, valleys,
  farmlands and forests flashed in an ever-changing, pleasant panorama below.
  At noon they came down beside the Winkie River, finished up the rest of the
  sandwiches for lunch, and then looked eagerly around for someone else to
  question. But the yellow-bearded ferryman who presently came into sight
  poling his old-fashioned raft across the turbulent river knew no more of
  Ozma and the other rulers of Oz than the fisherman. But he told them many
  long and boring stories of Skamperoo and his white horse, Chalk. Dorothy
  and Pigasus had to make such an effort to listen politely, they were
  relieved when he finally shoved off and began poling himself back to the
  other side.
 "Have you any idea how far we've come?" asked Pigasus, rolling over and over
  in the cool grass as Dorothy made a face at the ferryman's back.
 "Yes," said Dorothy, dropping full length beside him. "This river is in
  about the center of the Winkie Kingdom, so we are easily half way. We could
  reach the Deadly Desert by night, fly over tomorrow morning, and either go
  North to Ev or stop at the underground castle of the Gnome King. Even if he
  won't lend us his army, he might lend us some magic."
 "Speaking of armies, they must have whisked the soldier with the green
  whiskers off with the others. I don't remember seeing him after he left the

  banquet hall, do you? Which just goes to show this Skamperoo must be a
  stranger to Oz, for who else would have been afraid of our precious old
  army? Why, he wouldn't even tread on a caterpillar. By the way, has Kaliko
  any magic that might tell us where to look for our vanished friends and
  rulers?"
 "I'm not sure of that," Dorothy told him dubiously, "but he was a wizard,
  and Ruggedo, who was King before Kaliko, had many magic treasures and
  powers. He could make floors and walls spin round and round, open yawning
  caverns at your feet, or drop rocks down on your head without even moving."
 "Sounds lovely," sniffed Pigasus, coming to his feet with a short grunt.
  "Say, haven't we trouble enough at home without going to look for it? Do
  you really propose to visit this tricky little metal monarch?"
 "But Kaliko is not nearly so bad as Ruggedo." Dorothy sat up and smoothed
  her dress earnestly.
 "Well, just as you wish." Pigasus shrugged his wings. "With me, people are
  like eggs, either good or bad. There's no such thing as a nearly good egg;
  it's got to be completely good, or it's just as bad as a bad egg. D'ye see?
  And if this Gnome King is only as good as a nearly fresh egg, I wouldn't
  trust him with my second-best toothbrush. My idea would be to go to the
  ruler of Ev."
 "That's Evardo, a boy King. Ozma helped him, too," Dorothy explained
  importantly. "But I tell you, Piggins, let's not decide till we cross the
  Deadly Desert. Something might turn up before then. You never can tell."
 "No," agreed the pig, shaking his head sagely. "In Oz, you never can.
  Suppose we continue a ways on foot? My wings are a bit stiff, and we really

  should be on the lookout for a friendly house or castle where we could have
  supper and spend the night. I could eat a peck of spinach or a bushel of
  apples right now, so hop up, my dear, and I'll stretch a leg for the good
  of the coz and Oz!" Chattering away like the good fellow he was, Pigasus
  trotted briskly across the fields and presently came to a deep, rustling
  forest. "Shall we fly over or walk through?" questioned the pig, sniffing
  appreciatively the cool air drifting out to them.
 "Let's go through it, in a wood There might be witches, some are good.
 A good witch with her magic powers Could solve this mystery of ours!"
 "But suppose we meet a bad one," muttered Pigasus, stepping gingerly into
  the forest and picking his way with great care between the giant trees.
 "Then we'll say goodbye and simply fly," laughed Dorothy, snapping her
  fingers joyfully.
 "Yes, but flying would not be so easy in here," objected Pigasus with a
  troubled glance aloft. "These branches are interlocked so closely I'd stick
  in a tree like a kite."
 "Oh, we probably won't meet anyone," said Dorothy. Slipping off his back,
  she walked along beside him, one arm flung cozily around his neck. She was
  rather tired of making verses and thought she could think better if her
  head were not continually buzzing with rhymes. After the hot, sunny
  meadows, the cool shade of the forest was very welcome, but as they
  advanced farther and farther into the shadows, it grew so dark and grim the
  two began to look at each other in real alarm.
 "Must be a squall or thundershower brewing," observed Pigasus in a faint
  voice.
 "Yes, it couldn't be nighttime so soon," agreed Dorothy, looking fearfully

  over her shoulder. The crackling of twigs as some large animal made its way
  through the brush sounded like gunfire, and while they were trying to make
  up their minds whether to run back or push forward, a long, hollow roar
  sent them skittering forward practically as one. Missing trees by mere
  inches, they pelted at breakneck speed into the dense and even gloomier
  stretch of woodland ahead.
 "B-b-b-better climb on my back," directed Pigasus, halting at last from lack
  of breath rather than inclination.
 "But where are you? I can't even see you!" wailed Dorothy, feeling about
  wildly.
 "Here, here," grunted the frantic pig, making short dashes in four or five
  directions and finally bumping violently into the groping little girl.
 Snatching at a wing, Dorothy pulled herself thankfully up and clasped both
  arms round his neck. In a tense and breathless silence they waited for it
  to grow lighter. They could not see even an inch before their noses now,
  and the darkness and silence grew more oppressive and unbearable every
  minute.
 "J-j-j-just a cloud passing over," croaked Pigasus, trying to keep his teeth
  from chattering. "J-j-j-j Say, what's that? Dorothy, do you hear
  anything? F-f-footsteps not four, TWO. Someone's coming. Hello, there.
  Who are you? Watch out now, we're here."
 "I see you," answered a flat, matter-of-fact voice.
 "Oh! He sees us, yet we can't see him, I'm frightened deaf and dumb,
 Oh, try to fly, Pigasus, why Oh why'd we ever come?"
 "That's what I'd like to know," went on the voice sternly. "Now, then, will

  you come quietly, or must I drag you along?"
  
 CHAPTER 10
 THE WITCH OF THE BLACK FOREST
 Dorothy and her companion were too stunned to answer, and in two thumping
  steps the owner of the voice was upon them. "Do you dare to defy a member
  of the Invincible Black Watch?" breathed the stranger, grasping Pigasus
  roughly by the right wing.
 "No! No! We don't exactly defy you," squealed the pig, flapping his other
  wing frantically, "but how can we follow a blackguard whom we cannot even
  see?"
 "Then how do you know I am a blackguard?" demanded their captor
  suspiciously.
 "From your voice," screamed Pigasus, jerking this way and that way in an
  effort to free himself. "I'd know you for a blackguard anywhere. Unhand me,
  you surly black monster."
 "You talk a lot for a fellow who cannot see," scoffed the Guard, tightening
  his grip on the pig's wing. "Is the girl blind, too?"
 "We're not blind at all, and why should we be, In this horrid black forest
  how could we see?" cried Dorothy, her indignation getting the better of her
  fright.
 "Well, what color are your eyes?" Dorothy felt the hot breath of the
  Guardsman on her neck as he leaned over to find out for himself. "Blue!" he
  murmured in evident puzzlement. "And the pig's eyes are blue, too. So
  that's the reason."
 "What has the color to do with it?" grunted Pigasus, growing a little calmer

  as the conversation progressed without either of them coming to actual
  harm.
 "Everything," explained the Guard impressively. "In the Black Forest one
  must have black eyes to see. See? Even a pig should know that."
 "Well, I suppose I could run into a tree and black my eyes," sniffed Pigasus
  bitterly. "But thank you, no. I prefer blue eyes, and now, if you will
  kindly conduct us to the edge of this deep, dark, dangerous and disgusting
  domain, we'll be delighted to go, leave, depart, and bid you farewell
  forever."
 "Oh, keep all that for Gloma," drawled the Guard indifferently. "I'm a plain
  man and prefer plain language. Furthermore, no one leaves this forest
  unless they break the black laws. If you break the law, you are cast out
  into the utter and awful light of eternal day. Now then, come along!" and
  giving the pig's wing a cruel tweak, he tramped doggedly forward. Pigasus,
  to save his precious feathers, was obliged to come, suiting his gait to the
  guard's strides.
 "The best thing for us to do is to break the law at once," he whispered
  mournfully to Dorothy as he blinked about in a desperate effort to
  penetrate the gloom. Dorothy was too depressed to answer, and after
  clearing his throat several times, the Blackguard began to question
  Pigasus.
 "Why the wings?" he asked inquiringly. "I've seen many a farmyard creature
  in my day, but never a pig with wings. Are you a pig or a kind of balcony
  bird? What right has a pig to wings?"
 "Let go and I'll show you," puffed Pigasus, hoping the fellow's curiosity

  would cause him to loosen his hold. But the Guard only laughed at such an
  idea.
 "Let you go? I should say not," he exclaimed with a little chuckle. "You can
  show all your little tricks to Gloma, and she can decide whether to ride or
  roast you. This girl on your back will make a splendid slave."
 "Slave!" shrilled Pigasus, stumbling angrily along in the dark. "I'll have
  you know that she is a Princess of Oz and lives in the palace of Ozma of
  Oz."
 "Then why did she not stay there?" observed the Guard reasonably enough.
  "Anyone coming into this forest comes under the rule of Gloma, Witch of the
  Black Forest."
 "Witch?" coughed the pig as Dorothy, tightening her clutch on his neck,
  almost choked him.
 "Yes, witch," repeated the forester calmly. "Now then, hold up your heads,
  you pale and pinky skins, for you are in for a good blacking." And before
  Pigasus knew just what WAS happening, the ground slipped away from under
  him and he and Dorothy were plunged into the rough, chilly waters of a
  tumbling forest stream. Striking out with all four feet, Pigasus managed to
  breast the flood, when he felt himself and Dorothy being forced completely
  under. As a matter of fact, the Guard swimming beside him had simply put
  his hand on Dorothy's head and pushed her and the squealing pig beneath the
  surface. As they rose, gasping and sputtering, he again seized Pigasus by
  the wing and pulled him quickly to shore.
 "There, now you're all right," he boomed heartily as Dorothy rolled off the
  pig's back and began shaking the water from her eyes and hair and wringing
  out her dripping skirts. "Just blot yourselves on the bank!"

 "Bl-blot ourselves?" gurgled Pigasus, giving himself a violent shake. "Do
  you take us for letters? You you'll be sorry for this!" But right in
  the middle of his angry sputters, he gave a loud and astonished squall.
  "Dorothy, Dorothy, I can see!" panted the pink pig exultantly.
 "So can I," cried Dorothy, running excitedly toward him. "But everything
  looks black. Everything IS black, even you. Oh, Oh! You're perfectly coal
  black, Piggins. Am I black, too?"
 "Of course," answered the Guard in a bored voice, "and much better so. Since
  you are black yourselves, you can see in the dark like the rest of us, and
  what do you think of our forest now?" But Dorothy, instead of telling him,
  held up her shiny black hands, touched a few strands of her perfectly black
  hair, and then, dropping her head on the pig's shoulder, began to weep
  bitterly. Like drops of ink, the tears coursed down her ebony cheeks, and
  though Pigasus did what he could to comfort her, she continued to sob as if
  her heart would break.
 "Well, I must say I call this ungrateful," the Guard shifted from one foot
  to the other. "What's the matter with you, anyway? Black is a splendid
  color, doesn't show dirt, doesn't fade or streak. Besides, it's against the
  law to be any other color in this forest."
 "How dare you blacken us against our will?" burst out Pigasus furiously.
  "Wait till I get loose, I'll Why, I'll tear you to pieces20and pitch
  you into a tar barrel."
 "Oh, don't make me snort!" The huge Black Forester stared contemptuously
  down at the winged pig, and now that Pigasus had a better look at him, he
  saw the folly of his threats, for the Black Guard was well over six feet

  and lean and tough as black leather. Evidently feeling he had wasted enough
  time on the pair, he gave them a very black look, and jerking the pig's
  wing roughly, started walking stolidly through the forest. Never had
  Dorothy felt so blue or rather so black and blue so wet, so
  discouraged, so thoroughly miserable! And when, sticking out her tongue to
  see if it was still pink she discovered that it, too, was black, she began
  sobbing softly to herself.
 "No one will know us anymore," she decided dejectedly. "We're as badly off
  now as Ozma and the others. Why, oh why, did we ever come into this
  terrible forest?" She could feel Pigasus sniffing with sympathy, and
  suddenly realizing that she was not behaving very well, she straightened
  up. After all, she was still a Princess, even though she was black.
  Princesses did not cry even when they were captured and enchanted. Ozma was
  probably in a worse fix than this, and if Ozma was being brave, she would
  be brave too. So with a great effort, Dorothy stifled her sobs and began to
  look around her. To her surprise and astonishment, she discovered that the
  Black Forest was not dark and gloomy as it had seemed before, but really
  quite beautiful. There were many shades and degrees of blackness in the
  trees and flowers that thickly carpeted the ground.
 Black birds twittered musically in the branches overhead, and every now and
  then a deer peered timidly out at her from the woodsy depths between the
  tree trunks. The Guard, glancing over his shoulder and catching her
  interested expression, ventured a smile.
 "Why, he is not bad looking at all," thought Dorothy with a pleased start.
  "And maybe this witch may be a good witch her name sounds rather
  pretty." Quite comforted by these reflections, Dorothy whispered a few

  rhymed remarks in the pig's ear. Pigasus, it must be confessed, was as
  interested in what he saw as Dorothy, and when a sudden break between the
  trees revealed a great, black, circular wall with a hundred black flags
  floating from its many turrets, he gave an involuntary grunt of admiration.
 "You are about to enter the Royal Circle of Gloma, Witch of the Black
  Forest," announced the Guard, raising his hand solemnly. "I trust you will
  conduct yourselves in a fitting manner."
 "Don't worry about OUR manners," shrilled Pigasus, tossing his head airily.
  "We are accustomed to Royalty and move in exclusive circles at home."
 "And talk in circles, too," muttered the Guard impatiently. "Well, well, do
  the best you can and bow three times as you approach the throne."
 "Throne?" queried Dorothy, slipping off the pig's back so she would not have
  to talk in rhyme, for what she had to say to the black witch was very
  serious indeed. "Is Gloma a Queen?"
 "Certainly our witch is a Queen, a bewitching Queen," retorted the Guard,
  taking Dorothy firmly by the hand and tightening his hold on Pigasus. "Now
  then, smile and look pleasant, and perhaps she'll allow you to be her
  slave."
 "She wouldn't dare make me a slave," cried Dorothy, trying her best to pull
  away from her captor.
 "Just let her try it!" blustered Pigasus, scuffling unwillingly along on the
  other side. But paying no attention to their struggles, the Guard lifted
  his foot and kicked three times on a black ebony door in the wall, and a
  tall Watchman dressed in a black leather suit admitted them to the Royal
  Circle. It was all so different from what Dorothy had been expecting, she

  almost forgot her anger. Enclosed by the black marble wall was a strange
  and enchanting garden. Now Dorothy had never seen a black garden or dreamed
  one could be so beautiful. Here sable willows mirrored their feathery
  branches in long, shining pools; here black plum and cherry trees flaunted
  their fragile black blossoms, and jet-black fountains sent their smoking
  waters high into the quiet air. Vast satiny expanses of lawn were dotted
  with a hundred beds of dusky roses, tulips, velvety pansies and daffodils.
 Built all round the circular wall was a low but sumptuous black castle, and
  seated on an ebony throne in the center of her stately black garden was the
  Black Queen herself, looking, Dorothy was thankful to discover, much more
  like a Queen than a witch. Gloma's face was sweet and serious, her hair
  fine and glossy as a raven's wing. She was dressed in a trailing robe black
  chiffon that billowed in lacy clouds round her feet. A sparkling crown of
  jet and long jet earrings were her only ornaments. On each side of the
  Black Queen crouched a sleek black leopard, and behind the ebony throne
  stood ten tall foresters with gleaming axes. "Like headsmen in a medieval
  history book," thought Dorothy as she and Pigasus were dragged rapidly
  forward. Gloma, gazing dreamily into a black crystal set on a marble stand
  before the throne, seemed entirely unaware of their presence till the harsh
  voice of the Black Guard announced them.
 "Hail! Black and Imperial Majesty!" called the Guard deferentially,
  approaching the throne. "Two prisoners, a pig and a Princess, whom I found
  wandering unlawfully in our forest and whom I took the liberty of
  blacking."
 Dorothy, jerking away from the Guard, was about to explain how she and
  Pigasus had lost their way when Gloma jumped to her feet with a sharp,

  agonized scream. "Blotz, General Blotz, what have you done?" panted the
  Black Queen, beating her hands wildly together. "Your stupidity has ruined
  us all! You have blackened and insulted my most dangerous and mortal enemy!
  Leave! Go! Begone and never darken my doors again! Oh why, why did you do
  it? Why have you brought her here? After all these years must I too be
  destroyed and obliterated?" Sinking back on her throne, Gloma covered her
  face with her hair and began rocking backward and forward in agitation and
  sorrow.
 "Why, why I believe she's afraid of you!" puffed Pigasus, twitching his
  tail with excitement and interest as General Blotz, looking quite dazed,
  began to move unhappily toward the gate in the wall.
 "Quick!" he grunted as the ten foresters back of the throne rushed forward
  to surround them. "Do something, Dorothy, while she is still afraid of you.
  Make her unblacken us. Tell her to set us free. Hurry! Hurry, before she
  discovers you are only a harmless little girl." But Dorothy, only half
  listening to the pig, boldly thrust aside the foresters and ran over to the
  Black Queen.
 "Why are you afraid of ME?" asked Dorothy, speaking rapidly but distinctly.
  "I did not come here on purpose. Pigasus and I are lost and need your
  help."
 "Help?" shivered Gloma, shrinking as far away from Dorothy as possible. "Why
  should I help you? Are you not Dorothy, the mortal girl who destroyed the
  powerful Witches of the East and West?"
 "But that was long ago," explained Dorothy breathlessly as two of the
  Queen's henchmen seized her roughly by the arms. "And they were bad and

  wicked witches. Why should I wish to destroy such a good and beautiful
  witch like you?"
 "Do not listen to her. Do not let her touch you. She means to destroy and
  ensnare you," hissed the foresters as they dragged Dorothy away from the
  throne. "Down with all mortals! Away to the dungeons with her! Wing that
  pig! Chop off their heads!" At these loud, savage cries, startled faces
  appeared at the windows of the black palace, and struggling in the midst of
  the foresters Dorothy heartily wished she had taken the pig's advice.
 "Shall we take off her head now or later?" puffed the fellow who had
  hold of her left arm.
 "Now!" roared the axman who had hold of her right.
 "Stop!" commanded the Queen, rising suddenly. "You cannot harm this girl. Do
  you not see the star of protection on her forehead?" At these words the
  woodsmen stared fearfully down at Dorothy, and sure enough, shining in the
  center of her black forehead was a pure white star. Pigasus, who had not
  noticed it before himself, gave a grunt of relief and began kicking out in
  every direction.
 "How about the pig?" yelled a forester, leaning down to rub his shins.
  "Shall we take off his head?"
 "If you dare touch Pigasus," screamed Dorothy, resolved to use all the
  powers she was supposed to have, "I'll turn you all to bats and beetles and
  horrid black ants." A breathless silence followed Dorothy's threat. The
  foresters still kept their hold on the prisoner, but at as great a distance
  as they could manage.
 "Do as you wish, comrades," the tallest of the axmen solemnly broke the
  silence, "but I'm for letting them alone. I've never been an ant before and

  don't intend to begin now. Come, away to the dungeons with them. This is
  not for us to settle with axes, it is a case for witch work."
 "You are right." The Queen, who had been standing motionless as a statue,
  took a decisive step forward. "Take them away, but not to the dungeons!
  Take them to the darkroom in my imperial palace. They shall see what
  happens to those who defy Gloma, Witch of the Black Forest."
 "Aye! Aye! They shall see," muttered the foresters, pushing Dorothy and
  Pigasus roughly along ahead of them.
  
 CHAPTER 11
 BLACK MAGIC
 Dorothy and Pigasus were hustled into the Black Castle, rushed down its
  shiny black corridors and thrust into a great, dark, dome-shaped room so
  quickly they had no opportunity to exchange a word.
 "Well, anyway, even if it is a darkroom, we can still see," whispered
  Dorothy as the foresters in their haste to get away from such dangerous
  prisoners fairly tumbled over each other to get through the door.
 "Yes," puffed Pigasus glumly as the key rasped in the lock, "and the first
  thing I see is that there are no windows. If there was a window we could
  fly off. As it is, this witch will make short work of us."
 "I wonder how much magic she really knows," sighed Dorothy, seating herself
  wearily on a black velvet20stool.
 "I wonder!" said Pigasus, flinging himself crossly on the floor beside her.
  "And what's all this stuff about your being her worst enemy? Did you really
  destroy two witches, and could you destroy her?" Although Pigasus had lived

  in the Emerald City for several years, he was not familiar with all of the
  history that had taken place before his arrival.
 "Oh, all that happened when I first came here," explained Dorothy, clasping
  her knees with both hands. "You see, when the cyclone blew me from Kansas
  to Oz, my house fell on the wicked witch who ruled the Munchkins and killed
  her. The Munchkins, supposing I had done it on purpose, came out and
  thanked me and gave me the witch's silver shoes. Then, when I reached the
  Emerald City and begged the Wizard, who was ruler of Oz at that time, to
  send me back to Kansas, he promised to do so if I killed the wicked witch
  who ruled the Winkies."
 "And did you?" asked Pigasus, rolling over and looking up at Dorothy with
  real admiration.
 "Well, that was sort of an accident, too," admitted the little girl
  honestly. "When the Tin Woodman, the Scarecrow and the Cowardly Lion and I
  reached the witch's yellow castle, the witch captured us all and made me
  work hard from morning till night. But one day," Dorothy with an anxious
  eye on the door hurriedly continued, "one day when she tried to steal my
  silver shoes, I got SO mad I picked up a bucket of water I'd been using for
  scrubbing and flung it right over her head."
 "And did that destroy her?" Pigasus demanded incredulously.
 "Yes," said Dorothy, "it melted her down to nothing at all."
 "But what about the star? I never noticed that before."
 "That's where the Good Witch of the North comes in," answered Dorothy
  proudly. "Right after my house fell on the Wicked Witch of the West, she
  appeared, and when she discovered I was a mortal, she kissed me on the
  forehead to keep me from harm all the time I was in Oz. It only shows now

  because I'm black, I suppose."
 "Well, why didn't it keep you from turning black, if it's so wonderful?"
  Pigasus switched his curly tail resentfully.
 "I don't know." Dorothy looked thoughtfully around Gloma's strange
  laboratory. "Maybe the spell has worn off; maybe there's no harm in being
  black."
 "Humph! There may not be any harm in it, but it's pretty sad and mournful,
  if you ask me," grunted Pigasus, glaring savagely at his satiny black
  sides. "I prefer myself pink and you pink and white the way you were. Tea
  and turnips, first thing I know you'll be powdering your nose with ashes
  and soot! But, after all" Pigasus swung himself energetically to
  his feet "that is the least of our troubles. What do you suppose
  this witch will do to us now? And what can we do to her? Sa-hay!" Spreading
  his wings, Pigasus spun round in a triumphant circle. "All we have to do is
  to find some water. Why, it's simple as soup. Quick, Dorothy, look and see
  whether there is any water around here, then as soon as Gloma pops her nose
  in the door, we'll put her out as neatly as you did that other witch."
 "But those other witches were bad, and Gloma seems really good and
  beautiful," objected Dorothy, looking around without much enthusiasm.
 "Beautiful or not, she's a dark and dangerous lady," insisted the pig,
  beginning his search in a methodical way, "and it's her beauty or ours,
  remember; this Black Queen is quite determined to destroy us if we don't
  destroy her first."
 "Yes, I suppose so," agreed Dorothy. Slowly following Pigasus, she pulled
  aside black velvet curtains, peered behind cupboards and screens, and

  looked under sofas and chairs. There were many ebony cabinets standing
  against the wall, but each one was securely locked, and except for a great
  black crystal ball on a table in the center of the room there seemed to be
  no magic apparatus at all. A dark lantern swinging from the domed ceiling
  cast its curious luminous black rays into every corner of the witch's
  laboratory. After circling the room three times, Pigasus and Dorothy were
  forced to admit there was no water of any kind or even a pail available.
 "We'll have to think of something else," grumbled the pig as Dorothy again
  sat down on her stool.
 "Are you thinking?" he demanded sharply as the little girl stared absently
  at the tips of her boots.
 "No," confessed Dorothy frankly, "I was just wondering why Gloma calls this
  a darkroom. She must know since General Blotz ducked us under the Black
  River we can see in here as well as in the forest."
 "I wouldn't be too sure of that," muttered the pig, coming over and crowding
  as close to Dorothy as he could. It almost seemed as if someone had heard
  him, for scarcely were the words out of his mouth before the dark lantern
  over their heads sputtered ominously and went out, leaving them in a
  perfectly pitch-black darkness.
 "I I I felt something like this would happen," faltered Pigasus,
  throwing his left wing protectingly around Dorothy. "Listen! Someone is
  coming."
 A light, sure footstep sounded in the passage, came closer, then a sudden
  puff of air told them that someone had opened the door.
 "Remember, Piggins dear, no matter what happens, we must be brave,"
  whispered Dorothy, trembling a little in spite of herself.

 "It's hard to be brave in the dark, but I'll do my best. Here, lean on me."
  And though the happenings of the next ten minutes were enough to try the
  courage of a dozen lions, Pigasus kept his word and never uttered a sound.
  As the two prisoners clung desperately together, the crystal on the center
  table received a sudden, shattering blow. Up spurted a perfect fountain of
  fire, coming down over Dorothy and Pigasus in a shower of red-hot sparks.
  But the sparks fell harmlessly as raindrops on the winged pig and the
  little girl, and after a great hiss and sputter went out, leaving the
  laboratory in darkness again.
 Scarcely had they recovered from this shock before a second blow was struck,
  and this time a hundred huge, hideous, black snakes came writhing out of
  the crystal, their green, glittering eyes lighting up the room with a
  terrifying, sulphurous light. The great twisting mass grew more and more
  menacing, sending out its long, curving bodies like arms to encircle them.
  This, thought Dorothy, burying her head in Pigasus' wing, was black magic
  at its worst. Now she could feel the clammy coils all around her and waited
  breathlessly to be crushed and broken. But the cold, heavy bodies seemed
  powerless and without weight, and presently they, too, slipped away and
  vanished.
 A shower of silver arrows followed the snakes and a cloud of choking green
  smoke the arrows. But each blow on the crystal only seemed to prove further
  the potency of the kiss set on Dorothy's forehead so long ago by the Good
  Witch of the North. And because she clung so tightly to Pigasus, he, too,
  came unharmed through the hair-raising ordeal. As they both, almost afraid
  to breathe, waited for the next blow on the dark crystal, a long, tremulous

  sigh came mournfully through the darkness. "It is no use," murmured a
  discouraged voice, "my black magic is of no avail. Come, then, destroy me
  if you must, but do it quickly, and I pray you will spare my people, who
  have never harmed or hurt a living soul in Oz."
 With a little thrill, Dorothy recognized the voice of the Black Queen, and
  as the dark lantern again shed its twinkling black rays over the circular
  apartment, Gloma rose and came calmly and rapidly toward them. Dorothy and
  Pigasus, who had just had their own bravery so severely tested, could not
  but admire the spirit and bravery of the Witch of the Black Forest. Even
  though she was sure she faced certain destruction, she walked proudly
  erect, her head flung back, her great mass of dusky hair billowing behind
  her.
 "Stop!" cried Dorothy, on whom the Queen's dark beauty had made a deep and
  lasting impression. "Why should we wish to destroy you? We came through the
  Yellow Wood and from there into the Black Forest, but we only wished to go
  through as quickly as possible. We are in trouble ourselves. Did you know
  that Ozma of Oz, the Wizard of Oz, the four rulers of Oz, and many others
  have vanished? There is a false Emperor on the throne in the Emerald City,
  and under the magic of his enchantment all the people have forgotten Ozma
  ever was their Queen. Pigasus and I, escaping this enchantment, are trying
  to find Ozma and someone to help us restore her to power." Dorothy spoke
  with such earnestness and feeling, Gloma could not help believing her.
 "Then then you did not come here to destroy me at all?" she exclaimed
  with an unhappy and embarrassed glance at her two prisoners. "Forgive me
  for using my magic powers, I only wanted to save myself and my foresters
  from obliteration."

 "Oh, that's all right." Dorothy dismissed with a careless shrug the danger
  and discomfort of the last hour. "You thought we were going to destroy you,
  so, of course, you tried to destroy us first. That was fair enough, and I
  don't blame you, but now that we understand each other better, perhaps you
  will help us. Do you, yourself, remember Ozma, and is your magic powerful
  enough to tell us where she is?"
 Seating herself in a chair near Dorothy's footstool, Gloma stared
  thoughtfully at the velvet carpet. "I know or remember nothing of the
  present history of Oz," she told them after a short silence. "At the time
  the Wizard of Oz ruled Oz, I ruled by royal right and inheritance the
  entire southern part of the Winkie Empire. Although the Wicked Witch of the
  East claimed dominion over the whole country, she only succeeded in
  bringing the central and northern parts under her control. We in the South
  were free, but when word came that a mortal girl had destroyed both the
  Witch of the East and the Witch of the West, I, being a witch, naturally
  supposed I would be the next one to suffer destruction. So, calling
  together the strongest and most faithful of my subjects, I begged them to
  retire with me to a safe and hidden spot where we could live in safety and
  tranquility far from the wars, dangers, and changing fortunes of the times.
  Many of my Southern Winkies cast their lot with the new order, marching off
  to the North, but many came with me, and retiring to this hidden forest, we
  cut ourselves off from all intercourse with the other Kingdoms of Oz,
  living the free and happy life of foresters and enjoying all the beauty and
  benefits of outdoor sport and activity. Of the rulers in Oz since the
  Wizard, I know nothing whatever."

 "And were you always black?" inquired Pigasus, peering inquisitively up into
  Gloma's face and wondering whether the two small, black wings on each side
  of her forehead were as useful as his own.
 "No," admitted the Queen, smiling graciously down at her plump questioner.
  "That was part of our disappearing plan; in a dark forest we were so much
  less likely to be found or discovered, so with my knowledge of the black
  arts I turned myself and my subjects as black as you now see us."
 "What a shame! What a pity!" Dorothy jumped up and perched cozily on the arm
  of the Black Queen's chair. "If you had just come to the Emerald City, we
  could have been friends all this while."
 "Why not begin now?" smiled the Queen, putting her arm affectionately round
  Dorothy's waist. "And you must not be sorry for us, for here we have been
  perfectly happy and content, and I have grown so fond of my black forest
  and castle I would not change their lovely sable for all the other colors
  in the rainbow. But tell me quickly again all that has happened in Oz, and
  perhaps I can make amends for the shabby treatment you have received at our
  hands."
 Contritely the Black Queen leaned down to pat Pigasus, and as Dorothy
  sketched in most of the important happenings in Oz since the reign of the
  Wizard, the little pig pressed closely against her side. With many
  interested nods and exclamations, Gloma listened, and when Dorothy
  described the great festival that had been planned to celebrate the
  discovery of Oz by mortals, how Ozma and all her most important visitors
  and advisers had vanished at the banquet, and a false Emperor taken
  possession of the palace, the Queen rose and walked solemnly over to the
  black crystal. But after a long look into its inky depths, Gloma turned

  sadly away.
 "My black magic cannot help you," she told them regretfully. "The rulers of
  Oz and your other friends have been enchanted by green magic, and only by
  green magic can they be released and restored to power. But I can assist
  you in other ways," added the Queen, noting the disappointed expressions on
  the faces of her two new friends. "One tap of my scepter will transport you
  to any country and here" from a drawer in the ebony table the Queen
  drew a small, black, round box "in this container you will find a
  most powerful powder of darkness. One pinch of this powder tossed into the
  air will cause a black cloud a mile square to envelop and totally darken a
  city or country. While no one in this darkened area will be able to see
  you, it will be perfectly possible for you to see them as clearly as in the
  usual daylight. In case of danger it affords a safe way of escape from the
  enemy. To dispel the cloud, you merely close the box."
 "That ought to be just the thing to use if we ever get back to the Emerald
  City," observed Pigasus, scratching his left ear with his right hind paw.
  "Why, we could swoop down on this Emperor, bind him fast, and tweak him by
  the nose before he even knew what was happening."
 "Why, so we could!" beamed Dorothy, brightening up at once. "And now, though
  of course black is a perfectly beautiful color, could you change us back to
  the colors we were when we came?" Dorothy spoke timidly, for she did not
  want to hurt Gloma's feelings.
 "As soon as you leave the forest, you will resume your natural coloring,"
  the witch assured them with a little smile. "And where, may I ask, were you
  planning to go first?"

 "Well," said Dorothy slowly, "I thought perhaps the countries outside of Oz
  might not be under this forgetting spell and that we might find in one of
  them a King who would lend us his army and help us to chase Skamperoo out
  of the Emerald City. Could you transport us as far as Ev, your Majesty?"
 "As easily as I could invite you to dinner," Gloma assured them with an
  energetic little nod, "and I hope you will not only have dinner but rest
  yourselves before you start again on your dangerous journey."
 "Pigasus Pigasus, did you hear that? She can transport us all the way to
  Ev! Didn't I tell you we might find a good witch in this forest? Now
  everything will be all right!"
 "So glad we met and got acquainted, You're not so black as you are painted!"
  chuckled Pigasus, breaking into rhyme from sheer good humor and relief.
  "And did I hear your Majesty invite us to dinner?"
 "You certainly did," said Gloma, and dropping them a little bow, she swept
  gaily through the door.
 "D'ye suppose it will be a black dinner?" whispered Pigasus, trotting
  briskly along beside Dorothy. "I've heard of light repasts, but never of
  dark ones. But I don't care. I'm hungry enough to eat tar pudding with
  cinder sauce."
 "Sh-hh!" warned Dorothy with a little laugh. "She'll hear you."
  
 CHAPTER 12
 FAREWELL TO THE BLACK FOREST
 Although the dinner in the Black Castle was as dark a repast as Pigasus had
  predicted, never had he or Dorothy dined more royally or partaken of more
  delicate fare. The black bean soup was followed by a black fish course,

  then came the dark meat of some superbly cooked fowl, "probably
  cinder-roosters," as Pigasus remarked in one of his humorous asides. The
  licorice was the most delicious of the vegetables, though the black
  asparagus and potatoes were appetizing, too. Black bread was served with
  the black grape salad and plum cake with black frosting with the black ices
  and blackberryade. The members of Gloma's household, now that their fear of
  Dorothy had been explained away, proved so interesting and merry, the time
  simply flew. The black lace frocks of the women and children and the soft
  leather suits of the black foresters were simple but elegant, and the Black
  Queen herself so lovely just to look at her gave one a curious thrill.
 General Blotz, recalled from banishment by Blackjack, the Queen's pet
  Jackdaw, proved a singer of no mean ability and regaled the company with
  many famous black ballads and hunting songs. Pigasus, too, contributed to
  the general fun and gaiety with some of his best songs and verses and ate
  so many slices of the black plum cake, Dorothy began to feel positively
  uneasy.
 Interesting and delightful as it all was, the little girl could not help
  thinking of Ozma and her other unfortunate and captive friends, and as the
  black banjo clock in the corner of the hall struck a musical ten, she
  lightly touched the arm of Gloma. The Black Queen had graciously placed
  Dorothy beside her.
 "I think we had better go now," whispered Dorothy earnestly. "If Pigasus
  eats any more, he'll fall asleep and we'll have to wait till morning."
  Gloma smiled and nodded understandingly then, pressing Dorothy's hand for
  "goodbye," stole quietly off to her workshop. Dorothy tried to signal

  Pigasus across the gleaming black table, but before she could catch his eye
  he had vanished, and she herself was whirling dizzily through space.
 "Maybe it would have been better to have spent the night in the castle,"
  mused Dorothy, spreading her arms like wings as she sailed through the air.
  "I don't suppose we'll be able to see in the dark now that we are out of
  the Black Forest, and goodness knows where we'll come down." There was no
  moon, and peer about as she would, Dorothy could not even catch a glimpse
  of the flying pig. "Of course," Dorothy went on conversationally to
  herself, "we could have flown all this distance on Piggins' back, but this
  is quicker and less trouble, but oh, dear, I do hope he's all right." Her
  worry about the pink pig ended rather abruptly, for at that very moment she
  began to somersault over and over in a headlong drop to the ground. A
  painful grunt as she landed assured her of the pig's presence.
 "What are you trying to do? Puncture me?" puffed Pigasus as Dorothy with an
  embarrassed little gasp of apology rolled off his back. "Such rudeness!"
  grunted her companion, scrambling to his feet with an angry snort.
  "Flinging us out of her castle as if we'd been garbage. Yes, garbage," he
  repeated, winking rapidly.
 "It was my fault," cried Dorothy, moving over to smooth out his ruffled wing
  feathers. "I asked her to transport us to Ev, and OH, PIGGINS!" By the
  light of a crooked lamp set in a crevice of the rocky path on which they
  found themselves, Dorothy regarded him rapturously. "You're pink again!"
 "Am I? Well, that's something." Waddling closer to the lamp, Pigasus
  examined himself with careful attention. "You're pink, too," he said a
  little more pleasantly, "but these magic transportations are a bit sudden,
  if you ask me, and I'm not at all sure I like this spot. Where are we,

  anyway?"
 "Oh, it's all right, and now we don't have to travel at all. We're here,"
  announced Dorothy, who had hurried on a few steps ahead.
 "And where is here?" grumbled Pigasus, following pompously, more from too
  much plum cake than from a desire to be disagreeable.
 "Why, at Kalico's Mountain!" exclaimed Dorothy, pointing excitedly to a
  small door in the rocky surface before them. "Now we don't have to decide
  between the Gnome King and the King of Ev. Since we are here, we'll try
  Kalico first."
 "Trying him is all very well, but I hope he does not try any magic on us,"
  yawned Pigasus, squinting sleepily up at the brass sign hung on the stout
  wooden door. "What does it say there?" A green lantern hung over the door,
  and by its flickering light Dorothy read slowly:
 "Back door of the Gnome King's Underground Castle. No dogs, babies or
  chickens allowed. No gold fish wanted. No peddlers or snailsmen need apply.
  Keep out and stay out. This means YOU."
 "Oh, that's all right, laughed Dorothy as Pigasus looked rather alarmed at
  the sternly worded notice. "We're not babies or chickens or goldfish, and
  Kalico's a friend of mine. Come on!" Lifting the knocker and smiling
  confidently, Dorothy knocked three times on the Gnome King's back door.
  
 CHAPTER 13
 IN KALICO'S CASTLE
 "What is it, Shoofenwaller?" Kalico, the thin and gray little King of the
  Gnomes, peered impatiently down from the great carved gem-studded rock that

  served him for a throne. "Shoo, go away. You know this is my hour for
  retiring! Go away, I tell you! And if you never come back, it will still be
  too soon."
 "Yes, but your MAJESTY!" While obediently backing toward the door, the
  King's Royal Chamberlain extended his arms imploringly. "Something has come
  up; the Long-Eared Hearer reports footsteps on the South Mountain. Two
  visitors are about to enter the back door of our castle."
 "Visitors!" exclaimed Kalico, getting up with an impatient flounce. "At this
  hour! Well, tell them to go away and come back tomorrow. Here, wait a
  moment." As Shoofenwaller, shrugging his narrow shoulders, turned to carry
  out his orders, Kalico changed his mind. "Just hand me my expectacles,"
  commanded the King crossly, "I may as well have a look at the prowling
  pests."
 With another shrug, Shoofenwaller stepped to a small cabinet, and taking a
  pair of smoked glasses from the top drawer, handed them up to the King. Now
  Kalico's expectacles were very useful, enabling him to see who was coming
  before they arrived, and clapping them hurriedly on his thin nose, he
  stared intently off into space. At what he saw, the King's expression
  changed from irritation to vague uneasiness. "Botheration!" he muttered
  morosely. "It's one of those mortals from the Emerald City. Why can't those
  girls stay home? Always poking their noses into other people's affairs and
  trying to save somebody from something."
 "Which one is it?" asked Shoofenwaller, blinking.
 "It's Dorothy," sighed Kalico, taking off his expectacles and putting them
  absently into his pocket, "and there's a queer kind of winged pig with her.
  A pig with wings, mind you. Rooks and rockets! Wonder what they want."

 "Why not find out?" suggested Shoofenwaller reasonably.
 "No! No, not tonight," Kalico waved his hands determinedly. "Just conduct
  them to the red guest cave, Shoofenwaller, and bring them to me in the
  morning." With a stiff bow, the Royal Chamberlain backed out the door and
  pattered away to admit the visitors.
 "And about time, too," thought Dorothy as the rock door opened cautiously
  and the little crooked Gnome thrust out his head.
 "In the name of King Kalico the First, I hereby welcome you to Gnome Man's
  Land," began Shoofenwaller pompously.
 "Oh, that's all right," yawned Pigasus wearily, "what we want is a place to
  sleep, and remember no trickery!" he added sharply as the Gnome stood
  aside so that they could enter the narrow rock passageway.
 "I suppose your Highness comes on a matter of state?" remarked
  Shoofenwaller, turning from Pigasus with an involuntary grimace. Pigs
  reminded him of ham; ham reminded him of eggs; and eggs were immediate
  death and destruction to gnomes.
 "Well, yes," admitted Dorothy, adjusting her step to the short, crooked legs
  of the King's little Counselor. "What I really need is an army!"
 "An army?" groaned Shoofenwaller, realizing what bad news this would be for
  his master. "Our army?"
 "Oh, let's talk about all that in the morning," wheezed Pigasus as Dorothy
  briskly nodded her head in answer to Shoofenwaller's question. The pink pig
  was taking sleepy sidelong squints at the elegantly excavated and
  gem-encrusted corridors of the Gnome King's underground dwelling.
 "Just what his Majesty suggested," muttered the Chamberlain, sweeping open a

  red iron door with a ruby knob. "I trust you will be comfortable here and
  rest well. If your Highness wishes a cup of Kalicocoa, or your friend a mud
  pie or pudding, just ring the bell. Goodnight, Princess! Goodnight, er, er
  PIG!"
 "Sa-hay, I resent that!" Pigasus cocked his ears belligerently as the King's
  crooked little messenger bowed himself out the door. "Did you notice the
  way he said `pig,' Dorothy?"
 "Yes," said Dorothy with a little yawn, "I did, but then all gnomes are
  sassy, and you'll have to get used to them. If Kalico helps us, that's all
  we care about."
 Pigasus nodded rather grimly. "I suppose this is what you call getting down
  to bed rock," he murmured, looking around the red-rock apartment with his
  amused blue stare. "Hope the beds aren't rock, too." Punching a red sofa
  experimentally and finding it surprisingly soft, the pink pig jumped up and
  settled himself cozily among the cushions. Pigasus had lived in castles and
  palaces all his life and was so accustomed to comfort and luxury that
  without bothering to look around Kalico's richly appointed guest cavern he
  closed his eyes and fell asleep. Dorothy, tiptoeing through a curtain into
  an adjoining red-rock cavern that served as a bedroom, undressed quickly
  and putting out the ruby lamps slid thankfully between the red silk sheets
  and was soon as soundly asleep as Pigasus.
 They were just having breakfast, served by two small gnomen in their red
  sitting-cave, when Shoofenwaller came hurrying in to announce that Kalico
  was ready and waiting to see them. Earlier the Gnome King and his
  Chamberlain had discussed the possible purposes of Dorothy's visit, and
  Kalico had been extremely annoyed to learn that she wanted to borrow his

  army.
 "And you will lend it to her, all our hundred thousand trained Gnomen
  Yoemen?" questioned Shoofenwaller anxiously.
 "What else can I do?" Kalico snapped his little gray eyes unhappily.
  "Remember, it was Dorothy who stole the former Gnome King's magic belt and
  really was the means of my becoming King."
 "That's so," muttered Shoofenwaller, pulling his ear reflectively. "But why
  not use a little strategy in this conference, King? Why not pretend to help
  her and at the same time safeguard your own interests? Lending our army is
  a dangerous experiment. Suppose an enemy threatened us while our fighting
  forces were in the Emerald City? Anything could happen. Put her off, make
  excuses," urged Shoofenwaller craftily. This suggestion fell in exactly
  with the Gnome King's wishes, and curious to know what really had brought
  Dorothy to his castle, he sent his little Chamberlain hurrying off to bring
  her to the throne room.
 "And now for a little Kalicoaxing," sniffed Pigasus, waddling unconcernedly
  along beside Dorothy under magnificent arches, over artificial terraces and
  rock gardens, gazing down long vistas of yet-unmined shafts where hundreds
  of gnomes worked busily with picks and shovels to further enrich the
  already enormously rich and powerful little Metal Monarch. Kalico, as they
  entered the beautifully furnished and lavishly carved cave that he used for
  a throne room, came hurrying to meet them.
 "So charming of you to come all this way just to see me," murmured the Gnome
  King, taking both of Dorothy's hands in his own and bowing graciously as
  she introduced Pigasus. "Always delighted to entertain a Princess from the

  Court of her Royal Highness, Ozma of Oz!"
 "Oh, Kalico, then you DO remember her! Oh, please, dear Kalico, will you
  help us to find her?"
 "Find her? Why, what under the earth do you mean? Is Ozma lost?" Kalico's
  long face at Dorothy's excited greeting grew visibly longer, and after the
  little girl had explained the disappearance of Ozma and the others, the
  enchantment of all the people in Oz, and the coming of Skamperoo to the
  Emerald City, Kalico climbed wearily back on his throne and sat down.
 "This this is shocking!" faltered Kalico, mopping his forehead with a
  long, gray cobweb, "And just what do you and this this pig intend
  to do about it?"
 "What do YOU intend to do about it?" Rather tired of being called a pig,
  Pigasus planted all four feet and stared defiantly up at the perturbed
  Metal Monarch.
 "Well er that is er I don't see that it is MY affair at
  all!" mumbled Kalico with a rueful nod of his head. "Anyone powerful enough
  to conquer Ozma and Oz would pay small attention to opinions of mine."
 "But we don't want your opinions," stated Pigasus bluntly. "What we want is
  your army and any magic you can conveniently spare!"
 "Please, Kalico, do help us," begged Dorothy, running up the carved rock
  steps of the throne and seating herself coaxingly on the arm. "With all
  your thousands of gnomes and many magic powers, we can certainly drive
  Skamperoo out of the Emerald City."
 "Well, of course," sighed Kalico, flattered by Dorothy's reference to his
  magic powers, "I'll do what I can, but if what you say is true, it will
  take more than one army to reconquer Oz." As he said this, Kalico looked

  across at Shoofenwaller, and the little Chamberlain, well pleased with his
  master's strategy, gave him an encouraging wink. "I tell you what I'll do."
  Kalico crossed his legs and regarded Dorothy through half-closed eyes. "If
  you find another King willing to send his army into Oz, I will also
  send mine. Remember, even Ozma's closest friends and retainers have
  forgotten her, and the entire population, now fully convinced Skamperoo is
  their rightful ruler, will rise to oppose us."
 "Yes, yes, but have you no magic that will dispel this wicked enchantment or
  help us to locate our friends and sovereigns?" demanded Pigasus, not wholly
  satisfied with the Gnome King's offer.
 "Gnome magic may be of no use in this case; nevertheless, I will send for my
  wizard and see what can be done." Remembering their last experience with
  magic, Dorothy stepped down from Kalico's throne and seated herself quietly
  on the pink pig's back, and Pigasus, grunting with relief, squinted
  suspiciously at the small, ugly Wizard of the Underworld who presently came
  shuffling into the royal presence chamber. As quickly as possible, Kalico
  explained to the Wizard all the dire happenings in Oz.
 "Do you think our magic spyglass could locate Ozma20and her missing friends
  and associates or tell us whether they have been utterly and completely
  destroyed?" demanded the Gnome King gravely.
 Potaroo, the King's magician, stood pulling his straggly whiskers for
  several moments after Kalico had finished speaking, then he stamped four
  times on the flagged floor with his right foot. Almost instantly four gnome
  wise men in peaked hats came into the throne room wheeling a huge telescope
  before them. Dorothy and Pigasus, prickling with suspense and terror,

  watched the Wizard screw his eye to the end of the twisting spyglass. After
  several snorts and surprised exclamations, Potaroo straightened up. "The
  missing Ozians and the Wizard of Ev are hidden away in Thunder Mountain,"
  he stated in a hoarse whisper. An electric little silence followed
  Potaroo's disclosure, and as no one uttered a sound, the wizard continued,
  "As the spyglass is now pointing north, I believe you will find Thunder
  Mountain in that direction, but I must warn you that it will be a long and
  exceedingly dangerous journey."
 "Danger? Well, what do we care for that? Quick somebody, fetch me my coat
  my hat"
 "This hardly seems a time for jokes and verses," murmured Kalico, looking at
  Dorothy in mild disapproval.
 "She has to make verses and rhymes when she rides me. I'm a poetry pig, and
  a lucky star guides me!" grunted Pigasus, too overcome by the wizard's
  awful news to realize he was speaking in verse himself.
 "Oh, what difference does it make?" cried Dorothy, jumping quickly off his
  back. "We must go to Thunder Mountain at once. Pigasus can fly there."
 "Here, here, not in such a hurry," exclaimed Kalico, secretly delighted at
  the prospect of being so easily rid of his troubles. "We must pack you a
  lunch basket, and tell me, Potaroo, have you any magic that will make the
  journey less dangerous for these brave young adventurers?"
 "M-magic?" stuttered Potaroo, his eyes growing glassy at the mere thought of
  parting with any of his magic treasures. "Well, er, I could lend them a box
  of my famous triple-action stumbling blocks. They will overthrow any enemy,
  no matter how numerous."
 "Splendid!" beamed Kalico, rubbing his hands briskly together, "And don't

  forget, in the course of your journey north, if you find a King willing to
  lend his army, my army also will be ready and at your service."
 "Oh, Kalico, how kind you are!" Running up the steps of the throne
  again, Dorothy gave the Gnome King an impulsive hug.
 "Come on, COME on!" squealed Pigasus, who had seen the various winks between
  Kalico and Shoofenwaller and was convinced that the little Gnome King was
  doing as little as he possibly could. "Give us our lunch and our stumbling
  blocks and we'll be off, and I must say they'll be an enormous help when we
  reach Thunder Mountain." Spreading his wings, Pigasus began to fly in angry
  circles round the Gnome King's head.
 "Humph, pork's going up!" sniffed Shoofenwaller as he hurried away to see
  about packing the lunch basket.
 "He ought to be dried, smoked and salted," muttered Potaroo, going sulkily
  off to fetch the blocks. Dorothy, in earnest consultation with Kalico,
  heard neither of these remarks, and when a few moments later the two
  returned with two boxes and Dorothy's hat and coat, she thanked them
  politely, called Pigasus down from a rocky ledge where he had flown, and
  climbed happily on his back. Then Pigasus, not giving her time for any
  lengthy farewells, zipped through the tunneled caverns and corridors of the
  Gnome King's Underground Dominions and burst thankfully out the back door
  of South Mountain.
 "Now let's see, which way is north?" mused Pigasus, twirling his curly tail
  around like a propeller. "All we have to do is to fly north to Thunder
  Mountain, unlock its thunder bolts, restore the rulers of Oz, toss tumbling
  blocks at all enemies, raise a grand army, and then, THEN King Kalico will

  help us. Isn't it just too magniferous!"
 "Why, Piggins, how mean of you, surely you know The Gnome King's our friend,
  don't you like Kalico?"
 "No!" said Pigasus fiercely, hurling himself into the air.
 "Well, anyway, we're better off than we were before," thought Dorothy after
  several rhymed attempts to draw Pigasus into a conversation. "At least we
  now know where Ozma is and have two kinds of magic and the promise of an
  army. Really, we're getting on quite fast." But perhaps had she seen the
  King and his Chamberlain nodding their heads like two little China
  mandarins as she and Pigasus left the throne room, she would not have felt
  so cheerful.
 "That's the last we'll ever see of her," chuckled Shoofenwaller, dropping a
  dried lizard instead of a lump of sugar into his tea. (Gnomes always flavor
  their tea with lizards.) "No one yet has ever come safely back from Thunder
  Mountain. But what about this new Emperor of Oz?"
 "Oh, that will be all right!" Kalico waved one hand airily. "I would much
  rather have a man on the throne of Oz. Ozma is always involving me in wars
  or demanding the rights of smaller Kingdoms, so long may she stay in
  Thunder Mountain and long Skamperoo rule in Oz!"
 "Long live the Emperor!" echoed Shoofenwaller, and clicking their teacups
  gaily together, the two bad little Gnomes drained to the last drop their
  black and bitter tea. And we should not be too hard on Kalico, I suppose,
  for like all the dwellers under the earth, his heart is gray and flinty as
  the rock that forms his cavern, the blood in his veins cold and sluggish as
  the leaden waters of the underground rivers that wind sullenly through his
  dark domain.

  
 CHAPTER 14
 THE EMPEROR OF OZ
 The same morning Dorothy wakened in the rustic summer house of the Winkie
  farmer, Skamperoo opened his eyes upon the unaccustomed grandeur of Ozma's
  Royal Palace. The banquet had lasted till long after three o'clock, then
  still chuckling and yawning, he had waved goodnight to his hilarious and
  amiable subjects and led Chalk off to bed. Twenty footmen with twenty
  lighted tapers preceded him to Ozma's own apartment, but dismissing this as
  too plain and simple, he had taken the immense green guest suite across the
  hall.
 Chalk would have much preferred a stall in the Royal Stable with the other
  four-footed members of the castle party, but Skamperoo would not hear of
  such a separation. He wanted his white wishing horse close at hand, not
  only because through him and the magic emeralds he could satisfy every
  wish, but because for the first time in his long, lazy, selfish life he had
  found someone he liked better than himself. In Skamperoo's eyes Chalk was
  absolutely perfect, and as his own wish had brought the golden-maned
  charger into being, he felt proud and important as a parent with his first
  child.
 After a few regretful sniffs out of the window, a few short turns up and
  down their immense and elegant sleeping apartment, Chalk leaped lightly on
  one of the large, green beds and settled himself gracefully for the night.
  Covering Chalk tenderly with a green satin quilt, Skamperoo hastily
  disrobed, and clutching his precious necklaces, climbed wearily into the

  other bed. There, without even stopping to wish himself goodnight, he fell
  into a deep and tranquil slumber. Indeed, both, in spite of the strangeness
  of their surroundings, slept soundly till morning.
 About eight o'clock, Chalk, lifting his head from the embroidered pillow,
  looked indulgently across at the new Emperor of Oz. Sitting up in bed,
  Skamperoo was busily counting the gems in his three magic chains.
 "Ho, throw those silly beads away!" advised the white horse, jumping out of
  bed with a gay toss of his golden mane. "You have nothing else to wish for,
  Kingaling, nothing more at all! M-mmm, this green carpet looks good enough
  to eat, but I've a fancy to nibble the clover in Your Majesty's garden
  while it is still fresh with dew."
 "Say it again," begged Skamperoo, closing his eyes and clasping himself
  blissfully around the middle.
 "Your Majesty's garden! Your Majesty's Palace, Your Majesty's Kingdom of
  Oz!" whinnied the white horse, rising on his hind legs and pirouetting
  round with mischievous little prances. "But come, Emp! What are your wishes
  for today? I think we will have to use the necklaces after all. You must
  certainly have some new clothes. It would never do to appear this morning
  in the suit you wore last night. You had better have some sleeping
  garments, too. I've a notion that Emperors do not sleep in their raw hides
  like horses." Skamperoo, giggling self-consciously, dragged the satin
  sheets up to his chin, for to tell the truth, he had arrived in the Emerald
  City with only one suit to his back, and an extremely shabby one at that.
 "Maybe I'd better change my face, too," he murmured, "to go with all this,
  you know." Dreamily Skamperoo waved his hands about, and then, leaning
  forward, slipped the chains over Chalk's ear.

 "What's the matter with the face you have?" demanded Chalk, gazing fondly at
  the red, rotund countenance of his Master. "I like you just as you are, and
  if you change I wouldn't even know you, but I'll tell you what you can
  wish after you've ordered yourself some new clothes wish yourself a
  seasoned rider, and then we can go far and wide, Kingaling, far and wide at
  a furious gallop and none shall say us nay hey, hey!"
 "And none shall say us nay," trilled Skamperoo, rolling out of bed, covers
  and all. To wish himself fifty jewel-encrusted robes with boots, crowns,
  and all the undergarments to go with them, fifty splendid sleeping robes,
  and fifty suits of riding clothes took but a moment. He and Chalk could
  hear them landing with little thuds on the hangars in the many closets as
  Skamperoo finished speaking. Then, being naturally lazy, the new Emperor
  wished that he had already had his bath and was dressed in his green riding
  clothes. So immediately he was, and winking at his clever assistant
  adviser, he next wished himself the best rider in Oz. Then, taking back his
  necklaces, he buttoned them carefully in a little pocket over his heart and
  went over to the mirror to have a look at himself.
 "How about this governing stuff?" puffed the self-made Emperor, turning this
  way and that to get a good view of his new clothes.
 "Oh, I shouldn't bother about governing," answered Chalk carelessly. "A
  well-governed country like this should be able to run itself for a few
  weeks. By that time we'll be ready for more serious matters, but right now
  I'm all for enjoying myself. A splendid idea, that, of putting all the
  rulers and the Wizard and his magic out of the way. The rest of your court
  and subjects are exceedingly sensible and jolly, and if we are pleasant and

  sensible too, everything will be `What ho and so cozy!' So let's go below
  and start our first day of emperoaring!" Impatiently Chalk pranced away
  toward the door.
 "You're sure I look all right?" asked Skamperoo with another anxious squint
  at his reflection. "Seems to me I'm a bit fat."
 "Oh, don't worry about that," said Chalk, rolling his eyes wickedly. "Come
  along, come along, and I'll soon shake some of that fat off you. Up with
  you, Kingaling, and let's to our oats!" To his delight and pleasure,
  Skamperoo had not the slightest trouble mounting, and once in the saddle he
  felt perfectly at home, even when Chalk bounded through the door, took the
  long, circular steps between a canter and a gallop, and ran madly three
  times round the Royal gardens.
 On fine days Ozma always had breakfast in her private garden, and it being
  an especially fine day, the palace servants without thought or question had
  placed the royal table under the trees. It was still fairly early, and none
  of the guests or members of the household were down, but this did not spoil
  Skamperoo's excellent appetite at all. Ordering Chalk a breakfast of oats,
  bran and quartered apples, he seated himself gaily at the head of the
  table. The green riding hat, set well over one ear, became him vastly well,
  and Chalk, regarding him proudly from the foot of the table, thought him
  every inch an Emperor, even if round the waist there were a good many too
  many inches.
 "I wish Pinny Penny could see you now," sighed the horse, sinking
  contentedly back on his haunches, "and how I should have enjoyed seeing
  Matiah's face when he finally discovered you and the necklaces were gone.
  By the way, perhaps we should do something about Matiah."

 "Pinny Penny will attend to him," said Skamperoo, popping a huge cherry into
  his mouth and nodding his head reassuringly. "I'll wager Pinny Penny sent
  the fellow packing the moment he found himself King. Wonder how Pinny is
  making out, anyway?"
 "But suppose Matiah should follow us here?" went on Chalk. Having been in
  existence only two days, he knew little of Oz or geozophy.
 "He can't come here," Skamperoo told him triumphantly. "There's a deadly
  desert between Skampavia and Oz that no one in my father's lifetime or in
  mine has ever crossed, that is with the exception of ourselves, and we were
  wished across, which doesn't count." Then, as four footmen with heaping
  trays appeared, he winked at Chalk, and the white horse lapsed into a
  thoughtful silence.
 And Skamperoo had been perfectly correct in his conjectures about Pinny
  Penny. When, with a resounding clunk, the King's gold crown had fallen upon
  the astonished Prime Minister, his head had gone entirely through so he was
  forced to wear it much as a dog wears a collar. But even so, he was not
  slow to realize the significance of this odd happening or the power it
  brought with it. Gripping the scepter, which had forced itself into his
  hand, he rushed into the throne room to find out what strange whim of his
  Master had made him acting King of the Realm. A glance around the throne
  room was enough to show him that Skamperoo was not there, and when he saw
  Matiah sitting so unconcernedly in the book alcove, a sudden rage and
  conviction seized him. Whatever had happened, Matiah was to blame.
 "Leave this palace at once!" shouted Pinny Penny, stamping first one foot
  and then the other. "At once, do you hear, or I'll call out the guard!"

  Matiah, still deep in the History of Oz, looked up in astonishment, and
  when he saw the little Prime Minister wearing Skamperoo's crown round his
  neck and brandishing his scepter, he gave a perfect bellow of anger and
  dismay.
 "Where's the King?" he roared, looking wildly around the throne room, "And
  why are you wearing his crown? Where's Skamperoo where're the
  necklaces?"
 "Ask yourself!" raged Pinny Penny, shaking the scepter threateningly.
  "Everything was quiet and peaceful till you and your necklaces arrived at
  this palace; there's some magic trickery about them and about you. Don't
  think I was fooled by that horse story, a horse does not appear out of the
  air. Well, now the King's gone, the horse is gone, and unless you are gone
  in ten seconds I'll have you thrown out of the window. Ten seconds, do you
  hear? This crown and scepter came to me through no wish or choice of my
  own, but since they did come to me, I AM THE KING! And I intend to rule
  this country. My first official act will be to rid myself of your filthy
  presence. Now then, start walking, merchant, and don't stop till you reach
  the border. Twenty guards will follow to see you safely out of the
  country."
 "You wait till Skamperoo hears about this!" blustered Matiah, backing away
  in alarm from the determined little Prime Minister. "I'm more important to
  him than anyone else."
 "Then why aren't you with him?" inquired Pinny Penny shrewdly. "No, wherever
  he's gone, he has gone without you. I am the King, and I do not need you,
  so be off!" Clapping his hands, Pinny gave a sharp command to the guards
  who came hurrying in answer to his summons. Retiring rapidly to escape the

  tips of their sharp spikes, Matiah sullenly began his long march. It was
  nightfall by the time the little company reached the edge of Skampavia.
  Here, in a wilderness of rock and rubble, the guardsmen left him with food
  enough for a couple of days and stern warnings never to return to
  Skampavia. Far to the west the miserable merchant could see the comforting
  lights of Merryland, but he had no desire to go there or east to the
  Kingdom of Ix. Instead, he stared hopelessly across the wilderness to where
  the heaving sands of the Deadly Desert gleamed like molten silver in the
  moonlight.
 How had that rascally monarch ever escaped without his seeing him? How could
  he ever safely cross the Deadly Desert and hope to reach Oz? How had
  Skamperoo, who seemed so dumb and foolish, ever discovered the secret of
  using the magic emeralds when he himself had failed to do so? How? How?
  How? Crouched on a flat rock, munching one of the sandwiches left by the
  guards, Matiah scowled evilly across the grim desert, his thoughts as
  treacherous and shifting as its deadly sands.
  
 CHAPTER 15
 THE DOONERS!
 All day, with only a short pause for lunch, Pigasus had flown north, Dorothy
  keeping a sharp lookout for Thunder Mountain or mountains of any sort, but
  the wild, desolate country through which they were flying was flat,
  desert-like and apparently perfectly uninhabited.
 "A fine, healthy chance we have of finding an army here!" snorted Pigasus as
  the afternoon drew to a hot, weary close. "And what we'll do when we find

  Thunder Mountain I haven't the faintest notion, have you? Even if I butt my
  nose black, blue and blunt, and you break both knuckles beating on its
  rocky exterior, how can we ever hope to enter such a place, much less
  release our unfortunate sovereigns? I told you Kalico was a scoundrel; I'll
  wager he's sent us on a wild-goose chase just to get us out of the way."
 "Ah, don't say I told you so, There's always some way, you know," said
  Dorothy, almost as downhearted as Pigasus, though she would not admit it.
  The pink pig, rather ashamed of himself, flew for several miles without
  saying anything, then, in rather a gruff voice, he called Dorothy's
  attention to the changing nature of the scenery below.
 "Notice the hills?" he snorted more hopefully. "Maybe there is a mountain,
  after all, but the sun's going down, and I'm ready to sink myself, so let's
  descend and see whether we can find a soft rock on which to lay our heads."
 "Not hills, dunes!" cried Dorothy, bouncing off as soon as Pigasus touched
  the earth. "Sand dunes; we must be near the coast and the Nonestic Ocean."
 "It does smell salty," agreed Pigasus, sniffing the air eagerly, "but
  suppose we save the ocean for tomorrow; my feet ache, my wings ache, and
  I'm hollow as a drum."
 "Then we'll have supper," decided Dorothy sensibly. So seating themselves
  comfortably with their backs against a dune, the two weary explorers
  finished up all the cold meat, fruit, pie and sandwiches Shoofenwaller had
  packed up for them. After a long, wistful sniff into the box convinced him
  there was not another crumb, Pigasus folded his wings and lay down in the
  soft sand at the foot of the dune, giving only indistinct grunts and snorts
  to Dorothy's questions and observations. Finally, getting no answer at all,
  Dorothy discovered he was asleep. The regular rise and fall of the pink

  pig's sides, the soft, drowsy singing of the west wind lulled Dorothy into
  a pleasant state of dreaminess, and presently, with her head comfortably
  pillowed on the pig's plump shoulder, she fell asleep, too.
 It must have been hours later when terrified squeals from Pigasus and the
  patter of a hundred hurrying feet made her start up in alarm. Still only
  half awake, she was startled to find herself and Pigasus surrounded by a
  horde of savage-looking sandmen. In the pale and watery moonlight they
  looked like creatures out of some very bad dream. Their bodies were roughly
  moulded of sand, their eyes strangely green and phosphorescent, while their
  hair, rising like beach grass from their pointed heads, waved about their
  lumpy faces.
 Clutching the basket that contained her small store of clothing, the Black
  Witch's powder of darkness, and Potaroo's box of stumbling blocks, Dorothy
  pressed back against the dune. Her first idea of leaping on the pig's back
  and bidding him fly was useless. Pigasus lay helplessly on his side, his
  wings and legs bound tightly with long strands of tough, strong seaweed.
  Thankful to find that she at least was free, Dorothy went a step closer to
  her struggling, squealing, furious little comrade. As she did so, a perfect
  shower of sand balls came flying toward her. The sharp sting of the
  sandmen's missiles not only awoke her completely, but goaded her into
  instant and angry action.
 "Stop that! Stop that at once!" she cried, stamping her foot indignantly,
  but her words only brought another shower of sand balls down on their
  heads.
 "You have dared to invade the sacred domain of the Dooners," yelled the

  rasping voice of the leader, rattling a long string of seashells he wore
  round his neck. "And therefore you shall be sand balled, sand bagged and
  made into sandwiches for the sand crabs!"
 If the Dooner had not looked so wild and dangerous, his foolish threat might
  have been amusing, but as he and his bandy-legged sandmen came leaping
  forward, Pigasus gave a squeal of sheer terror, and Dorothy, raising the
  basket over her head, hurled it with all her might into the midst of the
  advancing army. The effect was immediate and astonishing. Cowering down
  beside Pigasus and expecting to be seized or trampled on, Dorothy saw the
  first line of Dooners going down like a row of tenpins, then all the others
  began tumbling and tripping and falling in heaps. No sooner would a sandman
  rise than he would instantly tumble down again, and their squalls and
  screeches of rage were so piercing Dorothy put both hands over her ears.
 "It's the blocks," wheezed Pigasus, managing to lift his head a few inches.
  "Kalico's stumbling blocks are flying like fur and fury. Now if they just
  keep 'em down for a while longer, we might get away."
 Dorothy, peering sharply into the midst of the tumbling Dooners, saw the
  fifty magic squares released from their box when she flung her basket,
  fairly exploding with activity, and scramble up as they would after each
  tumble, the sandmen could not advance an inch, or even manage to stand
  erect. The leader, attempting to crawl forward on his hands and knees, was
  caught by a dozen of the whirling missiles and rolled back like a log among
  his churning comrades.
 "Hurray! Three cheers for Kalico!" puffed Pigasus. "Quick, my girl, see if
  you can untie these wretched seaweeds, and we'll be flying and be off in a
  pigwhistle."

 "I had a pair of scissors in my basket, if it hasn't fallen out, and anyway
  I'm not going without my things," declared Dorothy, now quite bold since
  the enemy had been overcome by magic. And in spite of the pig's anxious
  squeals of warning, she rushed forward, grabbed her basket and began
  picking up her scattered belongings, noting with a sigh of relief that the
  box containing the powder of darkness was still closed. With the scissors,
  still safe in the little pocket in the side of the basket, she soon clipped
  the seaweed trusses from Pigasus, and clasping the basket in her arms
  climbed swiftly on his back. Pigasus, without one backward glance, rose
  straight into the air and again headed north. Dorothy, peering fearfully
  over his left wing, saw the Dooners spring suddenly to their feet and then,
  like frightened prairie dogs, disappear into many holes in the sand.
 Funny, mused Dorothy, that they had not noticed these openings before. Funny
  that the Dooners had stopped stumbling as soon as she and Pigasus had taken
  to the air. Funny but then, everything was funny. Right in the middle
  of her conjectures, the box of stumbling blocks, now closed and tied with a
  red ribbon, dropped "plink" into the middle of her basket.
 "Someone's throwing things," gasped Pigasus, flapping his wings a bit faster
  and looking rather wildly over his shoulder.
 "No, just our box of stumbling blocks," yawned Dorothy. Now that the
  excitement was over, she felt dreadfully tired, and even the sight of the
  Nonestic Ocean rippling and gleaming a few yards ahead did not arouse or
  interest her.
 It did not interest Pigasus either. He was far from pleased to find himself
  so near the coast. "I don't like this, I don't like this at all," muttered

  the pig, perking up his ears and wiggling his nose rapidly. "We've flown
  straight north, and instead of striking Thunder Mountain, we strike the
  sea, and how could a mountain be in the middle of the sea?"
 "There are mountains on islands, and I have a notion There are plenty of
  islands out there in the ocean," said Dorothy sleepily, recalling the days
  she had studied geography in the United States.
 "Take Japan, for instance, over there Mountains are simply everywhere!"
 "I don't care if they are," answered Pigasus fiercely. "I won't go to Japan,
  and I'll not go a wing's breadth over this ocean tonight, islands or no
  islands. Sa-hay! There's the North Star to our left, so we're not going
  north at all. We're off our course, that's what we are!"
 "North Star? North Star, of course we are!" murmured Dorothy with a drowsy
  nod.
 "You're asleep," scolded Pigasus in a worried voice. "I'd better land."
 "If you land too soon, you'll strike a dune," warned Dorothy with another
  yawn. And after a quick glance below and convinced they were still over the
  Dooners' domain, Pigasus spread his wings a bit wider and swung along the
  coast looking carefully for a safe place to land and spend the rest of the
  night. He was so busy squinting downward that he never saw the long,
  curious, tube-like shadow shooting after him with incredible accuracy and
  speed. A terrific blast of air as it rushed by them on the right was his
  first warning of danger. Dorothy, too, caught unaware, gave a faint shriek
  as an immense, snake-like body curved back and began to coil round and
  round them like some gigantic air serpent.
 "It is a snake!" thought poor Dorothy as Pigasus clung helplessly in the
  little circle of air left in the center of its coils. Neither spoke, for

  truly there was nothing to say or do. Then just as the suspense grew too
  awful to be endured, the monster opened its mouth, and Dorothy, backing as
  far along the pig's back as she possibly could, almost lost her balance.
  Instead of a tongue or long tusks, out popped the head and shoulders of a
  little old man no larger than Dorothy herself.
 "Pardon me," he murmured politely, "I was looking for a sea serpent."
 "Do I look like a sea serpent?" snorted Pigasus in a quivering voice, for he
  was still half choked from shock and fright. "If you and that monster
  you're riding are looking for a sea serpent, go ahead look for one, but
  leave honest travelers alone!"
 "Monster?" exclaimed the little man in a hurt voice. "Oh, I say now, you
  have us all wrong. This is no monster, this is the long, strong, flexible,
  stretchable, SHOOTING TOWER of my private castle, and I myself am Bitty
  Bit, the Seer of Some Summit."
 In the short silence that followed Bitty Bit's astonishing announcement,
  Dorothy, examining more closely the tube-like coils encircling herself and
  Pigasus, saw that they really were of stone with rubber-like sections
  between. What she had taken for a mouth was really a window. With his elbow
  resting on the ledge, Bitty Bit was regarding them fixedly.
 "Well, even if you are a seer and have a shooting tower," grunted Pigasus,
  gathering courage as he went along, "there is no reason for you to come
  towering over us this way!"
 "But a seer must be constantly looking for things," explained Bitty Bit,
  spreading his hands expansively. "That, you know, is his business. I am
  always looking for something, and tonight it happens to be sea serpents."

 "Sorry to disappoint you," said Pigasus more mildly, "but since we are not
  sea serpents, perhaps you'll be good enough to unwind your tower. As it
  happens, I have a little looking to do myself. As a matter of fact, when
  you and your tower overtook us, I was searching for a safe place for this
  young Princess and myself to spend the night."
 "Look no more!" begged Bitty Bit, leaning so far over the sill Dorothy
  involuntarily put out her hand to save him from falling. "You shall both
  spend the night in my castle. COME!" Grasping Dorothy by one hand and
  Pigasus by one wing, the little seer with superhuman strength for one so
  small and wrinkled dragged them both through the open window of his
  shooting tower.
  
 CHAPTER 16
 THE SEER OF SOME SUMMIT
 Since coming to Oz, Dorothy had traveled in many strange ways, but to find
  herself shooting through the midnight sky in Bitty Bit's tower was surely
  the oddest of all. Both she and Pigasus stared from the window in wide-eyed
  wonder as the tower uncoiled and started shrinking rapidly backward.
 "We may as well go home at once," observed Bitty Bit, rubbing his little
  hands briskly together. "You are so much more interesting than sea
  serpents, and I can easily look for sea serpents some other night. Now
  don't be alarmed when we bump."
 "Bump?" repeated Dorothy rather nervously.
 "Of course," the sage told her calmly. "As I go forward, the tower stretches
  out in any direction I wish to go; when I return, it shrinks, contracts,
  and retires within itself like a telescope, and by the time we reach the

  castle it is no larger than an ordinary tower. Mm better hold on to
  something, we're almost there!"
 Running around the circular room a few feet from the wall was a gold
  railing. Pigasus had just time to seize it with one hand (sic hand?)
  when Bitty Bit's tower with a resounding crash snapped back, but up to a
  vertical position, so that what had been the floor of the little room
  became the east wall and the window a skylight. Dorothy and Pigasus,
  describing a complete circle on the bar, landed in a more-or-less
  upside-down position on what had been the back wall. "That's why I have it
  cushioned," explained the seer, who also had executed a neat somersault.
  Hopping up as if landing on his head was a perfectly usual and ordinary
  occurrence, Bitty Bit opened a trap door and motioned for Dorothy and
  Pigasus to follow him down a long, winding stair.
 "These magic contraptions will be the death of me," wheezed Pigasus, picking
  himself up with a groan. The cushioned floor had made his fall painless,
  but he was considerably jolted and upset from the shock, or rather the
  series of shocks that had so far punctuated their evening.
 "But if he's a seer," whispered Dorothy, recovering her basket and trotting
  eagerly after Bitty Bit, "he ought to be able to help us a"
 "Bitty Bit," sniffed the pink pig. "Well, if he'll just help me to a bed,
  I'll be satisfied!" And grunting and grumbling, he clumped sleepily down
  the stairs behind Dorothy. The room into which the stone stairway led them
  was evidently the cozy and comfortable study of the comical little seer.
  Its walls were of oak, lined from floor to ceiling with books, and all its
  furnishings were tan or brown. Dorothy considered this extremely suitable,

  as Bitty Bit himself looked like a very wise and merry Brownie. On his
  little round head was a round cap with a yellow quill, and he wore a brown,
  wrinkled robe rather like a monk's, tied tightly round the waist with a
  yellow cord. His bright, black, sharp little eyes danced with good humor
  and interest in his suntanned, honest, little face.
 While Pigasus stood sleepily and somewhat disapprovingly on the hearth rug,
  Dorothy sank into a snug brown armchair and looked expectantly up at their
  singular host.
 "No, no, not a word," begged Bitty Bit, raising his hand pleadingly.
  "Remember, I am the Seer of Some Summit, a seer who can see and foresee; a
  seer who can tell and foretell. Just by closing my eyes I can tell who you
  are, whence you came, and whither you are going."
 "Fancy that, now," observed Pigasus in a mocking voice.
 "You," retorted Bitty Bit, pointing a skinny brown finger at the pig, "you
  are a creation of my friend, the Red Jinn, whose taste for low verse I
  always knew would lead him into some mischief."
 "Low verses?" retorted Pigasus indignantly, while even Dorothy looked a
  little shocked.
 "Yes, low verses," insisted Bitty Bit solemnly. "You are so constructed that
  he who rides must rhyme and break into foolish jingles. Is this not so?"
 "They may be jingles, but they are NOT low verse," protested Pigasus,
  flapping his ears angrily.
 "Well, then, let us call them simple verses," amended Bitty Bit with a
  generous wave of the hand, "at least they are verses that anyone can
  understand, which, of course, makes them of no value whatever. People never
  appreciate what they can understand."

 "Dorothy does," declared Pigasus, now mad enough to fly right out the
  window.
 "Dorothy? Ah, yes, I was coming to her." Swinging around, Bitty Bit, his
  eyes still tightly shut, wagged his finger at the astonished little girl.
  "You are the mortal girl who came to Oz by cyclone. You live in the Emerald
  City of Oz and are"
 "Oh, tell us something we don't already know," interrupted Pigasus with a
  bored yawn. "Where is Ozma of Oz now; how could a scalawag Emperor steal
  her throne?"
 "Wait! Wait! Give me time! Not a word more not a word!" panted Bitty
  Bit, advancing with short, dancing steps toward Dorothy. "I I see a
  necklace," he muttered mysteriously. "One, two, three necklaces! I see a
  white horse and a fat, red-faced fellow wearing a small emerald crown.
  Great sea bass and sassafrass! Oz has been conquered, its inhabitants
  enchanted, its rulers banished, and the King of Skampavia sits on the
  throne."
 "So that's where he comes from!" breathed Dorothy, forgetting Bitty Bit's
  request for silence. "Oh, quick, tell us more tell us more, and help us
  to restore Ozma and the other lost sovereigns to power!"
 "I am only a seer," answered the sage, opening his eyes wide and suddenly.
  "I can see and foresee, tell and foretell, but I cannot change that which
  has happened or is about to happen."
 "But where is Ozma?" demanded Pigasus, edging closer. "If you are a seer and
  can see 'er, at least you can tell us where she is." In this way Pigasus
  hoped to check up the information given them by Potaroo, the Gnome King's

  Wizard.
 So again Bitty Bit closed his eyes and, pressing his fingers to his
  forehead, spoke: "Ozma, my old friend Jinnicky, the Wizard of Oz, a soldier
  with green whiskers, a purple horse, two Queens, two Kings, a Prince, the
  Tin Woodman, and Glinda the Good Sorceress are lying at the bottom of
  Lightning Lake, which is on the top of Thunder Mountain," Bitty Bit told
  them solemnly.
 "Lightning Lake?" cried Dorothy, seizing the little seer frantically by the
  shoulders. "Why, then, they must be drowned, burned and destroyed
  altogether!"
 "No, no, they are quite calm and as usual," Bitty Bit assured her hastily.
  "In fact, they are, I should say, in a trance of some kind."
 "But what'll we do, how'll we disenchant them or find Thunder Mountain?"
  Loosing her hold on Bitty Bit, Dorothy spun round three times and then
  started firmly for the door.
 "My shooting tower will take you to Thunder Mountain or any other place you
  decide you must go," promised Bitty Bit, hurrying anxiously after the
  little girl, "but not tonight, Dorothy, not tonight. We are all tired, and
  I must have time to think. The conquering of Oz is a great shock to me. I
  would like time to look into the matter more fully and consider all of
  these strange events in their proper order. This problem shall be my
  pillow. I'll sleep on it, my dear, and in the morning will doubtless have
  something helpful to suggest."
 "Well, then, where're the beds?" yawned Pigasus, who heartily approved of
  Bitty Bit's suggestion. "Or are we to sleep on our problems, too?" At this,
  Bitty Bit, who seemed to find Pigasus terribly amusing, laughed right out

  loud, then taking Dorothy's arm he led the way to a snug little bedroom all
  done in yellow. Pigasus had a gentlemanly apartment in tan next door, and
  both were so weary they spent little time examining their new quarters, but
  instead went directly to bed and to sleep.
 When Dorothy wakened next morning, she looked out the window and saw Pigasus
  flying in slow circles round the tidy castle. Bitty Bit's brown stone
  palace, though small and unpretentious, perched right on top of Some
  Summit, and the view was so fine and the mountain air so fresh and
  invigorating, Dorothy, in spite of all her anxiety and worry, began to feel
  happy and reckless and ready for anything. With cheerful little glances
  round her cozy yellow room, she dressed, brushed her hair till it shone,
  then skipped merrily down the brown marble steps and out into the garden.
  The garden, really a series of sloping terraces, was bright with hardy
  mountain posies, with spicy sage bushes and gnarled old trees which clung
  like acrobats to the steep rocks and dangerous crevices. Pigasus, catching
  a glimpse of Dorothy seated on a smooth rock near a little waterfall, came
  swooping down to wish her a merry morning.
 "Not a bad little palace," remarked the pig considerately. "Not a bad little
  palace at all, though so far as I can see there's not a manservant or a
  woman servant or even a ladybug about. I imagine this fellow is a hermit
  and from the looks of him probably lives on tobacco and snuff. What do you
  suppose are the chances for breakfast?"
 "I don't know," said Dorothy, refusing to allow such a small matter as
  breakfast to dash her spirits. "Have you seen Bitty Bit this morning?"
 "Yes," sniffed Pigasus, beginning to poke his nose hungrily round the roots

  of a dwarf oak, "before I flew out my window I saw him going into his brown
  study. Seer goes into brown study. How's that for the first announcement of
  the day?"
 "You're awful," laughed Dorothy, giving Pigasus a little push.
 "No, just awfully hungry," grinned Pigasus. "Now I've been thinking"
 "NO?" Stepping out from behind a sizable bush, Bitty Bit regarded the pig
  with an air of assumed amazement. "He says he's been thinking," he
  repeated, turning solemnly to Dorothy. "Must be the air up here."
 "That's about all I've had," retorted Pigasus, savagely crunching an acorn
  between his teeth, "that and a nibble from one of your sage bushes."
 "Sage bush, eh?" chuckled Bitty Bit, winking at Dorothy. "That's good, and
  we'll make a sage of you yet, a sausage!" he whispered in an undertone that
  Pigasus heard quite distinctly. "And speaking of sausage, how about
  breakfast?"
 Though Bitty Bit's remark about the sausage still rankled, Pigasus was too
  hungry to let it keep him from following the seer into a small, walled
  garden that opened out from the larger dining hall of his castle. Here, on
  a small table covered with a gay yellow cloth, was assembled the most
  appetizing breakfast Dorothy ever had tasted. Ripe melon and apricots,
  cereal and eggs, tiny meat pies, pancakes and honey, hot rolls and steaming
  brown cocoa. There was a huge bowl of mush and cream for Pigasus and
  another of buttermilk, and under the soothing influence of his favorite
  foods, Pigasus completely forgot his annoyance, and they were soon
  chattering away like old friends at a Sunday School Picnic.
 Bitty Bit's chef, whom the pig had overlooked in his grand tour of the
  palace, served them with skill and speed. No wonder Pigasus had not seen

  him, for he was even smaller than his wrinkled little Master and almost
  completely enveloped in a great brown linen apron and tall brown cap.
  Dorothy could not possibly eat all the dainties pressed upon her by the
  kind little seer and his chef, but she nibbled at each course, and when
  Bitty Bit saw that neither she nor Pigasus could down another bite, he
  swallowed the rest of his cocoa and bounced briskly to his feet.
 "Now," he cried, tossing away his gay napkin with a flourish. "Now for the
  Emerald City and Oz!"
 "But I thought we were going to Thunder Mountain," exclaimed Dorothy,
  pushing back her chair so hurriedly she bumped her head on the wall.
 "That," exclaimed Bitty Bit, looking over his shoulder, for he was already
  halfway through the door, "that will not be necessary. All we need to save
  the celebrities of Oz is the long-lost wishing emeralds of Lorna the Wood
  Nymph."
 "Lorna?" coughed Pigasus, rolling out of his seat and falling a bit
  sideways. "For pretty sake, who's she?"
 "Oh, come along!" urged Dorothy, and without wasting another second she
  pelted into the brown palace after Bitty Bit. With a groan Pigasus
  followed, and groaned again when he realized he would have to climb three
  flights of marble steps and a flight of stone to reach the famous shooting
  tower. Then, suddenly and joyfully remembering his wings, he spread them
  wide.
 "Wings, hold me up," mumbled the pink pig stuffily, "we're carrying entirely
  too mush mush!" Rising rather uncertainly, he breathlessly flapped his way
  up to the tower room where Dorothy and Bitty Bit impatiently awaited him.

  
 CHAPTER 17
 SKAMPEROO IN OZ
 In the company of Scraps, the Scarecrow, the Royal Visitors, and all the
  amusing members of Ozma's court, the Emperor of Oz and Chalk passed a gay
  and hilarious morning. The tableaux and pageants proceeded without a single
  hitch, and no one seemed to miss Dorothy or Pigasus at all, nor did anyone
  notice the omission of the carefully planned groups showing the Wizard's
  arrival in Oz, Dorothy's first visit to the Emerald City, or the victory of
  Nick Chopper over the wolves. These interesting and historical events might
  just as well never have happened. Notta's circus later in the afternoon
  went off with a bang, even without Pigasus to jump through hoops and fly
  round the ring waving flags while Scraps did her balance-defying acts on
  the trapeze and tightrope. The picnic supper was even more fun than the
  circus, and the fireworks, set off by Tik Tok, who was in no danger of
  scorching himself, the best of all. Indeed, Skamperoo's first day in the
  Emerald City had been so full and so interesting he had not made a single
  wish or once thought of his magic emeralds.
 "Funny we never had jolly times like this at home," mused Skamperoo, putting
  out the emerald stars in the ceiling that pleasantly lighted his green
  apartment and burrowing happily down into his splendid green bed. "Oh,
  Chalk! Are you asleep there, old horse?" As no answer came from the other
  bed, Skamperoo let himself sink a bit deeper into the luxurious nest of
  silken covers and soon was asleep himself, puffing and whistling like a
  steamboat.
 But the strange and frightful snoring of the Emperor did not seem to stop or

  scare away the shadowy figure that presently came stealing into the Royal
  Chamber. Once, twice, three times, long skinny fingers reached out toward
  the thick neck of the snoring ruler of Oz. The fourth time there were three
  distinct little clips, and when the curving, talon-like claw withdrew, it
  had in its clutching grasp the three powerful wishing chains. Then, without
  waking the occupant of either bed, the thief stole quietly into the
  shadows.
 Now the Scarecrow, delighted with the success of the celebration so far, had
  suggested a series of athletic contests and obstacle races for next day,
  and Skamperoo had heartily agreed to his plans. His first thought on waking
  was the race to be run by the straw man and himself, the Scarecrow on the
  wooden sawhorse, he on his splendid white charger.
 "I'll wear the white leather breeches and shirt," puffed Skamperoo, bounding
  out of bed like a schoolboy. He had taken a shower and donned his showy
  riding clothes before he missed his magic emeralds. Then, all at once, as
  he stood before the mirror to comb his hair, he gave a loud squall of
  anguish. "Chalk! Chalk!" roared the distracted Emperor, racing over to the
  balcony and leaning so far out over the railing he nearly fell on his
  crown. "They're gone! They're gone! My emeralds! My necklaces! My
  necklaces! My emeralds!"
 Now Chalk, who had risen early to nibble the clover while it was still fresh
  with morning dew, looked up in alarm, then as his Master's voice grew
  louder and louder and his gestures more spectacular and desperate, the
  white horse rose up on his hind legs and shook his head in violent warning
  and displeasure. "Hush!" he directed in a low voice. "I'll be right up."

  Making his way quickly but cautiously so as not to arouse the curiosity of
  any of the palace servants already at work in the lower hallways, Chalk
  hurried up to the agitated Emperor.
 "They're g-g-gone!" blubbered Skamperoo, sitting on the edge of the bed and
  crying like a baby. "G-g-g-gone! Now everything is ruined, and I'll have
  nothing left at all!"
 "Well, you still have me," murmured Chalk, resting his head affectionately
  on Skamperoo's shoulder. "Brace up, Kingaling, and for oats sake be
  quiet! No one here knows about the necklaces, and until the rascal who has
  stolen them learns how to use them wee are as safe as soap. That rascal, of
  course, is Matiah. Somehow he has managed to cross the Deadly Desert. Yes,"
  Chalk shook his mane wrathfully, "I am convinced that Matiah has the
  necklaces, but what good are they to him when we alone know the secret that
  makes them work? He'll have to come to us in the end, and when he does!
  Hah!" Chalk expelled the air from his nose in a terrific snort. "Just let
  me take care of him."
 "But shouldn't we give the alarm, have a search made for him, and try to
  recover the emeralds?"
 "Let him alone," counseled the wishing horse firmly. "The thing for you to
  do is to sit tight on the throne of Oz. Remember, you are still the
  Emperor!"
 "But how can I be, without those emeralds?" Skamperoo dabbed at his eyes
  with the satin bedsheet.
 "We got along all right yesterday," said Chalk calmly. "Come, cheer up,
  Skamper, everything will be ALL right."
 "I rather counted on beating the Scarecrow in that race this morning,"

  muttered Skamperoo wistfully. "How can you run as fast as that tireless
  wooden creature who was magically brought to life?"
 "Well, wasn't I magically brought to life?" The white horse shook his mane
  roguishly. "Come along, Kingaling, we'll not only win that race, but we'll
  have back our necklaces and chase Matiah out of Oz before we are through."
 "I I really believe you can do anything," sighed Skamperoo, getting
  almost cheerfully to his feet. "But just the same, I shall keep a sharp
  outlook for Matiah. He might start a revolution."
 "He'll revolute pretty rapidly if I once get my heels on him," promised
  Chalk with a wicked grin. "Come on. Heads up, and who's afraid?" However,
  in spite of the white horse's valiant attempts to comfort him, Skamperoo
  spent a troubled and uneasy day, casting fearful glances behind him when no
  one was looking, searching the happy holiday crowds with haggard glances
  for a glimpse of the long, thin face of Matiah the merchant. Even when
  Chalk beat the Sawhorse in their long, exciting race through the park and
  the crowds cheered themselves hoarse with delight and approval, the victory
  was spoiled by the knowledge that somewhere in the Emerald City lurked his
  most dangerous and relentless foe.
 Chalk, too, though he pretended to regard the matter lightly, was almost as
  worried as his Master and spent every free moment poking his head into
  doorways and peering down side streets and rearing up over walls. And while
  Skamperoo was having his afternoon nap, the white horse systematically
  searched the palace from top to bottom, even the cellar.
 But in the cellar Chalk did not go quite far enough, for it was in a
  hollowed-out chamber under the cellar that the merchant of Skampavia was

  really hidden. Here, with a goodly supply of food stolen from the pantry,
  Matiah had seriously settled down to work out the problem of the emerald
  necklace. He had meant to conceal himself in the cellar itself, but when
  his foot brushed against an iron ring in the floor, he had lifted it up and
  discovered to his delight and satisfaction this still-more-secluded and
  safe retreat.
 The tunnels and rocky chambers below the Palace had been constructed and
  used by Ruggedo, the old Gnome King, when he was plotting to capture the
  Emerald City. Ruggedo himself had been captured, but the underground caves
  and passageways had been left pretty much as they were. There were a number
  of chairs, a rough bed and table, and numerous candles and lamps.
  Altogether it made an ideal workshop for the merchant to try out his
  experiments. In the cellar he might easily have been discovered by any of
  the kitchen boys sent down for supplies, but in Ruggedo's old hideout he
  could be sure of complete privacy. Lighting the largest of the lamps that
  hung on its rusty chain over the table, Matiah seated himself on a rickety
  old chair and prepared to concentrate with all his will power on the
  glittering emeralds. In the sickly green light he made a strange and
  sinister figure as he bent over the table, mumbling and chattering to
  himself. But after a whole day, during which he tried every known formula
  and combination, touching each gem in succession as he made his wish and
  counted to a hundred, he was still no nearer the solution of the mystery
  than he had been in Skampavia.
 First he had tried the diamond clasp of the third necklace, sure that that
  was the key to their power. But nothing at all had happened, and the trick
  of the magic emeralds continued to elude him. To have in his fingers the

  means to immense power and good fortune and still be unable to benefit was
  so infuriating, Matiah began to stamp, splutter, and beat his chest with
  rage and disappointment. Was it for this he had bribed a red eagle with the
  promise of three wishes to carry him across the Deadly Desert? Even now the
  mammoth bird was waiting impatiently on the edge of a little wood near the
  City ready to tear him to pieces if he failed to fulfill his part of the
  bargain.
 No daylight penetrated into the tunneled chamber, and hardly realizing that
  it was now midnight, Matiah from sheer weariness and exasperation finally
  gave up and fell asleep, his head on the table, his hands still clutching
  the provoking chains. Footsteps pattering overhead wakened him at last, and
  also told him someone had come to the cellar for supplies. Stretching
  wearily, he rose and, going over to the stone steps, cautiously ascended
  and lifted the trapdoor. Now thoroughly convinced that the necklaces would
  not work unless worn by someone else, he determined to seize the first
  person entering the cellar and compel him to help.
  The merchant did not have long to wait. All unconscious of the part he was
  to play in Matiah's dark schemes, a young Kitchen Boy came whistling his
  way toward a great, golden bin of potatoes. The bin was just beyond the
  trapdoor, and lowering it to a mere crack, Matiah let the boy pass. Then,
  as he leaned down to fill his basket, the wily merchant flung up the
  trapdoor, fell upon the boy, and carried him kicking and screaming down the
  stairs. Here with threats, promises and innumerable shakings, he finally
  reduced the poor lad to a state of frightened submission. With the
  sparkling necklaces round his neck, he touched one and then another of the

  emeralds as Matiah wished and counted and counted and wished. After each
  unsuccessful trial the merchant would rage and stamp and shake his fists
  till the boy was quite convinced he was in the presence and power of a
  madman and frantically waited for someone to overhear Matiah's ravings and
  come down to rescue him. But nobody did!
 While the unfortunate Kitchen Boy was spending a miserable morning in the
  underground chamber, Skamperoo and Chalk were going through the motions of
  enjoying themselves above stairs, but without any real zest or pleasure.
  Only half-heartedly Skamperoo laughed at the jokes of the Scarecrow, and
  Chalk, for all his bright interest in the long recital of Kabumpo's
  adventures, was really in a fidget of uneasiness, trying to keep an eye on
  all the doors and windows in the Throne Room at once.
 Something was going to happen. The white horse felt it in every bone. And
  just as the soft musical gong sounded the call for luncheon, his worst
  fears were realized. Suddenly, without reason or warning, the castle was
  plunged into total darkness. Thumps, bumps, hysterical shouts and screams
  followed closely on the heels of this disconcerting event. Chalk, who had
  been standing back of Skamperoo, immediately leaned forward and grasped his
  impetuous little Master by the seat of his Royal Breeches.
 "Be still!" commanded the white horse through his teeth and the white
  leather of Skamperoo's riding pants, and he held on for dear life as the
  Emperor, like all the rest of the court and guests, tried to rush in every
  direction.
 "He's done it! He's done it, and everything is ruined," wailed Skamperoo,
  struggling in vain to pull away from Chalk. "Matiah has discovered the
  secret of the necklaces, and now we are ruined. Do you hear? Ruined!"

 "I hear," hissed Chalk, giving Skamperoo a little shake, "and so will
  everyone else unless you shut your mouth. Be quiet, I tell you; do nothing
  till the right moment, unless you want to dash out your brains against a
  pillar in the dark." Too frightened to argue or struggle further, Skamperoo
  at last subsided. All about, courtiers, servants, and guests were screaming
  and bumping into each other or the furniture, and when a stern hand
  suddenly seized his bridle, Chalk trembled violently in spite of himself.
 "Follow me," directed a firm, stern little voice, "and no harm will come to
  you..." Now Chalk had been expecting to see or hear Matiah, and the sound
  of this small, strange voice was a welcome relief and surprise. Taking a
  firmer hold on Skamperoo, he thrust out his head in an endeavor to touch or
  feel the newcomer. As he did so, the hand on his bridle began to tug him
  gently but firmly forward.
 "Look out there, mind what you are about, the Emperor of Oz is just ahead!"
  whinnied Chalk, now thoroughly alarmed. "We are not used to taking orders
  from strangers."
 "Oh, we won't be strangers long," promised the strange voice pleasantly. "So
  THIS is the Emperor of Oz, and is this the way you usually carry him?"
 "Come ON, Bitty Bit, what's the use of all this arguing?" put in another
  voice impatiently. "Let's get out of this confusion. The Wizard's
  laboratory is right across the hall. Tell him to come there."
 "A girl!" decided Chalk with another gulp of relief. "Maybe we are not so
  badly off, after all!" And lifting his head in spite of Skamperoo's great
  weight, he spoke proudly and confidently, "Whoever you are, we welcome you
  to Oz, and if you can explain this unearthly and unexpected darkness, we

  will gladly follow you and do as you say."
 "Good!" chuckled Bitty Bit, tugging manfully at his bridle. "This way,
  please." There was still so much screaming and confusion in the Throne
  Room, no one had overheard the conversation between the newcomers and the
  Emperor's horse, and guided by the invisible hand Chalk crossed the room
  without bumping into anything or anybody. A moment later they were in the
  dark, quiet laboratory that had once belonged to the Wizard of Oz.
  
 CHAPTER 18
 THE EMPEROR'S HORSE MAKES A BARGAIN
 Bitty Bit's shooting tower had made a record trip to the Emerald City, and
  guided by the little Seer of Some Summit had come to a deft and dexterous
  stop right outside the windows of the great Throne Room. After a short,
  anxious look inside and before anyone was aware of their arrival, Dorothy
  removed the lid from the box of the powder of darkness and threw a generous
  pinch into the air, plunging the Emerald City into an instant and
  thunderous dark. Under cover of this magic darkness, Dorothy, Pigasus and
  Bitty Bit boldly entered the palace and singled out the white horse and his
  terrified Master. They had fully expected some resistance Dorothy had
  brought a long piece of rope, and Pigasus carried a stout club under his
  wing but they were delighted to find the Emperor too frightened and his
  white horse too clever to resist an invisible foe.
 Being able to see in the dark themselves, they had Chalk and Skamperoo at a
  decided advantage. Dorothy's plans, now that they had actually returned to
  the Emerald City, were rather vague, but Bitty Bit knew just what he hoped
  and intended to do. His seerish powers had enabled him to discover that all

  the changes in Oz had been brought about by the magic emeralds which in
  some way had fallen into Skamperoo's hands, and these emeralds Bitty Bit
  meant to have at the earliest possible moment. So first he ordered all the
  windows and doors to the laboratory closed, then, annoyed by the screams
  and crashes still issuing from every room in the castle, he advised Dorothy
  to put the lid back on the powder of darkness.
 "But supposing someone disturbs us before we finish," objected Pigasus,
  looking doubtfully at the tremendous warhorse who stood with feet braced
  and ears back ready to listen or defy them. Somehow Chalk had managed to
  toss Skamperoo back into the saddle, and with both hands fixed grimly in
  the horse's mane the Emperor was blinking his eyes in a vain attempt to see
  them or catch a glimpse of Matiah, for he was convinced that the merchant
  was at the bottom of the whole procedure.
 "If we agree to lift this pall of darkness, will you agree to grant us an
  uninterrupted hour of your time?" asked Bitty Bit, turning toward the
  Emperor, but really addressing the horse, whom he considered the better man
  of the two.
 "I think we can, without undue danger, promise that," answered Chalk
  guardedly, while Skamperoo hemmed and hawed with indecision. "Of course,
  you must promise to use no more magic against us."
 "Well, the same goes for you, too, remember," put in Pigasus quickly. "An
  hour's time and conversation and no trickery."
 "But who who are you?" muttered Skamperoo, finding his voice at last. "I
  seem to hear three different voices."
 "You'll soon see," answered Dorothy, clapping the lid on her powder of

  darkness. With a suddenness that made them all gasp, the laboratory was
  again flooded with the bright noon sunshine, and in a determined row before
  him Skamperoo saw a pretty little girl in green, a fat pink pig with white
  wings, and a small, wrinkled old gentleman in brown.
 "W-why," whinnied Chalk, drawing in a deep breath of relief, "at first I
  thought you were enemies, but now I see that you are merely visitors and
  friends."
 "That depends," observed Bitty Bit, seating himself on a tall stool that
  brought him on a level with Chalk's nose. "I am the Seer of Some Summit,
  but these others are Princess Dorothy and Pigasus, the Winged Pig. They
  really belong in this palace and are close friends of the rightful ruler of
  this country, Ozma of Oz!"
 "I am the rightful ruler of Oz!" shouted Skamperoo, growing red in the face
  and thrusting out his three chins belligerently.
 "Oh, don't bother putting on a show for me," exclaimed Bitty Bit, waving his
  arms impatiently. "Remember, I am a Seer, I know all, I see all, and what
  is more, I TELL ALL! You, my pretty fellow, are really the King of
  Skampavia, a small, no-count country on the other side of the Deadly
  Desert. In some way the long-lost necklaces of Lorna the Wood Nymph have
  come into your possession. With these necklaces you have enchanted the
  people of Oz into believing you are their ruler. You have wickedly banished
  Ozma and her allies and counselors and unlawfully made yourself Emperor of
  Oz."
 "That seems to cover everything," drawled Chalk as Skamperoo turned from red
  to purple.
 "Not everything!" went on Bitty Bit, shaking his finger sternly under

  Chalk's nose. "Kingdoms are not won and held by trickery, my friends, and
  we are here to see that those necklaces are returned and the Kingdom of Oz
  restored to its proper rulers."
 "And suppose we refuse!" suggested the white horse in a bored voice. "What
  then?"
 "Why then," Bitty Bit threw back his shoulders and spun round several times
  on his shiny stool, "why then, it means WAR!" Bitty Bit did not say who
  were his friends or allies or where he should get his armies, but he spoke
  with such firm confidence, both Skamperoo and Chalk were taken aback and
  completely dismayed. Matiah had been bad enough, but this strange and
  determined little Seer was worse.
 "Perhaps we can make a bargain or come to some agreement," suggested Chalk,
  resolved to save what he could for himself and his Master. "Suppose King
  Skamperoo and I agree to return the emerald necklaces, which undoubtedly
  belong in Oz, will you grant us the privilege of using them twice for
  ourselves?"
 "But but " Skamperoo was about to blurt out the fact that they no
  longer had the necklaces when Chalk gave him a savage nip on the leg which
  silenced him effectively.
 "Why should we do that?" inquired Pigasus, fluttering his wings nervously.
  "After all the grief and worry you have caused us, you are lucky to get off
  with your skins."
 "Where are the necklaces now?" asked Dorothy, stepping close to Chalk and
  looking eagerly up into the face of the discomfited Emperor. Skamperoo's
  face grew long as a balloon suddenly punctured, but remembering Chalk's

  last bite, he managed to keep silent.
 "When you have answered OUR question, we will answer yours," stated Chalk,
  firmly but pleasantly. "You can, of course, appeal to the Court and members
  of the household, but I think you will find them entirely satisfied with
  their present Emperor and ready to stand by him to the last man." At
  Chalk's words, Bitty Bit looked rather crestfallen. As the white horse had
  so quietly stated, they were perfectly powerless to take the necklaces by
  force, and quick inspection of the Emperor when he first reached the palace
  had convinced him Skamperoo was not wearing the precious emeralds. At this
  rather embarrassing moment a series of thumps, kicks, and knocks on the
  door made not only the rescuers but the Emperor and Chalk turn rather pale.
 "Oh! Oh! It's Matiah!" quavered Skamperoo, whose nerves were completely
  shaken by the shocking disclosures of the last few moments. "Oh! Oh!
  What'll we do now?"
 "Hold your tongue," advised Chalk, and swinging round he trotted briskly
  over to the door.
 "Who's there?" he demanded in a dignified voice.
 "'Tis I Iva the Kitchen Boy!" stuttered a frightened treble. "I
  must see the Emperor at once."
 "Well, shall we let him in?" Bitty Bit looked uneasily at Pigasus and
  Dorothy and then rather thoughtfully at Chalk.
 "Suit yourselves," yawned the white horse indifferently. "It's probably a
  messenger telling us the pudding is cold with all this delay and darkness.
  You asked for an hour's time and conversation and we agreed to that demand,
  so it is for you to decide what to do, not us."
 "Oh, let him in," fumed Pigasus, "and tell him to stop this hammering and

  yammering. What harm is there in a Kitchen Boy?"
 So Bitty Bit, taking the key from the lock and squinting through the keyhole
  to assure himself there was only a small boy outside, quickly admitted him.
  Now in darted Iva, screaming loudly of a madman in the cellar and bursting
  into tearful and incoherent recital of his woes. Scarcely had he got out
  two sentences before Skamperoo fell bodily off his horse and made a
  desperate snatch at the Kitchen Boy's throat. But Bitty Bit was too quick
  for him. His eyes, too, had caught the glimmer of emeralds, and jerking the
  three chains from the lad's neck as Chalk made a savage lunge forward, he
  tossed them to Pigasus. Catching them on his nose as cleverly as a trained
  seal, the pink pig spread his wings and flew up to the top of a tall
  cabinet, where he sat panting and puffing with satisfaction and defiance.
 "Come down, you fat scoundrel!" roared Skamperoo, dancing up and down like a
  dervish, while the poor Kitchen Boy, outraged by the way both Skamperoo and
  Bitty Bit had rushed upon him, burst into loud sobs and, rushing out the
  still open door, ran crying down the corridor. Slamming the door and
  locking it after him, Bitty Bit rather anxiously waited for Chalk's next
  move, and as usual Chalk was quite prepared and ready to make it.
 "Well," he observed with a jaunty flick of his tail, "now that you have the
  famous wishing emeralds, I suppose you are satisfied, and we may as well
  go. Come along, Skamperoo, you will get nowhere in an argument with a pig.
  Just casting pearls before swine, you know, and he already has our
  emeralds!"
 "You mean your wishing necklaces!" shrieked Pigasus furiously. "And I'll
  tell you what I wish. I wish that you and your silly Master were clams at

  the bottom of the Nonestic Ocean!" Thoroughly shocked and startled by the
  pink pig's unexpected wish, Bitty Bit and Dorothy rushed toward the
  cabinet, hoping in some way to prevent the wish from taking effect. But
  they need not have worried, for of course nothing happened at all. Then
  Skamperoo, urged by Chalk, hastily climbed into the saddle.
 "Well," whinnied the white horse, twitching his ears provokingly, "goodbye
  to you. Goodbye! We'll just be trotting along."
 "Wait! Look here, hold on a bit." The little Seer of Some Summit stepped
  angrily in front of the white horse. "How do these emeralds work, how are
  we to disenchant the rulers of Oz and restore Ozma to the throne unless we
  know the proper way to use these magic chains?"
 "I'm afraid that's YOUR problem," sighed Chalk, rolling his eyes round at
  Skamperoo. "Come now, my little mannikin, open up the door. We kept our
  promise, and you must keep yours. After all, my Master has done no real
  harm here. There has been no war or bloodshed. In fact, everything has been
  decidedly gay and jolly. If his laudable ambition to better himself brought
  Ozma and her counselors a little well-earned rest, at least they have
  suffered no pain or unpleasantness and are perfectly unaware of what has
  happened to them. Open the door, I tell you, or I'll call for help, and
  there are many in this palace who would gladly come to our assistance."
 "Oh! Oh! What shall we do?" wailed Dorothy as Bitty Bit stood uncertainly
  with his back to the door. "You're the horridest horse I've ever known!"
 "Well, that's all in the way you look at me," answered Chalk, staring
  steadily into Dorothy's eyes. "You, my dear, are fond of your Mistress,
  Queen Ozma of Oz, and are trying to help her. I, on my part, am exceedingly
  fond of my Master, the King of Skampavia, and am trying to help him. You

  can't blame me for that, you know."
 "The creature is right," sighed Bitty Bit, "and we'll have to agree to his
  plans, preposterous though they are."
 "That would, of course, be the sensible thing to do," murmured Chalk,
  lowering his eyes modestly. "You grant me two wishes, and I will tell you
  the proper way to use the magic wishing chains."
 "But suppose they are bad wishes I mean," Bitty Bit corrected himself
  hastily, "good for you, but bad for us, what then? With the necklaces in
  your possession, you could wish yourselves away in an instant."
 "That," admitted Chalk, "is perfectly true, but I am afraid you will have to
  take that chance and trust me."
 "Never do it! Never do it!" squealed Pigasus, who now had the necklaces
  tucked tightly under his wing. "We might as well throw ourselves out of the
  window."
 But Bitty Bit, closing his eyes and pressing his fingers close to his
  forehead, made no reply. "I'll trust you," he said after a short silence,
  and opening his eyes, he looked cheerfully up at the white horse. "Hand
  down those necklaces, Pigasus, and be quick about it, too; I hear footsteps
  in the passageway."
 "Well, don't blame me if we're turned to pretzels and pumpernickel," grunted
  the pig, dropping the necklaces into the seer's outstretched hand.
  "Goodbye, all." Turning his back in disgust and covering his ears with his
  wings, Pigasus waited in fear and trembling for the end. But Bitty Bit
  quite calmly handed the emeralds to Skamperoo, and Skamperoo immediately
  draped them over Chalk's left ear.

 "Now, then," murmured Chalk, looking firmly back at the unhappy Emperor,
  "repeat exactly what I say, and all will yet be well. I wish," began Chalk,
  while Skamperoo listened with bulging eyes, "I wish that the five wishes I
  make when we return to Skampavia shall be instantly granted." As Skamperoo
  repeated the wish and slowly started to count to a hundred, Dorothy
  fidgeted with uneasiness, and Pigasus fairly groaned with alarm, for it
  seemed to them both that their danger had only been postponed and not
  averted.
 "My second wish I will keep for our return," decided Chalk. "Now, my dear,
  attend closely. Since you are the avowed friend of Ozma and live with her
  in this palace, it seems to me you are the one to keep safely the secret of
  the magic emeralds." Moving close to Dorothy, Chalk put his soft, pink nose
  close to her ear and whispered several very hoarse sentences. "Get it? Get
  it?" he demanded, backing away exuberantly.
 "Oh is THAT all?" Dorothy pushed back her hair in surprise and
  bewilderment. "Why, anyone could do that!"
 "Then prove it by sending us back to Skampavia," beamed Chalk, shaking his
  mane approvingly. "It would be embarrassing for us to be here when Ozma and
  her friends return. Here, my child, take the necklaces, and I'll do the
  wishing." Pigasus, now more interested than frightened, tried his best to
  see what Dorothy did after she clasped the emeralds around her neck, and
  the white horse solemnly wished himself and Skamperoo back in Skampavia,
  but before Chalk reached ten in his counting, there was a whiff and puff,
  and except for a slight rustle in the air, no sign at all of the splendid
  white steed and his red-faced Master.
 "It works! It works!" exulted Bitty Bit, hopping about like a Brownie. "Can

  you do it again, my dear? All we need to do is to wish that the people of
  Oz shall be released from this wicked spell of forgetting and then wish
  Ozma and all the others safely back to this palace."
 "Don't forget Highboy!" cried Pigasus, switching his little tail violently.
  "He's gone, too, you know, and don't forget Jinnicky and old Willy Green
  Whiskers!"
 "I'll remember!" promised Bitty Bit. "All ready, Dorothy?" The little girl
 nodded, and Bitty Bit, looking and feeling more serious and important than
  he had ever felt in his whole little life, slowly made the wish that was to
  restore peace and happiness to Oz.
 "I wish," said the little sage sternly, "that the wicked enchantment cast by
  Skamperoo upon the inhabitants of Oz be instantly dispelled. I wish that
  Ozma herself, the Wizard of Oz, the Red Jinn of Ev, the King and Queen of
  the Munchkins and their son Prince Philador, the King and Queen of the
  Gillikens and their giant horse, Glinda the Good Sorceress of the South,
  Nick Chopper the Tin Emperor of the East, and the Soldier with the Green
  Whiskers be immediately released from Thunder Mountain and restored to this
  palace. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven."
 At seven Pigasus with a loud squall of astonishment fell from the top of the
  cabinet, and Dorothy rushed joyfully forward. For now every chair around
  the Wizard's table was occupied. At the head sat Ozma, calm and gracious as
  ever; at the foot the spry little Wizard; and between, all the others who
  had so recently lain at the bottom of Lightning Lake. Highboy stood over by
  the window looking dreamily out across the garden, and none of them seemed
  in the least surprised or excited to find themselves in the Wizard's

  laboratory.
 "Let me see " mused Ozma, raising her hand gravely, "Ah, yes, we are here
  to discuss a threatened danger to ourselves and the Kingdom of Oz."
 "But it's all over now," cried Dorothy, running over to Ozma and flinging
  both arms round her waist. "It's all over, and we're safe and you're safe
  and my, how glad we are to have you back here again!"
 "Here!" exclaimed the Wizard, popping up like a startled Jack-in-the-Box.
  "Where else would we be?"
 "Only at the bottom of Lightning Lake in Thunder Mountain," murmured Bitty
  Bit, coming modestly forward to meet the Fairy Ruler of Oz and winking
  merrily at Jinnicky, whom he already knew."
  
 CHAPTER 19
 THE STORY OF THE NECKLACES
 Ozma's surprise and the astonishment of all the rest of that company around
  the Wizard's table can well be imagined.
 "I didn't hear any thunder," snorted Highboy, lowering himself down to Bitty
  Bit's level. "Not a clap! And if we were at the bottom of Lightning Lake,
  what did we eat?"
 "We didn't!" announced Jinnicky in a hollow voice, "What COULD we have eaten
  in such a place, you old fire-eater, you?" To have been enchanted and put
  out of existence for three whole days was an amazing experience, and as
  Dorothy and Bitty Bit, helped out now and then by Pigasus, explained all
  that had happened to the victims of Skamperoo's ambition and to themselves
  in the course of their journey of rescue, Ozma's face grew both grave and
  serious. It was disturbing to realize how easily Oz had been captured and

  the powerful Wizards and Glinda the Sorceress pushed aside. The Wizard of
  Oz himself seemed to feel the most discouraged and downcast of all to think
  he had been so easily overcome, and that his magic had not been strong
  enough to withstand the wicked spell of the invaders.
 "I should have foreseen something like this and been prepared," mourned the
  little man, mopping his head with a map of Oz which he happened to have in
  his pocket.
 "Yes," sighed the Tin Woodman, feeling his joints anxiously to see whether
  they had been rusted by his three-day immersion in Lightning Lake, "we
  might have been prisoners in Thunder Mountain forever had it not been for
  Dorothy and Pigasus and this sagacious little Seer. But tell me, Dorothy,
  how is it that you alone of all the people in the palace remembered and
  missed us?"
 "Well," confessed Dorothy, seating herself cautiously on Nick Chopper's tin
  knees, "it must have been the Wizard's wishing pill. You see, just as the
  Soldier's beard turned red, I found one in my pocket and popping it into my
  mouth wished that I might save Oz from any danger that threatened. It kept
  me from forgetting Ozma and all of you, and when I sat on Pigasus' back, he
  remembered, too, and we"
 "Did save Oz!" finished the little Wizard, bounding triumphantly to his feet
  and restored to instant cheerfulness by Dorothy's generous statement. "I
  tell you, I'll match my wishing powers with any wishing powers in the
  country!"
 "But you won't have to now," smiled Bitty Bit with an envious glance at the
  sparkling necklaces Dorothy had placed on the table before Ozma. "With

  these emeralds and your own magic powers, nothing like this could ever
  happen in Oz again."
 "Thank you, Bitty Bit," smiled the little Queen, nodding graciously. "Thank
  you a hundred times for all you have done for us and for Oz, and perhaps,
  if we coaxed, you might remain as our Royal Seer."
 "Hear, here, our Royal Seer!" cried Pigasus, clapping his wings. "Will you
  be it, Sir Bitty Bit?"
 "Well," acknowledged Bitty Bit with a low bow toward Ozma, "I'm tempted to
  accept, but on the other hand, I am so foolishly fond of my own castle I
  just could not be content in any other place. But if Your Majesty ever
  needs me for serious business, you can always command my services by using
  either the wishing necklaces or your magic belt."
 "And he'll come like a shot in his shooting tower," Dorothy smiled as she
  slid carefully from Nick Chopper's knee. "But say, what's that?" A hundred
  footsteps sounded in the corridor, accompanied by confused voices,
  questioning calls and finally loud thumps on the door. "It must be all the
  rest of the courtiers and visitors remembering they have a Queen!"
 "I hear Scraps and the Scarecrow," squealed Pigasus, "I hear Bettsy Bobb and
  Trot. Quick, Dorothy, open the door."
 "No, no, not yet," said Ozma gently but firmly. "There is more, much more
  for us to hear and settle. But you go out, Pigasus, and tell them all about
  our enchantment, Skamperoo's reign, and our rescue."
 "Be glad to! Charmed! And trust me to do it right." Swelling up with
  importance and pride, Pigasus flew out the window before Dorothy had time
  to open the door. A few moments later the company in the Wizard's
  laboratory heard him calling everyone to follow him to the Throne Room and

  hear the most startling news since Dorothy killed the Wicked Witches of the
  East and West.
 "And how he'll love telling it," said Bitty Bit, smiling across at the
  Wizard of Ev. "A great idea of yours, this pig, Jinny. Even if his verses
  are low, I like him."
 "Oh, everyone likes Pigasus," declared Dorothy, coming over to sit on the
  arm of Glinda's chair. "But what I'd like to know is how that Kitchen Boy
  happened to have the emeralds, how Skamperoo got them, and where they came
  from in the first place."
 "Yes," murmured Glinda, who, like the Wizard, felt very much annoyed to have
  been overpowered by a fat, unimportant monarch like Skamperoo. "Now that we
  have these wishing chains, we must guard them carefully to keep them from
  falling into such mischievous hands again."
 "I believe Bitty Bit can tell us the story of the emeralds," said Ozma, who
  had been much impressed by the cheerful little seer of Some Summit. "With
  his gift of foreseeing and foretelling he probably knows the whole story."
 "Can he look backward as well as forward?" inquired the Wizard
  challengingly.
 "Just as well," confessed Bitty Bit with an embarrassed little cough, and as
  every head turned expectantly toward him, the sage closed his eyes and
  quietly told them the interesting story of Matiah's three necklaces.
 "These magic emeralds," began Bitty Bit, waving his hands rhythmically
  backward and forward, "were first collected and strung into necklaces by a
  wizard named Wam for the King of the Green Mountain as a gift for the wood
  nymph Lorna. But the King of the Green Mountain was an ugly little dwarf,

  and though she had promised to marry him, no sooner did Lorna have the
  necklaces than she turned the King into a frog and hid herself away in her
  own forest.
 "In the giant hollow tree where Lorna lived there was a mischievous family
  of squirrels. That night as Lorna lay sleeping with the emeralds on a
  little golden plate beside her, one of the squirrels, thinking the gems
  some new and delicious kind of nuts, stole and buried them away for the
  winter. Next morning, though Lorna ran crying and searching all through the
  forest, she was unable to find her wishing necklaces."
 "Then what became of them?" gasped Dorothy as Bitty Bit, opening his eyes
  for a moment, blinked cheerfully over their heads.
 "Wait, I'll tell you!" Closing his eyes, the sage went hurriedly on with the
  story. "Ah, so this is it! A woodcutter's boy, poking about among the
  leaves, found the emeralds, and as emeralds in themselves are not uncommon
  in Oz, he traded them to a peddler for a new ax. The peddler, arriving
  after a long while in Skampavia, had no trouble in disposing of the jewels.
  In Skampavia, you must know, emeralds, pearls, or jewels of any kind are
  practically unknown, and a merchant gave the peddler not only his house and
  shop, but all of his merchandise for the three sparkling chains.
 "By a law in Skampavia, every subject must render to the King one-third of
  all he owns or raises, and in due course one of the necklaces was sent to
  Skamperoo. The King, delighted with the sparkling gems, insisted on having
  all three necklaces, and Matiah himself brought them to the castle,
  determined if possible to steal them back at the first opportunity. In
  order to do so without arousing the suspicions of the King, he pretends to
  be a Wizard and tells him if he, Matiah, wears the three necklaces, he can

  grant any wish the King may make, but that as he makes the wish he must
  close his eyes and count to a hundred.
 "As soon as Skamperoo began to count, Matiah started to run off with the
  emeralds, and that accounts for the white horse, for you see, Skamperoo's
  first wish was for a splendid white charger with a golden mane and tail.
  Frightened almost out of his senses by the sudden appearance of the horse
  and the knowledge that the chains really did have some magic power, Matiah
  steals back beside the King, resolved to wait for another opportunity to
  procure the necklaces.
 "Meanwhile, Skamperoo, excited and happy over the granting of his first
  wish, confides in the merchant his second wish and ambition to be ruler of
  Oz. Matiah, to gain time in which he can work out the secret of the
  emeralds' power, approves of the King's idea, but tells him he can only
  grant one wish a week. He then advises Skamperoo to cause all the people in
  Oz to forget their former rulers and to remove the Wizard and all his
  magic, Ozma, and the rulers of the four Oz countries to the inaccessible
  caverns of Thunder Mountain.
 "Now while Matiah is trying his best to discover the trick of the magic
  emeralds, Skamperoo, growing tired of the tempery fellow, appealed to his
  horse. The horse, being magically brought to life and being unusually
  sharp-witted and quick, soon worked out the problem. With his help
  Skamperoo wished the spell of forgetting upon Ozma's subjects, banished her
  Highness and all of the others just as Matiah had suggested, and managed to
  rule Oz for three whole days."
 "But what became of Matiah?" asked Glinda, leaning forward eagerly.

 "At this moment Matiah is lying in a senseless condition in the underground
  chamber beneath this castle," Bitty Bit told them solemnly and without
  opening his eyes. "Soon after Skamperoo left for Oz, the merchant was
  driven out of Skampavia by Pinny Penny, whom Skamperoo had made King.
  Matiah, furious to think the apparently stupid sovereign had outwitted him,
  bribed an eagle to carry him across the desert, arrived at the Emerald City
  and soon afterward managed to really steal the necklaces from Skamperoo.
  Discovering beneath the cellar the excavated chambers of the old Gnome
  King, he retired to this quiet spot to again experiment with the emeralds.
 "Needing another person to help, he seized the Kitchen Boy who had come to
  the cellar for supplies and forced him to assist in his experiments. How
  soon he might have discovered the real trick of the chains I cannot say,
  but our own arrival and Gloma's powder of darkness happily interrupted him.
  The Kitchen Boy, who had kept his eyes glued to the stone steps and
  trapdoor during the entire morning, made an immediate dash for freedom and
  managed to escape in spite of the darkness. Matiah, not so fortunate,
  rushed into a stone pillar and knocked himself senseless. He's still lying
  there, and I suggest that your Majesty deal with him at once."
 "I will," decided Ozma firmly, as Bitty Bit opened his eyes and looked
  cheerfully around the table. "And I'll do it by means of these very magic
  emeralds. Put on the emeralds, Dorothy, for you alone know the secret of
  their magic power." So Dorothy, anxious to have Matiah out of Oz before he
  recovered his wicked wits, hastily clasped the three chains around her slim
  throat.
 "It is my earnest wish that Matiah shall immediately and henceforth forget
  the emerald necklaces of Oz, return to his country, and become a good and

  simple citizen of Skampavia," said Ozma seriously, beginning her count to
  one hundred.
 "He's gone! He's gone!" piped up Bitty Bit, who had closed his eyes as soon
  as Ozma started to speak. "And if I were you, my dear, I would send off
  that red eagle, too. I see him lurking on the edge of our city with an
  exceedingly fierce light in his eye." So Ozma made another wish, turning
  the eagle to a harmless sparrow.
 "And what about Skamperoo?" asked Cheeriobed, King of the Munchkins, who up
  to this time had not spoken a word. "Should he not be punished in some
  way?"
 "I would not bother with old Skamper," advised Bitty Bit with a small
  chuckle. "Before I agreed to give his white horse those five wishes, I
  closed my eyes, looked ahead, and discovered that they would all be good
  wishes. Not only good but wise, and from now on I think you can trust that
  clever white horse and a little fellow called Pinny Penny to keep their
  Master out of mischief and Oz."
 "Well, in that case," sighed Ozma rather breathless from so much counting,
  "everything is happily settled."
 "And in that case," boomed Joe King, gallantly helping his little Queen to
  her feet, "I suggest we start celebrating all over again, not only the
  discovery of Oz by mortals, but the saving of Oz as well! I for one feel
  terribly cheated at missing Notta's circus."
 "So do I! So do I!" exclaimed the little Prince Philador, climbing
  boisterously into Highboy's saddle. "I want to see a circus!"
 "And so you shall," promised Ozma gaily. "We will start the celebration at

  exactly the point where we left Oz for Thunder Mountain, and have the
  tableaux, the pageants, and the picnics all over again."
 And that, my dear, is exactly what they did do, and everyone, including
  Bitty Bit, enjoyed themselves so much there was not an unhappy person in
  the Emerald City. And not until the end of the second day did Dorothy
  remember to tell Ozma the magic secret of the wishing emeralds. "On the
  sixth count, you wink both eyes," whispered Dorothy, giving Ozma a little
  hug. "Good night!"
 "Good gracious, so THAT'S it!" smiled Ozma, comprehending instantly what
  Dorothy meant. "I suppose Matiah did it in sheer excitement the first time.
  Well, I have often heard of doing things in the twinkling of an eye, but
  now we shall really be able to have them that way. No one knows this secret
  but you and me and a white horse, and no one must ever know it, for
  wishes are dangerous and cause more unhappiness than joy, so we'll never
  tell another soul, will we, Dorothy?"
 "Never!" agreed the little girl, looking solemnly over her shoulder at the
  safe where Ozma had hidden her new treasure.
  
 CHAPTER 20
 BACK IN SKAMPAVIA!
 "So there you are!" Pinny Penny straightened up with a little grimace, for
  he had been planting flowers in a new rock garden he was planning for the
  King. With an expression about equally compounded of exasperation and
  affection, he looked at his former Master and the white horse who had,
  without sound or warning, dropped down in the path before him. "I thought
  you'd come back," continued Pinny Penny, calmly rubbing the mud from his

  fingers and putting out his hand. "So it was your horse after all." His
  gaze rested speculatively on the splendid white steed and richly jeweled
  robes of Skamperoo. "And you've made your fortune, I see! Well, welcome
  home anyway; your crown's hanging on a nail back of the throne, and I think
  you will find everything in order."
 "In order! Why, it looks wonderful!" shouted Skamperoo, leaping exuberantly
  out of the saddle and honestly surprised and pleased at the pleasure he
  felt in seeing old Pinny Penny again. "You've had the palace painted, and
  this garden and that fountain and the flowers. They're all new, aren't
  they?"
 "Yes," agreed Pinny Penny guardedly. "I made a few new laws while you were
  gone, Skamper, making the tax only one-twentieth of our subjects' earnings.
  They were so grateful and delighted, they've been sending you presents ever
  since. Then the guards (having no drill or marching to bother them, I did
  away with THAT, too), the guards in their odd time agreed to work around
  the castle, and we've been brightening up the old place quite a bit. I tell
  you," Pinny Penny exhaled his breath noisily, "we'll make a going and
  coming country of this yet!"
 "Of course we will," said Skamperoo, bouncing happily along at his side.
  "I've had a lot of experience since I saw you, old Skinny Pins. Ho, Pinny,
  my boy, I've been an Emperor in Oz!"
 "OZ? Never!" Closing his lips into a thin line, Pinny Penny looked from his
  Master to Chalk, who was stepping sedately along on his other side.
 "But it's perfectly true," whinnied the white horse, prancing a bit from
  sheer enjoyment, "and now we are home with five splendid wishes."

 "Wishes?" sniffed Pinny Penny, rearing his head suspiciously. "What good are
  wishes?"
 "But these wishes really work and come true," explained Chalk with a toss of
  his head, "and what's more, they are going to work and come true for
  Skampavia!"
 "Any wish you work hard enough for will come true," insisted Pinny Penny
  stubbornly. "Wishes POOH! Wishes POOH! `If wishes were horses,
  beggars would ride!'" finished the little Prime Minister half under
  his breath.
 "But don't you see?" Skamperoo grasped Pinny Penny firmly by the shoulders.
  "This is one time when wishes WERE horses and beggars DID ride. My first
  wish was for a horse, and here he is, and as true as you are and as wise
  and clever. Why, even if the magic emeralds give me nothing more, I am
  still the luckiest fellow on this side of the Deadly Desert!"
 "Moons, stars and rainbows! I believe you have gotten some sense," gasped
  Pinny Penny, staring with wide eyes into Skamperoo's face. "And that's the
  first good I ever knew to come of magic."
 Pulling Pinny Penny down to his old bench, now neatly mended and painted
  green, the King of Skampavia told his little Prime Minister the whole story
  I have just been telling you. When he finished and settled back
  complacently, Pinny Penny, instead of looking glad or pleased, stared
  mournfully at the ground.
 "Now what's the matter?" demanded Skamperoo, clapping him impatiently on
  the back while Chalk, breaking off a little branch with his teeth, tickled
  Pinny Penny mischievously under the chin. "Why are you so sad and solemn?"
 "Because " Pinny Penny ground the toe of his boot deeply into the gravel

  in the path "if you really have five more magic wishes, you'll
  probably be going to some grand other place and be spending the rest of
  your life in travel."
 "If that were so, we wouldn't be here at all," puffed Skamperoo. "Now get
  this through your head, old fellow. We are here by our own wish and from
  now on my country is good enough for me and, when we've made these five
  good wishes, good enough for anybody!"
 "There you go! There you go!" groaned Pinny Penny, covering his face with
  his hands. "It's the wishes I'm afraid of."
 "Well, you needn't be!" With a great effort, Skamperoo made his first really
  great and wise decision. "You shall make the wishes yourself, Pinny Penny,
  and I shall save only one in case of trouble!"
 "Bravo! Bravo!" snorted Chalk, prancing three times round the green bench.
 "Me? You really mean me?" quavered Pinny Penny, pointing an unbelieving
  finger at his own midsection. Then, as Skamperoo nodded and before he could
  change his mind, the old Chancellor fairly leaped into the air. "I wish the
  King of this country to always be as wise and generous as he has succeeded
  in being at this moment, as wise as the young Fairy Ruler of Oz," panted
  Pinny Penny. "I wish that the people of Skampavia, using the powers and
  abilities they already have, shall make this a rich, happy and prosperous
  Kingdom. I wish that the climate and soil, the only bad features about
  which we might complain, shall become mild and fertile! That's all, that's
  all I can think of!" confessed Pinny Penny, shrinking happily back on the
  bench.
 "Then I'll make a wish," whinnied Chalk, shaking his beautiful golden mane.

  "I wish that we three may never be separated. Long live the KING AND HIS
  PRIME MINISTER!"
 "And his horse!" cried Skamperoo, bounding up to seize Chalk's bridle.
 "And his horse!" echoed Pinny Penny heartily, running round to seize Chalk's
  bridle on the other side. "We three for Skampavia forever!"
 Then, with Chalk stepping proudly in the center, these three strangely
  assorted comrades made their way into the palace. Knowing the power of the
  magic emeralds and also the magic power of knowledge and experience, I am
  sure that Skampavia under its new regime will soon be as happy and
  prosperous as any Nation in Oz!
