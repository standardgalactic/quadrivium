About the Authors
Peter Mikulecky grew up in Milwaukee, an area of Wisconsin unique for its high human-
to-cow ratio. After a breezy four-year tour in the Army, Peter earned a bachelor of science
degree in biochemistry and molecular biology from the University of Wisconsin–
Eau Claire and a PhD in biological chemistry from Indiana University. With science
seething in his DNA, he sought to infect others with a sense of molecular wonderment.
Having taught, tutored, and mentored in classroom and laboratory environments, Peter
was happy to find a home at Fusion Learning Center and Fusion Academy. There, he
enjoys convincing students that biology and chemistry are, in fact, fascinating journeys,
not entirely designed to inflict pain on hapless teenagers. His military training occasion-
ally aids him in this effort.
Katherine (Kate) Brutlag has been a full-fledged science dork since she picked up her
first book on dinosaurs as a child. A native of Minnesota, Kate enjoys typical regional
activities such as snow sports and cheese eating. Kate left Minnesota as a teen to study
at Middlebury College in Vermont and graduated with a double major in physics and
Japanese. Seeking to unite these two highly unrelated passions, she spent a year in
Kyoto, Japan, on a Fulbright scholarship researching Japanese constellation lore. Kate
was quickly drawn back to the pure sciences, however, and she discovered her love for
education through her work at Fusion Academy, where she currently teaches upper-level
sciences and Japanese.
Michelle Rose Gilman is most proud to be known as Noah’s mom. A graduate of the
University of South Florida, Michelle found her niche early, and at 19, she was working
with emotionally disturbed and learning-disabled students in hospital settings. At 21, 
she made the trek to California, where she found her passion for helping teenagers
become more successful in school and life. What started as a small tutoring business in
the garage of her California home quickly expanded and grew to the point where traffic
control was necessary on her residential street.
Today, Michelle is the founder and CEO of Fusion Learning Center and Fusion Academy, 
a private school and tutoring/test prep facility in Solana Beach, California, serving more
than 2,000 students per year. She is the author of ACT For Dummies, Pre-Calculus For
Dummies, AP Biology For Dummies, AP Chemistry For Dummies, GRE For Dummies, and
other books on self-esteem, writing, and motivational topics. Michelle has overseen
dozens of programs over the last 20 years, focusing on helping kids become healthy
adults. She currently specializes in motivating the unmotivated adolescent, comforting
their shell-shocked parents, and assisting her staff of 35 teachers.
Michelle lives by the following motto: There are people content with longing; I am not
one of them.
Brian Peterson remembers a love for science going back to his own AP Biology class. 
At the University of San Diego, Brian majored in biology and minored in chemistry, with 
a pre-med emphasis. Before embarking to medical school, Brian took a young adult–
professional detour and found himself at Fusion Learning Center and Fusion Academy,
where he quickly discovered a love of teaching. Years later, he finds himself the science
department head at Fusion and oversees a staff of 11 science teachers. Brian, also known
as “Beeps” by his favorite students, encourages the love of science in his students by
offering unique and innovative science curricula.

Chemistry Workbook For Dummies 

Introduction
“T
he first essential in chemistry is that you should perform practical work and conduct
experiments, for he who performs not practical work nor makes experiments will never
attain the least degree of mastery.”
—J≈bir ibn Hayy≈n, 8th century
“One of the wonders of this world is that objects so small can have such consequences: Any 
visible lump of matter — even the merest speck — contains more atoms than there are stars 
in our galaxy.”
—Peter W. Atkins, 20th century
Chemistry is at once practical and wondrous, humble and majestic. And, for someone study-
ing it for the first time, chemistry can be tricky.
That’s why we wrote this book. Chemistry is wondrous. Workbooks are practical. This is a
chemistry workbook.
About This Book
When you’re fixed in the thickets of stoichiometry or bogged down by buffered solutions,
you’ve got little use for rapturous poetry about the atomic splendor of the universe. What
you need is a little practical assistance. Subject by subject, problem by problem, this book
extends a helping hand to pull you out of the thickets and bogs.
The topics covered in this book are those most often covered in a first course of chemistry.
The focus is on problems — problems like those you may encounter in homework or on
exams. We give you just enough theory to grasp the principles at work in the problems. Then
we tackle example problems. Then you tackle practice problems.
This workbook is modular. You can pick and choose those chapters and types of problems
that challenge you the most; you don’t have to read this book cover to cover if you don’t
want to. If certain topics require you to know other topics in advance, we tell you so and
point you in the right direction. Most importantly, worked-out solutions and explanations are
provided for every problem.
Conventions Used in This Book
We provide the following conventions to guide you through this book:
 Italics highlight definitions, emphasize certain words, and point out variables in formulas.
 Boldfaced text points out key words in bulleted lists and actions to take in numbered lists.

Foolish Assumptions
We assume you have a basic facility with algebra and arithmetic. You should know how 
to solve simple equations for an unknown variable. You should know how to work with 
exponents and logarithms. That’s about it for the math. At no point do we ask you to, say,
consider the contradictions between the Schrödinger equation and stochastic wavefunction
collapse.
We assume you’re a high school or college student and have access to a secondary school-
level (or higher) textbook in chemistry or some other basic primer, such as Chemistry For
Dummies (written by John T. Moore, EdD, and published by Wiley). We present enough
theory in this workbook for you to tackle the problems, but you’ll benefit from a broader
description of basic chemical concepts. That way, you’ll more clearly understand how the
various pieces of chemistry operate within a larger whole — you’ll see the compound for the
elements, so to speak.
We assume you don’t like to waste time. Neither do we. Chemists in general aren’t too fond of
time-wasting, so if you’re impatient for progress, you’re already part-chemist at heart.
How This Book Is Organized
This workbook is divided into thematic parts. By no means is it absolutely necessary to con-
sume all the chapters of a part in sequence, nor is it necessary to progress in a straight line
from one part to the next. But it may be useful to do so, especially if you’re starting from a
place of Total Chemical Bewilderment (T.C.B.).
Part I: Getting Cozy with Numbers, 
Atoms, and Elements
Chemists are part of a larger scientific enterprise, so they handle numbers with care and
according to certain rules. The reasons for this meticulousness become clear as you con-
sider the kinds of measurements chemists routinely make on very large numbers of particles.
The most familiar of these kinds of chemical particles are atoms. This part covers some
must-know material about numbers in chemistry, describes the basic structure of atoms, 
outlines how atoms belong to one or another variety of element, and explains how atoms
interact within different states of matter.
Part II: Making and Remaking Compounds
Reactions are the dramatic deeds of chemistry. By reacting, atoms assemble into compounds,
and compounds transform into other compounds. This part gives you the basic tools to
describe the drama. We explain the basics of bonding and the system for naming compounds.
We introduce you to the mole, to chemical equations, and to stoichiometry, simple concepts
you’ll use for the remainder of your chemical career — however long or brief.

Part III: Examining Changes 
in Terms of Energy
Chemistry is change. Change either happens or it doesn’t. When it happens, change can
occur rapidly or slowly. Busy and industrious as they are, chemists want to know whether
their chemistry will happen and for how long. This part describes the kinds of changes that
can occur in chemical systems and the kinds of systems — like, say, solutions — in which
those changes occur. We cover the difference between equilibrium (will it happen?) and rate
(how long will it take to happen?), and relate the two to differences in energy between states.
Because chemistry transforms energy as well as matter, we explore some important ways
chemists describe the changes in energy that drive chemical reactions.
Part IV: Swapping Charges
Charge is a big deal in chemistry. Charged particles are marquee players on the chemical
playing field, and this part examines their playbook in greater detail. Acid-base reactions 
are vital chemical events that include the actions of charged particles such as hydrogen 
and hydroxide ions (H+ and OH- . . . you’ll see). Oxidation-reduction (or “redox”) reactions 
are another critical class of reactions that include transfers of electrons, the tiny, negatively
charged particles that get most of the chemical action. Finally, we summarize nuclear chem-
istry, the special branch of chemistry that includes transformations of particles within the
nucleus, the positively charged heart of an atom.
Part V: Going Organic
Because most practicing chemists are alive, it should come as no surprise that many of them
are interested in the chemistry of life. The chemistry performed by living things is largely
organic chemistry, or the chemistry of multicarbon compounds. Although organic chemistry
is a central feature of living organisms, it’s not limited to them. The energy and materials
industries, for example, are chock-full of organic chemists. This part provides a concise
overview of organic chemistry basics, highlighting simple structures and structural motifs,
and surveying some important classes of organic molecules in biology.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
It’s easy to get lost within a science that covers everything from subatomic particles to cellu-
lar phone batteries to atomic spectra from distant stars. When you grow dizzy with T.C.B.,
plant your feet on solid ground in the Part of Tens. This part is reassuringly succinct and
practical, filled with the equations you need and helpful reminders about tricky details. Time
spent in the Part of Tens is never wasted.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
You’ll find a selection of helpful icons nicely nestled along the margins of this workbook.
Think of them as landmarks, familiar signposts to guide you as you cruise the highways of
chemistry.
Within already pithy summaries of chemical concepts, passages marked by this icon represent
the pithiest, must-know bits of information. You’ll need to know this stuff to solve problems.
Sometimes there’s an easy way and a hard way. This icon alerts you to passages intended to
highlight an easier way. It’s worth your while to linger for a moment. You may find yourself
nodding quietly as you jot down a grateful note or two.
Chemistry may be a practical science, but it also has its pitfalls. This icon raises a red flag to
direct your attention to easily made errors or other tricky items. Pay attention to this mate-
rial to save yourself from needless frustration.
Within each section of a chapter, this icon announces “Here ends theory” and “Let the prac-
tice begin.” Alongside the icon is an example problem that employs the very concept cov-
ered in that section. An answer and explanation accompany each practice problem.
Where to Go from Here
Where you go from here depends on your situation, your learning style, and your overall
state of T.C.B.:
 If you’re currently enrolled in a chemistry course, you may want to scan the Table of
Contents to determine what material you’ve already covered in class. Do you recall any
concepts that confused you? Try a few practice problems from these sections to assess
your readiness for more advanced material.
 If you’re brushing up on forgotten chemistry, it may be helpful to scan the chapters 
for example problems. As you read through them, you’ll probably have one of two
responses: 1) “Aaah, yes . . . I remember that.” 2) “Oooh, no . . . I so do not remember
that.” Let your responses guide you.
 If you’re just beginning a chemistry course, you can follow along in this workbook,
using the practice problems to supplement your homework or as extra pre-exam prac-
tice. Alternately, you can use this workbook to preview material before you cover it in
class, sort of like a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down.
Whatever your situation, be sure to make smart use of the practice problems, because they
are the heart of the workbook. Work each practice problem completely — even if you sus-
pect you’re off-track — before you check your answer. If your answer was incorrect, be sure
you reason through the provided answer and explanation so you understand why your
answer was wrong. Then attempt the next problem.

Also, remember that the Cheat Sheet (the yellow tear-out card at the front of this book) and
the Part of Tens are your friends. Most of the nitty-gritty stuff you need to work the more dif-
ficult problems is found in there.
Finally, rest assured that chemistry isn’t alchemy. Mysterious as it may sometimes seem,
chemistry is a practical, understandable pursuit. Chemistry is neither above you nor beyond
you. It awaits your mastery.

hemistry is a science. This means that like any other kind of scientist, a chemist tests
hypotheses by doing experiments. Better tests require more reliable measurements,
and better measurements are those that have more accuracy and precision. This explains
why chemists get so giggly and twitchy about high-tech instruments; those instruments
make better measurements. How do chemists report their precious measurements? What’s
the difference between accuracy and precision in those measurements? How do chemists
do math with measurements? These questions may not keep you awake at night, but know-
ing the answers to them will keep you from making embarrassing, rookie errors in chem-
istry. So we address them in this chapter.
Using Exponential and Scientific Notation 
to Report Measurements
Because chemistry concerns itself with ridiculously tiny things like atoms and molecules,
chemists often find themselves dealing with extraordinarily small or extraordinarily large
numbers. Numbers describing the distance between two atoms joined by a bond, for exam-
ple, run in the ten-billionths of a meter. Numbers describing how many water molecules 
populate a drop of water run into the trillions of trillions.
To make working with such extreme numbers easier, chemists turn to scientific notation,
which is a special kind of exponential notation. Exponential notation simply means writing 
a number in a way that includes exponents. Every number is written as the product of two
numbers, a coefficient and a power of 10. In plain old exponential notation, a coefficient can
be any value of a number multiplied by a power with a base of 10 (such as 104). But scientists
have rules for coefficients in scientific notation. In scientific notation, a coefficient is always
at least 1 and always less than 10 (such as 7, 3.48, or 6.0001).
To convert a very large or very small number to scientific notation, position a decimal point
between the first and second digits. Count how many places you moved the decimal to the
right or left, and that’s the power of 10. If you moved the decimal to the left, the power is 
positive; to the right is negative. (You use the same process for exponential notation, but 
you can position the decimal anywhere.)

In scientific notation, the coefficients should be greater than 1 and less than 10, so look for
the first digit other than 0.
To convert a number written in scientific notation back into decimal form, just multiply the
coefficient by the accompanying power of 10.

Convert 47,000 to scientific notation.
A.
47,000 = 4.7 × 104. First, imagine the
number as a decimal:
47,000.00
Next, move the decimal between the first
two digits:
4.7000
Then count how many positions to the
left you moved the decimal (four, in this
case), and write that as a power of 10: 
4.7 × 104.
Q.
Convert 0.007345 to scientific notation.
A.
0.007345 = 7.345 × 10–3. First, move the
decimal between the first two nonzero
digits:
7.345
Then count how many positions to the
right you moved the decimal (three, in
this case), and write that as a power of
10: 0.007345 = 7.345 × 10–3.

Multiplying and Dividing in Scientific Notation
A major benefit of presenting numbers in scientific notation is that it simplifies common arith-
metic operations. (Another benefit is that, among the pocket-protector set, numbers with
exponents just look way cooler.) The simplifying powers of scientific notation are most evi-
dent in multiplication and division. (As we describe in the next section, addition and subtrac-
tion benefit from exponential notation, but not necessarily from strict scientific notation.)
To multiply two numbers written in scientific notation, multiply the coefficients, and then
add the exponents. To divide two numbers, simply divide the coefficients, and then subtract
the exponent of the denominator (the bottom number) from the exponent of the numerator
(the top number).
11
Chapter 1: Noting Numbers Scientifically
Q.
Multiply, using the “shortcuts” of scien-
tific notation: (1.4 × 102) × (2.0 × 10–5).
A.
2.8 × 10–3. First, multiply the coefficients:
1.4 × 2.0 = 2.8
Next, add the exponents of the powers 
of 10:
102 × 10–5 = 102 + (–5) = 10–3
Finally, join your new coefficient to your
new power of 10:
2.8 × 10–3
Q.
Divide, using the “shortcuts” of scientific
notation: (3.6 × 10–3) / (1.8 × 104).
A.
2.0 × 10–7. First, divide the coefficients:
3.6 / 1.8 = 2.0
Next, subtract the exponent of the
denominator from the exponent of the
numerator:
10–3 / 104 = 10–3 – 4 = 10–7
Then, join your new coefficient to your
new power of 10:
2.0 × 10–7
5.
Multiply (2.2 × 109) × (5.0 × 10–4).

6.
Divide (9.3 × 10–5) / (3.1 × 102).

Using Exponential Notation to Add and Subtract
Addition or subtraction gets easier when your numbers are expressed as coefficients of iden-
tical powers of 10. To wrestle your numbers into this form, you might need to use coeffi-
cients less than 1 or greater than 10. So, scientific notation is a bit too strict for addition and
subtraction, but exponential notation still serves us well.
To add two numbers easily by using exponential notation, first express each number as a
coefficient and a power of 10, making sure that 10 is raised to the same exponent in each
number. Then add the coefficients. To subtract numbers in exponential notation, follow the
same steps, but subtract the coefficients.

A.
39.5 × 102. First, convert both numbers
to the same power of 10:
37.1 × 102 and 2.4 × 102
Next, add the coefficients:
37.1 + 2.4 = 39.5
Finally, join your new coefficient to the
shared power of 10:

7.43 × 10–2 and 0.22 × 10–2
Next, subtract the coefficients:
7.43 – 0.22 = 7.21

Distinguishing between Accuracy and Precision
Accuracy and precision . . . precision and accuracy . . . same thing, right? Chemists every-
where gasp in horror, reflexively clutching their pocket protectors — accuracy and precision
are different!
 Accuracy describes how closely a measurement approaches an actual, true value.
 Precision, which we discuss more in the next section, describes how close repeated
measurements are to one another, regardless of how close those measurements are to
the actual value. The bigger the difference between the largest and smallest values of a
repeated measurement, the less precision you have.
The two most common measurements related to accuracy are error and percent error.
 Error measures accuracy, the difference between a measured value and the actual
value:
Actual value – Measured value = Error
 Percent error compares error to the size of the thing being measured:
|Error| / Actual value = Fraction error
Fraction error × 100 = Percent error
Being off by 1 meter isn’t such a big deal when measuring the altitude of a mountain, but it’s
a shameful amount of error when measuring the height of an individual mountain climber.
14
Part I: Getting Cozy with Numbers, Atoms, and Elements 
Q.
A police officer uses a radar gun to clock
a passing Ferrari at 131 miles per hour
(mph). The Ferrari was really speeding 
at 127 mph. Calculate the error in the
officer’s measurement.
A.
–4 mph. First, determine which value is
the actual value and which is the meas-
ured value:
Actual value = 127 mph; measured value
= 131 mph
Then calculate the error by subtracting
the measured value from the actual
value:
Error = 127 mph – 131 mph = –4 mph
Q.
Calculate the percent error in the offi-
cer’s measurement of the Ferrari’s speed.
A.
3.15%. First, divide the absolute value
(the size, as a positive number) of the
error by the actual value:
|–4 mph| / 127 mph = 4 mph / 127 mph =
0.0315
Next, multiply the result by 100 to obtain
the percent error:
Percent error = 0.0315 × 100 = 3.15%

Expressing Precision with Significant Figures
After you know how to express your numbers in scientific notation and how to distinguish
precision from accuracy (we cover both topics earlier in this chapter), you can bask in the
glory of a new skill: using scientific notation to express precision. The beauty of this system
is that simply by looking at a measurement, you know just how precise that measurement is.
When you report a measurement, you should only include digits if you’re really confident
about their values. Including added digits in a measurement means something — it means
that you really know what you’re talking about — so we call the included digits significant 
figures. The more significant figures in a measurement, the more precise that measurement
must be. The last significant figure in a measurement is the only figure that includes any
uncertainty. Here are the rules for deciding what is and what isn’t a significant figure:
 Any nonzero digit is significant. So, 6.42 seconds (s) contains three significant figures.
 Zeros sandwiched between nonzero digits are significant. So, 3.07s contains three
significant figures.
 Zeros on the left side of the first nonzero digit are not significant. So, 0.0642s and
0.00307s each contain three significant figures.
 When a number is greater than 1, all digits to the right of the decimal point are
understood to be significant. So, 1.76s has three significant figures, while 1.760s has
four significant figures. The “6” is uncertain in the first measurement, but is certain in
the second measurement.

Chapter 1: Noting Numbers Scientifically
13. Two people, Reginald and Dagmar, measure
their weight in the morning by using typi-
cal bathroom scales, instruments that are
famously unreliable. The scale reports that
Reginald weighs 237 pounds, though he
actually weighs 256 pounds. Dagmar’s
scale reports her weight as 117 pounds,
though she really weighs 129 pounds.
Whose measurement incurred the greater
error? Whose incurred a greater percent
error?

14. Two jewelers were asked to measure the
mass of a gold nugget. The true mass of the
nugget was 0.856 grams (g). Each jeweler
took three measurements. The average of
the three measurements was reported as
the “official” measurement with the follow-
ing results:
Jeweler A: 0.863g, 0.869g, 0.859g
Jeweler B: 0.875g, 0.834g, 0.858g
Which jeweler’s official measurement was
more accurate? Which jeweler’s measure-
ments were more precise? In each case,
what was the error and percent error in the
official measurement?
Solve It

 When a number has no decimal point, any zeros after the last nonzero digit may or
may not be significant. So, in a measurement reported as 1,370s, you can’t be certain
if the “0” is a certain value, or if it’s merely a placeholder.
Be a good chemist. Report your measurements in scientific notation to avoid such
annoying ambiguities (see the earlier section, “Using Exponential and Scientific
Notation to Report Measurements”).
 Numbers from counting (for example, 1 kangaroo, 2 kangaroos, 3 kangaroos . . .) 
or from defined quantities (that is to say, 60 seconds per 1 minute) are understood
to have an unlimited number of significant figures; in other words, these values are
completely certain.
 If a number is already written in scientific notation, then all the digits in the coeffi-
cient are significant, and none others.
So, the number of significant figures you use in a reported measurement should be consis-
tent with your certainty about that measurement. If you know your speedometer is routinely
off by 5 miles per hour, then you have no business protesting to a policeman that you were
only going 63.2 miles per hour.

How many significant figures are in the
following three measurements?

yards
A.
Five, three, and four significant figures,
respectively. In the first measurement,
all digits are nonzero, except for a 0 that
is sandwiched between nonzero digits,
which counts as significant. The second
measurement contains only nonzero
digits. The third measurement contains a
0, but that 0 is the final digit and to the
right of the decimal point, and is there-
fore significant.

0.2 grams in either direction. What, then,
is wrong with the following reported
measurements?
893.7 ±1 gram, 342 ±0.01 gram
Solve It

Doing Arithmetic with Significant Figures
Doing chemistry means making a lot of measurements. The point of spending a pile of money
on cutting-edge instruments is to make really good, really precise measurements. After
you’ve got yourself some measurements, you roll up your sleeves, hike up your pants, and
do math with the measurements.
When doing that math, you need to follow some rules to make sure that your sums, differ-
ences, products, and quotients honestly reflect the amount of precision present in the origi-
nal measurements. You can be honest (and avoid the skeptical jeers of surly chemists) by
taking things one calculation at a time, following a few simple rules. One rule applies to addi-
tion and subtraction, and another rule applies to multiplication and division.
 When adding or subtracting, round the sum or difference to the same number of
decimal places as the measurement with the fewest decimal places. Rounding like
this is honest, because you acknowledge that your answer can’t be any more precise
than the least precise measurement that went into it.
 When multiplying or dividing, round the product or quotient so that it has the same
number of significant figures as the least precise measurement — the measurement
with the fewest significant figures.
Notice the difference between the two rules. When you add or subtract, you assign signifi-
cant figures in the answer based on the number of decimal places in each original measure-
ment. When you multiply or divide, you assign significant figures in the answer based on the
total number of significant figures in each original measurement.
Caught up in the breathless drama of arithmetic, you may sometimes perform multi-step cal-
culations that include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, all at once. No prob-
lem. Follow the normal order of operations, doing multiplication and division first, followed
by addition and subtraction. At each step, follow the simple rules previously described, and
then move on to the next step.

Q.
Express the following sum with the
proper number of significant figures:
35.7 miles + 634.38 miles + 0.97 miles = ?
A.
671.1 miles. Adding the three values
yields a raw sum of 671.05 miles.
However, the 35.7 miles measurement
extends only to the tenths place; the
answer must therefore be rounded to the
tenths place, from 671.05 to 671.1 miles.
Q.
Express the following product with the
proper number of significant figures:
27 feet × 13.45 feet = ?
A.
3.6 × 102 feet2. Of the two measurements,
one has two significant figures (27 feet)
and the other has four significant figures
(13.45 feet). The answer is therefore lim-
ited to two significant figures. The raw
product, 363.15 feet2, must be rounded.
You could write 360 feet2, but doing 
so implies that the final 0 is significant
and not just a placeholder. For clarity,
express the product in scientific nota-
tion, as 3.6 × 102 feet2.

Answers to Questions on Noting Numbers
Scientifically
The following are the answers to the practice problems presented in this chapter.
a
2 × 105. Move the decimal point immediately after the 2 to create a coefficient between 1 and
10. Because this means moving the decimal point five places to the left, multiply the coefficient
of 2 with the power 105.
b
8.0736 × 104. Move the decimal point immediately after the 8 to create a coefficient between 
1 and 10. This involves moving the decimal point four places to the left, so multiply the coeffi-
cient of 8.0736 with the power 104.
c
2 × 10–5. Move the decimal point immediately after the 2 to create a coefficient between 1 and
10. This means moving the decimal point five spaces to the right, so multiply the coefficient of
2 with the power 10–5.
d
690.3. This question requires you to understand the meaning of scientific notation in order to
reverse the number back into “regular” decimal form. Because 102 equals 100, multiply the 
coefficient 6.903 with 100. This moves the decimal point two spaces to the right.
e
1.1 × 106. The raw calculation yields 11 × 105, which converts to the given answer when
expressed in scientific notation.
f
3.0 × 10–7. The ease of math with scientific notation shines through in this problem. Dividing
the coefficients yields a coefficient quotient of 3.0, while dividing the powers yields a quotient
of 10–7. Marrying the two quotients produces the given answer, already in scientific notation.
g
1.82. First, convert each number to scientific notation: 5.2 × 101 and 3.5 × 10–2. Next, multiply
the coefficients: 5.2 × 3.5 = 18.2. Then add the exponents on the powers of 10: 101 + (–2) = 10–1.
Finally, join the new coefficient with the new power: 18.2 × 10–1. Expressed in scientific notation,
this answer is 1.82 × 100 = 1.82.
h
3.99 × 10–4. First, convert each number to scientific notation: 8.09 × 10–3 and 2.03 × 101. Then
divide the coefficients: 8.09 / 2.03 = 3.99. Next, subtract the exponent on the denominator from
the exponent of the numerator to get the new power of 10: 10–3 – 1 = 10–4. Join the new coefficient
with the new power: 3.99 × 10–4. Finally, express gratitude that the answer is already conve-
niently expressed in scientific notation.
i
545 × 10–6. Because the numbers are each already expressed with identical powers of 10, you
can simply add the coefficients: 398 + 147 = 545. Then join the new coefficient with the original
power of 10.

6.402 × 105. Because the numbers are each expressed with the same power of 10, you can
simply subtract the coefficients: 7.685 – 1.283 = 6.402. Then join the new coefficient with the
original power of 10.
k
40.16 × 10–3 (or an equivalent expression). First, convert the numbers so they each use the
same power of 10: 2.06 × 10–3 and 38.1 × 10–3. Here, we used 10–3, but you can use a different
power, so long as the same power is used for each number. Next, add the coefficients: 2.06 +
38.1 = 40.16. Finally, join the new coefficient with the shared power of 10.
l
89.21 × 102 (or an equivalent expression). First, convert the numbers so each uses the same
power of 10: 93.52 × 102 and 4.31 × 102. Here, we picked 102, but any power is fine so long as the
two numbers have the same power. Then subtract the coefficients: 93.52 – 4.31 = 89.21. Finally,
join the new coefficient with the shared power of 10.

Reginald’s measurement incurred the greater magnitude of error, while Dagmar’s measure-
ment incurred the greater percent error.
Reginald’s scale reported with an error of 256 pounds – 237 pounds = 19 pounds. Dagmar’s
scale reported with an error of 129 pounds – 117 pounds = 12 pounds. Comparing the 
19
Chapter 1: Noting Numbers Scientifically

magnitudes of error, we see that 19 pounds > 12 pounds. However, Reginald’s measurement had
a percent error of 19 pounds / 256 pounds × 100 = 7.4%, while Dagmar’s measurement had a per-
cent error of 12 pounds / 129 pounds × 100 = 9.3%.
n
Jeweler A’s “official” average measurement was 0.864g, while Jeweler B’s official measurement
was 0.856g; thus, Jeweler B’s official measurement is more accurate because it’s closer to
the actual value of 0.856g.
However, Jeweler A’s measurements were more precise because the differences between A’s
measurements were much smaller than the differences between B’s measurements. Despite the
fact that Jeweler B’s average measurement was closer to the actual value, the range of his meas-
urements (that is, the difference between the largest and the smallest measurements) was
0.041g. The range of Jeweler A’s measurements was 0.010g.
This example shows how low precision measurements can yield highly accurate results
through averaging of repeated measurements. In the case of Jeweler A, the error in the official
measurement was 0.864g – 0.856g = 0.008g. The corresponding percent error was 0.008g / 0.856g
× 100 = 0.9%. In the case of Jeweler B, the error in the official measurement was 0.856g – 0.856g
= 0.000g. Accordingly, the percent error was 0%.
o
With the correct number of significant figures and expressed in scientific notation, the measure-
ments should read as follows: 8 × 10–1 meters, 7.7 × 10–4 meters, 7.69 × 102 meters.
p
“893.7 ± 1 gram” is an improperly reported measurement because the reported value, 893.7,
suggests that the measurement is certain to within a few tenths of a gram. The reported error
is known to be greater, at ±1 gram. The measurement should be reported as “894 ±1 gram.”
“342 ±0.01 gram” is improperly reported because the reported value, 342, gives the impres-
sion that the measurement becomes uncertain at the level of grams. The reported error
makes clear that uncertainty creeps into the measurement only at the level of hundredths of a
gram. The measurement should be reported as “342.00 ±0.01 gram.”
q
1.1436 × 102 seconds. The trick here is remembering to convert all measurements to the same
power of 10 before comparing decimal places for significant figures. Doing so reveals that 1.2 ×
10–1 seconds goes to the hundredths of a second, despite the fact that the measurement con-
tains only two significant figures. The raw calculation yields 114.359 seconds, which rounds
properly to the hundredths place (taking significant figures into account) as 114.36 seconds, 
or 1.1436 × 102 seconds in scientific notation.
r
4.147 × 103 inches. Here, you must recall that defined quantities (1 foot is defined as 12 inches)
have unlimited significant figures. So, our calculation is limited only by the number of signifi-
cant figures in the 345.6 feet measurement. When you multiply 345.6 feet by 12 inches per foot,
the feet cancel, leaving units of inches. The raw calculation yields 4,147.2 inches, which rounds
properly to four significant figures as 4,147 inches, or 4.147 × 103 inches in scientific notation.
s
–9 × 10–3 minutes. Here, it helps here to convert all measurements to the same power of 10 so
you can more easily compare decimal places in order to assign the proper number of signifi-
cant figures. Doing so reveals that 3.7 × 10–4 minutes goes to the hundred-thousandths of a
minute, while 0.009 minutes goes to the thousandths of a minute. The raw calculation yields
–0.00863 minutes, which rounds properly to the thousandths place (taking significant figures
into account) as –0.009 minutes, or –9 × 10–3 minutes in scientific notation.
t
2.93 × 101 feet. Following standard order of operations, this problem can be executed in two main
steps, first performing multiplication and division, and then performing addition and subtraction.
Following the rules of significant figure math, the first step yields: 24.4 feet + 5.02 feet – 0.135
feet. Each product or quotient contains the same number of significant figures as the number in
the calculation with the fewest number of significant figures.
The second step yields 29.3 feet, or 2.93 × 101 feet in scientific notation. The final sum goes only
to the tenths place, because the number in the calculation with the fewest decimal places went
only to the tenths place.

ave you ever been asked for your height in centimeters, your weight in kilograms, or
the speed limit in kilometers per hour? These measurements may seem a bit odd to
those folks who are used to feet, pounds, and miles per hour, but the truth is that scientists
sneer at feet, pounds, and miles. Because scientists around the globe constantly communi-
cate numbers to each other, they prefer a highly systematic, standardized system. The
International System of units, abbreviated SI from the French term Système International, is
the unit system of choice in the scientific community.
You find in this chapter that the SI system is a very logical and well organized set of units.
Despite what many of their hairstyles may imply, scientists love logic and order, so that’s
why SI is their system of choice.
As you work with SI units, try to develop a good sense for how big or small the various units
are. Why? That way, as you’re doing problems, you have a sense for whether your answer is
reasonable.
Familiarizing Yourself with Base Units 
and Metric System Prefixes
The first step in mastering the SI system is to figure out the base units. Much like the atom,
the SI base units are building blocks for more complicated units. In later sections of this
chapter, you find out how more complicated units are built from the SI base units. The five SI
base units that you need to do chemistry problems (as well as their familiar, non-SI counter-
parts) are given in Table 2-1.

Chemists routinely measure quantities that run the gamut from very small (the size of an
atom, for example) to extremely large (such as the number of particles in one mole). Nobody
(not even chemists) likes dealing with scientific notation (which we cover in Chapter 1) if
they don’t have to. For these reasons, chemists often use metric system prefixes in lieu of
scientific notation. For example, the size of the nucleus of an atom is roughly 1 nanometer
across, which is a nicer way of saying 1 × 10–9 meters across. The most useful of these pre-
fixes are given in Table 2-2.

Q.
You measure a length to be 0.005m. How
might this be better expressed using a
metric system prefix?
A.
5 mm. 0.005 is 5 × 10–3m, or 5 mm.

Building Derived Units from Base Units
Chemists aren’t satisfied with measuring length, mass, temperature, and time alone. On the
contrary, chemistry often deals in quantities. These kinds of quantities are expressed with
derived units, which are built from combinations of base units.
 Area (for example, catalytic surface): Area = Length × Width and has units of length
squared (meter2, for example).
 Volume (of a reaction vessel, for example): You calculate volume by using the familiar
formula: Volume = Length × Width × Height. Because length, width, and height are all
length units, you end up with length × length × length, or a length cubed (for example,
meter3).
 Density (of an unidentified substance): Density, arguably the most important derived
unit to a chemist, is built by using the basic formula, Density = Mass / Volume.
In the SI system, mass is measured in kilograms. The standard SI units for mass and
length were chosen by the Scientific Powers That Be because many objects that you
encounter in everyday life weigh between 1 and 100 kg and have dimensions on the
order of 1 meter. Chemists, however, are most often concerned with very small masses
and dimensions; in such cases, grams and centimeters are much more convenient.
Therefore, the standard unit of density in chemistry is grams per cubic centimeter
(g/cm3), rather than kilograms per cubic meter.
The cubic centimeter is exactly equal to 1 milliliter, so densities are also often
expressed in grams per milliliter (g/mL).
 Pressure (an example is of gaseous reactants): Pressure units are derived using the for-
mula, Pressure = Force / Area. The SI units for force and area are Newtons (N) and square
meters (m2), so the SI unit of pressure, the Pascal (Pa), can be expressed as N m-2.

substance to be 20 kg/m3. His chemist
colleague, appalled with the excessively

of the measurement to the more familiar

density?
A.
0.002 g/cm3. A kilogram contains 1,000
grams, so 20 kilograms equals 20,000
grams. Well, 100 cm = 1m, therefore 
(100 cm)3 = (1m)3. In other words, there
are 1003 (or 106) cubic centimeters in 
1 cubic meter. Doing the division gives

Converting between Units: The Conversion Factor
So what happens when chemist Reginald Q. Geekmajor neglects his SI units and measures
the boiling point of his sample to be 101 degrees Fahrenheit, or the volume of his beaker to
be 2 cups? Although Dr. Geekmajor should surely have known better, he can still save himself
the embarrassment of reporting such dirty, unscientific numbers to his colleagues: He can
use conversion factors.
A conversion factor simply uses your knowledge of the relationships between units to con-
vert from one unit to another. For example, if you know that there are 2.54 centimeters in
every inch (or 2.2 pounds in every kilogram, or 101.3 kilopascals in every atmosphere), then
converting between those units becomes simple algebra. Peruse Table 2-3 for some useful
conversion factors. And remember: If you know the relationship between any two units, you
can build your own conversion factor to move between those units.

Chapter 2: Using and Converting Units

As with many things in life, chemistry isn’t always as easy as it seems. Chemistry teachers
are sneaky: They often give you quantities in non-SI units and expect you to use one or more
conversion factors to change them to SI units — all this before you even attempt the “hard
part” of the problem! We are at least marginally less sneaky than your typical chemistry
teacher, but we hope to prepare you for such deception. So, expect to use this section
throughout the rest of this book!
The following example shows how to use a basic conversion factor to “fix” non-SI units.
26
Part I: Getting Cozy with Numbers, Atoms, and Elements 
Q.
Dr. Geekmajor absent-mindedly measures
the mass of a sample to be 0.75 pounds
and records his measurement in his lab
notebook. His astute lab assistant wants
to save the doctor some embarrassment,
and knows that there are 2.2 pounds in
every kilogram; the assistant quickly
converts the doctor’s measurement to SI
units. What does she get?
A:
0.35 kg.
Notice that something very convenient
just happened. Because of the way this
calculation was set up, you end up with
pounds on both the top and bottom of
the fraction. In algebra, whenever you
find the same quantity in a numerator
and in a denominator, you can cancel
them out. Canceling out the pounds is a
lovely bit of algebra, because you didn’t
want them around anyway. The whole
point of the conversion factor is to get
rid of an undesirable unit, transforming it
into a desirable one — without breaking
any rules. You had two choices of con-
version factors to convert between
pounds and kilograms; one with pounds
on the top, and another with pounds on
the bottom. The one to choose was the
one with pounds on the bottom, so the
undesirable pounds units cancel. Had
you chosen the other conversion factor
you would’ve ended up with
0.75 lbs
1
1 kg
0.75 lbs
0.35 kg
×
=
This calculation doesn’t simplify your life
at all, so it’s clearly the wrong choice. If
you end up with more complicated units
after employing a conversion factor, then
try the calculation again, this time flip-
ping the conversion factor.
If you’re a chemistry student, you’re
probably pretty familiar with the basic
rules of algebra (nod your head in
emphatic agreement . . . good). So, you
know that you can’t simply multiply one
number by another and pretend that
nothing happened — you altered the
original quantity when you multiplied,
didn’t you? What in blazes is going on
here? With all these conversion factors
being multiplied willy-nilly, why aren’t
the International Algebra Police kicking
down doors to chemistry labs all around
the world?
Though a few would like you to believe
otherwise, chemists can’t perform magic.
Recall another algebra rule: You can mul-
tiply any quantity by 1 and you’ll always
get back the original quantity. Now, look
closely at the conversion factors in the
example: 2.2 pounds and 1 kilogram are
exactly the same thing! Multiplying by 
2.2 lbs / 1 kg or 1 kg / 2.2 lbs is really no
different than multiplying by 1.

Q.
A chemistry student, daydreaming
during lab, suddenly looks down to find
that he’s measured the volume of his
sample to be 1.5 cubic inches. What does
he get when he converts this quantity to
cubic centimeters?
A.
24.6 cm3.
You’ve already converted between
inches and centimeters, but not between
cubic inches and cubic centimeters.
Rookie chemists often mistakenly
assume that if there are 2.54 centimeters
in every inch, then there are 2.54 cubic

centimeters in every cubic inch. No!
Although this assumption seems logical
at first glance, it leads to catastrophically
wrong answers. Remember that cubic
units are units of volume, and that the
formula for volume is length × width ×
height. Imagine 1 cubic inch as a cube
with 1-inch sides. The cube’s volume is 
1 in × 1 in × 1 in = 1 in3.
Now consider the dimensions of the cube
in centimeters: 2.54 cm x 2.54 cm x 2.54
cm. Calculate the volume using these
measurements and you get 2.54 cm × 2.54
cm × 2.54 cm = 16.39 cm3. This volume is
much greater than 2.54 cm3! Square or
cube everything in your conversion
factor, not just the units, and everything
works out just fine.

Letting the Units Guide You
In the earlier sections in this chapter, the problems have used just one conversion factor at 
a time. You may have noticed that Table 2-3 doesn’t list all possible conversions (between
meters and inches, for example). Rather than bother with memorizing or looking up conver-
sion factors between every type of unit, you can memorize just a handful and use them one
after another, letting the units guide you each step of the way.
Say you wanted to know the number of seconds in one year (clearly a very large number, 
so don’t forget about your scientific notation). Very few people have this conversion 
memorized — or will admit to it — but everyone knows that there are 60 seconds in a
minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, and 365 days in a year. So, use what you
know to get what you want!
You can use as many conversion factors as you need as long as you keep track of your units
in each step. The easiest way to do this is to cancel as you go, and use the remaining unit as
a guide for the next conversion factor. For example, examine the first two factors of the
years-to-seconds conversion. The years on the top and bottom cancel, leaving you with days.
Because days remain on top, the next conversion factor needs to have days on the bottom
and hours on the top. Canceling days then leaves you with hours, so your next conversion

Q.
A silly chemistry student measures the mass of a sample of mystery metal to be 0.5 pounds
and measures the sample’s dimensions to be 1 cubic inch. When she realizes her error, she
attempts to convert her measurements into proper SI units. What should her units be, and
what’s the density of her sample (in those units)?
A.
The units should be g/mL or g/cm3, and the density is 1.4 × 10-2 g/mL.
The proper SI units for density are g/mL (g/cm3), so she should use the following method:
Notice that the conversion factors have been cleverly chosen so that all the non-SI units
cancel, leaving only SI units behind.
This answer is a little awkward and ought to be converted to scientific notation (see Chapter
1), such as 1.4 × 10–2. Or, you can be extra sneaky and use a metric conversion factor, which
allows you to do away with the scientific notation.

Answers to Questions on Using

The following are the answers to the practice problems presented in this chapter.
a
1 × 107 nm. Both 102 centimeters and 109 nanometers equal 1 meter. Set the two equal to one
another (102 cm = 109 nm) and solve for centimeters by dividing. This conversion tells you that
1 cm = 109/102 nm, or 1 × 107 nm.
b

12 g/mL. Because a milliliter is equivalent to 1 cubic centimeter, the first thing to do is to con-
vert all the length measurements to centimeters: 1 cm, 1.5 cm, and 0.5 cm. Then, multiply the
converted lengths to get the volume: 1 cm × 1.5 cm × 0.5 cm = 0.75 cm3, or 0.75 mL. The mass
should be expressed in grams rather than Dg; there are 10 grams in 1 decogram, so 0.9 Dg = 9g.
Using the formula D = m / V, you calculate a density of 9 grams per 0.75 milliliter, or 12 g/mL.

 Understanding isotopes and calculating atomic masses
 Ordering matter within different phases
“B
ig stuff is built from smaller pieces of stuff. If you keep breaking stuff down into
smaller and smaller pieces, eventually you’ll reach the smallest possible bit of
stuff. Let’s call that bit an atom.” This is how the Greek philosopher Democritus might have
explained his budding concept of “atomism” to a buddy over a flask of Cretan wine. Like
wine, the idea had legs.
For hundreds of years, scientists have operated under the idea that all matter is made up of
smaller building blocks called atoms. So small, in fact, that until the invention of the electron
microscope in 1931, the only way to find out anything about these tiny, mysterious particles
was to design a very, very clever experiment. Chemists couldn’t exactly corner a single atom
in a back alley somewhere and study it alone — they had to study the properties of whole
gangs of atoms and try to guess what individual ones might be like. Through remarkable
ingenuity and incredible luck, chemists now understand a great deal about the atom. After
reading this chapter, so will you.
You also discover that matter keeps you on your toes by shape-shifting. Samples of matter
can change from sturdy solids to loose liquids to ghostly gases, depending on conditions. All
three of these phases of matter have very specific comfort zones where they’re most likely to
exist, and by the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to predict likely phases based on tempera-
ture and pressure.
Building Atoms from Subatomic Particles
For now, picture an atom as a microscopic Lego. Atoms come in a variety of shapes and
sizes, and you can build larger structures out of them. Like a Lego, an atom is extremely hard
to break. In fact, so much energy is stored inside atoms that breaking them in half results in a
nuclear explosion. Boom!

An atom is made of smaller pieces, called subatomic particles, but it’s still considered the
smallest possible unit of an element, because after you break an atom of an element into sub-
atomic particles, the pieces lose the unique properties of that element.
Virtually all substances are made of atoms. The universe seems to use about 120 unique
atomic Lego blocks to build neat things like galaxies and people and whatnot. All atoms are
made of the same three subatomic particles: the proton, the electron, and the neutron.
Different types of atoms (in other words, different elements) have different combinations of
these particles, which gives each element unique properties. For example:
 Atoms of different elements have different masses. Atomic masses are measured in
multiples of the mass of a single proton, called atomic mass units (equivalent to 1.66 ×
10–27 kg), or amu. (We discuss atomic mass in more detail in the later section
“Accounting for Isotopes Using Atomic Masses.”)
 Two of the subatomic particles — the proton and the electron — have a charge, so
atoms with different numbers of these two particles have different atomic charges.
Atomic charges are measured in multiples of the charge of a single proton.
The must-know information about the three subatomic particles is summarized in Table 3-1.

Notice in Table 3-1 that protons and electrons have equal and opposite charges, and that
neutrons are neutral. Atoms always have an equal number of protons and electrons, so the
overall charge of an atom is neutral (that is to say, zero). Many atoms actually prefer to gain
or lose electrons, which causes them to gain a nonzero charge; in other words, the number of
negative charges is no longer balanced by the number of positive charges. Charged atoms
are called ions and are explained in Chapter 5. Until then, assume that all of our atoms have
equal numbers of protons and electrons.
Now look at Table 3-1 with an eye to mass. Protons and neutrons have the same mass.
Electrons have nearly 2,000 times less mass. This means that most of an atom’s mass comes
from protons and neutrons. Although electrons contribute a lot of negative charge, they con-
tribute very little mass.
Fine, you say. It’s all well and good that the subatomic particles have all these lovely proper-
ties, but what does an atom actually look like? Generations of ingenious scientists have tack-
led this question. The result of all the clever experimentation and tricky math has been a
series of models, each a bit more refined than the one before. The models are milestones in a
scientific story. Pop some corn, and read on.
34
Part I: Getting Cozy with Numbers, Atoms, and Elements 

J. J. Thomson: Cooking up the 
“plum pudding” model
The first subatomic particle was discovered by J. J. Thomson in the late 1800s. Thomson per-
formed a series of experiments using a device called a cathode ray tube, a contraption that
eventually evolved into the modern television. Thomson realized that a beam of electrons
(or a cathode ray, in scientific speak) could be deflected in a magnetic field. This result and
others got Thomson thinking that the whole “indivisible atom” model had its limitations;
atoms were actually composed of other, subatomic particles. Thomson proposed a model of
the atom, called the “plum pudding” model. You’ve probably never had the misfortune to
taste plum pudding, a traditional English dessert consisting of dried plums mixed into a thick
pudding. Thomson’s model was as important to chemistry as the dessert is foul tasting.
Thomson, like all chemists of his day, knew that two negative charges repel one another, so
he pictured the atom as a collection of evenly spaced, negatively charged particles. Thomson
called these charges corpuscles, but Thomson’s corpuscles have subsequently been awarded
the much nicer name electrons. Thomson also knew that the atom was electrically neutral
(meaning it has zero overall charge), so he figured the atom must also contain an amount of
positive charge equal to the negative charge of the electrons. Because the proton had not yet
been discovered, Thomson imagined this positive charge as a soup in which all of the nega-
tive electrons were suspended, just like plums are suspended in plum pudding.
Ernest Rutherford: Shooting at gold
The next leap forward was made by Ernest Rutherford in 1909. Rutherford set out to test
Thomson’s plum pudding model of the atom. To do so, Rutherford made an extremely thin
sheet of gold foil and shot alpha particles (helium nuclei) at it. This may sound a little crazy,
but there was method to Rutherford’s madness. If the plum pudding model were true,
Rutherford expected that when alpha particles crashed into the gold foil, loosely bound elec-
trons of the gold atoms would deflect the alpha particles by a few degrees at most. When
Rutherford attempted it, however, he found that 1 in every 8,000 (or so) alpha particles
deflected by 90 degrees or more! He famously compared the result to watching a shot bullet
bounce off a piece of tissue paper, a result perplexing enough to drop the jaw of even a jaded
chemist.
After much pondering, Rutherford eventually realized that most of an atom must be empty
space, and that most of the atom’s mass — and one of its two kinds of charge — must be con-
centrated at the center. So 7,999 of every 8,000 particles Rutherford shot at the foil missed
this tiny bundle of mass, passing straight through, but every so often a lucky shot smashed
into the nucleus and was deflected at a large angle.
We now know that the positive charge of an atom is concentrated at its center in the form of
protons. The protons reside there along with all of the atom’s neutrons. There is something
very strange and counterintuitive about this idea. Remember that like charges repel one
another; so having all the positive charge of an atom concentrated in one, tiny, central area is
truly bizarre. A very, very strong force must be holding together all those positive charges.
This force, unimaginatively dubbed the strong force, is something we can take for granted;
nuclear physicists can’t take it for granted, but that’s their headache.
35
Chapter 3: Organizing Matter into Atoms and Phases

Niels Bohr: Comparing the 
atom to the solar system
Enter Niels Bohr in the early 1900s. Dr. Bohr was not an experimentalist like Thomson or
Rutherford. Bohr was a theorist, which basically means he sat around pondering things. Having
pondered his way to an “aha” moment, his job became to prove his ideas mathematically.
Bohr was aware of Rutherford’s gold foil experiment. It occurred to Bohr that the atom may
operate very much like the solar system, with most of the mass concentrated in the center
(at the sun), with smaller bodies (the planets) orbiting the center at specific distances.
According to this model, low-mass electrons in an atom orbit the central nucleus, which con-
tains all the massive protons and neutrons. This conceptual leap was neat, logical, and crazy.
The understanding of electricity and magnetism at the time suggested that there was no way
for a negative charge to orbit at a constant distance from a positive charge. Classic theories
suggested that an orbiting electron would eventually spiral into a central nucleus.
Bohr bypassed this problem with a neat little trick called “quantization of angular momen-
tum.” Basically, Bohr invented a whole new set of rules for how electrons should behave in
an atom. Strangely enough, the predictions of his mathematical model matched experiments
so well that nobody could prove him wrong. Although now an entire branch of physics,
called quantum mechanics, is much more accurate than Bohr’s model, his predictions are so
nearly right and so convenient that we gratefully leave quantum mechanics to math-happy
physicists. We’ll stick with the picture painted for us by Bohr.

Q.
Rutherford’s gold atoms contained 197
nuclear particles, 79 of which were pro-
tons. How many neutrons and how many
electrons did each gold atom have?
A.
118 neutrons and 79 electrons. The
nucleus contains all of the protons and
neutrons in an atom, so if 79 of the 197
particles in a gold nucleus are protons, the
remaining 118 particles must be neutrons.
All atoms are electrically neutral, so
there must be a total of 79 electrons (in
other words, 79 negative charges) to bal-
ance out the 79 positive charges of the
protons. This type of logic leads us to a
general formula that can be used to cal-
culate proton or neutron counts. This
formula is M = P + N, where M is the
atomic mass, P is the number of protons,
and N is the number of neutrons.

Deciphering Chemical Symbols: 
Atomic and Mass Numbers
Two very important numbers tell us much of what we need to know about an atom: the
atomic number and the mass number. Chemists tend to memorize these numbers like baseball
fans memorize batting averages, but clever chemistry students like you need not resort to
memorization. You have the ever-important periodic table of the elements at your disposal.
We discuss the logical structure and organization of the periodic table in detail in Chapter 4,
so for now we simply introduce the meaning of the atomic and mass numbers without going
into great detail about their consequences.
Atomic numbers are like name tags — they identify an element as carbon, nitrogen, beryl-
lium, and so on by telling you the number of protons in the nucleus of that element. By the
numbers of their protons are atoms known. Adding a proton or removing one from the
nucleus of an atom changes the elemental identity of an atom.
Atoms are very fond of their identities, so simply adding or subtracting protons is quite 
difficult. Certain heavy elements can be split, and certain light elements can be smashed
together, in processes called nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, respectively. Splitting or join-
ing atomic nuclei releases a tremendous amount of energy and isn’t something you should
try at home, even if you do have a nuclear reactor in your basement.
The only other way for an atom to change its atomic number (and therefore its identity) is to
decay through a radioactive process. For most nuclei, this decay process happens about as
often as a chemist enters a high-end hair salon. Not that there’s anything wrong with that.
In the periodic table, you find the atomic number above the one- or two-letter abbreviation
for an element. The abbreviation is the element’s chemical symbol. Notice that the elements
of the periodic table are lined up in order of atomic number, as if they’ve responded to some
sort of roll call. Atomic number increases by 1 each time you move to the right in the peri-
odic table; when a row ends, the sequence of increasing atomic numbers begins again at the
left side of the next row down. You can check out the periodic table for yourself in Chapter 4.
37
Chapter 3: Organizing Matter into Atoms and Phases
3.
What is the mass in kilograms of the uranium nucleus (the heaviest of all naturally occurring
atoms) if it contains 92 protons and 146 neutrons?
Solve It

The second identifying number of an atom is its mass number. The mass number reports the
mass of the atom’s nucleus in amu. Because protons and neutrons weigh 1 amu each (as you
find out earlier in this chapter), the mass number equals the sum of the numbers of protons
and neutrons.
Why, you may wonder, don’t we care about the mass of the electrons? Is some sort of insidi-
ous subatomic particle-ism afoot? No. An electron has only 1⁄1,836 the mass of a proton or neu-
tron. So, to make mass numbers nice and even, chemists have decided to conveniently forget
that electrons have mass. Although this assumption is not, well, true, the contributions of
electrons to the mass of an atom are so small that the assumption is usually harmless.
To specify the atomic and mass numbers of an element, chemists typically write the symbol
of the element in the form 
, where Z is the atomic number, A is the mass number, and X is
the chemical symbol for that element.

A.
The answers to questions like these, favorites of chemistry teachers, are best organized in a
table. First, look up the symbols Cl, Os, and K in the periodic table (see Figure 3–1) and find
the names of these elements. Enter what you find in the first column. To fill in the second
and third columns, read the atomic number and mass number from the lower left and upper
left of the chemical symbols given in the question. The atomic number equals the number of
protons; the number of electrons is the same as the number of protons, because elements
have zero overall charge. So, fill in the fourth and fifth columns with the same numbers you
entered in column two. Lastly, subtract the atomic number from the mass number to get the
number of neutrons, and enter that value into column six. Voilá! The entire private lives of
each of these atoms is now laid before you. Your answer should look like the following table.

Accounting for Isotopes Using Atomic Masses
It’s Saturday night. The air is charged with possibility. Living in the moment, you peruse your
personal copy of the periodic table. What’s this? You notice the numbers that appear below
the atomic symbols appear to be related to the elements’ mass numbers — but they’re not
nice whole numbers. What could it all mean?
In the previous section, we explain that the mass number of an atom equals the sum of the
numbers of protons and neutrons in the atom’s nucleus. So, how can you have a fractional
number of protons or neutrons? There’s no such thing as half a proton, nor 0.25 neutron.
Your chemist’s sense of meticulousness has been offended, and you demand answers.
As it turns out, most elements come in several different varieties, called isotopes. Isotopes
are atoms of the same element that have different mass numbers; the differences in mass
number arise from different numbers of neutrons. The messy looking numbers with all those
decimal places are atomic masses. An atomic mass is a weighted average of the masses of all
the naturally occurring isotopes of an element. Chemists have measured the percentage of
each element that exists in different isotopic forms. In the weighted average of the atomic
mass, the mass of each isotope contributes in proportion to how often that isotope occurs in
nature. More common isotopes contribute more to the atomic mass.
But there’s more to the story of isotopes. Chemists are titillated by them. For Bohr’s sake,
why? A neutron is, after all, a neutral particle, so you wouldn’t think adding or subtracting
one would change much about an atom. Indeed, much of the time, adding a neutron doesn’t
significantly alter the properties of an element. But occasionally, adding but one seemingly
innocent little neutron can have sinister effects, pushing an atom over to the dark side, into
the realm of radioactivity. If an atom has just the right (or, perhaps, wrong) number of neu-
trons, it becomes unstable. When it comes to atomic nuclei, instability means radioactivity.
Unstable nuclei break down (or decay) into more stable forms. The less stable the nucleus,
the faster it tends to decay. When unstable nuclei decay, they tend to emit particles and
energy. These emissions are the source of radioactivity. The word radioactivity conjures up
images of three-headed frogs and fish with ten eyes, but radioactivity doesn’t deserve its bad
reputation. Many radioactive elements are harmless, and many have useful properties.
Consider the element carbon, for example. Carbon occurs naturally in three isotopes:
 Carbon-12 (
, or carbon with six protons and six neutrons) is boring, old, run-of-the-
mill carbon, accounting for 99 percent of all the carbon out there.
 Carbon-13 (
, or carbon with six protons and seven neutrons) is a slightly more rare
(though still dull) isotope, accounting for most of the remaining 1 percent of carbon
atoms. Taking on an extra neutron makes carbon-13 slightly heavier than carbon-12,
but does little else to change its properties.
However, even this minor change has some useful consequences. Scientists compare
the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 within meteorites to help determine their origin.
 Carbon-14 (
, or carbon with six protons and eight neutrons) shows its interesting
little face in only one out of every trillion or so carbon atoms. So if you’re thinking you
won’t be working with large samples of carbon-14 in your chemistry lab, you’re right!
Carbon-14, the most exotic and interesting isotope of carbon, is important in a technique
called radioactive dating. Carbon is the critical building block of organic molecules, including
those found in animal bodies. Because bodies contain trillions of trillions of trillions of carbon
atoms, the total amount of the rare carbon-14 is detectable. What’s more, carbon-14 is a

radioisotope, meaning that as it decays, it emits radiation. Before you go checking the mirror
to search for traces of a third eye, rest assured that the levels of naturally occurring carbon-
14 within your body won’t harm you. But those levels are sufficient to be useful to scientists
who want to determine the age of fossils. How?
Imagine Serena, a sultry Stone Age woman who met her untimely end 50,000 years ago,
caught tragically in the midst of a violent dispute between two of her suitors. While Serena
was alive, the carbon in her body was continually replenished, so that she consisted of about
99 percent carbon-12, 1 percent carbon-13, and 0.0000000001 percent carbon-14. When
Serena kicked the bucket, so did the biological processes that replenished the carbon in her
body. With their supply of carbon-14 cut off, Serena’s bones slowly became depleted of
carbon-14, as that isotope decayed into nitrogen.
Millennia later, paleontologists uncovering the dramatic site of Serena’s final moments can
dash straight to their friendly neighborhood chemist, Dr. Isotopian, with samples of Serena in
hand. With pride, and hiking up his pants to an unfashionable degree, Dr. Isotopian is able to
report Serena’s approximate age. Radioisotopes decay at highly predictable rates. By meas-
uring the relative levels of carbon isotopes in the sample of Serena, Dr. Isotopian can calcu-
late the time passed since Serena perished. Different elements have isotopes that decay at
different rates, so different isotopes can be used to date samples of wildly different ages.
Precise measurements of the amounts of different isotopes can be important. You need to
know the exact measurements if you’re asked to figure out an element’s atomic mass. To cal-
culate an atomic mass, you need to know the masses of the isotopes and the percent of the
element that occurs as each isotope (this is called the relative abundance). To calculate an
average atomic mass, make a list of each isotope along with its mass and its percent relative
abundance. Multiply the mass of each isotope by its relative abundance. Add the products.
The resulting sum is the atomic mass.
Certain elements, such as chlorine, occur in several very common isotopes, so their average
atomic mass isn’t close to a whole number. Other elements, such as carbon, occur in one
very common isotope and several very rare ones, resulting in an average atomic mass that is
very close to the whole-number mass of the most common isotope.
41

Q.
Chlorine occurs in two common isotopes. It appears as 
75.8% of the time and as 
24.2% of the time. What is its average atomic mass?
A.
35.48 amu. First, multiply each atomic mass by its relative abundance, using the fractional
form (75.8% = 0.758):
35 amu × 0.758 = 26.53 amu
37 amu × 0.242 = 8.95 amu
Then, add the two results together to get the average atomic mass. Compare the value to
the value on your periodic table. If you have done the calculation correctly, the two values
should match.
26.53 amu + 8.95 amu = 35.48 amu

Moving between the Phases of 
Solids, Liquids, and Gases
Elements are made up of atoms, and elements can exist in one of three common forms or
phases: solid, liquid, or gas. At room temperature, which is about 25 degrees Celsius (or 77
degrees Fahrenheit), and at atmospheric pressure, the majority of the elements on the peri-
odic table are either gases or solids. Only two elements, bromine and mercury, exist as liq-
uids under normal conditions. Look over Figure 3-1 to get a general feel for where on the
periodic table these solids, liquids, and gases hang out. Notice in particular that hydrogen
appears to have been kicked out of the gas clique that claims the right-hand side of the peri-
odic table.
As temperature and pressure change, an element can be pushed over the boundary from one
phase to another. Typically, low temperatures and high pressures promote solid forms, and
high temperatures and low pressures promote gaseous forms. Liquids occupy the middle
ground.
In chemistry, discussions of temperature often refer to the Kelvin scale, which you may not
have previously encountered. Boldly, the Kelvin scale sets its zero at a very extreme condi-
tion, called absolute zero. There is indeed something very absolute about this zero, because
it’s the temperature at which all particles freeze, ceasing all movement. Absolute zero is the
lowest possible temperature, representing the complete absence of heat. It’s as low as you
can possibly go. If you could reduce your temperature to absolute zero, you wouldn’t age. 
On the other hand, you wouldn’t be alive. Any takers?

Chapter 3: Organizing Matter into Atoms and Phases

In contrast to the Kelvin scale, the Celsius scale sets its zero at the freezing point of water.
Aside from that shift in zero-point, the two scales are identical. The size of a Celsius degree is
exactly equal to the size of a Kelvin degree. A Celsius temperature equals a Kelvin tempera-
ture plus 273 degrees. The freezing point of water is therefore a balmy 273 Kelvin (K).
At absolute zero, all elements are solids. At all temperatures greater than about 6,000K, all
elements are gaseous. Table 3-2 gives a sampling of common elements and the temperatures
at which they are solids, liquids, and gases.

Throughout this book, you often see a letter in parentheses following the chemical symbol of
an element, such as C(s), Br(l), or Ne(g). These designations are fairly straightforward: (s)
means the element is a solid, (l) means liquid, and (g) means gas.
We talk about transitions between phases at various temperatures and pressures in much
more detail in Chapter 10.

Q.
At what temperature in degrees Celsius
does bromine change phase from a liquid
to a gas?
A.
Bromine becomes a gas at 59°C. To
answer this question, refer to Table 3-2.
The table tells us that bromine is a solid
at temperatures below 267K, a liquid at
temperatures between 267K and 332K,
and a gas at temperatures above 332K.
Therefore, bromine undergoes a phase
transition from solid to liquid at 267K
and another transition from liquid to gas
at 332K. Because the liquid-gas transition
is the one concerning our question,
simply convert 332K into a Celsius tem-
perature by subtracting 273.

Answers to Questions on Organizing Matter
Now that you’ve organized the facts on atoms and phases into clearly labeled compart-
ments in your brain, see how accessible that information is. Check your answers to the
practice problems presented in this chapter.
a
175 inside, 71 outside. The nucleus of an atom consists of protons and neutrons, so this atom
(lutetium) has 175 particles in its nucleus. Electrons are the only subatomic particles that
aren’t included in the nucleus, so lutetium has 71 particles outside of its nucleus.
b
16 neutrons, 15 electrons. A nuclear mass of 31 amu means that the nucleus has 31 particles.
Because 15 of them are protons, that leaves 16 amu for the neutrons. The number of protons
and electrons are equal in a neutral atom (in this case, we’re talking about phosphorus), so the
atom has 15 electrons.
c
3.95 × 10–25 kg. First, calculate the atom’s mass number, which is 92 amu + 146 amu = 238 amu.
Next, convert this mass to kilograms by using the conversion factor 1 amu = 1.66 × 10–27 kg.
That’s right! The unit conversion haunts you once more! Set up this problem just as described
in Chapter 2.

When you’re given the atomic number, number of protons, or number of electrons, you auto-
matically know the other two numbers because they’re all equal. Each element in the periodic
table is listed with its atomic number, so by locating the element, you can simply read off the
atomic number and therefore the number of protons and electrons. To calculate the atomic
mass or the number of neutrons, you must be given one or the other. Calculate atomic mass by
adding the number of protons to the number of neutrons. Alternately, calculate the number of
neutrons by subtracting the number of protons from the atomic mass.

302K, 944K. The solid-liquid phase change for cesium occurs at 575°C, and the liquid-gas

from each.

here it hangs, looming ominously over the chemistry classroom, a formidable wall built
of bricks with names like “C,” “Ag,” and “Tc.” Behold, it’s the periodic table of the ele-
ments. But don’t be fooled by its stern appearance or intimidated by its teeming details. The
table is your friend, your guide, your key to making sense of chemistry. To begin to make
friends with the table, concentrate on its trends. Start simply: Notice that the table has rows
and columns. Keep your eye on the columns and rows, and soon you’ll be making sense of
things like electron affinity and atomic radii. Really.
Reading Periods and Groups 
in the Periodic Table
Take a look at your new friend, the periodic table, shown in Figure 4-1. Notice the horizontal
rows and the vertical columns of elements.
 The rows are called periods.
 The columns are called groups.
As you move across any period, you pass over a series of elements whose properties change
in a predictable way — predictability is the table’s way of showing you that it likes you. The
elements within any group have very similar properties. The properties of the elements
emerge mostly from their different numbers of protons and electrons (see Chapter 3 for a
refresher), and from the arrangement of their electrons. We explain how to predict the prop-
erties of elements from looking at the periodic table in the next section; for now, we just want
to describe how the elements are arranged in different periods and groups.

Starting on the far left of the periodic table is group IA (notice the group label atop each
column), also known as the alkali metals. These most metallic of elements are very reactive
(meaning they tend to combine with other elements) and are never found naturally in a pure
state, but in a bonded state. Group IIA is called the alkaline earth metals. Just like the alkali
metals, the alkaline earth metals are highly reactive.

Part I: Getting Cozy with Numbers, Atoms, and Elements 

The large central block of the periodic table is occupied by the transition metals, which are
mostly listed as group B elements. Transition metals have properties that vary from
extremely metallic, at the left side, to far less metallic, on the right side. The right-most
boundary of the transition metals is shaped like a staircase, shown in bold in Figure 4-1.
 Elements to the left of the staircase are metals (except hydrogen in group IA).
 Elements to the right of the staircase are nonmetals.
 Elements bordering the staircase (boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, tellurium,
polonium, and astatine) are called metalloids because they have properties between those
of metals and nonmetals. Chemists debate the membership of certain elements (espe-
cially polonium and astatine) within the metalloids, but the list given here reflects an
inclusive view. You can find these elements in groups IIIA, IVA, VA, VIA, and VIIA.
Metals tend to be solid and shiny, conduct electricity and heat, give up electrons, and be mal-
leable (easily shaped) and ductile (easily drawn out into wire). Nonmetals have properties
opposite those of metals. The most extreme nonmetals are the noble gases, in group VIIIA on
the far right of the table. The noble gases are inert, or extremely unreactive. One column to
the left, in group VIIA, is another key family of nonmetals, the halogens. In nature, the reac-
tive halogens tend to bond with metals to form salts, like sodium chloride (NaCl).
Be aware that some periodic tables use a different system for labeling the groups, in which
each column is simply numbered from 1 to 18, left to right.
So, elements within a group tend to have similar properties. The similarities result from the
fact that elements in a group have similar arrangements of electrons at their outermost
border or shell (we describe electron shells in greater detail in the next section).
As you move across a period, however, the properties of the elements tend to change gradually.
This slow change results mostly because the elements have different electron arrangements at
their outermost shell. By the time you reach the right edge of the periodic table (group VIIIA),
the elements’ outermost shells are completely full. As we describe later, full outer shells mean
that elements have no drive to react. The group VIIIA elements are called noble gases because
they seem to consider themselves above the other elements; it would be beneath them to react.
Periods 6 and 7 have an added wrinkle. Elements with atomic numbers 58–71 and 90–103 are
lifted out of the regular order and placed below the rest of the table. These two series are the
lanthanides and the actinides, respectively. These elements are separated from the table for
two main reasons. First, doing so prevents the table from being inconveniently wide. Second,
the lanthanides all have pretty similar properties, as do the actinides.
51
Chapter 4: Surveying the Periodic Table of the Elements
Q.
The elements within a group have widely
varying numbers of protons, neutrons,
and electrons. Why, then, do elements in
a group tend to have similar chemical
properties?
A.
Chemical properties come mostly from
the arrangement of electrons in the 
outermost shell of an atom. Although 
the elements at the top and bottom of a
given group (like fluorine and astatine,
for example) have very different num-
bers of protons, neutrons, and electrons,
the arrangements of electrons in their
outermost shells are very similar.

Predicting Properties from Periodic 
and Group Trends
The whole point of the periodic table, aside from providing interior decoration for chemistry
classrooms, is to help predict and explain the properties of the elements. These properties
change as a function of the numbers of protons and electrons in the element.
Increasing numbers of protons increase the positive charge of the nucleus, which contributes
to electron affinity, the attraction an atom has for an added electron. Within a period, the more
protons an element has, the stronger its electron affinity tends to be. This trend isn’t perfectly
smooth because other, more subtle factors are at work, but it’s a good general description of
what happens as you move across a period. Group VIIIA elements are an important exception.
These elements have full outer shells and have no use for an added electron.
Increasing the number of electrons changes the reactivity of the element in predictable ways,
based on how those electrons fill successive energy levels. Electrons in the highest energy
level occupy the outermost shell of the atom and are called valence electrons. Valence elec-
trons determine whether an element is reactive or unreactive and are the electrons involved
in bonding (which we talk about in Chapter 5). Because chemistry is really about the making
and breaking of bonds, valence electrons are the most important particles for chemistry.
Atoms are most stable when their valence shells are completely filled with electrons.
Chemistry happens as a result of atoms attempting to fill the valence shells. Alkali metals in
group IA of the periodic table are so reactive because they need only give up one electron to

have a completely filled valence shell. Halogens in group VIIA are so reactive because they
need only acquire one electron to have a completely filled valence shell. The elements within a
group tend to have the same number of valence electrons, and for that reason tend to have
similar chemical properties. Elements in groups IA and IIA tend to react strongly with elements
in group VIIA. Group B elements tend to react less strongly.
Elements in the A groups have the same number of valence electrons as the Roman numeral
of their group. For example, magnesium in group IIA has two valence electrons.
In addition to reactivity, another property that varies across the table is atomic radius, or the
geometric size (not the mass) of the atoms. As you move down or to the right on the periodic
table, elements have both more protons and more electrons. However, only as you move
down the table do the added electrons occupy higher energy levels. So, atomic radius tends
to decrease as you move to the right because the increasing positive charge of the nuclei
pulls inwardly on the electrons of that energy level. As you move down the table, atomic
radius tends to increase because, even though you are adding positively charged protons to
the nucleus, you are now adding electrons to higher and higher energy levels, which corre-
spond to larger and larger electron shells. So you can make good estimates about the relative
sizes of the radii of different elements by comparing their placement in the periodic table.
53
Chapter 4: Surveying the Periodic Table of the Elements
Q.
Chromium has more electrons than scan-
dium. Why, then, does scandium have a
larger atomic radius?
A.
Even though chromium has more elec-
trons than scandium, those extra elec-
trons occupy the same energy level
because the two elements are in the
same row on the periodic table.
Furthermore, chromium has more pro-
tons than scandium (as you can tell by
chromium’s position to the right of scan-
dium), creating a more positively
charged nucleus that pulls the electrons
of a given energy level inward, thereby
decreasing the atomic radius.

Seeking Stability with Valence 
Electrons by Forming Ions
Elements are so insistent about having filled valence shells that they’ll gain or lose valence
electrons to do so. Atoms that gain or lose electrons in this way are called ions. You can pre-
dict what kind of ion many elements will form simply by looking at their position on the peri-
odic table. With the exception of row 1 (hydrogen and helium), all elements are most stable
(think “happiest”) with a full shell of eight valence electrons, known as an octet. Atoms tend
to take the shortest path to a complete octet, whether that means ditching a few electrons to
achieve a full octet at a lower energy level, or grabbing extra electrons to complete the octet
at their current energy level. In general, metals on the left side of the periodic table (and in
the middle) tend to lose electrons, and nonmetals on the right tend to gain electrons.
More specifically, you can predict just how many electrons an atom will gain or lose to
become an ion. Group IA (alkali metal) elements lose one electron. Group IIA (alkaline earth
metal) elements lose two electrons. Things get unpredictable in the transition metal region,
but get predictable once more with the nonmetals. Group VIIA (halogen) elements gain one
electron. Group VIA elements tend to gain two electrons, and group VA elements tend to gain
three electrons. In short, elements tend to lose or gain as many electrons as necessary to
have valence shells resembling the elements in group VIIIA, the noble gases.

When atoms become ions, they lose the one-to-one balance between their protons and elec-
trons, and therefore acquire an overall charge.
 Atoms that lose electrons (like metals) acquire positive charge, becoming cations, such
as Na+ or Mg2+.
 Atoms that gain electrons (like nonmetals) acquire negative charge, becoming anions,
such as Cl– or O2–.
The superscripted numbers and signs in the atoms’ symbols indicate the ion’s overall
charge. Cations have superscripts with “+” signs, and anions have superscripts with “–”
signs. When the element sodium, Na, loses an electron, it loses one negative charge and is
left with one overall positive charge. So, Na becomes Na+.

Q.
Fluorine and sodium are only two atomic
numbers apart on the periodic table.
Why then does fluorine form an anion, 
F–, whereas sodium forms a cation, Na+?
A.
Fluorine (F) is in group VIIA, just one
group to the left of the noble gases, and
therefore needs to gain only one electron
to complete a valence octet. Sodium 
(Na) lies just one group to the right of
the noble gases, having wrapped around
into group IA of the next energy level.
Therefore, sodium needs to lose only one
electron to achieve a full valence octet.

Putting Electrons in Their Places: 
Electron Configurations
An awful lot of detail goes into determining just how many electrons an atom has (see the
previous sections). The next step is to figure out where those electrons live. Several different
schemes exist for annotating all of this important information, but the electron configuration
is a type of shorthand that captures much of the pertinent information.
Each numbered row of the periodic table corresponds to a different principal energy level,
with higher numbers indicating higher energy. Within each energy level, electrons can
occupy different orbitals. Different types of orbitals have slightly different energy levels. Each
orbital can hold up to two electrons, but electrons won’t double up within an orbital unless
no other open orbitals exist at the same energy level. Electrons fill up orbitals from the
lowest energies to the highest, as the rest of us would probably do if we were electrons.
There are four types of orbitals: s, p, d, and f.
 Row 1 consists of a single 1s orbital. A single electron in this orbital corresponds to the
electron configuration of hydrogen, written as 1s1. The superscript written after the
symbol for the orbital indicates how many electrons occupy that orbital. Filling the
orbital with two electrons, 1s2, corresponds to the electron configuration of helium.
Each higher principal energy level contains its own s orbital (2s, 3s, and so on), and
these orbitals are the first to fill within those levels.
 In addition to s orbitals, principal energy levels 2 and higher contain p orbitals. There
are three p orbitals at each level, accommodating a maximum of six electrons. Because
the three p orbitals (also known as px, py, and pz) have equal energy, they are each filled
with a single electron before any receives a second electron. The elements in rows 2
and 3 on the periodic table contain only s and p orbitals. The p orbitals of each energy
level are filled only after the s orbital is filled.
 Rows 4 and higher on the periodic table include d orbitals, of which there are five at each
principal energy level, accommodating a maximum of ten electrons. Rows 5 and higher
include f orbitals, numbering seven at each level, accommodating a maximum of 14 elec-
trons. d orbital electrons are a major feature of the transition metals. f orbital electrons
are a hallmark of the lanthanides and the actinides (see the “Reading Periods and Groups
in the Periodic Table” section, earlier in this chapter, for more on these rows).

After you get to row 4, the exact order in which you fill the energy levels can get a bit confus-
ing. To keep things straight, it’s useful to refer to the Aufbau filling diagram, shown in Figure
4-2. To use the diagram, start at the bottom and work your way up, from the lowest arrows to
the highest. For example, always start by filling 1s, then fill 2s, then 2p, then 3s, then 4s, then
3d, and so on.
Sadly, there are a few exceptions to the tidy picture presented by the Aufbau filling diagram.
Copper, chromium, and palladium are notable examples (see Chapter 25 for more informa-
tion on these). Without going into teeth-grinding detail, these exceptional electron configura-
tions arise from situations where electrons get transferred from their proper, Aufbau-filled
orbitals to create half-filled or entirely filled sets of d orbitals; these half- and entirely filled
states are more stable than the states produced by pure Aufbau-based filling.
To come up with a written electron configuration, you first determine how many electrons
the atom in question actually has. Then you assign those electrons to orbitals, one electron
at a time, from the lowest energy orbitals to the highest. In a given type of orbital (like a 2p or
3d orbital, for example), you only place two electrons within the same orbital when there is
no other choice. For example, suppose you want to find the electron configuration of carbon.
Carbon has six electrons, the same as the number of its protons as described by its atomic
number (see Chapter 3 for more about atomic numbers), and it’s in row 2 of the periodic
table. First, the s orbital of level 1 is filled. Then, the s orbital of level 2 is filled. These orbitals
each accept two electrons, leaving two more with which to fill the p orbitals of level 2. Each
of the remaining electrons would occupy a separate p orbital. You wind up with 1s22s22p2.
(Only at oxygen, 1s22s22p4, would electrons begin to double up in the 2p orbitals, indicated by
the superscript 4 on the p.)
Electron configurations can get a bit long to write. For this reason, you may sometimes see
them written in a condensed form, like [Ne]3s23p3. This condensed configuration is the one
for phosphorus. The expanded electron configuration for phosphorus is 1s22s22p63s23p3. To
abbreviate the configuration, simply go backward in atomic numbers until you hit the near-
est noble gas (which, in the case of phosphorus, is neon). That symbol for that noble gas,
laced within brackets, becomes the new starting point for the configuration. Next, simply
include the standard configuration for those electrons beyond the noble gas (which, in the
case of phosphorus, includes two electrons in 3s and three electrons in 3p). The condensed
form simply means that the atom’s electron configuration is just like that of neon, with addi-
tional electrons filled into orbitals 3s and 3p as annotated.

Chapter 4: Surveying the Periodic Table of the Elements

Ions have different electron configurations than their parent atoms because ions are created
by gaining or losing electrons. As you find out in the previous section, atoms tend to gain or
lose electrons so they can achieve full valence octets, like those of the noble gases. Guess
what? The resulting ions have precisely the same electron configurations as those noble
gases. So, by forming the Br– anion, bromine achieves the same electron configuration as the
noble gas, krypton.

Measuring the Amount of Energy (Or Light) 
an Excited Electron Emits
Electrons can jump between energy levels by absorbing or releasing energy. When an elec-
tron absorbs an amount of energy exactly equivalent to the difference in energy between
levels (a quantum of energy), the electron jumps to the higher energy level. This jump in
energy creates an excited state. Excited states don’t last forever; the lower-energy ground state
is more stable. Excited electrons tend to release amounts of energy equivalent to the differ-
ence between energy levels, and thereby return to ground state. The discrete particles of
light that correspond to quanta of energy are called photons.
Light has properties of both a particle and a wave. A lovely result arises from light’s proper-
ties: You can measure differences in electron energies simply by measuring the wavelengths
of light emitted from excited atoms. In this way, you can identify different elements within a
sample. The first basic relationship behind this technique is
Speed of light (c) = Wavelength (λ) × Frequency (ν)
where c = 3.00 × 108 m s–1. Frequency, ν, is often expressed in reciprocal seconds (1/s or s–1),
also known as hertz (1 Hz = 1 s–1).
But what about energy? What’s the relationship between frequency and energy? It must be
ridiculously complicated, right? Wrong. The second basic relationship relating light to energy is
Energy (E) = Planck’s constant (h) × Frequency (ν)
where Planck’s constant, h = 6.626 × 10–34 J · s.
Here, J stands for joules, the International System (SI) unit of energy. Frequency is expressed
in hertz (Hz), where 1 hertz is 1 inverse second (s-1). So, multiplying a frequency by Planck’s
constant yields joules, the units of energy.

Answers to Questions on the Periodic Table
Here are the answers to the practice problems in this chapter. Pat yourself on the
back, whether in congratulation or consolation.
a
Metals are found to the left of the staircase, with the exception of hydrogen, and nonmetals are
found to the right of the staircase. Several elements adjoining the staircase are classified as
metalloids.
a. selenium (Se) = nonmetal
b. fluorine (F) = nonmetal
c. strontium (Sr) = metal
d. chromium (Cr) = metal
e. bismuth (Bi) = metal
b
The noble gases are described as “noble” because they seem to consider it beneath themselves
to react with other elements. Because these elements have completely filled valence shells,
they have no energetic reason to react. They’re already as stable as they can be.
c
Barium’s atomic radius is larger. Atomic size tends to increase from top to bottom and from
right to left. Barium (Ba) is farther down and to the left on the periodic table than silicon (Si).
d
Silicon has stronger electron affinity. Electron affinity tends to increase from left to right.
e
When you’re looking at elements in A groups, the number of valence electrons matches the ele-
ment’s group number.
a. Iodine (I) has seven valence electrons because it’s in group VIIA.
b. Oxygen (O) has six valence electrons because it’s in group VIA.
c. Calcium (Ca) has two valence electrons because it’s in group IIA.
d. Hydrogen (H) has one valence electron because it’s in group IA.
e. Germanium (Ga) has four valence electrons because it’s in group IVA.
f
Valence electrons are important because they occupy the highest energy level in the outermost
shell of the atom. As a result, valence electrons are the electrons that see the most action, as in
forming bonds, or being gained or lost to form ions. The number of valence electrons in an
atom largely determines the chemical reactivity of that atom.
g
a. Lithium (Li) loses one electron, forming lithium cation Li+.
b. Selenium (Se) gains two electrons to form selenium anion Se2–.
Elements seek stable valence shells like those of the noble gases by gaining or losing electrons.
Whether an element gains or loses electrons has to do with where that elements sits in the peri-
odic table. For elements on the left side, losing just a few electrons is easier than gaining many
more; for these elements, the Roman numeral of the A group to which they belong tells you
how many electrons they lose — and therefore tells you their positive charge. For elements on
the right side of the table, gaining a few electrons is easier than losing many more; these ele-
ments gain the number of electrons necessary to create valence shells like those in group VIIIA
(the noble gases). An element in group VIA therefore gains two electrons.
h
N3–, also known as nitride or nitrogen anion. By gaining three electrons, nitrogen, which is in
group VA, assumes a full octet, like neon.
61

i
Be2+, also known as beryllium cation. By losing two electrons, beryllium, which is in group IIA,
assumes a full octet valence shell, with two electrons like helium.

bromine is 1s22s22p63s23p64s23d104p5. Bromine is in row 4, so consolidate the electron configura-
tions of rows 1 through 3 as [Ar], because argon is the last element in row 3. Then add to [Ar]
the configuration of the remaining electrons, which fill 4s23d104p5.
m
All three have the configuration 1s22s22p63s23p6, the configuration of the noble gas argon
(Ar). Both chlorine (Cl) and potassium (K) seek stable, full octet configurations by forming
ions.

hemistry begins when elements start making friends.
A compound is a group of elemental friends. Some
friends are closer than others. Potential new friends test
old alliances, sometimes breaking them to form new ones.
In other words, reactions occur. This part investigates
compounds and bonds, the forces that hold compounds
together. Because the friendly population of elements and
compounds is so large, we introduce the concept of the
mole, a really big number that makes counting countless
compounds infinitely easier. We also introduce you to
reactions, the dramatic dialogue of elements and com-
pounds that underlies all chemical change.

any atoms are prone to public displays of affection, pressing themselves against
other atoms in an intimate electronic embrace called bonding. Atoms bond with one
another by playing various games with their valence electrons. In this chapter, we describe
the basic rules of those games.
Because valence electrons are so important to bonding, problems involving bonding some-
times make use of electron dot structures, symbols that represent valence electrons as dots
surrounding an atom’s chemical symbol. You should be able to draw and interpret electron
dot structures for atoms as shown in Figure 5-1. This figure shows the electron dot structures
for elements in the periodic table’s first two rows; notice that the valence shells progres-
sively fill moving from left to right. To determine the electron dot structure of any element,
count the number of electrons in that element’s valence shell. Then draw that number of
dots around the chemical symbol for the element. Chapter 4 describes some of the factors
that determine whether atoms gain or lose electrons to form ions. You should make sure to
understand those patterns before attacking this chapter.

Pairing Charges with Ionic Bonds
Atoms of some elements, like metals, can easily lose valence electrons to form cations (atoms
with positive charge) that have stable electron configurations. Atoms of other elements, like
the halogens, can easily gain valence electrons to form anions (atoms with negative charge)
with stable electron configurations. Cations and anions experience electrostatic attraction to
one another because opposite charges attract. So, a cation will snuggle up to an anion, given
the chance. This event is called ionic bonding, and it happens because the energy of the ioni-
cally bonded ions is lower than the energy of the ions when they are separated.
You can think of an ionic bond as resulting from the transfer of an electron from one atom to
another, as shown in Figure 5-2 for sodium and chlorine. Metals (like sodium) tend to give up
their electrons to nonmetals (like chlorine) because nonmetals are much more electronega-
tive (they more strongly attract electrons within a bond to themselves). The greater the dif-
ference in electronegativity between the two ions, the more ionic (or completely uneven in
sharing of electrons) is the bond that forms between them.
Although ions are often individual, charged atoms, there are also many examples of poly-
atomic ions (charged particles made up of more than one atom). Examples of common poly-
atomic ions are ammonium, NH4
+, and sulfate, SO4
2–. We cover polyatomic ions in detail in
Chapter 6.
When cations and anions associate in ionic bonds, they form ionic compounds. At room tem-
perature, most ionic compounds are solid because of the strong electrostatic forces that
hold together the ions within them. The ions in ionic solids tend to pack together in a lattice,
a highly organized, regular arrangement that allows for the maximum electrostatic interac-
tion between anions and cations. The geometric details of the packing can differ among dif-
ferent ionic compounds, but a simple lattice structure is shown in Figure 5-3. Flip to Chapter
6 for full details on ionic compounds.
The strong electrostatic forces that hold together ionic lattices result in the high melting 
and boiling points that are common among ionic compounds (see Chapter 10 for general

information on melting and boiling points). Although it may take a great deal of thermal
energy to disrupt ionic bonds, ionic compounds are usually easily dissolved in water or in
other polar solvents (fluids made up of molecules that have unevenly distributed charge).
When the solvent molecules are polar, they can engage in favorable interactions with the
ions that help to compensate for disrupting the ionic bonds. For example, polar water mole-
cules can interact well with both sodium cations (Na+) and chlorine anions (Cl-). Water mole-
cules are polar because they have distinct and separate bits of positive and negative charge.
Water molecules can orient their positive bits toward Cl- and their negative bits toward Na+.
Positive charges attract negative charges and vice versa, so these kinds of interactions are
favorable — they require less energy. So, water dissolves solid NaCl quite well because the
water-ion interactions can compete with the (Na+)-(Cl-) interactions.
When ionic compounds are melted or dissolved, so the individual ions can move about, the
resulting liquid is a very good conductor of electricity. Ionic solids, however, are often poor
conductors of electricity.
Salts are a common variety of ionic compound. A salt is formed from the reaction between a
base and an acid. For example, hydrochloric acid reacts with sodium hydroxide to form the
salt sodium chloride and water:
HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) →NaCl(aq) + H2O(l)
Note that aq indicates that the substance is dissolved in water, in an aqueous solution.

Q.
Why do metals tend to form ionic com-
pounds with nonmetals?
A.
Metals are much less electronegative
than nonmetals, meaning that they give
up valence electrons much more easily.
Nonmetals (especially group VIIA and
VIA nonmetals) very easily gain new
valence electrons. So, metals and non-
metals tend to form bonds in which the
metal atoms entirely surrender valence
electrons to the nonmetals. Bonds with
extremely unequal electron-sharing are
called ionic bonds.

Sharing Charge with Covalent Bonds
Sometimes the way for atoms to reach their most stable, lowest-energy states is to share
valence electrons. When atoms share valence electrons, we say that they are engaged in
covalent bonding. The very word covalent means “together in valence.” Compared to ionic
bonding, covalent bonding tends to occur between atoms of similar electronegativity, most
especially between nonmetals.
Just as ionic bonds tend to form in such a way that both atoms end up with completely filled
valence shells, the atoms involved in covalent bonds tend to share electrons in such a way
that each ends up with a completely filled valence shell. The shared electrons are attracted
to the nuclei of both atoms, forming the bond. The simplest and best studied covalent bond
is the one formed between two hydrogen atoms, shown in Figure 5-4. Separately, each atom
has only one electron with which to fill its 1s orbital. By forming a covalent bond, each atom
lays claim to two electrons within the molecule of dihydrogen. The figure shows various
ways in which a covalent bond can be represented, explicitly depicting the valence shells (a),
by using electron dot structures (b), or by signifying a shared pair of electrons with a single
line (c). The latter two ways to show bonding are referred to as Lewis structures.

Atoms can share more than a single pair of electrons. When atoms share two pairs of elec-
trons, they are said to form a double bond, and when they share three pairs of electrons they
are said to form a triple bond. Examples of double and triple bonds are shown with electron
dot and line structures in Figure 5-5.
A few guidelines can help you figure out the correct Lewis structure for a molecule if you
know the molecule’s formula. As an example, we work out the Lewis structure of formalde-
hyde, CH2O (Figure 5-6 can help you follow along):
1. Add up all the valence electrons for all the atoms in the molecule.
These are the electrons you can use to build the structure. Account for any extra or
missing electrons in the case of ions. For example, if you know your molecule has +2
charge, remember to subtract two from the total number of valence electrons. In the
case of formaldehyde, C has four valence electrons, each H has one valence electron,
and O has six valence electrons. The total number of valence electrons is 12.
2. Pick a “central” atom to serve as the anchor of your Lewis structure.
The central atom is usually one that can form the most bonds, which is often the atom
with the most empty valence orbital slots to fill. In larger molecules, some trial-and-error
may be involved in this step, but in smaller molecules, some choices are obviously better
than others. For example, carbon is a better choice than hydrogen to be the central
atom because carbon tends to form four bonds, whereas hydrogen tends to form only
one bond. In the case of formaldehyde, carbon is the obvious first choice because it can
form four bonds, while oxygen can form only two, and each hydrogen can form only one.

Chapter 5: Building Bonds

3. Connect the other, “outer” atoms to your central atom using single bonds only.
Each single bond counts for two electrons. In the case of formaldehyde, attach the
single oxygen and each of the two hydrogen atoms to the central carbon atom.
4. Fill the valence shells of your outer atoms. Then put any remaining electrons on the
central atom.
In our example, carbon and oxygen should each have eight electrons in their valence
shells; each hydrogen atom should have two. However, by the time we fill the valence
shells of our outer atoms (oxygen and the two hydrogens), we have used up our allot-
ment of 12 electrons.
5. Check whether the central atom now has a full valence shell.
If the central atom has a full valence shell, then your Lewis structure is drawn properly —
it’s formally correct even though it may not correspond to a real structure. If the central
atom still has an incompletely filled valence shell, then use electron dots (nonbonding
electrons) from outer atoms to create double and/or triple bonds to the central atom
until the central atom’s valence shell is filled. Remember, each added bond requires two
electrons. In the case of our formaldehyde molecule, we must create a double bond
between carbon and one of the outer atoms. Oxygen is the only choice for a double-bond
partner, because each hydrogen can accommodate only two electrons in its shell. So, we
use two of the electrons assigned to oxygen to create a second bond with carbon.
Sometimes a covalent bond is formed in which one atom donates both electrons to the bond,
with the other atom contributing no electrons. This kind of bond is called a coordinate cova-
lent bond. Atoms with lone pairs are capable of donating both electrons to a coordinate cova-
lent bond. A lone pair consists of two electrons paired within the same orbital that aren’t
used in bonding. Even though covalent bonding usually occurs between nonmetals, metals
can engage in coordinate covalent bonding. Usually, the metal receives electrons from an
electron donor called a ligand.
Sometimes a given set of atoms can covalently bond with each other in multiple ways to
form a compound. This situation leads to something called resonance. Each of the possible
bonded structures is called a resonance structure. The actual structure of the compound is a
resonance hybrid, a sort of average of all the resonance structures. For example, if two atoms
are connected by a single bond in one resonance structure, and the same two atoms are con-
nected by a double bond in a second resonance structure, then those atoms are connected
by a bond in the resonance hybrid that is worth 11⁄2 single bonds. A common example of reso-
nance is found in ozone, O3, shown in Figure 5-7.

Q.
Draw a Lewis structure for propene, C3H6.
A.
First, add up the total valence electrons.
Each carbon contributes 4 electrons, 
and each hydrogen contributes 1, for a
total of 18 valence electrons. Next, pick a
central atom. The best choice is a carbon
atom because carbon can form four bonds,
more than any hydrogen. Connect the
remaining atoms to the central carbon
with single bonds. To connect all the
atoms into one molecule, the central
carbon must be connected to each of 
the two other carbon atoms. These 
connections use up 16 of the 18 valence
electrons, leaving 2 electrons that you
can place onto one of the carbon atoms.
One carbon atom in the structure still
requires two additional electrons to fill
its valence shell. The only way to fill this
shell is to create a carbon-carbon double
bond. Only one arrangement of hydrogen
atoms to the three carbons allows you to
fill all the carbon valence shells, as you

Occupying and Overlapping Molecular Orbitals
Chapter 4 describes how electrons occupy distinct orbitals within atoms. When atoms cova-
lently bond to form molecules, the shared electrons are no longer constrained to those
atomic orbitals, but occupy molecular orbitals, larger regions that form from the overlap of
atomic orbitals. Just as different atomic orbitals are associated with different levels of
energy, so are molecular orbitals. A stable covalent bond forms between two atoms because
the energy of the molecular orbital associated with the bond is lower than the combined
energies associated with the atomic orbitals of the separated atoms.
Because electrons have wave-like properties, atomic orbitals can overlap in different ways
depending on the relationship between the waves of the shared electrons.
 In one mode, the electron waves interact favorably (with low energy) and together
occupy a bonding orbital.
 In another mode, the electron waves interact unfavorably within a higher-energy anti-
bonding orbital.
The energy relationships between unbound atoms and different types of molecular orbitals
are summarized within molecular orbital diagrams, such as the one shown for dihydrogen in
Figure 5-8. In this figure, two hydrogen atoms each contribute a single electron from a 1s orbital
to a sigma (σ) bonding orbital. The low-energy bonding orbital is favored over the higher-
energy sigma antibonding (σ*) orbital. This illustrates a general principle: Given a choice
between high- and low-energy states, molecules prefer the low-energy states. This preference
for lower energy is what is meant by favorable (low energy) versus unfavorable (high energy).

In addition to differences in the interaction of electron waves, covalent bonds can differ
based on the shape of the molecular orbitals.
 When atomic orbitals overlap in such a way that the resulting molecular orbital is sym-
metrical with respect to the bond axis (the line connecting the two bonded atoms), we
say that a σ bond (sigma bond) is formed.
 When atomic orbitals overlap in such a way that the resulting molecular orbital is sym-
metric with the bond axis in only one plane, we say that a π bond (pi bond) is formed.
Sigma bonds are stronger than pi bonds because the electrons within sigma bonds lie
directly between the two atomic nuclei. The negatively charged electrons in sigma bonds
therefore experience favorable (as in, low-energy) attraction to the positively charged nuclei.
Electrons in pi bonds are farther away from the nuclei, so they experience weaker attraction.
Sigma bonds form when s or p orbitals overlap in a head-on manner. Single bonds are usually
sigma bonds. Pi bonds form when adjacent p orbitals overlap above and below the bond
axis. These situations are depicted in Figure 5-9.

Q.
Both sigma bonds and pi bonds have a
kind of symmetry with respect to the two
atoms in the bond. What is the difference
in a sigma bond’s symmetry versus a pi
bond’s symmetry?
A.
In any bond between two atoms, you can
imagine an imaginary line (the bond axis)
that connects the center of one atom to
the center of the other atom. Sigma
bonds are perfectly symmetrical around
this line; you can imagine the sigma 
bond as a kind of tube that wraps around
the bond axis. If you were to rotate the
bonded atoms around the imaginary line,
the bond would look the same all the
way around. Pi bonds are symmetric to
the bond axis in only one plane. You can
imagine the two atoms pressed onto a
flat surface; the bond axis is the imagi-
nary line on this surface. The pi bonds
connect the two atoms above the line
and below the line. If you were to rotate
the bonded atoms around the imaginary
line, the pi bonds would rise up off the
surface and sink below the surface as
you rotated them, like the planks on a
paddlewheel rise above the surface of
the water and then sink below the sur-
face of the water.

Tugging on Electrons within Bonds: Polarity
The earlier sections on ionic bonding and covalent bonding refer to the concept of elec-
tronegativity, or the tendency of an atom to draw electrons toward itself. Ionic bonds form

between atoms with large differences in electronegativity, whereas covalent bonds form
between atoms with smaller differences in electronegativity. In truth, there is no natural dis-
tinction between the two types of bonds; they lie on opposite sides of a spectrum of polarity,
or unevenness in the distribution of electrons within a bond.
The greater the difference in electronegativity between two atoms, the more polar is the
bond that forms between them. Imagine the electrons in the bond as being spread out into a
cloud within the molecular orbital. In polar bonds, the cloud is denser in the vicinity of the
more electronegative atom. In nonpolar bonds, like those formed between atoms of the same
element, the cloud is evenly distributed between both atoms. Polar bonds have more ionic
character, whereas nonpolar bonds have more covalent character. Here’s how to distinguish
the character of a bond:
 Usually, a difference in electronegativity less than about 0.3 means that the correspon-
ding covalent bond is considered nonpolar.
 Differences in electronegativity ranging from 0.3 to about 1.7 correspond to increas-
ingly polar covalent bonds.
 Above about 1.7, the bond is increasingly considered ionic.
The electronegativities of the elements are displayed in Figure 5-10 and help make clear why
atoms that lie horizontally farther from each other on the periodic table tend to form more
polar bonds.
Differences in the electronegativity of atoms create polarity in bonds between those atoms.
The polar bonds within a molecule add to create polarity in the molecule as a whole. The
precise way in which the individual bonds contribute to the overall polarity of the molecule
depends on the shape of the molecule.
 If two very polar bonds point in opposite directions, their polarities cancel out.
 If the two polar bonds point in the same direction, their polarities add.
 If the two polar bonds point at each other so they’re diagonal to one another, their
polarities cancel in one direction but add in a perpendicular direction.
Because electrons are distributed unevenly within a polar covalent bond, the more elec-
tronegative atom takes on a partial negative charge, signified by the symbol δ–. The less elec-
tronegative atom takes on a partial positive charge, δ+. This difference in charge along the
axis of the bond is called a dipole. Individual bonds have dipoles, which sum over all the
bonds of a molecule (taking geometry into account) to create a molecular dipole. In addition
to the permanent dipoles created by polar bonds, instantaneous dipoles can be temporarily
created within nonpolar bonds and molecules. Both kinds of dipoles play important roles in
the interactions between molecules. Permanent dipoles lead to dipole-dipole interactions
and to hydrogen bonds. Instantaneous dipoles lead to attractive London forces (flip to
Chapters 10 and 12 for details on how these kinds of forces affect molecules in solutions).

Q.
Why doesn’t it make sense to ask
whether an element (like hydrogen or 
fluorine) engages in polar bonds versus
nonpolar bonds?
A.
Whether an element engages in polar or
nonpolar bonds can only be answered
with respect to specific bonds with other
elements. For example, hydrogen engages
in a perfectly nonpolar covalent bond with
another hydrogen atom in the molecule
H2. Likewise, fluorine engages in a nonpo-
lar bond with another fluorine atom in F2.
On the other hand, the bond between
hydrogen and fluorine in the compound
HF is very polar. The polarity of a bond
depends on the difference in electronega-
tivity between the bonded atoms.

Shaping Molecules: VSEPR Theory 
and Hybridization
We’ll start with the hard part: VSEPR stands for valence shell electron pair repulsion. Okay,
now it gets easier. VSEPR is simply a model that helps predict and explain why molecules
have the shapes they do. Molecule shapes help determine how molecules interact with each
other. For example, molecules that stack nicely on one another are more likely to form solids.
And two molecules that can fit together so their reactive bits lie closer together in space are
more likely to react with one another.

The basic principle underlying VSEPR theory is that valence electron pairs, whether they are
lone pairs or occur within bonds, prefer to be as far from one another as possible. There’s no
sense in crowding negative charges any more than necessary.
Of course, when multiple pairs of electrons participate in double or triple covalent bonds,
those electrons stay within the same bonding axis. Lone pairs repel other lone pairs more
strongly than they repel bonding pairs, and the weakest repulsion is between two pairs of
bonding electrons. Two lone pairs separate themselves as far apart as they can go, on exact
opposite sides of an atom if possible. Electrons involved in bonds also separate themselves
as far apart as they can go, but with less force than two lone pairs. In general, all electron
pairs try to maintain the maximum mutual separation. But when an atom is bonded to many
other atoms, the “ideal” of maximum separation isn’t always possible because bulky groups
bump into one another. So, the final shape of a molecule emerges from a kind of negotiation
between competing interests.
VSEPR theory predicts several shapes that appear over and over in real-life molecules. These
shapes are summarized in Figure 5-11.
Consider one beautifully symmetrical shape predicted by VSEPR theory: the tetrahedron.
Four equivalent pairs of electrons in the valence shell of an atom should distribute them-
selves into such a shape, with equal angles and equal distance between each pair. But what
sort of atom has four equivalent electron pairs in its valence shell? Aren’t valence electrons
distributed between different kinds of orbitals, like s and p orbitals?
In order for VSEPR theory to make sense, it must be combined with another idea: hybridiza-
tion. Hybridization refers to the mixing of atomic orbitals into new, hybrid orbitals. Electron
pairs occupy equivalent hybrid orbitals. It’s important to realize that the hybrid orbitals are
all equivalent, because that helps you understand the shapes that emerge from the electron
pairs trying to distance themselves from one another. If electrons in a pure p orbital are
trying to distance themselves from electrons in another p orbital and from electrons in an s
orbital, the resulting shape may not be symmetrical because s orbitals are different from p
orbitals. But if all these electrons occupied identical hybrid orbitals (each orbital a little bit s
and a little bit p), then the resulting shape is more likely to be symmetrical.
Real molecules have all sorts of symmetrical shapes that just don’t make sense if electrons
truly occupy only “pure” orbitals (like s and p). The “mixing” of pure orbitals into hybrids
allows chemists to explain the symmetrical shapes of real molecules with VSEPR theory. This
kind of mixing must in some sense actually occur, as the case of methane, CH4, makes clear.
The shape of methane, confirmed by experiment, is tetrahedral. The four C-H bonds of
methane are of equal strength and are equidistant from each other. Now compare that
description with the electron configuration of carbon in Figure 5-12. Carbon contains a filled
1s orbital, but this is an inner-shell orbital, so it doesn’t impact the geometry of bonding.
However, the valence shell of carbon contains one filled 2s orbital, two half-filled 2p orbitals,
and one empty p orbital (see Chapter 4 for more about these orbitals). Not the picture of
equality. This configuration is inconsistent with the tetrahedral bonding geometry of carbon,
making clear that the valence orbitals must hybridize.

How can hydrogen atoms form four identical bonds with carbon? Conceptually, two things
happen to produce the four equivalent orbitals necessary for methane.
 First, one of carbon’s 2s electrons is “promoted” (sent to a higher-energy orbital) to the
empty 2p orbital. This promotion results in four half-filled valence orbitals; the 2s
orbital and three 2p orbitals now each contain one electron.
 Second, the single 2s orbital is mixed with the three 2p orbitals to create four identical
sp3 hybrid orbitals. The fact that each sp3 orbital is identical is important because
VSEPR theory can now explain the symmetrical shape of methane: the tetrahedron.
So, the shapes of real molecules emerge from the geometry of valence orbitals — the orbitals
that bond to other atoms. Here’s how to predict this geometry:
1. Count the number of lone pairs and bonding partners an atom actually has within a
molecule. You can do this by looking at the Lewis structure.
In formaldehyde (CH2O), for example, carbon bonds with two hydrogen atoms and
double bonds with one oxygen atom. So, carbon effectively has three valence orbitals.
2. Next, inspect the electron configuration, looking for the mixture of orbital types
(like s and p) that the valence electrons occupy.
Carbon has four valence electrons in 2s22p2 configuration. Two valence electrons
occupy an s orbital, and one electron occupies each of two identical p orbitals. The s
orbital isn’t equivalent to the p orbitals. So, we mix the s orbital with the two p orbitals
to create three identical sp2 hybrid orbitals.
Note that the total number of orbitals doesn’t change; in the example, formaldehyde has
three valence orbitals before mixing and still has three valence orbitals after mixing. VSEPR
theory predicts that electrons in three identical orbitals mutually repel to create a trigonal
planar geometry — the three orbitals splay out in a plane with 120 degrees between each
orbital. The shape of the formaldehyde molecule is trigonal planar.
Different combinations of orbitals produce different hybrids. One s orbital mixes with two p
orbitals to create three identical sp2 hybrids. One s orbital mixes with one p orbital to create
two identical sp hybrids. Centers with sp3, sp2, and sp hybridization tend to possess tetrahe-
dral, trigonal planar, and linear shapes, respectively.
Lewis structures provide a good starting place for roughly estimating the shapes of 
molecules.
 If a central atom has two bonding partners, the shape of the molecule around that
center will likely be fairly linear.
 If the central atom has three bonding partners, the shape will likely be close to trigonal
planar.
 If the central atom has four bonding partners, the shape will likely be close to 
tetrahedral.
The actual shapes may vary from these rough estimates depending on other factors, such 
as whether the central atom has lone pairs. For example, the oxygen atom of water has two
lone pairs in addition to two bonding orbitals. In all, then, the electrons in the orbitals sur-
rounding oxygen create a tetrahedral-like geometry. But, because only two hydrogen atoms
are actually bound, the shape of the molecule is “bent.”

Q.
Methane, CH4, has four hydrogen atoms
bonded to a central carbon atom.
Ammonia, NH3, has three hydrogen
atoms bonded to a central nitrogen
atom. Using VSEPR theory, compare and
contrast the orbital geometry and molecu-
lar shape of these two molecules.
A.
Carbon and nitrogen are both sp3
hybridized in methane and ammonia,
respectively. Carbon contributes a single
electron in each hybrid orbital to a cova-
lent bond, the second electron in each
bond coming from a hydrogen. Nitrogen
has one more valence electron than
carbon. Therefore, one of the hybrid
orbitals of nitrogen contains two elec-
trons and can’t receive a bonding elec-
tron from hydrogen. Although ammonia
has only three bonded hydrogen atoms
for this reason, the central nitrogen has 
a lone pair of electrons in the remaining
sp3 orbital. These electrons still repel
other electron pairs. So, the ammonia
molecule has a nearly tetrahedral orbital
geometry, similar to that of methane.
However, because one of the orbitals
contains a lone pair (not a bonded atom)
the molecular shape of ammonia is trigo-
nal pyramidal.

Two lithium atoms each transfer a single electron to one sulfur atom to yield the ionic com-

As a salt, magnesium chloride (MgCl2) is certainly an ionic compound. So, MgCl2 dissolves to a
greater extent in more polar solvents. Dissolved ions act as electrolytes, conducting electricity
in solutions. The more brightly glowing bulb in the circuit containing the aqueous (water-
based) solution suggests that more electrolytes are present in that solution. More salt dis-
solved in water than in rubbing alcohol because water is the more polar solvent.
d
Dichlorine is Cl2, a compound formed when one chlorine atom bonds to another. Because each
atom in the compound is of the same element, the two atoms have the same electronegativity.
So, the difference in electronegativity between the two atoms is 0. This means that the bond
between the two chlorine atoms must be covalent. The electron dot structure of dichlorine is
shown in the following figure:
e
A coordinate covalent bond forms between the aluminum and the hydrating water molecules.
Aluminum is a group IIIA element, so the aluminum (III) cation formally has no valence elec-

by donating lone pairs to form coordinate covalent bonds. In this respect, we can call the water
molecules ligands of the metal ion.

The molecular orbital diagram for dihelium is shown in the following figure. Each helium atom
contributes two electrons to the molecular orbitals for a total of four electrons. Each molecular
orbital holds two electrons, so both the low-energy bonding orbital and the high-energy anti-
bonding orbitals are filled.
h
The total energy change to make dihelium from two separate helium atoms is the sum of the
changes due to bonding and antibonding. Putting two electrons in the antibonding orbital costs
more energy than is saved by putting two electrons in the bonding orbital. So, going from two
separate helium atoms to one molecule of dihelium requires an input of energy. Reactions spon-
taneously go to lower energy, not higher energy, so dihelium is unlikely to exist under normal
conditions.
i
The reaction breaks one of the carbon-carbon bonds, replacing the double bond with two
single bonds. The carbon-carbon bond that breaks is the pi bond, because the pi electrons are
more accessible (above and below the axis of the bond) and because the pi bond is weaker
than the sigma bond. So, the weaker pi bond is replaced by a stronger sigma bond. In bonds,
weaker means higher energy, and stronger means lower energy. So, the reaction moves from
higher to lower energy, which is favorable.
j
The assignment of bond character depends on the difference in electronegativity between the
atoms:
a. The difference in electronegativity between H and Cl is 0.9, so the bond is a polar covalent
bond.
b. The difference in electronegativity between Ga and Ge is 0.2, so the bond is a nonpolar 
covalent bond.
c. The difference in electronegativity between O and O is 0.0, so the bond is a nonpolar 
covalent bond.
d. The difference in electronegativity between Na and Cl is 2.1, so the bond is an ionic bond.
e. The difference in electronegativity between C and O is 1.0, so the bond is a polar covalent
bond.

Both molecules contain polar covalent bonds. The C-F bonds of CF4 are slightly more polar than
the H-O bonds of water due to the greater difference in electronegativity between the former
pair of atoms (1.5 versus 1.4). However, water is a much more polar molecule due to molecular
shape. Because of its tetrahedral shape, the bond dipoles of CF4 cancel each other out entirely,
so the molecule as a whole is nonpolar. Because of its bent shape, the bond dipoles of water
only partially cancel, so the molecule as a whole is polar.

In CO2, carbon is sp hybridized. CO2 is linear, with the carbon double-bonded to each oxygen
so that four electrons are constrained in each of two bond axes. In CH2O, carbon is sp2
hybridized, so the molecule is trigonal planar. The four electrons of the double bond are con-
strained within one bond axis, and two electrons each are within bonds to hydrogen. In H3CBr,
carbon is sp3 hybridized, so the molecule is shaped like a tetrahedron, similar to the shape
of methane, CH4; each bond is separated from all the others by approximately 109 degrees.
Two electrons are constrained within each of four bonds.

The Lewis structures for the three molecules are shown in the following figure. The oxygen of
water is sp3 hybridized, with two single bonds and two lone pairs, resulting in a bent shape.
Each carbon of ethyne is sp hybridized, with six electrons devoted to a triple bond and two
devoted to a single bond with hydrogen, resulting in a linear shape. Carbon tetrachloride is sp3
hybridized, with all electron pairs involved in single bonds, resulting in a tetrahedral shape.
n
The hybridization of an atom’s valence orbitals determines that atom’s orbital geometry, but
doesn’t completely determine molecular shape. Shape depends on whether electrons in the
orbitals are involved in bonding or in lone pairs. Trigonal bipyramidal geometry suggests that
there are five valence orbitals: two along a central axis and three distributed evenly in a plane
perpendicular to that axis (it may help to refer back to Figure 5-10). In ClF3, Cl is the central
atom. Both orbitals along the central axis are involved in Cl-F bonds to fluorine atoms. Only one
of the orbitals in the perpendicular plane is involved in a bond to the remaining fluorine atom.
The other two orbitals contain lone pairs. The result is a T-shaped molecule.

hemists give compounds very specific names. Sometimes these names seem overly
specific. For example, what’s the point of referring to “dihydrogen monoxide” when
you can simply say “water”? First, you must try to understand that many chemists simply
believe this kind of thing sounds cool. Beyond dubious notions of coolness, however, 
there lies a more important reason: Chemical names clue you in to chemical structures. But
only if you know the code. Fortunately, the code, as you find out in this chapter, is pretty
straightforward — no advanced cryptology required. This is also fortunate, because putting
chemists and cryptologists in the same room could result in the kind of party you don’t
want to admit having attended.
Naming Ionic Compounds
Chapter 5 discusses the way that anions (atoms with negative charge) and cations (atoms
with positive charge) attract one another to form ionic bonds. Ionic compounds are held
together by ionic bonds. Fine, but how does the formula of an ionic compound relate to the
name of the compound?
Naming a simple ionic compound is easy. You pair the name of the cation with the name of
the anion, and then change the ending of the anion’s name to –ide. The cation always pre-
cedes the anion in the final name. For example, the chemical name of NaCl (a compound
made up of one sodium atom and one chlorine atom) is sodium chloride.
Of course, sodium chloride is more commonly known as table salt. Many compounds have
such so-called common names. There isn’t anything necessarily wrong with common names,
but they’re less informative than chemical names. The name “sodium chloride,” properly
decoded, tells you that you’re dealing with a one-to-one ionic compound composed of
sodium and chlorine.

Cations and anions combine in very predictable ways within ionic compounds, always acting
to neutralize overall charge. Because this is true, the name of an ionic compound implies
more than just the identity of the atoms that make it up. It also implies the ratio in which 
elements combine. Consider these two examples, both of which involve lithium:
 In the compound lithium fluoride (LiF), lithium and fluorine combine in a one-to-one
ratio because lithium’s +1 charge and fluorine’s –1 charge cancel one another (neutral-
ize) perfectly. By itself, the name lithium fluoride tells us only that the compound is
made up of a lithium cation and a fluoride anion, but by comparing their charges, 
you can see that Li+ and F– neutralize each other in the one-to-one compound, LiF.
 If lithium combines with oxygen to form an ionic compound, two lithium ions, each
with +1 charge, are required to neutralize the –2 charge of the oxide anion. So, the
name lithium oxide implies the formula Li2O, because a two-to-one ratio of lithium
cation to oxide anion is required to produce a neutral compound.
Use the name of the ionic compound to identify the ions you’re dealing with, and then com-
bine those ions in the simplest way that results in a neutral compound.
Using a compound’s name to identify the ions can be tricky when the cation is a metal. All
group B metals — with the exception of silver (which is always found as Ag+) and zinc
(always Zn2+) — as well as several group A elements on the right-hand side of the periodic
table can take on a variety of charges. Chemists use an additional naming device, the Roman
numeral, to identify the charge state of the cation. A Roman numeral placed within parenthe-
ses after the name of the cation gives the positive charge of that cation. For example, copper
(I) is copper with a +1 charge, and copper (II) is copper with a +2 charge. Is this kind of dis-
tinction simply chemical hair-splitting? Who cares whether you’re dealing with iron (II) bro-
mide, FeBr2, or iron (III) bromide, FeBr3? The difference matters because ionic compounds
with different formulas (even those containing the same types of elements) can have very 
different properties.
The trickiness of metals with variable charges also applies when you translate a chemical 
formula into the corresponding chemical name. Here are the two secrets to keep in mind:
 The name implies the charge of the ions which make up an ionic compound.
 The charges of the ions determine the ratio in which they combine.
Given the formula CrO, for example, you must do a little bit of sleuthing before assigning 
a name. From periodic table trends (which we cover in Chapter 4), you know that oxygen
brings a –2 charge to an ionic compound. Because O2– combines with chromium in a one-
to-one ratio within CrO, you know that chromium here must have the equal and opposite
charge of +2. In this way, CrO can be electrically neutral (uncharged). So, the chromium
cation in CrO is Cr2+, and the compound name is chromium (II) oxide. Simply calling the 
compound chromium oxide leaves open the question of the precise chromium cation in play.
For example, chromium can assume a +3 charge. When Cr3+ combines with oxide anion, a dif-
ferent ion ratio is necessary to produce a neutral compound: Cr2O3, or chromium (III) oxide.
This equating of total positive and negative charges in an atom is called balancing the charge.
After you have balanced the charges in the atom’s formula, you can drop the charges on the
individual ions.

What is the formula for the compound
tin (IV) fluoride?

SnF4. The Roman numeral within paren-

Sn4+. Because fluorine is a halogen, it
always has a charge of –1 in ionic com-
pounds, which means that four fluoride
anions are necessary to cancel the four
positive charges of a single tin cation.
Therefore, the compound is SnF4.

Dealing with Those Pesky Polyatomic Ions
A confession: We have shielded you thus far from a very disturbing fact about ions. Not all
ions are of single atoms. To continue your education in chemical nomenclature, you must
grapple with an irksome and all-too-common group of molecules called the polyatomic ions,

which are made up of groups of atoms. Polyatomic ions, like single-element ions, tend to
quickly combine with other ions to neutralize their charge. Unfortunately, you can’t use any
simple, periodic trend–type rules to figure out the charge of a polyatomic ion. You must —
gulp — memorize them. Truth.
Table 6-1 summarizes the most common polyatomic ions, grouping them by charge.

Notice in Table 6-1 that all the common polyatomic ions, except ammonium, have a negative
charge ranging between –1 and –3. Also take note of a number of –ite/–ate pairs. For example,
there are chlorite and chlorate, phosphite and phosphate, and nitrite and nitrate. If you look
closely at these pairs, you notice that the only difference between them is the number of
oxygen atoms in each ion. Specifically, the –ate ion always has one more oxygen atom than
the –ite ion, but has the same overall charge.
To complicate your life further, polyatomic ions sometimes occur multiple times within the
same ionic compound. How do you specify that your compound has two sulfate ions in a way
that makes visual sense? Put the entire polyatomic ion formula in parentheses, and then add
a subscript outside the parentheses to indicate how many such ions you have, as in (SO4
2–)2.
When you write a chemical formula that involves polyatomic ions, you treat them just like
other ions. You still need to balance charges to form a neutral atom. When converting from a
formula to a name, we are sorry to report that there is no simple rule for naming polyatomic
ions. You just have to memorize the entire table of polyatomic ions and their charges.
Challenge a chemist to a polyatomic ion duel, and you’ll find that she can rattle off the name,
formula, and charge of the polyatomic ions in the blink of an eye. By the time you’re done
with this book, you should be able to give her a run for her money.

Ba(ClO2)2. Barium is an alkaline earth metal
(group IIA) and thus has a charge of +2. You
should recognize chlorite as the name of a
polyatomic ion. In fact, any anion name
which does not end in an –ide should
scream polyatomic ion to you. As shown in
Table 6-1, chlorite is ClO2
–, which reveals
that the chlorite ion has a –1 charge, so two
chlorite ions are needed to neutralize the
+2 charge of a single barium cation, so the
chemical formula is Ba(ClO2)2.

Giving Monikers to Molecular Compounds
As described in Chapter 5, nonmetals tend to form covalent bonds with one another.
Compounds made up of nonmetals held together by one or more covalent bonds are called
molecular compounds. Predicting how the atoms within molecules will bond with one another
is a tricky endeavor because two nonmetals often can combine in multiple ratios. Carbon and
oxygen, for example, can combine in a one-to-two ratio to form CO2 (carbon dioxide), a harm-
less gas that you emit every time you exhale. Alternately, the same two elements can com-
bine in a one-to-one ratio to form CO (carbon monoxide), a poisonous gas. Clearly, it’s useful
to have names that distinguish between these and other molecular compounds. The punish-
ment for sloppy naming can be death. Or at least embarrassment.
Molecular compound names clearly specify how many of each type of atom participate in the
compound. The prefixes used to do so are listed in Table 6-2.

The prefixes in Table 6-2 can be attached to any of the elements in a molecular compound, 
as exemplified by SO3 (sulfur trioxide) or N2O (dinitrogen monoxide). The second element in
each compound receives the –ide suffix, as in ionic compounds (which we discuss earlier in
this chapter). In the case of molecular compounds, where cations or anions aren’t involved,
the more electronegative element (in other words, the element that’s closer to the upper
right-hand corner of the periodic table) tends to be named second.
Notice (with annoyance) that the absence of a prefix from the first named element of a
molecular compound implies that there is only one atom of that element. In other words, the
prefix mono– is unnecessary for the first element only. You still have to attach a mono– prefix,
when appropriate, to the names of subsequent elements.
Writing a formula for a molecular compound with a given name is much simpler than writing
a formula for an ionic compound. In a molecular compound, the ratio in which the two ele-
ments combine is built into the name itself, and you don’t need to worry about balancing
charges. For example, the prefixes in the name dihydrogen monoxide imply that the chemical
formula contains two hydrogens and one oxygen (H2O).
Translating a formula into a name is equally simple. All you need to do is convert the num-
bers into prefixes and attach them to the names of the elements that make up the compound.
For example, for the compound N2O4, you simply attach the prefix di– to nitrogen to indicate
the two nitrogen atoms, and tetra– to oxygen to indicate the four oxygen atoms, giving you
dinitrogen tetroxide.
Hydrogen is located on the far left of the periodic table, but it’s actually a nonmetal! In keep-
ing with this hydrogenic schizophrenia, hydrogen can appear as either the first or second
element in a binary (two-element) molecular compound, as shown by dihydrogen monosul-
fide (H2S) and phosphorus trihydride, PH3.

Q.
What are the names of the compounds
N2O, SF6, and Cl2O8?
A.
Dinitrogen monoxide, sulfur hexafluo-
ride, and dichlorine octoxide. Notice
that none of these compounds contain
any metals, which means that they are
most certainly molecular compounds.
The first compound contains two 
nitrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, 
so it’s called dinitrogen monoxide. The
second compound contains one sulfur
and six fluorines. Because sulfur is the
first named element, we needn’t include
a mono– prefix. So, we name the com-
pound simply sulfur hexafluoride
(instead of monosulfur hexafluoride).
Using the same methods, the third com-
pound is named dichlorine octoxide.

Seeing the Forest: A Unified Scheme 
for Naming Compounds
Have all the naming rules in the previous sections left you confused and frustrated? Do you feel
like rebelling against the fascist chemical conspiracy, and liberating all chemicals from the
oppressive confines of their formal names? All right, calm down. If you take a step back to look
at the big picture, you see that the naming system is actually pretty logical and straightforward.
You can best see the logical structure by envisioning the naming process as a flowchart, a
series of questions whose answers lead down a path toward a compound’s name. For any
binary (two-part) compound XY, use the following four questions to guide yourself to a name.
1. Is X hydrogen?
Compounds which contain a hydrogen cation are commonly called acids, and many of
them have common names. Although it is perfectly acceptable to call the compound
HCl “hydrogen monochloride,” it’s more commonly referred to as “hydrochloric acid.”
As with the polyatomic ions that we cover earlier in this chapter, you’ll be happier in
the end if you simply memorize the common acids listed in Table 6-3.

b. Nitrogen trifluoride
c. Disulfur decafluoride
d. Diphosphorus trichloride

2. Is X a nonmetal or a metal?
If X is a nonmetal, you need to use prefixes when naming both it and its partner, Y,
because the compound is molecular. If X is a metal, then you’re dealing with an ionic
compound — proceed to Step 3.
3. Is X a group B metal?
If X is a group B metal (or other metal of variable charge, like tin), you need to use
Roman numerals to specify its charge.
4. Is Y a polyatomic ion?
If Y is a polyatomic ion, you have to recognize it as such and have its name memorized
(or easily accessible in a nifty table such as Table 6-1). If Y is a simple anion, then you
use an –ide ending.
Visualize this series of questions with the help of Figure 6-1.
You can use the flowchart in Figure 6-1 in reverse to help you figure out a chemical formula
from the name of a compound. If the compound name contains a Roman numeral (III, for
example), you know the charge of the metal in that compound (3+ in this case). If X is a non-
metal, you know you’re dealing with a molecular compound, and you can start examining the
name for prefixes that tell you how many atoms of each element there are. If you find no such
prefixes, check to see whether X is hydrogen — if so, you’re dealing with an acid.

Q.
Name the compound Sn(OH)2.
A.
Tin (II) hydroxide. Sn is not hydrogen or
a nonmetal, so you know that the com-
pound is neither an acid nor a molecular
compound. This means you’re dealing
with an ionic compound. Sn is, however,
one of the group A elements that takes
on varying charge, so you should be pre-
pared to do some sleuthing to determine
what exactly its charge is. The only
remaining question is whether we have 
a polyatomic anion or an ordinary one.
The fact that OH contains more than one
atom should scream polyatomic ion to
you. Consulting Table 6-1, you find that
OH (hydroxide) has a charge of –1. If two
hydroxide ions (each with a charge of –1)
are needed to cancel out the positive
charge of the tin, then you must be deal-
ing with Sn2+. The name of the compound
is therefore tin (II) hydroxide.

Answers to Questions on Naming Compounds
You survived all the practice questions on naming compounds. Now enjoy the process
of seeing how spot-on correct your answers were.
a
These are all ordinary ionic compounds, so you simply need to pair the cation name with the
anion name and change the anion name’s ending to –ide.
a. Magnesium fluoride
b. Lithium bromide
c. Cesium oxide
d. Calcium sulfide
b
As the problem states, all the cations here are ones that can have varying amounts of positive
charge, so you need to decipher their charges.
a. Iron (II) fluoride. The fluoride ion has a charge of –1. Because there are two fluorides here,
the single iron ion must have a +2 charge.
b. Mercury (I) bromide. The –1 charge of the bromide must be balanced by a +1 charge.
c. Tin (IV) iodide. The four iodide anions each have a –1 charge. This means that the tin cation
must have a charge of +4.
d. Manganese (III) oxide. There are three oxide anions here, each with a charge of –2, giving an
overall negative charge of –6. The manganese cations must carry a total of +6 charge, split
between the two cations, so we must be dealing with Mn3+.
c
The names translate into the following chemical formulas:
a. Fe2O3. Because the name specifies that you’re dealing with Fe3+, and because oxygen is always
O2–, you simply balance your charges to yield Fe2O3.
b. BeCl2. Beryllium is an alkaline earth metal with a charge of +2, while chlorine is a halogen
with a charge of –1.
c. SnS. Because the name specifies that you are dealing with Sn2+, and because sulfur is always
S2–, you simply balance your charges to yield SnS.
d. KI. Potassium is an alkali metal with a charge of +1, while iodine is a halogen with a charge of –1.
d
Look up (or recall) the polyatomic ions in each compound, and specify the charge of the cation
if it’s a metal that can take on different charges.
a. Magnesium phosphate. Magnesium is the cation here, and the anion is PO4. Table 6-1 tells you
that this is the polyatomic ion phosphate (not to be confused with phosphite, or PO3).
b. Lead (II) acetate. Acetate has a –1 charge, and because two of them are needed to balance out
the charge on the lead cation, you must be dealing with Pb2+.
c. Chromium (III) nitrite. Nitrite has a –1 charge, and because three of them are needed to bal-
ance out the charge on the chromium cation, you must be dealing with Cr3+.
94
Part II: Making and Remaking Compounds 

d. Ammonium oxalate. Here, both the cation and the anion are polyatomic ions. Annoying but
true.
e. Potassium permaganate. Potassium is the cation here, so all you need to do is look up the
anion MnO4 to find that it’s called permaganate.
e
First look up (or better, recall from memory) the charge of the polyatomic ion or ions, and then
use subscripts as necessary to balance charges.
a. K2SO4
b. PbCr2O7
c. NH4Cl
d. NaOH
e. Cr2(CO2)3
f
Translate the subscripts into prefixes using Table 6-2. Omit the prefix mono– on the first named
element in a compound, where applicable.
a. Dinitrogen tetrahydride
b. Dihydrogen monosulfide
c. Nitrogen monoxide
d. Carbon tetrabromide
g
Translate the prefixes into subscripts using Table 6-2. If the first named element lacks a prefix,
assume that there is only one such atom per molecule.
a. SiF2
b. NF3
c. S2F10
d. P2Cl3
h
Use the flowchart in Figure 6-1 to guide yourself to a name.
a. Lead (II) chromate. Lead is a group B element, and CrO4
2– is a polyatomic ion. Therefore, you
need to determine the charge on the lead and specify that charge with a Roman numeral. If
you haven’t memorized it, find CrO4
2– in Table 6-1. Because chromate combines with lead in a
one-to-one ratio, you know that the charge on the lead must be +2.
b. Magnesium phosphide. This is a simple ionic compound, because Mg is a non-group B metal,
and because P is not a polyatomic ion.
c. Strontium silicate. Sr is neither a group B element nor a nonmetal, but SiO3 forms a poly-
atomic ion.
d. Sulfuric acid (common name) or dihydrogen sulfate (systematic name). In addition, this
compound is sometimes referred to simply as hydrogen sulfate because the –2 charge on sul-
fate implies that two hydrogen cations are necessary to neutralize charge. The cation here is
hydrogen, so you’re dealing with an acid. Common names of acids are listed in Table 6-3. You
can also name the compound properly by recognizing the polyatomic ion, sulfate.
95
Chapter 6: Naming Compounds

e. Sodium sulfide. Simply name the cation and change the ending of the (polyatomic) anion to –ide.
f. Triboron diselenide. Both boron and selenium are nonmetals, so this is a molecular com-
pound. Therefore, it must be named using prefixes.
g. Mercury (II) fluoride. Here you have an ionic compound with a group B metal, necessitating
the use of a Roman numeral. The charge on the mercury atom must be +2 because it com-
bines with two fluoride anions, each of which must have a –1 charge.
h. Barium phosphate. This is an ionic compound which contains a polyatomic ion, phosphate.
i
Reverse your naming rules to deduce the chemical formula of each compound.
a. Ba(OH)2. Barium is an ordinary metal, while hydroxide is a polyatomic ion with a charge of –1.
b. SnBr4. The name indicates that you are dealing with Sn4+, and the fluoride ion has a charge 
of –1, so you need four of them to balance the charge of a single tin cation.
c. Na2SO4. Sodium is a simple alkali metal, while sulfate is a polyatomic ion with a charge of –2.
d. PI3. The prefixes indicate that this is a molecular compound containing a single phosphorus
atom and three iodine atoms.
e. Mg(MnO4)2. Magnesium is a metal, while permanganate is a polyatomic ion with a charge 
of –1.
f. H4C2O2. Use Table 6-3 to translate this common acid into its chemical formula.
g. NH2. The di– prefix and the fact that both elements are nonmetals indicate that this is a
molecular compound. Nitrogen, the first named element, lacks a prefix, so there must be only
one nitrogen per molecule. The di– prefix indicates two hydrogen atoms per molecule.
h. FeCrO4. The name tells you that you’re dealing with Fe2+ and the polyatomic ion chromate,
which has a charge of –2. A one-to-one ratio is sufficient to neutralize overall charge.

hemists routinely deal with hunks of material containing trillions of trillions of atoms,
but ridiculously large numbers can induce migraines. For this reason, chemists count
particles (like atoms and molecules) in multiples of a quantity called the mole. Initially,
counting particles in moles can be counterintuitive, similar to the weirdness of Dustin
Hoffman’s character in the movie Rainman, when he informs Tom Cruise’s character that he
has spilled 0.41 fraction of a box of 200 toothpicks onto the floor. Instead of referring to 82
individual toothpick particles, he refers to a fraction of a larger unit, the 200-toothpick box.
A mole is a very big box of toothpicks — 6.022 × 1023 toothpicks, to be precise. In this chap-
ter, we explain what you need to know about moles.
Counting Your Particles: The Mole
If 6.022 × 1023 strikes you as an unfathomably large number, then you’re thinking about it 
correctly. It’s larger, in fact, than the number of stars in the sky or the number of fish in the
sea, and is many, many times more than the number of people who have ever been born
throughout all of human history. When you think about the number of particles in something
as simple as, say, a cup of water, all your previous conceptions of “big numbers” are blown
out of the water, as it were.
The number 6.022 × 1023, known as Avogadro’s number, is named after the 19th century Italian
scientist Amedeo Avogadro. Posthumously, Avogadro really pulled one off in giving his name
to this number, because he never actually thought of it. The real brain behind Avogadro’s
number was that of a French scientist named Jean Baptiste Perrin. Nearly 100 years after
Avogadro had his final pasta, Perrin named the number after him as an homage. Ironically,
this humble act of tribute has misdirected the resentment of countless hordes of high school
chemistry students to Avogadro instead of Perrin.
Avogadro’s number is the conversion factor used to move between particle counts and num-
bers of moles:

Like all conversion factors, you can invert it to move in the other direction, from moles to
particles. (Flip to Chapter 2 for an introduction to conversion factors.)

Q.
How many water molecules are in one tablespoon of water, if the tablespoon holds 0.82

Assigning Mass and Volume to Moles
Chemists always begin a discussion about moles with Avogadro’s number. They do this for
two reasons. First, it makes sense to start the discussion with the way the mole was origi-
nally defined. Second, it’s a sufficiently large number to intimidate the unworthy.
Still, for all its primacy and intimidating size, Avogadro’s number quickly grows tedious in
everyday use. More interesting is the fact that one mole of a pure monatomic substance (in
other words, a substance that always appears as a single atom) turns out to possess exactly
its atomic mass’s worth of grams. In other words, one mole of monatomic hydrogen weighs
about 1 gram. One mole of monatomic helium weighs about 4 grams. The same is true no
matter where you wander through the corridors of the periodic table. The number listed as
the atomic mass of an element equals that element’s molar mass if the element is monatomic.
Of course, chemistry involves the making and breaking of bonds (as you find out in Chapter 5),
so talk of pure monatomic substances gets you only so far. How lucky, then, that calculating the
mass per mole of a complex molecule is essentially no different than finding the mass per mole
of a monatomic element. For example, one molecule of glucose (C6H12O6) is assembled from 6
carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms. To calculate the number of grams per
mole of a complex molecule (such as glucose), simply do the following:
1. Multiply the number of atoms per mole of the first element by its atomic mass.
In this case, the first element is carbon, and you’d multiply its atomic mass, 12, by the
number of atoms, 6.
2. Multiply the number of atoms per mole of the second element by its atomic mass.
Here, you multiply hydrogen’s atomic mass of 1 by the number of hydrogen atoms, 12.
3. Multiply the number of atoms per mole of the third element by its atomic mass.
Keep going until you’ve covered all the elements in the molecule.
The third element in glucose is oxygen, so you multiply 16, the atomic mass, by 6, the
number of oxygen atoms.
4. Finally, add the masses together.
In this example, (12g mol–1 × 6) + (1g mol–1 × 12) + (16g mol–1 × 6) = 180g mol–1.
This kind of quantity, called the gram molecular mass, is exceptionally convenient for
chemists, who are much more inclined to measure the mass of a substance than to count all
of the millions or billions of individual particles that make it up.
If chemists don’t try to intimidate you with large numbers, they may attempt to do so by
throwing around big words. For example, chemists may distinguish between the molar
masses of pure elements, molecular compounds, and ionic compounds by referring to them
as the gram atomic mass, gram molecular mass, and gram formula mass, respectively. Don’t be
fooled! The basic concept behind each is the same: molar mass.
It’s all very good to find the mass of a solid or liquid and then go about calculating the
number of moles in that sample. But what about gases? Let’s not engage in phase discrimina-
tion; gases are made of matter, too, and their moles have the right to stand and be counted.
Fortunately, there’s a convenient way to convert between the moles of gaseous particles and
their volume. Unlike gram atomic/molecular/formula masses, this conversion factor is con-
stant no matter what kinds of molecules make up the gas. Every gas has a volume of 22.4 liters
per mole, regardless of the size of the gaseous molecules.
99
Chapter 7: Managing the Mighty Mole

Before you start your hooray-chemistry-is-finally-getting-simple dance, however, understand
that certain conditions apply to this conversion factor. For example, it’s only true at standard
temperature and pressure (STP), or 0° Celsius and 1 atm. Also, the figure of 22.4L mol–1 applies
only to the extent that a gas resembles an ideal gas, one whose particles have zero volume
and neither attract nor repel one another. Ultimately, no gas is truly ideal, but many are so
close to being so that the 22.4L mol–1 conversion is very useful.
What if you want to convert between the volume of a gaseous substance and its mass, or the
mass of a substance and the number of particles it contains? You already have all the infor-
mation you need! To make these kinds of conversions, simply build a chain of conversion fac-
tors, converting units step by step from the ones you have (say, liters) to the ones you want
(say, grams). You’ll find that your chain of conversion factors always includes central links
featuring units of moles. You can think of the mole as a family member who passes on what
you’ve said, loudly barking into the ear of your nearly deaf grandmother, because you have
laryngitis and can’t speak any louder. Without such a central translator, your message would
no doubt be misinterpreted. “Grandma, how was your day?” would be received as “Grandma,
you want to eat clay?” So, unless you’re bent on force-feeding clay to your grandmother, do
not attempt to convert directly from volume to mass, from mass to particles, or any other
such shortcut. Use your translator, the mole.

Q.
On her last day of work before retirement, Dr. Dentura daydreams about her newly pur-
chased condo in Florida. Distracted, Dr. Dentura forgets to turn off the dinitrogen monoxide
(laughing gas) after administering it to a root canal patient. The gas flows, filling 10 percent
of the room, until her dental hygienist notices the hissing and nonchalantly turns off the
gas. Being denser than air, the laughing gas settles near the floor so the dentist doesn’t
notice. How many moles of dinitrogen monoxide escaped into the room? Assume that Dr.
Dentura suffers from frequent hot flashes and therefore keeps her office at a chilly 0°C.
Further assume that her exam room is a spacious 10-x-10-x-10-foot cube.
A.
126 mol. The problem tells you that the exam room is at standard temperature, and
because the good doctor is presumably operating somewhere on the surface of the earth,
it’s safe to assume that the local pressure is somewhere around 1 atm. Having assured your-
self that the room is at STP, you can safely use the 22.4L mol–1 conversion factor. To use it
effectively, you must convert the volume of the room into liters. You know that the room
has a volume of 10 ft × 10 ft × 10 ft = 1,000 ft3. You also know that the dinitrogen oxide gas
fills 10 percent of the room, and so accounts for 100 ft3. Convert from cubic feet to liters,
referring if you like to Chapter 2 for the conversion factor:
Then convert this volume in liters to moles by using the STP conversion factor of 22.4L mol–1:

Giving Credit Where It’s Due: 
Percent Composition
Chemists often are concerned with precisely what percentage of a compound’s mass con-
sists of one particular element. Lying awake at night, uttering prayers to Avogadro, they fret
over this quantity, called percent composition. Calculating percent composition is trickier
than you may think. Consider the following problem, for example.
The human body is composed of 60 to 70 percent water, and water contains twice as many
hydrogen atoms as oxygen atoms. If two-thirds of every water molecule is hydrogen and
water makes up 60 percent of the body, it seems logical to conclude that hydrogen makes up
40 percent of the body. Yet hydrogen is only the third most abundant element in the body by
mass. What gives?
Oxygen is 16 times more massive than hydrogen. So, equating atoms of hydrogen and atoms
of oxygen is a bit like equating a toddler to a sumo wrestler. When the doors of the elevator
won’t close, the sumo wrestler is the first one you should kick out, weep though he may.
Within a compound, it’s important to sort out the atomic toddlers from the atomic sumo
wrestlers. To do so, follow three simple steps.
1. Calculate the gram molecular mass or gram formula mass of the compound, as we
explain in the previous section. 
Percent compositions are completely irrelevant to gram atomic masses, because these
apply only to pure monatomic substances; by definition, these substance have 100 per-
cent composition of a given element.
2. Multiply the atomic mass of each element present in the compound by the number
of atoms of that element present in one molecule.
3. Divide each of the masses calculated in Step 2 by the total mass calculated in Step 1.
Multiply each fractional quotient by 100%. Voilà! You have the percent composition
by mass of each element in the compound.
102
Part II: Making and Remaking Compounds 
Q.
Calculate the percent composition for each element present in sodium sulfate, Na2SO4.
A.
Na: 32.4%, S: 22.5%, O: 45.1%. The gram formula mass of sodium sulfate is
(2 × 23.0g mol–1) + (1 × 32.0g mol–1) + (4 × 16.0g mol–1) = 142g mol–1.
Of each mole of compound,
2 × 23.0g = 46.0g are sodium
1 × 32.0g = 32.0g are sulfur
4 × 16.0g = 64.0g are oxygen
Dividing each of these quantities by the molar mass of sodium sulfate (142g) yields the 
percent composition:
As a check, add the three percentages to ensure they equal 100%: 32.4% + 22.5% + 45.1% = 100%.

Moving from Percent Composition 
to Empirical Formulas
What if you don’t know the formula of a compound? Chemists sometimes find themselves in
this disconcerting scenario. Rather than curse Avogadro (or perhaps after doing so), they
analyze samples of the frustrating unknown to identify the percent composition. From there,
they calculate the ratios of different types of atoms in the compound. They express these
ratios as an empirical formula, the lowest whole number ratio of elements in a compound.
To find an empirical formula given percent composition, use the following procedure:
1. Assume that you have 100g of the unknown compound.
The beauty of this little trick is that you conveniently gift yourself with the same number
of grams of each elemental component as its contribution to the percent composition. For
example, if you assume that you have 100g of a compound composed of 60.3% magnesium
and 39.7% oxygen, you know that you have 60.3g of magnesium and 39.7g of oxygen.
2. Convert the assumed masses from Step 1 into moles by using gram atomic masses.
3. Divide each of the element-by-element mole quantities from Step 2 by the lowest
among them.
This division yields the mole ratios of the elements of the compound.
4. If any of your mole ratios aren’t whole numbers, multiply all numbers by the small-
est possible factor that produces whole number mole ratios for all the elements.
For example, if there is 1 nitrogen atom for every 0.5 oxygen atom in a compound,
the empirical formula is not N1O0.5. Such a formula casually suggests that an oxygen
atom has been split, something that would create a small-scale nuclear explosion.
Though impressive sounding, this scenario is almost certainly false. Far more likely is
that the atoms of nitrogen to oxygen are combining in a 1:0.5 ratio, but do so in groups
of 2 × (1:0.5) = 2:1. The empirical formula is thus N2O.
Because the original percent composition data is typically experimental, expect to see a
bit of error in the numbers. For example, 2.03 is probably within experimental error of 2.
5. Write the empirical formula by attaching these whole-number mole ratios as sub-
scripts to the chemical symbol of each element. Order the elements according to the
general rules for naming ionic and molecular compounds (described in Chapter 6).

Q.
What is the empirical formula of a substance that is 40.0% carbon, 6.7% hydrogen, and
53.3% oxygen, by mass?
A.
CH2O. For the sake of simplicity, assume that you have a total of 100g of this mystery com-
pound. Therefore, you have 40.0g of carbon, 6.7g of hydrogen, and 53.3g of oxygen. Convert
each of these masses to moles by using the gram atomic masses of C, H, and O.
Notice that the carbon and oxygen mole numbers are the same, so you know the ratio of
these two elements is 1:1 within the compound. Next, divide all the mole numbers by the
smallest among them, which is 3.33. This division yields
The compound has the empirical formula CH2O. The actual number of atoms within each
particle of the compound is some multiple of the numbers expressed in this formula.

Moving from Empirical Formulas 
to Molecular Formulas
Many compounds in nature, particularly compounds made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen,
are composed of atoms that occur in numbers that are multiples of their empirical formula.
In other words, their empirical formulas don’t reflect the actual numbers of atoms within
them, but only the ratios of those atoms. What a nuisance! Fortunately, this is an old nui-
sance, so chemists have devised a means to deal with it. To account for these annoying types
of compounds, chemists are careful to differentiate between an empirical formula and a
molecular formula. A molecular formula uses subscripts that report the actual number of
atoms of each type in a molecule of the compound (a formula unit accomplishes the same
thing for ionic compounds).
Molecular formulas are associated with gram molecular masses that are simple whole
number multiples of the corresponding empirical formula mass. In other words, a molecule
with the empirical formula CH2O has an empirical formula mass of 30.0g mol–1 (12 for the
carbon + 2 for the two hydrogens + 16 for the oxygen). The molecule may have a molecular
formula of CH2O, C2H4O2, C3H6O3, and so on. As a result, the compound may have a gram
molecular mass of 30.0g mol–1, 60.0g mol–1, 90.0g mol–1, and so on.
You can’t calculate a molecular formula based on percent composition alone. If you attempt
to do so, Avogadro and Perrin will rise from their graves, find you, and slap you 6.022 × 1023
times per cheek (Ooh, that smarts!). The folly of such an approach is made clear by compar-
ing formaldehyde with glucose. The two compounds have the same empirical formula, CH2O,
but different molecular formulas, CH2O and C6H12O6, respectively. Glucose is a simple sugar,
the one made by photosynthesis and the one broken down during cellular respiration. You
can dissolve it into your coffee with pleasant results. Formaldehyde is a carcinogenic compo-
nent of smog. Solutions of formaldehyde have historically been used to embalm dead bodies.
You are not advised to dissolve formaldehyde into your coffee. In other words, molecular for-
mulas differ from empirical formulas, and the difference is important.
To determine a molecular formula, you must know the gram formula mass of the compound
as well as the empirical formula (or enough information to calculate it yourself from the per-
cent composition; see the previous section for details). With these tools in hand, calculating
the molecular formula involves a three-step process:
1. Calculate the empirical formula mass.
2. Divide the gram molecular mass by the empirical formula mass.
3. Multiply each of the subscripts within the empirical formula by the number calcu-
lated in Step 2.

K: 40.3%; Cr: 26.8%; O: 33.0%. First, calculate the gram molecular mass of potassium chro-

(2 × 39.1g mol–1) + (1 × 52.0g mol–1) + (4 × 16.0g mol–1) = 194.2g mol–1
In a 100g sample, 78.2g are potassium, 52.0g are chromium, and 64.0g are oxygen. Divide each of
these masses by the gram molecular mass, and multiply by 100 to get the percent composition.
Note: If you’ve rounded your percentages properly, they don’t quite add to 100%, but rather
100.1%. If you had done away with rounding, you would have gotten exactly 100%. Rounding is
common practice though, so don’t be too worried if your answer is off by a tenth or two.

C: 81.8%; H: 18.2%. The molecular mass of propane is

formula by this number to obtain Na2O2. You’ve just found the molecular formula for sodium
peroxide.
m
C4H5N2O is the empirical formula; C8H10N4O2 is the molecular formula. You’re not directly given
the empirical formula of this compound. But you are given the percent composition. Using the
percent composition, you can calculate the empirical formula. To do this, assume that you have
100g of the substance, giving you 49.5g carbon, 5.2g hydrogen, 16.5g oxygen, and 28.8g nitro-
gen. Then divide these masses by the atomic mass of each element, giving you
49.5 / 12.0 = 4.125 mol carbon
5.2 / 1.0g = 5.2 mol hydrogen
16.5 / 16.0 = 1.031 mol oxygen
28.8 / 14.0 = 2.057 mol nitrogen
Finally, divide each of these mole values by the lowest among them, 1.031, giving you 4.0 mol
carbon, 5.0 mol hydrogen, 1.0 mol oxygen, and 2.0 mol nitrogen, giving you the empirical for-
mula C4H5N2O.
Here’s how you get the molecular formula: The empirical formula mass is 97.1g mol–1 (calcu-
lated by multiplying the number of atoms of each element in the compound by its atomic mass
and adding them all up). Dividing the gram molecular mass you were given (194.2g mol–1) by
this empirical formula mass yields the quotient, 2. Multiplying each of the subscripts in the
empirical formula by 2 produces the molecular formula, C8H10N4O2. The common name for this
culturally important compound is caffeine.

hapters 5, 6, and 7 focus on chemical compounds and the bonds that bind them. You
can think of a compound in two different ways:
 As the product of one chemical reaction
 As a starting material in another chemical reaction
In the end, chemistry is about action — about the breaking and making of bonds. Chemists
describe action by using chemical equations, sentences that say who reacted with whom, and
who remained when the smoke cleared. This chapter explains how to read, write, balance,
and predict the products of these action-packed chemical sentences.
Translating Chemistry into 
Equations and Symbols
In general, all chemical equations are written in the basic form
Reactants →Products
where the arrow in the middle means yields. The basic idea is that the reactants react, and
the reaction produces products. By reacting, we simply mean that bonds within the reactants
are broken, to be replaced by new and different bonds within the products.
Chemists fill chemical equations with symbols because they think it looks cool and, more
importantly, because the symbols help pack a lot of meaning into a small space. Table 8-1
summarizes the most important symbols you’ll find in chemical equations.

Table 8-1
Symbols Commonly Used in Chemical Equations
Symbol
Explanation
+
Separates two reactants or products.
→
The “yields” symbol separates the reactants from the products. The single arrowhead
suggests the reaction occurs in only one direction.
↔
A two-way yields symbol means the reaction can occur reversibly, in both directions.
You may also see this symbol written as two stacked arrows with opposing arrowheads.
(s)
A reactant or product followed by this symbol exists as a solid.
(l)
A reactant or product followed by this symbol exists as a liquid.
(g)
A reactant or product followed by this symbol exists as a gas.
(aq)
A reactant or product followed by this symbol exists in aqueous solution, dissolved in
water.
∆
This symbol, usually written above the yields symbol, signifies that heat is added to the
reactants.
Ni, LiCl
Sometimes a chemical symbol (such as those for nickel or lithium chloride here) is writ-
ten above the yields symbol. This means that the indicated chemical was added as a
catalyst. Catalysts speed up reactions but do not otherwise participate in them.
After you understand how to interpret chemical symbols, compound names (see Chapter 6),
and the symbols in Table 8-1, there’s not a lot you can’t understand. You’re equipped, for
example, to decode a chemical equation into an English sentence describing a reaction.
Conversely, you can translate an English sentence into the chemical equation it describes.
When you’re fluent in this language, you regrettably won’t be able to talk to the animals; you
will, however, be able to describe their metabolism in great detail.

Making Your Chemical Equations 
True by Balancing
The equations you read and wrote in the previous section are skeleton equations, and are per-
fectly adequate for a qualitative description of the reaction: who are the reactants and who
are the products. But if you look closely, you’ll see that those equations just don’t add up
quantitatively. As written, the mass of one mole of each of the reactants doesn’t equal the
mass of one mole of each of the products (see Chapter 7 for details on moles). The skeleton
equations break the Law of Conservation of Mass, which states that all the mass present at
the beginning of a reaction must be present at the end. To be quantitatively accurate, these
equations must be balanced so the masses of reactants and products are equal.
To balance an equation, you use coefficients to alter the number of moles of reactants and/or
products so the mass on one side of the equation equals the mass on the other side. A coeffi-
cient is simply a number that precedes the symbol of an element or compound, multiplying
the number of moles of that entire compound within the equation. Coefficients are different
from subscripts, which multiply the number of atoms or groups within a compound. Consider
the following:
4Cu(NO3)2

The number 4 that precedes the compound is a coefficient, indicating that there are four
moles of copper (II) nitrate. The subscripted 3 and 2 within the compound indicate that each
nitrate contains three oxygen atoms, and that there are two nitrate groups per atom of
copper. Coefficients and subscripts multiply to yield the total number of moles of each atom:
4 mol Cu(NO3)2 × (1 mol Cu/mol Cu(NO3)2) = 4 mol Cu
4 mol Cu(NO3)2 × (2 mol NO3/mol Cu(NO3)2) × 1 mol N/mol NO3 = 8 mol N
4 mol Cu(NO3)2 × (2 mol NO3/mol Cu(NO3)2) × 3 mol O/mol NO3 = 24 mol O
When you balance an equation, you change only the coefficients. Changing subscripts alters
the chemical compounds themselves. If your pencil were equipped with an electrical shock-
ing device, that device would activate the moment you attempted to change a subscript
while balancing an equation.
Here’s a simple recipe for balancing equations:
1. Given a skeleton equation (one that includes formulas for reactants and products),
count up the number of each kind of atom on each side of the equation.
If you recognize any polyatomic ions, you can count these as one whole group (as if
they were their own form of element). See Chapter 6 for information on recognizing
polyatomic ions.
2. Use coefficients to balance the elements or polyatomic ions, one at a time.
For simplicity, start with those elements or ions that appear only once on each side.
3. Check the equation to ensure that each element or ion is balanced.
Checking is important because you may have “ping-ponged” several times from reac-
tants to products and back — there’s plenty of opportunity for error.
4. When you’re sure the reaction is balanced, check to make sure it’s in lowest terms.
For example,
4H2(g) + 2O2(g) →4H2O(l)
should be reduced to
2H2(g) + O2(g) →2H2O(l)

Recognizing Reactions and Predicting Products
You can’t begin to wrap your brain around the unimaginably large number of possible chemi-
cal reactions. That’s good that so many reactions can occur, because they make things like
life and the universe possible. From the perspective of a mere human brain trying to grok all
these reactions, we have another bit of good news: A few categories of reactions pop up over
and over again. After you see the very basic patterns in these categories, you’ll be able to
make sense of the majority of reactions out there.
The following sections describe five types of reactions that you’d do well to recognize
(notice how their names tell you what happens in each reaction). By recognizing the patterns
of these five types of reactions, you can often predict reaction products given only a set of
reactants. There are no perfect guidelines, and predicting reaction products can take what is
called chemical intuition, a sense of what reaction is likely to occur based on knowing the 
outcomes of similar reactions. Still, if you’re given both reactants and products, you should
be able to tell what kind of reaction connects them, and if you’re given reactants and the type
of reaction, you should be able to predict likely products. Figuring out the formulas of prod-
ucts often requires you to apply knowledge about how ionic and molecular compounds are
put together. To review these concepts, see Chapters 5 and 6.
Combination
Two or more reactants combine to form a single product, following the general pattern
A + B →C
For example,
2Na(s) + Cl2(g) →2NaCl(s)
The combining of elements to form compounds (like NaCl) is a particularly common kind of
combination reaction. Here is another example:
2Ca(s) + O2(g) →2CaO(s)
Compounds can also combine to form new compounds, such as in the combination of
sodium oxide with water to form sodium hydroxide:
Na2O(s) + H2O(l) →2NaOH(aq)
Decomposition
A single reactant breaks down (decomposes) into two or more products, following the gen-
eral pattern
A →B + C
For example,
2H2O(l) →2H2(g) + O2(g)
116
Part II: Making and Remaking Compounds 

Notice that combination and decomposition reactions are the same reaction in opposite
directions.
Many decomposition reactions produce gaseous products, such as in the decomposition of
carbonic acid into water and carbon dioxide:
H2CO3(aq) →H2O(l) + CO2(g)
Single replacement
In a single replacement reaction, a single, more reactive element or group replaces a less
reactive element or group, following the general pattern
A + BC →AC + B
For example,
Zn(s) + CuSO4(aq) →ZnSO4(aq) + Cu(s)
Single replacement reactions in which metals replace other metals are especially common.
You can determine which metals are likely to replace which others by using the metal activity
series, a ranked list of metals in which ones higher on the list tend to replace ones lower on
the list. Table 8-2 presents the metal activity series.

Double replacement
Double replacement is a special form of metathesis reaction (that is, a reaction in which two
reacting species exchange bonds). Double replacement reactions tend to occur between
ionic compounds in solution. In these reactions, cations (atoms or groups with positive
charge) from each reactant swap places to form ionic compounds with the opposing anions
(atoms or groups with negative charge), following the general pattern
AB + CD →AD + CB
For example,
KCl(aq) + AgNO3(aq) →AgCl(s) + KNO3(aq)
Of course, ions dissolved in solution move about freely, not as part of cation-anion complexes.
So, to allow double replacement reactions to progress, one of several things must occur.
 One of the product compounds must be insoluble, so it precipitates (forms an insoluble
solid) out of solution after it forms.
 One of the products must be a gas that bubbles out of solution after it forms.
 One of the products must be a solvent molecule, such as H2O, that separates from the
ionic compounds after it forms.
Combustion
Oxygen is always a reactant in combustion reactions, which often release heat and light as
they occur. Combustion reactions frequently involve hydrocarbon reactants (like propane,
C3H8(g), the gas used to fire up backyard grills), and yield carbon dioxide and water as prod-
ucts. For example,
C3H8(g) + 5O2(g) →3CO2(g) + 4H2O(l)
Combustion reactions also include combination reactions between elements and oxygen,
such as:
S(s) + O2(g) →SO2(g)
So, if the reactants include oxygen (O2) and a hydrocarbon or an element, you’re probably
dealing with a combustion reaction. If the products are carbon dioxide and water, you’re
almost certainly dealing with a combustion reaction.

Be(s) + O2(g) →
A.
2Be(s) + O2(g) →2BeO(s). Although
beryllium isn’t on the metal activity
series, you can make a pretty good pre-
diction that this is a combination/com-
bustion reaction. Why? First, you have
two reactants. A single reactant would
imply decomposition. The beryllium
reactant is an element, not a compound,
so you can rule out double replacement.
The metal element reactant might make
you consider single replacement. But
there’s no metal in dioxygen, the other
reactant, so there’s no obvious replace-
ment partner. So the most likely reaction
is combination. When elements combine
with oxygen, that’s also a combustion
reaction.

Getting Rid of Mere Spectators: 
Net Ionic Equations
Chemistry is often conducted in aqueous solutions. Soluble ionic compounds dissolve into
their component ions, and these ions can react to form new products. In these kinds of reac-
tions, sometimes only the cation or anion of a dissolved compound reacts. The other ion
merely watches the whole affair, twiddling its charged thumbs in electrostatic boredom.
These uninvolved ions are called spectator ions.
Because spectator ions don’t actually participate in the chemistry of a reaction, you don’t
need to include them in a chemical equation. Doing so leads to a needlessly complicated
reaction equation. So, chemists prefer to write net ionic equations, which omit the spectator
ions. A net ionic equation doesn’t include every component that may be present in a given
beaker. Rather, it includes only those components that actually react.
Here is a simple recipe for making net ionic equations of your own:
1. Examine the starting equation to determine which ionic compounds are dissolved,
as indicated by the (aq) symbol following the compound name.
Zn(s) + HCl(aq) →ZnCl2(aq) + H2(g)
2. Rewrite the equation, explicitly separating dissolved ionic compounds into their
component ions.
This step requires you to recognize common polyatomic ions, so be sure to familiarize
yourself with them (flip to Chapter 6 for details).
Zn(s) + H+(aq) + Cl–(aq) →Zn2+(aq) + 2Cl–(aq) + H2(g)
3. Compare the reactant and product sides of the rewritten reaction. Any dissolved
ions that appear in the same form on both sides are spectator ions. Cross out the
spectator ions to produce a net reaction.
Zn(s) + H+(aq) + Cl-(aq) →Zn2+(aq) + 2Cl–(aq) + H2(g)
Net reaction:
Zn(s) + H+(aq) →Zn2+(aq) + H2(g)
As written, the preceding reaction is imbalanced with respect to the number of hydro-
gen atoms and the amount of positive charge.
4. Balance the net reaction for mass and charge.
Zn(s) + 2H+(aq) →Zn2+(aq) + H2(g)
If you want, you can balance the equation for mass and charge first (at Step 1). This way,
when you cross out spectator ions at Step 3, you cross out equivalent numbers of ions.
Either method produces the same net ionic equation in the end. Some people prefer to bal-
ance the starting reaction equation, but others prefer to balance the net reaction because it’s
a simpler equation.

Q.
Generate a balanced net ionic equation
for the following reaction:
CaCO3(s) + 2HCl(aq) →CaCl2(aq) + H2O(l)
+ CO2(g)
A.
CaCO3(s) + 2H+(aq) →Ca2+(aq) + H2O(l)
+ CO2(g)
Because HCl and CaCl2 are listed as aque-
ous (aq), rewrite the equation, explicitly
separating those compounds into their
ionic components:
CaCO3(s) + 2H+(aq) + 2Cl-(aq) →Ca2+(aq)
+ 2Cl-(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)
Next, cross out any components that
appear in the same form on both sides of
the equation. In this case, the chloride
ions (Cl-) are crossed out:
CaCO3(s) + 2H+(aq) + 2Cl-(aq) →Ca2+(aq) 
+ 2Cl-(aq) + H2O(l) + CO2(g)
This leaves the net reaction:
CaCO3(s) + 2H+(aq) →Ca2+(aq) + H2O(l) +
CO2(g)
The net reaction turns out to be bal-
anced for mass and charge, so it is the
balanced net ionic equation.

toichiometry. Such a complicated word for such a simple idea. The Greek roots of the
word mean “measuring elements,” which doesn’t sound nearly as intimidating. Moreover,
the ancient Greeks couldn’t tell an ionic bond from an ionic column, so just how technical and
scary could stoichiometry really be? Simply stated, stoichiometry (pronounced stoh-ick-eee-
ah-muh-tree) is the quantitative relationship between components of chemical substances. In
compound formulas and reaction equations, you express stoichiometry by using subscripted
numbers and coefficients.
If you arrived in this chapter by first wandering through Chapters 6, 7, and 8, then you’ve
already had breakfast, lunch, and an afternoon snack with stoichiometry. If you bypassed the
aforementioned chapters, then you haven’t eaten all day. Either way, it’s time for dinner.
Please pass the coefficients.
Using Mole-Mole Conversions 
from Balanced Equations
Mass and energy are conserved. It’s the Law. Unfortunately, this means that there’s no such
thing as a free lunch, or any other type of free meal. Ever. On the other hand, the conserva-
tion of mass makes it possible to predict how chemical reactions will turn out.
Chapter 8 describes why chemical reaction equations should be balanced for equal mass in
reactants and products. You balance an equation by adjusting the coefficients that precede
reactant and product compounds within the equation. Balancing equations can seem like a
chore, like taking out the trash. But a balanced equation is far better than any collection of
coffee grounds and orange peels because such an equation is a useful tool. After you’ve got a
balanced equation, you can use the coefficients to build mole-mole conversion factors. These
kinds of conversion factors tell you how much of any given product you get by reacting any
given amount of reactant. This is one of those calculations that makes chemists particularly
useful, so they needn’t get by on looks and charm alone.

Consider the following balanced equation for generating ammonia from nitrogen and hydro-
gen gases:
N2(g) + 3H2(g) →2NH3(g)
Industrial chemists around the globe perform this reaction, humorlessly fixating on how
much ammonia product they’ll end up with at the end of the day. (In fact, clever methods for
improving the rate and yield of this reaction garnered Nobel Prizes for two German gentle-
men, die Herren Haber und Bosch.) In any event, how are chemists to judge how closely their
reactions have approached completion? The heart of the answer lies in a balanced equation
and the mole-mole conversion factors that spring from it.
For every mole of dinitrogen reactant, a chemist expects 2 moles of ammonia product.
Similarly, for every 3 moles of dihydrogen reactant, the chemist expects 2 moles of ammonia
product. These expectations are based on the coefficients of the balanced equation and are
expressed as mole-mole conversion factors as shown in Figure 9-1.

Chapter 9: Putting Stoichiometry to Work

Putting Moles at the Center: Conversions
Involving Particles, Volumes, and Masses
The mole is the beating heart of stoichiometry, the central unit through which other quanti-
ties flow. Real-life chemists don’t have magic mole vision, however. A chemist can’t look at a
pile of potassium chloride crystals, squint her eyes, and proclaim: “That’s 0.539 moles of
salt.” Well, she could proclaim such a thing, but she wouldn’t bet her pocket protector on it.
Real reagents (reactants) tend to be measured in units of mass or volume, and occasionally
even in actual numbers of particles. Real products are measured in the same way. So, you
need to be able to use mole-mass, mole-volume, and mole-particle conversion factors to trans-
late between these different dialects of counting. Figure 9-2 summarizes the interrelationship
between all these things and serves as a flowchart for problem solving. All roads lead to and

Calcium carbonate decomposes to produce solid calcium oxide and carbon dioxide gas
according to the following reaction. Answer each part of the question assuming that 10.0g of
calcium carbonate decomposes.
CaCO3(s) →CaO(s) + CO2(g)
a. How many grams of calcium oxide are produced?
b. At standard temperature and pressure (STP), how many liters of carbon dioxide are pro-
duced?
A.
a. 5.61g CaO. First, convert 10.0g of calcium carbonate to moles of calcium carbonate by
using the molar mass of calcium carbonate (100g mol–1) as a conversion factor. This step
precedes the others in the calculation for each question. To determine the grams of calcium
oxide produced, follow the initial conversion with a mole-mole conversion to find the moles

of calcium oxide produced. Then convert from moles of calcium oxide to grams of calcium
oxide by using the molar mass of calcium oxide (56.1g mol–1) as a conversion factor:
b. 2.24L CO2. To determine the liters of carbon dioxide produced, follow the initial mass-
mole conversion with a mole-mole conversion to find the moles of carbon dioxide pro-
duced. Then convert from moles of carbon dioxide to liters by using the assumption that, at
STP, each mole of gas occupies 22.4L (see Chapter 7 for details):
Notice how both calculations require you first to translate into the language of moles, and
then perform a mole-mole conversion using stoichiometry from the reaction equation.
Finally, you convert into the desired units. Both solutions consist of a chain of conversion
factors, each factor bringing the units one step closer to those needed in the answer.

Limiting Your Reagents
In real-life chemical reactions, not all of the reactants present convert into product. That
would be perfect and convenient. Does that sound like real life to you? More typically, one
reagent is completely used up, and others are left in excess, perhaps to react another day.
The situation resembles that of a horde of Hollywood hopefuls lined up for a limited number
of slots as extras in a film. Only so many eager faces react with an available slot to produce a
happily (albeit pitifully) employed actor. The remaining actors are in excess, muttering quietly
all the way back to their jobs as waiters. In this scenario, the slots are the limiting reagent.
Those standing in line demand to know, how many slots are there? With this key piece of
data, they can deduce how many of their huddled mass will end up with a gig. Or, they can
figure out how many will continue to waste their film school degrees serving penne with basil
and goat cheese to chemists on vacation.
Chemists demand to know, which reactant will run out first? In other words, which reactant
is the limiting reagent? Knowing that information allows them to deduce how much product
they can expect, based on how much of the limiting reagent they’ve put into the reaction.
Also, identifying the limiting reagent allows them to calculate how much of the excess
reagent they’ll have left over when all the smoke clears. Either way, the first step is to figure
out which is the limiting reagent.

into product?
b. How many formula units (that is, moles
of ionic compound) of lead (IV) chloride
result from the reaction of 13.71g of lead
(II) chloride?
c. How many grams of lead (II) chloride

In any chemical reaction, you can simply pick one reagent as a candidate for the limiting
reagent, calculate how many moles of that reagent you have, and then calculate how many
grams of the other reagent you’d need to react both to completion. You’ll discover one of two
things. Either you have an excess of the first reagent, or you have an excess of the second
reagent. The one you have in excess is the excess reagent. The one that isn’t in excess is the
limiting reagent.

Q.
Ammonia reacts with oxygen to produce nitrogen monoxide and liquid water:
NH3(g) + O2(g) →NO(g) + H2O(l)
a. Balance the equation.
b. Determine the limiting reagent if 100g of ammonia and 100g of oxygen are present at the
beginning of the reaction.
c. What is the excess reagent and how many grams of the excess reagent will remain when
the reaction reaches completion?
d. How many grams of nitrogen monoxide will be produced if the reaction goes to completion?
e. How many grams of water will be produced if the reaction goes to completion?
A.
a. Before doing anything else, you must have a balanced reaction equation. Don’t waste
good thought on an unbalanced equation. The balanced form of the given equation is:
4NH3(g) + 5O2(g) →4NO(g) + 6H2O(l)
b. Oxygen is the limiting reagent. Two candidates vie for the status of limiting reagent, NH3
and O2. You start with 100g of each, which corresponds to some number of moles of each.
Furthermore, you require 4 moles of ammonia for every 5 moles of oxygen gas.
Starting with ammonia, the calculation to determine the limiting reagent goes as shown in
the following equation:
The calculation reveals that you’d need 235g of oxygen gas to completely react with 100g of
ammonia. But you only have 100g of oxygen. You’ll run out of oxygen before you run out of
ammonia, so oxygen is the limiting reagent.
c. The excess reagent is ammonia, and 57.5g of ammonia will remain when the reaction
reaches completion. To calculate how many grams of ammonia will be left at the end of the
reaction, assume that all 100g of oxygen react:
This calculation shows that 42.5g of the original 100g of ammonia will react before the limit-
ing reagent is expended. So, 100g – 42.5g = 57.5g of ammonia will remain in excess.

e. 67.5g of water will be produced. Again, assume that all 100g of the oxygen react in order
to determine how many grams of water are produced:
Reassuringly, the total mass of products (75g + 67.5g = 142.5g) equals the total mass of reac-
tants (100g + 42.5g = 142.5g), so the Conservation-of-Mass Police needn’t strap on the riot gear.

Counting Your Chickens after They’ve Hatched:
Percent Yield Calculations
In a way, reactants have it easy. Maybe they’ll make something of themselves and actually
react. Or maybe they’ll just lean against the inside of the beaker, flipping through a back
issue of People magazine and sipping a caramel macchiato.
Chemists don’t have it so easy. Someone is paying them to do reactions. That someone
doesn’t have time or money for excuses about loitering reactants. So you, as a fresh-faced
chemist, have to be concerned with just how completely your reactants react to form prod-
ucts. To compare the amount of product obtained from a reaction with the amount that
should have been obtained, chemists use percent yield. You determine percent yield with the
following formula:
Percent yield = 100% × (Actual yield) / (Theoretical yield)
Lovely, but what is an actual yield and what is a theoretical yield? An actual yield is . . . well . . .
the amount of product actually produced by the reaction. A theoretical yield is the amount
of product that could have been produced had everything gone perfectly, as described by
theory — in other words, as predicted by your painstaking calculations.
Things never go perfectly. Reagents stick to the sides of flasks. Impurities sabotage reactions.
Chemists attempt to dance. None of these ghastly things are supposed to occur, but they do.
So, actual yields fall short of theoretical yields.

reagent. So, sulfuric acid is the limiting reagent and is the reagent you should use to calcu-
late the theoretical yield:
Theory predicts that 46.59g of sodium sulfate product are possible if the reaction proceeds
perfectly and to completion. But the question states that the actual yield was only 37.91g of
sodium sulfate. With these two pieces of information, you can calculate the percent yield:

Begin limiting reagent problems by determining which is the limiting reagent. The answers to
other questions build on that foundation. To find the limiting reagent, simply pick one of the
reactants as a candidate. How much of your candidate reactant do you have? Use that informa-
tion to calculate how much of any other reactants you’d need for a complete reaction. You can
deduce the limiting and excess reagents from the results of these calculations.
a. Iron (III) oxide. In this example, iron (III) oxide was chosen as the initial candidate limiting
reagent. It turned out to be the correct choice because more carbon monoxide is initially
present than is required to react with all the iron (III) oxide.

b. Carbon monoxide is the excess reagent, and 41g of it will remain after the reaction is com-
pleted. Because iron (III) oxide is the limiting reagent, the excess reagent is carbon monoxide.
To find the amount of excess reagent that will remain after the reaction reaches completion,
first calculate how much of the excess reagent will be consumed. This calculation is identical
to the one performed in part a. So, 26g of carbon monoxide will be consumed. Next, subtract
the quantity consumed from the amount originally present to obtain the amount of carbon
monoxide that will remain: 67g – 26g = 41g.
c. 35g of iron; 41g of carbon dioxide. To answer this question, do two calculations, each start-
ing with the assumption that all the limiting reagent is consumed:
j
To find the limiting reagent, simply pick one of the reactants as a candidate. Calculate how
many of the other reagents you’d need to completely react with all of your available candidate
reagent. Deduce the limiting and excess reagents from these calculations.
a. Sodium. In this example, sodium was chosen as the initial candidate limiting reagent. It
turned out to be the correct choice because more water is initially present than is required to
react with all the sodium.
b. Water is the excess reagent, and 20.2g of it will remain after the reaction is completed.
Sodium is the limiting reagent, so the excess reagent is water.
The calculation in part a revealed how much water is consumed in a complete reaction: 
20g. Because 40.2g of water are initially present, 20.2g of water will remain after the reaction:
40.2g – 20g = 20.2g.
c. 43g of sodium hydroxide; 12L of hydrogen gas. To answer this question, do two calcula-
tions, each starting with the assumption that all the limiting reagent is consumed:
k
The first step is to identify the limiting reagent. Simply pick one of the reactants as a trial candi-
date for the limiting reagent, and calculate how much of the other reagents are required to
react completely with the candidate.
a. Chlorine gas. In this example, aluminum was chosen as the candidate limiting reagent. It
turns out that more chlorine gas is required (36.5L) to completely react with the available 
aluminum than is available (34.6L). So, chlorine gas is the limiting reagent.

b. Aluminum is the excess reagent, and 1.5g of it will remain after the reaction is completed.
To calculate how much excess reagent (aluminum, in this case) will remain after a complete
reaction, first calculate how much will be consumed, as shown in the equation that follows. It
turns out that 27.8g of aluminum will be consumed. Subtract that quantity from the amount
originally present to calculate the remaining amount: 29.3g – 27.8g = 1.5g.
c. 137g of aluminum chloride. This calculation starts with the assumption that all the limiting
reagent, chlorine gas in this case, is consumed.
l
The reaction equation is already balanced, so you can proceed with the calculations.
a. 88.46 is the percent yield. You’re given an actual yield and asked to calculate the percent
yield. To do so, you must calculate the theoretical yield. The question makes clear that sulfur
dioxide is the limiting reagent, so begin the calculation of theoretical yield by assuming that
all the sulfur dioxide is consumed.
So, the theoretical yield of sulfurous acid is 24.43g. With this information, you can calculate
the percent yield:
Percent yield = 100% × (21.61g / 24.43g) = 88.46%
b. 74.6% is the percent yield. Again, you’re asked to calculate a percent yield having been given
an actual yield. In this case, the limiting reagent is water, so begin the calculation by assuming
that all the water is consumed.
So, the theoretical yield of sulfurous acid is 37.0g. Using that information, calculate the per-
cent yield:
Percent yield = 100% × (27.59g / 37.0g) = 74.6%
m
With a balanced equation at your disposal, you can calculate with impunity.
a. 16.1L of dinitrogen are produced. In this question, you’re given the percent yield and asked
to calculate an actual yield. To do so, you must know the theoretical yield. The question
makes clear that hydrazine is the limiting reagent, so calculate the theoretical yield of dinitro-
gen by assuming that all the hydrazine is consumed.

So, the theoretical yield of dinitrogen is 16.4L. Algebraically rearrange the percent yield equa-
tion to solve for the actual yield:
Actual yield = (Theoretical yield × Percent yield) / 100%
Substitute for your known values and solve:
Actual yield = (16.4L × 98%) / 100% = 16.1L
b. 83.5% is the percent yield. In this question, you’re given the initial amounts of the reactants
and an actual yield. You’re asked to calculate a percent yield. To do so, you need to know the
theoretical yield. The added wrinkle in this problem (as opposed to the one in part a) is that
you don’t initially know which reagent is limiting. As with any limiting reagent problem, pick a
candidate limiting reagent. In this example, hydrazine is chosen as the initial candidate:
It turns out that more oxygen is required to react with the available hydrazine than is initially
present. So, oxygen is the limiting reagent. Knowing this, calculate a theoretical yield of water
by assuming that all the oxygen is consumed.
So, the theoretical yield of water is 61.5g. Use this information to calculate the percent yield:
Percent yield = 100% × (51.33g / 61.5g) = 83.5%

A
ny chemical drama unfolds on a stage, each charac-
ter following an individual script, driven by particu-
lar motivations. In this part, we explore some of the
common stages for chemical drama: gaseous and liquid
solutions. We describe how and why some chemical
dramas are one-act monologues while others are 12-act
masterworks; why some race to a conclusion, and others
stretch interminably over hours, days, and years. Finally,
we examine energy, the muse behind the drama, and how
differences in energy determine which characters do what
and when.

hen asked, children often report that solids, liquids, and gases are composed of dif-
ferent kinds of matter. This assumption is understandable given the striking differ-
ences in the properties of these three states. Nevertheless, for a given type of matter at a
given pressure, the fundamental difference between a solid, a liquid, and a gas actually is
the amount of energy within the particles of matter. Understanding the states of matter
(phases) in terms of energy and pressure helps to explain the different properties of those
states and how matter moves between the states. We explain what you need to know in this
chapter.
Describing States of Matter with Kinetic Theory
Imagine two pool balls, each glued to either end of a spring. How many different kinds of
motion could this contraption undergo? You could twist along the axis of the spring. You
could bend the spring or stretch it. You could twirl the whole thing around, or you could
throw it through the air. Molecules can undergo these same kinds of motions, and do so
when you supply them with energy. As collections of molecules undergo changes in energy,
those collections move through the states of matter — solid, liquid, and gas. The body of
ideas that explains all this is called kinetic theory.
Kinetic theory first made a name for itself when scientists attempted to explain and predict
the properties of gases, and, in particular, how those properties changed with varying tem-
perature and pressure. The idea emerged that the particles of matter within a gas (atoms or
molecules) undergo a serious amount of motion as a result of the kinetic energy within them.
Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. Gas particles have a lot of kinetic energy, and con-
stantly zip about, colliding with one another or with other objects. This is a complicated pic-
ture, but scientists simplified things by assuming that all the motions of the particles were
random, that the only motion was translation (moving from place to place, as opposed to
twisting, vibrating, and spinning), and that when particles collided, the collisions were elastic
(perfectly bouncy, with no loss of energy). The gas particles were assumed to neither attract
nor repel one another. Gases that actually behave in this simplified way are called ideal. The

model of ideal gases explains why gas pressure increases with increased temperature. By
heating a gas, you add kinetic energy to the particles; as a result, the particles collide with
greater force upon other objects, so those objects experience greater pressure. (Check out
Chapter 11 for full details on gas laws.)
When atoms or molecules have less kinetic energy, or when that energy must compete with
other effects (like high pressure or strong attractive forces), the matter ceases to be in the
diffuse, gaseous state and comes together into one of the condensed states: liquid or solid.
Here are the differences between the two:
 The particles within a liquid are much closer together than those in a gas. As a result,
applying pressure to a liquid does very little to change the volume. The particles still
have an appreciable amount of kinetic energy associated with them, so they may
undergo various kinds of twisting, stretching, and vibrating motions. In addition, the
particles can slide past one another (translate) fairly easily, so liquids are fluid, though
less fluid than gases. Fluid matter assumes the shape of anything that contains it.
 The state of matter with the least amount of kinetic energy is the solid. In a solid, the par-
ticles are packed together quite tightly and undergo almost no translation. Therefore,
solids are not fluid. Matter in the solid state may still vibrate in place or undergo other
low-energy types of motion, however, depending on its temperature (in other words, on
its kinetic energy).
The temperatures and pressures at which different types of matter switch between states
depend on the unique properties of the atoms or molecules within that matter. Typically, par-
ticles that are very attracted to one another and have easily stackable shapes tend toward
condensed states. Particles with no mutual attraction (or that have mutual repulsion) and
with not so easily stackable shapes tend toward the gaseous state. Think of a football game
between fiercely rival schools. When fans of either school sit in their own section of the
stands, the crowd is orderly, sitting nicely in rows. Put rival fans into the same section of
the stands, however, and they’ll repel each other with great energy.

Part III: Examining Changes in Terms of Energy 
Q.
Are real-life gases more likely to behave
like ideal gases at very high pressure or
very low pressure, and why?
A.
Real-life gases are more likely to behave
like ideal gases when they are at very low
pressure. Under very high pressure con-
ditions, gas particles are much closer
to one another and undergo greater
numbers of collisions. Because of their
close proximity, real-life gas particles are
more likely to experience mutual attrac-
tions or repulsions. Because of their
more frequent collisions, gases at very
high pressure are more likely to reveal
the effects of any inelasticity in their col-
lisions (losing energy upon colliding).

2.
Ice floats in water. Based on the usual
assumptions of kinetic theory, why is this
weird?

3.
At the same temperature, how would the pressure of an ideal gas differ from that of a gas with
mutually attractive particles? How would it differ from that of a gas with mutually repulsive
particles?

Chapter 10: Understanding States in Terms of Energy

Make a Move: Figuring Out Phase
Transitions and Diagrams
Each state (solid, liquid, gas) is called a phase. When matter moves from one phase to
another because of changes in temperature and/or pressure, that matter is said to undergo
a phase transition. Moving from liquid to gas is called boiling, and the temperature at which
boiling occurs is called the boiling point. Moving from solid to liquid is called melting, and
the temperature at which melting occurs is called the melting point. The melting point is the
same as the freezing point, but freezing implies matter moving from liquid to solid phase.
At the surface of a liquid, molecules can enter the gas phase more easily than elsewhere
within the liquid because the motions of those molecules aren’t as constrained by the mole-
cules around them. So, these surface molecules can enter the gas phase at temperatures
below the liquid’s characteristic boiling point. This low-temperature phase change is called
evaporation and is very sensitive to pressure. Low pressures allow for greater evaporation,
while high pressures encourage molecules to re-enter the liquid phase in a process called
condensation. The pressure of the gas over the surface of a liquid is called the vapor pressure.
Understandably, liquids with low boiling points tend to have high vapor pressures because
the particles are weakly attracted to each other. At the surface of a liquid, weakly interacting
particles have a better chance to escape into the vapor phase, thereby increasing the vapor
pressure. See how kinetic theory helps make sense of things?
At the right combination of pressure and temperature, matter can move directly from solid
to a gas or vapor. This type of phase change is called sublimation, and is the kind of phase
change responsible for the white mist that emanates from dry ice, the common name for
solid carbon dioxide. Movement in the opposite direction, from gas directly into solid phase,
is called desublimation.
For any given type of matter there is a unique combination of pressure and temperature at
the nexus of all three states. This pressure-temperature combination is called the triple point.
At the triple point, all three phases coexist. In the case of good old H2O, going to the triple
point would produce boiling ice water. Take a moment to bask in the weirdness.
Other weird phases include plasma and supercritical fluids.
 Plasma is a gas-like state in which electrons pop off gaseous atoms to produce a mix-
ture of free electrons and cations (atoms or molecules with positive charge). For most
types of matter, achieving the plasma state requires very high temperatures, very low
pressures, or both. Matter at the surface of the sun, for example, exists as plasma.
 Supercritical fluids exist under high temperature–high pressure conditions. For a given
type of matter, there is a unique combination of temperature and pressure called the
critical point. At temperatures and pressures higher than those at this point, the phase
boundary between liquid and gas disappears, and the matter exists as a kind of liquidy
gas or gassy liquid. Supercritical fluids can diffuse through solids like gases do, but can
also dissolve things like liquids do.
Phase diagrams are useful tools for describing the states of a given type of matter across dif-
ferent temperatures and pressures. A phase diagram usually displays changes in tempera-
ture on the horizontal axis, and changes in pressure on the vertical axis. Lines drawn within
the temperature-pressure field of the diagram represent the boundaries between phases, as
shown for water and carbon dioxide in Figure 10-1.

Q.
Ethanol (C2H6O) has a freezing point of
–114°C. 1-Propanol (C3H8O) has a melting
point of –88°C. At 25°C (where both com-
pounds are liquids), which one is likely to
have the higher vapor pressure, and why?
A.
Ethanol has the higher vapor pressure at
25°C. First, notice that a freezing point
and a melting point are the same thing —
the temperature at which a substance
undergoes the liquid-solid or solid-liquid
phase transition. Next, compare the
freezing/melting points of ethanol and
propanol. Much colder temperatures
must be achieved to freeze ethanol than
to freeze propanol. This suggests that
ethanol molecules have fewer attractive
forces between themselves than do
propanol molecules. At 25°C, both com-
pounds are in liquid phase. Pure liquids
in which the particles have less intermol-
ecular (between-molecule) attraction
have higher vapor pressure, because it’s
easier for molecules at the surface of the
liquid to escape into vapor (gas) phase.

Discerning Differences in Solid States
Solids all have less kinetic energy than their liquid or gaseous counterparts, but that doesn’t
mean all solids are alike. Make any such claim and you’ll instantly offend a whole class of sci-
entists called solid state chemists. It may be that this is an overly sensitive group to begin
with, but they have a solid point.
To begin with, the properties of a solid depend heavily on the forces between the particles
within it.
 Ionic solids are held together by an array of very strong ionic bonds (see Chapter 5 for
more about these bonds), and therefore tend to have high melting points — it takes a
great deal of energy to break apart the particles.
 Molecular solids consist of packed molecules that are less strongly attractive to each
other, so molecular solids tend to have lower melting points.
 Some solids consist of particles that are covalently bonded to one another; these cova-
lent solids tend to be exceptionally strong because of the strength of their extensive
covalent bond network; one example of a covalent solid is diamond. Covalent solids
have very high melting points. Ever try to melt a diamond? (Chapter 5 has details about
covalent bonds.)
In addition, the degree of order in the packing of particles within a solid can vary tremendously.
 Most solids are highly ordered, packing into neat, repeating patterns called crystals.
The smallest packing unit, the one that repeats over and over to form the crystalline
solid, is called the unit cell. Crystalline solids tend to have well-defined melting points.
 Amorphous solids are those solids that lack an ordered packing structure. Glass and
plastic are examples of amorphous solids. Amorphous solids tend to melt over a broad
range of temperatures.
When cooling a liquid through a phase transition into a solid, the rate of cooling can have a
significant impact on the properties of the solid. The extreme order with which particles are
packed together in crystalline solids can take lots of time. So, substances that are capable of
forming crystalline solids may nevertheless freeze into amorphous solids if they’re cooled
rapidly. The particles may become trapped in disordered packing arrangements.

A liquid sample is divided into two
batches. The first batch is very rapidly
cooled to a temperature below the freezing
point. The second batch is cooled to the
same temperature, but very slowly. Then
the two batches are slowly reheated. The
melting point of one batch is measured to
be precisely 280K. The other batch appears
to melt gradually over 270–290K. What

Chemists can sometimes figure out the
three-dimensional structure of molecules
by making a pure crystalline sample of the

the crystal. These kinds of experiments are
often performed while the crystal is cooled

Q.
At normal pressures, H2 melts at –259°C,
H2O melts at 0°C, NaCl melts at 801°C,
and diamond (pure carbon) melts at
3,550°C. What are the different proper-
ties of these compounds that best
explain such a wide range of melting
points?
A.
H2 is a completely nonpolar molecule
that forms a molecular solid; the interac-
tions between H2 molecules within this
solid are very weak, so even small
amounts of heat energy disrupt them.
H2O also forms a molecular solid, but
H2O is a highly polar molecule; within
the H2O solid, molecules align them-
selves to take maximum advantage of
attractive forces between dipoles. More
heat must be added to disrupt these
interactions than is required to melt H2.
NaCl is an ionic solid, composed of a lat-
tice of alternating Na+ cations and Cl-
anions; the attractive forces between
ions of opposite charge are strong, so it
takes a lot of heat energy to disrupt
them. Diamond is a covalent solid, com-
posed of a network of covalently inter-
connected carbon atoms. Each carbon
atom is covalently bound to three others;
it takes a tremendous amount of heat
energy to disrupt these bonds.

Answers to Questions on Changes of State
By this point in the chapter, you may feel depleted of kinetic energy. But that’s okay,
because it means that you’re more ordered, right? See whether that lovely order is
reflected in your answers to the practice questions.
a
The noble gases are described as noble because, due to their full valence shells, they have very
low reactivity. Only very weak forces occur between the atoms of noble gas. The particles don’t
significantly attract one another under any but the most extreme (high pressure, low tempera-
ture) conditions. Therefore, only a small amount of heat is required to push these elements into
the gas phase.
b
Kinetic theory describes matter as moving from solid to liquid phase (melting) as you add energy
to the sample. The added energy causes the particles to undergo greater motion, and to collide
with other particles more energetically. Usually, this means that a liquid is less dense than a solid
sample of the same material, because the greater motion of the liquid particles prevents close
packing. Solid water (ice), on the other hand, is less dense than liquid water because of the
unique geometry of water crystals. Because solid water is less dense than liquid water, ice floats
in water.
c
At a given temperature, an ideal gas would exert greater pressure than a gas with mutually
attractive particles and lower pressure than a gas with mutually repulsive particles. On aver-
age, mutual attraction allows particles to occupy a smaller volume at a given kinetic energy,
while mutual repulsion causes particles to attempt to occupy a larger volume.
d
The frozen water sublimed, moving directly from a solid to a gaseous state. This process
occurs slowly at the temperatures and pressures found within normal household freezers, but
does occur. Try it.
e
The sample would most likely move from supercritical fluid to gas. Allowing carbon dioxide
to escape (while holding the temperature constant) results in decreased pressure, correspon-
ding to a downward vertical movement on the phase diagram of carbon dioxide.
f
Although the two batches consisted of the same type of matter, they froze into different types
of solids because of the difference in cooling rate. The rapidly cooled sample froze into an
amorphous solid because kinetic energy was removed from the particles more rapidly than
they could order themselves into a crystalline state. The slowly cooled sample froze into a
crystalline solid. The amorphous solid melted over a broad range of temperatures, whereas
the crystalline solid melted at a well-defined meting point.
g
Cooling the crystals maintains the crystalline packing order by keeping the molecules in a
state of very low kinetic energy. Shining an X-ray beam into the sample adds energy to the mole-
cules, threatening to disrupt their packing order. Simultaneously cooling the crystal maintains
the order. Because the order of the crystal is maintained, the collected X-ray data can be more
easily interpreted to figure out the structure of the molecules within the crystal.

t first pass, gases may seem to be the most mysterious of the states of matter. Nebulous
and wispy, gases easily slip through our grip. For all their diffuse fluidity, however,
gases are actually the best understood of the states. The key thing to understand about
gases is that they tend to behave in the same ways — physically, if not chemically. For exam-
ple, gases expand to fill the entire volume of any container in which you put them. Also,
gases are easily compressed into smaller volumes. Even more so than liquids, gases easily
form homogenous mixtures. Because so much open space occurs between individual gas
particles, these particles are pretty laid back about the idiosyncrasies of their neighbors.
Chapter 10 sets down the basic assumptions of the kinetic molecular theory of gases, a set
of ideas that explains gas properties in terms of the motions of gas particles. In summary,
kinetic molecular theory describes the properties of ideal gases, ones that conform to the
following criteria:
 Ideal gas particles have a volume that is insignificant compared to the volume the gas
occupies as a whole. The relatively small volume of a 20-ounce soda bottle, for exam-
ple, completely dwarfs the individual gas particles inside the bottle, making their sizes
irrelevant to any ideal gas calculation.
 Ideal gases consist of very large numbers of particles in constant random motion.
 Ideal gas particles are neither attracted to one another nor repelled by one another.
 Ideal gas particles exchange energy only by means of perfectly elastic collisions —
collisions in which the total kinetic energy of the particles remains constant.
Like all ideals (the ideal job, the ideal mate, and so on), ideal gases are entirely fictional. All
gas particles occupy some volume. All gas particles have some degree of inter-particle
attraction or repulsion. No collision of gas particles is perfectly elastic. But lack of perfection
is no reason to remain unemployed or lonely. Neither is it a reason to abandon kinetic molec-
ular theory of ideal gases. In this chapter, you’re introduced to a wide variety of applications
of kinetic theory, which come in the form of the so-called “gas laws.”

Getting the Vapors: Evaporation 
and Vapor Pressure
Because kinetic molecular theory explains the movement of particles between different
phases, it comes as no surprise that we find gases in the presence of liquids. Within a liquid,
individual particles have any of a range of kinetic energies. At any given moment, some frac-
tion of particles on the surface of the liquid possesses enough kinetic energy to escape into
the gas phase. Collections of these gas-phase “refugee” particles, hovering over the surface
of a liquid, are called vapor. The process by which particles escape the surface of a liquid
into the vapor phase is called evaporation. Of course, the escaped particles may fall back
into captivity in a process called condensation. Given enough time, the rate at which particles
escape comes to equal the rate at which they are recaptured, and this state of affairs is called
a dynamic equilibrium.
Vapor pressure is the pressure at which vapor is in dynamic equilibrium with liquid. As evap-
oration occurs, the pressure above the surface of a liquid increases because more particles
are added to that volume. Eventually, the pressure over the surface of the liquid equals the
vapor pressure of that liquid, at which point evaporation equals condensation. Why does
increased pressure produce condensation? What is pressure, anyway? In short, pressure is a
force applied over an area — like the area of the surface of a liquid, for example. At the
molecular scale, pressure arises from the collisions of countless particles with that surface.
At higher pressure, then, more gas particles are colliding more frequently with the surface of
the liquid. These collisions make it more difficult for liquid-phase particles to escape and
make it more likely that gas-phase particles will be recaptured. The final important piece of
information to retain about vapor pressure is its relationship to boiling; specifically, when the
vapor pressure of a liquid reaches the atmospheric pressure, a liquid will boil.
Vapor pressure depends on temperature because temperature affects the dynamic equilib-
rium. Adding heat to a sample increases the average kinetic energy of the particles within
that sample. Temperature is simply a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles
in a sample. So at higher temperatures, particles possess greater kinetic energy and are more
likely to escape into vapor phase. The higher the temperature, the higher the vapor pressure.
Pressure is also directly related to altitude. If you’ve ever tried to take a deep breath from a
mountaintop, you know that the air is “thinner” at higher elevation, making it harder to get
sufficient oxygen. This is because the relative atmospheric pressure is lower than at sea
level, and fewer oxygen particles are in a given volume of air.

Q.
Legend has it that watched pots do not
boil. Rigorous experimentation has
proved this maxim to be false. Some
kitchen theorists claim that placing a
tight-fitting lid on a pot (to prevent unau-
thorized pot-watching) actually causes
water to boil at a higher temperature
than does water in a pot with no lid. Is
this claim plausible? Why or why not?
A.
The claim is plausible. Placing a tight-
fitting lid on a pot of water traps water
vapor inside. Because the lid traps vapor
inside, the pressure in the space above
the water increases beyond the atmos-
pheric pressure in the kitchen. As heat is
added to the water, the vapor pressure
increases. Boiling occurs only when the
vapor pressure of the water reaches

and/or exceeds the pressure over the
surface of the liquid. So, water in the
lidded pot must be heated more than
water in an open pot before it will boil.
Of course, water in a lidded pot may nev-
ertheless boil more quickly, because the
lid also traps heat that would otherwise
escape.
Playing with Pressure and Volume: Boyle’s Law
Although the explanation of vapor pressure and evaporation endures for only a few para-
graphs in the previous section, it mentions four important variables: pressure, volume, tem-
perature, and the number of particles. Relationships between these four factors are the
domain of the gas laws. We take a look at these in this section and the rest of the chapter.
The first of these relationships to have been formulated into a law is that between pressure
and volume. Robert Boyle, an Irish gentleman regarded by some as the first chemist (or
“chymist,” as his friends might have said), is typically given credit for noticing that gas pres-
sure and volume have an inverse relationship:
Volume = Constant × (1/Pressure)
This statement is true when the other two factors, temperature and number of particles, are
fixed. Another way to express the same idea is to say that although pressure and volume
may change, they do so in such a way that their product remains constant. So, as a gas
undergoes change in pressure (P) and volume (V) between two states, the following is true:
P1 × V1 = P2 × V2

Solve It
The relationship makes good sense in light of kinetic molecular theory. At a given tempera-
ture and number of particles, more collisions will occur at smaller volumes. These increased
collisions produce greater pressure. And vice versa. Boyle had some dubious ideas about
alchemy, among other things, but he really struck gold with the pressure-volume relationship
in gases.
Q.
A sealed plastic bag is filled with 1L of air
at standard temperature and pressure
(STP). You accidentally sit on the bag.
The maximum pressure the bag can with-
hold before popping is 500 kilopascals
(kPa). What is the internal volume of the
bag at the instant of popping?
A.
0.2L. The problem tells us that the bag
has an initial volume, V1, of 1L, and an 
initial pressure, P1, of 101.3 kPa (the pres-
sure at STP). (See Chapter 7 if you’ve
momentarily forgotten the definition of
STP.) The pressure inside the bag
reaches 500 kPa before popping, so that
value represents P2. So, the only missing
variable is the final volume. Solve for the
final volume, V2, by plugging in the
known values:
V2 = (1L × 101.3 kPa)/500 kPa = 0.2L

Tinkering with Volume and Temperature:
Charles’s Law and Absolute Zero
Lest the Irish have all the gassy fun, the French contributed a gas law of their own. History
attributes this law to French chemist Jacques Charles. Charles discovered a direct, linear
relationship between the volume and the temperature of a gas:
Volume = Constant × Temperature
This statement is true when the other two factors, pressure and number of particles, are
fixed. Another way to express the same idea is to say that although temperature and volume
may change, they do so in such a way that their ratio remains constant. So, as a gas under-
goes change in temperature (T) and volume (V) between two states, the following is true:
V1 / T1 = V2 / T2
Not to be outdone by the French, another Irish scientist took Charles’s observations and ran
with them. William Thomson, eventually to be known as Lord Kelvin, took stock of all the
data available in his mid-19th century heyday and noticed a few things:
 First, plotting the volume of a gas versus its temperature always produced a straight line.
 Second, extending these various lines caused them all to converge at a single point,
corresponding to a single temperature at zero volume. This temperature — though not
directly accessible in experiments — was about –273 degrees Celsius. Kelvin took the
opportunity to enshrine himself in the annals of scientific history by declaring that
temperature as absolute zero, the lowest temperature possible.
This declaration had at least two immediate benefits. First, it happened to be correct.
Second, it allowed Kelvin to create the Kelvin temperature scale, with absolute zero as the
Official Zero. Using the Kelvin scale (where °C = K – 273), everything makes a whole lot more
sense. For example, doubling the Kelvin temperature of a gas doubles the volume of that gas.
When you work with Charles’s Law, converting Celsius temperatures to Kelvin is crucial.

temperature, an initial volume, and a final

plugging in the known values and solving
for the final temperature. But take care —
Charles’s Law requires you to convert all
temperatures to K (where K = °C + 273).
After a few hours outdoors, it’s safe to
assume that the temperature of the ball
has reached equilibrium. Because the
volume of the ball decreased, expect the
outdoor temperature to be lower than the
temperature in the basement:
T2 = (293K × 3.00L) / 3.50L = 251K
This temperature corresponds to –22°C. 
Vince may have some judgment issues.

No. Enter the Combined Gas Law:
Of course, the real universe can fight back by changing another variable. In the real universe,
for example, tires spring leaks. In such a situation, gas particles escape the confines of the
tire. This escape decreases the number of particles, n, within the tire. Cranky, tire-iron wield-

PV = nRT
Here, R is the gas constant, the one quantity of the equation that can’t change. Of course, 
the exact identity of this constant depends on the units you’re using for pressure, tem-
perature, and volume. A very common form of the gas constant as used by chemists is 
R = 0.08206L atm K–1 mol–1. Alternately, you may encounter R = 8.314L kPa K–1 mol–1.

your units agree with those used in the
gas constant you’ve chosen. Here, we use
R = 0.08206L atm K–1 mol–1. So, we must
convert the temperature (10°C) into
Kelvin, K = 10 + 273 = 283 K. Next, plug

Mixing It Up with Dalton’s Law of Partial
Pressures
Gases mix. They do so better than liquids and infinitely better than solids. So, what’s the rela-
tionship between the total pressure of a gaseous mixture and the pressure contributions of
the individual gases? Here is a satisfyingly simple answer: Each individual gas within the mix-
ture contributes a partial pressure, and adding the partial pressures yields the total pressure.
This relationship is summarized by Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures, for a mixture of individ-
ual gases:
Ptotal = P1 + P2 + P3 + . . . + Pn
This relationship makes sense if you think about pressure in terms of kinetic molecular
theory. Adding a gaseous sample into a volume that already contains other gases increases
the number of particles in that volume. Because pressure depends on the number of parti-
cles colliding with the container walls, increasing the number of particles increases the pres-
sure proportionally.

She constructs an apparatus to combine

Diffusing and Effusing with Graham’s Law
“Wake up and smell the coffee.” This command is usually issued in a scornful tone, but most
people who have awakened to the smell of coffee remember the event fondly. The morning
gift of coffee aroma is made possible by a phenomenon called diffusion. Diffusion is the move-
ment of a substance from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.
Diffusion occurs spontaneously, on its own. Diffusion leads to mixing, eventually producing
a homogenous mixture in which the concentration of any gaseous component is equal
throughout an entire volume. Of course, that state of complete diffusion is an equilibrium
state; achieving equilibrium can take time.
Different gases diffuse at different rates, depending on their molar masses (see Chapter 7 for
details on molar masses). The rates at which two gases diffuse can be compared using
Graham’s Law. Graham’s Law also applies to effusion, the process in which gas molecules
flow through a small hole in a container. Whether gases diffuse or effuse, they do so at a rate
inversely proportional to the square root of their molar mass. In other words, more massive
gas molecules diffuse and effuse more slowly than less massive gas molecules. So, for gases

Q.
How much faster does hydrogen gas
effuse than neon gas?
A.
3.2 times faster. First, “hydrogen gas”
refers to dihydrogen, H2. Next, consult
your periodic table (or your memory, if
you’re that good) to obtain the molar
masses of dihydrogen gas (2.0g mol–1)
and neon gas (20g mol–1). Finally plug
those values into the appropriate places
within Graham’s Law.
So, dihydrogen effuses 3.2 times faster

Tomoko is at the higher altitude. As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. As
temperature increases, vapor pressure increases. Liquids boil when their vapor pressure
exceeds the external (atmospheric) pressure. So, because Tomoko’s water boils at a lower tem-
perature, she must be at a higher altitude, where atmospheric pressure is lower. Tomoko is the
hardcore hiker.
b
750m. Boiling point decreases linearly with external pressure. Because the atmospheric pres-
sure on Blurgblar decreases linearly with altitude, boiling point and altitude also have a linear
relationship on this odd planet. To calculate the altitude where the physicist emerged, you
must determine the linear relationship between altitude and boiling point. The total elevation
increase between sea level and the peak of Mount J-11 is 2,250m. The decrease in boiling point
over that change in altitude is –15K (298K – 283K). So, the boiling point decreases by 1K for
every 150m increase in altitude:
2,250m / 15K = 150 m/K
The dying physicist observed a boiling point 5K lower than the one observed at sea level. So,
the physicist is 850m above sea level:
5K × 150 m/K = 750m
c
0.4L. You’re given an initial pressure, an initial volume, and a final pressure. Boyle’s Law leaves
you with one unknown: final volume. Solve for the final volume by plugging in the known
values:
V2 = (1 atm × 0.5L) / 1.25 atm = 0.4L
d
2.5 atm. Under the initial conditions, gas at 5 atm resides in a 1.5L volume. When the seal is
removed, the entire 3L of the container becomes available to the gas, which expands to occupy
the new volume. Predictably, its pressure decreases. To calculate the new pressure, P2, plug in
the known values and solve:
P2 = (5 atm × 1.5L) / 3L = 2.5 atm
e
10L. You’re given the initial volume and initial temperature of the balloon, as well as the bal-
loon’s final temperature. Apply Charles’s Law, plugging in the known values and solving for the
final volume. Be careful — all temperatures must be expressed in units of K:
V2 = (300L × 323K) / 313K = 310L
The difference in volume due to heat-induced inflation is 310L – 300L = 10L.
f
–39°C. Charles’s Law is the method here. The unknown is the final temperature, T2. You’re given
an initial temperature, as well as the initial and final volumes. After converting the tempera-
tures to units of K, plug in the known values and solve for final temperature:
T2 = (293K × 0.200L) / 0.250L = 234K
This final temperature corresponds to –39°C. That’s one serious freezer.
g
280L. The number of moles of gas (10 mol) remains constant. The other three factors (pres-
sure, temperature, and volume) all change between initial and final states. So, you need to use
the Combined Gas Law. The initial values (2.9 × 102 atm, 283K, 0.80L) all derive from the exam-
ple problem. The final temperature and pressure are known (273K, 1 atm) because the question
states that the gas ends up at STP. So, the only unknown is the final volume. Rearrange the

Combined Gas Law to solve for this value:
h
59.7mol. This problem simply requires use of the Ideal Gas Law, arranged to solve for number
of moles, n. Don’t forget to convert temperature to units of K and to use the appropriate ver-
sion of the gas constant, R.
i
0.244L. You’re given an initial volume, initial temperature, and initial pressure. You’re also given
a final pressure and a final temperature. The only unknown is final volume. Rearrange the
Combined Gas Law to solve for final volume, V2.
Despite the fact that the final temperature is higher than the initial temperature, the final
volume is much smaller than the initial volume. In effect, 10 trifling degrees are no match for
the pressure exerted by Bertha’s posterior.
j
98.1 kPa. The system has come to equilibrium, so the interior of the tube contains a gaseous
mixture of dihydrogen and water vapor. Because the water levels inside and outside the tube
are equal, you know that the total pressure inside the tube equals the ambient pressure of the
lab, 101.3 kPa. The total pressure includes the partial pressure contributions from dihydrogen
and from water vapor. Set up an equation using Dalton’s Law:
Ptotal = P(H2) + P(H2O)
Rearrange the equation to solve for P(H2) and substitute in the known values to solve:
P(H2) = 101.3 kPa – 3.17 kPa = 98.1 kPa
k
Dihydrogen, H2. The question states that the ratio of the rates is 4.0. Recall that oxygen gas is
dioxygen, O2, with a molar mass of 32g mol–1. Substitute these known values into Graham’s Law.
Square both sides of this equation to bring values out from underneath the radicals.
Next, rearrange to solve for the molar mass of Gas A:
Molar mass A = (32/16)g mol–1 = 2.0g mol–1
This molar mass is consistent with dihydrogen, H2.

ompounds can form mixtures. When compounds mix completely, right down to the
level of individual molecules, we call the mixture a solution. Each type of compound in
a solution is called a component. The component of which there is the most is usually called
the solvent. The other components are called solutes. Although most people think “liquid”
when they think of solutions, a solution can be a solid, liquid, or gas. The only criterion is
that the components are completely intermixed. We explain what you need to know in this
chapter.
Seeing Different Forces at Work in Solubility
For gases, forming a solution is a straightforward process. Gases simply diffuse into a
common volume (see Chapter 11 for more about diffusion). Things are a bit more compli-
cated for condensed states like liquids and solids. In liquids and solids, molecules or ions
are crammed so closely together that intermolecular forces are very important. Examples of
these kinds of forces include ion-dipole, dipole-dipole, hydrogen bonding, and London
(dispersion) forces. We touch on the physical underpinnings of these forces in Chapter 5.
Introducing a solute into a solvent initiates a tournament of forces. Attractive forces between
solute and solvent compete with attractive solute-solute and solvent-solvent forces. A solu-
tion forms only to the extent that solute-solvent forces dominate over the others. The
process in which solvent molecules compete and win in the tournament of forces is called
solvation or, in the specific case where water is the solvent, hydration. Solvated solutes are
surrounded by solvent molecules. When solute ions or molecules become separated from
one another and surrounded in this way, we say they’re dissolved.
Imagine that the members of a ridiculously popular “boy band” exit their hotel to be greeted
by an assembled throng of fans and the media. The band members attempt to cling to each
other, but are soon overwhelmed by the crowd’s ceaseless, repeated attempts to get closer.
Soon, each member of the band is surrounded by his own attending shell of reporters and
hyperventilating teenage girls. So it is with dissolution.

The tournament of forces plays out differently among different combinations of components.
In mixtures where solute and solvent are strongly attracted to one another, more solute can
be dissolved. One factor that always tends to favor dissolution is entropy, a kind of disorder
or “randomness” within a system. Dissolved solutes are less ordered than undissolved
solutes. Beyond a certain point, however, adding more solute to a solution doesn’t result in a
greater amount of solvation. At this point, the solution is in dynamic equilibrium; the rate at
which solute becomes solvated equals the rate at which dissolved solute crystallizes, or falls
out of solution. A solution in this state is saturated. By contrast, an unsaturated solution is one
that can accommodate more solute. A supersaturated solution is one in which more solute is
dissolved than is necessary to make a saturated solution. A supersaturated solution is unsta-
ble; solute molecules may crash out of solution given the slightest perturbation. The situa-
tion is like that of Wile E. Coyote who runs off a cliff and remains suspended in the air until
he looks down — at which point he inevitably falls.
The concentration of solute required to make a saturated solution is the solubility of that
solute. Solubility varies with the conditions of the solution. The same solute may have differ-
ent solubility in different solvents, and at different temperatures, and so on.
When one liquid is added to another, the extent to which they intermix is called miscibility.
Typically, liquids that have similar properties mix well — they are miscible. Liquids with dis-
similar properties often don’t mix well — they are immiscible. This pattern is summarized by
the phrase, “like dissolves like.” Alternately, you may understand miscibility in terms of the
Italian Salad Dressing Principle. Inspect a bottle of Italian salad dressing that has been sitting
in your refrigerator. Observe the following: The dressing consists of two distinct layers, an
oily layer and a watery layer. Before using, you must shake the bottle to temporarily mix the
layers. Eventually, they’ll separate again because water is polar and oil is nonpolar. (See
Chapter 5 if the distinction between polar and nonpolar is lost on you.) Polar and nonpolar
liquids mix poorly, though occasionally with positive gastronomic consequences.
Similarity or difference in polarity between components is often a good predictor of solubil-
ity, regardless of whether those components are liquid, solid, or gas. Why is polarity such a
good predictor? Because polarity is central to the tournament of forces that underlies solu-
bility. So, solids held together by ionic bonds (the most polar type of bond) or polar covalent
bonds tend to dissolve well in polar solvents, like water. For a refresher on ionic and covalent
bonding, visit Chapter 5.

Q.
Sodium chloride dissolves more than 25
times better in water than in methanol.
Explain this difference, referring to the
structure and properties of water,
methanol, and sodium chloride.
A.
Sodium chloride (NaCl) is an ionic solid,
a lattice composed of sodium cations
(atoms with positive charge) alternating
with chlorine anions (atoms with nega-
tive charge). The lattice has a highly
regular, idealized geometry and is held
together by ionic bonds, the most polar
type of bond. To dissolve NaCl, a solvent
must be able to engage in very polar
interactions with these ions and do so
with near-ideal geometry. The structure
and properties of water (which is polar)
are better suited to this task than are
those of methanol (see the following
figure). The two O–H bonds of water
(on the left) partially sum to produce a
strong dipole along the mirror image
plane of the molecule that runs between
the two hydrogen atoms. Methanol (on
the right) is also polar, due largely to its

Altering Solubility with Temperature
Increasing temperature magnifies the effects of entropy on a system. Because the entropy of
a solute is usually increased when it dissolves, increasing temperature usually increases sol-
ubility — for solid and liquid solutes, anyway. Another way to understand the effect of tem-
perature on solubility is to think about heat as a reactant in the dissolution reaction:
Solid solute + Water + Heat →Dissolved solute
Heat is usually absorbed when a solute dissolves. Increasing temperature corresponds to
added heat. So, by increasing temperature you supply a needed reactant in the dissolution
reaction. (In those rare cases where dissolution releases heat, increasing temperature can
decrease solubility.)

Gaseous solutes behave differently than do solid or liquid solutes with respect to tempera-
ture. Increasing the temperature tends to decrease the solubility of gas in liquid. To under-
stand this pattern, check out the concept of vapor pressure. (If creaking sounds emanate from
your skull as you try to remember what vapor pressure is about, take a peek at Chapter 11.)
Increasing temperature increases vapor pressure because added heat increases the kinetic
energy of the particles in solution. With added energy, these particles stand a greater chance
of breaking free from the intermolecular forces that hold them in solution. A classic, real-life
example of temperature’s effect on gas solubility is carbonated soda. Which goes flat (loses its
dissolved carbon dioxide gas) more quickly: warm soda or cold soda?
The comparison of gas solubility in liquids with the concept of vapor pressure highlights
another important pattern: Increasing pressure increases the solubility of a gas in liquid. Just
as high pressures make it more difficult for surface-dwelling liquid molecules to escape into
vapor phase, high pressures inhibit the escape of gases dissolved in solvent. The relation-
ship between pressure and gas solubility is summarized by Henry’s Law:
Solubility = Constant × Pressure
The “constant” is Henry’s Constant, and its value depends on the gas, solvent, and tempera-
ture. A particularly useful form of Henry’s Law relates the change in solubility (S) that accom-
panies a change in pressure (P) between two different states:
S1 / P1 = S2 / P2
According to this relationship, tripling the pressure triples the gas solubility, for example.

Henry’s Constant for dinitrogen gas in
water at 293K is 0.69 × 10–3 mol L–1 atm–1.
The partial pressure of dinitrogen in air
at sea level is 0.78 atm. What is the solu-
bility of N2 in a glass of water at 20°C sit-
ting on a coffee table within a beach
house?
A.
0.54 × 10–3 mol L–1. This problem requires
the direct application of Henry’s Law.
The glass of water is at 20°C, which is
equivalent to 293K (just add 273 to any
Celsius temperature to get the Kelvin
equivalent). Because the glass sits within
a beach house, we can assume the glass
is at sea level. So, we can use the pro-
vided values for Henry’s Constant and
the partial pressure of N2.
Solubility = (0.69 × 10–3 mol L–1 atm–1) ×

Chapter 12: Dissolving into Solutions

Concentrating on Molarity 
and Percent Solutions
It seems that different solutes dissolve to different extents in different solvents in different con-
ditions. How can anybody keep track of all these differences? Chemists do so by measuring
concentration. Qualitatively, a solution with a large amount of solute is said to be concentrated.
A solution with only a small amount of solute is said to be dilute. As you may suspect, simply
describing a solution as concentrated or dilute is usually about as useful as calling it “pretty”
or naming it “Fifi.” We need numbers. Two important ways to measure concentration are molar-
ity and percent solution.
Molarity relates the amount of solute to the volume of the solution:
Molarity = (moles of solute) / (liters of solution)
To calculate molarity, you may have to use conversion factors to move between units. For
example, if you’re given the mass of a solute in grams, use the molar mass of that solute to con-
vert the given mass into moles. If you’re given the volume of solution in cm3 or some other unit,
you need to convert that volume into liters.
The units of molarity are always mol L–1. These units are often abbreviated as M and referred to
as “molar.” Thus, 0.25M KOH(aq) is described as “Point two-five molar potassium hydroxide”
and contains 0.25 moles of KOH per liter of solution. Note that this does not mean that there
are 0.25 moles KOH per liter of solvent (water, in this case) — only the final volume of the solu-
tion (solute plus solvent) is important in molarity.
Like other units, the unit of molarity can be modified by standard prefixes, as in millimolar
(mM, 10–3 mol L–1) and micromolar (µM, 10–6 mol L–1).
Percent solution is another common way to express concentration. The precise units of per-
cent solution typically depend on the phase of each component. For solids dissolved in liquids,
mass percent is usually used:
This kind of measurement is sometimes called a mass-mass percent solution because one mass is
divided by another. Very dilute concentrations (as in the concentration of a contaminant in drink-
ing water) are sometimes expressed as a special mass percent called parts per million (ppm) or
parts per billion (ppb). In these metrics, the mass of the solute is divided by the total mass of the
solution, and the resulting fraction is multiplied by 106 (ppm) or by 109 (ppb).
Sometimes, the term percent solution is used to describe concentration in terms of the final
volume of solution, instead of the final mass. For example:
 “5% Mg(OH)2” can mean 5g magnesium hydroxide in 100 mL final volume. This is a mass-
volume percent solution.
 “2% H2O2” can mean 2 mL hydrogen peroxide in 100 mL final volume. This is a volume-
volume percent solution.

Chapter 12: Dissolving into Solutions
Clearly, it’s important to pay attention to units when working with concentration. Only by
observing which units are attached to a measurement can you determine whether you are
working with molarity, mass percent, or with mass-mass, mass-volume, or volume-volume
percent solution.
Q.

H3PO4 into 642 mL final volume of solution. Be sure to use proper units. (Hint: 642 mL = 0.642L)
A.
First, calculate the molarity:
Next, calculate the mass-volume percent solution:
Note that the convention in molarity is to divide moles by liters, but the convention in mass
percent is to divide grams by milliliters. If you prefer to think only in terms of liters (not mil-
liliters), then simply consider mass percent as kilograms divided by liters.

Changing Concentrations by Making Dilutions
Real-life chemists in real-life labs don’t make every solution from scratch. Instead, they make
concentrated stock solutions and then make dilutions of those stocks as necessary for a given
experiment.
To make a dilution, you simply add a small quantity of a concentrated stock solution to an
amount of pure solvent. The resulting solution contains the amount of solute originally taken
from the stock solution, but disperses that solute throughout a greater volume. So, the final
concentration is lower; the final solution is less concentrated and more dilute.
But how do you know how much of the stock solution to use and how much of the pure sol-
vent to use? It depends on the concentration of the stock and on the concentration and
volume of the final solution you want. You can answer these kinds of pressing questions by
using the dilution equation, which relates concentration (C) and volume (V) between initial
and final states:
C1 × V1 = C2 × V2
This equation can be used with any units of concentration, provided the same units are used
throughout the calculation. Because molarity is such a common way to express concentra-
tion, the dilution equation is sometimes expressed in the following way, where M1 and M2
refer to the initial and final molarity, respectively:
M1 × V1 = M2 × V2

Q.
How would you prepare 500 mL of 
200 mM NaOH(aq), given a stock solution
of 1.5M NaOH?
A.
Add 67 mL 1.5M NaOH stock solution to
433 mL water.
Use the dilution equation: M1 × V1 = M2 × V2
The initial molarity, M1, derives from the
stock solution, and so is 1.5M. The final
molarity is the one you want in your final
solution, 200 mM, which is equivalent to
0.200M. The final volume is the one you
want for your final solution, 500 mL,
which is equivalent to 0.500L. Using
these known values, you can calculate
for the initial volume, V1:
V1 = (0.200M × 0.500L) / 1.5M = 6.7 × 10–2L
The calculated volume is equivalent to
67 mL. The final volume of the aqueous
solution is to be 500 mL. 67 mL of this
volume derives from the stock solution.
The remainder, 500 mL – 67 mL = 433 mL,
derives from pure solvent (water, in this
case). So, to prepare the solution, add 
67 mL 1.5M stock solution to 433 mL
water. Mix and enjoy.

Answers to Questions on Solutions
By this point in the chapter, your brain may feel as if it has itself dissolved. Check your
answers, boiling away that confusion to reveal crystalline bits of hard-earned knowl-
edge. In other words, make sure you know what you’re doing. Solutions are critically
important. Really.
a
The rank order from most to least soluble is: NaI, NaBr, NaCl, NaF. As the question indicates,
the larger the lattice energy is, the stronger the forces holding together the ions. Dissolving
those ions means outcompeting those forces; a solution forms when attractive solute-solvent
forces dominate over others (such as solute-solute bonds). So, salts with lower lattice energy
are typically more soluble than those with higher lattice energy.
b
Sugar should be more soluble in ethanol than in octanol. Like dissolves like. Chemists know
from experience that sugar dissolves well in water. Therefore, we expect sugar to dissolve best
in solvents that are most similar to water. Because ethanol is more miscible with water than is
octanol, we expect that ethanol has solvent properties (especially polarity) more like water
than does octanol.
c
The chemist noticed as she swirled the beaker of dissolving cesium sulfate that the beaker
was becoming noticeably warmer. This observation momentarily confused her, because it sug-
gested that the dissolution of cesium sulfate released heat, a state of affairs opposite to that
usually observed with dissolving salts. Having diagnosed the situation, she cleverly turned it
to her advantage. With typical salts, increasing temperature increases solubility in water, so
heating a dissolving mixture can promote dissolution. In the case of cesium sulfate, however,
the reverse is true: By cooling the dissolving mixture, the chemist promoted solubility of the
cesium sulfate.
d
At the high pressures to which deep-sea divers are exposed during their dives, gases become
more soluble in the blood and tissue fluids due to Henry’s Law (Solubility = Constant × Pressure).
So, when the divers do their thing at great depth, high concentrations of these gases dissolve
into the blood. If the divers rise to the surface too quickly at the end of a dive, the solubility of
these dissolved gases changes too quickly in response to the diminished pressure. This situa-
tion can lead to the formation of tiny gas bubbles in the blood and tissues. These bubbles can
be deadly.

Nothing dramatically fizzy happened when Reefus opened the first soda because that soda was
still cold from the refrigerator. As the game progressed, however, the remaining sodas warmed
to room temperature as they sat beside Reefus’s beanbag chair. Gases (like carbon dioxide) are
less soluble in warmer liquids. So, when Reefus opened the warm, fourth-quarter soda, a reser-
voir of undissolved gas burst forth from the can.

4.3 × 10–2 mol L–1. To solve this problem, use the two-state form of Henry’s Law:
S1 / P1 = S2 / P2
The initial solubility and pressure are 0.15 mol L–1 and 3.5 atm, respectively. The final pressure
is 1.0 atm. Using these known values, solve for the final solubility:
S2 = (0.15 mol L–1 / 3.5 atm) × 1.0 atm = 4.3 × 10–2 mol L–1

Again, conversion factors are the way to approach these kinds of problems. Each problem fea-
tures a certain volume of solution that contains a certain solute at a certain concentration.
Begin each calculation with the given volume. Then convert to moles by multiplying the volume
by the concentration. Finally, convert from moles to grams by multiplying by the molar mass of
the solute.

b. 9.3g HCl

28%. To calculate mass percent, you must know the mass of solute and the mass of solution.
The molarity of the solution tells you the moles of solute per volume of solution. Starting with
this information, you can convert to mass of solute by means of the gram formula mass (see
Chapter 7 for details on calculating the gram formula mass):
15.0 mol L–1 × 17.0g mol–1 = 255g L–1
So, each liter of 15.0M NH3 contains 255g NH3 solute. But how much mass does each liter of solu-
tion possess? Calculate the mass of the solution by using the density. Note that the problem
lists the density in units of milliliters, so be sure to convert to the proper units:
1.0L solution × (0.90g / 1.0 × 10–3L) = 9.0 × 102g solution
So, 255g NH3 occur in every 900g of 15.0M NH3. Now you can calculate the mass percent:
Mass percent = 100% × (255g / 900g) = 28%

The mass percent is 0.66%; the molarity is 3.7 × 10–2M. To calculate the mass percent, you
must use the estimate that 1.0 mL of water has 1.0g mass. This is a very good approximation at
room temperature, and one with which you should be familiar. So, 375 mL water has 375g mass.
Adding 2.5g glucose increases that mass to 377.5g for the final solution. Calculate the mass per-
cent as follows:
Mass % = 100% × (2.5g / 377.5g) = 0.66%
To calculate the molarity, you must know the final volume of the solution. Although adding 2.5g
to 375 mL water increases the volume from 375 mL, the increase is very small compared to the
volume of the water. So, 375 mL is a good approximation of the final volume of the solution.
Next, convert from grams of glucose to moles of glucose by means of the gram formula mass:
Moles glucose = 2.5g glucose × (1 mol / 180.2g) = 1.4 × 10–2 mol glucose
Now that you know the moles of glucose and the final volume of solution, calculating molarity
is easy:
Molarity = (1.4 × 10–2 mol glucose) / (0.375L solution) = 3.7 × 10–2M

4.29 × 10–2M. Use the dilution equation: M1 × V1 = M2 × V2
In this problem, the initial molarity is 3.00M, the initial volume is 2.50 mL (or 2.50 × 10-3L), and
the final volume is 0.175L. Use these known values to calculate the final molarity, M2:
M2 = (3.00 mol L–1 × 2.50 × 10–3L) / 0.175L = 4.29 × 10–2M

This calculation means that the original solution contained 0.500 mol (NH4)2SO4 per liter of solu-
tion. The question indicates that 1.65L of this original solution were prepared, so:

Colligative Properties

 Knowing the difference between molarity and molality

 Deducing molecular masses from boiling and freezing point changes
A
s a recently minted expert in solubility and molarity (see Chapter 12), you may be
ready to write off solutions as another chemistry topic mastered, but you, as a
chemist worth your salt, must be aware of one final piece to the puzzle. Collectively called
the colligative properties, these chemically important phenomena arise from the presence 
of solute particles in a given mass of solvent. The presence of extra particles in a formerly
pure solvent has a significant impact on some of that solvent’s characteristic properties,
such as freezing and boiling points. This chapter walks you through these colligative prop-
erties and their consequences and introduces you to a new solution property: molality. No,
that’s not a typo. Molality is an entirely new property that allows you to solve for the key
colligative properties later in this chapter.
Portioning Particles: Molality 
and Mole Fractions
While Chapter 12 focuses on molarity and its usefulness in expressing the concentration of a
solution, this chapter focuses on molality. Like the difference in their names, the difference
between molarity and molality is subtle. Take a close look at their definitions, expressed next
to one another in the following equations:
The numerators in molarity and molality calculations are identical, but their denominators
differ greatly. Molarity deals with liters of solution, while molality deals with kilograms of sol-
vent. In Chapter 12, you find out that a solution is a mixture of solvent and solute; a solvent is
the medium into which the solute is mixed.
A further subtlety to the molarity/molality confusion is how to distinguish between their
variables. The letter “m” turns out to be an overused variable in chemistry. By the time
Molarity
moles of solute
liters of solution
=
while
Molality

=

kilograms of solvent

chemists got to molality, they had already defined mass, molarity, and the mole and were
fresh out of “m’s” to use. Instead of picking another variable (or perhaps a less confusing
name that started with a nice uncommon letter like z), chemists decided to give molality the
“script” m as its variable (m). To help you avoid uttering any four-letter words when con-
fronted with this plethora of m-words and their variables, we have provided you with Table
13-1 containing all of them.

Be very careful of the wording of a molality problem when the solute is an ionic compound.
As we explain in Chapter 12, ionic compounds dissociate in aqueous solutions, splitting up
into their constituent particles. Because colligative properties depend on the total number 
of particles in solution and not the total number of particles of solute before it’s added to 
the solution, you need to take this property into account. For example, one mole of iron (III)
chloride (FeCl3) dissociates into four moles of particles in water, because water splits each
molecule of iron (III) chloride into three chlorine ions and one iron ion.
You may also occasionally be asked to calculate something called the mole fraction of a solu-
tion, which is the ratio of the number of moles of either solute or solvent in a solution to the
total number of moles of solute and solvent in the solution. By the time chemists defined this
quantity, however, they had finally acknowledged that they had too many “m” variables, and
they gave it the variable X. Of course, chemists still need to distinguish between the mole
fraction of the solute and the solvent, which unfortunately both start with the letter “s.” To
avoid further confusion, they decided to abbreviate solute and solvent as A and B respec-
tively in the general formula, although in practice, the chemical formulas of the solute and
solvent are usually written as subscripts in place of A and B. For example, the mole fraction
of sodium chloride in a compound would be written as XNaCl.
In general, the mole ratio of the solute in a solution is expressed as
Where nA is the number of moles of solute and nB is the number of moles of solvent. The mole
ratio of the solvent is then
These mole fractions are useful because they represent the ratio of solute to solution and
solvent to solution very well and give you a general understanding of how much of your solu-
tion is solute and how much is solvent.

Q.
How many grams of sodium chloride
must you add to 750g of water to make a
0.35 molal solution?
A.
7.59g NaCl. This problem gives you
molality and the mass of a solvent and
asks you to solve for the mass of solute.
Because molality involves moles and not
grams of solute, you need to first solve
for moles of solvent, and then use the
gram formula mass of sodium chloride to
solve for the number of grams of solute.
Before plugging the numbers into the
molality equation, you must also note
that the problem has given you the mass
of the solvent in grams, while the for-
mula calls for it to be in kilograms. If you
have been moving through this book
sequentially, you should be familiar
enough with unit conversions to know
that moving from grams to kilograms is
equivalent to moving the decimal point
to the left three places, but if you need a
refresher on the ins and outs of unit 
conversions, please refer to Chapter 2.
Plugging everything you know into the
equation for molality gives you
Solving for the unknown gives you 
0.26 mol NaCl in solution. Recall, how-
ever, that NaCl is an ionic compound that 
dissociates into two moles of solute for
every mole of dry NaCl added to the
solution, so this number is twice as
much as the number of moles of NaCl
added originally (0.13 mol). To finish up
the problem, you must convert this
measurement to grams using the gram
formula mass.

Too Hot to Handle: Elevating and 
Calculating Boiling Points
Calculating molality is no more or less difficult than calculating molarity, so you may be
asking yourself “why all the fuss?” Is it even worth adding another quantity and another vari-
able to memorize? Yes! While molarity is exceptionally convenient for calculating concentra-
tions and working out how to make dilutions in the most efficient way, molality is reserved
for the calculation of several important colligative properties, including boiling point eleva-
tion. Boiling point elevation refers to the tendency of a solvent’s boiling point to increase
when an impurity (a solute) is added to it. In fact, the more solute that is added, the greater
the change in the boiling point.
Boiling point elevations are directly proportional to the molality of a solution, but chemists
have found that some solvents are more susceptible to this change than others. The formula
for the change in the boiling point of a solution, therefore, contains a proportionality con-
stant, abbreviated Kb, which is a property determined experimentally and must be read from
a table such as Table 13-2. The formula for the boiling point elevation is
∆Tb = Kb × m
Note the use of the Greek letter delta (∆) in the formula to indicate that you’re calculating a
change in boiling point, not the boiling point itself. You’ll need to add this number to the boil-
ing point of the pure solvent to get the boiling point of the solution. The units of Kb are typi-
cally given in degrees Celsius per molality.

Boiling point elevations are a result of the attraction between solvent and solute particles in
a solution. Adding solute particles increases these intermolecular attractions because more
particles are around to attract one another. Solvent particles must therefore achieve a
greater kinetic energy to overcome this extra attractive force and boil, which translates into
a higher boiling point. (See Chapter 10 for full information on kinetic energy.)

Q.
What is the boiling point of a solution
containing 45.2g of menthol (C10H20O) dis-
solved in 350g of acetic acid?
A.
120.7°C. The problem asks for the boil-
ing point of the solution, so you know
that first you have to calculate the boil-
ing point elevation. This means you’re
required to know the molality of the 
solution and the Kb value of the solvent
(acetic acid). Table 13-2 tells you that the
Kb of acetic acid is 3.07. To calculate the
molality, you must convert 45.2g of men-
thol to moles.
You can now calculate the molality of the
solution, taking care to convert grams of
acetic acid to kilograms.

Now that you have molality, you can plug

change in boiling point.
Remember, however, that you’re not
quite done because the problem asks for
the boiling point of the solution, not the
change in it. Luckily, the last step is just
simple arithmetic. You must add your
∆Tb to the boiling point of pure acetic
acid which, according to Table 13-2, is
118.1°C. This gives you a final boiling
point for the solution of 118.1°C + 2.6°C =
120.7°C.

How Low Can You Go? Depressing 
and Calculating Freezing Points
The second of the important colligative properties that can be calculated from molality is
freezing point depression. Adding solute to a solvent not only raises its boiling point; it also
lowers its freezing point. This is the reason, for example, that you sprinkle salt on icy side-
walks. The salt mixes with the ice and lowers its freezing point. If this new freezing point is
lower than the outside temperature, the ice melts, eliminating the spectacular wipeouts so
common on salt-free sidewalks. The colder it is outside, the more salt is needed to melt the
ice and lower the freezing point to below the ambient temperature.
Freezing point depressions, like boiling point elevations, are calculated using a constant of
proportionality, this time abbreviated Kf. The formula therefore becomes ∆Tf = Kf × m. To cal-
culate the new freezing point of a compound, you must subtract the change in freezing point
from the freezing point of the pure solvent. Table 13-3 lists several common Kf values.

Adding an impurity to a solvent makes its liquid phase more stable through the combined
effects of boiling point elevation and freezing point depression. This is the reason why you
rarely see bodies of frozen salt water. The salt in the oceans lowers the freezing point of the
water, making the liquid phase more stable and able to sustain temperatures slightly below 0°C.
181
Chapter 13: Playing Hot and Cold: Colligative Properties
Q.
Each kilogram of seawater contains
roughly 35g of dissolved salts. Assuming
that all of these salts are sodium chlo-
ride, what is the freezing point of 
seawater?
A.
–2.23°C. Here again, you need to begin
by converting grams of salt to moles to
figure out the molality. One mole of NaCl
is equivalent to 58.4g, so 35g is equiva-
lent to 0.60 mol of NaCl. This number
must be multiplied by 2 to compensate
for the fact that sodium chloride dissoci-
ates into twice as many particles in
water, so this solution contains 1.20 mol.
Next, you must find the molality of the
solution by dividing this number of
moles by the mass of the solvent (1 kg),
giving a 1.20 molal solution. Lastly, you
must look up the Kf of water in Table 13-3
and plug all of these values into the 
equation for freezing point depression,
giving you
Because this is merely the freezing point
depression, you must subtract it from
the freezing point of the pure solute to
get 0 – 2.23°C = –2.23°C, the freezing
point of seawater.

Determining Molecular Masses with 
Boiling and Freezing Points
Just as a solid understanding of molality helps you to calculate changes in boiling and freez-
ing points, a solid understanding of ∆Tb and ∆Tf can help you determine the molecular mass
of a mystery compound being added to a known quantity of solvent. When you’re asked to
solve problems of this type, you’ll always be given the mass of the mystery solute, the mass
of solvent, and either the change in the freezing or boiling point or the new freezing or boil-
ing point itself. From this information you then follow a set of simple steps to determine the
molecular mass.
1. If you’ve been given the boiling point, calculate the ∆Tb by subtracting the boiling
point of the pure solvent from the number you were given. If you know the freezing
point, add the freezing point of the pure solvent to it to get the ∆Tf.
2. Look up the Kb or Kf of the solvent (refer back to Tables 13-2 and 13-3).
3. Solve for the molality of the solution using the equation for ∆Tb or ∆Tf.
4. Calculate the number of moles of solute in the solution by multiplying the molality
calculated in Step 3 by the number of kg of solvent you were given at the start of the
problem.
5. Divide the mass of solute you were given originally by the number of moles calcu-
lated in Step 4. This is your molecular mass, or number of grams per mole, from
which you can often guess the identity of the mystery compound.

Answers to Questions on 
Colligative Properties
You’ve tried your hand at problems on molality, boiling points, and freezing points. Are
you feeling a little hot under the collar or as cool as a cucumber? Here, we present the
answers to the practice problems for this chapter.
a
0.40m. To calculate the molality of this potassium iodide solution, you must first find out how
many moles of potassium iodide are in the solution. This requires knowing its chemical for-
mula, its gram formula mass, and how many constituent particles it will dissociate into in solu-
tion. Potassium is an alkali metal with a typical ionic charge of +1, while iodine is a halogen with
a typical ionic charge of –1. These two elements therefore combine in a one-to-one ratio, giving
the chemical formula KI (see Chapter 6 for more about naming compounds). Adding their mass
numbers gives a gram formula mass of 166.0g per mole. Dividing the given mass of potassium
iodide (50g) by this number tells you that 0.30 mol potassium iodide was added to the solution.
Because potassium iodide dissociates into two particles per mole of dry solute, multiply this
number by 2 to give 0.60 mol of solute in solution. Divide this number by the mass of water in
kilograms to give
b
1.08 kg MgI2. This problem gives you the molality and asks you to solve for the solute amount.
Plugging all the known variables into the molality equation gives
Solving this equation for the unknown number of moles of solute gives you 1.3 mol MgI2.
Because magnesium iodide dissociates into three particles per mole of dry solute in solution,
multiply this number by 3 to give 3.9 mol MgI2 in solution. The final step is to convert this to a
mass in grams by using the gram formula mass of magnesium iodide (278g per mole), giving
you 1,084g MgI2, or 1.08 kg.
c
The solution is 31% ethanol and 69% water. This problem tells you that nEtOH is 2.75 mol and
nH2O is 6.25 mol. Plugging these into the equations for the mole fraction of solute and solvent
yields
d
The solution containing sodium chloride has a boiling point of 102.3°C; the solution containing
calcium chloride has a boiling point of 103.5°C. To solve for the boiling point, you must first
solve for the molality. Start by dividing 158g NaCl by its gram formula mass (58.4g per mole),
which tells you that there are 2.71 mol of solute before it’s added to the solution. Multiply this
by 2 because each molecule of NaCl splits into two particles in solution, for a total of 5.42 mol.
Divide this by the mass of solvent (1.2 kg) to give you a molality of 4.5m. Finally, multiply this
molality by the Kb of water, 
, to give you a ∆Tb of 2.3°C. Add it to the boiling point of 
pure water (100°C) to give you a new boiling point of 102.3°C.

If the same number of moles of calcium chloride (CaCl2) were added, on the other hand, it
would dissociate into three particles per mole in solution, giving 2.71 mol × 3 = 8.13 mol of
solute in solution. As with the sodium chloride solution, divide this by the mass of solvent 
(1.2 kg) to get 6.8m, and multiply by the Kb of water (
) to get a ∆Tb of 3.5°C. This is
a difference of more than 1 degree! The difference arises because colligative properties such as
boiling point elevation depend only on the number of particles in solution.
e
79.3g C16H10N2O2. This problem requires a little bit more thought than the others you’ve seen
before because it requires you to solve a boiling point elevation problem backwards. You’re
given the boiling point of the solution, so the first thing to do is to solve for the ∆Tb of the solu-
tion. You do this by subtracting the boiling point of pure ethanol from the given boiling point of
the impure solution. This gives you
∆Tb= 79.2°C – 78.4°C = 0.8°C
After looking up the Kb of ethanol (
), the only unknown in your ∆Tb equation is the 
molality. Solving for this gives you
Now that you know the molality, you can extract the number of moles of solute.
Lastly, translate this mole count into a mass by multiplying by the gram molecular mass of
C16H10N2O2 (262g per mole), giving you your final answer of 79.3g C16H10N2O2.
f
5.00 kg C2H6O2. Here you’ve been given a freezing point depression of 15.0°C and have been
asked to backsolve for the number of grams of antifreeze required to make it happen. Begin by
solving for the molality of the solution by plugging all the known quantities into your freezing
point depression equation and solving for molality.
Now solve for the number of moles of the solvent ethylene glycol (antifreeze).
Finally, translate this mole count into a mass by multiplying by the gram molecular mass of
C2H6O2 (62.0g per mole), giving you your final answer of 5.00 kg C2H6O2. Lowering the freezing point
of water by such a significant amount requires a solution that is one-third antifreeze by mass!
g
–114.4°C. First calculate the molality of the solution by converting the mass of silver into a
mole count (15g × (1 mol/108g) = 0.14 mol) and dividing it by the mass of ethanol in kilograms,
giving you 0.093m. Then multiply this molality by the Kf of ethanol (
), giving you a ∆Tf

ost people don’t like waiting. And nobody likes waiting for nothing. Research has ten-
tatively concluded that chemists are people, too. It follows that chemists don’t like to
wait, and if they must wait, they’d prefer to get something for their trouble.
To address these concerns, chemists study things like rate and equilibrium.
 Rates tell chemists how long they’ll have to wait for a reaction to occur.
 Equilibrium tells chemists how much product they’ll get if they wait long enough.
These two concepts are completely separate. There’s no connection between how produc-
tive a reaction can be and how long it takes for that reaction to proceed. In other words,
chemists have good days and bad days, like everyone else. At least they have a little bit of
theory to help them make sense of these things. In this chapter, you get an overview of this
theory. Don’t wait. Read on.
Measuring Rates
So, you’ve got this beaker, and a reaction is going on inside of it. Is the reaction a fast one or a
slow one? How fast or how slow? How can you tell? These are questions about rates. You can
measure a reaction rate by measuring how fast a reactant disappears or by measuring how fast
a product appears. If the reaction occurs in solution, the molar concentration of reactant or
product changes over time, so rates are often expressed in units of molarity per second (M s–1).
For the following reaction,
A + B →C
you can measure the reaction rate by measuring the decrease in the concentration of either
reactant A (or B) or the increase in the concentration of product C over time:
Rate = –d[A] / dt = d[C] / dt
In these kinds of equations, d is math-speak for a change in the amount of something at any
given moment. If you plot the concentration of product against the reaction time, for example,
you might get a curve like the one shown in Figure 14-1. Reactions usually occur most quickly

at the beginning of a reaction, when the concentration of products is the lowest and the con-
centration of reactants is highest. The precise rate at any given moment of the reaction is
called the instantaneous rate and is equal to the slope of a line drawn tangent to the curve.
Clearly, the rate can change as the concentration of reactants and/or products changes. So,
you’d expect that any equation for describing the rate of a reaction like the one shown in
Figure 14-1 would include some variable for the concentration of reactant. You’d be right.
Equations that relate the rate of a reaction to the concentration of some species (which can
mean either reactant or product) in solution are called rate laws. The exact form a rate law
assumes depends on the reaction involved. Countless research studies have described the
intricacies of rate in chemical reactions. Here, we focus on rate laws for simpler reactions. In
general, rate laws take the form:
Rate = k [reactant A]m[reactant B]n
The rate law shown describes a reaction whose rate depends on the concentration of two
reactants, A and B. Other rate laws for other reactions may include factors for greater or fewer
reactants. In this equation, k is the rate constant, a number that must be experimentally meas-
ured for different reactions. The exponents m and n are called reaction orders, and must also
be measured for different reactions. A reaction order reflects the impact of a change in con-
centration in overall rate. If m > n, then a change in the concentration of A affects the rate
more than does changing the concentration of B. The sum, m + n, is the overall reaction order.
Some simple kinds of reaction rate laws crop up frequently, so they’re worth your notice:
 Zero-order reactions: Rates for these reactions don’t depend on the concentration of
any species, but simply proceed at a characteristic rate:
Rate = k

188
Part III: Examining Changes in Terms of Energy 

 First-order reactions: Rates for these reactions typically depend on the concentration
of a single species:
Rate = k[A]
 Second-order reactions: Rates for these reactions may depend on the concentration of
two species, or may have second-order dependence on the concentration of a single
species (or some intermediate combination):
Rate = k[A][B]
or
Rate = k[A]2
Measuring rates can help you figure out mechanism, the molecular details by which a reac-
tion takes place. The slowest step is typically the one that contributes most to the observed
rate — it’s the rate determining step. By measuring reaction rates under varying conditions,
you can discover a lot about the chemical nature of the rate determining step. Be forewarned,
however: You can never use rates to prove a reaction mechanism; you can only use rates to
disprove incorrect mechanisms.

Q.
Consider the following two reactions and
their associated rate laws:
Reaction 1:
A + B →C
Rate = k[A]2
Reaction 2:
D + E →F + 2G
Rate = k[D][E]
a. What is the overall reaction order for
Reaction 1 and for Reaction 2?
b. For Reaction 1, how will the rate
change if the concentration of A is dou-
bled? How will the rate change if the
concentration of B is doubled?
c. For Reaction 2, how will the rate
change if the concentration of D is dou-
bled? How will the rate change if the
concentration of E is doubled?
d. What is the relationship between the
rates of change in [A], [B], and [C]?
What is the relationship between the
rates of change in [D], [E], [F], and [G]?
A.
Based on the given reactions and their
associated rate laws, here are answers 
to the questions about reaction order
and rate:
a. Both reactions are second order,
because adding the individual reaction
orders yields “2” in each case.
b. If [A] is doubled, the rate law predicts
that the rate will quadruple, because 
22 = 4. If [B] is doubled, the rate won’t
change because [B] doesn’t appear in
the rate law.
c. If [D] is doubled or if [E] is doubled,
the rate law predicts that the rate will
also double because 21 = 2.
d. Rate = d[A] / dt = d[B] / dt = –d[C] / dt
and
Rate = d[D] / dt = d[E] / dt = –d[F] / dt =
–0.5d[G] / dt
In Reaction 1, reactants A and B are
consumed to make product C, so the
rates of change in the concentration of
A and B will have the opposite sign as
the rate of change in C (you could
swap positive and negative values
throughout the rate equation, and the
answer would still be correct). In
Reaction 2, the same guidelines apply
for positive/negative signs, but there’s
an added wrinkle: 2 moles of product
G are made for every 1 mole made of
product F, and for every 1 mole con-
sumed of reactants D and E. So, the
rate of change in D, E, and F is one half
the rate of change in G, as indicated
by the coefficient of 0.5.

Focusing on Factors that Affect Rates
Despite the impression given by their choice in clothing, chemists are finicky, tinkering
types. They usually want to change reaction rates to suit their own needs. What can affect
rates, and why? Temperature, concentration, and catalysts influence rate as follows:
 Reaction rates tend to increase with temperature. This trend results from the fact
that reactants must collide with one another to have the chance to react. If reactants
collide with the right orientation and with enough energy, the reaction can occur. So,
the greater the number of collisions, and the greater the energy of those collisions, 
the more actual reacting takes place. An increase in temperature corresponds to an
increase in the average kinetic energy of the particles in a reacting mixture — the parti-
cles move faster, colliding more frequently and with greater energy. (See Chapter 10 for
more about kinetic energy.)
 Increasing concentration tends to increase reaction rate. The reason for this trend
also has to do with collisions. Higher concentrations mean the reactant particles are
closer to one another, so they undergo more collisions and have a greater chance of
reacting. Increasing the concentration of reactants may mean dissolving more of those
reactants in solution. Some reactants aren’t completely dissolved, but come in larger,
undissolved particles. In these cases, smaller particles lead to faster reactions. Smaller
particles expose more surface area, making a greater portion of the particle available
for reaction.
 Catalysts increase reaction rates. Catalysts don’t themselves become chemically
changed, and they don’t alter the amount of product a reaction can eventually produce
(the yield). Catalysts can operate in many different ways, but all of those ways have to
do with decreasing activation energy, the energetic hill reactants must climb to reach a
transition state, the highest-energy state along a reaction pathway. Lower activation
energies mean faster reactions. Figure 14-2 shows a reaction progress diagram, the ener-
getic pathway reactants must traverse to become products. The figure also shows how
a catalyst affects reactions, by lowering the activation energy without altering the ener-
gies of the reactants or products.

Q.
Consider the following reaction: 
H2(g) + Cl2(g) →2HCl(g)
If 1 mol H2 reacts with 1 mol Cl2 to form 
2 mol HCl, does the reaction occur more
rapidly in a 5L or a 10L vessel? Does it
occur more rapidly at 273K or 293K?
Why?
A.
The reaction occurs more rapidly in the
5L vessel because the concentration of
reactant molecules is higher when they
occupy the smaller volume. At higher
concentration, more collisions occur
between reactant molecules. At higher
temperatures, particles move with greater
energy, which also produces more colli-
sions, and collisions of greater force. So,
the reaction occurs more rapidly at 293K.

Here is a simplified reaction equation for
the combustion of gunpowder:
10KNO3 + 3S + 8C →2K2CO3 + 3K2SO4 + 
6CO2 + 5N2
In the 1300s, powdersmiths began to
process raw gunpowder by using a method
called corning. Corning involves adding
liquid to gunpowder to make a paste,
pressing the paste into solid cakes, and
forcing the cakes through a sieve to pro-
duce grains of defined size. These grains
are both larger and more consistently sized
than the original grains of powder. Explain
the advantages of corned gunpowder from
the perspective of chemical kinetics.

5.
Consider the following reaction: A →B
To progress from reactant to product, reac-
tant A must pass through a high-energy
transition state, A*. Imagine that reaction
conditions are changed in such a way that
the energy of A is increased, the energy of
B is decreased, and the energy of A*
remains unchanged. Does the change in
conditions result in a faster reaction? Why
or why not?
Solve It

Measuring Equilibrium
Figure 14-3 shows a reaction progress diagram like the one shown in Figure 14-2, but high-
lights the difference in energy between reactants and products. This difference is completely
independent of activation energy, which we discuss in the previous section. Although activa-
tion energy controls the rate of a reaction, the difference in energy between reactants and
products determines the extent of a reaction — how much reactant will have converted to
product when the reaction is complete.
A reaction that has produced as much product as it ever will is said to be at equilibrium.
Equilibrium doesn’t mean that no more chemistry is occurring; rather, equilibrium means
that the rate at which reactant converts to product equals the rate at which product con-
verts back into reactant. So, the overall concentrations of reactants and products no longer
change.
Two key ideas emerge:
 First, the equilibrium position of a reaction (the extent to which the reaction proceeds)
can be characterized by the concentrations of reactants and products, because these
concentrations no longer change.
 Second, the equilibrium position of a reaction is intimately connected to the difference
in energy between reactants and products.
These two ideas are expressed by two important equations, which we cover in the upcoming
sections.

Chapter 14: Exploring Rate and Equilibrium

The equilibrium constant
First, a parameter called Keq, the equilibrium constant, describes the equilibrium position of a
reaction in terms of the concentration of reactants and products. For the following reaction,
aA + bB ↔cC + dD
The equilibrium constant is calculated as follows:
In general, concentrations of the products are divided by the concentrations of the reactants.
In the case of gas phase reactions, partial pressures are used instead of molar concentrations.
Multiple product or reactant concentrations are multiplied. Each concentration is raised to an
exponent equal to its stoichiometric coefficient in the balanced reaction equation.
Very favorable reactions (ones that progress on their own) produce a lot of product, so they
have Keq values much larger than 1. Very unfavorable reactions (ones that require an input of
energy) convert very little reactant into product, so they have Keq values between 0 and 1. In
a reaction with Keq = 1, the amount of product equals the amount of reactant at equilibrium.
Note that you can only calculate Keq by using concentrations measured at equilibrium.
Concentrations measured before a reaction reaches equilibrium are used to calculate a reac-
tion quotient, Q:
If Q < Keq, the reaction will progress “to the right,” making more product. If Q > Keq, the reac-
tion will shift “to the left,” converting product into reactant. If Q = Keq, the reaction is at 
equilibrium.
Free energy
The second key equation having to do with equilibrium relates the Keq to the difference in
energy between reactants and products. The particular form of energy important in this rela-
tionship is free energy, G. The difference in free energy between product and reactant states
is ∆G = Gproduct – Greactant. The relationship between free energy and equilibrium is
∆G = –RT ln Keq

In these equations, R is the gas constant (0.08206L atm K–1 mol–1 or 8.314L kPa K–1 mol–1; see
Chapter 11 for more information), T is temperature, and ln refers to the natural logarithm, log
base e. The equation is typically true for reactions that occur with no change in temperature
or pressure.
Favorable reactions possess negative values for ∆G and unfavorable reactions possess posi-
tive values for ∆G. Energy must be added to drive an unfavorable reaction forward. If the ∆G
for a set of reaction conditions is 0, the reaction is at equilibrium.
The free energy change for a reaction, ∆G, arises from the interplay of two other parameters,
the enthalpy change, ∆H, and the entropy change, ∆S. A detailed discussion of enthalpy and
entropy is well beyond the scope of this book. As a rough approximation, you can think of
enthalpy as the energy associated with order in the system, and entropy as the energy asso-
ciated with disorder in the system. Negative changes in enthalpy are favorable, as are posi-
tive changes in entropy. Overall, then:

Checking Out Factors that Disrupt Equilibrium
After a chemical system has reached equilibrium, that equilibrium can be disrupted, or per-
turbed. Think of systems at equilibrium as people who have finally found their easy chair at
the end of a long day. You may rouse them to take out the trash, but they’ll return to the easy
chair at the first opportunity. This concept is more or less the idea behind Le Chatelier’s
Principle: The equilibrium of a perturbed system shifts in the direction that minimizes the
perturbation. Perturbations include changes in concentration, pressure, and temperature.
 Concentration: If a system is at equilibrium, Q = Keq. Adding or removing reactant or
product disrupts the equilibrium such that Q < Keq or Q > Keq. The equilibrium reasserts
itself in response.
• If reactant is added or product is removed, reactant converts into product.
• If product is added or reactant is removed, product converts into reactant.
Either way, chemistry occurs until Q = Keq once more. The equilibrium shifts to oppose
the perturbation.
 Pressure: Reactions that include gases as reactants and/or products are particularly
sensitive to pressure perturbation. If pressure is suddenly increased, equilibrium shifts
toward the side of the reaction that contains fewer moles of gas, thereby decreasing
pressure. If pressure is suddenly decreased, equilibrium shifts toward the side of the
reaction that contains more moles of gas, thereby increasing pressure. Consider the 
following reaction:
N2(g) + 3H2(g) ↔2NH3(g)
A given amount of mass on the reactant side of the equation (as N2 and H2) corre-
sponds to double the moles of gas as the same mass on the product side (as NH3).
Imagine that the system is at equilibrium at a low pressure. Now imagine that the pres-
sure suddenly increases, perturbing that equilibrium. Reactant (N2 and H2) converts to
product (NH3) so the total moles of gas decrease, thereby lowering the pressure.
If the system suddenly shifts to lower pressure, NH3 converts to N2 and H2, so the total
moles of gas increase, thereby raising the pressure. The equilibrium shifts to oppose
the perturbation.
 Temperature: Reactions that absorb or give off heat (that is, most reactions) can be
perturbed from equilibrium by changes in temperature. The easiest way to under-
stands this behavior is to explicitly include heat as a reactant or product in the reac-
tion equation:
A + B ↔C + heat
Imagine that this reaction is at equilibrium. Now imagine that the temperature sud-
denly increases. Product C absorbs heat, converting to reactants A and B. Because the
heat “product” has been decreased, the temperature of the system decreases.
If the temperature suddenly shifts down from equilibrium, reactants A and B convert to
product C, releasing heat. The released heat increases the temperature of the system.
The equilibrium shifts to oppose the perturbation.

Answers to Questions on Rate and
Equilibrium
You may have raced through these problems, or you may have moved at the speed 
of a dead snail in winter. But rate is separate from equilibrium — whatever your pace,
you’ve made it this far. Now shift in opposition to any perturbing problems; check your
work.

The reaction equation makes clear that each mole of methane reactant corresponds to 1 mole
of carbon dioxide product and 2 moles of water product. So:
d[CH4] / dt = –d[CO2] / dt = –0.5d[H2O] / dt
This means that the disappearance of 2.79 mol s–1 of methane corresponds to the appearance of
2.79 mol s–1 of CO2 and the appearance of 2 × 2.79 = 5.58 mol s–1 of H2O. The concentration of
methane changes at half the rate of water, so the concentration of water changes at twice the
rate of methane.
b
The observations are consistent with the rate law, Rate = k[A]2[B]. Tripling [A] increased the
rate ninefold, and 32 = 9. Doubling [B] doubled the rate, and 21 = 2. The overall reaction order
(3) is the sum of the individual reaction orders (the exponents on the individual reactant con-
centrations), 2 + 1 = 3.
c
Doubling the concentration of either reactant (D or E) doubles the rate. So, the data are consis-
tent with the rate law, Rate = k[D][E]. Solve for k by substituting known values of rate [D] and
[E] from any of the trial reactions:
k = Rate / ([D][E]) = 4.8 × 106M s–1 / (2.7 × 10–2M × 2.7 × 10–2M) = 6.6 × 109M –1 s–1.
Use this calculated value of k to determine the rate in the presence of 1.3 × 10–2M reactant D and
0.92 × 10–2M reactant E:
Rate = (6.6 × 109M –1 s–1)(1.3 × 10–2M)(0.92 × 10–2M) = 7.9 × 105M s–1
d
The corning process converts gunpowder from a finely divided powder of undefined particle
size into larger particles of defined size. Because the corned particles are larger, combustion
occurs more slowly. Corned gunpowder is less likely to explode accidentally than is a fine dust
of gunpowder. Because the corned particles are all the same size, combustion occurs at a pre-
dictable rate, which is convenient for the user.
e
The change in conditions does result in a faster rate. Rate is limited by activation energy, the
difference in energy between reactant (A) and the transition state (A*). If the energy of A is
raised and the energy of A* remains constant, then the difference in energy (the activation
energy) becomes smaller, and lower activation energies result in faster reactions. The decrease
in the energy of product B has no bearing on the rate because it has no effect on the activation
energy for the A →B reaction — although it would affect the rate of the reverse reaction, 
B →A.

Here are the answers regarding equilibrium in the reaction, N2(g) + O2(g) ↔2NO(g).
a. The Keq = (2.63 × 10–7 atm)2 / [(4.76 × 10–2 atm)(9.82 × 10–3 atm)] = 1.48 × 10–10.
b. Q = (2.63 × 10–7 atm)2 / [(4.76 × 10–2 atm)(3.74 × 10–2 atm)] = 3.89 × 10–11. Because Q < Keq, the
reaction would proceed to the right, converting reactant into product.

a. Q = [(78.9 mM)(443 mM)3] / [(273 mM)2(34.7 mM)2] = 76.4
b. If Keq = 1.85 × 102, then Q < Keq, so the reaction will continue to convert reactant to product.
h
Here are the answers regarding equilibrium in the reaction, A + B ↔2C.
a. ∆G = ∆H – T∆S. Solving for the entropy change, we obtain:
∆S = (∆H –∆G) / T = [12.3 kJ mol–1 – (–25.8 kJ mol–1)] / 273K = 0.140 kJ mol–1 K–1. At 273K, the
contribution of entropy, T∆S, is (0.140 kJ mol–1 K–1)(273K) = 38.1 kJ mol–1. This favorable
entropy change drives the reaction despite an unfavorable enthalpy change.
b.
c. [B] = [C]2 / ([A]Keq) = (11.7M)2 / [(0.744M)(11.4)] = 16.1M
i
Here are answers regarding equilibrium in the combustion of octane.
a. Increasing the partial pressure of oxygen increases the concentration of a reactant, so the
system shifts to the right, converting more mass into product.
b. Increasing temperature is tantamount to adding heat “product,” so the system shifts to the
left, counteracting the increase in heat content.
c. As the gases expand within the cylinder, volume increases so pressure decreases (see
Chapter 11 for more about this relationship). The decrease in pressure shifts the equilibrium
to the right because the product side corresponds to a greater number of moles of gas for 
a given mass. By increasing total moles of gas, the system shifts to counteract the decrease 
in pressure.
j
Here are answers regarding equilibrium in the reaction, nX + 2O2 →4Y.
a. Higher temperatures (more heat) shift the reaction away from product, toward reactant. So,
heat must be a product. In other words, the reaction is exothermic.
b. Increasing pressure leads to lower equilibrium yield. So, the total moles of gas in the product
state must exceed the total moles of gas in the reactant state. In other words, 4 > n + 2. So, the
only plausible possibility offered for the value of n is 1.

nergy shifts between many forms. It may be tricky to detect, but energy is always con-
served. Sometimes energy reveals itself as heat. Thermodynamics explores how energy
moves from one form to another. Thermochemistry investigates changes in heat that accom-
pany chemical reactions. In this chapter, we delve into the particulars of thermodynamics
and thermochemistry.
Working with the Basics of Thermodynamics
To understand how thermochemistry is done, you need to first understand how the particu-
lar form of energy called heat fits into the overall dance of energy and matter.
To study energy, it helps to divide the universe into two parts, the system and the surround-
ings. For chemists, the system may consist of the contents of a beaker or tube. This is an
example of a closed system, one which allows exchange of energy with the surroundings, but
doesn’t allow exchange of matter. Closed systems are common in chemistry. Though energy
may move between system and surroundings, the total energy of the universe is constant.
Energy itself is divided into potential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE).
 Potential energy is energy due to position. Chemical energy is a kind of potential energy,
arising from the positions of particles within systems.
 Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. Thermal energy is a kind of kinetic energy, aris-
ing from the movement of particles within systems.
The total internal energy of a system (E) is the sum of its potential and kinetic energies. When
a system moves between two states (as it does in a chemical reaction), the internal energy

may change as the system exchanges energy with the surroundings. The difference in energy
(∆E) between the initial and final states derives from heat (q) added to or lost from the
system, and from work (w) done by the system or on the system.
We can summarize these energy explanations with the help of a couple of handy formulas:
Etotal = KE + PE
∆E = Efinal – Einitial = q + w
What kind of “work” can atoms and molecules do in a chemical reaction? One kind that is
easy to understand is pressure-volume work. Consider the following reaction:
CaCO3(s) →CaO(s) + CO2(g)
Solid calcium carbonate decomposes into solid calcium oxide and carbon dioxide gas. At
constant pressure (P), this reaction proceeds with a change in volume (V). The added
volume comes from the production of carbon dioxide gas. As gas is made, it expands, push-
ing against the surroundings. The carbon dioxide gas molecules do work as they push into a
greater volume:
w = –P∆V
The negative sign in this equation means that the system loses internal energy because of
the work it does on the surroundings. If the surroundings did work on the system, thereby
decreasing the system’s volume, then the system would gain internal energy.
So, pressure-volume work can partly account for changes in internal energy during a reac-
tion. When pressure-volume work is the only kind of work involved, any remaining changes
come from heat flow. Enthalpy (H) corresponds to the heat content of a closed system at con-
stant pressure. An enthalpy change (∆H) in such a system corresponds to heat flow. The
enthalpy change equals the change in internal energy minus the energy used to perform
pressure-volume work:
∆H = ∆E – (–P∆V) = ∆E + P∆V
Like E, P, and V, H is a state function, meaning that its value has only to do with the state of
the system, and nothing to do with how the system got to that state. Heat (q) is not a state
function, but is simply a form of energy that flows from warmer objects to cooler objects.
Now breathe. The practical consequences of all this theory are the following:
 Chemical reactions usually involve the flow of energy in the form of heat, q.
 Chemists monitor changes in heat by measuring changes in temperature.
 At constant pressure, the change in heat content equals the change in enthalpy, ∆H.
 Knowing ∆H values helps to explain and predict chemical behavior.

Part III: Examining Changes in Terms of Energy 

Holding Heat: Heat Capacity and Calorimetry
Heat is a form of energy that flows from warmer objects to cooler objects. But how much
heat can an object hold? If objects have the same heat content, does that mean they’re the
same temperature? You can measure different temperatures, but how do these temperatures
relate to heat flow? These kinds of questions revolve around the concept of heat capacity, the
amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a system by 1K.
It takes longer to boil a large pot of water than a small pot of water. With the burner set on
high, the same amount of heat flows into each pot, but the larger pot of water has a higher
heat capacity. So, it takes more heat to increase the temperature of the larger pot.
You’ll encounter heat capacity in different forms, each of which is useful in different scenarios.
Any system has a heat capacity. But how can you best compare heat capacities between chemi-
cal systems? You use molar heat capacity or specific heat capacity (or just specific heat). Molar
heat capacity is simply the heat capacity of 1 mole of a substance. Specific heat capacity is

Q.
Gas is heated within a sealed cylinder. The
heat causes the gas to expand, pushing a
movable piston outward to increase the
volume of the cylinder to 4.63L. The ini-
tial and final pressures of the system are
both 1.15 atm. The gas does 304J of work
on the piston. What was the initial volume
of the cylinder? (Note: 101.3J = 1 L·atm)
A.
2.02L. You’re given an amount of work, 
a constant pressure, and the knowledge
that the volume of the system changes.
So, the equation to use here is w = –P∆V =
–P(Vfinal – Vinitial). Because the system does
work on the piston (and not the other
way around), the sign of w is negative.
Substituting your known values into the
equation gives you:
–304J = –1.15 atm (4.63L – Vinitial)
Converting joules to liter-atmospheres
yields:
–3.00 L·atm = –1.15 atm (4.63L – Vinitial)
Solving for Vinitial gives you:
Vinitial = (5.32 L·atm – 3.00 L·atm) / 1.15
atm = 2.02L

simply the heat capacity of 1 gram of a substance. How do you know whether you’re dealing
with heat capacity, molar heat capacity, or specific heat capacity? Look at the units.
Heat capacity: Energy / K
Molar heat capacity:
Energy / (mol·K)
Specific heat capacity: Energy / (g·K)
Fine, but what are the units of energy? Well, that depends. The SI unit of energy is the joule
(J) (see Chapter 2 for more about the International System of units), but the units of calorie
(cal) and liter-atmosphere (L·atm) are also used. Here’s how the joule, the calorie, and the
liter-atmosphere are related:
 1J = 0.2390 cal
 101.3J = 1 L·atm
Note that in everyday language, a “calorie” actually refers to a “Calorie” or a kilocalorie — a
calorie of cheesecake is 1,000 times larger than you think it is.
Calorimetry is a family of techniques that puts all this thermochemical theory to use. When
chemists do calorimetry, they initiate a reaction within a defined system, and then measure
any temperature change that occurs as the reaction progresses. There are a few variations
on this theme.
 Constant-pressure calorimetry directly measures an enthalpy change (∆H) for a reaction
because it monitors heat flow at constant pressure: ∆H = qP
Typically, heat flow is observed through changes in the temperature of a reaction solu-
tion. If a reaction warms a solution, then that reaction must have released heat into the
solution. In other words, the change in heat content of the reaction (qreaction) has the
same magnitude as the change in heat content for the solution (qsolution) but has oppo-
site sign: qsolution = –qreaction
So, measuring qsolution allows you to calculate qreaction, but how can you measure qsolution? You
do so by measuring the difference in temperature (∆T) before and after the reaction:
qsolution = (mass of solution) × (specific heat of solution) × ∆T
In other words, q = mCP∆T.
Here, “m” is the mass of the solution and CP is the specific heat capacity of the solution
at constant pressure. ∆T is equal to Tfinal – Tinitial.
When you use this equation, be sure that all your units match. For example, if your CP
has units of J g–1 K–1, don’t expect to calculate heat flow in kilocalories.
 Constant-volume calorimetry directly measures a change in internal energy (∆E, not ∆H)
for a reaction because it monitors heat flow at constant volume. Often, ∆E and ∆H are
very similar values.
A common variety of constant-volume calorimetry is bomb calorimetry, a technique in
which a reaction (often, a combustion reaction) is triggered within a sealed vessel
called a bomb. The vessel is immersed in a water bath of known volume. The tempera-
ture of the water is measured before and after the reaction. Because the heat capacity
of the water and the calorimeter are known, you can calculate heat flow from the
change in temperature.

At some point, all laboratory chemists
learn the same hard lesson: Hot glass looks
just like cold glass. Heath discovered this
when he picked up a hot beaker someone
left on his bench. At the moment Heath
grasped the 413K glass beaker, 567J of heat
flowed out of the beaker and into his hand.
The glass of the beaker has a heat capacity
of 0.84J g–1 K–1. If the beaker was 410K the
instant Heath dropped it, then what is the
collective mass of the shards of beaker
now littering the lab floor?

Absorbing and Releasing Heat: Endothermic
and Exothermic Reactions
So, as you find out in the previous section, you can monitor heat flow by measuring changes
in temperature. But what does any of this have to do with chemistry? Chemical reactions
transform both matter and energy. Though reaction equations usually list only the matter
components of a reaction, you can consider heat energy as a reactant or product as well.
When chemists are interested in heat flow during a reaction (and when the reaction is run at
constant pressure), they may list an enthalpy change (∆H) to the right of the reaction equa-
tion. As we explain in the previous section, at constant pressure, heat flow equals ∆H.
qP = ∆H = Hfinal – Hinitial
If the ∆H listed for a reaction is negative, then that reaction releases heat as it proceeds —
the reaction is exothermic. If the ∆H listed for the reaction is positive, then that reaction
absorbs heat as it proceeds — the reaction is endothermic. In other words, exothermic reac-
tions release heat as a product, and endothermic reactions consume heat as a reactant.
The sign of the ∆H tells us the direction of heat flow, but what about the magnitude? The
coefficients of a chemical reaction represent molar equivalents (see Chapter 8 for details).
So, the value listed for the ∆H refers to the enthalpy change for one molar equivalent of the
reaction. Here’s an example:
CH4(g) + 2O2(g) →CO2(g) + 2H2O(g)
∆H = –802 kJ
The reaction equation shown describes the combustion of methane, a reaction you might
expect to release heat. The enthalpy change listed for the reaction confirms this expectation:
For each mole of methane that combusts, 802 kJ of heat are released. The reaction is highly
exothermic. Based on the stoichiometry of the equation, you can also say that 802 kJ of 
heat are released for every 2 moles of water produced. (Flip to Chapter 9 for the scoop on
stoichiometry.)
So, reaction enthalpy changes (or reaction “heats”) are a useful way to measure or predict
chemical change. But they’re just as useful in dealing with physical changes, like freezing and

melting, evaporating and condensing, and others. For example, water (like most substances)
absorbs heat as it melts (or fuses) and as it evaporates:
Molar enthalpy of fusion:
∆Hfus = 6.01 kJ
Molar enthalpy of vaporization: ∆Hvap = 40.68 kJ
The same sorts of rules apply to enthalpy changes listed for chemical changes and physical
changes. Here’s a summary of the rules that apply to both:
 The heat absorbed or released by a process is proportional to the moles of sub-
stance that undergo that process. Two moles of combusting methane release twice as
much heat as does 1 mole of combusting methane.
 Running a process in reverse produces heat flow of the same magnitude but of
opposite sign as running the forward process. Freezing 1 mole of water releases the
same amount of heat that is absorbed when 1 mole of water melts.

the oxidation of hydrogen gas to form

A.
1.08 × 103 kJ. First, recognize that the

of the electrolysis reaction, so you must
reverse its sign from –572 to 572. Second,
recall that heats of reaction are propor-
tional to the amount of substance react-

Summing Heats with Hess’s Law
For the chemist, Hess’s Law is a valuable tool for dissecting heat flow in complicated, multi-
step reactions. For the confused or disgruntled chemistry student, Hess’s Law is a breath of
fresh air. In essence, the law confirms that heat behaves the way we’d like it to behave: pre-
dictably.
Imagine that the product of one reaction serves as the reactant for another reaction. Now
imagine that the product of the second reaction serves as the reactant for a third reaction.
What you have is a set of coupled reactions, connected in series like the cars of a train:
A →B
and
B →C
and
C →D
So,
A →B →C →D
You can think of these three reactions adding up to one big reaction, A →D. What is the over-
all enthalpy change associated with this reaction (∆HA→D)? Here’s the good news:
∆HA→D = ∆HA→B + ∆HB→C + ∆HC→D
Enthalpy changes are additive. But the good news gets even better. Imagine that you’re
trying to figure out the total enthalpy change for the following multistep reaction:
X →Y →Z
Here’s a wrinkle: For technical reasons, you can’t measure this enthalpy change (∆HX→Z)
directly, but must calculate it from tabulated values for ∆HX→Y and ∆HY→Z. No problem, right?
You simply look up the tabulated values and add them. But here’s another wrinkle: when you
look up the tabulated values, you find the following:
∆HX→Y = –37.5 kJ mol–1
∆HZ→Y = –10.2 kJ mol–1
Gasp! You need ∆HY→Z, but you’re provided only ∆HZ→Y! Relax. As we note in the previous
section, the enthalpy change for a reaction has the same magnitude and opposite sign as
the reverse reaction. So, if ∆HZ→Y = –10.2 kJ mol–1, then ∆HY→Z = 10.2 kJ mol–1. It really is that
simple. So,
∆HX→Z = ∆HX→Y + (–∆HZ→Y) = –37.5 kJ mol–1 + 10.2 kJ mol–1 = –27.3 kJ mol–1
Thanks be to Hess.

78.8 kJ decrease. You’re given a constant pressure, an amount of heat, a change in volume, and
the knowledge that there’s been an change in internal energy. Changes in heat content at con-
stant pressure are equivalent to a change in enthalpy. So, the equation to use here is:
∆H = ∆E + P∆V
To do the math properly, you must make sure that all of your units match, so temporarily con-
vert the given heat energy from kJ to L·atm: 75.0 kJ = 7.50 × 104J = 7.40 × 102 L·atm.
Because heat is released from the system, the change in enthalpy (∆H) is negative. Substitute
your known values into the equation:
–7.40 × 102 L·atm = ∆E + 3.00 atm (20.0L – 7.50L)
Solving for ∆E gives you –778 L·atm, which is equivalent to –78.8 kJ. Because the sign is nega-
tive, the internal energy of the system decreases by 78.8 kJ.
b
473K. The key to setting up this problem is to realize that whatever heat flows out of the lead
flows into the water, so: qlead = –qwater. Calculate each quantity of heat by using q = mCP∆T. Recall
that ∆T = Tfinal – Tinitial. The unknown in the problem is the initial temperature of lead.
qlead = (375g)(0.127J g–1 K–1)(297K – Tinitial)
To calculate qwater, you must first calculate the mass of 0.500L water by using the density of
water: 0.500L × (1.00 kg L–1) = 0.500 kg = 500g
qwater = (500g)(4.18J g–1 K–1)(297K – 293K) = 8.36 × 103J
Setting qlead equal to –qwater and solving for Tinitial yields 473K:
(375g)(0.127J g–1 K–1)(297K – Tinitial) = –8.36 × 103J
297K – Tinitial = –176K
Tinitial = 473K
c
2.3 × 102g. To solve this problem, apply q = mCP∆T to the beaker. The unknown is the mass of
the beaker, m. Because heat flowed out of the beaker, the sign of q must be negative.
–576J = (m)(0.84J g–1 K–1)(410K – 413K)
Solving for m yields 2.3 × 102g.
d
303K. Solve this problem in two parts. First, calculate the amount of heat released during disso-
lution of the NaOH:
Because you’re given the solution’s heat capacity — not its molar heat capacity or its specific
heat capacity — you can simply substitute the released heat, q, into the equation
q = (heat capacity)(Tfinal – Tinitial)
Because the given heat capacity uses units of joules, you must convert the heat into joules from
kilojoules before plugging in the value:
2.81 × 104J = (4.18 × 103 J K–1)(Tfinal – 296K)
Solving for Tfinal yields 303K.

warm the liquid water to the boiling point, and heat to convert the liquid water to steam. Be
careful to match your units (J versus kJ):
q (warm ice to melting point) = (4.77 mol)(38.1J mol–1 K–1)(273K – 268K) = 909J
q (convert ice to liquid water) = (4.77 mol)(6.01 × 103J mol–1) = 2.87 × 104J
q (warm water to boiling point) = (4.77 mol)(75.3J mol–1 K–1)(373K – 273K) = 3.59 × 104J
q (convert liquid water to steam) = (4.77 mol)(4.068 × 104J mol–1) = 1.94 × 105J
The sum of all heats is 2.60 × 105J (or 2.60 × 102 kJ).

need to reverse Reactions 2 and 3 to put the right compounds on the reactant and product

divided by 2 so the stoichiometry of the final equation matches the stoichiometry of the target

f you’ve read any comic books, watched any superhero flicks, or even tuned in to one of
those fictional solve-the-crime-in-50-minutes shows on TV, you’ve likely come across a
reference to acids being dangerous substances. Acids are generally thought of as something
which evil villains intend to spray in the face of a hero or heroine, but somehow usually
manage to spill on themselves. However, you encounter and even ingest a wide variety of
fairly innocuous acids in everyday life. Citric acid, present in citrus fruits such as lemons
and oranges, is very ingestible, as is acetic acid, also known as vinegar.
Strong acids can indeed burn the skin and must be handled with care in the laboratory.
However, strong bases can burn skin as well. Chemists must have a more sophisticated
understanding of the differences between an acid and a base and their relative strengths
than simply their propensity to burn. This chapter focuses on how you can identify acids and
bases, as well as several ways to determine their strengths.
Three Complementary Methods 
for Defining Acids and Bases
As chemists came to understand acids and bases as more than just “stuff that burns,” their
understanding of how to define them evolved as well. It’s often said that acids taste sour,
while bases taste bitter, but we do not recommend that you go around tasting chemicals in
the laboratory to identify them as acids or bases. In the following sections, we explain three
much safer methods you can use to tell the difference between the two.
Method 1: Arrhenius sticks to the basics
Svante Arrhenius was a Swedish chemist who is credited not only with the acid-base determi-
nation method that is named after him, but with an even more fundamental chemical concept:
that of dissociation. Arrhenius proposed an explanation in his PhD thesis for a phenomenon
that, at the time, had chemists all over the world scratching their heads. What had them per-
plexed was this: Although neither pure salt nor pure water is a good conductor of electricity,
solutions in which salts are dissolved in water tend to be excellent conductors of electricity.

Arrhenius proposed that aqueous solutions of salts conducted electricity because the bonds
between atoms in the salts had been broken simply by mixing them into the water, forming
ions. Although the ion had been defined several decades earlier by Michael Faraday,
chemists generally believed at the time that ions could only form through electrolysis, or the
breaking of chemical bonds using electric currents, so Arrhenius’s theory was met with some
skepticism. Ironically, although his thesis committee wasn’t overly impressed and gave him a
grade just barely sufficient to pass, Arrhenius eventually managed to win over the scientific
community with his research. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1903 for the
same ideas that nearly cost him his doctorate.
Arrhenius subsequently expanded his theories to form one of the most widely used and
straightforward definitions of acids and bases. Arrhenius said that acids are substances that
form hydrogen (H+) ions when they dissociate in water, while bases are substances that form
hydroxide (OH–) ions when they dissociate in water.
Peruse Table 16-1 for a list of common acids and bases and note that all of the acids in the
list contain a hydrogen and most of the bases contain a hydroxide. The Arrhenius definition
of acids and bases is straightforward and works for many common acids and bases, but it’s
limited by its narrow definition of bases.

Method 2: Brønsted-Lowry tackles 
bases without a hydroxide ion
You no doubt noticed that some of the bases in Table 16-1 don’t contain a hydroxide ion,
which means that the Arrhenius definition of acids and bases can’t apply. When chemists
realized that several substances behaved like bases but didn’t contain a hydroxide ion, they
reluctantly acknowledged that another determination method was needed. Independently
proposed by Johannes Brønsted and Thomas Lowry in 1923 and therefore named after both
of them, the Brønsted-Lowry method for determining acids and bases accounts for those
pesky non-hydroxide–containing bases.
216
Part IV: Swapping Charges 

Under the Brønsted-Lowry definition, an acid is a substance that donates a hydrogen ion (H+)
in an acid-base reaction, while a base is a substance that accepts that hydrogen ion from the
acid. When ionized to form a hydrogen cation (an atom with a positive charge), hydrogen loses
its one and only electron and is left with only a single proton. For this reason, Brønsted-Lowry
acids are often called proton donors and Brønsted-Lowry bases are called proton acceptors.
The best way to spot Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases is to keep careful track of hydrogen
ions in a chemical equation. Consider, for example, the dissociation of the base sodium car-
bonate in water. Note that although sodium carbonate is a base, it doesn’t contain a hydrox-
ide ion.
Na2CO3 + 2H2O →H2CO3 + 2NaOH
This is a simple double replacement reaction (see Chapter 8 for an introduction to these
types of reactions). A hydrogen ion from water switches places with the sodium of sodium
carbonate to form the products carbonic acid and sodium hydroxide. By the Brønsted-Lowry
definition, water is the acid because it gave up its hydrogen to Na2CO3. This makes Na2CO3
the base because it accepted the hydrogen ion from H2O.
What about the substances on the right-hand side of the equation? Brønsted-Lowry theory
calls the products of an acid-base reaction the conjugate acid and conjugate base. The conju-
gate acid is produced when the base accepts a proton (in this case, H2CO3), while the conju-
gate base is formed when the acid loses its hydrogen (in this case, NaOH). This reaction 
also brings up a very important point about the strength of each of these acids and bases.
Although sodium carbonate is a very strong base, its conjugate acid, carbonic acid, is a very
weak acid. Similarly, water is an extremely weak acid, and its conjugate base, sodium hydrox-
ide, is a very strong base. Weak acids always form strong conjugate bases and vice versa.
The same is true of strong acids.
Method 3: Lewis relies on electron pairs
In the same year that Brønsted and Lowry proposed their definition of acids and bases, an
American chemist named Gilbert Lewis proposed an alternate definition that not only
encompassed Brønsted-Lowry theory, but also accounted for acid-base reactions in which a
hydrogen ion isn’t exchanged. Lewis’s definition relies on tracking lone pairs of electrons.
Under his theory, a base is any substance that donates a pair of electrons to form a coordi-
nate covalent bond with another substance, while an acid is a substance that accepts that
electron pair in such a reaction. As we explain in Chapter 5, a coordinate covalent bond is 
a covalent bond in which both of the bonding electrons are donated by one of the atoms
forming the bond.
All Brønsted-Lowry acids are Lewis acids, but in practice, the term Lewis acid is generally
reserved for Lewis acids that don’t also fit the Brønsted-Lowry definition. The best way to
spot a Lewis acid-base pair is to draw a Lewis dot structure of the reacting substances,
noting the presence of lone pairs of electrons. (We introduce Lewis structures in Chapter 5.)
For example, consider the reaction between ammonia (NH3) and boron trifluoride (BF3):
NH3 + BF3 →NH3BF3
217
Chapter 16: Giving Acids and Bases the Litmus Test

At first glance, neither the reactants nor the product appear to be acids or bases, but the
reactants are revealed as a Lewis acid-base pair when drawn as Lewis dot structures as in
Figure 16-1. Ammonia donates its lone pair of electrons to the bond with boron trifluoride,
making ammonia the Lewis base and boron trifluoride the Lewis acid.
Sometimes you can identify the Lewis acid and base in a compound without drawing the
Lewis dot structure. You can do this by identifying reactants that are electron rich (bases) or
electron poor (acids). Metal cations, for example, are electron poor and tend to act as a
Lewis acid in a reaction, accepting a pair of electrons.
In practice, it’s much simpler to use the Arrhenius or Brønsted-Lowry definitions of acid and
base, but you’ll need to use the Lewis definition when hydrogen ions aren’t being exchanged.
You can pick and choose among the definitions when you’re asked to identify the acid and
base in a reaction.

This is a classic Brønsted-Lowry acid-
base pair. Water loses a proton to ammo-
nia, forming a hydroxide anion (an atom
with a negative charge). This makes
water the proton donor, or Brønsted-
Lowry acid, and OH– its conjugate base.
Ammonia accepts the proton from water,

Measuring Acidity and Basicity: 
pH, pOH, and KW
A substance’s identity as an acid or a base is only one of many things that a chemist may
need to know about it. Sulfuric acid and water, for example, can both act as acids, but using
sulfuric acid to wash your face in the morning would be a grave error indeed. Sulfuric acid
and water differ greatly in acidity, a measurement of an acid’s strength. A similar quantity,
called basicity, measures a base’s strength.
Acidity and basicity are measured in terms of quantities called pH and pOH, respectively.
Both are simple scales ranging from 0 to 14, with low numbers on the pH scale representing a
higher acidity and therefore a stronger acid. On both scales, a measurement of 7 indicates a
neutral solution. On the pH scale, any number lower than 7 indicates that the solution is
acidic, with acidity increasing as pH decreases, while any number higher than 7 indicates a
basic solution, with basicity increasing as pH increases. In other words, the farther the pH
gets away from 7, the more acidic or basic a substance gets. pOH shows exactly the same
relationship between distance from 7 and acidity or basicity, only this time low numbers indi-
cate very basic solutions, while high numbers indicate very acidic solutions.

pH is calculated using the formula pH = –log[H+], where the brackets around H+ indicate that
it’s a measurement of the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter (or molarity; see
Chapter 12). pOH is calculated using a similar formula, with OH– concentration replacing the
H+ concentration: pOH = –log[OH–]. (The word log in each formula stands for logarithm.)
Because a substance with high acidity must have low basicity, a low pH indicates a high pOH
for a substance and vice versa. In fact, a very convenient relationship between pH and pOH
allows you to solve for one when you have the other: pH + pOH = 14.
You’ll often be given a pH or pOH and be asked to solve for the H+ or OH– concentrations
instead of the other way around. The logarithms in the pH and pOH equations make it tricky
to solve for [H+] or [OH–], but if you remember that a log is undone by raising 10 to both
sides of an equation, you quickly arrive at a convenient formula for [H+], namely [H+] = 10–pH.
Similarly, [OH–] can be calculated using the formula [OH–] = 10–pOH. As with pH and pOH, a
convenient relationship exists between [H+] and [OH–], which multiply together to equal 
a constant. This constant, called the ion product constant for water, or KW, is calculated as 
follows:
KW = [H+] × [OH–] = 1 × 10–14
220
Part IV: Swapping Charges 
Q.
Calculate the pH and pOH of a solution
with an [H+] of 1 × 10–8. Is the solution
acidic or basic? Do the same for a solu-
tion with an [OH–] of 2.3 × 10–11.
A.
For a solution with an [H+] of 1 × 10–8: 
pH = 8; pOH = 6; the solution is a base.
You have been given the H+ concentra-
tion, so first solve for the pH by plugging
[H+] into the formula for pH, giving
pH = –log[1 × 10–8] = 8
Plugging this value into the equation relat-
ing pH and pOH gives you a value for pOH.
14 – pH = 14 – 8 = 6 = pOH
A pH of 8 indicates that this solution is
very slightly basic. It’s not just a coinci-
dence that the exponent of the H+ con-
centration is equal to the pH. This is true
whenever the coefficient of the H+ con-
centration is 1.
For a solution with an [OH–] of 2.3 × 10–11:
pOH = 10.6; pH = 3.4; the solution is an
acid. The second portion of the problem
gives you an [OH–], in which case you
can either use the ion-product constant
for water to calculate the [H+] and then
solve for pH and pOH as you did before,
or, more simply, you can first calculate
the pOH and use it to find the pH.
Plugging an [OH–] of 2.3 × 10–11 into the
pOH equation yields
pOH = –log[2.3 × 10–11] = 10.6
Plug this value into the relation between
pH and pOH to get pH.
14 – pOH = 14 – 10.6 = 3.4 = pH
This low pH indicates that the substance
is a relatively strong acid.

Finding Strength through 
Dissociation: Ka and Kb
Arrhenius’s concept of dissociation (which we cover earlier in this chapter) gives us another
convenient way of measuring the strength of an acid or base. Although water tends to disso-
ciate all acids and bases, the degree to which they dissociate depends on their strength.
Strong acids such as HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4 dissociate completely in water, while weak acids
dissociate only partially. Practically speaking, a weak acid is any acid that doesn’t dissociate
completely in water.
To measure the amount of dissociation occurring when a weak acid is in aqueous solution,
chemists use a constant called the acid dissociation constant (Ka). Ka is a special variety of the
equilibrium constant introduced in Chapter 14. As we explain in Chapter 14, the equilibrium
constant of a chemical reaction is the concentration of products over the concentration of
reactants and indicates the balance between products and reactants in a reaction. The acid
dissociation constant is simply the equilibrium constant of a reaction in which an acid is
mixed with water and from which the water concentration has been removed. This is done
because the concentration of water is a constant in dilute solutions, and a better indicator of
acidity is the concentration of the dissociated products divided by the concentration of the
acid reactant. The general form of the acid dissociation constant is therefore
Where [HA] is the concentration of the acid before it loses its hydrogen, and [A] is the con-
centration of its conjugate base. Notice that the concentration of the hydronium ion (H3O+) is
used in place of the concentration of H+, which we use to describe acids earlier in this chap-
ter. In truth, they are one and the same. Generally speaking, H+ ions in aqueous solution will
be caught up by atoms of water in solution, making H3O+ ions.
A similar situation exists for bases. Strong bases such as KOH, NaOH, and Ca(OH)2 dissociate
completely in water. Weak bases don’t dissociate completely in water, and their strength is
measured by the base dissociation constant, or Kb.
Here, BOH is the base, and B is its conjugate acid. This can also be written in terms of the
acid and base:
In problems where you’re asked to calculate Ka or Kb, you’ll generally be given the concentra-
tion, or molarity, of the original acid or base and the concentration of its conjugate or hydro-
nium/hydroxide, but rarely both. Dissociation of a single molecule of acid involves the splitting
of that acid into one molecule of its conjugate base and one hydrogen ion, while dissociation

of a base always involves the splitting of that base into one molecule of the conjugate acid
and one hydroxide ion. For this reason, the concentration of the conjugate and the concen-
tration of the hydronium or hydroxide ion in any dissociation are equal, so you only need
one to know the other. You may also be given the pH and be asked to figure out the [H+]
(equivalent to [H3O+]) or [OH–]. Ka and Kb are also constants at constant temperature.

Answers to Questions on Acids and Bases
The following are the answers to the practice problems presented in this chapter.
a
In this reaction, HCl donates a proton to H2O, making it the Brønsted-Lowry acid. Water, which
accepts the proton, is the Brønsted-Lowry base. This makes H3O+ the conjugate acid and Cl– the
conjugate base. Water can act as the base in this reaction and as an acid in the example problem
because it’s composed of both a hydrogen ion and a hydroxide ion and can therefore either
accept or donate a proton.
b
For Arrhenius acids, remember to track the movement of H+ and OH– ions. If the reaction yields
an OH– product, the substance is a base, while an H+ product reveals the substance to be an
acid.
a. Arrhenius base. NaOH dissociates in water to form OH– ions, making it an Arrhenius base.
b. Arrhenius acid. HF dissociates in aqueous solution to form H+ ions, making it an Arrhenius
acid.
c
To identify Lewis acids and bases, track the movement of electron pairs. Draw a Lewis dot
structure to locate the atom with a lone pair available to donate. This is the Lewis base.
a. H2O is the Lewis base, while Cr3+ is the Lewis acid. Your Lewis dot structure should show
that the lone pair of electrons is donated to the bond by H2O.
b. NH3 is the Lewis base, while Ag+ is the Lewis acid. Your Lewis dot structure should show
that the lone pair of electrons is donated to the bond by NH3.
c. The negative charge on the chlorine indicates that it’s electron rich, making it the Lewis base.
HgCl2 is, therefore, the Lewis acid.

To calculate the pH values in this problem, use the equation pH = –log [H+] and plug in all
known values. If you’re given [OH–] instead of [H+], simply calculate the pOH (using the equa-
tion pOH = –log[OH–]) instead and then subtract that number from 14 to give you the pH.
a. pH = 13. Because the coefficient on the H+ concentration is 1, the pH is simply the exponent.
b. pH = 8.8. Plug the given [H+] into the pH equation, giving pH = –log (1.58 × 10–9) = 8.8
c. pH = 7.3. First, use the OH– concentration to calculate the pOH. pOH = –log(2 × 10–7) = 6.7.
Then use the relationship between pH and pOH (14 – pOH = pH) to determine the pH: 
14 – 6.7 = 7.3.
d. pH = 7. Because the coefficient of this OH– concentration is 1, you can read the pOH directly
from the exponent to get pOH = 7. Then use the relationship between pH and pOH 
(14 – pOH = pH) to determine the pH: 14 – 7 = 7.
e
To calculate pOH, simply take the negative logarithm of the OH– concentration. If you’re given
the H+ concentration, use it to calculate the pH and then subtract that value from 14 to yield 
the pOH.
a. pOH = 6.3. First, use the H+ concentration to calculate the pH. pH = –log(2 × 10–8) = 7.7. 
Then use the relationship between pH and pOH (14 – pH = pOH) to determine the pOH: 
14 – 7.7 = 6.3.
b. pOH = 10.3. Here, you can simply use the OH– concentration to calculate the pOH directly.
pOH = –log (5.1 × 10–11) = 10.3
f
To determine acidity, you need to calculate pH.
a. Basic. Use [OH–] to determine pOH. pOH = –log(2.5 × 10–7) = 6.6. Subtract this value from 14 to
get a pH of 7.4. This solution is very slightly greater than 7 and, therefore, slightly basic.
b. Acidic. Use [OH–] to determine pOH. pOH = –log(3.1 × 10–13) = 12.5. Subtract this value from 14
to get a pH of 1.5. This solution is significantly smaller than 7 and, therefore, quite acidic.
c. Acidic. Use the [H+] concentration to determine pH. pH = –log(4.21 × 10–5) = 4.4.
d. Basic. Use the [H+] concentration to determine pH. pH = –log(8.9 × 10–10) = 9.1.
g
In this problem, use the formula [H+] = 10–pH . If you’re given the pOH instead of the pH, begin by
subtracting the pOH from 14 to give you the pH and then plug that number into the formula.
a. 5.0 × 10–4. Use the pH to calculate the H+ equation using the equation [H+] = 10–pH. 
[H+] = 10–3.3 = 5.0 × 10–4
b. 2.04 × 10–8. Use the pH to calculate the H+ equation using the equation [H+] = 10–pH. 
[H+] = 10–7.69 = 2.04 × 10–8
c. 1.62 × 10–4. Begin by using the pOH to calculate the pH using the equation 14 – pOH = pH. 
14 – 10.21 = 3.79 = pH. Then use the pH to calculate the H+ equation using the equation 
[H+] = 10–pH. [H+] = 10–3.79 = 1.62 × 10–4
d. 1.82 × 10–13. Begin by using the pOH to calculate the pH using the equation 14 – pOH = pH. 
14 – 1.26 = 12.74 = pH. Then use the pH to calculate the H+ equation using the equation 
[H+] = 10–pH. [H+] = 10–12.74 = 1.82 × 10–13

h
6.3 × 10–5. The molarity in this problem tells you that the concentration of benzoic acid is 
5.0 × 10–1. You also know that the concentration of benzoic acid’s conjugate base is the same
as the given H+ concentration. All that remains is to write an equation for the acid dissociation
constant and plug in these concentrations.
i
1.6 × 10–4. You need to use the pH to calculate the [H+]. [H+] = 10–pH. [H+] = 10–1.93 = 1.1 × 10–2,
which must also be equal to the concentration of the conjugate base. All that remains is to
write an equation for the acid dissociation constant and plug in these concentrations.
j
pH = 8.6. Begin by considering the Kb equation: 
.
Because [OH–] = [NH4
+], you can rewrite this as 
. 
Solving this equation for [OH–] yields 
. 
Plugging in the known values of Kb and [NH3] into this equation yields
Use this to solve for the pOH. 
pOH = –log (3.6 × 10–6) = 5.4. 
The final step is to solve for pH by subtracting this number from 14. 
14 – 5.4 = 8.6

C
hapter 16 gives you the ins and outs of acids and bases, but treats each separately. In
the real world of chemistry, however, acids and bases often meet in solution, and when
they do, they’re drawn to one another. These unions of acid and base are called neutraliza-
tion reactions because the low pH of the acid and the high pH of the base essentially cancel
one another out, resulting in a neutral solution. In fact, when a hydroxide-containing base
reacts with an acid, the products are simply an innocuous salt and water.
Although strong acids and bases have their uses, the prolonged presence of a strong acid or
base in an environment not equipped to handle it can be very damaging. In the laboratory,
for example, you need to handle strong acids and bases carefully, and deliberately perform
neutralization reactions when appropriate. A lazy chemistry student will get a brow beating
from her hawk-eyed teacher if she attempts to dump a concentrated acid or base down the
laboratory sink. Doing so can damage the pipes and is generally unsafe. Instead, a responsi-
ble chemist will neutralize acidic laboratory waste with a base such as baking soda, and will
neutralize basic waste with an acid. Doing so makes a solution perfectly safe to dump down
the drain and often results in the creation of a satisfyingly sizzly solution while the reaction
is occurring.
In this chapter, we explore issues that arise when acids meet up with bases. First, not all
acids and bases are created equally — some compounds carry more acid or base equivalents
than others do. To account for these differences, we use normality, a measure of the effective
amounts of acid or base a compound produces in solution. Connected to the ideas of equiva-
lents and normality is titration, the process by which chemists add acids to bases (or vice
versa) a little bit at a time, gradually using up acid and base equivalents as the two neutralize
each other. We show you how to use titration to figure out the concentration of an unknown
acid. Then, we describe buffer solutions, mixtures that contain both acid and base forms of
the same compounds and serve to maintain the pH of the solution even when extra acid or
base is added. Finally, because salts are produced when acids react with bases, we discuss
the solubility product, Ksp, a number that tells you how soluble a salt is in solution.

At heart, neutralization reactions in which the base contains a hydroxide ion are simple
double replacement reactions of the form HA + BOH →BA + H2O (or in other words, an acid
reacts with a base to form a salt and water). You’re asked to write a number of such reactions
in this chapter, so be sure to review double replacement reactions and balancing equations
in Chapter 8 before you delve into the new and exciting world of neutralization.
Examining Equivalents and Normality
Unlike people, not all acids and bases are created equally. Some have an innate ability 
to neutralize more effectively than others. Consider hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sulfuric 
acid (H2SO4), for example. If you mixed 1M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) together with 1M
hydrochloric acid, you’d need to add equal amounts of each to create a neutral solution. If
you mixed sodium hydroxide with sulfuric acid, however, you’d need to add twice as much
sodium hydroxide as sulfuric acid. Why this blatant inequality of acids? The answer lies in
the balanced neutralization reactions for both acid/base pairs.
HCl + NaOH →NaCl + H2O
H2SO4 + 2NaOH →Na2SO4 + 2H2O
The coefficients in the balanced equations are the key to understanding this inequality. To
balance the equation, the coefficient 2 needs to be added to sodium hydroxide, indicating
that 2 moles of it must be present to neutralize 1 mole of sulfuric acid. On a molecular level,
this happens because sulfuric acid has two acidic hydrogen atoms to give up, and the single
hydroxide in a molecule of sodium hydroxide can only neutralize one of those two acidic
hydrogens to form water. Therefore, 2 moles of sodium hydroxide are needed for every 
1 mole of sulfuric acid. Hydrochloric acid, on the other hand, has only one acidic hydrogen
to contribute, so it can be neutralized by an equal amount of sodium hydroxide, which has
only one hydroxide to contribute to neutralization.
The number of moles of an acid or base multiplied by the number of hydrogens or hydrox-
ides that a molecule has to contribute in a neutralization reaction is called the number of
equivalents of that substance. Basically, the number of effective neutralizing moles available
determines the ratio of acid to base in a neutralization reaction.
You may also be asked to calculate the normality (N) of an acid or base, which is simply the
number of equivalents divided by the volume in liters.
The normality of an acidic or basic solution is often given in place of the molarity of that
solution. In many ways, the two are quite similar. Normality, however, unlike molarity, takes
equivalents into account. Mixing equal amounts of acidic and basic solutions of equal nor-
mality always results in a neutral solution, while the same can’t be said of solutions of equal
molarity. (Flip to Chapter 12 for an introduction to molarity.)

You may also find the equation NA × VA = NB × VB equating the volumes and normalities of a
neutral acid/base mixture useful. Normality multiplied by volume is, after all, just the number
of equivalents, and equal numbers of equivalents of acid and base must by definition neutral-
ize one another.

Q.
Your careless lab partner has just
dumped 24 mL of 0.8M magnesium
hydroxide, Mg(OH)2, into your lab sink.
Luckily, a plug in the bottom of the sink
is keeping it from entering the drain. You
must neutralize the base before you can
pull the plug. The only acid you have at
your disposal is 0.4M phosphoric acid
(H3PO4). How many milliliters should you
add to the sink before making your lab
partner reach her hand in to pull the
plug (assuming, of course, that you don’t
wish her any harm)?
A.
32 mL H3PO4. The first step to solving
this problem is to determine the number
of equivalents of Mg(OH)2 in the lab sink.
To do that, you first need the number of
moles of base. Because you’re given
molarity and volume, you simply multi-
ply the volume in liters by the molarity.

To find the number of equivalents in the

To neutralize this, you need an equal
number of equivalents of phosphoric
acid. You know you need 0.0384 equiva-
lents of H3PO4 and that there are 3 equiv-
alents per mole of H3PO4 (because there
are three hydrogen atoms), so you need
0.0128 mol of H3PO4 to neutralize the
base. Dividing this value by the molarity
of your solution (or, equivalently, multi-
plying by its reciprocal) gives you the
proper number of liters to add.

Concentrating on Titration 
to Figure Out Molarity
Imagine you’re a newly hired laboratory assistant who’s been asked to alphabetize the chem-
icals on the shelves of a chemistry laboratory during a lull in experimenting. As you reach for
the bottle of sulfuric acid, your first-day jitters get the better of you, and you knock over the
bottle. Some careless chemist failed to screw the cap on tightly! You quickly neutralize the
acid with a splash of baking soda and wipe up the now nicely neutral solution. As you pick
up the bottle, however, you notice that the spilled acid burned away most of the label! You
know it’s sulfuric acid, but there are several different concentrations of sulfuric acid on the
shelves, and you don’t know the molarity of the solution in this bottle. Knowing that your
boss will surely blame you if she sees the damaged bottle, and not wanting to get sacked on
your very first day, you quickly come up with a way to determine the molarity of the solution
and save your job.
You know that the bottle contains sulfuric acid of a mystery concentration, and you notice
bottles of 1M sodium hydroxide, a strong base, and phenolphthalein, a pH indicator, among
the chemicals on the shelves. You measure a small amount of the mystery acid into a beaker
and add a little phenolphthalein. You reason that if you drop small amounts of sodium
hydroxide into the solution until the phenolphthalein indicates that the solution is neutral by
turning the appropriate color, you’ll be able to figure out the acid’s concentration.
You can do this by making a simple calculation of the number of moles of sodium hydroxide
you have added, and then reasoning that the mystery acid must have an equal number of
equivalents to have been neutralized. This then leads to the number of moles of acid, and
that, in turn, can be divided by the volume of acid you added to the beaker to get the molar-
ity. Whew! You relabel the bottle and rejoice in the fact that you can come in and do menial
labor in the lab again tomorrow.
This process is called a titration, and it’s often used by chemists to determine the molarity of
acids and bases. In a titration calculation, you generally know the identity of an acid or base
of unknown concentration, and the identity and molarity of the acid or base which you’re
going to use to neutralize it. Given this information, you then follow six simple steps:

4.
How many milliliters of 1.5M phosphoric
acid, H3PO4, do you need to neutralize

1. Measure out a small volume of the mystery acid or base.
2. Add a pH indicator such as phenolphthalein.
Be sure to take note of the color that will indicate that the solution has reached 
neutrality.
3. Neutralize.
Slowly add the acid or base of known concentration into the solution until the indicator
shows that it’s neutral, keeping careful track of the volume added.
4. Calculate the number of moles added.
Multiply the number of liters of acid or base added by the molarity of that acid or base
to get the number of moles added.
5. Account for equivalents.
Determine how many moles of the mystery substance being neutralized are present
using equivalents. How many moles of your acid do you need to neutralize one mole of
base or vice versa?
6. Solve for molarity.
Divide the number of moles of the mystery acid or base by the number of liters meas-
ured out in Step 1, giving you the molarity.
The titration process is often visualized using a graph showing concentration of base on one
axis and concentration of acid on the other as in Figure 17-1. The interaction of the two
traces out a titration curve, which has a characteristic s shape.

Q.
If the laboratory assistant had to add
10 mL of 1M sodium hydroxide to neu-
tralize 5 mL of the sulfuric acid in his
impromptu titration, what did he end up
writing on the label for the concentration
of the sulfuric acid in the bottle?
A.
1M H2SO4. The problem tells us that the
volume from Step 1 of the titration process
is 5 mL and that the volume of base from
Step 3 is 10 mL. In Step 4, you must cal-
culate the number of moles of sodium
hydroxide added by multiplying the
volume in liters (0.01L) by the molarity
(1M) to give 0.01 mol NaOH. Because one
NaOH has only one hydroxide ion to con-
tribute to neutralization, there are also
0.01 equivalents of NaOH present. You
need an equal number of equivalents of
H2SO4 to complete the neutralization. But
H2SO4 has two equivalents to contribute
per mole, so you only need half as many
moles of the acid, or 0.005 mol. The final
step is to divide this value by the volume
of acid in liters added to get a molarity of
1. The assistant should have labeled the
bottle as 1M H2SO4.

Maintaining Your pH with Buffers
You may have noticed that the titration curve shown in Figure 17-1 has a flattened area in the
middle where pH doesn’t change significantly, even when you add a conspicuous amount of
base. This region is called a buffer region.
Certain solutions, called buffered solutions, resist changes in pH like a stubborn child resists
eating her Brussels sprouts: steadfastly at first, but choking them down reluctantly if enough
pressure is applied (such as the threat of no dessert). Although buffered solutions maintain
their pH very well when small amounts of acid or base are added to them or the solution is
diluted, they can only withstand the addition of a certain amount of acid or base before
becoming overwhelmed.
Buffers are most often made up of a weak acid and its conjugate base, though they can also
be made of a weak base and its conjugate acid. (Conjugate bases and acids are the products
in acid-base reactions; see Chapter 16 for details.) A weak acid in aqueous solution will be
partially dissociated, and the amount of dissociation depends on its pKa value (the negative
logarithm of its acid dissociation constant). The dissociation will be of the form HA + H2O →
H3O+ + A–, where A– is the conjugate base of the acid HA. The acidic proton is taken up by a
water molecule, forming hydronium. If HA were a strong acid, 100 percent of the acid would
become H3O+ and A–, but because it’s a weak acid, only a fraction of the HA dissociates, and
the rest remains HA.
The Ka (acid dissociation constant; see Chapter 16) of this reaction is defined by
Solving this equation for the [H3O+] concentration allows you to devise a relationship
between the [H3O+] and the Ka of a buffer.
Taking the negative logarithm of both sides of the equation and manipulating logarithm rules
yields an equation called the Henderson-Hasselbach equation that relates the pH and the pKa.
This equation can be manipulated using logarithm rules to get 
, which may
be more useful in certain situations.
The very best buffers and those best able to withstand the addition of both acid and base are
those for which [HA] and [A–] are approximately equal. When this occurs, the logarithmic
term in the Henderson-Hasselbach equation disappears, and the equation becomes pH = pKa.
When creating a buffered solution, chemists therefore choose an acid that has a pKa close to
the desired pH.

Chapter 17: Achieving Neutrality with Equivalents, Titration, and Buffers

If you add a strong base such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to this mixture of dissociated and
undissociated acid, its hydroxide is absorbed by the acidic proton, replacing the exception-
ally strong base OH– with a relatively weak base A– , and minimizing the change in pH.
HA + OH– →H2O + A–
This causes a slight excess of base in the reaction, but doesn’t affect pH significantly. You can
think of the undissociated acid as a reservoir of protons that are available to neutralize any
strong base that may be introduced to the solution. As we explain in Chapter 14, when a
product is added to a reaction, the equilibrium in the reaction changes to favor the reactants
or to “undo” the change in conditions. Because this reaction generates A–, the acid dissocia-
tion reaction happens less frequently as a result, further stabilizing the pH.
When a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), is added to the mixture, its acidic
proton is taken up by the base A–, forming HA.
H+ + A– →HA
This causes a slight excess of acid in the reaction but doesn’t affect pH significantly. It also
shifts the balance in the acid dissociation reaction in favor of the products, causing it to
happen more frequently and re-creating the base A–.
The addition of acid and base and their effect on the ratio of products and reactants is sum-
marized in Figure 17-2.
Buffers have their limits, however. The acid’s proton reservoir, for example, can only com-
pensate for the addition of a certain amount of base before it runs out of protons that can
neutralize free hydroxide. At this point, a buffer has done all it can do, and the titration curve
resumes its steep upward slope.

Measuring Salt Solubility: Ksp
In chemistry, a “salt” is not necessarily the substance you sprinkle on French fries, but has a
much broader definition. Rather, a salt is any substance that is a combination of an anion (an
atom with a negative charge) and a cation (an atom with a positive charge) and is created in a
neutralization reaction. Salts, therefore, tend to dissociate in water. The degree of dissociation
possible — in other words, the solubility of the salt — varies greatly from one salt to another.

the power of their coefficients, so 
Ksp = [Ca2+] × [F–]2.

Chemists use a quantity called the solubility product constant or Ksp to compare the solubilities
of salts. Ksp is calculated in much the same way as an equilibrium constant (Keq). The product
concentrations are multiplied together, each raised to the power of its coefficient in the bal-
anced dissociation equation. There is one key difference, however, between a Ksp and a Keq. Ksp
is a quantity specific to a saturated solution of salt, so the concentration of the undissociated
salt reactant has absolutely no bearing on its value. If the solution is saturated, then the
amount of possible dissociation is at its maximum, and any additional solute added merely
settles on the bottom.

Chapter 17: Achieving Neutrality with Equivalents, Titration, and Buffers
Answers to Questions on Neutralizing
Equivalents
The following are the answers to the practice problems presented in this chapter.
a
2HF + Ca(OH)2 →CaF2 + 2H2O. The balanced neutralization reaction tells you that there are
2 equivalents of CaOH2 per mole and 1 equivalent of HF per mole.
b
3 mol. Nitric acid (HNO3) is a monoprotic acid (an acid with a single hydrogen atom) with
1 equivalent per mole, while potassium hydroxide (KOH) also has 1 equivalent per mole. So you
need equal amounts of each to achieve neutralization.
c
3N H2SO4. Normality is equivalents per liter. Because volume is already built into molarity, you
simply need to multiply the molarity by the number of equivalents in 1 mol of H2SO4 (2 equiva-
lents, one for each hydrogen).
d
8.9 mL. The quickest way to arrive at the answer is to solve for the normality of the phosphoric
acid so you can use the equation NA × VA = NB × VB. Calculate this normality with the equation
Solve the equation NA × VA = NB × VB for VA and plug in all known values to get your answer.
e
9.6 mL Ca(OH)2. Begin by finding the number of moles of HCl by multiplying the molarity (2M)
by the volume (0.012L) to get 0.024 mol HCl. Next, calculate the number of moles of Ca(OH)2
needed to neutralize this amount using equivalents:
Divide this number by the molarity to get the volume of base added, giving 0.0096L Ca(OH)2.
f
0.16M Mg(OH)2. This problem gives you Step 6 in the titration procedure and asks you to back-
solve for the molarity of the base. Start by finding the number of moles of acid present in the
solution by multiplying the molarity (0.5M) by the volume (0.005L), giving you 0.0025 mol. Next,
determine the number of equivalents of magnesium hydroxide needed to neutralize 0.0025 mol
HNO2 by examining the balanced neutralization reaction.
2HNO2 + Mg(OH)2 →Mg(NO2)2 + 2H2O
Divide this by the volume of base (8 mL, or 0.008L) added to get a molarity of 0.16M Mg(OH)2.

Without an identity or a concentration, a chemist could still determine the number of equiva-
lents per liter of the mystery acid or base. If he titrates an extra-mysterious acid with a base of
known concentration until he achieves neutrality, then he knows the number of equivalents of
acid in the solution (equal to the number of equivalents of base added). This information may
even allow him to guess at its identity.
h
pH of 4.7. Ethanoic acid, also known as acetic acid or vinegar, would be an ideal buffer for
a pH close to its pKa value. You’re given the Ka of ethanoic acid in the example problem (it’s 
Ka = 1.8 × 10–5), so simply take the negative logarithm of that value to get your pKa value and
therefore your pH.
i
You’re given a pH and a pKa, which suggests that you need to use the Henderson-Hasselbach
equation. You’re given the total concentration of acid and conjugate base, but you don’t know
either of the concentrations in the equation individually, so begin by solving for their ratio.
This tells you that there are 1.6 mol of base for every 1 mol of acid. Expressing the amount of
base as a fraction of the total amount of acid and base therefore gives you
Multiply this number by the molarity of the solution (0.2M) to give you the molarity of the basic
solution, or 0.12M. The molarity of the acid is therefore 0.2M – 0.12M = 0.08M.
This means that to prepare the buffer you must take 0.2 mol of carbonic acid and add it to
somewhat less than 1,000 mL of water (say 800 mL). To this you must add enough of a strong
base such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to force the proper proportion of the carbonic acid
solution to dissociate into its conjugate base. Because you want to achieve a base concentra-
tion of 0.12M, you should add 120 mL of NaOH. Finally, you should add enough water to achieve
your final volume of 1,000 mL.

For silver (I) chromate: Ksp = [Ag+]2 × [CrO4
2–]; for strontium sulfate: Ksp = [Sr2+] × [SO2
2–].
To determine the solubility product constants of these solutions, you first need to write an
equation for their dissociation in water (see Chapter 8 for details).
Ag2CrO4 →2Ag+(aq) + CrO4
2–(aq)
SrSO2 →Sr2+(aq) + SO2

Raising the concentration of the products to the power of their coefficients in these balanced
reactions yields the Ksp for each.

I
n chemistry, electrons get all the action. Among other things, electrons can transfer
between reactants during a reaction. Reactions like these are called oxidation-reduction
reactions, or redox reactions for brevity. Redox reactions are as important as they are
common. But they’re not always obvious. In this chapter, you find out how to recognize
redox reactions and how to balance the equations that describe them.
Keeping Tabs on Electrons 
with Oxidation Numbers
If electrons move between reactants during redox reactions, then it should be easy to recog-
nize those reactions just by noticing changes in charge, right?
Sometimes.
The following two reactions are both redox reactions:
Mg(s) + 2H+(aq) →Mg2+(aq) + H2(g)
2H2(g) + O2(g) →2H2O(g)
In the first reaction, it’s obvious that electrons are transferred from magnesium to hydrogen.
(There are only two reactants, and magnesium is neutral as a reactant but positively charged
as a product.) In the second reaction, it’s not so obvious that electrons are transferred from
hydrogen to oxygen. We need a way to keep tabs on electrons as they transfer between reac-
tants. In short, we need oxidation numbers.
Oxidation numbers are tools to keep track of electrons. Sometimes an oxidation number
describes the actual charge on an atom. Other times an oxidation number describes an imag-
inary sort of charge — the charge an atom would have if all of its bonding partners left town,
taking their own electrons with them. In ionic compounds, oxidation numbers come closest

to describing actual atomic charge. The description is less apt in covalent compounds, in
which electrons are less clearly “owned” by one atom or another. (See Chapter 6 for the
basics on different types of compounds.) The point is this: Oxidation numbers are useful
tools, but they aren’t direct descriptions of physical reality.
Here are some basic rules for figuring out an atom’s oxidation number:
 Atoms in elemental form have an oxidation number of 0. So, the oxidation number of
both Mg(s) and O2(g) is 0.
 Single-atom (monatomic) ions have an oxidation number equal to their charge. So, the
oxidation number of Mg2+(aq) is +2 and the oxidation number of Cl–(aq) is –1.
 In a neutral compound, oxidation numbers add up to 0. In a charged compound, oxida-
tion numbers add up to the compound’s charge.
 In compounds, oxygen usually has an oxidation number of –2. An annoying exception is
the peroxides, like H2O2, in which oxygen has an oxidation number of –1.
 In compounds, hydrogen has an oxidation number of +1 when it bonds to nonmetals
(as in H2O), and an oxidation number of –1 when it bonds to metals (as in NaH).
 In compounds:
• Group IA atoms (alkali metals) have an oxidation number of +1.
• Group IIA atoms (alkaline earth metals) have an oxidation number of +2.
• In Group IIIA, Al and Ga atoms have an oxidation number of +3.
• Group VIIA atoms (halogens) usually have an oxidation number of –1.
You can deduce the oxidation numbers of other atoms in compounds (especially those of
transition metals) by taking into account these basic rules, as well as the compound’s overall
charge.
By applying these rules to chemical reactions, you can discern who supplies electrons to
whom.
 The chemical species that loses electrons is oxidized, and acts as the reducing agent (or
reductant).
 The species that gains electrons is reduced, and acts as the oxidizing agent (or oxidant).
All redox reactions have both an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent. Although a given
beaker can contain many different oxidizing agent–reducing agent pairs, each pair consti-
tutes its own redox reaction.
Oxidation may or may not involve bonding with oxygen, breaking bonds with hydrogen, or
losing electrons — but oxidation always means an increase in oxidation number. Reduction
may or may not involve bonding with hydrogen, breaking bonds with oxygen, or gaining 
electrons — but reduction always means a decrease in oxidation number.

Q.
Use oxidation numbers to identify the oxidizing and reducing agents in the following chemi-
cal reaction:
Cr2O3(s) + 2Al(s) →2Cr(s) + Al2O3(s)
A.
Cr2O3(s) is the oxidizing agent, and Al(s) is the reducing agent. The keys here are to recall
that atoms in elemental form (like solid Al and solid Cr) have oxidation numbers of 0, and
that oxygen typically has an oxidation number of –2 in compounds. The oxidation number
breakdown (shown in the following figure) reveals that Al(s) is oxidized to Al2O3(s), and
Cr2O3(s) is reduced to Cr(s). So, Al(s) is the reducing agent, and Cr2O3(s) is the oxidizing
agent. You can tell that Al(s) is oxidized because the oxidation number of Al is 0 in Al(s) but
is +2 in Al2O3(s). You can tell that Cr2O3(s) is reduced because the oxidation number of Cr is
+2 in Cr2O3(s) but is 0 in Cr(s).

Balancing Redox Reactions 
under Acidic Conditions
When you balance a chemical reaction equation, the primary concern is to obey the princi-
ple of Conservation of Mass — the total mass of the reactants must equal the total mass of
the products. (See Chapter 8 if you need to review this process.) In redox reactions, you
must obey a second principle as well: the Conservation of Charge. The total number of elec-
trons lost must equal the total number of electrons gained. In other words, you can’t just
leave electrons lying around. The universe is finicky about that type of thing.
Sometimes simply balancing a redox reaction with an eye to mass results in a charge-balanced
equation as well. Like a string of green lights when you’re driving, that’s a lovely thing when
it occurs, but you can’t count on it. So, it’s best to have a go-to system for balancing redox
reactions. The details of that system depend on whether the reaction occurs in acidic or
basic conditions — in the presence of excess H+ or excess OH–. Both variations use half-
reactions, incomplete parts of the total reaction that reflect either oxidation or reduction
alone. (We introduce the basics of acids and bases in Chapter 16.)
Here’s a summary of the method for balancing a redox reaction equation for a reaction 
under acidic conditions (see the next section for details on balancing a reaction under basic
conditions):
1. Separate the reaction equation into the oxidation half-reaction and the reduction
half-reaction. Use oxidation numbers to identify these component half-reactions.
2. Balance the half-reactions separately, temporarily ignoring O and H atoms.
3. Turn your attention to the O and H atoms. Balance the half-reactions separately,
using H2O to add O atoms and using H+ to add H atoms.
4. Balance the half-reactions separately for charge by adding electrons (e–).
5. Balance the charge of the half-reactions with respect to each other by multiplying
the reactions so that the total number of electrons is the same in each half-reaction.
6. Reunite the half-reactions into a complete redox reaction equation.
7. Simplify the equation by canceling items that appear on both sides of the arrow.

Balancing Redox Reactions 
under Basic Conditions
It’s true: Balancing redox equations can involve quite a lot of bookkeeping. Not much can be
done to remedy that unfortunate fact. But here’s the good news — the process for balancing
redox equations under basic conditions is 90 percent identical to the one used for balancing
under acidic conditions in the previous section. In other words, master one and you’ve mas-
tered both.
Here’s how easy it is to adapt your balancing method for basic conditions:
 Perform Steps 1–7 as described in the previous section for balancing under acidic 
conditions.
 Observe where H+ is present in the resulting equation. Add an identical amount of OH–
to both sides of the equation so that all the H+ is “neutralized,” becoming water.
 Cancel any amounts of H2O that appear on both sides of the equation.
That’s it. Really.

Answers to Questions on Electrons in Redox
Redox reactions have a bad reputation among chemistry students because of the per-
ceptions that they’re difficult to understand and even more difficult to balance. But the
perception is only a perception. The whole process boils down to the following princi-
ples:
 Balancing redox reaction equations is exactly like balancing other equations; you
simply have one more component to balance — the electron.
 Use oxidation numbers to discern the oxidation and reduction half-reactions.
 Under acidic conditions, balance O and H atoms by adding H2O and H+.
 Under basic conditions, balance as you do with acidic conditions, but then
neutralize any H+ by adding OH–.
So, relax. Well . . . relax after you check your work.

lthough we’re sure that you’re thrilled to hear that redox reactions are the driving
force behind the creation of rust and the greening of the copper domes on cathedrals,
you should know that you don’t need to sit around watching metal rust to see redox reac-
tions in action. In fact, they play a very important role in your everyday life. The redox reac-
tions that you find out about in Chapter 18 are the silent partner backing the unstoppable
Energizer Bunny. That’s right! Redox reactions are the essential chemistry behind the inner
workings of the all-important battery. In fact, an entire branch of chemistry, called electro-
chemistry, centers around the study of electrochemical cells, which create electrical energy
from chemical energy. We introduce the basics in this chapter.
Identifying Anodes and Cathodes
The energy provided by batteries is created in a unit called a voltaic or galvanic cell. Many
batteries use a number of voltaic cells wired in series, and others use a single cell. Voltaic
cells harness the energy released in a redox reaction and transform it into electrical energy. A
voltaic cell is created by connecting two metals called electrodes in solution with an external
circuit. In this way, the reactants aren’t in direct contact, but can transfer electrons to one
another through an external pathway, fueling the redox reaction.
The electrode that undergoes oxidation is called the anode. You can easily remember this if
you burn the phrase “an ox” (for anode oxidation) into your memory. The phrase “red cat” is
equally useful for remembering what happens at the other electrode, called the cathode,
where the reduction reaction occurs.
Electrons created in the oxidation reaction at the anode of a voltaic cell flow along an exter-
nal circuit to the cathode, where they fuel the reduction reaction taking place there. We use
the spontaneous reaction between zinc and copper as an example of a voltaic cell here, but

you should realize that many powerful redox reactions power many types of batteries, so
they’re not limited to reactions between copper and zinc.
Zinc metal reacts spontaneously with an aqueous solution of copper sulfate when they’re
placed in direct contact with one another. Zinc, being a more reactive metal than copper (it’s
higher on the activity series of metals presented in Chapter 8), displaces the copper ions in
solution. The displaced copper deposits itself as pure copper metal on the surface of the dis-
solving zinc strip. At first, it may appear to be a simple single replacement reaction, but it’s
also a redox reaction.
The oxidation of zinc proceeds as Zn(s) →Zn2+(aq) + 2e–. The two electrons created in this
oxidation of zinc are consumed by the copper in the reduction half of the reaction Cu2+(aq) +
2e– →Cu(s). This makes the total reaction Cu2+(aq) + 2e– + Zn(s) →Cu(s) + Zn2+(aq) + 2e–. The
electron duo appears on both sides of this combined reaction, revealing its identity as a
spectator, so the reaction is really just Cu2+(aq) + Zn(s) →Cu(s) + Zn2+(aq).
This reaction takes place when the two are in direct contact, but as we explain earlier in this
section, a voltaic cell is created by connecting the two reactants by an external pathway. Only
the electrons created at the anode in the oxidation reaction can travel to the reduction half of
the reaction along this external pathway. A voltaic cell using this same oxidation-reduction
reaction between copper and zinc is shown in Figure 19-1, which we examine piece by piece.
 First, note that zinc (Zn) is being oxidized at the anode, which is labeled with a nega-
tive sign. This doesn’t mean that the anode is negatively charged. Rather, it means that
electrons are being created there. The oxidation of zinc releases Zn2+ cations into the
solution as well as two electrons that flow along the circuit to the cathode. This oxida-
tion thus results in an increase of Zn2+ ions into the solution and a decrease in the mass
of the zinc metal anode.
 The electrons created by the oxidation of zinc at the anode fuel the reduction of
copper (Cu) at the cathode. This pulls Cu2+ from solution and deposits more Cu metal
on the cathode. The result is the exact opposite of the effect occurring at the anode:
The solution becomes less concentrated as Cu2+ ions are used up in the reduction reac-
tion, and the electrode gains mass as Cu metal is deposited.
 No doubt you noticed that Figure 19-1 also contains a U-shaped tube connecting the
two solutions. This is called the salt bridge, and it serves to correct the charge imbal-
ance created as the anode releases more and more cations into its solution, resulting in
a net positive charge, and the cathode uses up more and more of the cations in its solu-
tion, leaving it with a net negative charge. The salt bridge contains an electrolytic salt
(in this case NaNO3). A good salt bridge is created with an electrolyte whose compo-
nent ions won’t react with the ions already in solution. The salt bridge functions by
sucking up the extra NO3
– ions in the cathode solution and depositing NO3
– ions from
the other end of the bridge into the anode solution. It also sucks up the excess positive
charge at the anode by absorbing Zn2+ ions and depositing its own cation Na+ into the
cation solution. This is necessary because the solutions must be neutral for the redox
reaction to continue. It also completes the cell’s circuit by allowing for the flow of
charge back to the anode.
A useful way to remember how ions flow in the salt bridge is that anions travel to the
anode, while cations travel to the cathode.
250
Part IV: Swapping Charges 

These voltaic cells can’t run forever, however. The loss of mass at the zinc anode will eventu-
ally exhaust the supply of zinc, and the redox reaction won’t be able to continue. This phe-
nomenon is why most batteries run out over time. Rechargeable batteries take advantage of
a reverse reaction to resupply the anode, but many redox reactions don’t allow for this, so
rechargeable batteries must be made of very specific reactants.
The voltage provided by a battery depends largely on the materials that make up the two elec-
trodes. The reactions carried out in the 1.5V batteries that power your calculator, flashlight,
or MP3 player, for example, are often reactions between carbon and zinc-chloride or zinc and
manganese-dioxide. The high-voltage, long-lived batteries that power your computer, pace-
maker, or watch, on the other hand, generally have anodes composed of a lithium compound,
which can provide roughly twice the voltage of many other batteries and are longer-lived (cer-
tainly a desirable quality in the battery that powers a pacemaker). Although many batteries
contain a single voltaic cell, a number of battery types that require high voltages, such as car
batteries, harness the power of multiple voltaic cells by wiring them in series with one
another. A 12V car battery, for example, is created by wiring six 2V voltaic cells together.
Voltage is measured by attaching a voltmeter to a circuit as shown in Figure 19-1. When the
switch is closed, the voltmeter reads the potential difference between the anode and cathode
of the cell.

Chapter 19: Galvanizing Yourself into Electrochemistry

Calculating Electromotive Force and 
Standard Reduction Potentials
In the previous section, we take for granted that charge can flow through the external circuit
connecting the two halves of a voltaic cell, but what actually causes this flow of charge? The
answer lies in a concept called potential energy. When a difference in potential energy is
established between two locations, an object has a natural tendency to move from an area of
higher potential energy to an area of lower potential energy.
When Wile E. Coyote places a large circular boulder at the top of a hill overlooking a road on
which he knows his nemesis the Road Runner will soon be traveling, he takes it for granted

Q.
A voltaic cell harnesses the reaction
2Al(s) + 3Sn2+(aq) →2Al3+(aq) + 3Sn(s).
Which metal makes up the anode and
which makes up the cathode?
A.
The aluminum makes up the anode, and
the tin makes up the cathode. The best
place to start is to add in the spectator
electrons to both sides of the equation
to balance the positive charges of the
cations. This gives you the equation
2Al(s) + 3Sn2+(aq) + 6e– →2Al3+(aq) + 6e– +
3Sn(s). Next, isolate the oxidation and
reduction half-reactions (as we explain in
Chapter 18):
Oxidation half-reaction: 
2Al(s) →2Al3+(aq) + 6e–
Reduction half-reaction: 
3Sn2+(aq) + 6e– →3Sn(s)
Using your “an ox” and “red cat”
mnemonics, you know that the anode is
the site of aluminum (Al) oxidation, while
the cathode is the site of tin (Sn) reduc-
tion. As with the earlier zinc/copper
example, this is also apparent using the
activity series of metals (see Chapter 8),
which shows that aluminum is far more
reactive than tin.

that when he releases the boulder it will simply roll down the hill. This is due to the differ-
ence in potential energy between the top and bottom of the hill, which have high and low
potential energies respectively (although Coyote will need to be far more well versed in
physics if he’s to time the crushing of his adversary properly).
In a similar, though less diabolical, manner, the electrons produced at the anode of a voltaic
cell have a natural tendency to flow along the circuit to a location with lower potential: the
cathode. This potential difference between the two electrodes causes the electromotive force,
or EMF, of the cell. EMF is also often referred to as the cell potential and is denoted Ecell. The
cell potential varies with temperature and concentration of products and reactants and is
measured in volts (V). The Ecell that occurs when concentrations of solutions are all at 1M and
cell is at standard temperature and pressure (STP) is given the special name of standard cell
potential, or E0
cell.
Much like assigning enthalpies to pieces of a reaction and summing them using Hess’s Law
(see Chapter 15), cell potentials can be tabulated by taking the difference between the stan-
dard potentials of the oxidation and reduction half-reactions separately. To do this properly,
chemists had to choose either the oxidation or reduction half-reactions to be positive and the
other to be negative. They happened to assign positive potentials to reduction half-reactions
and negative potentials to oxidation half-reactions. The standard potential at an electrode is
therefore a measurement of its propensity to undergo a reduction reaction. As such, these
potentials are often referred to as standard reduction potentials. They are calculated using 
the formula
E0
cell = E0
red(cathode) – E0
red(anode)
Table 19-1 lists some standard reduction potentials along with the reduction half-reactions
associated with them. The table is ordered from the most negative E0
cell (most likely to oxi-
dize) to the most positive E0
cell (most likely to be reduced). The reactions with negative E0
cell
are therefore reactions that happen at the anode of a voltaic cell, while those with a positive
E0
cell occur at the cathode.

Note that not all the reactions in Table 19-1 show the oxidation or reduction of solid metals
as in our examples so far. Liquids and gases are thrown in as well. Not every voltaic cell is
fueled by a reaction taking place between the metals of the electrodes. Although the cathode
itself must be made of a metal to allow for the flow of electrons, those electrons can be
passed into a gas or a liquid to complete the reduction half-reaction. Examine Figure 19-2 for
an example of such a cell, which includes a gaseous electrode.
An equation relates standard cell potential to the EMF of the cell. This equation, called the
Nernst equation, is expressed as
Ecell = E0
cell – (RT / nF) ln Q
Where Q is the reaction quotient (discussed in Chapter 14), n is the number of electrons
transferred in the redox reaction, R is the universal gas constant (8.21J/(K × mol)), T is the

Q.
What is the EMF of the cell shown in Figure 19-1 when it is at a temperature of 25°C if Cu2+ is
0.1M and Zn2+ is 3.0M?
A.
1.06V. To find the EMF, or Ecell, you first need to determine the standard cell potential. Do
this by looking up the oxidation and reduction half-reactions in Table 19-1. The oxidation of
zinc has an E0
cell of –0.76, while the reduction of copper has an E0
cell of 0.34. Recognizing that
copper is the cathode and zinc the anode, you can plug these values into the equation 
E0
cell = E0
red(cathode) – E0
red(anode) to get E0
cell = 0.34V + 0.76V = 1.10V.
You must then use the Nernst equation to calculate the EMF, which means you must determine
the values of Q and n. You can find n by examining the oxidation and reduction half-reactions
presented earlier in this chapter, which indicate that two electrons are exchanged in the 
process. Q is expressed as 
(if you can’t recall how to calculate 
reaction quotients, see Chapter 14). Next, write out the Nernst equation for this specific cell.

temperature in Kelvin, and F is the Faraday constant (9.65 × 104 coulombs/mol, where
coulombs are a unit of electric charge). Recall also that ln stands for “natural log” and is a
function in your calculator. With this information, you can assign quantitative values to the
EMFs of batteries. The equation also reveals that the EMF of a battery depends on tempera-
ture, which is why batteries are less likely to function well in the cold.

Coupling Current to Chemistry: 
Electrolytic Cells
A positive standard cell potential tells you that the cathode is at a higher potential than the
anode, and the reaction is therefore spontaneous. What do you do with a cell that has a nega-
tive E0
cell? Electrochemical cells that rely on such nonspontaneous reactions are called elec-
trolytic cells. The redox reactions in electrolytic cells rely on a process called electrolysis.
These reactions require that a current be passed through the solution, forcing it to split into
components that then fuel the redox reaction. Such cells are created by applying a current
source, such as a battery, to electrodes placed in a solution of molten salt, or salt which has
been heated until it melts. This splits the ions that make up the salt.
Cations have a natural tendency to migrate toward the negative anode, where they’re oxi-
dized, and anions migrate toward the positive cathode and are reduced. Thus the “an ox”
and “red cat” mnemonics are still valid.
Figure 19-3 shows an electrolytic cell using molten sodium chloride. A redox reaction
between sodium and chlorine won’t happen spontaneously, but the electrical energy pro-
duced by the battery provides the additional energy needed to fuel the reaction. In the
process, chlorine anions are oxidized at the anode, creating chlorine gas, and sodium is
reduced at the cathode and is deposited onto it as sodium metal.
The amount of pure metal created in an electrolytic cell can be analyzed quantitatively. First,
you need to calculate the number of electrons that must be created to fuel electrolysis. To do

this, write out the reduction half-reaction and determine how many electrons are needed to
accomplish it. In the cell shown in Figure 19-3, reduction of sodium at the cathode occurs
according to the equation Na+(aq) + e– →Na(s), thus 1 mole of electrons can reduce aqueous
sodium to produce 1 mole of sodium metal. If the cathode were reducing copper metal
according to the reaction Cu2+(aq) + 2e– →Cu(s), it would require 2 moles of electrons for
every mole of copper created, and so on.
To determine how many moles of metal have been deposited, you need to determine how
many electrons have flowed through the circuit to fuel this reaction. You can determine the
amount of charge passing through the circuit (measured in Coulombs, the standard unit of
charge) by using the current provided by the power source and the amount of time the cell
operates. This is done using the relationship
Charge = Current in amperes × Time in seconds
This works out because the ampere (the standard unit of current; abbreviated A) is defined
as 1 coulomb per second. Because this gives us the amount of charge that has passed
through the circuit during its operating time, all that remains is to calculate the number of
moles of electrons that make up that amount of charge. For this, you use the conversion
factor 1 mol e– = 96,500 coulombs.

cell shown in Figure 19-3 if it was connected to a battery providing a 15A current for 1.5 hours?

must multiply the current by the time in seconds, which requires the conversion

Answers to Questions on Electrochemistry
Are you charged up to check your answers? Take a gander at this section to see how
you did on the practice problems in this chapter.
a
You actually need to evaluate the second portion of this question first, which can be answered
with a simple glance at the activity series of metals in Chapter 8, which tells you that cadmium
is more active than tin. So it must be cadmium that is oxidized and makes up the anode, and tin
that is reduced and makes up the cathode. The half-reactions are therefore
Oxidation half-reaction: Cd(s) →Cd2+(aq) + 2e–
Reduction half-reaction: Sn2+(aq) + 2e– →Sn(s)
b
Chromium is more active than silver (as we explain in Chapter 8), so chromium is oxidized in
this reaction and silver reduced according to the half-reactions
Oxidation half-reaction: Cr(s) →Cr3+(aq) + 3e–
Reduction half-reaction: Ag2+(aq) + 2e– →Ag(s)
The balanced redox reaction is therefore 2Cr(s) + 3Ag2+(aq) + 6e– →2Cr3+(aq) + 6e– + 3Ag(s); see
Chapter 18 for details on balancing redox reactions.

1.89g Al(s). First, you have to write out the reduction half of the reaction to determine how
many moles of electrons you need to reduce the aluminum.
Reduction half-reaction: Al3+(aq) + 3e– →Al(g)
This means that 3 moles of electrons are required to reduce each mole of aluminum. Next
convert 45 minutes into seconds, which gives you 2,700 sec. Multiply this by the current of
8 amperes to get 21,600 coulombs. Divide this by 96,500 to give you 0.22 mol of electrons pro-
duced. Divide this number by 3 to give you 0.07 mol aluminum. Lastly, multiply the number of
moles of aluminum by its gram atomic mass (which is 27 grams) to give you 1.89g Al(s).

A
s described in Chapter 3, many elements in the periodic table exist in unstable ver-
sions called radioisotopes. These radioisotopes decay into other (usually more stable)
elements in a process called radioactive decay. Because the stability of these radioisotopes
depends on the composition of their nuclei, radioactivity is considered a form of nuclear
chemistry. Unsurprisingly, nuclear chemistry deals with nuclei and nuclear processes.
Nuclear fusion, which fuels our sun, and nuclear fission, which fuels a nuclear bomb, are
examples of nuclear chemistry because they deal with the joining or splitting of atomic
nuclei. In this chapter, you find out about nuclear decay, rates of decay called half-lives,
and the processes of fusion and fission.
Decaying Nuclei in Different Ways
Many radioisotopes exist, but not all radioisotopes are created equal. Radioisotopes break
down through three separate decay processes (or decay modes): alpha decay, beta decay,
and gamma decay.
Alpha decay
The first type of decay process, called alpha decay, involves emission of an alpha particle
by the nucleus of an unstable atom. An alpha particle (α particle) is nothing more exotic than
the nucleus of a helium atom, made of two protons and two neutrons. Emitting an alpha par-
ticle decreases the atomic number of the daughter nucleus by 2 and decreases the mass
number by 4. (See Chapter 3 for details about atomic numbers and mass numbers.) In gen-
eral, then, a parent nucleus X decays into a daughter nucleus Y and an alpha particle.

Beta decay
The second type of decay, called beta decay (β decay), comes in three forms, termed beta-
plus, beta-minus, and electron capture. All three involve emission or capture of an electron or
a positron (a particle with the tiny mass of an electron but with a positive charge), and all
three also change the atomic number of the daughter atom.
 In beta-plus decay, a proton in the nucleus decays into a neutron, a positron (e+),
and a tiny, weakly interacting particle called a neutrino (ν). This decay decreases
the atomic number by 1. The mass number, however, does not change. Both protons
and neutrons are nucleons (particles in the nucleus), after all, each contributing
1 atomic mass unit. The general pattern of beta-plus decay is shown here:
 Beta-minus decay essentially mirrors beta-plus decay: A neutron converts into a
proton, emitting an electron and an antineutrino (which has the same symbol as a
neutrino except for the line on top). Particle and antiparticle pairs such as neutrinos
and antineutrinos are a complicated physics topic, so we’ll keep it basic here by saying
that a neutrino and an antineutrino would annihilate one another if they ever touched,
but are otherwise very similar. Again, the mass number remains the same after decay
because the number of nucleons remains the same. However, the atomic number
increases by 1 because the number of protons increases by 1:
 The final form of beta decay, electron capture, occurs when an inner electron (one
in an orbital closest to the atomic nucleus; see Chapter 4 for more about orbitals) is
“captured” by an atomic proton. By capturing the electron, the proton converts into a
neutron and emits a neutrino. Here again, the atomic number decreases by 1:
Gamma decay
The final form of decay, termed gamma decay (γ decay), involves emission of a gamma ray (a
high-energy form of light) by an excited nucleus. Although gamma decay changes neither the
atomic number nor the mass number of the daughter nucleus, it often accompanies alpha or
beta decay. Gamma decay allows the nucleus of a daughter atom to reach its lowest possible
energy (most favorable) state. The general form of gamma decay is shown here, where 
represents the excited state of the parent nucleus, and the Greek letter gamma (γ) rep-
resents the gamma ray.

Q.
If a parent nucleus has decayed into 
through alpha decay, what was the
parent nucleus and what other particles
were produced?
A.
The parent nucleus was radium, and an
alpha particle was produced. Alpha
decay lowers the mass number by 4 and
the atomic number by 2, so the parent

nucleus must have had a mass number of
222 and an atomic number of 88.
Consulting your periodic table (check
out an example in Chapter 4), you find
that an atom with an atomic number of
88 is radium, so the parent nucleus must 
have been

Measuring Rates of Decay: Half-Lives
The word “radioactive” sounds scary, but science and medicine are stuffed with useful,
friendly applications for radioisotopes. Many of these applications are centered on the pre-
dictable decay rates of various radioisotopes. These predictable rates are characterized by
half-lives. The half-life of a radioisotope is simply the amount of time it takes for exactly half
of a sample of that isotope to decay into daughter nuclei. For example, if a scientist knows
that a sample originally contained 42 mg of a certain radioisotope and measures 21 mg of
that isotope in the sample four days later, then the half-life of that radioisotope is four days.
The half-lives of radioisotopes range from seconds to billions of years.
Radioactive dating is the process scientists use to date samples based on the amount of
radioisotope remaining. The most famous form of radioactive dating is carbon-14 dating,
which has been used to date human remains and other organic artifacts. However, radioiso-
topes have also been used to date the earth, the solar system, and even the universe. (Flip
back to Chapter 3 to find out more about carbon-14 dating.)
Listed in Table 20-1 are some of the more useful radioisotopes, along with their half-lives and
decay modes (we discuss these modes earlier in this chapter).

Chapter 20: Doing Chemistry with Atomic Nuclei
Making and Breaking Nuclei: 
Fusion and Fission
Fission and fusion differ from radioactive decay in that they require the nucleus of a parent
atom to interact with an outside particle. Because the forces which hold together atomic
nuclei are ridiculously powerful, the energy involved in splitting or joining two nuclei is
tremendous. Here are the differences between fusion and fission:
 In nature, nuclear reactions occur only in the very center of stars like our sun, where
extreme temperatures cause atoms of hydrogen, helium, and other light elements to
smash together and join into one. This extremely energetic process, called nuclear
fusion, is ultimately what causes the sun to shine. Fusion also provides the outward
pressure required to support the sun against gravitational collapse, an event that is
even more dramatic than it sounds.
Q.
If a sample originally contained 1g of
thorium-234, how much of that isotope
will the sample contain one year later?
A.
2.76x10–5g. Table 20-1 tells us that
thorium-234 has a half-life of 24.1 days,
so that’s T. The time elapsed (t) is 365
days, and the original sample was 1g
(A0). Plugging these values into the half-
life equation gives:
Notice that the units in the exponent
cancel out, so you’re left with units of
grams in the end. These units make
sense because you’re measuring the
mass of sample remaining.

 Nuclear fission, the splitting of an atomic nucleus, doesn’t occur in nature. Humans first
harnessed the tremendous power of fission during the Manhattan Project, an intense,
hush-hush effort by the United States that led to the development of the first atomic
bomb in 1945. Fission has since been used for more benign purposes in nuclear power
plants. Nuclear power plants use a highly regulated process of fission to produce energy
much more efficiently than is done in traditional, fossil fuel–burning power plants.
Fission and fusion reactions can be distinguished from one another with a simple glance at
products and reactants. If the reaction shows one large nucleus splitting into two smaller
nuclei, then it’s most certainly fission, whereas a reaction showing two small nuclei combin-
ing to make a single heavier nucleus is definitely fusion.
Q.
What type of nuclear reaction would
you expect plutonium-239 to undergo
and why?
A.
Fission is the expected reaction.
Plutonium has an exceptionally large
number of nucleons and is therefore
likely to undergo fission. Fusion is impos-
sible in all elements heavier than iron,
and plutonium is much much heavier
than iron.

Answers to Questions on Nuclear Chemistry
The following are the answers to the practice problems presented in this chapter.
a
Alpha decay results in the emission of a helium nucleus from the parent atom, which leaves the
daughter atom with two fewer protons and a total of four fewer nucleons. In other words, the
atomic number of the daughter atom is 2 fewer than the parent atom, and the mass number is 4
fewer. Because the proton number defines the identity of an atom, the element with two fewer
protons than uranium must be thorium.
b
Electron capture is a form of beta decay that results in the atomic number decreasing by 1 and
the mass number remaining the same.

5,726 years; carbon-14. The problem tells us that A0 = 50g, A = 44.3g, and t = 1,000. Use the same
process as in Question 4 to isolate the exponent, this time solving for T instead of t. Doing so
gives us 5,726 years, which closely matches the half-life of carbon-14 in Table 20-1. (Try to keep
the numbers in your calculator throughout each step of the process, and don’t round until the
end of the problem.)

arbon is the darling of many chemists — organic
chemists in particular. The reasons for infatuation
with carbon are many. Compounds based on carbon are
abundant, diverse, and capable of an amazing array of
chemical tricks. Organic chemists like to build structures
with carbon building blocks, and then decorate those
structures with a variety of other chemical characters.
Biology has also found carbon compounds useful, because
all life (on Earth, anyway) depends on organic chemistry.
In this part, we describe some of the methods and splen-
dors of the chemistry of carbon-based compounds.

Making Chains with Carbon
In This Chapter
 Fueling your knowledge of hydrocarbons
 Naming alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes
 Saturating and unsaturating hydrocarbons
A
ny study of organic chemistry begins with the study of hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons
are some of the simplest and most important organic compounds. Organic compounds
are based on carbon skeletons. Hydrocarbon skeletons can be modified — you can dress
them up with chemically interesting atoms like oxygen, nitrogen, halogens, phosphorus, sili-
con, or sulfur. This cast of atomic characters may seem like a rather small subset of the
more than 100 elements in the periodic table. It’s true: Organic compounds typically use
only a very small number of the naturally occurring elements. Yet these molecules include
the most biologically important compounds in existence. As an introductory chemistry stu-
dent, you won’t be expected to know more than the basic structure of organic molecules
and how to name them. So relax and get organic.
Single File Now: Linking Carbons 
into Continuous Alkanes
The simplest of the hydrocarbons fall into the category of alkanes. Alkanes are chains of
carbon molecules connected by single covalent bonds. Chapter 5 describes how single cova-
lent bonds result when atoms share pairs of valence electrons. Carbon molecules have four
valence electrons. So, carbon atoms are eager to donate their four valence electrons to cova-
lent bonds so they can receive four donated electrons in turn, filling their valence shell. In
other words, carbon really likes to form four bonds. In alkanes, each of these is a single bond
with a different partner.
As the name hydrocarbon suggests, these partners may be hydrogen or carbon. The simplest
of the alkanes, called continuous- or straight-chain alkanes, consist of one straight chain of
carbon atoms linked with single bonds. Hydrogen atoms fill all the remaining bonds. Other
types of alkanes include closed circles and branched chains, but we begin with straight-chain
alkanes because they make clear the basic strategy for naming hydrocarbons. From the
standpoint of naming, the hydrogen atoms in a hydrocarbon are more or less “filler atoms.”
Alkanes’ names are based on the largest number of consecutively bonded carbon atoms. So,
the name of a hydrocarbon tells you about that molecule’s structure.

To name a straight-chain alkane, simply match the appropriate chemical prefix with the 
suffix –ane. The prefixes relate to the number of carbons in the continuous chain and are
listed in Table 21-1.

The naming method in Table 21-1 tells you how many carbons are in the chain. Because you
know that each carbon has four bonds and because you are fiendishly clever, you can
deduce the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule as well. Consider the carbon struc-
ture of pentane, for example, shown in Figure 21-1.
Only four carbon-carbon bonds are required to produce the five-carbon chain of pentane.
This leaves many bonds open — two for each interior carbon and three for each of the termi-
nal carbons. These open bonds are satisfied by carbon-hydrogen bonds, thereby forming a
hydrocarbon, as shown in Figure 21-2.

Part V: Going Organic 

If you add up the hydrogen atoms in Figure 21-2, you get 12. So, pentane contains 5 carbon
atoms and 12 hydrogen atoms.
As the organic molecules you study get more and more complicated, it will become more and
more important to draw the molecular structure to visualize the molecule. In the case of
straight-chain alkanes, the simplest of all organic molecules, you can remember a convenient
formula for calculating the number of hydrogen atoms in the alkane without actually drawing
the chain:
Number of hydrogen atoms = (2 × number of carbon atoms) + 2
You can refer to the same molecule in a number of different ways. For example, you can refer
to pentane by its name (ahem . . . pentane), by its molecular formula, C5H12, orby the com-
plete structure in Figure 21-2. Clearly, these different names include different levels of struc-
tural detail. A condensed structural formula is another naming method, one that straddles the
divide between a molecular formula and a complete structure. For pentane, the condensed
structural formula is CH3CH2CH2CH2CH3. This kind of formula assumes that you understand
how straight-chain alkanes are put together. Here’s the lowdown:
 Carbons on the end of a chain, for example, are only bonded to one other carbon, so
they have three additional bonds that are filled by hydrogen and are labeled as CH3 in a
condensed formula.
 Interior carbons are bonded to two neighboring carbons and have only two hydrogen
bonds, so they’re labeled CH2.
Your chemistry teacher will require you to draw structures of alkanes, given their names, 
and will require you to name alkanes, given their structure. If your teacher fails to make such
requests, ask to see his credentials. You may be dealing with an impostor.

What is the name of the following struc-

are four. Table 21-1 helpfully points out
that four-carbon chains earn the prefix
but–. What’s more, this molecule is an
alkane (because it contains only single
bonds), so it receives the suffix –ane.
So, what you’ve got is butane. With four
carbon atoms in a straight chain, ten
hydrogen atoms are required to satisfy
all the carbon bonds, so the molecular
formula of butane is C4H10.

Going Out on a Limb: Making Branched
Alkanes by Substitution
Not all alkanes are straight-chain alkanes. That would be too easy. Many alkanes are so-called
branched alkanes. Branched alkanes differ from continuous-chain alkanes in that carbon
chains substitute for a few hydrogen atoms along the chain. Atoms or other groups (like
carbon chains) that substitute for hydrogen in an alkane are called substituents.
Naming branched alkanes is slightly more complicated, but you need only to follow a simple
set of steps to arrive at a proper (and often lengthy) name.
1. Count the longest continuous chain of carbons.
Tricky chemistry teachers often draw branched alkanes with the longest chain snaking
through a few branches instead of obviously lined up in a row. Consider the two carbon
structures shown in Figure 21-3. The two are actually the same structure, drawn differ-
ently! Yikes. In either case, the longest continuous chain in this structure has eight 
carbons.

2. Number the carbons in the chain starting with the end that’s closest to a branch.
You can always check to be sure you’ve done this step correctly by numbering the
carbon chain from the opposite end as well. The correct numbering sequence is the
one in which the substituent branches extend from the lowest-numbered carbons. For
example, as it’s drawn and numbered in Figure 21-3, the alkane has substituent groups
branching off of its third, fourth, and fifth carbons. If the carbon chain had been num-
bered backwards, these would be the fourth, fifth, and sixth carbons in the chain.
Because the first set of numbers is lower, the chain is numbered properly. The longest
chain in a branched alkane is called the parent chain.
3. Count the number of carbons in each branch.
These groups are called alkyl groups and are named by adding the suffix –yl to the
appropriate alkane prefix (Table 21-1 awaits your visit). The three most common alkyl
groups are the methyl (one carbon), ethyl (two carbons), and propyl (three carbons)
groups. Figure 21-3 has two methyl groups, one ethyl group, and no propyl groups.
Be careful when you find yourself dealing with alkyl groups made up of more than just
a few carbons. A tricky drawing may cause you to misnumber the parent chain!

4. Attach the number of the carbon from which each substituent branches to the front
of the alkyl group name.
For example, if a group of two carbons is attached to the third carbon in a chain, like it
is in Figure 21-3, the group is called 3-ethyl.
5. Check for repeated alkyl groups.
If multiple groups with the same number of carbons branch off the parent chain, don’t
repeat the name. Rather, include multiple numbers, separated by commas, before the
alkyl group name. Also, specify the number of instances of the alkyl group by using the
prefixes di–, tri–, tetra–, and so on. For example, if one-carbon groups (in other words,
methyl groups) branch off carbons four and five of the parent chain, the two methyl
groups appear together as “4,5-dimethyl.”
6. Place the names of the substituent groups in front of the name of the parent chain in
alphabetical order.
Prefixes like di–, tri–, and tetra– don’t figure into the alphabetizing. So, the proper name
of the organic molecule in Figure 21-3 is 3-ethyl-4,5-dimethyloctane.
Note that hyphens are used to connect all the naming elements except for the last con-
nection to the parent chain (. . . dimethyl-octane is wrong).

Getting Unsaturated: Alkenes and Alkynes
Carbons can do more than enagage in four single bonds. There’s more to organic molecules
than substituent-for-hydrogen swaps. When carbons in an organic compound fill their
valence shells entirely with single bonds, we say the compound is saturated. But many hydro-
carbons contain carbons that bond to each other more than once, creating double or triple
covalent bonds. We say these hydrocarbons are unsaturated because they have fewer than
the maximum possible number of hydrogens or substituents. For every additional carbon-
carbon bond formed in a molecule, two fewer covalent bonds to hydrogen are formed.
When neighboring carbons share four valence electrons to form a double bond, the resulting
hydrocarbon is called an alkene. Alkenes are characterized by these chemically interesting
double bonds, which are more reactive than single carbon-carbon bonds (see Chapter 5 for 
a review of sigma and pi bonding). Double bonds also change the shape of a hydrocarbon,
because the sp2 hybridized valence orbitals assume a trigonal planar geometry, as shown by
the carbons of ethene in Figure 21-4. Saturated carbon is sp3 hybridized and has tetrahedral
geometry (again, see Chapter 5 to review hybridization).
Naming alkenes is slightly more complicated than naming alkanes. In addition to the number
of carbons in the main chain and any branching substituents, you must also note the loca-
tion of the double bonds in an alkene and incorporate that information into the name. Never-
theless, the essential naming strategy for alkenes is quite similar to that for alkanes in the
previous section:
1. Locate the longest carbon chain, and number it, starting at the end closest to the
double bond.
In other words, double bonds trump substituents when it comes to numbering the
parent chain. Build the name of the parent chain by using the same prefixes as used for
alkanes (refer to Table 21-1), but match the prefix with the suffix –ene. A three-carbon
chain with a double bond, for example, is called “propene.”
2. Number and name substituents that branch off the alkene in the same way that you
do for alkanes.
List the number of the substituted carbon, followed by the name of the substituent.
Separate the substituent number and name with a hyphen.
3. Identify the lowest numbered carbon that participates in the double bond, and put
that number between the substituent names and the parent chain name (sand-
wiched by hyphens), but after all the substituent names.
For example, if the second and third carbons of a five-carbon alkene engage in a double
bond, then the molecule is called 2-pentene, not 3-pentene. If that same molecule has a
methyl substituent at the third carbon, then the molecule is called 3-methyl-2-pentene.

Part V: Going Organic 

Alternately, and especially when there are substituents present, the position of an
unsaturation is indicated between the prefix and suffix of the parent chain name. So, 
3-methyl-2-pentene may also be written 3-methylpent-2-ene.
Alkynes are hydrocarbons in which neighboring carbons share six electrons to engage in
triple covalent bonds. The naming strategy for alkynes is the same as that for alkenes, except
that the alkyne parent chain is named by matching the prefix with the suffix –yne.
The trick to drawing hydrocarbons is to start at the end of the name and work backwards.
The prefix preceding the –ane, –ene, or –yne ending always tells you how many carbons are
in the longest chain, so begin by drawing that parent chain. From there, work through the
substituent groups, tacking them on as you go. Finally, add hydrogens into the structure
wherever there are empty bonds, and voilá! A portrait of a hydrocarbon.

The alkene is 2-methyl-2-butene (or 2-methylbut-2-ene); the alkyne is 1-butyne. The figure
on the left shows a four-carbon alkene with the double bond between the second and third
carbon atoms. Numbering the chain from either side yields the same numbers with respect
to the double bond. However, numbering from right to left gives a lower number to the
methyl substituent, so the compound is 2-methyl-2-butene (or 2-methylbut-2-ene). The figure
on the right shows a four-carbon alkyne, with the triple bond located between the first and
second carbon atoms. There are no substituents. The compound is therefore 1-butyne.

Rounding ’em Up: Circular Carbon Chains
The compounds we cover earlier in this chapter are linear or branched. However, hydrocar-
bons can be circular, or cyclical. Among the cyclical carbons, there are two important cate-
gories, the cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons and the aromatic hydrocarbons.
Chemists sometimes divide hydrocarbons into aliphatic and aromatic categories to highlight
important differences in structure and reactivity. Without going into more technical detail
than is useful here, aliphatic molecules and aromatic molecules have significantly different
electronic configurations (which electrons go into which orbitals). As a result, the two types
of hydrocarbons typically undergo different kinds of reactions. In particular, they tend to
undergo different kinds of substitution reactions, ones in which some atom or group substi-
tutes for hydrogen.
Wrapping your head around cyclic 
aliphatic hydrocarbons
Cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons are like the hydrocarbons that we explain earlier in this chap-
ter, except that they form a closed ring. The rules for naming these compounds build on the
rules we provide earlier in this chapter. For example, a cyclical six-carbon alkane includes
the name hexane, but is preceded by the prefix cyclo–, making the final name cyclohexane.

A single substituent or unsaturation on a cyclic aliphatic hydrocarbon doesn’t require a
number. So, a single bromine-for-hydrogen substitution on cyclohexane yields a compound
with the name bromocyclohexane. Likewise, a lone double bond unsaturation on cyclo-
hexane yields a compound with the name cyclohexene.
Multiple substitutions or unsaturations require numbering. In these cases, the same rules
apply for deciding the rank of substituents. Triple bonds outrank double bonds. Double
bonds outrank other substituents. So, number the carbons in the way that respects these
rankings and produces the lowest overall numbers. A cyclohexane molecule with two methyl
substituents on neighboring carbons, for example, is called 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane.
Sniffing out aromatic hydrocarbons
Aromatic hydrocarbons have special properties because of their electronic structure.
Aromatics are both cyclic and conjugated. Conjugation results from an alternation of double or
triple bonds with single bonds. Noncyclic hydrocarbons can be conjugated, too, but they can’t
be aromatic. Aromatic molecules have clouds of delocalized pi electrons, electrons that move
freely through a set of overlapping p orbitals. The model aromatic compound is benzene, the
resonance structures for which are depicted in Chapter 5. Because of its cyclical, conjugated
bonding, pi electrons delocalize evenly into rings above and below the plane of the flat benzene
molecule. Aromatic compounds are very stable compared to their aliphatic counterparts.
Numbering substituents on aromatics follows the same basic pattern as followed for cyclic
aliphatic compounds. A single substituent requires no numbering, as in bromobenzene.
Multiple substituents are numbered by rank, with the highest-ranked substituent placed on
carbon number one, and proceeding in a way that results in the lowest overall numbers. A
benzene ring with chlorine and methyl substituents situated two carbons away from one
another, for example, would be called 1-chloro-3-methylbenzene.

Q.
Name the following cyclic hydrocarbon:
A.
3-methylcyclohexene. The structure is a six-carbon cyclic alkene with a methyl substituent.
Numbering starts with the highest priority group, which is the double bond. Number so 
that the carbons of the double bond receive numbers 1 and 2, and the carbon to which the
methyl group is attached gets the lowest possible number. This means numbering counter-
clockwise as shown in the figure. The name of the compound is 3-methylcyclohexene. You
don’t need to specify the number of the carbon where the double bond appears; because
it’s the highest-ranking feature, the double bond is assumed to start at carbon number one.

Answers to Questions on Carbon Chains
Do you feel like you’re on the straight and narrow path to understanding carbon
chains, or do you feel like you’ve been running around in circles? Take a deep breath,
relax, and check your answers to the practice problems presented in this chapter.
a
The structure is propane; its molecular formula is C3H8. The figure shows a three-carbon
chain with only single bonds. Therefore, it is propane. Its molecular formula is C3H8.
b
The oct– prefix here tells you that this alkane is eight carbons long. Draw eight linked carbons
and fill in the empty bonds with hydrogen. Your structure should look like this one:
c
4-ethyl-3-methyl-5-propylnonane. The structure shown is a nine-carbon alkane, so its parent
chain name is nonane. Begin numbering from the end that gives the substituent groups the
lowest numbers. A one-carbon group extends from the third carbon (3-methyl), a two-carbon
group extends from the fourth carbon (4-ethyl), and a three-carbon group extends from the fifth
carbon (5-propyl). Alphabetize these substituents and tack on the nonane ending, and you have
4-ethyl-3-methyl-5-propylnonane.
d
2,2-dimethylpropane. Note that this is the proper systematic name, and that other common
names may also be used. The common name for this structure is neopentane.
e
The name 3,4-diethyl-5-propyldecane tells you first and foremost that this compound is a ten-
carbon alkane. The substituent names indicate two ethyl groups extending from the third and
fourth carbons and a propyl group extending from the fifth carbon in the chain. So your art-

The heptane ending tells you that you’re dealing with a seven-carbon alkane here, so begin by
drawing a seven-carbon parent chain. Next, attach the substituents to the main chain by decod-
ing their names. 3-propyl tells you that a three-carbon substituent group extends from the third
carbon in the chain, and 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl tells you that four single-carbon substituent groups
are attached to the chain, two on the second carbon and two on the fourth. Your drawing
should look like this:
g
5,5-diethyl-2-methyl-3-heptene (or 5,5-diethyl-2-methylhept-3-ene). Note first that this struc-
ture contains a double bond, meaning it’s an alkene and will end with the suffix –ene. It has
seven carbons in the parent chain, so its base name is heptene. In general, you begin numbering
the chain at the end closest to the double bond because it has the highest priority. However, in
this case, the double bond is between carbons three and four (so it’s 3-heptene) no matter
which end you begin numbering from. The substituents serve as the tiebreaker here to help
you decide whether to number from the left or the right. Choose the end that yields the lowest
substituent numbers and then name the substituents. You should get 5,5-diethyl-2-methyl-3-
heptene (or 5,5-diethyl-2-methylhept-3-ene).
h
The ending 3-octyne tells you that this compound is an eight-carbon alkyne with the triple bond
between the third and fourth carbons. The substituent names 5-ethyl and 5-methyl tell you that
the chain includes both a two-carbon (ethyl) and a one-carbon (methyl) branch off the fifth
carbon. If your drawing looks like the following figure, you’ve done well.

The ending 3-pentene tells you that this compound is a five-carbon alkene with the double bond
between the second and third carbons. The substituent name 4,4-dimethyl tells you that two single-
carbon substituent groups are present, both extending from the fourth carbon in the chain. Your art-
work should look like the following figure:

3,3-dimethylcyclopropene. This is a five-carbon cyclic alkene with two methyl substituents. Number
the ring so the two carbons sharing the double bond receive the numbers 1 and 2, and the methyl
substituents receive the lowest number. Doing so causes the two methyl groups to extend from the
carbon numbered 3. The name is therefore 3,3-dimethylcyclopropene.
k
The ending cyclopentene indicates that this is a five-carbon cyclic alkene. Draw a five-carbon ring con-
taining a single double bond and number around the ring so the two carbons sharing the double bond
receive the numbers 1 and 2. Then attach a one-carbon substituent group to the carbon numbered 4.

ow about this: Two organic molecules have identical chemical formulas. Each atom in
one molecule is bonded to the same groups as in the other. They’re identical molecules,
right? Wrong! (Mischievous chemistry gods point and snicker.) Many organic molecules are
isomers, compounds with the same formula and types of bonds, but with different structural
or spatial arrangements. Who cares about such subtle differences? Well, you might. Consider
thalidomide, a small organic molecule widely prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s
and early 1960s as a treatment for morning sickness. Thalidomide exists in two isomeric forms
that rapidly switch from one to the other in the body. One isomer is very effective at combat-
ing morning sickness. The other isomer causes serious birth defects. Isomers matter.
Isomers can be confusing. They fall into different categories and subcategories. So, before
committing your brain to a game of isomeric Twister, peruse the following breakdown:
 Structural isomers have identical molecular formulas but differ in the arrangement of bonds.
 Stereoisomers have identical connectivities — all atoms are bonded to the same types of
other atoms — but differ in the arrangement of atoms in space.
• Diastereomers are stereoisomers that are not non-superimposable mirror images
of each other. Two types of diastereomers exist: Geometric isomers (or cis-trans
isomers) are diastereomers that differ in the arrangement of groups around a
double bond, or the plane of a ring. Conformers and rotamers are diastereomers
that differ because of rotations about individual bonds (we don’t cover them in
this book because they’re beyond the scope of general chemistry).
• Enantiomers are stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of
each other.
Chapter 21 neatly handles structural isomers, describing how to recognize and name them
appropriately. This chapter focuses on the trickier category: stereoisomers.
Picking Sides with Geometric Isomers
Geometric isomers or cis-trans isomers are a good place to start in the world of stereoisomers
because they’re the easiest of the stereoisomers to understand. In the following sections, we
explain how isomers relate to alkenes, alkanes that aren’t straight-chain, and alkynes (see
Chapter 21 for an introduction to these structures).

Alkenes: Keen on cis-trans configurations
Straight-chain alkanes are immune from geometric isomerism because their carbon-carbon
single bonds can rotate freely. Unsaturate (or add another bond to) one of those bonds, how-
ever, and you’ve got a different story. Alkenes have double bonds that resist rotation.
Furthermore, the sp2 hybridization of double-bonded carbons gives them trigonal planar
bonding geometry (see Chapter 5 for an introduction to hybridization). The result is that
groups attached to these carbons are locked on one side or the other of the double bond.
Convince yourself of this by examining Figure 22-1.
In Figure 22-1a, the carbon chain continues along the same side of the carbon-carbon double
bond. Both methyl (-CH3) groups lie on the same side of the unsaturation. This is called a cis
configuration. In Figure 22-1b, the carbon chain swaps sides as it proceeds across the double
bond. The methyl groups lie on opposite sides of the unsaturation. This is called a trans
configuration.
Naming cis-trans isomers is simple. Attach the appropriate cis– or trans– prefix before the
number referring to the carbon of the double bond (refer to Chapter 21 if you don’t know how
to name alkenes). For example, Figure 22-1a is cis-2-butene, while Figure 22-1b is trans-2-butene.
Alkanes that aren’t straight-chain: 
Making a ringside bond
Although straight-chain alkanes happily avoid isomerism by rotating merrily about their single
bonds, the four bonds of sp3-hybridized carbons assume tetrahedral geometry. Detailed repre-
sentations like the one shown for methane in Figure 22-2 reveal this geometry. In the structure
of methane, the bonds depicted as straight lines run in the plane of the page. The bond drawn
as a filled wedge projects outward from the page. The bond drawn as a dashed wedge projects
behind the page. These filled and dashed wedge symbols are known as stereo bonds because
they’re helpful in identifying stereoisomers.
When alkanes close into rings, they can no longer freely rotate about their single bonds, and
the tetrahedral geometry of sp3-hybridized carbons creates cis-trans isomers. Groups bonded

to ring carbons are locked above or below the plane of the ring, as shown in Figure 22-3. The
figure depicts two different versions of trans-1,2-dimethylcyclohexane. In both versions, the
adjacent methyl substituents are locked in trans positions, on opposite sides of the ring.
 The upper set of structures shows the plane of the ring as seen from above and high-
lights the trans– configuration of the methyl groups with stereo bonds.
 The lower set of structures shows the same rings rotated 90 degrees downward and
toward you.
The trans configuration of the methyl groups is most clear in the lower structures. The front-
most methyl group is highlighted with explicit hydrogen atoms to emphasize its position
above or below the plane of the ring. (Astute readers may ponder, if both are trans, why are
they different? The answer to this mystery lies in the upcoming “Staring into the Mirror with
Enantiomers and Diastereomers” section.)
Alkynes: No place to create stereoisomers
Alkynes also contain carbon-carbon bonds that can’t rotate freely. However, the sp hybridiza-
tion of the carbons in these bonds leads to linear bonding geometry. The two-carbon alkyne,
ethyne, is shown in Figure 22-4. Each carbon locks three of its valence electrons into the axis
of the triple bond. Each has only one valence electron remaining with which to bond to
hydrogen. No cis-trans isomerism is possible in this scenario.

Staring into the Mirror with Enantiomers 
and Diastereomers
Geometric isomers are really just prominent types of stereoisomers, compounds that differ
only by the arrangement of groups in space. Geometric isomers belong in the category of
diastereomers, stereoisomers that aren’t non-superimposable mirror images. This section
introduces a devilish category of stereoisomers called enantiomers, isomers that are non-
superimposable mirror images of each other. Telling the difference between enantiomers and
diastereomers can take some practice. You can practice here.
Getting a grip on chirality
Not all mirror images are superimposable on one another. This fact is so fundamental that it
may have escaped your attention. If you doubt the truth of it, just try this: Extend your fin-
gers and thumbs so that each hand makes an L-shape. (You’ve just synthesized two L-shaped
molecules — well done.) Now, try to orient your L-shaped hand-molecules so both palms
face upwards and so your fingers and thumbs all point in the same directions . . . at the same
time. It can’t be done without serious injury. That’s because your L-shaped hand-molecules
are chiral, meaning they have the property of non-superimposability with their mirror
images. Molecules must be chiral in order to be enantiomers.
Carbon atoms can be chiral, too. When sp3-hybridized carbons bond to four different groups,
those carbons have chiral geometry and can form chiral centers within molecules. Compare
the two molecules shown in Figure 22-5, remembering to visualize the projections of the
stereo bonds drawn as wedges (see the earlier section “Alkanes that aren’t straight-chain:
Making a ringside bond” for more details). Rotate the molecules in your mind, trying to
superimpose them. Although this is potentially a safer experiment than trying to superim-
pose your hands, it stands no greater chance of success. Chirality is what it is.
Molecules with chiral centers are often — not always — chiral. Chiral molecules often — not
always — possess chiral centers. Chiral centers are important enough that you should
understand what they are and seek them out.

Depicting enantiomers and diastereomers 
in Fischer projections
Chains of tetrahedral carbon atoms show up so frequently in organic molecules that
chemists have devised shorthand methods for drawing their structures. One such method is
the Fischer projection. Fischer projections are a simple way to condense the three-dimen-
sional reality of tetrahedral carbon onto a two-dimensional page.
In a Fischer projection, a bonded chain of tetrahedral carbon atoms is depicted as a vertical
line. Horizontal lines represent other bonds projecting from these central carbon atoms.
Each intersection between lines represents one carbon atom. Vertical lines symbolize bonds
that project away from you. Horizontal lines represent bonds that project toward you.
Examples of two molecules drawn as Fischer projections are shown in Figure 22-6.
Fischer projections are convenient, but you have to be careful when using them to visualize
bonds to make decisions about whether something is chiral.
 First, you can only rotate these structures in the plane of the page. Don’t try to rotate
them out of the page, or they’ll lose all their meaning.
 Second, only consider one carbon center at a time. If you try to simultaneously visualize
the three-dimensional bonding of two adjacent carbon atoms on the vertical chain,
you’ll only get yourself into trouble, and you may well burst a blood vessel.
With those caveats in mind, take a closer look at the two structures in Figure 22-6. Do you see
how no amount of sliding or rotating them in the plane of the page can superimpose them?
That’s because these two molecules are enantiomers.
Compare that situation with the one presented by the two molecules shown in Figure 22-7.
Do you see how rotating one of the molecules 180 degrees in the plane of the page allows you
to superimpose the two? That’s because these two molecules are diastereomers.

You protest — how can it be? Both sets of molecules contain chiral centers! That’s true, but
remember: Not all molecules with chiral centers are themselves chiral. In fact, a special term
exists for these chiral-but-not-chiral molecules. They are called meso compounds. Many meso
compounds pull off this trick by having an internal plane of symmetry. In other words, they
are their own mirrors. Narcissistic little buggers.

Answers to Questions on Stereoisomers
a
4-methyl-trans-4-nonene. The structure contains a nine-carbon parent chain, with a double
bond occurring between carbon atoms 4 and 5. The main chain swaps sides of the unsaturation
as it proceeds. The molecule is also substituted at the fourth carbon with a methyl group.
b
Trans-2-pentene is a five-carbon alkene with the double bond occurring between the second
and third carbon atoms. The parent chain proceeds along opposite sides of the carbon-carbon
double bond, as shown in the following figure:
c
The cis– and trans– isomers of 3-heptene differ only in the orientation of the carbon chain about
the double bond, as shown in the following figure:
d
Consider the structure of 1-butene, shown in the following figure:
The chain terminates at the double bond. The first carbon atom is bonded to two identical
hydrogen atoms. No unique substituent group lies cis or trans to the continuing parent chain.
e
This is partially a trick question. (Hey! At least we admitted it.) Although the structure has
chiral centers, proper drawing of the Fischer projection (pay attention to stereo bonds!), seen
in the following figure, makes it clear that the compound is meso. The molecule has an internal
plane of symmetry.

The two structures shown in Figure A are enantiomers, although they don’t appear to be at
first glance. To make the enantiomeric relationship more obvious, rotate one of them 180
degrees in the plane of the page. The two structures in Figure B are not enantiomers. In fact,
this is a meso compound.
g
The structures shown in Figures A and B are meso compounds. The structures shown in
Figure C are not meso. Although the structures in Figure A don’t have an internal plane of sym-
metry, the two are superimposable mirror images. The structures in Figure B have an internal
plane of symmetry and, in fact, are the same compound. The two structures in Figure C are non-
superimposable mirror images, and are therefore enantiomers.
h
The structure in Figure A is a geometric isomer, trans-2-hexene. The pair of molecules
shown in Figure B are different orientations of a meso compound with two chiral centers
and an internal plane of symmetry, as shown in the following figure. The plane cuts the 
molecule in half, across the bond connecting the second and third carbon atoms. The pair of
structures in Figure C are enantiomers. The chiral center in this case isn’t carbon! Rather, it’s
silicon, which sits right below carbon on the periodic table, and also bonds with tetrahedral
geometry. The pair of molecules shown in Figure D aren’t isomers at all, but are simply differ-
ent orientations of the amino acid glycine. The central carbon of the projection bonds to two
identical hydrogen atoms, so no isomerism is possible.

I
t’s no coincidence that in this, the final chapter that covers new material, we introduce
two of the most fascinating and relevant branches of modern chemistry: organic chem-
istry and biochemistry. We have chosen to do this not because we’re malevolent human
beings who want to rub in that you still have an awfully long way to go in your study of
chemistry, but rather because we want to point out that the skills and information that you
have gained from this book open the door to a whole new world of science.
What do organic chemistry and biochemistry have in common? Much of biochemistry is
organic chemistry, making and breaking bonds in carbon-based compounds. Many com-
pounds involved in biochemistry are based on hydrocarbon skeletons, but are embellished
with functional groups. These groups include noncarbon elements and give organic com-
pounds a dizzying array of different properties. In this chapter, we explain the basics of how
functional groups operate in organic chemistry and biochemistry.
You already know a little about organic chemistry from Chapters 21 and 22, and surely
you’ve noticed that those chapters cover compounds made entirely of hydrogen and carbon.
Rest assured that we go beyond hydrocarbons in this chapter! Because hydrocarbons are old
news, we sometimes refer to them in this chapter simply by using the letter R, representing
any hydrocarbon group: branched or unbranched, saturated or unsaturated.
Meeting the Cast of Chemical Players
In Chapters 21 and 22, you focus intently on hydrocarbons. In fact, you process so much
information about those amazing compounds in the previous two chapters that you may
forget that the periodic table contains more than 100 other elements. Although organic
chemistry often concentrates on just a few of those elements, you need to be familiar with
many other compound types, and this time they’re made of more than just hydrogen and
carbon. All of these exotic new compounds contain plain vanilla carbon chains, but each has
a distinguishing feature composed of another, more exotic element.

Table 23-1 summarizes the compounds in the following sections, their distinguishing fea-
tures, and their endings. Some molecules, including some of the biological monomers that
are introduced in the later section “Seeing Chemistry at Work in Biology,” contain more than
one of these distinguishing features. Locations where one of these groups or a multiple bond
appears are prime sites for reactions to occur. These sites are therefore called functional
groups. Carefully study the functional group column in Table 23-1 so you can recognize them
quickly. These are the structures you should keep an eye out for later in this chapter.

Alcohols: Hosting a hydroxide
Alcohols are hydrocarbons with a hydroxyl group attached to them. Their general form is 
R-OH. To name an alcohol, you simply count the longest number of consecutive carbon
atoms in the chain, find its prefix in the table of hydrocarbon prefixes in Chapter 21, and
then attach the ending –ol to that prefix. For example, a one-carbon chain with an OH group
attached is methanol, two is ethanol, three is propanol, and so on.
Substituents (groups branching off the main chain) must, as always, be accounted for, and
you must specify the number of the carbon atom in the chain to which the hydroxyl (OH)
group is attached. Begin your numbering at the end of the chain closest to the OH, and
attach the number before the prefix + –ol. For example, the compound shown in Figure 23-1
contains a six-carbon chain with a hydroxyl group. Its base name is therefore hexanol. It has
methyl groups (with one carbon each) on the second and fourth carbons and its OH group
lies on the third carbon. Its proper name is therefore 2,4-dimethyl-3-hexanol.
Ethers: Invaded by oxygen
Perhaps most commonly known for their use as early anesthetics, ethers are carbon chains
that have been infiltrated by an oxygen atom. These oxygen atoms lie conspicuously in the
middle of a carbon chain like badly disguised spies in an enemy camp. They have the general
formula R-O-R. Ethers are named by naming the alkyl groups on either side of the lone oxygen

Chapter 23: Moving through the Functional Groups

as substituent groups individually (adding the ending –yl to their prefixes), and then attach-
ing the word ether to the end. For example, the compound shown in Figure 23-2 is an ether
with a methyl group (one carbon) on one side of the oxygen and an ethyl (two carbons) on
the other. Placing the substituents in alphabetical order, the compound’s proper name is
ethyl methyl ether.
Oxygen atoms in ethers are often surrounded by two identical alkyl groups, in which case the
prefix di– must be attached to the name of that substituent. For example, an oxygen sur-
rounded by two propyl groups (with three carbons each) is called dipropyl ether.
Carboxylic acids: –COOH brings up the rear
Carboxylic acids appear to be ordinary hydrocarbons until you reach the very last carbon in
their chain, whose three ordinary hydrogens have been usurped by a double-bonded oxygen
and a hydroxyl group (an OH group). This gives a carboxylic acid the general form R-COOH.
These compounds are named by attaching the suffix –oic acid to the end of the prefix. For
example, the compound shown in Figure 23-3 has four carbons, the last in the chain attached
to a double-bonded oxygen and a hydroxyl group. The compound is therefore called
butanoic acid. The hydrogen of the COOH group can pop off as H+, which is why these com-
pounds are called acids.
Esters: Creating two carbon chains
What if the same double-bonded oxygen/hydroxyl pair from a carboxylic acid has infiltrated
deeper into the hydrocarbon chain and is not on an end, but rather in the middle? In order 
to accomplish this, the COOH group must lose the hydrogen of its hydroxyl group (which, as
an acidic hydrogen, is no problem) to open up a bond to which a second hydrocarbon can
attach. A compound of this nature, with the general formula R-COOR, is called an ester.
Because the carbon chain in an ester is also broken by an oxygen, you need to choose one
carbon chain as a lowly substituent group and the other to bear the proud suffix of –oate.
This high-priority group is always the carbon chain that includes the carbon double bonded

to one oxygen and single bonded to the other. The group on the other side of the single-
bonded oxygen is named as an ordinary substituent. For example, the compound shown in
Figure 23-4 is phenyl ethanoate, because the high-priority group has two carbons and the
low-priority group is a benzene ring.
That’s right! The low-priority group on the other side of the oxygen doesn’t have to be a hydro-
carbon chain! It can be a ring or a metal as well. In Figure 23-4, this group is a benzene ring.
Aldehydes: Holding tight to one oxygen
Aldehydes are much like carboxylic acids except that they lack the second oxygen in the
COOH group. Their final carbon shares a single bond with its neighboring carbon, a double
bond with an oxygen, and a single bond with hydrogen. Aldehydes are named with the suffix
–al (not to be confused with the –ol of alcohols) and have the general formula R-CHO. For
example, the compound in Figure 23-5 is pentanal, a five-carbon chain with a double-bonded
oxygen taking the place of two of the hydrogen bonds on the final carbon.
Ketones: Lone oxygen sneaks up the chain
Much like esters are to carboxylic acids, ketones share the same basic structure as alde-
hydes, except that their double-bonded oxygen can be found hiding out in the midst of the
carbon chain, giving them the general form R-COR. Ketones are named by adding the suffix
–one to the prefix generated by counting up the longest carbon chain. Unlike esters, however,
the carbon chain of a ketone isn’t broken by the double-bonded oxygen group, which makes
naming them much simpler. The compound shown in Figure 23-6, for example, is called
simply 2-butanone; the number before the name specifies the number of the carbon to which
the oxygen is attached.

Halocarbons: Hello, halogens!
Halocarbons are simply hydrocarbons with one or more halogens tacked on in place of a
hydrogen atom. (A halogen is a group VIIA element.) Halogens in a halocarbon are always
named as substituent groups — fluoro–, chloro–, bromo–, or iodo–, one for each of the four
halogens that form halocarbons (F, Cl, Br, or I). The shorthand for a halocarbon is R-X, where
X is the halogen. The compound shown in Figure 23-7 has two bromo groups attached, one
stemming from the second carbon and one from the third in a five-carbon alkane. Its official
name is, therefore, 2,3-dibromopentane. (See Chapter 21 for more details on naming alkanes.)
Amines: Hobnobbing with nitrogen
Amines are as conspicuous as Waldo on the very first page of a Where’s Waldo book. No trick-
sters wearing red-striped shirts are waiting to fool you among these organic molecules. Amines
and their derivatives are the only compounds that you encounter in basic organic chemistry
that contain nitrogen atoms. Amines have the basic form R-NH2, and they’re named by naming
the carbon chain as a substituent (with the ending –yl), and then adding the suffix –amine. The
structure in Figure 23-8, for example, is called ethylamine because it’s a two-carbon ethyl
chain with an amine group.

Q.
Draw the structure and write the condensed formula for 3,4-dimethyl heptanoic acid.
A.
The condensed formula is CH3CH2CH2CH3CHCH3CHCH2COOH. The ending –oic acid tells
you that you’re dealing with a carboxylic acid, and the prefix hept– tells you that the carbon
chain on the end of the carboxylic acid functional group is seven carbons long. Finally, the
3,4-dimethyl tells you that the molecule has two single-carbon substituent groups, one on
the third carbon in the chain and one on the fourth. Remember to number the chain starting
from the carbon that is bonded to the oxygens. Add all of these bits of information together
and you get the structure shown in the following figure, which has the condensed formula

Reacting by Substitution and Addition
The carbon-based organic molecules in the previous section can morph into one another
through chemical reactions. Such reactions are rather common. Alcohols, for example, are
prone to a chemical process called substitution in which their OH group is replaced by a dif-
ferent atom. For example, the OH group on 2-pentanol can be replaced by the halogen fluo-
rine, turning the alcohol into a halocarbon called 2-fluoro-pentane (see Figure 23-9).
The double bonds of alkenes also make them particularly likely to react with other com-
pounds through a process called addition. If the double bond between two carbon molecules
is broken, it allows each of those two carbon atoms to form a bond with another atom or
molecule. The reaction shown in Figure 23-10, for example, shows water being added across
the double bond of 1-hexene. The water molecule itself is split into two pieces — simple

Seeing Chemistry at Work in Biology
All the compounds that we discuss earlier in this chapter are relatively small molecules. We
haven’t even given you a prefix for a carbon chain with more than ten carbon atoms. Yet
many fundamental organic compounds contain chains of carbons tens and hundreds and
thousands long, with lots of hydrogens, nitrogens, and oxygens tacked on along the way.
These giant molecules, also known as polymers, are built by taking smaller units called
monomers and joining them together like joining train cars to make a longer train. Just as
trains can be constructed with a variety of railcar sequences, polymers can be constructed
with a series of identical monomers or with a mixture of two or more different monomers.
Each time another monomer unit is added to a polymer chain, it changes the compound’s
physical properties, such as stiffness and boiling point. Although they may seem fairly com-
plicated and difficult to make, polymers aren’t rare. Your milk jug, shampoo bottle, rubber
duckie, and flame-retardant suit are all made of polymers. In fact, all of the compounds that
we commonly refer to as plastics are polymers, and manufacturers routinely use chemistry
to achieve desirable properties in the plastics they use. Reactions which link monomers to
make a polymer are called polymerization reactions.
Plastics and rubber aren’t the end-all, be-all of polymers however. The human body contains
a whole slew of naturally occurring polymers, which you encounter when you look at the
nutrition facts on the back of your box of morning cereal. Carbohydrates, proteins, and many
lipids are polymers. So too are the DNA and RNA that store and transmit your genetic code.
In the following sections, we focus on several important biological polymers: carbohydrates,
proteins, and nucleic acids.
Note that in all the reactions in the following sections, the two monomers being linked
together lose an oxygen and two hydrogens to create the polymer. Because this essentially
amounts to the loss of a water molecule between the two monomers, the process is called
dehydration or condensation reaction.
Carbohydrates: Carbon meets water
Carbohydrates are polymers made up of aldehyde and ketone monomers (see the earlier 
sections on these two types of compounds). As such, they may contain only the elements
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Categories of carbohydrates include starches and sugars, and
sugars themselves fall into three categories: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccha-
rides. Because saccharide is simply a fancy name for sugar, it follows that these compounds
are made of one, two, and more than two sugar monomers, respectively. The general formula
for a carbohydrate is C(H2O)n, whether you are dealing with a monosaccharide or a polysac-
charide that is hundreds of sugars long.
Glucose, the product of photosynthesis in plants (see Figure 23-11), is arguably the most
important biological monosaccharide. Glucose monomers can be combined to make a variety
of polysaccharides, including starches (which provide the primary source of carbohydrates in
pasta and potatoes) and cellulose (which makes up cell walls in plant cells). Figure 23-12 shows
two monosaccharides combining to form a disaccharide.
311
Chapter 23: Moving through the Functional Groups

Proteins: Built from amino acids
The monomers that make up proteins are called amino acids (see one in Figure 23-13). The
amino acid’s identity is determined by the structure of the side chain R, which can be any of
a variety of organic structures. Individual amino acids are linked together into polymers
through the formation of peptide bonds. A polymer made of two amino acids is therefore
called a dipeptide (see Figure 23-14), while more than two amino acids form a polypeptide.

The proteins in the human body (or those in an octopus or a bacterium) are made up of 20
common amino acids. Every protein type is constructed of a unique sequence of amino
acids, and your DNA tells your body how to manufacture the proteins it needs by specifying
this sequence.
Nucleic acids: The backbones of life
DNA and RNA are extremely important biological polymers. They are constructed of smaller
subunits called nucleotides (see Figure 23-15), which make up the polymers called nucleic
acids (see Figure 23-16). Each nucleotide consists of three parts: a phosphoric acid, a sugar,
and a nitrogen-containing base. DNA nucleotides use the sugar deoxyribose and employ four
types of base. RNA nucleotides use the sugar ribose and employ a nearly identical set of
bases. Bases are broken up into two categories:
 Pyrimidines are characterized by a single ring of carbon and nitrogen atoms.
 Purines contain a double ring.

Answers to Questions on Functional Groups
The following are the answers to the practice problems in this chapter.
a
a. 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone. The longest carbon chain in this structure is five carbons long, and
the lone double-bonded oxygen in the middle of the carbon chain tells you that this compound
is a ketone. Its basic name is 2-butanone. It also has two methyl substituents, both off the
number three carbon. The proper name for the structure is, therefore, 3,3-dimethyl-2-butanone.
b. Ethanoic acid. The second structure also has a double-bonded oxygen; however, it appears
on the end of a two-carbon chain. Compound b is the carboxylic acid called ethanoic acid.
b
The name 4,4,5-triethyl 3-heptanol tells you that you’re dealing with a seven-carbon alcohol
whose hydroxyl group stems from the third carbon in the chain, and that it has three ethyl 
substituent groups (two off the fourth carbon and one off the fifth). This should lead you to 
structure a in the following figure. The name 3,4,5-triethyl octanal, on the other hand, is an 
eight-carbon aldehyde, also with three ethyl substituent groups (this time with one off the third
carbon, one off the fourth, and one off the fifth). Check it out in structure b in the following figure.
c
a. 1-phenyl-1- propanol. The longest carbon chain in this structure is three carbons long. The
final carbon in that chain has both an alcohol and a phenyl group extending from it. The alco-
hol group gives the compound the basic name propanol, and adding the phenyl substituent,
you should arrive at the name 1-phenyl-1-propanol.
b. Diphenyl ether. Structure b is an ether with two identical phenyl groups surrounding the
oxygen, making it diphenyl ether.
d

3-bromo-2-chloro-1-butene. This structure is a halocarbon. The longest carbon chain is four
carbons long, and it’s an alkene, making the base name butene (see Chapter 21 for details on
naming alkenes). Numbering from the side closest to the double bond yields the lowest overall
numbers; therefore, the compound is 3-bromo-2-chloro-1-butene.
f
2-methyl butylamine is a four-carbon amine with a methyl substituent off its second carbon. It
has the structure shown in the following figure.
g
3-octanol and diatomic chlorine. A halocarbon with a halogen extending from the third carbon
of an eight-carbon chain (otherwise known as 3-chlorooctane) was most likely created in a sub-
stitution reaction during which 3-octanol reacted with diatomic chlorine to produce 3-chlorooc-
tane. This is true because a substituent hydroxyl group is quite likely to be replaced in a
substitution reaction.
h
When 1-pentene is combined with water, an addition reaction is likely to occur in which the
double bond of pentene is broken, and a hydrogen and a hydroxide are added to the newly
freed carbons, forming either 1-pentanol or 2-pentanol.
i
Cytosine is a pyrimidine. You can tell because it contains a single ring of carbon and nitrogen
atoms, instead of a double ring.
j
The amino acid has an amine group and a carboxylic acid group, while the carbohydrate
has several alcohol groups and an ether group. Examining the structure of an amino acid
monomer in Figure 23-13 reveals that it contains both an amine group (–NH2) and a carboxylic
acid group (–COOH). As for carbohydrates, the monosaccharide glucose shown in Figure 23-11
has several alcohol (–OH) functional groups and an oxygen infiltrating the carbon ring (an ether
group).

or some, the mere presence of an equation is scary. Take consolation in this thought:
Understanding an equation saves you brain space because equations pack a whole lot
of explanation into one compact little sentence.
For example, say you need to remember what decreasing temperature does to the volume of
a gas when pressure is held constant. Maybe you’ll just remember. If not, you could try to
reason it out based on kinetic theory. That approach may not work for you either. But if you
simply remember the Combined Gas Law, you can figure it out simply by inspecting the equa-
tion. Not only that, but all other combinations of increasing or decreasing temperature, pres-
sure, and volume fall instantly within your grasp. Equations can be your friends. Your friends
have gathered to meet you in this chapter. Hang out for a while.
The Combined Gas Law
Using the following equation for the Combined Gas Law, which we introduce in Chapter 11,
you can calculate how a gas responds when one factor changes. Changing any one parameter
(temperature, T, pressure, P, or volume, V) affects another parameter when the third parame-
ter is held constant. To work the equation, first cancel out the constant parameter. Then plug
in the values for your known parameters. Finally, solve for the unknown.
Values with a subscripted 1 refer to initial states, and values with a subscripted 2 refer to
final states.

Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures
The following law, which we introduce in Chapter 11, is useful with mixtures of gases at con-
stant volume and temperature. Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures states that the total pres-
sure of the mixture is simply the sum of the partial pressures of each of the individual gases.
You can solve for the total pressure (Ptotal) or any individual partial pressure (P1, P2, and so
on) as long as you know all the other pressures.
Ptotal = P1 + P2 + P3 . . . +Pn
The Dilution Equation
The following relation works because the number of moles of a solute doesn’t change when
you dilute the solution. You can use the Dilution Equation to calculate an initial concentra-
tion or volume (M1, V1) or a final concentration or volume (M2, V2), as long as you know the
other three values. See Chapter 12 for more information on dilutions.
M1 × V1 = M2 × V2
Rate Laws
Rate laws, which we cover in Chapter 14, relate reaction rates to the concentrations of reac-
tants. Which rate law is appropriate depends on the kind of reaction involved. Zero-order
reactions have rates that don’t depend on reactant concentrations; first-order reactions
have rates that depend on the concentration of one reactant; and second-order reactions
have rates that depend on the concentrations of two reactants. Here are representative reac-
tion equations for zero-order, first-order, and second-order reactions.
Zero-order:
A →B
(rate is independent of [A])
First-order:
A →B
(rate depends on [A])
Second-order:
A + A →C
(rate depends on [A]), or
A + B →C
(rate depends on [A] and [B])
The rate laws for these reactions describe the rate at which reactant A disappears over time,
–d[A] / dt. Note that dX / dt is simply the rate at which X changes at any given moment in
time, t. Rate laws are expressed in terms of k, the rate constant:
Zero-order rate law:
rate = –d[A] / dt = k
First-order rate law:
rate = –d[A] / dt = k[A]
Second-order rate law:
rate = –d[A] / dt = k[A]2 or
rate = –d[A] / dt = k[A][B]
322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The Equilibrium Constant
You can calculate the equilibrium constant for a reaction, Keq, from the concentrations of
reactants and products at equilibrium. In the following reaction, for example, A and B are
reactants, C and D are products, and a, b, c, and d are stoichiometric coefficients (numbers
showing mole multiples in a balanced equation):
aA + bB ↔cC + dD
The equilibrium constant for the reaction is calculated as:
Note that [X] refers to the molar concentration of X; [0.7] = 0.7 mol L–1.
Spontaneous reactions have Keq values greater than 1. Nonspontaneous reactions have Keq
values between 0 and 1. The inverse of a Keq value is the Keq for the reverse reaction.
Check out Chapter 14 for more details about the equilibrium constant.
Free Energy Change
The free energy, G, is the amount of energy in a system available to do work. Usually, the
reactants and products of a chemical reaction possess different amounts of free energy.
So, the reaction proceeds with a change in energy between reactant and product states, 
∆G = Gproduct – Greactant. The change in free energy arises from an interplay between the change
in enthalpy, ∆H, and the change in entropy, ∆S:
∆G = ∆H – T∆S (where T is temperature)
Spontaneous reactions release energy, and occur with a negative ∆G. Nonspontaneous reac-
tions require an input of energy to proceed and occur with a positive ∆G.
The change in free energy associated with a reaction is related to the equilibrium constant
for that reaction (see the previous section for more about the equilibrium constant), so you
can interconvert between ∆G and Keq:
∆G = –RTlnKeq (R is the gas constant, T is temperature)
Note that “ln” stands for natural log (that is, log base e). You’ll find a button for ln on any
respectable scientific calculator.

Constant-Pressure Calorimetry
Calorimetry is the measurement of heat changes that accompany a reaction (see Chapter 15
for details). The important values to know are heat (q), mass (m), specific heat capacity (Cp),
and the change in temperature (∆T). If you know any three of these values, you can calculate
the fourth:
q = mCp∆T
Be sure that your units of heat, mass, and temperature match those used in your specific
heat capacity before attempting any calculations.
Hess’s Law
The heat taken up or released by a chemical process is the same whether the process occurs
in one or several steps. So, for a multistep reaction (at constant pressure), such as
A →B →C →D
the heats of the individual steps add up to equal the total heat for the reaction:
∆HA→D = ∆HA→B + ∆HB→C + ∆HC→D
So, you can calculate the overall change in heat, or the change in heat for any given step, as
long as you know all the other values. This formula is known as Hess’s Law.
Moreover, the reverse of any reaction occurs with the opposite change in heat:
∆HA→D = –∆HD→A
This means you can use known heat changes for reverse reactions simply by changing 
their signs.
Flip to Chapter 15 for the full scoop on Hess’s Law.
pH, pOH, and KW
As we explain in Chapter 16, pH and pOH are measurements of the acidity or basicity of
aqueous solutions:
pH = –log[H+]
pOH = –log[OH–]
Pure water spontaneously self-ionizes to a small degree
H2O(l) ↔H+(aq) + OH–(aq)
(note: H+ exists in water as H3O+)
324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

leading to equal concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxide ions (10–7 mol L–1). The product
of these two concentrations is the ion-product constant for water, Kw:
Kw = [H+] × [OH–] = (10–7) × (10–7) = 10–14
As a result, the pH and the pOH of pure water both equal 7. Acidic solutions have pH values
less than 7 and pOH values greater than 7. Basic (alkaline) solutions have pH values greater
than 7 and pOH values less than 7.
When you add an acid or base to an aqueous solution, the concentrations of hydrogen and
hydroxide ions shift in proportion so that the following is always true:
pH + pOH = 14
Ka and Kb
As we explain in Chapter 16, the Ka and Kb are equilibrium constants that measure the tend-
ency of weak acids and bases, respectively, to undergo ionization reactions in water.
For the dissociation reaction of a weak acid, HA
HA ↔H+ + A– (also written: HA + H2O ↔A– + H3O+)
the acid dissociation constant, Ka, is
Note that H3O+ may be used in place of H+.
For the dissociation reaction of a weak base, A–
A– + H2O ↔HA + OH–
the base dissociation constant, Kb, is
Note that B+ and BOH (base molecule, without or with OH–) may be used in place of HA and
A– (acid molecule, with or without H+).

Moreover, because Kw = [H+] × [OH–], it follows that
The stronger the acid or base, the larger the value of Ka or Kb, respectively.
It’s often useful to consider pKa or pKb, the negative log of Ka or Kb:
pKa = –logKa
pKb = –logKb
The pKa or pKb is equivalent to the pH at which half the acid or base has undergone the dis-
sociation reaction. This equivalence is reflected in the Henderson-Hasselbach equation,
which can be used to relate pH to the relative concentrations of a weak acid (HA) and its con-
jugate base (A–):

Ten Annoying Exceptions 
to Chemistry Rules
In This Chapter
 Putting all the annoying exceptions into one corral
 Handling exceptions more easily with tips and tricks
E
xceptions seem like nature’s way of hedging its bets. As such, they are annoying — why
can’t nature just go ahead and commit? But nature knows nothing of our rules, so it cer-
tainly isn’t going out of its way to annoy you. Nor is it going out of its way to make things
easier for you. Either way, seeing as you have to deal with exceptions, we thought we’d
corral many of them into this chapter so you can confront them more conveniently.
Hydrogen Isn’t an Alkali Metal
In the field of psychology, Maslow’s hierarchy of needs declares that people need a sense of
belonging. It’s a good thing hydrogen isn’t a person because it belongs nowhere on the peri-
odic table (which we describe in Chapter 4). Although hydrogen is usually listed atop Group
IA along with the alkali metals, it doesn’t really fit. Sure, hydrogen can lose an electron to
form a +1 cation, just like the alkali metals, but hydrogen can also gain an electron to form
hydride, H–, especially when bonding to metals. Furthermore, hydrogen doesn’t have metallic
properties, but typically exists as the diatomic gas, H2.
These differences arise largely from the fact that hydrogen has only a single 1s orbital and
lacks other, more interior orbitals that could shield the valence electrons from the positive
charge of the nucleus. (See Chapter 4 for an introduction to s and other types of orbitals.)
The Octet Rule Isn’t Always an Option
An octet, as we explain in Chapter 4, is a full shell of eight valence electrons. The octet rule
states that atoms bond with one another to acquire completely filled valence shells that con-
tain eight electrons. It’s a pretty good rule. Like most pretty good rules, it has exceptions.
 Atoms containing only 1s electrons simply don’t have eight slots to fill. So, hydrogen
and helium obey the “duet” rule.

 Certain molecules contain an odd number of valence electrons. In these cases, full
octets aren’t an option. Like people born with an odd number of toes, these molecules
may not be entirely happy with the situation, but they deal with it.
 Atoms often attempt to fill their valence shells by covalent bonding (see Chapter 5). Each
covalent bond adds a shared electron to the shell. But covalent bonding usually requires
an atom to donate an electron of its own for sharing within the bond. Some atoms run
out of electrons to donate, and therefore can’t engage in enough covalent bonds to fill
their shell octets. Boron trifluoride, BF3, is a typical example. The central boron atom 
of this molecule can only engage in three B–F bonds, and ends up with only six valence 
electrons. This boron is said to be electron deficient. You might speculate that the fluo-
rine atoms could pitch in a bit and donate some more electrons to boron. But fluorine 
is highly electronegative and greedily holds fast to its own octets. C’est la vie.
 Some atoms take on more than a full octet’s worth of electrons. These atoms are said to
be hypervalent or hypercoordinated. The phosphorus of phosphorus pentachloride, PCl5, 
is an example. These kinds of situations require an atom from period (row) 3 or higher
within the periodic table. The exact reasons for this restriction are still debated. Certainly,
the larger atomic size of period 3 and higher atoms allows more room to accommodate
the bulk of all the binding partners that distribute around the central atom’s valence shell.
Some Electron Configurations 
Ignore the Orbital Rules
Electrons fill orbitals from lowest energy to highest energy. This is true.
The progression of orbitals from lowest to highest energy is predicted by an Aufbau diagram.
This isn’t always true. Some atoms possess electron configurations that deviate from the
standard rules for filling orbitals from the ground up. For Aufbau’s sake, why?
Two conditions typically lead to exceptional electron configurations.
 First, successive orbital energies must lie close together, as is the case with 3d and 4s
orbitals, for example.
 Second, shifting electrons between these energetically similar orbitals must result in a
half-filled or fully filled set of identical orbitals, an energetically happy state of affairs.
Want a couple of examples? Strictly by the rules, chromium should have the following elec-
tron configuration:
[Ar]3d44s2
Because shifting a single electron from 4s to the energetically similar 3d level half-fills the 3d
set, the actual configuration of chromium is
[Ar]3d54s1
328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

For similar reasons, the configuration of copper is not the expected [Ar]3d94s2, but instead is
[Ar]3d104s1. Shifting a single electron from 4s to 3d fills the 3d set of orbitals.
Flip to Chapter 4 for full details on electron configurations and Aufbau diagrams.
One Partner in Coordinate Covalent Bonds
Giveth Electrons; the Other Taketh
To form a covalent bond (as we explain in Chapter 5), each bonding partner contributes one
electron to a two-electron bond, right? Not always. Coordinate covalent bonds are particularly
common between transition metals (which are mostly listed as group B elements on the peri-
odic table) and partners that possess lone pairs of electrons.
Here’s the basic idea: Transition metals have empty valence orbitals. Lone pairs are pairs of
nonbonding electrons within a single orbital. So, transition metals and lone-pair bearing mol-
ecules can engage in Lewis acid-base interactions (see Chapter 16). The lone-pair containing
molecule acts as an electron donor (a Lewis base), giving both electrons to a bond with the
metal, which acts as an electron acceptor (a Lewis acid). When this occurs, the resulting mol-
ecule is called a coordination complex.
The partners that bind to the metal are called ligands. Coordination complexes are often
intensely colored and can have properties that are quite different than those of the free metal.
All Hybridized Orbitals Are Created Equal
Different orbital types have grossly different shapes. Spherical s orbitals look nothing like
lobed p orbitals, for example. So, if the valence shell of an atom contains both s- and p-orbital
electrons, you might expect those electrons to behave differently when it comes to things
like bonding, right? Wrong. If you attempt to assume such a thing, valence bond theory
politely taps you on the shoulder to remind you that valence shell electrons occupy
hybridized orbitals. These hybridized orbitals (as in sp3, sp2, and sp orbitals) reflect a mixture
of the properties of the orbitals that make them up, and each of the orbitals is equivalent to
the others in the valence shell.
Although this phenomenon represents an exception to the rules, it’s somewhat less annoying
than other exceptions because hybridization allows for the nicely symmetrical orbital
geometries of actual atoms within actual molecules. VSEPR theory presently clears its throat
to point out that the negative charge of the electrons within the hybridized orbitals causes
those equivalent orbitals to spread as far apart as possible from one another. As a result, the
geometry of sp3-hybridized methane (CH4), for example, is beautifully tetrahedral.
Check out Chapter 5 for the details on VSEPR theory and hybridization.

Chapter 25: Ten Annoying Exceptions to Chemistry Rules

Use Caution When Naming Compounds 
with Transition Metals
The thing about transition metals is that the same transition metal can form cations with 
different charges. Differently charged metal cations need different names, so chemists don’t
get any more confused than they already are. These days, you indicate these differences by
using Roman numerals within parentheses to denote the positive charge of the metal ion. An
older method adds the suffixes –ous or –ic to indicate the cation with the smaller or larger
charge, respectively. For example:
Cu+ = copper (I) ion or cuprous ion
Cu2+ = copper (II) ion or cupric ion
Metal cations team up with nonmetal anions to form ionic compounds. What’s more, the
ratio of cations to anions within each formula unit depends on the charge assumed by the
fickle transition metal. The formula unit as a whole must be electrically neutral. The rules
you follow to name an ionic compound must accommodate the whims of transition metals.
The system of Roman numerals or suffixes applies in such situations:
CuCl = copper (I) chloride or cuprous chloride
CuCl2 = copper (II) chloride or cupric chloride
Chapter 6 has the full scoop on naming ionic and other types of compounds.
You Must Memorize Polyatomic Ions
Sorry, it’s true. Not only are polyatomic ions annoying because you have to memorize them,
but they pop up everywhere. If you don’t memorize the polyatomic ions, you’ll waste time
trying to figure out weird (and incorrect) covalent bonding arrangements, when what you’re
really dealing with is a straightforward ionic compound. Here they are in Table 25-1 (see

Liquid Water Is Denser than Ice
Kinetic molecular theory, which we cover in Chapter 10, predicts that adding heat to a collec-
tion of particles increases the volume occupied by those particles. Heat-induced changes in
volume are particularly evident at phase changes, so liquids tend to be less dense than their
solid counterparts. Weird water throws a wet monkey wrench into the works. Because of
H2O’s ideal hydrogen-bonding geometry, the lattice geometry of solid water (ice) is very
“open” with large empty spaces at the center of a hexagonal ring of water molecules. These
empty spaces lead to a lower density of solid water relative to liquid water. So, ice floats in
water. Although annoying, this watery exception is quite important for biology.
No Gas Is Truly Ideal
No matter what your misty-eyed grandparents tell you, there were never halcyon Days of 
Old when all the gases were ideal. To be perfectly frank, not a single gas is really, truly ideal.
Some gases just approach the ideal more closely than others. At very high pressures, even
gases that normally behave close to the ideal cease to follow the Ideal Gas Laws that we talk
about in Chapter 11.
When gases deviate from the ideal, we call them real gases. Real gases have properties that
are significantly shaped by the volumes of the gas particles and/or by interparticle forces. To
account for these nonideal factors, chemists use the van der Waals equation. Compared to
the Ideal Gas equation, PV = nRT, the following van der Waals equation includes two extra
variables, a and b. The variable a corrects for effects due to particle volume. The variable b
corrects for interparticle forces. The van der Waals equation is appropriate for gases at very
high pressure, low temperature conditions, and when gas particles have strong mutual
attraction or repulsion.

Common Names for Organic Compounds
Hearken Back to the Old Days
Serious study of chemistry predates modern systematic methods for naming compounds. As
a result, chemists persistently address a large number of common compounds, especially
organic compounds, by older, “trivial” names. This practice won’t change anytime soon. A
cynical take on the situation is to observe that progress occurs one funeral at a time. A less
cynical approach involves serenely accepting that which you cannot change, and getting
familiar with these old-fashioned names. Table 25-2 lists some important ones; head to
