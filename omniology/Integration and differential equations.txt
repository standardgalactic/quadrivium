Preface to these two texts
These two texts in this one cover, entitled ‘An introduction to the standard methods of elementary integration’ (Part I) 
and ‘The integration of ordinary differential equations’ (Part II), are two of the ‘Notebook’ series available as additional 
and background reading to students at Newcastle University (UK). This pair constitutes a basic introduction to both 
the elementary methods of integration, and also the application of some of these techniques to the solution of standard 
ordinary differential equations. Thus the first is a natural precursor to the second, but each could be read independently.
Each text is designed to be equivalent to a traditional text, or part of a text, which covers the relevant material, with many 
worked examples and some set exercises (for which the answers are provided). The necessary background is described in 
the preface to each Part, and there is a comprehensive index, covering the two parts, at the end.

List of Integrals
Preface
The material presented here is intended to provide an introduction to the methods for the integration of elementary 
functions. This topic is fundamental to many modules that contribute to a modern degree in mathematics and related 
studies – and especially those with a mathematical methods/applied/physics/engineering slant. The material has been 
written to provide a general introduction to the relevant ideas, and not as a text linked to a specific course of study that 
makes use of integration. Indeed, the intention is to present the material so that it can be used as an adjunct to a number 
of different modules or courses – or simply to help the reader gain a broader experience of, and an improved level of 
skill in, these important mathematical ideas. The aim is to go a little beyond the routine methods and techniques that 
are usually presented in conventional modules, but all the standard ideas are discussed (and can be accessed through the 
comprehensive index). This material should therefore prove a useful aid to those who want more practice, and also to 
those who would value a more complete and systematic presentation of the standard methods of integration.
It is assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of, and practical experience in, the methods of integration that are 
typically covered at A-level (or anything equivalent), although the presentation used here ensures that the newcomer 
should not be at a loss. It is, however, necessary that the reader has met the simplest ideas (and results) that underpin the 
differential calculus, and to have met partial fractions. This brief notebook does not attempt to include any applications 
of integration; this is properly left to a specific module that might be offered, most probably, in a conventional applied 
mathematics or engineering mathematics or physics programme. However, there is much to be gained by a more formal 
‘pure mathematical’ introduction to these ideas, and so we will touch on this at the start of Chapter 1. Some of the methods 
are employed in the integration of ordinary differential equations, which comprises Part II of this text.
The approach adopted here is to present some general ideas, which initially involve a notation, a definition, a theorem, 
etc., in order to provide a fairly firm foundation for the techniques that follow; but most particularly we present many 
carefully worked examples (there are 45 in total). Some exercises, with answers, are also offered as an aid to a better 
understanding of the methods.

Introduction and Background
1	 Introduction and Background
Being able to integrate functions is an essential skill for a mathematician (or engineer or physicist) who has an interest in, 
for example, mathematical methods and applications – or who just likes a challenge! Certainly many simple integration 
problems can be answered by a mathematical package (such as Maple), but even this – on occasion – fails if the function 
to be integrated has not been written in an appropriate form. (It also fails to integrate functions that, typically, involve 
an arbitrary power and require the construction of a recursion formula.) In addition, Maple will produce only one form 
of the answer, even when others are available (and we may prefer one rather than another, in a particular context). Here, 
we will devote much effort to a systematic development of the basic techniques of integration. However, we shall begin 
by laying appropriate foundations, which will include a brief description of the notion of integration and its connection 
with the differential calculus: the fundamental theorem of calculus. We will then use this theorem as the springboard for 
obtaining the basic rules of integration and for deriving, for example, the method of integration by parts. Of course, we 
shall include a careful discussion of both definite and indefinite integrals.
1.1	
The Riemann integral
We start with the familiar problem of finding the area under a (continuous and bounded) curve. Let the curve be y
f x
=
( )
, and suppose that the area required lies between x
a
=
 and x
b
=
 (b
a
>
) and between y = 0 and y
f x
=
( ) ; this 
is shown in the figure below
where, for convenience, we have drawn the case f x
( ) > 0 . (We will discuss the situation where f x
( ) < 0  a little later.) 
The area under the curve is estimated by rectangles (‘slices’, if you like) of width h1 , h2 , …, hN , and each of height 
f
f x
n
n
=
(
) , n
N
= 0 1, , ...,
, where x
xn
=
 is some value in (or on the boundary of) the rectangle of width hn . 
Furthermore, this height of the rectangle can be chosen to produce estimates of the area that are either above or below 
the actual area; an example of this is shown in the figure below, where the maximum and minimum values in a particular 
rectangle are easily identified:

This notation for the integral comes from the shape of the ‘s’ (for ‘sum’) used in the 17th century – the I symbol – and 
the width of the subdivision, originally '
'
δ x . Note that this definition used by Riemann has produced the definite integral. 
Before we proceed, it is instructive to see that this approach can be used to obtain the integral ‘directly’, without recourse 
to conventional integration.

Comment: If we wished, we could make this process more mathematically robust by showing that the limit (the area) 
does exist and so avoid the notion of ‘approximately equal to’. Thus we may write (see the figure above)

One immediate consequence of the Riemann definition is that if f x
( ) < 0 , we shall produce a negative value for f
h
×
 
– and so we have the notion of ‘negative area’. This, as we can readily see, is simply the result of computing an area when 
the curve y
f x
=
( )  drops below the x-axis; if we then wanted the ‘physical’ area, we would form −∑f x
h
n
(
)
 for 
every f xn
(
) < 0 . Of course, if some f xn
(
) > 0  and some f xn
(
) < 0 , we shall be adding positive and negative 
contributions, and some cancellation will inevitably occur. It is clear, therefore, that if we wanted the physical area 
between the curve and the x-axis, we must first identify the points where y
f x
=
( )  crosses the axis, and then compute 
the Riemann integral between each consecutive pair of zeros. The negative areas are then multiplied by −1 and added 
to the positive-valued contributions. 
We observe that another significant consequence of the Riemann definition is that we can permit the function,  
f x
( ) , to be discontinuous (provided that the area remains finite); thus we may allow the type of function represented 
in the figure below:

That this is possible, within the definition, is immediately apparent if we choose boundaries between particular subdivisions 
to coincide with x
a

b

here the equivalent interpretation of integrating up to x
a

Introduction and Background
Finally, we note that we may disconnect the definition of the Riemann integral from the concept of area. It is sufficient 
to be given y
f x
=
( ) , and a subdivision from x
a
=
 and x
b
=
 into widths h1 , h2 , …, with associated values x1
, x2 , … . Then we form the object

N

if this has a limit as hn →0 , n
N
= 1 2
, ,...,
 (so N →∞), then we write it as 
I [
[
D
E  G
I
.
It is clear that, at this stage, we have not introduced the concept of ‘integration’ in the calculus sense (as will probably be 
familiar from school mathematics), nor do we have the ‘indefinite integral’. All this hinges on the next important – indeed 
fundamental – idea that we must introduce.
Historical Note: The technique of putting upper and lower bounds on an area, and then using some limiting argument – or 
though it was never expressed like this – was known to the Greek mathematicians, in particular Eudoxus (408-355BC), and 
exploited with great success by Archimedes (287-212BC). (So Riemann’s definition amounts to a more precise statement of 
the ideas developed well over 2000 years earlier.) Methods for finding the area under a curve were rather well-developed 
by the time of Newton (1642-1727) and Leibniz (1646-1716), but these methods tended to be rather ad hoc, tailored to 
specific types of problem. The fundamental connection with the differential calculus (see below) was made – altogether 
independently – by Newton and Leibniz, although it was the latter who gave us the name ‘integral calculus’. He wanted 
to convey the idea of integrate in the sense of ‘bringing together’ or ‘combining’; that is, the summing (‘combining’) of the 
elements (‘slices’) that contribute to the total area. Hence Leibniz introduced the word integral to be the total area, and 
then the link with the differential calculus followed naturally – for Leibniz – to the name integral calculus.

Thus the function A X
(
)  – the integral of f X
(
)  – is that function whose derivative is f X
(
) : it is the ‘anti-derivative’ 
of f X
(
) . (Note that, in this context, the function must also satisfy A a
( ) = 0.) Hence the problem of finding

is one of reversing the process of differentiation: we have introduced the essential connection between the differential 
calculus and the fundamental notion of integration.
1.3 Primitives
Given any function f x
( ) , the construction of a function whose derivative is f x
( )  produces a primitive. So, for example, 
given f x
x
( ) =
2 , we have that 1

x  is a primitive, but so is 1

We assume that f x

of a primitive enables us to produce a list of common primitives, based on elementary differentiation. These, coupled 
with the various properties described in §1.4, enable a number of integration problems to be solved directly. Although 
this is useful, and it is an essential starting point, this barely represents what is generally regarded as the mathematical 
exercise (and challenge) that is ‘integration’. It is this latter aspect that will be the main thrust of Part I. Nevertheless, we 
should record the most common primitives that are met in elementary mathematics; these are provided in the list below.

The idea used in this example is often employed in order to find a representation of integrals (or the value of definite

The process of integration involves one further (minor) complication that we must address, although – as we shall see – 
this does lead to an important general comment about integration and the notion of the existence of integrals.
1.7	
Improper integrals
In all our previous considerations, we have assumed that the function to be integrated – the integrand – is bounded and, 
further, that the integration region (from a to b, say) is a finite domain. When either or both these requirements are not 
met, then we have an improper integral; we shall now examine these two possibilities.
We consider the definite integral

[

 G
I

 with primitive F x
( ) ;
let us suppose that a is fixed, but that b →∞. (We can equally consider b fixed and allow a →−∞, or even b →∞ 
and a →−∞, as simple extensions of the argument that we are about to present.) From the definition of a definite 
integral we have

 has a finite limit as b →∞, then the integral exists i.e. it is uniquely defined and finite. (It is ‘improper’

Non-uniqueness of representation
We finally comment on one other aspect of integration which, at first sight, may appear irritating but which is ultimately a 
powerful tool. We have seen that the process of integration is not unique in that we can produce any number of primitives, 
each differing from the other by additive constants. However, there often exists a non-uniqueness of representation i.e. 
different methods of integration may give results that appear different (and then, of course, in a particular context we may 
prefer one rather than another). A simple example appears in the table of elementary integrals (p. 15):

The integration of rational functions
2	 The integration of rational 
functions
It is quite common to encounter functions that are rational, that is, they take the form of (polynomial)/(polynomial). 
Indeed, a recognised and important skill in basic mathematics is knowing how to rewrite such functions so as to make 
the process of integration almost routine. The aim, in this chapter, is to develop a systematic approach to these problems, 
at least for a reasonable class of polynomials (and certainly the ones most often encountered). Let us first itemise the 
polynomials that we shall discuss.
We will investigate
I [
[
 G
I
ZLWK I [

4 [
 
 
 
 

where P x
( )  and Q x
( )  are polynomials. We allow P x
( )  to be a polynomial of any (finite) degree, but we shall restrict 
the choices for Q x
( )  (although what we present should make it possible to extend the ideas to more complicated Qs). 
(Remember that the degree of a polynomial is the highest power of x that appears.) The simplest Q x
( )  is x
a
+
, where 
a ≠0  is a constant; the case a = 0  produces a trivial problem. Note that the coefficient of x has been absorbed into 
P x
( ) . A simple extension of this choice for Q is Q x
x
a m
( )
(
)
=
+
 (m > 1, integer), which we shall also discuss. Then 
we consider Q x
x
bx
c
( ) =
+
+

 (where the constant c is not zero); this problem gives rise to three cases, depending 
on whether x

 has two distinct, real roots, a repeated root or a complex pair of roots. Finally, we shall 
examine in detail the choice 4 [

9, although we will take the opportunity to comment briefly 
on some of the obvious generalisations and extensions of all these.
2.1	
Improper fractions
The first stage in the simplification process is to reduce the rational function so that its fractional part is ‘proper’ i.e. the 
degree of the polynomial in the numerator is less than that in the denominator. This is accomplished by dividing – but 
note below how we accomplish this – Q x
( )  into P x
( ) . We start with 
P x

where n
m

 (which defines the fraction to be improper); the division then leaves, at worst, a fraction ( )
( )
P x
Q x  with 
( )
P x  a polynomial of degree m−1: this is a proper fraction. Once this has been completed, the integration can begin.

The integration of rational functions
2.3	
Quadratic denominator, Q(x)
This case is significantly more involved than the previous one, essentially because there are three variants (depending on 
the nature of the roots of Q x
( ) = 0) each leading to a different integration procedure. Let us be given

earlier. Thus we need to consider in detail only the term
px
q
x
bx
c

where p and q are constants. To proceed, we write

These two terms can be integrated, the first producing a logarithmic term and the second (after a substitution) is an arctan

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Comment: Some generalisations of these techniques are fairly straightforward. For example, a polynomial Q x
( )  that 
possesses any number of linear factors (including repeated factors), and any number of quadratic factors (but none 
repeated), can be integrated by applying the techniques just outlined. Here is an example of this approach, but one in 
which some of the quadratic factors cannot be further reduced to linear factors.

Integration and differential equations

The integration of rational functions
Finally, the appearance of repeated quadratic factors (which do not have real factors) poses a slightly more testing problem. 
Let us suppose that Q x
( )  contains a factor (
)
x
bx
c n
2
2
+
+
 (with c
b
−
>
2
0 ), for some integer n > 1, then an 
expansion in partial fractions, followed by division, will produce a new type of term:
px
q
x
bx
c n
+
+
+
(
)
2
2
.
It is immediately clear that, if we now write
px
q
p
x
b
q
pb
+
=
+
+
−
1
2
2
2

then the only term that requires any discussion is

E[

G .

Comment: The previous example is obviously somewhat involved, mainly because of the cumbersome coefficients (even 
though the coefficients in the original problem are quite simple – this is a typical complication in these problems). The main 
purpose of this example is to demonstrate that such integrals are susceptible to the methods that we have been describing.

This reduction formula is valid for any m and n (for which the integrals exist), but it is plainly a particularly useful 
identity if m and n are integers. In this case, and with n odd for m any integer, we have developed a powerful result, as 
the following example will demonstrate.

Rational functions of sin and cos
We complete this investigation of elementary integrals by examining the class of problems that arise from the integration 
of rational functions of sin and cos. All such integrals can be reduced to integrals of rational functions, and so all may 
be integrated by employing the methods described in Chapter 2. The transformation (substitution) that we adopt is an 
important one that holds a central position within the standard methods of integration: we use tangents of half angles.

, and the transformation 
that we propose introduces only rational terms (in t), we will necessarily produce a rational function of t to integrate. 
Note, however, that although this is a general method, which will demonstrate that all problems of this type can be 
reduced to one involving ‘standard’ integration methods, particular problems may be solved by a more direct route. We 
present two examples.

Preface
Preface
This text is intended to provide an introduction to the methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The 
material covered includes all the ideas that are discussed in any basic course at university, but excludes the methods of 
series solution. In addition, the presentation is intended to provide a general introduction to the relevant ideas, rather 
than as a text to be associated with any specific module or type of module. Indeed, the aim is to present the material in 
a way that enhances the understanding of the topic, and so can be used as an adjunct to a number of different modules 
– or simply to help the reader gain a broader experience. The plan is to go beyond the methods and techniques that are 
typically presented, but all the standard ideas are discussed here (and can be accessed through the comprehensive index).
It is assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of, and practical experience in, the differential and the integral calculus; 
that is, minimally, something equivalent to a good pass in A-level Pure Mathematics, provided that the corresponding 
skills are firmly in place. An understanding of the techniques of integration, as developed in Part I, will prove very useful. 
We do not attempt to include any applications of the differential equations (e.g. in physics or engineering); this is properly 
left to a specific course of study that might be offered in a conventional applied mathematics or engineering mathematics 
or physics programme.
The approach adopted here is to present some general ideas, which might involve a notation, or a definition, or a theorem, 
or a classification, but most particularly methods of solution, explained with a number of carefully worked examples (there 
are 34 in total). A small number of exercises, with answers, are also offered, for the interested reader.

What is a differential equation ?
1	 What is a differential equation ?
In this chapter we will briefly describe the nature of an ordinary differential equation (ODE), and what it means to solve 
it. Further, we will also mention the different types of solution that may arise. The classification of ODEs will be given, 
and with it an overview of the various types of equation that we will study in this notebook.
1.1	
The nature and solution of differential equations
A differential equation is a relation, but more usually an algebraic equation, connecting a function, y x
( ),  and one or 
more derivatives of y. Thus relations (equations) such as
f x y y
( , ,
)′ = 0 , for example: ′ +
−
=
y
xy
x
2
0,
or f x y y y
( , ,

)
,
′
′′ = 0  for example: xy
x y
y
x
′′ +

′ +
−
=
(
)
,

where the prime denotes the derivative e.g. d
d
y
x
y
≡
′, are differential equations. Any function, y x
( ),  which satisfies the 
equation is a solution, and any solution which contains as many independent, arbitrary constants as the highest derivative 
in the equation is the general solution. Thus the first example above will have a general solution which contains one 
arbitrary constant, and the second will have two. (Important and special, exceptional solutions – singular solutions – will 
be mentioned later.)
In the final analysis, any function – which may be defined via a relation – which has been proposed as a solution exists 
where it is defined, provided that it also satisfies the original differential equation. By ‘defined’ we mean that the function 
is to remain bounded and, in the context that we describe here, also to remain real. That the function is a solution is 
simply confirmed by direct substitution; if there is any doubt on this score, a suitable check should be performed. Indeed, 
because some equations may possess exceptional solutions, this – often routine – calculation becomes a necessary exercise 
in special cases.
1.2	
Classification of ODEs 
Ordinary differential equations are classified according to the highest derivative that appears in the equation, how this 
derivative appears and how the other terms in the equation appear. Often the correct identification of the classification 
(and then of the type, as we describe later) provides the first step in finding a solution of the equation. Let us first give 
the relevant definitions.
The order of the equation is the highest derivative in the equation (and so this will also specify the number of independent 
arbitrary constants that must appear in the general solution). The degree of the equation is the highest power (i.e. degree) 
of the highest derivative in the equation (after all the derivative terms have been rationalised e.g.

We see that the operator L on y does not itself contain y, although it may contain x explicitly (in the coefficients). 
Here are a few examples that should help to explain this classification.

Finally, we may also, for a linear ODE – and this applies only to linear equations – describe the functions that contribute 
to the general solution; this important idea is one which, as we shall see later, helps us to seek solutions. Consider the 
linear ODE
L y
g x

We choose

where yII  is any function which satisfies the original equation; yI  is the most general solution of the homogeneous 
equation i.e. the one without a forcing term. (The formal definition of homogeneity will be given later; see §2.2.) It is 
usual to call yI  the complementary function or simply CF (and then we often write this solution as yCF ); the solution 
yII  is a particular integral or PI (and then, correspondingly, we write yPI ). The complete general solution is therefore

We also consider the equations that are, or may be written as, exact differentials; finally the special cases of  
f x y y
( , ,
)′ = 0 , with either x or y absent, will be analysed.
In Chapter 4 we consider second-order, linear ODEs, and in particular those with constant coefficients, such as
′′ +

and those of Euler type e.g.

= .
We will also include the method of variation of parameters, and its simpler variant that allows for the reduction of the 
order of the equation. This latter method is particularly useful when we need to find a second solution of the equation 
or a particular integral (PI); methods for finding some PIs directly will also be developed.
Finally, in Chapter 5, we look at three ideas that play a rôle in any deeper study of ODEs. First, the manoeuvre of 
interchanging x and y, so that we treat the solution as x(y) rather than y(x); secondly, the occurrence of singular solutions 
and how to find them; thirdly, we conclude with a few comments on uniqueness, and invoke this property to generate 
two familiar trigonometric identities.

First order ODEs: standard results
2	 First order ODEs: standard results
We present the three standard and most common types of equation, and associated methods of solution, that are taught 
in introductory courses on ODEs. In each case we describe the underlying technique that is involved and present three 
worked examples; a few exercises are offered at the end of the chapter.
2.1	
Separable equations
The simplest of all types of first order ODEs – because the problem immediately reduces to direct integration – takes the 
form
′ =
y
f x g y
( ) ( );
the expression on the right is a product of a function of x and a function of y. (This is what is meant by ‘separable’.) Note 
that this form is equivalent, for suitable f and g, to

The process of integration will generate one arbitrary constant – not two, because each integration produces an additive 
arbitrary constant which can be combined into a single one. Any exceptional solutions, if they exist, that are associated 
with division by zero (here g y
( ) = 0) can be investigated separately (and, more often than not, they pose no difficulties).

 so it is of degree 1.
[This same basic notion of homogeneity can be used to describe linear ODEs. Consider the linear, second order ODE
a x y
b x y
c x y
g x
( )
( )
( )
( ),
′′ +
′ +
=
where the dependence on x is altogether immaterial. The equation with g x
( ) ≡0  is homogeneous of degree 1 in y; to 
see this, write ky for y to give
a x ky
b x ky
c x ky

i.e. 	
k a x y

(and then we recover a x y
b x y

′′ +

= 0  since k ≠0).
Thus the equation with no forcing term (i.e. zero right-hand side) is usually referred to as the homogeneous equation; note 
that this argument clearly fails if there is a right-hand side, independent of y, because then k cannot be factored out.]
We now return to the first-order ODE of homogeneous type:
′ =

f x y

f x y

which clearly requires that the form of f is

the left-hand side can be written as the derivative of a simple term – the product of y x

left-hand side has been converted into an exact differential. The function that makes this possible – the exponential here

although it is far from good practice to remember, quote and substitute into this formula. This construct does, however, 
demonstrate that all linear, first-order equations can be solved. (This general form of solution is accepted as the solution, 
even if the integrals cannot be expressed in terms of known functions; written like this, the solution is said to have been 
reduced to a quadrature, implying that a numerical method would need to be employed, in general, to take it any further.)

First order ODEs: special equations
3	 First order ODEs: special equations
We now turn to a consideration of some types of equation that do not fall into the categories discussed in Chapter 2 but 
which, nevertheless, can be solved.
3.1	
The Bernoulli equation
This equation is the simplest that we consider in this chapter: it can be transformed into the standard linear form (§2.3). 
The most general form of the equation is
′ +
=
y
p x y
q x yn
( )
( )
where n is any constant (although we exclude n = 0  and n = 1 because, in these two cases, the equation is immediately 
a version of the linear equation). To see how we should proceed, we divide throughout by yn:
y
y
p x y
q x
n
n
−
−
′ +
=
( )
( )
1
 ( y ≠0)
and we observe that the derivative of y
n
1−,  with respect to x, is (
)
1−
′
−
n y
y
n
 which is essentially the first term in the 
equation. This suggests that we introduce u x
y
n
( ) =
−
1
, so that ′ =
−
′
−
u
n y
y
n
(
)
,
1
 and hence the equation becomes
1
1−
′ +
=
n u
p x u
q x
( )
( )
which is linear in u x
( ), and so we may use the technique described in §2.3.
Example 10
Find the general solution of the equation ′ −

y
xy

We introduce u
y

where α  is any function of ′y . The method we adopt, in an effort to simplify the problem, is to differentiate the equation

This is a linear, second-order ODE (with variable coefficients). The methods for solving this type of equation are well-
known, even if it is necessary to seek a solution as an appropriate power series in some cases (e.g. via the method of 
Frobenius). Of course, in simple cases it may be possible to integrate in terms of elementary functions. The solution of

Second order ODEs
4	 Second order ODEs
In this chapter we present methods for solving two standard types of linear, second order ODEs. (However, we do not 
describe the construction of power-series solutions, using the method of Frobenius.) In addition, we will describe some 
techniques that are applicable if further information is available (e.g. one solution is known), or the equation takes a special 
form (e.g. y is absent). Finally, we mention some methods for finding particular integrals of linear equations.
4.1	
Constant coefficient equations
We consider the linear equation
ay
by
cy
g x
′′ +
′ +
=
( )
where a, b and c are given constants. We have already demonstrated (§1.2) that a linear equation possesses a solution 
which comprises a complementary function ( yCF ) and a particular integral ( yPI ); here we concentrate on yCF  (which 
is the general solution of the equation with g ≡0 ). In order to develop a general method of solution, we first identify 
the roots of the quadratic equation

let us label these λ1 and λ2,  and we assume that these are real and distinct. (The other two cases will follow shortly.)

(It is easily confirmed, by direct substitution, that this is indeed a solution of the original equation, for arbitrary real 
constants C and D. This answers any questions about the validity of working with complex constants and, apparently, a 
complex-valued solution: in the final analysis, a real, general solution has been constructed.)

Second order ODEs
The procedure that is typically adopted, in order to find yCF  for the constant coefficient equation, is to seek a solution 
y
x
= eλ  (for general x). This gives the quadratic equation for λ,  and from its solution we are then able to write down 
the appropriate general solution by following the ‘recipe’ described above.

Comment: This same technique is applicable to constant coefficient, linear ODEs of any order e.g.

simply by seeking a solution y

then constructed by following the methods above, and in particular by forming a general, linear combination of all the 
possible solutions.

series). Now we seek a solution of the original equation in the form y

(This is a version of the ‘variation of parameters’ – see §4.4 – because the arbitrary constant in Au x
( )  is treated as a 
function: the parameter is allowed to vary.) The resulting equation is a general, first-order equation in ′v  (§2.3) and so the 
method of solution proceeds as if the order of the equation has been reduced. Note that, in addition to this simplification, 
the method will also provide the complete solution in that it will produce the appropriate PI that is generated by g x
( ). 
It is not normal practice to continue the formulation of the general solution for v x
( ),  and then for y x
( );  rather, the 
technique is simply to identify a solution, u x
( ), and follow the procedure indicated above.

Variation of parameters
Here, we expand on the idea developed in the previous section by supposing that we have available both solutions (of 
a second order, linear ODE) that comprise the CF. (This same method is applicable to any linear, nth order ODE, when 
the CF is completely known.) Consider
a x y

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Finding particular integrals directly

we can always find the PI by using one form (§4.3) or another (§4.4) of the method of variation of parameters. However, 
if g x
( )  takes a simple form – especially in the case of constant-coefficient equations – then it is possible to find the 
PI directly by, essentially, algebraic means. We will briefly present systematic approaches in three simple situations (but 
obvious extensions of these can also be tackled using these techniques). Of course, it is always possible, when seeking PIs, 
to make an appropriate guess and confirm its correctness, but we opt for something more methodical here.
(a) g(x) is a polynomial
In this case, we differentiate the original equation as many times as is necessary to reduce g x
( )  to a non-zero constant. 
A form of the PI then follows by solving the equations, starting from the simplest solution – usually a suitable constant 
– of the final equation.

More general aspects of ODEs
5	 More general aspects of ODEs
In this final chapter, we touch on three rather more general ideas that those who seek some deeper ideas may find 
informative. We will extend, a little, the idea that we met in §3.2 and §3.5, where the roles of x and y are interchanged. 
Then we will highlight the important fact that some equations admit exceptional solutions – and we have already met a few 
– but now we put this possibility within a systematic framework of solutions. We conclude by making some observations 
about the nature of uniqueness proofs; with uniqueness available, we can obtain (as examples) two important identities 
between the trigonometric functions.
5.1	
Interchanging x and y

This equation is of order 1 and degree 1 but, in general, it is nonlinear – maybe highly so, and cannot be integrated (in 
the general case) by any of our methods, as it stands. However, if we elect to treat x

we may write

5.2	
Singular solutions
In this section we comment on a special solution which may, exceptionally, be the relevant solution to our first order ODE. 
Some of the early examples (in Chapters 2 and 3) described differential equations that had special solutions that had to be 
checked against the general solution, once it had been obtained. In all but two cases, these solutions, it transpired, could 
be recovered by taking special values (or limits) of the arbitrary constant; thus, eventually, they were not exceptional at 
all. However, in Example 5 (§2.2) and Example 11 (§3.2), we found exceptional solutions that could never be recovered 
from the general solution. Any solution of the differential equation which cannot be obtained from the general solution 
is called a singular solution. It turns out that a singular solution is intimately associated with the general solution: it is 
the envelope of the general solution, mapped out as the arbitrary constant varies. We will explain how this comes about.
Let f x y A
( , ,
) = 0 be the general solution of a first order ODE, where A is the arbitrary constant. Now a singular solution 
has the same slope as the general solution, at the same point, because this is what the ODE implies. In addition, it also 
coincides – at some point – with consecutive curves of the general solution, generated as A varies from A1 to A2  (say), 
but in the limit as A
A

→
. This is the definition of an envelope of a family of curves; it requires that f x y A
( , ,
) = 0 
has a double root in A i.e. ∂
∂
=
f
A
0 . The envelope (if one exists) is therefore the solution(s) obtained by eliminating A 
between

Comment: Any singular solution of the differential equation can be determined directly from the equation simply by 
selecting the condition that ′y  has a repeated root (since, as we have seen, at least two solutions exist with the same slope, 
at some point). In Example 11: x y

More general aspects of ODEs
Comment: We can readily see that solutions of linear equations can never generate envelope solutions, and so singular 
solutions of these equations do not exist. Consider the solution of some linear equation; it will take the general form
y x
A
x
x
( )
( )
( )
=
+
α
β
for some functions α  and β,  where A is the arbitrary constant. Thus we have, for any envelope curve,
f x y A
y

x
x
( , ,

( )
≡
−
−

α
β
0  and so ∂
∂
= −
=
f
A
x
α( )
0
which gives y x
x
( )
( )
= β
, which is the general solution with A = 0: there is no exceptional ‘envelope’ solution. Of 
course, we could have simply noted that a solution which is linear in A (or, equivalently, a differential equation linear in 
′y ) cannot have a repeated root for y′.
5.3	
Uniqueness 
We have seen, in §5.2, that some ODEs have more than one solution through certain points in the (x,y)-plane. This 
observation prompts us to consider the general issue of uniqueness; perhaps solutions of ODEs suffer from non-uniqueness, 
in a more general sense. (The question of existence is not one that we will pursue here – we have, after all, derived solutions 
of many equations – but this may be a critical issue if solutions cannot be constructed by any method. In this situation, 
a numerical solution may be considered, but this would be a wasteful exercise if we do not have some conviction that a 
suitable solution exists.) We will, in all that follows, consider only first order ODEs.
Most uniqueness theorems assume, first, that the ODE can be expressed as ′ =
y
f x y
( , )  and, secondly, that f satisfies 
a Lipschitz condition in y:
f x y
f x y
k y
y
( ,
)
( ,
)

2
−
≤
−
,
where k is a (positive) constant, for all functions which may be solutions. We now consider the ODE with the boundary 
condition y a
b
( )
;
=
 let us suppose that there are two solutions, y
x
1( )  and y
x
2( ),  that satisfy both the ODE and the 
given boundary condition. We form
′ −′ =
−
y
y
f x y
f x y

and then apply the Lipschitz condition (which, of course, we assume applies here), to give

where A and B are arbitrary constants; but w = 0  on x
a

i.e. w ≡0 . The solution of the ODE is unique.
In particular cases, we can often use this argument directly, without recourse to the introduction of a general Lipschitz 
condition.

so A = 0: w ≡0  i.e. the solution that exists is unique.
We conclude by invoking uniqueness when we solve our final pair of ODEs; in each, we solve in two different ways and 
set the two representations of the solution equal.
