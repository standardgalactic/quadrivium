Introduction
C
ongratulations! Brilliant person that you are, you use Paint Shop Pro!
Thousands of other brilliant people also use Paint Shop Pro, and for one
intelligent reason: It does darned near anything you could want it to do, from
fixing photographs to animating Web graphics, and — unlike certain more
famous programs — it doesn’t set you back a week’s salary.
Guided by that same intelligence, you’re probably asking yourself, “Is a book
available that gives me what I want, quickly, without dragging me through a
tutorial? One with an attractive yellow-and-black cover so that it doesn’t get
lost in the clutter on my desk? Preferably cheap?”
Welcome to Paint Shop Pro 8 For Dummies, the attractive, inexpensive,
yellow-and-black book that lets you get great graphics out of Paint Shop Pro
without making you feel like you’re going back to school in an attractive,
yellow-and-black school bus.
What Can You Do with This Book?
Books are useful, elevating things. Many people use them to elevate their PC
monitors, for example. With that fate in mind, this book has been created to
serve an even higher purpose: to enable you to do the kind of graphics stuff
you really want to do. Here’s a smattering of what you can do with the help of
this book:
 Download photos from a digital camera.
 Fix up fuzzy, poorly exposed, or icky-colored photos.
 Print album pages or other collections of photos.
 Paint, draw, or letter-in all kinds of colors, patterns, and textures.
 Draw using lines and shapes that you can go back and change later.
 Apply cool special effects to photos and drawings.

Is This the Book for You?
Is this the Paint Shop Pro book for you? It depends. If, like us, you tend to
leave chocolate fingerprints from your bookstore biscotti on the books you’re
browsing, it’s definitely yours now.
In addition, this book is for you if
 You find most computer books boring or useless
 You need solutions rather than lessons
 You find parts of Paint Shop Pro 8 confusing
 You haven’t ever done much with graphics programs
 You have used other Windows programs
 You need Paint Shop Pro for business or home use
 You really like bulleted lists
How Is This Book Organized?
Computer software “manuals” document features because that’s the easiest
way to write one: “The File menu presents the following choices. . . .” If features
on the File menu exactly matched what you had in mind, that would be great —
but how are you to know to use the Clone Brush tool when what you’re really
looking for is the “Fix Uncle Dave’s hair transplant scars” tool?
Some computer books are organized into lessons, teaching you how features
work. They give you examples of basic tasks and then more complicated
ones. Along the way — before too long, you hope — you find an example
resembling what you had in mind.
This book is organized by different kinds of tasks, like working with photos
or painting pictures or adding text. Wherever possible, the book tells you
exactly what to do in numbered steps. Where that’s not possible, it explains
how things work in nontechnical language.

You don’t have to read the book in any order. Just skip to the section or chap-
ter you need. Go right to the index, if you want — or the Rich Tennant car-
toons! In detail, this book is organized as described in this section.
Part I: Getting the Picture
This part puts you in the picture and puts your picture in Paint Shop Pro.
Chapter 1 puts you in the picture, explaining how to get control over all the
various doo-dahs floating around the Paint Shop Pro screen. The chapter also
gives quick synopses of what the various tools do, which is particularly useful
for anyone who needs just a few hints to get going — and it tells you how to
open an image file, create a new image, or save an image as various file types.
Chapter 2 tells you how to get existing images into Paint Shop Pro, whether it’s
from a scanner, a digital camera, or a PC screen. This chapter also gives you
hints on how to do something your relatives will love: Squeeze files so that
they download quickly.
Part II: Painting the Picture
Part II is for anyone who plans to paint, draw, or otherwise doodle in Paint
Shop Pro. Chapter 3 addresses the new Paint Shop Pro Materials box, showing
you how to not only get the color you want but also paint in the wild gradi-
ents, patterns, and textures that Paint Shop Pro 8 offers. Chapter 4 tells you
how to use the basic Paint Shop Pro painting tools and also how to control the
way the Paint Shop Pro paint tools work: brush size, spray patterns, brush
shapes, paint density, and more. Chapter 5 shows you how to do something
you have seen only in cartoons: Make images flow right off a paint brush. We
explain two features that are useful for retouching: the Paint Shop Pro Picture
Tubes tool (a kind of spreadable clip art) and the Clone Brush tool.
Part III: Improving Appearances
When you have an image that needs some sprucing up, Part III is the place to
turn. Chapter 6 shows you how to use the Paint Shop Pro hand tools to brush
away wrinkles from portraits, fix scratches, and remove red eye. Chapter 7
gives you nearly instant ways to correct overall photo problems, such as bad
exposure, poor color, or blurry, speckly, and dim grayish images. In addition,
we discuss the fabulous One-Step Photo Fix! Chapter 8 takes you to fun and
exotic lands of artistic effects, where you can twist, make three-dimensional
buttons, do cutouts, or make an image look like it was done in neon or bur-
nished copper! Chapter 9 helps you cope with the inescapable reality that,
yes, you really are using a computer, and if you want the most from Paint
3
Introduction

Shop Pro, you need to understand just a little about how it deals with color.
Chapter 10 shows you how to fine-tune the quality of an image for contrast,
brightness, and color and tackle the more subtle problems of certain photos.
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content
Part IV opens the door to a brave (and fun) new world: changing the content
of an image. Chapter 11 shows you how to change the size, proportion, orien-
tation, and rotation of an image. (Straightening an image, however, is covered
in Chapter 2, with the scanning information.) This chapter also shows you
how to crop an image to get the composition you want or flip the image into
a mirror image. Chapter 12 gives you one of the key tricks for changing con-
tent: selecting parts of an image. Because Paint Shop Pro has no idea where
cousin Suzie begins and her husband ends, it’s up to you to tell Paint Shop
Pro “Suzie’s the one in white” or to outline her by hand, when you want to
abstract her into a solo portrait. Chapter 13 shows you ways to move, copy,
or reshape the parts you select. Need a flock of jumping sheep when you
have only a few? Clone your sheep like Dolly! Chapter 14 shows you how to
divide images into layers or use layers to combine images. Layers are power-
ful tools that make later editing much easier and produce stunning image
overlays. Chapter 15 lets you add layers of easily edited text and shapes to
an image, using the Paint Shop Pro 8 expanded vector graphics tools.
Part V: Taking It to the Street
All this fooling around in Paint Shop Pro is great, but in the end you probably
want an image to appear somewhere else: on a piece of paper, on the Web, or
as part of an animation. Chapter 16 shows you how to best fit an image on
paper. It also tells you how to print multi-image pages for photo albums, col-
lages, or portfolios. Chapter 17 tells you how to get exactly the image file
you want for the Web and gives you tips for getting the fastest-downloading
images with the least sacrifice in quality. Lastly, when you have found how to
do what you want in Paint Shop Pro, Chapter 18 shows you two new tricks
that Paint Shop Pro 8 has put in, scripting and presets, that save you oodles
of time in the long run.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Problems often come in threes, so this book tackles them by the tens, just
to be sure. Part VI has fixes for the ten most-wanted issues that people run
into when they’re trying to use Paint Shop Pro. Chapter 19 untangles the ten
most common confusions and perplexing problems of Paint Shop Pro, and
Chapter 20 gives you ten quick fixes for photography problems.

This method saves time, saves trees, and keeps you from falling asleep. (The
underlined letters you see in numbered steps are the same ones you find in
all Windows programs. They indicate that if the mouse breaks, you can press
the Alt key on the keyboard along with the underlined letter’s key to get the
same result as though you had clicked the word with the mouse.)

Part I
Getting the Picture

In this part . . .
N
eed to get in the picture quickly? Do you need to get
a picture quickly into or out of Paint Shop Pro? Start
here.
The Paint Shop Pro screen has more controls, tools, and
objects ﬂoating around in it than the space shuttle has. In
Chapter 1, we (brieﬂy) summarize what all this stuff does,
help you bring the various ﬂoating windows under your
control, and show you how to use fundamental features,
like the command history and undo/redo features. If you
already have some experience with graphics programs,
read Chapter 1 for a fast way to discover the unique Paint
Shop Pro quirks and features.
Throughout the rest of Part I, we’ll show you how to get
pictures into and out of Paint Shop Pro. Do you already
have an image ﬁle on your PC? We give you in Chapter 1
different ways to open or create image ﬁles. For instance,
Paint Shop Pro provides a helpful image browser that lets
you see tiny, thumbnail images of various ﬁles before you
open them. We’ll also tell you how to make the various
choices involved in creating a new image, such as size,
resolution, and number of colors. We’ll point out also the
pros and cons of saving images as different types of ﬁles.
If you’re downloading an image from a digital camera,
scanning an image from paper, or capturing it from your
PC screen, turn to Chapter 2 for help. Discover the best
ways to scan printed images, the two different ways to get
images from cameras, or the various ways Paint Shop Pro
lets you grab the exact object you want from a computer
screen. Also, Chapter 2 discusses the amazing Paint Shop
Pro Straightening tool, which can help set a crooked
image right.

mages, like documents, music, or any other lump of stuff you work with
on a computer, are usually stored somewhere as files. After you have an
image as a file on a CD, your PC, or your computer network, Paint Shop Pro
can probably open it. If the image is on a camera, you may need to download
it to your PC first — see Chapter 2.
Images, like children, are easy to deal with in small quantities and variety —
but in large quantity and variety, they’re challenging to manage. Paint Shop
Pro gives you lots of tricks for keeping an eye on all your graphical progeny,
from browsing and previewing them to zooming in or out or saving them as a
different type of file.
Image files come in an amazing variety of different file types because various
software geeks over the years have decided that they know a much better
way of storing an image on a computer — a file type — than the last geek.
Image files of different types have different multi-letter extensions at the end,
like .jpg, .png, or .tif. People refer to them by those extensions, saying “jay-
peg” or “jay pee jee” for .jpg or “a ping file” for .png. These file types some-
times behave differently in Paint Shop Pro, so see the section “Using native

and foreign file types,” later in this chapter, if someone gives you a file that
behaves oddly. Fortunately, although you need to be aware that images come
in a variety of file types, most of the time you don’t have to give a hoot. Paint
Shop Pro can crack open most popular types of image file.
Opening Image Files
Paint Shop Pro gives you three ways to open a file:
 Browsing (“I’ll know it when I see it”): Choose File➪Browse or press
Ctrl+B. The browser window opens, as shown in the following section, in
Figure 1-1. You open folders in the left panel, and double-click tiny pic-
tures in the right panel to open them.
 Opening (“I know its name and where it lives”): Choose File➪Open; or,
click the Open button on the Tool Bar, or press Ctrl+O. The Open dialog
box appears, as shown a couple of sections from here, in Figure 1-2.
 Double-clicking (“There it is — open it”): If you see a file listed and it
displays a Paint Shop Pro icon (a tiny, artist’s palette), double-click that
puppy and Paint Shop Pro should start up and display the image.
That’s all you need to know — well, at least most of the time, that’s all. The
following sections give you some additional tricks and tips for opening files in
those three ways.
If you can see the image, but aren’t sure where the image file is, see Chapter 2.
Images that appear in some document (a Web page, a Microsoft Word docu-
ment, an Adobe Acrobat document) may not be stored as a file on your com-
puter. (Or, if they are, they may be very hard to find.) You may need to capture
the image off your screen.
For some files, Paint Shop Pro has to translate the image file into a form it can
use. Translation may especially be necessary for vector image files, such as
DXF and WPG. To translate, Paint Shop Pro needs additional information from
you: specifically, how many pixels wide and high you want the image to be.
See the section “Using Vector File Types (Drawing Files),” later in this chapter
for more information.
Nifty browser tricks for opening 
and managing files
We like the browser best for opening files because it also lets you manage
them visually. Do one of the following to open the browser:
10
Part I: Getting the Picture 

 Press Ctrl+B.
 Click the Browse icon, as shown in the margin.
 Choose File➪Browse.
 If the Open dialog box is open already, click the Browse button.
Figure 1-1 shows the Browse window, with the sort of images you see next.
(Paint Shop Pro may take a few seconds to display all the images.) To close
the window when you’re done, choose File➪Close or press Ctrl+F4.
The left side of the Browse window looks and works like Windows Explorer.
Click a folder to see its contents (thumbnail images of the graphics files in
that folder). If the folder contains more folders, a + sign appears to its left. To
open that folder, click the + sign; to close it, click the – sign that now appears
where the + sign did.
On the right side of the window are the thumbnail images with their file-
names. Here are some ways to make good use of your thumbnails:
 To open an image file: Double-click the image.
 To check image type, size, and date: Pause your cursor over any
thumbnail. Paint Shop Pro displays the information near your cursor.
For more detail, right-click the thumbnail and choose Information from
the menu that appears.
 To manually rearrange thumbnails: Drag them where you want them.
 To move an image to a different folder: Drag the thumbnail from the
right pane to your destination folder in the left pane.
 To copy a file to a different folder: Drag the thumbnail to another
folder while holding the Ctrl key down.
 To create a new folder: In the left panel, click the folder in which you
want to create a new folder. Choose File➪Create New Folder, and in the
Create New Folder dialog box that appears, type your new folder’s name.

Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, and Saving Image Files

 To delete a file: Right-click its thumbnail and choose Delete from the
menu that appears.
 To rename a file: Right-click its thumbnail, choose Rename from the
drop-down menu, and enter a new name in the Rename File dialog box
that appears.
 To select several files for opening, moving, copying, or deleting: Hold
down the Ctrl key and click their thumbnail images. To select a series,
left-click the first (or last) image; then hold down the Shift key and click
the last (or first) image. Follow the instructions in the preceding bullets
for opening, moving, copying, or deleting files.
To sort your thumbnails in different ways, follow these steps:
1. Right-click the blank area to the right of the pictures and choose Sort
from the context menu that appears.
The Thumbnail Sort dialog box appears.
2. Choose Ascending or Descending sort order from the Primary 
Sort tab.
3. Choose what to sort by in the Sort Conditions area: file attributes,
such as date, or image attributes, such as dimensions (size).
4. To sort within a sort (such as by filename within each file date), click
the Secondary Sort tab and again choose a sort order and what to
sort by.
5. Click OK to sort.
Helpful hints for opening files
by name and location
If you think that you know the name of your file and the disk and folder where
it lives, you can choose the fastest route to opening the file. Choose the familiar
old File➪Open command (every program has one) or press Ctrl+O or click the
File Open button on the toolbar (as shown in the margin of this paragraph).
Paint Shop Pro adds a few special features for working with images, however.
Figure 1-2 shows the Open dialog box that appears.
Double-click an image file in the Open dialog box and Paint Shop Pro tries to
load it. Often, however, you find that you’re poring over a big pile of files with
similar names. Here are a few tricks to help you find the one you want:
12
Part I: Getting the Picture 

 To make sure that you’re opening the right file: Click to enable the
Show Preview check box. Then click any file, and a preview appears in
the Preview window, as shown in Figure 1-2. The Preview feature may
slow you down. The computer takes a little extra time to display a pic-
ture, so you may want to disable the check box if you have big pictures
and don’t really need previews.
 To switch to the browser: Click the Browse button.
 To open more than one file at a time: Hold down the Ctrl button while
clicking filenames, and then click the Open button. Or, to open a bunch
of image files listed sequentially in the Open dialog box, click the first
file, hold down the Shift button, click the last file, and then click the
Open button.
 To open a commonly used or favorite folder: Click the Favorites
button. That’s the rightmost button (refer to Figure 1-2) on the dialog
box toolbar. From the drop-down list that appears, choose the My
Pictures folder, the My PSP8 Pictures folder (in My Documents on your
hard drive), or the Paint Shop Pro 8 folder (in My Programs on your hard
drive.) You can add a folder to the list. Just open that folder in the Open
dialog box, click the Favorites button, and choose Add Current from the
drop-down menu. To remove a folder, choose Remove and then choose
the folder from the list that drops down.
 To trim down the list of files to show just one type (if you’re looking for
a GIF file, for example): Click the Files of Type selection box and choose
that type from the many file types Paint Shop Pro can read.

favorite

13
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, and Saving Image Files

If the file you want isn’t listed, make sure that the wrong file type isn’t
chosen in the Files of Type selection box. File type choices are “sticky,”
in that if you previously chose to display only GIF files, the next time you
use the Open dialog box it displays only GIF files. If you’re looking for a
JPG file now, you don’t see it! Choose All Files under Files of Type to see
all files again.
 To see information on image width, height, and color depth: Read the
Image Information area after you click your file.
 To see more information about an image you have clicked, such as
date or file size: Click the Details button.
Secrets of opening a file 
by double-clicking
If you see an image file listed on your computer — in a My Computer or
Windows Explorer window, for example — and it displays the Paint Shop Pro
palette icon, you can open it in Paint Shop Pro by double-clicking that icon. If
you have several images you want to open, double-click each of them sepa-
rately, and they all get a separate window in Paint Shop Pro. You don’t end up
with multiple copies of Paint Shop Pro running.
If you have an image file that Paint Shop Pro doesn’t open when you double-
click it, three things could be responsible:
 The file doesn’t have an extension, like .jpg or .gif. This problem often
happens when someone sends you a file from a Macintosh computer.
Use the browsing or File➪Open technique described in the preceding
sections.
 Paint Shop Pro can’t open the file. Paint Shop Pro can open many differ-
ent types of files, but not all of them.
 Paint Shop Pro may not be configured to open that file type. See the
nearby sidebar, “Making Paint Shop Pro open the right file types when
you double-click.”
Viewing and Zooming an Image
Working with images on a PC involves a great deal of zooming — changing the
magnification of your view. Sometimes you need to work close up, taking that
nasty gleam out of Uncle Charley’s eye, for example (something Aunt Mabel
has been trying to do for years). Other times, you really need to see the whole
picture, but Uncle Charley’s gleaming eye rather scarily fills the whole window.
14
Part I: Getting the Picture 

Zooming doesn’t change the size of an image (in pixels or in inches). It only
changes how big Paint Shop Pro displays the image onscreen.
Zooming an image in the window
The basic way to zoom in (enlarge the view) or zoom out (see the big picture)
is to use the Zoom tool. Click the tiny down arrow on the top button on the
Tools toolbar, as shown in the margin of this paragraph. Buttons in Paint
Shop Pro 8 are what we call “tool groups” from which you choose a tool.
15
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, and Saving Image Files
Making Paint Shop Pro open the right file types
when you double-click
Two problems can occur with double-clicking
as a way of opening image files:
 Paint Shop Pro may open files that you
would prefer to be opened by some other
program. For example, if you’re running
AutoCAD or another AutoDesk program,
you may prefer that the AutoDesk program
open DXF files because they’re one of
AutoDesk’s own file types.
 Paint Shop Pro may fail to open image files
that you want it to open. For example, you
may install new software for a new digital
camera, and, suddenly, when you double-
click JPG files, some program other than
Paint Shop Pro opens the file.
These problems usually occur when you have
more than one graphics program. The latest one
installed may grab all the file types for itself.
Both problems can be solved the same way.
Follow these steps to determine which files are
opened (or not) by Paint Shop Pro:
1. Chose File➪Preferences➪File Format
Associations.
The File Format Associations dialog box
appears. This box directs Windows to open
certain file types using Paint Shop Pro.
2. Click the check boxes to enable or disable
the file types you want opened by Paint
Shop Pro.
To disable all check boxes, click Remove
All. To enable all check boxes, click Select
All. (After that, you can enable or disable
check boxes manually, if you like.) To have
Paint Shop Pro open only the file types that
aren’t opened by any other program, click
Select Unused.
3. Click OK.
At this point, Paint Shop Pro is properly set up
to open just the file types you want it to and
leave the others alone. The other program you
use, however, may still not be properly set up to
open the files you want it to open. We can’t give
you much help with that, but we can tell you one
place to get help: Choose Start➪Help from your
Windows taskbar. In the Help window that
appears, click the Index tab and then, in the text
box at the top left of the window, type File
extensions. Below that text box appears a line
reading “Associating with programs.” Double-
click that to get help with associating file exten-
sions with your other program.

Here, you get a choice of the Pan tool (the arrow) or the Zoom tool (the mag-
nifying glass). Click the Zoom tool. Your cursor changes to a magnifying glass
icon. Then click with it on the image in this way:
 Click (left-click) to zoom in.
 Right-click to zoom out.
To see the image at its actual size (100 percent), press Ctrl+Alt+N or choose
Window➪View Full Size.
Paint Shop Pro 8 also lets you magnify a portion of the image, rather than
have to enlarge the whole thing to see a detail. With either the Pan or Zoom
tool selected, choose View➪Magnifier or press F11. Move your cursor over an
area of the image, and a special 5x Zoom window shows you a close-up view of
that area. Repeat the command or press F11 again to remove the magnifier.
Working on several images at a time
You can open several images at a time in Paint Shop Pro. Each one gets its
own window. Having several images open is useful for tasks such as cutting
and pasting between images. To help manage those windows, use the com-
mands on the Paint Shop Pro Window menu. That menu contains the usual
suspects of nearly all Windows programs: Cascade, Tile (Horizontally or
Vertically), or Close All to close all image files.
Remember that Paint Shop Pro tools and commands apply to only the image
window that’s active (the one with the colored title bar). Click an image
window’s title bar to make that window active and bring it to the front.
Saving a Changed Image File
After you’re done modifying an image in Paint Shop Pro, you need to save it.
Saving an image in Paint Shop Pro is often just as easy as saving a Microsoft
Word document, for example. Choose File➪Save or click the Save button on
the standard toolbar (the diskette icon) or press Ctrl+S.
Paint Shop Pro quietly saves, in most instances, an image as the same type
(format) of file (JPG, for example) that it was when you opened it. It may,
however, raise a warning, depending on what changes you have made — see
the following sidebar, “When Paint Shop Pro offers a merger.”
If you have added text or shapes, or overlaid images on your original image,
saving the modified image as a Paint Shop Pro file is a good idea; see the fol-
lowing section.
16
Part I: Getting the Picture 

Saving the Image First As
a Paint Shop Pro File
If you bake a pie, you can (a) save it in a nice Tupperware pie carrier if you’re
taking it to a community supper (b) wrap it in plastic and freeze it if you’re
planning ahead for a holiday or (c) mush it into a little plastic bag and put it
at the bottom of your backpack if you’re going hiking. In all cases, you still
have tasty pie — but stored in ways that are appropriate for particular uses,
and not appropriate for others.
Likewise, you can save an image as many different types of file. Some types
are good for one purpose, and others for another. The choice depends on
what you (or the people you give the file to) intend to do with the image.
Another person, for example, may have Photoshop but not Paint Shop Pro,
and so may want a Photoshop file instead. Or, you may need a JPG, GIF, or
PNG file for putting on a Web page (which doesn’t display many of the other
image file types).
17
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, and Saving Image Files
When Paint Shop Pro offers a merger
Paint Shop Pro lets you do some sophisticated
modifications to an image, like adding fancy
text, shapes, or overlaying images. To simplify
this sort of image work, Paint Shop Pro keeps
some stuff on separate layers. (That way, you
can fool with your changes without messing up
the original.)
Not all file types (like JPG) can handle layered
images. So, if you start with a JPG image, put
text on it, and try to save it as a JPG image file,
Paint Shop Pro will have to combine all those
layers into one single layer, called a merged
image. Paint Shop Pro pops up the dialog box
shown in this figure.
We suggest that you decline this merger: Click
No. Then save your file as a Paint Shop Pro
image. If you must have an image of a certain
type (for example, a JPG or PNG file for a Web
page), save a copy of the image in that file type
instead. See “Saving a Copy of Your File As
Another File Type,” later in this chapter.

The best idea, however, is to first save the image as a Paint Shop Pro (PSP)
type of file, even if it started out life as a different type. Paint Shop Pro files
are a good choice because, among other things, they save layers and any cur-
rent selection you may have made during the editing process. Most other file
types don’t save that stuff. Some file types are “lossy” (like most JPG vari-
eties), which means that they may even lose quality. PSP files are sort of the
Tupperware solution.
After you have taken the precaution of making a Paint Shop Pro file, if you (or
the people to whom you’re giving the file) also need a different type of file,
save a copy as that other type of file. If you make subsequent changes to the
image, always make the changes to the Paint Shop Pro file and then make
copies of that file in the various file types you may need.
To save any image as a Paint Shop Pro file, first look at the filename on the
title bar, in the upper-left area of the Paint Shop Pro window. (The filename
appears after the words Jasc Paint Shop Pro.) The filename should end in a
period and three letters; if not, see the following sidebar “How the FPX can I
see the TIF, JPG, DXF, and other extensions?!”
If the filename has the extension .psp or .PspImage, simply choose File➪Save
or click the Save button on the toolbar. You’re done! (Your image was a Paint
Shop Pro file already; you just updated that file with your latest changes.)
If the filename ends in anything other than .psp or.PspImage, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save As.
The Save As dialog box appears.
2. Click the Save as Type box and select the Paint Shop Pro Image
option.
3. Select a folder and type a name for the file.
Do this exactly as you would to save a file in any other Windows program.
To save an image in a personal favorite folder, click the Favorites button,
the rightmost button on the Save dialog box’s toolbar. In the drop-down
list that appears, you can choose the My Documents folder. (We don’t
recommend saving in the Temp, or temporary, folder.) To add your own
favorite folder to the list, first open that folder in the Save dialog box.
Then click the Favorite Folders button and choose Add Current from the
drop-down menu. To remove a folder, choose Remove and then select
the folder from the drop-down list.
4. Click the Save button.
The image is now safely stored as the best file type possible for a Paint Shop
Pro user, with nothing lost.

Saving a Copy of Your File
As Another File Type
After saving the image as a Paint Shop Pro file (see the preceding section), if
you also need the image in a different file type, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save Copy As.
The Save Copy As dialog box appears.
2. Select the file type you want from the Save as Type box.
If you want to save the file as a Paint Shop Pro file, but in a form that 
earlier versions of Paint Shop Pro can read, click the Options button.
The Save Options dialog box appears; choose the version you want, and
then click OK.
If you’re saving the file as a non-PSP file, the Options button may be
grayed-out (disabled). If not, it provides access to variations on your
chosen format that can sometimes be useful, like reducing the file size
or putting the file in a particular form that somebody needs. The follow-
ing section provides a few examples of options.
3. Click the Save button.
When you save a copy in a different file type, the open file isn’t affected. It
remains whatever file type it was. If you have used layers (or floating selec-
tions) and save a copy as something other than a Paint Shop Pro file, Paint
Shop Pro may have to merge (combine) those layers into a single image. The
program displays a dialog box to warn you if it needs to merge layers into a
single image. That merge doesn’t happen to the Paint Shop Pro image you’re
working on, only to the file copy you’re creating. Don’t worry — just click Yes
to proceed.
Using Native and Foreign File Types
You often have to open or create files that are not a Paint Shop Pro file, and
knowing something about the file types can be helpful. The next sections
describe a few of the most popular file types. Each file type is identified by
the three-letter ending (extension) it uses. For example, Paint Shop Pro files
end with the extension .psp or .PspImage.
Most of the time, you don’t have to do anything special to open a particular
file type or to save your work as that type of file — but, then again, some-
times you do. Paint Shop Pro, in most cases, simply asks you a few questions
to resolve any problems when opening or saving a foreign file type.
19
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, and Saving Image Files

Paint Shop Pro files (PspImage or PSP)
PspImage is the native Paint Shop Pro 8 file type and is probably the best
choice for storing your own images. (It’s the metaphorical Tupperware stor-
age solution, if you have been following our pie storage metaphor.) When you
save your work as a Paint Shop Pro file, you can save everything just as it is,
including any areas you have selected with the Paint Shop Pro selection tools,
plus your various kinds of layers, palettes, tool settings (like current brush
width), transparency, and other advanced features. You can pick up almost
exactly where you left off. Paint Shop Pro files can have any color depth you
choose. (See Chapter 9 to understand what we mean by color depth.).
PspImage is the latest and greatest of the Paint Shop Pro native formats; ear-
lier versions used the PSP extension.
Programs other than Paint Shop Pro or Animation Shop don’t often read Paint
Shop Pro files, however. You may need to save a copy of your image in a dif-
ferent file type for someone who uses other software. Also, earlier versions
of Paint Shop Pro can’t read later Paint Shop Pro files (Paint Shop Pro 7 can’t
read Paint Shop Pro 8 files, for example.) To create Paint Shop Pro 5.0, 6.0,
or 7.0 files using Paint Shop Pro 8, see the instructions for saving a copy of
your image in the section “Saving a Copy of Your File as Another File Type,”
earlier in this chapter.

Part I: Getting the Picture 
”How the FPX can I see the TIF, JPG, DXF, 
and other extensions?!“
Image files are often referred to by the three-or-
more letter ending (extension) at the end of their
filenames. The file polecat.tif, for example, is a
TIF (or TIFF) file. On many computers, Windows
is set up to hide these extensions, which makes
your life harder when using Paint Shop Pro. If,
when you go to open a file in Paint Shop Pro, the
files don’t appear to end with a period and
three-letter extension (such as .psp, .bmp, or
.pcx), Windows is hiding valuable information
from you.
To reveal the extensions, do this: Double-click
the My Computer icon. In the window that
appears, choose View➪Folder Options (or in
Windows XP, choose Tools➪Folder Options) to
display the Folder Options dialog box. Click the
View tab there, and under Files and Folders,
Hidden Files, deselect the check box labeled
Hide File Extensions For Known File Types.
(Then click OK.)

BMP
BMP files are Windows bitmap files; that is, they were designed by Microsoft
for storing images, and many programs under Windows can read and write
them. BMP files can have color depths of 1, 4, 8, or 24 bits. (Set your color
depth by using Colors➪Decrease Color Depth or Colors➪Increase Color
Depth; see Chapter 9 for details.)
BMP files that are 24-bit can be quite large. When you save a file as BMP, you
can click the Options button in the Save As, or Save Copy As, dialog box to
choose higher compression (make smaller files). Under Encoding (in the
Options dialog box that appears), select RLE and then click OK. (RLE stands
for Run-Length Encoding, a way of making image files smaller.) Now, when you
save the file, Paint Shop Pro asks your permission to switch to a 256-color 
(8-bit) version of the BMP file. The resulting file is much trimmer than the
original, although the color quality may diminish slightly.
TIFF
TIFF (or TIF) stands for Tag Image File Format (which, of course, tells you
nothing useful). Many graphics programs on the PC and Macintosh can read
and write TIFF files, so it’s a good choice of file type when you don’t know
what kinds of files the other person can read.
TIFF files can be quite large unless you compress them. To compress a TIFF
file, click the Options button when using the Save As or Save Copy As dialog
box. Then choose the LZW Compression option in the Compression area of
the Options dialog box that appears. LZW gives you the best compression
and compatibility with most other programs. (No image quality is lost by
using LZW compression in TIFF files.)
For advanced users, TIFF is a good choice because it’s capable of storing
information not only in RGB primaries, but also CMYK (used for some high-
quality printed images). It can also store advanced data for color accuracy,
such as gamma.
GIF
The Web uses CompuServe GIF images all over the place. GIF is the most pop-
ular of three common file types used on the Internet. (JPG and PNG are the
other two.)
21
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, and Saving Image Files

Many programs read GIF files. (Older programs may read only the older
GIF standard, GIF87, rather than the newer GIF89a. Paint Shop Pro lets you
choose which standard to use when saving a GIF file — just click the Options
button in the Save As or Save Copy As dialog box.)
GIF is the metaphorical “frozen-pie” option if you’re following our pie
metaphor; saving your work as GIF means that it loses something, but per-
haps not enough to matter. GIF images have a maximum color depth of 256
colors, which allows fairly realistic images. That number of colors, however,
isn’t enough to enable Paint Shop Pro to do all operations, so it may at some
point suggest that you let it increase the number of colors. (See “ File Types
and ‘Action Required’ Messages About Colors,” later in this chapter.)
GIF enables you to use some special features, such as a transparent color
(which lets the background of Web pages show through), and interlaced dis-
play (in which the entire image gradually forms as it is downloaded from the
Web). GIF can use fewer colors than 256 if you want to save file size and,
therefore, save people who view your file on the Web downloading time.
A special Paint Shop Pro tool called the GIF Optimizer can help you set trans-
parency and otherwise optimize the image for Web use. See Chapter 17 for
details of creating images for the Web using this tool.
Some GIF files contain a whole series of images to be displayed as an anima-
tion. You can view these images using Animation Shop; Paint Shop Pro shows
you only the first image of the series.
JPEG
JPEG (or JPG) stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, which sounds
impressive. JPEG images are common on the Web for color photographs and
other realistic color images because their files are small (relative to other file
types) and download quickly.
The disadvantage of JPEG is that it usually uses something called lossy com-
pression, which means that the image quality is reduced a bit, especially
around sharp edges like text. Storing an image as a JPEG is kind of like stuff-
ing a pie into a baggie in your backpack for a hike. The basic taste and nutri-
tion are still there, and it doesn’t take up lots of space, but because of the
squeezing involved, the product may lose some of its appeal.
You can choose just how much squeezing you want in JPEG, but first storing
your work in some other format (preferably PSP) is a good idea. Then follow
the three steps for the Save Copy As operation at the beginning of this sec-
tion. In Step 2, choose JPEG-JFIF Compliant in the Save As Type selection box.
22
Part I: Getting the Picture 

Click the Options button; in the Save Options dialog box that appears, drag
the Compression Factor slider to the left for higher quality but larger files, or
to the right for lower-quality and smaller files.
The geeks at the Joint Photographics Experts Group have also come up
with a new, lossless variety of JPEG format. To save your files in this 
maximum-quality-but-largest-file-size format, select Lossless in the Save
Options dialog box.
If you’re reading JPEG files, Paint Shop Pro offers an effect that removes
some image distortions, called artifacts, that result from compression (see
Chapter 7).
As with GIF, Paint Shop Pro offers a special tool, the JPEG Optimizer, for
adjusting JPEG images for the Web. See Chapter 18 for details of fine-tuning
JPEG images with this tool.
PNG
PNG (Progressive Network Graphics) was designed to take over for GIF on the
Web, although it is catching on slowly. It does have some advantages over GIF
and accomplishes the same functions as GIF, so it may yet take over. Because
its main use is Web graphics, we discuss it a bit more in Chapter 18.
Using Vector File Types (Drawing Files)
Graphics images come in two main flavors: raster (also called bitmap) and
vector. Here are the differences between them:
 Raster (bitmap) images are made up of dots (pixels). Most computer
images are of this kind, and Paint Shop Pro is principally designed for this
kind of image. It both reads and writes a wide variety of raster images.
 Vector images are made up of lines, shapes, filled areas, and text. You
can change text, lines, and shapes more easily if they’re stored as vectors
than if they’re stored as bitmaps. Although Paint Shop Pro is principally
designed for raster images, it allows you to create vector layers that con-
tain lines, text, and preset shapes. Images stored as .psp files retain any
vector graphics you create. Paint Shop Pro can read certain vector image
files other than its own .psp files, but converts them to rasters.
Vector files are typically created by popular drawing software (as opposed to
painting software). AutoCAD, for example, a popular drafting application, writes
DXF (Drawing eXchange Format) files. Corel Draw writes CDR files, and Corel
WordPerfect uses WPG files. Many other vector file types are in use, too.
23
Chapter 1: Opening, Viewing, and Saving Image Files

Like Paint Shop Pro files, some other file types can also contain a mix of
vector and bitmap graphics. These include Windows Enhanced Metafiles
(EMF, a Microsoft Windows standard), Computer Graphics Metafiles (CGM,
a standard by the American National Standards Institute), PICT (a Macintosh
standard), and embedded PostScript (EPS, by Adobe). Some files (like embed-
ded PostScript) may contain in some cases both a bitmap and a vector ver-
sion of the same image.
Opening vector files
Paint Shop Pro can open many kinds of vector (or mixed vector and bitmap)
files. You can also copy drawings, using the Windows clipboard, from most
vector programs that run under Windows, and paste the images into Paint
Shop Pro.
Whether you’re opening or pasting vector images, however, Paint Shop Pro
converts them into bitmap images. To do the conversion, it pops up a Meta
Picture Import dialog box that wants you to enter a width and height for this
resulting bitmap image, in pixels. (Any dimension information in the original
file doesn’t survive the translation, so Paint Shop Pro needs some help
from you.)
Select the Maintain Original Aspect Ratio check box if you want to keep the
same proportions as the original image. Because Paint Shop Pro is translating
between two different kinds of image data, it may make a few mistakes that
you have to clean up afterward.
Saving vector files — not
You can’t save pure vector-type image files, such as DXF, in Paint Shop Pro.
You can, however, save your work as one of the file types that contains a mix
of vectors and bitmaps, such as EPS or CGM.
In those instances, PSP simply stores a bitmap image and leaves the vector
part blank. Because no vector data is stored, a program that handles only
vector graphics may not be able to read the file.
Converting or Renaming Batches of Files
If you have lots of image files and need copies of them in a different file type
or to have a series of related names like hawaii0001 through hawaii9579 for
your 9,579 vacation photos, try the Paint Shop Pro batch processing.
24
Part I: Getting the Picture 

To copy a bunch of files to a new file format, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Batch Processing➪Convert.
2. In the Batch Conversion dialog box that appears, hold down the Ctrl
key and click the files you want to convert, to select them.
3. Near the bottom of the dialog box, click the down arrow at the right
end of the Type selection box and select the file type you need the
files to be.
4. To put the newly generated files in a different folder, click the Browse
button and choose a new folder.
5. Click the Start button.
In a few seconds or minutes, you have copies in the new file type you need.
To give a bunch of files similar names, differing only by a number (as in
hawaii01, hawaii02) take these steps:
1. Choose File➪Batch Processing➪Rename.
2. In the Batch Rename dialog box that appears, hold down the Ctrl key
and click the files you want to convert, to select them.
3. Click the Modify button.
The Modify Filename Format dialog box appears. The idea is to combine
various naming and numbering elements into a sort of formula for Paint
Shop Pro to follow. For example, hawaii50 is a “custom text” element of
our choosing, followed by a two-digit “sequence.”
4. Click an element in the left panel to choose the first part of the new
name, such as Custom Text.
5. Click the Add button to add that element to your formula, which gets
assembled in the right panel.
Depending on what kind of element you choose, a one-line text box
appears on the right for you to make a choice or enter some text. We
stick with our simple example. If you have chosen Custom Text, type
your text (hawaii, for example) in the Custom Text box that appears.
If you have chosen Sequence, type a starting number in the Starting
Sequence box that appears; use as many digits as you need for the
batch (type 01 for 100 images). For today’s date, choose a date format.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to add more elements. Make sure that one of
your elements is Sequence, or else you’re asking the impossible: for
each file to have the same name.
The order in which you add elements on the right is the order in which
they appear in the filenames.

7. Click OK. When the Batch Rename dialog box returns, select the files
to be converted.
The files are all renamed, and each name includes a different number.
File Types and “Action Required”
Messages about Colors
When you try to use certain Paint Shop Pro features or save your work in a
non-PSP format, you may get an “Action required” message from Paint Shop
Pro, especially for images not originally in the Paint Shop Pro file format. For
example, you may open a GIF file and want to use one of the Paint Shop Pro
commands on the Adjust or Effects menu. Or, perhaps you want to add a
raster layer to that GIF file. Paint Shop Pro gives you an error message like
the one shown in Figure 1-3.
Don’t worry — be happy; just click OK. The issue is that certain file types, like
GIF, can handle only a limited number of colors (have limited “color depth”)
and many Paint Shop Pro features work only on images able to handle as many
as 16 million colors. Paint Shop Pro is offering to create a 16-million-color
image for you so that it can apply the tool you want to use.
If you get one of these messages, if you later save your work in the original,
color-limited file type (GIF, for example), you also get a message requesting
permission to reduce the number of colors back down to whatever that type
of file can handle. Simply click OK in whatever dialog box or boxes result, and
you will probably be happy with the result.
If you’re a professional and are picky, you understand what’s going on and
can take the necessary steps to control the result. You can always change
the number of colors manually by choosing Image➪Increase Color Depth or
Image➪Decrease Color Depth. You find more about color depth in Chapter 9.

Obtaining Image Files from the Web
The Web is a grab bag of goodies for graphics gurus. Here’s how to get your
hands on these fabulous fruits.
One of the best ways to get graphics is to find a Web site offering them free
and clear. Most of these sites provide instructions for downloading those
image files. To save an image that you’re viewing in your Web browser, use
the following methods:
 Right-click the image and, on the pop-up menu that appears, look for
Save Picture As or a similar choice. You’re prompted for the location on
your hard disk where you want the image saved.
 Right-click the image and, on the pop-up menu that appears, choose
Copy. This choice copies the image to the Windows Clipboard; open
Paint Shop Pro and press Ctrl+V to paste the image as a new image.
(Choose the Edit➪Paste command to see ways to paste the image into
another open image.) Save the image by choosing File➪Save.
A fair number of graphics images on the Web have transparent portions,
especially their backgrounds. The transparent parts of these types of image
have a hidden color (typically white), and that color may become visible in
Paint Shop Pro. See Chapter 18 for more information about transparency in
Web images.
Most Web images are one of only a few different file types: GIF, JPEG, or PNG.
GIF and some PNG images are palette images, with a limited number of colors
(typically, 256 colors). As a result of this color limitation, you may see some
of the “Action Required” messages discussed in the preceding section.
Many animations on the Web are GIF files. You should open animated GIF files
in Animation Shop, not Paint Shop Pro (which displays only the first frame of
the animation). Some animations are, however, in a private vector format
(Flash) that neither Animation Shop nor Paint Shop Pro can read.

here do your pictures come from? From your new digital camera?
From a piece of paper? Or, from your PC screen?
Ironically, most people don’t paint pictures in Paint Shop Pro. They get an
image from somewhere and then mess around with it. This chapter tells you
how to get that image into Paint Shop Pro.
Connecting to Your Scanner or Camera
Scanners and cameras can hook up in lots of ways to Paint Shop Pro and your
computer. One way is the Microsoft Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) method.
If your scanner or camera supports WIA, follow the instructions that came with
the device for installing and using WIA. Some WIA devices appear like a disk
drive when you open the Windows My Computer icon, and you can open or
copy images much like you open or copy files on a disk drive in Windows.
Otherwise, for WIA devices, use the Paint Shop Pro File➪Import➪Scanner or
Camera command to access the device through the vendor’s software. (We
can’t give you specific instructions for that process.)

In this chapter, our instructions assume that you’re using the longtime stan-
dard, the TWAIN software interface. However, the instructions also give general
scanning tips for everyone, regardless of what form of connection you use.
Scanning into Paint Shop Pro
With scanners almost as cheap as a carton of paper, scanning is one of the
most popular ways to get an image into a PC. Many people are surprised that
scanning is a more involved process than they expect. Getting an image from
paper isn’t quite as simple as putting an image on paper — unless quality
isn’t all that important.
If your PC is equipped with more than one TWAIN-based image-acquiring
device (scanners or cameras, for example), you need to tell Paint Shop Pro
which one you’re using before going through the following steps. Choose
File➪Import➪Twain➪Select Source. The Select Source dialog box appears.
Select your scanner (source) and then click Select.
In most instances, these steps scan an image from a properly installed scan-
ner that has a TWAIN interface (although your scanning software may differ):
1. Launch the scanning software that came with your scanner.
To do that, choose File➪Import➪TWAIN➪Acquire. (If your scanner uses
WIA, choose File➪Import➪Scanner or Camera.)
30
Part I: Getting the Picture 
Remarking on TWAIN
Mark Twain loved high-tech gadgets (such as
typesetting machines, the computers of his
day). Although he’ll never meet his namesake,
the TWAIN interface, we think that he would
have loved the happy accident of having his pen
name associated with today’s high-tech scan-
ners. (Incidentally, TWAIN, despite its capital-
ization, isn’t an acronym, although some wags
have suggested that it stands for Technology
Without An Interesting Name.)
TWAIN is a go-between that links scanners,
cameras, and other image sources to PC image-
processing software, like Paint Shop Pro.
Scanners are made by different manufacturers
and, therefore, speak different native languages.
To make translation easier for your PC, most
manufacturers have chosen to make their scan-
ners comply with a standard named TWAIN. As
a result, in graphics programs like Paint Shop
Pro, scanning usually involves a menu choice
named TWAIN.
A scanner is a sophisticated instrument that
needs software to control it. When you scan, your
PC launches a specialized TWAIN-speaking
scanner-controlling program. Scanner manu-
facturers install this program on your PC during
the scanner setup.

Or, press the Scan button on your scanner, if it has one.
Some special software designed to run your scanner should appear. (If it
doesn’t appear, read the literature that came with your scanner and check
to make sure that your scanner is properly installed.) Because that soft-
ware depends on the scanner manufacturer, we can’t tell you many details
about it. We give you some tips, however, in the following section.
Figure 2-1 shows the software that appears if, for example, you’re using a
Hewlett-Packard ScanJet.
2. Find and click the Preview button.
In Figure 2-1, for example, the Preview button is in the Preview window. If
you don’t find a button labeled Preview, look for a similar word. The scan-
ner starts to scan and then gives you a small preview image, as shown in
the Preview window in the figure. This preview image shows the entire
scanning area of the scanner (the glass area in a flatbed scanner).
3. Define the area you want to scan.
In most scanner software, you create a rectangle (the dashed line shown
in Figure 2-1) in the Preview area to define the area you want to scan.
(Drag from one corner of the part you want to the opposite corner.)
Usually, you can then drag this rectangle to adjust its position or drag its
sides or corners to adjust its size. If you don’t define the scan area in this
way, you may end up with an enormous image (your scanner’s entire field
of view) that you have to crop (trim) to the area you want.
Most scanner software allows you to enlarge (zoom in on) the preview
image. Look for a magnifying glass icon, click it, and then click the image.

Chapter 2: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen

4. Adjust settings that control the resolution or number of colors or
improve the appearance of the preview picture.
Scanner software often offers important features and controls, including
whether you want color or black-and-white scanning. In the ScanWizard
software shown in Figure 2-1, the controls are in the left window. We
describe these and other useful controls in the following section.
5. Find and click the Scan button.
If you can’t find a Scan button, look for a Start or Begin button. Figure 2-1
shows a Scan button next to the Preview button. The scanner begins to
scan again. (It may take longer or shorter than it did in Step 2.)
After the scanner is done, an image appears in Paint Shop Pro. You can now
close the scanner software window or continue to scan more images (starting
with Step 2). Each image gets its own window in Paint Shop Pro.
Getting the most from your 
scanning software
Whatever software your PC uses to control your scanner, it undoubtedly
offers certain settings to play with. For casual scanning of images that don’t
have problems (such as underexposure), you can often ignore lots of those
settings and do all your fiddling in Paint Shop Pro. Sometimes, however, the
controls in your scanner software can improve your image in ways that Paint
Shop Pro alone can’t — especially with moiré problems that occur when you
scan newspaper photos. (Although Paint Shop Pro has an adjustment that
removes moiré patterns, it’s not nearly as effective as fixing it at the source.)
32
Part I: Getting the Picture 
Scan-ty information
What exactly goes on in a scanner? Here’s a
quick tour. The scanner illuminates your image
while it moves a light sensor in a series of
straight lines across the page. As the sensor
goes along, it periodically samples (takes a
reading of) how much light is coming from one
tiny spot on the image. Usually, the scanner
uses three sensors combined, one for each pri-
mary color.
These readings are converted into digital num-
bers, one for each primary color. During the 
conversion process, the scanner makes an ad-
justment to account for the fact that electronic
sensors don’t see light the way the human eye
does. (This gamma adjustment, apart from scan-
ning, also has to be made by software when your
PC displays colors onscreen.) The scanner may
also make other adjustments as directed by the
scanning software.

You can usually adjust these settings after you do the preview. Except for res-
olution and color settings, the preview image reflects the changes without
running your scanner again.
Choosing the number of colors
To achieve the best quality possible with color photographs (and other
images that either have many colors or gradual, subtle shadings), you want
the maximum number of colors the scanner can produce. Usually, this maxi-
mum is expressed as 24-bit or 32-bit color. If your PC has disk space for the
large files this produces, scanning at this number of colors is best even if
your final application requires fewer colors. For the sake of control, it’s better
to have more colors than you need to start with and use Paint Shop Pro,
rather than the scanner, to reduce the colors (see Chapter 9).
If you know that your final application for the image doesn’t require such
high quality and you’re in a rush or your disk drive is short on space, you can
save yourself a bit of time in Paint Shop Pro by choosing fewer colors during
scanning.
Here are some scanner settings you may find, labeled type or color depth in
the scanner software, that usually work well for the following uses:
 Business or highest-quality personal use: Choose 16 million colors (24-
or 32-bit). (You can then color-reduce these images in Paint Shop Pro for
faster downloading in Web or e-mail applications.)
 Casual family or business Web page illustrations or snapshots to be
sent by e-mail: Choose 256-color if it’s available, although it’s not always
offered as a scanner option. Use 16 million colors if the 256-color option
isn’t available.
 Black-and-white photos, pencil drawings and sketches, or line drawings
with lines of varying weight: Choose 256 shades of gray. Scanners typi-
cally scan these types of image by looking for one particular color. If your
drawing is all in one color of pencil, such as green, it may not appear!
Check your scanner manual for notes on scanning grayscale (black-and-
white) images or line drawings, or avoid red, blue, or green pencils.
 Clear, original printed text with good contrast or line drawings in dark
ink or with thick lines: Choose two colors (1-bit), or line art, if available;
otherwise, choose 256 shades of gray. If you have a line drawing with
uneven line darkness, you can sometimes turn it into good line art by
adjusting either the Line Art Threshold or Highlight/Midtone/Shadow set-
tings. See “Setting contrast and other adjustments,” later in this chapter,
for more information about the latter setting.
33
Chapter 2: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen

Choosing resolution
Resolution is the number of dots (or samples) per inch that your scanner reads
from the paper image. Your scanning software has a control for resolution.
Higher resolution means that you get more detail — more pixels — which is
generally A Good Thing. For example, if you scan a 4-inch x 6-inch snapshot
at 300 dots per inch (dpi), you get an image of 4 × 300 (1200) pixels high and
6 × 300 pixels (1800) wide. (That’s even more pixels than most PC screens can
show at the same time.) You can always make a picture lower in resolution
(reduce its size in pixels) in Paint Shop Pro, if necessary, but you can’t add
detail that isn’t there in the first place.
Higher resolution also poses some problems. First, high resolution means
bigger files! If you’re just scanning a photo to e-mail to someone or to put on
the Web, the people viewing your photo won’t appreciate the long wait for a
large photo to download — especially if it’s bigger than their screen! You can
reduce a photo in Paint Shop Pro, of course, but why bother if you don’t need
to? Besides, sometimes the shrinking process (also called resampling) 
doesn’t give quite as good a result as if you had chosen the lower resolution
in the first place.
To judge which resolution to use, answer these questions:
 “How big of an image do I need?” For most Web and e-mail work, an
image 300 to 400 pixels on a side is plenty. Multiply the width or height
of the region you’re scanning (6 inches wide, for example) by the scan-
ner resolution you’re thinking of using (300 dpi, for example) to figure
out the resulting width or height in pixels (1800 pixels wide, in this
example). Select a lower resolution to get a smaller image in pixels.
 “How big a file do I want?” Scanning a 4-inch x 6-inch color snapshot at
300 dpi (and 24-bit color) can give you a file as large as 6 megabytes.
Cutting resolution in half can reduce the file size by as much as a factor
of four.
 “How finely detailed does the image need to be?” At 300 dpi, you can
begin to see an individual human hair placed in your scanner.
You probably don’t see any changes you make in resolution in your Preview
image. To see the effect of resolution settings, you have to scan an image into
Paint Shop Pro (click the Scan button in your scanner software).
Setting contrast and other adjustments
Some other adjustments available in your scanner software can make an
enormous difference in the quality of your image. Fiddle with these after you
34
Part I: Getting the Picture 

have clicked the Preview button in your scanner software so that you have a
preview image to look at as you make your adjustments. You may have to
poke around to find a button or command that reveals these adjustments, or
even discover that your software doesn’t offer them.
Many adjustments that scanning software offers are technical. We don’t have
room to fully do them justice here, but you probably don’t need them
anyway. We describe here a few of the important ones you may find:
 Brightness: Brightness makes all areas darker or lighter to the same
degree.
 Contrast: This adjustment makes dark areas darker and light areas
lighter.
 Exposure: Increasing Exposure makes dark pixels disproportionately
darker and brings out detail in the light areas.
 Shadow/Midtone/Highlight: The Shadow and Highlight values are also
called the black-and-white points, respectively. Sometimes they’re
unnamed, appearing as sliding arrows under a histogram chart. These
three settings are something like Contrast and Exposure, but more pre-
cise, which make an image’s dark areas darker and its light areas lighter.
They also bring out detail in the middle ranges of darkness and adjust a
too-dark or too-light image to a more pleasing appearance. Each setting
ranges from 0 to 255 (the numeric values correspond to brightness: 0 is
black and 255 is white). The choices are shown in this list:
• Shadow: To make the darker areas as dark as possible, adjust the
Shadow value upward. All pixels below that value become as dark
as you can make them without radically changing any colors.
• Highlight: To make light areas as light as possible, adjust the
Highlight value downward. All pixels above that value become as
light as possible without radically changing their colors.
• Midtone: If the rest of the image is, overall, kind of dark, adjust the
Midtone value downward; if the image is light, set the value higher.
 Descreen: Software like Microtek Scanwizard and Umax Vistascan have
special descreen capabilities, which means that they can minimize the
moiré patterns that arise when you scan printed images. Generally, the
software offers several settings that depend on whether you’re scanning
from a newspaper, magazine, or higher-quality printed source, like a
book. (You probably have to scan to see the result of descreening — it’s
unlikely that you can see it in the Preview.)
 Unsharp Mask: Try this feature (often lurking in an area named filter or
something similar) if your photo doesn’t look quite as sharp as it should.
35
Chapter 2: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen

Without making the image sharper, this feature gives the illusion of
sharpness. It raises the contrast around edges (where the pixel values
change). Unsharp masking has three settings:
• Amount: Adjusts the degree of contrast enhancement (sharpness).
• Radius: Determines how far from an edge the effect extends.
• Threshold: Sets a limit, below which an edge isn’t enhanced. A set-
ting that’s too low may make the image speckly.
(The numbers used in these settings have no intuitive meaning, so don’t
look for one. Just adjust them up or down.)
If you forget to use Unsharp Mask while scanning, you can use the Paint Shop
Pro Unsharp Mask effect after scanning. Choose Adjust➪Sharpness➪Unsharp
Mask and the Unsharp Mask dialog box appears. Make the same adjustments
listed in the preceding bullet. Figure 2-2 shows the Unsharp Mask effect, as
shown on a picture of one of the authors as a young Gene Simmons.
Many scanner programs offer check boxes to turn on automatic features (typ-
ically auto contrast and auto color correction). These features attempt to
adjust various settings for you, based on the preview scan. Sometimes they
work well and sometimes they don’t. Try enabling and disabling their check
boxes to see the result in the Preview area.
You can find an excellent, detailed guide to using the features of scanning
software — in fact, to using your scanner in general — on the Web at
www.scantips.com.

Forever plaid: Scanning printed images
When you scan a printed image from a newspaper, magazine, or book, your
image often acquires a blurry checkered plaid or barred pattern. This pattern,
called a moiré (“mwah-RAY”) pattern, is caused by conflict between the dots
used to print your image and the dots that happen during scanning.
The next time you put your windows screens up or down, you can see this
same effect if you look through two screens at the same time. Or, if you have
a screen porch, stand outside and look through the two screens where they
meet at a corner.
The moiré pattern may exist only on your PC screen in Paint Shop Pro and
not in your image file, as Figure 2-3 illustrates. In this figure, the zoom of 1:3
(noted on the title bar) is responsible. Try viewing the image at full scale
(press Ctrl+Alt+N), or larger. If the pattern disappears, the pattern is just the
effect of using a zoom of less than 1:1. Don’t worry about it. When the image
is printed at a high printer resolution or used on the Web at full size, that 
pattern probably won’t appear. If the pattern is still visible at a 1:1 zoom, it’s
permanent and you need to do something about it.
Permanent moiré pattern problems? Try these solutions:
 Higher resolution: The pattern may fade if you set the resolution of
your scanner’s software (the dots-per-inch value) higher.
 Descreening: If your scanner software provides descreening, use this
option. See “Setting contrast and other adjustments,” earlier in this
chapter, for more information.
 Special filter: Choose Adjust➪Add/Remove Noise➪Moiré Pattern
Removal (see Chapter 7).
37
Chapter 2: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen
Dots not nice!
Why do scans of printed images get moiré pat-
terns? Unlike photographic prints and painted
or drawn artwork, printed images are made up
of ink dots of varying sizes at a certain spacing.
This effect wouldn’t be a problem, except that
your scanner also uses dots — and they’re of a
different size and spacing.
Your scanner reads the image by sampling the
image (looking at tiny spots on the image) at
some spacing (your chosen resolution in dots
per inch). The samples don’t align exactly on the
printed dots, except every 10 or 20 pixels, for
example; the rest of the time, they align partly
on the dots and partly on the white background.
The usual result is a checkered or barred pat-
terning on the image. Something similar can
happen when Paint Shop Pro displays the
image on your PC screen, which also uses dots.

Printed images pose more problems than just moiré patterns. Although the
images appear to have a wide variety of tones, printed images are composed
of alternating dots of primary colors (black-and-white photos have only two
colors, for example). When these images are scanned (particularly at high
resolution), they retain that spotty, dotty character. Zoom in to see them.
As a result, Paint Shop Pro features that use color selection and replacement
don’t work as your eye would lead you to expect. An area that looks uniformly
green, for example, may be made up of blue and yellow dots. You can’t select
that green area of your scanned-in logo, for example, because it’s not really
green! This problem gets worse at higher resolutions.
To partially solve this problem, you can apply the Paint Shop Pro blur adjust-
ment (see Chapter 7) to make the dots blur together. If you have problems
selecting a colored area with the Magic Wand tool (see Chapter 12), try
increasing the Tolerance setting in the Tool Options dialog box.
Straightening crooked scans
Lining up your photos neatly across the bottom of most scanners is a pain —
and even then you normally don’t get it quite right, leading to a tilted picture
of your sweet snookielumps. Fortunately, Paint Shop Pro has a useful tool
that straightens your pictures for you.
Here’s how to get your pictures to straighten up and fly right:
1. Select the Straighten tool from the Deformation toolset, as shown in
Figure 2-4.
Figure 2-3:
A moiré
pattern
appears on
this roof, but
isn’t an
image flaw.
38
Part I: Getting the Picture 

2. Find a horizontal line in your crooked picture that should be level,
but isn’t.
In Figure 2-5, which we show you momentarily, that line is the top edge
of the photo. In other images that don’t have easily accessible photo
edges to work with, try looking for flat horizons (oceans disappearing
against the sky are usually a good bet), pictures, benches, kitchen coun-
ters, or windows.
This tilted straight line is your way of telling the Straighten tool, “If you
rotate the image until this line is perfectly level, the image will be fixed.”
So choose it carefully!
If your image has no horizontal lines that you can use but it does have ver-
tical ones, you can use the Straighten tool on a vertical line as well. Paint
Shop Pro notices that your baseline is vertical, not horizontal, and instead
rotates your image so that the baseline is perfectly north-to-south.
3. Position the Straighten line so that it’s next to your baseline.
A straightening line, complete with a handle on each end, appears in
your picture. Move your mouse over it until the cursor becomes a four-
headed arrow with a line over it, as shown in Figure 2-5.
Click and drag the Straighten line to the tilted line you have chosen to
use as a baseline.
Figure 2-4:
The
Straighten
tool, hidden
among the
Deformation
toolset.
39
Chapter 2: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen

4. Click and drag the handles on each end of the Straighten line until
both of them are on the tilted line you have chosen.
When you’re finished, the Straighten tool should be lying along the edge
of your baseline.
If you want to have your image automatically cropped to snip out the
blank spaces around the edge of the picture after it has been straight-
ened, check the Crop Image box on the Tool Options palette (press F4 if
you don’t see the palette).
Double-click your image to straighten it (and crop it, if you have
chosen to).
5. Make sure that it’s straight!
For the picture shown in Figure 2-5, we chose to use the top edge of the
photo as a baseline for straightening . . . and we were wrong. As you can
see in Figure 2-6, we have adjusted the image so that the photo is level,
but the photo itself was taken at an angle (as though it weren’t embar-
rassing enough)! On the right side of the figure, William is on the level —
a feat he would not manage to duplicate until years later.
Press Ctrl+Z to undo any changes. Note that when we went back and
straightened the image again using the top line of the television set as a
baseline, it came out much better.

Getting Images from a Digital Camera
Paint Shop Pro can be a great tool for digital photography. First, however, you
have to get your camera and your PC talking to each other. They have to con-
nect (interface in geek-speak) physically and in software:
 Physical interface: Digital cameras physically connect to PCs in all kinds
of ways. Your physical connection may be a serial port (a connector on
the back of most PCs, if a modem or something else isn’t already using
it), a parallel (printer) port, a USB port, a FireWire port, a memory card
that plugs into your computer, a floppy disk, an infrared beam, X-rays,
semaphore flags, or magical auras — who knows what the camera people
will come up with next? See your camera manual for details. You also
probably have to set a switch on your camera to prepare it for sending
images to the PC.
 Software interface: You also need a software interface, unless your
camera stores photos on some disk or other device your PC can read.
(In that circumstance, pop the floppy disk, memory stick, or whatever in
the proper place in your PC, copy the files to a folder on your hard disk,
and open the files in Paint Shop Pro.)
Cameras come with the interface software they need, and to read photos
from your camera, you need to install it. If the installation gives you a
way to install either a Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) interface or a
TWAIN interface, you’re in business. If the installation program lets you,
Figure 2-6:
The image
on the left
has been
adjusted so
that the
photo is
straight, but
the photo
itself is
crooked.
41
Chapter 2: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen

avoid installing any freebie image software (like a cheap Paint Shop Pro)
that comes with the camera. If you do, the installation process may
assign certain image file types to that program rather than to Paint Shop
Pro. If that happens, refer to the sidebar in Chapter 1 about making Paint
Shop Pro open the right file types when you double-click.
Many cameras have TWAIN-compliant software because TWAIN is a long-
standing PC standard that allows every program on your computer to
talk to image-acquisition devices, like cameras and scanners.
If your digital camera uses WIA, you need to follow the instructions that came
with the camera. In Paint Shop Pro, choose File➪Import➪From Scanner or
Camera to open camera files using the WIA method.
Downloading and Opening Photos
If you have on your computer more than one TWAIN device (a scanner and
your camera, for example), first choose File➪Import➪TWAIN➪Select Source.
In the Select Source dialog box that appears, click the camera and then click
Select.
To begin the downloading process, choose File➪Import➪TWAIN➪Acquire.
Some form of dialog box, similar to the one shown in Figure 2-7, arrives on
the scene.
Figure 2-7:
Transferring
one or more
photos to
your PC with
a TWAIN-
compliant
camera —
in this case,
an Olympus
D-340R.
42
Part I: Getting the Picture 

If you have more than one TWAIN source set up (like a scanner and a camera
on the same computer), choosing From Camera or Scanner starts up the
scanner rather than the camera. Yes, it’s irritating if you use your camera
more than your scanner.
If that’s the case, choose File➪Import➪TWAIN➪Select Source to access your
camera; a small dialog box, showing all your TWAIN-compliant devices, is 
displayed. Click the one that has a name something like your camera model
(ours was Olympus Digital Vision 3.0 33-32) and click OK. Then choose File➪
Import➪TWAIN➪Acquire to start your camera’s download.
As in the scanner section, we can’t tell you exactly how this process happens 
because the interface that downloads the pictures is unique to each camera.
Fortunately, most of them are similar; they present a selection of thumbnails
or preview images you can flip through in some manner.
If you don’t see a set of thumbnail images, you may need to hunt for a Get
Previews button or menu option.
You see buttons or menu options that allow you to accomplish these
common camera tasks:
 Download photos — the whole enchilada: Look for a Download All,
Save All, or perhaps (as in the Olympus example) Select All command
before you can click the Download button. Downloading means that your
photos go directly to your PC’s disk drive, as files. You don’t see them in
Paint Shop Pro. You then can open them in Paint Shop Pro by choosing
File➪Open, as you can any other image file (refer to Chapter 1).
 Download selected images — the ones where your child isn’t sticking
out his tongue: Browse through the thumbnails (which are sometimes
also called previews), which you can generally do by clicking the left and
right arrows under the thumbnail image, or scrolling up and down. The
exposure number, date, and time appear next to the image in some cam-
eras, and others may have an Information or Details button to display
details.
When you come to a tongue-free or otherwise desirable photo you want
to download to your PC, click the image you like and then look for a Save
to Disk or Download button or something similar. (You can select multi-
ple images by holding down Ctrl while you click.) You then can open
them in Paint Shop Pro by choosing File➪Open.
 Erase the images where your child is sticking out his tongue: Browse
through the thumbnails and find the offending images. Click that image
and first try pressing Delete, and then look for a Delete, Erase, or Trash
button. Clicking this button removes the image from your camera.
43
Chapter 2: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen

 Open a particular image in Paint Shop Pro: Browse through the thumb-
nails (as the preceding bullets describe) to that image. Click the image
and then look for an Open button. You can also open all images in Paint
Shop Pro if you select them all and then press Open. That choice may
use so much memory, however, that Paint Shop Pro becomes sluggish.
To save an open image to disk, refer to the instructions for saving a file
in Chapter 1.
For most makes of digital cameras, downloading images doesn’t delete them
from the camera. Erasing images, however, generally does wipe them from
the camera, which you want to do to clear out space for future photos.
Making E-Mail-Ready Photos
William’s family means well. About twice a month, they send him pictures of
his niece Amanda. Unfortunately, these pictures are the size of billboards and
take about an hour-and-a-half to download, preventing him from doing any-
thing else while he waits for the new picture to arrive.
He loves Amanda, but it’s not worth waiting 90 minutes just to see a picture
of her.
Chances are, your friends feel the same about your pictures: They want to
see your little bubbeleh, but they want to see her quickly. Unfortunately,
scanners and digital photos, left to their own devices, give you the biggest,
the most detailed, and above all the largest files they can possibly produce.
On the Internet, large files mean large download times — and long waits.
Shrinking Photo Download Times
Your friends never tell you that they hate waiting four hours for a picture of
your newborn; they just force a smile and say “Those humongous photos
were lovely.” Be proactive and take these steps to condense your photos —
and save your friendship!
1. Crop the photo so that it shows only the important parts.
If Amanda is on the right side of the picture, there’s no sense in showing
everyone the wallpaper in the left half of the room. Cropping is ridicu-
lously easy, and we show you how to do it in Chapter 11.
2. Reduce the physical size of the photo.
Most digital cameras produce photos roughly the size of this page; the
smaller the photo, the quicker it downloads. Again, this information is in
Chapter 11.
44
Part I: Getting the Picture 

3. Reduce the quality of the image.
It sounds horrible — our darling Amanda, in a low-grade image? — but
the fact is that most images can have their quality reduced by 10 or 20
percent without anyone noticing a thing — and it saves lots of download
time. We show you how to compress photos in Chapter 17.
Capturing Images from Your PC Screen
There it is, onscreen: the exact image you need. But it’s in some other pro-
gram, not Paint Shop Pro. You figure that there must be some way to get it
into Paint Shop Pro — after all, it’s already in your computer.
You’re right. Paint Shop Pro has several different ways to capture that image.
When an image appears in a window on your PC, it comes with all kinds
of other stuff that is part of the program displaying the image: toolbars,
status bars, a title bar, and a sushi bar, for example. Maybe you want that
stuff, and maybe you don’t. Paint Shop Pro helps you capture only the part
of the window you really want: It’s most likely an image, but if (like us) you’re
illustrating software, you may want to see just a toolbar from the program
window or where a mouse cursor is pointing. For all these captures, use the
Paint Shop Pro capture features, on the Capture menu.
Preparing to capture
To set your snare, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Import➪Screen Capture➪Setup from the menu bar.
The Capture Setup dialog box, as shown in Figure 2-8, comes to your aid.
Figure 2-8:
Setting your
snare for

wildlife.
45
Chapter 2: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen

From left to right in the figure, you can see that you have three kinds of
choices: what you want to capture, how you want to trigger (activate)
the snare, and a couple of options (Include Cursor or Multiple Captures).
2. Choose what to capture.
Paint Shop Pro can capture five different species of Windows wildebeest.
In the Capture Setup dialog box, choose one of the possibilities listed in
Column 1 of Table 2-1.
Table 2-1
Using Different Types of Capture
Type of Capture
What It Does
Area
Captures a rectangular area you define anywhere 
onscreen.
Full screen
Captures the whole nine yards, the entire enchilada, the 
full Monty — everything onscreen.
Client area
Captures everything in a window except the title bar.
Window
Captures the application window you specify (don’t use 
for a document window; use Object for that).
Object
Captures an application window, a document window, or
any individual feature in a window, like a toolbar — a 
useful catchall category that works for toolbars, menu 
bars, scroll bars, palettes, and sometimes portions of 
those objects.
3. Choose your trigger.
You must choose a trigger, which is an action (such as pressing a particu-
lar key) that you take, after setup finishes, to tell Paint Shop Pro to start
capturing images. Without a trigger, the capture would start immedi-
ately. All you would ever capture is Paint Shop Pro itself! In the Capture
Setup dialog box (refer to Figure 2-8), you can see that you have three
choices for triggering the capture. Select one of these options:
• Right mouse click: A right mouse click begins the capture.
• Hot key: From the Hot Key selection box, choose a key to serve as
a trigger. You can choose any of the function keys, F1 through F12,
alone or in combination with Shift, Alt, or Ctrl. F11 is initially
chosen for you.
• Delay timer: Select this option and then enter a delay time (in sec-
onds) in the Delay Timer box.
46
Part I: Getting the Picture 

4. Choose options.
Paint Shop Pro gives you two options:
• Capture multiple images: If you plan to capture a series of
onscreen images, select the Multiple Captures check box in the
Capture Setup dialog box (refer to Figure 2-8). You then can simply
snap a series of images without returning to Paint Shop Pro each
time. If you’re creating a tutorial for using some software, for exam-
ple, you can set up Paint Shop Pro and then easily capture a screen
for each step.
• Include mouse cursor in capture: You may want to show the
mouse cursor in your screen captures to point out some feature. If
so, select the Include Cursor check box in the Capture Setup dialog
box (refer to Figure 2-8).
Using the Include Cursor option may not work if you’re only capturing an
object. You need to use your cursor to select the object, placing the cursor
somewhere other than where you want it in the picture. If you’re capturing a
client area or window, you have to be sure that your cursor is within the cap-
tured area.
Making the capture
After you’re set up to capture from the PC screen in Paint Shop Pro, you’re
ready to make the capture. To capture an image, follow these steps:
1. Click the Capture Now button in the Capture Setup dialog box.
The Capture Now command starts the capture process. (Or you can
press Shift+P.) Paint Shop Pro discreetly shrinks to a button on the
taskbar to get out of your way.
2. Make any last-minute changes to the thing you want to capture.
You have a final opportunity to adjust the appearance of the screen area
that contains the image — before you trigger the capture. If you have
chosen the option of capturing the mouse cursor, position the cursor now.
3. Trigger the capture (or wait for the timer to trigger it).
Depending on the kind of trigger you chose (refer to Step 3 in the pre-
ceding section), either right-click with your mouse, press the hot key
(F11, for example), or wait for the time interval to elapse.
If you’re capturing a full screen, Paint Shop Pro restores itself to full
window size now. You’re done and can skip the next steps. Otherwise,
Paint Shop Pro waits for you to choose your capture area.
47
Chapter 2: Capturing Pictures from Paper, Camera, or Screen

4. Choose the capture area (unless you’re capturing the full screen).
How you choose the capture area depends on what kind of capture you
have chosen, as shown in Table 2-2.
After you choose the capture area, the capture occurs instantly. Paint
Shop Pro immediately restores itself to its original window size (unless
you have chosen the multiple capture option) and displays the capture
as a new image.
5. Repeat Steps 3 and 4 if you have chosen the multiple capture option.
Paint Shop Pro acquires each capture as a separate image. You don’t 
see them because Paint Shop Pro remains minimized as a button on the
taskbar. To restore Paint Shop Pro, click its button on the Windows
taskbar.

rectangle encloses the object you want, left-click.
For better and easier captures, read and heed these tips:
 Set up your screen the way you want it to look before you enable the
trigger (before you press the Capture Now button or press Shift+P). If
you try to make adjustments after you set the trigger, you may acciden-
tally trigger the capture.
 To enhance colors — for those captured colors that come out fairly
accurate, but faded, murky, or otherwise less than satisfactory — see
Chapters 7 or 10.

f you need to paint, spray, ﬁll, erase, or otherwise get
creative with brushes and paint, start here. Begin with
paint in Chapter 3. The wild new Paint Shop Pro Materials
palette goes beyond basic paint and lets you ﬂow gradients
(shadings), patterns, and textures right off your brush.
Choose paint that simulates the texture of scribbling on
surfaces like asphalt, brick, or wood, or apply a real wood-
grain pattern. Simulate three-dimensional shading with 
gradient ﬁlls, or paint in patterns of neon colors.
In Chapter 4, we show you the magic of the Paint Shop Pro
basic brushes and other hand tools. Discover how to get
exactly the stroke and effect you want. Paint Shop Pro lets
you easily control brush attributes, such as shape, soft-
ness, paint transparency or thickness, spray patterns, and
evenness of ﬂow. Even erasing can be an art in Paint Shop
Pro — and erasing has never been easier, with the Paint
Shop Pro 8 new Background Eraser tool, which can
remove the ugly wallpaper behind Aunt Tillie without
removing Aunt Tillie!
For real magic, we show you in Chapter 5 how to make
images ﬂow right off a paint brush. We introduce you to the
magic of the Clone Brush tool, which is useful for seam-
lessly retouching photographs by brushing a duplicate of
patterns, backgrounds, or other areas that already exist in
a photo. We also discuss the Paint Shop Pro Picture Tubes
tool, which applies a sort of spreadable clip art. Need a
cloud of butterﬂies? Wave the Picture Tube tool.

efore you go flinging your paintbrush around with wild abandon, choos-
ing a color to fling is a good idea (unless, of course, you’re one of those
devil-may-care creative types). Here’s where to get the inside story on the
fastest and best ways to choose a color under various circumstances.
In Paint Shop Pro, however, you don’t just paint with color. How boring and
pedestrian! No, you paint with materials! Material, in this case, is the Paint
Shop Pro way of referring to anything from plain old solid colors to textured
colors, gradients (shaded areas with transitions from one color to another),
or even multihued geometric patterns. Your work can look like you’re rubbing
chalk on concrete or spray-painting an elephant’s ear or doing something else
far more interesting than just smearing paint smoothly on paper. Any of these
effects can be smeared across the page at your whim. Think of the Paint Shop
Pro drawing tools as multicolored felt-tip markers with an adjustable tip. You
can even save your carefully designed materials as swatches for future use.
In Paint Shop Pro, material is a catchall term that includes color, any textures
you have applied to that color, and any patterns or gradients. This concept is
slightly confusing because most users work with plain colors and ignore all
this patterning and texturing jazz. If you’re confused, whenever you see the
word material, think color. It won’t hurt.

All this excitement springs from the Material palette, which in Paint Shop Pro
8 hides more secrets than a black dog hides ticks. Figure 3-1 shows the
palette and some of its more important features.

Part II: Painting the Picture 
”Help! I just want plain, solid paint!“
Are you getting weird, patterned, or thin paint —
perhaps not even in the color you chose —
when you just want plain, unpatterned color?
Are you getting no paint at all? The problem is
that you have somehow chosen a fancier style
than plain paint, chosen a texture, or requested
a transparent material.
Here’s how to return to the ordinary, using con-
trols on the Materials palette:
Click the Style button (the leftmost one) just
under the Foreground Material box (refer to
Figure 3-1 to find these buttons) and then click
the solid black dot in the drop-down panel that
appears. If the Material box has a checkerboard
pattern in it, click the Texture button once (the
middle one under the Foreground Material box).
The checkerboard pattern (indicating texture)
disappears. If the Material box is grayed out
with the international No slash through it, trans-
parency is enabled; click the Transparency
button (the rightmost button under the Material
box) to turn transparency off. To do the same
thing for your background color, repeat these
steps for the Background Material box.

If the Material palette isn’t on your screen, press F6 or choose View➪
Palettes➪Materials. Palettes are lumps of useful tools and settings in Paint Shop
Pro; the Materials palette is one of them. You can drag them around to different
places in your Paint Shop Pro window; they stick (dock) to various edges.
Here’s a summary of what the various parts shown in Figure 3-1 do:
 Colors tab: Click with either of the mouse buttons on this area to pick
up a color conveniently from the spectrum of available colors and put it
in a Material box, where you can paint with it. Left-click and the color
becomes the foreground (principal) color. Right-click and it becomes the
background (secondary) color. As you scroll the pointer across the color
panel, you see a preview of the color and three numbers (the primary
colors) that define exactly what color your cursor is pointing at. These
colors can be in either the RGB system, the HSL system, or HTML hexa-
decimal format; see Chapter 10 to understand these numbers better.
If you see fewer colors than Figure 3-1 shows, your image has 256 colors
or fewer. See “Working with 256 Colors or Fewer,” later in this chapter.
 Swatches tab: If you create a cool material that you don’t want to forget —
an ochre-and-purple gradient, for example, with a torn-paper texture that
would be a pain to re-create (and a pain to look at, but hey, we’re not here
to judge), you can save it as a swatch for future use. It works the same
way as the Colors tab: Left-click a swatch and it’s loaded into the
Foreground Material box, which takes on all aspects of the swatch, 
including color, pattern, texture, and opacity. Right-click and it becomes
your background material. When you first install Paint Shop Pro, it has 16
sample swatches for you to try, but you can save many more than that.
 Foreground Material box: This setting is the best single indicator of
what you’re going to paint, and it’s what you look at most often. It has
three buttons: Style (which controls whether your material is a plain

Chapter 3: Choosing Colors, Styles, and Textures
Ignoring the color boxes
In past versions of Paint Shop Pro, the Colors
box was pretty much all that most people knew
about; adding snazzy textures or patterns was
handled via a dialog box that was conveniently
buried underneath about 15 menus. Realizing
that confusing people is a strategy that works
only for Microsoft, Paint Shop Pro has moved
away from the Colors box and moved toward
the Material box, an all-in-one stop that allows
you to change your colors, textures, and pat-
terns in just a few clicks.
However, because too little confusion is never
enough, Jasc has left the Colors box on the
Material palette for those rare occasions when
you would want to switch colors, but not any
textures or patterns you have applied. Most
people never do this, so our advice is to simply
ignore these two little remnants and do all your
work in the Material box — with one exception,
which we get to later in this chapter.

color, gradient, or pattern), Texture, and Transparency. If none of those
three buttons accomplishes what you’re looking for, you can click the
Material box to bring up a rather comprehensive dialog box of options.
Paint Shop Pro also refers to foreground material as the stroke material
because you use it for the line or stroke that defines shape outlines.
 Background Material box: This box works exactly like the Foreground
Material box. Background materials are simply a second painting color
used for either two-color operations or as a convenient second color
that gets applied by tools whenever you use the right mouse button.
Paint Shop Pro also refers to this material as the fill material because
you use it to fill shape outlines.
 Style button: Choosing a color is all fine and well, but sometimes you
want more than an ordinary paintbrush. You can select one of three
options from this drop-down menu. Most people opt to stay with plain
paint, but you can also apply a multihued pattern called a gradient or
add a pattern called, well, a pattern (a geometric or photograph-like
image). Paint Shop Pro assigns rather boring gradients and patterns to
the style buttons when you first install it, but we show you how to
change them later on in this chapter.
 Texture button: Clicking this button applies a kind of roughness that
appears wherever you paint foreground color or style. If it’s selected,
as it is in this image, the Material box has a checkered pattern to it.
 Transparency button: Clicking this button instantly transforms the
material so that it has no color, texture, or pattern. This button is useful
sometimes when you’re working with text or vector objects — but not
regular paintbrushes or fills, so it’s unavailable when you’re working
with those tools.
 Switchers: As you may have gathered from their name, switchers switch
foreground and background settings. Two switchers are available: The
smaller one swaps colors but keeps all patterns and textures where they
were, and the larger one swaps everything. Click the switcher’s two-
headed arrow icon to switch.
 All Tools check box: Quite often, you just want to retouch a color in one
spot, but don’t want to change the materials you have already assigned
to your paintbrush. Clearing this check box restricts any changes you
make to the tool you’re working with — change the Paint Brush tool all
you like, and it doesn’t affect the Fill tool in the least.
 Foreground Color: Unless you have chosen a fancier style than plain
paint, this box shows you what you paint when you apply a tool to the
canvas with the left mouse button pressed. (Paint Shop Pro also refers
to this color as the stroke color.) This box is something of a dinosaur,
and we advise you to simply ignore it; see the preceding sidebar,
“Ignoring the color boxes.”
56
Part II: Painting the Picture 

 Background Color: This box shows you what color you paint when you
apply a tool to the canvas with the right mouse button pressed. (Paint
Shop Pro also refers to this color as the fill color.)
Choosing Paint
How do you choose what color to paint with? To choose any color, from
screaming chartreuse to insipid indigo, just click the Paint Shop Pro palette
of colors.
Or, in full and gory detail, it goes like this:
1. Move your cursor over the Available Colors panel on the Material
palette.
Figure 3-1 points out that area: the multi-hued box that (unless you have
moved the Material palette) lives in the upper-right corner of the Paint
Shop Pro window. (If you don’t see the Material palette, display it by
pressing the F6 key on your keyboard.) The cursor is a Dropper icon
while it’s over this area, to indicate that you pick up a color if you click.
(If you see a bunch of tiny, colored boxes rather than a large, rainbowish
blur, click the Colors tab along the upper-left side of the palette.)
As you move the cursor, you see an enlarged sample of the color your
cursor is over. The primary color values give you the exact numerical
color you’re using.
2. Left-click to choose your main painting color, called the foreground
(or stroke) color.
That color appears in both the Foreground Material box and the fore-
ground color sample (refer to Figure 3-1).
This color is what we sometimes call the left-mouse-button color — it’s
the one that appears when you use the Paint Brush, Airbrush, or Fill tool
by pressing the left mouse button. It doesn’t have much to do with fore-
ground. It’s just one of two colors.
3. Right-click anywhere on the available colors area to choose a sec-
ondary color, the background (or fill) color.
See the following sidebar “Do you need a background color?” to figure
out whether you need or want a secondary color; if the answer is No, you
can skip this step. If you do choose a background color, it appears in the
Background Material box, as shown in Figure 3-1. The term Background
color, like Foreground color, is kind of a misnomer because it doesn’t have
much to do with the background of your image. It just defines a second, or
alternative, color you can work with.
57
Chapter 3: Choosing Colors, Styles, and Textures

Check to make sure that the Foreground Material box (or Background
Material box, if that’s what you chose) displays the color you chose. If not,
the palette is set up to paint patterns, which have their own colors. Click the
Style button under the Foreground (or Background) Material box and then
click the solid dot (for solid paint) or the striped dot (for gradient paint). 
See the upcoming section “Working with Style: Beyond Plain Paint” for more
information about gradients and patterns and transparency. Or, for plain
paint, see the earlier sidebar “Help! I just want plain, solid paint!”
Here are a couple of tips for choosing and using colors:
 To swap the background and foreground colors, click the Material
Switcher (the larger double-headed arrow), as shown in Figure 3-1.
The background color becomes the foreground color and vice versa.
Just to make things confusing, you can choose to click the smaller
button, which swaps colors but not any textures or gradients. Our
advice: Unless you have a good reason to do otherwise, always click the
big arrow.
 To get pure black, white, red, yellow, or other “just plain” colors, use
the Color Picker. (We describe this tool in the following section.) You
can also find pure black and white along the bottom of the Colors panel;
pure black is on the left, and pure white is on the right.
58
Part II: Painting the Picture 
Do you need a background color?
How do you know whether you need or want a
secondary color? It depends on the tool you’re
using and how you intend to use it:
 If you want to be able to switch quickly
between painting with one color and
another, you can paint foreground color
with the left mouse button on many tools
and background color with the right mouse
button.
 The Shapes tools require a background
color if you want solid shapes. If you plan to
draw filled-in squares (as opposed to just
the outline of a square), you need to choose
a background color to fill the shape in with.
 If you’re using the Eraser tool, you can
choose what the eraser leaves behind: a
transparent streak (useful if you’re using
layers) or the background color.
 If you’re using a tool that involves two
colors — for example, the Color Replacer
tool to replace one color with another —
you need a second color, and the background
color is that second color. Background color
also provides the fill of filled shapes and
text.

Choosing a basic color or
a recently used pattern
You may want to use your everyday, smiley-face yellow — but locating exactly
that same color in the Available Colors area is often next to impos-sible: Your
eyes and fingers can’t be that precise. Likewise, you may have developed a
cool gradient that slid from cool blue to a sea green, but do you think that you
can do that again?
Fortunately, Paint Shop Pro gives you another way to choose a recently used
material: the Recent Materials dialog box. The Recent Materials dialog box
also gives you basic black, totally white, and a variety of other basic colors
you can return to again and again.
Here’s how to get this helpful box of recently used materials and basic colors:
1. Right-click the Foreground Material or Background Material box,
whichever one you want to set.
The Recent Materials dialog box appears, as Figure 3-2 shows. The ten
most recent materials you have used appear along the top two rows; ten
standard colors appear along the bottom rows (including black, white,
and two shades of gray). If the colors have circles with slashes, you’re
using a palette image, and those colors aren’t available. See Chapter 10
for a discussion of increasing the number of colors.
Colors in the bottom two basic-color rows are pure colors — except for
the grays — that is, they are the reddest red, bluest blue, magenta-est
magenta, and so on.
Technically speaking, the top row contains the pure red, green, and blue
primary colors of radiant light. The second row contains the pure cyan,
magenta, and yellow primary colors of printed ink.

Chapter 3: Choosing Colors, Styles, and Textures

2. Click any color or material to choose it (or press the Esc key if you see
nothing you like).
The Recent Materials dialog box disappears immediately. The color you
clicked is now chosen and appears in the color sample on the Materials
palette.
You may think that right-clicking in the Recent Materials dialog box
would choose the background color, as it does on the Materials palette.
You would be wrong. Right-clicking does nothing here.
To get shades of color other than the ones you see in the Recent Materials
dialog box, click the Other button. This button takes you to the Material dialog
box. See the upcoming section “Choosing a Color More Precisely” for details.
Choosing a recently used color
Choosing that same fantastic shade of fluorescent orange you may have
already used involves the same problems as selecting a pure color. We tell
you earlier in this chapter that most of the time you should ignore the Color
boxes except for one instance — and here it is:
1. Right-click the Foreground or Background Color box — whichever
one you want to set.
The Recent Colors dialog box appears, as Figure 3-3 shows. The ten
most recent colors you have used are in the top two rows of the dialog
box, and the ten pure colors — exactly the same colors from the Recent
Material box — are in the bottom two rows. If the colors have circles
with slashes, you’re using a palette image, and those colors aren’t avail-
able. See Chapter 10 for a discussion of increasing the number of colors.
2. Click any color to choose it (or press the Esc key if you see nothing
you like).
The Recent Colors dialog box disappears immediately. The color you
clicked is now chosen and appears in the color sample in both the Color
and Material boxes. Again, right-clicking does nothing here.

Part II: Painting the Picture 

Choosing a color from your picture
Sometimes, the easiest way to choose a color is to pick up that color from
your picture. You have two ways to pick up color. Choose the one that makes
your life easier:
 When using any tool that applies paint (for example, the Paint Brush
tool), hold down the Ctrl button and the cursor turns into a Dropper
icon. Left-click to pick up foreground color, and right-click for back-
ground color.
 On the Tools toolbar, click the Dropper tool icon, as shown in the
margin. (If you see no Dropper icon, you may have been using the Color
Replacer tool — click the Color Replacer tool and select the Dropper
icon from the drop-down menu.) The cursor turns into a Dropper icon.
Left-click to pick up foreground color, and right-click for background
color.
If you have deselected the All Tools check box, colors you select for one tool
don’t apply to other tools.
Choosing a Color More Precisely
Choosing a color from the Material palette’s Available Colors area is all well
and good, but if you’re working with higher-quality color images, it’s not a
precise way to go. The area is tiny, and as many as 16.7 million colors may be
squished together in that area. (If your image has 256 or fewer colors, you
can discern individual color boxes in the Available Colors area.)
61
Chapter 3: Choosing Colors, Styles, and Textures
Choosing paint for each tool separately 
or all tools together
In real life, if you paint with your brush dipped in
red paint and then switch to spray-painting with
a can of green paint, your brush remains red. It
doesn’t switch to green. Of course, in real life
you can’t insert your dog into a picture of Elvis
and then spray-paint him purple, so you have to
assume that Paint Shop Pro is a little stranger
than the world outside your door.
Unless you tell it otherwise, Paint Shop Pro
applies the same style and texture to all the
tools you’re using; if you use the Spray Paint tool
with red paint and a rough texture and then
switch to the Paint Brush tool, the paintbrush is
red with a rough texture. You can, however,
choose to change this rather odd behavior by
unchecking the All Tools box on the Material
palette. Checking All Tools applies your current
paint choice to all tools; deselecting All Tools
means that you choose paint individually for
each tool.

To choose a color more precisely, left-click the Material box (foreground
or background, whichever one you want to set). (If the Style button is in
Gradient or Pattern mode, their respective dialog boxes are displayed. Don’t
worry — a row of tabs is at the top. In that case, click the Color tab.)
The amazingly colorful Material dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-4, appears.
(What’s that? You say that it looks funny and has rows of tiny boxes where
the color wheel and Saturation/Lightness box should be? In that event, you’re
working with an image that has fewer than 32,000 colors. See the upcoming
section “Working with 256 Colors or Fewer.”)
Precise color using the color wheel
The callouts shown in Figure 3-4 give you the simplest way to be more precise.
You need to follow only three steps:
1. Drag the little circle on the color wheel to the basic hue you want.
Hue has a technical meaning, but forget about that for now. Hue means
basic color, apart from that color’s exact shade.
The square in the middle of the circle turns to your chosen hue, showing
you all kinds of variations in shade — or, more precisely, in color inten-
sity (called saturation) and lightness. The square is the Saturation/
Lightness box.
2. Drag the little circle on the square to the precise shade you want.
The Current swatch in the lower-right corner of the dialog box shows
exactly what color you’re choosing, overlaid with any textures you have
selected. (The Previous swatch shows the foreground or background
color.)
62
Part II: Painting the Picture 
Creating shadows and highlights
For brushing highlights or shadows onto an
object, you often want a color that’s the same
hue as an existing one — just a little lighter or
darker. Pick up the existing color from your pic-
ture, making it the foreground color by clicking
it with the Dropper tool.
Click the Foreground Material swatch to bring
up the Material dialog box and then click the
Color tab, if it isn’t already selected. In the
Saturation/Lightness box, drag the tiny circle up
to make a shadow color, or down to make a
highlight color.

Drag this circle up to make your color darker or down to make it lighter.
Drag the circle left to make your color grayer, or right to make it more
intense (saturated).
3. Click OK.
Your foreground or background color has been changed.
Additional shades of basic colors
The Color tab in the Material dialog box (as shown in Figure 3-4) is also home
to 48 basic colors. These colors are shades of 6 primary colors (red, yellow,
green, cyan, blue, and magenta) plus 6 shades of gray (including white and
black).
Open the Color dialog box as usual by clicking either the Foreground Material
box or the Background Material box and selecting the Color tab.

Chapter 3: Choosing Colors, Styles, and Textures

Choose a basic color by clicking it in the Basic Colors area, in the middle-left
corner of the dialog box. Click OK and your foreground or background color
is changed to your chosen color.
Precise color adjustments — 
by the numbers
Just as saying “1 foot, 3 inches” is much more precise than saying “a little
bigger than my shoe,” choosing a color by using numbers is much more pre-
cise than clicking it on a palette or color wheel. But, how can you do color by
the numbers?
As it turns out, you can specify any color by using just three values. Adjusting
these values independently gives you more control. For example, you can
change just the lightness of a color and be certain that you haven’t changed
the hue.
Chapter 10 gives you more detail about how these values relate to colors. For
now, knowing that you can set these three values in the Material dialog box
can help you make more precise adjustments, if you need them.
Just as with specifying distance, where you can use either the English (feet,
inches) or metric (meters) systems, you can use one of three alternative sys-
tems to specify colors: Hue/Saturation/Lightness (HSL to its friends) or
Red/Green/Blue (known as RGB), or HTML.
The Color tab in the Material dialog box, as shown in Figure 3-4, shows the
three values that describe your chosen color in all three systems (RGB, HSL,
and HTML). The area displays values for Red, Green, and Blue (on the left) and
Hue, Saturation, and Lightness (on the right). When you choose a new color
using any control in this dialog box, those numbers change. In value, the num-
bers range from 0 to 255. An optional visual control appears when you click
and hold the down arrow at the far right end of a value box (see Figure 3-5).
To adjust a color precisely, you can edit the numbers in either the RGB or
HSL value boxes (your choice). For example, do you want more red? Use the
RGB controls and increase the value in the Red box. More yellow? To use
the RGB controls, you would have to know that red and green make yellow
in the RGB system (perhaps having read Chapter 10) and then increase the
values in Red and Green (perhaps decreasing the value in Blue).
Figure 3-5:
Numerically

64
Part II: Painting the Picture 

The HTML value is a numerical representation of the three RGB values, ren-
dered into one hexadecimal code that Web browsers like Internet Explorer can
understand. You should never try to adjust a color using the HTML value. If
you’re designing for the Web, though, the only way to tell a browser that a side-
bar should be precisely this shade of red is to use hexadecimals. If you’re a Web
designer, you know that you can use the HTML value within the color attrib-
utes of HTML; if you’re not, you can safely ignore this section and go in peace.
Using the HSL values is sometimes a more intuitive alternative to using the
RGB values. HSL values are connected to the controls on the color wheel and
the Saturation/Lightness box. Here’s how they work:
 Hue: The Hue value connects to your chosen position on the Color
wheel, beginning at zero at the top (red) and increasing as you go
around the circle counterclockwise. As you increase the number, the 
hue passes through red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, violet, and magenta.
 Saturation: The Saturation value connects to horizontal motion in the
Saturation/Lightness box: left (for a lower value) or right (for a higher
value). Use a higher value for a more intense (saturated) color.
 Lightness: The Lightness value connects to vertical motion in the
Saturation/Lightness box: up (for a lower value) or down (for a higher
value). Use a higher value for a lighter color.
As with any value box in a Windows program, you can change the values by
either typing new numbers or clicking the tiny up and down arrows to gradu-
ally increase or decrease the value.
A more visual way to fiddle with the RGB or HSL values is to click the down
arrow at the far right end of any of the RGB or HSL value boxes. As Figure 3-5
shows, a multicolored bar appears, showing the range of colors you can
achieve by dragging left or right. Holding the mouse button down, drag left
or right to choose a color. Release the button when you’re done.
Working with 256 Colors or Fewer
Images that have 256 colors or fewer are palette images: They use only a spe-
cific set of colors — the image’s palette of available colors. You can change
any of those colors individually, but you can’t have any more colors than the
palette size (color depth) allows. (See Chapter 10 for ways to change color
depth.)
When you work with a palette image, the Available Colors area of the Color
palette shows you the palette. You can choose any of those colors by clicking
the color. The squares are tiny, however, and colors aren’t always in a useful
order.
65
Chapter 3: Choosing Colors, Styles, and Textures

To choose colors from larger squares or see them in a more useful order,
click one of the Material boxes and select the Color tab from the Material
dialog box. You see a somewhat larger view of the palette. To reorder the
colors, click the Sort Order drop-down list box, choosing either Palette Order
(an arbitrary, numbered order), By Luminance (ordered from light to dark),
or By Hue (ordered by color). To choose a color, click it; then click OK.
To change any color on the image’s palette, choose Image➪Palette➪
Edit Palette. The Edit Palette dialog box that appears is identical to the 
Select Color from Palette dialog box, with one exception: If you double-click
any color on the palette, the Color tab in the Material dialog box is displayed.
See the section “Choosing a Color More Precisely,” earlier in this chapter,
for instructions on choosing a color in this dialog box.
Working with Style: Beyond Plain Paint
In Paint Shop Pro 8, painting in a single, flat color is just the simplest of three
painting modes called styles. (Whether or not you can use the other two
kinds of styles depends on which tool you’re using.) Those styles, controlled
by the Style button on the Materials palette, deliver these effects:
 Solid color: Plain old color
 Gradient: A cool multihued shading
 Pattern: A seamless photographic-quality surface, like wood grain or
gravel, or repeated images of your own design
After you choose a style and it’s displayed in the Material box, you can
choose from a cool variety of shades and patterns by simply clicking the
swatch. The details are in the following sections.
Choosing a style
To choose a style, click the Style button (underneath the appropriate
Foreground or Background Material box). Figure 3-6 shows the result.
A tiny menu flies out, displaying icons for the three styles (color, gradient,
and pattern, in order). Any icons that are grayed out aren’t available in your
chosen tool. To choose a style of painting, click the appropriate icon as
described in these bullets:
66
Part II: Painting the Picture 

 Color style (solid circle icon): The Material box displays just a solid
color: your chosen foreground or background color.
 Gradient style (Shaded icon): The Material box displays the chosen gra-
dient. To choose a different gradient, click the Material box to access a
gallery of gradients; see the following section for details.
 Pattern style (Waffle icon): The Material box displays the chosen pat-
tern. To choose a pattern, click the Material box to access a gallery of
patterns; see “Choosing and making patterns,” later in this chapter, for
details.
Choosing gradients
After your chosen (foreground or background) Material box shows a gradient
style (refer to the list in the preceding section for instructions), click the
Material box to choose a different gradient. The Gradient tab in the Material
dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-7.
Here’s what to do:
1. Choose a gradient style by clicking one of the buttons in the Style area
that appears on the left side of the Gradient dialog box (See Figure 3-7).
Each button depicts a different kind of gradient: from side to side, from
center to edges in a rectangular or circular fashion, or proceeding radi-
ally around in a circle. The Preview box on the left then displays a gradi-
ent in your chosen style.

2. Click the down-arrow button to the right of the Preview box and

The colors of all choices are prechosen, except for those that use the
terms foreground and background. Those choices make use of whatever
foreground or background colors are current at the time you paint with
this gradient.
3. Customize the angle or center of the gradient by dragging the control
in the Preview window.
Gradients in the linear style (linear is the leftmost button in the Style
column) have an angle setting. In the Preview window, drag the gadget
that looks like the hand on a clock to set the angle.
Gradients in other styles have a center point. In the Preview window,
drag the crosshairs to set the center point.
4. Make the gradient pattern repeat several times if you want.
Increase the number in the Repeats value box.
5. Click OK.
Your chosen gradient appears in the Material box of your choosing
(Foreground or Background).

Part II: Painting the Picture 

Creating gradients in your choice of colors is easy, although not many pat-
terns are available for that purpose. Choose a foreground or background
color or both as the one or two colors for your gradient. In the gradient
gallery, choose any gradient you like that uses the term foreground or 
background.
Creating your own gradient patterns is possible, as is altering the existing
ones, but — wow! It’s definitely not a For Dummies kind of project. If you want
to fool around with the controls, click the Edit button on the Gradient tab in
the Material dialog box to access the Gradient Editor dialog box. Whoa! Have
fun; try dragging the little pointers around, and good luck.
Painting with gradients
Gradients fill a painted area with a series of colors. When you paint with a
gradient using the Text, Draw, or Preset Shapes tools, or fill with a selection
using the Flood Fill tool, Paint Shop Pro scales the gradient to fit within the
object you have created or area you have selected. For example, to apply a
sunset-like gradient from blue to orange to the sky in your photo, select the
sky and use the Flood Fill tool. Paint Shop Pro ensures that the full range of
colors (blue to orange) fills the sky area. Or, if you create text and use a gradi-
ent style, the text displays the full range of colors.
If you paint with the Paint Brush or Air Brush tool, however, the gradient is
scaled to the entire image. If you paint with a sunset-like blue-to-orange gradi-
ent, anything painted near the top of the image is blue and anything near the
bottom is orange.
Choosing and making patterns
Patterns are interesting surface images, like brick or wood, or other more
exotic or creative patterns not found in nature. Their colors are fixed, like
those in a photograph, and are unaffected by your choice of foreground or
background color. The patterns that come with Paint Shop Pro are seamless,
which means that they can maintain an unbroken pattern, filling any area
without appearing like tiles (with distinct edges). The process of choosing a
pattern is much like choosing a gradient.
With your chosen material (foreground or background), click the box and
select the Pattern tab in the dialog box that appears. The Pattern tab slightly
resembles the Gradient tab shown in Figure 3-7, but it’s not as complicated.

Chapter 3: Choosing Colors, Styles, and Textures

1. Click the down-arrow button to the right of the Preview box and
choose from the boffo gallery of patterns that appears.
The preview window shows your choice.
2. Customize the angle of the pattern by dragging the clock-hand Angle
control to point in any direction.
3. Click OK.
Your chosen pattern appears in the Material box.
To apply a pattern to an existing image, try the Sculpture effect, setting its
Depth control to 1. We describe artistic effects and how to use them in
Chapter 8.
Applying a Texture
Textures give a result like rubbing chalk on concrete, or like rubbing a pencil
on paper that is placed over a coin or another raised surface. Paint Shop Pro
supplies a variety of textures, such as concrete, construction paper, and
bricks. When you use one, anything you do with the Paint Brush, Erase,
Airbrush, Fill, Text, Draw, or Preset Shapes tools displays that texture.
Textures don’t change your choice of color. Textures do work with solid
color, gradients, or patterns — that is, with any material.
You can apply texture to either the foreground material, the background
material, or both; you can turn textures on or off by either clicking the tex-
ture button on the Material palette or using the Material dialog box that pops
up whenever you click the Material box. Texture is normally turned off (dis-
abled). To use a texture, follow these steps:
1. On the Material palette, click the Foreground Material box or
Background Material box.
Figure 3-8 shows the dialog box that appears — and regardless of
whether the Material dialog box is asking for color, gradient, or pattern,
the texture information is always on the right side.
2. If the Texture check box isn’t checked, check it.
Or, alternatively, if you don’t want texture right now, uncheck it.
3. Click the down-arrow button to the right of the texture sample.
A gallery of textures appears, as Figure 3-9 shows. Scroll down the
gallery to find a texture you like.
70
Part II: Painting the Picture 

4. Click the texture you want in the gallery.
The gallery disappears and the sample area of the Texture dialog box
shows your chosen texture.
5. Customize the angle or scale of the texture by dragging the controls in
the Preview window.
Textures have an angle setting that allows you to spin the setting around to
point in any direction you want the textures to face. In the Preview window,
drag the gadget that looks like the hand on a clock to set the angle.

Chapter 3: Choosing Colors, Styles, and Textures

You can also make the texture larger or smaller by typing different per-
centages in the Scale box; you can shrink the texture to a tiny 10 percent
of its normal size or swell it to a massive 250 percent.
6. Click OK in the Material dialog box.
The Material box you originally clicked displays your chosen texture,
laid over the top of any colors, gradients, or patterns you have selected.
Now, anything you create or erase appears textured.
Paint Shop Pro remembers the last texture you used — so even if you stop
using a texture, all you have to do click the appropriate Material box to bring
up this dialog box again, and then click the check box to reenable it.
To apply a texture to an existing image, use the Texture effect we describe in
Chapter 8.
Storing Custom Materials to Use Again
After you have done all this texturing and gradienting and coloring, sometimes
you don’t want to have to re-create it all again the next day. The Swatches tab
in the Material dialog box also provides a place to store swatches of material
to save the colors and patterns you want to use repeatedly.
A material is a combination of a color and any effects, like textures or patterns,
that you have applied to them. It’s still a material even if you haven’t applied
any textures or patterns to the color.
To save a material, follow these steps:
1. Click the Material box of the material you want to save.
2. Click the Add to Swatches button in the Material dialog box.
This step displays a dialog box in which you’re asked to name your 
colorful creation. Name it as you like, and then click OK.
Your material is now stored on the Swatches tab, ready to be accessed
whenever you want. Click OK if you’re done using the Material dialog box.
Using a Stored Material
This task is so easy that you can do it in two clicks. Of course, if you have a
number of swatches, sorting through them all can be cumbersome.
72
Part II: Painting the Picture 

1. Select the Swatches tab on the Materials palette, as shown in
Figure 3-10.
2. If you need to narrow the number of available swatches in order to
find one, left-click the View button of the Swatches tab and hold the
button down.
A drop-down menu appears, where you can choose one of four options:
all swatches, colors only, gradients only, or patterns only. Choosing one
hides all others until you change the view.
To find out more about each swatch, hover the cursor over the swatch;
a small, informational pop-up message appears, giving you the name of
the swatch in question, the RGB numbers, the types of textures in the
swatch, and the names of the gradients and patterns used.
3. Click the swatch you want to use.
Left-click it if you want it to be in the Foreground Material box, right-
click if you want it to be in the Background Material box. Whatever tool
you use next is now loaded up with that swatch’s material.
Deleting a Stored Material
Deleting a swatch is so easy that it’s scandalous we’re getting paid to tell you
how to do it (don’t worry — writing the rest of this chapter was darned hard
work):
Figure 3-10:

Chapter 3: Choosing Colors, Styles, and Textures

1. Select the swatch you want to delete.
Remember that you can sort through the swatches if you need to hunt
one down, as discussed in the preceding section.
2. Click the Delete button on the Swatches tab.
74
Part II: Painting the Picture 
Texture thins your paint
When you use texture, paint goes on thin (with
low opacity) with each click or stroke. Make
repeated strokes or scribble with your paint tool
to build up the thickness.
Likewise for the eraser: Only a thin layer of paint
comes off with each pass. Disable Texture and,
on the Tool Options palette, set Opacity to 100 to
erase fully in a single stroke.
When you use texture with the Fill tool, make
repeated clicks if you need to increase the
opacity.

W
hether you paint like Rembrandt or like Phil (the guy who paints
Dave’s house), Paint Shop Pro can help you do your thing. You can
use a brush, a sprayer, or an eraser or simply pour the paint on. Use different
sizes and shapes of brush. Use paint, chalk, markers, or even different kinds
of paper. Paint Shop Pro can do nearly anything you can do with real artist’s
media. (Okay, body painting loses something in the translation.)
We talk about fundamentals of painting, spraying, and filling in this chapter,
including basic tool options, such as brush size, that apply to many other
tools. Paint Shop Pro has other features we cover in other chapters of this
book. For example, Paint Shop Pro draws as well as paints. Its drawing fea-
tures mimic tasks you can do with a pen or pencil, using a straightedge or
template of basic shapes. We discuss those tools in Chapter 15.
Paint Shop Pro also has fancy painting tools for a job that only a computer
(or perhaps a character in a cartoon) can do, such as paint with pictures that
flow right off your brush or paint a copy of one part of the image onto
another part. We discuss these special tools in Chapter 5.
As with most jobs you do in Paint Shop Pro, painting affects only the active
layer and only the selected area. If it appears that a painting or retouching
tool isn’t working, make sure that you’re on the right layer and working
within a selected area (or clear the selection by pressing Ctrl+D). If you don’t

use more than one layer or don’t have any current selection, don’t worry
about those restrictions. Also, remember that by pressing Ctrl+Z, you can
undo any painting or erasing.
Choosing the Tool for the Job
Figure 4-1 shows the Paint Shop Pro Tools toolbar. The toolbar is normally on
the left side of your Paint Shop Pro window, but you can drag it elsewhere —
to the top, the right side, the bottom, or even a free-floating toolbar hanging
about in the middle of the screen! Left-click the small horizontal row of slashes
just above the Pan icon and hold down the mouse button; the toolbar is sud-
denly surrounded by a large, thick line to indicate that it’s ready to go. Drag it
to wherever you want and then let go. You can double-click the title bar to put
it back in place, anchoring it to the side.
Figure 4-1:
The Tools
toolbar.
76
Part II: Painting the Picture 

Choose your tool (the Paint Brush tool, for example), by clicking the small
down arrow next to the toolset and then selecting its icon from its toolset
menu. Your cursor then becomes that tool (it displays that tool’s icon) when-
ever the cursor is over your image.
Throughout the rest of this chapter, we give you the details, but here are the
jobs you can do with each tool and the simplest description of how each one
works:
The Brush toolset
Take a look at the Brush toolset in Figure 4-2, which you rapidly become
familiar with:
 Paint Brush: Click the Paint Brush tool, click a color on the Material box,
and then click or drag your image to paint.
 Airbrush: Click the Airbrush tool, click a color on the Material box, and
then click or drag the image to mimic the effect of a spray can or airbrush.
 Warp Brush: Click the Warp Brush tool and then drag it across your
image to smear it like a finger painting or stretch it like it’s taffy.
Figure 4-2:

toolset, in all
its glory.
77
Chapter 4: Painting, Spraying, and Filling

The Eraser toolset
The Eraser toolset, as shown in Figure 4-3, conveniently eradicates all the
ugly portions of your image:
 Eraser tool: Click the Eraser tool and drag across the image to erase.
 Background Eraser: Click the Eraser tool on the background of the
image you want to see gone, hold the tool down for two seconds, and
then drag it slowly across the image to erase.
Figure 4-3:

78
Part II: Painting the Picture 
Don’t forget textures, gradients, and patterns
In Paint Shop Pro, if you can paint it with a color,
you can apply a texture to it. Textures apply your
chosen color as though you were rubbing on a
surface of some kind, such as asphalt pavement.
To texturize a color, click the Material box (the
one with the color in it) to display the Material
dialog box, and then check the Texture box in the
upper-right corner and select a texture from the
drop-down menu. To remove a texture from a
color, click the texture button underneath the
box — it’s the middle button, the sort of grainy
one. Visit Chapter 3 for help.
You can also apply gradients and patterns with
any tool that applies paint. These special shad-
ings and images are determined by the Style
button underneath the Material box. Again, refer
to Chapter 3 for instructions.

The Flood Fill tool
To fill an area with a solid color or a fade, click the Flood Fill tool, click a
color on the Material box, and then click within a selection area or an area of
a particular color to fill that area.
The Color Selection toolset
Oh, we show you the Color Selection toolset in Figure 4-4, but the only thing
you care about in this chapter is the Color Replacer tool.
To replace a color, click the Color Replacer tool, choose the color to replace
and the replacement color, and then drag or double-click the image.
Using Basic Artist’s Tools: Paint Brush,
Airbrush, and Eraser
Using the Paint Brush, Airbrush, and Eraser tools is much like using real
paint, paper, and erasers. Okay, okay — you would never use an eraser on
paint in real life, but you get the idea.
Figure 4-4:
The Color
Selection
toolset.
79
Chapter 4: Painting, Spraying, and Filling

In Paint Shop Pro, however, you don’t simply paint a color — you paint a
material. A material is the combination of a color and any patterns, gradients,
or textures that you have added onto it. As we advise in Chapter 3, whenever
you see the word material, you can think color — but if you want more detail,
Chapter 3 tells you how to put exactly what you want in the Material box.
Like most Paint Shop Pro tools and commands, the Paint Brush, Airbrush,
and Eraser tools do their thing on the active layer of your image. If they don’t
seem to be working correctly or are grayed out, you may be on the wrong
layer. See Chapter 14 for more information about layers.
Painting with the Paint Brush
or Airbrush tool
The Paint Brush tool, like a real paintbrush, paints a spot of paint when you
click it on your image or a line when you drag it. The Airbrush works simi-
larly, but like a can of spray paint, it puts down a speckly spot or line that
gets denser as you hold the button down.
The Airbrush tool paints speckly and the Paint Brush tool paints solid for a
reason: Jasc initially gives the two tools different density settings on the Tool
Options palette. You could easily change their density settings and make
the Paint Brush tool paint speckly or the Airbrush tool paint solid. The real
difference between the tools is that if you pause the Airbrush tool or move it
slowly while keeping the mouse button pressed, paint continues to fill in the
speckles. As a result, you increase the paint density just as you can with real
spray paint. Not so with the Paint Brush tool: You would have to click repeat-
edly to get that effect.
Otherwise, the two tools work similarly. Here’s how to paint with the Paint
Brush or Airbrush (spray can) tools:
80
Part II: Painting the Picture 
Painting a straight line
Can’t draw a straight line? Paint Shop Pro
comes to your rescue. The starting point of the
line is the last place you clicked, or wherever
your last brush stroke ended.
To create a straight line from that point, hold
down the Shift key and click where you want
the line to end. This trick works with all the tools
from the Brush toolset (Paint Brush, Airbrush,
Warp Brush) and with the Eraser tool.

1. Select the Paint Brush or Airbrush tool from the Brush toolset.
2. Inspect the Foreground Material box to make sure that it shows the
colors you want to paint with.
If you want a pattern, gradient, or texture applied to that color, make
sure that the appropriate Style and Texture buttons are selected.
See Chapter 3 for more information about choosing colors, styles, and
textures.
If you can’t paint with anything and a small international No sign with a
slash cuts through the box, you may have accidentally set your color to
Transparent. To undo this setting, click the small button directly under-
neath the Material box — the one that has the small No slash on it.
3. Change the options for your brush on the Tool Options palette, if
you want.
If the industry standard Paint Shop Pro brush doesn’t tickle your fancy,
here’s where you get to change the kind of brush you paint with; you can
make it a tiny, crisp square or a ghostly, rocket ship-shaped brush or a
watercolorish schmearer. We go over this technique in the next section,
but feel free to experiment. It’s fun! (If you don’t see a Tool Options
palette along the top of your image, press F4 on your keyboard.)
4. Drag on your image (or click to make just a single spot).
As you drag or click with the left mouse button, you apply whatever
material you have selected in the Foreground Material box. (To apply
the background material, click or drag with the right mouse button.)
If you’re using the Airbrush tool, you can keep the cursor in one place
and hold down the mouse button. The paint density gradually builds up.
If the spot or stroke doesn’t look right, press Ctrl+Z (or click the Undo button
on the toolbar) to undo it; you may need to use the Tool Options palette to
change the brush features. See the upcoming section, “Controlling Strokes,
Sizes, Shapes, and Spatters: Tool Options,” for details on changing appear-
ances.
Erasing with the Eraser tool
Erasing works a bit differently on different layers of your image:
 If you erase on the background layer, you apply whatever material is in
the Background Material box! (If your image began its life with a trans-
parent background, which isn’t usual, the erased area becomes transpar-
ent instead.)
81
Chapter 4: Painting, Spraying, and Filling

 If you erase on any layer other than the background layer, the erased
area becomes transparent. If the background texture box shows a tex-
ture, you get textured transparency! Style settings don’t matter.
Here’s how to erase:
1. Click the Eraser tool, as shown in the margin.
2. Check the Background Material box to make sure that its style, color,
and texture (if any) are what you want to leave behind as you erase.
If the current selections in those boxes aren’t what you want to leave
behind, see Chapter 3 to find out how to change them. For unpatterned,
untextured erasing, set the Background style to a solid color (using the
Paintbrush icon) and deselect the Background texture button.
3. Drag on your image to erase, or click to erase a single spot.
Drag with the right mouse button pressed if you want to leave behind
Foreground style and texture.
If the size, shape, and density (speckliness) of your eraser aren’t what you
want, press Ctrl+Z (or click the Undo button on the toolbar) to undo; see the
section “Controlling Strokes, Sizes, Shapes, and Spatters: Tool Options,” a
little later in this chapter.
Erasing backdrops with the
Background Eraser tool
A common problem in any Paint Shop Pro project is erasing specific areas;
for example, you want to erase an ugly wallpaper print — but not Cousin
Charlie, who’s standing in front of it. You could carefully erase that ghastly
wallpaper, pixel by pixel. Not only is that method incredibly time-consuming,
though, but also one slip of the wrist and you have accidentally removed his
left elbow.
The incredibly handy Paint Shop Pro Background Eraser tool makes this
process easy by doing some complex calculations to determine what is
Charlie and what is the background behind Charlie and then automatically
erasing that background. (You can also select around Charlie to make normal
erasing easier; we get into this topic in Chapter 12.)
For example, in Figure 4-5, erasing the jagged edge between the rocks and the
Alaskan sea would have been a huge deal in previous versions of Paint Shop
Pro. Thanks to the miraculous Background Eraser, though, it was all done in
one clean sweep!
82
Part II: Painting the Picture 

Just to confuse you, Paint Shop Pro calls this tool the Background Eraser,
even though it has nothing to do with the Background Material box, as shown
in Chapter 3. Whereas background in every other aspect of Paint Shop Pro
means “The secondary color that’s used to fill the middle of a shape,” here it
means what most people think it does: the stuff behind the interesting things
in a picture. Why they didn’t call it something like the Erase to Edge tool in
order to keep their terminology consistent is beyond us.
Here’s how to do it:
1. Click the Background Eraser tool, as shown in the margin.
2. Change settings on the Tool Options palette if you need to fine-tune
the way the eraser erases (press F4 if you don’t see the palette).
Mostly, the options that Paint Shop Pro picks work pretty darned well,
but sometimes you may need to tweak them. Paint Shop Pro has the usual
array of Brush options — which we get to in a bit — but it also has several
options specific to the Background Eraser. Just in case, here they are:
Sampling
Continuous: The Background Eraser continually checks the image
to discern a difference between the foreground and the back-
ground. This setting generally provides the best results.
Once: The image is checked only once, where you first clicked.
Generally, this setting does very little erasing.
Foreswatch and Backswatch: The Background Eraser attempts to
erase colors that are similar to what is in the Foreground or
Background Material box, respectively. Use this setting if what
you want to erase is one color and the Continuous setting isn’t 
getting it right.
Limits
Contiguous: Paint Shop Pro erases only areas that are within what it
considers to be the background, removing up to the edge of Cousin
Charlie.
Figure 4-5:
If the
mountain
will not
come to
Mohammed,
erase that
sucker!
83
Chapter 4: Painting, Spraying, and Filling

Discontiguous: The tool erases everywhere, so if a little bit of the
wallpaper’s color is on Charlie’s shirt, it may well erase that too.
Find Edge: The tool removes the border between what it considers
the background and the foreground, erasing a thin line between
Charlie and the wallpaper.
Sharpness
Low values produce a fuzzy line between the background and
Cousin Charlie; high values create a crisp, sharp line. (Low values
in the 40s look more natural.)
Auto Tolerance
If you’re familiar with the Magic Wand tool, the Background Eraser
works much the same way. You can clear this check box to set
your tolerance manually; see Chapter 12 for details.
3. Click a section of the area you want erased, and hold the mouse
button down for one second.
In our example, you would want to click that ugly wallpaper. Holding the
button down for a second or two gives Paint Shop Pro time to do the cal-
culations to figure out what wallpaper looks like so that it can erase it.
4. Drag on your image slowly across the edge in question.
Dragging quickly may go too fast for Paint Shop Pro to keep up, and as a
result it may start erasing bits you want to keep. Drag at a slow, sure
pace across the edge.
Using the Background Eraser is great for removing the bits around edges,
but it’s very slow (and not very efficient) at removing large areas. If you’re
trying to erase everything except Cousin Charlie, we suggest that you use the
Background Eraser to clear a “moat” of transparent space around Charlie and
then switch to the regular Eraser tool to mop up the rest of the image.
Controlling Strokes, Sizes, Shapes,
and Spatters: Tool Options
The Painting and Eraser tools can do much more than just create a plain,
boring spot or line. The Tool Options palette in Figure 4-6 is your key to variety,
artistic success, and fame and fortune. The palette works the same — or nearly
the same — for all painting and erasing tools, except for the Warp Brush.
84
Part II: Painting the Picture 

One key role of your Tool Options palette is to show you what your brush
looks like. As Figure 4-6 shows, a preview area in the upper-left corner shows
you the size, fuzziness (hardness), and speckliness (density) of the spot
you make if you clicked your image. The Tool Options palette is so incredibly
useful that it should almost always be open so that you can check your brush
before you paint.
The Tool Options palette (or its title bar, labeled Tool Options) is probably
already floating around somewhere on your PC screen. If you can’t find the
Tool Options palette, follow these steps:
1. Press the F4 key on your keyboard a few times.
The palette appears and disappears. Leave it visible.
2. If Tool Options appears as a floating window and you don’t want it
hovering over your painting, double-click the title bar to dock it.
3. If the Tool Options palette isn’t where you want it (we prefer along
the top), click the vertical double-row of small indented dots shown
in Figure 4-7 and drag it to wherever you want.
Click and drag either of these to open and close panels within the Tool Options palette.
Click and drag here to move the Tool Options palette around.

Chapter 4: Painting, Spraying, and Filling

4. If you don’t see all the options on the Tool Options palette, you may
need to slide the palette open to see everything.
There are three sections of the Tool Options palette; the brush shape
section, the opacity/blend section, and the shape/size/hardness section.
Slide the small, single row of vertical dots and drag them left and right
and up and down, until you can see all of them clearly, as shown in
Figure 4-7.
(Of course, if you can see everything you intend to change, you don’t
have to open everything. Think of the three sections of the Tool Options
palette as a chest of drawers; you can open them all at one time or close
the ones you’re not working on and keep open the ones you need.)
You don’t need to put away the Tool Options palette before working on your
image. Leave it up so that you can make adjustments as you go. Drag it out of
the way, if necessary, like we just showed you.
Not all tools offer all the adjustments we discuss in the next few sections.
Using convenient controls on
the Tool Options palette
You can make adjustments on the Tool Options palette by using the dialog
box gadgets you’re familiar with from other programs. You can click the Size
and other boxes and edit or type a new value or click either of the spin dial
buttons (the pair of up and down arrows) to increase or decrease a value.
Besides the usual ways of adjusting values, Paint Shop Pro has a nifty adjust-
ment feature, as shown in Figure 4-8. Click the tiny down arrow at the far right
edge of the box for any numerical value, such as the Size box. Hold your
mouse button down, and a tiny ruler-like bar appears, with a pointer. Keeping
your mouse button down, drag the pointer left or right to adjust the value
down or up, respectively.
Figure 4-8:
The preview
adjustment
slider.
86
Part II: Painting the Picture 

Figure 4-8 shows the Paint Brush tool window, although all or most of these
same controls exist for the other painting tools. Clicking the far right down
arrow for a given widget opens the adjustment slider that gives you a rough
preview of what your tool will look like.
If you repeatedly use the same tool with the same tool options, you can save
that tool’s settings as a preset. Presets allow you to load a bunch of tool
options in one click as opposed to entering them over and over again. See
Chapter 18 for more details on this timesaver.
Making lines wider or narrower: Size
You most frequently adjust size. One size of tool definitely does not fit all.
Even Phil, Dave’s house painter, uses different sizes of brushes. (What an
artiste!) On the Tool Options palette, adjust the Size value to any value from
1 through 255 (from 1 to 255 pixels).
You can see just how big your tool is at any time by moving your cursor over
the image. Big brushes may need smaller step values (the number in the box
labeled Step) to avoid painting dotted lines.
Shaping clicks, lines, and line ends: Shape
Shape changes the way the painted (or erased) line looks when it ends or
bends. It also lets you stamp a shape by clicking the image, as though you
had a rubber stamp or were spraying paint through a template.
On the Tool Options palette, you have two options: You can go with a generic
round or square brush, some brushes that simulate chalk or watercolor, or
you can even select a variety of strange and unearthly brushes (like cherries,
comets, or fuzzy circles) to paint with, as shown in Figure 4-9.
Figure 4-9:
The round
and square
brushes and
a gallery of
brushes that
don’t exist in
nature!
87
Chapter 4: Painting, Spraying, and Filling

Selecting a round or square brush couldn’t be simpler: Click the round or
square box. If you want something a little more esoteric, however, you can
select a brush tip from the brush tip drop-down menu next to the Presets
menu. You’re presented with a gallery of brushes you can scroll through;
double-click a brush tip to load it.
Some brush tips emulate other brush styles; chalk, for example, or water-
color. Experiment to see which is closest to your media.
Using the various brush tips, you can make your lines look as though you
have drawn them with a calligraphic pen. Figure 4-10 shows, from top to
bottom, the square, round, chalky, and calligraphic brush shapes.
As you make strokes, you see repeated stampings of this shape. The Step con-
trol (which we discuss in the section “Making lines more or less dotty: Step,”
later in this chapter) helps you change the separation between stampings.
Painting with a softer or
harder edge: Hardness
Hardness determines how sharp the edges of your tool are. Maximum hard-
ness (100) gives your tool a sharp edge; lower hardness applies a gradual
fade to the edge. Zero hardness gradually fades the edge all the way to the
center of the brush shape. At low hardness, you may need to decrease the
step to avoid creating a dotted line. Figure 4-11 shows the effect of changing
hardness.
Reduce hardness to minimize jaggies (a staircase effect also called aliasing)
where your line bends.
Making paint thinner or thicker: Opacity
Opacity is how thick (opaque or solid) your paint is. A value of 100 means
that your paint is completely opaque. Reduce opacity to make a more trans-
parent paint. A value of 50, for example, means that an individual spot of
Figure 4-10:
Choose your

shape!
88
Part II: Painting the Picture 

paint (caused by clicking once with your mouse) is 50 percent transparent.
Overlapping spots cause each stroke, or click of the mouse, to add paint and
make the area more opaque. Figure 4-12 shows single spots with decreasing
opacity.
A brush stroke (dragging with your mouse) is more opaque than a single spot
(clicking with your mouse) because strokes are simply repeated, overlapping
spots. If you increase the values of the step variable (which controls spacing
of those spots), you make the stroke more transparent.
For the Eraser tool, opacity refers to how completely you erase. If you use
maximum opacity (100), you erase the line entirely. Use repeated strokes or
clicks with values under 100 to shave the paint thickness and reduce opacity.
Getting speckles of spray: Density
The word density doesn’t accurately describe this adjustment. The words
speckly-ness or speckle-osity are more accurate, but still confusing. Density
works like this: When density is at its maximum (100), you get nice, solid
Figure 4-12:

paint coverage (or eraserage, if you’re using the eraser). At lower settings of
density, you get random speckles, as though you were spattering or spraying.
Figure 4-13 shows the effect of different density settings.
For the Airbrush tool to do its job (which is spraying paint), you must set the
density to less than 100. Yet, you can set density less than 100 for the Paint
Brush or Eraser tools too, and they also give a speckly result, similar to the
results you would get with the Airbrush tool.
Making lines more or less dotty: Step
It’s time you knew the truth: The Paint Shop Pro paint tools don’t apply paint
continuously as you drag. (Gasp!) No, they apply repeated stampings of the
brush’s shape. (Imagine a jackhammer tipped with a rubber stamp.) The Step
control determines the distance between those stampings.
If you set the Step value at its maximum (100, meaning 100 percent), the shapes
don’t overlap; the step is 100 percent of the tool size, so you get a dotted line.
At 50, the shapes overlap halfway, and at 25 they overlap three-quarters (25 is
often a good choice). Figure 4-14 shows increasing step values.
Figure 4-14:
Step values
of 20, 40, 60,

step values,

Part II: Painting the Picture 

Very low Step values use up lots of processor power because the computer
has to draw a new stamp every time the mouse moves. If you’re drawing and
the computer hesitates a moment before it renders the line on the screen,
you may consider raising the Step value 10 or 20 percent.
Each brush tip is simply a particular set of values on the Tool Options palette,
values predetermined by Paint Shop Pro. In other words, each medium speci-
fies particular settings for density, opacity, step, and hardness. Choosing the
Chalk brush tip, for example, simply sets Hardness to 90, Opacity to 80, Step
to 25, and Density to 33 for whatever tool (the Paint Brush tool, for example)
you’re using. Choosing the Marker produces different settings.
Coloring within the Lines
by Using Selection
When you’re using painting tools in Paint Shop Pro and have selected an
area, those painting tools work only within that selection. This feature is
great for keeping you “within the lines” as you paint.
First, select the area you want to paint. (See Chapter 12 to find out how to
make selections.) If you have chosen to use multiple layers in your image,
make sure that you’re on the layer that contains the object you want to paint.
(See Chapter 14 or the Cheat Sheet for help with layers.) Then, choose a
painting tool and paint! Feel free to scribble or spray paint over the edges;
the paint falls only within the selection.
Feathered selections work, too, for blending the edges of your painting
efforts into the rest of the image. Paint Shop Pro applies less paint in the
feathered zone. Feathering expands the marquee to include feathered pixels
outside the selection, however. If the selection has Swiss-cheese-like holes in
it (as the Magic Wand tool selections often do), those holes may now be invis-
ible because the feathered expansion covers them. As you paint, because the
holes are feathered areas, they reappear as fuzzy spots that resist being
painted. If you don’t want that effect, eliminate the holes in your selection
before you apply feathering. See Chapter 12 for help.
Replacing Colors
Here’s your chance to make that purple cow — the one that people always
prefer to see, rather than be. The Color Replacer tool is your companion in
creative cow coloring.
91
Chapter 4: Painting, Spraying, and Filling

Color replacement, like most Paint Shop Pro actions, works on only the active
layer and within any selection you may have made. If you have chosen to use
layers in your image, make sure that you’re working on the correct layer
during the following steps, or else replacement may not work.
Here’s how to put new hue in your moo:
1. Click the Color Replacer from the Color Selection toolset.
Your cursor becomes a brush shape. As with the Paint Brush and other
painting tools, the brush size, shape, and other properties are controlled
by the Tool Options palette. See “Controlling Strokes, Sizes, Shapes, and
Spatters: Tool Options,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Hold down the Ctrl key and right-click in your image on the color you
want to replace.
The Background Material box takes on this color.
3. Again, hold down the Ctrl key and left-click your new, replacement
color, either in the image or in the Available Colors of the Color
palette.
The Foreground Material box takes on this color. Alternatively, you can
use any technique we describe in Chapter 3 to set a new foreground
material, complete with textures and gradients and whatnot.
4. To replace the color in specific areas, drag across those areas. Double-
click anywhere to replace the color everywhere.
Like most tools, the Color Replacer tool’s action is constrained by layers
and selections. If you have used layers in your image, color is replaced
only throughout the active layer. If you have a current selection, replace-
ment happens only within that selection.
The Color Replacer tool replaces a range of colors that are close to the one
you picked to be replaced. Adjust the Tolerance setting on the Tool Options
palette to control closeness. (Press F4 if you don’t see the Tool Options
palette.) The larger the Tolerance setting, the broader the range of colors the
Color Replacer tool replaces. If you’re replacing a single, uniform color, set
the tolerance to zero. If you’re purpling a cow in a photograph, you need to
replace a range of browns (or blacks, or whites, depending on the cow). Set
the tolerance higher in that event; try 25 or so, to start. In short, do this:
 If the Color Replacer tool replaces more than you want, decrease the 
tolerance. Press Ctrl+Z to undo the overenthusiastic replacement, and
then drag or double-click again.
 If the Color Replacer tool doesn’t replace enough, increase tolerance
and then drag or double-click again.
92
Part II: Painting the Picture 

Filling Areas
For flooding an area with nice, even color, nothing beats the Flood Fill tool,
except possibly spilling a glass of red wine on a white sweater. (Fortunately,
unlike the wine spill, you can undo the Flood Fill tool’s actions by pressing
Ctrl+Z.)
Using the Flood Fill tool (not to be confused with Phil, Dave’s painter), as
shown in the margin, you can fill an area with whatever is in the Material
box — although a material can be a simple color, it can also be complex gra-
dients or patterns, allowing you to fill an area with a multicolored gradient or
a tiger-skin rug pattern. Moreover, by adding a texture to your material, you
can give a virtual surface roughness to any area you fill. Chapter 3 describes
how to choose a solid color, gradient, or pattern using the Material box.
Filling a selected area with solid color
The most basic kind of fill you can perform is filling a selected area with a
uniform color (the sort of work that Phil, Dave’s house painter, does). For
example, the sky in your photograph may be gray — perhaps with clouds
and power lines running through it — and you want to make it solid, cloud-
less blue with no power lines.
1. Select the area you want to fill, using any of the selection tools.
For example, click the sky in your picture with the Magic Wand tool. See
Chapter 12 for help with getting exactly the selection you want. The
selection marquee indicates your selected area.
If you have chosen to use layers in your image, you must also select the
layer that contains the portion of the image you want to fill. See Chapter
14 for more help with layers. If you don’t use layers in your image, just
make your selection and move on to Step 2.
2. Click the Flood Fill tool on the Tools toolbar.
Your cursor icon changes to the paint can, the Fill tool icon.
3. Choose a Foreground Material to fill with.
Make sure that the Foreground Material box is set to a solid color.
(Chapter 3 shows you how to undo it if it’s anything else.)
4. Open the Tool Options palette.
If the Tool Options palette isn’t visible on your screen, press the F4 key
on your keyboard to display the palette.
93
Chapter 4: Painting, Spraying, and Filling

5. Make the following choices from the drop-down lists there:
Blend mode: Normal
Match mode: None
Opacity: 100 percent for a fill that nothing shows through, or lower
for a more transparent fill
6. Click your selection in the image.
The color completely fills the selected area (in your chosen layer, if you
use layers). If you choose an opacity lower than 100, the color just tints
the selected area and increases in thickness if you click again.
Figure 4-15 shows the effect of a solid fill in a selection of the sky, using deep
blue to fill the sky uniformly. (The edge of the selection is feathered a bit,
causing the white band to appear along the skyline.)
If you’re modifying a drawing, a solid color may be exactly what you want. In
our photo, however, a solid color doesn’t look natural as sky. Sky is never a
uniform color in real life; it changes in color gradually as it approaches the
horizon. For a more natural look, you need a gradient, or shaded, fill.
Filling with a gradient, pattern, or texture
In real life, you rarely see a uniform color (even if you think you do). Changes in
lighting or the angles at which light strikes an object cause a gradual change
across the object from one color to another, lighter color. The surface of your
desk, for example, is probably a lighter color nearer your source of light.
Figure 4-15:
A solid fill
of the sky. In
this image,
a solid fill

natural.
94
Part II: Painting the Picture 

If you need a realistic shading like that, or if for any other reason you want
colors in an area to make a smooth transition from one color to another, try a
shaded, or gradient fill. Figure 4-16 shows the effect of a gradient fill on the
sky area of the photograph.
For some fills, like filling a rectangle to look like a brick wall or a tree trunk,
use a pattern rather than a solid color. To use gradients or patterns, you must
first set your Foreground Material to be a gradient or pattern; see Chapter 3
for instructions on choosing the gradient or pattern you need.
Or, you may want to apply color with a textured appearance. Just like the
other painting tools, if the Material box has a texture, such as canvas or
asphalt, the Fill tool applies it. Again, refer to Chapter 3 for more details.
Blend modes
Sometimes, you don’t want to overpaint the underlying image; you want to
just tint or infuse the image with a color or increase or decrease color satura-
tion or apply some other quality. The Fill tool has some fancy features, called
blend modes, that combine attributes of your chosen fill, such as hue and 
saturation, with the underlying image in complex and subtle ways. In general,
these blend modes are too obscure to be useful for any except the most dedi-
cated graphics professional. For the rest of us, two of the modes, Color and
Hue, can be occasionally useful because they can infuse an area with color,
although the Colorize command, which we describe in Chapter 9, does that
job quite nicely.
To experiment with blend modes, click the Blend Mode drop-down list on the
Fill tool’s Tool Options palette and choose a mode. Then try filling a selected
area of your image.

Alex, the Saintly Dog
As an example of all this brushing and filling hoo-hah, we have decided that
Dave’s dog Alex is the best-behaved dog in the world. We’re attempting to
convince the Weekly World News tabloid that Alex is such a good dog that he
has a halo. (The Weekly World News may be naïve, but it pays well.) Two
problems show up in the current picture of Alex, shown in Figure 4-17,
though.
One, he has no halo — but we draw that. Two, the Weekly World News uses
only black-and-white photos, and that light slatted background behind Alex
isn’t dark enough to make the halo stand out. We rectify that in eight easy
steps!
If you’re reading ahead in this chapter, you may notice that the doorbell
directly above Alex’s head, as shown in all the other pictures of Alex in
this book, isn’t present here. We got rid of that using the Clone Brush; see
Chapter 5 to find out how to remove unsightly doorbells from your pictures.

Part II: Painting the Picture 
What about tolerance?
Technical types may be wondering what the
Tolerance control, on the Fill tool’s Tool Options
palette, is good for. In this chapter, we bypass
the need to use that control by instructing you
to select the area you want to fill and then use
a Match mode of None. We think that’s the eas-
iest way to fill a specific area.
An alternative to selecting an area beforehand
with a selection tool is to use the Fill tool itself to
determine which pixels are to be filled, accord-
ing to their color or other qualities. Choose a
Match mode other than None, and then set tol-
erance. The Fill tool determines what pixels to
fill based on those settings, exactly as the
Magic Wand tool does to determine what pixels
to select.

1. Select the slatted background behind Alex.
As we discuss earlier in this chapter, in “Coloring within the Lines by
Using Selection,” you want to select the background to make sure that
you don’t accidentally draw over Alex’s head while you’re changing the
slats. See Chapter 12 for help with getting exactly the selection you want.
(For the record, we used the Magic Wand toolset to a Match mode of
Color, a tolerance of 17, a feather of 1, and a large amount of judicious
Shift+clicking to clean up the small patches of unselected areas.)
2. Select the Paint Brush tool from the Brush toolset.
3. Change the Material (as we discuss in Chapter 3), and then do a test
paint along the edges to make sure that the edges look good.
We selected a dark red material for our paint, but we set the opacity for
our Paint Brush to 50 (half-transparent) so that the slatting still appears
through the paint. As you can see in Figure 4-18, our brush strokes have
stopped at the marquee edge of the selection, right above Alex’s
Buddha-like gaze.
If you don’t see the Tool Options palette, press F4.
4. Paint the entire selected area.
You could also use the Fill tool with a Match set to none. The Fill tool is
at its best, though, on fairly even areas that are mostly the same color,
like the sky in the Fill example earlier in this chapter — not areas with
dark vertical streaks through it, like this one. Besides, you’re already
using the Paint Brush tool, so why switch? The final results are just as
good, as shown in Figure 4-19.
5. Deselect the area.
Alex’s halo needs to be big and impressive. So big and impressive, in fact,
that it sticks out of the current selection — and as long as we have the
Figure 4-18:
Alex, close
to the edge.
97
Chapter 4: Painting, Spraying, and Filling

background selected, we can’t paint outside the lines. If you don’t feel
like skipping to Chapter 12, where we tell you how to deselect, you can
either press Ctrl+D or choose Selections➪Select None.
6. Select the Airbrush tool from the Brush toolset.
A halo is supposed to be fuzzy, so we airbrushed it in.
7. Set the Airbrush options on the Tool Options palette and the
Material box.
A halo is supposed to be fuzzy and bright white, so we picked a pure
white color in the Material box — see Chapter 3 for details on that. We
wanted a reasonably small line for our halo, so a size of 11 seemed about
right — and a halo is supposed to be bright, so we cranked up the
Opacity to 100 so that the background didn’t bleed through.
This still doesn’t address the “fuzziness” issue — but the Hardness and
Step settings do. We reduced the Hardness to 0 to provide maximum
fuzziness, and we set the Step to 35 to produce a slightly spottier line.
8. Draw a halo.
Keep a steady hand! Alex’s reputation is at stake (see Figure 4-20).
What’s that, you say? It looks fake? Have you ever seen the Weekly World News?
You may be asking, “Isn’t Alex’s halo a little shaky there? Doesn’t Paint Shop
Pro have a tool for drawing perfect shapes, like circles, squares, and elliptic
halos?” Of course, it does — and we show you how to draw better halos in
Chapter 15.

Part II: Painting the Picture 

Warping Your Picture
After you have your image the way you like it, you may feel the urge to
smoosh parts of it up, or maybe to create a tiny, black hole that sucks part of
the image into the middle, or to create a swirly whirlpool in the middle of it.
The Warp brush allows you to apply all sorts of kooky 1960s psychedelia to
your pictures.
(The authors want you to note how painstakingly we’re avoiding the urge to
make “Warp Brush Ten, Scotty!” jokes. Thank you.)
The Warp Brush tool uses up lots of computer horsepower. If you find that
warping takes too long as your computer struggles to render every skew and
twist, you can lower the Draft mode quality from the Tool Options palette to
Low or Coarse and set the Final Apply Mode setting to Same as draft. The
tradeoff, naturally, is that your warping looks a little jagged.
To “pinwheel” your image chaotically, follow these steps:
1. Select the Warp Brush tool from the Brush toolset.
2. Select one of the following warp modes from the Tool Options palette.
With the exception of Push mode, each of the warp modes works like the
Airbrush tool: If you keep the brush in one place or move it around
slowly while you hold the mouse button down, the image continues to
distort until you finally decide to let up.
• Push: If you have ever finger painted, you understand instinctively
how this tool works; as you move the brush around, everything
else in the image gets dragged around behind it.
• Expand: As the brush moves, the image swells, as though it’s being
tugged up closer to the screen.
• Contract: As the brush moves, the image shrinks, as though it’s
being pulled away from the screen and into a black hole.
• Right Twirl or Left Twirl: These settings create a slow whirlpool
within the image, swirling the image in the direction you have
selected.
• Noise: This setting applies various tools at random, twisting your
image in different directions to create a truly crazed effect.
• Iron: If you have been going a little loony with the other modes,
you can undo them a little at a time with Iron mode. Rub over the
image in Iron mode before you click the Apply button and the
twists slowly unkink.
• Unwarp: Like Iron mode, this mode also undoes the images, but
you have slightly better control. Still, they’re similar.
99
Chapter 4: Painting, Spraying, and Filling

3. Change your options.
The Warp Brush tool has many of the same settings as the Paint and
Airbrush tools — Size, Hardness, and Step — and it has two new ones:
• A higher Strength setting means that the slightest sweep of the Warp
brush deforms the area like it was Michael Jackson’s face; a low
Strength settings means that the brush barely affects the picture.
• Noise is available only for the Noise tool. The higher the setting,
the more it sprinkles the image with random dots, taken from
colors within the brush areas itself, creating a sort of static that
accelerates the warping.
4. Draw.
Hold down the left mouse button and drag, baby! (The right mouse
button does nothing here.)
5. Decide whether you want to keep the image.
If you like the results, click the green Apply check mark in the upper-left
corner of the Tool Options palette and the warping changes are applied —
a part of your image forevermore. (Or, if you switch to another tool that
needs the changes to be applied before it can work, the program asks
whether you want to save the changes.) If you think that it looks like a
Jackson Pollock painting in a blender and want to get rid of it, click the
cancel (X) button.
Nothing is really forevermore as long as you have the Undo function; as with
the rest of Paint Shop Pro, you can always undo your last action by pressing
Ctrl+Z or clicking the Undo Last Command button on the top row.

emember those cartoons where an image would flow, full-blown, off the
tip of a brush? In just a few brush strokes, Daffy Duck would paint an
image of a door on the wall, open the door, and run through it.
With Paint Shop Pro, you can have images flow off the tip of your brush,
just like Daffy does. (You have to figure out on your own how to run through
walls.) Paint Shop Pro offers two ways to paint with pictures that you would
be daffy not to use:
 Clone Brush: The Clone Brush tool simultaneously picks up an image
from one area of an open image while you brush a copy of that image
somewhere else — either within the same image or within another open
image. (It’s a bit like a newfangled version of the pantograph, for all you
antique machinery mavens.)
 Picture Tubes: The Picture Tube tool lays down a series of images, fully
formed. As you stroke, the images are drawn from a collection of images
you choose, such as variously numbered billiard balls, different types of
flowers, or an abstract shape in various orientations.
Why paint with pictures? The Clone Brush tool simplifies lots of jobs. Using
the Clone Brush tool, you can retouch a photo by copying a texture (like
grass) or a background image (like sky) over some offending portion of the
image. No need to worry about tedious color matching or finicky copying and
pasting; the cloned image blends right in. Or, you can simply clone Alex from
this cold, snowy winter and put him in the photo of the beach at Club Med.
(We would have brought him to Club Med with us, but Alex hates flying.)

The Picture Tube tool does a fast job of creating backgrounds of swarm
images — a lawnful of grass, a pile of candies, or a heaping mound of coffee
beans. A few individual images clicked off the Picture Tube can quickly
brighten up a poster, logo, or banner. You can also use the Picture Tube to
create banners and edges — items such as filmstrip edges, a huge Slinky, or
a large snakeskin.
Cloning Alex the Dog
The Clone Brush tool gives you results similar to copying and pasting, but
allows you precise control over exactly what gets copied. This tool is fre-
quently used in photograph retouching to “erase” areas in a picture, replac-
ing them with a neutral background. In certain circumstances, clone brushing
is also easier than copying and pasting.
Suppose that you have determined in the picture of Alex that the green
carpet he’s sitting on just has to go (see Figure 5-1). You had better cover it
up with some snow!
1. Click the Clone Brush tool (as shown in Figure 5-2) on the Tools toolbar.
If you don’t see the Clone Brush tool, you may have selected the
Scratch Remover tool earlier. If that’s the case, click the arrow next to
the Scratch Remover tool and select the Clone Brush tool from the drop-
down menu.
2. If necessary, adjust the size and hardness of the Clone Brush tool on
the Tool Options palette (see Figure 5-3).
Figure 5-1:

Part II: Painting the Picture 

Sometimes you want to have a very large Clone selection to replace
huge areas of a picture — or you want a small selection to make sure
that you can get right in between Alex’s paws. You can adjust the size on
the Size control on the Tool Options palette; large numbers mean that
you copy a large sample of the picture, and smaller numbers mean tiny
samples. You want a teeny selection, so choose 20.
The hardness is a percentage that determines how crisp the edge of a
cloned copy is; 100 percent is a razor-sharp edge, whereas 0 percent is
a fuzzy selection that looks almost blurred and blends easily into the
background (see Figure 5-4). We keep ours at 50 percent.
If you don’t see the Tool Options palette, press F4 on the keyboard.

3. Right-click the source area (the area you want to copy).
Clicking an edge or corner of the object you want helps you with the
next step. In this case, because you want to cover up the green blanket
with a fluffy coating of snow, right-click the snow in the lower-right
corner, as shown in Figure 5-5.
4. Brush (left-click or drag) on the destination area (the area you want 
to paint).
As you brush, keep an eye on the source area too. An X marks the spot
on the source image where the Clone Brush tool is picking up (copying)
pixels. As you move your brush, the X on the source image tracks your
movement. Move so that the X sweeps across the object you want to
copy, as shown in Figure 5-6.
If you ever want to choose another area to clone, all you have to do is
right-click a new section.
If, in Step 3, you right-clicked the upper-left corner of the area you’re copying,
begin painting where you want the upper-left corner of the clone to appear in
Step 4. Stroke down and to the right so that the X traverses the original object.

Part II: Painting the Picture 

Other Clone Brush options
As you have already seen, the size of the area and the hardness can be set on
the Tool Options palette. In fact, using the Tool Options palette, you can set
all the usual variations available to Paint Shop Pro brushes: shape, opacity
(transparency), step, and density (speckliness). You can find more informa-
tion on these settings in Chapter 4.
Cloning versus selection
When you copy individual people or objects, you can either use the Clone
Brush tool or copy and paste. Which to choose? The Clone Brush tool isn’t
really the best tool for copying objects because constraining the tool to just
the object you’re copying is difficult — but sometimes it’s the fastest tool
to use.
Here are three tips to tell you when the Clone Brush is the way to go:
 Use the Clone Brush when you have a large enough background to
clone. If you left-click very near where you originally right-clicked, you
may soon start cloning your clones. (Your X may traverse areas you just
painted.) You don’t lose quality, but a pattern becomes apparent more
quickly. If you look carefully at Figure 5-7, where we have begun to clone
over Alex, you can discern a pattern in the slats we have cloned.

Chapter 5: Painting with Pictures

 Use the Clone Brush to put an object behind something. For example,
you may want Alex to appear behind a palm tree at Club Med. With the
Clone Brush tool, you can paint his image on either side of the palm tree.
Paint Shop Pro has ways of doing this job that give cleaner results, but
the Clone Brush tool is often simpler.
 Use the Clone Brush only when backgrounds are similar. Copying an
object without picking up a few border pixels is difficult using the Clone
Brush tool, so it works best when backgrounds match.
Painting with Picture Tubes
Imagine a paint tube that, rather than containing paint, is crammed with
images that pour out as you squeeze the tube. You now have a good mental
image of the Paint Shop Pro Picture Tube tool. Paint Shop Pro comes with a
gallery of tubes to use.
Each tube contains a set of images on a particular theme. For example, you
can squeeze out a set of airplanes, butterflies, billiard balls, or coins. Each
individual image in a tube is different. Figure 5-8 shows an illustration that
uses two tubes: various blades of grass and many raindrops.
Picture tubes have several purposes. They can serve as
 A source of clip art on various themes
 Brushes for interesting textures and shapes, such as grass, fire, or three-
dimensional tubes
 Creative painting tools that are sensitive to your brush strokes
106
Part II: Painting the Picture 
Cloning between images or layers
The Clone Brush tool copies just as well from
one image window to another window as it
does within one image. It also copies between
layers, if you want.
To clone between images, open both images.
They appear in separate windows in Paint Shop
Pro. Just right-click the source image where you
want to copy, and then left-click or drag where
you want to paint on the destination image.
To clone between layers, select your source
layer on the Layer palette. Then, right-click the
image you want copied. Select the destination
layer on the Layer palette, and then left-click or
drag on the image.

Basic tubing
Picture tubing is fundamentally easy. You choose what kind of pictures you
want and click or drag the picture tube across the image. Here are the details:
1. Click the Picture Tube tool (as shown in the margin) on the toolbar.
You may have to wait when you first choose this tool because Paint Shop
Pro loads its cache with pictures. A Cache Status box may briefly appear.
2. Choose which picture set you want from the Tool Options palette.
A sample image from the selected picture tube appears next to the
Presets menu. Click the down arrow to the right of that sample to reveal
a gallery of picture tubes of different types. Some picture tube pictures
aren’t much to look at individually, like the 3-D items, but they create
cool effects when you drag your brush. Scroll through those images to
review them, and then click the one you want.
3. Click in the image window to deposit one picture at a time or drag to
paint a line of pictures.
As you click or drag, various pictures similar to the sample you chose
appear at intervals on the image. (If the image isn’t much bigger than an
individual picture, few pictures may appear. See “Adjusting basic tube
behavior,” just a bit later in this chapter, for instructions on reducing the
picture size.)
The basic way to use picture tubes is as a sort of randomly chosen clip art
to ornament an illustration. Choose a tube and then click the illustration in
various places to drop in some art. However, other tubes are meant to be
dragged to create a banner, like Filmstrip, Rope, and Neon Pink.

Chapter 5: Painting with Pictures

Adjusting basic tube behavior
If the Picture Tube tool doesn’t deliver images in quite the way you want, you
can change its behavior. Behaviors you can modify include
 Picture size: Reduce the number in the Scale value box if the pictures
are too large. Scale is initially set to 100 (percent), the largest setting.
 Spacing between pictures: Pictures initially flow off the brush at a cer-
tain preset spacing. Increase the step value on the Tool Options palette
to separate pictures. To jam them together, decrease the value.
 Regular or random spacing: The Picture Tube tool is initially set to ran-
domly vary the spacing between pictures as you drag. To make it deliver
an evenly spaced stream of pictures, choose Continuous from the
Placement Mode drop-down menu on the Tool Options palette.
 Picture sequence: The tool is initially set to choose pictures randomly
from its set of images. To have it select images in sequence, choose
Incremental from the Selection Mode drop-down menu on the Tool
Options palette.
The artist who created the tube determined the sequence. For each
stroke you make, the sequence picks up where you last left off. The tube
doesn’t repeat the initial picture until it has delivered the last picture.
108
Part II: Painting the Picture 
Cloning neatly within the lines
You can paint neatly within a precisely defined
area by selecting that area in the destination
image. (We describe selection in Chapter 12.)
Paint Shop Pro paints only within the selection
marquee.
To paint Alex behind a palm tree, for example,
you can select the palm tree’s trunk and then
invert the selection to select everything except
the palm tree. Then your brush stroke can slop
right over the tree without leaving paint on it.
Creating a selection around the source area
doesn’t help you copy from a precise area, how-
ever. A selection works on only the destination
area.

Part III
Improving
Appearances

In this part . . .
T
his part is the place to turn when you have an image
that needs work. If your image has individual defects,
Chapter 6 is the place for you. We show you which Paint
Shop Pro hand tools can help. You can brush away freck-
les or paint speckles, repair scratches, or remove that evil
red glow from the eyes of people or animals caught in a
too-direct ﬂash.
For overall appearance problems in photographs, check
out Chapter 7. Over- or underexposed photos? Green
people? Blurry or speckly images? Dull colors? No prob-
lem. Paint Shop Pro 8 offers several effects speciﬁcally
designed to ﬁx common photo problems — including the
amazing One Step Photo Fix, which can clarify all your
photos with a click.
If your image needs to go beyond not bad and into the
world of wow, Chapter 8 is the place to go. Paint Shop Pro
provides all kinds of stunning and clever special effects.
You can bend, twist, chisel, cut out, or translate an image
into exotic media, like neon or metal. In Chapter 8, we give
you examples to work from.
To get the most from your art, you need to understand
your medium. With Paint Shop Pro, your medium is soft-
ware. When you need to get precise about color, turn to
Chapter 9, where we show you how to talk clearly to Paint
Shop Pro about exactly what you need, whether it’s more
saturation or a color that’s a bit more yellow.
When automatic solutions, like the Paint Shop Pro effects,
don’t quite solve overall image problems, your image may
need ﬁne-tuning with the Paint Shop Pro color commands.
We show you how to clean up subtle problems of contrast,
brightness, and color in Chapter 10.

C
an Paint Shop Pro remove worrisome wrinkles, unwanted warts, or
malevolent moles? Would Uncle Andrew look any less evil without red
eyes? Can you do anything about the scratches and creases in that family
heirloom photo?
The Paint Shop Pro answer to these questions is an emphatic “yes!” (For
trickier tasks, like looking a bit skinnier or restoring lost hair, the Paint Shop
Pro answer is an emphatic “Um . . . well, sort of.” Believe us, we’ve tried.)
In this chapter, we focus on the Paint Shop Pro tools you can direct toward
problem areas. They don’t help you shed pounds or grow hair, but they do
help you improve specific spots on your photograph or illustration:
 Retouch toolset
 Scratch Remover tool
 Red-eye Removal adjustment
If your image has a color depth of fewer than 16.7 million colors, Paint Shop
Pro needs to increase the number of colors in your image before you can use
any of these tools and adjustments; if you’re tired of it always asking you
whether it’s okay to increase the colors, see Chapter 19.

Paint Shop Pro has other, automatic adjustments that can enhance the entire
image or selected areas of it. See Chapter 7 for more information about those.
Adjusting Your Retouch and Hue Strokes
To use any of the retouching or hue tools, open the Tool Options palette; if it
isn’t already open, press F4 on your keyboard.
You want to adjust the size and other stroke attributes of the Retouch and
Hue tools you have chosen to match your task. The specific controls vary
from tool to tool, but they’re pretty much the same as the Paint Shop Pro
brushes. Because we’re running short on space, we refer you to Chapter 4
for the skinny on brush controls.
Using layers? The Retouch and Hue tools, like most of the Paint Shop Pro
tools, normally work on only the selected layer. (If you have selected an
area, it works only within that area, too.) To have the Retouch tool modify
all layers at one time, enable the Sample Merged check box if it’s available.
If the tool doesn’t seem to be working, check to make sure that you have the
correct layer selected (see Chapter 14) and that you don’t have a selection
encompassing some other area (press Ctrl+D to deselect everything).
The Friendly Finger of
the Retouch Toolset
The retoucher’s best friend in Paint Shop Pro is the friendly finger of the
Retouch toolset, as shown in Figure 6-1. The Retouch toolset, which lurks on
the toolbar, is a kind of virtual fingertip with which you can rub away many
defects, like Mom rubbing a bit of soot off your nose.
The Retouch toolset offers many tools to choose from. For many of these
tools, using them well requires a pretty technical insight into computer
graphics. In this chapter, we cover other effects you’re likely to use most.
Softening
One of the most useful Paint Shop Pro effects is great for retouching portraits:
the Soften tool. The Soften tool, well, softens sharp edges — wrinkles, for
instance. Just brush the tool across those edges or click them.
112
Part III: Improving Appearances 

Figure 6-2 shows a frighteningly close shot of the left eye of wrinkled, old
Uncle Dave, a friendly author. On the left is an unretouched copy; on the right
is the Soften tool softening his wrinkles.
You could get the same result by selecting the wrinkled area and applying the
Blur or Blur More Effect, but that’s more work. (See Chapter 7 for help with
adjustments.) If you want a nice, soft angelic glow to your entire image, the
Soft Focus Adjustment (also in Chapter 7) makes everything radiant.

113
Chapter 6: Retouching Touchy Spots

To work more gradually and do less softening in each stroke, set Opacity to a
lower value on the Tool Options palette.
Smudging
The Smudge tool picks up paint from the place where you set it down and
smears that paint as you drag to other areas, making it the closest thing Paint
Shop Pro has to finger painting. As it smears, it loses paint just as your finger
would. You can use smudging to soften edges, rub out pimples, or even blend
in a dot of rouge (in the form of low-opacity red paint) you have added to the
cheek of your CEO’s portrait.
To minimize moles, pimples, and similar imperfections, start not on the dis-
colored area, but rather off to one side. Smudge across the discolored area
and release the mouse button after you’re through the area. Repeat in the
opposite direction, again starting on clear skin.
Figure 6-3 shows the smudge effect as the Retouch tool is dragged from left to
right, starting with white and passing through the center of three differently
colored squares in a single stroke. Notice how the paint fades as the tool
moves from left to right. The tops of the three squares have also been
smudged, but with repeated, circular strokes.

114
Part III: Improving Appearances 

As in the center of Figure 6-3, a single stroke may reveal the inherent dotti-
ness of computer stroking, which you can minimize by reducing the Step
value on the Tool Options palette. Repeated strokes, as along the tops of the
squares in Figure 6-3, tend to smear out those dots.
Other Retouch tools
Not all the Retouch tools are useful; some are obscure, and others are more
creative than restorative. Still, they may be worth a try. The following are
brief synopses of what they do:
 Sharpen: Amplifies edges, wrinkles, and other sudden transitions (the
opposite of Soften).
 Emboss: Creates a grayscale image that appears to be embossed, like
George Washington’s face on a U.S. quarter.
 Push: Picks up the image area where you begin dragging and pushes it
along, leaving a trail of finely overlapping copies of that area. (Overlap is
controlled by the Step value on the Tool Options palette.)
 Dodge: A term taken from photographic darkroom work that means to
lighten areas that are already somewhat light. It lightens the image and
enhances contrast at the same time.
 Burn: The opposite of Dodge; darkens pixels that are already somewhat
dark. It darkens the image while enhancing contrast.
The Color Madness of the Hue Toolset
Although Paint Shop Pro offers a dizzying variety of ways to change colors
and intensities, the Hue toolset, as shown in Figure 6-4, is the easiest. You can
lighten or darken areas of your image, swap colors in a target area, intensify
the colors, or leach them to a dull gray.
Lightening and darkening
You can lighten or darken in lots of different ways in Paint Shop Pro — but
the most basic is the Lighten/Darken tool in the Hue toolset. You’re given two
options here: RGB and Lightness. In most cases, RGB works just fine. Hold
down the left mouse button and drag to lighten an image; hold the right
button and drag to sink it into the shadows.
115
Chapter 6: Retouching Touchy Spots

“Lightness” adjusts the lightness portion — the L in HSL — and RGB adjusts
the red, green, and blue portions. If you really want to know what the differ-
ence is, check out Chapter 10.
The left side of Figure 6-5 shows an image of Dave’s trusty golden retriever,
Alex, that was taken a bit too close to the camera’s flash. On the copy on the
right side, we have right-clicked with the Lighten/Darken tool in RGB mode in
order to tone down the gleam on his nose and reduce the flash’s reflection in
his eyes.

116
Part III: Improving Appearances 

To darken more gradually and gain more control over the results, set the
opacity to a lower value on the Tool Options palette.
The rest of the Hue toolset
Other tools are in the Hue toolset, but they’re not used much:
 Saturation Up/Down: Holding down the left mouse button and dragging
while you have the Saturation tool selected amplifies the inherent colors
in your image; holding down the right button leaches the colors out, ren-
dering it a lifeless gray. (For more information on what Saturation is, see
Chapter 10.)
 Change to Target: You can use the Change to Target tool to transform all
the colors under your brush into shades of the color in the Foreground
Material box. If you’re really feeling comfortable with the whole HSL
thing (as shown in Chapter 10), you can replace the hue, saturation, or
lightness instead.
 Hue Up/Down: This pushes colors counterclockwise (red, yellow, green,
cyan, blue, violet, and magenta) or clockwise on the Paint Shop Pro
color wheel. We don’t know when you would use it, but hey — it came
with the program, right?
The Scratch Remover Tool
Having photos come back from the developer with a scratch is heartbreaking.
Usually, it means that a scratch is on the negative, so making a new print
can’t help. Equally traumatic is having a valued print creased, torn, or
scratched when you don’t have a negative and can’t replace the print. Paint
Shop Pro has an answer for all your folds, creases, and scratches. After you
scan the picture into Paint Shop Pro (refer to Chapter 2), here’s what to do:
1. Zoom in on your scratched area so that it fills the screen.
Select the magnifying-glass icon from the Pan and Zoom toolset and
zoom in; refer to Chapter 1 for details.
2. Click the Scratch Remover tool from the Clone toolset, as shown in
Figure 6-6.
This tool is the trowel-looking icon shown in the margin.
3. Position your mouse cursor at one end of the scratch and drag along
the scratch.
As you drag, a frame area stretches to follow your mouse cursor and
extends across the width of the scratch, as shown in Figure 6-7.
117
Chapter 6: Retouching Touchy Spots

4. Release your mouse button at the end of the scratch.
If you’re following a curved or irregular scratch, release your mouse
button at the point where the curve can no longer fit within the frame.
(Later, you can go back and remove remaining segments of scratch.)
When you release the mouse button, the Scratch Remover tool picks up
paint from either side of the scratch and pushes it into the scratch. If
you had to stop short of the end of the scratch, drag a second time to
cover the remaining portion.

Part III: Improving Appearances 

That’s it! You now have a slightly fuzzy band where the scratch was, but it’s
probably much better than a scratch.
If your photo has lots of small scratches from improper handling, try the
Automatic Small Scratch Removal adjustment we describe in Chapter 7.
If the scratch wasn’t completely filled in, you may need to repeat your action
for another segment of scratch or adjust some tool options and try again. For
irregular scratches, remove the scratch in sections. To adjust options, first
undo any failed attempt (press Ctrl+Z). Next, open the Tool Options palette
(press F4 to toggle the window on or off). Follow one of these methods:
 If the scratch didn’t fill in because the scratch was wider than the tool’s
frame: A value box on the Tool Options palette allows you to adjust the
Scratch Remover’s width in pixels. Increase the value in that box and
again try to remove the scratch. With tool settings larger than 20, the
frame exhibits an inner and outer zone as you drag. As you drag, make
sure that the scratch fits in the inner zone and that the outer zone is com-
pletely filled with the bordering colors you want to use for filling in.
 If you end up with an unacceptably wide, fuzzy band where the
scratch was: The tool’s width was set too high. Lower the width value on
the Tool Options palette.
 If the end points of the scratch didn’t properly fill in: An outline option
gives you an alternative shape to drag, one that has pointed ends rather
than square ones. That shape is good for clicking in tight spaces or cor-
ners. Click that alternative shape button and then try scratch removal
again.
If the scratch runs along an edge in the image, use the smallest width possi-
ble to avoid blurring that edge. For instance, in Figure 6-7, the scratch grazes
Dave’s shoulder, where his shirt ends and the trees begin. The Scratch
Remover blurs that edge. Rather than remove the entire irregular scratch in
one broad attempt, he may do better to remove that shoulder-grazing portion
of the scratch separately, with the width value set very low. If all else fails,
use the Clone tool, as shown in Chapter 5.
The Red-Eye Remover
In our youth, we longed for something to remove the telltale morning red-eye
that bespoke a long, hard night out. Regrettably, Paint Shop Pro doesn’t
remove that kind of red-eye, where the blood vessels in the whites of your
eyes throb reproachingly.
119
Chapter 6: Retouching Touchy Spots

The Paint Shop Pro red-eye remover does, however, fix the evil red glow that
sometimes appears in photographs, emanating from the pupils of the eye as
the result of a camera’s flash. In animals, that glow may not be red, but,
rather, yellow or other colors.
The red-eye remover in Paint Shop Pro is a red-eye replacer. Rather than
attempt to restore the original pupil of the eye, Paint Shop Pro says “The
heck with it” and paints a whole new pupil, complete with the glint of the
flashbulb. In fact, the red-eye remover can even construct a new iris (the 
colored portion of your eye) if the camera’s flash has obliterated it!
Reconstructing the pupil
Usually, red-eye affects only the pupil. If it has affected the iris in your photo,
see the section “Replacing pupil and iris,” later in this chapter. Here’s how to
get rid of red-eye if the flash hasn’t affected the iris area:
1. Choose Adjust➪Red-eye Removal.
The amazingly complex-looking Red-eye Removal dialog box appears.
Figure 6-8 gives you the picture.
2. Zoom in close on one of the red eyes, in the preview windows.
To zoom in, click the button displaying a magnifying glass with a + sign,
located between the two preview windows. Repeat until the eye practi-
cally fills the windows.

120
Part III: Improving Appearances 

To move the photo around behind the window, drag in the right (not left)
window. Your cursor displays a hand icon when it’s over the right window.
If you mistakenly drag or click in the left window, click the Delete Eye
button to remove the replacement iris you have accidentally created.
3. Choose Auto Human Eye (if you’re working on a human) from the
Method selection box.
If you’re working on an animal, choose Auto Animal Eye.
4. Set Iris Size to zero.
Or, if you have changed your mind and decided that the red really does
afflict the iris, see the section “Replacing pupil and iris,” later in this
chapter.
5. Click once on the dead center of the (red) pupil of the eye in the left
window.
A circle appears, with a dot in the center and a square frame surround-
ing the circle. The circle has handles on it (tiny squares you can drag).
Figure 6-8 shows this tool.
You want the circle to just cover the red pupil and be centered over it.
6. Adjust the circle’s position or size if the circle doesn’t cover the red
pupil.
You can drag the circle by the dot in its center. To resize the circle, drag
one of the handles on the box surrounding the circle.
7. Looking at the right window, adjust the Refine control left and right
until the red is just covered by a dark spot (the new pupil).
The Refine control determines to what extent the new pupil covers the
red. When you’re done, little or no red should be showing. For precise
control of Refine, click the slider and press the left- and right-arrow keys
on your keyboard to decrement or increment the slider. The new pupil
should be no larger than the original and shouldn’t cover the eyelid. If
you can’t achieve a result you like, return to Step 5 and resize the circle.
8. Adjust the Pupil lightness value box to set the lightness of your new
pupil to your liking.
Decrease the value for a darker pupil. For a normal appearance, the
pupil should be darker than the iris.
9. Check the new, white glint in the right window against the original in
the left window.
If the new glint isn’t roughly the same size as the original, adjust the
Glint size control up or down until they match. Feel free, however, to
make the new glint any size you like, including removing it altogether by
121
Chapter 6: Retouching Touchy Spots

setting the glint size to zero. If you prefer the glint in the center of the
eye, click to enable the Center Glint check box. Otherwise, the glint
tracks the original one. Adjust the Glint Lightness control up or down to
match the brightness of the original glint. If the new glint has a notice-
ably sharper edge than the old, adjust the Blur control upward.
10. Increase the Feather control to get a softer edge or to mute any
remaining red spots around the edge.
Alternatively, if the original photo is a bit blurry, try adjusting the Blur
control upward instead. Fool around with these two controls until the
edges look properly blended into the rest of the eye.
11. Click the Proof button (with the eye icon) to check your results in the
main image window.
(Drag the Red-eye Removal dialog box out of the way, if necessary; don’t
close it yet.)
Return to any earlier steps that seem necessary to adjust size, darkness,
coverage, glint, and so forth.
If you decide that you need to give up and start again, click the Delete Eye
button. If you want to return all the settings to their original positions,
click the Reset button in the upper-right corner.
If you can’t get acceptable coverage of the pupil, click the Cancel button
and see the following section.
12. Click OK.
When you’re done with one eye, repeat those steps for the other eye. When
you proof your work in Step 11, make sure that the eyes match!
Outlining problem pupils
As you undoubtedly remember from school, some pupils are troublemakers.
They don’t cooperate if you try to doctor their red-eye. In that case, change
from using automatic red-eye removal to manual outlining.
Open the Red-eye Removal dialog box and zoom in as directed in Steps 1 and 2
in the preceding section. Rather than choose Auto Human (or Auto Animal)
Eye in Step 3, which tells Paint Shop Pro to automatically outline the red area,
choose one of these two manual outlining options:
 Freehand Pupil Outline: Choose this option if you prefer to drag a con-
tinuous line around the red area to outline it. (This technique requires a
steady hand, but can give a more rounded outline.) When you release the
mouse button, Paint Shop Pro connects the line’s end with its beginning.
122
Part III: Improving Appearances 

 Point-to-Point Pupil Outline: Choose this option if you prefer to click a
series of points around the red area. Paint Shop Pro draws a straight line
between the points. When you’re ready to complete the circle, don’t
click the starting point again. Instead, double-click somewhere short
of that point. Paint Shop Pro completes the circle for you.
Drag or click an outline, according to your choice of options. After you outline
the pupil, resume with Step 7 in the steps in the preceding section to refine the
red-eye correction.
Replacing pupil and iris
If the flash has affected the colored iris of the eye, first follow Steps 1 through 4
in the steps under “Reconstructing the pupil,” earlier in this chapter. (In those
steps, you open the Red-eye Removal dialog box, zoom in on an eye, and click
in its center.)
Then, after Step 3, follow these steps:
1. Enlarge the circle in the left window to cover an area equal to the iris
(not just the pupil) you need.
Drag any corner handle of the square frame surrounding the circle to
enlarge the circle. Often, the circle needs to overlap the top eyelid and
possibly a bit of the bottom.
2. Adjust the value in the Iris Size value box up or down, a little at a
time, until the iris and pupil size either matches the other eye or
simply looks correct.
Click the tiny up arrow or down arrow adjoining the Iris Size value box
to change the value by one.
3. Click the Hue selection box and choose an iris color from the list.
Choose from Aqua, Blue, Brown, Gray, Green, or Violet.
4. Click the down arrow to the right of the Color sample box and choose
a precise shade of color from the gallery that appears.
5. Adjust the Refine control left or right to set the shape and extent of
the iris.
The optimal setting of the Refine control occurs when the iris doesn’t sig-
nificantly overlap an eyelid and is reasonably round elsewhere. A black
spot with a white glint should cover the pupil of the eye.
Resume with Step 8 in the “Reconstructing the pupil.” From here, you adjust
the darkness of the pupil, set any feathering or blurring you need, and adjust
the glint size, if necessary.

ith today’s point-and-shoot cameras, you may wonder whether any-
thing could really go wrong with your photos. They autofocus, auto-
expose, autoadvance, autoflash, and, therefore, autobedarnednearperfect.
But despite all this automation, we all still make seriously flawed photographs
from time to time — or have to scan in scratched photos from the dark days
when people still used flash cubes. Maybe we autogiveup?
Fear not, fellow photo flubbers! If your photos get an F for Faulty, you can find
a flock of effects for finessing your photos to a fare-thee-well. Even for people
whose pictures are practically perfect, Paint Shop Pro is replete with photo-
polishing possibilities. Now, if only they had an answer for authors’ 
unlicensed alliteration.
A common problem with scanned photos is that they’re a little off-kilter, like
a picture hung wrong. Paint Shop Pro offers a handy straightening feature to
put your photos back on the level — but because that’s usually a scanning
problem, we cover that in Chapter 2.
Adjustments in Paint Shop Pro are used to enhance photographs and images
of all kinds. (The program also has effects, described in Chapter 8, which
apply all sorts of artsy effects to your image.)

Like most other features of Paint Shop Pro, effects work only on whatever
layer of an image is active, and within a current selection. If your image has
multiple layers, you need to choose the layer you want before applying an
effect. See Chapter 14 for help with layers.
If your image has a color depth of less than 16.7 million colors, Paint Shop
Pro asks whether you want to increase the number of colors in your image
first. Considering that these adjustments don’t work unless you answer Yes,
this question is sort of silly. If you get tired of continually clicking OK to no-
brainer questions like this, see Chapter 19.
The One Step Photo Fix
Paint Shop Pro offers a special selection that allows you to run all the most
commonly used photo enhancements in a single click! Much like baking store-
bought chocolate chip cookie dough, the One Step Photo Fix isn’t quite as
good as doing it by hand — it tends to err on the light side, giving slightly
washed-out photos — but if you’re pressed for time, it can be a lifesaver.
In the Photo toolbar up top, you see a drop-down menu that says Enhance
Photo; select it and choose One Step Photo Fix. (If for some reason you don’t
see it, choose View➪Toolbars➪Photo.) Paint Shop Pro then adjusts the color,
sharpens the sucker, fixes the contrast, and washes your windows and tops
off your gas tank while it’s at it. (You still need to correct any red-eye and
remove any scratches by hand.)
If you don’t like the results of the Photo Fix, read on! Sometimes you just have
to roll up your sleeves and get a little dirty to create the vibrant picture that
your friends deserve to see.
Using the Adjustment Dialog Boxes
Many adjustment dialog boxes on the Paint Shop Pro Effects (and Colors)
menu have similar adjustment, preview, and proofing features. The Automatic
Color Balance dialog box provides an example in Figure 7-1.
Adjustments are made using three types of control:
 Sliders: You make many adjustments by dragging sliders. Dragging
varies an associated value (number) that appears in a text box near
each slider.
126
Part III: Improving Appearances 

 Slider values: Rather than drag the slider, you may click in its associated
text box and type a value. This action gives you more precise control than
dragging the slider.
 Value boxes: Value boxes in Paint Shop Pro (like the Strength box shown
in Figure 7-1) are just like value boxes anywhere, but with an additional
feature. You can type a value, or increment or decrement the value by
clicking the up and down arrows that appear in a pair to the right of the
box. You can also adjust the value by clicking and holding the down
arrow to the right of the increment buttons and then dragging left or
right the slider that appears.
All the dialog boxes let you see the effect of your adjustments (preview them
or proof them) before you commit to them. Here’s how to preview or proof
your changes by using the row of buttons underneath the images:
 Zoom: To zoom in or out in the preview windows, click the Zoom In
button (a magnifier with a +) or Zoom Out button (with a –); refer to
Figure 7-1.
 Drag: To move an image behind the preview windows, drag the image
within a preview window. In almost all dialog boxes, you can drag in
either window, although some of them use the left window for defining
areas of interest. Get in the habit of dragging in the right window.

 Navigate: To move quickly to a new area of the image, click the Navigate
button shown in Figure 7-1 and hold the mouse button down for a
moment. A small version of the entire image is displayed, with a rectan-
gle representing your preview area. Drag the rectangle to the area you
want to preview and then release the mouse button.
 Proof: To see the effect of your adjustments in the main image window,
known as proofing, click the Proof button. (The changes you see aren’t
permanent until you click the OK button.) Click the Proof button again
to remove the change.
 Auto Proof: If you would prefer to always proof your adjustments rather
than just see them in the preview windows, click the Auto Proof button.
Paint Shop Pro now shows the effect of your changes in the main image
window every time you make a change. For large images or older com-
puters, however, you may find this proofing method slow. Turn off auto
proofing by clicking the button again.
 Randomize Parameters: If you’re feeling lucky, click the die; Paint Shop
Pro chooses settings at random for you.
After you make an adjustment, click OK to apply it to your image.
Changes are rarely final in Paint Shop Pro because you can undo them by
clicking the Undo button on the toolbar, pressing Ctrl+Z, or choosing the
Edit➪Command History command (refer to Chapter 1).
If you use a certain adjustment often, you can save its settings as presets; see
Chapter 18 for more details on this timesaver.
If you’re not sure which photographic adjustment will make your picture look
the way you want, the Effect Browser gives you a gallery of different versions
of your photo, showing you how it looks under the effect of each of the vari-
ous adjustments. See the section in Chapter 8 about trying on browsing effects
for more details.
Correcting Lighting Color
Despite automatic flashes, lighting is still one of the prime photographic
problems. Your flash fails to go off, the room is lit by incandescent or fluores-
cent light, the sunset casts an orange light, the forest reflects green, or the
swimming pool reflects blue. Many of these problems go away almost magi-
cally with the Paint Shop Pro Automatic Color Balance effect.
Choose Adjust➪Color Balance➪Automatic Color Balance. The Automatic
Color Balance dialog box makes the scene (refer to Figure 7-1).
128
Part III: Improving Appearances 

Adjust the slider left or right in the grandiosely named Illuminant Temperature
area, or edit the value in the Temperature text box. Dragging the slider left
(lower Temperature value) makes the color of your photo visually warmer,
or more orange. (Yes, lower Temperature makes color warmer.) Dragging right
makes the color visually cooler, or bluer. Notice that the Temperature scale is
labeled with various light sources, such as Sunlight; position the slider at a
given label to simulate that light source.
Adjust the Strength value higher for greater effect — generally, a brighter pic-
ture. Adjust it down for the opposite effect.
You want to check the Remove color cast box when a picture is predomi-
nantly one color — for example, Dave’s wife is mostly blue. Paint Shop Pro
then analyzes the image to try to find what the dominant color is and then
attempts to mute that color to bring out the other hues.
See the color section of this book for a color version of Figure 7-1, in which
the Automatic Color Balance adjustment salvages a rather blue picture of
Dave’s wife. That photo was accidentally taken indoors without a flash.
The Temperature thing is about the illumination term color temperature, refer-
ring to the temperature of an incandescent light source. A lower-temperature
light source generally gives a warmer (more orange) light. You can see the
effect in a fireplace or barbecue; as the fire dies down, it gives off a more
orange glow.
Correcting Contrast and Brightness
Paint Shop Pro offers several ways to adjust contrast (see Chapter 10 for
additional ways), but for photos the Automatic Contrast Enhancement effect
is a great place to start. It simultaneously fiddles with brightness and con-
trast — two interlinked attributes — to optimize your photo’s appearance.
Whether your photo has too little contrast or too much, this tool can help.
Choose Adjust➪Brightness and Contrast➪Automatic Contrast Enhancement
and the Automatic Contrast Enhancement control of Figure 7-2 rushes to your
aid. It has three control areas: Bias (or lightness), Strength (amount of effect),
and Appearance (amount of contrast).
In the figure, a photo we took of a cardinal (through a window) suffers from
poor contrast — a dark fate for such a bright bird. The Automatic Contrast
Enhancement effect restores his outstanding appearance. Use the controls of
this effect in the following ways:
129
Chapter 7: Finessing Photos with Adjustments

 If your photo needs contrast adjustment, use the Appearance controls. If
your photo needs more contrast, click Bold; for less contrast, click Flat;
and, if it’s just right, click Natural.
 If your photo needs lightening or darkening, use the Bias controls. If it’s
overall too dark, click Lighter; if it’s too light, click Darker; if it’s just
right, click Neutral.
 For a greater effect on contrast and brightness, click Normal in the
Strength area. Otherwise, choose Mild.
Intensifying (or Dulling) Colors
The more common problem with photos is dull colors that need more inten-
sity. However, if you’re shooting Ronald McDonald, for example, at a sunny
tulip festival, we can imagine that you may need duller colors, too. Either
way, the Automatic Saturation Enhancement effect fills the bill.
Choose Adjust➪Hue and Saturation➪Automatic Saturation Enhancement to
enter the land of more intense (or dimmer) colors. The Automatic Saturation
Enhancement dialog box glimmers onto your screen.
Figure 7-3 shows the dialog box in action. Showing you intensified colors in
a black-and-white illustration is a bit too much of a challenge, however, so
please turn to the color section of this book to see what kind of results you
can achieve.
Figure 7-2:
The

130
Part III: Improving Appearances 

Controls in the Bias area determine whether you intensify or dull your colors.
Choose Less Colorful to dull your colors or More Colorful to intensify colors.
Normal may intensify or dull your colors, depending on how intense they are
now.
Controls in the Strength area determine to what degree you dull or intensify
colors (according to your choice in the Bias area). Choose Weak to barely
affect colors, Normal to moderately affect them, or Strong to have the most
effect.
If you have people in your image, the Automatic Saturation Enhancement
may brighten their faces by mistake, amplifying a healthy pink into a drunk-
ard’s blush. Or, it may dampen a vibrant brown into a sallow gray. If you have
people in your picture, check the Skintones present check box to warn Paint
Shop Pro to leave those pinks and browns alone!
Removing JPEG, Moiré,
and Other Patterns
Unwanted patterns, or other disturbances, are common in images created or
stored in certain ways. Paint Shop Pro offers several effects to help you rid
your images of these imperfections.

Chapter 7: Finessing Photos with Adjustments

Unearthing JPEG artifacts
When photos are stored in JPEG format, as they often are, the result is nice,
small files. But JPEGs that have been compressed to save space often exhibit
strange patterns and checkerboard patterns around text and other objects
with sharp edges. Figure 7-4 shows those patterns, also called artifacts.
To clean up JPEG images, choose the Adjust➪Add/Remove Noise➪
JPEG Artifact Removal option. The JPEG Artifact Removal expert appears
on your doorstep in the form of the dialog box shown in the figure.
Checking your image by either looking in the right preview window or proofing
your choice, choose the strength (Low, Normal, High, or Maximum) needed
to clean up your artifacts. Another casualty in JPEG files is a certain amount
of detail, which you can restore by increasing the value in the Crispness
value box.
Don’t want no moiré
Scanned-in photos from print media (books, magazines, newsletters, PC-
printed images) often have moiré patterns. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more infor-
mation about moiré and ways to avoid it in the first place.)
Figure 7-4:

132
Part III: Improving Appearances 

You can fix moiré patterns by choosing Adjust➪Noise➪
Moiré Pattern Removal. The rather simple Moire Pattern Removal 
dialog box arrives to do your bidding.
The Moire Pattern Removal dialog box offers two controls: Fine Details and
Remove Bands. Adjusting Fine Details upward (sliding it to the right) blurs
your image, removing fine, grainy moiré patterning. Adjusting Remove Bands
upward counters the distracting bands that often are part of moiré patterning.
Unlacing your interlacing
Images captured from videocameras are often interlaced. The image is made
up of horizontal lines created in two passes: The first pass fills in the odd-
numbered lines, and the second fills in the even-numbered lines. Because
the two passes occur at slightly different times, the result is often a motion-
induced blur. The Paint Shop Pro answer to interlacing problems is the
straightforward Deinterlace effect.
Choose Adjust➪Add/Remove Noise➪Deinterlace. The Deinterlace dialog box
appears. It has one control named Scanlines To Retain. Choose which set of
lines you like by clicking either Odd or Even. Paint Shop Pro fills in the elimi-
nated lines by averaging between the lines you retain.
Rubbing Out Scratchiness
Some photos or their negatives can get pretty seriously abused, picking up tiny
scratches, pits, or other imperfections while being handled, while living in suit-
cases or sandy beach bags, or while being badly processed. Hey, who wouldn’t
get a little abraded under those circumstances? To fix individual scratches,
creases, or folds, see the Scratch Remover tool in Chapter 6. To get rid of lots
of scratches at one time, try the Automatic Small Scratch Removal effect.
Choose Adjust➪Add/Remove Noise➪Automatic Small Scratch Removal. The
Automatic Small Scratch Removal dialog box scratches its way onto your
screen.
First, determine whether your scratches are light or dark or both. Next,
select Remove Light Scratches, Remove Dark Scratches, or both. If the pre-
view image on the right side isn’t already adequately cleaned up, change the
Strength setting from Normal to Aggressive. If the effect is removing things
that aren’t scratches or making your photo too fuzzy, try changing Strength
to Mild. (A necessary side effect of cleaning up scratches with this effect is a
133
Chapter 7: Finessing Photos with Adjustments

bit of added fuzziness, so you can’t be too picky.) If the effect is removing
too many tiny features, try adjusting the Local Contrast Limits. To restore 
low-contrast features, drag the pointer at the left end of the line to the right.
To restore high-contrast features, drag the pointer at the right end of the line
to the left.
If the result is still too fuzzy, check out “Removing Noise (Speckles),” later in
this chapter, for alternative methods like the Salt-and-Pepper filter.
Bringing into Soft Focus
Directors learned long ago that smearing the lens with Vaseline produced a
soft, gentle look that gives everything a faint glow and makes the leading lady
look angelic. (Not coincidentally, it also hid wrinkles on aging marquee stars
like Doris Day.) If you want to put the romance back in your photos, you too
can simulate this effect!
Choose Adjust➪Softness➪Soft Focus to bring up the Soft Focus controls, as
shown in Figure 7-5, which allow you to smear all the virtual Vaseline you want:
 Softness: This option controls how blurry you want your image, much
like defocusing a camera. Slide it to the right to give it that total I-forgot-
my-glasses look.

134
Part III: Improving Appearances 

 Edge Importance: Blurring the image may cause faces to turn into
peachlike, fuzzy mushes; sliding this control to the right attempts to
keep the edges (and eyes) distinct. It also helps to produce halos that
surround objects, as opposed to a more general haze.
 Halo Amount: You can produce halos that lend an angelic look to the
items in your image. Slide this control to the right for halo effects that
surround just about everything, or yank it all the way to the left to turn
off haloing altogether.
 Halo Size: Sliding this control to the right creates large, wide bands of
halos, and moving it left produces tighter, “borderlike” halos.
 Halo Visibility: To create halos of pure white light, drag this control to
100 percent; for softer, more background-colored halos, pull it leftward.
Correcting for a Specific Color
Sometimes you don’t know exactly what’s wrong with the color of a photo.
You may, however, know that the color of a specific object in the photo is
wrong. For instance, skin color may be too blue in those underwater shots, or
your cat is simply not that shade of brown. Would you recognize the correct
color of that skin or cat if you saw it? If so, you have an easy way to correct
the color of your photo: the Paint Shop Pro Manual Color Correction effect.
Note that Manual Color Correction adjusts the color of the entire image so
that your selected object (skin or fur, for example) is then the correct color.
It presumes that every object in your photograph was shot in the same, bad
light. If it gets your selected portion of the image correct, the entire image is
then correct. You can use it to correct just the object itself, but you must first
select that object using the Paint Shop Pro selection tools.
Ready? Choose Adjust➪Color Balance➪Manual Color Correction to give
this targeted tool its instructions. The Manual Color Correction dialog box
appears, as shown in Figure 7-6. (Refer to the color section of this book to see
the difference in colors.)
1. Click the Preset Colors radio button and choose a likely-sounding cat-
egory from the menu that matches some portion of your object, like
Skintones or Hair.
2. Click and drag in the left preview window to select a small swatch in
your image that matches the menu selection.
In this case, we have selected Skintones and have selected a tiny box of
skin on Katy’s cheek. We could also have selected Hair and selected her
bangs, if we had wanted.
135
Chapter 7: Finessing Photos with Adjustments

Drag diagonally to define a rectangular area. For instance, drag across
the forehead of your subject, creating a rectangle that surrounds a fairly
uniform skin color, if you intend to match the person’s skin tone to a
color. Choose an area that isn’t strongly affected by highlights or shad-
ows. Drag again if you want to change your selection.
If the area you want to define is irregular in shape, enable the Freehand
Selection check box. Then, drag (draw) the irregular shape you want to
use on the left window.
Use the zoom, drag, and locating features of the dialog box (see “Using
the Adjustment Dialog Boxes,” earlier in this chapter) to get to the right
place in the left preview window, if need be.
3. Click the down arrow to the right of the Preset Colors box.
A gallery of color appears.
4. Choose a color from the gallery that is what that swatch should look
like.
If you can’t find the color you want, click the Manual button and then
click in the Target box to choose a color from the Paint Shop Pro Color
dialog box. Refer to Chapter 3 for the details of using this dialog box.
Paint Shop Pro then alters the image in the right preview window, matching
the hue of your selected area to the hue of the color you chose in Step 4.

Part III: Improving Appearances 

“But,” you may say, “the color doesn’t match exactly.” Don’t panic. Unless
you have previously fiddled with the check boxes in the Options section of
the Manual Color Correction dialog box, the color shouldn’t match exactly —
yet. The Preserve Lightness and Preserve Saturation check boxes, which are
initially selected, cause your photo’s color to be corrected only to the hue (a
kind of fundamental color) of the color you have selected, and not to its satu-
ration or lightness. (See Chapter 9 for more information about hue, satura-
tion, and lightness.) If you want to make the color match your chosen sample
exactly, you must clear both check boxes. However, you may find that you get
good results more easily by leaving both check boxes selected and choosing
different colors.
Sharpening, Edge Enhancing, or Blurring
Many photos need sharpening — well, many of ours do, anyway. Not many
need blurring. Blurring is more of an artistic effect (like those we cover in
Chapter 8) than it is a photo-enhancing effect but, because it’s conceptually
the opposite of sharpening, we discuss it here.
You can apply any of these effects repeatedly to increase their effect. Too
much sharpening, however, can turn your image into a messy field of high-
contrast dots. Too much blurring can turn it into a smeary mess.
Sharpening
Paint Shop Pro offers three sharpening adjustments. Choose Adjust➪
Sharpness and then choose one of the following options from the menu
that appears:
 Sharpen: Does a little bit of metaphorical grinding and filing on the vari-
ous edges of your photo, boosting the contrast at those edges. No dialog
box appears — your image simply gets sharper.
 Sharpen More: The same as Sharpen, but more so.
 Unsharp Mask: Sharpens like its two siblings (Sharpen and Sharpen
More), but operates incognito, like the Lone Ranger. No, just kidding. It
wears not a mask, but rather an adjustment dialog box. To use this box’s
controls, refer to Chapter 2, where we discuss unsharp masking when
setting contrast and other adjustments in scanning software.
Technically, if your picture is taken out of focus, none of these effects can
make it sharp. These effects can, however, give the illusion of doing so in
some cases. The detail it restores is fake — but it’s a good fake.
137
Chapter 7: Finessing Photos with Adjustments

Edge enhancing
The Paint Shop Pro Enhance Edge effect is a close cousin to its sharpening
effect. Both find adjoining pixels that contrast in lightness (an edge) and then
make the contrast stronger by darkening or lightening those pixels. The pixels
gradually move toward fully saturated primary colors, plus white and black.
Choose Effects➪Edge Effects➪Enhance or its more powerful sibling, Enhance
More. Neither uses an adjustment box, but just immediately does its thing.
How do sharpening and edge enhancing compare? The Enhance effect is more
dramatic, focusing directly on even the tiniest edge. The Sharpen adjustment
makes a subtler change that influences a range of pixels around the edge.
Blurring
Blurring effects, although many and varied, are simple to use. Choose
Adjust➪Blur to access these menu items:
 Average: Pops up an adjustment dialog box with a single control,
Amount of Correction. Drag right for more blur.
 Blur: Applies a moderate amount of blurring. No adjustment dialog box
appears.
 Blur More: Like Blur, only more so.
 Gaussian Blur: Pops up a single-control adjustment dialog box. Drag
the Radius control to the right for more blurring or left for less. To the
trained eye of the blur aficionado, this blur is a bit more refined than
Average blur. To the rest of us, it’s just a blur.
 Motion Blur: This effect is an artistic one that most people can under-
stand, having tried to take a photo of a fast-moving child, car, or animal
and ended up with a motion blur. This effect, using an adjustment dialog
box, produces a motion blur! Drag the clock-hand-like Direction control
in that box to point in the direction you want motion. Then set the
Strength slider, moving it to the right if you need more blur (see the 
following Tip paragraph).
Blur is often most effective when applied selectively to a particular area
of your image. Select an area with any of the selection tools we discuss in
Chapter 12 and then apply the blur effect. Blur applied selectively can help
focus attention on the subject of your photo, and away from a confusing
background.
138
Part III: Improving Appearances 

The Motion Blur effect is sometimes best applied to the background area
around the object you want to appear speedy, so the object of interest isn’t
blurred. It’s a great way, for instance, to make Speedy, your lethargic retriever,
appear to live up to his name. Take a photo of Speedy in his fastest pose —
moseying toward his dinner bowl, for example. In Paint Shop Pro, select the
area around Speedy before choosing the Motion Blur effect. Apply the motion
blur in the head-to-tail direction. Your photo looks like your camera tracked
Speedy as he sped heroically to save his Gravy Train from a watery demise.
Figure 7-7 shows this effect applied to Alex, with a slight feathering to make
him blend into the blurred background better.
Removing Noise(Speckles)
Removing noise from an image sounds a bit illogical, like subtracting apples
from oranges or removing odor from a TV program. Okay, you can perhaps
imagine ways to do the latter, but apply that same imagination to how your TV
looks when you run a vacuum cleaner: The screen is covered with speckles.
That’s graphical noise: pixels altered at random locations and in random colors.
The trick with removing speckles is to avoid removing freckles — and other
speckly stuff that’s supposed to be in the picture. (Unless, of course, you
want to get rid of the freckles!) For that reason, Paint Shop Pro offers several
choices, depending on what you need. Choose Adjust➪Add/Remove Noise
and then one of these menu selections:
 Despeckle: Removes smaller, isolated speckles altogether. Good for
removing a light coating of dust. Speckles that are closer to each other
tend to form clumps, however.
 Edge-Preserving Smooth: Gives an effect like rubbing carefully within
the shaded areas of a pastel drawing, using your finger. Speckles disap-
pear into a uniform shade, and you keep the sharp edges of those larger
Figure 7-7:
Speedy
Alex.
139
Chapter 7: Finessing Photos with Adjustments

areas. This effect is also good for removing the random discoloration of
pixels that often results from shooting digital photos in low light. In the
adjustment dialog box that appears, drag the Number of Steps slider to
the right to make a smoother image.
Edge-Preserving Smooth, turned up high, creates a nice oil-painting-like
effect on photos! See Figure C-11 in the color insert in this book.
 Median Filter: Removes speckles by removing fine detail, a kind of blur-
ring process in which each pixel is recalculated to be the average of its
neighbors. Contrast is lost at the detail level. An adjustment dialog box
appears in which you drag the Amount of Correction slider to the right
to remove increasingly large details.
 Salt-and-Pepper Filter: Removes speckles of a particular size (or up to a
particular size) you choose. A Salt-and-Pepper Filter adjustment dialog
box appears, with these adjustments:
Speck Size: Adjust this value to match or slightly exceed the size
of the speckles you’re trying to get rid of. (You may have to zoom
in close to figure out how big your speckles are.)
Sensitivity to Specks: If the right preview window shows clusters
of specks remaining, increase this value. Too high a value blurs
your photo.
Include All Lower Speck Sizes: Enable this check box to remove
specks of Speck Size and smaller. Otherwise, you just remove
specks close to Speck Size.
Aggressive Action: Enable this check box to remove specks more
completely. Otherwise, you may simply reduce the specks’ intensity.
 Texture-Preserving Smooth: This effect sounds like a sophisticated grade
of peanut butter. Actually, it blurs and reduces the contrast of tiny specks
while preserving the larger variations that give texture to grass, wood,
water, and the like. The result is sort of like a crunchy peanut butter with-
out small, gritty chunks. An adjustment dialog box appears in which you
adjust the Amount of Correction value upward to minimize specks.
 Add Noise: Why would you want to add noise? If you’re trying to make a
photo look older or give it a rusty patina or an overlay of static, you can
seed your image with random pixels. Drag the slider to the right to
obscure your image in a haze of dots. There are three Add Noise selec-
tions, each of which deals with color placement:
Random: The noise colors are — surprise! — chosen at random
from the available color palette. If you have a black-and-white image,
don’t expect to see red pixels, although you could see garish orange
and purple pixels in a mostly green picture.
140
Part III: Improving Appearances 

Uniform: The noise colors are all chosen from within the image
itself, making this option perfect for “olderizing” a picture.
Gaussian: Choose this option for a more static-like effect.
You can always select an area using the Paint Shop Pro selection tools, in
order to add or remove noise from only that specific area (see Chapter 12).

P
aint Shop Pro has enough wild and crazy effects to satisfy the most
avant garde artistes (psycho art geeks). The Effects menu in Paint Shop
Pro 8 hides more than 70 different effects that you can consider creative. Jasc
undoubtedly has even more coming down the pipeline. These gadgets are great
fun and incredible timesavers when you need a striking effect in a hurry.
Many of these effects use adjustment dialog boxes, which all have a set of
common controls for zooming, previewing, proofing, and other functions.
Refer to Chapter 7 for help using these controls. We don’t repeat those
instructions here.
Paint Shop Pro categorizes its creative effects into these ten major categories:
 3D Effects: For turning selected areas into raised buttons or cutouts,
dropping shadows, or doing anything else that looks like it’s raised
above or dropped below the page.
 Art Media Effects: For simulating physical art media, like pencil, 
colored chalk, and paint brushing.
 Artistic Effects: For changing your picture into another medium entirely,
like a big neon glow, a topographical map, or a tinfoil stamp.

 Distortion Effects: For warping the surface of your image, by sending
gentle ripples across the top of it, making it look like you’re looking at it
through a big lens, or pixelating parts of it just like they do whenever
someone is exposing too much flesh on Cops.
 Edge Effects: For finding the edges within a picture and bringing them
into focus or softening those edges into a fine Silly Putty-ish blur.
 Geometric Effects: For wrapping or distorting the image as a whole. In
Distortion Effects, you change the surface, but the picture stays the
same size and shape; in Geometric Effects, you can wrap your picture
around a can, or stre-e-e-e-tch it like it was a big rubber band.
 Illumination Effects: For introducing a sunburst or placing one or more
spotlights on parts of the image.
 Image Effects: A catchall category for creating tiles, moving images
slightly, or creating a page-curl effect.
 Reflection Effects: For holding a mirror — or several mirrors — up to
your fabulous image, creating a simple reverse image or a funhouse
array of reflections.
 Texture Effects: For giving your image the effect of being laid on different
surfaces, like crinkled paper or leather, or seen through mosaic glass.
Effects, like most other features of Paint Shop Pro, work on whatever layer of
a multilayer image is active — and, if you have an area selected, only within
that selection. This restriction is designed to let you modify just the portion
of the image you want, but it can also be confusing if you forget that you have
made a selection or changed layers: Your effect may not appear to work. If
your image has multiple layers, choose the layer you want before applying
an effect. Effects don’t work on Vector or Adjustment layers. If you use an
Adjustment layer, you must merge it with your image if you want your effect
to act on that adjustment. (See Chapter 14 for more information about
layers.) If you haven’t created any layers, or added text, lines, or shapes
to your image, don’t sweat the layer thing.
Effects don’t work on 256-color images. If your image has 256 or fewer colors,
Paint Shop Pro asks whether it’s okay to automatically increase the color
depth to 16.7 million. Click OK, and then see Chapter 19 if you want it to stop
asking these silly questions.
If you use a certain adjustment often, you can save its settings as presets; see
Chapter 18 for more details on this timesaver.
144
Part III: Improving Appearances 

Try ’Em On: Browsing the Effects
An easy way to try an effect on your image is to use the Effect browser.
Choose Effects➪Effect Browser. The Effect Browser dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 8-1.
Choose an effect on the left side; as you can see in Figure 8-1, each of the
effects is grouped into folders — which are, conveniently enough, the same
categories we list in the preceding section. (Adjustments, as we mention in
Chapter 7, can also be found here; click the Adjustments folder to see a con-
stellation of color shifts, blurs, and focusings that improve the quality of your
image.)
You can expand a folder by clicking the plus box to the left of it, or you can
collapse it by clicking the minus sign. Click in any of the folders to get sam-
ples of all the effects within each folder; the preview window on the right side
gives you a rough idea of what the effect does to your image. The preview can
give you only a rough impression because many effects vary depending on
how you adjust them. Figure 8-1 shows all the effects in the Artistic Effects
folder applied to an image of trusty Alex.
If your computer is taking a long time to render the effects, check the Quick
Render box on the right side, which creates a quick-and-dirty thumbnail ver-
sion of the effects. If you want the full Monty in finely rendered glory, feel free
to uncheck it.

Chapter 8: Creating Artsy Effects

If you have a selected area, or if the active layer contains only one filled-in
area, that area fills the preview window. Remember that effects apply to only
the active layer.
If you find an effect you think you may like, click the Apply button. If you
want to tweak the settings of effect or adjustment, clicking the Modify button
displays a dialog box that lets you change the settings, if there are any to
change. If you don’t like what the image looks like after the Effect Browser 
finishes up, press Ctrl+Z or click the Undo button on the toolbar.
3-D: Holes, Buttons, and Chisels
Except for the Buttonize effect, you must select an area before you apply any
of the 3-D effects. The area you select is what is turned into a button, chis-
eled, cut out, or beveled inside or outside the selection marquee. Also, if you
intend to use background color for the Buttonize, Chisel, or Inner Bevel
effect, choose it now.
Choose Effects➪3D Effects. Then, choose one of these options from the menu
that appears:
 Buttonize: Creates a raised appearance (inside your selection if you
have made a selection). Because it’s a Web thing, we discuss buttoniza-
tion in Chapter 17.
 Chisel: Creates a raised appearance by making an edge outside your
selection. In the Chisel dialog box that appears, increase the edge width
by increasing the Size value. Choose Transparent Edge to see through
the edge, or Solid Color otherwise.
 Cutout: Creates the illusion of cutting out your selected area and extend-
ing a shadow in two directions. Drag the Vertical and Horizontal sliders
left or right to extend the shadow from different edges. Increase the
Opacity setting to darken the shadow, or increase Blur to blur the
shadow’s edge. You can change the color of the shadow or the underly-
ing surface by clicking the Shadow Color swatch or the Fill Interior with
Color swatch, respectively. Then choose a color from the Color dialog
box that appears.
 Drop Shadow: Drops a shadow in any direction from your selected area,
as though that area were floating over a surface. In the Drop Shadow
dialog box that appears, drag Vertical and Horizontal sliders to change
the shadow location — or, if you want something a little more intuitive,
you can click the crosshairs in the left window and drag them around
the central circle to indicate which way (and how far away) you want
the shadow to fall. The Opacity, Blur, and Color settings work exactly
the same way as they do in the Cutout section.
146
Part III: Improving Appearances 

 Inner Bevel or Outer Bevel: Creates an effect like raising a pyramid.
The pyramid’s sloping sides (the bevel) appear within your selection
area for Inner Bevel or outside them for Outer Bevel. A rather complex-
looking dialog box appears. Click the Bevel illustration to choose a bevel
profile from a gallery. (Each profile is like the cross-sections you see of
wood moldings in a hardware store.) To see what other controls do,
either fiddle with them or see the section “Common Adjustments,”
later in this chapter.
Art and Artistic Effects: Simulating
Traditional Art Media and Beyond
Paint Shop Pro offers way too many artistic effects for us to discuss them
individually here. We show you a couple of examples in this section.
Choose Effects➪Artistic Effects or Effects➪Art Media Effects and Paint Shop
Pro reveals a large menu of possibilities. (As we said earlier, Art Media tends
to simulate things you can do in real life, like turning your picture into a pencil
drawing, and Artistic Effects transform your picture into another media
entirely, like an old newspaper or hot chrome.) Choose one from the list.
Nearly all these effects display an adjustment dialog box (refer to Chapter 7 for
an explanation of the basic controls). See the section “Common Adjustments,”
later in this chapter, for help regarding more specialized controls. For the most
part, your best approach is to fiddle with the controls for a while. A few effects
take place immediately. If you don’t like the result, press Ctrl+Z to undo it.
Not all the effects capable of making artistic results are neatly categorized on
the Artistic Effects or Art Media Effects menu selection! For instance, we find
that applying the Edge Preserving Smooth adjustment creates a wonderful
painted result, and adding Noise can speckle a picture to make it look old.
Here are a few more general tips for using artistic effects:
 If the result is too fuzzy, try decreasing various values (especially density,
if that adjustment exists). Most effects do some blurring, so if you turn it
down a bit (decrease the effect), the image becomes clearer.
 If the result is too speckly or has too many lines, look for a detail adjust-
ment and if you find one, turn it down.
 Some effects that do stuff with edges need a little help. Try running the
Edge Enhance effect (choose Effects➪Edge Effects➪Enhance) or boost-
ing contrast before applying your artistic effect. Or, in the adjustment
box for your edge-fiddling effect, look for an intensity control and
increase it.
147
Chapter 8: Creating Artsy Effects

Example 1: Topography
Topography is, for no particularly good reason, one of our favorite artistic
effects. Its result is an image that looks like stacked, cut sheets of cardboard
or foamboard (like the ones architects use in models to simulate sloping
ground). Figure 8-2 shows the creation of Sir Topography.
The controls do the following:
 Width: At low Width settings, contours follow the details of the picture
more closely. At high Width settings, contours are broad and without
sharp turns; detail is lost.
 Density: Density controls the number of layers in the virtual stack of
layers. A higher density results in a surface that conforms more to the
original detail. A lower density gives a more abstract result.
 Angle: The Angle control in the Lighting section determines the direc-
tion from which light is coming to illuminate the side of the stack. Drag
its clock-hand-like control to point in the direction you want this light to
shine.
 Color: Color determines the color of light that strikes the stack from the
side. Originally, the Color control is set to white. To change it, you may
either left-click the swatch (to choose from the Color Wheel) or right-
click (to choose a basic or recently used color from the Recent Colors
dialog box).

Part III: Improving Appearances 

Example 2: Brush strokes
The Brush Strokes effect has lots of things to fiddle with, and you probably
have to spend some time fiddling to get a result you like. It gives the appear-
ance of applying thin or thick paint with a brush. In real life, the edges of
paint strokes catch any incidental light, and in this effect you can simulate
that appearance in varying degrees. Figure 8-3 shows a photograph of faithful
Alex, who stays there forever as long as you keep stroking his fur.
The Brush Strokes controls work as follows:
 Length: Short lengths (low values of Length) create a stippled effect, like
someone poking the end of a brush into the canvas. Longer lengths pro-
duce visible stroke directions.
 Density: Density determines the number of strokes. The greatest sensi-
tivity of this control is at the very low end. A very low density (1 or 2)
gives the appearance of a few strokes made over a photograph. Higher
density makes a more abstract effect of many overlaid strokes.
 Bristles: A higher value of Bristles gives the distinct patch of paint that a
nice, new, neatly trimmed brush, packed densely with bristles, lays
down. A lower value simulates the scratchy result of a brush where the
bristles are few or frazzled.
 Width: The Width control determines the width of the brush stroke.
A higher value makes a wider brush.
Figure 8-3:
Brush
strokes, one
of the more
complex
effects.
149
Chapter 8: Creating Artsy Effects

 Opacity: The Opacity control sets the density of the paint. A low value
gives a blurred effect that is more like looking through frosted glass than
anything else. A high value makes paint look like it was applied thickly,
as though with a palette knife.
 Softness: The Softness control gives a smoother look to the paint sur-
face, with less speckling.
 Angle: The Angle control determines the direction of the incident light
that glints off the edges of thick paint strokes. Drag the clock-hand-like
control to point toward the source of the light.
 Color: To change the color of incident light striking the paint edges, click
the Color swatch and choose from the Color dialog box. (Or right-click
to choose from the Recent Colors dialog box.) Black gives no incident
light, a dark color (low lightness value) gives a little, and so on. High
lightness values strongly emphasize the stroke edges.
Like many effects, if you return to this adjustment dialog box later, it normally
resumes whatever settings you last used. This intelligent behavior saves you
lots of time returning to settings you like.
If you use this effect often, you may want to save any given combination of
settings as a preset for later use. See the section in Chapter 18 about presets.
Geometric, Distortion, and Image Effects:
Curls, Squeezes, Wraps, and Waves
Paint Shop Pro has enough curls, squeezes, and waves to outfit an entire
army of cute toddlers. If you want anything bent, distorted, or wrapped,
Paint Shop Pro can tie it up in a knot.
Choose Effects➪Geometric Effects, Effects➪Distortion Effects or Effects➪
Image Effects and then choose from the large list that appears. As with the
Artistic Effects, Paint Shop Pro has too many effects for us to try to cover
completely. Fortunately, most controls are either self-evident or do some-
thing you can easily figure out by playing with them. We give you a couple
of examples, though.
Here are a few tips for using Geometric effects:
 Some effects are centered on a particular location. To move the center,
adjust the Horizontal and Vertical controls. A setting of zero centers the
effect horizontally or vertically. Negative horizontal values are to the left
of center; negative vertical values are above center.
150
Part III: Improving Appearances 

 Remember that you can apply any effect to a particular area by selecting
that area first. Using a feathered edge on the selection feathers the modi-
fied image into the original image.
Need a thinner face? If you have a portrait on a plain background, Paint Shop
Pro can help. First, carefully select the face. Then, equally carefully, remove
areas around the eyes, nose, and mouth from the selection. (See Chapter 12
for help with removing areas from a selection.) Apply the Pinch effect on the
Distortion Effects menu.
The Page Curl effect is, for some reason, one of the most enduringly popular
geometric effects. It seems that we never tire of remarking, “Why, Martha,
that photo looks like it’s a-peelin’ right off the page!” We guess the Page Curl
effect (easily accessible by choosing Effects➪Image Effects➪Page Curl) is just
plain a-peelin’. Figure 8-4 shows this remarkable effect.
Here’s how to control your curl, with the most important stuff listed first:
Figure 8-4:
Choose a
corner,
move the
curl line in
the left
window,
and set the
radius to get
a quick curl.
151
Chapter 8: Creating Artsy Effects

 Corner: Which corner do you want to curl? Click the button depicting
your chosen corner.
 Curl Bounding Rectangle or Width and Height: To set the position of
the curl, drag the tiny gear-shaped widgets at either end of the black line
that diagonally crosses the left preview window. As Figure 8-4 shows,
your cursor becomes a four-headed arrow when it’s over the line’s end.
Alternatively, you can adjust the Width or Height values to move those
points; watch the line as you do so, and see how the Width and Height
values affect it.
 Radius: How broad do you want curl to be? The smaller the Radius
value, the tighter the corner is rolled up. The smaller the corner you’re
curling (that is, the lower the X and Y values), the smaller the Radius
value usually needs to be.
 Curl Setting Color: This setting controls the color that appears on the
highlight of the curl (the underside of the curled picture). Paint Shop
Pro makes the rest of the curl, the shaded part, the same hue, but
darker.
 Edge Mode: This setting controls the shade that appears on the flat page
revealed by the lifted corner. Click the box to choose a different color
from the Color dialog box, or right-click to choose from the Recent Colors
dialog box, or select Transparent to do away with any nasty colors.
Bear in mind that besides curling the edge of the entire image, you can select
a rectangle — a stamp on an envelope, for example — and curl that. (Other
selection shapes don’t usually work as well.)
Illumination Effects: Sunbursts
and Flares
If you need a sparkle of sunlight, unwrap the Paint Shop Pro Sunburst effect.
It places a bright spot on your image, with rays of light and circles of lens
flare. The adjustment dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-5, on top of
the image that it’s modifying, to better show the effects.
The controls for the three different components each has its own area: Light
Spot, Rays, and the Circle Brightness control. All share the same color setting.
Here’s how to use these adjustments:
152
Part III: Improving Appearances 

 Color: Click the Color sample to choose some color other than white
from the Color dialog box.
 Light Spot Brightness: Increase to brighten the light spot.
 Light Spot Horizontal/Vertical: Adjust to position the spot. Or, if you
can see a tiny set of crosshairs in the left preview window, drag that
instead. When your cursor is over the crosshairs, the cursor becomes a
four-headed arrow.
 Rays Brightness: Set this option higher to bring out the rays of light you
can see in Figure 8-5.
 Rays Density: Adjust this setting lower to see fewer rays or higher to see
more rays.
 Circle Brightness: Set this option higher to make the lens flare circles
brighter. On light photos, these circles are barely visible, even at full
brightness.
Reflection Effects: Mirrors and Patterns
The Reflection effects are a funhouse phenomenon. You can choose a single
mirror, or multiple mirrors in various configurations, turning your image into
a pattern. Choose Effects➪Reflection Effects, and then one of the four menu
items that appear:
Figure 8-5:

formation

153
Chapter 8: Creating Artsy Effects

 Feedback: The mirror-reflecting-into-mirror effect you get in barber-
shops with mirrors on opposite walls. See “Common Adjustments,” later
in this chapter, for help with this effect’s controls.
 Kaleidoscope: A humdinger of an effect, like looking at your image
through a kaleidoscope.
 Pattern: Another way, besides Kaleidoscope, to turn your image into a
pattern. See the upcoming two sections.
 Rotating Mirror: Similar to putting a mirror edge-down on your image.
You can rotate a reflection to any angle and position the mirror horizon-
tally and vertically on the image.
You can limit any of these effects to a particular area by making a selection
first.
Patterns are particularly useful in Paint Shop Pro because you can use them
to fill areas. Refer to Chapter 3, where we discuss choosing a pattern to paint
with. With the Pattern effect, you can make your own patterns to paint with.
The Pattern adjustment dialog box sets the position, angle, and number of
times your image is reflected. Fiddle with these options:
 Center of reflection: Adjust the Horizontal Offset and Vertical Offset to
position the center of your mirror that makes the pattern.
 Rotation angle: Oddly, this control gives half the rotation it’s set to. Set
it to 90, for instance, to reflect something at 45 degrees.
 Pattern size: Set Scale Factor above zero to make the pattern larger than
the original, or below zero to make it smaller.
 Number of Columns/Rows: The pattern is built of repeated rows and
columns. Set Columns/Rows values to the number of columns and rows
you want.
 Horizontal/Vertical Shift: Adjust these values to move the pattern
within your image boundaries. For instance, to get a horizontally seam-
less pattern, pixels along the left edge should match those along the
right. The Horizontal Shift control helps you do that.
To get a truly seamless pattern requires constant fiddling with two or three
controls, especially Scale Factor and the two Shift controls. (Paint Shop Pro
comes with some seamless patterns you can use as models. Refer to
Chapter 3.)

Part III: Improving Appearances 

Texture Effects: Bumpy Surfaces
from Asphalt to Weaves
Texture is the neglected third dimension of an image. Texture, the surface on
which the image is constructed, is a quality most of us don’t think about
when we think about images, but it’s very much a part of the visual experi-
ence. An image made up of mosaic tiles, for instance, feels very different from
the same image painted on canvas.
To choose a Texture effect, choose Effects➪Texture Effects and then choose
from the extensive menu that appears. Paint Shop Pro has too many textures
to cover in detail, but the next few sections should help you sort things out.
All effects except one (the Emboss effect) open an adjustment dialog box, in
which you should feel free to fiddle while watching the effect.
Relating texture effects to the
Material box’s textures
You may be a bit confused because Paint Shop Pro gives you two ways to use
texture in your images. If you’re painting an image, you can apply texture by
using the Material box (as we show you in Chapter 2). If you already have an
image, the Texture effects are the way to go.
Texture effects offer more variety and more powerful effects than the
Material box does. For instance, you can’t paint fur texture or a leather crin-
kling over an image using the Material box, but you can apply it as an effect.
Also, unlike Texture effects, which offer scads of ways to change each effect,
with Material box textures, you’re stuck with three options: the texture, the
angle, and the size. That’s it; take it or leave it.
If you find that this isn’t nearly enough meddling, you can select a sort
of superpowered Material box texture from the Texture Effects menu by
choosing — surprise — Texture. In that effect’s dialog box, you can achieve
all kinds of variations using the texture effects you can’t achieve within the
Material box itself.
(Why didn’t Jasc just provide a separate tab for textures in the Material box
that had all this stuff in one place, the way it does for gradients and colors?
Heck if we know.)
155
Chapter 8: Creating Artsy Effects

Just as the Texture effect gives you more leverage over the Material box’s tex-
tures, the Sculpture effect lets you leverage the Color palette’s patterns. The
effect’s main job is to turn your image into a sort of etching or embossing,
but it also applies patterns. Patterns are sort of like textures, but come with
their own colors. The Sculpture effect applies a Paint Shop Pro pattern, allow-
ing you to set a number of variables that are unavailable on the Material Box
palette. In the Sculpture effect, for instance, you can give a pattern a (uni-
form) color or change its size (scale).
Using texture effect controls
Texture adjustments have, in general, two main types of controls:
 Those for the virtual substance that puts ridges and valleys in the image
 Those for the light that strikes at some oblique angle and reveals that
unevenness
In addition, the virtual substances that make up some textures have optical
qualities you can adjust, like transparency and blurring.
If a texture or pattern is unclear at some settings, try zooming out in the
adjustment dialog box. (Click the magnifier-with-a-minus-sign button.)
The best way to understand most texture controls is to fiddle with them
while watching the right preview window in the adjustment dialog box. (Only
the Emboss effect goes to work immediately, without displaying a dialog
box.) Some of the more common controls you find in the adjustment dialog
boxes are shown in this list:
 Length (and occasionally Width) or Size: The dimensions of the ridges
and valleys that make up the texture.
 Blur: The overall fuzziness imparted to the original image.
 Detail: How much detail the lines of texture inherit from the edges of the
original image.
 Density: The degree to which ridges and valleys are packed closely
together.
 Transparency: The ability to let the original image show clearly through
the virtual substance that overlays the image.
 Angle: The direction from which incident light strikes the surface.
 Elevation: The height of the light source above the image. Low eleva-
tions show the ridges and valleys more strongly. High elevations make
a brighter image. Some textures allow you to set the intensity or lumi-
nance and color of the incident light as well.
 Ambience: The overall brightness (ambient light) of the image.
156
Part III: Improving Appearances 

Example 1: The Fur texture effect
A simple texture effect is Fur, excessively applied to Alex in Figure 8-6. The
Fur effect causes fibers to radiate from clusters throughout your image,
giving a result not unlike the fur of a cat engaged in discussion with a
member of the canine profession.
You go fur with this effect if you interpret your controls in the following ways:
 Blur: A kind of fluffiness control. Increasing the blur minimizes the visi-
bility of individual hairs and also makes the original image less clear.
 Density: Determines the number of hairs; very low settings give a
cactus-like, whiskered appearance.
 Length: Sets the length of individual hairs. High length values tend to
give more of a frosted-glass appearance than a furry one.
 Transparency: Determines the extent to which the original image shows
through the hair, undisturbed. High transparency values give an effect
like hair sprinkled on a photograph.
Example 2: The Texture texture effect
The Texture effect you see when you choose Effects➪Texture Effects➪
Texture gives you access to the same textures you may use for painting
with the Paint Shop Pro Color palette. Here, rather than paint with them,
you apply them to an existing image. Figure 8-7 shows faithful Alex, this
time receiving a tree-bark texture.

The controls of this dialog box provide enough fiddles to outfit a symphony
orchestra. Here’s how to make them play in tune:
 Texture: Click here and choose a texture from the Paint Shop Pro gallery
of textures that appears.
 Size (%): Make the texture pattern larger by increasing this value above
zero. Drag left (make the value negative) for a smaller pattern.
 Smoothness: To blunt the sharp edges of your texture, increase this value.
 Depth: To have deeper valleys and higher hills in your pattern, increase
this value.
 Ambience: Adjust this control for a brighter or darker image.
 Shininess: A higher value of shininess puts a bright glint on the edges
and corners of your texture pattern.
 Color: Click this swatch to choose a different color of incident light from
the Colors dialog box.
 Angle: Drag the clock-hand-like control to point toward the imaginary
light source that illuminates the texture.
 Intensity: Higher intensity increases the incident light that reveals the
contrast.
 Elevation: Lower values emphasize the hills and valleys; higher values
brighten the flat hilltops and valley bottoms. (Reduce ambience to avoid
washout at high elevations.)

Part III: Improving Appearances 

Common Adjustments
Effects use a wide range of adjustments to set their various variables. In most
cases, the function of a control becomes apparent as soon as you fiddle with
it, but in complex dialog boxes you may need to understand what does what.
This list helps you distinguish one variable from another:
 Ambience: General illumination. Determines the image brightness with
the incident light source’s intensity and elevation.
 Amplitude: The degree to which the effect is applied.
 Angle: The direction of incident light in the plane of the image. Drag the
clock-hand-like control to point toward the source.
 Blur: A fuzziness that affects mostly the original image showing through
the texture. Makes the texture fuzzier in some textures.
 Color: A swatch showing the color of light that glints off the texture’s
hills and valleys. Click the swatch to choose a new color from the Color
dialog box. (To find out how to adjust color, refer to Chapter 2.) Right-
click the swatch to choose from the Recent Colors dialog box.
 Density: The closeness and number of hills and valleys in the texture.
 Detail: The degree to which the texture picks out the detail in the original
image.
 %Effect: The degree to which the effect is applied.
 Elevation: The height of the incident light above the plane of the image.
Low elevations show the ridges and valleys more strongly. High eleva-
tions make a brighter image.
 Height: The height of the hills in the texture.
 Horizontal/Vertical Center: The position of the center of the effect.
 Horizontal/Vertical Offset: The position of the overall resulting pattern.
 Intensity: The strength of the incident light that reveals the texture.
 Length: The length of the ridges and valleys that make up the texture.
 Opacity: The degree to which the blobs of virtual substance pick up
color from the underlying image, as opposed to letting the image’s origi-
nal pixels show through.
 Presets: A drop-down list that lets you choose among any named collec-
tion of settings you have saved or your Last Used settings. After you
change any setting, the Presets selection says Custom.
 Radius: The broadness of any curve or curl; smaller radius values make
curves or curls tighter.
159
Chapter 8: Creating Artsy Effects

 Save As: A button leading to the Preset Save dialog box, in which you
enter a name to label your current collection of settings. Choose the
name from the Presets list box to recall the setting.
 Shininess: The glare off the sloping sides of the hills and valleys of the
texture.
 Size: The overall size of the elements of the texture.
 Smoothness: How rounded the bumps are that make up the texture.
 Symmetric: A check box that makes an effect work the same way in all
directions.
 Transparent/Background color: Options that either make an edge
reveal the underlying image color (Transparent) or color the edge with
the current Paint Shop Pro background color.
Framing Your Effects
So you have transformed a picture of Fido into an oil painting, complete with
sweeping strokes and a little bit of texture to flesh it out. But you still feel
unsatisfied. And that’s only natural — after all, what masterpiece is complete
without an elegant frame?
Choose Image➪Picture Frame to display the Picture Frame dialog box.
Clicking the arrow next to the Picture Frame drop-down menu will display a
gallery of frames to choose from, including modern art frames, edge brush-
ings, filmstrip frames, or the ever-popular masking-tape-on-the-corners look.
Select a frame to see a preview of your framed image on the right side.
Two radio buttons give you the option to have your frame placed on the out-
side of your image, or to have the frame jutting into the inside (and potentially
obscuring something on the edges of your picture, just like a real frame). Three
check boxes allow you to flip, mirror, and rotate the frame, exactly the same as
you would flip, rotate, or mirror an image (we show you how in Chapter 11).
When you’re ready to frame, click OK.

F
or basic painting and image processing, you rarely need to give a hoot
about how the computer handles colors. Sometimes, however, under-
standing a little about the bits behind computer color makes your life much
easier and your results better. You likely need to know about bits whenever
 Someone gives you, or you have to create, an image file that isn’t full
color, like a GIF file off the Web.
 You want to precisely adjust a color.
 You want to use a Paint Shop Pro tool that refers to Red, Green, or Blue
or Hue, Saturation, or Lightness or some other technical color term.
 That little box that follows your cursor when you’re choosing a color
from the Materials palette is driving you nuts, such as the one shown in
Figure 9-1. What do R: 86, G: 147, and B: 7 mean, for cryin’ out loud! What
are we, playing bingo? No, those are the three color components of the
color under the Dropper cursor.
Figure 9-1:
R: 86, G: 147,
and B: 7
aren’t bingo
squares.

Fortunately, the challenge isn’t so much understanding the computer as it is
understanding the illusion of color that humans have been using for about a
hundred years to print or display color images. The computer is just the
latest step in creating that illusion.
Mastering the Color Illusion
When you look at color in the real world, you’re seeing the real thing: the full
spectrum of color, from red sunsets to purple mountains plus all the colors of
fire engines, new Volkswagen Beetles, and the grassy and flowering plains in
between. When you look at mechanized color images, however, from printed
pictures to TV and computer screens, the colors you see are almost always
an illusion!
Understanding why the trick works
Although printed or displayed color images seem to be using a full range of
colors, they really use a mix of just three (or, in print, four) colors. They can
get away with this trick because your eyes have just three kinds of color sen-
sors: one kind that is most sensitive to blue, another that is biased toward
red, and a third that favors green. If truly yellow light from the real world
strikes your eye, it has an energy partway between red and green, so it tickles
both the red and the green sensors by certain amounts. Your brain says “Aha!
Red and green: It must be yellow!”
PC and TV screens use this trick to create the illusion of colors, like yellow:
Each pixel on the screen is made up of a red, blue, and green glowing dot, the
brightness of which is adjustable. The PC turns the blue way down, cranks up
the red and green, and you see yellow because your red and green sensors are
tickled equally. To get gray, all three colors are made equal; to make white,
they’re all at full strength; and to make black, they’re all zero. But it’s all an
illusion. Your PC screen cannot really make yellow, orange, magenta, or any-
thing other than pure red, green, and blue.
Fiddling with the mix
To make use of this inside information to adjust the mix of primary colors,
start with the Materials palette. Whenever you’re choosing a color in the
Available Colors area (refer to Figure 9-1), the primary color values (labeled
R, G, and B for Red, Green, and Blue) appear at the bottom of a box that fol-
lows your cursor around. (In fact, RGB values for colors appear all over Paint
Shop Pro.)
162
Part III: Improving Appearances 

Simply knowing this color’s number isn’t particularly helpful; but now that
you know what these numbers mean, you can use them to fine-tune the color
by using the Material dialog box we describe in Chapter 3.
To bring up that dialog box so that you can precisely change your fore-
ground or background material, click the Foreground Material or Background
Material square on the Materials palette. A Material dialog box appears, and
in that box is a Color tab, as shown in Figure 9-2.
You can fiddle with the color by changing the values for R, G, and B, as
described in these examples:
 Need a more pastel shade? Decrease the highest value and increase the
lower values.
 Need a purer color? Decrease the lowest of the three values.
 Need a darker or lighter shade? Decrease or increase all three values,
keeping the same proportions of each one. White occurs when all values
are 255. Black occurs when all values are 0.
 Need to move a color toward a given primary color (to make a greener
yellow, for example)? Increase that primary value (in this instance,
green); decrease the next largest value proportionately to keep the 
lightness the same.
Figure 9-2:
The Color
tab lets 
you adjust
the three
values. The
color here is
gray, so R,
G, and B 
are equal.
163
Chapter 9: Adjusting Color By Bits

Of course, you can skip all this by-the-numbers stuff and just click the color
you want, but sometimes being precise is useful. You can paint more convinc-
ing shadows in outdoor scenes, for example, if you adjust all the values pro-
portionately downward from whatever color you used for the sunlit side and
then add just a little blue. (Light in shadows tends to come from a bluish sky.)
Using Hue, Saturation, and Lightness
Fiddling with the primary color values that create the color illusion is okay,
but not easy. You may find it tricky to keep proportions adjusted, for exam-
ple, when you want a lighter shade of a color without changing the basic
color of it.
For that reason, clever people came up with a different set of three numbers
you can use to specify colors: Hue, Saturation, and Lightness (or Luminance),
called HSL. These values aren’t perfectly intuitive either, but they’re much
closer to how people think about colors than are red, green, and blue. These
three values aren’t really primary colors, but rather a primary color system:
A few numbers fully describe a color.
You may find yourself using either system in Paint Shop Pro, depending on
which controls appear in various places. Some effects, for example, use satu-
ration or lightness. The Color dialog box we describe further in Chapter 3 lets
you use either system.
The Materials palette can display color values in either system. Initially, it
shows R, G, and B. To make it show H, S, and L, choose File➪Preferences➪
General Program Preferences. In the Preferences dialog box that appears,
click the Palettes tab and then select the option Display Colors in HSL
Format. Click OK.
Here’s what H, S, and L are all about:
 Hue: You can think of hue as the basic color. If you and your spouse
both want a room painted blue, for example, or even turquoise, you
agree on hue. You still have lots of room for disagreement, however, in
terms of how pure (saturated) or light that color should be. To a rough
approximation, hue is the balance or proportion of primary colors.
 Saturation: Saturation is the least intuitive value. It’s the purity, inten-
sity, or richness of a color, independent of its hue or lightness. The most
easily understood aspect of saturation is that at zero saturation, any
color is a shade of gray (it has equal amounts of red, green, and blue).
 Lightness: Lightness — essentially, brightness — is fairly intuitive. You
can change it largely independent of hue or saturation.
164
Part III: Improving Appearances 

To better understand how HSL works and how it relates to RGB, see the Hue
color wheel and the Saturation/Lightness box in the Color dialog box
described in Chapter 3.
Color Depth and Number of Colors
Because computers use numbers to represent colors, computer images have
a unique phenomenon called color depth, or a limited maximum number of
colors. For some image types, known as true color or 24-bit images, that limit
is quite high, like 16.7 million colors. Twenty-four-bit is known as the image’s
pixel depth.
In true color images, the limit of 16.7 million colors comes from the 256 differ-
ent possible values of red, green, and blue. If you multiply 256 red values by
256 greens by 256 blues, you get 16,777,216, a number that requires 24 com-
puter bits to store; hence, the term 24-bit.
For other image types, called palette images, the limit is much less. Imagine
painting an image by using an artist’s palette that has only 64 little cups for
paint. That limit is your image’s palette size. You can use fewer than 64, or
you can change the colors in those cups, but your image can have, at most,
64 different colors. In Paint Shop Pro, no matter how small the palette, any
given marker in that palette can be one of 16.7 million colors.
In palette images, the palette size is given in either number of colors or terms
of pixel depth. Pixel depth refers to how many bits the computer needs to
count up to the palette size. It needs 1 bit to count to 2 colors, 2 bits for 4
colors, 3 for 8 colors, 4 for 16 colors, 5 for 32 colors, 6 for 64 colors, 7 for 128,
and 8 for 256. An 8-bit image, for example, is a 256-color image.
Most cameras and scanners don’t use palette images. On the Internet, how-
ever, you may find 256-color palette images, typically of the GIF type. Those
files are mostly used for drawings and artwork, like logos. Color photographs
these days are usually true-color images in JPEG file format.
Refer to Chapter 1, where we discuss various types of files and files having
different numbers of colors.
Checking your image’s color depth
To check your image’s color depth, press Shift+I or choose Image➪
Image Information. On the Image Information tab in the dialog box that
appears, look at the left-center area for Pixel Depth/Colors.
165
Chapter 9: Adjusting Color By Bits

For all you computer geeks, that value before the slash indicates the depth
in bits, and the value after the slash gives a normal human count of colors.
A true-color image, for example, reads 24/16 Million.
Increasing color depth to use more tools
For the greatest choice in color and for access to the greatest number of tools,
work with a true-color image. Many of the Paint Shop Pro advanced tools
don’t work with palette images. (Their menu commands are grayed out.)
If you start to use these types of tools on a palette image (on a GIF file, for
example), Paint Shop Pro 8 pops up an Action Required dialog box asking
whether it’s okay to promote (increase) the color depth to 16 million colors.
Just click OK.
When you go to save your work as a file, if you save it in its original form as
a palette-type file (such as GIF), Paint Shop Pro again pops up a dialog box.
This one tells you “It will be necessary to save your work as a single layer
and a maximum of (some number) of colors,” and asks whether that’s okay.
Just click Yes.
Unless you’re a wild and crazy graphics geek and have something special in
mind, if Paint Shop Pro asks permission to adjust the number of colors, you
can generally just click OK or Yes.
To manually increase the color depth to 24-bit, or true color, choose Image➪
Increase Color Depth➪16 Million Colors or press Ctrl+Shift+0 on your key-
board. After you have performed whatever tasks you need to do at this color
level, you can restore the original number of colors, if necessary (see the fol-
lowing section).
Reducing color depth for speed or size
Images with fewer colors make smaller files, use less memory, and don’t slow
down Paint Shop Pro as much. Moreover, some image file types, such as GIF
(popular on the Web), don’t allow more than 256 colors.
To decrease the number of colors in an image, choose the Image➪
Decrease Color Depth option. From the menu that drops down, choose the
color depth you want: 2, 16, 256, 32K (32 thousand), 64K, or X Colors, where
X is any number you choose.
166
Part III: Improving Appearances 

The Decrease Color Depth dialog box appears, offering all kinds of technical-
sounding options. Paint Shop Pro now has to decide exactly which colors will
be in the palette of the new image — because you’re forcing it to eliminate
colors — and also decide which colors to give the pixels whose colors are
discontinued. Here’s how to deal with that box:
 The OK button: Just click OK and don’t fret about the other settings if
you’re not finicky about results.
 Palette option buttons: (These buttons don’t appear for the 32K or 64K
color depths.) For the best accuracy of broad areas of color, at the
expense of less commonly used colors, choose Optimized Median Cut.
For the best accuracy of all colors, choose Optimized Octree. For Web
images where you want to make sure that even the most out-of-date PC
users see accurate color, choose Standard/Web-safe Palette.
 Reduction Method option buttons: For minimal file size, at the risk of
inducing blocks of dark and light colors, choose Nearest Color. For color
accuracy at the expense of detail, choose Ordered Dither Method (not
available unless you choose the Standard/Web-Safe palette option). For
the best color at the cost of graininess, use Error Diffusion.
 Number of Colors value box: If you choose the X Colors option for
color depth, you must also enter the number of colors you want in the
Number of Colors value box.
Don’t sweat the other options because they aren’t likely to be all that useful
to you. In the Decrease Color Depth dialog box, a panel in the upper-left
corner shows your original image; the upper-right corner shows what will
happen to the image as a result of your choices. Click OK if you’re okay with
the result.

Laundering Your Image for
Brightness, Contrast, and Color
In This Chapter
 Adjusting brightness and contrast
 Adjusting high, low, and mid tones
 Getting lighter colors
 Getting more intense colors
 Tinting and untinting
 Creating grayscale and monochrome images
 Creating a positive from a negative
 Using sophisticated color adjustments
A
common problem with images, especially with photographs, is that they
need laundering: better brightness, contrast, or color quality. A wedding
photo taken under a canopy, for example, may make everyone look a bit dim.
The groom’s white shirt resembles his gray tux. Perhaps the problem isn’t the
whole crowd, but only Uncle Dave — who, as people have been saying for
years, is comparatively dim. Or, maybe the poor light makes the colors of the
bridesmaids’ dresses, actually a charming sea green, look tattletale gray.
The secrets to brightening the family’s dirty laundry lie within the Paint Shop
Pro color adjustment features. Not all remedies are what you would expect
them to be. The remedy for what you may call a brightness problem, for
example, may turn out to be something called lightness, or lightness and 
contrast both.
If you’re tweaking photographs and want some simple solutions, check out
the automatic controls for contrast, brightness, and saturation (refer to
Chapter 7). Paint Shop Pro has some effects that are useful for solving spe-
cific photo flaws.

The Paint Shop Pro color features aren’t just for fixing problems, however.
They’re creative tools that can change, for example, a color photo into a
sepia one (colorizing) or make your color image look like a silk-screened
poster (posterizing).
Most Paint Shop Pro color features appear in two alternative forms; it’s your
choice which one you use:
 Adjust menu commands: Use commands on the Adjust menu if you’re
not comfortable working with layers. For example, you may use the
Adjust menu commands if you’re working on a digital photograph,
scanned-in picture, or a painted illustration.
 Adjustment layers: Use adjustment layers for more flexibility and control.
The adjustment layer approach is Jasc’s idea of a newer, better way. See
Chapter 14 to understand layers before trying to use adjustment layers.
Whether you use the Adjust menu commands or adjustment layers, the
dialog boxes containing the color controls are practically identical, so the
descriptions in this chapter work no matter which way you go.
Like most Paint Shop Pro effects, color adjustments can be limited to a partic-
ular area of an image, like the area occupied by dim, old Uncle Dave. Here are
a few points to keep in mind about that phenomenon:
 If you have made a selection, only the selected area is affected by your
adjustments.
 If you’re using multiple layers in your image, commands on the Adjust
menu affect only the selected layer.
 If you’re using multiple layers in your image, consider using an adjustment
layer so that you can affect color across multiple layers.
 If a feature doesn’t appear to be working, check to see whether you have
selected an area or have made a particular layer active. If you have, the
tool is working only within that selection, or layer, and not necessarily in
the area you’re trying to change. Read all about selections and layers in
Part IV.
Using the Adjustment Dialog Boxes
All the dialog boxes for color and brightness adjustment have similar con-
trols. We summarize those features in this section. The Brightness/Contrast
dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-1, provides an example. Note that the slider
shown in the figure appears only when you click and hold down the mouse
button on the larger down arrow at the far right end of a value box.
170
Part III: Improving Appearances 

Making adjustments
You have several ways to adjust settings in the dialog boxes:
 In adjusting value boxes, you may type a value, click the associated up
and down arrows, click in the value box and press the up- and down-
arrow keys on the keyboard, or click and hold the larger down arrow to
the right of the box and drag the slider that appears.
 Some adjustments appear as sliders: Drag sliders to the left or right, up
or down. Dragging varies an associated value (number) that appears in a
text box to the right of each slider. Dragging left or down reduces that
value, and dragging right or up increases it. Alternatively, click a slider
and then press the up- and down-arrow keys on the keyboard to increase
or decrease its value by one.
 To give precise values, double-click in the box where the value appears
and type a new value.
 To reset adjustments to their original (default) levels, click the Reset to
Default button (refer to Figure 10-1).

171
Chapter 10: Laundering Your Image for Brightness, Contrast, and Color

After you make an adjustment, click OK to apply it to your image. Before you
apply it, however, use the proofing or previewing tools that we describe in
the following section.
Changes are rarely final in Paint Shop Pro because you can undo them by
pressing Ctrl+Z or choosing Edit➪Command History (refer to Chapter 1).
Proofing or previewing your adjustments
All the color adjustment dialog boxes let you see the effect of your adjust-
ments in the main image window, a feature called proofing. The change isn’t
permanent until you click the OK button. If you cancel out of the dialog box,
the change doesn’t occur. You have two ways to proof:
 Click the Proof button — the one with the eye icon — after every 
adjustment.
 If you find yourself clicking the Proof button too often, try using Auto
Proof. Click the Auto Proof button — the creepy eyeball with a padlock —
shown in Figure 10-1. Paint Shop Pro now shows the effect of your
changes in the main image window every time you make a change.
For large images, however, you may find this proofing method slow.
The dialog boxes for commands on the Adjust menu also have preview win-
dows that let you see the effect of your adjustments without the long wait
that proofing sometimes entails. Here’s how to preview your changes:
 To zoom in or out within the preview windows, click the Zoom In button
(marked with a +) or Zoom Out button (with a –), as shown in Figure 10-1.
 To move the image in the preview window so that you can see a new
area, drag the image in either window.
 To quickly move to a new area of the image, click the Navigate button, as
shown in Figure 10-1, and keep the mouse button depressed. A small ver-
sion of the entire image is displayed, with a rectangle representing the
preview area. Drag the rectangle to the area you want to preview and
then release the mouse button.
Getting Brighter, Darker,
or More Contrast-y
We have been trying for years to be brighter, and now Paint Shop Pro has
shown us the light. But just what is brightness? If you increase the brightness
of an image, it basically looks whiter. You are, in effect, telling Paint Shop Pro
172
Part III: Improving Appearances 

“More white, please.” This whitening affects all shades uniformly, sort of like
using bleach in mixed laundry: Lights get whiter, and so do the darks.
(Decreasing brightness does the opposite — like washing a new pair of black
jeans with your laundry.) This effect also changes your colors — noticeably,
if they’re very light or dark. Brightness alone rarely does the job you want.
Because brightness alone rarely does the job, Jasc puts the Paint Shop Pro
adjustments for brightness and contrast together. Contrast is a bit like a laun-
dry brightener that makes the lights lighter and the darks darker. (It isn’t too
picky about keeping your colors exactly right, though.)
If brightness and contrast adjustment sounds like the answer to your needs,
you have two alternative solutions:
 Choose Adjust➪Brightness and Contrast➪Brightness/Contrast: The
Brightness/Contrast adjustment dialog box shown in Figure 10-1 arrives,
bringing enlightenment.
 Choose Layers➪New Adjustment Layer➪Brightness/Contrast: This
option adds a Brightness/Contrast layer. The Layer Properties dialog
box appears, with the Adjustment tab displayed. See Chapter 14 for help
with using layers.
Adjust the Brightness and Contrast % values up or down to see whether you
can achieve the results you want. Brightness ranges from –255 to +255;
Contrast % ranges from –100 to +100. In Figure 10-1, we turned up both bright-
ness and contrast.
Laundering Lights, Mediums,
and Darks Separately
Sometimes, the best way to clean something up is to separately launder what
we call three different tonal ranges: lights, darks, and midrange colors. Paint
Shop Pro gives you several ways to process these different tonal ranges 
separately:
 The Highlight/Midtone/Shadow (HMS) control: Choose Adjust➪
Brightness and Contrast to display straightforward control. (It’s not
available as an adjustment layer, however.) Check out the upcoming 
section.
 The Levels control and the Curves control: Both are available by
choosing Adjust➪Brightness and Contrast menu and also as an adjust-
ment layer. They are a bit more sophisticated and flexible than the previ-
ous control and avoid certain weirdnesses that can arise with the
Highlight/Midtone/Shadow control. See the section “Using More
Sophisticated Color Adjustments,” near the end of this chapter.
173
Chapter 10: Laundering Your Image for Brightness, Contrast, and Color

The Highlight/Midtone/Shadow controls enable you to adjust separately the
darkest regions (shadows) of your image, the lightest regions (highlights),
and the regions in between (midtones). To adjust these regions, follow these
steps:
1. Choose Adjust➪Brightness and Contrast➪Highlight/Midtone/Shadow.
The Highlight/Midtone/Shadow (HMS) dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 10-2.
2. Click the Dynamic Adjustment Method option, if it’s not already
selected.
The other option, Linear Adjustment Method, is a throwback to an older
adjustment method. Jasc included it because some old-time users and
experts prefer it. The older method is great for graphics geeks but pretty
weird for the rest of us.
3. Adjust any value downward to darken hues or upward to lighten
them.
You can think of each value as a sort of brightness adjustment, one each
for the shadow, midtone, and highlight areas. To darken shadows, for
example, adjust the Shadow value downward. To darken highlights,
adjust the Highlight value downward. You can even make dark areas
lighter than the light areas, or vice versa. It’s a weird effect.
The more a pixel’s value is within a given range, the more the control for
that range affects it. The more shadowy a shadow, the more the Shadow
control affects it. Likewise, brighter highlights are more affected by the
Highlight control, and more midrange midtones are more heavily
adjusted by the Midtone control.
Figure 10-2:
Adjusting
highlights,
midtones,
and
shadows

lets you

174
Part III: Improving Appearances 

Just as with the Paint Shop Pro Brightness/Contrast control, adjusting bright-
ness can affect the color of an area. If your shadows, for example, have a
slightly blue cast, they become noticeably blue if you lighten them. (Many
shadows in outdoor photographs are slightly blue because of the incidental
light cast by a blue sky.)
Laundering for Lightness,
Color Intensity, and Hue
Brightness and contrast are useful, but they’re sort of like the laundry tools
of yesterday. The way they work, which sometimes can alter colors, doesn’t
fully address the needs of a color world.
The Paint Shop Pro Hue/Saturation/Lightness control, on the other hand, lets
you more safely launder a mixed color load. It gives you brighter colors
(lightness) and richer colors (saturation) without risk to your delicate hand-
washables, whatever they might be, metaphorically speaking.
To access this modern washday miracle, as with most color controls, you
have two choices:
 Choose Adjust➪Hue and Saturation➪Hue/Saturation/Lightness: The
Hue/Saturation/Lightness dialog box, shown in Figure 10-3, springs col-
orfully into action.
 Choose Layers➪New Adjustment Layer➪Hue/Saturation/Lightness:
This action adds a Hue/Saturation/Lightness layer. The Layer Properties
dialog box appears, with the Adjustment tab displayed. (See Chapter 14
for help with using layers.)
175
Chapter 10: Laundering Your Image for Brightness, Contrast, and Color
Equalizing and stretching fix both highs and lows
If your images are either lacking in extremes of
highlight or shadow or have too much of both,
Paint Shop Pro offers lots of alternatives: con-
trast, highlight/midtone/shadow (HMS) adjust-
ment, saturation, and gamma, for example. A
simple alternative worth trying is to give your
image some gentle exercise: equalizing or
stretching.
Equalizing gives a more even distribution
of pixels from dark to light. Usually, it’s the 
solution you want. Stretching tends to extend
the highlights and brighten the overall pic-
ture. Choose either Adjust➪Brightness and
Contrast➪Histogram Equalize or Adjust➪
Brightness and Contrast➪Histogram Stretch.
(Each command does its job immediately with-
out providing a dialog box or any other means
of adjustment.)

The instructions for how to adjust lightness, saturation, and hue are the same
for either method. We give them in the next three sections of this chapter.
Hue/Saturation/Lightness (or HSL, to its friends) and Red/Green/Blue (RGB)
are two totally different but equally valid systems for specifying colors on a
computer. Refer to Chapter 9 for more information about these systems.
Lightness: Brightening without bleaching
Lightness is like a brightness adjustment, only without the bleaching effect
on dark colors. Unlike the brightness adjustment, which makes everything
brighter by the same amount, the lightness adjustment adjusts proportion-
ately. Dark areas become slightly brighter, and light areas become more
bright. A second benefit of this proportional adjustment is that the colors
remain more true to the original, except that some are pushed to near-white
or near-black.
For a brighter image, increase the Lightness value in the Hue/Saturation/
Lightness dialog box. For a darker image, decrease the value. The range is
from –100 to +100.
Figure 10-3:
For brighter,
richer
colors, try
the Hue/
Saturation/
Lightness
adjustment.
176
Part III: Improving Appearances 

Saturation: Getting more or less intense
Is your image a bit gray and lackluster? For more intense colors (increased
saturation), increase the % Saturation value in the Hue/Saturation/Lightness
dialog box. Your reds get redder; your greens, greener; your chartreuses,
chartreusier; and so on. For less saturation, decrease the value. Values in
the Saturation box range between –100 and +100.
The easiest way to understand what saturation does is to go the opposite
direction from the way you’re probably interested in: decrease saturation.
Adjusting saturation downward makes a color image black and white (also
called grayscale) by degrees.
Hue-ing and crying
We suggest leaving the Hue control in the Hue/Saturation/Lightness dialog box
alone because it is not a particularly useful or For Dummies–level feature. If
you find the idea of adjusting hues attractive, you probably want a completely
different control. See the following section about altering the overall tint.
Altering an Overall Tint
Are your overalls the wrong tint? Paint Shop Pro can’t fix that laundry 
problem — unless, of course, you have a picture of your overalls.
Images, whether the subject is overalls or not, sometimes have — or need —
an overall tint. Portraits taken in a forest setting, for example, tend to make
people look a bit green because of the light reflected off the leaves. Or, you
may want to add a slight orange tint to a sunset picture.
Paint Shop Pro, as it does with most color controls, gives you several ways to
alter tint:
 Choose Adjust➪Color Balance➪Red/Green/Blue: The Red/Green/Blue
dialog box that appears is the simplest control for altering overall tint.
 Choose Adjust➪Color Balance➪Color Balance: Color Balance and
Curves tint shadows, midtones, and highlights separately.
As we point out in Chapter 9, everything you see on your PC screen (or TV
screen, for that matter) is made up of a mixture of red, green, and blue, so you
can get any tint you like by adjusting the balance of those primary colors.
177
Chapter 10: Laundering Your Image for Brightness, Contrast, and Color

Choose Adjust➪Color Balance➪Red/Green/Blue and the Red/Green/Blue
dialog box appears. Like all dialog boxes for commands on the Adjust menu,
it has preview windows and proofing controls, plus one sliding control for
each primary color: Red %, Green %, and Blue %.
To make your image more red, green, or blue, the solution is straightforward:
Increase the value for that color. (Decrease it for less of that color.) Values
range from –100 to +100.
Choose Adjust➪Color Balance➪Color Balance, and the Color Balance dialog
box appears. It works much like the Red/Green/Blue dialog box, but you get
to choose whether the controls apply to shadows, midtones, or highlights.
Choose by first clicking the corresponding radio button (such as Shadows)
for the tonal range you want to change; then move the sliders toward what-
ever tone you want more of (Red, for example).
Going Gray with a Tint: Colorizing
We all go gray. Some of us try to add an attractive tint when that happens.
The same scheme can be even more attractive when applied to images.
Paint Shop Pro calls this process colorizing. But, unlike the colorizing you
may have seen used to make old black-and-white movies look as though they
were shot in color, colorizing in Paint Shop Pro imparts only a single hue to
the image. In effect, the result is a grayscale (monochrome) image done in
your chosen hue rather than in gray.
The best Paint Shop Pro tool for this process is the Colorize tool, and it
works like this:
Choose Adjust➪Hue and Saturation➪Colorize to display the Colorize
dialog box.
The Colorize dialog box grabs its crayons and reports for duty. The Colorize
dialog box sports two adjustments:
 Saturation: Increase this value to determine how much color is applied.
If you set it to 0, the image is strictly grayscale (black and white). At 255,
the image has no gray but is purely the hue you choose by adjusting the
Hue control.
 Hue: Click and hold on the tiny down arrow at the right end of Hue value
box. A rainbow-colored slider appears. Drag to the hue you want and
then release the mouse button.
178
Part III: Improving Appearances 

Going Totally Gray or
Negative in One Step
You’re just one step away from going gray, or becoming completely negative.
The Paint Shop Pro commands for Negative Image and Grey Scale, on the
Adjust menu, are simple enough to do their work in a single step: You get no
dialog box and have no adjustments to make.
Choose Adjust➪Negative Image and Paint Shop Pro gives you the negative of
your image. Lights become darks, darks become lights, and the colors switch
to their opposing colors on the color wheel. Reds become cyan, yellows
become blue, and so on. Changing an image from positive (normal) to nega-
tive isn’t often useful, but sometimes you need to go the other way. That
event occurs when you (or whoever is supplying your images) is using a film
scanner and scans a film negative. The Negative Image command gives you
the normal (positive) image you want.
To turn your color image into shades of gray (like a black-and-white photo),
choose Image➪Grey Scale. Going grayscale affects the entire image, even if
you have selected an area. If you want to turn just a certain area grayscale,
select that area and, using the Hue/Saturation/Lightness dialog box described
earlier, set the Saturation control to the minimum.
Using More Sophisticated
Color Adjustments
Paint Shop Pro is, after all, Paint Shop Pro, so it offers some sophisticated
color adjustments for professional computer graphics mavens. Why, how-
ever, should those guys have all the fun?
Here are some rudimentary instructions for using a handful of these high-
falutin’ controls. They’re available in the same two forms as other color 
controls:
 Choose Adjust from the Brightness and Contrast menu. (Just poke
around. You’ll find ’em.)
 Adjustment layers, accessed through the Layers menu or Layer palette
(see Chapter 14 for more information about layers).
179
Chapter 10: Laundering Your Image for Brightness, Contrast, and Color

Levels
The Levels control lets you adjust brightness and contrast within three differ-
ent tonal ranges: shadows (darker pixels), highlights (lighter pixels), and mid-
tones (pixels in the middle). Choose Adjust➪Brightness and Contrast➪Levels
to open the dialog box shown in Figure 10-4. The dialog box has two controls:
Input levels and Output levels. Each control is a horizontal line, attractively
studded with diamonds you can drag.
You can think of the Input levels control as a way to adjust contrast and the
Output levels control as a way to adjust brightness. (Neither description is
perfectly accurate, but gets the idea across without getting too technical.)
Here’s how to use these controls:
 To heighten contrast by making shadows darker, drag the leftmost
(black) diamond on the Input levels control to the right.
 To heighten contrast by making highlights lighter, drag the clear (right-
most) diamond on the Input levels control to the left.
 To adjust the midtones, drag the gray (center) diamond on the Input
levels control. Drag it left to brighten or right to darken. The midtones
diamond also moves a bit when the other two do, so you may need to
readjust this diamond after moving the others.

Part III: Improving Appearances 

 To lighten shadows, drag the black diamond on the Output levels control
toward the right. (Shadows and midtones get lighter.) To darken high-
lights, drag the clear diamond toward the left. (Highlights and midtones
get darker.)
Curves
The Curves adjustment is a way to change brightness and contrast within a
specific range of tones you specify. That range can be anywhere from shad-
ows to highlights to anywhere in the middle. A Curves adjustment can, for
example, help you pull out some of the detail that’s lost in a specific range of
a photograph by increasing the contrast in that range.
Choose Adjust➪Brightness and Contrast➪Curves to display the Curves dialog
box. The main control (in the dialog box) looks like a chart. (If the chart makes
sense to you, great — otherwise, don’t worry about understanding it.)
The chart holds a curve — well, initially, it’s just a straight, diagonal line
between two points. The idea is to bend that line by adding and dragging
points.
In Figure 10-5, the three columns show three curve settings. The left column
shows the original image that has evenly distributed shades of gray from
black to white. The chart underneath shows the straight line that goes with
that even distribution. The other two columns show the effect of the curve
settings underneath the images.

their results.

Chapter 10: Laundering Your Image for Brightness, Contrast, and Color

 On the chart, click that diagonal line in the tone area you want to change
the most. Click more toward the left end of the line to adjust shadows
and click more toward the right to adjust highlights.
 Clicking adds a point to the line. For example, to change midtones, click
near the middle and add one point. Click in two places to create two
points slightly separated from each other. Adding more than one point
gives you more control over exactly which tone range you adjust.
 Drag the point (or points) up to brighten or down to darken. Drag left to
move your effect to darker pixels or right to move it to lighter pixels.
You can also drag the endpoints of the line: Drag the left end-point to
affect shadows, and drag the right endpoint to affect highlights.
 To get more contrast within a range of tones, drag points so that the
curve is steeper (more vertical) in that range.
 To get less contrast, make the curve flatter. You may need to add points
to focus your efforts on exactly the range you want.
 To remove a point you have decided you don’t need, drag it entirely out
of the chart area.
 To adjust contrast and brightness only within a given primary color
(red, green, or blue), click the selection box marked Channel and choose
your color.
Posterize
The Posterize control isn’t in the Adjust menu like the other advanced con-
trols we discuss in this section, but it does interesting things with colors.
Choose Effects➪Artistic Effects➪Posterize to launch the Posterize dialog box.
In posterizing, an image takes on the appearance of a silk-screened poster,
made up of areas of a few uniform colors. Posterizing reduces the number of
colors that appear and results in blocks of color, like a paint-by-numbers
painting.
The dialog box for posterizing has only one adjustment, named Levels.
Reduce the value to reduce the number of colors or increase it to increase
colors. The value in Levels determines the number of levels of brightness in
the image.
Threshold
The threshold control (choose Adjust➪Brightness and Contrast➪Threshold)
gives you images in pure black and pure white. With a threshold control,
you’re telling Paint Shop Pro, “Turn any pixel with a brightness below a given
threshold black, and turn any pixel above that threshold white.”
182
Part III: Improving Appearances 

The dialog box for this layer has a single adjustment. Reduce the Threshold
value for a lower threshold (more white) and increase it for a higher thresh-
old (more black). You can use a threshold value between 1 and 255.

Changing and
Adding Content

In this part . . .
P
art IV has solutions when you’re concerned with an
image’s content, not its quality. Discover how to
pluck out, put in, or move a person, product, or other
object in an image. Turn to this part for cropping, resizing,
rotating, or distorting an image (or just part of an image).
To crop, resize, reproportion, ﬂip, mirror, reorient, bend,
spindle, or mutilate an image, turn to Chapter 11.
In Chapter 12, you see how to select parts of an image —
the key trick for changing content. Want to abstract your
better half from photo A into photo B? Normally, Paint
Shop Pro can’t tell your spouse from a sofa, so (assuming
that you can tell the difference) it’s up to you to tell Paint
Shop Pro, “Pat’s the one in green” or to outline Pat by
hand. You can even change the color, or other qualities,
such as contrast or sharpness, of the selected item.
Selecting lets you apply to particular items nearly any of
the Paint Shop Pro powers.
After you have selected your spouse, you may want to
move, copy, or reshape that person. As inadvisable as
such a project may be in real life, it’s a simple matter in
Paint Shop Pro. Chapter 13 is the place to turn for moving,
copying, or other dimensional or reproductive changes.
Adding content is another trick that Paint Shop Pro can
help you with. In Chapter 14, we show you how to combine
multiple images or create layered images where you can
manipulate different objects without affecting the underly-
ing stuff. Layers make later editing much easier, produce
cool image overlays, and can even make qualitative
changes, such as contrast or saturation, easier to manage.
To add text and shapes to an image, turn to Chapter 15,
where we show you how the Paint Shop Pro vector graph-
ics and text tools can give you layers of easily edited
material — and we show you how to edit that material.

I
t happened several times to Alice, of Wonderland fame: She needed to be
bigger and smaller or to change her orientation. Fortunately, you don’t
have to adopt her dubious pharmacological methods — eating and drinking
mysteriously labeled substances — to change the size or orientation of your
images.
No, to make your pictures bigger, smaller, rotated, or otherwise reoriented,
you need to indulge in only a few clicks on well-labeled commands or icons.
In this chapter, we illuminate your choices as you navigate the Paint Shop Pro
rabbit hole.
If your image appears smaller than you think it should be when you first open
it, Paint Shop Pro has probably zoomed the image out to fit your window. To
zoom in, click the Zoom (magnifier) tool from the Pan and Zoom toolset and
then left-click the image.

Getting Sized
Size may not be everything, but it’s certainly one of the things people are
often concerned about — or ought to be. You don’t need a 1024 x 768-pixel
image, for instance (which is full-screen size on many PCs), for a snapshot of
your new company CEO on your Web site. If you didn’t get an appropriately
sized CEO (okay, an image of a CEO) in the first place, you can trim that
person down in Paint Shop Pro. Likewise, if you’re rushing to prepare the
opening screen for a company presentation and the only way you can get a
logo is to scan in the tiny one on your letterhead, Paint Shop Pro can help
you size it up to a more presentable image.
If you’re preparing an image that someone else plans to place in a profession-
ally prepared and printed document, don’t scale it down yourself. Let your
graphics designer or printer do the scaling to suit the printing process.
Start resizing by choosing Image➪Resize. The Resize dialog box appears in
order to help you size the situation up — or down (see Figure 11-1).
Figure 11-1:
Sizing your
image up —
or down.
188
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

Proportioning
The Resize dialog box normally keeps the image’s proportions (relationship
of width to height) constant while you resize. If you set width, therefore,
Paint Shop Pro sets height for you (and vice versa). Keeping image propor-
tions constant avoids distortion.
If you prefer to change the proportions (which distorts your image), you
can click to clear (deselect) the check box labeled Lock Aspect Ratio __ To 1,
as shown in Figure 11-1, and Paint Shop Pro lets you set width and height
independently.
Dimensioning
Using the Resize dialog box, as shown in Figure 11-1, you can adjust the size
in one of three ways, all of which do the same thing: change the image’s size
in pixels. Use whichever way suits your mindset:
 Specify size in pixels: If you’re using the image on the Web or in e-mail,
you probably have a pixel size (probably a desired width) in mind.
Select Pixels from the drop-down menu next to the Width and Height
controls and then enter a value for Width (or Height).
 Make it X% of its current size: Select Percent from the drop-down menu
next to the Width and Height controls and then enter a value for Width
(or Height). In Figure 11-1, for instance, the setting of 66 makes the image
2⁄3 (66 percent) of its current size. To double the image size, use 200.
 Make it print bigger or smaller: Select which measurement you want to
use (inches or centimeters) from the menu on the right side and then
use the Width or Height controls in the Print Size section to make the
image print as large as you want. Paint Shop Pro multiplies this physical
size (in inches, for example) by the resolution setting (pixels per inch)
in this dialog box and calculates a new image size in pixels. You can also
change the value in the Resolution text box to adjust the image resolu-
tion (pixels per inch or centimeter). Don’t confuse this setting with the
printer’s resolution (typically 300 to 600 dpi); see Chapter 16 if you are
confused about printing and resolution!
If your image has several layers and you want them all resized the same,
make sure to check the Resize All Layers check box. If you clear that check
mark, you resize only the active layer. Click OK to make the resizing happen.
189
Chapter 11: Getting Bigger, Smaller, and Turned Around

Avoiding degradation
Resizing sounds easy: Just make the image bigger or smaller. What’s to think
about? Well, usually, you don’t have to think about anything. Occasionally,
however, your image’s appearance degrades after resizing. It has jagged or
fuzzy edges. These situations call for a little thought.
Behind the resizing issue is another difference between how computers and
humans think. If you want your image to be 25 percent bigger, Paint Shop Pro
has to figure out how to spread 100 pixels over 125 pixels. To get an idea of
the problem, imagine dividing 100 cookies among 125 kids who don’t accept
broken cookies. Fortunately, Paint Shop Pro is pretty smart, so you don’t
have to smoosh up and bake these cookies again yourself. Unless you
instruct Paint Shop Pro otherwise, it uses the Smart Size feature to make
these decisions — it chooses the right way to do it based on what your
image looks like.
If your image doesn’t look so hot after resizing, try second-guessing the smart
resizing that Paint Shop Pro uses by default. Press Ctrl+Z to undo the ugly
resizing you just did. Then choose Image➪Resize again. In the Image Resize
dialog box that appears, click the Resize Type selection box to see the spe-
cific choices of ways to resize. Here’s what to do with those choices:
 Bicubic Resample: Choose to enlarge a realistic-looking or complex
image (like a photo) or to avoid jagged edges.
 Bilinear Resample: Choose to reduce a drawn image, one with well-
defined edges, or one with text.
 Pixel Resize: Choose to enlarge a drawn image or one with well-defined
edges. (Paint Shop Pro then simply removes or duplicates pixels in order
to resize.)
 Weighted Average: Choose to reduce a drawn image, one with well-
defined edges, or one with text if the Bilinear Resample option doesn’t
work out.
Click OK to proceed with the resizing. If your image doesn’t look better, press
Ctrl+Z to undo the last resize. Choose a different resizing method and try
resizing again.
Bilinear and bicubic resampling work for only 24-bit color images (or grayscale
images). You can use them on fewer-color images by increasing the color depth
to 24-bit, resizing the image, and then reducing the number of colors to the
original. Refer to Chapter 9 for help with changing the number of colors.
190
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

Trimming (Cropping) Your Edges
Is your image a bit shabby around the edges and in need of a trim? You can
improve the composition of many pictures by trimming (cropping) a bit off
the top, bottom, or sides. Often, for instance, snapshots are taken from too
far away, so the subject is too small. You can enlarge the image in Paint Shop
Pro, but you also need to trim it so that the overall picture isn’t yards wide.
In a layered image, cropping affects all layers.
Paint Shop Pro provides a special tool for your crops. Take these steps to
trim your image:
1. Click the Crop tool (shown in the margin) on the Tools toolbar.
The cursor icon displays a set of crosshairs.
2. Visualize a rectangular area that defines the new boundaries of your
image.
For instance, if you’re cropping a family photo taken in the backyard,
next to the trash barrels, visualize a rectangle around the family, exclud-
ing the barrels.
3. Move the crosshairs of your cursor to one corner of that visualized
rectangle and then drag diagonally toward the opposite corner.
As you drag, a real rectangle forms. The status bar at the bottom of the
Paint Shop Pro window gives you the exact pixel column and row where
the cursor is positioned, in case you need that information. As you drag,
the status bar also gives you the cursor position and the crop’s size, as
Figure 11-2 shows.
If the cropping rectangle isn’t quite right, you can modify it in one of
these three ways:
• To remove the rectangle and try again, right-click anywhere on the
image. The rectangle disappears.
• To change any side or corner of the rectangle, drag that side or
corner.
• To position the rectangle, move your cursor within that rectangle;
the cursor becomes a four-headed arrow and you can drag the rec-
tangle to any new location.
191
Chapter 11: Getting Bigger, Smaller, and Turned Around

4. When the rectangle is correct, double-click anywhere outside the crop
area.
Paint Shop Pro crops the image. If you don’t like the result, press Ctrl+Z
to undo the crop and then try these steps again. Rather than double-
click, if the Tool Options palette is open (press the F4 key if it’s not),
you can click the Crop Image button (the green check mark).
Getting Turned Around,
Mirrored, or Flipped
We can’t tell you how many people we have seen bending their necks to view
a sideways image! Apart from providing work for chiropractors, this habit
does nobody any good. Paint Shop Pro makes rotating an image simple.
Mirroring or flipping an image is equally simple. Mirrored or flipped images
are particularly useful for imaginative work, such as creating a reflection that
isn’t present in the original or making a symmetrical design, such as a floral
border.
Does your image have layers, or have you selected an area? As with many
Paint Shop Pro functions, the mirroring, flipping, and rotating commands
apply to only the active layer. If you have a selected area, mirroring and flip-
ping also restrict themselves to that area.

Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

Rotating
To rotate an image, choose Image➪Rotate➪Free Rotate or press Ctrl+R. The
Rotate dialog box appears, with a variety of option buttons:
 To rotate the image clockwise, click the Right button.
 To rotate counterclockwise, click the Left button.
 Choose 90 (a quarter-turn, good for righting sideways images), 180 (a
half-turn), 270 degrees (three-quarters turn) of rotation, or Free (see the
next bullet).
 To rotate any desired amount, choose Free and enter any rotation (in
degrees) in the highlighted text box.
Although you can use the Rotate dialog box to straighten an off-kilter photo,
there’s a better way: the Straighten tool, which we cover in Chapter 2.
If your image has multiple layers (or if you aren’t sure whether it does) and
you want to rotate the entire image, click to place a check mark in the All
Layers check box in the Rotate dialog box. Otherwise, Paint Shop Pro rotates
only the active layer. Click OK to perform the rotation.
To rotate a portion of an image, select that portion first. Or, you can use the
Deformation tool rather than the rotation command on the selection. See
Chapter 12 for help with selection and Chapter 13 to rotate a selection.
Mirroring and flipping
To mirror an image is to change it as though it were reflected in a mirror held
alongside the image. To flip an image is to exchange top for bottom as though
the mirror were held underneath the image. Note that both transformations
are unique: You can’t achieve the same result by rotating the image!
If your image has layers, mirroring and flipping commands apply to only the
active layer. If your image has an area selected, these commands float that
selection and then work on only that floating selection. See Chapter 12 for
more information about floating selections.
To mirror an image in Paint Shop Pro, choose Image➪Mirror. Your image is
transformed into its mirror image.
To flip an image, choose Image➪Flip. Your image is turned head over heels.
193
Chapter 11: Getting Bigger, Smaller, and Turned Around

Taking on Borders
Paint Shop Pro can add a border of any color and width to any image. (If your
image uses layers, however, Paint Shop Pro has to merge them. For that
reason, borders are often best left as the last thing you do to your image.)
To create a border around an image, follow these steps:
1. Choose Image➪Add Borders.
The Add Borders dialog box appears. (If Paint Shop Pro first displays a
dialog box warning you that the layers must be merged to proceed, click
OK to proceed and then refer to Chapter 1 for advice on how to turn off
these pesky reminders.)
2. Choose your color.
Click the color box to bring up the Color dialog box and then click the
shade you want to see surrounding your picture. Click OK. If this strange
array of circles and boxes proves too daunting for you, check out
Chapter 4, where we explain all.
3. Set your border widths, in pixels.
For a border that is the same width on all sides, leave the check mark in
the Symmetric check box and enter your border width in the Top, Bottom,
Left, or Right box. (It doesn’t matter which one you use; they all change
together.) For different border widths on all sides, clear that Symmetric
check mark and enter the border widths in all the boxes individually.
Click OK. Your image is now larger by the borders you have set.
Borders are no different from any other area of your image; they’re just new
and all one color.
Achieving a Particular Canvas Size
Paint Shop Pro enables you to expand the canvas size of any image: to add a
border area around the image to achieve a particular image width and height.
The Canvas Size command has the same end effect as Add Borders.
“But,” you say, wisely, “if Add Borders has the same effect, why would I bother
with the Canvas Size command?” You would bother if you were looking to
have an image of a particular size — and didn’t want to do the arithmetic to
calculate how much border to add to the existing dimensions.
194
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

You might use the canvas size command, for instance, if you were making a
catalog using images of various heights and widths and wanted all the images
to be of uniform height and width. You couldn’t resize the images because
that would distort them. If you used the add borders command, you would
have to calculate border widths to fill out each image to the right dimensions.
With canvas sizing, however, you can simply place each image on a uniformly
sized background. Here’s how:
1. Choose a canvas (border) color by setting the background color on
the Color palette.
For example, if you want a white canvas, left-click the Background
Material box (the one in the lower-right corner) and select white. (Again,
if you want more details about the Material box, Chapter 3 beckons.)
If your image has any transparent sections, check the Transparent box
for a see-through canvas. (It’s grayed out if your image is opaque.)
2. Choose Image➪Canvas Size.
The Canvas Size dialog box makes the scene.
3. Enter a new width and new height for your image in the Width and
Height boxes.
These numbers define how big your image will be, with its expanded
canvas (borders).
Paint Shop Pro also has an option that allows you to expand the canvas
proportionately; if you make the new canvas twice as wide, the height is
doubled. To enable this option, check the Lock Aspect Ratio check box.
4. Choose where you want your image positioned on the canvas.
As you can see in Figure 11-3, you can press one of ten placement buttons
to select which corner your image will be flush with. (The button in the
center centers your image.)
If these ten positions aren’t good enough for you, you can place your
image on the canvas with exacting precision by using the Placement set-
tings. The values in these boxes tell Paint Shop Pro how far away the
image should be from each of the four borders, in pixels. For example, if
you want to set your image so that it is 20 pixels away from the left side
of the new canvas, enter a value of 20 in the Left Placement box.
Be warned that negative numbers in any of the placement boxes places
at least part of the image outside the canvas border. For example, a value
of –20 pixels in the Left placement box plops your image down so that it
begins 20 pixels outside the left border of the canvas rather than 20
pixels away from the inside of the left border. This action effectively
trims 20 pixels off your image’s left side.
195
Chapter 11: Getting Bigger, Smaller, and Turned Around

Click OK and your image is mounted on a fresh canvas of your chosen size
and background color. If (as in the catalog example) you’re trying to center
many images on canvases of the same size, you may find it convenient that
your previous canvas size settings remain as you open each image. Just
choose Image➪Canvas Size for each subsequent image and click OK.

f Uncle Dave is looking a bit dark and gloomy in your wedding picture,
should the whole wedding party have to lighten up to make up for him?
Heavens, no!
If the photographer for your brochure happened to photograph the vile, lime
green version of your product, should you now be stuck with that color?
Absolutely not.
You should be able to redo your product in screaming magenta or lighten up
Uncle Dave, or maybe remove him entirely, while leaving the rest of the image
alone. In short, you need to be able to select only that portion of the image
you need to work on.
The problem is that Paint Shop Pro hasn’t the foggiest idea that your product
or your Uncle Dave are in the picture. It’s all just colored dots to Paint Shop
Pro, so you need a way to tell Paint Shop Pro things like “Select all those lime-
green-colored dots” (no, not Uncle Dave) or “Select everything within this line
that I’m drawing.” After you accomplish that, you can restrict the Paint Shop
Pro magic to the selected area and even move or remove selected portions of
an image.
Paint Shop Pro has two other features besides selection that help to remove
parts of an image, or simply restrict its actions to certain parts: the
Background Eraser.

If you’re looking to erase just the stuff around Uncle Dave, the Back-
ground Eraser is a new feature saves lots of that tedious selecting time. The
Background Eraser is smart enough (mostly) to draw a distinction between
the interesting stuff in the foreground and the boring stuff in the background,
allowing you to wipe away redundant scenery without a single selection! (We
show you how in Chapter 4.)
Layers affect the way selection appears to work, and helps to separate por-
tions of an image so that you can move them around easily without affecting
anything else — something selections can’t offer. (See Chapter 14 for layer
information.)
Selecting is a key tool for altering the content of an image. Selecting in just
the right way is the key to altering exactly the content you want. Paint Shop
Pro lets you be just as selective as you want.
In this chapter, we deal with selecting parts of your image that are bitmap
(raster) images. We don’t, however, deal with the special case of selecting
vector objects. The text and shapes that the Text, Draw, and Preset Shapes
tools make are almost always vector objects. To read about selecting vector
objects, see the discussion in Chapter 15 about controlling your objects.
Selecting an Area
Selecting is creating a restricted area in which you want Paint Shop Pro to do
its thing — a sort of construction zone. “Its thing” is whatever operation you
choose, whether it’s moving, changing color, painting, filling, smudging, filter-
ing, erasing, copying, pasting, mirroring — essentially any image change
Paint Shop Pro can perform. For instance, you can select an elliptical area
around Aunt Elizabeth in a group photo, copy that area to the Windows
Clipboard, and then paste it as a new image to create a classical cameo-style
oval image.
If you have layers in your image, selection can be slightly more complicated.
See “Avoiding Selection Problems in Layered Images,” later in this chapter.
The selected area has a moving dashed line around it, called a marquee.
Figure 12-1 shows Alex the Wonder Dog in his very own marquee.
Paint Shop Pro gives you lots of flexibility in creating a selection, as we
describe in this list:
 Make a selection:
• Drag a rectangular, circular, or other regular shape with the
Selection tool.
198
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

• Draw an outline using the Freehand tool.
• Click an area that has a more-or-less uniform color or brightness
using the Magic Wand tool.
Figure 12-2 shows those three tools on the toolbar.
 Add pixels to, or remove pixels from, your selection to modify it.
 Expand your selection to fill up any specks left in your selection and
add more to your selection based on similar colors.
 Feather or antialias the edges of a selection to keep natural-looking
edges around your selected area.
The main tools for making a selection are on the Tools toolbar, as shown in
Figure 12-2. To make them work exactly the way you want, however, you need
to use the Tool Options palette (press F4 if you don’t see it).
To make and modify selections, you can use the high-tech selection tools, as
shown in Figure 12-2, or give commands from the Selection menu. Because
you can add to or subtract from a selection with any selection tool, you may
also find yourself switching between tools to build or carve out a selection of
a particularly tricky shape.

Selecting a rectangle or
other regular shape
Selecting a rectangular area is particularly useful for copying portions of an
image to paste elsewhere as a separate image. It’s also useful for working on
portions of your image that happen to be rectangular. The Selection tool lets
you select rectangles, circles, and other predetermined shapes.
To create the selection area, click the Selection tool (refer to Figure 12-2) and
then drag diagonally on your image. You determine the shape you drag on
the Tool Options palette, as shown in Figure 12-3.

Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

Choose one of the many shape selections from the drop-down menu. Drag
diagonally to give your area both width and height. Here are a few tips for
making and changing your selection:
 Trying again: After you define a selection, you can’t resize it by dragging
sides or corners, as you may expect. (Try it and you drag the selection to
one side.) Right-click anywhere to clear the shape to try again. Or, you can
simply drag a fresh shape if you begin your new drag anywhere outside
the existing selection.
 Dragging: After you have selected an area, if you want to move that por-
tion of the image, you can drag it, exposing whatever lies beneath your
picture. Unfortunately, this feature also makes accidental dragging very
easy! As usual, just press Ctrl+Z to undo an accidental drag (or an acci-
dental anything else, for that matter).
 Modifying: To move, add to, or subtract from the selection, see
“Modifying Your Selection,” later in this chapter.
Selecting by outlining: The Freehand tool
We find the Freehand tool to be one of the most useful of the selection tools.
It lets you define the area you want by outlining. It even helps you with that
outlining, so you don’t have to scrutinize every pixel you include or exclude.
On the toolbar, click the lasso icon (the Freehand tool) shown in the margin.
The Tool Options palette then looks something like Figure 12-4. (Press the F4
key to flash the Tool Options palette on or off if you have misplaced it.)
The Freehand tool gives you four ways to snare a selection. From the
Selection Type drop-down list (refer to Figure 12-4), choose whichever of
these methods best suits the area you’re trying to select:

selection
with the
lasso (the
Freehand
tool).
201
Chapter 12: Selecting Parts of an Image

 Freehand: Drag an outline around the area you want to select. At what-
ever point you release the mouse button, Paint Shop Pro finishes the
outline with a straight line to your starting point. This method is best for
an area with a complex shape, especially if it doesn’t have a clear edge.
(If it does have a clear edge, try the Smart Edge method instead.)
 Point to Point: Click at points around the area you want to select. As
you click, the outline appears as straight line segments connecting those
points. To close the loop, double-click or right-click, and Paint Shop Pro
draws the final line segment from that point back to the starting point.
This method works well for areas with straight edges.
 Smart Edge: If the area you want to select has a noticeable edge — a
transition between light and dark, such as the edge of someone’s head
against a contrasting background — choose this type of selection. To
begin, click at any point along the edge. A skinny rectangle appears, with
one end attached to your cursor. Move your cursor to another point
along the edge so that a portion of the edge is contained entirely within
the rectangle and then click. Paint Shop Pro selects along the edge.
Continue clicking along the edge in this way; Figure 12-5 shows the
result. Double-click, or right-click, and Paint Shop Pro finishes the out-
line with a straight line back to your starting point.
 Edge Seeker: This option works much like Smart Edge, except that you
can set how wide an area it searches to find an edge (called the Range,
it’s measured in pixels). As with most Paint Shop Pro elements, you can
change the Range on the Tool Options palette. Again, to lose the loop,
double-click or right-click.
Here are a few tips for selecting with the Freehand tool:
 Aborting: You can’t abort the selection process after you begin. Instead,
right-click (or release the mouse button if you’re dragging) to finish the
loop, and then press Ctrl+D or right-click again to remove the selection.

can detect.

Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

 Undoing segments: If you’re in the middle of using Point to Point or
Smart Edge, and make a mistake, you can undo segments by pressing
the Delete key on your keyboard.
 Being precise: When using Smart Edge, click directly on or near the
edge as you go around the shape. (Put another way, don’t overshoot any
bends in the edge or let the edge exit the rectangle from the side of the
rectangle.)
 Smoothing edges: The Freehand tool provides antialiasing and feather-
ing, which, if you’re going to use them, you should set up before making
the selection. See the upcoming sections “Feathering for More Gradual
Edges” and “Antialiasing for Smoother Edges.”
 Using layers: If your image uses layers, Smart Edge normally looks for
the edge within only the active layer. If you want Smart Edge to look at
all layers combined, click to enable the Sample Merged check box.
Selecting by color or brightness:
The Magic Wand tool
Sometimes you want to select an area so uniform in appearance that you
want to simply tell Paint Shop Pro, “Go select that red balloon” or whatever it
is. To you, with your human perception, the area is an obvious thing of some
sort. In software, anything that even slightly mimics human perception is
often called magic. The Magic Wand selection tool is no exception. It can
identify and select areas of uniform color or brightness, somewhat as your
eye does.
One benefit of this tool is that you can select areas with complex edges that
would be a pain in the wrist to trace with the Freehand tool. For instance, a
selection of blue sky that includes a complex skyline of buildings and trees
would be relatively easy with the Magic Wand tool.
The Magic Wand tool doesn’t, however, work as well as your eye. In particu-
lar, if the color or brightness of the area you’re trying to select isn’t uniform
or doesn’t contrast strongly with the surroundings, the selection is likely to
be spotty or incomplete or have rough edges.
Paint Shop Pro gives you lots of ways to improve an imperfect selection. See
“Modifying Your Selection,” later in this chapter.
Making the selection
To make a selection, select the Magic Wand from the Selection toolset. Your
cursor takes on the Magic Wand icon. Click the Magic Wand cursor on your
image, and it selects all adjacent pixels that match (or nearly match) the
203
Chapter 12: Selecting Parts of an Image

pixel you clicked. (Note that the selection does not include isolated pixels —
pixels that, even though they match, are separated from the place you
clicked by nonmatching pixels.)
To get the selection you want when you use the Magic Wand tool, consult the
Tool Options palette. The Tool Options palette for the Magic Wand tool looks
like Figure 12-6. It lets you define (by using the Match mode list box) exactly
what you mean by match and lets you adjust (by adjusting the Tolerance set-
ting) how closely the selected pixels should match the one you clicked.
If your image uses layers, be sure that the active layer is the one containing
the area you want to select. Enable the Sample Merged check box on the Tool
Options palette so that the Magic Wand tool examines all layers combined.
Otherwise, the Magic Wand tool selects a totally wrong area, and you wonder
what’s happening!
Choosing Match mode for better results
Click the Match mode list box and you can choose exactly how you want
Paint Shop Pro to select the pixels around the place you clicked. Some of the
choices are shown in this list:
 RGB Value: When you choose this option, you tell Paint Shop Pro to
“select pixels that match in both color and brightness.” Clicking a red
apple using this choice may select only the highlighted side where you
clicked, for instance. Technically, it selects all adjacent pixels with red
(R), green (G), and blue (B) primary color values that match the one you
clicked.
 Hue: You’re telling Paint Shop Pro to “select pixels that match in color”
when you choose Hue. Hue, however, is somewhat more independent of
brightness than the RGB value. (Refer to Chapter 9 for help with under-
standing RGB and Hue.) Clicking on a red apple with this choice is more
likely to select the entire apple than if you chose RGB Value. Technically,
it selects all adjacent pixels with hues (in the Hue/Saturation/Lightness
color system, or color wheel) that match the hue of the pixel you clicked.

Wand tool

Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

 Brightness: Brightness disregards color and selects all adjacent pixels
whose brightness matches the one you clicked. This choice is useful for
selecting things that are similarly illuminated, like shadows and high-
lights, or that are in a notably light or dark color compared with the
background.
 Opacity: Opacity, if you’re not paying attention, is a measure of how
transparent your image is. Opacity mode selects anything that’s suitably
close to the transparency of the selected pixel.
Opacity is useful only when you’re working on layers or images with
transparent backgrounds. Even though you can technically paint a low-
opacity streak over a white background using the Brush tool, the Magic
Wand sees that even though the paint is ghostly and transparent, the
background is 100 percent opaque. It then counts the background as part
of the selection and goes on to select the entire image.
 All Opaque: This option is a special choice for when you’re working on
an image that has transparent areas — areas of no content whatever —
usually displayed with a checkered background. It tells Paint Shop Pro
to select the area that has content around the pixel where you clicked.
For instance, you may have photos of various air freshener products
on a transparent layer, artistically floating over a cow pasture in the
background. With this choice, you can just click one of the products to
select it in its entirety.
Experiment to get the mode that works best for you! Press Ctrl+D to deselect
each failed experiment, change match modes, and click again with the Magic
Wand tool.
Setting tolerance to include more or fewer pixels
The Tolerance setting on the Tool Options palette helps you determine how
much of an area is selected by the Magic Wand tool. You may have to undo
your selection with Ctrl+D, adjust the tolerance, and click again with the Magic
Wand tool several times to get the best selection possible. For an easier solu-
tion, see the discussion of expanding and filling in selections in the upcoming
section “Modifying Your Selection.”
Tolerance tells Paint Shop Pro how closely the pixels it selects should match
the pixel you clicked — in RGB value, hue, or brightness, depending on which
match mode you chose. (Tolerance doesn’t matter for All Pixels match mode.
A pixel either has content or it doesn’t.) Here’s how it works:
 Lower the tolerance value to make a less extensive selection the next
time you click.
 Raise the tolerance value to make a more extensive selection the next
time you click.
205
Chapter 12: Selecting Parts of an Image

In Paint Shop Pro, low tolerance means that the Magic Wand tool tolerates little
variation in color or brightness from the pixel you clicked. The tolerance value
itself has no particular meaning; it’s just a number.
The Tolerance value box on the Magic Wand tool’s Tool Options palette has a
clever adjustment feature you find in similar boxes throughout Paint Shop Pro.
As with these types of boxes in any Windows program, you can type a value
(from 0 to 200) in its text box or click its up or down arrow to adjust the value.
We find that the best way is to click the down arrow, or Clever adjustment fea-
ture, and hold your mouse button down. A tiny slider appears that you can
drag left or right to set the tolerance value lower or higher.
Tolerance can be a sensitive and picky adjustment. A small change can some-
times make a big difference in what gets selected. Unless you’re trying to select
an area well differentiated by color, brightness, or content, you probably have
to adjust your selected area afterward. We tell you how to do that in the next
section.
Modifying Your Selection
If you didn’t select exactly the area you wanted with one of the Paint Shop
Pro selection tools, don’t despair. You can fine-tune or completely rework
your selection in any of these ways:
 Drag the selection outline to another area of your image.
 Add to or subtract from your selection by using the selection tools.
 Expand or contract the selection’s boundary by a given number of
pixels.
 Grow the selection to include adjacent pixels of similar color or 
brightness.
 Select pixels of similar color or brightness anywhere in the image.
The following sections tell you how to do each one of those modifications.
Read on!
Moving the selection outline
To move the selection outline (marquee) to another area of your image, first
click the Move tool shown in the margin. Then hold down your right mouse
button anywhere in the selection area and drag to move the outline elsewhere.
206
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

Adding to or subtracting 
from your selection
You can use the selection tools to add to or remove from your selection. You
can add any area at all, using any selection tool — not just the one you used
to create the selection — to do any of the following:
 Add or subtract areas around the edge of your selection. You can add
cousin Alma’s hat to a selection of her head, for instance, or remove it
(the hat selection, not her head).
 Select multiple, isolated areas throughout the image. You can select all
the buttons on your product, for instance.
 Remove isolated areas from the selection. For example, you can remove
a policeman’s buttons from a selection of his uniform.
 Use the same tool you used for the initial selection, and also use any of
the other selection tools. Although you may have used Smart Edge to
select Alex’s head, you can add the carpet at the bottom with the Magic
Wand tool.
Performing the addition or subtraction is simple as, well, arithmetic — simpler,
even. Do either of the following:
 To add areas to an existing selection: Hold down the Shift key and, with
any selection tool, make a new selection outside of (or overlapping) the
original selection. A + sign appears next to the tool’s cursor to remind
you that you’re adding.
 To subtract areas from an existing selection: Hold down the Ctrl key
and make a selection within (or overlapping) the original selection. 
A – sign attaches itself to the selection tool’s cursor.
Here’s an example. In Figure 12-7, we originally clicked with the Magic Wand
tool on the blue clothing worn by Dave’s wife, Katy, using Brightness for the
match mode. (We chose Brightness over Hue because the contrast in bright-
ness between dark blue clothing and white snow was stronger than the uni-
formity of the blue.) The selection extended over to sled dog Starr’s darker
markings, however, which we didn’t want.
To remove Starr from this selection, we held down the Ctrl key and used the
Freehand tool (set to the Freehand selection type) to draw a loop around
Starr. Figure 12-7 shows this loop nearing completion. Note the – sign near
the lasso cursor, indicating subtraction. When we released the mouse button,
Paint Shop Pro completed the loop and subtracted Starr from the selection.
We could just as easily have used the Selection tool and (with the Ctrl key
pressed) dragged an elliptical selection around Starr. In real life, Starr was
never this easy to lasso.
207
Chapter 12: Selecting Parts of an Image

Expanding and contracting by pixels
Expanding or contracting a selection in Paint Shop Pro simply means adding
or removing a set of pixels around the edge of the selection area. It’s like
packing snow onto a snowman or melting it away. You can expand or con-
tract a selection by as many snowflakes . . . er, pixels as you like.
Choose Selections➪Modify➪Expand or Selections➪Modify➪Contract. The
simple-looking Expand Selection, or Contract Selection, dialog box appears.
Set the Number of Pixels control to however many pixels you want to add or
remove and click OK.
Removing specks and holes
If you have most of your image selected but it’s still got some holes you want
to fill in, you can tell Paint Shop Pro to extend its selection to cover any gaps
under a certain size. Specks are any small flecks that lie outside of the main
body of the selection, whereas holes are flecks inside the selection.
After you have your area selected, choose the Selections➪Modify➪
Remove Specks and Holes option. You’re presented with an options dialog
box, as shown in Figure 12-8, that asks you the maximum size of the speck or
hole to be filled in (as measured in pixels, the smallest element of the picture
that can be measured). The numbers in the dialog box are a bit confusing,
Figure 12-7:

208
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

but think of it as a multiplication project: In this setting, because the left
number is set to 70 and the right menu is set to 100, any speck or hole
smaller than 7,000 pixels is filled in with a selection. You can choose to fill
in gaps as small as 1 x 1 (one pixel, obviously) or as large as 100 x 1,000,000 
(100 million pixels), which is larger than most people’s pictures!
As you can see, the holes in Alex’s interior get filled in, but it doesn’t expand
it out along the border. The danger is that if you select too wide an area, Paint
Shop Pro may well decide that your entire selection is one huge gap and
erase it.
Selecting similar areas
Selecting all the areas of similar color throughout an image is a pain to do man-
ually. You have to find each spot of similar color and click it with the Magic
Wand tool. Paint Shop Pro offers an automatic version of that same task.
First, use any selection tool to select one area. Then choose Selections➪
Modify➪Select Similar. Paint Shop Pro selects all pixels similar to the colors
within your selection.
Figure 12-8:

filled in.
209
Chapter 12: Selecting Parts of an Image

How similar? The Select Similar command looks to the Magic Wand tool’s
Tolerance control to determine how similar to the original color a selected
pixel should be. A high tolerance means that a color can be significantly dif-
ferent and still be selected; a low tolerance selects only colors very close to
those in your original selection.
A difference between the Magic Wand tool and the Select Similar command
is that it asks whether you want to select an area contiguously. A contiguous
Select Similar action only adds areas that are right next to the current selec-
tion; discontiguous selections add parts from all over your image, regardless
of where they are.
You can also add or remove selections based on how close they are to certain
colors. For example, if you’re trying to cut and paste The Artist Formerly
Known As Prince Who Is Back to Being Called Prince Again, who is known
for wearing purple outfits, you might want to expand your selection to only
lavender areas. Choose Selections➪Modify➪Select Color Range and choose
a nice shade of magenta in the color box.
If you’re selecting areas of a particular color because you intend to change
that color throughout the image, consider using the Color Replacer tool
instead. Refer to Chapter 4 for instructions.
Sometimes, you don’t really want all the pixels of similar color — just those
within a certain region of the image. Fussy, fussy. For instance, you may want
all the sky, including that which peeks through the tree branches, but not the
similarly colored pond, thank you. No problem. Just draw a freehand selec-
tion around the pond while pressing the Ctrl key to subtract that area.
Feathering for More Gradual Edges
When you copy or modify selected areas, you may notice that the edge
between the selection and the background becomes artificially obvious. To
keep a natural-looking edge on these types of objects, use feathering in your
selection.
Feathering creates a blending zone of several pixels (however many you
choose) extending both into and out of your selection. Whatever change you
make to the selected area fades gradually within that zone, from 100 percent
at the inner edge to 0 percent at the outer edge of the zone. For instance, if
you were to increase the brightness of the selected area, that increase fades
gradually to 0 at the outer edge of the feathered zone. If you delete, copy, cut,
or move a feathered selection, you also leave a feathered edge behind.
210
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

You can apply feathering in either of two ways:
 Before making the selection: On the Tool Options palette for whatever
selection tool you’re using, set the Feather value to something greater
than zero. When you next make a selection, the feathering is applied and
the marquee’s enclosed area expands to include the outer feathered
pixels.
 After making the selection: Choose Selections➪Modify➪Feather and
the Feather Selection dialog box appears. Set the Number of Pixels value
in that dialog box to the number of pixels you want the selection feath-
ered, and then click OK. The area within the selection marquee expands.
The value you set in the Feather control tells Paint Shop Pro how wide to
make the feather zone — how many pixels to extend it into, and out of, the
selection. (A setting of 4, for instance, creates a feathered zone 4 pixels into
and 4 pixels out from the edge of the selection, for a total of 8 pixels wide.) A
larger value makes a wider, more gradually feathered edge. When you feather,
the marquee expands to include the pixels that are in the feathering zone.
If feathering in all directions is too clumsy for you, you can choose to feather
the edge in one direction only, either into the interior of the selection or
feathering out beyond its borders. Choose the Selections➪Modify➪
Inside/Outside Feather option to display a dialog box that offers exactly the
same pixel control of the regular Feather control, except that you get to
choose which way you feather.
Figure 12-9 shows the difference feathering makes. Normally, Alex is fairly
fuzzy around the edges anyway. Feathering makes his edges even fuzzier.
From left to right, this is the same image copied without feathering, with
feathering in all directions, with inside-only feathering, and with outside-only
feathering.

211
Chapter 12: Selecting Parts of an Image

When you copy or move a feathered selection, you bring along a faint
border — feathered copies of the original background pixels surrounding
the selection. The image on the far right in Figure 12-9 shows some door
background, for instance.
You can defeather your image by choosing Selections➪Modify➪Unfeather;
unfortunately, this command is not like the friendly Undo button, where it
magically undoes any feathering you have added. Instead, this command dis-
plays a dialog box in which you can set the threshold of how harshly you want
to strip any fuzziness from the edges of your selection; a low threshold gives
your selection a light shave, whereas a high threshold reduces your selection
to a stick-like skeleton of itself.
Because feathering a selection expands the marquee, it gives the appearance
of filling in holes in a selection (adding them entirely to the selection). It
doesn’t really add those holes entirely to the selection, however; the pixels
in them are simply feathered. As a result, if you feather a selection that has
holes in it and then cut, delete, or move it, you leave behind faint images of
those holes. If your selection has holes, try removing specks and holes or
smoothing the selection before you feather it.
Antialiasing for Smoother Edges
Because computer images are made up of tiny squares (the pixels), when a
straight edge of a selection is anything other than perfectly horizontal or verti-
cal, those squares give the edge a microscopic staircase, or sawtooth, shape
known as aliasing. Any changes you make to the selected area, or any cutting
or pasting of the selection, may make that aliasing objectionably obvious.
To avoid aliasing when you next make a selection, click to enable the
Antialias check box on the Tool Options palette for your selection tool.
Antialiasing is available only for the Freehand tools, not the Magic Wand or
the Selection tool. (You can use feathering to reduce most aliasing problems.)
The antialiasing option, like other settings on the Tool Options palette,
applies to only selections you make after choosing that option, not to a 
current selection. You can’t fix an existing aliased selection by clicking that
option.
Selecting All, None, or Everything But
Sometimes you want a selection to be an all-or-nothing proposition! To select
the entire image, press Ctrl+A or choose Selections➪Select All.
212
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

To select none (also known as clearing the selection or deselecting), press
Ctrl+D or choose Selections➪Select None. You can also clear selections (except
when the entire image is selected) by right-clicking anywhere on the image.
Sometimes you may want to select everything but the part of the image that is
not selected. This process is known as inverting the selection. To perform it,
choose Selections➪Invert or press Ctrl+Shift+I.
Selecting Alex, and Only Alex
So you have a problem: Your dog (the one in our example is named Alex) is
sick of the snow. Sure, you could send him to a tropical paradise, but you
have decided that it’s much simpler to select him so that you can cut and
paste him into a picture of the Caribbean. Then you show him the picture
and tell him that he was just in the tropics last week.
The genius of dogs is that they require surprisingly little evidence to believe
anything you tell them. So how do you do the transfer?
1. Select the Magic Wand tool from the Selection toolset.
Because you’re trying to select Alex and he is the only really brown
thing in the picture, set the Magic Wand tool options to a match mode
of Color.
2. Set the tolerance of the Magic Wand.
Here’s the trick: Even we hardened professional Paint Shop Pro experts
(we’re writing a book on it, aren’t we?) are never sure what number to use
for tolerance — like everyone else, we guess.
213
Chapter 12: Selecting Parts of an Image
The easiest way to select complex shapes
Selecting everything but and then inverting is a
useful trick when you may have a complex object
on a comparatively uniform background. Rather
than spend lots of effort selecting the object, you
can more easily select the uniform background
with the Magic Wand tool and then, by pressing
Ctrl+Shift+I, invert the selection (which selects
the complex object). It doesn’t work if the back-
ground is complex, but you would be surprised
at how much time you can save.
However, if you do have a complex background,
you can use the Background Eraser to clear a
“moat” of transparent space around the shape
you want selected and then switch to the regu-
lar Eraser tool to remove everything outside that
moat. Then use the Magic Wand to select the
transparent space around your image and
invert it.

We guess 100, which, as you can see in Figure 12-10, turns out to be way
too much. Right-click to clear the selection and try again. A little experi-
menting with the tolerance shows you that 25 tolerance is a solid start-
ing point.
3. Shift-click a few stray selections to clean up the edges.
The Magic Wand selected most of this cuddly retriever, but Alex’s ear,
the underside of his left foot, and his right rear foot are still not selected.
Those are also the areas where the color tends to vary a little more
wildly, shifting from almost black to light green, so set the tolerance a
little higher, to 50, for example — and then Shift+click in these areas to
add those places to your selection. As you can see in Figure 12-11, that
action adds the ears and feet, but also adds unwanted portions of the
door to your selection.

4. Fill in the small gaps.
Choose Selections➪Modify➪Remove Specks and Holes and set it to 70 x
100 pixels, which automatically chooses any gap smaller than 700 pixels.
Look back at Figure 12-8 to see the clear difference; click OK.
5. Ctrl+click the door away.
Although you can do some fancy shenanigans with the Select Color
Range option to remove that pesky door, you have a simpler solution:
Because it’s all in one place, you can just Ctrl+select it away. Remember:
Shift+select adds to your existing selection, whereas Ctrl+select sub-
tracts it. In this case, you switch to the Freehand tool, hold down Ctrl,
and draw a ring around the door to remove it.
6. Feather the edges.
Now the edges are crisp — too crisp, as you can see in Figure 12-12. A
little feathering makes it softer and blends it in with any background in
which you paste it. Choose Selections➪Modify➪Inside/Outside Feather
and opt to feather the inside of the selection by two pixels.
Avoiding Selection Problems
in Layered Images
Layered images can cause both the selection and the editing of those selec-
tions to go apparently screwy. The Magic Wand tool and Smart Edge features
may appear neither magic nor smart, selecting areas not at all like you had in
mind. Also, whatever changes you try to perform to the selected area (such as
cutting, copying, or changing color) may apparently not take place. (If you’re
not sure whether your image has layers, see Chapter 14.)
The basic trick is to work on the right layer. Here are some more detailed
rules you can follow to keep the selection and editing process relatively sane:

Chapter 12: Selecting Parts of an Image

 Activate the right layer: Before you make any changes to a selected
area (no matter which selection tool you have used to create it), make
sure to activate the layer you want to change. You can’t change all the
layers within a selection at one time — only one layer at a time. You can
merge all the layers (see Chapter 14) before making your change, but
then you no longer have layers!
 Use Sample Merged for combined layers: Before you make a selection
with the Magic Wand tool or Smart Edge feature, if the object you’re
trying to select is the result of various layers combined, enable the
Sample Merged check box on the Tool Options palette. That way, the
Magic Wand tool or Smart Edge feature examines the combined effect,
not just the active layer. For instance, if you added a party hat to Uncle
Charley’s head on a separate layer and now you want to select Charley-
with-hat using the Smart Edge feature, you would use Sample Merged.
 Consider the effect of higher layers: If the changes you try to make to
a selected area aren’t visible or seem only partially effective, a higher
opaque or transparent layer may contain pixels that are obscuring your
work. You may have to merge layers, make your changes to the higher,
obscuring layer, or rethink your use of layers altogether.
Paint Shop Pro helps keep you sane. The preview window that certain adjust-
ments provide (such as Brightness/Contrast) shows only the area you’re
affecting: the selected part of the active layer. If the wrong layer is active, you
don’t see the area you’re expecting!
When you make a selection, it extends to all layers — no matter which one is
active at the time. Changes to selected image areas, however (like painting),
affect only the active layer. So you can activate one layer, for example, to
make a selection with the Magic Wand tool and then switch to another layer
to make changes within that selected area.

I
n Chapter 12, we tell you how to identify a chunk of your image to Paint
Shop Pro by creating a selection. In this chapter, you see how to move,
copy, twist, and deform these selections — in short, how to do almost any-
thing that changes the physical location or outline of a selection. (You may
also rotate, flip, or mirror a selection, but you have to go to Chapter 11 for
those tricks.)
Before you get rolling, take these notes to heart and staple them there:
 The instructions in this chapter assume that you know how to make
selections. If you don’t know how, refer to Chapter 12.
 A selection is a selected portion of the image, not the selection marquee
(moving dashed line).
 If your image has multiple layers, make sure that you’re on the right
layer to move, copy, float, or delete the image you want. See Chapter 14
for help with layers.
 You can press Ctrl+Z to undo any changes you make. The changes you
can undo include selecting, floating, moving, copying, pasting, or
defloating. Refer to Chapter 1 for more information about undoing.
 The instructions in this chapter deal only with image chunks that are
made out of dots (called raster, or bitmap, images). Those selections are
the kinds we describe in Chapter 12 and that you make with the Selection,
Freehand, or Magic Wand tools. To deal with vector selections (typically
text, lines, and geometric shapes), see Chapter 15.

Floating, Moving, and
Deleting Selections
After you have made a selection, you can easily move it anywhere within
your image, move a copy of it, or delete it altogether. Here’s how to do it:
 To move a selection: Choose any selection tool (Selection, Freehand, 
or Magic Wand), if you haven’t already, and then drag the selection.
Selection tool cursors become four-headed move arrows when you posi-
tion them over a selection, as Figure 13-1 shows. On the Background
(main) image layer, dragging a selection in this way leaves behind back-
ground color. The image on the left in Figure 13-1 shows the effect.
 To float a selection (make it moveable): A floating selection simply
means a moveable one. You can float a selection in one of two ways.
When you click an existing selection with a selection tool (as though to
move the selection), that selection is floated automatically. Alternatively,
you can choose Selections➪Float or press Ctrl+F. Floating a selection in
that way (manually) leaves a copy of it behind. (Note that any floating
selection also appears on the layer palette.)
 To move a selection and leave a copy behind (as the right side of
Figure 14-1 shows): Float the selection manually first (choose
Selections➪Float or press Ctrl+F) and then move it with the Mover tool
(the four-headed arrow) or any selection tool.
Float, then drag to move a copy

Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

 To defloat the floating selection (or glue it back down): To defloat a
selection, press Ctrl+Shift+F or choose Selections➪Defloat. You can also
deselect (press Ctrl+D) to defloat. The defloating command leaves the
area selected in case you want to do additional work on it. Whichever
way you defloat the image, defloating glues the image down. It’s now
part of the underlying image (or image layer), and its pixels replace
whatever was there. If you move the selection again, you find that the
original underlying pixels are no longer there.
 To delete the selection: Press the Delete key on your keyboard. If the
image has only one layer (or the Background layer is the active one in a
multilayer image), the Paint Shop Pro background color appears in the
deleted area. If the selection is on a layer, the pixels within it simply go
away. (Okay, technically, they’re made transparent — same thing.)
 To move a floating selection to another layer: Drag the Floating Selection
layer up or down on the Layer palette. Leave the selection immediately
above the layer you ultimately want the selection to join. When you
defloat the selection, it joins the closest underlying (raster) layer.
You can also flip or mirror a selection. Refer to Chapter 11 for information on
using the Flip and Mirror commands. Both commands leave a copy of the
original image underlying the selection.
Cutting, Copying, and Pasting
from the Windows Clipboard
To make lots of copies of a selection, use the conventional cut, copy, and
paste features that employ the Windows Clipboard. You can use these fea-
tures for copying selections to or from other Windows applications too
because nearly all Windows applications make use of the Clipboard.
If your image has multiple layers, first make sure that you have selected the
right layer to cut, copy, or paste the image you want. Click the layer’s name
on the Layer palette. (Press F8 if the palette isn’t visible). See Chapter 14 for
more help with layers.
Cutting and copying
In Paint Shop Pro, cut and copy work much the same as they do in any Windows
program. First, select an area in your image. Then, do any of these tasks:
219
Chapter 13: Moving, Copying, and Reshaping Parts of Your Image

 Cut a selection: Press Ctrl+X, choose Edit➪Cut, or click the familiar
Windows Cut button (scissors icon) on the Paint Shop Pro toolbar. Paint
Shop Pro places a copy of the selected area on the Windows Clipboard.
If you’re cutting on the main (Background) layer of the image, Paint Shop
Pro fills the cut area with the current background color on the color
palette. On other layers, it leaves behind transparency.
 Copy a selection: Press Ctrl+C, choose Edit➪Copy, or click the Copy
button (two-documents icon) on the Paint Shop Pro toolbar. Paint Shop
Pro puts a copy of the selected area (of the active layer) on the Windows
Clipboard. Nothing happens to your image.
 Copy a selection on a multilayer image: The normal Edit➪Copy com-
mand copies only from the active layer. If your image is made up of mul-
tiple layers, you may want to copy the combined effect of all layers. If so,
choose Edit➪Copy Merged (or press Ctrl+Shift+C).
 Cut or copy from other applications: Most Windows applications offer
the same Edit➪Copy and Edit➪Cut commands, so you can place text or
graphics on the Windows Clipboard. Paint Shop Pro enables you to
paste a wide variety of Clipboard content from other programs, such as
text, vector graphics, or raster graphics.
Pasting
After your selection is on the Windows Clipboard, choose Edit➪Paste to
paste it into Paint Shop Pro (or nearly any other application). When you
choose Edit➪Paste in Paint Shop Pro, however, you get several different
paste options, which we describe briefly in this list and in more detail in the
following sections:
 As New Image (Ctrl+V): The Clipboard contents become a whole new
image, in its own window.
 As New Layer (Ctrl+L): The Clipboard contents become a new layer for
the current image. See Chapter 14 for a discussion of layers.
 As New Selection (Ctrl+E): Clipboard contents become a floating selec-
tion that you can place anywhere on the image (on the active layer.)
 As Transparent Selection (Ctrl+Shift+E): This is the same thing as the
option named As New Selection, except that this time the background
color of the current image is subtracted from the selection. We find this
option to be kind of limited, and we suggest that you use the Select Color
Range to get rid of a color entirely, as shown later in this chapter, in the
section “Removing the background or other colors from your selection.”
 Into Selection (Ctrl+Shift+L): If you have a selected area in your image,
this choice fits the Clipboard contents exactly into the selection, scaling
the contents up or down as needed.
220
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

If you’re in the habit of using Ctrl+V for editing in other programs, you
need to retrain yourself. In Paint Shop Pro, Ctrl+V creates a new image
rather than pastes your selection to the existing image, which is what
you probably expect to happen.
Here’s one paste selection we cover elsewhere in this book:
 As New Vector Selection: This command is used for pasting text and
shapes you created using the Paint Shop Pro text and shape tools. For
more about vectors, see Chapter 14.
If you copy vector graphics from outside Paint Shop Pro (for instance,
objects drawn using computer-aided design software, drawing programs,
or Microsoft Word’s draw feature), Paint Shop Pro converts them to raster
graphics when you paste. Paint Shop Pro pops up a Meta Picture Import
dialog box in which you can enter either height or width in pixels to deter-
mine the image’s size. To enter height and width values independently, clear
the Maintain Original Aspect Ratio check box.
Pasting to create a new picture:
As New Image
The paste As New Image option creates a new image containing the Clipboard
contents. The image is just big enough to contain whatever is on the Clipboard.
The background of the image is transparent, which means that if your copied
selection isn’t rectangular, you see transparent areas; erasing also leaves
transparency behind.
Choose Edit➪Paste➪As New Image or press Ctrl+V (the nearly universal key-
board command for Paste). Your new image appears in a new window.
If you prefer your new image to have a background color or to be slightly larger
than the contents of the Clipboard, create the new image first, separately (refer
to Chapter 1). Then paste a selection or new layer rather than use the Paste As
New Image command.
Pasting on an existing image:
As New Selection
The Paste As New Selection option pastes the Clipboard contents as a float-
ing selection on your image. This pasting option is the one most people want
for editing an image because it is the simplest and most intuitive.
221
Chapter 13: Moving, Copying, and Reshaping Parts of Your Image

If your image uses multiple layers, make sure to first activate the layer where
you want to paste (refer to Chapter 14).
Choose Edit➪Paste➪As New Selection or press Ctrl+E. A floating selection
appears on your image. In the example shown in Figure 13-2, the selection on
the right had all the black removed from it, but a small, ugly halo of grayness
remains; the figure on the left had the black color range subtracted from it
and looks much cleaner.
Because the selection is floating, you drag the selection to move it anywhere
in the image. To defloat the selection (paste it down on the underlying layer),
press Ctrl+Shift+F. See the earlier section “Floating, Moving, and Deleting
Selections,” for details about moving and defloating a floating selection.
Pasting for maximum flexibility:
As New Layer
Pasting directly on another image is fine, as far as it goes. For maximum flexibil-
ity in making future changes, however, paste on a new layer instead. When an
image is on a layer, you can modify it to your heart’s content without worrying
about surrounding or underlying image areas. (In Chapter 14, we discuss the
whys and hows of layers in detail.) Here’s how:
1. If your image already has more than one layer, activate (choose) the
layer above which you want the new layer to appear.
For instance, click the layer on the Layer palette to activate it. See
Chapter 14 for more details on activating layers.
Figure 13-2:
Close, but
not quite.
222
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

2. Choose Edit➪Paste➪As New Layer (or press Ctrl+L).
Your pasted image appears on a layer of its own.
If the background of the image you pasted was transparent, the underlying
image layer shows through those background areas. Otherwise, the pasted
image and its background color fill an opaque rectangle. If you want to delete
the background (make it transparent), use the Magic Wand tool, or another
selection tool, to select it (refer to Chapter 12) and press the Delete key on
your keyboard. Alternatively, see the following section.
Removing the background or other
colors from your selection
Sometimes you want to be rid of the background behind a selection you have
moved or pasted. Often, for instance, a pasted object has a solid white or other
colored background — perhaps because you copied and pasted it from the
Web. Often, the background may not be perfectly uniform; a tree you moved
may bring along some bluish sky around its edge, or a baby may bring along a
white blanket with gray folds. You do not, however, want the sky or blanket in
the new location. Perhaps you’re trying to copy the baby to a photo of a hay-
filled manger with sheep looking on adoringly — or hungrily, which is easier,
given the hay.
One solution is to make the background color transparent, if it’s fairly uniform.
(If that color appears elsewhere in the image, however, you may get unwanted
transparent holes; you can then use the Remove Specks and Holes command
to get rid of them, as outlined in Chapter 12.)
With the area you’re trying to affect selected in your image, follow these steps:
1. Choose Selections➪Modify➪Select Color Range.
This step brings up the Select Color Range dialog box, as shown in
Figure 13-3.
2. Click the Reference Color swatch.
This step brings the Color dialog box, but you can safely ignore it;
instead, click on your image, in the area that has the color you want
removed. Click OK.
3. Select Subtract Color Range.
4. Set the Tolerance value to something higher than zero.
We know that this instruction is vague, but only experience or trial-and-
error can really guide you in this setting. Try a value of 10 to 20 to begin
with, if in doubt.
223
Chapter 13: Moving, Copying, and Reshaping Parts of Your Image

What this does is make transparent any pixel of the color you have
chosen, or of a similar color. Low tolerance values remove colors that
are almost exactly like your chosen color; higher tolerance values begin
to wipe wider ranges of color.
For example, if you chose a baby blue and use a 1 tolerance, only that
precise shade of blue is removed; at a 256 tolerance, Paint Shop Pro
begins removing dark purples and light browns in addition to all blue
shades within the selection.
5. Look at your selection to double-check that it has no ugly fringe.
If you can see the nonselected areas of your image, clicking the Toggle
Selection button to hide them makes this step much easier.
6. Click OK.
If the process makes too many or too few pixels transparent, repeat
these steps to choose a new tolerance in Step 4, or choose a different
background color in Step 1. To make more pixels transparent, increase
the tolerance value in Step 4; for fewer transparent pixels, decrease the
tolerance.
You can repeat this process as often as you want, removing color after color.

Tips for natural-looking pastes
People frequently use the cut-and-paste feature to put objects in other
places; for example, in Figure 13-4, we have cut the faithful Alex out of Dave’s
snow-covered doorstep and placed him next to Amy, William’s daughter, as
she kneels next to her fantastic creation: the Snowduck.
This part of the program is a great deal of fun, and Paint Shop Pro aficionados
frequently get hours of enjoyment by inserting themselves into movie
posters so that they’re costarring with Salma Hayek. In fact, an entire under-
ground Internet movement is devoted to taking pictures from the news and
doing as many strange and bizarre things with them as possible. The Web site
www.fark.com, for example, holds PG-13-rated contests to see who can
“Photoshop” pictures of Alan Greenspan and Ludacris into the funniest
places. Some results are quite impressive.
But the problem is that cut-and-paste operations frequently look completely
unnatural. Not that you need your photos to hold up to the eye of conspiracy
theorists — everyone knows that they’re fake, after all — but plopping a pic-
ture of you, jaggies and edge halos and all, into some random image just
looks amateurish.
With that in mind, we here at the Paint Shop Pro 8 For Dummies staff offer the
following advice to make your images blend seamlessly:
1. Use the Magic Wand to select.
Yes, it’s easier to just draw a line around your target — but unless you
have a steady hand and a ridiculously exacting eye, the Magic Wand does
it better after some fine-tuning. Get used to it.
Figure 13-4:
Paint 
Shop Pro:

people (and
animals)
together.
225
Chapter 13: Moving, Copying, and Reshaping Parts of Your Image

2. Get rid of the holes and specks in your selection.
This task used to be a difficult, but Paint Shop Pro makes it so easy now
with its Remove Specks and Holes command that it’s a crime not to do it.
3. Feather a little.
Usually, you want to leave off those crisp edges. Feather one or two
pixels on the inside to help the selection blend into the background.
4. Eliminate the background color entirely.
We show you how to do this step in the section “Removing the back-
ground or other colors from your selection,” earlier in this chapter.
Figure 13-2 shows you what happens if you don’t. Learn the lesson!
5. Resize appropriately.
When we first put Alex in the picture in Figure 13-4, he only came up to
Amy’s shoulder, making Amy look freakishly huge. A little upsizing made
a large difference.
6. Match the blur.
Most photos aren’t perfectly clear, and dropping a crisply focused image
into the middle of a slightly blurry pic looks wrong in a way that most
people can’t quite put a name to. Sharpening or Gaussian-blurring your
selection just a tad helps it to blend in.
7. Adjust the color.
Having a sunlit image brought into a fluorescent background makes the
image stick out like a throbbing thumb. Adjust the contrast, hue, and
brightness to match it as close as you can.
8. Don’t forget the shadows!
A touch of low-opacity black paint can serve as a quick-and-dirty fake
shadow — as we did in the example shown in Figure 13-4. If you want to
go all out, you can even paste in another identical selection as a layer,
deform it so that it’s twisted sideways and elongated like a real shadow,
position it so that it’s spreading out from the bottom of the image, erase
the layer so that it’s transparent — and then fill it in with low-opacity
paint. But that’s a great deal of work for a quick fake!
Resizing, Rotating, Deforming,
and Perspective-izing
Okay, so perspective-izing isn’t a real word. Perspecting? In any event, you
can resize, rotate, deform, or move your selection by using the Deform tool
from the Deformation toolset, as shown in Figure 13-5.
226
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

Making a shape look as though it’s seen in perspective is one of the cool
kinds of deformation you can do. You can make a rectangular area, for
instance, look like a wall or road receding into the distance. You can paint a
railroad track running vertically, flat, as though it’s on a map, and then make
it lie down realistically by applying perspective.
Preparing for deformation
The Deform tool is picky: it needs a separate layer (other than the background
layer) to work with. If you’re trying to deform a selection, Paint Shop Pro asks
you whether it’s okay to promote that selection to a layer. (See Chapter 19 if
you want Paint Shop Pro to do this automatically, without asking you.)
However, you can move the selection to its own layer yourself by choosing
Selections➪Promote to Layer or press Ctrl+Shift+P. For more about layers,
see Chapter 14.
The Deformation tool works on the active layer, encompassing all the non-
transparent areas in that layer. In other words, if you have a blob of pixels on
a layer, the tool encompasses (rather neatly, in our opinion) just that blob. If
you have multiple blobs separated by transparency, it encompasses all blobs.

227
Chapter 13: Moving, Copying, and Reshaping Parts of Your Image

Doing the deformation
The easy and fairly intuitive way to make the deformation is by dragging vari-
ous parts of the deformation grid with the Deformation tool. See “Deforming
by dragging,” coming up next.
The geeky, but precise, way to do the deformation is with the Deformation
Settings dialog box. See “Deforming by dialog box,” a bit later in this chapter.
Deforming by dragging
Select the Deformation tool from the Deformation toolset (if it’s grayed out,
refer to the earlier section “Preparing for deformation” for instructions), and
your cursor turns into that icon. Click your selection to get this cool-looking
deformation grid with tiny squares (called handles) on it, as Figure 13-6 shows.
This figure shows you what to drag for resizing, rotating, or moving the
image. Note that you can move the selection with this tool by dragging any-
where except on one of the handles. (In areas where dragging is possible, the
cursor changes to a four-way arrow.) Here’s how to do various operations,
using the handles of the deformation grid:
 Resizing or repositioning sides: Adjust width and height by dragging
the handle in the center of any side. Drag corner handles to change both
height and width at the same time. (The Deformation tool provides no
way to automatically keep the proportions constant while you drag, so
see the following section for help.)
 Rotating: Drag the handle, marked “Rotation handle” in Figure 13-7, in a
circular motion around the center of the grid. (When your cursor is over
the rotation handle, the cursor depicts the pair of curved arrows shown
Resizing handles
Drag anywhere inside grid to move selection

Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

in the figure. The center of rotation is marked by a square that is at the
face’s nose.) Only the grid rotates until you release the mouse button;
then the selection rotates.
 Adding perspective: In the real world, the farther away an object is, the
smaller it appears to your eye. Here’s how to create that illusion with
your selection so that one end looks farther away:
• To shrink any side of the selection as though it were farther away,
first hold down the Ctrl key. With that key down, drag one of the
two corner handles that terminate the side; drag toward the center
of that side. To expand the side, drag away from the center. The
side shrinks or expands symmetrically about the center (both cor-
ners move). The perspective this distortion creates is as though
your eyes were level with the middle of the selection, as the left
side of Figure 13-8 shows.
• To shrink or expand any side asymmetrically (move one corner
only), first hold down the Shift key. With that key down, drag a
corner handle toward or away from the center handle of that side.
When you apply this effect to the left or right side, as shown on the
right in Figure 13-8, the result is as though your eyes were at a level
above or below center. For instance, to get the illusion of a tall
wall, drag the upper corner down.

229
Chapter 13: Moving, Copying, and Reshaping Parts of Your Image

For a different way to apply simple perspective that doesn’t involve as
much head scratching, try the Paint Shop Pro Perspective effect. Choose
Effects➪Geometric Effects➪Perspective Horizontal or Perspective
Vertical. Refer to Chapter 8 for help with effect dialog boxes.
 Shear (or skew) distortion: We got the shear effect of Figure 13-9 by
dragging the right side of the selection down. To drag a side of your
selection, hold down either the Ctrl or Shift key and drag the center
handle on the side you want to move.
Shear is useful for perspective when you want the virtual horizon (the vanish-
ing point, in drafting terms) to be higher or lower than dead center. Apply
perspective distortion to shrink a left or right side first, and then use shear to
drag one of those sides up or down. Dragging down, for instance, makes the
image appear as it would if a viewer were looking up slightly (it lowers the
horizon).
Deforming by dialog box
Dragging handles is convenient and intuitive, but not particularly precise.
What if you know that you need to rotate something 31.5 degrees, for
instance? Or scale it down to 85 percent of its original dimensions?
Press F4 to bring up the Tool Options palette, and you can type the settings
you want. It provides a column for X, or horizontal values, and Y, or vertical
values, and rows for each of the various changes that the Deformation tool
can make. Here’s how to choose the values you need:

Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

 Position: To move the selection, enter the X and Y coordinates where
you want the upper-left corner of the deformation grid to go. (Remember
that X and Y both equal 0 at the upper-right corner of the image.)
 Scale: Enter X and Y scale factors. Enter 80 in the X% scale box, for
instance, to reduce the horizontal size of the selection to 80 percent of
original. To keep the original proportions, put the same value in both the
X and Y columns.
 Shear: To slide the top edge to the right, enter a positive value; enter a
negative value to move the edge the other way.
 Perspective: To make the right edge appear to recede into the distance
by pulling the upper-right corner down and inward, enter a positive
number in the Perspective X box. To make the top edge appear to
recede, do likewise in the Y box. Use negative values to make those
same edges appear to approach the viewer instead.
 Pivot: Normally, when you rotate a selection or layer, it rotates around
the center. If you want your image to revolve around a different point —
around the upper-left corner of the selection, for example, or even
around a point that’s outside the selection entirely — adjust the pivot
values. The numbers in the X and Y boxes vary, but unless you have
changed the pivot in the past, those numbers are the exact center of the
image. Lower X numbers move the pivot to the left, whereas higher Xs
shift it right; lower Y numbers move the pivot up, and higher numbers
drop it down.
 Angle: To rotate the selection clockwise, enter a positive number of
degrees (45, for example) into the text box. Use a negative value for
counterclockwise.

Chapter 13: Moving, Copying, and Reshaping Parts of Your Image

Other handy deformities
You should know about three other tools in the Deform toolset:
 Mesh Warp: Using this tool covers your image with a grid of warp
points; you can click and drag each of these points to deform your image
in specific ways, as you can see in Figure 13-10.
In the left picture, the grid is untouched; in the right, however, we have
moved the warp points around, and the image has stretched itself to fit
the new warp points. (You can control the number of warp points by
changing the Mesh Horizontal and Mesh Vertical controls on the Tool
Options palette; larger values mean more points. As usual, press F4 if
you don’t see the Tool Options palette.)
You can accomplish some mighty strange effects with this feature, given
time and lots of patience; the most common use is to warp an existing
image to fit on another image’s contour.
 Straighten: Did you ever spend an afternoon hanging paintings, taking
painstaking care to ensure that the bottom edges of the frames were all
perfectly parallel with the floor? This tool is an automatic picture-
adjuster. Most images are at least a little tilted when they’re scanned in,
so we discuss this tool in Chapter 2, in the section about scanning into
Paint Shop Pro.
232
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 
Deformation consternations
The Deformation tool can occasionally wrinkle
your brow with certain weirdnesses. Here are a
few typical problems and solutions:
The tool encompasses the wrong area: You
probably have the wrong layer active. Here’s
what happens: If you’re on a layer that’s trans-
parent in the selected area, the Deformation
tool chooses the nontransparent area instead.
Press the F8 key to open the Layer palette and
click the layer that contains the image you want.
You can’t find the deformation grid; you see
only two squares and a connecting line: The
grid is there, all right, but you have applied the
Deformation tool to a layer or selection that
covers the entire image. Change layers or make
a new selection.
An annoying background appears in the area
the selection outline has vacated: Well, Paint
Shop Pro has to put something there, and it can’t
invent a background image. (See “Preparing for
deformation,” earlier in this chapter, for more
information about backgrounds.) If Paint Shop
Pro could stretch the surrounding area to stay
continuous with your newly deformed selection,
that would be nice, but it isn’t so. Try dragging
your selection elsewhere or filling in the back-
ground with the Clone Brush tool (refer to
Chapter 5).

233
Chapter 13: Moving, Copying, and Reshaping Parts of Your Image
 Perspective Correction: This tool is the reverse of the deform tool; if
you have an image that’s already a little skewed or sheared, you can
use this tool to attempt to remove the skew or shear. Dragging the
Perspective tool around an image creates a box; you can then drag the
points on the edge of the box, just as you would with the Deformation
tool — but in this case you’re trying to re-create the shear or skew that’s
already present. When you’re done, double-click the image and Paint
Shop Pro attempts to remove the shear.

 Creating and working with layers

 Working with adjustment layers
 Creating and using vector layers
 Merging layers
T
he old masters of oil painting used layers of paint to give their paintings
great depth and radiance. Now, artistic masters (who all work in Paint
Shop Pro, of course) use layers for another reason: It makes changing stuff
lots easier. It also lets you combine images more easily.
Layers are like transparent sheets of plastic that are laid over an opaque
(nontransparent) background. You can put stuff on the background layer or
on the other, transparent layers.
As simple as this basic idea is, Paint Shop Pro uses it to give you lots of flexi-
bility and power in creating stunning images. To see what using layers can do
for you, read on!
Putting Layers to Work for You
With layers, you can paint, erase, or move things around without worrying
about ruining the underlying image. You can erase a line, for instance, with-
out erasing the background. You can move an entire object or see how some-
thing looks without permanently committing yourself to it. You can also
combine images in various clever ways.

Because Paint Shop Pro layers are electronic, not physical, they can make
your life easier in other ways, too. Here are just a few of the special tricks you
can do, besides simply painting, moving, combining, or erasing images:
 Select an object painted on a layer without accidentally selecting other
areas of the same color or that underlie that object.
 Make an image partly transparent, a sort of ghost on the background.
 Switch image objects into or out of the picture, as needed, or quickly
change their stacking order.
 Combine layers into one layer, if you’re certain that no more changes are
needed, or lock several layers together temporarily to form a movable
group of objects.
 Make vector layers, which enable you to create basic shapes, text, and
other objects in a special form that lets you easily change their shape.
 Make an adjustment layer (a brightening layer, for example) that affects
only the underlying layers and which effect you can vary.
 Create the frames of an animation by simply moving one or more layers.
 Make layers interact, for special effects. For instance, you can
subtract one layer from another — a way to reveal changes between
photographs.
Getting Layers
Your parents probably never explained where layers come from — unless, of
course, you grew up on an egg ranch. Here’s the real story.
You always have at least one layer: the background layer. That’s the layer
where nearly everything happens until you add more layers. If you download
a digital photo from your camera, for instance, the image is on the back-
ground layer. If you happily paint away, ignorant of all knowledge of layers, 
all your painting is on the background layer.
You can get images with additional layers in a variety of ways:
 Make a new, blank layer by using the various New commands on the
Layers menu (on the menu bar) or by using the Layer palette.
 Turn a selection into a layer (promote it, in Paint Shop Pro terms).
 Incidentally, make a new vector layer by drawing lines or shapes or by
adding text.
236
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

 Make a new raster layer by using a tool, like the Deformation tool, that
requires a layer to work on, and Paint Shop Pro creates one automati-
cally for you.
 Paste an image from the Windows Clipboard by choosing Edit➪Paste➪
As New Layer.
 Open an image file that already has multiple layers, such as many Paint
Shop Pro or Photoshop files have.
 Add a picture frame with the Image➪Picture Frame command.
Calling a Pal for Help: The Layer Palette
The first thing you should do when you’re working with layers is to call a
friend for help. The Layer palette, as shown in Figure 14-1, is your best pal.
It’s a small pal, hence the name palette. See how things make sense, after
they’re explained?
If it’s not on your screen already, call your little pal by pressing F8 on the key-
board or click the Toggle Layers button on the toolbar. Do the same thing to
hide the palette again.
One of the not-so-adorable Paint Shop Pro quirks is that sometimes it opens
the Layer palette so that the names of the layers (and, hence, the only way to
select a layer) are hidden. Your Layer palette should look like ours, with at
least the Background layer visible on the far left side; if it doesn’t, right-click
and drag the vertical bar immediately to the left of the Visibility toggle (the
little eye) and drag it rightward to reveal all.
Here are a few basic factoids to help you get along with your new and complex-
looking pal:
 Each row of the palette represents a layer. Your view of the image in
the image window is down through the layers, from top to bottom (back-
ground). The layers’ names are on the left side of the palette. You assign
names when you create the layers, or else you allow Paint Shop Pro to
create a boring but adequate name, like Layer3. Paint Shop Pro automati-
cally calls the initial, background layer (the one that every image starts
with) Background.
 To work on a layer, click its name. Clicking its name makes that layer
the active one. Nearly everything you can do to an image in Paint Shop
Pro, such as paint, erase, or fiddle with the colors, affects only the active
layer. The palette helps you remember which one is active.
237
Chapter 14: Layering Images

 The icon to the left of each row tells you what kind of layer that
row represents. Four kinds of layer exist: raster, vector, grouped,
or adjustment. You use raster layers most often. See the following side-
bar, “Choosing a layer that’s just your type,” for details. In Figure 14-1,
the rows named Pasted Alex, Sky, and Snow show you a raster icon,
the Lettering and Pentagon layers show the vector icon, the Brightness/
Contrast layer displays an adjustment icon, and Alex’s Background
shows the group icon.
Don’t bother trying to understand the palette all at once. We tell you how to
use the rest of the palette’s features as we go along.

Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

1. Choose where, in your stack of layers, you want the new layer to
appear.
(If this is the first layer you have added to an image, you can skip this
step. The new layer appears just above the background layer.)
Otherwise, on the Layer palette, click the layer that you want the new
layer to appear above. In Figure 14-1, for instance, we have clicked the
layer labeled Sky, making that layer the active one.
2. Click the New Layer button or choose Layers➪New Raster Layer from
the menu bar.
The New Layer button is in the upper-left corner of the Layer palette, as
shown in Figure 14-1.
If you’re savvy about the various types of layer and know that you want
a specific type, choose Layers from the Paint Shop Pro menu bar. The
menu that appears lets you choose, among others, New Raster Layer, New
Vector Layer, or New Adjustment Layer. For more information about types
of layer, see the nearby sidebar, “Choosing a layer that’s just your type.”
The rather intimidating Layer Properties dialog box appears, trying to
scare you. Forge ahead boldly.
3. Type a name for the layer.
The Name field of the Layer Properties dialog box is already highlighted,
so you don’t have to click there before typing. Whatever you type replaces
the rather boring name (like Layer1) that Paint Shop Pro suggests. Enter a
name in that field that describes what you will put on this layer. If you’re
not feeling creative, just skip this step and Paint Shop Pro uses the boring
name.
4. Click OK.
Get the heck out of this boring, intimidating Layer Properties dialog box
and get on with the fun!
Your image doesn’t look any different, so maybe you’re wondering “Just what
have I accomplished?” Fear not! You have indeed added a layer. The image
doesn’t look any different because your new layer is transparent and blank.
It’s just like a sheet of clear plastic placed over a painting.
Look at the Layer palette. You see your new layer, with the name you gave it,
highlighted. That means that it’s the active layer, and any painting, erasing,
selection, or color adjustment you perform now takes place on that layer.
To delete a layer on the Layer palette, click that layer’s name and then click
the Delete Layer button. Everything on that layer goes away with the layer.

Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 
Choosing a layer that’s just your type
To make life a bit more complicated, Paint Shop
Pro has five different types of layers for different
kinds of stuff. Four of those types of layers
appear in Figure 14-1, where you can see that
they’re distinguished by special icons. Here’s
more about those layers:
Raster: You use this plain-vanilla
type of layer most of the time.
Unless you specify otherwise, you
get one of these when you create a
new layer. A raster layer handles
normal images — the kind made 
of dots, called raster, or bitmap,
images. Raster layers are just like
the background layer, which you’re
already familiar with. Raster layers
are marked with the icon shown
here.
Vector: This special type of layer
comes into play mostly when you
use the Paint Shop Pro text, preset
shapes, or line-drawing tools. Vec-
tor images are made up of lines or
curves connected in a connect-
the-dot fashion. Paint Shop Pro
normally creates text, preset
shapes, and lines as vector
images, although you can alterna-
tively create them as raster
images. Vector images can’t
appear on a raster layer, and raster
images can’t appear on a vector
layer. Vector images are marked
with the icon that appears here.
Adjustment: This special type of
layer doesn’t contain any images!
It’s like a magical coating that
imparts a particular image quality
to the layers under it. It works
almost exactly like color adjust-
ments, so we discuss it some more
in Chapter 10. The advantage of
adjustment layers is that the
enhancement is separated from
the image, so changing your mind
is easier. Adjustment layers are
named according to the kind of
adjustment they perform, and each
of them has its own snazzy color
icon; the one shown next to this
paragraph is Contrast.
Group: Many times, you want to
apply an effect to the same two or
three layers while leaving the
other layers untouched. You can
group the layers so that Paint Shop
Pro treats them like a single layer,
which is awfully handy; we show
you how to do this later in this
chapter.
Mask: Masking is used to hide cer-
tain areas of an overlaying layer’s
image while letting other areas
remain visible. It’s a little like mask-
ing tape except that rather than
cover parts of an image like mask-
ing tape does, masking makes
areas transparent — just as eras-
ing on a layer does in Paint Shop
Pro. That allows the underlying
image to show through. It’s a handy
trick for advanced Paint Shop Pro
users, allowing you to cut out
shapes with little effort or create
transparent areas on the back-
ground layer, although it’s a little
too detailed to go into in a For
Dummies book. Paint Shop Pro 8 is
so brimming with new features that
we had to leave out something.

When you float a selection, it appears on the Layer palette like a layer and is
named Floating Selection (in italics). It’s not really a full-fledged layer, but you
can use Layer menu commands on it, like moving it down in the stack. Refer to
Chapter 12 for the details of floating. You can turn a selection into its own layer,
as we show you later in this chapter.
Working on Layers
To work on a layer, click its name on the Layer palette to select it (make it
active). Then, working on the new layer is very much like working on the
background layer. You can paint, erase, adjust color, cut, copy, paste, and
make image transformations, such as flipping, filtering, or deforming, and
the results appear on only your selected layer. How tidy and organized!
As an artist who is using multiple layers, you’re like a doctor who is seeing
multiple patients. To avoid mistakes, you must know which one you’re oper-
ating on. You can’t tell what image is on which layer by simply looking at the
image. The transparency of layers prevents you. So, instead, keep an eye on
the Layer palette to see which layer is active. The active layer is highlighted
there. Pause your cursor over a layer’s name to see a tiny thumbnail image
of the layer’s contents. If a tool doesn’t seem to be working, you’re probably
trying to work on something that isn’t on the active layer. Try turning various
layers on and off to find the object you want.
Here are a few peculiarities of working with layers:
 Moving: You can use the Move tool (the four-headed arrow) to slide an
entire layer around (but not the background layer). Click the Move tool
on the Tool palette. Then, in the image window, drag the entire layer by
dragging any object on that layer. To move an individual object indepen-
dently of the others on that layer, select the object before you use the
Move tool. (If the object still doesn’t move independently, make sure
that the object’s layer is the active one, reselect the object, and try again.)
 Selecting: When you make a selection on a layer, the selection marquee
penetrates to all layers. That means that you can select an object on one
layer, switch to another layer, and then, for example, fill that selected
area (within the selection marquee) with paint on that other layer.
 Copying: When you copy, you copy only from the active layer — unless
you choose Edit➪Copy Merged. A merged copy includes all the layers.
 Erasing: When you erase or delete on a (nonbackground) layer, you
restore the layer’s transparency. (On the background layer, you leave
behind background color when you erase, or transparency if the image
was originally created with transparent background — and for the
record, photos are not created with transparent backgrounds.)
241
Chapter 14: Layering Images

 Using the Text, Draw, and Preset Shapes tools: The images created
by these tools are, by default, vector-type, not raster-type images. (See
the preceding sidebar, “Choosing a layer that’s just your type,” for more
information about these types.) That distinction means that these ele-
ments normally can’t go on ordinary layers, which hold only raster-type
images. As a result, if you’re not already using a vector layer when you
choose one of these tools, Paint Shop Pro automatically creates a new
vector layer for you. See the section “Using Vector Layers,” later in this
chapter, for more information about what happens in layers when you
use these tools.
Seeing, Hiding, and Rearranging Layers
When you view a multilayer image, you look down through all the layers just
as you would look down through a stack of plastic sheets with stuff painted
on them. To control which layers you see and also adjust the order in which
they’re stacked, use these techniques:
 To see just the active layer: Choose Layers➪View➪Current Only.
 To see all layers: Choose Layers➪View➪All.
 To see specific layers: On the Layer palette, click a layer’s Layer
Visibility toggle, known to its friends as the eyeglasses icon. Each layer
has this icon, to the right of the layer name. Click it once to turn the
layer off (make it invisible) and click again to turn it on. When a layer is
off, an X appears through the eyeglasses icon.
 To move a layer up or down in the stack: Drag it up or down in the left
column of the Layer palette. While you’re dragging, the layer itself doesn’t
move; instead, a black line follows your cursor to tell you where the layer
will go when you release the mouse button. An alternative to dragging is
to click a layer and then choose Layers➪Arrange➪Bring to Top, Move Up,
Move Down, Send to Bottom, Move Into Group, and Move out of Group.
Pinning Layers Together: Grouping
After you have carefully positioned objects on different layers, it’s nice to pin
those layers together so they can’t reposition themselves. If you have painstak-
ingly put Uncle Tobias’s head on the neck of a giraffe, for instance, you want to
keep them together while you get creative with other layers.
The first thing to do is to select the first layer you want to add to your group
and then click the New Layer Group button near the upper-right corner of the
palette. This action brings you to the ever-so-titillating New Layer Group
242
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

dialog box, which looks almost exactly like the New Layer dialog box, and
you should do the same thing you did there: Ignore all those scary options
and just type a friendly name for your group. Then click OK. (As with the New
Layer dialog box, if you leave it to Paint Shop Pro, it chooses something
delightfully undescriptive, like Group1.)
As you can see in the Alex’s Background group shown in Figure 14-1, you now
have a group in your Layers palette, complete with the layer you selected
neatly tucked under it. (You also should see a tiny box with a – next to it; if
you don’t want to see all the layers contained in this group, click the – to hide
them. Click the + sign next to the group to reveal them again.) To add another
layer to your group, click on the name of the layer, drag it back up to just
underneath the name of the layer (it turns into a small black bar), and let go.
Your layer is now a part of the group! (If only high school had been this easy.)
To remove a layer from a group, simply drag it above the group name.
Layers with the same group name behave as though they were pinned
together: When you move one layer with the Move tool (the four-headed
arrow thingy), you move the entire group. Members of a group keep their
independence in other ways, though. If you change the appearance of a layer
(make it brighter, for example), its fellow group members don’t change.
243
Chapter 14: Layering Images
Gone but not forgotten: Layer links
In the old days of Paint Shop Pro, you didn’t
have the handy-dandy Layer Groups command;
instead, you used layer links, which were clum-
sier, harder to remember, and you could have
only 12 of them. In a nod to older Paint Shop Pro
.psp files that may not support layer groups,
Paint Shop Pro 8 also allows you to use layer
links in addition to groups.
Click the layer link toggle to assign a layer link
number to your layer; layers that share the same
layer link number act exactly like groups. Click
the Layer Link toggle button to assign a given
layer to layer link 1, and click it again to raise the
number by one each time, all the way up to the
number of layers you have within your image —
at which point it goes back to having no layer
link. You can tell whether a layer is assigned to
a layer link because it has a small number next
to the tiny chain image.
Honestly, the new Group Layer feature is so
handy that we’re only letting you know about
this ratty ol’ layer link feature in case you open
a Paint Shop Pro 7 (or earlier) file that uses it.
You don’t want to know what happens if you
start mixing layer links and layer groups. (But it’s
much like mixing tequila and rum.)
The upshot is that if you have a layer that you
could swear you have grouped properly but just
doesn’t seem to be affected by something that
changed the rest of the group, check to see that
it doesn’t have a layer link number. If it does,
click the toggle enough times to set the layer
link to None and then group those layers. You’ll
thank us in the morning.

Using Layers to Separate
or Combine Images
The main reasons for using layers are either to break an image apart into sev-
eral layers for more flexible editing or to combine multiple images into one.
This section describes how to do both.
Combining entire images
Do you have two entire images to combine? To combine an entire image file
with the image you’re working on, follow these steps:
1. On the Layer palette of the image you’re working on, click the name
of the layer above which you want to insert your new image.
If the image doesn’t have multiple layers, skip to Step 2.
2. Choose File➪Browse and open the image browser to the folder con-
taining the image file.
Thumbnail pictures of the images in that folder appear. (Refer to
Chapter 1 for more information about how to use the image browser.)
3. Drag the thumbnail picture of the image file to the image you’re work-
ing on.
Paint Shop Pro inserts the new image as a layer, above the layer you
selected in Step 1. (If the image you’re dragging contains multiple layers,
all its layers are grouped together.) The cursor turns into a four-headed
arrow to indicate that Paint Shop Pro has selected the Move tool for you.
4. Drag the new image to position it where you want it.
After dragging, we often click the Arrow tool (at the top of the tool palette) or
some other tool to avoid accidentally dragging the selection when we move
the mouse again.
Separating image parts into layers
How do you get an object separated out and on its own layer? One answer is
that you can select the object and turn it into a new layer, called promoting a
selection. Take these steps:
244
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

1. Select the desired chunk of any existing layer (the background layer,
for example) using any of the Paint Shop Pro selection tools.
We cover selection tools for normal (raster) images in Chapter 12. To
select an object on a vector layer, click the object with the Object
Selector tool (at the bottom of the Tool toolbar).
Is your selection tool not selecting on the object you want? Remember
that selection works within only one layer at a time. Your object may be
on a different layer than the active one. On the Layer palette, click the
layer where that object lives to make that layer active. Then try select-
ing again. If you’re not sure where that object lives, pause your cursor
over each layer’s name, one at a time, and look for your object in the
thumbnail image of the layer’s contents.
2. On the Layer palette, click the layer that you want the new layer to
appear above.
3. Choose Selections➪Promote to Layer from the Paint Shop Pro
menu bar.
A new layer, cleverly named Promoted Selection, appears on the Layer
palette. Although nothing appears to change in your image, your selec-
tion is now on that Promoted Selection layer.
Your object is now on its own layer. A copy of that object remains on the orig-
inal layer. You can now deselect the object; press Ctrl+D or choose Selections➪
Select None.
If you would prefer that no copy be left behind when you promote a selec-
tion, drag the selection slightly after Step 1. On the background layer, this
action leaves behind an area filled with the background color. On other
layers, the area becomes transparent.
Another way to separate image chunks into layers is to select the chunks and
then cut and paste the chunk as a new layer (see the following section).
Copying, cutting, and pasting with layers
A good way to get an image or chunk of an image onto a layer is to copy (or
cut) it and then paste it as a new layer. This approach uses the same, familiar
Windows Clipboard system that other applications use, which is a great way
to combine multiple images, even if the additional images come from a pro-
gram other than Paint Shop Pro. In the following sections, we tell you how to
copy, cut, and paste a selected image as a new layer.
245
Chapter 14: Layering Images

Copying or cutting the image
You can copy or cut images from a variety of sources. Here’s how to do it:
 From a program other than Paint Shop Pro: First, open that program
and display the image you want. (You don’t need to close Paint Shop
Pro.) Exactly how to copy or cut an image from that program varies
somewhat from program to program. Copying from a Web page in
Internet Explorer, for instance, you can right-click the image and then
choose Copy from the menu that appears. In many programs, click the
image to select it and choose Edit➪Copy to put a copy on the hidden
Windows Clipboard.
 From another layer within your Paint Shop Pro image: On the Layer
palette, click the layer containing the object you want. Select the image
chunk you want with any of the Paint Shop Pro selection tools. (Refer to
Chapter 12 for help with selection tools. If the layer is a vector layer, use
the Object Selector tool at the bottom of the Tool palette.) Then choose
Edit➪Copy (or Edit➪Cut, if you want to remove the chunk from its cur-
rent layer).
 From another image file: Open that file in Paint Shop Pro (refer to
Chapter 1). A new window appears, displaying that image. Use any of
the Paint Shop Pro selection tools to select your chosen chunk. Choose
Selections➪Select All if you want to select the whole image. Choose
Edit➪Copy to copy from the active layer. To copy combined images from
all layers, choose Edit➪Copy Merged.
Pasting the image as, or on, a new layer
After you have copied (or cut) an image to the Windows Clipboard, you can
paste it as a layer or on an existing layer. Here’s how to paste it as a layer:
1. Click the title bar of the window in Paint Shop Pro where you want to
paste.
This step makes sure that you paste it in the right place.
2. On the Layer palette, click the layer that you want the new layer to
appear above.
To put a layer above the background layer, for instance, click
Background. If your image has only one layer, you can skip this step
because Background is already selected.
3. Choose Edit➪Paste➪As New Layer or press Ctrl+L.
Your image appears as a new layer, and the Paint Shop Pro cursor
appears as a four-headed arrow. That cursor tells you that Paint Shop
Pro has automatically selected the Move tool for you.
246
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

(If you copy a vector object from outside Paint Shop Pro, such as a
Microsoft Draw object from Microsoft Word, Paint Shop Pro converts it
to a raster layer when you paste it. First, however, Paint Shop Pro dis-
plays a dialog box labeled Meta Picture Import. In that dialog box, set
Width in Pixels and Height in Pixels to the sizes you want for the pasted
image and click OK.)
4. Drag your newly pasted image where you want it.
When you’re done dragging, consider clicking the arrow tool (at the top of
the tool palette) or some other tool to avoid accidentally dragging the selec-
tion with subsequent mouse motions.
Paint Shop Pro assigns a clunky name, such as Layer3, to your new layer on
the Layer palette. To change that name, double-click the layer’s current
name. When the Layer Property box appears, type a new name in the Name
field (already selected, for your convenience) and click OK.
You can also paste an image on an existing layer rather than paste it as its
own new layer. After you have copied or cut the image to the Windows
Clipboard, click the existing layer’s name on the Layer palette and choose
Edit➪Paste As New Selection or press Ctrl+E. The image appears; drag it
where you want it and then click to make it a floating selection. Press Ctrl+D
to deselect the image.
Copying entire layers from
one image to another
When you start using layered images, you may find that a layer you created
in one image is useful in another image. To copy a layer (or layers) from one
image to another, you drag the layer from the Layer palette of the source
image to the destination image. To do so, take these detailed steps:
1. Open both images in Paint Shop Pro.
Each image gets its own window. Arrange the windows so you can see 
at least part of both images. (For instance, choose Window➪Tile
Vertically.)
2. Click the title bar of the destination image.
By destination image, we mean the one where you want the layer to go.
3. On the Layer palette, click the layer above which the new layer is to go.
Clicking makes that layer the active one.
247
Chapter 14: Layering Images

4. Click the title bar of the image containing the layer you want to copy.
5. On the Layer palette, click the name of the layer you want to copy and
drag it to the destination image.
Drag the layer directly into the middle of the destination image, and not
onto the title bar of its window. When you release the mouse button, the
copied layer appears.
Blending images by making 
layers transparent
Double your pleasure, double your fun. One popular effect is a sort of double
exposure, which you do by making an overlaying layer on which the image is
partially transparent. For instance, you may want to overlay a diagram on a
photograph or add a faint image of a logo to a picture.
Figure 14-2 shows a few tasty vegetables overlaid with the word Veggies, per-
haps to be used as a sign for a vegetarian buffet. (It looks much more appeal-
ing in color — see Figure C-4 in the color section of this book.)
Note that Layer 2, which contains the text Veggies, is at 52 percent opacity.
Figure 14-2:
Making
Veggies
transparent
makes them
clearly a
good menu
choice.
248
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

To make a layer transparent, you merely adjust one little setting, Layer
Opacity. Each layer has a Layer Opacity setting on the Layer palette (the
shaded bar shown in Figure 14-2). Until you change it, the setting for every
layer is 100 to indicate that the layer is 100 percent opaque (you can’t see
through the image on the layer).
At the far right end of each bar is a pair of pointers (triangles). Drag that pair
to the left to make the layer more transparent. Drag the pair to the right to
make the layer more opaque. The number on the bar changes as you drag,
between 100 and 0. In Figure 14-2, the layer containing the text Veggies! is set
to 52 percent (roughly half-transparent).
Blending images in creative ways
Sometimes, simply overlaying one image on the other doesn’t give quite the
effect you want. For instance, if you overlay colored text on an image that has
like-colored areas, you can’t read the text in those areas.
In that case, the result may be better if the layer could, for example, lighten
or darken the underlying image — or perhaps change the underlying color,
no matter what color it is. With Paint Shop Pro, you can create those effects,
and more, using layer blending. Layer blending is determined by two settings:
layer blend mode and the layer blend levels.
To use blend modes with forethought and skill requires pondering all kinds of
technical stuff about computer graphics. So, do like we do: Use blend modes
with reckless abandon rather than with forethought and skill. Try one mode,
and if you don’t like the result, try another!
The right side of the Layer palette contains layer blend mode settings you
can change for each layer. Until you change a layer’s blend mode, it’s normal,
which means that the paint on that layer simply overlays the paint on lower
layers, like paint on transparent plastic (see Figure 14-3).
Click the Blend Mode control for your chosen layer and choose a blend mode
from the menu that appears. To restore the original appearance, choose
Normal from the list of modes.
Here are a few tips:
 For maximum contrast between underlying and overlying images, try
Difference mode.
 Try making the color of the overlying layer lighter or darker, if you can’t
get the results you want otherwise.
249
Chapter 14: Layering Images

 Make a layer more transparent if you want to reduce the effect of any
blend mode, producing a more subtle result.
 For a speckly, spray-painted look, try Dissolve mode and also make the
layer partly transparent.
Using a blend mode on a group may or may not work, depending on what
layers are in it; having a group with mixed raster and vector layers will
almost certainly reject the attempt. If you’re trying to blend a group and it’s
not “taking,” try removing layers one by one from the group until it works.
Creating and Using Adjustment Layers
An adjustment layer is sort of like a perfect facial makeup. It doesn’t cover
anything up; rather, it magically changes the appearance of underlying layers.
Changes include brightness or contrast, color, and other effects.
Many of these effects you can create in other ways — with commands on the
Colors menu, for example. In fact, the dialog boxes for adjustment layers are
so much like those for commands on the Colors menu that we cover them
both with one set of instructions in Chapter 10.
So, why use an adjustment layer rather than a command on the Colors menu?
Here are a few good reasons:
 Adjustment layers can affect the entire, combined, multilayer image (if
it’s placed on top of all other layers). Most commands on the Colors
menu, on the other hand, affect only the active layer.
Figure 14-3:
To make
veggies
tastier, try
another way
of blending.
Here, the
blend mode
is Exclusion,
which is
how some
kids prefer
their
veggies.
250
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

 Adjustment layers are useful when you’re using different layers to com-
bine two images. One image may have lower contrast than the other, for
instance. You can put a contrast-adjustment layer above one image and
put the second image above that adjustment layer so that it remains
unaffected.
 An adjustment layer lets you make changes that are later easily reversible.
You can simply delete the layer or change its settings if you later find that
the adjustment is wrong. Otherwise, you need to counter your earlier
adjustment — a trickier job than undoing or changing it.
 You can paint the layer to apply the effect in different strengths in differ-
ent places! This process is admittedly a bit mind-boggling, but if you can
imagine being able to paint brightness (rather than a color), for exam-
ple, you have the idea. Rather than paint, you can copy an image to the
layer, and the brightness of each pixel of the image determines the
strength of the effect.
Adjustment layers change only the appearance of the underlying colors, not
the colors of the layers. For instance, when you use an adjustment layer, the
colors that the Dropper tool picks up and displays on the Materials palette
are the real colors — the color of the paint in the layer, not the apparent
color caused by the adjustment layer.
Creating an adjustment layer
To create an adjustment layer, follow these steps:
1. Open the Layer palette (press the F8 key) if it isn’t already onscreen.
2. On the Layer palette, right-click the name of the layer above which
you want to add the adjustment layer.
3. Choose Layers➪New Adjustment Layers.
4. Choose the type of adjustment layer you want from the menu that
appears.
See the following section for choosing adjustment types. The Layer
Properties dialog box appears.
5. Click the Adjustment tab near the top of that dialog box.
The tab shows various sliders, and other adjustments appear, depending
on your choice of layer type.
6. Make your adjustments and click OK.
We describe how these adjustments work in Chapter 10.
251
Chapter 14: Layering Images

You can delete or move adjustment layers just as you do other layers. See
“Working On Layers,” earlier in this chapter, for instructions. To rename an
adjustment layer, double-click its name on the Layer palette; when the Layer
Properties dialog box appears, click the General tab, enter a new name in the
Name field there, and click OK.
To change these adjustments after you create a layer, double-click the layer’s
name on the Layer palette. You find these adjustments on the Adjustments
tab of the Layer Properties dialog box that appears. It’s the same dialog box
that appears when you create a new adjustment layer (refer to Step 5 in the
preceding list).
Choosing the type of adjustment
layer you need
The Paint Shop Pro adjustment layers give you lots of different ways to fiddle
with the color, contrast, and brightness of the underlying layers of your
image. Here are some suggestions for what to use to achieve various results:
 To adjust brightness or contrast, use the Brightness/Contrast layer.
 The Brightness/Contrast layer affects all three major tonal ranges —
shadows, highlights, and midtones — at one time. To independently
adjust any of these three ranges — to just get darker shadows, for 
example — try a Levels layer.
 If shadows, highlights, and midtones aren’t precise enough for your
brightness and contrast adjustment — you need better contrast only
within specific shadows, for example — you can adjust brightness or
contrast within any range of tone by using a Curves layer.
 For richer/grayer or lighter/darker colors, try a Hue/Saturation layer.
The Hue/Saturation layer also lets you colorize underlying layers (give
them a monochrome tint).
 To make a negative image, choose an Invert layer, set the blend mode to
Normal (if it isn’t already) and set the opacity to 100.
 To reduce the number of colors, resulting in a kind of paint-by-numbers
effect, try a Posterize layer.
 To get a truly black-and-white (two color, no shades of gray) effect,
choose a Levels layer.
252
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

Applying adjustments 
to only certain areas
One cool feature of adjustment layers is that you can apply their effects selec-
tively, to certain areas of your image. Paint Shop Pro uses paint on the adjust-
ment layer to accomplish that result.
After you create the adjustment layer, you can paint out the areas on that
adjustment layer where you don’t want the effect, using black paint. Apply the
paint to the adjustment layer with any painting tool, such as the Paint Brush
tool. The paint doesn’t show as black, but only as a masking out of the effect.
Use gray paint to screen out the effect. (You can also use a texture in the
Material box while you do this to create some neat-looking effects.)
You can also paint in an area with white or gray, if that area is painted out.
Notice that black, white, and shades of gray are the only colors the Materials
Box palette gives you to paint with when you’re working on an adjustment
layer.
Using Vector Layers
Most people discover vector layers accidentally. They use the Text, Draw, or
Preset Shapes tools to create vector objects, and Paint Shop Pro automati-
cally (and without telling them) creates a vector layer to contain the vector
objects these tools produce. (We explain the difference between vector and
raster images and layers in the sidebar “Choosing a layer that’s just your
type,” earlier in this chapter.) See Chapter 15 for more information about
using these tools.
You can also create vector layers intentionally, as we describe in the section
“Creating A New, Blank Layer,” earlier in this chapter. After you create a
vector layer, you can use the Text, Draw, or Preset Shapes tool to add objects
to that layer. You can also copy and paste to move these objects from one
Paint Shop Pro vector layer or image to another. (Refer to Chapter 13 for
more about copying and pasting.)
You can convert a vector layer to a raster layer. The command to choose is
Layers➪Convert to Raster Layer. Converting an image to raster form allows
you to apply any of the raster paint tools to your vector shape to get cool
effects, such as graduated fills or airbrush spraying. The drawback is that
you can then no longer edit the shape by adjusting the lines and points that
make up a vector object. You can’t convert a raster layer to a vector layer.
253
Chapter 14: Layering Images

However, if you copy the vector layer before converting it, you have a backup
copy of it. Simply hide it when it’s not needed.
As you add vector objects to a vector layer, each object gets its own entry on
the Layer palette. The left side of Figure 14-4 shows the Layer palette with two
layers: the background layer and a vector layer, Vector1. To see each individual
object in the vector layer, click the white box with the + sign to the left of the
vector layer’s icon. That action reveals the individual vector objects, indented
under the layer. (To hide the objects, click that same white box again, which
now holds a – symbol.)
Paint Shop Pro has three kinds of vector objects: line objects, text objects,
and groups of objects. Each kind of object has its own icon, as Figure 14-4
shows. Vector1 contains a line object named New Shape, a line object named
Star 2 and a text object named “Hello, you fine readers you.” Star 2 is a single,
multisegment line that is part of the Preset Shapes object library (see
Chapter 15).
Having objects listed on the Layer palette lets you select, delete, hide, or
reposition them in the stack, just as you would a layer — the main difference
is that each object is grouped within a vector layer, just like regular layers are
grouped in layer groups.
Clicking an object on the palette selects it and displays its name in bold type.
(Hold down the Shift key as you click to select multiple objects.) Pressing the
Delete key deletes the selected object. Dragging it moves it up or down in the
stack, enabling you to place it over or under other objects. Double-clicking it
reveals, one of two things: If it’s a text object, it displays the Text Entry dialog
box; if it’s a shape, it displays the Vector Property dialog box. See Chapter 15
for more information about managing vector objects.

Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

Merging Layers
Using multiple layers usually makes working with images easier. Sometimes,
however, you would rather have (or need to have) everything on one layer.
For instance, you may want to use one of the commands on the Colors menu
on the entire image, but the command works on only a single layer. Or, if you
try to save your image as something other than a Paint Shop Pro file, Paint
Shop Pro may offer to merge all the layers for you. (Merging can sometimes
be necessary because not many file types support multiple layers.)
If Paint Shop Pro merges layers when you’re saving a file, it merges layers
only in the file you’re creating on your disk drive. It doesn’t merge the layers
in the image you’re working on in Paint Shop Pro.
Paint Shop Pro gives you two ways to merge layers into one layer. To
merge all the layers (including those whose visibility is switched off),
choose Layers➪Merge➪Merge All. To merge only the visible layers (leaving
the hidden ones as layers), choose Layers➪Merge➪Merge Visible. To merge a
group into one handy layer, choose Layers➪Merge➪Merge Group. Choosing
Layers➪Merge➪Merge Down merges the selected layer with the one under-
neath it.
What happens when you merge? Nothing visible happens to your image when
you merge. The merged layers, however, become one normal (raster) layer,
named Merged, that you see listed on the Layer palette. Any vector layers
(typically text, lines, or preset shapes) are converted into raster images, so
you can’t edit them any more with the text, drawing, or shape tools. When
adjustment layers are merged, they no longer simply affect the image appear-
ance; rather, they modify the underlying colors.

G
iven a paintbrush, most of us would have trouble making nice, neat
text, regular shapes like circles, or even straight lines. We would clamor
for a typewriter, template, ruler, or some other special tool that gives nice
straight edges and shapes.
Clamor not. Paint Shop Pro offers three tools for creating such stuff and one
to help you manage the stuff you create. Figure 15-1 shows those four tools as
they appear at the bottom of the Tools toolbar.
Unless you tell Paint Shop Pro otherwise, these tools create text, lines, and
shapes in a special vector form that makes them easier to change. Images in
this form are known as vector objects. Unlike the other things you can paint or
otherwise create in Paint Shop Pro, vector objects aren’t a collection of pixels
(colored dots). Instead, they’re shapes that have color, line width, and other
properties. These shapes can exist only on special vector layers.

Text tool
Pen tool

Figure 15-1:
Three tools

and one to

So, you ask, “What’s the upshot?” Here’s the bottom line:
 Creating stuff as vector objects: If you use the Paint Shop Pro text, line,
or shape tools in the normal, vector way, your creations are easier to
modify — but you have to know how to deal with layers and the special
features of vector objects. See Chapter 14 for help with layers, and we
explain vector features in this chapter.
 Not creating stuff as vector objects: If you don’t want to bother with
vector layers and special vector object features, you can create text,
lines, and shapes as though they were painted with a brush. This form is
called raster form. If you’re such a dedicated, um, rasterfarian, you must
do this: If you use the Draw or Preset Shapes tool, look at the Tool Options
palette (press F4 if you don’t see it) and then click to clear the check mark
in the Create As Vector check box. If you want text as a raster selection,
choose Selection or Floating from the drop-down Create As menu on the
Tool Options palette. Eh, but we talk about it in the next section. Your
choice of raster remains unless you change it. No problem, mon.
If you need to work on vector objects with raster tools (like the Paint Brush
or Eraser tools), you can convert a vector layer to a raster layer. Choose
Layers➪Convert To Raster Layer. You can’t convert back, however (though
you can use the Undo function if you have done it recently).
Keeping Track of Objects and Layers
Here’s the most important thing to remember about adding text, lines, or
shapes: If you try to add these types of vector objects to a normal, raster
image (such as a digital photograph), Paint Shop Pro automatically, and qui-
etly, creates a vector layer to hold the new object.
258
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 
Antialiasing for smoother edges
Shapes with nice, sharp edges tend to look a bit
ragged when those edges run in any direction
other than perfectly horizontal or vertical. They
develop an objectionable staircase look called
aliasing. Antialiasing is a process of filling in
those steps with a little bit of color, which gives
the illusion of a straighter, if slightly fuzzier,
edge. To antialias objects, place a check mark in
the Antialias check box on the Tool Options
palette.

If you want to return to the rest of the image, you have to switch to the layer on
which the image lives. So, for instance, if you add text to a photograph (which
usually appears on the background layer), you need to press F8 to see the
Layer palette (if it’s not visible already) and then select the background layer.
To add text, lines, or shapes in a nice, controlled fashion, where you know
exactly what layer every object is on, create or select a vector layer before
you create or paste a vector object. See Chapter 14 for help with creating
and choosing layers. As you put vector objects on a vector layer, each object
is listed separately, indented under the vector layer’s name on the Layer
palette. Click the + sign to the left of the layer’s name to display these objects
individually. From within the Layer palette, you can select, reorder, rename,
or delete objects; refer to the discussion of using vector layers in Chapter 14.
Adding and Editing Text
Text in Paint Shop Pro isn’t just your grandfather’s plain old letters and 
numbers. Oh, my gracious, no. Although you can certainly have plain text in
a straight line, you can also have it filled or outlined with colors and patterns,
bend it around curves, or rotate it into a jaunty angle. It’s truly the cat’s 
pajamas!
Creating, placing, and editing text
Text has two parts: an outline, set by the color palette’s foreground controls,
and a fill, set by the background controls. You can have both or either.
If you already have a vector layer (one that has text, lines, or shapes on it),
you may put your text on that same layer; just choose the layer now on the
Layer palette. Or, you may create a new vector layer on which to put your
text. If your active layer is a raster layer (background, for example), Paint
Shop Pro creates a new vector layer for you in the following steps. If you’re
not familiar with layers, don’t worry about all this layer stuff for now.
Here’s how to create basic text:
1. Click the Text tool (as shown in the margin) on the toolbar.
2. If you want outlined text, do the following:
a. Choose a background color (the inside color) by left-clicking the
Background Material box. A small dialog box pops up, giving you a
wealth of colors to choose from. You can either fake it and click OK,
259
Chapter 15: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

which we heartily endorse (remember that just clicking things and hit-
ting OK is an entirely valid way to learn a program), or if you want us to
walk you through it, you can turn to Chapter 3, where we show you how
to choose a specific color.
If you want to have just an outline, leaving the middle of the letters 
completely see-through, click the Transparency button under the
Background Material box. (It’s the rightmost button, and should have
the international circle-with-a-slash No sign in it.) The box turns gray
and contains an international No sign of its own, meaning that the back-
ground color is now set to no color. (If this confuses you, refer to
Chapter 3 to understand these kooky Material boxes.)
b. Choose a foreground color (the outline) by left-clicking the Foreground
Material box. On the Tool Options palette, set the value in the Stroke
Width dialog box to the width of the outline you want, in pixels. For
instance, for an outline 4 pixels wide, set it to 4.
3. If you want solid (filled) text:
a. Click the transparency button under the Foreground Material box. (It’s
the rightmost button, and should have the international circle-with-a-
slash No sign in it.) The box turns gray and contains an international No
sign of its own.
b. Choose a background color by left-clicking the Background Material box
and selecting one from the Material dialog box.
In Paint Shop Pro, a material is a combination of a color, pattern, and tex-
ture. It’s just as easy to use gradients and patterns as the foregrounds
and backgrounds of text as it is to use colors, as we show in Figure 15-2 —
and it makes things look so much snazzier! Again, refer to Chapter 3 to
unveil all the mysteries of the Material boxes.

4. Click your image where you want the center of your text.
The Text Entry dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 15-2. Note that a
preview of your text, as it appears when you click OK, appears on your
image. You can change your choices here by changing what’s in the
Foreground and Background Material boxes.
Figure 15-2 shows how the Tool Options palette controls the width (and
style) of the text outline. It also shows, on the Layer palette, that the text
object appears indented under the vector layer after you click the white
square at the far left end of the object layer (originally containing a + sign).
If you don’t see the Tool Options palette, press F4.
5. Choose a font from the Font drop-down menu on the Tool Options
palette.
6. Choose a font size from the Size selection box or manually enter any
other size you want, in points, on the Tool Options palette.
7. Enter your text in the big box that is ingenuously labeled Enter Text
Here.
The text appears in your chosen font and size. For long, multiline text,
you can press the Enter key to start a new line. If you have multiple lines
of text, decide how you want them aligned (left-justified, centered, or
right-justified) by clicking the appropriate button in the upper-right
corner of the Tool Options palette.
If you know that you’ll be using the same text the next time you use the
Text tool, you can check the Remember Text check box next to the OK
button.
8. To selectively apply any font style (bold, italic, underlined, or
strikethrough), drag across the text you want styled to highlight it.
Then click the B, I, U, or A (strikethrough) buttons on the Tool Options
palette, just as you would in most word processors.
You can also selectively change the font or size of any text by highlight-
ing the text and then choosing a new font or size.
9. For vector text, remember to choose Vector from the Create As menu
on the Tool Options palette.
If you prefer raster text, choose Selection to create a nonfloating selec-
tion (or Floating to create a floating selection). Refer to Chapter 13 to
understand the minor difference between those selection types. If you
don’t care, use Vector.
10. Click the OK button when you’re done.
While you’re using the Text Entry dialog box, it displays a continuously
updated preview of your work in the image window.
261
Chapter 15: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

Your text appears attractively displayed in a rectangular frame that has
squares (handles) around it. This selection frame means that your text object
is selected. You can do several things to the text object now, including move,
resize, rotate, or delete it. See the section “Controlling Your Objects,” later in
this chapter.
You can also edit your text. With the Text tool chosen, double-click directly on
the body (outline or fill) of the text. The cursor turns into a four-headed arrow
when your cursor is properly positioned; clicking and dragging allows you to
reposition it, whereas double-clicking brings up that darned Text Entry dialog
box all over again, where you can change the text or its appearance.
You can turn text into shapes, if you like. For instance, you may want to alter
the shape, rotation, or other attributes of a text character in a creative way.
Select the text you want to convert and then choose Objects➪Convert Text
to Curves. Then, to make each character an individually selectable, movable,
rotatable object, choose As Character Shapes. If you want the characters to
remain part of a single object, choose As Single Shape.
Bending text to follow a line or shape
Is your theatre company performing the Wizard of Oz? Before you can click
your heels together three times and say “There’s no place like home,” you
can make the text on your advertising posters follow the yellow brick road —
or any other (vector) shape or line in Paint Shop Pro. Figure 15-3 shows a
before (top) and after (bottom) picture of fitting text to a line.
Here’s how to do your own:
1. Create your (vector) text.
See the preceding two sections for help with text.
2. Create your shape or line.
See the rest of this chapter for help with lines or shapes. Bear in mind
that if a line is created from left to right, text ends up on top of that line.
If a closed shape is created clockwise, text ends up on the inside. In both
instances, the opposite direction gives opposite results.
3. Click the Object Selector tool.
If you just want to shape the text — you don’t really want the line (or
shape) itself to appear — take one additional step before proceeding
to Step 4. The selection frame is still around your shape or line from its
creation, and you have chosen the Object Selector tool. Now, click the
Properties button on the Tool Options palette. In the Properties dialog
box that now appears, click to clear the Visible check box and click OK.
Your chosen shape becomes invisible, and the selection frame remains.
262
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

4. Hold down the Shift key and click the text so that both line and text
are now within the selection frame.
The top illustration in Figure 15-3 shows this stage of the game.
5. Choose Objects➪Fit Text to Path.
Zap! Wanda the Good Witch puts your text safely on the yellow brick
road to Oz. The bottom part of Figure 15-3 shows the result of fitting text
to the path.
Don’t use solid-color-filled shapes if you intend for your text to be on the
inside of the shape — the fill hides your text! A gradient, textured, or pat-
terned fill, however, usually allows your text to be seen.
Drawing Lines and Shapes
Paint Shop Pro is a quirky little devil. It makes drawing lines and shapes so
darned easy that it’s not even funny, allowing you to draw point-to-point like
a connect-the-dots, to draw freehand like a crayon, or even a combination of
the two. And if you want shapes, hoo-boy! You can select stars, diamonds,
and lucky clovers (not really) from a drop-down menu. Simple!
Figure 15-3:

Chapter 15: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

Now, what about adjusting those lines and shapes when you have drawn
them? That’s a bit trickier and involves adjusting things called nodes — but
we walk you through that process in the next section — never fear. After all,
we’re professionals: professional dummies.
Straight, single lines
To draw a straight (vector) line, click the Pen tool on the Tools toolbar and
then follow these steps:
1. Choose a foreground color, style, and/or texture.
Left-click the Foreground Material box on the Color palette. Refer to
Chapter 3 for more help.
2. Set the mode to Drawing, as shown in Figure 15-4.
Press F4 to bring up the Tool Options palette if you don’t see it.
3. Choose the Line Segments button under Segment Type from the Tool
Options palette.
Press F4 to bring up the Tool Options palette if you don’t see it.
4. Also on the Tool Options palette, set the Width value to the width (in
pixels) of the line you want.
All the Paint Shop Pro value boxes offer a nifty way to adjust them: Click
and hold the big down arrow on the right side of the value box and drag
left or right in the slider that appears.
264
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 
Setting line and fill color for lines and shapes
To determine how lines and outlines look,
choose a foreground color, style, and/or texture
on the Color palette before creating the line or
shape. To determine how fills look (unless
you’re making a single straight-line segment,
where fill doesn’t apply), choose a background
material from the Background Material box
before creating the line or shape. (Remember
that a material is a combination of a color, pat-
tern, or gradient and any textures you choose to
add to it.)
Note that for open shapes (a curvy line, for
example), if you use fill, it fills the area between
the starting and ending point of the shape. In
many such cases, you may want to turn off
background (fill) material altogether: Click the
Transparent button on the right side, just under-
neath the Background Material box.
If you have already created a line or shape and
want to change its appearance, see the
“Changing Colors and Other Properties” sec-
tion, later in this chapter.

You can also choose a line style (like dashes or barbed wire) for your
line at this time by choosing a style from the Line Style drop-down menu,
also on the Tool Options palette.
5. Drag.
Your line not only appears, but it also appears with square dots (han-
dles) on each end. If you want lines drawn at perfect 90-degree or 
45-degree angles (perfect horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines), hold
down the Shift key before you drag, and Paint Shop Pro snaps your 
lines to the nine compass points.
Drag any of the handles around to resize or reorient your line. To move
it, rotate it, or deform it, see “Changing Colors and Other Properties,”
later in this chapter.
Freehand lines or shapes
Freehand lines are basically any old scribble you want to make (or almost
so). Here’s how to scribble in high-technology land. Click the Pen tool on the
Tool toolbar, choose your color (together with any textures, patterns, or gra-
dients) from the material boxes, and then follow these steps:

Chapter 15: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

1. On the Tool Options palette (if the window isn’t onscreen, press F4),
set the mode to Draw.
2. Also on the Tool Options palette, set the Segment type to Freehand.
3. Also on the Tool Options palette, set the Width value to the width (in
pixels) of the line you want.
4. Drag on your image.
5. If you want to turn your line into a shape (with a closed line), click the
Close Selected Open Contours button on the Tool Options palette
when you’re done.
6. If you want to start a new line elsewhere on the canvas, click the New
Contour button on the Tool Options palette.
Paint Shop Pro has this adorable habit of keeping everything you draw with
the Pen tool joined. Even if you draw a squiggle in one corner, start a new
contour, and then draw a loop on the other side of the screen, Paint Shop Pro
thinks of them as one big shape — even if they’re not connected. If you want
to draw two entirely separate shapes so that you can apply separate fills and
strokes to them, right-click the screen and choose New Drawing Object from
the context menu that pops up. You can go back to your old drawing object
by selecting it on the Layer palette.
When you release your mouse button, your line appears with square dots
(handles) around the perimeter. Drag any handle around the outside of the
rectangle to resize or reorient your line.
The line is a clever, automatically constructed, connect-the-dots line. If you
want to drag a line that follows your tight turns more smoothly, you need
dots that are closer together. For a line more obviously made up of line seg-
ments that connect dots, the dots need to be farther apart. On the Tool
Options palette, you can set that closeness by adjusting the Curve Tracking
value: smaller for closer dots and larger for more widely spaced dots.
Connecting dots
A game that many of us loved as children endures in Paint Shop Pro: connect-
the-dots. In this case, however, because you’re a grown-up now, you place the
dots and Paint Shop Pro draws the lines.
The Pen tool’s connect-the-dots system can be as simple as child’s play, but it
can also go way beyond crayons. The Pen tool can give you straight lines
between dots or a snaky line passing through the dots in a smooth fashion you
control. It can also remove dots, break the line into multiple lines, and more.
266
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

To play connect-the-dots with Paint Shop Pro, choose the Pen tool on the
Tools toolbar, choose your foreground (stroke) and background (fill) mater-
ial, and then follow these steps:
1. Select Draw mode on the Tool Options palette.
2. Also on the Tool Options palette, set the Segment type to Point to
Point.
3. Set the Width value, yet still within the Tool Options palette, to the
desired width of your line (in pixels).
4. Set the Background Material box to transparent if you want just a line
or outline, or select a material if you want it filled.
To make it transparent, click the Transparent button on the right side,
just underneath the Background Material box.
5. Make a sequence of clicks on your image, leaving dots (nodes).
As you do, Paint Shop Pro connects the nodes with straight lines. If you
prefer nicely curved lines, see the following section.
As you create this line, if you discover that you have placed an earlier
node in the wrong position, you’re free to return to the node at any time
and drag it to another position.
Technically, you’re in Node Edit mode during this process. See “Picking
at Your Nodes,” later in this chapter, for more information about this
node mode.
6. If you want a shape (with a closed line), click the Close Selected Open
Contours button when you’re done.
Your line now appears in all its colorful, patterned, or textured glory.
Connecting dots with curved lines
To connect your dots with curved lines, don’t just click when you place your
dots — click where you want the dot, but then keep your mouse button down
and drag a little. As you drag, you pull out an arrow by its tip. Your line no
longer bends sharply at the dot. Here’s how that arrow works for you:
 As you drag the arrow longer, the curve gets broader at the dot. If you
make the arrow shorter again, the curve gets sharper at the dot.
 When the arrow appears, you can release the mouse button and make
your adjustments by dragging either end of the arrow.
 If you drag either end of the arrow around the dot, your line rotates to
stay parallel to the arrow where the line and arrow pass through the dot.
267
Chapter 15: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

Figure 15-5 shows the effect of dragging the tip of the arrow. On the left, a
curved line is created and the arrow appears for the latest dot. On the right,
the arrow’s tip is being extended and dragged upward a bit. You can see how
the curve broadens and changes angle to follow the arrow’s direction.
Adding preset shapes
Need a square? Need a star? The Paint Shop Pro Preset Shapes tool lets you
choose from a wide range of predetermined shapes, including circles, rectan-
gles, stars, triangles, and cool icons.
To use a preset shape, click the Preset Shapes tool, as shown in the margin.
The tool lives near the bottom of the Tool toolbar.
Preset shapes are normally vector objects (as are text, lines, and arbitrary
shapes). If you prefer them as raster (normal, bitmap) objects, make sure that
the Vector option box is cleared on the Tool Options palette. If you create any
vector object, it must be on a vector layer. If your active layer isn’t a vector
layer, Paint Shop Pro adds a vector layer for you and places the shape there.
If you like, you can edit the shapes of preset shapes after you have placed
them in your image. Follow the instructions in the section “Picking at Your
Nodes,” later in this chapter.
When you’re done adding preset shapes and you want to work on other parts
of the image, you may need to change to another layer — probably the back-
ground layer. Otherwise, refer to Chapter 14 for the skinny.
Dragging a shape
The Preset Shapes tool can deliver a shape from its library of shapes in any
size, proportion, color, gradient, pattern, or texture you like! Like text and
drawn shapes in Paint Shop Pro, preset shapes have two parts: the outline
and the fill. Follow these steps:

Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

1. Click the Preset Shapes tool on the Tools toolbar.
2. If you want your shape to have an outline, do the following:
Click the Foreground (Stroke) Material box and choose a color from the
dialog box that pops up. For a gradient or patterned outline, switch to
the appropriate tab; refer to Chapter 3 for help on how to set gradients,
patterns, or textures.
On the Tool Options palette, set the value in the Width dialog box to
the width of the outline you want, in pixels. For instance, for an outline 
4 pixels wide, set it to 4.
If you want to use a styled outline (like arrows or dashes) to surround
your shape rather than a solid line, choose a custom line from the drop-
down Line Style menu, also on the Tool Options palette.
If you want no outline, click the Transparent button on the right side
underneath the Background Material box.
3. Select a background for your shape:
Click the Background (Fill) Material box and choose a color from the
dialog box that pops up. For a gradient or patterned outline, switch to
the appropriate tab; refer to Chapter 3 for help on how to set gradients,
patterns, or textures.
If you don’t want your shape filled (that is, you want just the outline of a
shape), click the Transparent button on the right side underneath the
Foreground Material box.
4. On the Tool Options palette, click the down arrow next to the Shapes
preview box and choose a shape in the gallery of preset shapes that
appears.
The Tool Options palette and its gallery of shapes appear.
5. If you want to use the colors, styles, and textures you chose in Steps 1
and 2, make sure that the Retain Style check box is cleared on the
Tool Options palette.
Otherwise, if that box is checked, Paint Shop Pro uses the colors, line
width, and other properties of the original shape that is stored in the
shape library.
6. Drag diagonally on your image.
As you drag, your chosen shape appears and expands. (The colors and
other style attributes don’t appear until you release the mouse button.)
If you drag more horizontally than vertically, the shape is flattened.
Likewise, dragging more vertically gives you a skinny shape. Hold down
the Shift key as you click and drag to create a shape with the original
proportions that’s not skinny or fat.
269
Chapter 15: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

When you release the mouse button, your shape appears fully colored and
filled according to your choices. The shape appears within the usual Paint
Shop Pro object selection frame, which means that you can redimension
the shape by dragging any of the handles (squares) around the edge of
that frame. To rotate your shape, drag the handle at the end of the arm
that sticks out from the center of the frame. A star is born: Figure 15-6
shows the various elements we have discussed in the preceding steps.
Picking at Your Nodes
Paint Shop Pro users have an old saying: “You can pick your friends and you
can pick your nodes, but you can’t pick your friend’s nodes.” It’s not true, of
course, but that doesn’t keep users from saying it. You can freely pick, or pick
at, all your nodes — including your friend’s nodes, if that person gives you a
Paint Shop Pro file with vector lines or shapes in it.
If you want to alter a shape or a line after you have drawn, you need to get
down and dirty and start changing the nodes. Nodes are the dots that Paint
Shop Pro plays connect-the-dots with to create lines and shapes; you can
move nodes, remove them, or change how the line passes through them.
The secret to picking at your nodes in this way is to enter Node Edit mode.

Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

To start fiddling with nodes, you need to select the Pen tool and click the
Node Edit button on the Tool Options palette.
When you have the Pen tool selected, even if you’re not in Node Edit mode,
you still have some node-editing options available (either by dragging or right-
clicking), making a fine distinction between Node Edit mode and the Pen tool in
general a little fuzzy to the casual user — or even to the writers of For Dummies
books, for that matter. You can tell that you can edit nodes if you can see the
nodes (tiny squares) along the line. Also, your cursor turns solid black.
To enter Node Edit mode, follow these steps:
1. Select the Pen tool.
2. From the Tool Options palette, choose Node Edit mode, as shown in
Figure 15-4.
After you’re in Node Edit mode, you can manipulate your nodes all you want.
Here are some changes you can make:
 To select a node for any action (like deleting, dragging, or changing its
type), click it. You know that you can select it when a four-headed arrow
appears under the cursor; you know that a node is selected when it’s
solid black.
 To move a node, drag it. You can move multiple nodes at one time as
long as they’re all selected.
 To delete a node, press Delete.
 To select several nodes, hold down the Shift key while clicking them.
 To select several nodes at one time, make sure that you’re in Node Edit
mode (this action doesn’t work if you’re in Drawing or Knife mode) and
draw a square around the nodes you want to select.
 To select all nodes, right-click a node and choose Edit➪Select All from
the context menu that pops up.
 To join two line segments that are part of the same object (for instance,
if they were created by cutting a line in half with the Pen tool in Knife
mode), select the two ends you want to join by Shift+clicking both of
them and then right-click your image and choose Edit➪Join.
If your vector shape is the only vector layer in your image, you may be able
to select nodes in it, regardless of which layer you’re in — which is a direct
reversal of everything we have told you in all the other layer sections. (Paint
Shop Pro loves to make us look foolish.) However, if you have more than one
vector layer in an image, you can select nodes from only the vector object
you have selected. For more information on what these layers are, look to
Chapter 14.
271
Chapter 15: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

Note that a line has direction, based on the order in which you create the line.
The control arrow that appears on a node in Node Edit mode points in the
line’s direction. The word Start or End that appears when you pause your
mouse cursor over end nodes of a line also tells you the direction. A few
things you do may be dependent on direction, such as aligning text to the
line or shape.
The Pen tool is mightier than the Sword Tool — or would be, if a Sword Tool
existed. Ironically, though, Knife mode is a part of the Pen tool, and it’s might-
ier than the rest of the Pen tool, slicing the lines and shapes you have drawn
in half.
Select Knife mode from the Tool Options palette and drag a line through your
vector object. This separates your object into two separate sets of nodes, cut
cleanly where you drew through them with the knife. Be warned that even if
you separate an image in two with the knife, both still count as one vector
object.
Changing Colors and Other Properties
Don’t like the color or some other look of your vector text, shape, or line? No
problem. Put on colored glasses — or use the Vector Properties dialog box.
Sound like fun? No? Well, it is fun. Follow these steps:
1. Click the Object Selector tool at the bottom of the Tools toolbar.
2. Select the object or objects you want to modify.
The selection frame appears around your chosen object or group of
objects. See the following section for different ways to select objects.
3. Right-click the object and then choose Properties from the context
menu that drops down.
The Vector Properties dialog box, as shown in Figure 15-7, makes the scene.
With this puppy onscreen, you can change all kinds of features.
Here’s a list of what you can change:
 Object name: If you have lots of different objects in your image, you may
find naming them useful. Enter a name in the Name text box, if you like.
 (In)visibility: Clear the Visible check box to make your object invisible.
What good is an invisible object? It’s useful mainly as a hidden curve for
text to follow. See “Bending text to follow a line or shape,” earlier in this
chapter, to find out how to make text follow a curve.
272
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

 Aliasing (staircasing): Place a check mark in the Antialias check box
to avoid the jaggies (jagged edges) that afflict the edges of computer-
generated shapes.
 Color/gradient/pattern/texture: The Styles and Textures swatches work
just like the ones in the Material boxes, except that you can’t make them
transparent from here.
 Thickness of line or outline: For a thicker line, adjust the Stroke Width
value upward.
 Dashed line or outline: Click the Line Style drop-down list and choose
something appropriately cool.
The rest of the controls have to do with joins. The term join refers to the
point that forms where line segments meet. Paint Shop Pro offers three basic
types of join, which you select by clicking the arrow next to the Join drop-
down list box and then choosing one of these options:
 Miter: A miter join (what Paint Shop Pro normally creates) is one that
ends in a point. It tries to end in a point, anyway. If the lines meet at an
acute angle, Paint Shop Pro gives up in disgust and creates a flat
(beveled) end. The point at which it gives up is controlled by the value
in the Miter Limit value box. Fiddle with it this way:
• If you want a point, increase the Miter Limit value.
• If you want a flat end, decrease the Miter Limit value.
 Round: A round join is one that is, well, round at the point. Enough said.
 Bevel: A bevel join is one that is flat at the point, like a miter join that
has reached its miter limit (or a computer user who has reached her
limit and has been banging her head against the wall).

273
Chapter 15: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

These join settings are available when you first create a line or shape, on the
Tool Options palette.
Controlling Your Objects
Creating objects is one thing; getting them to do what you want is another —
sort of like having kids. If the time has come to discipline your vector objects,
Paint Shop Pro can make them straighten up and fly right.
Lots of illustrations need objects that are precisely centered, balanced, or
distributed evenly. You can certainly arrange objects by dragging them and
rotating them. For drill-team precision, however, you should also check out
the Paint Shop Pro vector object positioning talents.
Selecting and grouping vector objects
To do anything to an existing object, you need to select it first. Vector objects
(the usual Paint Shop Pro form of text, lines, and shapes) have their own
selection tool — the Object Selector tool. The Other Paint Shop Pro selection
tools (the Magic Wand, Freehand, and Selection tools) don’t work on vector
objects.
Click the Object Selector tool that appears on the Tools toolbar and then do
one of the following:
 Click your vector object to select it: If the object has gaps in it (spaces
between letters, for instance), don’t click the gaps. Even if the object
isn’t on your active layer, the tool selects the object. Your layer selection
doesn’t change.
 Drag around one or more objects. Whatever vector objects you drag
around become selected. Selecting multiple objects lets you treat them
as a group for many purposes: You can change their color, change other
properties, or use the Paint Shop Pro automatic arrangement features.
 Hold down the Shift key and click multiple objects to select a group.
To remove objects from that selection, hold down the Ctrl key and click
them.
You don’t need to use the Object Selector tool. With the Layer palette open,
you can click the object’s name on the list of layers. Refer to the discussion of
using vector layers in Chapter 14.
274
Part IV: Changing and Adding Content 

A selection frame appears around your object or group of objects, with
squares (handles) you can drag to move, resize, or rotate the object or group.
To create a single object out of multiple objects, select them all and choose
Objects➪Group. To ungroup them again, select the group and choose
Objects➪UnGroup.
To deselect, press Ctrl+D or choose Selections➪Select None from the menu
bar. To select all objects, press Ctrl+A or choose Selections➪Select All.
Paint Shop Pro selects an object automatically after you create it so that you
can move, resize, or rotate the object. You can tell that the object is selected
by the rectangular frame that appears around it. Even though the object is
selected, however, you can’t access the same context menu (the thing that
pops up when you right-click) that you could access if you had selected the
object with the Object Selector tool! For instance, you can’t change the
object’s color unless you first select the object with the Object Selector tool.
Deleting, copying, pasting, and editing
As with nearly any Windows program, you can delete, cut, copy, or paste
selected objects in Paint Shop Pro using the Windows Clipboard. First, select
the object with the Object Selector tool. Next, do any of the following:
 Copy, cut, or delete: Use the conventional Windows keystrokes (Ctrl+X
to cut, Ctrl+C to copy, and the Delete key to delete) or the familiar tool-
bar buttons Cut (scissors icon) or Copy (two documents icon).
 Paste: You can use the conventional Paste command (Ctrl+V) and Paste
button (Clipboard-with-document icon). These conventional methods,
however, create an entire, new image from the Clipboard contents. More
likely, you want to paste the object as a new object on the current layer.
For that, choose Edit➪Paste➪As New Vector Selection or press Ctrl+G on
your keyboard. Your copied object appears and is selected so that you
can position it; click to anchor it. Another alternative is to paste your
object as a new layer: Choose Edit➪Paste➪As New Layer or press Ctrl+L.
Positioning, arranging, and sizing by hand
To move an object (or group of objects), select it with the Object Selector
tool. You can then position it in the following ways:
275
Chapter 15: Adding Layers of Text or Shapes

 Move it: Click anywhere on an object (on the outline or fill, but not in
gaps like the spaces between letters), and then you can drag it anywhere.
Or, you can drag the object by the square handle in the center of the
selection frame. You can tell when your cursor is properly positioned
over the square handle because the cursor displays a four-headed arrow.
 Resize or reproportion it: Drag any corner of the frame, or any side of
the frame, by one of the square handles to resize the object or group. By
default, Paint Shop Pro keeps the proportions constant; if you want to
drag one corner away to skew your shape, hold down the Shift key as you
drag, and if you want to change the perspective, hold down Ctrl. These
work pretty much like the Deformation tool, described in Chapter 13.
 Place it on top of or underneath another object: Vector objects can
overlay one another, so sometimes you need to control which object is
on top of which. Envision them in a stack and the following menu
choices on the Objects➪Arrange menu make sense:
• Bring To Top (puts your selected object on top of all)
• Move Up (raises your object in the stack)
• Move Down (lowers your object in the stack)
• Send to Bottom (puts your object on the bottom of the stack)
Alternatively, you can see the stack of objects on the Layer palette and
adjust an object’s positioning by dragging it up or down. Refer to
Chapter 14, where we discuss using vector layers.
 Rotate it: Sticking out from the center square is an arm that ends in a
square handle. Pause your mouse cursor over that handle so that the
mouse cursor displays a pair of circling arrows. Drag the handle around
the center square to rotate your object.
 Delete it: Press the Delete key on your keyboard.

n the end, you probably want your image to appear
somewhere else besides Paint Shop Pro: on a piece of
paper, on the Web, or as part of an animation. Check out
this part for help in taking your image that last mile.
For printing on paper, we show you in Chapter 16 how to
get the size and proportions right. We also tell you how to
print multi-image pages for photo albums, collages, and
portfolios.
Web work often involves getting the right kind of ﬁle and
making some trade-offs. In Chapter 17, we tell you how to
choose and create the best image ﬁle type, including spe-
cial Web effects, such as transparency and different kinds
of fade-in as an image downloads. We also show you how
professional Web designers create Web pages and how
Paint Shop Pro can create an HTML page for you.
When you have successfully learned all that Paint Shop
Pro 8 has to offer, Chapter 18 shows you two handy new
tricks that can save you tons of time: scripts, which
record your actions and play them back at super-speed,
and presets, which save your tool settings and reload
them with a click.

A
ll this electronic image stuff is just fine, but in the end many of us want
our images printed on dead and flattened, bleached trees — paper. As a
good friend once said, “The paperless office of the future is just down the hall
from the paperless bathroom of the future.” Paper will be around for a little
while yet.
Paint Shop Pro has some great features for making the printing job easier:
automatically fitting the image to the page, printing a collection or album
page of images, printing browser thumbnails, and more. Read on for ways to
make paper printing work better and faster for you.
Fitting Your Print to the Paper
“Let the punishment fit the crime,” said Gilbert and Sullivan’s Mikado, who
prescribed the death penalty for flirting. With the help of the few hints in this
section, your image should fit your page with far less pain.
If you have multiple images open in Paint Shop Pro, click the title bar on the
window of the image you want to print. That makes it the active window.

You can find all the controls for sizing and positioning your print on paper
by choosing File➪Print to bring up the Print dialog box and then clicking
the Placement tab if it’s not already shown. You can see the handy-dandy
Placement subscreen, as shown in Figure 16-1, and then consult the following
bulleted list for help.
Keep in mind that when Paint Shop Pro changes the size of your print, it’s not
changing your image. It’s only resizing the printed output; the image itself
isn’t changed in any way. If your image is 500 pixels across, it remains 500
pixels across.
Use these options in the Placement dialog box to fit your print to your paper:
 Number of Copies: This option is self-explanatory. You can print as
many as a hundred copies at a time, but we wouldn’t advise it unless
you have lots of ink hanging around.
 Printing sideways (orientation): Paint Shop Pro initially sets you up to
print in portrait orientation on the paper, in which the paper’s long
dimension runs vertically. For prints that are wider than they are high,
however, you may want to print sideways, or in landscape orientation.
Click either Portrait or Landscape to choose orientation.
 Centering: Often, you want your print centered on the page. Click the
Center on Page radio button to do just that.
 Filling the page: To fill the page with your image (to the maximum
extent possible), click the Fit To Page radio button, and your print is
enlarged until it fills either the width or height of the paper, within the
allowable margins of your printer.

280
Part V: Taking It to the Street 

 Upper Left of Page: What else can we say? It’s in the upper-left corner.
 Offset: If having your image in the middle or the upper-left corner isn’t
good enough for you, selecting the Custom Offset value allows you to
position your image on the paper wherever you want it. The Left and Top
Offset values — which are grayed out unless you specifically choose
Custom Offset — control how far your image is placed from the left or top
margin. Enter however many inches you want your image to be shoved
away from either side, and the result shows in the preview window.
 Making the image larger or smaller: You can print your image as small
as .025 percent of its original size or scale it up to a Godzilla-size 1000
percent (ten times larger). Adjust the Scale value in the Size and position
area to whatever percentage you want. A setting of 100 percent means
that the image’s resolution, assigned at its creation, is observed. An
image 144 pixels wide, for instance, at a typical resolution of 72 pixels
per inch, is printed 2 inches wide. (This option is grayed out in the Fit to
Page feature, which scales your image automatically.)
Another method of scaling your printed image is to specify a specific
size, in inches, at which the image is printed. Enter a value for either the
width or the height; the image scales proportionately, so if you double
the width, the height is also doubled. 
When you print an image at a scale much greater than 100 percent, your
pixels may begin to show. Scandalous! Rather than scale your print, try
closing the Print dialog box (click Close) and scaling your image by that
same percentage, resampling it via Smart Size. Refer to Chapter 11 for
help with resizing. Your image may be a bit blurred, but it doesn’t look
as pixelated.
Printing in Grayscale and Other Options
If you’re looking to save some color ink, you can choose File➪Print to bring
up the Print dialog box and then click the Options tab. It gives you a choice of
three colors in which to print: Color, Greyscale (black and white), and CMYK
separations. (Don’t worry about printing CMYK separations unless you’re a
professional artist — if you are, you know what to do when you see it.)
If you’re going to print lots of images, you may want the filename of the image
on the print. If so, enable the Image Name check box. (If you have entered a
title on the Creator Information tab in the Current Image Information dialog
box, that title appears in place of the filename.)
281
Chapter 16: Printing

In some instances, you may want to trim the margins off the print when
you’re done. If your image has a white background, however, finding those
margins may be hard. To solve that problem, enable the Print Corner Crop
Marks and Print Center Crop Marks check boxes.
Printing an Image
After you have set everything to your liking, it’s time to get printin’!
1. If you haven’t already, choose File➪Print, press Ctrl+P, or click the
Print button on the toolbar.
The Print dialog box appears.
2. If necessary, choose your printing options.
By clicking the Properties button, you can adjust the usual controls that
come with any Windows program: the printer you’re using, the number
of copies you want, and a Properties button that takes you to the
printer’s driver software. (That’s where you can set the print quality,
speed, paper type, and other variables. Refer to the section “Printing at
Different Speeds or Qualities,” later in this chapter.)
3. Click Print after you have set all the options you want.
Shortly, you have hard copy of your hard work.
Printing Collections or Album Pages
One of the most popular Paint Shop Pro features is the ability to print multi-
ple images. It’s a great way to create album pages or make collages of photos
to celebrate an event.
First, select in the image browser the images you want to print (hold down
the Ctrl key and click them — or refer to Chapter 1 for another way), and
then choose File➪Print Layout. Your entire Paint Shop Pro window changes
to the multi-image printing tool shown in Figure 16-2.
The multi-image printing tool occupies the entire Paint Shop Pro window. To
exit from it and return to the normal window, choose File➪Close Print Layout.
Unless you have saved your layout (see the section “Saving and reusing your
template,” later in this chapter), closing the tool discards your layout.
282
Part V: Taking It to the Street 

With the multi-image printing tool onscreen, here’s the basic procedure:
1. Choose the page orientation.
Paint Shop Pro initially gives you a portrait-oriented page (long dimen-
sion vertically). If you want a landscape- (sideways-) oriented page,
choose File➪Print Setup and then click Landscape in the Print Setup
dialog box that appears. Click OK.
2. If you want to use a template for your images, choose File➪Open
Template.
A template is a prefab layout you can use to arrange your photos to save
time. As a bonus, templates look nicer than dragging pictures helter-
skelter onto the page (well, better than the way we drag them, anyway).
Paint Shop Pro gives you a dialog box with three categories of templates
you can choose from: Avery, Combinations, and Standard Sizes. Click a
category to bring up a gallery of templates:
• Avery templates: Intended for the industry-standard Avery labels —
sheets of precut stickers you can use in your printer. Yes, you can
print stickers with your baby on it! Each Avery template has a
number underneath it, like Avery 8386; this number refers to the
Figure 16-2:
Composing
a multi-
image page.
283
Chapter 16: Printing

product number of a specific Avery label sheet, which you can buy
at your local office supply store. Use the right sheet with the right
template, and you have perfect stickers.
• Standard sizes: Templates in which all the images are one size:
5x7, wallet-size photos, miniwallets, and the like.
• Combination sizes: Templates with mixtures of sizes, generally
one or two larger photos at the top and a bunch of smaller ones at
the bottom.
Each template has a small thumbnail that shows you what its layout is
like; click a template and click OK to apply it, or click Cancel to escape.
3. Drag images, one at a time, from the left column onto the page.
If you have a template applied, drag the photo into each of the boxes;
Paint Shop Pro automatically resizes the photo so that it fits as best it
can into the box.
If you don’t have a template applied, you have to resize the photos man-
ually. If the images are too large for the page, Paint Shop Pro asks if you
want to scale it. If you click Yes, your image appears with handles
(square dots) at the corners that you can drag to resize the image.
Choose No if you want to use the Paint Shop Pro autoarrange feature
(see Step 4) to place and size the image for you.
If an image is rotated 90 degrees the wrong way, drag it to the page and
click the 90+ (clockwise) or 90– (counterclockwise) button on the tool-
bar to rotate the image.
4. If you haven’t applied a template and want to position the images
yourself, drag them into position.
If you don’t want to use a template but still want everything lined up
neatly, you can choose Preferences➪Auto Arrange, which lines up your
images for you sans template.
5. To print your page, click the Print icon on the toolbar or choose
File➪Print.
Neither choice gives you a Print dialog box, but immediately sends the
page to your printer. If you need to change any printer settings, do so
before sending the page to the printer. Choose File➪Print Setup and
click the Printer button in the Print Setup dialog box that appears.
If you’re done, return to the normal Paint Shop Pro window by choosing
File➪Close Print or click the Close button on the toolbar (the door-with-
arrow icon).
284
Part V: Taking It to the Street 

If you’re using a pregenerated template and Paint Shop Pro asks “The current
template has changed, would you like to change it?” when you exit, do not
accept the default name if you choose to save it. (Avery templates in particular
do not like being fiddled with — and by just clicking OK, you’re overwriting
the template, potentially changing vital placement information.)
Fooling with the pictures and layout
You can fiddle with the pictures and their arrangement all you want, after
they’re on the page. Most controls for fiddling are duplicated on the menu
bar, the toolbar across the top of the window, or, if you right-click an image,
on the context menu that appears. Nearly everything can be done fastest by
the right-clicking approach, so that’s mainly what’s in the following list. Here
are some basic fiddlings you may want to do:
 To select a picture so that you can do something with it, click it.
(Handles appear at its corners.)
 To move a picture, drag it.
 To position a picture in the center or at any of the four corners of the
page, click any of the five positioning buttons at the far right end of the
toolbar. The icon indicates the position the button delivers. Pause your
cursor over the button for a text indication of its positioning.
 To resize a picture, drag any of its handles.
 To remove a picture from the layout, either click it and press the Delete
button on your keyboard or right-click it and choose Remove from the
context menu.
 To rotate a picture, right-click it and choose Rotate 90+ or Rotate 90– from
the context menu that appears (+ is clockwise).
 To see an alignment grid, right-click the white page background and
choose Show Grid from the context menu. (Repeat to turn the grid off;
this action doesn’t work if you have a template loaded.)
 To make photos snap to the grid when you move them, right-click the
white page background and choose Snap To Grid from the context menu.
(The grid must be on first, or else this command is grayed out.)
Saving and reusing your template
To save this attractive arrangement of photos, choose File➪Save Template.
In the Save As dialog box that appears, enter a name for your layout in the 
285
Chapter 16: Printing

filename text box. Unless you tell Paint Shop Pro otherwise, it saves the layout
as a set of empty boxes, forgetting what photos were there; you can tell it to
remember the photos by checking the Save with Images check box.
To reuse this layout, reopen the Print Layout screen and then choose File➪
Open Template. Select your template in the Open dialog box that appears.
When you open a template, it brings up the image in its current condition,
whatever that may be. For that reason, be sure not to move any images to
other folders or rename them because then the multi-image print tool can’t
find them.
Printing at Different Speeds or Qualities
Paint Shop Pro itself doesn’t have much to do with choosing the quality
or speed of printing your printer delivers. That falls in the province of the
software that runs your printer, known as its driver. To access that piece of
software, click the Properties button in the Print dialog box. Because what
happens next depends on your printer, we can’t tell you exactly what you
see from then on.
Speed, size, and ink
Quality comes at the cost of speed and of ink. Most printers have draft and
quality settings. If you want just a general idea of how your image will look
and want to save time and ink, choose Draft. Your image is printed lighter and
fuzzier than if you choose the quality (or nondraft) setting, but is printed
more quickly.
The size of your printed image also costs you time and ink. Doubling the size
increases the amount of ink you need by four.
Many inkjet printers do a much better job on special photograph-quality
paper. In that case, the printer driver generally has a setting where you can
tell it that you’re going to use special paper.
Printer and image resolution
One aspect of print quality is resolution, or dots per inch. A higher resolution
generally gives a better-quality image. That resolution number is often con-
fusing because your image has resolution too, in pixels per inch. The two
286
Part V: Taking It to the Street 

don’t match, either. The printer resolution is always a higher number than
image resolution.
What’s going on? Your printer creates its range of colors by putting out tiny
dots in four colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. It needs many tiny dots
to make a pixel of a particular color, so your printer needs many more dots
per inch (dpi) than your image has pixels per inch. Dave’s printer, for
instance, can print 1440 dpi. So, each pixel of a 72-pixel-per-inch image covers
an area of 20 x 20 dots of ink. For an image twice that resolution, Dave gets an
area of only 10 x 10 dots, giving him one-fourth the number of possible colors.
The bottom line? Although using a higher image resolution when you create
your image gives you more detail in your prints, don’t push it too high and
don’t try to match your printer’s resolution. If you use a higher image resolu-
tion (pixels per inch), each pixel uses fewer printer dots, so color accuracy
may suffer. Your printer driver does a few tricks to keep things accurate, but
the laws of physics eventually win.

 Creating GIF and JPEG images
 Creating hot spots and rollovers
T
he Web makes special demands on graphics. Images have to be stored as
particular file types, and they can’t take too long to download or else
people get bored.
What’s more, popular tricks and techniques have been developed for Web
graphics. On some pages, you can click different spots of an image to go to
different Web pages. Other pages provide rollover graphics that respond to
the viewer’s mouse position and actions. These techniques aren’t part of the
images themselves, but are part of the Web page. The Paint Shop Pro
Webtools feature lets you create these Web page features.
In this chapter, we show you how to make your Web images look their best
while downloading as fast as possible. We also show you how to use the Paint
Shop Pro automated Webtools to quickly generate Web pages and rollovers.
Paint Shop Pro offers a special Web toolbar for the Web features we discuss
here. With the Web toolbar enabled, you simply click a button for an effect
rather than use the menu commands. To enable the toolbar, choose View➪
Toolbars➪Web.
Making Images Download Faster
The key trick with images on the Internet is to make sure that they don’t take
any longer to download than they have to. Web users are fickle: If you make
them wait, they don’t stay around. Images download faster when their files
are smaller, which is especially handy when you’re sending pictures via

e-mail. The following list describes a few general tips for making sure that
your images download as fast as possible — some you do when you’re creat-
ing the Web page and others you do in Paint Shop Pro:
 Reduce image size: The main mistake made by beginners is to use
excessively large images on their Web pages. Web page authoring tools
sometimes give the illusion of having made an image smaller, but in fact
they just squeeze a large image into a small space. Size or resize your
image in Paint Shop Pro to exactly the size you need on the Web page;
refer to Chapter 11 for details.
 Repeat images: In your Web page authoring software, if your page uses
the same image over and over again (for a bullet icon, for example),
insert exactly the same image file each time. Don’t use multiple files that
are identical copies of the same image.
 Reduce colors: If you’re painting or drawing an image in Paint Shop Pro
for Web use, don’t use any more colors than you have to.
 Use solid colors: Gradient fills, dithered or airbrushed areas (hues made
up of multicolored pixels), and scanned printed images (made up of visi-
ble dots) require larger files. Paint with solid colors wherever possible if
you want to keep file size down. Noise effects, such as Edge Preserving
Smooth on the Paint Shop Pro Effects menu, can help reduce dots to uni-
form colors.
Exporting Images for the Web
The images that appear on Web pages are almost always stored as one of two
main types of file: GIF or JPEG. Sometimes, they’re stored as PNG files, a new
and improved type of file, but that type is still rarely used. To make your
image viewable on a Web browser, all you have to do is make sure to save a
copy of the image as one of these file types.
To create a Web file from your image, you can go either of two ways:
 Save the image as a particular type of file (choose File➪Save As or File➪
Save Copy As, as we describe in Chapter 1).
 Export the image to a particular type of file.
Exporting takes you immediately into an optimizer dialog box for that type of
file, where you choose features and tradeoffs.
Always store your image as a Paint Shop Pro file before you create Web image
files from it. Paint Shop Pro files retain lots of features that are lost when you
store an image as a Web image.

Choosing features and file types
Each file type has its own advantages and features. Table 17-1 lists attributes
you may want, and the file type or types that are generally best to use. Best
considers both image quality and speed of downloading (file size).

Chapter 17: Creating Web Images

Creating GIF files
GIF files are the most widely used graphics files on the Web. They offer cer-
tain popular features, such as transparency, but are also limited to 256
colors. To export a GIF file from your image, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export➪GIF Optimizer.
The GIF Optimizer dialog box (the optimizer) appears, containing five
tabs of settings that we cover throughout the next few sections. The
optimizer has before and after preview windows (left and right, respec-
tively) that show what effect your choices have. To zoom in or out, click
the Navigation icons. Click the magnifier with the + to zoom in, or the
one with the – to zoom out.
2. Click the OK button.
The familiar Save As dialog box appears.
3. Choose a filename and folder for the file and click OK.
You can (and should) make image files smaller so that they download faster;
see the section “Reducing download time,” a little later in this chapter.
Creating transparent areas
To prepare an image to have transparent portions on the Web, first save your
image as a Paint Shop Pro file. Then choose any one of the following alterna-
tive approaches to mark a transparent area — whichever approach seems
easiest to you:
 Color: If all the pixels in the area you want to become transparent are
roughly the same color (a white background, for example), you don’t
need to do much more in preparation. Just make sure that your chosen
color does not appear in any pixels where you don’t want transparency,
such as the whites of people’s eyes. If the color does appear elsewhere,
try one of the two following approaches instead.
 Selection: Select either the object that you want to be visible (opaque)
or the background that you want to be transparent.
 Transparency: If the object (your logo, for example) that you want to be
visible (opaque) isn’t already on its own layer or layers, select it and pro-
mote it to a layer. On the Layer palette, turn off the visibility of the back-
ground layer and any other unwanted layers, and the transparent portions
of the logo layer are apparent (display a checkerboard pattern).
To have edges of a selected area blend gradually into the Web page’s back-
ground, contract the selection by a certain number of pixels (4, for example).
Then feather the selection by that same number of pixels. (Refer to Chapter 12
for help with contracting and feathering a selection.)
292
Part V: Taking It to the Street 

A tab in the GIF Optimizer dialog box lets you translate your chosen area 
into a transparency. In the GIF Optimizer dialog box, click the first tab,
Transparency. This tab asks “What areas of the image would you like to be
transparent?” Your choices are shown in this list:
 None: Choose this option if you want no transparent areas whatsoever.
 Existing image or layer transparency: Choose this option if your image
already has transparent areas (appearing as a gray checkerboard pat-
tern) that you want to remain transparent on the Web page. This is the
Transparency approach in the preceding bulleted list.
 Inside the current selection: Use this option if, using the Paint Shop Pro
selection tools, you have selected the area (the background, for example)
that you want to become transparent (the Selection approach in the pre-
ceding bulleted list). If you have selected instead the area that is to remain
opaque, choose Outside the Current Selection.
293
Chapter 17: Creating Web Images
Opening and using transparent GIF files
If you open a transparent GIF file in Paint Shop
Pro, you may be surprised at what you see:
Areas that appear transparent in a Web
browser are filled in with a color. That result
occurs because GIF transparency is a special
trick used mainly in Web browsers. Paint Shop
Pro shows the reality behind the trick.
GIF files achieve transparency by designating
as transparent a particular color on the palette.
Web browsers pay attention to that designation
and show the underlying Web page background
where that color occurs. Paint Shop Pro, how-
ever, shows the color itself — unless you tell it
otherwise.
To tell Paint Shop Pro to show the transpar-
ency, choose Image➪Palette➪View Palette
Transparency. Repeat the command to return to
viewing the color.
If you want another color on the file’s palette to
be displayed as transparent, choose Image➪
Palette➪Set Palette Transparency. In the Set
Palette Transparency dialog box that appears,
click the option Set the Transparency Value to
Palette Entry __, and then click your chosen
color in the image window. To turn off trans-
parency, choose the No Transparency option.
Click OK when you’re done.
Be careful when choosing a color. It may be
used in places where you’re not expecting it —
white, for instance, may appear in someone’s
eyes, giving a spooky result when the whites of
their eyes become transparent! Likewise, you
may find that the area you want transparent is
composed of more than one color, leaving an
unseemly halo of not-quite-your-selected color
around everything else in the image. To fix it,
you have to select the area and tell Paint Shop
Pro to make it transparent; refer to Chapter 12
for an example of this halo problem and how to
select it properly.
Remember that GIF files are palette-type files,
so many Paint Shop Pro features don’t work
unless you convert the file to 16.7 million colors
first. (Press Ctrl+Shift+0.)

 Areas that match this color: Choose this option (the Color approach in
the preceding bulleted list) if the areas you want transparent are all the
same color. If the color that is already displayed in the adjoining color
swatch is not the one you want to make transparent, move your cursor
outside the dialog box, over the image, and click any area of your
chosen color. The result appears in the right preview window. Increase
the Tolerance value to make a wider range of similar colors transparent
or decrease it to narrow the range of colors made transparent.
Choosing image fade-in
As GIF images download, they build gradually onscreen. You can choose
whether they build from top to bottom or fade in from fuzzy to increasingly
detailed. For small images that download quickly, the choice doesn’t matter
much. To choose a method, click the Format tab.
On the Format tab, choose Non-Interlaced if you want the image to build from
top to bottom. Choose Interlaced if you want the image to fade in. Leave the
option labeled What version do you want the file to be? set to Version 89a
unless someone specifically requests a file of Version 87a.
Reducing download time
For GIF files, you can reduce download time in two ways: Reduce the physical
size of the image, and reduce the number of colors in it. (We tell you how to
resize in Chapter 11.) Removing unused colors saves time, which makes
sense — why send 256 colors across the Internet when you can send only 40?
To reduce colors, select the Colors tab of the GIF Optimizer. You have several
options:
 How many colors do you want? The lower the number of colors, the
quicker the file downloads. Take out too many colors, and the image
may start to look grainy or choppy. Experiment with this value, setting it
as low as you can until you find something acceptable in the preview
window.
 How much dithering do you want? It sounds like if you set this option
high, Paint Shop Pro would just waste your time, saying “Oh, I don’t
know — what do you want?” In reality, though, if you have removed a
bunch of colors, this setting controls how much Paint Shop Pro attempts
to simulate those removed colors by filling them in with the colors it
does have. That helps to make a low-color image look smoother, but at
high values it may add weird moiré patterns or make it look spotty.
Again, experiment to find the right value for you.
 What method of color selection do you want to use? There are only
two you need to be concerned with:
294
Part V: Taking It to the Street 

• Existing Palette: Uses the colors in the original image, although they
may not look right on other computers.
• Standard/Web-safe: Ensures that the image looks the same on all
computers, although it may not look quite like what you originally
created.
When you’re done selecting all these options, you can select the Download
Times tab to see a chart of how quickly your image loads at various speeds.
People with modems are generally running at 56 Kbps; unless you know for a
fact that the people who will be viewing these images have something other
than a modem, assume that they use a modem.
The GIF Wizard
Alternatively, you can choose to click the Use Wizard button at the bottom of
the GIF Optimizer dialog box. The GIF wizard asks you five questions dealing
with palettes, backgrounds, and quality, all of which we detail earlier.
Creating JPEG files
JPEG files tend to be smaller than GIF files for many kinds of images, so they
download faster. The main tradeoff is that JPEG files are lossy. They lose some
detail in your original image, and the clean lines of text can look fuzzy. You can
choose how much detail to trade off for a reduction in file size, however.
The second tradeoff is that JPEG files can introduce artifacts: blurs, spots,
and rectangular blocks that weren’t present in the original image. Again, how-
ever, you can choose how many artifacts you’re willing to live with to get a
smaller file.
To export to JPEG, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export➪JPEG Optimizer.
The JPEG Optimizer dialog box appears. It has three tabs. It also has
before-and-after preview windows (left and right, respectively) that
show the effect of your choices. To zoom in or out, click the magnifier
icons. Click the magnifier with the + to zoom in or the one with the – to
zoom out. To view different parts of your image, drag in a window.
2. Click the Quality tab to trade off file size for quality.
Adjust the Set Compression Value To __ value box to a value from 1 to 99.
Higher values make the file smaller, but give it lower quality. You can
see changes in the file size under the right preview window, in the line
Compressed: __ bytes. As you can see in Figure 17-2, you can save lots of
time with comparatively little loss in image quality.
295
Chapter 17: Creating Web Images

A menu offers Chroma Subsampling options. This is deep juju that tells
Paint Shop Pro when to average the color information for any given block
of pixels, and the best subsampling approach is a subject of debate among
graphics professionals. To make things simple, we just say that you
should go with the default value (unless you feel like experimenting).
To see estimates of how fast your file downloads, depending on the
viewer’s Internet connection speed, click the Download Times tab.
A table there gives estimated download times for various connection
speeds. Unless you have specific knowledge that the people who will
view this image have anything faster than a modem, always assume that
they’re running at 56Kbps.
If you can’t get your image to download fast enough, don’t forget that
resizing, as shown in Chapter 11, saves lots of time. Do people really
need to see a poster-size picture of your baby?
3. Click the Format tab to control how the image fades in.
JPEG files normally assemble themselves from top to bottom as they
download to a Web browser. If you would rather have your image fade in
from blurry to detailed, choose Progressive on this tab. Otherwise, leave
the choice set to Standard.
4. Click the OK button.
The familiar Save As dialog box appears.
5. Choose a filename and folder for the file and click OK.

Part V: Taking It to the Street 

The JPEG Wizard
Interestingly enough, the JPEG Wizard is available at the bottom of the
JPEG Optimizer, but it involves clicking more times than the regular JPEG
Optimizer. Our advice is to skip the wizard and just use the Optimizer, which
allows you to see your download time in one click, as opposed to three.
Doing Common Webbish Tricks
Unless you’re Spider-Man, creating Web pages is a complex business. But
Paint Shop Pro can make some aspects of Web design much easier! This sec-
tion describes two tricks that Paint Shop Pro can help you with.
Creating buttons
Paint Shop Pro offers an effect that’s great for creating graphical buttons for
Web pages. The buttonize effect makes any image (or selected part of an
image) look like a raised button by shading around the edges.
Choose Effects➪3D Effects➪Buttonize. The Buttonize adjustment dialog box
that appears offers two styles of button. Click the Solid radio button for a
button that has flat sides (and then choose your color in the palette box),
or choose Transparent Edge for a button with rounded sides. The Buttonize
dialog box also offers three adjustments:
 Height and Width: These controls adjust the vertical and horizontal
dimensions, respectively, of the top surface of the button.
 Opacity: Increasing opacity makes the edges of the button darker,
obscuring the underlying image more.
The right preview window in the Buttonize dialog box shows the result of
your choices.
Matching image colors to HTML colors
You may want to match colors used in your image to colors used in the text
of your Web page — or vice versa. Text colors are often given in cryptic,
geekish codes called hexadecimal in the HTML code used to write Web pages.
They’re written like this: #FFC0FA. These codes always begin with a # symbol,
followed by six characters — digits or the letters A through F.
297
Chapter 17: Creating Web Images

If you’re creating a Web page and want to match the text color to a color in
your image, the Material box can help. Click the Dropper tool on the Tools
toolbar and then click your chosen color. Next, click the Foreground Material
box and select the Color tab. Use the HTML code at the bottom in your Web
page authoring software to set the color of your text.
If you’re creating an image and want to match a color in your image to a text
color, the solution is similar: Click the Material box to bring up the Material
dialog box. In the HTML code value box on the Color tab, enter the HTML
code you obtained from your Web page authoring tool. Click OK and your
chosen color swatch now matches the HTML document’s text color.
Creating Interactive Web Pages
from Graphics
Paint Shop Pro not only creates static Web images (images that just sit there),
but can also create the interactive graphical portion of the Web page itself.
For instance, Paint Shop Pro can help you
 Slice a single image into a multi-image grid and create the Web page that
assembles the pieces into a grid and makes each image a hot link.
 Create graphical rollovers — images that change as you pass your mouse
cursor over them — and write the Web page code to make the rollover
happen.
To accomplish its Webbish wonders, Paint Shop Pro writes HTML files (Web
pages), not just image files. You can then use these HTML files on their own
or copy their HTML code (including JavaScript code) into other Web pages.
You probably need to understand how Web pages, hot links, and rollovers
work before trying to use Paint Shop Pro to make these features. Check out
the Wiley Web site, at www.wiley.com, to find various books on Web pages
and design.
Creating image slices
Professional Web designers rarely design in HTML; instead, they create a 
picture of how they want their Web page to look, using multiple layers and
futzing with it until it looks perfect. Then, when they’re done, they slice that
image into multiple images (known as cells) and assign a link to each cell.
Paint Shop Pro creates the HTML code (a table) that’s necessary to hold the
images in a grid and also creates a series of new images from your original,
single image.
298
Part V: Taking It to the Street 

You can use another technique, called image mapping, but it has two major
disadvantages: The entire image has to download at once before the viewer
can do anything (and haven’t we told you about the importance of speedy
downloads?), and you can’t use rollovers effectively. We advise skipping it
unless you have a pressing need.
To slice an image, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Export➪Image Slicer, as shown in Figure 17-3.
2. Zoom and position your image in the Image Slicer so that you can see
the whole area you intend to slice.
To zoom, click either of the magnifier icons just below the image: + to
zoom in or – to zoom out. To position (pan) your image, click and hold
your mouse button on the Pan icon and drag in the preview window
until you see what you want.

3. Click either the Slice tool or the Grid tool.
The grid divides your image using a grid of evenly spaced lines. You can
adjust the lines and their positions afterward. The Slice tool, although
tricky to control, enables you to slice wherever you like.
4. Slice your image.
If you use the Grid tool, click anywhere on the image. In the Grid Size
dialog box that appears, enter values for the number of rows and
columns in your grid.
If you use the Slice tool, click where you want the center of your cut to
be and drag either horizontally or vertically; the Slice tool creates a hori-
zontal or vertical cut that expands in both directions from where you
originally clicked. You don’t need to drag entirely across the image; the
line automatically extends to the image edge or to the next line it
encounters.
Note that you can use both the Slice Tool and the Grid tool to provide
extremely fine control; for example, you can create a grid of boxes, and
then subdivide each of those boxes with the Slice tool.
5. With the Delete tool, remove any extra lines.
Click the Delete tool in the Tools area and click lines you don’t want.
6. With the Arrow tool, drag any lines that need moving.
If your image has any solid white cells, you can improve the Web page’s
downloading speed by not placing an image in that cell. With the Arrow tool,
click the cell and then clear the Include Cell in Table box. This trick also
works for other solid-color areas, but you have to edit the resulting HTML 
file to set the background color to match the image color.
At this point, you’re ready to enter the hyperlink (Web address) information
that describes what Web page appears when the person viewing your page
clicks a cell (see the following section).
Entering the links
After you have created your hot spot areas or cells, the next step is to enter
the Web address you want each hot spot or cell to link to when someone
clicks it on the Web. Follow these steps:
1. Choose the Arrow tool (in the Tools area) and click a hot spot or cell.
2. Enter the URL (address of the Web page) you want to link to in the
URL text box.
If you intend for the page to appear in a named frame of the current
page, enter the frame name in the Target area.
300
Part V: Taking It to the Street 

3. Enter a text description of that new page in the Alt Text text box.
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 for all the cells you have created.
You may also want to save the work you have done so far, which we describe
how to do in “Saving and reloading your work,” later in this chapter.
Optimizing the cells
Unless you tell it to otherwise, Paint Shop Pro saves all your cells as GIFs,
which can create grainy images and horribly lengthy download times. A little
compression can make all the difference; remember that the JPEG used ear-
lier took four minutes to download before it was squeezed down. Is your page
so cool that you would watch a blank screen for five minutes before you saw
it? (Studies have shown that people don’t wait for longer than 12 seconds.)
To optimize your images:
1. Choose the Arrow tool (in the Tools area) and click a hot spot or cell.
2. Choose whether your cell will be a GIF or a JPEG image.
Refer to Table 17-1 for a comparison of formats. (You can use PNG, but
not all browsers support it.)
3. If you want to optimize the image — and you should — click the
Optimize Cell button.
This step brings up the GIF or the JPEG Optimizer, as discussed earlier
this chapter; pay special attention to the Download Times tab. If you
want all your cells to be optimized the same way, check the Apply
Optimization to Whole Image box.
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 for all cells you have created.
Saving and reloading your work
You may want to go back and change your hot spots, cells, or links later, or
perhaps use similar settings on a slightly different image. For those reasons,
save your work as a file. (Note that this file isn’t the Web page file or an image
file; to create those, see the following section.)
Click the Save Settings button. The Save Slice Settings dialog box that
appears works just like any other file-saving dialog box. Enter a name and
choose a folder for your file, and then click Save.
301
Chapter 17: Creating Web Images

If you want to use or edit your settings later, open the Image Slicer tool as
before and click the Load Settings button. Open your file in the Load Slice
Settings dialog box that appears. The hot spots or cells you defined earlier
are now set up for the current image.
Saving the result as a Web page
For all this slicing and dicing to be of any use, you need to transform it into a
Web file. The Paint Shop Pro Webtools output the two kinds of file you need
for your Web page: one or more image files (in GIF, JPEG, or PNG format) and
a single HTML file. You output as many image files as you have cells. The Web
page (HTML) file you output incorporates those image files and provides the
links, hot spots, and other programming that makes it all work.
Before you output the final files, you can test your Web page by viewing it in
your Web browser. In the Image Slicer, click the Preview button. Your Web
browser launches and displays the result. You can test all the hot spots or
other features you have created.
To output your Web files, click the Save or Save As button. If you haven’t cre-
ated any Web files since you launched the Image Slicer, the Save As dialog
box appears. As with the Save As dialog box in any program, you enter a file-
name and choose a folder. The name and folder you choose is the name and
location of the HTML, or Web page file, you’re creating. (The Save As dialog
box doesn’t appear if your Web page file already has a name and folder.)
Paint Shop Pro creates a series of cell images in the same folder as the HTML
file; although each cell file’s name begins with the name of the original image
file, Paint Shop Pro appends additional characters to distinguish the cell.
Making rollovers
Rollovers are images (typically buttons) that change appearance whenever
you position your mouse over them or whenever you do various other mouse
or keyboard actions. For instance, a button may get darker. Rollovers are
popular Web page features because they provide immediate feedback to the
user’s cursor motion.
The basic mouseover rollover, which we describe here, simply changes as the
mouse passes over it. It requires two images: the original image (a button, for
example) and the one that substitutes for the original when a mouse cursor
passes over it (a darkened version of the button, for instance).
302
Part V: Taking It to the Street 

To create a rollover, follow these steps:
1. Prepare the pair of images for each rollover.
For each rollover, you need the image that first appears on the Web page
and the image that takes the first image’s place. If you like using sliced
images, first use the Image Slicer to slice a large image into separate cell
images and save your settings. Close the Image Slicer, load into Paint
Shop Pro all the cell images created by the slicer, and modify them in
some way; for instance, you can make them darker. Save each one with a
modified file name so that the original cell images remain unchanged.
2. Open the original image in Paint Shop Pro, if it isn’t already open.
For instance, open the large image you originally sliced in Step 1.
3. Launch the Image Slicer and load your earlier settings.
Load the settings you saved in Step 1 to restore the slicing.
4. With the Arrow tool, click in the Image Slicer the cell you want to pro-
gram with a rollover.
5. Click the Rollover Creator button.
The Rollover Creator dialog box appears.
6. Click the Mouse Over check box.
7. Click the file folder icon on the same line as the Mouse Over check box.
The Select Rollover dialog box appears.
8. Choose the image file you want to appear when the mouse passes over
and click Open.
For instance, this file is the darkened version of the original file.
9. Click OK in the Select Rollover dialog box.
10. Repeat Steps 4 through 10 for each cell or hot spot.
Proceed to save your settings and output your Web files as we describe in
earlier sections in this chapter.

T
his timesaving chapter shows you two terrific tools to use when you need
to save time: Scripts record your actions and play them back at super-
speed, and presets save your tool settings and reload them with a click.
Saving Tool and Effect
Settings As Presets
Paint Shop Pro has lots of options for each of its tools and effects, and setting
them all by hand can be tedious. If you painstakingly set the opacity, shape,
blend mode, stroke width, and thickness to get a watercolor-style effect from
the Brush tool, you can save those settings as a single preset. Then, the next
time you want to paint in watercolors, you can load all your carefully tweaked
tool options with a single click — as opposed to having to not only remember
each of the controls’ settings, but also having to set each of them individually.
You can find presets in two separate places, depending on whether the set-
tings you need to save are in a tool, like the Magic Wand, or whether they’re
in a dialog box that pops up whenever you try to apply an effect or adjust-
ment, like the Mosaic effect or the Automatic Color Balance.
 In Effects and Adjustments, the preset controls are along the top of the
dialog box, as shown in Figure 18-1.
 For tools, the presets are in the upper-left corner of the Tool Options
palette. Click the small arrow next to the tool’s icon to display the drop-
down Presets menu.

To save a particular group of settings, set all the dials, slider bars, menus,
colors, and other options to the settings you want to remember — but don’t
do anything else! When you have everything tweaked to perfection, press the
Save Preset button (the one with the little floppy disk) and enter a memorable
name for the effect. Then, the next time you want to call up a group of set-
tings, just choose it from the drop-down menu and it automatically enters all
the numbers you saved.
The preset always comes with at least two entries, in addition to any others
you add to it (although one may be hidden):
 Default: Resets any changes you have made since Paint Shop Pro was
installed, bringing this effect back to its pristine, untouched state.
 Last Used: Automatically saves the settings you used the last time and
loads them the next time you open them. This preset doesn’t show up
on a Tool preset, but it saves your settings nonetheless.
To delete a preset, select it from the list and click the Delete button. You can’t
delete the Default or Last Used presets.
If you feel that you have made too many changes and want things back to the
way they were originally, click the Reset to Default button, which sets the
controls back to the way they were when you first installed Paint Shop Pro.

The Material dialog box has no presets, but you can save textured gradients
and colors as swatches, which are similar to presets; refer to Chapter 3 for
details.
Scripting 101
Scripts are a new Paint Shop Pro 8 feature that allows you to automate repeti-
tive tasks. If you have a bunch of commands you need to do over and over
again — you want to resize an image, buttonize it, and then change its color
to fuchsia, for example — you can record them all as one script and save
them for future use. Then, the next time you need to resize, buttonize, and
fuchsia-ize, you can select the script from a list and click Run. Paint Shop Pro
then replays those commands as you entered them, saving you valuable time.
If you have ever used macros in Word or Excel, the concept is the same.
Scripts have two major advantages over doing tasks by hand: Scripts perform
tasks more quickly than you could ever do them, and the tasks are done flaw-
lessly (assuming that you completed the task flawlessly when you recorded
it, of course).
Recording a script
To have Paint Shop Pro record everything you do in order to play it back
later, the process is as simple as following these steps:
1. If you don’t see the Script toolbar, as shown in Figure 18-2, choose
View➪Toolbars➪Script.
2. Click the Start Script Recording button.

Chapter 18: Automating Paint Shop Pro

3. Perform the sequence of actions you want recorded, just as you would
normally do in Paint Shop Pro.
Keep in mind that the settings for the tools you use are saved within the
script; for example, if you paint a circle with a 50 percent opacity and 
25-pixel brush, that script always draws with a 50 percent opacity, 
25-pixel brush regardless of what the Brush tool may be set to.
4. If you need to pause recording in the middle of a task to do something
you don’t want replayed later, click the Pause Script Recording button.
Click the button again to continue the recording where you left off.
5. When you’re done, click the Save Script Recording button and enter a
name, and then click OK.
Or, if you have done something wrong and you don’t want to save the
script, click the Cancel Script Recording button.
You have two options when saving, but only one is worth mentioning (the
other involves lots of non-For Dummies information): To ensure that the
script draws with the material (the color, gradient, or pattern) you used
when you recorded the script, thus ensuring that a red line is always a red
line, check the Save Materials check box. Leaving it unchecked causes this
script to draw with whatever materials are selected at the time you run it.
You can also, if you’re so inclined, click the Description button and enter the
author, copyright, and description of your script. This option is handy if you
expect to pass the script on to someone else.
Scripts are saved by default in the folder named My Documents\My PSP8
Files\Restricted-Scripts. You can send them to other users, who can put 
them in their folders and run them as though they had been recorded on
their own PCs.
Running a script
Running Paint Shop Pro scripts is much simpler than recording them:
1. Select from the drop-down list on the Script toolbar the script you
want to run.
Note that scripts are already there. Paint Shop Pro has added several
scripts to automate common tasks, like creating thumbnails; feel free to
experiment to see what’s there.
2. Click the Run Selected Script button.
Certain advanced scripts may have dialog boxes that ask for user input, but
most just zip through and go about their business in no time.
308
Part V: Taking It to the Street 

Advanced scripting
Paint Shop Pro scripts are written and recorded in Python, a powerful free-
ware scripting language that helps drive much of the Google search engines
and helped to create the special effects in Star Wars, Episode II: Attack of the
Clones. (Note that although Python is a scripting language, it had nothing to
do with the script for Episode II; that’s George Lucas’s fault. Who dresses up
in a leather backless bustier to break up with her boyfriend, anyway?)
Computer programmers can tell you that Python is a “simple” scripting lan-
guage, but it means that Python is simple to a programmer. To Joe Average,
it’s a darned complex piece of work. Still, if you’re well versed in Python or
you just like a challenge, you can hand-write complex scripting programs that
automate Paint Shop Pro to ridiculous extremes.
If you’re interested in delving into Python, www.python.org/doc/Newbies.
html is a great place to start.

n real life, your paint brush doesn’t suddenly start painting in plaid, your
canvas doesn’t double in size, and (unless you have kids) your tools don’t
suddenly become unavailable. In software, however, all the laws of nature are
repealed and then reformulated by people whose idea of a good time is to
make your brush paint in plaid: software engineers.
When the bright colors you see before you are the result of a migraine and not
paint, this chapter is a good place to start. Take a deep breath, get a chocolate
chip cookie, and repeat, “I am smart, software is stupid. I am smart, software
is stupid.” Then read on.
“The Tool or Command 
Doesn’t Do Anything”
If a tool or command doesn’t seem to do anything as you apply it to an image,
the cause is probably related to selections or layers. Specifically, the problem
may be one of the following:

 You have in your image a selected area (called a selection) that you’re
unaware of. Tools and commands are almost always constrained to
working within a selection, if one exists. Probably you’re either not
working on, or not looking at, that selection. If you don’t really want to
be working within a selection at the moment, simply press Ctrl+D to
remove the selection.
One reason you may be unaware of this selection is that you have 
somehow hidden the selection marquee, the moving dashed line that
indicates a selection’s presence. Choose Selections and examine the
button next to Hide Marquee on the menu that appears. If the button 
has an outline around it, the marquee is hidden. Click Hide Marquee 
to unhide it.
Another reason you may be unaware of the selection is that your image
is larger than the window and the selected area isn’t visible. Zoom out
(right-click with the Zoom tool, the magnifying glass icon on the tool
palette) until you can see the whole image, including the selection 
marquee.
 You’re mistakenly working on an image layer that’s empty (transparent)
in the area you’re trying to work in. Switch to the background layer and
try the tool again. If that doesn’t work, pause the mouse cursor over the
names of the various layers to see tiny, thumbnail images of the contents
of each layer. Click the layer that contains the content you’re trying to
modify. Refer to Chapter 14 for more help with layers.
 You’re painting in exactly the same color as the background you’re
painting on! Change the foreground color or background color (refer to
Chapter 3).
If you have been trying to use a menu command with no apparent effect, you
may have been having an effect within your selection, without knowing it!
When you find the area, check it. If it has been altered unintentionally, press
Ctrl+Z repeatedly until the change goes away.
“Paint Shop Pro Keeps Asking
Me Confusing Questions!”
Many tools have requirements that have to be met before you can use them;
for example, you can’t use any of the tools from the Retouch toolset on an
image that has fewer than 16 million colors, and the Text, Shape, and Pen
tools all require the creation of a new vector layer.
314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Thankfully, Paint Shop Pro is smart enough to automatically take these
actions whenever you use the appropriate tool; for example, try to dodge or
burn on an image containing fewer than 16 million colors and Paint Shop Pro
automatically increases the number of colors for you.
At the time we wrote this book, Paint Shop Pro defaulted to asking you for con-
firmation on all these minor changes — which is annoying because not only do
these questions sound terrifyingly complex, but you also can’t do what you
want until you click OK anyway. It’s sort of like asking, “You can’t leave the
house until the door is open; is it okay if I open it for you?” If you want to go for
a Sunday drive — or any drive — chances are that you’re going to say yes.
You can stop all these confusing questions by choosing File➪Preferences➪
General Program Preferences and clicking the Auto Action tab. Then click the
Always All button and click OK; Paint Shop Pro always takes these actions by
default. (If it turns out that you really didn’t want that door open, pressing
Ctrl+Z undoes your last action, complete with any changes that Paint Shop
Pro made to accomplish it.)
“The Toolbar or Palette Just Isn’t There!”
You can accidentally close or move one of the toolbars or palettes that holds
the tool you need, thus stashing the Paint Brush tool where you can’t get at
it. If you don’t see what you need, choose View➪Toolbars or View➪Palettes
and look for a likely candidate that would contain the tool you’re looking for.
(The main offenders are generally one of these three: View➪Toolbars➪Tools,
View➪Palettes➪Layers, or View➪Palettes➪Materials.)
If the toolbar or palette is open but has been dragged somewhere that it’s not
supposed to be, its icon on the menu has a thin gray box around it; choose it
twice from the menu to “flash” it, turning it off and then on so that you know
where it is. If it doesn’t have a box around it, you have accidentally closed it;
select it to open it again.
“The Image Is the Wrong Size Inside
or Outside Paint Shop Pro”
Paint Shop Pro displays an image in different sizes to fit the Paint Shop Pro
window. The program doesn’t change the size of the image — it just displays
it with a different zoom factor. As a result, an image may look much smaller in
Paint Shop Pro than it does in some other program. To see an image in its
true size in Paint Shop Pro, press Ctrl+Alt+N.
315
Chapter 19: Ten Perplexing Problems

If you need to change the true size of an image — which is the size it usually
appears in other programs (in Web browsers, for example) — refer to
Chapter 11. If you need to change its size as it’s printed on paper, refer to
Chapter 16.
“The Paint Doesn’t Come Out Right”
Paint Shop Pro 8 adds a new Materials box, which can make life complicated if
you’re not sure what’s going on. The usual result is that you end up applying
paint that isn’t what you had in mind. The best solution is to get a good grip on
the Material boxes’ features, so turn to Chapter 3. In addition, settings on the
Tool Options palette can make paint come out in unwanted ways; check
Chapter 4 for help with that topic. Here are a few specific things to check:
 If the paint is too light and kind of dappled, you may be applying a
texture unintentionally. To paint without a texture, see whether the
Texture button (the one in the middle) directly underneath either of the
Material boxes is indented. If one of them is, click them to reset them to
No Texture.
 If the color you’re applying doesn’t match the color in either of the
Foreground or Background Material boxes, you’re applying a gradi-
ent or pattern, not plain paint. Click the Style button (the one on the
left) directly underneath the Material boxes, and drag it up to the solid
circle to resume using plain paint.
 If paint is too thin or too thick, adjust the opacity on the Tool Options
palette; higher opacity makes a thicker paint.
“New Text Appears Whenever
I Try to Change Text”
The Text tool, in its normal vector mode of operation, lets you click existing
text to change it. When you click, the Text dialog box is supposed to appear,
displaying the current text so that you can edit it. You have to click right on
the text character, not the space between characters — not even within a
character’s outline, if that character has no fill! Otherwise, you start creating
new text. The cursor displays an A in brackets, like this, [A], when it’s posi-
tioned correctly for editing text.
316
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

“The Text or Shape Comes Out the Wrong
Color, Texture, or Pattern”
Although you may logically expect your text, drawings, and shapes to appear
in foreground color, sometimes they appear in background color! Sometimes,
too, the colors can be weak or mottled or otherwise weird. Here’s what’s
going on.
Shapes, drawings, and text are made up of outlines in one color and are filled
with another color. The Material box controls those colors. The outlines are
done in foreground color (or gradient or pattern) and in foreground texture —
but outlines can be very thin or even turned off. In that case, nearly all you can
see is the fill color. The fill color is the background color (or gradient or pat-
tern) and background texture (if any). If the background material is turned off
(you see a circle with a slash), you may see very little — just the outline.
If patterns or gradients are unintentionally turned on in the Foreground or
Background Style swatches, the result can be strangely mottled, or even
nearly invisible. Likewise if a texture is turned on for either foreground or
background.
To get plain text, choose a background material and click the Transparent
button (the one on the right), directly underneath the Foreground Material box.
“The Magic Wand Tool
Doesn’t Select Well”
The Magic Wand tool, which selects an area based on color (or other pixel
qualities), is sometimes not so magic. What looks like a perfectly uniform
color to you — one that the wand should be able to select cleanly without
gaps or overlaps into unwanted areas — is apparently not so uniform. You
may find that when you increase the Tolerance setting, you close the gaps
but get more unwanted areas. Here are a couple of things to try besides 
fiddling with the tolerance:
 Try different match modes on the Tool Options palette, choosing RGB
Value, Hue, or Brightness from the menu.
 Don’t fuss any more with the Magic Wand tool. Use it to do the basic
selection job and then use other selection tools to add or subtract from
the selected area. For example, switch to the Freehand tool, set it to
317
Chapter 19: Ten Perplexing Problems

Freehand on the Selection Type menu on the Tool Options palette, and
with the Shift key depressed, drag a circle around any gaps in the selec-
tion. Likewise, hold down the Ctrl key and drag a circle around any
unwanted areas.
 Choose Selections➪Modify to fill in gaps, expand or contract your selec-
tion, or exclude specific colors. Refer to Chapter 12 for details.
“The Tool Works, but Not Like I Want”
The key to a tool’s behavior is its Tool Options palette. For painting tools,
it controls brush size, shape, edge fuzziness, paint thickness, how speckly
the paint comes off, and how close together the individual dots are that make
up a stroke. For other tools, it may also control how the tool chooses what
pixels to operate on (by color, hue, or other attribute) and exactly what effect
the tool has. Refer to Chapter 1 for details about the Tool Options palette,
which you can enable or disable by pressing F4 on the keyboard.
Sometimes, though, the Tool Options palette hides some options from you
because there’s not enough room; look for a small vertical row of single gray
dots on the palette and hover your mouse over it. If the cursor turns into a
double-headed arrow, Paint Shop Pro is hiding some options from you! Click
and drag it down to reveal all the options this tool has to offer. (Sometimes,
Paint Shop Pro hides things with a small rightward arrow; if that’s the case,
just click it and then look for the vertical dotted row.)
“Paint Shop Pro Doesn’t Open Images!”
Have you ever been in line at a grocery store when some rude person shoved
his way in front of you, taking your place? Some programs are equally rude,
but rather than brusquely take your place in line, they take over responsibil-
ity for opening your JPEGs, GIFs, and PNG files without asking you.
You see, when you double-click a file to open it, Windows knows what kind
of file it is and assigns one program to open that file type. Certain poorly
designed programs assign themselves to be that program when you install
them, which can be annoying. To put Paint Shop Pro back in charge, choose
File➪Preferences➪File Format Associations, click Select All, and click OK.
Paint Shop Pro is then your default image handler.
If you’re using Windows XP, double-clicking an image may bring up the
Windows Viewer instead, which gives you a preview of your image; press
Ctrl+E to open it in Paint Shop Pro.

espite all attempts by camera makers to make photography foolproof,
we all still make less-than-perfect pictures. Sometimes, we’re the 
problem — we’re too close or too far away or can’t figure out how to use
the camera’s foolproofing features. Sometimes, the problem is that reality
stubbornly refuses to comply with our expectations: The sky is overcast,
Great-Grandma can’t be present for the family photo, or management has
decided to cancel a product that appears in the product-line photograph.
Fortunately, Paint Shop Pro has a wide range of solutions, ranging from quick-
and-dirty fixes to professional-level retouching. In this chapter, we give you
some of the fastest solutions to the most common problems. Refer to
Chapter 8 for more details and more ways to fix up photos.
Rotating Right-Side Up
Photos that lie on their side are a pain in the neck. Don’t put up with it! Take
these simple steps:

1. Press Ctrl+R — a fast way to pop up the Rotate dialog box.
2. In the Direction area of the dialog box, click either the Right (for clock-
wise rotation) or Left (for counterclockwise rotation) option boxes.
If you have added layers to your photo, click the All Layers check box.
You probably haven’t done so, however, or else your neck would already
be stiff from turning your head sideways!
3. Click OK or press the Enter key on your keyboard.
Chances are, all your sideways photos need rotating in the same direction.
Fortunately, the Rotate dialog box remembers which rotation you chose in
Step 2; for future corrections, all you may need to do is press Ctrl+R and the
Enter key!
Getting the Red Out
Suffering from a little too much red-eye? Photo flashes tend to make the nor-
mally black pupil of the eye glow red. Here’s the fast fix for getting the red
out. It works in nine out of ten cases — where only the pupil is red and the
iris is unaffected; for tougher cases or more finicky retouching, refer to
Chapter 7. Follow these steps:
1. Choose Adjust➪Red-eye Removal.
The Red-eye Removal dialog box appears.
2. In the right preview window, drag the image to center the eye.
3. Click the Zoom In icon (the magnifier with the + sign) repeatedly until
the eye fills the preview windows.
Repeat Step 2 as needed to keep the eye centered.
4. Set Iris Size to zero.
This setting should be zero unless the red covers any of the iris (the col-
ored part of the eye). If the red does affect the iris, refer to Chapter 8 for
help.
5. In the left window, click the red area.
A circle appears in a square frame in the left window. The circle should
be centered on the pupil and cover it to some degree. (If not, refer to
Chapter 7.) In the right window, the red area is partly or entirely obliter-
ated. (If that isn’t true at first, drag the Refine slider a bit to the left.)
320
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

6. Drag the Refine slider left until a bit of red reappears and then to the
right just until that red is gone.
7. Click OK.
Repeat these steps for the other eye.
Photos without Enough Flash
If things are looking a bit dim in a photograph, Paint Shop Pro can often
brighten your outlook. Follow these steps for a too-dim photo:
1. Choose Adjust➪Brightness and Contrast➪Automatic Contrast
Enhancement.
The Automatic Contrast Enhancement dialog box springs into action.
The photo may already show sufficient improvement in the sample in
the right window. If so, click OK and skip the rest of these steps.
The preview window on the right shows the result of any changes in this
and the following steps.
2. To make the picture brighter, click Lighter (on the left).
3. To improve contrast, click Bold (on the right).
4. To get more brightness or contrast, click Normal (in the center).
The Mild option gives you less brightness or contrast.
5. Click OK.
One problem the preceding steps may not solve is feeble colors (inadequate
saturation, in geek-speak). If colors appear a bit too gray, see the section
“Making Colors Zippier,” at the end of this chapter.
If this effect doesn’t do the job, check out Chapter 10 for more help with
brightness, contrast, and saturation. Nothing can restore image data that just
isn’t there, however. Things that are way dim will never look natural — unless
you do some touch-up brushing.
If you can’t see an image well in the right preview window of this dialog
box, click the button with the eye icon to see the effect in the main image
window. Click the button again whenever you want to see the result of your
changes. Refer to Chapter 7 for more help with effect dialog boxes.
321
Chapter 20: Ten Fast Fixes for Photo Failures

Photos with Too Much Flash
If you got a little too close in a flash photo, Paint Shop Pro may be able to
help you back off a bit. Try this fast fix:
1. Choose Adjust➪Brightness and Contrast➪Automatic Contrast
Enhancement.
The Automatic Contrast Enhancement dialog box comes to your aid. The
photo may already look better in the sample in the right window. If so,
click OK and skip the rest of these steps.
The preview window on the right shows the result as you make any
changes in this dialog box. If you can’t see enough of the picture there,
click the button with the magnifier and – icon to zoom out.
2. To make the picture darker, click Darker (on the left).
3. To reduce contrast, click Natural (on the right).
You can try Flat, too, but it’s often too flat.
4. For the maximum darkening, contrast-reducing effect, click Normal
(in the center).
For a lesser effect, click Mild.
5. Click OK.
Photos with way too much flash are washed out, which may be harder to fix.
If, for example, portions of someone’s face are practically white, you need to
restore skin tone without affecting the rest of the picture. A little work with
the Smudge tool (refer to Chapter 6) can help you push skin color into small
white areas. Alternatively, try carefully selecting the entire face area with a
feathered edge and then using the Manual Color Correction effect, which we
describe in Chapter 7, to change the white area to skin tone. (You may have
to disable the Preserve Lightness check box in that effect.)
Revealing Dark Corners
If you need to cast light into the dark corners of your life, Paint Shop Pro can
help. Of course, nothing can reveal totally dark details, and — as in life, itself —
details that are very dark are generally not too attractive anyway, when
brought to light. But, given those limitations, here’s something you can do to
reveal dark corners or other dark areas of your photo.
322
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

This approach is the computer equivalent of an old darkroom trick, known as
dodging. Dodging requires a little eye-hand coordination because you, in
effect, brush lightness and contrast onto just the dark portions of your
photo. Follow these steps:
1. Choose the Dodge tool (the white magnifying glass icon) from the
Retouch toolset.
2. Locate or open the Tool Options palette.
Press F4 on your keyboard to toggle the palette on or off.
3. Make these choices:
Size: To lighten broad areas, the best setting for this value is about
25 percent of the width or height of the image, whichever is larger.
(Image dimensions appear on the status bar, in the lower-right
corner of the Paint Shop Pro window.)
Hardness: Set this option very low, or at zero, unless the dark area
has well-defined edges and you have a steady hand.
Opacity: A good typical setting is about 10. A higher number gives
you a stronger effect per stroke. A lower number gives you a
weaker effect.
Step: A good typical setting is about 25. If you set it too high, you
may see a dotty effect.
Density: Set to 100.
4. Drag over the dark areas of the image to lighten those areas.
Keep the mouse button down and do a first pass over the area. Then
release the mouse button and drag again over areas that need more
lightening. Return to Step 3 and adjust any settings that you think may
be necessary, especially Opacity (strength of effect) or Size. Press Ctrl+Z
to undo your most recent pass at the image, if necessary.
As you brush the image, objects in the dark become brighter and the contrast
against any black or very dark background is increased. The improvement can
be dramatic!
Removing Unwanted Relatives
Removing unwanted relatives is much easier in Paint Shop Pro than in real
life. You’re not limited to relatives, though. You can use the same Paint Shop
Pro tricks to remove other unwanted features, like power lines or passing
automobiles.

Chapter 20: Ten Fast Fixes for Photo Failures

Like removing unwanted relatives in real life, the task requires some skill. It
also requires some sort of continuous or repeated background, like the clap-
boarded side of a building, a grassy field, a rail fence, water, or shrubbery. If
the unwanted relative is blocking more than half of some unique feature (like
a fireplace, chair, or china cabinet), the job gets nearly impossible.
The main tool for the job is the Clone Brush tool, which you use to extend
the background over the unwanted feature. For example, you can brush out
junk on a lawn by brushing lawn, taken from just below or alongside the junk.
Refer to Chapter 5 for a full-fledged example (we removed a mat, but the prin-
ciple is the same). Here’s the general idea:
1. Click the Clone Brush tool (two-brush icon) on the Tools toolbar.
2. Right-click the background you want to brush over your object, in an
area that has no unique features.
For example, if you’re removing lawn junk, right-click in the grass, not
near other junk. Don’t click too near the object you want to remove,
either. Because backgrounds tend to have horizontal strips of stuff, like
grass at the bottom, trees in the middle, and sky at the top, clicking to
the left or right of the object you want to remove usually works best.
3. Drag carefully across the object you want removed.
If, in Step 2, you right-clicked to the left or right of that object, move
the cursor only horizontally before you drag. That precaution ensures
that you extend the correct strip of background and don’t paint grass,
for example, where you want trees. As you brush, the Clone Brush tool
picks up pixels from under an X that starts where you right-clicked and
follows your motion. Keep an eye on the X to make sure that it doesn’t
pick up pixels you don’t want. You may need to reset the X in a new loca-
tion periodically; return to Step 2 to do so.
You probably need some trial and error to get a feel for the process. Press
Ctrl+Z to undo any errors.
One problem with removing relatives and other objects is that if they were
initially blocking a unique object, that object now has a hole in it. For exam-
ple, the relative may well be blocking one arm of a person or half of a piano
(if that relative is fairly wide). Fortunately, many objects are symmetrical; if
Aunt Katy’s left arm is now missing, you may be able to copy her right arm
and paste it in place of the left one. (You can even mirror half a face to make a
whole one in some instances. Results may be unsatisfactory.)
Use any selection tool (the Freehand tool, for example) to select the object
you need to copy (refer to Chapter 12). Press Ctrl+F to float the selection,
press Ctrl+M to mirror it, drag it to the correct position, and then press
324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Ctrl+Shift+F to defloat it. Press Ctrl+D to remove the selection marquee. You
may need to do a little painting and retouching because any light striking the
object is now coming from the wrong direction.
Adding Absent Relatives
If Great-Grandma just couldn’t make the wedding, boost her spirits (or seri-
ously confuse other missing relatives) by creating a picture that includes her
with the happy couple. The same trick works for adding anyone or anything.
Have a new product to add to your product line? Just add it in to the product
family photo. Here are the basic steps, with references to other parts of the
book that provide more detail:
1. Open the original photo (the one without Great-Grandma) in a
window.
2. Press Ctrl+B or choose File➪Browse to open the image browser.
The browser window opens. Arrange the browser and image windows so
that you can see both. (For example, choose Window➪Tile Vertically.)
3. Drag the thumbnail of the new image (Great-Grandma) from the
browser to the main image window.
The new image becomes a new layer of the original photo. You can close
the browser window now. (Click the X in its upper-right corner.)
4. With the Eraser tool (refer to Chapter 4), erase everything except the
part of the new image that you want (leaving Great-Grandma).
5. Click the Deformation tool on the Tools toolbar (second from the top)
and drag the new image (Great-Grandma) to the place you want it.
Refer to Chapter 13 for help with the Deformation tool.
6. If the image isn’t the correct size or rotation, drag the handles
(squares) that appear around the new image to make adjustments.
The image may need some repositioning; if so, drag it from any place
except on one of the handles.
7. Double-click the image, when you’re done sizing and positioning, to
apply the deformation.
Repeat Step 4 to make any additional erasures that you discover are neces-
sary at this point. For example, if Great-Grandma’s head and shoulders are
to appear behind the wedding couple, erase her from shoulders on down.
You’re done! Note that you now have an image with layers, so if you save it,
Paint Shop Pro asks whether you want to merge layers. Reply Yes.

Zapping Zits
One noticeable difference between professionally done portraits and the
ones you (and we) take is that the pros retouch their photos to get rid of
unsightly blemishes. Throughout this book, we describe lots of tools useful
for retouching and even devote one whole chapter (Chapter 6) to retouching
tools. To get rid of a simple blemish, however, is a matter of a few steps.
Zoom in on the blemish and then try these steps:
1. Choose the Smudge tool (the comet streaking to the upper left) from
the Retouching toolset on the Tools toolbar.
(Refer to Chapter 6 for more information about this tool.)
2. Open the Tool Options palette, if it’s not already open.
Press F4 to toggle the window on or off. Refer to Chapter 5 for more
information about this palette.
3. Set the brush size to roughly zit-size on the Tool Options palette.
See the discussions of setting tool options in Chapter 5 for help with
other options.
4. Click just to one side of the blemish, on clear skin of similar (but
unblemished) color.
5. Drag across the blemish.
Dragging along, rather than across, any natural folds or wrinkles is usually
a good idea. Also, don’t drag from one area of unblemished skin color into
a differently colored area.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 from the opposite direction.
Making Gray Skies Blue
Don’t let an overcast day rain on your parade. You can make the skies blue in
a photo, and, even though a snapshot may never look completely natural, it
will probably be more attractive. You can’t make a gray day look too natural
because if it were really taken on a sunny day, the sun would appear to shine
on all the subjects in the photo, casting highlights and shadows. Paint Shop
Pro has several tools you can use. The following steps, however, outline the
simplest approach:
1. Click the Magic Wand tool from the Selection toolset on the Tools 
toolbar.
2. On the Tool Options palette, set Tolerance to about 20 or 30 for a typical
gray sky.
326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Press F4 on the keyboard to toggle the Tool Options palette on or off.
Refer to Chapters 1 and 4 for more information about this window and
its options, like brush size.
3. Click the overcast area of the image, to select it.
If the whole sky isn’t selected, press Ctrl+D to clear the selection, and
then try again with a higher Tolerance value on the Tool Options palette.
If more than sky is selected, try again with a lower value. Chapter 12 has
more ways to help you select just sky.
4. Press Shift+U to open the Red/Green/Blue dialog box.
5. Increase the number in the Blue value box.
As you adjust, keep an eye on the right preview window in the
Red/Green/Blue dialog box, which is showing you the new sky color.
Stop adjusting when you like the color, and click the OK button.
Making Colors Zippier
As we take a photo, we find that our mind’s eye makes the colors livelier than
they turn out to be in reality, and the photo looks a bit dull. Perhaps it’s just
that our antidepressant doses need adjusting, but if you have the same prob-
lem, try adjusting saturation (of your image, that is). Take these steps and
don’t call us in the morning:
1. Choose Adjust➪Hue and Saturation➪Automatic Saturation
Adjustment.
The Automatic Saturation Adjustment dialog box springs into action.
2. Choose the More Colorful option on the left side of the box.
3. If the photo contains a significant amount of skin, click the Skintones
Present check box.
4. Choose the Weak, Normal, or Strong option on the right side of the
box, depending on which choice gives better results in the right pre-
view window.
Click the button with the eye icon whenever you want to see the effect of
your chosen options in the image window.
5. Click OK.
If that doesn’t brighten up your day, check out Chapter 10 or see your
friendly primary care physician.
