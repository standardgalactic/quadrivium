PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
There was no question of “updating” this book nearly thirty years after it was ﬁrst
published—in 1980, volume 100 in the Studies in Logic series of North Holland. The
only completely rewritten sections are 6F, which gives a proof of the determinacy of
Borel sets (a version of Martin’s second proof not available in 1980) and 7F, where
the question of how much choice is needed (especially) to prove Borel determinacy is
examined. There is also a new, brief section 3I on the relativization method of proof,
which has baﬄed some of the not-so-logically minded readers. Beyond that, the main
improvements over the ﬁrst edition are that
- this one has many fewer errors (I hope);
- the bibliography has been completed and expanded with a small selection of
relevant, more recent publications;
- and many passages have been rewritten.
(It has been said that the most basic instinct in man is not for food or sex but to edit
someone else’s writing—and the urge to edit one’s own writing is, apparently, even
stronger.)
There have been two major developments in Descriptive Set Theory since 1980
which have fundamentally changed the subject.
One is the establishment of a robust connection between determinacy hypotheses,
large cardinal axioms and inner model theory, starting with Martin and Steel [1988]
and Woodin [1988], to such an extent that one cannot now understand any of these
parts of set theory without also understanding the others. I have added some “forward
references” to these developments when they touch on questions that were formulated
in the book.
The other is the explosion in applications of Descriptive Set Theory to other parts
of mathematics, cf. Kechris [1995]. This area really took oﬀwith Harrington, Kechris,
and Louveau [1990] which (with the work that followed it) established the study of
deﬁnable equivalence relations on Polish spaces as a subject of its own, with deep
connections to classical mathematics. It was not possible to point to this work in
this revision, especially as the basic result in Silver [1980] was not (for some reason)
included in the original.
Many of the notions and techniques introduced in this book have been used heavily
in these developments, notably scales and the application of eﬀective methods to the
“classical” theory. Some of it has become obsolete, of course; but I do not believe that
its self-contained, foundationally motivated and uniﬁed introduction to the eﬀective
theory and the consequences of determinacy hypotheses has been duplicated.
I am grateful to all those who have sent me comments and corrections, including

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
This book was conceived in the winter of 1970 when I heard that I was getting a Sloan
Fellowship and I thought I would take a year oﬀto write a book. It took a bit longer
than that, but I have many good excuses.
I am grateful to the Sloan Foundation, the National Science Foundation and the
University of California for their ﬁnancial support—and to the Mathematics Depart-
ment at UCLA for the stimulating and pleasant working environment that it provides.
One often sees in prefaces long lists of persons who have contributed to the project
in one way or another and I hope I will be forgiven for not complying with tradition; in
my case any reasonably complete list would have to start with Lebesgue and increase
the size of the book beyond the publisher’s indulgence.
I will, however, mention
my student Chris Freiling who read carefully through the entire ﬁnal version of the
manuscript and corrected all my errors.
My wife Joan is the only person who really knows how much I owe to her and she
is too kind to tell. But I know too.
Finally, my deepest feelings of gratitude and appreciation are reserved for the very
few friends with whom I have spent so many hours during the last ten years arguing
about descriptive set theory; Bob Solovay and Tony Martin in the beginning, Aleko
Kechris, Ken Kunen and Leo Harrington a little later. Their inﬂuence on my work
will be obvious to anyone who glances through this book and I consider them my
teachers—although of course, they are all so much younger than me. No doubt I
would still work in this ﬁeld if they were all priests or generals—but I would not enjoy
it half as much.

Added in proof. I am deeply grateful to Dr. Haimanti Sarbadhikari who read the ﬁrst
seven chapters in proof and corrected all the errors missed by Chris Freiling. I am also
indebted to Anna and Nicholas for their substantial help in constructing the indexes
and to Tony Martin for the sustenance he oﬀered me during the last stages of this
work.

ABOUT THIS BOOK
My aim in this monograph is to give a brief but coherent exposition of the main results
and methods of descriptive set theory. I have made no attempt to be complete; in a
subject so broad this would degenerate into a long catalog of specialized results which
would cover up the main thread. On the contrary, I have tried very hard to be selective,
so that the central ideas stand out.
Much of the material is in the exercises. A very few of them are simple, to test the
reader’s comprehension, and a few more give interesting extensions of the theory or
sidelines. The vast majority of the exercises are an integral part of the monograph and
would be normally billed “theorems.” There are extensive “hints” for them, proofs
really, with some of the details omitted.
I have tried hard to attribute all the important results and ideas to those who invented
them but this was not an easy task and I have undoubtedly made many errors. There
is no suggestion that unattributed results are mine or are published here for the ﬁrst time.
When I do not give credit for something, the most likely explanation is that I could
not determine the correct credit. My own results are immodestly attributed to me,
including those which are ﬁrst published here.
Many of the references are in the historical sections at the end of each chapter. The
paragraphs of these sections are numbered and the footnotes in the body of the text
refer to these paragraphs—each time meaning the section at the end of the chapter
where the reference occurs. In a ﬁrst reading, it is best to skip these historical notes
and read them later, after one is familiar with the material in the chapter.
The order of exposition follows roughly the historical development of the subject,
simply because this seemed the best way to do it. It goes without saying that the
classical results are presented from a modern point of view and using modern notation.
What appeals to me most about descriptive set theory is that to study it you must
really understand so many things: you need a little bit of topology, analysis and logic,
a good deal of recursive function theory and a great deal of set theory, including
constructibility, forcing, large cardinals and determinacy. What makes the writing of
a book on the subject so diﬃcult is that you must explain so many things: a little bit of
topology, analysis and logic, a good deal of recursive function theory, etc. Of course,
one could aim the book at those who already know all the prerequisites, but chances
are that these few potential readers already know descriptive set theory. My aim has
been to make this material accessible to a mathematician whose particular ﬁeld of
specialization could be anything, but who has an interest in set theory, or at least what
used to be called “the theory of pointsets.” He certainly knows whatever little topology
and analysis are required, because he learned that as an undergraduate, and he has
read Halmos’ Naive Set Theory [1960] or a similar text. Beyond that, what he needs to

About this book
read this book is patience and a basic interest in the central problem of descriptive set
theory and deﬁnability theory in general: to ﬁnd and study the characteristic properties
of deﬁnable objects.

INTRODUCTION
The roots of Descriptive Set Theory go back to the work of Borel, Baire and Lebesgue
around the turn of the 20th century, when the young French analysts were trying
to come to grips with the abstract notion of a function introduced by Dirichlet and
Riemann. A function was to be an arbitrary correspondence between objects, with no
regard for any method or procedure by which this correspondence could be established.
They had some doubts whether so general a concept should be accepted; in any
case, it was obvious that all the speciﬁc functions which were studied in practice were
determined by simple analytic expressions, explicit formulas, inﬁnite series and the like.
The problem was to delineate the functions which could be deﬁned by such accepted
methods and search for their characteristic properties, presumably nice properties not
shared by all functions.
Baire was ﬁrst to introduce in his Thesis [1899] what we now call Baire functions (of
several real variables), the smallest set which contains all continuous functions and
is closed under the taking of (pointwise) limits. He gave an inductive deﬁnition: the
continuous functions are of class 0 and for each countable ordinal î, a function is of
class î if it is the limit of a sequence of functions of smaller classes and is not itself
of lower class. Baire, however, concentrated on a detailed study of the functions of
class 1 and 2 and he said little about the general notion beyond the deﬁnition.
The ﬁrst systematic study of deﬁnable functions was Lebesgue’s [1905], Sur les
fonctions repr´esentables analytiquement. This beautiful and seminal paper truly started
the subject of descriptive set theory.
Lebesgue deﬁned the collection of analytically representable functions as the smallest
set which contains all constants and projections (x1, x2, . . . , xn) 7→xi and which is closed
under sums, products and the taking of limits. It is easy to verify that these are precisely
the Baire functions. Lebesgue then showed that there exist Baire functions of every
countable class and that there exist deﬁnable functions which are not analytically
representable. He also deﬁned the Borel measurable functions and showed that they
too coincide with the Baire functions. In fact he proved a much stronger theorem
along these lines which relates the hierarchy of Baire functions with a natural hierarchy
of the Borel measurable sets at each level.
Today we recognize Lebesgue [1905] as a classic work in the theory of deﬁnability.
It introduced and studied systematically several natural notions of deﬁnable functions
and sets and it established the ﬁrst important hierarchy theorems and structure results
for collections of deﬁnable objects. In it we can ﬁnd the origins of many standard
tools and techniques that we use today, for example universal sets and applications of
the Cantor diagonal method to questions of deﬁnability.

Introduction
One of Lebesgue’s results in [1905] identiﬁed the implicitly analytically deﬁnable
functions with the Baire functions. To take a simple case, suppose that f : R2 →R is
analytically representable and for each x, the equation
f(x, y) = 0
has exactly one solution in y. This equation then deﬁnes y implicitly as a function of x;
Lebesgue showed that it is an analytically representable function of x, by an argument
which was “simple, short but false.” The wrong step in the proof was hidden in a
lemma taken as (basically) trivial, that a set in the line which is the projection of a
Borel measurable set in the plane is itself Borel measurable.
Ten years later the error was spotted by Suslin, then a young student of Lusin at
the University of Moscow, who rushed to tell his professor in a scene charmingly
described in Sierpinski [1950].
Suslin called the projections of Borel sets analytic and showed that indeed there
are analytic sets which are not Borel measurable. Together with Lusin they quickly
established most of the basic properties of analytic sets and they announced their
results in two short notes in the Comptes Rendus, Suslin [1917] and Lusin [1917].
The class of analytic sets is rich and complicated but the sets in it are nice. They are
measurable in the sense of Lebesgue, they have the property of Baire and they satisfy
the Continuum Hypothesis, i.e., every uncountable analytic set is equinumerous with
the set of all real numbers. The best result in Suslin [1917] is a characterization of
the Borel measurable sets as precisely those analytic sets which have analytic comple-
ments. Lusin [1917] announced another basic theorem which implied that Lebesgue’s
contention about implicitly analytically deﬁnable functions is true, despite the error in
the original proof.
Suslin died in 1919 and the study of analytic sets was continued mostly by Lusin
and his students in Moscow and by Sierpinski in Warsaw. Because of what Lusin
delicately called “diﬃculties of international communication” those years, they were
isolated from each other and from the wider mathematical community, and there were
very few publications in western journals in the early twenties.
The next signiﬁcant step was the introduction of projective sets by Lusin and Sier-
pinski in 1925: a set is projective if it can be constructed starting with Borel measurable
sets and iterating the operations of projection and complementation. Using later ter-
minology, let us call analytic sets A sets, analytic complements CA sets, projections of
CA sets PCA sets, complements of these CPCA sets, etc. Lusin in his [1925a], [1925b],
[1925c] and Sierpinski [1925] showed that these classes of sets are all distinct and they
established their elementary properties. But it was clear from the very beginning that
the theory of projective sets was not easy. There was no obvious way to extend to
these more complicated sets the regularity properties of Borel and analytic sets; for
example it was an open problem whether analytic complements satisfy the Continuum
Hypothesis or whether PCA sets are Lebesgue measurable.
Another fundamental and diﬃcult problem was posed in Lusin [1930a]. Suppose P
is a subset of the plane; a subset P∗of P uniformizes P if P∗is the graph of a function
and it has the same projection on the line as P, as in the ﬁgure on the opposite page.
The natural question is whether deﬁnable sets admit deﬁnable uniformizations and it
comes up often, for example when we seek “canonical” solutions for y in terms of x
in an equation
f(x, y) = 0.

Lusin and Sierpinski showed that Borel sets can be uniformized by analytic comple-
ments and Lusin also veriﬁed that analytic sets can be projectively uniformized. In a
fundamental advance in the subject, Kondo [1938] completed earlier work of Novikov
and proved that analytic complements and PCA sets can be uniformized by sets in the
same classes. Again, there was no clear method for extending the known techniques
to solve the uniformization problem for the higher projective classes.
As it turned out, the “diﬃculties of the theory of projective sets” which bothered
Lusin from his very ﬁrst publication in the subject could not be overcome by ingenuity
alone. There was an insurmountable technical obstruction to answering the central
open questions in the ﬁeld, since all of them were independent of the axioms of classical
set theory. It goes without saying that the researchers in descriptive set theory were
formulating and trying to prove their assertions within axiomatic Zermelo-Fraenkel
set theory (with choice), as all mathematicians still do, consciously or not.
The ﬁrst independence results were proved by G¨odel, in fact they were by-products
of his famous consistency proof of the Continuum Hypothesis. He announced in his
[1938] that in the model L of constructible sets there is a PCA set which is not Lebesgue
measurable: it follows that one cannot establish in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (with
the Axiom of Choice and even if one assumes the Continuum Hypothesis) that all
PCA sets are Lebesgue measurable. His results were followed up by some people,
notably Mostowski and Kuratowski, but that was another period of “diﬃculties of
international communication” and nothing was published until the late forties. Ad-
dison [1959b] gave the ﬁrst exposition in print of the consistency and independence
results that are obtained by analyzing G¨odel’s L.
The independence of the Continuum Hypothesis was proved by Cohen [1963b],
whose powerful method of forcing was soon after applied to independence questions in
descriptive set theory. One of the most signiﬁcant papers in forcing was Solovay [1970],
where it is shown (among other things) that one can consistently assume the axioms
of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (with choice and even the Continuum Hypothesis)
together with the proposition that all projective sets are Lebesgue measurable; from
this and G¨odel’s work it follows that in classical set theory we can neither prove nor
disprove the Lebesgue measurability of PCA sets.
Similar consistency and independence results were obtained about all the central
problems left open in the classical period of descriptive set theory, say up to 1940.
It says something about the power of the mathematicians working in the ﬁeld those
years, that in almost every instance they obtained the best theorems that could be
proved from the axioms they were assuming.
So the logicians entered the picture in their usual style, as spoilers. There was,
however, another parallel development which brought them in more substantially and

Introduction
in a friendlier role.
Before going into that, let us make a few remarks about the
appropriate context for studying problems of deﬁnability of functions and sets.
We have been recounting the development of descriptive set theory on the real
numbers, but it is obvious that the basic notions are topological in nature and can
be formulated in the context of more general topological spaces. All the important
results can be extended easily to complete, separable, metric spaces. In fact, it was
noticed early on that the theory assumes a particularly simple form on Baire space
N = ùù,
the set of all inﬁnite sequences of natural numbers, topologized with the product
topology (taking ù discrete). The key fact about N is that it is homeomorphic with its
own square N ×N, so that irrelevant problems of dimension do not come up. Results
in the theory are often proved just for N, with the (suitable) generalizations to other
spaces and the reals in particular left for the reader or simply stated without proof.
Let us now go back to a discussion of the impact of logic and logicians on descriptive
set theory.
The fundamental work of G¨odel [1931] on incompleteness phenomena in formal
systems suggested that it should be proﬁtable to delineate and study those functions
(of several variables) on the set ù of natural numbers which are eﬀectively computable.
A great deal of work was done on this problem in the nineteen thirties by Church,
Kleene, Turing, Post and G¨odel among others, from which emerged a coherent and
beautiful theory of computability or recursion. The class of recursive functions (of
several variables) on ù was characterized as the smallest set which contains all the
constants, the successor and the projections (x1, x2, . . . , xn) 7→xi and which is closed
under composition, a form of simple deﬁnition by induction (primitive recursion) and
minimalization, where g is deﬁned from f by the equation
g(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = least w such that f(x1, x2, . . . , xn, w) = 0,
assuming that for each x1, . . . , xn there is a root to the equation
f(x1, . . . , xn, w) = 0.
Church [1936] and independently Turing [1936] proposed the Church-Turing Thesis
(hypothesis) that all number theoretic functions which can be computed eﬀectively by
some algorithm are in fact recursive, and to this date no serious evidence has been
presented to dispute this.
Kleene [1952a], [1952b] extended the theory of recursion to functions
f : ùn × N k →ù
with domain some ﬁnite cartesian product of copies of the natural numbers and Baire
space. For example, a function f : ù × N →ù is recursive (by the natural extension
of the Church-Turing Thesis) if there is an algorithm which will compute f(n, α) given
n and a suﬃciently long initial segment of the inﬁnite sequence α.
A set A ⊆ùn × N k is recursive if its characteristic function is recursive. By the
Church-Turing Thesis again, these are the decidable sets for which we have (at least in
principle) an algorithm for testing membership.
Using recursion theory as his main tool, Kleene developed a rich and intricate
theory of deﬁnability on the natural numbers in the sequence of papers [1943], [1955a],
[1955b], [1955c].

Introduction

The class of arithmetical sets is the smallest family which contains all recursive sets
and is closed under complementation and projection on ù. The analytical sets are
deﬁned similarly, starting with the arithmetical sets and iterating any ﬁnite number of
times the operations of complementation, projection on ù and projection on N. Both
these classes are naturally ramiﬁed into subclasses, much like the subclasses A, CA,
PCA, . . . of projective sets of reals. Notice that the deﬁnitions make sense for subsets
of an arbitrary product space of the form ùn × N k. Kleene, however, was interested
in classifying deﬁnable sets of natural numbers and he stated his ultimate results just
for them. The more complicated product spaces were brought in only so projection
on N could be utilized to deﬁne complicated subsets of ù.
Kleene studied a third notion (discovered independently by Davis [1950] and
Mostowski [1951]) which is substantially more complicated. The class of hyperarith-
metical sets of natural numbers is the smallest family of subsets of ù which contains the
recursive sets and is closed under complementation and “recursive” countable union,
suitably deﬁned. The precise deﬁnition is quite intricate and the proofs of the main
results are subtle, often depending on delicate estimates of the complexity of explicit
and inductive deﬁnitions.
Using later terminology, let us call Σ1
1 the simplest analytical sets of numbers, those
which are projections to ù of arithmetical subsets of ù × N. The most signiﬁcant
result of Kleene [1955c] (and the whole theory for that matter) was a characterization
of the hyperarithmetical sets as precisely those Σ1
1 sets which have Σ1
1 complements.
Now this is clearly reminiscent of Suslin’s characterization of the Borel sets. A closer
look at speciﬁc results reveals a deep resemblance between these two fundamental
theorems and suggests the following analogy between the classical theory and Kleene’s
deﬁnability theory for subsets of ù:
R or N
ù
continuous functions
recursive functions
Borel sets
hyperarithmetical sets
analytic sets
Σ1
1 sets
projective sets
analytical sets.
In fact, the theories of the corresponding classes of objects in this table are so similar,
that one naturally conjectures that Kleene was consciously trying to create an “eﬀective
analog” on the space ù of classical descriptive set theory.
As it happened, Kleene did not know the classical theory, since he was a logician
by trade and at the time that was considered part of topology. Mostowski knew it,
being Polish, and he ﬁrst used classical methods in his [1946], where he obtained
independently many of the results of Kleene [1943]. More signiﬁcantly, Mostowski
introduced the hyperarithmetical sets following closely the classical approach to Borel
sets, as opposed to Kleene’s initial rather diﬀerent deﬁnition in his [1955b].
First to establish ﬁrmly the analogies in the table above was Addison, in his Ph.D.
Thesis [1954] and later in his [1959a]. Over the years and with the work of many
people, what was ﬁrst conceived as “analogies” developed into a general theory which
yields in a uniﬁed manner both the classical results and the theorems of the recursion
theorists; more precisely, this eﬀective theory yields reﬁnements of the classical results
and extensions of the theorems of the recursion theorists.
It is this extended, eﬀective descriptive set theory which concerns us here.

Introduction
Powerful as they are, the methods from logic and recursion theory cannot solve
the “diﬃculties of the theory of projective sets,” since they too are restricted by
the limitations of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. The natural next step was taken in
the fundamental paper Solovay [1969], where for the ﬁrst time strong set theoretic
hypotheses were shown to imply signiﬁcant results about projective sets.
Solovay proved that if there exist measurable cardinals, then PCA sets are Lebesgue
measurable, they have the property of Baire and they satisfy the Continuum Hypothe-
sis. Later, he and Martin proved a diﬃcult uniformization theorem about CPCA sets
in their joint [1969], and Martin [1971] established several deep properties of CPCA
sets, all under the same hypothesis, that there exist measurable cardinals.
For our purposes here, it is not important to know exactly what measurable cardinals
are. Suﬃce it to say that their existence cannot be shown in Zermelo-Fraenkel set
theory and that if they exist, they are terribly large sets: bigger than the continuum,
bigger than the ﬁrst strongly inaccessible cardinal, bigger than the ﬁrst Mahlo cardinal,
etc. It is also fair to add that few people are willing to buy their existence after a casual
look at their deﬁnition. Nevertheless, no one has shown that they do not exist, and
it was known from previous work of Scott, Gaifman, Rowbottom and Silver that the
existence of measurable cardinals implies new and interesting propositions about sets,
even about real numbers. These, however, were metamathematical results, the kind
that only logicians can love. Solovay’s chief contribution was that he used this new
and strange hypothesis to solve natural, mathematical problems posed by Lusin more
than forty years earlier.
Unfortunately, measurable cardinals were not a panacea.
Soon after Solovay’s
original work it was shown by himself, Martin and Silver among others that they do
not resolve the open questions about projective sets beyond the CPCA class, except
for some isolated results about PCPCA sets.
The next step was quite unexpected, even by those actively searching for strong
hypotheses to settle the old open problems. Blackwell [1967] published a new, short
and elegant proof of an old result of Lusin’s about analytic sets, using the determinacy
of open games.
Brieﬂy, an inﬁnite game (of perfect information) on ù is described by an arbitrary
subset A ⊆N of Baire space. We imagine two players I and II successively choosing
natural numbers, with I choosing k0, then II choosing k1, then I choosing k2, etc.;
after an inﬁnite sequence
α = (k0, k1, . . . )
has been speciﬁed in this manner, we say that I wins if α ∈A, II wins if α /∈A. The
game (or the set A which describes it) is determined, if one of the two players has a
winning strategy, a method of playing against arbitrary moves of his opponent which
will always produce a sequence winning for him.
It was known that open games are determined and Blackwell’s proof hinged on that
fact. It was also known that one could prove the existence of non-determined games
using the Axiom of Choice, but no deﬁnable non-determined game on ù had ever
been produced.
Working independently, Addison and Martin realized that Blackwell’s proof could
be lifted to yield new results about the third class of projective sets, if only one as-
sumed the hypothesis that enough projective sets are determined. Soon after, Martin
and Moschovakis again independently used the hypothesis of projective determinacy
to settle a whole slew of old questions about all levels of the projective hierarchy,

see Addison and Moschovakis [1968] and Martin [1968]. Three years later the uni-
formization problem was solved on the same hypothesis in Moschovakis [1971a] and
the methods introduced there led quickly to an almost complete structure theory for
the classes of projective sets, see especially Kechris [1973], [1974], [1975], Martin [1971]
and Moschovakis [1973], [1974c].
This is where matters stand today.


CHAPTER 1
THE BASIC CLASSICAL NOTIONS
Let ù = {0, 1, 2, . . . } be the set of (nonnegative) integers and let R be the set of real
numbers. The main business of Descriptive Set Theory is the study of ù, R and their
subsets, with particular emphasis on the deﬁnable sets of integers and reals. Another
fair name for it is Deﬁnability Theory for the Continuum.
In this ﬁrst chapter we will introduce some of the basic notions of the subject and
we will establish the elementary facts about them.
1A. Perfect Polish spaces
Instead of working speciﬁcally with the reals, we will frame our results in the wider
context of complete, separable metric spaces (Polish spaces) with no isolated points
(perfect). One of the reasons for doing this is the wider applicability of the theory
thus developed. More than that, we often need to look at more complicated spaces in
order to prove results about R.(1–5)
Of course R is a perfect Polish space and so is the real n-space Rn for each n ≥2.
There are two other important examples of such spaces which will play a key role in
the sequel.
Baire space is the set of all inﬁnite sequences of integers (natural numbers),
N = ùù
with the natural product topology, taking ù discrete. The basic neighborhoods are of
the form
N(k0, . . . , kn) = {α ∈N : α(0) = k0, . . . , α(n) = kn},
one for each tuple k0, . . . , kn. We picture N as (the set of inﬁnite branches of) a tree,
where each node splits into countably many one-point extensions, Figure 1A.1.
It is easy to verify that the topology of N is generated by the metric
d(α, â) =



0,
if α = â,
1
least n[α(n) ̸= â(n)] + 1,
if α ̸= â.
Also, N is complete with this metric and the set of ultimately constant sequences is
countable and dense in N, so N is a perfect Polish space.
One can show that N is homeomorphic with the set of irrational numbers, topol-
ogized as a subspace of R. The proof appeals to some basic properties of continued
fractions and does not concern us here—it can be found in any good book on number
theory, for example Hardy and Wright [1960]. Although we will never use this result,
we will ﬁnd it convenient to call the members of N irrationals.

Notice that Baire space is totally disconnected, i.e., the neighborhood base given
above consists of clopen (closed and open) sets.
1A.1. Theorem. For every Polish space M, there is a continuous surjection
ð : N ։ M
of Baire space onto M.
Proof. Fix a countable dense subset
D = {r0, r1, r2, . . . }
of M and to each α ∈N assign the sequence {xα
n } = {xn} by the recursion
x0 = rα(0)
xn+1 =
(
rα(n+1)
if d(xn, rα(n+1)) < 2−n,
xn
if d(xn, rα(n+1)) ≥2−n.
Now for each n,
d(xn, xn+1) < 2−n,
so {xα
n } is Cauchy and we can set
ð(α) = limn→∞xα
n .
It is obvious that ð is continuous since
α(0) = â(0), . . . , α(n) = â(n) =⇒xα
0 = xâ

n = xâ

and check that ð(α) = limn rα(n) = x.
⊣
Another very useful perfect Polish space is the set of all inﬁnite binary sequences
C = ù2,
again with the product topology. This is a compact subspace of N naturally represented
by the complete binary tree. It is obviously homeomorphic with the classical Cantor
set obtained from the closed interval [0, 1] on the line by successively removing the
open middle third, as in Figure 1A.2. Again we will abuse terminology a bit by calling
C the Cantor set.
With each perfect Polish space M we can associate a ﬁxed enumeration
N(M, 0), N(M, 1), N(M, 2), . . .
of a countable set of open nbhds which generates the topology. When M is clearly
understood by the context we will use the simpler notation
N0, N1, N2, . . . .
Of course we may assume that the Ni’s are open balls. There are situations, however,
when this is not convenient. For example, if M = X1 ×X2 is the product of two spaces,
it is often preferable to work with the nbhds of the form B1 × B2, where B1 and B2 are
chosen from bases in X1 and X2.
We will leave open the possibility that the Ni’s are not open balls. However, we will
assume that with each Ni we have associated a center xi and a radius pi such that the
following hold:
(1) xi ∈Ni, if Ni ̸= ∅.
(2) If x ∈Ni, then d(x, xi) < pi.
(3) If x is any point, then for every n we can ﬁnd some Ni such that x ∈Ni and
radius(Ni) < 2−n.
For any set P ⊆M, let
P = closure of P,
so that N s = N(M, s) is the closure of the s’th nbhd in the ﬁxed base for the topology
for M.
The simple construction in the next result will be useful in many situations beyond
the corollary following it.
1A.2. Theorem. Let M be a perfect, Polish space. We can assign to each ﬁnite binary
sequence u = (t0, . . . , tn−1) (ti = 0, 1) an open nbhd Nó(u) ̸= ∅in M so that

(i) if u is a proper initial segment of v, then N ó(v) ⊆Nó(u),
(ii) if u an v are incompatible, then
N ó(u) ∩N ó(v) = ∅,
(iii) if u = (t0, . . . , tn−1) has length n, then radius(Nó(u)) ≤2−n. (See Figure 1A.3.)
Proof. Two sequences u = (t0, . . . , tn−1), v = (s0, . . . , sk−1), are incompatible, if
for some i < n, i < k we have ti ̸= si.
We deﬁne Nó(u) by induction on the length n ofthe binary sequence u = (t0, . . . , tn−1)
starting with some Nó(∅) of radius ≤1 = 2−0 that we assign to the empty sequence.
Given u = (t0, . . . , tn−1) and assuming that Nó(u) has already been deﬁned, we know
that there must be inﬁnitely many points in Nó(u) or else the center of this nbhd would
be isolated. Choose then x ̸= y in Nó(u) and ﬁnd open balls Bx, By with centers x
and y respectively and such that
Bx ⊆Nó(u),
By ⊆Nó(u),
Bx ∩By = ∅,
as in Figure 1A.4.
It is now enough to choose i, j such that Ni ⊆Bx, Nj ⊆By and Ni, Nj have radii
≤2−n−1 and set
ó(t0, . . . , tn−1, 0) = i,
ó(t0, . . . , tn−1, 1) = j.
Veriﬁcation of (i), (ii) and (iii) with this deﬁnition of ó is trivial.

1B. The Borel pointclasses of ﬁnite order
In order to study the subsets of a perfect Polish space M, it will be necessary to
consider other spaces related to M, e.g., the products M × M, N × M, ù × M. Let
us ﬁrst establish notation and terminology which make these detours easy.
We ﬁx once and for all a collection F of metric spaces with the following properties:

Figure 1B.1. The unit ball in a product space.
(1) The discrete space ù, the reals R, Baire space N and the Cantor set C are in F.
(2) Every space in F other than ù is a perfect Polish space.
Except for these restrictions we can leave membership in F open—e.g., one might
take ù, R, N and C to be the only spaces in F. The idea is that we put in F all the
perfect Polish spaces in which we are interested.
The members of F are the basic spaces. A product space (by deﬁnition) is any
cartesian product
X = X1 × · · · × Xk,
where each Xi is basic. Basic spaces count as product spaces by allowing k = 1 here.
We naturally topologize X1 × · · · × Xk as a product, i.e., with basic nbhds of the form
N = B1 × · · · × Bk,
where each Bi is a nbhd in Xi. It is easy to verify that this topology on X is induced
by the metric
d
 (x1, . . . , xk), (y1, . . . , yk)

= maximum{d1(x1, y1), . . . , dk(xk, yk)},
where each di is the given metric on Xi. (See Figure 1B.1.)
Two product spaces X = X1 × · · · × Xk and Y = Y1 × · · · × Yl are equal if k = l
and X1 = Y1, . . . , Xk = Yk. We then deﬁne products of product spaces by going back
to the basic factors, i.e., if
X = X1 × · · · × Xk
and
Y = Y1 × · · · × Yl,
then (by deﬁnition)
X × Y = X1 × · · · × Xk × Y1 × · · · × Yl.
Thus
X × (Y × Z) = (X × Y) × Z = X × Y × Z.
We call the tuples in these product spaces points and the subsets of these spaces
pointsets.
If x = (x1, . . . , xn) and y = (y1, . . . , yl) then (by deﬁnition)
(x, y) = (x1, . . . , xk, y1, . . . , yl).
As with products of product spaces, this pairing operation is associative,

We think of pointsets as sets or as relations with arguments in the basic spaces. Both
points of view are useful and we will use interchangeably the customary notations for
these, i.e., for P ⊆X,
x ∈P ⇐⇒P(x).
Of course we will not be studying individual pointsets so much as collections of
pointsets, call them pointclasses. Thus a pointclass Λ is a collection of sets such that
each P in Λ is a subset of some product space X. For example, we may have
Λ = all open pointsets
= {P : P ⊆X for some product space X and P is open.}
In deﬁnability theory we typically start with a small pointclass Λ and certain oper-
ations on pointsets and then we study the sets which can be constructed by applying
(once or repeatedly) the given operations to the members of Λ. For the Borel sets of
ﬁnite order we start with the open sets and we apply repeatedly the operations of com-
plementation or negation (¬) and projection along ù or existential number quantiﬁcation
(∃ù).
More precisely, if P ⊆X is any pointset, put
¬P = X \ P.
For a pointclass Λ, let
¬Λ = {¬P : P ∈Λ}
be the dual pointclass.
Similarly, if P ⊆X × ù for some X, let
∃ùP = {x ∈X : for some n, P(x, n)}
= {x ∈X : (∃n)P(x, n)}
and for a pointclass Λ put
∃ùΛ = {∃ùP : P ∈Λ, P ⊆X × ù for some X};
see Figure 1B.2.

P(x) ⇐⇒(∃t1)(∀t2)G(x, t1, t2)
with some open G ⊆X × ù × ù. We can rewrite this as
P(x) ⇐⇒(∀s)(∃t1)(∀t2)G(x, t1, t2)
(∗)
since the addition of the vacuous quantiﬁer (∀s) does not aﬀect the meaning of the
equivalence. Now deﬁne
G′(x, s, t1, t2) ⇐⇒G(x, t1, t2)
and notice that G′ is (trivially) open, so equivalence (∗) above establishes that P is Π

1C. Computing with relations; closure properties
The relational notation for pointsets is particularly convenient for putting down
compact expressions for complicated deﬁnitions. Suppose, for example, that Q ⊆
X × N, R ⊆X × N × ù and let
P(x) ⇐⇒(∀α)[Q(x, α) =⇒(∃i)R(x, α, i)].
Here the logical symbols are taken with their customary meaning, as we have been
using them all along: ∀(for all), ∃(there exists), =⇒(implies), & (and), ∨(or), ¬
(not).
We will also use customarily Greek variables α, â, ã, . . . from the beginning of the
alphabet over N and i, j, k, l, m, n, s, t over ù. This will save us having to specify
explicitly the range of the quantiﬁers in each deﬁnition.
One can view the logical symbols as denoting operations on pointsets. In general, a
k-ary pointset operation is a function Φ with domain some set of k-tuples of pointsets
and pointsets as values.
With this terminology, conjunction & is the binary pointset operation which assigns
to every pair P, Q of subsets of the same space X the set P & Q,
x ∈(P & Q) ⇐⇒P(x) & Q(x).

∃YP
Figure 1C.1. Projection along Y.
Of course
P & Q = P ∩Q.
We will however keep the symbol ∩for denoting the general set theoretic operation
of intersection, with A ∩B deﬁned for arbitrary sets A, B.
Similarly, the disjunction P ∨Q of two pointsets is deﬁned when P and Q are subsets
of the same X and
P ∨Q = P ∪Q = {x : P(x) ∨Q(x)}.
Negation is most conveniently regarded as a collection of operations ¬X , one for
each product space X, with ¬XP deﬁned when P ⊆X:
¬XP = X \ P = {x ∈X : ¬P(x)}.
In practice we will always write ¬P for ¬XP, as X is clear from the context.
From these we can construct more pointset operations by composition, e.g., the
implication P =⇒Q of P and Q is deﬁned by
(P =⇒Q) = ¬P ∨Q.
More interesting than these propositional pointset operations are the projections and
dual projections or quantiﬁers. If P ⊆X × Y, put
∃YP = {x ∈X : (∃y)P(x, y)}
as in Figure 1C.1.
For each ﬁxed product space Y, we call the operation ∃Y projection along Y or
existential quantiﬁcation on Y. Clearly ∃YP is deﬁned when P ⊆X × Y for some X,
in which case ∃YP ⊆X.
We have already used projection along ù, ∃ù.
Only the projections along basic spaces are fundamental, since all the others can
be obtained from these by composition; for example, if Y = ù × N, then for each
P ⊆X × ù × N,
∃YP = ∃ù∃N P,
i.e., in relational notation,
(∃y ∈Y)P(x, y) ⇐⇒(∃n)(∃α)P(x, n, α).
If P ⊆X × Y, put
∀YP = ¬∃Y¬P,

i.e.,
x ∈∀YP ⇐⇒¬(∃y ∈Y)¬P(x, y)
⇐⇒(∀y ∈Y)P(x, y).
Fixing Y, we call the operation ∀Y dual projection along Y or universal quantiﬁcation
on Y. Again ∀YP is deﬁned when P ⊆X × Y for some X and then ∀YP ⊆X, see
Figure 1C.2.
In addition to the operations ∃ù, ∀ù, the bounded number quantiﬁers will prove
useful,
(x, n) ∈∃≤P ⇐⇒(∃m ≤n)P(x, m),
(x, n) ∈∀≤P ⇐⇒(∀m ≤n)P(x, m),
see Figure 1C.3.
Clearly ∃≤P, ∀≤P are deﬁned when P ⊆X × ù for some X, in which case both
∃≤P and ∀≤P are also subsets of X × ù.
A pointclass Λ is closed under a k-ary pointset operation Φ if whenever P1, . . . , Pk
are in Λ and Φ(P1, . . . , Pk) is deﬁned, then Φ(P1, . . . , Pk) is also in Λ. For example,
Λ is closed under conjunction if whenever P and Q are subsets of the same space X
and both are in Λ, then P & Q = P ∩Q is in Λ.
Similarly, Λ is closed under negation ¬, if ¬Λ ⊆Λ, i.e., for every P ∈Λ, P ⊆X we
have X \ P ∈Λ.
We say that Λ is closed under continuous substitution if for every continuous function
f : X →Y and every P ∈Λ, P ⊆Y, f−1[P] ∈Λ. Here of course
x ∈f−1[P] ⇐⇒f(x) ∈P ⇐⇒P
 f(x)

.
It is worth putting down a very useful alternative version of this closure property.
1C.1. Lemma. Suppose Λ is a pointclass closed under continuous substitution, let f1 :
X →Y1, . . . , fm : X →Ym be continuous functions and assume that Q ⊆Y1×· · ·×Ym
is a pointset in Λ. If
P(x) ⇐⇒Q

For example, suppose
P(x, y) ⇐⇒Q(y, x) & R(x, y, y),
where Q ⊆Y ×X, R ⊆X ×Y ×Y and both Q and R are in some pointclass Λ closed
under continuous substitution and & . Then P too is in Λ, since
P(x, y) ⇐⇒Q′(x, y) & R′(x, y),
where
Q′(x, y) ⇐⇒Q

f1(x, y) = y,
f2(x, y) = x.
In eﬀect, closure under continuous substitution allows us to permute or identify vari-
ables in a relation and stay in the pointclass we are working with.
After these preliminary remarks we can state concisely the elementary closure prop-
erties of the Borel classes. To prove them, we will need functions that code ﬁnite
sequences of integers by single integers.
Let
p(i) = pi = the i’th prime,
with p0 = 2, and for each n, put
⟨t0, . . . , tn−1⟩= pt0+1
0
· · · · · ptn−1+1
n−1
.
By convention the empty product is 1, so that
⟨∅⟩= 1,

22
1. The basic classical notions
[1C.2
and 1 is the code of the empty sequence. With this particular coding of tuples we
associate the natural decoding functions and relations
Seq(u) ⇐⇒u = 1 or u = ⟨t0, . . . , tn−1⟩for some t0, . . . , tn−1,
lh(u) =

if u = ⟨t0, . . . , tn−1⟩for some t0, . . . , tn−1,
0
otherwise,
(u)i =
(
ti
if u = ⟨t0, . . . , tn−1⟩for some t0, . . . , tn−1 and i < n,
0
otherwise.
It is often convenient to index a ﬁnite sequence starting with 1 rather than 0. Notice
that if
u = ⟨t1, . . . , tn⟩,
then for i < n, (u)i = ti+1.

∃≤P = S
n{(x, n) : (∃m ≤n)P(x, m)},
∀≤P = S
n{(x, n) : (∀m ≤n)P(x, m)}.
Assume now that Σ

n has all the right closure properties—we will show the same for
Σ

n+1.
Suppose ﬁrst that Q is a typical Σ
e

n+1 subset of Y, i.e.,
Q(y) ⇐⇒(∃m)¬P(y, m),

Since P′ is Σ
e

n by 1C.1 and the induction hypothesis, f−1[Q] is Σ
e

This method of proof goes by the fancy name of like quantiﬁer contraction and yields

Proof of closure of Σ

⊣
This simple argument is a good illustration of the advantage of relational (or logical)
notation, i.e., writing
R(x, n) ⇐⇒(∀m ≤n)(∃s)¬P(x, m, s)
rather than
R = ∀≤∃ù¬P.
In fact the whole proof rested on some quantiﬁer manipulation rules whose truth is
transparent in logical notation. We list them here for reference, but we will apply them
in the future without much ado.
(∃s)(∃t)P(s, t) ⇐⇒(∃u)P
 (u)0, (u)1

(∀s)(∀t)P(s, t) ⇐⇒(∀u)P


,
(∃m ≤n)(∀s)P(m, s) ⇐⇒(∀u)(∃m ≤n)P
 m, (u)m

These rules are useful because they allow us to simplify the quantiﬁer preﬁx of a
complicated logical expression by introducing continuous substitutions in the matrix.

P(x) ⇐⇒(∃t)(∃s){¬Q′(x, t, s) ∨(∃u)[R′(x, t, s, u) ∨S′(x, t, s, u)]}
⇐⇒(∃t)(∃s){¬Q′(x, t, s) ∨(∃u)T(x, t, s, u)}

where T, T ′, T ′′ are deﬁned by
T(x, t, s, u) ⇐⇒R′(x, t, s, u) ∨S′(x, t, s, u),
T ′(x, t, s) ⇐⇒(∃u)T(x, t, s, u),
T ′′(x, t, s) ⇐⇒¬Q′(x, t, s) ∨T ′(x, t, s).
Clearly T and T ′ are Σ

by 1B.1 and since ¬Q is also Σ
e

of closure of this pointclass under ∃ù.
This kind of computation is so simple that we will not usually bother to put it down.
One way to make computations of this type with a minimum of writing is to use a

that we use.

For the next exercise we introduce the basic problem of uniformization.(17)
Suppose P ⊆X × Y is a subset of the product X × Y. We say that P∗uniformizes
P, if P∗⊆P and P∗is the graph of a function with domain the projection ∃YP.
Intuitively, P∗assigns to each point in ∃YP just one member of the section or ﬁber
Px = {y : P(x, y)}
as in Figure 1C.5.
It follows from the axiom of choice that each P can be uniformized by some P∗; on
the other hand, it is often very diﬃcult to ﬁnd a deﬁnable uniformizing set, even if the
given set is very simple.
The next exercise solves the uniformization problem in a very simple situation, but
we will see later that even this easy result is useful.

Here we are interested in the case when S is the restriction of a given pointclass Γ to
some product space X,
Γ ↾X = {P ⊆X : P ∈Γ}.
In fact we seek parametrizations of Γ ↾X on product spaces.
If P ⊆Y × X and y ∈Y, let Py be the y-section of P,
Py = {x ∈X : P(y, x)},
as in Figure 1D.1.
A pointset G ⊆Y × X is universal for Γ ↾X, if G is in Γ and the map
y 7→Gy
is a parametrization of Γ ↾X on Y, i.e., for P ⊆X,(15)
P ∈Γ ⇐⇒for some y ∈Y, P = Gy.
A pointclass Γ is Y-parametrized if for every product space X there is some G ⊆Y ×X
which is universal for Γ ↾X.
Let
N0, N1, N2, . . .
be an enumeration of a basis for the topology of some product space X and deﬁne
O ⊆N × X by
O(ε, x) ⇐⇒(∃n)[x ∈Nε(n)].
Clearly O is open and each open set P ⊆X is of the form
P = Oε = S
n Nε(n)
for some ε ∈N, so that O is universal for Σ

N-parametrized. The next theorem establishes a little more.

Proof. Suppose N(Y, 0), N(Y, 1), . . . and N(X, 0), N(X, 1), . . . enumerate bases
for the topology of Y and a ﬁxed product space X respectively. Recall from Theo-
rem 1A.2 that there is a function ó which assigns to each ﬁnite binary sequence u a

in Y such that (i), (ii) and (iii) of 1A.2 hold. Using this ó, deﬁne
G ⊆Y × X by
G(y, x) ⇐⇒there exists a ﬁnite binary sequence u = (t0, . . . , tn) such that
tn = 0, y ∈N
 Y, ó(u)

and x ∈N(X, n).
It is immediate that G is open and hence every section Gy ⊆X is open. The proof
will be complete if we show that every open subset of X is a section of G, since then
G will be universal for Σ
e
0
1 ↾X and X was arbitrary.
If P ⊆X is open, then there is a set of integers A such that
x ∈P ⇐⇒(∃n)[n ∈A & x ∈N(X, n)].
Put
tn =
(
0
if n ∈A,
1
if n /∈A
and as in the proof of 1A.3 deﬁne the sequence {yn} in Y by
yn = the center of N
 Y, ó(t0, . . . , tn)

.
The properties of ó imply that {yn} is Cauchy, so let
y = limn→∞yn.
We claim that for this y,
G(y, x) ⇐⇒x ∈P.
If x ∈P, then for some n we have tn = 0 and x ∈N(X, n), and by the properties
of ó, y ∈N
 Y, ó(t0, . . . , tn)

, so by the deﬁnition of G we have G(y, x).
Conversely, ifG(y, x), then there is some u = (t′
0, t′
1, . . . , t′
n)such thaty ∈N
 Y, ó(u)

and t′
n = 0 and x ∈N(X, n).
Since y ∈N
 Y, ó(t0, t1, . . . , tn)

, the sequences
(t0, . . . , tn) and (t′
0, . . . , t′
n) are compatible by the properties of ó.
But binary se-
quences of the same length are compatible only when they are identical, so t0 =
t′
0, . . . , tn = t′
n = 0, hence tn = 0 and x ∈N(X, n), so x ∈P.

1E. The projective sets
29
Proof. If G ⊆Y × X is universal for Γ ↾X, then ¬G = Y × X \ G is obviously
universal form ¬Γ ↾X. Similarly, if G ⊆Y × X × Z is universal for Γ ↾(X × Z),
deﬁne H ⊆Y × X by
H(y, x) ⇐⇒(∃z)G(y, x, z)
and verify immediately that H is universal for ∃ZΓ ↾X.

The signiﬁcance of parametrizations is evident in the next result which we formulate
in a very general setting.
1D.3. The Hierarchy Lemma. Let Γ be a pointclass such that for every product
space X and every pointset P ⊆X × X in Γ, the diagonal
P′ = {x : P(x, x)}
is also in Γ. If Γ is Y-parametrized, then some P ⊆Y is in Γ but not in ¬Γ.(15)
Proof. Let G ⊆Y × Y be universal for Γ ↾Y and take P = {y : G(y, y)}. By
hypothesis P ∈Γ. If ¬P ∈Γ, then for some ﬁxed y∗∈Y we would have
G(y∗, y) ⇐⇒¬P(y) ⇐⇒¬G(y, y)
which is absurd for y = y∗.

To prove the closure properties of the Lusin pointclasses we need maps that allow
us to code inﬁnite sequences of irrational by single irrationals. Put
(α)i =
 t 7→α(⟨i, t⟩)

,
i.e.,
(α)i = â, where â(t) = α(⟨i, t⟩).
There is a k-ary inverse of this function for each k ≥1,
⟨α0, . . . , αk−1⟩(⟨i, t⟩) = αi(t)
if i < k,
⟨α0, . . . , αk−1⟩(n) = 0
if n ̸= ⟨i, t⟩for all t and i < k.
The maps
(α, i) 7→(α)i,
(α0, . . . , αk−1) 7→⟨α0, . . . , αk−1⟩
are obviously continuous and for each k and i < k,
(⟨α0, . . . , αk−1⟩)i = αi.
It is also useful to have a notation for the shift map,
α⋆= (t 7→α(t + 1)).
Again, α 7→α⋆is continuous.
1E.2. Theorem. Each Lusin pointclass Σ

In particular, every pointset of ﬁnite Borel order is ∆

To prove closure of Σ
e
1
1 under ∨, & , ∃≤, ∀≤and ∃Y we use quantiﬁer contractions.
For example, to prove closure under ∃N , assume that
P(x, α) ⇐⇒(∃â)F (x, α, â)
with F closed. Then
(∃α)P(x, α) ⇐⇒(∃α)(∃â)F (x, α, â)

and ∃N P is Σ

To take one more example, suppose
P(x, m) ⇐⇒(∃â)F (x, m, â).

and closure of Σ

P is the image of N under f followed by the continuous projection function.

1F. Countable operations and the transﬁnite Borel pointclasses
A countable pointset operation is any function Φ with domain some set of inﬁnite
sequences of pointsets and pointsets as values. We will often use the notation
ΦiPi = Φ(P0, P1, P2, . . . ).

34
1. The basic classical notions
[1F.1
The most obvious countable operations are countable conjunction,Vù, and countable
disjunction, Wù. Here Vù
i Pi and Wù
i Pi are deﬁned when all the Pi are subsets of the
same space X and
x ∈Vù
i Pi ⇐⇒V
i Pi(x) ⇐⇒for all i ∈ù, Pi(x),
x ∈Wù
i Pi ⇐⇒W
i Pi(x) ⇐⇒for some i ∈ù, Pi(x).
In set theoretic notation
Vù
i Pi = T
i Pi,
Wù
i Pi = S
i Pi
whenever all the Pi are subsets of the same space.
A pointclass Λ is closed under a countable operation Φ, if whenever P0, P1, . . . are
all in Λ and ΦiPi is deﬁned, then ΦiPi is also in Λ.
1F.1. Theorem. Let Γ be an N-parametrized pointclass which is closed under contin-
uous substitution. If Γ is closed under ∃ù, then it is closed under Wù and if Γ is closed
under ∀ù, then it is also closed under Vù.
Proof. Suppose Pi ⊆X, Pi ∈Γ, let G ⊆N ×X be universal and choose irrationals
εi such that
Pi = Gεi = {x ∈X : G(εi, x)}.
Now pick ε so that for every i,
(ε)i = εi
and set
x ∈P ⇐⇒(∃i)G
 (ε)i, x

.
Clearly P ∈Γ by closure under continuous substitution and ∃ù and P = S
i Pi.
The argument about ∀ù is similar.

If Φ is a k-ary or countable set operation and Λ is a pointclass, put
ΦΛ = {Φ(P0, P1, . . . ) : P0, P1, · · · ∈Λ and Φ(P0, P1, . . . ) is deﬁned}.
We have already used this notation in connection with ∃ù and ∃N .
It is trivial to verify that if Λ is closed under continuous substitution, then
∃ùΛ ⊆Wù Λ,
i.e., every projection along ù of a set in Λ can be written as a countable union of sets
in Λ. This together with 1F.2 give us a new inductive characterization of the ﬁnite
Borel pointclasses,

It is very easy to extend the basic properties of the ﬁnite Borel pointclasses to all
Borel pointclasses and we will leave this for the exercises. We only state here the basic
characterization of the pointclass B of Borel sets,(8)
B = S
î Σ
e
0
î.
1F.3. Theorem. For each product space X the class B ↾X of Borel subsets of X is
the smallest collection of subsets of X which contains the open sets and is closed under
complementation and countable union; similarly, B ↾X is the smallest collection of
subsets of X which contains the open (or the closed ) sets and is closed under countable
union and countable intersection.
Proof. If P is Borel, then P is in Σ
e
0
î for some î, so ¬P = X \ P ∈Σ
e
0
î+1, in
particular, ¬P is Borel. Also, if Pi is Borel for every i, Pi ⊆X, then Pi ⊆Σ
e
0
îi for
some îi, so ¬Pi ∈Σ
e
0
îi+1 and taking
î = supremum{îi + 2 : i = 0, 1, 2, . . . },
we have P ∈Σ
e
0
î, since
P = S
i Pi = S
i
 X \ (X \ Pi)

.
Thus the class of Borel subsets of X is closed under ¬ and Wù.
Conversely, if S is any collection of subsets of X which is closed under ¬ and Wù,
then S clearly contains all open subsets of X and an easy induction on î shows that
P ⊆X, P ∈Σ
e
0
î =⇒P ∈S.
For the second assertion, notice ﬁrst that B ↾X is easily closed under countable
intersection, since
T
i Pi = X \
 S
i(X \ Pi)

.
Conversely, if S contains all the open subsets of X and is closed under both countable
union and countable intersection, then each P ⊆X which is either Σ
e

î or Π
e

î is in S
by a trivial induction on î; because closed sets are countable intersections of open sets

1G. Borel functions and isomorphisms
Let Λ be a ﬁxed pointclass and let
f : X →Y
be a function. We say that f is Λ-measurable, if for each basic nbhd Ns ⊆Y, the
inverse image f−1[Ns] is in Λ. This notion is due to Lebesgue.(10)
Here we are mostly interested in Borel measurable or simply Borel functions. A Borel
isomorphism between two spaces is a bijection
f : X ֌
→Y
such that both f and its inverse are Borel measurable.
The main result of this section is that every perfect product space is both Borel
isomorphic with N and the continuous one-to-one image of some closed subset of
N. We will also show that the Lusin pointclasses are closed under Borel substitution.
Thus in studying projective sets we can often simplify proofs by assuming that the
space under consideration is N.
We will leave for the exercises some very interesting results about Σ
e
0
î-measurable
functions.
Let us ﬁrst dispose of the easy result.
1G.1. Theorem. If f : X →Y is a Borel function and P ⊆Y is in any of the
pointclasses B, ∆
e
1
n, Σ
e
1
n, Π
e
1
n, then f−1[P] is in the same pointclass.
In particular, the collection of Borel functions is closed under composition.

38
1. The basic classical notions
[1G.2
Proof. A simple induction on î shows that if f is Borel and P is Σ
e
0
î, then f−1[P]
is Borel. Thus B is closed under Borel substitution. Also, if f : X →Y, g : Y →Z
are both Borel and h : X →Z is the composition,
h(x) = g
 f(x)

,
then for each open set P ⊆Z,
h−1[P] = f−1
g−1[P]

,
so h−1[P] is Borel and h is Borel measurable.
For the rest, notice that
f(x) = y ⇐⇒V
s[y ∈Ns =⇒f(x) ∈Ns],
so that the graph of f
Graph(f) = {(x, y) : f(x) = y}
is Borel. Now for any P ⊆Y,
P
 f(x)

⇐⇒(∃y)[P(y) & f(x) = y]
⇐⇒(∀y)[P(y) ∨f(x) ̸= y].
These equivalences, the fact that B ⊆∆
e
1
1 and the closure properties of the pointclasses
∆
e

n, Σ
e

n, Π
e

n imply immediately that if P is in one of them, then so is f−1[P].
⊣
We now go to the transfer theorems which often allow us to study just subsets of
N instead of arbitrary pointsets. The ﬁrst of these is a more reﬁned statement of
Theorem 1A.1.(18)
1G.2. Theorem. For every product space X there is a continuous surjection
ð : N ։ X
and a closed set A ⊆N such that ð is one-to-one on A and ð[A] = X. Moreover, there
is a Borel injection
f : X ֌ N
which is precisely the inverse of ð restricted to A, i.e., for all α ∈A, f
 ð(α)

= α and
for all x ∈X, f(x) ∈A and ð
 f(x)

= x.
Proof. To begin with, let
ñ : N ։ X
be the surjection deﬁned in the proof of 1A.1 and for x ∈X, put
g(x) = α,
where
α(n) = least k such that d(x, rk) ≤2−n−2.
It is very simple to check that for all x ∈X, ñ
 g(x)

= x, so g is an injection.
Moreover, if we put
B = g[X],
then g is precisely the inverse of ñ restricted to B, since
α ∈B =⇒α = g(x)
for some x,
=⇒g
 ñ(α)



ñ
 g(x)

= g(x) = α.

1G.2]
1G. Borel functions and isomorphisms
39
If g(x) = α, then
a(n) = k ⇐⇒d(x, rk) ≤2−n−2 & (∀s < k)[d(x, rs) > 2−n−2].
Thus if
Bn,k = {α : α(n) = k},
each g−1[Bn,k] is a Borel subset of X. It follows that for each basic nbhd N = {α :
α(0) = k0, . . . , α(n −1) = kn−1} in N, the set
g−1[N] = g−1[B0,k0] ∩· · · ∩g−1[Bn−1,kn−1]
is Borel and g is a Borel function.
Now, easily
α ∈B ⇐⇒(∀n)


≤2−n−2
&
 ∀k < α(n)

,
so B is a Π
e
0
2 subset of N. We must reﬁne the construction a bit to get ð and A with
the same properties, with A a closed set.
Put B in normal form
α ∈B ⇐⇒(∀n)(∃s)R(α, n, s),
where R is a clopen pointset by 1B.7 and deﬁne A ⊆N × N by
(α, â) ∈A ⇐⇒(∀n)

R
 α, n, â(n)

&
 ∀k < â(n)

¬R(α, n, k)

.
Clearly A is closed. Moreover, the projection ó : N × N →N, ó(α, â) = α takes A
onto B and is one-to-one on A, since
(α, â) ∈A =⇒â(n) = least k such that R(α, n, k).
Hence the composition ð = ñ ◦ó takes A onto X and is continuous, one-to-one.
It is trivial to check that the inverse of ð
f(x) =

g(x), n 7→least k such that R
 g(x), n, k

is Borel. The proof is completed by carrying A to N via some trivial homeomorphism
of N with N × N, e.g., the map
n0, n1, n2, . . . 7→
 (n0, n2, n4, . . . ), (n1, n3, n5, . . . )

.
⊣
The function f of this proof is an example of an interesting class of functions. Let
us temporarily call a function
f : X ֌ Y
a good Borel injection if
(1) f is a Borel injection,
(2) there is a Borel surjection
g : Y ։ X
such that g ◦f is the identity on X, i.e.,
g
 f(x)

= x
(x ∈X).
We refer to any such g as a Borel inverse of f.
It will turn out that every Borel injection is a good Borel injection. This is a special
case of a fairly diﬃcult theorem which we will prove in 2E and again in Chapter 4.
Here we only need show that enough good Borel injections exist.

1. The basic classical notions
[1G.3
Notice that if f : X ֌ Y is a good Borel injection, then
y ∈f[X] ⇐⇒f
 g(y)

= y
with g any Borel inverse of f, so f[X] is a Borel set. Moreover, if P is any Borel
subset of X, then
y ∈f[P] ⇐⇒y ∈f[X] & g(y) ∈P,
so that f[P] is Borel. Thus the image of a Borel set by a good Borel injection is Borel.
It is also immediate that the class of good Borel injections is closed under composi-
tion.
1G.3. Lemma. For every perfect product space X, there are good Borel injections
f : X ֌ N,
h : N ֌ X.
Proof. We have already constructed f in 1G.2.
To construct h, deﬁne ﬁrst h1 : N ֌ C by
h1(α) = â,
where
â(n) =
(

̸= (n)1.
It is trivial to verify that h1 is a Borel function, and
â ∈h1[N] ⇐⇒(∀n)
h
â(n) = â
 ⟨(n)0, (n)1⟩
i
& (∀n)(∀k)

[â(n) = 0 & â(k) = 0 & (n)0 = (k)0] =⇒(n)1 = (k)1
i
& (∀n)(∃k)[â(⟨n, k⟩) = 0],
so that h1[N] is Borel. Deﬁne now g1 : C ։ N by
g1(â) =
(
the constant function 0
if â /∈h1[N],
α
if â ∈h1[N],
where
α(n) = the unique m such that â(⟨n, m⟩) = 0
and verify easily that g1 is a Borel inverse of h1, so that h1 is a good Borel injection.
Now let
ð : C ֌ X
be the continuous injection constructed in 1A.3 with M = X. Since C is compact
and ð is a continuous injection, we know that ð[C] is compact; in any case, we can
compute ð[C] using the function ó of 1A.2,
x ∈ð[C] ⇐⇒V
n

u[u = (t0, . . . , tn−1) for some t0, . . . , tn−1 & x ∈Nó(u)].

ñ(x) ∈B ⇐⇒ñ(x)(0) = k0 & · · · & ñ(x)(n) = kn,
so to prove the ñ is Borel it is enough to show that for each n, the relation
Pn(x) ⇐⇒ñ(x)(n) = 0
is Borel. This is true, since
Pn(x) ⇐⇒x /∈ð[C] ∨W
u[u = (t0, . . . , tn−1)
for some t0, . . . , tn−1 & tn−1 = 0 & x ∈Nó(u)].
Now h = ð ◦h1 is a good Borel injection of N into X.
⊣
1G.4. Theorem. Every perfect product space is Borel isomorphic with N.(18)
Proof. Recall the classical Schr¨oeder-Bernstein Theorem, whose proof constructs
from given injections h : N ֌ X and f : X ֌ N a bijection g : N ֌
→X. We
will verify that if h, f are good Borel injections, then the resulting bijection is a Borel
isomorphism. Deﬁne the sequences of sets N0, N1, . . . , X0, X1, . . . recursively by the
equations
N0 = N
X0 = X
Nn+1 = fh[Nn]
Xn+1 = hf[Xn],
see Diagram 1G.1. An easy induction shows that
Nn ⊇f[Xn] ⊇Nn+1,
Xn ⊇h[Nn] ⊇Xn+1,
so that
N = N0 ⊇f[X0] ⊇N1 ⊇f[X1] ⊇N2 ⊇f[X2] ⊇· · · ,
X = X0 ⊇f[N0] ⊇X1 ⊇f[N1] ⊇X2 ⊇f[N2] ⊇· · · .

n h[Nn] ⊇T
n Xn+1 = X ∗,
and since h is an injection,
h[N ∗] = h[T
n Nn] = T
n h[Nn] = X ∗.
Thus h gives a bijection on N ∗with X ∗. On the other hand,
N = (N0 −f[X0]) ∪(f[X0] −N1) ∪(N1 −f[X1]) ∪(f[X1] −N2) ∪· · · ∪N ∗

Nn \ f[Xn]

= h[Nn] \ hf[Xn] = h[Nn] \ Xn+1,
and similarly, f is a bijection of Xn \ h[Xn] with f[Xn] \ Nn+1. So we have a bijection
of N with X,
g(α) =

if α ∈N ∗or α ∈Nn \ f[Xn] for some n,
f−1(α)
if α /∈N ∗and α ∈f[Xn] \ Nn+1 for some n.
It remains to verify that g is Borel.
Recall that good Borel injections map Borel sets onto Borel sets.
This implies
that all the sets Nn, Xn are Borel, hence N ∗, X ∗and all the diﬀerences Nn \ f[Xn],
f[Xn] \ Nn+1 are Borel. From this it follows immediately that g is Borel.

Let us start with a very simple representation of Borel sets which comes out of 1G.2.
1G.5. Prove that every Borel set is the continuous, injective image of a closed set
of irrationals; i.e., if P ⊆X is Borel, then there exists a continuous ð : N →X and a
closed B ⊆N such that ð is one-to-one on B and ð[B] = P.
Hint. Let C be the class of all P ⊆X which are continuous, injective images of
some closed B ⊆N.
Every closed P is in C: just let ð : N ֌

ð−1[P] ∩A. If P is open, then the same B is the intersection of a closed and an open
set, which makes it Π

a closed set.

Now let D be the class of all P ⊆X such that both P and X \ P are in C. We have

1H. Historical and other remarks
1The early papers in descriptive set theory were all concerned with sets and functions
in real n-space. It was quickly recognized, however, that most results generalized easily
at least to Polish spaces, and soon two tendencies developed: one was to stick with
the reals or the irrationals and prove the strongest possible results, the other to aim
for the widest context in which the basic facts can be established.
2Lusin works in the irrationals in his classic [1930b] and Sierpinski [1950] gives a
brief exposition of the theory for the reals. Among the general books in set theory and
topology which cover descriptive set theory, the three best references are Hausdorﬀ
[1957], Sierpinski [1956] and Kuratowski [1966]. Kuratowski’s book is by far the most
comprehensive of the three and serves as the standard reference for the classical theory.
3In this book we are mostly interested in the theory of deﬁnable sets of real numbers.
To study this, however, we must consider the irrationals and ﬁnite products of copies
of R, N and ù; as it happens, it is no harder and a bit neater to develop the theory for
ﬁnite products of perfect Polish spaces and copies of ù.
4There is no real restriction in taking the basic spaces perfect, since every Polish
space X is a closed subset of the perfect Polish space X × N and results about X can
be easily read oﬀthe results about X × N. On the other hand, there are some deﬁnite
technical advantages to our convention, particularly in the eﬀective theory which we
will study starting with Chapter 3.

1H. Historical and other remarks

5We should pointoutthata large partofthe theory can be developed in a very general
context, in fact many of the basic results have been extended recently to nonseparable
and even nonmetrizable spaces.These extensions are important and signiﬁcant for the
applications of descriptive set theory to set-theoretic topology, functional analysis and
potential theory. The interested reader should consult Christensen [1974], Hoﬀmann-
Jorgensen [1970] and the further references given there.
6In citing classical references, we will not always specify the context in which the
results were ﬁrst proved or give credit for the subsequent generalizations, unless these
involved genuinely new ideas.
7As we mentioned in the introduction, the earliest notions of descriptive set the-
ory were Baire classes of functions on Rn to R, deﬁned in Baire [1899] and studied
extensively in Lebesgue [1905].
8Lebesgue [1905] also introduced the class of Borel measurable sets and deﬁned the
ﬁrst hierarchy on B. According to Lebesgue, a set P ⊆Rn is open of class î if there is
a function f : Rn →R of Baire class î and an interval (a, b) in the line, such that
P = f−1(a, b) = {x : a < f(x) < b};
a set is closed of class î if its complement is open of class î and a set is of row î if it
can be written as a countable intersection of sets which are closed of class < î and is
not itself of class < î. Lebesgue then proved (in our notation) that
P is open of class ≤î ⇐⇒P is Σ
e
0
î+1,
for limit î, P is of row ≤î ⇐⇒P is Π
e
0
î.
9Our own approach of taking the classes Σ
e
0
î and Π
e
0
î as the basic notions traces back
to Hausdorﬀ[1919]. We mention the Lebesgue deﬁnitions here because they were
often used in early papers, through the 1920’s. Another notion often taken as basic is
that of set of Baire-de la Vallee-Poussin class ≤î, ∆
e
0
î+1 set in our terminology.
10Lebesgue [1905] deﬁned the general notion of Λ-measurability and established
that the Baire functions coincide with the Borel measurable functions, as well as the
step-by-step characterization of 1G.17, 1G.20 and 1G.21 with X = Rn, Y = R. The
more general result about arbitrary Polish spaces is due to Banach [1931]. It appears
that the hints to these exercises outline a new proof of Banach’s result—whether new
or not, it is a simple proof which illustrates the value of having the trivial space ù
available as a factor in our product spaces.
11Analytic (Σ
e
1
1) sets were introduced in Suslin [1917]. Suslin’s deﬁnition was in
terms of the operation A which we will study in the next chapter, but he characterized
the analytic sets in R as precisely the projections of Borel (or Gä) sets in the plane. He
also proved the key result that there are analytic sets which are not Borel measurable,
as well as all the simple closure properties of analytic sets, including closure under
projection. In a companion note, Lusin [1917] (essentially) characterized Σ
e
1
1 sets of
reals as the images of R by Σ
e
0
2-measurable functions (1G.12) and proved that every
Borel set is the continuous, injective image of a closed set of irrationals (1G.5).
12Projective sets were introduced by Lusin [1925a], [1925b], [1925c] and (apparently
independently) by Sierpinski [1925].
The main result in both these papers is the
hierarchy property for the Lusin pointclasses on the reals. Somewhat later, Sierpinski
[1928] showed the closure of these classes under countable unions and intersections.
13The ﬁnite Borel pointclasses were not studied separately from the transﬁnite ones
in the classical theory, so it was not noticed that they can be deﬁned using projection

48
1. The basic classical notions
[1H
on ù in a manner analogous to the deﬁnition of projective classes. Our approach here
derives from the work of the recursion theorists, Kleene [1943] and Mostowski [1946].
14Another major diﬀerence between the approach to the subject in the early papers
and the present theory is our heavy use of the operations of logic both in stating and
in establishing the closure properties of the various pointclasses. A good many of
the quantiﬁer rules and logical transformations which we used in 1C and 1E were
ﬁrst applied in the fundamental papers Kuratowski and Tarski [1931] and Kuratowski
[1931], where the connection between descriptive set theory and logic was ﬁrst noticed.
The use of codings of ﬁnite sequences and continuous substitutions to prove closure
properties is essentially due to Kleene.
15Universal sets were introduced by Lusin [1925d], who credits them to Lebesgue
[1905]. The reference is not entirely accurate, as Lebesgue had what we called in 1D
parametrizations (on collections of functions) rather than universal sets, although he
certainly initiated the use of the diagonal method to prove hierarchy results. Many
papers were written on universal sets, proving their existence for various pointclasses
in diverse spaces or constructing speciﬁc universal sets which appeared somehow to
be “natural.” On the other hand, the simple construction in 1D.1 and its Corollar-
ies 1D.2, 1E.3 and 1G.11 seem to have been missed—the strongest result mentioned
in Kuratowski [1966] is that the Borel and Lusin pointclasses are N-parametrized.
Sierpinski [1950] has a general hierarchy lemma, very similar to our 1D.3.
16It is not entirely clear who introduced ﬁrst the notion of separation for sets,
probably Lusin.
The separability of disjoint Π
e
0
î sets by a ∆
e
0
î set was apparently
ﬁrst proved in Sierpinski [1924] and independently by Lavrentieﬀ[1925]. Kuratowski
[1936] deﬁned the reduction property and showed that Σ
e
0
î sets can be reduced by Σ
e
0
î
sets.
17The more fundamental uniformization property was introduced in Lusin [1930a].
Lusin established there some diﬃcult uniformization theorems and introduced the
diﬃcult problem of uniformization of Π
e
1
1 sets. Of course, the question of uniformizing
subsets of X × ù was not considered in the classical theory, since they never studied
the trivial space ù. It comes up naturally in the eﬀective theory and we will come
back to it in the sequel. Notice how useful the trivial 1F.8 is in proving 1F.9, 1G.10
and 1G.20.
18There is a large number of transfer theorems like our 1G.2 and 1G.4 some of them
stronger than the simple ones we have established. Kuratowski [1966] is an excellent
source for results of this kind and for references to the original sources.
19Finally, a word about the “logical” notation of the Σ
e
’s, Π
e
’s and ∆
e
’s which we
have adopted for the Borel and the projective pointclasses. This was introduced by
Addison [1959a] and Shoenﬁeld [1961] and was quickly accepted by the logicians,
though not by all the topologists and set theorists who were working in descriptive set
theory. No other comprehensive system of notation has gained wide acceptance and
it seems that all the reasons given by Addison [1959a] for adopting this one are still
valid today.

CHAPTER 2
κ-SUSLIN AND ë-BOREL
One of the chief motivations for studying projective sets is that we can settle for them
many questions which seem intractable for arbitrary sets. The hierarchy of the Lusin
pointclasses is important because it is often the case that a simple observation about
open sets turns into a deep theorem about Σ
e
1
1 sets, an elegant generalization about Σ
e
1
2
sets and a very diﬃcult problem about Σ
e
1
3 or Σ
e
1
4 sets.
For example, consider the central question of set theory, the continuum problem:
must each uncountable pointset be equinumerous with R? G¨odel and Cohen have
shown that both answers are consistent with the currently accepted axioms of set the-
ory, but it is still open whether the question may be settled on the basis of generally
acceptable properties of sets. In any case, we can try to settle it for speciﬁc point-
classes, preferably large pointclasses that contain most sets encountered in traditional
mathematics.
One of the ﬁrst important results of descriptive set theory was that every uncountable
Σ
e
1
1 set is equinumerous with R. More recently, this has been extended by Solovay and
Mansﬁeld to Σ
e
1
2 and Σ
e
1
3 sets respectively, granting some strong set theoretic axioms
that are unprovable in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. The situation is a bit murkier for
the higher Lusin pointclasses, but there are (very strong) plausible hypotheses which
imply that every uncountable projective set is equinumerous with R.
The same situation occurs with several other regularity properties of sets.
For
example, every Σ
e
1
1 set is absolutely measurable and has the property of Baire. There
are again suitable generalizations of these results to higher Lusin pointclasses, if we
assume strong set theoretic hypotheses.
The central classical result of the theory is Suslin’s Theorem: every ∆
e
1
1 set is Borel.
More than a regularity property, this is a construction principle, since it yields a reduc-
tion of the complicated projection operator (in this simple instance) to an iteration of
the more elementary operations of countable union and complementation. A some-
what weaker construction principle is Sierpinski’s Theorem that every Σ
e
1
2 set is the
union of ℵ1 Borel sets.
In this chapter we will establish some of the basic classical structure results about
Σ
e
1
1 and Σ
e
1
2 pointsets.
Actually we will work with the wider classes of κ-Suslin sets, where κ is any in-
ﬁnite cardinal number—this will ease extension of this theorem to the higher Lusin
pointclasses. The Σ
e
1
1 sets are precisely the ℵ0-Suslin sets and every Σ
e
1
2 set is ℵ1-Suslin.

[2A
2A. The Cantor-Bendixson Theorem
For any set A, let
card(A) = the cardinal number of A.
By 1G.4, every perfect Polish space M is equinumerous with N, hence
card(M) = card(N) = 2ℵ0.
A pointset P ⊆M is perfect if it is closed and has no isolated points—so that if
P ̸= ∅, then P is a perfect Polish subspace of M and again card(P) = 2ℵ0. (We will
often say “perfect” to mean “perfect, non-empty”, when the non-triviality condition
is clear from the context.)
The next result settles the continuum problem for closed sets.
2A.1. The Cantor-Bendixson Theorem. If A is a closed pointset, then
A = P ∪S
where P is perfect, S is countable and P ∩S = ∅. Moreover, there is only one such
decomposition of A into two disjoint sets, one perfect the other countable.
Proof. A point x is a condensation point of A if every nbhd of x intersects A in an
uncountable set. Put
P = {x : x is a condensation point of A},
S = A \ P.
Since condensation points are clearly limit points and A is closed, we have P ⊆A, and
by deﬁnition P ∩S = ∅, A = P ∪S.
We will show that S is countable, P is perfect and if A = P′ ∪S′ with P′ perfect, S′
countable and P′ ∩S′ = ∅, then P′ = P, S′ = S.
To each y ∈S we can assign some basic nbhd N y such that N y ∩A is countable.
Since there are only countably many basic nbhds altogether, there is a countable
sequence N 0, N 1, . . . such that
S ⊆S
i∈ù(N i ∩A)
with each N i ∩A countable, so S is countable.
To prove that P is closed, let x be a limit point of P, N any nbhd of x. Then some
x′ ∈N ∩P, so N is also a nbhd of x′ and it contains uncountably many points of A;
hence x ∈P. To prove P perfect, if x ∈P, then every nbhd of x contains uncountably
many points of A of which only countably many can be in S—hence at least two are
in P.
Finally, assume that A = P′ ∪S′ with P′, S′ as above. If x ∈P′ and N is any nbhd
of x, choose some nbhd N1 of x with N1 ⊆N and check that N1 ∩P′ is a perfect
subset of N1 ∩P′ ⊆N ∩P′, so N ∩P′ is uncountable and hence x ∈P; this proves
P′ ⊆P. On the other hand, if y ∈S′, then there is some nbhd N of y such that
N ∩P′ = ∅, since P′ is closed; hence N ∩A = N ∩S′, i.e., N ∩A is countable and
y ∈S.
⊣
In this canonical decomposition
A = P ∪S
of a closed pointset, we call P the (perfect) kernel and S the scattered part of A.
It is worth putting down explicitly the corollary about the size of closed sets.

2B]
2B. κ-Suslin sets
51
2A.2. Corollary. Every uncountable closed pointset contains a non-empty perfect
subset and hence has cardinality 2ℵ0.
⊣
We can think of the Cantor-Bendixson Theorem as a construction principle, since
it gives us a method of building up the closed sets from the apparently simpler perfect
sets and countable sets.
Exercises
2A.3. A point x is an isolated point of the pointset A if x ∈A and x is not a limit
point of A. Prove that a pointset has at most countably many isolated points.
2A.4. Deﬁne the derivative A′ of a pointset A by
A′ = {x ∈A : x is a limit point of A}.
For ﬁxed closed A, deﬁne by transﬁnite recursion the sets
A0 = A,
Aî+1 = (Aî)′,
Aë = T
î<ë Aî
if ë is a limit ordinal.
Prove that T
î Aî = Aë for a countable ordinal ë, that Aë is perfect (perhaps empty),
and that A \ Aë is countable. (This is an alternative proof of the Cantor-Bendixson
Theorem.)
2B. κ-Suslin sets
Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal number. A pointset P ⊆X is κ-Suslin if there is a
closed set C ⊆X × ùκ such that
P = pC = the projection of C along ùκ,
i.e.,
x ∈P ⇐⇒(∃f ∈ùκ)(x, f) ∈C.
Here we naturally topologize ùκ with the product topology, taking κ discrete, the
typical nbhds being determined by ﬁnite sequences from κ,
N(î0, . . . , în) = {f ∈ùκ : f(0) = î0, . . . , f(n) = în}.
This makes ùκ into a metric space which is perfect but of course not separable if
κ > ℵ0. The set of ultimately constant f ∈ùκ is dense and has cardinality κ.
It is immediate from the deﬁnitions that the Σ
e
1
1 pointsets are precisely the ℵ0-Suslin
or simply Suslin sets. Many of their properties can be proved just as easily for κ-Suslin
sets with κ > ℵ0 and there are applications of these more general results.
In this section we will establish the elementary properties of κ-Suslin sets, start-
ing with the equivalence of the deﬁnition above with two very useful and seemingly
unrelated conditions.(1–5)
Let us take up ﬁrst the representation of κ-Suslin sets in terms of a pointset opera-
tion. A κ-Suslin system is a mapping
u 7→Pu

where f varies over ùκ (cf. Figure 2B.1). Thus

It turns out that the κ-Suslin pointsets are precisely the sets of the form A κ
u Pu, where
each Pu is closed. This is easy enough to prove directly, but we might as well take up
the third condition we will need and prove the equivalence of all three round-robin
style.
A norm on a pointset P is any function
ϕ : P →Ordinals
which assigns an ordinal number ϕ(x) to every x ∈P. If for every x ∈P we have
ϕ(x) < ë, we call ϕ a ë-norm.
A semiscale on P is a sequence
ϕ = {ϕn}n∈ù
of norms on P such that the following limit condition holds: if x0, x1, x2, . . . are in P
and limi→∞xi = x and if for each n the sequence of ordinals
ϕn(x0), ϕn(x1), ϕn(x2), . . .
is ultimately constant, then x ∈P.
We call ϕ = {ϕn}n∈ù a ë-semiscale if every norm ϕn is a ë-norm.
A κ-Suslin system u 7→Pu is regular if the following conditions hold:
(i) Each Pu is the closure Ns of some basic nbhd, perhaps Ns = ∅.
(ii) If the sequence u is an initial segment of the sequence v, then Pu ⊇Pv.
(iii) If u = (î0, . . . , în−1) is a sequence of length n and Pu = Ns, then radius(Ns) ≤
2−n+1.

2B. κ-Suslin sets
53
2B.1. Theorem. For every inﬁnite cardinal κ and every pointset P ⊆X, the following
conditions are equivalent.
(i) P is κ-Suslin, i.e.,
P = pC = {x : (∃f ∈ùκ)C(x, f)}
with a closed C ⊆X × ùκ.
(ii) P admits a κ-semiscale.
(iii) P = A κ
u Pu, where the κ-Suslin system u 7→Pu is regular.
(iv) P = A κ
u Pu with a κ-Suslin system u 7→Pu where each Pu is closed.(1–5)
Proof. (i)=⇒(ii). For each x ∈P, choose some fx ∈ùκ such that (x, fx) ∈C
and put
ϕn(x) = fx(n).
To prove that the sequence ϕ = {ϕn}n∈ù of κ-norms on P is a semiscale, assume that
x0, x1, . . . are in P, that limi→∞xi = x and that for each n and all large i,
ϕn(xi) = fxi(n) = în.
Let
f(n) = în.
Clearly
limi→∞(xi, fxi) = (x, f)
and since for each i, (xi, fxi ) ∈C and C is closed, we have (x, f) ∈C, i.e., x ∈P.
(ii)=⇒(iii). Let ϕ = {ϕn}n∈ù be a κ-semiscale on P. Choose a bijection
ð : κ ֌

ð(î) =

2. κ-Suslin and ë-Borel

such that ϕ0(yn) = î0, . . . , ϕn−1(yn) = în−1.
In particular, limn→∞yn = x and for n > i, ϕi(yn) = îi, so by the basic property of
the semiscale we have x ∈P.

Suslin’s original deﬁnition of analytic sets was via the operation A ,

and the essential content of the equivalences (i) ⇐⇒(iii) ⇐⇒(iv) was already
announced in the basic papers Suslin [1917], Lusin [1917].

2B.2. Theorem. For each cardinal κ ≥ℵ0, the pointclass Sκ is closed under Borel
substitution, ∃Y for every product space Y, countable conjunction, Vù, disjunction of
length κ, Wκ, and the operation A κ.
Moreover, if ë ≤κ, then Së ⊆Sκ; in particular every Σ
e

1 pointset is κ-Suslin.
Proof. Closure of Sκ under continuous substitution is immediate, so we can use it
in the arguments below.
To prove closure under ∃N , suppose C ⊆X × N × ùκ is closed and
P(x, α) ⇐⇒(∃f)C(x, α, f),
so that
(∃α)P(x, α) ⇐⇒(∃α)(∃f)C(x, α, f).
Let
ð(î) =

is a homeomorphism of ùκ with ùù × ùκ = N × ùκ. Thus if we deﬁne
C ∗(x, g) ⇐⇒C(x, g1, g2),

2B. κ-Suslin sets
55
the set C ∗is closed in X × ùκ and
(∃α)P(x, a) ⇐⇒(∃g)C ∗(x, g),
so ∃N P is κ-Suslin.
We can now prove closure of Sκ under ∃Y using closure under ∃N and the fact that
every Y is a continuous image of N.
If Pî = pCî for each î < κ, put
C(x, f) ⇐⇒Cf(0)(x, f⋆),
where by deﬁnition
f⋆(n) = f(n + 1).
Clearly C is closed and
W
î<κ Pî(x) ⇐⇒W
î<κ(∃f)Cî(x, f)
⇐⇒(W
f)Cf(0)(x, f⋆)
⇐⇒(∃f)C(x, f),
hence Wκ
î Pî is κ-Suslin.
Similarly, if Pm = pCm for each m ∈ù, put
C(x, f) ⇐⇒V
m Cm(x, fm),
where
fm(n) = f(⟨m, n⟩)
and notice that C is closed and
V
m Pm(x) ⇐⇒V
m(∃f)Cm(x, f)
⇐⇒(∃f) V
m Cm(x, fm)
⇐⇒(∃f)C(x, f),
so that Vù
m Pm is κ-Suslin.
To prove closure of Sκ under the operation A κ, suppose u 7→Pu is a κ-Suslin system
where for each u,
Pu(x) ⇐⇒(∃g)Cu(x, g),
with Cu closed. Then
x ∈A κ
u Pu ⇐⇒(W
f)(V

⇐⇒(W
f)(V
n)(∃g)Cf↾n(x, g)
⇐⇒(W
f)(∃g)(V
n)Cf↾n(x, gn)
where (as above) gn(m) = g(⟨n, m⟩). Now the set
C(x, f, g) ⇐⇒V
n Cf↾n(x, gn)
is obviously closed in X × ùκ × ùκ, and
x ∈A κ
u Pu ⇐⇒(∃f)(∃g)C(x, f, g).
We can easily ﬁnd a closed C ∗in X × ùκ, such that A κ
u Pu = pC ∗using the obvious
fact that ùκ × ùκ is homeomorphic with ùκ.
If ë ≤κ, then every ë-semiscale on a pointset P is also a κ-semiscale. Hence every
ë-Suslin set is κ-Suslin.

56
2. κ-Suslin and ë-Borel
[2B.3
Closure under Borel substitution follows immediately, since if f : X →Y is Borel
and P = A κ
u Pu with each Pu closed, then
f−1[P] = A κ
u f−1[Pu]
with each f−1[Pu] Borel, hence κ-Suslin. Thus f−1[P] is κ-Suslin by closure un-
der A κ.
⊣
Since every perfect product space is Borel isomorphic with N, the closure of Sκ
under Borel substitution reduces the study of this pointclass to the study of κ-Suslin
sets of irrationals. This is often a useful reduction, especially because of a simple
characterization of such sets in terms of trees which we will establish in the next
section.

1 set has a non-empty perfect subset.
For our purposes, a tree on a (non-empty) set X is a set T of ﬁnite sequences of
members of X such that if u ∈T and v is an initial segment of u, then v ∈T.
We often call the members of T nodes or ﬁnite paths. By deﬁnition, the empty
sequence ∅is a node of every non-empty tree—we call it the root. The terminology is
motivated by the standard picture of a tree, see Figure 2C.1.
A function f ∈ùX is an inﬁnite branch (or path) of a tree T, if for every n,
f ↾n =

2. κ-Suslin and ë-Borel
[2C.1
We let
[T] = {f ∈ùX : f is an inﬁnite branch of T}
be the body of T, the subset of ùX naturally associated with T.
We are particularly interested in trees of pairs, where we take
X = ù × κ
with some inﬁnite cardinal κ. There is an obvious bijection of ù(ù × κ) with ùù × ùκ
= N × ùκ which sends g ∈ù(ù × κ) to (α, f), where
g(n) =
 α(n), f(n)

.
(∗)
Let us agree that when T is a tree on ù × κ for some κ, then we will take the body of
T to be the obvious subset of N × ùκ,
[T] =

 α(0), f(0)

, . . . ,
 α(n −1), f(n −1)

o
.
One could raise a pedantic objection to this ambiguous use of the symbol [T], but it
will cause no problems. It will always be clear from the context when we consider T
to be a tree of pairs.
We will simplify notation further by denoting an arbitrary sequence
 (t0, î0), . . . , (tn−1, în−1)

in ù × κ by
 t0, î0, . . . , tn−1, în−1

.
There is no point to putting down all these parentheses. Thus if T is a tree on ù × κ,
[T] =

(α, f) : for all n,
 α(0), f(0), . . . , α(n −1), f(n −1)


2C.1. Theorem. For each non-empty set X, put the product topology on ùX, taking
X discrete; then a set C ⊆ùX is closed if and only if there is a tree T on X such that C
is the body of T,
C = [T].
Similarly, for each cardinal κ ≥ℵ0, a set C ⊆N × ùκ is closed if and only if there is a
tree T of pairs on ù × κ such that
C = [T] =

(α, f) : for all n,
 α(0), f(0), . . . , α(n −1), f(n −1)


;
hence a set of irrationals
P ⊆N
is κ-Suslin if and only if there is tree T on ù × κ such that
P = p[T] =

α : (∃f)(∀n)
 α(0), f(0), . . . , α(n −1), f(n −1)

Proof. It is enough to prove the ﬁrst assertion, from which the second follows
immediately, by the deﬁnition of κ-Suslin sets and the obvious fact that the map
g 7→(α, f) deﬁned by (∗) above is a homeomorphism of ù(ù × κ) with N × ùκ.
Suppose T is a tree on X and f /∈[T]; then for some n,
 f(0), . . . , f(n −1)

/∈T,
so that the basic nbhd {g : g(0) = f(0), . . . , g(n −1) = f(n −1)} of ùX is disjoint
from [T] and hence the complement of [T] is open.
Conversely, if C ⊆ùX is closed, put
T =
 f(0), . . . , f(n −1)

: f ∈C
	
;
clearly C ⊆[T] and C is dense in [T], so C = [T].

Two ﬁnite sequences u and v from X are compatible if they have a common exten-
sion—i.e., if there is some w such that both u and v are initial segments of w. This
simply means that either u = v or one of u and v is an initial segment of the other.
For each tree T on X and each ﬁnite sequence u from X, let (cf. Figure 2C.2)
Tu = {v ∈T : v is compatible with u}.
Evidently Tu is always a tree, the result of pruning all the side branches of T below u.
In particular,
T∅= T.
Notice that if u = (x0, . . . , xn−1) is a sequence of length n, then
[Tu] = [T] ∩{f ∈ùX : f ↾n = u}
= S
x∈X [Tub(x)],
where of course for each x ∈X,
ub(x) = (x0, . . . , xn−1)b(x) = (x0, . . . , xn−1, x).
In connection with projections of trees of pairs, notice that if
u = (t0, î0, . . . , tn−1, în−1)
is a ﬁnite sequence from ù × κ, then
[Tu] = S
t<ù,î<κ[Tub(t,î)],
so that
p[Tu] = S
t<ù,î<κ p[Tub(t,î)].
We could prove the next result by an adaptation of the topological argument we
used to establish the Cantor-Bendixson Theorem 2A.1. It will be more informative,
however, to extend the argument of 2A.4. The use of trees is not essential in this
instance, but they do make the proof neater.
2C.2. The Perfect Set Theorem (Suslin, Mansﬁeld). Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal
and assume that P is a κ-Suslin pointset with more than κ elements. Then P has a
non-empty perfect subset.(7)

2. κ-Suslin and ë-Borel
[2C.2
Proof. Suppose we know the result for every subset of N and P is a κ-Suslin subset
of some perfect product space X. Let
ð : N ։ X
be the continuous surjection of N onto X guaranteed by 1G.2 and such that for some
Π
e
0
1 set A ⊆N, ð is one-to-one on A and ð[A] = X. Take P′ = ð−1[P] ∩A. Now
P′ is a κ-Suslin subset of N with more than κ elements, so it has a perfect subset Q.
This Q must contain a non-empty perfect compact set Q0—to see this apply 1A.3 with
M = Q, considered as a subspace of N. Hence ð[Q0] is a perfect subset of P, since
the continuous one-to-one image of a perfect compact set is easily perfect.
To establish the result for subsets of N, let P ⊆N be κ-Suslin and choose a tree T
on ù × κ such that
P = p[T] = {α : (∃f ∈ùκ)(α, f) ∈[T]}.
Deﬁne by transﬁnite recursion the sets T î ⊆T,
T 0 = T,
T î+1 = {u ∈T î : p[T î
u ] has more than one (irrational) element},
T ë = T
î<ë T î,
if ë is a limit ordinal.
It is immediate that each T î is a tree and
ç < î =⇒T ç ⊇T î.
There are at most κ nodes in T, so there must be some ordinal ë of cardinality κ
(ë < κ+) such that
T ë+1 = T ë.
Choose the least such ë and put
S = T ë.
The heart of the proof is the following simple lemma about S.
Lemma. S ̸= ∅.
Proof. Assume S = ∅, towards a contradiction.
For each α ∈P = p[T] choose f ∈ùκ so that (α, f) ∈[T] and notice that there
must exist some î < ë such that
(α, f) ∈[T î] \ [T î+1];
this is because (α, f) ̸∈[T ë] and for limit æ,
(α, f) ∈[T ç], all ç < æ =⇒(α, f) ∈[T æ].
It follows that for some n,
u =
 α(0), f(0), α(1), f(1), . . . , α(n −1), f(n −1)

/∈T î+1,
i.e., by deﬁnition
p[T î
u ] has at most one element.
Thus we have shown that
P ⊆S{p[T î
u ] : î ≤ë, u ∈T î \ T î+1}
which is absurd since the set on the right is the union of at most κ singletons and P
has cardinality greater than κ.

patible in the ﬁrst coordinate just in case ti ̸= si for some i < n, i < m. It is immediate
that every u in S has extensions u′, u′′ which are incompatible in the ﬁrst coordinate—
otherwise p[Su] would have at most one irrational in it and u /∈T ë+1 = T ë = S.
We now imitate the proof of 1A.2. For each u ∈S, let l(u), r(u) be extensions of
u in S which are incompatible in the ﬁrst coordinate and for each f ∈ù2 deﬁne the

2D. Wellfounded trees
A tree T on X is wellfounded if [T] = ∅, i.e., if T has no inﬁnite branches. The name
comes from considering the relation of proper extension of ﬁnite sequences from X,
u ≻v ⇐⇒u is a proper initial segment of v.
Clearly T is well founded if and only if the restriction of ≻to T has no inﬁnite
descending chains.
Here we discuss brieﬂy proof by (backwards) bar induction and deﬁnition by bar
recursion on a wellfounded tree, which we will need in the next section. We will also
introduce rank functions on wellfounded trees and use them to prove that Σ
e
1
2 pointsets
are ℵ1-Suslin.
Let T be a wellfounded tree on X and suppose P is a relation on the ﬁnite sequences
from X such that:
if P
 ub(x)

holds for every ub(x) ∈T, then P(u) holds.
(∗)
It follows that P(u) must hold for every sequence u ∈X; otherwise there is some u0
such that ¬P(u0), hence there is some x0 with u0b(x0) ∈T and ¬P
 u0b(x0)

, hence
there is some x1 sith u0b(x0, x1) ∈T and ¬P
 u0b(x0, x1)

, etc., so we get an inﬁnite
branch u0b(x0, x1, x2, . . . ) in T contradicting [T] = ∅. This method of proof is called
backwards or bar induction on T.
In the same way we can justify deﬁnition by backwards or bar recursion on a well-
founded tree T: in order to deﬁne F (u) for every ﬁnite sequence u from X, it is enough
to show how to compute F (u) if we know F
 ub(x)

for every ub(x) ∈T.
Formally, a function F (u) is deﬁned by bar recursion if we are given an equation of
the form

with G a given function. We then put

and show by bar induction on T that for every u there is exactly one z such that
R(u, z), so we can set
F (u) = the unique z such that R(u, z).
This clearly satisﬁes the given equation. Another simple bar induction shows that no
other F ′ can satisfy the determining equation.
A rank function for a tree T on X is any mapping ñ deﬁned on all the ﬁnite sequences

 ub(x)

.

2D.1]
2D. Wellfounded trees
63
The next result is trivial but useful enough to deserve billing as a theorem.
2D.1. Theorem. A tree T on X is wellfounded if and only if it admits a rank function.
Moreover, if card(X) = κ and T is wellfounded, then T admits a rank function ñ such
that for every u,
ñ(u) < κ+ = the least cardinal > κ.
Proof. If T admits a rank function ñ, then T is obviously wellfounded since any
inﬁnite branch
f = (x0, x1, x2, . . . )
in T would deﬁne the inﬁnite decreasing sequence of ordinals
ñ(x0) > ñ(x0, x1) > ñ(x0, x1, x2) > · · · .
Conversely, if T is wellfounded, we can deﬁne ñ on T by bar recursion,
ñ(u) = 0
if u is terminal in T or u /∈T,
ñ(u) = supremum

ñ
 ub(x)

+ 1 : ub(x) ∈T
	
if u is not terminal.
Actually the second equation suﬃces if we adopt the useful convention
supremum(∅) = 0.
It is immediate that ñ is a rank function on T.
Fix now this canonical ñ associated with a wellfounded tree T ̸= ∅.
A trivial
induction on î shows that
if ñ(u) = î, then for every æ < î there is some v which extends u such that
ñ(v) = æ.
Thus the range of ñ is an initial segment of ordinals, i.e., ñ is onto ë = ñ(∅) + 1. For
each î < ë, choose some uî ∈T such that ñ(uî) = î. Now the map
î 7→uî
establishes a one-to-one correspondence of ë with a subset of T, which has cardinality
κ, so that ë < κ+.
⊣
We will sometimes distinguish the rank function ñ associated with a wellfounded
tree T in this proof and call it the rank function of T,
ñ = ñT.
The length of T is deﬁned by
|T| = supremum{ñT(u) : u ∈T}.
If T ̸= ∅, then clearly |T| = ñT(∅).
The notion of a wellfounded tree gives an alternative way of putting down the
characterization of κ-Suslin sets of irrationals of 2C.1. If T is a tree on ù × κ, and
α ∈N, put
T(α) =

(î0, . . . , în−1) :
 α(0), î0, . . . , α(n −1), în−1

∈T
	
.
Evidently T(α) is a tree on κ. It is important to notice that with this notation, whether
(î0, . . . , în−1) is in T(α) or not depends only on the ﬁrst n values of α, i.e.,
α ↾n = â ↾n =⇒[(î0, . . . , în−1) ∈T(α) ⇐⇒(î0, . . . , în−1) ∈T(â)].

[2D.2
2D.2. Theorem. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal and P ⊆N a set of irrationals. Then
P is κ-Suslin if and only if there is a tree T on ù × κ such that
P(α) ⇐⇒T(α) is not wellfounded.
⊣
We now put these two results to good use.
2D.3. Theorem (Shoenﬁeld). (5) Every Σ
e
1
2 pointset is ℵ1-Suslin.
Proof. By 2B.2, it is enough to show that every Π
e
1
1 set of irrationals is ℵ1-Suslin.
Assume then that T is a tree on ù × ù and
P(α) ⇐⇒T(α) is wellfounded
⇐⇒T(α) admits a rank function into ℵ1.
By 2D.2 and 2D.1 every Π
e
1
1 set P ⊆N can be represented in this way. The idea of the
proof is to deﬁne a tree S on ù × ℵ1 such that every inﬁnite branch of S(α) codes a
rank function of T(α).
Let u0, u1, u2, . . . be an enumeration of all ﬁnite sequences from ù such that
length(un) ≤n.
This is easy to arrange. For each n then, un = (s0, . . . , sk−1) with some k ≤n. We call
u = (s0, . . . , sk−1) T-compatible with t0, . . . , tm−1, if
k ≤m and (t0, s0, tk−1, sk−1) ∈T.
Put
(t0, î0, . . . , tn−1, în−1) ∈S ⇐⇒for every i, j < n, if ui, uj are
T-compatible with (t0, . . . , tn−1) and ui is
an initial segment of uj, then îi > îj.
Easily S is a tree on ù × ℵ1. The claim is that
P(α) ⇐⇒S(α) is not wellfounded.
Notice that for any ﬁxed α and u = (s0, . . . , sk−1),
u is T-compatible with
 α(0), . . . , α(n −1)

⇐⇒k ≤n &
 α(0), s0, . . . , α(k −1), sk−1

∈T
⇐⇒k ≤n & u ∈T(α).
Using the condition length(un) ≤n we then have
(î0, . . . , în−1) ∈S(α) ⇐⇒
 α(0), î0, . . . , α(n −1), în−1

∈S
⇐⇒for every i, j < n, if ui, uj are in T(α) and
ui is an initial segment of uj, then îi > îj.
This observation implies immediately that if (î0, î1, . . . ) is an inﬁnite branch of
S(α), then the mapping
ui 7→îi
is a rank function on T(α), so that T(α) is wellfounded.
Conversely, if T(α) is
wellfounded, let ñ be a rank function on T(α), put îi = ñ(ui) and check immediately
that (î0, î1, . . . ) is an inﬁnite branch of S(α), so that S(α) is not wellfounded.

2E. The Suslin Theorem
Fix a space X and an ordinal ë > ù. A collection C of subsets of X is a ë-algebra if
∅∈C and C is closed under complementation and unions of length less than ë, i.e.,
î < ë and for all ç < î, Aç ∈C =⇒S
ç<î Aç ∈C.
If ù < ë < ℵ1, this simply means that C is closed under complementation and
countable unions, and in this case we say that C is a ó-algebra.
The collection Bë ↾X of ë-Borel subsets of X is the least ë-algebra on Xwhich
contains all open sets and Bë is the pointclass of ë-Borel pointsets in all product
spaces.
Clearly, Bù+1 is the pointclass of Borel measurable sets as we deﬁned them in 1F.
Also, Bù+1 = Bℵ1, and in general, if ë is not a cardinal, then Bë = Bë+. It will be
convenient to have Bë deﬁned for all ë > ù.
Let B′
ë be the collection of all ë-Borel pointsets P ⊆Y, such that for every Borel
function f : X →Y, f−1[P] is ë-Borel. Clearly B′
ë contains all open sets and is closed
under ¬ and unions of length less than ë, hence B′
ë = Bë and Bë is closed under Borel
substitution. We will leave for the exercises the remaining easy closure properties of
Bë. Here we want to concentrate on the Strong Separation Theorem and its corollary,
the Suslin Theorem which is the chief construction principle of classical descriptive
set theory.
Recall from 1C that a set C separates A from B if A ⊆C, B ∩C = ∅(see
Figure 2E.1).
2E.1. The Strong Separation Theorem (Lusin). Suppose κ is an inﬁnite cardinal
and A, B are disjoint κ-Suslin subsets of some perfect product space X. There exists a
(κ + 1)-Borel set C which separates A from B.(8)
Proof. We may assume that A, B are subsets of N, since X is Borel isomorphic
with N and both Sκ and Bκ+1 are closed under Borel substitution.
The key to the proof is the following simple combinatorial fact about separating
sets. Suppose
A = S
i∈I Ai,
B = S
j∈J Bj

66
2. κ-Suslin and ë-Borel
[2E.1
are unions of sets, where the index sets I , J are quite arbitrary, suppose that for each
i ∈I , j ∈J there is a set Ci,j which separates Ai from Bj. Then the set
C = S
i∈I
T
j∈J Ci,j
separates A from B.
To prove this, notice that for each i, j, Ai ⊆Ci,j, hence
Ai ⊆T
j∈J Ci,j, hence A = S
i∈I Ai ⊆S
i∈I
T
j∈J Ci,j = C. On the other hand, for
each i, j, Bj ⊆N \ Ci,j, hence B = S
j∈J Bj ⊆S
j∈J(N \ Ci,j) and since this holds
for arbitrary i,
B ⊆T
i∈I
S
j∈J(N \ Ci,j) = T
i∈I (N \ T
j∈J Ci,j)
= N \ S
i∈I
T
j∈J Ci,j = N \ C.
Suppose now that A and B are disjoint κ-Suslin sets of irrationals, so there are trees
T and S on ù × κ and
A = p[T],
B = p[S].
We give two proofs of the result—ﬁrst a simple argument by contradiction and then a
constructive proof which actually exhibits a (κ + 1)-Borel set C that separates A from
B.
Proof by contradiction. Assume that A cannot be separated from B by a (κ+1)-Borel
set. Since
A = p[T] = S
t∈ù,î<κ p[T(t,î)],
B = p[S] = S
s∈ù,ç<κ p[S(s,ç)],
by the remarks above there must be some to, î0, s0, ç0 such that p[T(t0,î0)] and p[S(s0,ç0)]
cannot be separated. This implies that t0 = s0, or else we can take
C = {α : α(0) = t0},
which surely separates these two sets. Hence (t0, î0) ∈T, (t0, ç0) ∈S and p[T(t0,î0)],
p[S(t0,ç0)] cannot be separated by a (κ + 1)-Borel set.
Proceeding recursively, we ﬁnd t0, t1, t2, . . . , î0, î1, î2, . . . , ç0, ç1, ç2, . . . such that for
each n,
u = (t0, î0, . . . , tn−1, în−1) ∈T, v = (t0, ç0, . . . , tn−1, çn−1) ∈S,
and p[Tu], p[Sv] cannot be separated by a (κ + 1)-Borel set. However this is absurd,
since then α = (t0, t1, . . . ) is in both A and B and these sets were assumed disjoint.
Constructive proof. Deﬁne the tree J on ù × κ × κ by
 (t0, î0, ç0), . . . , (tn−1, în−1, çn−1)

∈J
⇐⇒(t0, î0, . . . , tn−1, în−1) ∈T & (t0, ç0, . . . , tn−1, çn−1) ∈S.
We will omit the parentheses in writing the nodes of J as we have been doing for trees
of pairs,
(t0, î0, ç0, . . . , tn−1, în−1, çn−1) =
 (t0, î0, ç0), . . . , (tn−1, în−1, çn−1)

.
Any inﬁnite branch (t0, î0, ç0, t1, î1, ç1, . . . ) in J would determine inﬁnite bran-
ches (t0, î0, t1, î1, . . . ) in T and (t0, ç0, t1, ç1, . . . ) in S with the same irrational part
α = (t0, t1, . . . ), so that α ∈A ∩B contrary to hypothesis. Hence J is a wellfounded
tree.
To simplify notation, assign to each sequence
u = (t0, î0, ç0, . . . , tn−1, în−1, çn−1)

from ù × κ × κ the two sequences that it determines in ù × κ
ô(u) = (t0, î0, . . . , tn−1, în−1),
ó(u) = (t0, ç0, . . . , tn−1, çn−1).
By the usual convention,
ô(∅) = ó(∅) = ∅.
Now
J = {u : ô(u) ∈T and ó(u) ∈S}.
If v is a sequence from ù × κ put
Av = p[Tv],
Bv = p[Sv].
We will deﬁne by bar recursion on the wellfounded tree J a function
u 7→Cu
such that for each sequence u in ù × κ × κ,
(a) Cu is (κ + 1)-Borel,
(b) Cu separates Aô(u) from Bó(u).
This will complete the proof, since Aô(∅) = A∅= A and Bó(∅) = B∅= B, so C = C∅
will be the required set.
We have for each u
Aô(u) = p[Tô(u)] = S
t<ù,î<κ Aô(u)b(t,î),
Bó(u) = p[Só(u)] = S
s<ù,ç<κ Bó(u)b(s,ç);
hence by the remarks at the beginning of this proof, it is enough to deﬁne sets Dt,î,s,ç
such that
(c) Dt,î,s,ç is (κ + 1)-Borel,
(d) Dt,î,s,ç separates Aô(u)b(t,î) from Bó(u)b(s,ç), since then the set
Cu = S
t<ù,î<κ
T
s<ù,ç<κ Dt,î,s,ç
will surely be (κ + 1)-Borel and separate Aô(u) from Bó(u).
If t = s and ub(t, î, ç) ∈J, we can take
Dt,î,s,ç = Cub(t,î,ç),
since by the induction hypothesis of the bar recursion we can assume that Cub(t,î,ç)
has been deﬁned, it is (κ + 1)-Borel and it separates Aô(u)b(t,î) from Bó(u)b(s,ç). Hence
it is enough to deﬁne Dt,î,s,ç when t ̸= s or t = s but ub(t, î, ç) /∈J.
If t ̸= s, take
Dt,î,s,ç = {α : α(n) = t},
where n is the length of the sequence u, so that
α ∈Aô(u)b(t,î) =⇒α(n) = t;
clearly Aô(u)b(t,î) ⊆{α : α(n) = t}, while
Bó(u)b(s,ç) ∩{α : α(n) = t} = ∅.
If t = s but ub(t, î, ç) /∈J, there are two cases.
Case 1. ô(u)b(t, î) /∈T. In this case Aô(u)b(t,î) = ∅and we can take Dt,î,s,ç = ∅.
Case 2. ó(u)b(s, ç) /∈S. In this case Bó(u)b(s,ç) = ∅and we can take Dt,î,s,ç = N.⊣

2. κ-Suslin and ë-Borel
[2E.2
The constructive argument in this proof is somehow more satisfying, since it actually
shows us how to build a separating set C from the trees T and S that determine the
given sets. More than that, there is additional information about C that is implicit in
the proof and which we will extract and utilize later on.
2E.2. The Suslin Theorem. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal. If a pointset A ⊆X and
its complement X \ A are both κ-Suslin, then A is (κ + 1)-Borel.
In particular, a set is Borel if and only if it is ∆

1.(8)
Proof is immediate from 2E.1, taking B = X \ A.
⊣
The theorem of Suslin is the standard construction principle , the result we always try
to imitate or extend to more general situations. It reduces the fairly complex operation
of projection along N to an iteration of complementation and countable union; this,
of course, only in the special circumstance when we know that both the given set A
and its complement can be deﬁned by projecting closed sets. It will become clear as
we go on that projection along N applied to more complicated sets is a very complex
operation. In the general situation, it produces sets much more diﬃcult to understand
than those we apply it to.

Hint. By 1G.5, it is enough to consider the case f : N →Y, with A a closed subset
of N. As before, let
N(k0, . . . , kn−1) = {α : α(0) = k0, . . . , α(n −1) = kn−1}
and put
A(k0, . . . , kn−1) = f[A ∩N(k0, . . . , kn−1)].
Each A(k0, . . . , kn−1) is Σ
e
1
1 and these sets are pairwise disjoint for ﬁxed n since f is
injective on A; hence by 2E.6 there exist Borel sets B(k0, . . . , kn−1), pairwise disjoint
for each ﬁxed n, so that
A(k0, . . . , kn−1) ⊆B(k0, . . . , kn−1).
Let us get a better separating sequence by putting
B∗(k) = B(k) ∩A(k),
B∗(k0, k1) = B(k0, k1) ∩A(k0, k1) ∩B∗(k0),
and in general
B∗(k0, . . . , kn) = B(k0, . . . , kn) ∩A(k0, . . . , kn) ∩B∗(k0, . . . , kn−1).
Easily,
A(k0, . . . , kn−1) ⊆B∗(k0, . . . , kn−1) ⊆A(k0, . . . , kn−1)
and it is not hard to check that
f[A] = AuB∗(u);
this is because if x ∈T
n B∗ α(0), . . . , α(n −1)

Moreover, the system u 7→B∗(u) satisﬁes the conditions of 2B.3, hence AuB∗(u) is
Borel.

injective image of B, via the projection (x, y) 7→y.

Hint. The set A = {(x, y) : f(x, y) = 0} is Borel and the map (x, y) 7→y is an

2F. Inductive analysis of projections of trees
The chief result of this section is that Σ
e
1
1 sets can be expressed as both the union and
the intersection of ℵ1 Borel sets. This will be an easy corollary of a general structure
result about projections of trees.
In 2D we associated a canonical rank function ñ = ñT with every wellfounded tree
T on some X. It is convenient to have a rank function for T even when T is not
wellfounded—we will simply put ñ(u) = ∞if u is not in the wellfounded part of T.
To be precise, if T is a tree on X, the wellfounded part of T is deﬁned by
WF(T) = {u : u /∈T or u ∈T but there is no inﬁnite sequence x0, x1, . . .
such that for every n, ub(x0, . . . , xn−1) ∈T}.
Putting into WF(T) the sequences outside T is of course only a matter of convenience.
Now WF(T) is not a tree, but it is clear that we can deﬁne functions by bar recursion
on WF(T) exactly as we do on all the sequences from X when T is wellfounded. In
that case, of course,
WF(T) = {u : u is a sequence from X}.
Put then
ñ(u) =
(
supremum{ñ
 ub(x)

+ 1 : ub(x) ∈T}
if u ∈WF(T),
∞
if u /∈WF(T),
where ∞is assumed greater than all ordinals in the situations below. If there is need
to identify the tree with which we are working we write
ñ(u) = ñT(u) = ñ(T, u).
It follows exactly as in 2D.1 that if card(X) = κ and T is a tree on X then
u ∈WF(T) =⇒ñ(T, u) < κ+.

P(x) ⇐⇒(∃α)Q(x, α),
and by 2F.2 there are Borel sets Cî such that
Q(x, α) ⇐⇒(∃î < ℵ1)Cî(x, α).
Thus
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃α)(∃î < ℵ1)Cî(x, α)

This is as far as results of this type can go, even if we go to set theories stronger than
Zermelo-Fraenkel. One of the exciting modern results is the theorem of Martin that
with strong hypotheses, Π
e
1
2 (and hence Σ
e
1
3) sets are unions of ℵ2 Borel sets!
Theorems 2F.2 and 2F.3 are trivial if one assumes the continuum hypothesis, that
2ℵ0 = ℵ1, since then every subset of N is the union of ℵ1 singletons (which are Borel
sets) and the intersection of ℵ1 complements of singletons (which are Borel sets). If,
on the other hand we think of 2ℵ0 as very large compared to ℵ1, then 2F.3 can be
considered a construction principle for Σ

compared to Σ

Exercises
Let us ﬁrst use Theorem 2F.2 to get a simple characterization of ℵn-Suslin sets for
n = 1, 2, . . . .
2F.4 (AC). Prove that a pointset P ⊆X is ℵn-Suslin (n ≥1) if and only if
P = S
î<ℵn Pî
where each Pî is Borel (Martin [1971]).
Hint. One way comes directly from the closure properties of κ-Suslin sets. For the
converse suppose ﬁrst P is ℵ1-Suslin; then by 2B.4,
P = S
î<ℵ1 Pî,
where each Pî is ℵ0-Suslin, i.e., Σ
e
1
1; each Pî in turn is the union of ℵ1 Borel sets by 2F.2,
so P is the union of ℵ1 · ℵ1 = ℵ1 Borel sets. The result follows by induction on n.
(Notice the use of the axiom of choice in this proof.)

The next two exercises outline a diﬀerent and interesting proof of the Strong Sepa-
ration Theorem.(11)
Suppose B ⊆N is the complement of some κ-Suslin set A = p[T], where T is a
tree on ù × κ. For each set C ⊆B and each u = (k0, î0, . . . , kn−1, în−1), put
Index(C, T, u) = supremum{ñ

2F.5. In the notation just introduced, prove that if κ+ is regular and C is a κ-Suslin
subset of B, then
Index(C, T) < κ+.
Hint. Assume towards a contradiction that

Now let
α = (n0, n1, . . . )
and notice that α ∈p[S] ∩p[T] = A ∩C, contrary to the hypothesis that C ⊆B.
Note. We assumed that κ+ is regular to avoid appealing to the (full) Axiom of
Choice, which is needed to prove this for every inﬁnite κ. For the classical case with
κ = ℵ0, of course, only the Countable Axiom of Choice is needed to show that ℵ1 is
regular.

2G. The Kunen-Martin Theorem
One can easily prove by classical methods that every Σ
e
1
1 wellfounded relation has
countable length; in particular, there cannot be a Σ
e
1
1 wellordering of the continuum.
We will prove here a much more general recent result due independently to Kunen and
Martin.
One of the consequences of the Kunen-Martin Theorem is that Σ
e
1
2 well founded
relations have length less than ℵ2; in particular, if there is a Σ
e
1
2 wellordering of R,
then the continuum hypothesis holds. This was proved by Martin (before the general
result) in one of the ﬁrst spectacular demonstrations of what modern set theoretic
techniques can do for the classical theory.
We will give Kunen’s proof of the Kunen-Martin theorem since it is very simple and
in the spirit of the methods we have been using in this chapter.
With each binary relation R(x, y) on a set S we associate a strict part <R,
x <R y ⇐⇒R(x, y) & ¬R(y, x).
Of course it may be that <R= R if R is already strict, i.e., if
R(x, y) =⇒¬R(y, x).

2G.1]
2G. The Kunen-Martin Theorem
75
We call R wellfounded if every nonempty subset of S has a <R-minimal element, i.e.,
∅⊊A ⊆S =⇒for some x ∈A and all y ∈A, ¬y <R x.
It is easy to verify that this is equivalent to the condition that there are no <R-inﬁnite
descending chains, i.e., there is no sequence
x0 >R x1 >R x2 >R · · · .
It is common to study wellfounded relations with various additional properties, like
transitivity or reﬂexiveness—see the exercises for a statement of these conditions. Many
results, however, go through without such restrictions and it is convenient to prove
them in this generality. Since only the strict part of a relation comes into the deﬁnition
of wellfoundedness, we often restrict attention to strict, wellfounded relations which
we denote by symbols like <, ≺, etc.
We may justify proof by induction and deﬁnition by recursion on a wellfounded
relation exactly as we did for wellfounded trees in 2D. In particular, each well founded
relation R on S admits a rank function
ñ : S ։ ë = |R|,
where ñ is determined by the recursion
ñ(x) = supremum{ñ(y) + 1 : y <R x}
and |R| = |<R | is the length of R,
|R| = supremum{ñ(y) + 1 : x ∈S}.
Notice that
ñ(x) = 0 ⇐⇒for every y, ¬y <R x.
It will be convenient for the proof of the Kunen-Martin Theorem to introduce the
notion of a good semiscale.
A sequence ϕ = {ϕn}n∈ù of κ-norms on a pointset P is a good κ-semiscale if
whenever x0, x1, . . . are in P and for each ﬁxed n the sequence of ordinals
ϕn(x0), ϕn(x1), ϕn(x2), . . .
is ultimately constant, then there is some x ∈P such that limi→∞xi = x.
2G.1. Lemma. If κ is an inﬁnite cardinal and a pointset P admits a κ-semiscale, then
P admits a good κ-semiscale.
Proof. Let
ð : κ × ù ֌
→κ
be a bijection of κ × ù with κ and for each x, choose q(x, i) such that
x ∈Nq(x,i),
radius(Nq(x,i)) ≤2−i.
Here of course
N0, N1, . . .
is a basis for the open sets in the product space X which contains P.
Given a κ-semiscale ϕ = {ϕn}n∈ù on P, put

If x0, x1, . . . are in P and for each n, øn(xi) is ultimately constant, then clearly for
each n the sequences
q(x0, n), q(x1, n), q(x2, n), . . .
ϕn(x0), ϕn(x1), ϕn(x2), . . .
are ultimately constant. In particular, for each n the sequence x0, x1, . . . is ultimately
trapped in some ﬁxed nbhd Nsn = Nq(xm,n) of radius ≤2−n, so there is a point x to
which x0, x1, x2, . . . converges. Now the fact that ϕ is a κ-semiscale on P implies that
x ∈P, so ø = {øn}n∈ù is a good κ-semiscale on P.
⊣
If u = (x0, . . . , xn−1) and v = (y0, . . . , ym−1) are sequences in some set X, put
u ≻v ⇐⇒u is a proper initial segment of v
⇐⇒n < m and x0 = y0, . . . , xn−1 = yn−1.
2G.2. The Kunen-Martin Theorem. Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal, suppose < is
a strict wellfounded relation on a subset P of some perfect product space X, suppose
further that (as a subset of X × X), < is κ-Suslin. Then the length of < is less than
κ+.(12)
Proof. Consider the tree T on X deﬁned by
T = {(x0, x1, . . . , xn−1) : x0 > x1 > · · · > xn−1}.
Clearly T is well founded. If ñ is the rank function of <, it is easy to check by induction
on x ∈P that
(x0, . . . , xn−1, x) ∈T ⇐⇒ñ(x) = ñ
 T, (x0, . . . , xn−1, x)

,
where ñ(T, u) is the rank of u in T. Hence
| < | = supremum{ñ(x) + 1 : x ∈P}
= supremum{ñ(T, x) + 1 : (x) ∈T}
= ñ(T, ∅),
i.e.,
| < | = |T| = the length of T
and it is enough to prove that |T| < κ+.
The method of proof is to deﬁne a wellfounded tree S on κ and a mapping
ó : T →S

To deﬁne S and ó let ø = {øn}n∈ù be a good κ-semiscale on the set {(x, y) : x > y}.
Here this means that if x0 > y0, x1 > y1, . . . and if for each n the sequence of ordinals

Consider the following conditions on a binary relation ⪯on a set S.
(a) ⪯is transitive, i.e., x ⪯y & y ⪯z =⇒x ⪯z.
(b) ⪯is reﬂexive, i.e., for all x ∈S, x ⪯x.
(c) ⪯is antisymmetric, i.e., x ⪯y & y ⪯x =⇒x = y.
(d) ⪯is connected, i.e., for every x, y ∈S, x ⪯y or y ⪯x.
(e) ⪯is wellfounded.
There are various names attached to relations that satisfy some of these conditions
and we put them down here for the record.
(1) ⪯is a partial ordering if it is transitive, reﬂexive and antisymmetric.
(2) ⪯is a ordering if it is a connected partial ordering.
(3) ⪯is a wellordering if it is a wellfounded ordering.

if ⪯has all the properties of a wellordering except for antisymmetry.

2H. Category and measure
We have proved that not every Σ
e
1
1 set is Borel. There are times, however, when it is
useful to know that a pointset P is approximately equal to some Borel set P∗, in the
sense that the symmetric diﬀerence
P △P∗= (P \ P∗) ∪(P∗\ P)
is small. We establish here a general, set theoretic result about approximations of
κ-Suslin sets by (κ+1)-Borel sets modulo a given κ-ideal. This will imply, in particular,
that Σ
e
1
1 sets are Lebesgue measurable and have the property of Baire.
Fix a perfect product space X. A collection J of subsets of X is a κ-ideal (κ an
inﬁnite cardinal) if J is closed under subsets and unions of length κ, i.e.,
A ⊆B & B ∈J =⇒A ∈J,
for each î < κ, Aî ∈J =⇒S
î<κ Aî ∈J.
If κ = ℵ0, instead of ℵ0-ideals we talk of ó-ideals.
Suppose C is a ﬁxed ë-algebra of subsets of X. We say that P ⊆X is in C modulo
J if there is some P∗in C such that P △P∗∈J. In particular, P is (κ + 1)-Borel
modulo J if P △P∗∈J for some (κ + 1)-Borel P∗.
Recall that a pointset A is meager if A = S
n An with each An nowhere dense, i.e.,
such that the closure An contains no open set. The collection M of all meager subsets
of X is obviously a ó-ideal.
Suppose ì is a ó-ﬁnite Borel measure on X, i.e., a countably additive function on
the Borel subsets of X with values real numbers ≥0 or ∞and such that we can write
X = Sù
n An
with An ∈B, ì(An) < ∞for each n. Let Zì be the collection of null sets or sets of
measure 0 (in the completed measure), i.e.,
A ∈Zì ⇐⇒there exists a Borel set B such that A ⊆B and ì(B) = 0.
Again it is clear that Zì is a ó-ideal.
These are the two standard examples which we want covered by the approximation
theorem. They satisfy an additional hypothesis which will be crucial to the proof.
Suppose again J is a κ-ideal on X and C is a (κ + 1)-algebra of subsets of X. We
say that J is regular from above relative to C if for every P ⊆X there is some ˜P ∈C
such that (see Figure 2H.1)

regular from above relative to the Borel sets.
2H.1. The Approximation Theorem (AC for κ > ℵ0). Let κ be an inﬁnite cardinal,
suppose J is a κ-ideal on some perfect product space X, assume that J is regular from
above relative to some (κ + 1)-algebra of sets C. Then the collection of sets which are in
C modulo J is closed under complementation, unions of length κ and the operation A κ.
In particular, every κ-Suslin subset of X is (κ +1)-Borel modulo J, taking C = Bκ+1 ↾
X.(13)
Proof. If Pî △P∗
î ∈J for all î < κ, then
(S
î<κ Pî) △(S
î<κ P∗
î ) ⊆S
î<κ(Pî △P∗
î ) ∈J.
Similarly, if P △P∗∈J, then (X \ P) △(X \ P∗) = P △P∗∈J. Thus the collection
of subsets of X which are in C modulo J is closed under complementation and unions
of length κ.

an open ball B1 so that B1 ⊆B \ A1 and radius(B1) < 1, choose an open ball B2 so
that B2 ⊆B1 \ A2 and radius(B2) < 1

A pointset P has the property of Baire if there is some open set P∗such that P △P∗

Hint. Open sets clearly have the property of Baire.
If P is closed, let P∗=
Interior(P) = {x ∈P : for some nbhd N of x, N ⊆P}. Show that P \ P∗is nowhere
dense, so P △P∗is meager. Notice that (P′ △Q) = (P △Q′), where ′ denotes the

Hint. Let

Show that D(P) is closed and that P \ D(P) is meager, so P \ D(P) ⊆W for some

2H.6 (AC). Prove that there are sets of real numbers which do not have the property
of Baire.
Hint. This needs the axiom of choice. One way to do it is by a construction similar
to that of 2C.4.
First argue that there are exactly 2ℵ0 pairs (G, F ), where G is open and F is a meager
Fó. Wellorder R = {xî : î < 2ℵ0} and the set of these pairs, {(Gî, Fî) : î < 2ℵ0}.
You want to construct a set A such that the inclusion
A △Gî = (A \ Gî) ∪(Gî \ A) ⊆Fî
fails for every î. Deﬁne by recursion bijections
fî : î ֌
→Aî and gî : î ֌
→Bî
such that
î < ç =⇒fî ⊆fç, gî ⊆gç
and (Aî \ Gî) ∪(Gî ∩Bî) ⊆Fî fails.
At the î’th step, either R \ (Gî \ Fî) is
uncountable, hence of cardinality 2ℵ0 and we can throw in Aî some element of this
set; or R = Gî ∪F ′
î where F ′
î is meager, Fó and F ′
î ⊇Fî, hence Gî \ F ′
î is uncountable
and has cardinality 2ℵ0 and we can throw in Bî an element of this set.

x = inﬁmum{ì(Q) : Q Borel, P ⊆Q}.
Choose a decreasing sequence Q1 ⊇Q2 ⊇· · · of Borel sets, Qn ⊇P, such that

A set P ⊆X is measurable relative to a ó-ﬁnite Borel measure ì on X if there are
Borel sets ˜P and Q such that P △˜P ⊆Q and ì(Q) = 0. We let ì(P) = ì( ˜P) for any
˜P with this property—ì( ˜P) is obviously independent of the choice of ˜P.
A set P ⊆X is absolutely measurable if it is measurable relative to every ó-ﬁnite
Borel measure ì on X.
2H.8. Prove that the collection of sets measurable relative to a ó-ﬁnite Borel measure
ì of X contains all Σ

1 sets and is closed under complementation, countable
unions and the operation A , and so the collection of absolutely measurable subsets of
X has the same properties.(13)
Recall that if A is a set of reals, then the Lebesgue outer measure of A is deﬁned by
ë∗(A) = inﬁmum
n ∞
X
i=0
(bi −ai) : A ⊆S∞
i (ai, bi)

,
where of course (ai, bi) is the open interval from ai to bi.
We call A Lebesgue
measurable if for every closed interval [a, b]
ë∗(A ∩[a, b]) + ë∗([a, b] \ A) = b −a.

2. κ-Suslin and ë-Borel
[2H.9
It is a standard result of real analysis that the collection of Lebesgue measurable sets
contains all open sets and is closed under both complementation and countable union;
in particular every Borel set is Lebesgue measurable. Moreover, ì∗is a measure on the
class of Lebesgue measurable sets, the Lebesgue measure. In particular, the restriction
ë = ë∗↾B(R)
of ë∗to the Borel sets is a (ó-ﬁnite) Borel measure on R. The deﬁnition of measurability
we gave above for arbitrary ó-ﬁnite Borel measures is consistent with this deﬁnition
of Lebesgue measurability, cf. 2H.11.
2H.9 (AC). Prove that there is a set of reals A contained in the unit interval [0, 1]
such that ì∗(A) = ì∗([0, 1] \ A) = 1. In particular, A is not Lebesgue measurable.
Hint. This is one more construction by transﬁnite recursion and choice. First argue
that there are 2ℵ0 open coverings G = {(ai, bi) : i ∈ù} with P∞
i=0(bi −ai) < 1 and
wellorder them {Gî : î < 2ℵ0}. Now build Aî, Bî so that Aî∩Bî = ∅, card(Aî) < 2ℵ0,
card(Bî) < 2ℵ0 and each [0, 1] \ Gî intersects both Aî and Bî as in 2C.4. The key
observation is that each [0, 1] \ Gî has cardinality 2ℵ0.
⊣
We will see later that these results about category and measure are best possible
in the context of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. One cannot prove in this theory that
∆
e
1
2 sets of reals have the property of Baire or are Lebesgue measurable. There are,
however, natural strong axioms of set theory which imply that all Σ
e
1
2 sets have these
regularity properties and still stronger axioms which allow us to to establish that all
projective sets are Lebesgue measurable and have the property of Baire.
By the basic deﬁnition of Λ-measurability is Section 1G, we call f : X →Y
Baire measurable if for every basic nbhd Ns ⊆Y, f−1[Ns] has the property of Baire.
Similarly, if ì is a ó-ﬁnite Borel measure on X, then f : X →Y is ì-measurable
if each f−1[Ns] is measurable relative to ì. We say that f : X →Y is absolutely
measurable if f is ì-measurable relative to every ó-ﬁnite Borel measure ì on X.
These functions come up often in the applications of descriptive set theory to
analysis. Here we will conﬁne ourselves to a simple but useful remark about them.
2H.10. Prove that if f : X →Y is Baire-measurable, then there exists a Gä set
P ⊆X which is comeager (i.e., X \ P is meager) and such that the restriction f ↾P of
f to P is continuous.
Similarly, if f : X →Y is ì-measurable relative to a ó-ﬁnite Borel measure ì, then
there exists an Fó set P ⊆X and a Borel function f∗: X →Y, such that X \ P has
measure 0 and
x ∈P =⇒f(x) = f∗(x).
Hint. For each basic nbhd Ns ⊆Y, choose an open set Gó in X such that
f−1[Ns] △Gó is meager, choose a meager Fó-set Qs in X such that f−1[Ns] △Gó ⊆
Qs and take Q = S

then ë(B) = 0.

2I. Historical remarks
85
A function f : R →Y is Lebesgue measurable if for every basic nbhd Ns ⊆Y, the
inverse image f−1[Ns] is Lebesgue measurable. The next problem is an immediate
consequence of 2H.10 and 2H.11,
2H.12. Prove that f : R →Y is Lebesgue measurable if and only if there is a Borel
function f∗: R →Y which is almost everywhere equal to f, i.e., the set
{x ∈R : f(x) ̸= f∗(x)}
has Lebesgue measure 0.
2I. Historical remarks
1As we have already noted, the operation A = A ℵ0 was introduced in the basic
paper Suslin [1917], although some similar ideas can be found in Alexandroﬀ[1916]
and Hausdorﬀ[1916]. Suslin [1917] and Lusin [1917] also contain, at least implicitly,
the characterization of Σ
e
1
1 sets of reals as projections of closed sets in R × N.
2The more general operation A κ for any cardinal κ was introduced by Maximoﬀ
[1940], who also deﬁned what we have called here ë-Borel sets. Maximoﬀworked
in large, non-separable spaces and deﬁned “κ-Suslin” to be the sets obtained via the
operation A κ applied to Suslin systems u 7→Pu, where each Pu is (κ + 1)-Borel; this
is a much larger class of sets than our κ-Suslin sets. Stone [1962] studies the present
notion of κ-Suslin, but he relates these to the usual Borel (ℵ1-Borel) sets, again in
non-separable spaces.
3Our own approach here has been to use these general notions of κ-Suslin and
ë-Borel sets as tools for obtaining speciﬁc information about projective pointsets.
There is some anticipation of this in Sierpinski [1927], where he shows that his “hyper-
borelian” sets of reals must have cardinality ≤ℵ1 or 2ℵ0; these turn out to be precisely
the ℵ1-Suslin sets, although Sierpinski deﬁned them diﬀerently. The modern approach
is due to Mansﬁeld [1970] who used trees and especially Martin [1971] who saw most
clearly its potentialities.
4Semiscales are quite modern and come from the scales introduced in Moschovakis
[1971a] to study uniformization problems. We will look at these closely in Chapter 4.
5In Chapters 6, 7 and 8 it will become obvious why we developed here the theory
of κ-Suslin sets rather than concentrate on the classical Σ
e
1
1 sets. The proofs for the
special case are no simpler than the ones we gave. A hint for the kind of applications
in the sequel shows in 2D.3, the fact that Σ
e
1
2 pointsets are ℵ1-Suslin. This important
result is implicit in Shoenﬁeld [1961].
6The closure of the projective classes Σ
e
1
n, Π
e
1
n, ∆
e
1
n under the operation A (2B.4) was
established by Kantorovitch and Livenson [1932] and later, (by the simple proof we
gave) by Addison and Kleene [1957].
7The Perfect Set Theorem 2C.2 is due to Mansﬁeld [1970] in its full generality, but of
course there were several similar earlier results. The speciﬁc application to Σ
e
1
1 sets is
due to Suslin—it was announced in Lusin [1917]. The proof we gave is due to Solovay.
8Suslin [1917] announced the Suslin Theorem (2E.2, for κ = ℵ0 of course) but gave
no hint of its proof. The ﬁrst published proof is in Lusin and Sierpinski [1918]—
this is the argument outlined in 2F.4 and 2F.5. Another proof was given in Lusin and
Sierpinski [1923]. Lusin [1927] established the more general Separation Theorem 2E.1,
but the proofs in the preceding two papers could certainly have been used for this too.

86
2. κ-Suslin and ë-Borel
[2I
Lusin [1930b] gives both the argument by contradiction and a constructive proof, as
we did.
9Among the immediate corollaries of the Suslin Theorem, perhaps the most signif-
icant are 2E.5, 2E.8, 2E.9, 2E.10 and 2E.11. The characterization of Borel sets as
the continuous, injective images of closed subsets of N is already stated (in somewhat
diﬀerent form) in Lusin [1917]; Lusin says that it can be proved “using a method of
Suslin,” so it is quite likely a joint result. The same is probably true of 2E.5, 2E.9,
2E.10 and 2E.11 which were considered particularly important, since they showed
that the claims of Lebesgue [1905] about implicitly deﬁned functions were correct,
even though Lebesgue’s proof was wrong. These results were all treated in detail in
Lusin [1927].
10Lusin and Sierpinski [1918] established that Π
e
1
1 sets are unions of ℵ1 Borel sets
and Lusin and Sierpinski [1923] proved the same representation for Σ
e
1
1 sets. This
representation for Σ
e
1
2 sets (2F.3) is due to Sierpinski [1925] who also established the
elegant equations of 2F.1 in his [1926].
11The exercises of 2F are directly from Lusin and Sierpinski [1918]. There are many
applications of the so-called Lusin-Sierpinski index which we will study in Chapter 4,
in a general setting.
12Logicians interested in descriptive set theory often refer to “the classical result”
that Σ
e
1
1 wellfounded relations have countable length. This was apparently never put
down on paper, but it is certainly easy to show by classical methods. Martin showed
in 1968 that Σ
e
1
2 wellfounded relations have length below ℵ2 (2G.4) by a sophisticated
argument, using forcing. The more general and simple Kunen-Martin Theorem 2G.2
was proved independently in 1971 by its two authors and was not published until
Martin [1971].
13According to Kuratowski [1966], the Approximation Theorem 2H.1 is due to
Szpilrajn-Marczewski who published it in Polish in 1929.
The speciﬁc corollaries
were established earlier as follows: Σ
e
1
1 sets have the property of Baire (Lusin and
Sierpinski [1923]); the collection of sets with the property of Baire is closed under the
operation A (Nikodym [1925]); Σ
e
1
1 sets are Lebesgue measurable (Lusin [1917]); the
collection of Lebesgue measurable sets is closed under the operation A (Lusin and
Sierpinski [1918]).
14The fact that the collection of ì-measurable sets is closed under the operation
A (2H.8) has been extended by Choquet [1955] from measures to capacities, roughly
“subadditive measures”.
A very simple and elegant exposition of this important
theorem can be found in Carleson [1967].

CHAPTER 3
BASIC NOTIONS OF THE EFFECTIVE THEORY
Our choice of basic notions in Chapter 1 was based on the implicit assumption that
open sets are somehow “simple.” They are just given at the very start, and then we
build more complicated sets from them. Let us try here to analyze this view.
Suppose G is an open set of reals, say
G = S
n(an, bn),
where each (an, bn) is an open interval with rational endpoints. Given a real number
x, we may attempt to ﬁnd out if x ∈G by searching for some n such that an < x < bn.
One natural way to be “given” x is via a sequence of rationals converging to it with a
known modulus of convergence, say
x = limi→∞qi,
where for each i,
|x −qi| ≤2−i.
We now search for some n and i such that
an + 2−i < qi < bn −2−i;
(∗)
if and when we ﬁnd them, we will know that x ∈G.
We have described a semieﬀective membership test for G which will verify that x ∈G
if this is true. If x /∈G, this procedure will not terminate—we will simply not be able
to ﬁnd n and i such that (∗) holds.
It seems improbable that we can discover a genuine eﬀective membership test which
will decide by a ﬁnite computation whether an arbitrary given x is or is not a member
of G. In fact, even if G = (0, 1) and it just so happens that x = 1, we will never be
able to assert with certainty that x /∈G by looking at the approximations qi.
This argument suggests that open sets are “simple” because they are “semieﬀective.”
One factor we did not consider is the complexity of the function
n 7→(an, bn).
Suppose, for example, that (p0, q0), (p1, q1), . . . is an eﬀective enumeration of all open
intervals with rational endpoints and put
(an, bn) =
(
(pn, qn)
if f(n, x1, . . . , xk) ̸= 0 for all integers x1, . . . , xk,
(0, 1)
otherwise.
Suppose further that f(n, x1, . . . , xk) = 0 is a hopelessly complicated Diophantine
equation which cannot (apparently) be solved by any of the standard methods. To
verify that an < x < bn, we must ﬁrst ﬁnd out if f(n, x1, . . . , xk) = 0 has solutions,
or else we do not even know whether (an, bn) = (pn, qn) or (an, bn) = (0, 1). Here
87

88
3. Basic notions of the eﬀective theory
[3
the “semieﬀective” membership test for G = S
n(an, bn) breaks down at the very
beginning—we do not know for what intervals (a, b) we should attempt to verify that
a < x < b.
Of course this is a perverse example. The open sets that occur naturally in mathemat-
ical practice are almost always of the form S
n(an, bn) where the function n 7→(an, bn)
can be computed by some explicit or recursive procedure.
An open set G is semirecursive if G = S
n(an, bn), where the function n 7→(an, bn)
is computable. To make this precise, we will appeal to the Church-Turing Thesis, one
of the central discoveries of modern mathematical logic. This identiﬁes the intuitive
notion of a computable function on the integers with the precise, mathematical concept
of a recursive function.
The semirecursive pointsets are just the eﬀectively described open sets, those open
sets for which the procedure described above can in fact be carried out. They include
almost all open sets one is likely to encounter in analysis or topology. Starting with
them, we will deﬁne eﬀective Borel and Lusin pointclasses and develop an interesting
and non-trivial reﬁnement of the theory in Chapter 1.
Using semirecursive pointsets one can also introduce in a natural way, recursive
functions
f : X →Y
on product spaces. Intuitively, f is recursive if we have an algorithm which given
(suﬃciently close approximations to) x produces (arbitrarily accurate approximations
to) f(x). Every recursive function is continuous, but not vice versa. Again, every
special continuous function that one is likely to meet in ordinary mathematical practice
is in fact recursive.
It is obvious from these remarks that we will study recursion theory as an eﬀective
version, a reﬁnement of pointset topology.
One of the most fascinating aspects of this approach is that it leads naturally to
an eﬀective descriptive set theory on the space ù. Contrary to our promise in the
introduction to Chapter 1, we have said nothing about deﬁnable sets of integers. Every
subset of ù is open, so the Borel and Lusin pointclasses trivialize on this space. On
the other hand, there are only countably many semirecursive pointsets and recursive
functions. It turns out that the eﬀective Borel and Lusin pointclasses yield interesting
and non-trivial hierarchies of subsets of ù.
As a matter of fact, the theory for ù was developed by Kleene in the period 1940–
1955 (roughly) entirely independently of classical descriptive set theory. Similarities
and analogies between the two theories were then noticed, particularly by Addison
who initiated the development of the uniﬁed treatment we are presenting here.
It should be emphasized that the eﬀective theory is not only interesting in its own
right—it is also a powerful tool for studying the classical Borel and Lusin pointclasses.
Some of the most important recent results about projective sets depend essentially on
the use of recursion theoretic concepts and techniques.
The development in this chapter is brief but totally self-contained, i.e., it presupposes
no knowledge of logic or recursion theory. Consequently, the reader who is well versed
in these subjects should skip much ofit, particularly Sections 3A and 3F which establish
some of the standard results about recursion on ù. On the other hand, the reader with
no experience in recursion theory should go carefully over 3A and do all the exercises.
These give a stock of recursive functions which we then use constantly and without
apologies or special reference.

3A]
3A. Recursive functions on the integers
89
3A. Recursive functions on the integers(1)
Consider the following “constructive” schemes for deﬁning a function f with integer
arguments from given functions.
Composition. Given g1(x), g2(x), . . . , gm(x) and h(n1, . . . , nm), deﬁne f by
f(x) = h
 g1(x), g2(x), . . . , gm(x)

.
Here and in the equations below x varies over ùk,
x = (x1, . . . , xk) ∈ùk
and all functions take integers as values.
Primitive recursion. Given g(x) and h(u, n, x), deﬁne f(n, x) by the recursion
(
f(0, x) = g(x),
f(n + 1, x) = h
 f(n, x), n, x

.
It is clear that f is determined by these two equations if g and h are given. One
example of primitive recursion is the usual deﬁnition of the addition function,
(
f(0, m) = m,
f(n + 1, m) = f(n, m) + 1.
One proves easily by induction on n that for all m,
f(n, m) = n + m.
The deﬁnition can be brought to the standard form of primitive recursion that we
listed above if we take
g(m) = m
h(u, n, m) = u + 1.
Another example is the usual deﬁnition of multiplication from addition,
(
f(0, m) = 0,
f(n + 1, m) = f(n, m) + m.
Again it is obvious that
f(n, m) = n · m
and we can put this recursion into the form above by choosing
g(m) = 0
h(u, n, m) = u + m.
There is a simpler kind of primitive recursion appropriate for deﬁning functions of
one variable,
(
f(0) = w0,
f(n + 1) = h
 f(n), n

.
For example the predecessor function
pd(n) =
(
n −1
if n > 0,
0,
if n = 0

90
3. Basic notions of the eﬀective theory
[3A
can be deﬁned this way,
(
pd(0) = 0,
pd(n + 1) = n.
We will include this simple scheme when we talk of deﬁnition by primitive recursion.
Minimalization. Suppose g(n, x) is such that
for every x there is some n such that g(n, x) = 0.
Put
f(x) = ìn[g(n, x) = 0]
= the least number n such that g(n, x) = 0.
We called these schemes constructive because they give us a direct way of computing
the values of the new function f in terms of the values of the given functions. For
example, if f is deﬁned from g and h by primitive recursion, to compute f(2, x) we
successively compute
f(0, x) = g(x) = w0,
f(1, x) = h(w0, 0, x) = w1,
f(2, x) = h(w1, 1, x) = w2.
Similarly, if f is deﬁned from g by minimalization, to compute f(x) we successively
compute
g(0, x), g(1, x), g(2, x), . . .
until we ﬁnd some w such that g(w, x) = 0; we set
f(x) = w
for the ﬁrst such w.
The intention is to call a number theoretic function recursive (or computable) if we
can deﬁne it by successive applications of these three simple schemes. Of course we
must have some simple functions to start with, and for these we choose the following
completely trivial functions.
S(n) = n + 1
successor
C k
w(x1, . . . , xk) = w
constant w, as a function of k arguments
Pk
i (x1, . . . , xk) = xi
projection in the i’th component, 1 ≤i ≤k.
Of these, the projection P1
1 would be better named the identity function, P1
1(n) = n.
Now, a function is recursive if it can be deﬁned by successive applications of com-
position, primitive recursion and minimalization starting with the functions S, C k
w,
Pk
i . More precisely, the class of recursive functions is the smallest collection of number
theoretic functions which contains the successor S, all constants C k
w and projections Pk
i
and which is closed under composition, primitive recursion and minimalization.
For example, to prove that addition
f(n, m) = n + m
is recursive, it is enough to show that g and h are recursive, where
g(m) = m
h(u, n, m) = u + 1,

3A]
3A. Recursive functions on the integers
91
by the argument above. But g = P1
1 and
h(u, n, m) = S
 P3
1(u, n, m)

,
so h is recursive as the composition of recursive functions.
Similarly, to show that multiplication
f(n, m) = n · m
is recursive, it is enough to show that g, h are recursive, where
g(m) = 0
h(u, n, m) = u + m.
Again, g = C 1
0 and
h(u, n, m) = P3
1(u, n, m) + P3
3(u, n, m),
so h is recursive as the composition of +, P3
1 and P3
3.
The Church-Turing Thesis is the metamathematical claim that every number the-
oretic function which is intuitively computable is in fact recursive. By “intuitively
computable” we mean that there is an eﬀective, uniform method for computing f(x)
once we are given x.
To justify the Thesis, one must make a deep and detailed study of the class of
recursive functions as well as a careful analysis of the notion of “eﬀective method” or
“algorithm”. Books on recursion theory take great pains to do this carefully. We will
not do it here, as it would take us far aﬁeld from our central interest in the study of
pointsets.
From the strictly technical point of view, the Church-Turing Thesis is irrelevant—
one always works with the precise concept of recursiveness rather than the vague
notion of intuitive computability. After all, no one takes great pains in the classical
theory to justify starting with the open sets—it is taken for granted that these are the
simplest sets we can think of. The Church-Turing Thesis becomes important when we
attempt to draw foundational or philosophical inferences from technical results—and
in those instances one should explicitly bring it in as a consideration.
We will need to know that a great many functions are recursive. This is the point of
the lengthy list of exercises in this section. One should look at these problems much as
one looks at the basic limit theorems in Calculus—the limit of a sum is the sum of the
limits, etc. They are mostly used to prove that various functions are continuous. After
a while, one gets a certain intuitive understanding of continuity and seldom bothers to
give a detailed ε-ä argument. Here too, after these exercises, we will often assert that
“obviously f is recursive” without a proof. The implication is that the recursiveness
of f can be established routinely by the methods of this section.
A k-ary relation on ù, P ⊆ùk, is recursive if its characteristic function ÷P is
recursive, where
÷P(x) =
(
1,
if P(x),
0,
if ¬P(x).
Intuitively, P is recursive if we have an eﬀective way of deciding for each x whether
P(x) of ¬P(x) holds—we simply compute ÷P(x). Recursive relations are also a good
tool to use in proving that various functions are recursive.

by
f(x, y) = g(x),

Closure under the propositional operations is also easy, e.g., if P(x), Q(x) are given

The relation

3B. Recursive presentations
Suppose M is a Polish space with distance function d. A recursive presentation of
M is any sequence
{r0, r1, . . . }
of points in M satisfying the following two conditions.
(1) The set {r0, r1, . . . } is dense in M.

P(i, j, m, k) ⇐⇒d(ri, rj) ≤
m
k + 1,
Q(i, j, m, k) ⇐⇒d(ri, rj) <
m
k + 1,
are recursive.
Not every Polish space admits a recursive presentation—but every interesting space
certainly does. Consider ﬁrst the basic examples ù, R, N, C.
In the case of ù we have the trivial distance function
d(i, j) =
(
0,
if i = j,
1,
if i ̸= j.
Take ri = i so that
d(i, j) ≤
m
k + 1 ⇐⇒[i = j ∨k + 1 ≤m],
d(i, j) <
m
k + 1 ⇐⇒[i = j ∨k + 1 < m].
For the real numbers, choose any eﬀective enumeration of the rationals, where
repetitions are allowed, e.g.,
ri = (−1)(i)0 ·
(i)1
(i)2 + 1.
Proof that this is a recursive presentation is routine by the methods of 3A.
For Baire space, recall that
d(α, â) =



0,
if α = â,
1
ìn[α(n) ̸= â(n)] + 1
if α ̸= â.
Here we need an eﬀective enumeration of all ultimately zero sequences of integers,
e.g.,
ri(n) = (i)n.
Again, the fact that this is a recursive presentation is easy.
Similarly, for the Cantor set C we take all ultimately zero binary sequences,
ri(n) = sg
 (i)n

.
(For the deﬁnition of sg see (∗5) of 3A.2.)
Recall that in Section 1B we ﬁxed once and for all a collection F of basic spaces
including ù, R, N and C. We now assume further that we are given a ﬁxed recursive
presentation
{rM
0 , rM
1 , . . . }
for each basic space M. For ù, R, N and C we take the presentations given above.
Suppose X = X1 × · · · × Xk and we are given metrics d1, . . . , dk and recursive
presentations {r1
0, r1
1, . . . }, {r2
0, r2
1, . . . }, . . . of the spaces X1, . . . , Xk. It is well-known
that the function
d
 (x1, . . . , xk), (x′
1, . . . , x′
k)

= maximum{d1(x1, x′
1), . . . , dk(xk, x′
k)}
is a metric on X which generates the natural product topology. For each i ∈ù, put
ri = (r1
(i)1, . . . , rk
(i)k);

98
3. Basic notions of the eﬀective theory
[3B
we leave it for 3B.3 that {r0, r1, . . . } is a recursive presentation of X with this metric.
We now have a ﬁxed recursive presentation for each product space. If X is a basic
space, x0 ∈X and p is any rational number ≥0, let B(x0, p) be the open ball with
center x0 and radius p,
B(x0, p) = {x ∈X : d(x, x0) < p}.
Taking {r0, r1, . . . } to be the ﬁxed recursive presentation of X, put for each s ∈ù
Bs = B(X, s) = B

r(s)0,
(s)1
(s)2 + 1

.
Clearly B0, B1, . . . is an eﬀective enumeration of a basis for the topology of X. Notice
that the empty set occurs in this enumeration. In fact, Bs = ∅whenever (s)1 = 0, in
particular
B0 = ∅.
For product spaces it is easier to work directly with the natural nbhd basis for the
product topology. For each X = X1 × · · · × Xk and each s ∈ù, put
Ns = N(X, s) = B
 X1, (s)1

× B
 X2, (s)2

× · · · × B
 Xk, (s)k

= {(x1, . . . , xk) : x1 ∈B(s)1 & · · · & xk ∈B(s)k}.
Now N0, N1, . . . is an eﬀective enumeration of a nbhd basis for the topology of X.
Notice again,
N0 = ∅.
In several constructions in the ﬁrst two chapters we used some enumeration of a
nbhd basis for the topology of a product space.
We now ﬁx once and for all the
canonical basis of nbhds
N(X, 0), N(X, 1), . . .
associated with the ﬁxed recursive presentation of X.
Sometimes we need a center and a radius for the basic nbhds, as we described and
used these in Section 1A. We naturally put
center(Ns) = ri = (r1
(i)1, . . . , rk
(i)k),
where
(i)1 =
 (s)1

0, . . . , (i)k =

radius(Ns) = maximum{p1, . . . , pk},

There is one slight annoying technical detail we should clear up here. We have
identiﬁed each basic space X with the “product space” X = X whose only factor is
X. Now we have described two bases for the topology of X, the sequence
B(X, 0), B(X, 1), . . .
of open balls, thinking of X as basic, an the sequence
N(X, 0), N(X, 1), . . .
of “products of one factor,”
N(X, s) = B(X, (s)1).

3B.2]
3B. Recursive presentations
99
Of course the bases are identical, but the enumeration is diﬀerent as the last displayed
equation plainly shows. Notice also that
B(X, s) = N(X, ⟨0, s⟩).
We need two simple lemmas to deal eﬀectively with these codings.
3B.1. Lemma. For any two product spaces X, Y, there are recursive functions f, g, h
such that
N(X, s) × N(Y, t) = N

,
N(X × Y, s) = N
 X, g(s)

from this follows immediately that we can take
f(s, t) = ⟨0, (s)1, . . . , (s)k, (t)1, . . . , (t)l⟩,
g(s) = ⟨0, (s)1, . . . , (s)k⟩,
h(s) = ⟨0, (s)k+1, . . . , (s)k+l⟩.
⊣
The second one is a bit messier.

N(X, s) ∩N(X, t) = S
n N
 X, f(s, t, n)

Similarly, there is a recursive function g, such that
T
i≤m N
 X, (u)i

= S
n N
 X, g(u, m, n)

.
Proof. We show the second assertion ﬁrst.
Let X be a basic space with the recursive presentation {r0, r1, . . . } and suppose
B(x0, p0), . . . , B(xm, pm) are m + 1 open balls in X. Then
x ∈B(x0, p0) ∩· · · ∩B(xm, pm) ⇐⇒(∃i)(∃k)
n
d(ri, x) <

& d(x0, ri) < p0 −
(k)1
(k)2 + 1 & · · · & d(xm, ri) < pm −
(k)1
(k)2 + 1

;
the implication from right to left is trivial, while if the left-hand side holds, then
A =

d(z, x) <

& d(x0, z) < p0 −
(k)1
(k)2 + 1 & · · · & d(xm, z) < pm −
(k)1
(k)2 + 1
io
is open and non-empty (since x ∈A), so A must contain some ri.
Using this
equivalence and the deﬁnition of a recursive presentation, it is easy to see that there is
a recursive relation P(s, m, n) such that
x ∈B(X, s0) ∩· · · ∩B(X, sm) ⇐⇒(∃n)[x ∈B(X, n) & P(⟨s0, . . . , sm⟩, m, n)],
i.e.,
T

n{B(X, n) : P(⟨s0, . . . , sm⟩, m, n)}.

with some recursive irrational ε, i.e., with an irrational ε such that the function
n 7→ε(n)
is recursive. Intuitively, G is semirecursive if it can be written as a recursive union of
basic nbhds.
The deﬁnition suggests that the pointclass of semirecursive sets depends on the
particular coding of basic nbhds by integers which we ﬁxed. We will see in the exercises
that this is not so. It is obvious, however, that the notion of semirecursion depends on
the particular recursive presentations of the basic spaces which we adopted.
It is natural to consider the family of all semirecursive subsets of X as a recursive
topology on X.
It is not closed under arbitrary unions, but it has strong closure
properties, as we now proceed to show.

3. Basic notions of the eﬀective theory
[3C.1
If X = X1 × · · · × Xk, let
ði : X →Xi
be the projection function,
ði(x1, . . . , xk) = xi.
A function
f : X →Y = Y1 × · · · × Yl
is trivial if there are projection functions
f1 : X →Y1, . . . , fl : X →Yl
such that
f(x) =
 f1(x), . . . , fl(x)

.
For example, the map
(x1, x2, x3, x4) 7→(x2, x1, x1)
of X1 × X2 × X3 × X4 into X2 × X1 × X1 is trivial.
3C.1. Theorem. The pointclass of semirecursive sets contains the empty set, every
product space X, every recursive relation on ùk, every basic nbhd N(X, s) and the basic
nbhd relation
{(x, s) : x ∈N(X, s)}
for each X; moreover, it is closed under substitution of trivial functions, & , ∨, ∃≤,
∀≤and ∃ù.
Proof. Notice ﬁrst that if
P = S

This will help a little in the computations below.
Clearly
∅= S
n N(X, 0),
X = S
n N(X, n),
so both ∅and X are semirecursive.
By the deﬁnition of the coding of nbhds in ù,
B(ù, ⟨i, 1, 1⟩) =
n
m : d(m, i) <

1 + 1
o
= {i},
hence each singleton is a basic nbhd in ùk:

so P is semirecursive by the closure properties we have established already.
⊣
The proof of 3C.1 was messy, because we were forced to deal directly with the coding
of nbhds. In the sequel, we will be able to give fairly simple proofs of semirecursiveness
by applying 3C.1 and the remaining results of this section.
It is worth emphasizing the usefulness of closure under trivial substitutions, which
allows us to identify, permute or introduce new arguments in relations. For example,
suppose
P(x, y, x) ⇐⇒(∃n){Q(x, n) & R(n, y, z)}
with Q, R semirecursive; then
P(x, y, z) ⇐⇒(∃n){Q∗(x, y, z, n) & R∗(x, y, z, n)}
with
Q∗(x, y, z, n) ⇐⇒Q(x, n),
R∗(x, y, z, n) ⇐⇒R(n, y, z)
and since both Q∗and R∗are semirecursive by closure under trivial substitutions, so
is P by closure under & and ∃ù. In Section 1C we were appealing to closure of the
ﬁnite Borel classes under continuous substitution to do this kind of computation.
We will see in 3D.2 that the pointclass of semirecursive sets is closed under substi-
tution of recursive functions on product spaces, which include the trivial functions.
Let us call a product space X of type 0 if X = ùk for some k. These are the discrete
product spaces. A pointset P is of type 0 if P ⊆ùk for some k.
3C.2. Theorem. A pointset P ⊆ùk of type 0 is semirecursive if and only if there is a
recursive relation R ⊆ùk+1 such that
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃n)R(x, n).
Moreover, P is recursive if and only if both P and ¬P = ùk \ P are semirecursive.

3. Basic notions of the eﬀective theory
[3C.3
Proof. Assume ﬁrst that P ⊆ùk is semirecursive,
P = S

 ùk, ε(n)

,
with ε recursive. Then
P(x1, . . . , xk) ⇐⇒(∃n)(∃m)[ε(n) = m & (x1, . . . , xk) ∈N(ùk, m)]
so P is of the required form, since the relation
S(x1, . . . , xk, m) ⇐⇒(x1, . . . , xk) ∈N(ùk, m)
is easily proved recursive by direct computation.
Conversely, if
P(x1, . . . , xk) ⇐⇒(∃n)R(x1, . . . , xk, n),
then
P = S

,
so P is semirecursive.
If both P and ¬P are semirecursive, then
P(x1, . . . , xk) ⇐⇒(∃n)R(x1, . . . , xk, n),
¬P(x1, . . . , xk) ⇐⇒(∃m)S(x1, . . . , xk, m),
with both R and S recursive. It follows that for each x1, . . . , xk there is some n such
that
R(x1, . . . , xk, n) ∨S(x1, . . . , xk, n),
so that the function
f(x1, . . . , xk) = ìn[R(x1, . . . , xk, n) ∨S(x1, . . . , xk, n)]
is recursive. Now easily
P(x1, . . . , xk) ⇐⇒R
 x1, . . . , xk, f(x1, . . . , xk)

,
so P is recursive by 3A.3.
⊣
A pointset P ⊆X is recursive if both P and ¬P = X \P are semirecursive—by 3C.2
this deﬁnition agrees with the one we already have for pointsets of type 0.
When we deﬁne recursive functions on arbitrary product spaces in 3D, we will
verify that P is recursive precisely when its characteristic function ÷P is recursive.
These pointsets are clopen, so they are trivial in connected spaces like the reals. They
are very important in studying products of ù and N.
A space X = X1 × · · · × Xk is of type 1 if each Xi is either ù or N and at least one
Xj is N. Again, P is of type 1 if P is a subset of some space X of type 1.
3C.3. Theorem. The pointclass of recursive sets contains the empty set, every product
space X, every recursive relation on ù, the pointset
{(α, n, w) : α(n) = w}
and for each space X of type 0 or 1 every basic nbhd N(X, s) as well as the basic
nbhd relation {(x, s) : x ∈N(X, s)}; moreover, it is closed under substitution of trivial
functions, ¬, & , ∨, ∃≤and ∀≤.

3C.4]
3C. Semirecursive pointsets
107
Proof. The closure properties are immediate from 3C.1 and so are the facts that ∅,
each X and each recursive relation on ù are recursive.
Recall from 3B.5 that there are recursive functions g and h such that
α ∈N(N, s) ⇐⇒
 (s)1

1 ̸= 0 &
 ∀i < g(s)

[α(i) = h(s, i)].
This implies that
α(n) = w ⇐⇒(∃s)[α ∈N(N, s) & n < g(s) & h(s, n) = w];
because the implication from right-to-left is trivial, and that from left-to-right is easy
to check if we choose s such that
α ∈N(N, s) & (∀â ∈N(N, s))[â(n) = w].
It follows that {(α, n, w) : α(n) = w} is semirecursive by 3C.1, and it is also recursive,
since
α(n) ̸= w ⇐⇒(∃m)[m ̸= w & α(n) = m].
Using again 3B.5,
α /∈N(N, s) ⇐⇒
 (s)1

1 = 0 ∨
 ∃i < g(s)

(∃w)[α(i) = w & w ̸= h(s, i)],
so {(α, s) : α /∈N(N, s)} is semirecursive and hence recursive by 3C.1. The cor-
responding set for ù is trivially recursive, and then by 3B.1 and closure under & ,
{(x, s) : x ∈N(X, s)} is recursive for every space X of type 0 or 1.
⊣
The characterization of 3C.2 extends to pointsets of type 1.
3C.4. Theorem. A pointset P ⊆X of type 0 or 1 is semirecursive if and only if there
is a recursive R ⊆X × ù such that
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃n)R(x, n).
Proof. One way is immediate by 3C.1. For the converse, assume that P ⊆X is
semirecursive with X of type 0 or 1, so that
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃n)

x ∈N

with a recursive ε. Thus it is enough to show that the relation

 X, (t)1

is recursive when X is of type 0 or 1; it is by 3C.3, since
S(x, t) ⇐⇒(∃m)[(t)1 = m & x ∈N(X, m)],
¬S(x, t) ⇐⇒(∃m)[(t)1 = m & x /∈N(X, m)].
⊣
This simple characterization cannot be extended to arbitrary spaces, since it implies
that a semirecursive set is a countable union of clopen sets,
{x : (∃n)R(x, n)} = S
n{x : R(x, n)}.
We list for the record some similar, simple normal forms in arbitrary product spaces
which are sometimes useful.

3D. Recursive and Γ-recursive functions(2,3)
With each function
f : X →Y
we associate the nbhd diagram Gf ⊆X × ù of f,
Gf(x, s) ⇐⇒f(x) ∈N(Y, s).
Clearly, Gf determines f uniquely.
We say that f is recursive if Gf is semirecursive; more generally, for each pointclass
Γ, we say that f is Γ-recursive if its nbhd diagram is in Γ.
If f is recursive, then we can eﬀectively compute arbitrarily good approximations to
f(x): given n, simply search for some s such that radius(Ns) < 2−n and f(x) ∈Ns.
It is clear that this notion of recursiveness is an eﬀective reﬁnement of continuity.
We should point out at the outset, however, that not all “simple” continuous functions
are recursive and that some of the most elementary properties of continuous functions
do not carry over to recursive functions.
Not all constant functions are recursive—only those whose constant value can be
eﬀectively approximated to any desired degree of accuracy.
It makes no sense to
ask if “f is recursive at x.” Similarly, it makes no sense to ask whether a function
f : R2 →R of two variables is “separately recursive.”
The more general notion of Γ-recursiveness is an eﬀective reﬁnement of Lebesgue’s
Γ-measurability which we introduced in 1G.
We will see in the exercises that for
suitable Γ, a function is Γ-recursive precisely when it is Γ-measurable.
To study proﬁtably Γ-recursive functions we must restrict ourselves to pointclasses
which satisfy the closure properties of the semirecursive sets. Call Γ a Σ-pointclass
if it contains all semirecursive pointsets and is closed under trivial substitutions, & ,

The ﬁrst lemma is simple but very useful:
3D.1. Lemma (Dellacherie). Let Γ be a Σ-pointclass. A function
f : X →Y
is Γ-recursive if and only if for every semirecursive set P ⊆ù × Y, the set Pf ⊆ù × X
deﬁned by
Pf(n, x) ⇐⇒P
 n, f(x)

is in Γ.
Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that f : X →Y is Γ-recursive and P ⊆ù × Y is Σ0
1. By 3C.5
then, there is a semirecursive P∗⊆ù2 such that
P(n, y) ⇐⇒(∃s){y ∈N(Y, s) & P∗(n, s)},
so that
Pf(n, x) ⇐⇒(∃s){f(x) ∈N(Y, s) & P∗(n, s)}
⇐⇒(∃s){Gf(x, s) & P∗(n, s)};
thus Pf is in Γ by the closure properties of a Σ-pointclass.
The converse is trivial, taking
P(n, y) ⇐⇒y ∈N(Y, n).
⊣
Call a sequence P0, P1, P2, . . . of subsets of some X Γ-enumerable if the relation
P(n, x) ⇐⇒Pn(x)
is in Γ. Then 3D.1 says that f : X →Y is Γ-recursive exactly when the inverse image
f−1[P0], f−1[P1], . . .
of every Σ0
1-enumerable sequence
P0, P1, . . .
of subsets of Y is a Γ-enumerable sequence of subsets of X.
3D.2. Theorem. Let Γ be a Σ-pointclass.
(i) A function f : X →ù is Γ-recursive if and only if Graph(f) ∈Γ, where
Graph(f) = {(x, n) : f(x) = n}.
(ii) If X is of type 0 and f : X →ù, then f is recursive in the present sense (i.e.,
Σ0
1-recursive) exactly when it is recursive in the sense of 3A.
(iii) Suppose Q ⊆Y1 × · · · × Yl and
P(x) ⇐⇒Q
 f1(x), . . . , fl(x)

,
where each fi is trivial or Γ-recursive into ù. If Q is in Γ, then so is P.

112
3. Basic notions of the eﬀective theory
[3D.3
Proof. (i) Assume ﬁrst that f is Γ-recursive and take
R(m, n) ⇐⇒m = n;
then R is in Σ0
1 and
f(x) = m ⇐⇒Rf(m, x),
so Graph(f) is in Γ.
Conversely, for any P ⊆ù × ù in Σ0
1,
Pf(n, x) ⇐⇒P
 n, f(x)

⇐⇒(∃m){f(x) = m & P(n, m)},
so Pf is in Γ by the closure properties of a Σ-pointclass.
(ii) is immediate from (i) and 3C.7.
(iii) To simplify notation, suppose
P(x1, x2, x3) ⇐⇒Q
 x2, g(x1, x2, x3)

,
where Q is in Γ and g : X1 × X2 × X3 →ù is Γ-recursive. Then
P(x1, x2, x3) ⇐⇒(∃m){g(x1, x2, x3) = m & Q(x2, m)}
and P is in Γ by (i) and closure of Γ under trivial substitutions, & and ∃ù.
⊣
This simple result is very useful and we will use it constantly without explicit refer-
ence. For example, if
P(x, n, m) ⇐⇒(∃t){Q(x, ⟨n, m⟩) & f
 x, (n)0

= (t)1}
with Q in Γ and f a Γ-recursive function into ù, then P is also in Γ, since
P(x, n, m) ⇐⇒(∃t){Q′(x, n, m, t) & R′(x, n, m, t)},
with Q′, R′ obtained from Q and
R(x, n, t) ⇐⇒f(x, n) = t
by suitable substitutions of trivial functions and recursive (hence Γ-recursive) func-
tions into ù.
Recall from 1G that with each
f : X →N
we have associated the “unfolding function”
f∗: X × ù →ù
deﬁned by
f∗(x, n) = f(x)(n).
3D.3. Theorem. Let Γ be a Σ-pointclass.
(i) A function f : X →N is Γ-recursive if and only if the associated f∗is Γ-recursive.
(ii) A function f : X →Y = Y1 × · · · × Yl is Γ-recursive if and only if
f(x) =
 f1(x), . . . , fl(x)

with suitable Γ-recursive functions f1, . . . , fl.

3D.5]
3D. Recursive and Γ-recursive functions
113
Proof. Assume ﬁrst that f : X →N is Γ-recursive and take
R(u, α) ⇐⇒α
 (u)0

= (u)1,
so that
Rf(u, x) ⇐⇒f(x)
 (u)0

= (u)1.
Clearly R is Σ0
1 and
f∗(x, n) = m ⇐⇒Rf(⟨n, m⟩, x),
so f∗is Γ-recursive by 3D.2.
To prove the converse we appeal to 3B.5 according to which there are recursive
functions g and h such that
α ∈N(N, s) ⇐⇒
 (s)1

1 ̸= 0 &
 ∀i < g(s)

[α(i) = h(s, i)].
Hence for f : X →N,
Gf(x, s) ⇐⇒f(x) ∈N(N, s)
⇐⇒
 (s)1

1 ̸= 0 &
 ∀i < g(s)

[f(x)(i) = h(s, i)]
⇐⇒
 (s)1

1 ̸= 0 &
 ∀i < g(s)

[f∗(x, i) = h(s, i)]
so that if f∗is Γ-recursive, then Gf is in Γ by 3D.2 again and the closure properties
of Γ.
(ii) is trivial.
⊣
This result gives the easiest method for proving that a function into a space of type 0
or 1 is Γ-recursive.
3D.4. Theorem. Let Γ be a Σ-pointclass.
(i) Every trivial function f : X →Y is recursive.
(ii) If f : X →Y is Γ-recursive and g : Y →Z is recursive, then the composition
h : X →Z,
h(x) = g
 f(x)

is Γ-recursive.
In particular, the class of recursive functions is closed under composition.
Proof. (i) is completely trivial. To prove (ii), notice that
g
 f(x)

∈N(Z, s) ⇐⇒f(x) ∈{y : g(y) ∈N(Z, s)}
⇐⇒Gg f(x), s

.
Now Gg is Σ0
1 since g is recursive and hence so is
P(s, y) ⇐⇒Gg(y, s),
so that Gh is in Γ by 3D.1.
⊣
It is not always true that the Γ-recursive functions are closed under composition.
For example, all Σ
e
0
î are Σ-pointclasses and the Σ
e
0
î-recursive functions coincide with
the Σ
e
0
î-measurable functions, see 3D.22; these are not closed under composition for
î > 1.
It is also not true in general that a Σ-pointclass is closed under substitution of
recursive functions. This is a useful special fact about Σ0
1.
3D.5. Theorem. The pointclass Σ0
1 of semirecursive sets is closed under recursive
substitution.

114
3. Basic notions of the eﬀective theory
[3D.6
Proof. Suppose P ⊆Y is Σ0
1, so
P(y) ⇐⇒(∃s)[y ∈N(Y, s) & P∗(s)]
with a semirecursive P∗by 3C.5, let f : X →Y be recursive. Then
Q(x) ⇐⇒P
 f(x)

⇐⇒(∃s)[f(x) ∈N(Y, s) & P∗(s)],
and this is obviously semirecursive.
⊣
With each pointclass Γ we associate the ambiguous part of Γ,
∆= Γ ∩¬Γ.
3D.6. Theorem. Let Γ be a Σ-pointclass. A set P ⊆X is in ∆if and only if its
characteristic function ÷P is Γ-recursive.
In particular, P is recursive if and only if ÷P is recursive.
Proof. On the one hand
÷P(x) = m ⇐⇒[P(x) & m = 1] ∨[¬P(x) & m = 0],
so if P is in ∆, then ÷P is Γ-recursive by 3D.2.
On the other hand,
P(x) ⇐⇒÷P(x) = 1,
¬P(x) ⇐⇒÷P(x) = 0,
so if ÷P is Γ-recursive both P and ¬P are in Γ easily by 3D.2.
⊣
With each pointclass Γ and each point z ∈Z we associate the relativization Γ(z) of
Γ to z: P ⊆X is in Γ(z) if there exists some Q ⊆Z × X in Γ such that
P(x) ⇐⇒Q(z, x).
In particular, the sets in Σ0
1(z) are called semirecursive in z and the functions which are
Σ0
1(z)-recursive are called recursive in z.
A point x ∈X is Γ-recursive if the set of codes of nbhds of x is in Γ, i.e., if
U(x) = {s : x ∈N(X, s)}
is in Γ. We often call these simply the points in Γ, in fact we will on occasion consider
them as members of Γ,
x ∈Γ ⇐⇒x is Γ-recursive.
The points in Σ0
1 are called recursive, the points in Σ0
1(z) are called recursive in z.
3D.7. Theorem. Let Γ be a Σ-pointclass.
(i) For each point z, Γ(z) is a Σ-pointclass.
(ii) A point x is Γ-recursive if and only if for each Y, the constant function y 7→x is
Γ-recursive.
(iii) If x is recursive in y and y is Γ-recursive, then x is Γ-recursive.
(iv) If f : X →Y is Γ-recursive, then for each x ∈X, f(x) is Γ(x)-recursive.
In particular, if f : X →Y is recursive and x is recursive, then f(x) is also recursive.
Proof. (i) is very easy and (ii) is trivial, since if f : X →Y is the constant function
y 7→x, then
Gf(y, s) ⇐⇒x ∈N(X, s) ⇐⇒s ∈U(x).
(iii) If x is recursive in y, then U(x) is in Σ0
1(y), i.e., there is a Σ0
1 set P ⊆Y × ù
such that
s ∈U(x) ⇐⇒P(y, s);

3D.10]
3D. Recursive and Γ-recursive functions
115
since y is Γ-recursive, the constant map n 7→y is Γ-recursive, so that for each
semirecursive Q, the relation
Qy(s, n) ⇐⇒Q(s, y)
is in Γ. The result follows by taking Q = {(s, y) : P(y, s)} so that
s ∈U(x) ⇐⇒Qy(s, s).
(iv) is immediate since
s ∈U
 f(x)

⇐⇒Gf(x, s)
and the last assertion comes from (iv) and (iii).

3E. The Kleene pointclasses
We now introduce the Kleene pointclasses by eﬀectivizing the deﬁnitions in 1B
and 1E. These are also called the lightface classes—notice the lightface font in the
symbols we use to denote them. By analogy, the Borel and Lusin pointclasses are
often called boldface.
Put(4)

1 = all semirecursive pointsets,
Σ0
n+1 = ∃ù¬Σ0

n+1 = ∃N ¬Σ1

n = ¬Σ1

For reasons that will become clear later, we call the pointsets in S
n Σ0
n arithmetical
and the pointsets in S
n Σ1
n analytical. They are the eﬀective versions of the ﬁnite Borel
and the projective sets respectively.
Notice the possible source of conﬂict between the term “analytical” and the classical
name “analytic” for Σ
e
1
1 sets. One way to avoid confusion is to observe scrupulously
the diﬀerence in suﬃx between these two words; people have been careless with this
pedantic distinction, especially in some early papers in recursion theory. It is prudent
to say “Σ
e
1
1” rather than “analytic” in contexts where analytical sets are also discussed.
We can also deﬁne the relativized Kleene pointclasses Σ0
n(z), Π0
n(z), Σ1
n(z), Π1
n(z) by
the general process we described in 3D. Again,
∆0
n(z) = Σ0
n(z) ∩Π0
n(z),
∆1
n(z) = Σ1
n(z) ∩Π1
n(z).
One should be careful with this notation, since it is not the case that ∆0
n(z) is the
relativization of ∆0
n to z, see 3F.9.
The sets in S
n Σ0
n(z) are called arithmetical in z and the sets in S
n Σ1
n(z) are called
analytical in z.
We will not always bother to state explicitly results about these
relativized notions since they are similar to those about the absolute pointclasses and
they are obtained (usually) by the same arguments.
The basic properties of the Kleene pointclasses can be established very easily, simply
by copying the proofs in Chapter 1 and substituting “semirecursive” for “open” and

3E.3]
3E. The Kleene pointclasses
119
“recursive function” for “continuous function.”
We will do this somewhat more
generally, so we will not have to repeat it when we introduce new pointclasses later on.
The normal forms for the ﬁnite Borel and Lusin pointclasses carry over to the
Kleene pointclasses immediately. For example, P is Σ0
2 if there is a Π0
1 set F so that
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃t)F (x, t),
P is Σ0
3 if there is a Σ0
1 (semirecursive) set G so that
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃t1)(∀t2)G(x, t1, t2),
etc. Similarly, P is Σ1
1 if there is a Π0
1 set F such that
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃α)F (x, α),
P is Σ1
2 is there is a semirecursive G such that
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃α1)(∀α2)G(x, α1, α2),
etc.
These forms become a bit simpler for spaces of type 0 or 1 because of the charac-
terization in 3C.4. Thus, if P is a pointset of type 0 or 1, then P is Π0
1 if there is a
recursive R such that
P(x) ⇐⇒(∀t)R(x, t),
P is Σ0
2 if there is a recursive R such that
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃t1)(∀t2)R(x, t1, t2),
P is Σ1
2 if there is a recursive R such that
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃α)(∀t)R(x, α, t),
etc.
The key to the closure properties of the Kleene pointclasses are the closure properties
of Σ0
1 given in 3C.1 and 3D.5.
To simplify statements of results, let us call a pointclass Γ adequate if it contains
all recursive pointsets and is closed under recursive substitution, & , ∨, ∃≤and ∀≤.
Clearly Σ0
1 is adequate and closed under ∃ù; ∆0
1 is adequate and closed under ¬.
Recall the notation we introduced in 1F, where for a pointclass Λ and a pointset

To prove the inclusion diagrams we imitate the proofs of 1B.1 and 1E.1. The only
new ingredient we need is a proof of

since the proof of Σ

2 given in 1B.1 does not immediately yield the lightface
version.
All recursive pointsets of type 0 are clearly in Σ0
2 (by vacuous quantiﬁcation). Also,
Σ0
2 is closed under trivial substitutions, & , ∨, ∃≤, ∀≤and ∃ù by 3E.2; hence to show
that Σ0
1 ⊆Σ0
2 by applying 3C.12 it is enough to verify that for each basic space X the
relation
PX (x, i, m, k) ⇐⇒d(ri, x) <

k + 1
is in Σ0

In particular, P ⊆X is in Γ

if and only if P is in Γ(ε) for some ε ∈N, i.e., if and

Also for the ambiguous pointclasses, P is ∆

We leave for the exercises similar strong versions of the parametrization and hierar-
chy theorems 1D.1–1D.4.
Clearly all Σ0
n are Σ-pointclasses, as are all Σ1
n, Π1
n and ∆1
n, so we can study recursion
theory for them. The case of Σ0
n-recursion is somewhat interesting and some of the
exercises will deal with it.
Here we are interested in ∆1
1-recursion, the eﬀective reﬁnement of Borel measurability.
3E.5. Theorem. (i) The following four conditions on a function f : X →Y are
equivalent:
(1) f is ∆1
1-recursive.
(2) f is Σ1
1-recursive.
(3) Graph(f) = {(x, y) : f(x) = y} is Σ1
1.
(4) Graph(f) is ∆1
1.
(ii) All the analytical pointclasses Σ1
n, Π1
n, ∆1
n are closed under substitution of ∆1
1-
recursive functions.
Proof. (i) (1)=⇒(2) is immediate and (2)=⇒(3) follows from the equivalence
f(x) = y ⇐⇒(∀s){y ∈N(Y, s) =⇒f(x) ∈N(Y, s)}.
To prove (3)=⇒(4) notice that
f(x) ̸= y ⇐⇒(∃z){f(x) = z & z ̸= y}
and for (4)=⇒(1) use
f(x) ∈N(Y, s) ⇐⇒(∃y){f(x) = y & y ∈N(Y, s)}
⇐⇒(∀y){f(x) ̸= y ∨y ∈N(Y, s)}.
(ii) is immediate from the equivalences
P

⇐⇒(∃y){f(x) = y & P(y)}
⇐⇒(∀y){f(x) ̸= y ∨P(y)}.
⊣
We often say “∆1
1 function” instead of “∆1
1-recursive function.” For the moment, we
think of these as the eﬀective Borel functions simply because Borel measurability is
the same as ∆
e
1
1-measurability by Suslin’s Theorem. In Chapter 7 we will look at some
deeper reasons for the analogy.
We now state eﬀective versions of the “Transfer Theorems” 1G.2 and 1G.3. These
are very important as they allow us to reduce the study of the analytical Kleene
pointclasses to the study of analytical sets of irrationals.
3E.6. Theorem. For every product space X there is a recursive surjection
ð : N ։ X

3E.7. Theorem. For every perfect product space X there is a ∆1
1 bijection
g : N ֌

whose inverse g−1 is also ∆1
1.
Proof. As in 1G, we call an injection
f : X ֌ Y
a good ∆1
1 injection if there is a ∆1
1 surjection
f∗: Y ։ X
such that
f∗f(x) = x.
Using the proof of 1G.4 and 3D.15 we can easily show the existence of good ∆1
1
injections
h : N ֌ X,
f : X ֌ N.
Deﬁne now the sets Nn, Xn exactly as in the proof of 1G.4. It is enough to prove
that the four relations
α ∈Nn,
x ∈Xn,
α ∈f[Xn],
x ∈h[Nn]
are ∆1
1. From this it is immediate that the bijection g deﬁned in the proof of 1G.4 has
∆1
1 graph and is therefore ∆1
1 by 3E.5.
Let us concentrate on the relation α ∈Nn. To begin with, it is almost trivial that
α ∈Nn ⇐⇒(∃â)

(â)i+1 = fh

(1)
We prove direction (=⇒) of (1) by choosing â0, â1, . . . , ân so that â1 = fh(â0),
â2 = fh(â1), . . . , ân = fh(ân−1) = α and then picking â so that for i < n, (â)i = âi.
For the direction (⇐=), choose any â which satisﬁes the matrix on the right of (1)
and verify by induction on i < n that (â)i+1 ∈Ni+1, so that α = (â)n ∈Nn.
Equivalence (1) establishes that the relation α ∈Nn is Σ1
1. To show that this relation
is also Π1
1, we need the slightly less perspicuous equivalence
(2)
α ∈Nn ⇐⇒(∀â)

where f∗and h∗are ∆1
1 “inverses” of the good ∆1

Proof of direction (=⇒) of (2) is by induction on n. For n = 0, α ∈N0 = N and
the right hand side is vacuously true. Assume α ∈Nn+1, so that for some ã ∈Nn we
have
α = fh(ã)
and therefore
h∗f∗(α) = ã.

from which it
follows immediately that for each i < n, (â)i+1 ∈Ni+1, so that α = (â)n ∈Nn.
A symmetric argument establishes that the relation x ∈Xn is ∆1
1. Finally,
α ∈f[Xn] ⇐⇒α ∈f[X] & f∗(α) ∈Xn
⇐⇒ff∗(α) = α & f∗(α) ∈Xn
so that α ∈f[Xn] is ∆1
1 and similarly for the relation x ∈h[Nn].
⊣
The analytical pointclasses are not closed under the inﬁnitary operations of count-
able union and intersection. Because of this, it is not obvious what is the correct
eﬀective version of the Suslin Theorem. Actually, there is a beautiful result of Kleene
which characterizes ∆1
1 as the smallest pointclass containing all semirecursive sets and
closed under “eﬀective” countable union and complementation. This is quite diﬃcult
and we will leave it for Chapter 7.

It is almost obvious from the deﬁnitions that there are only countably many recursive
functions. Here we will prove the much stronger result that Σ0
1 is ù-parametrized.
The reader with some knowledge of basic recursion theory will want to skip this
section, after he peruses the ﬁnal results 3F.6 and 3F.7.
Let us go back to the deﬁnition of the class of number theoretic recursive functions
in 3A and analyse it.
A recursive derivation is a sequence
f0, f1, . . . , fn
of (number theoretic) functions such that each fj is the successor function S, one of
the constants C k
w or the projections Pk
i or else can be deﬁned by composition, primitive
recursion or minimalization from functions preceding it in the sequence f0, . . . , fn.
We can think of a recursive derivation as a proof that fn is recursive.
3F.1. Theorem. A function f : ùk →ù is recursive if and only if there is a recursive
derivation f0, . . . , fn with fn = f.
Proof. If f0, . . . , fn is a recursive derivation, then each fi is recursive by induction
on i. On the other hand, the collection of all functions which occur in recursive
derivations obviously contains S,all C k
w, Pk
i and is closed under composition,primitive
recursion an minimalization, so it contains every recursive function.
⊣
To verify that a given sequence of functions f0, . . . , fn is a recursive derivation,
we must give a justiﬁcation for including each fj in the list—because fj is S or fj
is deﬁned from functions listed before it by composition, etc. We now give a formal
coding of such justiﬁcations by ﬁnite sequences of numbers.
Let a sequence f0, . . . , fn of functions and a sequence ˆf0, . . . , ˆfn of numbers be
given. We say that ˆf0, . . . , ˆfn is a justiﬁcation for f0, . . . , fn, if one of the following
conditions holds for each j ≤n.
Case 1. fj = S and ˆfj = ⟨1, 1⟩.
Case 2. fj = C k
w and ˆfj = ⟨2, k, w⟩.
Case 3. fj = Pk
i (1 ≤i ≤k) and ˆfj = ⟨3, k, i⟩.
Case 4. fj(x1, . . . , xk) = h
 g1(x), . . . , gm(x)

where the functions h, g1, . . . , gm
precede fj in the list f0, . . . , fn and
ˆfj =

4, k, ⟨ˆh, ˆg1, . . . , ˆgm⟩

.
By this ofcourse we mean thath = fj0, g1 = fj1, . . . , gm = fjm with j0, j1, . . . , jm <
j and
ˆfj =

4, k, ⟨ˆfj0, ˆfj1, . . . , ˆfjm⟩

,
and similarly for the next two cases.
Case 5(i).
fj(0, x) = g(x),
fj(n + 1, x) = h
 fj(n, x), n, x

,

[3F.2
where g and hprecede fj in the list and

Case 5(ii).
fj(0) = w0,
fj(n + 1) = h
 fj(n), n

,
where h precedes fj in the list and
ˆfj =

5, 1, ⟨w0, ˆh⟩

.
Case 6. fj(x) = ìm[g(m, x) = 0], where g precedes fj in the list and
ˆfj = ⟨6, k, ˆg⟩.
It is now immediate that every recursive derivation has a justiﬁcation and that if
f0, . . . , fn has a justiﬁcation, then f0, . . . , fn is a recursive derivation. All we have
done is to code with ﬁnite sequences of numbers all canonical proofs that particular
sequences of functions are recursive derivations.
More than that, our coding is one-to-one in a very strong sense.
3F.2. Theorem. Suppose ˆf0, . . . , ˆfn is a justiﬁcation for f0, . . . , fn, ˆg0, . . . , ˆgm is a
justiﬁcation for g0, . . . , gm and for some j ≤n, i ≤m we have ˆfj = ˆgi. Then fj = gi.
Proof is by induction on the number ˆfj. There are six cases to the proof corre-
sponding to the deﬁnition of a justiﬁcation, but looking at just two of them will be
suﬃcient to give the idea.
Case 2. ˆfj = ⟨2, k, w⟩for some k, w. Then fj = C k
w and since also ˆgi = ⟨2, k, w⟩,
we have gi = C k
w = fj.
Case 6.
ˆfj = ⟨6, k, z⟩for some numbers k ≥1, z. Now by the deﬁnition of a
justiﬁcation, it follows that fj is a k-ary function and that for some fl with l < j, fl
is (k + 1)-ary, z = ˆfl and
fj(x) = ìt[fl(t, x) = 0].
Now z = ( ˆfj)2 < ˆfj, so by induction hypothesis fl = gs and hence fj = gi.
⊣
Put
C = {z : there exists some sequence of integers z0, . . . , zn = z
which is a justiﬁcation for a recursive derivation}.
It follows from 3F.2, that if z ∈C, then in every justiﬁcation in which z occurs it
“codes” the same function, call it fz. We call C the set of codes of recursive functions.
since the map z 7→fz takes C onto the recursive functions, we have proved the ﬁrst
main result of this section.
3F.3. Theorem. There are only countably many recursive number theoretic functions.
⊣
Our coding is such that if z ∈C, then fz is k-ary with k = (z)1.
For ﬁxed
x1, . . . , xk, m, let us think of the number

z, ⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩, m

as a code of the assertion that
fz(x1, . . . , xk) = m.

3F.4]
3F. Universal sets for the Kleene pointclasses
127
Of course this assertion may be true or false. We now construct a semirecursive set A
such that for every z ∈C, A contains all codes of true assertions

z, ⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩, m

and no codes of false assertions about fz. Notice that A will contain many members
of the form

z, ⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩, m

where z /∈C—these will give us no information about
recursive functions.
The set A is the smallest set of integers satisfying (1)–(6), where the symbols ˆf, ˆg,
ˆh are used just as variables over ù.

for every n,
⟨ˆf, ⟨n⟩, n + 1⟩∈A.
(2) If ˆf = ⟨2, k, w⟩for some k ≥1 and some w, then

(3) If ˆf = ⟨3, k, i⟩for some k ≥1 and 1 ≤i ≤k, then
for every x1, . . . , xk,

 ˆf, ⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩, xi

(4) If ˆf =

for some ˆh, ˆg1, . . . , ˆgm and if for some x1, . . . , xk,

3. Basic notions of the eﬀective theory
[3F.5
Proof. We show ﬁrst the second assertion, which holds only for z ∈C, i.e., there is
no suggestion that whenever

z, ⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩, w

∈A, then we must have z ∈C.
Proof of the implication
fz(x1, . . . , xk) = w =⇒

z, ⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩, w

∈A.
is by induction on the code z ∈C and it is easy. For example, if z = ⟨6, k, e⟩, then we
know that e codes a (k + 1)-ary function fe and
fz(x1, . . . , xk) = ìm[fe(m, x1, . . . , xk) = 0].
Thus if fz(x1, . . . , xk) = m, then there are numbers w0, . . . , wm−1, all ̸= 0 such that
fe(0, x1, . . . , xk) = w0, . . . , fe(m−1, x1, . . . , xk) = wm−1 and fe(m, x1, . . . , xk) = 0.
Now e = (z)2 < z, so we can apply the induction hypothesis on these assertions,
whence by clause (6) in the deﬁning conditions for A,

z, ⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩, m

∈A.
We will omit the other cases of this induction, but it is worth pointing out that in
case (5), when z =

5, k + 1, ⟨e, u⟩

for some k, e, u the implication
fz(n, x1, . . . , xk) = w =⇒

z, ⟨n, x1, . . . , xk⟩, w

∈A
is proved by induction on n.
To prove the converse implication, notice that if v ∈A, then v must be of the
form in one of the conclusions of the clauses (1)–(6) and it must satisfy the corre-
sponding hypothesis, e.g., v =

 ˆf, ⟨0, x1, . . . , xk⟩, w0

for some x1, . . . , xk, w0 and
ˆf =

5, k + 1, ⟨ˆg, ˆh⟩

and

ˆg, ⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩, w0

∈A; because if v is not of the proper
form or does not satisfy the corresponding hypothesis, then A\{v} satisﬁes all (1)–(6)
and hence A \ {v} ⊇A by the deﬁnition of A, i.e., v /∈A. Now the implication

z, ⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩, w

∈A =⇒fz(x1, . . . , xk) = w
can be proved for every code z by induction on z easily, just as the converse implication
was proved.
We now outline a proof of the ﬁrst assertion of the theorem, that A is semirecursive.
The idea is to analyze the inductive deﬁnition of A in the same way that we analyzed
the inductive deﬁnition of the class of recursive functions. Thus an A-derivation is a
ﬁnite sequence of numbers
u0, u1, . . . , un
which proves that un ∈A, i.e., each ui is in A either by virtue of clauses (1), (2), (3)
or by virtue of one of the remaining clauses and the fact that certain uj’s with j < i
are of a certain form. Once this is written down explicitly, it is trivial to check that the
relation
P(u) ⇐⇒Seq(u) & (∃n ≤u)[lh(u) = n & (u)0, . . . , (u)n−1 is an A-derivation]
is recursive. But
v ∈A ⇐⇒(∃u)(∃n)[P(u) & lh(u) = n & v = (u)n−1],
so that A is semirecursive.

semirecursive and parametrize the semirecursive subsets of ù and put
H(z, x) ⇐⇒(∃s)[x ∈N(X, s) & G(z, s)].
By 3C.5, H is universal for Σ0

If Y = ùn for some n, take
H ′(z1, . . . , zn, x) ⇐⇒H(z1, x)
with this H.
If Y is not of type 0, then Y is perfect. Choose a recursive ó which satisﬁes Lemma
1A.2 by 3D.15 for the space Y. Given a space X, let G be as above and put
H(y, x) ⇐⇒(∃u)(∃z)


& (∃s)[x ∈N(X, s) & G(z, s)]

Clearly H is semirecursive.
Fix y ∈Y and suppose that for some x, H(y, x) holds. It follows easily from the
properties of ó that there is a unique sequence code u of the form ⟨0, 0, . . . , 0, 1⟩and
length z + 1 such that for all x,
H(y, x) ⇐⇒(∃s)[x ∈N(X, s) & G(z, s)].
Thus
Hy = {x : H(y, x)}
is a semirecursive subset of X.
Conversely, if
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃s)[x ∈N(X, s) & G(z, s)]
is any semirecursive subset of X, take u with lh(u) = z +1, u = ⟨0, 0, . . . , 0, 1⟩, choose
any y ∈N
 Y, ó(u)

and verify easily that
H(y, x) ⇐⇒(∃s)[x ∈N(X, s) & G(z, s)]
⇐⇒P(x),
so that P = Hy.

3G. Partial functions and the substitution property
The notion of Γ-recursion is an eﬀective reﬁnement of the classical notion of Γ-
measurability and its basic properties can be established easily when Γ is a Σ-pointclass,
as we saw in 3D. To obtain a smoother theory of Γ-recursion which reﬁnes the classical
theory of continuous functions we must impose an additional condition on Γ which
will insure (in particular) that Γ is closed under substitution of Γ-recursive functions.

3G]
3G. Partial functions and the substitution property
131
As it turns out, the correct formulation of this substitution property involves partial
functions in a natural way.
A partial function on X to Y is simply a (total) function
f : D →Y
with domain some subset D of X. We will use the notation
f : X ⇀Y
for partial functions, and the corresponding
f : X )⇀Y,
f : X ⇀
⇀Y
for partial injections and partial surjections, deﬁned in the obvious way. We also write
f(x)↓⇐⇒f is deﬁned at x,
so that
D = Domain(f) = {x ∈X : f(x)↓}.
The domain of the composition of two partial functions is deﬁned in the natural way:
f
 g(x)

↓⇐⇒g(x)↓& [if g(x) = y, then f(y)↓].
In particular, if
f(x) =
 f1(x), . . . , fl(x)

with f1, . . . , fl partial, then
f(x)↓⇐⇒f1(x)↓& · · · & fl(x)↓.
We should emphasize that when we call f : X ⇀Y a partial function, f could be
total; but when we call f a function, then in fact f must be total, i.e., Domain(f) = X.
If f : X ⇀Y is a partial function, D ⊆Domain(f) and P ⊆X × ù is some
pointset, we say that P computes f on D if
x ∈D =⇒(∀s)[f(x) ∈Ns ⇐⇒P(x, s)].
In the notation we introduced in 3D, we can rewrite this as
x ∈D =⇒U
 f(x)

= {s : P(x, s)} = Px.
A partial function f : X ⇀Y is Γ-recursive on D if some P in Γ computes f on
D. Most often we will be looking at partial functions which are Γ-recursive on their
domain; if f is Γ-recursive on D = Domain(f) and in addition Domain(f) is in Γ,
we say that f is Γ-recursive. If Γ = Σ0
1, we say recursive for Σ0
1-recursive.
The class of recursive partial functions has been studied extensively on ù, but in
the wider context of product spaces it is diﬃcult to control the domains of partial
functions and the weaker notion of recursion on a set D is more useful.
It is clear that if f : X →Y is total, then f is Γ-recursive (on X) in the present
sense exactly when it is Γ recursive in the sense of 3D.
The condition we want to impose on a pointclass Γ is (roughly) that it be closed
under substitution of partial functions which are Γ-recursive on some set D, at least
when we restrict these substitutions to the points in D. Precisely: a pointclass Γ has the
substitution property if for each Q ⊆Y in Γ and for each partial function f : X ⇀Y
which is Γ-recursive on its domain, there is some Q∗⊆X in Γ such that for all x ∈X,
f(x)↓=⇒[Q∗(x) ⇐⇒Q
 f(x)

].

132
3. Basic notions of the eﬀective theory
[3G.1
Σ-pointclasses with the substitution property carry a very reasonable recursion
theory, particularly if they are ù-parametrized (as is Σ0
1). We will come back to this in
Chapter 7, but we will ﬁrst put down here the few facts that we need in the interim.
3G.1. Theorem. If Γ is a Σ-pointclass with the substitution property, then the collec-
tion of partial functions which are Γ-recursive on their domain is closed under composi-
tion; moreover, Γ is closed under the substitution of Γ-recursive (total) functions, so in
particular, Γ is adequate.
Proof. The second assertion is immediate.
To prove the ﬁrst assertion, suppose g : X ⇀Y, f : Y ⇀Z are both Γ-recursive
on their domains, computed by P ⊆X × ù and Q ⊆Y × ù respectively and let
h(x) = f
 g(x)

. Now if h(x)↓, then g(x)↓, say g(x) = y and f(y)↓. Since Q
computes f, we have
(∀s)[f(y) ∈Ns ⇐⇒Q(y, s)]
i.e.,
(∀s)

f
 g(x)

∈Ns ⇐⇒Q
 g(x), s

.
Since g is Γ-recursive on its domain, so is (easily) the map
(x, s) 7→
 g(x), s

;
thus by the substitution property, there is some Q∗in Γ so that
g(x)↓=⇒[Q
 g(x), s

⇐⇒Q∗(x, s)].
It follows immediately that
h(x)↓=⇒(∀s)[h(x) ∈Ns ⇐⇒Q∗(x, s)]
so that h is Γ recursive on its domain.
⊣
Let us now verify that the substitution property is easy to establish.
3G.2. Theorem. (i) Σ0
1 has the substitution property.
(ii) If Γ is a Σ-pointclass with the substitution property, then so is each relativization
Γ(w).
(iii) If Γ is a Σ-pointclass closed under ∀ù and either ∃Y or ∀Y, then Γ has the
substitution property; in particular, Σ1
n, Π1
n all do.
Proof. (i) Suppose Q ⊆Y is semirecursive, so that by 3C.5
Q(y) ⇐⇒(∃s)[y ∈Ns & Q′(s)],
with a semirecursive Q′. If f : X ⇀Y is partial and computed on its domain by some
semirecursive P ⊆X × ù, put
Q∗(x) ⇐⇒(∃s)[P(x, s) & Q′(s)];
now if f(x)↓, then
f(x) ∈Ns ⇐⇒P(x, s),
so that
Q∗(x) ⇐⇒(∃s)[f(x) ∈Ns & Q′(s)]
⇐⇒Q

Q(y) ⇐⇒Q′(w, y)

for some Q′ in Γ and suppose that f : X ⇀Y is computed on its domain by some
P ⊆X × ù in Γ(w); again
P(x, s) ⇐⇒P′(w, x, s)
for some P′ in Γ. Now P′ computes on its domain the partial function f′ : W×X →Y
deﬁned by
f′(w′, x)↓⇐⇒for some y, U(y) = {s : P′(w′, x, s)},
f′(w′, x)↓=⇒(∀s)[f′(w′, x) ∈Ns ⇐⇒P′(w′, x, s)].
Notice that for the speciﬁc ﬁxed w we have
f(x)↓=⇒f′(w, x)↓
f(x) = f′(w, x).
The partial function
g(w′, x) =
 w′, f′(w′, x)

is Γ-recursive on its domain, so by the substitution property for Γ, there is some
Q′′ ⊆W × X in Γ so that
g(w′, x)↓=⇒

Q′′(w′, x) ⇐⇒Q′ w′, f′(w′, x)

setting w′ = w then, we have
f(x)↓=⇒


Q′′(w, x) ⇐⇒Q
 f(x)

and we can take
Q∗(x) ⇐⇒Q′′(w, x)
to satisfy the substitution property for Γ.
(iii) Suppose the partial function f : X ⇀Y is computed on its domain by
P ⊆X × ù in Γ, Q ⊆Y is in Γ and Γ is closed under ∀ù and ∃Y. Take
Q∗(x) ⇐⇒(∃y)

Q(y) & (∀s)[y ∈Ns =⇒P(x, s)]

.
This is easily in Γ and if f(x)↓, then for any y,
(∀s)[y ∈Ns =⇒P(x, s)] =⇒(∀s)[y ∈Ns =⇒f(x) ∈Ns] =⇒y = f(x),
so that
Q∗(x) ⇐⇒Q
 f(x)

.
Similarly, if Γ is closed under ∀Y, take
Q∗(x) ⇐⇒(∀y)

Q(y) ∨(∃s)[P(x, s) & y /∈Ns]

.
⊣
To appreciate the reason we use partial functions in formulating the substitution
property, one should spend a few minutes trying to prove that if a Σ-pointclass Γ is
closed under (total) Γ-recursive substitutions, then each relativization Γ(w) is closed
under Γ(w)-recursive substitutions.

B =

(ii) A partial function f : X ⇀N is Γ-recursive on its domain if and only if the
partial function f∗: X × ù ⇀ù is Γ-recursive on its domain, where

3H. Codings, uniformity and good parametrizations
A coding for a set A is any surjection
ð : D ։ A
of a set D = Domain(ð) onto A. If α ∈A and ð(c) = α, we call c a code for α in the
coding ð.
In our case we will always have D ⊆X for some product space X (usually N), so
we can think of a coding in X as a partial surjection
ð : X ⇀
⇀A,
i.e., some partial function ð : X ⇀Y such that ð[Domain(ð)] = A.
Let us look at some examples.
(1) The set ù codes the collection of basic nbhds of a product space X by the map
ð(s) = Ns.
(2) The set of integers C deﬁned in 3F codes the collection of recursive functions
on ù by the map
ð(z) = fz
(z ∈C).
(3) Suppose Γ is N-parametrized and G ⊆N × X is universal for the Γ-subsets of
X. The map
α 7→Gα = {x : G(α, x)}
codes the Γ-subsets of X in N.
(4) With Γ and G as above, let
C = {α : G(α)0 is the complement of G(α)1}.
Now each α ∈C determines a set G(α)0 in ∆, so that the partial map
ð(α) = G(α)0
(α ∈C)
is a coding of ∆↾X.
(5) Fix a space X and ﬁx an open set G ⊆N × X which is universal for the open
subsets of X. For each countable ordinal î deﬁne the set Bî of codes for Σ
e
0
î by the
recursion:
B0 = {α : α(0) = 0}
Bî = {α : α(0) = 1 & (∀n)[(α⋆)n ∈S

where
α⋆(t) = α(t + 1).

where

It is obvious that each ðî is a coding for the Σ

an easy induction on î that
0 < ç ≤î =⇒[Bç ⊆Bî & ðç = ðî ↾Bç]

If we take Γ = Σ
e

1 subsets of X.
In (5) we deﬁned a coding for the Borel subsets of X, and by the Suslin theorem every
∆
e
1
1 subset of X is Borel. We will show in Chapter 7 that the Suslin theorem holds
uniformly in the codings in the following sense: there is a partial function
f : N ⇀N
which is (Σ0
1-)recursive on the set C (in particular C ⊆Domain(f)) and such that if α
is a ∆
e
1
1-code of A ⊆X, then f(α) is a Borel code of A. This Suslin-Kleene Theorem is
one of the central results of the eﬀective theory.
To deﬁne this important notion of uniformity is general, suppose that
ð : X ⇀
⇀A,
ñ : Y ⇀
⇀B
are codings for the sets A, B (ð, ñ are partial functions), suppose R ⊆A × B is a
relation on A × B and suppose that Γ is a ﬁxed Σ-pointclass with the substitution
property. We say that the assertion
(∀a ∈A)(∃b ∈B)R(a, b)
(∗)

i.e., whenever x codes some a ∈A, then f(x) gives us a code of some b ∈B so that
R(a, b).
In the important case Γ = Σ0
1, we talk of recursive uniformity or simply uniformity.
To take a trivial example, let ∆= Γ ∩¬Γ be coded in N as in (4) and consider the
assertion
∆is closed under complementation,
i.e.,
(∀P ∈∆)(∃Q ∈∆)[Q is the complement of P];
this holds uniformly because the function
α 7→⟨(α)1, (α)0⟩
is recursive (and hence recursive on the set C of codes).

For a slightly more interesting example, take the assertion “if g, h1, . . . , hm are
recursive functions on ù with the proper number of arguments, then the composition
f(x) = g
 h1(x), . . . , hm(x)

is also recursive.” Using the coding (2) above for recursive functions on ù we can
easily show that this statement holds uniformly: i.e., there is a recursive function
u( ˆg, ˆh1, . . . , ˆhm) so that whenever ˆg, ˆh1, . . . , ˆhm code (in C) recursive functions with
the appropriate number of variables, then u( ˆg, ˆh1, . . . , ˆhm) codes their composition.
We will often call any partial function f which satisﬁes (1) above a uniformity (which
establishes that (∗) holds Γ-uniformly).
Starting with the next chapter, we will meet several situations in which codings and
uniformities come up naturally and non-trivially. Here we will conﬁne ourselves to
one simple but very useful preparatory result.
With each pointclass Γ we associate the boldface pointclass Γ
e
, where for P ⊆X,
P ∈Γ
e
⇐⇒there is some P∗⊆N × X, P∗∈Γ and some ε ∈N so that
P = P∗
ε = {x : P∗(ε, x)}.

3H.1. The Good Parametrization Lemma. Suppose Γ is ù-parametrized and closed
under recursive substitutions. Then we can associate with each space X a set G ⊆N ×X
in Γ which is universal for Γ
e
↾X and so that the following properties hold:
(i) For P ⊆X,
P ∈Γ ⇐⇒P = GX
ε with a recursive ε ∈N.
(ii) For each space X of type 0 or 1 and each Y, there is a recursive function
SX,Y = S : N × X →N
so that
GX×Y(ε, x, y) ⇐⇒GY S(ε, x), y

.
Proof. If G ⊆ù × N × X parametrizes Γ ↾(N × X), take
G∗(ε, x) ⇐⇒G
 ε(0), ε⋆, x

with ε⋆(t) = ε(t + 1) and check easily that G∗parametrizes Γ
e
↾X so that (i) holds.
Thus we may assume that we are given parametrizations of Γ
e
in Γ which satisfy (i)—we
must obtain a new system of parametrizations which also satisﬁes (ii).
Call a space Y (for this proof) simple if Y has no initial factor of type 0 or 1, i.e., if
it is impossible to write
Y = Y1 × Y2
with Y1 of type 0 or 1. We will ﬁrst construct suitable parametrizations for all spaces
of the form X × Y with X of type 0 or 1 together with a ﬁxed simple space Y.
For each space X of type 0 or 1 then ﬁx a recursive homeomorphism
ðX : N × X ֌
→N
and let
V ⊆N × (N × N × Y)

Clearly G is in Γ.
To prove that G is universal for Γ

Q′(α, â, y) ⇐⇒V (ε, α, â, y)
and for any α, taking â = ðX(α, x) we have
Q(x, y) ⇐⇒Q′ α, ðX(α, x), y

⇐⇒V
 ε, α, ðX(α, x), y

⇐⇒G(⟨ε, α, α⟩, x, y).
Choosing a recursive α, say t 7→0 and ε∗= ⟨ε, α, α⟩we have
Q(x, y) ⇐⇒G(ε∗, x, y).
It is also immediate that the universal set G satisﬁes (i).
Fix spaces X, W of type 0 or 1; we must construct a recursive function
S : N × X →N
so that
G(ε, x, w, y) ⇐⇒G

for a ﬁxed recursive ε∗,
P(α, â, y) ⇐⇒V (ε∗, α, â, y).
(3)
For arbitrary ε, x, w, let
α = ⟨ε, ðX(ε, x)⟩,
â = ðW(ε, w);
substituting in (2) and (3) we get
G(ε, x, w, y) ⇐⇒P

The construction is similar for spaces of type 0 or 1 ( simply skip the Y above)
and the universal sets we constructed work for the simple spaces (skip the W in the
proof).
⊣
A system of sets GX ⊆N × X in Γ which are Γ
e
-universal and satisfy (i) and (ii)
of the theorem will be called a good parametrization (in Γ for Γ
e
).
We will often
simply say “let G ⊆N × X be a good universal set” meaning that G belongs to a
good parametrization when Γ is clear from the context. We will also tend to be a bit
sloppy with notation and avoid all superscripts, so that the basic property of good
parametrization reads
G(ε, x, y) ⇐⇒G
 S(ε, x), y

.
Fix a good parametrization for each ù-parametrized, adequate pointclass Γ and
consider the natural coding for Γ
e
determined by this parametrization as in (3) above,
by the map
α 7→Gα = {x ∈X : G(α, x)}.
The restriction of these maps to recursive α’s gives a coding for Γ.
Similarly, ∆
e
is coded by
α 7→G(α)0,
on the set of codes {α : G(α)0 is the complement of G(α)1}.
When we mention Γ
e
-codes or ∆
e
-codes of sets, we will refer to these ﬁxed, canonical
codings—we will do this quite frequently for Σ
e
1
n-codes or ∆
e
1
n-codes, for example.
Lemma 3H.1 says that the operation of passing to a section at a point of type 0 or 1
is uniform, for an ù-parametrized, adequate Γ: i.e., if ε codes P ⊆X × Y in Γ
e
with
X of type 0 or 1, then S(ε, x) codes Px = {y : P(x, y)} in Γ
e
. But the lemma actually
implies much more.
3H.2. The Uniform Closure Theorem. Suppose Γ is an ù-parametrized, adequate
pointclass; if Γ is closed under any of the operations & , ∨, ∃≤, ∀≤, ∃Y, ∀Y, then
Γ
e
is uniformly closed under the same operation (in the codings induced by a good
parametrization).
Proof. Suppose for example that Γ is closed under & . We must show that there is
a recursive function u(α, â) such that if
P(x) ⇐⇒G(α, x)
Q(x) ⇐⇒G(â, x),
then
P(x) & Q(x) ⇐⇒G
 u(α, â), x

.
To check this, put
R(α, â, x) ⇐⇒G(α, x) & G(â, x).
By closure under recursive substitution and & , R is in Γ, so for a ﬁxed recursive
ε∗∈N,
R(α, â, x) ⇐⇒G(ε∗, α, â, x)

by the good parametrization lemma. Thus we can take
u(α, â) = S(ε∗, α, â).
The argument for the other cases is similar.
⊣
There is another somewhat tricky corollary of the good parametrization lemma
which can be viewed as ﬁxed-point theorem for parametrized pointclasses. We put it
down here because we need it for an important application in the next chapter, but its
full signiﬁcance will not be appreciated until Chapter 7.
3H.3. Kleene’s Recursion Theorem for Relations. Suppose Γ is ù-parametrized
and closed under recursive substitutions and suppose R ⊆N × X is in Γ; then we can
ﬁnd a recursive ε∗∈N so that the section
Rε∗= {x : R(ε∗, x)}
has Γ
e
-code ε∗, i.e.,
R(ε∗, x) ⇐⇒G(ε∗, x)
where G is the ﬁxed good universal set for Γ
e
↾X.
Proof. Let
P(α, x) ⇐⇒R
 S(α, α), x

where S is recursive by 3H.1 and such that for all ε, α, x,
G(ε, α, x) ⇐⇒G
 S(ε, α), x

.
Since P is in Γ, there is a ﬁxed recursive ε0 so that
P(α, x) ⇐⇒G(ε0, α, x)
⇐⇒G
 S(ε0, α), x

and hence for all α, x,
G
 S(ε0, α), x

⇐⇒R
 S(α, α), x

.
Now set α = ε0 in this equivalence and take ε∗= S(ε0, ε0).

Exercises
We formulated 3H.1 for parametrizations in N, since this version is most directly
applicable.
However, there is a similar result for parametrizations in ù, which is
occasionally useful.
3H.4. Suppose Γ is ù-parametrized and closed under recursive substitutions. Then
we can associate with each space X a set GX ⊆ù × X in Γ which is universal for
Γ ↾X and so that the following property holds: for each space X of type 0 and each
Y there is a recursive function
SX×Y = S : ù × X →ù
so that
GX×Y(e, x, y) ⇐⇒GY S(e, x), y

.
Moreover, for any X, if R ⊆ù × X is in Γ, then we can ﬁnd some e∗∈ù so that
R(e∗, x) ⇐⇒GX(e∗, x).

3I. Eﬀective theory on arbitrary (perfect) Polish spaces

3I. Eﬀective theory on arbitrary (perfect) Polish spaces
We have developed the eﬀective theory for recursively presented Polish spaces,
partly because all concrete Polish spaces have natural recursive presentations, but also
because (quite obviously) the proofs depend on it. The results, however, apply easily
and in a natural way to all Polish spaces, in two diﬀerent ways.
First, notice the following classical version of Theorem 1G.4:
3I.1. Theorem. Every uncountable Polish space is Borel isomorphic with N.
Proof. By the Cantor-Bendixson Theorem 2A.1, every uncountable Polish space
M has a non-empty, perfect subset P, which is (easily) a perfect Polish space with the
induced metric, and hence Borel isomorphic with N, by 1G.4. This gives us a Borel
injection
f : N ֌ P ⊆M,
and in the opposite direction a Borel injection
h1 : P ֌ {α ∈N : α(0) = 0},
which can be extended to a Borel injection h : M ֌ N by assigning arbitrary
(distinct) values to the members of the countable, scattered part M \ P. Now the
proof of Theorem 1G.4 applies and yields a Borel isomorphism of M with N.
⊣
So every proposition which is preserved under Borel isomorphisms is true of all
uncountable Polish spaces exactly if it is true of N.
How about theorems whose very statement involves eﬀective notions and so are not
in any way respected by Borel isomorphisms? Consider, for example, Theorem 3E.7,
by which
any two (recursively presented) perfect Polish spaces are ∆1
1-isomorphic.
Is there an “eﬀective” version of this which applies to all perfect Polish spaces? The
obvious answer is to formulate and derive such results by relativizing the notions and
proofs of the eﬀective theory to some arbitrary ε ∈N, as follows.
Recall the deﬁnition on page 114 of the pointclass Σ0
1(ε) and the derived notions of
ε-recursive pointsets, points and partial functions.
3I.2. Relativization Principle. All the results we have proved so far and those we
will prove in the sequel remain true (and by the same proofs), if we replace in their
statements “recursive” by “ε-recursive”, for any ﬁxed ε.
It sounds dramatic, especially as it refers to the future, but it is really obvious: the
principle holds because we never use any properties of recursive partial functions on
ù other than those we have already established in this Chapter, and these are all true
of ε-recursive partial functions, for any ﬁxed ε.
We must be careful, of course, not to shift the parameter: the Hierarchy Theo-
rem 3F.7, for example, establishes the existence of Σ0
1 subsets of every X which are not
recursive, and its correct relativization is that, for every ε, there are subsets of X which
are Σ0
1(ε) but not ε-recursive—not that there is a Σ0
1 set which is not ε-recursive, for
any ε, which is clearly false. On the other hand, we can combine parameters, by 3E.15,
which we restate here in a form that applies directly to the discussion:
3I.3. Lemma. If ε1 ≤T ε2, then every ε1-recursive pointset, point or partial function
is also ε2-recursive. In particular, for any ε, α, every ε-recursive pointset, point or partial
function is also ⟨ε, α⟩-recursive.

142
3. Basic notions of the eﬀective theory
[3I.4
Since all the deﬁnitions of pointclasses we have given are based on the basic deﬁnition
of Σ0
1, they all relativize directly and naturally: e.g., we replace Σ1
1 by Σ1
1(ε), ∆1
1(z) by
∆1
1(ε, z), etc.—and the results relativize accordingly and they are proved by relativizing
the “absolute” proofs.
An ε-recursive presentation of a Polish space M is any enumeration of a dense set
{r0, r1, . . . } such that the relations
P(i, j, m, k) ⇐⇒d(ri, rj) ≤
m
k + 1,
Q(i, j, m, k) ⇐⇒d(ri, rj) <
m
k + 1
are both recursive in ε. It is clear that every Polish space has an ε-recursive presenta-
tion, taking ε to code the relations P and Q relative to any dense set {r0, r1, . . . }; and
so we can include any perfect Polish space M among the basic spaces of the theory, if
we relativize it to any ε such that M can be ε-recursively presented. One result we get
in this way is the following corollary of the relativization of 3E.7:
3I.4. Theorem. If M1, M2 are perfect Polish spaces with presentations which are
recursive in ε1 and ε2 respectively, then M1 and M2 are ∆1
1(⟨ε1, ε2⟩)-isomorphic.
The reader can test his understanding of relativization by giving a “detailed” proof
of this—i.e., by checking out all the places where one must replace recursive by ⟨ε1, ε2⟩-
recursive in the proof of 3E.7 to get 3I.4. The exercise will also reveal where the perfec-
tion assumption is used: it is, for example, essential in the proof of the crucial 3D.15.
Whether some—and how much—of the eﬀective theory can be developed if we allow
uncountable recursively presented Polish spaces (or discrete spaces other than ù with
its natural presentation) is an interesting problem, which we will not discuss her.
3J. Historical remarks
1The class of recursive functions on the integers was introduced and studied in
the mid-thirties in various ways and by several mathematicians, particularly Church,
Kleene, Turing, Post and (later) Markov. We will not attempt to trace its history
here since this is done in some detail in the classsical monograph on the subject
Kleene [1952a]. Our development in 3A follows very closely the approach of Kleene.
2The generalization of recursion theory to spaces of type 0 or 1 is (at least) implicit
in Kleene [1952a] and more explicit in Kleene [1952b]. Alternative approaches to this
theory were given later by Kleene [1959a] and Kreisel [1959].
3There were also several attempts to develop the theory of recursive functions on
the reals, of which the most direct and successful was Lacombe [1959]. The later paper
Lacombe [1959] is more in the spirit of what we are doing here, in fact it develops
recursion theory in a more general context. The speciﬁc deﬁnitions we gave in this
chapter are new and perhaps simpler than previous developments, but we have no
signiﬁcant new results here.
4The arithmetical pointclasses on ù were introduced in Kleene [1943] and later
(independently) in Mostowski [1946]. They were studied extensively in Kleene [1952a].
5Taking again ù as his basic space, Kleene [1955b] introduced and studied the ana-
lytical pointclasses. The main aim of that paper was the study of the hyperarithmetical
relations on ù which had been introduced independently (earlier) by Davis [1950]
and Mostowski [1951]. These coincide with the ∆1
1 relations, but the proof of this is

3J]
3J. Historical remarks
143
quite diﬃcult—it was ﬁrst given in Kleene [1955c]. We will postpone studying the
hyperarithmetical relations until Chapter 7.
6In his original development of the theory Kleene introduced speciﬁc parametriza-
tions for the arithmetical and analytical pointclasses which he proved to be “good”
in the sense of 3H.1. The fact that good parametrizations can be constructed given
arbitrary ù-parametrizations was discovered by several people independently perhaps
ﬁrst by Friedman [1971].
7As we mentioned in the introduction to this book, the similarities and “analogies”
between the eﬀective theory on ù developed (mostly) by Kleene and classical descrip-
tive set theory on R were noticed ﬁrst by Mostowski and Addison. The uniﬁed eﬀective
descriptive set theory which we are studying here is the end result of a long process
of generalization and abstraction which started with Addison [1954] and [1959a] and
involved the work of many people.


CHAPTER 4
STRUCTURE THEORY FOR POINTCLASSES
We are now ready to plunge into a systematic study of the structure of Π1
1 and Σ1
2.
In many ways, this chapter is a continuation of Chapter 2; here too we will establish
various interesting properties of Σ
e
1
1 and Σ
e
1
2 sets, in fact we will answer several natural
questions left open there. What is new and diﬀerent is that we will use systematically
the methods of the eﬀective theory which we developed in the preceding chapter.
It turns out that this infusion of ideas from recursion theory creates a more radical
change in the ﬂavor of the subject than one might think. It is not just the case of ob-
taining “ﬁner” results about the lightface pointclasses with a little more computation,
as we did in Chapter 3. Even when we prove theorems which are signiﬁcant only for
the boldface pointclasses, we will use recursion theory to great advantage.
The most important results of the chapter are uniformization theorems, particu-
larly the Novikov-Kondo-Addison Theorem 4E.4 and the ∆-Uniformization Crite-
rion 4D.4. The latter implies that in many special circumstances we can uniformize a
Borel set by a Borel set.
As in Chapter 2 we will formulate many of the results of this chapter in a general
setting, to ease extension to the higher projective pointclasses.
This will lead us
naturally to the axiomatic deﬁnition of a Spector pointclass, one of the key notions
of the subject. Speciﬁcally for uniformization results, the notion of a scale will also
prove very important.
Perhaps this is the most important chapter of this book, because it is the most
characteristic of out subject. One could say that Chapter 1 was mostly topology,
Chapter 2 was set theory and Chapter 3 was recursion theory; but this chapter would
be out of place in anything but a book in descriptive set theory.
4A. The basic representation theorem for Π1
1 sets
Most of the results of Chapter 2 depended directly on the fact that Σ
e
1
1 sets are
ℵ0-Suslin. Here we will ﬁrst formulate an eﬀective version of this fact and then reﬁne
it to a representation theorem for Π1
1 sets which is the key to the structure properties
of this pointclass.
Recall from 3D.8 (∗20.) that
α(n) = ⟨α(0), . . . , α(n −1)⟩.
This is a recursive function of α and n.

Moreover, if X is of type 0 or 1, then Q may be chosen to be recursive.

To prove (i), take l = 1 for simplicity of notation and suppose by 3C.5 that
P(x, α) ⇐⇒(∃u)(∃v){x ∈N(X, u) & α ∈N(N, v) & P∗(u, v)}
with P∗semirecursive, so there is a recursive R such that
P(x, α) ⇐⇒(∃u)(∃v)(∃n){x ∈N(X, u) & α ∈N(N, v) & R(u, v, n)}.
By 3B.5, there are recursive functions g, h such that

i = h(v, i)].

[(w)i = h(v, i)] & R(u, v, n)
	
and verify easily that
P(x, α) ⇐⇒(∃t)Q
 x, α(t)

.
If X is f type 0 or 1, then Q is recursive since {(x, u) : x ∈N(X, u)} is recursive
by 3C.3.

4A.3. The Basic RepresentationTheorem for Π1
1 (Lusin-Sierpinski, Kleene(1–11)).
A pointset P ⊆X is Π1
1 is and only if there is a ∆1
1 function f : X →N such that for all
x, f(x) ∈LO and
P(x) ⇐⇒f(x) ∈WO.
(∗)
In fact, if P is Π1
1, then we can choose f : X →N so that for all x, ≤f(x) is a
non-empty linear ordering, (∗) holds, and the relation
R(x, n, m) ⇐⇒f(x)(n) = m
is arithmetical; if in addition X is of type 0 or 1, then (∗) holds with a recursive f.
Similarly, P is Π
e
1
1 if an only if (∗) holds with a Borel f, or with a continuous f if X
is of type 0 or 1.
Proof. This is an eﬀective and improved version of 2D.2, the representation of
complements of κ-Suslin sets of irrationals in the form
P(α) ⇐⇒T(α) is wellfounded,
where T is a tree on ù × κ. We might as well give here a direct proof for subsets of an
arbitrary space X.
The last assertion clearly follows from the claims preceding it.

Assume then by 4A.1 that

.
For each x, put
T(x) = {(u0, . . . , ut−1) : ¬R(x, ⟨u0, . . . , ut−1⟩)}
so that T(x) is a tree on ù and clearly
P(x) ⇐⇒T(x) is wellfounded.
What we must do is replace T(x) by a linear ordering on ù which will be wellfounded
precisely when T(x) is.
Put
(v0, . . . , vs−1) >x (u0, . . . , ut−1) ⇐⇒(v0, . . . , vs−1), (u0, . . . , ut−1) ∈T(x)
& {v0 > u0 ∨[v0 = u0 & v1 > u1] ∨[v0 = u0 & v1 = u1 & v2 > u2]
∨· · · ∨[v0 = u0 & v1 = u1 & · · · & vs−1 = us−1 & s < t]}
where > on the right is the usual “greater than” in ù.
Itis immediate thatif(v0, . . . , vs−1), (u0, . . . , ut−1)are both in T(x)and (v0, . . . , vs−1)
is an initial segment of (u0, . . . , ut−1), then (v0, . . . , vs−1) >x (u0, . . . , ut−1); thus if
T(x) has an inﬁnite branch, then >x has an inﬁnite descending chain.
Assume now that >x has an inﬁnite descending chain, say
v0 >x v1 >x v2 >x · · · ,
where
vi = (vi
0, vi
1, . . . , vi
si−1),
and consider the following array:
v0 = (v0

v1 = (v1
0, v1

s1−1)
· · ·
· · ·
vi = (vi
0, vi
1, . . . . . . , vi
si−1)
· · ·
· · ·
The deﬁnition of >x implies immediately that
v0
0 ≥v1
0 ≥v2
0 ≥· · · ,
i.e., the ﬁrst column is a nonincreasing sequence of integers. Hence after a while they
all are the same, say
vi
0 = k0
for i ≥i0.
Now the second column is nonincreasing below level i0, so that for some i1, k1
vi
1 = k1
for i ≥i1.
Proceeding in the same way we ﬁnd an inﬁnite sequence
k0, k1, . . .

and notice that ≤x is always a linear ordering, it is not empty (because the code 1 of
the empty sequence is in its ﬁeld), and
P(x) ⇐⇒≤x is a wellordering.
Moreover, the relation
P(x, u, v) ⇐⇒u ≤x v
is easily arithmetical for arbitrary X and recursive if X is of type 0 or 1.
The proof is completed by taking
f(x)(n) =

⊣
The linear ordering ≤x which we used in this proof is variously known in the
literature as the Lusin-Sierpinski or the Kleene-Brouwer ordering.(9,10) The (technical)
observation that ≤f(x) is always a non-empty linear ordering insures that if P(x), then
for all n,
| ≤f(x)↾n| < | ≤f(x) | = supremum{| ≤f(x)↾n| + 1 : n ≤f(x) n};
(*)
this holds by deﬁnition if n ≤f(x) n and trivially if n is not in the ﬁeld of ≤f(x), since
in that case | ≤f(x)↾n| = 0, while | ≤f(x) | > 0. This is used in some places to simplify
formulas.
Let us prove here just one very useful corollary of this basic result. Put
ùCK
1
= supremum{|α| : α ∈WO and α is recursive}.
One may think of ùCK
1
as an “eﬀective analog” of the least uncountable ordinal ℵ1;
ùCK
1
is the least ordinal which cannot be realized by a recursive wellordering with ﬁeld
in ù.(6)

1 if and only if
supremum{|f(x)| : P(x)} < ùCK

Similarly, suppose
P(x) ⇐⇒f(x) ∈WO

supremum{|f(x)| : P(x)} < ℵ1.

4. Structure theory for pointclasses
[4A.5
Proof. Assume ﬁrst that for all x, if P(x) then |f(x)| ≤|α|, where α ∈WO an α
is recursive. By 4A.2 then,
P(x) ⇐⇒f(x) ≤Σ α,
so P is Σ1
1 and since it is evidently Π1
1, it is ∆1
1.
Conversely, suppose supremum{|f(x)| : P(x)} ≥ùCK
1
. Let Q ⊆ù be any Π1
1
relation on ù, so by the basic representation theorem 4A.3 there is a recursive g : ù →
N and
Q(n) ⇐⇒g(n) ∈WO.
Notice that for every n, g(n) is a recursive irrational by (iv) of 3D.7. Hence
Q(n) ⇐⇒g(n) ∈WO & |g(n)| < ùCK
1
⇐⇒(∃x){P(x) & g(n) ≤Σ f(x)}
which implies that if P is Σ1
1, then so is Q. But Q was arbitrary Π1
1 on ù and need not
be Σ1
1, so P is not Σ1
1.
Proof of the boldface result is a bit simpler.

1 and
by 4A.3 choose a recursive f such that

Now each f(n) is a recursive irrational, so the assumption above implies
P(n) ⇐⇒f(n) ∈WO & |f(n)| ≤|â|
which via 4A.2 shows P to be ∆1

A ⊆N and a recursive ð : N →X which is injective on A and such that ð[A] = {x0};
thus A = {α0} is also a singleton, and ð(α0) = x0, so x0 is recursive in α0 by (iv)

4B. The prewellordering property(12,13)
The basic representation theorem implies easily the so-called prewellordering prop-
erty for Π1
1, which in turn implies directly many of the nice structural properties of this
pointclass. This property can be established for Σ1
2 and many other pointclasses more
complicated than Π1
1, so it is worth studying its consequences in a general setting.
Recall from 2B that a norm on a set P is any function
ϕ : P →Ordinals
taking P into the ordinals. There is a simple correspondence between norms and
prewellorderings on P established in 2G.8, where with each ϕ we associate the pre-
wellordering ≤ϕ on P,
x ≤ϕ y ⇐⇒ϕ(x) ≤ϕ(y).
Conversely, if ≺is a prewellordering on P, then ≺= ≤ϕ for some norm ϕ; moreover,
ϕ is uniquely determined if we insist that it be regular, i.e., that ϕ maps P onto some
ordinal ë.
Let us call two norms ϕ and ø on P equivalent if ≤ϕ = ≤ø, i.e.,
ϕ(x) ≤ϕ(y) ⇐⇒ø(x) ≤ø(y).
Clearly, every norm is equivalent to a unique regular norm.

4B.2]
4B. The prewellordering property
153
There are many trivial norms on a set, e.g., the constant 0 function, but the concept
becomes nontrivial if we impose deﬁnability conditions on a norm in the following
way.
Let Γ be a pointclass, ϕ : P →ë a norm on some pointset P. We call ϕ a Γ-norm
if there exist relations ≤ϕ
Γ, ≤ϕ
˘Γ in Γ and ¬Γ respectively such that for every y,
P(y) =⇒(∀x){[P(x) & ϕ(x) ≤ϕ(y)] ⇐⇒x ≤ϕ
Γ y ⇐⇒x ≤ϕ
˘Γ y}.
(∗)
It is important for the applications that the deﬁnition of Γ-norm be precisely that
given by (∗). Notice that if Γ is adequate and P ∈Γ, then (∗) is stronger than simply
requiring that the associated prewellordering ≤ϕ be in Γ but weaker than insisting that
≤ϕ be in Γ ∩¬Γ.
In addition to the prewellordering ≤ϕ, there are two other relations that are naturally
associated with a norm ϕ. Put
x ≤∗
ϕ y ⇐⇒P(x) & [¬P(y) ∨ϕ(x) ≤ϕ(y)],
x <∗
ϕ y ⇐⇒P(x) & [¬P(y) ∨ϕ(x) < ϕ(y)].
The meaning of these relations becomes clear if we extend the norm ϕ on P ⊆X to
all of X by
ϕ(x) = ∞,
if ¬P(x),
where ∞is assumed larger than all the ordinals. Then obviously, with this extended ϕ,
x ≤∗
ϕ y ⇐⇒P(x) & ϕ(x) ≤ϕ(y),
x <∗
ϕ y ⇐⇒P(x) & ϕ(x) < ϕ(y).
4B.1. Theorem. Let Γ be an adequate pointclass and let ϕ be a norm on some P in
Γ; then ϕ is a Γ-norm if and only if both ≤∗
ϕ and <∗
ϕ are in Γ.
Proof. If ≤∗
ϕ, <∗
ϕ are in Γ, we can take
x ≤ϕ
Γ y ⇐⇒x ≤∗
ϕ y,
x ≤ϕ
˘Γ y ⇐⇒¬(y <∗
ϕ x),
and verify easily that they prove ϕ to be a Γ-norm. On the other hand, given such
relations ≤ϕ
Γ, ≤ϕ
˘Γ, notice that
x ≤∗
ϕ y ⇐⇒P(x) & [x ≤ϕ
Γ y ∨¬y ≤ϕ
˘Γ x],
x <∗
ϕ y ⇐⇒P(x) & ¬y ≤ϕ
˘Γ x,
so that both ≤∗
ϕ and <∗
ϕ are in Γ.

4B.3. Theorem (Novikov, Moschovakis(12,13)). If Γ is adequate, P ∈Γ, P ⊆X ×N

Hence, if Γ is adequate closed under ∀N and normed, then ∃N Γ is normed, and in
particular, Σ1
2 and Σ
e
1
2 are normed.
Proof. It is enough to establish the ﬁrst assertion. Assume that
Q(x) ⇐⇒(∃α)P(x, α)
with P in Γ, let ϕ be a Γ-norm on P and deﬁne ø on Q by
ø(x) = inﬁmum{ϕ(x, α) : P(x, α)}.
Proof that ø is an ∃N ∀N Γ-norm is immediate from the equivalences
x ≤∗
ø y ⇐⇒(∃α)(∀â)[(x, α) ≤∗
ϕ (y, â)],
x <∗
ø y ⇐⇒(∃α)(∀â)[(x, α) <∗
ϕ (y, â)].
⊣
This result is typical of the kind of abstract setting in which the notion of a Γ-norm
proves useful. There will be several opportunities for applying 4B.3 in its full generality.
We will study many consequences of the prewellordering property in the next two
sections. Here we concentrate on just a few facts which are simple, useful and indicative
of the power of this hypothesis about a pointclass.
Recall the deﬁnition of a uniformizing set P∗⊆P ⊆X × Y in Section 1C, Fig-
ure 1C.1.
4B.4. The Easy Uniformization Theorem (Kreisel [1962]). Suppose Γ is an ade-
quate pointclass, Y is a space of type 0, P ⊆X × Y is in Γ and P admits a Γ-norm.
Then P can be uniformized by some P∗in ∀ùΓ.
In particular, if Γ is adequate, normed and closed under ∀ù, then every P ⊆X × Y in
Γ with Y of type 0 can be uniformized by some P∗in Γ.
Proof. It is obviously enough to prove the result with Y = ù. Assume then that
P ⊆X × ù is in Γ, let ϕ be a Γ-norm on P and put
P∗(x, n) ⇐⇒P(x, n) & (∀m)[(x, n) ≤∗
ϕ (x, m)]
& (∀m)[(x, n) <∗
ϕ (x, m) ∨n ≤m],
or in other words
P∗(x, n) ⇐⇒P(x, n) & ϕ(x, n) = inﬁmum{ϕ(x, m) : P(x, m)}
& n = inﬁmum{m : P(x, m) & ϕ(x, m) = ϕ(x, n)}.
Clearly P∗is in ∀ùΓ and
P∗(x, n) & P∗(x, n′) =⇒P(x, n) & P(x, n′)
& ϕ(x, n) = ϕ(x, n′) & n ≤n′ & n′ ≤n =⇒n = n′,
so P∗is the graph of a function. If (∃n)P(x, n), let
î = inﬁmum{ϕ(x, n) : P(x, n)},
n = inﬁmum{m : P(x, m) & ϕ(x, m) = î},
and verify easily that P∗(x, n). Thus P∗uniformizes P.

The problem of uniformizing subsets X × Y for arbitrary product spaces Y is much
harder and cannot be settled using only the prewellordering property. We will deal
with it in 4E.
Theorem 4B.4 is most often used in the form of the following easy corollary.

∆= Γ ∩¬Γ and
(∀x ∈A)(∃y)P(x, y).
Then there exists a ∆-recursive function f : X →Y such that

Proof. Put
Q(x, y) ⇐⇒x /∈A ∨[x ∈A & P(x, y)]
and choose Q∗⊆Q by 4B.4 which is in Γ and uniformizes Q. Clearly Q∗is the
graph of a function f : X →Y and (∀x ∈A)P


. Since Y is of type 0, f is
Γ-recursive by 3D.2; now f is ∆-recursive since
f(x) ̸= y ⇐⇒(∃y′)[f(x) = y′ & y′ ̸= y].

It follows from the results of this section that the Kleene pointclasses which are

The circle around Σ0

We have not included here Σ1

clear at this point which of Σ1

3 is normed, if any.
Many of the results in this section have uniform versions which are easy to establish
using the methods of 3H. We put down one theorem of this type as an example.
4B.14. If Γ is ù-parametrized, adequate and has the reduction property, then Γ has
the uniform reduction property, i.e., for each X, there are recursive functions u1(α, â),
u2(α, â) such that whenever α, â code subsets P, Q of X respectively in Γ
e
, then
u1(α, â), u2(α, â) code sets P∗, Q∗respectively which reduce the pair P, Q.
Hint. All codings are relative to a good parametrization of course, so the hypothesis
(for example) means that
P(x) ⇐⇒G(α, x),
Q(x) ⇐⇒G(â, x)
with G a good universal set.
Deﬁne
U1(α, â, x) ⇐⇒G(α, x),
U2(α, â, x) ⇐⇒G(â, x),
so that both U1 and U2 are in Γ and let U ∗
1 , U ∗

then recursive irrationals ε1, ε2 so that

4C. Spector pointclasses(14–16)
The consequences of the prewellordering property which we proved in 4B depended
on several side conditions on a pointclass Γ, e.g., closure under various operations or
parametrization. Here we will isolate the most commonly used hypotheses into the
basic notion of a Spector pointclass. The simplest Spector pointclasses are Π1
1 and
Σ1
2—in fact Π1
1 is the least Spector pointclass.
A Spector pointclass is a collection of pointsets Γ which satisﬁes the following
conditions:
(1) Γ is a Σ-pointclass with the substitution property and closed under ∀ù.
(2) Γ is ù-parametrized.
(3) Γ is normed.
Recall that (1) implies Σ0
1 ⊆Γ and Γ is closed under & , ∨, ∃≤and ∃ù, and by 3G.1,
Γ is also adequate.
All the Kleene pointclasses Σ1
n, Π1
n satisfy (1) and (2), so to prove that one of these is
a Spector pointclass we need only verify the prewellordering property. It is also trivial
to check that each relativization Γ(z) of a Spector pointclass Γ is a Spector pointclass,
see 4C.4. Thus Π1
1, Σ1
2, Π1
1(z), Σ1
2(z) are Spector pointclasses—they are the only ones
we know at this time.
In Chapters 5 and 6 we will prove using strong set theoretic hypotheses that some
of the higher Kleene pointclasses are also normed and in Chapters 6 and 7 we will
introduce many more examples of Spector pointclasses.
Here we concentrate on
consequences of (1)–(3) above which give us new results about Π1
1 and Σ1
2.
First let us prove a strong closure property of Spector pointclasses which implies
that every one of them contains every Π1
1 relation.
Suppose Q(x, w) is given and we deﬁne P(x, w) by
P(x, w) ⇐⇒(∀α)(∃t)Q
 x, w ∗α(t)

,
(∗)
where w ∗v codes the concatenation of the sequences coded by w and v, if Seq(w),
Seq(v), see (∗18) of 3A.6. For each countable ordinal î, deﬁne the set Pî ⊆X × ù
by the recursion
Pî(x, w) ⇐⇒Q(x, w) ∨(∀s)(∃ç < î)Pç(x, w ∗⟨s⟩).
(∗∗)
It is easy to verify by induction on î, that
Pî(x, w) =⇒P(x, w).
We claim that, in addition,
(∀î)¬Pî(x, w) =⇒¬Q(x, w) & (∃s)(∀î)¬Pî(x, w ∗⟨s⟩);
(∗∗∗)
because if (∀î)¬Pî(x, w) but (towards a contradiction) for every s there exists some
îs such that Pîs(x, w ∗⟨s⟩) and we choose κ > îs for every s, then ¬Pκ(x, w) by
the hypothesis, which implies that for some s and for all ç < κ, ¬Pç(x, w ∗⟨s⟩),
contradicting the choice of κ. Now, from (∗∗∗), there is some s = s0 such that for
all î, ¬Pî(x, w ∗⟨s0⟩), so again ¬Q(x, w ∗⟨s0⟩) and now for some s = s1 and all î,

4C.2]
4C. Spector pointclasses
159
¬Pî(x, w∗⟨s0, s1⟩), etc., and ﬁnally we have (∀t)¬Q
 x, w∗α(t)

, with α = (s0, s1, . . . ),
i.e., ¬P(x, w). Thus
P = S
î Pî.
Now deﬁne a norm
ϕ : P →Ordinals
by
ϕ(x, w) = least î such that Pî(x, w);
it is immediate from (∗∗) that P satisﬁes the equivalence
P(x, w) ⇐⇒Q(x, w) ∨(∀s)[(x, w ∗⟨s⟩) <∗
ϕ (x, w)].
It is perhaps a bit surprising that this equivalence completely determines P.
4C.1. Lemma. Suppose Q(x, w), P(x, w) are given and P admits a norm ϕ such that
P(x, w) ⇐⇒Q(x, w) ∨(∀s)[(x, w ∗⟨s⟩) <∗
ϕ (x, w)];
then
P(x, w) ⇐⇒(∀α)(∃t)Q
 x, w ∗α(t)

.
Proof. First we prove by induction on ϕ(x, w) that
P(x, w) =⇒(∀α)(∃t)Q
 x, w ∗α(t)

.
Assuming this for all (x, u) ∈P with ϕ(x, u) < ϕ(x, w) and supposing that P(x, w)
holds, we have by the hypothesis
Q(x, w) ∨(∀s)[(x, w ∗⟨s⟩) <∗
ϕ (x, w)].
If Q(x, w) holds, then easily (∀α)Q
 x, w ∗α(0)

since w ∗α(0) = w. Otherwise, we
have
(∀s)[(x, w ∗⟨s⟩) <∗
ϕ (x, w)],
so that for each s, P(x, w ∗⟨s⟩) and ϕ(x, w ∗⟨s⟩) < ϕ(x, w).
By the induction
hypothesis then,
(∀s)(∀α)(∃t)Q
 x, w ∗⟨s⟩∗α(t)

from which (∀α)(∃t)Q
 x, w ∗α(t)

follows immediately.
Conversely, if we assume ¬P(x, w), then ¬Q(x, w) and there exists some s = s0
such that ¬(x, w ∗⟨s0⟩) <∗
ϕ (x, w). This means ¬P(x, w ∗⟨s0⟩), since P(x, w ∗⟨s0⟩)
and ¬P(x, w) implies (x, w ∗⟨s0⟩) <∗
ϕ (x, w). Again, ¬Q(x, w ∗⟨s0⟩) and for some
s = s1, ¬(x, w ∗⟨s0, s1⟩) <∗
ϕ (x, w ∗⟨s0⟩) etc., so we get some α = (s0, s1, . . . ) such
that (∀t)¬Q
 x, w ∗α(t)

.
⊣
There is a bit of trickery in this proof which will not become completely clear until
we look carefully at inductive deﬁnability in Chapter 7. For now we can simply view
this lemma as a tool for establishing the next very useful result.
4C.2. Theorem (Moschovakis(15)). Let Γ be a Spector pointclass, suppose Q ⊆X ×
ù is in Γ and P is deﬁned by
P(x) ⇐⇒(∀α)(∃t)Q
 x, α(t)

;
then P is in Γ.
In particular, Π1
1 is the smallest Spector pointclass and Σ1
2 is the smallest Spector
pointclass closed under ∃N .

160
4. Structure theory for pointclasses
[4C.3
Proof. The second assertion follows immediately from the ﬁrst by (ii) of 4A.1.
To prove the ﬁrst assertion using the lemma, it is enough to ﬁnd some R∗⊆X × ù
in Γ which admits some norm ϕ so that
R∗(x, w) ⇐⇒Q(x, w) ∨(∀s)[(x, w ∗⟨s⟩) <∗
ϕ (x, w)],
since we then have
P(x) ⇐⇒R∗(x, 1).
Here is where we will use Kleene’s Recursion Theorem for relations, 3H.3.
Let G ⊆N × X × ù be a good universal set in Γ for Γ
e
, let ø : G →Ordinals be a
Γ-norm on G and deﬁne
R(α, x, w) ⇐⇒Q(x, w) ∨(∀s)[(α, x, w ∗⟨s⟩) <∗
ø (α, x, w)].
Now R is in Γ, so by 3H.3 there is a ﬁxed recursive ε∗so that
R(ε∗, x, w) ⇐⇒G(ε∗, x, w).
Put
R∗(x, w) ⇐⇒R(ε∗, x, w)
and on R∗put the norm
ϕ(x, w) = ø(ε∗, x, w).
Computing,
R∗(x, w) ⇐⇒R(ε∗, x, w)
⇐⇒Q(x, w) ∨(∀s)[(ε∗, x, w ∗⟨s⟩) <∗
ø (ε∗, x, w)]
⇐⇒Q(x, w) ∨(∀s)[(x, w ∗⟨s⟩) <∗
ϕ (x, w)]
so that R∗has the required property.
⊣
This theorem is interesting partly because it gives an intrinsic structural characteri-
zation of Π1
1. Of course, Π1
1 can be easily characterized by its closure properties, e.g.,
it is the smallest Σ-pointclass closed under ∀ù and ∀N . But nothing very deep can
be proved in general about Σ-pointclasses closed under ∀ù and ∀N . We will see that
Spector pointclasses have a rich structure theory, much of it giving new results even
when we specialize it to Π1
1.
There is another practical corollary of 4C.2 which we will list together with some
simple properties of total functions recursive in a Spector pointclass.
4C.3. Theorem. Let Γ be a Spector pointclass, suppose f : X →Y is total and
Γ-recursive; then f is ∆-recursive, Graph(f) = {(x, y) : f(x) = y} is in ∆and for
every x,
f(x) ∈∆(x) = Γ(x) ∩¬Γ(x),
i.e., f(x) is a ∆(x)-recursive point.
Moreover, every ∆1
1 function is Γ-recursive, so in particular, Γ is closed under substitu-
tion of ∆1
1 functions.
Proof. The ﬁrst assertion is easy and uses only the fact that Γ is a Σ-pointclass
closed under ∀ù. Thus {(y, s) : y /∈Ns} is in Γ since it is Π0
1 and Γ contains all Π0
1
sets, hence {(x, s) : f(x) /∈Ns} is in Γ by closure under substitution of Γ-recursive
functions; thus f is ∆-recursive. From this follows trivially that f(x) ∈∆(x). As for
the graph,
f(x) = y ⇐⇒(∀s)[y ∈Ns =⇒f(x) ∈Ns]
⇐⇒(∀s)[f(x) ∈Ns =⇒y ∈Ns].

4C.7]
4C. Spector pointclasses
161
Now if f : X →Y is ∆1
1, then {(x, s) : f(x) ∈Ns} is ∆1
1, hence in Γ by 4C.2, hence
f is Γ-recursive.

If ϕ : P ։ ë is a regular norm, we call ë the length of ϕ,

The length |ϕ| of an arbitrary norm is (by deﬁnition) the length of the unique regular

4. Structure theory for pointclasses
[4C.8
This result is more useful if we can get an estimate on the length |ϕ| of a Γ-norm.
Given a pointclass Γ (which need not be a Spector pointclass), put
ä = supremum{| < | : < is a prewellordering of ù, < in ∆},
ä
e
= supremum{| < | : < is a prewellordering of N, < in ∆
e
}.
Clearly, ä is a countable ordinal, but ä
e
may well be uncountable—the only obvious
bound is
ä
e
< (2ℵ0)+ = least cardinal > 2ℵ0.
4C.8. Let Γ be an adequate pointclass closed under ∃ù, ∀ù. Prove that
ä = supremum{| ≤| : ≤is a wellordering on ù, < in ∆},
ä is a limit ordinal and for every Γ-norm ϕ on a pointset P of type 0 in Γ, |ϕ| ≤ä.
4C.9. Prove that if Γ is an adequate pointclass, then for every Γ
e
-norm ϕ on a
pointset P in Γ
e

e
.
If Γ is a Spector pointclass, then ä
e
is an ordinal of coﬁnality > ù and every pointset

e
is the union of ä
e
sets in ∆
e

Hint. An ordinal ë has coﬁnality > ù if for every increasing sequence î0 < î1 <
· · · < ë, limn în < ë. This follows here from closure of ∆
e
under Wù.
⊣
This is obviously a “soft” version of part of 2F.2, with a very diﬀerent proof. To get
“hard” corollaries of this exercise we must establish a construction principle for the
speciﬁc ∆
e
and also get an estimate of the size of ä
e
. Both of these often turn out to be
very hard.
The traditional notation for ä and ä
e
when Γ is Σ1
n (or Π1
n), is ä1
n and ä
e
1
n. Similarly,
for the relativized class Σ1
n(z) (or Π1
n(z)), its ordinal is ä1
n(z). (It is trivial to establish
that the boldface class corresponding to Σ1
n(z) is Σ
e
1
n, so the boldface ordinal of Σ1
n(z)
is again ä
e
1
n.)
From the Kunen-Martin Theorem 2G.2 we know that
ä
e

1 = ℵ1,
ä
e

2 ≤ℵ2.
This is about all that can be proved about these ordinals in classical set theory, except

Hint. Let ë = |ϕ| and assume ﬁrst that ë < ℵ1. Now
P = S
î<ë Pî
and each Pî is Borel by 4C.7, so P is a countable union of Borel sets and hence Borel.
Conversely, if P is Borel, then the prewellordering
x ≤y ⇐⇒P(x) & P(y) & ϕ(x) ≤ϕ(y)
of length ë is easily Borel and hence ë < ℵ1.

4D. The parametrization theorem for ∆∩X
Most of the results in 4C follow quite directly from the deﬁnitions and depend
on only few of the axioms for a Spector pointclass. Here we will consider somewhat
deeper propositions whose proofs make essential use of the full set of axioms, including
ù-parametrization.
Recall that a partial function
f : X ⇀Y
is Γ-recursive if Domain(f) is in Γ and f is Γ-recursive on its domain; if Γ is closed
under & , this amounts to saying that the relation
Gf(x, s) ⇐⇒f(x)↓& f(x) ∈Ns
is in Γ. These partial functions are very useful when Γ is a Spector pointclass. We
summarize some of their properties in the next result.
4D.1. Theorem. Let Γ be a Spector pointclass, let f : X ⇀Y be a Γ-recursive
partial function.
(i) The relations
P(x) ⇐⇒f(x)↓,
Q(x, s) ⇐⇒f(x)↓& f(x) /∈Ns,
R(x, y) ⇐⇒f(x) = y,
⇐⇒f(x)↓& f(x) = y,
S(x, y) ⇐⇒f(x)↓& f(x) ̸= y,
are all in Γ.
(ii) If Q ⊆Y is in Γ and
R(x) ⇐⇒f(x)↓& Q
 f(x)

then R is in Γ.
(iii) For each x ∈X, if f(x)↓, then f(x) ∈∆(x), i.e., f(x) is ∆(x)-recursive.

4. Structure theory for pointclasses
[4D.2
Proof. (i) The set {(y, s) : y /∈Ns} is Π0
1 and hence in Γ and the partial function
(x, s) 7→
 f(x), s

is easily Γ-recursive, so by the substitution property there is some
Q∗(x, s) in Γ such that
f(x)↓=⇒[Q∗(x, s) ⇐⇒f(x) /∈Ns];
thus
f(x)↓& f(x) /∈Ns ⇐⇒f(x)↓& Q∗(x, s)
and this is in Γ.
The other claims are easier:
f(x) = y ⇐⇒(∀s){y ∈Ns =⇒[f(x)↓& f(x) ∈Ns]},
f(x)↓& f(x) ̸= y ⇐⇒(∃s){[f(x)↓& f(x) ∈Ns] & y /∈Ns}.
(ii) Given Q ⊆Y in Γ, choose Q∗⊆X in Γ by the substitution property so that
f(x)↓=⇒

Q∗(x) ⇐⇒Q
 f(x)

and notice that
R(x) ⇐⇒f(x)↓& Q∗(x).
(iii) Use 3G.5.
⊣
We have been using and will continue to use the handy abbreviation
y ∈∆⇐⇒y is ∆-recursive
⇐⇒U(y) is in ∆,
and similarly for ∆(x). It is also convenient for any pointclass Λ to put
Λ ∩X = {x ∈X : x is Λ-recursive}.
For example Σ0
1 ∩R = ∆0
1 ∩R = the set of recursive real numbers.
Using partial functions we can formulate simply an easy to prove but very powerful
parametrization theorem for the points in a Spector pointclass.
4D.2. The Parametrization Theorem for the Points in ∆, ∆(x)(17). Let Γ be a
Spector pointclass. For each product space Y, there is a Γ-recursive partial function
d : ù ⇀Y
such that for every y ∈Y,
y ∈∆⇐⇒
for some i, d(i)↓& d(i) = y.
Similarly, for any X, Y there is a Γ-recursive partial function
d : ù × X ⇀Y
such that for all x, y,
y ∈∆(x) ⇐⇒for some i, d(i, x)↓& d(i, x) = y.
Proof. Take ﬁrst the case Y = N. We prove the second assertion, the ﬁrst being
simpler.
Choose a set G ⊆ù × X × ù × ù which is universal for Γ ↾(X × ù × ù) and let
G∗⊆G be in Γ and uniformize G by the Easy Uniformization Theorem 4B.4. Here
we are thinking of G as a subset of (ù × X × ù) × ù, i.e., we uniformize only on the
last variable. Now put
d(i, x)↓⇐⇒(∀n)(∃m)G∗(i, x, n, m)

4D.4]
4D. The parametrization theorem for ∆∩X
167
and if d(i, x)↓, let
d(i, x) = α
where for all n, m
α(n) = m ⇐⇒G∗(i, x, n, m).
We omit the trivial computation which establishes that d is in Γ. From this it follows
that each d(i, x) is in ∆(x) by 4D.1. Conversely, if α ∈∆(x), choose i so that
α(n) = m ⇐⇒G(i, x, n, m)
so that
α(n) = m ⇐⇒G∗(i, x, n, m)
and hence d(i, x)↓& d(i, x) = α.
If Y is of type 0, the result is trivial. Otherwise, there is a ∆1
1 bijection
ð : N ֌
→Y
with ∆1
1 inverse ð−1 by 3E.7, so let d as above parametrize the ∆(x) points in N and
deﬁne d∗: ù × X →Y by
d∗(i, x) = ð
 d(i, x)

;
clearly
d∗(i, x)↓& d∗(i, x) ∈Ns ⇐⇒d(i, x)↓& ð
 d(i, x)

∈Ns
so d∗is Γ-recursive. In particular, each d∗(i, x) is in ∆(i, x) = ∆(x). Conversely, if y
is in ∆(x), then α = ð−1(y) is in ∆(x) since ð−1 is ∆1
1 and hence Γ-recursive, hence
α = d(i, x) for some i and y = ð(α) = d∗(i, x).
⊣
There are many interesting corollaries of this theorem and we will leave most of
them for the exercises. Two deserve special billing.
4D.3. The Theorem on Restricted Quantiﬁcation (Kleene [1959b](18)). Let Γ
be a Spector pointclass, assume that Q ⊆X × Y is in Γ and put
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃y ∈∆)Q(x, y).
Then P is in Γ.
Similarly, if Q ⊆X × Z × Y is in Γ and
P(x, z) ⇐⇒
 ∃y ∈∆(z)

Q(x, z, y)
then P is in Γ.
Proof. Taking the second case,
P(x, z) ⇐⇒(∃i)

d(i, z)↓& Q
 x, z, d(i, z)
	
,
so P is in Γ by (ii) of 4D.1.
⊣
The next result gives a very powerful method for uniformizing Borel sets by Borel
sets in the special circumstances when this is possible.
4D.4. The ∆-Uniformization Criterion(24). Let Γ be a Spector pointclass closed
under ∀N , let P ⊆X × Y be in ∆and assume that each section Px = {y : P(x, y)} is
either ∅or contains some points in ∆(x) ∩Y, i.e.,
(∃y)P(x, y) ⇐⇒
 ∃y ∈∆(x)

P(x, y).
(∗)
Then the projection ∃YP is in ∆and P can be uniformized by some P∗in ∆.
Conversely, if P ⊆X × Y is in ∆and can be uniformized by some P∗in ∆, then each
non-empty section Px has some point in ∆(x).

4. Structure theory for pointclasses
[4D.5
Proof. Assume (∗) and let Q = ∃YP, i.e.,
Q(x) ⇐⇒(∃y)P(x, y)
⇐⇒
 ∃y ∈∆(x)

P(x, y).
Clearly Q is in ∆by closure of ¬Γ under ∃N and 4D.3.
Now put
R(x, i) ⇐⇒P
 x, d(i, x)

where d parametrizes ∆(x)∩Y by 4D.2. By the ∆-Selection Principle 4B.5, since (∀x ∈
Q)(∃i)R(x, i), there must be some g : X →ù in ∆such that (∀x ∈Q)R
 x, g(x)

.
Put
P∗(x, y) ⇐⇒Q(x) & d
 g(x), x

= y.
It is immediate that P∗uniformizes P and that it is in ∆follows by 4D.1, since
P∗(x, y) ⇐⇒Q(x) & (∃i)[d(i, x)↓& d(i, x) = y & g(x) = i],
¬P∗(x, y) ⇐⇒¬Q(x) ∨(∃i)[d(i, x)↓& d(i, x) ̸= y & g(x) = i].
For the converse, suppose P∗⊆P is in ∆and uniformizes P and assume that
(∃y)P(x, y); then there is a unique y∗such that P∗(x, y∗) and
y∗∈Ns ⇐⇒(∃y)[P∗(x, y) & y ∈Ns]
⇐⇒(∀y)[P∗(x, y) =⇒y ∈Ns],
so y∗∈∆(x).

We leave the application of this result for the exercises of this and the next two
sections.

Taking Γ = Π1

∆
e
and there is a ∆
e
-measurable function g : Y →X which agrees with the inverse f−1
on f[P].
Hint. If P is in ∆
e
, then P is in Γ(ε0) and in ¬Γ(ε1) for some ε0, ε1 in N, so easily
P is in ∆(ε) for some ε, say with (ε)0 = ε0, (ε)1 = ε1. Similarly, if f is ∆
e
-measurable,
then f is ∆(ε′)-recursive for any ε′ such that {(x, s) : f(x) ∈Ns} is in ∆(ε′). Thus
we can ﬁnd some ε∗such that P is in ∆(ε∗) and f is ∆(ε∗)-recursive and apply 4D.7
to Γ∗= Γ(ε∗); it follows that f[P] is in ∆(ε∗) ⊆∆

4. Structure theory for pointclasses

Before using 4D.4 to establish some interesting uniformization results, we point out
that not every Borel set can be uniformized by a Borel set.
First a lemma which is interesting in its own right.
4D.10. Prove that there is a Π0
1 set A ⊆N, such that A ̸= ∅but A has no ∆1
1-
recursive member; similarly, for each x, there is a Π0
1(x) set A ⊆N, A ̸= ∅, such that
A has no ∆1
1(x)-recursive member. (Kleene [1955c].(19,20))
Infer that not every Π0
1 set A ⊆N is a recursive image of N.
Hint. Towards a contradiction, assume that every non-empty Π0
1 set has a member
in ∆1
1 and let P(n) be a Σ1
1 relation on ù which is not Π1
1. There is a Π0
1 set Q(n, α)
such that
P(n) ⇐⇒(∃α)Q(n, α)
and by our assumption, we then have
P(n) ⇐⇒(∃α ∈∆1
1)Q(n, α)
which implies that P is in Π1
1 by 4D.3.
If A = f[N] with a recursive f, then A would have recursive members, namely any
f(α) with recursive α.
⊣
4D.11. Prove that there is a Π0
1 set P ⊆N × N which cannot be uniformized by
any Σ
e
1
1 set.(19,20)
Hint. Assume the contrary and let G(n, ε, α) be a universal Π0
1 subset of ù×N ×N.
Since ù × N is recursively homeomorphic with N, the assumption implies that G can
be uniformized by some Σ
e
1
1 set G∗⊆G, say G∗is Σ1
1(ε∗) for a ﬁxed ε∗. Now every
Π0
1(ε∗) set A ⊆N is of the form
A = {α : G(n, ε∗, α)}
with a ﬁxed n; if A ̸= ∅, then (∃α)G(n, ε∗, α), so A contains the unique α∗such that
G∗(n, ε∗, α∗). But this α∗is in ∆1
1(ε∗), since
α∗(t) = w ⇐⇒(∃α)[G∗(n, ε∗, α) & α(t) = w]
⇐⇒(∀α)[G∗(n, ε∗, α) =⇒α(t) = w],
contradicting 4D.10.

Nevertheless, there are many special circumstances in which Borel sets can be uni-

assume that for each x, the section Px has at least one isolated point—e.g., it may be
that each Px is ﬁnite, or countable and closed. Prove that P can be uniformized by
some P∗in ∆. Infer the same result for P in ∆
e
, with P∗in ∆
e
.
Hint. If y is isolated in Px, then for some s, Px ∩Ns = {y}, so that the singleton
{y} is in ∆(x) and y is easily ∆(x)-recursive. For the second assertion recall that each
P in ∆

In 4F we will improve this result substantially by showing that it is enough to assume

j ∈J ⇐⇒(∃α)[α ∈D & c(α) = j]

The deﬁnition of a Spector pointclass was a bit complicated, because it involved
the subtle substitution property. We give here an elegant characterization of Spector
pointclasses in terms of a closure property much simpler than substitution.
4D.17 (Kechris). Let Γ be a Σ-pointclass closed under ∀ù, ù-parametrized and
normed. Prove that Γ is a Spector pointclass if and only if it satisﬁes the following
property of closure under restricted quantiﬁcation: if Q ⊆X × Z × Y is in Γ and
P(x, z) ⇐⇒
 ∃y ∈∆(z)

Q(x, z, y),
then P is also in Γ.
Hint. Spector pointclasses are closed under restricted quantiﬁcation by 4D.3.
Conversely, to establish the substitution property for some Γ satisfying the hypothe-
ses above, suppose Q ⊆Y is in Γ and f : X ⇀Y is computed on its domain by some
P ⊆X × ù in Γ. Put
Q∗(x) ⇐⇒
 ∃y ∈∆(x)

clearly Q∗is in Γ and
f(x)↓& f(x) ∈∆(x) =⇒

Thus to complete the proof it will be suﬃcient to check that under the condition on Γ,
f(x)↓=⇒f(x) ∈∆(x).
Suppose f(x) = y and put
S(n, s) ⇐⇒P(x, s) & radius(Ns) ≤2−n.
Clearly S is in Γ(x), which is adequate, closed under ∃ù, ∀ù and normed. Also
(∀n)(∃s)S(n, s), so by the ∆-Selection Principle 4B.5 there is a ∆(x)-recursive function

Unfortunately this elegant characterization is not useful in practice since it is usually
much easier to establish that a given Γ satisﬁes the substitution property rather than
prove directly closure under restricted quantiﬁcation.

4E. The uniformization theorem for Π1
1, Σ1
2
(19–22)
We now proceed to establish one of the central results in the subject, that Π1
1 sets
can be uniformized by Π1
1 sets. The key tool for the proof is the notion of a scale.
A scale on a pointset P is a sequence ϕ = {ϕn}n∈ù of norms on P such that the
following limit condition holds: if x0, x1, x2, . . . are in P and limi→∞xi = x and if
for each n, the sequence of ordinals
ϕn(x0), ϕn(x1), ϕn(x2), . . .
is ultimately constant, say
ϕn(xi) = ën
for all large i, then P(x) and for every n,
ϕn(x) ≤ën.
Thus a scale is just a semiscale (in the sense of 2B) which satisﬁes an additional lower
semicontinuity property.
As with norms, there are many trivial scales on a pointset, at least if we use the axiom
of choice: choose a one-to-one norm ϕ : P ֌
→κ and a set for each n, ϕn(x) = ϕ(x).
Again as with norms, we get a nontrivial concept by imposing deﬁnability conditions.
Let Γ be a pointclass and ϕ = {ϕn}n∈ù a scale on some set P. We call ϕ a Γ-scale if
there are relations SΓ(n, x, y), S ˘Γ(n, x, y) in Γ and ¬Γ respectively, such that for every
y,
P(y) =⇒(∀n)(∀x){[P(x) & ϕn(x) ≤ϕn(y)] ⇐⇒SΓ(n, x, y)
(∗)
⇐⇒S ˘Γ(n, x, y)}
(1)
In other words, ϕ is a Γ-scale if all the norms ϕn are Γ-norms, uniformly in n.
It is trivial to verify as in 4B.1 that if Γ is adequate and ϕ is a scale on some P in Γ,
then ϕ is a Γ-scale exactly when the relations
R(n, x, y) ⇐⇒x ≤∗
ϕn y,
S(n, x, y) ⇐⇒x <∗
ϕn y,
are in Γ.
A pointclass Γ is scaled or has the scale property if every pointset in Γ admits a
Γ-scale. It is often suﬃcient for our purposes to prove that pointsets of type 1 in Γ
admit Γ-scales, whether or not the stronger scale property holds in Γ (see 4E.6).
4E.1. Theorem. Every Π1
1 pointset of type 1 admits a Π1
1-scale; similarly, every Π
e
1
1
pointset of type 1 admits a Π
e
1
1-scale.
Proof. Let us ﬁrst develop a bit of notation. If α codes a linear ordering ≤α, i.e.,
α ∈LO as we deﬁned this in 4A, then for every integer n put
≤α↾n = {(s, t) : s ≤α t & t <α n}
= {(s, t) : α(⟨s, t⟩) = 1 & α(⟨t, n⟩) = 1 & α(⟨n, t⟩) ̸= 1}.
Clearly ≤α↾n is also a linear ordering—it is the initial segment of ≤α with top n, if n
is in the ﬁeld of ≤α and it is the empty relation otherwise. If ≤α is a wellordering with
rank function ñ, then for each n, ≤α↾n is a wellordering and
ñ(n) = | ≤α↾n|.

We claim that ϕ = {ϕn}n∈ù is a Π1
1-scale on P.
To prove this, assume that limi xi = x with x0, x1, . . . in P and that for each n and
all large i,
ϕn(xi) = ⟨ë, ën⟩.
This implies immediately that for each n and all large i,
| ≤f(xi)↾n| = ën.
The key to the proof is the fact that f is continuous, being recursive. Let us ﬁrst use
this to prove that the mapping
n 7→ën
is order-preserving from ≤f(x) into the ordinals. This holds because
n <f(x) m =⇒f(x)(⟨n, m⟩) = 1 & f(x)(⟨m, n⟩) ̸= 1
=⇒for all large i, f(xi)(⟨n, m⟩) = 1 & f(xi)(⟨m, n⟩) ̸= 1
(by the continuity of f)
=⇒for all large i, n <f(xi) m
=⇒for all large i, | ≤f(xi)↾n| < | ≤f(xi)↾m|
=⇒ën < ëm,
where the last implication is justiﬁed since for all large i, | ≤f(xi)↾n| = ën.
Since n 7→ën is order-preserving, ≤f(x) is a wellordering, i.e., f(x) ∈WO and we
know P(x). The same fact implies that for every n,
| ≤f(x)↾n| ≤ën
since | ≤f(x)↾n| is the rank of n in ≤f(x) and every order-preserving map dominates
the rank function by 2G.7. Similarly,
| ≤f(x) | ≤ë,
because
| ≤f(x) | = supremum{| ≤f(x)↾n| + 1 : n ∈ù}
≤supremum{ën + 1 : n ∈ù} ≤ë,
the last inequality following from the fact that for each n and all large i,
ën = | ≤f(xi)↾n| < | ≤f(xi) | = ë;

we are appealing here to (*), following the proof of Theorem 4A.3. Thus
ϕn(x) = ⟨| ≤f(x) |, | ≤f(x)↾n|⟩≤⟨ë, ën⟩
and ϕ is a scale on P.
To show that ϕ is a Π1
1-scale, ﬁnd ( easily) a recursive g such that for α ∈LO,

As with semiscales in the proof of the Kunen-Martin Theorem, here too we often
need scales with very special properties. A scale ϕ = {ϕn}n∈ù on P ⊆X is very good
if the following two conditions hold:
(1) If x0, x1, . . . are in P and for each n and all large i, ϕn(xi) = ën, then there exists
some x ∈P such that limi→∞xi = x (and hence for each n, ϕn(x) ≤ën).
(2) If x, y are in P and ϕn(x) ≤ϕn(y), then for each i ≤n, ϕi(x) ≤ϕi(y).
Condition (1) implies that ϕ is a good semiscale in the sense of 2G.
4E.2. Lemma. Let Γ be an adequate pointclass. If a pointset P of type 1 in Γ admits
a Γ-scale, then P admits a very good Γ-scale.
Proof. Assume at ﬁrst that P ⊆N is a set of irrationals and let ø = {øn}n∈ù be
a Γ-scale on P. Choose ë ≥ù and large enough so that all the norms øn are into ë.
For each n, wellorder the sequences of length 2n of the form (î0, k0, î1, k1, . . . , în, kn)
(îi < ë, ki ∈ù) lexicographically,
(î0, k0, . . . , în, kn) ≤(ç0, l0, . . . , çn, ln)
⇐⇒î0 < ç0
∨[î0 = ç0 & k0 < l0]
∨[î0 = ç0 & k0 = l0 & î1 < ç1]
∨· · ·
∨[î0 = ç0 & · · · & în = çn & kn ≤ln]
and let
(î0, k0, . . . , în, kn) 7→⟨î0, k0, . . . , în, kn⟩
be an order-preserving map of this ordering into the ordinals. Finally put
ϕn(α) = ⟨ø0(α), α(0), ø1(α), α(1), . . . , øn(α), α(n)⟩
We will show that ϕ = {ϕn}n∈ù is a very good Γ-scale on P.
Suppose ﬁrst that α0, α1, . . . are in P and for each n and all large i, ϕn(αi) is
constant,
ϕn(αi) = ⟨ø0(αi), αi(0), . . . , øn(αi), αi(n)⟩
= ⟨în
0, kn
0, . . . , în
n, kn
n⟩.

4. Structure theory for pointclasses
[4E.2
Since by the deﬁnition
kn
j = αi(j)
(j ≤n, all large i),
it follows that
kn
j = kj
is independent of n and
limi→x αi = α = (k0, k1, . . . ).
Similarly,
în
j = øj(αi)
(j ≤n, all large i),
so that
în
j = îj
is independent of n and for all large i,
øj(αi) = îj.
Since ø is a scale, we thus have α ∈P and for each j, øj(α) ≤îj; from this follows
immediately that for each n,
ϕn(α) ≤⟨î0, k0, î1, k1, . . . , în, kn⟩.
It is also immediate from the deﬁnition that for x, y in P,
ϕn(x) ≤ϕn(y) =⇒for each i ≤n, ϕi(x) ≤ϕi(y),
so that ϕ is a very good scale.
To prove that ϕ is a Γ-scale, let
α ∼øi â ⇐⇒α ≤∗
øi â & â ≤∗
øi α
and put
R(n, α, â) ⇐⇒α <∗
ø0 â
∨[α ∼ø0 â & α(0) < â(0)]

∨[α ∼ø0 â & α(0) = â(0) & · · · & α ∼øn â & α(n) ≤â(n)]

.
Clearly R is in Γ and
α ≤∗
ϕn â ⇐⇒R(n, α, â),
so ϕ is a Γ-scale, since the argument for <∗
ϕn is similar.
Finally, if Q ⊆X is of type 1 with X ̸= N, let

is a very good Γ-scale on Q.
⊣
There are many interesting results about scales and we will look at some of them
in the exercises and again in Chapter 6. Here we concentrate on the relation between
scales and uniformization.
4E.3. The Uniformization Lemma.
If Γ is adequate, X is of type 0 or 1 and
P ⊆X × N admits a Γ-scale, then P can be uniformized by some P∗in ∀N Γ.
Proof. By 4E.2, let ϕ = {ϕn}n∈ù be a very good Γ-scale on P, let
R(n, x, α) ⇐⇒(∀â)[(x, α) ≤∗
ϕn (x, â)]
and put
P∗(x, α) ⇐⇒(∀n)R(n, x, α).
It is suﬃcient to show that P∗uniformizes P, since R is obviously in ∀N Γ and hence
P∗is in ∀N Γ.
To begin with, clearly
P∗(x, α) =⇒P(x, α),
since
P∗(x, α) =⇒(x, α) ≤∗
ϕ0 (x, α)
=⇒P(x, α).
Assume now that for some ﬁxed x, (∃α)P(x, α); we must show that in the case
there is exactly one α such that P∗(x, α).
Keeping x ﬁxed, put
ën = inﬁmum{ϕn(x, α) : P(x, α)}
and let (see Figure 4E.1)
A0 = {α : P(x, α)}
An+1 = {α : P(x, α) & ϕn(x, α) = ën}
= {α : (∀â)[(x, α) ≤∗
ϕn (x, â)]}
= {α : R(n, x, α)}.

178
4. Structure theory for pointclasses
[4E.4
Clearly each An is non-empty and
P∗(x, α) ⇐⇒V
n[α ∈An],
so it is enough to prove that T
n An is a singleton.
Notice that
A0 ⊇A1
and by the second condition on a very good scale,
(∀â)[(x, α) ≤∗
ϕn+1 (x, â)] =⇒(∀â)[(x, α) ≤∗
ϕn (x, â)],
so that in fact
A0 ⊇A1 ⊇A2 ⊇· · · .
Choose now some αi ∈Ai, one for each i. We then have ϕn(x, αi) = ën for each
i > n, so by the ﬁrst condition on a very good scale, there is some α such that
α = limi→∞αi,
P(x, α), and for each n,
ϕn(x, α) ≤ën;
by the deﬁnition of ën then,
ϕn(x, α) = ën,
so α ∈T
n An and this intersection is non-empty. Moreover, if also â ∈T
n An then
the sequence
α0, â, α1, â, α2, â, . . . = ã0, ã1, ã2, ã3, . . .
has the property that for each n and all large i, ϕn(x, ãi) is constant, so that limi→∞ãi
must converge, presumably both to â and to α = limi→∞αi, so that â = α. Hence
T
n An is the singleton {α}, which is what we needed to show.
⊣
A pointclass Γ has the uniformization property if every P ⊆X × Y in Γ can be
uniformized by some P∗in Γ.

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that P ⊆X × Y is in Π1
1. If Y is of type 0, the result follows
from 4B.4. If not, let
ð : N ֌
→Y
be a ∆1
1 isomorphism of N with Y, let
ó : X ∗֌

Now Q is Π1
1 and by 4E.3 we can ﬁnd a Π1
1 set Q∗⊆X ∗× N which uniformizes Q.
It is immediate that the Π1

P∗(x, y) ⇐⇒Q∗ ó−1(x), ð−1(y)

uniformizes P.

with Q in Π1
1. Applying the result about Π1
1 to Q ⊆X × (Y × N), we get a Π1
1 set
Q∗⊆X × (Y × N) which uniformizes Q. Then
P∗(x, y) ⇐⇒(∃α)Q∗(x, y, α)
is easily seen to uniformize P.
⊣
We will see in Chapter 5 that this is just about the strongest uniformization theorem
which can be proved in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory; it is consistent with the axioms
of Zermelo-Fraenkel (including choice) that there exists a Π1
2 set which cannot be
uniformized by any “deﬁnable” set—in particular, it cannot be uniformized by any
projective set.
Among the many important consequences of the uniformization theorem, perhaps
the most signiﬁcant is the basis result for Σ1
2 which we now explain.
A set of points (in various spaces) B is called a basis for a pointclass Γ, if every
non-empty set in Γ has a member in B, i.e., for P ⊆X in Γ,
(∃x)P(x) ⇐⇒(∃x ∈B)P(x).
We also say that a pointclass Λ is a basis for Γ if the set of Λ-recursive points is a basis
for Γ, i.e., for P in Γ,
(∃x)P(x) ⇐⇒(∃x ∈Λ)P(x).
In 4D.10 we proved that ∆1
1 is not a basis for Π0
1, and hence it is not a basis for Σ1
1
or Π1
1.
4E.5. The Basis Theorem for Σ1
2. The pointclass ∆1
2 is a basis for Σ1
2 and more
generally, for each x, ∆1
2(x) is a basis for Σ1
2(x). Thus, if P ⊆X × Y is in Σ1
2, then
(∃y)P(x, y) ⇐⇒
 ∃y ∈∆1
2(x)

P(x, y).
Proof. The second assertion immediately implies the ﬁrst.
To prove it, given
P ⊆X × Y, choose P∗⊆X × Y in Σ1
2 which uniformizes P.
If (∃y)P(x, y),
then there exists exactly one y which satisﬁes P∗(x, y), call it y∗; clearly
y∗∈Ns ⇐⇒(∃y)[P∗(x, y) & y ∈Ns]
⇐⇒(∀y)[P∗(x, y) =⇒y ∈Ns],
so y∗is ∆1
2(x)-recursive.
⊣
Again this result is best possible in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, i.e., we cannot
prove in this theory that every non-empty Π1
2 set must contain a “deﬁnable” element.

The analog of 4B.3 also holds for scales, i.e., if Γ is scaled, adequate and closed
under ∀N , then ∃N Γ is also scaled. There is a bit of computation to this and we will
postpone it until Chapter 6 when we will need it.
The next result is implicit in the proof of 4E.4, but we put it down for the record.
4E.7. Prove that if Γ is adequate and closed under substitution of ∆1
1 functions and
∀N and if every pointset of type 1 in Γ admits a Γ-scale, then both Γ and ∃N Γ have
the uniformization property.
Every non-empty Σ1
1 set has a ∆1
2 member by 4E.5 but need not have a ∆1
1 member
by 4D.10. The correct basis for Σ1

2, by the next result.

We call a set, function or point recursive in P if it is recursive in αP. Notice that we
only deﬁne these notions here for P of type 0—the correct concept of recursion relative
to an arbitrary pointset is quite complicated and we will not go into it now.

T = {(a0, b0, a1, b1, . . . , at−1, bt−1) : (∀i < t)R(⟨a0, . . . , ai⟩, ⟨b0, . . . , bi⟩)}.
Any inﬁnite branch of this tree will determine an element of Q, so our aim is to ﬁnd a
deﬁnable inﬁnite branch. The basic idea of the proof is that the leftmost inﬁnite branch
(see Figure 4E.2) of T is recursive in some Σ1
1 set P of type 0.
Recall the function u ∗v from (∗18) of 3A.6 and suppose that we can ﬁnd integers
a0, b0, a1, b1, . . . such that for every n,
(∃α)(∃â)(∀t)R
 ⟨a0, . . . , an−1⟩∗α(t), ⟨b0, . . . , bn−1⟩∗â(t)

;
(∗)
choosing α, â to witness this, and taking t = 0, we have in particular
(∀n)R(⟨a0, . . . , an−1⟩, ⟨b0, . . . , bn−1⟩),
i.e., with α(n) = an, â(n) = bn now, we have
(∀n)R
 α(n), â(n)

,
so α ∈Q.
It is clear that (∗) simply asserts that an inﬁnite branch of T starts with the ﬁnite se-
quence (a0, b0, . . . , an−1, bn−1). We now choose for each n the leftmost ﬁnite sequence
which is the beginning of some inﬁnite branch. To be precise, put
P(u, v) ⇐⇒(∃α)(∃â)(∀t)R
 u ∗α(t), v ∗â(t)

;
clearly P is Σ1
1. It is easy to verify that
P(u, v) =⇒(∃n)(∃m)P(u ∗⟨n⟩, v ∗⟨m⟩).
Thus we can deﬁne α = (a0, a1, . . . ), â = (b0, b1, . . . ) as above, recursive in P, by the
simple recursion

This shows how to assign to each Σ1
1 set Q ⊆N a Σ1
1 set P of type 0 such that
{x : x is recursive in P} is a basis for the single pointset Q. To get a single P so that
{x : x is recursive in P} is a basis for Σ1
1 subsets of N, apply this procedure to some
Q ⊆ù × N which is universal for Σ1
1 ↾N. Moreover, to see that this yields a basis for
Σ1
1, use the fact that for every X there is a recursive surjection ð : N ։ X and that if
α is recursive in P and ð is recursive, then ð(α) is recursive in P.
⊣
It should be quite obvious by now that every basis result implies some uniformization
result, at least implicitly, as a corollary of its proof. The uniformization theorem that
comes out of the preceding exercise is a bit messy, but it is worth putting down because
it implies that we can always ﬁnd measurable uniformizations for Σ

1 set has a ∆1
2 member. The next exercise gives another
basic result for Π1
1 which is stronger, at least superﬁcially.
For any pointclass Γ, a point x is a Γ-singleton if the set {x} is in Γ.

1-singletons is a basis for Π1

Hint. Given P ⊆X in Π1

Q(n, x) ⇐⇒P(x)
and let Q∗⊆Q uniformize Q in Π1

On the other hand, if we impose the weakest natural closure property on a basis for
Π1

2.
4E.11. Suppose B is a set of points which is a basis for Π1
1 and which is closed under
Turing reducibility ≤T , i.e.,
y ∈B and x is recursive in y =⇒x ∈B.
Prove that B contains every ∆1
2 point.
Hint. If α is a ∆1
2 irrational, then the set P = {â : â = α} is easily Σ1
2,
P(â) ⇐⇒(∃ã){(∀s)[ã ∈Ns =⇒α ∈Ns] & ã = â}.
Let
P(â) ⇐⇒(∃ã)Q(â, ã)
with Q in Π1
1 and let Q∗⊆Q be in Π1
1 and uniformize Q. Now Q∗is non-empty, so
it must contain a point of B, which must be (α, ã) for some ã. Since α is recursive in
(α, ã), α ∈B. It follows easily that B contains the ∆1
2 points in all spaces.

4F. Additional results about Π1
1
Most of the results in this chapter have been about a general Spector pointclass Γ,
perhaps with an additional hypothesis that Γ is closed under ∀N or that it has the scale
property. Here we will look at some very speciﬁc properties of Π1
1 which do not follow
easily from neat, axiomatic assumptions. These results too will be extended to some
of the higher Kleene pointclasses in Chapter 6, using strong set-theoretic hypotheses,
but we will need new proofs for them.
First, an eﬀective version of the Perfect Set Theorem 2C.2.
4F.1. The Eﬀective Perfect Set Theorem (Harrison [1967]). If P ⊆X is a Σ1
1
pointset which has at least one member not in ∆1
1, then P has a non-empty perfect subset.
Similarly, if P is Σ1
1(z) with some member not in ∆1
1(z), then P has a non-empty perfect
subset.
In particular, if P ⊆X is Σ1
1(z) and countable, then P ⊆∆1
1(z) ∩X.
Proof (Mansﬁeld [1970]). The argument for Σ1
1(z) is identical with that for Σ1
1, so
we only prove the absolute version.
We may assume that P has no ∆1
1 members, since {x ∈P : x /∈∆1
1} is also Σ1
1
by 4D.14. Suppose X = N, to begin with, choose a recursive R such that
P(α) ⇐⇒(∃â)(∀t)R
 α(t), â(t)

,
and let
T =

(a0, b0, . . . , an−1, bn−1) : (∀i < n)R(⟨a0, . . . , ai⟩, ⟨b0, . . . , bi⟩)
& (∃α′)(∃â)(∀t)R
 ⟨a0, . . . , an−1⟩∗α′(t), ⟨b0, . . . , bn−1⟩∗â(t)
	
;
clearly T is a tree on ù × ù and in the notation of 2C,
P = p[T].
Look up the proof of the Perfect Set Theorem 2C.2. We claim that in the notation
used there,
T = S;
because if not, then there is some u = (a0, b0, . . . , an−1, bn−1) ∈T with p[Tu] a
singleton {α} and
α(n) = m ⇐⇒(∃α′)(∃â)

(∀t)R
 ⟨a0, . . . , an−1⟩∗α′(t),
⟨b0, . . . , bn−1⟩∗â(t)

& α′(n) = m
	
,
so easily α is ∆1
1.
Now p[S] = p[T] ̸= ∅, so P = p[T] has a perfect non-empty subset as in the proof
of 2C.2.
The result follows for arbitrary X as in 2C.2, using 3E.6.
⊣
This theorem implies in particular that Borel sets with countable sections can be
uniformized by Borel sets, see 4F.6.
The next result is a converse to 4D.3 for the case Γ = Π1

4F.2. Lemma. There is a Π0
1 relation S(α, â, ã), such that whenever â ∈WO and
α ∈LO,
α ∈WO & |α| ≤|â| ⇐⇒(∃ã)S(α, â, ã)
⇐⇒
 ∃ã ∈∆1
1(α, â)

S(α, â, ã).
Proof. The notation is that of 4A. As in the proof of 4A.7, put
Q(α, â, ã) ⇐⇒ã maps ≤α onto an initial segment of ≤â in an order-
perserving fashion and ã = 0 outside the ﬁeld of ≤α,
where we allow “initial segment” to include all of ≤α. As in that exercise, Q is easily
Π0
2, say
Q(α, â, ã) ⇐⇒(∀n)(∃m)R(α, â, ã, n, m)
with R recursive. Put further,
Q∗(α, â, ã, ä) ⇐⇒(∀n)R
 α, â, ã, n, ä(n)

and notice that
Q(α, â, ã) ⇐⇒(∃ä)Q∗(α, â, ã, ä)
⇐⇒
 ∃ä ∈∆1
1(α, â, ã)

Q∗(α, â, ã, ä),
since if (∃ä)Q∗(α, â, ã, ä), we can choose
ä(n) = least mR(α, â, ã, n, m),
and this ä is clearly in ∆1
1(α, â, ã).
Moreover, it is immediate that if â ∈WO and α ∈LO, then
α ∈WO & |α| ≤|â| =⇒there is a unique ã such that Q(α, â, ã)
=⇒
 ∃ã ∈∆1
1(α, â)

Q(α, â, ã),
since the unique ã such that Q(α, â, ã) is surely in ∆1
1(α, â). Thus we have, for â ∈WO
and α ∈LO,
α ∈WO & |α| ≤|â| ⇐⇒(∃ã)(∃ä)Q∗(α, â, ã, ä)
⇐⇒

 ∃ä ∈∆1

=⇒
 ∃ã ∈∆1

Q∗(α, â, ã, ä).
Finally, take

and verify easily that the lemma holds with this S.

4. Structure theory for pointclasses
[4F.3
Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that P is ∆1
1. By 4A.7 there is a Π0
1 set A ⊆N and a recursive
ð : N →X which is injective on A and ð[A] = P. Hence,
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃α)[α ∈A & ð(α) = x]
⇐⇒
 ∃α ∈∆1
1(x)

[α ∈A & ð(α) = x],
where the second equivalence holds because if ð(α) = x and α ∈A, then α is the
unique irrational satisfying these conditions and it is easily ∆1
1(x). Thus for a ∆1
1 set P
we have the stronger representation:
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃α)R(x, α)
⇐⇒(∃a unique α)R(x, α)
⇐⇒
 ∃α ∈∆1
1(x)

R(x, α),
where R is some Π0
1 set.
Towards proving the result for Π1
1 pointsets of type 0 or 1, recall ﬁrst 4D.14 according
to which {(α, x) : α ∈∆1
1(x)} is Π1
1. Hence, for X of type 0 or 1, there is a recursive
function g : N × X →N such that for each α, x, g(α, x) ∈LO and
α ∈∆1
1(x) ⇐⇒g(α, x) ∈WO.
For each x, let
ùx
1 = supremum{|â| : â is recursive in x, â ∈WO};
by the relativized version of 4A.4, easily, for each x
supremum{|g(α, x)| : α ∈∆1
1(x)} = ùx
1 ,
(1)
or else {α : α ∈∆1
1(x)} would be ∆1
1(x), contradicting 4D.16.
Suppose now P ⊆X is Π1
1, with X of type 0 or 1, so there is a recursive f : X →N
such that for each x, f(x) ∈LO and
P(x) ⇐⇒f(x) ∈WO.
From (1) we get immediately
P(x) ⇐⇒
 ∃α ∈∆1
1(x)

[f(x) ∈WO & |f(x)| ≤|g(α, x)|],
since for each x, f(x) is recursive in x. We claim
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃α ∈∆1
1(x))(∃ã ∈∆1
1(x))S
 f(x), g(α, x), ã

,
(2)
where S is the Π0
1 set of the lemma.
To prove direction (=⇒) of (2), assume P(x); then f(x) ∈WO and f(x) is
recursive in x, so by (1) there is some α ∈∆1
1(x) such that |f(x)| ≤|g(α, x)|. By
the lemma then, there is some ã ∈∆1
1
 f(x), g(α, x)

such that S
 f(x), g(α, x), ã

;
but clearly, ã ∈∆1
1(x) by 3E.17 since f(x) is recursive in x and g(α, x) is recursive in
(α, x) and hence ∆1
1(x).
To prove direction (⇐=) of (2), suppose there is an α ∈∆1
1(x) and some ã such
that S
 f(x), g(α, x), ã

. Now g(α, x) ∈WO and f(x) ∈LO, so by the lemma we
have f(x) ∈WO, i.e., P(x).
This completes the proof of (2). From (2) we get the theorem for any pointset of
type 0 or 1 by a trivial contraction of quantiﬁers.
Finally, suppose P ⊆X where X is not of type 0 or 1, so there is a ∆1
1 isomorphism
ð : N ֌
→X.

⊣
The Spector-Gandy Theorem does not have many applications but it is undoubtedly
one of the jewels of the eﬀective theory. It gives a very elegant characterization of Π1
1
in terms of a (restricted) existential quantiﬁer which is particularly signiﬁcant in the
case of relations on ù: P ⊆ù is Π1
1 if and only if there is a Π0
1 set R ⊆ù ×N such that
P(n) ⇐⇒(∃α ∈∆1
1)R(n, α).
This corollary says in eﬀect that the collection of ∆1
1 irrationals somehow “determines”
the collection of Π1
1 relations on ù.
The third main result of this section is also peculiar to the eﬀective theory, like the
Spector-Gandy theorem. It diﬀers from it in that it says something most signiﬁcant
about perfect product spaces.
A set P ⊆X is thin if P has no perfect subsets other than ∅. Countable sets are thin,
and by the Perfect Set Theorem, every Σ
e
1
1 thin set is in fact countable. As we will see
in the next chapter, it is consistent with the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel Set theory
that there exist uncountable, thin Π1
1 sets.
4F.4. The Largest Thin Π1
1 Set Theorem (Guaspari [1975?], Kechris [1975], Sacks
[1976]). For each perfect product space X, there is a thin, Π1
1 set C1 = C1(X) ⊆X
which contains every thin, Π1
1 subset of X.
Proof. Fix X and let G ⊆ù × X be universal for the Π1
1 subsets of X, let
ϕ : G →Ordinals
be a Π1
1-norm on G. Put
R(n, x) ⇐⇒G(n, x) & [{y : G(n, y) & ϕ(n, y) ≤ϕ(n, x)} is countable].
(1)
We claim:
R(n, x) ⇐⇒G(n, x) & (∀y){[G(n, y) & ϕ(n, y) ≤ϕ(n, x)] =⇒y ∈∆1
1(x)}.
(2)
To prove direction (=⇒) of (2), notice that if R(n, x), then the set
A = {y : G(n, y) & ϕ(n, y) ≤ϕ(n, x)}
= {y : (n, y) ≤∗
ϕ (n, x)}

4. Structure theory for pointclasses
[4F.4
is ∆1
1(x), so if A is countable, we must have A ⊆∆1
1(x) ∩X by 4F.1. Conversely,
assuming the right hand side of (2) we immediately infer that A is countable, since
∆1
1(x) ∩X is countable.
Now (2) implies that R is Π1
1, since it yields
R(n, x) ⇐⇒G(n, x) & (∀y)[(n, x) <∗
ϕ (n, y) ∨y ∈∆1
1(x)].
We deﬁne C1 = C1(X) by
C1(x) ⇐⇒(∃n)R(n, x).
Clearly C1 is Π1
1, so it remains to show that C1 is thin and that it contains every thin,
Π1
1 subset of X.
Assume ﬁrst that P ⊆X is thin and Π1
1, so that for some ﬁxed n0,
P(x) ⇐⇒G(n0, x).
For each x in P, {y : G(n0, y) & ϕ(n0, y) ≤ϕ(n0, x)} is ∆1
1(x) as above; in particular,
it is Borel, so it must be countable, since it is a subset of P and cannot have a perfect
subset. Hence
P(x) =⇒G(n0, x) =⇒R(n0, x) =⇒C1(x)
and P ⊆C1.
Suppose now, towards a contradiction, that F ̸= ∅, F is perfect, F ⊆C1, put
Q(n, x) ⇐⇒F (x) & R(n, x).
The relation Q is Π
e
1
1 and (∀x ∈F )(∃n)Q(x, n), so by the ∆-Selection Principle 4B.5,
there is a Borel function g : X →ù such that
(∀x ∈F )R
 g(x), x

.
The map
x 7→
 g(x), x

is also Borel and maps F into G. Now G is not in Σ
e
1
1 by 3E.9 (otherwise every Π1
1
subset of X would be in Σ
e
1
1), hence by the Covering Lemma 4C.11 there exists an
ordinal ë < |ϕ|, such that
x ∈F =⇒ϕ
 g(x), x

≤ë.
The ordinal ë is countable, since |ϕ| ≤ä
e
1
1 = ℵ1. Letting
An,î = {x : R(n, x) & ϕ(n, x) = î},
this means that
F ⊆S
n,î≤ë An,î.
However, each An,î is countable, since
An,î ⊆{y : G(n, y) & ϕ(n, y) ≤ϕ(n, x)}
with any point x such that R(n, x) and ϕ(n, x) = î, so F is countable, contradicting
the assumption that it is perfect and not empty.
⊣
This theorem has led to an interesting theory of the structure of countable and thin
Π1
1 sets which we will not pursue here beyond 4F.7 and 4F.8. See Kechris [1975],
[1973].

is easily ∆1

1(y).
This proves comparability and transitivity is already known from 3E.17. To prove that
≤is wellfounded, assume that x, y are in C and y is not ∆1
1(x) and prove as above
that ϕ(x) ≤ϕ(y).
⊣
In the remaining exercises we outline the proofs of several uniformization theorems
of Borel sets.
Let us ﬁrst recall a simple fact about trees which will be needed below.
4F.9 (K¨onig’s Lemma). Let T be a tree on a set X which is ﬁnitely splitting, i.e.,
every sequence u = (x0, . . . , xn−1) in T has at most ﬁnitely many one-point extensions
in T, (x0, . . . , xn−1, y1), . . . , (x0, . . . , xn−1, yk). Prove that T is inﬁnite if and only if it
has an inﬁnite branch.
Hint. If (x0, x1, . . . ) is an inﬁnite branch, then for each n, (x0, . . . , xn−1) ∈T, so
T is inﬁnite. If T is inﬁnite, then for some x0 the subtree T(x0) must be inﬁnite, since
T = T(y1) ∪· · · ∪T(yk) for some y1, . . . , yk. Again, for some x1 the subtree T(x0,x1)
must be inﬁnite, so recursively we get an inﬁnite branch (x0, x1, . . . ).
⊣
Fix a product space X and for simplicity of notation let
N(s) = N(X, s)
be the s’th basic nbhd of X. A ﬁnitely splitting tree of nbhds of X is a tree T on ù which
is ﬁnitely splitting and such that if (s0, . . . , sn−1) ∈T, then for each i = 0, . . . , n −1,
radius(Nsi ) ≤2−i. For simplicity we will call these nbhd fans (see Figure 4F.1).
With each nbhd fan T we associate the subset of X
K = K(T) =

x : (∃α)(∀n)
 α(0), . . . , α(n −1)

 α(n −1)
	
.
It is not hard to verify that each K(T) is a compact subset of X and each compact set
K is K(T) with a suitable nbhd fan T. In the next result we get an eﬀective version of
this.
Let us say that a nbhd fan T is in a pointclass Λ if the set of codes of the sequences
in T is in Λ, i.e., if
T c = {⟨s0, . . . , sn−1⟩: (s0, . . . , sn−1) ∈T}
is in Λ.

∅̸= F [A ∩Ns] ⊆Kn.
Hint. Towards a contradiction, suppose no F [A ∩Ns] is contained in some Kn.
In particular, there is some x = F (α) /∈K0, so there is a nbhd M of x such that
M ∩K0 = ∅. We can then ﬁnd a basic nbhd N 0 of α such that F [A ∩N 0] ⊆M, in
particular
F [A ∩N 0] ∩K0 = ∅
as in Figure 4F.3. Assume now that F [A ∩N 0] is not a subset of K1, so there is some
x = F (α) with α ∈A ∩N 0, x /∈K1 and repeat the argument. Thus we get a sequence
of basic nbhds
N 0 ⊇N 1 ⊇· · ·
in N such that each F [A∩N i] is non-empty and F [A ∩N i]∩Ki = ∅. If we also make

The set
{s : (∃x /∈C)[s = f(x)]}

the separation theorem gives us a ∆set I between these two such as the open set

A ∩G = ∅
x /∈C =⇒x ∈G
so in particular,
x /∈B =⇒x ∈G,

We now imitate the construction of 4F.10 above to get a nbhd fan T such that the
associated set K(T) satisﬁes

by some P∗in ∆1
1(z).
Similarly, if P ⊆X × Y is Borel and every section Px is ó-compact, then ∃YP is
Borel and P can be uniformized by some Borel P∗(Arsenin [1940], Kunugui [1940];
see also Larman [1972]).
Hint. Use 4F.15 and the ∆-Uniformization Criterion 4D.4. If P is Borel, use the

some P∗⊆ù × X × Y in ∆1
1(z) such that
P(x, y) ⇐⇒(∀n)P∗(n, x, y)

In particular, if P ⊆X × Y is Borel and each section Px is ó-compact, then there
exist Borel sets P∗

P = S

and each P∗

Hint. To simplify notation suppose P is ∆1

It is easy to verify that A∗is a Π1
1 set, using the representation of compact ∆1
1 sets via
nbhd fans and it is obvious that A∗is open. We will prove that A ⊆A∗.
Assume towards a contradiction that
B = A \ A∗
is non-empty and notice that B is Σ1
1 and closed. Since
F [B] ⊆F [A] = S
n Kn
with each Kn compact, 4F.13 above implies that for some s, n

so that for some s, F [B ∩Ns] is a non-empty compact subset of P. Since F [B ∩Ns]
is in Σ1
1, 4F.14 then guarantees that there is a ∆1
1, compact set K such that
F [B ∩Ns] ⊆K ⊆P.
Fix α ∈B ∩Ns and suppose â ∈Ns ∩A. If â ∈A∗then F (â) is a member of some
∆1
1, compact set by deﬁnition; if â /∈A∗, then â ∈A \ A∗= B, so F (â) ∈K, so again
F (â) is a member of some ∆1
1, compact set. This establishes that α ∈A∗, contradicting
α ∈B. Thus we have shown
A ⊆A∗.
It then follows immediately that
x ∈P =⇒for some ∆1
1, compact set K ⊆P, x ∈K.
Call α ∈N a code of the nbhd fan T if
(s0, . . . , sn−1) ∈T ⇐⇒α(⟨s0, . . . , sn−1⟩) = 1
and put
Q(x, i) ⇐⇒x ∈P & d(i)↓& d(i) codes a nbhd fan T in ∆1
1
such that K(T) ⊆P and x ∈K(T),
where d parametrizes ∆1
1 ∩N by 4D.2. Easily Q is Π1
1 and (∀x ∈P)(∃i)Q(x, i), so
we can ﬁnd a ∆1
1 function f : X →ù such that (∀x ∈P)Q

. Put
R1(i) ⇐⇒(∃x ∈P)[f(x) = i].
Put also
R2(i) ⇐⇒d(i)↓and d(i) codes a ∆1
1, compact subset of P
and notice that R1 is Σ1
1, R2 is Π1
1 and R1 ⊆R2, so we can ﬁnd some ∆1
1 set R such that
R1 ⊆R ⊆R2.
It is now obvious that
i ∈R =⇒d(i)↓and d(i) codes some ∆1
1, compact set Ki
and
P = S{Ki : i ∈R}
so letting
P∗(n, x) ⇐⇒R(n) & x ∈Kn
we have (∗) in the theorem with P∗in ∆1
1 and such that each section P∗
n is compact.
The same argument relativized to a ﬁxed but arbitrary x gives the second assertion
and then the third assertion follows trivially.
To get the full strength of the ﬁrst assertion in the theorem choose â ∈∆1
1 so that
{(â)n : n = 0, 1, . . . } = {d(n) : R(n)},
choose ã ∈∆1
1 so that for each n and m

The basic idea in these uniformization results about Borel sets is that we can ﬁnd
a Borel uniformization when the sections of the given set are “topologically small,”
i.e., ó-compact. We now proceed to show that we can also ﬁnd Borel uniformizations
when the sections are “topologically large,” i.e., not meager.
The key to this type of result is a basic computation of the category of Σ

4F.19 (Kechris [1973]). For each set P ⊆X × Y, put
Q(x) ⇐⇒Px = {y : P(x, y)} is not meager.
Prove that if P is Σ0
n, then Q is also Σ0
n, if P is Σ1
1, then Q is Σ1
1 and if P is Π1
1, then Q
is also Π1
1.
Hint. If P is Σ0
1 and hence open, then by the Baire category Theorem 2H.2
Px is not meager ⇐⇒Px ̸= ∅⇐⇒(∃i)P(x, ri)
where {r0, r1, . . . } is the recursive presentation of Y, so Q is Σ0
1. Now if R is Π0
n−1,
{y : (∃m)R(x, y, m)} is not meager
⇐⇒(∃m)[{y : R(x, y, m)} is not meager]
⇐⇒(∃m)(∃s)[Ns \ {y : R(x, y, m)} is meager]
and by induction hypothesis the relation in the brackets is Π0
n−1, so we are done.
Suppose now
P(x, y) ⇐⇒(∃α)F (x, y, α)
with F in Π0
1 and ﬁx x for the discussion. By the von Neumann Selection Theorem 4E.9
we can ﬁnd a Baire-measurable f : Y →N which uniformizes Fx and then by 2H.10

we can ﬁnd a comeager Gä set A ⊆Y such that the restriction f ↾A of f to A is
continuous as in Figure 4F.6. Choose ε ∈N so that
ε(⟨s, t⟩) = 1 ⇐⇒f[Ns ∩A] ⊆Nt & Ns ∩A ̸= ∅
(∗)
and check ﬁrst that
ε(⟨s, t⟩) = 1 =⇒Fx ∩(Ns × Nt) ̸= ∅,

and check easily that
A ∩Px ⊆Bε.
(3)
If Px is not meager, then (3) implies that Bε is not meager. Thus we have shown
that
Px is not meager =⇒(∃ε){ε satisﬁes (1) and
the set Bε deﬁned by (2) is not meager}.
On the other hand, the deﬁnition of Bε makes sense for arbitrary ε ∈N, in fact the
relation
B(ε, y) ⇐⇒y ∈Bε
is easily Π0
3, hence Σ0
4. Moreover, if for some ﬁxed x and ε the implication (1) holds,
then
y ∈Bε =⇒there are sequences s0, s1, . . . , t0, t1, . . . such that
Ns0 ⊇Ns1 ⊇· · · , Nt0 ⊇Nt1 ⊇· · · , and for each n,
(Nsn × Ntn) ∩Fx ̸= ∅, radius(Nsn) < 1/(n + 1),
radius(Ntn) < 1/(n + 1) and y ∈Nsn
=⇒there is a sequence of points (yn, αn) in Fx such that
limn→∞yn = y and limn→∞αn = α exists
=⇒(∃α)(y, α) ∈Fx
(since Fx is closed)
=⇒y ∈Px.
Thus
Px is not meager ⇐⇒(∃ε){ε satisﬁes (1) and
the set Bε deﬁned by (2) is not meager}
and this relation is immediately Σ1
1.
The claim for Π1
1 sets follows from the remark which we have already used, that for
any set P with the property of Baire,
P is not meager ⇐⇒(∃s)[Ns \ P is meager].

4F.20. Prove that if P ⊆X is Π1
1(z) and not meager, then P has a member in ∆1
1(z).
(Thomason [1967], Hinman [1969]; see Kechris [1973].)
Infer that if P ⊆X × Y is in ∆1
1(z) and each section Px is not meager in Y, then
P can be uniformized by a set in ∆1
1(z); similarly, every Borel set P ⊆X × Y with
non-meager sections can be uniformized by a Borel subset.
Hint. Assume P is Π1
1(z) and not meager and suppose ϕ : P ։ κ is a regular
Π1
1(z)-norm on P. Now
P = S
î<κ{x ∈P : ϕ(x) = î},
so if κ < ℵ1, then by the countable additivity of the collection of meager sets we get
for some ë < κ, {x ∈P : ϕ(x) = ë} is not meager.
(∗)
If κ = ℵ1 then P is not Borel by 4C.10. Choose a Gä, non-meager set A ⊆P by 2H.4
(applied to X \ P) and then use the Covering Lemma 4C.11 to infer that for some
î < κ, A ⊆S
æ<î{x ∈P : ϕ(x) = æ} so that again (∗) holds. We have thus shown
that for any regular, Π1
1(z)-norm on P, (∗) holds.
Fix now a very good Π1
1(z)-scale ϕ = {ϕn} on P, with all the norms regular and
put for each n
ën = least ë such that {x ∈P : ϕn(x) = ë} is not meager,
Pn = {x ∈P : ϕn(x) = ën}.
Putting this another way,
x ∈Pn ⇐⇒{y ∈P : ϕn(y) = ϕn(x)} is not meager
& (∀w)[ϕn(w) < ϕn(x)
=⇒{y ∈P : ϕn(y) = ϕn(w)} is meager]
⇐⇒{y ∈P : ϕn(y) ≤ϕn(x)} is not meager
& {y ∈P : ϕn(y) < ϕn(x)} is meager,
where in the second equivalence we have used again the countable additivity of the
ideal of meager sets and the fact that ϕn(x) < ℵ1.
It is immediate that each Pn is non-empty. Notice also that by the the key property
of a very good scale given in 4E, easily
ϕn+1(y) ≤ϕn+1(x) =⇒ϕn(y) ≤ϕn(x)
and
ϕn(y) < ϕn(x) =⇒ϕn+1(y) < ϕn+1(x),
so that immediately
P0 ⊇P1 ⊇P2 ⊇· · · .
If x0, x1, . . . is any sequence of points with xn ∈Pn, then by the deﬁnition of a very
good scale again, there exists some x such that
limn→∞xn = x and P(x).
Moreover, if y0, y1, . . . is another such sequence converging to some y ∈P, the
sequence
x0, y0, x1, y1, . . .

4F.21]

would have to converge to a unique point, so that x = y. Hence: there is a unique
point x∗which is the limit of some sequence x0, x1, x2, . . . with xn ∈Pn and this
x∗∈P. Since obviously
x = x∗⇐⇒(∀s){x ∈Ns =⇒(∀k)(∃n ≥k)(∃y)[P(n, y) & y ∈Ns]}
it will be enough to prove that the relation
P∗(n, y) ⇐⇒y ∈Pn
is in Σ1
1(z), since this would show that x∗is Σ1
1(z)-recursive and hence (easily) in ∆1
1(z).
Finally this follows easily from the preceding exercise and the equivalence
x ∈Pn ⇐⇒{y : ¬(x <∗
ϕn y)} is not meager
& {y : y <∗
ϕn x} is meager
⇐⇒{y : ¬(x <∗
ϕn y)} is not meager
& (∀s)[(Ns \ {y : y <∗
ϕn x}) is not meager]
which is easy to verify.
This completes the proof of the ﬁrst assertion and the rest follows from the ∆-
Uniformization Criterion 4D.4.
⊣
There is a similar result for measure which we will not prove here—that if P ⊆X ×Y
is Borel and all sections Px have ì-measure > 0 for some ó-ﬁnite Borel measure ì
on Y, then P can be uniformized by a Borel set. (The basic lemma for this is due to
Tanaka [1968] and Sacks [1969].) Kechris [1973] has an excellent discussion of these
and related results as well as additional references.
We will end this section with a negative uniformization result—an obstruction to
improving the von Neumann Selection Theorem. First a computation.
Recall from 4F that
ùx
1 = supremum{|α| : α ∈WO & α ≤T x},
and for any two irrationals α, â let ⟨α, â⟩be the irrational coding their pair as in 1E,
⟨α, â⟩(⟨0, n⟩) = α(n),
⟨α, â⟩(⟨1, n⟩) = â(n),
⟨α, â⟩(t) = 0 if t is not of the form ⟨0, n⟩or ⟨1, n⟩.
4F.21. Prove that the relation
P(α, â) ⇐⇒ù⟨α,â⟩
1
= ùα
1
is Σ1
1 and that for each α, there is a perfect non-empty set C such that
â ∈C =⇒ù⟨α,â⟩
1
= ùα
1 .
Hint. By a direct relativization of 4A.5, for each x,
ùx
1 = ä1
1(x) = supremum{|α| : α ∈WO & ∆1
1(x)}.
Compute:
ù⟨α,â⟩
1
> ùα
1 ⇐⇒[∃ã ∈∆1
1(α, â)]{ã ∈WO & (∀ä)[(ä ∈LO & ä ≤T α)
=⇒(≤ã cannot be mapped in an order-preserving
way onto ≤ä)]}.
This implies immediately that {(α, â) : ù⟨α,â⟩
1
> ùα
1 } is Π1
1 and hence P is Σ1
1.

[4F.22
Since â ∈∆1
1(α) =⇒P(α, â), if the converse implication held, we would have that
∆1
1(α) ∩N is Σ1
1(α) for each α, contradicting 4D.16; thus for each α, the Σ1
1(α) set
{â : P(α, â)} has members not in ∆1
1(α) and hence it contains a perfect set by the
Eﬀective Perfect Set Theorem 4F.1.

Lusin [1930a] claimed that every Σ
e
1
1 set can be uniformized by a set which is the
diﬀerence of two Σ
e
1
1 sets. This is not true.
4F.22. Prove that there exists a Σ1
1 set which cannot be uniformized by the diﬀerence
of two Σ

Hint. Take
P(α, â) ⇐⇒ù⟨α,â⟩
1
= ùα
1 & â /∈∆1
1(α)
which is Σ1
1 by the preceding exercise and 4D.14 and suppose that P is uniformized by
P∗(α, â) ⇐⇒Q(α, â) & ¬R(α, â)
where (equivalently with the hypothesis that P∗is the diﬀerence of two Σ
e
1
1 sets) we
assume that Q and R are Π1
1(α∗) for some ﬁxed α∗. Let â∗be the unique â such that
Q(α∗, â∗) & ¬R(α∗, â∗)
holds.
By 4A.3, there is a recursive function f such that
Q(α, â) ⇐⇒f(α, â) ∈WO;
since Q(α∗, â∗) holds, f(α∗, â∗) ∈WO so that for some î,
|f(α∗, â∗)| ≤î < ù⟨α∗,â∗⟩
1
= ùα∗
1 ,
since P(α∗, â∗) holds and hence ù⟨α∗,â∗⟩
1
= ùα∗
1 . The relation
S(â) ⇐⇒f(α∗, â) ∈WO & |f(α∗, â)| ≤î & ¬R(α∗, â)
is easily in Σ1
1(α∗) and obviously S(â∗) holds; but â∗/∈∆1
1(α∗), so by the Eﬀective
Perfect Set Theorem 4F.1, S contains a perfect set of irrationals. This contradicts the
inclusion
S ⊆{â : P∗(α∗, â)} = {â∗}.

4G. Historical remarks
1The results of this chapter are the hardest to credit,partly because we have presented
them in a modern form which is the end product of the work of many researchers.
In addition to this, there has been considerable duplication, and rediscovery of ideas,
as the recursion theorists often did their work in ignorance of the classical theory.
Since the writing of a detailed and documented history of the subject would be a
formidable (though fascinating) task, I have conﬁned myself below to a few remarks
which indicate the origins of the main ideas (when this is clear from the literature) and
point to the most signiﬁcant papers.
2Let us begin with a brief summary (in somewhat modernized terminology) of
the results of Lusin and Sierpinski [1923], surely one of the most important early
contributions to the theory of analytic sets. Lusin sieves (cribles) were introduced here

4G]
4G. Historical remarks
203
and they were used to obtain a representation theorem for Π
e
1
1 sets quite similar to
our 4A.3.
3A sieve is a map r 7→Fr which assigns to each rational number r a subset Fr of a
space X. The set sifted by the sieve is deﬁned by
x ∈SieverFr ⇐⇒{r : x ∈Fr} is not well ordered,
where we use the standard ordering on the rationals. The basic result of Lusin and
Sierpinski [1923] is that the sets of the form SieverFr with each Fr closed are precisely
the analytic (Σ
e
1
1) sets; thus every coanalytic (Π
e
1
1) set P satisﬁes an equivalence
P(x) ⇐⇒{r : x ∈Fr} is well ordered
with a sieve of closed sets—a representation very similar to that of 4A.3.
4Lusin and Sierpinski [1923] used this characterization of Π
e
1
1 sets to give a new
proof of the Suslin Theorem (∆
e
1
1 =Borel) and also to prove that Σ
e
1
1 sets are both the
union and intersection of ℵ1 Borel sets, our 2F.2. (Half of this result was ﬁrst shown in
Lusin and Sierpinski [1918] which anticipated somewhat this later joint paper.) They
also established the Boundedness Theorem 4A.4 for Π
e
1
1 sets with the natural ordinal
assignment that comes from their representation.
5Fix an enumeration r0, r1, r2, . . . of the rationals and deﬁne the set WO∗⊆C of
binary inﬁnite sequences by
α ∈WO∗= {rn : α(n) = 1} is wellfounded;
this is (essentially) the set of codes for ordinals introduced in Lusin and Sierpin-
ski [1923] and used extensively in the classical development of the theory.
Lusin
and Sierpinski showed that WO∗was Π
e
1
1 but not Σ
e
1
1 and Kuratowski [1966] (§38,
Lemmas 2, 5) gives the essential content of 4A.2.
6The eﬀective version of the Basic Representation Theorem 4A.3 (for X = ù) was
proved in Kleene [1955a], one of the most signiﬁcant contributions to the eﬀective
theory. Kleene’s result asserted that each Π1
1 subset of ù satisﬁes
P(x) ⇐⇒f(x) ∈O,
where f is recursive and O is a set of (integer) notations for the so-called constructive
ordinals. (Incidentally, these had been introduced by Church and Kleene and their
supremum is ùCK
1
, sometimes read “Church-Kleene ù1.”) Kleene’s main motivation
was the study of these ordinals rather than Π1
1 and ∆1
1; but he used his representation
theorem in his [1955b] and [1955c] to study Π1
1 and ∆1
1 and in the second of these papers
he established the eﬀective version of the Suslin Theorem (for X = ù). We will prove
this result in Chapter 7, where we will also cover in some detail the very fundamental
method of deﬁnition by eﬀective transﬁnite recursion introduced in Kleene [1955a].
7A representation theorem for Π1
1 (with X = ù) which is much more similar to 4A.3
was established in Spector [1955], another basic source of ideas for the eﬀective theory.
Spector used integer codes of recursive wellorderings of ù (for ordinals below ùCK
1
),
but other than this, his basic notions were quite close to ours. He also proved 4A.2
(essentially) and 4A.4 (for X = ù) as well as 4A.5.
8Kleene and Spector worked in almost complete ignorance of the classical theory
and there is no apparent lead from the classical work to theirs—except (possibly) for
one slender thread.
9The ordering of ﬁnite sequences of integers which we introduced in the proof
of 4A.3 was ﬁrst deﬁned in Lusin and Sierpinski [1923], where it was used in almost

204
4. Structure theory for pointclasses
[4G
exactly the same way in which we used it. Kleene [1955a] used the same ordering
(essentially for the same purpose) and credits Brouwer [1924] for the deﬁnition and
some of its basic properties—this is Brouwer’s famous intuitionistic proof that every
(constructive, totally deﬁned) real function must be uniformly continuous on closed
intervals. Now, Brouwer has no list of references in his paper, but he might have seen
Lusin and Sierpinski [1923]; the publication dates make this barely possible. In any
case, Brouwer’s background in topology makes it quite likely that he knew the early
papers in descriptive set theory (including Lusin and Sierpinski [1918]) and he might
have been led to the ordering along the same path followed by Lusin and Sierpinski.
10Recursion theorists are apt to refer to the Kleene-Brouwer ordering, while someone
versed in the classical theory would naturally call this the Lusin-Sierpinski ordering.
11As we remarked in the introduction, the relationship between classical descriptive
set theory and Kleene’s theory of the arithmetical and the analytical pointclasses on
ù was ﬁrst perceived as a list of analogies between the two theories, to begin with by
Mostowski and later (and more accurately) by Addison in his Thesis [1954] and later
in his [1959a]. (Addison and Spector were graduate students of Kleene during the
same general period 1951–1954; it is interesting that Addison’s deepening interest in
and knowledge of the classical theory at that time was not eﬀectively transmitted to
Kleene and Spector.) The general, uniﬁed theory which we are studying in this book
evolved slowly in the years since 1955 from these analogies.
12The prewellordering property was ﬁrst isolated explicitly by Moschovakis in
1964, in an eﬀort to ﬁnd common proofs for theorems about Π1
1 and Σ1
2 (on ù);
see Rogers [1967]. (The original version was somewhat more complicated and this
present deﬁnition is due to Kechris.) On the other hand, arguments which involve
ordinal assignments to points (like the index in Lusin and Sierpinski [1918]) pervade
the classical literature both in descriptive set theory and in recursion theory, so many
of the results in 4B–4D are best viewed as elegant and strengthened versions of their
classical, concrete special cases. The credits given in the text refer to these special
cases.
13In particular, Novikoﬀ[1935] assigned ordinals to the points of a Σ
e
1
2 set precisely
as we did in 4B.3, starting with an ordinal assignment from a sieve on the given Π
e
1
1
matrix.
Novikoﬀ[1935] used 4B.3 to settle the problems of separation and non-
separation for Π
e
1
1, Σ
e
1
2 and Π
e
1
2—the separation theorem for Σ
e
1
1 is already in Lusin
[1927]. Kuratowski [1936] inferred the separation property for Π
e
1
2 from the reduction
property for Σ
e
1
2 which he introduced and established. Finally, Addison [1959a] put
down the lightface results in 4B.10, 4B.11 and 4B.12, following both the classical work
and Kleene [1950], where the failure of separation for Σ0
1 was proved.
14The further step of using the prewellordering property as the key tool in study-
ing the structure theory of collections of relations was taken in generalized recursion
theory, particularly in recursion in higher types and inductive deﬁnability; Moschova-
kis [1967], [1969], [1970], [1974a], [1974b] and the present work are successive stages
in the development of what is sometimes called prewellordering theory.
15The present notion of a Spector pointclass is the natural generalization to the
context of Polish spaces of the Spector classes of Moschovakis [1974a]. Theorems 6B.3
and 9A.2 in that monograph correspond to the substitution property and 4C.2 here.
16The study of collections of relations with arguments in several spaces (and espe-
cially Σ-pointclasses and Spector pointclasses) as opposed to studying collections of
subsets of a ﬁxed space (often ó-ﬁelds) is one of the chief methodological diﬀerences

4G]
4G. Historical remarks
205
between our approach to descriptive set theory here and the classical work. We are
forced to look at relations since the eﬀective pointclasses are not closed under count-
able unions but they are closed under projection along ù, to take an example. At the
same time, the use of relations makes the logical computations of complexity (which
were also used in the classical theory) much simpler, so that there is an advantage,
even if one is only interested in the projective pointclasses.
17The parametrization theorem for ∆, 4D.2 is an abstract version of the various
“hierarchies” for the hyperarithmetical sets, for example the sets Ha in Kleene [1955b]
or the sets Wã in Spector [1955]. Similar abstract parametrizations were constructed
directly from the prewellordering property in Moschovakis [1967], [1969] and [1974a]
whose Theorem 5D.4 is the basic model for 4D.2 here.
18Kleene [1959b] has the basic version of 4D.3, for Π1
1, with a proof based on the
hierarchy of the Ha-sets. The upper classiﬁcation of ∆(4D.14) is a trivial consequence
of this. As for the lower classiﬁcation of ∆(4D.16), it has been rediscovered by several
people at various times, with the proof for ∆1
2 usually depending on the Uniformization
theorem 4E.4. The simple argument for ∆1
2 that we gave is due to Kechris.
19Lusin [1930a] introduced the fundamental problem of uniformization and an-
nounced four results. I. Every Σ
e
1
1 set can be uniformized by the diﬀerence of two Σ
e
1
1
sets. (This is actually false, see 4F.22.) II. There is a Σ
e
1
1 set which cannot be uniformized
by a Σ
e
1
1 set. III. Every Borel set can be uniformized by a Π
e
1
1 set (joint result with
Sierpinski). IV. If P ⊆X × Y is Borel and every section Px is countable, then P is
the union of countably many Borel sets P∗
n, each of which uniformizes P. (There was a
similar result for analytic P.)
20Theorem II is equivalent to 4D.11, which we obtained as an immediate corollary
of Kleene’s 4D.10. Novikoﬀ[1931] also gave a proof of this result, as well as a proof
of a weak version of IV, that for Borel P with countable sections the projection ∃YP
is Borel and there exists a Borel uniformization, our 4F.6. The complete IV is 4F.17
here.
21Sierpinski [1930] established III and asked whether every Π
e
1
1 set can be uni-
formized by some projective set. It was a bold question, because Lusin had published
an example which purported to show that one could not “eﬀectively” (in what he called
“realistic mathematics”) uniformize Π
e
1
1 sets. This uniformization problem was soon
recognized as the outstanding problem of descriptive set theory, until Kondo [1938]
solved it using the basic idea introduced by Novikov and published in Lusin and
Novikov [1935].
(Kondo gives additional credit to another Novikov paper where
apparently Π
e
1
1 sets with ﬁnite sections were uniformized.) The lightface version was
worked out by Addison in the late ﬁfties.
22Kondo’s solution of the uniformization problem was in many ways harder than
the problem—his proof appeared to be so complicated that few people ever read it.
But the diﬃculty is only a matter of style, as there is basically only one natural proof
of this result. The present treatment in 4E.1–4E.4 via scales was worked out in 1971
by Moschovakis who was attempting to generalize the result using strong axioms. We
will look at this generalization in Chapter 6.
23For the applications of descriptive set theory to analysis, the most important
uniformization result is von Neumann’s Selection Theorem 4E.9. This was proved
before the war, despite the late publication of Neumann [1949]. Here we obtained it
as a direct corollary of the Kleene Basis Theorem for Σ1
1, 4E.8.

206
4. Structure theory for pointclasses
[4G
24There are many results in the literature on Borel uniformizations of Borel (or
even Σ
e
1
1 and Π
e
1
1) sets with special properties, many of them set in wider contexts
than the category of Polish spaces. We have concentrated on just the basic theorems
which illustrate the applicability of the eﬀective theory to this kind of problem—and
particularly the usefulness of the ∆-uniformization criterion 4D.4. These “eﬀective
proofs of boldface results” have been part of the folklore of the subject for a long time
and there is nothing basically new in our treatment here; the ﬁnal versions of 4F.9–
4F.18 owe much to the seminar notes of some lectures given by Louveau after he had
seen a preliminary version of this chapter.
25Louveau [1980] has obtained recently a very beautiful extension of 4F.18 which
in particular implies the following: if P ⊆X is ∆1
1 and Σ
e
0
n for some n, then P is Σ0
n(α)
for some α ∈∆1
1.

CHAPTER 5
THE CONSTRUCTIBLE UNIVERSE
We have already referred to several consistency and independence results, e.g., that
the continuum hypothesis cannot be settled in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory and that
one cannot prove in this theory that ∆
e
1
2 sets of reals are Lebesgue measurable or that
uncountable Π
e
1
1 pointsets have perfect subsets. To prove rigorously theorems of this
type, one needs the powerful metamathematical tools of modern logic; we will study
some of these quite carefully in Chapter 8. Our main purpose here is to consider
brieﬂy a property of pointsets which holds in G¨odel’s universe of constructible sets and
use it to establish the independence of many important propositions of descriptive set
theory.
G¨odel’s aim was to prove the consistency of the axiom of choice and the generalized
continuum hypothesis with the classical axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (with-
out choice). To do this, he deﬁned a collection L of sets with very special properties,the
constructible sets, and showed (ﬁrst) that if we interpret “set” to mean “constructible
set,” then all the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory become true. In other words,
all these assertions about sets hold in the constructible universe L; it follows that every
logical consequence of these axioms also holds in L. Now G¨odel went on to establish
that the axiom of choice and the generalized continuum hypothesis also hold in L,
because of the special nature of constructible sets; it follows that the negations of these
statements cannot be logical consequences of the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set the-
ory. In other words, the axiom of choice and the generalized continuum hypothesis are
consistent with Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, they cannot be disproved in that theory.
G¨odel’s work implies that a very strong form of the continuum hypothesis holds in
L—the set N of irrationals admits a wellordering of rank ℵ1 which is “∆1
2-good” in a
technical sense. We will make this proposition precise in 5A and we will abbreviate it
by “N ⊆L,” since it is in fact equivalent to the assertion that all points in Baire space
(as sets of ordered pairs of integers) are constructible. Thus the hypothesis N ⊆L is
also consistent with the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory and neither it nor any
of its logical consequences can be disproved from these axioms.
We will show that the hypothesis N ⊆L yields a complete structure theory for
the Lusin and Kleene pointclasses, e.g., it implies that all Σ1
n (n ≥2) are Spector
pointclasses with the uniformization property. It also implies that there are ∆
e
1
2 sets of
reals which are not Lebesgue measurable, that there are uncountable Π
e
1
1 sets which
have no perfect subset, etc. The consistency of N ⊆L implies then that all these
propositions are also consistent with the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (with
the axiom of choice), e.g., we cannot prove in this theory that some Σ
e
1
3 set cannot be
uniformized by a Σ
e
1
3 set or that every ∆
e
1
2 set of reals is Lebesgue measurable.
207

208
5. The constructible universe
[5A
It turns out that the proofs of these results from the hypothesis N ⊆L are quite
easy. The more diﬃcult metamathematical proof of the consistency of N ⊆L will be
given in full in Chapter 8.
At the end of this chapter we will also give a brief discussion (without proofs) of
various other consistency and independence results which illustrate the limitations of
classical, axiomatic set theory. These are proved by Cohen’s method of forcing which
we will not cover in this book.
Although the statements of theorems and the proofs in this chapter will be com-
pletely rigorous, the discussion will be necessarily somewhat vague since we will not
say exactly what we mean by “statements about sets” or “logical consequences.” These
are among the basic notions of logic and they will be deﬁned with complete preci-
sion in Chapter 8. The reader who feels uneasy about using these terms intuitively
may turn to that chapter now and peruse at least the ﬁrst few sections. Almost all of
Chapter 8 can be read at this point with no knowledge of the intervening Chapters 5, 6
and 7. However, only a rudimentary, intuitive understanding of these metamathemat-
ical notions is needed to read the material here, and it is perhaps best to continue in
our development of descriptive set theory before we turn to look seriously at logical
matters.
5A. Descriptive set theory in L(1)
Suppose ≤is a wellordering of some product space X and Γ is a pointclass. We say
that ≤is Γ-good if for every P ⊆Z × X in Γ the relations
Q(z, x) ⇐⇒(∃y ≤x)P(z, y),
R(z, x) ⇐⇒(∀y ≤x)P(z, y)
are also in Γ, i.e., if Γ is closed under ≤-bounded quantiﬁcation. For example, the
natural ordering on ù is Γ-good for every adequate pointclass Γ.
Notice that if Γ is adequate and the identity relation = on X is in ∆, then every
Γ-good wellordering of X is in ∆, since
z ≤x ⇐⇒(∃y ≤x)[z = y],
¬z ≤x ⇐⇒z ̸= x & x ≤z.
We now introduce the abbreviation
N ⊆L ⇐⇒N admits a Σ1
2-good wellordering of order type (rank) ℵ1;
put another way, N ⊆L asserts that there is a bijection
ñ : N ֌
→ℵ1
of Baire space with the set of countable ordinals such that the relation
α ≤L â ⇐⇒ñ(α) ≤ñ(â)
is a Σ1
2-good wellordering of N.
In particular, ≤L is a ∆1
2 pointset which well-
orders N.(2,3)
As we mentioned in the introduction, N admits a Σ1
2-good wellordering of rank ℵ1
exactly when every point of Baire space is in the collection L of constructible sets.
This motivates our choice of notation.

5A.2]
5A. Descriptive set theory in L
209
The hypothesis N ⊆L is almost certainly false on the basis of our intuitive un-
derstanding of the universe of sets. Not only does it imply the continuum hypothesis
2ℵ0 = ℵ1 which is itself dubious, it further asserts the existence of a deﬁnable, ∆1
2
wellordering of N, for which we have no evidence at all. It is well known that all
proofs of Zermelo’s theorem that N can be wellordered depend heavily on the axiom
of choice and fail to produce an explicit, deﬁnable wellordering.
The proof that the set of constructible irrationals admits a Σ1
2-good wellordering of
rank ℵ1 utilizes the very special properties of constructible sets.
Notice that by Corollary 2G.3 to the Kunen-Martin Theorem, N does not admit a
∆
e
1
1 wellordering. Thus the existence of a ∆1
2 wellordering is the strongest hypothesis
of this type which can be consistent with the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.
Exercises
We start with a few simple facts about good analytical wellorderings.
If ≤is a wellordering of N of rank ℵ1, put
IS(α, â) ⇐⇒{(α)i : i ∈ù} = {ã : ã ≤â};
we read this “α codes the initial segment of ≤with top â.”
5A.1. Let ≤be a wellordering of N of rank ℵ1. Prove that ≤is Σ1
n-good (n ≥2) if
and only if the associated relation IS(α, â) is ∆1
n.
Hint. Assume ﬁrst that ≤is Σ1
n-good. Compute:
IS(α, â) ⇐⇒(∀i)[(α)i ≤â] & (∀ã)

ã ≤â =⇒(∃i)[ã = (α)i]

⇐⇒(∀i)[(α)i ≤â] & (∀ã ≤â)(∃i)[(α)i = ã],
which implies that IS(α, â) is ∆1
n, since ≤is Σ1
n-good and in ∆1
n. Conversely, if IS(α, â)
is ∆1
n and P(ä, ã) is in Σ1
n, then
(∃ã ≤â)P(ä, ã) ⇐⇒(∃α)

5A.2. Prove that if N admits a Σ1
n-good wellordering of rank ℵ1, then every perfect
product space X admits a wellordering of rank ℵ1 which is Σ1
k-good, Π1
k-good and
∆1
k-good for every k ≥n.

If X is any perfect product space, let

Now

x <∗
ϕ y ⇐⇒(∃α){Q(x, α) & (∀â ≤L α)¬Q(y, â)},

⊣
We now consider the regularity properties of projective sets in L. The key construc-
tion is embodied in the following simple fact.
5A.6. Assume N ⊆L and let X, Y be any two perfect product spaces. Prove that
there exists a function f : X →Y whose graph
Graph(f) = {(x, y) : f(x) = y}
is Π1
1 and thin.
Hint. Let ≤L be a Σ1
2-good wellordering of N of rank ℵ1 and put
P(α, â) ⇐⇒α ≤L â & â ∈WO & (∀ã <L â)¬{ã ∈WO & |ã| = |â|},
where WO is the set of ordinal codes of 4A. Clearly P is Σ1
2, so let
P(α, â) ⇐⇒(∃ã)Q(α, â, ã)
with Q ∈Π1
1; considering Q as a subset of N × (N × N), let Q∗uniformize Q in Π1
1,
so that for each α,
(∃â)(∃ã)Q(α, â, ã) ⇐⇒(∃â)(∃ã)Q∗(α, â, ã),
Q∗(α, â, ã) & Q∗(α, â′, ã′) =⇒â = â′ & ã = ã′.
Use 4A.6 to show that Q∗has no non-empty perfect subsets—the key observation is
that any uncountable subset of Q∗involves uncountable many α’s and hence uncount-
ably many distinct ordinals |â| which form an unbounded subset of ℵ1.
Since Q∗is obviously the graph of a function
f : N →N × N,
this proves the result for X = N, Y = N × N, from which the general fact follows by
taking ∆1
1 isomorphisms and using 4F.7.

5. The constructible universe
[5A.7
In 8G.12 we will establish the converse of this result—the existence of a function
f : N →N with thin, Π1
1 graph in fact implies that N ⊆L.
Recall from 2H that a function f : X →Y is Baire-measurable if for each open
G ⊆Y, the inverse image f−1[G] has the property of Baire. Similarly f : X →Y is
ì-measurable (where ì is a ó-ﬁnite Borel measure on X) if f−1[G] is ì-measurable,
for each open G ⊆Y.
A measure ì on X is regular if ì(X) > 0 and ì({x}) = 0 for all x ∈X.
5A.7. Suppose f : X →Y and Graph(f) is thin; prove that f is not Baire-
measurable or ì-measurable for any regular ó-ﬁnite Borel measure on X.
Thus, if N ⊆L, then there are functions f : R →R with Π1
1 graphs which are
neither Baire-measurable nor Lebesgue-measurable.
Hint. By 2H.10, if f is Baire-measurable then there is a comeager Gä set P such
that f ↾P is continuous. Now P is uncountable, so the injective image
P∗= {
 x, f(x)

: x ∈P}
is also uncountable and a Σ
e
1
1 subset of Graph(f); but then P∗must have a perfect
subset by 2C.3, contradicting the hypothesis.
The argument for measure is similar.
⊣
5A.8 (G¨odel, Addison [1959b]). Prove that if N ⊆L, then each perfect product
space X has uncountable, thin Π1
1 subsets, it has ∆1
2 subsets without the property
of Baire and for each regular, ó-ﬁnite measure ì, it has ∆1
2 subsets which are not
ì-measurable.(1–3)
Hint. Take f : X →R as in 5A.6. For the ﬁrst assertion use a ∆1
1 isomorphism of X
with X ×R. For the second and third assertions argue that the set {x : p < f(x) < q}
is ∆1
2 for each pair of rationals p, q and that not all these sets can have the property of
Baire—or be ì-measurable.
⊣
There is another, simpler way of obtaining sets in L which are not measurable and
do not have the property of Baire, which depends on the classical theorems of Fubini
and Kuratowski-Ulam.
The Fubini Theorem asserts (in part) that if ì is a Borel measure on X and if
A ⊆X × X is measurable in the product measure ì × ì, then
(i) the section
Ay = {x : A(x, y)}
is ì-measurable, for almost all y ∈X,
(ii) if ì(Ay) = 0 for almost all y ∈X, then A has measure 0 in the product measure
and the section
Ax = {y : A(x, y)}
has measure 0, for almost all x ∈X.
We will not prove this here.
The corresponding result for category is not as well-known and it is worth putting
it down for the record.
5A.9 (The Kuratowski-Ulam Theorem, see Oxtoby [1971]). Prove that if a set A ⊆
X ×Y has the property of Baire, then the section Ay = {x : A(x, y)} has the property

5A.10]
5A. Descriptive set theory in L
213
of Baire for a comeager set of y’s and
A is meager ⇐⇒Ay is meager for a comeager set of y’s
⇐⇒Ax = {y : A(x, y)} is meager for a comeager set of x’s.
Hint. Suppose ﬁrst that A ⊆X ×Y is closed and nowhere dense, let G = X ×Y \A,
so G is dense and open. For each basic nbhd Ns ⊆X, put
Gs = {y : (∃x ∈Ns)G(x, y)}
and check that each Gs is dense, open in Y; hence by the deﬁnition
H = T
s Gs ⊆Y
is comeager. Now if y ∈H, then easily Gy = {x : G(x, y)} is dense and hence
Ay = X \ Gy is nowhere dense.
Thus whenever A is closed and nowhere dense, the section Ay is nowhere dense for
a comeager set of y’s. This implies immediately that if A is meager, then Ay is meager
for a comeager set of y’s, which yields direction (=⇒) of the second assertion.
To prove the ﬁrst assertion, choose an open G and a meager set P such that
A △G = P and notice that for each y, Ay △Gy = Py; since each Gy is open, this
proves that Ay has the property of Baire whenever Py is meager, which is true for a
comeager set of y’s.
Finally, to prove direction (⇐=) of the second assertion, suppose A △G is meager
with G open and A is not meager, so that G ̸= ∅; now Ay △Gy is meager for a
comeager set of y’s and if the same were true for Ay, it would follow that Gy is meager
for a comeager set of y’s. But G contains a basic nbhd of the form N(X, s) × N(Y, t)
since it is non-empty and Gy is not meager for y ∈N(Y, t), which implies that N(Y, t)
is contained in a meager set, contradicting the Baire Category Theorem.
⊣
5A.10. Suppose ñ : X →Ordinals maps a perfect product space X into the ordinals
so that for each î, the set ñ−1(î) = {x : ñ(x) = î} is meager; prove that the
prewellordering ≤induced by ñ does not have the property of Baire (as a subset of
X × X).
Similarly, if each ñ−1(î) has ì-measure 0 for some regular Borel measure Γ, then
≤is not measurable in the product measure ì × ì.
In particular, both conclusions hold if each ñ−1(î) is countable or a singleton (i.e.,
if ≤is a wellordering).
Hint. Let A = {(x, y) : ñ(x) ≤ñ(y)} and suppose ﬁrst that the set {y :
Ay is meager} is not comeager; choose then a least y0 such that Ay0 has the prop-
erty of Baire but is not meager, put
B = {(x, y) : ñ(x) ≤ñ(y) < ñ(y0)}
and verify easily that B has the property of Baire. Now By is meager for a comeager
set of y’s by the choice of y0, hence B is meager. On the other hand, for each x ≤y0,
Bx = {y : ñ(x) ≤ñ(y) < ñ(y0)} so that
Ay0 ⊆Bx ∪Bx ∪{y : ñ(y) = ñ(y0)}
and hence Bx cannot be meager or else Ay0 would be meager.
The argument is a bit simpler if {y : Ay is meager} is comeager and the whole proof
goes through word-for-word for the case of measure.

5B. Independence results obtained by the method of forcing(4)
If we can prove a certain statement è about sets from the hypothesis N ⊆L,
then we know that è is consistent with the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory
(with choice)—it cannot be disproved from these axioms. This is a particularly nice
consistency proof for è, as it establishes that è actually holds in a very natural model
of set theory, namely L.
The ingenious method of forcing was invented by Cohen in order to prove the
independence of the axiom of choice from the remaining Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms
as well as the independence of the continuum hypothesis in Zermelo-Fraenkel set
theory with choice. This involves constructing models of set theory which are more
complicated (and less natural) than L. We will not attempt to explain forcing here,
but we will simply list a few of the results which are proved using it and which are
relevant to descriptive set theory.
By ZFC we understand the classical Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, with the axiom
of choice. (The speciﬁc axioms are listed in Chapter 8.) In stating consistency results,
it is natural to assume that ZFC itself is consistent—this is surely true since all its
axioms hold in its intended model, the universe of sets. We will not bother to make
this hypothesis explicit.
5B.1. Theorem (Cohen, Levy). We cannot prove in ZFC that N admits a projective
wellordering; in particular, we cannot prove in ZFC that N ⊆L.
An extension of this result asserts that the uniformization problem for the higher
Lusin pointclasses is hopeless in ZFC.
5B.2. Theorem (Levy [1965]). We cannot prove in ZFC that every Π1
2 set in N × N
can be uniformized by some projective set.
Even weaker structure properties cannot be proved.
5B.3. Theorem (Harrington). We cannot prove in ZFC that either Σ
e
1
3 or Π
e
1
3 has
the separation property; hence, we cannot prove in ZFC that either Π
e
1
3 or Σ
e
1
3 has the
prewellordering property.
Martin’s Theorem 2G.4 is also best possible in ZFC—it cannot be extended to the
higher Lusin pointclasses. Sample result of this type:
5B.4. Theorem (Harrington [1977]). We may assume consistently with ZFC that
2ℵ0 = ℵ17 and that there are Π1
2 wellfounded relations on N of rank ℵ17.
Similarly, Sierpinski’s Theorem 2F.3 cannot be extended:

5C]
5C. Historical remarks
215
5B.5. Theorem (Solovay). We may assume consistently with ZFC that 2ℵ0 = ℵ17
and that there is a Π1
2 set A which cannot be written as the union of fewer than ℵ17 Borel
sets.
The best result about regularity properties of projective sets needs the additional
hypothesis that the existence of inaccessible cardinals is consistent—see Section 6G
for a deﬁnition of these. In the present context this is surely a reasonable assumption.
5B.6. Theorem (Solovay [1970]). If the theory ZFC+ (there exist inaccessible car-
dinals) is consistent, then the following statements (taken together) are consistent
with ZFC.
(i) Every uncountable projective set has a perfect subset.
(ii) Every projective set has the property of Baire.
(iii) Every projective set is ì-measurable, for every ó-ﬁnite Borel measure ì.
(iv) There is no projective wellordering of the continuum.
Moreover, one may consistently assume (i)–(iv) together with either the continuum
hypothesis or its negation.
We will say something about the proofs of these results in Chapter 8, after we
have studied the metamathematical method. Suﬃce it to say here that they are deep
and intricate arguments which involve a detailed analysis of both set theory and the
“axiomatic method.”
5C. Historical remarks
1The results in 5A are all due basically to G¨odel, except for some of the reﬁnements
and generalizations.
2G¨odel [1938] proved that the collection L of constructible sets is a model of
Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory which further satisﬁes the axiom of choice and the gener-
alized continuum hypothesis. He also announced there without proof that in L there
are non-Lebesgue measurable ∆
e
1
2 sets and uncountable Π
e
1
1 sets with no perfect sub-
sets. In the later, second printing of the monograph G¨odel [1940] (which apparently
appeared in 1951) he also added a note announcing that in L, the set N admits a Σ
e
1
2
wellordering.
3Addison [1959b] formulated the notion of a Σ
e
1
2-good wellordering of rank ℵ1 and
gave the ﬁrst published proof that L ∩N admits such a wellordering. He also derived
most of the corollaries of this proposition that we have listed here, including the
uniformization and basis results 5A.4 as well as 5A.8. According to his introduction
in [1959b], Addison was building on earlier papers of Kuratowski and Novikov and
on some very early, unpublished work of Mostowski.
4For the results using forcing which we will not cover here, we refer the reader to
Jech [1971] and Kunen [1980].


CHAPTER 6
THE PLAYFUL UNIVERSE
The results of Chapter 5 witness clearly the basic inadequacy of the Zermelo-Fraenkel
axioms for descriptive set theory. It is simply impossible to extend the classical results
about Π1
1 and Σ1
2 to the higher Lusin and Kleene pointclasses on the basis of ZFC.
One way to go, at this point, would be to adopt the hypothesis N ⊆L as an
additional axiom of set theory. As we saw, this gives (almost trivially) a complete
structure theory for projective sets. The defect of this approach is that there is not
much evidence in favor of the hypothesis N ⊆L, and many set theorists tend to believe
that it is false.
Another possibility is to give up developing a theory for the higher Lusin pointclasses
and concentrate on consistency and independence results. Many logicians do this, but
it is not our approach here.
Instead, we will study hypotheses which go beyond ZFC, which yield a rich theory
of projective sets and which appear to be (at least) plausible. We should caution the
reader that this “plausibility” will not be obvious on ﬁrst reading; evidence for it will
ﬂow (we claim) precisely from the results which we will prove in this chapter.
Solovay [1969] was ﬁrst to use strong set theoretic hypotheses (unprovable in ZFC
and inconsistent with N ⊆L) to solve problems in descriptive set theory. Speciﬁcally,
he assumed that there exist measurable cardinals (MC); granting this, he proved that
every Σ
e
1
2 pointset has the property of Baire, is measurable relative to every ó-ﬁnite
Borel measure and is either countable or has a non-empty perfect subset.
We will deﬁne measurable cardinals and prove Solovay’s results in Section 6G.
Before this, however, we will study another strong hypothesis which yields a rich
structure theory for projective sets. Besides its power, this hypothesis also has some
advantages over MC because it is simpler to state and easier to use.
This is where games come in: the hypothesis of projective determinacy (PD) asserts
that in certain two-person, inﬁnite games of perfect information, one of the two players
must have a winning strategy. We will give precise deﬁnitions of these notions in
Section 6A.
There is no doubt that this introduction of powerful and unfamiliar hypotheses
poses serious foundational questions.
Our discussion of these problems here will
be somewhat vague and tentative; we will come back to them ( better equipped) in
Chapter 8. In the meantime, the reader who wants to go beyond the classical theory of
the ﬁrst four chapters should put aside his doubts about our approach, open himself
to new ideas and plunge into the mathematics of the subject. If he can do this, he will
be amply rewarded.

6A. Inﬁnite games of perfect information(1,2)
Let X be a ﬁxed non-empty set. With each set A ⊆ùX of inﬁnite sequences from X,
we associate a two-person game G = GX (A) as follows. Players I and II alternatively
choose members of X ad inﬁnitum, as in Diagram 6A.1, so that a sequence
f = (a0, a1, a2, . . . ) ∈ùX
is speciﬁed; I wins if f ∈A, otherwise II wins.

Diagram 6A.1. Playing the game.
It is understood here that before I chooses an (for n even) he is allowed to see
a0, a1, . . . , an−1, and similarly with II. This is why we call these games of perfect
information.
We have described a run of the game G which resulted in a particular play f. The
set A is the payoﬀfor GX (A), but we will often identify A with GX(A) and talk of the
game A.
A strategy for player I is any function ó with domain all ﬁnite sequences from X of
even length (including the empty sequence) and values in X. We say that I follows (or
plays) ó in a run of the game G, if the resulting play
f = (a0, a1, a2, . . . )
satisﬁes
a0 = ó(∅),
a2 = ó(a0, a1),
· · ·
an = ó(a0, a1, . . . , an−1)
(n even).
Dually, a strategy for player II is any function ô on the ﬁnite sequences from X of odd
length, with values in X.
When I plays ó against II’s ô, the resulting play
ó ∗ô = (a0, a1, a2, . . . )
is completely speciﬁed,
a0 = ó(∅),
a1 = ô(a0),
an = ó(a0, . . . , an−1)
(n even),
an = ô(a0, . . . , an−1)
(n odd).
We naturally call ó a winning strategy for I if for every ô, ó ∗ô ∈A—i.e., if I always
wins when he plays ó, no matter what II plays; dually ô is winning for II if for every ó,
ó ∗ô /∈A.
Finally, the game G = GX (A) (or the set A) is determined if either I or II has a
winning strategy—or wins the game, as we will say.

6A.2]
6A. Inﬁnite games of perfect information
219
Not all games are determined, but simple ones are. The ﬁrst result of this type is
fundamental for the subject.
First a deﬁnition: if A ⊆ùX and u = (a0, . . . , an−1) is a sequence of even length,
the subgame of A at u is
A(u) =

f ∈ùX :
 a0, a1, . . . , an−1, f(0), f(1), . . .

∈A
	
.
6A.1. Lemma (AC). Let A ⊆ùX and suppose u = (a0, a1, . . . , an−1) is a ﬁnite
sequence from X of even length. If II does not win the game A(u), then there is some a
such that for all b, II does not win A
 ub(a, b)

.
Proof. Towards a contradiction, suppose II does not win A(u), but that for each
a, there is some b and a strategy ô which is winning for II in A
 ub(a, b)

. Using the
axiom of choice, let
a 7→(ba, ôa)
be a function which assigns to each a some ba and ôa with these properties. Now
II can win A(u) by answering I’s ﬁrst move a0 by ba0 and then following ôa0, as if he
were playing in A
 ub(a0, ba0)

.
In more detail, deﬁne ô by
ô(a0) = ba0,
ô(a0, . . . , an−1) = ôa0(a2, . . . , an−1)
(odd n)
and suppose that I plays f = (a0, a1, . . . ) in A(u) while II responds by ô. Then
(a2, a3, . . . ) /∈A
 ub(a0, a1)

, since II has been following ôa0 after the ﬁrst two moves
hence (a0, a1, a2, . . . ) /∈A(u), i.e., II has won this run of A(u).
⊣
We will customarily describe in an informal way how I or II can play to win a certain
game, as in the ﬁrst paragraph of this proof, without bothering to deﬁne formally a
winning strategy.
6A.2. The Gale-Stewart Theorem (AC, Gale and Stewart [1953]).
For each
X ̸= ∅, every closed subset of ùX is determined.
Proof. Of course we use the product topology on ùX (with X discrete) as in
Chapter 2.
Suppose then that A ⊆ùX and II does not have a winning strategy in A. We
describe how I can play to win.
By the lemma, there is some a0 such that for every b, II cannot win the subgame
A(a0, b); let I start the game by playing some a0 with this property and suppose
II answers by some a1. Now II cannot win A(a0, a1).
By the lemma again, there is some a2 such that for every b, II cannot win the
subgame A(a0, a1, a2, b); let I play one such a2 and continue in the same fashion.
At the end of this run of the game, we have a play
f = (a0, a1, a2, . . . )
and for every even n, II cannot win A(a0, . . . , an−1). This implies that there is some
fn ∈ùX with
fn(0) = a0, . . . , fn(n −1) = an−1,
fn ∈A,
otherwise II could win A(a0, . . . , an−1) by moving randomly. Now limn→∞fn = f,
and hence f ∈A, since A is closed, so that I has won.

6. The playful universe
[6A.3
Proofs of determinacy can become very complicated, but their basic idea is always
the same: to reduce in some way the problem of winning a given game to winning
various associated closed games. We give here one more proof of this type.
First extend to all spaces ùX (X ̸= ∅) the basic deﬁnitions for the Borel subsets of
ùù = N:
Σ
e
0
1 = all open subsets of ùX,
Π
e
0
î = {ùX \ A : A ∈Σ
e
0
î},
and for î > 1,
A ∈Σ
e
0
î ⇐⇒A = S
i∈ù Ai for suitable A0, A1, . . .
where each Ai is in Π
e
0
ç for some ç < î.
The Borel subsets of ùX are the sets which occur in some Σ
e
0
î or Π
e
0
î—they obviously
form the smallest collection of subsets of ùX which contains the open sets and is closed
under complementation and countable union.
Most of the trivial results about the Borel subsets of N extend to the Borel subsets
of ùX, but one must be careful; if X is uncountable, then ùX is not separable and
theorems which depend on the separability of N must fail. (For example, it is not
always the case that open sets are countable unions of closed sets.)
6A.3. Theorem (AC, Wolfe [1955]). For each X ̸= ∅, every Σ
e
0
2 subset of ùX is de-
termined.
Proof. Suppose
A = S
i∈ù Fi
with each Fi closed and by 2C.1 choose trees T i on X such that
Fi = [T i] =

f ∈ùX : (∀k)
 f(0), . . . , f(k −1)

∈T i	
.
The idea of the proof is to deﬁne a set of sure winning positions for I in A, i.e., a set
W of sequences from X such that I wins A(u) in a particularly obvious way, if u ∈W .
We will subsequently show that if ∅/∈W , then in fact II wins A, thus establishing the
determinacy of A.
Put ﬁrst
u ∈W 0 ⇐⇒(∃i)[I wins F i(u)];
if u ∈W 0, then I wins A(u) almost trivially, by playing to get into a speciﬁc closed
set Fi.
Suppose now that W ç has been deﬁned for each ç < î and for i ∈ù put
f ∈H î,i ⇐⇒(∀even k)
 f(0), . . . , f(k −1)

ç<î W ç ∪T i
;
clearly H î,i is a closed set. Let
u ∈W î ⇐⇒(∃i)[I wins the game H î,i(u)]
and
W = S
î W î.
We now prove by induction on î that
u ∈W î =⇒I wins A(u).

Granting (∗) for all ç < î and assuming that u ∈W î, choose i so that I wins
H î,i(u) and let I play in A(u) following this winning strategy in H î,i(u). As the game
progresses, if c0, . . . , ck−1 have been played after k steps, we know that
ub(c0, . . . , ck−1) ∈S
ç<î W ç ∪T i.
Case 1. For some k, we actually have
ub(c0, . . . , ck−1) ∈S
ç<î W ç.
By the induction hypothesis then I can switch to a strategy which will produce from then
on some f ∈A
 ub(c0, . . . , ck−1)

, so thatthe whole play
 c0, . . . , ck−1, f(0), f(1), . . .

is in A(u) and I has won.
Case 2. For every k, ub(c0, . . . , ck−1) /∈S
ç<î W ç.. Now the play f = (c0, c1, . . . )
satisﬁes
(∀k)[ub(c0, c1, . . . , ck−1) ∈T i]
so that ub
 f(0), f(1), . . .

∈[T i] = F i and f ∈F i(u) ⊆A(u), so that again I has
won A(u).
In particular, (∗) implies that
∅∈W =⇒I wins A.
To show that if ∅/∈W , then II wins A, notice ﬁrst that for each i,
ç ≤î =⇒H ç,i ⊆H î,i,
and hence trivially
ç ≤î =⇒W ç ⊆W î.
Since the sequence W î (î an ordinal) cannot increase for ever, there is some ordinal
κ such that
W κ+1 = W κ = W.
Suppose now that ∅/∈W κ+1. We describe how II can play to win A.
By the deﬁnition of W κ+1 and the determinacy of each closed game H κ+1,i, II can
actually win every H κ,i. Let him start by playing to win H κ,0; after a while then, a
ﬁnite sequence (c0, . . . , ck−1) has been played and
(c0, . . . , ck−1) /∈W κ & (c0, . . . , ck−1) /∈T 0;
no matter how the game continues, we know at this stage that the ﬁnal play will not
be in F 0.
Let k0 be the ﬁrst k at which this happens and using W κ = W κ+1, let II switch to a
strategy so he can win H κ+1,1(c0, . . . , ck0−1); again, some k > k0 is reached so that
(c0, . . . , ck0−1, ck0, . . . , ck−1) /∈W κ & (c0, . . . , ck−1) /∈T 1.
At this point we have insured that the ﬁnal play will not be in F 1.
Clearly II can continue to play in this manner and guarantee that the ﬁnal play will
not be in any of the sets F 0, F 1, F 2, . . . thereby winning A.
⊣
If Λ is a collection of sets, put
DetX (Λ) ⇐⇒for every set A ⊆ùX in Λ,
the game GX(A) is determined.
We will be particularly interested in the hypotheses Detù(Λ) and Det2(Λ), with Λ one
of the pointclasses we have been studying.

222
6. The playful universe
[6A.4
Thus far we have shown DetX (Σ
e
0
2), for every X. The determinacy of the dual class
follows from the following trivial result.
6A.4. Theorem. Suppose Λ is a collection of subsets of some ùX which is closed under
continuous substitution; then
DetX (Λ) ⇐⇒DetX (¬Λ).
If X = ù or X = 2, then closure under recursive substitution is a suﬃcient hypothesis.
Proof. Given A ⊆ùX in Λ, let
B =
 x, f(0), f(1), . . .

: x ∈X, f ∈A
	
and verify easily that
I wins B =⇒II wins ùX \ A,
II wins B =⇒I wins ùX \ A,
so that if B is determined, A must be determined too.
⊣
6A.5. Corollary. For each X, DetX (Π
e
0
2).
Martin has shown that all Borel games are determined—we will prove this in Sec-
tion 6F. For the moment we consider the signiﬁcance for descriptive set theory of
some speciﬁc types of games. The main content of the exercises below is that for
adequate Λ closed under Borel substitution, Detù(Λ) implies that all sets in Λ have
the property of Baire, they are absolutely measurable and if uncountable, they have
non-empty perfect subsets.
Exercises
Let us ﬁrst put down for the record that not every set is determined.
6A.6 (AC). Prove that there is a set A ⊆ù2 which is not determined. (Gale and
Stewart [1953].)
Hint. Notice that there are 2ℵ0 possible strategies for player I (and also player II)
on 2 = {0, 1} and choose wellorderings {αî}, {óî}, {ôî} of rank 2ℵ0 for the set C of
binary sequences and the sets of strategies for I and II respectively. Now deﬁne by
induction sets Aî, Bî such that for î < 2ℵ0,
Aî ∩Bî = ∅
card(Aî) < 2ℵ0,
card(Bî) < 2ℵ0
(∃ô)[óî ∗ô ∈Bî]
(∃ó)[ó ∗ôî ∈Aî]
and take A = S
î Aî.
⊣
The proof of course depends on a blatant application of the axiom of choice. No
one has been able to prove without using the axiom of choice that there exist non
determined games on ù or 2; neither has anyone deﬁned a speciﬁc set A ⊆ù2 or
A ⊆ùù and then proved (in ZFC) that A is not determined.
It is often easier to study games on 2 instead of games on ù, but there is little
diﬀerence in the results.

223
6A.7. Prove that if Λ is a pointclass closed under recursive substitution, then
Detù(Λ) =⇒Det2(Λ).
Hint. Given A ⊆ù2 in Λ, deﬁne g : N →C by
g(α)(n) =
(
0
if α(n) = 0
1
if α(n) > 0,
let
α ∈B ⇐⇒g(α) ∈A
and show that the player who wins B (playing on ù) also wins A (playing on 2).
⊣
The converse implication is a bit awkward to state but it makes the point.
6A.8. Prove that there is an operation
A 7→H(A)
which takes subsets of ùù into subsets of ù2 such that the following hold.
(i) If Λ is closed under H, then
Det2(Λ) =⇒Detù(Λ).
(ii) Σ0
n, Π0
n, ∆0
n and the corresponding boldface pointclasses are closed under H, if
n ≥3.
(iii) If Λ is adequate, Λ ⊇Π0
2 and Λ is closed under ∆1
1 substitution, then Λ is closed
under H; in particular this holds if Λ is Σ1
n, Π1
n, ∆1
n, etc.
Hint. The idea is to simulate games on ù by games on 2.
Think of a sequence α as the play in some game on ù, where α(0), α(2), α(4), . . .
are contributed by I and α(1), α(3), α(5), . . . are contributed by II; we will code this
by a play h(α) of an associated game on 2 which looks like this:
h(α) = (1, II, 1, II, . . . , 1, II
|
{z
}
α(0) 1’s
, 0, 1, I, 1, I, . . . , 1, I
|
{z
}
α(1) 1’s
, 0, 1, II, 1, II, . . . , 1, II
|
{z
}
α(2) 1’s
, 0, . . . ).
(Here I stands for arbitrary digits played by I and similarly for II.) Call sequences of
this form good and give a precise Π0
2 deﬁnition of goodness. Notice also that if â fails
to be good, this is because one of the players ﬁrst gives inﬁnitely many 1’s when it is
his turn to code an integer by playing ﬁnitely many 1’s and then a 0. For each A ⊆ùù
and α ∈ù2, put then
α ∈H(A) ⇐⇒α is not good on account of II
or α is good and h−1(α) ∈A.
It is easy to verify that whichever player wins H(A) also wins A, so we have proved (i).
(ii) is immediate, since h is recursive and hence the inverse function h−1 (= (t 7→0)
on bad arguments) is ∆1
1.
To prove (iii), check ﬁrst that there is a recursive relation Q(u, α, t) such that
whenever α is good,
Q(u, α, t) ⇐⇒(∃â){h(â) = α & â(t) = u}.
Suppose now that A is in Π0
3, so that
α ∈A ⇐⇒(∀n)(∃m)(∀t)R

α ∈H(A) ⇐⇒α is not good on account of II or
α is good & (∀n)(∃m)(∀t)(∀u){Q(u, α, t) =⇒R(u, n, m)}.
The argument is similar for the other pointclasses involved.
⊣
We now consider some special games which have topological or measure-theoretic
signiﬁcance.
Given A ⊆ùX, the game G∗
X (A) is played as follows (see Diagram 6A.2): I chooses
a ﬁnite (non-empty) sequence from X, then II chooses a single member from X, then
I chooses a ﬁnite (non-empty) sequence from X, etc. ad inﬁnitum. I wins if the play
f = (a0, a1, . . . )
is in A, otherwise II wins.(5)
In this game I is favored, since he is allowed to play more than one point from X if
he wishes; in particular, if I wins GX (A), he obviously wins G∗
X (A) too.
Strategies and winning strategies for these games are deﬁned in the obvious way.
We put
Det∗
X (Λ) ⇐⇒for each A ⊆ùX is Λ, either I or II wins the game G∗
X (A).
Let us ﬁrst notice the obvious.
6A.9. Prove that if Λ is a pointclass closed under recursive substitution, then
Detù(Λ) =⇒Det∗
ù(Λ) =⇒Det∗
2(Λ).
Hint. For the ﬁrst implication, associate with each A ⊆ùù the set

and check that the player who wins B also wins A.
The second implication is proved by the method of 6A.7.
⊣
The topological signiﬁcance of the ∗-game is evidenced in the next two results.
6A.10 (Davis [1964]). Prove that I has a winning strategy for G∗
2 (A) if and only if
A ⊆ù2 has a non-empty, perfect subset.
Hint. If ó is a winning strategy for I, then the set
B
=
{α
∈
ù2
:
α is the play in some run of G∗(A), where I plays by ó}
is easily a perfect subset of A.
Conversely, if C is a perfect subset of A, choose
a tree T on 2 such that C = [T] =

α : (∀n)
 α(0), . . . , α(n −1)


and
have I start playing in G∗
2 (A) by moving some (a0, . . . , an−1) ∈T such that both
(a0, . . . , an−1, 0) and (a0, . . . , an−1, 1) are in T; such a sequence exists, otherwise C
would be a singleton. No matter what II moves, have I play (an+1, . . . , ak−1) such that,

6A.12]
6A. Inﬁnite games of perfect information
225
with u = (a0, . . . , an−1, an, an+1, . . . , ak−1), both ub(0) and ub(1) are in T, which is
always possible, since [T] is perfect.
⊣
6A.11 (Davis [1964]). Prove that II has a winning strategy in G∗
2 (A) is and only if
A is countable.
Hint. If A is countable, then II has an obvious winning strategy—he simply plays
in his n’th turn to make the play diﬀerent from αn, where A = {α0, α1, . . . }.
Suppose now that II wins via ô and let α be a ﬁxed binary sequence. Call a sequence
s0, k0, s1, k1, . . . , sl−1, kl−1
good (for ô and α) if each si is a non-empty, ﬁnite binary sequence, each ki is 0 or 1,
the sequence
w = s0b(k0)bs1b(k1)b· · · sl−1b(kl−1)
is an initial segment of α, and s0, k0, . . . , sl−1, kl−1 is the beginning of a run of G∗
2 (A)
played according to ô, i.e., for j < l,
kj = ô(s0, k0, . . . , sj);
the empty sequence (l = 0, by convention) is automatically good. If every good
sequence has a good proper extension, then α is the play in a run of G∗
2 (A) where II has
followed ô, and hence α /∈A; thus if α ∈A, there must exist some s0, k0, . . . , sl−1, kl−1
(possibly the empty sequence) which is good for ô and α and has no proper, good
extension. If
s0b(k0)b. . . sl−1b(kl−1) = α(0), α(1), . . . , α(n −1),
then, easily, for i > n we must have
α(i) = 1 −ô

s0, k0, . . . , sl−1, kl−1,
 α(n), . . . , α(n −i)

,
and so α is completely determined (recursively) by the value α(n) and the maximal
good sequence s0, k0, . . . , sl−1, kl−1. Since there are only countably many possible
good sequences, A must be countable.
⊣
From these two simple facts we obtain the ﬁrst connection between determinacy
hypotheses and structural properties of pointsets.
6A.12. Prove that if Λ is an adequate pointclass closed under ∆1
1 substitution, then
Det∗
2(Λ) ⇐⇒every uncountable pointset in Λ has a non-empty
perfect subset

that ð[A] has a perfect subset ð[C] and argue that the uncountable Borel set C ⊆A
has a perfect subset.
The other assertions follow immediately using 6A.9, 5A.8 and 6A.4.

The next game we will study can be used to prove that determinacy implies the Baire
property. It is easier here to work directly on arbitrary pointsets rather than prove the
result for subsets of ù2 and then transfer it.
Given A ⊆X, the ∗∗-game or Banach-Mazur game) G∗∗= G∗∗(A) is played as fol-
lows: I chooses an integer s0, II chooses s1, I chooses s2, and so on. If N(0), N(1), . . .

si such that (see Figure 6A.3)

—otherwise the ﬁrst player who does not follow this restriction loses. If they both
follow the restriction, at the end they have deﬁned a point x, the unique point in all
the N(si); now I wins if x ∈A, otherwise II wins.(1)
6A.13. Prove that if Λ is adequate and closed under ∆1
1 substitution, then
Detù(Λ) =⇒for each A ∈Λ, G∗∗(A) is determined.
Hint. The payoﬀset A∗∗⊆ùù for G∗∗(A) is easily in Λ.
⊣
6A.14 (Banach, see Oxtoby [1957].(1)). Prove that for a ﬁxed A ⊆X,
(i) II wins G∗∗(A) ⇐⇒A is meager,
(ii) I wins G∗∗(A) ⇐⇒for some s, N(s) \ A is meager.
Hint. (i) If A is meager, then A ⊆S
n Fn with each Fn closed and having no interior.
If I plays s0, have II play s1 such that the restrictions are satisﬁed and N(s1) ∩F0 = ∅,
and in general let II play so that N(s2n+1) ∩Fn = ∅; then the point x determined at
the end will not be in A.
Suppose now that II wins G∗∗(A) via some strategy ó and let x ∈X. Call a sequence
s0, . . . , sn of even length good if it is the initial part of some play in G∗∗(A), where the
restrictions have been followed, II plays by ó and x ∈N(sn)—the empty sequence is
good by deﬁnition. If every good sequence has a good extension, then (easily) x is the
point determined by some play where II plays ó, hence x /∈A; thus
x ∈A =⇒some s0, . . . , sn is maximal good (for x).

each B(s0, . . . , sn) is easily closed and nowhere dense and we have shown
x ∈A =⇒for some s0, . . . , sn, x ∈B(s0, . . . , sn)

(ii) suppose I wins G∗∗(A) via a strategy ó whose ﬁrst move is s = s0; it is now
easy to check that II wins the game G∗∗ N(s) \ A

by following ó, so that N(s) \ A
is meager by (i). Conversely, if N(s) \ A is meager for some s, then I can easily win
G∗∗(A) by playing s to begin with and then staying out of N(s) \ A as in the ﬁrst part
of the argument above.

1 ⊆Λ, and for each A in Λ, either A is meager or
there is a nbhd N(s) such that N(s) \ A is meager. Prove that every pointset in Λ has
the property of Baire.
Hint. Given A in Λ, let
A∗= ∪{N(s) : N(s) \ A is meager};
A∗is open so it is enough to show that A △A∗is meager.
To begin with, A∗\ A ⊆∪{N(s) \ A : N(s) \ A is meager}, so A∗\ A is meager.
If A \ A∗is not meager, since A \ A∗∈Λ by the hypotheses, there must be some
s such that N(s) \ (A \ A∗) is meager. Clearly then the smaller set N(s) \ A is also
meager so that N(s) ⊆A∗by the deﬁnition of A∗and easily N(s) \ (A \ A∗) ⊇N(s);
thus N(s) is meager, contradicting the Baire Category Theorem.

following two conditions are equivalent:
(i) For each A ∈Λ, G∗∗(A) is determined.
(ii) Every pointset in Λ has the property of Baire.
Hence for such Λ,(6,7)
Detù(Λ) =⇒every pointset in Λ has the property of Baire.
Hint. One direction is immediate from 6A.14 and 6A.15. For the other direction,
check easily that if A has the property of Baire, then in fact either A is meager or some
N(s) \ A is meager.

Let us now go to ó-ﬁnite Borel measures or simply measures for this discussion.
The deﬁnitions are given in 2H.
First recall a few simple facts.
If ì is a measure on the Borel subsets of X, then for each Borel P ⊆X,
ð(P) = inﬁmum{ì(G) : G is open, P ⊆G}.
This is immediate for open P and follows for closed P because closed sets are countable
intersections of open sets. Inductively, if P = S
n Pn and for each n, Pn ⊆Gn with
ì(Gn \ Pn) < ε/2n, then P ⊆G = S
n Gn and ì(P \ G) = ì(S
n Gn \ S
n Pn) ≤
P
n ì(Gn \Pn) ≤ε. The argument is even simpler when P = T
n Pn with Pn of smaller
Borel order.

Diagram 6A.4. The covering game Gì(A, ε).
It follows that ì(P) = 0 precisely when we can ﬁnd for each ε > 0 an open set
G ⊇P with ì(G) ≤ε.
We now describe the covering game Gì(A, ε) associated with the measure ì on the
space ù2 and each set A ⊆ù2. This is a game on ù, invented by Harrington.
Player I plays integers s0, s1, s2, . . . , with each si = 0 or si = 1. Thus he determines
at the end a binary sequence α ∈ù2.
Player II plays integers t0, t1, . . . where each tn codes in some canonical way a ﬁnite
union of basic open sets Gn, such that
ì(Gn) ≤ε/22n+2.
For example, we may insist that Seq(tn) and
Gn = N

.
Here ε > 0 is ﬁxed and if II does not play the right kind of tn he loses. The moves are
made in the obvious order, as in Diagram 6A.4.
If II follows the rules, at the end he deﬁnes an open set
G = S
n Gn,
and we set
I wins ⇐⇒α ∈A \ G.
6A.17. Suppose ì is a ó-ﬁnite Borel measure on ù2, A ⊆ù2 has no Borel subsets
of ì-measure > 0 and for each ε > 0 the game Gì(A, ε) is determined. Prove that
ì(A) = 0.
Hint. Suppose ﬁrst I wins Gì(A, ε) via ó and let
B = {ó ∗ô : ô is a strategy for II}.
Now B is a Σ
e
1
1 subset of A, so it is ì-measurable by 2H.8 and then easily ì(B) = 0,
since B ⊆A. We can easily ﬁnd G0, G1, G2, . . . all ﬁnite unions of basic nbhds with
ì(Gn) ≤ε/22n+2 and B ⊆S
n Gn, which determines a strategy for II that beats ó
contrary to hypothesis. Thus I cannot win Gì(A, ε).
It follows that II wins, say by ô. Put
G = S{G(s0, . . . , sn) : (s0, . . . , sn) is a ﬁnite binary sequence
and G(s0, . . . , sn) is the ﬁnite union of basic nbhds
coded by II’s move tn (playing by ô) when I plays s0, . . . , sn}.

Hint. Suppose ﬁrst X = ù2, let A ⊆X. By 2H.7 there is a Borel set ˜A such that
A ⊆
˜A and ˜A \ A contains no Borel set of ì-measure > 0. Let B =
˜A \ A; clearly
B is in the dual class ¬Λ. The game Gì(B, ε) is easily in ¬Λ, hence it is determined
by 6A.4; by 6A.17, ì(B) = 0, so A is ì-measurable.
Every perfect space X is Borel isomorphic with ù2 and we can establish the result
for X by carrying to ù2 any given measure on X.
⊣
6B. The First Periodicity Theorem
We saw in 6A that if Λ is a reasonable pointclass, then the hypothesis Detù(Λ)
implies that all the sets in Λ are “nice”: they have the property of Baire, they are
absolutely measurable and they are uncountable precisely when they have perfect
subsets. Put
PD ⇐⇒every projective set A ⊆N is determined;
this hypothesis of projective determinacy implies then that all projective sets are nice
in this sense.
In this section we will show that if PD holds, then the prewellordering property
oscillates between the Σ and the Π sides of the analytical hierarchy, i.e., the normed
analytical pointclasses are those circled in Diagram 6B.6. These are Sector pointclasses
then, and the structure theory of Chapter 4 applies to them.
Since we will be playing games on ù almost exclusively from now on, we will skip
the subscript and abbreviate
Det(Λ) ⇐⇒Detù(Λ)
⇐⇒every set A ⊆N in Λ is determined.
In describing games on ù, it is often convenient to think of I and II as playing
distinct sequences α, â, as we did in some of the exercises of the preceding section, see
Diagram 6B.1. The play then is the sequence
a0, b0, a1, b1, . . . ,

but we often say that I plays α and II plays â in this run. We also describe games in
this way, e.g., we may say that if I plays α and II plays â, then
I wins ⇐⇒P(α, â),
where P ⊆N × N; this is obviously the game Gù(A), where
A =
 α(0), â(0), α(1), â(1), . . .

: P(α, â)
	
.
Clearly A and P can be obtained by recursive substitutions from each other.
We identify a strategy ó for I in a game with the irrational ó deﬁned by
ó(u) =
(
ó
 (u)0, . . . , (u)n−1

,
if Seq(u) & lh(u) = n is even,
0,
otherwise
and similarly for strategies for II. If ó instructs I to play α when II plays â, we write
α = ó ∗[â];
similarly, if ô instructs II to play â when I plays α, we write
â = [α] ∗ô.
Clearly both functions
(ó, â) 7→ó ∗[â],
(α, ô) 7→[α] ∗ô
are recursive on N × N to N.
The key result is the following theorem, dual to 4B.3. (For the deﬁnitions see 4B
and the exercises of 4C.)
6B.1. The First Periodicity Theorem (Martin, Moschovakis(9)). Assume that Γ
is adequate and Det(∆

) holds; if P ⊆X × N is in Γ and admits a Γ-norm, then the set
∀N P admits a ∀N ∃N Γ-norm.
Proof. Assume the hypotheses and let ϕ be a Γ-norm on P and
Q(x) ⇐⇒(∀α)P(x, α).
We will deﬁne a prewellordering ≤on Q and then take ø to be the associated norm,
such that ≤ø = ≤.
Given x, y ∈X, consider the game G(x, y) on ù, where I plays α, II plays â and
I wins ⇐⇒(y, â) <∗
ϕ (x, α);
equivalently,
II wins ⇐⇒¬(y, â) <∗
ϕ (x, α)
⇐⇒¬P(y, â) ∨(x, α) ≤∗
ϕ (y, â).
Put
x ≤y ⇐⇒II has a winning strategy in G(x, y).

We will prove that the restriction of ≤to Q is a prewellordering with the desired
properties.
The motivation for the proof comes from the natural attempt to deﬁne a norm ø
on Q by
ø(x) = supremum{ϕ(x, α) : α ∈N}.
This is a norm of course, but more often than not it is a trivial norm—e.g., if ϕ is a
ℵ1-norm, then we are likely to have ø(x) = ℵ1 for almost all x ∈Q. Deﬁnition (1)
can be interpreted as saying that x ≤y holds when supremum{ϕ(x, α) : α ∈N}
is “eﬀectively” ≤supremum{ϕ(y, â) : â ∈N}, for y ∈Q, in the sense that we
have a strategy ô which correlates with each α (given bit by bit) some â such that
ϕ(x, α) ≤ϕ(y, â).
Because of this picture, we call G(x, y) the sup game for the
norm ϕ.
We now establish the properties of ≤in a sequence of lemmas.
Lemma 1. For every x ∈Q, x ≤x.
Proof. Have II play in G(x, x) simply by copying the moves of I, as in Diagram 6B.2.
Since x ∈Q, we have P(x, α), hence (x, α) ≤∗
ϕ (x, α), and II wins.
⊣(Lemma 1)
Lemma 2. If x, y, z are all in Q, then
(x ≤y & y ≤z) =⇒x ≤z.
Proof. We are assuming that II has winning strategies in both G(x, y) and G(y, z),
and we must describe how II can play to win in G(x, z). Consider Diagram 6B.3.

Suppose I plays a0 in G(x, z). Then I copies a0 in G(x, y) and II answers b0 in that
game by his winning strategy. Then I copies this b0 in G(y, z) and II answers c0 in that
game by his winning strategy. Now II responds with this c0 to a0 in G(x, z).
Next I plays a1 in G(x, z) and II responds by c1which is determined in the same way,
as indicated in the diagram, and similarly for the moves after that. In eﬀect II plays in
G(y, z) by simulating runs of G(x, y) and G(y, z) on the side and watching the moves
of the second players in these games, which follow winning strategies.
It is a simple matter to give a formal deﬁnition of this strategy for II in G(x, z) in
terms of the given strategies for II in G(x, y) and G(y, z) and we will not bother.
At the end of the run, sequences α, â, ã have been played as in the diagram and we
know P(x, α), P(y, â), P(z, ã) (since x, y, z are all in Q) and also ϕ(x, α) ≤ϕ(y, â),
ϕ(y, â) ≤ϕ(z, ã), since II wins G(x, y) and G(y, z). Hence ϕ(x, α) ≤ϕ(z, ã) and
II has also won G(x, z).
This describes a winning strategy for II in G(x, z), hence x ≤z.
⊣(Lemma 2)
Lemma 3. For all x, y G(x, y) is determined.
Proof. If y /∈Q, then II can win by playing any â such that ¬P(y, â). If y ∈Q,
then P(y, â) holds for each â, so that
I wins ⇐⇒(y, â) <∗
ϕ (x, α)
⇐⇒¬(x, α) ≤∗
ϕ (y, â)
and the payoﬀset is in ∆
e
, hence the game is determined by the hypothesis of the
theorem.
⊣(Lemma3)
Put
x < y ⇐⇒x ≤y & ¬(y ≤x).
Lemma 4. If x, y are in Q, then
x < y ⇐⇒I wins G(y, x);
thus for x, y ∈Q,
x ≤y ∨y ≤x.
Proof. If x < y then ¬(y ≤x), so II does not win G(y, x) by deﬁnition, hence
I wins G(y, x) by Lemma 3.
Conversely, suppose I wins G(y, x); then certainly II does not win G(y, x), so to
establish x < y it is enough to show that II wins G(x, y).
Fix a winning strategy for I in G(y, x) and consider Diagram 6B.4.

Diagram 6B.5.
We describe a strategy for II in G(x, y) as follows. Suppose I plays a0 in G(x, y);
II disregards the value of a0 and answers by b0, the ﬁrst winning move of I in G(y, x).
He then copies a0 in G(y, x) and observes that I answers this move of II by b1 in that
game. Suppose now I plays a1 in G(x, y); again II disregards the value of a1 and
responds b1, but then copies a1 in G(y, x) and observes the response b2, etc.
At the end of the game, α, â have been played and I has won G(y, x), i.e., (x, α) <∗
ϕ
(y, â); in particular (x, α) ≤∗
ϕ (y, â), and so II has won G(x, y).
⊣(Lemma 4)
Lemma 5. The relation ≤is wellfounded.
Proof. We must show that there are no inﬁnite descending chains, so assume towards
a contradiction that
x0 > x1 > x2 > · · · ,
i.e., by Lemma 4, I wins G(xi, xi+1) for every i. Fix winning strategies for I in all these
games and consider Diagram 6B.5. Here player I follows the ﬁxed winning strategies
in all the games and the moves of II are ﬁlled in by copying along the dotted arrows.
At the end of the run, sequences α0, α1, α2, . . . have been played and since I wins all
these games we have
ϕ(x0, α0) > ϕ(x1, α1) > ϕ(x2, α2) > · · ·
which is absurd.
⊣(Lemma 5)
We have now shown that ≤is a prewellordering on Q, so let ø : Q →Ordinals be
the regular norm associated with it, i.e.,
x ≤y ⇐⇒ø(x) ≤ø(y)
(x, y ∈Q).
Lemma 6. The norm ø is a ∀N ∃N Γ-norm on Q.

6B.2. Corollary. If Γ is adequate, normed and ∃N Γ ⊆Γ and if Det(∆

∀N Γ is normed.
In particular, PD implies that Π1
1, Σ1
2, Π1
3, Σ1
4, . . . , Π1
n (n odd ), Σ1
k (k even) are all
Spector pointclasses.
Proof is immediate from 6B.1 and 4B.3.
⊣
We often refer to this corollary instead of 6B.1 as the (ﬁrst) Periodicity Theorem
for the obvious reason. Recall from 4B.13 that Σ1
n and Π1
n cannot both be normed,
so that the oscillating picture of the analytical pointclasses we get from PD is in fact
totally diﬀerent from the picture when we assume N ⊆L.
At this point, one should go back to sections 4B–4D and recall the structure theory
for Spector pointclasses developed there: these results have now been established for
all Π1
n (n odd) and Σ1
k (k even), under the hypothesis of projective determinacy.
We should also point out here that the ﬁrst periodicity theorem gives a new and
interesting proof of the prewellordering theorem for Π1
1, 4B.2, as follows.
By 4B.8, every pointset of type 1 in Σ0
1 admits a Σ0
1-norm. Now 3C.14 implies
immediately that
∀N ∃N Σ0
1 = ∀N Σ0
1 = Π1
1;
hence by 6B.1 every Π1
1 pointset of type 1 admits a Π1
1-norm, using the determinacy
of ∆
e
0
1 (clopen) sets. This yields immediately that Π1
1 is normed, by 4B.9.
This is one of the characteristic features of the game-theoretic proofs that we will
construct in this chapter; when we apply them to pointclasses whose determinacy is
known (like Σ
e
0
1, Σ
e
0
1 or Σ

2), we obtain new proofs of classical results about Π1
1 and Σ1
2.

2n); now this makes
sense even when n = 0, in which case it is simply true, by the Gale-Stewart Theorem.
6C. The Second Periodicity Theorem; uniformization
The next obvious question is whether the hypothesis of projective determinacy
settles the uniformization problem: must each projective set be uniformizable by some
projective set? We show here that it does, but in a precise way which diﬀers from the
situation in L and which reveals further the periodicity phenomenon we uncovered
in 6B.
We will show that if PD holds, then the scale property oscillates between the Σ and
Π sides of the Kleene hierarchy together with the prewellordering property. Consider
ﬁrst the analog for scales of 4B.3 which we did not establish in 4E—we had no use for
it then.
6C.1. Lemma (Moschovakis [1971a]). Suppose Γ is adequate, X is a space of type 1,
P ⊆X × N is in Γ and P admits a Γ-scale; then ∃N P admits a ∃N ∀N Γ-scale.
Proof. By 4E.2, let ϕ = {ϕn} be a very good Γ-scale on P and put
P∗(x, α) ⇐⇒(∀n)(∀â)[(x, α) ≤∗
ϕn (x, â)];
we showed in 4E.3 that P∗uniformizes P. Let
Q(x) ⇐⇒(∃α)P(x, α)
⇐⇒(∃α)P∗(x, α)
and deﬁne ø = {øn} on Q by
øn(x) = ϕn(x, α) for the unique α such that P∗(x, α).
We verify that ø is a scale on Q.
If x0, x1, . . . are all in Q and øn(xi) = ën for each n and all large i, choose α0, α1, . . .
such that P∗(xi, αi), so that by deﬁnition
ϕn(xi, αi) = øn(xi).
Thus ϕn(xi, αi) = ën for each n and all large i, and since ϕ is a very good scale, we
have xi →x, αi →α and
ϕn(x, α) ≤ën, all n.
In particular of course, Q(x). Now choose α∗such that P∗(x, α∗) and notice that for
each n,
øn(x) = ϕn(x, α∗) ≤ϕn(x, α) ≤ën,
where the inequality ϕn(x, α∗) ≤ϕn(x, α) follows from the deﬁnition of P∗. Thus ø
is a scale.
That ø is a ∃N ∀N Γ-scale follows from the easy equivalence
x ≤∗
øn y ⇐⇒(∃α)(∀â)[P∗(x, α) & (x, α) ≤∗
ϕn (y, â)]
and the similar one for <∗
øn.
⊣
6C.2. Theorem (Moschovakis [1971a]). If Σ0
1 ⊆Γ and Γ is adequate, closed under
∀N and scaled, then ∃N Γ is also scaled.
In particular, Σ1

There is no immediate use at this point for the fact that Σ1

it later. For now, 6C.2 will serve only as an induction loading device, in conjunction
with the next result.
6C.3. The Second Periodicity Theorem (Moschovakis [1971a]).
Suppose Γ is
adequate and Det(∆
e
) holds. If P ⊆X × N is in Γ of type 1 and admits a Γ-scale, then
the set ∀N P admits a ∀N ∃N Γ-scale.
Proof. Let ϕ = {ϕn} be a ﬁxed very good Γ-scale on P and put
Q(x) ⇐⇒(∀α)P(x, α).
It will be convenient to have an eﬀective enumeration of all ﬁnite sequences of
integers, so put
u(0) = the empty sequence,
u(i) = the sequence coded by the i’th number v such that Seq(v).
It is immediate from this deﬁnition that if u(i) is a proper initial segment of u(j), then
i < j.
If u is a ﬁnite sequence and α ∈N, let
u ≺α ⇐⇒u is an initial segment of α
and put
x ∈Qn ⇐⇒
 ∀α ≻u(n)

P(x, α).
Clearly Q0 = Q and Q ⊆Qn for every n. We will deﬁne a norm øn on each Qn
by considering a game Gn(x, y), very much as in the proof of the First Periodicity
Theorem 6B.1.
Suppose I and II play sequences α′, â′ in the usual fashion. We let
α = u(n)bα′ = u(n)b(a0, a1, . . . )
â = u(n)bâ′ = u(n)b(b0, b1, . . . )
and we put
I wins Gn(x, y) ⇐⇒(y, â) <∗
ϕn (x, α)
or equivalently,
II wins Gn(x, y) ⇐⇒¬P(y, â) ∨(x, α) ≤∗
ϕn (y, â).
We can think of Gn(x, y) as a subgame of the sup game for the norm ϕn as we
deﬁned this in 6B.1, where both players have been saddled with the same ﬁrst few
moves—those in the sequence u(n). It will be useful to think of α and â as the plays
in Gn(x, y) ( instead of α′ and â′).

6C.3]
6C. The Second Periodicity Theorem; uniformization
237
Put now
x ≤n y ⇐⇒II has a winning strategy in Gn(x, y).
Using the arguments in 6B.1, one easily checks that each ≤n is a prewellordering on Qn
and that the associated norm øn on Qn is a ∀N ∃N Γ-norm. Moreover, the relations
R(n, x, y) ⇐⇒x ∈Qn & x ≤∗
øn y,
S(n, x, y) ⇐⇒x ∈Qn & x <∗
øn y
are also in ∀N ∃N Γ.
It will be very easy to turn the sequence ø = {øn} into a ∀N ∃N Γ-scale on Q, after
we prove the following key fact.
Lemma. Suppose x0, x1, . . . are all in Q, limi→∞xi = x and for each n and all large
i, øn(xi) = ën; then x ∈Q and for each n, øn(x) ≤ën.
Proof. By passing to a subsequence if necessary, we may assume that
i ≥n =⇒øn(xi) = ën.
To show ﬁrst that x ∈Q, we must verify that for each ﬁxed α, P(x, α) holds. Choose
ni so that
u(ni) =
 α(0), . . . , α(i −1)

and consider the subsequence
xn0, xn1, xn2, . . . .
Now ni < ni+1, and hence
øni (xni ) = øni (xni+1) = ëni ,
so that
xni+1 ≤ni xni
and II has a winning strategy in all the games Gni(xni+1, xni). Fix winning strategies
for II in all these games and consider Diagram 6C.2 which is constructed by the
following rules.
To begin with, I plays α(i) in Gni(xni+1, xni).
After II responds to this (by his
winning strategy) with a move that we have labeled αi(i), I plays by copying αi(i) into
the preceding game Gni−1(xni , xni−1), as we have indicated by the dotted lines. Now
II plays again to win and I corresponds by copying, etc. ad inﬁnitum.
At the end, plays α0, α1, α2, . . . have been determined and it is obvious that
limi→∞αi = α,
since in fact
αi(j) = α(j)
for j < i.
Moreover, II wins all these runs, so we have for every i,
ϕni(xni+1, αi+1) ≤ϕni(xni , αi).
Since the scale ϕ is very good, this implies that for each ﬁxed k and all i which are
large enough (so that k ≤ni),
ϕk(xni+1, αi+1) ≤ϕk(xni , αi),
so that in fact there are ordinals ìk and
ϕk(xni , αi) = ìk

for all large i; hence P(x, α), since ϕ is a scale on P. Thus P(x, α) holds for every α
and x ∈Q.
We now prove that for each n,
øn(x) ≤ën.
If k ≤m, then øk(xk) = øk(xm), hence xm ≤k xk and II has a winning strategy in
each of the games Gk(xm, xk) (k ≤m). Fix winning strategies for II in each of these
games and ﬁx the number n. We will describe how II can play to win Gn(x, xn), thus
showing x ≤n xn, i.e., øn(x) ≤øn(xn) = ën.
Player II will win by utilizing many of the strategies in the games Gk(xm, xk). In
fact, he will construct on the side a diagram of games much like the one above, and his
moves in Gn(x, xn) will be copied from the appropriate places in that diagram. The
only additional complication in this argument is that II does not know ahead of time
which of the games Gk(xm, xk) he wants to play on the side; these will depend on the
moves I makes in Gn(x, xn).
Consider then Diagram 6C.3 which is constructed as follows.
Let n0 = n and suppose that the sequence u(n) has length l–these are useful notation
conventions.
Suppose that I starts by playing al in Gn(x, xn).
Choose n1 so that u(n1) =
u(n0)b(al), so that n0 < n1 and start the game Gn0(xn1, xn0) with I playing al in
it. Have II respond by his winning strategy by some α0(l) (α0 will be his eventual play
in this game) and have II play the same α0(l) in Gn(x, xn).
Suppose now that I plays al+1 in Gn(x, xn). Let u(n2) = u(n0)b(al, al+1) so that
n1 < n2 and start the game Gn1(xn2, xn1) with I playing al+1; II responds to win by
α1(l + 1), we copy this move in Gn0(xn1, xn0), II responds by α0(l + 1) and ﬁnally
II plays this α0(l + 1) in Gn(x, xn).

Continuing in this fashion as in the diagram, we determine successively games
Gni(xni+1, xni) and plays αi, so that if α is the play of I in Gn(x, xn), then
limi→∞αi = α,
since in fact
j < l + i =⇒ai = α(j) = αi(j).
Moreover, II wins all these games, so that
ϕni(xni+1, αi+1) ≤ϕni(xni , αi).
We now argue very much as in the ﬁrst part of this proof: since ϕ is a very good
scale, we have
ϕk(xni+1, αi+1) ≤ϕk(xni , αi)
(∗)
for all i large enough so that k ≤ni, hence all the norms ϕk(xni , αi) are eventually
constant, and hence we have P(x, α) and for each k,
ϕk(x, α) ≤limi→∞ϕk(xni, αi).
(∗∗)
Taking k = n = n0 in (∗) for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , we have
ϕn0(xn0, α0) ≥ϕn0(xn1, α1) ≥ϕn0(xn2, α2) ≥· · · ≥limi→∞ϕn0(xni , αi),
so that by (∗∗)
ϕn0(xn0, α0) ≥ϕn0(x, α)
and II wins the game Gn(x, xn).
⊣(Lemma)
Going back to the proof of the theorem, suppose all the norms øn are into the
ordinal κ, let
(î, ç) 7→⟨î, ç⟩
be an order-preserving map of κ × κ (ordered lexicographically) into the ordinals and
put
ø′
n(x) = ⟨ø0(x), øn(x)⟩.
It is easy to check (as in the proof of 4E.1) that ø′ = {ø′
n} is a ∀N ∃N Γ-scale on Q.⊣
6C.4. Corollary. If Π0
1 ⊆Γ and Γ is adequate, scaled and ∃N Γ ⊆Γ, and if Det(∆
e
)
holds, then ∀N Γ is also scaled.
In particular, PD implies that Π1
1, Σ1
2, Π1
3, Σ1
4, . . . , Π1
n (n odd ), Σ1
k (k even) are all
scaled.
⊣
6C.5. The Uniformization Theorem (Moschovakis [1971a]). If PD holds, then
every projective set can be uniformized by a projective set and every analytical set can be
uniformized by an analytical set.

These two results are the most obvious and signiﬁcant consequences of the Second
Periodicity Theorem, but there are others. We will consider some of them in the
exercises here and in the next two sections.
Recall the notational convention
Σ1
0 = Σ0

which we introduced in page 234. Many of the results in the exercises depend on the
hypothesis Det(∆

Exercises
Let us take up ﬁrst a few facts about bases which complement 6C.6.
6C.7. Prove that if Det(∆

2n) holds, then ∆1
2n+1 is not a basis for Π1
2n—i.e., there is
a non-empty Π1
2n set A ⊆N which has no ∆1
2n+1-recursive member.
Hint. See 4D.10.
⊣
6C.8. Prove that if Det(∆

2n+1 set.
Hint. See 4D.11.
⊣
Kleene’s Basis Theorem for Σ1
1 (4E.8) does not extend to all Σ1
2n+1, but Martin and
Solovay have found a better basis for this pointclass than ∆1
2n+2. In our presentation
of their results here we will use the important notion of the (∆1
k)-hull of a pointset
introduced in Kechris [1975],
Hullk(A) = {α ∈N : (∀x)[x ∈A =⇒α ∈∆1
k(x)]}.
Recall the deﬁnition of αp (for P a pointset of type 0) on page 180.
6C.9. (a) Assume Det(∆
e
1
2n) (n ≥1) and prove the following three properties of
hulls.
(i) If A is Σ1
2n+1, then Hull2n+1(A) is Π1
2n+1.
(ii) If A ̸= ∅and A is Σ1
2n+1, then there exists a Π1
2n set B ̸= ∅, B ⊆N such that
B ∩Hull2n+1(A) = ∅.
(iii) If P is a Σ1
2n+1 pointset of type 0 and αP is its contracted characteristic function,
then there is a non-empty Σ1
2n+1 set A such that αP ∈Hull2n+1(A).
(b) (Martin-Solovay, cf. Kechris, Martin, and Solovay [1983]). Infer that for any
Σ1
2n+1 set P of type 0, {x : x ∈∆1
2n+1(αP)} is not a basis for Π1
2n.
Hint. (i) is a trivial computation using 4D.14.
To prove (ii) check ﬁrst that it is enough to ﬁnd a Σ1
2n+1 set B ⊆N such that B ̸= ∅
but B ∩Hull2n+1(A) = ∅and then (assuming for simplicity that A ⊆N) take
B = {⟨α, â⟩: α ∈A & â /∈∆1
2n+1(α)}.
Clearly B ̸= ∅if A ̸= ∅, and if ⟨α, â⟩∈B ∩Hull2n+1(A), then α ∈A and hence
⟨α, â⟩∈∆1
2n+1(α) contradicting ⟨α, â⟩∈B.

[6C.10
For (iii), assume for simplicity that P ⊆ù, let ϕ : Q →Ordinals be a Π1
2n+1-norm
on Q = ù \ P and put
α ∈A ⇐⇒{(n, m) : α(⟨n, m⟩) = 1} is a prewellordering

h
Q(m) =⇒(∀n)

.
If α ∈A, then obviously {(n, m) : α(⟨n, m⟩) = 1} is a prewellordering which extends
the prewellordering ≤∗induced by ϕ; thus
α ∈A =⇒{(n, m) : Q(n) & Q(m) & ϕ(n) ≤ϕ(m)} is recursive in α
=⇒aQ is recursive in α =⇒aP is recursive in α
so that aP ∈Hull2n+1(A).
The last assertion follows immediately from (ii) and (iii).

and suppose α0 is a Π1
2n+1 singleton but α0 /∈∆1
2n+1; prove that {x : x ∈∆1
2n+1(α0)}
is a basis for Σ1
2n+1.
Hint. It is of course enough to prove that if A is Π1
2n and ∅̸= A ⊆N, then there is
some α ∈A ∩∆1
2n+1(α0). Given such an A, let
B = {α : α ∈A & α0 /∈∆1
2n+1(α)}
and check ﬁrst that B ̸= ∅; because B = ∅means precisely that α0 ∈Hull(A), and
then
α0b(s) = t ⇐⇒(∀â)

â ∈A =⇒
 ∃α ∈∆1
2n+1(â)

[α = α0 & α(s) = t]

which implies directly that α0 has Π1
2n+1 graph and hence it is ∆1
2n+1 (recall that
{α : α = α0} is Π1
2n+1 by hypothesis). Check also that B is Σ1
2n+1 since
α ∈B ⇐⇒α ∈A & [∀â ∈∆1
2n+1(α)][â ̸= α0].
Fix a very good Π1
2n+1-scale ϕ on A and check that it is in fact a ∆1
2n+1-scale since
A is Π1
2n. The idea is to pick some αB in A by choosing the leftmost branch on the
tree determined by ϕ on B; it will not in general be true that αB ∈B, but of course
we only need some αB ∈A.
As in the proof of 4F.20 then, put
ës = least ë such that (∃â)[â ∈B & ϕs(â) = ë],
Bs = {â ∈B : ϕs(â) = ës}
and check by a simple very-good-scale argument that each Bs ̸= ∅and that there is a
unique αB ∈A such that if α0 ∈B0, α1 ∈B1, . . . , then lims→∞αs = αB. It remains
to show that αB ∈∆1
2n+1(α0).
Computing,
αB(s) = t ⇐⇒(∃â){(∀i)[(â)i ∈Bi] & (∀i)(∃j ≥i)[(â)j(s) = t]}
so that it is enough to check that the relation
P(s, â) ⇐⇒â ∈Bs
is in Σ1
2n+1(α0).
Put
Q(s, â) ⇐⇒(∀ã)[ã ∈B =⇒â ≤∗

so that
â ∈Bs ⇐⇒â ∈B & Q(s, â)
and Q is obviously Π1
2n+1; so is {(0, α) : α = α0} by hypothesis, so let G ⊆ù×(ù×N)
be universal in Π1
2n+1, let ø be a Π1
2n+1-norm on G and choose k0, l0, so that
α = α0 ⇐⇒G(k0, 0, α)
Q(s, â) ⇐⇒G(l0, s, â).
Suppose that there is some â ∈B so that Q(s, â) and ø(k0, 0, α0) < ø(l0, s, â) for
some s; then
α0(m) = w ⇐⇒(∀α)[(l0, s, â) ≤∗
ø (k0, 0, α) ∨α(m) = w]
and hence α0 ∈∆1
2n+1(â) which contradicts â ∈B. Hence for each s and each â ∈B,
Q(s, â) ⇐⇒G(l0, s, â) & ø(l0, s, â) ≤ø(k0, 0, α0)
⇐⇒¬(k0, 0, α0) <∗
ø (l0, s, â)
so that ﬁnally
â ∈Bs ⇐⇒â ∈B & ¬(k0, 0, α0) <∗
ø (l0, s, â).

This result takes a more interesting form if we add to it a simple observation.

2n) and prove that the
collection of Π1
2n+1-singletons in N is prewellordered by the relation
α ≤2n+1 â ⇐⇒α ∈∆1
2n+1(â).
Thus if α0 is ≤2n+1-minimal among the non-∆1
2n+1 singletons in Π1
2n+1, then the set
{x : x ∈∆1
2n+1(α0)} is a basis for Σ1
2n+1.
Hint. Let G(e, α) be Π1
2n+1-universal, suppose â0, ã0 are Π1
2n+1-singletons and
choose m, n so that
â = â0 ⇐⇒G(m, â),
ã = ã0 ⇐⇒G(n, ã).
Let ϕ be a Π1
2n+1-norm on G and suppose that ϕ(m, â0) ≤ϕ(n, ã0); then
â0(s) = t ⇐⇒(∃â)[¬(n, ã0) <∗
ϕ (m, â) & â(s) = t],
so that â0 ∈∆1
2n+1(ã0).
⊣
In 7C.7 we will show that the Σ1
1 set P of type 0 in Kleene’s Basis Theorem 4E.8
can be chosen so that αP is a Π1
1-singleton; in this sense, the Martin-Solovay theorem
above gives a natural generalization to all odd n of the result of Kleene.
Recall the deﬁnition of the ordinals ä

but they are interesting as they reveal the nature of the second periodicity theorem as
a structure theorem for projective pointsets.

Hint. For the ﬁrst assertion it is enough to show that Π

(by 2B.2) and this follows immediately from 6C.4, 4C.9 and 2B.1.
For the second assertion, again it is enough to show that Π

6D. The game quantiﬁer
G
With each pointset P ⊆X × N we associate the set
G
P,
x ∈
G
P ⇐⇒(
G
α)P(x, α)
⇐⇒I wins the game {α : P(x, α)};
G
is a set operation, a quantiﬁer like ∃N and ∀N . We read
G
α as “game α” or “gee
α.”
Our main result here is that under reasonable closure and determinacy hypotheses,
the prewellordering property transfers from a pointclass Γ to
G
Γ = {
G
P : P ⊆X × N, P ∈Γ}.
We will also show that if Γ is adequate and Det(Γ
e
) holds, then
∀N Γ ⊆Γ =⇒
G
Γ = ∃N Γ,
∃N Γ ⊆Γ =⇒
G
Γ = ∀N Γ,

Thus the transfer theorem gives an “explanation” of the periodicity phenomenon. It
will also have several concrete applications in the next section.
It is often very useful to think of
G
α as an inﬁnite string of alternating quantiﬁers.

More generally, suppose
Q = (Q0, Q1, Q2, . . . )
is an inﬁnite string, where for each i,
Qi = ∃or Qi = ∀,
and let A ⊆N. We associate with Q and A a game G with two players call them ∃
and ∀; a run of G consists of their choosing an inﬁnite sequence a0, a1, a2, . . . with ∃
choosing ai if Qi = ∃and ∀choosing ai if Qi = ∀. When the play α = (a0, a1, a2, . . . )
is determined, we put
∃wins ⇐⇒α ∈A.
The notions of strategy, winning strategy, etc. are deﬁned for these more general
games in the obvious way.
Of course the game Gù(A) which we deﬁned in 6A
corresponds to the inﬁnite alternating string
∃, ∀, ∃, ∀, . . . .
Now each such inﬁnite string deﬁnes in a natural way a set operation,
{(Q0a0)(Q1a1)(Q2a2) · · · }P

⇐⇒∃has a winning strategy in the game G.
Let us call the string Q = (Q0, Q1, Q2, . . . ) recursive if the function
f(i) =
(
0,
if Qi = ∃,
1,
if Qi = ∀
is recursive.
6D.1. Lemma. Suppose Γ is a pointclass closed under recursive substitution, Q =
(Q0, Q1, Q2, . . . ) is a recursive inﬁnite string of quantiﬁers and P ⊆X ×N is in Γ. Then
the relation

is in

Γ.
Moreover, if Det(Γ

{α : P(x, α)} is determined.
Proof. Deﬁne g : ù →ù by
g(i) =

if Qi = ∀,
so that g is recursive and (easily)

Finally, (v) and (vi) follow immediately from (ii) and (iii) and (vii) is trivial.

We now come to the main result of this section. This is stated in a strong and detailed
form because it will have applications later beyond the transfer of the prewellordering
property from Γ to
G
Γ which concerns us here.
6D.3. The Norm-Transfer Theorem for
G
(Moschovakis). Suppose Γ is an ade-
quate pointclass, Det(Γ

If ϕ is a Γ-norm on P, then there exists a

In particular, if Γ is adequate and normed and if Det(Γ

G
Γ is also normed.
Proof. Assume the hypothesis and for each x, y deﬁne the game H(x, y) which is
played as in Diagram 6D.1. There are two players, as usual, whom we have named
F (ﬁrst) and S (second). We have also indicated in the diagram which player makes
each move. At the end of the game, plays α and â have been determined and
S wins the run ⇐⇒(x, α) ≤∗

Player S makes the moves of ∃on the top board and the moves of ∀on the bottom

The sequence of moves by which we have interweaved these two games in deﬁning

Proof . Assume x ≤∗y and y ≤∗z and consider Diagram 6D.2 which describes
a strategy of S in H(x, z), given winning strategies of S in H(x, y) and H(y, z). As
usual, broken arrows indicate copies of moves and solid arrows show responses by the
ﬁxed winning strategies.
It is clear that this strategy is winning for S in H(x, z) since at the end of the run
we have plays α, â, ã and
(x, α) ≤∗

(y, â) ≤∗

Lemma 2. There is no inﬁnite sequence of points x0, x1, x2, . . . such that Q(x0) and
for every i, F wins H(xi, xi+1).
Proof . Assume towards a contradiction that there were such a sequence and ﬁx
winning strategies for F in all the games H(xi, xi+1). Fix also a winning strategy for
∃in the game that veriﬁes the assertion
Q(x0) ⇐⇒{(∀a0)(∃a1)(∀a2) · · · }P

and consider Diagram 6D.3; as usually, the moves of S (and ∀in the game for Q(x0))
are obtained by copying along the broken arrows and the moves for F and ∃are by
the ﬁxed winning strategies.
At the end of the games plays α0, α1, α2, . . . have been determined and ∃wins the
game on the bottom line, so that we have P(x, α0); however, F wins each H(xi, xi+1),

⊣(Lemma 2)
Lemma 3. The restriction of ≤∗to Q is a prewellordering.
Proof . We already know that ≤∗is transitive. If x, y ∈Q and we do not have
x ≤∗y, we have that F wins H(x, y); if F also won H(y, x), then the inﬁnite
sequence x, y, x, y, . . . would violate Lemma 2, so that S wins H(y, x) and y ≤∗x.
The assertion x ≤∗x (x ∈Q) is proved similarly and then the lemma follows
immediately.
⊣(Lemma 3)
Let ø be the regular norm on Q associated with ≤∗, i.e.,
x ≤∗y ⇐⇒ø(x) ≤ø(y)
(x, y ∈Q).
Lemma 4. For every x, y,
x ≤∗
ø y ⇐⇒x ≤∗y.
Proof . Assume ﬁrst x ≤∗
ø y, so that in particular x ∈Q. If also y ∈Q, then
x ≤∗y since on Q the relations ≤∗
ø and ≤∗coincide by deﬁnition. If y /∈Q, have S
play in H(x, y) to insure P(x, α) on the top board and ¬P(y, â) on the bottom board.
Conversely, assume x ≤∗y. If x ∈Q, then immediately x ≤∗
ø y, taking cases on
y ∈Q or y /∈Q. Nut x ≤∗y easily implies that x ∈Q, since S’s winning strategy
in H(x, y) restricted on the top board gives a winning strategy for ∃in the game
verifying Q(x).
⊣(Lemma 4)
To prove that <∗
ø satisﬁes the formula in the statement of the theorem let H ′(x, y)
be the game corresponding to this formula which is played as in Diagram 6D.4. The
payoﬀis given by
F wins ⇐⇒(x, α) <∗
ϕ (y, â)
and we must show:
Lemma 5. For each x, y,
x <∗
ø y ⇐⇒F wins H ′(x, y).
Proof . Assume ﬁrst x <∗
ø y and x ∈Q but y /∈Q. In this case F can easily win
H ′(x, y) by playing on the top board to insure P(x, α) while playing on the bottom
board to insure ¬P(y, â).
If x <∗
ø y and both x, y ∈Q, then by Lemma 4 we must have that ¬(y ≤∗x)
so that F wins the game H(y, x). Assume also towards a contradiction that S wins
H ′(x, y), ﬁx winning strategies for these two games and ﬁx also a strategy for ∃in
the game verifying that y ∈Q. Now play these three games against each other as in
Diagram 6D.5, where we indicate copied moves by broken arrows and moves by the
winning strategies by solid arrows in the usual way.

After all the games have been played we have determined plays â0, α1, â1, α2, . . .
and the following relations hold:
P(y, â0), since ∃wins the game on the top row,
¬(y, â0) ≤∗
ϕ (x, α1), hence (x, α1) <∗
ϕ (y, â0), since F wins H(y, x),
¬(x, α1) <∗
ϕ (y, â1), hence (y, â1) ≤∗
ϕ (x, α1), since S wins H ′(x, y).
etc. But then we obviously have
ϕ(y, â0) > ϕ(x, α1) ≥ϕ(y, â1) > ϕ(x, â2) > · · ·
which is absurd.
Finally suppose F wins H ′(x, y) but ¬(x <∗
ø y). Since F ’s winning strategy in
H ′(x, y) restricted to the top board implies immediately that x ∈Q, we must then
have that y ≤∗
ø x so that S wins H(y, x). Fix then winning strategies for F in H ′(x, y)
and S in H(y, x) and play them against each other as in Diagram 6D.6. We obtain
plays α, â such that
(x, α) <∗
ϕ (y, â) & (y, â) ≤∗

Intuitively, I is attempting to deﬁne some y = ð(ã) by giving ã and then win the game
{α : Q∗(y, α)} so as to guarantee (
G
α)Q∗(y, α); he must give the correct y however,
so that
(∀s)[y ∈Ns ⇐⇒(

(∗)
and y = f(x). To insure this, II is allowed to give ä(0), ä(1), . . . which may all be 0,
but at any given j he may play
ä(j) = s + 1,
at which point either y = ð(ã) /∈Ns or I must win the game {â : P∗(x, s, â)} insuring
(
G
â)P∗(x, s, â).
We claim that if f(x) = y so that (∗) holds, then
Q(y) =⇒I wins G(x);
simply have I play ã, so that ð(ã) = y, play on board 1 so that ultimately Q∗(y, α)
and if and when II plays some ä(j) = s + 1 (with j even and i < j =⇒ä(i) = 0)
and with y ∈Ns, have I play on board 4 to deﬁne some â′ = t 7→â(j + t) so that
P∗(x, s, â′).
Conversely, if f(x) = y and (∗) holds,
I wins G(x) =⇒Q(y).
To check this consider Diagram 6D.8 where I plays in G(x) by his winning strategy.
We claim that ð(ã) = y and Q∗(y, α), so that this deﬁnes a winning strategy for I in
{α : Q∗(y, α)} insuring Q(y).

To verify this, notice that if ð(ã) ̸= y, then for some s y /∈Ns but ð(ã) ∈Ns.
Choose j large enough and even so that
ã(j) = ã′(j) =⇒ð(ã′) ∈Ns
and have II play against I (who is using his ﬁxed winning strategy) by giving
ä(i) = 0 for i < j,
ä(j) = s + 1
and then play on board 4 to insure ¬P∗(x, s, â′), which he can do since y /∈Ns. No
matter what ã′ is played by I, we have ð(ã′) ∈Ns, so I loses the run, contradicting the
assumption that he is following a winning strategy.

(since I wins G(x)), we have Q∗(y, α)

It follows from these claims that if f(x)↓and f(x) = y, then
Q(y) ⇐⇒I wins G(x)
and we can take
R(x) ⇐⇒I wins G(x);
this is in

6E. The Third Periodicity Theorem; deﬁnable winning strategies.
Suppose A ⊆N is a Σ1
2 set and player I has a winning strategy in the game A. Now
the set W of strategies winning for I is Π1
3,
ó ∈W ⇐⇒(∀â)(ó ∗[â] ∈A),
hence it has a ∆1
4 member (if Det(∆
e
1
2) holds) by the Basic Theorem 6C.6. We will show
here that in fact, if Det(Σ
e
1
2) holds, then I has a ∆1
3 winning strategy. In its proper,
general context, this is the last basic result we need in order to extend most of the
structure theory of Π1
1 and Σ1
2 to all the higher levels—and to many other Spector
pointclasses besides.
For the ﬁrst time here we will use the existence of scales as a hypothesis to obtain
results other than uniformization. Actually semiscales will suﬃce.
A Γ-semiscale on a pointset P is a sequence ϕ = {ϕn} of norms on P which is a
semiscale in the sense of 2B and such that the relations
R(n, x, y) ⇐⇒x ≤∗
ϕn y,
S(n, x, y) ⇐⇒x <∗
ϕn y,
are in Γ. As with scales (which have the additional lower semicontinuity property),
we call ϕ very good if the following two conditions hold:

(2) If x, y are in P and ϕn(x) ≤ϕn(y), then for each i ≤n, ϕi(x) ≤ϕi(y).
It is very easy to check (as in 4E.2) that if a pointset P of type 1 in an adequate
pointclass Γ admits a Γ-semiscale, then P admits a very good Γ-semiscale.
6E.1. The Third Periodicity Theorem (Moschovakis [1973]). Suppose Γ is ade-
quate, Det(Γ
e
) holds and A ⊆N is in Γ and admits a Γ-semiscale; if player I wins the
game, then I has a
G
Γ-recursive winning strategy.
Proof. Fix a very good Γ-semiscale ϕ on A and for each even integer k put
u ∈Wk ⇐⇒Seq(u) & lh(u) = k + 1
& {(∀ak+1)(∃ak+2)(∀ak+3)(∃ak+4) · · · }

∈A
so that Wk consists of all the winning positions for I in the game A—when it is next II’s
turn to play. Clearly each Wk is in
G
Γ.
If u = ⟨a0, . . . , ak⟩, v = ⟨b0, . . . , bk⟩, let Hk(u, v) be the game played as in Dia-
gram 6E.1. At the end of each run plays
α = ubα∗= (a0, a1, . . . , ak, ak+1, ak+2, . . . ),
â = vbâ∗= (b0, b1, . . . , bk, bk+1, bk+2, . . . ),
have been constructed and
S wins the run ⇐⇒α ≤∗
ϕk â
i.e.,
F wins the run ⇐⇒α /∈A ∨â <∗
ϕk α.
If we rewrite the deﬁnition of Wk in the form
u ∈Wk ⇐⇒{(∀ak+1)(∃ak+2) · · · }

it becomes completely obvious that this is a special case of the construction in 6D.3

Thus we know that there is a

Γ-norm øk on Wk such that for all u, v,
u ≤∗
øk v ⇐⇒S wins the game Hk(u, v).
It is worth for the motivation here to recall the meaning of the game Hk(u, v).
In Hk(u, v), we are in eﬀect playing simultaneously two runs of the game A. On the
top board we are given the starting position a0, . . . , ak and S makes the moves of I

while F makes the moves of II; on the bottom board we start from b0, . . . , bk and the
roles are reversed, with F making the moves for I and S making the moves for II. Now
S wins Hk(u, v) if he wins A (as I) on the top board and either he also wins A ( as II)
on the bottom board or at least he does not lose there with an ordinal ϕk(â) less than
the ordinal ϕk(α) assigned to his winning play on the top board.
It is obvious that the relations
R(k, u, v) ⇐⇒Seq(u) & Seq(v) & lh(u) = lh(v) = k + 1 & u ≤∗
øk v,
S(k, u, v) ⇐⇒Seq(u) & Seq(v) & lh(u) = lh(v) = k + 1 & u <∗
øk v,
are both in
G
Γ. To simplify notation we will write
u ≤∗
k v ⇐⇒u ≤∗
øk v,
u <∗
k v ⇐⇒u <∗
øk v.
Call an odd sequence code u = ⟨a0, . . . , ak−1, ak⟩minimal if for every b,
⟨a0, . . . , ak−1, ak⟩≤∗
k ⟨a0, . . . , ak−1, b⟩.
The next lemma is the crucial argument in the proof of this theorem.
Lemma. Suppose α = (a0, a1, a2, . . . ) is such that for every even k, the initial segment
⟨a0, . . . , ak⟩is minimal; then α ∈A.
Proof . The argument is quite similar to the key lemma in the proof of the Second
Periodicity Theorem 6C.3, but a bit more elaborate. We will construct a master dia-
gram of games Hk(u, v), one for each even k, which will determine plays α0, α1, α2, . . .
in A such that limi→∞α2i = α and all norms ϕk(α2i) are eventually ﬁxed. This will
imply that α ∈A, since ϕ is a semiscale.
For each even k, we will have u = ⟨a0, . . . , ak⟩in the game Hk(u, v) which we will
play; but we will take v = ⟨a0, . . . , ak−1, b⟩with a certain b which will depend on the
various moves which are made as the construction of the diagram progresses.
To begin with, ﬁx in every game Hk(⟨a0, . . . , ak⟩, ⟨a0, , . . . , ak−1, b⟩) a winning strat-
egy for S. Fix also some winning strategy for I in A.
Suppose I’s winning strategy in A starts with a move α0(0). Take u0 = ⟨a0⟩, v0 =
⟨α0(0)⟩and start the game H0 = H0(u0, v0) as in Diagram 6E.2, with F playing a1.
It is obvious how this Stage 0 of the construction is built up.
The play α2(2)
determined by S’s winning strategy in H0 is important, as it initiates Stage 2 of the
construction. Put
u2 = ⟨a0, a1, a2⟩,
v2 = ⟨a0, a1, α2(2)⟩
H2 = H2(u2, v2)

and start H2 with F playing a3. The other moves in this second stage are ﬁlled in by
copying and using the ﬁxed winning strategies in the obvious way; see Diagram 6E.3.
Now the key move is the last one by S in H2, α4(4). Put
u4 = ⟨a0, a1, a2, a3, a4⟩,
v4 = ⟨a0, a1, a2, a3, α4(4)⟩
H4 = H4(u4, v4)
and start H4 with F playing a5. This will be Stage 4 of the construction.
It is clear how we can continue this construction successively with stages numbered
by the even integers 0, 2, 4, 6, . . . . At stage 2n we determine values α0(i), . . . , α2n+2(i)
for all i ≤2n +2 and using α2n+2(2n +2) we can start the next stage. At the end plays
α0, α2, α4, . . . are determined and we have established that I wins A, so that α0 ∈A
and S wins every H2n, so that all α2n are in A and
ϕ2n+2(α2n+2) ≤ϕ2n+2(α2n).
Using the fact that ϕ is a very good semiscale, it is easy to check (as in the proof
of 6C.3) that all the norms ϕi(α2n) are ultimately constant, as n →∞. It follows that
α = limn→∞α2n ∈A.
⊣(Lemma)
The import of the lemma is that I can win A by playing each time so that the
successive initial pieces of the run
⟨a0⟩, ⟨a0, a1, a2⟩, ⟨a0, a1, a2, a3, a4⟩, . . .
are minimal. We will complete the proof of the theorem by verifying that he can do
this by following a
G
Γ-recursive strategy.
Let u, v vary over sequence codes (integers) and put
Min(u) ⇐⇒Seq(u) & lh(u) is odd & u ∈Wlh(u) −
· 1
& (∀v)

Seq(v) & lh(v) = lh(u) &
 ∀i < lh(u) −· 1

[(u)i = (v)i]

=⇒S wins Hlh(u) −
· 1(u, v)
	
.
Using 6D.1, the relation Min(u) is easily in
G
Γ.

258
6. The playful universe
[6E.2
Call a sequence code ⟨a0, . . . , ak−1, ak⟩best (k even) if it is minimal and if in addition
there is no b < ak so that ⟨a0, . . . , ak−1, b⟩is minimal. Thus
Best(⟨a0, . . . , ak−1, ak⟩) ⇐⇒Min(⟨a0, . . . , ak−1, ak⟩)
& (∀b < ak)[(a0, . . . , ak−1, ak) <∗
k (a0, . . . , ak−1, b)].
Since the relation <∗
k is in
G
Γ, so is the relation Best(u).
Finally we get a
G
Γ-recursive winning strategy for I by putting
ó(a0, c0, . . . , ak−1, ck−1) = ak
⇐⇒(∃a′
0) · · · (∃a′
k)[(∀j < k)Best(⟨a′
0, c0, . . . , a′
j⟩)
& Best(⟨a′
0, c0, . . . , a′
k−1, ck−1, ak⟩)].
⊣
There are many applications of this theorem which we will pursue in the exercises.
For some of them we will need to go into the proof of 6E.1 and use speciﬁcally
the notions of a minimal or a best strategy. It is important to notice that these are
deﬁned for a given game A ⊆N (which I can win) and a given semiscale ϕ on A
independently of any deﬁnability hypotheses; ó is minimal (or best) if each odd initial
segment ⟨a0, . . . , ak⟩of a play following ó is minimal (or best).
Let us just put down here the main corollary of 6E.1 for the Kleene pointclasses.
6E.2. Corollary (Moschovakis [1973]). If Det(Σ
e
1
2n) holds and I wins a Σ1
2n(x)
game A, then I has a winning strategy in ∆1
2n+1(x).
Similarly, if Det(∆
e
1
2n) holds and I wins a Π1
2n+1(x) game A, then I has a winning
strategy in ∆1
2n+2(x).
In particular, granting PD, for each ∆1
n game A either I or II has a ∆1
n+1 winning
strategy, and similarly with ∆1
n(x), ∆1
n+1(x).
Proof. The ﬁrst assertion comes directly from 6E.1, taking Γ = Σ1
2n(x) so that
G
Γ =
G
Σ1
2n(x) = Π1
2n+1(x) by 6D.2 and using the fact that if ó is Π1
2n+1(x)-recursive
then surely ó is in ∆1
2n+1(x).
The second assertion is a trivial consequence of the Basis Theorem 6C.6. If I wins
a Π1
2n+1(x) set A, then the set
P = {ó : (∀ô)A(ó ∗ô)}
is non-empty and in Π1
2n+1(x), so it has a member in ∆1
2n+2(x).
⊣
Taking n = 0 in this corollary, we get in particular that if I wins a Σ1
0 (i.e., a Σ0
1)
game, then I has a ∆1
1 winning strategy. It is not too hard to see this directly, without
the elaborate analysis of games of 6E.1. (Kechris has aptly dubbed this and similar
results strategic basis theorems.)
Exercises
First we put down two simple results which are needed for completeness.
6E.3. Prove that if Γ is adequate and a pointset P of type 1 in Γ admits a Γ-semiscale,
then P admits a very good Γ-semiscale.

As a ﬁrst application of the Third Periodicity Theorem, let us show that Harrison’s
result 4F.1 generalizes to all odd levels.
6E.5 (The Eﬀective Perfect Set Theorem for odd levels, Martin). Assume Det(Σ
e

2n)
and suppose P ⊆X is in Σ1
2n+1 and has at least one member not in ∆1
2n+1; prove that
P has a perfect subset.
Similarly, if P is Σ1
2n+1(z) with some member not in ∆1
2n+1(z), then P has a perfect
subset.
In particular, if P ⊆X is Σ1
2n+1(z) and countable, then P ⊆∆1
2n+1 ∩X.
Hint. If the result holds for subsets of C = ù2 and P ⊆X, let ð : C ֌
→X be a
∆1
1 isomorphism, take Q = ð−1[P] and apply the result to Q to get a perfect subset
K—now use the fact that ð[K] is an uncountable Borel subset of P and hence has a
perfect subset.
If P ⊆C and
P(α) ⇐⇒(∃â)Q(α, â)
with Q in Π1
2n, consider the game G played as in Diagram 6E.4. Here each ui is a
ﬁnite (non-empty binary) sequence
ui = ci
0, . . . , ci
ki,
aj is 0 or 1 and bj ∈ù, so that in eﬀect I and II deﬁne an inﬁnite binary sequence
α = (c0
0, . . . , c0
k0, a0, c1
0, . . . , c1
k1, a1, . . . )
and an irrational
â = (b0, b1, . . . ).
At the end of the game,
I wins ⇐⇒Q(α, â).
Argue that this game is determined since it is essentially in Π1
2n, then argue that if
I wins, then P has a perfect subset.
To complete the proof, we must show that if II wins, then P ⊆∆1
2n+1. Suppose then
that ô is winning for II and α ∈P, ﬁx â so that Q(α, â) and call an initial part of the

and the part is played by ô, i.e.,
a0 = ô(u0),
a1 = ô(u0, a0, b0, u1),
. . . ,
an = ô(u0, . . . , un).
If every good part had a good extension, then ¬Q(α, â), hence some good part has no
good extension, say the one in (∗) above. It follows then that if u0b(a0)b· · ·bunb(an) =

so that α is recursive in ô.
By the Third Periodicity Theorem (and speciﬁcally 6E.4) we may assume that ô is
in ∆1
2n+1, so that P ⊆∆1
2n+1.
⊣
This result is both interesting in its own right and very useful. Here is one immediate
consequence.

2n+1 with compact sections is uniformizable in ∆
e
1
2n+1 by 4F.12
(granting Det(∆
e
1
2n)), but the corresponding generalization of the Arsenin-Kunugui
Theorem 4F.16 is still open. (Kechris and Martin have recently proved this for ∆
e
1
3, but
they use methods that are quite deep and do not generalize immediately to arbitrary
∆
e
1
2n+1.) On the other hand, 4F.19 and the resulting uniformization theorems for ∆

sets with large sections (4F.20) generalize to all odd levels of the hierarchy, essentially
by the same arguments we gave in 4F.19, 4F.20. See Kechris [1973].
We now aim towards a generalization of the Spector-Gandy Theorem 4F.3 to all
odd levels. The proof is new even for Π1
1, and it is in some ways simpler than our
original proof in 4F.3.
6E.7 (The Spector-Gandy Theorem for odd levels, Moschovakis [1973]). Assume
Det(∆
e
1
2n); prove that for every Π1
2n+1 set P ⊆X there is some Π1
2n set R ⊆X ×Y such
that
P(x) ⇐⇒

2n+1(x)

R(x, α).
Hint. Notice ﬁrst that taking Γ = ∆1
2n(x) in 6E.1, Det(∆
e
1
2n) implies that every
∆1
2n(x) game admits a ∆1
2n+1(x) winning strategy for one of the players. Check also as
in 4F.3 that it is enough to prove the result for P ⊆N.
Let
G(e, α) ⇐⇒(∀â)R(e, α, â)
be universal in Π1
2n+1 and choose e0 such that
P(α) ⇐⇒G(e0, α).
Put on G the canonical Π1
2n+1-norm ø which we deﬁned in the proof of the First
Periodicity Theorem 6B.1. Using 4D.14, choose also some ﬁxed k so that
â ∈∆1

because if this failed for some ﬁxed α ∈P, we would have

which implies that ∆1
2n+1(α) ∩N is in ∆1
2n+1(α) contradicting 4D.16.
By the construction in the proof of the First Periodicity Theorem 6B.1 there is a
ﬁxed Π1
2n relation S(α, â, ã) such that whenever G(k, ⟨â, α⟩),
(e0, α) ≤∗

⇐⇒



where for the last equivalence we have used the fact that for (k, ⟨â, α⟩) ∈G, the
set {ã : S(α, â, ã)} is actually ∆1
2n(α, â) and of course we have also used the Third
Periodicity Theorem 6E.1. We now have

(∀ó)S(α, â, ó ∗ô)
which implies the result easily by contraction of quantiﬁers.
⊣
There is a simple but interesting converse to 6E.2.
6E.8. Assume Det(∆
e
1
2n); prove that for each α ∈∆1
2n+1, there is a ∆1
2n set A ⊆N
such that II wins the game (with payoﬀ) A and α is recursive in every winning strategy
for II in A.
Thus ∆1
2n+1 ∩N is the smallest set which is closed under “recursive in” and contains
a winning strategy (for one of the players) for each ∆1
2n game.
Hint. Let H ⊆ù × (ù × ù) be universal in Π1
2n+1 let ø be the canonical Π1
2n+1-
norm that is assigned to H by the First Periodicity Theorem 6B.1 and choose some k0
such that
α(s) = t ⇐⇒H(k0, s, t).
By the Covering Lemma 4C.11, there are ﬁxed integers l0, l1, l2 such that H(l0, l1, l2)
and
α(s) = t ⇐⇒ø(k0, s, t) ≤ø(l0, l1, l2).
It is now obvious from the proof of 6B.1 that (with the ﬁxed k0, l0, l1, l2) there are ∆1
2n
sets P(s, t, α) and Q(s, t, α) such that
(k0, s, t) ≤∗
ø (l0, l1, l2) ⇐⇒II wins {α : P(s, t, α)}
(l0, l1, l2) <∗
ø (k0, s, t) ⇐⇒II wins {α : Q(s, t, α)}.

6. The playful universe
[6E.9
Taking n = 0 here, we have a new game-theoretic characterization of ∆1
1 ∩N as the
smallest set which is closed under “recursive in” and contains a winning strategy for
every ∆0
1 game.
We now turn to the generalization of the largest thin Π1
1 set theorem 4F.4.
6E.9 (The Largest Thin Π1
2n+1 Set Theorem, Kechris [1975]). Assume Det(∆
e
1
2n+1);
prove that for each perfect space X, there is a thin Π1
2n+1 set C2n+1(X) ⊆X which
contains every thin, Π1
2n+1 subset of X.
In particular, if PD holds, then for each n, there is a largest, countable Π1
2n+1 subset
of X.
Hint. Follow the proof of 4F.4 until the point where we have produced a perfect set
F such that
(∀x ∈F )


,
where ë < ä
e
1
2n+1. The last part of the argument in 4F.4 depends on the fact that
ä
e
1
1 = ℵ1 and we must replace it by something more sophisticated when n > 0.
Since F is uncountable and g : F →ù, there exists a ﬁxed k such that g(x) = k for
uncountably many x’s; and the set
{x : x ∈F & R(k, x) & ϕ(k, x) ≤ë}
is ∆
e
1
2k+1 and uncountable, so it must have a perfect
subset, by the hypothesis
Det(∆
e
1
2k+1) and 6A.12. Calling this new perfect set F again, we have
(∀x ∈F )[R(k, x) & ϕ(k, x) ≤ë].
On F we have an obvious ∆
e
1
2n+1 prewellordering,
x ≤y ⇐⇒ϕ(k, x) ≤ϕ(k, y)
such that every initial segment of {y : y ≤x} is countable, since
y ≤x =⇒ϕ(k, y) ≤ϕ(k, x)
=⇒y ∈∆1
2n+1(x)
by the deﬁnition of R(k, x).
We can consider F as a perfect Polish space with the topology induced on it by X,
so by 1A.3 there is a continuous injection
ð : C ֌ F ;
this carries the prewellordering ≤on F to a ∆
e
1
2n+1 prewellordering on C whose initial
segment are again countable and which does not have the property of Baire (as a
subset of C × C) by 5A.10. Our assumption Det(∆
e
1
2n+1) and 6A.16 do not allow such
sets, so we have reached a contradiction and completed the proof of the ﬁrst assertion.
The second assertion follows by 6A.12, since under PD every thin projective set is
countable.
⊣
The hypothesis Det(Σ
e
1
2n) is suﬃcient for this result, see 6G.10 and 6G.11.
Granting PD, we can also ﬁnd largest countable sets at the even levels, but on the Σ
side.
6E.10 (Kechris and Moschovakis [1972]). Assume Det(Σ
e
1
2n+1); prove that for each
perfect product space X, there is a largest countable Σ1
2n+2 subset of X.

6E.12]
6E. The Third Periodicity Theorem
263
Hint. Let C = C2n+1(X × N) be the largest countable Π1
2n+1 subset of X × N and
put
x ∈D ⇐⇒(∃α)C(x, α).
Clearly D is Σ1
2n+2 and countable, since the map (x, α) 7→x is a surjection of C onto D.
If P ⊆X is countable and Σ1
2n+2, choose some Π1
2n+1 set Q ⊆X × N such that
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃α)Q(x, α),
let Q∗⊆Q uniformize Q in Π1
2n+1 by 6C.5 and notice that Q∗must be countable, so
that Q∗⊆C; hence P ⊆D.
⊣
Assuming PD, put
Cn = Cn(N) = the largest countable Π1
n subset of N (if n is odd),
Ck = Ck(N) = the largest countable Σ1
k subset of N (if k even > 0).
Since the property of being countable and Π1
n or Σ1
k is obviously preserved under ∆1
1
isomorphisms, these sets C0, C1, . . . determine the largest countable Π1
n (n odd) and
Σ1
k (k even > 0) sets in all the perfect product spaces.
6E.11 (Kechris [1975]). Assume PD; prove that there is no largest countable Σ1
2n+1
subset of N and there is no largest countable Π1
2n+2 subset of N.
Hint. If A ⊆N is countable and Σ1
2n+1, then A ⊆∆1
2n+1 by 6E.5 above; on the
other hand, if A were the largest countable Σ1
2n+1 set, then ∆1
2n+1 ∩N ⊆A, since for
each α ∈∆1
2n+1 the singleton {α} is obviously Σ1
2n+1. Thus the largest countable Σ1
2n+1
set would have to be ∆1
2n+1 ∩N—and this set is not in Σ1
2n+1 by 4D.16.
The even case is easier: if A ⊆N is countable and Π1
2n+2, then N \ A is Σ1
2n+2 and
non-empty, hence N \ A has a member in ∆1
2n+2 by the Basis Theorem 6C.6, hence
we cannot have ∆1
2n+2 ∩N ⊆A—which the largest countable Π1
2n+2 set would have to
satisfy as above.
⊣
According to these last two exercises, the property of possessing a largest countable
set of irrationals oscillates between the Π and Σ side of the Kleene hierarchy together
with the prewellordering property.
The sets C0, C1, . . . have a very interesting structure which we will not pursue here—
see Kechris [1975].
A result which is somewhat related to the Spector-Gandy Theorem but which is
really mush deeper is the characterization of ∆1
1 sets as precisely the injective, recursive
images of Π0
1 sets; similarly, the Borel sets are precisely the injective, continuous images
of closed sets, see 1G.5, 2E.7, 2E.8, 4A.7 and 4D.9. Before going into the extension
of this to all odd levels (with PD), let us look at a related and basic theorem about the
quantiﬁer
G
.
6E.12 (Moschovakis). Assume that Γ is adequate and ù-parametrized, that every
pointset in Γ admits a Γ-semiscale and that Det(Γ
e
) holds. Prove that every pointset
Q ⊆X in
G
Γ satisﬁes a triple equivalence of the form
Q(x) ⇐⇒(∃ó)(∀α)P(x, ó, α)
⇐⇒(∃!ó)(∀α)P(x, ó, α)
⇐⇒(∃ó)[ó is
G
Γ(x)-recursive & (∀α)P(x, ó, α)],
with P in Γ.

Hint. Choose a good parametrization of Γ as in 3H, and denote (ambiguously)
by G ⊆N × Y all good universal sets, no matter which Y is involved. Deﬁne “best
strategy” for a game A as in the proof of 6E.1 so that if I can win A, then there is
exactly one ó ∈N which is I’s best strategy. Put
R(ε, ó, x) ⇐⇒I wins {α : G(ε, x, α)}
& ó is I’s best strategy for {α : G(ε, x, α)};
this relation is in

is a bijection of N with ùN, replace in this formula each ói by ð(i, ó) and the inﬁnite
string (∃ó0)(∃ó1) · · · by (∃ó) and prove by a standard prewellordering argument that
if there exist ó0, ó1, . . . which are
G
Γ(ε0, x)-recursive and satisfy the
G
Γ matrix above,
then (the unique) ó which codes all the ói = ð(i, ó) is also
G
Γ(ε0, x)-recursive. This
yields equivalences of the form

which are what we need to complete the proof.
Note: The idea for this proof comes from an argument of Solovay.

a

Hint. The argument is an elaboration of the proofs of the Second and Third Peri-

Suppose
Q(x) ⇐⇒(

Given a sequence of norms ϕ0, ϕ1, . . . on P, we can deﬁne a norm ø∗
m on Q∗
m for each
even m using ϕm, by the construction in 6D.3. To recall this and set up notation for
the proof, consider the game Hm(x, u, y, v) for each even m, x, u = ⟨a0, . . . , am⟩, y
and v = ⟨b0, . . . , bm⟩which is played as in Diagram 6E.6. At the end of the game,
S wins the run ⇐⇒(x, α) ≤∗
ϕm (y, â)
and by 6D.3, the norms ø∗
m satisfy
(x, u) ≤∗
ø∗m (y, v) ⇐⇒(x, u) ≤∗
m (y, v) ⇐⇒S wins Hm(x, u, y, v).
Moreover from the formulas of 6D.3, if ϕ = {ϕn} is a Γ-semiscale on P, then ø∗
m is a
G
Γ-norm on Q∗
m and in fact the relations
R(x, u, y, v) ⇐⇒Q∗
m(x, u) & (x, u) ≤∗
m (y, v)
(m = lh(u) −· 1)
S(x, u, y, v) ⇐⇒Q∗
m(x, u) & (x, u) <∗
m (y, v)
are in
G
Γ.
We now assume that P is of type 1 and that ϕ is a very good Γ-scale on P. We will
use the ø∗
m to construct a
G
Γ-scale on Q and then the result will follow by 4E.6.

Let u(i) be the i’th sequence code (essentially) as in the proof of 6C.3, with u(0) =
1 = the code of the empty sequence and so that if u(i) is an initial segment of u(j),
we must have i < j. For each n and each x ∈Q, let w(x, n) be the code of the initial
segment of length 2lh

+ 1 in the game establishing Q(x), where I follows his best
winning strategy and II plays following u(n). To clear this up, suppose
u(n) = ⟨b0, . . . , bk−1⟩;
let a0, a1, . . . , ak be the ﬁrst k + 1 moves of I in the game {α : P(x, α)} where I plays
his best (winning) strategy as we deﬁned it in 6E.1 and set
w(x, n) = ⟨a0, b0, . . . , ak−1, bk−1, ak⟩.
It goes without saying that in deﬁning the best strategy for I we use the scale ϕ. By
the construction in 6E.1 then, the best strategy is minimal so in particular for every
a′
k, if w(x, n) is as above,
(x, ⟨a0, b0, . . . , ak−1, bk−1, ak⟩) ≤∗
2k (x, ⟨a0, b0, . . . , ak−1, bk−1, a′
k⟩).
Finally, if
u(n) = ⟨b0, . . . , bk−1⟩,
choose n0, . . . , nk−1 = n such that
u(ni) = ⟨b0, . . . , bi⟩
(i < k)

where (as always) we use an order-preserving map ⟨· · · ⟩from the alphabetic ordering
of tuples of ordinals into the ordinals. We now proceed to show that ø = {øn} is a
G
Γ-scale on Q.
The deﬁnability part is quite easy and we will omit it.
It remains to check that ø is a scale on Q, so suppose x0, x1, . . . are all in Q,
limi→∞xi = x and all øn(xi) are ultimately ﬁxed for large i; we must show that
x ∈Q and for each n,
øn(x) ≤limi→∞øn(xi).
The hypothesis means in particular that limi→∞w(xi, n) = wn for each n, i.e., the
best strategy for establishing Q(xi) converges as i →∞. We will call this the limiting
best strategy ó∗. In particular
ó∗(∅) = α0 = w(xi, 0)
for all large i.
In addition, all ø∗
2k(xi, wn) are eventually constant. We will assume without loss of
generality that both a0 = w(xi, 0) and ø∗
0(xi, ⟨a0⟩) are ﬁxed for all i ≥0.
We will show that
(x, ⟨a0⟩) ≤∗
0 (x0, ⟨a0⟩);
this will establish in particular that x ∈Q and that

and hence (easily) ø0(x) ≤ø0(xi) for all i. A slight modiﬁcation of the argument
shows that for given b0, . . . , bk−1, if a0, . . . , ak are the ﬁrst k + 1 moves of the limiting
best strategy for the xi, then for all large i,
(x, ⟨a0, b0, . . . , ak−1, bk−1, ak⟩) ≤∗
2k (xi, ⟨a0, b0, . . . , ak−1, bk−1, ak⟩)
from which the result follows easily.
Suppose then that in the game H0(x, ⟨a0⟩, x0, ⟨a0⟩) F starts with a move b0. Suppose
ó∗(a0, b0) = a1
and choose k1 > 0 large enough so that if u(j) = ⟨b0⟩, then øj(xi) is constant for all
i ≥k1. Since also
(xk1, ⟨a0⟩) ≤∗
0 (x0, ⟨a0⟩),
ﬁx a winning strategy for S in H0(xk1, ⟨a0⟩, x0, ⟨a0⟩) and construct Diagram 6E.7 in
the usual way.
In this ﬁrst stage of the construction we see how S can play in his ﬁrst two moves
of the “master game” H0(x, ⟨a0⟩, x0, ⟨a0⟩), by copying α0(1) and then playing a1. The
key moves that allow us to start the next stage are the numbers α1(2) (by the winning
strategy of S in H0(xk1, ⟨a0⟩, x0, ⟨a0⟩)) and b1, which is F ’s next move in the master
game.
To begin with, by the choice of k1 we know that
(xk1, ⟨a0, b0, a1⟩) ≤∗
2 (xk1, ⟨a0, b0, α1(2)⟩)
so ﬁx a strategy for S in the game witnessing this. Also let
ó∗(a0, b0, a1, b1) = a2
and choose k2 so large that if u(j) = ⟨b0, b1⟩, then øj(xi) is constant for all i ≥k2.
By the choice of k1, we have
(xk2, ⟨a0, b0, a1⟩) ≤∗
2 (xk1, ⟨a0, b0, a1⟩)
so we can ﬁx a winning strategy for S in the game witnessing this and construct the
second stage by starting with Fb1 at the top; see Diagram 6E.8.
In this second stage we obtained the moves α0(3) and a2 for S in the master game.
The new key moves that start the third stage are α2(4) and b3 and from then on
we proceed in the obvious fashion.
It is clear that at the end we will have plays
α0, α1, â1, α2, â2, . . . and that the following will hold:

6F. The determinacy of Borel sets(2,3)
By 6A.12, we know that Det(Σ
e
1
1) cannot be established in ZFC, but the next best
result can be proved in this theory: every Borel game is determined.
We prove
here this important result of Martin [1975], [1985], which answered a long-standing
question and lent considerable respectability to the practice of adopting determinacy
hypotheses. Martin’s proof shows, in fact, that Borel games on arbitrary sets X are
determined, and it is easier to explain if we add some structure to our view of games.
It is often convenient to describe a game on a set X by giving a payoﬀset A ⊆ùX
and a set of rules, i.e., a tree T on X. The game G(A, T) speciﬁed by A and T must
proceed along some branch of T, otherwise the ﬁrst player who gets outside T loses.
Formally, I wins a run of the game which results in the play f = (x0, x1, x2, . . . ) if
(∃n)[(x0, . . . , x2n) ∈T & (x0, . . . , x2n, x2n+1) /∈T] ∨(x0, x1, . . . ) ∈[T] ∩A,
i.e., in the notation of 6A, the payoﬀAT of G(A, X) is the set of f ∈ùX which satisfy
this condition; it follows easily, that II wins if
(x0) /∈T ∨(∃n)[(x0, . . . , x2n−1) ∈T & (x0, . . . , x2n−1, x2n) /∈T]
∨(x0, x1, . . . ) ∈[T] \ A.
We describe the strategies for players I and II by the trees of runs played according
to them. Formally, a tree ó ⊆T is a strategy for I if:
1. There is exactly one u0 such that (u0) ∈ó.
2. For all (u0, . . . , u2k+1) ∈ó, there is exactly one y such that
(u0, . . . , u2k+1, y) ∈ó.
3. For all (u0, . . . , u2k) ∈ó and all y, if (u0, . . . , u2k, y) ∈T, then
(u0, . . . , u2k, y) ∈ó.
We let
ΣI(T) = {ó ⊆T | ó is a strategy for I in T}
and we deﬁne ΣII(T) analogously.
We will also need the partial strategies for I and II in G(A, T), which instruct each
player how to play in some initial part of the game: let for any tree T and number n,
T ↾n = {u ∈T : length(u) ≤n + 1} = {(x0, . . . , xi) ∈T : i ≤n},
and set
ΣI
∗(T) = S
m ΣI(T ↾(2m)),
ΣII
∗(T) = S
m ΣII(T ↾(2m + 1)).
For example, if ó ∈ΣI(T), then ó ↾(2m) ∈ΣI
∗(T); but there are partial strategies
which cannot be extended to full T-strategies for I, for example {∅, (a)}, in the tree
{∅, (a), (a, b)}.

6F.1]
6F. The determinacy of Borel sets
273
Notice that the games G(A, T) and G(A∩[T], T) are equivalent in every way: they
have the same full and partial strategies for both players, and if a player wins one of
them then he also wins the other.
Typically we will deﬁne the rules of a game informally, by putting down restrictions
on the choice of xn (by the appropriate player) which depend on the preceding moves
x0, . . . , xn−1. One obtains a tree T from such restrictions in the obvious way,
(x0, . . . , xn) ∈T ⇐⇒for each i ≤n, xi is allowed by the restrictions.
In some cases, the requirement to obey the rules (i.e., the tree T) is more signiﬁcant
for the outcome than the payoﬀset A. For example, II wins G(A, {∅}) for every A,
simply because I cannot make a legal ﬁrst move; and if T = {∅, (a)}, then I wins
G(A, {(a)}) for every A (even A = ∅), because he can make a legal, ﬁrst move, to
which II cannot respond because (a) is a node with no successor. If T is a wellfounded
tree, then G(A, T) is independent of the set A since the loser of a run is determined
before the run is completed—it is the player who is ﬁrst forced to move outside the
tree T. Just above these games in complexity are those in which the payoﬀset A is
clopen, for example A = {x | x0 = 0}; in any run of such a game, whether player I
has a chance to force the run into A is determined at some ﬁnite stage, and after this
the game is completely determined by the tree T, speciﬁcally by whether the player
who has not already lost the chance to get into “his” side of A can keep the play in T
forever, or at least longer than his opponent. Martin’s proof proceeds by “reducing”
in a canonical way every Borel game to games of this type, with clopen payoﬀsets and
complex rules.
6F.1. Theorem (AC, Martin [1975], [1985](3)). For each X ̸= ∅, each tree T on X,
and each Borel set A ⊆ùX, the game G(A, T) is determined, and in particular, every
Borel set A ⊆N is determined.
The plan for Martin’s proof is to introduce a class U ↾ùX of subsets of ùX, for
every X, such that:
(1) If A ∈U ↾ùX then, for every tree T on X, G(A, T) is determined.
(2) Every closed set F ⊆ùX is in U ↾ùX.
(3) U ↾ùX is closed under complementation.
(4) U ↾ùX is closed under countable intersections.
It follows immediately that all Borel subsets of ùX are in U, and hence determined.
Of these four facts, (1) and (3) follow trivially from the deﬁnition of U—which,
however, is quite complex; (2) is the heart of the proof; and the proof of (4) involves
some inescapable technicalities. It is an essential feature of the proof that the argument
for U ↾ùX requires the analysis of U ↾ùY for several Y ̸= X, so that the result really
is about the (generalized) pointclass U.
We will give the deﬁnition of U in stages, starting with the following, most basic of
its ingredients.
A covering c : S ⇝T of a tree T on X by a tree S on Y is a triple
c = (c, cI, cII)
satisfying the following conditions (C1) – (C3).
(C1) c : S →T is a monotone, length–preserving mapping, i.e., for all u ∈S,
length(c(u)) = length(u),

274
6. The playful universe
[6F.2
and if ub(x) ∈S, then c(ub(x)) = c(u)b(y), for some y, We will use the same name
for the induced mapping c : [S] →[T] on the bodies of the trees,
c(f) = S
n c(f ↾n),
which is obviously continuous.
In the typical applications of coverings, Y = X × D for some set D,
c((x0, d0), . . . , (xn, dn)) = (x0, . . . , xn),
and we can think of games in Y as auxiliaries of games in X, in which the players make
side moves in D, witnessing various facts, making deals with their opponent, etc. The
remaining two conditions insure that these auxilliary games on S are “canonically”
equivalent to the games on T with which they are associated.
(C2) The mapping cI : ΣI
∗(S) →ΣI
∗(T) assigns a partial T-strategy cI(ó) for player
I to every partial S-strategy ó for I, so that
ó′ = ó ↾(2m) =⇒cI(ó′) = cI(ó) ↾(2m).
This coherence condition allows us to extend cI to ó ∈ΣI(S),
cI(ó) = S
m cI(ó ↾(2m)).
The idea is that player I can use a partial strategy ó ∈ΣI(S) to play in a game on T,
and in such a way that he can compute his possible moves in T at stage 2m knowing
only the moves in S by ó at stages ≤2m.
We also assume the analogous condition for cII, with 2m + 1 in place of 2m.
(C3) The liftup or simulation condition: for every ó ∈ΣI
∗(S),
u ∈cI(ó) =⇒(∃v ∈ó)[c(v) = u],
and for ó ∈ΣI(S),
f ∈[cI(ó)] =⇒(∃g ∈[ó])[c(g) = f].
Notice that there is no coherence assumption in (C3), i.e., it may happen that
ub(x) ∈cI(ó), u = c(v), but v has no extension which projects to ub(x). This is why
we need to postulate separately the existence of liftups for inﬁnite plays.
We also assume the symmetric condition for II.
We can now formulate the ﬁrst key property we need: a covering c : S ⇝T unravels
a game G(A, T), if the inverse image c−1[A] = c−1[A∩[T]] is a (strong) clopen subset
of the space [S], i.e., for some open and closed C ⊆ùY,
f ∈C ⇐⇒c(f) ∈A
(f ∈[S]).
Notice that if c : S ⇝T unravels G(A, T), then it also unravels G(ùX \ A, T).
6F.2. Lemma (AC). If some c : S ⇝T unravels G(A, T), then G(A, T) is deter-
mined.
Proof. Let B = c−1[A], so that c[B] ⊆A, and the game G(B, S) is determined, by
the Gale-Stewart Theorem 6A.2 because B is closed.
Suppose ﬁrst that ó is a winning strategy for I in G(B, S), and let óT = cI(ó) be
the strategy on T associated with ó by c. To prove that óT is winning, we need only
verify that [óT ] ⊆A, and this follows immediately from the liftup condition (3) on
coverings: because if f ∈[óT], then f = c(g) for some g ∈[ó]; so g ∈B, since ó is
winning in G(B, S); and hence f ∈A since c[B] ⊆A.

6F.3]
6F. The determinacy of Borel sets
275
The same argument shows that every winning strategy for II in G(B, S) induces a
winning strategy for II in G(A, T).
⊣
A covering c : S ⇝T is n-ﬁxing (an n-covering) if it just copies up to stage n,
i.e., S ↾n = T ↾n; if m ≤n, then c((x0, . . . , xm)) = (x0, . . . , xm); if 2m ≤n and
ó ∈ΣI(S ↾(2m), then cI(ó) = ó; and the corresponding condition for ô ∈ΣII(S ↾
(2m + 1)).
If i < n, then every n-covering is also an i-covering.
Finally, a set A ⊆ùX unravels fully if for every tree T, every continuous function f :
[T] →ùX and every k, some k-covering c : S ⇝T unravels the game G(f−1[A], T).
We let
U ↾ùX = {A ⊆ùX : A unravels fully},
so that U is the class of sets in all spaces ùX which unravel fully.
The class U is obviously closed under continuous preimages, and it is also closed
under complementation, simply because if c : S ⇝T unravels G(f−1[A], T), then c
also unravels G(f−1[ùX \ A], T).
The central construction of the proof of Borel determinacy is the next result.
6F.3. Lemma (AC). Every closed set unravels fully.
Proof. Since continuous preimages of closed sets are closed, it is enough to prove
that for every closed F ⊆ùX, every tree T on X and every k, there exists a k-covering
c : S ⇝T which unravels F . We give the detailed argument for k = 0, the general
case being a simple variation.
Fix a tree J such that F = [J].
The precise deﬁnitions of Y = X ×D and the covering c will be easy to extract from
the following description of the rules in the auxilliary game, which runs like this:
I ⟨x0, P⟩
x2
x4
. . .
II
⟨x1, u⟩
x3
x5
. . .
Here are the rules:
(1) Both players must play so that (x0, . . . , xn) ∈T.
This means that there is only one side move by player I in stage 0 and one side move
by player II in stage 1.
(2) In I’s ﬁrst move, P ⊆T and (x0) ∈P.
By making this side move, player I oﬀers to allow II to move “anywhere” in P, if II
promises to keep the play in J. The precise meaning of this oﬀer is embodied in the
last three rules.
(3) In II’s ﬁrst move, either u = 0 or u = (x0, x1, x′
2, x′
3, . . . , x′
2l+1) ∈P \ J.
(4) The side move u = 0, signiﬁes that II accepts I’s oﬀer, which means that from
now on:
(4a) I must play at the position (x0, . . . , x2l−1) so that for every y,
(x0, . . . , x2l, y) ∈T =⇒(x0, . . . , x2l, y) ∈P.
(4b) II must play at each position (x0, . . . , x2l) so that (x0, . . . , x2l+1) ∈J.
(5) A side move u ̸= 0 signiﬁes that II rejects I’s oﬀer, and extracts (for considering
it!) the priviledge of determining the next 2l −1 moves in the run: both players are
now committed to play consistently with the sequence u = (x0, x1, x′
2, x′
3, . . . , x′
2l+1).
(Neither player is restricted in his further moves by P or J in this case.)

276
6. The playful universe
[6F.3
These rules determine the tree S, and the projection mapping is the obvious
c(⟨x0, P⟩, ⟨x1, u⟩, x2, . . . , xn) = (x0, x1, x2, . . . , xn).
The required clopen set is
B = {(⟨x0, P⟩, ⟨x1, u⟩, x2, . . . ) : (x0) ∈P ⊆T & u = 0},
which satisﬁes c−1[F ] = [S] ∩B, because
(⟨x0, P⟩, ⟨x1, 0⟩, x2, . . . ) ∈[S] =⇒(∀n)[(x0, x1, . . . , xn) ∈J]
=⇒(x0, x1, . . . ) ∈F,
and for u ̸= 0,
(⟨x0, P⟩, ⟨x1, u⟩, x2, . . . ) ∈[S] =⇒(x0, x1, . . . ) is consistent with u
=⇒(x0, x1, . . . , ) /∈F,
since u /∈J by Rule (3).
It remains to deﬁne the mappings cI, cII and to verify the liftup condition, and we
do this by describing how I and II can play in T using partial strategies for S.
Case I. Given ó ∈ΣI
∗(S), player I moves (for a while) in T so that
(⟨x0, P⟩, ⟨x1, 0⟩, x2 . . . , xn) ∈ó,
i.e., he assumes, temporarily, that II accepted his oﬀer in the game on S. He can do
this, as long as ó moves so that (x0, . . . , x2l+1) ∈J. If at some stage II moves (for the
ﬁrst time) such that (x0, x1, . . . , x2l+1) /∈J, I revises his assumption and resimulates
II’s ﬁrst move by
(x1, ⟨x1, (x0, x1, . . . , x2l+1⟩),
which is legal, since I’s latest move was legal, and so (x0, . . . , x2l, x2l+1) ∈P. Now
the rules insure that the resimulation is consistent with all the moves in T up to x2l+1,
and I can continue to play so that
(⟨x0, P⟩, ⟨x1, (x0, x1, . . . , x2l+1)⟩.x2 . . . , xn) ∈ó,
consistently, by Rule (5).
It is clear that this construction associates with each ó ∈ΣI(S ↾(2m)) a partial
strategy cI(ó) ∈ΣI(T ↾(2m), so that the coherence and ﬁnite liftup properties hold.
For the inﬁnite liftup property, we simply observe that, if f ∈[cI(ó)], then the ﬁnite
liftups g(2m) of f ↾(2m) converge (because the simulation changes at most once), and
they give us some g ∈[ó] such that cI(g) = f.
Case II. Given some ô ∈ΣII
∗(S), II must simulate some ﬁrst side move by I in order
to play in T, and he chooses (initially) the following:
P = {u ∈T : (for all sets Q ⊆T and all x1)[(⟨x0, Q⟩, ⟨x1, u⟩) /∈ô].
(This, incidentally, is the key trick of the proof.)
Notice that for every u ̸= 0,
(⟨x0, P⟩, ⟨x1, u⟩) /∈ô; because the opposite assumption yields u ∈P, by Rule (2)
(which must be adhered to by ô) contradicting the deﬁnition of P. Suppose now that at
some stage, I moves (for the ﬁrst time) so that, for some x2l+1, (x0, . . . , x2l, x2l+1) /∈P.
By the deﬁnition of P, there exists some Q such that
(⟨x0, Q⟩, ⟨x1, (x0, . . . , x2l+1)⟩) ∈ô,
and II can resimulate I’s ﬁrst move in S by (x0, Q) and can continue to play so that
(⟨x0, Q⟩, ⟨x1, (x0, . . . , x2l+1)⟩, x2, . . . , xn) ∈ô.

6F.6]
6F. The determinacy of Borel sets
277
The construction, again, makes it clear that we only need a partial strategy ô ∈
ΣII(S ↾(2m + 1)) to deﬁne the required cII(ô) ∈ΣII(T ↾(2m + 1)), and that the
coherence and liftup properties hold.
In the proof for arbitrary even k = 2m (which suﬃces) the auxilliary game looks
like
I x0
. . .
x2m−2
⟨x2m, P⟩
x2m+2
. . .
II
x1
. . .
x2m−1
⟨x2m+1, u⟩
x2m+3
. . .
with the crucial side moves at the stages 2m, 2m + 1, and the argument is almost
identical.
⊣
It remains to show that U is clossed under countable intersections, and for this we
need two operations on coverings.
6F.4. Lemma (Composition). For any two coverings
T2 ⇝c1 T1 ⇝c0 T0,
deﬁne the composition c = c0c1 = (c, cI, cII) : T2 ⇝T0 by
c(u) = c0(c1(u)), cI(ó) = cI
0(cI
1(ó)), cII(ó) = cII
0 (cII
1 (ó)).
This is a covering c : T2 ⇝T0, and if c1 and c0 are both k-ﬁxing, then so is c.
Proof is simple, by direct veriﬁcation.
⊣
6F.5. Lemma. The intersection A ∩B ⊆ùX of two sets which unravel fully, unravels
fully.
Proof. Let us just show that for every tree T on X, some c : S ⇝T unravels
G(A ∩B, T).
The hypothesis gives us a covering c0 : T1 ⇝T which unravels G(A, T). Since B
unravels fully, some covering c1 : S ⇝T1 unravels the game
G(c−1
0 [B], T1),
and then the composition covering
c = c0c1 : S ⇝T
unravels A ∩B, because the inverse image
c−1[A ∩B] = c−1[A] ∩c−1
1 [B∗], with B∗= c−1
0 [B]
is the intersection of two clopen sets, and hence clopen.
⊣
To prove that U is closed under countable intersections we need to iterate this
construction an inﬁnite number of times, and this requires the following result about
coverings.
6F.6. Lemma (Inverse limits). If, for each i, ci : Ti+1 ⇝Ti is a (k + i)-covering,
then there exists a tree S and, for each i, a (k + i)-covering di : S ⇝Ti, such that
di = cidi+1.
(1)
Proof. The given chain of coverings
· · · Ti+1 ⇝ci Ti ⇝· · · ⇝c1 T1 ⇝c0 T0,
determines a covering cj,i : Tj ⇝Ti, for every j ≥i:
ci,i = the identity covering
cj+1,i = cj,icj.

278
6. The playful universe
[6F.6
By an easy induction,
cl,icj,l = cj,i
(j ≥l ≥i),
and each cj,i is (k + i)-ﬁxing.
We now set
S = {u : for all suﬃciently large j, u ∈Tj},
which is a tree since every Tj is a tree.
Lemma 1. u ∈S ⇐⇒(∀j > length(u))[u ∈Tj].
Proof . For the non-trivial direction of this, suppose u = (u0, . . . , ui) and j ≥i
and compute:
u ∈S =⇒for some m > j, u ∈Tm
=⇒cm,j(u) ∈Tj
=⇒u ∈Tj because ck,j is j-ﬁxing and length(u) < j. ⊣(Lemma 1)
Lemma 2. If u ∈S and s, t are suﬃciently large (greater than length(u) and i), then
cs,i(u) = ct,i(u).
Proof . This is because, if s < t,
ct,i(u) = cs,i(ct,s(u)) = cs,i(u),
the last step because ct,s is s-ﬁxing and s > length(u).
⊣(Lemma 2)
We can now deﬁne the projection mappings for the required coverings:
di(u) = cj,i(u),
with j > length(u).
These preserve length and they are monotone, because each cj,i has these properties.
For the commutativity condition (1), as far as the projections go, we compute, for all
large j:
ci(di+1(u)) = ci+1,i(cj,i+1(u))
= cj,i(u)
= di(u).
To deﬁne the mapping dI
i : ΣI
∗(S) →ΣI
∗(Ti), verify ﬁrst that
j > 2m + 1 =⇒ΣI(S ↾(2m)) ⊆ΣI(Tj ↾(2m)).
This is because, for ó ∈ΣI(S ↾(2m)),
u ∈ó =⇒u ∈S & length(u) ≤2m + 1 < j
=⇒u ∈Tj
(because length(u) ≤2m + 1 < j),
so that ó ⊆Tj ↾(2m), and by hypothesis, ó is a strategy for I for runs up to the 2mth
stage, so that ó ∈ΣI(Tj ↾(2m)). Moreover, as above, if i < s < t and s, t are both
greater than 2m + 1, the same hypotheses on ó and j imply that for any i ≤j,
cI
t,i(ó) = cI
s,i(cI
t,s(ó)) = cI
s,i(ó),
and so we can deﬁne for any ó ∈ΣI(S ↾(2m)),
dI
i (ó) = cI
j,i(ó)
where j > 2m + 1.
The remaining properties of these mappings and the corresponding facts about dII
i
follow as before and we will not repeat the arguments.

Martin’s Theorem 6F.1 follows from 6F.2 and the next, stronger result.

6F.7]
6F. The determinacy of Borel sets
279
6F.7. Theorem (Martin [1985]). The class U of sets which unravel fully is closed
under countable intersections.
Proof. Since U is closed under continuous preimages, it is enough to show that if
each Ai ⊆ùX unravels fully, A = ∩iAi and T is a tree on X, then, for every k, some
k-covering of T unravels the game G(A, T).
Fix k and start a construction of a chain of coverings
· · · Ti+1 ⇝ci Ti ⇝· · · ⇝c1 T1 ⇝c0 T0,
which will satisfy the hypothesis of 6F.6 by choosing some k-covering
c0 : T1 ⇝T0 = T
which unravels G(A0, T). This means that T1 is a tree on some X1, and for some
clopen set B0 ⊆ùX 1,
f ∈B0 ⇐⇒c0(f) ∈A0
(f ∈[T1]).
(2)
At the i’th stage of the construction we have a ﬁnite chain
Ti+1 ⇝ci Ti ⇝ci−1 · · · ⇝c1 T1 ⇝c0 T0,
and we can deﬁne the coverings cj,l for i + 1 ≥j ≥l ≥0 as in the proof of 6F.6. Let
A∗
i+1 = {f ∈[T]i+1 : ci+1,0(f) ∈Ai+1}.
This is a continous preimage of Ai+1 ∈U, so ﬁx a (k + i + 1)-covering
ci+1 : Ti+2 ⇝Ti+1
which unravels G(A∗
i+1, Ti+1); this means that for some clopen set Bi+1, and all
f ∈[Ti+2],
f ∈Bi+1 ⇐⇒ci+1(f) ∈A∗
i+1
(3)
⇐⇒ci+1,0(ci+2,i+1(f)) ∈Ai+1
⇐⇒ci+2,0(f) ∈Ai+1.
At the end of the construction we have the required chain, and also clopen sets
Bi ⊆∈ùX i+1 such that, putting together (2) and (3), for all i,
f ∈Bi ⇐⇒ci+1,0(f) ∈Ai
(f ∈[Ti+1]).
Let S be the limit tree guaranteed by 6F.6, and let
B = {f ∈[S] : (∀i)[di+1(f) ∈Bi]}.
This is a closed set, so by 6F.3 there is a further k-covering
e : K ⇝S
which unravels it, so that for some clopen set C,
f ∈C ⇐⇒e(f) ∈B
(f ∈[K])
We claim that the k-covering
d0e : K ⇝T0
unravels A, and to prove this it is enough to show that
f ∈C ⇐⇒(∀i)[d0(e(f)) ∈Ai]
(f ∈[K]).
(4)
The key to this is the equation
d0 = ci,0di,

which certainly holds at 0, and, inductively,
d0 = ci,0cidi+1

Using this and the equivalences above, we compute:
f ∈C ⇐⇒e(f) ∈B
⇐⇒(∀i)[di+1(e(f)) ∈Bi]
⇐⇒(∀i)[ci+1,0(di+1(e(f))) ∈Ai]
⇐⇒(∀i)[d0(e(f)) ∈Ai].

6G. Measurable cardinals(10)
Before proving the determinacy of Borel sets, Martin [1970] showed that Det(Σ
e
1
1)
follows from a “large cardinal hypothesis,” the existence of measurable cardinals. Our
main purpose in this section is to deﬁne measurable cardinals and prove this result.
Recall that a ﬁlter on a set X is a collection F of subsets of X such that
(i) ∅/∈F, X ∈F,
(ii) if A ∈F and A ⊆B, then B ∈F,
(iii) if A, B ∈F, then A ∩B ∈F.
For any cardinal number κ, a ﬁlter F is κ-complete if whenever ë < κ and {Aî}î<ë is
a family of ë subsets of X, then
(∀î < ë)Aî ∈F =⇒T
î<ë Aî ∈F.
Finally, F is an ultraﬁlter (maximal ﬁlter) if for each A ⊆X, either A ∈F or
X \ A ∈F.
Each point x0 ∈X determines a principal ultraﬁlter
U(x0) = {A ⊆X : x0 ∈A}
which is obviously κ-complete for every κ.
To get non-principal ultraﬁlters one
generally needs the Axiom of Choice; with it one can prove in fact that every ﬁlter F
on X is contained in some ultraﬁlter, which must be non-principal if F contains all
complements of singletons, e.g., if F = {A ⊆X : X \ A is ﬁnite}.
A cardinal number κ is measurable if κ > ù and some set X of cardinality κ carries
a κ-complete non-principal ultraﬁlter. By the usual conventions of set theory, κ itself
is a speciﬁc set of cardinality κ (the set of ordinals preceding it) and so κ is measurable
exactly when it carries κ-complete non-principal ultraﬁlter.
Let us abbreviate the hypothesis that we will be using:
MC ⇐⇒there exists at least one measurable cardinal.
It is easy to check that MC is equivalent to the assumption that some set carries an
ℵ1-complete, non-principal ultraﬁlter (6G.8).
We cannot hope to prove MC in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory because, as we will
see, it fails in the constructible universe L. On the other hand, although one could
theoretically refute MC, this does not appear likely on the basis of the presently
available evidence. We will discuss the plausibility of MC and similar hypotheses in
Chapter 8.

With each ultraﬁlter U on κ we associate the (two-valued) measure ì = ìU on the
power of κ,
ì(A) =
(
1
if A ∈U
0
if κ \ A ∈U.
If U is κ-complete, then easily ì is κ-additive, i.e., whenever ë < κ and {Aî}î<ë is a
ë-sequence of pairwise disjoint subsets of κ, then
ì(S
î<ë Aî) = P
î<ë ì(Aî).
(To check this take cases on whether some Aî ∈U or not.) Conversely, if ì is a
κ-additive two-valued measure on the power of κ such that ì(κ) = 1 and for each î,
ì({î}) = 0, then Uì = {A : ì(A) = 1} is a κ-complete non-principal ultraﬁlter on κ
and κ is measurable. We will speak interchangeably of ì and U when they are related
in this way—e.g., we will often refer to members of U as sets of measure 1.
For each ultraﬁlter U on κ and for any two functions f, g : κ →κ, put
f ≤g ⇐⇒{î : f(î) ≤g(î)} ∈U.
6G.1. Lemma. If U is an ℵ1-complete ultraﬁlter on κ, then the associated relation ≤
is a prewellordering on the set κκ of functions on κ to κ.
Proof. Clearly f ≤f for each f and since
{î : f(î) ≤h(î)} ⊇{î : f(î) ≤g(î)} ∩{î : g(î) ≤h(î)},
if f ≤g and g ≤h then f ≤h. Also, if ¬(f ≤g), then
{î : f(î) ≤g(î)} /∈U
so that {î : g(î) < f(î)} ∈U, which implies immediately g ≤f. Thus ≤is a
prewellordering. Finally, if
f0 > f1 > · · · ,
then each set
An = {î : fn(î) > fn+1(î)}
is of measure 1 and hence T
n An has measure 1 and in particular T
n An ̸= ∅; for any
ë ∈T
n An then,
f0(ë) > f1(ë) > f2(ë) > · · · ,
which is absurd.
⊣
It follows that with each ℵ1-complete ultraﬁlter on κ we can associate a rank function
ñ : κκ →Ordinals
such that
ñ(f) ≤ñ(g) ⇐⇒{î ∈κ : f(î) ≤g(î)} ∈U.
An ultraﬁlter U (or the corresponding measure ì) on κ is normal if U is non-
principal, κ-complete and such that for each function f : κ →κ,
{î ∈κ : f(î) < î} ∈U ⇐⇒there is a ﬁxed ë0 < κ such that
{î ∈κ : f(î) = ë0} ∈U.
6G.2. Lemma. Every measurable cardinal carries a normal ultraﬁlter.

6. The playful universe
[6G.3
Proof. Let U be a κ-complete, non-principal ultraﬁlter on κ with associated func-
tion ñ and for each ë < κ let Cë be the constant function with value ë,
Cë(î) = ë.
Clearly
ë < ë′ =⇒ñ(Cë) < ñ(Cë′)
so that
ñ(Cë) ≤ë.
If id is the identity function,
id(î) = î,
then for each ë
{î : Cë(î) ≤id(î)} = κ \ ë = T
î<ë(κ \ {î}) ∈U,
so ñ(Cë) ≤ñ(id) and hence
ñ(id) ≥κ.
It follows that for some f0 we must have
ñ(f0) = κ.
Fix such an f0 then and deﬁne U∗by
A ∈U∗⇐⇒f−1
0[A] ∈U
⇐⇒{î : f0(î) ∈A} ∈U.
Proof that U∗is κ-complete and non-principal is routine.
To check that U∗is
normal, suppose {î : f(î) < î} ∈U∗, so that {î : f
 f0(î)

< f0(î)} ∈U. If g is
the composition
g(î) = f
 f0(î)

,
we have ñ(g) < ñ(f0) = κ which implies easily by κ-completeness that for some ë < κ,
{î : f
 f0(î)

= ë} ∈U. By the deﬁnition of U∗then, we have {î : f(î) = ë} ∈U∗
which is what we needed to show.
⊣
Suppose {Aî}î<κ is a κ-sequence of subsets of κ.
The diagonal intersection of
{Aî}î<κ is deﬁned by
ë ∈A ⇐⇒(∀î < ë)[ë ∈Aî].
6G.3. Lemma. Suppose U is a normal ultraﬁlter on κ and each Aî (î < κ) is in U;
then the diagonal intersection A = {ë : (∀î < ë)[ë ∈Aî]} is also in U.
Proof. Assume not, so that (κ \ A) ∈U and for each ë ∈κ \ A choose f(ë) < ë
so that ë /∈Af(ë) (and set f(ë) = 0 for ë ∈A). Now f(ë) < ë on a set of measure 1,
so by normality, f(ë) = ë∗for a ﬁxed ë∗and all ë in a set B of measure 1. But then
B ∩Aë∗has measure 1, so it contains some ë > ë∗, ë ∈κ \ A; this ë then satisﬁes both
ë ∈Aë∗and ë /∈Af(ë) = Aë∗which is absurd.
⊣
After these preliminary results we are ready to state and prove the key partition
property of measurable cardinals which will be our main tool.
For each n ≥1 let
κ[n] = all subsets of κ with exactly n members

and put
κ<ù = all ﬁnite subsets of κ
= S
n κ[n].
A map
F : κ[n] →ë
is often called a partition of κ[n] into ë parts. A subset I ⊆κ is homogeneous for F if
for all A, B ∈κ[n]
A ⊆I, B ⊆I =⇒F (A) = F (B),
i.e., if all the n-element subsets of I are put into the same bin by the partition F .
6G.4. Theorem (Rowbottom [1971]). Let U be a normal ultraﬁlter on κ and suppose
F : κ[n] →ë is a partition of the n-element subsets of κ into ë < κ parts. Then there
exists a set I in U which is homogeneous for F .
Proof is by induction on n with the basis n = 1 being an immediate consequence
of the fact that U is κ-complete.
Suppose then that F : κ[n+1] →ë. For each ﬁxed î < κ, deﬁne a partition
Fî : κ[n] →ë
by the formulas
Fî(A) = F ({î} ∪A)
if î /∈A,
Fî(A) = 0
if î ∈A,
and by the induction hypothesis choose Iî in U to be homogeneous for Fî and put
G(î) = Fî(A) for any n-element A ⊆Iî.
Since G : κ →ë, by κ-completeness easily there is a set J ⊆κ in U and an ordinal
ë0 < ë so that
î ∈J =⇒G(î) = ë0.
Put then
I ∗
î = J ∩Iî
and let I be the diagonal intersection of the I ∗
î ’s,
ë ∈I ⇐⇒ë ∈J & (∀î < ë)[ë ∈Iî].
It remains to verify that I is homogeneous for F .
Given a (n +1)-element A ⊆I , let î be its least member, let B = A\{î} and notice
that B ⊆Iî; this is because if ë ∈B, then ë ∈I and also î < ë, so that ë ∈Iî. Thus
F (B) = Fî(A)
by the deﬁnition of Fî
= G(î)
since î ∈J and A ⊆Iî
= ë0
so that F is constant on the (n + 1)-element subsets of I .
⊣
A map
F : κ<ù →ë
is a partition of the ﬁnite subsets of κ into ë parts. We call I ⊆κ homogeneous for F
if for A, B ∈κ<ù
A ⊆I, B ⊆I and card(A) = card(B) < ℵ0 =⇒F (A) = F (B).

6G.5. Corollary. Let U be a normal ultraﬁlter on κ, and for each i let Fi : κ<ù →ë
be a partition of the ﬁnite subsets of κ into ë < κ parts. Then there exists a set I in U
which is simultaneously homogeneous for all the Fi.
Proof. Deﬁne Fi,n : κ[n] →ë by
Fi,n(A) = Fi(A)
(A ∈κ[n]),
let Ii,n be homogeneous for Fi,n in U and take I = T
i,n Ii,n.
⊣
We will not study partition calculus here, but it will be useful to have around a bit of
notation from this part of combinatorial set theory. For given cardinals κ′ ≤κ, put
κ →(κ′) ⇐⇒for each sequence {Fi}i∈ù of partitions
Fi : κ<ù →ù, there exists a set I ⊆κ of
cardinality κ′ which is homogeneous for all the Fi.
We say that κ is Ramsey if κ →(κ), so that by 6G.5 every measurable cardinal is
Ramsey. (This is equivalent to the more usual deﬁnition of Ramsey cardinals, see
Drake [1974].) All the applications of measurable cardinals to descriptive set theory
follow from the (weaker) consequence of 6G.5, that
κ measurable =⇒κ →(ℵ1);
This is due to Erd¨os and Hajnal [1958].
To simplify the proof of Martin’s theorems, we ﬁrst reformulate the basic represen-
tation theorem for Π
e
1
1 sets, 4A.3.
6G.6. Lemma. If A ⊆N is a Π
e
1
1 set of irrationals, then there exists a function D with
the following properties:
(i) The domain of D consists of all codes u of ﬁnite sequences of even length, i.e.,
{u : Seq(u) & lh(u) is even}.
(ii) If Seq(u) & lh(u) = 2n, then D(u) is an ordering with ﬁeld some set of n integers.
(iii) If t < s, then D
 α(2t)

is a subordering of D
 α(2s)

.
(iv) The following equivalence holds:
α ∈A ⇐⇒S
t D
 α(2t)

is a wellordering.
Proof. By 4A.3 ﬁx a continuous function f : N →N such that for each α,
f(α) ∈LO and
α ∈A ⇐⇒f(α) ∈WO,
and let R be such that
n ≤f(α) k ⇐⇒f(α)(⟨α, k⟩) = 1
⇐⇒(∃s)R
 α(s), n, k

.
If u = ⟨u0, . . . , u2t−1⟩is a sequence code with even length 2t, put
C(u) = {(2n, 2k) : (∃s ≤2t)R(⟨u0, . . . , us−1⟩, n, k) & n, k ≤t}
so that in particular, for each α, t
C

where D1 is a totally ordered subrelation of C
 α(2t)

and let D

obtained as follows. If the smallest

 α(2t + 2)

which is not in the ﬁeld of D
 α(2t)

is
comparable in C
 α(2t + 2)

to every even number in the ﬁeld of D
 α(2t)

, then
extend D
 α(2t)

by adding this number to its ﬁeld and putting it in the appropriate
place. If this fails to hold (or if C
 α(2t + 2)

has the same even numbers in its ﬁeld
as D
 α(2t)

), then extend D
 α(2t)

by adding some unused odd numbers at the top.
It is now easy to check (i) – (iii), and (iv) follows from the fact that for each α,
S

diﬀers from S

only by (possibly) having some odd integers

6G.7. Theorem (Martin [1970]). If there exists a cardinal κ such that κ →(ℵ1),

e
1
1, choose D as in the lemma so that in particular
α /∈A ⇐⇒S
t D
 α(2t)

is a wellordering.
We deﬁne a new game A∗where player II makes additional auxiliary moves in κ as
in Diagram 6G.1. At the end of the run an irrational
α = (a0, a1, . . . )
has been played as well as an inﬁnite sequence of ordinals î0, î1, . . . below κ. For each
t, let

now II wins the run if the map

into the natural ordering on κ.
It is obvious that the game A∗is open, so it is determined. Also, if II wins A∗,
then obviously II wins A since he can play in A with the same strategy he has in A∗
(disregarding his ordinal moves) and at the end he has an order-preserving map from
S

is a wellordering and α /∈A.

Assume then that I wins A∗by some strategy ó∗—we must show that I can also
win A.
Given t distinct ordinals î1, . . . , ît and a sequence code u = ⟨a0, . . . , a2t−1⟩, let
în(1), . . . , în(t) be some ordering of {î1, . . . , ît} and consider the sequence of moves in
Diagram 6G.2 as an initial piece of a play in A∗. Clearly, there is exactly one ordering
of {î1, . . . , ît} so that II has not already lost after these ﬁrst t moves; let us denote it
by
în(u,1), . . . , în(u,t).
Now for each sequence code u = ⟨a0, . . . , a2t−1⟩of length 2t consider the partition
Fu : κ[t] →ù
given by
Fu({î1, . . . , ît}) = ó∗ a0, (a1, în(u,1)), . . . , a2t−2, (a2t1, în(u,t)),

and let J ⊆κ be of cardinality ℵ1 and homogeneous for all these partitions. Finally,
put
ó(a0, a1, . . . , a2t−1) = Fu({î1, . . . , ît})
where u = ⟨a0, a1, . . . , a2t−1⟩and î1, . . . , ît are arbitrary distinct members of J. We
will show that ó is a winning strategy for I in the game A.
In eﬀect we deﬁne ó from ó∗by simulating the ordinal moves of II in A∗in some
homogeneous set J whose members give no information to I in that game.
Suppose then that I follows ó in some run of A and the play
α = (a0, a1, . . . )
results, but α /∈A. Then S
t D
 α(2t)

is a wellordering of countable rank, so if
{x1, x2, . . . } is its ﬁeld, there is some order-preserving map
xt 7→ît
with all the ît in J, since J has cardinality ℵ1. It is now obvious that in the run of
A∗pictured in Diagram 6G.3 player I is following his winning strategy ó∗and yet he
loses, which is a contradiction.
⊣
One can extend this method to prove the determinacy of simple combinations of Σ

6G.8. Prove that if some cardinal carries an ℵ1-complete non-principal ultraﬁlter,
then there exists a measurable cardinal.
Hint. Let κ be the least cardinal which carries an ℵ1-complete non-principal ul-
traﬁlter U and suppose towards a contradiction that for some ë < κ, there are sets
Aç of measure 0 (not in U) such that S
ç<ë Aç ∈U. Pick the least ë for which such
a sequence exists and take Bç = Aç \ S
æ<ç Aæ, so that the Bç are pairwise disjoint of
measure 0 and S
ç<ë Bç ∈U. Now for X ⊆ë, put
X ∈U∗⇐⇒S
ç∈X Bç ∈U
and verify that U∗is ℵ1-complete on ë contradicting the choice of κ.
⊣
We have been referring to “large cardinal hypotheses” but there is no hint in what
we have proved that measurable cardinals are large. In fact it is consistent with the
axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (without the Axiom of Choice) that ℵ1 is
measurable—granting that the hypothesis MC is consistent at all, Jech [1968]. On
the other hand, the Axiom of Choice implies that measurable cardinals are very large
indeed. We will give here only a glimpse of the results that can be proved in this
direction.
Recall that κ is regular if there is no unbounded function f : ë →κ with ë < κ.
Also, κ is strongly inaccessible if κ is regular, and for each ë < κ, card
 power(ë)

=
2ë < κ.
6G.9. Prove that a measurable cardinal is regular and if AC holds, then it is strongly
inaccessible.
Hint. If f : ë →κ is unbounded, then
κ = S
ç<ë{î : î < f(ç)}
and each of the sets in this union has measure 0 by κ-completeness.
Suppose now there is a ë < κ so that κ ≤2ë, where we have used the axiom of
choice in comparing κ with power(ë). There is then an injection
î 7→Xî ⊆ë,
i.e., such that
î ̸= ç =⇒Xî ̸= Xç
=⇒(∃æ < ë)[æ ∈(Xî \ Xç) ∨æ ∈(Xç \ Xî)].
Choose then some function f(î, ç) such that
î ̸= ç =⇒f(î, ç) ∈(Xî \ Xç) ∨f(î, ç) ∈(Xç \ Xî).
Deﬁne now a partition of κ[2] into ë parts by

288
6. The playful universe
[6G.10
F ({î, ç}) =
(
f(î, ç)
if î < ç
f(ç, î)
if ç < î
and using 6G.5, let I ⊆κ be a homogeneous set for this partition, card(I ) = κ.
Now check that we cannot have î1 < î2 < î3 with î1, î2, î3 ∈I without an obvious
contradiction.
⊣
The proof obviously shows that if every partition of κ[2] into ë < κ parts has a
homogeneous set of cardinality at least 3, then 2ë < κ. Much stronger results can be
proved about a measurable cardinal κ—it cannot be the ﬁrst strongly inaccessible, it
must have κ strongly inaccessibles below it, it cannot be the least ë with ë strongly
inaccessibles below it, etc.
In 6A we saw that the hypothesis Det(Λ) implies a good deal of regularity for the
pointsets in Λ. By modifying a bit those proofs, we can establish the same results for
the sets in ∃N Λ, so in particular Det(Σ
e
1
1) (which is equivalent to Det(Π
e
1
1) by 6A.4)
implies that every Σ
e
1
2 pointset P is absolutely measurable, it has the property of Baire
and it is either countable or it has a perfect subset. These regulation results for Σ
e

then follow from the hypothesis that some κ →(ℵ1).
We now give brief outlines of these arguments.
6G.10. (a) (Martin).
Suppose Λ is an adequate pointclass closed under Borel
substitution and assume Det(Λ); prove that every uncountable set P in ∃N Λ has a
perfect subset.
(b) (Solovay [1969]). Infer that if there exists some cardinal κ such that κ →(ℵ1),
then every uncountable Σ
e
1
2 set has a perfect subset.
Hint. It is enough to prove the result for P ⊆N as in 6A.12, so assume
P(α) ⇐⇒(∃â)Q(α, â)
with Q in Λ and recall the game G which we associated with Q in the hint to 6E.5.
Following the same hint, G is determined and if I wins G then easily P has a perfect
subset; if II wins G then any winning strategy ô for II can be used to enumerate P.
The second assertion follows immediately by Martin’s theorem 6G.7.

Σ
e

2 pointset has the property of Baire.
Hint. We will prove that under the hypotheses, each A in ∃N Λ is either meager or
there is an s such that N(s) \ A is meager, from which the result follows by 6A.15.
Suppose
x ∈A ⇐⇒(∃α)Q(x, α)

are the same as in G∗∗; if both players follow the rules to the end, then
I wins the run ⇐⇒Q(x, α)
where x is the unique point in al the basic nbhds N(si) ⊆X and α = (a0, a1, a2, . . . ).

Clearly G is determined and it is easy to see as in 6A.14 that if A is meager then
II wins G. Conversely, if II wins G via ó and Q(x, α) holds, call a sequence s0, . . . , sn
of even length good (for x, α, α) if
s0, s1, α(0), α(1), . . . , α(n −1), α(n −2), sn−1, sn
is the initial part of some play in G in which the restrictions have been obeyed, II has
followed ó and x ∈N(sn). If Q(x, α), then clearly there must be a good sequence
with no good extension; hence,
x ∈A =⇒for some s0, a1, a0, a1, . . . , sn, an−1, an,

and the set on the right is clearly meager. Thus
II wins G ⇐⇒A is meager.

We also claim that
I wins G =⇒for some s, N(s) \ A is meager.
To check this, let s = s0 be the ﬁrst move of I by a winning strategy ó and for any x
call a sequence s0, s1, a0, a1, . . . , sn (n even) good (for x and ó) if it is played by the
rules with I following ó and x ∈N(sn). Easily, if x ∈

then there must be
a maximal good sequence (which may be the one-term sequence s0) or else we would
get a play establishing that Q(x, α) holds for some α; thus

additional moves b0, b1, . . . of I must also be 0 or 1 and we insist that the sets Gn

α = (s0, s1, . . . )

nbhds in ù2 with special properties. Set
G = S

and put
I wins the run ⇐⇒α /∈G & P(α, â).
It is now easy to mimic the proof of 6A.17 and show that if Gì
1 (A, ε) is determined
for each ε > 0 and A has no Borel subsets of ì-measure > 0, then ì(A) = 0.
Assume now the hypotheses on Λ and check ﬁrst that if A ⊆ù2 is in ∃N Λ, then A
can be deﬁne from some P as in (∗) above, using the ∆1
1 isomorphism of ù2 with N.
It follows that for each A ⊆ù2, if A ∈∃N Λ, then the game Gì
1 (A, ε) is determined
and hence if A ∈∃N Λ and A has no Borel subsets of ì-measure > 0, then ì(A) = 0.
Given A ⊆ù2 in ∃N Λ, let C = ù2 \ A and choose a Borel set ˘C ⊇C by 2H.7 so
that ˘C \ C = ˘C ∩A contains no Borel set of ì-measure > 0. Since ˘C ∈∃N Λ, we
then have that ì( ˘C ∩A) = 0 so that C and hence A = ù2 \ C is ì-measurable.
The result holds for arbitrary product spaces X because it is clearly preserved under
Borel isomorphisms.

ematical approach illuminates these theorems from an interesting and very diﬀerent
point of view.
6H. Historical remarks
1As with so many other basic notions of our subject, inﬁnite games were introduced
into descriptive set theory by the Polish mathematicians of the period between the two
world wars. Mazur invented the ∗∗-game (for the reals) and conjectured its connection
with category, 6A.14; Banach veriﬁed the conjecture but did not publish the proof.
(Later Oxtoby [1957] proved a generalization of 6A.14 to arbitrary topological spaces.)
2Gale and Stewart [1953] introduced into the literature the general notion of an
inﬁnite game of perfect information and began a systematic study of these games.
They proved that closed (and open) games are determined and that not all games
are determined and they asked some basic questions, e.g., if all Borel games are
determined.

2) and some time later, Davis [1964] established Det(Σ
e
0
3)
in one of the fundamental early papers on the subject.
For many years this was
the strongest result in the direction of establishing determinacy, until Martin [1970]
proved Det(Σ
e
1
1) granting MC (the hypothesis that there exists at least one measurable
cardinal). Using the new methods introduced by Martin and ideas of Baumgartner,
Paris [1972] established Det(Σ
e
0
4) in ZFC. Finally Martin [1975] completed this circle
of results by proving the determinacy of all Borel sets in ZFC. The argument in
Section 6F is a version of Martin’s considerably simpler, second proof of this basic
result in Martin [1985].
4By 6A.12, Det(Σ
e
1
1) is not a theorem of ZFC, and all proofs of determinacy for
larger pointclasses similarly depend on large cardinal axioms, typically much stronger
than MC; and while determinacy hypotheses cannot directly imply the existence of
large cardinals (larger than some strongly inaccessible), it is often the case that for
reasonable Λ, Det(Λ) is equivalent to the “analytical content” of some natural large
cardinal hypothesis, suitably deﬁned, cf. the remarks at the end of Section 8H. p. 468.
This fundamental connection between two very diﬀerent kinds of extensions of ZFC
was realized gradually through the 1970s, primarily because of work of Martin, but it
developed very rapidly after 1980 and it has produced the deepest and foundationally
most signiﬁcant results of our subject since the ﬁrst edition of this book. For an
expository account and a history of these developments, the reader can consult the
introduction to Neeman [2004] and Steel [2007]. Here we will conﬁne ourselves to a
few remarks, necessarily somewhat vague because we do not have at hand the precise
deﬁnitions of the relevant large cardinal axioms.
Martin [1980] showed that Det(Σ
e
1
2) follows from the existence of a non-trivial, iter-
able elementary imbedding of some Vκ into itself, and later Woodin established PD on
the basis of similar, stronger axioms. These axioms can be viewed as natural extensions
of MC, but they are very powerful, and the proofs of Martin and Woodin created the
impression that PD was also an extremely strong hypothesis, stronger than all the then
known large cardinal axioms. But in fact it is not: the seminal Foreman, Magidor,
and Shelah [1988] (which was not primarily concerned with problems in descriptive
set theory) introduced far-reaching new ideas and techniques and established that
all sets in L(N) are Lebesgue measurable from the existence of a supercompact cardi-
nal, a relatively mild axiom in this context. Following this, Martin and Steel [1988],
[1989] proved PD by assuming the existence of inﬁnitely many Woodin cardinals, an
axiom substantially weaker than the existence of a supercompact cardinal. Combined
with Woodin [1988], this work also shows that a slightly stronger large cardinal hy-
pothesis (still much weaker than the existence of a supercompact) implies that all
sets in L(N) are determined, a powerful proposition which we will discuss brieﬂy in
Section 7D and again in Chapter 8, with the proper deﬁnitions at hand. The Martin-
Steel-Woodin Theorem has been without doubt the most fundamental advance in
descriptive set theory since 1980.
5In addition to proving Det(Σ
e
0
3), Davis [1964] introduced the ∗-game (which he
attributed to L. Dubins) and established the connection of this game with perfect sets,
6A.10 and 6A.11.
6This interpretation of consequences of determinacy hypotheses was considered at
about the same time by Mycielski and Steinhaus [1962], who introduced the false (in

292
6. The playful universe
[6H
ZFC) Axiom of (full) Determinacy
AD ⇐⇒Det
 Power(N)

⇐⇒every subset of N is determined.
They suggested that it may be useful to study an axiomatic set theory in which AC is
replaced by AD, because it excludes peculiar counterexamples—all sets are absolutely
measurable, they have the property of Baire, etc. (Mycielski [1964] further suggested
that AD may be satisﬁed in some universe of sets smaller than the standard collection
of all sets, perhaps one which contains N—which in retrospect may be viewed as
conjecturing the Martin-Steel-Woodin Theorem, proved more than 40 years later.)
7Proofs of the regularity results from AD were given in the sequence of papers
Mycielski [1964], Mycielski and Swierczkowski [1964] and Mycielski [1966]. In our
exposition in 6A we have taken the point of view that these results relate Det(Λ)
with the regularity of the pointsets in Λ, whenever Λ is an arbitrary pointclass with
certain reasonable closure properties. Now 6G.10–6G.12 appear as reﬁnements which
establish the regularity of sets in ∃N Λ from Det(Λ).
8At the same time, the proposal in Mycielski and Steinhaus [1962] to study conse-
quences of the false hypothesis AD has led to a non-trivial and signiﬁcant program.
We will discuss it brieﬂy in 7D. Let us just notice here Solovay’s early result
AD =⇒ℵ1 ia a measurable cardinal,
(7D.18) which witnessed in a spectacular fashion the power of AD beyond descriptive
set theory.
9In the most important single contribution to the theory presented in this chapter,
Blackwell [1967] gave a new proof of the Separation Theorem for Σ
e
1
1 sets which
used the Gale-Stewart Theorem. Addison and Martin instantly saw the possibilities
of this approach and independently established that Det(∆
e
1
2) =⇒Reduction(Π1
3);
then Martin again and Moschovakis (who heard Addison lecture on his results)
proved independently the First Periodicity Theorem 6B.1. These theorems appeared
in Addison and Moschovakis [1968] and Martin [1968] and started the sequence of
results which has led to the present substantial structure theory for the projective sets
and pointclasses on the basis of the hypothesis of Projective Determinacy.
10The few results on measurable and Ramsey cardinals which we covered in 6G are
well-known and we will not attempt to trace their history here; see Drake [1974].
11As we pointed out in the introduction to this chapter, Solovay’s regularity results
about Σ
e
1
2 sets were the ﬁrst applications of the hypothesis MC (or any strong axioms
for that matter) to problems in descriptive set theory.
These were established at
about 1965 and they were very well known among set theorists long before their
(partial) publication in Solovay [1969]; they were instrumental in creating the climate
where the use of strong hypotheses in descriptive set theory became tenable. Solovay’s
proofs were metamathematical (he used forcing) and had a very diﬀerent ﬂavor from
the game-theoretic arguments we gave in 6G.10, 6G.11 and 6G.12. We will come back
to them in Chapter 8.

CHAPTER 7
THE RECURSION THEOREM
Kleene’s Recursion Theorem is a very simple fact with remarkably broad and impor-
tant consequences. Combined with techniques also pioneered by Kleene, it allows
us in eﬀect to deﬁne recursive partial functions by transﬁnite recursion and to obtain
uniform versions of many results, in the sense of 3H.
After proving the Recursion Theorem in a wide context in 7A, we will use it in 7B to
establish the Suslin-Kleene Theorem, the central result of the eﬀective theory. In 7C we
will consider brieﬂy the general theory of inductive deﬁnability (of relations) and in 7D
we will look at some of the consequences of the so-called Axiom of (full) Determinacy.
It is perhaps an indication of the signiﬁcance of the Recursion Theorem that this
section on full determinacy come in this chapter; as it happens, one of the key lemmas
in this most set theoretic part of our subject depends on the Recursion Theorem for
its proof.
7A. Recursion in a Σ∗-pointclass
Let us call for convenience Γ a Σ∗-pointclass if it is a Σ-pointclass which is ù-
parametrized and has the substitution property, as in 3G—these are the pointclasses
which carry a very smooth theory of Γ-recursion.
For each space X, let
GX×ù
Γ
= G ⊆N × X × ù
be the ﬁxed (good) universal set for the Γ
e
-subsets of X × ù and for each Y deﬁne the
partial function
U X,Y
Γ
= U : N × X ⇀Y
as follows:
U(ε, x)↓⇐⇒there exists a unique y ∈Y such that
(∀s)[y ∈Ns ⇐⇒G(ε, x, s)],
U(ε, x) = the unique y such that (∀s)[y ∈Ns ⇐⇒G(ε, x, s)];
in other words, U is the largest partial function on X to Y which is computed on its
domain by G. Finally, for each ε ∈N deﬁne the partial function
{ε}X,Y
Γ
= {ε} : X ⇀Y
by
{ε}(x) = U(ε, x).
(Sometimes ϕε of fε is used for {ε} but Kleene’s original notation is well established
and really easier to use in the long run.)

7. The recursion theorem
[7A.1
We will always omit the cumbersome superscripts and subscripts X, Y, Γ, unless
they are necessary for clarity.
7A.1. Theorem (Kleene). Let Γ be a ﬁxed Σ∗-pointclass.
(i)] For each X, Y, the partial function
U X,Y
Γ
= U : N × X ⇀Y
is Γ-recursive on its domain.
(ii) A partial function f : X ⇀Y is Γ
e
-recursive on its domain, if and only if there is
some ε ∈N such that f ⊆{ε}, i.e.,
f(x)↓=⇒f(x) = {ε}(x).
(iii) A partial function f : X ⇀Y is Γ-recursive on its domain, if and only if there is
some recursive ε ∈N such that f ⊆{ε}, i.e.,
f(x)↓=⇒f(x) = {ε}(x).
(iv) For each space X of type 0 or 1 and each W, Y, there is a recursive function
SX,W,Y
Γ
= S : N × X →N
such that for all ε ∈N, x ∈X,
{ε}(x, w) = {S(ε, x)}(w).
Proof. (i) is immediate and (ii) and (iii) follow trivially from the properties of a
good parametrization, 3H.1. To prove (iv), let
S : N × X →N
be chosen by 3H.1 so that for all ε, x, w, s,
G(ε, x, w, s) ⇐⇒G
 S(ε, x), w, s

.
⊣
The Recursion Theorem follows from this result by a simple (if somewhat subtle)
diagonalization argument.
7A.2. Kleene’s Recursion Theorem.(1) Let Γ be a Σ∗-pointclass and suppose
f : N × X ⇀Y
is Γ
e
-recursive on its domain; then there exists a ﬁxed ε∗∈N such that for all x ∈X,
f(ε∗, x)↓=⇒[f(ε∗, x) = {ε∗}(x)].
(∗)
In fact, there is a ﬁxed recursive function R(α) depending only on the spaces X, Y so
that if α is a code of f in the sense that
f(ε, x)↓=⇒f(ε, x) = {α}(ε, x),
then we can take
ε∗= R(α)
in (∗).
In particular, if f is Γ-recursive on its domain, then we can ﬁnd a recursive ε∗which
satisﬁes (∗).

7A.3]
7A. Recursion in a Σ∗-pointclass
295
Proof. Given X and Y, deﬁne
g : N × N × X ⇀Y
by
g(â, α, x) = {α}
 S(â, â, α), x

,
where
S : N × (N × N) →N
is recursive and satisﬁes (iv) of 7A.1. Clearly g is Γ-recursive on its domain, so by 7A.1
there is a ﬁxed recursive ε0 so that
g(â, α, x)↓=⇒g(â, α, x) = {ε0}(â, α, x) = {S(ε0, â, α)}(x)
by the key property of the function S. Taking â = ε0 in this implication, we obtain
{α}
 S(ε0, ε0, α), x

= {S(ε0, ε0, α)}(x)
and we can satisfy (∗) by setting
ε∗= R(α) = S(ε0, ε0, α).
⊣
The Recursion Theorem has been described as a ﬁxed point theorem for maps on
the collection of Γ-recursive partial functions which are uniform in the coding for
these objects introduced in 7A.1.
This point of view is a little artiﬁcial when we
consider partial functions whose domain is not in Γ, but in any case, the applications
of the theorem are hard to couch in topological terms. They tend rather to exhibit a
connection between this result and deﬁnition by recursion as the next result plainly
shows.
7A.3. Theorem. If Γ is a Σ∗-pointclass, then the collection of Γ-recursive (total)
functions is closed under primitive recursion.
Proof. We are given total Γ-recursive maps
g : X →Y
h : Y × ù × X →Y,
and we deﬁne
f : ù × X →Y
by the recursion

f(0, x) = g(x)
f(m + 1, x) = h
 f(m, x), m, x

.
To see that f is also Γ-recursive, let
ϕ(ε, m, x) =
(
g(x),
if m = 0,
h
 {ε}(m −1, x), m −1, x

,
if m > 0,
where
{ε}(k, x) = U(ε, k, x)
is Γ-recursive on its domain as a function of ε, k, x by 7A.1. It is easy to check (using
the substitution property) that ϕ is Γ-recursive on its domain, so by the Recursion
Theorem there is a ﬁxed recursive ε∗so that
ϕ(ε∗, m, x)↓=⇒[ϕ(ε∗, m, x) = {ε∗}(m, x)].

296
7. The recursion theorem
[7A.4
For this ε∗, then we have
{ε∗}(0, x) = g(x),
{ε∗}(m + 1, x) = H
 {ε∗}(m, x), m, x

which implies by a trivial induction on m that {ε∗}(m, x) is always deﬁned and for
each m, x,
{ε∗}(m, x) = f(m, x).
Now f is Γ-recursive by 7A.1, since ε∗is recursive.
⊣
We will see in the exercises that the collection of partial functions which are Γ-
recursive on their domain is also closed under primitive recursion (when Γ is a Σ∗-
pointclass), but this simple result already shows the power of the Recursion Theorem.
Even for the simple case Γ = Σ0
1 of ordinary recursion, this is the simplest known
proof of 7A.3 (for functions into spaces Y which are not of type 0).
Exercises
Let us ﬁrst consider a simple case of deﬁnition by eﬀective transﬁnite recursion.
Suppose ≺is a (strict) wellfounded relation with Field(≺) ⊆X and
f : Field(≺) →Y
is deﬁned by recursion on ≺, i.e., f satisﬁes the equation
f(x) = G
 u, f(u)

: u ≺x
	
, x

(1)
which determines it uniquely on Field(≺) (by induction). Now the map G is deﬁned
on
Domain(G) =

(h, x) : x ∈Field(≺) and h : X ⇀Y is a partial
function with Domain(h) = {u : u ≺x}
	
;
we will say that G is Γ-eﬀective (Γ a Σ∗-pointclass) if there is a partial function
g : N × X ⇀Y
which is Γ-recursive on its domain and such thatfor each ε ∈N and each x ∈Field(≺),
(∀u)[u ≺x =⇒{ε}(u)↓]
=⇒g(ε, x)↓& g(ε, x) = G
 u, {ε}(u)

: u ≺x
	
, x

.
If f is deﬁned by (1) with a Γ-eﬀective G, we say that f is deﬁned by Γ-eﬀective
recursion on ≺.
7A.4 (Kleene.(1)). Show that if Γ is a Σ∗-pointclass and f : X ⇀Y is deﬁned by
Γ-eﬀective recursion on some wellfounded relation ≺such that Field(≺) ⊆X, then f
is Γ-recursive on Field(≺).
Hint. Let g “compute” G as above and and choose a recursive ε∗∈N by the
Recursion Theorem so that
g(ε∗, x)↓=⇒{ε∗}(x) = g(ε∗, x);
now show by induction on x ∈Field(≺) that f(x) = {ε∗}(x).
⊣

7A.6]
7A. Recursion in a Σ∗-pointclass
297
Notice that there are no eﬀectivity hypotheses on the relation ≺in this result and in
fact we can obtain ε∗in the proof directly from g, with no knowledge of the relation ≺;
this is important in more subtle applications of this method where we deﬁne ε∗before
we even know that ≺is wellfounded and then show that it has whatever properties we
need if the relevant relation ≺happens to be wellfounded.
7A.5. Prove that if Γ is a Σ∗-pointclass, then the collection of partial functions which
are Γ-recursive of their domain is closed under both minimalization and primitive
recursion.
Hint. One must be a bit careful with the deﬁnitions. For minimalization,
ìi[g(x, i) = 0] = w ⇐⇒g(x, w) = 0 & (∀i < w)(∃j)[g(x, i) = j + 1]
and the argument uses only the assumption that Γ is a Σ-pointclass. For primitive
recursion we must understand the basic equations literally for partial functions g, h,
f(0, x) = g(x),
f(m + 1, x) = h
 f(m, x), m, x

,
so that for example if f(m, x)↓, we must have f(0, x), . . . , f(m −1, x) all deﬁned.
The proof is the same as that of 7A.3.
⊣
It is occasionally useful (particularly in the eﬀective theory) to give a coding in ù
for the partial functions which are Γ-recursive on their domain. Fix a Σ∗-pointclass Γ
then and choose GX ⊆ù × X for each X to be universal for Γ ↾X by 3H.3, so that
the parametrization system {GX} is good. Using the same notation as in the case of
parametrizations in N (no conﬂict can arise), deﬁne the partial function
U X,Y
Γ
= U : ù × X ⇀Y
by
U(e, x)↓⇐⇒there exists a unique y ∈Y such that
(∀s)[y ∈Ns ⇐⇒G(e, x, s)],
U(e, x) = the unique y such that (∀s)[y ∈Ns ⇐⇒G(e, x, s)]
and for each e ∈ù, deﬁne the partial function
{e}X,Y
Γ
= {e} : X ⇀Y
by
{e}(x) = U(e, x).

as above.

(ii) Show that a partial function f : X ⇀Y is Γ-recursive on its domain if and only
if there is some e ∈ù so that
f(x)↓=⇒f(x) = {e}(x).
(iii) Show that for each space X of type 0 and all W, Y, there is a recursive function
SX,W,Y
Γ
= S : ù × X →ù
such that for all e ∈ù, x ∈X,
{e} = {S(e, x)},

298
7. The recursion theorem
[7B
i.e., for all e ∈ù, x ∈X, w ∈W,
{e}(x, w) = {S(e, x)}(w).
(iv) Show that if f : ù × X ⇀Y is Γ-recursive on its domain, then there exists
some e∗∈ù so that for all x ∈X,
f(e∗, x)↓=⇒[f(e∗, x) = {e∗}(x)];
in fact we can take e∗= r(a) where r is a ﬁxed recursive function (depending only on
X, Y) and a is any member of ù such that
f(e, x)↓=⇒f(e, x) = {a}(e, x).
Hint. Follow the proofs of 7A.1 and 7A.2.
⊣
In the simple case Γ = Σ0
1 and on spaces of type 0, this result gives Kleene’s original
calculus of recursive partial functions.
7B. The Suslin-Kleene Theorem
The key ingredient in the proof of this central result of the eﬀective theory is the
method of deﬁnition by eﬀective transﬁnite recursion which we described ﬁrst in 7A.4.
In fact the “constructive proof” of the Strong Separation Theorem 2E.1 which we
gave in Chapter 2 deﬁnes the separation sets by an eﬀective recursion and all we have
to do here is to recast that argument in the language of codings.
Let us ﬁrst introduce a new coding of Borel sets which is somewhat easier to work
with than the coding of 3H. In this deﬁnition and in the rest of this section recursive
always means Σ0
1-recursive, i.e.,
{ε}(x) = {ε}Σ0
1(x).
We deﬁne by recursion on the countable ordinal î the set BCî of Borel Codes for Σ0
î
as follows:
BC0 = {α : α(0) = 0},
BCî =

α : α(0) = 1 & (∀n)[{α⋆}(n)↓& {α⋆}(n) ∈S
ç<î BCç]
	
,
if î > 0, where
α⋆(t) = α(t + 1)
and {α⋆} : ù ⇀N is the partial function of 7A which is (Σ0
1-) recursive on its domain.
For each ﬁxed space X and each î, we deﬁne the coding
ðcX
î : BCî ։ Σ0
î ↾X
by the recursion
ðcX
0 (α) = N
 X, α(1)

,
ðcX

where
ç(n) = least ç so that {α⋆}(n) ∈BCç.

7B.1]
7B. The Suslin-Kleene Theorem
299
Finally, put
BC = S
î BCî = the set of Borel codes,
ðcX = S
î ðcX
î .
We will call ðcX(α) the set with Borel code α.
In addition to starting with the basic nbhds rather than arbitrary open sets, this
coding diﬀers from that of 3H in the way we choose to code inﬁnite sequences of
irrationals: instead of the simple mapping
α 7→(α)0, (α)1, (α)2, . . . ,
we took
α 7→{α⋆}(0), {α⋆}(1), {α⋆}(2), . . .
which depends on the messy basic deﬁnitions of Σ0
1-recursion and is not deﬁned for
all α. There are technical advantages to this new coding which will become clear
soon—and it is equivalent to the coding of 3H as we will show in 7B.8.
Let us ﬁrst prove a couple of simple lemmas about this coding.
7B.1. Lemma. (i) ç ≤î =⇒BCç ⊆BCî & ðç = ðî ↾BCç, so that ð is a coding of
the Borel subsets of X with BC the set of codes.
(ii) The class of Borel subsets of X is uniformly closed under complementation, count-
able union and countable intersection in the following precise sense.
(a) There is a recursive function u1(α) such that if α is a Borel code of some A ⊆X,
then u1(α) is a Borel code of X \ A.
(b) There is a recursive function u2(ε) such that if for each i, {ε}(i)↓and {ε}(i) is a
Borel code of some set Ai ⊆X, then u2(ε) is a Borel code of S
i Ai.
(c) There is a recursive function u3(ε) such that if for each i, {ε}(i)↓and {ε}(i) is a
Borel code of some set Ai ⊆X, then u3(ε) is a Borel code of T
i Ai.
(iii) If P ⊆X × Y is in Σ0
n or Π0
n and X is of type ≤1, then there is a recursive function
u4 : X →N such that for each x, u4(x) is a Borel code of the section Px = {y : P(x, y)}.
Proof. (i) is immediate by induction on î.
For (ii) (a) choose a recursive ε1 so that
ε1(α, t) = α
(for all t ∈ù, α ∈N)
and deﬁne
è1(α) = (1)bS(ε1, a);
now if u1(α) = â, then â(0) = 1 and â⋆= S(ε1, a) so that if α codes A, then for all i
{â⋆}(i) = {S(ε1, a)}(i) = α
and hence â codes S
i(X \ A) = X \ A.
Similarly, for (ii) (b), choose a recursive ε2 so that for all ε, t
{ε2}(ε, t) = u1
 {ε}(t)

and let
u2(ε) = (1)bS(ε2, ε);
nowifε satisﬁes the hypothesis, so each {ε}(i)is a Borel code ofAi, then {S(ε2, ε)}(i) =
u1
 {ε}(i)

is a Borel code of X \ Ai for each i and hence u2(ε) is a Borel code of
S
i
 X \ (X \ Ai)

= S
i Ai.
The construction for part (c) is similar.

7. The recursion theorem
[7B.2
To prove (iii) by induction on n, suppose ﬁrst that P(x, y) is Σ0
1 with X of type 0 or 1.
By 3C.5 now (considering {(y, x) : P(x, y)}) easily, there is a recursive P∗⊆X × ù2
so that
P(x, y) ⇐⇒(∃t){y ∈N(Y, t) & (∃u)P∗(x, t, u)}
and contracting quantiﬁers,
P(x, y) ⇐⇒(∃s)

y ∈N
 Y, (s)0

& P∗ x, (s)0, (s)1
	
.
Put now
f(x, s) = (i 7→0)
if
¬P∗ x, (s)0, (s)1

,
and if P∗ x, (s)0, (s)1

holds, let
f(x, s) = âx,s
where
âx,s(0) = 0,
âx,s(i + 1) = (s)0.
Clearly f is recursive; if ˆf ∈N is e recursive code for f so that
f(x, s) = { ˆf}(x, s)
= {S( ˆf, x)}(s),
then easily for each s, {S( ˆf, x)}(s) is a Borel code of some nbhd N X,s ⊆Y and
Px = S
s N X,s;
thus we can take
u4(x) = u2
 S( ˆf, x)

.
The induction step is even easier using u1 and u3.
⊣
The second lemma is also quite simple but its proof illustrates the use of deﬁnitions
by eﬀective transﬁnite recursion.
Let us call a map
ð : X →Y
eﬀectively Borel (or Borel in the coding) is a recursive function v : ù →N such that
for each s, v(s) is a Borel code for ð−1[N(Y, s)].
7B.2. Lemma. (i) For each product space X, there is an eﬀectively Borel and ∆1
1-
recursive injection
ð∗: X ֌ N.
(ii) If ð : X →Y is eﬀectively Borel, then there is a recursive function u : N →N
such that whenever α is a Borel code of some A ⊆Y, then u(α) is a Borel code of ð−1[A].
Proof. (i) Go back to the proof of 1G.2 and take for ð∗the g deﬁned there.
Recalling that deﬁnition,
ð∗(x) = α,
where
α(n) = least k such that d(x, rk) ≤2−n−2
so that ð∗is easily an injection, and if
Bn,k = {α : α(n) = k},
then
ð−1
∗[Bn,k] = {x : d(x, rk) ≤2−n−2} ∩{x : (∀j < k)d(x, rj) > 2−j−2};

7B.2]
7B. The Suslin-Kleene Theorem

thus the set
P(n, k, x) ⇐⇒ð∗(x) ∈Bn,k
is easily Π0
2 and by 7B.1 there is a recursive v1 so that v1(n, k) is a Borel code of
ð−1∗[Bn,k]. From this it is easy to get a recursive v witnessing that ð∗is eﬀectively
Borel using again 7B.1.
(ii) If v witnesses that ð is eﬀectively Borel, we clearly want to put
u(α) = v
 α(1)

,
if
α(0) = 0,
but we need a transﬁnite recursion to deﬁne u(α) for Borel codes α with α(0) = 1.
We will deﬁne u by the Recursion Theorem, i.e., we will put
u(α) = {ε∗}(α)
where {ε}(α) is deﬁned for ordinary (Σ0
1-) recursion and ε∗is a recursive irrational so
that for a suitable h,
h(ε∗, α)↓=⇒{ε∗}(α) = h(ε∗, α);
in fact h will be total recursive, so that u will also be total.
Having decided on this plan of the proof, we are left with a simple coding problem
in deﬁning h.
Deﬁne g by
g(ε, α, t) = {ε}
 {α⋆}(t)

and let ˆg be a recursive irrational so that

if α(0) = 0,
(1)bS( ˆg, ε, α)
if α(0) ̸= 0,
and choose a recursive ε∗so that
h(ε∗, α) = {ε∗}(α).
We claim that the function
u(α) = {ε∗}(α)
has the required properties.
To check this, we establish by induction on î that if α ∈BCî and α codes the set
A = ðcY(α), then u(α) codes the set ð−1[A] ⊆Y.
The result is immediate for î = 0 by the choice of v.
Assuming î > 0 if α ∈BCî, then α(0) = 1 and α codes the set
A = S

where for each n, {α⋆}(n) codes An and {α⋆}(n) ∈S

⊣
We wrote this proof up in full detail to illustrate the method—quite often in the
future we will simply summarize the key ideas involved and leave out the details.
Let us now turn to the key result of this section.
It is convenient here to deﬁne a tree T on ù × ù as a set of sequence codes (in ù)

⟨t0, î0⟩, . . . , ⟨tn−1, în−1⟩

of ﬁnite sequences of pairs of integers closed under initial
segments. Let us say that an irrational ô ∈N codes the tree T if

⟨t0, î0⟩, . . . , ⟨tn−1, în−1⟩

∈T ⇐⇒ô
 
⟨t0, î0⟩, . . . , ⟨tn−1, în−1⟩

= 1.
Similarly for a tree J on ù × ù × ù; α codes J, if

⟨t0, î0, ç0⟩, . . . , ⟨tn−1, în−1, çn−1⟩

∈J
⇐⇒α
 
⟨t0, î0, ç0⟩, . . . , ⟨tn−1, în−1, çn−1⟩

= 1.
It is clear that any code ô (or α) determines completely the tree T (or J).
As in Chapter 2, the projection p[T] of tree T on ù × ù is a subset of N,
p[T] =

α : (∃f ∈ùù)(∀n)

⟨α(0), f(0)⟩, . . . , ⟨α(n −1), f(n −1)⟩

∈T
	
.
7B.3. The Eﬀective Strong Separation Theorem. There is a recursive function
u : N × N →N such that whenever ô and ó code respectively trees T and S with
p[T] ∩p[S] = ∅,
then u(ô, ó) is a Borel code of some set C which separates p[T] from p[S], i.e.,(2)
p[T] ⊆C,
C ∩p[S] = ∅.
Proof. Following closely the constructive proof of 2E.1, let us associate with any
two trees of pairs T and S on ù × ù the tree of triples J,

⟨t0, î0, ç0⟩, . . . , ⟨tn−1, în−1, çn−1⟩

∈J
⇐⇒

⟨t0, î0⟩, . . . , ⟨tn−1, în−1⟩

∈T &

⟨t0, ç0⟩, . . . , ⟨tn−1, çn−1⟩

∈S.
To simplify notation, let f(u), h(u) be recursive functions such that if
u =

⟨t0, î0, ç0⟩, . . . , ⟨tn−1, în−1, çn−1⟩

,
then
f(u) =

⟨t0, î0⟩, . . . , ⟨tn−1, în−1⟩

,
h(u) =

⟨t0, ç0⟩, . . . , ⟨tn−1, çn−1⟩

.
(Notice that throughout this argument the variables îi, çj vary over ù, as the κ of 2E.1
is ù here.)
Now if ô and ó code trees T and S, a code of J is easily j(ô, ó) where j is a ﬁxed
recursive function such that
j(ô, ó)(u) = 1 ⇐⇒ô
 f(u)

= 1.
As in 2E.1, let
Av = p[Tv],
Bv = p[Sv],

7B.3]
7B. The Suslin-Kleene Theorem
303
where v varies over sequence codes. Clearly
A = p[T] = p[T1],
A = p[S] = p[S1],
recalling that 1 = ⟨⟩codes the empty sequence.
We aim to deﬁne a recursive function
u∗: N × N × ù →N
such that whenever ô and ó code trees T and S with p[T] ∩p[S] = ∅and u =

⟨t0, î0, ç0⟩, . . . , ⟨tn−1, în−1, çn−1⟩

, then u∗(ô, ó, u) is a Borel code of a set
Cu = C(ô, ó, u)
which separates p[Tf(u)] from p[Sh(u)]. The proof will be completed by taking
u(ô, ó) = u∗(ô, ó, 1).
The deﬁnition of u∗will be by the Recursion Theorem, i.e., we will take
u∗(ô, ó, u) = {ε∗}(ô, ó, u),
where {ε∗} is deﬁned for ordinary (Σ0
1-) recursion and ε∗is a recursive irrational,
chosen so that
g(ε∗, ô, ó, u)↓=⇒{ε∗}(ô, ó, u) = g(ε∗, ô, ó, u);
in fact g will be a total recursive function, so that u∗will also be total.
In the proof of 2E.1, the sets Cu were deﬁned by bar recursion on the tree J
determined by T and S which is wellfounded when p[T] ∩p[S] = ∅. Here, obviously
we must choose g so that (when ô and ó code trees T and S with p[T] ∩p[S] = ∅) it
proves that this bar recursion is eﬀective in the sense of 7A. Of course, the deﬁnition
must make sense for arbitrary ô, ó, u so that we get a total recursive function.
With this plan of attack, it is only a simple matter of manipulating the coding
to deﬁne g. Let us ﬁrst prove a lemma that reduces the construction of a code for
C(ô, ó, u) to constructing codes for the sets Dt,î,s,ç in the proof of 2E.1.
Lemma. There is a recursive function v(ε) such that if {ε}(t, î, s, ç) is deﬁned for
each t, î, s, ç and codes a Borel set Dt,î,s,ç, then v(ε) is a Borel code of the set
S
t,î
T
s,ç Dt,î,s,ç.
Proof. Recall the recursive function u2 and u3 of 7B.1 which construct codes for
countable unions and intersections of Borel sets and deﬁne the recursive functions v1,
v2, v3,
v1(ε, t, î, s) = u3
 S(ε, t, î, s)

,
v2(ε, t, î) = u3
 S(ˆv1, ε, t, î)

,
v3(ε, t) = u2
 S(ˆv2, ε, t)

,
v(ε) = u2
 S(ˆv3, ε)

,
where ˆv1, ˆv2, ˆv3 are recursive irrationals successively chosen so that
v1(ε, t, î, s) = {ˆv1}(ε, t, î, s),
v2(ε, t, î) = {ˆv2}(ε, t, î),
v3(ε, t) = {ˆv3}(ε, t).

304
7. The recursion theorem
[7B.3
Assuming now that ε satisﬁes the hypotheses,
{S(ε, t, î, s)}(ç) = {ε}(t, î, s, ç)
codes Dt,î,s,ç for each ç, hence
v1(ε, t, î, s) = u3
 S(ε, t, î, s)

codes T
ç Dt,î,s,ç; but
v1(ε, t, î, s) = {S(ˆv1, t, î)}(s),
so that
v2(ε, t, î) = v3
 S(ˆv1, t, î)

codes T
s
T
ç Dt,î,s,ç = T
s,ç Dt,î,s,ç. Continuing the same argument, we easily check
that v(ε) codes the required set.
⊣(Lemma)
Going back to the proof of the theorem, let us deﬁne (by cases) a partial function
d(ε, ô, ó, u, t, î, s, ç) so that the following hold. (After ε is ﬁxed by the Recursion
Theorem, d(ε, ô, ó, u, t, î, s, ç) will give a Borel code of the set Dt,î,s,ç in the proof
of 2E.1.)
(1) If t = s and j(ô, ó)(u ∗⟨t, î, ç⟩) = 1, then
d(ε, ô, ó, u, t, î, s, ç) = {ε}(ô, ó, u ∗⟨t, î, ç⟩).
(2) If t ̸= s, then
d(ε, ô, ó, u, t, î, s, ç) = d2(u, t)
where d2(u, t) is a recursive function which gives a Borel code of

α : α
 lh(u)

= t
	
—
this is easy to get.
(3) If t = s & ô(u ∗⟨t, î, ç⟩) ̸= 1, then
d(ε, ô, ó, u, t, î, s, ç) = d0,
where d0 is a ﬁxed (recursive) Borel code of ∅.
(4) If t = s & ó(u ∗⟨t, î, ç⟩) ̸= 1, then
d(ε, ô, ó, u, t, î, s, ç) = d1
where d1 is a ﬁxed (recursive) Borel code of N.
It is clear that d is recursive on its domain, so let ˆd ∈N be recursive so that
d(ε, ô, ó, u, t, î, s, ç)↓
=⇒d(ε, ô, ó, u, t, î, s, ç) = { ˆd}(ε, ô, ó, u, t, î, s, ç)
= {S( ˆd, ε, ô, ó, u)}(t, î, s, ç)
and ﬁnally put
g(ε, ô, ó, u) = v
 S( ˆd, ε, ô, ó, u)

.
Obviously g is a total recursive function.
Now following our original plan for the proof, choose a recursive ε∗by the Recursion
Theorem so that
g(ε∗, ô, ó, u) = {ε∗}(ô, ó, u)
and let
u∗(ô, ó, u) = {ε∗}(ô, ó, u).
To prove that u∗has the required properties, suppose ô and ó code trees T and S so
that p[T] ∩p[S] = ∅, and let J be the tree of triples (with code j(ô, ó)) we associated

7B.4]
7B. The Suslin-Kleene Theorem
305
with T and S and which is now wellfounded. We check by bar recursion on j that
if u ∈J, then u∗(ô, ó, u) codes a Borel set Cu that separates p[Tf(u)] from p[Sh(u)] by
looking over the steps in the constructive proof of 2E.1 and verifying that (for the
ﬁxed T, S), d(ε, ô, ó, u, t, î, s, ç) codes the set Dt,î,s,ç and u∗(ô, ó, u) codes the set Cu.⊣

We customarily assume that the system {GX} is a good parametrization (in Σ1

7B.4. The Suslin-Kleene Theorem (Kleene(2)). For each product space X, there is
a recursive function v : N × N →N such that if α, â are Σ
e
1
1-codes of sets A, B ⊆X,
respectively and A ∩B = ∅, then v(α, â) is a Borel code of some set C which separates
A from B, i.e.,
A ⊆C,
C ∩B = ∅.
In particular, for each X, there is a recursive function v∗: N →N such that if α is a
∆
e
1
1-code of A ⊆X, then v∗(α) is a Borel code of A.
Proof. Take ﬁrst X = N, let G ⊆N × N be Σ1

by 4A.1(i) a recursive Q such that

⟨â(t), ã(t)⟩: t ∈ù & ¬Q

is clearly a tree and in fact
Gα = p[T (α)];
moreover (easily) there is a recursive function u1 such that for each α, è1(α) is a code
of T (α). Letting u : N × N →N be the recursive function of 7B.3, we can then take
for the space N,
v(α, â) = u

If X is any product space, let

There is a simple converse to the Suslin-Kleene Theorem.
7B.5. Theorem. Assume that we code the ∆

We will deﬁne the function u by the Recursion Theorem, so that
u(α) = g(ε∗, α)
where g will be a (total) recursive function and ε∗will be recursive and chosen so that
g(ε∗, α) = {ε∗}(α).
(∗)
After that we will prove by induction on î that, if α ∈BCî and codes the set A ⊆X,
then u(α) is a ∆
e
1
1-code for A.
In deﬁning g(ε, α) it is convenient to talk of the “basis,” the “induction step” and
the “induction hypothesis” that {ε}(â) “must satisfy” when â ∈S
ç<î BCç, as if we
were giving an ordinary deﬁnition by transﬁnite recursion and we already knew that
g(ε, α) = {ε}(α) and α ∈BCî for some î. Of course the deﬁnition must make sense
for arbitrary ε, α and g must be recursive; but after g is deﬁned and ε is ﬁxed to be
some ε∗satisfying (∗) above, then these informal comments in the deﬁnition of g lead
easily to a proof that u(α) = {ε∗}(α) has the required properties.
Basis. If α(0) = 0, set

We may assume here that {α⋆}(i) is deﬁned for each i and is a Borel code of some Ai
so that α is the code of
A = S

x ∈A ⇐⇒¬P1(ε, α, x) ⇐⇒¬G

so that we can set in this case
g(ε, α) = ⟨S(ε1, ε, α), S(ε0, ε, α)⟩.
(2)
The deﬁnition of g is now complete by the equations (1) and (2) which do not depend
on the discussion (this is important) and determine g as a total recursive function. We
ﬁx ε = ε∗so that (∗) above holds and we take u(α) = {ε∗}(α); for this ε∗, the
discussion in the deﬁnition of g translates easily into a rigorous proof by induction on
î that, if α ∈BCî and codes A, then u(α) is a ∆
e
1
1-code of A.
⊣
Since all recursive functions are continuous, the Suslin-Kleene Theorem and its
converse imply weak, “classical” versions where the uniformities v, u are only claimed
to be continuous. These results are of obvious interest to the classical theory, but their
proof seems to need the Recursion Theorem.
In addition to these results, there are many more powerful applications of Kleene’s
method of deﬁnition by eﬀective transﬁnite recursion. Complete proofs by this method
seem a bit technical and hard to read in the beginning. However, once one understands
the key idea, one can skip most of the technicalities and focus on the key points of
these arguments—which is that certain assertions hold uniformly in the codings in the
sense of 3H.

7. The recursion theorem
[7B.7
The hyperarithmetical sets have a direct characterization which is natural in the
eﬀective theory as an analog of the Borel sets.
To establish this, we will use the
machinery of (Σ0
1-) recursive partial functions coded in ù that we established in 7B.6,
i.e., {e}(x) below is {e}X,Y
Γ
with Γ = Σ0
1.
Recall from 3H that a coding of a set S is any mapping
ð : D ։ S
onto S. We say that the coding is in ù if the set of codes D is a subset of ù.
Suppose S is a collection of subsets of a space X. We say that S is an eﬀective ó-ﬁeld
if there is a coding ð : D ։ S for S in ù such that the following properties hold.
(1) Each nbhd in X is uniformly in S: i.e., for some recursive u1 : ù →ù, u1(s) is
a code of N(X, s) (i.e., ð
 u1(s)

= Ns).
(2) S is uniformly closed under complementation; i.e., there is a recursive u2 : ù →ù
such that if ð(a) = A ∈S, then ð
 u2(a)

= X \ A.
(3) S is uniformly closed under recursive unions in the following sense: there is a
recursive function u3 : ù →ù such that if {e}(i) is deﬁned for each i ∈ù and gives a
code in S of some Ai ⊆X, then u3(e) gives a code in S of S
i Ai.
The last condition is one natural way of insuring that from each recursive description
of a sequence of sets in S we can eﬀectively ﬁnd a code of the union of the sequence.
7B.7 (Kleene [1955c](2)). Prove that for each space X, the collection ∆1

S as above with recursive uniformities u1, u2, u3. Using the Recursion Theorem for
recursive functions coded in ù (7A.6) prove the following result: there is a recursive
function v : ù →ù such that whenever {a}(i) is deﬁned for every i (with values in
ù) and the resulting irrational {a} is a Borel code of some set A ⊆X, then v(a) is a
code in S of A. (The construction is a bit messy but direct.) Now use 7B.6.
⊣
We have introduced two diﬀerent codings for Borel sets and the question arises if
the results we have obtained (which refer explicitly to the codings) depend on the
particular coding we used. The answer is: not essentially.
Suppose ð : Dð ։ S, ñ : Dñ ։ S are two codings of the same set S in the sense
of 3H, where Dð ⊆X and Dñ ⊆Y. We will say that ð and ñ are (recursively) equivalent
if there exist partial functions f : X ⇀Y, g : Y ⇀X which are (Σ0
1-) recursive on
Dð and Dñ respectively so that Diagram 7B.1 commutes; thus f(x) gives a code in ñ
of the object coded by x in ð and g(y) gives a code in ð of the object coded by y in ñ.
It is clear that theorems which assert the existence of Γ-recursive uniformities (Γ
a Σ∗-pointclass) for a given coding ð are automatically for an equivalent coding ñ.
The technical advantage of the coding for Borel sets that we used in this section is
that we can get total recursive uniformities for it, whereas for the the coding of 3H the
uniformities are often partial; but the codings are equivalent.

7B.8. Prove that the coding of Borel sets introduced in 3H is recursively equivalent
to the coding introduced in this section.
Hint. For both directions the Recursion Theorem is used. Let us consider brieﬂy
the direction in which partial functions are introduced.
We want to deﬁne u by
u(α) = g(ε∗, α),
where g will be partial, recursive on its domain and ε∗will be recursive, chosen so that
g(ε∗, α)↓=⇒[g(ε∗, α) = {ε∗}(α)];
moreover, if α ∈BCî is a Borel code of A, then u(α) will be a Borel code in the sense
of 3H (say 3H-Borel code for sort) of the same set A.
(1) If α(0) = 0, deﬁne g(ε, α) trivially to give a 3H-Borel code for Nα(1).
(2) If α(0) = 1, then we may assume that {α⋆}(i) is deﬁned for each i and codes
some Ai, so by the induction hypothesis, {ε}
 {α⋆}(i)

gives a 3H-Borel code of Ai;
deﬁne then g(ε, α) so that whenever for each i, {ε}
 {α⋆}(i)

↓, then g(ε, α) = â for
some â such that
â(0) = 1,
(â⋆)i = {ε}
 {α⋆}(i)

(i ∈ù).
It is quite easy to do this and have g recursive on its domain.
If we now get u from g as above, we have no problem showing (by induction on î)
that for α ∈BCî, u(α) is deﬁned and gives the right thing. But it is not possible to get
a total recursive function g with the properties we need.
⊣
We will end these exercises with a simple but interesting application of the Suslin-
Kleene Theorem—there are many others of this type.

7C. Inductive deﬁnability
We will survey here brieﬂy the theory of inductive deﬁnability of relations which is
intimately connected with some of our concerns. One of our aims is to get a new
and interesting characterization of Π1
1; we will also prove a theorem of Solovay about
the pointclass
G
Σ0
2 of 6D which relates games with inductive deﬁnability and we will
introduce the pointclass of inductive sets, a natural extension of the pointclass of
projective sets.

7. The recursion theorem
[7C.1
Suppose
Φ : Power(X) →Power(X)
is a pointset operation which takes subsets of X into subsets of X and suppose further
that Φ is monotone, i.e.,
A ⊆B =⇒Φ(A) ⊆Φ(B).
For each ordinal î we deﬁne the î’th iterate Φî of Φ by the transﬁnite recursion
Φî = Φ(S
ç<î Φç)
and we call
Φ∞= S
î Φî
the ﬁxed point of Φ or the set built up by Φ.
7C.1. Lemma. Let Φ be a monotone operator on Power(X).
(i) If æ ≤î, then Φæ ⊆Φî.
(ii) There is a an ordinal κ, such that there exists a surjection f : X ։ κ, and
Φ∞= Φκ = S
î<κ Φî.
(iii) The set Φ∞built up by Φ is the least ﬁxed point of Φ, i.e.,
Φ(Φ∞) = Φ∞,
Φ∞= T{A ⊆X : Φ(A) ⊆A}.
Proof. (i) is immediate by monotonicity,
Φæ = Φ(S
ç<æ Φç) ⊆Φ(S
ç<î Φç) = Φî.
To prove (ii), notice that if for each ordinal î we had
S
ç<î Φç ⫋Φî,
then the operation î 7→(Φî\S
ç<î Φç)would injectthe class ofordinals into Power(X),
which is absurd; so there is a least κ for which Φ∞= Φκ = S
î<κ Φî, and the map
x 7→the least î such that x ∈Φî
takes Φκ onto κ.
This argument also proves that Φ∞is a ﬁxed point of Φ, since (choosing κ as in (ii))
we have
Φ(Φ∞) = Φ(Φκ) = Φ(S
î<κ Φî) = Φκ = Φ∞.
On the other hand, if Φ(A) ⊆A, then an easy induction shows that for each î, Φî ⊆A
(using monotonicity), so that Φ∞⊆A.
⊣
The least ordinal κ which satisﬁes (ii) in this lemma is called the closure ordinal of
Φ—it gives us the length of the recursion determined by the operation Φ. (Notice that
if X is equinumerous with an ordinal, then the cardinality of κ is ≤card(X)—but it
is useful to have this version of the Lemma which does not depend on the Axiom of
Choice.)
In order to study the more useful deﬁnitions by recursion with parameters, it is
convenient to switch from set operations to set relations, i.e., relations with arguments
both points and pointsets. We will denote a typical set relation by
ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, A1, . . . , Ak),

7C.1]
7C. Inductive deﬁnability
311
where x1, . . . , xn vary over speciﬁed spaces X1, . . . , Xn and A1, . . . , Ak vary over the
subsets of speciﬁed spaces Y1, . . . , Yk respectively. (Of course, we may have n = 0 or
k = 0, so in particular, all pointsets are set relations.)
We call ϕ monotone if
ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, A1, . . . , Ak) & A1 ⊆B1 & · · · & Ak ⊆Bk
=⇒ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, B1, . . . , Bk).
A set relation is operative on the space W if it is monotone and of the form
ϕ(w, x, A)
where w varies over W and A varies over the subsets of W. Such a relation determines
naturally for each x ∈X a monotone set operation on the subsets of W,
Φx(A) = {w : ϕ(w, x, A)}
which we can iterate and set
ϕî(w, x) ⇐⇒w ∈Φî
x;
it is clear that each relation ϕî is deﬁned directly by the recursion
ϕî(w, x) ⇐⇒ϕ
 w, x, {w′ : (∃ç < î)ϕç(w′, x)}

.
To simplify this further, put
ϕ<î(w, x) ⇐⇒(∃ç < î)ϕç(w, x)
(1)
so that the determining equivalence for ϕî becomes
ϕî(w, x) ⇐⇒ϕ
 w, x, {w′ : ϕ<î(w′, x)}

.
(2)
We also put
ϕ∞(w, x) ⇐⇒(∃î)ϕî(w, x)
and we call ϕ∞the ﬁxed point of ϕ or the relation built up by ϕ.
The closure ordinal of ϕ is the least κ such that for all w ∈W, x ∈X
ϕ∞(w, x) ⇐⇒ϕκ(w, x) ⇐⇒ϕ<κ(w, x);
this is easily the supremum of the closure ordinals of all the set operations Φx(x ∈X)
associated with ϕ.
To illustrate the notions, let us reconsider from this point of view the analysis of Π1
1
relations that we gave in 4C in order to prove that Π1
1 is contained in every Spector
pointclass.
Suppose that Q ⊆X × ù is given and we put
P(x, w) ⇐⇒(∀α)(∃t)Q
 x, w ∗α(t)

.
(3)
Deﬁne the set relation ϕ(w, x, A) (with w ranging over ù and A ranging over subsets
of ù) by
ϕ(w, x, A) ⇐⇒Q(x, w) ∨(∀s)A(w ∗⟨s⟩);
(4)
now ϕ is clearly operative on ù and by (1) and (2) above,
ϕî(w, x) ⇐⇒ϕ
 w, x, {w′ : ϕ<î(w′, x)}

⇐⇒Q(x, w) ∨(∀s)ϕ<î(w ∗⟨s⟩, x).

312
7. The recursion theorem
[7C.1
In the notation that we used in the beginning of 4C then, clearly
ϕî(w, x) ⇐⇒Pî(x, w)
and hence by the argument given there,
P(x, w) ⇐⇒(∃î)Pî(x, w)
⇐⇒(∃î)ϕî(w, x)
⇐⇒ϕ∞(w, x),
i.e., except for the order of the variables, P is the ﬁxed point of ϕ. Using the canonical
representation of Π1
1 sets (4A.1) and setting w = 1 in (3), we thus have that every Π1
1
pointset R ⊆X satisﬁes
R(x) ⇐⇒ϕ∞(1, x),
where ϕ∞is the ﬁxed point of a set relation deﬁned by (4) above with Q some Σ0
1 set; in
fact if X is of type 0 or 1, we can take Q to be recursive.
In order to deﬁne a relation R on X here, we perform for each x an induction on ù
and we ask at the end whether the speciﬁc constant 1 belongs to the ﬁxed point of this
induction; this key example motivates the following basic deﬁnition.
Suppose Γ is a collection of monotone set relation and R ⊆X; we say that R is
Γ-inductive on W if there is a set relation ϕ(w, x, A) in Γ which is operative on W and
some point w0 ∈W, such that
R(x) ⇐⇒ϕ∞(w0, x).
(5)
If we can choose a recursive w0 in (5), we call R absolutely Γ-inductive on W.
Let us now look at some speciﬁc examples of collections of set relations and (in
particular) try to ﬁnd a simple Γ so that Π1
1 consists precisely of all pointsets that
are Γ-inductive on ù. We will extend to (some) set relations the Kleene hierarchy of
arithmetical and analytical pointclasses.
A collection Γ of set relations is a monotone Σ-collection if the following conditions
hold.
(i) All set relations in Γ are monotone.
(ii) For each space W, Γ contains the relation of evaluation on W,
EW(w, A) ⇐⇒A(w)
(A ⊆W);
(6)
this is obviously monotone.
(iii) Γ contains all the Σ0
1 pointsets (viewed as set relations with no set arguments)
and it is closed under & , ∨, ∃≤, ∀≤, ∃ù and trivial substitutions; by trivial substitution
here we mean any map of the form
(x1, . . . , xn, A1, . . . , Ak) 7→(xj1, . . . , xjs, Al1, . . . , Alt)
where for each i, 1 ≤ji ≤n and 1 ≤li ≤k, so that we can add, permute or identify
variables of any sort and stay in Γ.
A monotone Π-collection is deﬁned in the same way, except that we replace the
conditions Σ0
1 ⊆Γ and closure under ∃ù by Π0
1 ⊆Γ and closure under ∀ù.

Diagram 7C.1. The positive arithmetical collections of set relations.
The collection posΣ0

and posΠ0
1 is the smallest monotone Π-collection. Proceeding inductively, put
posΠ0

etc.
It is trivial to check that the canonical diagram of inclusions holds for these collec-
tions, see Diagram 7C.1, where of course
pos∆0
n = posΣ0
n ∩posΠ0
n.
Most of the other formal properties of the arithmetical pointsets also extend trivially
to these positive arithmetical set relations with one obvious exception: the negation of
the basic relation EW in (6) is not positive arithmetical, so that this collection of set
relations is not closed under ¬.
The extension of these deﬁnitions to the positive analytical set relations is immediate,
posΣ1
1 = ∃N (S
n posΠ0
n),
posΠ1
1 = ∀N (S
n posΣ0
n),
and inductively,
posΣ1
n+1 = ∃N (posΠ1
n),
posΠ1
n+1 = ∀N (posΣ1
n).
Again the diagram of inclusions is easy to establish.
We now have all notions we need to state the characterization of Π1
1 in terms of
inductive deﬁnability on ù.
7C.2. Theorem. (i) All the positive analytical set relations are monotone.
(ii) Every Π1
1 pointset R is positive ∆0
2-inductive on ù; in fact, if R is of type 0 or 1,
then R is positive Π0
1-inductive on ù (Kleene(3)).
(iii) If R is positive Π1
n-inductive on ù, then R is Π1
n (Spector [1961]).
(iv) If R is positive Σ1
n-inductive on ù and n ≥2, then R is Σ1
n (Spector [1961]).
Proof. (i) holds for posΣ0
1 and posΠ0
1 because the collection of monotone set
relations is easily both a Σ-collection and a Π-collection and it contains E. For the
higher collections use induction.

314
7. The recursion theorem
[7C.2
(ii) was proved above, since the set relation deﬁned by (4) is trivially in pos∆0
2,
ϕ(w, x, A) ⇐⇒Q(x, w) ∨(∀s)(∀u)[u ̸= w ∗⟨s⟩∨A(u)].
With each set relation ϕ(x, A) where A varies over subsets of ù we associate the
pointset Qϕ ⊆X × N,
Qϕ(x, α) ⇐⇒ϕ
 x, {t : α(t) = 1}

;
it is trivial to check that if ϕ is posΣ1
n or posΠ1
n, then Qϕ is Σ1
n or Π1
n respectively.
To prove (iii) we use the characterization of Φ∞in 7C.1(iii), as the least ﬁxed point
of Φ: if ϕ(w, x, A) is operative on ù, tracing the deﬁnitions,
ϕ∞(w, x) ⇐⇒w ∈Φ∞
x
⇐⇒(∀A){Φx(A) ⊆A =⇒w ∈A}
⇐⇒(∀A){(∀w′)[ϕ(w′, x, A) =⇒w′ ∈A] =⇒w ∈A}
⇐⇒(∀A){(∃w′)[ϕ(w′, x, A) & w′ /∈A] ∨w ∈A}
⇐⇒(∀α){(∃w′)[Qϕ(w′, x, α) & α(w′) ̸= 1] ∨α(w) = 1},
so that if ϕ is posΠ1
n, then Qϕ is Π1
n and hence ϕ∞is Π1
n.
To prove (iv) we analyze the deﬁnition of Φî by transﬁnite recursion. Check ﬁrst,
using monotonicity that
ϕ∞(w, x) ⇐⇒w ∈Φ∞
x
⇐⇒there exists a sequence of sets {Aî}î<κ indexed
by some countable ordinal κ such that
(∀î < κ)[Aî ⊆Φx(S
ç<î Aç)] & w ∈S
î<κ Aî.
Using the canonical codes for ordinals and associating with each irrational α the set
{w : α(w) = 1}, we then have
ϕ∞(w, x) ⇐⇒(∃â)(∃α)

â ∈WO
& (∀n)

n ≤â n =⇒{w′ : (α)n(w′) = 1}
⊆Φx
 ∪{w′ : (∃m <â n)[(α)m(w′) = 1]}

& (∃n)

n ≤â n & (α)n(w) = 1
	
.
Now using monotonicity again,
w′′ ∈Φx
 ∪{w′ : (∃m <â n)[(α)m(w′) = 1]}

⇐⇒(∃ã)
h
(∀w′)

ã(w′) = 1 =⇒(∃m <â n)[(α)m(w′) = 1]

& Qϕ(w′′, x, ã)
i
;
thus if ϕ is posΣ1
n, this last relation is Σ1
n and then easily ϕ∞is also Σ1
n, provided of
course that n ≥2 so that the Π1
1 relation “â ∈WO” is Σ1
n.
⊣
This simple result does not handle the case of positive Σ1
1-induction on ù—we will
deal with this very interesting example in 7C.10.
Let us now turn to induction on N which is more directly relevant to descriptive set
theory.

7C.5]
7C. Inductive deﬁnability
315
A pointset R ⊆X is inductive if it is positive analytical inductive on N, i.e., if there
is a set relation ϕ(α, x, A) which is in some posΣ1
n and operative on N and some ﬁxed
α0 ∈N so that
R(x) ⇐⇒ϕ∞(α0, x).
(7)
We call R hyperprojective if both R and ¬R are inductive and we denote the pointclasses
of inductive and hyperprojective pointsets respectively by IND and HYP.
If (7) holds with a recursive irrational α0, then R is absolutely inductive and if both
R and ¬R are absolutely inductive, then R is absolutely hyperprojective. We will denote
these two “lightface” pointclasses by IND and HYP respectively.(4)
The deﬁnition of inductive sets together with the characterization of Π1
1 sets in 7C.2
suggest that IND is somehow a “generalization” or “second-order analog” of the
pointclass Π1
1. In fact (with suitable hypotheses) almost the entire theory of Π1
1 can
be extended to IND. We will look at some of these results in the exercises, but it is
worth putting down here the statements of three basic facts.
7C.3. Theorem (Moschovakis). The class IND of all absolutely inductive sets is a
Spector pointclass, in fact it is the smallest Spector pointclass which is closed under both
∀N and ∃N ; its associated boldface class is IND, i.e., a set R ⊆X is inductive if and
only if there is some absolutely inductive R∗⊆N × X and some ε ∈N so that
R = R∗
ε = {x : R∗(ε, x)}.
Proof. See 7C.12–7C.15.
⊣
7C.4. Theorem (AC, Moschovakis [1971b]). A pointset R ⊆X is absolutely induc-
tive if and only if there is an analytical (or even Σ1
1) pointset P such that
R(x) ⇐⇒{(∃α0)(∀α1)(∃α2)(∀α3) · · · }(∃n)P(x, ⟨α0, . . . , αn−1⟩).
Proof. See 7C.18.
⊣
The interpretation of the inﬁnite string of quantiﬁers here is via games, as in 6D,
except that now the games are played in N. This representation of IND is obviously
analogous to the representation of Π1
1 as
G
Σ0
1 in 6D in terms of open games on ù.
7C.5. Theorem (Moschovakis [1978]). If every hyperprojective set is determined,
then every absolutely inductive set admits an IND-scale.
In particular, every absolutely inductive R ⊆X × Y can be uniformized by some
absolutely inductive R∗⊆R and every non-empty absolutely inductive pointset has an
absolutely hyperprojective member.
Proof. See 7C.19.
⊣
The collection of inductive sets was the largest pointclass on which deﬁnable scales
were known to exist from any hypotheses, when this book was ﬁrst published, and
whether coinductive sets admit deﬁnable scales appeared to be a critical open problem.
It was quickly solved, however, and the solution led to a beautiful characterization of
the class of scaled pointsets in the universe L(R)(9).
Exercises
Let us start with a simple result which relates these new positive analytical set
relations with the Kleene pointclasses.

conversely, for each α ∈N and ﬁxed k, let
Pα(t1, . . . , tk) ⇐⇒α(⟨t1, . . . , tk⟩) = 1,
so that
PαP = P.
Finally, if ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, A1, . . . , Am) is a set relation where each Ai varies over the
subsets of some space Xi of type 0, put
Qϕ(x1, . . . , xn, α1, . . . , αm) ⇐⇒ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, Pα1, . . . , Pαm).
7C.6. (i) Prove that if ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, A1, . . . , Am) is in posΣ0
k or posΠ0
k, then the
associated pointset Qϕ is in Σ0
k or Π0
k respectively.
(ii) Prove that if each Ai ranges over the subsets of some space Yi of type 0, then
ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, A1, . . . , Am) is in posΣ1
k or posΠ1
k if and only if ϕ is monotone and the
associated Qϕ is in the corresponding pointclass Σ1
k or Π1
k.
Hint. (i) and half of (ii) can be veriﬁed by a simple induction on the deﬁnition of
the positive analytical classes of set relations. For the other direction of (ii) notice (for
example) that if ϕ(x, A) is monotone and A varies over subsets of ù, then
ϕ(x, A) ⇐⇒(∃â){(∀t)[â(t) = 1 =⇒A(t)] & Qϕ(x, â)}
⇐⇒(∀â){(∀t)[A(t) =⇒â(t) = 1] =⇒Qϕ(x, â)},
from which it follows immediately that if Qϕ is in Σ1
k or Π1
k, then ϕ is in posΣ1
k or
posΠ1
k.
⊣
The next result clariﬁes the connection between the Kleene Basis Theorem for
Σ1
1 (4E.8) and the Martin-Solovay Basis Theorem for Σ1
2n+1 (6C.10, 6C.11).
7C.7. (i) Prove that every Σ1
1 pointset of type 0 is recursive in some Σ1
1 set P ⊆ùk
such that αP is a Π1
1-singleton.
(ii) Prove that if P is Σ1
1 of type 0 and α is any Π1
1-singleton which is not ∆1
1, then
αP ∈∆1
1(α).
Thus in the notation of 6C.11, the Kleene Basis Theorem asserts that there is a
Σ1
1 set P of type 0 such that {x : x ∈∆1
1(αP)} is a basis for Σ1
1 and such that αP is
≤1-minimal among the non-∆1
1 singletons in Π1
1.
Hint. Let G ⊆X be any Π1
1 set of type 0, choose ϕ(w, x, A) in posΠ0
1 by 7C.2 so
that for suitable integers w∗,
G(x) ⇐⇒ϕ∞(w∗, x)
and let
H(w, x) ⇐⇒ϕ∞(w, x).

so that αH is a Π1
1-singleton. This establishes (i) by considering the complements of
G and H.

1 and choose n0, n1 so that
¬P(s) ⇐⇒G(n0, s, â)
(any â),

(∀s)[¬P(s) =⇒ϕ(n0, s, α) ≤ϕ(n1, s, α)],
otherwise, easily, α is a Σ1

1; this then yields immediately that P

⊣
Before going into the discussion of speciﬁc pointclasses introduced by inductive
deﬁnitions, it is worth putting down a soft and very general—but useful—remark
about inductive deﬁnability.
Suppose Γ is a pointclass and ϕ(x, A) is a set relation where A ranges over the
subsets of some W; we say that ϕ is Γ on Γ if for every Q ⊆Z × W in Γ, the relation
P(x, z) ⇐⇒ϕ
 x, {w : Q(z, w)}

is also in Γ. The deﬁnition extends in the obvious way to more general set relations
ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, A1, . . . , Am).
7C.8 (Moschovakis [1974b]). Suppose Γ is adequate, ù-parametrized and normed
and suppose that ϕ(w, x, A) is Γ on Γ and operative on W; prove that the ﬁxed point
ϕ∞(w, x) is in Γ.
Hint. Choose good parametrizations of Γ by 3H.4, let ø be a Γ-norm on a universal
set G ⊆ù × W × Z, and put
Q(m, w, x) ⇐⇒ϕ
 w, x, {w′ : (m, w′, x) <∗
ø (m, w, x)}

;
Q is easily in Γ, so by 3H.4 there is a ﬁxed m∗∈ù so that
Q(m∗, w, x) ⇐⇒G(m∗, w, x)
⇐⇒ϕ
 w, x, {w′ : (m∗, w′, x) <∗
ø (m∗, w, x)}


Now check by induction on ø(m∗, w, x) that
G(m∗, w, x) =⇒ϕ∞(w, x)
and by induction on î that
ϕî(w, x) =⇒G(m∗, w, x),
so that
ϕ∞(w, x) ⇐⇒G(m∗, w, x).
(Both argument appeal to the monotonicity of ϕ.)

Together with the Third Periodicity Theorem 6E.1, the last exercise implies that if
player I can win a Σ0

Σ1
1-inductive on ù. Thomas John has recently computed the complexity of winning
strategies for Σ0
3 games (in terms of recursion of higher types) but the corresponding
problem for Σ0
n (n ≥4) is still open.
Let us now turn to an outline of the proofs of 7C.3–7C.5 ; it will be convenient
to frame some of the lemmas in a context wider than positive analytical induction,
although the proofs will make it clear that we have not aimed at the most general
results.
A collection Γ of set relations is (temporarily) called “suitable for our purposes”
if Γ is both a Σ-collection and a Π-collection (as we deﬁned these preceding 7C.2),
and if in addition Γ is closed under recursive substitution in the following sense: if
P(z, A1, . . . , Ak) is in Γ and f(x), g1(x, y1), . . . , gk(x, yk) are recursive functions, then
Q(x, B1, . . . , Bk) is also in Γ, where

.
It is not hard to verify that the collections posΣ1
n, posΠ1
n are all suitable for our
purposes.
For any Γ, put
IND(Γ; N) = all relations Γ-inductive on N,
IND(Γ; N) = all relations absolutely Γ-inductive on N.
7C.11. Suppose that Γ is suitable for our purposes and
ϕ1(y1, A1, . . . , An), ϕ2(y2, A1, . . . , An), . . . , ϕn(yn, A1, . . . , An)
are in Γ, where each yi ranges over the space Yi of type 1 and each Ai ranges over the
subsets of Yi. Deﬁne the sets J î
i ⊆Yi by the simultaneous induction:
y1 ∈J î
1 ⇐⇒ϕ1(y1, J <î
1 , J <î

then each J ∞

is absolutely Γ-inductive on N. In this case we allow that for some i we
may have Yi = ∅, i.e., ϕ1(x, A1, . . . , An) is given and

In particular, if ϕ(y, x, A) is in Γ and operative on the space Y, then the ﬁxed point
ϕ∞(y, x) is absolutely Γ-inductive on N.
Hint. Take n = 2 without parameters, so that ϕ1(y1, A1, A2), ϕ2(y2, A1, A2) are
given, let

7C.12. Prove that if Γ is suitable for our purposes, then IND(Γ; N) contains all the
pointsets in Γ and is closed under & , ∨, ∃ù, ∀ù and recursive substitutions; if Γ is
also closed under either ∃N or ∀N , then so is IND(Γ; N).
Hint. To show closure under ∃N as an example, suppose
R(x, â) ⇐⇒ϕ∞(α0, x, â)
with α0 recursive and ϕ(α, x, â, A) in Γ and operative on N and consider the system
ϕ1(α, â, x, A1, A2) ⇐⇒ϕ(α, x, â, {α′ : A1(α′, â)}),

where ø is in posΠ1

ϕ1(α, â, x, A1, A2) ⇐⇒ø(α, x, â, A2)
ϕ2(α, x, A1, A2) ⇐⇒(∃â)A1(α, â).
Check easily (using monotonicity) that
ϕ∞(α, x) ⇐⇒J ∞
2 (α, x);
now if α0 is recursive, then the relation {x : ϕ∞(α0, x)} which is a typical member
of IND(posΣ1

recursive substitution.

Hint. If ϕ(α, x, A) is positive analytical with A ⊆N, we have an obvious norm on

ó(α, x) = least î such that ϕî(α, x);
we will prove that this norm is inductive, so that for any recursive α0, the induced
norm

7C.16. Prove 7C.3.
Hint. From 7C.12–7C.15, we know that IND is a Spector pointclass with all the
right closure properties and the fact that IND is its associated boldface class follows
from closure of IND under the substitution of constants which is elementary.
Suppose now that Γ is any Spector pointclass which is closed under both ∃N and
∀N ; then easily, each positive analytical ϕ(α, x, A) is Γ on Γ, so that by 7C.8, ϕ∞∈Γ
and hence IND ⊆Γ.

Hint. Start with
ϕ(x, A) ⇐⇒(∃α)(∀â)ø(x, α, â, A)
where ø is in posΣ1

ø(x, α, â, A) ⇐⇒(∃ã)(∀ä)[Q2(x, α, â, ã, ä) ∨A(ä)]
from which the required representation follows immediately.
⊣
7C.18. Prove 7C.4.
Hint. By 7C.13, if R(x) is absolutely inductive, then
R(x) ⇐⇒ϕ∞(α0, x)
with ϕ(α, x, A)in posΣ1
3 and α0 recursive and by 7C.17 there is a Σ1
1 pointsetQ(α, x, â, ã, ä, ε)
so that for A ⫋N,
ϕ(α, x, A) ⇐⇒(∃â)(∀ã)(∃ä)(∀ε)[Q(α, x, â, ã, ä, ε) ∨A(ε)].
We claim that
ϕ∞(α, x) ⇐⇒{(∃â1)(∀ã1)(∃ä1)(∀ε1)(∃â2)(∀ã2)(∃ä2)(∀ε2) · · · }
[Q(α, x, â1, ã1, ä1, ε1) ∨Q(α, x, â2, ã2, ä2, ε2)

to check this, show by induction on î that ϕî(α, x) implies the right-hand-side and
show that if ¬ϕ∞(α, x), then II can easily win the game determining the truth of the
right-hand-side. Now half of 7C.4 follows immediately.
To prove the other half consider the inductive analysis of the open game on the right
hand side.

7C.19. Prove 7C.5.
Hint. It is enough to show (granting the hypotheses) that every ﬁxed point ϕ∞of
a positive analytical ϕ(α, x, A) admits an absolutely inductive scale. We will skip the
parameter x in outlining the argument.
There is an analytical scale ø0 = {ø0
n}n∈ù on ϕ0 = {α : ϕ(α, ∅)} by 6C.2 and the
Second Periodicity Theorem 6C.3, and from any hyperprojective scale ÷ë = {÷ë
n}n∈ù
on the iterate ϕ<ë = S
î<ë ϕî we can easily construct a scale øë on the iterate ϕë =
{α : ϕ(α, ϕ<ë)} by the same two theorems. On the other hand, given scales øî on ϕî
for each î < ë, deﬁne on ϕ<ë,
÷ë
0(α) = least î such that α ∈ϕî,
÷ë
n+1(α) = øî
n(α),
where î = ÷ë
0(α);
it is easy to check that ÷ë is a scale on ϕ<ë. Finally deﬁne ÷κ on ϕ∞= S
î<κ ϕî in the
same way, to get a scale on ϕ∞.
It remains to check that each ϕë and each ÷ë are hyperprojective in a “uniform”
way so that ÷κ is absolutely inductive—and in particular so that the hypotheses of
determinacy needed to go from ÷ë to øë actually hold.
Let G ⊆N × N be universal absolutely inductive, call ã = ⟨α, â⟩a code of the
hyperprojective set A ⊆N if A = {ä : G(α, ä)} = {ä : ¬G(â, ä)} and argue by
using 3H.2 that the pointclass HYP is uniformly closed under all operations in this
coding. Code also hyperprojective scales on sets in the obvious way.
Finally, use the Recursion Theorem 7A.2 to deﬁne a recursion function
f(α) = f∗(ε∗, α) = {ε∗}(α)
with the following property: for each α ∈ϕ∞, if ë = least î such that α ∈ϕî, then
f(α) is a code of the scale øë on ϕë as described above; there is a bit of checking to
be done, but the result follows easily from this.

7D. The completely playful universe
In the historical remarks at the end of Chapter 6 we mentioned the so-called Axiom
of Determinacy,
AD ⇐⇒every subset of N is determined,
introduced in Mycielski and Steinhaus [1962]. This is false by 6A.6, but the proof
of that result depended on a blatant application of the Axiom of Choice and none
has yet succeeded in violating AD without some appeal to choice. Thus it remains
possible that ADis consistent with the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ( without
choice) and one might attempt to study its consequences. We will derive a very few
of them in this section; the interested reader should go to the collections of papers
Kechris and Moschovakis [1978a], Kechris, Martin, and Moschovakis [1981], [1983],
Kechris, Martin, and Steel [1988] (and the further references given there) as well as
Kleinberg [1977] for a deeper study of this fascinating theory.
What is the value of proving theorems on the basis of a false assumption?
Mycielski and Steinhaus [1962] suggested that we might replace the Axiom of
Choice by AD in our thinking about sets, because it implies many desirable regularity
properties about sets of reals—under AD they are all Lebesgue measurable, they have

324
7. The recursion theorem
[7D.1
the property of Baire, etc. However, mathematicians with a realistic approach to set
theory resist this temptation to accept “desirable falsehoods” for the sake of utility or
simplicity. Moreover, many consequences of AD (proved since 1962) give a picture of
the universe of sets which is by no means “simple” and tends to contradict our basic
intuitions about sets at least as much as the alleged “undesirable” consequences of the
Axiom of Choice.
One might also study the consequences of AD in an attempt to prove it false without
using the Axiom of Choice. Some have worked on this worthy program but without
success so far.
Most mathematicians who work on AD are motivated by the hope that there is a
natural model of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (without AC) which contains all the
real numbers and in which AD holds, as suggested in Mycielski [1964]; by this we mean
that there is a collection M ⊇R of sets such that if we reinterpret “set” as “member
of M,” then all the classical axioms of set theory (except choice) become true and so
does the proposition AD. A natural candidate is the collection of sets
L(N) = the smallest model of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory which
contains N
which we will deﬁne precisely in Chapter 8. Consequences of AD then become true
assertions about L(N)—which in turn yield theorems about some of the sets in our
intended interpretation of set theory.(10)
There is also an obvious practical reason for learning to think in the context of
full determinacy: if you prove a result from AD, you can almost always rework the
argument to get a weaker theorem—or a reformulation—from restricted hypotheses
of deﬁnable determinacy such as we have been assuming.
Although AD is inconsistent with the full Axiom of Choice, it implies a very weak
Countable Principle of Choice for pointsets.
7D.1. Lemma. Assume AD and suppose P ⊆ù × X where X is any product space;
then
(∀n)(∃x)P(n, x) ⇐⇒(∃f : ù →X)(∀n)P
 n, f(n)

.
Proof. Let ð : N ։ X be a canonical surjection of N onto X and consider the
game where I plays n (his future moves being irrelevant) and II plays α; II wins if
P
 n, ð(α)

. Now I cannot win, since any strategy would ﬁx some n and then II can
beat it by playing some α so that P
 n, ð(α)

. By AD then, II has some winning
strategy ô and we can take
f(n) = ð([n] ∗ô).
⊣
The countable principle of choice is not strong enough and we will often assume
(together with AD) the following very reasonable proposition.
Axiom of Dependent Choices (DC). For every set of pairs P ⊆A × A from a
non-empty set A,
(∀x ∈A)(∃y ∈A)P(x, y) =⇒(∃f : ù →A)(∀n)P
 f(n), f(n + 1)

.
In eﬀect, DC says that we can make a countable number of choices, each choice
depending on the preceding choice. It is a very useful principle, for example it is the
only kind of choice we need to prove that a relation with no inﬁnite descending chains
must be wellfounded (i.e., every non-empty subset of its ﬁeld must have a minimal
member).

7D.3]
7D. The completely playful universe
325
The full Axiom of Choice implies DC easily and in Chapter 8 we will show that DC
holds in L(N), so that for our purposes, DC is an innocuous assumption. On the
other hand, Solovay [1978a] has shown (from strong hypotheses) that AD does not
formally imply DC.
It is very important to point out now that in this book we have not used any choice
principles other than DC without explicitly taking note of the fact. Actually there are
only a few results in whose proofs we used the full Axiom of Choice and we have listed
them all in an Appendix to this chapter, Section 7F.
Thus when we assume AD + DC, we can appeal to the whole theory developed so
far except for these few results. In the cases where we only assume AD and we used
previously proved theorems, the reader should be able to check easily that the proofs
of these theorems appeal at most to the Countable Principle of Choice for pointsets
which is a consequence of AD.
Let us put down for the record the regularity results already established in Chapter 6.
7D.2. Theorem. Assume AD; then every uncountable pointset has a non-empty per-
fect subset, every pointset has the property of Baire and for every ó-ﬁnite Borel measure
ì on a space X, every subset of X is ì-measurable (Davis [1964], Mycielski [1964],
Mycielski and Swierczkowski [1964], Mycielski [1966]).
Proof. Take Λ = power(N) in 6A.12, 6A.16 and 6A.18.
⊣
To look at a regularity result of a diﬀerent kind, consider the following relation
between pointsets A ⊆X and B ⊆Y:
A ≤w B ⇐⇒A is a continuous preimage of B
⇐⇒there is a continuous function f : X →Y such
that for all x, x ∈A ⇐⇒f(x) ∈B.
If A ≤w B, we say that A is Wadge reducible or continuously reducible to B. It is
obvious that ≤w is a transitive relation on the collection of all pointsets.
7D.3. Wadge’s Lemma (Wadge [1984]).
Assume AD and suppose A and B are
pointsets of type 1; then either A ≤w B or B ≤w ¬A = N \ A.
Proof. If A, B are sets of irrationals, let G(A, B) be the game where I plays α,
II plays â and II wins if the following equivalence holds:
α ∈A ⇐⇒â ∈B.
If II wins G(A, B) with a strategy ô, then
α ∈A ⇐⇒[α] ∗ô ∈B
and since the map α 7→[α] ∗ô is continuous, we have A ≤w B. If I wins G(A, B) with
a strategy ó, then

The result follows immediately for pointsets of type 1.

Wadge’s lemma says essentially that any two subsets of Baire space are comparable
in terms of the operations of continuous substitution and complementation. It has
many interesting consequences and we will come back to it in the exercises.
We now turn to one of the most fascinating problems in the theory of full determi-
nacy. How large is the continuum in a fully playful universe, a model of AD + DC?
From one point of view it is very small indeed.

7. The recursion theorem
[7D.4
7D.4. Theorem. If AD holds, then every pointset which can be wellordered is count-
able; in particular, N cannot be wellordered and if
ð : ë ֌ N
is any injection from an ordinal ë into N, then ë is countable.
Proof. If A is uncountable, then A has a perfect subset which (as a space with the
induced topology) is Borel isomorphic with N, so that any wellordering of A induces
a wellordering of ùù. If ñ : N ֌ Ordinals is the rank function of this wellordering,
then ñ−1(î) is a singleton for each î, so that 5A.10 applies and {(α, â) : α < â} does
not have the property of Baire, contradicting 7D.1.
⊣
Thus N is very small relative to the ordinals if we use injections to compare sizes.
When choice is not available, however, it is more natural to use surjections for this
purpose, and to think of an ordinal ë as not larger then N if we can map N onto ë.
Put
Θ = supremum{ë : there exists a surjection ð : N ։ ë};
AD implies that Θ is very large.
The key result is a coding lemma which asserts that bounded subsets of Θ and
functions on ordinals below Θ are “deﬁnable.”
Suppose < is a (strict) wellfounded relation on some S ⊆X and let
ñ : S ։ ë
be its rank function as in 2G deﬁned by the recursion
ñ(x) = supremum{ñ(y) + 1 : y < x}.
We can obviously think of each x ∈S as a code for the ordinal î = ñ(x).
Let
f : ën →Power(Y)
be a function which assigns subsets of Y to n-tuples from ë. A choice set for f (relative
to a given wellfounded relation < that codes ë) is any pointset
C ⊆X n × Y
such that
(x1, . . . , xn, y) ∈C =⇒x1, . . . , xn ∈S & y ∈f

7D.5. The Coding Lemma (I) (Moschovakis [1970]).(6) Assume AD, let < be a strict
wellfounded relation on some S ⊆X with rank function
ñ : S ։ ë,
and let Γ be any pointclass such that < ∈Γ, Σ1
1 ⊆Γ and Γ is ù-parametrized and closed
under & , ∨, ∃ù, ∀ù and ∃N . Then every function
f : ën →Power(Y)
has a choice set in the associated boldface pointclass Γ
e

Proof. For any unary function
f : ë →Power(Y)
and each î ≤ë, put
fî(ç) =
(
f(ç)
if ç < î,
∅
if î ≤ç.
We will prove the result for unary functions ﬁrst by assuming that some fî does not
have a choice set in Γ
e
and deducing a contradiction.
Suppose î < ë and Cî is a choice set for fî in Γ
e
. If f(î) = ∅, then Cî is obviously
a choice set for fî+1 also, while if y0 ∈f(î) and ñ(x0) = î, then
Cî+1 = Cî ∪{(x0, y0)}
is a choice set for fî+1 and it is also in Γ
e
. Thus the ordinal
κ = least î such that fî does not have a choice set in Γ
e
is a limit ordinal ≤ë.
Fix a good parametrization for Γ by 3H.1 and suppose G ⊆N × (X × Y) is
universal. As usually,
Gα = {(x, y) : G(α, x, y)}.
We consider the following two-person game: if I plays α and II plays â, then
II wins ⇐⇒Gα is not a choice set for any fî, î < κ
∨(∃î < κ)[Gα is a choice set for fî, and there is some ç > î
such thatGâ is a choice set for fç].
The game is determined by AD.
Case 1. I has a winning strategy ó. Now for each â there is some î(â) < κ such that
Gó∗[â] is a choice set for fî(â). Put
î = supremum{î(â) : â ∈N}
and check easily that the set
Cî = S
â Gó∗[â]
is a choice set for fî, so that by the choice of κ, î < κ; but since κ is limit, there is
then some ç > î, ç < κ and II can beat ó by playing any â so that Gâ is a choice set
for fç.
Case 2. II has a winning strategy ô. Let
{ε}(x) = U X,Y(ε, x)
be the partial function on X to N which is universal for all the partial functions on X
to N, (Σ
e
0
1-) recursive on their domain, and for each ε ∈N, w ∈X, put
(x, y) ∈Aε,w ⇐⇒(∃z)

z < w & {ε}(z) is deﬁned & G
 {ε}(z), x, y
	
;
each Aε,w is obviously in Γ
e
, and by 3H.2 there is a recursive function ð(ε, w) such that
Aε,w =

(x, y) : G
 ð(ε, w), x, y
	
.
Now the map
(ε, w) 7→[ð(ε, w)] ∗ô

328
7. The recursion theorem
[7D.6
is recursive in ô and total, so by the Recursion Theorem 7A.2, we can ﬁnd a ﬁxed
ε∗∈N such that for all w ∈X,
{ε∗}(w) = [ð(ε∗, w)] ∗ô;
to simplify notation, put
g(w) = {ε∗}(w).
Sublemma. For each w ∈S = Field(<), there is some ç = ç(w) > ñ(w), such that
Gg(w) is a choice set for fç(w).
Proof of the sublemma is by induction on ñ(w). If the sublemma holds for all
x < w, then Aε∗,w is clearly a choice set for fî with
î = supremum{ç(x) : x < w} ≥ñ(w)
and since g(w) = [ð(ε∗, w)] ∗ô is II’s response to I’s play ð(ε∗, w), it must be that
Gg(w) is a choice set for some fç with ç > î ≥ñ(w).
⊣(Sublemma)
It follows from this Sublemma that
supremum{ç(w) : w ∈S} = κ
and that
Cκ = S
w∈S Gg(w)
is a choice set for fκ in Γ
e
, contrary to the choice of κ.
This completes the proof of the Coding Lemma for unary functions. To prove it for
functions with any number of variables by induction, suppose
f : ën+1 →Power(Y)
is given and for ç < ë, put
fç(î1, . . . , în) = f(î1, . . . , în, ç)
and let
g(ç) = {α : Gα is a choice set for fç}.
Let Cg ⊆X × N be a choice set for g in Γ
e
and check that
C(x1, . . . , xn, x, y) ⇐⇒(∃α)[Cg(x, α) & G(α, x1, . . . , xn, y)]
is a choice set for f.

If ≤is a prewellordering with ﬁeld S ⊆X and

In applying the Coding Lemma, we often take Γ = posΣ1
1(Q1, . . . , Qn), where
posΣ1
1(Q1, . . . , Qn) = the smallest pointclass which contains
Q1, . . . , Qn and all Σ1

and which is closed under & , ∨, ∃ù, ∀ù and ∃N .
7D.7. Lemma. For any Q1, . . . , Qn, the pointclass posΣ1
1(Q1, . . . , Qn) is closed un-

7. The recursion theorem
[7D.8
7D.8. Theorem. Assume AD and let Γ be an ù-parametrized pointclass such that
Σ1
1 ⊆Γ and Γ is closed under & , ∨, ∃ù, ∀ù and ∃N . Let
ä
e
= supremum{| ≤| : ≤is a prewellordering of N in ∆
e
}
ã
e
= supremum{| ≺| : ≺is a strict wellfounded relation in Γ
e
with ﬁeld in N}.
(i) ä
e
is a cardinal.
(ii) ã
e
is a regular cardinal.
(iii) If Γ is also closed under ∀N , then ä
e
is a regular limit cardinal (i.e., weakly
inaccessible).
In particular, taking Γ = all inductive sets, the ordinal
ä
e
IND = supremum of all hyperprojective prewellorderings of N
is weakly inaccessible.(7,8)
Proof. (i) Assume towards a contradiction that for some ë < ä
e
we have a bijection
g : ë ֌
→ä
e
and let ≤be a prewellordering of some X in ∆
e
with rank function
ñ : X ։ ë.
The relation
P(î, ç) ⇐⇒g(î) ≤g(ç)
(î, ç < ë)
is wellfounded with length ä
e
and by the Coding Lemma 7D.6 it has its code set in ∆
e
;
but then ä
e
is the length of a ∆
e
prewellordering which is absurd.
(ii) Assume again towards a contradiction that some map
g : ë →ã
e
is coﬁnal with ã
e
, where ë < ã
e
and ë is the length of some strict wellfounded relation
≺in Γ
e
. Let G ⊆N × (N × N) be universal in Γ and put
f(î) = {α : Gα is wellfounded with ﬁeld in N and length g(î)};
by the Coding Lemma, choose a choice set C ∈Γ
e
for f and let
(x, α, â) ≺′ (x′, α′, â′) ⇐⇒x = x′ & α = α′ & C(x, α) & G(α, â, â′).
It is obvious that ≺′ is wellfounded in Γ
e
with length ã
e
, and this is easily absurd since
for each wellfounded relation in Γ
e
, we can ﬁnd a longer one.
(iii) If ≤is a prewellordering in ∆
e
, take Γ0 = posΣ1
1(≤, <) and notice by the closure
properties that Γ0 ⊆∆
e
. By (i), the ordinal ä
e
0 of Γ0 is a cardinal, and of course it is
bigger than the length of ≤and less than ä
e
; thus ä
e
is a limit cardinal.
To show that ä
e
is regular, suppose
g : ë →ä
e
is coﬁnal in ä
e
, where ë is the length of a ∆
e
-prewellordering ≤, and let G ⊆N ×(N ×N)
be universal in Γ. Put
f(î) = {(α, â) : Gα = N × N \ Gâ and Gα is a prewellordering
of N of length g(î)},

and let C be some choice set for f in posΣ1
1(<) ⊆∆
e
. For each (α, â) such that
Gα = N × N \ Gâ and Gα is a prewellordering of N, let
ñα,â(ã) = ñ(α, â, ã)
be the rank function mapping N onto some îα,â, and ﬁnally put
(x, α, â, ã) <∗(x′, α′, â′, ã′) ⇐⇒x < x′
∨(∃y)(∃y′)[x ∼y ∼x′ ∼y′
& C(y, α, â)
& C(y′, α′, â′)
& ñ(α, â, ã) ≤ñ(α′, â′, ã′)].
It is clear that <∗is a prewellordering of length ä
e
, so we will have the desired contra-
diction if we can show that <∗∈∆
e
.
The only clause in the deﬁnition of <∗which causes diﬃculty is the last one:
we must ﬁnd a ∆
e
relation P(α, â, ã, α′, â′, ã′) such that if Gα = N × N \ Gâ and
Gα′ = N × N \ Gâ′ are both prewellorderings in ∆
e
, then
ñ(α, â, ã) ≤ñ(α′, â′, ã′) ⇐⇒P(α, â, ã, α′, â′, ã′).
Now
ñ(α, â, ã) ≤ñ(α′, â′, ã′) ⇐⇒there is a set A ⊆îα,â × îα′,â′ which is
an order-preserving map of the initial
segment of Gα up to ã onto the initial
segment of Gα′ up to ã′;
by the Coding Lemma, for every such set A the pointset Code(A; Gα, Gâ) will be in ∆
e
,
i.e., it will be Gä and N × N \ Gε for some ä, ε. The proof is completed by verifying
easily that the conditions on Gä, Gε which guarantee that Gä = N × N \ Gε is the
code set of some similarity of initial segments translate to ∆conditions on ä, ε.

Kechris has recently veriﬁed that the least non-hyperprojective ordinal is Mahlo in
the context of AD, but long before that Solovay had already proved that there are
Mahlo cardinals below Θ. Moschovakis [1970] has some results of this type—as a
matter of fact, AD implies that Θ is quite immense.
The last theorem also has some obvious consequences about the ordinals ä

7. The recursion theorem
[7D.9
Proof. The second assertion follows immediately from the ﬁrst and 6C.12.
To prove the ﬁrst assertion by contradiction, let ë be the least ordinal such that for
some sequence of sets {Aî}î<ë, each Aî ⊆X is in ∆
e
but S
î<ë Aî /∈∆
e
. Clearly ë is
limit and there is a prewellordering ≤of N in ∆
e
with rank function
ñ : N ։ ë.
Let G ⊆N × X be universal in Γ and put
f(î) = {â : Aî = X \ Gâ};
if C ⊆N × N is a choice set for f in ¬Γ
e
by the Coding Lemma, then clearly
x ∈Añ(α) ⇐⇒(∃α′)(∃â)[α ∼α′ & C(α′, â) & ¬G(â, x)]
so that the relation
P(x, α) ⇐⇒x ∈Añ(α)
(1)
is in ¬Γ
e
.
By the choice of ë, for each æ < ë the unions
S
î<æ Aî,
S
î≤æ Aî
are in ∆
e
, so put
g1(æ) = {â : S
î<æ Aî = Gâ},
g2(æ) = {â : S
î≤æ Aî = Gâ},
take choice sets C1 and C2 for these two functions in ¬Γ
e
, and use them to show that
the following two relations are in ¬Γ
e
:
Q(x, α) ⇐⇒x /∈S
î<ñ(α) Aî,
(2)
R(x, α) ⇐⇒x ∈S
î≤ñ(α) Aî.
(3)
From the fact that P is in ¬Γ
e
, it follows immediately that the union A = S
î Aî is
in ¬Γ
e
. On this union we deﬁne the obvious norm:
ϕ(x) = ìî[x ∈Aî];
now
x ≤∗
ϕ y ⇐⇒(∃α)[P(x, α) & Q(y, α)],
x <∗
ϕ y ⇐⇒(∃α)[P(x, α) & R(y, α)],
so that ϕ is a ¬Γ
e
-norm.
What we have proved so far is that the union A = S
î<ë Aî is a set in ¬Γ
e
which admits
a ¬Γ
e
-norm. If A were also in Γ
e
, there would be nothing to prove; if not, then Wadge’s
Lemma 7D.3 implies immediately that every set B in ¬Γ
e
is a continuous preimage of
A (since A cannot be a continuous preimage of ¬B) and then easily, every set in ¬Γ
e
admits a ¬Γ
e
-norm. But this contradicts 4B.13—Γ
e
and ¬Γ
e
cannot both be normed. ⊣

consequences of AD—it is clear that we cannot hope for any neat characterization like
this for ∆

let C ⊆N × X be a choice set for f in Γ
e
and check that
x ∈S
î<ë Aî ⇐⇒(∃y)(∃α)[C(y, α) & C(α, x)].
To prove direction (⇐=) of the second assertion, suppose
x ∈A ⇐⇒(∃α)B(x, α)
with B in Π
e
1
n−1 and let B∗uniformize B by the Uniformization Theorem 6C.5. Now
by 4C.9, we have
(x, α) ∈B∗⇐⇒(∃î < ä

with suitable sets Cî ∈∆

1

x ∈A ⇐⇒(∃î < ä
e
1
n−1)(∃α)Cî(x, α)
and moreover, since each Cî ⊆B∗, we have
Cî(x, α) & Cî(x, â) =⇒α = â.
Thus taking
Dî = {x : (∃α)Cî(x, α)},
we know that Dî is the image of Cî under the recursive injection (x, α) 7→x, so that
by 4D.8, Dî ∈∆

e

n is a Spector
pointclass closed under ∀N and 4C.14 which then implies ó
e
1
n ≤ä
e
1
n.
(e) Each ä
e
1
n is a regular cardinal.
Proof. By 7D.8, each ó
e
1
n is a regular cardinal
and then (d) applies.
(f) For each odd n, there is a cardinal κn of coﬁnality ù such that
ä
e
1
n = (κn)+.
Proof. By 6C.11, each Σ
e
1
n set is ë-Suslin for some ë < ä
e
1
n, so take
κ = least ë such that some universal Σ
e
1
n set is ë-Suslin.
Nowκn is a cardinal by deﬁnition, the Kunen-Martin theorem implies tható
e
1
n ≤(κn)+,
and hence (since ó
e
1
n is also a cardinal) we have ó
e
1
n = (κn)+.
Suppose now that κn has coﬁnality > ù. By 2B.4 then, each Σ
e
1
n set A can be written
in the form
A = S
î<κn Aî
where each Aî is ë-Suslin for some ë < κn. Applying 2F.2 and using the fact that κn
is a cardinal so that ë+ ≤κn, each Aî is the union of κn sets which are κn-Borel, so
that by Martin’s Theorem 7D.9, each Aî is in ∆
e
1
n and then by 7D.9 again, A is in ∆
e
1
n.
This contradicts the hypothesis that A was an arbitrary set in Σ
e
1
n.
(g) For each odd n, ä
e
1
n−1 < κn < ä
e
1
n.
Proof. Assuming towards a contradiction
that ä
e
1
n−1 = ä
e
1
n, we get
(κn)+ = ä
e
1
n = ä
e
1
n−1 = (ä
e
1
n−2)+
so that κn = ä
e
1
n−2 which is absurd because ä
e
1
n−2 is regular while cf(κn) = ù. Thus
ä
e
1
n−1 < ä
e
1
n. But then ä
e
1
n−1 ≤κn and using again the regularity of ä
e
1
n−1, ä
e
1
n−1 < κn.⊣

Exercises
Recall the game G(A, B) that we associated with any two sets A, B ⊆N in the
proof of Wadge’s Lemma 7D.3: I plays α, II plays â and II wins if
α ∈A ⇐⇒â ∈B.
We say that A is Lipschitz reducible to B, A ≤l B if II wins G(A, B). Clearly,
A ≤l B =⇒A ≤w B
and by the proof of 7D.3, if AD holds then for each A, B, A ≤l B or B ≤l N \ A.
Put
A ∼l B ⇐⇒A ≤l B & B ≤l A,
A <l B ⇐⇒A ≤l B & A ̸∼l B;
and similarly with ≤w, <w, ∼w in place of ≤l, <l, ∼l; we deﬁne the Wadge degree and
the Lipschitz degree of a set A ⊆N by
[A]w = {B ⊆N : A ∼w B},
[A]l = {B ⊆N : A ∼l B}.
By the proof of 7D.3 again, for each A
[A]l ⊆[A]w.
The reducibilities ≤w, ≤l induce partial orderings on the sets of respective degrees
in the obvious way; we will denote these partial orderings by the same symbols “≤w,”
“≤l.”
7D.12. Assume AD and prove that for all A, B ⊆N,
A ≤l ¬B =⇒¬A ≤l B
A <l B =⇒A <l ¬B
and similarly for the Wadge reducibility.
Hint. The ﬁrst implication is immediate. To prove the second, assume A <l B and
notice that by Wadge’s lemma, if A ≤l ¬B does not hold, we have B ≤l A which
contradicts A <l B; thus A ≤l ¬B holds, and we cannot have ¬B ≤l A also, since
this would give ¬B ≤l B by transitivity, thus B ≤l ¬B by the ﬁrst assertion, thus
A <l ¬B by transitivity again.

7D.13. Assume AD and let a, b be arbitrary Lipschitz degrees. Prove that exactly
one of the following holds:
(i) a = b,
(ii) a ̸= b and a = ¬b (i.e., a = [A]l, b = [¬A]l),
(iii) a <l b and a <l ¬b,
(iv) b <l a and ¬b <l a.
Prove the same result for Wadge degrees.

Thus every self-dual degree (b = ¬b) is comparable with all degrees and if b is not
self-dual, then for every a ̸= b, a ̸= ¬b, one of the two patterns in Diagram 7D.1 must
hold in these partial orderings.
The most signiﬁcant fact about Wadge and Lipschitz degrees is the following the-
orem of Martin which essentially asserts that AD put a certain “hierarchy” on the
power of N.
7D.14 (Martin, cf. Martin and Kechris [1980]). Assume AD and prove that the re-
lation <l on Power(N) is wellfounded; infer that <w is also wellfounded.
Hint (Martin, using an idea Leonard Monk had used to prove a special case).
Assume towards a contradiction that
A0 >l A1 >l A2 >l · · ·
so that by 7D.13 we also have
A0 >l ¬A1, A1 >l ¬A2, . . .

and put
Tn = {α : for some (and hence for each) binary sequence

From the deﬁnition of Tn we get
α ∈Tn+1 ⇐⇒(1)bα ∈Tn,
(1)
α /∈Tn+1 ⇐⇒(0)bα ∈Tn,
(2)
which imply immediately that Tn cannot be either meager or comeager, or else the
whole space ù2 would be the union of two meager sets.
In particular, T0 is not meager, so by full determinacy and 6A.14 (or using the
property of Baire for T0), there is a binary sequence s = s0, . . . , sk−1 so that {sbâ :
sbâ /∈T0} is meager. But it is clear from (1) and (2) above iterated k times, that either
α ∈Tk ⇐⇒sbα /∈T0
so that Tk is meager, or
α /∈Tk ⇐⇒sbα /∈T0
so that Tk is comeager and in either case we have reached a contradiction.
⊣
Wadge and Lipschitz degrees have been studied extensively although relatively little
has been published on them; see Wadge [1984], Steel [1977], Van Wesep [1977], [1978a],
[1978b].
There is another simple but very useful lemma of Martin, about Turing degrees.
Recall from 3D that for each α ∈N, the Turing degree of α is deﬁned by
[α]T = {â : α ≤T â & â ≤T α},
where ≤T stands for “recursive in.”
The transitive relation ≤T induces a partial
ordering on the set DT of all Turing degrees.

7. The recursion theorem
[7D.15
7D.15 (Martin [1968]). Assume AD and suppose A ⊆DT is any set of Turing
degrees. Prove that there is some degree d0 such that
either
{d : d0 ≤d} ⊆A
or
{d : d0 ≤d} ⊆DT \ A.
Hint. Consider the game G where I and II produce α and
I wins ⇐⇒[α]T ∈A.
If I wins with a strategy ó, take d0 = [ó]T and for any degree d ≥d0, have II play some
â with [â]T = d; now the resulting play ó ∗[â] easily has degree d, so that d ∈A.
The argument is similar in the case II wins the game.
⊣
This is the typical result where we assume full determinacy but where the proof
makes it clear just how much determinacy is needed for each speciﬁc application. For
example:
7D.16 (Martin [1975]). Prove that if A ⊆N is a Borel set such that
α ∈A & α ≡T â =⇒â ∈A,
then there is a degree d0 such that
either
{α : d0 ≤[α]T } ⊆A
or
{α : d0 ≤[α]T } ⊆N \ A.
Hint. Appeal to the determinacy of Borel sets.
⊣
This result has interesting consequences in the theory of Turing degrees which we
will not pursue here.
At the same time, 7D.15 also has some interesting and surprising consequences in
the presence of full determinacy.
7D.17 (Martin [1968]). Assume AD and let U be the set of all subsets of the set of
Turing degrees which contain cones,
A ∈U ⇐⇒there is some degree d0 such that {d : d0 ≤d} ⊆A.
Prove that U is an ℵ1-complete, non-principal ultraﬁlter on DT so that the function
ì(A) =
(
1
if A ∈U,
0
if A /∈U,
is an ℵ1-additive measure on DT .
Hint. Use the countable axiom of choice for pointsets to show that for every se-
quence of degrees d0, d1, d2, . . . there is some d ∗above all of them—this comes up in
checking ℵ1-completeness.
⊣
What is perhaps even more surprising is that we can carry the Martin measure on
DT to a measure on ℵ1.
7D.18 (Solovay). Assume AD and show that ℵ1 is a measurable cardinal.
Hint. Recall from 4F that for each α ∈N,
ùα
1 = supremum{|â| : â ≤T α & â ∈WO}
and for each degree d put
ùd
1 = ùα
1 ,
where α is any irrational in d.
Let U be the Martin ultraﬁlter on DT and for A ⊆ℵ1, put
A ∈U∗⇐⇒{d : ùd
1 ∈A} ∈U.

7E. Historical remarks
339
As we mentioned in the historical remarks at the end of Chapter 6, this early result of
Solovay was instrumental in focusing the attention of set theorists to determinacy. It
came before Blackwell [1967] and the subsequent development of the structure theory
from PD.
The proof of 7D.18 sketched above is obviously due to Martin. Solovay’s original
proof was a bit more complicated but also more amenable to generalization: Solovay
extended it to show from AD that ℵ2 is also measurable and then Kunen proved
further that all the ä
e
1
n are in fact measurable cardinals. (It was already known that
in the absence of the Axiom of Choice measurable cardinals need not be large, see
Jech [1968].)
For these and other results relating determinacy with measurability see Kechris
[1978a] (and the references given there) as well as the forthcoming monograph Martin
[20??].
The next exercise is implicit in the proof of 7D.8 but it is worth pointing to it.
7D.19. Assume AD and prove that for every ë < Θ, there exists
a surjection
ð : N ։ Power(ë) (Moschovakis [1970]); infer that Θ is a limit cardinal (Friedman).
⊣
Finally, the last exercise gives an interesting corollary of the Coding Lemma.
7D.20. Let Γ be a Spector pointclass closed under ∀N , let
ϕ : P ։ ë
be a regular Γ-norm on some set P ⊆Γ \ ∆
e
and for each set A ⊆ë, put
Code(A; ϕ) = {x : ϕ(x) ∈A}.
Assume AD and prove that for each set A, Code(A; ϕ) is in Γ
e
. (Solovay for Γ = Π1
1,
Moschovakis [1970] in general.)
Hint. Assume P ⊆N for simplicity and consider the game where I plays α, II plays
â and
II wins ⇐⇒α /∈P ∨

α ∈P & (∀ã)

ã ≤∗
ϕ α =⇒[ϕ(ã) ∈A ⇐⇒G(â, ã)]
	
,
where G ⊆N × N is universal in Γ.
If I wins with some strategy ó, then by the Covering Lemma 4C.11 there is some
î < ë such that
(∀â)

ó ∗[â] ∈P & ϕ(ó ∗[â]) < î

and then the Coding Lemma implies easily that II can beat this ó; thus II wins with
some ô and
α ∈Code(A; ϕ) ⇐⇒G([α] ∗ô, α).
⊣
These games where we insure that player II wins by forcing I to play ordinal codes
are called Solovay games; they were used by Solovay in one of his original proofs (from
AD) of the measurability of ℵ1.
7E. Historical remarks
1The Recursion Theorem was ﬁrst proved in Kleene [1938] in connection with the
theory of constructive ordinals. Kleene used it erroneously in his [1944] to claim (in

340
7. The recursion theorem
[7E
eﬀect) that every relation on ù which is positive Π0
1-inductive on ù is Π0
2. This false
claim in one of the basic ﬁrst papers of the eﬀective theory is amusingly reminiscent
of the similar false claim of Lebesgue [1905], but there is little to connect the actual
mathematical mistakes in the two papers. In any case, Kleene was his own Suslin: he
corrected the mistake himself in his fundamental paper [1955a] where he characterized
(essentially) the Π1
1 pointsets in terms of Π0
1-induction on ù (7C.2), and where he laid
the foundations of the technique of eﬀective transﬁnite recursion.
2Kleene proved his version of what we have called here the Suslin-Kleene Theorem
in his [1955c], after a good deal of preliminary work in his [1955b]. He established
that a relation on ù is ∆1
1 exactly when it is hyperarithmetical but with a deﬁnition of
“hyperarithmetical” which was bound up with the notion of constructive ordinal. The
essential content of his theorem is given in 7B.7. On the other hand, his proof (though
technically quite complicated) was certainly suﬃcient to yield the full Suslin-Kleene
Theorem 7B.4, at least for pointsets of type 0 and 1.
3As is obvious from the remarks above Kleene established the basic properties of
positive induction on ù (especially in his [1955a]) although he did not introduced
the notions explicitly; this was done by Spector [1961] who also proved (iii) and (iv)
of 7C.2.
4Moschovakis [1974a] gives a detailed development of positive elementary induc-
tion on abstract structures, which includes (and has as one of its most interesting
examples) what we have called here positive analytical induction on N. Before that,
Moschovakis [1969], [1971b] introduced and established the basic properties of induc-
tive and hyperprojective pointsets (of type 1), using a diﬀerent, recursion-theoretic
approach.
5We have tried to give the credits for results from AD in the main text of 7D, but a
few clariﬁcations must be made.
6The Coding Lemma 7D.5, 7D.6 in its present form was proved by Moschovakis
[1970], but it owes much to earlier (unpublished) results of Friedman and Solovay.
7Theorem 7D.8 gives a collection of results by several persons which are hard to
untangle. It is a bit easier to give speciﬁc credits for the facts about the ordinals ä
e
1
n
in 7D.11 since these were the preoccupation of early research in the area.
8Moschovakis [1970] introduced the ordinals ä
e
1
n and proved (from AD of course)
that they are all cardinals and that if n is odd, then ó
e
1
n = ä
e
1
n, ä
e
1
n is regular and
ä
e
1
n−1 < ä
e

n. Martin and Kunen showed (independently) in 1971 that for even n,
ó
e
1
n = ä
e
1
n, ä
e
1
n is regular and ä
e
1
n = (ä
e
1
n−1)+. Finally Kechris [1974] proved that for odd
n, ä
e
1
n = κ+
n for a cardinal κn of coﬁnality ù and that for even n, ä
e
1
n−1 < ä
e
1
n.
9Moschovakis [1983] constructed deﬁnable scales on coinductive sets from appro-
priate determinacy hypotheses, and Martin and Steel [1983] extended the method
of proof to give a complete characterization of the pointsets which admit scales in
L(R), assuming Det(L(R) ∩Power(N). These results were announced in Martin,
Moschovakis, and Steel [1982].
10The Martin-Steel-Woodin Theorem mentioned in the historical notes to Chapter 6
says precisely that AD holds in L(N), justifying (on the basis of unexpectedly weak
large cardinal axioms) this “hope” of those who derived consequences of AD in the
1960’s and 70’s.

7F. Results which depend on the Axiom of Choice

where ù(0) = 1 and ù(n + 1) = ùù(n) (ordinal exponentiation). See Jackson [1988],
[1989], [1999] and Kechris, L¨owe, and Steel [2008] (and the further references given
there) for this and many more basic results on related problems obtained since the ﬁrst
edition of this book.
7F. Appendix; a list of results which depend on the Axiom of Choice
We have marked by AC all results which we proved by appealing to the full Axiom of
Choice. Here we will list them and group them according to how essential this appeal
to AC is, and whether it can be avoided by modifying either the proof we have given
or the statement of the result (or both); the determinacy of Borel sets established in
Section 6F is an important, special case which deserves its own grouping.
We assume without comment the Axiom of Dependent Choices DC.
A. Results which depend essentially on the full Axiom of Choice.
2C.4. There is an uncountable set of reals which has no non-empty perfect subset.
2H.6. There is a set of reals without the property of Baire.
2H.9. There is a set of reals which is not Lebesgue measurable.
6A.1. If II does not win the game A(u), then there is some a such that for all b,
II does not win A
 ub(a, b)

.
6A.6. There is a set A ⊆ù2 which is not determined.
6G.9. Every measurable cardinal is strongly inaccessible.
It is not hard to see that the innocuous sounding 6A.1 is in fact equivalent to the
Axiom of Choice. Given R ⊆A × B such that (∀x ∈A)(∃y ∈B)R(x, y), consider
the two-move game A where I plays x, II plays y and II wins if R(x, y); now if there
is no choice function f : A →B such that (∀x ∈A)R
 x, f(x)

, then II does not win
the game, while for each x there is obviously some y such that II wins A(x, y)—which
is ﬁnished before it starts.
B. Results whose proofs must be modiﬁed.
There are three signiﬁcant theorems which can be proved without appeal to the
Axiom of Choice, but where we chose to use choice in the proofs we gave.
2B.1. For every inﬁnite cardinal κ and every pointset P ⊆X, the following condi-
tions are equivalent.
(i) P is κ-Suslin, i.e.,
P = pC = {x : (∃f ∈ùκ)C(x, f)}
with a closed C ⊆X × ùκ.
(ii) P admits a κ-semiscale.
(iii) P = A κ
u Pu, where the κ-Suslin system u 7→Pu is regular.
(iv) P = A κ
u Pu with a κ-Suslin system u 7→Pu where each Pu is closed.
The beginning of the proof of 2B.1 asks for a choice of some fx ∈ùκ such that
(x, fx) ∈C, but no principle of choice is required for this, because we can take fx to
be the leftmost branch of the tree {f : C(x, f)}, deﬁned in 4E.8; i.e., we can take
fx(0) = the least î such that (∃f)[C(x, f) & f(0) = î],
fx(n + 1) = the least î such that (∃f)[C(x, f)
& f0 = fx(0), . . . , f(n) = fx(n)].

[7F
2F.3. Every Σ

e
1
2n+2 set is the union of ä
e
1
2n+1 sets each of
which is ä
e
1
2n+1-Borel.
A proof of these two results which does not use the Axiom of Choice is part of the
proof of 7D.10.
C. Results which can be reformulated so that they do not depend on the Axiom of
Choice.
2F.4. If P ⊆X is ℵn-Suslin (n ≥1), then
P = S
î<ℵn Pî
where each Pî is Borel.
Reformulation (for n = 2, as an example). If P is ℵ2-Suslin, then there is a sequence
of sets {Pî : î < ℵ2} such that
P = S
î<ℵ2 Pî
and such that for each î < ℵ2, there is a sequence of sets {Qç : ç < ℵ1} such that each
Qç is Borel and
Pî = S
ç<ℵ1 Qç.
To prove 2F.4 for n = 2 from this we must choose for each î < ℵ2 a sequence
{Qç : ç < ℵ1} with the requisite property.
6A.2. Every closed subset of ùX is determined.
6A.3. Every Σ
e
0
2 subset of ùX is determined.
The problem in the proofs of these basic theorems is that we need to make choices
from X in order to deﬁne the required strategies—directly understood, 6A.2 in fact is
equivalent to the full Axiom of Choice, just like 6A.1.
First reformulation. Assume that the space X in which the games are played is
countable. Now the proof of 6A.1 uses only the countable axiom of choice, and 6A.2,
6A.3 follow from 6A.1 without any use of choice.
Second reformulation. Weaken these results by allowing the players to play sets of
moves, as follows.
A multiple-valued strategy or quasistrategy for player I in the space X is any set ó of
ﬁnite sequences from X such that:
(i) For some x0, (x0) ∈ó.
(ii) If (x0, . . . , x2n) ∈ó, then for every y ∈X, (x0, . . . , x2n, y) ∈ó.
(iii) If (x0, . . . , x2n+1) ∈ó, then for some y ∈X, (x0, . . . , x2n+1, y) ∈ó.
We say that I follows ó in a run (x0, x1, x2, . . . ) of a game G on X if for each n,
(x0, . . . , xn) ∈ó,
and we call ó winning for I in G if whenever I follows ó in (x0, x1, x2, . . . ), we have
(x0, x1, x2, . . . ) ∈G.
Quasistrategies for II are deﬁned in the obvious way and we say that G is quaside-
termined if either I or II has a winning quasistrategy.
It is clear that if the set X admits a wellordering, then every winning quasistrategy
for I or II determines a winning strategy for the same player, so that a game G on a
wellorderable space X is determined exactly when it is quasidetermined.

7F]
7F. Results which depend on the Axiom of Choice
343
Reformulation of 6A.2 and 6A.3: replace “determined” by “quasidetermined” in
the statements of these results.
Proof of the reformulation of 6A.2. Given a closed F ⊆ùX with open complement
G, deﬁne the sets W î of sequences of even length by induction on î (as in the proof
of 6A.3),
u ∈W 0 ⇐⇒if f ∈ùX is an extension of u, then f ∈G,
u ∈W î ⇐⇒(∀a)(∃b)(∃ç < î)[ub(a, b) ∈W ç].
If ∅/∈W ∞= S

ó = {(x0, . . . , xn−1) : for each i < n, (x0, . . . , xi) /∈W ∞}
is easily a winning quasistrategy for I. If ∅∈W ∞, let
|u| = least î such that u ∈W î (u ∈W ∞)
and check easily that
ó = {(x0, . . . , xn−1) : for each odd i < n, (x0, . . . , xi) ∈W ∞
and if i + 2 < n, |x0, . . . , xi| > |x0, . . . , xi, xi+1, xi+2|}
is a winning quasistrategy for II.

7C.4. A pointset R ⊆X is absolutely inductive if and only if there is a Σ1
1 set P such
that
R(x) ⇐⇒{(∃α0)(∀α1)(∃α2)(∀α3) · · · }(∃n)P(x, ⟨α0, . . . , αn−1⟩).
Here too we must understand the inﬁnite alternating string on the right in terms of
winning quasistrategies in order to prove 7C.4 without appealing to the full Axiom of
Choice.
D. Borel determinacy.
The determinacy of Borel games on every X (Theorem 6F.1) cannot be proved
without AC, since it implies 6E.1 and hence the full Axiom of Choice. However, the
foundationally most important special case of determinacy of Borel games on ù can
be proved without AC, in two fundamentally diﬀerent ways.
First, we can use the metamathematical results of Chapter 8 to infer the determinacy
of Borel games on ù from Martin ’s proof. This is a fairly simple argument and we
will outline it ﬁrst.
Second, every Borel game on an arbitrary set X is quasidetermined, by a result of
Tonny Hurkens in his doctoral dissertation Hurkens [1993]. We will prove this result
of Hurkens here in a rather round-about fashion which is closer to the methods we
have been using and introduces the interesting notion of parametric determinacy.
D1. The metamathematical argument. If A ⊆N is Borel, then
x ∈A ⇐⇒PΣ(ε∗, x) ⇐⇒PΠ(ε∗, x),

344
7. The recursion theorem
[7F
where ε∗∈N and the relations PΣ(ε, x) and PΠ(ε, x) are Σ1
1 and Π1
1 respectively. The
relation
R(ε) ⇐⇒(∀x)[PΣ(ε, x) ⇐⇒PΠ(ε, x)]
is evidently Π1
2, and so absolute for the model L(ε∗) by Shoenﬁeld’s Theorem 8F.9;
and since it holds in the world for ε∗, we also have
L(ε∗) |= (∀x)[PΣ(ε∗, x) ⇐⇒PΠ(ε∗, x)],
which means that A′ = A ∩L(ε∗) is a ∆1
1(ε∗) set and hence a Borel set in L(ε∗). Since
L(ε∗) satisﬁes AC, A′ is determined in L(ε∗), by Martin’s proof. Suppose, without
loss of generality, that player I wins the game it determines: so there is some ó ∈L(ε∗)
such that
L(ε∗) |= (∀ô)PΠ(ε∗, ó ∗ô);
and since the relation
R′(ε, ó) ⇐⇒(∀ô)PΠ(ε, ó ∗ô)
is evidently Π1
1 and holds of (ε∗, ó) in L(ε∗), it holds of (ε∗, ó) in the world, by
Shoenﬁeld’s Theorem again. This says precisely that ó is a winning strategy for I in A.
D2. Parametric determinacy. Given a tree T on X, a set A ⊆ùX and a set Π ̸= ∅,
consider the following game GΠ
I (A, T), which is auxilliary for player I to the game
G(A, T) deﬁned in Section 6F and runs like this:
I
∅̸= Π0 ⊆Π<ù
x0
∅̸= Π2 ⊆Π<ù
x2
. . .
II
ð0 ∈Π0
x1
ð2 ∈Π2
x3
As indicated, the rules are that for each i
∅̸= Π2i ⊆Π<ù and ð2i ∈Π2i
together with the rules for G(A, T), i.e., that (x0, . . . , xn) ∈T for all n; and if both
players follow the rules for the entire run, then I wins if (x0, x1, . . . ) ∈A. The auxilliary
game GΠ
II (A, T) for player II is deﬁned similarly, with typical runs of the form
I
x0
ð1 ∈Π1
x2
ð3 ∈Π3
· · ·
II
∅̸= Π1 ⊆Π<ù
x1
∅̸= Π3 ⊆Π<ù
x3
and the corresponding rules.
The idea is that player I needs some help to choose his move at each turn, but the
choices he needs are not from subsets of X, as for a quasistrategy, but from a (possibly)
much larger set of sequences from a set Π. At each of his turns, I presents II with a
non-empty set Π2i ⊆Π<ù from which II must choose some ð2i: and then, using ð2i,
I can produce his move x2i in the original game.
A Π-strategy for I in G(A, T) is any strategy for I in GΠ
I (A, T), and it is winning
if I wins GΠ
I (A, T) with it—and analogously for player II; G(A, T) is Π-determined
if either I or II has a winning Π-strategy, and it is parametrically determined, if it is
Π-determined for some Π.
Every quasistrategy Σ for I in G(A, T) can be viewed as a parametric Π-strategy
for any Π ⊇X, in which the moves by I are given (as functions of the relevant earlier
moves) by
Π2m(x0, x1, . . . , x2m−1) = {(x) | (x0, x1, . . . , x2m−1, x) ∈Σ},
x2m((x)) = x,

345
and similarly for quasistrategies for II. Thus quasiderminacy implies parametric de-
terminacy.
We collect in a simple exercise the basic facts about parametric strategies.
7F.1. (i) Prove that if I has a winning Π-strategy in G(A, T) and Π ⊆Π′, then I
also has a winning Π′-strategy in G(A, T) (and similarly for II).
(ii) Prove that there is no game G(A, T) for which both I and II have winning
parametric strategies.
(iii) Prove that if Π is wellorderable and I has a winning Π-strategy in G(A, T),
then I wins G(A, T) (and similarly for II).
(iv) Prove that if X is countable and I has a winning parametric strategy, then I
wins G(A, T) (and similarly for II); it follows that if a game on ù is parametrically
determined, then it is determined.
The most interesting part of this Exercise is (iv), whose proof requires the Axiom
of Dependent Choices.
7F.2. Theorem (Reformulation of 6F.1). For each X ̸= ∅, each tree T on X and
each Borel set A ⊆ùX, the game G(A, T) is parametrically determined.
Together with (iv) of 7F.1 above, this theorem implies the most signiﬁcant corollary
of Martin’s Theorem, that every Borel game on ù is determined.
Next we outline the modiﬁcations that must be made to the proof of Theorem 6F.1
to establish Theorem 7F.2 without appealing to (the full) AC.
7F.3. Lemma. If A ⊆ùX is closed, then G(A, T) is Π-determined for every Π ⊇X.
This is because G(A, T) is quasidetermined by the reformulation of 6A.2 above,
and the winning quasistrategy (for either player) can be viewed as a Π-strategy for any
Π ⊇X.
Notice that the Π-strategies for I or II in G(A, T) are determined by the tree T and
the parameter set Π, i.e., they do not depend on the set A. So for any tree T on X and
any Π ̸= ∅, we let
ΣI
p(Π, T) = the set of strategies for I in GΠ
I (A, T)
(any A),
ΣI
∗,p(Π, T) = S
m ΣI
p(Π, T ↾(2m)).
We will also write
(Π0, ð0, x0, x1, . . . , Π2m, ð2m, x2m, . . . ) ≈X (Π′

for the important relation of X-equivalence between two runs of GΠ
I (A, T). These
notations and relations are deﬁned analogously for the auxilliary games GΠ
II (A, T) for
player II.
A parametric covering c : S ⇝T of a tree T on X by a tree S on Y is a quadruple
c = (c, Π, cI, cII)
(1)
satisfying the following conditions (PC1) – (PC3).
(PC1) The space map c : S →T of c is a monotone, length–preserving mapping,
as in (C1) of Section 6F.
(PC2) The parameter set Π of c is non-empty, and the mapping
cI : ΣI
∗,p(Π, S) →ΣI
∗,p(Π, T)

7. The recursion theorem
[7F.4
assigns a partial Π-strategy cI(ó) on T for player I to every partial Π-strategy ó on S
for I, so that
ó′ = ó ↾(2m) =⇒cI(ó′) = cI(ó) ↾(2m).
This coherence condition allows us to extend cI to ó ∈ΣI
p(Π, S),
cI(ó) = S
m cI(ó ↾(2m)).
We also assume the analogous condition for cII, which maps partial, Π-strategies
for II on the tree S to partial Π-strategies for II of the same length on the tree T.
(PC3) The liftup or simulation condition. The space map c extends naturally to the
runs of GΠ
I (A, T):
c(Π0, ð0, y0, y1, . . . , Π2m, ð2m, y2m, . . . )
= (Π0, ð0, x0, x1, . . . , Π2m, ð2m, x2m, . . . ),
where c(y0, y1, . . . , y2m) = (x0, x1, . . . , x2m). With this notation, we assume that for
every ó ∈ΣI
∗,p(Π, S),
u ∈cI(ó) =⇒(∃v ∈ó)[c(v) ≈X u],
and for every total, Π-strategy ó ∈ΣI
p(Π, S),
f ∈[cI(ó)] =⇒(∃g ∈[ó])[c(g) ≈X f].
We also assume the analogous condition for cII.
A parametric covering as in (1) unravels a game G(A, T) if the inverse image
c−1[A] = c−1[A ∩[T]] is a (strong) clopen subset of the space [S], i.e., for some open
and closed C ⊆ùY,
f ∈C ⇐⇒c(f) ∈A
(f ∈[S]).
Notice that as with the simpler coverings of Section 6F, if c : S ⇝T unravels G(A, T),
then it also unravels G(ùX \ A, T).
7F.4. Lemma (Reformulation of 6F.2). If A ⊆ùX and some parametric covering
c : S ⇝T with S a tree on Y and parameter set Π ⊇Y unravels G(A, T), then
G(A, T) is parametrically determined.
Proof is exactly like that of Lemma 6F.2, using Π-strategies and appealing to
Lemma 7F.3 instead of the Gale-Stewart Theorem.
⊣
As in Section 6F, a parametric covering c : S ⇝T is n-ﬁxing (an n-covering) if it just
copies up to stage n, i.e., S ↾n = T ↾n; for m ≤n, c((x0, . . . , xm)) = (x0, . . . , xm);
if 2m ≤n and ó ∈ΣI
p(Π, S ↾(2m)), then cI(ó) = ó; and the corresponding condition
for ô ∈ΣII
p (Π, S ↾(2m + 1)), if 2m + 1 ≤n.
If i < n, then every n-covering is also an i-covering.
Finally, a set A ⊆ùX parametrically unravels fully if for every tree T, every continu-
ous function f : [T] →ùX and every k, there is some tree S with S ↾k = T ↾k such
that for some Π∗and every Π ⊇Π∗, there is a k-covering c : S ⇝T with parameter
set Π which unravels the game G(f−1[A], T).
We let as before
U ↾ùX = {A ⊆ùX : A unravels fully},
so that U is now the class of sets in all spaces ùX which parametrically unravel fully.
Every set in U is (in particular) unraveled by some c : S ⇝T with S a tree on some

Y and parameter set Π ⊇Y, so that by Lemma 7F.4, it is parametrically determined.
Moreover, as with the deﬁnition in Section 6F, U is obviously closed under continuous
preimages and complementation: thus, to establish Theorem 7F.2, it suﬃces to prove
that U contains all closed sets and that it is closed under countable intersections.
7F.5. Lemma (Reformulation of Lemma 6F.3). Every closed set parametrically un-
ravels fully.
Proof is a mild embellishment of the proof of Lemma 6F.3: we use the same
notation and the same auxilliary game on
Y = X ∪(X × Power(S)) ∪(X × (S ∪{0})).
We let Π∗= Y, and we only need to provide some additional instructions to deﬁne
the required maps from the partial Π-strategies on the auxilliary game to the partial
Π-strategies of G(A, T), for any Π ⊇Π∗. We will omit the details, except for the
following, brief remarks on the required changes in the two cases of the proof of
Lemma 6F.3 (for k = 0).
Case I. Given ó ∈ΣI
∗,p(Π, S), player I moves by cI(ó) in T so that
v = (Π0, ð0, ⟨x0, P⟩, ⟨x1, 0⟩, Π2, ð2, x2, x3, . . . , xn) ∈ó,
i.e., I assumes temporarily that II accepted his oﬀer. If the moves of II are such that
(x0, x1, . . . , xn) ∈T \ J as long as ó applies, then the play in GΠ
I (A, T) by cI(ó) is
u = (Π0, ð0, x0, x1, , Π2, ð2, x2, x3, . . . , xn)
and the liftup condition is satisﬁed since (in fact) c(v) = u. Suppose that at some
(ﬁrst) stage I moves in GΠ
I (A, T) so that (x0, . . . , x2l+1) /∈J. The rules of the game
ensure that (x0, . . . , x2l+1) ∈P, and that there is an initial run of GΠ
I (c−1[A], S) of
the form
v′ = (Π0, ð0, ⟨x0, P⟩, ⟨x1, (x0, . . . , x2l+1)⟩,
Π′
2, ð′
2, x2, x3, . . . , Π′
2l, ð′
2l, x2l, x2l+1),
where the sets Π′
2i (for i ≤l) are determined by ó and the choices ð′
2i are arbitrary,
as long as ð2i ∈Π′
2i so that the rules of the game are obeyed. To continue playing
using ó and such a (new) simulation, I needs a speciﬁc sequence ð′
2, . . . ð′
2l with these
properties: and he can force II to give him one by moving
Π2l+2 = {ð′
2 ∗ð′
4 ∗· · · ∗ð′
2l | v′ ∈ó},
where v′ is deﬁned above and ∗is the concatenation operation on sequences. (In more
detail: I plays the set of all sequences from Π which can be viewed as concatenations
of sequences that with ó deﬁne an initial run v′ of GΠ
I (A, T), and then computes the
“minimal” such decomposition ð′
2, . . . , ð′
2l of the sequence supplied by II.) Now I
continues to play by ó as if v′ were the sequence of the players’ moves up to that point,
and it is clear that the (weak) liftup condition is satisﬁed.
Case II. Given ô ∈ΣII
∗,p(Π, S) and a ﬁrst move x0 by I in GΠ
II (A, T), we set
P = {u ∈T | for all Q ⊆T, Π1 ⊆Π<ù, ð1 ∈Π1 and x1 ∈X,
(⟨x0, Q⟩, Π1, ð1, ⟨x1, u⟩) /∈ô}.

348
7. The recursion theorem
[7F.6
Player II simulates I’s ﬁrst move in GΠ
II (c−1[A], S) by ⟨x0, P⟩and he plays in GΠ
II (A, T)
so that the simulating run is
(⟨x0, P⟩, Π1, ð1, ⟨x1, 0⟩, x2, Π3, ð3, x3, . . . ),
where ô provides him with Π1, x1, Π3, x3, . . . while I’s moves in GΠ
II (A, T) determine
ð1, x2, ð3, x4 . . . . Notice that ô could not have required a play ⟨x1, u⟩for some u ̸= 0;
because then (⟨x0, P⟩, Π1, ð1, ⟨x1, u⟩) ∈ô which puts u /∈P and violate the rules of
G(c−1[A], S) in the very ﬁrst move by II. If I moves so that (x0, . . . , x2l+1) ∈P for
every l (as long as ô applies), then the liftup condition is satisﬁed trivially. Suppose
that for some (ﬁrst) stage 2l, when the simulating run is
v = (⟨x0, P⟩, Π1, ð1, ⟨x1, 0⟩, x2, . . . , x2l−1, x2l),
I’ last move x2l is such that for some y,
u = (x0, . . . , x2l, y) ∈T \ P;
the deﬁnition of P guarantees an alternative simulating run
v′ = (⟨x0, Q⟩, Π′
1, ð′
1, ⟨x1, u⟩, x2, . . . , x2l, Π′
2l+1, ð′
2l+1, x2l+1) ∈ô,
where Π′
1, Π′
3, . . . are determined by ô and ð′
1, ð′
3, . . . are arbitrary but such that the
rules of the game are obeyed. To continue playing with ô, II needs to know one such
alternative run, and he can force I to give him one by moving
Π2l+1 = {⟨x0, Q⟩∗ð′
1 ∗· · · ∗ð′
2l+1 | v′ ∈ô},
where v′ is deﬁned above and the concatenation is interpreted as in Case I. Now II
continues to play with ô as if this v′ were the run so far, and, as in Case I, the liftup
condition is satisﬁed.
⊣
The results about coverings in Section 6F which follow Lemma 6F.3 can be very
easily generalized to parametric coverings, and so we will conﬁne ourselves here to the
correct statements of these facts.
7F.6. Lemma (Reformulation of 6F.4). For any two parametric coverings
T2 ⇝c1 T1 ⇝c0 T0,
with the same parameter set Π, deﬁne the composition c = c0c1 = (c, cI, cII) : T2 ⇝T0
by
c(u) = c0(c1(u)), cI(ó) = cI
0(cI
1(ó)), cII(ó) = cII
0 (cII
1 (ó)).
This is also a parametric covering c : T2 ⇝T0 with parameter set Π, and if c1 and c0
are both k-ﬁxing, then so is c.
7F.7. Lemma (Reformulation of 6F.5). The intersection A ∩B ⊆ùX of two sets
which parametrically unravel fully, parametrically unravels fully.
7F.8. Lemma (Reformulation of 6F.6). Fix Π ̸= ∅and suppose that for each i, ci :
Ti+1 ⇝Ti is a (k + i)-covering with parameter set Π; then there there exists a tree S
and, for each i, a (k + i)-covering di : S ⇝Ti with parameter set Π such that for each
i,
di = cidi+1.
7F.9. Theorem (Reformulation of 6F.7). The class U of sets which parametrically
unravel fully is closed under countable intersections.

Outline of proof. The space maps of the required coverings are constructed as
in the proof of 6F.7, and each ci can be extended to a covering ci relative to any
parameter set Π ⊇Π∗
i , for some Π∗
i ; we then take Π∗= ∪iΠ∗
i and argue that we can
apply Lemma 7F.8 with this Π∗.
⊣
It follows from this theorem and Lemma 7F.5 that every Borel subset of ùX unravels
fully, which with Lemma 7F.4 completes the proof of Theorem 7F.2.
There remains the question of the relation between parametric determinacy and
quasideterminacy, and we ﬁrst notice that, in general, the ﬁrst does not imply the
second without substantial choice assumptions:
7F.10 (Neeman). If every parametrically determined game on ℵ1 is quasideter-
mined, then there is a function f : ℵ1 →N such that for every countable ordinal î,
F (î) ∈WO & |f(î)| = î.
Hint. Consider the game where I plays some countable ordinal î,II plays a sequence
α = (a0, a1, . . . ), and II wins if α ∈WO & |α| = î. Now II has a winning parametric
strategy on Π = N, because he can respond to I’s move by Π1 = {(α) | α ∈
WO & |α| = î} forcing I to give him a winning sequence for his subsequent moves;
but a winning quasistrategy for II yields a winning strategy, since II is playing in ù,
and that is a function which selects a code for each countable î.
⊣
On the other hand, every parametrically determined Borel game on an arbitrary set
X is quasidetermined. Although not diﬃcult, the proof of this result (due to Neeman)
requires a generalization of the Third Periodicity Theorem 6E.1 to arbitrary spaces
ùX which has some independent interest. We outline it in the remaining exercises of
this section.
7F.11. The class B of Borel subsets of ùX is the smallest class of subsets of ùX which
contains the open and the closed sets and is closed under countable intersections and
countable unions.
Hint. Let B′ be the smallest class of subsets of ùX which contains Σ
e
0
1 and Π
e
0
1 and
is closed under countable intersections and unions, and prove by induction that for
every countable î, Σ
e
0
î, Π
e

î ⊆B′. The converse is trivial by the closure properties of
B.
⊣
As in Section 2B for N = ùù, a ë-norm on a set P ⊆ùX is any function ϕ : P →ë,
and a ë-semiscale on P is any sequence ϕ = {ϕn} of ë-norms on P with the following
convergence property: if xi ∈P for every i, xi →x, and for each n the sequence of
ordinals {ϕn(xi)} is ultimately constant, then x ∈P.
7F.12. Every Borel set A ⊆ùX admits an ù-semiscale ϕ such that for all n, w ∈ù,
the set
An,w = {x ∈A | ϕn(x) = w}
is Borel.
Hint. If G is open, let
Ni(x) = {y ∈ùX | (∀j < i)[y(j) = x(j)}
be the neighborhood of x determined by its ﬁrst i values and set
ϕn(x) = ìi[Ni(x) ⊆G]
(n = 0, 1, . . . );

this (constant) sequence of norms is clearly a semiscale, and the set

7F.13. Theorem (Hurkens [1993]). Every Borel game on a set X is quasidetermined.
Outline of proof (Neeman). Suppose A ⊆ùX, and I has a parametric winning
strategy for A. For each u = (u0, . . . , uk) with even k, let
Au = {(a0, a1, . . . ) | u ∗(a0, a1, . . . ) ∈A}

be the subgame of A starting with u, in which II moves ﬁrst. This is a Borel (and
hence parametrically determined) game on X, and we let
Wk = {⟨u0, . . . , uk⟩| I wins parametrically Au}.
This set of winning positions for I is not empty: for example, every sequence “com-
patible” with a winning parametric strategy for I in A is winning. Moreover, the set Σ
of initial segments of S
k Wk is (easily) a quasistrategy for I in A, but it need not be
winning. To get a winning quasistrategy we generalize the construction in the proof
of the Third Periodicity Theorem 6E.1 to Borel games on X.
Fix a semiscale φ on A and (as in Lemma 7F.12), for any two sequences
u = (u0, . . . , uk), v = (v0, . . . , vk) ∈Wk
deﬁne the game H(u, v) with players F and S whose runs are illustrated in Dia-
gram 6E.1 and whose payoﬀis
{(α, â) | v ∗â /∈A ∨(∀i ≤k)φi(u ∗α) ≤φi(v ∗â)}.
These games are all Borel and so parametrically determined.
Lemma. The relation
u ≤∗
k v ⇐⇒u, v ∈Wk and S wins parametrically the game Hu,v
is a prewellordering of Wk.
Proof is very much like that of Theorem 6D.3, except for the proof of the transitivity
of the relation ≤∗
k, for which we need to construct a parametric strategy from two given
ones and we cannot appeal to arbitrary choices for the moves not determined by the
given parametric strategies. The idea is illustrated in Diagram 7F.1: given winning
parametric strategies for S in H(u, v) and H(v, w) on the (disjoint) parameter sets Πu
and Πv, we let Π = Πu ∪Πv, and we show how S can win H(u, w) on this parameter
set by copying moves and forcing F to give him the required parameters in the two
auxilliary games. For example, for the construction of the ﬁrst move in X shown in
the diagram, S plays
Π0 = {ðu ∗ðv | (∃Πu
0, b0, Πv
0)[(b0, Πv
0, ðv
0) ∈óu) & (a0, Πu
0, ðu
0, b0) ∈óv]}
where óu, óv are winning strategies for S in H(u, v) and H(v, w) respectively. The
remaining parts of the proof of this Lemma are about speciﬁc runs of the game and we
can use DC to ﬁll in the required moves without appealing to the rules for parametric
strategies.
⊣(Lemma)
Finally, as in the proof of Thereom 6E.1, we deﬁne minimal wining positions and
we verify that the set Σ of initial segments of them is a winning quasistrategy for I in
A; the key construction is a natural, parametric adaptation of the diagrams of games
illustrated in Diagrams 6E.2 and 6E.3, and it is quite simple, with DC providing all
the required extra moves.

CHAPTER 8
METAMATHEMATICS
In this last chapter we will study brieﬂy the metamathematical method, the key tool for
establishing consistency and independence results. Here too we presuppose no knowl-
edge of formal logic—we will develop in some detail all the preliminary material that
we need. We are, however, assuming a good understanding of (informal, axiomatic)
set theory, as we have been using it in the ﬁrst seven chapters of this book.
The chief aim of mathematics is to study certain concrete mathematical structures,
e.g., the semiring ù of integers, the ﬁeld R of real numbers or, in set theory, the universe
V of sets. What we do in actual fact is to consider various propositions about these
structures and attempt to determine their truth or falsity. We often use the axiomatic
method for precision and elegance: certain fairly obvious propositions are designated
axioms and whatever assertions we make after this are supposed to follow from the
axioms by logic alone.
The essence of the metamathematical method consists in identifying and making
precise the language L in which we make assertions about a particular structure A.
Typically we take L to be the ﬁrst order language associated with A—this is simple but
suﬃciently expressive so we can formulate in it most of the propositions about A we
care to consider. We will look at these languages in 8A.
Suppose è is a particular proposition of L which may be true or false in A—perhaps
we have not been able to determine this yet.
Suppose we can ﬁnd an alternative
interpretation of all the propositions in L, such that all the axioms are true in this
interpretation but è fails; this clearly establishes that è cannot follow from the axioms
by logic alone, assuming at least that truth in our alternative interpretation is preserved
under logical deduction. In these circumstances we say that è is independent of the
axioms or that the negation of è is consistent with the axioms.
One powerful method for constructing alternative interpretations of the language
of set theory is to specify a collection V ′ of sets with very special properties and
reinterpret “set” to mean “set in V ′.” Some of these inner models of set theory are
interesting mathematical models in their own right, particularly G¨odel’s universe L of
constructible sets whose properties we considered brieﬂy in Chapter 5. Cohen’s method
of forcing introduces more complicated reinterpretations of the language.
A fascinating thing about the metamathematical method is that it can be used
to establish positive results about the universe V , our intended interpretation of the
language of set theory. We will look at some of these applications of metamathematics,
as we are naturally more interested here in facts about sets rather than theorems about
systems of axioms.
It may be useful to review at this point our intuitive conception of the standard model
for set theory, the universe V of sets. This does not contain all “arbitrary collections of
353

[8
objects”—it is well known that this naive approach leads to contradictions. Instead,
we admit as “sets” only those collections which occur in the complete (transﬁnite)
cumulative sequence of types—the hierarchy obtained by starting with the empty set
and iterating “indeﬁnitely” the “power operation.”
To be more precise, suppose we are given an operation P on sets which assigns to
each set x a collection P(x) of subsets of x
y ∈P(x) =⇒y ⊆x.
(1)
Suppose we are also given a collection S of stages, wellordered by a relation ≤, i.e.,
for æ, ç, î in S,
æ ≤æ,
(æ ≤ç & ç ≤î) =⇒æ ≤î,
(æ ≤ç & ç ≤æ) =⇒æ = ç,
(2)
æ ≤ç
or
ç ≤æ
(3)
if A ⊆S is any collection of stages, A ̸= ∅, then
there is some î ∈A such that for every ç ∈A, î ≤ç.
Call the least stage 0 and for î ∈S, let î + 1 be the next stage—the least stage which
is greater than î. If ë is a stage ̸= 0 and ̸= î + 1 for every î, we call it a limit stage.
For ﬁxed P, S, ≤satisfying (1) – (3) we deﬁne the hierarchy
Vî = Vî(P, S, ≤)
(î ∈S)
by recursion on î ∈S:
V0 = ∅
Vî+1 = Vî ∪P(Vî),
Vë = S
î<ë Vî
if ë is a limit stage.
The collection of sets
V = V (P, S, ≤) = S
î∈S Vî
is the universe generated with P as the power operation, on the stages S. It is very easy
to check that
î ≤ç =⇒Vî ⊆Vç
and that each Vî is a transitive set, i.e.,
(x ∈Vî & y ∈x) =⇒y ∈Vî.
For example, suppose we take
P(x) = Power(x) = {y : y ⊆x}
and
S = {0, 1, 2, . . . , ù, ù + 1, ù + 2, . . . },
where the stages 0, 1, 2, . . . , ù, ù + 1, ù + 2, . . . are all assumed distinct and ordered
as we have enumerated them. In this case we obtain the universe of Zermelo,
V Z = V0 ∪V1 ∪V2 ∪· · · ∪Vù ∪Vù+1 ∪· · · .
It is well known that all the familiar structures of classical mathematics have isomorphic
copies within V Z—we can locate in V Z the integers, the reals, all functions on the
reals to the reals, etc.
For a very diﬀerent universe of sets, we might choose a small power operation, e.g.,
P(x) = {y : y ⊆x and y is deﬁnable}.

8A]
8A. Structures and languages
355
This appears vague, but there are many mathematicians which will argue that the
notion of a deﬁnable subset of x is at least as clear as that of arbitrary subset of x.
In any case, assuming that this operation P is meaningful, we can iterate it on any
collection of stages S and deﬁne a universe of sets. We may want to take S quite long
this time, say
S = {0, 1, 2, , . . . , ù, ù + 1, . . . , ù2, ù2 + 1, . . . , ùn, ùn + 1, . . . , . . . }.
It is clear that the universe V (P, S, ≤) does not depend on the particular objects that
we have chosen to call stages but only on the length (the order type) of the ordering ≤;
i.e., if we have a one-to-one correspondence of S with S′ which takes the ordering ≤
to ≤′, then
V (P, S, ≤) = V (P, S′, ≤′).
Most mathematicians accept that there is a largest meaningful operation P satisfy-
ing (1) above, the true power operation which takes x to the collection of all subsets
of x. This is one of the cardinal assumptions of realistic (meaningful, not formal) set
theory. Similarly, it is not unreasonable to assume that there is a longest collection of
stages S along which we can meaningfully iterate the power operation. We take then
our standard universe of sets to be V (P, S, ≤), where P is the true power operation and
S, ≤is the longest meaningful collection of stages.
This deﬁnition of the universe V is admittedly vague. It is clear that we cannot expect
to give a precise, mathematical deﬁnition of the basic notions of set theory, unless we
use notions of some richer theory which in turn would require interpretation. We
claim only that the intuitive description of V given above is suﬃciently clear so we can
formulate meaningful propositions about sets and argue rationally about their truth
or falsity.
One last remark about the Axiom of Choice.
Although we take it as evident
(throughout this book) that the Axiom of Choice is true (in the standard universe
of sets), it is often useful for technical, metamathematical reasons to keep track ot
its (rare) uses. In this chapter we will include among the hypotheses of our theorems
whichever special case of the the Axiom of Choice we need for the proof.
8A. Structures and languages
Here we will explain brieﬂy the basic notions of logic and model theory. The reader
who is knowledgable in these matters will want to skip through this section very
quickly.
Let us consider ﬁrst some important examples of mathematical “structures.”
Example 1. A1 = (ù, +, ·, 0, 1), the structure of (ﬁrst order) arithmetic.
We think of A1 as an algebraic system with domain ù, two binary relations, + (ad-
dition) and · (multiplication) and two speciﬁed constants, 0 and 1.
Example 2. A2 = (ù, N, +, ·, ap, 0, 1)), the structure of second order arithmetic.
Now we have two domains, ù and N = ùù, the same two binary operations + and ·
deﬁned on ù and again 0 and 1. We also have the binary operation of application
ap : N × ù →ù,
where of course
ap(α, n) = α(n).

356
8. Metamathematics
[8A
Example 3. R = (R, +, ·, 0, 1, ≤, Z), the structure of the real numbers or analysis.
Just one domain this time, the reals R, together with the operation + and ·, the
constants 0 and 1 and the ordering ≤which turns R into a complete ordered ﬁeld. We
also have the distinguished subset Z of rational integers,
Z = {. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . . }
which we take as additional relation on R,
Z(x) ⇐⇒x is a rational integer.
Example 4. V = (V, ∈), the structure of set theory.
Again just one domain, the universe V of sets in the cumulative sequence of types,
together with the membership relation ∈on V ,
x ∈y ⇐⇒x is a member of y.
In this structure, the domain is a collection of objects which is not a set.
In general, a structure is determined by certain domains (collections of objects) and
certain functions, relations and distinguished elements of these domains. Allowing for
the possibility of inﬁnitely many objects in each of these categories, a structure A is
given by
A = ({Ai}i∈I , {fj}j∈J, {Rk}k∈K, {cl}l∈L),
where the following hold.
(1) The index set I is non-empty and each Ai is a non-empty collection of objects.
(2) Each fj is a function
fj : Ai1 × · · · × Aim →An
with domain some cartesian product Ai1 × · · · × Aim and range some An.
(3) Each Rk is a relation
Rk ⊆Ai1 × · · · × Aim
on some cartesian product Ai1 × · · · × Aim.
(4) Each cl is an element of some Ai.
We allow the possibility that some of the index sets J, K, L are empty, so the
simplest possible structure is of the form
A = (A),
with A some non-empty collection. Most of the time we have ﬁnitely many domains,
functions, relations and constants and we exhibit the structures without indexings, as
in the examples.
One can think of many natural structures that come up in mathematics, particularly
in algebra—groups, rings, ﬁelds, etc.
With each structure
A = ({Ai}i∈I , {fj}j∈J, {Rk}k∈K, {cl}l∈L)
we now associate a formal language LA, the ﬁrst order or elementary language of A.
Like a natural language, LA will have an alphabet (a set of symbols) and a grammar,
a system of rules which determine which combinations of symbols in the alphabet are
meaningful. There will be two kinds of meaningful expressions, terms (or nouns) which
will name elements in the domains of A and formulas which will express propositions
about A.

8A]
8A. Structures and languages
357
One diﬀerence between LA and natural languages is that the grammar of LA will
be very simple and completely precise; there will be no exceptions to its rules and no
ambiguities with variant spellings, double meanings, etc.
It will be good to keep in mind while going through the formal details below, that
every object of LA has a natural translation into English—the symbols, the terms and
the formulas. What we are doing is to isolate and make precise a small part of the
natural language in which we can make reasonably complicated assertions about the
structure A.
The alphabet of LA consists of the following (distinct) symbols.
Variables: We have an inﬁnite sequence of variables
vi
0, vi
1, vi
2, . . .
for each domain Ai.
We will use the variables vi
j to name unspeciﬁed objects of Ai. For example, in the
case of arithmetic A1 we have variables v0, v1, v2, . . . over ù and in the case of second
order arithmetic A2 we have variables v0, v1, v2, . . . over ù and α0, α1, α2, . . . over N.
Function symbols: a relation symbol fj for each j ∈J.
Relation symbols: a constant symbol Rk for each k ∈K.
Constant symbols: a function symbol cl for each l ∈L.
Logical symbols: the usual symbols of logic ¬, & , ∃, to be read “not”, “and”, “there
exists”.
Identity: the symbol
=
for equality.
Punctuation marks: the parentheses
( )
and the comma
, .
Before we go on to deﬁne the grammar of LA, we can get an idea of its expressive
power by glancing at its alphabet. We can refer to the functions, relations and constants
of A, we can assert that two objects in some domain Ai are equal, we can say “and”
and “not” or “it is not the case.” More signiﬁcantly, using the variables we can say
“there exists an object in Ai such that . . . ” but we cannot say “there exists a subset of
Ai such that . . . ”, because we have no variables over subsets of the basic domains.
This is why LA is called a ﬁrst order language.
Here are the precise rules of the grammar of LA.
Terms. For each domain Ai there are terms of type Ai which will name objects of
Ai. We deﬁne all these simultaneously by the following recursion.
(1) For each Ai, every variable vi
j over Ai is a term of type Ai.
(2) If the distinguished constant cl belongs to Ai, then the constant symbol cl is a
term of type Ai.
(3) If fj : Ai1 × · · · × Aim →An is one of the functions in A with corresponding
function symbol fj and if t1, . . . , tm are terms of types Ai1, . . . , Aim respectively, then
the ﬁnite sequence
fj(t1, . . . , tm)

358
8. Metamathematics
[8A
is a term of type An. By fj(t1, . . . , tm) we mean the ﬁnite sequence obtained by stringing
along fj, then (, then the sequence t1, then the comma ,, then the sequence t2, etc.
These clauses determine by recursion on the length of a given ﬁnite sequence of
symbols t whether or not t is of type Ai. It is easy to prove by induction on the length
of a given term t that t is a variable or a constant symbol or else t is fj(t1, . . . , tm)
with uniquely determined fj, t1, . . . , tm. Thus we can deﬁne a function F on terms
by specifying outright the values F (t) for prime t (those given by clauses (1) and (2)
above) and then giving instructions for computing F at fj(t1, . . . , tm) in terms of the
value of F at t1, . . . , tm. This process of deﬁnition by recursion on the length of terms is
very useful.
In the case of V = (V, ∈) where we have no functions and no distinguished constants,
the only terms are the variables.
Formulas.
These too are ﬁnite sequences of symbols deﬁned recursively by the
following clauses.
(1) If Rk ⊆Ai1 ×· · ·×Aim is a relation on A with corresponding relation symbol Rk
and if t1, . . . , tm are terms of types Ai1, . . . , Aim respectively, then the ﬁnite sequence
Rk(t1, . . . , tm)
is a formula.
(2) If t and s are terms of the same type, then
t = s
is a formula.
(3) If ϕ is a formula, then ¬(ϕ) is also a formula.
(4) If ϕ and ø are formulas, then (ϕ) & (ø) is also a formula.
(5) If ϕ is a formula, then for each variable vi
j, (∃vi
j)(ϕ) is also a formula.
Again, one can show by induction on the length of a given formula ÷, that ÷ is of
exactly one of the forms
Rk(t1, . . . , tm),
t = s,
¬(ϕ),
(ϕ) & (ø),
(∃vi
j)(ϕ)
with uniquely determined Rk, t1, . . . , tm, t, s, ϕ, ø, vi
j, see 8A.2. This justiﬁes deﬁnition
by recursion on the length of formulas, where we deﬁne F (÷) by specifying the values
outright for ÷ prime (given by clauses (1) or (2) above) and then deﬁning F at ¬(ϕ),
(ϕ) & (ø), (∃vi
j)(ϕ) in terms of the values of F at ϕ and ø.
The natural interpretation of the terms and formulas of LA in A is completely
obvious from the way in which we read the formal symbols. Notice that some formulas
express propositions which are outright true or false, e.g., (∃vi
0)(vi
0 = vi
0) asserts the
existence of some object in Ai which is equal to itself which is obviously true, since we
are assuming Ai ̸= ∅. Other formulas impose conditions on unspeciﬁed members in
the domains of A named by the variables, e.g., Rk(vi
0) is true just in case the relation
Rk holds at the object of Ai we are (for the moment) calling vi
0. Similarly, some terms
name speciﬁc objects, e.g., fj(cl, cl ′) names fj(cl, cl ′), while the value of others (like
fj(vi
0, cl) depends on our interpretation of the variables.
An assignment of values to the variables is a function
x = {xi
j : i ∈I, j = 0, 1, 2, . . . }

8A]
8A. Structures and languages
359
which assigns to each domain Ai and each variable vi
j over Ai a member xi
j of Ai.
With each assignment x and each term t we associate the value tA[x] = t[x] of t at x
by the obvious recursion
vi
j[x] = xi
j,
(1)
cl[x] = cl,
(2)
fj(t1, . . . , tm)[x] = fj(t1[x], . . . , tm[x]).
(3)
Clearly, t[x] ∈Ai, if t is a term of type Ai.
If x = {xi
j : i ∈I, j ∈ù} is an assignment and ÷ is a formula of LA, let us say
x satisﬁes ÷ in A
and write
A, x |= ÷
if ÷ is true when we interpret each vi
j by xi
j. This relation of satisfaction between
structures, assignments and formulas has the following properties:
A, x |= Rk(t1, . . . , tm) ⇐⇒Rk(t1[x], . . . , tm[x]),
(1)
A, x |= t = s ⇐⇒t[x] = s[x],
(2)
A, x |= ¬(ϕ) ⇐⇒it is not the case that A, x |= ϕ,
(3)
A, x |= (ϕ) & (ø) ⇐⇒A, x |= ϕ and A, x |= ø,
(4)
A, x |= (∃vi
j)(ϕ) ⇐⇒there exists some assignment
y = {yk
n : k ∈I, n ∈ù} such that
A, y |= ϕ and if k ̸= i or n ̸= j, then
yk
n = xk
n .
(5)
These equivalences (the Tarski conditions) codify the natural translation of the formal
language LA into English—only (5) needs a bit of reﬂection to verify this. Alterna-
tively, we may construe (1)–(5) as a precise deﬁnition of satisfaction by recursion on
the length of formulas which does not appeal directly to the meaning of the formulas
of LA.
The truth or falsity of (∃v0
1)Rk(v0
1) does not depend on our interpretation of the
variable v0
1—it is true or false accordingly as there exists or not some x0
1 in A0 such
that Rk(x0
1) holds. On the other hand, whether x satisﬁes Rk(v0
1) depends on what x0
1
is. To make this important distinction precise, we associate with each term t and each
formula ÷ the set FV(t) or FV(÷) of free variables of t or ÷ by the following recursion:
FV(vi
j) = {vi
j},
(1)
FV(cl) = ∅,
(2)
FV
 fj(t1, . . . , tm)

= FV(t1) ∪· · · ∪FV(tm),
(3)
FV
 Rk(t1, . . . , tm)

= FV(t1) ∪· · · ∪FV(tm),
(1)
FV(t = s) = FV(t) ∪FV(s),
(2)
FV
 ¬(ϕ)

= FV(ϕ),
(3)
FV
 (ϕ) & (ø)

= FV(ϕ) ∪FV(ø),
(4)
FV
 (∃vi
j)(ϕ)

= FV(ϕ) \ {vi
j}.
(5)
Clearly, FV(t), FV(÷) is a ﬁnite set of variables for each t and each ÷.

360
8. Metamathematics
[8A
It is clear that the free variables of a term t (the members of FV(t)) are exactly all
the variables which actually occur in t. On the other hand, a variable vi
j is free in some
formula ÷ only if vi
j occurs someplace in ÷ not within the scope of a quantiﬁer ∃vi
j,
because of the last clause in the deﬁnition of FV(÷).
It is also clear that to compute the values t[x] we need only know xi
j for i, j such
that vi
j is free in t. Similarly, whether A, x |= ÷ holds or not depends only on the
values xi
j for vi
j free in ÷. This is made precise in the following proposition which can
be proved by a simple induction on the length of terms and formulas (see 8A.2): if
x = {xi
j : i ∈I, j ∈ù}, y = {yi
j : i ∈I, j ∈ù} are assignments in A and xi
j = yi
j
whenever vi
j is free in a formula ÷, then
A, x |= ÷ ⇐⇒A, y |= ÷.
Formulas with no free variables are called sentences. These are obviously satisﬁed
by some assignment if and only if they are satisﬁed by all assignments, so if ϕ is a
sentence, we put
A |= ϕ ⇐⇒for some x, A, x |= ϕ
⇐⇒for all x, A, x |= ϕ.
We say that ϕ is true in A, if A |= ϕ, otherwise ϕ is false in A.
We did not include in the vocabulary of LA a special symbol ∀to express “for all.”
However, in the intended interpretation of the symbols, if ϕ is a formula, then clearly
(∀vi
j)(ϕ) ⇐⇒¬((∃vi
j)(¬(ϕ))).
We will consider the expression (∀vi
j)(ϕ) (which is not a formula, strictly speaking) as
an abbreviation of the formula ¬((∃vi
j)(¬(ϕ))). Here are three additional very useful
abbreviations:
(ϕ) ∨(ø) ⇐⇒¬((¬(ϕ)) & (¬(ø)))
(read ϕ or ø),
(ϕ) →(ø) ⇐⇒(¬(ϕ)) ∨(ø)
(read ϕ implies ø),
(ϕ) ↔(ø) ⇐⇒(ϕ) →(ø) & (ø) →(ϕ)
(read ϕ if and only if ø).
In addition to using these simple abbreviations we will also be very sloppy in spelling
correctly the formulas of LA. We will freely omit parentheses when it is obvious where
they should be inserted, we will use brackets [, ] or {, } instead of parentheses when
they improve readability and we will use variables k, n, m, x, y, z, α, â, ã
e
, . . . etc.
instead of the doubly subscripted formula vi
j to bring the formal language closer to
our informal mathematical notation. If certain functions or relations have customary
notations in some familiar structures, we will use these rather than formal functions
and relation symbols. For example, in the case of second order arithmetic we will
write
α(n)
instead of
ap(v1
0, v0
0),
in the case of analysis we will write
x + y ≤z
instead of something like
≤(+(v0, v1), v2),
and in the case of set theory we will certainly write
x ∈y
instead of
∈(v0, v1).

8A.2]
8A. Structures and languages
361
In fact, only rarely will we put down a correct formula of a formal language LA. The
usual practice will be to write fairly simple expressions in “symbolized English” which
can be translated into correct formulas of LA (in principle at least) by any competent
student. To give one more example of this, the expression
(∃x)(∀y)[y /∈x]
clearly asserts the existence of the empty set in the language of set theory. It is a
misspelling of the horrendous
(∃v0
1)(¬((∃v0
2)(¬(¬(∈(v0
2, v0
1)))))).
In the exercises of this section we will outline the proofs of a few useful results from
model theory, the study of structures and their languages. Particularly signiﬁcant (for
us) are the Skolem-L¨owenheim Theorem, 8A.4, and the computation of the satisfaction
relation for countable structures, 8A.6.
Exercises
8A.1. Prove that every formula ÷ in the language LA of a structure

Hint. Use induction on the length of ÷. Show ﬁrst that the number of left paren-
theses ( in a formula ÷ is equal to the number of right parentheses ) in ÷ and that if ó
is an initial segment of ÷ (thought of as a sequence of symbols), then the number of
left parentheses in ó is greater than or equal to the number of right parentheses in ó.⊣

Hint. Show ﬁrst by induction on the length of terms that if xi

After these preliminary trivial facts, we turn to some simple but important model-
theoretic results. To simplify matters, let us restrict ourselves to structures with one
domain, ﬁnitely many relations and no functions or distinguished elements,
A = (A, R1, . . . , RK).
The characteristic or similarity type of such a structure is the sequence code which
describes the number and arity of the relations R1, . . . , RK,
u = ch(A) = ⟨n1, . . . , nK⟩,
where for i = 1, . . . , K, Ri ⊆Ani . For example, the characteristic of the structure
V = (V, ∈) of set theory is given by
ch(V) = ⟨2⟩= 22+1 = 8.

362
8. Metamathematics
[8A.3
It is clear that the language LA of a structure A = (A, R1, . . . , RK) is completely
determined by the characteristic u = ch(A), since all we need to deﬁne LA is to choose
an ni-ary relation symbol Ri for i = 1, . . . , K. Fix once and for all a language Lu for
each characteristic u; now the formulas of Lu can be interpreted in every structure of
characteristic u.
Consider ﬁrst the very simple notion of isomorphic structures. Suppose that A =
(A, R1, . . . , RK), B = (B, P1, . . . , PK) have the same characteristic u = ⟨n1, . . . , nK⟩.
An isomorphism of A with B is any bijection
ð : A ֌
→B
such that for all x1, . . . , xni ∈A (i = 1, . . . , K),

→B is an isomorphism of A = (A, R1, . . . , RK) with
B = (B, P1, . . . , PK), both structures of the same characteristic u. Prove that for every
formula ϕ of the common language Lu and every assignment x = {xj : j = 0, 1, . . . }
into A,
A, x0, x1, x2, . . . |= ϕ ⇐⇒B, ð(x0), ð(x1), ð(x2), . . . |= ϕ.
Infer that A and B satisfy the same sentences of Lu.
Hint. Use induction on the length of formulas.
⊣
Structures of the same characteristic u which satisfy the same sentences of Lu are
called elementarily equivalent; thus 8A.3 asserts (in part) that isomorphic structures
are elementarily equivalent.
Suppose again that A = (A, R1, . . . , RK) and B = (B, P1, . . . , PK) are structures of
the same characteristic. We say that A is a substructure of B and write
A ⊆B
if A ⊆B and every Ri is the restriction of the corresponding Pi to A, i.e.,
x1, . . . , xni ∈A =⇒[Ri(x1, . . . , xni) ⇐⇒Pi(x1, . . . , xni)].
We say that A is an elementary substructure of B and write
A ⪯B
if A ⊆B and for every formula ϕ of the common language Lu and every assignment
x = {xj : j = 0, 1, . . . } into A,
A, x |= ϕ ⇐⇒B, x |= ϕ.
It is immediate that if A ⪯B, then A and B are elementarily equivalent.
8A.4 (The Skolem-L¨owenheim Theorem). Suppose B = (B, P1, . . . , PK) is a struc-
ture of characteristic u = ⟨n1, . . . , nK⟩whose universe B is an inﬁnite set which admits
a wellordering, and let A ⊆B be any subset of B. Prove that there exists an elementary
substructure of B
A∗= (A∗, R1, . . . , RK) ⪯B
where A ⊆A∗and
card(A∗) = card(A) + ℵ0;
in particular, if A is inﬁnite, then card(A∗) = card(A).
Infer that every inﬁnite,
wellorderable structure has a countable elementary substructure.

8A. Structures and languages

Hint. Suppose C = (C, R1, . . . , RK) ⊆B is a substructure of B and ϕ is a formula
of Lu. We say that ϕ is absolute for C if for every assignment x = {xj : j = 0, 1, . . . }
into C,
C, x |= ϕ ⇐⇒B, x |= ϕ.
Thus C is an elementary substructure of B if every formula of Lu is absolute for C.
The key notion of the proof is that of a Skolem set (of functions) for a formula. If S
is a set of functions on B to B (of any number of variables) and C = (C, R1, . . . , RK)
is a substructure of B, we say that C is closed under S if for every n-ary f : Bn →B
in S,
x1, . . . , xn ∈C =⇒f(x1, . . . , xn) ∈C.
A set of functions S is a Skolem set for a formula ϕ if ϕ is absolute for every substructure
of B which is closed under S.
Show by induction on the length of formulas that every formula ÷ has a ﬁnite Skolem
set S(÷). This is the heart of the proof. The most interesting case is when ÷ is (∃vj)(ϕ),
where (say) the free variables of ϕ are among v0, v1, . . . , vm and (for simplicity) assume
that j = m. Here we can take
S(÷) = S(ϕ) ∪{f}
where f : Bm →B has the property that for all x0, . . . , xm−1 ∈B,
there exists some xm such that B, x0, . . . , xm−1, xm |= ϕ
=⇒B, x0, . . . , xm−1, f(x0, . . . , xm−1) |= ϕ
where we have put down only the part of an assignment which is relevant to the
satisfaction of ϕ. (We need a wellordering of B or the Axiom of Choice, to deﬁne f.)
Since there are only countably many formulas, the union
S = S
ϕ S(ϕ)
is a countable set and it is obviously a Skolem set for every formula of Lu. Use a simple
set-theoretic argument to construct some A∗⊆B such that A ⊆A∗, A∗is closed under
S and card(A∗) = card(A) + ℵ0. The required structure is A∗= (A∗, R1, . . . , RK),
where each Ri is the restriction of Pi to A∗.
⊣
The Skolem-L¨owenheim Theorem tells us in particular that there are many inter-
esting countable structures.
In the remaining exercises of this section we will compute the complexity of the
satisfaction relation on countable structures, coded by irrationals.
For each characteristic u = ⟨n1, . . . , nk⟩and each irrational α, deﬁne the structure
A(u, α) = (A, R1, . . . , RK)
by
A = {n ∈ù : (α)0(n) = 1},
Ri(x1, . . . , xni ) ⇐⇒x1, . . . , xni ∈A & (α)i(⟨x1, . . . , xni ⟩) = 1.
Of course, in order for α to code a structure, the set A must be non-empty, i.e.,
(∃n)[(α)0(n) = 1].

8. Metamathematics
[8A.5
We assign a code [÷]u ∈ù to each formula of Lu by the following recursion on the
length of formulas
[Ri(vj1, . . . , vjni )]u = ⟨0, i, j1, . . . , jni⟩,
(1 ≤i ≤K)
[vj1 = vj2]u = ⟨0, 0, j1, j2⟩,
[¬(ϕ)]u = ⟨1, [ϕ]u⟩,
[(ϕ) & (ø)]u = ⟨2, [ϕ]u, [ø]u⟩,
[(∃vj)(ϕ)]u = ⟨3, j, [ϕ]u⟩.
If m is the code of a formula ÷, i.e., [÷]u = m, we put
÷ = ÷m.
The next exercise is routine by the methods of Chapter 3.
8A.5. Prove that the following relations on ù are semirecursive:
Char(u) ⇐⇒u is the characteristic of some structure
A = (A, R1, . . . , RK),
Str(u, α) ⇐⇒Char(u) & [α codes a structure of characteristic u]
⇐⇒Char(u) & (∃n)[(α)0(n) = 1],
Fmla(u, m) ⇐⇒Char(u) &

m = [÷]u for some formula ÷ of Lu
,
Free(u, m, j) ⇐⇒Fmla(u, m) & [vj is free in ÷m],
Assgn(u, α, m, x) ⇐⇒Str(u, α) & Fmla(u, m)
& (∀j)

Free(u, m, j) =⇒(α)0
 (x)j

= 1

The last assertion holds if the mapping j 7→(x)j is an assignment to the domain of
the structure A(u, α), at least as far as the free variables of ÷m are concerned.
Put
Sat(u, α, m, x) ⇐⇒Assgn(u, α, m, x) & A(u, α), x |= ÷m,
where x = {(x)j : j = 0, 1, . . . }. This is the coding of the satisfaction relation. We
will have many occasions to use the basic computational estimate in the next exercise.
8A.6. Prove that the relation Sat is ∆1
1.
Hint. Put
P(u, α, â) ⇐⇒(∀m)(∀x)[Sat(u, α, m, x) ⇐⇒â(⟨m, x⟩) = 1]
and notice that
Sat(u, α, m, x) ⇐⇒Assgn(u, α, m, x) & (∃â)[P(u, α, â) & â(⟨m, x⟩) = 1]
⇐⇒Assgn(u, α, m, x) & (∀â)[P(u, α, â) =⇒â(⟨m, x⟩) = 1],
so that it suﬃces to prove that P is arithmetical. This is easy to verify using 8A.5,
the recursive deﬁnition of the codings above and the satisfaction relation: in order to
have P(u, α, â), â(⟨m, x⟩) must give the correct value when m codes a prime formula
and for more complicated formulas the correct value of â(⟨m, x⟩) can be computed in
terms of â(⟨s, y⟩) for codes s of shorter formulas.

8B. Elementary deﬁnability
365
It is clear that the results in 8A.4–8A.6 can be extended easily to structures of the
form
A = (A1, . . . , AI , f1, . . . , fJ, R1, . . . , RK, C1, . . . , CL)
with ﬁnitely many domains, functions, relations and constants. The computations are
a bit messier.
8B. Elementary deﬁnability
Let us introduce a very useful notational convention: if the free variable of a formula
are among x1, . . . , xn, we will use a symbol like
ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
to name that formula. For example, we might denote the formula
(R(vi
0)) & ((∃v2
1)(v2
1 = vi
0))
by the symbols
ϕ(vi
0)
or
ø(vi
0, v3
1)
or any ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) where x1, . . . , xn are variables and one of them is vi
0, the only free
variable of the formula above.
This is similar to the algebraic practice of referring to a polynomial f(x, y, z) in
three indeterminates over some ring, where f(x, y, z) might be x · y or x · z + x or
x + y + z.
As in algebra, the advantage of this convention is that it allows a very compact
notation for the operation of evaluation. If ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) is a formula (whose free
variables are among x1, . . . , xn) and x1, . . . , xn are members of the domain of A, with
xi in Ai whenever xi is of type Ai, put
A |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒there is some assignment x which assigns xi to xi,
i = 1, . . . , n and A, x |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
⇐⇒for every assignment x which assigns xi to xi,
A, x |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn).
For example, if Ri is one of the basic n-ary relations of a structure A denoted by the
formal symbol Ri, then for x1, . . . , xn in the appropriate domains of A,
Ri(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒A |= Ri(x1, . . . , xn).
Here we are applying the convention above to the formula Ri(x1, . . . , xn), where
x1, . . . , xn are any n distinct variables of the proper types.
Similarly, if ϕ(x1, . . . , xn), ø(x1, . . . , xn) are formulas of some language and we
abbreviate their conjunction by ÷(x1, . . . , xn) in some context,
÷(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) & ø(x1, . . . , xn),
then for x1, . . . , xn in the appropriate domains of a structure A,
A |= ÷(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒A |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) & ø(x1, . . . , xn)
⇐⇒A |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) and A |= ø(x1, . . . , xn).
According to this convention, from now on we reserve the symbols ϕ, ÷, ø etc. for
sentences, i.e., formulas without free variables.

8. Metamathematics
[8B.1
We now come to the basic notion of ﬁrst order or elementary deﬁnability in a
language.
Let
A = ({Ai}i∈I , {fj}j∈J, {Rk}k∈K, {cl}l∈L)
be a structure with associated language LA. A relation
R ⊆Ai1 × · · · × Ain
is ﬁrst order deﬁnable or elementary in A (or LA) if there is a formula ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) of
LA where each xj is a variable of type Aij and
R(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒A |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn);
(1)
a subset
B ⊆Ai
of one of the domains of A is elementary, if there is a formula ϕ(x) of LA, with just
one free variable such that
x ∈B ⇐⇒A |= ϕ(x);
(2)
a function
F : Ai1 × · · · × Ain →Aj
is elementary if for some ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, y),
F (x1, . . . , xn) = y ⇐⇒A |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, y);
(3)
ﬁnally a member a of some Ai is elementary if for some ϕ(x),
x = a ⇐⇒A |= ϕ(x).
(4)
We will say that a formula which satisﬁes (1), (2), (3) or (4) deﬁnes R, B, F or a
respectively in the structure A.
Let us collect in a simple result the basic properties of these notions.
8B.1. Theorem. (i) The collection of elementary relations in a structure A contains
all the relations Rk of A and = and is closed under ¬, & , ∨, ∃Ai and ∀Ai for each i ∈I
as well as substitution of elementary functions.
(ii) A set B ⊆Ai is elementary in a structure A, if and only if its representing relation
RB(x) ⇐⇒x ∈B
is elementary in A.
(iii) The collection of elementary functions in a structure A contains all the functions
fj of A, the projection functions
(x1, . . . , xn) 7→xj
and the constants
(x1, . . . , xn) 7→cl,
where cl is a distinguished element of A; this collection is closed under addition and
permutation of variables, deﬁnition by cases (determined by elementary conditions) and
composition.
(iv) An element a ∈Ai is elementary in a structure A is and only if every constant
function
(x1, . . . , xn) 7→a
is elementary in A.

8B.8]
8B. Elementary deﬁnability
367
Proof is trivial.
⊣
It is clear that a relation, function or element is elementary in A if we can put down
a deﬁnition for it in the small part of English which is formalized in LA.
There are four main results which exhibit the connection between elementary deﬁn-
ability and the analytical pointclasses. We will state them here and outline their proofs
in the exercises.
Recall that a pointsets of type 0 is any R ⊆ùk and a pointset of type 1 is any
R ⊆X1 × · · · × Xk with each Xi = ù or N and some Xj = N.
8B.2. Theorem. A pointset of type 0 is arithmetical if and only if R is elementary in
the structure of arithmetic A1 = (ù, +, ·, 0, 1).
8B.3. Theorem. A pointset R of type 0 or 1 is analytical if and only if R is elementary
in the structure of second order number theory A2 = (ù, N, +, ·, ap, 0, 1).
8B.4. Theorem. Any n-ary relation on the real numbers R ⊆Rn is analytical if and
only if R is elementary in the structure of analysis R = (R, +, ·, 0, 1, ≤, Z).
Sometimes we can obtain ﬁner results if we restrict attention to deﬁnability by
formulas with special properties.
8B.5. Theorem. A pointset R of type 0 or 1 is arithmetical if and only if R is deﬁnable
in the structure of second order arithmetic A2 = (ù, N, +, ·, ap, 0, 1) by some formula
ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) which has no quantiﬁers over N.
If we use variables v0, v1, v2, . . . over ù and α0, α1, α2, . . . over N in the language
of A2, this means that no part of ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) in 8A.4 looks like (∃αj).
In addition to the proofs of these results, we will also formulate in the exercises sev-
eral more characterizations of various pointclasses in terms of elementary deﬁnability.
Exercises
8B.6. Prove that every relation on ù which is elementary in the structure A1 of
arithmetic is arithmetical.
Hint. Show by induction on the length of a formula ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) that the corre-
sponding relation
R(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒A1 |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
is arithmetical. It will help to notice ﬁrst that if the free variables of a term t are among
x1, . . . , xm and f : ùm →ù is deﬁned by
f(x1, . . . , xm) = t[x1, . . . , xm],
then f is recursive.

The same method also establishes with no problem the easy directions of 8B.2–8B.4.
8B.7. Prove that if a pointset R is elementary in the structure A2 of second order
arithmetic, then R is analytical.

Prove of the converse implications in 8B.6–8B.9 is a bit more interesting. We break
it down in several steps.

exists some s and some t such that
â(s, t, 0) = w0, â(s, t, 1) = w1, . . . , â(s, t, n −1) = wn−1.
Hint. That â is elementary on A1 is easy. To prove that it has the required prop-
erty, notice that if d0, d1, . . . , dn−1 is an n-tuple of relatively prime numbers, then the
function
s 7→
 rm(s, d0), rm(s, d1), . . . rm(s, dn−1)

from {s : s < d0 · d1 · · · · · dn−1}
into {(w0, . . . , wn−1) : w0 < d0 & w1 < d1 & · · · & wn−1 < dn−1};
this is an easy divisibility argument. Since these two sets have the same ﬁnite car-
dinality, it follows that for relatively prime d0, d1, . . . , dn−1 and every w0 < d0, w1 <
d1, . . . , wn−1 < dn−1 there exists some s < d0 · d1 · · · · · dn−1 with
w0 = rm(s, d0), w1 = rm(s, d1), . . . , wn−1 = rm(s, dn−1)
(the Chinese Remainder Theorem). Now given w0, w1, . . . , wn−1, let
m = max(w0, w1, . . . , wn−1, n)
and take t = m!. Another easy divisibility argument shows that the numbers
d0 = 1 + t, d1 = 1 + 2t, . . . , dn−1 = 1 + nt
are relatively prime, hence by the Chinese remainder theorem there is some s such

Hint. By 8B.6 and 8B.1, it is enough to prove that every recursive relation on ù is

8B.13. Prove Theorem 8B.4, that a pointset R ⊆Rn is analytical if and only if it is

It is clear that for values of the variables in ù, the translation of ÷(x1, . . . , xn) has the
same truth value as ÷(x1, . . . , xn).
Use 8B.11 to prove that every recursive relation on ù is elementary in R and then
use 3C.5 to show easily that every arithmetical R ⊆Rn is elementary in R.
To prove that analytical pointsets are elementary in R we must reduce quantiﬁcation
over N to quantiﬁcation over R. Let f : R ։ N be the surjection deﬁned in the proof
of 3E.11 (with X = R) and show that the relation

There is an obvious way to enrich the languages of the structures we have been

associated with the universe of sets. For simplicity in notation, we will denote the
languages of these structures by “L∈” and “L∈” respectively—in the terminology
of 8A, L∈is the language of characteristic ⟨2⟩= 8.
To avoid confusion with the ordinary functions of mathematics which are usually
taken to be members of V (sets of ordered pairs), we will call functions
F : V n →V
on sets to sets, operations—e.g., the power operation assigns to each x its powerset
{u : u ⊆x}; and we will call relations
R ⊆V n
on the universe of sets conditions, e.g., ∈is a binary condition.
In the ﬁrst result here we compile a list of conditions and operations on sets which
are deﬁnable in L∈. The proof of 8C.1 is trivial, but it will be useful to have this
catalogue of deﬁnitions and equivalences for future reference. We will use the common
abbreviations,
(∃x ∈z)R(x, y1, . . . , yl) ⇐⇒(∃x)[x ∈z & R(x, y1, . . . , yl)],
(∀x ∈z)R(x, y1, . . . , yl) ⇐⇒(∀x)[x ∈z =⇒R(x, y1, . . . , yl)].

.
In particular, Baire space is a deﬁnable set, N = ùù.
We could go on and give formal deﬁnitions in L∈of the rationals, the reals and
all the familiar mathematical objects we have been studying. As usual, we take these
to be sets—objects in V —constructed successively, starting with the set ù of integers
and using operations which are easily deﬁnable in L∈. There is no point in doing this
in detail, as it should be obvious by now that all reasonable sets and conditions and
operations on sets are deﬁnable in L∈.
By the same token, all ordinary mathematical assertions about sets are expressible
by sentences of L∈and in particular, the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory
can be so expressed. We list them here for reference, indicating brieﬂy (with some
“symbolized English”) how each can be expressed in L∈.
There are seven basic axioms in ZF, but we need inﬁnitely many sentences of L∈to
express the ﬁfth and most signiﬁcant of these, the Axiom of Replacement. We take up
ﬁrst the simpler axioms 1–4, 6, and 7.
Axiom 1 (Extensionality). Two sets are equal if they have the same members,
(∀x)(∀y)

(∀t)[t ∈x ⇐⇒t ∈y] =⇒x = y

.
In a simpler form, skipping the trivial initial quantiﬁers,
(∀t)[t ∈x ⇐⇒t ∈y] =⇒x = y.
We will also omit the initial quantiﬁers in our abbreviations of the remaining axioms.
Axiom 2 (Pairing). If x, y are sets, so is the unordered pair {x, y},
(∃z)(∀t)

t ∈z ⇐⇒[t = x ∨t = y]

.
Axiom 3 (Union). For each set x, the union
S x = {t : for some s ∈x, t ∈s}
is also a set,
(∃z)(∀t)

t ∈z ⇐⇒(∃s)[t ∈s & s ∈x]

.
Axiom 4 (Power). For each set x, the power set {t : t ⊆x} is also a set,
(∃z)(∀t)[t ∈z ⇐⇒t ⊆x].
Axiom 5 (Inﬁnity). There exists a set z, such that ∅∈z and for every x, if x ∈z,
then x ∪{x} ∈z;
(∃z){∅∈z & (∀x)[x ∈z =⇒x ∪{x} ∈z]}.
Axiom 6 (Foundation or Regularity). The membership condition is wellfounded, i.e.,
every non-empty set has an ∈-minimal member;
x ̸= ∅=⇒(∃y)

y ∈x & (∀t ∈y)[t /∈x]

.
Consider now the classical Axiom of Replacement.

374
8. Metamathematics
[8C.1
Axiom 7 (Replacement). For each set x and for each operation
F : V →V
which is deﬁnable in L∈, the image
F [x] = {F (t) : t ∈x}
is also a set.
We cannot express this directly in L∈, because it is not possible in this simple
language to quantify over all operations deﬁnable in L∈. Instead, we must assert
separately for each formula of L∈, that it deﬁnes a set operation (in terms of given
parameters), then the image of any set by that operation is also a set. Using the
abbreviation
(∃!t)ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, t) ⇐⇒(∃y)(∀t)[ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, t) ⇐⇒t = y],
we then take as Axiom 7 the collection of all sentences of the form
(∀y1) · · · (∀yn)(∀x)

(∀s)(∃!t)ø(y1, . . . , yn, s, t)
→(∃z)(∀t)

t ∈z ↔(∃s)[s ∈x & ø(y1, . . . , yn, s, t)]
	
,
one for each formula ø(y1, . . . , yn, s, t) of L∈.
Since it takes inﬁnitely many sentences of L∈to express Axiom 7, we often talk of
the Axiom Scheme of Replacement.
From now on, by ZF we will mean this inﬁnite list of sentences of L∈which express
the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. It is very important that ZF is an inﬁnite
set of sentences. The ﬁnite subsets of ZF determine axiomatic set theories which
approximate Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory—the more axioms we have, the better the
approximation.
The theory of Zermelo-Fraenkel with choice ZFC is obtained by adding to ZF the
Axiom of Choice (AC). For every set of pairs P ⊆A × B,
(∀x ∈A)(∃y ∈B)P(x, y) =⇒(∃f : A →B)(∀x ∈A)P(x, f(x)).
This is, of course, equivalent in ZF to a large number of propositions, all of them
easily expressible by sentences of L∈.
According to usual mathematical practice, when we prove a theorem about sets, we
customarily assume without explicit mention that the structure V = (V, ∈) satisﬁes all the
axioms of ZFC, but we are careful to list among the hypotheses of our theorems any
additional assumptions about sets—like the continuum hypothesis or determinacy
hypotheses. We have followed this practice scrupulously in this book. In fact, we
identiﬁed in 7F all blatant uses of the Axiom of Choice which cannot be justiﬁed
on the basis of the weaker Axiom of Dependent Choices, and in this chapter we are
including whatever choice principles we need among the hypotheses of the theorems.
Since we have been emphasizing the fact that all “ordinary mathematical assertions”
about sets can be expressed by sentences of L∈, it is perhaps worth pointing out that in
metamathematics we often consider assertions about sets which are not immediately
or naturally expressible in L∈—or which may not be expressible in L∈at all. For
example, Theorem 8C.1 is not easy to translate into L∈because it refers to conditions
and operations on V while L∈can only speak directly about members of V . Sometimes
we will seek indirect ways of expressing the meaning of a certain proposition by a
sentence of L∈because this will be important in an argument but of course most of

the time we do not care whether or not our theorems are stated in the small part of
English formalized in L∈.
We now return to our study of elementary deﬁnability in the structure V.
It is useful to call a collection of sets
M ⊆V
a class ifmembership in M is deﬁnable in L∈, i.e., ifthere is some formula ϕ(s, x1, . . . , xn)
of L∈and sets x1, . . . , xn ∈V such that
s ∈M ⇐⇒V |= ϕ(s, x1, . . . , xn).
If we can ﬁnd a formula ϕ(s) in L∈(without parameters) so that
s ∈M ⇐⇒V |= ϕ(s),
we then call M a deﬁnable class. For example, the class of ordinals
ON = {î : Ordinal(î)}
is deﬁnable.
If M1, . . . , Mn are classes, then an operation
F : M1 × · · · × Mn →V
is any n-ary operation on sets such that
x1 /∈M1 ∨· · · ∨xn /∈Mn =⇒F (x1, . . . , xn) = 0.
Such an operation is then determined by its values F (x1, . . . , xn) for arguments x1 ∈
M1, . . . , xn ∈Mn.
8C.2. Theorem (Recursion on the ordinals). Let G : V n+1 →V be an operation of
(n + 1) arguments which is deﬁnable in L∈. There exists a unique operation
F : ON × V n →V
which is also deﬁnable in L∈and which satisﬁes the following equation for each ordinal
î and all x1, . . . , xn ∈V :
F (î, x1, . . . , xn) = G
 {⟨⟨ç, F (ç, x1, . . . , xn)⟩⟩: ç < î}, x1, . . . , xn

.
Proof. Put
P(h, x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒Function(h) &

and notice that by 8C.1 and 8B.1, P is deﬁnable in L∈. An easy induction on the
ordinals shows that
P(h, x1, . . . , xn) & P(h′, x1, . . . , xn)
& î ∈Domain(h) ∩Domain(h′) =⇒h(î) = h′(î),
so put
F (î, x1, . . . , xn) =

To complete the proof, it is enough to show that for each x1, . . . , xn,
(∀î)(∃h)[P(h, x1, . . . , xn) & î ∈Domain(h)].
(∗)
Assuming that (∗) fails for some î, let ë be the least ordinal î such that
(∀h)P(h, x1, . . . , xn) =⇒î /∈Domain(h),
and deﬁne
H(î) =
(
⟨⟨î, F (î, x1, . . . , xn)⟩⟩
if î < ë,
∅
if ë ≤î;
now H is deﬁnable in L∈, so by the Replacement Axiom, the image
h = H[ë] = {⟨⟨î, F (î, x1, . . . , xn)⟩⟩: î < ë}
is a set and hence
h′ = h ∪{⟨⟨ë, G(h, x1, . . . , xn)⟩⟩}
is also a set. But easily
P(h′, x1, . . . , xn) & ë ∈Domain(h′),
contradicting the choice of ë.
⊣
We allow n = 0 in this theorem, in which case
G : V →V
deﬁnes uniquely an operation F : ON →V which satisﬁes
F (î) = G(F ↾î).
Using this basic result we can deﬁne the transﬁnite sequence {Vî : î ∈ON} of
partial universes (cumulative types) by the recursion
V0 = ∅
Vî+1 = Power(Vî),
Vë = S
î<ë Vî, if ë is a limit ordinal
(see 8C.8). It is easy to verify (by induction on î) that each Vî is a transitive set,
V0 ⫋· · · ⫋Vî ⫋Vî+1 ⫋· · · ,
V = S
î Vî,
and
î ∈Vî+1 \ Vî.
This hierarchy of partial universes gives a precise version of the intuitive construction
for the universe of sets which we discussed in the introduction to this chapter, where
for stages we take the ordinals. It also suggests drawing the universe V in the form of
an inverted cone, growing upwards, with the ordinals plotted along the main axis, see
Figure 8C.1.
Recall that we are taking cardinals to be initial ordinals,
Cardinal(κ) ⇐⇒Ordinal(κ)
& (∀î ∈κ)(∀f){[Function(f) & Domain(f) = î]
=⇒(∃ç ∈κ)[ç /∈Image(f)]}.
The condition Cardinal(κ) is clearly deﬁnable in L∈.

The familiar indexing of cardinals by ordinals is also deﬁned by recursion,
ℵ0 = ù,
ℵî+1 = ℵ+
î = least ordinal κ > ℵî,
ℵë = supremum{ℵî : î < ë}, if ë is a limit ordinal.
Intuitively, one would think that when î is a “typical” very large ordinal, then the
partial universe Vî should “look very much like” the completed universe of sets V .
We next prove a very important precise version of this idea.
First a lemma about closed, unbounded classes of ordinals.
A class K of ordinals is unbounded if
(∀î)(∃ç > î)[ç ∈K];
K is closed if for every limit ordinal î,
(∀ç < î)(∃æ)[ç < æ < î & æ ∈K] =⇒î ∈K,
i.e., if K is closed in the natural order topology on ON.
8C.3. Lemma. (i) If K1 and K2 are closed, unbounded classes of ordinals, then K1∩K2
is also closed and unbounded.
(ii) If
F : ON →ON
is an operation on ordinals which is deﬁnable in L∈, then the class
K∗= {î : (∀ç < î)[F (ç) < î]}
is closed and unbounded.
Proof. (i) K1 ∩K2 is obviously closed. To see that it is unbounded, given î, choose
successively î0, î1, î2, . . . so that
î < î0
and
î0 ∈K1,
î0 < î1
and
î1 ∈K2,
î1 < î2
and
î2 ∈K1,
etc.
and check that î∗= limn în ∈K1 ∩K2 because both K1, K2 are closed.

378
8. Metamathematics
[8C.4
(ii) Again, K∗is obviously closed. Given î, deﬁne în by the recursion on ù
î0 = î
în+1 = în + 1 + supremum{f(æ) : æ < în},
where the supremum exists by replacement and verify that ç = î0 < î1 < · · · and
limn→∞în ∈K∗.
⊣
For each class M (which may be a set), let (M, ∈) be the structure obtained by
restricting the membership condition to M, i.e.,
(M, ∈) = (M, EM)
where
EM(x, y) ⇐⇒x ∈M & y ∈M & x ∈y.
This notational convention will simplify many formulas and cannot cause any confu-
sion.
We will prove the Reﬂection Theorem in a general context because it has many
applications, but in a ﬁrst reading one may as well take Cî = Vî.
8C.4. The Reﬂection Theorem. Let î 7→Cî be an operation on ordinals to sets
which is deﬁnable in L∈and satisﬁes the following two conditions:
(i) æ ≤î =⇒Cæ ⊆Cî.
(ii) If ë is a limit ordinal, then
Cë = S
î<ë Cî.
Let
C = S
î Cî.
Then for each formula ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) of L∈, there is closed, unbounded class of ordinals
K such that for î ∈K and x1, . . . , xn ∈Cî,
(C, ∈) |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒(Cî, ∈) |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn).
In particular, if ϕ is any sentence of L∈, then
(C, ∈) |= ϕ =⇒for some î, (Cî, ∈) |= ϕ.
Proof. We use induction on ϕ(x1, . . . , xn), the result being trivial for prime formulas
and following easily from the induction hypothesis for negations and conjunctions.
Suppose (∃y)ϕ(y, x1, . . . , xn) is given and assume that K satisﬁes the result for
ϕ(y, x1, . . . , xn). Let
G(x1, . . . , xn) =



least î such that (∃y ∈Cî)[(C, ∈) |= ϕ(y, x1, . . . , xn)]
if one such î exists,
0 otherwise
and take
F (î) = supremum{G(x1, . . . , xn) : x1, . . . , xn ∈Cî}
by replacement. By the lemma then, the class of ordinals
K ∩{î : (∀ç < î)[F (ç) < î]} ∩{î : î is limit}
is closed and unbounded and it is easy to verify that it satisﬁes the theorem for the
formula (∃y)ϕ(y, x1, . . . , xn).

It follows that every recursive function on ù (extended to be = 0 for arguments not
in ù) is deﬁnable in L∈and that every recursive relation on ù is deﬁnable in L∈(as a

induction on the deﬁnition of recursive function.

There is also a generalization of 8C.2 which is useful. (Recall from Chapter 2 that

R ⊆S × S is a condition which is deﬁnable in L∈and which is wellfounded, i.e.,

A class M is transitive if
x ∈M & y ∈x =⇒y ∈M.
In seeking models of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory we will concentrate on structures
of the form (M, ∈) with M transitive, partly because of the following basic fact.
8C.9 (The Mostowski Collapsing Lemma). Show that if M is a transitive class,
then the structure (M, ∈) satisﬁes the Axiom of Extensionality.
Conversely, suppose M is a class, E ⊆M × M is a binary strict wellfounded
condition on M which is deﬁnable in L∈and for each x ∈M, {y : E(y, x)} is a set.
Assume that (M, E) satisﬁes the Axiom of Extensionality; prove that there is a unique
transitive class M and a unique bijection
ð : M ֌
→M
which is an isomorphism of (M, E) with (M, ∈). Moreover, if there is a transitive set
y ⊆M such that x ∈y and E agrees with ∈on y, then ð(x) = x.
Show also that if M, E are deﬁnable in L∈, then so are M, ð.
Hint. The ﬁrst assertion is quite easy and will follow from the more genera 8D.3,
but the inexperienced reader will do well to check it out.
For the second assertion deﬁne ð : M →V by the recursion
ð(x) = {ð(y) : E(y, x)}
and take M = ð[M] = {ð(x) : x ∈M}.
If y is transitive and y ⊆M, show by ∈-induction that
t ∈y =⇒ð(t) = t.
⊣
(By ∈-induction in this hint we mean the method of proof where you show
(∀x)[(∀t ∈x)R(t) =⇒R(x)]
and you infer
(∀x)R(x);
this is easy to justify using the Axiom of Foundation.)
The Mostowski Collapsing Lemma is a very useful fact to which we will appeal
often. In the typical case we will be applying it to a structure of the form (M, ∈),
where M will not be necessarily transitive. In this case of course we will only need to
check that (M, ∈) satisﬁes extensionality, since the condition of membership in (M, ∈)
EM(x, y) ⇐⇒x ∈M & y ∈M & x ∈y
is automatically wellfounded; if it does, then we have a canonical isomorphism
ð : M ֌
→M
of M with the transitive class M, the so-called Mostowski collapsing map of M. (Of
course, if M is a set, then so is M.)

(Notice that 8C.9 applies because (Vî, ∈) and hence (B, ∈) satisﬁes extensionality;
notice also that you are using the Axiom of Choice in this proof because the Skolem-
L¨owenheim theorem needs Vî to be wellorderable.)
⊣
What we would really like to have is a countable transitive set A such that (A, ∈) |=
ZF, but we cannot prove that such a set exists assuming just the axioms of ZFC for V .
The next result gives us these countable, transitive models of ZFC, granting a strongly
inaccessible cardinal.
8C.11. Show that if the Axiom of Choice holds and κ is strongly inaccessible, then
(Vκ, ∈) |= ZFC; infer that if there exists a strongly inaccessible cardinal, then there
exists a countable, transitive model of ZFC.
Hint. All the axioms of ZFC except perhaps replacement hold in every (Vκ, ∈) with
limit κ—and replacement is easy to check using the strong inaccessibility. The second
assertion is proved as in 8C.10.
⊣
This result appears a bit paradoxical at ﬁrst sight, since a transitive model (A, ∈) of
ZFC satisﬁes the formal sentence of L∈
“there exists an uncountable set”,
so for some x ∈A,
(A, ∈) |= “x is uncountable”.
If A is countable, surely x is countable, so in the real world (the universe V ) there
exists a bijection f : ù ֌
→x; the explanation of the paradox is that no such bijection
can be a member of A.
8D. G¨odel’s universe of constructible sets
We will deﬁne here the class L of constructible sets and we will prove that the
structure (L, ∈) satisﬁes all the axioms of ZF.
The key idea is to imitate the deﬁnition of the partial universes Vî but to replace
the power operation (about which we know very little) by the much more tractable
operator on sets
Def(A) =

x ⊆A : x is elementary in the structure (A, ∈, {s : s ∈A})
	
.
We must ﬁrst show that Def is deﬁnable in L∈.

Recall that in 8A we assigned integer codes to the formulas of a language Lu of
a given characteristic. In the next result we use these codes to refer (indirectly) to
formulas and deﬁnability notions in general within the language L∈. We continue the
numbering of Theorem 8C.1.
8D.1. Theorem. The following conditions and operations on V and objects in V are
deﬁnable in L∈. (When we use variables m, n, k, it is understood that the conditions in
question do not hold and the operations in question are set = ∅, unless m, n, k ∈ù.)
#21. TC(x) = the transitive closure of x
= the smallest transitive set y such that x ∈y.
#22. nA = {h : h is a function with domain n = {0, 1, . . . , n −1}
and values in A.
#23. Formula(m, n) ⇐⇒m is the code of some formula ϕ(v0, . . . , vn−1) of
the language L∈whose free variables are among
v0, . . . , vn−1
.
#24. Sat(m, n, x, A, e) ⇐⇒Formula(m, n)

& e ⊆A × A

if ϕ(v0, . . . , vn−1) is the formula with code
m, then

#25. Def1(m, n, x, A, e) =

s ∈A : Sat(m, n + 1, x ∪{⟨⟨n, s⟩⟩}, A, e)
	
.
#26. Def(A) =

Def1(m, n, x, A, {⟨⟨u, v⟩⟩: u ∈v & u ∈A & v ∈A}) :
m ∈ù & n ∈ù & x ∈nA
	
.
Proof. #21. TC(x) = S{TC(n, x) : n ∈ù}, where TC(n, x) is deﬁned by the
recursion
TC(0, x) = {x},
TC(n + 1, x) = S TC(n, x).
#22. Use recursion again,
0A = ∅,
(n+1)A = {y ∪{⟨⟨n, t⟩⟩} : y ∈nA & t ∈A}.
#23 is immediate since Formula(m, n) is recursive.
#25 and #26 will follow immediately, once we prove that the satisfaction condition
is deﬁnable.
To prove the latter, deﬁne
F1(m, n, x, A, e) =

if m is the code of some formula ϕ(v0, . . . , vn−1) with

and put
F (m, A, e) = {⟨⟨i, n, x, F1(i, n, x, A, e)⟩⟩: n ∈ù & i < m ∈ù
& x ∈nA & e ⊆A × A};
it is enough to show that F is deﬁnable in L∈, since
Sat(m, n, x, A, e) ⇐⇒⟨⟨m, n, x, 1⟩⟩∈F (m + 1, A, e).

8D.1]
8D. G¨odel’s universe of constructible sets

To show that F is deﬁnable by applying 8C.6, we need deﬁnable operations G1, G2
such that
F (0, A, e) = G1(A, e),
F (m + 1, A, e) = G2
 F (m, A, e), m, A, e

.
The ﬁrst of these is trivial, since
F (0, A, e) = ∅.
On the other hand,
F (m + 1, A, e) = F (m, A, e) ∪G3(m, A, e)
where G3(m, A, e) = ∅, unless m is the code of some formula ϕ(v0, . . . , vn−1); and if
m is the code of some such formula, then we can easily compute G3(m, A, e) from
F (m, A, e) because of the inductive nature of the deﬁnition of satisfaction—and the
fact that in our coding formulas are assigned bigger codes than their subformulas. For
example, if
m = ⟨3, j, k⟩
so that m is the code of some formula
(∃vj)(ϕ)
where k is the code of ϕ, then
G3(m, A, e) =

⟨⟨m, n, x, 1⟩⟩: m ∈ù & x ∈nA & e ⊆A × A
& (∃l)(∃y ∈lA)

j < l & n ≤l & (∀i < n)[i ̸= j =⇒x(i) = y(i)]
& ⟨⟨k, l, y, 1⟩⟩∈F (m, A, e)

∪

⟨⟨m, n, x, 0⟩⟩: m ∈ù & x ∈nA & e ⊆A × A
& (∀l)(∀y ∈lA)

j < l & n ≤l & (∀i < n)[i ̸= j =⇒x(i) = y(i)]
=⇒⟨⟨k, l, y, 0⟩⟩∈F (m, A, e)
	
.
Similar expressions for G3(m, A, e) can be found for the other cases where m codes a
formula and then we can easily put these together to deﬁne G2(w, m, A, e). We will
omit the details.
⊣
It is obvious from the deﬁnition of the operation Def that
x ∈Def(A) ⇐⇒x ⊆A and there is a formula ϕ(v0, . . . , vn−1, vn) in the
language L∈and members x0, . . . , xn−1 of A, such that for
all s ∈A, s ∈x ⇐⇒(A, ∈) |= ϕ(x0, . . . , xn−1, s).
We now deﬁne the constructible hierarchy {Lî : î ∈ON} by the recursion
L0 = ∅,
Lî+1 = Def(Lî),
Lë = S
î<ë Lî, if ë is a limit ordinal
and we let
L = S
î Lî
be the class of constructible sets. More generally, for any set A, put
L0(A) = TC(A),
Lî+1(A) = Def

Lë(A) = S
î<ë Lî(A), if ë is a limit ordinal

384
8. Metamathematics
[8D.2
and
L(A) = S
î Lî(A).
8D.2. Theorem.
(i) The operation î 7→Lî is deﬁnable in L∈and the class L is a
deﬁnable class.
(ii) ç ≤î =⇒Lç ⊆Lî.
(iii) Each Lî is a transitive set and L is a transitive class.
Similarly,
(iv) The operation (î, A) 7→Lî(A) is deﬁnable in L∈and if A is a deﬁnable set, then
L(A) is a deﬁnable class.
(v) ç ≤î =⇒Lç(A) ⊆Lî(A).
(vi) Each Lî(A) is a transitive set and L(A) is a transitive class.
Proof. (i) follows from 8C.2 since it is easy to ﬁnd a deﬁnable G : V →V such
that
Lî = G({⟨⟨ç, Lç⟩⟩: ç < î}),
see 8C.8.
To prove (ii) and (iii) we show simultaneously by induction that for each î,
Lî is transitive and ç < î =⇒Lç ⊆Lî.
This is trivial for î = 0 or limit ordinals î.
If î = æ + 1, suppose ﬁrst that ç < î and x ∈Lç; by induction hypothesis then
x ∈Læ and x ⊆Læ, so that x ∈Læ+1, since we can obviously deﬁne x as a subset of
Læ using x as a parameter,
s ∈x ⇐⇒(Læ, ∈) |= s ∈x.
In particular, Læ ⊆Læ+1 and hence for any x ∈Læ+1 and y ∈x, we have y ∈Læ and
hence y ∈Læ+1, so Læ+1 is also transitive.
Now L is easily transitive as the union of transitive sets and (iv)–(vi) are proved
similarly.
⊣
The transitivity of L was well worth pointing out because of the following general
fact about transitive classes. (Σ0 formulas are deﬁned on page 379).
8D.3. Lemma. Let M be a transitive class.
(i) If ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) is a formula in Σ0 with the indicated free variables and x1, . . . , xn ∈
M, then
(V, ∈) |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒(M, ∈) |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn).
(ii) The structure (M, ∈) satisﬁes the Axioms of Extensionality and Foundation in the
list ZF.
(iii) If M is closed under pairing and union, then (M, ∈) satisﬁes the Axioms of Pairing
and Union.
(iv) If some inﬁnite ordinal ë ∈M, then (M, ∈) satisﬁes the Axiom of Inﬁnity.
Proof. (i) Reverting to the notation of 8A which is more appropriate here, we must
show that if ϕ is a formula in Σ0 and x = {xj} is any assignment into M, then
(V, ∈), x |= ϕ ⇐⇒(M, ∈), x |= ϕ.

8D.4]
8D. G¨odel’s universe of constructible sets
385
This is immediate for prime formulas, e.g.,
(V, ∈), x |= vi ∈vj ⇐⇒xi ∈xj
⇐⇒(M, ∈), x |= vi ∈vj
and if it holds for ϕ and ø, it obviously holds for ¬(ϕ) and for (ϕ) & (ø). By induction
on the length of formulas then, in the non-trivial case,
(V, ∈), x |= (∃vi)[vi ∈vj & ϕ] ⇐⇒for some z ∈xj, (V, ∈), xz |= ϕ
where
xz
k =
(
xk
if k ̸= i,
z
if k = i;
but since M is transitive and xj ∈M, we have xj ⊆M and hence for every z ∈xj the
assignment xz is into M, so that by the induction hypothesis,
for some z ∈xj, (V, ∈), xz |= ϕ ⇐⇒for some z ∈xj, (M, ∈), xz |= ϕ
⇐⇒(M, ∈), x |= (∃vi ∈vj)ϕ.
(ii) It is easy to check that both of these axioms are expressed in L∈by formulas of
the form
(∀x1) · · · (∀xn)ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
where ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) is in Σ0. Hence
(V, ∈) |= (∀x1) · · · (∀xn)ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
=⇒for all x1, . . . , xn, (V, ∈) |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
=⇒for all x1, . . . , xn ∈M, (M, ∈) |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
(using (i))
=⇒(M, ∈) |= (∀x1) · · · (∀xn)ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
and since these axioms hold in (V, ∈), they must also hold in (M, ∈).
(iii) Again, it is easy to ﬁnd a formula ϕ(x, y, z) in Σ0 such that
z = {x, y} ⇐⇒(V, ∈) |= ϕ(x, y, z).
To show that (M, ∈) satisﬁes the Pairing Axiom then, we must verify that for each
x ∈M, y ∈M, there is some z ∈M such that (M, ∈) |= ϕ(x, y, z); of course, we
take z = {x, y} and we use (i).
The argument for the Union Axiom is similar.
(v) If ë ∈M and ë is inﬁnite, then either ù = ë or ù ∈ë and in either case, by
the transitivity of M, ù ∈M. Checking #20 and then #19 and #18 of 8C.1, we can
construct a Σ0 formula ϕ(x) such that
x = ù ⇐⇒(V, ∈) |= ϕ(x);
in part ϕ(x) asserts that x is the z required to exist by the Axiom of Inﬁnity. Clearly
(V, ∈) |= ϕ(ù) and then by (i), (M, ∈) |= ϕ(ù) so that (M, ∈) satisﬁes the Axiom of
Inﬁnity.
⊣
The lemma implies immediately that (L, ∈) satisﬁes all the axioms of ZF except
perhaps for the Power and Replacement Axioms. The key to deriving these for (L, ∈)
is the Reﬂection Theorem 8C.4.
It is worth putting down a general result.
8D.4. Theorem. Let î 7→Cî be an operation on ordinals to sets which is deﬁnable in
L∈and satisﬁes the following four conditions.

386
8. Metamathematics
[8D.4
(i) Each Cî is a transitive set.
(ii) æ ≤î =⇒Cæ ⊆Cî.
(iii) If ë is a limit ordinal, then Cë = S
î<ë Cî.
(iv) For each î, if x ⊆Cî is elementary in the structure
Cî = (Cî, ∈, {s : s ∈Cî}),
then there is some æ such that x ∈Cæ.
Let C = S
î Cî; then the structure
C = (C, ∈)
is a model of ZF which furthermore contains all the ordinals.
In particular, (L, ∈) and each
 L(A), ∈

are models of ZF which contain all the
ordinals.
Proof. To begin with, we know from 8D.3 that C satisﬁes extensionality, foundation,
pairing and union, since condition (iv) in the hypothesis implies easily that C is closed
under pairing and union.
We argue that C must contain all ordinals; if not, let ë be the least ordinal not in C
and choose î large enough so that ë ⊆Cî. Let ϕ(x) be a formula in Σ0 such that
Ordinal(x) ⇐⇒(V, ∈) |= ϕ(x);
this is easy to construct from the expression given in #18 of 8C.1. Since no ordinal
≥ë can be in Cî (by transitivity), we have
{x ∈Cî : Cî |= ϕ(x)} = ë;
hence by condition (iv), ë ∈C, which is a contradiction.
It follows in particular that ù ∈C, so that C satisﬁes the Axiom of Inﬁnity by 8D.3.
Veriﬁcation of the Power Axiom. It is enough to show that for each x ∈C, there
is some z ∈C such that z has as members precisely all the members of C which are
subsets of x—from this we can infer that C satisﬁes the Power Axiom by arguments
familiar from the proof of 8D.3 and above.
Consider the operation
F (u) =
(
least î such that u ∈Cî,
if u ∈C & u ⊆x,
0
otherwise;
this is obviously deﬁnable in L∈, so by the Replacement Axiom, the image F [Power(x)]
is a set. (We are using the fact that x has a power set in V .) Now F [Power(x)] is a
set of ordinals, so there must be an ordinal ë above all of them and we have: if u ∈C
and u ⊆x, then u ∈Cë. Thus
z = {u ∈Cë : u ⊆x}
has as members precisely the subsets of x which are in C and since z is clearly deﬁnable
in Cë, it is a member of C by (iv).
Veriﬁcation of the Axiom Scheme of Replacement. Suppose x ∈C and F : C →C
is an operation which is deﬁnable (with parameters) on C, i.e., for some formula
ø(v1, . . . , vn, s, t) and ﬁxed y1, . . . , yn ∈C,
F (s) = t ⇐⇒C |= ø(y1, . . . , yn, s, t)
(s, t ∈C);

8D.9]
8D. G¨odel’s universe of constructible sets
387
as above, it is enough to show that the image
F [x] = {F (s) : s ∈x}
is also a member of C.
Using the Reﬂection Theorem, choose ë so that x, y1, . . . , yn ∈Cë and for s, t ∈Cë,
C |= ø(y1, . . . , yn, s, t) ⇐⇒(Cë, ∈) |= ø(y1, . . . , yn, s, t)
and make sure as in the argument above that F [x] ⊆Cë; clearly
F [x] = {t ∈Cë : Cë |= (∃s)[s ∈x & ø(y1, . . . , yn, s, t)]}
and hence F [x] is elementary in Cë and must be in C by (iv).
This concludes the proof of the main part of the theorem and the fact that L and
L(A) satisfy the hypotheses follows easily from their deﬁnitions.

Exercises
Let us take up ﬁrst a few simple exercises which will help clarify the deﬁnability
notions we have been using.
8D.5. Show that if R(x1, . . . , xn) is deﬁnable by a Σ0 formula, then the condition
R∗(k1, . . . , kn) ⇐⇒k1 ∈ù & · · · & kn ∈ù & R(k1, . . . , kn)
is recursive.
A little thinking is needed for the next one.
8D.6. Prove that the condition of satisfaction in #24 of 8C.4 is not deﬁnable by a
Σ0 formula.
A formula of L∈is in Σ1 if it is of the form
(∃y1) · · · (∃yn)ϕ(y1, . . . , yn, x1, . . . , xm),
where ϕ(y1, . . . , yn, x1, . . . , xm) is Σ0. The next result is not entirely trivial and we will
not appeal to it later, but it is useful to understand.
8D.7. Prove that every condition, operation and object in #1–#26 of 8C.1 and 8D.1
is deﬁnable by a Σ1 formula. (A weak form of the Axiom of Choice is needed.)
Hint. The key fact is to check that if a condition R(y, x1, . . . , xn) is deﬁnable by a
Σ1 formula, then so is the condition
Q(z, x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒(∀y ∈z)R(y, x1, . . . , xn)
⊣
8D.8. Prove that if ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) is a Σ1 formula, M is a transitive class, x1, . . . , xn ∈
M and (M, ∈) |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn), then (V, ∈) |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn).
8D.9. Suppose F : V →V is an operation deﬁnable by a Σ1 formula ϕ(x, y) and
suppose that we can prove in ZF that (∀x)(∃!y)ϕ(x, y); prove that for every transitive
model (M, ∈) of ZF,
x ∈M =⇒F (x) ∈M.
Hint. Use the fact that (M, ∈) |= (∀x)(∃!y)ϕ(x, y), which follows from the hypoth-
esis that (M, ∈) |= ZF and that (∀x)(∃!y)ϕ(x, y) is a theorem of ZF.

The rank of a set x is the least ordinal î such that x ∈Vî+1. It is easy to check that
this can be deﬁned also by the recursion on ∈
rank(x) = supremum{rank(y) + 1 : y ∈x}
(where supremum(∅) = 0) and that for each ordinal î,
rank(î) = î.
8D.10. Show that for each î, Lî ⊆Vî so that
x ∈Lî =⇒rank(x) ≤î.
Show also that for each î,
î ∈Lî+1.
Hint. Lî ⊆Vî is easy by induction. The second assertion follows from
î = {x ∈Lî : Ordinal(x)},
8D.3 and the fact that Ordinal(x) can be deﬁned by a Σ0 formula.
⊣
8D.11. Show that for each ordinal î ≥ù,
card(Lî) = card(î).
Hint. Use induction on î and a bit of cardinal arithmetic; you need to check
(without using the Axiom of Choice) that if κ is an inﬁnite cardinal, then the sets
S{nκ : n ∈ù} and κ × κ do not have bigger cardinality than κ.

The nature of the constructible hierarchy {Lî : î ∈ON} makes it possible to deﬁne
explicitly a wellordering of L. We will outline a proof of this result in some detail in
the next exercise, as it is the key to our showing in the next section that the Axiom of
Choice holds in (L, ∈).
8D.12. Prove that there is a binary condition x ≤L y which is deﬁnable in L∈and
wellorders L and such that
x ≤L y & y ∈Lî =⇒x ∈Lî.
In particular, if V = L (i.e., if every set is in L), then the Axiom of Choice holds.
Hint. The idea is to construct an operation
f : ON →V
which is deﬁnable in L∈and such that for each î, F (î) is a wellordering of Lî—i.e.,
F (î) ⊆Lî × Lî and the condition
u ≤î v ⇐⇒⟨⟨u, v⟩⟩∈F (î)
wellorders Lî.
We will build up F step-by-step.
1. There is an operation F1 : ù × V × V →V which is deﬁnable in L∈and such

In the last result of the preceding section (8D.12) we just about proved that the
structure (L, ∈) satisﬁes the Axiom of Choice. In fact we showed that there is a certain
deﬁnable condition x ≤L y such that
if every set is in L, then {(x, y) : x ≤L y} wellorders the collection of all sets;
(1)
since in the structure (L, ∈) every set is obviously in L, the structure (L, ∈) satisﬁes the
hypothesis of (1) and therefore it must satisfy the conclusion, which is a very strong
“global” form of the Axiom of Choice.
To see that matters are not quite as simple as that, let us try to express (1) in the
language L∈. Choose ﬁrst a formula ϕL(x, î) of L∈by 8D.2 so that
x ∈Lî ⇐⇒(V, ∈) |= ϕL(x, î)
(2)
and let
V = L ⇐⇒(∀x)(∃î)ϕL(x, î),
(3)
so that this formal sentence “V = L” clearly expresses in L∈the proposition that
every set is constructible. Choose then another formula øL(x, y) of L∈by 8D.12 such
that
x ≤L y ⇐⇒(V, ∈) |= øL(x, y)
and take
ø∗⇐⇒“{(x, y) : øL(x, y)} is a wellordering of V ”,
where it is easy to turn the symbolized English in quotes into a formal sentence of L∈.
Now (1) is expressed by the formal sentence of L∈
V = L →ø∗
(4)
and what we would like to prove is that
(L, ∈) |= ø∗.
(5)
It is important here that 8D.12 was proved on the basis of the axioms in ZF without
appeal to the Axiom of Choice. Since (L, ∈) is a model of ZF by 8D.4, it must also
satisfy all the consequences of ZF and certainly
(L, ∈) |= V = L →ø∗.
(6)
Now the hitch is that in order to infer (5) from (6), we must prove
(L, ∈) |= V = L;
(7)
this is what we took as “obvious” in the ﬁrst paragraph above, after expressing it
sloppily in English by “every set in the structure (L, ∈) is in L.” But is (7) obvious?
By the deﬁnition of satisfaction and the construction of the sentence V = L above,
(7) is equivalent to
for each x ∈L, there exists î ∈L such that (L, ∈) |= ϕL(x, î),
(8)
while what we know is
for each x ∈L, there exists î ∈L such that (V, ∈) |= ϕL(x, î).

Thus, to complete the proof of (7) and verify that (L, ∈) satisﬁes the Axiom of Choice,
we must prove that we can choose the formula ϕL(x, î) so that in addition to (2), it
also satisﬁes
(V, ∈) |= ϕL(x, î) ⇐⇒(L, ∈) |= ϕL(x, î),
(10)
when x ∈L. In other words, we must show that the basic condition of constructibility
can be deﬁned in L∈so that the model (L, ∈) recognizes that each of its members is
constructible.
The theory of absoluteness which we will develop to do this is the key to many other
results, including the fact that V = L implies the generalized continuum hypothesis.
We will study here the basic facts about absoluteness and then we will derive the
consequences about L in 8F.
Since we will be considering only structures of the form (M, ∈) let us simplify
notation and write
M |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒(M, ∈) |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn);
similarly, for sets of sentences of L∈,
M |= T ⇐⇒(M, ∈) |= T
⇐⇒for each ϕ ∈T, (M, ∈) |= ϕ.
We will call M a standard model of a set of sentences T in L∈(a set theory) if M is a
transitive class (perhaps a set) and M |= T; if in addition M contains all the ordinals,
we will call M an inner model of T—so that by 8D.4, L and each L(A) are inner models
of ZF.
Let D be a collection of transitive classes and let R be an n-ary condition on V . We
say that R is deﬁnable in L∈absolutely for D or simply absolute for (classes in) D if
there exists a formula ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) of L∈such that for every M in D and x1, . . . , xn
in M,
R(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒M |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn).
This notion is the key metamathematical tool for the study of models of set theory.
Notice that if ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) deﬁnes R absolutely for D, then in particular for M, N
in D, if M ⊆N and x1, . . . , xn ∈M, then
M |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒N |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn).
In all the cases we will consider, the universe V will be in D; then for each M in D and
x1, . . . , xn ∈M, we have
R(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒V |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
⇐⇒M |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn).
Following the same idea, an operation F : C1 × · · · × Cn →V (where C1, . . . , Cn
are given classes) is deﬁnable in L∈absolutely for D or just absolute for D, if three
things hold.
(1) The classes C1, C2, . . . , Cn are absolute for D—i.e., each membership condition
x ∈Ci is absolute for D.
(2) If M ∈D and x1 ∈C1 ∩M, . . . , xn ∈Cn ∩M, then
F (x1, . . . , xn) ∈M.

392
8. Metamathematics
[8E.1
(3) There is a formula ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, y) of L∈such that for each M ∈D and
x1 ∈C1 ∩M, . . . , xn ∈Cn ∩M,
F (x1, . . . , xn) = y ⇐⇒M |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, y).
An object c is absolute for D if for each M ∈D,
c ∈M
and the condition
Rc(x) ⇐⇒x = c
is absolute for D.
It is common to also call absolute for D the relevant formula ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) of L∈
which deﬁnes a given condition, operation or constant as above.
If D consists of just two classes, V and some M, we will say absolute for M instead
for absolute for D.
We now come to the important metamathematical concept of ZF-absoluteness.
Let us collectively call notions the relations and operations on V as well as the
members of V . A notion N is ZF-absolute if there exists a ﬁnite set T 0 ⊆ZF of
axioms in ZF such that N is absolute for the collection D of standard models of T 0,
M ∈D ⇐⇒M |= T 0.
Intuitively, a notion N is ZF-absolute if there is a formula of L∈which deﬁnes N in
all suﬃciently good approximations to standard models of ZF.
We will need to know that a good many notions are ZF-absolute. Before embarking
on this let us establish the closure properties of the collection of ZF-absolute notions
in the next simple but basic theorem.
8E.1. Theorem.
(i) The collection of ZF-absolute conditions contains ∈and = and
is closed under the propositional operations ¬, & , ∨, =⇒, ⇐⇒.
(ii) The collection of ZF-absolute operations is closed under addition and permutation
of variables and under composition; each n-ary projection operation
F (x1, . . . , xn) = xi
is ZF-absolute.
(iii) An object c ∈V is ZF-absolute if and only if each n-ary constant operation
F (x1, . . . , xn) = c
is ZF-absolute.
(iv) If R ⊆V m and F1 : C1 × · · · × Cn →V, . . . , Fm : C1 × · · · × Cn →V are all
ZF-absolute and
P(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒x1 ∈C1 & · · · & xn ∈Cn
& R
 F1(x1, . . . , xn), . . . , Fm(x1, . . . , xn)

,
then P is also ZF-absolute.
(v) If R ⊆V n+1 is ZF-absolute and
P(x1, . . . , xn, z) ⇐⇒(∃y ∈z)R(x1, . . . , xn, y),
Q(x1, . . . , xn, z) ⇐⇒(∀y ∈z)R(x1, . . . , xn, y),
then P and Q are also ZF-absolute.

8E.1]
8E. Absoluteness
393
(vi) Suppose P ⊆V n+1 is ZF-absolute, Q ⊆V n+1 and there exists a ﬁnite T 0 ⊆ZF
such that for each transitive M |= T 0 and x1, . . . , xn ∈M,
(∃y ∈M)P(x1, . . . , xn, y) ⇐⇒)(∀y ∈M)Q(x1, . . . , xn, y);
then the condition R ⊆V n deﬁned by
R(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒(∃y)P(x1, . . . , xn, y)
is ZF-absolute.
(vii) If G : V n+1 →V is ZF-absolute, then so is F : V n+1 →V deﬁned by
F (x1, . . . , xn, w) = {G(x1, . . . , xn, t) : t ∈w};
similarly with more variables, if G : V n+m →V is ZF-absolute, so is
F (x1, . . . , xn, w1, . . . , wm)
= {G(x1, . . . , xn, t1, . . . , tm) : t1 ∈w1 & · · · & tn ∈wn}.
(viii) If R ⊆V n+1 is ZF-absolute, then so is the operation
F (x1, . . . , xn, w) = {t ∈w : R(x1, . . . , xn, t)}.
Proof. Parts (i) – (iv) are very easy, using the basic properties of the language L∈.
For example if
R(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒P(x1, . . . , xn) & Q(x1, . . . , xn)
with P and Q given ZF-absolute conditions, choose ﬁnite T 0 ⊆ZF, T 1 ⊆ZF and
formulas ϕ(x1, . . . , xn), ø(x1, . . . , xn) of L∈such that for M |= T 0, x1, . . . , xn ∈M,
P(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒M |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)
and for M |= T 1, x1, . . . , xn ∈M,
Q(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒M |= ø(x1, . . . , xn).
It is clear that if M |= T 0 ∪T 1 and x1, . . . , xn ∈M, then
R(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒M |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) & ø(x1, . . . , xn),
so the formula ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) & ø(x1, . . . , xn) deﬁnes R absolutely on all standard
models of T 0 ∪T 1.
Suppose again that
F (x) = G
 H1(x), H2(x)

where G, H1, H2 are ZF-absolute and we have chosen one binary and two unary
operations to simplify notation. Choose ﬁnite subsets T G, T 1, T 2 of ZF and formulas
ø(u, v, z), ϕ1(x, u), ϕ2(x, v) of L∈such that for M |= T G and u, v, z ∈M we have
G(u, v) ∈M and
G(u, v) = z ⇐⇒M |= ø(u, v, z)
and similarly with H1, T 1 and ϕ1(x, u), H2, T 2 and ϕ2(x, v). (It is easy to arrange that
the free variables in these formulas are as indicated.) Now it is clear that if
M |= T G ∪T 1 ∪T 2,
then
x ∈M =⇒F (x) ∈M
and for x, z ∈M,
F (x) = z =⇒M |= ÷(x, z)

394
8. Metamathematics
[8E.1
where
÷(x, z) ⇐⇒(∃u)(∃v)[ϕ1(x, u) & ϕ2(x, v) & ø(u, v, z)].
Proof of (iv) is very similar to this.
(v) The argument is very similar to the proof of (i) in 8D.3 and we will omit it—the
transitivity of M is essential here.
(vi) Choose a formula ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, y) and a ﬁnite T P ⊆ZF such that for all
M |= T P and x1, . . . , xn ∈M,
P(x1, . . . , xn, y) ⇐⇒M |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, y)
and take
÷(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒(∃y)ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, y).
If M |= T P ∪T 0 and x1, . . . , xn ∈M, then
R(x1, . . . , xn) =⇒(∃y)P(x1, . . . , xn, y)
=⇒(∀y)Q(x1, . . . , xn, y)
(since V |= T 0)
=⇒(∀y ∈M)Q(x1, . . . , xn, y)
(obviously)
=⇒(∃y ∈M)P(x1, . . . , xn, y)
(since M |= T 0)
=⇒for some y ∈M, M |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, y)
(since M |= T P)
=⇒M |= (∃y)ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, y);
Conversely,
M |= (∃y)ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, y) =⇒(∃y ∈M)P(x1, . . . , xn, y)
=⇒(∃y)P(x1, . . . , xn, y)
=⇒R(x1, . . . , xn),
so ÷(x1, . . . , xn, y) deﬁnes R on all models of T P ∪T 0 and hence R is ZF-absolute.
(viii) Suppose that if M |= T 0, then
x1, . . . , xn, t ∈M =⇒G(x1, . . . , xn, t) ∈M
and
G(x1, . . . , xn, t) = s ⇐⇒M |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, t, s).
Letø be the instance ofthe ReplacementAxiom Scheme which concerns ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, t, s),
ø ⇐⇒(∀x1) · · · (∀xn)(∀w)

(∀t)(∃!s)ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, t, s)
→(∃z)(∀s)

s ∈z ↔(∃t)[t ∈w & ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, t, s)]
	
and take
T 1 = T 0 ∪{ø}.
If M |= T 1 and x1, . . . , xn, w ∈M, this means easily that there is some z ∈M so that
for all a ∈M,
s ∈z ⇐⇒for some t ∈w, M |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, t, s)
⇐⇒(∃t ∈w)[G(x1, . . . , xn, t) = s].
Since M |= T 0 and hence M is closed under G, this implies that in fact
z = {G(x1, . . . , xn, t) : t ∈w}
= F (x1, . . . , xn, w),

8E.2]
8E. Absoluteness
395
hence M is closed under F . Moreover, taking
÷(x1, . . . , xn, w, z) ⇐⇒(∀s)

s ∈z ↔(∃t)[t ∈w & ϕ(x1, . . . , xn, t, s)]

,
is is clear that
F (x1, . . . , xn, w) = z ⇐⇒M |= ÷(x1, . . . , xn, w, z),
os F is ZF absolute.
The argument with m > 1 is similar.
(viii) Let
G(x1, . . . , xn, z, t) =
(
t
if R(x1, . . . , xn, t),
z
if ¬R(x1, . . . , xn, t),
so that G is ZF-absolute and by (vii), the operation
F1(x1, . . . , xn, z, w) = {G(x1, . . . , xn, z, w) : t ∈w} ∩w
is also (easily) ZF-absolute. Clearly
s ∈F1(x1, . . . , xn, z, w) ⇐⇒s ∈w & R(x1, . . . , xn, s)
∨[s = z & z ∈w & (∃t)¬R(x1, . . . , xn, t)];
since ZF implies that we cannot have w ∈w, we then have
s ∈F1(x1, . . . , xn, w, w) ⇐⇒s ∈w & R(x1, . . . , xn, s)
and we can take
F (x1, . . . , xn, w) = F1(x1, . . . , xn, w, w)
⊣
We will now apply this basic theorem to show that many natural notions are ZF-
absolute.
8E.2. Theorem. The notions #1 – #20 of Theorem 8C.1 are all ZF-absolute.
Proof. It is enough to establish the ZF-absoluteness of #1 – #5, since the notions
following #5 are easily proved absolute using 8E.1. Now ∈, ⊆and = are deﬁnable by
Σ0 formulas, so they are ZF-absolute by 8D.3; we will outline the proof for pairing,
that for union being similar.
Let ø be the normal sentence of L∈which expresses the Axiom of Pairing and
suppose M is a transitive class which satisﬁes ø. This means that for each x, y in M
there is some w in M such that
M |= (∀t)[t ∈w ⇐⇒(t = x ∨t = y)].
(∗)
We claim that in fact w = {x, y}; this is because (∗) simply means that (in V )
(∀t ∈M)[t ∈w ⇐⇒(t = x ∨t = y)]
and since M is transitive we have w ⊆M, so easily
(∀t)[t ∈w ⇐⇒(t = x ∨t = y)],
i.e., w = {x, y}.
This means that every transitive M which satisﬁes ø is closed under the pairing
operation. Since the condition {x, y} = w is obviously deﬁnable by a Σ0 formula which
is absolute for all transitive classes, the operation (x, y) 7→{x, y} is ZF-absolute.
⊣

8. Metamathematics
[8E.3
Before proceeding to show the ZF-absoluteness of several other notions, it will be
instructive to notice that many natural and useful notions are not ZF-absolute. Roughly
speaking, no notion related to cardinality is ZF-absolute. the key for these proofs is
the Countable Reﬂection Theorem 8C.10.
8E.3. Theorem. None of the following notions is ZF-absolute: N, Cardinal(κ), R,
x 7→Power(x), x 7→Card(x) = least ordinal equinumerous with x.
Proof. If N were ZF-absolute, then N would be a member of every standard model
A of some ﬁnite T 0 ⊆ZF; but N is uncountable and T 0 has countable standard models
by 8C.10.
To take another example, suppose the condition Cardinal(κ) were ZF-absolute,
so that there exists a formula ϕ(κ) of L∈and a ﬁnite T 0 ⊆ZF such that for every
transitive M |= T 0 and for κ ∈M,
Cardinal(k) ⇐⇒M |= ϕ(κ).
Now it is true in V that
(∃x)(∃κ)[x = ù & Cardinal(κ) & ù ∈κ]
and of course we can express this proposition by a formal sentence ø, using ϕ(κ)
to express Cardinal(κ) and expressing x = ù by some ÷(x) which is absolute for all
standard models of some T 1 ⊆ZF. By the ZF absoluteness of ù, we can also make
sure that ù belongs to all standard models of T 1.
By the Countable Reﬂection Theorem 8C.10, choose a countable, transitive M such
that M |= T 0 ∪T 1 ∪{ø}. Clearly ù ∈M and for some κ ∈M,
M |= ϕ(κ) & ù ∈κ
so by the alleged absoluteness property of ϕ(κ),
Cardinal(κ) & ù ∈κ.
However this is absurd since κ is a countable set (it belongs to a transitive countable
set) and κ ̸= ù.
⊣
(The proof we gave used the Axiom of Choice, but the result does not depend on
this axiom by 8F.14.)
The next result is fundamental.
8E.4. Mostowski’s Theorem. The condition
WF(r) ⇐⇒r is a wellfounded relation
is ZF-absolute.
Proof. Put
P(r, x) ⇐⇒r is a relation
& {either x is not a subset of Field(r) or
x = ∅or x has an r-minimal member}
⇐⇒Relation(r)
& {(∃t ∈x)[t /∈Field(t)]
∨x = ∅
∨(∃u ∈x)(∀v ∈x)[⟨⟨v, u⟩⟩∈r =⇒⟨⟨u, v⟩⟩∈r]}

8E.4]
8E. Absoluteness
397
using the notation of 8C.1. Clearly P is ZF-absolute and
WF(r) ⇐⇒(∀x)P(r, x).
Similarly, let
Q(r, f) ⇐⇒r is a relation
& {f is a function which maps Field(r) into
the ordinals in an order-preserving
fashion}
⇐⇒Relation(r) & Function(f)
& Domain(f) = Field(r)
&
 ∀î ∈Image(f)

 ∀x ∈Field(r)
 ∀y ∈Field(r)

{[⟨⟨x, y⟩⟩∈r & ⟨⟨y, x⟩⟩/∈r]
=⇒f(x) < f(y)}.
Again Q is ZF-absolute and obviously
WF(r) ⇐⇒(∃f)Q(r, f).
Hence
(∀r){(∀x)P(x, r) =⇒(∃f)Q(r, f)}.
(∗)
Now we come to a subtle point in the argument. How did we recognize that (∗) is
true? The answer is that we proved (∗) from the axioms of ZFC, the only assumptions
we make about sets without explicit notice. If the reader takes the time to actually
write down a proof of (∗), he will realize that in that proof he does not use the Axiom
of Choice and he appeals to only ﬁnitely many axioms of ZF.
Let T 0, T 1 be ﬁnite subsets of ZF such that P and Q are absolute for standard
models of T 0 and T 1 respectively and let T ∗be the ﬁnite subset of ZF we needed
to establish (∗).
A moment’s reﬂection shows that if M is a standard model of
T 0 ∪T 1 ∪T ∗, then M satisﬁes the formal sentence of L∈which expresses (∗); in other
words, for r ∈M,
(∀x ∈M)P(x, r) =⇒(∃f ∈M)Q(r, f).
(∗∗)
Now part (vi) of 8E.1 implies immediately that WF(r) is ZF-absolute.
⊣
The argument in this proof is typically metamathematical and will undoubtedly
cause some uneasiness to those without a good background in logic.
One simple fact we used was that if M |= T and ϕ is a logical consequence of T,
then M |= ϕ. This is a basic property of mathematical proofs which has nothing to
do with set theory—any logical consequence of group theory will hold in all groups,
any property of Banach spaces whose proof does not appeal to the completeness of
the norm will in fact hold for all normed linear spaces, etc.
The observation that in proving (∗) we only used a ﬁnite number of axioms from ZF
(and that therefore (∗) holds in all models of these ﬁnitely many axioms) is a bit more
subtle and it would be a good idea for the novice in metamathematics to actually put
down a proof of (∗) and list all the axioms of ZF that are needed. (Assuming WF(r)
deﬁne f : Field(r) →ON by the recursion
f(x) = S
f(y) ∪{f(y)} : y <r x
	
,
see 8C.2.)

8. Metamathematics
[8E.5
In fact, any theorem of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory which is expressible by a sentence
of L∈can be proved using only ﬁnitely many axioms of ZF; this is because a “proof”
in Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory is nothing but a ﬁnite sequence of propositions, all
of them expressible in L∈and each being either an axiom of ZF or a “purely logical
consequence” of propositions preceding it. It follows that the formal sentence of L∈
expressing some theorem of ZF holds in all standard models M of some suﬃciently large,
ﬁnite T 0 ⊆ZF.
We will often appeal to these metamathematical observations to save ourselves from
having to put down long, complicated proofs. In principle, the reader could always
supply the ﬁnite T 0 ⊆ZF needed, by working out in full detail a proof of the relevant
theorem.
The same kind of metamathematical argument is needed in the proof of the next
result.
8E.5. Theorem. Suppose G : V n+1 →V is a ZF-absolute operation and
F : ON × V n →V
is the unique operation satisfying
F (î, x1, . . . , xn) = G
 {⟨⟨ç, F (ç, x1, . . . , xn)⟩⟩: ç < î}, x1, . . . , xn

;
then F is also ZF-absolute. (ZF-absoluteness of deﬁnition by recursion on the ordi-
nals.)
Proof. Assume G is absolute for all transitive models of T 0 ⊆ZF. Go back to the
proof of 8C.2 to recall that F is deﬁned by an expression of the form
F (î, x1, . . . , xn) = w ⇐⇒(∃h){P(î, x1, . . . , xn, h) & Function(h)
& î ∈Domain(h) & h(î) = w},
where P is easily absolute for all models of T 0. Moreover, we can prove
(∀î, x1, . . . , xn)(∃h)P(î, x1, . . . , xn, h)
using only ﬁnitely many additional instances of the Axiom Scheme of Replacement,
say T 1 ⊆ZF. Thus for every standard model M of T 0 ∪T 1 and î, x1, . . . , xn in
M we have (∃h ∈M)P(î, x1, . . . , xn, h), which implies immediately that M is closed
under F .
We can also prove easily in ZF (using only some ﬁnite T 2 ⊆ZF) that
(∀î, x1, . . . , xn, w)

(∃h)[P(î, x1, . . . , xn, h) & Function(h)
& î ∈Domain(h) & h(î) = w] ⇐⇒(∀h)

[P(î, x1, . . . , xn, h)
& Function(h) & î ∈Domain(h)] =⇒h(î = w

;
thus by part (vi) of 8E.1 the condition
R(î, x1, . . . , xn, w) ⇐⇒F (î, x1, . . . , xn) = w
is ZF-absolute and then easily F is ZF-absolute.

Exercises
A very natural question to ask at this point is: which analytical pointsets are ZF-
absolute? We have to be careful here, because the simplest pointset of type 1, N itself is
not ZF-absolute as an object by 8E.3—simply because it is uncountable. On the other
hand membership in N is easily ZF-absolute and it will turn out that all Σ1
1 pointsets
have this property.
To make the notions precise, call a set A absolute for (a collection of classes) D as
a condition or ZF-absolute as a condition if the corresponding membership condition
in A,
RA(x) ⇐⇒x ∈A
is absolute in the relevant sense.
Similarly, a function
f : A →B
is absolute for D as an operation or ZF-absolute as an operation, if the operation
F (x) =
(
f(x)
if x ∈A,
0
if x /∈A
is absolute in the relevant sense. For example, the identity function on N which sends
α to α is ZF-absolute as an operation, but not as a set of ordered pair (which is
uncountable).
8E.8. Show that all arithmetical pointsets of type 0 or 1 are ZF-absolute as condi-
tions.
Hint. For type 0 the result follows easily from 8C.1 and the closure properties of
ZF-absolute notions, 8E.1.
For type 1, ﬁrst compute
α ∈N ⇐⇒Function(α) & Domain(α) = ù & Image(α) ⊆ù;
so the condition
P(α) ⇐⇒α ∈N
is ZF-absolute. Again,
α(n) = m ⇐⇒α ∈N & n ∈ù & m ∈ù & ⟨⟨n, m⟩⟩∈α,

1 pointset of type 0 or 1 is ZF-absolute as a condition;
similarly, every ∆1

Hint. Given Q ⊆X1 × · · · × Xn with each Xi either ù or N and such that
Q(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒(∃α)(∀t)P
 x1, . . . , xn, α(t)

with P recursive as in 4A.1, put
F (x1, . . . , xn) = {⟨⟨u, v⟩⟩∈ù × ù : Seq(u) & Seq(v)
& v codes an initial segment of the sequence coded by u
& P(x1, . . . , xn, u)}.
Clearly F is ZF-absolute as an operation by 8E.1 and 8E.8 and
Q(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒¬WF
 F (x1, . . . , xn)

,
so Q is ZF-absolute, by Mostowski’s Theorem 8E.4.
To prove the second assertion, suppose
f : X →N
in ∆1
1 and put
Q(x, α, t, s) ⇐⇒f(x)(t) = s;
now Q is ∆1
1 and hence ZF-absolute as a condition and clearly
f(x) = {⟨⟨t, x⟩⟩: t, s ∈ù & Q(x, α, t, s)},
so that f is ZF-absolute as an operation by 8E.1
The result for f : X →Y1 × · · · × Yk with each Yi = ù or N follows easily.
⊣
In trying to extend this result to arbitrary product spaces we meet a problem: for
some basic space X, the recursive function
i 7→ri
which enumerates the ﬁxed recursive presentation of X may already fail to be ZF-
absolute. Suppose, for example, that we have carelessly adopted the deﬁnition of real
numbers as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of rationals. Now each real x is
an uncountable object and cannot be ZF-absolute by the argument of 8E.3.
In the case of R, we can easily correct this situation by adopting some other deﬁnition
of real numbers, e.g., in terms of Dedekind cuts, but for the general case we need the
following lemma.
8E.10. Show that each basic space (X, d) (which admits a recursive presentation)
is isomorphic with a space (X ∗, d ∗) where X ∗⊆N and (X ∗, d ∗) admits a recursive
presentation {r∗

1 , . . . } for which the conditions
P(x) ⇐⇒x ∈X ∗,
Q(x, y, m, k) ⇐⇒d ∗(y, y) <

Hint. Given X with metric d and recursive presentation {r0, r1, . . . }, choose by 4A.7
a Π0
1 set A ⊆N and a recursive ð : N →X, such that ð is injective on A and ð[A] = X.
Take X ∗= A and on X ∗deﬁne
d ∗(α, â) = d
 ð(α), ð(â)

.
Put also
r∗
i = f(ri),
where f : Z →N is a ∆1
1 inverse of ð.
It is immediate from 8E.8 that the conditions P and Q above are ZF-absolute, since
they are arithmetical relations on spaces of type 1. It is also clear that {r∗
0 , r∗
1 , . . . } is
a recursive presentation of X ∗. Moreover, the map
i 7→r∗
i
is easily ∆1
1 on ù to N, so it is ZF-absolute by 8E.9.
⊣
From now on we assume that we have replaced all basic spaces by isomorphic copies, if
necessary, so that the conditions of 8E.10 hold. This implies immediately that the same
conditions hold for every product space. We might as well put this down as part of
the stronger result that we need.
8E.11. Show that all Σ1
1 pointsets are ZF-absolute as conditions and all ∆1
1 functions
between product spaces are ZF-absolute as operations.
Hint. Check ﬁrst that for each X = X1 × · · · × Xk the membership condition
PX(x) ⇐⇒x ∈X
⇐⇒(∃x1) · · · (∃xk)[x1 ∈X1 & · · · & xk ∈Xk & x = ⟨⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩⟩]
is ZF-absolute.
(For transitive M, if ⟨⟨x1, . . . , xk⟩⟩∈M, then x1, . . . , xk ∈M.)
Similarly, the function i 7→ri and the basic nbhd condition {(x, s) : x ∈N(X, s)}
are easily ZF-absolute, from the same results about the basic spaces. Now every Σ0
1
pointset is of the form
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃s){x ∈N(X, s) & P∗(s)}
with P∗⊆ù, P∗semirecursive, so P is ZF-absolute. Finally, if P is Σ1
1, then
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃α)(∀t)R
 x, α(t)

with a semirecursive R and the argument that this is ZF-absolute as a condition is
exactly as in 8E.9 by appealing to the Mostowski’s Theorem 8E.4.
For ∆1
1 functions again the argument is the same as in 8F.3, using the fact that for
each basic space (X ∗, d ∗) we have X ∗⊆N by our convention.
⊣
8F. The basic facts about L
Let us start by collecting in one theorem the basic absoluteness facts about the
constructible hierarchy that follow from the results of 8E.

402
8. Metamathematics
[8F.1
8F.1. Theorem.
(i) The operation
î 7→Lî
and the condition
P(x, î) ⇐⇒x ∈Lî
are both ZF-absolute.
(ii) There is a canonical wellordering of L, x ≤L y which is ZF-absolute and such that
y ∈Lî & x ≤L y =⇒x ∈Lî.
(iii) The operation
(î, A) 7→Lî(A)
and the condition
P′(x, î, A) ⇐⇒x ∈Lî(A)
are both ZF-absolute.
(iv) The conditions
Q(x) ⇐⇒x ∈L
Q′(x, A) ⇐⇒x ∈L(A)
are both absolute for inner models of ZF.
Proof. (i) and (ii) follow immediately from the deﬁnitions, 8E.7, 8E.5 and of course,
the basic closure properties of ZF-absoluteness listed in 8E.1. Part (ii) also follows
easily by examining the proof of 8D.12.
To prove (iv), let ϕL(x, î) be a formula of L∈by (i) such that for some ﬁnite
T 0 ⊆ZF, whenever M is transitive and M |= T 0,
Ordinal(î) & x ∈Lî ⇐⇒M |= ϕL(x, î)
and let ø(x) be the formula
ø(x) ⇐⇒(∃î)ϕL(x, î).
If M is an inner model of ZF so that M |= ZF and M contains all the ordinals, then
for x ∈M, obviously
x ∈L ⇐⇒for some î, x ∈Lî
⇐⇒for some î ∈M, M |= ϕL(x, î)
⇐⇒M |= (∃î)ϕL(x, î).
The argument for x ∈L(A) is similar.
⊣
We are now in a position to prove what we claimed in the beginning of 8E.
Fix once and for all a formula ϕL(x, î) such that for all transitive models M of
some ﬁnite T 0 ⊆ZF and x, î in M,
x ∈Lî ⇐⇒M |= ϕL(x, î)
and let “V = L” abbreviate the formal sentence of L∈which says that every set is
constructible:
V = L ⇐⇒(∀x)(∃î)ϕL(x, î).
We also construct a similar formula
V = L(A)
with a free variable A which says that “every set is constructible from A”.

8F.4]
8F. The basic facts about L
403
8F.2. Theorem.
(i) L |= V = L.
(ii) For each set A,
L(A) |= V = L(A).
Proof. Compute:
L |= V = L ⇐⇒L |= (∀x)(∃î)ϕL(x, î)
⇐⇒for each x ∈L, there exists î ∈L, L |= ϕL(x, î)
⇐⇒for each x ∈L, there exists î ∈L, x ∈Lî,
and the last assertion is true by the deﬁnition of L and the fact that it contains all the
ordinals.
⊣
This is a very basic result about L. One of its applications is that it allows us to prove
theorems about L without constant appeal to metamathematical results and methods:
we simply assume V = L in addition to the axioms of ZF and any consequence of
these assumptions must hold in L.
We have already argued about the Axiom of Choice in the beginning of 8E, but we
should put the result down for the record.
8F.3. Theorem (G¨odel [1938], [1940]). There is a formula øL(x, y) of L∈such that
L |= “{(x, y) : øL(x, y)} is a wellordering of V ”.
In particular, L satisﬁes the Axiom of Choice.
Proof. If ø∗is the formal sentence of L∈expressing the symbolized English in
quotes, then by 8D.12 and the fact that L |= ZF,
L |= V = L →ø∗
while by 8F.2 we have L |= V = L.
⊣
For the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis we need a basic fact about L.
8F.4. The Condensation Lemma. There is a ﬁnite set of sentences T L of L∈such
that the following hold.
(i) L |= T L.
(ii) If A is a transitive set and A |= T L, then A = Lë for some limit ordinal ë.
(iii) For every inﬁnite ordinal î and every set x ∈L such that x ⊆Lî, there is some
ordinal ë such that
î ≤ë < î+,
Lë |= T L, and x ∈Lë.
Proof. Take
T L = T 0 ∪{V = L}
where both operations
î 7→î + 1,
î 7→Lî,
are absolute for the standard models of T 0 and the condition x ∈Lî is deﬁned on all
standard models of T 0 by the speciﬁc formula ϕL(x, î) which we used to construct
the sentence V = L.
Clearly L |= T L.
If A is transitive and A |= T L, let
ë = least ordinal not in A

404
8. Metamathematics
[8F.5
and notice that ë is a limit ordinal, since A is closed under the successor operation.
Now
î < ë =⇒Lî ∈A,
by the absoluteness of î 7→Lî, so
Lë = S
î<ë Lî ⊆A.
On the other hand, A |= V = L, so that
for each x ∈A, there exists î ∈A, A |= ϕL(x, î)
i.e. (by the absoluteness of ϕL(x, î)), A ⊆Lë.
To prove (iii) suppose x ⊆Lî and x ∈Læ. Using the Reﬂection Theorem 8C.4 on
the hierarchy {Lî : î ∈ON} and the fact that L |= T L, choose ì > æ, ì > î such
that Lì |= T L—so now x ∈Lì and Lì |= T L.
By the Skolem-L¨owenheim Theorem 8A.4 applied to the (wellorderable) structure
(Lì, ∈), we can ﬁnd an elementary substructure
(M, ∈) ⪯(Lì, ∈)
such that Lî ⊆M, x ∈M and card(M) = card(Lî) = card(î) by 8D.11. Since
(M, ∈) is elementarily equivalent with (Lì, ∈), it satisﬁes in particular the Extension-
ality Axiom, so by the Mostowski Collapsing Lemma 8C.9, there is a transitive set M
and an isomorphism
ð : M →M
of (M, ∈) with (M, ∈). Moreover, since the transitive set
y = Lî ∪{x} ⊆M,
we have
ð(x) = x
and hence x ∈M. Now (Lì, ∈) |= T L and therefore the elementarily equivalent
structure (M, ∈) |= T L, so that the isomorphic structure (M, ∈) |= T L; by (ii) then,
M = Lë
for some ë and of course, ë < î+, since card(M) = card(î).
⊣
From this key theorem we get immediately the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis
for L.
8F.5. Theorem (G¨odel [1938], [1940]). If V = L, then for each cardinal ë, 2ë = ë+.
Proof. By 8F.4, Power(ë) ⊆Lë+, and hence
card
 Power(ë)

≤card(Lë+) = ë+.
⊣
We should point out that the models L(A) need not satisfy either the Axiom of
Choice or the Continuum Hypothesis. For example, if in V truly 2ℵ0 > ℵ1, then there
is some surjection
ð : N ։ ℵ2
and obviously
L
 {⟨⟨α, ð(α)⟩⟩: α ∈N}

|= 2ℵ0 ≥ℵ2.
As another application of the basic Theorem 8F.1, we obtain intrinsic characteriza-
tions of the models L, L(A).
8F.6. Theorem. L is the smallest inner model of ZF and for each set A, L(A) is the
smallest inner model of ZF which contains A.

8F.7]
8F. The basic facts about L
405
Proof. Suppose M is an inner model of ZF and A0 ∈M. Since the operation
(î, A) 7→Lî(A)
is ZF-absolute, M is closed under this operation; since A0 ∈M and every ordinal
î ∈M, we have (∀î)[Lî(A0) ∈M] so that L(A0) ⊆M.
⊣
One consequence of this result is that for every perfect product space X,
L(X) = L(N),
simply because there is a ∆1
1 isomorphism between X and N which is ZF-absolute as
an operation by 8E.11. In particular,
L(N) = L(R)
= the smallest inner model which contains all real numbers.
At this point we can deliver on our promise in Chapter 5 and show that if N ⊆L,
then N admits a Σ1
2-good wellordering.
Recall that ≤L is the canonical wellordering of L which by 8F.1 satisﬁes
y ∈Lî & x ≤L y =⇒x ∈Lî.
8F.7. Theorem (G¨odel [1940], Addison [1959b]).
(i) The pointset N ∩L of con-
structible irrationals is Σ1
2.
(ii) The restriction of ≤L to N is a Σ1
2-good wellordering of N ∩L; i.e., if P ⊆N × X
is in Σ1
2, then so are the conditions
Q(α, x) ⇐⇒(∃â ≤L α)P(â, x),
R(α, x) ⇐⇒α ∈L & (∀â ≤L α)P(â, x).
(iii) If N ⊆L, then N admits a Σ1
2-good wellordering of rank ℵ1.
Proof. (i) is an easy consequence of (ii), but it is more instructive to show (i) ﬁrst.
First of all, we claim that if T L is the ﬁnite set of sentences of the basic Lemma 8F.4,
then
α ∈L ⇐⇒there exists a countable, transitive set A such that
(A, ∈) |= T L and α ∈A.
(1)
The implication (⇐=) in (1) is immediate, because by 8F.4, if (A, ∈) |= T L, then
A = Lë for some ordinal ë. For the other direction, notice that (as a set of pairs of
integers), each α is a subset of Lù so by (iii) of 8F.4
α ∈L ⇐⇒for some countable ë, α ∈Lë and Lë |= T L.
The key idea of the proof is that the structures of the form (A, ∈) with countable
transitive A can be characterized up to isomorphism by the Mostowski Collapsing
Lemma 8C.9. In fact, if (M, E) is any structure with countable M and E ⊆M × M,
then by 8C.9, immediately
(M, E) is isomorphic with some (A, ∈) where A is transitive
⇐⇒E is wellfounded and (M, E) |=“axiom of extensionality”;

406
8. Metamathematics
[8F.7
thus
α ∈L ⇐⇒there exists a countable, wellfounded structure (M, E) such
that (M, E) |= “axiom of extensionality”, (M, E) |= T L
and α ∈M = the unique transitive set such that (M, E) is
isomorphic with (M, ∈).
(2)
To see how to express the last condition in a model-theoretic way, recall that the
condition “α ∈N” is ZF-absolute by 8E.8 and choose some ϕ0(α) such that for all
transitive models M of some T0 ⊆ZF,
α ∈N ⇐⇒M |= ϕ0(α).
Next deﬁne for each integer n a formula øn(x) which asserts that x = n, by the
recursion
ø0(x) ⇐⇒x = 0,
øn+1(x) ⇐⇒(∃y)[øn(y) & x = y ∪{y}]
and for each n, m, let
øn,m(α) ⇐⇒(∃x)(∃y)[øn(x) & øm(y) & ⟨⟨x, y⟩⟩∈α].
It is obvious that
α ∈L ⇐⇒there exists a countable, wellfounded structure (M, E) such
that (M, E) |= “axiom of extensionality”, (M, E) |= T L
and for some a ∈M, (M, E) |= ϕ0(a) and for all n, m,
α(n) = m ⇐⇒(M, E) |= øn,m(a).
(3)
The point of this model-theoretic computation is that we can code countable struc-
tures by irrationals, as we did in 8A and then the satisfaction condition is ∆1
1 by 8A.6.
Recall that in the notation established for 8A.5 and 8A.6, we associated with each
characteristic u and irrational â a structure A(u, â), so that in the case u = 8 which
corresponds to the language of set theory L∈,
A(8, â) =
 {t : (â)0(t) = 1}, {(t, s) : (â)0(t) = (â)0(s) = 1 & (â)1(⟨t, s⟩) = 1}

;
moreover
Sat(8, â, m, x) ⇐⇒A(8, â) is a structure (i.e., it has a non-empty domain) & m
is the code of a formula ÷m of L∈& x is an assignment in
A(8, â) to the free variables of ÷m (i.e., whenever vi is free
in ÷m then (â)0
 (x)i

= 1) & A(8, â), (x)0, (x)1, . . . |= ÷m
and this pointset Sat is ∆1
1.
Let
f(m, n) = the code of the formula øm,n(α),
so that f is obviously a recursive function. Let also k0 be the code of the conjunction
of the sentences in T L and the Axiom of Extensionality and let k1 be the code of the
formula ϕ0(α) which deﬁnes α ∈N; we are assuming that both in øm,n(α) and in

8F.8]
8F. The basic facts about L
407
ϕ0(α), the free variable α is actually the ﬁrst variable v0. It is now clear that
α ∈L ⇐⇒(∃â)
n
Sat(8, â, k0, 1)
& {(t, s) : (â)0(t) = (â)0(s) = 1 & (â)1(⟨t, s⟩) = 1}
is wellfounded
& (∃a)

& (∀n)(∀m)

α(n) = m ⇐⇒Sat
 8, â, f(n, m), ⟨α⟩
io
which implies directly that L ∩N is Σ1
2 (using the fact that wellfoundedness is Π1
1).
To prove (ii), let øL(v0, v1) be a formula which deﬁnes the canonical wellordering of
L absolutely on all models of some ﬁnite T L
1 ⊆ZF (by (ii) of 8F.1) and let SL ⊆ZF
be ﬁnite and large enough to include T L
1 , T L, the Axiom of Extensionality and the
set T0 os part (i), chosen so that ϕ0(α) deﬁnes α ∈N on all transitive models of T0.
Using the key fact
α ∈Lî & â ≤L α =⇒α ∈Lî
and Mostowski collapsing as above, we can verify directly that for α ∈L and arbitrary
P ⊆N × X,
(∀â ≤L α)P(â, x)
⇐⇒there exists a countable, wellfounded structure (M, E) |= SL and
some a ∈M such that (M, E) |= ϕ0(a) and
(∀n)(∀m)[α(n) = m ⇐⇒(M, E) |= øn,m(a)]
and (∀b)

(M, E) |= ϕ0(b) & øL(b, a) =⇒
(∃â)

(∀n)(∀m)[â(n) = m
⇐⇒(M, E) |= øn,m(b)] & P(â, x)
	
.
If P is Σ1
2, then it is easy to see that this whole expression on the right leads to a Σ1
2
condition by coding the structures (M, E) by irrationals as above—the key being that
the universal quantiﬁer ∀â has been turned to the number quantiﬁer ∀b.
⊣
We put down the argument for (i) in considerable detail, because it illustrates a
very useful technique for making analytical computations of conditions deﬁned by
set-theoretic constructions.
For the next result we will do the opposite, i.e., we will give a set-theoretic construc-
tion for Σ1
2 pointsets which will establish that they are all absolute as conditions for L.
It is useful to derive this fundamental result of Shoenﬁeld from a strong representa-
tion theorem for Σ1
2 subsets of N, which is nothing more than the metamathematical
content of the proof of 2D.3—that Σ1
2 sets are ℵ1-Suslin.
8F.8. Shoenﬁeld’s Lemma. Suppose A ⊆N is a Σ1
2 set of irrationals. Then there
exists a ZF-absolute operation
î 7→T î
which assigns to each ordinal î ≥ù a tree T î on ù × î such that the following holds,
where ë is any uncountable ordinal:
α ∈A ⇐⇒(∃î ≥ù)[T î(a) is not wellfounded ]
⇐⇒(∃î ≥ù)[î < ℵ1 & T î(α) is not wellfounded ]
⇐⇒T ë(α) is not wellfounded.

8. Metamathematics
[8F.8
Proof. One can derive this very easily by re-examining the proof of 2D.3 and
applying the absoluteness theory at the key points, but it is also simple enough to put
down a complete proof.
Choose a recursive R so that
α ∈A ⇐⇒(∃â)(∀ã)(∃t)R
 α(t), â(t), ã(t)

by 4A.1 so that for each α, â, the set of sequences

In the computation below we will represent Sα,â by the set of codes ⟨c0, . . . , cs−1⟩of
sequences (c0, . . . , cs−1) ∈Sα,â.
For each î ≥ù, deﬁne ﬁrst a tree Sî on ù × (ù × î) as follows:

î ≤ç =⇒Sî ⊆Sç.

α ∈A ⇐⇒(∃î ∈ℵ1)[Sî(α) is not wellfoounded],

Sî(α) is not wellfounded =⇒α ∈A.
(3)
(To prove (2) choose â = (b0, b1, . . . ) such that Sα,â is wellfounded, choose f :
Sα,â →ℵ1 as in (1) above, and for i = ⟨c0, . . . , cs−1⟩with (c0, . . . , cs−1) ∈Sα,â,
take îi = f(c0, . . . , cs−1)—for i not of this form take îi = 0. To prove (3), choose
an inﬁnite branch (b0, î0), (b1, î1), . . . in Sî(α), take â = (b0, b1, . . . ) and deﬁne
f : Sα,â →î by
f(c0, . . . , cs−1) = îi ⇐⇒i = ⟨co, . . . , cs−1⟩
so that it immediately satisﬁes the condition in (1).)

that Sî is a tree on ù × (ù × î) rather than a tree on ù × î. To complete the proof,

8F.9. Shoenﬁeld’s Theorem (I) (Shoenﬁeld [1961]). Each Σ1
2 pointset is absolute
as a condition for all standard models M of some ﬁnite T∗⊆ZF such that ℵ1 ⊆M.
In particular, if A ⊆ùn is Σ1
2(α0) and α0 ∈L, then A ∈L; similarly, if â ∈∆1
2(α0)
and α0 ∈L, then â ∈L.
Proof. Take ﬁrst A ⊆N and let ϕ(î, T) be a formula of L∈by the lemma such
that for all standard models M of some ﬁnite T1 ⊆ZF,
î ∈M =⇒T î ∈M,
T = T î ⇐⇒M |= ϕ(î, T).
Notice also that the operation
(α, T) 7→T(α)
is easily ZF-absolute, so choose ø(α, S, T) so that for all standard models M of some
ﬁnite T2 ⊆ZF,
α, T ∈M =⇒T(α) ∈M,
S = T(α) ⇐⇒M |= ø(α, S, T).
Finally use Mostowski’s Theorem 8E.4 to construct a formula ÷(S) of L∈such that
for all standard models M of some ﬁnite T3 ⊆ZF and S ∈M,
S is wellfounded ⇐⇒M |= ÷(S).
Now if M is any standard model of
T∗= T1 ∪T2 ∪T3

α ∈A ⇐⇒there exists some î ∈M such that T î(α) is not wellfounded
⇐⇒there exists some î ∈M such that
M |= (∃S)(∃T)[ϕ(î, T) & ø(α, S, T) & ¬÷(S)]
⇐⇒M |= (∃î)(∃S)(∃T)[ϕ(î, T) & ø(α, S, T) & ¬÷(S)].
The result for arbitrary Σ1
2 pointsets P ⊆X follows easily by considering A = f[P],
where f : X →N is a ∆1

To prove the second assertion, take A ⊆ù for simplicity of notation and suppose
n ∈A ⇐⇒P(n, α0)
where P is Σ1
2 and α0 ∈L and let ø(n, α) deﬁne P absolutely as in the ﬁrst part, so
that in particular
P(n, α) ⇐⇒L |= ø(n, α).

The sentence
(∀α)(∃x)

x ⊆ù & (∀n)[n ∈x ⇐⇒ø(n, α)]

is a theorem of ZF and hence it holds in L. Taking α = α0, this implies that there is
some x ∈L such that x ⊆ù and for all n,
L |= n ∈x ⇐⇒ø(n, α0),
so that
n ∈x ⇐⇒L |= ø(n, α0)
⇐⇒P(n, α0)
⇐⇒n ∈A;
thus x = A and A ∈L.
If â ∈∆1
2(α0), with α0 ∈L, apply this to
A(n, m) ⇐⇒â(n) = m
to infer that A ∈L and hence â ∈L.

To appreciate the signiﬁcance of Shoenﬁeld’s Theorem, recall from the exercises
of 8B that a formula è(α1, . . . , αm) of the language of second order arithmetic A2 is
Σ1
n if
è(α1, . . . , αm) ⇐⇒(∃â 1)(∀â 2)(∃â 3) · · · (−â n)ϕ(α1, . . . , αm, â1, . . . , â n),
where ϕ(α1, . . . , αm, â1, . . . , â n) has no quantiﬁers over N.
It is clear that we
can interpret these formulas over standard models of ZF simply by putting (for
α1, . . . , αm ∈M),
M |= è(α1, . . . , αm) ⇐⇒(ù, N ∩M, +, ·, ap, 0, 1) |= è(α1, . . . , αm),
i.e., by interpreting the quantiﬁers ∃â i, ∀â i as ranging over the irrationals in M and
using the standard interpretations for the operations +, ·, ap (which are ZF-absolute
by 8E.8) and the quantiﬁers ∃n, ∀n (since ù is also ZF-absolute and hence a member
of M).
8F.10. Shoenﬁeld’s Theorem (II) (Shoenﬁeld [1961]). (i) If è(α1, . . . , αm) is a Σ1
2
or Π1
2 formula of second order arithmetic, then for every standard model M of ZF such
that ℵ1 ⊆M and α1, . . . , αm ∈M,
V |= è(α1, . . . , αm) ⇐⇒M |= è(α1, . . . , αm);
in particular, if α1, . . . , αm ∈L, then
V |= è(α1, . . . , αm) ⇐⇒L |= è(α1, . . . , αm).
(ii) If we can prove a Σ1
2 or Π1
2 sentence è by assuming in addition to the axioms in ZF
the hypothesis V = L (and its consequences AC and GCH), then è is in fact true (i.e.,
V |= è).
Proof. Take a Σ1
2 sentence for simplicity of notation
è ⇐⇒(∃α)(∀â)ϕ(α, â),
and let
P(α, â) ⇐⇒A2 |= ϕ(α, â)

be the arithmetical pointset deﬁned by the matrix of è so that
V |= è ⇐⇒(∃α)(∀â)P(α, â)
M |= è ⇐⇒(∃α ∈M)(∀â ∈M)P(α, â).
Using the Basis Theorem for Σ1
2, 4E.5,
V |= è =⇒(∃α)(∀â)P(α, â)
=⇒(∃α ∈∆1
2)(∀â)P(α, â)
(by 4E.5)
=⇒(∃α ∈M)(∀â)P(α, â)
(by 8F.9)
=⇒(∃α ∈M)(∀â ∈M)P(α, â)
(obviously)
=⇒M |= è.
Conversely, assuming that M |= è, choose some α0 ∈M such that
(∀â ∈M)P(α0, â)
and assume towards a contradiction that
(∃â)¬P(α0, â);
by the Basis Theorem 4E.5 again, we then have
 ∃â ∈∆1
2(α0)

¬P(α0, â)
so that by 8F.9,
(∃â ∈M)¬P(α0, â)
contradicting our assumption end establishing (∀â)P(α0, â), i.e., V |= è.
The second assertion follows immediately because if we can prove è using the
additional hypothesis V = L, then we know that L |= è by 8F.2 and hence V |= è by
the ﬁrst assertion.
⊣
This theorem is quite startling because so many of the propositions that we consider
in ordinary mathematics are expressible by Σ1
2 sentences—including all propositions
of elementary or analytic number theory and most of the propositions of “hard
analysis”. The techniques in the proof of 8F.1 allow us to prove that many set theoretic
propositions are also equivalent to Σ1
2 sentences. Theorem 8F.8 assures us then that
the truth or falsity of these “basic” propositions does not depend on the answers to
diﬃcult and delicate questions about the nature of sets like the continuum hypothesis;
we might as well assume that V = L in attempting to prove or disprove them.
Of course, in descriptive set theory we worry about propositions much more com-
plicated than Σ1
2 which may well have diﬀerent truth values in L and in V .
Exercises
We should put down for the record one of the best known results that comes out of
the theory of constructibility.
8F.11. Prove that the proposition V = L, the Axiom of Choice AC and the gener-
alized continuum hypothesis GCH are consistent with ZF—i.e., we cannot prove the
negation of any of these propositions in ZF. (G¨odel [1938], [1940].)
Hint. All these propositions hold in L so none of them can be refuted from the
axioms of ZF which also hold in L.

[8F.12
A few remarks are in order in this proof.
We developed the theory of constructibility here with no appeal to the Axiom of
Choice, so there is no use of choice in this argument. On the other hand, we have
presented this proof in the same general framework in which we have proved all the
other results in this book—i.e., we have assumed that we have the structure (V, ∈)
which satisﬁes all the axioms of ZF (even though it may fail to satisfy AC) and that
we can reason about this structure in the ordinary way. Granting these assumptions
and these methods of proof, the hint outlines a valid argument for the consistency of
ZF with V = L, AC and GCH.
It is customary in mathematical logic to give consistency proofs on the basis of
minimal hypotheses and in fact the consistency of ZF with V = L, AC and GCH
can be established assuming only that ZF is formally consistent and using only very
basic, combinatorial arguments. To give that argument, we would have to give a
precise deﬁnition of formal logical consequence (or formal proof ) which would take
us far aﬁeld from descriptive set theory. Suﬃce it to say that anyone who knows
the rudiments of the theory of formal proofs will have no diﬃculty turning the hint
above into a constructive, combinatorial demonstration of the consistency of ZF with
V = L, AC and GCH, granting only the formal consistency of ZF.
We should also point out that at least as far as AC is concerned, the observation that
we did not use the Axiom of Choice in 8F.11 is essential, if we are to have a nontrivial
theorem. Because if we assume that (V, ∈) also satisﬁes AC, then it is obvious that
¬AC cannot be a consequence of ZF—or else (V, ∈) would satisfy both AC and ¬AC.
Next we put down two results about the Axiom of Choice in the models L(A).
8F.12. Prove that if A is a set of constructible sets (A ⊆L), then L(A) satisﬁes the
Axiom of Choice. (Notice that the hypothesis holds if A is any set of ordinals.)
Hint. Rework the proof of 8D.12 to show that there is a ZF-absolute condition
P(A, W, x, y) such that whenever W ⊆A × A is a wellordering of TC(A), then
{(x, y) : P(A, W, x, y)} is a wellordering of L(A). Now argue that if A ⊆L, we can
ﬁnd in L(A) a wellordering W of TC(A) and complete the proof as in 8F.3.
⊣
8F.13. Prove that the model L(N) satisﬁes the Axiom of Dependent Choices, DC.
(You will need to use the fact that V |= DC.)
Hint. Show ﬁrst that for every ordinal î, there is some ordinal ëî and a surjection
ðî : ëî × N ։ Lî(N),
such that ðî ∈L(N). (Use induction on î. In the successor case, it is enough to
construct from any surjection ð : ë × N ։ A, a ñ : ë′ × N ։ S{nA : n ∈ù}. In the
limit case, you may assume given surjections ðî : ë′ × N ։ Lî(N), for each î < ë;
put ﬁrst
ð(î, ç, α) = ðî(ç, α)
and deﬁne ñ : ë∗× N ։ Lë(A) by ñ(æ, α) = ð
 ñ1(æ), ñ2(æ), α

, where the function
æ 7→
 ñ1(æ), ñ2(æ)

is a surjection of ë∗onto ë′ × ë′.
Suppose now that P, A ∈Lë(N), with A ̸= ∅and P ⊆A × A, and assume that
(∀x ∈A)(∃y ∈A)P(x, y); we must show that there is a function f : ù →A in
L(N) such that (∀n)P
 f(n), f(n + 1)

. By DC in V , there is some inﬁnite sequence
x0, x1, x2, . . . in V such that (∀n)P(xn, xn+1), with each xi ∈A. If ð : ë×N ։ Lë(N)
is a surjection which lies in L(N), we can further choose ordinals æn, αn (in V ) such

that xn = ð(æn, αn). Now forget about the ordinals æn, but check that the function
n 7→αn lies in L(N), because it can be coded by a single irrational.
On ù × ë deﬁne the binary relation
(k, î) < (m, ç) ⇐⇒k = m + 1 & P
 ð(ç, αm), ð(î, αk)

;
this relation lies in L(N) and it is not wellfounded in V , because we have
(0, æ0) > (1, æ1) > (2, æ2) > · · · .
By Mostowski’s Theorem 8E.4 then, this relation is not wellfounded in L(ùù), so that
we have a function n 7→în in L(N) such that
(∀n)P
 ð(în, αn), ð(în+1, αn+1)

and we can ﬁnally take f(n) = ð(în, αn).
⊣
8F.14. Prove (without using the Axiom of Choice) that for every ﬁnite set T0 of
axioms of ZF, there is a countable transitive set M such that M |= T0.
Hint. Imitate that proof of the Countable Reﬂection Theorem 8C.10 using the
hierarchy {Lî : ë ∈ON} instead of {Vî : ë ∈ON}.
⊣
8F.15. Prove that there is a smallest standard model of ZF (Shepherdson [1951],
Cohen [1963a]).
Hint. If no set M |= ZF, then every standard model of ZF is an inner model and
L is the least standard model by 8F.6.
Assume now that some transitive set M |= ZF. Since we proved that L |= ZF using
only the fact that V |= ZF, it follows that for every transitive set M and for every
sentence ϕ ∈ZF,
M |= ZF =⇒M |= “the collection of constructible sets satisﬁes ϕ”,
where for each ϕ, the expression in quotes can be easily transformed into a sentence
of L∈. Now argue using 8F.1 that for M |= ZF and x ∈M,
M |= “x is constructible” ⇐⇒x ∈M ∩L
and if ë is the least ordinal not in M and M |= ZF,
M ∩L = Lë.
Thus the least model of ZF is Lë, where ë is a the least ordinal such that Lë |= ZF. ⊣
8F.16. Prove that if N \L ̸= ∅, then the pointset N ∩L is not Π1
2 (Shoenﬁeld [1961]).
Hint. If it were, then N \ L would be Σ1
2 and thus have a ∆1
2 member by 4E.5,
contradicting Shoenﬁeld’s Theorem 8F.9.
⊣
8F.17. Prove that if N \ L ̸= ∅, then Π1
3 sentences of the language of second order
arithmetic are not absolute for L—i.e., for some such sentence è, L |= è but V |= ¬è
(Shoenﬁeld [1961]).
8F.18. Prove that not all Σ1
2 pointsets are ZF-absolute as conditions.
Hint. If every Σ1
2 pointset were ZF-absolute, then (easily) there would be a ﬁnite
T0 ⊆ZF such that every standard model of T0 would contain all Σ1
2 sets of integers.
Using the technique in the proof of 8F.7 argue that if
P(â) ⇐⇒A(8, â) is a wellfounded model of T0,

414
8. Metamathematics
[8F.19
then every Σ1
2 set of integers must be recursive in any â such that P(â) and hence every
∆1
2 irrational must be recursive in every â such that P(â); but P is Σ1
2 and by 8F.14
and the Basis Theorem 4E.5 there must exist some â ∈∆1
2 such that P(â), which is
absurd.
⊣
We now turn to the study of so-called relative constructibility.
Consider structures of the form
(M, ∈, P),
where P ⊆M. The language L∈,1 of these structures is obtained by adding a unary
relation symbol P to L∈and interpreting P(x) by x ∈P.
8F.19. Prove that there is a ZF-absolute operation Def(A, P) such that for any two
sets A, P,
x ∈Def(A, P) ⇐⇒x ⊆A & there is a formula ϕ(v0, . . . , vn−1, vn) in
the language L∈,1 and members x0, . . . , xn−1 of A,
such that
s ∈z ⇐⇒(A, ∈, P ∩A) |= ϕ(x0, . . . , xn−1, s).
Hint. Look up the proof of 8D.1 and alter the deﬁnition of the satisfaction condi-
tion #24 to take account of the additional unary condition P ∩A.

(vi) Prove that A ∩L[A] ∈L[A] and
L[A] = L(A ∩L[A]);
in particular,
A ⊆L =⇒L[A] = L(A).
Hint. (i) – (iv) are established exactly like the corresponding results for the Lî’s.
To show (v), check by induction on î that if A ∩L[A] = B ∩L[A], then Lî[A] =
Lî[B]; then take B = A ∩L[A].
For (vi) argue ﬁrst that A ∩L[A] ⊆Lî[A] for some ordinal î, and then easily
A∩L[A] ∈Lî+1[A]. The ZF-absoluteness of (î, A) 7→Lî[A] also implies immediately
that L[A] ⊆L(A), so applying this to A ∩L[A] we get
L

A ∩L[A]

⊆L(A ∩L[A]);
hence L[A] = L

A∩L[A]

⊆L(A∩L[A]). On the other hand, given A∩L[A] ∈L[A],
the ZF-absoluteness of (î, A) 7→Lî(A) again implies that L(A ∩L[A]) ⊆L[A].
Finally, if A ⊆L ⊆L[A], then A ∩L[A] = A.
⊣
Caution: Since relative constructibility is often studied in the case where A is a set
of ordinals, when L[A] = L(A), there is some confusion in the literature between
the notations L[A] and L(A) and the clear distinction we have established here is not
always observed.
Notice that by 8F.20, if α ∈N, then
L[α] = L(α);
on the other hand,
L[N] = L,
since for each transitive set A the membership condition in the set N ∩A is certainly
deﬁnable in (A, ∈).
In general, L[A] is a much better model than L(A).
8F.21. Show that for each set A, L[A] satisﬁes the Axiom of Choice.

some ordinal ë such that

8G. Regularity results and inner models
We already know from 6G.10 – 6G.12 that if there exists a measurable cardinal,
then Σ
e
1
2 pointsets are absolutely measurable, they all have the property of Baire and
every uncountable Σ
e
1
2 set has a perfect subset. In this section we will derive interesting
metamathematical reﬁnements of these regularity properties and extensions of them
to the higher Lusin pointclasses.
In proving these results, we will introduce and study brieﬂy some very interesting
inner models of ZF which are much like L but which also satisfy various forms of
deﬁnable determinacy.
We start with a beautiful and very useful result of Mansﬁeld which we will establish
by rethinking the proof of the Perfect Set Theorem 2C.2 in the light of the theory of
absoluteness.
8G.1. Mansﬁeld’s Lemma (Mansﬁeld [1970]). Suppose M is a standard model of
ZF, T is a tree on ù × κ, T ∈M and
A = p[T] = {α ∈N : T(α) is not wellfounded};
then either A ⊆M or A has a perfect subset.
Proof (Solovay). Following the proof of 2C.2, assign to each tree S on ù × κ and
each ordinal î the tree Sî by the recursion
S0 = S,
Sî+1 = {u ∈Sî : p[Sî
u ] has more than one (irrational) member},
Së = T
î<ë Sî, if ë is a limit ordinal.
Each Sî is a tree on ù × κ and
ç < î =⇒Sç ⊇Sî
so that easily, for some ë,
Së+1 = Së;
we take
S∗= Së
for the least such ë.
The condition
R1(S, κ) ⇐⇒S is a tree on ù × κ & p[S] ̸= ∅
is ZF-absolute by the general properties of absoluteness and Mostowski’s Theo-
rem 8E.4, since
p[S] ̸= ∅⇐⇒{⟨⟨u, v⟩⟩: u, v are ﬁnite sequences on ù × κ and u, v ∈S
and v is a proper initial segment of u} is not wellfounded.

8G.1]
8G. Regularity results and inner models
417
But also
p[S] has more than one element
⇐⇒(∃u)(∃n)(∃î)(∃m)(∃ç)

ub(n, î) ∈S & ub(m, ç) ∈S
& n ̸= m
& p[Sub(n,î)] ̸= ∅
& p[Sub(m,ç)] ̸= ∅

,
so that the condition
R2(S, κ) ⇐⇒S is a tree on ù × κ
and p[S] has more than one element
is also ZF-absolute. Thus by the ZF-absoluteness of deﬁnition by transﬁnite recur-
sion 8E.5, the operation
(î, S) 7→Sî
is ZF-absolute.
The assertion
(∀s)(∃ë)[Së+1 = Së]
is a theorem of ZF which is easily expressible in L∈, so it must hold on all standard
models of suﬃciently many axioms in ZF. From this we infer easily that the operation
S 7→S∗= Së for the least ë such that Së+1 = Së
is also ZF-absolute.
Assume now the hypotheses of the lemma for a speciﬁc M |= ZF and a tree T on
ù × κ, T ∈M. From the discussion above we know that
î ∈M =⇒T î ∈M
and that for some ë ∈M,
T ë+1 = T ë = T ∗∈M.
If T ∗̸= ∅, then p[T] has a perfect subset as in the proof of 2C.2. It remains to show
that if T ∗= ∅, then p[T] ⊆M.
Assume T ∗= ∅and suppose that α ∈p[T], so that for some f : ù →κ, (α, f) ∈T,
i.e., for all n
 α(0), f(0), α(1), f(1), . . . , α(n −1), f(n −1)

∈T;
as in the proof of 2C.2 again, there must be a î such that (α, f) ∈[T î] \ [T î+1] and
consequently for some n,
u =
 α(0), f(0), . . . , α(n −1), f(n −1)

∈T î \ T î+1.
For this î, we have by the deﬁnition that
p[T î
u ] has exactly one element,
namely α.
Suppose now ϕ(S, κ) and ø(S, â) are formulas of L∈which deﬁne absolutely for
standard models of ZF the conditions R1(S, κ) and â ∈p[S]. We have
V |= ϕ(T î
u , κ),
hence also
M |= ϕ(T î
u , κ).

418
8. Metamathematics
[8G.2
But the sentence
(∀S)(∀κ)[ϕ(S, κ) →(∃â)ø(S, â)]
is obviously a theorem of ZF (at least if ϕ(S, κ) and ø(S, â) are chosen in the natural
way), so that it must hold in M. In particular,
M |= ϕ(T î
u , κ) →(∃â)ø(T î
u , â),
and thus there is some â ∈M so that
M |= ø(T î
u , â)
which implies â ∈T î
u , i.e., â = α and α ∈M.
⊣
In order to put down an elegant version of this result, let us call a pointset P ⊆X
κ-Suslin over (a transitive class) M, if κ ∈M and there is a tree T on ù × κ in M and
a ∆1
1 function
f : X →N
with ∆1
1 inverse such that
P(x) ⇐⇒f(x) ∈p[T].
8G.2. Mansﬁeld’s Perfect Set Theorem. If P is κ-Suslin over a standard model
M of ZF, then either P ⊆M or P has a non-empty perfect subset.
Proof. If x0 ∈P \M, then by the ZF-absoluteness of f−1, α0 = f(x0) ∈p[T]\M
and hence p[T] has a non-empty perfect subset F . Now f−1[F ] is an uncountable
Borel subset of P, so P has a non-empty perfect subset.

2(â0) and x0 /∈L[â0] for some
x0 ∈P, then P has a non-empty perfect subset.
In particular, if card(N ∩L[â0]) = ℵ0, then every uncountable Σ1
2(â0) set has a
non-empty perfect subset and
N ∩L[â0] = C2(â0) = the largest countable Σ1
2(â0) set.
⊣
We can consider this theorem a “lightface” improvement of 6G.10, since as we will
show in 8H.15, 8H.7,
(∃κ)[κ →(ℵ1)] =⇒(∀â)[card(N ∩L[â]) = ℵ0].
But the present result is much more appealing than 6G.10, because it seems to give an
explanation of why some Σ1
2(â) sets are countable and other are not: at least granting
that card(N ∩L[â]) = ℵ0, then for any Σ1
2(â) set P,
P is countable ⇐⇒P ⊆L[â].
We now turn to “lightface” versions of the other known regularity properties of Σ
e
1
2
sets, on the basis of the hypothesis (∀â)[card(N ∩L[â]) = ℵ0]. The key result is a
metamathematical theorem on approximating sets modulo a ó-ideal, a theorem quite
similar to 2H.1.
First some preliminary deﬁnitions and absoluteness computations.
Recall the coding of Borel sets by irrationals which we introduced in 7B and suppose
M is a transitive class, possibly an inner model of ZF. A Borel set P ⊆X is rational
over M if there is some α ∈M which is a code for P.
For each ordinal ë > ù, we deﬁne the sets C î
ë by recursion on î:
C 0
ë = {⟨⟨1, s⟩⟩: s ∈ù}
C î+1
ë
= C î
ë
S{⟨⟨2, a⟩⟩: a ∈C î
ë }
S{⟨⟨3, f⟩⟩: f : ç →C î
ë is a function with domain
some ç < ë and image in C î
ë },
C ì
ë = S
î<ì C î
ë if ì is a limit ordinal.
We let
Cë = S
î C î
ë
and we call the members of the class Cë codes for the ë-Borel sets. Notice that
ë ≤ë′ =⇒Cë ⊆Cë′.
For each space X and each a ∈Cë we deﬁne a pointset
Ba = B(a, ë, X) ⊆X
by the recursion
B(⟨⟨1, s⟩⟩, ë, X) = Ns(X) = the s’th basic nbhd of X,
B(⟨⟨2, a⟩⟩, ë, X) = X \ B(a, ë, X),
B(⟨⟨3, f⟩⟩, ë, X) = S
î<ç B
 f(î), ë, X

,
where in the last clause ç < ë and f : ç →Cë. It is clear how to express this deﬁnition
in the language of set theory by using recursion on î to deﬁne B : Cë →V on each
C î
ë ﬁrst. It is also immediate that
ë ≤ë′ & a ∈Cë =⇒B(a, ë, X) = B(a, ë′, X),

420
8. Metamathematics
[8G.5
so that the notation “Ba” is unambiguous once we ﬁx X and we know a ∈Cë for
some ë.
It is easy to prove (using the Axiom of Choice) that a set P ⊆X is Ba for some
a ∈Cë if and only if P is ë-Borel in the sense of Section 2E. We say that P is ë-Borel
over (an inner model of ZF) M if
P = Ba = B(a, ë, X)
for some a ∈Cë ∩M.
8G.5. Lemma. (i) The conditions
C(ë, a) ⇐⇒a ∈Cë,
P(ë, a, x) ⇐⇒a ∈Cë & x ∈B(a, ë, X)
are ZF-absolute.
(ii) There is a ZF-absolute operation
F : Cù+1 →N
such that for each a ∈Cù+1, F (a) is a Borel code of B(a, ù, X); similarly, there is a
ZF-absolute operation
G : N →V
such that if α is a Borel code of P ⊆X, then G(α) ∈Cù+1 and B
 G(α), ù, X

= P.
(iii) Let M be a standard model of ZF and let
ë∗= ℵM
1
= supremum{î ∈M : there is some bijection f : ù ֌
→î, f ∈M}.
A set P ⊆X is ë∗-Borel over M if and only if P is Borel rational over M.
(iv) If M is an inner model of ZF and P ⊆X is κ-Suslin over M, then P is (κ+ + 1)-
Borel over M, where
κ+ = least cardinal greater than κ.
(v) Every Σ1
2(â) pointset is (ℵ1 + 1)-Borel over L[â].
Proof. (i) and (ii) are proved by standard absoluteness arguments which we will
omit.
(iii) The assertion
(∀α)[a ∈Cℵ1 =⇒for some î < ℵ1, a ∈Cî+1]
is easily expressible in L∈and it is a theorem of ZF. Thus if M is a standard model of
ZF and ë∗= ℵM
1 , then (using (i))
a ∈Cë∗∩M =⇒for some ë < ë∗, a ∈Cî+1 ∩M.
At the same time, it is easy to deﬁne a ZF absolute operation
(f, î, a) 7→a∗= H(f, î, a),
such that whenever f : ù ֌
→î is a bijection of î with ù and a ∈Cî+1, then
a∗= H(f, î, a) ∈Cù+1 and Ba = Ba∗.
Now if a ∈Cë∗∩M with ë∗= ℵM
1 , choose ë < ë∗such that a ∈Cî+1 ∩M, choose
f ∈M, f : ù ֌
→î and take a∗= F (f, î, a) ∈M. Using (ii), this shows that
if P ⊆X is ë∗-Borel over M, then P is Borel rational over M and the converse is
immediate by (ii).

(iv) Suppose ﬁrst that T ∈M, T a tree on ù × κ. By the Sierpinski formulas
in 2F.1,
N \ p[T] = S
ë<κ+ Bë
u
where the sets Bë
u are deﬁned by a simple recursion on ë with u, κ, T as parameters,
so that in fact
a ∈Bë
u ⇐⇒R(α, ë, u, κ, T)
with some ZF-absolute R. It is easy to deﬁne a ZF-absolute operation G(ë, u, κ, ì, T)
so that for each ì > κ and each ë < ì, G(ë, u, κ, ì, T) is a code in Cì of Bë
u and then
H(ì, κ, T) =

ë, ⟨⟨2, G(ë, ∅, κ, ì, T)⟩⟩

is ZF-absolute and gives a code of p[T] in Cκ++1 when we substitute ì = κ+. Since
M |= ZF and κ, κ+, T ∈M, we have H(κ+, κ, T) ∈M and p[T] is (κ+ + 1)-Borel
over M.
In order to prove the results for κ-Suslin sets P ⊆X, ﬁx some ∆1
1 function
f : X →N
with ∆1
1 inverse so that the relation
Q(x, s) ⇐⇒f(x) ∈Ns
is ∆1
1. Now (ii) above and the Suslin-Kleene Theorem imply easily that there is a
ZF-absolute G(s, ì) such that for each s ∈ù and ì > ù, G(s, ì) is a code of f−1[Ns]
in Cì and from this we can get a further ZF-absolute operation G′(a, ì) such that
for each a ∈Cì, G′(a, ì) is a code in Cì of f−1[B(a, ì, N)]. If P = f−1
p[T]

with T ∈M and p[T] = B(a, κ+, N), then G′(a, κ+) is a code of P and hence P is
(κ+ + 1)-Borel over M.
⊣
Recall from 2H that a collection J of subsets of a space X is a ó-ideal if it is closed
under subsets and countable unions.
A ó-ideal J is deﬁnable over an inner model M of ZF if there exists some formula
ϕ(α, c) of L∈and some c ∈M, such that for all α ∈N ∩M,
α is the Borel code of some A ∈J ⇐⇒M |= ϕ(α, c).
8G.6. Lemma. (i) For each space X and each inner model M of ZF, the ideal of
meager subsets of X is deﬁnable over M.
(ii) If ì is a ó-ﬁnite Borel measure on X, then there is some αì ∈N such that whenever
αì ∈M |= ZF, then the ó-ideal Zì of subsets of X of ì-measure 0 is deﬁnable over M.
If ì is the Lebesgue measure on the reals, then Zì is deﬁnable over every inner model M
of ZF.
(iii) If J is deﬁnable over M, then there is a formula ø(α, c) of L∈and some c ∈M
such that if ë∗= ℵM
1 and a ∈Cë∗∩M, then
Ba ∈J ⇐⇒M |= ø(a, c).
Proof. By 4F.19, the condition
P(α) ⇐⇒α codes a meager Borel subset of X
is easily Π1
2 and hence ZF absolute. This establishes (i) and (ii) follows by a similar
computation.
To prove (iii), let ϕ(α, c) and c ∈M be such that
α codes a Borel set in J ⇐⇒M |= ϕ(α, c)

422
8. Metamathematics
[8G.7
and take ø(a, c) to be the formula expressing the condition
(∃î)(∃f)(∃α){f : ù ֌
→î is a bijection
& a ∈Cî+1
& a is the code of a Borel set in J
& F (f, î, a) = α},
where F is the ZF-absolute operation deﬁned as in the proof of 8G.5 such that with
f, î and a as above and α = F (f, î, a),
Bα = Ba
and where we deﬁne “α is the code of a Borel set in J” using the formula ϕ(α, c)
supplied by the deﬁnition.
⊣
The Approximation Theorem 2H.1 had the additional hypothesis that J is regular
from above.
Here we will work with ó-ideals J which satisfy the countable chain
condition, CCC, i.e., such that every uncountable collection of pairwise disjoint Borel
sets must contain sets in J. We must be a bit careful in formulating this condition in
arbitrary inner models of ZF.
A ó-ideal J satisﬁes the CCC in an inner model M of ZF, if there is a formula ø(a, c)
of L∈and some c ∈M such that:
(i) for ë∗= ℵM
1 and a ∈Cë∗∩M,
Ba ∈J ⇐⇒M |= ø(a, c),
(ii) M |= “for every function f : ì →Cℵ1,
if î, ç < ì & î ̸= ç =⇒Bf(î) ∩Bf(ç) = ∅,
then {î : Bf(î) /∈J} is countable”;
in turning the expression in quotes into a formal assertion in L∈here, we use the given
ø(a, c) to express Ba ∈J and we use a formula ϕ(x, a, ë, X) supplied by (i) of 8G.5
to express “x ∈Ba,” so that e.g.,
Bf(î) ∩Bf(ç) = ∅
is expressed by
¬(∃x)[ϕ
 x, f(î), ℵ1, X

& ϕ
 x, f(ç), ℵ1, X

].
Also, by “ℵ1” we mean the supremum of countable ordinals within M, so that a more
detailed version of (ii) would read
M |= “if ë = the least uncountable ordinal, then for every
f : ì →Cë, if î, ç < ì . . . etc.”
Notice that if J satisﬁes the CCC in M, then J is deﬁnable over M.
8G.7. Lemma. (i) For each X and each inner model M of ZF, the collection of meager
subsets of X satisﬁes the CCC in M.
(ii) If ì is a ó-ﬁnite Borel measure on X, then there is some αì ∈N such that whenever
αì ∈M |= ZF, then the ó-ideal Zì satisﬁes the CCC in M; if ì is the Lebesgue measure
on the reals, then Zì satisﬁes the CCC in every inner model M of ZF.
Proof is immediate because it is a theorem of ZF that these ideals satisfy the CCC,
so this assertion must hold in every model of ZF. (More precisely: write up a proof
of the CCC for these ideals, check what properties of the condition
P(α) ⇐⇒α codes a Borel set in J

8G.8]
8G. Regularity results and inner models
423
you use in the proof, verify that each M must satisfy the formal sentences expressing
these properties because of the absoluteness in the deﬁnition of P(α).)
⊣
Suppose now that M is an inner model of ZF and J is a ó-ideal on X which satisﬁes
the CCC in M. The set of points of X which are J-algebraic over M is deﬁned by
Alg(M, J) = AlgX (M, J)
= {x ∈X : for some a ∈M ∩Cù+1, Ba ∈J and x ∈Ba}.
The points in Alg(M, J) can be approximated in M, in the sense that they belong to a
“small” Borel set (i.e., a Borel set in J) with code in M.
Notice that if card(N ∩M) = ℵ0, then Alg(M, J) is a countable union of sets in J,
so it is in J. Of course, if N ⊆M, then Alg(M, J) is the union of all Borel sets in J
and is most likely all of X.
Let
Trans(M, J) = TransX (M, J) = X \ Alg(M, J)
be the set of points of X which are J-transcendental over M.
8G.8. The Approximation Theorem over Models of ZF. Let M be an inner model
of ZF, let J be a ó-ideal of subsets of X which satisﬁes the CCC in M and suppose
P ⊆X is ë-Borel over M, for any ë > ù. Then there exists a Borel set P∗which is
rational over M, such that(2)
P △P∗= (P \ P∗) ∪(P∗\ P) ⊆Alg(M, J).
Proof. Fix J and M which satisfy the hypotheses and let
ë∗= ℵM
1
as in 8G.5. The idea is to deﬁne an operation
a 7→a∗
such that if a ∈Cë ∩M, then a∗∈Cë∗∩M and
Ba △Ba∗⊆Alg(M, J).
To deﬁne the operation a 7→a∗we will work in M, i.e., we will perform a set theoretic
construction within the model M. All that this means is that in the deﬁnition below,
by “set” we mean “set in M” and all notions of set theory are interpreted within M.
The deﬁnition of a∗is by recursion on the least î such that a ∈C î
ë , but of course it
comes down to treating three cases.
(i) If a = ⟨⟨1, s⟩⟩for some s ∈ù, put a∗= a.
(ii) If a = ⟨⟨2, b⟩⟩for some b, put a∗= ⟨⟨2, b∗⟩⟩.
(iii) Suppose now a = ⟨⟨3, f⟩⟩, where f is a function, f : ç →Cë where ç < ë and
we may assume that for each î < ç,
 f(î)
∗has already been deﬁned.
Let us deﬁne ﬁrst a function
g : ℵ1 →ç

424
8. Metamathematics
[8G.8
by the following subsidiary recursion. (Caution. Since we are working within M,
actually g : ë∗= ℵM
1 →ç.) Put
g(0) = 0,
g(æ + 1) =

if one such î exists,
0 otherwise.
g(ì) = 0
if ì is a limit.
Caution: to make precise this deﬁnition, we ﬁrst construct some ZF-absolute oper-
ation H(a, h) such that whenever a ∈Cë and h : æ →Cë∗, we have
BH(a,h) = Ba \ S
í≤æ Bh(í)
and then we ask in the ﬁrst case whether

(∗)
by using the formula ø(d, c) and the object c ∈M supplied by the hypothesis that J
satisﬁes the CCC in M. As a result, the set in (∗) will be in J exactly when M thinks
that it is in J.
Notice now that since J satisﬁes the CCC in M, there must be some ordinal æ0 < ë∗,
such that
æ ≥æ0 →g(æ) = 0,
otherwise we would get ℵ1 disjoint Borel sets with none of them in J (as M sees
things). Pick the least such æ0 and put
a∗=


3,

⟨⟨æ,
 f
 g(æ)
∗⟩⟩: æ < æ0
	
.
This completes the deﬁnition of the operation a 7→a∗in M and we obviously have
for a ∈M,
a ∈Cë =⇒a∗∈Cë∗.
We now move outside M and show by induction on î that
a ∈C î
ë ∩M =⇒Ba △Ba∗⊆Alg(M, J).
Again the proof comes down to three cases and the ﬁrst two are completely trivial.
(iii) Suppose a = ⟨⟨3, f⟩⟩with f : ç →Cë with ç < ë and a∗= ⟨⟨3, f∗⟩⟩is deﬁned
as above.
If x ∈Trans(M, J) and x ∈Ba∗, then for some æ < æ0,
x ∈Bf∗(æ) = Bf

Conversely, if x ∈Ba, then let î be the least ordinal such that x ∈Bf(î) and assume
towards a contradiction that x ∈Trans(M, J) and x /∈Ba∗. Now we obviously cannot
have î = g(æ) for some æ < æ0, since in that case we would have by the induction
hypothesis x ∈Bf
 g(æ)
∗= Bf∗(æ) ⊆Ba∗; hence by the deﬁnition of f∗, if
æ1 = supremum{æ : g(æ) < î},

8G.9]

we must have g(æ1 + 1) ̸= î, i.e.,
M |= Bf(î)∗\ S

∗∈J.
(∗∗)
By the construction then, there is some d ∈Cë∗∩M such that
Bd = Bf(î)∗= S
í≤æ1 Bf
 g(í)
∗
and
Bd ∈J,
since the interpretation of (∗∗) was that M |= ø(d, c). But x ∈Bd, obviously, so
that x is a member of some J-set with code in M contradicting our assumption that
x ∈Trans(M, J).
⊣
The corollaries make the eﬀort worthwhile.
8G.9. Theorem. (i) Let J be the ó-ideal of all meager subsets of X and suppose
P ⊆X is Σ1
2(â0); then there exists a Borel set ˜P which is rational over L[â0] and such
that
P △˜P ⊆Alg(l[â0], J).
In particular, if card(N ∩L[â0]) = ℵ0, then P has the property of Baire.
(ii) Suppose ì is a ó-ﬁnite Borel measure on X which satisﬁes the CCC in L[â0] (e.g.,
if ì is the Lebesgue measure on R) and suppose P ⊆X is Σ1
2(â0); then there is a Borel
set ˜P which is rational over L[â0] such that
P △˜P ⊆Alg(L[â0], Zì).
In particular, if card(N ∩L[â0]) = ℵ0, then P is ì-measurable.

Proof is immediate from 8G.8 and the preceding lemmas.
⊣
The applications of these results to the higher Lusin pointclasses depend on the
connection between semiscales and trees which we established in 2B.1 and which we
now reformulate in a suitable notation.
Suppose Γ is a Spector pointclass closed under ∀N with ordinal
ä
e
= supremum{| ≤| :≤is a prewellordering of N is ∆
e
},
let G ⊆ù × N be universal in Γ and let ϕ = {ϕn}n∈ù be a Γ-scale on G. By 4C.14
we know that the length |ϕn| of each (regular) norm ϕn is ä

ϕn : G ։ ä

It is important to notice that although we will use the notation “TΓ” for this tree
associated with the pointclass Γ, actually TΓ depends on the particular choice of G and
ϕ. In case
Γ = Π1

8. Metamathematics
[8G.10
and under the hypothesis Det(∆

T2n+1 = TΠ1
2n+1.
When we think of trees as sets (members of V ) as in the next theorem, we should
(strictly speaking) use the notation
⟨⟨î, ç⟩⟩
for the set-theoretic pair, rather than the simpler
⟨î, ç⟩
which we have been using all along. It is not worth here in complicate notation by
insisting on this pedantic diﬀerence.
8G.10. Theorem. Let Γ be a Spector pointclass which is closed under ∀N and has the
scale property and let TΓ be the tree on ù ×ä

set G ⊆ù × N and Γ-scale ϕ on G; suppose P ⊆X is in ∃N Γ(â0), i.e.,
P(x) ⇐⇒(∃α)R(x, â0, α)
where R ∈Γ and suppose M is an inner model of ZF such that TΓ, â0 ∈M, e.g.,

(i) P is ä

(ii) Either P ⊆M or P has a non-empty perfect subset.
(iii) If J is a ó-ideal which satisﬁes the CCC in M, then there is a Borel set ˜P which
is rational over M and such that
P △˜P ⊆Alg(M, J);
if in addition card(N ∩M) = ℵ0, then P is J-measurable.
In particular, with Γ and TΓ as above, if
(∀â)

card(N ∩L[TΓ, â]) = ℵ0

then every pointset in ∃N Γ

has the property of Baire, it is absolutely measurable and if
uncountable, it has a non-empty perfect subset.
Proof. It is enough to prove (i) from which the rest follow by what we have already
established in this section.
Suppose ﬁrst A ⊆N and

“N ⊆L”.
By 5A.11 then, if N admits a Σ1

recursive in some â ∈C1, where C1 is the largest Π1

It is worth putting down an alternative version of 8G.1 and 8G.2 in terms of these

8G.13. Prove that if M is a standard model of ZF, T a tree on ù × κ, T ∈M and
p[T] has a member not in M, then p[T] has a non-empty perfect subset with code
in M.
Infer that every Σ1
2 set A ⊆N which has a nonconstructible member has a non-
empty perfect subset with code in L.
Hint. We showed in the proof of 8G.1 that if p[T] has a member not in M, then the
tree T ∗is not empty and T ∗∈M. Now interpret the proof of 2C.2 after that within
M, to get a perfect subset of p[T]; the code of this perfect subset is in M and it also
codes a perfect subset of p[T] in the world.
The second assertion follows easily.

Hint. Let C1 be the largest thin Π1
1 subset of 4F.4 and consider the ∗-game for C1
as we deﬁned this in the exercises of 6A, in which I plays ﬁnite (non-empty) sequences
s0 = a0, . . . , ak0−1,
s1 = ak0+1, . . . , ak1−1,
II plays integers
ak0, ak1, . . .
and I wins if the play
α = a0, . . . , ak0−1, ak0, ak0+1, . . .
is in C1. the game is determined since C1 is Π1
1 and by 6A.10, I cannot win it, so
II does; but then C1 is countable and by 6E.1, II has a ∆1
3 winning strategy ô. Now
the proof of 6A.11 makes it clear that every irrational in C1 is recursive in ô and hence
lies in ∆1
3. Finally, from 5A.11 it follows that each α ∈L is recursive in some â ∈C1,
so that each α ∈L is ∆1

The argument for the relativized case is similar.
⊣
In 8H.15, 8H.16 we will show that this strong result also follows from the large
cardinal hypothesis (∃κ)[κ →(ℵ1)].
We now turn to a brief study of the inner models associated with various nice
pointclasses. First a few basic absoluteness facts about the models L[T2n+1]; in the
statements of these results, we always assume tacitly that T2n+1 is the tree on ù ×ä

α1, . . . , αm ∈M,
V |= è(α1, . . . , αm) ⇐⇒M |= è(α1, . . . , αm).
Hint. Assume the hypotheses on T2n+1 and M and prove by induction on i ≤2n+2
that every Σ1

so assume α ∈M and

we must show that
M |= [(∃ó

From (1) and 8G.15 we know that
V |= (∀â)[è1(α, â) ↔¬è2(α, â)]
so that the set
A = {â : V |= è1(α, â)}
is ∆1

game deﬁne by A, so that
V |= (∃ó

by 8G.15 again

[8G.17
This is a typical application of the absoluteness result in 8G.15: the models L[T2n+1]
reﬂect enough of the properties of V to satisfy just a bit more determinacy than we
need to construct them.
The ﬁrst, important question about these models is their invariance, i.e., the question
whether L[T2n+1] depends on the particular choice of G and ϕ used in constructing
T2n+1. It was answered (positively) by Becker and Kechris in their seminal 1984,
after the ﬁrst edition of this book.(5) In the remaining exercises of this Section we will
establish some partial results in the direction of the Becker-Kechris Theorem which
were known in 1980 and are still interesting today, especially as they led to some basic
open problems. In particular, we will show that the set N ∩L[T2n+1] of irrationals in
L[T2n+1] is independent of the particular choice of T2n+1, in fact
N ∩L[T2n+1] = C2n+2
= the largest countable Σ1
2n+2 subset of N.
This is due to Harrington and Kechris (Kechris and Martin for n = 1), and we will
prove it in a sequence of results which are quite interesting in themselves. It will pay to
formulate these lemmas in a reasonably general context, since they have applications
to the study of many pointclasses other than Π1
2n+1.
A pointclass Γ resembles Π1
1 if the following two conditions hold.
(i) Γ is a Spector pointclass with the scale property and closed under ∀N .
(ii) For each α ∈N, if P ⊆X × Y is in ∆(α) and
Q(x) ⇐⇒Px = {y : P(x, y)} is not meager,
then Q is also in ∆(α).
It is clear that Π1
1 resembles Π1
1 by 4F.19 and that if Γ resembles Π1
1 so does
each relativization Γ(z). The next result gives a large stock of pointclasses which
resemble Π1
1.
8G.17. Suppose Γ is a Spector pointclass with the scale property and closed under
∀N and assume that there is some adequate pointclass Γ1 ⊆Γ such that
Γ = ∀N Γ1,
Γ1 is closed under ∃N and Σ1
1 ⊆Γ1. Assume also that Det(Γ
e
) holds and show that Γ
resembles Π1
1.
In particular, if Det(Π
e
1
2n+1) holds then Π1
2n+1 resembles Π1
1 and if Det(IND) holds,
then IND resembles Π1
1. (Kechris [1973].)
Hint. Show ﬁrst by a prewellordering argument that if P ∈∆and
P(x) ⇐⇒(∀α)R(x, α)
for some R ∈Γ, then actually R ∈∆
e
. (Let
R(x, α) ↔G(ε1, x, α)
where G is universal in Γ, letϕ be a Γ-norm on G and assuming towards a contradiction
that R is not in ∆
e
, check that
G(ε, y, â) ⇐⇒(∃x)

P(x) & (∃α)[¬(ε1, x, α) <∗
ϕ (ε, y, â)]

,
so that in that case G ∈¬Γ.) Similarly for P ∈∆(α).
Suppose now P ⊆X × Y is in ∆and choose R ⊆X × Y × N in ¬Γ1 such that

8G.18]
8G. Regularity results and inner models
431
P(x, y) ⇐⇒(∃α)R(x, y, α),
where Γ1 is the pointclass given by the hypothesis. By the remark above we also know
that R ∈∆
e
.
Claim:
Px is not meager
⇐⇒(∃A ⊆Y × N)

A is Σ1
1 & (∀y)(∀α)[A(y, α) =⇒R(x, y, α)]
& p[A] = {y : (∃α)A(y, α)} is not meager

.
For the non-trivial direction (=⇒) of the claim, notice that if Px is not meager, then
it has a non-meager Borel subset B. The relation
R′
x(y, α) ⇐⇒y ∈B & R(x, y, α)
is in ∆
e
, so it can be uniformized by some R∗
x ⊆R′
x in Γ
e
since Γ is scaled and then the
function f : B →Y × N with graph R∗
x is Baire-measurable by 6A.16. Using 2H.10,
ﬁnd some non-meager Borel set C ⊆B such that f ↾C is continuous and take
A = R∗
x ∩C × Y × N; this is the required Σ
e
1
1 subset of R′
x, since easily C = p[A].
Now the claim is proved and together with the key hypothesis ∃N Γ1 ⊆Γ1, it implies
easily that the relation Q is in ¬Γ. Since also
Q(x) ⇐⇒Px is not meager
⇐⇒(∃s)[Ns \ Px is meager],
we easily get that Q is also in Γ.
The argument is similar for P in ∆(α).
For the speciﬁc examples, take Γ1 = Σ1
2n for Π1
2n+1 and Γ1 = IND for IND.
⊣
The next result is the key lemma that we need.
8G.18 (The Kechris Perfect Set Lemma, Kechris [1973]). Suppose Γ resembles Π1
1,
A ⊆X is in ∆and not meager and
ϕ : A →Ordinals
is a ∆-norm on A and assume Det(Γ
e
). Prove that there is some ë∗and a non-empty
perfect set F with code in ∆such that
x ∈F =⇒ϕ(x) = ë∗.
In particular, if A ⊆X is in ∆and not meager, then A has a non-empty perfect
subset with code in ∆.
Hint. The second assertion follows immediately from the ﬁrst, taking ϕ(x) = 0.
For the ﬁrst assertion, argue ﬁrst using 5A.10 and the fact that all sets in ∆
e
have the
property of Baire that if
ø : B →Ordinals
is any ∆
e
-norm on a set B ∈∆
e
which is not meager, then for some ë the set
{x ∈B : ø(x) = ë}
must be non-meager.

8. Metamathematics
[8G.18
It will be enough to prove the result for A ⊆N, easily, so suppose ϕ is a ∆-norm on
A, put
ë∗= least ë such that {α ∈A : ϕ(α) = ë} is not meager,
A∗= {α ∈A : ϕ(α) = ë∗}
and notice that A∗is in ∆because Γ resembles Π1
1.
Consider the ∗-game for A∗deﬁned on page 224, in which I plays ﬁnite (non-empty)
sequences from ù
s0 = a0, . . . , ak0−1,
s1 = ak0+1, . . . , ak1−1,
· · ·
II plays single integers ak0, ak1, . . . and I wins if the play
α = a0, . . . , ak0−1, ak0, ak0+1, . . . , ak1−1, ak1, . . .
is in A∗. It is obviously enough to show that I has a winning strategy in ∆, since from
any strategy we can easily get a perfect subset of A∗with code in ∆.
Fix a ∆-scale ø = {øm} on A∗and put
ë0 = least ë such that {α ∈A∗: ø0(α) = ë} is not meager,
s0 = least s such that N(s) \ {α ∈A∗: ø0(α) = ë0} is meager,
A0 = {α ∈A∗: α ∈N(s0) & ø0(α) = ë0}
and have I start the game by playing the sequence s0 with code s0. (Recall here that if
s = ⟨a0, . . . , an−1⟩,
then
N(s) = {α ∈N : α(0) = a0, . . . , α(n −1) = an−1};
we are also using the fact that for each non-meager B with the property of Baire, there
must be some s such that N(s) \ B is meager.) In general, having deﬁned ëi, si, Ai
for i < m, I answers the move
a = akm−1
of II by setting
ëm = least ë such that {α ∈Am−1 : α(km−1) = a & øm(α) = ë}
is not meager,
sm = least s such that
N(s) \ {α ∈Am−1 : α(km−1) = a & øm(α) = ëm} is
meager,
Am = {α ∈Am−1 : α(km−1) = a & α ∈N(sm) & øm(α) = ëm}
and playing the sequence sm with code sm. It is clear (by induction) that each Ai is
not meager and that the unique point α ∈T
m Am which is the play must be in A∗,
using the fact that ø is a scale. Finally, it is not hard to check that this strategy for I is
in ∆, using the hypothesis that Γ resembles Π1
1.

In the computation below we will actually use a corollary of this which is worth
separate billing.

property: for every α ∈N there exists some ã ∈N such that ϕ(ã) = ë∗and α ∈∆(ã).
Hint. By the Kechris Perfect Set Lemma 8G.18, we can ﬁnd a perfect set F ⊆N
with code ε in ∆and a ë∗such that
ã ∈F =⇒ϕ(ã) = ë∗.
Using the method of 1A.2, 1A.3, we can easily get an injection
f : C ֌ F
of the Cantor set into F which is recursive in ε, so that for each α′ ∈C there is some
ã = f(α′) ∈F such that α′ ∈∆1
1(ε, ã)—because
α′(n) = m ⇐⇒(∃α)[f(α) = ã & α(n) = m].
The result follows because every α ∈N is recursive in some α′ ∈C and ∆1
1(ε, ã) ⊆∆(ã)
when ε ∈∆.

ϕ(x) = ϕ(x′) =⇒[P(x, y) ⇐⇒P(x′, y)].
If P is uniform in x, it clearly deﬁnes a relation on ë × Y which we will denote by the

now R′ is clearly uniform in x and in Γ and
P(x, y) ⇐⇒(∃α)R′(x, y, α),
so that we may assume (∗) holds with R uniform in x.
For each x, y consider the game G(x, y) where I plays â, II plays ã and

We claim that for x ∈S,
 ∀î < ϕ(x)

P(î, x) ⇐⇒II wins G(x, y);
from this the result will follow immediately, since
II wins G(x, y) ⇐⇒(∃ô)(∀â)T(â, [â] ∗ô, x, y)
and the expression on the right deﬁnes a relation in ∃N Γ.
If II wins G(x, y), then for any î < ϕ(x) have I play some â with ϕ

II responds with ã, then

Assume towards a contradiction that I wins G(x, y) but
 ∀î < ϕ(x)

P(î, y), and
let ó be a winning strategy for I. Imagine II playing irrationals of the form ⟨ó, ä⟩for
arbitrary ä to which I responds by ó ∗[⟨ó, ä⟩] ∈S and consider the norm on N
ø(ä) = ϕ(ó ∗[⟨ó, ä⟩]).
This is obviously a ∆(ó)-norm and the pointclass Γ(ó) resembles Π1
1, so by 8G.19
there must be some î with the following property: for each α, there is some ä with
ã(ä) = î and α ∈∆(ó, ä).
Now choose any x such that ϕ(x) = î and since
P(x, y) ⇐⇒(∃α)R(x, y, α) holds, choose α such that R(x, y, α), choose ä such that
ø(ó) = î and α ∈∆(ó, ä) and have II play ⟨ó, ä⟩. If â = ó ∗[⟨ó, ä⟩] is I’s response
then, we know that ð(â) ∈S and ϕ

have ¬R

Hint. Let G ⊆N × X × Y be universal in Γ, let ÷ : G ։ ä
e
be a Γ-norm on G and
with each
z = (ε, α, x, y) ∈N × N × X × Y
such that G(α, x, y) associate the set Az ⊆X × Y by
Az(x′, y′) ⇐⇒G(ε, x′, y′) & ÷(ε, x′, y′) ≤÷(α, x, y).
Each Az is obviously in ∆
e
, uniformly in z.
The relation
R1(z) ⇐⇒R1(ε, α, x, y)
⇐⇒G(α, x, y)
(1)
is clearly in Γ and so is the relation
R2(z) ⇐⇒R1(z) & Az is uniform in x′ (relative to the norm ϕ) and in
y′ (relative to the norm ø)
⇐⇒R1(z)
& (∀x′)(∀y′)[Az(x′, y′) =⇒(x′ ∈S & y′ ∈T)]
& (∀x′)(∀x′′)(∀y′)(∀y′′){[Az(x′, y′)
& ϕ(x′) = ϕ(x′′) & ø(y′) = ø(y′′)] =⇒Az(x′′, y′′)}.
With each z such that R2(z) holds, we associate the set of pairs of ordinals
Bz ⊆ë × ì
by
Bz(ç, î) ⇐⇒(∃x)(∃y)[x ∈S & ϕ(x) = ç & y ∈T & ø(y) = î & Az(x, y)]
⇐⇒(∀x)(∀y){[x ∈S & ϕ(x) = ç & y ∈T & ø(y) = î]
=⇒Az(x, y)}.
Conversely, suppose B ⊆ë × ì is bounded below ä
e
, i.e.,
B ⊆ë1 × ì1
where ë1 ≤ë, ë1 < ä
e
and ì1 ≤ì, ì1 < ä
e
; using AD now, the Coding Lemma (II) 7D.6
(applied to ¬Γ) implies directly that the set
B′ = {(x, y) : x ∈S & y ∈T & B


}
is in ∆
e
and hence by the Covering Lemma 4C.11, easily,
B′ = Az
with some z such that R2(z) holds and hence
B = Bz.
Proceeding with the computation, notice that the relation
R3(x, y, z) ⇐⇒x ∈S & y ∈T & R2(z) & Bz ⊆ϕ(x) × ø(y)
⇐⇒x ∈S & y ∈T & R2(z)

Az(x′, y′) =⇒[ϕ(x′) < ϕ(x) & ø(y′) < ø(y)]

is clearly in Γ and uniform in x (relative to ϕ) and in y (relative to ø).

is in Γ and uniform in x′ (relative to ϕ) and in y′ (relative to ø), so by the Harrington-

R4(î, ç, z)

& Bz ⊆ϕ(x) × ø(y) &
 ∀î < ϕ(x)
 ∃ç < ø(y)

Bz(î, ç).
Proceeding in the same way, by successive applications of the Harrington-Kechris
Theorem we show that the following relation is in ∃N Γ:
R6(x, y, z) ⇐⇒x ∈S & y ∈T & R2(z)
& Bz ⊆ϕ(x) × ø(y)
& Bz is the graph of an order-preserving one-to-one
function from ϕ(x) onto ø(y).
Using the remark above then, that by AD every subset of ϕ(x) × ø(y) is Bz for some
z such that R3(x, y, z), we ﬁnally get that
P(x, y) ⇐⇒x ∈S & y ∈T & there exists a one-to-one
order-preserving function from ϕ(x) onto ø(y)
⇐⇒(∃z){R3(x, y, z) & R6(x, y, z)}
is in ∃N Γ.
The argument for ϕ(x) < ø(y) is similar.

If Γ resembles Π1
1 and AD holds, we let
HΓ = L[Pϕ,G]
where ϕ, G are chosen as above. Notice that (by 4C.14) we can always ﬁnd such ϕ
and G and by 8G.22, which particular ϕ, G we choose is irrelevant. Notice also that
if Γ ⊆L(R) as in the case with Π1
2n+1 and IND, we need only assume that every set of
irrationals in L(R) is determined, as the whole construction of HΓ takes place within
the model L(R) by very simple absoluteness considerations.
For Γ = Π1
2n+1 we use the simpler notation
H2n+1 = HΠ1
2n+1.
One extension of 8G.22 is worth putting down.
8G.23 (Moschovakis). Suppose Γ resembles Π1
1 and
ø1 : S1 ։ ä

are regular Γ-norms on sets S1, . . . , Sn in Γ, put
Q(î1, . . . , în) ⇐⇒î1, . . . , în < ä

[ø1(x1) = î1 & · · · & øn(xn) = în & R(x1, . . . , xn)],
where R is an arbitrary pointset in ∃N Γ. Assume AD and prove that Q ∈HΓ.
Hint. The G¨odel wellordering of pairs of ordinals is deﬁned by
(î, ç) ≤(î′, ç′) ⇐⇒max(î, ç) < max(î′, ç′)
∨[max(î, ç) = max(î′, ç′) & î < î′]
∨[max(î, ç) = max(î′, ç′) & î = î′ & ç ≤ç′].
The initial segments of this wellordering of ON × ON are sets and hence by 8C.7,
easily, there is a ZF-absolute operation
ð2 : ON × ON ֌
→ON
such that
(î, ç) ≤(î′, ç′) ⇐⇒ð2(î, ç) ≤ð2(î′, ç′).

It is easy to check that ø is a regular Γ-norm, so if G ⊆ù × X × X is universal in
∃N Γ and
P(n, î) ⇐⇒(∃x)(∃y)[S(x) & S(y) & ø(x, y) = î & G(n, x, y)],
we know that
HΓ = L[P]
by 8G.22. But obviously
Q(î1, î2) ⇐⇒(∃x)(∃y){S(x) & S(y) & ø(x, y) = ð2(î1, î2)

Let us now turn to the relation between HΓ and the models L[TΓ] which we intro-
duced in 8G.10.
8G.24 (Moschovakis). Suppose Γ resembles Π1
1 and let
TΓ = TΓ,G,ϕ
be the tree associated with a universal set G ⊆ù × N in Γ and a Γ-scale ϕ on G as
in 8G.10. Assume AD and prove that
TΓ ∈HΓ
so that L[TΓ] ⊆HΓ.
Hint. This time take the G¨odel wellordering of all tuples of ordinals deﬁne by
(î1, . . . , în) ≤(ç1, . . . , çm) ⇐⇒max(î1, . . . , în) < max(ç1, . . . , çm)
∨[max(î1, . . . , în) = max(ç1, . . . , çm) & n < m]
∨[max(î1, . . . , în) = max(ç1, . . . , çm) & n = m
& the tuple (î1, . . . , în) precedes (î1, . . . , în) lexicographically]
and argue as before that for some ZF-absolute
ð : V ։ ON,
(î1, . . . , în) ≤(ç1, . . . , çm) ⇐⇒ð(⟨⟨î1, . . . , în⟩⟩) ≤ð(⟨⟨ç1, . . . , çm⟩⟩).
Choose a regular Γ-norm ϕ : S ։ ä

But of course T can be deﬁned directly from Q, so also T ∈HΓ.

For the case Γ = Π1
1, it is quite easy to check that
L[T1] = H1 = L,
see Kechris and Moschovakis [1972]. In general, for an arbitrary Γ which resembles
Π1
1 (and assuming AD), it was not known whether
L[TΓ] = HΓ
at the time of the ﬁrst edition of this book, although there were some positive results of
Martin for the special case Γ = Π1
3. It was an important question, because a positive
answer implies the invariance of L[TΓ] from the arbitrary choices of G and ϕ in its
deﬁnition—a very strong invariance property of deﬁnable scales. It is the main result
of Becker and Kechris [1984].(5) Here we show only that for Γ as above
N ∩L[TΓ] = N ∩HΓ
(∗)
= the largest countable ∃N Γ-subset of N.
First the easy half.
8G.25. Suppose Γ resembles Π1
1 and assume AD.
Show that there is a largest
countable set CΓ ⊆N in ∃N Γ and for any choice of TΓ
CΓ ⊆L[TΓ] ⊆HΓ.

Hint. Show ﬁrst that for each X, there is a largest countable subset of X in Γ as
in 6E.9 and then proceed as in 6E.10 to get a largest countable subset CΓ ⊆N in ∃N Γ.
By 8G.10 then, CΓ ⊆L[TΓ].
⊣
To show (∗) above it enough to prove that the pointset N ∩HΓ is in ∃N Γ. The
computation is very similar to that in the proof of 8G.21, only a bit more elaborate.
Fix a pointclass Γ which resembles Π1
1 and choose a regular Γ-norm
ϕ : S ։ ä
e
where S ⊆X. Fix also a good universal G ⊆ù × X in ∃N Γ, so that
HΓ = L[P],
where
P(n, î) ⇐⇒(∃x)[x ∈S & ϕ(x) = î & G(n, x)].
We will obviously code ordinals below ä
e
using ϕ.
We also need to code bounded n-ary subsets of ä
e
, where B ⊆nä
e
is bounded if there
is some ë < ä
e
such that
B(î1, . . . , în) =⇒î1, . . . , în < ë.
To do this, choose for each n a universal set
Gn ⊆N × X n
in Γ, let
÷n : Gn ։ ä
e
be a Γ-norm, let
Sn = {(x0, ε, α, x1, . . . , xn) : x0 ∈S & Gn(α, x1, . . . , xn)}
and for each
z = (x0, ε, α, x1, . . . , xn)
put
Az = {(x′
1, . . . , x′
n) : G(ε, x′
1, . . . , x′
n)
& ÷n(ε, x′
1, . . . , x′
n) ≤÷n(α, x′
1, . . . , x′
n)
& ϕ(x′
1) < ϕ(x0) & · · · & ϕ(x′
n) < ϕ(x0)}.
Clearly each Az is in ∆

and the relation
U n(z) ⇐⇒Az is uniform in x′

⇐⇒z ∈Sn & (∀x′

1 ) & · · · & ϕ(x′

n )]
=⇒Az(x′′
1 , . . . , x′′
n )}
is in Γ. With each z ∈U n we associate the set
Bz = {(î1, . . . , în) : (∃x′
1) · · · (∃x′
n)[ϕ(x′
1) = î1 & · · ·
& ϕ(x′
n) = în & Az(x′
1, . . . , x′

which is obviously bounded, since if z = (x0, ε, α, x1, . . . , xn), then
Bz(î1, . . . , în) =⇒î1, . . . , în < ϕ(x0).

A restricted second order relation on ä

R(î1, . . . , în, B1, . . . , Bm),
where each îi ranges over ä

some integer kj. With each such R we associate the pointset

∃N Γ in the codes if R# is in ∃N Γ.
8G.27. Suppose Γ resembles Π1

that the collection of restricted second order relations on ä

Hint. The computations are all trivial, using of course, the Harrington-Kechris
Theorem 8G.20.
⊣
This is the general version of the Harrington-Kechris Theorem that we need. In
the results below we assume tacitly that the codings are relative to a ﬁxed choice of

8G.28. Suppose Γ resembles Π1
1, assume AD and prove that the relation
R(A, B) ⇐⇒A ∈L(B)
on bounded n-ary subsets of ä
e
is in ∃N Γ in the codes.
Hint. This is a set-theoretic computation, very much like that of N ∩L in 8F.7.
Using unary A, B for simplicity, check ﬁrst by a Skolem-L¨owenheim argument that
A ∈L(B) ⇐⇒(∃ë < ä
e
)(∃ì < ä
e
)[A ⊆ë & B ⊆ë & ë < ì & A ∈Lì(B)].
By 8F.1, next, choose a formula ϕL(x, ì, y) and a ﬁnite T0 ⊆ZF such that for all
standard models M of T0, if A, B, ì ∈M then
A ∈Lì(B) ⇐⇒M |= ϕL(A, ì, B).

Hint. Fix a regular Γ-norm
ϕ : S ։ ä
e
and a universal set G ⊆ù × X and put
P(n, î) ⇐⇒(∃x)[x ∈S & ϕ(x) = î & G(n, x)]
so that HΓ = L[P].
Use ﬁrst a Skolem-L¨owenheim argument and the regularity of ä

A ∈L[P] ⇐⇒(∃ë < ä

Suppose now
G(n, x) ⇐⇒(∃â)G1(n, x, â)
where G1 is in Γ and ﬁx a Γ-norm
ø1 : G1 ։ ä

T(n, x) ⇐⇒x ∈S & (∃â)G1(n, x, â)
and on T deﬁne the norm
ø(n, x) = inﬁmum{ø1(n, x′, â) : x′ ∈S & ϕ(x′) = ϕ(x) & G1(n, x, â)}.
It is clear that ø is an ∃N Γ-norm on T and it is uniform on n ∈ù, x ∈S relative to
ϕ, so we can deﬁne
ø(n, î) = ø(n, x), for any x ∈S such that ϕ(x) = î.
Finally put
Pë,ì(n, î) ⇐⇒î < ë < ì & ø(n, î) < ì
and let
Q(ë, ì, n, î) ⇐⇒Pë,ì(n, î).

The key to the proof is that both Q and ¬Q are in ∃N Γ in the codes.
Proof that Q is in ∃N Γ in the codes is quite easy. We must show that
Q#(u, v, a, x) ⇐⇒u, v, a, x ∈S & ϕ(x) < ϕ(u) < ϕ(v)
& (∃n)[ϕ(a) = n & ø(n, x) < ϕ(v)]
is in ∃N Γ and only the last clause here needs any computation,
ϕ(n, x) < ϕ(v) ⇐⇒(∃x′)(∃â)[ϕ(x′) = ϕ(x)
& G1(n, x′, â) & ø1(n, x′, â) < ϕ(v)].
(We will omit the computation of “ϕ(a) = n” which involves saying that exactly n
points precede a in ϕ.)
Proof that ¬Q is in ∃N Γ. Compute:
(¬Q)#(u, v, a, x) ⇐⇒u, v, a, x ∈S
&

¬

ϕ(x) < ϕ(u) < ϕ(v) & (∃n)[ϕ(a) = n]

∨(∃n)

ϕ(a) = n & ¬
 ø(n, x) < ϕ(v)
	
.
For the non-trivial last clause, notice that for v ∈S,
¬
 ø(n, x) < ϕ(v)

⇐⇒(∃m)(∃z)(∃ã){G1(m, z, ã) & ø1(m, z, ã) = ϕ(v)
& (∀x′)(∀â)[ϕ(x) = ϕ(x′) =⇒(m, z, ã) ≤∗
ø1 (n, x′, â)]}
which establishes by 8G.21 that this clause and hence (¬Q)# is in ∃N Γ.
Claim: if A is bounded, then
A ∈L[P] ⇐⇒(∃ë < ä
e
)(∃ì < ä
e
)[A ∈L(Pë,ì)].
(2)
To show this in the direction (=⇒), choose ë by (1) so that A ∈L(P ∩ù × ë) and
let
ì = supremum{ø(n, î) : T(n, î) & î < ë};
since ä
e
is regular, we have ì < ä
e
and then clearly
P ∩(ù × ë) = Pë,ì.
For the other direction notice that since Q is in ∃N Γ in the codes, then 8G.23 implies
that Q ∈HΓ and hence each Pë,ì ∈HΓ and L(Pë,ì) ⊆HΓ.
Finally, since both Q and ¬Q are in ∃N Γ in the codes, so is the relation on a
bounded set B ⊆ù × ä
B = Pë,ì ⇐⇒(∀n, î ∈B)Q(ë, ì, n, î)
& (∀n, î < ë)[Q(ë, ì, n, î) =⇒B(n, î)]
and hence so is the relation
A ∈HΓ ⇐⇒(∃B)(∃ë)(∃ì)[B = Pë,ì & A ∈L(B)].
This completes the proof of (i). To prove (ii) now, simply compute
α ∈HΓ ⇐⇒(∃A)

A ∈L[P] & (∀n)(∀m)[α(n) = m ⇐⇒A(n, m)]

and check that the deﬁnition of “in ∃N Γ in the codes” easily implies now that this is
in ∃N Γ.

Finally, N ∩HΓ is wellorderable by 8F.12, hence countable by 7D.4, hence contained
in L[TΓ] by 8G.10.
⊣
The same method yields easily the next basic result about these models.
8G.30. Suppose G resembles Π1
1 and assume AD. (i) Show that the set
CΓ = N ∩HΓ
admits an ∃N Γ-good wellordering.
(ii) Show that
HΓ |= “2ℵ0 = ℵ1”.
(iii) In the special case Γ = Π1
2n+1 and granting DC, show that C2n+2 admits a
Σ1
2n+2-good wellordering and
H2n+1 |= “N admits a Σ1
2n+2-good wellordering of rank ℵ1”.
(Kechris [1975].)
Hint. For (i), use 8F.12 to get a canonical wellordering ≤ë,ì for each L(Pë,ì) in the
notation of 8G.29 and on CΓ deﬁne the wellordering
α ≤Γ â ⇐⇒[α ∈Lî(Pë,ì) for some triple ⟨⟨î, ì, î⟩⟩such that for every
smaller triple ⟨⟨ë′, ì′, î′⟩⟩(in the lexicographic ordering)
â /∈Lî′(Pë′,ì′)]
∨[for the least triple ⟨⟨ë, ì, î⟩⟩such that Lî(Pë,ì) contains
both α and â, Lî(Pë,ì) thinks that α ≤ë,ì â].
Here we only look at triples ⟨⟨ë, ì, î⟩⟩such that Lî(Pë,ì) satisﬁes enough axioms of ZF
to decide correctly the formula deﬁning ≤ë,ì. the computation that this ≤Γ is in ∃N Γ
and ∃N Γ-good is similar to that in the proof of 8G.29. They key of course, is that
α ≤Γ â & â ∈Lî(Pë,ì) =⇒α ∈Lî(Pë,ì);
compare the proof of 8F.7.
To prove (ii), put
P(â, ã) ⇐⇒â ∈CΓ & (∀n)[(ã)n <Γ â] & (∀ä <Γ â)(∃n)[ä = (ã)n]
where ≤Γ is the ∃N Γ-good wellordering of CΓ. Clearly P is in ∃N Γ and since (in V )
CΓ is countable, we have
(∀â ∈CΓ)(∃ã)P(â, ã).
Let P∗⊆P uniformize P is ∃N Γ and notice that P∗⊆N × N is countable so that
P∗⊆HΓ; thus for each â ∈CΓ there is some ã ∈CΓ which enumerates {ä : ä <Γ â},
so that within HΓ every initial segment of the wellordering <Γ has countable length. This
means precisely that
HΓ |= “the length of <Γ is ℵ1”,
so that in HΓ we have the Continuum Hypothesis.
(iii) is immediate by a small absoluteness argument.

Kechris and Moschovakis [1978b], Kechris [1975] and Becker [1978].
The more
interesting models L[TΓ] and HΓ for arbitrary Γ (resembling Π1
1) have also been
studied extensively since 1980. The main results are the invariance of L[TΓ] in Becker
and Kechris [1984] (cited above), and Steel’s subsequent proof of
HΓ |= GCH
under suitable large cardinal hypotheses. This has been one of the more spectacular
applications of inner model theory to descriptive set theory.(5)
A basic reason for looking at these various “partially playful universes” was the
desire to obtain consistency and independence results about determinacy hypotheses.
Here is one early example:

2n+2-good wellordering of N of rank ℵ1 and this implies easily as in 5A.6 that there
is an uncountable, thin Π1
2n+1 set in this model, which violates Det(Σ
e
1
2n+1) by 6A.12.⊣
In this connection, it is worth pointing out that Martin has shown that (granting
DC)
Det(∆
e
1
2n) =⇒Det(Σ
e
1
2n),
see his forthcoming Martin [20??].
Consider also the prewellordering property in the model HΓ. It is clear from the
proof of 5A.3, that the existence of a Σ1
2n+2-good wellordering of rank ℵ1 implies that
for each m ≥2n + 2, Σ
e
1
m is normed, so that using H2n+1 |= Det(∆
e
1
2n), we infer that in
H5 (for example) the circled pointclasses in Diagram 8G.1 are all normed.
The corresponding diagram for HIND has inﬁnitely many “teeth” since
HIND |= PD;
but in HIND we have, of course, a canonical wellordering of the universe and (it is easy
to see that) the restriction of this wellordering to N is in fact deﬁnable ( inductive) and
of rank ℵ1. This model, incidentally satisﬁes a good deal of absoluteness of analytical
statements, see Moschovakis [1978].
Using forcing and granting AD, one can show that for any pointclass Γ which
resembles Π1
1, if ë is any ordinal which is countable (in V ), then
HΓ |= 2ë = ë+.

8. Metamathematics
[8G.32
A much easier consequence of constructibility theory is that
ë ≥ä
e
=⇒HΓ |= 2ë = ë+.
As we mentioned above, the full Generalized Continuum Hypothesis for these models
was established later by Steel.(5)
It is also not hard to see that if
ë = ℵ1 = the least ordinal uncountable (in V ),
then for any such Γ,
HΓ |= “ë is strongly inaccessible”.
Actually,
HΓ |= “ë is measurable”
and the same is true for ë = ℵ2 (Moschovakis).
The study of these fascinating inner models is one of the most intriguing research
areas in the theory of determinacy, and it was still in its infancy when this book was
ﬁrst published. We add here just one more result which is quite easy to show by the
methods we have established.
8G.32. Suppose Γ resembles Π1
1, assume AD and let A ⊆ä
e
n be bounded. Prove
that A ∈HΓ if and only if there is a regular Γ-norm ϕ : S ։ ä

and an ordinal ë < ä
e
, such that
[x ∈S, x1, . . . , xn ∈S & ϕ(x) = ë, ϕ(x1) = î1, . . . , ϕ(xn) = în]
=⇒[A(î1, . . . , în) ⇐⇒R(x, x1, . . . , xn)].
8H. On the theory of indiscernibles(4)
In this section we will develop just enough of the celebrated theory of indiscernibles
in L to allow us to prove the following important theorem of Martin and Solovay
(improved in part by Mansﬁeld).
If there exists a measurable cardinal, then every Π1
2 set admits a ∆1
3-scale into an
ordinal
uù ≤ℵù;
if in addition the Axiom of Choice holds, then
uù < ℵ3,
so that every Σ
e
1
3 set is ℵ2-Suslin.
Together with results we have already proved and assuming the Axiom of Choice
and that every set in L(R) is determined, this implies easily
ä
e
1
3 = (ℵù+1)L(R) ≤ℵ3,
i.e., ä
e
1
3 is the ordinal which appears within L(R) to be the (ù + 1)’st cardinal—but in
V , actually ä
e
1
3 ≤ℵ3.
Another consequence (granting a measurable cardinal and the Axiom of Choice) is
that every Σ
e
1
3 set is the union of ℵ2 Borel sets and (assuming further Det(∆
e
1
2)) every Σ
e
1
4
set is the union of ℵ3 Borel sets.
Extension of these elegant results to the higher Lusin pointclasses is one of the most
challenging and fascinating open problems of descriptive set theory.

8H. On the theory of indiscernibles
447
The basic notions of the theory of indiscernibles are model-theoretic and it is useful
to explain them in a general setting.
Consider ﬁrst the theory
ZFL = ZF + “V = L”
which extends Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory by the (formal sentence of L∈expressing)
the Axiom of Constructibility and let
x ≤y
be a formula of L∈which deﬁnes the canonical wellordering of L,
x < y ⇐⇒x ≤y & ¬(x = y).
It is clear that if A = (A, E) is any model of ZFL, not necessarily a standard model,
then
A |= “{(x, y) : x ≤y}” is an ordering
(1)
and for any formula ø(z1, . . . , zn, y),
(2)
A |= (∀z1) · · · (∀zn)

(∃y)ø(z1, . . . , zn, y)
→(∃y)

ø(z1, . . . , zn, y) & (∀x)[x < y →¬ø(z1, . . . , zn, y)]
	
;
this is simply because these formal sentences are all theorems of ZFL and hence they
are true in every model of ZFL.
Let us call a theory (a set of sentences) T in a language L = Lu good (relative to a
formula x < y) if T has a model and if every model A of T satisﬁes (1) and (2) above.
We will assume for simplicity that there are no function symbols or constants in L.
Another good theory which we will use is
ZFL[ ˙α] = ZF + “ ˙α is the graph of a function on ù to ù” + V = L[ ˙α];
this is in the language L∈[ ˙α] obtained by adding to L∈a binary relation symbol ˙α
meant to represent the graph of some irrational α and its axioms express precisely the
assertion that every set is constructible from α. It is clear that ZFL[ ˙α] is good relative
to the formula deﬁning the canonical wellordering of L[α]. the models of ZFL[ ˙α] are
of the form
A = (A, E, α)
where E ⊆A × A and α ⊆A × A interpret ∈and ˙α respectively.
If A = (A, -) is any model of a good theory T, let
x ≤A y ⇐⇒A |= x ≤y
be the canonical ordering on A and call A wellfounded if ≤A is a wellordering. It is
clear from 8F.4 and 8F.22 (using Mostowski collapsing) that every wellfounded model
of ZFL is isomorphic to some
(Lë, ∈)
and every wellfounded model of ZFL[ ˙α] is isomorphic to some
(Lë[ ˙α], ∈, α),
where α ∈N and ë is limit.

8. Metamathematics
[8H.1
Let us now ﬁx a good theory T. With each formula ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn, ) whose free
variables are among the ﬁrst n +1 variables in our standard list v0, v1, . . . and in which
vn actually occurs free, we associate the formal term
ô(v1, . . . , vn) = ìv0ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn)
which intuitively deﬁnes the least v0 such that ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn, ). Of course, these terms
are not in the language L of T, but we can easily interpret them by partial functions
on each model A = (A, -) of T:
[ìv0ϕ(v0, x1, . . . , xn)]A↓⇐⇒A |= (∃v0)ϕ(v0, x1, . . . , xn),
[ìv0ϕ(v0, x1, . . . , xn)]A = the unique y ∈A such that
A |= ϕ(y, x1, . . . , xn) & (∀z < y)¬ϕ(z, x1, . . . , xn).
We will say that the partial function
ôA(x1, . . . , xn) = [ìv0ϕ(v0, x1, . . . , xn)]A
is deﬁnable by a term in A.
Moreover, we can easily interpret substitutions of these terms into formulas of L as
abbreviations of formulas,
ø
 ìv0ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn), x1, . . . , xm

⇐⇒(∃y){ϕ(y, v1, . . . , vn) & (∀z < y)¬ϕ(z, v1, . . . , vn)
& ø(y, x1, . . . , xm)},
where the variable y is chosen diﬀerentfrom all the variables occurring inø(w, x1, . . . , xn)
to avoid conﬂicts in interpretation. As another example,
ìv0ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) = ìv0ø(v0, v1, . . . , vm)
is an abbreviation of
(∃v0){ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) & (∀z < v0)¬ϕ(z, v1, . . . , vn)
& ø(v0, v1, . . . , vm) & (∀z < v0)¬ø(z, v1, . . . , vm)}
where z is any variable not occurring in ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn), ø(v0, v1, . . . , vm).
If A = (A, -) is a model of T and B ⊆A, put
B∗= {ôA(x1, . . . , xn) : x1 <A x2 <A · · · <A xn, x1, . . . , xn ∈B
and ô(v1, . . . , vn) = ìv0ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) is a term such that
ôA(x1, . . . , xn)↓}
and let B∗= (B∗, -) be the substructure of A obtained by restricting all the relations
of A to B∗.
We say that B generates A if
A = B∗.
8H.1. Lemma. If A = (A, -) is a model of a good theory T and ∅̸= B ⊆A, then B∗
is an elementary substructure of A.
Proof. As in the proof of the Skolem-L¨owenheim Theorem 8A.4, we show by
induction on the length of a formula ϕ(x1, . . . , xn), that if x1, . . . , xn ∈B∗, then
B∗|= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒A |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn).

8H. On the theory of indiscernibles

The only non-trivial case is when we consider formulas that start with a quantiﬁer,
say the formula
(∃w)÷(s, t, w),
where we have taken only two free variables to simplify notation. We must show that
if s, t ∈B∗and
A |= (∃w)÷(s, t, w),
then there is some w ∈B∗such that A |= ÷(s, t, w), so that by the induction hypothesis,
B∗|= (∃w)÷(s, t, w).
We have
s = ôA(x1, . . . , xn) = [ìv0ϕ(v0, x1, . . . , xn)]A,
t = óA(y1, . . . , ym) = [ìv0ø(v0, y1, . . . , ym)]A
where x1 <A · · · <A xn, y1 <A · · · <A ym are increasing sequences in B. Let z1 <A
z2 <A · · · <A zk be an increasing enumeration of the ﬁnite set {x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , ym},
so that
xi = zai,
yj = zbj
for suitable integers ai (1 ≤i ≤n), bj ( 1 ≤j ≤m) and put
ñ(v1, . . . , vk) = ìv0÷
 ìv0ϕ(v0, va1, . . . , van), ìv0ø(v0, vb1, . . . , vbm), v0

,
where of course, the formula deﬁning ñ(v1, . . . , vk) must be “unabbreviated” as above,
using variables that will not conﬂict with v0, v1, . . . , vk. Clearly now
w = ñA(z1, . . . , zk)

is in B∗and A |= ÷(s, t, w).
⊣
In the future we will often omit the details of such arguments where one has to fuss
with renumbering variables, as they are quite routine.
Suppose again that A is a model of T and I ⊆A is a a subset of the domain A.
We say that I is homogeneous in A (a set of indiscernibles in A) if for each formula
ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) and every two n-tuples of increasing members of I ,
x1, . . . , xn,
y1, . . . , yn ∈I,
x1 <A x2 <A · · · <A xn,
y1 <A y2 <A · · · <A yn,
we have
A |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒A |= ϕ(y1, . . . , yn).
This is the key notion of the theory of indiscernibles and it is obviously related to
the notion of a homogeneous set of ordinals (relative to a partition) with which we
worked in Section 6G.
We will be dealing with pairs
(A, I ),
where A = (A, -) is a model of T and I ⊆A is homogeneous in A. For each such pair,
let
∥I ∥A = the order-type of the ordering {(x, y) : x, y, ∈I, x ≤A y}

450
8. Metamathematics
[8H.2
and deﬁne the character of (A, I ) by
Φ = Char(A, I ) = {ϕ(v1, . . . , vn) : ϕ(v1, . . . , vn) is a formula whose free
variables are among v1, . . . , vn and for some
x1 <A x2 <A · · · <A xn, x1, . . . , xn ∈I ,
A |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn)}.
We are allowing here n = 0 so that the collection of formulas Φ contains all the
sentences true in A.
Mostly, we will work with pairs (A, I ) where I is wellordered by ≤A, so that ∥I ∥A is
some ordinal ë. One should be careful, however, because it may happen that ∥I ∥A is
an ordinal but A is not a wellfounded structure, i.e., the entire set A is not wellordered
by ≤A.
We are now ready to state and outline a proof of the basic result in the so-called
Ehrenfeucht-Mostowski theory.
8H.2. Theorem. Suppose Φ is a collection of formulas in the language of a good
theory T and assume that there exists a pair (A, I ) such that A is a model of T, I is an
inﬁnite homogeneous set in A and
Φ = Char(A, I ).
Then for each inﬁnite, limit ordinal ë, we can deﬁne a pair (Aë, Ië) (which depends only
on Φ) so that the following hold:
(i) Aë is a model of T, Ië is homogeneous in Aë, Ië generates Aë and
∥Ië∥Aë = ë.
(ii) Char(Aë, Ië) = Φ.
(iii) If (B, J) is any pair where B = (B, -) is a model of T, J ⊆B is homogeneous in
B and generates B and Char(B, J) = Φ and if
f : J ֌ Ië
is any order-preserving injection, then there is a unique extension
f∗: B →Aë
which is an elementary imbedding of B into Aë, i.e., for each formula ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) and
x1, . . . , xn ∈B,
B |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒Aë |= ϕ
 f∗(x1), . . . , f∗(xn)

.
(iv) With the same hypotheses as in (iii), if f : J ֌
→Ië is in fact an order preserving
bijection of J with Ië, then f∗is an isomorphism of B with Aë.
(v) The following three conditions are equivalent:
(a) Each Aë is a wellfounded model of T (i.e., ≤A is a wellordering).
(b) For each countable ë, Aë is wellfounded.
(c) For some uncountable ë, Aë is wellfounded.
Proof. The idea is to think of the ordinals below ë as the indiscernibles in the model
which we will construct, so every member of this model will be of the form
x = ôAë(î1, . . . , în) = [ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în)]Aë

8H.2]
8H. On the theory of indiscernibles
451
for some formula ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) and some î1 < î2 < · · · < în < ë. We can then
think of the tuple
 î1, . . . , în, ìv0ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn)

as a name of [ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în)]Aë (still to be constructed) and deﬁne ﬁrst the
collection of names
Bë =
 î1, . . . , în, ìv0ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn)

: î1 < î2 < · · · < în < ë
and the formula (∃v0)ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) ∈Φ
	
.
There is an obvious equivalence relation ∼on Bë (names are equivalent when they
name the same object) which is easiest to deﬁne in the special case when the ordinals
of the names are far apart. For example, if
î1 < î2 < ç1 < ç2 < ç3,
put
 î1, î2, ìv0ϕ(v0, v1, v2)

∼
 ç1, ç2, ç3, ìv0ø(v0, v1, v2, v3)

⇐⇒ìv0ϕ(v0, v1, v2) = ìv0ø(v0, v3, v4, v5) ∈Φ
⇐⇒whenever A = (A, -) |= T, I ⊆A is homogeneous in A,
Char(A, I ) = Φ and x1 <A x2 <A y1 <A y2 <A y3 are all
in I , then A |= ìv0ϕ(v0, x1, x2) = ìv0ø(v0, y1, y2, y3).
In the general case, let ë1 < ë2 < · · · < ëk be an increasing enumeration of the set
{î1, . . . , în, ç1, . . . , çm} so that
îi = ësi ,
çj = ëtj,
and put
 î1, . . . , în, ìv0ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn)

∼
 ç1, . . . , çm, ìv0ø(v0, v1, . . . , vm)

⇐⇒ìv0ϕ(v0, vs1, . . . , vsn) = ìv0ø(v0, vt1, . . . , vtm) ∈Φ
⇐⇒whenever A = (A, -) |= T, I ⊆A is homogeneous in A,
Char(A, I ) = Φ and z1 <A z2 <A · · · <A zk are all in I ,
then A |= ìv0ϕ(v0, zs1, . . . , zsn) = ìv0ø(v0, zt1, . . . , ztm).
It is now easy to prove that ∼is an equivalence relation on Bë, using the hypothesis
that there exists some pair (A, I ) with A |= T, I inﬁnite and homogeneous in A and
Char(A, I ) = Φ.
The domain of Aë will be then
Aë = Bë/ ∼
= all equivalence classes of members of Bë under ∼.
Similarly,
Ië =
 î, ìv0(v0 = v1)

: î < ë
	
,
where [–] is the equivalence class of –, so that Ië is naturally ordered with order-type
ë and we can identify it with ë for the proof.

The same idea will work for relation symbols of more arguments, except that we will
have to indulge in some renumbering of variables in the deﬁnition, as we did (in eﬀect)
with = above. These relation are easily well-deﬁned in Aë, although we deﬁne them to
begin with via representatives of equivalence classes—that argument too uses the fact
that Φ = Char(A, I ) for some suitable pair.
At this point we have a structure Aë = (Aë, −) and a set Ië ⊆Aë and it is obvious
that the truth of formal sentences in Aë can be computed by determining whether
various formulas are in Φ. The precise fact that we need is as follows.
Lemma. Suppose ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) is a formula and
x1 =

is a sequence of names in Bë with corresponding equivalence classes x1, . . . , xn, and let
ë1 < ë2 < · · · < ëk be an increasing enumeration of the ﬁnite set
{îi
j : 1 ≤i ≤n, 1 ≤j ≤mi}
so that with a suitable choice of integers a(i, j),
îi
j = ëa(i,j)
(1 ≤i ≤n, 1 ≤j ≤mi).
Then
Aë |= ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) ⇐⇒ϕ

. . . , ìv0ϕn(v0, va(n,1), . . . , va(n,mn))

∈Φ.
This is easy to check by induction on ϕ and from it (i) and (ii) of the theorem follow
routinely.
To prove (iii), given f : J ֌ Ië which is order-preserving and given x ∈B, ﬁnd
ﬁrst an increasing sequence x1 <B x2 <B · · · <B xm of members of J and a formula
ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) such that
x = [ìv0ϕ(v0, x1, . . . , xn)]B
and set
f∗(x) = equivalence class of
 f(x1), . . . , f(xn), ìv0ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn)

.
It is easy to check that the deﬁnition of f∗(x) is independent of the choice of
x1, . . . , xn, ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) using the homogeneity of J and the fact that f∗is an
elementary imbedding follows directly from the lemma. Also (iv) follows immedi-
ately, because if f is onto Ië, then f∗is clearly onto Aë.
Finally, to prove (v), suppose ﬁrst that κ is uncountable and Aκ is wellfounded and
let ë be any countable ordinal, let J ⊆Iκ be any subset of Iκ of order type ë and

8H.3]
8H. On the theory of indiscernibles
453
consider the structure B = (J ∗, -) which is an elementary substructure of Aκ by 8H.1.
Now J is homogeneous in B and generates B, and
Char(B, J) = Char(Aκ, Iκ) = Φ;
thus if we let f : J ֌
→Ië be the unique order-preserving bijection of J with Ië, the
extended map f∗: J ∗֌
→Aë is an isomorphism, in particular it takes the ordering
≤B in an order-preserving way onto ≤Aë. But ≤B is a wellordering since it is the
restriction of ≤κ to J ∗, and so ≤Aî is also a wellordering.
This shows that in (v), (c)=⇒(b). To show that (b)=⇒(a) and complete the proof,
suppose that for some κ, Aκ is not wellfounded and let
x1 >Aκ x2 >Aκ · · ·
be an inﬁnite descending chain—we can ﬁnd one even without appealing to the Axiom
of Choice, because the domain Aκ is obviously a wellorderable set. Now each xi =
[ìv0ϕi(v0, yi
1, . . . , yi
ni)]A
κ for a suitable ϕi(v0, v1, . . . , vni) and members yi
1, . . . , yi
ni of Iκ,
so there is a countable subset J ⊆Iκ such that for each i, xi ∈J ∗; this simply means
that the elementary substructure B = (J ∗, -) is not wellfounded. Finally, if ë is the
countable order-type of the set J, then as above B is isomorphic with Aë and Aë is
not wellfounded.
⊣
It is very important in this model-theoretic construction that the pairs (Aë, Ië) were
constructed directly from the set of formulas Φ, assuming only that Φ = Char(A, I )
for some pair (A, I ), but not using any particular A, I in the construction. Thus we
have an operation
Γ(ë, Φ) = (Aë, Ië)
which assigns to each ordinal ë and each character Φ a pair (Aë, Ië) with the appro-
priate properties.
We now turn to apply this basic result from model theory to ZFL and ZFL[ ˙α]
following Silver [1971].
It will be convenient to abuse notation slightly by using the symbol “Lκ[α]” to refer
both to the set Lκ[α] and to the structure (Lκ[α], ∈, α), for any given α ∈N. One
should keep in mind that in the language of these structures we have a relation symbol
which deﬁnes α, although this will be suppressed in our notation.
We should also point out that in any model of ZFL[ ˙α] the ordinals are coﬁnal in the
canonical ordering. This is because by (the relativized version of) 8F.1 and 8D.10
y ∈Lî[α] & x ≤y =⇒x ∈Lî[α],
î /∈Lî[α],
so that
y ∈Lî[α] =⇒y < î;
now this is a theorem of ZF, so its formal version holds in every model of ZFL[ ˙α] which
also satisﬁes “(∀y)(∃î)

y ∈Lî[α]

” and which hence also satisﬁes “(∀y)(∃î)[y < î]”.
8H.3. Theorem (Silver [1971]). Suppose α ∈N, κ is a measurable cardinal and U
is a normal ultraﬁlter on κ.
(i) Lκ[α] |= ZFL[ ˙α].
(ii) There exists some set I ⊆κ such that I ∈U and I is homogeneous in Lκ[α].
(iii) If I ⊆κ, I ∈U and I is homogeneous in Lκ[α], then the following hold:

(a) For each formula ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) and for each increasing sequence of ordinals

Proof. To check (i), go back to the proof of 6G.9 and check that the following was
actually shown, without appeal to the Axiom of Choice: if κ is measurable, ë < κ and
{Xî}î<ì is a wellordered sequence of distinct subsets of ë, then ì < κ. This implies
easily that
L[α] |= “κ is a strongly inaccessible cardinal”
and hence by 8C.11, since Lκ[α] satisﬁes the Axiom of Choice,
L[α] |= “Lκ[α] is a model of ZFC”.
Now simple absoluteness consideration imply that in fact
Lκ[α] |= ZFC
and again, easily, using 8F.1, Lκ[α] |= “V = L(α)”, so that Lκ[α] |= ZFL[ ˙α].
(ii) For each formula ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) with n free variables deﬁne
Fϕ : κ[n] →{0, 1}
by setting ﬁrst
F1(î1, . . . , în) =
(
1
if Lκ[α] |= ϕ(î1, . . . , în)
0
if Lκ[α] |= ¬ϕ(î1, . . . , în)
and for each n-element subset X of κ, putting
Fϕ(X) = F1(î1, . . . , în)
where î1 < î2 < · · · < în is an increasing enumeration of X. Since there are only
countably many formulas, we can use 6G.4 to get a set I ∈U which is homogeneous
for each partition Fϕ and hence homogeneous for Lκ[α].
(iii) (a) If Lκ[α] |= (∃v0)ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în) with î1, . . . , în in I , then for some x we
have Lκ[α] |= ϕ(x, î1, . . . , în) and since I is coﬁnal in κ and hence in the canonical
ordering of Lκ[α], we have some ì ∈I , î1 < · · · < în < ì and x < ì. Thus
Lκ[α] |= ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în) < ì
and by homogeneity, for any ë < în, ë ∈I ,
Lκ[α] |= ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în) < ë.
(iii) (b) Assume
Lκ[α] |= ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în, ç1, . . . , çm) < ç1
and let
x = [ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , înç1, . . . , çm)]Lκ[α].

Since x < ç1, we have x ∈Lç1[α] by the basic properties of the canonical wellordering
on Lκ[α] and hence x ∈Lî[α] for some î < ç1. (The set of limit ordinals below κ is
easily of normal measure 1, so that ç1 is limit.) Thus
Lκ[α] |= “(∃î)

ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în, ç1, . . . , çm) ∈Lî[α] & î < ç1

”
(∗)
and hence the same formula must be satisﬁed by Lκ[α] if we replace ç1, . . . , çm by any
other increasing tuple æ1, . . . , æm from I with în < æ1.
We now deﬁne F (æ) for æ ∈I , æ > în as follows: let æ1 = æ, let æ2, . . . , æm be the
ﬁrst m −1 members of I above æ and put
F (æ) = least î such that Lκ[α] |= “ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în, æ1, . . . , æm) ∈Lî[α]”.
We have F (æ) < æ for all æ ∈I , æ > în, so by normality there is a ﬁxed æ∗such that
F (æ) = æ∗for all æ is some set J ∈U.
Again deﬁne G(æ) for æ ∈J, æ > în by choosing æ1, . . . , æm as above and putting
G(æ) = [ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în, æ1, . . . , æm)]Lκ[α].
Now G(æ) ∈Læ∗[α] for all æ ∈J, æ > în and card(Læ∗[α]) = card(æ∗) < κ, so we
have a ﬁxed element x∗∈Læ∗[α] such that for all æ is some H ∈U, G(æ) = x∗.
If æ and æ′′ are far apart in H so that
æ1 < æ2 < · · · < æm < æ′′
1 < æ′′
2 < · · · < æ′′
m,
then the equation G(æ) = G(æ′′) simply means that
Lκ[α] |= ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în, æ1, . . . , æm) = ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în, æ′′
1 , . . . , æ′′
m)
(∗∗)
so by homogeneity, (∗∗) actually holds for all
î1 < · · · < în < æ1 < · · · < æm < æ′′
1 < · · · < æ′′
m
in I . Finally given î1 < · · · < în < ç1 < · · · < çm and î1 < · · · < în < ç′
1 < · · · < ç′
m
in I , choose ordinals æ′′
1 < · · · < æ′′
m in I above çm and ç′
m and apply (∗∗) with
æ′′
1 , . . . , æ′′
m and taking æi = çi ﬁrst and æi = ç′
i afterwards to obtain the desired result
Lκ[α] |= ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în, ç1, . . . , çm) = ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în, ç′
1, . . . , ç′
m).
⊣
Fix now a measurable cardinal κ, an irrational α and a set I ⊆U of normal
measure 1 which is homogeneous in Lκ[α] and let
Φ = Char(Lκ[α], I )
= {ϕ(v1, . . . , vn) : ϕ(v1, . . . , vn) is in the language of ZFL[ ˙α]
and for î1 < · · · < în in I , Lκ[α] |= ϕ(î1, . . . , în)}.
It is clear from the last two theorems that Φ satisﬁes the following conditions, where
for each n, m, ϕn,m is the sentence of ZFL[ ˙α] which expresses formally the assertion
⟨⟨n, m⟩⟩∈˙α.
(R1) there exists a pair (A, I ), where A |= ZFL[ ˙α], I is an inﬁnite homogeneous set
in A and
Φ = Char(A, I ).
(R2) The formula Ordinal(v1) is in Φ, and for each n, m,
α(n) = m ⇐⇒ϕn,m ∈Φ.
(R3) For each formula ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) in the language of ZFL[ ˙α], the formula
(∃v0)ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) →ìv0ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) < vn+1

[8H.4
is in Φ.
(R4) For each formula ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn, vn+1, . . . , vn+m), the formula
ìv0ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn, vn+1, . . . , vn+m) < vn+1
→ìv0ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn, vn+1, . . . , vn+m)
= ìv0ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn, vn+m+1, . . . , vn+m+m)
is in Φ.
(R5) For each countable limit ordinal ë, if Γ(ë, Φ) = (Aë, Ië) is the canonical pair
associated with Φ by 8H.2, then Aë is wellfounded.
The remarkable thing about these conditions is that they do not refer at all to κ or I —
whether they hold or not depends only on the set of formulas Φ and the irrational α—
and yet as we will see in the next theorem they determine Char(Lκ[α], I ) completely,
no matter which measurable cardinal κ and which set I of normal measure 1 in κ we
choose.
If Φ is any collection of formulas satisfying (1)–(5), we will call it a remarkable
character for α. For the record:
8H.4. Corollary (Silver [1971]). If there exists a measurable cardinal, then for each
α ∈N there exists a remarkable character for α.
⊣
We next come to the main theorem in the theory of indiscernibles for L and L[α].
8H.5. Theorem (Silver [1971]). If α ∈N and Φ is a remarkable character for α,
then there exists exactly one class of ordinals I with the following two properties.
(i) I is closed and unbounded.
(ii) For each uncountable ordinal ë, I ∩ë is a homogeneous set in Lë[α] which generates
Lë[α] and satisﬁes
Φ = Char(Lë[α], I ∩ë).
Moreover, I contains all uncountable cardinals and for any cardinal κ ≥ℵù,
Φ = {ϕ(v1, . . . , vn) : Lκ[α] |= ϕ(ℵ1, . . . , ℵn)}.
In particular, there is at most one remarkable character for α.
Proof. Fix Φ and let
Γ(ë, Φ) = (Aë, I ′
ë)
be the canonical pair associated with Φ and each ordinal ë by 8H.2. By (R5) and 8H.2
each Aë is isomorphic with some Lë∗[α′] and we must have α′ = α because of (R2).
Also, if Ië is the image of the homogeneous set I ′
ë under the isomorphism of Aë with
Lë∗[α], then Ië is homogeneous in Lë∗[α], it generates Lë∗[α] and by (R2) again, it is
the set of ordinals of order-type ë, so in particular ë ≤ë∗.
We will eventually set
I = S
ë Ië
after some lemmas. To simplify notation, let us put
ôë
ϕ(î1, . . . , în) = [ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în)]Lë∗[α],
for each formula ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) such that (∃v0)ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) ∈Φ and for each
î1 < · · · < în in Ië.
Lemma 1. Ië is coﬁnal and closed in Lë∗[α].

Proof. Each x ∈Lë∗[α] is ôë
ϕ(î1, . . . , în) for some î1 < · · · < în in Ië, and by (R3),
if în < ç and ç ∈Ië, we have ôë
ϕ(î1, . . . , în) < ç; thus Ië is coﬁnal in Lë∗[α].
To prove that Ië is closed, suppose towards a contradiction that ì < ë∗, Ië ∩ì is
coﬁnal in ì but ì /∈Ië, so that
ì = ôë
ϕ(î1, . . . , în, ç1, . . . , çm)
for some ôë
ϕ and ordinals in Ië with
î1 < · · · < în < ì < ç1 < · · · < çm.
By (R4) then, taking ç′
1 < · · · < ç′
m < ì in Ië with în < ç′
1, we have
ì = ôë
ϕ(î1, . . . , în, ç1, . . . , çm) = ôë
ϕ(î1, . . . , în, ç′

and hence by (R3)
ì = ôë
ϕ(î1, . . . , în, ç′
1, . . . , ç′
m) < ì
which is absurd.
⊣(Lemma 1)
Lemma 2. If ë < κ are limit ordinals, then ë∗∈Iκ,
Ië = Iκ ∩ë∗
and Lë∗[α] is an elementary submodel of Lκ∗[α].
Proof. Let
f : Ië ֌ Iκ
be the unique order-preserving map of Ië onto an initial segment J of Iκ, say
J = Iκ ∩ì
where ì ∈Iκ since Iκ is closed. Let J ∗be the elementary substructure of Lκ∗[α]
generated by J, so that J is homogeneous in J ∗and Char(J ∗, J) = Φ.
Finally
by 8H.2, let
f∗: Lë∗[α] ֌
→J ∗
be the canonical isomorphism induced by f. We will prove that
J ∗= Lì[α];
(∗)
from this it follows immediately that f∗takes the ordinals below ë∗in an order-
preserving fashion onto the ordinals below ì, so that f∗is the identity map on ë∗,
ì = ë∗and
Ië = J = Iκ ∩ì = Iκ ∩ë∗.
Moreover, since the identity
f∗: Lë∗[α] ֌ Lë∗[α]
is an elementary embedding by 8H.2, it follows that Lë∗[α] is an elementary submodel
of Lκ∗[α].
To prove (∗) choose a formula ø(x, î) in the language of ZFL[ ˙α] so that for each
Læ[α] |= ZFL[ ˙α] and x, î ∈Læ[α]
x ∈Læ[α] ⇐⇒Læ[α] |= ø(x, î),
and if x ∈J ∗, choose î1 < · · · < în ∈J and ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) so that
x = ôκ
ϕ(î1, . . . , în).
Now for some ç ∈Iκ,
Lκ∗[α] |= ø

and hence by homogeneity and the fact that în < ì ∈Iκ,
Lκ∗[α] |= ø

and x ∈Lì[α].
On the other hand if x ∈Lì[α] and
x = ôκ
ϕ(î1, . . . , în, ç1, . . . , çm)
with î1 < · · · < în in J and ç1 < · · · < çm in Iκ above J, then
Lκ∗[α] |= ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în, ç1, . . . , çm) < ì < ç1
so that by (R4), if ç′
1 < · · · < ç′
m ∈J with în < ç′
1 we have
Lκ∗[α] |= ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în, ç1, . . . , çm) = ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în, ç′

i.e.,
x = ôκ
ϕ(î1, . . . , în, ç′
1, . . . , ç′
m) ∈J ∗.
⊣(Lemma 2)
Lemma 3. If ë is an uncountable cardinal, then
ë∗= ë.
Proof. Let κ be any limit ordinal above ë and assume towards a contradiction that
card(Iκ ∩ë) ≤æ < ë
with æ inﬁnite. Now every ordinal î < ë is of the form
î = ôκ
ϕ(î1, . . . , în, ç1, . . . , çm)
with some ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn, vn+1, . . . , vm+1) and with î1 < · · · < în in Iκ ∩ë and
ç1 < · · · < çm in Iκ above ë, and by (R4), the value of ôκ
ϕ(î1, . . . , în, ç1, . . . , çm)
depends only on the tuple
⟨⟨ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn, vn+m), î1, . . . , în⟩⟩,
since î < ç1. But there are only ℵ0 · æn = æ such tuples for each n and hence only æ
such tuples altogether, which is absurd, since there are ë > æ ordinals below ë.
We now have card(Iκ ∩ë) = ë and hence the order type of Iκ ∩ë is exactly ë.
Since Iκ ∩ë is an initial segment of Iκ ∩ë∗which also has order-type ë, we must have
Iκ ∩ë = Iκ ∩ë∗= Ië and since Ië is coﬁnal in ë∗, we have ë = ë∗.
⊣(Lemma 3)
Now (i) and (ii) follow immediately with
I = S
ë Ië.
If J is another class of ordinals which also satisﬁes (i) and (ii), then for each
uncountable ë let
f : J ∩ë ֌
→I ∩ë
be the unique order-preserving bijection and let
f∗: Lë[α] ֌
→Lë[α]
be the canonical extension of f to an isomorphism. Clearly f∗is the identity on ë
and hence f is the identity and
J ∩ë = I ∩ë.
Since ë was arbitrary countable, J = I . Finally, if ë is an uncountable cardinal, then
ë = ë∗∈I

If Φ is the unique remarkable character for α ( assuming it exists), put

if n is the code of some formula ϕ(v1, . . . , vkn) ∈Φ,

otherwise,
where of course, we are using the recursive coding of formulas of Section 8A. It is
convenient (and traditional) to treat the unrelativized case of L as a special case of
this, noticing that
L = L[t 7→0]
and putting
0# = (t 7→0)#,
assuming of course that there exists a remarkable character for the constant function
t 7→0. It is also traditional to abbreviate the ponderous-sounding hypothesis
“there exists a remarkable character for α”
by the simpler if somewhat sloppier
“α# exists”.
By 8H.4 then, if there exists a measurable cardinal, then (∀α)[α# exists].
8H.6. Theorem (Solovay [1967]). The relation
P(α, â) ⇐⇒α# exists and â = α#
is Π1
2. Thus, if α# exists, then
ã ∈L[α] =⇒ã is recursive in α# =⇒ã ∈∆1
3(α)
and α# is an irrational in ∆1
3(α) which is not in L[α].
Proof. Compute,
P(α, â) ⇐⇒(∀n)
h
â(n) ≤1 &

â(n) = 1 =⇒
 n is the code of some
formula ϕ(v1, . . . , vkn) in the language of ZFL[ ˙α]

& if Φâ = {ϕ(v1, . . . , vk) : if n is the code of
ϕ(v1, . . . , vk), then â(n) = 1}, then Φâ
satisﬁes (R1)–(R5) in the deﬁnition of
“remarkable character”.
It is now obvious that
P1(α, â) ⇐⇒Φâ satisﬁes (R1)
is Σ1
1. (Actually, P1 is arithmetical, but the proof of this requires G¨odel’s Completeness
Theorem from logic which we have not proved.)
Similarly,
P2(α, â) ⇐⇒Φâ satisﬁes (R2), (R3) and (R4)
is obviously arithmetical. Thus to complete the proof, it will be enough to ﬁnd a Π1
2
relation P3(α, â) such that
P1(α, â) & P2(α, â) =⇒[P3(α, â) ⇐⇒Φâ satisﬁes (R5)]
and for this we use Theorem 8H.2.

460
8. Metamathematics
[8H.7
From that result we know that if P1(α, â) hold, then for each countable ordinal
ë there exists a pair (Aë, Ië) with certain properties, that any two such pairs are
isomorphic and that (R5) holds exactly when in every such pair, Aë is a wellfounded
model. Using the irrational codes for structures with domain in ù that we introduced
in the Exercises of 8A, put
P4(α, â, ã, ä) ⇐⇒P1(α, â) & P2(α, â) & Str(⟨2, 2⟩, ã)
& [ the set Iä = {n : ä(n) = 1} is homogeneous in A(⟨2, 2⟩, ã)
and generates A(⟨2, 2⟩, ã)] & Char
 A(⟨2, 2⟩, ã), Iä

= Φâ
and compute easily that P4 is Σ1
1, using the fact that the satisfaction relation is ∆1
1, 8A.6.
But then the relation
P5(α, â, ã, ä, ε) ⇐⇒P4(α, â, ã, ä) & ε ∈WO
& [the order-type of Iä under the canonical ordering of A(⟨2, 2⟩, ã) is |ε|]
is easily ∆1
2 and hence
P3(α, â) ⇐⇒P1(α, â) & P2(α, â) & (∀ε)(∀ã)(∀ä)

P5(α, â, ã, ä, ε)
=⇒the canonical ordering of A(⟨2, 2⟩, ã) is a wellordering

is in Π1
2 and the proof is complete.
If α# exists, then obviously
α#(n) = i ⇐⇒(∃â)[P(α, â) & â(n) = i]
⇐⇒(∀â)[P(α, â) =⇒â(n) = i]
so that α# ∈∆1
3(α).
Also, if ã ∈L[α], then
ã = [ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în)]Lκ[α]
with any κ ≥ℵ1, κ a cardinal and î1 < · · · < în in the canonical homogeneous set
I ∩κ, so that if Φ is the remarkable character for α,
ã(s) = t ⇐⇒the sentence
(∃v0)[ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) & (∀x < v0)¬ϕ(x, v1, . . . , vn) & “⟨⟨s, t⟩⟩∈v0”] is in Φ
where of course,
“⟨⟨s, t⟩⟩∈v0”
is some formula with code recursively obtained from s, t and which expresses that
⟨⟨s, t⟩⟩∈v0. Thus ã is clearly recursive in α#.

8H.7. Corollary. If α# exists (and, in particular, if there exists a measurable cardi-
nal), then card(N ∩L[α]) = ℵ0. (Silver [1971]; Rowbottom [1971] for the inference
from the existence of a measurable cardinal.)

Assuming that (∀α)[α# exists], let Iα be the canonical, closed and unbounded class
of Silver indiscernibles for L[α] supplied by 8H.5 and let
I ∗= T{Iα : α ∈N}
be the class of uniform indiscernibles.

8H.8. Lemma. Assume (∀α)[α# exists].
(i) There is a ﬁxed formula ϕ(α, î) of L∈such that for every inner model M of ZF
such that α# ∈M,
î ∈Iα ⇐⇒M |= ϕ(α, î).
(ii) If α ∈L[â], then Iâ ⊆Iα.
(iii) The class I ∗of uniform indiscernibles is closed and unbounded, it contains all
uncountable cardinals, and for any α ∈N and any u ∈I ∗, the order-type of Iα ∩u is u.
Proof. (i) Using 8H.6, we easily get a deﬁnition of α# in terms of α which is
absolute for all inner models of ZF which contain α#; again, using the construction
in 8H.5 we can get the deﬁnition of Iα from α# which is absolute for all inner models
of ZF.
(ii) If α ∈L[â], then α = [ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în)]L[â] for some ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) and
some î1 < · · · < în in Iâ and then using (R4), easily,
α = [ìv0ϕ(v0, î1, . . . , în)]L[â]
for some ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) and any increasing sequence î1 < · · · < în in Iâ. Using this
and a recursion on formulas, we easily assign to each ø(x1, . . . , xk) in the language of
ZFL[ ˙α] another formula ø∗(x1, . . . , xk, y1, . . . , yn) so that for x1, . . . , xk ∈L[α] and
any î1 < · · · < în in Iâ,
L[α] |= ø(x1, . . . , xk) ⇐⇒L[â] |= ø∗(x1, . . . , xk, î1, . . . , în).
Thus for any ordinals ç1 < · · · < çk,
[ìv0ø(v0, ç1, . . . , çk)]L[α] = [ìv0ø∗(v0, ç1, . . . , çk, î1, . . . , în)]L[α],
(∗)
where î1 < · · · < în are any cardinals above çk.
Suppose now towards a contradiction that ë is the least ordinal in Iâ \ Iα so that
ë = [ìv0÷(v0, ç1, . . . , çl, ç′
1, . . . , ç′
m)]L[α]
with ç1 < · · · < çl < ë in Iα (and hence in Iâ) and ç′
1 < · · · < ç′
m in Iα above ë.
Using (R4) we may replace the ç′
i by cardinals above ë, so they too are in Iâ and then
using (∗) with cardinals î1 < · · · < în above ç′
m we have
ë = [ìv0÷∗(v0, ç1, . . . , çl, ç′
1, . . . , ç′
m, î1, . . . , în)]L[â] < ç′
1.
(∗∗)
Since ë ∈Iâ, by (R4) we then have
ë = [ìv0÷∗(v0, ç1, . . . , çl, ç′
1, . . . , ç′
m, î1, . . . , în)]L[â] < ë
which is absurd.
(iii) Let {cα
î }î∈ON be an increasing enumeration of Iα and let ë < u ∈I ∗. By (i),
the operation
î 7→cα
î
is deﬁnable from α in L[α#], so that there is some formula ø(v0, α, v1) and
cë = [ìv0ø(v0, α, ë)]L[α#] = supremum{cα
î : î < ë}
and then, since u ∈Iα#, easily aë < u. Thus there are ë distinct members of Iα below
u for each ë < u and hence the order-type of Iα ∩u is u.
The other parts of (iii) are trivial.

Let ϕ0(v0, v1, . . . , vk(0)), ϕ1(v0, v1, . . . , vk(1)), . . . be an enumeration of all formulas
in the language of set theory such that
L |= “ìv0ϕn(v0, ℵ1, . . . , ℵk(n)) is a sequence of ordinals”.
It is clear that we can enumerate these formulas recursively in 0# and that if I0 is the
class of Silver indiscernibles for t 7→0 and ë is any limit point of I0 then the following
two things hold.
(1) If î1 < · · · < îk(n) < ë are all in I0, then
ôL
n (î1, . . . , îk(n)) = [ìv0ϕn(v0, î1, . . . , îk(n))]L
is a ﬁnite sequence of ordinals below ë.
(2) If (ç0, . . . , çm−1) is any sequence of ordinals below ë, then
(ç0, . . . , çm−1) = ôL
n (î1, . . . , îk(n))
for some n and some î1 < · · · < îk(n) below ë in I0.

We now deﬁne a sequence of norms on P by
øn(α) = ñ
 T(uk(n)+1, α), ôL
n (u1, . . . , uk(n))

and we claim that ø = {øn} is the required ∆1
3-scale on P. The motivation for this
deﬁnition will become clear from the argument to follow.
To check ﬁrst that ø is a scale on P, suppose α0, α1, . . . are all in P, limi→∞αi = α
and for each n and all large enough i,
øn(αi) = ën;
we must show that α ∈P and for each n, øn(α) ≤ën.
Let â be any irrational such that each αi is recursive in â and by the lemma
Iâ ⊆Iαi
and ﬁx an increasing enumeration {c(î) : î ∈ON} of Iâ. By the lemma,
î < uù =⇒c(î) < uù.
Since the relation

n (x1, . . . , xk(n))

= ñ
 T(ë, αj), ôL
n (x1, . . . , xk(n))

is easily deﬁnable in L[â] and since it is true for all large enough i and j when
x1 = u1, . . . , xk(n) = uk(n),
ë = uk(n)+1,
it is also true for all large enough i and j when
x1 = c(î1), . . . , xk(n) = c(în),
î = uù
for any increasing sequence î1 < · · · < îk(n) of ordinals below uù.
For each sequence v = (ç0, . . . , çm−1) in T(uù, α), choose n and an n-tuple of
ordinals î1 < · · · < îk(n) in I0 such that
v = ôL
n (î1, . . . , în)
and let
f(v) = limi→∞ñ

The deﬁnition of f(v) is independent of the choice of n and î1 < · · · < îk(n) in I0,
since
ôL
n (î1, . . . , îk(n)) = ôL
m(æ1, . . . , æk(m))
(∗)
is a formal assertion in L about the indiscernibles î1, . . . , îk(n), æ1, . . . , æk(m) and the
ordinals c(î1), . . . , c(îk(n)), c(æ1), . . . , c(æk(m)) are also indiscernibles and with the

Solovay and Kunen have shown that actually
un = ℵn
n = 1, 2, 3, . . .
granting AD, but we will not prove this here; see Kechris [1978a] or Kleinberg [1977].
We need another of Solovay’s lemmas however, to derive the corollaries of 8H.9 which
depend on the Axiom of Choice.
8H.12. Lemma (Solovay). If (∀α)[α# exists], then for each n ≥1,
coﬁnality(un+1) = coﬁnality(u2) ≤ℵ2.
In particular, if the Axiom of Choice holds, then u3, u4, . . . are all singular and uù < ℵ3.
Proof. It is easy to show by induction on î, that for each î < uù there is some
α and some ϕ(v0, v1, . . . , vn) in the language of ZFL[ ˙α] such that for any cardinal
κ ≥uù,
î = [ìv0ϕ(v0, u1, . . . , un)]Lκ[α];
assuming the result for all î′ < î and assuming î ̸= un, then
î = [ìv0ø(v0, î1, . . . , în, ç1, . . . , çm)]Lκ[α];
with î1 < · · · < în < î < ç1 < · · · < çm and the îi, çj in Iα, each îi is deﬁnable in
some Lκ[αi] in terms of the uniform indiscernibles, we can substitute larger uniform
indiscernibles for the çj and î is easily deﬁnable from uniform indiscernibles in any
Lκ[â] where α, α1, . . . , αn are all recursive in â.
Now put for each ordinal ë
next(ë, α) = the least member of Iα greater than ë
and notice that for each n, α by (iii) or 8H.8
un < next(un, α) < un+1.
Claim:
un+1 = supremum{next(un, α) : α ∈N}.
To prove this suppose
ë = supremum{next(un, α) : α ∈N} < un+1
so that ë is not a uniform indiscernible and for some α,
ë = [ìv0ϕ(v0, u1, . . . , un, un+1, . . . , uk)]L[α] < un+1

466
8. Metamathematics
[8H.13
by what we proved above. But we can then substitute next(un, α) for un+1 in this
formula and we get ë < next(un, α) which is absurd.
Finally, notice that
next(u1, α) = next(u1, â) =⇒next(un, α) = next(un, â)
since the assertion on the left can be expressed formally as
L[⟨α, â⟩#] |= ϕ(u1)
with a formula ϕ(v1) in the language of ZFL[ ˙α] and so we should also have
L[⟨α, â⟩#] |= ϕ(un).
Thus the set of ordinals
A = {î < u2 : for some α, î = next(u1, α)}
is coﬁnal in u2 and the map that sends
î = next(u1, α) to f(î) = next(un, α)
is well-deﬁned and establishes that coﬁnality(un+1) = coﬁnality(u2).
If the Axiom of Choice holds, then ℵ3 is a regular cardinal so we must have un < ℵ3
for each n and ﬁnally uù < ℵ3, since uù has coﬁnality ù.

8I. Some remarks about strong hypotheses
The need to consider strong theoretic hypotheses has been explained in the introduc-
tion to this monograph and again in Chapter 5 and in the introduction to Chapter 6:
simply put, ZFC is just not strong enough to decide the most natural and basic ques-
tions about deﬁnable sets of real numbers. Here we will discuss very brieﬂy some of
the serious foundational questions which arise in the study of strong hypotheses.
There are essentially three propositions whose consequences we have considered
in some detail, G¨odel’s Axiom of Constructibility (V = L), the assumption that
measurable cardinals exist (MC) and various determinacy hypotheses among which
the strongest (and most natural) is
Det(L(R)) ⇐⇒every game in L(R) is determined
⇐⇒L(R) |= AD.
We take it for granted that neither V = L nor Det(L(R)) are “obviously true” on
the basis of our current understanding of the notion of set.
MC is in a diﬀerent category as it follows from strong “large cardinal axioms”
whose truth can be supported by some a priori arguments, see Solovay, Reinhardt, and
Kanamori [1978]. If we accept these large cardinal axioms as (at least) highly plausible
on the basis of their meaning, then the chief foundational problem of descriptive set
theory becomes simply to prove the fruitful hypothesis Det(L(R)).
Martin [1980]
broke new ground in this important program by showing that Det(Σ
e
1
2) follows from
“the existence of a non-trivial, iterable elementary imbedding of some Vκ into itself”,
and the fundamental Martin-Steel-Woodin Theorem (proved after the ﬁrst edition
of this book) solved this problem by deriving Det(L(R)) from axioms substantially
weaker than expected; see the historical reference (4) in Chapter 6.
We cannot do justice here to this foundational position that takes (some) large
cardinal axioms as evident without going into the technical results of that part of set
theory, so we will defer to the forthcoming Martin [20??]. Suﬃce it to say that the

8I. Some remarks about strong hypotheses
469
surprising connection between large cardinals and determinacy hypotheses is quite
fascinating independently of any philosophical considerations.
It is also fair to remark that not all set theorists accept the intrinsic plausibility of
large cardinal axioms.
Going one step further, many set theorists do not adhere to the realistic approach
towards mathematics which we have adopted throughout this book and are uncomfort-
able with references to the “truth” or “falsity” of complicated set theoretic propositions
like V = L, MC and Det(L(R)). Without embarking in one of those shallow and
fruitless discussions of “formalism” versus “realism,” we will make just a few remarks
to help clarify our position.
The main point in favor of the realistic approach to mathematics is the instinctive
certainty of almost everybody who has ever tried to solve a mathematical problem that
he is thinking about “real objects,” whether they are sets, numbers, or whatever; and
that these objects have intrinsic properties above and beyond the speciﬁc axioms about
them on which he is basing his thinking for the moment. Nevertheless, most attempts
to turn these strong feelings into a coherent foundation for mathematics invariably
lead to vague discussions of “existence of abstract notions” which are quite repugnant
to a mathematician.
Contrast with this the relative ease with which formalism can be explained in a
precise, elegant and self-consistent manner and you will have the main reason why
most mathematicians claim to be formalists (when pressed) while they spend their
working hours behaving as if they were completely unabashed realists.
It is not unreasonable to accept naively that the universe of sets exists (and con-
forms substantially to the description we gave in the introduction to this chapter) and
that we can reason about sets much as physicists reason about elementary particles
or astronomers reason about stars—while conceding immediately that we are in no
position now to make precise (or even talk eloquently about) the kind of “existence”
we have in mind. And it is certainly natural (and useful) for a mathematician to behave
as if the universe of sets existed and conformed to these common-sense ideas about
sets.
One of the main features of this consciously naive realistic approach is that it forces
us to abandon any claims of absolute certainty for our assertions about sets. Instead
of “axioms” (taken as unassailable, by deﬁnition, in the formalist approach), we must
speak of “hypotheses” to be tested against each other and against our basic intuitions
about sets, perhaps to be adopted temporarily and discarded later in the light of
new evidence. To be sure, we have a great deal of conﬁdence in the truth of some
propositions (like the axioms) of ZFC which appear to be evident on the basis of the
(incomplete and vague) description of the universe of sets we gave in the introduction
to this chapter; for others, we must weigh carefully the evidence before we accept them
(tentatively) as true or we reject them.
The most serious foundational problem in this naive realistic approach to set theory
is to determine what kind of evidence we may hope to ﬁnd for favoring a hypothesis
over its negation and how we should weigh such evidence.(6) Before we comment brieﬂy
on this diﬃcult question as it aﬀects the hypotheses we have been studying, we should
discuss the equally important problem of consistency for extensions of ZF.
In 8F.11 we proved the consistency of the theory ZFC+V = L (within our standard
framework of realistic set theory or even constructively from the formal consistency of

470
8. Metamathematics
[8I.1
the weaker theory ZF according to the remarks following 8F.11); can we do the same
for ZFC + MC or ZFC + Det(L(R))?
To formulate this question precisely in a general setting, suppose T is any axiomatic
set theory, i.e., any set of sentences of L∈such that the corresponding set of (number)
codes
T # = {[÷]8 : ÷ ∈T}
(as we deﬁned these in 8A) is recursive. Since T # is a deﬁnable set of numbers, we
can talk about T within the language L∈. The precise deﬁnition of formal proof from
the axioms in T to which we have often alluded is naturally eﬀective, since we should
be able to recognize when a sequence of assertions constitutes a correct proof. Proofs
can be coded by numbers, so that for a given axiomatic set theory T, the relation
ProofT (n, m) ⇐⇒n is the code of some sentence ÷ and m is the code
of a proof of ÷ from the axioms in T
is recursive and hence deﬁnable in L∈, in fact ZF-absolute. Suppose then that ϕT(x, y)
is a formula of L∈such that for all standard models M of some fragment of ZF,
ProofT (n, m) ⇐⇒M |= ϕT(n, m),
let n0 be the code of some self-contradictory assertion (like (∃z)[z ̸= z]) and put
Consis(T) ⇐⇒(∀y)¬ϕT(n0, y);
now this formal sentence Consis(T) clearly expresses within L∈(and ZF-absolutely)
the consistency of the axiomatic theory T.
To simplify notation, put
T ⊢ø ⇐⇒ø is a theorem of T
⇐⇒ø can be proved from the axioms of T.
By the remarks after the proof of 8F.11,
ZF ⊢Consis(ZF) →Consis(ZFC + V = L).
Unfortunately, the corresponding relative consistency assertions for ZFC + MC or
ZFC + Det(L(R)) cannot be proved, because of the following fundamental result of
G¨odel.
8I.1. The Second Incompleteness Theorem of G¨odel. If T is a consistent ax-
iomatic set theory at least as strong as ZF (i.e., ZF ⊆T), then Consis(T) is not a
theorem of T.
This is a very weak version of G¨odel’s celebrated theorem whose natural, general
version does not refer explicitly to set theory—it expresses an inherent weakness of
suﬃciently strong axiomatic systems in any language. For our purposes here, however,
this version is strong enough, in fact the following corollary suﬃces.
8I.2. Corollary. Suppose T is a consistent axiomatic set theory at least as strong
as ZF and such that
T ⊢Consis(ZF);
then the assertion of relative consistency
Consis(ZF) →Consis(T)
is not a theorem of T—a fortiori is is not a theorem of ZF.

8I.3]
8I. Some remarks about strong hypotheses
471
Proof. If both Consis(ZF) →Consis(T) and Consis(ZF) were theorems of T,
so would Consis(T) be a theorem of T, contradicting the Second Incompleteness
Theorem.
⊣
8I.3. Corollary. If ZF + MC is consistent, then the relative consistency assertion
Consis(ZF) →Consis(ZF + MC)
cannot be proved in ZF; similarly, if ZF + Det(L(R)) is consistent, then
Consis(ZF) →Consis
 ZF + Det(L(R))

cannot be proved in ZF.
Outline of Proof. Consider ﬁrst the easier case of the theory ZFC + MC and
recall from 6G.9 that (using choice) every measurable cardinal is strongly inaccessible,
so that in ZFC + MC we can prove the existence of a strongly inaccessible κ; but for
each κ, Vκ is a model of ZF (by 8C.11) and the existence of a model for a theory
implies by elementary means that the theory is consistent, so that
ZFC + MC ⊢Consis(ZF)
and 8I.2 applies.
For the subtler case without choice, recall from 8H.3 that if κ is measurable, then
Lκ is a model of ZF; thus again
ZF + MC ⊢Consis(ZF)
and 8I.2 applies.
Finally, by 7D.18
ZF + AD ⊢MC,
so that
ZF + AD ⊢Consis(ZF)
and
Consis(ZF) →Consis(ZF + AD)
cannot be established in ZF. But
Consis
 ZF + Det(L(R))

→Consis(ZF + AD)
can be established easily in ZF once the notion of proof is made precise—by using the
inner model L(R) just as we use L to show the implication
Consis(ZF) →Consis(ZF + V = L).
⊣
Much stronger results are known in this direction, for example
Consis(ZF) →Consis
 ZF + Det(Σ
e
1
1)

cannot be established in ZFC and
Consis(ZFC + MC) →Consis
 ZF + Det(∆
e
1
2)

cannot be established in ZFC + MC, assuming that the theories involved are in fact
consistent (the second result is due to Solovay).
Thus large cardinal and determinacy hypotheses are quite diﬀerent from V = L in
this respect; if they are consistent, then their consistency (relative to ZF) cannot be
established, unless we are willing to accept methods of proof which go beyond ZFC
and which may be suspect themselves. What are we to make of this?

472
8. Metamathematics
[8I.3
A formalist would conclude that the hypothesis of constructibility V = L is by far
the best way to strengthen ZF, as it is safe (from the point of view of consistency) and
it answers completely (and almost trivially) all the interesting questions of descriptive
set theory.
In the naive, realistic approach, consistency is very weak evidence for truth—after all
the theory ZF + ¬Consis(ZF) is consistent (by the Second Incompleteness Theorem)
and it is obviously false. We must look for criteria other than consistency to evaluate
the plausibility of a new hypothesis.
The key argument against accepting V = L (or even N ⊆L) is that the Axiom
of Constructibility appears to restrict unduly the notion of arbitrary set of integers;
there is no a priori reason why every subset of ù should be deﬁnable from ordinal
parameters, mush less by an elementary deﬁnition over some countable Lî. Some
would go further and claim disbelief that the real line can be deﬁnably wellordered
on any rank—it is quite plausible that the only sets of reals which admit deﬁnable
wellorderings are countable.
We are arguing here that there are some (perhaps weak) direct intuitions which
make V = L look implausible, just as there are some direct intuitions which lend
credibility to large cardinal hypotheses like MC.
No one claims direct intuitions of this type either for or against determinacy
hypothesis—those who have come to favor these hypotheses as plausible, argue from
their consequences as we developed them in the last three chapters. In addition to the
richness and internal harmony of these consequences, two aspects of the theory we
have developed deserve explicit mention.
One is the naturalness of the proofs from determinacy—in each instance where we
prove a property of Π1
3 (say from Det(∆
e
1
2)), the same argument gives a new proof of
the same (known) property for Π1
1, using only the determinacy of clopen sets (which is
a theorem of ZF). Thus the new results appear to be natural generalizations of known
results and their proofs shed new light on classical descriptive set theory. (This is not
the case with the proofs from V = L which all depend on the Σ1
2-good wellordering
of N and shed no light on Π1
1.)
The second point is the surprising connection between determinacy and large cardi-
nal hypotheses on which we have commented many times and which lends credence to
both. To take one example, the fact that Π1
2 sets can be uniformized by Π1
3 sets follows
both from MC and from Det(∆
e
1
2), by proofs which (at least on the surface) are totally
unrelated; one tends to believe the result then and consequently to take both proofs
seriously and to feel a little more sympathetic towards their respective hypotheses.
At the present state of knowledge only few set theorists accept Det(L(R)) as highly
plausible and no one is quite ready to believe it beyond a reasonable doubt; and it
is certainly possible that someone will simply refute Det(L(R)) (or even Det(Σ
e
1
1)) in
ZFC. On the other hand, it is also possible that the web of implications involving
determinacy hypotheses and relating them to large cardinals will grow steadily until it
presents such a natural and compelling picture that more will succumb to its beauty.
We should end by quoting directly a paragraph from G¨odel [1947] which was written
primarily about large cardinals but which is perhaps even more relevant to determinacy
hypotheses.
“There might exist axioms so abundant in their veriﬁable consequences,
shedding so much light upon a whole discipline, and furnishing such pow-
erful methods for solving given problems (and even solving them, as far

8J]
8J. Historical remarks
473
as that is possible, in a constructivistic way) that quite irrespective of their
intrinsic necessity they would have to be assumed at least in the same sense
as any well established physical theory.”
8J. Historical remarks
1The brief introduction to logic in 8A–8C and our development of G¨odel’s theory
of constructibility in 8D–8F follow quite standard lines and we will not attempt to
provide speciﬁc references here.
2The present, general version of the Approximation Theorem 8G.8 is due to
Moschovakis and ﬁrst appeared in Kechris and Moschovakis [1978b], but the re-
sult is implicit in Solovay [1969], [1970]. The original proofs of Solovay used forcing
techniques.
3For references to early work on inner models of set theory which reﬂect some
determinacy, see Becker [1978]. Our development in the exercises of 8G (starting
with 8G.17) is based on Harrington and Kechris [1981].
4Finally, our brief development of the theory of indiscernibles in 8H follows closely
Silver’s fundamental work in his Ph.D. Thesis, Silver [1971]. See also the expository
Silver [1973] which has references to earlier work, particularly Rowbottom [1971],
Gaifman, and Scott [1961] where it was ﬁrst shown that the existence of measurable
cardinals contradicts V = L.
5In a fundamental advance of the theory developed in Section 8G, Becker and
Kechris [1984] showed that for a pointclass Γ which resembles Π1
1,
L[TΓ] = HΓ,
so that in particular (by 8G.22) L[TΓ] does not depend on the speciﬁc scale used to
construct it. Steel’s
HΓ |= GCH
(under suitable large cardinal hypotheses) has not yet been published, but an outline
of the proof for a closely related result is given in Steel [1995]. Most of the deep results
about the inner models introduced in 8G depend on the tight connection between
determinacy hypotheses, large cardinal axioms and inner model theory which began
with Martin and Steel [1988] and Woodin [1988] and has been developed extensively
since then, and we do not have at hand the appropriate deﬁnitions to refer to them
properly here; some of this is done in Steel [2008], the historical article in Kechris,
L¨owe, and Steel [2008].
6For an illuminating discussion of the nature of evidence for hypotheses in mathe-
matics, see Martin [1998].


THE AXIOMATICS OF POINTCLASSES
We collect here for easy reference the most basic, axiomatically formulated properties
of pointclasses.
(1) Γ is a Σ-pointclass (p. 110) if it contains all semirecursive pointsets and is closed
under trivial substitutions, & , ∨, ∃≤, ∀≤and ∃ù.
(2) A pointclass Γ is adequate (p. 119) if it contains all recursive pointsets and is
closed under (total) recursive substitutions, & , ∨, ∃≤and ∀≤.
(3) A partial function f : X ⇀Y is Γ-recursive on D ⊆Domain(f) if some
P ⊆X × ù in Γ computes f on D, i.e.,
x ∈D =⇒(∀s)[f(x) ∈Ns ⇐⇒P(x, s)].
A pointclass Γ has the Substitution Property (p. 131) if for each Q ⊆Y in Γ and for
each partial function f : X ⇀Y which is Γ-recursive on its domain, there is some
Q∗⊆X in Γ such that for all x ∈X,
f(x)↓=⇒[Q∗(x) ⇐⇒Q
 f(x)

].
(4) Γ is a Σ∗-pointclass (p. 293) if it is a Σ-pointclass which is ù-parametrized (pp.
27, 137) and has the Substitution Property.
(5) Γ is a Spector pointclass (p. 158) if it is a Σ∗-pointclass, closed under ∀ù and
normed (p. 153).
(6) Γ resembles Π1
1 (p. 430) if it is a Spector pointclass with the scale property, closed
under ∀N and such that for each α ∈N, if P ⊆X × Y is in ∆(α) and
Q(x) ⇐⇒Px = {y : P(x, y)} is not meager,
then Q is also in ∆(α); 8G.7 gives a simple suﬃcient condition for this.
∆0
1 is adequate but not a Σ-pointclass, because it is not closed under ∃ù, and not
every Σ-pointclass is adequate (Exercise 3G.3, p. 134), but the stronger conditions on
pointclasses line up:

In the main items, Greek letters and mathematical symbols are alphabetized phoneti-

matters) giving priority to lightface rather than boldface: thus Σ1
