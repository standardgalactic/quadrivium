Introduction
S
ince the dawn of time, humans have looked up at the skies and 
wondered what was up there. Amazingly, with all these centuries of 
sky-watching, it’s only been in the last 50 years that humans have actually 
achieved the ability to visit those points of light in the sky. We’ve sent 
robotic spacecraft to take pictures, and we’ve also sent astronauts to 
experience seeing the Earth from the heavens. Humans have walked on the 
Moon, and future plans call for people to return to the Moon and continue 
on to Mars and beyond.
Space exploration is one of humanity’s grandest adventures, filled with 
stories of amazing discoveries and narrow escapes. It’s the result of incre-
dible feats of technological innovation and has laid the groundwork for major 
advances here on Earth.
Perhaps the most-amazing thing about space exploration is that you don’t 
have to be a rocket scientist to understand it! That’s where Space Exploration 
For Dummies comes in handy. This book doesn’t contain dry equations 
or long lists of space missions. Instead, it covers the greatest stories and 
discoveries of space exploration and highlights reasons why it’s okay to 
dream about visiting the stars.
About This Book
Space Exploration For Dummies isn’t a textbook, a historical treatise, or an 
engineering manual. In this book, we take you on a lighthearted yet informa-
tive trip through the cosmos, beginning with humanity’s first steps off this 
planet and continuing to our collective future in space. Along the way, you 
visit the planets of our solar system and see them as you’ve never seen 
them before. Expect to find out about the latest scientific discoveries from 
planetary probes that have traveled the far reaches of the solar system, from 
burning-hot Mercury to ice-cold Pluto. You also observe the latest designs for 
ships that will allow humans to continue their space journeys.
We follow a roughly chronological organization in this book, which means 
you can easily find out about the classic missions that started it all in the 
1950s and 1960s, or you can jump right to the latest and greatest spacecraft. 
Although the main focus of Space Exploration For Dummies is NASA and 

2
Space Exploration For Dummies 
the United States space program, we also include information on the space 
programs of other countries, including the former Soviet Union, China, and 
European nations.
One other note: Although human exploration has certainly been an exciting, 
and crucial, part of space exploration, robotic missions have also played a 
vital role in mankind’s understanding of its place in the solar system. In this 
book, we cover both robotic and human spaceflight, primarily in separate 
chapters. Read just the astronaut parts, or just give in and read the whole 
thing — it’s your choice.
Conventions Used in This Book
Space exploration is a task that has been accomplished by both genders, but 
the phrase “manned spaceflight” is commonly used to differentiate astronaut 
flights from robotic missions. Although we use phrases such as “human 
spaceflight” or “robotic spacecraft” where possible, in some instances the 
term “manned” or “unmanned” is simply more historically appropriate. 
Remember: Both women and men have made important contributions to 
space exploration, so don’t let the phraseology influence your ability to 
digest and enjoy the information presented here.
Following are a few other conventions we use to help you navigate this book:
 
✓ Keywords in bulleted lists appear in bold.
 
✓ Italics highlight new terms, emphasize certain words, and indicate 
when we’re referring to spacecraft (as opposed to missions of the 
same name).
 
✓ Web sites appear in monofont to help them stand out.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break 
across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that we didn’t put in 
any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. If you want to 
visit one of these Web addresses, type in exactly what you see in this book 
(just pretend like the line break isn’t there).
What You’re Not to Read
Granted, we’d love for you to read this book from cover to cover. But we’re 
not above letting you know that some sections are by far more optional 

3
 Introduction
than others. Throughout the text, you’ll see some paragraphs marked 
with a Technical Stuff icon — these are paragraphs that give some of the 
engineering or scientific details of the mission at hand (or just interesting 
asides that certainly won’t harm you if you pass over them). Skip ’em if you 
want, or read them for an in-depth view.
Similarly, you’ll find sidebars set off from the rest of the text in gray-shaded 
boxes. These elements provide some extra background information or other 
asides that we found particularly interesting but not essential to the story of 
space exploration as a whole. In some chapters, you’ll encounter “Fast facts” 
sidebars that give standardized details on particular missions. Like the 
Technical Stuff paragraphs, you can skip these sidebars without missing out 
on any crucial bits of information.
Foolish Assumptions
As we wrote this book, we made a couple assumptions about you, dear 
reader:
 
✓ You’re fascinated with the science of space and want to know what it’s 
like to be an astronaut.
 
✓ You revel in space missions and discoveries, and you look forward to 
hearing about what’s to come in the world of space exploration.
Unlike the qualifications to be a real-live rocket scientist, you don’t need any 
particular background in math, physics, space medicine, or any other field to 
read this book. (Want to brush up on some basic astronomy though? Glance 
over Chapter 2, which takes you on a whirlwind tour through the heavens.) 
All you need to read and enjoy this book is a comfortable chair, a sense of 
wonder, and perhaps a clear view of the sky.
How This Book Is Organized
Space is huge, and there’s lots of, well, space to be covered in a book all 
about space exploration. (We’ll stop that running joke before it gets started.) 
But don’t worry — we’ve arranged this book in loosely chronological order to 
cover why people should explore space, how we can get there, where and 
when humanity has gone into space, who has gone, and where we’re going in 
the future. The following sections cover what you’ll find in each part.

4
Space Exploration For Dummies 
Part I: Space Exploration: 
Where, Who, and How
This part gives you all the basics in one convenient location. Take a tour of 
astronomy or a quick course in rocket science. Check out all the details 
you’ve been waiting for on how to become an astronaut. But don’t forget that 
space travel, although exciting, is also a dangerous pastime. Part I closes 
with a somber look at some of the tragedies and narrow escapes of the last 
50 years of space exploration.
Part II: The Great Space Race
It was the Cold War. Tensions between the United States and the Soviet 
Union had never been higher. Yet this time of great military rivalry spawned 
a technological competition that literally took the world to new heights, as 
you find out in Part II. Following the Soviet Union’s early success with the 
Sputnik 1 satellite, the U.S. played catch-up until its triumphant Apollo Moon 
landings. Robotic exploration also thrived during this golden age of space 
exploration and discovery.
Part III: Second-Generation Missions
The Space Race was all well and good, and it accomplished its goals of put-
ting “boots on the ground” (well, in this case, moon-boots in lunar dust!). 
But taking the tourist’s view and spending a few hours or days on the Moon 
snapping pictures is one thing. Building a mature space program that can 
allow humans to really live and work in space is completely different. As you 
discover in this part, vehicles such as the Space Shuttle and destinations 
such as the Mir space station allowed society to start learning valuable 
lessons about space survival. Additionally, robotic missions grew more 
complicated as they explored both the inner and outer solar system, and 
Mars turned out to be a lot more difficult to explore than previously thought.
Part IV: Current Space Exploration
If you think the history of space exploration is exciting, look at what’s going 
on right now! From giant space telescopes that can view the far reaches 
of the cosmos to amazing discoveries about Earth’s neighbor Mars, space 
exploration has yielded fascinating scientific results, as you find out in 
Part IV. The development of the International Space Station has allowed for 
a continual human presence in orbit for years now. The station itself has 
provided valuable experience in living, working, and doing science in orbit.

 Introduction
Part V: The Future of Space Exploration
In this part, you discover that the future of the space program is optimistic 
given current NASA plans to send astronauts back to the Moon and then on 
to Mars. Upcoming missions include the retirement of the Space Shuttle and 
the production of a new capsulelike spacecraft called Orion that will take 
astronauts to the International Space Station and eventually beyond. Space 
tourism has opened up the skies to those with enough money to buy a seat. 
Space exploration is expensive, but it’s well worth it in the grand scheme of 
things — the very future of humanity may depend on it.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens is a fun feature in all For Dummies books, and it gives you 
a quick way to find out some interesting facts and figures about space explo-
ration. Here you can expect a brief summary of where to look for life beyond 
Earth and then consider ten ways in which space travel (unfortunately!) 
is nothing like your favorite movies or television shows. Finally, if you’re 
still not convinced how cool, relevant, and necessary space exploration is, 
check out the list of ten types of everyday items that owe their very existence 
to NASA.
Icons Used in This Book
Various icons are scattered throughout the text. Here’s a quick rundown of 
what they look like and what they mean.
 
This icon indicates the most-important concepts and discoveries in space 
exploration.
 
The Technical Stuff icon is for concepts that are a tad more detail-oriented. 
Skip ’em if you want, or read on for some extra edification.
 
Whether you want to find out more about a particular nugget of space 
exploration history or keep up with an ongoing mission, keep your eyes 
peeled for this icon, which directs you to useful Web sites.

Space Exploration For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
This book isn’t a novel — you can start at the beginning and read it through 
to the end, or you can jump in right in the middle. Got a favorite planet? Head 
right to the chapter that describes missions to it. Itching to find out more 
about the International Space Station? Flip straight to Chapter 19. You can 
also just thumb through the book looking at all the pretty pictures. After all, 
taking those pictures is arguably half the point of space exploration.
If you’re not sure where to start, or don’t know enough about space explora-
tion to even have a starting point in mind yet, that’s great — that’s exactly 
what this book is for. Just hop right in and get your feet wet. We recommend 
starting off with Chapter 2, though, if your basic astronomy is a bit rusty, or 
with Chapter 4 if you want to be an astronaut when you grow up (hey, we’re 
all young at heart, right?). And make sure not to skip Chapter 25 if you want 
to find out all sorts of neat facts to annoy your friends with the next time 
you’re watching a science fiction movie.

Part I
Space Exploration: 
Where, Who, and How

In this part . . .
P
art I is set up to provide you with an overall view of 
what space exploration is all about. It begins with a 
brief introduction to astronomy, from our solar system to 
the universe as a whole. Exploring such a vast realm requires 
rockets. Lo and behold, we have a chapter on rocket science 
that covers the gamut from ancient fireworks to the giant 
rocket that launched astronauts to the Moon. Speaking of 
astronauts, they’re the ones doing all that space travel, so 
discover what it’s like to be an astronaut in this part! Of 
course, as exciting as space travel is, it can also be quite 
dangerous — that’s why we close with coverage of some of 
the tragedies, and narrow escapes, of human space 
exploration.

n order to fully understand the stories and legends of space exploration, 
it’s helpful to take a few steps back and see the big picture. Why have 
humans (and a few animals) gone into space? How has society’s concept 
of the “frontier” changed over time, and why do we feel the need to keep 
pushing the boundaries of our known world? This chapter is your introduc-
tion to the study of space exploration; it examines what achievements have 
already been made in the field and gives you a few sneak peeks at what may 
be in the works.
A Quick Spin around the Universe
From the time when humans first began making maps, they’ve had an urge to 
map the skies. Ancient Greek and Roman astronomers were among the first 
to formally name the constellations; Arabic, Chinese, and Native American 
cultures also had their own sky maps.
Theories, both religious and scientific, abound as to how the universe was 
formed. Astronomers generally agree, though, that an explosion of magnifi-
cent proportions was the starting point for our universe and that the Sun 
formed from a collapsing cloud of gas and dust. In the ensuing years, gravity 
pulled together the leftover gas, dust, ice, and other particles from the Sun’s 
formation to create the planets in our solar system, which is roughly divided 
into inner (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) and outer (Jupiter, Saturn, 
Uranus, and Neptune) regions. The Sun and planets form one solar system, 
which, along with the many stars in the sky, all belong to the Milky Way 
Galaxy, one of billions of galaxies that comprise the known universe.

10
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
In Chapter 2, we provide information on how early humans viewed the sky 
and describe the solar system in detail; we also fill you in on extrasolar 
planets, stars, and galaxies.
A Crash Course on Rocket Science
Rocket science, more formally known as aerospace engineering or aeronauti-
cal engineering, is the technology that allows spacecraft to make it into 
orbit. A spacecraft launched from Earth must be able to operate both inside 
the Earth’s atmosphere and in the vacuum of space; typically, a launch 
vehicle such as a rocket is used to travel through the atmosphere to reach 
orbit. Unlike traditional airplanes, spacecraft have to deal with extreme 
temperature and pressure; they must not only endure the harshness of outer 
space but also conduct science and support human life out there. That’s 
quite a tall order for technology.
Although ancient Greek and Chinese astronomers experimented with 
rocketry and fireworks, the real beginnings of rocket science can be traced 
to Leonardo da Vinci and his Renaissance-era sketches of flying machines. 
As technology, science, and engineering evolved in the following centuries, 
spaceflight advanced in leaps and bounds, culminating in the launch of 
the Soviet Union’s Sputnik 1 satellite in 1957, followed by the formation 
of the United States’ National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) 
in 1958.
 
All spacecraft are designed by a full team of specialists who are trained in 
different areas. Some engineers focus on propulsion technologies, for 
example, whereas others are experts in materials, ergonomics, aerodynamics, 
or other areas.
Flip to Chapter 3 for a summary of rockets in history, as well as details on 
how rockets lift off and travel in space, different sources of rocket and 
spacecraft power, and communication via radio telescopes.
An Astronaut’s Life and Times
Being an astronaut is no walk in the park. The requirements of the job 
necessitate not only very intensive training and knowledge but also the 
ability to function under living and working conditions that are often literally 
out of this world.

11
 Chapter 1: Space Exploration in a Nutshell
Earning the privilege to become a United States astronaut is a long and diffi-
cult road. Astronauts must possess advanced degrees, often in physics or 
another technical field, and must train constantly to stay in optimal physical 
condition. They endure grueling practice sessions in order to be prepared 
for survival both in space and upon their return to Earth. Astronauts train 
underwater so they can ready their bodies for performing activities in a 
low-gravity environment; they also work on all the different maneuvers that 
will be expected from them over the course of their journey.
When it comes to living in space, the International Space Station (ISS) may 
have the best view in town, but the accommodations and living conditions 
are a tad less than ideal.
 
✓ Accommodations: Until very recently, the ISS was a three-bedroom, one-
bathroom house (and one of those bedrooms doubled as a laboratory). 
New living space and an additional bathroom were brought to the ISS, 
courtesy of Space Shuttle Endeavour, in November 2008.
 
✓ Living conditions: Astronauts aboard the ISS cope day in and day out 
with microgravity, a very low-gravity environment, which calls for some 
pretty specific changes in the way they do basic things. Activities that 
must be modified include eating (wouldn’t want your food to float away 
from you!), sleeping, and using the restroom.
Check out Chapter 4 for the full scoop on the requirements to become an 
astronaut, the various titles of a space mission’s crew, and the basics of 
living and working in space.
Accidents in Space
With success comes the occasional mishap, and space exploration has had 
its fair share of accidents, as you discover in Chapter 5. These faux pas have 
ranged from the relatively minor (like the 1961 sinking of a Mercury capsule) 
to the near-miss-but-largely-salvageable (like the Apollo 13 mission to the 
Moon in 1970, which failed in most aspects but returned the crew back to 
Earth alive). However, they’ve also featured the utterly catastrophic, such as 
the explosion of Space Shuttle Challenger in 1986, which killed all astronauts 
aboard.
 
Space accidents come with a heavy price in terms of human life, tax-funded 
research dollars, and negative publicity for the space program. The saving 
grace of accidents in space though? Researchers learn from them and 
continually improve designs, technology, and safety with an eye toward 
future success.

Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
In the Beginning: The Great Space Race
The Space Race, which began with the launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 
in 1957, was the ultimate intercontinental throw-down. The world’s major 
superpowers at the time, the Soviet Union and the United States, had similar 
goals in the realm of space exploration. Both countries were determined 
to prove their superiority in technology and spaceflight, resulting in fierce 
competition that drove the two nations to break boundaries and achieve 
goals previously thought to be impossible. The following sections highlight 
the major accomplishments of the Space Race.
A duo of firsts: Sputnik 1 
and animals in space
 
The first victory of the Space Race took just 98 minutes to secure. On October 
4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite 
designed to orbit Earth, which returned a beeping signal that could be 
(and was!) tracked worldwide. The significance of this hour-and-a-half voyage 
went far beyond the orbit itself: The U.S. realized it had some immediate 
catch-up work to do and created NASA (the National Aeronautic and Space 
Administration) in order to get that work done.
Sending robotic satellites into space was one thing. Sending living, breathing 
human beings into space was something else entirely, and (despite earlier 
suborbital animal flights) it was a few years after the launch of Sputnik 1 
before Soviet and American engineers were confident enough in their 
designs to start using human test subjects. Consequently, a range of animals 
(including monkeys, dogs, and insects) became the world’s first astronauts. 
Although not all of these animal astronauts survived, scientists were able to 
learn from early tragedies and eventually make human spaceflight possible. 
Flip to Chapter 6 for more information on the adventures of animals in space.
The first people in space
The first people to travel into space all did so as part of two series of mis-
sions: the Vostok program in the Soviet Union and Project Mercury in the 
U.S. The Soviets claimed another early victory with the triumphant orbital 
flight of Yuri Gagarin in 1961; the Americans followed with flights by Alan 
Shepard in 1961 and John Glenn in 1962. Want more details? Be sure to read 
Chapter 7.

 Chapter 1: Space Exploration in a Nutshell
Robots to the Moon
By the mid-1960s, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union were on track to send 
humans to the Moon, and robotic missions were needed to pave the way 
(see Chapter 8 for details).
 
✓ The Soviet Union made headway with its Luna missions in the 1960s 
and early 1970s, culminating with four missions that returned Moon 
soil samples to Earth. Two missions even included a robotic rover that 
drove over the lunar surface!
 
✓ The U.S. developed its own program beginning with the Ranger missions 
in the 1960s; the first few missions were failures, but Rangers 7, 8, and 9 
returned many close-range photos of the Moon. The NASA Lunar Orbiter 
missions in the mid-1960s produced detailed lunar maps from orbit, 
and the Lunar Surveyor program in the late 1960s put the first American 
spacecraft on the Moon. Equipment was tested and techniques were 
refined, both of which led to the reality of human lunar landings.
Human exploration of the Moon
Sending people to the Moon was, in many ways, the ultimate goal of the 
Space Race. Both the Soviets and the Americans desperately wanted to 
be the first to accomplish this Herculean goal — a goal only one nation 
would achieve.
 
Due to perseverance, ingenuity, and a little bit of Soviet bad luck, the 
Americans pulled ahead in the race to the Moon by 1968. In 1969, Americans 
Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin became the first humans to explore 
the surface of the Moon when the Apollo 11 mission touched down on the 
Sea of Tranquility (see Chapter 9). Five other successful Apollo Moon landings 
followed, as we describe in Chapter 10, allowing astronauts to explore 
different parts of the lunar surface and bring back hundreds of pounds of 
precious Moon rocks. After a series of failures with its N1 rocket, the Soviet 
Union abandoned its goal of sending humans to the Moon in the early 1970s 
and refocused its sights on its space station program.
Missions to other parts of the solar system
Exploring the Moon was of paramount importance to the Space Race, but it 
wasn’t the only outlet for space exploration — on either side of the contest. 
Both the American and Soviet space programs sent space probes to Mars and 
Venus in the 1960s and 1970s, with highly variable rates of success. NASA 
also sent several missions to Jupiter and Saturn. Although more than a few of 

14
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
these missions failed, the successful ones sent back imagery that provided 
people worldwide with the first views of these planets and revealed new 
information about the planets’ compositions and origins. Flip to Chapter 11 
for full details on missions to other parts of the solar system.
The end of the Space Race
A joint American-Soviet mission in 1975 marked the end of the Space Race 
(which had been slowly fizzling out since the success of Apollo 11, despite 
continued Cold War tensions throughout the 1970s). As you discover in 
Chapter 12, a series of Soviet Salyut space stations, and the NASA Skylab 
station, led to this joint mission that involved the docking of a Soyuz space-
craft and an Apollo capsule in orbit. This joint mission featured a handshake 
that symbolically ended the Space Race. Thus, although it began with a bang, 
the Space Race ended quietly and without fanfare as both countries took 
their space programs in new directions with the realization that continued 
success in space would require future collaboration.
The Second Generation of Missions
American success with placing humans on the Moon in no way signaled the 
end of the space program. On the contrary: Now that the world knew what 
was possible, expectations began to rise for what other brave, new worlds 
could be explored. Several major series of second-generation missions, made 
possible by the successes of the Space Shuttle and Soyuz spacecraft, allowed 
astronauts to construct the world’s first large-scale space habitations. New 
views of Mars flooded the news thanks to two spunky little rovers, and the 
mysteries of the inner and outer solar system began to unravel.
The Space Shuttle and Mir
During the prime Space Race years, significant collaboration between the 
U.S. and Soviet space programs was impossible with these two superpowers 
competing directly against one another. After the Space Race concluded, 
though, pathways opened for such collaboration to take place.
 
Enter the Space Shuttle-Mir program, a joint venture whereby Russian cosmo-
nauts traveled to the Russian space station Mir aboard an American Space 
Shuttle. American astronauts also traveled to Mir, learning from Russian 
experience about living and working in space for extended periods of time. In 
addition to knowledge transfer, the Space Shuttle-Mir program formalized a 
new spirit of international cooperation, replacing the previous years of bitter 
competition.

Journeys to Mars
Studying the Martian landscape and environment hasn’t come easily. 
Although there’ve been a few great successes (including the Mars Pathfinder 
mission in 1996, which successfully placed the Sojourner rover on the 
surface of the Red Planet), there’ve been some rather spectacular failures. 
Several missions to Mars in the 1990s failed for a number of reasons, leading 
to dashed expectations and an increasing sense of futility regarding Mars 
research. Was Mars, a planet of incredible interest to scientists because of 
its striking similarities to Earth and its possibilities for life, going to remain 
shrouded in mystery? Within the next decade, these questions and more 
would be answered. Head to Chapter 15 for all the details.
Exploration of the inner solar system
Although Mars remained an important goal for the American space program 
in the 1990s, NASA’s attention turned to several targets in the inner solar 
system in the last decade of the 20th century and the first decade of the 
21st century, as we explain in Chapter 16. The SOHO mission has returned 
valuable information about the Sun, and the Magellan and Venus Express 
missions have vastly increased scientists’ knowledge of the surface and 
atmosphere of Venus. Other recent missions have returned to the Moon and 
sought to unravel the mysteries of asteroids and comets.
Missions to the outer solar system
 
One of mankind’s primary goals in exploring outer space is determining to 
what extent life, past or present, can be found. When looking for life, the 
NASA motto is “follow the water” — where there’s water, there may be some 
form of life.
Scientists have several targets of primary interest in the search for life in the 
outer solar system, as we explain in Chapter 17. Jupiter and its moons were 
the focus of the Galileo mission in the 1990s, and significant discoveries 
about subsurface water came to light. From the late 1990s through the first 
decade of the 21st century, the Cassini mission, which carried the Huygens 
probe at one point, has made similar discoveries on Saturn’s moons. The 
more that’s known about life in the solar system, the closer scientists come 
to understanding more about the origins of humanity.

Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
Modern Space Exploration
We’ve been to the Moon (and back); we’ve explored the solar system; we’ve 
catalogued the cosmos — what else is there? Plenty, as it turns out. Space 
exploration in the 21st century continues the work of past missions, but it 
has also yielded groundbreaking new information about the universe. 
Powerful telescopes have captured breathtaking views of the cosmos, leading 
scientists to new understandings of humanity’s place in the universe. The 
International Space Station is laying the groundwork for an enduring human 
presence in space, and Mars exploration has grown more successful, as you 
can see in the following sections.
Space telescopes
Despite the success of the Apollo Moon missions, it’s not currently practical 
for humans to make extended visits to other space destinations. Fortunately, 
space telescopes help provide access to previously inaccessible parts of the 
universe. The Hubble Space Telescope is one of the best-known because it 
has taken some of the most-amazing pictures of celestial objects ever seen, 
but other space telescopes (such as the Spitzer Space Telescope and the 
Compton Gamma Ray Observatory) have returned their fair share of amazing 
data as well. See Chapter 18 for more on telescopes in space.
The International Space Station
Are space hotels but a glimpse into the far-distant future? Perhaps not — 
the International Space Station (ISS), a multicountry collaborative effort, has 
resulted in a series of modules that have supported a continuous human 
presence in orbit since late 2000.
 
Living and working in the ISS comes with a particular set of challenges, and 
the astronauts are making valuable scientific contributions with the experi-
ments they conduct onboard. Although the station is decidedly unglamorous 
and can’t accommodate untrained astronauts, it provides a basis upon which 
civilian forays into space might, in the future, be built. Flip to Chapter 19 for 
details on the ISS.
The latest views of Mars
Despite some early failures in visiting Mars, missions in the 21st century 
have been able to successfully start exploring the Red Planet. The best 
publicized of these missions were the Mars Exploration Rovers, which 
brought two wheeled, fully mechanized rovers (Spirit and Opportunity) to 

17
 Chapter 1: Space Exploration in a Nutshell
the Martian surface. They began their task of documenting the planet’s 
surface in unprecedented detail, and the phenomenal images they sent back 
home inspired even more interest in discovering the mysteries of Mars. 
Other ongoing Mars missions include orbiters that have produced stunning 
maps of the Red Planet’s surface; check out Chapter 20 for the full scoop.
Space Exploration in the Future
Even though NASA and other worldwide space agencies have designed and 
executed many successful missions, all of these accomplishments are but a 
fraction of the work involved in understanding the cosmos. New missions are 
constantly being planned — ones that will revisit interesting locations and 
explore new frontiers.
The next space missions to watch out for
Some robotic missions to watch out for include a return visit to Jupiter’s 
moon Europa, a mission on its way to Pluto, and a Japanese mission to 
return a sample of an asteroid to Earth. Missions are also planned to provide 
further details about Mars and to study the Moon with an eye toward future 
astronaut missions.
On the human spaceflight side, Project Constellation will replace the Space 
Shuttle with a new Crew Exploration Vehicle dubbed Orion. This capsule-
based system will allow astronauts to visit the International Space Station 
and eventually return to the Moon or head to Mars. Chapter 21 has details on 
many upcoming robotic and manned missions.
Increased access to space
If that yearly ski trip is starting to seem old and tired, you may soon have 
new options on the horizon. For those with the means (and we’re not talking 
chump change), purchasing a ticket into space is becoming a reality for the 
first time in the history of space exploration. Several wealthy individuals 
have done just that by paying millions of dollars, training and preparing with 
real astronauts, and taking a ride into space. Although space travel is beyond 
the means of most folks, prices may eventually come down enough to make 
spaceflight, or even a stay at a commercial space “hotel,” a possibility.
Of course, increased access to space doesn’t just refer to the advent of space 
tourism. As more and more countries over the years have been bitten by the 
space exploration bug, a third nation has emerged as a true space power. 
China launched its first taikonaut (the Chinese term for astronaut) into orbit 

18
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
in 2003, followed by a two-person mission in 2005 and a mission with a space-
walk in 2008. China has plans to develop its own space station and eventually 
send astronauts to the Moon, helping spark some renewed interest in lunar 
exploration back in the U.S. Could a new Space Race be in the works? 
Probably not, but a little healthy competition can be good for scientific 
innovation! Chapter 22 has all the details on space tourism, commercial 
spaceflight, and China’s new space program.
Reasons for continuing to explore space
 
Why continue to explore space? Why this fascination with the heavens when 
there are enough problems and diversions here on Earth? Space exploration 
can be seen as a continuation of humanity’s need to explore, to push the limits 
of the frontier. With future population pressures and the speedy consumption 
of natural resources, space exploration and colonization may one day become 
a necessity. In the far-distant future, when the Sun becomes unstable, space 
exploration may be vital to ensure the survival of the human race. Chapter 23 
goes into more detail on the many reasons why space exploration is still a 
worthy pursuit.

hat is a planet? How did early humans view the night sky? How did 
people determine mankind’s place in the solar system, and the 
universe, in an era before space exploration began? And what’s beyond the 
solar system? This chapter helps answer those basic questions and much 
more. We also describe the basic organization of the solar system and touch 
on the status of Pluto, once the ninth planet and now one of a group of bodies 
known as dwarf planets.
Planets as Wanderers: How Early 
Humans Viewed the Sky
In the earliest days of humanity’s fascination with the heavens, eagle-eyed 
observers noticed that although the patterns of the stars never changed, 
some points of light seemed to travel through them on a fixed path. These 
objects were called planets, from the Greek root planasthai, meaning 
“wanderers.” Such initial observations helped ancient astronomers track 
the seasons and, eventually, allowed for the revolutionary understanding of 
how the solar system is arranged. The Earth’s place in that solar system was, 
as you can imagine, one of the keenest points of interest.
In the following sections, we delve into the patterns of stars that early 
humans observed (now known as constellations) and a few important early 
discoveries about the layout of the solar system.

20
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
Constellations: Pictures in the sky
Astronomers, scientists who study the universe, organize the sky according 
to fixed constellations, or groups of stars and other heavenly bodies that 
are arranged in a particular way. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) 
recognizes 88 “official” constellations, which form a map of the entire sky 
when combined together (Figure 2-1 shows some constellations).
The basic European northern constellations originate in Greek mythology 
and were said to have been created by Zeus and his divine cohorts 
(according to myriad ancient Greek writers, that is). Homer, a poet who 
lived in the seventh century BCE, wrote of arrangements of stars resembling 
certain shapes, such as the Ram. Later, other ancient Greek authors wrote of 
star arrangements based on the gods and their antics. Not wanting to be left 
out, Roman authors such as Ptolemy (of the second century CE) catalogued 
the stars into at least 48 different constellations, some of which involved 
Roman mythology. Although this list was limited to those constellations that 
could be seen in the Northern Hemisphere, it formed the basis for today’s 
categorization.
In the following sections, we list a few of the most-famous constellations and 
describe the constellations of the zodiac.

Zeroing in on a few famous constellations
Some of the better-known Northern Hemisphere constellations include
 
✓ Cassiopeia: This constellation is visible year-round. Cassiopeia is named 
after the queen who nearly sacrificed her daughter Andromeda for her 
own vanity.
 
✓ Orion: Named after a mythological hunter born with the aid of Zeus 
and killed by a scorpion sent from Zeus’s jealous wife Hera, this 
constellation is identifiable by the three-starred Orion’s Belt. It’s visible 
high in the winter sky.
 
✓ Pegasus: This summer constellation consists of a number of stars that 
form the shape of a horse. Pegasus is named for the winged creature 
that sprung from the head of Medusa.
 
✓ Perseus: Named for the Greek mythological hero who slew Medusa, 
this constellation is visible in the winter sky. It’s related to fellow 
constellations Cassiopeia, Andromeda, Cepheus, and Cetus.
 
✓ Ursa Major: This constellation is visible year-round. Called the Great 
Bear in Navajo mythology, Ursa Major also includes the Big Dipper, an 
unofficial star grouping that has a very recognizable shape.
 
To find out more about the constellations, pick up the latest issue of Sky & 
Telescope magazine for its monthly star map, or visit the magazine’s Web site, 
www.skypub.com, for an interactive sky chart. The book Astronomy For 
Dummies is also a great resource for lots more info about the stars and how to 
observe them.
Traveling through the zodiac
When ancient astronomers first observed the planets, they also noticed that 
the wanderers seemed to travel through a set of 12 constellations. These 12 
constellations made up the ancient Babylonian system of navigation in which 
each station was given an animal sign. This system was later called the 
zodiac, which meant “circle of animals” in Greek. Over time, these cultures 
created a calendar where each constellation corresponded approximately to 
one month of the year.
Why don’t constellations move?
The stars in constellations are always fixed with 
respect to each other. The whole sky, complete 
with constellations, appears to rise and fall 
each night with the rotation of the Earth, but the 
shapes of the constellations themselves remain 
constant. The orientation of the stars, as seen 
from the Earth, doesn’t change, because the 
stars are so far away from the Earth. They form 
a fixed backdrop against which the objects in 
our own solar system — the planets — move 
each night.

22
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
Different countries around the world have different zodiacs. For example, the 
western one is unlike the traditional Chinese zodiac, which is also unlike the 
Hindu or Celtic versions. The 12 signs of the western zodiac are as follows:
 
✓ Aries
 
✓ Taurus
 
✓ Gemini
 
✓ Cancer
 
✓ Leo
 
✓ Virgo
 
✓ Libra
 
✓ Scorpio
 
✓ Sagittarius
 
✓ Capricorn
 
✓ Aquarius
 
✓ Pisces
 
These 12 signs of the zodiac make up what’s called the Ecliptic, which is the 
plane of the solar system as seen on the sky. The solar system is laid out like 
concentric circles on a flat plane, with the Sun at the center and the planets 
moving in ever-increasing circles around it. When someone on Earth looks 
to the sky and observes the solar system’s other planets, those planets are 
much closer than the fixed stars that make up the constellations. The planets 
therefore appear to move with respect to the constellations and drift through 
the Ecliptic plane, whose background is the 12 signs of the zodiac.
Is Earth the center of the universe? Early 
discoveries about the solar system
Early views of the solar system’s design assumed that the Earth was at the 
center of the cosmos. After all, the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars all appeared 
to rise and set each day and seemed to circle the Earth. Why shouldn’t the 
Earth be front and center on the universe’s stage?
At the time, such a layout made theological sense because it reinforced 
humanity’s view of the Earth as “special.” This geocentric, or Earth-centered, 
view of the universe was supported by both mainstream science and (thanks 
to various powerful churches of the 16th century) religion. However, several 
scientists in the 1500s and 1600s disputed this view with scientific discover-
ies; we describe two of the most-important findings in the following sections.
Copernicus: Constructing a heliocentric view
 
One of the founding fathers of modern astronomy, Nicolaus Copernicus, 
made waves for his rejection of the Earth as the literal center of the universe. 
Based on an elegant theoretical model of the geometry of the solar system 
and the motions of the planets, he eventually came up with the idea that the 

23
 Chapter 2: A Tour of the Universe
Sun was at the center of the solar system, not the Earth. Copernicus first 
presented his heliocentric theory around 1510 in a preliminary thesis that was 
never published.
He later expounded upon this thesis in a work called De revolutionibus 
orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), which wasn’t 
published until 1543, the year of his death. Most people think that Copernicus 
delayed publishing his ideas because he was afraid to go against the powerful 
religious forces of the day — then again, he could also have just feared 
looking foolish.
Galileo: Building on Copernicus’s work
Astronomers after Copernicus continued his work, but none did so more 
faithfully than Galileo Galilei, born in 1564. An Italian astronomer, mathemati-
cian, physicist, and all-around scientist, Galileo was one of the first scientists 
to provide a mathematical description for the laws of nature. He also 
contributed significantly to society’s understanding of the physics of motion.
 
Galileo designed enhanced telescopes (think of ’em as the Hubble Space 
Telescope of the Renaissance period) that were the most powerful of the day 
and that allowed him to perform the most-detailed astronomical observations 
of the time, including a study of Jupiter’s moons. By using his telescopes, 
Galileo was able to identify lunar topography, observe the phases of Venus, 
and make detailed notes about stars and their positions over time. His studies 
also convinced him that the geocentric theory of planetary orbit was wrong, 
and he expressed vocal support for the heliocentric theory espoused by 
Copernicus. However, the Catholic Church persecuted him for teaching these 
beliefs and committed him to house arrest toward the end of his life.
The Organization of the Solar System
If you want to understand how the solar system is organized, we suggest you 
begin at the beginning — the formation of the Sun and planets. The modern 
scientific view of the origin of the solar system (and universe) isn’t quite up 
to biblical standards, but it’s still spectacular.
Astronomers believe it all began 4.6 billion years ago, when a giant molecular 
cloud of gas and dust began to collapse. What triggered the collapse of this 
cloud is still in question, but it may have been a shock wave caused by the 
explosion of a nearby star in the molecular cloud that started another corner 
of the cloud collapsing.
What is known is that after parts of the molecular cloud began sticking 
together, the whole process started to pick up speed due to the influence of 
gravity. Gravity is a fairly weak force over long distances, but as the cloud 
collapsed and became denser and denser, the gravitational attraction of the 

24
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
particles in the cloud, now called the presolar nebula, made this collapse 
increase in speed. As the nebula caved in, it began to spin to conserve 
angular momentum (we’ll spare you the nitty-gritty details of this property 
of physics!). The presolar nebula subsided into a flat, spinning disk of gas 
and dust called a protoplanetary disk, with our solar system’s protosun at 
the center.
 
It probably took about 100,000 years, very short on cosmic timescales, for the 
gas and dust at the center of the protoplanetary disk to balance the force of 
gravitational collapse with the pressure of the hot gas. After 50 million years 
or so, the protostar’s center reached extreme enough conditions of tempera-
ture and pressure to allow nuclear fusion to occur, and the protostar became 
a full-fledged star, fusing hydrogen molecules together to make helium.
As the cloud collapsed, material in the protoplanetary disk began to clump 
together (you can thank gravity again for that one). There wasn’t enough 
material to make another star, but there was plenty to make a solar system 
full of bodies called planetesimals. These smaller bodies kept crashing into 
each other and sticking together, forming larger and larger bodies. By the 
time the Sun was near the conditions required for it to burn hydrogen, its 
energy output was blowing much of the leftover material out of the solar 
system.
Over time, the objects in the inner solar system (near the Sun) formed the 
four terrestrial planets you know and love — Mercury, Venus, Earth, and 
Mars. Conditions in the inner solar system were still very hot, due to the 
bright young Sun, and it was too hot for materials such as ices and other 
easily evaporated compounds to stick around. For this reason, the planets 
of the inner solar system are made mostly of rock and metal.
Out somewhere beyond the orbit of Mars is what astronomers call the snow 
line, the distance from the early Sun at which ice could finally condense 
out of the remnants of the protoplanetary disk (now called the solar nebula). 
At this great distance from the Sun, ices formed rapidly and were swept up 
into what became the giant planet Jupiter, which quickly grew large enough 
to start capturing hydrogen gas from the solar nebula. Jupiter, composed 
primarily of hydrogen gas, is the largest planet in the solar system. Saturn, 
the next planet out from the Sun, is similar to Jupiter in composition but 
much smaller.
Beyond Saturn lie Uranus and Neptune, which are sometimes called ice giants 
to distinguish them from the gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn. Uranus and 
Neptune contain much more water, ammonia, and methane ices than Jupiter 
and Saturn, because they were formed in regions farther from the Sun and 
thus are even colder.
Past Neptune are the farthest reaches of the solar system, which contain 
primordial remnants from the solar nebula. Pluto, formerly known as the 
ninth planet, lurks in this dim region, accompanied by a large number of 

25
 Chapter 2: A Tour of the Universe
cold, icy bodies known as Kuiper Belt Objects. (We clue you in to the Pluto 
saga later in this chapter.) Beyond the Kuiper Belt lies an even more remote 
region of the solar system: the Oort Cloud, a swarm of icy bodies that 
envelops the flat solar system like a blanket.
 
Both the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud are the sources of the occasional 
comet that wanders into the inner solar system and beautifully lights up the 
night sky. As these icy objects approach the Sun, some of their ice gets heated 
up and turns into gas, which trails behind the small ice-ball like the train of a 
bridal gown in a spectacular finish. Not bad for such small, icy bodies from the 
unfashionable reaches of the solar system!
This formation process resulted in the modern, orderly solar system in which 
planets travel around the Sun on nearly circular orbits and basically lie in a 
flat plane. The solar system is made up of 8 planets, 3 (and probably more) 
dwarf planets, a large number of small bodies (which include asteroids and 
comets), and more than 130 satellites (objects that orbit the planets). Check 
out the solar system’s organization in Figure 2-2 and discover more about the 
different areas of the system in the following sections.

Rock on: The inner solar system
The solar system features four inner, rocky planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth, 
and Mars —that are sometimes called the terrestrial planets because of their 
basic similarity to Earth. But even though these planets are of similar sizes, 
they vary in appearance. Following are some key details on the planets of the 
inner solar system:

26
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
 
✓ Mercury: The closest planet to the Sun, Mercury is named after the 
Roman travel and messenger god. Its hot surface is scarred with ancient 
lava flows and covered with impact craters. It rotates slowly in what’s 
called a resonance — Mercury rotates three times on its axis (days) 
in two trips around the Sun (years). It has a very high density, which 
suggests that only heavy metallic elements could’ve condensed into the 
material that eventually formed Mercury so near to the Sun. Mercury is 
the smallest of the eight planets; it’s even smaller than the moons Titan 
and Ganymede.
 
✓ Venus: Sometimes referred to as Earth’s sister planet, Venus is named 
after the Roman goddess of beauty due to its bright appearance. 
However, its thick clouds hide a surface that’s anything but gentle and 
welcoming: The planet’s thick atmosphere means that surface tempera-
tures are hot enough to melt lead! You won’t find water on the surface of 
Venus, just mountains, lava flows, and a few impact craters.
 
✓ Earth: Home to plants, animals, people, and an insane number of 
reality TV shows, Earth is the largest terrestrial planet. From space, 
its appearance is dominated by clouds and oceans, with scattered 
continents. Earth is located at such a distance from the Sun that water, 
a key requirement for life as we know it, is actually stable in all three 
phases — solid ice, liquid water, and gaseous water vapor. Earth’s active 
surface is covered with many different geological features due to the 
workings of water, air, volcanoes, and plate tectonics. Earth has one 
large satellite, the Moon, which scientists think formed when a Mars-
sized object smashed into the Earth early in the solar system’s history, 
sending material out into space that eventually formed the Moon.
 
✓ Mars: Named after the Roman god of war for its red appearance, Mars 
is larger than Mercury but smaller than Venus. A cold, old world today 
with a thin atmosphere that makes water stable only in the polar ice 
caps, Mars may once have been much warmer and wetter. Spacecraft 
images show that Mars’s surface is covered by features that appear to 
have been carved by liquid water. Mars is home to the largest volcano in 
the solar system and a huge canyon that would stretch from California 
to the East Coast of the United States if placed on Earth. Mars also 
has two tiny satellites, Phobos and Deimos, which are likely captured 
asteroids (former residents of the asteroid belt that strayed a bit too 
close to the gravity of the Red Planet).
Asteroids: Filling in the gaps
Between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter lies the main asteroid belt. Asteroids 
are mostly small, primitive bodies left over from the formation of the solar 
system. These small bodies possess regular orbits around the Sun but are 

27
 Chapter 2: A Tour of the Universe
much too small to be planets. A few hundred thousand asteroids have been 
discovered so far, but when added all together, their mass is still less than 
that of the Moon.
Many asteroids are irregularly shaped, but some are sizable enough to be 
largely round. Most meteorites that hit the Earth come from the asteroid 
belt, and scientists can compare the chemical composition of meteorites in 
a laboratory to observations of asteroids taken with a telescope to try and 
determine where different meteorites came from.
Great balls of gas (and ice): The giants 
of the outer solar system
Beyond the asteroid belt lie the outer planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and 
Neptune. Sometimes referred to as the giant planets, these large balls of gas 
and ice are much larger than the inner planets and contain most of the non-
solar mass of the solar system. Here’s the scoop on the various outer planets:
 
✓ Jupiter: Named after the Roman king of the gods, Jupiter is certainly 
the king of the planets — it contains more mass than all the rest of the 
planets in the solar system combined! Made up mostly of hydrogen with 
about 10 percent helium, Jupiter probably has a small rocky core near 
its center. The planet is known for the Great Red Spot, a huge storm 
(larger than the Earth), that has been seen from Earth for more than 300 
years. Like any good king, Jupiter has its subjects in the form of at least 
63 moons. Four of them, the Galilean satellites, are large and regular; the 
rest are small.
 
✓ Saturn: The solar system’s second-largest planet, Saturn, is named after 
the Roman god of agriculture. It’s made mostly of hydrogen and helium 
and is so low in density that it would actually float in water if you could 
find enough. Saturn’s rings are its most-breathtaking feature. They 
spread to twice the planet’s diameter but are only about 1 kilometer 
thick and consist mostly of small particles of water ice and ice-coated 
rock. Saturn has at least 34 satellites, the most interesting of which are 
Titan (with its thick atmosphere) and Enceladus (which has geysers).
 
✓ Uranus: The seventh planet from the Sun, Uranus is named after the 
Greek sky god and is in fact as blue as the sky. It’s larger (but less 
massive) than Neptune and made up of rock and ice. Its hydrogen-and-
helium atmosphere is much less immense than the atmospheres of 
Jupiter and Saturn. Uranus is the only planet in the solar system to 
rotate on its side: The rotation axis of most planets is perpendicular 
to the plane of the solar system, with North pointing up, but Uranus’s 
rotation axis is parallel to the plane of the solar system. The planet has 
21 known moons and a small ring system.

28
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
 
✓ Neptune: Named for the Roman god of the ocean, Neptune has a deep 
blue color to match and a composition that’s similar to Uranus’s. The 
planet has a dark ring system and one large moon, Triton, as well as at 
least 12 other moons that are small and irregular. Triton orbits around 
Neptune backwards from most other moons in the solar system and is 
thought to probably be a captured object from the farthest reaches of 
the solar system. Triton even has small volcanic plumes!
Talk about drama: The great Pluto debate
Any schoolchild of a certain age will tell you that the solar system is made 
up of nine planets. Heck, she may even be able to name them all in order. 
However, the definition of a planet isn’t quite as obvious as it seems, espe-
cially at the small end of the spectrum. The structure of our solar system 
features four small inner plants, four large outer planets, and an assortment 
of leftover debris beyond the orbit of Neptune. These leftovers range in size 
from the planet formerly known as Pluto down to much smaller objects.
For 75 years, Pluto, as the largest, brightest, and closest of these far-outer-
solar-system objects, was recognized as a planet. In the first decade of the 
21st century, however, studies of the outer solar system revealed that one 
or more large objects may exist beyond the orbit of Pluto that could be 
Pluto-sized or even larger. Astronomers rushed to redefine what constitutes 
a planet, and in 2006, they came up with a decision that has forced people 
around the world to revisit some basic facts about the solar system.
In the long run, this reclassification will provide a more-consistent picture of 
the planets. For now, we describe Pluto’s history and the category of dwarf 
planets in the following sections.
Flashing back through the history of Pluto
Pluto was on astronomers’ radar for about 90 years before it was officially 
discovered. Early astronomers noticed something in the area of Neptune 
and Uranus that appeared to be interfering with their orbits. They couldn’t 
define the source of that interference but suspected it might be a planet 
(considering Neptune had previously been found due to interference with the 
orbit of Uranus).
In 1906, astronomer Percival Lowell, from a rich manufacturing family, took 
up the challenge to search for the ninth planet. He built a large observatory, 
called Lowell Observatory and located near Flagstaff, Arizona, and devoted 
himself to searching the heavens. (On a side note, Lowell was known for his 
observations of Mars, where he thought he saw canals built by intelligent 
life.) Lowell died in 1916, but the observatory staff continued searching the 
heavens, and in 1930, Clyde Tombaugh definitively confirmed the presence 
of what was first called Planet X. This object was eventually renamed Pluto 
and became the solar system’s ninth planet.

29
 Chapter 2: A Tour of the Universe
 
In keeping with the mythological names given to other planets in the solar 
system, Pluto is named after the ancient Roman god of the underworld (known 
as Hades in Greek mythology). Another reason for the choice may have been 
that Pluto contains the initials of Percival Lowell, initials that are also reflected 
in Pluto’s symbol, which includes the letters P and L.
Ironically, although Pluto was found after models of planetary orbits pre-
dicted that something was influencing the orbit of Neptune, Pluto itself 
was too small in size to have had the predicted effect. Astronomers later 
determined that Neptune’s mass had been overestimated — with the proper 
mass of Neptune, no extra planet is necessary. Pluto’s discovery was thus a 
lucky mistake.
Examining what it means to be a planet — 
and why Pluto doesn’t make the cut
Although the definition of a planet seems intuitively obvious, astronomers 
have had a surprisingly difficult time coming up with a planetary definition 
that includes only what are known to be planets and doesn’t include extra 
objects such as asteroids and comets.
 
The definition of a planet has changed substantially over time. Ancient Greek 
astronomers defined planets as wandering stars, or celestial bodies that moved 
consistently during the year. The Greeks were aware of what would later be 
named Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, but they also considered 
the Sun and Moon to be planets. Renaissance astronomy, particularly the 
heliocentric theory that we present earlier in this chapter, removed the Sun 
and Moon from the list of planets. In later years, astronomers added Neptune, 
Uranus, and Pluto to the solar system’s planetary lineup.
 
The primary reason why Pluto currently fails to qualify as a planet has to do 
with its orbit. Pluto’s orbit is elliptical, meaning it’s shaped like an egg rather 
than a circle. According to the International Astronomical Union (IAU)’s 2006 
definition, planets must have orbits that don’t overlap with those of other 
planets. In other words, a planet must orbit the Sun and also be big enough to 
dominate the immediate area surrounding its orbit. Pluto’s orbit crosses 
Neptune’s orbit, so according to the IAU logic, Pluto could no longer be con-
sidered a planet.
Another scientific requirement for a planet is that it possesses sufficient 
internal gravitation to be round. A planet with enough mass reaches a hydro-
static equilibrium, meaning everything on its surface is at about the same 
distance from the center. Pluto is relatively round, but perhaps not enough 
so to meet this new, more-stringent definition. In fact, this particular point 
met with great contention from astronomers who wanted to maintain Pluto’s 
planetary status.

30
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
Defining dwarf planets
 
So if Pluto is no longer a planet, what is it? It’s a dwarf planet! In its 2006 plane-
tary definition, the IAU also created a new dwarf-planet category. Dwarf plan-
ets are objects that orbit the Sun, are large enough to be round but are smaller 
than Mercury, and can orbit the Sun in a zone with lots of other objects. Three 
dwarf planets are currently known to exist:
 
✓ Pluto, which orbits in the Kuiper Belt
 
✓ Ceres, which orbits in the asteroid belt
 
✓ Eris, which is located in the Kuiper Belt
 
Here’s some info that may help you win your hometown trivia night some 
day (and if you do, we’d be happy to go in on the winnings with you): Eris, 
discovered in 2006, was the object that caused all the hubbub in planetary 
definitions. Turns out Eris is actually larger than Pluto! For a while, Eris was 
dubbed the tenth planet, but astronomers soon started worrying about how 
many more planets might be lurking in the far reaches of the solar system. The 
new dwarf-planet category handily creates a place to put Pluto, Eris, and any 
future objects discovered in the region.
Extrasolar Planets and Stars 
and Galaxies, Oh My!
When you look up at the night sky in a dark place, you can see many points of 
light. They may all look the same to the naked eye, but astronomers have 
determined that these objects can be very different from each other. The 
planets in our solar system circle the Sun, which is a star like many of the 
other stars seen in the night sky. Guess what? Many of those stars may have 
their own planets circling them, too. Every star you see in the sky is part of 
the Milky Way Galaxy, which is made up of 300 billion stars and is about 
100,000 light years across. The Milky Way Galaxy is but one of billions of gal-
axies that comprise the universe. Find out more about extrasolar planets, 
stars, and galaxies in the following sections.
Extrasolar planets
The solar system is the Sun and other objects (planets, dwarf planets, 
asteroids, comets, and other small bodies) that are connected to it by 
gravity. Extrasolar planets, also called exoplanets, are planets found outside 
the solar system. Currently, astronomers recognize more than 300 extrasolar 
planets orbiting other stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Many of these planets 
are thought to be enormous gaseous balls similar in nature to Jupiter, but 
some are as small as only a few times the mass of the Earth.

31
 Chapter 2: A Tour of the Universe
 
Knowledge and understanding of extrasolar planets is critical to space explo-
ration because it allows astronauts to discover more about the extent of the 
universe. Since the time of Copernicus and Galileo (whom we touch on earlier 
in this chapter), humanity has had a sneaking suspicion that “we” (meaning 
the solar system) can’t possibly comprise the full extent of the universe. The 
entire field of extrasolar-planet research, in fact, relies on the assumption that 
this solar system isn’t the only one out there. Discovering extrasolar planets 
both confirms that assumption and provides insight into where they are and 
what they’re made of.
As recently as ten years ago, our solar system was the only example of a 
planetary system that astronomers knew about with absolute certainty. 
Recently, an explosion of observational data has begun to definitively detect 
planets surrounding other stars. The first extrasolar planets found were 
mostly large planets located close to their stars, because larger planets are 
easiest to detect from Earth. More-recent studies have been finding smaller 
and smaller planets. Future dedicated spacecraft, like the upcoming Kepler 
mission (see Chapter 21), hope to finally detect Earth-like planets around 
other stars.
Homes of the stars
The Sun is a familiar sight to anyone who has ever stepped outside. It’s 
readily visible in the daytime sky on Earth, but it’s actually a star like the 
other stars in the night sky. It seems to be much bigger and brighter than 
those other stars, and that perception results from the fact that it’s so 
much closer to the Earth.
So what exactly are stars? At their most fundamental, stars are balls of gas 
that maintain their cohesiveness via gravity and generate energy through 
nuclear fusion. Stars are very hot in the center where they burn hydrogen 
into helium and give off electromagnetic radiation, some of which can be 
seen as visible light. Stars vary in color due to this difference in heat energy; 
some appear whitish, whereas others appear bluish or yellowish. Stars 
look to be in fixed positions, but they’re actually in constant motion, just like 
the planets.
Stars are formed in gas clouds called nebulae. As turbulence builds up inside 
a nebula, gas at the center of the turbulence heats up and the cloud begins to 
fold in on itself. The cloud eventually collapses, forming a star. The extra 
dust around the star may become part of the star, or it may go on to become 
an asteroid, comet, or planet. Growing a star isn’t a quick process; the Sun 
took about 50 million years to reach the level of an adult star, and scientists 
think it’ll live a long adult life — about 10 billion years.

32
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
Galaxies galore
If you step outside on a dark night, particularly in a remote location far from 
cities and streetlights, you may see a bright band of stars spanning the sky. 
A familiar sight to prehistoric cultures, these days that band has an official 
name — the Milky Way Galaxy — because of its white, diffuse appearance. 
This bright band of light and stars is home to Earth. It’s flat, like a disk, and 
has a spiral structure when viewed from above. The Sun is located in one of 
the spiral arms of the Milky Way Galaxy, which is just one of many galaxies in 
the universe.
 
Galaxies can be loosely defined as stars, dust, black holes, gas, and other 
forms of matter that are united by gravity. A significant number of galaxies 
exist in the universe; early Hubble Space Telescope studies place the estimate 
at around 125 billion. (See Chapters 14 and 18 for more about Hubble.) 
Galaxies can range in size from small (perhaps 10 million stars) to large 
(with a trillion or more stars), and they come in several different shapes:
 
✓ Spiral galaxies have whiplike, curved arms.
 
✓ Elliptical galaxies are oblong.
 
✓ Irregular galaxies can have a range of other shapes.
The Milky Way Galaxy contains the Sun and planets, plus about 300 billion 
additional stars. Included among these extra stars are star clusters (either 
bound or related groups of stars) and nebulae (collections of gas and dust 
that can be the birthing places for stars). Known nebulae and star clusters in 
the galaxy are listed in the Messier database, a listing first created by an 
astronomer named Charles Messier; he was searching for comets but ended 
up making a list of everything he observed that wasn’t a comet. All the 
objects he identified received a Messier number, and these numbers are still 
used today for nebulae, clusters, galaxies, and other star groupings.
Modern astronomers have determined that many of the fuzzy patches of light 
originally called nebulae are in fact distant galaxies. One of the most famous, 
formerly the Andromeda Nebula, is now known to be the Andromeda Galaxy, 
one of the closest galaxies to the Milky Way. It’s 2.5 million light years away, 
meaning it takes light 2.5 million years to travel from Andromeda to Earth. 
Check out an image of the Andromeda Galaxy in the color section; note that 
the spiral arms, made up of millions of stars, give it a similar appearance to 
our own Milky Way Galaxy (where our solar system is located in a spiral arm).

or a successful space mission, you need three key elements:
 
✓ Something to get your spacecraft into orbit
 
✓ Some way to move the spacecraft to its destination after it reaches 
space
 
✓ Some way to power the spacecraft during its journey
Rockets, those elegant and powerful cylinders, are what guide people and 
robotic spacecraft into space. They also traditionally serve as propulsion 
systems for spacecraft post-liftoff so the satellite, Space Shuttle, you name 
it, can reach its destination. Rockets represent some of mankind’s most-
advanced technological creations. From their relatively humble beginnings 
in the realm of ancient firecrackers to the larger-than-life Saturn V, rockets 
may have changed in scale and application but they still rely on the same 
basic principles of physics.
Of course, the spacecraft that rockets carry into orbit around Earth or 
beyond have their own power requirements. And given the distances 
that spacecraft must travel, calling home is a lot more difficult than a long-
distance phone call. Communications between space and Earth require an 
advanced network of radio antennae and, fortunately, such a system already 
exists today.

Back in Time: A Quick Tour 
of Rockets in History
From ancient Chinese fireworks to modern ballistic missiles, the develop-
ment of rockets has had both military and scientific implications. Here’s 
a quick rocket-history timeline (we describe the major landmarks in detail 
in the following sections):
1st century CE: The ancient Greeks create a steam-powered, rocketlike 
engine.
12th century CE: The Chinese invent fireworks and military rockets.
1608: Galileo creates his first telescope (see Chapter 2 for details).
1687: Isaac Newton formulates laws of motion, which describe how 
rockets can move forward by ejecting mass backward at high speed.
1820: Rockets are used militarily throughout Europe.
1926: Robert Goddard, an American, launches the first liquid-fueled 
rocket.
1942: Germans launch the first V-2 rocket, otherwise known as the first 
suborbital ballistic missile, which was used in World War II.
1949: Americans launch the first Viking rocket, which was based on 
designs of captured V-2 rockets.
1953: NASA engineers complete the Redstone rocket.
1957: Soviets launch Sputnik 1, the world’s first artificial satellite.
1958: Americans launch Explorer 1, the first U.S. satellite sent around 
Earth.
1961: Soviets launch the Vostok program and send the first human to 
space.
1961: NASA’s Project Mercury sends the first American into space.
1966: Soviets achieve the first soft lunar landing with Luna 9.
1968–1972: Americans use Saturn V rockets to send Apollo spacecraft to 
the Moon.
1973: Americans launch Skylab, the first U.S. space station.
1981–2010: NASA Space Shuttles employ reusable solid rocket boosters.

 Chapter 3: Yes, It’s Rocket (And Spacecraft) Science After All
The earliest creations and uses
The modern rocket was a long time coming. The first known device similar to 
a rocket dates back to the first century CE. It was then that Hero, a Hellenistic 
Greek from Alexandria, invented a steam-powered engine called the aeolipile, 
which was similar to a rocket engine. It’s unclear, however, whether this 
device was ever fully implemented.
As time progressed, military needs in particular drove early rocket develop-
ment. For instance, the Chinese used rockets for warfare during the 12th 
century CE. Rockets also played a role during wars of the 20th century CE, 
particularly during World War I, when they were mounted to airplanes in 
order to deliver explosives to ground- or air-based targets.
 
The main predecessor to the modern space rocket was developed by an 
American named Robert Goddard. He designed and launched the first liquid-
fueled rocket in 1926 because he was interested in space travel. Although this 
first rocket (named Nell) made it a mere 41 feet (12 meters) into the air, 
Goddard continued making advances in both speed and distance until his 
death in 1945.
Experts in other countries, including Wernher von Braun and Dr. Hermann 
Oberth in Germany; Fridik Tsander and Sergei Korolev in Russia; and many 
others, conducted experiments with liquid-fueled rockets in the 1940s. Such 
experiments led to the development of the German V-2 rocket, which was 
capable of reaching the edge of space and served as a formidable weapon 
during World War II.
Advances in the 1950s, 
1960s, and 1970s
One of the most-significant early military applications of rocketry was the 
Redstone rocket, whose first launch occurred in 1953 at Cape Canaveral Air 
Force Station, Florida. Working out of Huntsville, Alabama, German scientist 
Wernher von Bruan and his team created this liquid-fueled missile that used 
oxygen and alcohol to generate a 75,000-pound thrust. (Thrust is the force 
necessary for an object to take flight, defy gravity, and move through space; 
we describe a rocket’s thrust more fully later in this chapter.) The Redstone 
measured approximately 70 feet (21 meters) long and had a speed of about 
3,800 miles (6,100 kilometers) per hour during burnout, the period at which 
propellant (the combination of a fuel and an oxidizer that powers a rocket) 
has been completely exhausted. Intended as a defense mechanism during the 
Cold War years, the U.S. Army started using the Redstone rocket in 1958.
As technology and science continued to advance, new and better rockets 
made their way into use, and peaceful applications were developed for 
military missiles. The first American satellite sent around the Earth, Explorer 

36
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
1, was launched in 1958. Designed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 
California, Explorer 1 was launched by the Jupiter-C rocket vehicle, a modi-
fied version of the earlier Redstone rocket and an assembly that consisted 
of ballistic missile technology. The Jupiter-C rocket was assembled in four 
stages, with the largest and heaviest (Stage 1) having a thrust of 83,000 
pounds and a burn time of 155 seconds. (Burn time refers to how long the 
rocket burns its propellant.)
Later years saw rockets, specifically the Saturn series of rockets, used for 
human space exploration. Primarily developed in the 1960s by scientists who 
had emigrated from Germany to the U.S., the Saturn rockets were first pro-
posed for launching military satellites. They went on to become the main 
launch vehicles for Project Apollo, NASA’s foray into lunar exploration.
 
The largest rocket built during this time was the Saturn V. Nicknamed the 
Moon Rocket, the Saturn V was a liquid-fueled rocket used between 1967 and 
1973 by both Project Apollo and Skylab, the first U.S. space station, and it 
remains the world’s most powerful rocket ever by payload (the cargo that 
the rocket carries into space). The Saturn V was built in three stages, separate 
portions of a rocket that burn to completion and are then discarded. Standing 
an impressive 363 feet (110 meters) tall, the Saturn V helped make human 
spaceflight possible.
During the 1950s and 1960s, rockets changed greatly in size. Figure 3-1 shows 
the progression of rocket sizes throughout the years.

Starting to recycle in the 1980s
Rockets were traditionally disposable items designed to be discarded after a 
single use. However, the Space Shuttle, first launched in 1981, was designed 
with some reusable parts. Its smaller solid rocket boosters are designed to 
fall into the ocean after their fuel is exhausted; these boosters are retrieved, 
cleaned, refilled, and used again on future missions. Each booster can be 
used for several missions before it has to be retired. Employing reusable 
boosters theoretically allows a spacecraft to be launched more often and at 
a lower cost than using rockets that must be replaced completely after 
each launch.
 
The Space Shuttle orbiter itself is, of course, reusable as well. Those in the 
current NASA fleet have a lifetime of many dozens of launches. In fact, the 
oldest Space Shuttle still in the fleet, Discovery, has been traveling into orbit 
since 1984 — well beyond its expected lifetime.
Let’s Get Physics-al: How Rockets 
Lift Off and Travel through Space
All things being equal, spacecraft would prefer to stay right where they 
are on the ground, thank you very much. They need substantial initial 
energy to overcome gravity and lift off of the Earth’s surface. That’s where 
rocket engines come into play. In the following sections, we explain the 
forces that propel (and hinder) a rocket’s liftoff from Earth and its movement 
through space.
 
Knowing how a rocket is built can help you understand how it lifts off and 
travels through space. Figure 3-2 shows the following essential parts of a 
rocket:
 
✓ Rocket engines: These powerful engines, usually located at the bottom 
of the rocket, provide the thrust that allows the rocket to escape Earth’s 
gravity.
 
✓ Booster rockets: When a main rocket engine can’t provide enough thrust 
for the rocket to reach orbit, booster rockets (also called strap-ons) can 
be added to provide some extra oomph, particularly at liftoff. Booster 
rockets are visible as the smaller rockets to the side of the main rocket 
in Figure 3-1, in particular the Space Shuttle and Ares V.
 
✓ Propellant tanks: Rockets burn through an amazing amount of fuel and 
oxidizer (which create propellant when combined) extremely quickly. 
Consequently, they require giant tanks. The propellant tanks are labeled 
as “fuel tank” and “oxidizer tank” in Figure 3-2.

38
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
 
✓ Tail fins: These small wings at the base of the rocket help stabilize it on 
its upward journey through the atmosphere.
 
✓ Nose cone: Shaped like a rounded cone, this part of a rocket sits at the 
very top and helps make the rocket’s shape more aerodynamic during 
launch. The nose cone is located at the top of the escape rocket and 
tower in Figure 3-2.
 
✓ Payload: This is the satellite, spacecraft, or other component (in other 
words, the cargo) that the rocket carries into space. A rocket is usually 
much larger than the payload it carries. In Figure 3-2, the payload is the 
small Mercury capsule near the top.

Understanding the main thrust of the issue
 
The main physics concept underlying a rocket engine is thrust, or the force 
necessary for an object to take flight, defy gravity, and move through space. A 
thrust force must be generated (usually by a propulsion system) in order for 
motion to occur. In the case of a rocket engine, gases are accelerated to the 
point where they can be expelled from the bottom of the engine. In English, 
that means massive amounts of propellant are burned and then discharged at 
a very high speed. This process generates the high level of thrust required for 
a rocket to achieve vertical motion.

39
 Chapter 3: Yes, It’s Rocket (And Spacecraft) Science After All
Rocket propellants are designed to burn fast — without exploding, mind you, 
because an actual explosion would be counterproductive at best and disas-
trous at worst. All rocket propellants are based on combining a fuel and an 
oxidizer, which burn in the vacuum of space. Missiles and fall-away rocket 
boosters may use solid propellants, which can be efficient for certain pur-
poses (such as long storage) but don’t allow much control over the engine 
itself. After the rocket is ignited, it essentially can’t be turned off until all the 
propellant is used up. Liquid propellants are generally used in cases where 
stopping and starting the engines is necessary; they combine a fuel source, 
such as liquid hydrogen, with an oxidizing agent, such as liquid oxygen. (For 
more on the different types of propellant, see the related section later in this 
chapter.)
Examining the forces of nature 
that affect liftoff
 
Five forces come into play when a rocket engine is attempting liftoff, and most 
of them are trying their best to keep that rocket on the ground:
 
✓ Weight: The first force that must be overcome is the weight of the 
rocket plus all of its propellant. Weight always points down toward the 
center of the Earth because it’s related to the force of gravity.
 
✓ Gravity: Gravity is the natural attraction of all objects toward the center 
of the Earth (or whatever planet you happen to be standing on), and 
it’s what keeps your feet firmly planted on the ground until you choose 
otherwise.
 
✓ Thrust: Thrust, which counteracts weight, is what’s produced when the 
rocket engine starts. It’s related to how much propellant is flowing 
through the engine, as well as the specific chemical properties of the 
fuel-and-oxidizer combination. The thrust force is lined up with the long 
axis of the rocket. (See the preceding section for the full scoop on 
thrust.)
 
✓ Drag: Drag is the force you’ve experienced if you’ve ever gone swim-
ming; it’s a motion-dependent force exerted against any objects that 
move through fluid or air. Drag acts against the object’s motion, 
meaning it serves to impede the motion of an airborne rocket. Larger 
objects, as in those with more surface area, experience increased drag.
 
✓ Lift: The lift force — usually not a factor in rocket operations — helps 
stabilize the upward movement of an object, such as an airplane, bird, 
or anything else that flies. Lift operates perpendicularly to drag, and it 
works to help control a rocket’s motion.

A rocket flight, whether it’s into the Earth’s orbit or to a farther destination, 
such as the Moon, has a number of different phases:
 
✓ First, the rocket must leave Earth’s surface. The familiar countdown of 
“3 . . . 2 . . . 1 . . . Blast off!” heralds the rocket carrying the spacecraft 
lifting off from the launch pad. Slow at first, the rocket quickly picks up 
speed and is soon gone from sight.
 
✓ For a vehicle traveling at an angle or without sufficient speed to escape 
Earth’s gravity, the rocket travels on what’s known as a ballistic 
trajectory and curves in a graceful arc until it eventually returns to the 
Earth’s surface. (Usually two or three stages are needed for the rocket 
to be able to leave Earth’s gravity and make it into space.) For a vehicle 
destined to orbit the Earth, the rocket must reach escape velocity, 
which is about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) per hour for the Earth.
 
✓ After the rocket engines stop firing, the rocket is basically in free-fall 
around the Earth. For travel to the Moon, another upper-stage firing puts 
the spacecraft onto the right orbit so it can reach its destination. Such a 
firing of the rockets is called a burn. During the successful Apollo Moon 
landing missions, for example, each Apollo spacecraft performed an 
orbit insertion by firing its rockets to go into orbit around the Moon. The 
Lunar Module then separated and used small retrorockets to counter 
the Moon’s lower gravity, allowing the spacecraft to land slowly and 
safely. Rockets were used at the end of the mission to lift off from the 
lunar surface and dock with the orbiting Command Module, which then 
fired its rockets to leave lunar orbit and return to Earth on a trajectory 
that would allow it to be captured by the Earth’s gravity, reduce its 
velocity by atmospheric drag, and splash down safely in the ocean. 
Figure 3-3 shows all of these stages.
 
 For a robotic spacecraft destined to travel to Mars or another planet, 
a large burn is usually conducted shortly after leaving the Earth’s 
atmosphere in order to send the spacecraft onto the correct trajectory. 
Over the many months or years it can take to travel to another planet, 
the rocket makes small course adjustments with its thrusters and some-
times uses flybys of other planets to get a gravitational boost to help it 
reach its final destination.

Start It Up: Different Sources 
of Rocket Power
To provide the thrust rockets need to lift off from Earth (we fill you in on 
thrust earlier in this chapter), rockets need propellant — and lots of it! 
Different types of propellant are used in different types of rockets, and some 
multistage rockets may use a different propellant in each stage. Although cur-
rent rockets use traditional propellants, rockets of the future may propel 
themselves using interesting and exotic methods.
Fueling the fire
 
Conventional rockets use a combination of a fuel and an oxidizer, which 
together are referred to as propellant. When large amounts of these two 
materials are mixed, the resulting chemical reaction, if properly contained, 
can provide enough thrust to send a spacecraft into orbit!

42
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
In the next couple sections, you find out how much propellant it takes to 
send a rocket into space, as well as the several types of propellant available 
for modern rockets.
The amount of propellant needed
Traveling in space requires an inordinate amount of propellant. The Space 
Shuttle, for example, uses more than 1 million pounds (450,000 kilograms) of 
solid rocket propellant in each of its solid rocket boosters, and its external 
tank contains upward of half a million gallons (1.9 million liters) of liquid 
propellant (composed of liquid hydrogen and oxygen.)
If you think that’s a lot, remember that this amount is only enough to get 
low-Earth-orbiting vehicles such as the Space Shuttle into orbit. For a space-
ship to exit the Earth’s gravitational pull, like spacecraft used in the Apollo 
Moon missions, much more propellant is necessary. Apollo’s Saturn V (which 
we describe in the earlier section “Advances in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s”) 
had three stages:
 
✓ The first stage had five engines that consumed 15 tons (13.6 metric tons) 
of propellant per second during the rocket’s two-and-a-half-minute 
burn, requiring a total of about 4.5 million pounds (2 million kilograms) 
of liquid oxygen and kerosene fuel.
 
✓ The second stage, which burned liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, 
consumed 900,000 pounds (400,000 kilograms) of propellant in less than 
seven minutes.
 
✓ The third, smaller stage used 230,000 pounds (100,000 kilograms) of 
propellant.
 
With human spaceflight, you not only have to bring enough propellant to get 
to where you’re going but you also need to save some so you can get back 
home. The huge Saturn V rocket enabled the Apollo missions to escape 
Earth’s gravitational pull and travel the 239,000 miles (385,000 kilometers) to 
the Moon over the course of a little less than four days and still return home 
safely. A future human mission to Mars, however, would require even more 
propellant both to enter and exit the Martian orbit, simply because Mars is 
both larger and farther from Earth than the Moon.
Robotic spacecraft guided into space by rockets aren’t constrained by having 
to come back home when their mission is finished. Such spacecraft still 
need to bring enough propellant with them to enter orbit around their target 
destination, however. The Cassini spacecraft, which was launched in 1997, 
traveled 2.2 billion miles (3.5 billion kilometers) and spent seven years on 
its circuitous journey from the inner solar system (the four planets closest 
to the Sun, as explained in Chapter 2) to the planet Saturn. When Cassini 
was launched, its total mass was 12,593 pounds (5,712 kilograms); of that 
mass, more than half (6,905 pounds, or 3,132 kilograms) was propellant. The 

43
 Chapter 3: Yes, It’s Rocket (And Spacecraft) Science After All
spacecraft used a little less than half of this propellant in a single, 96-minute 
burn when it arrived at Saturn in order to slow itself down enough to 
successfully enter orbit.
Types of propellant
Types of rocket propellant include the following:
 
✓ Liquid chemicals: Liquid rocket propellants (think kerosene, hydrazine, 
or liquid hydrogen as the fuel; and liquid oxygen, liquid fluorine, or 
nitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer) have greater energy density per 
volume than solid propellants, so they can carry more payload into 
space. They’re more difficult to handle and store than solid ones though, 
so a more-sophisticated system is required. Liquid rocket propellants 
can be adjusted or turned off once started. The liquid oxygen/kerosene 
combination is the most commonly used rocket propellant for lower 
stages; liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen are used in upper stages and 
on the Space Shuttle.
 
✓ Solid chemicals: Solid rocket propellants (such as ammonium perchlo-
rate as the oxidizer and hydroxyl terminated polybutadiene or polybuta-
diene acrylonitrile as the fuel) are simple, relatively cheap, and can be 
stored for long periods of time. However, the amount of thrust can’t 
be changed once ignited, and rockets using solid propellants can’t 
be turned off once started (although design variations do allow some 
flexibility). Solid-fueled rockets are typically employed for military 
applications (such as Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles); they’re also 
used as the boosters on the Space Shuttle.
 
✓ Hybrid chemicals: Hybrid-fueled rockets use a solid rocket fuel com-
bined with a liquid or gas oxidizer so as to get the benefits of both 
rocket types. Theoretically, such a rocket has the stability and cost 
advantages of a solid-fueled rocket with the thrust control of a liquid-
fueled rocket. SpaceShipOne, the first privately funded spacecraft to 
reach space, was powered by a hybrid rocket (see Chapter 22 for more 
on SpaceShipOne and other commercial space missions). However, 
hybrid rockets are still under development, primarily within the private 
space industry.
Forecasting the future of rocket propulsion
After a spacecraft has ridden into space on a rocket, it then needs a propul-
sion system to take it where it needs to go, whether that’s into Earth orbit 
or onward to a distant planet. Instead of bringing along a rocket with a 
huge tank of propellant, future missions may use more-sophisticated 
propulsion systems. The systems described in the next two sections are 
in varying stages of development and may be completely impractical for 
certain missions. With that said, they can also represent enormous savings 
in certain areas.

44
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
Ion propulsion uses xenon for a kick
One promising possibility for the future of rocket propulsion is ion propul-
sion. A traditional rocket creates thrust from the exit of exhaust at high 
velocity, which pushes the spacecraft in the opposite direction. Rather than 
rocket propellant, this new technology uses a gas called xenon. The xenon 
gas is given an electrical charge that causes it to ionize, a process in which 
electrons are removed from an atom and become charged. The ions are then 
accelerated through a series of grids and ejected from the end of the space-
craft, pushing it in the opposite direction just like a conventional rocket. 
Spacecraft such as PamAmSat 5 in 1995 and NASA’s Deep Space 1 mission in 
1999 have successfully tested the ion propulsion system.
 
One disadvantage of the ion propulsion system is that it generally has a very 
low thrust, meaning it can build up great speeds but only over a relatively long 
time. This characteristic is problematic when trying to enter orbit around a 
planet because the rocket has to stop accelerating halfway there in order to 
begin the gradual process of slowing down enough to enter orbit instead of 
relying on the long burn of a conventional rocket. Another disadvantage is 
that ion propulsion systems also require an external energy source, such as 
solar panels.
Solar sails for the modern-era Columbus
Another futuristic propulsion option is a solar sail in which a large array of 
thin, gossamer membranes is kept taut by a series of frames. These sails 
capture radiation pressure from photons given off by the Sun and use this 
tiny force over long periods of time to build up motion away from the Sun. 
Similar to sailboats on the ocean moving with energy from the wind, a space-
craft guided through space via solar sails can theoretically adjust the sail 
orientations with respect to the solar wind in order to change direction. 
Like ion propulsion, however, solar sails require a long time to accelerate or 
decelerate. They also require a very large area to carry a relatively small 
spacecraft mass.
What are the requirements for solar sail materials? They must be
 
✓ Lightweight
 
✓ Very reflective
 
✓ Able to withstand high temperatures
 
✓ Able to resist tears from small meteor impacts
 
A spacecraft with a solar sail, Cosmos 1, was launched in 2005 to test the 
technology. It was built by two private space exploration advocacy groups, 
Cosmos Studios and the Planetary Society. Unfortunately, the Russian Volna 
rocket that was to have carried Cosmos 1 into orbit failed on launch; the 
spacecraft never reached its intended orbit and was lost. The Planetary 
Society is currently raising money to build a new solar sail spacecraft and 
try again.

 Chapter 3: Yes, It’s Rocket (And Spacecraft) Science After All
Keeping the Lights On in Orbit: 
Spacecraft Power
A spacecraft needs power sources to run life-support equipment and 
onboard instruments. However, bringing fuel into space to generate power is 
a costly endeavor in terms of both finances and storage. Fuel tanks aren’t 
small objects by any stretch of the imagination, and by definition they have a 
finite storage capacity. Fortunately, other ways exist for powering spacecraft. 
We describe a couple of these options in the following sections.
Harnessing the Sun’s power
 
It wouldn’t make sense for a robotic mission to the inner solar system to try 
and bring along enough liquid or solid fuel for the entire mission. Why? 
Because the satellite has the solar system’s cheapest power source — the 
Sun — right at its disposal. Most spacecraft, except those destined for Jupiter 
or beyond, bring along large arrays of solar panels to capture the Sun’s energy 
for use as an onboard power source.
In the following sections, we describe how solar panels work and list some 
famous spacecraft that have used these panels.
How solar panels work
Solar panels consist of lightweight flat panels covered with solar photovoltaic 
cells, cells whose purpose is to capture the Sun’s energy and convert it 
into usable electricity. Solar cells are usually made from a semiconducting 
material such as silicon. They absorb the photons delivered in sunlight and 
produce electricity by separating the electrons from the rest of the atom. The 
cells are arrayed into rows, which are then connected to each other and set 
into the frame of the solar panel. Solar cells used in space may also be made 
of gallium arsenide, a compound of gallium and arsenic, because it may be a 
more-efficient semiconductor than silicon.
Most robotic missions to the inner solar system use solar panels. The power 
gained from the Sun can be used for heating and cooling, as well as for 
electric spacecraft propulsion. The solar panels on a spacecraft are similar 
to those used here on Earth, but the cells are usually packed more tightly 
together and cover as much of the panel as possible in order to maximize the 
amount of electricity produced. They’re often fanned out (to take advantage 
of the Sun’s position) into winglike shapes and typically positioned so as not 
to cast shadows onto each other. Space solar panels are designed to rotate 
so they can always face the Sun, and many use a type of tracking system to 
automatically orient themselves correctly. In the weightless environment of 
space, large, delicate solar panel arrays can be unfurled that would collapse 
under their own weight on the surface of Earth or another planet.

46
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
 
Solar panels have one distinct downside: Their usefulness on spacecraft is 
largely limited to missions in the inner solar system. In the outer solar system 
(Jupiter and beyond, as described in Chapter 2), the Sun is much fainter, and 
there isn’t enough sunlight to make solar panels an effective choice of power 
supply. (See the later section “Processing plutonium for Pluto” for details on 
the power source that spacecraft headed to the outer solar system use.)
Notable spacecraft powered by the Sun
Many famous spacecraft have used solar panels, including
 
✓ The Vanguard 1 satellite: Launched in 1958, Vanguard 1 (which orbited 
Earth) was the first spacecraft to use solar panels. It’s still in orbit today, 
but it’s no longer sending information back to Earth.
 
✓ The Mars Exploration Rovers: Spirit and Opportunity, the Mars 
Exploration Rovers, first made the Mars skyline famous in 2004 with 
their solar-array extensions. These extensions continue to provide 
plenty of power to keep the robots moving, as long as they don’t get 
too dusty! (Check out these solar panels in the color section.)
 
✓ Most satellites that orbit the Earth: From the weather satellites that 
help give you tomorrow’s forecast to the telecommunications satellites 
that help you call your sibling in another country, most Earth-orbiting 
satellites use solar panels to generate cheap, renewable energy.
 
✓ The International Space Station (ISS): The ISS relies on an array of solar 
panels that currently spans 4,000 square feet (375 square meters) and 
is 190 feet (58 meters) long. The arrays are motorized to track the 
position of the Sun so as to maximize the amount of solar radiation they 
can capture. When fully completed, the station’s solar array will cover 
nearly an acre.
 
New space projects, such as the Orion spacecraft (part of NASA’s Project 
Constellation, which you can read about in Chapter 21), will make heavy use 
of solar power. Designed to serve as an eventual replacement for the Space 
Shuttle, Orion will one day transport both cargo and people to the ISS and 
other destinations beyond the Earth, such as the Moon. It’ll use solar wings 
to provide power for its service module. These wings not only represent an 
enormous fuel savings but they also add another performance requirement to 
the spacecraft.
Processing plutonium for Pluto
Because the Sun’s energy isn’t as strong in the outer solar system, and 
because toting along a conventional power station is impractical due to 
the weight of the fuel, journeys to Jupiter and beyond rely on a radioactive 

47
 Chapter 3: Yes, It’s Rocket (And Spacecraft) Science After All
power supply: the radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG). Essentially, 
an RTG is a type of electrical power generator that uses radioactive decay as 
its energy source.
 
As radioactive materials decay, they release heat. This heat is then translated 
into usable electricity via thermocouples (temperature sensors that calculate 
the difference in temperature between conductors). In the process of measur-
ing this differential, the circuit between conductors is completed, generating 
voltage. When used in an RTG, thermocouples are situated inside the radioac-
tive fuel container and generate electricity as the fuel decays and creates heat.
Why use radioactive materials rather than safe, reliable solar power? RTGs 
make sense because they require a relatively small mass of plutonium 
to act as a fuel source, and they can provide a stable source of power over 
relatively long time periods. The three RTGs on the Cassini spacecraft, for 
example, were originally meant to provide power over an 11-year period, 
during which the power from the RTGs would drop from 276 watts to just 
216 watts. If all continues to go well and the Cassini spacecraft is awarded 
an extended mission, the RTGs would still be at about 199 watts at the end 
of 16 years.
 
RTGs are used to provide power for robotic space exploration, particularly for 
missions and probes that are so far away from the Sun that the solar panels 
NASA normally uses just don’t provide enough power. Space missions that 
have used RTGs include robotic spacecraft such as Galileo and Cassini.
A current shortage of RTGs may affect the design of upcoming missions 
to the outer solar system. Security issues at the U.S. Department of Energy 
labs that process plutonium necessitated the shutdown of the entire 
plutonium processing program, putting the agency behind schedule. NASA’s 
New Horizons spacecraft, currently en route to Pluto, didn’t receive all 
the plutonium fuel it had originally been allocated due to the shortage. Power 
constraints may also affect the upcoming Outer Planet Flagship Mission 
that’s in the planning stages for a trip to study Jupiter’s moons.
Phone Home: Communicating 
via Radio Telescopes
How do scientists on Earth talk to spacecraft far from Earth? They use a 
system of three giant radio telescopes called the Deep Space Network, 
or DSN (shown in Figure 3-4). The telescopes that make up the DSN are 
intentionally spaced around the world, with antennae in California, Spain, 
and Australia. They’re all operated by (mostly local) contractors who are 
supervised by NASA.

What are the fundamental requirements for a radio telescope?
 
✓ A transmitter to emit radio signals
 
✓ A parabola-shaped antenna to catch signals
 
✓ A receiver to process signals
The DSN allows at least one antenna to be able to track a spacecraft just 
about anywhere in the solar system at any time, and communications can be 
passed from one antenna to the next as the Earth rotates. The telescopes use 
radio signals to transmit commands to spacecraft, and they can also listen to 
the various responses from spacecraft. The DSN can listen to only one target 
at a time though, so sometimes different missions compete for use of the 
DSN at the same time, kind of like when you vie for control of the telephone 
line with the most talkative member of your family. Available DSN time also 
occasionally limits the amount of data that a spacecraft can send back.
 
Radio signals travel at the speed of light, so depending on how far away 
you are, there can be a significant time lag when calling home to Earth. 
For example, it takes about 16 minutes for a transmission to travel from 
Earth to Mars, or vice versa. This time delay makes real-time operations 
basically impossible, which is why most robotic missions are autonomous — 
programmers and scientists design routines, and the spacecraft run them on 
their own. Even the Mars Exploration Rovers must be programmed ahead of 
time with the day’s events. If they had to call Earth every time they had to 
make a decision, they’d have a 32-minute round-trip time delay that would 
significantly reduce the amount of time they had to do scientific research. 
Whenever astronauts eventually travel to Mars, they’ll be subject to the same 
32-minute time delay in sending and receiving messages to and from Earth, 
so they’ll also need to act autonomously most of the time.

49
 Chapter 3: Yes, It’s Rocket (And Spacecraft) Science After All
The technological demands on the DSN are significant.
 
✓ Not only must it be carefully scheduled to accommodate the ever-
growing number of NASA space missions but it must also continue to 
support old missions as well.
 
✓ Detecting a signal from a spacecraft hundreds of millions of miles away 
is incredibly difficult. Due to onboard power constraints, spacecraft 
usually send out very low-power signals (about the same wattage as a 
refrigerator light bulb). The signal is focused into a very tight beam and 
is sent directly to Earth, but as it travels over millions or hundreds of 
millions of miles, it spreads out and becomes weaker. By the time the 
antennae of the DSN are able to detect the signal, it may be as weak as a 
billionth of a billionth of a watt.
 
✓ The DSN antennae are designed to have a very narrow beam, so they 
must be pointed directly at a spacecraft’s position to send or receive 
messages. The signal is captured by the antenna or antennae, amplified, 
and eventually reconstructed into the latest images of Saturn’s satellites 
or the composition of a Martian rock.

The Life and Times of an Astronaut
In This Chapter

▶ Getting the scoop on astronaut job descriptions
▶ Working and living in space
M
any children dream of becoming astronauts, and for most of them, 
this challenging career path remains but a dream. That doesn’t make 
the thought of traveling in space any less exciting though. Many aspiring 
astronauts apply, but few are chosen for training — and trust us, the elite 
few who are selected have their work cut out for them! Astronaut training 
involves extensive academic, physical, and survival-related work, as well as 
time in simulators and experience in a mock-weightless environment. After 
training, commanders, pilots, and various specialists live and work in space. 
You find out all the exciting details in this chapter.
 
Today’s astronauts follow in the footsteps of greatness. From the first 
American to take flight to the catastrophic deaths of the Challenger and 
Columbia crews, all astronauts have made great sacrifices (both personal 
and professional) to follow their dreams. The job for tomorrow’s astronauts 
promises to be no less thrilling, difficult, or history-making.
Preparing to Become an Astronaut
One of the most-popular questions asked of astronaut training programs 
worldwide is this: What makes a good astronaut? Generally, a solid candidate 
is one who’s proficient in her field and in good physical condition. She’s also 
able to work as part of a team and can communicate easily with different 
types of people. Being able to hold up well under adverse conditions and 
possessing strong leadership abilities are also valued qualities.

52
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
Educational and physical requirements
Astronauts must hold at least a bachelor’s degree in physical science, mathe-
matics, biological science, or engineering from an accredited college or 
university. They must also have at least three years of work experience after 
college (the good news is advanced degrees count toward this required work 
experience). Picking a specialty in a space-related area of science can’t hurt 
either; NASA encourages potential astronaut candidates to focus on any area 
in which they can excel.
 
If you think you want to become a United States astronaut, the time to start 
acting on that desire is while you’re in school. Taking as many high school 
chemistry, physics, and other science classes as you can will help you with 
the preparations for more-advanced science classes later on.
Both civilians and military personnel can become astronauts. Pilot training is 
beneficial for many of the positions on a Space Shuttle crew and is an abso-
lute necessity for securing a piloting job. (We describe a pilot’s job in more 
detail later in this chapter.)
In addition to the various educational and skill-related requirements, astro-
naut candidates also have to be physically able to do their jobs. They must 
meet the following distinct physical requirements, as well as other medical 
requirements:
 
✓ Eyesight: All astronauts have eyesight that’s correctable to 20/20 with 
the aid of glasses or contact lenses. As of 2007, laser eye surgeries have 
been accepted for vision correction as well.
 
✓ Blood pressure: The maximum blood pressure an astronaut can have is 
140/90.
 
✓ Height: Don’t apply if you’re shorter than 62 inches (1.57 meters) or 
taller than 75 inches (1.93 meters).
 
You may be interested to know that age isn’t a restricting factor. The average 
age of astronaut candidates is currently 34.
United States citizenship is most definitely a requirement to be a NASA 
astronaut, though payload specialists (which we cover later in this chapter) 
may be citizens of other countries, depending on their qualifications.
 
Check out astronauts.nasa.gov for more info about the requirements to 
become a U.S. astronaut.
Training programs
Ultimately, applying to NASA’s Astronaut Candidate Program is the step 
that leads toward the start of a two-year training period that can result in 

53
 Chapter 4: The Life and Times of an Astronaut
becoming a U.S. astronaut. The selection process is extremely competitive: 
Typically, more than 4,000 people apply every two years, and only about 20 
are accepted into the training program, with just 10 to 15 becoming qualified 
astronauts.
 
The training received by both astronaut candidates and those people 
accepted into the astronaut program falls into two main categories: academic 
and physical. After completing the two-year training period, a lucky few of 
the candidates are selected to join the astronaut program. These folks con-
tinue with the same basic academic and physical training they engaged in 
as candidates — it just becomes more specialized. After being chosen for a 
specific mission, astronauts typically receive ten months of training (or more!) 
before taking flight.
Academic training for astronauts
Although training to become an astronaut may seem like the most fun 
job ever, it’s still hard work. The academic side of the training involves 
taking classes in rocket and shuttle science, in addition to mathematics, 
meteorology, oceanography, physics, and other sciences.
Additional academic training for astronauts can consist of
 
✓ Foreign language courses (particularly Russian)
 
✓ Required reading
 
✓ Space Shuttle training (everything from the propulsion systems to the 
power and communications systems)
 
✓ Tests
 
✓ Trainer plane acclimation
 
✓ Workbooks
Physical training for astronauts
The physical training for astronauts can be quite arduous and covers a range 
of skills that must be acquired in order to be certified for space travel. 
Astronauts are trained to expect the worst, so their physical training covers 
a lot of ground, as you can see from this list:
 
✓ Aviation physiology
 
✓ Ejector seat training
 
✓ Flight training
 
✓ “Ground School” plane navigation
 
✓ Land navigation
 
✓ Land survival

54
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
 
✓ Lunar and Martian gravity simulation
 
✓ Parachuting
 
✓ Reduced-gravity simulation
 
✓ Water survival
 
✓ Wearing an advanced crew escape suit (ACES)
Replicating the weightless environment of space travel here on Earth is 
rather difficult. Astronauts can train in a specially equipped airplane, 
affectionately nicknamed the Vomit Comet, that flies through a series of dives 
and steep climbs on a parabolic trajectory (a smooth curve that turns over at 
the top). During the fast dives, astronauts inside the plane experience short 
periods of weightlessness — and we mean short! These weightless periods 
last for less than 30 seconds, which doesn’t give the astronauts time to do 
much training.
Fortunately there’s also the underwater option. NASA’s Neutral Buoyancy 
Lab (shown in Figure 4-1 and part of the astronaut training facility at Johnson 
Space Center in Houston, Texas) is the world’s largest swimming pool. 
Technicians place mockups of astronaut mission targets, such as the 
International Space Station, underwater. Wearing specially designed space-
suits that function much like the real thing, astronauts train for spacewalks 
that may include space station construction, satellite deployment, or repair 
missions. Training underwater is the closest that astronauts can come on 
Earth to the actual space environment, and during a spacewalk (which is an 
extravehicular activity [EVA] performed in space) where every minute counts, 
astronauts appreciate the endless underwater drills they endured during 
their training.

International programs
 
The U.S. is, of course, not the only country to produce astronauts. The 
Chinese have taikonauts, and the Russians have cosmonauts. Yet no matter 
the country of origin or the name they’re called, all astronauts are trained to 
high standards to ensure both their safety and the success of their missions. 
The training specifics tend to differ from country to country though. Russian 
cosmonauts, for example, train using Russian spacecraft (such as the 
Soyuz) rather than the American spacecraft that U.S. astronauts study. Each 
country’s astronauts also train for familiarity with their own spacesuits and 
vehicles.
The Russian cosmonaut program has some additional core differences from 
the U.S. astronaut program. Russian cosmonauts receive extra training in the 
English language and space-specific terminology. Also, although any 
American civilian with the proper scientific background can apply to be an 
astronaut, most Russian cosmonauts are chosen from either the Russian Air 
Force, IMBP (the State Research Center of The Russian Federation), or RSC 
Energia (the S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation).
In China, the government has focused on training experienced Air Force 
pilots for its budding taikonaut program. The candidates selected for China’s 
first batch of taikonauts are all required to have at least 1,000 hours of 
flying time, as well as a master’s degree (at minimum) in a technical field 
such as physics, engineering, or biology. Because no cooperative agreement 
currently exists between the Chinese space program and the Russian or 
American programs, no language training is required for taikonauts. (You 
can read more about China’s space program in Chapter 22.)
Introducing the Crew of a Space Mission
United States astronauts can fill one of several positions aboard a spacecraft: 
pilot, commander, payload specialist, mission specialist, or education 
specialist. Each position usually requires specific training, because being 
an astronaut is just like any other specialized job in that there’s more than 
one type of astronaut. Someone who was an expert in flying a four-seater 
airplane, for example, wouldn’t one day decide to fly a commercial jetliner 
with 500 seats. He’d need specific training for takeoff, landing, maneuvering, 
and the host of other skills required to safely fly a plane. Astronauts have 
similar basic training, but their particular skill sets qualify them for certain 
positions.

56
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
Commanders and pilots are at the wheel
The commander is the person responsible for the overall safety and success 
of the mission, as well as for the space vehicles themselves. The pilot works 
with the commander to operate the spacecraft, deploy satellites, and perform 
other major functional tasks while in space.
A commander must possess an advanced degree in engineering, physics, 
mathematics, or a relevant scientific field and have experience working in 
that field. Physically, pilots need to be able to fit into their seats comfortably. 
Consequently they have to be between 62 inches (1.57 meters) and 75 inches 
(1.93 meters) tall. Most pilot astronauts have military flying experience or, if 
not, plenty of flight hours logged. Regardless of their civilian or military 
status, they must possess a pilot’s license because they’re the ones in the 
driver’s seat.
Mission and education specialists 
bring additional expertise
The mission specialist is responsible for ensuring the success of the specific 
mission to which he’s assigned. Mission specialists can lead spacewalks, run 
experiments in space, operate all the equipment for a mission, and otherwise 
assist with the functioning of a mission. They must have at least a bachelor’s 
degree in a math- or science-related field, as well as professional experience 
in that field. They also need to meet the same height requirements as other 
types of astronauts.
Some missions have a mission specialist-educator (MSE) in addition to a 
mission specialist. This person performs a similar function as the mission 
specialist, but he also has other educational duties. MSEs have a degree in 
teaching and must have worked as teachers for several years. (For more 
info on the new Educator Astronaut Program, which all MSEs must complete, 
flip to Chapter 5.)
Payload specialists meet 
specific technical needs
Payload specialists are the technical experts for the particular payload on a 
mission (the payload is the cargo that a spacecraft carries into space; in this 
context, “payload” usually refers to equipment and scientific experiments). 
They may be specially trained in satellites, for example, and are frequently 
responsible for the scientific components of a mission. Most payload 

57
 Chapter 4: The Life and Times of an Astronaut
specialists are selected for a particular mission, and that’s often their only 
mission in space. Mission specialists and pilots, on the other hand, often 
qualify for multiple flights.
Payload specialists usually aren’t NASA astronauts; they may be physicians, 
researchers, or technicians who are experts in using a particular piece of 
equipment, for example. Payload specialists don’t need to meet the U.S. 
citizen requirement. Many payload specialists are astronauts from other 
countries, particularly Russia. All payload specialists have to receive NASA 
approval, meet the same general fitness and physical requirements as other 
astronauts (we describe these requirements earlier in this chapter), and go 
through training for space travel.
Commercial payload specialists were common in the early days of the Space 
Shuttle program, but they have become less common. Commercial compa-
nies have reduced the use of the Shuttle to launch commercial payloads due 
to increases in cost, delays, and perceived risk following the Challenger 
explosion in 1986 (see Chapter 5). After this loss, astronaut crews were 
composed primarily of career astronauts, and experiments were operated by 
mission specialists rather than payload specialists.
Living and Working in Space
Just like the rest of us back here on the ground, astronauts need to take care 
of the basics of living. However, activities such as eating, drinking, bathing, 
and exercising become a lot more difficult when they’re performed in the 
microgravity of space! Check out the adaptations that astronauts have to 
make to their daily routines in the following sections.
Eating and drinking
Everyone needs to eat, including astronauts. The foods they eat are packed 
with nutrients. They’re also relatively dense so they can’t float away (that 
means no salt or sugar — bummer), crumble (which can lead to clogged 
instruments — never a good thing), or take up too much space. Space food 
has come a long way from what the early Mercury astronauts had to endure 
in the 1960s; most of their meals consisted of cubed food, and semiliquids 
sucked from toothpaste-like tubes. Later innovations led to better packaging, 
eliminating the unpopular squeeze tubes; hot water for rehydrating food; and 
foods that can be eaten from bowls by using utensils.

58
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
The galleys in today’s Space Shuttles have equipment for dispensing water 
and heating food but not for storing cold foods, meaning all food must be 
either fresh, dehydrated, irradiated, or thermostabilized (such as those shelf-
stable foil packages) in order to travel well. Soups and beverages are drunk 
through straws or served in squeeze bottles. More solid meals can be eaten 
with utensils, which are generally held down to the astronauts’ meal trays 
with the aid of magnets and straps. Without the straps, an astronaut’s lunch 
would float away before she got to her second bite! (You can see modern 
astronaut food in Figure 4-2.)
Meat, breads, cheeses, fruits, vegetables, nuts, desserts, and drinks are all 
common staples aboard a spacecraft. Astronauts get to pick from a range of 
meals, and the amount of food each astronaut is allocated is calculated 
according to his or her body weight and type. Due to the international nature 
of space travel, foods that appeal to people from different countries are now 
offered. And what about that gift-shop staple, dehydrated “Astronaut Ice 
Cream”? This product was actually developed for NASA and flew on Apollo 7, 
but it proved unpopular with the crew and was discontinued. It’s much 
more popular on the ground than in space! You can find out the details of 
astronaut meals in the nearby sidebar, “A sample menu of astronaut food.”
A sample menu of astronaut food
The food astronauts eat is designed to provide 
energy, meet nutritional needs, and keep the 
astronauts happy. Meeting all of these goals 
required some new engineering of previous 
space foods, but the current menu offers more 
variety than in years past. It also allows the 
astronauts to eat more of the foods they’re 
familiar with while they’re away from home.
Common astronaut beverages:
 ✓ Coffee (sweetened or unsweetened)
 ✓ Tea (sweetened or unsweetened, with or 
without lemon)
 ✓ Lemonade
 ✓ Fruit juices and punch
 ✓ Apple cider
Typical astronaut breakfast:
 ✓ Cereal
 ✓ Roll
 ✓ Fruit
 ✓ Breakfast drink
 ✓ Coffee or tea
Typical astronaut lunch:
 ✓ Peanut butter and jelly burrito
 ✓ Chicken with salsa
 ✓ Macaroni and cheese
 ✓ Buttered rice
 ✓ Fruit juice
Typical astronaut dinner:
 ✓ Shrimp cocktail
 ✓ Steak or chicken
 ✓ Fruit cocktail
 ✓ Fruit drink
 ✓ Tea with sugar or lemon

Sleeping soundly
When it’s time for sleep, astronauts have the option of crawling into strapped-
down sleeping bags, climbing into the commander or pilot seats, or making 
use of several bunk beds. Because astronauts are weightless in gravity-free 
space, they must be attached to some part of the spacecraft before settling 
down for the night. Additionally, many astronauts wear sleep masks — 
you probably would too if the Sun rose every 90 minutes right outside your 
window!
Astronauts are usually scheduled for eight hours of sleep at the end of each 
day. The crews of the early capsule-based Gemini and Apollo missions 
attempted staggered sleep schedules, but the crowded quarters made this 
setup difficult. Nowadays, all astronauts on the Space Shuttle typically sleep 
and wake at the same time. (Although on some missions, the crew may be 
divided into two teams with staggered sleep and work periods to get more 
done.) NASA’s Mission Control Center monitors the Space Shuttle at all times 
and can immediately alert the crew to any problems that arise while they’re 
asleep.
Staying clean
Hot shower while aboard a Space Shuttle? Not happening. Astronauts on a 
spacecraft take sponge baths while in orbit (unless of course they’re lucky 
enough to be aboard the International Space Station — it has a shower!). 
Believe it or not, some of that water actually comes from the astronauts’ 
breath. Most living creatures exhale and sweat, both of which contribute to 
onboard humidity. Special equipment helps convert that extra moisture in 

60
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
the air back into water. Nevertheless, astronauts do wash their hair (with 
rinseless shampoo), brush their teeth, shave, and otherwise keep themselves 
clean using the tools in their personal hygiene kits.
Space shuttles have toilets, but they don’t use water. Instead, these space 
commodes employ a fan and vacuum system to suck waste and urine into the 
toilet. And yes, astronauts must strap themselves down before using the 
facilities because a strong seal between the astronaut and the toilet keeps the 
waste from floating up into the cabin.
 
Unlike most other things on a spacecraft, waste isn’t recycled; it’s stored and 
disposed. During the early days of the space program, liquid waste was vented 
into space. In fact, one Apollo-era astronaut reportedly quipped that the most 
beautiful sight he saw in space was a urine dump at sunset. Because water is 
heavy and expensive to bring into space, NASA is currently working on a new 
system to completely recycle all water collected from astronauts, including 
urine, into clean drinking water.
Exercising in orbit
Exercise is as important in space as it is on Earth — perhaps even more 
so because living in microgravity reduces both bone and muscle strength. 
Following are the many different ways the human body changes while in 
space:
 
✓ Muscles atrophy.
 
✓ Bone mass decreases.
 
✓ Calcium levels increase.
 
✓ The face gets puffier.
 
✓ Heart rate, red blood cell counts, and blood plasma levels all decrease.
 
✓ The spine straightens and expands.
 
✓ The immune system becomes compromised, leading to an increased risk 
of infection.
Astronauts can also experience these less-than-desirable conditions:
 
✓ Claustrophobia
 
✓ Clogged noses and sinuses (“space sniffles”)
 
✓ Sleep deprivation and disruption of circadian rhythm

61
 Chapter 4: The Life and Times of an Astronaut
 
✓ Space Adaptation Syndrome (sometimes called “space motion sickness” 
or just “space sickness;” it results from the body’s adaptation to micro-
gravity and, in most cases, lasts for the first few days of an astronaut’s 
journey)
 
✓ Temporary disorientation and vertigo
The International Space Station has a treadmill and an exercise bicycle, but 
the astronauts there still have to strap themselves to the equipment before 
using it. Astronauts may exercise for as much as three to four hours per day!
Dressing well
During takeoff and landing, astronauts wear Launch and Entry Suits that can 
maintain air pressure for the astronauts in case the spacecraft has a leak. The 
suits are also insulated, which can help keep astronauts warm if they need 
to swim in cold ocean water during an emergency escape. At other times in 
space, astronauts can wear more-comfortable clothing, much like what they 
can wear here on Earth. Typical clothing choices include one-piece coveralls, 
shorts, and either a T-shirt or a rugby shirt in crew colors.
 
Essential components of a spacesuit include
 
✓ Stable pressurization
 
✓ Insulation and temperature regulation systems
 
✓ An oxygen supply
 
✓ Hydration equipment
 
✓ A communications carrier system
 
✓ Micrometeroid protection
 
✓ Flame-retardant material
 
✓ Flexible joints
 
✓ Tether points to the spacecraft
 
✓ Ultraviolet radiation shielding
 
✓ Gas and liquid expulsion systems
 
✓ A waste collection system
 
✓ Arm, helmet, glove, and torso assemblies

Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
Taking spacewalks and doing other work
When work needs to be done outside of the spacecraft or space station, a 
spacewalk may be in order (head to the color section of this book to see 
an image of a spacewalk). Spacewalks, or extravehicular activities (EVAs) 
performed in space, involve a battery-powered Extravehicular Mobility Unit 
(EMU). Spacewalks can be tethered, meaning the astronaut is connected to 
the spacecraft by an oxygen-carrying “umbilical cord,” or untethered, meaning 
the astronaut must have some means of propulsion that can return her safely 
to the spacecraft after the task at hand is completed.
 
Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov executed the first spacewalk in the history 
of space travel in 1965, when he spent ten minutes outside the airlock of the 
Voskhod 2 spacecraft (see Chapter 7 for details).
Onboard a spacecraft, astronauts have a full schedule of activities that 
can involve running scientific experiments, troubleshooting or fixing malfunc-
tioning systems, or performing scheduled maintenance activities to keep 
their spacecraft in top working condition.
Astronauts train for months or years before a mission, and because time in 
space is incredibly valuable (and pricey!), every minute counts. After early 
missions during which astronauts felt they were completely overscheduled 
and rebelled against instructions from Mission Control, NASA has realized 
that astronauts, like everyone else, need some downtime built into their 
schedules to read, talk to friends and relatives back on Earth, or just stare 
out the window. With an out-of-this-world view, no astronaut has ever com-
plained about that option!

Redstone 4, almost ended in tragedy when the capsule began to sink 
following its landing in the ocean. Astronaut Virgil “Gus” Grissom 
narrowly escaped.

Challenger explosion in 1986, which killed all seven astronauts onboard. 
The Columbia explosion in 2003, which also killed the entire crew,

We provide greater detail about these tragedies in this chapter. Although 
space exploration certainly has its risks, as evidenced by the brave men and 
women who risked or gave their lives in these incidents, each failure also

Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
helped make future flights — and future generations of space explorers — 
safer because safety enhancements were made from the many lessons 
learned.
Mercury-Redstone 4 (1961): 
A Flooded Capsule
In the early days of the American space program, NASA was just figuring out 
how to send astronauts to the edge of space on suborbital flights. These 
flights didn’t orbit the Earth. Instead, they sampled the conditions of space 
for a few minutes before returning to the ground. The flight tests in this 
series were designed to further NASA’s research into how humans would 
react and handle situations during human spaceflights; rocket and flight 
research, although obviously important, were secondary to this goal of 
furthering the budding idea of putting humans in space.
NASA’s Mercury-Redstone 4 (M-R4) mission in 1961 was the second manned 
U.S. suborbital flight (and the fourth mission in this series of tests). Astronaut 
Virgil “Gus” Grissom piloted M-R4 in a Mercury capsule, named Liberty 
Bell 7, atop a Redstone rocket. This test flight differed from its predecessor, 
Mercury-Redstone 3 (the flight that made Alan Shepard the first American in 
space; see Chapter 7 for details), in two major ways:
 
✓ Liberty Bell 7 had an additional viewing window, which was put in at the 
request of the Mercury astronauts. The side windows in the previous 
Mercury spacecraft didn’t allow for an extensive viewing area, and the 
new window increased the astronauts’ field of view to more than 30 
degrees in both directions.
 
✓ Liberty Bell 7 also had an explosively actuated side hatch. What does 
“explosively actuated” mean, you ask? Well, the Mercury-Redstone 3 
spacecraft had a mechanical hatch that was quite heavy (69 pounds, 
or 31 kilograms, to be exact) and had to be operated manually by the 
astronaut inside. The new hatch design in Liberty Bell 7 weighed just 
23 pounds and operated “explosively.” Literally. When the astronaut was 
ready to emerge and hit a trigger switch, charges would detonate and 
break the titanium bolts holding the hatch onto the spacecraft. The 
hatch would then fly open without the astronaut having to lift it off.
 
Other changes from the Mercury-Redstone 3 capsule included new rate 
stabilization controls, a change in how the rockets were fired, a redesign of 
the instrument panel, and improvements to the pilot seat.

65
 Chapter 5: Tragedies in Space
Grissom’s narrow escape
The actual M-R4 mission went off without a hitch, starting with its launch 
on July 21, 1961. (Technically the mission was supposed to launch two 
days earlier, but that plan was postponed due to bad weather.) Liftoff was 
successful, and the spacecraft was aloft for 15 minutes and 37 seconds.
The problem occurred during landing. After splashing down in the ocean, the 
Mercury capsule was still watertight, and Grissom logged the cockpit data 
before requesting a pickup from the waiting recovery helicopters. According 
to Grissom, it was then that the newly designed hatch activated prematurely, 
causing the hatch door to fly open and water to start pouring into the 
capsule. Within minutes, the capsule flooded with water. Grissom narrowly 
averted death by climbing out of the Liberty Bell 7 and struggling in the ocean 
for a few minutes while his flight suit filled with water from an open neck seal. 
Fortunately, Grissom was quickly picked up by a recovery helicopter.
Though it tried, the recovery team wasn’t able to prevent the Liberty Bell 7 
from sinking. The spacecraft wasn’t seen again until 1999 when a commercial 
crew of divers located it 300 nautical miles (550 kilometers) off the coast of 
Florida, under 15,000 feet (4.5 kilometers) of water. Although the recovery 
didn’t help solve the question of why the hatch blew too early, it did provide 
a valuable historical record: The capsule is currently on display in a Kansas 
museum.
The hatch release changes that 
followed Liberty Bell 7
Following the loss of the Liberty Bell 7, a number of changes were made to 
future Mercury capsules. Initial reports cast suspicion that Grissom some-
how opened his hatch prematurely, but later analysis suggested that the

external release lanyard could’ve come loose, considering it was held on by a 
single screw aboard the spacecraft. On future Mercury flights, the release 
was attached more securely.
 
Another change proved more tragic. Because Liberty Bell 7 had shown that an 
explosive-release hatch had the potential to release prematurely, the design-
ers of the Apollo spacecraft didn’t initially include a quick-release door in that 
spacecraft. Unfortunately, that decision led to the demise of the three Apollo 1 
astronauts, as we explain in the next section.
Apollo 1 (1967): A Lethal Fire
Originally dubbed the AS-204 mission, the 1967 Apollo 1 mission would’ve 
been the first launch of NASA’s new Apollo spacecraft, paving the way for an 
eventual Moon landing. A Saturn 1B rocket would’ve launched the Command 
Module and the following three astronauts into orbit:
 
✓ Lieutenant Colonel Virgil “Gus” Grissom
 
✓ Lieutenant Colonel Edward White
 
✓ Lieutenant Commander Roger Chaffee
On January 27, 1967 — one month before the scheduled launch date — all 
three men were onboard the spacecraft for a test run on the launchpad when 
events took a horrible turn.
Death on the ground
The simulation test was what’s known as a plugs-out test, or a test designed 
to see whether a spacecraft can be operated completely on internal power 
after being disconnected from external cables and umbilical tubes. After 
the spacecraft’s cabin was sealed, it filled with pressurized oxygen, and 
communications problems caused the launch simulation to be delayed 
several times. At some point during this lull, a spark led to fire erupting in 
the cockpit.
The overpressurized Command Module turned into a furnace as the pure-
oxygen atmosphere fanned the flames. In a matter of seconds, the capsule 
ruptured from the pressure. It took outside engineers five minutes to get the 
spacecraft’s hatch open, during which time the astronauts were trapped 
inside the cabin. All three men died in the fire, which ravaged the interior of 
the capsule (see Figure 5-1).

A tangle of flaws that contributed
Although the actual source of the fire wasn’t isolated in the reports and 
investigations that followed the fatal test run, several potential causes may 
have led to the destruction of the Command Module:
 
✓ The atmosphere in the module consisted of 100-percent oxygen at 
higher than normal pressure, which basically allowed almost anything 
to burn — and burn quickly at high temperatures. NASA officials chose 
to use this atmosphere rather than a more Earth-like mixture of oxygen 
and nitrogen to prevent decompression sickness as pressure in flight 
was reduced. (Pure-oxygen atmospheres had been used safely on earlier 
Mercury and Gemini spacecraft, giving them no reason to think such an 
atmosphere wouldn’t work for the new Apollo spacecraft.)
 
✓ Flammable materials were present in several areas of the cockpit. 
With the high pressure of oxygen in the cabin, even materials like the 
aluminum instrument panels and the cabin’s Velcro lining were highly 
flammable.
 
✓ The spacesuits worn by the first Apollo astronauts contained nylon, 
which may have created static electricity when rubbed against the seats. 
The suits also melted in the fire.
 
 Nylon, a synthetic fiber made from coal, air, and water, will certainly 
melt in a high-temperature, oxygen-fanned inferno. It’s used frequently 
in clothing, carpets, and rope, and it found early military applications in 
parachutes and tires. The melting point of nylon is about 509 degrees 

68
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
Fahrenheit, or 265 degrees Celsius; a typical nonchemical fire, such as 
that found in a candle flame, burns between 1,472 and 1,832 degrees 
Fahrenheit (or 800 and 1,400 degrees Celsius). Clearly nylon wouldn’t 
have been able to withstand the fire the Apollo 1 astronauts faced.
 
✓ The hatch in the Command Module opened inward rather than outward. 
The Apollo 1 astronauts had requested the design be changed so 
that the hatch would open outward, but NASA kept the inward design 
(thinking that resulted, ironically, from Grissom’s Mercury-Redstone 4 
disaster in which the explosive hatch opened prematurely; we cover 
that mission earlier in this chapter). However, during the fire, the 
pressure inside the cabin was too great for the astronauts to be able to 
open the inward-swinging door.
 
✓ A myriad of other electrical, plumbing, and wiring flaws may also have 
played a role, according to the findings of a NASA review panel.
The official cause of death for the astronauts was listed as smoke inhalation. 
The men had also suffered burns over much of their bodies, as evidenced 
by Grissom’s nearly completely melted spacesuit. After this tragedy, NASA 
renamed the AS-204 mission Apollo 1 in honor of the deceased astronauts.
Spacecraft design changes 
made in the aftermath
 
In the aftermath of the fire, several design changes were made to Project 
Apollo before it was allowed to continue:
 
✓ The spacecraft’s hatch was redesigned to open outward; the explosive 
actuation was added back in; and a requirement that the hatch must be 
able to open in less than ten seconds was introduced.
 
✓ All flammable materials were exchanged for ones that could extinguish 
flames rather than fuel them, and the nylon spacesuits were replaced 
with suits made from a nonflammable fabric.
 
✓ Takeoff cabin atmosphere was redesigned to be more like that on 
Earth at sea level (60 percent oxygen and 40 percent nitrogen), with 
more-gradual pressure changes.
 
✓ All wires and tubes were coated with a fire-retardant insulation, and all 
known wiring problems (more than 1,000 in all) were fixed.

 Chapter 5: Tragedies in Space
Soyuz 1 (1967) and Soyuz 11 (1971): 
Failures on Landing and in Orbit
The United States wasn’t alone in experiencing early tragedies in its space 
program. The Soviet Union’s space program experienced them too, but that 
program’s administrators were generally much more secretive than NASA 
officials. Early tragedies, such as the loss of cosmonaut Valentin Bondarenko 
due to a 1961 fire in a simulator on the ground, were concealed from the 
masses. Tragedies that took place in the sky, however, quickly became public 
knowledge. These disasters included the loss of one cosmonaut upon landing 
on Soyuz 1 in 1967 and the loss of three others in orbit on Soyuz 11 in 1971.
Soyuz 1
One of the first major tragedies of the Soviet Union’s (now Russia’s) space 
program occurred aboard the Soyuz 1. In the 1960s, this new spacecraft 
was designed to be the flagship vehicle of the Soviet Union’s space program. 
Not only that but it was also intended to pave the way for human flights 
to the Moon. Soyuz 1 carried one cosmonaut, Colonel Vladimir Komarov, 
and it was scheduled to be part of a manual docking experiment that was 
to be followed the next day by another Soyuz crew with three additional 
cosmonauts. Two of these men would’ve performed a spacewalk, otherwise 
known as an extravehicular activity (EVA) performed in space, to the Soyuz 1.
The launch proceeded according to plan on April 23, 1967, but almost imme-
diately afterward, problems began. A solar panel failed to deploy correctly, 
causing a power shortage for the Soyuz 1 and wrapping itself around the

spacecraft. After several orbits, it became clear that the Soyuz 1’s stabiliza-
tion system wasn’t functioning. The second Soyuz crew initially began 
preparing to join Komarov in space and help fix the Soyuz 1, but weather 
conditions at the launch site, Baikonur, and news of more-severe problems 
aboard the Soyuz 1 halted those plans.
Due to Soyuz 1’s problems, the spacecraft was recalled for an early return to 
Earth. Although Komarov’s control over the spacecraft was limited, he did 
manage to fire the retrorockets and deorbit more or less on schedule. 
Komarov deployed his drogue chute to slow the spacecraft’s speed to below 
the speed of sound, but after that, the main parachute didn’t deploy due to a 
mechanical sensor failure. The backup parachute did deploy but got tangled 
up with the drogue chute, which hadn’t detached from the spacecraft like 
it was supposed to. Soyuz 1 came crashing to the Earth at around 90 miles 
(145 kilometers) per hour and exploded on impact. Komarov was found 
dead inside.
 
Parachute problems can be extremely dangerous, because lives may depend 
on their proper functioning. Spacecraft absolutely count on their parachutes 
being in good working order because often when rockets descend, they 
deploy parachutes to slow down as they approach Earth. Different types of 
parachutes can be used to slow a spacecraft in stages. For example, drogue 
parachutes are longer and thinner than the type of parachute used for 
humans; they’re designed for deployment from very fast-moving objects and 
are a typical part of a spacecraft’s equipment list.
 
Of unfortunate significance is the fact that the Soyuz 1 mission represented 
the first fatality during a spaceflight. The Soyuz 1 spacecraft was rushed to 
launch to meet a political deadline and therefore hadn’t been properly tested 
or checked. The Soyuz 1 crash set the Soviet space program back by about 
18 months while engineering and design flaws (including those regarding the 
parachutes) were addressed, though politics and competition in the Space 
Race kept the Soviets pushing forward.

Fast facts about Soyuz 11
Following are the basic facts about the Soyuz 11 
mission:
 ✓ Launch date and site: June 6, 1971; Baikonur 
Cosmodrome, USSR
 ✓ Spacecraft name and mass at launch: 
Soyuz 11; 14,970 lb (6,790 kg)
 ✓ Launch vehicle: Soyuz rocket

 ✓ Number of Earth orbits: 383

Soyuz 11
Soyuz 11 is celebrated as the first time a crew successfully docked with and 
visited a space station, namely Salyut 1, the first space station (see Chapter 
12 for more info on Salyut 1). The crew consisted of three cosmonauts: 
Commander Georgi Dobrovolski, Flight Engineer Vladislav Volkov, and Test 
Engineer Viktor Patsayev. They docked with Salyut 1 on June 7, 1971, a day 
after launch, and remained on the space station for 22 days.
The cosmonauts encountered a surprise when they first entered Salyut 1: The 
air was smoky and the ventilation system was in need of serious repairs. 
The crew replaced parts and then retreated back to their Soyuz capsule 
until the space station air was more breathable. After making history as the 
longest-lasting crew to live in space at that time, the men headed back home 
and landed on Earth on June 30.
However, a grisly site awaited the engineers who opened the Soyuz 11 
capsule — all three cosmonauts were dead. The ensuing investigation 
showed that the men had asphyxiated due to an opened breathing ventilation 
valve, one that came loose during reentry when the explosive bolts 
connecting the descent and service modules fired at the wrong times. Air 
pressure inside the cabin plummeted to zero until the capsule broke through 
the Earth’s atmosphere. One of the cosmonauts’ sensors showed that he 
perished within about 40 seconds of the air pressure in the cabin dropping.
 
Even had the men known what was wrong, they would’ve been unable to 
reconnect the loose valve because it was positioned behind their seats. 
Ground crews attempted resuscitation on landing, but they were too late to 
do any good.

72
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
 
As a result of this tragedy — the only time people have died while actually 
in space, beyond the atmosphere — the Soyuz capsule was redesigned to 
carry just two cosmonauts. With the space saved by eliminating the third 
cosmonaut, those onboard could wear pressure suits for the launch and 
landing periods. The three crew members of Soyuz 11 didn’t wear spacesuits, 
because there wasn’t enough room for them.
Apollo 13 (1970): A Successful Failure
One of the most-sensational accidents in space, which was brought to new 
prominence thanks to the self-titled 1995 movie, the Apollo 13 mission to the 
Moon would’ve been the third such crewed mission. The crew consisted of 
Commander James Lovell, Lunar Module Pilot Fred Haise, and Command 
Module Pilot Jack Swigert. The astronauts intended to explore part of the 
Moon known as the Fra Mauro Formation, but they never got the chance. The 
launch proceeded relatively uneventfully, but on April 14, 1970 — just two 
days following the launch — disaster struck.
“Houston, we’ve had a problem”
Apollo 13 contained two tanks of liquid oxygen that were used for the astro-
nauts to breathe, as well as for running the spacecraft’s power-generating 
fuel cells. A thermostat lay inside each tank, and it (plus a heater) kept 
the oxygen at the correct temperature. Crew members stirred these tanks 
regularly in order to keep the oxygen properly mixed. (The contents of the 
tanks had a tendency to settle out into layers, so periodic stirrings helped 
ensure accurate tank readings. And no, the astronauts didn’t go out there 
with a big spoon — the stirring process was automated.)
When ground controllers requested a stirring of the tanks, the astronauts 
turned on the tank fans. However, after one such stirring about two days into 
the mission, the Number 2 oxygen tank unexpectedly sparked and exploded. 
In the process, the other oxygen tank and the Service Module itself were 
damaged; in fact, one entire side panel of the module was ejected in the 
explosion. The astronauts reported the explosion back to Mission Control, at 
Johnson Space Center in Texas, with the famously understated line, 
“Houston, we’ve had a problem.”
Following the explosion, the Service Module became unusable due to the 
loss of power and oxygen. The Command Module was still in good shape 
and had a ten-hour battery supply remaining, but the crew needed to save 
those batteries for the return trip to Earth. The astronauts shut down the 
Command Module and moved to the Lunar Module for the duration of their 
trip. Because the Service Module was no longer fully functional, the crew had 
to abandon its exploration of the Moon and use the Moon’s gravity to enter a 

73
 Chapter 5: Tragedies in Space
trajectory that could send the spacecraft back toward Earth. Flight control-
lers back at Mission Control assisted the crew with determining these course 
corrections, but not without the watchful eyes and ears of a fearful American 
public thanks to the ongoing television coverage of the event.
Apollo 13’s return to Earth wasn’t without its difficulties, the most prominent 
of which was the fact that the Lunar Module was designed to support only 
two people for two days. (With a little ingenuity that allowed the men to 
retrofit a carbon dioxide “scrubbing” apparatus from the Command Module, 
the Lunar Module ended up supporting all three crew members for four days; 
see Figure 5-2). Little clean drinking water, failures in the remaining oxygen 
tank gauges, and a host of other potential problems plagued the mission, but 
the entire crew made it home safe and sound on April 17.

The causes of the explosion
What problems led to the explosion of Apollo 13’s oxygen tank?
 
✓ The shelf that carried the oxygen tanks had been intended for another 
Apollo mission and had been dropped at one point, causing no exterior 
damage but perhaps some internal damage to the tank that eventually 
exploded.
 
✓ The thermostat inside the oxygen tank wasn’t upgraded to handle a 
65-volt supply after a design change raised the requirement from the 
original 28 volts. All other components aboard the Apollo spacecraft 
were retrofitted to accept the new voltage level.
 
✓ The temperature readout thermometer only displayed temperatures up 
to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius); higher temperatures 
were mistakenly read at 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

74
Part I: Space Exploration: Where, Who, and How 
 
 A fundamental problem with the tank piping was actually uncovered 
during prelaunch testing. Due to this problem, a heater was required to 
fully empty the oxygen tank. Because the thermostat was capable of 
handling only 28 volts, even though the actual power supply used was 
65 volts, the excess electricity welded the thermostat closed, and the 
actual temperature inside the tank ended up being much higher than 
the 100 degrees Fahrenheit that the thermostat could read. Oxygen 
gas evaporated much faster than anticipated, meaning those high 
temperatures had a chance to burn the coating off of the electrical 
wires inside the tank.
 
✓ The stirring procedure set electricity charging through exposed wires, 
which led to sparking and the subsequent explosion.
The consequences of Apollo 13
As a result of the Apollo 13 mission, NASA had to make certain changes to 
avoid a repeat mishap. Technical problems with the tanks, thermostats, and 
heating systems had to be addressed and resolved (although these fixes 
didn’t happen until several years later).
 
One change that was made right away involved increasing the distance 
between the oxygen tanks and installing both a third oxygen tank and an 
emergency battery in a different location on the Service Module. NASA 
practices were also adjusted to reflect the need for testing all systems and 
equipment under a wider range of conditions. One factor that didn’t change, 
though, was the high level of training that astronauts and Earth-bound 
engineers received; it was universally recognized that their creativity and 
cleverness played an enormous role in the astronauts’ survival.

The Space Shuttle Challenger (1986): 
A Launch Ending in Disaster
The Space Shuttle had a healthy track record when the January 28, 1986, 
flight of the Challenger was scheduled for launch. Challenger was the second 
vehicle of the Space Shuttle fleet to be launched into orbit, and it had already 
completed nine successful missions. This tenth voyage was extra-special 
because Christa McAuliffe, a New Hampshire–based teacher and the first 
astronaut to take flight as part of NASA’s Teacher in Space Program, was 
aboard. (The Teacher in Space Program was designed to interest more of the 
general public in the space program.)
The disaster’s cause: An O-ring seal
After several delays due to weather, liftoff of the Space Shuttle Challenger 
on mission STS-51-L proceeded as planned. What happened next was pure 
tragedy. An O-ring seal, located in the right solid rocket booster (SRB) 
failed, creating a breach in the SRB’s joints. Hot gases from the SRB escaped 
through the seal, burning the SRB, the external tank, and the Challenger 
orbiter itself. The SRB ultimately separated from the rocket.
Exactly 73 seconds after liftoff, the orbiter broke into fragments, killing all 
seven crew members onboard when they hit the ocean minutes later (see 
Figure 5-3). Because of the popularity of the Teacher in Space Program, the 
launch was televised live around the world, so millions of people watched 
helplessly as the Challenger crew perished.

✓ Mission Specialist Ronald McNair
 
✓ Payload Specialist Gregory Jarvis
 
✓ Mission Specialist Judith Resnick
 
✓ Educator in Space Christa McAuliffe
The repercussions: A shutdown 
of the Space Shuttle program
 
After Challenger’s demise, the Space Shuttle program was stopped for 32 
months. A governmental commission called the Rogers Commission was 
appointed by President Ronald Reagan to figure out what had happened. The 
conclusions took the commission beyond the O-ring failure and brought to 
light flaws in how NASA addressed known problems, as well as the agency’s 
unwillingness to heed engineering and other warnings. These problems were 
rectified before the Space Shuttle program resumed in 1988.
The Teacher in Space Program, however, couldn’t be resurrected. The 
program, along with other attempts to send private, nonastronaut citizens 
into space, was abandoned after the Challenger disaster. Only in recent 
years has the idea of sending educators into space received serious, renewed 
interest, such as the private Teachers in Space program started by the Space 
Frontier Foundation in 2006. (Check out spacefrontier.org for the full 
scoop on the Space Frontier Foundation.)

On the more-formal front, NASA now has a new program called the Educator

a permanent place in the astronaut corps as mission specialist-educators 
(see the nearby sidebar for more info).
The Space Shuttle Columbia (2003): 
Reentry Disintegration
The Challenger mishap in 1986 occurred shortly after liftoff. Although many 
people think that if something’s going to go wrong in a spaceflight, it’s 
probably going to happen at the beginning of the flight, they’re wrong. 
Ultimate disaster can strike at any time — even at the very end of a 
mission. The disintegration of Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003 is one of the 
most-prominent examples of such a mishap.

Sending teachers to space
NASA’s Teacher in Space Program was 
launched in 1984 as a means to create greater 
general interest in math, space, and science 
among America’s youth. The program was quite 
popular: It had 11,000 applicants in its first year. 
Christa McAuliffe was the chosen one, slated to 
be the first teacher to launch into orbit aboard 
the Space Shuttle Challenger. Barbara Morgan, 
a teacher from Idaho, was McAuliffe’s backup 
and went on to become a full-fledged NASA 
astronaut.
All was not completely lost when the program 
closed down as a result of the Challenger 
disaster. NASA instituted a replacement 
program in the 1990s called the Educator 
Astronaut Program. Instead of training teachers 
as temporary astronauts, the program recruited 
them to become permanent astronauts. 
After their space journeys, participants 
gain employment through NASA (usually as 
mission specialist-educators [MSEs]) instead of 
returning to their teaching careers. The first of 
these MSEs are scheduled for Space Shuttle 
missions in early 2009.
The first group of MSEs to come from the 
Educator Astronaut Program consisted of
 ✓ Joe Acaba
 ✓ Ricky Arnold
 ✓ Dottie Metcalf-Lindenburger

noticed a problem. During the launch, a piece of the Space Shuttle’s foam 
insulation broke loose from the external propellant tank and hit the left wing 
about 82 seconds after liftoff, creating a hole of about 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 
centimeters) in diameter in the spacecraft’s left wing. It may not seem like 
flying foam could cause much of a problem, but remember that the foam was 
flying very quickly: It weighed a little more than a pound (0.45 kilograms) but 
was traveling at around 800 feet (or 244 meters) per second.
Columbia was able to continue its mission, but the wing damage resulted 
in a compromise of the Space Shuttle’s thermal protection system. NASA 
engineers had seen problems with foam coming loose during launch before, 
but historically such launches had been allowed to continue, so there was a 
certain amount of confidence that reentry would proceed as planned. Even if 
the astronauts onboard had realized the problem, there was little they 
could’ve done in the way of repairs.
As Columbia reentered the Earth’s atmosphere at the end of its mission, 
the compromised wing was destroyed by the heat caused by atmospheric 
drag. Normally, Space Shuttle wings get very hot from frictional heat as the 
spacecraft rapidly descends through the Earth’s atmosphere. In this case, 
however, the high-temperature gases penetrated into the interior of the 
damaged wing, leaving it unprotected by the broken heat shielding.
The Space Shuttle started losing its thermal tiles, and ground observers 
witnessed a number of bright flashes. The entire spacecraft soon broke apart 
as it hurtled toward the Earth. People on the ground reported hearing a loud 
boom as the sky filled with smoke and flying debris.
Following are the names of the final crew members of Space Shuttle 
Columbia:
 
✓ Pilot William McCool
 
✓ Payload Specialist Ilan Ramon (from Israel)
 
✓ Payload Commander Michael Anderson
 
✓ Mission Specialist Kalpana Chawla
 
✓ Mission Specialist Laurel Clark
 
✓ Mission Specialist David Brown
The Space Shuttle program stops again
 
As with the Challenger accident in 1986, Columbia’s demise caused the 
Space Shuttle program to cease operations for more than two years. During 
this time, organizational and decision-making procedures at NASA were 
overhauled, and technical design changes were made that would help limit 

79
 Chapter 5: Tragedies in Space
foam detachment in later missions. Special cameras were also added to later 
Space Shuttle missions for purposes of surveying the orbiters’ thermal tiles 
for damage.
This delay in Space Shuttle operations led to a halt of progress on the 
International Space Station, because the Space Shuttle was its primary means 
of receiving supplies and new components. Basic equipment and new 
crew members were supplied by the Russian Federal Space Agency during 
that interim.

P
art II reveals the story of space exploration’s driving 
force in the second half of the 20th century: the Space 
Race. The political struggle between the United States and 
the Soviet Union manifested itself in the skies as the two 
sides competed on an ever-escalating playing field.
First the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1 (the first satellite), 
followed shortly by the first human in orbit. The U.S. played 
catch-up, sending its Mercury and Gemini crews into 
Earth orbit. But landing on the Moon was the ultimate 
prize. After both nations sent robotic spacecraft to orbit 
and land on the Moon, the U.S. gained a decisive victory 
with its Apollo Moon landings. Robotic exploration contin-
ued with missions that took the first close-up views of 
Mars, Venus, and the planets of the outer solar system, 
and astronauts remained in Earth orbit, where they vis-
ited the first space stations. Then in 1975, the Space Race 
came to a symbolic end with a handshake in space on the 
joint American and Soviet Apollo-Soyuz mission.

W
ith the launch of two satellites — Sputnik 1 and Explorer 1 — in the 
1950s, space became a place to go rather than a place to just look 
at. The dawn of space exploration led to a psychological transformation 
in the way humans viewed space. It was no longer merely a place to observe; 
for the first time in the history of humanity, it was a viable destination.
In this chapter, we run through the first artificial satellites, including a 
detailed description of the Soviet Sputnik 1 satellite and its effect on science 
and technological development in the U.S. — in particular, the launch of 
Explorer 1. We also cover early experiments with sending animals (think 
dogs and monkeys) into orbit.
Cold War Tensions and the Space Race
Following the end of World War II, two nations rivaled each other for global 
dominance: the Soviet Union and the United States. One of the major areas in 
which the two countries sought to outdo each other was in the area of space 
exploration.
 
Why space? Well, a combination of technological and political factors 
allowed space exploration to be the subject of competition between the 
two superpowers:
 
✓ Technological readiness was the first factor. Advances in rocketry and 
engineering, along with the upcoming field of computers, meant that 
for the first time in human history, humanity had the skills to leave 
the planet.

84
Part II: The Great Space Race 
 
✓ Politically, space exploration turned out to be a golden opportunity. 
As a relatively new field with little human achievement to date, there 
was an enormous opportunity for someone (and his nation) to take the 
credit for many “firsts”: first human to orbit the Earth, first person to 
walk on the Moon, and so on. The U.S. and the Soviet Union both wanted 
to claim these honors and earn the respect of the entire world, so both 
countries made heavy investments in space science during the years of 
the Space Race (1957–1975).
 
The superpower rivalry between the Soviet Union and the U.S. was described 
as the Cold War, a term that encompasses all the tensions, hostilities, and 
outright competition between the world’s greatest nations following World 
War II. The Soviet Union and the U.S. were both Allied powers during the 
war itself, but they had differing worldviews on what should happen beyond 
the war. That sticky little thing called Communism didn’t help unite the 
countries either.
Although the Cold War had its downsides (accusations of treason, spying, 
a costly American involvement in the Korean and Vietnam conflicts, and a 
massive propaganda machine), it undeniably produced some serious innova-
tion in technology and industry. The buildup of both the Soviet and American 
defense systems was another result of these tensions, as was a race to 
produce and stockpile nuclear arms. The militaristic aspect of the Cold War 
was frighteningly intense, with a series of treaties, wars, and other events 
that solidified the opposition between the two countries. War was never 
officially declared, hence the term Cold War, but these countries and their 
allies soon had divisive political and technological agendas to meet.
Several decades passed before the end of the Cold War; between Soviet 
leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s introduction of glasnost (transparent and open 
government) and perestroika (economic restructuring) and President Ronald 
Reagan’s influence, the Cold War petered out in the late 1980s and early 
1990s. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought further realizations 
of capitalism and a free market to the former Soviet states, which opened the 
door for real collaboration between Russia and the U.S.
Sputnik 1: The First Satellite 
in Orbit (1957)
The opening act of the Space Race was the competition to put a satellite into 
orbit around the Earth. Both superpowers were invested in being the first 
nation to send a satellite into Earth’s orbit, but the first achievement of the 
Space Race went to the Soviet Union.

85
 Chapter 6: A Small Beeping Sphere and the Dawn of the Space Age
Why a satellite? Good question! The idea sprang from the International 
Geophysical Year, the time frame from July 1, 1957, through December 31, 
1958, that scientists designated as a period for coordinated observations of 
the Sun and other bodies in space. Activities included studies of aurora, 
cosmic rays, geomagnetism, and solar activity. Although studying these 
effects from the ground was possible, it occurred to scientists as they set the 
dates for the International Geophysical Year in 1952 that measurements 
could be made much more effectively with an instrument that was actually 
in space.
Previously, scientists made measurements of the upper atmosphere using 
balloons, which could only reach about 25 miles (40 kilometers) above 
the Earth’s surface. Sounding rockets could also take suborbital measure-
ments, closer to the edge of space at 63 miles (100 kilometers) or even 
beyond, but these small rockets remained aloft for just a few minutes before 
falling back to Earth. In contrast, scientists thought an orbiting satellite 
would be able to take measurements for hours or days rather than mere 
minutes. Suddenly, scientific concerns matched up directly with political 
reality, and both the Soviet Union and the United States began working to 
build such a satellite.
In the following sections, we describe the creation of Sputnik 1 and its 
successful launch in more detail.
Developing the little metal 
ball that changed history
Soviet scientists recognized that sending a satellite into orbit would give 
them much-needed information in the pursuit of human spaceflight, so in 
1954, they began the design and development work that led to the Sputnik 1 
satellite. (In fact, their efforts were speeded by news that the U.S. was 
embarking on a similar pursuit.)
Sputnik 1, the world’s first satellite, was a relatively simple device that looked 
very different from modern satellites (check it out in Figure 6-1). It was a 
metallic sphere that measured 23 inches (58.5 centimeters) across and was 
covered with a bright, shiny heat shield made from aluminum, magnesium, 
and titanium. Four long antennae extended nearly 10 feet (3 meters) from 
one side of the sphere. The satellite’s design was primarily chosen for its 
simplicity, strength, and ease of construction; the spherical shape was 
echoed in many future Soviet and Russian spacecraft, such as Soyuz.

Inside the satellite were a battery-operated power supply, very basic environ-
mental controls, and a radio transmitter for sending data back to Earth. 
The radio signal supplied useful information to Earth-bound scientists who 
used its strength to study the Earth’s ionosphere (the very top levels of the 
atmosphere) as well as atmospheric density. Scientists also monitored 
the temperature and pressure inside Sputnik 1, primarily to see whether the 
spacecraft had been hit by any meteorites.
After many tests, and a few failures, Soviet space engineers decided to 
launch Sputnik 1 from a modified R-7 Sputnik rocket. This rocket was actually 
designed as an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) consisting of parallel 
boosters and a sustainer that gave its base a somewhat flowery appearance. 
The R-7 Sputnik is a massive rocket (98 feet [30 meters] tall and weighing 
590,000 pounds [267,000 kilograms]), and although it proved to be a failure as 
an ICBM, its large payload mass made it perfect for launching spacecraft.

87
 Chapter 6: A Small Beeping Sphere and the Dawn of the Space Age
 
The R-7 Sputnik rocket that launched Sputnik 1 went on to enjoy a long and 
healthy life. It was used into the 21st century for launching spacecraft, and it 
also launched many required components to the International Space Station 
(which we describe in detail in Chapter 19).
Celebrating success
The launch of Sputnik 1 proceeded as planned on October 4, 1957, thus 
cementing the Soviet Union’s place in history as the first country to launch 
an artificial satellite into orbit. The Soviet Union notified observers around 
the world to watch for the satellite, which could be seen from the ground 
through binoculars or telescopes as it passed through the night sky. 
Additionally, the radio signal from Sputnik 1 could be heard with a common 
shortwave radio. This beeping signal quickly became a symbol of the Soviet 
Union’s technological prowess.
Although Sputnik 1 didn’t return images or other visual data to Earth, the 
satellite did provide scientists with information about the temperature both 
inside the satellite and on its exterior surface. This data was downlinked after 
the satellite had orbited the Earth once, allowing scientists to gain a better 
understanding of temperatures in space.
The batteries on Sputnik 1 allowed transmission to continue for 22 days. 
The satellite’s orbit gradually deteriorated after that, and it burned up 
in Earth’s atmosphere in early January 1958, after spending about three 
months in orbit.
 
Other robotic spacecraft followed as part of the Soviet Union’s Sputnik pro-
gram, which lasted until it was replaced by the Cosmos spacecraft in 1961. 
However, the most-important achievement of Sputnik 1, that polished, metallic 
sphere in the sky, was, simply, its success. The door was now open for the 
making of history, and the world wouldn’t have long to wait.
Explorer 1: The U.S. Response (1958)
As part of its planning for the International Geophysical Year (explained 
earlier in this chapter), the United States was starting to lay the foundations 
for a satellite program of its own in 1954. Project Orbiter required the com-
bined efforts of the Navy and Army and, like the Soviet Sputnik program, it 
aimed to launch a satellite into orbit before the conclusion of the 
International Geophysical Year. The program wasn’t formally started until 

88
Part II: The Great Space Race 
1957, after Sputnik 1 had already made headlines (and simultaneously 
crushed U.S. visions of technological superiority to the Soviet Union), but its 
designers lost little time in creating a rocket suitable for such a mission. The 
Space Race had begun in earnest, with the U.S. in dire need of catching up.
Racing to create an American satellite
Before the U.S. could develop a satellite to rival Sputnik 1, it needed to create 
a rocket that could launch said satellite. Enter Juno 1, a modified Jupiter-C 
rocket that included an added fourth stage and was completed in 1958. Of 
course, in the three months it took the U.S. to prepare Juno 1, the Soviet 
Union was proving its success in space with the launch of a second Sputnik 
satellite (which was built in just a few weeks).
Explorer 1 was a much smaller satellite than Sputnik 1, because it was limited 
by the size of the available American launch vehicles. (The Soviet Sputnik 
rockets were modified from military applications that had a much larger 
physical launch capability.) Explorer 1 was cylindrical rather than spherical 
(see Figure 6-2) and measured just 80 inches (2 meters) long by 6.25 inches 
(15.9 centimeters) in diameter; its mass was about one-sixth of Sputnik 1’s 
mass. Explorer 1’s mission centered on making several key measurements, 
including reading temperatures, gauging cosmic dust impacts, and detecting 
cosmic rays. Antennae transmitted the spacecraft’s radio signals back 
to Earth.
 
The engineering for Explorer 1 came from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the 
California Institute of Technology. A group of scientists at the State University 
of Iowa, led by Dr. James Van Allen, designed and developed the satellite’s 
instrumentation.

Exploring the results
Explorer 1 achieved orbit on February 1, 1958, formally cementing America’s 
participation in the Space Race. Its orbit ranged from 1,563 miles (2,515 kilo-
meters) above the Earth to 220 miles (354 kilometers), and it managed to 
complete about 12 orbits around the Earth per day. The satellite’s last trans-
mission to Earth was sent on May 23, 1958, and it remained in space until 
1970 when it reentered the Earth’s atmosphere, burning up in the process.
 
Based on the data received from Explorer 1, scientists discovered much about 
the strong radiation in the Earth’s magnetic field. At certain altitudes, the 
sensors aboard Explorer 1 sent back strange readings, and scientists were 
able to confirm these findings in later Explorer missions. This data led to the 
impressive discovery of the Van Allen radiation belt. Fewer cosmic rays were 
detected than scientists had expected, but they attributed that in part to the 
presence of the radiation belt.
More Explorer spacecraft followed the success of Explorer 1; they carried out 
a range of scientific missions and stand among the longest-running spacecraft 
programs in the U.S.
 
Yet perhaps the most-important result of Explorer 1’s success was the forma-
tion of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, more commonly 
known today as NASA, in 1958. The agency’s original mission was “to provide 
for research into the problems of flight within and outside the Earth’s 
atmosphere and for other purposes.” Since 1958, NASA has been responsible 
for worldwide innovations in satellites, probes, orbiting telescopes, space 
stations, and observatories — not to mention human spaceflight!
Animals in Space
Humans aren’t the only living creatures to take flight and travel in space. 
During the early days of the Space Race, various animals took on the role of

astronaut for different purposes. Initially, animals were sent on spacecraft 
to ensure that any creature could survive a trip into Earth’s orbit. (Scientists 
at the time figured it was more acceptable to run such experiments using 
animals rather than humans.) Other experiments focused on the effects of 
very low gravity on oxygen-breathing creatures, as well as the general act of 
being sent into space.
Animal space travel had humble beginnings. The first animals to travel to the 
edge of space were actually fruit flies that hitched a ride aboard a 1947 U.S. 
V-2 rocket to see how they fared under radiation. Fruit flies have since taken 
flight in many other space adventures, yielding valuable scientific data. Later 
years saw many other fish, insects, and mammals taking flight in the name 
of science.
In the following sections, we describe two major groups of animals sent into 
space: dogs from the Soviet Union and primates from the United States.
 
Animals have been integral components of space exploration throughout its 
history. They’ve provided invaluable data that has contributed to humans’ 
ability to better understand space and, of course, to better prepare their 
human counterparts for extended space travel.
The Soviet Union: Dogs in space
Years before the launch of Sputnik 1 (which we describe earlier in this 
chapter), a 1951 rocket launch carried the world’s first two Soviet space 
dogs, Tsygan and Dezik, to the very edge of space. Their suborbital flight 
reached a maximum height of 62 miles (100 kilometers) before their 
capsule returned to Earth where the dogs were retrieved successfully, 
both alive. Many more dogs traveled on later suborbital flights launched 
by the Soviet Union.
 
Perhaps the most-famous Soviet dog in space is Laika, who in 1957 traveled on 
the Sputnik 2 spacecraft. Laika was actually a stray who was trained for space 
travel and became the first dog launched into orbit around the Earth. She rode 
in a specially designed harness that allowed her to change positions but not 
fully turn around inside the cabin.
Laika made it safely into orbit, but she perished a few hours into the flight. 
Numerous theories abound as to why and how she died. The most likely 
explanation is that even though the capsule was equipped with cooling fans 
and food, humidity and temperature levels inside it grew too high because of 
a malfunction with the spacecraft’s thermal insulation and controls. Laika 
probably died from stress and overheating; however, her capsule was never 
intended to return her to Earth. Sputnik 2 burned up as it reentered the 
Earth’s atmosphere about five months after launch.

91
 Chapter 6: A Small Beeping Sphere and the Dawn of the Space Age
 
Another significant Soviet canine spaceflight was that of Belka and Strelka. 
Like Laika, these female dogs were also strays selected mainly for their 
temperaments (calmer females were the preferred choice for canine cosmo-
nauts). They practiced wearing spacesuits, entered simulators and centrifuges 
to get accustomed to the feeling of riding into space, and were exposed to long 
periods of confinement to prepare them for the tiny cabins. In 1960, aboard 
Sputnik 5, Belka and Strelka became the first dogs to survive an orbital launch 
into space and return home safe and alive. Other animals (mice, flies, and a 
rabbit) traveled aboard the same spacecraft, and they all survived the flight 
as well. Thanks to this accomplishment, the Soviet space program was off 
to a flying start with acquiring the knowledge it needed to support human 
space travel.
The United States: Primates in space
In the true spirit of Space Race competition, the United States was developing 
its own program for sending animals into space. The rationale was much 
the same as for the Soviet dog studies (described in the preceding section): 
Engineers were eager to find out how living creatures would react to the 
pressures of microgravity and space travel, but they were far less eager to 
use humans as the first test subjects. (Generally speaking, scientists took as 
many humane precautions as they could to protect the animals’ safety, 
including anesthetizing them before takeoff.)
The first noninsect to board a U.S. spacecraft was Albert, a rhesus monkey 
who was launched on a suborbital flight in 1948 via a V2 rocket that made 
it up to 39 miles (63 kilometers). Albert perished due to suffocation and was 
followed in 1949 by Albert II, whose flight reached a height of 83 miles (134 
kilometers), making him the first monkey in space. Albert II died on impact, 
but he did survive the flight — and that was critical for engineers figuring 
It’s a jungle out there . . . in space
Many countries have launched a wide variety 
of animals into space. Here’s a sampling:
 ✓ France sent rats, mice, cats, and monkeys 
between 1961 and 1967.
 ✓ China launched mice and rats in the 
mid-1960s.
 ✓ The Soviet Union sent a tortoise and a 
variety of other life forms into deep space 
in 1968.
A wider variety of animals made it into space in 
later years. The 1990s saw the launching of 
desert beetles, brine shrimp, Japanese tree 
frogs, newts, crickets, snails, sea urchins, and 
a host of other creatures. Each species was 
chosen for its potential to teach humans some-
thing new.

92
Part II: The Great Space Race 
out the basics of how to stay alive while in space. The next couple of Alberts 
(III and IV) also died on the return trip. A squirrel monkey named Gordo 
survived his 1958 launch on the Jupiter AM-13 but died on reentry because 
of a defect with the rocket’s parachute.
 
The first primate-space-travel success story belongs to a pair of monkeys 
named Able and Baker. In 1959, they were launched on the Jupiter AM-18 
rocket, made it more than 50 miles (80 kilometers) into space, and returned 
home alive. Able perished shortly thereafter due to surgery required to 
remove his medical electrodes, but the fact remained that living humanlike 
creatures had made it into space — and home again! NASA’s work continued.
Ham the Chimpanzee made waves for being the first primate launched in 
Project Mercury (which we describe in detail in Chapter 7). In 1961, Ham was 
rocketed into space, even managing to survive a pressure loss in the capsule 
due to the effectiveness of his spacesuit. Thanks to his training, Ham proved 
that primates could do basic tasks in space (such as pushing levers, a task he 
practiced on Earth and replicated while in space), and his work paved the 
way for Alan Shepard’s Freedom mission later that same year. (Check out an 
image of Ham in the color section.)
 
Another significant chimp was Enos, who trained at the Holloman Air Force 
Base in New Mexico with Ham. Enos became the world’s first chimp to orbit 
the Earth during his successful Mercury-Atlas 5 launch in 1961. What Ham did 
for Shepard, Enos did for John Glenn: With the success of Mercury-Atlas 5, 
Glenn was able to successfully orbit the Earth for the first time on the 1962 
Mercury-Atlas 6 flight.

A
lready playing catch-up after the Soviet Union launched the first 
satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957 (see Chapter 6), the United States fell even 
farther behind in the Space Race when the Soviet Union launched the first 
person into space in 1961. Yuri Gagarin’s revolutionary flight was a triumph 
for the Soviets. The Americans didn’t give up, though. Gagarin’s flight was 
quickly followed up by the first space trips by astronauts from the newly 
formed NASA — Alan Shepard took a suborbital flight in 1961, and John Glenn 
became the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. The first people to 
travel in space became instant worldwide celebrities, and the Space Race 
continued with the American Gemini program and the Soviet Voskhod and 
Soyuz programs.
The Vostok Spacecraft and Its 
Pioneers (1961–1963)
The Soviet Union’s first foray into human spaceflight came in the form of 
the Vostok spacecraft, which was actually intended for use both in human 
spaceflight and as part of the Soviet spy network. The ship itself had two 
parts: The spherical upper portion was the capsule in which the cosmonaut 
and instruments traveled, and the cylindrical bottom portion housed the 
engine and its propellant.

94
Part II: The Great Space Race 
In the following sections, we introduce you to two pioneers of the Vostok 
program: Yuri Gagarin, the first person in space, and Valentina Tereshkova, 
the first woman in space.
Yuri Gagarin, the first human in space
The first spacecraft of the Vostok program was actually a prototype built in 
1960 that didn’t carry any cosmonauts; it did, however, make several auto-
matic missions that helped prepare the designers for the finishing touches 
on the Vostok spacecraft. The first human-carrying spacecraft was Lastochka 
(a Vostok 3KA design). Its first manned mission, named Vostok 1, took place 
on April 12, 1961, and allowed cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin to take the honor of 
being the first human in space.
After launching from the Baikonur Cosmodrome (located in modern-day 
Kazakhstan, this facility was the main launch site of the then-Soviet and 
now-Russian space program), Gagarin completed one orbit around the Earth 
during his 108-minute first experience in space. Gagarin’s spacecraft was put 
on automatic control during the flight because space engineers weren’t sure 
how a human would react to the conditions of weightlessness.
The Soviets didn’t exactly have a sophisticated plan for the spacecraft to 
deliver its passenger safely back to the ground upon the mission’s comple-
tion. Gagarin actually parachuted to a safe landing on the ground from a 
height of about 23,000 feet (7,000 meters) above the Earth. The Vostok 
capsule itself also landed by parachute, but engineers thought that having 
the cosmonaut stay with the capsule posed too great of a physical hazard for 
him due to the anticipated rough landing.
 
Gagarin’s parachute landing was kept secret for many years, because the 
international agency responsible for certifying the world’s first orbital space-
flight required the astronaut to land along with the spacecraft. Soviet officials 
claimed for years that Gagarin did indeed land with his capsule — while still 
allowing cosmonauts on all future Vostok flights to parachute to the ground.
 
Gagarin’s flight made him an instant hero in the Soviet Union. He was lauded 
many times over and quickly became the poster boy for the Space Race 
and the Communist Party. Gagarin was promoted several times in the 
Soviet Air Force, but due to his hero-level status, he was actually prohibited 
from taking on other spaceflight ventures that the government considered 
too risky. With Gagarin’s trip into orbit, the Soviet Union had claimed 
another important “first” in the Space Race, leaving the U.S. to play catch-up 
once again.

95
 Chapter 7: What a Ride! The First People in Space
Valentina Tereshkova, the 
first woman in space
All in all, the Soviets sent six manned Vostok flights into space before the 
program ended in 1963. The last such mission, Vostok 6, wasn’t manned by a 
man at all! Instead, a female cosmonaut named Valentina Tereshkova crewed 
the mission, making her the first woman in space. (At the time, the Soviet 
Union had a separate cosmonaut corps for women, and Tereshkova was one 
of only five women to make the grade.)
 
Tereshkova had a somewhat unusual background, having attended school 
largely through the mail, but her hobby of parachute jumping led her to 
apply for cosmonaut training. This specialty also made her a desirable 
candidate, because parachuting was a required skill for evacuation from 
Vostok spacecraft.
Tereshkova completed the Vostok 6 mission successfully, minus these minor 
onboard mishaps:
 
✓ Several communication lapses occurred between Tereshkova and 
Mission Control.
 
✓ She reported being unable to complete all scheduled experiments 
because some had been positioned beyond her reach.
 
✓ Although she was nauseous for most of the trip, Tereshkova’s debriefing 
notes described the flight as largely pleasant and the food as awful 
(a far cry from the food astronauts get today, which you can read about 
in Chapter 4).
 
Tereshkova’s flight was likely the product of the Soviet Union’s desire 
for another first-place claim in the Space Race. Yet regardless of how she 
got there, her achievement opened the door for the success of future female 
astronauts.

Part II: The Great Space Race 
Project Mercury and Its Lofty 
Goals (1959–1963)
The United States, though bested by the Soviet Union in the race to place the 
first human into orbit, wasn’t without a feisty comeback. NASA (which was 
formally created in 1958 thanks to the success of Explorer 1, as explained in 
Chapter 6) helped develop the first American plan for human spaceflight: 
Project Mercury, which ran from 1959 through 1963. Named in honor of the 
Roman god of speed, Project Mercury had very specific goals: Humans would 
orbit the Earth and return home safely, gathering valuable data about how 
mankind could live, breathe, and work in space in the process. (The program 
also included a number of unmanned missions, as well as a few that sent 
animals into space; see Chapter 6 for more details.)
A variety of governmental agencies were involved in creating the standards 
for selecting the first lucky batch of U.S. astronauts. The president at the 
time, Dwight D. Eisenhower, decreed that these first astronauts should come 
from the military. The candidates had to meet a range of physical and health 
conditions and be able to prove they had experience flying aircraft. Personal 
interviews were conducted, as well as a slew of tests and exams. After 
being subjected to extremely stressful conditions, both physically and 
psychologically, the aptitudes of the potential space pilots were narrowed 
down, and eventually NASA’s first seven astronauts were selected.

We describe the spacecraft and the missions of the Mercury 7 in the 
following sections.
A little snug: The Mercury spacecraft
The spacecraft for the Mercury missions were quite small, due to the size of 
the available launch vehicles. The inhabitable interior space was only about 
60 cubic feet (1.7 cubic meters), and much of that was stuffed with instru-
mentation and controls. The capsule itself measured about 82 inches (2 
meters) by 74 inches (1.9 meters.) A 19-foot (5.8-meters) escape tower 
topped the capsule.
Due to the size constraints, each Mercury mission was crewed by just one 
astronaut. The capsule was equipped with three posigrade rockets, small 
rockets that fired in the direction of motion in order to break the capsule 
away from its launch vehicle. Three different rockets were used as part of the 
Mercury program: Redstone, Atlas, and Little Joe.
Each Mercury capsule also had three solid-fuel retrorockets designed to 
bring the spacecraft back to Earth; only one was necessary, so the system 
had some built-in redundancy to account for potential mechanical failure. 
The capsules were designed to withstand substantial reentry temperatures 
and provided an elaborate system of backup controls in case the astronaut 
inside became incapacitated. As opposed to the Soviet Union’s Vostok 
capsules, which landed on solid ground, the Mercury capsules (as well as 
later NASA spacecraft constructed under the Gemini and Apollo programs) 
were designed to splash down in the ocean, with the crew and capsule 
retrieved via helicopter. You can see an image of a splashdown in the color 
section.

Donald Slayton was the only one of the original Mercury 7 astronauts not to 
get his own mission. He was scheduled to fly on Mercury-Atlas 7 but was 
removed from the flight list after doctors found an irregular heartbeat during 
a training exercise in a centrifuge that simulated the high gravitational 
forces astronauts encounter during takeoff and landing. Slayton served 
as the director of NASA’s flight crew operations until he finally obtained 
medical clearance and got to fly on the Apollo-Soyuz flight (described 
in Chapter 12).
 
You may have noticed that all the capsule names have the number 7 after 
them. Surely they weren’t each the seventh attempt at getting the capsule 
right? Nope. The astronauts were actually given the honor of naming their 
capsules, and all of them chose to use the number 7 to show their support for 
the entire Mercury 7 team.
 
Two Mercury missions are particularly notable:

99
 Chapter 7: What a Ride! The First People in Space
 
✓ Alan Shepard, the first American in space: The astronaut with the 
honor of being the first American in space is none other than Alan 
Shepard. A former flight test pilot in the U.S. Navy, Shepard was invited 
to “audition” for NASA’s new Project Mercury. He soon passed all the 
tests and joined the astronaut crew. Shepard made history when, in 1961 
aboard the Freedom 7 spacecraft, he became the first American (and 
only the second human) to venture into space on a suborbital flight. 
Shepard’s achievement was dwarfed only by Yuri Gagarin’s flight, which 
The Mercury 13: Women who qualified for space
Although history reveals that the first American 
astronauts were all men, that info doesn’t quite 
tell the whole story. Dr. William Lovelace, the 
person responsible for developing the tests that 
helped select the Mercury 7, also solicited 
female recruits for the testing phase. The first 
such candidate, a female pilot named Geraldyn 
“Jerrie” Cobb, was invited to undergo the test-
ing in 1960, and she passed the same three 
phases as the men.
With these results, more women were invited to 
take physiological tests, some of which were 
quite strange. The women were examined, 
poked, prodded, and filmed. Their stomach 
acids and other bodily fluids were tested, as 
were their reflexes, breathing, and balance. The 
group made consistent progress, until the 
training of the final 13 candidates was halted 
when the Naval School of Aviation Medicine in 
Pensacola, Florida refused to allow them to 
continue testing because the program was 
considered unofficial. Even though the Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 had made gender discrimina-
tion illegal, NASA claimed the women were 
ineligible because they weren’t allowed to 
attend Air Force training schools at the time, 
and one of the astronaut requirements was 
to be a graduate of a military jet test pilot 
program. NASA refused to grant exemptions for 
comparable experience, as they had in the 
cases of some male astronauts, despite the fact 
that some of the women already had the 
required engineering degrees and civilian test 
pilot experience.
Despite cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova 
making waves with her flight in 1963 (see the 
related section earlier in this chapter for 
details), the minds of NASA’s powers-that-be 
remained unchanged, and the so-called 
Mercury 13 weren’t able to proceed with astro-
naut training. As a result, the first American 
female astronaut, Sally Ride, didn’t make her 
way into space until 1983.

occurred a month earlier. Even though Gagarin orbited the Earth and 
Shepard only reached the edge of space, Shepard was still celebrated as 
a hero in the U.S. for being the first American in space.
 
✓ John Glenn, the first American to orbit the Earth: Another famous 
American astronaut, John Glenn, broke new ground by becoming the 
first American to orbit the Earth. Glenn joined NASA after a career in the 
U.S. Marine Corps. He made history in 1962 when he voyaged around the 
Earth on the Friendship 7 spacecraft. Glenn led a long and storied career 
with NASA and as a long-serving U.S. senator. In addition to his Project 
Mercury–related work, Glenn became the world’s oldest astronaut when 
he took a ride on the Space Shuttle Discovery in 1998.
Voskhod 2 and the First 
Spacewalk (1965)
 
Another first in the Space Race went to the Soviet Union with the 1965 
Voskhod 2 mission. Led by cosmonauts Alexei Leonov (pilot) and Pavel 
Belyayev (commander), Voskhod 2 was a modified version of the original 
Vostok spacecraft. The major differences included an extra solid rocket 
booster for backup, additional seating, and an exterior airlock. This airlock 
was required for the prime goal of the mission, which was met when Leonov 
made the world’s first spacewalk. Technically called an extravehicular activity 
(EVA), the ten-minute spacewalk marked the first time that a human had 
left the safety of a spacecraft and braved the vacuum of space, protected only 
by a spacesuit.
Although this mission made history with Leonov’s spacewalk, it wasn’t 
without its problems:
 
✓ The spacewalk itself was a success, but Leonov narrowly avoided 
disaster when his spacesuit became unexpectedly rigid in the vacuum 
of space and he had difficulty fitting back through the airlock to reenter 
the capsule.
 
✓ Following the spacewalk, the post-spacewalk hatch seal wasn’t good, 
leading to an excess of oxygen in the cabin, which raised the risk of a 
fire (but none occurred).
 
✓ With the mission almost over, the systems responsible for the ship’s 
reentry (specifically, the retrorockets) failed, leading to the cosmonauts 
having to make a hard, manual landing in a snowy Siberian forest far 
from the waiting recovery crews. The men were stranded in the woods 
overnight while rescue crews raced their way. (Fortunately, they landed 
in their capsule rather than parachuting as the Vostok crews had done, 
so at least they had minimal shelter and survival gear.)

101
 Chapter 7: What a Ride! The First People in Space
The overall Voskhod 2 mission had enough problems that the rest of the 
Voskhod series of missions was canceled.
The Gemini Program Proves 
Its Case (1965–1966)
With the successes of Project Mercury (described earlier in this chapter) 
firmly establishing the United States as a force to be reckoned with in the 
Space Race, American politicians, engineers, scientists, and the general 
public wanted more. Simply sending one astronaut into a brief orbit was 
no longer satisfactory. People across the nation clamored for longer flights, 
bigger crews, and more-advanced spacecraft that could raise the bar for 
space travel and rival the accomplishments of the Soviet Union. These 
cries were answered in NASA’s second manned spaceflight program, Project 
Gemini.
Formally undertaken in 1962, shortly before the completion of its predeces-
sor (Project Mercury), Project Gemini was named after the constellation 
Gemini, whose name means twins in Latin. This association with twins was 
meant to signify the main innovation of the Gemini spacecraft: It could carry 
two crew members, not just one.
Project Gemini had well-defined goals that were simple enough for any citizen 
to understand:
 
✓ Develop manned spacecraft that could sustain a spaceflight lasting up to 
two weeks.
 
✓ Meet and dock with other vehicles in space.

✓ Land on the ground in a controlled glide instead of parachuting into the 
water. (This goal was replaced during the design phase in 1964 with the 
more-familiar splashdown water landing, but the precision control of 
the landing site was still demonstrated.)
The first two overall Project Gemini goals were met successfully, as you can 
see in the following sections. Although none of the missions landed on solid 
ground, Gemini XI proved that computer-controlled landings were possible, 
and the project achieved around 1,000 man-hours of experience in space.

Two-person crews and longer flights
The Gemini spacecraft was based on the Mercury space capsule, but it was 
enlarged enough to support a two-person crew. The capsule measured 19 
feet (5.8 meters) long with a diameter of 10 feet (3 meters), and its interior 
was redesigned for the astronauts’ ease of movement. The ship was sent into 
space by the Titan II rocket.
The first manned launch of a Gemini spacecraft came with the Gemini 3 
mission, which launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida 
on March 23, 1965. This mission was crewed by two NASA astronauts: 
Commander Virgil “Gus” Grissom and Pilot John Young. Grissom nicknamed 
the capsule “Molly Brown,” from the popular Broadway play The Unsinkable 
Molly Brown, in a tongue-in-cheek reference to his sunken Mercury space 
capsule (see Chapter 5 for a description of this early disaster in the U.S. space 
program).

104
Part II: The Great Space Race 
 
Alan Shepard was originally scheduled to command the Gemini 3 mission, but 
an inner ear problem kept him firmly on the ground.
The main goal of the Gemini 3 voyage was to prove that a two-member crew 
could survive a trip into space. Side goals were to practice maneuvering 
in space and come down in a more-controlled landing than had been seen 
in the days of Project Mercury. A variety of experiments and tests were 
planned, and medical data from the two crew members were collected.
 
Unlike the Mercury space capsules, which allowed the astronauts to make 
only slight adjustments to the spacecraft’s orientation, Gemini astronauts 
could change the orbit of their space capsules. The Gemini 3 astronauts 
performed the first orbital maneuver during their flight, meaning they changed 
the size and period of their orbit midflight by firing maneuvering thrusters 
at carefully calculated orientations and durations. The Gemini 3 crew 
successfully changed the shape of its orbit from elliptical to circular and later 
decreased the orbit’s altitude above the Earth. This sort of control over a 
spacecraft was unprecedented up to this point in NASA history.
Although the Mercury and early Gemini missions relied on batteries for 
power, NASA engineers knew that longer-duration missions — like those 
required for a trip to the Moon — needed long-lasting power. The later 
Gemini missions employed fuel cells for their onboard power needs. These 
electrochemical devices use hydrogen as a fuel source and oxygen as an 
oxidizer, and give off water as waste. Fuel cells, as well as improvements in 
spacecraft control that allowed conservation of fuel for orbital maneuvers, 
allowed for new endurance records, such as Gemini 7’s 13 day-mission.
Rendezvous and docking in space
 
One of the most-significant historical achievements of Project Gemini was 
its ability to prove that rendezvous and docking activities could take place 
in space. These techniques were considered critical forbearers for a lunar 
mission, which was one of the ultimate goals of the U.S. space program. 
The target for these spacecraft docks was the Agena spacecraft, a separate 
unmanned spacecraft designed by NASA to provide a place for other space 
vehicles to practice docking in space.
The first planned Gemini space rendezvous would’ve taken place during the 
Gemini V mission in 1965, but the experimental fuel cells used on this flight 
provided a few glitches that depleted the ship’s power reserves and made a 
docking experiment impossible. Gemini VI also had a planned rendezvous, 
but the entire mission was scrapped when the Agena target vehicle exploded 
on launch.

105
 Chapter 7: What a Ride! The First People in Space
After a quick change in plans, Gemini 7 was launched before Gemini 6A in 
order to become the latter’s new target vehicle. The ships successfully 
rendezvoused on December 15, 1965, flying to within 1 foot (30 centimeters) 
of each other while in orbit around the Earth. Figure 7-1 shows the view of 
Gemini 7 from Gemini 6A.
Docking experiments were right around the corner. Gemini 8 was launched 
on March 16, 1966, and it successfully rendezvoused with a new Agena target 
vehicle that had been successfully launched ahead of time. The docking 
proceeded without a hitch, and the two vehicles were joined together in 
space. (An extended spacewalk was planned for this same mission but had to 
be canceled due to a stuck thruster on the Gemini 8.)

Hold the mustard?
In addition to its more academic and scientific 
role in making history, the Gemini 3 mission also 
introduced the world’s first space deli. Astronaut 
John Young snuck a corned beef sandwich 
onboard the flight. Aside from the risk that the 
floating bread crumbs posed to the spacecraft’s 
equipment and controls, astronauts bringing 
along covert sandwiches distracted them from 
the more-important scientific goal of testing the 
rehydration and preparation of NASA’s space 
food. Needless to say, future astronauts were 
warned rather strenuously about the dangers of 
space takeout.

106
Part II: The Great Space Race 
 
While docked to the Agena, the Gemini spacecraft began to spin slowly. 
Following procedure, the astronauts undocked, only to find that their ship 
was now spinning at a rate of one spin per minute. After a few harrowing 
minutes, Neil Armstrong, in his first spaceflight, was able to recover control 
of the spacecraft. The ship then made an emergency return to Earth; the 
total Gemini 8 flight lasted just 10 hours and 41 minutes. Armstrong’s quick 
thinking and levelheadedness during this emergency likely helped in his 
selection as the first moonwalker of Project Apollo (which we cover in detail 
in Chapter 9).
Soyuz: The Space Program That Keeps 
on Running (1967–Present)
The Soviet Union had its own response to the achievements of the United 
States’ Mercury and Gemini programs: the Soyuz program. Begun in the 
1960s, this Soviet space program involved both a Soyuz launch vehicle and 
a Soyuz spacecraft. It was originally conceived to test orbital docking and 
multicrew missions, with the intent of leading up to a trip to the Moon. The 
Soyuz program was meant to be a technologically advanced replacement for 
its problem-plagued Voskhod predecessor (which we cover earlier in this 
chapter). The Soviet Union’s space program fell farther and farther behind, 
however, due to technical and political reasons, while NASA’s Project Gemini 
(described in the previous section) put the U.S. firmly in the lead in the 
Space Race.
The original Soyuz launch vehicle was a three-stage kerosene and liquid 
oxygen propellant rocket (see Chapter 3 for more about how rockets work). 
Its design was simple but proved to be cheap and reliable over the years 
of its use. The first flight of a Soyuz rocket was in 1966; modified versions 
are still flying today. One of the main innovations of the Soyuz rocket is that 
it can be assembled on its side and then raised to a vertical position for 
launch (check out Figure 7-2). The Soyuz rocket is used to launch commercial 
payloads and send the Soyuz spacecraft into orbit.
The major counterpart to the Soyuz rocket is the Soyuz spacecraft, a three-
part ship consisting of an orbital module, a reentry module, and a service 
module (see Figure 7-3). Overall dimensions are 8.9 feet (2.7 meters) wide by 
23.6 feet (7.2 meters) long; solar panels on the service module, when fully 
extended, increase the total width of the spacecraft to 34.8 feet (10.6 meters). 
It can carry a crew of up to three cosmonauts. The three main portions 
of the Soyuz spacecraft were designed to fit together and come apart as 
components:
 
✓ The reentry module, which contains the inhabitable space that the 
cosmonauts require, is the only portion that has to be able to come 
back to Earth.

107
 Chapter 7: What a Ride! The First People in Space
 
✓ The orbital, or habitation, module provides extra living space while 
in orbit.
 
✓ The service module houses the engines and other support systems, as 
well as solar panels to provide extra power in orbit.

This design approach, in which the orbital and service modules are jettisoned 
on the ship’s return to Earth and burn up in the atmosphere on their way 
home, has a huge advantage for space travel. Because these modules aren’t 
intended to protect human life during a fiery descent, they don’t require the 

108
Part II: The Great Space Race 
same shielding, or means of slowing themselves down, that the reentry 
module does. By limiting these comparatively expensive design components 
to just one module, the Soyuz spacecraft is able to expand its inhabitable 
space while keeping itself as light as possible. The Soyuz capsule itself lands 
on the ground, using a system of parachutes (to slow its descent) and braking 
engines fired just before landing (to soften the impact of landing).
Soyuz 1, which launched on April 23, 1967, was the first manned Soyuz flight. 
Cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov survived the launch and daylong excursion, 
but he perished upon landing. This disaster seriously delayed progress 
toward a Soviet mission to the Moon. (See Chapter 5 for more about the 
Soyuz 1 mission and other space disasters.)
The first Soyuz success with manned spaceflight was the Soyuz 3 mission, 
which was launched on October 26, 1968, and led by Georgi Beregovoi. 
Its main goal was to attempt a rendezvous and docking with the unmanned 
Soyuz 2 spacecraft. Although Soyuz 3 is significant for being the first 
successful manned flight of the Soyuz program because Beregovoi survived 
landing, the ship failed to dock with the Soyuz 2 (although it did manage a 
successful rendezvous).
 
Perhaps the most-remarkable aspect of the Soyuz program is its expandability 
and longevity. Since the late 1960s, Soyuz spacecraft have been modified and 
reconfigured for a huge range of space applications. Some have never left 
the planning stages, whereas others came to fruition, as you find out in the 
following list:
 
✓ Original Soyuz manned spacecraft: Designed for orbital maneuvering 
around the Earth (1967–1971)
 
✓ Soyuz 7K-L1: Planned for lunar exploration and designed to be capable 
of navigating around the Moon (failed test flights 1967–1970)
 
✓ Military Soyuz: Planned for transporting crew and supplies to military 
space outposts (never flew)
 
✓ Soyuz 7K-T and 7K-TM: Used to transport crew to Soviet civilian and 
military space stations (1973–1981); docked with Apollo in 1975 (see 
Chapter 12)
 
✓ Soyuz T: Modified to allow crew to wear pressure suits and to 
accommodate longer flights (1976–1986)
 
✓ Soyuz TM: Upgraded radio communications and the maneuvering 
system; brought crews to Mir and the International Space Station 
(1986–2003; see Chapter 13)
 
✓ Soyuz TMA: Currently travels to the International Space Station and can 
hold taller astronauts (2003–present; see Chapter 19)

A
lthough human visitation of the Moon was a major goal for both 
participants in the Space Race, the Americans and Soviets recognized 
that robotic missions (also known as unmanned missions) were a necessary 
first step. And what steps they were! Some of the early achievements were 
especially spectacular, such as the Soviet Union’s automated soil sample 
return (which has yet to be replicated from another moon or planet) and 
the robotic Moon Rover Lunokhod (not replicated until the 1997 Mars 
Pathfinder Rover Sojourner). Major achievements such as these propelled 
space research to new heights and previously unachievable goals.
First to the Moon with 
Luna (1959–1976)
The Soviet Union’s first foray into robotic missions to the Moon took the 
form of the Luna Program. Forty-five missions were attempted but only about 
one-third of the launches resulted in successful flights between 1959 and 
1976. The rest of the flights either didn’t launch or didn’t accomplish their 
missions. Despite the relatively large number of failures and no-shows, the 
Soviet Luna Program accomplished many significant achievements in space 
exploration.

110
Part II: The Great Space Race 
Early Luna missions: Setting 
the stage (1959–1968)
The Luna spacecraft were redesigned over the course of the Luna Program. 
The earliest versions were intended to simply crash-land on the Moon, 
whereas later models were designed as soft landers and lunar orbiters. In 
addition to their primary lunar missions, the Luna spacecraft were equipped 
with meteoroid and radiation detectors, as well as equipment to take a range 
of other measurements during space travel.
Highlights of the early Luna missions include the following:
 
✓ Luna 1, launched in 1959, had a spherical design reminiscent of the 
Sputnik 1 satellite that had been put into orbit around Earth just two 
years before (flip to Chapter 6 for details on Sputnik 1). Luna 1 missed 
its intended impact on the Moon due to a problem with the controls in 
the launch vehicle, but it was the first spacecraft in the world to go into 
orbit around the Sun and do a lunar flyby.
 
✓ Luna 2, launched later in 1959, was the first spacecraft to impact the 
Moon. A major scientific accomplishment of this hard landing (in which 
a spacecraft impacts the surface of a planet or satellite at a high speed 
without braking with parachutes or retrorockets) was acquiring the 
understanding that the Moon lacked a significant magnetic field.
 
✓ Luna 3, which also launched in 1959, introduced photography to space 
history. It was equipped with cameras that photographed the far side 
of the Moon. The photographs weren’t incredibly clear, but they did 
show distinct mountainous sites in addition to darker areas. This new 
information fueled the imaginations of scientists, skeptics, and the 
general public alike.
 
✓ Luna 9, launched in 1966, was the first spacecraft to successfully land on 
the Moon. It was designed as a cylindrical spacecraft with a lander on 
top; this basic design was used for Luna 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 13 (launched 
between 1963 and 1966). After touchdown, the lander could then right 
itself and open a series of petals that housed telecommunications equip-
ment and cameras. The Luna 9 cameras took a series of photographs 
(later assembled into a panoramic view) that became an instant part of 
the world’s historical record (see Figure 8-1).
 
✓ Subsequent Luna incarnations (Luna 10, 11, 12, and 14, launched in 1966, 
1966, 1966, and 1968, respectively) focused on achieving lunar orbits 
and photographing the Moon’s surface with more detail, as well as 
making more-advanced measurements and studying the Moon’s surface 
and atmosphere.

Luna 16, 20, and 24: Sending samples 
to Earth (1970 and 1976)
The next wave of Luna spacecraft had the lofty goal of sending a little bit of 
the Moon back home to Earth. These Luna missions had landers onboard 
that were capable of gathering a soil sample from the Moon and launching a 
capsule containing that sample back to Earth. These landers were able to 
drill down into the Moon’s surface, fill the hollow arm of the drill with soil, 
and send that arm home in the return capsule.
Luna 15 was launched in July 1969 — just three days before NASA’s Apollo 11 
mission sent the first astronauts to the Moon (see Chapter 9 for details). By 
this point, the Soviets had all but conceded the Space Race to the Americans, 
but they saw Luna 15’s ability to return a lunar soil sample to Earth before 
the Apollo 11 team returned as one last chance for glory. However, they lost 
contact with the spacecraft during its final descent to the lunar surface 
(where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had already made their footprints); 
Luna 15 most likely crashed into the side of a mountain on its way down.
Luna 16, which was launched on September 12, 1970, successfully drilled 
for Moon dirt, landing and working near the Moon’s Mare Fecunditatis 
(Sea of Fertility) area. Samples of the lunar surface were successfully 
returned to Earth 12 days after the spacecraft launched. At this point, 
American astronauts had already brought back soil and rock samples from 
both the Apollo 11 and Apollo 12 missions, but this automated sample return 
was still a technological coup for the Soviets. Another automated sample 
return mission in 1970, Luna 20, successfully returned a sample of the ancient 
lunar highlands. A final automated sample return mission in 1976 made 
Luna 24 the last spacecraft to make a soft landing on the Moon.
 
The Luna soil samples were the first fully robotic sample return missions, a 
record that stood for decades. They also greatly increased the diversity of 
lunar sites from which samples were collected. Scientists back on Earth used 
the samples to learn about the geologic history of the Moon and study the 
differences in composition between the old lunar highlands and the younger 
volcanic plains.

112
Part II: The Great Space Race 
Lunokhod 1 and 2 aboard Luna 17 and 
21: Driving robots (1970 and 1973)
NASA’s recent Mars Pathfinder and Mars Exploration Rovers (which we high-
light in Chapters 15 and 20), although infinitely impressive, weren’t the first 
robotic rovers to have conducted science on another planet. The Soviet 
Lunokhod rover used cameras and other equipment to take photographs and 
test the soil on the Moon. Solar panels unfolded to provide enough electricity 
to run the rover and its instruments. Lunokhod 1 (launched aboard Luna 17 in 
1970) traveled the Moon for about 11 months. Its follow-up, Lunokhod 2 
(launched aboard Luna 21 in 1973) only survived about four months following 
landing, but it drove more than 23 miles (37 kilometers) on the lunar surface. 
For comparison, as of early 2009, the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity has 
traveled more than 8 miles (13 kilometers) over the five years since it landed.
 
The two Lunokhod rovers were driven by Earth-bound controllers who used 
real-time television camera images onboard the spacecraft to operate them 
remotely. This technique works on the Moon, which is close enough to the 
Earth that signals take just about a second to travel from one body to the 
other. However, rovers on Mars must be completely autonomous, because the 
time delay there varies between 3 and 22 minutes, depending on the positions 
of the two planets in their orbits.
Photographing the Moon on the Zond missions
To prepare for a planned Moon mission by 
Soviet cosmonauts, the Soviet Union also 
launched a series of Zond missions in the late 
1960s and 1970. These robotic spacecraft were 
meant to test future hardware to be used by 
cosmonauts, but a series of four Zond missions 
also took some spectacular images of both the 
Moon and the Earth from orbit.
 ✓ Zond 5, launched in 1968, went around the 
Moon and then landed safely on Earth. 
It took images of the Earth but failed to 
capture pictures of the Moon.
 ✓ Later in 1968, Zond 6 carried an automatic 
film camera and took more than 150 
pictures. Unfortunately, the film canister 
broke open when the capsule crash-landed 
on its return to Earth. A few pictures were 
recovered.
 ✓ Zond 7, launched in 1969, successfully 
took images of the Earth and Moon on 
both color and black-and-white film; 
these images were returned to Earth 
without incident.
 ✓ In 1970, Zond 8 took very high-resolution 
images on very large film. Believe it or not, 
these photos rival today’s digital images in 
quality.

113
 Chapter 8: Sending Robots to the Moon
The Ranger Program: Hard Lunar 
Landings (1961–1965)
In the true spirit of the Space Race, the Soviet Union’s Luna missions 
compelled the United States to simultaneously develop its own series of 
robotic lunar missions that could photograph the Moon’s surface. The 
spacecraft of the Ranger Program were intended to impact the Moon, taking 
pictures along the way with their six cameras (each one was intended to 
supply a different photograph through its unique lenses and settings).
The first six Ranger spacecraft in the program (launched between August 
1961 and January 1964) all failed to return useful pictures for various 
reasons, such as the spacecraft’s inability to escape Earth’s orbit, the ship’s 
loss of contact with Earth, or camera failures. One spacecraft, Ranger 3, even 
missed the Moon completely!
 
The loss of six spacecraft in a row had to be discouraging for the Ranger team 
and the newly formed NASA. The failures were probably the result of a combi-
nation of different factors, including the required sterilization of the spacecraft 
before launch for planetary protection reasons (see Chapter 11 for more on 
this topic). One particular issue was discovered just before Ranger 6 was to 
launch: Tiny gold-plated diodes, which were used in many of the Ranger 
spacecraft’s systems, turned out to produce gold flakes that could peel off 
and float around in zero gravity, producing unwanted connections that caused 
the diodes to short-circuit. The diodes were replaced in subsequent Ranger 
missions, including Ranger 6, which was successful except for a failed camera 
switch due to a lightning strike during launch.
Fortunately for the U.S. space program, the next few Ranger missions were 
much more successful. Ranger 7 (also launched in 1964) made it into orbit as 
planned and was able to return more than 4,000 photos before crash-landing 
on the Moon’s surface. Ranger 8 (launched in 1965) sent home more than 
7,000 photos. Last in the Ranger series, Ranger 9 launched on March 21, 1965, 
and completed its chief mission of impacting the Moon and sending 5,800 
high-resolution photographs back home.
The Lunar Orbiter Project: Prepping 
the Way for Human Spaceflight 
(1966–1967)
Although manned spaceflight was always the ultimate goal of NASA’s Moon 
program, everyone understood that it was necessary to first know a lot 
more about the Moon’s surface. Toward this end, NASA promoted the Lunar 

114
Part II: The Great Space Race 
Orbiter Project, a series of five missions launched between 1966 and 1967. The 
project’s goal was to use high-resolution photos and other data to create a 
map of the Moon’s surface, paying particular attention to the areas that NASA 
considered prime candidates for a future astronaut mission (see Figure 8-2).
Five robotic missions occurred as part of the Lunar Orbiter series:
 
✓ Lunar Orbiter 1 (launched August 10, 1966)
 
✓ Lunar Orbiter 2 (launched November 6, 1966)
 
✓ Lunar Orbiter 3 (launched February 5, 1967)
 
✓ Lunar Orbiter 4 (launched May 4, 1967)
 
✓ Lunar Orbiter 5 (launched August 1, 1967)
In the following sections, we describe how the missions not only helped 
scientists map the Moon but also made a surprise achievement: capturing 
the first image of Earth in its entirety.

Mapping the Moon from a distance
 
Unlike some other space mission programs, all of NASA’s Lunar Orbiter 
missions were a startling success. They managed to map out about 99 percent 
of the Moon’s surface, with a minimum resolution of 197 feet (60 meters) per 
pixel; at its best, the resolution was around 3 feet (1 meter) per pixel. This 
achievement was a truly amazing feat because scientists could visualize the 
entire surface of the Moon for the very first time.

 Chapter 8: Sending Robots to the Moon
The Lunar Orbiter spacecraft measured about 5.4 feet (1.65 meters) in length 
by 4.9 feet (1.5 meters) in diameter and had a three-part, mechanical-looking 
design. The base portion contained the battery and other necessary equip-
ment, including the photography gear. The middle module contained propel-
lant, tanks, and sensors; and the upper deck provided the heat shield. Solar 
panels extended from the base to power the equipment and charge the 
spacecraft’s battery.
The imaging system aboard the Lunar Orbiter spacecraft was very advanced. 
It included a dual-lens camera for both high-resolution and wider, lower-
resolution photos, along with a module specifically for processing the used 
film. Other instruments included a readout scanner and a film-handling appa-
ratus. Because the spacecraft itself was in motion, the engineers designed 
the film to move accordingly so that the resulting photos wouldn’t appear 
blurry. After the images were exposed, the film was developed, scanned, and 
converted into signals that the spacecraft’s antennae transmitted back home 
to Earth.
Seeing a whole Earth
Thanks to a slight approved detour by Lunar Orbiter 1, the Lunar Orbiter 
Project gave the world its first picture of the Earth in its entirety. You can 
check out the inspirational image in Figure 8-3.
 
This historic photo, snapped on August 23, 1966, was taken about 236,000 
miles (380,000 kilometers) from the Earth. Perhaps for the first time, it hit 
home that Planet Earth was but one cog in the universe. It also became clear 
that, at least from a distance, the Earth was one united entity.

Part II: The Great Space Race 
The Lunar Surveyor Program: Landing 
on the Moon (1966–1968)
In the mid- to late 1960s, both competitors in the Space Race kept the 
ultimate goal of sending astronauts to the Moon in sight. The United States’ 
next effort after the Lunar Orbiter Project was the Lunar Surveyor Program, a 
NASA project that ran between 1966 and 1968 and landed the first American 
spacecraft on the Moon. Seven robotic spacecraft were sent to the Moon 
during that time, primarily to test techniques and scout out landing spots for 
the Apollo missions (which we describe in Chapters 9 and 10):
 
✓ Surveyor 1 (launched May 30, 1966; see an image of this launch in the 
color section)
 
✓ Surveyor 2 (launched September 20, 1966)
 
✓ Surveyor 3 (launched April 17, 1967)
 
✓ Surveyor 4 (launched July 14, 1967)
 
✓ Surveyor 5 (launched September 3, 1967)
 
✓ Surveyor 6 (launched November 7, 1967)
 
✓ Surveyor 7 (launched January 7, 1968)
 
The Lunar Surveyor Program originally included orbiters and landers, but the 
number and types of spacecraft used were scaled back due to cost and time 
constraints. After all, the Space Race really was a race. Both the Soviet Union 
and the U.S. wanted to be the first to make major achievements in space. 
Thus, time was of the essence in ensuring their respective places in history. 
Presenting the master robotic photographer 
of the 20th century
The photographs taken by the Lunar Orbiters in 
1966 and 1967 were made long before the 
advent of digital photography. Unlikely as it may 
seem today, these photos were exposed onto 
70-millimeter film! The Lunar Orbiter’s imaging 
system, which scanned film, was a compromise 
between the low-resolution television camera 
systems on spacecraft such as the United 
States’ Ranger and designs that returned 
physical film to Earth in a capsule (such as the 
Soviet Union’s Zond spacecraft).
The volume of information returned by the 
various Lunar Orbiters, as archived in high-
resolution photographs, was actually far 
greater than that returned by many modern 
digital spacecraft. The U.S. Geological Survey is 
currently engaged in a long-term project 
to digitize all the Lunar Orbiter data to make 
it available to modern image-processing 
techniques.

117
 Chapter 8: Sending Robots to the Moon
The mandate to focus the Lunar Surveyor Program on lunar landings was 
sanctioned at the highest level of the U.S. government by President John F. 
Kennedy, which helped focus the program’s goals but also limited the amount 
of science the missions could accomplish — for good reason. By doing a 
faster series of test and data-gathering missions, more of the actual science 
could be done by the people who were slated to land on the Moon during 
Project Apollo.
 
Like the many other programs that preceded it, the Lunar Surveyor Program 
laid the groundwork for the human missions that were yet to come. Without 
this important background work, mission planners wouldn’t have been able to 
target landing sites, understand and prepare for the properties of the lunar 
surface, optimize the instruments and techniques to be used, and safely send 
humans to the Moon.
Testing soft-landing techniques
The main goal of the Lunar Surveyor missions was to practice and perfect a 
soft landing (where landing speed is controlled by retrorockets that allow 
the spacecraft to land gently) on the lunar surface. This goal was in direct 
preparation for Project Apollo, which would place the first Americans on the 
Moon’s surface just a few years later. Even though these spacecraft were 
capable of landing without crashing, they didn’t have the capability to launch 
themselves all the way back home.
Although most of the Lunar Surveyor flights were successful, some glitches 
did occur. Surveyor 4, for example, made a perfect flight to the Moon but lost 
contact with Earth during its final descent. Surveyor 2 also had a good flight 
until it crash-landed on the Moon due to engine failure. The other five flights 
landed successfully.
Capturing the details of 
the Moon’s surface
The Lunar Surveyors were equipped with television cameras for photo-
graphing details of the lunar surface. These cameras could pan around to 
take multidirectional photos and photograph the lunar surface from different 
heights. Each spacecraft also had equipment to measure the surface 
temperature of the Moon and test the radar reflectivity and strength of its 
surface. In fact, more than 100 sensors were stashed aboard Surveyor 1.
A scoop added late in the project provided the capability for later Lunar 
Surveyors to dig a trench in the Moon’s surface, which the cameras could 
then photograph so that scientists back home could study the lunar soil’s 
composition. Without these critical bits of info, engineers wouldn’t have 
known which parts of the Moon’s surface would be capable of supporting the 
landing of an Apollo spacecraft.

118
Part II: The Great Space Race 
 
One of the most-significant discoveries of the Lunar Surveyor missions was 
that the Moon’s surface was firmer than expected, a fact that boded well for a 
future Apollo landing because previously scientists had worried that so-called 
“Moon dust” would prevent an easy landing.
Making the Apollo 12 connection
A special connection existed between the Lunar Surveyor Program and 
Project Apollo: The Apollo 12 mission was intentionally targeted to land near 
the Surveyor 3 spacecraft. Astronauts studied Surveyor 3 to view the effects 
of more than two and a half years on the lunar surface. They detached the 
spacecraft’s camera and a few other components to bring back to Earth for 
further analysis (see Figure 8-4).
The astronauts found that the components of Surveyor 3 were in surprisingly 
good shape after their stint in the harsh lunar environment. Perhaps the 
most widely reported result was the claim that a terrestrial bacterium, 
Streptococcus mitis, was found inside the Surveyor 3 camera and thus must 
have survived exposure to harsh lunar conditions. If true, that would make 
the case for stringent planetary protection constraints to prevent contamina-
tion of possible nonterrestrial ecosystems. More-recent analysis, however, 
has suggested that the camera was probably contaminated with the bacte-
rium sometime after its retrieval.

L
anding on the Moon was a far-away dream for engineers, NASA 
scientists, politicians, and just about everyone else in the world during 
the early 1960s. Thanks to the breakthroughs and achievements of the 
United States’ Project Apollo, those dreams became reality just a few short 
years later — a reality witnessed by anyone with access to a television on 
July 20, 1969. The landing of astronauts on the Moon, as part of the Apollo 11 
mission, is arguably one of the greatest human achievements ever. If you 
want to discover how this mission was possible, and find out about the many 
initial missions required to achieve it, then this chapter is for you.
In the Beginning: The Politics 
of Manned Lunar Exploration
The major impetus of Project Apollo was political. In order to place America 
squarely in the lead during the Space Race of the 1960s, the highest levels of 
American government had to get involved, and President John F. Kennedy 
rose to the challenge. The Apollo program’s stated goals — to meet the 
“national interests” of the United States in space as well as to establish its 
dominance beyond Earth — echoed this winner-take-all sentiment. Of equal 
importance, and the real means of achieving those first two goals, was 
executing significant scientific work on the Moon and developing the ability 
for people to work and function there.
In the following sections, we describe Kennedy’s desires for the space 
program and the work NASA did immediately following the announcement 
of Kennedy’s goal.

120
Part II: The Great Space Race 
President John F. Kennedy’s goal: 
Winning the race to the Moon
Thanks to the success of the Soviet Union’s Sputnik 1 satellite (described in 
Chapter 6) and Vostok 1 mission (see Chapter 7), as well as the United 
States’ Project Mercury (see Chapter 7), which had shown the world that 
both robotic and manned missions could orbit the Earth, the Space Race 
was becoming an all-out sprint. The Americans were clearly in second 
place in the early 1960s because the Soviets had more experience with 
space travel and possessed larger rockets. However, no country had yet 
won the ultimate prize of placing a human being on the Moon, and Dwight D. 
Eisenhower’s administration in the 1950s hadn’t put a heavy emphasis on 
this particular goal.
 
All that changed with the election of President John F. Kennedy in 1960. 
Although initially not a huge supporter of the space program, Kennedy seized 
the political and technological moment to initiate a program that would bring 
the nation together. In May 1961, in response to Yuri Gagarin’s successful 
space flight the previous month (and perhaps as an antidote to the recent 
Bay of Pigs debacle), Kennedy committed intellectual and financial resources 
to putting an American on the Moon before the end of the decade. At this 
point in time, the U.S. had only launched one astronaut, Alan Shepard, on a 
suborbital flight just a few weeks earlier! (See Chapter 7 for more details on 
Gagarin’s and Shepard’s flights.)
In an instantly famous speech made at Texas’s Rice University on September 
12, 1962, Kennedy both summarized his position on how he saw America 
fitting into the race to the Moon and justified the expenses and sacrifices 
involved:
“We choose to go to the Moon. We choose to go to the Moon in this 
decade and do the other things, not only because they are easy, but 
because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and 
measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one 
that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one 
which we intend to win, and the others, too.”

Kennedy’s goals for the American space program), check out www.jfk
library.org. Hold your mouse over the Historical Resources box and click 
on the JFK in History link. From there, simply click on the Space Program link.
Kennedy became one of the nation’s biggest supporters of the space program, 
and his job was, as he clearly recognized, not easy. A significant portion of the 
U.S. budget was devoted to Project Apollo, and Kennedy had to make 
the case for why such a vast expenditure was needed. In his 1962 address 
at Rice University, Kennedy reminded the audience, and the nation, of the 

121
 Chapter 9: Man on the Moon: Project Apollo
country’s position behind the Soviet Union in the Space Race. He painted a 
picture of American ingenuity and hard work and laid out a bold goal of 
sending astronauts to the Moon within just eight years.
NASA’s first task from the president: 
Coming up with an efficient flight design
The scientists and engineers at NASA had to figure out how to bring 
President Kennedy’s dreams to life. They started by designing a series of 
flights that would fulfill the president’s goal of landing a human on the 
Moon in such a short time period, while at the same time protecting their 
investment in both the astronauts and equipment. Several different strategic 
approaches for Project Apollo were introduced, but ultimately NASA officials 
determined that a lunar orbit rendezvous, or LOR, was the most-efficient way 
to land a person on the Moon quickly.
 
The basic concept behind a LOR involved modules, as you can see from this 
description of the mission’s three-part design (we include a diagram showing 
a typical mission to the Moon in Chapter 3):
 
1. A launch rocket would first hurl the spacecraft into space. After the 
spacecraft reached low Earth orbit, the rocket would reignite the third 
stage, sending the Lunar and Command/Service Modules on a trajectory 
that would reach the Moon a few days later.
 
2. Upon entering lunar orbit, two of the three crew members would enter 
the Lunar Module and detach it from the rest of the spacecraft before 
piloting it down to the Moon’s surface.
 
3. The remaining crew member would stay with the Command/Service 
Module in lunar orbit and wait for the lunar explorers to return by way 
of the Lunar Module’s ascent engine. After the Lunar Module arrived 
back safely, it would dock with the Command/Service Module. At this 
point, the crew members would jettison the Lunar Module and head 
back to Earth.
This ingenious mission design minimized the amount of rocket propellant 
required by only bringing along the parts of the spacecraft that were 
essential for each task.
 
The simplest mission concept to get to the Moon and back was the direct 
ascent, whereby a single spacecraft would be sent to the Moon and returned 
home in one piece. Although this method was initially the favored one, 
the size and weight of the required rocket boosters for both launches was 
ultimately prohibitive. Competing designs for a trip to the Moon included a 
lunar surface rendezvous, where two spacecraft (one manned, one unmanned) 
would launch into space, and the unmanned spacecraft would supply the 

122
Part II: The Great Space Race 
manned one with additional fuel to return home. Another plan, the Earth 
orbit rendezvous, would’ve launched two rockets, one with a lunar capsule 
and one with additional fuel and power for propulsion; the two halves 
would’ve docked in orbit before continuing on to the Moon. These latter 
two suggestions involved sending more weight into space than the LOR, in 
addition to requiring some potentially risky docking maneuvers.
The Components of an Apollo Mission
A typical Apollo mission had three major components, as shown in Figure 9-1:
 
✓ The Saturn V rocket
 
✓ The Command/Service Module
 
✓ The Lunar Module
This three-part division was one of the selling points of the lunar orbit 
rendezvous (LOR) method that we describe in the preceding section. 
It offered advantages in both weight and development time over other 
mission modes. The next few sections break down the details of the three 
Apollo components.

 Chapter 9: Man on the Moon: Project Apollo
The Saturn V rocket: Blasting 
off toward the Moon
Propelling a three-astronaut lunar spacecraft such as the Apollo into space 
required a powerful rocket. Fortunately, the Saturn V rocket was up to 
the task. This launch vehicle was a three-stage rocket in which each stage 
contained a different number of engines, had a different burn time, and 
supplied different amounts of thrust (the force necessary for an object to take 
flight, defy gravity, and move through space). The huge Saturn V rocket is 
still the largest rocket ever used successfully, both in terms of size and in 
how much payload (cargo) it could get into orbit.
 
The Stage 1 module of a three-stage rocket like the Saturn V is the most 
powerful and is required to lift the rocket and other modules off the ground 
and into orbit. When its propellant has been used up, it disengages from the 
rest of the rocket and burns up in the atmosphere. Stage 2 provides the 
second burn that raises the rocket higher; it also disconnects and burns up 
when its job is done. Stage 3 ends up in the same lunar transfer orbit as the 
Command/Service Module (CSM). After the Lunar Module is removed from 
the third stage, the CSM heads for the Moon, and the third stage moves on to 
a solar orbit. (See Chapter 3 for more on how rockets work.)
The Command/Service Module: 
Sustaining the mission
The Command/Service Module (CSM) of the Apollo spacecraft was a two-part 
entity that served to transport the astronauts, along with the Lunar Module, 
to the point where they could make their final lunar descent.
The CSM consisted of a Command Module plus a Service Module. The 
Command Module was designed to hold the crew plus their equipment; the 
Service Module contained the power supply, fuel, and storage. Because it 
housed the crew, the Command Module was intended to return home, 
whereas the Service Module was designed to be jettisoned and burned up in 
the atmosphere upon reentry. This design minimized the size of the capsule 
that had to be able to return safely to Earth, reducing mass and costs.
Smaller than you may’ve expected (see Figure 9-2), the Command Module 
measured just 127 inches (3.2 meters) by about 154 inches (3.9 meters). The 
Service Module was quite a bit larger — 295 inches (7.5 meters) long by 154 
inches (3.9 meters) wide at the base — because it had to hold enough power 
and propellant for both mission activities and the flight home.

Part II: The Great Space Race

The Command Module had a heat shield that was designed to partially 
burn off (ablate) as the capsule reentered the Earth’s atmosphere. Though 
temperatures at the surface of the capsule reached 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit 
(2,750 degrees Celsius), the crew was kept safe inside the fireball. The 
atmosphere slowed down the capsule, which then deployed three drogue 
parachutes to further reduce speeds for a safe ocean landing (otherwise 
known as a splashdown).
The Lunar Module: Designed to land
Perhaps the most-memorable component of the Apollo spacecraft, at least in 
the minds of everyone who saw it on television, the Lunar Module (also 
called the LEM, short for lunar excursion module) had just two purposes: land 
on the Moon and take the astronauts back to the Command/Service Module 
when their work was done. It was never intended to make it back to Earth by 
itself, and it could hold only two of the three Apollo crew members.
 
Designed in two stages (one for the ascent engine and one for the descent 
engine), the Lunar Module was a four-legged contraption that was actually one 
of the most-successful components of the entire Apollo program. Why? 
Because it was the only one to never fail in a way that compromised a mission.

125
 Chapter 9: Man on the Moon: Project Apollo
The ascent portion of the Lunar Module contained the crew-related stuff: 
cabin, life-support, instruments, hatches, and docking equipment. The 
descent portion housed the landing gear, a ladder from which the astronauts 
could conduct their moonwalks, and cargo areas for batteries and fuel stores. 
Both parts had engines, antennae, radar equipment, and fuel. The descent 
stage was left behind on the Moon, whereas the ascent stage returned the 
crew to the orbiting Command/Service Module. (Check out an image of the 
Lunar Module in Figure 9-3.)
 
The first Apollo flight to carry a Lunar Module was the Apollo 9 mission, 
and the first successful lunar landing occurred during the Apollo 11 mission 
(we cover both missions in detail later in this chapter). Although the Lunar 
Module may look spindly and unstable, remember it was designed to operate 
solely in the low-gravity environment of the Moon — it just didn’t need the 
reinforcements required for a similar vehicle on Earth, where the force of 
gravity is six times higher.

Laying the Groundwork for the 
Manned Apollo Missions
Making history is rarely a small affair. Project Apollo required significant 
resources, investments, and costs in order to reach its goals. Fortunately, 
all that time and money paid off: NASA made huge advances in the areas 
of computers and robotics as engineers worked to develop the first flight 

126
Part II: The Great Space Race 
computer to aid in navigation and implemented complicated automated 
flights to test various components of the Apollo spacecraft and Saturn V 
rocket without astronauts onboard.
 
NASA’s budget has expanded and shrunk over time, due in part to changes in 
emphasis on the space program. In the mid-1960s, the NASA budget rose to an 
all-time high, in no small part thanks to Project Apollo. Economists estimate 
that between 2 percent and 5 percent of every tax dollar went toward the 
space program during these years, and many employees (34,000 belonging to 
NASA plus more than 350,000 contractors) had the Apollo program to thank 
for their livelihood. No one ever said that putting a man on the Moon would 
come cheap. In total, about $25 billion in 1969 dollars was spent on Project 
Apollo (that’s about $135 billion in 2005 dollars!).
Developing the first flight computer
One important innovation of the Apollo missions was the first flight com-
puter, the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC). Designed by the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology in the early 1960s, the AGC allowed the astronauts to 
control the flight of their spacecraft and gather and interpret navigational 
data in real time. Although cutting-edge at the time, the AGC seems extremely 
basic today with its small display, numeric keyboard, and translation 
table that was necessary for interpreting the computer’s numerical codes 
output. It was the first computer to use integrated circuits (an early form of 
the microchips found in almost all of today’s electronic devices), and it had 
an extremely low amount of memory (just 36K of RAM).
 
The AGC led the way for the development of desktop calculators, and versions 
capable of performing advanced calculations became commercially available 
during the 1960s. By the mid-1970s, hand-held calculators with both scientific 
and programmable functions were available; one such calculator was actually 
tested aboard the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975 (see Chapter 12 for details on 
this mission).
Launching robotic flights: 
Apollo 4, 5, and 6
Although the manned flights are the ones that everyone thinks about when 
discussing Project Apollo, many robotic (unmanned) test flights went into 
making those landings possible. These missions laid the foundation for those 
important human flights and tested techniques that the astronauts would 
need to rely on later.

127
 Chapter 9: Man on the Moon: Project Apollo
The first flight tests involved full-scale mockups of the Command/Service and 
Lunar Modules. This approach allowed the real (and costly) capsules to be 
spared and the Saturn V rocket to be tested properly.
 
Here’s what the three robotic Apollo flights accomplished:
 
✓ The Apollo 4 flight was the first test of both the Saturn V rocket and the 
launch site (Launch Complex 39 at Florida’s Kennedy Space Center) 
built for it. It was designed to test the launch and reentry of the lunar 
spacecraft. The thrust of the rocket, around 7.5 million pounds, was 
enough to rock the NASA buildings that were close to four miles away! 
This unexpected effect led NASA engineers to design special techniques 
to dampen the shock waves, such as pumping ocean water onto the 
launch site.
 
✓ Apollo 5 provided an opportunity to test the Lunar Module. After 
reaching Earth orbit, the Lunar Module separated from the launch 
vehicle so that mission controllers could test both the descent and 
ascent propulsion systems under real space conditions. Despite 
a slight glitch that caused the descent propulsion system to shut down 
prematurely, the 11 hours of testing showed that all the systems on the 
Lunar Module worked successfully.
 
✓ Apollo 6, the last robotic mission of the series, was the “qualification 
flight” that certified the Saturn V rocket for active duty. It would’ve 
tested return entry scenarios for the Command/Service Module, but 
these tests were scrubbed due to engine problems. A range of other 
problems plagued this test flight, but fortunately these issues didn’t 
bode poorly for the future Apollo missions.
The missing Apollos?
What about Apollo 1, 2, and 3? No, these mis-
sions didn’t disappear into the dark side of the 
Moon. NASA began testing its Apollo space-
craft and Saturn launch vehicles with a differ-
ent numbering scheme. The first robotic flights 
took place as early as 1966, with the AS-201 
(Apollo/Saturn 201) flight, which tested a pre-
cursor Saturn 1 launch vehicle. AS-202, later in 
1966, was a reentry test of the Command/
Service Module, again on a Saturn 1 launch 
vehicle. AS-203, also in 1966, tested the Saturn 
IVB rocket. AS-204, in 1967, was scheduled to 
be the first manned flight, but the crew tragi-
cally perished in a fire during a prelaunch test 
(as you find out in Chapter 5). This mission was 
renamed Apollo 1 afterward in honor of the 
three astronauts who lost their lives. Missions 
then continued with the robotic AS-501 mission, 
which was renamed Apollo 4.

128
Part II: The Great Space Race 
Apollo 7-10: Preparing for the Moon 
with Manned Missions (1968–1969)
Readying the spacecraft, astronauts, and techniques for a Moon landing 
required significant preparatory work, which is where Apollo 7 through 
Apollo 10 came in. Each manned flight was designed to test certain elements 
of a Moon mission, all of which built on each other and ultimately led to the 
success of Apollo 11. The next few sections illustrate how these early 
manned Apollo missions made history in their own right.
Apollo 7: Testing the Command/Service 
Module (1968)
 
The significance of the first manned Apollo mission, Apollo 7, was simply that 
it succeeded. The purpose was to test the functioning of the Command/
Service Module, as well as the effectiveness of the newly designed flotation 
system for use during splashdown.
Because the Apollo 7 mission employed only the Command/Service Module 
(and not the Lunar Module), it launched with a smaller rocket, specifically 
the Saturn 1B. In addition to orbiting the Earth for a sustained period of time, 
this mission marked the first time a full three-member Apollo crew performed 
a mission in space. The crew members on this historic flight were 
Commander Walter Schirra, Command Module Pilot Donn Eisele, and Lunar 
Module Pilot Water Cunningham. Ironically, this same crew served as the 
backup for Apollo 1, a mission that proved deadly for all the astronauts 
aboard (see Chapter 5).
Fast facts about Apollo 7
Following are the basic facts about the 
Apollo 7 mission:
 ✓ Launch date and site: October 11, 1968; 
Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida
 ✓ Spacecraft name and mass at launch: 
Apollo CSM-101; 32,350 lb (14,674 kg)
 ✓ Launch vehicle: Saturn 1B
 ✓ Size of crew: 3 astronauts
 ✓ Number of Earth orbits: 163
 ✓ Mission duration: 10 days, 20 hours, 
9 minutes, 3 seconds

129
 Chapter 9: Man on the Moon: Project Apollo
Apollo 7 was definitely an endurance mission for the crew, which spent 
nearly 11 days in Earth orbit to make sure the spacecraft’s systems would 
operate long enough to get to the Moon and back. Unfortunately, the crew 
members weren’t all that comfortable during their trip — all three men 
developed colds near the beginning of the mission. Stuffy noses are bad 
enough on the ground, but in microgravity, there’s nothing to help all that 
mucus drain out of your sinuses. The discomfort made the crew fairly 
grumpy, and they resisted requests from Mission Control to add events to 
their timeline (which ended up causing the crew members to be passed over 
for future Apollo flights). The astronauts took a lot of decongestant tablets 
and spent a great deal of time blowing their noses to clear things out. As 
landing finally approached, one worry was that they wouldn’t be able to blow 
their noses while wearing pressure suits with helmets for reentry. If the sinus 
pressure grew too high, the astronauts risked rupturing their eardrums. 
Fortunately, decongestants helped them reach the ground safely!
Apollo 8: Orbiting the Moon (1968)
 
Apollo 8 earned its place in history as the first U.S. mission to orbit the Moon. 
Its core purpose was to see whether manned lunar orbit was possible, but it 
was also responsible for testing out the Saturn V, an enormous rocket that 
would be the launch vehicle of choice for many future missions. Apollo 8 also 
tested out the functioning of the Command/Service Module and its life-support 
systems and gathered Moon data, including photographs and information 
about the lunar landscape that directly benefitted later Apollo missions.
The Apollo 8 astronauts (Commander Frank Borman, Command Module Pilot 
James Lovell, and Lunar Module Pilot William Anders) had the honor of being 
the first humans to view the whole Earth from space, as well as from the 
Moon’s far side. As the spacecraft rounded the Moon for the fourth time, the

astronauts suddenly saw Earth come into view over the barren lunar surface. 
The image they captured (which we include in the color section) came to be 
an icon of both the Apollo missions, proving just how far they’d come, and 
the budding environmental movement, which adopted a view of Earth from 
space as a clear demonstration of how beautiful and fragile the planet 
appears. A live Christmas Eve television broadcast from Apollo 8 helped raise 
interest in the space program to even higher levels and paved the way for a 
successful Moon landing the following year.
Apollo 9: Docking in Earth orbit (1969)
 
Apollo 9 went down in space history as the first successful trial of a lunar 
orbit rendezvous, NASA’s chosen flight design for missions to the Moon 
(which we describe earlier in this chapter). The astronauts completed a 
successful separation, rendezvous, and docking of the Lunar and Command/
Service Modules in orbit around Earth, indicating that the ships were nearly 
ready for prime time.
The Apollo 9 crew (Commander Jim McDivitt, Command Module Pilot Dave 
Scott, and Lunar Module Pilot Rusty Schweickart) also executed a spacewalk 
(an extravehicular activity, or EVA, performed in space) to test the effective-
ness of the newly designed Apollo spacesuit. The suit carried its own life-
support system so that astronauts exploring the Moon’s surface wouldn’t 
have to be tethered to the spacecraft.

Apollo 10: Setting the stage for 
the first lunar landing (1969)
 
Any big production requires a dress rehearsal, and that’s precisely what 
Apollo 10 was. NASA considered this mission a dry run for Apollo 11 and so 
sent the complete Apollo spacecraft (Command/Service Module plus Lunar 
Module) and crew into space to test the Lunar Module in the environment for 
which it was really intended — lunar orbit. Commander Thomas Stafford, 
Command Module Pilot John Young, and Lunar Module Pilot Eugene Cernan 
crewed this particular flight and did everything that would be done during 
Apollo 11, with the exception of landing on the Moon.
Once in lunar orbit, the astronauts used thrusters to separate the Command/
Service and Lunar Modules. The Lunar Module was programmed to make 
low-orbit passes by the surface of the Moon, just as Apollo 11 would need to 
do; at its lowest altitude, the spacecraft was less than six miles away from 
the Moon’s surface. Numerous photos and television images of the Moon’s 
surface were taken from both modules. The astronauts ran a full test of the 
instrumentation and all equipment aboard the spacecraft, and they redocked 
successfully about eight hours after they first separated. Most of the tests 
went according to plan, and engineers felt confident that they were ready for 
the biggest test of all.
Although Apollo 10 accomplished its mission objectives, there were a few 
moments of peril when the Lunar Module went out of control while ascending 
from its closest approach to the Moon due to an incorrectly set switch. The 
spacecraft suffered huge gyrations, and the crew managed to get control 
back just two seconds before a crash landing would’ve been inevitable. The 
understandably coarse language used by the crew during this close call was 
amusingly referenced in a banner that greeted them upon their return; it read 
“The flight of Apollo 10 — for adult audiences only.”

Part II: The Great Space Race 
Apollo 11: Doing the Moonwalk (1969)
Despite numerous setbacks and intense competition from the Soviet Union, 
the United States won the most coveted accolade in the Space Race, if 
not the history of humanity, on July 20, 1969. On that day, Project Apollo 
placed an American on the surface of the Moon. The details that went into 
accomplishing this feat are no less remarkable than the results themselves.
Landing on the Moon
Apollo 11 was staffed by the typical crew of three astronauts. Neil Armstrong 
served as commander, Michael Collins piloted the Command Module (call 
sign “Columbia”), and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin piloted the Lunar Module (call 
sign “Eagle”). The spacecraft was launched using a Saturn V rocket, and the 
launch proceeded as planned. After first entering Earth orbit and then being 
rocketed into a lunar trajectory, the Command/Service Module separated 
from the third rocket stage and docked with the Lunar Module; this step 
was necessary because the Lunar Module was sent into space in the Lunar 
Module Adapter, a special structure on one of the rocket stages that helped 
protect the fragile Lunar Module during launch.
When the spacecraft entered lunar orbit, it headed for the anticipated 
landing site on the Moon’s Sea of Tranquility (see Chapter 8 for a diagram of 
the Moon’s regions). The Lunar Module undocked from the Command/
Service Module, leaving Collins alone in lunar orbit. Because large boulders 
covered the intended landing site, Armstrong and Aldrin had to manually 
keep the Lunar Module moving in order to find a smoother place to land. 
They eventually landed the spacecraft with little fuel left to spare. Soon 
afterward, Armstrong spoke the first words to be sent from the Moon: 
Snoopy and Charlie Brown in space
Although astronauts were perfectly capable of 
making names for themselves, sometimes the 
actual spacecraft needed a little help. The 
Apollo 10 mission found that help in the form of 
Charles Shultz, cartoonist of the immensely 
popular Peanuts strip, which was published in 
newspapers worldwide from 1952 to 1999.
Shultz left an indelible footprint in the form of 
books and comic strips, but he also impacted 
space exploration via the Apollo 10 mission. The 
Apollo crew members were allowed to assign 
nicknames to their spacecraft, and they chose 
Peanuts comic names for this particular flight. 
The Command/Service Module was dubbed 
“Charlie Brown,” and the Lunar Module earned 
the moniker “Snoopy.” Schultz then went on 
to create special Peanuts artwork for the 
mission.

 Chapter 9: Man on the Moon: Project Apollo
“Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.” After their landing 
was formally acknowledged (and celebrated!) on Earth, the astronauts 
prepared for their moonwalk (which is simply an extravehicular activity [EVA] 
done on the Moon).
“One giant leap for mankind”
After a quick meal on the Moon, Armstrong and Aldrin prepared to take their 
first steps on the lunar surface. Neil Armstrong exited the Lunar Module first, 
descended the nine steps of the exit ladder, took that first historic step on 
the Moon, and uttered the words America longed to hear: “That’s one small 
step for man, one giant leap for mankind.”
 
Technically, Armstrong should’ve included the article “a” to make his line 
“That’s one small step for a man . . .,” but in the excitement of landing on the 
Moon, grammar mistakes likely weren’t the first thing on his mind!
These first steps occurred about six and a half hours after the Lunar Module 
landed on the Moon. Aldrin soon followed Armstrong, and the two astronauts 
spent the next several hours photographing, drilling into the lunar surface 
for samples, and taking careful notes on everything around them. They 
photographed the soil, their own footsteps, and the Lunar Module itself; the 
latter photographs eventually helped NASA engineers evaluate both the 
spacecraft and its landing orientation.
An external television camera broadcast the astronauts’ historic steps via 
live TV. The images were somewhat degraded because they had to pass 
through a second television monitor before being transmitted to radio 
telescopes on Earth, but they were good enough for people around the world 
to feel like they were really witnessing history (see Figure 9-4).

Working and walking in Moon dust
 
The Americans’ lunar landing wasn’t just about beating the Soviets; it was also 
about testing the effects of the Moon’s low gravity on motion and harvesting 
soil and rock samples to bring back to Earth. The astronauts tested a variety 
of motions on the Moon. They walked and hopped to demonstrate how they 
were able to balance, particularly while wearing their bulky spacesuits, in the 
Moon’s low gravity. Both Aldrin and Armstrong adopted a sort of long-strided 
glide as the most-efficient way to move, and both noted that they needed 
to anticipate their movements because the Moon’s surface dust was more 
slippery than anticipated. (You can check out an image of Aldrin walking on 
the Moon in the color section.)
The lunar dust was also quite abundant. It flew up as Aldrin and Armstrong 
walked about and gathered 47 pounds of lunar soil and rocks through 
collection tubes and core samples. The tubes had to be hammered into the 
Moon’s surface, which was no small feat while wearing a bulky spacesuit and 
gloves. Other samples were taken using long-handled shovels.
The sampling and other work took longer than expected, which meant the 
astronauts wound up doing less sampling than originally planned. Mission 
Control back on Earth carefully monitored the astronauts’ core temperatures 
and other physiological factors and let the men know when they were 
working too hard so they could reserve enough energy to make it back into 
the Lunar Module for the return journey.

 Chapter 9: Man on the Moon: Project Apollo
Planting the flag and heading home
In the ultimate display of American pride, Armstrong and Aldrin planted a 
United States flag into the lunar surface. Because there’s no wind on the 
Moon to blow out the flag, the astronauts mounted it to a small rod that 
would (in theory) help keep the flag extended on the pole. In reality, the rod 
failed to extend all the way, giving the flag a slightly rumpled look that lends 
the appearance of fluttering (a look that was intentionally emulated on future 
Moon landings; see Figure 9-5). The astronauts also spoke via radio to 
President Richard Nixon during what was perhaps the most memorable (and 
probably expensive) telephone call to have been made from the White House. 
They also left behind a plaque, drawings of Earth, an olive branch, and other 
terrestrial memorabilia.
When it was time to head back, Aldrin reentered the Lunar Module first, 
followed by Armstrong. Along with them came camera film and boxes full 
of rock and soil samples. The astronauts disconnected themselves from 
their spacesuit life-support systems and hooked into the Lunar Module’s 
life-support system instead. In an effort to make the Lunar Module lighter for 
the return trip, they jettisoned their life-support backpacks, parts of their 
spacesuits, and anything else that could be spared. The Lunar Module was 
repressurized for the return trip while the astronauts slept. After a quick 
repair to a circuit breaker, the ascent engine was fired, and the spacecraft 
returned to lunar orbit, leaving the descent stage behind on the lunar 
surface. Its rendezvous with the Command/Service Module was a success, 
and the ascent portion of the Lunar Module was jettisoned as planned.

The astronauts completed their mission, splashing down into the Pacific 
Ocean within five miles of the USS Hornet, their homeward-bound recovery 
ship. They were all quarantined for a period of time but were released 
within a few weeks after scientists realized they hadn’t contracted any 
special lunar diseases. From then on the newly minted worldwide celebrities 
were free to engage in parades, publicity tours, and other celebrations of 
their achievement.

W
ith the incredible success of Apollo 11 (covered in Chapter 9), the 
U.S. space program had the support it needed to continue with the 
rest of the intended Apollo missions. Although putting the first man on the 
Moon in 1969 was an unparalleled achievement, other surprises were yet to 
come from the astronauts and their missions. After the frenzied pace lead-
ing up to Apollo 11, NASA was able to step back and space out the missions 
more, both to save money and to allow time for innovations and lessons 
learned from previous missions. As a result, the missions following Apollo 11 
were rich in scientific exploration, as you discover in this chapter.
 
The news post–Apollo 11 wasn’t all good, however. Project Apollo represented 
a huge investment of American resources, both in terms of funding and brain-
power. Although the country certainly reaped tangible benefits in the form of 
spinoff technology and the creation of new technical industries, much of the 
driving force supporting this vast expenditure evaporated after the political 
goal of landing on the Moon first was accomplished. Science, always in second 
place to political reality, was allowed a few experiments in between flag plant-
ings and live television broadcasts, but the political triumph of the Moon land-
ings was always clear. Because the goal was “land on the Moon” rather than 
“do science on the Moon,” after the initial Moon landings were accomplished, 
there was little reason to go back. Support for the Apollo program dried up, 
and the planned missions after Apollo 17 were canceled. Still, as NASA has dis-
covered with the Space Shuttle program, there’s only so much you can do in 
Earth orbit. NASA once again plans to return astronauts to the Moon for both 
political and scientific reasons.

Part II: The Great Space Race 
Apollo 12: Achieving A Second 
Successful Lunar Landing (1969)
Apollo 11 was a hard act to follow — after all, it put the first men on the 
Moon — but the Apollo 12 mission proved it was up to the task. Not only did 
the Americans put another pair of men on the Moon, but they did so just four 
months after their first successful attempt. This time the astronauts were to 
explore a different part of the Moon: the Oceanus Procellarum, a vast lunar 
plain that borders the near side of the Moon and was found to be covered 
with ancient lava flows. (Apollo 11 landed several miles west of the Sea of 
Tranquility, an area with varied topography that results from the close quar-
ters of several other basins.)
Apollo 12 was led by Commander Charles Conrad. Richard Gordon piloted 
the Command/Service Module, and Alan Bean piloted the Lunar Module. Like 
its predecessor, the mission launched from a Saturn V rocket and followed 
the standard lunar orbit rendezvous flight design (described in Chapter 9) 
that called for the Lunar Module to detach from the Command/Service 
Module upon entering the Moon’s atmosphere.
 
The Apollo 11 Lunar Module missed its mark due to geologic conditions, 
but Apollo 12 landed right on target, only about 600 feet away from the goal 
(which was, not coincidentally, near the site of the Surveyor 3 mission that 
we describe in Chapter 8). Because of this accurate landing, Conrad and Bean 
were able to take extensive photographs of the landing area. These images 
proved useful in planning the landing areas of later missions in high terrain 
areas.
Based on the experience of the first lunar astronauts, the Apollo 12 astro-
nauts were better able to budget their time to tackle all of their assignments 
before the clock ran out. Two moonwalks (officially known as extravehicular 
activities, or EVAs, done on the Moon’s surface) were conducted as part of 
the lunar mission:
 
✓ The first moonwalk, broadcast in real time from a television camera 
mounted on the Lunar Module, involved the astronauts collecting soil 
samples and setting up an experiment to test the composition of noble 
gases in the solar wind.
 
✓ The second moonwalk undertook a geologic traverse. In non–NASA 
speak, that’s a long (4,300-foot [1,310-meter] to be exact) moonwalk with 
a designated scientific purpose. During this trek, Conrad and Bean col-
lected several different Moon soil and rock samples that were brought 
to Earth for analysis.

139
 Chapter 10: Continued Lunar Exploration after Apollo 11
 
As part of its mission, Apollo 12 made a visit to the site of the Surveyor 3 
spacecraft. The Apollo 12 astronauts were able to bring several pieces of it 
back home, including the TV camera. The parts’ main research value for scien-
tists back on Earth was that they showed how metal and other elements were 
preserved after sitting on the Moon’s surface for two and a half years. Initially, 
scientists also thought that a strain of terrestrial bacteria had survived the 
long exposure on the lunar surface, but more recently, experts think that the 
bacteria came from contamination back on Earth after the camera was 
retrieved. We include an image of the Apollo 12 astronauts visiting Surveyor 3 
in Chapter 8.
Apollo 14: Making Up for 
Lost Research (1971)
Thanks to the failure of Apollo 13 to land on the Moon (as explained in Chapter 
5), the next Apollo mission was under huge amounts of pressure to pick up the 
research and sample collection slack. With a few design changes, Apollo 14 ful-
filled its new goals admirably and was able to take a wealth of photos, gather 
numerous samples, and conduct several interesting experiments.
Crewed by Commander Alan Shepard, Command Module Pilot Stuart Roosa, 
and Lunar Module Pilot Edgar Mitchell, the spacecraft launched from the 
now-standard Saturn V rocket on January 31, 1971. Despite a few noncriti-
cal glitches with the docking equipment, the Lunar Module landed in the Fra 
Mauro Formation, which had been the intended landing site for Apollo 13. 
Shepard and Mitchell descended to the Moon’s surface and took numerous 
photographs of the landing site, the moonwalks, and all experiments.

140
Part II: The Great Space Race 
 
Two moonwalks were included on the Apollo 14 agenda; together, they totaled 
more than nine hours of time working outside the Lunar Module. Shepard and 
Mitchell collected rock and soil samples from 13 different sites near the Lunar 
Module, and they performed a number of experiments, including meteoroid 
experiments, microgravity analysis, and the transfer of liquids in microgravity. 
The material at the Fra Mauro Formation was particularly interesting because 
it was created as a result of a series of large meteor impacts. The rocks had 
been broken down into smaller pieces with each impact, and in many cases, 
new rocks were actually formed from the heat generated by the impacts. The 
impacts excavated craters, which brought up rocks from deep beneath the 
surface; the astronauts collected samples from such boulders. The resulting 
information opened up an entirely new field of lunar geologic research.
One of several innovations aboard Apollo 14 was the MET, or modular equip-
ment transporter (see Figure 10-1). This two-wheeled cart not only allowed the 
astronauts to transport equipment (such as tools and cameras) but it also let 
them carry back more rock samples than they could’ve transported manu-
ally. With the help of the MET, Shepard and Mitchell were able to bring back 
the largest amount of Moon rocks yet — about 93 pounds (42 kilograms) 
worth.

Playing golf on the Moon
Although Apollo 14 landed on the Moon well 
before Tiger Woods became a fixture in the 
professional golf world, one of the mission’s 
most-famous moments was a hole in one. Each 
astronaut participating in the Apollo 14 mis-
sion was allowed to bring along a few personal 
items. Stuart Roosa chose to bring tree seeds 
(later germinated and planted around the U.S. 
as Apollo Moon trees), whereas Alan Shepard 
brought two golf balls.
A full golf club wasn’t sanctioned for the trip, but 
being an astronaut and an innovator, Shepard 
made do with one of his rod-shaped metal geo-
logic tool handles and attached a golf club head 
to one end. During a moonwalk, he swung for 
two separate shots on the surface of the Moon. 
The balls traveled a good distance — about 
590 and 820 feet (180 and 250 meters). Gravity 
on the Moon is considerably lower than that on 
Earth, and Shepard was put at a disadvantage 
by having to swing in his spacesuit. A short 
time afterward, Mitchell threw an instrument 
pole javelin-style, which traveled almost as far 
as Shepard’s first golf shot.

Part II: The Great Space Race 
Apollo 15: Testing the Limits 
of Lunar Exploration (1971)
 
After the U.S. proved that landing and walking on the Moon was possible, it 
decided to raise the bar for future Apollo missions, beginning with Apollo 15. 
Because it was rapidly becoming clear that the immense cost of lunar explo-
ration couldn’t be sustained for long, it was imperative that Apollo 15 and 
later missions do as much science as they could. NASA officials pumped up 
the goals for Apollo 15 (as well as Apollo 16 and 17) to test the limits of lunar 
exploration as the world knew them. Earlier Apollo missions were limited in 
terms of the type of terrain they could land on, the amount of lunar samples 
they could bring back, and the length of time they could work on the Moon’s 
surface. Apollo 15 was charged with breaking those limitations in part by trav-
eling farther away from the lunar landing site and bringing more equipment 
for conducting experiments and gathering data.
Toward this end, changes to the equipment setup were made before Apollo 
15; one of the most important was the inclusion of a new scientific instrument 
module. The Lunar Module was also redesigned to allow for greater payloads 
(cargo; in this case, primarily lunar rocks and soil samples) and to provide 
the astronauts with the tools they needed to survive for longer periods of 
time on the surface. Perhaps the best-known innovation of Apollo 15, though, 
was the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), a four-wheeled vehicle that helped the 
astronauts collect samples on the Moon (see Figure 10-2).
 
Apollo 15, 16, and 17 were dubbed the J missions, the culmination of an 
alphabetic series of missions that began with unmanned tests of the various 
Apollo modules (A and B missions); manned tests in Earth orbit (C, D, and E); 
a manned test in lunar orbit (F); and a manned lunar landing (G, which was 
Apollo 11). H-series missions included two moonwalks (Apollo 12 and 14), and 
J missions included a three-day stay on the surface of the Moon and the use of 
the LRV.
The Apollo 15 mission was crewed by Commander David Scott, Command 
Module Pilot Alfred Worden, and Lunar Module Pilot James Irwin. These 
astronauts had to be trained differently than their predecessors due to the 
more-aggressive nature of their terrain hikes on the Moon; they spent more 
time hiking outdoors in their spacesuits, and of course had to undergo a 
series of training activities with the new LRV.
 
While Scott and Irwin went down to the Moon for their part of the mission, 
Worden remained in the Command/Service Module and conducted a series 
of experiments. He used special equipment to study the Moon’s surface from 
afar, and he took highly detailed panoramic photos. His other work included 
using a gamma ray spectrometer, mass altimeter, and other devices to help 
create a more-sophisticated map of the Moon’s surface.

Landing on the rugged terrain 
of the Hadley-Apennine region
Previous Apollo landings had the luxury of landing on lunar maria, the flat, 
dark, volcanic plains that cover much of the near side of the Moon. Apollo 
15 took a more rugged approach: It landed in the Hadley-Apennine region 
of the Moon, a landing site chosen partially for its varied terrain. Hadley-
Apennine lay along the Imbrium Basin, and scientists believed valuable infor-
mation could be gleaned from any samples taken along the basin’s rim. They 
expected that the astronauts would be able to obtain samples here that had 
come from deeper within the Moon than they had in the Fra Mauro Formation 
(the Apollo 14 landing site). In addition, they thought that landing in Hadley-
Apennine would allow the astronauts to get an up-close view of the Hadley 
Rille, a region that was suspected to be the site of former volcanic activity.
The Hadley-Apennine site proved to be a fruitful, and beautiful, landing site, 
with mountains and valleys rather than the flat plains of earlier missions. 
The varied terrain allowed the crew to collect samples from a wide variety 
of geologic features, including what had been dubbed the “Holy Grail” of the 
remaining lunar science objectives: the collection of a piece of ancient lunar 
crust.

Part II: The Great Space Race 
Driving the first Lunar Roving Vehicle
 
Apollo 15 couldn’t just return with some Moon rocks and dust. That was old 
news. It had to come back to Earth with more lunar souvenirs than any of 
its predecessors. Enter the Lunar Roving Vehicle, or LRV (nicknamed “Moon 
Buggy”). The LRV was an electric, four-wheeled vehicle designed specifically 
to run in the Moon’s low-gravity environment. Here were some of its key 
characteristics:
 
✓ Rugged enough to handle being driven over a range of terrain types
 
✓ Enough storage space to be able to carry back the astronauts’ antici-
pated payload and then some
 
✓ Able to be folded up during flight
 
✓ Equipped with two aluminum seats, one for the mission commander and 
one for the pilot of the Lunar Module
 
✓ Armed with cameras and antennae to provide the world with a live 
broadcast of the astronauts’ travels and research
During the journey to the Moon, the LRV had been folded compactly and 
stored in the descent-stage portion of the Lunar Module (for more detail on 
this and other parts of the Apollo spacecraft, see Chapter 9). After landing, 
the astronauts busted out pulleys, tapes, and reels to lower the LRV down 
to the Moon’s surface so they could unfold it and prepare it for use. 
Fortunately, the folding components were designed to lock as they were 
opened, so Scott and Irwin didn’t have to attempt any finely detailed assem-
bly work with their gloved hands.

Changes to the spacesuit gave the astronauts increased flexibility, particularly 
around the hips and waist. Being able to bend over more fully, something that 
hadn’t been possible with the previous Apollo spacesuits, allowed them to sit 
down and ride in the LRV. This was, of course, critical to their being able to 
use it!
The astronauts found that the LRV’s four-wheel-drive allowed them to 
maneuver over the surface of the Moon without too much trouble. The ride 
was quite bumpy though, so they were very glad to have seat belts. With the 
help of the LRV, Scott and Irwin were able to bring home about 170 pounds 
(76 kilograms) worth of lunar rocks and soil, including the Genesis Rock, an 
almost unaltered 4-billion-year-old sample of the lunar crust — the very type 
of rock mission designers had been hoping to find! The LRV traveled a total 
of about 17 miles (28 kilometers), stopping 12 times along the way to collect 
rock and soil samples.
Embracing new life-support systems 
for extended space work
The longer surface missions NASA wanted to run weren’t possible without 
enhanced life-support systems, so the Apollo 15 astronauts got to test out 
the changes NASA engineers had made, such as the extra batteries and 
other life-support necessities added to the Lunar Module in order to allow 
the astronauts to make extended moonwalks. In addition to the life-support 
Gravity: It’s the law
In the days before Isaac Newton formulated 
the mathematical basis for gravity, Galileo 
Galilei performed a series of experiments into 
how gravity worked. His research showed 
that objects fall at a constant acceleration 
that’s independent of the mass of the object. 
One story, probably a made-up one, says that 
Galileo tested this theory by dropping cannon-
balls of the same size but different weights from 
the Leaning Tower of Pisa and observing that 
they hit the ground at the same time. Other fac-
tors such as air resistance and friction come 
into play on the Earth, meaning that the surface 
area of a falling object can change the speed 
at which it falls. For example, a feather floats 
slowly to the ground, whereas a rock falls 
quickly.
Because the Moon has no atmosphere, there’s 
no air to slow down falling objects, making it 
a perfect place to test Galileo’s theory. During 
the Apollo 15 mission, Commander David Scott 
brought a falcon feather (in honor of the Lunar 
Module’s “Falcon” call sign) and a hammer. He 
proceeded to drop them both at the same time 
while on live television. Sure enough, account-
ing for slight differences in Scott’s right- and left-
hand synchronization, the two objects struck 
the Moon’s surface simultaneously. Physicists 
everywhere breathed a sigh of relief!

system on the Lunar Module, the astronauts’ spacesuits had been modified 
with improvements to the Portable Life-Support System. These enhance-
ments allowed them to stay outside the Lunar Module for additional time. 
Unlike other Apollo missions, Scott and Irwin were able to complete three 
moonwalks during Apollo 15; that added up to about 18 hours of EVA time on 
the Moon’s surface.
Altogether, the improvements to the life-support systems allowed Scott and 
Irwin to spend about 67 hours on the Moon’s surface — more than twice the 
amount of time previous Apollo astronauts were able to devote. In between 
excursions in the LRV, the astronauts returned to the Lunar Module to per-
form additional scientific experiments, which included using a lunar surface 
drill to gather samples and place underground probes, as well as deploying 
the now-standard experiment for testing solar wind composition.
Scott and Irwin performed other tests on lunar soil and planted an American 
flag at their landing site. Before leaving the Moon’s surface, they made sure 
to place the LRV’s camera in a position that would allow it to broadcast a 
video of the Lunar Module’s ascent back into orbit. (The LRV was never 
intended to make the flight back to Earth.)
Apollo 16: Breaking Records (1972)
Apollo 16 was like the bigger, better version of Apollo 15. It may have been 
the tenth manned Apollo mission and the fifth lunar-landing mission, but 
it was the first one to land in the lunar highlands. Second in the J-series of 
missions (defined by their ability to bring home larger payloads, run more 
experiments on the Moon, and use the Lunar Roving Vehicle [LRV] that we 
describe earlier in this chapter), Apollo 16 also trumped the payload and 
lunar surface time records of its immediate predecessor.
The crew of Apollo 16 consisted of Commander John Young, Command 
Module Pilot Ken Mattingly, and Lunar Module Pilot Charles Duke, Jr. Oddly 
enough, all three astronauts had a connection to Apollo 13: Young and Duke 
were part of the mission’s backup crew, and Mattingly was actually slated to 
pilot the Command/Service Module until he was exposed to German measles 
and had to be removed from the flight rotation.
 
Apollo 16’s Lunar Module landed on the edge of the Moon’s Descartes 
Mountain range, marking the first time that an Apollo mission succeeded in 
landing in the ancient lunar highlands. Consequently, the astronauts and their 
trusty LRV were able to explore a brand-new type of geology and learn about 
the composition of the highlands. To maximize the geologic potential of the 
mission, the target landing site was set between two impact craters: South Ray 
and North Ray Craters. (In Figure 10-3, Duke is standing at the edge of Plum 
Crater at the landing site.)

148
Part II: The Great Space Race 
Apollo 16 managed to break the lunar surface record set by Apollo 15; the 
astronauts spent a total of 71 hours on the Moon. They traveled via the LRV 
about 17 miles (27 kilometers), roughly the same distance the Apollo 15 crew 
traveled, but they brought home more samples — 212 pounds (96 kilograms) 
worth to be exact — and stayed on the Moon’s surface about two hours 
longer. Two additional hours may not seem like a lot, but many incremental 
improvements in spacesuit and life-support technology were required to 
make ’em possible.
Young and Duke conducted three moonwalks during their 71 hours on the 
Moon’s surface, getting in about 20 hours of EVA time. After deploying the 
LRV and establishing a television broadcast, the astronauts set off on their 
geologic traverses (a long moonwalk with a dedicated scientific purpose, such 
as gathering samples or taking pictures). They also did what was becoming 
routine for lunar astronauts: deploying experiments packages, setting up a 
cosmic ray detector, digging for soil samples, and planting an American flag 
(see the color section for an image of Young jumping to salute the flag). Some 
of their experiments involved
 
✓ Testing the properties of Moon soil
 
✓ Collecting solar wind samples through the solar wind composition 
experiment
 
✓ Measuring cosmic rays with a cosmic ray detector
 
✓ Taking ultraviolet pictures using the Far Ultraviolet Camera/
Spectrograph, which allowed astronauts to take pictures of the stars at 
wavelengths that aren’t available on Earth
 
Apollo 16’s experiments led to an important discovery about the lunar high-
lands, ancient battered regions of the Moon that look bright when seen from 
Earth. (The lunar maria are the other main geologic feature on the Moon; they 
look smooth and dark from Earth.) Based on Duke and Young’s discovery of 
breccias, mixed-up rocks formed by impact rather than volcanic activity, in 
the Descartes region, scientists determined that the highlands were predomi-
nantly the result of impact cratering rather than volcanic activity. Whereas 
the dark lunar maria are thought to be ancient lava flows, even those surfaces 
have been battered by impacting objects from space, such as pieces of aster-
oids and comets. Because the Moon lacks an atmosphere to protect it from 
small meteors and has no wind or water to erode its surface, the lunar surface 
bears almost a perfect record of the many bits of material that have hit it, 
from tiny micrometeorites that mix up the soil to larger bodies that form big 
craters.

Apollo 17: Presenting Project Apollo’s 
Grand Finale (1972)
 
The last manned Moon landing of the Apollo program was Apollo 17, a mission 
that was designed to maximize the number of lunar samples collected and 
experiments run. Why? Because mankind was making its last journey to the 
Moon for the remainder of the 20th century. All future Apollo missions had 
been canceled due to a combination of budgetary concerns and a need to allo-
cate resources to other projects. The equipment originally slated for Apollo 
18, 19, and 20 was used for other missions, put on display, or scrapped.
Unlike the previous Apollo flights, Apollo 17 launched at night (see Figure 
10-4). A failure in the countdown sequencer caused a slight delay, but after a 
few hours, the flight launched as planned. The spacecraft itself was similar to 
the previous Apollo spacecraft, with the exception of several small changes 
intended to correct minor problems noticed on Apollo 16.

Part II: The Great Space Race 
As with the earlier Apollo flights, the Command/Service Module (CSM) and 
Lunar Module launched together with the aid of the Saturn V rocket and then 
separated once in orbit. Commander Eugene Cernan and Lunar Module Pilot 
Harrison Schmitt descended to the lunar surface, and Command Module Pilot 
Ronald Evans stayed aboard the CSM to conduct experiments from space.
Traveling around varied terrain
The landing site for Apollo 17 was the subject of some debate. NASA scien-
tists wanted to be sure they chose wisely because it wasn’t like they were 
going to get another chance. Some sites of interest, such as the Tycho Crater 
or the Tsiolkovsky Crater, were rejected because they presented too danger-
ous a landing site and would’ve required communications satellites due to 
their location. Other promising sites, such as the Mare Crisium highlands, 
were turned down because they were more accessible to Soviet spacecraft 
than American ones.
The ultimate selection was on the rim of the Mare Serenitatis. This area, 
known as the Taurus-Littrow region, provided a range of terrain types from 
which the astronauts could take samples, including mountains, boulders, 
older highlands, younger volcanic regions, and impact craters. It certainly 
didn’t hurt that previous Apollo astronauts had spotted odd craters with 
dark haloes surrounding them, which some scientists thought could be volca-
nic. One such crater, Shorty, was an important target for the Apollo 17 crew.
Like its predecessors, Apollo 15 and 16, Apollo 17 made use of a Lunar Roving 
Vehicle (LRV) to increase the astronauts’ ability to travel across the Moon’s 
surface and collect heavy samples. Cernan and Schmitt deployed and tested 
the LRV, making sure the attached television camera was working so the 
vehicle could broadcast their work live back on Earth.
Together they gathered more than 700 samples taken with two main goals in 
mind: Scientists wanted examples of ancient highlands rocks, as well as sam-
ples of newer volcanic material. Some of the samples the astronauts brought 
back included the following:
 
✓ The volcanic samples taken from the Taurus-Littrow Valley floor were 
shown to be primarily made of mare basalt, which is created from 
molten lava.
 
✓ Lunar highland rock samples (much older than the more-recent mare 
basalt) were found in the mountains on either side of the landing area, and 
they helped show that the meteorite impact that created the Serenitatis 
basin was close to 4 billion years old. These 4.2- to 4.5-billion-year-old 
rocks were brought closer to the surface as a result of the impact.
 
✓ One particularly interesting sample was orange, glassy soil found near 
the dark-haloed crater Shorty, which turned out to be from an ancient 
volcanic eruption that was stirred up by the impact.

151
 Chapter 10: Continued Lunar Exploration after Apollo 11
 
Over the course of three moonwalks, which lasted a total of approximately 22 
hours, Cernan and Schmitt collected more than 243 pounds (110 kilograms) of 
lunar soil and rock samples. They were also involved in the solar system’s first 
lunar fender bender, which occurred when the right rear fender fell off the 
LRV. The cause wasn’t one of the left-behind LRVs from previous missions but 
rather an errant tool. The astronauts were able to make repairs using the 
objects they had available, and the moon rides proceeded without further 
problems.
Not one of the Apollo missions was long enough for any sort of in-depth 
geologic exploration, but they did greatly enhance scientists’ understand-
ing of the formation and history of the Moon. More importantly, the samples 
returned from known locations on the lunar surface could be backdated in 
Earth-based labs. This information was used to build up a chronology that 
has allowed estimates of surface ages to be made for the other planets in our 
solar system.
Setting up complex science experiments
Because Apollo 17 was the last chance NASA scientists had to harvest sci-
entific data from the Moon, they prepared a battery of complex experiments 
for the astronauts to perform. (The expanded experiments package actually 
caused Apollo 17’s initial geologic traverse to be shorter than anticipated.) 
The experiments package included studies of subsurface gravity, heat flow, 
and seismic data. The purpose of these experiments was to discover more 
about lunar surface material, as well as what was going on deep underneath 
the Moon’s surface. The setup for these deep experiments was more complex 
because additional skill and precision were necessary to drill for soil and 
rock samples. Apollo 17 had just the man for the job in the form of Schmitt.
An American geologist as well as an astronaut, Schmitt joined NASA in 1965 as 
part of an effort to involve geologists more in the space program. He worked 
directly with other astronauts to provide training for geologic field work that 
would be done on the Moon. When it became apparent that Apollo 17 would 
end the United States’ forays to the Moon, Schmitt was selected for the final 
mission. As a trained field geologist, he was able to select rock samples with 
an educated eye (bringing home a treasure trove for geologists) and provide 
expert assistance with the complex experiments that needed to be run.
The Apollo 17 results showed, again, no evidence for recent volcanic activ-
ity on the Moon. Even the orange, glassy soil found near the Shorty crater 
turned out to have come from an ancient, long-buried volcanic deposit that 
was simply exposed by the more-recent impact that formed the crater.
 
The last human steps on the Moon were taken by Eugene Cernan on December 
14, 1972. File that away for the next time you play Trivial Pursuit.

Part II: The Great Space Race 
Scoping Out the Soviets’ Lunar 
Exploration Preparations
Although the Soviet Union began the Space Race in the 1950s with a substan-
tial lead, the U.S. gained a triumphant victory when it landed astronauts on 
the Moon in the 1960s and 1970s. The Soviets worked hard to compete with 
Project Apollo’s successes, but the lunar program they devised was marred 
by accidents that slowed progress to such a point that they had no hope of 
catching up. President John F. Kennedy offered to perform joint Moon mis-
sions with the Soviet Union, but the Soviets mistrusted the American pro-
posal. Instead, they worked on their own lunar exploration preparations. Yet 
ultimately, cosmonauts were excluded from lunar exploration and the exclu-
sive club of moonwalkers.
 
Because the Soviets’ lunar program was primarily politically motivated (much 
like its American counterpart; see Chapter 9 for details), after the political 
impetus to be “first” was no longer present, the Soviet lunar cosmonaut pro-
gram collapsed. Instead, the nation quickly switched its political, and scien-
tific, space goals to building space stations in orbit around the Earth, which it 
accomplished successfully in 1971 (see Chapter 12 for details).
Preparing the N1 rocket
The N1 rocket was the Soviet Union’s version of the Saturn V rocket (the 
launch vehicle of choice for each manned Apollo mission; see Chapters 3 
and 9 for the scoop on the Saturn V). Development on the N1 began in 1959.

have other military implications as well, the N1 (which you can see in Figure 
10-5) was a five-stage rocket with a hefty mass of 6,029,643 pounds (2,735,000 
kilograms). Measuring about 345 feet (105 meters) in height with a 56-foot 
(17-meter) diameter, it was hardly a small rocket. In fact, it was only slightly 
smaller than the Saturn V.

Although the N1 design was a powerful one, it didn’t have unanimous support 
from Soviet rocket designers. Each of the major players at the time supported 
a different proposal. By 1961, the N1 project received only minimal funding, 
yet it was still slated for a test launch in 1965. Due to various political mishaps, 
technical difficulties, and the death of the N1’s primary supporter, Sergei 
Korolev, the project never succeeded in its stated mission. Four attempts to 
launch the N1 occurred from 1969 through 1971, but they all ended in disaster.
Building the LK lunar lander
In the event that a suitable rocket was developed, Soviet space designers 
did have a plan for sending cosmonauts to the Moon. Their 1964 design 
coalesced into the LK lunar lander, a single-crew spacecraft that, the Soviets 
hoped, would provide for a Moon landing before the Americans had a chance 
to win with Project Apollo (see Figure 10-6 for a comparison of the LK with 
the American Lunar Module).

The LK differed from the American Lunar Module in several ways:
 
✓ Because the N1 rocket had a smaller payload (cargo) capacity than the 
Saturn V, the LK was smaller and lighter and could hold only one 
cosmonaut.
 
✓ There wasn’t room for a docking tunnel or bay to connect the LK to its 
counterpart orbiter, so the cosmonaut would’ve had to do a spacewalk 
(an extravehicular activity, or EVA, performed in space) from one space-
craft to the other.
 
✓ The ascent and descent mechanisms were also handled differently. The 
Soviet LK used a single stage rocket for both landing on the lunar sur-
face and lifting off of it, whereas NASA’s Lunar Module used a separate 
landing stage and ascent stage.
Like Project Apollo’s Lunar Module, though, the LK was based on a modular 
design. It had landing gear for a touchdown on the Moon, a rocket stage to 
provide for a soft lunar landing as well as liftoff back into orbit, a pressur-
ized cabin module for the cosmonaut, and thrusters to keep the spacecraft 
oriented properly. It also contained flight controls, life-support systems, a 
power supply, and all the other essentials required for a Moon landing.
 
Unlike the N1, the LK program was considered quite successful. The lander 
was test-flown in low Earth orbit several times under the Cosmos 379, Cosmos 
398, and Cosmos 434 missions. However, without a launch vehicle capable of 
carrying it into lunar orbit, the LK had nowhere to go. As a result, the Soviet 
lander never made it to the Moon.

A
t the same time as the successes of the United States’ Project Apollo, 
which ultimately sent astronauts to the Moon (see Chapters 9 and 10) 
were mounting, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union developed a large suite of 
robotic space probes that traveled to other planets. The Soviets had a series 
of failed missions to Mars, but the Americans sent missions that successfully 
flew past, orbited, and eventually landed on Mars. The Soviets had better
luck with missions to Venus, including the first interplanetary landing in 1970.
These early missions were exploration in the truest sense of the word — 
before NASA’s Mariner 4 mission in 1964, for example, some scientists still 
thought that Mars might have canals and other signs of an ancient civilization.
More-sophisticated spacecraft followed. NASA’s Viking missions to Mars in 
the 1970s provided a wealth of data from two orbiters and two landers. Not 
only that, but these landers actually performed the first search for life on 
another planet. NASA also launched two pairs of spacecraft on a grand tour 
of the outer solar system: Pioneer 10 and 11, and Voyager 1 and 2. Both 
pairs of spacecraft are currently on their way out of the solar system; they 
carry information that may one day identify their origins to a future alien 
civilization.

Early Soviet Mars Probes: Mixed Results 
(1960–1973)
Although not tremendously successful, the Soviet Union made several 
attempts at sending probes to Mars from 1960 through 1973. The Soviets 
deserve credit for getting the ball rolling in terms of Mars exploration, 
but not one of these missions achieved its goal. Of course, with as new 
an enterprise as building interplanetary spacecraft, some failures can be 
anticipated . . . but in the case of Soviet Mars missions, bad luck appears to 
have been involved as well! In the following sections, we describe the few 
successful Mars missions and the many failures.
There were some successes . . .
Despite a number of attempts in the 1960s, the Soviets didn’t have any luck 
with an operational Mars probe until the 1970s. Even then, the few Soviet 
spacecraft that were modest successes couldn’t match the data quality and 
quantity from contemporary NASA missions.
 
The successful Soviet Mars missions were:
 
✓ Mars 2 and Mars 3: Shown in Figure 11-1, these identical missions (1971) 
featured both a lander and an orbiter. Both orbiters succeeded and 
sent back a few observations of the Martian surface and atmosphere. 
However, transmitter problems, less-than-ideal orbits, and a global dust 
storm on Mars substantially reduced the quality and quantity of the 
data. The Mars 2 lander crash-landed, and the Mars 3 lander succeeded 
with a soft landing on the Martian surface, but returned just 20 seconds 
worth of data to Earth before mysteriously going silent. However, the 
working orbiters and one successful soft landing qualify Mars 2 and 
Mars 3 as some of the more successful Soviet Mars missions.
 
✓ Mars 5: The Mars 5 mission (1973) made it into orbit around Mars, and 
in a surprising turn of events for the Soviet Mars program, the lander’s 
cameras worked and returned about 60 images during the nine days it 
survived on the planet. The other onboard instruments relayed infor-
mation about the planet’s surface temperature (a maximum of approxi-
mately 32 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0 degrees Celsius), atmosphere, ozone 
layer, and soil composition.

. . . But even more failures
 
The successful missions outlined in the preceding section were preceded and 
followed by a variety of failures. In addition to a series of flops belonging to 
the numbered Mars program, the Soviet Union launched several other unsuc-
cessful missions to explore the Red Planet. Sending a spacecraft to another 
planet is a difficult task, and the Soviet rockets and boosters of the 1960s suf-
fered from a proliferation of designs that weren’t systematically tested. These 
failures weren’t addressed until the 1970s, when existing designs were consoli-
dated and thoroughly tested, a strategy that has resulted in some extremely 
reliable spacecraft and rocket designs, such as Soyuz (which we introduce in 
Chapter 7).
Following is a rundown of the failed Soviet Mars probes:
 
✓ Marsnik 1 and 2, both launched in October 1960, would’ve attempted 
Mars flybys, but both missions failed on launch.
 
• Marsnik 1 (called Korabl 4, or Mars 1960A) never made it into orbit 
at all, having self-destructed on launch.
 
• Marsnik 2 (called Korabl 5, or Mars 1960B) lifted off, but the third 
rocket stage wasn’t successful in launching the spacecraft into 
Earth orbit.
 
✓ The Sputnik Mars missions constituted three more failed attempts.
 
• Sputnik 22 was launched in 1962 with the intent of doing a Mars 
flyby, but the spacecraft broke apart in orbit.
 
• Sputnik 23, also called Mars 1 (1962), launched successfully, but 
this mission lost communication with Earth before reaching Mars.

158
Part II: The Great Space Race 
 
• Sputnik 24 (also 1962) would’ve landed on Mars had the mission 
been successful; instead, the spacecraft broke up during flight.
 
✓ The failures unfortunately continued with the Zond 2 mission (1964), 
which aimed to conduct a Mars flyby. The Zond 2 spacecraft was 
equipped with cameras and ultraviolet spectrometers, as well as an 
infrared spectrometer that would’ve helped identify the presence of 
methane. But Zond 2 lost communication with Earth and was unable to 
return any data.
 
✓ Mars 1969 A and B (launched in 1969, of course) were matching probes 
designed to orbit the Red Planet, with each spacecraft containing a 
probe and an orbiter. The missions were somewhat covert and not for-
mally introduced to the public at the time of their launch. Unfortunately, 
both missions failed on launch.
 
✓ Mars 1971C (also dubbed the Cosmos 419 mission and launched in 1971) 
was another attempt by the Soviet Union to take advantage of Mars’s 
relative proximity to Earth. Although the Soviets hoped to beat the 
Americans in the race to Mars, this mission succumbed to a rocket mal-
function and never reached its destination.
 
✓ Mars 4 (1973) suffered from equipment failures that doomed its scientific 
productivity. The spacecraft did reach Mars, but a computer malfunc-
tion kept the spacecraft from entering orbit. Only one batch of images 
was returned from this mission.
 
✓ The Mars 6 mission (1973) reached Mars and actually did well enough to 
start sending data back home to Earth as the Mars 6 lander descended 
through the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the transmitted data was mostly 
useless due to a computer chip problem, and all contact was lost just 
before the lander reached the Martian surface.
 
✓ To complete the comedy of errors, the Mars 7 mission (1973) arrived at 
Mars, but its landing probe was prematurely disconnected from the rest 
of the spacecraft. The probe (which was intended to land on the sur-
face) missed the planet entirely.
The Soviet Venera and Vega Programs: 
Reaching Venus Successfully 
(1961–1986)
The Soviet Union may’ve been unlucky when it came to exploring Mars 
(okay, that’s an understatement; see for yourself in the previous section), 
but it experienced dramatic success with missions to Earth’s other neigh-
bor: Venus. The Venera program ran from 1961 through 1984 and boasted 10

 Chapter 11: Going on a Grand Tour of the Solar System
landing probes that gathered data on Venus’s surface, as well as 13 flyby or 
orbital probes that sent data home from the atmosphere surrounding Venus. 
The landers, in particular, were technological marvels that were able to with-
stand the extreme conditions at Venus’s surface: high pressure, temperatures 
hot enough to melt lead, and a corrosive atmosphere. (Check out a Venera 
lander in Figure 11-2.) The subsequent Vega program sent two more Venera-
type spacecraft to visit Venus, with a little flyby of Comet Halley thrown in for 
fun, from 1984 to 1986.

In the following sections, we focus on the details of several particularly nota-
ble missions: Venera 7, 9, 10, 13, and 14, as well as Vega 1 and 2.
Venera 7 (1970): Landing accomplished
 
Venera 7 accomplished what no space mission had up to that point: It landed 
a capsule on another planet. (Remember that the Moon doesn’t count as a 
planet!) Previous Venera missions had included atmospheric probes, which 
sent back data as they traveled through Venus’s atmosphere, but these space-
craft didn’t survive the trip to the surface. Launched in 1970, the Venera 7 
spacecraft made it to Venus and successfully jettisoned its landing capsule, 
which parachuted down to the planet’s surface. Using a raised antenna, the 
capsule sent home radio signals with data regarding Venus’s surface tempera-
ture for 23 minutes before communications ceased.
The transmitter actually got stuck and sent back the surface temperature 
over and over again. However, the Venera 7 mission still counts as the first 
time that data was sent back from the surface of another planet.

Part II: The Great Space Race 
Venera 9 and 10 (1975) and Venera 13 
and 14 (1981): Taking historic pictures
 
The four Venera spacecraft covered in this section all succeeded in capturing 
images of Venus’s surface. These photos were valuable because they were 
mankind’s first views of the surface of a mysterious world whose surface can’t 
be seen from space (unless you have radar eyes!). Though science-fiction-style 
steamy jungles had mostly been ruled out due to Venus’s hot, hot, hot surface 
temperatures, scientists were surprised to see a world that was more Earth-
like than they’d originally imagined.
Although its main goal was to take measurements of the Venusian atmo-
sphere with a variety of instruments, Venera 9, launched in 1975, wound up 
taking the first pictures returned from the surface of another planet. The 
spacecraft had two cameras, one on each of its sides (although one didn’t 
work because a lens cap failed to pop off correctly). The functioning camera 
used a periscope to peek through Venera 9’s hull so it could capture images 
without exposing itself to the extreme temperature and pressure conditions 
on the Venusian surface.
Venera 9 captured relatively low-resolution images, because it was limited 
in the data it could send back during the estimated 30-minute lifetime of the 
lander. It returned multiple images that could be assembled into a panorama 
of Venus’s surface (see Figure 11-3) that was intentionally angled to include 
Surveying the surface conditions of Venus
Probes to the Moon or to Mars were capable 
of surviving and transmitting data for weeks or 
months (or, in some cases, years), but the sur-
face conditions on Venus were much less hospi-
table. Although Venus is similar in size to Earth, 
its atmosphere is so thick that the atmospheric 
pressure at the planet’s surface is almost 
100 times that at the Earth’s surface. Venus’s 
thick clouds trap the Sun’s heat, resulting in 
a surface temperature of about 500 degrees 
Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius). Because of 
the extreme temperature and pressure condi-
tions, the space probes that managed to reach 
Venus’s surface lasted for only around an hour, 
so the amount of data they were able to return 
home was limited.
Ironically, although surface conditions on Venus 
are much harsher than on Mars, landing on the 
former is actually easier than landing on the 
latter. The thick atmosphere means that a series 
of parachutes can slow a spacecraft down from 
interplanetary speeds to a safe landing speed 
without having to rely on complex retrorockets 
to be fired before landing (like the ones needed 
on Mars due to the planet’s thin atmosphere). 
Other landing schemes, such as airbags, have 
also been used on Mars (see Chapter 15), but in 
general, a Venus landing is technologically less 
complicated — at least for 1960s technology. 
Then again, no spacecraft has landed on Venus 
since Vega 1 and Vega 2 in 1985!

the spacecraft (bottom center). The images show a clearly recognizable land-
scape covered with rough rocks.

As an interesting aside, Venera 9 was also the first spacecraft to successfully 
orbit Venus. Not bad for a Soviet space program that was struggling to reclaim 
its status in the Space Race after its many setbacks in Mars exploration
Later in 1975, Venera 10 was similarly successful in taking images of Venus’s 
surface, which revealed a smooth surface similar to a terrestrial lava flow. 
Complete lens cap failures on Venera 11 and 12 caused a slight delay in the 
flow of photos from Venus until 1981 when Venera 13 and 14 successfully 
returned color images of the planet’s surface.
Venera 13 and 14 used a more-sophisticated camera design that allowed 
them to send higher-resolution images back to Earth for a combined total of 
approximately three hours. The color images were made by taking versions 
of the same image using different color filters on the camera. Unlike their pre-
decessors, both cameras worked on Venera 13 and 14, allowing a complete 
view of the terrain surrounding the landers. Turns out the surfaces at both 
of these landing sites are covered with smooth, platelike rocks that are likely 
lava flows. The sky is yellowish, and the surface appears brownish-yellow. 
(Venera 13 and 14 landed relatively close to each other, slightly south of 
Venus’s equator.)
Venera 15 and 16 (1983): 
Mapping Venus
Venera 15 and 16, launched just five days apart in 1983, achieved what previ-
ous Venera missions couldn’t: They mapped Venus’s surface. Although the 
images sent back from previous Venera missions were both novel and useful, 
Venus’s thick atmosphere prevented traditional cameras from seeing through 
to the surface. Thus, a global study of the planet’s surface was impossible 

162
Part II: The Great Space Race 
until radar instrumentation was added to the Venera spacecraft. Why is a 
global study so valuable? Well, global surface maps are essential for under-
standing the geologic history of planets and how features at different parts 
of a planet’s surface relate to each other, when and how they were formed, 
and so on. Such maps can also be used to determine approximately how old 
the surface is, and how recently it was likely to have had active volcanoes or 
other activity.
 
Twinning of spacecraft, or launching a pair of identical spacecraft within a 
very close time frame, was typical in the Soviet space program (as well as 
the American space program), because the combined effort of the two space-
craft was able to provide much more coverage for image mapping than either 
would’ve been able to do alone. In the case of Venera 15 and 16, the two 
spacecraft were designed identically, and the surface-imaging instrumenta-
tion took up enough space that these missions didn’t have entry probes. Each 
spacecraft contained dish antennae for transmitting a signal through the thick 
Venusian clouds and then picking up that signal as it bounced off the surface. 
They also used solar arrays to power the equipment.
Vega 1 and 2 (1984–1986): Landers, 
balloons, and a comet flyby
The final chapter in the Soviet exploration of Venus came with the Vega 
1 and 2 missions, launched in 1984 and arriving at Venus in 1985. These 
twin spacecraft took advantage of the United States’ decision to cancel its 
planned probe to Comet Halley, which passed near the Earth in 1986. The 
Soviet Union stepped in to build a comet probe and soon realized that plan-
etary alignments would allow a spacecraft to fly past Venus on its way to the 
famous comet. To take advantage of this phenomenon, the Soviet Union built 
two more copies of its now well-tested Venera spacecraft, with a few varia-
tions. The most innovative of these tweaks was the addition of a balloon, or 
aerostat, that was released during the spacecraft’s descent into the Venusian 
atmosphere.
The 11-foot (3.4-meter) diameter balloon carried an attached gondola of 
instruments on a long tether. The two aerostats successfully measured 
Venus’s atmospheric composition and tracked its wind currents, sending 
back data for 46 hours until their batteries ran out. During that time, Vega 1 
and 2 floated more than one-third of the distance around the planet at an alti-
tude of about 33 miles (54 kilometers) above the surface. After releasing the 
landers and aerostats, the two Vega spacecraft used Venus’s gravity to travel 
on to their rendezvous with Comet Halley in 1986. By mid-1986, they’d sent 
back more than a thousand pictures of the comet’s nucleus.

 Chapter 11: Going on a Grand Tour of the Solar System
The Mariner Program: Visiting Mercury, 
Venus, and Mars (1962–1975)
Early planetary exploration didn’t belong solely to the Soviet Union. 
American planetary research started with the Mariner Program, the United 
States’ first long-running interplanetary spacecraft program, which was 
intended to start exploring the strange new worlds of Mercury, Mars, and 
Venus. This program consisted of ten space missions, seven of which were 
successes. Two additional missions (Mariner 11 and 12) were planned but 
ended up rolling into the start of the later Voyager Program (which we cover 
later in this chapter).
 
The Mariner spacecraft, which wound up becoming the basis for almost all 
of NASA’s planetary exploration for decades to come, were based on either 
octagonal or hexagonal core units to which the instruments (cameras, anten-
nae, and the like) were attached (see Figure 11-4). Like most other space mis-
sions, solar panels provided the main source of power for both the spacecraft 
and its instrumentation. Atlas rockets, either Centaur or Agena, were used to 
launch the Mariner spacecraft into space.

In the following sections, we provide details of the Mariner missions of the 
1960s and 1970s.

164
Part II: The Great Space Race 
Missions of the 1960s
Even though its focus was on putting a human on the Moon before the 
Soviets could, NASA also set its sights on exploring the rest of the solar 
system in the 1960s. The Moon was close enough to make human space 
travel there feasible, but the initial forays to other planets had to be done by 
robotic spacecraft.
 
The leadoff mission of the Mariner series, Mariner 1 (1962), would’ve done 
a flyby of Venus, but it was destroyed shortly after launch due to a problem 
with the launch rocket. Mariner 2, which was originally intended as a backup 
to the Mariner 1 mission, was a stunning success and became the first space-
craft in the world to fly past another planet. On December 14, 1962, Mariner 
2 came as close as 21,644 miles (34,833 kilometers) to the Venusian surface. 
Another achievement of this monumental flyby was the variety of important 
data it collected, such as cloud temperatures, Venusian surface temperatures 
(the planet measured about 752 degrees Fahrenheit [400 degrees Celsius] on 
the surface), and other data concerning Venus’s atmosphere. Additionally, 
the sensors and instruments aboard Mariner 2 discovered that Venus has no 
major magnetic field or radiation belt surrounding it.
 
After success at Venus, Mars was next on the agenda. The Mars-bound Mariner 
3 spacecraft (1964) was a flop due to launch failure, but Mariner 4 (1964) suc-
cessfully became the first spacecraft to fly by Mars at close range. This mis-
sion was the first time scientists got pictures of the surface of another planet, 
and they were very surprised to see an old, cratered surface that looked much 
more like the Moon than the Earth. Mariner 4’s images thus revolutionized 
society’s view of Mars as a planet (although ironically Mariner 4, 6, and 7 all 
imaged old cratered parts of the Martian surface, missing the younger valleys 
and other interesting features that make Mars more Earth-like). The images 
taken by Mariner 4 at its closest approach were surprisingly sharp; they even 
showed clouds in the thin Martian atmosphere, something scientists didn’t 
expect to see.
Mariner 5 (1967) was originally intended as a backup Mars mission, but after 
the success of Mariner 4, it was retrofitted and sent to Venus. It succeeded 
in taking measurements of Venus’s atmosphere, refining the measurements 
made by Mariner 2 and providing further clues about the planet’s hot surface 
temperature and thick atmosphere.
An American tag team of octagonal spacecraft, Mariner 6 and 7, gained valu-
able information from their flybys of Mars in 1969. Launched about a month 
apart (on February 24 and March 27, respectively), the two spacecraft took 
about 200 pictures of Mars, some from their approach and others at closer 
range. These photos showed a number of details about the north and south 
poles of Mars, in addition to providing images of Mars’s moon Phobos.

165
 Chapter 11: Going on a Grand Tour of the Solar System
Missions of the 1970s
Flyby missions are fine for initial reconnaissance, but to really understand 
a world you need detailed maps produced from observations made in orbit. 
The Mariner flyby missions of the previous decade had produced intrigu-
ing glimpses of Venus and Mars, but without global context, such snapshots 
aren’t that meaningful to geologists. So orbiters were the logical next step in 
planetary exploration.
A pair of twin ships, Mariner 8 and 9, would’ve become the world’s first 
Martian satellites. They were intended to continue the data collection begun 
by the Mariner 6 and 7 missions and perform a detailed mapping of the 
Martian surface. However, Mariner 8 (launched in 1971) failed during launch 
and fell back into the ocean. The honor of being the first spacecraft to orbit 
another planet fell to Mariner 9 alone.
 
Mariner 9 entered orbit around Mars in November 1971. From there, it pre-
pared to photograph the Martian surface and took atmospheric measure-
ments using instruments much like those aboard its immediate predecessors. 
The actual taking of the photos was delayed due to a giant global dust storm 
on Mars that completely obscured the surface. Fortunately, engineers on 
Earth were able to wait for the dust to clear several months later before begin-
ning the imaging program. Ultimately, Mariner 9 was able to map more than 
80 percent of the Martian surface from orbit. A full geologic picture emerged 
as a result, complete with images of valleys, huge volcanoes, canyons, and 
evidence of geologic features carved by both wind and water. This mission 
rekindled interest in Mars as a possible location for past, or current, life.
The final spacecraft in the Mariner Program, Mariner 10 (1973) was the first 
spacecraft ever to take advantage of gravity-assisted trajectory, a technique that 
uses the gravitational attraction of one planet to propel a spacecraft toward 
its next goal in an effort to conserve both fuel and power. In this case, Mariner 
10 was slated to fly past Venus and then continue on to Mercury, where it 
could make multiple flybys. Mariner 10 used its ultraviolet cameras to take 
detailed images of the structure of the Venusian clouds, but the real prize of 
the mission was Mercury. Three Mercury flybys, in 1974 and 1975, revealed an 
ancient, battered surface covered with impact craters, but with signs of old 
volcanic activity and some cracks and faults. Mariner 10 was only able to map 
one hemisphere of Mercury; the other hemisphere remained unseen for more 
than 30 years until the MESSENGER mission (see Chapter 21).

Part II: The Great Space Race 
Pioneer 10 and 11: Exploring the 
Outer Solar System (1972–2003)
Americans weren’t content with just exploring the Moon and the inner solar 
system. They longed to expand their pioneering spirit to the vast reaches 
of the outer solar system. Thus, the Pioneer Project was born. This widely 
focused series of missions, which started in the late 1950s and continued 
through 1978, served to increase people’s knowledge both of space science 
and technological potential in the inner and outer solar system.
 
✓ Pioneer 0–2 were failed attempts to reach the Moon.
 
✓ Pioneer 3 and 4 were successful Moon exploration missions.
 
✓ Pioneer 5–9 explored magnetic fields and solar activity.
 
✓ Pioneer 12 entered orbit around Venus in 1978, mapped the planet’s 
surface via radar, studied the atmosphere, and recorded other key mea-
surements for the next 14 years.
 
✓ Pioneer 13, which launched in 1978, took specialized measurements 
using four different probes that were sent to different locations around 
Venus.
Pioneer 10 and 11, though, stand out from the crowd as the first spacecraft 
to make the trip to Saturn and Jupiter. These planets are referred to as outer 
planets or outer solar system planets because they lie outside the asteroid 
belt; the other outer planets are Uranus and Neptune. In the following sec-
tions, we describe the launch and journey of both spacecraft.
Providing the first views 
of Jupiter and Saturn
Pioneer 10, launched on March 2, 1972, made history as the first space probe, 
or man-made object of any kind, ever to fly through the asteroid belt success-
fully. It returned valuable images and other data from Jupiter. Pioneer 10 also 
found that Jupiter has a very strong magnetic field that produces high levels 
of radiation in its immediate vicinity. After its Jupiter flyby, Pioneer 10’s tra-
jectory took it out of the solar system.
 
Pioneer 11 was no less of a success. The twin to Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11 
launched on April 5, 1973. As it made its Jupiter flyby, the spacecraft came 
within 21,000 miles (34,000 kilometers) of the clouds surrounding Jupiter and 
was able to photograph the planet and Callisto, one of its primary moons. After 
its successful Jupiter flyby, Pioneer 11 used Jupiter’s gravity to change its tra-
jectory and send itself on to Saturn. The spacecraft’s Saturn flyby was equally 
successful, sending home images of Saturn, as well as its rings and moons.

167
 Chapter 11: Going on a Grand Tour of the Solar System
 
Some of the instruments aboard Pioneer 11 were designed to measure solar 
wind, cosmic rays, and magnetic fields — the same types of things studied by 
the Apollo astronauts on the Moon (as explained in Chapters 9 and 10). 
However, the Pioneer spacecraft also measured specific elements in the 
Jupiter and Saturn atmospheres, such as radio waves and aurorae (atmo-
spheric interactions due to a planet’s magnetic field and solar wind; the result 
looks like the aurora borealis [northern lights] observed here on Earth).
Staying in touch for more than 20 years
Although it seems that nothing lasts beyond its warranty these days, space-
craft can be an exception. Both Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 stayed in contact 
with Earth for more than two decades.
 
✓ Pioneer 10 was still making contact with Earth as recently as 2003, when 
it was 7.5 billion miles (12 billion kilometers) from Earth. The space-
craft’s power has likely declined now to the point where sending signals 
home is no longer possible.
 
✓ Pioneer 11’s mission came to completion in 1995, because no further 
communications have been received since then. The likely reason for 
this communications shutdown is that the spacecraft’s onboard power 
generator has expired.
 
The fact that these spacecraft remained in contact as long as they did is a tes-
tament to superior design and mission planning. The two spacecraft sent back 
valuable data about particles and fields in the far reaches of the solar system. 
In addition, the simple tracking of their orbits has yielded interesting informa-
tion about chaos theory and orbital interactions in complex systems. And last 
but certainly not least, Pioneer 10 was used as a test target for flight engineers 
learning how to talk to faraway spacecraft.
Bearing plaques for alien encounters
 
Even though they’ve lost touch with Earth, Pioneer 10 and 11 are still capable 
of communicating. As the first man-made objects to be sent out of the solar 
system, both spacecraft bear a plaque (shown in Figure 11-5) designed by 
leading scientists as a message for any future intelligent beings that might 
encounter them. The plaque includes a drawing of a naked man and woman 
next to a schematic of the spacecraft, for scale. It also includes a diagram of a 
hydrogen atom, markers to indicate the position of our Sun, and a map of the 
solar system with a special marker to point out Earth.

Where might these plaques come in handy? Well, both spacecraft are on 
trajectories that will eventually take them to the stars:
 
✓ Pioneer 10 is heading toward the star Aldebaran, in the constellation 
Taurus, and will take about 2 million years to get there.
 
✓ Pioneer 11 is heading toward the constellation Aquila, a journey that’ll 
take about 4 million years to complete.
Viking 1 and 2: Embarking on a 
Mission to Mars (1975–1982)
With the knowledge that Mars is much more Earth-like than originally thought 
(thanks to the findings of Mariner 9 in 1971; see the earlier section for details), 
NASA was inspired to create an ambitious Martian exploration program that 
was motivated as much by scientific goals as by political showmanship (the 
Soviet Union had yet to have a successful Mars landing). Martian features such 
as canyons and valleys that appeared to have been carved by liquid water, 
combined with the hot surface temperatures and noxious clouds of Venus that 
could in no way support life, rekindled interest in Mars as a possible location 
for life in the solar system. So began the United States’ efforts to find evidence 
of life on Mars.
Taking a page from the successful Soviet strategy of twin spacecraft, described 
earlier in this chapter, NASA built Viking 1 and 2. The two spacecraft included 
both an orbiter, for global mapping, and a lander, for landing on another planet 

169
 Chapter 11: Going on a Grand Tour of the Solar System
and searching for life. (Both the orbiter and lander go by Viking 1 and 2 . . . so 
much for originality in the naming process, huh?)
 
The Viking Program didn’t come out of nowhere. It built on the past achieve-
ments of the Mariner Program, as well as lessons learned from successful 
lunar landers and orbiters such as Surveyor and Lunar Orbiter (see Chapter 8 
for details). The concept behind the mission was to send two spacecraft to 
Mars, separated by about a month. Each would land at a different site while 
their orbiters remained in space to complete their missions of imaging the 
planet and conducting other studies from space.
The Viking 1 mission departed on August 20, 1975, and arrived in Mars orbit 
nearly a year later. The orbiter and lander stayed united for about a month 
while they photographed the planet and looked for a landing site. Meanwhile, 
the Viking 2 mission launched on September 9, 1975, reaching Mars orbit 
in August 1976. The Viking 1 lander detached from its orbiter on July 20, 
1976, and reached the Mars surface at Chryse Planitia. The Viking 2 lander 
wasn’t far behind, landing at another area of Mars called Utopia Planitia on 
September 3, 1976.
Orbiting and landing on Mars
The Viking orbiters and landers had different goals and designs, but both 
provided necessary functions:
 
✓ The orbiter for both Viking 1 and 2 was primarily for transporting the 
corresponding lander to Mars, taking survey photos that would help 
determine a landing site, and relaying transmissions from the lander 
back to Earth while continuing to map the surface. The orbiter design 
was octagonal in shape, measuring about 8 feet (2.5 meters) wide. Solar 
panel wings provided power for the spacecraft on its voyage to Mars 
and while in orbit; initial propulsion was provided by a liquid-fueled 
rocket.
 
✓ The Viking mission lander was a six-sided, three-dimensional object 
with three legs that came out to rest on the ground. It was propelled 
by rocket thrusters and engines; landing radar, gyros, and an altimeter 
helped control its landing. It was powered by two radioisotope thermo-
electric generators, a type of electrical generator that uses the radioac-
tive decay of plutonium to provide energy. Communications back to the 
orbiter, which were relayed to Earth, took place via transmitters and 
antennae. The Viking 1 and 2 landers used hydrazine fuel in their landing 
thrusters to slow their descent through the thin Martian atmosphere for 
a safe arrival on the surface.
The orbiters from the Viking 1 and 2 missions led productive lives: The 
Viking 1 orbiter made more than 1,400 orbits around Mars over the course 

170
Part II: The Great Space Race 
of four years, and the Viking 2 orbiter completed about half that many 
orbits in two years. The images taken from these spacecraft gave scientists 
the most complete and detailed image maps of the Martian surface until the 
Mars Global Surveyor arrived at Mars 20 years later, in 1997 (see Chapter 15).
The Viking landers were also very long-lived: The Viking 2 lander 
successfully sent back data for more than three and a half years until its 
battery failed in 1980, and the Viking 1 lander operated for more than six 
years until 1982, when a faulty software update mistakenly deleted essen-
tial data used by the lander to point its antenna at Earth, shutting down 
communication.
Searching for Martian life
 
The scientific goal of the Viking missions was clear: Study the biological, 
physical, chemical, and other properties of Mars’s atmosphere and 
surface in an effort to better understand the planet and its potential to 
support life. Each Viking lander housed numerous instruments, including 
cameras, sample-collection devices, and temperature and wind sensors, 
to help it fulfill this goal. (You can see some of these instruments in 
Figure 11-6, taken on the surface of Mars.)

 Chapter 11: Going on a Grand Tour of the Solar System
 
The lander cameras were able to image the surface using a high-tech version 
of smoke and mirrors. Movable mirrors were aimed at vertical strips of the 
landscape; photodetectors then measured the light reflected from those mir-
rors back into the cameras. The cameras were then moved for the next scan, 
and these strips were recombined later to form a complete image.
The Viking 1 and 2 landers didn’t just rely on imaging in their search for 
Martian life. Both landers had their own robotic arm with a soil scoop that 
could dig small trenches on the surface of Mars and bring the soil into the 
spacecraft for chemical analysis.
Planetary protection
At the dawn of the Space Age, science fic-
tion blended with science fact to produce a 
view of the solar system that included life on 
other planets. Although the first missions to the 
Moon, Mars, and Venus revealed harsh con-
ditions that seemed unlikely to support life as 
we know it, scientists knew life could still exist 
elsewhere in the solar system. In 1966, the U.S. 
and several other nations signed a space explo-
ration treaty, part of which requires that nations 
protect other planets and the Earth from con-
tamination due to space exploration.
Planetary protection is designed into space mis-
sions for two reasons: to avoid contaminating 
the planets being explored and to prevent any 
byproduct of the mission from causing recipro-
cal harm to Earth. Keeping the other planets 
free from biological contaminants helps pre-
serve them in pristine form for future research. 
Keeping the Earth free from potential extra-
terrestrial contaminants is, similarly, a clear 
preventative measure against the unknown. 
Although all missions have some form of plan-
etary protection, it becomes most critical when 
astronauts or robotic landers bring samples 
back to Earth.
The first few Apollo crews to land on the Moon 
were actually kept in isolation following their 
return to Earth. The Apollo 11 astronauts, for 
example, climbed out of their floating Command/
Service Module (CSM) after it splashed down 
and went straight into a decontamination raft. 
They were washed with a bleachlike cleanser 
and hustled into a quarantine unit for the next 
several weeks. Their decontamination raft was 
actually sunk so as to eliminate the potential 
spreading of any lunar microbes they may have 
picked up, and their CSM was washed with an 
antiseptic before it was hauled onto the USS 
Hornet. Fortunately for the astronauts, these 
procedures were substantially reduced after 
Apollo 14 when it became clear that return-
ing astronauts didn’t succumb to any sort of 
lunar flu.
The Viking landers, with their life-detection 
experiments, took extraordinary precautions 
to avoid contaminating the Martian surface. In 
many ways they set the gold standard for plane-
tary protection. The hydrazine used in the land-
ing rockets, for example, was purified in order 
to try to reduce the chance of contaminating 
the Martian surface as the chemical burned. As 
the landers separated and traveled into Martian 
orbit, they were covered with an aeroshell that 
prevented microbes and organisms from flying 
off into the Martian atmosphere. The landers 
were also deliberately exposed to very high 
temperatures inside this aeroshell in another 
effort to prevent the spread of Earth bugs into 
Martian space.

172
Part II: The Great Space Race 
Following are some of the experiments the landers ran on the Martian soil:
 
✓ The gas-exchange experiment looked to see whether compounds in 
Martian soil would exhibit lifelike symptoms after being stimulated with 
organic material.
 
✓ The labeled-release experiment studied the surface after introducing 
radioactive gas to see whether live organisms would emit carbon diox-
ide gas.
 
✓ The carbon-assimilation experiment tested for the creation of carbon 
compounds.
 
None of these tests proved conclusively that there was life (as we know it, 
at least) on Mars. This fact doesn’t mean the Viking missions weren’t enor-
mously successful. However, the intense excitement surrounding the search 
for life — and the failure to successfully detect it — meant that Mars explora-
tion basically came to a standstill at the end of the Viking missions. After an 
expenditure of close to a billion dollars on the Viking Program, no successful 
missions were sent to Mars for more than 20 years (see Chapter 15 for the 
scoop on these later successes).
Voyager 1 and 2: To Jupiter and 
Beyond (1977–Present)
Once named Mariner 11 and Mariner 12, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are the main 
players in the most successful and longest-lasting missions of solar-system 
exploration. The two spacecraft, launched in 1977, were conceived of as a 
way to take advantage of a rare planetary alignment that would allow them to 
visit and study Jupiter and Saturn, as well as Uranus and Neptune if all went 
well. The particular orbital locations of these four planets provided a prime 
opportunity for the spacecraft to conserve both fuel and power by using the 
gravitational attraction of one planet to propel them toward their next goal, 
a technique known as gravity-assisted trajectory. Without this extra boost, the 
missions likely wouldn’t be enjoying such long-lasting success.
 
The identically designed twin Voyager spacecraft were stabilized and con-
trolled using gyroscopes. Data was managed through a digital tape recorder 
(an 8-track, no less!); it was sent and received via the spacecraft’s 12-foot (3.7-
meter) antenna. The wide- and narrow-angled cameras that made up the imag-
ing subsystem were controlled via computer. Both Voyager spacecraft still 
carry a range of instruments designed to help them do their jobs, including 
high- and low-field magnetometers to measure the strength and direction of 
magnetic fields and spectrometers to measure the composition of planets and 
atmospheres. At the height of the missions, each of the 11 main instrument 
systems had a team on Earth dedicated to studying and compiling the results 
of its findings.

Voyager 1: Whizzing by 
Jupiter and Saturn
Launched on September 5, 1977 — about two weeks after Voyager 2 — 
Voyager 1 arrived at Jupiter first to fulfill the initial part of its mission: observ-
ing Jupiter and its moons. Beginning in March 1979, the spacecraft took 
images and gathered other data during its month-long trip through Jupiter’s 
system. One of its major discoveries was the existence of active volcanoes 
erupting on Jupiter’s moon Io (see Figure 11-7).

As Voyager 1 used Jupiter’s gravity to swing onward toward Saturn, it was 
able to take close observations of Saturn’s moon Titan, as well as Saturn’s 
rings. Its closest approach to Saturn occurred in November 1980. (You can 
see an image of Saturn taken by Voyager 1 in the color section.)
The mysterious, large moon Titan was a prime target of the Voyager 1 mis-
sion, and the spacecraft trajectory was carefully designed to allow for a close 
flyby. Unfortunately, Titan’s thick, hazy atmosphere completely blocked any 
views of the surface from orbit, and the much-anticipated pictures of Titan 
showed nothing more than a fuzzy orange ball.
Despite the Titan disappointment, the data Voyager 1 collected over the 
years has contributed immensely to astronomers’ understanding of inter-
planetary space. With its mission completed, Voyager 1 began making its way 
out of the solar system; it currently can lay claim to the title of “farthest man-
made object from the Earth.”

174
Part II: The Great Space Race 
Voyager 2: Making discoveries everywhere
 
Despite losing the race to Jupiter (Voyager 2 reached the planet three months 
after Voyager 1), Voyager 2 has become known as one of the greatest and 
most-prolific exploratory space missions in history because it made significant 
discoveries everywhere it went. During the first leg of its journey, Voyager 2 
accomplished the following:
 
✓ It encountered and documented new rings of Jupiter. It also showed the 
Great Red Spot, a storm vortex located on the South equatorial belt of 
Jupiter. Voyager 1 and various Earth-based astronomers had viewed the 
huge storm system before but never with such detail and accuracy.
 
✓ It took close-up pictures of Jupiter’s moon Europa, revealing a network 
of cracks and ridges and a very young surface.
 
✓ It made measurements of Saturn’s temperature (ranging from –333 
degrees Fahrenheit to –202 degrees Fahrenheit [–203 degrees Celsius 
to –130 degrees Celsius]) and took some of the most-dynamic views of 
Saturn ever seen.
After Voyager 2 completed exploring Saturn at close range, it proved to have 
sufficient fuel and functionality left to continue on what scientists had hoped 
would be the next leg of its journey: a visit to Uranus. Following the disap-
pointment of Voyager 1’s hazy observations of the moon Titan (described in 
the preceding section), scientists fortunately were able to change Voyager 2’s 
trajectory before it reached the Saturn system. Instead of achieving another 
unsatisfying Titan flyby, the mission navigators at NASA redirected Voyager 
2 so it could continue its grand tour of the solar system past Uranus and 
Neptune. Fortunately Voyager 2 had enough fuel to continue on its new trajec-
tory, because there aren’t any gas stations in the outer solar system!
 
After a mission continuation was authorized and funded, the spacecraft pro-
ceeded to gather valuable images and data along the way to Uranus. Upon its 
arrival there in August 1986, Voyager 2 took photos; contributed new informa-
tion about the planet’s magnetic field, rotation, and radiation belts; and made 
the rings and moons of Uranus visible in clear detail for the first time. Voyager 
2 was eventually funded for a pass by Neptune as well, and the spacecraft 
came within close range of the planet in August 1989. Major discoveries from 
this part of the mission included images of the moon Triton and a large, long-
lived storm in the atmosphere of Uranus dubbed the Great Dark Spot.

be read by future alien civilizations that might encounter the probes, but

The gold-plated copper records, filled with a wide variety of sounds and 
images intended to capture the range of human experience, are meant to 
serve as a time capsule of sorts. Scientists, led by the famed astronomer 
Carl Sagan, carefully debated the impression that each and every sound 
and image might give a future extraterrestrial civilization. Here’s what they 
decided to include on the records:
 
✓ Audio: Voices in numerous languages, natural sounds, and music from 
many cultures
 
✓ Visual: Photographs of people, buildings, animals, and other natural and 
artificial scenes
The cover of the record includes reference points to help determine the loca-
tion of the solar system in which Earth resides.
Still checking in
The Voyager spacecraft were built and designed to last for about five years. 
Yet 30 years later, they’re still sending data and information back to Earth 
(albeit not a lot these days), thereby contributing to the history of space 
research.

176
Part II: The Great Space Race 
 
Both spacecraft are currently on their way out of the solar system. In 1998, 
Voyager 1 passed Pioneer 10’s distance to become the man-made object that’s 
most distant from the Sun. The meager information the twin spacecraft now 
send back to Earth focuses on interstellar studies, and 5 of the original 11 
instrument teams are still supporting their group’s data acquisition and analy-
sis. Both spacecraft are investigating the very edge of the Sun’s influence and 
the interaction of that region with the space between the stars. It’ll be at least 
40,000 years before either spacecraft makes a close encounter with another 
star system.
How long can the Voyager spacecraft continue producing data? Scientists 
estimate that the two spacecraft are good for at least another ten years, or 
until the probes finally run out of power. (Currently, power levels are still 
about 60 percent of what they were at launch time.) Another consideration, 
though, is the fact that the thermocouples used to convert that heat into 
electricity degrade over time, which could further decrease the amount of 
time that the power supplies will be useful. Eventually, the spacecraft will 
no longer have enough power to send a signal back to Earth, similar to what 
occurred with the Pioneer spacecraft. In the vacuum of space, however, 
they’ll continue silently on their journey until something, or someone, gets in 
their way.

The First Space Stations and 
the End of the Space Race
In This Chapter
▶ Inhabiting space in the various Soviet Salyut stations
▶ Jumping into the space station game with the American Skylab program
▶ Cooperating internationally with Apollo-Soyuz
T
he Apollo Moon landings (described in Chapters 9 and 10) were a tri-
umph for the United States, but such a level of accomplishment couldn’t 
be sustained on either side of the Space Race after the politically motivated 
megagoal of being first to the Moon was achieved. Thus, both the U.S. and 
Soviet space programs set their sights on more-modest goals closer to home, 
in Earth orbit. The Americans scaled down Project Apollo to meet new orbital 
objectives, and the Soviets launched their successful Soyuz program, which 
took cosmonauts into orbit and ferried them to and from a succession of 
space stations. (Believe it or not, a version of the Soyuz spacecraft is cur-
rently servicing the International Space Station; see Chapter 7 for more about 
Soyuz.)
Following the limited-duration flights of the Apollo and Soyuz programs, both 
the U.S. and the Soviet Union developed early space stations that allowed 
humans to remain in space for longer periods of time. The Soviet Salyut sta-
tion and American Skylab station both allowed humans to remain in Earth 
orbit for months at a time. (One goal of such long-duration flights was to 
begin preparation for a human mission to Mars, a feat that would involve 
months or years in flight and has yet to be achieved.)
A final politically motivated mission remained: In 1975, the U.S. and Soviet 
Union staged a joint mission, Apollo-Soyuz, during which spacecraft from the 
two nations actually docked in orbit. Widely considered the end of the Space 
Race, this incident ushered in a new era of reduced hostilities between the 
two superpowers. In this chapter, we fill you in on the details of this joint 
mission, as well as the two nations’ respective space station programs.

178
Part II: The Great Space Race 
Shrouded in Secrecy: The Early Salyut 
Program (1971–1973)
After failing to reach the Moon before its American rivals, the Soviet Union 
set its sights on putting the first space station into orbit around Earth — a 
goal that ultimately led to the creation of the Salyut program. The Soviets 
launched nine separate space station modules, six of which met enough of 
their mission requirements to be considered successes.
Unlike today’s International Space Station (which we cover in Chapter 19), all 
the Salyuts were completely separate, self-contained units that didn’t dock 
with one another. Each Salyut module was designed as a stand-alone space 
station that fit one of two models:
 
✓ Long-Duration Station (acronym DOS in Russian) units: This model was 
made up of a transfer compartment, a main compartment, and an auxil-
iary compartment. The main compartment included scientific equipment 
such as telescopes and cameras. Six of the Salyut stations fell into this 
category.
 
✓ Orbital Piloted Station (OPS) units: Intended for military rather than 
civilian work, these models included an airlock, a larger work compart-
ment, and a smaller living compartment. The work compartment was 
primarily designed around a large Earth observation camera that the 
cosmonauts used to take photos of various sensitive locations. They 
then developed the film and scanned it for return to Earth. Three of the 
Salyut stations were OPS units.
In the following sections, we describe the first few missions of the Salyut 
program, from 1971 to 1973. Flip to the later section “Building on Experience: 
Later Salyut Missions (1974–1991)” for the scoop on Salyut 3 through 
Salyut 7.
Salyut 1: Launching and docking 
with Soyuz 11 (1971)
 
The first space station in the world, Salyut 1, was launched into orbit by the 
Soviets on April 19, 1971. Its purpose — other than beating the Americans 
into space with a station — was to begin exploring how humans could survive 
in space for long periods of time. In addition, Salyut 1 provided an excellent 
opportunity to photograph Earth from afar and study cosmic rays, gamma 
rays, and other astronomical phenomena that can’t be observed from the 
ground. A DOS-type orbital station, Salyut 1 measured about 52 feet by 13 
feet (16 meters by 4 meters) and was launched into space by a Soviet Proton 
launch vehicle.

179
 Chapter 12: The First Space Stations and the End of the Space Race
Salyut 1, like all space stations to come in the future, was launched without 
a crew onboard because the constraints to get humans safely into orbit are 
much stricter than for equipment. By launching the space station unoccu-
pied, the designers didn’t have to include space-wasters like seats that would 
only be used on launch, and the station could be blasted into orbit at gravita-
tional accelerations that would be unsafe for human occupants.
Of course, a manned space station is fairly useless without a crew, so the 
Soviets sent three cosmonauts to Salyut 1 as part of the Soyuz 10 mission. 
The men successfully launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome on April 22, 
1971, but they were unable to dock with the space station because of a hatch 
problem.
 
The next mission to try to visit Salyut 1, Soyuz 11, had more initial success. 
Crewed by Georgi Dobrovolski, Vladislav Volkov, and Viktor Patsayev, Soyuz 
11 made it to the space station and successfully docked with it on June 7, 
1971. This event was a monumental achievement because it was the first time 
in history that a spacecraft had performed a docking with a space station.
Unfortunately, the Soyuz 11 mission ended tragically (see Chapter 5 for 
details). After Dobrovolski, Patsayev, and Volkov spent 24 days living on the 
world’s first space station, their Soyuz capsule lost pressure during reen-
try, and all three astronauts were found dead upon landing. Salyut 1 itself 
reentered the Earth’s atmosphere on October 11, 1971, burning up over the 
Pacific Ocean.
Salyut 2 and Cosmos 557 (1973)
The second Salyut mission, named DOS-2, launched in July 1972 but never 
made it into orbit due to a faulty launch vehicle. The actual Salyut 2 mission 
was launched on April 4, 1973, and the space station was a military OPS unit 
rather than the more-common DOS type used for civilian purposes. Salyut 2

launched successfully, but the crewed mission was postponed and eventu-
ally canceled as the station began losing pressure and power. The Soviets 
abandoned the station, and it burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere on May 
28, 1973.
The last of the early Salyut missions, dubbed Cosmos 557, was another DOS-
type station that would’ve further advanced Soviet space station capabili-
ties. However, it also ended in failure. This space station launched on May 
11, 1973, but it failed to reach a stable orbit and burned up in Earth’s atmo-
sphere a week later.
Skylab: NASA’s First Home 
in the Sky (1973–1979)
While the Soviet Union was successfully launching the world’s first space 
station into orbit (see the earlier section on Salyut 1), the U.S. was develop-
ing its own version of a space station. Named Skylab, this orbiting space 
station may have come in second in this particular Space Race contest, but 
it achieved a number of important scientific goals. Its primary mission was 
to prove that astronauts could live in space for more than a few days; it was 
also intended to study the Earth and stars from a new perspective.
Another important programmatic reason for Skylab was to continue NASA’s 
human spaceflight program during the period between the cancellation of 
Project Apollo and the launch of the next generation of space-transportation 
systems, the Space Shuttle, which was still almost a decade away at this 
point. (Check out Chapters 13 and 14 for the scoop on the Space Shuttle.) 
The space station even featured some Apollo hardware left over from the 
canceled Apollo 18, 19, and 20 flights.
The following sections highlight the launch of Skylab, the subsequent mis-
sions to it, and the space station’s eventual return to Earth. (Be sure to flip to 
the color section for an image of Skylab.)
Launching Skylab
Skylab’s debut took place on May 14, 1973, when it launched into space on a 
two-stage version of NASA’s huge Saturn V Moon rocket. The space station 
suffered damage during launch and ended up losing both a main solar panel 
and a cover designed to protect the laboratory and living areas from heat 
and micrometeorite damage. A second solar panel became stuck and didn’t 
deploy correctly.

181
 Chapter 12: The First Space Stations and the End of the Space Race
Because the Saturn rockets had never experienced a launch failure, NASA sci-
entists and engineers were stunned at the possible loss of their space station. 
Teams worked around the clock following the launch to devise ways to fix the 
damage, delaying the first crew launch by ten days to test out the procedures 
and fabricate replacement hardware. The astronauts of the first Skylab crew 
worked to repair the damage during their first spacewalk (the more-common 
term for an extravehicular activity [EVA] done in space) after arriving at the 
station in an Apollo capsule (see the next section for details).
Not a small affair, Skylab weighed closed to 100 tons when it left Earth and 
contained both living space and scientific instruments. It basically served as 
a floating laboratory stuffed with instruments that could take atmospheric 
and other scientific measurements. It also carried water, food, oxygen, and 
other life-supporting equipment for its future astronaut occupants.
Living in the sky
Three separate crews of three astronauts each took up residence in Skylab 
during its six years in orbit, for a total length of 171 days. Perhaps even more 
impressive is that the crew of each of these Skylab missions set a series of 
increasing records for the longest amount of time in space. Each group was 
brought to Skylab and returned home via Apollo spacecraft launched on 
Saturn IB launch vehicles. (Figure 12-1 shows a crew inside Skylab.) The fol-
lowing sections break down the details of the three manned Skylab missions.
Skylab 2
Skylab 2 (named that because the first launch of the Skylab program was 
unmanned) was the first manned mission to reach the United States’ first 
orbiting space station. Commander Charles Conrad, Jr.; Pilot Paul Weitz; and 
Science Pilot Joseph Kerwin were charged with getting the station up and 
running after the problems at launch, testing the ability of astronauts to live 
and work in space for long periods, and performing a number of scientific 
experiments. This first crew launched on May 25, 1973.

When the astronauts arrived at the space station, they found that the tem-
perature inside Skylab, which had lost its heat shield at launch, had risen 
to 126 degrees Fahrenheit (52 degrees Celsius). The men immediately set 
about deploying a replacement heat shield before the plastic inside the space 
station could melt. They were also able to perform a spacewalk to deploy a 
stuck solar panel, restoring minimum power levels to Skylab.

 Chapter 12: The First Space Stations and the End of the Space Race
Of course, the Skylab 2 astronauts didn’t just spend their time repairing 
the space station and going about their day-to-day business. They actually 
performed more than 300 experiments, including many on themselves in an 
effort to better understand how humans react to living in microgravity. Other 
experiments focused on studying the atmospheres of the Sun and Earth from 
space. In particular, the 25,000 pictures of the Sun taken by the Skylab 2 crew 
advanced studies of solar physics immensely with observations that couldn’t 
be done from the ground.
When the Skylab 2 astronauts left the space station, they had spent a record 
28 days in orbit, doubling the previous U.S. record. However, they left behind 
a little something on Skylab: When the next crew arrived, they were surprised 
to find dummies made by the first Skylab crew already hard at work, perched 
on the exercise bicycle, toilet, and medical station!
Skylab 3
Skylab 3 launched one month after its predecessor. The mission further 
tested the abilities of astronauts to perform valuable scientific experiments 
in space and understand the medical effects of long periods in micrograv-
ity. The Skylab 3 astronauts (Commander Alan Bean, Pilot Jack Lousma, and 
Science Pilot Owen Garriott) installed a more-permanent sunshade on the 
station to protect it from overheating. They also performed a number of 
other experiments and medical tests and kept careful records regarding the 
changes in the human body after long stays in space.
 
The Skylab 3 crew also brought a number of experiments to the space sta-
tion that had been designed by high school students around the country. One 
interesting student experiment brought two spiders to the station and moni-
tored how the webs they spun in zero gravity differed from spider webs spun 
on Earth.

All together, the astronauts spent a total of 59 days in space, breaking all 
endurance records up to that point. Of course, the astronauts got so used to 
being in space that after their return to Earth, Lousma absent-mindedly let 
go of his razor while shaving, expecting it to float in place as it had aboard 
Skylab!
Skylab 4
Skylab 4 featured the last crew to occupy Skylab. Commander Gerald Carr, 
Pilot William Pogue, and Science Pilot Edward Gibson launched to the space 
station on November 16, 1973, and stayed there through February 8, 1974, 
setting a world record with 84 days in space. Among their significant work 
was the observation of Comet Kohoutek, which was discovered in March 
1973 and was kind enough to make an appearance for the Skylab 4 astro-
nauts. Observations of the comet were made from inside Skylab, outside 
the spacecraft on two separate spacewalks, and with the onboard Apollo 
Telescope Mount.
 
The Apollo Telescope Mount was a solar observatory that went for a ride on 
Skylab. It was made from a reconfigured Apollo Lunar Module from one of the 
canceled Moon landings. The telescope included a range of ultraviolet instru-
ments designed to be used for solar observation, along with equipment to per-
form other science experiments.
When the final Skylab crew came home, the space station was essentially 
abandoned in orbit. The original plan was to send another crew in 1979 
via NASA’s next-generation spacecraft, the Space Shuttle, in order to boost 
Skylab into a higher, safer orbit. However, the first Space Shuttle flight wasn’t 
until 1981.
Making a splash
Skylab was intended to remain in orbit for about eight years, which still 
would’ve made a Space Shuttle docking in 1981 a possibility, but the Sun 
didn’t quite cooperate. The Earth’s atmosphere was hotter than expected 
due to high levels of solar activity, which increased the drag on Skylab from 
the Earth’s outer atmosphere and degraded the space station’s orbit more 
quickly that initially expected.
Skylab ended up reentering Earth’s atmosphere in 1979. Most of the station 
burned up as it passed through, but some pieces of the 100-ton space station 
survived the blaze and became scattered throughout the Indian Ocean and 
parts of Australia.

Building on Experience: Later 
Salyut Missions (1974–1991)
At the same time that NASA was conducting missions to its single Skylab space 
station, the Soviet Union continued to enhance its leading role in space station 
design and occupation by launching multiple Salyut stations. Each one was vis-
ited by more and more crews and remained in space for longer periods of time.
The Salyut program progressed through 1991, with each mission experienc-
ing varying degrees of success. Although Salyut set several records, it was 
also plagued by problems that led to its eventual abandonment as a human-
occupied space station.
Salyut 3: Controlling its own 
orientation (1974–1975)
Unlike any of the previous Salyut space stations (described earlier in this 
chapter), Salyut 3 used special thrusters to regulate its orientation while in 
space, becoming the first spacecraft to keep stable while pointing at the same

Tensions were still high at this point in the Cold War, and although Salyut 
3 was disguised as part of the civilian Salyut program, its true mission was 
to test military capabilities in space. Not only was Salyut 3 equipped with 
a high-powered camera that could resolve objects as small as 10 feet (3 
meters) on the ground, but it also had a so-called self-defense cannon that 
was actually fired in space. Records from that time are sketchy, but later 
reports from cosmonauts indicate that the onboard gun, similar to an aircraft 
cannon, fired shells that destroyed a test satellite.
Crew members for Salyut 3 were transported to the space station via the 
Soyuz 14 mission. Commander Pavel Popovich and Flight Engineer Yuri 
Artyukin launched on July 3, 1974, and docked successfully with the space 
station. During their roughly two weeks of living inside Salyut 3, the cosmo-
nauts tested a range of military reconnaissance features, as well as the feasi-
bility of a newly designed exercise suit created especially for the mission.

Salyut 4: Three visits from Soyuz 
(1974–1977)
 
Salyut 4, a DOS-type station launched into space on December 26, 1974, was 
significant in that two manned Soyuz missions managed to make contact and 
dock:
 
✓ In January 1975, Soyuz 17 brought Commander Aleksei Gubarev and 
Flight Engineer Oleg Makarov to the space station, where they stayed for 
a month. The main science achieved by this cosmonaut team focused 
on astronomical observations of the Sun and Earth. The station included 
one of the first X-ray cameras to make astronomical observations (which 
can’t be done from Earth), and it discovered a number of celestial 
objects whose X-ray emissions varied with time.
 
✓ Soyuz 18 brought two new crew members, Commander Pyotr Klimuk 
and Flight Engineer Vitali Sevastyanov, in May 1975. They orbited on the 
space station for 63 days, approaching the record set by the American 
Skylab astronauts the previous year. This crew continued the astronomi-
cal observations begun by the previous crew, took pictures of the Sun 
and Earth, and experimented with growing vegetables in space.
A third, unmanned Soyuz spacecraft docked with Salyut 4 for an additional 
few months. The goal of this test was to ensure that the space station could 
remain in orbit for that long with an attached module, in addition to proving 
the increased longevity that the Salyut missions hoped to be capable of.

Part II: The Great Space Race 
Salyut 5: The last military station 
(1976–1977)
Salyut 5 has the distinction of being the last OPS unit launched into orbit. The 
space station left Earth on June 22, 1976; carried out additional military tests; 
and entertained two crews that docked with it in space. Two cosmonauts 
joined Salyut 5 via the Soyuz 21 mission between July and August 1976, and 
the Soyuz 24 spacecraft delivered two cosmonauts in February 1977.
The cosmonauts conducted a variety of military tests and experiments 
aboard the station, including making observations of a Soviet military exer-
cise in Siberia to test the capabilities of the station’s cameras to perform 
reconnaissance.
 
The Soyuz 21 crew, who were scheduled to spend two months on the station, 
had to return early due to the illness of one cosmonaut. Vitali Zholobov devel-
oped both space sickness and psychological problems that could’ve been due 
to the combination of leaking gases on the station and the fact that the crew 
neglected their physical training and sleep schedules. The Soyuz 24 crew, 
which followed, didn’t find any problems with the air on Salyut 5, but the men 
completely changed the cabin air before beginning their stay.

Salyut 6: Undergoing many upgrades 
(1977–1982)
Some of the first major changes of the Salyut program came in 1977 with the 
launch of the DOS-type station Salyut 6. This new design included a second 
docking port and an improved propulsion system. It also included an over-
haul of the space station’s telescopes and an upgrade to its living quarters. 
Salyut 6 could be resupplied via robotic supply ships, which could dock with 
the station automatically to bring aboard fuel and supplies for the crew.
 
Because of these changes, which allowed crews to change hands and supplies 
to be brought to the station more easily, Salyut 6 was a real second-generation 
space station built to be inhabited for years. It also had the most visitors of 
any space station to date. During its nearly five years in orbit, 16 different mis-
sions made their way to the Salyut 6. For the first time, cosmonauts from other 
countries were able to visit a Soviet space station as part of the Soviet Union’s 
new Intercosmos program. In addition to the Soviet Union, visitors to Salyut 
6 hailed from Czechoslovakia, Poland, the German Democratic Republic, 
Hungary, Vietnam, Cuba, Mongolia, and Romania. The dual docking ports 
allowed a long-term crew, with their Soyuz spacecraft docked to one port, to 
receive a shorter-term, visiting crew that could dock at the other port for a 
visit of a few days.

Part II: The Great Space Race 
Salyut 7: Expeditions for repair 
and additions (1982–1986)
The last space station to be launched into orbit under the Salyut program 
was the DOS-type Salyut 7. The main goals of this final expedition were to 
test how long the station could remain operational and to experiment with 
a more modular design for adding future space stations (essentially laying 
the groundwork for the interlocking designs of future missions such as the 
International Space Station, covered in Chapter 19).
 
Part of the reason Salyut 7 was able to operate for so long was the expertise 
brought by its visitors, especially when it came to making essential repairs 
to systems such as a ruptured fuel line. Salyut 7 was ultimately visited by 
ten crews of cosmonauts, including some from India and France. It was also 
briefly home to female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, making her the second 
woman to travel in space and the first to perform a spacewalk. Salyut 7 
endured in space for more than eight years, lasting until after its replacement, 
Mir, was launched. (Flip to Chapter 13 for details on Mir.)
At the end of its lifetime, Salyut 7 was placed in a high orbit to keep it safe 
until the planned Soviet Buran spacecraft could reach it. However, increased 
solar activity caused the station to reenter the Earth’s atmosphere in 1991 
and burn up over Argentina, creating a spectacular meteor shower with many 
fragments reaching the ground.

Apollo-Soyuz: Friends in Space (1975)
The Space Race didn’t end with anything definitive like a closing ceremony 
or medal distribution. Instead, the intense atmosphere of competition 
between the United States and the Soviet Union gradually gave way to a 
wave of unprecedented cooperation. The first great manifestation of this 
new relationship came in the form of the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975 — the 
first time that space vehicles belonging to different nations docked in orbit 
around Earth.
Mission planning
Apollo-Soyuz was considered a test flight that would prove the feasibility of 
a mission combining the American and Soviet space programs. Its official 
designation at NASA was ASTP, short for Apollo Soyuz Test Project. Science 
experiments and equipment were included, but they were really secondary 
to the goal of promoting peace and success between the Space Race 
superpowers.
 
The heart of the mission was the docking of an American Apollo capsule with 
a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft. The plan was to launch an Apollo spacecraft that 
was very much like the ones sent to the Moon along with a Soyuz spacecraft, 
plus a NASA-designed docking module that would allow astronauts and cos-
monauts to move between the two spacecraft. In addition to promoting a 
working relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, scientists wanted 
to test whether the two countries’ space vehicles could play nicely together. If 
so, future internationally supported spaceflights and ventures might be 
possible.

Part II: The Great Space Race 
A docking and a handshake
The Apollo-Soyuz mission made history when Commander Thomas Stafford, 
an American astronaut, and Commander Alexei Leonov, a Soviet cosmonaut, 
performed the first-ever international handshake in space (as shown in Figure 
12-3). Command Module Pilot Vance Brand and Docking Module Pilot Donald 
Slayton comprised the rest of the American crew; Flight Engineer Valeri 
Kubasov was the second half of the Soviet crew. It was a stellar crew on both 
sides, with years of experience and history (in fact, Leonov conducted the 
Soviet Union’s first spacewalk from the Voskhod 2 spacecraft in 1965; see 
Chapter 7 for more details).

After docking for the first time and completing the handshake, the crews 
spent about two days together, using the time to exchange gifts, eat meals 
(American and Soviet space food was about equally “delicious” in the 1970s), 
and float through the other country’s spacecraft. They also practiced rendez-
vousing, docking, and undocking while in orbit.

193
 Chapter 12: The First Space Stations and the End of the Space Race
 
The Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft remained in orbit for several days before 
heading home. This would be the last flight of an Apollo mission and, as histo-
rians would later suggest, the “official” end of the Space Race. Despite a few 
technical difficulties during Apollo-Soyuz, by all accounts the joint mission 
was a magnificent success for both countries. For the first time, Soviets and 
Americans proved they could put aside their past differences and achieve 
monumental greatness — together.

space. Both the United States and the Soviet Union gained 
expertise with longer-duration stays in orbit and performed 
useful scientific and engineering tasks. Robotic exploration 
continued on Mars, which remained a difficult target, and 
within the inner and outer solar system.

hereas the spacecraft of the 1960s and 1970s were primarily single-
use and meant to last for just a few years, the 1980s introduced a 
switch to reusable spacecraft that signified a long-term commitment to space 
exploration.
 
✓ In 1981, the United States sent the first Space Shuttle on its way. With 
its reusable parts, the Space Shuttle was designed to provide low-cost, 
regular access to space.
 
✓ In 1986, the Soviet Union began constructing the Mir space station, 
meant for long-term, constant occupation. A symbol of international 
cooperation, Mir housed astronauts from many different nations who 
spent time doing scientific research and fixing systems on the station.
The new spirit of cooperation that allowed Soviet and American crews to 
train together and the Space Shuttle to dock with Mir truly set the stage for a 
new era of space exploration. We give you the scoop on the beginnings of the 
Space Shuttle program and the Mir space station in this chapter.

Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
The Birth of the American Space 
Shuttle Program
The first flights of the Space Shuttle program (which is technically called 
the Space Transportation System, or STS) began well after the end of Project 
Apollo in 1975. However, the design and engineering work that went into 
the Space Shuttle commenced long before that. As early as 1968, scientists 
were developing plans and specs for a fleet of vehicles that could deliver and 
retrieve payloads (in other words, cargo, such as experiments, equipment, 
and anything else that hitches a ride to or from orbit via the Space Shuttle) in 
space. The Space Shuttle’s original goals were to
 
✓ Be reusable, thereby reducing some of the cost of space exploration
 
✓ Provide a means of encouraging commercial, military, and scientific 
achievements in space
 
The Space Shuttle program became a reality in 1972 when President Richard 
Nixon confirmed that the federal government would support the development 
of a reusable spacecraft that launched like a traditional rocket but landed on a 
runway like a glider. The concept for the Space Shuttle was a clear, three-part 
plan:
 
✓ A winged orbiter, which could be used repeatedly, would house the mis-
sion’s crew. This orbiter would be 122 feet (37 meters) long, 78 feet (24 
meters) wide from wing to wing, and 57 feet (17 meters) high.
 
✓ Reusable solid rocket boosters would help propel the spacecraft into 
space.
 
✓ An external single-use fuel tank would provide propellant for the orbit-
er’s main engines on the trip to space.
By 1976, contractors had developed and started testing the Enterprise, the 
first Space Shuttle orbiter. It lacked engines and heat shields but provided 
enough of the core design to be suitable for glide-landing tests. After the 
concept of glide landing a spacecraft was proven, NASA was able to refine 
the orbiter’s design and build Columbia, the first production Space Shuttle 
(Figure 13-1 shows the Shuttle’s first launch).

The whole STS package consists of the orbiter plus the solid rocket boosters 
and external fuel tank; this configuration at launch is called the “stack.” Yet 
the orbiter is really the guts of the Space Shuttle. It contains the pressurized 
crew cabin (which normally holds up to 7 crew members but can fit up to 10 
in case of emergency), payload bay, engines, and orbital-maneuvering sys-
tems. The orbiter is organized into forward, mid, and aft fuselages, each with 
a different purpose (see Figure 13-2):
 
✓ The forward fuselage contains the crew cabin, cockpit, and operator 
station.
 
✓ The mid fuselage houses the payload bay.
 
✓ The aft (rear) fuselage contains the Shuttle’s engines.
 
As the first partially reusable spacecraft, the Space Shuttle made “green” 
history. After all, space exploration is, in many ways, a history of spending 
billions of dollars on spacecraft that can never be used again. The original 
Space Shuttle plan, on the other hand, intended for each orbiter to survive 
ten launches apiece over the course of ten years, or about 100 total flights. In 
reality, the Space Shuttle fleet as a whole boasted nearly 125 flights as of late 
2008, with each orbiter making between 10 (Challenger) and 35 (Discovery) 
flights over a 27-year period. (Of course, this greatly reduced flight frequency 
resulted in greatly increased preflight costs.)

Welcome Aboard: The Typical Course 
of a Space Shuttle Mission
Don’t think you’re astronaut material? Well, the next few sections are your 
chance to experience a Space Shuttle mission from launch all the way 
through landing. As a virtual passenger on the Space Shuttle, you’re going 
to encounter three major phases of the mission (and configurations of your 
spacecraft):
 
✓ For launch, expect to be strapped into a seat with the Space Shuttle 
standing straight up on its engines, strapped to its boosters and fuel 
tank. After all conditions are safe for launch, the engines and solid 
rocket boosters ignite, leaving you squashed into your seat as you head 
into orbit.
 
✓ Once in orbit, you have time to perform scientific experiments, as well 
as practice your midair acrobatics and gaze out the window at home.
 
✓ Finally, it’s time to strap yourself back into your seat for landing. 
Atmospheric reentry heats up the exterior of the orbiter, but the Space 
Shuttle’s thermal tiles keep the interior (and you!) nice and cool. You 
only have one shot for a landing. Never fear though. Your expert pilot 
lands the spacecraft on the runway like a glider. Welcome back to Earth!

 Chapter 13: The Space Shuttle and Mir Space Station
Surveying the safety requirements 
for launch
Launching something that’s as much of an investment of American time and 
resources as the Space Shuttle calls for some pretty intense safety precau-
tions to protect both the orbiter and its crew. Weather is one of those issues 
that can cause some serious trouble for a Shuttle launch. That’s why you can 
find NASA staff members carefully monitoring the weather nearby Florida’s 
Kennedy Space Center (the official Space Shuttle launch site) on launch days.
In particular, they keep an eye out for storms with lightning. Apollo 12 was 
actually struck by lightning after launch on its way to the Moon, and although 
that mission was able to recover safely, mission controllers don’t want to 
take that risk again! Consequently, launches don’t take place when a potential 
lightning-causing cloud is within 10 nautical miles (18.5 kilometers) of the 
launch site. Weather must also be favorable at one of the abort landing sites 
located around the world, in case something goes wrong during launch.
Aside from positive weather conditions, in order for a Space Shuttle to be 
cleared for launch, it must successfully complete a range of preflight prepara-
tions and checks. All the onboard systems must be tested, and any critical 
problem that results halts the launch countdown.
Safely launching a Space Shuttle also requires being prepared for emergen-
cies, particularly because history has shown that launch and landing are the 
two most dangerous parts of a spaceflight. Consequently, each Space Shuttle 
has five “abort modes” that allow it to safely terminate rather than complete 
its mission. (Want to know more about the Space Shuttle’s abort modes? 
Check out the related sidebar nearby.)
Star Trekking
The first Space Shuttle orbiter was originally 
supposed to be called Constitution, but fans of 
the television show Star Trek staged a massive 
write-in campaign and convinced NASA offi-
cials to rename the orbiter Enterprise. Much 
of the cast of the original Star Trek series was 
on hand when Enterprise was dedicated. You 
can see the Enterprise in person at the new 
Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia, an annex of the 
National Air and Space Museum (www.nasm.
si.edu/museum/udvarhazy).

Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
Launching the Space Shuttle
The Space Shuttle launch sequence proceeds as follows (note that negative 
numbers indicate time before launch and positive numbers indicate time 
after launch):
 
1. At T–9 minutes, an automatic launch hold takes place to make sure 
all systems check out; then the launch continues. The Ground Launch 
Sequencer, a computer program, is in charge of monitoring systems at 
this point.
 
2. At T–31 seconds, the Space Shuttle’s onboard computers take over con-
trol of the launch.
Aborting a Space Shuttle mission
A Space Shuttle doesn’t have to complete its 
mission if it seems like something is wrong. 
Every Space Shuttle mission is designed so 
it can be terminated using one of the follow-
ing five abort modes. The abort modes are 
progressed through sequentially with time 
after launch until the spacecraft successfully 
reaches orbit. Here’s what each abort mode is 
and what it involves:
 ✓ RSLS (Redundant Set Launch Sequencer): 
This is the first abort mode. It can actually 
cancel the entire launch if flight comput-
ers detect an engine failure during the six-
second period before the solid rocket 
boosters (SRBs) ignite. After the SRBs are 
ignited, however, they can’t be turned off 
and the launch must proceed. Five RSLS 
aborts have taken place in the history of 
the Space Shuttle program.
 ✓ RTLS (Return to Launch Site): This second 
abort mode is available after the SRBs have 
burned out, two minutes after launch. The 
orbiter would turn around so that the firing 
main engines slow it down before descend-
ing to land back at Kennedy Space Center. 
This abort mode would involve landing 
about half an hour after takeoff, which is 
very risky. Perhaps that’s why this abort 
mode has never been used.
 ✓ TAL (Transoceanic Abort Landing): This is 
the third abort mode. It would take place if 
the Space Shuttle took off but didn’t have 
enough speed to reach orbit. The orbiter 
would land at a predetermined landing site 
across the Atlantic Ocean, about 25 minutes 
after takeoff. Several TAL sites in countries 
such as France, Spain, and Nigeria are 
always staffed and standing by during a 
Shuttle launch. Like the RTLS abort mode, 
TAL has never been used.
 ✓ AOA (Abort Once Around): This fourth 
abort mode would happen if the Shuttle 
has enough speed to orbit the Earth once 
and then land 90 minutes later. The circum-
stances for this mode are unlikely, and it too 
has never been used.
 ✓ ATO (Abort to Orbit): This fifth and final 
abort mode takes place when the orbiter 
can reach orbit, but at a lower level than 
originally intended. ATO was used in 1985 
on mission STS-51-F, when one of the main 
engines shut down early (the mission was 
still successful despite the lower orbit).

3. At T–16 seconds, hundreds of thousands of gallons of seawater are pumped 
onto the launchpad to help protect both the orbiter and the neighboring 
buildings from the sound waves generated by the rocket thrusters.
 
4. At T–10 seconds, liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen begin to flow into 
the main engines.
 
5. At T–6.6 seconds, the Space Shuttle’s main engines ignite.
 
6. At T–3 seconds, all three engines must have full thrust. (If they don’t, an 
abort mode is signaled.)
 
7. At T–0 seconds, the solid rocket boosters (SRBs) ignite (and can’t be 
turned off). Explosive nuts release the Space Shuttle from the tower, and 
launch occurs.
 
8. At T+126 seconds, explosive bolts release the SRBs from the orbiter. The 
SRBs parachute into the ocean for recovery and reuse; the orbiter heads 
skyward by using its main engines.
 
9. At T+8 minutes, the main engines are shut off when their propellant is 
almost exhausted, and the external fuel tank is detached so it can burn 
up in the atmosphere.
 
10. At T+45 minutes, the Orbital Maneuvering System engines are fired, 
ensuring that the orbiter can reach a stable orbit.
Living and working aboard the Shuttle
 
After reaching orbit, the Space Shuttle begins its mission (which usually lasts 
between 7 and 14 days). Although their most-common purpose these days is 
to bring supplies and payloads (cargo) to and from the International Space 
Station (described in Chapter 19), Space Shuttles are also capable of retriev-
ing satellites from orbit, launching robotic spacecraft, and carrying advanced 
scientific instruments such as telescopes and instruments to map the Earth. 
Their large payload capacity was designed with space station construction in 
mind, but the sizeable payload bay has come in handy for a variety of other 
missions as well. (Check out the color section to see a Shuttle in orbit.)
Van of the stars
Every Shuttle trip starts in a van — the Astrovan, 
that is. All Space Shuttle crews since 1984 have 
hitched a ride to the launchpad on the Astrovan. 
This NASA vehicle, essentially a modified motor 
home, transports the astronauts from their 
preflight housing out to the launchpad. The 
Astrovan has held up remarkably well despite its 
more than 20 years of NASA driving experience, 
mostly because it’s only used for transporting 
astronauts to and from launches. It’s specially 
designed to accommodate the astronauts in 
their launch suits.

204
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
The crew compartment is the main place where the astronauts live and work. 
It’s separated into a flight deck, complete with navigational systems; a mid-
deck with a galley, bunks, and exercise equipment; and a lower deck with a 
life-support system. The life-support system turns the Space Shuttle into an 
environment suitable for humans. It provides breathable air, drinkable water, 
food, electrical power, waste removal, temperature control, and a host of 
other essential functions. The Shuttle is also equipped with a communication 
system that allows the astronauts to talk with flight controllers back home.
Although much of the astronauts’ time is taken up by required tasks, flight 
controllers make sure that they also get some scheduled relaxation time 
each day. Most astronauts find that looking out the windows at the Earth and 
taking pictures is one of their favorite ways to spend free time. Sunrises and 
sunsets are also beautiful to watch, and because they occur every 45 minutes 
in orbit, there are plenty of them! Astronauts also have time to read, exercise, 
and practice their acrobatics in microgravity.
 
If a particular Shuttle mission involves retrieving or deploying a satellite, 
or even deploying payloads into orbit, the astronauts use a tool called the 
Remote Manipulator System (RMS). This robotic arm is equipped with a 
camera and can be controlled from the flight deck; it can pick up and release 
payloads from the Shuttle’s payload bay. Most current uses for the RMS 
involve the installation of modules and components on the International Space 
Station. The RMS also serves as an important safety device for inspecting the 
Shuttle’s thermal tiles for damage after liftoff.
Landing 101
The first part of coming home from a Space Shuttle mission involves reenter-
ing the Earth’s atmosphere. During this journey, friction from the air heats up 
the outer surface of the Shuttle to more than 2,732 degrees Fahrenheit (1,500 
degrees Celsius). The Shuttle’s thermal tiles keep the orbiter and the astro-
nauts safe and sound, though the fragility of this system was shown when 
Space Shuttle Columbia exploded during reentry in 2003 due to heat shield 
damage caused during launch (see Chapter 5 for details).
 
One major technological innovation of the Space Shuttle is its ability to return 
to Earth via the ground rather than the ocean. Unlike earlier American space-
craft that could land only by splashing down in the water, the Shuttle can 
leave Earth orbit and reenter the atmosphere on a carefully calculated trajec-
tory that brings it to its landing site.
Computer programs control most aspects of the Space Shuttle’s landing, 
though the pilot can land the spacecraft manually if necessary (for example, if 
a computer problem arises during reentry). However, the final approach and 
runway landing is usually done under manual control because the well-trained 
Space Shuttle pilots can land the Shuttle better than the computer can.

205
 Chapter 13: The Space Shuttle and Mir Space Station
 
Regardless of who or what controls the landing process, the astronauts 
onboard the Space Shuttle have only one chance to land the spacecraft cor-
rectly — they can’t circle around and try again because the orbiter doesn’t 
have its own jet engines. And if you ever want a challenge, just try landing one 
of these puppies! In addition to having no propulsion source of its own during 
landing, the aerodynamics of the Shuttle are designed to help get rid of as 
much speed as possible before landing, unlike a conventional aircraft that’s 
designed to stay aloft. That means the Shuttle basically returns to Earth in a 
barely controlled fall through the sky, requiring a skillful pilot to guide it to a 
safe landing. And although the pilot does have basic control over the orbiter’s 
orientation, flying the spacecraft through the atmosphere is said to be similar 
to flying a brick!
As the Shuttle approaches the runway, it first deploys its landing gear. As the 
wheels touch down, the spacecraft then deploys a parachute to slow itself to 
a stop (see Figure 13-3).

Shuttle uses

Although the Shuttle tries to land at Kennedy Space Center, weather condi-
tions can force a landing at an alternate site. Out of the more than 20 such 
alternate Shuttle landing sites around the world, the two that have been used 
are Edwards Air Force Base in Southern California (49 landings) and White 
Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico (1 landing). If an alternate landing site 
becomes necessary, the Space Shuttle has to be attached to a Shuttle Carrier 
Aircraft and flown back home to Florida, because it has neither the means to 
take off under its own power nor engines that can let it fly in an atmosphere. 
NASA prefers to have the Shuttle land at Kennedy Space Center, because it 
costs time and money ($1.7 million to be exact) to transport it back from an 
alternate landing site. Seems funny to think that something as grand as the 
Space Shuttle has to hitch a ride back home, huh?

Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
The Early Days of the Space 
Shuttle Program
After the excitement of the Apollo Moon landings (Chapters 9 and 10) and 
the first American space station (Chapter 12), interest in space exploration 
waned in the U.S. Without the Cold War as a backdrop, NASA had to find its 
own justification for existence.
Enter the Space Shuttle. The futuristic design of this innovative spacecraft 
reinvigorated public interest in the space program, and NASA played up the 
idea of cheap, frequent, reusable access to space. Americans were justifiably 
proud of their new space vehicle, which was touted as able to make all sorts 
of scientific discoveries that could make life back on Earth better.
The following sections introduce you to the Space Shuttle fleet and highlight 
some of the most-notable achievements of the young Space Shuttle program. 
(Check out Chapter 14 for details on prime Shuttle missions of the late 1980s 
through the early 21st century.)
The orbiter fleet
Once upon a time, the U.S. Space Shuttle program consisted of a fleet of five 
vehicles (all of which are listed in Table 13-1). The first two (Columbia and 
Challenger) are no longer operational due to devastating explosions (flip 
to Chapter 5 for the details). The remaining three are the Space Shuttles 
Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour. (Another vehicle, the Enterprise, was cre-
ated for ground-landing test purposes and turned out to be too expensive to 
retrofit for spaceflight.)

 Chapter 13: The Space Shuttle and Mir Space Station
Columbia and Challenger were the first two Space Shuttles to reach orbit 
(their notable achievements are described later in this chapter); Discovery 
was the third Shuttle to take flight. Lessons learned from the design of 
the first two orbiters allowed Discovery to be almost 7,000 pounds (3,175 
kilograms) lighter than Columbia. On its maiden voyage in 1984, Discovery 
deployed a series of three communications satellites. Sixteen years later, 
Discovery was responsible for two rather notable missions:
 
✓ Deploying the Hubble Space Telescope
 
✓ Launching the solar explorer Ulysses
Atlantis took flight after Discovery and featured a number of improvements 
over its predecessors. For example, it was much quicker to build than 
Discovery because the thermal tiles were redesigned and their application 
became much faster as a result. Atlantis’s big claim to fame is that it was the 
first Space Shuttle to successfully dock with Mir, the Russian space station 
(which we cover in detail later in this chapter).
Intended as a replacement for Challenger, Endeavour was the last Space 
Shuttle to join the fleet of orbiters. It pioneered a number of new features, 
including a drag chute to aid the Shuttle’s glide landing, changes to the steer-
ing system, and an increased payload capacity. Endeavour’s most-notable 
accomplishment to date is that it supported the longest spacewalk (the more-
common term for an extravehicular activity, or EVA, performed in space) in 
history (eight hours) during its first spaceflight.
The first flight: Columbia (1981)
The first Space Shuttle to take flight was Columbia during the 1981 STS-1 mission.
STS-1 was essentially a test flight designed to ensure that all instruments, com-
ponents, and life-support systems aboard the Space Shuttle were fully functional 
and ready for duty. During this no-pressure, decide-the-fate-of-the-entire-Space-
Shuttle-program flight, Commander John Young and Pilot Robert Crippen 
proved that the Space Shuttle could be successfully orbited and returned to 
Earth. The mission was therefore deemed a success even though it uncovered 
a problem (specifically, damage to the heat-resistant tiling covering the 
spacecraft) that would have significant impact on future flights. Following the 
flight, changes were made to the way the launchpad was flooded with water at
takeoff to absorb sound waves, resulting in far less tile damage on future flights.
 
Shuttle flights are usually numbered sequentially (though a numbering change 
employed for a few years in the mid-1980s used numbers and letters to designate 
the year, launch site, and flight number) and start with the STS designation (for 
Space Transportation System, the official name of the Space Shuttle program and 
also the official term for the combination of the orbiter, solid rocket boosters, 
and external fuel tank at launch). Missions sometimes fly out of sequential order 
due to changes in targets, training or equipment problems, or other issues.

208
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
Sally Ride, the first American woman in 
space (1983)
 
Among the Space Shuttle program’s notable “firsts” was bringing America’s 
first female astronaut into space. Sally Ride joined NASA’s astronaut program 
in 1977 and spent years undergoing the various types of flight, survival, and 
navigation training required for astronauts. In 1983, she made history with her 
first spaceflight aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger (mission STS-7).
During their six days in space aboard Challenger, Ride and four other astro-
nauts (Robert Crippen, Frederick Hauck, John Fabian, and Norman Thagard) 
became, at the time, the largest crew to travel in space. The astronauts 
deployed communications satellites while in orbit and performed a range of 
experiments in microgravity. Dr. Ride went on to fly on other Space Shuttle 
missions for a total of more than 340 hours in space. She was also one of the 
astronauts assigned to research the Challenger disaster of 1986.
Notable early missions
Although each of the early Space Shuttle missions was significant, several 
from the 1980s stand out:
 
✓ STS-5: The fifth mission of Space Shuttle Columbia was the first fully 
operational flight of the Space Shuttle program (previous flights were 
designated test flights). Launching on November 11, 1982, the STS-5 mis-
sion sent four astronauts into space, the largest crew up to that point. 
The flight deployed two communications satellites, which were the first 
commercial satellites to be flown on the Space Shuttle.
 
✓ STS-6: Launched on April 4, 1983, with a crew of four, STS-6 was the first 
flight of Space Shuttle Challenger. Two astronauts performed the first 
spacewalk of the Shuttle program, testing out new spacesuits.
Fast facts about STS-1
Following are the basic facts about the STS-1 
mission:
 ✓ Launch date and site: April 12, 1981; 
Kennedy Space Center, Florida
 ✓ Spacecraft name and mass at launch: Space 
Shuttle Columbia; 219,258 lb (99,453 kg)
 ✓ Size of crew: 2 astronauts
 ✓ Number of Earth orbits: 36
 ✓ Mission duration: 2 days, 6 hours, 20 min-
utes, 53 seconds

209
 Chapter 13: The Space Shuttle and Mir Space Station
 
✓ STS-41-D: Launched on August 30, 1984, STS-41-D was the 12th flight 
of the Shuttle program and the first flight of Discovery. The crew of six 
astronauts included the first payload specialist (someone who isn’t an 
official NASA astronaut; see Chapter 4 for more on this position), an 
employee of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
 
✓ STS-51-J: This 21st flight of the Shuttle program (and first flight of 
Atlantis) launched on October 3, 1985. The crew of five astronauts per-
formed a classified mission for the U.S. Department of Defense.
Unfortunately, NASA soon ran into the problem that there was only so much 
that could be done in Earth orbit to capture the interest of the American 
public. In fact, by the mid-1980s, Space Shuttle launches had become routine 
as Americans were lulled into a false sense of invulnerability due to the lack 
of major disasters in the space program. The Teacher in Space program was 
designed to reinterest the public in the space program, and ironically the 
1986 launch of Challenger drew a much larger viewing audience than previous 
flights. Unfortunately, the flight ended in tragedy just over a minute after it 
began (as we explain in Chapter 5).
Mir, the Soviet/Russian Space Station 
(1986–2001)
Following the achievements of the Salyut space station program (see Chapter 
12 for details), Soviet space research turned toward the creation of a more 
modular space station design that could accommodate more research labs, 
house more cosmonauts, and boast more-sophisticated capabilities. The space 
stations of the Salyut program were meant as one-shots, single modules to be 
visited by crews over the course of a few years, but not as permanent outposts 
in orbit. The many lessons learned and experiences gained from this series of 
stations made the Soviet Union the clear leader in long-term orbital missions.
 
Still smarting from the failure of their lunar exploration program, and faced with 
the futuristic Space Shuttle program from NASA, the Soviets saw the develop-
ment of a long-term, modular space station as a clear way to meet both political 
and technical goals while boosting the space exploration profile of their country. 
The Mir program was developed, starting in 1976, to meet these goals. Ten years 
later, the station was launched into orbit. The Mir (which stands for “peace” in 
Russian) space station was a grand success that enhanced the reputation of the 
Soviet space program. Its existence also played a fundamental role in creating 
a new era of cooperation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union — cooperation 
that culminated with missions in which the Space Shuttle docked at Mir.
In the following sections, we describe the construction of Mir’s modules, the 
collaboration of American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts, work and life 
on Mir, and the end of the Mir program.

210
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
Building Mir, module by module
The basic design of the Mir space station focused on modules that were 
launched into orbit and attached together in space. The Core Module, which 
went up first in 1986, held the station’s control center as well as living space 
for the cosmonauts. As more Mir modules were prepared and ready to go on 
the ground (see Table 13-2), other teams of cosmonauts launched and pre-
pared the space station to accept its new arrivals.

Because existing rockets had limits in terms of how big and how heavy their 
payloads could be, this modular approach to space station construction 
allowed for Mir to be much bigger than previous stations. Additionally, it was 
much cheaper to launch individual completed modules one at a time. Some 
of these modules could automatically dock with each other, whereas others 
were attached together by cosmonauts during spacewalks.

211
 Chapter 13: The Space Shuttle and Mir Space Station
 
Because the launch of the station itself was something of a rush job due to 
political deadlines, a lot of work was left to be done in orbit to get Mir up 
and running. The first cosmonauts to reach Mir, Leonid Kizim and Vladimir 
Solovyov, got a ride on the Soyuz T-15 mission in March 1986, which remained 
with Mir for about 50 days before taking a trip to the older Salyut 7 space sta-
tion, which was still in orbit. While inside Mir, Kizim and Solovyov helped set 
up the new space station and performed a number of experiments. Future mis-
sions brought more cosmonauts to Mir, where they were able to make repairs 
and do science as needed.
Welcoming American astronauts
With the fall of the former Soviet Union in 1991 (and subsequent end of 
the Cold War), a new era of cooperation was suddenly possible between 
Americans and Russians. Joint space missions once again became a way to 
meet the two superpowers’ political and scientific goals. As a way of discov-
ering more about the business of constructing modular space stations, the 
U.S. became involved with the Mir project, sending both supplies and astro-
nauts to the now-Russian space station.
The Soviet shuttle that never took astronauts to space
With all their space station expertise, did the 
Soviets ever develop their own version of the 
Space Shuttle? The answer, perhaps surpris-
ingly, is yes, although it never brought cosmo-
nauts into space. The Buran program was the 
Soviet Union’s answer to the American Space 
Shuttle. A reusable spacecraft that looked very 
similar to the NASA vehicle, the Buran had a 
few important differences:
 ✓ Although it launched like a rocket, the 
Buran was carried into orbit as payload on 
the large Energia rocket because it didn’t 
have its own rocket engines.
 ✓ It could be flown completely automati-
cally. The lack of a need for a human crew 
removed the necessity of a hair-raising first 
human flight of an untested spacecraft.
Five Burans were commissioned, but only 
one was ever deemed spaceworthy. The sole 
launch of the Buran program took place on 
November 15, 1988. The Buran spacecraft, with 
its life-support system and computer displays 
only partially completed, successfully launched 
into orbit, circled the Earth twice in just over 
three hours, and then made a completely auto-
mated landing on a runway at the Baikonur 
Cosmodrome. All seemed well until the Soviets 
realized the spacecraft had suffered damage to 
its thermal protection tiles during the flight — 
damage that would’ve been costly to fix.
Due to political circumstances in the soon-
to-collapse Soviet Union, the project was ini-
tially put on hold before being canceled by the 
Russian government in 1993. No other Buran 
flights ever occurred.

212
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
 
In order for the Americans to contribute resources and astronauts to the Mir 
program, the Space Shuttle had to get involved. This exchange was conducted 
through the Shuttle-Mir program, which was also seen as the predecessor to 
the International Space Station (then in the planning stages). As part of the 
Shuttle-Mir program, a series of 11 Shuttle missions docked with Mir between 
1994 and 1998. One of these missions launched an American astronaut into 
space in a Soyuz spacecraft and a Russian cosmonaut into space on the Space 
Shuttle. (Figure 13-4 shows the Space Shuttle Atlantis docked with Mir.)

(4,592 of which were occupied)

213
 Chapter 13: The Space Shuttle and Mir Space Station
The new era of cooperation in space began in 1994 with the STS-60 mission of 
Space Shuttle Discovery, which brought Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev into 
space and included audio and video conversations with the Mir crew. In 1995, 
Discovery performed a rendezvous with Mir that included a close approach and 
a flight around the station as a dress rehearsal for an actual docking.
From 1996 through 1998, Mir was home to astronauts and cosmonauts working 
together to perform numerous tests and spacewalks. The astronauts also had a 
chance to test out the Russian spacesuits and equipment (and vice versa).
Discovering how Mir residents 
spent their time
Daily life on Mir involved a combination of work, play, and exercise. 
Cosmonauts wore lightweight flight suits while they moved between the 
different modules, which connected together via nodes. As with any space 
station, the cosmonauts floated rather than walked to work; they also had to 
keep a close grip on portable equipment as they moved about during the day. 
(Check out the quarters on Mir in Figure 13-5.)

Adjusting to weightlessness is one of the challenges faced by anyone who 
spends time in space. Mir residents were still able to brush their teeth, use the 
bathroom, shave, and perform most of the other basic functions that they did 

214
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
on Earth, but they had to do so rather differently (darn that lack of gravity). 
The station’s zero-gravity space toilet, for example, used a hose with flexible 
tubing; each person aboard Mir was given his or her own funnel to use.
Astronauts and cosmonauts conducted significant experiments aboard Mir. 
Many were geared toward helping scientists understand more about how 
people and plants can live and function in the microgravity environment of 
space. Mir cosmonauts also performed astronomical observations and stud-
ied the Earth from orbit.
As the Mir space station aged, cosmonauts had to spend more and more time 
repairing it. In fact, on a typical mission with a mixed crew of three people, the 
two Russian cosmonauts devoted most of their time to space station mainte-
nance while the American astronaut performed scientific experiments. The 
cosmonauts’ quick-thinking abilities were put to the test on two occasions:
 
✓ On February 23, 1997, a small fire broke out in one of the modules due 
to a malfunctioning oxygen generator. The crew aboard Mir was able to 
quickly extinguish the flames, which did minor damage to nearby 
equipment.
 
✓ On June 25, 1997, a robotic supply ship crashed into one of Mir’s solar 
panels while attempting to dock with the station. The collision resulted 
in a puncture to the hull of the struck module, which quickly lost pres-
sure and had to be sealed off from the rest of the station to avoid a 
stationwide pressure loss. Partial power was eventually restored to Mir 
from the damaged module’s solar panels thanks to a series of space-
walks, but the module couldn’t be fixed and was left depressurized.
Observing the end of an era
 
After almost ten years of continual habitation, the last crews left Mir in mid-
1999. A brief, privately funded mission returned to the Russian space station 
in 2000 to try to salvage it as a commercial enterprise of some sort, but to no 
avail. With the Russian Federal Space Agency turning its support to develop-
ing the new International Space Station, Mir’s long lifetime was officially over.
Flight controllers allowed Mir’s orbit to decay as the drag of Earth’s atmo-
sphere gradually slowed it down. Robotic supply ships brought extra fuel to 
the station and then used their engines to bring it into an orbit that would 
intersect with Earth’s atmosphere in a controlled way to ensure that most of 
the station burned up and the remnants fell harmlessly into the ocean.
The return of the 135-ton space station to Earth in March 2001 was visible 
with the naked eye. Observers reported seeing a bluish flare, followed closely 
by a sonic boom as the space station reentered the atmosphere. Mir com-
pletely broke apart upon reentry, as expected, and dropped into the Pacific 
Ocean off the coast of Australia.

Prime Time for the Space Shuttle: 
From the 1980s into the 
21st Century
In This Chapter
▶ Shuttling major missions into space
▶ Conducting experiments in space
T
he Space Shuttle, as you find out in this chapter, became a showpiece of 
the American space program in the 1980s and continued its flights through 
the 1990s and into the early 21st century. During this time, the Space Shuttle 
launched interplanetary spacecraft such as Galileo and satellites such as the 
Hubble Space Telescope. The Shuttle astronauts also performed a wide variety 
of science experiments from space; examples include growing crystals in very 
low gravity and taking detailed topographic maps of the Earth.
 
The Space Shuttle program is slated for retirement in 2010. Its final few 
years of missions will be devoted almost entirely to helping complete the 
International Space Station (described in Chapter 19), with a single mission 
planned to repair and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope one last time. The 
Space Shuttle is scheduled to be replaced by the Orion series of spacecraft, an 
Apollo-style, capsule-based design that we tell you about in Chapter 21.

from the Space Shuttle
In addition to its success as a new-and-improved vehicle for human space 
exploration, the Space Shuttle was also used as a launch platform for a 
variety of massive robotic space missions. Some of the most important mis-
sions launched from the Space Shuttle include the Galileo spacecraft and the 
Hubble Space Telescope.

Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
Atlantis gives Galileo a lift (1989)
Although the Space Shuttle had many historic launches, one notable mission 
was STS-34, otherwise known as the mission that sent the robotic spacecraft 
Galileo into orbit. This probe, launched in October 1989 aboard Space Shuttle 
Atlantis, was designed to photograph and study Jupiter and its moons (a 
combination called the Jovian system).
 
Here’s a fun bit of trivia for you: Galileo was actually ready to go before 
Atlantis was! Because of the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion in 1986 (see 
Chapter 5), the Galileo spacecraft sat — fully assembled, no less — in a 
warehouse for more than two years before the Space Shuttle program finally 
returned to flight.
Galileo was designed to fit inside the Space Shuttle’s payload bay, making it 
the main payload for mission STS-34. But in order to fit inside the payload 
bay, the probe’s main antenna had to be folded like an umbrella. Although 
Galileo was successfully launched from the Space Shuttle, when engineers 
went to open the antenna, they found that one of the ribs had become stuck 
during the probe’s long storage period. Because the main antenna was unable 
to open fully, the amount of data the Galileo spacecraft could return to Earth 
was severely limited (although the mission was still considered a success, as 
you can read about in Chapter 17).
Discovery launches the Hubble 
Space Telescope (1990)
One of the most-amazing objects launched into space by the Space Shuttle 
was the Hubble Space Telescope. A giant optical telescope sized to fill the 
Shuttle’s payload bay, the Hubble is currently the largest space telescope of 
its kind. It was designed via a massive international collaboration between 
the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA.
Fast facts about STS-34
Following are the basics facts about the STS-34 
mission:
 ✓ Launch date and site: October 18, 1989; 
Kennedy Space Center, Florida
 ✓ Spacecraft name and mass at launch: Space 
Shuttle Atlantis; 257,568 lb (116,831 kg)
 ✓ Size of crew: 5 astronauts
 ✓ Number of Earth orbits: 79
 ✓ Mission duration: 4 days, 23 hours, 39 min-
utes, 20 seconds

217
 Chapter 14: Prime Time for the Space Shuttle
Like Galileo (which we describe in the preceding section), Hubble had to 
wait its turn for launch in the aftermath of the 1986 Challenger disaster. In 
April 1990, mission STS-31 finally received the green light to fly (changes in 
the launch schedule caused STS-31 to end up flying later than STS-34, which 
launched Galileo), and Space Shuttle Discovery deployed Hubble.
 
To make sure it was completely free of the interfering effects of Earth’s atmo-
sphere, Hubble needed to be placed in an orbit high above Earth. To achieve 
this feat, Discovery had to reach a higher altitude than any Space Shuttle had 
reached before. As a result, astronauts were able to take both still photo-
graphs and IMAX movies of the Earth from this high orbit.
Hubble was designed to be upgraded and serviced by future Space Shuttle 
missions, and this design capability proved fortunate when the telescope’s 
primary mirror was discovered to be misshapen, resulting in blurry images. 
Astronauts were able to restore Hubble to crystal-clear imaging capability 
during a marathon servicing mission, and they’ve visited the telescope for 
subsequent upgrades as well (see Chapter 18 for more info).
Other notable launches
From the late 1980s through the 1990s, the Space Shuttle had a number of 
other important missions to launch spacecraft, telescopes, and space station 
supplies. Missions flown during this time period include the following:
 
✓ STS-30: Space Shuttle Atlantis launched the Magellan spacecraft on May 
4, 1989, so it could begin its voyage to Venus (which we describe in 
Chapter 16). This was the first launch of an interplanetary space probe 
by the Space Shuttle.
Fast facts about STS-31
Following are the basics facts about the STS-31 
mission:
 ✓ Launch date and site: April 24, 1990; 
Kennedy Space Center, Florida
 ✓ Spacecraft name and mass at launch: Space 
Shuttle Discovery; 259,233 lb (117,586 kg)
 ✓ Size of crew: 5 astronauts
 ✓ Number of Earth orbits: 80
 ✓ Mission duration: 5 days, 1 hour, 16 min-
utes, 6 seconds

218
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
 
✓ STS-41: On October 6, 1990, Space Shuttle Discovery launched the 
Ulysses spacecraft, which used a flyby of Jupiter to skew its orbit out of 
the flat plane of the solar system so it could enter an orbit that takes it 
over the poles of the Sun. Ulysses was jointly built by NASA and ESA. It’s 
still studying the Sun’s magnetic field.
 
 You can visit either of these Web sites to find out more about the amaz-
ing discoveries made by the Ulysses spacecraft:
 
• ulysses.jpl.nasa.gov
 
• ulysses-ops.jpl.esa.int
 
✓ STS-37: Space Shuttle Atlantis launched the Compton Gamma Ray 
Observatory on April 5, 1991. This telescope was designed to observe 
strange high-energy outbursts from distant stars and galaxies (as 
explained in Chapter 18). It remained in low Earth orbit until 2000.
 
✓ STS-49: On May 7, 1992, Space Shuttle Endeavour took its first flight with 
a powerhouse crew of seven astronauts. Even though the Space Shuttle 
wasn’t really intended to retrieve errant satellites, spacewalking astro-
nauts succeeded in fetching the Intelsat VI from low Earth orbit, attach-
ing it to a new motor, and relaunching it into the correct orbit. In the 
process, this mission supported the world’s first three-person simulta-
neous spacewalk (an extravehicular activity [EVA] done in space), as well 
as the longest spacewalk at the time (8 hours and 29 minutes).
 
✓ Between 1994 and 1998, 11 separate Space Shuttle missions docked with 
the Mir space station to bring crews and supplies. (Chapter 13 has full 
details on Mir.)
 
✓ Beginning in 1998, the Space Shuttle’s main purpose became the con-
struction of the International Space Station (ISS). This multinational 
station couldn’t have been built without the Shuttle’s capability of lifting 
large payloads (cargo, such as the various modules that make up the ISS) 
into orbit. (Flip to Chapter 19 for the scoop on the ISS.)
 
✓ STS-93: On July 23, 1999, Space Shuttle Columbia launched the Chandra 
X-Ray Observatory, a telescope that orbits the Earth and makes images 
of the sky using high-energy X-rays, which are absorbed by the Earth’s 
atmosphere and can’t be observed from the ground. This telescope is 
still successfully collecting data (see Chapter 18).
The Space Shuttle has also been used to launch a series of tracking and data-
relay satellites, which are communication satellites that NASA uses to talk to 
the Shuttle and the ISS. Five of these essential satellites were successfully 
launched on Space Shuttle missions between 1988 and 1995.

219
 Chapter 14: Prime Time for the Space Shuttle
 
Some Shuttle missions have been classified, such as those used for launching 
U.S. Department of Defense satellites. The Shuttle has also launched satellites 
that were part of the Defense Satellite Communications System.
Doing Science aboard the Space Shuttle
The Space Shuttle wasn’t just a tool for ferrying around astronauts, satellites, 
space probes, and supplies. It was also a unique opportunity for doing sci-
ence in space. Toward that end, NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), 
in the 1980s, committed to developing a mobile laboratory, Spacelab, that 
could function inside the Space Shuttle.
Spacelab provided a platform for collaboration between the United States 
and Europe, considering the first entire laboratory module was provided by 
ESA, as were later components. Astronauts from several different countries 
eventually conducted research and experiments within Spacelab.
Other science payloads aboard the Space Shuttle involved astronomical and 
remote sensing equipment that could be used by astronauts to study the 
stars, the growth of materials in space, or the Earth.
Spacelab (1983–2000)
The basic organization of Spacelab (the Space Shuttle’s laboratory module — 
not to be confused with the space station Skylab, which we cover in Chapter 
12) revolved around differing configurations of modules and pallets in the 
Space Shuttle’s payload bay. What’s the difference?
 
✓ Modules were pressurized to allow the astronauts to do their work.
 
✓ Pallets contained the large, remotely operated equipment, such as 
large telescopes, that had to have a direct output into space. Pallets 
were moveable, nonpressurized segments, so they couldn’t be used for 
human work without a spacewalk.
Spacelab modules and pallets could be customized to accommodate the 
research planned for a particular mission (see Figure 14-1). Each overall 
module consisted of a core module, an experiments module, and between 
one and three pallets, depending on the mission and its configuration. Access 
tunnels and adapters were also included for astronauts to enter and leave 
Spacelab from the crew cabin on the Space Shuttle’s flight deck. Much like 
the reusable Space Shuttle orbiter, Spacelab could be brought back to Earth 
after its mission was completed and reconfigured to support research objec-
tives on a future mission.

The first Spacelab, Spacelab 1, was launched aboard Space Shuttle 
Columbia’s STS-9 mission in November 1983. All in all, 25 Space Shuttle mis-
sions launched with Spacelab components. The final flight with a Spacelab 
element was STS-99, aboard Space Shuttle Endeavour in February 2000.
 
Spacelab was a proving ground, in a sense, for the Space Shuttle’s scientific 
capabilities. Numerous experiments were conducted within Spacelab in areas 
of biology, crystallography, and, of course, astronomy. In addition, Spacelab 
proved that real science could be done in microgravity (an area with a very 
small gravitational force), knowledge that proved immensely useful for future 
work and research.
 
Spacelab also broke new ground in that it was a hands-on experience for 
the astronauts. Previously, most science in space was conducted remotely 
through ground-operated instruments. But thanks to Spacelab, payload spe-
cialists, who were experts in their scientific fields, were specifically trained to 
become scientist-astronauts. Spacelab was thus a place where scientists could 
conduct their own experiments and study the resulting data, in addition to 
fixing broken equipment and otherwise supporting ongoing research.
U.S. Microgravity Payloads 
(1992–1997)
Space Shuttle missions of the 1990s offered the opportunity to test the effects 
of microgravity. Astronauts in orbit experience weightlessness because 
they’re in free-fall as they move around the Earth, but some slight gravita-
tional effects, dubbed microgravity, still exist due to the gravitational attrac-
tion of objects to each other and to the Space Shuttle itself. These effects 
can’t be tested on Earth, so they must be tested in space.

221
 Chapter 14: Prime Time for the Space Shuttle
Science-heavy payloads known as the U.S. Microgravity Payloads were 
deployed on specific Shuttle flights from 1992 through 1997. These payloads 
consisted of a series of experiments that studied things like material proper-
ties, combustion, and the physical behavior of fluids, all under microgravity 
conditions. These experiments have had impacts on both fundamental sci-
ence and commercial applications.
 
One interesting experiment type studied the growth of crystalline structures 
in microgravity. It found that without the pull of gravity, these structures can 
develop intricate formations that help scientists learn about the theoretical 
basis of crystal growth under ideal conditions. Such crystals also have impor-
tant commercial possibilities. For example, large, uniform, pure-protein crys-
tals can be grown in space and studied by pharmaceutical companies back on 
Earth to reveal fine structural details. This information could help scientists 
understand how these proteins interact with the human immune system so 
they can use this information to design more-effective medicines to save lives.
The Wake Shield Facility (1994–1996)
The Wake Shield Facility (WSF), a large disk that measured 12 feet (3.7 
meters) in diameter, was a stand-alone scientific research payload designed 
to study materials grown in the conditions of pure vacuum. The Space 
Shuttle launched it into space three times during missions in the mid-1990s. 
The Shuttle released the WSF into space independently before retrieving it 
a few days later. With the help of the Shuttle’s robotic arm, the WSF then 
flew behind the spacecraft to take advantage of the vacuum that exists in the 
Shuttle’s wake.
The Space Shuttle actually deflects most of the remnants of Earth’s atmo-
sphere that exist at the 186-mile (300-kilometer) mark above the planet. The 
design of the WSF served to deflect any remaining particles, creating a near-
perfect vacuum environment. The WSF used this vacuum to grow thin films 
of material. Materials grown on the WSF included crystalline semiconductor 
thin films. Such materials science research has helped the semiconductor 
industry develop better computer chips and improve other devices, such as 
photocells.
The Shuttle Radar Topography 
Mission (2000)
The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) had a lofty goal: to produce 
three-dimensional maps of the Earth at a very high resolution. The project 
consisted of a science payload launched on mission STS-99, aboard Space 
Shuttle Endeavour in 2000, and it used radar mapping to gather topographic 
data over 80 percent of the Earth’s surface.

222
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
To accomplish this goal, two radar antennae were located in different parts 
of the Space Shuttle: one was in the payload bay, and another extended out 
from the Shuttle on a long mast (see Figure 14-2). Radar signals went out 
from the two antennae, bounced off the Earth’s surface, and then returned to 
space where they were detected again by the antennae. By carefully correlat-
ing the differences in how these signals returned to the two separated anten-
nae, computer algorithms could use this data to determine the height of the 
surface under the radar, resulting in maps that show not only shapes of sur-
face features but also their altitudes. This data could later be pieced together 
and composited into global maps.

The SRTM mission was important because it created the best high-resolution 
topographic mapping of the Earth that had ever been done (see the color sec-
tion for an example). This information gave scientists critical data on how high 
mountains, continents, and other features of the Earth really were, as opposed 
to their previous best ground-based estimates. Knowing the absolute heights 
of various geologic features is crucial to understanding the geophysics related 
to their formation and subsurface structure.

Successes and Failures 
in Mars Exploration
In This Chapter
▶ Failing to succeed: The Phobos spacecraft and Mars Observer
▶ Catching a break with Mars Pathfinder and Mars Global Surveyor
▶ Encountering problems with Mars 96, Mars Climate Orbiter, and Mars Polar Lander
R
obotic exploration of Mars took a long hiatus following the failure 
of NASA’s 1976 Viking missions to detect life, although not for lack 
of trying. The Soviet Union’s Phobos spacecraft failed due to computer 
glitches in the late 1980s, and the United States’ Mars Observer spacecraft 
was lost in the early 1990s, further depressing the status of NASA’s planetary 
exploration program. Then at long last came the Mars Pathfinder mission 
(1996–1997), which used the emerging Internet to capture the imagination of 
Americans. This successful NASA mission was closely followed by the Mars 
Global Surveyor orbiter. Despite the loss of two other NASA missions and one 
Russian mission, the 1990s, as you find out in this chapter, were marked by a 
string of successful missions that revolutionized society’s view of Mars.
Stumbles on the Road to Mars
By many accounts, early exploration of Mars courtesy of the United States’ 
Viking missions was, in some ways, almost too successful. The orbiters pro-
duced amazing maps of the surface, and the landers made soil measurements 
and watched the seasons change. Additionally, all components of Viking were 
incredibly durable, lasting for years beyond their expected lifetime. However, 
the Viking missions (which you can read about in Chapter 11) had failed 
where it really counted: finding life on Mars.

224
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
Despite the Viking landers’ suites of instruments specifically designed to look 
for signs of life, nothing was sent back to Earth to indicate life exists on Mars. 
If the idea of potential life on Mars had excited the public worldwide, the 
Viking missions’ negative results definitely soured public support for future 
Mars exploration. Building scientific and political momentum for a new crop 
of Mars missions took time, and those plans suffered further setbacks from 
a series of failed Soviet efforts in the late 1980s and disappointing American 
attempts in the early 1990s.
Computer failures for Phobos 1 and 2 
(1988–1989)
Renewed exploration of the Red Planet didn’t start out well. In fact, the con-
cept of Murphy’s Law comes to mind. . . . The first post-Viking Mars missions 
were a pair of ambitious spacecraft developed by the Soviet Union. As part of 
the Phobos program, the Soviets sent a pair of robotic spacecraft, Phobos 1 
and Phobos 2, to Mars to study both the planet itself and its two small moons, 
Phobos and Deimos. The missions launched a few days apart in July 1988.
 
Both Phobos spacecraft featured a new design that consisted of an instrumen-
tation section surrounded by electronics, sphere-shaped tanks that contained 
fuel for controlling the spacecraft’s altitude and orbit, and winglike solar 
panels for power.
The Mars “curse”
Space exploration is a difficult business, and 
not all missions are successful. Mars mis-
sions in particular have had a bad track record: 
Between 1960 and 2008, 42 missions were 
launched to Mars, but only 18 have been com-
pletely successful, with 4 more partial suc-
cesses (missions that either landed or reached 
orbit successfully but stopped transmitting data 
after sending back only a few pictures or mea-
surements). This success rate, of a little more 
than 50 percent, has led to humorous specula-
tion about a “Galactic Ghoul” that survives on a 
diet of Mars space probes.
A far more likely explanation is that Mars is a 
fascinating yet technically challenging target. 
On one hand, the dramatic scientific interest 
in exploration of the Red Planet has led to the 
launch of many missions. On the other hand, the 
difficulty of landing in the thin Martian atmo-
sphere, plus the technical complexity of many 
of these spacecraft, has led to many failures. 
As scientists discover more about Mars, and 
about building interplanetary spacecraft, Mars 
missions are becoming more reliable, and the 
success rate is slowly creeping up.

225
Chapter 15: Revenge of the Red Planet
Phobos 1 seemed to go as planned until it dropped communication less than 
a month after launch. The Soviets eventually discovered that a software 
glitch had turned off the spacecraft’s attitude thrusters, which were respon-
sible for controlling the orientation of the spacecraft so that it could use its 
solar panels to keep the batteries charged. Because Phobos 1 never made it 
into orbit around Mars, no useful mission data was collected.
Phobos 2 successfully orbited Mars and managed to return about 40 images 
before losing contact with Earth in March 1989, just before it was supposed 
to deploy a small lander onto the surface of Phobos. This time a computer 
failure was to blame. Future Soviet probes to Mars and other planets were 
all put on hold thanks to the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union. The Russian 
Federal Space Agency took over the Soviet Union’s space work and began 
putting all of its dwindling resources into keeping Russia’s cosmonaut pro-
gram and Mir space station running (you can read about Mir in Chapter 13).
Mars Observer goes missing in action 
(1992)
NASA’s Mars Observer was supposed to study the surface material of Mars in 
depth, in addition to determining the nature of Mars’s gravitational and mag-
netic fields and obtaining details on Martian weather and atmosphere. It was 
also meant to be the first of a series of missions, much like the Mariner and 
Pioneer mission series of two decades earlier (see Chapter 11). The Observer 
missions were intended to study the inner solar system, but Mars Observer 
was the only one of these missions to launch. Needless to say, it wasn’t a 
crowning achievement for NASA (perhaps in part due to the fast-track, low-
cost nature of the project).
Launch presented the first bad omen. A routine inspection of the spacecraft 
(which was already tucked inside its launch vehicle) prior to launch showed 
that its surface had been contaminated with debris, including metal filings 
and paint chips, due to ventilation with an impure source of nitrogen gas. 
The spacecraft had to be taken off the rocket booster for cleaning and ster-
ilization. Fortunately, the delay was relatively minor, and Mars Observer was 
launched into space a day later on September 25, 1992.
At first all seemed normal, and Mars Observer successfully traveled through 
interplanetary space toward Mars. However, the spacecraft lost contact 
with Earth a few days before it was scheduled to arrive in Martian orbit. All 
future attempts to contact it failed, and a panel was ultimately convened 
to determine the cause of the failure. Scientists later decided that the most 
likely problem was a rupture of a contained propellant line after the system 
was pressurized just before the planned rocket burn to enter orbit. The mis-
sion was a failure in terms of gathering data, but NASA engineers were able 
to upgrade future missions to account for what they think derailed Mars 
Observer.

226
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
Success at Last! Mars Pathfinder 
and Mars Global Surveyor
The failure of Mars Observer, which was a big flagship mission, left NASA’s 
planetary exploration program in an uproar. Scientists and engineers had lost 
large chunks of time and effort, and the agency itself had lost funding from 
the federal government. NASA was therefore ready for a new philosophy, 
summarized by the mantra “faster, better, cheaper,” and the new Discovery 
Program (which started with the NEAR spacecraft, as you find out in Chapter 
16) was the emblem of this approach.
Instead of risking it all by sending a single, huge mission into space, 
Discovery missions were designed to support innovations and try out new 
techniques. Mars Pathfinder, the second Discovery mission, was a serious 
shake-up of the Mars Exploration Program at NASA; Mars Global Surveyor 
(though not actually a Discovery mission) became the first orbiting post-
Viking success story with its detailed views of the Martian surface.
Mars Pathfinder: Innovative design meets 
the little rover that could (1996–1998)
As part of NASA’s Discovery Program, the Mars Pathfinder mission was seen 
mainly as a testbed for trying out technologies, innovations, and equipment 
intended for later missions. It was also responsible for conducting experi-
ments designed to reveal more about the structure, topography, and compo-
sition of the Martian surface.
The mission design of Mars Pathfinder was ambitious and risky, includ-
ing many technologies never before attempted by NASA. Most notably, it 
included not only a lander but also a small rover, the iconic Sojourner. The 
Pathfinder spacecraft itself also featured an innovative landing technique. 
Instead of using the standard retrorockets that had aided the landing of the 
Viking spacecraft two decades before, Pathfinder slowed its descent with 
parachutes. It then inflated giant airbags so it could bounce along the Martian 
surface before coming to a rest. If any Martians had been watching, they 
would’ve thought a giant beach ball had come to visit!
On July 4, 1997, seven months after its launch, the solar-powered Pathfinder 
bounced to a safe landing in the Red Planet’s Ares Vallis area. After the 
Sojourner rover rolled out of the lander, it got right to work by driving over to 
interesting rocks to examine them. Valuable data was sent back over a three-
month period, about two months longer than the mission was expected to last.

227
Chapter 15: Revenge of the Red Planet
 
The six-wheeled Sojourner rover, a veritable lightweight at only 23 pounds 
(10.4 kilograms), became the first successful rover to explore Mars. Sojourner 
contained three separate cameras, a laser tool for avoiding hazardous rocks 
and craters, and many other instruments designed to take measurements of 
Martian soil and surface properties.
The Pathfinder lander wasn’t sitting idly by while Sojourner worked. It was 
busy taking stereo images of the landing site, monitoring Sojourner’s prog-
ress, and studying the weather. Figure 15-1 shows a view of the Pathfinder 
lander and the Sojourner rover on Mars, with a map of where the rover trav-
eled during its mission.
Mars Pathfinder, and in particular the Sojourner rover, marked one of the 
first NASA missions to fully take advantage of the emerging Internet. Millions 
of people from around the world followed the mission via the Web site, log-
ging in daily to see the latest pictures. The novelty of watching a rover drive 
around the surface of another planet captured the imagination of the general 
public, and Sojourner had a huge impact on society’s renewed interest in 
Mars exploration.

Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
Mars Global Surveyor: Pictures and 
topography from orbit (1996–2006)
The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission, a separate mission from the 
Discovery Program, actually marked the beginning of the United States’ 
return to Mars because it launched a month before the Mars Pathfinder mis-
sion. However, it arrived in orbit around the Red Planet later than Pathfinder. 
To date, the Pathfinder mission still gets all the attention (largely because of 
Sojourner), making MGS the first runner-up to Pathfinder’s Miss Universe.
The MGS mission had several major scientific goals:
 
✓ Study and map the surface characteristics of Mars
 
✓ Discover the true shape of the planet, plus details on its topography
 
✓ Find out about Mars’s magnetic field
 
✓ Record weather patterns and atmospheric details
Equipment and instrumentation was packed into the spacecraft in order to 
accomplish these goals. The Mars Orbiter Camera took images (see one for 
yourself in Figure 15-2), the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter took topographic 
measurements, and a host of other instruments measured magnetic fields 
and thermal emissions.
Launch proceeded on November 7, 1996, and the orbiter reached Mars orbit 
on September 11, 1997 (around the time that the Mars Pathfinder mission 
was reaching its conclusion). In order to get closer to the surface, the space-
craft used a technique called aerobraking to lower its altitude; this is a fuel-
saving maneuver that uses atmospheric drag rather than the spacecraft’s 
engines to slow down and change the shape of the spacecraft’s orbit.

The MGS mission made significant scientific discoveries, including observa-
tions of surface features that changed over the course of the mission and 
could, perhaps, be due to liquid water near the surface of Mars. Other signifi-
cant contributions of the MGS mission include its study of key facets of the 
Martian climate and the info it gathered that could one day lead to human 
Mars exploration.
Despite being scheduled for completion in January 2001, MGS continued 
returning data to Earth for almost ten years until communications were lost 
in late 2006. During the extended portion of the mission, the spacecraft was 
able to take images of potential landing sites for future Mars missions and 
continue recording weather and atmospheric data.

Additional Flops in Mars Exploration 
in the Late 1990s
Mars exploration was like one giant roller coaster ride. After reaching a high 
point with the success of NASA’s 1996 missions (described earlier in this 
chapter), the success rate of Mars exploration plummeted, starting with 
a failed Russian launch in 1996. Then in 1998 and 1999, that success rate 
dipped even lower with the failure of two NASA missions. The following sec-
tions delve into what went wrong in these three cases, as well as what each 
mission would’ve accomplished had it succeeded.
Russia’s Mars 96 fails to leave 
Earth’s orbit (1996)
Following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian space pro-
gram was in chaos. Although an infusion of funds from NASA was able to help 
sustain Russian human spaceflight to the space station Mir, and later the 
International Space Station, Russia’s robotic space program wasn’t so fortu-
nate. Many of these missions were canceled or delayed for years.
In 1996, a Russian Mars mission, called Mars 96, was resurrected. Its goals 
were to explore the surface of Mars and create maps of the Red Planet’s 
structure, topography, and composition. Mars 96 also was charged with 
studying Mars’s magnetic field and examining gamma rays and other phe-
nomena on its way to the planet.
The Mars 96 spacecraft was similar in design to the earlier Soviet Phobos 
spacecraft, and it was supposed to have made some improvements based 
on the Phobos failures that we describe earlier in this chapter. Stuffed to the 
gills with equipment and instruments, Mars 96 was actually one of the most 
massive space probes in the history of space exploration, weighing around 
13,624 pounds (6,180 kilograms).
 
The spacecraft carried two landers, which in turn carried a series of instru-
ments to study the surface of Mars; Mars 96 also carried two penetrators 
designed to hit the Martian surface at a high speed to drive the pointed probe 
into the surface. Both penetrators were equipped with cameras, sensors, and 
other measuring equipment for analyzing the soil and material underneath the 
Martian surface. The idea was that after the spacecraft arrived at Mars, it’d 
deploy the landers. Then the penetrators would land and burrow into the 
surface separately.

231
Chapter 15: Revenge of the Red Planet
The Russians had high hopes that Mars 96 would be a triumphant success 
for a space program that had a history of Mars failures. Unfortunately, the 
Russian space program continued to have bad luck at Mars.
Although liftoff initially succeeded, the spacecraft’s launch vehicle failed in 
its final stage, leaving Mars 96 unable to leave Earth orbit. The spacecraft fell 
back to Earth about five hours later. Initially, Russian scientists thought that 
the spacecraft, with its radioactive plutonium fuel, had burned up safely in 
the atmosphere, with any remnants falling into the Pacific Ocean. However, 
reanalysis of the trajectory, as well as reports from witnesses on the ground, 
suggest that Mars 96 may have crashed in the Andes Mountains somewhere 
in Chile or Bolivia. It has yet to be found.
The failure of Mars 96 was a severe blow to the Russian robotic space 
exploration program. No other missions have been launched since Mars 96, 
although Russia is currently working on a new Mars mission, Phobos-Grunt, 
that could launch as soon as late 2009 and would return a sample from the 
Martian moon Phobos.
Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar 
Lander embarrass NASA (1998–1999)
The 1996 Mars Pathfinder and Mars Global Surveyor missions set the stage 
for what was to be an ambitious program of Mars exploration by NASA. 
However, that program was derailed almost before it began thanks to two 
mission failures. The Mars Climate Orbiter was part of a two-spacecraft pro-
gram with the Mars Polar Lander. These two Mars missions were intended 
to provide detailed studies of the weather, atmosphere, water, and general 
climate on Mars, but neither fulfilled its goals.
 
The loss of Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander resulted in severe 
setbacks for the just-rebounding NASA Mars exploration program. Both Mars 
Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander were lost due to minor, yet fatal, errors 
that would’ve been found with sufficient time and staff to perform quality 
checks and troubleshooting. Future Mars missions, such as Mars Odyssey and 
Phoenix Mars Lander (see Chapter 20), successfully learned from the mistakes 
of these two failed missions, but the tradeoff was that these later missions 
were far more costly.
Mars Climate Orbiter makes an expensive navigational error (1998)
The Mars Climate Orbiter was designed with equipment for monitoring 
weather, noting wind strength and other atmospheric conditions, recording 
the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, and generally giving scientists 
an understanding of how climate works on Mars. Stabilized around three 
axes, the orbiter contained cameras and other recording equipment, anten-
nae for data relay, solar panels for power, and a host of other instruments.

232
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
The spacecraft made it to Mars on schedule but lost contact while entering 
Martian orbit. A study of the failure revealed that the spacecraft mistakenly 
entered orbit far closer to Mars than was safe. Consequently, forces on Mars 
Climate Orbiter from friction and heating in the Martian atmosphere resulted 
in the spacecraft’s destruction.
The reason for the Mars Climate Orbiter’s failure was ultimately determined to 
be one that plagues anyone who has ever taken math or physics: units. The 
spacecraft’s software used pounds as the unit of force for the thrusters, but 
the spacecraft units were newtons, which means the flight instructions were off 
by a scientifically substantial amount (specifically, a factor of 4.45). Although 
an error in units may cost you a good grade in a science class, in this case, it 
caused a $300 million mistake that didn’t fulfill any of its mission goals.
Mars Polar Lander loses touch (1999)
The Mars Polar Lander was a 1999 mission scheduled to study the climate, 
weather, and atmosphere of Mars. It had similar goals to the Mars Climate 
Observer mission (see the preceding section), but the spacecraft itself con-
sisted of a lander that would’ve landed near the South Pole of Mars. This 
lander had a hexagonal base; robotic arms for taking samples; and an array of 
imaging devices, sensors, and antennae.
Mars Polar Lander was sent to Mars alongside two small probes designed to 
burrow into the Martian surface. These probes were quite small, around 5 
pounds (2.3 kilograms) each and surrounded by an aeroshell (a protective 
exterior shield) that would’ve allowed them to impact the surface, separate 
from the shells, and penetrate the soil.
The spacecraft and probes reached Mars orbit successfully following their 
launch on January 3, 1999, but they lost contact with Earth before landing. 
The failure of Mars Polar Lander was ultimately blamed on a software design 
error that caused the descent rockets to cut off too far above the surface of 
Mars, resulting in a crash-landing. The probes were also never heard from 
again, and the cause of their failure is still unknown (though likely unrelated 
to the loss of Mars Polar Lander).

Exploring the Inner Solar System
In This Chapter
▶ Seeing Venus via Magellan and Venus Express
▶ Studying the Moon and the Sun
▶ Investigating asteroids and comets
M
ars isn’t the only planet worth visiting, and in this chapter, you dis-
cover that exploration of the rest of the inner solar system continued 
from the late 1980s through the 1990s and into the early 21st century thanks 
to a series of missions operated by NASA and the European Space Agency 
(ESA). Some missions performed radar mapping of Venus, visited the Sun, 
and took detailed maps of the Moon’s geology and surface composition. 
Other missions touched down on an asteroid and retrieved samples of comet 
materials. Only one thing was certain: The inner solar system held a wealth of 
possibilities for new discoveries and achievements.
Magellan Peeks through the 
Veil of Venus (1989–1994)
Little was known about the surface of Venus throughout most of the 20th 
century because previous exploration of the planet in the 1970s had been 
foiled by thick clouds that prevented astronomers from seeing through to 
the surface. These clouds parted, but only briefly, for the Venera 15 and 16 
spacecraft, which performed radar mapping from orbit (see Chapter 11 for 
details). These preliminary maps were intriguing, but a full understanding of 
the nature of the surface of Venus required a global, high-resolution map.
The United States’ Magellan mission, launched in 1989 by the Space Shuttle 
Atlantis, used a sophisticated radar system that was specially designed to 
be able to see through the clouds of Venus. This system allowed the space-
craft to map the surface with unparalleled resolution (approximately ten 
times that of the Venera missions), revealing interesting details about the 
planet. The next couple sections clue you in to how this new mapping system 
worked and what details it uncovered.

234
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
Mapping with radar
Magellan’s radar mapping used a 12-foot (3.7-meter) diameter antenna 
to bounce radar signals off the surface of Venus (see Figure 16-1). Called 
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), this method sends radar signals out at an 
angle and captures the return signals. Instead of simply receiving a radar 
signal from one point on the planet’s surface, the SAR technique builds up an 
image of the surface using the motion of the spacecraft itself. Magellan was in 
orbit over the poles of Venus, which allowed it to map more than 98 percent 
of the planet’s surface.
 
Radar images are different from images taken with a visible-light camera. 
Rather than the darks and brights in a photo that correspond to surface 
regions whose colors may be dark and bright, radar images show smooth 
areas as dark and rough areas as bright. Smoothness or roughness relates to 
the physical characteristics of the planet’s surface as compared to the 5-inch 
(13-centimeter) wavelength of the radar system. Areas of the surface covered 
with rocks smaller than 5 inches across are considered “smooth” and appear 
dark, whereas areas with rocks larger than 5 inches across are considered 
“rough” and appear bright.

 Chapter 16: Exploring the Inner Solar System
Magellan’s radar images have been combined with altimetry data to pro-
duce three-dimensional stereo views of Vensus’s surface, made by combin-
ing slightly different views of the surface taken on different orbits. The SAR 
images provided the side view, whereas the altimetry data provided the view 
you’d get if you looked straight down at the planet. Together, they created a 
three-dimensional picture of the Venusian surface.
Uncovering details of Venus’s surface
 
The Magellan images revealed a Venusian surface that’s surprisingly Earth-like 
in many ways but lacking common geologic features found on the Earth. For 
example, most of Venus’s surface features are volcanic in nature, including 
huge lava plains, large shield volcanoes, and smaller lava domes. Lava chan-
nels that can be up to 3,700 miles (6,000 kilometers) long suggest that the lava 
was very fluid and likely erupted at a high rate. However, because Venus is a 
very hot planet, with a surface temperature as high as 850 degrees Fahrenheit 
(454 degrees Celsius), water isn’t stable at its surface, meaning the familiar 
geologic features carved by water on Earth (and Mars) are missing on Venus. 
In addition, Magellan found no evidence of plate tectonics on Venus, meaning 
that volcanic activity on Venus operates very differently from Earth. (If you’re 
curious to check out an image taken by Magellan, flip to the color section.)
One surprise found on Venus was that the surface appeared to be uniformly 
younger than expected, as shown by the small number of impact craters, 
with an average surface age of about 500 million years. In geologic time, this 
is quite young. Scientists are still debating whether a single cataclysmic 
resurfacing event, such as a global volcanic eruption, could’ve occurred 500 
million years ago, or whether the apparent surface age comes from ongoing 
geologic activity that slowly covers in parts of the planet’s surface.
Fast facts about Magellan
Following are the basic facts about the Magellan 
mission:
 ✓ Launch date and site: May 14, 1989; Kennedy 
Space Center, Florida
 ✓ Spacecraft name and mass at launch: 
Magellan; 7,612 lb (3,460 kg)
 ✓ Launch vehicle: Space Shuttle Endeavour 
and Inertial Upper Stage booster rocket
 ✓ Number of Venus orbits: 4,225
 ✓ Length of time in orbit: 4 years, 2 months

236
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
After Magellan accomplished its mapping goals, the spacecraft’s systems 
began to fail, and it was given one final task: to test a new technique called 
aerobraking (using a planet’s atmosphere to change the orbit of a spacecraft). 
Spacecraft controllers flew the spacecraft deep into Venus’s atmosphere 
until it burned up. The technique destroyed Magellan but helped engineers 
figure out how to use aerobraking to change the orbits of other spacecraft. 
Consequently, this technique has since been used successfully by Mars 
Global Surveyor (Chapter 15) and Mars Odyssey (Chapter 20).
Dedicated Spacecraft Visit 
the Moon and the Sun
The prominence of the Moon and the Sun in the sky may make them seem 
familiar, but both celestial bodies warranted dedicated missions in the 1990s 
for the purpose of revealing their secrets:
 
✓ After the heyday of American lunar exploration during the Project 
Apollo years (see Chapters 9 and 10), little further study of the Moon 
was done until the Clementine mission of the 1990s. This mission pro-
duced global digital maps of the Moon and was followed by the Lunar 
Prospector mission, which studied the Moon’s composition from orbit.
 
✓ Although the Sun is bright enough to be studied from Earth-based obser-
vatories, some aspects of it are still best studied by a dedicated space-
craft. Enter the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).
Investigating the Moon
To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing in 1989, 
President George H. W. Bush announced a new space exploration initiative 
that would’ve sent humans back to the Moon and on to Mars. The program 
never really got off the ground though because of the huge $500 billion 
price tag, but it did spur some renewed interest in the Moon as a target for 
observation.
Clementine (1994)
The Clementine mission, a joint effort of NASA and the Ballistic Missile 
Defense Organization, took American space exploration back to the Moon 
when it launched on January 25, 1994. Although the primary purpose of 
Clementine was to test how spacecraft and sensors behave when in space 
for long periods of time, NASA was also able to sneak in some science from a 
variety of different instruments.

237
 Chapter 16: Exploring the Inner Solar System
The eight-sided Clementine spacecraft, which measured 5.9 feet by 3.6 feet 
(about 1.8 meters by 1.1 meters), had solar panels to provide it with power 
and a dish antenna so it could relay data back to Earth. It carried seven 
experiments onboard, including a charged particle telescope and a laser 
altimeter.
Clementine actively observed the Moon using ultraviolet and infrared imag-
ing, laser altimetry, and other measurements. With the combined results of 
this various data, scientists pieced together a multispectral picture of the 
Moon’s surface, including a more in-depth study of lunar surface material and 
a modern digital global map of the Moon’s surface. These maps help scien-
tists better understand the geologic history of the Moon and have been used 
as a basis for future lunar exploration.
Lunar Prospector (1998–1999)
Part of the NASA Discovery series of missions (which we introduce in 
Chapter 15), the Lunar Prospector mission was charged with mapping the 
composition of the lunar surface. The small, cylindrical spacecraft launched 
on January 7, 1998, and entered lunar orbit four days later. During its voyage 
into lunar orbit, the spacecraft deployed three 8.2 foot (2.5 meter) arms that 
contained instruments and equipment for measuring the Moon’s gravity, 
atmosphere, temperature, and other quantities necessary for creating a sur-
face compositional map of the Moon.
Lunar Prospector sent home data concerning the Moon’s atmosphere and 
crust, as well as the potential for ice on the satellite’s surface. A major goal 
of the mission, which fit into the Prospector name, was to explore the Moon 
from the perspective of resources that might be available to help support 
either future human exploration or commercial enterprises. If water were 
found on the Moon, for instance, it would be a very important resource for 
future human bases.

238
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
 
Some space probes burn up in the Earth’s atmosphere when they return; 
others are left to continue orbiting until their rechargeable power supplies 
are completely drained. In the case of Lunar Prospector, NASA officials 
decided to crash the probe into the Moon’s surface, with the hope that the 
resulting impact plume would contain evidence that water existed within per-
manently shaded craters near the lunar poles. Lunar Prospector did crash in 
the appointed spot, a crater located at the Moon’s South Pole, but no water 
was detected.
Sending SOHO to spy on the Sun 
(1995–present)
The Sun’s cycles of internal activity can affect life on Earth. For example, 
solar flares can knock out communications satellites or risk the lives of astro-
nauts in orbit, making a detailed study of the Sun a high-priority mission for 
both the U.S. and Europe. Consequently, both nations set their sights on 
the Sun in 1995 with the launch of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory 
(SOHO), a collaborative project between NASA and the European Space 
Agency (ESA). SOHO’s primary mission was to study and discover more 
about the Sun from close range. Specifically, its mission goals were to under-
stand the core structure of the Sun, study the solar corona, and demystify 
the details behind solar winds.
The observatory consists of two separate modules, a Service Module and a 
Payload Module:
 
✓ The Service Module powers the spacecraft, controls its temperature, 
and sends data back to Earth.
 
✓ The Payload Module houses all the spacecraft’s instruments. 
Instrumentation on SOHO came from both European and American 
developers. Twelve main instruments are designed to work together to 
relay info back to Earth, and scientists worldwide use the data gleaned

from these instruments. The major instruments include ultraviolet 
imagers and solar wind and energetic particle detectors.
 
SOHO orbits between the Sun and the Earth, around a stable point known at 
the First Lagrangian Point, or L1. At L1, the gravity from the Sun and the Earth 
balances out, resulting in a particularly stable orbital configuration. SOHO 
orbits the L1 point so it can always communicate with Earth.
Originally intended to operate for about two years, SOHO is still operating as 
of this writing and has returned valuable data regarding solar winds, solar 
structures, coronal waves, and new phenomena such as solar tornadoes (see 
Figure 16-2). SOHO has also spotted hundreds of comets and played a large 
role in helping meteorologists give more-accurate weather predictions.

Venus Express Studies the Atmosphere 
(2005–Present)
In 2005, the European Space Agency (ESA) brought exploration of Venus back 
into the spotlight with Venus Express, the agency’s first foray into studying 
Venus. The origins of this mission go back to 2001, when there was an inter-
est in recycling the Mars Express mission design (see Chapter 20) for a trip to 
Venus. Because the conditions of Venus are quite different from those of Mars, 
though, many changes had to be made. For instance: Venus is about half the 
distance from the Sun as Mars is, so any spacecraft exploring Venus has to be 
able to withstand more heat. Of course, that closer proximity to the Sun also 
means the probe’s solar panels can gather and generate more power.
With these and other changes in mind, the Venus Express was prepared and 
launched in November 2005, reaching Venus about five months later. As 
of late 2008, Venus Express has made a number of interesting discoveries, 
including observations of frequent lightning, a vortex in the atmosphere over 
the South Pole of the planet, and evidence that liquid water could’ve existed 
on Venus long ago.
Venus Express has completed its 500-day mission and is on an extended mis-
sion until at least late 2009. It’s expected to take measurements and images of 
the Venusian atmosphere, particularly clouds, as well as perform global map-
ping of the planet’s surface through temperature studies. It’ll be the first such 
mission to globally map the atmospheric composition of Venus and make a 
comprehensive study of Venusian temperatures.

 Chapter 16: Exploring the Inner Solar System
Small Missions of Large Importance
Supplementing the planets and satellites of the inner solar system, smaller 
bodies (think comets and asteroids) provide leftover remnants of the early 
days of our solar system. Despite difficulties in targeting them, a number of 
NASA missions in the late 20th and early 21st centuries investigated these 
small objects. The next few sections detail the most-exciting of these 
missions.
NEAR orbits an asteroid (1996–2001)
NEAR (Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous) made history as the first spacecraft 
to orbit an asteroid. Launched in February 1996, NEAR was destined to ren-
dezvous with the near-Earth asteroid 433 Eros to help provide more informa-
tion about the composition, magnetic field, mass, and other attributes of the 
asteroid.
Although small by planetary standards, the asteroid 433 Eros is certainly 
nothing to sneeze at. The largest dimensions of the potato-shaped asteroid 
are 8 miles and 20 miles (13 kilometers and 33 kilometers); for comparison 
you could fit more than 200 football fields inside it, making it one of the larg-
est near-Earth asteroids. NEAR sent back high-resolution images (you can 
see one in Figure 16-3) and other measurements, and it was a successful first 
launch of NASA’s Discovery Program of low-cost spacecraft (flip to Chapter 
15 for more on the Discovery Program).

Even though NEAR was never built as a lander, in February 2001, at the end of 
its mission, the probe was commanded to go into a lower and lower orbit until 
it eventually touched 433 Eros’s surface. The asteroid’s extremely low gravity 
allowed the probe to survive the landing, creating a first in the grand scheme 
of space probe research: Something that wasn’t a lander landed!

Stardust brings home precious particles 
(1999–present)
The Stardust mission was the first sample return of particles from a comet. 
The spacecraft launched in February 1999 and used a gravity-assisted trajec-
tory to reach Comet Wild 2 in January 2004. As the spacecraft performed a 
close flyby of the comet, it collected samples from the comet’s coma (essen-
tially the ice and dust particles that make up the comet’s “tail”). The comet 
particles were captured in a very low-density collector called an aerogel, 
which preserved their delicate structure. The capsule containing the sample 
returned to Earth in 2006, landing with a parachute in the Utah desert. The 
main Stardust spacecraft continued past Earth and is en route to fly past 
Comet 9P/Tempel 1 in 2011.
 
The Stardust mission is historically significant because it marks the first time 
scientists had an opportunity to study an actual sample that came from primi-
tive comet material. Because comets are thought to be primordial remnants 
from when the solar system was young, researchers hope to use this informa-
tion to study the origin and evolution of the early solar system. Preliminary 
analysis of the sample found a number of interesting compounds, including 
nitrogen and organic compounds.

Deep Impact crashes into a comet 
(2005–present)
Deep Impact wasn’t just the name of a NASA mission launched in January 
1995 — it was what scientists wanted their spacecraft to leave on Comet 9P/
Tempel 1 so they could study the comet’s insides. The plan was to send part 
of the spacecraft on a collision course with the comet and use the impact to 
eject material from inside the comet into outer space, where it could be 
studied.
The spacecraft used during the Deep Impact mission was designed in two 
sections:
 
✓ A “Smart Impactor” was for crashing into the comet. It was armed with 
a camera so it could take pictures of the comet’s nucleus right up to the 
point when the impactor itself was destroyed.
 
✓ A flyby spacecraft was for photographing the crash and continuing on 
with — you guessed it — a flyby. The flyby spacecraft was solar-powered 
and shielded from flying comet debris (as well as flying spacecraft debris!) 
and boasted different types of cameras and other measuring devices.

 ✓ Launch vehicle: Delta II
 ✓ Number of Earth orbits: 2, as of this writing
 ✓ Mission duration: 7 years to date

244
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
 
Impact occurred on July 4, 2005. The impactor had detached successfully from 
the flyby spacecraft five days earlier and positioned itself so that the comet 
would fly into it. The impact made a large crater and ejected a large plume 
of material, as NASA scientists had hoped it would. However, images and com-
positional measurements taken by the flyby spacecraft showed more dust, 
and less ice, than scientists had anticipated. Due to the composition and 
chemistry, scientists were able to better pinpoint where the comet may have 
originated — the far reaches of the Kuiper Belt (see Chapter 2 for more on this 
part of the solar system).
Deep Impact is currently heading to a flyby of Comet Hartley-2 in 2010. The 
Stardust spacecraft (described in the preceding section) will fly past Comet 
9P/Tempel 1 in 2011 to study any changes that have occurred since Deep 
Impact’s visit.

T
ravel times to the outer solar system are long and conditions are harsh, 
meaning that next-generation orbiter missions, following the flybys of 
the Pioneer and Voyager missions (which we tell you about in Chapter 11), 
needed to be large. Two such flagship missions, Galileo and Cassini, visited 
Jupiter and Saturn, respectively, with impressive results, as you discover in 
this chapter:
 
✓ NASA’s Galileo spacecraft arrived in orbit around Jupiter in 1995. 
Galileo’s entry probe descended through the clouds of Jupiter to take 
measurements, while its orbiter made multiple flybys of Jupiter and its 
moons over the next eight years.
 
✓ NASA’s Cassini spacecraft reached Saturn orbit in 2004, and the accom-
panying Huygens probe (built by the European Space Agency, or ESA) 
landed on the surface of Titan in early 2005. Cassini’s mission continues

(1989–2003)
 
Exploration of the outer solar system began in earnest with the United States’ 
Galileo mission in the late 1980s. Named after the Renaissance astronomer 
Galileo Galilei, who discovered Jupiter’s four large moons, the Galileo mission 
to Jupiter featured a robotic spacecraft designed to study the Jovian system 
(Jupiter and its moons) in detail. The Galileo spacecraft, which was designed 
as a follow-up to the Voyager flybys of the Jovian system in the late 1970s, was 
launched into orbit by Space Shuttle Atlantis on October 18, 1989 (see Chap-
ter 14 for details). It was the first spacecraft to orbit a planet in the outer solar 
system.

Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
Galileo consisted of an orbiter and an atmospheric probe, together standing 
about 23 feet (7 meters) tall (see Figure 17-1). One section contained instru-
ments and equipment; another section was devoted to a powerful high-gain 
antenna for transmitting data. Because Galileo would be too far from the Sun, 
solar panels weren’t an option for keeping the spacecraft powered, so two 
radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) with radioactive plutonium 
were used instead (we explain RTGs in more detail in Chapter 3). Instruments 
onboard Galileo included many devices geared toward studying surface geol-
ogy, composition, radiation, particles, magnetic fields, and other aspects of 
Jupiter and its moons.

Although hampered in data return by its crippled high-gain antenna, the 
Galileo spacecraft was otherwise a triumph of engineering in that it returned 
images and other measurements of Jupiter for around eight years. This dura-
tion surpassed all estimates of the amount of radiation damage the space-
craft could endure and still operate.
The following sections highlight Galileo’s story, from the mission’s exciting 
yet problematic launch to its ending sacrifice.

247
 Chapter 17: Voyages to the Outer Solar System
Kicking things off with priceless 
views and a broken antenna
For the Galileo spacecraft, the journey to Jupiter turned out to be almost as 
exciting as the destination. With a looping trajectory that took the spacecraft 
around Earth twice and Venus once, NASA mission planners were able to 
design a flight path that used the “gravitational slingshot” method (described 
in Chapter 3) to hurl Galileo toward Jupiter. Along the way, Galileo took spec-
tacular pictures of the Earth and its moon together; it also performed the 
first close-up flybys of two asteroids, Gaspra and Ida. Galileo even had prime 
seating when Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 collided with Jupiter in July 1994 and 
returned images back to Earth before Jupiter rotated enough to be seen by 
Earth-based telescopes. The spacecraft finally arrived at Jupiter in 1995.
Despite this exciting start, the mission almost self-destructed. The high-gain 
antenna, which sat like an umbrella at Galileo’s peak, had been folded and 
tucked behind a sunshade for most of the journey to Jupiter. When the time 
came to open the antenna, it only opened partway because of friction in the 
antenna ribs. No amount of maneuvering by scientists on Earth could open 
the antenna completely, so the mission had to rely on the less-powerful, 
slower-transmitting low-gain antenna instead. Although the Galileo mission 
still performed useful science, its total data return was severely limited by 
the loss of the high-gain antenna.
 
Scientists determined that the antenna rib likely got stuck during the years 
that Galileo sat in storage, awaiting its turn to be launched whenever the 
Space Shuttle returned to flight following the Challenger disaster in 1986 (see 
Chapter 5). Fortunately, engineers were able to come up with innovative 
image-compression algorithms that could be performed on the spacecraft’s 
rudimentary computer, which helped increase the total data download and 
allowed the weaker antenna to still meet most of the mission objectives.
Probing the atmosphere for a short while
The probe component of Galileo, designed to study Jupiter’s atmosphere, 
was jettisoned from the main Galileo spacecraft in July 1995, several months 
before the latter reached Jupiter. When the probe reached Jupiter’s atmo-
sphere in December, it slowed down as it flew through, collecting data along 
the way via its onboard instruments. These instruments included mass spec-
trometers, cloud-detection equipment, sensors for measuring temperature 
and pressure, and particle detectors for studying Jupiter’s radiation belts.

248
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
The Galileo probe sent data back to the orbiter (for later relay to Earth) for 
nearly an hour before it stopped communicating. As expected, the probe 
most likely melted and, eventually, disintegrated as it moved deeper into 
Jupiter’s atmosphere. Scientists are still puzzling over the probe’s findings, 
which included the fact that Jupiter’s atmosphere possesses far less water 
than originally predicted. The probe also found higher-than-expected con-
centrations of certain chemical elements called noble gases (think argon, 
krypton, and xenon, among others). The presence of these elements, which 
don’t react with most substances, suggests that Jupiter may have formed in a 
colder part of the solar system than originally thought.
Studying the satellites
 
The Galileo mission answered a number of questions about Jupiter’s satellites 
(moons). Its four large satellites — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto — are 
particularly interesting because of their varied appearances:
 
✓ The Voyager missions of the late 1970s discovered volcanoes on Io, but 
Galileo one-upped them by confirming that Io is the most volcanically 
active body in the solar system. (In fact, it’s about 100 times more vol-
canically active than Earth is today!) Io’s tidal heating results in material 
being ejected in volcanic plumes and lava flows, which cover the moon’s 
surface. (Tidal heating is the way that the interior of a planet or satellite 
is heated due to the squishing and pulling that takes place due to vary-
ing gravitational forces.)
 
✓ Another major discovery by Galileo was evidence for a liquid water 
ocean under the icy surface of Europa. Images from the Galileo mis-
sion showed a cracked surface with iceberglike features; gravitational 
measurements showed that the surface is made up of a layer with the 
density of water and/or ice and is about 62 miles (100 kilometers) thick. 
Results from Galileo’s magnetometer gave the most decisive evidence 
for an ocean on Europa, with the discovery of an induced magnetic field 
consistent with a large subsurface volume of salty water, similar to ter-
restrial seawater. Although not yet definitively confirmed, Galileo results 
very strongly suggest that Europa’s subsurface contains an ocean with 
more water than all of Earth’s oceans combined. And where there’s 
water, there’s the possibility for life. (Check out an image of Europa 
taken by Galileo in the color section.)
 
✓ Galileo also took images of Ganymede, the only moon in the solar 
system with its own magnetic field, and Callisto. Callisto is an old cra-
tered body, whereas Ganymede has undergone some cracking and fault-
ing in the past due to the slight degree of tidal heating that it receives. 
Interestingly, magnetic field measurements suggest that both Ganymede 
and Callisto could also have subsurface liquid oceans, though these 
bodies of water would be much farther beneath the surface than the 
ocean on Europa.

249
 Chapter 17: Voyages to the Outer Solar System
 
Io, Europa, and Ganymede are in an orbital resonance with Jupiter. An orbital 
resonance is the state that occurs when orbiting planets, satellites, or other 
celestial bodies exert a specific gravitational force upon the other bodies in 
the circuit. So for every time Ganymede goes around Jupiter once, Europa 
goes around the planet twice, and Io goes around it four times. This resonance 
keeps the orbits noncircular and helps drive tidal heating, because the sur-
faces of the satellites are squeezed and flexed. Tidal heating is most prevalent 
on Io because it’s closest to Jupiter, but tidal heating is significant on Europa 
as well. The degree of heating is reflected in the moons’ surface geologies.
Making a heroic sacrifice at mission’s end
After two years of study, Galileo completed its primary mission in 1997, 
but the length of its overall mission was extended multiple times to add 
additional flybys of the satellites and studies of Jupiter’s atmosphere and 
rings. Data from Galileo was used to study the composition of Jupiter’s atmo-
sphere, including clouds made from ammonia ice, and measure wind speeds 
around the Great Red Spot (a giant storm in Jupiter’s atmosphere) and other 
features. Images also revealed the fine structure of Jupiter’s faint ring system. 
Galileo spent a total of eight years in orbit around Jupiter and managed to 
complete almost all of its mission objectives despite its nonfunctional high-
gain antenna.
At the end of Galileo’s mission, NASA mission planners faced a painful choice 
about the fate of the aging spacecraft, which was running out of propellant 
for the thrusters that refined its orbit and controlled its position. In addition, 
the computer chips and other components that controlled the spacecraft 
were far over their design tolerances for radiation and would soon cease 
operating. Such spacecraft are normally left to have their orbits decay natu-
rally, but mission designers faced an additional complication when operating 
in the Jovian system: The discovery of a likely subsurface ocean on Europa 
(see the previous section) meant that the prospects for life there were high 
enough that planetary protection constraints came into play.
Galileo, as an orbiter, was never sterilized after being built on Earth. In addi-
tion to the possible microbes that could still be living inside the spacecraft, 
another danger came from the nuclear power source that fueled it. Rather 
than run the risk of an out-of-control spacecraft crashing into Europa’s 
surface in the future (and possibly contaminating a subsurface biosphere), 
NASA mission planners made the difficult choice to send the still-functioning 
Galileo deep into Jupiter’s atmosphere, where it could burn up without caus-
ing any potential damage to Europa. In September 2003, Galileo sent its final 
signals back to Earth before entering Jupiter’s atmosphere.

Cassini-Huygens Views the Saturn 
System (1997–Present)
Cassini-Huygens, a flagship-style NASA mission to the Saturn system, was 
nearly 20 years in the making. As far back as 1982, scientists were discuss-
ing ways to tag-team a mission to Saturn with one to Titan, one of Saturn’s 
moons. The final product of these brainstorms, Cassini-Huygens, was a joint 
venture between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Italian 
Space Agency (ASI). The mission consisted of two basic parts: The Cassini 
orbiter, named after a famous Italian-French astronomer, was built by NASA; 
the Huygens space probe, named after a famous Dutch astronomer, was 
built by ESA. ASI built the high-gain antenna for Cassini, as well as the radar 
system used to see through Titan’s clouds.
The Cassini-Huygens mission’s goals focused on Saturn and its large moon 
Titan. The Cassini orbiter was charged with studying Saturn’s rings, clouds, 
and other atmospheric conditions; investigating its satellites; and performing 
a wide-ranging investigation of Titan’s atmosphere and surface. The Huygens 
probe was responsible for returning surface and atmospheric data during 
its trip through Titan’s atmosphere and for about an hour and a half after 
landing. The mission launched on October 15, 1997, complete with a hefty 
science payload (or cargo, specifically the scientific experiments and equip-
ment required for the mission). In the following sections, we offer insight into 
the massive inventory of instrumentation aboard Cassini and delve into the 
details of what the mission has found.
 
The Cassini orbiter was recently approved for an extended mission, which will 
continue until at least mid-2010. Check out these Web sites for the latest pic-

Cassini’s load of complex instruments
The Cassini orbiter (see Figure 17-2) is the size of a school bus, measuring 
22 feet (6.8 meters) high by 13 feet (4 meters) wide. As one of the most-
complex spacecraft ever built, the orbiter contains a number of complex 
scientific instruments, including the following:
 
✓ The Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) instrument for bouncing sig-
nals off Titan’s surface to see through the clouds
 
✓ The Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) for taking pictures of Saturn and 
its moons under a range of visible light conditions
 
✓ The Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) for gauging the 
composition of surfaces, atmospheres, and even planetary rings
 
✓ A cosmic dust analyzer for studying the small particles orbiting Saturn
 
✓ A composite infrared spectrometer for measuring temperatures
 
✓ An ion and neutral mass spectrometer for studying charged and neutral 
particles
 
✓ A radio and plasma wave experiment for detecting radio waves from 
Saturn
 
✓ A UV imaging spectrograph for taking images and spectra at UV 
wavelengths
 
✓ A magnetometer for studying Saturn’s magnetic field
Because Cassini was intended to operate far from the Sun, NASA engineers 
designed it to run off of three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs; 
see Chapter 3 for the full scoop on RTGs). These RTGs were designed to be 
long-lasting, and they still provide sufficient power more than ten years after 
Cassini’s launch.
 
More than 70 pounds of plutonium were rocketed into space with Cassini, 
causing no small amount of protesting from environmentalists and others 
concerned about the dangers of sending this amount of radioactive material 
into space. The only real risk was from the spacecraft failing and crashing 
immediately after launch, like Mars 96 did (see Chapter 15), or during its close 
Earth flyby en route to Saturn. The RTGs were actually designed to be strong 
enough to withstand some sort of catastrophic landing back on Earth, making 
the chances of sufficient plutonium dispersal to be hazardous extremely low. 
In any event, Cassini’s launch and Earth flyby took place uneventfully.

Cassini takes images of Saturn and 
its satellites (2004–present)
 
Upon arriving at Saturn on July 1, 2004, Cassini flew through the plane of 
Saturn’s rings and had its only close approach to the dark outer moon Phoebe. 
Cassini has made almost 100 orbits of Saturn as of this writing, with each orbit 
targeted with a close flyby of one or more satellites. The spacecraft’s discover-
ies are many and varied. For example, Cassini took detailed images of Phoebe, 
including some that led scientists to believe that water ice exists in the moon’s 
subsurface layer. Cassini images also
 
✓ Showed a huge ridge encircling the middle of the moon Iapetus like a 
belt.
 
✓ Found hurricanes at Saturn’s North and South Poles; winds in these 
stable storms circulate like a whirlpool at speeds of about 325 miles 
(530 kilometers) per hour — twice as fast as the fastest winds in similar 
features on Earth.
 
✓ Discovered four new small moons, including one, Daphnis, that orbits 
inside Saturn’s rings.

253
 Chapter 17: Voyages to the Outer Solar System
 
✓ Spotted features in Saturn’s rings called spokes, as well as incomplete 
“ring arcs” that extend before and after some small moons in their orbits 
but don’t form a complete ring.
However, the true stars of the Saturn system turned out to be the moons 
Enceladus and Titan; we describe Cassini’s discoveries on these moons in 
more detail in the following sections.
Geysers on Enceladus (2005)
Tiny Enceladus, which is the sixth-largest of Saturn’s moons, was officially 
discovered in 1789, but little was known about it until NASA’s Voyager mis-
sions in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which took low-resolution pictures 
that showed a bright surface. In 2005, Cassini flew past Enceladus and spot-
ted startling signs of activity for such a small moon: Huge geysers of material 
were observed being ejected from Enceladus’s surface (see Figure 17-3). The 
geyser sites are located at the moon’s South Pole, and the plumes contain 
primarily water ice (in addition to other materials). The geysers are associ-
ated with areas of extremely high temperatures, consistent with pockets of 
warm, liquid water under the surface that could act as reservoirs.

The discovery of geysers on Enceladus means that this small satellite joins 
only Jupiter’s moon Io and Neptune’s moon Triton as extraterrestrial sites of 
ongoing geologic activity. Some material ejected from the geysers falls back 
onto the surface of Enceladus, and the rest of it goes into orbit. Enceladus is 
covered with fresh, bright frost from the deposited geyser material, explaining 
the very bright surface first seen by Voyager. Enceladus orbits Saturn embed-
ded in a tenuous ring called the E ring, and scientists now believe that the 
geyser material that escapes Enceladus is actually the source of this ring. The 
mechanics of what drives the geysers, or provides the heat source for them, 
are still the subject of vigorous scientific debate.

254
Part III: Second-Generation Missions 
Views of Titan’s surface (2005)
Instruments onboard Cassini were specifically designed to see through 
the moon Titan’s thick, hazy atmosphere in order to provide scientists 
with a clear view of the surface below. The innovative RADAR instrument 
has proved to be the real star of Titan surface studies. Similar to the radar 
mapper on the Magellan spacecraft that observed Venus (see Chapter 16), 
Cassini’s RADAR instrument sends radio signals out that bounce off Titan’s 
surface and are collected by the spacecraft. The motion of the spacecraft 
helps build up an image, and a long, narrow image “noodle” is collected on 
each close radar flyby.
 
Data and images gathered by Cassini in 2005 have shown Titan to possess a 
surprisingly familiar surface. Although Titan’s surface temperatures are cold 
enough that exotic substances such as ethane and methane are liquid, these 
materials flow over the surface and form lakes and valleys just like liquid 
water does on Earth. Much of Titan’s surface currently appears dry, but lakes 
of methane have been found near the moon’s North Pole. These are the first 
lakes found beyond Earth, with implications for hydrocarbons and organic 
chemistry creating possibilities for life on Titan.
The Huygens probe lands on Titan (2005)
To complement the orbital observations of Titan from the Cassini orbiter 
(described in the previous section), the Huygens space probe, which hitched 
a ride to Saturn aboard Cassini, was designed to take detailed measurements 
of Titan’s atmosphere and surface from the moon itself. Because the probe 
was too far from Earth to accept data from or send data to NASA directly, its 
findings were relayed through Cassini. In the following sections, we describe 
Huygens’s descent through Titan’s atmosphere and its landing on the moon’s 
surface.
Parachuting and photographing through the thick atmosphere
On December 25, 2004, the Huygens probe was set free from Cassini courtesy 
of a spring mechanism. It then traveled independently, entering Titan’s atmo-
sphere just over two weeks after its launch. As the probe slowly parachuted 
to Titan’s surface, it took images and analyzed Titan’s winds and the chemi-
cal composition of its atmosphere.
 
Images sent back from Huygens during its descent showed what appeared to 
be drainage channels: Dark swatches crossed larger, light swatches as they 
led into very large (sealike) dark swatches. These channels are much smaller 
than those that can be seen from the orbiting Cassini spacecraft, supporting 
the theory that liquid has traveled over much of Titan’s surface at various 
times. In all, Huygens sent about 700 images to Cassini for relay back to Earth. 
Unfortunately, a software glitch resulted in the loss of about half of those 
images.

255
 Chapter 17: Voyages to the Outer Solar System
Landing on a world of ice
Huygens was primarily designed to study Titan’s atmosphere, but NASA engi-
neers (those ol’ Boy Scouts) wanted to be prepared in case the probe sur-
vived its landing. Of course, they didn’t know whether Huygens was headed 
for dry land or a global ocean, so they made sure it could survive a landing 
on either a wet or dry surface — if it had landed in liquid, it would even have 
floated!
As it turned out, Huygens landed on a dry riverbed, surrounded by rounded 
ice pebbles (see Figure 17-4). No liquid was detected, though a slight increase 
in methane vapor was detected shortly after the probe’s landing.
Huygens’s battery was intended to last for three hours at most, and much of 
that time was occupied with the probe’s descent to the surface, so there was 
little time available for sending back data. The probe managed to transmit 
data from the surface for 90 minutes. The Cassini orbiter was well out of trans-
mission range at this point, so the data was received by large radio telescopes 
back on Earth, which were monitoring the probe’s faint signals. Scientists 
couldn’t receive images from Huygens, but they could confirm that the probe 
was still alive and transmitting. It’s not like they missed out on much though. 
Because Huygens’s cameras couldn’t move, the probe sent back the same 
view of Titan’s surface over and over again. Talk about déjà vu!

T
elescopes have revolutionized society’s understanding of the cosmos. 
However, you can see only so much from the ground, because the atmo-
sphere on Earth blocks the view of distant stars and galaxies at some wave-
lengths and blurs the view in others. For this reason, most observatories are 
located on the tops of tall mountains, where the air is thinner. But for an even 
better view, why not turn to space? Telescopes in space don’t have to peer 
through any atmosphere at all, which means they can view the cosmos with 
unprecedented clarity.
To take advantage of this fact, NASA has established the Great Observatories 
Program, which consists of a series of large space telescopes. The Hubble 
Space Telescope observes in visible wavelengths; the Compton Gamma Ray 
Observatory and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory study the high-energy uni-
verse; and the Spitzer Space Telescope and the planned James Webb Space 
Telescope observe longer-wavelength infrared emissions. We describe all of 
these telescopes in detail in this chapter.

The Hubble Space Telescope Clears 
the Way (1990–Present)
The Hubble Space Telescope, the world’s biggest telescope in space, has not 
only made amazing discoveries about the nature of the universe but it has 
also greatly helped popularize astronomy. Hubble has taken extremely clear 
photographs of the cosmos, and these images have graced the covers of cal-
endars, textbooks, and many other forms of media. In fact, they’ve become 
some of the most iconic, and reproduced, astronomical images ever.
 
Hubble images have revealed aspects of the universe that were largely 
unknown in previous years. For instance, Hubble data has suggested that 
black holes are likely to exist in the centers of all galaxies, and it has even 
helped scientists estimate their masses. More recently, observations from 
Hubble have provided direct images of extrasolar planets for the first time 
and revealed young stars with planet-forming disks of dust and debris around 
them.
In addition to the pictures, the scientific discoveries made by Hubble are 
magnificently varied. For example, Hubble has recorded optical phenomena 
related to gamma-ray bursts that give crucial information about how stars 
are formed. Additionally, in 2001, research teams were able to use Hubble 
data to make a measurement of the rate of expansion of the universe, which 
can be used to determine both the age and the ultimate fate of the universe.
In the following sections, we share how Hubble went from being an impres-
sive idea to an amazing reality, explain the technology used by Hubble, and 
describe the repairs Hubble has needed over the years.
How Hubble came to be
First suggested in the 1940s by Lyman Spitzer, the Hubble Space Telescope 
took many years to reach fruition as the world’s biggest telescope in space. A 
deal with the European Space Agency (ESA) in the late 1970s resulted in the 
ESA supplying solar panels and one instrument for the telescope in return 
for a percentage of observing time. Work began on the telescope in 1978 with 
an initial planned launch date in 1983, but the launch was postponed due to 
construction delays.
Hubble was finally completed in the mid-1980s and was scheduled for launch 
in late 1986. However, the Challenger disaster of early 1986 (see Chapter 5) 
grounded all Space Shuttle flights until 1988. As a result, the telescope didn’t 
launch until April 1990 when Space Shuttle Discovery carried it into orbit (flip 
to Chapter 14 for details on the launch).

261
 Chapter 18: What a View! Telescopes in Space
The telescope is in a low Earth orbit so it can be reached by the Space 
Shuttle for servicing missions. Hubble (shown in Figure 18-1) orbits the Earth 
every 97 minutes and moves at about 18,000 miles per hour.

The Hubble Space Telescope was named after Edwin Hubble, a pioneering 
American astronomer. After a brief career in law, Hubble studied astronomy 
and created a system for listing and classifying the galaxies that he observed. 
He was one of the first modern-era scientists to map the cosmos. He also came 
up with a method, known as Hubble’s Law, for discerning the nature of the 
ever-expanding universe.
The telescope’s technology
Hubble is composed of three main elements: the spacecraft itself, the instru-
ments that collect and store data, and the optics that make it all happen. The 
telescope-spacecraft is a solar-powered, insulated structure that serves as 
a home for the instruments, which in turn are driven by optical technology 
designed to collect light and precisely reflect it through mirrors.
The light-gathering capability of telescopes on Earth is usually measured 
by the size of their mirrors. Hubble’s 7.9-foot (2.4-meter) diameter mirror 
is small compared to some ground-based telescopes. However, the lack of 
atmosphere, the cool operating temperatures in space, and the telescope’s 
very large detector (the chip that detects light coming from the mirror) mean 
that Hubble can take stunning images of unprecedented clarity. (Head to the 
color section to see an image taken by Hubble.)

262
Part IV: Current Space Exploration 
The images produced by Hubble are created using one of several instrument 
systems that take images ranging from the near-infrared to the ultraviolet. 
The instruments have been upgraded and changed out over the years; the 
current complement in orbit includes cameras that observe in visible and 
ultraviolet light, take infrared images, capture wide field and planetary 
images, and measure temperature and composition.
Many of the current instruments have failed and are awaiting repair or 
replacement on the next Hubble servicing mission (see the later section 
“Keeping Hubble up to snuff: Other servicing missions” for the scoop).
A few fixes for Hubble
Hubble was the first space observatory designed to be serviced in space by 
astronauts. We describe the events of Hubble’s servicing missions in the 
following sections. (Check out an image of a servicing mission in the color 
section.)
Providing clarity to blurry images: The first repair
Shortly after Hubble’s launch, NASA officials realized that the telescope’s 
main mirror had a slight manufacturing defect and needed to be repaired. 
Although the mirror had been built to exacting specifications, its edges were 
just ever-so-slightly too flat. The flaw was only a matter of 0.00009 inches 
(0.00002 centimeters), but it was serious enough that instead of bringing 
images to a sharp focus, the light was smeared out over the image, resulting 
in pictures that looked blurry and unfocused.
After spending decades — and billions of dollars — on the telescope, the 
out-of-focus images opened NASA up to public ridicule. Hubble was widely 
regarded as a dud by the popular media, even though it was able to carry out 
a portion of its observing duties despite the blurry images.
Fortunately, NASA didn’t have to abandon the telescope completely. Because 
the problem was a stable, optical issue, NASA engineers were able to design 
an adaptive mirror called COSTAR. Similar to a pair of corrective eyeglasses, 
COSTAR fit into the telescope to correct the images Hubble was capturing.
 
Hubble was restored to its intended glory during the first servicing mission 
in 1993. Astronauts on mission STS-61 matched the orbit of the Space Shuttle 
Endeavour to Hubble and then reached out with the Shuttle’s robotic arm 
to grab the telescope and bring it into the Shuttle’s payload (cargo) bay. In 
addition to installing the COSTAR corrector, they installed a new camera

with built-in optical correction, replaced the solar panels, and replaced other 
components of the telescope’s electronics and pointing systems. The ten-
day mission, which involved five long spacewalks (the more-common term 
for extravehicular activities [EVAs] done in space) that were covered live on 
national television, was grueling but widely regarded as a complete success. 
Astronomers proudly showed off crystal-clear images of the cosmos, and 
today, 18 years after its launch, Hubble is thought of as one of the gems of 
NASA’s astronomical program, with its blurry early days largely forgotten.
Keeping Hubble up to snuff: Other servicing missions
Three other servicing missions have kept Hubble going over the years:
 
✓ Servicing Mission 2, which took place aboard Space Shuttle Discovery on 
flight STS-82 in 1997, upgraded the telescope to take pictures at longer 
wavelengths, better study distant galaxies, and search for black holes.
 
✓ Servicing Missions 3A and 3B involved further maintenance upgrades 
and repairs:
 
• Mission 3A, once again aboard Space Shuttle Discovery but this 
time on flight STS-103 in 1999, replaced four failed gyroscopes 
responsible for keeping the telescope at a steady orientation so it 
can perform observations. This mission also installed a new com-
puter, bringing Hubble’s onboard memory to a whopping 2 mega-
bytes of RAM.
 
• Mission 3B, aboard Space Shuttle Columbia on mission STS-109 in 
2002, installed a new camera (one that could produce even higher-
quality images), repaired the near-infrared imaging device, and 
replaced solar panels responsible for powering the telescope.
Fast facts about the Hubble Space Telescope
Following are the basic facts about the Hubble 
Space Telescope:
 ✓ Launch date and site: April 24, 1990; 
Kennedy Space Center, Florida
 ✓ Spacecraft name and mass launch: Hubble 
Space Telescope; 24,250 lb (11,110 kg)
 ✓ Launch vehicle: Space Shuttle Discovery
 ✓ Number of Earth orbits: More than 110,000, 
as of this writing
 ✓ Length of time in Earth orbit: 18 years to 
date

Part IV: Current Space Exploration 
To keep Hubble operational, a fourth servicing mission is crucial. Although 
it was initially canceled due to the few remaining Shuttle flights being des-
ignated solely for International Space Station construction (see Chapter 19 
for details on the ISS), the fourth servicing mission was reinstated. Originally 
scheduled to launch in October 2008 aboard Space Shuttle Atlantis, the mis-
sion was postponed when an essential computer component aboard the 
telescope failed. NASA is delaying Servicing Mission 4 until 2009 to allow 
astronauts to train to replace that component. Ultimately, this mission will 
breathe new life into Hubble, fixing or upgrading all the scientific instruments 
and giving the telescope an orbital boost that’s expected to keep it alive and 
well until at least 2014, and perhaps as long as 2020.

Expanding the rainbow: The electromagnetic 
spectrum
If you’ve ever seen a rainbow, you know that 
sunlight can be divided into different colors. 
What’s actually going on is that visible white 
light is made up of a combination of differ-
ent colors, each with a different wavelength. 
Think of light as a wave that, like the waves at 
the beach, has a certain distance between 
peaks. This distance is called a wavelength — 
in the rainbow of visible light, red light has a 
longer wavelength, and violet light has a shorter 
wavelength.
The idea of wavelengths of light can be 
expanded beyond what your eye can actually 
see. Visible light is just a small part of what’s 
called the electromagnetic spectrum, which 
refers to a huge range of energy that’s given off 
by stars like the Sun and radiates though space. 
The wavelength of electromagnetic radiation 
is related to its energy — shorter-wavelength 
radiation, such as ultraviolet waves, X-rays, and 
gamma rays, has increasingly higher energy 
than visible light. On the longer wavelength side 
of things, past the red side of the visible spec-
trum, are infrared radiation, microwaves, and 
radio waves, with increasingly longer wave-
lengths and lower energies.
Because celestial objects such as stars and 
galaxies give off radiation all along the electro-
magnetic spectrum, NASA’s four great obser-
vatories were designed to collect data in the 
gamma ray, X-ray, visible, and infrared parts 
of the spectrum. Radio waves are long enough 
to pass through the Earth’s atmosphere almost 
unaltered, so radio telescopes can easily be 
located on the ground without the need for a 
dedicated space telescope.

The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory’s 
High-Energy Mission (1991–2000)
Gamma rays are a very high-energy, short-wavelength form of electromag-
netic radiation given off by some of the most energetic, and rarest, celestial 
phenomena such as supernovas (star explosions), black holes that are in 
the process of pulling in mass, solar flares, and pulsars (rapidly spinning 
stars). They’re also difficult to study from the ground, which is why NASA’s 
second Great Observatory, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), 
was launched into orbit by Space Shuttle Atlantis in 1991. (Figure 18-2 shows 
CGRO at launch.)

The CGRO had several notable achievements. It
 
✓ Discovered a “young” (nearly 700-years-old) supernova that had gone 
undetected by previous telescopes
 
✓ Helped astronomers develop a full data base of gamma ray bursts, 
thereby enabling the discovery that these rare events come from out-
side the Milky Way Galaxy
 
✓ Supplied valuable information on the source of gamma ray bursts, 
including radio galaxies, newly discovered pulsars, and solar flares

266
Part IV: Current Space Exploration 
CGRO didn’t look like a telescope in the traditional sense of the word. Instead 
of having a small primary mirror and light-gathering arrangements, CGRO’s 
instruments had to be large to detect rare gamma-ray photons. In fact, at the 
time of its launch, CGRO was the heaviest satellite devoted to astrophysics 
ever flown. (The Chandra X-Ray Observatory, which we cover in the next sec-
tion, later beat CGRO to become the heaviest payload launched by the Space 
Shuttle.)
 
CGRO takes its name, but not its looks, from Dr. Arthur H. Compton, a Nobel 
Prize–winning scientist who made great strides in the field of high-energy 
physics.
 
At the end of its planned lifetime, one of the gyroscopes that helped con-
trol the spacecraft’s orientation in space failed. Unlike the Hubble Space 
Telescope, CGRO wasn’t designed to be serviced by astronauts, so the failed 
device couldn’t be replaced. Instead of waiting for a second gyroscope to 
fizzle out and leave the spacecraft unmaneuverable, NASA decided to bring 
CGRO out of orbit in a controlled crash. Most of the spacecraft burned up in 
the atmosphere on June 4, 2000, with the rest falling safely into the Pacific 
Ocean.
The Chandra Observatory X-rays 
the Universe (1999–Present)
The third of the four Great Observatories is the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, 
launched in 1999 by Space Shuttle Columbia. X-ray observations are particu-
larly well-suited to space telescopes because they’re absorbed by the Earth’s 
atmosphere almost completely. Chandra was designed to be able to detect 
X-ray emissions that were 100 times fainter than anything seen before by pre-
vious satellites.

X-rays have a lower energy than gamma rays, which means a satellite observ-
ing an object can actually image that object by using X-rays. That’s what 
makes this X-ray–focused satellite so special: Because X-rays are given off by 
energetic sources in the Milky Way Galaxy and in other galaxies, Chandra has 
been able to observe remnants from supernovas and the centers of galaxies. It 
has also observed neutron stars and black holes and helped astronomers 
understand dark matter. Chandra has also detected cool gas spiraling into the 
center of a nearby galaxy and caught X-rays being given off as material in a 
planet-forming disk fell back onto its central star, helping astronomers under-
stand the role of gas and dust in planet formation.
To detect high-energy X-rays, Chandra possesses a series of four nested mir-
rors that are specially angled to reflect X-rays. Observations are made with 
one of two instruments, either the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer or 
the High Resolution Camera. The spacecraft has a highly elliptical orbit that 
takes it out to one-third of the distance to the Moon at its farthest point. This 
orbit allows it to spend much of its time outside the Van Allen radiation belts 
that protect the Earth from harmful radiation. However, this orbit also means 
Chandra can’t be visited by the Space Shuttle.
Chandra was officially designed as a five-year mission, but it’s still going 
strong nine years after launch. Astronomers estimate that the observa-
tory could last for up to 15 years, giving it another 6 years to contribute to 
humans’ understanding of the universe.

The observatory was named after Indian astrophysicist Subrahmanyan 
Chandrasekhar. Frequently called by the less-formal moniker Chandra, he was 
widely regarded as a preeminent physicist who was one of the first to apply 
the principles of physics to astronomy. His studies of the stars earned him a 
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983.
The Spitzer Space Telescope Heats 
Things Up (2003–2009)
Infrared telescopes, such as the Spitzer Space Telescope, are a great 
addition to the study of space because they detect and measure the heat 
(infrared energy) given off by objects within certain wavelengths. The view 
of telescopes that operate at visible wavelengths (such as the Hubble Space 
Telescope, which we cover earlier in this chapter) is frequently blocked by 
gas, dust, and other obstructions; infrared telescopes like Spitzer, on the 
other hand, can see through the haze and yield brand-new information from 
deep galaxies, new stars, and other objects that can’t be seen through con-
ventional means.
Infrared radiation, or radiation that falls along the electromagnetic spectrum 
between visible light and microwave radiation, may be best known for its use 
in night-vision goggles. With that in mind, thinking of Spitzer as the world’s 
biggest and most-expensive set of night-vision goggles isn’t entirely off-base!
Spitzer (shown in Figure 18-3) was launched aboard a Delta II rocket in 2003 
and is expected to function through mid-2009. In the following sections, we 
explain how Spitzer works and why it needs to keep cool in order to function.

 Chapter 18: What a View! Telescopes in Space
 
The Spitzer Space Telescope was named after Lyman Spitzer, who first pro-
posed the idea of a space telescope in the 1940s.
Capturing heated images of the cosmos
The Spitzer Space Telescope is equipped with three main instruments that 
are sensitive enough to take the most-detailed and farthest-reaching infra-
red images ever seen. The instruments themselves provide additional data, 
including broad views of the sky at a series of different near-infrared and mid-
infrared wavelengths; mid-infrared observations in narrow wavelength ranges 
(for determining the chemical composition of the object being observed); 
and measurements of dust distribution in the galaxy.
 
Spitzer has taken a variety of stunningly beautiful images of the cosmos, 
which are also scientifically indispensible (check out an image for yourself 
in Figure 18-4). As a complement to Hubble, Spitzer has revealed the details 
of star-forming regions and extrasolar planets. It has also provided proof 
of supermassive black holes, found evidence of stars that could’ve formed 
shortly after the Big Bang, and provided new details about the structure of the 
center of the Milky Way Galaxy.

Part IV: Current Space Exploration 
Keeping Spitzer cool
Because an infrared telescope detects heat, the telescope itself must remain 
as cold as possible to perform its observations, and even in the cold, dark 
vacuum of space, extra cooling is required. Spitzer keeps itself cool with the 
aid of a cryostat, a device that uses a helium tank to lower the telescope detec-
tor’s temperature. The cryostat is capable of keeping the telescope cool for 
the expected life span of Spitzer’s mission. Solar shields on the spacecraft also 
help, but it’s a good idea to keep the telescope as far away from the hot, bright 
Earth as possible (while still leaving it able to do the work it needs to do).
Scientists sent Spitzer into an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit, which means 
that the telescope follows Earth in its orbit around the Sun instead of orbit-
ing around the Earth itself. A natural cooling effect is one benefit of this orbit, 
because the spacecraft is relatively far away from the heat-emanating Earth; 
as a result, the mission was able to reduce the amount of coolant it had to 
carry. The helium onboard Spitzer is expected to be used up sometime in 
2009, at which time the telescope will only be able to operate in a “warm” 
mode with just one of its instruments.
Looking to the Future: The James Webb 
Space Telescope
An infrared project that’s planned but not yet launched is the James Webb 
Space Telescope (JWST). Scheduled for liftoff in 2013, the mission goals of 
JWST are to use infrared technology to help locate the oldest galaxies in the 
universe. Such information would help scientists connect the dots between 
the beginning of the universe, the Big Bang theory, and the Milky Way Galaxy. 
JWST will be capable of studying early to recent solar systems, and ultimately, 
it’ll be able to help demonstrate how solar systems like ours were formed.
Fast facts about the Spitzer Space Telescope
Following are the basic facts about the Spitzer 
Space Telescope:
 ✓ Launch date and site: August 25, 2003; Cape 
Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida
 ✓ Spacecraft name and mass at launch:

 ✓ Launch vehicle: Delta II rocket
 ✓ Number of solar orbits: 5, as of this writing
 ✓ Mission duration: 5 years to date

271
 Chapter 18: What a View! Telescopes in Space
The design for the telescope is quite grand: The main mirror measures 21 feet 
(6.5 meters) in diameter (although the overall mass of JWST will be smaller 
than Hubble). The sheer size of the mirror means JWST must be launched in 
a folded state and opened up after the telescope makes it into orbit. Several 
other new technologies will help JWST gather significant data, and like the 
Spitzer infrared telescope described in the previous section, JWST will 
require cooling mechanisms in order to maintain its effectiveness.
 
The JWST mission is officially being planned by NASA, the Canadian Space 
Agency, and the European Space Agency, but its data will be valuable to scien-
tists worldwide. For more info, visit www.jwst.nasa.gov.

The International Space Station
In This Chapter
▶ Making preparations for the International Space Station
▶ Scoping out the station’s parts
▶ Constructing the station and conducting experiments in space
▶ Guessing how long the International Space Station will last
T
he world’s preeminent space research facility, the International Space 
Station (ISS), is a modularized structure that orbits about 217 miles (350 
kilometers) above the Earth. At its conception, the ISS’s main goals were to 
establish the world’s first continuous human presence in space and provide a 
permanent lab for conducting space research. It’s a mammoth example 
of global cooperation because many nations worked together to make it 
possible.
The ISS continues the research begun by earlier space stations, such as the 
various Salyut stations, Skylab, and Mir (see Chapters 12 and 13 for details on 
these early space stations). It’s one of the most technologically advanced — and 
most expensive — construction projects in human history. Although budget 
realities have scaled back the station many times, the current incarnation of 
the ISS features several lab modules and an astronaut habitat.
In this chapter, we walk you through the beginnings and the future of the 
ISS. We also describe the station’s layout and the important work being done 
inside it.

Part IV: Current Space Exploration 
Planning the International Space Station
Space Shuttle missions can fulfill short-term scientific, technical, and political 
goals (as you find out in Chapters 13 and 14), but to really establish a pres-
ence in space, NASA engineers and scientists realized that a destination was 
crucial. During the Apollo years of the 1960s and 1970s, the Moon was the 
destination of choice. In the 1970s and 1980s, Skylab and the various Salyut 
stations were short-term destinations for Soviet and American crews. Finally, 
Mir became the site of joint missions in the mid-1980s and into the 1990s.
 
The International Space Station (ISS), however, was conceived as a first step 
toward a continuous human presence in space and a step toward the future 
of humans as a space-faring race. It was established early on that a permanent 
orbital base would greatly facilitate exploration of the rest of the solar system 
(largely by serving as a “way station” for other destinations), in addition to 
providing a way to discover more about human survival in space. Following 
experience gained from Mir and Skylab, both Russia and the U.S. began plan-
ning more-advanced, modular space stations that could support larger crews 
with enhanced research opportunities; both countries, however, suffered 
from design and financial setbacks. With Cold War secrecy and competition 
no longer an obstacle, Russia and the U.S. (along with Europe, Japan, and 
Canada) agreed to pool economic and intellectual resources toward the cre-
ation of a common space station project, eventually named the International 
Space Station.
ISS partner countries include
 
✓ Belgium
 
✓ Brazil
 
✓ Canada
 
✓ Denmark
 
✓ France
 
✓ Germany
 
✓ Italy
 
✓ Japan
 
✓ The Netherlands
 
✓ Norway

✓ Sweden

Saying you’re going to work together with multiple nations to construct a 
space station is great, but actually constructing that station requires a lot of 
prep work, as the ISS partner countries soon found out. Here are some of the 
factors the various nations had to consider as they worked to make the ISS a 
reality:

275
 Chapter 19: A Symbol of Global Cooperation: The International Space Station
 
✓ Protection: National security concerns were foremost, but proprietary 
engineering documents and other intellectual property also needed to 
be protected.
 
✓ Compatibility of parts: The countries had to work very closely together 
to make sure their modules and equipment would all fit together and 
work smoothly, despite country-to-country differences in typical electri-
cal voltages and even units of measurement.
 
✓ Ownership: The partner nations had an important question to answer: 
Would astronauts from different countries be allowed onboard the ISS 
only in direct proportion to how much their country contributed to 
the construction costs? Political tact wound up playing a large role in 
the granting of credit and privileges. Russia, for example, demanded 
major access to the completed ISS because its scientists and engineers 
contributed substantial knowledge and experience in the area of human 
spaceflight.
 
✓ The watchful public eye: The ISS provided an unimaginable wealth of 
worldwide publicity possibilities, and the people in charge of the sta-
tion’s design were acutely aware of the potential that every decision — 
good or bad — could make front-page news.
Touring the International Space Station
Crews aboard the International Space Station (ISS) have everything they need 
to live and work in their home away from home. In the following sections, we 
describe the overall layout of the ISS and the latest ’n’ largest addition to the 
station: Japan’s Kibo lab. (Be sure to check out an image of the ISS in all its 
glory in the color section.)
The piece-by-piece construction 
(1998–present)
Since 1998, a mix of Soyuz rockets, Proton rockets, and the Space Shuttle has 
launched various components of the ISS into orbit. In fact, ISS assembly mis-
sions have become the Space Shuttle’s primary mission. Space Shuttle flights 
have been largely devoted to ISS construction since 2000, and the end of the 
Shuttle program in 2010 is currently arranged to coincide with the antici-
pated completion of the ISS in 2011 (which includes a final launch of some 
components on an unmanned rocket). Afterward, the ISS will be serviced by 
Russian Soyuz capsules and automated supply ships. (Check out the Space 
Shuttle approaching the ISS in Figure 19-1.)
When completed, the ISS will be composed of 15 modules joined together. 
The modules currently in orbit are described in Table 19-1.

elements.
The newest (and biggest) addition: 
Japan’s Kibo lab
Various countries have supplied astronauts, equipment, and modules to 
the ISS to help further scientific research and exploration in space. One of 
the more recent successes in the area of international cooperation is the 
Japanese Experiment Module, called Kibo in Japanese (see Figure 19-3). This

In keeping with the theme of modular space station development, Kibo has 
four main parts:
 
✓ Pressurized Module: The place where astronauts work and perform 
experiments. Supplies, equipment, power sources, thermal controls, 
and other requirements for effective research are housed here. The 
Pressurized Module also features an Experiment Logistics Module, 
which provides additional storage for experiment racks.
 
✓ Exposed Facility: An area for work outside of the space station. 
Astronauts can send and receive equipment and info straight to the 
Pressurized Module through an airlock. An Experiment Logistics Module 
also is located in this section.
 
✓ Remote Manipulator System: A set of two robotic arms that can move 
heavy payloads between modules. It’s controlled from inside the 
Pressurized Module.
 
✓ Inter-Orbit Communication System: A system that coordinates the 
exchange of data between Kibo and Japanese scientists.
Kibo was built in Japan and shipped to Florida to await its launch. Three 
Space Shuttle missions are required to completely transport and assemble it:
 
✓ The first part of Kibo was launched to the ISS aboard Space Shuttle 
Endeavour on mission STS-123 on March 11, 2008; the second part was 
launched aboard Space Shuttle Discovery on mission STS-124 on May 21, 
2008. These two launches brought parts of the Pressurized Module to 
the ISS.
 
✓ The remainder of Kibo is scheduled for launch (likely aboard Space 
Shuttle Endeavour) on mission STS-127, currently planned for 2009.
When fully assembled, the Kibo module will be the biggest component of the 
ISS. Its Pressurized Module (which is the main “indoors” working area) mea-
sures 36.7 feet (11.2 meters) by 14.4 feet (4.4 meters). Within it, astronauts 
can conduct experiments in areas such as X-ray astronomy, biology, and 
communications. Kibo experiments are run from the Tsukuba Space Center 
in Japan.
 
Great hopes are placed on Kibo — and not just because the word kibo means 
“hope” in Japanese — because it’s the newest lab, one that contains signifi-
cantly improved equipment for the ISS researchers and represents a major 
milestone for Japanese achievements in space research.

The International Space Station (ISS) has been home to at least one crew (or 
expedition, as ISS crews are officially known) since 2000. The first crew con-
sisted of Commander Bill Shepherd, Soyuz Commander Yuri Gidzenko, and 
Flight Engineer Sergei Krikalev. Due to the station’s current size, ISS crews 
consist of just three people, but eventually the ISS will be able to support six 
individuals, thanks to extra living space and life-support systems installed 
during a 2008 Space Shuttle mission. (Check out a team of astronauts aboard 
the ISS in Figure 19-4.)

The Expedition 1 crew traveled to the ISS in a Russian Soyuz rocket and 
remained in orbit for 135 days. Subsequent teams have journeyed to the ISS 
via the Space Shuttle or a Soyuz rocket and spent increasing amounts of time 
in space. The most-recent crew, Expedition 18, reached the ISS in the fall of 
2008 and will remain aboard it until the spring of 2009.
In the following sections, we describe a few of the major tasks that astronauts 
handle aboard the ISS — namely, constructing and maintaining the station, 
taking care of their health, and conducting scientific experiments.

281
 Chapter 19: A Symbol of Global Cooperation: The International Space Station
Maintaining the station’s and 
the astronauts’ health
The ISS is the most health conscious place in all of space. After all, the men 
and women aboard it must constantly check on and maintain the opera-
tional health of the station (as well as their own health). The ISS astronauts 
spend considerable time doing construction work and maintenance on their 
habitat. An estimated 960 hours per year are required to build the station in 
space and keep it running; about 160 of those hours are spent on spacewalks 
(extravehicular activities, or EVAs, performed in space). Because spacewalks 
require two crew members, that comes out to about 2,000 hours of crew 
work.
When they’re not performing upkeep on the station (or conducting experi-
ments, as described in the next section), astronauts aboard the ISS spend 
time caring for themselves. They aim to sleep a reasonable amount each 
evening and fit in exercise sessions throughout the day to try and mitigate 
the loss of muscle tone and bone mass that comes in space. Treadmills and 
specially designed resistance training equipment (such as the Resistive 
Exercise Device, a machine that uses vacuum cylinders rather than weights) 
are expected to be used for about two hours daily by each astronaut.
Although astronauts can conceivably become ill aboard the ISS, they’re care-
fully screened for infections before making the journey. And sure, bacteria 
and fungi are bound to grow wherever humans are involved, but the ISS 
astronauts use advanced tests to locate the areas that require extra cleaning. 
In addition to cleaning the station, personal hygiene also occupies more time 
in orbit than it does on the ground. Fortunately for the crew, taking showers 
on the ISS is a lot easier than on early space stations (long-duration crews 
on the early Salyut stations had an entire day devoted to bathing, which 
included heating up the water one small pot at a time).
 
One of the more interesting aspects of living in orbit has to do with micrograv-
ity, the very low-gravity environment found in orbit around the Earth. Thanks 
to this lovely phenomenon, even ordinary tasks, such as writing with a pen or 
walking across the room, take on an entirely different meaning (like when the 
pen floats away and walking is really more like flying). It takes time for astro-
nauts to get used to the fact that they’re no longer weighted down by gravity. 
Imagine getting up in the morning and, rather than standing for a stretch, 
whacking your head on the ceiling!

282
Part IV: Current Space Exploration 
Conducting science experiments
Three of the ISS’s ten currently active modules are laboratory modules, each 
of which is capable of supporting studies in biology, physics, meteorology, 
and astronomy. Most of the lab science at the ISS currently takes place in the 
NASA-made Destiny module, which has been in space since 2000. This lab 
measures 14 feet (4.3 meters) by 28 feet (8.5 meters) and is pressurized to 
allow for full human occupation. Racks provide space and equipment for run-
ning ducts, wires, pipes, and other necessities throughout the lab.
 
Biology experiments take a high priority on the ISS, because how the human 
body performs long-term in space is of the utmost interest for future missions 
to the Moon, Mars, or beyond. Astronauts study bone density, muscle tone, 
and other aspects of the human anatomy as they change in microgravity. 
Other experiments on the physics side of things help solve the mysteries of 
how fluids behave in space, as well as in examining the effect of low gravity on 
fluids and fluid combinations.
Waste not, want not
Because the limited confines of the Space 
Shuttle and the Soyuz spacecraft prevent them 
from transporting waste from the ISS back to 
Earth, ISS waste products are recycled when-
ever possible. In late 2008, astronauts installed 
a new high-tech filter system that recycles 
waste water, including urine, into clean drink-
ing water. All nonreusable supplies, including 
water, must be launched from the ground, so 
being able to recycle water frees up cargo 
space for other essential items.
In cases where objects (such as old equip-
ment, food containers, used clothes, and 
human waste) can’t be reused in any capacity, 
they must be discarded to make room inside 
the modules for the crew and equipment. Too 
much stuff inside the ISS means more work for 
the astronauts because they have to spend time 
and precious energy hustling trash rather than 
working.
In between dockings, the station’s trash must be 
compressed and stored for eventual transport. 
It must be tempting just to throw all that trash 
overboard, but ejecting garbage from the ISS 
is done quite carefully, considering any objects 
that head back toward the ISS could become 
dangerous missiles. Although astronauts 
aboard the former Mir space station ejected 
bags full of trash, ISS crew members generally 
pack unmanned Progress supply ships with 
garbage after removing the new supplies. The 
Progress ship is then sent on an Earth-bound 
trajectory where much of the module burns up 
in orbit; any remaining debris is targeted to fall 
into a designated dumping zone in the middle of 
the Pacific Ocean, far from land.

 Chapter 19: A Symbol of Global Cooperation: The International Space Station
 
Crystal growth in microgravity is studied for its ability to teach scientists 
about the physical properties of particular chemical solutions. The value of 
growing these tiny crystals in space is that gravity doesn’t disturb or impact 
their growth, meaning their structure can be observed in a purer fashion. The 
crystals are then brought back to Earth for study in laboratories. Growing 
pure crystals allows their physical properties to be studied in detail in Earth-
bound laboratories, which may lead to the development of new materials and 
better medicines.
Predicting the Future of the 
International Space Station
The International Space Station (ISS) is scheduled for completion by 2010, the 
year the last of the current Space Shuttles will fly to the ISS with the neces-
sary parts (although an unmanned Russian Proton rocket may bring some 
remaining components to the ISS in late 2011). After the Space Shuttle is 
Controversy in space: The U.S. nearly backed out 
of the International Space Station
As the ultimate symbol of international agree-
ment, it would seem a foregone conclusion 
that all countries involved and committed to the 
International Space Station would remain so. 
Not necessarily! In 2005, it appeared that the 
U.S. was on the verge of gradually withdrawing 
from the ISS project, due in part to its increas-
ing commitments to other areas of space 
exploration. In addition, there was a great deal 
of skepticism about the longevity of the Space 
Shuttle program following the disintegration of 
Space Shuttle Columbia in 2003 (as explained 
in Chapter 5).
However, the U.S. kept up its end of the bargain. 
Why?
 ✓ There was ultimately little choice, given 
that Space Shuttle flights are the only way 
to deliver essential ISS components and 
modules. No other spacecraft are large or 
powerful enough to lift certain space sta-
tion components into orbit.
 ✓ America made a commitment to other 
nations in terms of money, time, effort, man-
power, and heart. Backing out of supporting 
the ISS could’ve been interpreted as a fla-
grant violation of this partnership, and other 
space agencies (the Japan Aerospace 
Exploration Agency and the European 
Space Agency in particular) have invested 
quite a bit of money in modules, cargo, and 
other supplies that are scheduled for future 
launch to the ISS.
 ✓ Future goodwill is another consideration — 
America’s quest to return to the Moon will 
undoubtedly require cooperation from other 
nations, and burning that goodwill now can 
only damage America’s credibility later.

284
Part IV: Current Space Exploration 
retired, the Russian Soyuz spacecraft will serve as the only access to the ISS 
until NASA’s new Orion spacecraft (which we tell you all about in Chapter 21) 
takes flight several years later.
How long the station will last is a question on the minds of many. Generally 
speaking, each module in the ISS can last as long as its parts and equipment 
are functional and safe. Certain pieces can be replaced as needed, but the 
overall life span of the ISS will depend on how long its components remain 
in operational condition. Factors affecting that life span include radiation 
damage, extreme temperatures, and other conditions unique to space that 
may make the metal components wear faster than they would on Earth.
 
Officially, the ISS is expected to last no longer than 2015. Practically speaking, 
many items used in space have lasted long past their anticipated expiration 
dates, but remember that the ISS has many different ages. The first modules, 
in place since 1998, were originally rated with a 15-year life span, but more-
recent modules were added 10 years later (and came with similar life spans). 
As of this writing, no nation has officially committed to the ISS beyond 2015, 
and no specific plans have been made public as to what will happen to the ISS 
after that time.
Though regarded as an embarrassing waste of money by some, the com-
pleted ISS will be a capable orbital laboratory. However, its future may 
depend more on political, rather than engineering or scientific, concerns. 
In 2004, President George W. Bush urged NASA to focus on a human return 
to the Moon with future missions to Mars — a move that largely supplanted 
the ISS because it moved the space agency’s focus beyond Earth orbit. 
Regardless, the ISS is a tremendous technological and political achieve-
ment that continues to bring the space agencies of many different countries 
together to build a very complex piece of technology. Lessons learned from 
collaborating and operating the ISS will be very useful for the next phase of 
space exploration, whatever that stage may be. Keeping the ISS in working 
order for as long as possible will only further those goals.

Mars Odyssey: Searching for Water and 
Sending Signals (2001–Present)
 
Mars Odyssey, which reached Mars orbit in 2001, was the first robotic space-
craft to successfully reach Mars in the 21st century. Its purpose? To start 
looking for evidence of volcanic activity and water on the surface of Mars. 
Perhaps the spacecraft’s most-significant finding is the existence of places 
on the Martian surface that may hold chloride minerals such as salt — the 

286
Part IV: Current Space Exploration 
current presence of salt may indicate the previous presence of liquid water. 
Additionally, data gathered by Mars Odyssey has revealed concentrations of 
hydrogen that are thought to indicate near-surface water, which could indi-
cate the more-recent presence of habitable locations on the Red Planet.
A repeat of many experiments on the failed Mars Climate Orbiter (described in 
Chapter 15), Mars Odyssey was also designed to relay communications from 
future Mars landers. Because landers typically rely on an orbiting spacecraft 
to relay their info all the way back to Earth, having Mars Odyssey around for 
this purpose is critical.
 
Mars Odyssey uses three main instruments to take its measurements. THEMIS 
(Thermal Emission Imaging System) takes near-infrared pictures to study sur-
face composition; MARIE (Mars Radiation Environment Experiment) studies 
the Red Planet’s radiation environment; and GRS (Gamma Ray Spectrometer) 
looks for hydrogen on the surface, which could indicate the presence of water 
(or ice) below the surface.
The Mars Odyssey spacecraft fulfilled its mission goals as planned in 2001 and 
helped relay the vast majority of images from three different Mars landers. 
Because the spacecraft and its equipment were still functioning (and because 
Mars Odyssey was already out in space) NASA officials decided to extend the 
Mars Odyssey mission through 2010 to allow the spacecraft to study climate 
phenomena, such as ice and dust, and continue relaying information from 
other Mars missions.

Mars Express: A Bittersweet European 
Effort (2003–Present)
In 2003, the European Space Agency (ESA) got into the act of Mars explora-
tion with its ambitious Mars Express mission. Intended to send both a lander 
and an orbiter to study the geology and biology of Mars, Mars Express was 
also charged with taking climactic and atmospheric measurements and inves-
tigating the Martian surface and subsurface. (It also served as the basis for 
Venus Express, an ESA mission that launched successfully in 2005, as you can 
read about in Chapter 16).
Like other spacecraft that traveled to Mars, Mars Express didn’t go empty-
handed. It had a hefty science payload (cargo, such as experiments and 
equipment) that included infrared and visible spectrometers for measuring 
thermal emissions, a radar altimeter for measuring surface height, and a 
camera for capturing stereo images of the Martian surface to make three-
dimensional views.
The spacecraft left Earth on June 2, 2003, via a Soyuz/Fregat launch vehicle 
(thanks to an agreement with the Russian Federal Space Agency). It arrived 
at Mars on December 25 and successfully launched the lander, called Beagle 
2 after Charles Darwin’s famous ship. Beagle 2 managed to descend into 
the Martian atmosphere, but it stopped communicating with Earth immedi-
ately afterward and was officially declared lost. The landing site chosen for 
Beagle 2 was the Isidis Planitia, an area where scientists had been hoping to 
search for signs of life. The site wasn’t a particularly dangerous one, as far as 
planetary landings go, and scientists speculate that Beagle 2 may have been 
irreparably damaged during landing if the atmosphere on Mars was thinner 
than expected due to recent dust storms.
 
Despite the failure of Beagle 2 to land on Mars, the Mars Express orbiter 
reached orbit successfully and has been returning valuable scientific images 
and measurements since 2004, including new information about the types and 
abundances of minerals on the Martian surface. Two of the mission’s most-
amazing scientific results to date are its beautiful three-dimensional stereo 
views of Mars’s surface (see Figure 20-1) and its unexpected detection of 
methane on the Red Planet’s surface. This detection was unexpected because 
on Earth, methane usually comes from biological sources; as far as we know, 
there is no life on Mars, so finding methane there was something of a surprise! 
Methane is unstable at the surface of Mars, which means it doesn’t last very 
long. The discovery of methane on Mars means that a source must be cur-
rently supplying it, which in turn implies that there’s some sort of activity, 
geologic or otherwise, on Mars right this very moment.

Roving with Spirit and Opportunity 
(2003–Present)
The ability to move around on the surface of Mars has revolutionized peo-
ple’s understanding of the wide variety of environments present on the Red 
Planet. Lessons learned from the tiny yet successful Sojourner rover (see 
Chapter 15) helped NASA engineers design the two Mars Exploration Rovers 
(MER): Spirit and Opportunity. These rovers are fully mobile, solar-powered 
labs capable of sending their data to an orbiting spacecraft for relay back to 
Earth. If necessary, they can even contact Earth directly from the Martian 
surface. (See Figure 20-2 for a close-up glimpse of a Mars Exploration Rover.)
 
Figure 20-2:

conception

Rover.

The initial goals of the MER mission were to explore and start defining the 
surface characteristics of Mars. NASA wanted information on the rocks, min-
erals, and soil found at the rovers’ targeted landing sites so scientists could 
determine how these geologic features may have been created. Of particular 
interest was the search for specific rock types and compositions that could 
only have been formed in the presence of liquid water. The significance of 
that? Where there once was water, there could once have been life too.
Spirit (also known by the far more boring name of MER-A) launched on a 
Delta II rocket on June 10, 2003, followed by Opportunity (also known as 
MER-B) on July 7, 2003. (Opportunity left Earth on a more heavy-duty ver-
sion of the Delta II because it launched a month later than Spirit, and the 
Earth-Sun-Mars alignment required more from the rocket to make it to Mars.) 
Spirit landed on Mars first, hitting the large Gusev Crater on January 4, 2004. 
Opportunity followed on January 24, 2004, landing in the Meridiani Planum.

290
Part IV: Current Space Exploration 
 
The rovers are designed to do just about everything a geologist would do if 
he or she were to walk the surface of Mars. Cameras mounted to them take 
360-degree panoramic images of the Red Planet’s terrain, and robotic arms 
extend instruments in order to touch and study rocks up close. Both rovers 
are capable of grinding the surfaces of rocks to expose fresh, new material 
that can then be scanned for thermal emissions and bombarded with X-rays to 
determine the rocks’ composition.
From orbit, Spirit’s landing site in Gusev Crater looked like a geologic wonder-
land of features formed by water. However, once on the ground, Spirit found 
rock after rock that had been formed by volcanic, not fluvial (flowing liquid), 
processes. It turned out that any water-related features in Gusev Crater had 
long ago been covered over by lava flows. Fortunately, Spirit’s ability to travel 
long distances meant that it could be directed toward some interesting-looking 
hills in the distance (dubbed the Columbia Hills after the lost Space Shuttle; see 
Chapter 5). Spirit has spent the past several years traveling to and exploring a 
series of cliffs that reveal different rock types, including silica-rich deposits that 
could come from ancient hot springs, driving almost five miles in the process.
Opportunity’s landing site, by contrast, had geologic features that seemed less 
interesting from orbit, but the appearance of large deposits of hematite was 
too good to pass up because hematite usually only forms in the presence of 
liquid water on Earth. After landing on the other side of Mars from its twin 
lander, Opportunity’s airbags rolled it into a small crater with fascinating layers 
that included small round spheres dubbed “blueberries” that turned out to 
be the mysterious hematite. Scientists used their studies of the fine details of 
these and other rock types to determine that the Meridiani Planum was once 
covered with water, a fascinating discovery that improves the chances of Mars 
once supporting life. Opportunity has spent the last five years driving more 
than eight miles across the surface of Mars, investigating a large crater called 
Victoria Crater (which you can see in Figure 20-3), among other sites.

The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in 
Action (2005–Present)
Many images of Mars have been taken from orbit, but none boast the impres-
sive degree of detail provided by the images taken from Mars Reconnaissance 
Orbiter (MRO). MRO’s mission goals were to view the surface of Mars at as 
high a resolution as possible from orbit to help NASA better understand how 
the landing sites for the rovers Spirit and Opportunity fit into the overall pic-
ture of Mars (see the previous section for details on the rovers), as well as to 
help select sites to which future missions could be directed.
MRO left Earth on August 12, 2005, and entered orbit around Mars about seven 
months later with the help of aerobraking (using the atmosphere of a planet to 
change the orbit of a spacecraft). MRO was intended as a follow-up to the Mars 
Global Surveyor mission of 1996 (see Chapter 15), and it has a wide variety 
of state-of-the-art instruments aboard, including several cameras. The HiRISE 
(High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment) camera takes extremely high-
resolution pictures of the surface that reveal tiny details; the CTX (Context 
Imager) camera helps scientists understand the geologic features seen around 
the supersmall HiRISE pictures; and MARCI (Mars Color Imager) adds lower-
resolution color images to help understand Mars’s surface composition.

292
Part IV: Current Space Exploration 
MRO isn’t just a camera machine, however. It also features instruments 
designed to perform specific scientific observations such as searching for 
subsurface water with radio waves, studying the composition of the Red 
Planet with an imaging near-infrared spectrometer, and measuring the tem-
perature and water vapor levels in the Martian atmosphere.
 
Although all of MRO’s instruments have returned important scientific results, 
the HiRISE images are the most stunning (see one for yourself in the color 
section). The HiRISE camera has revealed layered deposits near Mars’s North 
Pole that may hold data on how the planet’s climate has changed over the last 
few million years. Images of salt deposits — a key indicator of areas where 
liquid water could’ve evaporated over time — near the southern highlands 
have also been sent back. Additionally, the HiRISE camera has observed Spirit 
and Opportunity from orbit, as well as both Viking landers (see Chapter 11), 
and captured a dramatic image of the Phoenix Mars Lander while it was land-
ing (see the next section for more about Phoenix).
 
The latest updates on MRO, whose primary mission lasts until the end of 2010, 
are available at marsprogram.jpl.nasa.gov/mro. For amazing pictures

The Phoenix Mars Lander Visits the 
North Pole (2007–2008)
 
The most recent visitor to the Red Planet was the Phoenix Mars Lander, a 
robotic spacecraft sent to Mars to find definitive evidence of water. And 
find water it did! In June 2008, the lander dug a trench that was filled with a 
bright material scientists thought could’ve been ice. Several days later, the 
bright clumps had vaporized, suggesting that they were probably water ice. 
Additional evidence of water was gleaned from water vapor measurements 
sent back in late July 2008.

 Chapter 20: New Views of Mars in the New Millennium
All previous Mars landers have set down near the Martian equator, but 
Phoenix was targeted for terrain near the North Pole. Like the poles on Earth, 
both poles of Mars have ice caps, though the ice on Mars is primarily made of 
carbon dioxide rather than water. The North Pole was chosen for Phoenix’s 
landing site because the northern polar cap is larger than the southern polar 
cap (and because more water ice is thought to exist there).
The primary mission goals for Phoenix were to find water, examine the his-
tory of water on Mars, and, in the process, discover more about the mecha-
nisms of climate change. A related goal was to determine how habitable Mars 
was, or had been, as a result of the presence (or absence) of liquid water at 
various points in its history.
 
The spacecraft was dubbed Phoenix because it was said to rise from the 
ashes of the failed Mars Polar Lander spacecraft (see Chapter 15). This rising 
was largely figurative but partly literal — some spare instruments from Polar 
Lander were used in Phoenix.
The Phoenix Mars Mission launched successfully on August 4, 2007. The 
lander made it to Mars on May 25, 2008, setting down in Vastitas Borealis 
(one of the areas that promised a high concentration of water ice). Initial 
pictures showed a flat surface scattered with pebbles and polygonal cracks 
thought to be due to the freezing and thawing of ice just below the surface.
Unlike the previous few Mars missions, Phoenix was a stationary lander 
rather than a rover. Because the lander itself couldn’t move, one of its most 
important tools was a robotic arm that could dig about 1.5 feet (0.5 meters) 
into the surface of Mars, bringing up soil and ice samples that could then be 
analyzed and studied. A scoop on the end of the robotic arm (see Figure 20-4) 
delivered soil samples into a variety of chemical analysis tools aboard the 
spacecraft, which wetted and heated the soil to perform various composi-
tional analyses.

Phoenix’s wet chemistry lab, MECA (the Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and 
Conductivity Analyzer), provided the means for soil samples to be baked, 
imaged, and doused with chemicals — all in the interest of determining more 
about the soil’s composition. For example, it found that the soil contained 
minerals such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium.
Phoenix was intended to last for 90 days following its landing on Mars, but 
it managed to survive an extra two months before diminishing light levels in 
the region reduced the amount of available sunlight below operating levels 
for the spacecraft’s solar panels. NASA’s last contact with Phoenix came 
on November 2, 2008. It’s possible that the spacecraft can survive the cold 
Martian winter and emerge from its safe mode during Martian spring, in 2009, 
but because the spacecraft will be covered by frozen carbon dioxide (dry 
ice) for many months, mission designers think that another resurrection for 
Phoenix is unlikely.

Part V
The Future of 
Space Exploration

In this part . . .
P
art V deals with the future of space exploration. A 
whole fleet of exciting robotic missions is in the pipe-
line from NASA and other countries’ space agencies. These 
missions include advanced journeys to Mars; a return to 
Jupiter; and treks to Pluto, Mercury, and the asteroids. On 
the astronaut side o’ things, the venerable Space Shuttle is 
headed on its last few missions and will soon be replaced 
with Project Constellation’s Orion, a capsule-based system 
that will allow astronauts to journey to the International 
Space Station and eventually return to the Moon and travel 
to Mars.
You may be surprised to find out that space travel is no 
longer the sole province of astronauts. Space tourism has 
allowed private citizens to fly in space — for a price. 
Commercial space travel will undoubtedly take on an 
important role in the future.
We conclude this part with a look at the reasons for space 
exploration, from a philosophical view of the frontier to 
the necessity of expansion given the finite resources here 
on Earth.

n earlier parts of this book, we describe a great number of past and pres-
ent missions, but space exploration is far from finished. Many exciting 
developments are in store for the future of both human and robotic explora-
tion of the solar system:
 
✓ On the human exploration side, President George W. Bush’s vision for 
space exploration guided NASA to plan for a return to the Moon in prep-
aration for human exploration of Mars. To meet these goals, the Space 
Shuttle will be retired, and the new Orion spacecraft will take over.
 
✓ On the robotic side, the upcoming car-sized Mars Science Lab will per-
form a modern search for life on Mars, and a new Outer Planets Flagship 
Mission will travel to the Jupiter system. A number of robotic missions 
to the Moon are also either underway or planned for launch in the next 
few years.
Other interesting missions are also on their way courtesy of the United States 
and other nations. We give you the goods on what to watch for in this chapter.
Recommitting to Human Exploration with 
NASA’s Project Constellation
The Space Shuttle has had a long and celebrated career as the first reus-
able spacecraft able to bring astronauts and cargo to Earth orbit (check out 
Chapters 13 and 14 for details). However, with the International Space Station 

298
Part V: The Future of Space Exploration 
nearing completion and targets beyond Earth beckoning, the development of 
a new human spacecraft is long overdue.
With an American return to the Moon, and an eventual destination of Mars, 
in mind, NASA engineers were faced with the challenge of developing a new 
launch vehicle and spacecraft for human space exploration. The resulting 
effort, called Project Constellation, includes the Orion spacecraft (formerly 
known as the Crew Exploration Vehicle) and the Ares I rocket, as well as Ares 
V, a heavy-lift launcher that will bring nonhuman payloads (cargo) into orbit. 
We describe all three components of Project Constellation (as well as the end 
of the Shuttle program and the basics of how second-generation lunar explo-
ration will work) in the following sections.
Transitioning from the Space Shuttle
 
To make way for the development of a new spacecraft for astronauts, the 
venerable Space Shuttle program will be shut down. The final Shuttle flight is 
currently scheduled for 2010, but the first Orion flight won’t take place until 
2014 at the earliest. The gap between the two programs is unfortunate, but 
given scheduling constraints and funding considerations, keeping the Shuttle 
flying until Orion is ready to take over is very unlikely. Each Shuttle flight is 
extremely expensive, and that money — plus the money for continued ground 
support, maintenance, repairs, and more for the Shuttle — can instead be 
freed up so NASA can focus solely on Orion and Ares I.
Fortunately, the International Space Station (ISS) shouldn’t be negatively 
affected by the Space Shuttle’s retirement. A plan is already in place for the 
ISS to be visited solely by Soyuz capsules (for crew exchanges) and robotic 
Progress ships (for supplies) until Orion is ready for its first trip to the ISS in 
2014 or later. (Flip to Chapter 19 for details about the ISS.)
Introducing Orion, the next-generation 
spacecraft for human exploration
Unlike the Space Shuttle, which launches like a rocket but lands like a glider, 
the Orion spacecraft looks much more like the Apollo spacecraft (which we 
describe in Chapters 9 and 10). In fact, Orion has been called “Apollo on ste-
roids” because it’s larger and more capable than its predecessor. The resem-
blance is indeed striking — astronauts will ride into space in a small capsule 
shaped like a rounded cone, although Orion will be able to carry up to six 
astronauts compared to Apollo’s maximum capacity of three (see Figure 21-1).

 Chapter 21: More in Store: Upcoming Space Missions
 
Figure 21-1:

the Space 
Shuttle’s

ment: Orion.

Orion will launch with the help of the Ares I rocket (see the next section for 
details on Ares I). Orion’s capsule will either land on solid ground with para-
chutes and airbags, similar to the Russian Soyuz spacecraft that we describe 
in Chapter 7, or it’ll return to Earth via Apollo-style water landings. Ground 
landings are more technically difficult, but they also don’t require the sup-
port of an entire Navy fleet to retrieve the astronauts. NASA is currently 
leaning toward a water landing for Orion, but the final decision has yet to be 
made as of this writing.
 
The Orion spacecraft will be completely reusable for up to ten spaceflights 
per capsule, whereas the Ares launch vehicle will be only partially reusable. 
Orion will have a crew module (more than twice the size of Apollo’s Command 
Module) in which the astronauts will ride for takeoff and landing. This capsule 
will return to Earth after each mission. Similar to Apollo, Orion will also have a 
service module for supplies and equipment, but the Orion version will deploy 
solar panels when it reaches space so as to reduce the amount of fuel the 
spacecraft has to carry.
Lifting off with the Ares I 
and Ares V rockets
The U.S. space program has used various rockets for propelling spacecraft 
into space over its 50-year history, but none have ever been as powerful and 
efficient as the new Ares models.

300
Part V: The Future of Space Exploration 
Ares I (shown on the right in Figure 21-2) consists of two stages:
 
✓ The first stage is a solid rocket booster similar to that found on the 
Space Shuttle, but it’s more powerful and able to burn longer. This solid 
rocket booster stage is reusable.
 
✓ The second stage is a J2-X rocket engine that uses liquid hydrogen and 
liquid oxygen as its propellant. This engine is similar to the one used on 
Project Apollo’s Saturn V Moon rocket (see Chapter 9). The big differ-
ence is that it’ll be able to start both in vacuum and in a planet or satel-
lite’s atmosphere.
 
Figure 21-2: 
Designs for 
the Ares I 
(right) and 
Ares V (left) 
rockets.

The Apollo spacecraft and the Space Shuttle were singular spacecraft that 
brought both cargo and astronauts into space. Now that model’s a way of the 
past. As part of Project Constellation, NASA officials have decided to split the 
cargo capability off from the human spaceflight system. Orion will carry only 
crew and necessary life-support systems into space. Cargo, such as supplies 
and possible future ISS modules, will be brought into space aboard two-stage 
Ares V rockets (shown on the left in Figure 21-2). Splitting functions between 
crew and cargo allows the design of each spacecraft to better address the 
needs of its occupants, in addition to reducing some of the hardware costs. 
The cargo rocket will also launch lunar modules and spacecraft to take future 

301
 Chapter 21: More in Store: Upcoming Space Missions
astronauts from Earth orbit to the Moon. (Check out Figure 3-1 in Chapter 3 to 
see the size of the Ares I and Ares V rockets as compared to the Space Shuttle, 
Saturn V, and other rockets.)
Flying to the Moon (again)
People want to go back to the Moon. That’s just fine and dandy, you may 
think, but is there a plan in place? Never fear, reader dear! NASA’s current 
plans for a human return to the Moon begin with the launch of astronauts 
aboard Orion via the Ares I rocket. Separately, an Ares V rocket will launch a 
payload into space that includes the Earth Departure Stage (EDS; a powerful 
rocket stage designed to be launched separately from the Orion spacecraft 
only to be united with it in orbit in order to propel the spacecraft toward the 
Moon), as well as a brand-new lunar module (the Altair Lunar Lander). Once 
in orbit, Orion will dock with the EDS and use the EDS’s rocket engines to 
send the whole spacecraft on its journey to the Moon. After the crew arrives 
at the Moon, it’ll either send the EDS off into solar orbit or intentionally send 
it to crash into the Moon in order to study the seismic waves raised by the 
impact.
Astronauts will use the Altair Lunar Lander to physically land on the Moon. 
Altair will be larger and more capable than Apollo’s Lunar Module. In one 
possible mission configuration, a four-person crew will be able to land on the 
surface, leaving the Orion spacecraft operating all by its lonesome in orbit as 
it awaits the return of Altair.
 
Other differences between Altair and Apollo’s Lunar Module include
 
✓ An airlock (for keeping pesky Moon dust out of the rest of the spacecraft 
and sparing the astronauts from having to depressurize the entire lander 
before a moonwalk)
 
✓ A toilet similar to those on the International Space Station
 
✓ The ability to heat up food for hungry moonwalkers
Altair will be able to support a mission to the lunar surface of up to a week’s 
duration, after which it’ll blast off from the lunar surface and dock with Orion 
for the journey back to Earth.
 
Orion’s first Moon landing is currently set for 2018, but this date will likely slip 
farther into the future if technological, political, and budgetary constraints 
arise. After 21st century Moon landings have been thoroughly established, 
the next step will be to send astronauts on a much longer trip to Mars and/
or a near-Earth asteroid. Lessons learned from humanity’s return to the Moon 
will likely result in changes to Orion, but by that time, being confined to Earth 
orbit will be a mere memory.

Revving Up Future Robotic Exploration
Humans may be headed back to the Moon, but robotic explorers of the not-
so-distant future will travel both near (to the Moon) and far (to Pluto, the 
celestial body formerly known as the ninth planet). NASA’s planned robotic 
spacecraft will be joined by an innovative fleet from a number of other coun-
tries, some of which are launching their own solar system explorers for the 
first time.
 
Robotic missions serve as both an essential precursor to future human explo-
ration, in the case of the Moon and Mars, and humanity’s emissaries to loca-
tions that are too far away, or too dangerous, to send people to anytime soon.
Rekindling interest in the Moon
 
The Moon has long been a fascinating space exploration destination for 
Americans and Europeans alike. Now Asian nations are delving into lunar sci-
ence as well. More and more countries are making the foray into lunar explo-
ration for several reasons, including the fact that significant international 
prestige comes with sending spacecraft to the Moon and the knowledge and 
technology required to make such trips no longer belongs solely to the United 
States and Russia. Plus, the Moon is an exotic target that’s also close by, a per-
fect destination for a country that’s just testing the space exploration waters. 
Recent and current robotic Moon missions include the following:
 
✓ SMART-1: Launched in 2003 by the European Space Agency, SMART-1 
(an acronym for Small Missions for Advanced Research in Technology) 
was a small, lightweight, low-cost mission that studied the Moon’s 
surface composition. The spacecraft was crashed into the Moon in 
September 2006 to look for water in the impact plume.
 
 To find out more about SMART-1, visit www.esa.int/SPECIALS/
SMART-1.
 
✓ SELENE: Japan’s Selenological and Engineering Explorer mission, nick-
named “Kaguya” and launched in 2007, is Japan’s first major Moon mission.
It’s currently studying the Moon with many instruments, including a 
high-definition television camera that has relayed stunning images. 
SELENE is scheduled to be crashed into the Moon in 2009.

✓ Chang’e: The first major Chinese planetary spacecraft, Chang’e 
(launched in 2007) is observing the Moon’s surface geology and compo-
sition with a focus on future human exploration. The one-year mission 
has been extended to allow mapping of the lunar poles.

✓ Chandrayaan-1: The first major Indian planetary spacecraft, 
Chandrayaan-1 (launched in 2008) is studying the Moon’s topography, 
geology, and surface composition. Chandrayaan-1 launched a lunar 
impact probe, whose purpose was to take pictures of the Moon’s surface 
at increasingly high resolution, as it made its way toward a hard surface 
landing. The mission is still operational as of this writing.

On the other side of the globe, American interest in returning to the Moon grew 
following President George W. Bush’s declaration of new priorities for the U.S. 
space program in January 2004. But in order to return an American to the 
Moon, NASA officials determined some additional robotic research was worth-
while. Upcoming American Moon missions include the following:
 
✓ Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter: NASA will launch this spacecraft in 2009 
to study resources on the Moon and prepare for future human explora-
tion by observing potential landing sites.
 
 Head to lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov for updates on this mission.
 
✓ Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite: This NASA satellite 
will be launched from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2009 and will 
look for water vapor sent into orbit after part of the spacecraft impacts a 
polar crater.
 
 If this particular mission sounds interesting to you, keep up with it by 
going to lcross.arc.nasa.gov.
 
✓ Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer: To be launched in 
2011, NASA’s LADEE will orbit the Moon and study the thin lunar atmo-
sphere and the properties of Moon dust, which will affect future human 
exploration.
 
 LADEE’s mission page (nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/ladee) is 
a good resource for further info.
 
✓ Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory: Also scheduled for a 2011 
launch, NASA’s GRAIL will orbit the Moon with two satellites to map the 
lunar gravitational field in detail in order to understand the satellite’s 
subsurface structure and assist with future Moon landings.
 
 Check out moon.mit.edu for GRAIL-related updates.

304
Part V: The Future of Space Exploration 
The Russian Federal Space Agency is also planning renewed efforts in robotic 
Moon exploration. The Luna-Glob 1 mission, scheduled to launch in 2012, will 
mark Russia’s first return to the Moon since the Apollo-era Luna Program 
(see Chapter 8). The orbiting spacecraft will include four penetrators to 
study seismic signals and determine the Moon’s subsurface structure.
 
With recent precedents for international cooperation in space exploration, 
such as the International Space Station, the number of redundant missions 
being launched from different countries may seem strange. However, for new 
space-faring nations, such as India, China, and Japan, launching their own 
missions and using their own launch vehicles and mission control centers is a 
matter of national pride. Such missions can be a way to prove to themselves 
and the world that they’re ready to be taken seriously as contenders in space 
exploration. There are signs of cooperation though. For example, Russia plans 
to collaborate with both China and India on future spacecraft in the Luna-
Glob series. And NASA recently announced plans to build up the International 
Lunar Network, a group of lunar landers that will be able to work together to 
gather combined data about the Moon’s subsurface.
Looking for signs of life directly on Mars
Although many recent Mars landers (described in Chapter 20) have looked 
indirectly for signs of life on the Red Planet, by searching for the presence 
of water and studying the chemical composition of the soil, no direct experi-
ments have been done since NASA’s Viking landers searched for life in the 
1970s (see Chapter 11). Given scientists’ new understanding of the surface 
properties of Mars — and the new discoveries regarding extreme types of life 
on Earth, such as microbes that can live deep in the ocean or at extremely 
high temperatures — the time is right for a repeat mission to explicitly 
search for Martian life (and we’re not talking about little green men!). We 
describe a few important upcoming Mars missions in the following sections.
The Mars Science Laboratory
Mars exploration will take another leap forward when NASA’s upcoming Mars 
Science Laboratory (MSL) rover lands on the Red Planet’s surface. Originally 
scheduled for a 2009 launch, this car-sized rover, which is twice the size of 
and three times as heavy as Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity 
(see Chapter 20), simply wasn’t ready for prime time yet. Consequently, its 
launch was postponed until 2011. However, its expected mission duration on 
Mars (at least one year) hasn’t changed.
 
Whereas Spirit and Opportunity can perform remote chemical analysis, MSL 
will actually be able to perform onboard chemistry of both soils and ground 
rock powders, similar to the wet chemistry lab on the Phoenix Mars Lander. 
The suite of chemical-analysis instruments will specifically look for organic 
materials that could relate to life, including carbon compounds such as meth-
ane and chemical elements such as nitrogen and oxygen.

305
 Chapter 21: More in Store: Upcoming Space Missions
Another interesting instrument on MSL will be a laser capable of vaporizing a 
small portion of a rock from a distance of up to 43 feet (13 meters) and mea-
suring the chemical properties of the vaporized material to learn about the 
rock’s composition.
 
MSL will be powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), rather 
than solar panels, which will increase the lifetime of the mission as well as 
the amount of power available for instruments like the vaporizing laser. In 
addition, because MSL is too heavy to land daintily via airbags, it’ll use a new 
landing method (called the skycrane) in which the spacecraft is lowered from 
a rocket on a long tether to a soft landing. When the wheels touch the ground, 
the tether is cut, and the rocket carrier flies off to a crash landing at a safe dis-
tance. MSL’s landing will mark the first use of a skycrane.
The Astrobiology Field Laboratory
A true astrobiology mission to Mars (one that will search for not just organic 
compounds but actual evidence of past or present life on Mars) will have 
to wait until NASA’s planned Astrobiology Field Laboratory (AFL; see Figure 
21-3). This rover, currently planned for a 2016 launch, will be similar to MSL 
(described in the preceding section), but it’ll have instruments that are spe-
cifically designed to search for evidence of life on Mars.
AFL will be able to look for thousands of carbon compounds that form the basis 
of life here on Earth. Any evidence of life would probably be simple single-
celled organisms, but even the discovery of microscopic life would result in a 
huge scientific revolution. The mission will likely be directed to land either in 
an icy polar region or at a site of a former hot spring. The mission is initially 
planned to last for two years, and the spacecraft will be powered by an RTG 
(like MSL).

Part V: The Future of Space Exploration 
Planning to return a sample to Earth
Another big goal of Martian exploration is to bring a sample of Martian rocks 
to Earth. Selection of the rock samples will be key. One current suggestion for 
simplifying the selection process is to have a precursor mission choose inter-
esting rocks along its path and either mark them or carry them to a specified 
location so that the sample return mission can bring a variety of well-selected 
samples back to Earth. Of course, planetary protection concerns will be in 
full swing whenever a sample from Mars is finally brought to Earth (after all, 
no one wants dangerous Martian germs or viruses infecting the Earth), but 
scientists will also be eagerly anticipating the myriad scientific advances that 
will be in store. NASA is thinking about launching a sample return mission in 
2018 or later, perhaps as a joint mission with ESA, but detailed planning has 
yet to occur.
Sending the best to the outer planets
 
As a follow-up to the success of NASA’s Galileo mission and the joint NASA-
ESA Cassini-Huygens mission, NASA and ESA are currently planning a series of 
Outer Planet Flagship Missions. The first such mission will be a return to the 
Jovian system (Jupiter and its moons); a later mission will revisit Saturn and its 
satellites. The Europa Jupiter System Mission will launch in 2020 and arrive at 
Jupiter in 2026, with an anticipated mission duration of at least three years.
Verifying Europa’s ocean
Following the demise of the Galileo spacecraft (see Chapter 17), NASA has 
been planning a follow-up mission to help confirm the presence of a liquid 
water ocean under the surface of Jupiter’s moon Europa. If such an ocean 
exists relatively near the moon’s surface, Europa becomes a prime target in 
the search for life in outer space. (The rest of the system, including Jupiter 
and its other moons, is also an interesting target for further exploration.)
The current mission design for a trip to Europa is called the Europa Jupiter 
System Mission, and it actually includes two separate spacecraft. First, a 
dedicated NASA-built spacecraft, currently called Jupiter Europa, would 
make multiple passes through the Jupiter system before entering orbit 
around Europa. The Europa orbit phase is essential to make detailed maps 
of Europa’s surface and obtain precise gravitational and magnetic field mea-
surements that can be used to help determine Europa’s subsurface structure. 
The spacecraft will also likely bring a radar instrument to sound beneath the 
satellite’s surface in order to directly detect the ocean layer.
 
The Europa Jupiter System Mission will also include an ESA-built space-
craft that will orbit Ganymede, another of Jupiter’s moons. Additionally, the 
Russian Federal Space Agency is considering building a Europa lander.

307
 Chapter 21: More in Store: Upcoming Space Missions
Although an orbital mission at Europa will certainly be intriguing, it will also 
be relatively short-lived. Jupiter’s strong magnetic field means that the radia-
tion environment at Europa is extremely harsh, and a mission in Europa’s 
orbit will likely only be able to survive for a few months at most.
Imaging Titan’s surface
NASA’s Cassini spacecraft is currently studying Saturn and its moons, in 
particular the large moon Titan and the active moon Enceladus (you can 
read more about Cassini in Chapter 17). A follow-up mission named the Titan 
Saturn System Mission will be the second joint NASA-ESA Outer Planets 
Flagship Mission, after the Europa Jupiter System Mission. The Titan mission 
will again involve two spacecraft, one built by each agency. The NASA-built 
contribution will begin by orbiting Saturn. The mission will then enter into 
orbit around Titan, equipped with a suite of instruments specially optimized 
to see through the moon’s clouds in order to map and image its surface.
The radiation environment in the Saturn system is much more benign than 
the Jupiter system, allowing the spacecraft to survive in Titan’s orbit for 
much longer — at least a year and a half after its two years in Saturn orbit. In 
addition, Titan’s thick atmosphere makes landing easy: A lander can simply 
use a parachute to slow down instead of requiring the tricky retrorockets 
needed to land on airless worlds such as the Moon or Europa.
 
The Titan Saturn System Mission is currently planned to include a Titan lander 
built by ESA. This lander will be a traditional lander and/or a Titan balloon 
that could navigate through Titan’s thick atmosphere to view many different 
regions of the surface (flip to the color section for an image of the balloon 
concept).
Keeping an Eye Open for 
Other Exciting Missions
In addition to the new missions planned to the Moon, Mars, and beyond 
(which we describe earlier in this chapter), other missions are either already 
in place or in the works to other solar system targets. These missions will 
study asteroids, search for extrasolar planets, and examine the two extremes 
of the solar system: Mercury and Pluto. In keeping with the increasingly inter-
national nature of space exploration, many of these missions will be operated 
by countries other than the United States.

Part V: The Future of Space Exploration 
Hayabusa looks at an asteroid
Most people probably hope that an asteroid never lands in their backyards, 
but that doesn’t dissuade scientists from wanting the opportunity to study 
one up close. The Hayabusa mission, conducted by the Japanese Aerospace 
Exploration Agency (JAXA), involves a robotic spacecraft designed to bring 
a sample from near-Earth asteroid 25143 Itokawa back home to Earth. The 
spacecraft, also called Hayabusa, launched in 2003 and transmitted extensive 
data about the size, shape, topography, and other features of the asteroid.
The mission plan called for Hayabusa to actually touch the asteroid’s surface 
with a sampling device. It appears that the spacecraft did land successfully 
on the asteroid and gathered samples for about 30 minutes, but no one 
knows whether the sampling procedure was performed correctly. Japanese 
scientists think that some dust from the asteroid’s surface made it into the 
collection device, so they told the spacecraft to seal the receptacle and then 
sent the spacecraft on a return trajectory to Earth. Hayabusa also carried 
a tiny “hopper” lander called MINERVA that would’ve been able to use the 
asteroid’s extremely low gravity to bounce around, but MINERVA was acci-
dentally deployed at too high an altitude and drifted away from the asteroid 
instead of landing on it.
The spacecraft, along with its sample-return capsule, is currently on its way 
back to Earth, with an arrival date of mid-2010. After the capsule has safely 
landed on Earth, scientists will be able to find out whether it managed to 
return the first-ever sample from an asteroid.

www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/muses_c/index_e.html. For additional 
perspective on the mission’s contribution to near-Earth asteroid research,

MESSENGER revisits Mercury
In 1973, Mariner 10 gave scientists a glimpse at one side of Mercury; they had 
to wait more than 30 years until the MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space 
ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) mission launched to see the other 
half of the planet closest to the Sun. MESSENGER was launched in 2004 with 
a plan of doing several Mercury flybys and eventually entering the planet’s 
orbit. The end goal of this mission is to completely map Mercury’s surface. 
As an added bonus, if MESSENGER is successful, it’ll be the first mission to 
orbit Mercury.

309
 Chapter 21: More in Store: Upcoming Space Missions
Because of the gravity-assisted trajectories required to make it to Mercury, 
MESSENGER first did an Earth flyby and two Venus flybys before continuing 
along to the target planet. January 2008 marked MESSENGER’s first flyby of 
Mercury, during which it took a series of high-resolution images that show 
the other side of the planet for the first time (see Figure 21-4). The spacecraft 
is due to enter Mercury’s orbit in early 2011.

MESSENGER had to be lightweight (to counterbalance the amount of fuel 
required for the trip to Mercury), highly heat-resistant due to its proximity 
to the Sun, self-powering, communicative for data relays and remote pro-
gramming, and able to successfully maneuver into orbit. NASA addressed 
these design requirements one by one. Heat from the Sun is counteracted by 
MESSENGER’s Nextel sunshade, and solar panels provide a reusable source of 
power. Massive thrusters use the spacecraft’s fuel and oxidizer to meet pro-
pulsion needs, and electrically controlled high- and low-gain antennae send 
and receive data. A series of scientific instruments, including a high-resolution 
camera, a laser altimeter, and instruments to study fields and particles, will 
characterize Mercury and its space environment.

New Horizons encounters Pluto
NASA’s New Horizons mission was launched in 2006 to keep with the U.S. 
space program’s theme of exploring the heavenly bodies about which little 
is known. It’s the first mission sent to Pluto and its three moons: Charon, 
Hydra, and Nix.
 
The New Horizons mission was designed and launched back when Pluto was 
still considered a planet. (If the fact that Pluto is no longer called a planet is 
news to you, flip to Chapter 2.) Even though Pluto has since been reclassified 
as a dwarf planet, the mission’s goals remain valid:
 
✓ To study Pluto’s geology and atmosphere via high-resolution imaging
 
✓ To better understand the chemical makeup of the surfaces of Pluto and 
its moons
 
✓ To look for new discoveries such as additional moons or rings
The New Horizons spacecraft itself is triangular in shape and stocked full of 
scientific instruments (including cameras and a dust counter) that will pro-
vide significant new information about Pluto and its environment. Because 
Pluto is so far from the Sun, the spacecraft relies on radioactive energy 
rather than solar power to keep it functioning.
After being launched directly on a path that will take it to Pluto and beyond, 
New Horizons passed by the orbit of Mars and flew through the asteroid belt. 
It received a gravitational assist from Jupiter in 2007 and took images of the 
planet and its satellites during a relatively close flyby. The spacecraft is cur-
rently well on its way toward its Pluto flyby in 2015, after which it will con-
tinue on to the Kuiper Belt to fly past one or more Kuiper Belt Objects on its 
way out of the solar system.

Kepler tries to find Earth-like planets
Planet detection is one of the most important ways in which society’s 
knowledge of the universe is expanded. Locating extrasolar terrestrial plan-
ets (Earth-sized planets that orbit other stars) is of particular interest to 
scientists looking for signs of liquid water and life. NASA’s Kepler spacecraft 
is geared toward precisely this type of exploration and will study the Milky 
Way Galaxy looking for Earth-like planets. The launch of Kepler took place 
in March 2009, and the mission is expected to last at least three-and-a-half 
years.

 Chapter 21: More in Store: Upcoming Space Missions
 
The spacecraft will use a photometer (a detector very sensitive to changes 
in light levels) to monitor the sky for changes in star brightness. A change in 
brightness could indicate the passing of a planet in front of its star due to its 
orbit, and the amount of dimming of the star can be used to calculate the size 
of the planet.

MAVEN plans to study the upper 
atmosphere of Mars
Among the many missions in the works for the Red Planet is MAVEN, sched-
uled for launch in 2013. MAVEN (which stands for Mars Atmosphere and 
Volatile Evolution) was selected from a field of 11 missions proposed by 
NASA scientists. It’ll study the upper atmosphere of Mars, with a primary 
focus on how the atmosphere interacts with the Sun and how much atmo-
spheric material is lost over time. The spacecraft will arrive at Mars in 2014 
and then enter orbit around the Red Planet for a mission that’s expected to 
last at least two years.

In the habitable zone
The habitable zone is the distance from a star at 
which water could exist in liquid form on a plan-
et’s surface. Scientists place great importance 
on the habitable zone because it’s an indicator 
of that planet’s potential for life.
If a planet is too close to its star, the surface 
would be too hot for liquid water to be stable. 
On the other hand, if the planet is too far away, 
the planet would be too cold to support liquid 
water. The habitable zone is a range in which 
life-supporting planets could exist. In our solar 
system, Earth is the only planet currently in the 
habitable zone — Venus is a bit too close to the 
Sun, whereas Mars is a bit too far out from it. 
Finding an Earth-sized extrasolar planet in the 
habitable zone of its star would greatly increase 
that planet’s chances of supporting life.

BepiColumbo heads to Mercury
Mercury has historically been a difficult planet to study because of its close 
distance to the Sun. That fact has left scientists with many unanswered 
questions about Mercury for quite some time, but thanks to the European 
Space Agency’s (ESA) BepiColombo mission, those questions may soon 
be answered. Scheduled for launch in 2013, the BepiColombo mission 
will last for at least a year and perhaps much longer. It’ll consist of two 
orbiting spacecraft: ESA’s Mercury Planetary Orbiter and Japan’s Mercury 
Magnetospheric Orbiter. A range of instruments will help provide critical 
information, such as data about Mercury’s magnetic field, environment, 
and composition, that may help better describe the origins and evolution of 
Mercury. This data will complement the observations currently being made 
by MESSENGER (described earlier in this chapter).

A few other notable space missions
In addition to the missions described in the previous sections, a variety of 
other space missions are also looming on the horizon:
 
✓ Phobos-Grunt: This Russian mission, planned to launch in 2009, will 
study Phobos, a moon of Mars, and return a sample of it to Earth.
 
✓ Yinghuo-1: Set to launch in 2009 on the same rocket as Phobos-Grunt, 
this Chinese mission will orbit Mars and study its space environment.
 
✓ MetNet: This mission planned by Finland will launch between 2009 and 
2011. It’ll establish a network of small landers on Mars to study the Red 
Planet’s atmosphere and climate.
 
✓ Hayabusa 2: This Japanese mission, planned to launch between 2011 
and 2012, will be a follow-up mission to Hayabusa (described earlier 
in this chapter). It’ll target another asteroid and attempt to deploy the 
MINERVA lander a second time.
 
✓ Juno: Set to launch in 2011, this American mission will embark on a 
polar orbit of Jupiter to study the planet’s composition, magnetic field, 
and formation.
 
✓ Aditya: This Indian mission, planned to launch in 2012, will study the 
Sun’s corona.

lthough space travel started out as a venture operated by huge national 
space agencies (namely, those of the United States and the Soviet 
Union), modern innovation is beginning to open up access to space, as you 
discover in this chapter. For example,
 
✓ NASA and the Russian Federal Space Agency have new company in 
space in the form of the Chinese Shenzhou program, which sent the first 
Chinese taikonaut into space in 2003.
 
✓ Russia has flown space tourists on its Soyuz trips to the International 
Space Station. At $20 million per trip, the cash-strapped Russian Federal 
Space Agency used these flights as a crucial source of funding.

a nonprofit foundation for the first private suborbital flight.
The Emergence of China 
as a Space Power
NASA and the Russian Federal Space Agency may be two of the biggest 
names in the history of space exploration, but they aren’t the only game in 
town. Many other nations have space agencies; some, such as China, Japan, 
India, and Europe, have launched satellites into orbit and even sent robotic 
spacecraft to explore the solar system. Until recently, however, other coun-
tries had to partner with either the Russian or the American space program 
in order to get their astronauts into space. But in the last few years, China’s 
space program, run by the China National Space Administration, has emerged 
as a third major player in the world of international space exploration — and 
one with keen eyes toward the future.

314
Part V: The Future of Space Exploration 
The next couple sections get you up to speed on the history of China’s space 
program and where it’s headed.
The history of Chinese spaceflight
The Chinese have a long-standing interest in rocketry and flight, beginning 
with their use of rockets in warfare in the 12th century CE. Their space pro-
gram originally had a military bent when it was formed in the early 1950s 
as an initiative of the People’s Republic of China. Naturally, the program’s 
early emphasis was on missiles and warheads. However, interest began turn-
ing toward space exploration and satellites as the 1960s drew to a close. 
The Space Race between the Soviet Union and the U.S. was likely a factor 
in China’s interest, although at that point China wasn’t technologically 
advanced enough to attempt to join in.
The 1970s saw the development of China’s first astronaut program, and a 
series of rocket launch tests followed (though human spaceflight was put on 
hold). China successfully launched a recoverable satellite in the 1970s and 
made steady progress in the development of launch vehicles in the ensuing 
years. As China matured into a technological and economic power on the 
world stage, a human space exploration program became an important mile-
stone with both engineering and political implications.
 
China’s serious push to join the “astronaut club” began in the early 1990s with 
the development of the Shenzhou program, China’s foray into manned space-
flight, and the formation of the China National Space Administration. Although 
China had been working to put a human in space starting in the 1960s, it 
wasn’t until 2003 that the country achieved its goal. Following a series of 
unmanned test missions, the Shenzhou 5 mission carried Yang Liwei into orbit 
around the Earth, making China just the third country to put a person into 
orbit. China launched Shenzhou 6 two years later, on October 12, 2005, and 
Flight Commander Fei Junlong and Flight Engineer Jie Haisheng spent almost 
five days in space, making 75 orbits of the Earth and testing out the orbital 
module of their spacecraft.
 
Due to cooperative agreements between Russia and China in the 1990s, 
the Shenzhou spacecraft are very similar to Soyuz spacecraft (described in 
Chapter 7). However, the former are larger than Soyuz and feature a number of 
completely redesigned key systems. The Shenzhou spacecraft are based on a 
three-part design, and they contain an orbital module that provides space for 
living, working, and conducting experiments. (Unlike Soyuz, the orbital module 
can actually fly on its own apart from the rest of the spacecraft.) Shenzhou 
spacecraft also have a reentry capsule with space for the crew to return to 
Earth and a service module that contains power supplies, life-support, solar 
panels, and other items essential to manned spaceflight. The reentry capsule is 
the only part of the Shenzhou spacecraft designed to reenter the Earth’s atmo-
sphere intact and make a ground landing in Mongolia via parachutes.

315
 Chapter 22: Increasing Access to Space
The third Shenzhou flight, Shenzhou 7, took place on September 25, 2008, 
when three taikonauts (the Chinese term for astronauts) were launched into 
space. Commander Zhai Zhigang performed China’s first spacewalk, testing 
out a new Chinese-designed spacesuit while crew member Liu Boming, wear-
ing a Russian spacesuit, stayed nearby in the airlock in case of any problems.
Future plans for Chinese space exploration
China plans to continue developing its space program, following a similar 
plan to that taken during NASA’s Project Apollo (although without the politi-
cal impetus of the Space Race, the Chinese timetable is much slower). The 
next step is for China to launch an orbiting laboratory to practice docking 
two spacecraft in orbit, leading up to the creation and launch of a small 
Chinese space station. Because the Shenzhou spacecraft are based on Soyuz 
designs, they’re compatible with docking facilities on the International Space 
Station (ISS), but as of this writing, no plans have been discussed to allow 
them to dock at the ISS.
Chinese officials have stated that they also have plans to send people to the 
Moon. Although such plans are in the future and their timetables are subject 
to change, one published plan calls for a robotic spacecraft to orbit the Moon 
(Chang’e is currently in orbit; see Chapter 21 for details), followed by a lunar 
lander and a sample-return mission. In this plan, development of a human 
lunar mission would begin around 2017, with taikonauts landing on the Moon 
sometime after that.
 
The success of the Shenzhou program has shown that China is a force to be 
reckoned with in the arena of space exploration. In fact, the possibility of the 
Chinese reaching the Moon has spurred NASA officials to take the prospect 
of NASA astronauts returning to the Moon more seriously. (Hey, sometimes a 
little competition is good to spur technological development!)
An Asian Space Race?
China may not be the only Asian country plan-
ning on challenging the American and Russian 
domination of space. In 2009, India, following 
its successful robotic Chandrayaan-1 Moon 
mission (described in Chapter 21), announced 
plans to launch its own astronauts into space 
as soon as 2014. Russia will serve as a partner 
in this plan, which is thought by many to be a 
response to China’s budding space program. 
And India’s not alone in wanting “in” on the 
space club — Iran has also announced plans 
to launch astronauts into space by 2021.

Part V: The Future of Space Exploration 
A Brief History of Space Tourism
When you think of tourism, do images of Hawaiian luaus or European tours 
come to mind? Well, now you can add outer space to the list! Space tour-
ism, or the possibility of nonastronauts voyaging to the limits of Earth’s 
atmosphere and beyond, is a relatively recent phenomenon. It has hefty 
technological, social, and financial implications — some more beneficial than 
others. Space travel by nonastronauts can occur in several different ways. 
Journeying aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule is the way to go today, but other 
methods are likely to become available in the future.
Check out the following sections to see how space tourism came to be, from 
the first space tourists to the technology developments that will soon give 
birth to commercial spaceflight.
The first space tourists
The earliest space tourists owe a debt of thanks to the cash-strapped Russian 
space program. Although it met with international controversy at the time, 
the Russian Federal Space Agency decided in 2001 to allow wealthy indi-
viduals to purchase seats on the Soyuz flights it operated to and from the 
International Space Station (ISS) in order to raise some extra dough to keep 
the Russian space program flying through tough economic times.
 
Legally, Russia’s decision was on questionable ground. Russia was an inter-
national partner in the ISS, but as the sole operator of the Soyuz flights (the 
only way other than the Space Shuttle to reach the ISS), lawyers eventually 
determined that Russia had the legal right to bring paying passengers along. To 
soothe fellow ISS partners anxious about the prospect of tourists, the Russians 
restricted their tourists to Russian-built ISS modules. (The tourists could only 
visit modules built by other countries if an escort from that nation was pres-
ent.) NASA made additional legal requests of the Russians: Space tourists had to 
acknowledge that they were responsible for repair costs if they broke anything 
during their trip. They also had to agree that NASA was free of any liability if 
they were injured or worse while in space. Despite these caveats, and the huge 
price tag, a sizable group of interested candidates appeared almost immediately.
 
The first official space tourist was Dennis Tito, a former NASA rocket scien-
tist who made millions post–NASA as an investment fund manager. Tito paid 
$20 million to the Russian Federal Space Agency for his flight and trained for 
months outside of Moscow alongside the two cosmonauts who were to accom-
pany him on the flight. Both Tito and the cosmonauts were turned away from 
NASA’s Johnson Space Center when they arrived there for further training 
on NASA’s space station modules. (NASA’s administrator at the time, Daniel 
Goldin, reportedly spoke out strongly against Tito’s flight, formally expressing 
NASA’s mixed feelings on the subject.)

317
 Chapter 22: Increasing Access to Space
Of course, NASA’s opposition to Tito’s flight didn’t really matter. Tito went 
up into space in 2001 and spent close to eight days there during his flight to 
and from the ISS. He conducted a number of his own scientific experiments 
on the space station, in addition to having responsibilities assisting the 
Russian cosmonauts.
As a private citizen purchasing a ticket for spaceflight, Tito was followed 
by Mark Shuttleworth (South Africa) in 2002, Gregory Olsen (U.S.) in 2005, 
Anousheh Ansarai (Iran) in 2006, Charles Simonyi (Hungary) in 2007, and 
Richard Garriot (U.S.) in 2008.
Russia has recently announced that 2009 will be the last year for such flights 
because the permanent ISS crew will increase from three people to six. Lack 
of space on the ISS for tourists, coupled with increased demand for Soyuz 
flights when the Space Shuttle is retired in 2010, mean that Charles Simonyi’s 
scheduled 2009 repeat Soyuz trip is planned to be the last of the Russian 
space tourist program. Space Adventures, the U.S. company that has orga-
nized these commercial Soyuz trips, is reportedly attempting to charter an 
entire Soyuz flight as a final adventure.
Recent innovations in commercial 
spaceflight
One of the main thorns in the side of the space tourism industry is that ven-
turing into space is, at this point, only possible for people of extreme wealth. 
Perhaps as a way of reducing the cost of commercial space travel, organiza-
tions are planning the development of commercial space vehicles that could 
transport more people at a time (and, presumably, lower the per-person cost 
of space travel in the process).
 
The first step in developing a commercial spaceflight industry is the creation 
of a commercial suborbital vehicle. Such a vehicle would bring passengers 
to the edge of space, where they could experience weightlessness but not 
actually go into orbit — the equivalent of Alan Shepard’s first flight in 1961 
(see Chapter 7). To encourage development of the commercial spaceflight 
industry, the Ansari X Prize was established in 1996. The winner of the prize, 
SpaceShipOne, is serving as a model for future commercial space vehicles.
Racing to win the Ansari X Prize
A little healthy competition, and a significant payday, can be good incentives 
toward achieving greatness. The Ansari X Prize, a competition to develop a 
manned, reusable spacecraft without the use of government funds, provided 
an abundance of both. It offered a $10 million prize to the first private team 
to develop a spacecraft that could fly to a height of 62 miles (100 kilometers) 
and be launched into space twice in two weeks (meaning the spacecraft had 
to be largely reusable and couldn’t burn up or disintegrate for a grand finale). 

318
Part V: The Future of Space Exploration 
The overall goal? To increase the development of space technology in the 
private sector.
 
The Ansari X Prize was originally called the X Prize; it was renamed as the 
Ansari X Prize in 2004 after a sizable donation from the Ansari family. The 
prize was initiated by the X Prize Foundation, a nonprofit institute whose 
goal is to promote public competitions in areas that provide the greatest and 
longest-term benefits to the human race. X Prizes have been offered in areas 
of spaceflight, ultra-efficient automobiles, and lunar landings. Funding comes 
from different sources (for example, the Google Lunar X Prize is paid for by, 
you guessed it, Google).
Competition for the $10 million prize was steep, with 26 teams participating. 
Although some teams were large and possessed substantial financial backing, 
others were smaller and had more-limited resources. Ultimately, the com-
petition was won by Tier One, a Northrop Grumman subsidiary that devel-
oped a spacecraft and launcher designed by aerospace engineer Burt Rutan. 
Microsoft’s Paul Allen contributed substantially (more than twice the amount 
of the prize money, in fact) to the Tier One team’s efforts.
The winning spacecraft, called SpaceShipOne (see Figure 22-1), was rocket-
propelled and capable of carrying three people to a height of at least 62 miles 
(100 kilometers). Its cabin was appropriately pressurized, and a nearby truck 
performed Mission Control duties. The spacecraft was carried aloft aboard 
a carrier airplane; then it ignited its rocket engine for a trip to the edge 
of space. SpaceShipOne then glided to the ground, landing like the Space 
Shuttle.

 Chapter 22: Increasing Access to Space
SpaceShipOne made a number of suborbital flights, including two back-to-back 
flights on September 29 and October 4, 2004, qualifying it to win the Ansari X 
Prize. The first flight was piloted by Mike Melvill; the second was piloted by 
Brian Binnie. Both flights carried an extra payload (cargo) of 400 pounds (180 
kilograms) to simulate the presence of two passengers. The spacecraft was 
retired after winning the competition; it now hangs in the Smithsonian Air and 
Space Museum as the first privately funded manned spacecraft.
Developing models for future commercial space travel
Because SpaceShipOne could carry just three passengers at maximum, it was 
really built as a demonstration of the potential for privately funded space-
flight rather than an actual model for future commercial flights. However, 
much of the technology used in SpaceShipOne may make its way into a new 
spacecraft, called SpaceShipTwo, also to be designed by Burt Rutan. This 
project is being funded by Virgin Galactic, a space-faring offshoot of the com-
pany that also operates Virgin Airlines.
Virgin Galactic plans to begin offering commercial suborbital flights as early 
as 2010. These flights will take paying passengers to the edge of space, which 
is usually officially marked as an altitude of 62 miles (100 kilometers), where 
they’ll experience weightlessness for about six minutes before returning to 
Earth. Each flight will be able to carry eight people (specifically two pilots 
and six passengers).
 
The first 100 seats on Virgin Galactic’s initial flights were priced at a hefty 
$200,000 apiece, but the company reports that more than 200 seats have 
already been reserved. The price is scheduled to drop to $20,000 per seat 
after the first 500 seats have been reserved — still a pricy excursion, but much 
more within the reach of the average person who isn’t a millionaire!
Following is the quick scoop on some other companies developing commer-
cial spaceflight endeavors:
 
✓ Rocketplane: This company plans to begin suborbital flights in its 
spacecraft in 2010, provided all tests go well. Visit www.rocketplane.
com for more details.
 
✓ Rocket Racing and Armadillo Aerospace: These two groups are plan-
ning to develop a suborbital spacecraft. Seats would sell for under 
$100,000 beginning in 2010.
 
✓ Space Adventures: The company that organized Soyuz flights to the ISS 
is also planning suborbital flights beginning in 2011 from spaceports in 
the United Arab Emirates and Singapore. Interested? Check out www.
spaceadventures.com.
 
✓ Xcor Aerospace: This company is currently selling seats on its two-
person ship for $95,000 apiece. Flights will go to a height of 38 miles 
(61 kilometers) and are planned to start in 2010. For more info, head to

Part V: The Future of Space Exploration 
The Requirements and Realities of 
Current (And Future) Space Tourism
Commercial space travel is in its infancy, and despite high interest, it’s still 
fairly primitive, risky, and costly. Oh yeah, and it requires specialized train-
ing, much like conditions during the early days of air travel. However, with 
continued technological development and financial investment, commercial 
space travel may become a more comfortable luxury excursion — and even-
tually a cheap transportation method for the masses (similar to today’s air-
planes). The following sections show you what it takes to be a space tourist 
today and what the space tourism industry will look like down the road.
The necessary criteria for “regular 
people” to travel to space
Since the dawn of the Space Age, the only way to get into space was to be an 
astronaut. That’s not an easy profession for most folks to enter given that the 
requirements for becoming an astronaut are many, the selection process is 
rigorous and competitive, and years of training are required before you can 
even qualify for a space mission. However, with new options for space travel 
now available (as described earlier in this chapter), “regular people” too can 
experience the thrill of weightlessness and see Earth from high above the 
atmosphere.
To plan a trip into space as a private citizen, you have to go through a broker 
such as Space Adventures to negotiate and plan out your trip. But that’s not 
all. You also need to
 
✓ Have a great deal of money: Space travel isn’t cheap. If you want to 
go into space without being an official astronaut, it helps to be a mil-
lionaire. Flights to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard a Soyuz 
spacecraft currently cost between $20 and $30 million, which places 
them squarely out of range for the vast majority of people interested in 
space travel. As commercial space travel becomes more popular and 
more common, costs are expected to drop substantially (under $100,000 
or so for brief flights on a suborbital spacecraft). The odds are good, 
however, that space travel will remain considerably more expensive 
than other forms of transportation for some time to come.
 
✓ Meet specific physical criteria: Spacecraft are designed to hold people 
of certain heights and weights, therefore all astronauts — including 
the recreational ones — must be able to meet these specific physical 
criteria. On the health end of things, all space travelers must undergo 
rigorous screening to ensure their fitness can withstand the rigors of 
space travel.

321
 Chapter 22: Increasing Access to Space
 
✓ Be able to handle stress: Between the cramped quarters, space-hygiene 
systems, and microgravity, traveling in space is a stressful experience. 
Having a high tolerance for stress is a requirement for anyone consider-
ing the voyage.
 
✓ Complete specialized training: Space tourists must undergo a subset 
of the same training as astronauts in order to make sure they’re quali-
fied and able to do what’s required of them in space. On Soyuz flights 
to the ISS, for example, space tourists occupy a valuable seat in the 
space capsule and need to be able to fulfill certain duties. Consequently, 
they’re trained on how to perform the tasks assigned to them, how to 
move about and function in the ISS, how to use appropriate spacecraft 
controls, and how to maneuver inside the space capsule. They’re also 
given a basic course in Russian so they can better communicate with the 
other people aboard the spacecraft. For a less-advanced trip, such as 
one on a suborbital flight, the required training will be shorter, but it’ll 
likely involve at least a weekend of training and preparation (as well as 
medical clearance).
Space tourists currently don’t need to have pilot credentials or any of the 
specialized abilities that professional astronauts do. As with astronauts, 
there’s no fixed upper limit on astronaut age, though young children (or very 
small adults) would be prohibited from traveling under current guidelines.
 
All recreational astronauts need to realize that they’re taking a risk beyond 
that of the spacecraft maintaining its integrity on takeoff and landing. 
Exposure to radiation while in space is high, and other medical issues can 
result from extended exposure to microgravity. Therefore, traveling in space, 
although incredibly exciting, isn’t something to be taken lightly.
What to expect from the future 
of space tourism
Say you’re all signed up for a space excursion in the near future. What should 
you expect? First off, don’t think heading into orbit means you’re embarking 
on a luxury vacation with all the amenities of a cruise ship. On the contrary, 
space capsules and the ISS were designed for efficiency and specific scientific 
goals, not necessarily human comfort. For example: The toilet, bathing, and 
kitchen facilities on the ISS aren’t quite what you’re used to. Because gravity 
doesn’t exist in space, expect the toilet to have a vacuumlike attachment to 
help everything get where it should be going. You can also expect to have 
some trouble getting wet (and then getting dry again!) in a shower with float-
ing drops of water. Although astronauts can put up with facilities that are 
usable but perhaps not comfortable or familiar, tourists will expect more of 
the comforts of home, requiring commercial space hotels of the future to 
develop innovative new solutions.

322
Part V: The Future of Space Exploration 
That’s right: space hotels. As commercial space travel becomes more and 
more viable, it’s not crazy to imagine that space hotels will one day be devel-
oped to support human visitors. Unlike the ISS, commercial space property 
will be designed with a new purpose in mind: that of ensuring the safety, well-
being, and physical comfort of its occupants. For example, the ISS is designed 
as a research station, filled with scientific equipment. A space hotel, on the 
other hand, would be expected to have big windows and observation equip-
ment to take advantage of the breathtaking views of the Earth below. Instead 
of mundane fitness equipment meant solely to keep the ISS astronauts strong, 
a space hotel might have fitness classes in microgravity gymnastics and float-
ing ballet. And rather than the small berths on the ISS and sleeping options 
that include attaching your sleeping bag to the wall with Velcro, a space hotel 
would probably be able to develop innovative guest rooms with incredibly 
fluffy beds on the ceiling!

Chapter 23
Why Continue to Explore Space?
In This Chapter
▶ Quenching society’s thirst for answers
▶ Looking ahead to the end, when space travel will be a necessity
▶ Realizing how you benefit from space science
Justifying space exploration can be difficult from a purely rational point of 
view. With all the problems that abound on Earth, from financial woes to 
disease to protecting the environment, what possible justification can there 
be for keeping our eyes on the stars rather than the ground beneath our feet? 
In this chapter, we present several reasons for continuing space exploration, 
including the satisfaction of human curiosity, the possibility of needing space 
travel to save the human race, and the ways in which space research has 
benefitted (and will continue to benefit) the general public.
Satisfying an Innate Curiosity 
about Space
Perhaps the single most compelling reason for space exploration is simple 
human curiosity. Living beings are curious by nature. When you think about 
it, curiosity is a truly fundamental emotion; it spurs people to investigate 
and explore, learn and accomplish, observe and act. Without curiosity, you 
wouldn’t just be boring — you wouldn’t feel a need to create or do much of 
anything!
 
Curiosity is particularly important to scientists and astronomers, who tend 
to be compulsive about understanding that which can’t be seen, heard, 
smelled, tasted, or touched. The child who looks up at the night sky in wonder 
becomes the astronaut of tomorrow, and she didn’t choose this profession 
because it was the only job she could get. Space exploration is fueled by curi-
osity about the universe, and that curiosity is fundamental to society’s con-
tinued investment in space science. The urge to push forward and explore the 
unknown is an insatiable aspect of human character, one that propels space 
scientists in their quest for knowledge.

Part V: The Future of Space Exploration 
When asked in 1924 why he wanted to climb Mount Everest, British climber 
George Mallory replied simply, “Because it is there.” He disappeared a few 
months later on his way to the top, but the allure of Mount Everest remained 
until it was finally climbed more than 25 years later. Similarly, space explora-
tion remains the next great adventure — space is there, so why not go see it?
The following sections illustrate just what makes space so curiosity-inspiring.
Investigating the true “final frontier”
Humanity has always had a penchant for extending its borders past the 
edges of the known frontier — a character trait that gives human curiosity its 
sometimes nationalistic tone. Just consider the mid-19th century to see what 
we mean. American politics at the time focused on the idea that the United 
States had a duty — make that a national obligation — to expand its borders 
from the eastern seaboard to the west coast of the continent. This idea was 
embodied under the concept of Manifest Destiny, and although it was never 
an official government policy, the power of Manifest Destiny and the allure of 
the frontier drove the American population inexorably westward. From the 
first intrepid explorers to the settlers who staked out homesteads on the vast 
prairies or pushed onward to reach the western coast, the western frontier 
became a symbol of the nation’s promise.
Fast-forward a few generations and you can see some iffy parallels with modern 
space exploration. Although no one’s saying the U.S. should seek to discover 
and dominate the rest of the universe, there is, perhaps, a connection to that 
19th-century spirit of exploration and the allure of the frontier. If space truly 
is the final frontier, then we’re still in the days of Lewis and Clark — the initial 
exploration of the vast unknown. The actual familiarization of that unknown, 
and perhaps the future colonization of the solar system, is still generations off.
 
Some scholars argue that humanity, as a species, needs a frontier — that with-
out a physical place to look ahead to, to explore, and to eventually expand 
into, humanity will stagnate and turn inward instead of continuing to evolve 
and strive onward and upward. Although today some may suggest that cyber-
space takes the place of that physical frontier, the idea of one day living exclu-
sively in cyberspace is questionable. Space, on the other hand, is a physical 
location that can be visited — a location that may one day be mankind’s new 
home. Even if your generation never takes up residence in the heavens, the 
simple idea that they’re there for the visiting opens up worlds of possibility.
Looking “there” for answers “here”
The poet T.S. Eliot wrote: “We shall not cease from exploration. And the end 
of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for 
the first time.” A case for exploring and attempting to understand the solar 

325
 Chapter 23: Why Continue to Explore Space?
system and galaxy, and humanity’s place in it, is that doing so helps us 
understand our own planet.
Just as learning a foreign language can often illuminate grammar rules and 
other fundamental underpinnings of your native tongue, seeing your own 
planet from an outside perspective can also be rewarding. The Earth is 
no longer an isolated planet but rather a member of a larger solar system. 
Scientists can compare the history and development of Earth to what hap-
pened on Venus and Mars, discovering previously unknown aspects of 
Earth’s past and clues about its future.
 
Scientists can also study other solar systems. Over the last ten years, space 
exploration has revealed planets around other stars, as well as how they differ 
from our own solar system. More than 300 other solar systems have been 
discovered to date; scientists can use the details of these systems’ formations 
and structures to better understand the forces that shaped this solar system.
The Future Necessity of Space Travel
In addition to pure curiosity and the exploration of the frontier, more down-
to-Earth reasons exist for the continued exploration of space. For example, 
population pressure or a worldwide disaster of either human or natural 
origin may eventually propel humanity into the vast reaches of space. 
Additionally, the Sun will reach the end of its lifetime some billions of years in 
the future, and future humans will need to escape to a different solar system 
to ensure the survival of the species.
Presenting the real deal with 
population overflow
Earth and its natural resources are finite in size — there’s only so much land, 
water, food, and air to go around. The human population, however, keeps 
growing, and even with industrialized countries attempting to cut consump-
tion, the billions of people in up-and-coming countries such as China and 
India will continue to significantly increase demand on commodities that will 
grow ever scarcer.
Attempts to control population growth have met with limited success, 
partially because the bulk of population increases comes from developing 
countries where access to resources such as fertility control (not to mention 
prevailing religious or cultural attitudes) present barriers. Policies such as 
China’s one-child edict have received outrage from a human rights perspec-
tive, but they can still be acknowledged as an effective way to slow popula-
tion growth.

326
Part V: The Future of Space Exploration 
How many people are considered to be too many? Overpopulation is based 
not on any particular number of individuals but on the ability of their host 
(in this case, Earth) to meet the needs of those individuals. Complicating 
matters is the fact that in many countries, birth rates continue to increase 
while death rates decrease due to better healthcare, nutrition, and sanitation. 
Practically, this means that the Earth has more people to sustain (and prob-
ably will for the foreseeable future).
The real price of attempting to sustain a population for which the Earth isn’t 
equipped will potentially be paid in many different ways, such as
 
✓ Climate change
 
✓ Food shortages
 
✓ Increased cost of available resources
 
✓ More human diseases due to crowded living conditions
 
✓ Destruction of native species and habitats
 
Regardless of how life on Earth devolves, there’s little dispute that at some 
point in the future, if things continue as they are now, the Earth will no 
longer be capable of supporting future human life. When that tipping point is 
reached, population pressures may provide the impetus for a mass migration 
into space — to habitats in orbit, on the Moon, or on other planets. It’s this 
possible future that space scientists have in the back of their minds when con-
sidering the future goals of space exploration.
Looking at space as a place 
for escaping disaster
Concern is growing that a worldwide disaster may change space exploration 
from a nice-to-have intellectual exercise into a full-blown requirement for 
preserving human life. Stephen Hawking, the well-known astrophysicist, gave 
a speech in 2006 in which he mentioned that the possibility of nuclear war, 
an extreme collision of an asteroid with Earth, or a similar event could force 
space exploration into the driver’s seat of a new frontier.
In the wake of some cataclysmic event that would render the Earth’s surface 
uninhabitable, several options exist for humanity’s survival. Subterranean 
settlements and underwater cities are viable possibilities in some parts of 
the world, but they’d require substantial research and development in order 
to be made feasible. Colonization of a potentially hospitable place, such as 
Mars or the Moon, would also require significantly more research into space 

327
 Chapter 23: Why Continue to Explore Space?
exploration than is currently planned. However, colonization just may offer 
the best hope for placement and growth because such a colony could expand 
to one day include a whole new world as a new home base for humanity.
Considering the future of the solar system
 
Even if humans manage not to blow up the Earth or each other, this planet 
(and the entire solar system) still has a finite lifetime. Although the Sun cur-
rently provides enough heat and light to sustain life on Earth, keep in mind 
that it actually loses 8.8 billion pounds (4 billion kilograms) of mass every 
second as it converts hydrogen into helium fuel. The Sun is large enough, of 
course, that it can sustain this rate of mass loss for a long time, but in about 5 
billion years, the Sun will run out of hydrogen.
Examining the drive for new transportation
In order to reach distant worlds, scientists must 
come up with a way to traverse the enormous 
distances between planets in a relatively quick 
manner. At society’s current levels of technol-
ogy, a trip to the Moon takes days and a trip 
to Mars takes months. Even if more-efficient 
propulsion technologies are developed in the 
future that allow people to travel the solar 
system with ease, actually leaving the solar 
system is a whole different problem.
The distances between the stars are vast — in 
fact, such distances are measured in light-years, 
where one light-year is the distance that light 
travels in one year. A fundamental law of phys-
ics states that the speed of light in a vacuum is 
a fixed constant, meaning light always travels at 
the same speed. Another law of physics states 
that nothing can travel faster than the speed of 
light. So as far as we know, traveling that fast is 
a physical impossibility in our universe.
Of course, modern ships can’t come anywhere 
near the speed of light, so bumping up against 
this cosmic speed limit anytime soon is unre-
alistic. However, even if at some point in the 
future engineers manage to construct a space-
craft that can travel at some sizable fraction of 
the speed of light, such a ship would still take 
years to travel to the nearest star system, Alpha 
Centauri, which is 4.3 light-years away.
Science fiction has a number of ways around 
this inconvenient scientific truth, from transport-
ers to warp speed to wormholes. Perhaps the 
most mundane of these innovations is also the 
most technologically likely: generation ships, 
or sleeper ships. Acknowledging the reality of 
travel times that are measured in decades or 
centuries, colony ships of the future could carry 
a manifest of passengers in suspended anima-
tion, with the ship itself run by a small crew 
or even fully automated. Or such a ship could 
simply carry families whose children’s children 
may one day reach their final destination.
Such ideas are still obviously beyond society’s 
current technological capabilities, but they don’t 
require fundamental revolutions in the laws of 
physics to become reality. A voyage of this type 
would necessarily be one-way, requiring pas-
sengers to leave behind everyone and every-
thing they know. These space pioneers will be 
like past generations who gave up everything to 
walk for miles as part of a wagon train to settle 
the West.

328
Part V: The Future of Space Exploration 
Running out of gas in your car is an inconvenience, but running out of fuel for 
the Sun is guaranteed to be cataclysmic. Even before the Sun is completely 
out of fuel, perhaps in just a billion years or so, the mass loss from the Sun 
will cause its temperature to increase, a step that’s required in order for the 
Sun to maintain a constant pressure in its core. This temperature increase 
will translate into increased solar radiation on Earth, resulting in a heating 
of the surface that could cause a runaway greenhouse effect like that found 
on Venus. Surface temperatures on Earth will become uncomfortably warm 
as solar radiation is trapped by thickening clouds. Eventually the oceans will 
evaporate, and the Earth will become extremely inhospitable.
Assuming that humans somehow manage to survive this phase, the next 
phase in solar evolution will be even worse. When the Sun runs out of hydro-
gen fuel, it’ll switch to burning helium in its core. Before this switch can take 
place, the outer layers of the Sun will expand hugely while its core contracts. 
This is called the red giant phase because the Sun will cool as it expands, 
changing its color to red (a lower-energy wavelength). This change will spell 
the end for the inner solar system — the red giant Sun will spread so large 
that first Mercury and Venus, and then probably Earth, will be engulfed. 
(Figure 23-1 shows the Sun’s red giant phase.)
 
Figure 23-1: 
The red 
giant phase

The Sun increases to 10,000   
luminosity, cools to 4,000 K, and 
expands to 200 radii, engulfing 
Mercury, Venus, and perhaps 
even Earth.
2. After hydrogen fuel 
is exhausted, the 
core heats to 108 K, 
and the short helium- 
burning phase 
begins.
1. It loses a lot of 
mass because of 
the weak gravity at 
the edge.
3. The outer shell may 
be unstable, showing 
contractions and 
variability.
4. After the helium burns, 
there isn’t enough mass to 
start carbon fusion, so the 
collapse toward the white 
dwarf stage begins.

 Chapter 23: Why Continue to Explore Space?
Although the inner solar system will become uninhabitable during this phase, 
the outer solar system may undergo a brief period of habitability. When the 
Sun’s intensity increases roughly 1 billion years from now, Jupiter’s moon 
Europa and Saturn’s moon Titan may become a refuge for the remnants of 
humanity escaping a sweltering Earth. Such environments will only be tran-
sient, however, because the Sun’s energy output will decrease when it enters 
the red giant phase. Eventually, the Sun will use up all of its fuel sources and 
burn out, ejecting its outer layers into a bright planetary nebula while the 
center collapses into a tiny white dwarf star.
 
Given the finite nature of the solar system itself, space exploration is becom-
ing even more of a necessity for the long-term survival of humanity. Sure, 
colonization of the galaxy may sound like science fiction, but real scientific 
reasons exist to push for expansion beyond Earth — and even beyond this 
solar system. If, a billion years from now, humans are still confined to this 
solar system, then the extinction of the human race is a distinct possibility.
Space Lends a Hand to the Common Man
Unlike most other fields of study, space science manages to evoke a childlike 
sense of wonder while also providing practical applications that can make life 
better for much of the general public. Granted, the end goals of space explo-
ration may be lofty, but the mechanics of getting into space require down-
to-earth innovations in everything from rocket mechanics and solar cells to 
water-filtration systems.
 
Astronomers, astronauts, and aeronautical engineers seek to explore space 
not just for their own personal edification but also for the benefits space 
exploration brings to the larger experience and understanding of society. 
Spinoffs of space science have improved just about every aspect of human-
ity’s existence, and what scientists find out from space exploration has greatly 
informed mankind’s ability to live and work here on Earth.
Applying space technology 
to everyday life on Earth
Some of science’s best and brightest minds are focused on the tools, space-
craft, and equipment required for space missions. Fortunately, many of 
the resulting space innovations and inventions have a direct applicability 
to everyday life. For example, did you know that the CCD (Charge Coupled 
Device) chips responsible for detecting breast tumors were initially devel-
oped for the Hubble Space Telescope? How about the fact that NASA engi-
neers contributed to the development of the Speedo racing swimsuits worn 
by most gold-medal Olympic swimmers? Or that the DHA (docosahexaenoic 

330
Part V: The Future of Space Exploration 
acid, an omega-3 fatty acid) and ARA (arachidonic acid, an omega 6-fatty 
acid) found in most infant formulas today (and a range of other foods) are a 
direct result of NASA’s research into astronaut life-support?
Part of the allure of basic space research is that it can produce innovative 
results that are initially wholly unexpected. Many other types of devices and 
advances owe their origins to the space program — some of which you may 
not expect! You can dive into the details of them in Chapter 26.
Finding new sources of natural 
resources in space
Although space will eventually be a destination for human habitation, in the 
nearer term it just may be a source of raw materials for humans on Earth to 
use. Commercial development of space may soon become a reality, especially 
if it can be made profitable. From the mundane to the exotic, many materials 
in space may be used either to help support space exploration or be brought 
back to Earth. Here are a couple examples:
 
✓ Many asteroids are composed primarily of valuable metals such as iron 
and nickel. A small asteroid could provide enough metal to meet the 
worldwide demand for several years if that iron and nickel could be 
mined out and brought back to Earth. A number of commercial compa-
nies are seriously investigating plans for asteroid mining, particularly of 
near-Earth asteroids that are in accessible orbits.
 
✓ Another component common in the solar system is water. Water ice is 
found in many comets and asteroids. It probably wouldn’t make financial 
sense to bring water from space back to Earth, but such water would be 
a precious resource to supply the crews of mining operations, space sta-
tions, and spaceships. Water can also be broken down to provide hydro-
gen fuel for rockets.
After a viable commercial plan is developed, private companies will likely go 
far beyond the space-tourism model to push the envelope in space explora-
tion. Wide-eyed curiosity has always gone hand-in-hand with profiteering, 
and space exploration may get a boost far beyond what can be done solely 
by government-sponsored expeditions if (or perhaps when) a new Space 
Age–style gold rush begins.

W
ater. Certain biogenic elements (ones that are essential for living 
organisms), such as carbon and nitrogen. An energy source. What do 
all three have in common? They’re the requirements for life as we know it. 
The Earth is currently the only place in the solar system known to meet all 
three requirements. Consequently, it’s the only place that we know of where 
life currently exists. Of all the other places in the universe that could support 
current life, or could’ve supported life at some point in the past, some are 
more likely hosts than others. Read this chapter to explore ten places to look 
for life beyond Earth (in order of their distance from Earth). Some may seem 
likely to you, such as Mars and Jupiter’s moon Europa; others may seem less 
likely but not unthinkable, such as comets and extrasolar planets (those plan-
ets found outside of our solar system).
Venus: (Potential) Life in the Clouds
Surface temperatures on Venus measure around 800 to 900 degrees Fahrenheit 
(427 to 482 degrees Celsius), and the atmosphere is heavy and acidic. Venus 
is about 30 percent closer to the Sun than the Earth, but that’s not the only 
reason that modern Venus is a very hot place. The high surface temperature 
comes primarily from the thick atmosphere, which insulates the surface 
instead of allowing the Sun’s heat to escape back to space. All of these charac-
teristics make for rather inhospitable conditions for most forms of life.
However, the surface isn’t the only place to look for life on Venus. Some 
terrestrial bacteria and other microbes are able to survive in very harsh 

334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
environments, and scientists speculate that the dense clouds surrounding 
Venus may be able to harbor these types of life-forms. Both temperature and 
pressure are lower in the high-atmosphere clouds, and droplets of water could 
exist at some levels, perhaps providing a stable environment for organisms 
escaping the harsh surface conditions.
 
Four billion years ago, when the Sun was a lot cooler and the Earth was likely 
a ball of ice, Venus may have been the right temperature to support a wider 
variety of life-forms. After all, carbon and water are essential elements for life 
as we know it, and Venus has an abundance of carbon dioxide in its atmo-
sphere. Some theories actually suggest that the planet’s surface may have 
been covered with liquid oceans in cooler times. Those oceans likely evapo-
rated as the planet grew hotter and hotter. The European Space Agency’s 
Venus Express mission is currently gathering data that may help fill in the 
gaps of scientists’ current Venus knowledge; flip to Chapter 16 for details.
Mars: Once a Warm and Wet Planet
Mars is one of the places that’s most likely to have sustained life, because 
it has one of the greatest abundances of life-supporting materials. Thanks 
to measurements taken by the Phoenix Mars Lander (which we describe in 
Chapter 20), scientists know for sure that the Red Planet currently has water 
in the form of water ice, which is frozen in ice caps at its North and South 
Poles. In addition, planetary geologists have studied images of the Martian 
surface and seen features that were once carved by flowing water (much like 
river channels on Earth). This fact means that Mars was once much warmer 
and wetter than it is today.
 
During this warm and wet period, about 4 billion years ago, the conditions on 
Mars would’ve been a lot like those on Earth today. Scientists think there’s a 
good possibility life could’ve formed on the Red Planet at this time. Although 
life on Mars could’ve been possible way back then, it’s much less likely to be 
able to survive there today — the surface of Mars is too cold, and the atmo-
sphere is too thin, for liquid water to be stable aboveground. Perhaps a 
future space mission will find signs of fossilized Martian organisms, but 
current life would be a huge surprise.
Europa: An Ocean beneath the Surface
Jupiter’s moon Europa is about the same size as Earth’s Moon, but its surface is 
covered with a bright layer of water ice crisscrossed by cracks and fractures. 
Scientists think this surface ice layer may be hiding an ocean that contains 
more water than all of Earth’s oceans combined. Water is one of the three 
requirements for life as we know it, so the likely presence of liquid water 
makes Europa a prime candidate for life.

335
 Chapter 24: Ten Places to Look for Life beyond Earth
In addition to liquid water, Europa also likely contains the right mix of chemi-
cal elements (think carbon and nitrogen) to support life. If sufficient energy 
is available, such as from hydrothermal systems at the bottom of the ocean, 
then life could very well exist on Europa right now, making it one of the prime 
solar system targets in the search for life beyond Earth. A future mission to 
Europa may well explore an active ecosystem beneath its icy surface.
Ganymede: An Ocean Buried 
between Layers of Ice
Magnetic field measurements strongly suggest a layer of liquid water deep 
inside Ganymede, the largest of Jupiter’s moons. This layer, which is buried 
more deeply than Europa’s liquid water layer, is likely sandwiched between 
two layers of ice. The top layer is believed to be regular water ice, whereas 
the bottom layer is thought to be a special form of high-pressure ice.
Water that’s on top of a layer of rock, like in Europa’s ocean, can circulate 
through the rock and dissolve interesting kinds of chemicals that can react 
with each other in the rock. Ganymede’s ocean, however, just has another ice 
layer to circulate through underneath it. Consequently, the kinds of chemicals 
the water can pick up are limited. So although Ganymede’s ocean is still a pos-
sible place for life, the water itself has less potential for chemical reactions and 
energy sources that could help support an ecosystem.
Callisto: An Even Deeper Layer of Water
Surprisingly, even Callisto, a more distant moon of Jupiter, could have a 
liquid water layer like Europa and Ganymede (covered earlier in this chapter). 
Callisto’s old, battered surface looks much more like the Moon than an active 
world like Europa. However, magnetic field results suggest that a liquid water 
layer could exist below Callisto’s surface ice layer.
As is the case for Ganymede, this water layer is deeply buried and likely also 
located between two ice layers rather than on top of a rock layer. In fact, 
scientists aren’t even sure that Callisto’s rock is concentrated in the center 
of the satellite — bits of rock and dust could be scattered throughout the 
surface ice, making Callisto a much more primitive body than Europa and 
Ganymede. Again, although a water layer makes life a possibility, the extreme 
depth of such a layer reduces possible energy sources and communication 
with the surface. Chemical reactions are also reduced by the water layer 
being on top of ice rather than rock.

336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Titan: Swimming in Methane
Titan, the largest of Saturn’s moons, has an extremely thick atmosphere that 
makes liquid hydrocarbons such as ethane and methane possible on its surface. 
Organic compounds such as nitrogen are present in abundance as well. In 
fact, nitrogen makes up the majority of Titan’s atmosphere.
Speaking of Titan’s atmosphere, scientists believe that it’s similar to the atmo-
sphere surrounding Earth when life first formed there roughly 3.5 billion years 
ago. Note, though, that Earth is a warm planet. Titan has a surface temperature 
of about –290 degrees Fahrenheit (–180 degrees Celsius), meaning any water 
present on the surface would be in the form of ice. The cold temperature alone 
isn’t a good sign in the search for life, but Titan’s surface is covered with fea-
tures carved by running liquid (in this case, methane), and the Cassini space-
craft has even found methane lakes and signs of rain (check out Chapter 17 for 
the scoop on Cassini).
The continued presence of methane in Titan’s atmosphere suggests that 
something else may be generating it. On Earth, methane is produced by 
life, and some scientists have suggested that Titan’s methane could also be 
related to some sort of biological process.
 
Interestingly, methane is an unstable component of Titan’s atmosphere — it 
quickly decays in sunlight, producing nitrogen compounds that fall out onto 
the surface.
Enceladus: Tiny but Active
Enceladus, a tiny moon of Saturn, was known to be anomalously bright and 
suspiciously smooth according to images captured by the Voyager 1 space-
craft in 1981 (see Chapter 11 for details on the Voyager missions). Cassini 
images from 2005 revealed a stunning explanation for Enceladus’s appear-
ance in the form of giant plumes of material jetting off the satellite’s South 
Pole. Water vapor, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide have all been detected in the 
plume, and liquid water is likely present just beneath the surface. Methane 
and other organic molecules are also possibilities.
Liquid water always raises the chances for life, and the geysers of Enceladus 
are a dramatic example of how that water can reach the surface. One unan-
swered question, however, is how stable the liquid water environment is — 
the rate at which Enceladus is currently ejecting material isn’t sustainable 
over the long term. A future mission, the Titan Saturn System Mission, will 
return to Titan and Enceladus, although this mission is still in the early plan-
ning stages (check out Chapter 21 for more info).

337
 Chapter 24: Ten Places to Look for Life beyond Earth
Triton: Venting Plumes of Nitrogen
Triton, a large moon of Neptune, is an icy body very far from the Sun. Its sur-
face is covered primarily with nitrogen ice, but frozen carbon dioxide and 
water ice are also present. Triton has a young surface, and plumes of nitrogen 
have been observed being vented off the surface, making Triton one of just a 
few satellites in the solar system known to be currently geologically active (the 
others are Jupiter’s Io, Saturn’s Enceladus, and perhaps Saturn’s Titan).
 
Triton orbits Neptune in a retrograde orbit, meaning it moves backward from 
the other satellites in the system. This and other factors suggest that Triton 
formed elsewhere in the solar system, such as in the Kuiper Belt, and was cap-
tured by Neptune. The capture event could’ve contributed enough heat to 
melt Triton’s interior thoroughly, which in turn could help support Triton’s 
current activity.
Like Jupiter’s Europa, the upper layer of Triton’s subsurface is composed 
primarily of water ice on top of rock. Also like Europa, evidence shows there 
may even be sufficient heat to keep the base of the ice layer melted, creating 
a deep subsurface ocean that has the benefit of lying on top of a rocky foun-
dation, thereby making life a possibility.
Comets: Filled with Life’s 
Building Blocks
Comets, leftover ice balls from the early days of the formation of the solar 
system, hold the building blocks of life because they’re composed primarily of 
water ice, with bits of dark, carbon-containing organic dust mixed in. Comets 
could’ve been very important to the formation of life on Earth. One theory sug-
gests that much of Earth’s water actually came from comet impacts early in the 
solar system’s history. Other theories suggest that comets could’ve carried the 
seeds of life to Earth, where it thrived. How can such a thing be possible? Well, 
scientists know, for example, that meteorites can actually exchange material 
between Earth and other planets —pieces from the Moon and even from Mars 
have been found on the Earth. It’s even possible that microbes could survive 
the trip from Mars to Earth, or vice versa.
 
But can comets actually hold life? Because they’re primarily small, primitive 
bodies, it’s unlikely that they possess enough of an energy source to actually 
drive the chemical reactions needed to form life. However, one possibility is 
that the interiors of comets may hold small amounts of liquid water, perhaps 
just individual droplets around grains of ice and other materials. This tiny 
amount of water could nevertheless be sufficient to carry life from one place to 

338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
another, allowing comets to transport prebiotic materials (simple compounds 
that may be used in the formation of life), or perhaps even simple life-forms, 
throughout the solar system.
Extrasolar Planets: Life 
around Other Suns
The search for planets that orbit other stars has heated up in the last ten 
years, with hundreds of planets now known to circle other suns. Scientists 
have yet to find planets similar in size to Earth, however. All known extrasolar 
planets are large bodies the size of Jupiter or Saturn, or larger. Future missions 
(such as Kepler, covered in Chapter 21) will be able to find Earth-sized planets. 
If such planets exist in the habitable zone, the distance around a star at which 
liquid water would be stable on the surface of a planet, then the possibilities 
for life become much greater. But how can humans detect life on another 
planet if actually traveling there isn’t possible?
 
One option for detecting life on far-away worlds is to look at the color of the 
planets and study the gases present in their atmospheres and on their sur-
faces. Plants convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen 
through photosynthesis; oxygen, combined with methane, is unstable unless 
continually supplied through some chemical reaction. Thus, the discovery of 
an oxygen- or nitrogen-containing atmosphere on an extrasolar planet would 
send up an immediate red flare to scientists looking for life.
Another way to search for life is to look for the telltale color of chlorophyll, 
which makes plants on Earth appear green. This pigment takes sunlight and 
uses it to produce energy and fuel, but the process is somewhat imperfect 
because green plants can’t absorb 100 percent of the available sunlight. 
Scientists have speculated that plant life on extrasolar planets, if it exists, 
may be black rather than green. Black vegetation would be a more-perfect 
absorber of solar energy because all light would be absorbed — but even 
that would depend on the spectrum of light given off by the planet’s star.
If an Earth-sized planet is ever discovered in the habitable zone of a far-off 
star, then scientists will regard it as a prime possibility for the existence of 
life. However, even huge Jupiter-sized planets may have inhabitable moons, 
extending the definition of the habitable zone far outside what’s currently 
considered a limiting factor for life. Although receiving an actual signal from 
an intelligent civilization would be the best, and most exciting, confirmation 
of life beyond Earth, scientists will continue to look for simpler forms of life 
on extrasolar planets as technology improves to allow for direct imaging of 
these worlds.

Ten Ways Space Travel Isn’t 
Like Television or the Movies
In This Chapter
▶ Limiting the speed and realm of space travel
▶ Knowing how space affects humans
▶ Debunking ideas about aliens
A
lthough science fiction movies and TV shows shape people’s ideas 
of how space exploration should look and work, reality, like with so 
much on the big (or small) screen, is often a completely different story. From 
humanoids with funny noses to whooshing spaceships, many science fiction 
films and shows make basic errors in biology and physics. Whether these 
errors exist for the sake of plot convenience or aesthetics, they’re errors 
nonetheless. This chapter sets the record straight on ten of those mistakes.
A Cosmic Speed Limit Exists
 
The phrase “Move to light speed and beyond!” sounds great when you’re in a 
hurry, but the reality is that anything with mass is constrained to the speed of 
light. Einstein’s theory of special relativity is largely to blame. Einstein first began 
with the observation that the speed of light in a vacuum is always constant. By 
combining that idea with the concept that the laws of physics are the same for 
all observers, he showed that things get really weird as you approach the 
speed of light: Time stretches out, lengths get shorter, and really the only thing 
that remains the same is the speed of light! Because of these weird effects, it’s 
theoretically possible to travel at speeds that approach the speed of light, but 
it’s scientifically impossible to go any faster.

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
If Einstein’s theories continue to be borne out in the future (and so far they’ve 
passed every test), then it would be possible for a spaceship to travel, say, 
at 99.99 percent of the speed of light (186,000 miles, or 300 million meters, 
per second), although that would require huge amounts of energy. Traveling 
any faster, however, would fall square into the realm of science fiction, not 
science fact.
Various movies and television shows have relied on things like warp speed 
and hyperdrive to refer to faster-than-light space travel. Because distances in 
the galaxy are vast, it’d still take more than four years to reach the nearest 
star system when traveling at the speed of light — a fact that makes for not-
so-entertaining entertainment! Unless scientists of the future come up with a 
way to change the laws of physics, it’s unlikely that the future of space cruisers
and starships warping between stars in a matter of hours or days will ever 
become reality.
Wormholes Aren’t On Call
Can a stable wormhole be used as a quick way to travel between two distant 
locations? Well, in the 1997 movie Event Horizon, a spaceship with the ability 
to create wormholes flew into one and resurfaced years later with a supernatural 
visitor. A stable wormhole also featured prominently in the TV series Star 
Trek: Deep Space Nine as an instant portal between two far-away parts of 
the galaxy. If it’s on the big screen or the boob tube, it must be true, right? 
Wrong, scientifically speaking.
Wormholes are hypothetical ways of circumventing the normal laws of space
and time; they’re an unproven phenomenon that can’t be summoned on 
demand. Also, although general relativity does provide for the possibility of 
wormholes connecting universes, scientists think they’d consist of a tunnel-
like boundary. In the movies and on television, wormholes can lead anywhere 
at any time. Furthermore, what scientists know about wormholes suggest 
that they’re incredibly tiny and exist only for a very brief amount of time — 
less than a second — suggesting that sending anything as large as a space-
ship through one for an extended period of time is sheer folly (but, we admit, 
great entertainment).
Space Isn’t Noisy
From Star Wars to the arcade down the street, most popular portrayals of 
space depict it as a very noisy place. Between the whooshing of starships and 
the sounds of laser guns shooting audibly (directly into space, mind you), 
space appears about as quiet as a New York City street during rush hour. 

341
 Chapter 25: Ten Ways Space Travel Isn’t Like Television or the Movies
Explosions are fiery, loud events, and one spaceship crashing into another 
results in audible, audience-pleasing sounds.
 
The fundamental problem with space noise is that sound waves don’t transmit 
in a vacuum. A vacuum is defined as matter-free space, or space with a gaseous 
pressure significantly lower than its atmospheric pressure. The parts of outer 
space that lie between planets and stars (in other words, most of it) are consid-
ered a vacuum. Sound waves are mechanical vibrations that require a molecular 
substance, such as water or air, to travel through. Vacuums are devoid of those 
molecules, so there’s no way sound can transmit through them.
The classic 1968 movie 2001: A Space Odyssey got this one right. During the 
scenes in which an astronaut travels outside his ship in a spacesuit, all you 
can hear is his breathing. Unfortunately for scientific accuracy, audiences 
find silence boring. They much prefer special effects, so expect on-screen 
spaceships to continue whooshing by.
Asteroids Aren’t Packed Together
Many movies, from the Star Wars saga on, show ships flying through a tightly 
packed region of giant rocks the size of small moons, narrowly avoiding col-
lisions. Some depictions of asteroid belts have rocks moving in all directions; 
others have the rocks packed very closely together. Sure, this makes for exciting 
cinema, but it doesn’t represent reality. In our solar system, the asteroid belt 
located between Mars and Jupiter does in fact contain millions of objects. 
However, they’re spread over such a large amount of space that hitting one
without aiming precisely for it would be very difficult. In fact, if you were located 
right next to one asteroid, you likely wouldn’t even be able to see any others.
 
Similarly, the rings of material surrounding Saturn are spectacular when seen 
from a distance. Up close, you can see that they’re composed mostly of tiny 
particles of ice and dust. The rings themselves are thousands of kilometers 
wide with an average thickness of only 33 feet (10 meters)! In fact, when seen 
edge-on, the rings are so thin that they seem to disappear completely.
Humans Can’t Breathe “Air” 
on Another Planet
If films like Rocketship X-M are correct, people would be able to land on, say, 
Mars, get out, take a stroll, and (if they’re lucky enough) interact with some 
very humanlike Martians. The sad fact is that oxygen-breathing beings — like 
us or you or your favorite Fido — can’t breathe the atmosphere on Mars 
or any other planet. Humans evolved on a planet with a specific mixture of 

342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
oxygen, nitrogen, and other atmospheric gases. There’s no reason to think 
that such a mixture would be replicated elsewhere just through random chance.
In fact, it’s very unlikely that Earthlings could breathe the air on a different 
planet without some sort of mask or filter (think of the clunky spacesuits 
worn by Armstrong and Aldrin during the Apollo 11 Moon landing). Real 
space exploration just isn’t quite as fashionable (or easy!) as Star Trek, 
Stargate SG-1, and other science fiction sagas make it out to be.
You Won’t Explode in Space
The vacuum of space clearly isn’t a place where you’d want to travel unpro-
tected, but movies generally exaggerate the effects of exposure to it. For 
example, in the 2000 movie Mission to Mars, an astronaut removes the helmet 
of his spacesuit, while in space, and promptly freezes and dies instantly. 
Other movies, such as the 1981 film Outland, show a person exploding when 
exposed to the vacuum of space.
 
True, exposure to vacuum is never a good idea, but you aren’t going to die 
instantly if you find yourself in such a scenario. Both theory and actual tests 
show that you can probably survive exposure to vacuum for between 60 and 
90 seconds without lasting effects. (You’d only remain conscious for about 10 
seconds, though, so you should make sure to get to safety as soon as possible.) 
You won’t explode because your skin is strong enough to keep your body 
intact and your blood from boiling. And although you’d eventually freeze, it’d 
take hours for your body to lose all of its heat. The actual cause of death would 
be a lack of oxygen.
Our props to 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) for actually getting this one right. 
In the film, a main character must travel through space from a ship to an airlock 
for a few seconds without his helmet. He survives without too much incident. So 
did a NASA astronaut-in-training from the 1960s. His spacesuit sprung a leak, and 
he lost consciousness after 14 seconds. When the chamber was repressurized, 
he regained consciousness and was just fine.
People Float, Not Walk, in Space
On the deck of the starship Enterprise or in the bays of the Millennium Falcon, 
people walk as freely as they do on Earth. Check for yourself the next time 
you watch an episode of Star Trek or one of the original Star Wars films. We 
bet you won’t spot Captain Kirk or Han Solo floating to the top of the ceiling! 
If the actors were really on a ship in outer space, though, they most certainly 
would be. Think about astronauts on the International Space Station — they 
float around because the station is in free-fall as it orbits the Earth. All parts 

343
 Chapter 25: Ten Ways Space Travel Isn’t Like Television or the Movies
of the space station and everything in it, including the inhabitants, are falling 
at the same speed. Thus, they’re effectively in a zero gravity environment. 
Whenever space travel extends to interplanetary or interstellar space, 
travelers really will be floating in zero gravity.
 
Because long-term exposure to microgravity environments can have negative 
consequences for the strength of an astronaut’s bones, inhabitants of the 
International Space Station must exercise daily. One way to simulate gravity in 
space is by spinning a space station or spaceship. The motion results in a cen-
tripetal force that pushes the contents of the spacecraft toward the outside, 
simulating gravity. Such a spinning space station was correctly depicted in the 
1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey. However, most spacecraft you encounter on-
screen don’t spin. Some sort of artificial gravity device would therefore be 
necessary to allow the ships’ inhabitants to walk around inside.
Aliens Don’t Look Like Humans
 
The media-driven perception of alien life is completely derived from the 
human experience, which makes little sense because alien life is, well, alien. 
Human biases are likely reflected in the appearance of aliens as humanoid, 
with two arms, two legs, and a physical structure basically similar to that of 
Earthlings. In addition, dressing up a sci-fi show’s alien-of-the-week actors in 
humanoid costumes, perhaps with funny noses or green skin, is much easier 
than inventing truly unique beings. The reality is that life on other planets 
wouldn’t look human. There’s just no reason for it to.
Some shows have attempted to create beings that are completely different, 
from silicon-based, rocklike creatures to sentient energy clouds. These 
efforts acknowledge the reality that if humans ever do find life elsewhere, it 
likely won’t be at all recognizable!
Aliens Don’t Speak English
According to just about any science fiction movie or TV show that features 
intelligent alien life, extraterrestrials speak a language. Sometimes it’s English; 
sometimes it’s a similar language. The first problem with this situation in real 
life is figuring out how to understand an alien language. Without Star Trek’s 
universal translator, a Star Wars protocol droid, or even the Babel Fish from 
the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy series, such a feat would be difficult.

344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Secondly, almost all of these languages are verbal, which is a direct extrapola-
tion of mankind’s perception of what defines language. Studies of communica-
tion have shown that species such as Humpback whales and honeybees actually 
have complex languages that can communicate vast amounts of information 
very efficiently. The honeybees’ communication in particular is completely 
nonverbal. If an alien civilization ever does try to contact Earth, or if astronauts 
ever come into direct contact with one, its style of communication might be 
completely different from anything humans have ever known.
Space Invaders Aren’t Among Us
Movies such as Starman and Close Encounters of the Third Kind bring extra-
terrestrial invaders to Earth, and numerous television shows have suggested 
that UFOs are common features in Earth’s skies. However, there’s no scientific 
evidence that UFOs have visited our planet. If alien ships were really landing on 
Earth and abducting people, wouldn’t some sort of evidence exist that could 
be studied by scientists, such as traces of material not found on Earth or clear 
pictures of an alien spacecraft?
Television shows such as The X-Files are fond of portraying aliens masquerad-
ing as humans. The idea is that these nonhuman humans can take over the 
body of your friends, your teachers, or your parents. Not so, say scientists. If 
such aliens ever made it to Earth, the odds of their being able to survive our 
climate, atmosphere, and food are slim.
 
Although chameleons can change their color and some can even change their 
gender, no precedent exists in either the natural or technological world for the 
type of transformation that an alien invasion of a human body would require. 
Not a good enough reason for you? Just consider this: If so many people aren’t 
happy with their bodies half the time, why would a superior life-form want to 
be human in the first place?

Ten Types of Everyday Items 
Brought to You Courtesy of NASA
In This Chapter
▶ Improving medical procedures and technology, as well as your health
▶ Making life easier, from transport and tools to food and entertainment
E
xploring space, discovering new worlds, understanding Earth — that’s 
all well and good, but how do your space-centric tax dollars actually 
help you? If you’ve ever used a laptop without burning your lap, had a CAT 
scan, used wireless headphones, driven a car, or fed jarred food to a baby, 
chances are you’ve used NASA-created technology. In fact, going an entire 
day without running into conveniences and necessities that were spun off of 
NASA research is pretty hard to do. Read this chapter to find out about ten 
types of items brought to you by NASA.
Medical Diagnostics and Procedures
Diagnostics are one key to preventing and treating a host of medical conditions, 
and NASA technology has greatly improved this area of medicine. Here are a 
couple examples:
 
✓ CAT scan: The computer-aided tomography scan (aren’t you glad they 
shortened the name?) allows doctors to “look inside” a person without 
surgery or patient discomfort. The core functionality of this scanning 
technique came from NASA’s methods of enhancing lunar pictures taken 
during the Apollo missions (which we cover in Chapters 9 and 10).
 
✓ Ocular screening: This technology has helped hundreds of thousands 
of children see more clearly. Developed by NASA to process the images 
being sent by space probes, ocular screens reflect light into a child’s 
eyes and create an accurate image, allowing ophthalmologists to study 
and detect problems earlier than they were previously able to.
Various medical procedures have also benefitted from your friendly U.S. 
space agency. Laser angioplasty, a technique that allows doctors to unclog 

346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
arteries without doing invasive surgery, uses technology that was originally 
developed for satellites to study the atmosphere.
Need another example? LASIK vision correction allows military and laypeople 
alike the chance to achieve their dreams without being halted by vision prob-
lems or encumbered by eyeglasses. The technique, which involves reshaping 
the cornea using lasers, is based on techniques developed by NASA 
contractors for spacecraft rendezvous and docking maneuvers.
 
Interestingly enough, NASA only recently allowed astronaut candidates to undergo 
laser eye surgery to meet the eyesight requirements for astronaut qualification. 
Originally, NASA officials were concerned about how laser-corrected eyes might 
be affected by the changes in pressure and gravity that come with spaceflight.
Medical Devices
 
A wealth of medical devices owes its origins to NASA research. One of the 
most-vital medical devices to have originated in the space program is the pro-
grammable pacemaker. This mechanism, which helps regulate an irregular 
heartbeat, was created using technology that originated in the electrical com-
munication design for spacecraft.
The voice-activated wheelchair, a device that can greatly improve the quality 
of life for people who are completely paralyzed, was also developed via NASA 
technology. Research into robotics and remotely operating instruments in 
space was later used to create these wheelchairs, which can be directed to 
perform a number of motions by using single-word commands.
Recovering from an accident is no easy task, but the odds of success can 
be improved with the SAmbulation Module (SAM), a rehabilitative device for 
physical therapy patients who need to practice walking. The technology for 
SAM was developed during NASA’s robotics research and work on assembly 
of sounding rockets.
Even the cochlear implant was partially developed by a NASA engineer! This 
device allows deaf people to hear by translating sounds into digital signals 
sent to a speech processor. It was first designed by an electronics instru-
mentation engineer who had undergone a number of failed surgeries to try to 
restore his hearing.
Personal Health and Safety
A number of other spinoffs of NASA technology may seem even further afield 
from their original purposes, but that doesn’t make them any less useful. For 
example, NASA clean rooms use a special airflow technique to keep 

347
 Chapter 26: Ten Types of Everyday Items Brought to You Courtesy of NASA
contaminants off spacecraft during their assembly. The same technique has 
been used at tollbooths located on highways and bridges to keep the toll 
collectors from inhaling high levels of hazardous engine exhaust.
NASA technology has also been used to produce a small radiation detector 
that can sense harmful levels of microwave radiation. For people who work in 
hazardous areas, such a device sounds an alarm when microwave radiation 
levels become too high.
Another device, an alarm system that can be used by the elderly, prison guards, 
and others who need to send a quick message, uses ultrasonic transmitters to 
send an inaudible signal to a base station, which can indicate exactly where 
the transmitter is located. This technology was originally developed by NASA 
to determine the exact position of a spacecraft in space.
The life rafts developed for Project Apollo, which can inflate in just 12 sec-
onds and turn themselves upright automatically, have also found commercial 
applications for emergency use on airplanes and other places where a quick-
inflating raft comes in handy. Additionally, NASA technology has helped 
create lightweight air tanks for firefighters and aided in the development of a 
device that can give a 30-minute warning of an impending lightning strike.
Transportation Aids
The next time you travel from here to there, consider NASA’s role in getting 
you safely to your destination, particularly if you’re flying. The impact of space 
research on commercial airplanes has been enormous. NASA’s techniques for 
rendezvous and docking in space greatly influenced modern Air Traffic Control 
and collision-avoidance systems. Cabin pressure monitoring was developed 
from NASA spaceflight research, as were more-advanced parachute recovery 
systems, engine combustors, airplane materials, wind shear management, and 
even ways to prevent jet lag.
And by the way, if you drive a car, you should know that today’s spiffier, stur-
dier tires are Martian in origin. NASA’s development work with materials that 
could help rovers rock and roll on Mars went on to improve radial tires sold 
locally today.
Many other aspects of automotive engineering were improved with NASA 
research. Chemical sensors, high-performance lubricants, stud-free snow 
tires, more safely designed cars — all these areas, and more, emerged from 
research that went into the Space Shuttle and other space missions. Even 
rescue tools designed to help extricate injured people from crushed cars 
came from NASA instruments that were originally intended to separate con-
nected modules and other devices on the Space Shuttle.

348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Power Tools
From aerospace companies that build spacecraft to astronauts who do repairs 
in space, NASA has required special tools to perform its missions. Some of 
these tools have actually turned out to have interesting applications back 
on Earth:
 
✓ Cordless drills are ubiquitous in households today, and they can thank 
the Apollo missions for their existence. The Apollo astronauts needed a 
quick, portable way to drill into the Moon’s crust to take core samples, 
and cordless drills were the answer. Today, cordless tools abound in size, 
variety, and application; the cordless vacuum cleaner is a similar spinoff.
 
✓ A special welding torch that was originally developed to help join 
together the special materials used to construct the Space Shuttle’s fuel 
tanks is now used by commercial companies to weld sheet metal.
 
✓ Microlasers are commercially used to melt, drill, or cut materials 
extremely precisely, but this technology was originally developed by 
NASA as an alternate way to communicate with spacecraft over the 
long distances between the planets. Such communication is commonly 
done via radio waves, but laser communication systems may be used on 
upcoming spaceflights.
Computing Power
 
Laptop computers have been around since the early 1980s, but they weren’t 
always as lap friendly as they are today. NASA engineering helped keep lap-
tops from scorching their users by inventing the fans required to help keep 
them cool. Portable computers were used in many space navigation systems 
and are found throughout the world today.
Other breakthroughs in the world of computers that had their start in NASA 
research include
 
✓ A more compact and efficient three-dimensional package of semi-
conductors, which are stacked in a cube shape to allow computers to 
have faster processing speeds while also being smaller and lighter.
 
✓ Virtual reality software, which allows a user to wear a headset and seem 
to be immersed in a three-dimensional, virtual world (such software was 
used for astronaut training).
 
✓ Software for structural analysis; first used to help design spacecraft, this 
software is currently used to design cars, tools, and other complicated 
systems.

349

Foods and Nutrition
“What’s for dinner?” is a universal question, even if the questioner is orbiting 
Earth! Advances in space food keep today’s astronauts well-fed — and help 
make meals easier and healthier for those of us on the ground as well.
 
✓ Modern DHA (docosahexaenoic acid)-fortified baby foods can thank 
NASA for their presence on grocery store shelves. NASA research into 
long-term survival in space led to the isolation of two fatty acids with 
many protective properties. At first found only in breast milk, and not in 
processed infant formulas and baby food, these substances are now 
routinely added to infant formulas and meals.
 
✓ Although freeze-dried Apollo space food may have left something to be 
desired, its principles have found ready use today. Freeze-dried meals 
and snacks are shelf-stable, require little effort to reheat, and are tastier 
than their predecessors. They’re commonly used by hikers who want 
lightweight, long-lasting foods.
 
✓ The entire method of displaying refrigerated products in the grocery store 
owes thanks to NASA scientists. Work that went into the development of 
airflow and refrigeration coils found use in the display system that most 
grocers use to simultaneously show off their cold merchandise and keep 
it fresh and safe.
Intelligent Clothing
Would you believe that NASA has even contributed to clothing? An astronaut’s 
“cool suit,” which helps regulate his or her body temperature despite the 
heat and weight of a bulky spacesuit, found a quick application in patients 
with multiple sclerosis. People with this degenerative neurological disease 
have seen rapid improvement in their symptoms when wearing a version of 
the suit, which provides cooling liquid through flexible tubing.
 
Don’t forget your feet! It’s hard to imagine participating in any sport without 
shock-absorbing shoes. Yes, that’s right; NASA made those possible, too. The 
original material developed for the “Moon Boots” worn by the Apollo astronauts 
was repurposed for athletic shoes, allowing both athletes and astronauts to play 
and work harder without ruining their feet.
Advanced Fabrics and Plastics
Do you remember those ribbed swimsuits that helped the U.S. team achieve 
victory in the 2008 Olympics? They were developed using NASA techniques for 

350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
laser-closed seams and fabric that actually repels water. (And yes, we’re still 
talking about swimwear here.) They were even tested in NASA wind tunnels.
 
The flame-retardant fabric that makes up a large portion of infant and toddler 
sleepwear is also a NASA spinoff. Treating fabrics with chemicals to make 
them fire-resistant was a technique originally developed by NASA to protect 
astronauts from accidental fires, in space or on the ground. Today, such 
fabrics are standard equipment for babies and children.
Over time, other fabrics and plastics have made their way from NASA’s drawing 
board into consumer life. Check out the following:
 
✓ Racecar insulation material originated as part of the Space Shuttle’s 
thermal system.
 
✓ Rust- and scratch-resistant metal coatings were developed for the Space 
Shuttle.
 
✓ Scratch-free plastic eyeglass lenses were derived from the NASA technique 
of creating polymers that are light, strong, and resilient (and impervious 
to trampling by school children).
Entertainment Necessities
Space technology isn’t used just for health and work. Check out these enter-
tainment necessities developed directly from space technology:
 
✓ Wireless earphones and headsets, used for listening to music or conduct-
ing a conference call, are the direct result of technology developed for 
NASA that allowed the Apollo astronauts to communicate with Earth from 
the Moon.
 
✓ You can thank NASA for your eye-protecting, UV-blocking sunglasses. 
The filtering technology came from work done to protect astronauts and 
equipment from damaging solar radiation.
 
✓ Those creamy cosmetics that people apply to their skin are the result of 
lunar research. The same image processing and analysis tools that went 
into studying the Moon’s surface have been used by major cosmetics 
manufacturers to make their products more effective.
 
✓ Fore! The metallic glass alloy commonly used in golf clubs is a spinoff 
of NASA’s Space Shuttle metals research (flip to Chapters 13 and 14 for 
general Shuttle information). This strong yet flexible material has many 
potential uses in automotives, defense, sports, and other industries.
