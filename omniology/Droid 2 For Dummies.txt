About the Author
Dan Gookin has written more than 115 books about technology, many of 
them accurate. He is most famously known as the author of the original For 
Dummies book, DOS For Dummies, published in 1991. Additionally, Dan has 
achieved fame as one of the fi rst computer radio talk show hosts, the editor 
of a computer magazine, a national technology spokesman, and an occasional 
actor on the community theater stage.
Dan still considers himself a writer and technology “guru” whose job it is 
to remind everyone that our electronics are not to be taken too seriously. 
His approach is light and humorous yet very informative. He knows that 
modern gizmos can be complex and intimidating but necessary to help 
people become productive and successful. Dan mixes his vast knowledge of 
all things high-tech with a unique, dry sense of humor that keeps everyone 
informed — and awake.
Dan’s most recent books are Word 2010 For Dummies, PCs For Dummies, 
Windows 7 Edition, and Laptops For Dummies, 4th Edition. He holds a 
degree in communications/visual arts from the University of California, San 
Diego. Dan dwells in North Idaho, where he enjoys woodworking, music, 
theater, riding his bicycle, being with his boys, and fi ghting local govern-
ment corruption.

Introduction
D
on’t be fooled: Just because the Droid 2 is a smartphone doesn’t mean 
that it’s harboring some form of insidious intelligence. There’s no alien 
brain in the device. It isn’t going to take over the world, though it can intimi-
date you — that is, until you understand and accept that it’s your phone. The 
Droid 2 is a gizmo that helps make your life a heck of a lot easier.
The key to understanding an amazing piece of technology such as the Droid 2 
is understanding. To help you get there, I offer this book: your friendly, infor-
mative, relaxed, and often irreverent reference to the Motorola Droid 2 cell 
phone. Prepare to get more from your phone.
About This Book
This book is a reference. I don’t intend for you to read it from cover to cover. 
Instead, you’ll find each chapter to be its own, self-contained unit, covering a 
specific topic about using the Droid 2 phone. Each chapter is further divided 
into sections representing a task you perform with the phone or explaining 
how to get something done. Sample sections in this book include
 
✓ Typing on your Droid 2
 
✓ Phoning someone you call often
 
✓ Setting up Visual Voice Mail
 
✓ Sending a picture to Facebook
 
✓ Creating a 3G mobile hotspot
 
✓ Turning your phone into a deejay
 
✓ Dialing an international number
 
✓ Saving battery life
You have nothing to memorize, no mysterious utterances, no animal sac-
rifices, and definitely no PowerPoint presentations. Instead, every section 
explains a topic as though it’s the first thing you read in this book. Nothing 
is assumed, and everything is cross-referenced. Technical terms and topics, 
when they come up, are neatly shoved to the side, where they’re easily 
avoided. The idea here isn’t to learn anything. This book’s philosophy is to 
help you look it up, figure it out, and get back to your life.

Droid 2 For Dummies 
How to Use This Book
This book follows a few conventions for using the Droid 2. The main way you 
interact with your phone is by using its touchscreen, which is the glassy part 
of the phone as it’s facing you. Buttons also adorn the Droid 2, all of which 
are explained in Part I of this book.
You have various ways to touch the screen, which are explained and named 
in Chapter 3.
Chapter 4 discusses text input on the Droid 2, which involves using the Multi-
Touch keyboard on the screen or the sliding keyboard. The Droid 2 also fea-
tures the Swype onscreen keyboard for superfast text entry. And, when you 
tire of typing, you can always input text on your Droid 2 by dictation.
This book directs you to do things on your phone by following numbered 
steps. Each step involves a specific activity, such as touching something on 
the screen. For example:
 
3. Choose Downloads.
This step directs you to touch the text or item on the screen labeled 
Downloads. You might also be told to do this:
 
3. Touch Downloads.
 
 Some phone options can be turned off or on, as indicated by a gray box with 
a green check mark in it, as shown in the margin. By touching the box on the 
screen, you add or remove the green check mark. When the green check 
mark appears, the option is on; otherwise, it’s off.
 
 The barcodes in the margins are there to help you install recommended apps. 
To install the app, scan the barcode using special software you install on the 
Droid 2. Chapter 20 discusses how to add software to your phone, and in 
Chapter 26 I discuss how to use the Barcode Scanner app to read barcodes.
Foolish Assumptions
Even though this book is written with the gentle handholding required by 
anyone who is just starting out, or who is easily intimidated, I have made a 
few assumptions. For example, I assume that you’re a human being and not a 
robot from Venus.

 Introduction
My biggest assumption: You have a Droid 2 phone by Motorola. Though you 
can use this book generically with any Android phone, it’s specific to the 
things the Droid 2 can do.
In the United States, cellular service for the Droid 2 is provided by Verizon. 
Many things that the Droid 2 can do are based on the services Verizon offers, 
such as Visual Voice Mail or Backup Assistant.
I also assume that you have a computer, either a desktop or laptop. The 
computer can be a PC or Windows computer or a Macintosh. Oh, I suppose 
it could also be a Linux computer. In any event, I refer to your computer as 
“your computer” throughout this book. When directions are specific to a PC 
or Mac, the book says so.
Programs that run on the Droid 2 are apps, which is short for applications. A 
single program is an app.
Finally, this book doesn’t assume that you have a Google account, but 
already having one helps. Information is provided in Chapter 2 about setting 
up a Google account — an extremely important part of using the Droid 2. 
Having a Google account opens up a slew of useful features, information, and 
programs that make using your Droid 2 phone more productive.
How This Book Is Organized
This book has been sliced into six parts, each of which describes a certain 
aspect of the Droid 2 or how it’s used.
Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel
This part of the book serves as your introduction to the Droid 2. Chapters 
cover setup and orientation and familiarize you with how the phone works. 
Part I is a good place to start, plus you discover things in this part that aren’t 
obvious from just guessing how the phone works.
Part II: Phone 101
Nothing is more basic for a phone to do than make calls, which is the topic 
of the chapters in this part of the book. The Droid 2 can make calls, receive 
calls, and serve as an answering service for calls you miss. It also manages 
the names of all the people you know and even those you don’t want to know 
but have to know anyway.

Part III: Beyond Telephone Communications
The Droid 2 is about more than just telephone communications. Part III of 
this book explores other ways you can use your phone to stay in touch with 
people, the Internet, and other gizmos such as your desktop computer or a 
Bluetooth headset. Chapters in this part explain how to use text messaging, 
send and receive email, browse the Web, use social networking, and set up 
your phone for networking, among other things.
Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone
This part of the book explores the nonphone things your phone can do. For 
example, your phone can find locations on a map, give you verbal driving 
directions, take pictures, shoot videos, play music, play games, and do all 
sorts of wonderful things that no one would ever think a phone can do. The 
chapters in this part of the book get you up to speed on those activities.
Part V: Hither and Thither
The chapters in this part of the book discuss a slate of interesting topics, 
from taking the phone overseas and making international calls to customizing 
it to the necessary chores of maintenance and troubleshooting.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Finally, this book ends with the traditional For Dummies Part of Tens, where 
each chapter lists ten items or topics. For the Droid 2, the chapters include 
tips, tricks, shortcuts, and things to remember, plus a list of some of my 
favorite Droid 2 phone apps.

t’s a given that Hollywood sequels rarely live 
up to the quality of the original movies. That 
hard-and-fast rule among movie buffs ensures 
that the rare exceptions are well known: The 
Godfather II, The Empire Strikes Back, and Toy 
Story 2. Plus, a handful of others are often touted 
as being as good as or better than their originals. 
But normally, sequels suck.
That isn’t the case with the Droid 2. Unlike a typi-
cal Hollywood spinoff, the Droid 2 is a great 
improvement upon its predecessor. All the things 
you might have admired about the ﬁ rst Droid are 
there, such as its compact size and sliding key-
board. Additionally, new features have been 
added — stuff you might not recognize. So 
whether you’re an old hand or you’re new to the 
Droid 2, you’ll welcome the helpful orientation 
information found in this part of the book.

A Droid 2 of Your Own
In This Chapter
▶ Putting your phone together
▶ Charging the battery
▶ Identifying the phone’s pieces parts
▶ Taking the phone with you
▶ Keeping the phone in one place
N
o one ever asked what happened to R2D1, the lesser-known little 
brother of R2D2 from the Star Wars films. His real name was R2D. That 
was before the newer, improved R2D2 came along. Once the newer, improved 
model showed up, R2D became R2D1. He lost his luster and fame after the 
newer model showed up. That happens to all sorts of Droids all over 
the universe.
For your phone, the Droid 2 replaces the original Droid, 
which, as far as I know, is still named Droid and not 
Droid 1. Getting started with your Droid 2 begins with 
a basic familiarity of the hardware. This chapter 
helps you get to know your way around the Droid 2, 
by identifying its various parts, buttons, and sliding 
whatnot.
Initial Droid 2 Setup
Though it hasn’t happened, it would be neat if your 
phone rang inside the box just as you were opening it. 
The ringing would certainly accelerate the tedious process 
of opening the box. Then imagine how much fun it would be to 
answer the phone and hear a cheerful yet robotic voice say, “Hello from 
your new Droid 2!” Yeah, that would be fun. Reality is different, as described 
in this section.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
Looking in the box
Several items come in the Droid 2 box. Even though you’ve probably opened 
the box already and its contents are doubtless strewn across your desktop, 
I suggest that you take a moment to locate and identify each of the following 
goodies:
 
✓ Droid 2 phone
 
✓ Papers, instructions, warranty, and perhaps a booklet titled Getting 
Started or even Los Primeros Pasos
 
✓ The phone’s battery, which might already be inside the phone
 
✓ The phone’s back (battery) cover
 
✓ Charger/data cable, which is basically a USB cable
 
✓ Charger head, a wall adapter for the charger/data cable
 
The phone may ship with a clingy, static plastic cover over its screen. 
Another plastic cover may be clinging to the battery cover. The plastic thin-
gies tell you where various features are located or how to install the battery. 
You can remove the plastic at this time.
An additional sheet of plastic may be found by sliding out the Droid 2 
keyboard; flip the phone over and remove the plastic from the back of 
the touchscreen.
In addition to the items described in the preceding list, you might have been 
given a bonus package of goodies from whoever sold you the phone. If the 
outfit is classy, you have a handy little tote bag with perhaps the Verizon 
logo on it. Inside the bag, you might find these items:
 
✓ Smart-looking, leatherette belt-clip phone holster
 
✓ Micro-USB car charger
 
✓ Headphones
 
✓ Even more random pieces of paper
The most important doodad is the phone itself, which might require 
some assembly before you can use it; refer to the next section for assembly 
directions.
You can safely set aside all this stuff until you get the phone assembled. I rec-
ommend keeping the instructions and other information as long as you own 
the phone: The phone’s box makes an excellent storage place for that stuff — 
as well as anything else you don’t plan to use right away.
If anything is missing or appears to be damaged, contact the folks who sold 
you the phone.

 Chapter 1: A Droid 2 of Your Own
Installing the phone’s battery
Your phone might arrive in a disassembled state. If so, your first duty as a 
new Droid 2 owner is to install its battery. Your second duty is to charge the 
battery. Installing the battery is easy, and charging it doesn’t require a light-
ning storm and a kite.
If the nice people who sold you the phone already installed the battery, the 
phone is ready for charging; see the next section. Otherwise, you can install 
the battery yourself by following these steps:
 
1. Ensure that the phone is turned off.
 
 There’s no need to follow this step unless you got all excited and already 
turned on your phone. If so, see Chapter 2 for information on turning off 
the Droid 2.
 
2. Flip over the phone so that the front (the glassy part) is facing away 
from you.
 
 Don’t remove the phone’s cover when the phone is turned on. You 
should also disconnect any cables or the headset, if attached.
 
3. If the battery isn’t installed, you must remove the cover: Place both 
thumbs on the center part of the upper back cover.
 
 Refer to Figure 1-1 for proper thumb placement.
 
4. Gently slide the back cover downward using your thumbs.
 
 A gentle push is all that’s required; feel free to squeeze the phone as you 
push downward. The back cover slides down a wee bit, about 1⁄8-inch.
 
5. Lift the phone’s back cover and set it aside.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
 
6. If necessary, remove the battery from its plastic cocoon.
 
 You can also remove the back cover from its plastic cocoon. You can 
also peel the plastic “sticky” from the back cover at this time.
 
7. Orient the battery so that its metallic contacts are in the upper right 
corner as you’re looking at the back of the phone.
 
 The battery is shaped like a giant, square mint cookie. The battery 
doesn’t taste like mint, so please do not eat it.
 
8. Insert the battery, top edge first, and then lower the bottom edge like 
you’re closing the lid on a tiny box.
 
 Refer to Figure 1-2 for help in positioning and inserting the battery. The 
metal contacts on the battery should be on the upper right edge as you 
insert the battery into the phone, as illustrated in the figure.
 
 When it’s fully inserted, the back of the battery is flush with the back of 
the phone; it cannot stick up, not one itty bit.
 
9. Replace the phone’s back cover.
 
 The cover has four prongs that slide into four slots on the back of the 
phone. Position the cover over the slots and it falls into place. Then 
slide up the cover with your thumbs until it snaps into place.

 Chapter 1: A Droid 2 of Your Own
Charging the battery
After inserting the battery into your new phone, the next step is to charge it. 
It’s cinchy:
 
1. Connect the charger head (the plug thing) to the charger/data cable.
 
 They connect only one way.
 
2. Plug the charger head and cable into a wall socket.
 
3. Plug the phone into the charger/data cable.
 
 The charger cord plugs into the micro-USB connector, found at the 
phone’s left side. The connector plugs in only one way.
As the phone charges, the notification light on the phone’s front side may 
light up. When the light is orange-yellow, the phone is charging. When the 
light is green, the phone is fully charged.
The phone may turn on when you plug it in for a charge. That’s okay; but 
you need to read Chapter 2 to find out what to do the first time the Droid 2 
turns on. You also may need to phone your cell provider for additional setup 
instructions before you turn on the phone.
 
✓ Wait until the notification light turns green before unplugging the phone 
from its power cable, especially the first time you charge the phone.
 
✓ The notification light uses three colors: amber for charging, green for 
fully charged, and red for warning that the battery is low.
 
✓ The notification light flashes whenever the phone requires your atten-
tion, such as when new email or a text message has been received. See 
Chapter 3 for information on reviewing notifications.
 
✓ You can use the phone while it’s charging.
 
✓ The Droid 2 can use any standard cell phone charger, though I recommend 
using the equipment that came with the phone or is designed for a Droid 2.
 
✓ You can charge the Droid 2 in your car, using what was once called a “cig-
arette lighter.” Simply ensure that your car cell phone charger features a 
micro-USB connector and that it’s designed for use with the Droid 2.
 
✓ The phone also charges itself when plugged into a computer using 
either the USB cable that came with the phone or any micro-USB cable 
attached to a computer. The computer must be on for charging to work.
 
✓ The Droid 2 charges more quickly when it’s plugged into the wall as 
opposed to a computer’s USB port or a car adapter.
 
✓ A micro-USB connector is a standard USB connector, but one that fea-
tures a teensy dongle that plugs into the left side of your Droid 2 phone. 
The connector has a flat, trapezoid shape, which makes it different from 
the mini-USB connector, which is squat and slightly larger, and used pri-
marily on evil cell phones.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
Droid 2 Orientation
Back in the old days, a telephone came with a rotary dial. When you dialed a 
phone, you were literally turning a dial on the phone. When you hung up the 
phone, you placed the headset on a hook. Not so with cell phones. For exam-
ple, on the Droid 2 you use something called a touchscreen to dial the phone. 
In case you don’t know what a touchscreen is, or what many of the other goo-
bers are that festoon your phone, this section explains everything.
Knowing what’s what on your phone
Like all other confusing things, the Droid 2 attempts to intimidate you with 
some new terms for its features, not to mention that you may not be aware of 
all the hardware features available. Fret not, gentle reader.
Figure 1-3 illustrates the names of all the useful knobs and doodads on the 
front of your Droid 2 phone. Figure 1-4 illustrates the same things, but for 
your phone’s backside.

Figure 1-4: Your phone’s rump.
The terms referenced in Figures 1-3 and 1-4 are the same ones used else-
where in this book as well as in whatever scant Droid 2 documentation exists.
In addition to a front and back, your phone has a middle part, which slides 
out. This teensy keyboard was added to the Droid 2 because of a shipping 
error from Lilliput. You slide the keyboard out to the left when facing the 
phone, as illustrated in Figure 1-5.
When you’re done using the keyboard, you can slide it back into the phone, 
as shown in Figure 1-5.
 
✓ The phone’s Power button, which turns the phone off or on, is found on 
top the phone, as shown in Figures 1-3 and 1-4.
 
✓ The main part of the phone is the touchscreen display. You use the 
touchscreen with one or more of your fingers to control the phone, 
which is where it gets the name touchscreen.
 
✓ The soft buttons appear below the touchscreen, as shown in Figure 1-3. 
They have no function unless the phone is turned on.
 
✓ Yes, the main microphone is on the bottom of the phone. Even so, it 
picks up your voice loud and clear. There’s no need to hold the phone 
at an angle for the microphone to work.

✓ The phone’s volume is adjusted by using the volume buttons on the 
phone’s left side, as shown earlier in Figure 1-3.
 
✓ Sliding out the keyboard wakes up the phone when it has been sleeping. 
Refer to Chapter 2 for more information on why the phone gets tired and 
falls asleep.
 
✓ Officially, the keyboard is the sliding keyboard. Notice that it’s not a true 
QWERTY keyboard, like the one found on your computer. Chapter 4 
covers using the sliding keyboard.
 
✓ When the keyboard is out, the phone’s touchscreen display switches to 
landscape orientation. You can read more about the phone’s ability to 
orient the display into landscape and portrait modes in Chapter 3.

Listening with earphones
The Droid 2 most likely didn’t come with earphones. That’s not a reason to 
give up on the concept. In fact, the nice people who sold you the Droid 2 
might have tossed in a set of earbud-style earphones for you to use. If not, 
well then, they weren’t that nice, were they?

 Chapter 1: A Droid 2 of Your Own
You’re probably familiar with the earbud type of earphone: The buds are set 
into your ears. The sharp, pointy end of the earphones, what you don’t want 
to stick into your ear, plugs into the top of the phone.
Between the earbuds and the sharp, pointy thing is often found a doodle on 
which a button sits. The button can be used to mute the phone or to start or 
stop the playback of music when the Droid 2 is in its music-playing mode.
You can also use the doodle button to answer the phone when it rings.
There’s usually a teensy hole on the back side of the doodle that serves as 
the phone’s microphone. You can use the earphones as a hands-free headset 
with the Droid 2. Because I’m half Italian, I love this option.
 
✓ You can purchase any standard cell phone headset for use with the 
Droid 2.
 
✓ Some headsets feature extra doodle buttons. Those headsets work fine 
with the Droid 2, though the extra buttons may not do anything specifi-
cally with the Droid 2.
 
✓ The earbuds are labeled R for right and L for left. If not, the end with the 
shorter wire is placed in your right ear.
 
✓ You don’t use the earphone’s doodle to set the phone’s volume, either 
in a call or while you’re listening to music. Instead, the volume is set by 
using the volume control buttons, found on the side of the phone, as 
illustrated in Figures 1-3 and 1-4.
 
✓ See Chapter 18 for more information on using your Droid 2 as a portable 
music player.
 
✓ Be sure to fully insert the earphone connector into the phone. The 
person you’re talking with can’t hear you well when the earphones are 
plugged in only part of the way.
 
✓ You can also use a Bluetooth headset with your phone, to listen to a 
call or some music. See Chapter 14 for more information on Bluetooth 
attachments for the Droid 2.
 
✓ Fold the earphones when you don’t need them, as opposed to wrap-
ping them in a loop: Put the earbuds and connector in one hand and 
then pull the wire straight out with the other hand. Fold the wire in half, 
and then in half again. You can then put the earphones in your pocket 
or on a tabletop. By folding the wires, you avoid creating one of those 
Christmas-tree-light wire balls that would otherwise appear.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
Exploring your phone’s guts
Rarely do you need to examine the intricacies of your phone’s innards. Still, 
unlike other cell phones, the Droid 2 is designed to let you easily access 
replaceable items inside the unit without having to sneak around behind the 
manufacturer’s back and alerting the warranty police.
Specifically, you need to open your phone for only two reasons:
 
✓ To replace the battery
 
✓ To access the MicroSD memory card
When you need to access those items, you can obey these steps:
 
1. Turn off your phone.
 
 See the section “Turning off the phone,” in Chapter 2, for more 
information.
 
2. Flip the phone over.
 
3. Press down on the upper part of the back cover, using your thumbs as 
illustrated earlier, in Figure 1-1.
 
 The back cover slides down.
 
4. Set aside the back cover.
 
 Use Figure 1-6 to identify the phone’s battery and the MicroSD 
memory card.
 
 The battery is removed by lifting its bottom edge: Use your fingernail to 
lift beneath the label Battery Removal Here, as illustrated in Figure 1-6.
 
 To remove the MicroSD card, pull it downward using the tiny lip at the 
bottom of the card. It fits in there kind of tightly, so don’t be shy about 
dragging it out. Pull out the card all the way until it’s free.
 
 See Chapter 23 for more information on the Droid 2 battery.
 
 When you’re done rummaging around inside your phone, you close 
things up:
 
5. Set the back cover onto the phone; the little prongs on the back cover 
fit into four holes on either side of the phone.
 
 The cover fits only one way.
 
6. Slide the cover up until it snaps into position.
 
 To access the MicroSD card, you must first remove its battery.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
You can turn on the phone again, after the cover is locked into place. See 
Chapter 2 for information on turning on your phone.
 
The Droid 2 does not have or use a SIM card. Other cell phones use the SIM 
card to access the cellular network. The SIM, which stands for Subscriber 
Identity Module, identifies the phone and does other things you need not 
care about.
Fashionable Droid 2 Accessories
The Droid 2 has available two accessories you can buy to enhance your 
mobile communications experience. They are the Multimedia Station and the 
Car Mount phone holder.
Using the Multimedia Station
In a nutshell, the Multimedia Station is a heavy base into which you can 
set your phone. The station features a USB connection so that the phone 
can recharge inside the Multimedia Station as well as communicate with 
a computer.
When the Droid 2 is set inside the Multimedia Station, it runs a special 
Clock home screen, which displays the current time and provides access to 
common phone features, as shown in Figure 1-7.
Figure 1-7: The Droid 2 in the Multimedia Station.
The Multimedia Station makes a great home for the phone (see the next sec-
tion) and can be used as a bedside alarm or as a great way to access the 
phone when it’s deskbound.

 Chapter 1: A Droid 2 of Your Own
 
✓ The Multimedia Station can be purchased at the same place where 
you obtained your Droid 2 or at any location where cell phone goodies 
are sold.
 
✓ With the Multimedia Station, you get the handsome, high-tech-looking 
base and a USB cable, plus a power adapter.
 
✓ See Chapter 19 for more information about using your state-of-the-art 
cell phone as a digital clock.
 
✓ Chapter 18 covers playing music on the Droid 2.
 
✓ Playing slide shows and managing pictures with the Droid 2 are covered 
in Chapter 17.
Watching Your Droid 2 in Your Car
There’s no point in fumbling with your phone while you’re on the road. 
That’s because the Droid 2 comes with a handy car mount. When the car 
mount is properly assembled, a suction cup on one end of it lets you stick 
your Droid 2 to any flat surface. Because it’s a car mount, I assume that you’ll 
suck it to the windshield or dashboard of your favorite auto and not your 
refrigerator or an elevator door.
When you stick the Droid 2 into the car mount, the phone automatically 
switches to the Car Home screen, shown in Figure 1-8. You can read more 
about the Car Home screen in Chapter 3, which is your basic Droid 2 orienta-
tion chapter.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
The Droid 2 also has a rapid car charger, which may come with the car 
mount or may be an extra purchase. The rapid car charger is one of those 
gizmos that plugs into the car’s power adapter (née cigarette lighter). 
The other end of the rapid car charger plugs into the Droid 2, which can be 
nestled in the car mount or just rattling loose inside your vehicle.
 
✓ Yes, you can use the rapid car charger without having to use the 
car mount.
 
✓ To make the suction cup on the car mount work properly, you use a 
hard, smooth surface. An adhesive plastic disk comes with the car 
mount. Use the disk to ensure that the suction cup has something solid 
to suck on.
A Home for Your Phone
There was no point in finding a home for your phone back when the 
Telephone Company bolted the thing to the wall. I remember hunting all 
over the house for our family’s first cordless phone. That was a pain when 
the batteries were dead and the phone’s locator-ring trick didn’t work. It 
was even more of a pain when you just knew that the phone was lost in the 
sofa cushions and Aunt Martha was pulling some zzz’s on the couch.
Your Droid 2 lives an untethered existence, so find it a permanent spot — 
even when you’re carrying it around.
Carrying the Droid 2
The compact design of the Droid 2 is perfect for a pocket or even the teensi-
est of party purses. It’s well designed so that you can carry your phone in 
your pocket or handbag without the fear that something will accidentally 
turn it on, dial Sri Lanka, and run up a heck of a cell phone bill.
Because the Droid 2 features a proximity sensor, you can even keep the 
phone in your pocket while you’re on a call. The proximity sensor disables 
the touchscreen, which ensures that nothing accidentally gets touched when 
you don’t want it to be touched.
 
✓ Though it’s okay to place the phone somewhere when you’re making a 
call, be careful not to touch the phone’s Power button (see Figure 1-3). 
Doing so may temporarily enable the touchscreen, which can hang up a 
call, mute the phone, or do any of a number of undesirable things.

 Chapter 1: A Droid 2 of Your Own
 
✓ You can always store the Droid 2 in one of a variety of handsome 
carrying case accessories, some of which come in fine Naugahyde or 
leatherette.
 
✓ Don’t forget that the phone is in your pocket, especially in your coat or 
jacket. You might accidentally sit on the phone, or it could fly out when 
you take off your coat. The worst fate for the Droid 2, or any cell phone, 
is to take a trip through the wash. I’m sure the phone has nightmares 
about that happening.
Storing the Droid 2
I recommend that you find a place for your phone when you’re not taking it 
with you. Make the spot consistent: on top of your desk or workstation, in the 
kitchen, on the nightstand — you get the idea. Phones are as prone to being 
misplaced as are your car keys and glasses. Consistency is the key to finding 
your phone.
Then again, your phone does ring, so when you lose it, you can always have 
someone else call your cell phone to help you locate it.
 
✓ The Multimedia Station makes a handsome, permanent location for your 
Droid 2.
 
✓ I keep my Droid 2 on my desk, next to my computer. Conveniently, I 
have the charger plugged into the computer so that I keep the phone 
plugged in, connected, and charging when I’m not using it.
 
✓ Phones on coffee tables get buried under magazines and often squished 
when rude people put their feet on the furniture.
 
✓ Avoid putting the Droid 2 in direct sunlight; heat is a bad thing for any 
electronic gizmo.
 
✓ Do not put your phone in the laundry (see the preceding section). See 
Chapter 23 for information on properly cleaning the phone.

Initial Configuration
In This Chapter
▶ Setting up the Droid 2
▶ Turning on the phone
▶ Working with a Google account
▶ Snoozing the Droid 2
▶ Turning off your phone
T
he 20th century ushered in many amazing new inventions, just about 
none of which required any initial setup or configuration. When you 
bought a car, it was ready to run. When you bought a TV, you plugged it in 
and turned it on. When you bought a microwave oven, you searched for a 
tepid cup of coffee and then marveled at how the brew heated up — in 
its own mug, no less. Those were simple times.
Like most things in this 21st century world, your Droid 2 
requires some initial configuration. It’s unavoidable. 
Even if the Nice People In The Store set up your 
phone and did all the stuff they do (whatever it is), 
your phone needs input from you to complete the 
setup process. It’s all part of the 21st century, and 
getting the most from your Droid 2.
Oh, this chapter also covers the official ways of 
turning your phone on and off, as well as putting the 
phone to sleep and waking it again.
Greetings, Human
One of the most basic operations for any gizmo is knowing how to turn it 
on. Don’t bother looking: The Droid 2 doesn’t have an on-off switch. Instead, 
it has a Power button. It can be used in several ways, which is why I had to 
write this section, to explain things.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
 
The Droid 2 doesn’t turn on unless its battery is installed and fully charged. 
Sure, you can try turning on the phone without a battery, but it takes forever. 
See Chapter 1.
Turning on the Droid 2 for the first time
Before turning on your Droid 2 for the first time, ensure that it has been con-
figured. The folks at the store may have completed the configuration for you. 
If not, you may need to call your cell phone provider before you turn on the 
phone. A notice inside the box alerts you to the process.
To turn on the Droid 2 for the first time, press the Power button. You see the 
Motorola logo, the word Droid, and some fancy graphics and animation. After 
a moment, you hear the phone say, robotically, “Droid!” Don’t be alarmed. 
Well, at least its response is better than the one you hear when you turn on 
one of those inexpensive phones, which greets you with the phrase “You 
cheap bastard.”
When you turn on your phone for the first time, you have to do some setup. 
This step is required, and it may have been done by the folks who sold you 
the Droid 2. If not, you can follow along here when you first start the phone 
and see the Android character prompting you to get started:
 
1. Obey the instructions on the touchscreen display and touch the 
Android icon.
 
2. If you’re prompted, touch the Activate button to activate your phone.
 
 The Activation notice doesn’t appear when the nice people who sold 
you your phone configured it for you. So, when you buy your phone 
directly from Verizon or someone else on the Internet, you have to suffer 
through the activation process.
 
 If you don’t need to activate your phone, skip to Step 5.
 
3. Heed the directions of the robot.
 
 Touch the Speaker button so that you can hear what the robot is saying 
and punch numbers into the dialpad on the touchscreen when necessary.
 
4. Touch the Next button after activating your phone.
 
 You’re presented with a tutorial, which tells you about your Droid 2 and 
how it works.
 
5. Touch the Begin button to view the tutorial.
 
 Or, you can touch the Skip button to proceed with basic configuration.
 
 If you opt to continue with the tutorial, obey the directions on the 
screen. Remember that I offer, elsewhere in this book, detailed instruc-
tions for using the touchscreen and the Droid 2 keyboards.

 Chapter 2: Initial Configuration
 
6. Touch the Next button.
 
 You should have a Google account with your phone, especially because 
it says “with Google™” on the back. If you don’t already have a Google 
account, set one up right now.
 
 Setting up a Google account using your computer is easier than using 
the phone. See the section “Account Creation and Synchronization 
Setup” for more information on using a Google account with the Droid 2.
 
 If you have multiple Google accounts, sign in to the phone using the pri-
mary account or the one that has the calendar you use most often.
 
7. Choose the Sign In button to sign in to your existing Google account.
 
8. Touch the first text field, where you enter your Google account name.
 
 A keyboard appears at the bottom of the touchscreen.
 
9. Use the onscreen keyboard to type your Google account name.
 
 Feel free to use the phone’s slider keyboard, if you prefer it, though 
I recommend first reviewing Chapter 4 to get comfortable with that 
keyboard. Otherwise, these steps assume that you’re using the 
onscreen keyboard.
 
 The Google account name is also the first part of your Gmail email 
account. For example, my Gmail account name is dan.gookin.
 
 Touch the onscreen keyboard’s Delete button to back up if you make 
a mistake.
 
10. Touch the Password text box.
 
11. Type your Google account password.
 
 Each character in the password appears briefly as you type it, and then 
the character turns into a black dot. So pay attention to what you type!
 
 Touch the onscreen keyboard’s Shift key to display capital letters.
 
 
 Touch the onscreen keyboard’s Symbols key to see numbers and a 
smattering of other symbols that might dwell in your Google account 
password.
 
12. Touch the Sign In button.
 
 
 If you can’t see the Sign In button, touch the Done button on the key-
board or, if that’s not available, touch the Back soft button, found at the 
bottom of the touchscreen (and shown in the margin).
 
13. Ensure that a check mark appears by the option Back Up Data with My 
Google Account.
 
 By checking this option, you ensure that information you enter in your 
phone is always synchronized and backed up to your Google account on 
the Internet. It’s a good idea.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
 
14. Touch the Next button.
 
15. Touch the Finish Setup button.
You may be asked additional setup and configuration questions. Plow 
through them, if you will, or you generally have an option to skip things by 
touching the Skip button on the touchscreen.
If you find any option that perplexes you, use this book’s Index to look up the 
item and glean more information.
After the initial setup, you’re taken to the Home screen. Chapter 3 offers 
more Home screen information, which you should probably read right away 
before the temptation to play with the Droid 2 becomes unbearable.
 
✓ If you have more than one Google account, you have to manually add 
that account after you initially configure your Droid 2. See the later sec-
tion “Setting up a Google account on your phone.”
 
✓ The Droid 2 works closely with your Google account, sharing informa-
tion you have on the Internet for your email and contacts on Gmail, 
appointments on the Google Calendar, plus other Google applications.
 
✓ A Google account is free. Google makes bazillions of dollars by sell-
ing advertising on the web, so they don’t charge you for your Google 
account or any of the fine services they offer.
 
✓ You will find that your phone has automatically synched with your 
Google account after initial setup. Your contacts, calendar appoint-
ments, and Google Talk pals will already be configured for you on your 
Droid 2.
 
✓ When your various Google accounts (email messages and calendar 
appointments, for example) are holding a massive amount of informa-
tion, the Droid 2 may take a while to fully synchronize everything. 
An appropriate message appears on the phone during these long 
waiting periods.
 
✓ You can also configure your phone to work with other information-
sharing services, such as those offered by your company or organization. 
See the section “Configuring the Droid 2 for corporate use” later in 
this chapter.
Turning on the phone
Unlike turning the phone on for the first time, turning it on after that isn’t that 
involved. In fact, normally you probably won’t be turning the Droid 2 off that 
much. When you have turned the phone off, turning it on again is done by 
pressing and releasing the Power button, found atop the phone.

 Chapter 2: Initial Configuration
After pressing the Power button, the phone turns itself on. You’ll see the 
Droid 2 logo and animation, and the phone may scream “Droid!” at you. 
Eventually you’ll be plopped into an unlocking screen.
The primary unlocking screen is shown in Figure 2-1. To access your phone, 
use your finger to slide the padlock icon to the right.
Slide to the right to

Figure 2-1: Unlocking the phone.
A second unlocking screen, shown in Figure 2-2, uses an unlock pattern to 
help prevent unauthorized access to your phone. Drag your finger over the 
dots on the screen, duplicating the pattern you’ve preset. Only after you drag 
over the dots in the proper sequence is the phone unlocked.
Additional security locking screens involve your punching in a numeric 
PIN to gain access to the phone or typing in a password. If you’re prompted, 
use the onscreen keyboard to input the PIN or password to gain access to 
your phone.

Figure 2-2: Tracing the phone’s security pattern.
Eventually, you see the Home screen, which is where you control the phone, 
run applications, and do all sorts of interesting things. The Home screen is 
covered in Chapter 3.
 
✓ The locking pattern, PIN, and password screens appear only when 
you’ve configured those items on your Droid 2. They add a level of 
security that the normal locking screen (shown in Figure 2-1) doesn’t 
provide. See Chapter 22.
 
✓ PIN stands for personal identification number.
 
✓ After unlocking the phone, you may hear some alerts or see notifica-
tions. These messages inform you of various activities taking place in 
the phone, such as new email, scheduled appointments, updated apps, 
and more. See Chapter 3 for information on notifications.
 
✓ Even if the phone has a security pattern, PIN, or password, you can still 
make emergency calls: Touch the Emergency Call button, as illustrated 
in Figure 2-2.
 
✓ For information on turning off the phone, see the section “Turning off 
the phone,” later in this chapter.

 Chapter 2: Initial Configuration
Waking up the phone
Most of the time, you don’t turn off your phone. Instead, the phone does the 
electronic equivalent of falling asleep. Either the phone falls asleep on its 
own (after you’ve ignored it for a while), or you can put it to sleep by singing 
it a lullaby or following the information in the section “Snoozing the phone,” 
later in this chapter.
In Sleep mode, the phone is still on and it can still receive calls (as well as 
email and other notifications), but the touchscreen is turned off.
The phone wakes itself up whenever it receives a call; you see the unlock 
screen, similar to the one shown earlier, in Figure 2-1, though information 
about the person calling appears on the touchscreen: Slide the unlock tab to 
the right to unlock and answer the phone.
When the phone isn’t ringing, you can wake it at any time by pressing the 
Power button. A simple, short press is all that’s needed. The phone awakens, 
yawns, and turns on the touchscreen display, and you can then unlock the 
phone as described in the preceding section.
 
✓ Touching the touchscreen when the screen is off doesn’t wake up 
the phone.
 
✓ Pressing the camera shutter button while the phone is sleeping doesn’t 
wake up the phone.
 
✓ Loud noises will not wake up the phone.
 
✓ The phone doesn’t snore while it’s sleeping.
There’s an Android in your phone
You might see or hear the term Android used 
in association with your phone. That’s because 
your phone, like your computer, has an operat-
ing system — the main program in charge of 
a computer’s hardware. The operating system 
controls everything. For the Droid 2, that operat-
ing system is Android.
The Android operating system was developed by 
Google. Well, actually, it was started by  another 
company that Google gobbled. Anyway: 
Android is based on the popular Linux operating 
system, used to power desktop computers and 
larger, more expensive, computers all over the 
world. Android offers a version of Linux cus-
tomized for mobile devices, such as the Droid 2, 
but also for other cell phone brands that I can’t 
recall right now.
Because the Droid 2 uses the Android operating 
system, your phone has access to thousands of 
software programs. The entire process is cov-
ered in Chapter 20.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
 
✓ See the section “Snoozing the phone,” later in this chapter, for informa-
tion on manually putting the phone to sleep.
 
✓ The pattern lock, PIN, and password prompts don’t appear when you’re 
answering the phone; only the sliding lock (see Figure 2-1) is used.
Account Creation and Synchronization Setup
After initially turning on your phone and getting things configured, you’re 
ready to go. Well, that is, unless you opted to skip the account synchroniza-
tion step or you just didn’t get a chance to synchronize the proper accounts. 
Don’t fret! The Droid 2 welcomes your ability to procrastinate by providing 
more account synchronization options, as described in this section.
Getting a Google account
 
It helps immensely to have a Google account to get the most from your 
Droid 2 phone. If you don’t already have a Google account, run — don’t 
walk or stroll — to a computer and follow these steps to create your own 
Google account:
 
1. Open the computer’s Web browser program.
 
2. Visit the main Google page at www.google.com.
 
 Type www.google.com into the Web browser’s Address box.
 
3. Click the Sign In link.
 
 Another page opens where you can log in to your Google account, but 
you don’t have a Google account, so:
 
4. Click the link to create a new account.
 
 The link is typically found beneath the text boxes where you would 
log in to your Google account. As I write this chapter, the link is titled 
Create an Account Now.
 
5. Continue heeding the directions until you’ve created your own 
Google account.
Eventually, your account is set up and configured. I recommend that you log 
off and then log back on to Google, just to ensure that you did everything 
properly. Also create a bookmark for your account’s Google page: Pressing 
Ctrl+D or Command+D does that job in just about any Web browser.

 Chapter 2: Initial Configuration
Continue reading in the next section for information on synchronizing your 
new Google account with the Droid 2 phone.
 
✓ The Google account gives you access to a wide array of free services 
and online programs. These include Gmail for electronic messaging, 
Calendar for scheduling and appointments, the online picture sharing 
program Picasa, and an account on YouTube, along with Google Finance, 
blogs, Google Buzz, and other features that are also instantly shared 
with your phone.
 
✓ Information on using the various Google programs on your phone is cov-
ered throughout this book; specifically, in Part IV.
Setting up a Google account on your phone
The only time you need to set up a Google account for your Droid 2 is when 
you neglected to initially set up the account when you first bought the phone, 
you postponed setup, or you’re adding a second Google account you already 
have. If you have the Google account already set up, great: Just concentrate 
on working through the steps in this section.
If you haven’t yet configured a Google account, though, follow the steps in 
the preceding section and then continue with these steps:
 
1. Go to the Home screen.
 
 
 The Home screen is the Droid 2’s main screen. You can always get 
there by pressing the Home soft button, found at the bottom of the 
touchscreen.
 
2. Touch the Launcher button.
 
 
 The Launcher button is found at the lower center of the Home screen. 
Touching this button displays the Applications Tray, which lists icons 
representing every application installed on your phone.
 
3. Scroll the list of program icons to locate the My Accounts icon.
 
 Scroll the list by using your finger; touch the screen and slide your 
finger up, toward the top of the phone.
 
 The application icons are arranged in alphabetical order, so the My 
Accounts icon might be partway down the list.
 
4. Touch the Add Account button.
 
5. Choose Google.

Changing your Google password
Experts say that you should change your computer passwords often. How 
often? Well, I know some government agencies where the password changes 
every 90 seconds. You don’t need to be that severe with your Google account 
password.
When you change your Google password, do so on your computer first. Then 
you have to inform the Droid 2 of the new password. If you don’t, your phone 
complains that it cannot access Google to update and synchronize informa-
tion. Follow these steps to reset your Google password:

 Chapter 2: Initial Configuration
 
1. On your desktop computer, direct the Web browser to go to the main 
Google page: www.google.com.
 
2. From the top of the page, click the Settings link.
 
 As I write this chapter, the link is found in the upper right part of 
the page.
 
3. Choose Google Account Settings from the Settings link menu.
 
4. By the Security heading, click the link Change Password.
 
5. Obey the directions on the screen for setting a new password.
 
 Now that the password is reset, you need to update the Droid 2 with 
that information. If you don’t, the phone pesters you incessantly. 
Continue with these steps:
 
6. Wake up or turn on your Droid 2.
 
 
 In a few moments, your phone generates a notification. You see an Alert 
icon appear on the top of the phone’s display, in the notification area.
 
7. Slide down the notification area down by swiping it with your finger.
 
 The specific instructions for performing this action are covered in 
Chapter 3.
 
8. From the list of notifications, choose Alert.
 
 The Alert message says Sign-In Error or Sign Into Your Account.
 
9. Type the new Google password into the box that appears on the touch-
screen display.
 
 Refer to information in the earlier sections “Turning on the Droid 2 for 
the first time” as well as “Setting up a Google account on your phone” 
for more information on typing in your Google account password.

continues to sync the Google account information.
 
 Press the Home soft button to return to the Home screen.
Configuring the Droid 2 for corporate use
Whether you’re a mind-numbed corporate robot or in complete denial 
regarding your menial status at a large organization, you may be required to 
set up your Droid 2 for synchronizing with your outfit’s Exchange Server. The 
idea is to put your phone on speaking terms with your organization’s email, 
calendar, contact, and other types of information.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
First of all, if your company is really big, you’ll probably have someone do 
all the account setup for you. In fact, that person might even apply special 
restrictions to the Droid 2, preventing such innocent diversions as play-
ing your Santa Shoots the Monkey game or using the Maps app to locate a 
bookie. Regardless, those digital martinets will probably do the setup for 
you or at least have instructions ready. Defy those folks at your own peril.
To set up the Droid 2 on your own, follow these steps:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Launcher button.
 
2. Touch the My Accounts icon.
 
3. Touch the Add Account button at the bottom of the screen.
 
4. Choose Corporate Sync.
 
5. If prompted, touch the check box by the text I Agree so that you can 
agree to the terms and conditions, and then touch the Next button.
 
6. Fill in the blanks with the information provided to you by your 
organization.
 
 Touch each field to summon the onscreen keyboard and then type the 
information required: domain\username, password, email address, and 
server. You can also use the sliding keyboard, if you prefer.
 
7. Touch the Next button.
 
 You may have to touch the Done button on the onscreen keyboard so 
that you can see the Next button.
 
 The Droid 2 attempts to contact and chat with the server.
 
8. Touch the Finish button.
And you’re done. Of course, other things may or may not happen at this 
point, depending on what is shared on your corporate network and how you 
use the Droid 2 to access that information.
 
 You can press the Home soft button to return to the Home screen, from 
whence you may do other interesting things with your Droid 2.
Goodbye, Phone
You can dismiss your Droid 2 from existence in one of three ways. The first 
way is to put the phone to sleep, to snooze it. The second is to turn the 
phone off. The third involves a trained hypnotist, a pound of chicken feath-
ers, and an industrial vat of mayonnaise. Because of space constraints, the 
third method is not covered in this edition of the book.

 Chapter 2: Initial Configuration
Snoozing the phone
To snooze the phone, press and release the Power button. No matter what 
you’re doing, the phone’s display turns off. The phone itself isn’t off, but the 
touchscreen display turns off. The phone enters a low-power state to save 
battery life and also to relax.
 
✓ You can snooze the phone while you’re making a call. Simply press and 
release the Power button. The call stays connected, but the display is 
turned off.
 
✓ The Droid 2 will probably spend most of its time in Snooze mode.
 
✓ Snooze mode allows you to keep talking on the phone while you put it in 
your pocket. In Snooze mode, your pocket is in no danger of accidentally 
hanging up or muting the phone in the middle of a call.
 
✓ Snoozing does not turn off the phone; you can still receive calls while 
the phone is somnolent.
 
✓ Any timers or alarms you set are still activated when the phone is snooz-
ing. See Chapter 19 for information on setting timers and alarms.
 
✓ To wake up the phone, press and release the Power button. See the 
section “Waking up the phone,” earlier in this chapter.
Controlling snooze options
There’s no need to manually snooze your Droid 2. That’s because it has a 
built-in timeout: After a period of inactivity, or boredom, the phone snoozes 
itself automatically — just like Grandpa Chester does when Grandma starts 
talking politics.
You have control over the snooze timeout value, which can be set anywhere 
from 15 seconds to 30 minutes. Obey these steps:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Launcher button.
 
2. Touch the Settings icon to open the Settings window.
 
3. Choose Display.
 
4. Choose Screen Timeout.
 
5. Choose a timeout value from the list that’s provided.
 
 The standard value is 1 minute.
 
 
6. Press the Home soft button to return to the Home screen.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
When you don’t touch the screen, or you aren’t using the phone, the sleep 
timer starts ticking. About ten seconds before the timeout value you set 
(refer to Step 5), the touchscreen dims. Then it goes to sleep. If you touch the 
screen before then, the sleep timer is reset.
Turning off the phone
To turn off your phone, follow these steps:
 
1. Press and hold the Power button.
 
 Eventually, you see the Phone Options menu, shown in Figure 2-3.
Figure 2-3: The Phone Options menu.
 
2. Choose the Power Off item.
 
 Off goes the phone, crying out “Droid” as it goes.
The phone doesn’t receive calls when it’s turned off. Those calls instead go 
to voicemail, either the voicemail you set up with the cellular service or to 
Visual Voicemail. See Chapter 7 for more information on voicemail.
 
 If you change your mind and don’t want to shut down the phone, press the 
Back soft button to cancel.

T
he dumbest and simplest devices are the easiest to use. Because 
there’s a simplicity in the design of a pencil, for example, 
just about anyone can pick it up and figure out how it 
works. The same design philosophy applies to a shovel 
or a hammer. The dumber the device, the easier it is 
to pick up and use right away. After all, you don’t see 
the book Scissors For Dummies (at least not yet).
Complex devices can be frightening. That fear 
holds especially true for an advanced smartphone 
such as the Droid 2. The gizmo is identifiable to 
any denizen of the 21st century as a cell phone, but, 
really, how do you make it work? To help ease you 
on your way, I’m offering this chapter as a Droid 2 
orientation and guide. You can read about your 
phone’s interface, how it works, and how to get the most 
from your new phone experience.

Basic Droid 2 Operations
The Droid 2 is most likely different from any other phone you’ve owned. Even 
if you owned the original Droid, some things work differently on the Droid 2. 
To help familiarize yourself with how the phone works, this section covers 
some basic phone operations.
Using the soft buttons
Below the touchscreen are four buttons labeled with four icons. They’re the 
soft buttons, and they perform specific functions no matter what you’re doing 
with the phone. Table 3-1 lists the soft buttons’ functions in order, from left 
to right.

ple, if there’s no menu to open, pressing the Menu button does nothing. 
When a menu is visible, pressing the Menu soft button hides it.
The soft buttons can still be used when the sliding keyboard is extended. 
Also, buttons on the sliding keyboard duplicate the function of the Search 
and Back soft buttons.
You can control what happens when you press the Home soft button twice. 
The function, double-tap Home, is covered in Chapter 22.

 Chapter 3: The Droid 2 Tour
Various sections throughout this book give examples for using the soft but-
tons. Their images appear in the book’s margins where relevant.
Manipulating the touchscreen
The touchscreen works in combination with one or two of your fingers. 
You can choose which fingers to use, or whether to be adventurous and try 
using the tip of your nose, but touch the touchscreen you must. Choose from 
several techniques:
Touch: In this simple operation, you touch the screen. Generally, you’re 
touching an object, such as a program icon, or a control, such as a gizmo you 
use to slide something around.
Double-tap: Touch the screen in the same location twice. A double-tap can be 
used to zoom in on an image or a map, but it can also zoom out. Because of 
the double-tap’s dual nature, I recommend using the pinch or spread opera-
tion instead.
Long-press: Touch and hold part of the screen. Some operations on the Droid 2, 
such as moving an icon on the Home screen, begin with the long-press.
Swipe: When you swipe, you start with your finger in one spot and then drag 
it to another spot. Usually, a swipe is up, down, left, or right, which moves 
material displayed in the direction you swipe your finger. A swipe can be fast 
or slow. It’s also called a flick.
Pinch: A pinch involves two fingers, which start out separated and then are 
brought together. The effect is used to reduce an image or a map. The pinch 
is used to zoom out.
Spread: In the opposite of a pinch, you start with your fingers together and 
then spread them. The spread is used to zoom in.
 
You cannot use the touchscreen while wearing gloves, unless they’re gloves 
specially designed for using electronic touchscreens, such as the gloves that 
Batman wears.
Setting the volume
The phone’s volume controls are found on the right side of the phone as it’s 
facing you. Press the top part of the button to raise the volume. Press the 
bottom part of the button to lower the volume.
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
42
Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
The volume controls work for whatever noise the phone is making at the 
time: When you’re on the phone, the volume controls set the level of the 
phone call. When you’re listening to music or watching a video, the volume 
controls set that media volume.
The volume can be preset for the phone, media, and notifications. See 
Chapter 22 for information.
“Silence your phone!”
You cannot be a citizen of the 21st century and not have heard the admoni-
tion “Please silence your cell phones.” The quick way to obey that command 
with your Droid 2 phone is to keep pressing the Volume Down button 
until the phone vibrates. What you’ve done is set the phone into Silent-and-
Vibrate mode.
The Droid 2 can also be silenced with a swipe of your finger by obeying 
these steps:
 
1. Wake up the phone.
 
 Obviously, if the phone is turned off, you have no need to turn it on just 
to make it silent. So, assuming that your phone is snoozing, press the 
Power button to see the unlock screen (refer to Figure 2-1, in Chapter 2).
 
 
2. Slide the Silencer button over to the left.
 
 You’re good.
Finally, you can thrust the Droid 2 into Silence mode by pressing and holding 
the Power button. From the Phone Options menu, choose Silent mode.
 
 
✓ When the phone is silenced and in Vibration mode, the Vibration icon 
appears on the status bar, as shown in the margin.
 
✓ You make the phone noisy again by undoing any of the steps in this sec-
tion, though the easiest method is to repeat Steps 1 and 2. In Step 2, the 
Silencer button is the un-Silencer button.
 
✓ Also see Chapter 22 for various other methods of silencing the phone.
Going horizontal
The Droid 2 features an accelerometer gizmo. It’s used by various programs in 
the phone to determine in which direction the phone is pointed or whether 
you’ve reoriented the phone from an upright to a horizontal position.

 Chapter 3: The Droid 2 Tour
The easiest way to see how the vertical-horizontal orientation feature works 
is to view a Web page on your Droid 2. Obey these steps:
 
1. Touch the Browser application on the Home screen.
 
 The Droid 2 launches its Web browser program, venturing out to the 
Internet. Eventually, the browser’s first page, the home page, appears on 
the touchscreen.
 
2. Tilt the Droid 2 to the left.
 
 As shown in Figure 3-1, the Web page reorients itself to the new, horizon-
tal way of looking at the Web. For some applications, it’s truly the best 
way to see things.
 
3. Tilt the phone upright again.
 
 The Web page redisplays itself in its original, upright mode.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
Oh, and don’t bother turning the phone upside down and expect the image 
to flip that way, though some applications may delight you by supporting 
this feature.
 
✓ Landscape mode is entered regardless of the phone’s orientation when 
you extend the sliding keyboard. See Chapter 4 for more information on 
the sliding keyboard.
 
✓ See Chapter 11 for more information on using your phone to browse 
the Web.
 
✓ Some applications switch the view from portrait to landscape orienta-
tion when you tilt the phone. Most applications, however, are fixed to 
portrait orientation.
 
✓ Some applications present themselves only in Landscape view, such as 
the YouTube application when playing a video.
 
✓ A useful application for demonstrating the Droid 2 accelerometer is the 
game Labyrinth. It can be purchased at the Android Market, or a free ver-
sion, Labyrinth Lite, can be downloaded. See Chapter 20 for more infor-
mation on the Android Market.
There’s No Screen Like Home
The first thing you see after you unlock your Droid 2 is the Home screen, illus-
trated in Figure 3-2. It’s also the location you go to whenever you end a phone 
call or quit an application.
Here are the key items to notice on the Home screen, illustrated in Figure 3-2:
status bar: The top of the Home screen is a thin, informative strip that I 
call the status bar. It contains notification icons and status icons, plus the 
current time.
notification icons: These icons come and go depending on what happens in 
your digital life. For example, new icons appear whenever you receive a new 
email message or have a pending appointment. The section “Reviewing notifi-
cations,” later in this chapter, describes how to deal with notifications.
status icons: These icons represent the phone’s current condition, such as 
the type of network it’s connected to, signal strength, and battery status, as 
well as whether the speaker has been muted or a Wi-Fi network connected, 
for example.
widgets: A widget is a teensy program that can display information, let you 
control the phone, or access features. Touching a widget can manipulate a 
phone feature, access a program, or do something purely amusing. You can 
read more about widgets in Chapter 22.

Launcher: Touching the Launcher button displays the Applications Tray, a 
scrolling list of all applications installed on your phone. The section “The 
Applications Tray,” later in this chapter, describes how it works.
And now, the secret: The Home screen is seven times wider than what you 
see on the front of your Droid 2. The Home screen has left and right wings, as 
illustrated in Figure 3-3.
To view the left or right side of the Home screen, swipe your finger across 
the touchscreen display to the left or right. The Home screen slides over one 
page in whichever direction you swipe.

Way too many widgets
Main Home screen
Way too many widgets
App icons galore
Figure 3-3: All the Home screens.
The wider Home screen gives you more opportunities to place applications 
and widgets. Also shown in Figure 3-3 are shortcut icons, widgets, and fold-
ers, which provide quick access to more of the phone’s features and help to 
keep things organized.
 
✓ The Home screen is entirely customizable. You can add and remove 
icons from the Home screen, add widgets, shortcuts, even change the 
wallpaper images. See Chapter 22 for more information.
 
✓ Touching part of the Home screen that doesn’t feature an icon or con-
trol doesn’t do anything — that is, unless you’re using the live wallpaper 
feature. In that case, touching the screen changes the wallpaper in some 
way, depending on the wallpaper that’s selected. You can read more 
about live wallpaper in Chapter 22.
 
✓ The variety of notification and status icons is broad. You see the icons 
referenced in appropriate sections throughout this book.
 
✓ No matter which part of the Home screen you’re viewing, the top part of 
the touchscreen stays the same, as do the display notification and status 
icons and the time.
 
✓ The bottom part of the Home screen always displays the Phone, 
Launcher, and Contacts icons. That is, unless you just swiped the screen 
left or right. In that case, you briefly see some icons that show you 
which specific part of the Home screen you’re viewing.
 
 
✓ To return to the Home screen at any time, press the Home soft button.

 Chapter 3: The Droid 2 Tour
I’ve Been Working on the Home Screen
I recommend getting to know three basic Home screen operations: reviewing 
notifications, starting programs, and accessing widgets.
Reviewing notifications
Notifications appear as icons at the top of the Home screen, as illustrated ear-
lier, in Figure 3-2. To see what the notifications say, peel down the top part of 
the screen, as shown in Figure 3-4.
Notiﬁcation icons
Touch here
Drag your ﬁnger down to 
display the notiﬁcations
Figure 3-4: Accessing notifications.
The operation works like this:
 
1. Touch the notification icons at the top of the touchscreen.
 
2. Swipe your finger all the way down the front of the touchscreen.
 
 This action works like controlling a roll-down blind: You grab the top 
part of the touchscreen and drag it downward all the way. The notifica-
tions appear in a list, shown in Figure 3-5.
www.it-ebooks.info

48
Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
 
 Drag the notification list all the way to the bottom of the touchscreen, to 
prevent it from rolling back up again. Use the notification panel control 
to pull the list all the way down, as shown in Figure 3-5.
 
3. Touch a notification to see what’s up.
Touching a notification takes you to the program that generated the alert. For 
example, touching a Gmail notification displays a new message in the inbox.
 
Touch a notiﬁcation to see more
information or deal with an issue
Dismiss all notiﬁcations
Notiﬁcation Panel control
Figure 3-5: The notification list.
If you choose not to touch a notification, you can “roll up” the notification list 
by sliding the panel control back to the top of the touchscreen.
 
✓ A notification icon disappears after you’ve chosen it.
 
✓ A notification icon also goes away when you start the program that gen-
erated the alert. For example, Gmail notifications disappear when you 
start Gmail and read pending messages.

49
 Chapter 3: The Droid 2 Tour
 
✓ To dismiss all notification icons, touch the Clear button, shown in 
Figure 3-5.
 
 
✓ When more notifications are present than can be shown on the status 
bar, you see the More Notifications icon displayed, as shown in the 
margin. The number on the icon indicates how many additional 
notifications are available.
 
✓ Dismissing notifications doesn’t prevent them from appearing again 
later. For example, notifications to update your programs continue to 
appear, as do calendar reminders.
 
✓ Some programs, such as Facebook and the various Twitter apps, don’t 
display notifications unless you’re logged in. See Chapter 12.
 
✓ When new notifications are available, the Droid 2 notification light flashes. 
Refer to Chapter 1 for information on locating the notification light.
 
✓ See Chapter 19 for information on dismissing calendar reminders.
 
✓ Notification icons appear on the screen when the phone is locked. You 
must unlock the phone before you can drag down the status bar to dis-
play notifications.
Starting an application
It’s cinchy to run an application on the Home screen: Touch its icon. The 
application starts.
 
✓ Not all applications appear on the Home screen, but all of them do 
appear when you display the Applications Tray. See the section “The 
Applications Tray,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ When an application closes or you quit that application, you return to 
the Home screen.
 
✓ Application is abbreviated as app.
Accessing a widget
Widgets are teensy programs that “float” over the Home screen, as shown in 
Figure 3-3. To use a widget, simply touch it. What happens after that depends 
on the widget.
For example, touching the Weather widget displays a pop-up window with 
more weather information. Touching the Google widget displays the onscreen 
keyboard and lets you type, or dictate, something to search for on the Internet. 
The Power Control widgets turn off or on various phone features.
Information on these and other widgets appears elsewhere in this book. See 
Chapter 22 for information on working with widgets.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
Using Car Home
The Droid 2 features an alternative Home screen, provided for the scary 
proposition of using your phone while driving an automobile. The Car Home 
screen, shown much earlier, in Figure 1-8, is designed to be easy to see at a 
glance and offers you access to the phone’s more popular features without 
distracting you too much from the priority of piloting your car.
The Car Home screen appears automatically whenever your Droid 2 is 
nestled into the car mount phone holder accessory, discussed in Chapter 1. 
To see Car Home manually, you start the Car Dock app: Touch the Launcher 
button on the Home screen, scroll the list of applications, and touch the Car 
Dock icon.
 
✓ The Car Home screen features big, fat buttons linking to common tasks 
you’d need the phone for in a car, mostly to use maps and navigation, 
plus some basic phone features.
 
✓ You can add an app shortcut to the Car Home screen by touching the 
Add App button. Choose an app from the list that’s displayed.
 
✓ To delete or replace an app shortcut that has already been added 
to the Car Home screen, press the Menu soft button and choose the 
Preferences command. Choose the Custom item on the Car Dock Setting 
screen to change the app shortcut on the Car Home screen.
 
✓ To return to the Droid 2’s normal Home screen, touch the Close button 
on the Car Home screen.
The Applications Tray
The place where you find all applications installed on your Droid 2 is the 
Applications Tray. Though you may find shortcuts to applications (apps) 
on the Home screen, the Applications Tray is where you need to go to 
find everything.
Discovering all the apps on your phone
To start a program — an app — on the Droid 2, heed these steps:
 
 
1. Touch the Launcher button at the bottom of the Home screen.
 
 The Applications Tray appears, as shown in Figure 3-6. App icons are 
listed alphabetically, which still goes from a to z, as far as I can tell.
 
2. Scroll the list of app icons by swiping your finger up or down.
 
3. Touch an icon to start that app.

The Droid 2 searching abilities can be used to find apps on your phone as 
well as lost contacts, music, and stuff on the Internet. The key is knowing 
how to use the Search command to locate an app. Follow these steps:
 
1. Press the Search soft button.
 
 
 The Search screen appears. The Search text box appears atop the 
screen, and the phone’s onscreen keyboard appears at the bottom.
 
2. Use your finger to type all or part of the app’s name.
 
 See Chapter 4 for more information on using the onscreen keyboard, as 
well as for using the sliding keyboard if you prefer real tiny buttons over 
virtual tiny buttons.
 
 As you type, items whose names match the letters you’ve typed appear 
in the list. The word Application appears beneath the program name of 
any applications in the list.

3. Scroll the list to explore the apps that have been found.
 
 Use your finger to swipe the list up and down.
 
4. Touch the name of the app you’re looking for.
 
 The app starts.
Searching for apps is a small part of searching for all kinds of information on 
the Droid 2, such as contact information, appointments, and email. Various 
chapters throughout this book describe other ways you can use the Droid 2 
search function.
See Chapter 20 for information on how to use the Android Market to get more 
apps for your phone.
Reviewing your most recently used apps
 
 If you’re like me, you probably use the same apps over and over, on both 
your computer and your phone. You can easily access that list of recent pro-
grams on the Droid 2 by pressing and holding the Home soft button. When 
you do, you see the eight most recently accessed programs, similar to the 
ones shown in Figure 3-7.
Figure 3-7: Recently used apps.
 
 To exit the list of recently used apps, press the Back soft button.
You can press and hold the Home soft button in any application at any time 
to see the recently used apps list.
 
For programs you use all the time, consider creating shortcuts on the Home 
screen. Chapter 22 describes how to create shortcuts to apps, as well as short-
cuts to people and shortcuts to instant messaging and all sorts of fun stuff.

t’s the year 2134. You wake up in a pleasant though sterile room 
to the sound of soothing music. A door slides open and 
in walks a graceful mechanical being. It introduces itself 
as your personal Droid Z99, a descendant of what was 
originally a cell phone more than a century earlier. The 
Droid Z99 is your slave, dutifully obeying your every 
whim, supplying whatever you need. It seeks to 
fulfill any desire you have — as long as you never, 
ever, leave that room.
Though your introduction to the Droid 2 phone 
may not be as pleasant as a future introduction to 
a Droid Z99 robot, there’s no risk to you that your 
phone will make you a prisoner. To get that message 
through to the phone, you should know how to use the 
numerous Droid 2 keyboards in addition to voice input. 
That information is covered in this chapter, which I recom-
mend reading quickly, before your phone gets any wild ideas.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
Keyboard Mania
You can choose one of three types of keyboard to input text information into 
the Droid 2: the onscreen keyboard that appears on the touchscreen, the 
sliding keyboard, and the onscreen Swype keyboard, designed for superfast 
typing. The decision to have multiple keyboards was obviously put forward 
to confound and confuse you.
The onscreen keyboard is a virtual keyboard. As such, you benefit from 
seeing different keys, depending on what the phone is doing. Therefore, 
it’s more flexible, though not tactile.
The sliding keyboard is a teensy keyboard, similar to the one found on 
your computer, but made smaller. It allows you the luxury of having a 
physical keyboard on the Droid 2, which many folks find preferable over 
the onscreen keyboard.
The Swype keyboard looks like the onscreen keyboard, and can be used as 
such, but its strength lies in its ability to interpret as text the rapid squiggles 
and smears of your finger on the screen.
 
✓ This book holds no favor of one keyboard over another, though I must 
confess a personal preference for the onscreen keyboard.
 
✓ The following sections discuss the specifics of using each type 
of keyboard.
 
✓ Because using the Swype keyboard is much different from the hunt-and-
peck nature of using either the onscreen or sliding keyboard, Swype is 
covered in its own section, later in this chapter.
 
✓ The Droid 2 also lets you dictate text into your phone. See the section 
“Voice Input,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ The Droid 2 sliding keyboard started out full size. But then the scientists 
at Motorola zapped it using that huge shrinking machine the US govern-
ment built under the Utah desert — you know, the same machine that 
shrunk Stephen Boyd and Raquel Welch in Fantastic Voyage.
Using the onscreen keyboard
The touchy-glassy way to input text information on your phone is to use the 
onscreen keyboard. It shows up anytime the phone demands text as input, 
such as when you’re composing email, typing a text message, or composing a 
ransom note in Gmail.
Normally, the onscreen keyboard just pops up; for example, when you touch 
a text field or an input box on a Web page. Then you start typing with your 
finger or — if you’re really good — with your thumbs.

The key in the lower right corner changes its look depending on what you’re 
typing. The key has five variations, as shown in the figure. Here’s what each 
one does:
Enter/Return: Just like the Enter or Return key on your computer key-
board, this key ends a paragraph of text. It’s used mostly when filling in 
long stretches of text or when multiline input is available.
Done: Use this key to dismiss the onscreen keyboard and view the app 
full-screen. Normally, this key appears when you’ve finished typing text 
in the final field of a screen with several fields.
Go: This action key directs the app to proceed with a search, accept 
input, or perform another action.
Next: This key appears when typing information into multiple fields. 
Touching the key switches from one field to the next, such as when 
typing a username and password.
:-) The smiley face key inserts a smile icon into your text.

The key to the left of the Space key changes as well. It can be the @ symbol 
or a comma, depending on the app. In programs that accept voice input, a 
Microphone icon appears. Touching the Microphone icon button activates 
voice input, as covered later in this chapter.

turns on, as shown in the figure.
To return to the standard alpha keyboard (refer to Figure 4-1), touch the 
ABC key.
 
✓ If you detest the onscreen keyboard, you can always use the sliding key-
board. See the later section “Sliding out the sliding keyboard.”
 
✓ Type with your finger first, and then eventually you get good enough to 
type with your thumbs. Or perhaps not; I still can’t thumb-type well.
 
✓ Some applications show the keyboard when the phone is in landscape 
orientation. If so, the keyboard shows the same keys but offers more 
room for your stump-like fingers to type.

 Chapter 4: Human-Droid Interaction
 
✓ Not every application features a horizontal keyboard, however, so you 
might be stuck using the narrower version of the keyboard.
 
✓ Alternative onscreen keyboards are available for use with your phone, 
such as the popular AnySoftKeyboard. See Chapter 20 for information on 
looking for apps in the Android Market.
 
✓ See Chapter 22 for information on how to adjust the onscreen keyboard.
Figure 4-3: Special characters on the Alt keyboard.
Sliding out the sliding keyboard
Like many popular cell phones, the Droid 2 features a real keyboard. The 
Droid 2 sliding keyboard is ensconced behind the touchscreen. You can 
slide out that keyboard (to the left as you face the phone) and use it if you 
prefer a physical keyboard for your cell phone typing chores.
Figure 4-4 illustrates a close-up of the sliding keyboard to call out its 
various parts.
Two sets of symbols share space on the sliding keyboard: one colored white 
and the other colored a pale blue. The pale blue characters are accessed by 
using the Alt and Alt Lock keys. See the later section “Typing on your Droid 2” 
for more information on typing with the sliding keyboard.
The sliding keyboard also features direction keys: up, down, right, and left, 
plus an OK key. Using these keys is covered later in this chapter, in the sec-
tion “Text Editing.”

Figure 4-4: Keys on the sliding keyboard.
When you’re done using the sliding keyboard, slide it back into the phone. 
The touchscreen may reorient itself back to Portrait mode when you do so, 
or the app may stay in its horizontal orientation.
Sliding the keyboard back into the phone doesn’t turn off or sleep the Droid 2.
 
✓ The sliding keyboard features duplicates of the Search and Back soft 
buttons.
 
✓ You can still use the soft buttons on the front of the Droid 2 in addition 
to the soft buttons found on the sliding keyboard.
 
✓ Refer to Figure 1-5, in Chapter 1, for a full overview of the sliding 
keyboard.
 
✓ The sliding keyboard is one reason that the Droid 2 weighs considerably 
more than other, similar smartphones.
Droid 2 Hunt-and-Peck
Yes, typing on a cell phone is a skill set all its own. Sure, it has a dictation fea-
ture. When you’re making a call, of course, you use your voice. But for many 
of the tasks you do on the Droid 2, you need to use a keyboard — either the 
onscreen keyboard or the sliding keyboard. The art of typing on those key-
boards is covered in this section.
Typing on your Droid 2
Using the Droid 2 keyboards works just as you expect: Touch the key you 
want and that character appears in the program you’re using. It’s magic!

 Chapter 4: Human-Droid Interaction
Typing can be quirky, depending on which keyboard you use, as covered in 
the sections that follow. For both keyboards, here are some helpful sugges-
tions and thoughts:
 
✓ A blinking cursor on the touchscreen shows where new text appears, 
which is similar to how text input works on your computer.
 
✓ When you make a mistake, press the Del key to back up and erase.
 
✓ See the later section “Text Editing” for more details on editing your text.
 
✓ Above all, type slowly until you get used to the keyboard.
 
✓ You can produce an automatic period at the end of a sentence by press-
ing the Space key twice. In fact, pressing the Space key twice at any time 
changes the first space you typed into a period. As a bonus, the next 
character you type automatically appears in uppercase, to start a new 
sentence.
 
✓ People generally accept that composing text on a phone isn’t perfect. 
Don’t sweat it if you make a few mistakes as you type instant messages 
or email, though you should expect some curious replies from unin-
tended typos.
 
✓ One way to get forgiveness for your typos is to include the signature 
Sent from my DROID in your email messages. See Chapter 10.
 
✓ When you type a password, the character you type appears briefly but, 
for security reasons, is then replaced by a black dot.
 
✓ When you tire of typing, you can always touch the Microphone key on 
the keyboard and enter Dictation mode. See the section “Voice Input,” 
later in this chapter.
Onscreen keyboard typing
As you type on the onscreen keyboard, the button you touch appears 
enlarged on the screen, as shown in Figure 4-5. That’s how you can confirm 
that your fingers are typing what you intend to type.
 
✓ To set the Caps Lock feature, press the Shift key twice. The little light 
highlighted in Figure 4-1 comes on, indicating that Caps Lock is on.
 
✓ Press the Shift key again to turn off Caps Lock.
 
✓ See the later section “Choosing a word as you type” to find out how to 
deal with automatic typo and spelling corrections.

Figure 4-5: Pressing the g key.
Sliding keyboard typing
Despite the capital letters on the sliding keyboard, the text you type appears 
in lowercase. To create a capital letter, you must press either Shift key (refer 
to Figure 4-4). Unlike using a computer keyboard, you don’t need to hold 
down the Shift key; just press and release and then type a letter.
 
 After the Shift key has been pressed, the cursor changes its appearance, 
as shown in the margin. It’s your clue that the next letter typed will be in 
uppercase.
 
 To activate Caps Lock, press the Shift key twice. The cursor changes its 
appearance, as shown in the margin. Press the Shift key again to release 
Caps Lock.
 
 Access the light-blue symbol characters by pressing the Alt key. As with the 
Shift key, you don’t need to press and hold the Alt key; just press and release. 
The cursor changes, as shown in the margin, to indicate that you’re typing 
symbols and not the letter key.
 
 To lock the symbols, press the Alt Lock key. The cursor changes again 
(as shown in the margin), and only the light-blue symbol characters are 
displayed as you type on the sliding keyboard. Press the Alt Lock key again 
to return to normal keyboard operation.

✓ You can also press the Alt key twice rather than press the Alt Lock key.
 
✓ The cursor may not change its appearance in every program you use. 
For example, in the Browser you may see only a vertical line for 
the cursor.
Accessing special characters
You can type more characters on your phone than are shown on either the 
onscreen or sliding keyboard. So don’t think you’re getting cheated when you 
don’t see the key you want.
Onscreen keyboard special characters
On the onscreen keyboard, you access special characters by pressing and 
holding a specific key. When you do, a pop-up palette of options appears, 
from which you choose a special character.
 
 To determine which keys on the onscreen keyboard sport extra characters, 
note the ellipsis that appear when you press the key, as shown in the margin. 
When you press and hold that key (a long-press), you see the pop-up palette 
of options, as shown in Figure 4-6. Choose the character you want from that 
palette or touch the X button to cancel.
Figure 4-6: Optional characters on the O key.
Extra characters are available in uppercase as well; press the Shift key before 
you long-press on the onscreen keyboard.
Certain symbol keys on the onscreen keyboard also sport extra characters. 
For example, various currency symbols are available when you long-press 
the $ key, and a host of emoticons are available on the Smile key.
Sliding keyboard special characters
Accessing special characters on the sliding keyboard is done by pressing Alt 
and the Space key, where you find the letters SYM shown in light-blue text. 
What you see is a pop-up palette of symbols that, yes, you have to choose by 
touching them on the Droid 2 screen. Figure 4-7 shows the available symbols.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
Figure 4-7: The SYM symbols on the sliding keyboard.
Despair not if you don’t see the symbol or character you’re looking for. Many 
more characters are available, but you have to know the press-and-hold trick 
on the sliding keyboard to see them.
To work the press-and-hold trick, press and hold the letter key that most 
resembles the symbol you want to type. For example, to type the ñ character, 
press and hold the N key. A palette of accented characters appears onscreen, 
from which you can choose ñ.
To produce a capital accented character, press the Shift key before you press 
and hold a letter key.
A palette of accented characters appears for most letter keys on the sliding 
keyboard; press and hold any key to see its palette onscreen. The vowel keys, 
specifically, have many characters available in their palettes.
Choosing a word as you type
As a “smart” phone, the Droid 2 makes a guess at the words you’re typing as 
you type them. A list of suggestions appears above the onscreen keyboard, 
or at the bottom of the touchscreen when you’re using the sliding keyboard. 
Choose a suggestion by touching it with your finger; the word instantly 
appears on the screen, saving you time (and potentially fixing your terrible 
spelling or typing, or both).
 
✓ One word guess appears highlighted in bold orange text. You can press 
the Space key to automatically choose that word.
 
✓ Though pressing the Space key to choose or correct a word is handy, 
it can also be the source of miscommunication when the phone 
guesses wrong.
 
✓ To fix an incorrectly chosen word, use the Del key to back up and erase. 
Type slower next time.
 
✓ You can disable the word suggestions and automatic error corrections.

 Chapter 4: Human-Droid Interaction
Take a Swype at the Old Hunt-and-Peck
The Swype typing utility is designed to drastically improve your typing speed 
on a touchscreen phone, such as the Droid 2. The Swype secret is that you 
can type without lifting your finger from the keyboard; you literally swipe 
your finger over the touchscreen to rapidly type words.
Though Swype is an amazing tool, it’s not for everyone. It appeals mostly to 
the younger crowd, which sends text messages like crazy. Still, Swype is a 
worthy alternative to using the normal onscreen keyboard, and it’s definitely 
faster than using the sliding keyboard.
 
✓ Though Swype may be fast, it’s not as fast as using dictation. See the 
later section “Voice Input.”
 
✓ Don’t confuse Swype with Skype, a utility you can use to place free 
phone calls and send instant text messages over the Internet.
Activating Swype
You can turn on Swype anytime you see the onscreen keyboard. Follow 
these steps:
 
 
1. Press and hold the ?123 button to summon the Multi-Touch 
Keyboard menu.
 
 Refer to Figure 4-1 for the key’s location.
 
2. Choose Input Method.
 
3. Choose Swype.
 
 You may be given the option to view a Swype tutorial; do so, if you’re 
prompted.
After switching to the Swype input method, you see a new keyboard, as 
shown in Figure 4-8. You’re now ready to start using Swype for typing text. 
Or, rather, for swyping text.
Even though Swype is active, you can continue to use your finger (or thumbs) 
to touch-type on the onscreen keyboard, and the sliding keyboard remains 
active as well. Oh, and dictation still works, as shown in Figure 4-8.
 
✓ To view the Swype tutorial, press the Swype button on the keyboard 
(refer to Figure 4-8) and then touch the Tutorial button.
 
✓ See the later section “Deactivating Swype” when you want to return to 
the standard Droid 2 onscreen keyboard.

Using Swype to create text
The key to using Swype is not to lift your finger from the keyboard. The 
secret to learning Swype is to start slowly; don’t worry that the teenager sit-
ting next to you is “swyping” so fast that it looks like he’s drawing Chinese 
characters on the phone.
Your first task in Swype is to learn how to type simple, short words: Keep 
your finger on the touchscreen and drag it over the letters in the word, such 
as the word howdy, shown in Figure 4-9. Lift your finger when you’ve com-
pleted the word, and the word appears in whichever app you’re using.

Capital letters are typed by dragging your finger above the keyboard after 
touching the letter, as shown in Figure 4-10 where Idaho was typed.
To produce a double letter, such as the oo in book, you add a little loop on 
that key. In Figure 4-11, the word Hello is typed, which uses both the capital-
letter trick and the double-letter trick.
When Swype is confused about the characters you’ve typed, a pop-up 
window appears with word suggestions, as shown in Figure 4-12.
Choose a suggestion from the list or switch to the alternative suggestions, as 
illustrated in Figure 4-12.

For more information on Swype typing tips, refer to the tutorial, found by 
touching the Swype button on the keyboard (refer to Figure 4-8).
 
✓ The Swype software interprets your intent as much as it does your 
accuracy. Even being close to the target letter is good enough; as long 
as you produce the pattern over the keyboard correctly, Swype usually 
displays the right word.
 
✓ Slow down and you’ll get the hang of it.
Deactivating Swype
To return to the normal, onscreen keyboard and disable Swype, follow 
these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Launcher button.
 
 Up pops the list of applications on your phone.
 
2. Choose the Settings icon.

5. Choose Multi-Touch Keyboard
 
 The onscreen keyboard is activated.
You can press the Home soft button to return to the Home screen when 
you’re done with the Language & Keyboard Settings window.
 
You can quickly switch keyboards by long-pressing any text field or area 
on the screen. From the menu that appears, choose Input Method and then 
choose the type of onscreen keyboard you want to use: Multi-Touch or 
Swype or whatever other options may appear.
Text Editing
I am but a fool to suggest that you’ll be editing much text on your cell phone. 
For most people, the cry is, “Damn the typos, full speed ahead!” If you decide 
to edit your text, though, this section is worthy of a read.
Moving the cursor
The first part of editing text is to move the cursor, that blinking vertical 
line where text appears, to the correct spot. You can move the cursor in 
two ways.
The first way to move the cursor is simply to touch the part of the text where 
you want the cursor to blink. This method works, but because your finger 
is probably fatter than the spot where you want the cursor, it’s not usually 
effective.
The second, and better, way to move the cursor is to use the direction keys, 
found on the sliding keyboard (refer to Figure 4-4). Pressing a direction key 
moves the cursor around the text in the direction of the arrow. It works just 
like pressing the arrow keys on a computer keyboard.
After you move the cursor, you can continue to type, use the Del key to back 
up and erase, or paste in text copied from elsewhere. See the later section 
“Cutting, copying, and pasting” for more information.
 
 
✓ When you touch the screen, you see a target icon appear in the text, as 
shown in the margin. That icon is used to help you select text, as cov-
ered in the following section.
 
✓ If you long-press on text, eventually you see a pop-up magnifying bubble, 
which you can use to carefully and precisely move the cursor.

68
Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
 
✓ I use a combination of finger and direction key to move the cursor: 
Touch the screen first with your finger. Then use a direction key to make 
fine adjustments.
Selecting text
You may be familiar with selecting text in a word processor; selecting text on 
the Droid 2 works the same way. Well, theoretically, it works the same way: 
Selected text appears highlighted on the touchscreen. You can then delete, 
cut, or copy that block of selected text. It’s the method of selecting text on a 
phone that’s different.
Your phone has several methods for selecting text, as covered in the follow-
ing sections.
After the text is selected, you can do four things with it: Delete it, replace it, 
copy it, or cut it. Delete the text by touching the Del key on the keyboard. 
Replace text by typing something new while the text is selected. The later sec-
tion “Cutting, copying, and pasting text” describes how to cut or copy text.
Text selection with the sliding keyboard
The easiest way to select text is to use the sliding keyboard. It works like this:
 
1. Extend the sliding keyboard.
 
2. Move the cursor to the location where you want to start selecting text.
 
 You can use your finger, and then make fine adjustments, by using the 
direction keys on the sliding keyboard.
 
3. Press and hold the Shift key.
 
4. Use the direction keys to extend the selection up, down, left, or right.
 
 The selected text appears highlighted on the screen.
Text selection with your finger on the touchscreen
To quickly select a word, tap your finger twice on the touchscreen. The word 
becomes highlighted on the screen.
Pay heed to the start block and end block markers on either side of the 
selected word; they look like vertical bars with a triangle on the top or 
bottom. You can use your finger to drag those start and end markers around 
the screen, which extends the text selection, as shown in Figure 4-13.

Select Text: Choose this option to select a block of text starting at the cursor 
location. The operation then proceeds as described in the earlier section 
“Text selection with your finger on the touchscreen.”
 
 To back out of the Edit Text menu, press the Back soft button.
You can cancel the selection of text by long-pressing the selected block and 
then choosing the Stop Selecting Text command from the menu that appears. 
See the later section “Cutting, copying, and pasting text.”
The option to add a word to the dictionary (refer to the bottom of Figure 4-14) 
appears only when you’re editing text from the onscreen keyboard.
Text selection on a Web page
When you’re browsing the Web on your Droid 2, you select text by summon-
ing a special menu item. Obey these steps:
 
 
1. Press the Menu soft button to summon the Web browser’s menu.
 
2. Choose the More command.
 
3. Choose Select Text.
 
4. Drag your finger over the text on the Web page you want to copy.
 
5. Lift your finger to complete selecting the text.
When you finish selecting, the text is instantly copied. You can then paste the 
text into any application on your phone that accepts text input. See the next 
section.
Refer to Chapter 11 for more information on surfing the Web with your phone.
Cutting, copying, and pasting text
After selecting a chunk of text — or all the text — on the screen, you can then 
cut or copy that text and paste it elsewhere. Copying or cutting and then 
pasting text works just like it does on your computer.
Follow these steps to cut or copy text on your phone:
 
1. Select the text you want to cut or copy.
 
 Selecting text is covered earlier in this chapter.
 
2. Long-press the selected text.
 
 Touch the text on the touchscreen and keep your finger pressed down. 
You see a variant of the Edit Text menu, similar to the one shown in 
Figure 4-15.

8. Choose the Paste command from the Edit Text menu (refer to 
Figure 4-15).
 
 The text you cut or copied appears in the spot where the cursor 
was blinking.
The text you paste can be pasted again and again. Until you cut or copy addi-
tional text, you can use the Paste command to your heart’s content.
 
✓ You can paste text only into locations where text is allowed. Odds are 
good that if you can type, or whenever you see the onscreen keyboard, 
you can paste text.
 
✓ When you initially select text, the menu that opens (refer to Figure 4-14) 
contains two commands you can use to select and cut or copy text: 
Choose Cut All to cut all text in a box or an area. Choose Copy All to 
copy all text. You can then use the Paste command, described in this 
section, to paste that chunk of text.

Part I: Droid 2: The Sequel 
Voice Input
One of the most amazing aspects of the Droid 2 is its uncanny ability to inter-
pret your dictation as text. It pays almost as much attention to what you say 
as your spouse does, though for legal reasons I can’t explain why that’s rel-
evant. Suffice it to say, diction is a boon to any cell phone user.
 
 
Voice input is available whenever you see the Microphone icon, similar to the 
one shown in the margin. To begin voice input, touch the icon. A voice input 
screen appears, as shown in Figure 4-16.
Figure 4-16: The voice input thing.
When you see the text Speak Now, speak directly into the phone.
As you speak, the Microphone icon (refer to Figure 4-16) flashes. The flashing 
doesn’t mean that the phone is embarrassed by what you’re saying. No, the 
flashing merely indicates that the phone is listening, detecting the volume of 
your voice.
After you stop talking, the phone digests what you said. You see your voice 
input appear as a wavelike pattern on the screen. Eventually, the text you 
spoke — or a close approximation of it — appears on the screen. It’s magical, 
and sometimes comical.
 
✓ The first time you try to use Voice Input, you might see a description 
displayed. Touch the OK button to continue.
 
✓ Also see Chapter 5 for information on dialing the phone by using 
your voice.
 
✓ A microphone key appears on both the onscreen and sliding keyboards, 
though the onscreen keyboard doesn’t always sport a microphone key.
 
✓ The Microphone icon appears only when voice input is allowed. Not 
every application features voice input as an option.
 
✓ The better your diction, the better the results. Try to speak only a sen-
tence or less.

 Chapter 4: Human-Droid Interaction
 
✓ You can edit your voice input just as you edit any text. See the section 
“Text Editing,” earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ You have to “speak” punctuation to include it in your text. For example, 
you say, “I’m sorry comma Belinda” to have the phone produce the text 
I’m sorry, Belinda (or similar wording.)
 
✓ Common punctuation marks that you can dictate include the comma, 
period, exclamation point, question mark, and colon.
 
✓ Pause your speech before and after speaking punctuation.
 
✓ Voice input may not function when no cellular data or Wi-Fi connection 
is available.
 
✓ The Droid 2 features a voice censor that replaces any naughty words 
you might utter with a series of pound (#) symbols. The phone knows a 
lot of blue terms, including the infamous “Seven Words You Can Never 
Say on Television,” but apparently the terms crap and damn are fine. 
Don’t ask me how much time I spent researching this topic.

In this part . . .
You remember going to the county fair? 
Remember the pitchmen? That was all part 
of the show. “It dices. It slices. It makes julienne 
fries!” Of course, the item they were huckstering 
cost twice as much as it did at the local store, and 
it broke after only a few uses. What’s the old 
phrase — “jack-of-all-trades, master of none.”
Your Droid 2 does a lot of useful things, and it 
handles them quite well for a jack-of-all-trades: 
photographs, videos, music, maps, email, and the 
Web. But at its core, your Droid 2 remains a 
phone. Its primary purpose, its raison d’être, is to 
make phone calls. That basic function is covered 
in this part of the book.

▶ Trying out voice dialing
▶ Getting a call
▶ Checking into a missed call
▶ Perusing the Recent call list
I
bought my first cell phone in 1993. It was a Motorola MicroTAC. I paid 
$600 for it. My cellular plan was horrendously expensive — something like 
$1.20 per minute for all calls. The sad part was that I didn’t even receive a 
signal at my house. Still, I was mobile and the phone looked cool in 
its bulky pouch on my belt.
Technology has leapt forward greatly since 1993. 
Despite all the bells and whistles on the Droid 2, its 
main function is making and receiving phone calls. It 
does that quite well, and much better (not to men-
tion cheaper) than the old MicroTAC.
Reach Out and Touch Someone
It’s the next best thing to being there, especially 
when your Uncle Roger is a fisherman and you detest 
the smell of bait. Oh, but it’s good to hear his voice. 
Making that connection is simple on the Droid 2, especially 
after reviewing the information in this section.

Making a phone call
To place a call on your phone, heed these steps:
 
1. Touch the phone icon, found on the Home screen.
 
 You see the Phone dialpad, similar to the one shown in Figure 5-1. If not, 
touch the Dialer tab, as indicated in the figure.

2. Input the number to call.
 
 Touch the keys on the dialpad to input the number. If you make a mis-
take, use the Delete key, shown in Figure 5-1, to back up and erase.
 
 As you dial, you may hear the traditional touch-tone sound as you input 
the number. The phone may also vibrate as you touch the numbers. 
These sound and vibration settings can be changed; see Chapter 22.

3. Touch the green phone button to make the call.
 
 The phone doesn’t make the call until you touch the green button.
 
 As the phone attempts to make the connection, two things happen:
 
 
• First, the Call in Progress notification icon appears on the status 
bar. The icon is a big clue that the phone is making a call or is 
actively connected.
 
• Second, the screen changes to show the number you dialed, 
similar to the one shown in Figure 5-2. When the recipient is in 
your Contacts list, the name also appears, as shown in the figure. 
Further, if a picture is part of the person’s contact information, the 
picture appears when the person answers the phone, as shown in 
Figure 5-2.

Part II: Phone 101 
 
 Even though the touchscreen is pretty, at this point you need to listen 
to the phone: Put it up to your ear or listen through the earphones or a 
Bluetooth headset.
 
4. When the person answers the phone, talk.
 
 What you say is up to you, though I can recommend from experience 
that it’s a bad idea to open your conversation with your girlfriend about 
the great dream you had about her last night until you’re assured that 
you’re talking with your girlfriend and not her mother.
 
 Use the phone’s Volume button (on the side of the Droid 2) to adjust the 
speaker volume during the call.
 
5. To end the call, touch the red End Call button.
 
 The phone disconnects. You hear a soft beep, which is the phone’s signal 
that the call has ended. The Call in Progress notification goes away.
 
 You can do other things while you’re making a call on the Droid 2. Just press 
the Home button to run an application, read old email, check an appoint-
ment, or do whatever. Such activities don’t disconnect you, though your 
cellular carrier may not allow you to do other things with the phone while 
you’re on a call.
You can also listen to music while you’re making a call, though I don’t recom-
mend it, because the music volume and call volume cannot be set separately.
To return to a call after doing something else, swipe down the notifications 
at the top of the screen and touch the notification for the current call. You 
return to the Connected screen, similar to the one shown in Figure 5-2. 
Continue yapping. (See Chapter 3 for information on reviewing notifications.)
 
✓ You can connect or remove the earphones at any time during a call. The 
call is neither disconnected nor interrupted by doing so.
 
✓ If you’re using earphones, you can press the phone’s Power button 
during the call to turn off the display and lock the phone. I recommend 
turning off the display so that you don’t accidentally touch the Mute or 
End button during the call.
 
✓ You can’t accidentally mute or end a call when the phone is placed 
against your face; a sensor in the phone detects when it’s close to some-
thing and the touchscreen is automatically disabled.
 
✓ Don’t worry about the phone being too far away from your mouth; it 
picks up your voice just fine.
 
 
✓ To mute a call, touch the Mute button, shown in Figure 5-2. A Mute 
icon, shown in the margin, appears as the phone’s status (atop the 
touchscreen).

 Chapter 5: Yes, It’s a Telephone
 
 
✓ Touch the Speaker button to be able to hold the phone at a distance to 
listen and talk, which allows you to let others listen and share in the 
conversation. The Speaker icon appears as the phone’s status when the 
speaker is active.
 
✓ If you’re wading through one of those nasty voicemail systems, touch 
the Dialpad button, shown in Figure 5-2, so that you can “Press 1 for 
English” when necessary.
 
✓ Don’t hold the phone to your ear when the speaker is active.
 
✓ See Chapter 6 for information on using the Add Call button.
 
✓ When using a Bluetooth headset, connect the headset before you make 
the call.
 
✓ If you need to dial an international number, press and hold the 0 (zero) 
key until the plus-sign (+) character appears. Then input the rest of 
the international number. Refer to Chapter 21 for more information on 
making international calls.
 
✓ You hear an audio alert when the call is dropped or the other party 
hangs up on you. The disconnection can be confirmed by looking at the 
phone, which shows that the call has ended.
 
✓ You cannot place a phone call when the phone has no service; check 
the signal strength, as shown in Figure 5-1. Also see the nearby sidebar, 
“Signal strength and network information you don’t have to read.”
 
✓ You cannot place a phone call when the phone is in Airplane mode. See 
Chapter 21 for information.
 
✓ The Call in Progress notification icon (see Figure 5-2) is a useful thing. 
When you see this notification, it means that the phone is connected to 
another party. To return to the phone screen, swipe down the status bar 
and touch the phone call’s notification. You can then press the End Call 
button to disconnect or just put the phone to your face to see who’s on 
the line.
 
✓ You cannot, using current technology, browse the Internet or receive 
email (or other data) while you’re making a call on the Droid 2. Future 
changes in technology or the cell network may change that condition.
Dialing a contact
Because your Droid 2 is also your digital Little Black Book, one of the easiest 
methods for placing a phone call is to simply dial one of the folks on your 
Contacts list. You have several ways to do it.

Part II: Phone 101 
Choosing a contact from the Contacts list
To phone up someone on your phone’s Contacts list, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Home screen, touch the Contacts icon.
 
 The icon appears in the lower right corner, next to the Launcher button, 
on the Home screen. After touching the icon, you see a list of contacts. 
Unless you’ve messed with the Contacts list, it’s sorted alphabetically 
by first name, similar to the one shown in Figure 5-3.
 
2. Scroll the list of contacts to find the person you want to call.
 
 To rapidly scroll, you can swipe the list with your finger or use the tab 
that appears on the right side of the list, as shown in Figure 5-3; drag the 
tab around using your finger.
Signal strength and network information 
you don’t have to read
Two technical-looking status icons appear 
to the left of the current time atop the Droid 2 
screen. These icons represent the network the 
phone is connected to and the signal strength.
The Signal Strength icon displays the familiar 
bars, rising from left to right. The more bars you 
see, the better the signal. An extremely low 
signal is shown by zero bars; when there’s no 
signal, you see an X over the bars.
When the phone is out of its service area but 
still receiving a signal, you see the Roaming 
icon, where an R appears near the bars. See 
Chapter 21 for more information on roaming.
To the left of the signal bar icon is the Network 
icon. No icon means that no network is avail-
able, which happens when the network is down 
or you’re out of range. The icon might also dis-
appear when you’re making a call. Otherwise, 
you see an icon representing one of the differ-
ent types of cellular data networks to which the 
Droid 2 can connect:
 ✓ The GPRS icon appears whenever the 
Droid 2 is connected to a 2G network using 
the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) 
protocol.
 ✓ The EDGE icon shows up when the Droid 
2 is connected to the EDGE 2G digital net-
work. EDGE stands for Enhanced Data 
Rates for GSM Evolution, just in case you 
do crossword puzzles.
 ✓ The 3G icon appears when the Droid 2 is 
connected to a 3G network. (Figure 5-1 has 
the 3G icon on display.)
The Network icon animates whenever a signal 
is being transmitted.
Also see Chapter 14 for more information on the 
network connection and how it plays a role in 
your phone’s Internet access.

Using a Contact Quick Task widget on the Home screen
The Droid 2 Home screen comes preconfigured with Contact Quick Task wid-
gets. They’re found on the first Home screen to the right of the main Home 
screen, and they’re blank until you assign contacts to them.
After assigning a contact to a quick task widget, you can touch that quick task 
widget to instantly dial the contact. More information on how the Contact 
Quick Task widget is set up can be found in Chapter 8. See Chapter 22 for 
more information about widgets on the Home screen.
Phoning someone you call often
Because the Droid 2 is sort of a computer, it keeps track of your phone calls. 
Also, you can flag as favorites certain people whose numbers you want to 
keep handy. You can take advantage of these two features to quickly call the 
people you phone most often or to redial a number.
To use the call log to return a call, or to call someone right back, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Touch the Phone icon on the Home screen.
 
2. Touch the Recent tab.
 
 The tab is found at the top of the screen, to the right of the Dialer tab.
 
 The Recent tab displays a list of calls you’ve made and calls received. 
Though you can choose an item to see more information, to call some-
one back, it’s just quicker to follow Step 3:
 
3. Touch the green Phone icon next to the entry.
 
 The Droid 2 dials the contact.

 Chapter 5: Yes, It’s a Telephone
People you call frequently, or contacts you’ve added to the favorites list, can 
be accessed by heeding these directions:
 
1. Touch the Phone icon on the Home screen.
 
2. Touch the Favorites tab.
 
 The tab is found at the top of the screen, to the far right.
 
 The top part of the list contains favorites, contacts you’ve marked with a 
star. Below that you see a list of frequently called names and numbers.
 
3. Scroll the list to find a contact.
 
4. Touch the contact to see that person’s information, or touch the green 
Phone button to call the contact.
Refer to Chapter 8 for information on how to make one of your contacts 
a favorite.
Using the Voice Dialer
The Droid 2 understands your speech, which means that you can not only 
dictate to the phone but also dial the phone using your voice and not your 
finger.
The quick-and-dirty way to dial the phone with your voice is to follow 
these steps:
 
 
1. Press and hold the Search soft button.
 
 You see the Microphone icon and the text Speak Now.
 
 When you first try this trick, you may see an introduction screen; touch 
the Speak Now button.
 
2. Say the word call followed by the contact’s name, or you can speak 
the phone number.
Where is that call coming from?
The Droid 2 displays the caller’s location for 
both incoming and outgoing calls, similar to the 
ones shown in Figures 5-2 and 5-5. This feature 
happens courtesy of the City ID app.
City ID is a subscription service, though you can 
try the free 15-day trial on your Droid 2. After 
that, you have to sign up to pay for the service. 
Though this tool may not help you identify call-
ers you know, it’s handy for gleaning informa-
tion about unknown incoming calls.
Open the City ID app in the Applications Tray to 
find more information about City ID.

Part II: Phone 101 
When the contact name is recognized, the number is dialed immediately. 
Otherwise, you see a list of names to choose from — though that’s not really 
in the spirit of voice dialing.
 
✓ You can quickly access the Droid 2 voice dialer function by touching the 
Voice Dial button, found on the Dialer screen (refer to Figure 5-1).
 
✓ Be precise! If the contact is named William Johnson, the Droid 2 may not 
dial it when you say “Bill Johnson.”
 
✓ You have to be pretty dang fast to touch that Cancel button if the phone 
chooses the wrong contact to dial. Don’t try this trick unless you can see 
the phone to confirm that it’s dialing the proper number.
 
✓ The number dialed is the main, or default, number that’s set up when 
you add the contact. See Chapter 8 for information on how to set the 
main number for a contact.
 
✓ See Chapter 4 for additional information on using the Droid 2 voice 
input ability.
Someone’s Calling!
I believe that everyone enjoys getting a phone call. It’s with a swift, confi-
dent motion that you reach for your cell phone, whipping it out to check the 
screen to see who’s calling. Then comes either disgust as the call is banished 
to voicemail or feigned innocence as you mutter, “Hello,” even though Caller 
ID has already clued you in to who’s calling. Oh, I love the drama!
Receiving a call
Several things can happen when you receive a phone call on your Droid 2:
 
✓ The phone rings or makes a noise signaling you to an incoming call.
 
✓ The phone vibrates.
 
✓ The touchscreen reveals information about the call, as shown in Figure 5-5.
 
✓ The car in front of you explodes and your crazy passenger starts 
screaming in an incoherent yet comic manner.
The last item happens only in a Bruce Willis movie. The other three possibili-
ties, or a combination thereof, are your signals that you have an incoming 
call. A simple look at the touchscreen tells you more information, as illus-
trated in Figure 5-5.
Figure 5-5 shows what an incoming call looks like when the Droid 2 is locked. 
If such is in fact the case, slide the green button to the right, which answers 
the phone.

After answering the call, place the phone to your ear or use the headset, if 
one is attached.
 
To ignore the call, slide the red Decline button to the left (refer to Figure 5-5) 
or, if you’re using the phone, touch the red Ignore button. The phone stops 
ringing and the call is immediately sent to voicemail.
You can also touch the Volume (Up or Down) button to silence the ringer.
 
✓ The contact picture, such as Mr. Poe in Figure 5-5, appears only when 
you’ve assigned a picture to that contact. Otherwise, the generic 
Android icon shows up.
 
✓ See Chapter 6 for information on how to deal with an incoming call when 
you’re already on the phone.

✓ If you’re using a Bluetooth headset, you touch the control on the head-
set to answer your phone. See Chapter 14 for more information on using 
Bluetooth gizmos.
 
✓ The sound you hear when the phone rings is known as the ringtone. You 
can configure the Droid 2 to play a number of ringtones, depending on 
who is calling, or you can set a universal ringtone. Ringtones are cov-
ered in Chapter 6.
Setting incoming call signals
Whether the phone rings, vibrates, or explodes depends on how you’ve con-
figured the Droid 2 to signal you for an incoming call. Abide by these steps to 
set the various options (but not explosions) for your phone:
 
1. On the Home screen, touch the Launcher button to view all apps on 
the phone.
 
2. Choose the Settings icon to open the phone’s Settings screen.
 
3. Choose Sound.
 
4. Set the phone’s ringer volume by touching Volume.
 
5. Manipulate the Ringtone slider left or right to specify how loud the 
phone rings for an incoming call.
 
 After you release the slider, you hear an example of how loudly the 
phone rings.
 
6. Touch OK to set the ringer volume.
 
 If you’d rather just mute the phone, touch the Silent Mode option on the 
main Sound Settings screen.
 
7. To activate vibration when the phone rings, touch Vibrate.
 
8. Choose a vibration option from the Vibrate menu.
 
 For example, choose Always to always vibrate the phone or Only in 
Silent Mode so that the phone vibrates only when you’ve muted the 
volume.
 
9. Touch the Home button when you’re done.
When the next call comes in, the phone alerts you using the volume setting 
or vibration options you’ve just set.
 
✓ See Chapter 3 for information on temporarily silencing the phone.
 
✓ Turning on vibration puts an extra drain on the battery. See Chapter 22 
for more information on power management for your phone.
 
✓ Also refer to Chapter 22 for additional sound options on the Droid 2.

 Chapter 5: Yes, It’s a Telephone
Who’s Calling Who When?
Life got easier in my household when I got my Droid 2. Before the Droid 2, 
my son was the one who answered the old landline phone. He was terrible at 
remembering who phoned and when they called, let alone what message was 
left. With the Droid 2, however, I can instantly and boldly confirm who called, 
and when they called, and then call that person right back. Yes, indeed — 
another gizmo that the Droid 2 renders unnecessary is the common house-
hold teenager.
Dealing with a missed call
 
 The notification icon for a missed call looming at the top of the screen means 
that someone called and you didn’t pick up. Fortunately, the Droid 2 remem-
bers all the details for you.
To deal with a missed call, follow these steps:
 
1. Display the notifications.
 
 See Chapter 3 for details on how to deal with notifications.
 
2. Touch the Missed Call notification.
 
 A list of missed calls is displayed. The list shows who called, with more 
information displayed when the phone number matches someone in 
your Contacts list. Also shown is the time they called.
 
3. Touch the green Phone icon by an entry in the call log to return 
the call.
Also see the next section for more information on the call log.
Reviewing recent calls
The Droid 2 keeps a record of all calls you make, incoming calls, and missed 
calls. Everything is listed on the Recent tab, shown in Figure 5-6. To see that 
list, touch the Phone icon on the Home screen and then choose the Recent 
tab, as shown in the figure.
The Recent tab shows a list of people who have phoned you or whom you 
have called, starting with the most recent call at the top of the list. An icon 
next to each entry describes whether the call was incoming, outgoing, or 
missed, as illustrated in the figure.
Touching an item in the call log displays contact information for the person 
who called, if that contact information exists. When contact information 
doesn’t exist, you see a pop-up menu of options for returning the call, send-
ing a text message, and so on.

O
riginally, Alexander Graham Bell hired teenage boys to be 
phone operators. They proved unreliable. The boys 
were replaced by young women. Eventually, they too were 
replaced, when telephones came supplied with dials. 
That way, everyone became their own phone opera-
tor. It wasn’t a hefty chore to dial a phone, mostly 
because the dial had no Enter key, but also because 
all the old telephone did was send and receive calls. 
Things are different today.
Your phone does more than make phone calls, of 
course. Still, it can likely do more with the basic 
phone call than any other phone you’ve owned. 
Most people don’t bother with extra phone features. 
You can ignore the features as well, or you can choose 
to read this chapter and discover what your Droid 2 can 
do beyond the basic phone stuff.

Speed Dial
How fast can you dial a phone? Pretty fast — specifically, for ten of the 
friends or folks you phone most often. The feature is speed dial. To set it up 
on your Droid 2, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Phone button.
 
 The Phone button is found to the left of the Launcher, at the bottom of 
the Home screen, or on the left of the Home screen when the sliding key-
board is extended.
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose Speed Dial Setup.
 
 The first speed-dial number is already configured to your carrier’s voice-
mail system. The remaining numbers, 2 through 9, are blank.
 
4. Touch a blank item in the list.
 
 The blank lines contain the text Add Speed Dial. To the left of the blank 
item is the speed dial number, 2 through 9.
 
5. Choose a contact to speed-dial.
 
6. When a contact has multiple phone numbers, you see a menu from 
which you can choose the specific phone number to speed-dial.
 
7. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to add more speed-dial numbers.
When you’re done adding numbers, press the Back or Home button to exit 
the Speed Dial Setup screen.
Using speed dial is simple: Summon the phone dialer (refer to Figure 5-1, in 
Chapter 5), and then press and hold (long-touch) a number on the dialpad. 
When you release your finger, the speed-dial number is dialed.
To remove a speed-dial number, follow Steps 1 through 3 in this section. 
Touch the minus (–) button to the left of the speed-dial number to remove 
the number. You can then add another speed-dial number in that slot or just 
leave it empty.
To add a recent caller to the speed-dial list, long-press the recent caller from 
the Recent call log. Choose the option Add to Speed Dial from the menu that 
appears. This trick works only when you have an available slot for speed-dial 
numbers. See Chapter 5 for more information on the Recent call log.

 Chapter 6: Beyond the Basic Phone Stuff
Multiple Call Mania
A human being can hold only one conversation at a time. I remember hear-
ing that theory in a lecture, but then the guy next to me started talking and I 
couldn’t focus on what the speaker was saying. So I’ll never know for certain. 
I do, however, know that the Droid 2 is capable of handling more than one 
call at a time. This section explains how it works.
Receiving a new call when you’re on the phone
You’re on the phone, chatting it up. Suddenly, someone else calls you. What 
happens next?
The Droid 2 alerts you to a new call. The phone may vibrate or make a sound. 
Look at the front of the phone to see what’s up with the incoming call, as 
shown in Figure 6-1.
A phone call is in progress

Part II: Phone 101 
You have three options:
Answer the call. Touch the green Answer button to answer the incoming call. 
The call you’re on is placed on hold.
Send the call directly to voicemail. Touch the Ignore button. The incoming 
call is sent directly to voicemail.
Ignore the call. Do nothing. The call eventually goes into voicemail.
When you choose to answer the call and the call you’re on is placed on hold, 
you return to the first call when you end the second call. Or, you can manage 
the multiple calls as described in the next section.
Juggling two calls
After you answer a second call, as described in the preceding section, your 
Droid 2 is now working with two calls at a time. In this particular situation, 
you can speak with only one person at a time; juggling two calls is not the 
same thing as a conference call.
To switch between callers, touch the green Switch Calls button that appears 
on the touchscreen. Every time you touch the Switch Calls button, the con-
versation moves to the other caller.
To end a call, touch the End Call button, just as you normally would. Both 
calls might appear to have been disconnected, but that’s not the case: In a 
few moments, the call you didn’t disconnect “rings” as though the person 
called you back. They didn’t call you back, though: The Droid 2 is simply 
returning you to that ongoing conversation.
 
✓ The number of different calls your phone can handle depends on your 
carrier. For most of us, that’s only two calls at a time. In that case, a 
third person who calls you either hears a busy signal or is sent right into 
voicemail.
 
✓ Put the phone where you can see the touchscreen when you work with 
multiple calls. That way, you can see who’s on the line, who is waiting, 
and how long they’ve been waiting.
 
✓ If the person on hold hangs up, you may hear a sound or feel the phone 
vibrate when the call is dropped.
Making a conference call
Unlike someone interrupting a conversation with an incoming call, a confer-
ence call is something you set out to do intentionally: You make one call and 
then add a second call. Touch a button on the Droid 2 touchscreen and then 
everyone is talking. Here’s how it works:
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
95
 Chapter 6: Beyond the Basic Phone Stuff
 
1. Phone the first person.
 
 Refer to Chapter 5 if you need to bone up on your Droid 2 phone-
calling skills.
 
2. After your phone connects and you complete a few pleasantries, touch 
the Add Call button.
 
 The first person is put on hold.
 
3. Dial the second person.
 
 You can use the dialpad or choose the second person from your 
Contacts list or Recent call log.
 
 Say your pleasantries and inform the party that the call is about to 
be merged.
 
4. Touch the Merge Calls button.
 
 The two calls are now joined: The touchscreen says Conference Call, and 
the End Last Call button appears. Everyone you’ve dialed can talk to and 
hear each other.
 
5. Touch the End Call button to end the conference call.
 
 All calls are disconnected.
 
When several people are in a room and want to participate in a call, you can 
always put the phone in Speaker mode: Touch the Speaker button.
Send a Call Elsewhere
Banishing an unwanted call on the Droid 2 is relatively easy. You can dismiss 
the phone from ringing by touching the Volume button. Or, you can send the 
call scurrying off into voicemail by sliding the red Ignore button to the left, as 
described in the section in Chapter 5 about receiving a call.
Other options exist for the special handling of incoming calls. They’re the for-
warding options, described in this section.
Forwarding phone calls
Call-forwarding is the process by which you take a phone call coming into 
your Droid 2 and send it elsewhere. For example, you can send all calls you 
receive to your office when you’re on vacation. Then you have the luxury of 
having your cell phone and still making calls but freely ignoring anyone who 
calls you.

96
Part II: Phone 101 
The options for call forwarding on the Droid 2 are set by the cell phone car-
rier, and not by the phone itself. In the United States, using Verizon as your 
cellular provider, the call forwarding options work as described in Table 6-1.
Table 6-1 
Verizon Call Forwarding Commands
To Do This
Input First Number
Input Second Number
Forward unanswered 
incoming calls
*71
Forwarding number
Forward all incoming calls
*72
Forwarding number
Cancel call forwarding
*73
None
For example, to forward all calls to (714) 555-4565, you input *727145554565 
and touch the green Dial button on the Droid 2. You hear just a brief tone 
after dialing, and then the call ends. After that, any call coming into your 
phone rings at the other number.
 
✓ You must disable call forwarding on your Droid 2 to return to normal 
cell phone operations. Dial *73.
 
✓ The Droid 2 doesn’t even ring when you forward a call using *72. Only 
the phone number you’ve chosen to forward to rings.
 
✓ You don’t need to input the area code for the forwarding number when 
it’s a local call. In other words, if you only need to dial 555-4565 to call 
the forwarding number, you need to input only *725554565 to forward 
your calls.
 
✓ The Android operating system has forwarding features that are unavail-
able on the Droid 2, though they might be made available in the future. 
If so, you can find them on the Settings screen: Choose Call Settings, and 
then choose Call Forwarding.
Sending a contact directly to voicemail
You can configure the Droid 2 to forward any of your cell phone contacts 
directly to voicemail. This is a great way to deal with a pest! Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Touch the Contacts icon on the Home screen.
 
 The Contacts list opens.
 
2. Choose a contact.
 
 Use your finger to scroll the list of contacts until you find the annoying 
person you want to eternally banish to voicemail.

3. Touch the Menu soft button.
 
 
4. Choose Edit.
 
5. Choose Additional Info.
 
 You may need to scroll to the bottom of the Edit Contact screen to find 
the Additional Info bar. When you do, touch the Triangle button on the 
right end of the bar to display the additional information.
 
6. Touch the square next to the Send Straight to Voicemail? option.
 
 A green check mark appears in the square, indicating that all calls from 
the contact (no matter which of their phone numbers they use) are sent 
directly into voicemail.
 
7. Touch the Save button.
To unbanish the contact, repeat these steps but in Step 6 touch the square to 
remove the green check mark.
 
✓ This feature is one reason why you might want to retain contact infor-
mation for someone with whom you never want to have contact.
 
✓ See Chapter 8 for more information on contacts.
 
✓ Also see Chapter 7, on voicemail.
Fun with Ringtones
I confess: Ringtones can be lots of fun. They uniquely identify your phone’s 
ring, especially when you forget to mute your phone and you’re hustling to 
turn the thing off because everyone in the room is annoyed by your ringtone 
choice of It’s a Small World.
On the Droid 2, you can choose which ringtone you want for your phone. You 
can create your own ringtones or use snippets from your favorite tunes. You 
can also assign ringtones for individual contacts. This section explains how 
it’s done.
Choosing the phone’s ringtone
To select a new ringtone for your phone, or to simply confirm which ringtone 
you’re using already, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Launcher button.
 
2. Choose Settings.
 
3. Choose Sound.
 
4. Choose Phone Ringtone.

Part II: Phone 101 
 
 If you have a ringtone application, you may see a menu that asks you 
which source to use for the phone’s ringtone. Choose Android System.
 
5. Choose a ringtone from the list that’s displayed.
 
 Scroll the list. Tap a ringtone to hear a preview.
 
6. Touch OK to accept the new ringtone or touch Cancel to keep the 
phone’s ringtone as is.
You can also set the ringtone used for notifications: In Step 4, choose 
Notification Ringtone instead of Phone Ringtone.
Setting a contact’s ringtone
Ringtones can be assigned by contact so that when your annoying friend 
Larry calls, you can have your phone yelp like a whiny puppy. Here’s how to 
set a ringtone for a contact:
 
1. Touch the Contacts icon on the Home screen.
 
2. From the list, choose the contact to which you want to assign 
a ringtone.
 
3. Touch the Menu soft button.
 
4. Choose Edit.
 
5. Touch the Triangle button on the Additional Info bar to display 
more options.
 
6. Scroll down and press the Triangle button by Call Handling.
 
7. Choose a ringtone from the list.
 
 It’s the same list that’s displayed for the phone’s ringtones.
 
8. Touch OK to assign the ringtone to that contact.
 
9. Touch the Save button to confirm your choice.
Whenever that contact calls, the Droid 2 rings using the ringtone you’ve 
specified.
To remove a specific ringtone for a contact, repeat the steps in this section 
but choose the ringtone named Default Ringtone. That option sets the con-
tact’s ringtone to be the same as the phone’s ringtone.
Using music as a ringtone
You can use any tune from the Droid 2 music library as the phone’s ringtone. 
The first part of the process is finding a good tune to use. Follow along with 
these steps:
www.it-ebooks.info

 Chapter 6: Beyond the Basic Phone Stuff
 
1. Touch the Applications button on the Home screen to display all apps 
on the phone.
 
2. Touch Music to open the music player.
 
3. Choose a tune to play.
 
 See Chapter 18 for specific information on how to use the Music applica-
tion and use your Droid 2 as a portable music player.
 
 The song you want must either appear on the screen or be playing for 
you to select it as a ringtone.
 
4. Press the Menu soft button.
 
5. Choose Use As Ringtone.
 
 The song — the entire thing — is set as the phone’s ringtone. Whenever 
you receive a call, that song plays.
The song you’ve chosen is added to the list of ringtones. It plays — from the 
start of the song — when you have an incoming call and until you answer the 
phone, send the call to voicemail, or choose to ignore the call and eventually 
the caller goes away and the music stops.
You can add as many songs as you like by repeating the steps in this section. 
Follow the steps in the earlier section “Choosing the phone’s ringtone” for 
information on switching between different song ringtones. Refer to the steps 
in the earlier section “Setting a contact’s ringtone” to assign a specific song 
to a contact.
 
 A free app at the Android Market, Zedge, has oodles of free ringtones avail-
able for preview and download, all shared by Android users around the 
world. See Chapter 20 for information about the Android Market and how to 
download and install apps such as Zedge on your phone.
Creating your own ringtones
 
You can use any MP3 or WAV audio file as a ringtone for the Droid 2, such as 
a personalized message, a sound you record on your computer, or an audio 
file you stole from the Internet. As long as the sound is in the MP3 or WAV 
format, it can work as a ringtone on your phone.
The secret to creating your own ringtone is to transfer the audio file from 
your computer to the Droid 2. That topic is covered in Chapter 13, on syn-
chronizing music between your computer and phone. After the audio file is in 
the phone’s music library, you can choose the file as a ringtone in the same 
way you can assign any music on the Droid 2 as a ringtone, as described in 
the preceding section.

oicemail can prove to be handy in so many ways. First, and most obvi-
ously, voicemail exists for missed phone calls. When you’re not avail-
able or you’re on the other line, someone can leave you a message. Second, 
voicemail exists as a sort of digital hell to whence you can banish unwanted 
calls from annoying pests. Finally, voicemail exists as an excuse: You can dis-
miss anyone by simply claiming that you’ve yet to check your voicemail for 
messages. If only our ancestors had it so good.
Carrier Voicemail
The most basic, and most stupid, form of voicemail 
is the free voicemail service provided by your cell 
phone company. It’s a standard feature with few 
frills and nothing that stands out differently, espe-
cially for such a nifty phone as the Droid 2.
 
 Carrier voicemail picks up missed calls and calls 
you thrust into voicemail. The Droid 2 alerts you to a 
missed call by displaying the Missed Call notification 
(shown in the margin). You then dial the voicemail 
system, listen to your calls, and use the phone’s dialpad to 
delete messages or repeat messages or use other features you 
probably don’t know about because no one ever pays attention.

✓ The Missed Call icon does not appear when you’ve sent a call to voicemail.
 
✓ The meat of voicemail on the Droid 2 is Visual Voice Mail, covered later 
in this chapter. Even so, this section covers the basic instructions for 
using generic carrier voicemail, which you must configure before you 
can use Visual Voice Mail.
Setting up carrier voicemail
If you haven’t yet done it, you need to set up voicemail on your phone. Even 
if you believe it to be set up and configured, consider churning through these 
steps, just to be sure:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu soft button.
 
 
2. Choose Settings.
 
 The Settings screen appears.
 
3. Choose Call Settings.
 
4. Choose Voicemail Service.
 
5. Choose My Carrier, if it isn’t chosen already.
 
 When My Carrier is already chosen, the phone is configured to use 
your cell service provider’s voicemail service. You’re done. Otherwise, 
continue:
 
6. Back on the Call Settings screen, choose Voicemail Settings.
 
 The number that’s shown should be the one for your carrier’s voicemail 
service. For example, on Verizon in the United States, the number is *86. 
If you need to change the number, read the next section.
 
Phone your carrier voicemail after the initial setup, which completes the con-
figuration. On my carrier (Verizon), I configured my language, set a voicemail 
password, and then recorded a greeting, following the steps offered by the 
cheerful Verizon robot. Complete those steps even if you plan to use Visual 
Voice Mail, covered later in this chapter.
 
Don’t forget to complete your voice mailbox setup by creating a customized 
greeting. When you don’t, you may not receive voicemail messages, or people 
may believe that they’ve dialed the wrong number.
Changing the carrier voicemail number
When you need to change your voicemail number, follow Steps 1 through 3 
in the preceding section and choose Voicemail Settings. If necessary, choose 
the Voicemail Number option. Type the proper voicemail number, as shown 
in Figure 7-1.

If you touch the Contact icon, shown in Figure 7-1, you see the Droid 2 
Contacts list, from which you can pluck a contact to use for voicemail. That 
option is intended for special voicemail services, such as Google Voice, 
which you can choose for the Droid 2. I recommend not using Aunt Linda’s 
cell phone number as your voicemail service.
Getting your messages
To access carrier voicemail on the Droid 2, you manually dial into the voice-
mail service. For Verizon in the United States, it’s *86. Or, if you haven’t yet 
set up Visual Voicemail, you can open the Voicemail app and touch the Call 
Voicemail button.
What happens after the voicemail system is dialed depends on your carrier. 
I’m using Verizon in the United States, so I have to input my password and 
press the # key. Then any new messages are automatically played.

✓ The easiest way to start the Voicemail app is to touch the Voicemail 
button, found on the dialpad window. (Refer to Figure 5-1, in Chapter 5.)
 
✓ You don’t have to venture into carrier voicemail just to see who called 
you. Instead, check the call log to review recent calls. Refer to Chapter 5 
for information on reviewing the call log.
 
✓ Calls you exile into voicemail are not flagged as Missed in the Recent 
call log.
 
✓ See Chapter 3 for more information on reviewing notifications.
Visual Voice Mail
A better option than carrier voicemail is to set up and use Visual Voice Mail. 
Visual Voice Mail is simply an interface into your existing carrier voicemail. 
This feature on the Droid 2 provides more flexibility when dealing with 
boring, old carrier voicemail. For example, using Visual Voice Mail, you can 
choose which messages to listen to and pause or replace messages.
The only drawback to using Visual Voice Mail is that it costs extra. You 
must subscribe to the service, which runs $2.99 per month as this book goes 
to press.

 Chapter 7: At the Sound of the Tone . . .
Setting up Visual Voice Mail
To configure Visual Voice Mail to work on your Droid 2, first set up carrier 
voicemail as covered earlier in this chapter.
After you get carrier voicemail up and running, and especially after you set 
your password or PIN, follow these steps:
 
1. Touch the Launcher button to pop up the list of all apps installed on 
your phone.
 
2. Choose the Voicemail app.
 
 A shortcut to the Voicemail app is also found on the main Home screen.
 
3. Touch the Subscribe to Visual Voice Mail button.
 
4. Touch the Accept button after you’ve ignored the end user license 
agreement.
 
5. Type your current voicemail password into the text box.
 
 See? That’s why I recommend that you set up carrier voicemail first.
 
6. Touch the Login button.
 
 And you’re done. The Visual Voice Mail inbox appears on the screen, 
listing any lingering messages in your voicemail inbox.
Your Voicemail app may need upgrading before you can access Visual 
Voice Mail. If so, touch the Upgrade button and use the Android Market app 
to upgrade and install the Visual Voice Mail program. After the program 
upgrade is installed, run the Visual Voice Mail app and follow the directions 
on the touchscreen to set things up.
Refer to Chapter 20 for more information on using the Android Market to 
install new applications on your Droid 2.
Accessing Visual Voice Mail
Visual Voice Mail serves as your access to all voicemail left on your phone. 
After Visual Voice Mail is configured (see the preceding section), you never 
need to dial carrier voicemail again. Simply pull down a Visual Voice Mail 
notification or start the Voicemail app, and all your messages are instantly 
available on the screen.
 
 When new voicemail arrives, you see a notification icon, as shown in the 
margin. To access your message, pull down the notifications and choose 
New Voicemail. You see your voicemail inbox, which lists all pending mes-
sages. Also shown are any messages you’ve already listened to but have 
not deleted.

Visual Voice Mail uses the same greeting that was set when you first config-
ured carrier voicemail. To change the greeting, you have to dial carrier voice-
mail and follow the menus.

A
dmit it: You find it difficult to remember important information about 
people, such as birthdays for people in your family. Yes, it’s tough. 
My mom (to this day) writes everyone’s birthdates on my kitchen 
calendar. Every year, she just copies over the birthdays, 
month by month, except for people who have died. For 
phone numbers, lots of people had phone books or 
used the Yellow Pages to jot down numbers. That’s so 
20th century.
Here in the Digital Age, we have remarkable gizmos 
that help you keep track of all sorts of vital informa-
tion about the people you know. And, what better 
place to put that information than in your phone? It 
just makes sense.
 
Some applications access or affect the Contacts list 
maintained in your Droid 2. You’re alerted to any such 
applications when they’re installed on the phone. See 
Chapter 20 for more information on the Android Market.

Folks You Know
The name of the program on your phone that stores information about 
people you know is Contacts. I would normally write a contact lens joke here, 
but I just can’t seem to be pithy enough, so I’ll leave it at that.
Presenting the Contacts list
To peruse your phone’s address book, touch the Contacts icon, found at the 
bottom of the Home screen, just to the right of the Launcher button. You see 
a list of all contacts on your phone, organized alphabetically by first name, 
similar to the list shown in Figure 8-1.

Scroll the list by swiping with your finger. You see a thumb tab, shown in 
Figure 8-1, which you can use to quickly navigate up and down through your 
contacts. A large letter appears, telling you where you are in relation to the 
first names in the list.
To do anything with a contact, you first have to choose it: Touch a contact 
name and you see more information, as shown in Figure 8-2.

Make a phone call. To call the contact, touch one of the contact’s phone 
entries, such as Home or Mobile. See Chapter 5.
Send a text message. Touch the Text Message icon (see Figure 8-2) to 
open the Text Messaging app and send that contact a message. See 
Chapter 9 for information on text messaging on your Droid 2.
Compose an email message. Touch the Email link to compose an email 
message to the contact. When the contact has more than one email 
address, you can choose to which one you want to send the message. 
Chapter 10 covers using email on your phone.
Locate your contact on map. When the contact has a home or business 
address, you can touch the little doohickey next to the address, shown 
in Figure 8-2, to summon the Maps application. Refer to Chapter 15 for 
all the fun stuff you can do with Maps.
Oh, and if you have birthday information there, you can view it as well. 
Singing “Happy Birthday” is something you have to do on your own.
Finding your Me account
Looking for yourself? Your contact information on the Droid 2 is listed under 
the Me account. Sure, you may have another account, but the Droid 2 auto-
matically sets up your main account on the phone as Me.
You can scroll the Contacts list to find the Me account or, when viewing the 
Contacts list, you can follow these quick steps:
 
 
1. Press the Menu soft button.
 
2. Choose My Info.
 
 To combine the Me account with your Gmail (or another) account you 
have in the Contacts list, you link the accounts. After locating your Me 
account (refer to Steps 1 and 2), continue with these steps:
 
3. Press the Menu soft button.
 
4. Choose Link Account.
 
5. Choose your other account from the Contacts list.
 
 Scroll the list up and down, and then touch your other account name 
to select it. The two accounts are now linked, and the Me account — as 
well as your other account — show up together.
You can link any accounts in the Contacts list, such as people who have 
duplicate accounts for Facebook or Twitter or even on the phone but who 
may be listed under different names or organizations.

 Chapter 8: The People in Your Phone
Information about linked contacts appears at the bottom of the contact’s 
information, as shown in Figure 8-2. Touch the Triangle button in that gray 
area to see the additional, linked accounts.
To unlink an account, press the Menu soft button while viewing the contact 
information. Choose Unlink Contact. Then pluck the contact information you 
want to separate from the menu list that’s displayed.
Searching contacts
You can have a massive number of contacts. For example, I have 414 on my 
phone. I started out with just 80 contacts that I imported from Gmail; I added 
the rest as I phoned or met people. The problem: It can take a while to wade 
through that list.
 
 Rather than scroll the Contacts list with angst-riddled desperation, press the 
Search soft button. A Search All Contacts window appears. Type a few letters 
from the contact’s name and quickly you see the list of contacts narrowed to 
the few who match the letters you type. Touch a name from the search list to 
view the contact’s information.
 
You can also voice-search for a contact: After opening the Search All 
Contacts window, touch the Microphone icon on the onscreen keyboard and 
then speak the contact’s name when you see the Speak Now prompt. The 
sounds you utter appear in the Search text box, which you can then use to 
search the list.
 
✓ See Chapter 5 for information on voice dialing.
 
✓ The later section “A New Contact Is Born” tells you how to deal with 
adding new contacts. It’s next.
 
✓ No, there’s no correlation between the number of contacts you have and 
the number of bestest friends you have — none.
Using a Contact Quick Task widget
Motorola (or Verizon — I mean, who really knows?) preconfigured your Droid 2 
with some Contact Quick Task widgets on the Home screen, just to the right of 
the main Home screen. Four are available, as shown in Figure 8-3.
When you touch a blank widget (refer to Figure 8-3), the full Contacts list is 
displayed. Choose a contact to assign to the widget, and then touch various 
contact options — phone, text message, email — to place on the widget.
The first time you touch a widget with a phone number, you’re asked 
whether you want to activate one-touch calling. After that, touching the 
widget, or the phone part of a widget, instantly calls that contact.

 Chapter 8: The People in Your Phone
A New Contact Is Born
You have many ways to get contact information into your phone. You can 
build them all from scratch, but that’s tedious. More likely, you collect con-
tacts as you use your phone. Or, you can borrow contacts from your Gmail 
contacts. In no time, you’ll have a phone full of contact information.
Making a new contact
You can make a new contact for your Droid 2 phone in many ways.
Add a contact from the recent call log
One of the quickest ways to build up your Contacts list is to add people as 
they phone you — assuming that you’ve told them about your new phone 
number. After someone calls, you can use the Recent call log to add the 
person to your Contacts list. Obey these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Phone icon.
 
2. Choose the Recent tab.
 
3. Choose the phone number you want to create a contact for.
 
4. Choose Add to Contacts.
 
5. Choose New to make a new contact for that number.
Special and funky contact numbers
Even if you have no friends, or you have friends 
but don’t want them, a smattering of entries 
appears in your Contacts list — for one, the 
Me account, which represents you. Beyond Me 
(you), you may find some of these curious and 
interesting accounts to “dial”:
#BAL: Receive a free text message indicating 
your current cell phone charges as well as any 
previous payments you’ve made.
#DATA: Receive a free text message indicating 
your text message or data usage.
#MIN: Receive a free text message indicating 
the minutes you’ve used on the Droid 2, includ-
ing peak, off-hour, or weekend or whatever other 
categories for cell phone minutes they have.
#PMT: Make a payment using your Droid 2. This 
operation works only when you’ve configured 
your account to make payments via the phone.
#Warranty Center: Contact Verizon for trouble-
shooting and warranty issues regarding your 
Droid 2.
Customer Care: Contact Verizon support for 
your phone. (It’s a shortcut for the number 611, 
which is the support number for your Droid 2 
cell phone.)
See Chapter 9 for more information about read-
ing text messages on the Droid 2.

Part II: Phone 101 
 
 You can also choose Existing to add the phone number to an existing 
contact — for example, when Julie finally discloses that second cell 
phone number she never told you about. In that case, locate Julie’s (or 
whoever’s) contact in the list and then skip to Step 7.
 
6. Fill in the contact’s information.
 
 Use either of the Droid 2 keyboards to fill in the blanks, as many as you 
know about the caller: given name and family name, for example, and 
other information, if you know it.
 
 For a business, use only the Family Name field for the business name.
 
 If you don’t know any additional information, that’s fine; just filling in the 
name helps clue you in to who is calling the next time that person calls 
(using that same number).
 
 Use the Next button on the onscreen keyboard to hop between the vari-
ous text fields for the contact.
 
 Use the arrow keys on the sliding keyboard to hop between the 
text fields.
 
7. Touch the Save button.
 
 You’re done.
Create a new contact from scratch
Sometimes, it’s necessary to create a contact when you actually meet 
another human being in the real world. In that case, you have more informa-
tion to input, and it starts like this:
 
1. Touch the Contacts icon on the Home screen to access the 
Contacts list.
 
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose Add Contact.
 
4. Fill in the information on the Add Contact screen as best you can.
 
 Fill in the text fields with the information you know: Given Name and 
Family Name, for example.
 
 
 To expand a field, touch the green Plus button on the touchscreen or 
highlight that button using the arrow keys on the sliding keyboard and 
then press the OK button.
 
 Touch the gray button to the left of the phone number or email address 
to choose the location for that item, such as Home, Work, or Mobile.
 
 Touch the Triangle button next to Additional Info at the bottom of the 
list to add even more information!
 
5. Touch the Save button to complete editing and add the new contact.

 Chapter 8: The People in Your Phone
The new contact is automatically synced with your Google account on the 
Internet. That’s one beauty of the Droid 2: You don’t need to duplicate your 
efforts; the phone automatically updates all your Google account information 
on both the Droid 2 and the Internet.
Make a contact in Gmail on the Internet
One of the easiest ways to build up new contacts is to use your Gmail 
Contacts list on the Internet. It’s easy because you’re using a computer with 
a real keyboard and mouse to help you input the information. That method 
generally works better than typing with your thumbs on the Droid 2.
To add a new Gmail contact, follow these steps:
 
1. On a computer, browse to your Google Gmail account at http://gmail.
google.com.
 
2. Log in, if necessary.
 
3. Choose Contacts from the links listed on the left side of the page.
 
4. Click the New Contact button.
 
5. Fill in the contact information on the screen.
 
 Use the Add links to add more than one email address, phone number, 
or address or other information, for example, when a contact has both 
home and work addresses.
 
6. Click the Save button to save the contact information.
 
 You can repeat Steps 4 through 6 to create additional contacts.
Because the Droid 2 stays in sync with your Google account, any new con-
tacts you create on the Internet are automatically updated on your phone.
Build up contacts from your social networking sites
After you tell the phone which social networking sites you use, the Droid 2 
scours your friends and followers for information. New contacts are built 
from that information and automatically placed into your phone’s Contacts 
list. Even the avatar images associated with the accounts are saved on the 
Droid 2 Contacts list.
The key to pulling in contacts from your social networking sites is to use the 
Social Networking app on the Droid 2. Using this app is covered in Chapter 12.
Find a new contact by using a Maps location
When you use the Maps application to locate a restaurant, an apothecary, 
or a dirty book store, you can quickly create a contact for that location. 
Here’s how:
www.it-ebooks.info

Part II: Phone 101 
 
1. After searching for your location, touch the cartoon bubble that 
appears on the map.
 
 For example, in Figure 8-4, Angelo’s Ristorante has been found.
Figure 8-4: A business has been located.
 
2. Scroll to the bottom of the information summary for the business and 
choose the item Add As a Contact.
 
 The information from the Maps application is copied into the proper 
fields for the contact, including the address and phone number, plus 
other information (if available).
 
3. Touch the Save button.
 
 The new contact is created.
See Chapter 15 for detailed information on how to search for a location using 
the Maps application.
Editing a contact
When things change for a contact, or perhaps your thumbs were a bit too big 
when you created the contact while riding a bus during an earthquake, you 
can edit the contact information. Aside from just editing existing information 
or adding new items, you can also do a smattering of interesting things, as 
covered in this section.

 Chapter 8: The People in Your Phone
 
✓ See Chapter 6 for information on configuring a contact so that all their 
incoming calls go to voicemail.
 
✓ Also refer to Chapter 6 on how to set a contact’s ringtone.
 
✓ Contact information can come from multiple sources, so editing informa-
tion for a contact on your phone doesn’t change its original source. That 
is, unless the source is your Gmail Contacts list, in which case the Droid 2 
synchronizes your edits on the phone with the Contacts list on the 
Internet and vice versa.
Make basic changes
To make minor touch-ups on any contact, start by locating and displaying the 
contact’s information. Press the Menu soft button and choose Edit. You can 
then add any new information by touching a field and typing on either the 
onscreen keyboard or the sliding keyboard. You can edit information as well: 
Touch the field to edit and change whatever you want.
Chapter 4 contains information on how to edit text on the Droid 2.
When you’re done editing, touch the Save button.
Add a picture to a contact
It’s so much nicer to have a contact with a pretty picture instead of that 
boring silhouette icon. Well, unless your contact is really a two-dimensional 
silhouette.
To add a picture to your contact, it helps to already have the picture stored 
on the phone. You can transfer the picture from a computer (covered in 
Chapter 13), or you can snap a shot with the phone anytime you see the con-
tact or a person or an object that resembles the contact.
After the contact’s photo, or any other suitable image, is stored on the 
phone, follow these steps to update the contact’s information:
 
1. Locate and display the contact’s information.
 
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose Edit.
 
4. Touch the Add Picture icon.
 
 The icon is found to the left of the contact’s First Name field, where the 
contact’s picture would normally appear.
 
5. Choose the option Use Existing Photo.
 
6. Choose Gallery.
 
 The Droid 2 photo gallery is displayed. It lists all photos and videos 
stored on your phone.

7. Browse the gallery to look for a suitable image.
 
 See Chapter 17 for more information on using the Gallery.
 
8. Touch the image you want to use for the contact.
 
9. Select the size and portion of the image you want to use for the contact.
 
 Use Figure 8-5 as your guide. You can choose which portion of the image 
to use by moving the cropping box, and you can resize the cropping box 
to select more or less of the image.

10. Touch Save to assign the image to the contact.
 
11. Touch Save to complete editing the contact.
 
 The image is now assigned, and it appears whenever the contact is refer-
enced on your Droid 2.
 
You can add pictures to contacts on your Google account using any com-
puter. Just visit your Gmail Contacts list to edit a contact. You can then add 
to that contact any picture stored on your computer. The picture is eventu-
ally synced with the same contact on your Droid 2.
 
✓ Pictures can also be added by your Gmail friends and contacts when 
they add their own images to their accounts.
 
✓ Using a Picasa picture for a contact may not work on your phone. See 
Chapter 17 for more information on Picasa.
 
✓ To remove or change a contact’s picture, follow Steps 1 through 5 in the 
preceding step list and choose Remove Photo from the menu that pops up.

 Chapter 8: The People in Your Phone
Set the default phone number and email address
When a contact has multiple phone numbers or email addresses, you can 
choose which one becomes the default. That default number or address is used 
by the Quick Contact feature to let you easily phone or send the contact a mes-
sage. Here’s how to set a contact’s default phone number or email address:
 
1. Display the contact’s information.
 
2. Long-press the phone number you want to use as the main number.
 
 Touch and hold the phone number until the Options menu pops up.
 
3. Choose Make Default Number.
 
 The phone number is appended with a tiny white check mark.
 
4. Long-press the email address you want as the contact’s primary email 
contact.
 
5. Choose Make Default Email.
 
 As with the phone number, the email address entry grows a tiny white 
check mark.
See Chapter 5 for details about Quick Contact information.
Make a favorite
A favorite contact is someone you stay in touch with most often. It doesn’t 
have to be someone you like — just someone you (perhaps unfortunately) 
phone often, such as your bail bondsman.
The list of favorite contacts is kept on the Phone apps’ Favorites tab (refer 
to Figure 5-1, in Chapter 5). Touching that tab is the way to see your list of 
favorites. The top part of the list shows contacts you’ve flagged as favorites. 
The bottom part of the list displays numbers you frequently call.
To add a contact to the Favorites list, display the contact’s information 
and touch the Star button in the contact’s upper right corner, as shown in 
Figure 8-2. When the star is red, as shown in the figure, the contact is one of 
your favorites.
To remove a favorite, touch the contact’s star again and it loses its color. 
Removing a favorite doesn’t delete the contact, but it does remove it from the 
Favorites list.
 
✓ Occasionally peruse the names in the bottom part of the Favorites list, 
the frequent callers. You might consider promoting some of them to 
your favorites.
 
✓ The contact has no idea whether they’re one of your favorites, so 
don’t believe that you’re hurting anyone’s feelings by not making them 
a favorite.

Sharing a contact
You know Mary? I know Mary, too! But you don’t have her contact informa-
tion? Allow me to share that with you. Here’s what I do:
 
1. Summon the contact you want to share from your Contacts list.
 
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose Share Name Card.
 
4. Choose the items you want to share about the contact.
 
 All the items have green check marks by them. Touch a green check 
mark to deselect an item you don’t want to share about the contact.
 
5. Touch the Send button.
 
6. Choose how to send the information: Bluetooth, Email, Gmail, Text 
Messaging, or whatever else might be displayed.
 
 After choosing a method, the appropriate app appears for sharing the 
contact’s name card. For Bluetooth, see Chapter 14; for Email and Gmail, 
see Chapter 10; for text messaging see Chapter 9.
In a few Internet moments, the email message will be received.
What you’re sending is a vCard, a common type of file used by databases and 
personal information software to exchange contact information. You can use 
the vCard, for example, to import information into your computer’s email 
program.
Removing a contact
Every so often, consider reviewing your phone’s contacts. Purge those folks 
whom you no longer recognize or you’ve forgotten. It’s simple:
 
1. Locate the contact in your Contacts list and display the contact’s 
information.
 
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose Delete Contact.
 
 A warning may appear, depending on whether the contact has informa-
tion linked from your social networking sites. If so, dismiss the warning.
 
4. Touch OK to remove the contact from your phone.
 
Because the Contacts list is synchronized with your Gmail contacts for your 
Google account, the contact is also removed there.
For some linked accounts, such as Facebook, deleting the account from your 
phone doesn’t remove the human from your Facebook account. The warning 
that appears (before Step 4 in the preceding list) explains as much.

Y
ou might believe that the plain old telephone 
service, commonly called POTS, was good 
only for making phone calls. It was all about 
verbal communication — talking with someone 
across town or across the country. Then again, 
the POTS was also used for computer communica-
tions, thanks to dial-up modems. And, though 
crude and not widely popular, video phones are 
out there.
Communication on your Droid 2 doesn’t end with 
phone calls, and it isn’t as limited as on the POTS. 
You have many ways to keep in touch on your 
Droid 2 with friends and family ﬂ ung far and wide: 
text messaging, email, social networking, and even 
communications between your phone and other 
electronic devices. It’s all covered in this part of

▶ Managing your text messages
T
exting is the cell phone feature that lets you choose to type, rather than 
talk, to exchange information. It’s like turning the phone into a telegraph 
machine but without the tedium of having to learn Morse code. No, it’s 
just the tedium of having to use your thumbs to type a message 
rather than your voice to speak that I find curious. Despite 
that, texting is extremely popular: It’s a way to communi-
cate quickly, to exchange information without an obtru-
sive interruption.
The process of texting need not be explained to 
anyone under the age of 25. Those kids text all the 
time. Heck, texting is a major moneymaker for the 
cellular companies. For the rest of us, texting is 
something you can do from time to time to stay in 
touch. It’s handy. It might even be considered fun.
Message for You!
The common term for using a cell phone to send a text message 
to another cell phone is texting. I prefer to say it as “sending a text mes-
sage.” The program that handles this job on your Droid 2 is Text Messaging.

✓ Some Android applications can affect messaging. You’re alerted to whether 
the program affects messaging before it’s installed. See Chapter 20.
 
✓ Your cellular service plan may charge you per message for every text 
message you send. Some plans feature a given number of free messages 
per month. Other plans, favored by teenagers (and their parents), fea-
ture unlimited texting.
 
✓ Though using the Skype mobile app isn’t exactly the same as sending a 
text message, it does let you send instant messages to folks. The person 
you’re chatting with should have Skype installed, on either a PC or a 
mobile phone. Unlike text messages, Skype messages are free.
 
✓ The nerdy term for texting is SMS, which stands for Short Message 
Service.
Composing a new text message to a contact
Because most cell phones sport a text messaging feature, you can send a text 
message to just about any mobile number. It works like this:
 
1. Open the Contacts icon on the Home screen.
 
2. Choose a contact, someone to whom you want to send a text message.
 
3. Touch the Message icon next to the contact’s mobile number.
 
 The Message icon looks like an envelope (refer to Figure 8-2, in Chapter 8).
 
 A message composition window appears, which also tracks your text 
conversation, similar to the one shown in Figure 9-1.
 
4. Type the message text.
 
 Be brief. A text message has a 160-character limit. You can check the 
screen to see how you’re doing on that limit (refer to Figure 9-1). To help 
you stay under the limit, see the later sidebar “Common text-message 
abbreviations,” for some common and useful text message shortcuts 
and acronyms.
 
5. Touch the Send button.
 
 The message is sent instantly. Whether the contact replies instantly 
depends. When the person replies, you see the message displayed (refer 
to Figure 9-1).
 
6. Read the reply.
 
7. Repeat Steps 4 through 6 as needed — or eternally, whichever 
comes first.

✓ You can send text messages only to cell phones. Grandma cannot 
receive text messages on her landline that she’s had since the 1960s.
 
✓ You can use either keyboard — onscreen or sliding — to compose your 
text missive. See Chapter 4.
 
✓ You can press and hold the :-) button on the onscreen keyboard to see 
a whole range of smiles and other symbols (emoticons) that you can 
instantly insert into your messages.
 
✓ Yes, using Swype to type is much faster than using the standard 
onscreen keyboard. See Chapter 4.
 
✓ You can also dictate text messages by clicking the Microphone button on 
the onscreen keyboard. See Chapter 4 for more information on voice input.

✓ Phone numbers and email addresses sent in text messages become 
links. You can touch a link to call that number or visit the Web page.
 
✓ You cannot put the Enter (new line) key in the middle of a text message. 
In other words, a text message cannot appear with a break between two

Common text-message abbreviations
Texting isn’t about proper English. Indeed, many 
of the abbreviations and shortcuts used in tex-
ting are slowly becoming part of the English lan-
guage, such as LOL and BRB.
The weird news is that these acronyms weren’t 
invented by teenagers. Sure, the kids use them, 
but the acronyms find their roots in the Internet 
chat rooms of yesteryear. Regardless of a 
shortcut’s source, you might find them handy 
for typing messages quickly. Or, maybe you 
can use this reference for deciphering an acro-
nym’s meaning. You can type acronyms in either 
upper- or lowercase.

Sending a text message when you 
know only the phone number
I recommend that you create a contact for anyone you plan to message. It 
just saves time to have the contact there, with — at minimum — a name and 
phone number. When you don’t want to first create a contact, send any cell 
phone a text message by following these steps:
 
1. Open the Text Messaging app.
 
 You see a list of current conversations (if any), organized by contact 
name or phone number. If not, press the Back soft button.
 
2. Choose New Text Message, found at the top of the touchscreen.
 
3. Input a cell phone number in the To field.
 
 The onscreen keyboard automatically appears, though you have to 
touch the ?123 key to see the number keys.
 
 When the number you type matches one or more existing contacts, you 
see those contacts displayed. Choose one to send a message to that 
person; otherwise, continue typing the phone number.
 
4. Touch the Enter Message Here text box.
 
5. Type your text message.
 
6. Touch the Send button to send the message.
The message is sent instantly. You can wait for a reply or do something else 
with the phone, such as snooze it or choose to talk with a real person, face to 
face. Or, you can always get back to work.

You can send a single text message to multiple recipients: Just type addi-
tional phone numbers or contact names in the To field when you’re compos-
ing a new message. You can use the icon that appears on the right side of the 
To field to browse the Contacts list.
Receiving a text message
 
 
Whenever a new text message comes in, you see a message appear at the top 
of the Droid 2 touchscreen. The message goes away quickly, and then you 
see the New Text Message notification, shown in the margin.
To view the message, pull down the notifications, as described in Chapter 3. 
Touch the messaging notification and that conversation window immediately 
opens.
Multimedia Messages
When a text message contains a bit of audio or video or a picture, it ceases 
becoming a mere text message and transforms into — ta-da! — a multimedia 
message. This type of message even has its own acronym, MMS, which sup-
posedly stands for Multimedia Messaging Service.
 
✓ You can send pictures, video, and audio using multimedia messaging.
 
✓ There’s no need to run a separate program or do anything fancy to send 
media in a text message; the same Text Messaging app is used on the 
Droid 2 for sending both text and media messages. Just follow the advice 
in this section.
 
✓ Not every mobile phone can receive MMS messages. Rather than receive 
the media item, the recipient is directed to a Web page where it can be 
viewed on the Internet.
Whether to send a text message or an email?
The concept of sending a text message is similar to 
sending an email message. Both methods of com-
munication have advantages and disadvantages.
Text messages are short and to the point. 
They’re informal, more like quick chats. Indeed, 
the speed of reply is often what makes text mes-
saging useful. But, like email, sending a text 
message doesn’t guarantee a reply.
An email message can be longer than a text 
message. You can receive email on any com-
puter or device that accesses the Internet. 
Email message attachments are handled better, 
and more consistently, than text message 
(MMS) media. Though email isn’t considered 
formal communication, not like a paper letter or 
a phone call, it ranks a bit higher in importance 
than text messaging.

 Chapter 9: The 21st Century Telegram (Texting)
Composing a multimedia message
One of the easiest ways to send a multimedia message is to start with the 
source, such as a picture or video stored on your phone. You can then 
choose to use MMS to share that media item, by heeding these directions:
 
1. Locate in the Gallery the image or video you want to share.
 
 You have to be viewing the image or video, so if it appears in a folder or 
an album, open the album and then touch the image to view it.
 
 See Chapter 17 for more information on how the Gallery works.
 
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose Share.
 
4. Choose Text Messaging from the pop-up menu.
 
 When the image or video is too large to send as a text message, you see 
a warning message. Dismiss the warning and try again with a smaller 
image or video.
 
5. Type a contact name or phone number into the To text field.
 
 Type only the first part of a contact name, and then choose the proper 
contact from the list that appears.
 
6. Type a message in the Enter Message Here text box.
 
7. Touch the Send button to send the multimedia message.
Unlike sending a text message, sending the multimedia message takes 
some time.
After the message is sent, you see a copy of the image or video in the 
message history.
Attaching media to a message
You don’t need to go hunting for already created multimedia to send in a 
message; you can attach media directly to any message or ongoing conversa-
tion. It works like this:
 
1. Compose a text message as you normally do.
 
 Refer to the directions earlier in this chapter, in the section “Composing 
a new text message to a contact.”
 
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose Insert.
 
 A pop-up menu appears, listing various media items you can attach to a 
text message. Here’s a summary:

Part III: Beyond Telephone Communications 
 
 Take Picture: Take a picture right now and send it in a text message.
 
 Picture: Choose an image stored in the phone’s Gallery.
 
 Audio: Attach a song from the music library.
 
 Record Audio: Record an audio clip, such as your voice, and then 
send it.
 
 Video: Choose a video you’ve taken with the phone and stored in 
the Gallery.
 
 Record Video: Record a video and then send it as media in a text 
message.
 
 Slideshow: Create a collection of photos to send together.
 
 Name card: Attach contact information in the form of a vCard.
 
 More options may appear on the menu, depending on which apps you 
have installed on your Droid 2.
 
4. Choose a media attachment from the pop-up menu.
 
 What happens next depends on the attachment you’ve selected.
 
 For the Pictures and Video attachments, you choose from among media 
stored on your phone.
 
 For Capture Picture, Capture Video, and Record Audio, you create the 
media and then send it.
 
 The Slideshow option presents a second screen, where you collect pic-
tures from the Gallery. Use the icons on top of that screen to add pictures 
from the Gallery. Use the Preview button to examine the slideshow.
 
 The Name Card option displays the phone’s address book. Choose a 
contact and that contact’s information is then translated into a vCard 
file and attached to your text message.
 
5. Optionally, compose a message to accompany the media attachment.
 
6. Touch the Send button to send your media text message.
In just a few, short, cellular moments, the receiving party will enjoy your mul-
timedia text message.
 
✓ Not every phone is capable of receiving multimedia messages.
 
✓ Be aware of the size limit on the amount of media you can send; try to 
keep your video and audio attachments brief.
 
✓ A vCard is a contact-information file format, commonly used by email 
programs and contact management software. Whether the recipient 
can do anything with a vCard in a multimedia text message is up to the 
recipient’s phone software.

Receiving a multimedia message
Multimedia attachments come into your Droid 2 just like any other text mes-
sage does, but you see a thumbnail preview of whichever media was sent, 
such as an image, a still from a video, or a Play button to listen to audio. To 
preview the attachment, touch it. To do more with the multimedia attach-
ment, long-press it. Choose how to deal with the attachment by selecting an 
option from the menu that’s displayed.
For example, to save an image attachment, long-press the image thumbnail 
and choose the Save Picture command.
Some types of attachments, such as audio, cannot be saved.
Message Management
Even though I’m a stickler for deleting email after I read it, I don’t bother 
deleting my text message threads. That might be because I receive far more 
email than text messages. Anyway, were I to delete a text message conversa-
tion, I would follow these exact steps:
Text messaging alternatives
Life doesn’t turn totally dismal when you find 
yourself unduly bound by text message limita-
tions on your cell phone contract. Just because 
you have a 250-message limit doesn’t mean that 
you and your friends must stay horribly out of 
touch or that your thumbs will grow weak from 
lack of typing. A smattering of free alternatives 
to text messaging are available, all of which use 
the Internet and two of which come preinstalled 
on the Droid 2.
Talk: The Talk app connects you with the 
Google Talk service on the Internet. It’s not 
really a texting app, but, rather, a chat app. You 
can summon a list of friends, all configured from 
your Google account, and chat it up — as long 
as they’re available. My advice is to configure 
Google Talk on your computer first and then 
you can find the same friends available on your 
Droid 2.
Skype mobile: The Skype mobile app can be 
used to chat as well, if you’ve set up a slew of 
friends and they also have Skype mobile or the 
full-fledged Skype on their desktop computers. 
Chatting on Skype is easy and free. Also see 
Chapter 21 for additional information on Skype 
mobile.
Of course, these apps use the Internet, so if 
your phone has a data restriction, you face, the-
oretically, a surcharge for using more Internet 
than your cell phone plan allows. Even so, text 
applications such as Google Talk and Skype 
mobile (chat) tend not to eat up much in terms 
of Internet usage. So type away!

1. Open the conversation you want to remove.
 
 Choose the conversation from the main Messaging screen.
 
 
2. Touch the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose Delete.
 
4. Touch the Yes button to confirm.
 
 The conversation is gone.
If I wanted to delete every dang doodle conversation shown on the main

1. Touch the Menu soft button.
 
2. Choose Select Multiple.
 
3. Touch the box next to each conversation you want to zap.
 
 Obviously, if you want to keep one, don’t touch its box.
 
 A green check mark appears by conversations slated for execution.
 
4. Touch the Delete button.
The selected messages are gone.
It’s an emergency alert!
Another type of message you can receive on 
your Droid 2 is the emergency alert. To peruse 
your options, open the Applications Tray and 
open the EMERGENCY app. On the main screen, 
you see any pending alerts, such as evacuation 
alerts for your area or even AMBER Alerts. Of 
course, considering that the notification set-
tings for the EMERGENCY app are preset to be 
active, you would have already seen such alerts 
on the Droid 2 home page.
To configure emergency alerts, press the Menu 
soft button when viewing the main Emergency 
Alert screen. Choose the command Emergency 
Alert Settings. You can review the types of 
available alerts by choosing the Receive Alerts 
menu command.
Press the Home soft button to exit the 
EMERGENCY app.

I
t has been said that the number-one reason for most people to use 
the Internet is email. That was probably before Facebook 
became popular. Even so, email is now the preferred form 
of written communications, eclipsing the personal, hand-
written note years ago. Though some nostalgia over 
the change may linger, I have to confess that I can 
read none of my relatives’ handwriting anyway, so 
perhaps the whole personal letter thing was over-
blown to begin with. Anyway.
As a communications device, your Droid 2 is more 
than capable of sending and receiving email. In fact, 
because it’s a Google phone, you instantly receive 
updates of your Gmail on the Droid 2. You can also 
configure the phone to access your non-Gmail email, 
making your electronic missives conveniently available 
wherever you go.

Mail Call!
Electronic mail is handled on the Droid 2 by two apps: Gmail and Email.
The Gmail app hooks directly into the Gmail account associated with your 
Google account. In fact, they’re exact echoes of each other: The Gmail you 
receive on your computer is also received on your phone.
You can also use the Email app on your phone to connect to non-Gmail elec-
tronic mail, such as the standard mail service provided by your ISP.
Regardless of the app, electronic mail on your phone works just like it does 
on your computer: You can receive mail, create new messages, forward 
email, send messages to a group of contacts, and work with attachments, 
for example. As long as your phone has a data connection, email works 
just peachy.
 
✓ You can run the Gmail and Email apps by touching the Launcher on the 
Home screen and then locating the apps on the Applications Tray.
 
✓ Adding the Gmail or Email app icon to the Home screen is easy: See 
Chapter 22.
 
✓ A Gmail account was created for you when you signed up for a Google 
account. See Chapter 2 for more information about setting up a Google 
account.
 
✓ Both Gmail and Email programs can be configured to handle multiple 
email accounts, as discussed later in this chapter.
 
✓ Though you can use your phone’s Web browser to visit the Gmail Web 
site, you should use the Gmail app to pick up your Gmail. I believe that 
you’ll find the Gmail app’s interface more usable on your phone than the 
Gmail Web site interface.
 
✓ If you forget your Gmail password, visit this Web address:
www.google.com/accounts/ForgotPasswd
 
✓ Refer to Chapter 14 for information on the Droid 2 data connection.
You’ve Got Email
The Droid 2 works flawlessly with Gmail. In fact, if Gmail is already set up to 
be your main email address, you’ll enjoy having access to your messages all 
the time by using your phone.

 Chapter 10: Mail of the Electronic Kind
Regular email, handled by the Email program, must be set up before it can be 
used. See the later section “Email Configuration” for details. After completing 
that quick and occasionally painless setup, you can receive email on your 
phone just as you can on a computer.
Getting a new message
You’re alerted to the arrival of a new email message in your phone by a 
notification icon. The icon differs between a new Gmail message and an 
Email message.
 
 For a new Gmail message, you see the New Gmail notification, shown in the 
margin, appear at the top of the touchscreen.
 
 For a new email message, you see the New Email notification.
To deal with the new-message notification, drag down the notifications and 
choose the appropriate one. You’re taken right to your inbox to read the new 
message.
 
✓ See the later section “Setting email options” to set up how the phone 
reacts when you get a new email message.
 
✓ Refer to Chapter 3 for information on notifications and how to 
peruse them.
Checking the inbox
To peruse the mail you have, start your email program — Gmail for your 
Google mail or Email for other mail you have configured to work with the 
Droid 2 — and open your electronic inbox.
To check your Gmail inbox, start the Gmail app. It can be found on the 
Applications Tray, or it might dwell on the Home screen just to the left of the 
main Home screen. The Gmail inbox is shown in Figure 10-1.
 
 To open the inbox screen when you’re reading a message, press the Back 
soft button.
To check your Email inbox, open the Email app. You’re taken to the inbox for 
your primary email account, though when you have multiple email accounts on 
your Droid 2, you should use the Messaging app, covered in the next section.

may no longer show up on the Droid 2.

The Messaging app is your home plate for every account on your Droid 2

message. Those starred messages can be viewed or searched separately, 
making them easier to locate later.

messages in the Email program, because they’re deleted when your 
computer’s email program picks them up later.
 
✓ I find it easier to delete (and manage) Gmail using a computer.
Searching Gmail
You can use the Search soft button to search Gmail on your phone, just as 
you can search for anything else. The key is to use the Search soft button 
while you’re in the Gmail program. Here’s how:
 
1. Open the Gmail inbox.
 
 
2. Touch the Search soft button.
 
3. Type the text to find.
 
 You can also dictate the text by first pressing the Microphone button on 
the keyboard and then speaking what you’re trying to find.
 
4. Touch the Search button to begin the search.
 
 Peruse the results.
The search results are limited to text in those programs’ messages. To per-
form a wider search throughout the entire phone, touch the Search soft 
button when viewing the Home screen.
Make Your Own Mail
Every so often, someone comes up to me and says, “Dan, you’re a computer 
freak. You probably get a lot of email.” I generally nod and smile. Then they 
say, “How can I get more email?” The answer is simple: To get mail, you 
have to send mail. Or, you can just be a jerk on a blog and leave your email 
address there. That works too, though I don’t recommend it.

Sending an email message from any of your online email accounts other than 
Gmail is handled by the Messaging app. You can use the Email app as well, 
which works the same way, but I believe that you’ll find using the Messaging 
app far more flexible. It works like this:
 
1. Open the Messaging app.
 
2. Touch the green Plus button found in the upper right part of the 
screen.
 
 If you have any draft messages pending, you see a list displayed. To start 
a new message, choose the New Message option.
 
3. If prompted, choose the email account you want to use to send the 
message.
 
 Or, you can choose to compose a text message, though that topic is cov-
ered specifically in Chapter 9.
 
4. Craft the message.
 
 Figure 10-6 illustrates the New Message window. Fill in the blanks just as 
you would when composing an email message on your computer.
 
5. Touch the Send button to send the message.
Copies of the messages you send in the Email program are stored in the Sent 
mailbox. To see that mailbox, open an individual email account from the 
main Messaging window. Press the Menu soft button and choose Folders to 
see the mailbox folders associated with that account.
The Font menu, shown in Figure 10-6, contains options for setting the text 
font (typeface), text size, and text foreground and background colors.

2. Locate the contact to whom you want to send an electronic message.
 
 Review Chapter 8 for ways to hunt down contacts in a long list.
 
3. Touch the email icon next to the contact’s email address.
 
 The icon looks like a wee postage stamp with an at-symbol (@) in 
the middle.
 
4. Choose the Compose command to use Gmail to send the message or 
choose Email to send an email message using your main email account.
 
 At this point, creating the message works as described in the preceding 
sections; refer to them for additional information.

Message Attachments
You can send and receive email attachments by using your Droid 2. Though 
this feature is nice, an email attachment is more of a computer thing, not 
something that’s wholly useful on a cell phone.
For receiving attachments, the Droid 2 lets you view the attachment, to see 
its contents. Not every attachment is viewable, however. It all depends on the 
type of file attached to the message.
Email messages with attachments are flagged in the inbox with the Paper 
Clip icon, which seems to be the standard I-have-an-attachment icon for most 
email programs. When you open one of those messages, you may see the 
attachment name appear, as shown in Figure 10-7. Touch the Preview button 
to witness the attachment on your phone.
Figure 10-7: An email attachment.
What happens after you touch the Preview button depends on the type of 
attachment. Sometimes, you see a list of apps from which you can choose 
one to open the attachment. Many Microsoft Office documents are opened by 
the QuickOffice app.
Some attachments cannot be opened. In those cases, use a computer to fetch 
the message and attempt to open the attachment. Or, you can reply to the 
message and inform the sender that you cannot open the attachment on 
your phone.
 
✓ Sometimes, pictures included in an email message aren’t displayed. You 
find a Show Pictures button in the message, which you can choose to 
display the pictures.
 
✓ You cannot save certain email attachments on your phone. Wait until you 
retrieve these messages on your computer to save their attachments.
 
✓ You can add an attachment to an email message you create: Touch the 
Menu soft button and choose either the Attach or Attach Files com-
mand. You can then choose what to attach.
 
✓ You can browse the Gallery and choose a photo or video to email: Long-
press the photo and choose the Share command from the bottom of the 
screen. Choose Email or Gmail from the pop-up menu to begin a new 
message with that photo or video attached.
 
✓ See Chapter 17 for more information on the Gallery.

Email Configuration
There are a few things you can do to customize the email experience on your 
Droid 2. You can add one or more of your Internet email accounts so that you 
can receive email on your phone at any time. You can customize an email 
signature, plus set other options, some of which are boring, so I don’t discuss 
them in this section.
Setting up an email account
When you have and use non–Gmail email accounts, you can configure the 
phone’s Email program to work with each of them. Here’s how it’s done:
 
1. Start the My Accounts app.
 
 The My Accounts app is found in the Applications Tray, which you 
access by touching the Launcher button at the bottom of the Home 
screen.
 
2. Touch the Add Account button.
 
3. Choose the Email icon to add your Internet email account.
 
 If prompted, agree to the Motorola Service agreement; touch the Next 
button.
 
 The Droid 2 needs to know information about your email account — 
those techy tidbits typically supplied by your ISP or whatever outfit pro-
vides your email service.
 
4. Input the email address you use for the account.
 
5. Input the password for that account.
 
6. Remove the check mark by the option Automatically Configure 
Account.
 
 Though the Droid 2 is good, it’s not good enough to guess how to 
configure a standard Internet email account without some additional 
information.
 
 If you’re configuring a Web-based email account, such as Windows Live 
or MobileMe, you can keep the check mark and touch the Next button. 
In many cases, the Droid 2 can automatically configure those accounts. 
If so, you see a Success message; touch the Done button and you’re 
ready to use the account on the Droid 2.
 
7. Touch the Next button.
 
8. Choose General Settings.

9. Fill in the information for account name, real name, and email address.
 
 For the Account Name field, type a name to recognize the account, such 
as Comcast Email or AOL Email or whatever name helps you recognize 
the account.
 
 In the Real Name field, type your name or screen name or whatever 
name you want to appear in the From field of your outgoing email 
messages.
 
 The Email Address field is the address your recipients use when reply-
ing to your messages.
 
10. Touch the OK button.
 
11. Choose Incoming Server.
 
12. Fill in the fields per the information provided by your Internet service 
provider (ISP).
 
 For most ISP email, the server type is POP3 (shown as the POP 
mail server).
 
 The Server field contains the name of the ISP’s POP3 server.
 
 The Port is 110 for a POP3 server, so you can leave that field as is.
 
 The username is the name you use to log in to your ISP to retrieve email.
 
 The password is your ISP email password.
 
13. Touch the OK button.
 
14. Choose Outgoing Server.
 
15. Fill in the fields.
 
 Fill in the SMTP Server name as provided by your ISP.
 
 The Port is 25 for SMTP servers.
 
 As you did in Step 12, fill in your username and password for your ISP’s 
email. If the information is already there, confirm that it’s correct.
 
16. Touch the OK button.
 
17. Choose Other Settings.
 
18. Ensure that Never Delete Messages is chosen from the list.
 
 By selecting Never Delete Messages, you ensure that email you receive 
on your Droid 2 can be picked up later when you use your computer.
 
19. Touch OK.
 
20. Touch OK again to create the email account.
The account is now listed in the My Accounts screen, along with Google and 
Facebook and whatever other accounts you’re accessing from your Droid 2.

 Chapter 10: Mail of the Electronic Kind
You can set up a ton of email accounts on the Droid 2, one for each email 
account you have. They all appear in a list in the Messaging program, as 
shown earlier, in Figure 10-2.
 
Not every Web-based email account can be automatically configured by the 
Droid 2. When doubt exists, you see an appropriate warning message. In 
most cases, the warning message also explains how to properly configure the 
Web-based email account to work with your phone.
You can add a Yahoo! Mail account directly: In Step 3 of the preceding list, 
choose the Yahoo! Mail icon.
Creating a signature
I highly recommend that you create a custom email signature for sending 
messages from your phone. Here’s my signature:
DAN
This was sent from my Droid 2.
Please forgive the typos.
To create a signature for Gmail, obey these directions:
 
1. Start Gmail.
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose More and then Settings.
 
 If you see no settings, choose Back to Inbox and repeat Steps 2 and 3.
 
4. Choose Signature.
 
5. Type or dictate your signature.
 
6. Touch OK.
You can obey these same steps to change your signature; the existing signa-
ture shows up after Step 4.
To set a signature for the Email program, heed these steps:
 
1. In the Email program, start a new message.
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose More and then choose Email Settings.
 
4. Choose Compose Options.

5. Edit the Email Signature area to reflect your new signature.
 
 The preset signature is Sent via DROID on Verizon Wireless. Feel free to 
edit it at your whim.
 
6. Touch the Done button.
 
7. Press the Back button to return to the message, where you can touch 
Cancel to stop composing a new message.
The signature you set appears in all outgoing messages.
Setting email options
A smattering of interesting email settings are worth looking into. To reach the 
Settings screen in Gmail, follow Steps 1 through 3 in the first set of steps in 
the preceding section; for Email, follow Steps 1 through 4 in the second set 
of steps.
Here are some items worthy of note:
 
✓ Specify a default email account in the Email program by choosing 
Default Email Account. Then choose the account name you want to use 
for sending messages.
 
✓ To specify how frequently the Email program checks for new messages, 
choose Email Delivery on the Email Settings screen. Put a check mark 
by Data Push and then set the check frequency by choosing the Fetch 
Schedule item.
 
✓ Choose Email Notifications in Gmail, or Notifications in Email, to have 
the phone alert you to new messages.
 
✓ Choose a specific ringtone for the account by touching Select Ringtone, 
beneath Notifications for Gmail. In the Email program, choose Email 
Notifications and then Select Ringtone.
 
✓ Specify whether the phone vibrates upon the receipt of new email by 
choosing Vibrate.
 
✓ The ringtone and vibration options are available only when Email 
Notifications is selected.

▶ Looking at a Web page on your phone

▶ Bookmarking pages
▶ Working with multiple browser windows
▶ Searching the Web
▶ Sending a link to a friend
▶ Downloading stuff from the Web
▶ Changing the home page
A
s a Web designer myself, I confess that no one truly sets out to 
craft Web pages for easy viewing on a doinky cell phone 
screen. Sure, special mobile versions of Web pages are 
available; my Wambooli Web site has such a feature. But 
Web designers secretly desire you to view their work 
on a lovely, roomy, pixel-laden desktop monitor.
Despite the yearning of Web page designers, it’s 
entirely possible to venture out on the Web using 
your Droid 2. Though the screen may not be large 
enough to show you everything, the browsing expe-
rience you enjoy on your computer carries over 
quite well to your phone. This chapter shows you 
how everything works and offers some tips to 
make your mobile Web browsing adventures 
more enjoyable.
 
✓ If possible, activate the Droid 2 Wi-Fi connection before 
you venture out on the Web. Though you can use the phone’s 
cellular data connection, the Wi-Fi connection can be far faster. See 
Chapter 14 for more information.

✓ Depending on your cell plan, you may be charged extra for data sent and 
received by your Droid 2.
 
✓ The Droid 2 has apps for Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube and, 
potentially, other popular locations or activities on the Web. I highly 
recommend using these applications on the phone over visiting the Web 
sites using the phone’s browser.
Behold the Web Page
The World Wide Web should be familiar to you. Using the World Wide Web 
on a cell phone, however, may not be. Don’t worry: Consider this section 
your quick orientation.
Viewing the Web
Begin your venture out on the Internet by starting the Browser app. 
You might find it on the main Home screen, or you can locate it on the 
Applications Tray. The Browser app is your phone’s Web browser. Figure 11-1 
shows how it looks.
 
Because the Droid 2 screen isn’t a full desktop screen, not every Web page 
looks good on it. Here are a few tricks you can use:
 
✓ Pan the Web page by dragging your finger across the touchscreen. You 
can pan up, down, left, and right.
 
✓ Double-tap the screen to zoom in or zoom out.
 
✓ Pinch the screen to zoom out, or spread two fingers to zoom in.
 
✓ Tilt the phone to its side to read a Web page in Landscape mode. 
Then you can spread or double-tap the touchscreen to make teensy 
text more readable.
Visiting a Web page
To visit a Web page, type its address in the Address box (refer to Figure 11-1) 
and then type the Web page address. You can also type a search word, if 
you don’t know the exact address of a Web page. You can touch the Enter or 
Return button on the sliding keyboard or the Go button on the onscreen key-
board to search the Web or visit a specific Web page.
If you don’t see the Address box, swipe your finger so that you can see the 
top of the window, where the Address box lurks.

You click links on a page by using your finger on the touchscreen. A better 
way is to use the arrow keys on the sliding keyboard: Press an arrow key to 
highlight various links on the page. Press the OK key to select a link.
 
✓ To reload a Web page, press the Menu soft button and choose the 
Refresh command. Refreshing updates a Web site that changes often, 
and the command can also be used to reload a Web page that may not 
have completely loaded the first time.
 
✓ To stop a Web page from loading, touch the X button that appears to the 
left of the Address box. (The X button replaces the Bookmarks button — 
refer to Figure 11-1.)
Browsing back and forth
 
 To return to a previous Web page, press the Back soft button. It works just 
like clicking the Back button on a computer’s Web browser.
The Forward button also exists in the Browser program: Press the Menu soft 
button and choose the Forward command.

To review the long-term history of your Web browsing adventures, follow 
these steps:
 
 
1. Press the Menu soft button.
 
2. Choose Bookmarks.
 
3. At the top of the Bookmarks page, choose History.
To view a page you visited weeks or months ago, you can choose a Web page 
from the History list.
 
To clear the History list, press the Menu soft button while viewing the list 
and choose the Clear History command.
Using bookmarks
Bookmarks are those electronic breadcrumbs you can drop as you wander 
the Web. Need to revisit a Web site? Just look up its bookmark. This advice 
assumes, of course, that you bother to create (I prefer drop) a bookmark 
when you first visit the site. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Visit the Web page you want to bookmark.
 
2. Touch the Bookmark button, found at the top of the Browser window.
 
 Refer to Figure 11-1 to see the location of the Bookmark button. After 
pressing the button, you see the Bookmarks screen, shown in Figure 11-2. 
The screen lists your bookmarks, showing Web site thumbnail previews.
 
3. Touch the Add button.
 
 The Add button appears in the upper left square on the Bookmarks 
screen (refer to Figure 11-2). It has the name of the site or page you’re 
bookmarking just below the square.
 
4. If necessary, edit the bookmark name.
 
 The bookmark is given the Web page name, which might be kind of 
long. I usually edit the name to make it shorter so that it fits beneath the 
thumbnail square.
 
5. Touch OK.
After the bookmark is set, it appears in the list of bookmarks. You can swipe 
the list downward to see the bookmarks and all their fun thumbnails.
Another way to add a bookmark is to touch the Most Visited tab at the top of 
the Bookmarks screen (refer to Figure 11-2). That screen lists the Web pages 
you visit most often. To add one of those pages, long-press the thumbnail 
and choose the command Add Bookmark.

screen. Choose the command Delete Bookmark. Touch the OK button 
to confirm.
 
✓ Bookmarked Web sites can also be placed on the Home screen: Long-
press the bookmark thumbnail and choose the command Add Shortcut 
to Home.
 
✓ You can switch between Thumbnail and List views for your bookmarks: 
When viewing the Bookmarks screen, press the Menu soft button and

✓ You can obtain the MyBookmarks app at the Android Market. The app 
can import your Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome bookmarks from 
your Windows computer into the Droid 2. See Chapter 20 for more infor-
mation on the Android Market.
 
✓ Refer to Chapter 4 for information on editing text on the Droid 2.
Managing multiple Web page windows
Because the Browser app sports more than one window, you can have mul-
tiple Web pages open at a time on your Droid 2. You can summon another 
browser window in one of several ways:
 
✓ To open a link in another window, press and hold that link by using your 
finger or holding down the OK key on the sliding keyboard. Choose the 
command Open in New Window from the menu that appears.
 
✓ To open a bookmark in a new window, long-press the bookmark and 
choose the command Open in New Window.
 
✓ To open a blank browser window, press the Menu soft button and choose 
New Window.
 
 You switch between windows by pressing the Menu soft button and choosing 
the Windows command. All open Browser windows are displayed on the 
screen; switch to a window by choosing it from the list. Or, you can close a 
window by touching the Minus button to the right of the window’s name.
New windows open using the home page that’s set for the Browser application. 
See the section “Setting a home page,” later in this chapter, for information.
Searching the Web
The handiest way to find things on the Web is to use the Google widget, often 
found floating on the first Home screen to the left of the main Home screen, 
and shown in Figure 11-3. Use the Google widget to type something to search 
for or touch the Microphone button to dictate what you want to find on the 
Internet.

 To search for something anytime you’re viewing a Web page in the Browser 
app, press the Search soft button. Type the search term into the box. You 
can choose from a suggestions list, shown in Figure 11-4, or touch the Go 
button to complete the search using the Google search engine.
Figure 11-4: Searching for things on the Internet.
To find text on the Web page you’re looking at, rather than search the entire 
Internet, follow these steps:
 
1. Visit the Web page where you want to find a specific tidbit o’ text.
 
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose the More command.
 
4. Choose Find on Page.
 
5. Type the text you’re searching for.
 
6. Use the left- or right-arrow button to locate that text on the page — 
backward or forward, respectively.
 
 The found text appears highlighted in green.
 
7. Touch the X button when you’re done searching.

Sharing a page
The Android operating system lets you easily share information you find on 
your phone. With regard to the Web pages you visit, you can easily share 
links and bookmarks. Follow these steps:
 
1. Long-press the link or bookmark you want to share.
 
2. Choose the command Share Link.
 
 A pop-up menu of places to share appears, looking similar to Figure 
11-5. The variety and number of items on the Share Via menu depends 
on the applications installed on your phone. For example, you might see 
Twitter or Facebook appear, if you’ve set up those social networking 
sites on your Droid 2 (see Chapter 12).
Figure 11-5: Options for sharing a Web page.
 
3. Choose a method to share the link.
 
 For example, choose Email to send the link by mail or Text Messaging to 
share via a text message.
 
4. Do whatever happens next.
 
 Whatever happens next depends on how you’re sharing the link.
Most likely, whatever happens next opens another application, where you 
can complete the process. Refer to various parts of this book for specific 
information.

The Perils and Joys of Downloading
One of the most abused words in all computerdom is download. People don’t 
understand what it means. It’s definitely not a synonym for transfer or copy, 
though that’s how I hear it used most often.
 
For the sake of the Droid 2, a download is a transfer of information from 
another location to your phone. When you send something from the phone, 
you upload it. There. Now the nerd in me feels much better.
You can download information from a Web page into your phone. It doesn’t 
work exactly like downloading does for a computer, which is why I wrote this 
section.
 
✓ There’s no need to download program files to your Droid 2. If you want 
new software, you can obtain it from the Android Market, covered in 
Chapter 20.
 
 
✓ When the phone is downloading information, you see the Downloading 
notification.
Grabbing an image from a Web page
The simplest thing to download is an image from a Web page. It’s cinchy: 
Long-press the image. You see a pop-up menu appear, from which you 
choose the command Save Image.
 
✓ The image is copied and stored on your Droid 2 — specifically, in the 
Gallery in a special folder named Download.
 
✓ Refer to Chapter 17 for information on the Gallery.
 
✓ Technically, an image is stored on the phone’s MicroSD card. You can 
read about storage on the MicroSD card in Chapter 13.
Downloading a file
When a link opens a document on a Web page, such as a Microsoft Word doc-
ument or a PDF (Adobe Acrobat) file, you can download that information to 
your phone. Simply long-press the download link and choose the command 
Save Link from the menu that appears.
You can view the link by referring to the Download History screen. This 
screen appears after the download is complete. See the next section.

Part III: Beyond Telephone Communications 
Reviewing your downloads
You can view downloaded information by perusing the Download History 
screen, shown in Figure 11-6. That screen normally appears right after 
you download anything, or you can summon it at any time while using the 
Browser app, by pressing the Menu soft button, choosing the More com-
mand, and then choosing Downloads.
Figure 11-6: The Download History screen.
The stuff you download is viewed by using special apps on your phone, such 
as the QuickOffice app, which can view Microsoft Office files, or QuickPDF, 
which displays PDF documents. Don’t fret the process: Simply choose from 
the Download History screen the item you downloaded and you can then see 
it on your phone.
 
✓ Well, of course, some of the things you can download you cannot view. 
When that happens, you see an appropriately rude error message.
 
✓ You can quickly review any download by choosing the Download 
notification.
Web Controls and Settings
More options and settings and controls exist for the Browser program than 
just about every other program I’ve used on the Droid 2. It’s complex. Rather 
than bore you with every dang doodle detail, I thought I’d present just a few 
of the options worthy of your attention.

Setting a home page
The home page is the first page you see when you start the Browser applica-
tion, and it’s the first page that’s loaded when you fire up a blank window. To 
set your home page, heed these directions:
 
1. Browse to the page you want to set as the home page.
 
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose More.
 
4. Choose Settings.
 
 A massive list of options and settings appears.
 
5. Choose Set Home Page.
 
 It’s way down the list, so swipe the list downward as necessary.
 
 After choosing the Set Home Page command, you see a Set Home Page 
box, where you can type the home page address. Because you obeyed 
Step 1, you don’t need to type that address now.
 
6. Touch OK.
 
 The home page is set.
Unless you’ve already set a new home page, the Droid 2 comes configured 
with the Google Mobile search page as your home page.
 
If you want your home page to be blank (not set to any particular Web page), 
set the name of the home page (refer to Step 5) to about:blank. That’s the 
word about, a colon, and then the word blank, with no period at the end and 
no spaces in the middle. I prefer a blank home page because it’s the fastest 
Web page to load. It’s also the Web page with the most accurate information.
Changing the way the Web looks
You can do a few things to improve the way the Web looks on your phone. 
First and foremost, don’t forget that you can orient the phone horizontally to 
see a wide view on any Web page.
From the Settings screen, you can also adjust the text size used to display a 
Web page. Heed these steps:
 
 
1. Press the Menu soft button.
 
2. Choose More.
 
3. Choose Settings.

4. Choose Text Size.
 
5. Select a better size from the menu.
 
 For example, try Large or Huge.
 
6. Press the Back soft button to return to the Web page screen.
I don’t make any age-related comments about text size at this time, and espe-
cially at this point in my life.
Setting privacy and security options
With regard to security, my advice is always to be smart and think before 
doing anything questionable on the Web. Use common sense. One of the 
most effective ways that the Bad Guys win is by using human engineering to 
try to trick you into doing something you normally wouldn’t do, such as click 
a link to see a cute animation or a racy picture of a celebrity or politician. As 
long as you use your noggin, you should be safe.
As far as the phone’s settings go, most of the security options are already 
enabled for you, including the blocking of pop-up windows (which normally 
spew ads).
If Web page cookies concern you, you can clear them from the Settings 
window. Follow Steps 1 through 3 in the preceding section and choose the 
option Clear All Cookie Data.
You can also choose the command Clear Form Data and remove the check 
mark from Remember Form Data. These two settings prevent any characters 
you’ve input into a text field from being summoned automatically by some-
one who may steal your phone.
You might be concerned about various warnings regarding location data. 
What they mean is that the phone can take advantage of your location on 
Planet Earth (using the Droid 2 GPS or global satellite positioning system) 
to help locate businesses and people near you. I see no security problem in 
leaving that feature on, though you can disable location services from the 
Browser’s Settings screen: Remove the check mark by Enable Location. You 
can also choose the item Clear Location Access to wipe out any information 
saved in the phone and used by certain Web pages.
See the earlier section “Browsing back and forth” for steps on clearing your 
Web browsing history.

The Social Networking Thing
In This Chapter
▶ Accessing Facebook on your phone
▶ Updating your Facebook status
▶ Sharing photos on Facebook
▶ Configuring Twitter for the Droid 2
▶ Sending a tweet
▶ Accessing other social networking sites
I
t’s entirely possible to be quite a social person, to have hundreds (if not 
thousands) of friends, and to have people cling to your every movement 
yet never leave your house. That’s the miracle of social networking on the 
Internet. Web sites such as Facebook and Twitter have thrust even 
the most mundane human life into a 24-hour digital ogle-fest. 
Thanks to the Droid 2 and its social networking abilities, 
you can do more to become a digital social networking 
butterfly. Now you can fete the world with your life 
broadcast digitally on the Internet and leave your 
house.
Your Life on Facebook
The most popular of all social networking sites is 
Facebook. At this Internet destination, you can offer 
your thoughts, say what you’re doing, share photos 
and videos, play games, and enjoy other diversions. 
To get started, you need a Facebook account, if you don’t 
have one already. Then you can use the Facebook or social 
networking apps on your Droid 2 to keep up with your busy online 
social life.

✓ Though you can access Facebook on the Web by using the Browser app, 
I highly recommend that you use the Facebook app on the Droid 2.
 
✓ You can also use the Social Networking app to view or set Facebook 
status updates, though it’s not as useful as the Facebook app.
 
✓ Facebook is one of the most popular sites on the Internet at the time 
this book goes to press. On some days, it sees more Internet traffic than 
Google.
Creating a Facebook account
To use Facebook on your Droid 2, you must have a Facebook account. The 
easiest way to do that is to visit www.facebook.com on your computer and 
register for a new account. Remember your login name and password.
You confirm your Facebook account by replying to an email message. After 
you do that, Facebook is ready for your thoughts and photos and other 
personal details. Also, after confirming your Facebook account, you can set it 
up on your phone by following these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Launcher button to display the 
Applications Tray.
 
2. Open the My Accounts icon.
 
 If you see a Facebook account listed, you’re done. Otherwise:
 
3. Touch the Add Account button.
 
4. Choose Facebook.
 
5. Touch the Email text box.
 
6. Type the email address you used to sign up for Facebook.
 
7. Touch the Password text box.
 
8. Type your Facebook password.
 
 The characters you type turn into big dots so that no one looking at the 
phone can see your password.
 
9. Touch the Next button.
 
 The Droid 2 signs you in to your Facebook account.

10. If you see an alert about Facebook now being the source for your 
contact pictures, touch the OK button.
 
 The Droid 2 synchronizes information between your phone’s Contacts 
list and your Facebook Friends list. Part of that process includes the 
pictures, some of which may be missing for your contacts but available 
on Facebook.
 
11. Touch the Done button.
 
 You’re done.
Adding your Facebook account by following these steps doesn’t install the 
Facebook app on your phone. To do that, see the later section “Visiting 
Facebook.”
If you opt not to install the Facebook app, you can use the Social Networking 
app that comes with the Droid 2 to manage your Facebook account, though I 
believe that you’ll find the Facebook app a better resource.
Checking your social networking status
The Social Networking app keeps track of your status updates and news 
feeds on Facebook (as well as on other social networking sites). Start the app 
from the Launcher to review current status updates.
You also see Facebook status updates whenever you receive a phone call 
from a Facebook friend. The friend’s status appears below their contact 
information during the incoming call.
The Social Networking app is continuously updated; keep it visible on the 
Droid 2 touchscreen to instantly monitor status updates as they flow in.
 
You can find new messages and notifications from Facebook by using the 
Messaging app.
Visiting Facebook
 
 The true interface to Facebook on your Droid 2 is the Facebook app. You can 
download the app from the Android Market, as described in Chapter 20, or 
you can use the barcode that appears in the margin to quickly obtain an app 
link, as described in this book’s Introduction.

Start the Facebook app after it’s downloaded. You may need to accept an end 
user license agreement. Then you have to log in to your Facebook account 
using the Facebook app. (The Facebook app is different from the Social 
Networking app; both require you to log in.)
The main Facebook screen is shown in Figure 12-1. It’s a rather simplistic 
interface, yet it’s the spot where you can check most of the things you do 
on Facebook, including uploading a photo or keeping your status up-to-date 
wherever you go with your Droid 2.
Figure 12-1: Facebook on your 
phone.
When you choose an item from the main Facebook screen, another screen 
opens, with more information. Here are the items on the main Facebook 
screen:
News Feed: View status updates newly added photos, and other information 
about your Facebook friends.
Profile: Review your personal Facebook page, your status updates, and 
whatever else you’re wasting your time doing on Facebook.
Friends: See a list of all your Facebook friends, search for friends, or touch a 
friend’s icon to see their status and other information.

 Chapter 12: The Social Networking Thing
Photos: Review your Facebook photo albums or use the Droid to take a 
digital picture and then send it to Facebook. See the later section “Sending a 
picture to Facebook.”
Events: Check for upcoming birthdays, anniversaries, parties, or events you 
plan to attend.
Messages: See any private messages sent to you on Facebook.
Requests: Review any requests made by friends for you to participate in 
many interesting and tedious diversions.
 
 To return to the main Facebook screen from another area, press the Back 
soft button.
 
✓ You can also check the status for your Facebook friends by reviewing 
the Social Networking widgets on the Home screen. The widgets are 
preinstalled on the leftmost Home screen.
 
 
✓ When things related to you happen on Facebook, you see the Facebook 
notification icon. When you receive lots of Facebook notices or updates, 
a number in a red circle appears on the icon, indicating the number of 
new Facebook updates.
 
✓ Sometimes, choosing a Facebook notification opens the Facebook app, 
and sometimes it opens the Browser app to visit Facebook on the Web.
 
✓ Review Chapter 3 to see how to deal with notifications.
 
✓ See Chapter 22 for information on placing the Facebook app icon on the 
Home screen.
 
✓ To sign out of Facebook on your phone, touch the Menu soft button 
when viewing the main Facebook screen and then choose the Logout 
command. Touch the Yes button to confirm.
Setting your Facebook status
With Facebook on your phone, you can add a new status, such as “Taking a 
shower now and it’s getting extremely difficult to type on the touchscreen,” 
while you’re standing there naked in the shower and typing on a cell phone 
(which I don’t recommend). Still, your Facebook friends may live for these 
moments.

To update your Facebook status on the Droid 2, follow these steps:
 
1. From the main Facebook screen, choose either News Feed or Profile.
 
2. Type or dictate your status in the What’s On Your Mind text box.
Your Facebook friends see your status update instantly, plus they see the 
tiny Mobile icon appear next to your status update, as shown in Figure 12-2.
Figure 12-2: A mobile Facebook update.
The Mobile icon tells your pals that the update was made by using your cell 
phone.
Sending a picture to Facebook
One of the handiest reasons to use Facebook on a cell phone is that you can 
take a picture and instantly upload it. This feature lets you easily capture 
and share various intimate and private moments of your life with drooling 
throngs of humanity.
The key to sharing a picture on Facebook is to locate the wee Camera icon, 
found to the left of the What’s On Your Mind text box. After touching that 
icon, you see a pop-up appear, with these two options:
Choose from Gallery: After choosing this option, you’re switched to the 
Gallery app, from which you can choose any photo already stored on your 
phone.
Capture a Photo: After you choose this option, the Droid 2 switches into 
Camera mode, where you can snap a picture of whatever is around you. After 
taking the picture, you see a quick prompt, from which you can choose Done 
to accept the picture, Retake to try to take the picture again, or Cancel to 
give up and go back to playing horseshoes.
Whether you choose a picture from the Gallery or take a picture using 
the Droid 2 camera, you end up at a screen similar to the one shown in 
Figure 12-3. Use this screen to add a caption to the image and publish it on 
Facebook.

After a spell, the image is uploaded to your Facebook Mobile Uploads album.
You can use the Facebook app to view the image in Facebook, or you can use 
Facebook on any computer connected to the Internet.
 
✓ Images are uploaded into the Mobile album, unless you choose another 
album, as shown in Figure 12-3.
 
✓ Refer to Chapter 16 to see how the Droid 2 camera works.
 
✓ See Chapter 17 for more information on using the Gallery app.

Changing various Facebook settings
The commands that control Facebook are stored on the Settings screen, 
which you access by touching the Menu soft button while viewing the main 
Facebook screen (shown in Figure 12-1) and choosing the Settings command.
Most settings are self explanatory: You simply choose which Facebook 
events you want the Droid 2 to monitor. Two items you might want to set 
are the refresh interval and the way the phone alerts you to new Facebook 
activities.
Choose Refresh Interval to specify how often the Droid 2 checks for new 
Facebook activities. You might find the one-hour value to be too long for 
your active Facebook social life, so choose something quicker. Or, to disable 
Facebook notifications, choose Never.
Three options determine how the Droid 2 reacts to Facebook updates:
Vibrate: Vibrates the phone
Phone LED: Flashes the notification light on the front of the Droid 2
Notification Ringtone: Plays a specific ringtone
For the notification ringtone, choose the Silent option when you want the 
phone not to make noise upon encountering a Facebook update.
Become Famous with Twitter
The Twitter social networking site proves the hypothesis that everyone will 
be famous on the Internet for 140 words or fewer.
Like Facebook, Twitter is used to share your existence with others or simply 
to follow what others are up to or thinking. It sates some people’s craving 
for attention and provides the bricks that pave the road to fame — or so I 
believe. I’m not a big Twitter fan, but your phone is capable of letting you 
tweet from wherever you are.
 
✓ They say that of all the people who have accounts on Twitter, only a 
small portion of them actively use the service.
 
✓ A message posted on Twitter is a tweet.
 
✓ You can post messages on Twitter or follow other people or organizations 
who post messages.

 Chapter 12: The Social Networking Thing
Setting up Twitter on the Droid 2
My advice is to set up an account on Twitter using a computer, not your 
phone. Visit http://twitter.com on a computer and follow the directions 
there for creating a new account.
After creating a Twitter account, you use the Social Networking app on your 
phone to log in to Twitter and then view Twitter updates or make tweets. To 
set up Twitter using the Social Networking app, follow these steps:
 
1. Start the My Accounts app.
 
 You can also use the Social Networking app to set up your Twitter 
account, but doing so just takes you back to the My Accounts app. So 
I’m saving you two steps.
 
2. Touch the Add Account button.
 
3. Choose Twitter.
 
4. Type your Twitter username into the Username field.
 
5. Type your Twitter password.
 
6. Touch the Next button.
 
 You’re prompted to use Twitter as the source for your contact pictures. 
My advice: If you’re already using Facebook as the source, touch No.
 
7. Touch the Done button.
 
 Your Twitter account is set up for social networking on the Droid 2.
You can now use the Social Networking app to review messages, or tweets, 
sent by those whom you’re following on Twitter.
You can also review tweets by opening the Messaging app.
Getting the Twitter app
 
Perhaps the best way to use Twitter on your Droid 2 is to obtain the Twitter 
app. It provides a better interface into Twitter than the Social Networking 
and Messaging apps do on your phone. And, it looks more “Twittery,” like the 
Twitter Web site.
 
 The Twitter app can be obtained from the Android Market. Use the barcode 
in the margin to see a quick link to the app. Refer to Chapter 20 for additional 
information on installing the app on your phone.

Tweeting to other twits
The Twitter app (see the preceding section) provides an excellent interface 
to many Twitter tasks, as shown in Figure 12-4. The two most basic tasks, 
however, are reading and writing tweets.
See tweets directed at you
New tweet notiﬁcation
Read tweets
New tweet
Live tweet updates
Touch to view the tweet
Figure 12-4: The Twitter app.
To read tweets, choose the Tweets item (refer to Figure 12-4). Recent tweets 
are displayed in a list, with the most recent information at the top. Scroll the 
list by swiping it with your finger.
To tweet, touch the Create Tweet icon found in the upper right corner of 
the screen (refer to Figure 12-4). Use the Create Tweet screen to send text, 
upload an image from the Gallery, or take a new picture.

 Chapter 12: The Social Networking Thing
You can also compose a new tweet by using the Social Networking or 
Messaging apps, though the techniques are rather laborious compared with 
using the Twitter app.
Other Social Networking Opportunities
The Web seems to see a new social networking phenomenon just about every 
week. The field isn’t limited to Facebook and Twitter, though both capture a 
lot of media attention and are extremely popular.
Other common social networking sites include
 
✓ Google Buzz
 
✓ LinkedIn
 
✓ Meebo
 
✓ MySpace
 
 These sites may have special Android apps you can install on your Droid 2, 
such as the MySpace Mobile app.
As with Facebook and Twitter, you should always configure an account using 
a computer and then set up options on your phone.
After adding some social networking apps, you may see them appear on 
various Share menus on the Droid 2. Use the Share menus to help you share 
media files with your online social networking pals.

N
o man is an island. Neither should a technological gizmo be an island. 
Not only is water bad for a gizmo’s electronics, but it would also be 
lonely. The Droid 2 is anything but lonely, thanks to its wireless networking 
abilities. I believe that the Droid 2, beyond those abilities, also yearns for a 
physical form of communications; it dreams of being able to touch 
something. . . .
To fulfill your phone’s desires, I offer you this chapter. 
Its topic is the exchange of information between your 
phone and your computer. It’s called sharing, which 
you learned about in kindergarten. The things to 
share are your phone’s contacts, photos, music, 
and videos and other types of digital information 
that flows easily and quickly between the Droid 
2 and your computer — as long as you heed the 
advice in this chapter.
Make the Connection
The Droid 2 does a super job of sharing your stuff on the 
Internet. You can upload images to the Picasa Web site or buy 
music from the Amazon MP3 store, for example, and the phone always 
synchronizes information between itself and various online Google 
applications, such as Calendar and Gmail.

Part III: Beyond Telephone Communications 
You can also share digital information between your Droid 2 and your 
computer. Before that happens, you need to properly connect the two 
gizmos, both physically and mentally. This section covers both aspects.
Connecting the phone to the computer
Communication between your computer and the Droid 2 works fastest when 
both devices are physically connected. That connection happens by using 
the USB cable that came with the phone. Like nearly every computer cable 
in the Third Dimension, the USB cable has two ends:
 
✓ The A end of the USB cable plugs into the computer.
 
✓ The micro–USB end of the cable plugs into the left flank of the Droid 2.
Follow these steps to connect the phone to the computer and put the two 
devices on speaking terms:
 
1. Plug the USB cable into one of the computer’s USB ports.
 
2. Plug the USB cable into the phone.
 
 
 If the phone is turned on, an alert may sound. If you can see the screen, 
you see an alert notification: USB Connection. The USB notification 
icon (shown in the margin) appears.
 
 At this point, you can choose to do nothing; to make the phone and 
the computer start talking, however, you have to deal with the USB 
notification.
 
3. Pull down the notifications.
 
 Refer to Chapter 3 for specific instructions on pulling down notifications.
 
4. Choose USB Connection.
 
 You see four methods for using the USB connection to your computer, 
as shown in Figure 13-1.
 
 You can use any of the first three options — PC Mode, Windows Media 
Sync, or USB Mass Storage — for sharing and synchronizing between the 
Droid 2 and your computer. Each one is subtly different. For example, 
Windows Media Sync simply tells the computer that the Droid 2 is a 
media device, which lets you more easily share music, photos, and 
videos.
 
 The fourth option, Charge Only, uses the USB cable to recharge the 
battery; the phone isn’t recognized by the computer as a storage device.
 
5. Select an option and touch the OK button.
 
 The phone’s main storage device, the MicroSD card, is mounted on your 
computer’s storage system.

 Chapter 13: Share and Synchronize
Figure 13-1: USB connection options.
 
The first time you connect the Droid 2 to a PC, you see the AutoPlay dialog 
box appear in Windows. Choose the option Install Motorola Driver and follow 
the directions on the screen to proceed with installation. The Motorola 
driver is required by Windows so that your computer and the phone can 
communicate in a happy manner.
After the phone is connected, you use your computer to access the phone’s 
MicroSD card. The card appears as a storage device mounted to your computer, 
just like a media card or thumb drive. In Windows, the MicroSD card can be 
accessed from the Computer window. On a Macintosh, the phone’s MicroSD 
card appears as an icon on the desktop. See the later section “Accessing 
information on the MicroSD card.”
 
✓ When in doubt about which USB connection mode to choose, I recommend 
selecting the USB Mass Storage option.
 
✓ On a Macintosh, use either the Charge Only or USB Mass Storage option 
for connecting the phone. The Mac may not recognize the Droid 2 when 
you set the PC Mode or Windows Media Sync options.
 
✓ When you’re done accessing information on the Droid 2, you should 
properly unmount the phone from your computer system. See the next 
section.

Part III: Beyond Telephone Communications 
 
✓ The Droid 2 remains connected to the computer even when the 
touchscreen turns off (the phone “sleeps”).
 
✓ Even after choosing Charge Only mode, you may still see the 
MotoConnect feature become activated and a Web page appear on the 
computer screen after you connect the Droid 2. See the later sidebar 
“The joys and perils of MotoConnect” for information on halting this 
rude behavior.
 
✓ If you don’t have a USB cable for your phone, you can buy one at any 
computer- or office-supply store. Get a USB-A-male-to-micro-B-USB cable. 
Tell them Murray the Squid sent you.
 
✓ Another advantage of connecting your phone to your computer is that 
the phone charges itself as long as it’s plugged in. It charges even when 
it’s turned off, but the computer must be on for the phone to charge.
 
✓ The phone charges even when you choose a USB option other than 
Charge Only.
 
✓ The Droid 2 cannot access its MicroSD card while the phone is mounted 
into a computer storage system. Items such as your music and photos 
are unavailable until you disconnect the phone from the computer; you 
see a message saying that the SD card is busy, unmounted, or unavailable. 
See the next section.
Disconnecting the phone from the computer
After transferring information between the computer and phone, you should 
properly unmount the MicroSD card from the computer’s storage system. 
Heed these steps:
 
1. Pull down the notifications.
 
 Refer to Chapter 3 if you need more help accessing your phone’s 
notifications.
 
2. Choose USB Connection.
 
3. Choose Charge Only.
 
4. Touch the OK button to confirm.
 
 The MicroSD card is unmounted and can no longer be accessed from 
your computer. The phone’s icon disappears from the Computer 
window or desktop.
 
5. If you’re using a Macintosh, drag the Droid 2 storage icon into the 
Trash.
 
 You must properly unmount the phone from the Mac’s storage system 
before you disconnect the cable.
 
6. If necessary, unplug the USB cable.

 Chapter 13: Share and Synchronize
If you choose to keep the phone connected to the computer, the phone 
continues to charge. (Only when the computer is off does the phone not 
charge.) Otherwise, the computer and phone have ended their little 
tête-à-tête and you and the phone are free again to wander the earth.
 
✓ Do not unplug the Droid 2 when the USB cable is connected and the 
MicroSD card is mounted. Doing so may damage the MicroSD card and 
render invalid all information stored on your phone. It’s A Bad Thing.
 
✓ You can leave the A end of the USB cable plugged into the computer, if 
you find it convenient. I do. That makes it easier to reconnect the phone 
later.
Your Phone’s Storage
 
Information stored on your phone (pictures, videos, music) is kept on the 
MicroSD card. The card works like a storage device in your computer, keeping 
your phone’s information stored in files and organized using folders. It’s all 
complex computer stuff, and you’re free to merrily skip it all — unless you’re 
curious about how things are stored on the phone or you need to exchange 
information between the phone and your computer.
Accessing information on the MicroSD card
To view the information on your phone, stored on the MicroSD card, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Connect the phone to the computer.
 
2. Mount the phone’s MicroSD card on the computer’s storage system.
 
 See specific directions in the section “Connecting the phone to the 
computer,” earlier in this chapter. My recommendation is to choose the 
USB connection option USB Mass Storage.
The joys and perils of MotoConnect
When you connect the Droid 2 to a Windows 
computer, you may experience the effects of 
the MotoConnect program. Specifically, after 
connecting the Droid 2, you may see a Web 
page open and urge you to download the 
V CAST Media Manager program, which is 
covered elsewhere in this chapter.
To manage MotoConnect, you use its icon in 
the notification area, usually found on the far 
right end of the taskbar, at the bottom of the 
computer screen. Disable MotoConnect by 
right-clicking the Motorola icon and choosing 
When Phone Connects, Launch➪Nothing.

3a. In Windows, open the Computer window.
 
 You can choose Computer from the Start menu or press the Win+E key 
combination to see the Computer window. The icon representing the 
phone looks like a typical Windows hard drive icon. The only puzzle is 
figuring out which drive letter icon represents the phone.
 
 To know for certain which icon represents the Droid 2 MicroSD 
card, unmount the phone (follow the directions in the earlier section 
“Disconnecting the phone from the computer”) and then remount it. 
The icon that disappears and then reappears in the Computer window 
represents your phone. Generally, it should be assigned the same drive 
letter every time you mount it.
 
3b. On a Macintosh, open the new drive icon that appears on the desktop.
 
 Macs line up storage icons on the right edge of their screens, from top to 
bottom. The Droid 2 MicroSD card appears as a generic drive icon and 
has the name NO NAME, unless you were clever and named the MicroSD 
card something else.
After you mount the Droid 2 MicroSD card to your computer, you can access 
the information stored there. The information is made available as though 
your phone were a thumb drive or another form of external computer storage, 
which in fact is what it is when the Droid 2 is connected to your computer.
 
✓ To transfer a file to your phone, such as a ringtone or contact, simply 
drag the file’s icon from wherever it dwells on your computer to the 
MicroSD icon. This action copies the file, creating a duplicate file on the 
phone.
 
✓ I wouldn’t bother trying to organize files and folders on the MicroSD 
card. Sure, you can try, but the Droid 2 manages those folders. Anything 
you do is pointless, unless you’re one of those obsessive people who 
feels compelled to organize everything.
 
✓ The best way to transfer music, photos, and videos between the phone 
and your PC is to use the doubleTwist program, covered in the next 
section.
 
✓ There’s no need to synchronize information such as dates, contacts, 
and email messages between the Droid 2 and your computer. All that 
information is synchronized automatically and wirelessly between the 
phone and your Google account.
 
✓ When you’re done accessing the MicroSD card from your com-
puter, unmount it by following the directions in the earlier section

✓ You don’t need to use a computer to access files on your Droid 2. 
The Files app, found in the Applications Tray, can be used to 
browse files and folders found on the phone. Apps are also avail-
able at the Android Market for managing the files and folders on 
your Droid 2. One that I can recommend is Linda Manager. It’s free 
from the Android Market. See Chapter 20.
Unmounting, removing, and 
replacing the MicroSD card
Most of the time, the MicroSD card dwells contently inside your Droid 2. Rarely, 
if ever, do you need to remove it. If you decide to remove it, you must unmount it 
first. This type of unmounting is different from unmounting the phone when it’s 
connected to the computer. (Well, it’s similar, but not the same.)
The good news is that you don’t need to formally unmount the MicroSD card. 
That’s because in order to remove the card, you have to remove the phone’s 
battery. Therefore, the phone is turned off when you remove the MicroSD 
card and, by the laws of physics and sanity, is already unmounted.
To remount the MicroSD card, simply turn your phone on again.
The manual steps for unmounting the MicroSD card are listed here:
 
1. Ensure that the phone isn’t connected to a computer by a USB cable.
 
 Free the phone from the computer, as described earlier in this chapter.
 
2. From the Applications Tray, choose Settings.
 
3. Choose SD Card & Phone Storage.
 
4. Choose Unmount SD Card.
 
 You should hear an alert, after which you can turn off the phone and 
remove its MicroSD card.
After the MicroSD card has been unmounted by following these steps, you 
have no access to the information stored there: The Droid 2 doesn’t show 
your photos or music or other types of information.
 
✓ To reaccess the MicroSD card after unmounting it, turn on the phone again.
 
✓ You can get a second, larger-capacity MicroSD card for use with your 
phone at any computer- or office-supply store. You have to format the 
MicroSD card when you insert it into the Droid 2.
 
✓ To format a new MicroSD card, follow the steps in this section. After (or 
in place of) Step 4, choose the command Format SD Card.
 
✓ See Chapter 1 for information on removing the MicroSD card from the 
phone.

Part III: Beyond Telephone Communications 
That Syncing Feeling
The physical part of connecting your Droid 2 to a computer involves the 
cables and communicating with the MicroSD card. The mental part is 
synchronization, or the process of exchanging your stuff between the phone 
and the computer. The result is that you end up with the information you 
want where you want it.
Synchronizing with doubleTwist
One of the most popular ways to move information from an Android phone 
into a computer — and vice versa — is to use the third-party utility doubleTwist. 
This amazing program is free, and it’s available at www.doubletwist.com.
The doubleTwist app isn’t an Android app. You use it on your computer. It 
lets you easily synchronize pictures, music, videos, and Web page subscriptions 
between your computer and its various media libraries and any portable 
device, such as the Droid 2. Additionally, doubleTwist gives you the ability to 
search the Android Market and obtain new apps for your phone.
To use doubleTwist, connect your phone to your computer as described 
elsewhere in this chapter. Ensure that USB sharing is on; mount the MicroSD 
card as a USB mass storage device. The doubleTwist program often starts 
automatically as soon as you connect the Droid 2. If it doesn’t, start it manually. 
The simple doubleTwist interface is illustrated in Figure 13-2.
To best use doubleTwist, first ensure that the Motorola Droid 2 (recognized 
for some reason as Motorola A955 in Figure 13-2) is chosen from the list of 
media storage locations on the left side of the window. Then select all items 
on the General tab (refer to Figure 13-2). Click the Sync button and the 
categories that you’ve selected are then synchronized between the phone 
and your computer.
The DLNA thing
The Droid 2 is compliant with the Digital 
Living Networking Alliance, known as DLNA. 
Compliant devices are configured so that they 
can easily share information — specifically, 
media files such as pictures, videos, and music. 
When two DLNA gizmos are connected, either 
directly or wirelessly, the warmth from their 
sharing fills the room.
Seriously, on the Droid 2, DLNA makes it easier 
for your phone to share information with 
DLNA-compliant computers, game consoles, 
televisions, and other gizmos. You must first 
connect the devices, directly or wirelessly, and 
then run either the DLNA or Media Share app, 
both of which can be found on the Applications 
Tray.

Of course, if you have a lot of photos or videos or music on the computer, 
you may want to be more selective: The phone’s MicroSD card can hold only 
so much stuff. In that case, click each tab (refer to Figure 13-2) and choose 
the music, pictures, videos, and subscriptions you want to synchronize 
between the phone and the computer. Then click the Sync button to transfer 
the information.
 
✓ Versions of doubleTwist are available for both the PC and the Mac.
 
✓ Refer to a handy computer book for information on installing new 
software, such as doubleTwist.
 
✓ doubleTwist doesn’t synchronize contact information. The Droid 2 
automatically synchronizes your phone’s Contacts list with Google.
 
✓ You can use many programs on your desktop computer to store photos, 
videos, and music. On the PC, all three types of media are stored using 
Windows Media Player. On the Mac, photos can be stored using iPhoto, 
and iTunes is the main music program. You have to use those programs, 
or similar ones, to move the media to your computer before you can use 
doubleTwist to synchronize that media to your phone.

✓ Even though you can use other programs to organize media on your 
computer, doubleTwist still searches everywhere on the computer to 
look for photos, video, and music.
 
 
✓ A doubleTwist app available from the Android Market is a media-playing 
program, not one used for synchronizing files between your Droid 2 and 
a computer.
 
✓ Subscriptions are podcasts or RSS feeds or other types of updated 
Internet content that can be delivered automatically to your computer.
Using the V CAST Media Manager
One thing that the MotoConnect software does is display a Web page where 
you can download the V CAST Media Manager. Do so. The V CAST Media 
Manager, shown in Figure 13-3, is a program for coordinating media — music, 
videos, pictures — between your PC and the Droid 2.
Figure 13-3: The V CAST Media Manager, copying files.
After downloading and installing the V CAST Media Manager, connect 
the Droid 2 to your Windows computer and activate the USB connection 
as described earlier in this chapter. You can then use the V CAST Media 
Manager to view and synchronize media between the phone and the PC.

Network Your Droid 2
In This Chapter
▶ Using Wi-Fi on the Droid 2
▶ Connecting to a Wi-Fi network
▶ Turning on Bluetooth networking
▶ Adding a Bluetooth headset
T
he Droid 2 packs more power than a typical computer from 20 years ago. 
The graphics are better. Arguably, even the Droid 2 munchkin keyboard 
is better than the cheesy membrane keyboards that were popular on early 
PCs. But you know what the best thing is — what makes the Droid 2 far 
superior to those ancient computers? No wires. That means no wires to 
power the Droid 2, but also no wires for basic communications and 
networking.
Your Droid 2 can access wireless networks with ease, 
the same wireless networks you may have used with 
a laptop computer or have seen other people at 
Starbucks use with their laptop computers. You can 
also access Bluetooth devices with Droid 2 wireless 
networking. This chapter covers all the basic wire-
less networking stuff.
Wireless Network Access
Though you can’t see it, wireless communications is 
going on all around. No need to duck — the wireless sig-
nals are intercepted only by items such as cell phones and 
laptop computers. The Droid 2 uses those signals to let you talk 
on the phone and communicate over the Internet and other networks.

Part III: Beyond Telephone Communications 
Using the digital network
The Droid 2 uses the cellular network to not only send and receive phone 
calls but also communicate with the Internet. The phone can access several 
types of cellular digital network:
3G: The third generation of wide-area data networks is several times faster 
than the previous generation of data networks. 3G networks also provide for 
talking and sending data at the same time.
EDGE: The best of the second generation of cellular technologies allows for 
wide-area communications with the Internet, but not at the same time as 
when using voice communications.
GPRS: This second-generation (2G) network is for sending data, thought it 
isn’t as fast as EDGE.
Your phone always uses the best network available. So, if the 3G network is 
within reach, it’s the network the Droid 2 uses for Internet communications. 
Otherwise, the 2G (GPRS or EDGE) network is chosen.
A notification icon for the network used by the phone appears in the status 
area, right next to the Signal Strength icon. When digital information is being 
transmitted, the arrows in the network icon become animated, indicating that 
data is being sent or received or both.
 
As the time this book goes to press, 4G networks are starting to appear. 
These new networks sport speeds as much as ten times faster than 3G 
networks. Hopefully, soon the Droid 2 hardware and cellular service will be 
updated to handle the new 4G networks.
Creating a 3G mobile hotspot
You can configure the Droid 2 to share its cellular data network connection 
with as many as eight other devices. Those devices connect wirelessly with 
your phone, accessing a shared 3G network just like a laptop computer or 
another type of mobile device accesses a Wi-Fi network. In this process, a 
mobile wireless hotspot is created. The Droid 2 is one of the few smartphones 
that’s up to the task.
To set up a 3G mobile hotspot with your Droid 2, heed these steps:
 
1. From the Applications Tray, open the 3G Mobile Hotspot icon.
 
 You may see text describing the process. If so, dismiss the text.

 Chapter 14: Network Your Droid 2
 
2. Touch the box to place a green check mark by the 3G Mobile Hotspot 
option.
 
 A warning message appears, recommending that you plug your Droid 2 
into a power source because the 3G mobile hotspot feature sucks down 
a lot of battery juice.
 
3. Touch the OK button to dismiss the warning.
 
 If you’ve not yet set up a 3G mobile hotspot, you need to supply some 
information.
 
4. Input a name for your Droid 2 hotspot.
 
 A name is already generated and appears on the touchscreen. You can 
type a new name, if you like.
 
5. Input a password.
 
 The password must be applied, and it must be at least eight characters 
long.
 
 I recommend placing a check mark by the Show Password option; you 
don’t get a second chance to confirm the password, and if you mistype 
something using the onscreen keyboard, you’ll never know what you did 
wrong.
 
6. Touch the Save button to save your settings and set up the hotspot.
 
 You’re done, though one more warning message may appear: Click the 
OK button to dismiss the final warning.
 
 When the 3G hotspot is active, you see the Mobile Hotspot Service status 
icon appear, as shown in the margin. You can then access the hotspot using 
any computer or mobile device that has Wi-Fi capabilities.
To turn off the 3G hotspot, pull down the Mobile Hotspot Service notification 
and remove the green check mark.
 
✓ You cannot activate 3G network sharing and use a Wi-Fi connection at 
the same time on the Droid 2. (See the next section, about the Wi-Fi 
connection on your Droid 2.)
 
✓ The range for the Droid 2 Wi-Fi hotspot is about 30 feet.
 
✓ Whether your Droid 2 allows for 3G data sharing depends on your cellular 
carrier. Some carriers may limit that ability, and others may charge extra.
 
✓ To change hotspot settings, press the Menu soft button when using the 
3G Mobile Hotspot app. (You have to stop the service first.) Choose 
Advanced and then choose Wifi AP Mode. You can change the device 
name, security level, password, and channel. Touch the Save button to 
confirm the new settings.

Part III: Beyond Telephone Communications 
Turning on Wi-Fi
The cellular network’s data connection is handy, mostly because it’s available 
(almost) all over. For faster network communications, you can set up your 
Droid 2 to communicate with a wireless computer network, or Wi-Fi. It’s the 
same method used by desktop computers and laptops for hooking up to the 
Internet.
To turn on the Droid 2 Wi-Fi network, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Home screen, press the Menu soft button.
 
2. Choose Settings.
 
3. Choose Wireless & Networks.
 
4. Choose Wi-Fi.
 
 A green check mark appears by the Wi-Fi option, indicating that the 
phone’s Wi-Fi capabilities are now activated. If you’ve configured the 
phone to automatically connect to a nearby wireless network, the 
network name appears on the screen.
A helpful shortcut for turning on Wi-Fi is to use the Power Control widget, 
shown in Figure 14-1. This widget is preinstalled on the second Home screen, 
to the left of the main Home screen. Touch the Wi-Fi button and the Droid 2 
turns on its Wi-Fi capabilities.

 Chapter 14: Network Your Droid 2
See the next section for information on accessing a Wi-Fi network.
 
✓ Turning on Wi-Fi places an extra drain on the battery. So:
 
✓ Don’t forget to turn off Wi-Fi when you’re out of range or just out and 
about. That way, you save battery power (not a lot, but some).
 
✓ The Power Control widget (refer to Figure 14-1) is a collection of four 
individual Motorola widgets. A second Power Control widget, available 
under the Android Widgets category, also features a button for adjusting 
screen brightness.
 
✓ Also see Chapter 23 for information on prolonging battery life.
Accessing a Wi-Fi network
Turning on the phone’s Wi-Fi access is only the first part of connecting to a 
wireless network. The next step is joining the network. Just as you would do 
on a computer, you need to hunt down the wireless network by name and, 
optionally, input a password. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Press the Menu soft button while viewing the Home screen.
 
2. Choose Settings.
 
3. Choose Wireless & Networks.
 
4. Ensure that Wi-Fi is on.
 
 A green check mark must appear next to the Wi-Fi option.
 
5. Choose Wi-Fi Settings.
 
 You see a list of Wi-Fi networks displayed, as shown in Figure 14-2. 
If no wireless network is displayed, you’re sort of out of luck regarding 
wireless access from your current location.
 
6. Choose a wireless network from the list.
 
 In Figure 14-2, I chose the Imperial Wambooli network, which is my office 
network.
 
7. Optionally, type the network password.
 
 Touch the Password text box to see the onscreen keyboard.
 
 Touch the Show Password check box so that you can see what you’re 
typing; some of those network passwords can be long.

 Chapter 14: Network Your Droid 2
Some wireless networks don’t broadcast their names, which adds security 
but also makes accessing them more difficult. In those cases, choose the Add 
Wi-Fi Network command (refer to Figure 14-2) to manually add the network. 
You need to input the network name, or SSID, and the type of security. You 
also need the password, if one is used. You can obtain this information from 
the guy with the pierced nose who sold you coffee, or from whoever is in 
charge of the wireless network at your location.
 
✓ Not every network has a password.
 
✓ Some public networks are open to anyone, but you have to use the 
Browser app to find a login page that lets you access the network: 
Simply browse to any page on the Internet and the login page shows up.
 
✓ The phone automatically remembers any Wi-Fi network it’s connected to 
as well as that network password.
 
✓ If the network password has changed you need to update the Droid 2: 
Long-press the Wi-Fi network name (refer to Figure 14-2) and choose 
the Modify Network command from the pop-up menu. You can input the 
new password on the next screen.
 
✓ To disconnect from a Wi-Fi network, simply turn off Wi-Fi on the phone. 
See the preceding section.
The VPN connection
Honestly, if you don’t know what a VPN is, you 
don’t need to bother with the VPN connection. 
But when you’re at an organization that uses a 
virtual private network, you can use the Droid 2 
to access information on that network from your 
phone.
After opening the Settings icon, choose 
Wireless & Networks, VPN Settings, and then 
Add VPN. Type the name of your VPN and then 
fill in the complex instructions provided to you 
by the VPN manager at your organization. Or, 
just feign frustration and have someone else 
configure the phone. When you’re done, press 
the Menu soft button and choose the Save 
command.
To connect with a VPN, choose Wireless & 
Networks from the Settings screen and then 
choose VPN Settings. Choose the VPN you’ve 
already set up and then touch the Connect 
button.

Part III: Beyond Telephone Communications 
 
✓ A Wi-Fi network is faster than a cellular data network, so it makes sense 
to connect with Wi-Fi whenever you can.
 
✓ Unlike a cellular data network, a Wi-Fi network’s broadcast signal goes 
only so far. My advice is to use Wi-Fi whenever you plan to remain in one 
location for a while. If you wander too far away, your phone loses the 
signal and is disconnected.
Bluetooth Gizmos
One type of computer network you can confuse yourself with is Bluetooth. 
It has nothing to do with the color blue or any dental problems. Bluetooth is 
simply a wireless protocol for communication between two or more gizmos.
The primary way Bluetooth is used on a cell phone is by using a pair of those 
wireless earphones you see stuck on people’s heads. Those people must 
think they’re being all high-tech and cool, but they look like they have tiny 
staplers stuck to their earlobes. They also look like they’re talking with 
invisible people, so stay clear!
Activating Bluetooth
You must turn on the phone’s Bluetooth networking before you can use one 
of those Borg-earpiece implants and join the ranks of walking nerds. Here’s 
how to turn on Bluetooth for the Droid 2:
 
1. From the Applications Tray, choose Settings.
 
2. Choose Wireless & Networks.
 
3. Choose Bluetooth.
 
 Or, if a little green check mark already appears by the Bluetooth option, 
Bluetooth is already on.
You can also turn on Bluetooth by using the Power Control widget (refer to 
Figure 14-1). Just touch the Bluetooth button to turn it on.
To turn off Bluetooth, repeat the steps in this section.
 
 
✓ When Bluetooth is on, the Bluetooth status icon appears, as shown in 
the margin.

191
 Chapter 14: Network Your Droid 2
 
✓ Activating Bluetooth on the Droid 2 can quickly drain the battery. Be 
mindful to use Bluetooth only when necessary, and remember to turn it 
off when you’re done.
Using a Bluetooth device
To make the Bluetooth connection between the Droid 2 and a set of those 
“I’m so cool” earphones, you need to pair the devices. That way, the Droid 2 
picks up only your earphone and not anyone else’s.
To pair the phone with a headset, or any other Bluetooth gizmo, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Ensure that Bluetooth is on.
 
2. Turn on the Bluetooth headset.
 
3. Choose Settings from the Applications Tray.
 
4. Choose Wireless & Networks.
 
5. Choose Bluetooth Settings.
 
6. Ensure that a check mark appears by the Discoverable option.
 
7. Choose Scan for Devices.
 
8. If necessary, press the main button on the Bluetooth gizmo.
 
 The main button is the one you use to answer the phone. You may have 
to press and hold the button.
 
 Eventually, the device should appear on the screen,
 
9. Choose the device.
 
10. If necessary, input the device’s passcode.
 
 It’s usually a four-digit number, and quite often it’s simply 1234.
And now, the device is connected. You can stick it in your ear and press its 
main Answer button when the phone rings.
By the way, when a Bluetooth device is on and paired with the phone, the 
notification light (on the front of the Droid 2) flashes blue for an incoming call.

192
Part III: Beyond Telephone Communications 
 
 After you’ve answered the call (by pressing the main Answer button on the 
earphone), you can chat away. The Call in Progress notification icon is blue 
for a Bluetooth call, as shown in the margin.
If you tire of using the Bluetooth headset, you can touch the Bluetooth button 
on the touchscreen to use the Droid 2 speaker and microphone. (Refer to 
Figure 5-2, in Chapter 5, for the location of the Bluetooth button.)
 
✓ You can turn the Bluetooth earphone on or off after it has been paired. 
As long as Bluetooth is on, the Droid 2 instantly recognizes the earphone 
when you turn it on.
 
 
✓ The Bluetooth status icon changes when a device is paired. The new 
icon is shown in the margin.
 
✓ You can unpair a device by long-pressing the icon for the Bluetooth 
headset on the main Bluetooth screen. Choose the Unpair command.
 
✓ Turning on Discovery (refer to Step 6 in the preceding step list) isn’t 
necessary when pairing your Droid 2 with a Bluetooth headset.
 
✓ Don’t forget to turn off the earpiece when you’re done with it. The 
earpiece has a battery, and it continues to drain when you forget to turn 
the thing off.

s the Droid 2 merely a cell phone? I think not! 
The closest gizmo it resembles is the tricorder 
from Star Trek. It’s the gadget Mr. Spock toted 
around, wearing it like a party purse. When the 
science ofﬁ cer needed to gather information, he 
whipped out his tricorder and instantly knew 
every teensy scientiﬁ c fact about everything 
around him, including where the bad guys were 
and where Captain Kirk could ﬁ nd booze and 
space women.
The Droid 2 may not help you score with green 
aliens, but it does more than other mortal cell 
phones can do. Though it can’t ﬁ nd where the 
Klingons are hiding, it can help you ﬁ nd a gas sta-
tion or sushi bar or your friend Brad’s house. The 
Droid 2 can take pictures, record videos, play 
music, set your schedule, wake you in the morn-
ing, and more. All that stuff is covered in this part

T
he air smelled great. After six weeks beneath the Earth, inside the 
cramped Mole Machine, our party was happy to be aboveground, 
outside, and in the warm sun.
As Dr. Praetorius tended to the Mole Machine, I overheard 
Benjamin inquire about the location of the nearest 
Italian restaurant. Before Susan could berate him for 
his one-track, stomach-fueled mind, I whipped out 
my Droid 2.
“Why,” I exclaimed, “the nearest Italian restaurant 
is just three blocks from our present location. 
Indeed, the good people who frequent Google Maps 
have given it five stars. Let’s eat.” And the crew 
beamed with approval.
Basic Map
I would guess that the biggest blessing from using the amazing 
Droid 2 Maps app is that you no longer have to hang your head in shame 
over not being able to refold a map. Yep — the Maps app involves no folding 
whatsoever. Instead, it charts the entire country, including freeways, highways, 
roads, streets, avenues, drives, bike paths, addresses, businesses, and points 
of interest. The Maps app is incredible.

Using the Maps app
You start the Maps app by choosing Maps from the Applications Tray. If 
you’re starting the app for the first time, you can read its What’s New screen; 
touch the OK button to continue.
The Droid 2 communicates with global positioning system (GPS) satellites, 
cell towers, Wi-Fi hotspots, and various pagan gods to hone in on your 
current location. It’s shown on the map, similar to the one in Figure 15-1. The 
position is accurate to within a given range, as indicated by the blue circle.

Here are some fun things you can do when viewing the basic street map:
Zoom in: To make the map larger (to move it closer), touch the Zoom In 
button, double-tap the screen, or spread your fingers on the touchscreen.
Zoom out: To make the map smaller (to see more), touch the Zoom Out 
button or pinch your fingers on the touchscreen.
Pan and scroll: To see what’s to the left or right or at the top or bottom of 
the map, drag your finger on the touchscreen; the map scrolls in the direction 
you drag your finger.
The closer you zoom in to the map, the more detail you see, such as street 
names, address block numbers, and businesses and other sites — but no tiny 
people.
 
 To see a satellite overlay on the map, press the Menu soft button, choose 
Layers, and then choose Satellite. The map image reloads, showing the satel-
lite image on the map background, similar to what you see in Figure 15-2.

and then Satellite.
 
✓ The Droid 2 uses GPS, the global positioning system. It’s the same 
technology used by car navigation toys as well as by handheld GPS 
gizmos.
 
 
✓ When the Droid 2 is using GPS, you see the GPS Is On status icon 
appear.
 
 
✓ The compass arrow (refer to Figure 15-1) shows in which direction the 
phone is pointing.
 
✓ You can always go back to showing your current location on the map by 
pressing the Menu soft button and choosing the My Location command.
 
✓ You can add a Traffic layer by pressing the Menu soft button and 
choosing Layers and then Traffic. The Traffic information isn’t available 
everywhere, however.
 
✓ Also see the later section “Locating your address,” for details about the 
Street View feature.
 
✓ The Droid 2 warns you when various applications access the phone’s 
Location feature. The warning is nothing serious — the phone is just 
letting you know that software will access the phone’s physical location. 
Some folks may view that action as an invasion of privacy; hence the 
warnings. I see no issue with letting the phone know where you are, but 
I understand that not everyone feels that way. If you’d rather not share 
location information, simply decline access when prompted.
Useless trivia about the Traffic layer
The Traffic layer generated by the Maps app on 
the Droid 2 doesn’t rely on the same traffic infor-
mation you get from your local radio station. 
No, the app uses a much more clever method: 
Basically, Google uses information from your 
phone to determine where you are, which 
direction you’re heading, and how fast you’re 
moving. This information is compared with other 
Android phone users near you. Based on that 
data, the Google computers create a respect-
able picture of how traffic is flowing around you. 
That information is then used to generate the 
Traffic layer for the Maps app.

Spiffing up the map with Labs
The Maps app becomes more interesting and conveys more information 
when you employ the Labs feature. You might find handy the additions that 
Labs makes to the map, or you might find them annoying. Follow these steps 
to figure out whether you enjoy the Labs additions:
 
1. Open the Maps app.
 
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
 
3. Choose More.
 
4. Choose Labs.
 
 You see a list of options you can add to the Map display. The app has 
quite a few of them, and descriptions are provided in the list.
 
5. Choose a Labs item to add to the map.
 
 The item is added right away, and you can play with it or see it in action.
The number and type of options available on the Labs menu changes as 
Google modifies and updates available features. Eventually, some Labs 
options, such as Traffic, make it to the big-time. Other options disappear 
altogether. My advice is to check the Labs list often to see what’s up.
 
 The Android Market app Compass also serves as a virtual compass for the 
Droid 2. See Chapter 20 for more information on the Android Market.
The Droid 2 Is Your Copilot
The best way to put the Maps app to work is when you’re lost or looking 
for something. You can use Maps to locate people, places, and things. After 
they’ve been found, your phone tells you how to get there, turn by turn. So, 
even when you don’t know where you are or where you’re going, the Droid 2 
can help.
Locating your address
The Maps app shows your location as a compass arrow on the screen. But 
where is that? I mean, if you need to phone a tow truck, you can’t just say, 
“I’m the blue triangle on the orange slab by the green thing.”

Well, you can say that, but it probably won’t do any good.
To find your current street address, or any street address, long-press a 
location on the Maps screen. Up pops a bubble, similar to the one shown in 
Figure 15-3, that gives your approximate address.
Figure 15-3: Finding an address.
If you touch the address bubble (refer to Figure 15-3), you see a screen full of 
interesting things you can do, as shown in Figure 15-4.
The What’s Nearby command displays a list of nearby businesses or points of 
interest, some of them shown on the screen (refer to Figure 15-4) and others 
available by touching the What’s Nearby command.
Choose the Search Nearby item to use the Search command to locate 
businesses, people, or points of interest near the given location.
The Report a Problem command doesn’t connect you with the police; 
instead, it’s used to send information back to Google regarding an improper 
address or another map malfunction.
What’s really fun to play with is the Street View command. Choosing this 
option displays the location from a 360-degree perspective. In Street View, 
you can browse a locale, pan and tilt, or zoom in on details to familiarize 
yourself with an area, for example — whether you’re familiarizing yourself 
with a location or planning a burglary.
 
 Press the Back button to return to regular Map view from Street view.

Look for a specific addresses
To locate an address, type it into the Search box; for example:
1600 Pennsylvania Ave., Washington, D.C. 20006
Touch the Search button on either the onscreen or sliding keyboard and that 
location is then shown on the map. The next step is getting directions, which 
you can read about in the later section “Getting directions.”
 
✓ You don’t need to type the entire address. Often times, all you need is 
the street number and street name and then either the city name or zip 
code.
 
✓ If you omit the city name or zip code, the Droid 2 looks for the closest 
matching address near your current location.
Look for a type of business or restaurant or point of interest
You may not know an address, but you know when you crave sushi or 
Tex-Mex or perhaps Ethiopian food. Maybe you need a hotel or gas station. 
To find a business entity or a point of interest, type its name in the Search 
box; for example:
Movie theater
This command flags movie theaters on the current Maps screen or nearby.
 
Specify your current location, as described earlier in this chapter, to find 
locations near you. Otherwise, the Maps app looks for places near the area 
you see on the screen.
Or, you can be specific and look for businesses near a certain location by 
specifying the city name, district, or zip code, such as
Italian 92123
After typing this command and touching the Search button, you see a 
smattering of Italian restaurants found in my old neighborhood in San Diego 
and similar to the one shown in Figure 15-5.
To see more information about a result, touch its cartoon bubble, such as the 
one for Filippi’s Pizza Grotto, shown in Figure 15-5. The screen that appears 
offers details, plus perhaps even a Web site address and phone number. 
You can press the Get Directions button (refer to Figure 15-4) to get driving 
directions; see the later section “Getting directions.”

✓ Use the Zoom controls or spread your fingers to zoom in to the map.
 
✓ You can create a contact for the location, keeping it as a part of your 
Contacts list: After touching the location balloon, choose the command

Look for a contact’s location
You can hone in on where your contacts are located by using the map. This 
trick works when you’ve specified an address for the contact — either home 
or work or another location. If so, the Droid 2 can easily help you find that 
location or even give you directions.
 
 The key to finding a contact’s location is the little pushpin icon, shown in the 
margin. Anytime you see that icon in a contact’s information, you can touch 
it to view the location by using the Maps app.
Getting directions
One command associated with locations on the map is Get Directions. Here’s 
how to use it:
 
1. Touch a location’s cartoon bubble displayed by an address, a contact, 
or a business, or from the result of a map search.
 
 
2. From the list of options, choose the Get Directions command or touch 
the Get Directions button.
 
 
 You may be asked whether you want to navigate or get directions. If you 
choose Navigate, the Droid 2 goes into Navigation mode; refer to the 
next section.
 
 When you choose Get Directions, you see an input screen, similar to the 
one shown in Figure 15-6. The Droid 2 already has chosen your current 
location (shown as My Location in the figure) as the starting point, 
and the location you searched for, or are viewing on the map, as the 
destination.

3. To change the start point, touch the button to the right of the Start 
Point text box (refer to Figure 15-6).
 
 Or, you can type a starting point.
 
4. To change the destination, touch the button to the right of the 
Destination text box (refer to Figure 15-6).
 
5. Choose your method of transportation: car, public transportation, 
bicycle, or walking.
 
 Not all transportation options are available for all locations.
 
6. Touch the Go button.
 
 A list of directions appears on the phone’s screen.
 
7. Follow the directions to get where you want to go.
The directions appear as a list, which you can follow line by line.
You can choose the Show on Map command to view your trail on the map. 
Zoom in to see more detail.
To remove the navigation route from the screen, press the Menu soft button 
and choose More and then Clear Map. The sliding keyboard shortcut for the 
Clear Map command is Menu+C.
You can also choose the Navigate option, which lets your phone dictate the 
list of directions to you as you travel. See the next section.
Navigating to your destination
When you’d rather not see a list of directions to reach a destination, you can 
activate the Droid 2 Navigation mode. In that mode, the phone displays an 
interactive map that shows your current location and turn-by-turn directions 
for reaching your final location. Navigation mode also dictates verbally how 
far you should go and when to turn, for example, and gives you other nagging 
advice — just like a backseat driver, albeit an accurate one.
 
 To use Navigation, choose the Navigation option from any list of directions. 
Or, touch the Navigation icon, shown in the margin.
You can also start the Droid 2 Navigation mode directly by choosing the 
Navigation app from the Applications Tray. Opening the Navigation app 
displays a list of options for choosing a destination: You can speak or type 
a destination, choose a destination from your Contacts list, or navigate to a 
starred location. A list of locations you’ve recently looked up also appears, 
for your convenience.

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
After choosing Navigation, sit back and have the phone dictate your 
directions. You can simply listen, or just glance at the phone for an update of 
where you’re heading.
 
 
✓ To stop Navigation, press the Menu soft button and choose the Exit 
Navigation command.
 
✓ When you’re using the Droid 2 in the car dock, the command to access 
the Maps app’s navigation feature is My Location.
 
✓ When you tire of hearing the Navigation voice, press the Menu soft 
button and choose the Mute command.
 
✓ I refer to the navigation voice as Gertrude.
 
✓ The neat thing about Navigation is that whenever you screw up, a new 
course is immediately calculated.
 
✓ A direct link to the Navigation app is on the Car Dock screen — handy 
for when you’re using the Droid 2 in a car dock in your automobile.
 
✓ The Navigation app is beta software. It may change, and many of its 
features may not be available. I recommend, therefore, that you use the 
Maps app for navigating to your destination.
 
✓ In Navigation mode, the phone uses a lot of battery power. The phone 
doesn’t dim when you travel long distances; the touchscreen remains 
active. Voice commands also put a drain on battery life. See Chapter 23 
for more information on maintaining the phone’s battery.
Adding a navigation shortcut to the Home screen
 
When you visit certain places often — such as home — you can save yourself 
the time you would spend repeatedly inputting navigation information, by 
creating a navigation shortcut on the Home screen. Here’s how:
 
1. Long-press a blank part of the Home screen.
 
2. From the pop-up menu, choose Shortcuts.
 
3. Choose Directions & Navigation.
 
4. Type a contact name, address, destination, or business in the text box.
 
 As you type, suggestions appear in a list. You can choose a suggestion 
to save yourself some typing.
 
5. Choose a traveling method.
 
 Your options are car, public transportation, bicycle, and on foot.

6. Scroll down a bit to type a shortcut name.
 
7. Choose an icon for the shortcut.
 
8. Touch the Save button.
 
 The Navigation shortcut is placed on the Home screen.
To use the shortcut, simply touch it on the Home screen. Instantly, the Maps 
app starts and enters Navigation mode, steering you from wherever you are 
to the location referenced by the shortcut.
 
✓ See Chapter 22 for additional information on creating Home screen 
shortcuts.
 
✓ I keep all navigation shortcuts in one place, on the first Home screen to 
the right.
Where are your friends?
One Google Maps feature is Latitude, a social 
network program that lets you share your 
physical location with your friends, also 
assumed to be using Latitude. Being able 
to more easily know where your friends are 
makes it possible to meet up with them — or, I 
suppose, to avoid them. It’s all up to you.
To join Latitude, you press the Menu soft button 
when viewing a map and then choose the Join 
Latitude command. If you have the Latitude app, 
you can use it to directly access Latitude. (The 
app is just a shortcut to the Maps app.)
After opening Latitude, read the information 
and then touch the Allow & Share button to 
continue. If you don’t see the Join Latitude 
command, you’ve already joined; start Latitude 
by choosing the Latitude command.
To make Latitude work, you need to add 
friends to it, and those friends need to use it. 
After adding Latitude friends, you can share 
your location with them as well as view their 
locations on a map. You can also chat with 
Google Talk, send them email, get directions to 
their location, and do other interesting things.
To disable Latitude, press the Menu soft button 
when Latitude is active and choose the Privacy 
command. Choose the option Turn Off Latitude.

A Thousand Words
In This Chapter
▶ Using the phone’s camera
▶ Taking a still picture
▶ Adding picture effects
▶ Looking at the picture you just shot
▶ Shooting video with the phone
▶ Previewing your video
T
he old adage goes that a picture is worth a thousand words. That is, 
unless you’re working for a magazine, in which case the rates they pay 
authors and photographers are not correlated.
Among your phone’s many abilities worthy of boasting about 
is its capacity as both a still camera and video recorder. 
No longer do you need to fret about not having a camera 
with you. As long as you’re carrying your Droid 2, you 
can capture the moment or record the event. This 
chapter explains how it all works.
The Droid 2 Has a Camera
As a resident of the Digital Century, you most likely 
always have your cell phone with you. Consider it a 
bonus that the cell phone, your Droid 2, can double 
as a camera. It may not be perfect, but it’s handy — 
especially when you see leprechauns dancing with 
elephants and need a picture as proof or else no one will ever 
believe you.

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
Taking a picture
To use your Droid 2 phone as a camera, you need to know that the back of 
the phone holds the lens. To take a picture, you need to hold the phone away 
from your face, which I hear is hell to do when you wear bifocals. Before 
doing that, start the Camera app.
Summon the Camera app from the Applications Tray. After starting the 
Camera app, you see the main Camera screen, as illustrated in Figure 16-1.
Boring details
Shutter button
Camera controls hidden here
Focus square
Figure 16-1: Your phone as a camera.
To take a picture, point the camera at the subject and touch the Shutter 
button, found on the right or top side of the Droid 2, depending on whether 
you’re taking a portrait or landscape photograph. (Refer to Figure 1-2, in 
Chapter 1, for the physical shutter button’s location.)
Press the button lightly to adjust focus and ready the flash; press the shutter 
button firmly to snap the picture.
For a second, the picture you just snapped appears on the phone’s 
touchscreen. You see a prompt that tells you to touch the screen for more 
options. Here are those options:
Share: A menu of sharing options is presented. See Chapter 17 for 
specific information on what (and how) you can share the image you 
just took.
Set As: You can choose to make the image your Droid 2 wallpaper (its 
Home screen background) or assign the image to a contact.

Quick Upload: Choose this item to instantly send the image to your 
online photo-sharing album at the Picasa Web site (if you’ve configured 
the Droid 2 to share images with Picasa).
Delete: The image gets tossed into the digital dustbin and you can try 
again.
If you don’t touch the screen to see the options, the phone returns to Camera 
mode and you can take more pictures.
 
✓ As on other digital cameras, the shutter doesn’t snap instantly when you 
shoot the picture: The camera takes a moment to focus, the flash may go 
off, and then you hear the shutter sound effect.
 
✓ The camera doesn’t take a moment to focus if you first press the shut-
ter button lightly to focus the image and then press the button firmly to 
snap the picture.
 
✓ You can zoom in or out by pressing the Volume Down or Volume Up 
buttons, respectively. Because the zoom is a digital zoom, the image is 
magnified, as opposed to an optical zoom, which is done by adjusting 
the camera’s lens.
 
✓ If you plan to take a lot of pictures, consider placing a shortcut to the 
Camera app on the Home screen. See Chapter 22 for details.
 
✓ The phone can be used as a camera in either landscape or portrait 
orientation, though the phone’s controls and gizmos are always 
presented in landscape format (refer to Figure 16-1).
 
✓ The camera focuses automatically, though you can drag the focus 
square around the touchscreen to specifically adjust the focus (refer to 
Figure 16-1).
 
✓ You can take as many pictures with your Droid 2 as you like, as long as 
you don’t run out of storage for them on the phone’s MicroSD card.
 
✓ You can use the Gallery to manage images and delete the ones you don’t 
want. See Chapter 17 for more information about the Gallery.
 
✓ The Droid 2 not only takes a picture but also keeps track of where you 
were located on Planet Earth when you took it. See Chapter 17 for 
information on reviewing a photograph’s location.
 
✓ If your pictures appear blurry, ensure that the camera lens on the back 
of the Droid 2 isn’t dirty.
 
✓ Refer to Figure 1-3, in Chapter 1, for the location of the camera on the 
back of the Droid 2.
 
✓ The Droid 2 stores pictures in the JPEG image file format. Images are 
stored in the DCIM/Camera folder on the MicroSD card; they have the 
JPG filename extension.

Adjusting the camera
Your Droid 2 is more phone than camera — still, it has various camera 
adjustments you can make. Some adjustment controls are found on the 
screen when the Camera app first starts, as shown in Figure 16-2. Others are 
found by pressing the Menu soft button when using the Camera app.

taking certain types of pictures. After touching the Scenes button, swipe the 
options left or right. Choose one to configure the camera to, ideally, take that 
type of picture.

Flash Mode: Setting the camera’s flash mode is done by choosing the Flash 
command, shown in Figure 16-2. The camera has three flash modes:
Auto Flash: In this mode, the camera determines whether the flash goes 
off. Sometimes it does, such as when it’s dark, and sometimes it doesn’t, 
such as when you’re taking a picture of the sun.
Flash On: The flash always blinds your victims.
Flash Off: The flash never goes off, even in the dark.
Picture Mode: Set options for how to use the camera by pressing the Menu 
soft button and choosing Picture Modes. You can choose from four ways to 
use the camera, as described in Figure 16-3.

The Panorama Assist option helps you take multiple images that can be laid 
out in a panorama, either vertically or horizontally. When that option is set, 
the camera helps you point the camera in the right direction and at the right 
position to line up the panoramic shots.
 
✓ The Droid 2 camera comes with a self-portrait feature. To activate it, 
press the Menu soft button while using the camera, and then choose 
Picture Modes and then Self Portrait. Turn the phone around so that the 
camera is pointing at your face, press firmly on the shutter button, and 
pray. You need to pray because the Droid 2 may or may not find your 
face and the light from the flash will blind you while it’s doing so.
 
✓ To help the Droid 2 camera take better pictures of people (or yourself), 
activate the face detection feature: Press the Menu soft button when 
using the Camera. Choose Settings and then choose Face Detection to 
place a green check mark by that item.
 
✓ You can force a flash by choosing Flash On mode. That way, dark 
objects in the foreground show up against a light background, such as 
when taking a picture of someone in front of a nuclear explosion.
Reviewing the picture
All pictures you take with your camera can be accessed using the Gallery 
program, which is covered in Chapter 17. Even so, right after you take a 
picture, you’re given a chance to review it and other, recent pictures.
To review the image you just took, touch the Previous Image button (refer to 
Figure 16-2). You see a “camera roll” of recent images. Touch your image to 
examine it more closely.
After the previous image is shown full-screen, you can examine it in detail: 
Double-tap or spread your fingers on the touchscreen to zoom in; double-tap 
or pinch the touchscreen to zoom out. Drag your finger to pan the image.
 
 To do something with the image, press the Menu soft button. You see a 
screen similar to the one shown in Figure 16-4. (If you see a different menu 
appear, you aren’t viewing the previous image; see Chapter 17 for more 
information on using the Gallery app.)

✓ Deleting an image frees up the space it used on the phone’s MicroSD 
card.
 
✓ There’s no easy or obvious way to undelete an image, so be careful! In 
fact:
 
✓ I recommend that you do your deleting and other photo management 
duties by using the Gallery app, discussed in Chapter 17.
 
✓ By pressing the Share button, you can instantly share the image with 
friends on the Internet. You can share by email or text message or by 
using social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter, if you have 
the Droid 2 configured for use with those apps. Other options, such as 
sharing with the Picasa photo-sharing Web site, might also appear on 
the Share button’s list.

✓ The Print to Retail option on the Share button allows you to send the 
image to a photo-processing location near you, where it can be printed.
 
✓ How you share a photo depends on where you want the image to end 
up. See Chapter 9 for information on sending multimedia text messages; 
Chapter 10 covers the Email and Gmail programs, and Chapter 12 delves 
into Facebook and Twitter.
 
✓ Use the More button to access additional menu items. One such item, 
Set As, lets you instantly assign the photo as the Home page wallpaper 
(background image) or to set the image for a contact.
 
✓ The next time you’re face-to-face with a contact, remember to snap that 
person’s photo. Use the picture-review window’s Set As button to assign 
the image as the contact’s photo — with the contact’s permission, of 
course.
You Ought to Be on Video
When the action is hot, when you need to capture more than a moment (and 
maybe the sounds), you switch the Droid 2 camera into Video Capture mode. 
Doing so may not turn you into the next Martin Scorsese, because I hear he 
uses the Droid X to make his films.
Recording video
Video chores on the Droid 2 are handled by the Camcorder app, found on the 
Applications Tray. You can also get to Video mode by choosing the Switch To 
button when using the Droid 2 camera (refer to Figure 16-2).
The Camcorder app looks amazingly similar to the Camera app, with the 
addition of a time indicator, as illustrated in Figure 16-5.
Start shooting the video by pressing the phone’s shutter button — the same 
button used to take a picture. You can use the button on the screen (shown 
in Figure 16-5) or the shutter button on the Droid 2.
When recording, you see the red dot in the upper left corner of the screen 
light up and the recording time is noted (refer to Figure 16-5).
To stop recording, press the Shutter button again (either button).

Reviewing your movie
To review your video masterpiece, touch the screen in the Camera app and 
then touch the Previous Video button that appears in the lower left corner 
(similar to the picture shown earlier, in Figure 16-2). Choose your video from 
the list (it‘s the first one shown). Touch the big Play button (the triangle) to 
review the video.
You can use onscreen controls to pause or play the video as well as reverse 
and fast-forward the scene. The controls disappear as the video plays, but 
you can touch the screen to bring them back.
 
 When your video is done playing, you can press the Back soft button to 
return to the Camcorder app.
 
✓ The best way to review, manage, and delete the videos you’ve shot is by 
using the Gallery app. See Chapter 17.
 
✓ Also see Chapter 17 for information on publishing your video to 
YouTube.
 
✓ Though deleting a video frees up storage space on the phone’s MicroSD 
card, undeleting or recovering a deleted video is neither easy nor 
obvious.

T
o understand the need to carry around pictures, it helps to have 
children. If the need doesn’t hit you then (and you’re 
probably too overwhelmed), the onslaught of grandchildren 
will definitely turn you into one of those humans who 
constantly carries around pictures in their purse or 
wallet. Yeah, a load of pictures is something else to 
carry around — but not when you have a Droid 2. 
That’s because your phone is also your photo 
album.
The Droid 2 stores a copy of the digital pictures 
you snap, and the videos you record, right there 
inside the phone. It can also store pictures you’ve 
synchronized from your computer or from the 
Internet. It even has a nifty slideshow program that 
you can show people, if you first trap them in an 
elevator and get it stuck between floors. All of that 
(except for the elevator part) is covered in this chapter.

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
Behold the Image Gallery
Pictures and videos you shoot with your Droid 2 aren’t lost forever. Nope, 
they’re stored on the phone’s MicroSD card. After they’re stored or created 
there, you can access them from the Gallery app, where you can view them 
or edit them or do a number of other interesting things.
Perusing the Gallery
To access images and videos stored on your Droid 2, you start the Gallery 
app. You can find it on the Applications Tray.
When the Gallery opens, you see images organized into categories, as shown 
in Figure 17-1. The number and variety of categories you see depends on how 
you synchronize your phone with your computer or photo-sharing services 
on the Internet, such as Picasa.
Figure 17-1: The Gallery’s 
main screen.

221
 Chapter 17: Your Digital Photo Album
Touch a category to open it and view the pictures or videos it contains. When 
the Droid 2 is held in portrait (vertical) orientation, the media is presented in 
a humongous grid. You can scroll up and down by flicking your finger on the 
touchscreen. In landscape (horizontal) orientation, the images appear in a 
list that you can scroll left or right with a flick of your finger.
To view an image or a video, touch it with your finger. The image appears in 
full size on the screen, and you can tilt the phone to the left to see the image 
in another orientation.
You can view more images in the album by swiping your finger left and right.
 
 Videos appear with the Play Button icon, shown in the margin. Touching the 
icon plays the video.
 
 To return to the main category in the Gallery, press the Back soft button.
 
 
✓ To keep the Gallery handy, consider placing its shortcut icon on the 
Home screen. Refer to Chapter 22.
 
✓ Refer to Chapter 11 for information on downloading photos from the 
Web.
 
✓ See Chapter 13 for more information about doubleTwist, which can be 
used to copy images and videos from your computer to the Droid 2.
 
✓ When previewing an image, you can double-tap the screen to zoom in 
and then double-tap again to zoom back out.
 
 
✓ To run a slideshow of the photos in an album, touch the Slideshow 
button, shown in the margin. The slideshow starts, displaying one image 
after another.
 
✓ Specify slideshow options by pressing the Menu soft button and 
choosing Settings. A screen full of options appears, which helps you set 
various aspects of the slideshow presentation.
Finding an image location on a map
In addition to snapping a picture, the Droid 2 also saves the location where 
you took the picture. That information is obtained from the phone’s GPS, 
the same tool used to find your location on a map. In fact, you can use the 
information saved with a picture to see exactly where the picture was taken.

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
For example, Figure 17-2 shows the location where I took the image shown 
in Figure 16-1 (in Chapter 16). That location was saved by the phone’s GPS 
technology and is available as part of the picture’s data.
Figure 17-2: A picture’s location.
To see where you’ve taken a picture, follow these steps:
 
1. Summon the image in the Gallery.
 
 
2. Touch the Info button on the touchscreen.
 
 
 The Info button is shown in the margin. After you touch the button, 
information about the picture appears on the screen.
 
3. Choose Location.
 
 The spot where you took the picture appears in the Maps app.
 
4. Touch the Back button to return to the Gallery.
Not every image has location information. In some cases, the Droid 2 
cannot read the GPS to store the information. When that happens, location 
information is unavailable.
Working with pictures
 
 The Gallery serves as a way to manage the pictures stored on your Droid 2. 
To individually manipulate an image, summon it in the Gallery by touching 
the image, as described earlier in this chapter. Press the Menu soft button to 
see a slate of commands you can use to manipulate the image. Here’s what 
you can do:
Share an image: Send the image elsewhere using the Internet or a text 
message. See the later section “Sharing your pictures and videos” for details.

Delete an image: Touch the Delete button to remove the image you’re 
viewing. You’re prompted before the image is removed; touch the OK button 
to delete the image.
Use an image for a contact or as wallpaper: Touch the More button and 
choose the Set As command to apply the image you’re viewing to a contact 
or to set that image as the Home screen wallpaper (background).
The Gallery offers three simple image-editing commands:
Crop: Choose the Edit command and then the Crop command to slice out 
portions of an image, such as when removing an unwanted relative or a 
former paramour from a family portrait. Figure 17-3 illustrates how to use the 
cropping tool that appears on the screen. Choose the Save command to keep 
the portion of the image that dwells within the orange rectangle. Choose the 
Discard command to abandon any cropping and return to the Gallery.
Drag around the rectangle
Resize an edge
Portion of the image to keep
Keep changes and exit
Keep the image as-is
Figure 17-3: Working the crop thing.
Cropping an image doesn’t alter the original picture in the Gallery. Instead, a 
new image is created with the crop settings you’ve chosen.
Rotate left, rotate right: Choose the Edit command and then choose Rotate. 
Use the circle control on the touchscreen to reorient the image. Touch the 
Save button when you’re pleased with the results.

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
Additional editing commands are available. Find them by pressing the Menu 
soft button, choosing the Edit command, and then choosing Advanced 
Editing. I’m truly surprised at the variety and power of the available commands, 
some of which generally require the power of a full computer to accomplish.
 
Some images might not be available for editing, such as images imported into 
your phone from shared Picasa albums. Other, uneditable pictures may be 
stored in other albums on your Droid 2.
Tagging images
Because images contain visual information, searching and organizing images 
tend to be haphazard tasks. One method to help you keep your pictures and 
videos organized is to tag them.
A tag is simply a tidbit of text, short and punchy — for example, vacation, 
Grandma, 2009, Wisconsin, or exploding cupcake. By itself, a tag may seem 
useless, but the key to properly tagging an image is to apply more than one 
tag. An image tagged with all its descriptions — vacation, Grandma, 2009, 
Wisconsin, and exploding cupcake — is quite descriptive.
To apply a tag to an image in the Gallery, follow these steps:
 
1. Touch an image to view it by itself on the Droid 2 touchscreen.
 
 
2. Touch the Info button.
 
 
 If the Info button vanishes, just touch the screen again and it shows up.
 
 
 Lots of information about the image is displayed, similar to what’s 
shown in Figure 17-4.
 
3. Choose Tags.
 
4. Use either Droid 2 keyboard to type a tag.
 
 Single word tags work best. If you need to be more descriptive, add 
more tags.
 
 You can use tags later to search for images. So think of a tag that you 
would use to find the image if you were doing a search.
 
 As you type, you may see contact names appear. If so, choose that 
contact name to tag the contact in the image.
 
 
5. Touch the green plus-sign button to add another tag.
 
 
6. Touch the Done button when you’re finished tagging the image.

The tags you add appear on the image information screen, similar to the one

powerful Droid 2 Search command.
 
✓ By keeping tags succinct, you can easily sift and sort your images. For 
example, find all images from 2009 and then all birthday images from 
2009.
 
✓ Many picture-viewing or media management programs on your computer 
allow for tagging. The tags are usually kept with the picture information so 
that when you copy or share the images, the tags come along for the ride.
 
✓ Tagging works only when you remember to do it!

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
Share Your Pics and Vids with the World
It’s socially acceptable to share your phone’s images and videos by queuing 
things up and then handing your phone to another human for their enjoyment. 
For those friends and relatives you’d rather not interact with personally, you 
can choose to share the media on your phone in a more digital fashion on the 
Internet.
Refer to Chapter 13 for information on synchronizing and sharing information 
between the Droid 2 and your computer.
Sharing your pictures and videos
Occasionally, you stumble across the Share command when working with 
photos and videos in the Gallery. This command is used to distribute images 
and videos from your Droid 2 to your pals on the Internet.
The menu that appears when you choose the Share command contains 
various options for sharing media, similar to the one shown in Figure 17-5. 
You may see more or fewer items on the Share menu, depending on which 
software you have installed on your Droid 2, which Internet services you 
belong to, and which type of media is being shared.
The following sections describe some of the items you can choose from the 
menu and how the media is shared.
Bluetooth
Bluetooth is perhaps the most difficult way to share files, but it’s first alpha-
betically, so I’m forced to talk about it up front. Without boring you: Use a 
USB cable and directly connect the phone to a computer rather than use 
Bluetooth for sharing media. See Chapter 13.
The problem with file sharing using Bluetooth on the Droid 2 is that the 
devices can pair just fine. They don’t, however, connect: Your laptop or a 
second mobile phone may claim that the Droid 2 is lacking a service. Because 
this is a software-related issue, it might be repaired in the future. If so, tune 
into my Web site for updated information:

Figure 17-5: Sharing options 
for media.
Email and Gmail
After selecting one or more image or video, choose Email or Gmail from the 
Share menu to send the media files from your Droid 2 as a message attachment. 
Fill in the To, Subject, and Message text boxes as necessary. Touch the Send 
button to send the media.
 
✓ You may not be able to send video files as email attachments. That’s 
probably because some video files are humongous. They would not only 
take too long to send but also might be too big for the recipient’s inbox.
 
✓ As an alternative to sending large video files, consider uploading them to 
YouTube instead. See the later section “Uploading a video to YouTube.”

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
Facebook
To upload a mobile image to Facebook, choose the Facebook command from 
the Share menu. Optionally, type (or dictate) a caption. Touch the Upload 
button. Eventually, the media makes its way to Facebook, for all your friends 
to enjoy and make rude comments about.
 
✓ It helps to be signed into Facebook on your Droid 2 before you choose 
to share a picture or video.
 
✓ The Facebook option isn’t available for sharing videos.
Online Album
This item puzzled me, until I chose it and figured out that it’s another portal 
into the Picasa online photo-sharing Web site. Rather than use the Internet 
connection, however, the Online Album option sends the image to your 
Picasa account’s Drop Box folder by using MMS, or media attached to a text 
message. That feature makes this option ideal for situations when you need 
to upload a photo but an Internet connection isn’t available.
Photo Sharing
The Photo Sharing option is merely a shortcut to sending an image (not a 
video) to Facebook or your Picasa album. After choosing this option, you see 
a sharing screen from which you can choose Facebook or Picasa or add a 
sharing account, such as Photobucket or one of the other free online 
picture-sharing services.
I assume that at some point the Photo Sharing and Online Album options 
might be customizable. For example, they may allow you to send your Droid 
2 images to online photo-sharing Web sites other than Picasa.
Picasa
Perhaps the most sane way to share photos is to upload them to Google’s 
Picasa photo-sharing site. Heck, you probably already have a Picasa account 
synced with your phone, so this option is perhaps the easiest and most 
obvious to use. Here’s how it works:
 
1. View a picture in the Gallery.
 
2. Choose Picasa from the Share Picture Via menu (refer to Figure 17-5).
 
3. Type a caption.
 
4. Optionally, choose your Google account (if you have more than one).
 
5. Choose a Picasa album.
 
 You may need to scroll up the top part of the screen a bit to see the 
Album item, which might be hidden behind the onscreen keyboard.
 
6. Touch the Upload button to send the images.

WWW.EBOOK777.COM

229
 Chapter 17: Your Digital Photo Album
Because Picasa may automatically sync certain albums with your Droid 2, 
you can end up with two copies of the image on the phone. If so, you can 
delete the non-Picasa version of the image from its original gallery.
 
✓ Picasa is for sharing images only, not video.
 
✓ Your Google account automatically comes with access to Picasa. If you 
haven’t yet set things up, visit picasaweb.google.com to get started.
 
✓ You can share images stored on the Picasa Web site by clicking the 
Share button found above each photo album.
 
✓ To make a Picasa album public, on the Internet (preferably using your 
computer) choose the Edit➪Album Properties command, found just 
above the album. Choose Public from the pop-up menu, by the Visibility 
command in the Edit Album Information window.
Print to Retail
Here’s a crazy idea: Connect your phone to a local photo developer, such 
as Costco, and have it send your images electronically so that they can be 
printed. After choosing the Print to Retail option, you can do exactly that: 
The Droid 2 uses its GPS powers to locate a printer near you. You can then 
fill in the various forms to have your pictures sent and printed.
Text Messaging
Media can be attached to a text message, which then becomes the famous 
MMS, or multimedia, message, that I write about in Chapter 9. After choosing 
the Messaging sharing option, input the contact name or phone number to 
which you want to send the media. Optionally, type a brief message. Touch 
the Send button to send the message.
 
✓ Some images and videos may be too large to send as multimedia text 
messages.
 
✓ The Droid 2 may prompt you to resize an image to properly send it as an 
MMS message.
 
✓ Not every cell phone has the ability to receive multimedia text messages.
Twitter
Images are shared on the popular Twitter social networking site by saving 
the image on a Twitter image-sharing Web site and then tweeting the link to 
that image. It helps to have the Twitter app installed on your Droid 2 and for 
you to be logged in to that account before you use Twitter to share an image.
The Twitter app on the Droid 2 uses the TwitPic Web site to share images. 
After choosing the Twitter option for sharing, you see the TwitPic link in your 
tweet message. Type additional text (whatever will fit) and then touch the 
Update button to tweet the pic’s link.

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
YouTube
The YouTube sharing option appears when you’ve chosen to share a video 
from the Gallery. See the next section.
Uploading a video to YouTube
The best way to share a video is to upload it to YouTube. As a Google 
account holder, you also have a YouTube account. You can use the YouTube 
app on the Droid 2 along with your account to upload your phone’s videos to 
the Internet, where everyone can see them and make rude comments upon 
them. Here’s how:
 
1. Activate the Wi-Fi connection for your Droid 2.
 
 The best — the only — way to upload a video is to turn on the Wi-Fi 
connection, which is oodles faster than using the cell phone digital 
network. See Chapter 14 for information on how to turn on the Wi-Fi 
connection.
 
2. From the Applications Tray, choose the Gallery app.
 
3. View the video you want to upload.
 
 Or, simply have the video displayed on the screen.
 
 
4. Press the Menu soft button
 
 
5. Choose the Share command.
 
6. Choose YouTube.
 
7. Type the video’s title.
 
8. Touch the More Details button.
 
9. Optionally, type a description, specify whether to make the video 
public or private, add tags, or change other settings.
 
10. Touch the Upload button.
 
 You return to the Gallery and the video is uploaded. It continues to 
upload, even if the phone falls asleep.
To view your video, open the YouTube app in the Applications Tray and 
choose the My Account command. If you don’t see your recently uploaded 
video in the My Videos list, choose View All My Videos and find it there.
You can share your video by sending its YouTube Web page link to your pals. 
I confess that using a computer for this operation is easier than using your 
phone: Log in to YouTube on a computer to view your video. Use the Share 
button that appears near the video to share it via email, on Facebook, or 
elsewhere.

✓ YouTube often takes a while to process a video after it’s uploaded. 
Allow a few minutes to pass (longer for larger videos) before the video 
becomes available for viewing.
 
✓ Wi-Fi access drains battery power, so don’t forget to turn it off when you 
no longer need it after uploading your video.
 
✓ Upload is the official term to describe sending a file from your phone to 
the Internet.
 
✓ See Chapter 19 for more information on using YouTube on your Droid 2.

f you long to listen to your phone even when you’re not making a phone 
call, you can employ the Droid 2 as your portable music player. 
Enjoying music is another way you can while away your time with 
your phone, especially when you tire of watching videos on 
YouTube, playing games you download from the Android 
Market, texting, taking pictures or videos, or doing any 
of the other boring little things your phone does.
The Hits Keep On Coming
Your Droid 2 is ready to entertain you with music 
whenever you want to hear it. Simply summon the 
Music app, and choose tunes to match your mood. 
It’s truly blissful — well, until someone calls you and 
the Droid 2 ceases being a musical instrument and 
returns to being the ball-and-chain of the modern 
digital era.
Browsing your music library
Music Headquarters on your phone is the app named, oddly enough, Music. 
You can start the app by touching its icon found on the Applications Tray. 
Soon, you discover the main Music browsing screen, shown in Figure 18-1.

All music stored on your phone can be viewed in four categories:
Artists: Songs are listed by recording artist or group. Choose Artist to see 
the list of artists. Then choose a specific artist to see their albums. Choosing 
an album displays the songs for that album. Some artists may have only one 
song, not in a particular album.
Albums: Songs are organized by album. Choose an album to list its songs.
Songs: All songs are listed alphabetically.
Playlists: Only songs you’ve organized into playlists are listed by their 
playlist names. Choose a playlist name to view songs organized in that 
playlist.
These categories are merely ways that the music is organized — ways to 
make the music easier to find when you may know an artist’s name but not an 
album title or you may want to hear a song but not know who recorded it.

 Chapter 18: Music, Music, Music
A playlist is a list you create to organize songs by favorite, theme, or mood or 
whatever characteristic you want. The section “Organize Your Music,” later 
in this chapter, discusses playlists.
 
✓ Music is stored on the Droid 2 MicroSD card.
 
✓ The size of the MicroSD card limits the total amount of music that can 
be stored on your phone. Also, consider that storing pictures and videos 
on your phone horns in on some of the space that can be used to store 
music.
 
✓ See the later section “More Music” for information on putting music into 
your phone.
 
✓ Album artwork generally appears on imported music as well as on music 
you purchase online. If an album doesn’t have artwork, it cannot be 
manually added or updated.
 
✓ When the Droid 2 can’t recognize an artist, it uses the title Unknown 
Artist. It usually happens with music you copy manually to the Droid 2. 
Music that you purchase, or import or synchronize with a computer, 
generally retains the artist and album information. (Well, the information 
is retained as long as it was supplied on the computer or another original 
source.)
Playing a tune
To listen to music on the Droid 2, you first find a song in the library, as 
described in the preceding section, and then you touch the song title. The 
song plays in another window, as shown in Figure 18-2.
While the song is playing, you’re free to do anything else with the phone. In 
fact, the song continues to play even if the phone goes to sleep. You can just 
continue listening, and look cool, wherever you go, because you’re wearing 
ear buds and, obviously, you’re a with-it person because you have a portable 
music player.
After the song is done playing, the next song in the list plays. Touch the Song 
List button (refer to Figure 18-2) to review the songs in the list; you can even 
rearrange songs by dragging them in the list.
The next song doesn’t play if you have the Shuffle button activated (refer to 
Figure 18-2). In that case, the phone randomizes the songs in the list, so who 
knows which one is next?

✓ The volume is set by using the Volume buttons on the side of the phone: 
Up is louder, down is quieter.
 
 
✓ When you’re browsing your music library, you may see a green Play 
icon, similar to the one shown in the margin. This icon flags any song 
that’s playing or paused.

✓ Determining which song plays next depends on how you chose the song 
that’s playing. If you choose a song by artist, all songs from that artist 
play, one after the other. When you choose a song by album, that album 
plays. Choosing a song from the entire song list causes all songs in the 
phone to play.
 
✓ To choose which songs play after each other, create a playlist. See the 
section “Organize Your Music,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ After the last song in the list plays, the phone stops playing songs — 
unless you have Repeat on, in which case the list plays again.
 
 
✓ You can use the Droid 2 search abilities to help locate tunes in the 
phone’s music library. You can search by artist name, song title, or 
album. The key is to press the Search soft button when you’re using the 
Music app. Type all or part of the text you’re searching for and touch 
the Search button on the onscreen keyboard. Choose the song you want 
to hear from the list that’s displayed.
Turning your phone into a deejay
You need to do four things to make your Droid 2 the soul of your next shindig 
or soirée:
 
✓ Connect it to a stereo.
 
✓ Use the Shuffle command.
 
✓ Set the Repeat command.
 
✓ Provide plenty of drinks and snacks.
You can hook the Droid 2 to any stereo that has line inputs. You need, on one 
end, an audio cable that has a mini-headphone jack and, on the other end, an 
audio input that matches your stereo. Look for these cables at stores such as 
Radio Shack or any stereo store.
After your phone is connected, start the Music app and choose the party 
playlist you’ve created. If you want the songs to play in random order, 
choose the Shuffle command. The Shuffle button (refer to Figure 18-2) 
appears highlighted when that option is on.
 
You can also press the Menu soft button and choose the Party Shuffle 
command. After you activate Party Shuffle, all songs on your phone are 
played in random order. Depending on how eclectic your songs are, you 
might create an interesting party mood. When you’re done partying, press 
the Menu soft button and choose Party Shuffle Off.

You might also consider choosing the Repeat command so that all songs 
repeat after they’ve played.
Enjoy your party, and please drink responsibly.
Organize Your Music
A playlist is a collection of tunes you create. You build the list by combining 
songs from one album or artist or another — whatever music you have on 
your phone. You can then listen to the playlist and hear the music you want 
to hear. That’s how to organize music on your Droid 2.
Reviewing your playlists
Any playlists you’ve already created appear under the Playlists heading on 
the Music app’s main screen. Touching the Playlists heading displays your 
playlists, similar to the ones shown in Figure 18-3.
To listen to a playlist, long-press the playlist name and choose the Play 
command from the menu that appears.

Droid 2.

 Chapter 18: Music, Music, Music
You can also touch a playlist name to open the playlist and review the songs 
that are listed. Then you can choose any song from the list to start listening 
to that song.
 
A playlist is a helpful way to organize music when a song’s information may 
not have been completely imported into the Droid 2. For example, if you’re 
like me, you probably have a lot of songs by “Unknown Artist.” The quick way 
to remedy that situation is to name a playlist after the artist and then add 
those unknown songs to the playlist. The next section describes how it’s 
done.
Creating a playlist
To start a new playlist from scratch, you don’t just create an empty playlist 
and then add songs. That might be how things work on your computer, but 
not on the Droid 2. Instead, you need to start by selecting the first tune you 
want to put on the playlist. Follow these steps:
 
1. Play the song you want to use to start a new playlist.
 
 You don’t have to keep playing the song; feel free to pause the music 
after the song starts playing.
 
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose Add to Playlist.
 
4. Choose New.
 
5. Type the playlist name.
 
 Erase whatever silly text already appears in the input field. Type or 
dictate a new, better playlist name.
 
6. Touch the Save button.
 
 The new playlist is created and the song you were playing (refer to Step 
1) is added to the playlist.
A new playlist has only one song. That’s not much of a playlist, unless, of 
course, the song is by the Grateful Dead. To add more songs to a playlist, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Play the song you want to add to the playlist.
 
 You don’t have to keep playing the song; feel free to pause the music 
after the song starts playing.
 
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose the Add to Playlist command.

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
 
4. Choose an existing playlist.
 
 You may have to scroll down the list to see all your playlists.
You can continue adding songs to as many playlists as you like. Adding songs 
to a playlist doesn’t noticeably affect the storage capacity of the MicroSD 
card.
 
✓ Songs in a playlist can be rearranged: Use the tab on the far left end of 
the song’s title in the list to drag the song up or down.
 
✓ To remove a song from a playlist, long-press the song in the playlist and 
choose the command Remove from Playlist. Removing a song from a 
playlist doesn’t delete the song from your phone. (See the next section 
for information on deleting songs from the Music library.)
 
✓ To delete a playlist, long-press its name in the list of playlists. Choose 
the Delete command. Though the playlist is removed, none of the songs 
in the playlist has been deleted.
Deleting music
To purge unwanted music from your Droid 2, follow these brief, painless 
steps:
 
1. Locate the music that offends you.
 
2. Long-press the musical entry.
 
 If you don’t want to hear the music, locate the music in a list: Artists, 
Albums, or Songs.
 
3. Choose Delete.
 
 A warning message appears.
 
4. Touch the OK button.
 
 The music is gone. La, la, la, la: The music is gone.
As the warning says (before Step 4), the music is deleted permanently from 
the MicroSD card. By deleting music, you free up storage space, and you 
cannot recover any music you delete. If you want the song back, you have to 
reinstall it, sync it, or buy it again, as described in the next section.

More Music
The Droid 2 may have come with a smattering of tunes preinstalled, or it 
might have come empty. I don’t know which situation is worse: your tolerance 
of someone else’s oddball musical tastes or your enjoyment of silence. 
Obviously, there’s a need for more music, but where does this music come 
from? Well, there’s no need to whip out a pen and notebook or take up the 
guitar: You can import music from your computer or buy new music from the 
Amazon MP3 store.
 
✓ Music, like pictures and video, is stored on the phone’s MicroSD card. 
That card has only so much capacity. Though it would be nice to carry 
around all your music in the Droid 2, it’s just not practical, so be judicious 
when adding music to your phone.
 
✓ See Chapter 13 for more information on managing the MicroSD card.
Synchronizing music with your computer
Your computer is the equivalent of the 20th century stereo system — a 
combination tuner, amplifier, and turntable, plus all your records and CDs. If 
you’ve already copied your music collection to your computer, or if you use 
your computer as your main music storage system, you can share that music 
with the Droid 2.
In Windows, you can use Windows Media Player to synchronize music 
between your phone and the PC. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Connect the Droid 2 to the PC.
 
 
2. Pull down the USB notification.
 
3. Choose the item Windows Media Sync.
 
4. Touch the OK button.
 
5. On your PC, start the Windows Media Player.
 
 You can use most any media program, or “jukebox.” These steps are 
specific to Version 12 of Windows Media Player, though they’re similar 
to the steps you take in any media-playing program.

6. If necessary, click the Sync tab in Windows Media Player.
 
 The Droid 2 appears in the Sync list on the right side of Windows Media 
Player, as shown in Figure 18-4.

7. Drag to the Sync area the music you want to transfer to the Droid 2 
(refer to Figure 18-4).
 
8. Click the Start Sync button to transfer the music to the Droid 2.
 
 The Sync button may be located atop the list, as shown in Figure 18-4, or 
found on the bottom.
 
9. Close the Windows Media Player when you’re done transferring 
music.
 
 Or, you can keep the player open — whatever.
 
10. Unmount the Droid 2 from the PC’s storage system.
 
 Refer to Chapter 13 for specific unmounting instructions, also known as 
turning off USB storage.

 Chapter 18: Music, Music, Music
When you have a Macintosh, or you detest Windows Media Player, you can 
use the doubleTwist program to synchronize music between your Droid 2 and 
your computer. Refer to the section about synchronizing with doubleTwist in 
Chapter 13 for more information.
 
✓ You must mount the Droid 2 — specifically, its MicroSD card — into 
your computer’s storage system before you can synchronize music.
 
✓ The Droid 2 can store only so much music! Don’t be overzealous when 
copying over your tunes. In Windows Media Player (refer to Figure 18-4), 
a capacity thermometer thing shows you how much storage space is 
used and how much is available on your phone. Pay heed to that indicator!
 
✓ Windows Media Player complains when you try to sync the Droid 2 to 
more than one PC. If so, you’re warned after Step 6 in this section. It’s 
not a big issue: Just inform Windows Media Player that you intend to 
sync with the computer for only this session.
 
✓ You cannot use iTunes to synchronize music with the Droid 2.
 
✓ Though the USB connection is on for your phone, and the phone’s 
MicroSD card is mounted into the computer’s storage system, the 
Droid 2 cannot access the MicroSD card. That means you cannot play 
music (or look at photos or access Contacts, for example) while the 
MicroSD card is mounted.
 
✓ It’s also possible, though extremely unlikely, to manually add music to 
your phone. By manually, I mean mounting the Droid 2 into the computer’s 
storage system and then copying and pasting music files from your 
computer to the phone’s MicroSD card. The degree of insanity required 
to make this type of operation fun is so high that anyone attempting the 
procedure should immediately be sent to Congress.
Buying music at the Amazon MP3 store
You don’t have the music on your computer. You don’t even have the CD to 
burn into your computer! You can’t jam an old CD into the Droid 2! At this 
point, a normal person would begin to panic, but because you have this 
book, you will instead visit the Amazon MP3 store to buy the music you need 
for your phone.
 
Before running through the steps, you must have an Amazon account. If you 
don’t have one set up, use your computer to visit www.amazon.com and 
create one. You also need to keep a credit card on file for the account, which 
makes purchasing music with the Droid 2 work O so well.

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
Follow these steps to buy music for your phone:
 
1. Ensure that you’re using a Wi-Fi or high-speed digital network 
connection.
 
 When in doubt about the cellular data network, activate the phone’s 
Wi-Fi as described in Chapter 14. You can also refer to Chapter 14 for 
information on the various cellular data networks and their speeds.
 
2. From the Applications Tray, choose the Amazon MP3 app.
 
 The Amazon MP3 app connects you with the online Amazon music store, 
where you can search or browse for tunes to preview and purchase for 
your Droid 2.
 
3. Touch the Search button to begin your music quest.
 
 Or, you can browse the top-selling songs and albums or browse by 
category.
 
4. Type some search words, such as an album name, a song title, or an 
artist name.
 
 You can also dictate the search text. See Chapter 4 for more dictation 
information.
 
 Your search results appear, if any matches are found, as shown in 
Figure 18-5.

the Amazon MP3 store.

 Chapter 18: Music, Music, Music
 
5. Touch a result.
 
 If the result is an album, you see the contents of the album. Otherwise, a 
30-second audio preview plays.
 
 When the result is an album, choose a song in the album to hear the 
preview.
 
 Touch the song again to stop the preview.
 
6. To purchase the album or song, touch the big, orange button with the 
amount in it.
 
 For example, the big, orange button at the top of the list (refer to 
Figure 18-5) specifies $5.99.
 
 Touching the button changes the price into the word BUY.
 
7. Touch the word BUY.
 
8. If necessary, you may need to accept the license agreement.
 
 This step happens the first time you buy something from the Amazon 
MP3 store.
 
9. Log in to your Amazon.com account: Type your account name or 
email address and password.
 
 Your purchase is registered, account authorized, and download started. 
If they aren’t, touch the Retry button to try again.
 
10. Wait while the music downloads.
 
 Well, actually, you don’t have to wait: The music continues to download 
while you do other things on the phone.
No notification icon appears when the song or album has finished download-
ing. Notice, however, that the MP3 Store downloading icon vanishes from 
the notification part of the screen. It’s your clue that the new music is in the 
phone and ready for your ears.
 
✓ Amazon emails you a bill for your purchase. That’s your purchase 
record, so I advise you to be a good accountant and print it and then 
input it into your bookkeeping program or personal finance program at 
once!
 
✓ You can review your Amazon MP3 store purchases by pressing the 
Menu soft button in the MP3 Store app and choosing the Downloads 
command.
 
✓ You can also buy music using the doubleTwist program. Refer to 
Chapter 13 for more information on doubleTwist.

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
Your Phone Is a Radio
Though they’re not broadcast radio stations, some sources on the Internet — 
Internet radio — play music. You can listen to this Internet music if you put 
one of these two apps on your Droid 2:
 
✓ Pandora Radio
 
✓ StreamFurious
 
 Pandora Radio lets you select music based on your mood and customizes 
what you listen to according to your feedback. The app works like the 
Internet site www.pandora.com, in case you’re familiar with it.
 
 StreamFurious streams music from various radio stations on the Internet. 
Though not as customizable as Pandora, it uses less bandwidth.
Both apps are available at the Android Market. They’re free, though a paid, 
Pro version of StreamFurious exists.
 
✓ Various apps are also available at the Android Market that can turn 
your cell phone into an FM radio. I have nothing specific to recommend, 
mostly because the good apps aren’t free. But keep your eyes peeled for 
FM radio apps for your Droid 2.
 
✓ See Chapter 20 for more information about the Android Market.

A Clutch of Apps
In This Chapter
▶ Using the Calendar
▶ Checking your schedule
▶ Adding an event
▶ Using the Droid 2 as a calculator
▶ Setting alarms
▶ Searching for videos on YouTube
▶ Renting and buying movies
▶ Playing games
Your phone is limited in its abilities only by the software — the 
apps — it has, and the Droid 2 comes with a lot of apps. 
Too many to write about all in one book, in fact. Too many 
to try all at once. Yet just enough to keep the task of 
scrolling the Applications Tray just a notch above 
tedious.
Though other chapters cover some of the major 
apps tied into the secondary (nonphone) duties of 
the Droid 2, a few apps are still worthy of a look. 
Some are useful, some are for diversion, and some 
can be dangerously fun. They’re covered in this 
chapter.
An Appointment to Remember
Some people have date books. Others might write down appoint-
ments on business cards or on their palms. These methods might be 
effective, but they pale in comparison to the power of using your Droid 2 as 
your calendar and date keeper. Your phone can easily serve as a reminder 
of obligations due or delights to come. It all happens thanks to Google 
Calendar and the Calendar app on your phone.

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
Understanding the Calendar
The Droid 2 takes advantage of Google Calendar on the Internet. If you have 
a Google account (and I’m certain that you do), you already have Google 
Calendar. You can visit Google Calendar by using your computer to go to this 
Web page:
calendar.google.com
If necessary, log in using your Google account. You can use Google Calendar 
to keep track of dates or meetings or whatever else occupies your time. You 
can also use your phone to do the same thing, thanks to the Calendar app.
 
✓ I recommend that you use the Calendar app on your phone to access 
Google Calendar. It’s a better way to access your schedule on the 
Droid 2 than using the Browser app to get to Google Calendar on the Web.
 
✓ Also see the later section “No Need to Alarm You” for information on 
using the Alarm & Timer app to set alarms on the phone.
 
✓ The Droid 2 comes with a Calendar widget. It should appear on the first 
Home page to the left of the main Home page. If not, you can add the 
widget to the Home page. (It’s a Motorola widget.) The Calendar widget 
is useful for reminding you of upcoming appointments. See Chapter 22 
for details on adding widgets to the Home screen.
Browsing dates
To see your schedule or upcoming important events, or just to know which 
day of the month it is, summon the Calendar app. Touch the Launcher button 
at the bottom of the Home screen to display a list of all apps on the phone; 
choose the one named Calendar.
The first screen you see is most likely the monthly calendar view, shown 
in Figure 19-1. The calendar looks like a typical monthly calendar, with the 
month and year at the top. Scheduled appointments appear as blue highlights 
on various days.
 
 To view your appointments by week, press the Menu soft button and choose 
Week. Or, you can choose the Day command to see your daily schedule. 
Figure 19-2 shows both Week and Day views in the Calendar.

calendar, the Agenda screen shows only those dates with events and the 
events themselves. It’s sort of a list.

Making a new event
The key to making your calendar work is to add events: appointments, things 
to do, meetings, or full-day events such as birthdays and vacations. To create 
a new event, follow these steps in the Calendar app:
 
1. Select the day for the event.
 
 Use Month or Week view and touch the day of the new event.
 
 To save time, use Day view and touch the hour at which the event starts.
 
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose More and then New Event.
 
  
A screen appears, where you add details about the event.
 
4. Type the event name.
 
 For example, type Picnic or Lunch with Mel or Colonoscopy.
 
5. Touch the Who field to add yourself.
 
 Your account is named Me on the Droid 2.
 
 You can add other people to the event and they’re sent email notifications 
about the event. If you don’t want to bother those folks (or yourself), 
don’t add them (or you) in the Who field.
 
6. Use the buttons by Start to set the starting date and time.
 
7. Use the buttons by End to set the ending date and time.
 
 When an event lasts all day, such as visiting your mother-in-law for an 
hour, simply touch the All Day button to put a check mark there. All-day 
events appear at the top of the day when the Calendar is shown in Week 
view (refer to Figure 19-2).
 
 At this point, you’ve entered the minimum amount of information for 
creating an event. Any details you add are okay but not necessary.
 
8. Touch the Save button.
 
 The Calendar app creates the event.
You can change an event at any time: Simply summon the event as described 
in the preceding section, press the Menu soft button while viewing the event, 
and choose the Edit Event command.
To remove an event, choose an event from the Calendar to view the event 
details. Press the Menu soft button and choose the Delete Event command. 
Touch the OK button to confirm.

 Chapter 19: A Clutch of Apps
 
✓ Adding an event location not only tells you where the event will be 
located but also hooks that information into the Maps app. My advice 
is to type information into an event’s Where field just as though you’re 
typing information to search for a map. When the event is displayed, the 
location is a clickable link (refer to Figure 19-3); touch the location link 
to see where it is on a map.
 
✓ Google Calendar lets you create multiple calendars, which help you cat-
egorize types of events. For example, I have a personal calendar, one for 
my kids’ schedule, one for work, and a travel calendar. Different calen-
dars’ events show up in different colors (refer to Figure 19-2).
 
✓ Use the Repetition button to create repeating events, such as weekly or 
monthly meetings, anniversaries, and birthdays.
 
 
✓ Reminders can be set so that the phone alerts you before an event takes 
place. The alert can show up as a notification icon (shown in the 
margin), or it can be an audio alert or a vibrating alert.
 
✓ To deal with an event notification, pull down the notifications and 
choose the event. You can touch the Dismiss All button to remove event 
alerts.
 
✓ Alert types are set by pressing the Menu soft button in the Calendar app: 
Choose the More command and then Settings. Use the Select Ringtone 
option to choose an audio alert. Use the Vibrate option to control 
whether the phone vibrates to alert you of an impending event.
 
✓ You can also create events by using Google Calendar on the Internet. 
Those events are instantly synced with the calendar on your Droid 2 
phone.
 
✓ I’ve noticed that event times can be affected by your travel. For example, 
I have set my East Coast appointments while on the West Coast, yet 
when I arrived on the East Coast, the Calendar app adjusted the 
appointment times by three hours. I don’t know whether it’s a bug, 
and I don’t know how to fix the problem, given the current edition of the 
software.
Your Phone the Calculator
The Calculator is perhaps the oldest of all traditional cell phone apps. It’s 
probably also the least confusing and frustrating app to use.
Start the Calculator app by choosing its icon from the Applications Tray. The 
Calculator appears, as shown in Figure 19-4.

Figure 19-4: The Calculator.
 
✓ You can swipe the screen (refer to Figure 19-4) to the left to see a panel 
of strange, advanced mathematical operations you’ll probably never use.
 
✓ Use the sliding keyboard’s up- and down-arrow keys to scroll back 
through the previous calculations you’ve made.
 
✓ Long-press the calculator’s text (or results) to cut or copy the results.
 
✓ I use the Calculator most often to determine my tip at a restaurant. It 
takes me almost as long to use the Calculator as it does for smarty-pants 
Barbara to do the 15 percent calculation in her head. That’s when I tip 
18 percent.
No Need to Alarm You
The Droid 2 keeps constant and accurate track of the time, which is displayed 
at the top of the Home screen and also when you first wake up the phone. 
When you’d rather have the phone wake you up, you can take advantage of 
the Alarm & Timer app.
Start the Alarm & Timer app by choosing its icon from the Applications Tray. 
The Alarm Clock is shown in Figure 19-5.
If you see an alarm you want to set, touch the gray square (refer to Figure 19-5) 
to set that alarm. A green check mark in a square indicates that an alarm is set.

✓ To remove an alarm, long-press it from the list and choose the Delete 
Alarm command. Touch the OK button to confirm.
 
✓ The alarm doesn’t work when you turn off the phone. The alarm does, 
however, go off when the phone is sleeping.
 
✓ A notification icon appears when an alarm has gone off but has been 
ignored.
 
✓ So tell me: Do alarms go off or do they go on?
There’s No Tube Like YouTube
YouTube is the Internet phenomenon to prove Andy Warhol right: In the 
future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes. Or, in the case of YouTube, 
they’ll be famous on the Internet for the duration of a 10-minute video. That’s 
because YouTube is the place on the Internet for anyone and everyone to 
share their video creations.
To view the mayhem on YouTube, or to contribute something yourself, 
start the YouTube app. Like all apps on the Droid 2, it can be found on the 
Applications Tray. The main YouTube screen is depicted in Figure 19-6.
To view a video, touch its name or icon in the list.
To search for a video, touch the Search button (refer to Figure 19-6). Type or 
dictate what you want to search for, and then peruse the results.

Movies in the Palm of Your Hand
Wouldn’t it be fun to watch the latest Hollywood hits on your Droid 2? Would 
it be even more fun if the Droid 2 came with an app that did just that? Would 
it be “just the best” if watching those films were free?
Well, two out of three ain’t bad.
The Droid 2 comes with the Blockbuster app, which can be used to rent or 
purchase mainstream movies that you can view right on your phone. The 
key is to have an account at Blockbuster. When you do, you can follow the 
directions on the screen after starting the Blockbuster app and get everything 
signed up and configured. All that’s missing is the popcorn.
Even when you don’t have a Blockbuster account, you can still use the app to 
see which films are available.
The Droid 2 Does Games
For all its seriousness and technology, one of the best uses of a smartphone 
is to play games. I’m not talking about the silly arcade games (though I admit 
that they’re fun). No, I’m talking about some serious portable gaming.
To whet your appetite, the Droid 2 comes with a small taste of what the 
device can do in regard to gaming. It’s the NFS Shift app, which is a car-racing 
game, shown in Figure 19-7.
NFS Shift uses the phone’s accelerometer to steer a high-speed race car 
around various racing tracks from all over the globe. The game also plays 
stereotypical rock music, which either makes the action more exciting or 
merely irritates you.

Figure 19-7: Games on the Droid 2.
If you want to continue playing NFS Shift, you have to buy it. The program 
lets you know how much it costs after you complete your first free race.
Of course, gaming isn’t limited to NFS Shift. Many games — arcade, action, 
and puzzle — can be found in the Android Market. See Chapter 20.

T
hough the Droid 2 comes with a smattering of interesting and diverse 
apps, they are by no means all the apps the phone will ever have. 
That’s because tens of thousands of Android apps are available 
for the Droid 2. You can add them to your phone’s software 
repository at any time, and most of them are free. The 
place you need to visit to find those apps is the Android 
Market.
 
✓ Because the Droid 2 uses the Android operating 
system, it can run nearly all applications 
written for Android.
 
✓ You can be assured that all apps that appear 
in the Android Market on your phone can be 
used with the Droid 2. There’s no way that 
you can download or buy something that’s 
incompatible with your phone.
 
✓ App is short for application. It’s another word for 
software, which is another word for a program that runs 
on a computer or on a mobile device, such as your Droid 2 
phone.

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
Welcome to the Market
Shopping for new software for your Droid 2 can be done anywhere that you 
and your phone just happen to be. You don’t even need to know what kind of 
software you want; like many a mindless ambling shopper, you can browse 
until the touchscreen is smudged and blurry with your fingerprints.
 
✓ You obtain software from the Market by downloading it into your phone. 
That file transfer works best at top speeds; therefore:
 
✓ I highly recommend that you connect to a Wi-Fi network if you plan to 
purchase software at the Android Market. See Chapter 14 for details on 
connecting the Droid 2 to a Wi-Fi network.
Visiting the Market
New apps await delivery into your phone, like animated vegetables shouting, 
“Pick me! Pick me!” To get to them, open the Market icon, which can be found 
on the main Home screen or accessed from the Applications Tray.
After opening the Market app, you see the main screen, similar to the one 
shown in Figure 20-1. You can browse for apps, games, or special apps from 
Verizon by touching the appropriate doodad, as shown in the figure.
Find apps by browsing the lists: Choose Apps (refer to Figure 20-1). Then 
choose a specific category to browse. You can sort apps by their popularity; 
separate categories exist for paid, free, and newer apps.
When you know an app’s name or an app’s category or even what the app 
does, searching for the app works fastest: Touch the Search button at the top 
of the Market screen (refer to Figure 20-1). Type all or part of the app’s name 
or perhaps a description. Touch the keyboard’s Search button to begin your 
search.
To see more information about an app, touch it. Touching the app doesn’t 
buy it, but instead displays a more detailed description, screen shots, and 
comments, plus links to see additional apps or contact the developer.
 
✓ The first time you enter the Android Market, you have to accept the 
terms of service; touch the Accept button.
 
✓ Pay attention to an app’s ratings. Ratings are added by people who use 
the apps, like you and me. Having more stars is better. You can see 
additional information, including individual user reviews, by choosing 
the app.

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
Getting a free app
After you locate an app you want, the next step is to download it. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. If possible, activate the phone’s Wi-Fi connection.
 
 Downloads complete much faster over the Wi-Fi connection than over 
the digital cellular connection. See Chapter 14 for information on 
connecting your Droid 2 phone to a Wi-Fi network.
 
2. Open the Market app.
 
3. Locate the app you want and open its description.
 
 Refer to the preceding section for details. If you’re just starting out, 
consider getting one of the V CAST apps in the Verizon category. (Most 
of them are free.)
 
4. Touch the Install button.
 
 The Install button is found at the bottom of the app’s list o’ details. Free 
apps feature an Install button. Paid apps have a Buy button. (See the 
next section for information on buying an app.)
 
 After touching the Install button, you’re alerted to any services that the 
app uses. The alert isn’t a warning, and it doesn’t mean anything bad. 
It’s just that your phone is telling you which of your phone’s features the 
app uses.
 
5. Touch the OK button to begin the download.
 
 You return to the main Market screen as the app downloads. It 
continues to download while you do other things on your phone.
 
 
 After the download is successful, the phone’s status bar shows a new 
icon, as shown in the margin. That’s the Successful Install notification.
 
6. Pull down the notifications.
 
 See Chapter 3 for details, in case you’ve never pulled down notifications.
 
7. Choose the app from the list of notifications.
 
 The app is listed by its app name, with the text Successfully 
Installed beneath it.
At this point, what happens next depends on the app you’ve downloaded. 
For example, you may have to agree to a license agreement. If so, touch the I 
Agree button. Additional setup may involve signing in to an account or 
creating a profile, for example.

 Chapter 20: Shop at the Android Market
After the initial setup is complete, or if no setup is necessary, you can start 
using the app.
 
✓ Don’t forget to turn off Wi-Fi after downloading your app; Wi-Fi is a drain 
on the phone’s battery.
 
✓ The new app’s icon is placed on the Applications Tray, along with all the 
other apps on the Droid 2.
 
✓ Yes, when you add an app, it shuffles all icons on the Applications 
Tray — no way around that.
 
✓ Peruse the list of services an app uses (in Step 4) to look for anything 
unusual or out of line with the app’s purpose. For example, an alarm 
clock app that uses your contact list and the text messaging service 
would be a red flag, especially if it’s your understanding that the app 
doesn’t need to text message any of your contacts.
 
✓ You can also place a shortcut icon for the app on the Home screen. See 
Chapter 22.
 
✓ The Android market has many wonderful apps you can download. 
Chapter 26 lists some that I recommend, all of which are free.
Buying an app
Some great free apps are available, but many of the apps you dearly want 
probably cost money. It’s not a lot of money, especially compared to the 
price of computer software. In fact, it seems odd to sit and stew over whether 
paying 99 cents for a game is “worth it.”
 
I recommend that you download a free app first, to familiarize yourself with 
the process.
When you’re ready to pay for an app, follow these steps:
 
1. Activate the phone’s Wi-Fi connection.
 
2. Open the Market app.
 
3. Browse or search for the app you want, and choose the app to display 
its description.
 
 Review the app’s price. It’s priced in dollars, euros, pounds, or yen. 
You can buy an app priced in another currency; your credit card or cell 
phone bill is charged the proper amount.
 
4. Touch the Buy button.

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
 
5. Touch OK.
 
 If you don’t have a Google Checkout account, you’re prompted to set 
one up. Follow the directions on the screen.
 
6. Choose the payment method.
 
 You can choose to use an existing credit card, add a new card, or — 
most conveniently — add the purchase to your cellular bill.
 
 If you choose to add a new card, you’re required to fill in all information 
about the card, including the billing address.
 
7. Touch the Buy Now button.
 
 The Buy Now button has the app’s price listed.
 
 After you touch the Buy button, the app is downloaded. You can wait or 
do something else with the phone while the app is downloading.
The app may require additional setup steps, confirmation information, or 
other options.
The app can be accessed from the Applications Tray, just like all other apps 
available on your Droid 2.
Eventually, you receive an email message from Google Checkout, confirming 
your purchase. The message explains how you can get a refund from your 
purchase within 24 hours. The section “Removing installed software,” later in 
this chapter, discusses how to do it.
 
✓ The option to add the purchase to your cell phone bill might not be 
available for all phone plans.
 
✓ Be sure to disable the phone’s Wi-Fi after downloading the app, because 
Wi-Fi is an additional drain on the phone’s battery.
Manage Your Applications
The Market is not only where you buy apps — it’s also the place you return 
to for performing app management. That task includes reviewing apps you’ve 
downloaded, updating apps, and removing apps you no longer want or that 
you severely hate.
Reviewing your downloads
If you’re like me, and if I’m like anyone (and my editor says that I’m not), 
you probably sport a whole host of apps on your Droid 2. It’s kind of fun to 
download new software and give your phone new abilities. To review the 
apps you’ve acquired, follow these steps:
www.it-ebooks.info

 Chapter 20: Shop at the Android Market
 
1. Start the Market app.
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose Downloads.
 
4. Scroll your downloaded apps.
The list of downloaded apps should look similar to the one shown in Figure 20-2.

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
The Downloads list is accurate in that it represents apps you’ve downloaded. 
Some apps in the list, however, might not be installed on your Droid 2: They 
were downloaded, installed, and then removed. To review all apps installed 
on the phone, see the section “Controlling your apps,” later in this chapter.
Updating an app
 
 One nice thing about using the Android Market to get new software is that 
the market also notifies you of new versions of the programs you download. 
Whenever a new version of any app is available, you see the Updates 
Available notification icon, shown in the margin.
Locate apps that need updating by pulling down the phone’s notifications 
and choosing Updates Available. Or, you can visit the Downloads list, as 
described in the preceding section.
To update an app, obey these steps:
 
1. Turn on the phone’s Wi-Fi access, if it’s available.
 
 Updates are downloaded from the Internet, which means the faster your 
phone can connect, the more quickly the updates are made.
 
2. Choose the updated app; touch it to open more details.
 
 For example, touch an app with the Updates Available flag (refer to 
Figure 20-2).
 
3. Touch the Update button.
 
4. Touch the OK button to heed the warning.
 
 The update means that an entirely new version of the app is downloaded 
and installed, which replaces the installed version. That’s okay.
 
5. Optionally, read any services that the app uses on your phone and 
then touch the OK button.
 
 The update is downloaded.
 
 As when you initially install the app, you’re free to do other things with the 
phone while the update is downloading. When downloading is complete, the 
Successful Install notification appears, as shown in the margin. You can then 
start using your updated app or continue applying updates by repeating the 
steps in this section.
After the download is complete, pull down the notifications and select the 
downloaded app from the notifications list. When you first start the updated 
app, you may be asked to agree (again) to the licensing terms; touch the I 
Agree button. After that, you can start using the app.

 Chapter 20: Shop at the Android Market
 
✓ Some apps update themselves automatically. If so, the option to 
automatically update is found in the app itself: Press the Menu soft 
button and choose the Settings command. An automatic update option, 
if available, shows up on the app’s Settings screen.
 
✓ When an app is flagged as a manual update (see Figure 20-2), you must 
select the app from the list and update it by following the directions in 
this section. The app cannot be updated automatically or as part of an 
“Update All” feature.
 
✓ Future releases of the Android operating system may feature an Update 
All button, which updates, all at one time, all apps that have pending 
updates. If so, in Step 3 touch the Update All button to make all your 
apps up-to-date.
 
✓ The Android operating system update might also apply an Update 
Automatically option for your apps. When selected, the apps automatically 
download their updates when available.
Removing installed software
There are a few reasons you’d want to remove installed software. The first, 
most odiously, is that you just don’t like a program or it does something 
so hideously annoying that you find removal of the app to be emotionally 
satisfying. The second is that you have a better program that does the same 
thing. The third reason is to free up a modicum of storage on the phone’s 
internal storage area or MicroSD card.
Whatever your reason, removing an app from your Droid 2 works like this:
 
1. Start the Market app.
 
2. Press the Menu soft button.
 
3. Choose the Downloads heading to summon a list of all software you’ve 
downloaded into your phone.
 
 Refer to Figure 20-2.
 
4. Touch the app that offends you.
 
5. Touch the Uninstall button.
 
6. Touch the OK button to confirm.
 
 The app is removed.
 
7. Fill in the survey to specify why you removed the app.
 
 Be honest, or be as honest as you can given the short list of reasons.
 
8. Touch OK.
 
 The app is gone!

Part IV: More than a Mere Mortal Cell Phone 
The app continues to appear on the Downloads list even after it’s been 
removed. After all, you downloaded it once. That doesn’t mean that the app 
is installed. To review apps installed on the Droid 2, see the next section.
 
✓ In most cases, if you uninstall a paid app before 24 hours has passed, 
your credit card or account is fully refunded.
 
✓ You can always reinstall paid apps that you’ve uninstalled. You aren’t 
charged twice for doing so.
Controlling your apps
 
The Droid 2 has a technical place where you can review and manage all apps 
you’ve installed on your phone. To visit that place, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Menu soft button and choose 
Settings.
 
2. Choose Applications.
 
3. Choose Manage Applications.
 
 A complete list of all applications installed on your phone is displayed. 
Unlike the Downloads list in the Market app, only installed applications 
appear in the list.
 
4. Touch an application name.
 
 Additional details and controls for the application are displayed, similar 
to the ones shown in Figure 20-3.
 
 
5. Touch the Back button when you’re done being baffled by the 
information.
 
 
 You can also just touch the Home soft button to immediately escape to 
the Home screen.
You can use the Application Info screen (refer to Figure 20-3) to uninstall an 
app, similar to the steps described in the preceding section. This technique 
works for some older Android apps that don’t appear on the Downloads list.
Refer to the information in the Storage section to determine how much space 
the app is using on the phone’s internal storage or MicroSD card.
If the app is consuming a huge amount of space compared with other apps 
and you seldom use the app, consider it a candidate for deletion.
The Force Stop button is used to halt a program that runs amok. For example, 
I had to stop an older Android app that continually made noise and offered 
no option to exit. It was a relieving experience. See Chapter 23 for more 
details on shutting down apps run amok.

I
’m not certain about the exact difference 
between a cell phone and a mobile phone. I 
think they’re both the same thing, though the 
term cell phone is more popular these days. I sup-
pose that’s because even an old, landline phone 
could be a “mobile phone” if you threw the thing 
out a window.
The chapters in this part of the book cover an 
assortment of topics here and there — stuff that 
just doesn’t ﬁ t anywhere else. From taking your 
Droid 2 overseas to customizing your phone to 
performing basic maintenance and troubleshoot-
ing, it’s all here. Or there. Then again, that’s why I

B
ack when life was simple, all I had to do was leave the house with my 
wallet. Then I had to carry around some keys: car keys, house keys, 
keys to work. As I grew older, glasses were added to the list of things I had 
to carry with me. Now I have my Droid 2, another must-have acces-
sory that I must tote everywhere I go. I’m just glad that clothes 
come with pockets.
You can not only carry the Droid 2 with you but also 
take it wherever you go — across town, across the 
state, or across the country. You can even take the 
Droid 2 overseas. Talk about exotic: It’s all possible. 
My gentle words of advice in this chapter help 
make your, and your phone’s, travels fruitious and 
fortuitous.
Where the Phone Roams
The word roam takes on an entirely new meaning when 
applied to a cell phone. It means that your phone receives a 
cell signal whenever you’re outside your cell phone carrier’s oper-
ating area. In that case, your phone is roaming.
Roaming sounds handy, but there’s a catch: It almost always involves a sur-
charge for using another cellular service — an unpleasant surcharge.
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
276
Part V: Hither and Thither 
The Droid 2 alerts you whenever you’re roaming. You see a Roaming icon 
appear at the top of the screen, in the status area. The icon tells you that 
you’re outside the regular signal area, possibly using another cellular pro-
vider’s network.
There’s little you can do to avoid incurring roaming surcharges when making 
or receiving phone calls. Well, yes: You can wait until you’re back in an area 
serviced by your primary cellular provider. You can, however, altogether avoid 
using the other network’s data services while roaming. Follow these steps:
 
1. On the Home screen press the Menu soft button and choose Settings.
 
2. Choose Data Manager.
 
3. Choose Data Delivery.
 
 You may see a warning when data roaming is activated on your phone: 
Dismiss the warning or choose the option that disables data roaming. 
Otherwise:
 
4. Ensure that the Data Roaming option isn’t selected.
 
 Remove the green check mark by the Data Roaming option.
The phone can still access the Internet over the Wi-Fi connection when 
you’re roaming. Setting up a Wi-Fi connection doesn’t make you incur extra 
charges, unless you have to pay to get on the wireless network. See Chapter 
14 for more information about Wi-Fi.
Another network service you might want to disable while roaming has to do 
with multimedia text messages, or MMS. To avoid surcharges from another 
cellular network for downloading an MMS message, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Text Messaging app.
 
2. If the screen shows a specific conversation, press the Back soft button

 Chapter 21: On the Road Again
Airplane Mode
As anyone knows who has been flying recently, making a call from your 
cell phone while on an airborne plane is strictly forbidden. That’s because, 
if you did, the navigation system would completely screw up, the plane 
would invert, and everyone onboard would die in a spectacular crash on the 
ground, in a massive fireball suitable for the 5 o’clock “Eyewitness News.” It 
would be breathtaking.
Droid 2 air-travel tips
I don’t consider myself a frequent flyer, but I 
travel several times a year. I do it often enough 
that I wish the airports had separate lines for 
security: one for seasoned travelers, one for 
families, and one, of course, for frickin’ idiots. 
The last category would have to be disguised by 
placing a Bonus Coupons sign or Free Snacks 
banner over the metal detector. That would 
weed ’em out.
Here are some of my cell phone and airline 
travel tips:
 ✓ Charge your phone before you leave home. 
This tip probably goes without saying, but 
you’ll be happier with a full cell phone 
charge to start your journey.
 ✓ Take a cell phone charger with you. Many 
airports feature USB chargers, so you might 
need just a USB-to-micro–USB cable. Still, 
why risk it? Bring the entire charger with 
you.
 ✓ At the security checkpoint, place your 
phone in a bin. Add to the bin all your other 
electronic devices, keys, and brass knuck-
les. I know from experience that keeping 
your cell phone in your pocket most defi-
nitely sets off airport metal detectors.
 ✓ When the flight attendant asks you to turn 
off your cell phone for takeoff and land-
ing, obey the command. That’s turn off, as 
in power off the phone or shut it down. It 
doesn’t mean that you place the phone in 
Airplane mode. Turn it off.
 ✓ Use the phone’s Calendar app to keep track 
of flights. The airline and flight number 
could serve as the event title. For the event 
time, I insert the take-off and landing sched-
ules. For the location, I add the origin and 
destination airport codes. Referencing the 
phone from your airplane seat or in a busy 
terminal is much handier than fussing with 
travel papers. See Chapter 19 for more 
information on the Calendar.
 ✓ Remember that some airlines may even-
tually feature Android apps you can use 
while traveling. Rather than hang on to a 
boarding pass printed by your computer, 
for example, you just present your phone 
to the scanner. (At the time this book was 
published, a few airline-specific apps were 
available for the Droid 2, but none from 
major carriers. I predict that you’ll soon see 
a lot of these apps. Refer to Chapter 20 for 
information on finding apps in the Android 
Market.)
 ✓ Some apps you can use to organize your 
travel details are similar to, but more 
sophisticated than, using the Calendar 
app. Visit the Android Market and search 
for travel or airline to find a host of apps.

Part V: Hither and Thither 
Seriously, you’re not supposed to use a cell phone when flying. Specifically, 
you’re not allowed you make calls in the air. You can, however, use your Droid 2 
to listen to music or play games or do anything else that doesn’t require a cel-
lular connection. The secret is to place the phone in Airplane mode.
The most convenient way to put the Droid 2 in Airplane mode is to press and 
hold the Power button. From the menu, choose Airplane Mode. You don’t 
even need to unlock the phone to perform this operation.
The most inconvenient way to put the Droid 2 into Airplane mode is to follow 
these steps:
 
1. From the Applications Tray, choose the Settings icon.
 
2. Choose Wireless & Networking.
 
3. Touch the square by Airplane Mode to set the green check mark.
 
 When the green check mark is visible, Airplane mode is active.
 
 When the phone is in Airplane mode, a special icon appears in the status 
area, as shown in the margin. You might also see the text No Service appear 
on the phone’s locked screen.
To exit Airplane mode, repeat the steps in this section but remove the green 
check mark by touching the square next to Airplane Mode.
 
✓ Officially, the Droid 2 should be powered off when the plane is taking off 
or landing. See Chapter 2 for information on turning off the phone.
 
✓ You can compose email while the phone is in Airplane mode. The mes-
sages aren’t sent until you disable Airplane mode and connect again 
with a data network.
 
✓ Another quick way to activate or disable Airplane mode is to use the 
Power Control widget, which appears on the second Home screen to the 
left of the main Home screen.
 
✓ Bluetooth networking is disabled when you activate the Droid 2 Airplane 
mode, but it can be reenabled after Airplane mode is active. Even so, 
using Bluetooth during a flight isn’t recommended on many airlines. See 
Chapter 14 for more information on Bluetooth.
 
✓ Many airlines now feature wireless networking onboard. You can turn 
on wireless networking for the Droid 2 and use a wireless network in 
the air. Simply activate the Droid 2 Wi-Fi feature, per the directions in 
Chapter 14, after placing the phone in Airplane mode — well, after the 
flight attendant tells you that it’s okay to do so.

 Chapter 21: On the Road Again
International Calling
You can use your cell phone to dial up folks who live in other countries. You 
can also take your cell phone overseas and use it in another country. Doing 
either task isn’t as difficult as properly posing for a passport photo, but it can 
become frustrating and expensive when you don’t know your way around.
Dialing an international number
A phone is a bell that anyone in the world can ring. To prove it, all you need 
is the phone number of anyone in the world. Dial that number using your 
Droid 2 and, as long as you both speak the same language, you’re talking!
To make an international call with the Droid 2, you merely need to know the 
foreign phone number. That number includes the international country-code 
prefix, followed by the number.
Before dialing the international country-code prefix, you must dial a plus 
sign (+) on the Droid 2. The + symbol is the country exit code, which must be 
dialed in order to flee the national phone system and access the international 
phone system. For example, to dial Finland on your Droid 2, you dial +358 
and then the number in Finland. The +358 is the exit code (+) plus the inter-
national code for Finland (358).
To produce the + code in an international phone number, press and hold the 
0 key on the Droid 2 dialpad. Then input the country prefix and the phone 
number. Touch the Dial button (the green Phone icon) to complete the call.
 
✓ In most cases, dialing an international number involves a time zone dif-
ference. Before you dial, be aware of what time it is in the country or 
location you’re calling.
 
✓ Dialing internationally also involves surcharges, unless your cell phone 
plan already provides for international dialing.
 
✓ The + character is used on the Droid 2 to represent the country exit 
code, which must be dialed before you can access an international 
number. In the United States, the exit code is 011. (In the United 
Kingdom, it’s 00.) So, if you’re using a landline to dial Russia from the 
United States, you dial 011 to escape from the United States and then 7, 
the country code for Russia. Then dial the rest of the number. You don’t 
have to do that on the Droid 2, because + is always the country exit code 
and replaces the 011 for U.S. users.

280
Part V: Hither and Thither 
 
✓ The + character isn’t a number separator. When you see an international 
number listed as 011+20+xxxxxxx, do not insert the + character in the 
number. Instead, dial +20 and then the rest of the number.
 
✓ International calls fail for a number of reasons. One of the most common 
is that the recipient’s phone company or service blocks incoming inter-
national calls.
 
✓ Another reason that international calls fail is the zero reason: Often 
times, you must leave out any zero in the phone number that follows the 
country code. So, if the country code is 254 for Kenya and the phone 
number starts with 012, you dial +254 for Kenya and then 12 and the 
rest of the number. Omit the leading zero.
 
✓ You can also send text messages to international cell phones. It works 
the same way as making a traditional phone call: Input the international 
number into the Messaging app. See Chapter 9 for more information on 
text messaging.
 
✓ Know which type of phone you’re calling internationally — cell phone or 
landline. The reason is that an international call to a cell phone often 
involves a surcharge that doesn’t apply to a landline.
Making international calls with Skype mobile
Your Droid 2 comes with the Skype mobile app, which can be used to make 
inexpensive international calls. It’s an excellent option, especially when your 
cellular contract doesn’t provide for international calling.
If you don’t yet have a Skype account, use your computer to create one. You 
need that account to use Skype mobile. Set up the account by first obtaining 
the Skype program for your computer: Visit www.skype.com to get started. 
Further, you must have Skype Credit to make the international call. That 
credit can be purchased from within the Skype program on your computer.
The Skype mobile app is found in the Applications Tray. After starting the 
app, log in with your Skype ID and password.
You can’t make an international call unless you’ve created a contact with an 
international number. The contact must be a Skype mobile contact, shown on 
the Contacts tab on the Skype mobile screen, illustrated in Figure 21-1.
To make an international call, touch the Call Phones tab at the top of the 
screen. Punch in the number, including the + symbol for international access, 
as described in this chapter and shown in Figure 21-1. Touch the Call button 
to make the call.

When you’re finished with the call, touch the End button.
 
✓ You’re always signed into Skype mobile unless you sign out. Pressing the 
Home button to switch away from the app doesn’t log you out of Skype.
 
✓ To log out of Skype mobile, press the Menu soft button, choose More, 
and then choose Sign Out.
 
✓ The first time you use the Skype mobile app, you’re required to read 
various information and agree to the licensing terms. La-di-da.
 
✓ At the time this book went to press, Skype mobile required a digital cel-
lular signal; it doesn’t work over a Wi-Fi connection.
 
✓ Check with your cellular provider to see whether you’re charged con-
nection minutes for using Skype mobile. Even though the international 
call is free, you might still be dinged for the minutes you use on Skype to 
make the call.
Taking your Droid 2 abroad
The easiest way to use a cell phone abroad is to rent or buy one in the coun-
try where you plan to stay. I’m serious: Often, international roaming charges 
are so high that it’s just cheaper to buy a throwaway cell phone wherever 
you go, especially if you plan to stay there for a while.
When you opt to use your Droid 2 rather than buy a local phone, phone calls 
and Internet access should run smoothly — if a compatible cellular service is 
in your location. (The Droid 2 uses the CDMA cellular network.) The foreign 
carrier accepts incoming and outgoing calls from your phone and cheerfully 
charges you the international roaming rate.
The key to determining whether your Droid 2 is usable in a foreign country is to 
turn it on. The name of that country’s compatible cellular service should show 
up at the top of the phone, where Verizon Wireless (or whatever your carrier 
is) appears on the Droid 2 main screen. (Refer to Figure 2-1, in Chapter 2.)
 
✓ You receive calls on your cell phone internationally as long as the Droid 2 
can access the network. Your friends need only dial your cell phone 
number as they normally do; the phone system automatically forwards 
your calls to wherever you are in the world.
 
✓ The person calling you doesn’t pay extra when you’re off romping the 
globe with your Droid 2. Nope — you pay extra for the call.
 
✓ You can also determine whether your Droid 2 can be used in a foreign 
country, by visiting this Web page:

C
ustomization is one of those tasks that few people seem to try. 
Perhaps they don’t know that just about everything about 
their Droid 2 can be changed, perfected to look or behave 
the way they want. Maybe those people are afraid that 
something will break. Maybe they don’t realize how 
much better the phone can work by customizing it 
to the way they use it and setting the options they 
prefer. But that’s them. For you, I present this chap-
ter, which tells you how to customize the Droid 2 to 
make it your own.
It’s Your Home Screen
The Droid 2 sports a roomy Home screen. It’s really 
seven Home screens. Of course, the phone comes precon-
figured with lots of icons and widgets festooning all seven of 
the Home screens. You can customize them by removing widgets 
and icons, especially those you seldom use, and replacing them with icons 
and widgets you do use. You can also add folders to organize things, and you 
can even put a new wallpaper on the Home screen. Truly, you can make the 
Home screen look just the way you want.

Part V: Hither and Thither 
For the most part, the key to changing the Home screen is the long-press: 
Press and hold your finger on a blank part of the Home screen (not on an 
icon). You see a pop-up menu appear, as shown in Figure 22-1. From that 
menu, you can begin your Home screen customization adventure, as dis-
cussed in this section.
Figure 22-1: The Add to Home Screen menu.
Changing wallpaper
The Home screen has two types of backgrounds, or wallpapers: traditional 
and live. Live wallpapers are animated. A not-so-live wallpaper can be any 
image, such as a picture from the Gallery.
To set a new wallpaper for the Home screen, obey these steps:
 
1. Long-press the Home screen.
 
 The Add to Home Screen menu appears, as shown in Figure 22-1.
 
2. Choose Wallpapers.
 
 Another menu appears, with three options (refer to Figure 22-2).
 
3. Select an option based on the type of wallpaper.

Figure 22-2: Selecting wallpaper.
 
✓ Live Wallpapers: Choose an animated or interactive wallpaper from 
a list.
 
✓ Media Gallery: Choose a still image from those you’ve taken, stored 
in the Gallery app.
 
✓ Wallpapers: Choose a wallpaper from a range of stunning images 
(no nudity).
 
4. Choose the wallpaper you want from the list.
 
 For the Media Gallery option, you see a preview of the wallpaper where 
you can select and crop part of the image.
 
 For certain live wallpapers, a Settings button may appear. The settings 
let you customize certain aspects of the interactive wallpaper.
 
5. Touch the Save or Set Wallpaper button to confirm your selection.
 
 The new wallpaper takes over the Home screen.
Live wallpaper is interactive, usually featuring some form of animation. 
Otherwise, the wallpaper image scrolls slightly as you swipe from one Home 
screen to another.
 
 
✓ The Zedge app has some interesting wallpaper features. Check it out at 
the Android Market; see Chapter 20.
 
✓ You can also download wallpapers from the Android Market. Again, see 
Chapter 20.
 
✓ Be careful when using live wallpapers. The animation consumes proces-
sor power on the Droid 2, which sometimes affects the performance of 
other apps as well as your phone’s battery life.
 
✓ See Chapter 17 for more information about the Gallery, including infor-
mation on how cropping an image works.

Adding apps to the Home screen
You need not live with the unbearable proposition that you’re stuck with 
only the apps supplied on the Home screen. Nope — you’re free to add your 
own apps. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Touch the Launcher button to hunt down the app you want to add to 
the Home screen.
 
2. Press — and keep pressing — an app’s icon.
 
 After a moment, you return to the Home screen with the app’s icon still 
stuck under your finger.
 
3. Slide your finger — still pressed down — left or right to go to a left or 
right part of the Home screen.
 
 Seven Home screens are on the Droid 2.
 
4. Position your finger — still pressed down — on the spot where you 
want the app’s icon to be placed.
 
5. Release your finger.
 
 A copy of the app’s icon is placed on the Home screen. There’s no need 
to clean your fingertip after completing these steps.
The app hasn’t moved: What you see is a copy. You can still find the app on 
the Applications Tray, but now the app is — more conveniently — available 
on the Home screen.
 
✓ Keep your favorite apps, those you use most often, on the Home screen.
 
✓ You cannot drop an app in a spot where the Home screen is already full 
of apps or widgets. Try using a blank Home screen.
 
✓ When the Home screen gets too full, you can organize your apps into 
folders. See the later section “Organizing apps into folders.”
Slapping down widgets
Just as you can add apps to the Home screen, you can add widgets. A widget 
works like a tiny, interactive or informative window, often providing a gate-
way into another app on the Droid 2.
The Droid 2 comes with a bazillion widgets, stuck to the Home screen like 
bugs on a windshield after a long car trip. You can place even more widgets 
on the Home screen by following these steps:
 
1. Long-press the Home screen.
 
2. Choose Motorola Widgets or Android Widgets from the Add to Home 
Screen menu.
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

287
 Chapter 22: Customize Your Droid 2
 
3. From the list, choose the widget you want to add.
 
 The widget is plopped on the Home screen.
The variety of available widgets depends on the applications you have 
installed. Some applications come with widgets, some don’t.
 
✓ More widgets are available at the Android Market. See Chapter 20.
 
✓ The Motorola Widget category contains widgets customized for your 
Verizon Droid 2 phone. The Android Widget category contains widgets 
available to users of any Android phone. If you can’t find the widget you 
want in one category, repeat Steps 1 and 2 to look in the other.
 
✓ You cannot install a widget when the Home screen has no room for it. 
Choose another Home screen, or remove icons or widgets from the cur-
rent Home screen.
 
✓ To remove a widget, see the later section “Rearranging and removing 
icons and widgets.”
Creating shortcuts
A shortcut is a doodad you can place on the Home screen that’s neither an 
app nor a widget. Instead, a shortcut is a handy way to get at a feature or an 
informational tidbit stored in the phone without having to endure complex 
gyrations.
For example, I have a shortcut on my Home screen that uses the Maps app 
Navigation feature to help me return to my house. I don’t use the app when 
I’m running from an irate mob, either.
To add a shortcut, long-press the Home screen and choose the Shortcuts 
command from the Add to Home Screen menu (refer to Figure 22-1). What 
happens next depends on which shortcut you choose.
For example, when you choose a bookmark, you add a Web page bookmark 
to the Home screen. Touch that shortcut to open the Browser app and visit 
that Web page.
Choose a Contact shortcut to display contact information for a specific 
person, The Droid 2 has shortcuts for Music and the Maps app (Direction & 
Navigation); plus, shortcuts for various apps are installed on your phone.
A nerdy shortcut to add is the Settings shortcut. After choosing this item, 
you can select from a number of on-off options that can appear on the Home 
screen as widgets.

288
Part V: Hither and Thither 
 
 The AnyCut app is useful for creating certain shortcuts that the Droid 2 
cannot create by itself, such as a shortcut to direct-dial a contact. Check out 
AnyCut at the Android Market; see Chapter 20.
Rearranging and removing icons and widgets
Icons and widgets aren’t fastened to the Home screen. If they are, it’s day-old 
chewing gum that binds them, considering how easily you can rearrange and 
remove unwanted items from the Home screen.
Press and hold an icon on the Home screen to move it. Eventually, the icon 
seems to lift and break free, as shown in Figure 22-3.
You can drag a free icon to another position on the Home screen or to another 
Home screen, or you can drag it to the Trash icon that appears at the bottom 
of the Home screen, replacing the Launcher button (refer to Figure 22-3).
Widgets can also be moved around or removed in the same manner as icons.
 
✓ Dragging a Home screen icon or widget to the Trash removes the icon or 
widget from the Home screen. It doesn’t remove the application, which 
is still found on the Applications Tray, or the widget, which you can add 
to the Home screen again, as described earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ When an icon hovers over the Trash, ready to be deleted, its color 
changes to red.
 
✓ See Chapter 20 for information on uninstalling applications.
 
✓ Your clue that an icon or widget is free and clear to navigate is that the 
Launcher button changes to the Trash icon (refer to Figure 22-3).
Organizing apps into folders
When you run out of room on the Home screen, or you feel like adding an 
extra level of Home screen organization, you can create a folder. The folder is 
used to store icons, similar to the way folders on your computer store files. 
The result is the same for both: organization.
Create a folder by following these steps:
 
1. Long-press the Home screen.
 
2. Choose the Folders command.
 
 A list appears, showing many different types of folders you can create 
on the Home screen. The number of items in the list depends on the var-
ious apps you have installed and whether the app allows you to create 
handy Home screen folders.

then you can drag the icon to a new position on the Home screen or drag it to

Delete folders by dragging them to the Trash.
Droid 2 Security
The Droid 2 comes with a lock, a simple touchscreen gizmo you slide to the 
right to unlock the phone and gain access to its information and features. 
It’s the keyguard. For most folks, the keyguard is secure enough. For many 
others, the keyguard is about as effective as using wet tissue paper for armor.
You can add three additional types of security locks to your phone: a pattern 
lock, a PIN lock, or a password lock. The details are provided in this section.

 Chapter 22: Customize Your Droid 2
Applying, or removing, a lock starts with these basic steps:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu soft button.
 
2. Choose Settings.
 
3. Choose Location & Security.
 
4. Choose Set Up Screen Lock.
 
 The four types of screen lock are displayed:
 
• None: No additional security lock is applied, or an existing security 
lock is removed.
 
• Pattern: You must trace a pattern to unlock the phone.
 
• PIN: You must input a personal identification number (PIN) to 
unlock the phone.
 
• Password: You must type a password to unlock the phone.
 
5. To set a lock, refer to the following sections; or, to remove an existing 
lock, choose None.
 
 When you choose None, you’re asked to unlock the phone one more 
time, tracing the pattern or typing the PIN or password to remove the 
existing lock.
When the Screen Lock item is deselected (you’ve chosen None for the 
phone’s security level), the Droid 2 returns to its normal mode of operation: 
Pressing the Power button summons the keyguard screen.
Further, if the screen lock isn’t in place, you cannot add the extra levels of 
security covered in the next two sections.
 
✓ The security you add affects the way you turn on and wake up your 
phone. See Chapter 2 for details.
 
✓ The security lock can be overridden when USB debugging is enabled. 
Unless you’re writing software for the Droid 2, however, odds are good 
that you’ll never have USB debugging turned on.
Creating an unlock pattern
One of the best ways to secure your phone and its information is to create 
an unlock pattern, a pattern that must be duplicated (or followed) to unlock 
the phone and make calls, though unlocking isn’t required for answering the 
phone.

fingers are. Use Figure 22-5 as your guide no matter what type of fingers 
you have.
 
 You can hit each dot only once in the pattern. The pattern must have a 
minimum of four dots.

9. Draw the pattern again to confirm that you have more than a goldfish 
memory and can repeat yourself.
 
 According to research paid for with your tax dollars, goldfish have a 
two-second memory. If you’re a goldfish and can’t remember your pat-
tern, touch the Cancel button and start over again in Step 4.
 
10. Touch the Confirm button.
 
 You return to the main Location & Security Settings window.
 
11. Ensure that a check mark appears by Use Visible Patten.
 
 The check mark ensures that the pattern shows up. For even more secu-
rity, you can disable this option, but you really have to remember how 
the pattern goes.
The pattern lock is required whenever you turn on the phone or awaken it 
from Snooze mode. Chapter 2 describes how to use the unlock pattern.
To remove the pattern, follow Steps 1 through 5 in the preceding section. 
Confirm the unlock pattern and it’s disabled.
 
✓ The unlock pattern can be as simple or complex as you like. I’m a big fan 
of simple.
 
✓ Wash your hands! Smudge marks on the display can betray your pattern.
Setting a PIN
I suppose that using a PIN, or personal identification number, is more left-
brained than using a pattern lock. So, if you have no trouble remembering 
numbers or you do have trouble remembering patterns, and you want more 
security on your Droid 2, consider adding a passcode.
To add a passcode, follow Steps 1 through 5 in the earlier section “Droid 2 
Security” and choose a PIN. You see an input screen, similar to Figure 22-6.
Punch in at least four numbers for the PIN. Touch the Continue button to 
confirm the PIN or the Cancel button to bail out (refer to Figure 22-6).
Do it again: After typing the PIN the first time, you’re asked to repeat yourself. 
You need to assure the Droid 2 that you haven’t just forgotten the number 
you chose. Touch the OK button to set the PIN lock.
The PIN is required when you turn on or wake up the Droid 2.

Assigning your Droid 2 a password
The password lock works similarly to the PIN lock for your Droid 2. The main 
difference is that you can choose letters and symbols in addition to numbers 
for your secret code.
To slap down a password on your phone, follow the steps outlined in the 
earlier section “Droid 2 Security” and choose Password as your type of 
screen lock.
Type a password of at least four letters, numbers, or symbols. Basically, you 
can type any character that appears on the onscreen keyboard, though you 
can use either the onscreen or sliding keyboard to type the password.

Touch the Continue button to proceed, and then type your password a 
second time to confirm. Touch the OK button to lock the password in place.
As with other forms of Droid 2 security (pattern lock and PIN), you’re 
prompted for your password every time you turn on or wake up the phone.
To remove the password lock, choose None after following the steps in the 
section “Droid 2 Security,” earlier in this chapter.
Various Phone Adjustments
The Droid 2 has many options and settings for you to adjust. You can fix 
things that annoy you or make things better to please your tastes. The whole 
idea is to make the phone more usable for you.
Stopping the noise!
The Droid 2 features a bag of tricks designed to silence the phone. These 
techniques can come in quite handy, especially when a cell phone’s digital 
noise can be outright annoying.
Vibration mode: You can make the phone vibrate for all incoming calls, 
which works in addition to any ringtone you’ve set (and still works when 
you’ve silenced the phone). To activate Vibration all-the-time mode, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Press the Launcher button on the Home screen to display the 
Applications Tray.
 
2. Choose the Settings app.
 
3. Choose Sound.
 
4. Choose Vibrate.
 
5. Choose Always.
Silent mode: Silent mode disables all sounds from the phone, except for 
music and YouTube and other types of media, as well as alarms that have 
been set by the Alarm & Timer and Calendar apps.
To enter Silent mode, follow Steps 1 through 4 in the previous set of steps, 
and for Step 5 place a check mark by the item Silent Mode.

Performing automatic phone tricks
Two phone settings on the Droid 2 might come in handy: Auto Answer and 
Auto Retry. Both options are found on the Call Settings screen: Start the 
Settings icon from the Applications tray and choose the Call Settings item.
By placing a check mark by Auto Answer, you direct the Droid 2 to automati-
cally answer the phone whenever the headset is attached. The assumption 
is that you are using the phone — listening to music, for example — when a 
call comes in. When the Auto Answer item is on, the phone call is answered 
automatically.
By placing a check mark by Auto Retry, you direct the phone to automatically 
redial a number when the call doesn’t go through. Obviously, this feature is 
ideal for radio show call-in contests.
Changing various settings
Here are a smattering of settings you can adjust on the phone — all made 
from, logically, the Settings screen. To get there from the Home screen, press 
the Menu soft button and choose the Settings command.
You can also view the Settings screen by choosing the Settings app on the 
Applications Tray.
Screen brightness: Choose Display and then choose Brightness. Move the 
slider on the screen to specify how bright the display appears.
 
Place a check mark by Automatic Brightness to have the Droid 2’s internal 
eyeball examine the lighting situation and set the brightness accordingly.
Screen timeout: Choose Display and then choose Screen Timeout. Select a 
timeout value from the list. This duration specifies when the phone goes into 
Snooze mode.
Ringer volume: Choose Sound and then choose Volume. Use the sliders to 
set the volume for the various types of noises the Droid 2 makes. Touch OK 
when you’re done.
Call Connect: Choose Sound and place a check mark by the option Call 
Connect. Whenever a new call comes in, you hear a sound, alerting you to the 
new call. This option is especially helpful when you use the Droid 2 to listen 
to music.

 Chapter 22: Customize Your Droid 2
Network Lost Tone: Choose Sound and then place a check mark by the 
option Network Lost Tone. The Droid 2 plays a tone whenever a phone call is 
dropped because of a poor network connection.
Keep the phone awake when plugged in: Choose Applications and then 
choose Development. Place a check mark by the option Stay Awake.
Adjust the keyboards: Choose Language & Keyboard and then choose Multi-
Touch Keyboard. A smattering of interesting options appears — options you 
can set when they please you or deactivate when they annoy you.
Settings for the sliding keyboard can be found on the Language & Keyboard 
screen: Choose the Device Keyboard menu item.
Disable automatic word correction and suggestions: To halt the keyboard’s 
(often wrong) spell checking and suggestions, choose Language & Keyboard 
and then Multi-Touch Keyboard. There you find options for both the 
onscreen and sliding keyboards with regard to automatic word correction 
and suggestions:
Remove the check marks by Show Suggestions in both the On-Screen 
Keyboard and Device Keyboard areas. Also remove the check mark by the 
item Auto-Correct Errors in both areas, if that feature is vexing you.
Setting the double-tap Home soft button function
When you press the Home soft button twice, the Droid 2 opens the Voice 
Commands app. It doesn’t have to. You can set which app or phone function 
launches when you press the Home soft button twice. Follow these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, press the Menu soft button.
 
2. Choose Settings.
 
3. Choose Applications.
 
4. Choose Double Tap Home Launch.
 
5. Choose a new function or app from the menu.
Choose something you do often, such as the Dialer app to dial the phone, the 
Browser to cruise the Web, or the Camera to take a picture or video.
The options available are limited to only those items that show up on the 
menu (refer to Step 5). Perhaps a future release of the Android operating 
system will allow for more choices to be specified for the double-tap Home 
soft button feature.

Using accessibility settings
If you find the Droid 2 not meeting your needs or you notice that some 
features don’t work well for you, consider taking advantage of some of the 
phone’s accessibility features. Follow these steps:
 
 
1. While at the Home screen, press the Menu soft button.
 
2. Choose Settings.
 
3. Choose Accessibility.
 
4. Place a check mark by the Accessibility option.
 
 Two options become available when Accessibility is on:
 
• Voice Readouts: Touching items on the screen directs the phone to 
read that text.
 
• Zoom Mode: A magnification window appears on the touchscreen, 
allowing you to better see teensy information.
 
5. Touch the OK button after reading the scary warning.
 
 The accessibility feature is active.
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to activate other features.
To disable any accessibility settings, repeat these steps and remove check 
marks in Step 4. Or, just uncheck the Accessibility setting to disable them all. 
Touch OK to confirm.
 
When you’re using the Voice Readout option, use the sliding keyboard to 
choose menu items: Use the arrow keys to move through menu items. Press 
the OK key to choose an item.

Maintenance and Troubleshooting
In This Chapter
▶ Checking the phone’s battery usage
▶ Making the battery last
▶ Cleaning the phone
▶ Keeping the system up-to-date
▶ Dealing with problems
▶ Finding support
▶ Getting answers to common questions
P
ray tell, what kind of maintenance can a cell phone need? It isn’t like 
you need to winterize your Droid 2. It has no regular tune-up sched-
ule. And, thank goodness you never need to change its oil. For 
you, phone maintenance duties are rather light, and with 
the pleasant side effect of them being relatively painless. 
Because of that, I’ve had to toss in the topic of trouble-
shooting, just to make a full-length chapter.
Battery Care and Feeding
Perhaps the most important item you can monitor 
and maintain on your cell phone is its battery. The 
battery supplies the necessary electrical juice by 
which the phone operates. Without battery power, 
your Droid 2 is about as useful as a tin can and string 
for communications. Keep an eye on the battery.
Monitoring the battery
The Droid 2 displays the current battery status at the top of the screen, in 
the status area, next to the time. The icons used to display battery status are 
shown in Figure 23-1.

Battery is being charged.
Figure 23-1: Battery status icons.
You might also see an icon for a dead or missing battery, but for some reason 
I can’t get my phone to turn on and display that icon.
You can check the specific battery level by following these steps:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Menu button.
 
2. Choose Settings.
 
3. Choose About Phone.
 
4. Choose Status.
The top two items on the Status screen offer information about the battery:
Battery Status: This setting explains what’s going on with the battery. It 
might say Full when the battery is full or Charging when the battery is being 
charged, or you might see other text, depending on how desperate the phone 
is for power.
Battery Level: This setting reveals a percentage value describing how much 
of the battery is charged. A value of 100 percent indicates a fully charged bat-
tery. A value of 110 percent means that someone can’t do math.

301
 Chapter 23: Maintenance and Troubleshooting
Later sections in this chapter describe activities that consume battery power 
and how to deal with battery issues.
 
✓ Heed those low-battery warnings! The phone sounds a notification when-
ever the battery gets low. (See the orange battery icon shown earlier, in 
Figure 23-1). The phone sounds another notification when the battery 
gets very low. (See the red battery icon in Figure 23-1).
 
✓ When the battery is too low, the phone shuts itself off.
 
✓ In addition to the status icons, the Droid 2 notification light turns a scary 
shade of red when battery juice is dreadfully low.
 
✓ The best way to deal with a low battery is to connect the phone to a 
power source: Either plug the phone into a wall socket or connect the 
phone to a computer by using a USB cable. The phone charges itself 
immediately; plus, you can use the phone while it’s charging.
 
✓ You don’t have to fully charge the phone to use it. If you have only 20 
minutes to charge and the phone goes back up to only a 70 percent bat-
tery level, that’s great. Well, it’s not great, but it’s far better than a 20 
percent battery level.
 
✓ When the battery gets very low, you see a pop-up message on the 
screen, urging you to plug it in at once!
 
✓ Battery percentage values are best-guess estimates. Just because you 
talked for two hours and the battery shows 50 percent doesn’t mean 
that you’re guaranteed two more hours of talking. Odds are good that 
you have much less than two hours. In fact, as the percentage value gets 
low, the battery appears to drain faster.
Determining what is sucking up power
A nifty screen on the Droid 2 reviews which activities have been consuming 
power when the phone is operating from its battery. The informative screen 
is shown in Figure 23-2.
To get to this screen, follow these steps:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Menu button.
 
2. Choose Settings.
 
3. Choose Battery Manager.
 
 You see a wonderfully big, graphic battery meter. It’s pretty, but it’s not 
your final destination.
 
4. Touch the big battery icon.
 
 You see a screen similar to the one shown in Figure 23-2.

Part V: Hither and Thither 
Figure 23-2: Things that drain 
the battery.
The number and variety of items listed on the Battery Use screen depend on 
what you’ve been doing with your phone between charges and how many dif-
ferent programs you’re using.
Carefully note which applications consume the most battery power. If pos-
sible, curb your use of those programs to conserve the juice. For example, 
I could have saved 11 percent by not playing that dratted, addicting Jewels 
game. Refer to Figure 23-2.
Managing battery performance
The Droid 2 features Battery Mode settings to help you manage the phone’s 
power consumption. Similar to managing power on a computer, you can con-
figure your phone to use one of four power modes:
Maximum Battery Saver: In this most restrictive mode, the phone may even 
turn off its digital cellular connection to save power. Just about anything that 
can be held back or have a timeout applied is restricted in Maximum Battery 
Saver mode.
Nighttime Saver: In this mode, the phone uses Performance mode (no bat-
tery savings) during daytime hours but switches to Maximum Battery Saver 
mode during the nighttime hours.

 Chapter 23: Maintenance and Troubleshooting
Performance: In this mode, nothing is held back, no timeouts are set, and the 
phone operates using all its capabilities. Performance mode has no power 
restrictions. It is, essentially, no power management.
Custom Battery Saver: In this mode, you get to customize your phone’s 
battery-saving options. You can set timeout values and make other changes 
to customize the way the Droid 2 conserves power.
To set a battery profile on your Droid 2, follow these steps:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Menu button.
 
2. Choose Settings.
 
3. Choose Battery Manager.
 
4. Choose Battery Mode.
 
5. Choose a battery profile from the list.
 
6. Optionally, read the warning message and touch the OK button.
When you select Custom Battery Saver mode, you can touch the gear icon to 
the right of the Custom Battery Saver item to see another screen full of vari-
ous battery options, timeouts, and additional settings that can be custom-
ized. Figure 23-3 describes what’s up.
The Droid 2 ships with Nighttime Saver mode enabled.
Saving battery life
Here’s a smattering of things you can do to help prolong battery life in your 
Droid 2:
Turn off vibration options: The phone’s vibration is caused by a teensy 
motor. Though you don’t see much battery savings by disabling the vibration 
options, it’s better than no savings. To turn off vibration, follow these steps:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Menu button.
 
2. Choose Settings.
 
3. Choose Sound.
 
4. Choose Vibrate.
 
5. Choose Never.
 
6. Also on the Sound Settings screen: Remove the check mark by Haptic 
Feedback.
 
 The Haptic Feedback option is what causes the phone to vibrate when 
you touch the soft buttons.

Additionally, consider lowering the volume of notifications by choosing the 
Volume option. This option also saves a modicum of battery life, though in 
my travels I’ve missed important notifications by setting the volume too low.
Dim the screen: If you look at Figure 23-2 (earlier in this chapter), you see 
that the display sucks down quite a lot of battery power. Though a dim 
screen can be more difficult to see, especially outdoors, it definitely saves on 
battery life.
You set the screen brightness from the Settings app: Choose Display and 
then choose Brightness.

 Chapter 23: Maintenance and Troubleshooting
Turn off Bluetooth: When you’re not using Bluetooth, turn it off. Or, when 
you really need that cyborg Bluetooth ear thing, try to keep your phone 
plugged in. See Chapter 14 for information on turning off Bluetooth, though 
you can do it quickly from the Power Control widget.
Turn off Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi networking on the Droid 2 keeps you on the Internet at 
top speeds but drains the battery. Because I tend to use Wi-Fi when I’m in 
one place, I keep my phone plugged in. Otherwise, the battery drains like my 
bank account at Christmas. Refer to Chapter 14 for information on turning off 
the phone’s Wi-Fi.
Disable automatic syncing: The Droid 2 syncs quite often. In fact, it surprises 
me when I update something on the Internet and find the phone updated 
almost instantly. When you need to save battery power and frequent updates 
aren’t urgent (such as when you’re spending a day traveling), disable auto-
matic syncing by following these steps:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Menu button.
 
2. Choose Settings.
 
3. Choose Accounts.
 
4. Choose your Google account.
 
5. Remove the green check mark by each item.
 
When saving battery juice isn’t important, remember to repeat these steps to 
reenable background and automatic synchronization.
Battery replacement
Unlike on some cell phones, you can easily 
replace the battery in the Droid 2. Chapter 1 dis-
cusses how to install and remove the battery. 
It’s cinchy! But the real questions come when 
you need to replace the battery and have to 
decide what to replace it with.
Under normal usage, the battery in the Droid 2 
should last at least as long as the typical two-
year cellular contract. The battery is probably 
good for about four years if you treat it prop-
erly. Even so, at some point the battery will fail: 
The battery charge decreases and, eventually, 
the battery doesn’t even hold a charge.
Ensure that any replacement battery you buy 
is compatible with the Droid 2. A BP6X bat-
tery from Motorola (the phone’s manufacturer) 
works best. Otherwise, ensure that the battery 
is a 3.7V battery designed for the Droid 2. Avoid 
buying batteries for your electronics at swap 
meets or from the back of trucks in grocery 
store parking lots.

Regular Phone Maintenance
The Droid 2 gives you only two tasks that you can do for regular mainte-
nance on the phone: Keep it clean, which is probably something you’re doing 
already, and keep important information backed up.
Keeping it clean
You probably already keep your phone clean. I must use my sleeve to wipe 
the touch screen at least a dozen times a day. Of course, better than your 
sleeve is something called a microfiber cloth. This item can be found at any 
computer- or office-supply store.
 
✓ Never use any liquid to clean the touch screen — especially ammonia or 
alcohol. Those substances damage the touch screen.
 
✓ If the screen keeps getting dirty, consider adding a screen protector. This 
specially designed cover prevents the screen from getting scratched or 
dirty but also lets you use your finger on the touchscreen. Be sure that 
the screen protector is designed for use with the Droid 2.
 
✓ You can also find customized Droid 2 cell phone cases, belt clips, and 
protectors, though I’ve found that those add-on items are purely for 
decorative or fashion purposes and don’t even prevent serious damage 
if you drop the phone.
Backing it up
A backup is a safety copy of the information on your Droid 2. It includes the 
contact information, music, photos, video, and apps you’ve installed, plus 
any settings you’ve made to customize your phone. Copying that information 
to another source is one way to keep the information safe, in case anything 
happens to the phone.
On your Google account, information is backed up automatically. This 
information includes your Contacts list, Gmail messages, and Calendar app 
appointments. Because the Droid 2 automatically syncs this information with 
the Internet, a backup is always present.
To confirm that your Google account information is being backed up, heed 
these steps:
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Launcher button.
 
2. Choose My Accounts.

 Chapter 23: Maintenance and Troubleshooting
 
3. Choose your Google account.
 
4. Ensure that a green check mark appears by every option.
 
 When no check mark is there, touch the gray square to add one.
If you have more than one Google account synchronized with the Droid 2, 
repeat these steps for each account.
Beyond your Google account, which is automatically backed up, you can use 
the Verizon app Backup Assistant to create, on Verizon computers, a safety 
copy of all your phone’s contact information.
To use Backup Assistant, you must configure it on your Droid 2; plus, you 
must create an account on the Verizon Web site.
Configure Backup Assistant by starting the app from the Applications Tray: 
Accept the licensing terms and conditions, create a PIN, and follow the direc-
tions to set up the account. Touch the Sync Now button to start the backup.
On a computer, you can visit the Verizon Web site to complete the process:
www.verizonwireless.com/backupassistant
Create an account by following the directions on the site. After the account is 
created and you log in, you can access the backup copy of the contact infor-
mation on your Droid 2.
Where to find phone information
Who knows what evil lurks inside the heart of 
your phone? Well, the phone itself knows. You 
can view information about the battery, phone 
number, mobile network, and uptime, plus other 
information. To see that trivia, summon the 
Settings app and choose About Phone and then 
Status.
For specific information about your account, 
such as minutes used and data transmitted, you 
have two choices.
First, you can dial the special phone numbers 
included in the Contacts list to get some account 
usage and payment information. Contacts such 
as #MIN and #BAL are used to retrieve your 
minutes (usage) and account balance. See 
Chapter 8 for more information on those special 
contacts.
Second, you can visit the cellular service’s 
Web site. In the United States, the Droid 2 is 
supported by the Verizon Wireless network 
at the time this book goes to press. The Web 
site is www.verizonwireless.com. You 
need to set up or access your account, which 
then leads you to information about your phone 
usage and billing and other trivia.

Part V: Hither and Thither 
 
There’s no native way to back up the data on the Droid 2 MicroSD card to 
your computer. That backup would include all data on your phone — even 
photos, videos, and music. To do this type of backup, you must manually 
copy the information from the MicroSD card to another location, such as 
your computer. That backup, or safety, copy of the information on the 
MicroSD card lets you restore those files to the MicroSD, in case anything 
bad happens to the phone.
For more information on copying the information from the MicroSD card, 
refer to a reference document for your computer’s operating system that 
covers copying files. Because the Droid 2 can be mounted to your computer’s 
storage system like an external storage device (a USB drive), the operation 
isn’t overly complex, though it requires more explanation than I have room 
for in this tome.
Updating the system
Every so often, a new version of your phone’s operating system becomes 
available. It’s an Android update because Android is the name of the Droid 2 
operating system, not because your phone thinks that it’s some type of robot.
When an automatic update occurs, you see an alert or a message appear 
on the phone, indicating that a system upgrade is available. You have three 
choices:
 
✓ Install Now
 
✓ Install Later
 
✓ More Info
My advice is to choose Install Now and get it over with — unless you have 
something (a call, a message, or another urgent item) pending on the phone, 
in which case you can choose Install Later and be bothered by the message 
again.
 
You can manually check for updates: From the Settings screen, choose About 
Phone and then choose System Updates. When your system is up-to-date, the 
screen tells you so. Otherwise, you find directions for updating the system.
Help and Troubleshooting
Things aren’t as bad as they were in the old days. Back then, you could try 
two sources for help: the atrocious manual that came with your electronic 
device or a phone call to the guy who wrote the atrocious manual. It was 
unpleasant. Today, things are better. You have many resources for solving 
issues with your gizmos, including the Droid 2.

Getting help
The Droid 2 comes with a modicum of assistance for your weary times of 
woe. Granted, its advice and delivery method aren’t as informative or enter-
taining as the book you hold in your hands. But it’s something!
To get help, open the Help Center app, found on the Applications Tray. You 
see four categories:
Guided Tours: Videos to help you use your phone
Tips and Tricks: Suggestions for doing things you may not know about
Users Guide: Documentation for the Droid 2
FAQs: Frequently asked questions and their answers
Choosing some of the items displays information stored on your phone. For 
other categories, you’re whisked off to the Internet for details.
Some of the information presented is pretty good, but also pretty basic. It’s 
also, at its core, simply what would have once been printed and bundled with 
the Droid 2: the dratted manual.
Fixing random and annoying problems
Aren’t all problems annoying? There isn’t really such a thing as a welcome 
problem, unless the problem is welcome because it diverts attention from 
another, preexisting problem. And random problems? If problems were pre-
dictable, they would serve in office. Or maybe they already are?
Here are some typical problems and my suggestions for a solution:
General trouble: For just about any problem or minor quirk, consider 
restarting the phone: Turn off the phone, and then turn it on again. That pro-
cedure will most likely fix a majority of the annoying and quirky problems 
you encounter with the Droid 2.
When restarting doesn’t work, consider turning off the Droid 2 and removing 
its battery. Wait about 15 seconds, and then return the battery to the phone 
and turn on the phone again.
Check the data connection: Sometimes, the data connection drops but the 
phone connection stays active. Check the status bar. If you see bars, you 
have a phone signal. When you don’t see the G, E, 3G, or Wi-Fi icon, the 
phone has no data signal.

Part V: Hither and Thither 
Sometimes, the data signal just drops for a minute or two. Wait and it comes 
back around. If it doesn’t, the cellular data network might be down, or you 
may just be in an area with lousy service. Consider changing your location.
For wireless connections, you have to ensure that the Wi-Fi is set up properly 
and working. That usually involves pestering the person who configured the 
Wi-Fi signal or made it available, such as the cheerful person in the green 
apron who serves you coffee.
Music begins to play while you’re on the phone: I find this quirk most 
annoying. For some reason, you start to hear music playing while you’re in a 
conversation on the phone. I wonder why the phone’s software doesn’t dis-
able music from even being able to play while the phone is in use.
Anyway, it might seem like stopping the music is impossible. It’s not: Press 
the Home soft button to go to the Home screen. (You might have to unlock 
the phone.) Pull down the notifications and choose the Music Playing notifi-
cation. Press the Pause button to pause the music.
The MicroSD card is busy: Most often, the MicroSD card is busy because 
you’ve connected the Droid 2 to a computer and the computer is access-
ing the phone’s storage system. To unbusy the MicroSD card, unmount the 
phone or stop the USB storage. See Chapter 13.
When the MicroSD card remains busy, consider restarting the phone, as 
described earlier in this section.
An app has run amok: Sometimes, apps that misbehave let you know. You 
see a warning on the screen announcing the app’s stubborn disposition. 
Touch the Force Close button to shut down the errant app.
When you don’t see a warning or when an app appears to be unduly obsti-
nate, you can shut ’er down the manual way, by following these steps:
 
1. From the Applications Tray, choose the Settings icon.
 
2. Choose Applications.
 
3. Choose Manage Applications.
 
 If you choose the Running tab from the top of the screen, you see a list 
of only the apps that are running, which helps narrow your choices.
 
4. Choose the application that’s causing you distress.
 
 For example, a program doesn’t start or says that it’s busy or has some 
other issue.
 
5. Touch the Force Stop button.
 
 The program stops, if it’s running.

311
 Chapter 23: Maintenance and Troubleshooting
After stopping the program, try opening it again to see whether it works. If 
the program continues to run amok, contact its developer: Open the Market 
app and choose Downloads. Open the app you’re having trouble with and 
choose the option Send Email to Developer. Send the developer a message 
describing the problem.
 
Reset the phone’s software (a drastic measure): When all else fails, you can 
do the drastic thing and reset all the phone’s software, essentially returning 
it to the state it was in when it first arrived. Obviously, you need not per-
form this step lightly. In fact, consider finding support (see the next section) 
before you start:
 
 
1. From the Home screen, touch the Menu button.
 
2. Choose Settings.
 
3. Choose Privacy.
 
4. Choose Factory Data Reset.
 
5. Touch the Reset Phone button.
 
6. Touch the Erase Everything button to confirm.
 
 All the information you’ve set or stored on the phone is purged.
Again, do not follow these steps unless you’re certain that they will fix the 
problem or you’re under orders to do so from someone in Tech Support.
Getting support
The easiest way to find support for the Droid 2 is to dial 611. You’re greeted 
by a cheerful Verizon employee, or an automated robot system, who will 
gladly help you with various phone issues.
On the Internet, you can find support at these Web sites:

Part V: Hither and Thither 
“The touchscreen doesn’t work!”
A touchscreen, such as the one used on the Droid 2, requires a human finger 
for proper interaction. The phone interprets complicated electromagnetic 
physics between the human finger and the phone to determine where the 
touchscreen is being touched.
You cannot use the touchscreen when you’re wearing gloves, unless they’re 
specially designed gloves that claim to work on touchscreens. Batman wears 
this type of glove, so it probably exists in real life.
The touchscreen might also fail when the battery power is low or when the 
phone has been physically damaged.
“The onscreen keyboard is too small!”
It’s not that the onscreen keyboard is too small — it’s that you’re a human 
being and not a marsupial. Your fingers are too big!
 
You can rotate the phone to landscape orientation to see a larger onscreen 
keyboard. Not every app may feature a landscape-orientation keyboard. 
When one does, you’ll find typing on the wider onscreen keyboard much 
easier than normal.
“The battery doesn’t charge”
Start from the source: Is the wall socket providing power? Is the cord plugged 
in? The cable may be damaged, so try another cable.
When charging from a USB port on a computer, ensure that the computer is 
turned on. Most computers don’t provide USB power when they’re turned off.
“The phone gets so hot that it turns itself off!”
Yikes! An overheating phone can be a nasty problem. Judge how hot the 
phone is by seeing whether you can hold it in your hand: When the phone is 
too hot to hold, it’s too hot. If you’re using the phone to warm up your coffee, 
the phone is too hot.
Turn off the phone. Take out the battery and let it cool.
If the overheating problem continues, have the phone looked at for potential 
repair. The battery might need to be replaced.

 Chapter 23: Maintenance and Troubleshooting
 
Do not continue to use a phone that’s too hot! The heat damages the phone’s 
electronics. It can also start a fire.
“The phone doesn’t do Landscape mode!”
Not every app takes advantage of the Droid 2’s ability to orient itself in 
Landscape mode. For example, the Home screen doesn’t “do landscape” unless 
you extend the sliding keyboard. One program that definitely does Landscape 
mode is Browser, described in Chapter 11. So, just because an app doesn’t 
enter Landscape mode doesn’t mean that it can enter Landscape mode.
The Droid 2 has a setting you can check to confirm that landscape orienta-
tion is active: From the Applications Tray, choose Settings and then choose 
the Display category. Ensure that a check mark appears by the item Auto-
Rotate Screen. If not, touch the square to put a green check mark there.

Ten Tips, Tricks, and Shortcuts
In This Chapter
▶ Accessing recent apps
▶ Formatting your email
▶ Halting unnecessary services
▶ Making the keyboard more usable
▶ Adding words to the dictionary
▶ Getting to settings and notifications quickly
▶ Adding direct-dial widgets
▶ Using sliding-keyboard menu shortcuts
▶ Finding a lost phone
▶ Creating event locations
I
’d like to think that everything I mention in this book is 
a tip, trick, or shortcut for using your Droid 2. Given 
that this is a Part of Tens chapter, however, I have the 
freedom to simply list what I feel are ten tips, tricks, 
and shortcuts. These are some of the things I’ve 
learned from using the Droid 2 and from overcom-
ing some of its more frustrating aspects.
Summon a Recently Opened App
I have to kick myself in the head every time I return 
to the Applications Tray to, once again, scroll the list o’ 
icons to dig up an app I just opened. Why bother? Because I 
can press and hold the Home soft button to instantly see a list of 
recently opened apps.
 
Pressing and holding the Home soft button works no matter what you’re 
doing with the phone; you don’t necessarily have to view the Home screen to 
see the list of recently opened apps.

Formatted Email
The email messages I receive from cell phones all have the same telltale 
formatting: Boring. That’s because most cell phone email programs lack any 
formatting abilities. What you send is plain text.
Yawn.
On the Droid 2, however, you can format your email all nice and fancy. Figure 
24-1 describes what’s up with the email composition screen, used by the 
Email app.

1. Start the Email program.
 
2. If necessary, choose an email account.
 
 For example, if you see the combined inbox, choose a specific account.
 
3. Press the Menu soft button.
 
 
4. Choose Email Settings.
 
5. Choose Compose Options.
 
 You can set the email font for all outgoing messages by making changes 
in the top part of the screen: Use the controls illustrated in Figure 24-2 
to manipulate the preset text in the window.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Text formatting can also be applied to your email signature, as shown in 
Figure 24-2. In fact, you can edit your email signature as illustrated in the 
figure.
 
✓ Touch a format button once to turn the format on, and again to turn it off.
 
✓ Multiple formats can be applied to your text.
 
✓ When a text format has been chosen, it appears outlined in red.
 
✓ The Font menu (refer to Figure 24-1) contains four items that deal with 
the text font in your messages: F to select the font type; Tt to select the 
text size; T to select the text foreground color; and a paint bucket to set 
the background color.
 
✓ Text formatting is applied to new text you write or to selected blocks of 
text. See Chapter 4 for information on selecting text.
 
✓ See Chapter 10 for more information about email on your Droid 2.
Stop Unneeded Services
Some things may be going on in your Droid 2 that you don’t need or even 
suspect. These things are computer activities, usually the monitoring of 
information or the phone’s status. The technical term for these activities is 
services.
When a service has started that you don’t want or have been requested to 
stop, you can halt the service. This procedure isn’t one you should take 
lightly, and stopping a service has no amazing power to boost your Droid 2’s 
performance (no matter what you read on the blogs).
When a service needs to be stopped, here’s how it’s done:
 
 
1. While at the Home screen, press the Menu soft button.
 
2. Choose Settings.
 
3. Choose Applications.
 
4. Choose Running Services.
 
5. Touch a service to stop it.
 
 Most likely, it’s a service you recognize that you don’t need, a service 
that has run amok and cannot otherwise be stopped, or a service you’ve 
been directed to disable from another source or authority.

 Chapter 24: Ten Tips, Tricks, and Shortcuts
 
 As an example, I’ve stopped the Skype Mobile service from running 
because I don’t need it. I’ve also stopped the Blockbuster service for the 
same reason.
 
6. Touch the Stop button to halt the service.
When you stop a service, you free the phone resources used by that service, 
including memory and processor power.
The service may start up again the next time you start the phone. If so, and if 
you still need to stop that service, consider uninstalling the program associ-
ated with that service.
 
Do not randomly disable services. Many of them are required in order for the 
Droid 2 to do its job, or for programs you use to carry out their tasks. If you 
disable a service you don’t recognize and the phone begins to act funny, turn 
it off and then on again to fix the problem.
Set Keyboard Feedback
Typing on a touchscreen keyboard isn’t easy. Along with the screen being 
tiny (or your fingers being big), it’s difficult to tell what you’re typing. You 
can add some feedback to the typing process. Heed these steps:
 
 
1. While at the Home screen, press the Menu soft button.
 
2. Choose Settings.
 
3. Choose Language & Keyboard.
 
4. Choose Multi-Touch Keyboard.
 
5. Put a check mark by the option Vibrate On Keypress.
 
 This option causes physical feedback when you press a “key” on the 
onscreen keyboard.
 
6. Put a check mark by the option Sound On Keypress.
 
 The Droid 2 makes a sound when you type on the onscreen keyboard. 
Clackity-clack-clack.
Of the two options, I prefer Sound On Keypress. The phone makes a differ-
ent sound for the character keys and the space key, which reminds me of my 
ancient typewriter.
 
✓ Yeah, keypress is two words: key press.
 
✓ Obviously, these steps don’t apply to using Swype. See Chapter 4 for 
information on using the Swype keyboard.

Add a Word to the Dictionary
Betcha didn’t know that the Droid 2 has a dictionary. The dictionary is used 
to keep track of words you type — words that may not be recognized as 
being spelled properly.
To add a word to the Droid 2 dictionary, long-press the word immediately 
after you type it. From the menu that appears, choose the Add “Word” to 
Dictionary command, where Word is the word you want to add. (Refer to 
Figure 4-14, in Chapter 4.)
You can also choose the word when it appears in the list of suggestions, as 
shown in Figure 24-3. Long-press the word, as shown in the figure, to add it to 
the dictionary. The confirmation that appears is your clue that the word has 
been added.

Long-press the word
Figure 24-3: Adding a word to

To review the contents of the dictionary, open the Settings app and choose 
Language & Keyboard and then User Dictionary. You see a list of words 
you’ve added. Touch a word to edit it or to delete it from the dictionary.

 Chapter 24: Ten Tips, Tricks, and Shortcuts
Quickly Access Settings and Notifications
 
 A Settings icon lives on the Application Tray. But, O, it’s so far away. An 
easier choice is to press the Menu soft button while viewing the Home 
screen. Choose the Settings command.
Another common frustration is accessing the notifications. Though you 
can pull down the notifications when using any app on the phone, you 
can also summon the list from the Home screen by pressing the Menu soft 
button and choosing Notifications. I had to resort to this technique a few 
times when my fingertips utterly failed at pulling down the notifications and 
making them stick.
 
 You can roll up the notifications by pressing the Back soft button.
Create a Direct-Dial Screen Widget
For the numbers you dial most frequently, use the Favorites list, as described 
in Chapter 5. For your überfavorites, you use Home screen direct-dial wid-
gets. Here’s how to create a direct-dial contact widget on the Home screen 
for someone you call frequently:
 
1. Long-press the Home screen.
 
2. Choose Motorola Widgets.
 
3. Choose Contact Quick Task.
 
4. Choose the contact you want to direct-dial.
 
5. Choose the phone number, if the contact has multiple phones.
 
 Choose the number from the top portion of the contact’s information, in 
the Call category.
 
6. Touch the Done button.
The contact’s phone number (and picture, if they have one) appears on the 
Home screen as a widget. Touching the phone icon on the widget summons 
a dialing menu; if you touch the check box, you enable one-touch dialing for 
that contact.
The Quick Contact widget can be resized: Long-press it and then drag the 
corners around with your finger to resize. You can make the Quick Contact 
widget as large or as small as you like. I prefer smaller, especially when the 
contact has an ugly picture attached.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
You can also create an icon to directly text-message a contact. The difference 
is that you choose a phone number from the Text Message list in Step 5 
rather than from the Call category.
See Chapter 9 for more information about text messaging.
Use Sliding-Keyboard Menu Shortcuts
Occasionally, you see a menu command that features a little bit of text 
beneath it, similar to what’s shown in Figure 24-4. That’s a sliding-keyboard 
menu shortcut. You can use these shortcuts to quickly access commands 
that you would otherwise have to activate by touching the screen or fum-
bling with the arrow keys.
Sliding-keyboard shortcut
Menu
Figure 24-4: A sliding-keyboard menu shortcut.
To work a menu shortcut, press the key associated with the command. 
For example, in Figure 24-4, you press the C key to activate the Clear Map 
command.
 
✓ When there are no keyboard shortcuts, you use the sliding keyboard’s 
arrow keys to navigate the menus. Press the OK key to choose a command.
 
✓ Lamentably, not every app features sliding-keyboard shortcuts in the 
commands.

Find Your Lost Cell Phone
Someday, you’re going to lose your beloved Droid 2. It might be for a panic-
filled few seconds, or it might be forever. The hardware solution is to weld 
a chain to your phone, which kind of defeats the whole mobile/wireless 
paradigm. The software solution is to use a cell phone locator service. Cell 
phone locator services take advantage of a phone’s GPS ability to help find 
your phone wherever it’s hiding (on this planet, anyway). Multiple apps, also 
available at the Android Market, can help you locate and, you hope, recover a 
wandering phone.
I’ve tried a few of these programs and can’t recommend any in particular. 
Some you can try are
 
✓ LocService
 
✓ Mobile Defense
 
✓ Mobile Phone Locator Lite
 
✓ Phoning Pigeon
At the time this book goes to press, Mobile Defense is a closed beta. 
Hopefully, soon it will be released.
Most of these services require that you set up a Web page account to assist 
in locating your phone. They also enable services that send updates to the 
Internet. The updates assist in tracking your phone, in case it becomes lost 
or stolen.
Check my Wambooli Web site for any updates regarding apps that help you 
locate a lost phone:
www.wambooli.com/help/phone
Enter Location Information for Your Events
When you create an event for the Calendar app, be sure to enter the event’s 
location. You can type either an address (if you know it) or the name of 
the location. The key is to type the text as you would in the Map app when 
searching for a location. That way, you can touch the event location and the 
Droid 2 displays it on the touchscreen. Finding an address couldn’t be easier.
 
✓ See Chapter 15 for more information about the Maps app.
 
✓ See Chapter 19 for details about the Calendar.

Ten Things to Remember
In This Chapter
▶ Locking the phone
▶ Using landscape orientation
▶ Taking advantage of the arrow keys
▶ Saving typing time
▶ Minding activities that consume battery power
▶ Checking for phone roaming
▶ Using the + key to dial international calls
▶ Mounting and unmounting the MicroSD card
▶ Taking a picture of your contacts
▶ Using the Search command
I
t’s difficult to narrow the list of all the things to 
remember to only ten items. So even though you’ll 
find ten good things not to forget in this chapter, 
don’t think for a moment that there are only ten. In 
fact, as I remember more, I’ll put them on my Web 
site, www.wambooli.com. Check there for updates 
about the Droid 2, and perhaps even more things to 
remember.
Lock the Phone on a Call
Whether you dialed out or someone dialed in, after you 
start talking, you should lock your phone: Press the Power 
button atop the Droid 2. By doing so, you ensure that the touch-
screen is disabled and the call isn’t unintentionally disconnected.
www.it-ebooks.info
WWW.EBOOK777.COM

free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Of course, the call can still be disconnected by a dropped signal or the other 
party getting all huffy and hanging up on you, but by locking the phone, you 
prevent a stray finger or your pocket from disconnecting (or muting) the phone.
Landscape Orientation
Too many times, I find myself using my phone and cursing my stubby fingers. 
Then I slap myself in the forehead and tilt the phone to its side. Yes, sir — 
landscape orientation comes to the rescue. Some applications give you a 
wider screen view, a larger keyboard, and more room to touch buttons in 
landscape orientation.
 
Not every app supports landscape orientation.
Use the Arrow Keys
Even though I’m a big fan of the onscreen keyboard, the sliding keyboard has 
something that comes in quite handy: arrow keys. You can use them to edit 
text better than you can stab your finger on the screen to move the cursor.
The best use of the arrow keys is for hopping between links on a Web page: 
Use the keys to move between links, left, right, up, or down. Press the OK key 
to “click” a link.
The arrow keys might also be used in certain games to move around your 
little man and shoot his various weapons.
Use the Keyboard Suggestions
Don’t forget to take advantage of the suggestions that appear above the 
onscreen keyboard when you’re typing text. In fact, you don’t even need to 
touch a suggestion; to replace your text with the highlighted suggestion, 
simply touch the onscreen keyboard’s space key. Zap! The word appears.
 
✓ The setting that directs the keyboard to make suggestions work is Show 
Suggestions. To ensure that the setting is active, open the Settings app 
and choose Language & Keyboard and then Multi-Touch Keyboard.
 
✓ Refer to Figure 4-6 (in Chapter 4) to see how the onscreen keyboard sug-
gestions work.

 Chapter 25: Ten Things to Remember
Things That Consume Lots of Battery Juice
Three items on the Droid 2 suck down battery power faster than a former 
girlfriend updates her Facebook status to Single:
 
✓ Navigation
 
✓ Bluetooth
 
✓ Wi-Fi networking
Navigation is certainly handy, but because the phone’s touchscreen is on the 
entire time and dictating text to you, the battery drains rapidly. If possible, 
try to plug the phone into the car’s power socket when you’re navigating. If 
you can’t, keep an eye on the battery meter.
Both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networking require extra power for their wireless 
radios. When you need that speed or connectivity, they’re great! I try to plug 
my phone into a power source when I’m accessing Wi-Fi or using Bluetooth. 
Otherwise, I disconnect from those networks as soon as I’m done, to save 
power.
 
✓ Technically speaking, using Wi-Fi doesn’t drain the battery as drastically 
as you would think. In fact, the Wi-Fi signal times itself out after about 
15 minutes of non-use. So it’s perfectly okay to leave Wi-Fi on all day — 
you’ll experience only a modicum of battery loss because of it. Even so, 
I’m a stickler for turning off the Wi-Fi when I don’t use it.
 
✓ See Chapter 23 for more information on managing the Droid 2 battery.
Check for Roaming
Roaming can be expensive. The last non-smartphone (dumbphone?) I owned 
racked up $180 in roaming charges the month before I switched to a better 
cellular plan. Even though you too may have a good cell plan, keep an eye on 
the phone’s status bar. Ensure that when you’re making a call, you don’t see 
the Roaming status icon on the status bar atop the touchscreen.
Well, yes, it’s okay to make a call when your phone is roaming. My advice 
is to remember to check for the icon, not to avoid it. If possible, try to make 
your phone calls when you’re back in your cellular service’s coverage area. 
If you can’t, make the phone call but keep in mind that you will be charged 
roaming fees. They ain’t cheap.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Use + When Dialing Internationally
I suppose most folks are careful when dialing an international number. On 
the Droid 2, you can use the + key to replace the country’s exit code. In 
the United States, that code is 011. So, whenever you see an international 
number listed as 011-xxx-xxxxxxx, you can instead dial +xxx-xxxxxx, 
where the x characters represent the number to dial.
See Chapter 21 for more information on international dialing.
Properly Access the MicroSD Card
To access the Droid 2 storage area using your computer, you must properly 
mount the phone’s MicroSD card. After the card is mounted, you can use 
your computer to access files — music, videos, still pictures, contacts, and 
other types of information — stored on your phone.
When the MicroSD card is mounted on a computer storage system, you 
cannot access the card by using the phone. If you try, you see a message 
explaining that the MicroSD card is busy.
When you’re done accessing the MicroSD card from your computer, be sure 
to stop USB storage: Pull down the USB notification and choose Charge Only. 
Touch the OK button. (See Chapter 13 for more details.)
 
✓ Future releases of the Android operating system may change the way 
the USB connection is made on your Droid 2. See my Web site for more 
information:

✓ Do not simply unplug the phone from the USB cable when the computer 
is accessing the MicroSD card. If you do, you can damage the MicroSD 
card and lose all information stored there.
Snap a Pic of That Contact
Here’s something I always forget: Whenever you’re near one of your contacts, 
take the person’s picture. Sure, some people are bashful, but most folks are 
flattered. The idea is to build up your Contacts list so that all contacts have 
photos. That makes receiving a call much more interesting when you see the 
caller’s picture displayed, especially a silly or embarrassing picture.

 Chapter 25: Ten Things to Remember
 
When taking the picture, be sure to show it to the person before you assign it 
to the contact. Let them decide whether it’s good enough. Or, if you just want 
to be rude, assign a crummy-looking picture. Heck, you don’t even have to do 
that: Just take a random picture of anything and assign it to a contact: A 
plant. A rock. Your cat. But, seriously, keep in mind that the phone can take a 
contact’s picture the next time you meet up with that person.
See Chapter 16 for more information on using the Droid 2 camera and assign-
ing a picture to a contact.
The Search Command
Google is known worldwide for its searching abilities. By gum, the word 
google is now synonymous for searching. So, please don’t forget that the 
Droid 2, which uses the Google Android operating system, has a powerful 
Search command.
 
 The Search command is not only powerful but also available all over. The 
Search soft button can be pressed at any time, in just about any program 
to search for information, locations, people — you name it. It’s handy. It’s 
everywhere. Use it.

Ten Worthy Apps
In This Chapter
▶ AK Notepad
▶ Barcode Scanner
▶ Dolphin Browser
▶ Google Finance
▶ My Settings
▶ Movies
▶ Paper Toss
▶ Ringdroid
▶ SportsTap
▶ Voice Recorder
▶ Zedge
I
’m taking an awful risk. It’s dangerous to claim that 
there are only 10 worthy apps of the more than 
80,000 available at the Android Market — especially 
when I know for certain that I haven’t tried all those 
apps. Still, I would be remiss not to pass along a 
few app suggestions before concluding this book’s 
text. Whittling the list to 10 was difficult, so — in a 
break with For Dummies tradition — this chapter 
contains 11 app suggestions. (Don’t tell anyone!)
All these apps are free. Find them at the Android 
Market. See Chapter 20.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
AK Notepad
 
 One program that the Droid 2 is missing out of the box is a notepad. A good 
choice for an app to fill that void is AK Notepad: You can type or dictate 
short messages and memos, which I find handy.
For example, before a recent visit to the hardware store, I made (dictated) a 
list of items I needed to buy by using AK Notepad. I also keep some important 
items as notes, things that I often forget or don’t care to remember, such as 
frequent flyer numbers, my dress shirt and suit size (like I ever need that 
information), and other important notes I might need handy but not clutter-
ing my brain.
Perhaps the most important note you can make is one containing your con-
tact information. A note labeled In Case You Find This Phone on my Droid 2 
contains information about me in case I ever lose my phone and someone is 
decent enough to search it for my information. (Also see Chapter 24 for infor-
mation on finding a lost phone.)
Barcode Scanner
Many apps from the Android Market can be quickly accessed by scanning 
their barcode information. Scanning with what? Why, your Droid 2, of course!
By using an app such as Barcode Scanner, you can instantly read in and 
translate barcodes to product descriptions, Web page links, or links directly 
to apps in the Android Market.
Using Barcode Scanner in this chapter
Throughout this chapter, you find barcode 
icons. After installing Barcode Scanner (or 
a similar) app, use your Droid 2 to scan the 
barcodes. Touch the Open Browser button 
to download the recommended app from the 
Android Market.
Additional app recommendations and their bar-
codes are found all over the Internet, in maga-
zines, and on my Android phone support page at 
www.wambooli.com/help/phone.

 Chapter 26: Ten Worthy Apps
Though you can find similar barcode-scanning apps, I find Barcode Scanner 
the easiest to use: Run the app, point the phone’s camera at a barcode, and, 
in a few moments, you see a link or an option suggesting what to do next. To 
get an app, the Open Browser option takes you to the Android Market, where 
downloading the app is just a few touches away.
Dolphin Browser
 
 Though I don’t mind using the Browser app that comes with the Droid 2, it’s 
despised by many Android phone owners. A better and more popular alterna-
tive is Dolphin Browser.
Like many popular computer browsers, Dolphin Browser features a tabbed 
interface, which works much better than the silly multiple window interface 
of the standard Browser app on the Droid 2.
The Dolphin Browser also sports many handy tools, which you can access by 
pressing the Menu soft key. Unlike in other Android apps, the tools pop up on 
a menu you can see on the screen.
If you grow fond of the Dolphin Browser, follow the customization directions 
in Chapter 22 to remove the Browser app’s icon from the Home screen and 
place the Dolphin Browser there instead.
Google Finance
 
 The Google Finance app is an excellent market-tracking tool for folks who are 
obsessed with the stock market or want to keep an eye on their portfolios. 
The app offers you an overview of the market and updates to your stocks as 
well as links to financial news.
To get the most benefit from this app, configure Google Finance on the Web, 
using your computer. You can create lists of stocks to watch, which are then 
instantly synchronized with your Droid 2. You can visit Google Finance on 
the Web at
www.google.com/finance
As with other Google services, Google Finance is provided to you for free, as 
part of your Google account.

Movies
 
 The Movies app is the Droid 2 gateway to Hollywood. It lists currently run-
ning films and films that are opening, and it has links to your local theaters 
with showtimes and other information. The app is also tied into the popular 
Rotten Tomatoes Web site for reviews and feedback. If you enjoy going to the 
movies, you’ll find the Movies app a valuable addition to your Droid 2.
MySettings
 
 The Droid 2 has many settings and even more places buried on the phone 
where you have to go to change those settings: Brightness. Volume. 
Bluetooth. Wi-Fi. Changing them isn’t a challenge when you install the 
MySettings app.
The simple idea of MySettings is to place all common phone settings on one 
screen. You can turn settings on or off or make adjustments without having 
to venture down into the deep, dark recesses of the Settings screens. This 
app is easy to use and pure genius.
Paper Toss
 
 Yeah, Paper Toss is a game. The object is simple: Toss a crumpled piece of 
paper into a trashcan. The trashcan appears in varying locales and at differ-
ent distances. Your nemesis is a circulating fan, which affects the arc of your 
throw. My record is ten in a row. And I love the polite “golf clapping” that 
takes place after each successful shot. It’s a clever and addicting game.
Ringdroid
 
 The Ringdroid app lets you customize and create ringtones for the Droid 2. 
You can either snip a segment of music already on your phone or use the 
phone to record your own ringtone. This one-purpose app does its only job 
quite well.

 Chapter 26: Ten Worthy Apps
SportsTap
 
 I admit to not being a sports nut, so I have difficulty identifying with the crav-
ing to have the latest scores, news, and schedules. The sports nuts in my life, 
however, tell me that the best app for that purpose is a handy app named 
SportsTap.
Rather than blather on about something I’m not into, just take my advice and 
obtain SportsTap. I believe you’ll be thrilled.
Voice Recorder
 
 The Droid 2 can record your voice or other sounds, and the Voice Recorder 
is a good app for performing that task. It has an elegant and simple interface: 
Touch the big Record button to start recording. Make a note for yourself or 
record a friend doing his Daffy Duck impression.
Previous recordings are stored in a list on the Voice Recorder’s main screen. 
Each recording is shown with its title, the date and time of the recording, and 
the recording duration.
Zedge
 
 Zedge is the eleventh item, but it’s a good one: The Zedge program is a help-
ful resource for finding wallpapers and ringtones for the Droid 2. It’s a shar-
ing app, so you can access wallpapers and ringtones created by other 
Android phone users as well as share your own.
Zedge features an easy-to-use interface plus lots of helpful information on 
what it does and how it works.
