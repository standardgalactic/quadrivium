About the Author
Sheryl Garrett, CFP® and founder of The Garrett Planning Network, Inc., has been dubbed
“The All-American Planner,” possibly because of her zealous mission to “help make compe-
tent, objective financial advice accessible to all people” and partly because she’s just an all-
American gal from Kansas.
Growing up in a working-class family and even setting out to get her first job at age 8, Sheryl
was (and is) a consummate schemer and planner, which made financial planning a great fit
for her. In 1998, Sheryl struck out on her own and designed her financial advisory shop
to service clients in a way that she’d want to receive services. Sheryl’s fresh approach —
working with clients on an hourly, as-needed, fee-only basis — has evolved into an interna-
tional network of independent financial advisors and a charitable foundation that is helping
Sheryl fulfill her personal mission.
As a consumer advocate, Sheryl has been honored to work with the House Subcommittee on
Financial Services regarding predatory lending regulation and the United States’ need for
financial literacy and Social Security reform. She also enjoys her involvement with the finan-
cial planning departments at Kansas State University, The University of Missouri, and Texas
Tech University, as well as the Kansas Counsel on Economic Education. Most recently, 
Sheryl has become ignited by her work “going after the bad guys” by consulting and testify-
ing as an expert witness in lawsuits against financial advisors who rendered inappropriate
financial advice.
Sheryl has also authored or served as a technical editor on more than a dozen books and a
couple monthly magazine columns. These books include Garrett’s Guide to Financial Planning
(National Underwriter), Just Give Me the Answer$ (Dearborn Trade), Money Without
Matrimony (Dearborn Trade), as well as this book, Personal Finance Workbook For Dummies
(Wiley).
Sheryl has been interviewed on CNNfn, Bloomberg, ABC World News Now, Fox-TV, NPR’s
All Things Considered and Marketplace, and in Business Week, Newsweek, Time, Forbes,
Kiplinger Personal Finance, Money, Smart Money, MarketWatch, U.S. News & World Report,
the New York Times, USA Today, and the Wall Street Journal. For four straight years, Sheryl
was recognized by Investment Advisor magazine as “One of the Top 25 Most Influential People
in Financial Planning.”


Dedication
I dedicate this book to everyone who believes that knowledge is power — power to change
things for the better and power to make a positive difference in our lives and the lives of
those whom we love. 
I have an extra-special dedication to my daughter Claire. Although we haven’t met yet,
this book has kept me preoccupied during the long wait for our forever family. Hurry home,
baby — Momma’s getting restless! 


Author’s Acknowledgments
Because of the love and devotion of my family, staff, and colleagues in the Garrett Planning
Network, I have the freedom and support to carry out my life’s work, which involves my pas-
sion to help make competent, objective financial advice accessible to all people. The For
Dummies folks share this vision.
Thank you, Eric Tyson, for allowing me the honor to serve as technical editor of Personal
Finance For Dummies and for suggesting that I write this workbook. Your support and confi-
dence is most appreciated. And thank you, Randy Gardner, for helping me not disappoint you
when you call me the greatest financial planner in the world. Without your technical review,
comments, and suggestions, I might have embarrassed both of us. Also, many thanks to Mike
Baker, Kelly Ewing, Sarah Westfall, and the great team behind the scenes at Wiley Publishing
for all their hard work.
But most of all, thank you — the reader — for taking the initiative to achieve financial success!

Personal Finance Workbook For Dummies 

Introduction
D
o the terms personal finance or money management dredge up feelings of inadequacy,
confusion, discomfort, or fear in you? If so, you’re not alone. Many people dread any-
thing that relates to money for many reasons. Perhaps you find yourself lacking adequate
income to support your lifestyle, or you’re swimming in debt. You may love to just stop
thinking about money for a while, but unfortunately, you just can’t get away from it.
Enter Personal Finance Workbook For Dummies. I wrote this book to help you purge any nega-
tive feelings you’ve had regarding your personal finances, and I promise that no matter where
you find yourself, you can improve your financial situation. All you need is to be informed,
motivated, and dedicated; you can do it, and this workbook can help.
Personal finance isn’t rocket science, but because so much misinformation and so many self-
serving nut cases are out there, differentiating all the great stuff from the garbage can be quite
a chore. The financial services industry, the media, and many authors benefit by keeping you
dazed and confused. Others would prefer to lead you dreaming of how easy it will be to retire
in style, on the beach somewhere, in better shape than you’ve ever been in your life — if you
only hire them or buy their magazine, book, or too-good-to-be-true system. However, I chose
to keep it good and simple.
I crammed Personal Finance Workbook For Dummies with the tools and strategies you need
to make smarter decisions about your personal finances. As an informed money manager,
you’re empowered to save money, simplify your life, and achieve your most cherished finan-
cial life goals, so invest a little time on your personal finances. I promise you’ll be forever
glad you did.
About This Book
Personal Finance Workbook For Dummies is designed for you to use as a hands-on workbook
for all the major subjects involving your personal finances. If you’re like most people, you
really don’t want or don’t have the time to read an entire book cover to cover — let alone,
work through an entire workbook on personal finances. If I’ve just described you, just turn
to the Index or the Table of Contents and zero in on the issue you currently have questions
about. Zone in on the chapter or section that addresses your specific need at this time. Then
refer back to this workbook each time you have additional questions or areas about your
personal financial lives that you’d like to improve.
But, if you’re a nerd like me and just enjoy this stuff, proceed step by step through the entire
workbook! By working through this book page by page, you can develop a comprehensive
financial plan for yourself.
This workbook can help you develop your own personal financial plan or simply get the
answers to your personal financial questions. However, due to the nature of this workbook,
you won’t find a lot of text providing definitions or explanations about all things personal
finance. Should you desire or need to augment your knowledge gained in this book —
no worries. I recommend checking out Personal Finance For Dummies by Eric Tyson, also
published by Wiley, or you can use some of the great resources I’ve included all throughout
this workbook.

Conventions Used in This Book
While writing this workbook, I used a few conventions throughout its pages in order to
make your life just a bit easier. Here’s what you can expect:
 I use italics when I define a word or phrase that’s important to understanding a
topic. And when I get especially excited, I may throw in some italics for a little
extra emphasis.
 When you see text in bold, you can expect it to be either a step in a numbered
list or a key word in a bulleted list.
 All Web addresses appear in monofont.
 When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break
across two lines of text. If that happened, know that I haven’t put in any extra
characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using one of these
Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book or on the Cheat
Sheet and ignore the line break.
Foolish Assumptions
Don’t be afraid, but I have some preconceived ideas about you, my dear reader. In order
to provide the tools and advice you need, I made some of the following assumptions:
 You passed fourth-grade math. You need a few basic math skills to work through
some of the exercises in this workbook; however, I added instructions and exam-
ples to make it as easy as possible to complete the exercises. And, unlike your
fourth-grade math class, the results of these homework assignments can have an
immediate positive impact on your finances.
 You don’t want to become victim of self-serving sales pitches, struggle to make
ends meet, or become a bag lady. You want to become empowered to achieve
financial security.
 You have some interest in taking a more active and productive role in managing
your personal financial life, or at least want to make sure that you don’t do any-
thing really stupid or get ripped off in the scary and dangerous world of financial
products and services.
 You want to create your own financial plan in order to meet your life goals.
 You have access to the Internet. Although Internet access isn’t a requirement,
you can enjoy the tips I share regarding my favorite Web sites for gaining addi-
tional information, products, or services, for everything you need to manage
your personal finances.
 You’re no idiot! In fact, you’re so smart you realize that to really get ahead in life
financially, you’ve got to get educated and stay involved. With a little time, energy,
persistence, and determination, you can achieve what you really want in life.
How This Book Is Organized
Personal Finance Workbook For Dummies is organized into six distinct parts, each 
covering a major area involving your personal finances. The following summarizes
what you can find in each part.
2
Personal Finance Workbook For Dummies 

Part I: Getting on the Road to Financial Fitness
The chapters in this part help you get focused and motivated to achieve your financial
dreams. You can use the worksheets and tips in these chapters to begin to simplify
and better manage your current financial life so that you can achieve what matters
most to you. If you can measure it, you can manage it. If you can manage it, you can
achieve it. This part gets you started.
Part II: Getting the Most Out of Your Money
In this part, I get into the when’s and how’s to use credit to your advantage. I provide
you tools to help you get the most out of your money when grocery shopping, enter-
taining, or paying your taxes and provide hands-on suggestions to get your family
onboard with your financial plans.
Part III: Thinking about the Future
What do you want out of your financial life — to have a comfortable home, to be able
to educate your kids, to retire someday, or at least have that choice? What about 
planning for what you leave behind? Part III focuses exclusively on how best to
approach each of these major life goals and how you can deal with the many options
and opportunities available to you.
Part IV: Building and Managing Wealth
To achieve the goals most important in your financial life, you need to discover and
continue to develop your knowledge of specific investments and investment strategies
that are most appropriate for your goals, options, and comfort with risk. I help you
determine the right way to invest your money to get the biggest bang for your buck,
yet keep it simple, highly effective, and easy to manage.
Part V: Protecting Your Assets
In one quick instant, all you have worked for, all you dream about, could be wiped out.
In this part, I help you understand the risks you face and show you ways to determine
and obtain exactly what you need and how to get it at the best price. You may need
more appropriate insurance or guidance from a professional financial advisor. I help
you determine just exactly what types of insurance coverages you may need and

cially.  You can discover tricks to help take the drudgery
out of personal money management, streamline your
financial records, improve your credit rating, and find out
what truly matters most in your life. If you’re wanting to
get financially fit, this part can get you well on your way.

Chapter 1
Exploring Money in Your Life
In This Chapter
 Understanding attitudes when it comes to money
 Reflecting on the messages you learned as a child
 Recognizing what obstacles stand in the way of your financial progress
B
efore you begin making concrete financial plans, you should explore your history with
money. What messages were you taught, consciously or unconsciously, about money
when you were growing up? How have these messages affected the way you make money
management decisions now? If you’re in a long-term relationship, what lessons did your
spouse or partner learn, and how does your loved one’s money history affect your financial
plans together? In this chapter, I help you delve into and analyze your financial history.
Exploring Your Attitudes about Money
I’m sure you’ve heard people say that they’re “frugal” or “good savers.” However, I find these
statements to be less common than “I’m a bad money manager,” “I don’t know how to
manage money,” “It’s too confusing,” “I’ll never get ahead,” or “I’ll have to work ’til I drop.”
Your thoughts about money influence your actions. Positive thoughts lead to positive money
management behaviors. Negative thoughts lead to financial ruin.
Try to maintain a spirit of open mindedness when you think about your finances, because
your thoughts become reality. For example, if you think you’ll never have financial security,
you may very well give up before you even begin to try. However, if you remain open to
making changes in your financial habits, you’re more likely to succeed. Which reality do you
want? You have the opportunity now to make changes that affect your financial life forever.
Each of us, at one time or another, has experienced discomfort, stress, anxiety, or the feeling
of ignorance about money. However, these attitudes and feelings change. Exploring your cur-
rent attitudes about money is an important step in improving your financial education and
situation.
To help you figure out your current frame of mind when it comes to money, I’ve included
Worksheet 1-1. To use this worksheet, determine how often the statements fit you —
frequently, sometimes, or never? In the blank provided, write F for frequently, S for some-
times, and N for never. Don’t spend a lot of time mulling over the answer — just a few seconds
on each question. And because your attitudes can and do change, respond to these questions
as you feel right now — and go with your gut.

After completing Worksheet 1-1, you should have a pretty good picture of your attitude
and feelings when it comes to money. But to take it a step further, spend a few minutes
writing about your current attitudes and feelings about money; see Worksheet 1-2 as
an example and use the space provided in Worksheet 1-3. This exercise can help you
become more thoughtful and aware of how your thoughts and attitudes toward money
may have evolved and how those thoughts and attitudes are affecting your financial
life today.

Taking Stock of Your Financial History
Your financial history consists of the lessons and messages you heard about money
while growing up. Much of what you are today you owe to your upbringing — whether
good or bad. So it makes sense to reflect on the messages you received and how they
may be impacting your money-management decisions today.
Your parents or primary caregivers may have been somewhat or very secretive about
their personal financial situation; however, what they said and how they acted can
reveal a lot.
I don’t know much about money management. I feel like I ought to know, 
but I don’t. We save a little each month, and we pay extra toward our 
credit-card balances each month. And I’m very happy to say that the 
balances are finally starting to go down. Unfortunately, I feel like I am 
nagging my family every time I turn around. They think I’m becoming a 
miser. My dad was a miser and didn’t live long enough to enjoy it. My 
mother and I would have loved to have had a few niceties like clothes that 
were in fashion, a newer car, and a larger house. But my dad said we 
couldn’t afford it. When it came to money, Dad’s only communication was 
“No.”
I don’t want to turn into my dad, but I do want our family to be financially 
secure.

Chapter 1: Exploring Money in Your Life

Worksheet 1-4 helps you reveal your financial history. Check off each statement that
you heard (or anything darn close to it) from a parent or primary caregiver growing up.
Worksheet 1-4
Figuring Out Your Financial History
❏Money burns a hole in my pocket.
❏Live for today. You never know what tomorrow will bring.
❏Don’t carry cash. You’ll either spend it, or someone will clunk you over the head
and take it.
❏If you want something, you have to work very hard to get it.
❏You’ll never amount to anything.
❏It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of heaven.
❏If you want something, you must be willing to sacrifice.
❏You don’t appreciate how hard I work to put food on the table.
❏If you can’t afford to pay cash for something, you shouldn’t buy it.
❏Neither a lender nor a borrower be.
❏You can accomplish anything you desire in life.
❏Women don’t make as much money as men.
❏Invest in yourself.
❏Diamonds are a girl’s best friend.
❏Your mother or father can’t manage money.
❏Your mother or father hides or lies about purchases.
❏The rich get richer on the backs of working class people like us.
❏I can’t afford to pursue the career of my dreams.
❏If we would have only waited longer before having kids. . .
❏Save it for a rainy day.
Read through the statements in Worksheet 1-4 that you checked off and spend a few
minutes reflecting on the messages you heard as a child and how these messages
may have affected your current attitudes and feelings about money. Ask yourself the
following questions about each of your parents or primary caregivers. (You can use
Worksheet 1-5 as an example if you get stuck.) Write your reflections in Worksheet 1-6.
 Were they spenders or savers? Do you know?
 Did they talk about money around you?
 Did they fight about money?
 What lessons did you learn about money from them?
Many of the messages listed in Worksheet 1-4 are somewhat or very negative belief
statements. Of those that you checked, which do you find potentially negative, and
what effect do you feel these messages may have had on you growing up?

Part I: Getting on the Road to Financial Fitness 

Some people are hoarders, and others are overspenders. Being extreme — on either
end of the spectrum — isn’t healthy. Balance is key. You can’t spend everything today,
or you won’t have anything for tomorrow. You also shouldn’t put off everything you’d
like to do until tomorrow because tomorrow may never come. Finding the appropriate
balance with your time, energy, and money will lead to the best outcome.

Identifying What or Who May Be 
Holding You Back
What unhealthy behaviors or characteristics do you feel you may have picked up 
from your parents or primary caregivers growing up? Using Worksheet 1-8, reflect 
on ways of thinking that you may have picked up and how those messages or behav-
iors you witnessed may be affecting you now. (If you’d like to see an example of 
Example #1:
My father was a good provider — financially speaking. Unfortunately, 
he wasn’t home as much as I would have liked him to be because he 
was constantly working. I regret not having more time with him while I 
was growing up. I don’t know whether he worked to better provide for 
his family, or because he felt he had to, or maybe he was just a 
workaholic. He grew up in a very poor family. He never felt we were 
saving enough.
Example #2:
My mother would like to spend more money than she does. However, 
my father keeps a tight grip on the purse strings in our family. I 
remember a few occasions when my mother bought a new dress or 
pair of shoes, and she hid them from my father in the back of their 
closet. She’d tell me, “By the time I wear them, Dad won’t realize that 
they are new.” And my father may have been too much of a hoarder. 
When he was growing up, his family was broke. I know he didn’t want 
that for us.

Chapter 1: Exploring Money in Your Life

this type of reflection, you can check out Worksheet 1-7.) For example, do you find that
you follow in your “tightwad” father’s footsteps or resent the fact that you weren’t
allowed to buy things that you wanted to when you were younger and have made up
for it — in spades — in your adulthood?

You may hold a grudge, feel taken advantage of, or have animosity toward people in
your financial life. You may also have regrets about decisions you’ve made. So in addi-
tion to the messages you received growing up, what other people or issues do you feel
may be keeping you from realizing your full potential financially? Use Worksheet 1-9 as a
guide to get you thinking (and writing) about what or who may be holding you back
from your financial goals.
Thus far, you’ve been focusing on the messages you learned growing up. In Worksheet
1-9, I’d like you to focus for a moment on other people in your life and how your rela-
tionship with them may be affected by money.
My father felt very strongly that if you want to achieve financial security 
you have to be willing to sacrifice time with family. He felt his job was to 
make money and be a good provider. I got the feeling that money was 
more valuable than his family. I missed my father. I wanted more time 
with him when I was growing up. You can’t replace that with any amount 
of money. I will never let that happen to my kids.
From my mother, I learned that if she wanted something but ought not 
to buy it, she could so long as Dad didn’t know about it. She definitely 
wouldn’t endorse lying, but that is exactly what I learned when it came to 
her relationship with my dad and money. “What he doesn’t know won’t 
hurt him,” she used to say. I’d like to have a more understanding, 
collaborative partnership with my spouse, rather than it being so 
one-sided as it was with my parents.
Throughout my childhood, it became apparent to me that people judge 
you by how much money they think you have. I care about what others 
think of me. But I have to really try not to spend my money on things 
that will impress “them.”

By becoming more aware of your beliefs and attitudes about money and recognizing
how these beliefs influence your relationship with others and with money, you can dis-
cover who or what may be holding you back and possibly how to work through these
challenging issues. The first step is awareness.
Dealing with the Subject of Money
Sharing your financial goals, objectives, quirks, and hang-ups about money with the
people in your life is the best way to overcome perceived or real issues impeding your
personal and your family’s financial success. However, money is the last taboo subject
for most people, and you likely don’t talk about your personal finances with others.

your spouse/partner, kids, parents, friends, and employer. See Worksheet 1-10 for

versations now?

My daughter recently started her first “real” job. She asked me for 
advice regarding whether she should sign up for her retirement plan 
at work. I don’t know much about investing or retirement plans. 
However, I do know that I regret not participating in my employer’s 
retirement plan when I first started working. Because I didn’t, I have 
not saved anywhere near the amount of money I should have by now. 
So I encouraged my daughter to start saving now. The biggest regret 
I have about my financial decisions is that I didn’t start saving a lot 
sooner. Hopefully, I have helped my daughter avoid the same mistake I 
made, by being open and honest with her about my mistakes and 
regrets. Heck, if you can learn from your mistakes and that 
knowledge helps someone else, all is not lost.

Many people avoid talking about money, but trouble brews when couples or families
ignore the topic. You should discuss issues, such as your desires as to what you want
to do with your annual bonus or tax refund, because your spouse or partner may have
very different ideas about using this money. Communication and compromise are
required. Remember, you are in financial partnership with your spouse. Collaborate on
your financial plans together.
You and your spouse/partner are not only romantic and domestic partners; you are
also financial partners.

perhaps with your loved ones or even your employer. Be specific about what needs to

M
oney isn’t just affected by your attitudes, emotions, or beliefs. You do have to con-
sider the cold, hard facts of your finances. Whether you’re a millionaire or living pay-
check to paycheck, this chapter helps you deal with the numbers surrounding money in
your life.
Organizing Your Financial Records
Do you have stacks of unopened bills? Do you stress out at tax time trying to find all your
required documents? Do you have financial records that you don’t know what to do with?
And are you lacking a system for managing all this mess? Well, you aren’t alone. Most people
could use a thorough financial house cleaning right now and a little regular maintenance to
keep their financial records in good shape.
Getting organized takes time, but you’ll be very glad if you do it. Imagine no more late pay-
ments and fees merely because you misplaced a credit-card bill, tax records that you can
organize in minutes rather than hours, and critical information or documents ready at a
moment’s notice.
Organization truly isn’t that hard, although it does take time. So if you’re ready to put an end
to the mess, then the following steps can walk you down the path of organization:
1. Gather all your financial documents, paperwork, bills, and unopened mail.
2. Set up a filing system (refer to Worksheet 2-1).
You can use this worksheet as a guide to organize your personal files. For most of the
primary subjects listed in Worksheet 2-1, you need only one file. (I prefer hanging files,
which you can purchase at any office-supply store.) In this worksheet, the name of
each file is in bold type. You may find that fewer or more files are necessary depending
on your personal situation, preferences, or number of documents you have for a partic-
ular file. I also outline in this worksheet how long you should retain these documents
for your records.
3. Separate your paperwork into four stacks: Bills To Be Paid; To Do/Read; File; 
and Shred.
4. Place the Bills To Be Paid stack into your new Bills Due file; place the papers in your
To Do/Read stack into your new To Do or Read files; file all items in your File stack
in their appropriate files (see Worksheet 2-1); and shred the remaining papers.

Every time you retrieve the mail or obtain additional paperwork from work, from the
bank, and so on, immediately follow Steps 3 and 4.
Worksheet 2-1
Financial Records Filing System
 Advisors: Keep a list of names, addresses, and phone numbers of the important
people in your financial life (refer to Worksheet 2-2).
 Auto: Be sure to include the following for each vehicle:
• Title: Keep as long as you own the vehicle.
• Maintenance Records: Keep as long as you own the vehicle.
 Bank Accounts: This file includes both your checking and savings accounts. For
each account, be sure to include the following in the file:
• Current Monthly Statement: Keep until next statement is received.
• Historic Monthly Bank Statements: Keep until account is reconciled.
 Bills Due: Immediately upon opening mail, file bills due in this file. After you’ve
paid the bills, the file will be empty again.
 Contracts: Keep the following contracts as long as they are in force:
• Legal Agreements
• Employment Contracts
 Credit Cards:
• Current Monthly Statements: Keep until you receive the next statement.
• Historic Monthly Statements: Keep until account is reconciled, at a mini-
mum. However, if you purchased an item that is under warranty through
your credit-card company, or it may be a tax-deductible expense, keep the
record indefinitely. If in doubt, keep.
• Credit Report: Obtain a copy of your credit report for both you and your
spouse at least annually. Retain the report until the new report is received
and compared with the prior report.
• Debt Management Action Plan: This is the score card that you use to keep
track of your debt repayment progress (see Chapter 5).
 Education:
• Enrollment Records
• Diplomas, Certificates
• Grade Cards or Transcripts
• Progress Reports
 Employment:
• Employee Handbook (current)
• Employee Benefits Handbook (current)
• Paycheck Stub (most current only, if cumulative)
• Employee Evaluations (all)
• Resume (current)
• Continuing Education Units (CEU) (all required documentation of CEU
requirements, if applicable)
18
Part I: Getting on the Road to Financial Fitness 

 Healthcare (for informational purposes only):
• Medical Records
• Vaccination Information
• Receipts
 Home Repairs and Maintenance: Retain records for any home services or
repairs — plumbing, electric, lawn maintenance, carpentry, and so on — as well
as any receipts for equipment you may have purchased for as long as you own
the item.
 Insurance: Retain copies of personally owned insurance policies, such as auto,
home, boat, life, disability, long-term care, or any other type of insurance you
may have.
 Investments: 
• Bank Investment Account Statements
• Brokerage Accounts: Although you aren’t required by law to keep your
account application, I suggest that you go ahead and put it in this file. I
recently testified in a lawsuit where the new account application was used
as evidence to help win the case for the victim. Hopefully, you’ll never need
it. You should also keep any notes or correspondence from the broker (for
as long as you own the asset) and prospectuses (the one issued when the
investment was originally made and the most current for each investment
position held), as well as annual reports (keep most current for each
investment position held) and monthly or annual, if cumulative, account
statements (retain indefinitely). Also file any transaction confirmations for
at least three years after the investment is sold.
• Mutual Fund Statements: The documents you need to file include the follow-
ing: account applications (no requirement to keep); notes or correspondence
from your advisor; prospectus (initial and most current); annual report 
(most recent only); monthly account statement (if cumulative, retain current
monthly statement as well as each year-end cumulative statement); and trans-
action confirmations (for at least three years after you sell the investment).
• Retirement Plans: Be sure to retain your summary plan description, invest-
ment options, current account statement (no need to keep it, though, when
the next one comes), and annual account summary statement (leave it in
the file indefinitely).
• IRAs: You need to save your current account statement, any annual account
summary statements (retain indefinitely), and any records of contributions,
both from traditional (deductible and nondeductible) and Roth accounts.
• Other Investments: This category includes rental property, limited partner-
ships, dividend reinvestment plans, and investment club accounts.
 Loans: You need to keep all documents for each loan  — whether a mortgage,
home equity line of credit, or a signature, auto, or school loan — for as long as
the loan is outstanding. This documentation includes proof of payment, as well
as amortization schedules.
 Read: Use this folder as a parking place for important financial reading material
that you’ll get to at a more convenient time, such as an investment account
newsletter that came in the mail. (Retain until completed, dropped, or moved to
a more appropriate file.)
 Tax Records: Be sure to hang on to all receipts, 1099s, paycheck stubs, charita-
ble contributions, and other items pertaining to the current year. In most cases,
you need to keep tax returns and supporting records only for three years; 
however, I keep them indefinitely.
19
Chapter 2: Getting Your Financial House in Order

 To Do (Pending Projects): This category includes to-do items, such as an esti-
mate for work you may have done on your home, or an investment prospectus
that you haven’t read yet. (Retain until completed or dropped.)
 Utilities: Retain current monthly statements for the following: water, gas, elec-
tric, phone (both landline and mobile), as well as cable or satellite TV.
 Warranties: Until the item is no longer under warranty, keep any whole house
warranty as well as any warranty for an appliance or electronic.
 Wills, Trusts, and Estate Planning: File all current, executed estate-planning
documents, as well as a list of beneficiary designations.
Worksheet 2-2 provides you with a master record of all the most important people in
your financial and daily life, including their contact information and your account
numbers, if applicable. It’s really helpful to keep all this information in one place. And
be sure to let your spouse or partner know where to find this list in case anything
happens to you.

What It Reveals about You)
Your net worth statement is simply a listing of all that you own and all that you owe,
and the difference between the two is your net worth. Your net worth is like a financial
report card because it reveals a lot about you. In fact, people tend to be more comfort-
able talking about their sex lives than their financial lives. No one can prove whether
someone has been a fantastic lover. However, one glance at a net worth statement, and
you have a pretty good idea whether a person has made a lot of financial mistakes, had
terrible misfortune, has been a fantastic money manager, or is just darn lucky.
I suggest that you go ahead and figure out your net worth now (using Worksheet 2-3),
and update it each and every year, shortly after year-end, because that is when you
receive the previous year’s year-end statements on your mortgage, retirement
accounts, pension, investments, bank accounts, and a slew of tax-related documents.
This is an excellent time to update your net worth statement.
Don’t beat yourself up over your current financial situation. It does no good; in fact, it
actually is very harmful. Consider this the beginning of your quest for financial free-
dom. The only things that matter are the decisions you make in the present and the
future regarding your financial life. You can’t change the past. However, you can learn
from your successes and failures of the past. Focus on what you can gain from the
exercise in Worksheet 2-3 and then use it to help stay on track going forward.
Your net worth becomes a benchmark that you can use to measure your current finan-
cial status relative to others, relative to where you want to be, and year to year. You
can use Worksheet 2-4 to measure your progress year after year.
Your result from Worksheet 2-3 becomes your first entry in your net worth tracking log
in Worksheet 2-4.

Worksheet 2-4
Financial Net Worth Tracking Log
You’re probably wondering how to interpret all those numbers from Worksheets 2-3
and 2-4. Well, here are a few general guidelines to keep in mind as you think about your
net worth statements:
 Remember that Personal Use Assets aren’t working assets like Investment
Assets. However, they still add to your net worth, which can be very misleading.
Investment Assets are much more valuable then Personal Use Assets. Investment
Assets tend to appreciate over time, unlike Personal Use Assets, which tend to
depreciate, or at best keep pace with inflation, after you account for the expense
of ownership and maintenance.
 Make sure to maintain a Cash Reserve balance of three to six months required
living expenses (see Chapter 3).
 Total housing expenses, including mortgage debt, shouldn’t exceed more than 28
percent of total income.
 Total debt, including your mortgage, shouldn’t exceed more than 36 percent of
total income.
 Minimize your use of all debt, with the possible exceptions of home mortgage,
business, investments, and school loans. Used wisely, this type of debt can lever-
age your ability to acquire a home, start or expand a business, or advance your
education — and thereby enhance your ability to earn more money. (Refer to
Chapter 5 for more information.)
Keeping an Eye on Your Credit
Establishing and maintaining good credit takes time, but it is definitely worth the effort
you put into it. Your credit is used to determine the interest rate you will pay on a
home mortgage, a car loan, your auto insurance premiums, and possibly even affects
employment. Having a credit score of 750 or above can save you tens of thousands of
dollars in interest costs versus someone with a credit score of 650.

You can find a plethora of services available today touting that they will monitor your
credit report and score for you. Many also provide some degree of identity theft pro-
tection. However, monitoring your credit doesn’t eliminate the risk of identity theft; it
merely helps you learn about any fraudulent activity as soon as possible.
But be careful; many of these services cost $40 to $200 per year and often aren’t as
valuable as they first appear. 
Consider the following questions when comparing credit-monitoring services:
 Is the service checking with just one or all three of the major credit bureaus?
The three major credit bureaus are Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. You want
the service to check all three.
 How often is the information updated? The more frequent, the more valuable.
 How and how often will you be notified if something raises a “red flag”? You
should only use services that alert you of key changes to your file within 24
hours.
 What is the cost of the service? Typically, you should expect to pay $40 a year
for one bureau monitoring service to $200 a year for ongoing monitoring of all
three credit bureaus.
 Does the service provide identity theft insurance? If so, how does it work, and
how much does it cover? Be sure to ask potential services their policy on iden-
tity theft. (For more on this insurance, see Chapter 5.)
You can monitor your credit reports yourself and save a lot of money. You should
request a copy from each credit bureau at least once per year. I suggest that you ini-
tially get a copy of your report and have your spouse or partner also request their
reports immediately by calling (877) FACTACT or going online to www.AnnualCredit
Report.com.
On an ongoing basis, I recommend requesting a copy of your credit report directly
from Experian and then, about four months later, request your credit report from
TransUnion. Four months later, request your credit report from Equifax.
The contact information for the three major credit bureaus is as follows:
 Equifax: P.O. Box 740241, Atlanta, GA 30374; phone 800-685-1111; Web site
www.equifax.com.
 Experian: P.O. Box 2002, Allen, TX 75013; phone 888-322-5583; Web site
www.experian.com.
 TransUnion: P.O. Box 1000, Chester, PA 19022; phone 800-888-4213; Web site
www.transunion.com.
Although the information you find on each of these credit reports may differ quite a
bit, most information is duplicated. (For additional information on credit and debt,
refer to Chapter 5.)
If your credit score is below 750, here are the key factors to improving your credit:
 Make sure that the information on your credit report is accurate. Are there
accounts that don’t belong to you? Do balances appear even when an account has
been paid in full? If you find that information isn’t accurate, check out the section
“Disputing Inaccuracies on Your Credit Report,” later in this chapter.
25
Chapter 2: Getting Your Financial House in Order

 Pay your bills on time — every time. Send credit-card payments several days in
advance of the billing cycle cutoff date instead of the due date listed on your
statement.
 Keep your outstanding balances at 30 percent or less of your total credit line
per account. This approach is just one of the many ways that help raise your
credit score.
 Avoid opening new accounts. Transferring existing balances to a new lower rate
card lowers your interest expense (often only temporarily), but it also lowers
your credit score.
 Keep the old accounts open, even if you don’t use them. But watch out that no
one else is using them, either. The length of time you have maintained your
accounts is key.
Not only is it important for you to monitor your credit report, you need to monitor
your credit score. You can use Worksheet 2-5 to keep track of your credit score over
time.

Disputing Inaccuracies on Your Credit Report
Don’t be surprised to see things on your credit report that you don’t recognize. At
times, you may see legitimate debts that you have or once had. However, in about one
out of three times I check my credit report, I find inaccuracies. Fortunately, the Fair
Credit Reporting Act has made it easier to get errors corrected on your report in a
timely fashion.
Each of the credit bureaus offers an online method to dispute incorrect information on
your credit report. You may also call the credit bureau directly to report errors or dis-
pute inaccuracies (see the preceding section for the bureaus’ contact info). When you
request a copy of your credit report by phone or online, it comes with a form you can
and should use to dispute errors. After you’ve filled out and returned the form, the
credit bureaus are required by law to investigate your dispute and report back to you
within 30 days.
The credit bureau contacts the creditor to verify the accuracy of the information it
provided to the bureau. Many times, the error is acknowledged and quickly fixed; how-
ever, check your credit report again in one to three months to verify that the error has
been corrected. If it still appears, follow the same procedure until you get your prob-
lem resolved.
Keep notes of all your contacts, including the phone number you dialed, who you
spoke with, the date and time you called, the subject of the discussion, and any next
steps required. You can keep a log by using Worksheet 2-7. (You may want to make
copies of this worksheet instead of writing directly in this book so that you can store
the original in the appropriate file [see previous section for filing info] and make more
copies as needed.)

Chapter 3
Analyzing Your Cash Flow
In This Chapter
 Computing your spendable income
 Assessing what you need and what you want
 Figuring out how to overcome financial shortfalls
 Establishing a painless way to track your cash flow
B
udgeting is about as enjoyable as dieting, and neither works for most people. Budgets
and diets are all about deprivation, which isn’t a motivating concept. People may
become motivated to stick to their diet to improve their health or appearance. But few
people are motivated to follow a budget, mainly because it’s not directly tied to an immedi-
ate positive outcome.
In this chapter, you discover a more logical, simplistic, yet powerful way to think about your
income and expenses than you may have ever heard of before — all without a traditional
budget. After you have the clarity and empowerment to direct your resources to most effec-
tively accomplish your goals, you will have the motivation to stick to your cash flow spend-
ing plan (in other words, your budget).
Calculating Your Spendable Income
So you make $20,000, $40,000, or even $120,000 per year. However, don’t be lured in to the
common misunderstanding that you have $20,000, $40,000, or $120,000 per year to spend any
way that you want. After you pay income, Social Security, and Medicare taxes on your gross
earnings, you’re likely down a third or more. Then you need to account for the costs related
to earning these wages, such as commuting, dry cleaning, meals out, and child care — just to
name a few. You may also take a vacation periodically or treat yourself to regular massage
therapy to “decompress” from the stresses of your job.
What you have left after you take out all your must-pays — think taxes — is your net income.
I like to call the amount that remains after you deduct your job-related expenses your net, net
income or spendable income. To figure out your net income, gather together two to four (if
paid weekly) copies of recent paycheck stubs and complete Worksheet 3-2 with the informa-
tion taken directly from your paycheck stubs.

Some deductions occur monthly rather than per pay period, so two to four consecu-
tive paychecks should reveal all deductions. For example, if you receive two pay-
checks per month and your medical insurance deduction only occurs with the first
paycheck of each month, divide this amount by two when completing the worksheet.
In Worksheet 3-1, I also provide you with an example, which illustrates that an individ-
ual who earns $52,000 per year ($26 per hour) may actually have less than $7 per hour
remaining to spend on the daily necessities of life. This remainder is the number you
need to focus on.
Another important conclusion illustrated in this exercise is the fact that only $1,138
per month ($13,666 divided by 12) is available to cover all the expenditures not shown
elsewhere on Worksheet 3-1. This $1,138 per month is all that remains after the wage
earner has paid income and Social Security taxes, taken into account automatic deduc-
tions from his paycheck, and adjusted for job-related costs. Refer to Worksheet 3-3 for
a listing of the potential required monthly expenses that must be covered with this net
income.
Fortunately, in this example, the individual is also investing 10 percent of his gross
income into his retirement plan. He is also saving taxes by taking advantage of his
Flexible Spending Account and depositing the maximum allowable amount for child
care. Because of this, he also pays less in income taxes than the ordinary person
would.
Next time you consider making a purchase and you tell yourself, “Ah, it’s only 20
bucks,” calculate how long it will take to net $20 — for the person in this example, it
takes nearly three hours of work. Stop and ask yourself whether the purchase is worth
three hours of your work life and energy.

Figuring Out Where to Spend Your Money
After you determine your actual spendable income (see preceding section), you can
focus on how that remaining money needs to be spent. I like to segregate expenses
into three categories: needs, wants, and luxury items. But how do you distinguish
between the three?
Imagine that you’re a participant in the reality TV show Survivor. To survive in the
game, what must you have? Fire for warmth, purified water, and cooked food; water
and something to boil it in; and food and shelter — albeit crude. These items you must
have for basic survival are needs!
On the other hand, what would you like to have if you were on Survivor — things that
aren’t required to survive, but that would definitely make life more comfortable?
Possibly, you may wish you had a machete, a flint, a tarp, and fishing equipment. These
items aren’t required to survive, but they sure make survival more comfortable — a
perfect example of wants!
The reward challenge winners on Survivor receive luxury items, such as a hammock,
blankets, steak dinners, sodas, or a cruise to a posh resort with hot showers, massage,
and a five-course meal. These items that go beyond basic needs or even wants —
those cushy extras — are luxuries!
Now, taking a lesson from this reality TV show — what do you really need to spend
your money on in life? And what do you do if you have some extra money each month
after your needs are met? This section answers your questions and helps you figure
out what you need and what you want. And because you will likely use up all your
resources before you get through all your wants, just put the luxury category out of
mind for now.
Adding up your required expenses
Your required expenses, or needs, must come first. To figure out what your required
expenses (needs) are, you can begin to fill out Worksheet 3-3 by entering the total
amount you’re personally responsible for, or the total for the household, whichever 
is easier. (Sorry, no enhanced phone services, cell phones, cable TV, or high-speed
Internet, unless required for employment, are included in needs.)

$_______________
So where do you go after figuring out what you’re spending on needs? If you have a
surplus after meeting your required living expenses, go ahead and check out the sec-
tion on using your excess money for wants. However, if your income comes up short
(negative or close) after figuring out your needs, go ahead and skip to the section
“Solving for Shortfalls,” later in this chapter.
If you aren’t already doing so, I strongly encourage you to set up automatic monthly
withdrawals from your paycheck or your checking account to automatically pay for or
fund each of the required expenditures from Worksheet 3-3. That way, your require-
ments are met automatically each and every month, and whatever is left over is yours
to spend however you see fit.
Wading through your wants
Hopefully, you find yourself with some “extra” money after determining and paying for
your needs (see preceding section), and you can begin to use some of that money for
the items or services you want. You can use Worksheet 3-4 to figure out your wants
and how much you’d like to be spending on them.
When determining what to do with your surplus, just remember that magic number
(the amount of surplus from Worksheet 3-3) and don’t exceed that amount when
addressing your wants.

After you add all your needs from Worksheet 3-3 together with the list of wants from

you determine that you have negative cash flow, you should revisit Worksheet 3-4 and
prioritize your expenditures so that you don’t plan to spend more than you bring in.
41
Chapter 3: Analyzing Your Cash Flow

Solving for Shortfalls
If you have a shortfall after you calculate your required expenses (see Worksheet 3-3),
something has got to give. Worksheet 3-3 should include only those items that are
truly required. Yes, you really do have to pay taxes and your mortgage or rent and buy
groceries, but you may need to re-evaluate the amount of money you’re paying for
these needs. Consider the following suggestions when you’re faced with a shortfall:
 Don’t completely cut out any of your required expenditures. You may be
tempted to consider dropping insurance coverages and/or saving the amount of
money you need to be saving for a “rainy day” if you don’t have surplus cash
flow or don’t have as much as you might like. You aren’t doing yourself any
favors by skipping these items, and the decision will come back to haunt you
sooner or later. Get used to thinking of these items as required expenditures;
they really are necessities. Maybe not this month or even this year, but eventu-
ally you will be confronted head on with these expenses. Be prepared. (For more
on insurance, see Part V.)
 Review each of the needs categories and consider ways to cut down on neces-
sary expenses. For example, you may be able to obtain less expensive insurance
and save money on groceries, clothing, and transportation by shopping around.
 Consider your employment. Often times, the only reasonable option you, your
spouse, or partner may have is to increase your income by working overtime 
(if that is an option), taking on a part-time job, or possibly even changing jobs.
Tracking Expenses: Figuring Out 
Where Your Cash Is Going
Tracking your expenses is especially useful when your outgoing cash flow exceeds
your income. Fortunately, you don’t need to go back and tally up months’ worth of
checking account registers, credit- and debit-card statements, and cash withdrawals.
I find that this is a very time-consuming and painful exercise. Just estimate!
Consider using Worksheet 3-5 to help you monitor your spending for the next couple
of months. As you pay your bills, complete the worksheet.

Chapter 3: Analyzing Your Cash Flow

If you’re looking for a simpler method of tracking your expenses, you can use
Worksheet 3-6 to track every cent of your surplus money that you have to spend.
Begin with the total surplus shown at the bottom of worksheet 3-4.
Write down every occasion you spend your surplus money, whether you purchase a
soda at work, buy gasoline on the way home, or go to the movies. Account for every
cent. Also, track whether you paid by cash, check, or debit or credit card; who you
paid; and whether the expenditure falls into the need or want category.
Use one log for each pay period. Note at the top of the worksheet how much your
beginning surplus is (if you complete Worksheet 3-4, you can find this amount at the
bottom of that worksheet) and subtract from that amount each expenditure.

Chapter 4
Changing Your Dreams into Goals
In This Chapter
 Daring to dream
 Transferring dreams into goals
 Prioritizing your goals
S
ometime throughout your life, you may have had someone encourage you to “dream
big” or “reach for the stars.” But have you ever taken the time to really examine what
your dreams are and how you can actually turn your aspirations into goals? Well, now is
your chance to do more than just daydream about that island vacation or your child’s col-
lege fund. The time has come to turn your dreams into realities.
It has been said that a goal is just a dream with a deadline. This chapter is designed to help
you convert the dreams that matter most to you into measurable goals. After you can meas-
ure it, you can manage it, and you will achieve it.
In this chapter, I don’t differentiate between personal goals and financial goals, because
they’re interrelated. Some of your dreams and goals may not cost any money. However, if
they don’t, they at least take time and energy. Your time and energy are likely the most valu-
able resources you have, and they can produce money; however, money can’t easily produce
time and energy.
Financial planning involves channeling your resources — all of them — to best accomplish
what matters most in your life. You not only need to consider your financial assets and liabili-
ties, but your personal assets and liabilities, dreams, goals, and fears as well. Financial instru-
ments (investments, insurance, retirement plans, savings strategies, and so on) are just tools
that you’ll utilize along your financial journey through life, and you’ll get to them later in this
book. However, first things first: What matters most in your life?
Delving into Your Dreams
No matter what you want to call it — brainstorming or brain dumping — it is time to dream
big without holding back and to get those dreams written in stone. (Well, I guess paper will
have to do for now.) Think of all the things you want to do and see or who you want to
become. Then, using Worksheet 4-2, list the dreams that are most important to you at this
time. You can use Worksheet 4-1 as an example if you need help getting started or if you get
stuck in the middle.

The following instructions walk you through how to use Worksheet 4-2:
1. In the What column of Worksheet 4-2, quickly list the first 30 goals that come
to mind when responding to the question, “What 30 things would you most
like to see, do, accomplish, and experience in your life?”
Dig really deep and list 30 goals — no more, no less. The first five or ten may
come to you easily. However, if you get stuck, consider all the possibilities,
including:
• What do you want to do? (activities, hobbies, routines, interests)
• What or who do you want to see? (travel, cultural events, family, friends)
• Who do you want to be? (personal development, career, volunteerism,
community involvement, philanthropy)
• What experiences do you want to have? (vacation with spouse, continue
your education, make a charitable donation to your favorite cause, provide
a legacy for your children)
2. Review your list of goals and rank each by their priority. Indicate in the left
column how important achieving each item is to you by selecting from the fol-
lowing Priority list:
A = Must achieve (no choice)
B = Would love to achieve (but will live if you don’t)
C = Would really be nice to achieve, but not at the cost of A or B goals
3. Indicate in the When column approximately when you want to, or when you
must, achieve each of your stated goals.
Be as specific as possible. If an actual date or deadline is involved, use that date.
If you have no deadline, provide yourself with as much guidance as possible.
4. In the What’s Required column, try to list the resources you need in order to
accomplish the stated goal.
Do you need time, energy, labor, money, or help? Be as specific as possible. Say,
for example, that you want to remodel your kitchen this year. You may need to
do some research and gather specific details regarding what exactly will be
involved in your remodeling project.
• How much of the work can you complete yourself compared to how much
of the work licensed professionals must perform?
• Do you have friends or family members who are willing, able, and available
to assist you?
• How much time and energy do you anticipate needing to invest personally?
• How much will purchasing the materials and supplies cost?
• How much will the licensed professionals cost?
• Will you need to finance any or all of these costs?
• What are your financing options?
50
Part I: Getting on the Road to Financial Fitness 

5. In the What Are You Willing to Do column, write what you are willing to do to
achieve this goal.
The achievement of goals often involves much more than just money. Some goals
may be so important to you that you are willing to forego or postpone many of
your other dreams to ensure that your most important goals are achieved. You
must make the call.
To help you determine how you plan to allocate your time, energy, and money to
accomplish your goals, ask yourself the following questions:
• What are you willing to sacrifice to achieve specific goals?
• Is achieving a certain goal so important to you that you are willing and able
to earn more money if that is what is needed?
• Is the desired timeframe for achieving this goal something that you can
adjust?
• Are you willing and able to sell something to raise the money needed to
achieve the goal?
• Are you willing and able to do more of the work yourself to reduce your
out-of-pocket costs?
• Are you willing and able to dedicate the time and energy necessary to
achieve this goal?
• Do your spouse/partner and family support your efforts for the goals in
which they are involved?
6. For now, leave the Revised Priority ranking field blank; you can fill it in after
going through the exercises in the section “Determining Your Most Important
Goals,” later in this chapter.

Chapter 4: Changing Your Dreams into Goals

Have your spouse or partner complete this exercise in Worksheet 4-2, too. It’s amazing
just how much you can discover about yourself and your significant other when you
really dig deep regarding your financial life goals. Plus, you want to make sure that
you’re both fully aware of each other’s priorities. It’s unlikely that you’ll come up with
most of the same goals. That’s okay. You’re an individual, and you may also be part of
a couple. You’ll have individual goals, and you’ll also have goals you want to achieve
with your spouse. And your goals will be different — frequently. There is nothing
wrong with differences. The only thing that can go wrong is not exploring what matters
most to you and sharing that with your spouse.
Determining Which Dreams Matter Most
So you may know what your dreams are, but do you know which ones are most impor-
tant to you? How can you know which ones to focus on as you begin to shape your
goals? (See the section “Developing an Action Plan” for more on establishing goals.) In
this section, I’d like you to approach the same subject — what you want or dream of —
from a markedly different perspective. Instead of a brainstorm of 30 goals that come to
mind, look at your dreams as the things that matter most to you.
After reading George Kinder’s book, The Seven Stages of Money Maturity (Dell), and par-
ticipating in a workshop of the same name, I walked away with three very remarkable
questions, which you can find in Worksheets 4-3 through 4-5. These questions can help
you discover what truly matters most to you, so you can know which dreams to focus
on and make into goals. (See the next section on this topic.)
Work through the questions in Worksheets 4-3, 4-4, and 4-5 and record your responses
in the space provided. (If you haven’t created your wish list, you may find it easier to
do Worksheet 4-2 first.) Be sure to invest thoughtful time and energy as you ponder the
questions. If you really devote yourself to this task, you may begin to develop a realiza-
tion and level of clarity about your dreams that you may not have had before. You may
discover that some things no longer have the importance they once had, while other
ambitions have now become most important in your life.
After you finish answering the questions in Worksheets 4-3 through 4-5, go back to
Worksheet 4-2 and revisit the Priority Rankings column with the three questions in
mind. You may want to revise your priority ranking at this stage. Use the Revised
Priority field on the right-hand side of Worksheet 4-2 to record any changes.
You can also have your spouse or partner answer these questions on his or her own,
and then compare notes. What you discover may raise your level of commitment and
motivation to certain dreams tremendously, and you’re more likely to pursue and
achieve the dreams to which you’re most committed.
Worksheet 4-3
Reframing Your Priorities Question #1
I want you to imagine that you are financially secure, that you have enough money to
take care of your needs, now and in the future.  The question is . . . how would you live
your life? Would you change anything?  Let yourself go.  Don’t hold back on your
dreams.
Describe a life that is complete, that is richly yours.

This time you visit your doctor who tells you that you have only 5 to 10 years left to

no notice of the moment of your death.  What will you do in the time you have remain-
ing to live?
Will you change your life, and how will you do it?

Developing an Action Plan
After you’ve figured out your wish list and have prioritized what matters most (see
previous sections), you can then put structure to and create an action plan for these
dreams to become goals. And with that action plan, your dreams can become realities.
Each goal must be a top priority, something you have the desire and capacity to
achieve, and be measurable. First, use Worksheet 4-6 to identify your primary goals
based on their level of importance. Then, in Worksheet 4-8, sort them by time period
and action items involved. (See Worksheet 4-7 for an example.)

Worksheet 4-7
Action Plan (Example)
Which, if any, of your goals could you meet right now?
#1
What: Getting my estate plan updated.
Why: To protect my family and make things as easy as possible upon my death.
When: As soon as possible. Okay, okay, I’ll call the estate planning attorney tomorrow
morning and make an appointment.
How: Hire the estate planning attorney. Provide him with my basic financial record and
pay the bill.
#2
What: Pay down my home equity line of credit.
Why: I have extra money in my checking account. I could apply that money to my home
equity line of credit and save myself over 5 percent per year in interest costs.
When: Now.
How: Write a check from the checking account with the excess cash reserves to my mortgage
company. Mail check along with payment voucher to the mortgage company.
Which, if any, of your objectives could you achieve within the next 12 months?
#1
What: Tile the hallway.
Why: Because the current flooring is gross and outdated, and I’ve already purchased the tile.
When: During the second half of July. I don’t really have the spare time or energy until then.
How: I’ll need to rent a wet saw and buy some supplies. The total cost of these items should
be under $200. I will also need to finagle assistance from one or two friends for the two-day
project. I’ve got a couple of friends in mind. I’ll need to return a similar favor to them someday.
Which, if any, of your objectives could you achieve within the next five years?
#1
What: Converting the workshop into a guest house.
Why: Have separate living quarters for long-term guests, possibly my parents in their later
years, and to enhance the value of our home.
When: We don’t have a looming deadline for this goal. However, we really appreciate extended
visits from friends and family members. Without having a separate living area, we and our
guests may grow tired of too much time together. Given these feelings and the costs involved
with renovating the space, I want to begin construction within five years.
How: We can and want to do a lot of the remodeling work ourselves. However, we will need to
hire professionals to plumb and wire the kitchen and bath. We want to have the option to hire
a carpenter to do the rough-in of the walls and ceiling as well.
We have made a list of all the things that need to happen and obtained best guess estimates
on the total cost of the project. We expect to spend up to $20,000 renovating this space,
but don’t currently have any money set aside for this goal. We don’t want to borrow it either.
Therefore, over the next 60 months, we will save $300 per month in a money market account
earmarked for this goal.

and your family members can gain skills that they won’t
learn anywhere else.  
And when it comes to getting the most out of your money,
taxes can’t be ignored — no matter how much you may
like to try.  Understanding how to minimize your tax liabili-
ties can help you get even more out of the money you
bring in, which is why I also cover taxes in this part.

D
ebt has skyrocketed over the last few years, although most incomes have remained
fairly consistent. Part of this increase is due to the refinancing of home mortgages and
the growth in home equity loan balances as a direct result of the housing boom, which took
place in many parts of the United States over the last few years. To make matters worse,
mortgage companies have been issuing home loans well in excess of healthy guidelines, and
the result has been an unprecedented number of foreclosures and bankruptcy filings.
And unfortunately, consumer debt — credit cards, auto loans, and personal loans — has also
skyrocketed. In fact, consumer debt, including credit cards and auto and personal loans, has
more than doubled from 1990 to 2000, and the trend continues. Part of the reason may be
because credit-card issuers are the most aggressive and predatory lenders — next to payday
loan companies. Since 1990, personal credit-card debt alone has tripled. The slogan seems to
be: Easy credit for everyone! Come and get it! Trade your financial freedom for instant gratifi-
cation! But don’t think for one minute that the credit issuers are here to do you any favors.
This is their business, and they make a lot of money off you.
Knowing when and how to use credit can be tricky business. And if you find yourself deep 
in debt, you may feel strangled by the pressure of paying it off. In order for you to have the
upper hand when it comes to your credit, you need to figure out how much debt you can
really afford to have, how much debt you already have, and how to get rid of unhealthy debt
for good. I provide hands-on tools for you to do just that in this chapter. (For info on figuring
out your credit score, check out Chapter 2.)
Determining How Much Debt You Can Afford
No one is going to look out for your backside except you — especially when it comes to your
credit. Just because a mortgage company or a credit-card issuer will give you money doesn’t
mean you should take it. According to your lender, you may qualify for more debt than you
know you can afford in your current situation or for your long-term financial plans. And the
guidelines that many companies use to determine whether you’re in a good position (or
financially “healthy” enough) to increase your indebtedness aren’t always in your best 
interest.

Before you take on more debt, you need to determine the amount of money you can
afford to borrow while still having money available to do other important things in
your life — now and in the future.
When calculating your allowable amount of debt, you need to know two terms: front-
end ratio and back-end ratio. Your front-end ratio is your total monthly housing cost
divided by your gross monthly income. The back-end ratio, on the other hand, is the
total of all of your debts and your housing costs divided by your gross monthly
income. When adding up these expenses and debt, your front-end ratio should never
exceed 28 percent, and your back-end ratio needs to stay at or below 36 percent.
For example, check out Worksheet 5-1. In this worksheet, you can see that the bor-
rower passed the front-end ratio, but failed the back-end ratio. The combination of
housing costs and other debts eat up 40 percent of this borrower’s gross income.
Worksheet 5-1
Maximum Debt Ratios (Example)
Another 25 to 30 percent goes to income taxes and Social Security taxes, leaving this
borrower with only about 30 to 35 percent of his gross income ($1,750) to spend on
everything else he needs now and in the future — at least until those other debts are
paid off. This borrower must cover all other expenses, both required and discre-
tionary, with only $1,750 per month.
If he’s single, the problem isn’t nearly as grim; however, if the borrower in Worksheet 5-1
is young and hasn’t saved much or anything towards retirement, he should be saving

at least $500 per month for this goal. If he’s older and hasn’t saved much or anything
toward retirement, the amount he needs to save each month goes up dramatically. See
Chapter 11 for more information on saving for retirement.
For now, go ahead and presume that the borrower is young and begins saving 10 per-
cent of his gross income for retirement. Now he’s down to $1,250 per month, and that
amount has to cover all insurance premiums (other than homeowners), all utilities, gro-
ceries, household and personal supplies, gasoline, auto maintenance, child care, dental
care, gifts, dining out and entertainment, vacations, home repairs, and so on.
Bottom line: If you breach the front-end or back-end ratio, you’ll find yourself strug-
gling to make ends meet, let alone achieving any other financial objectives you may
have. If you find that you’re already breaching one or both of these ratios (like the bor-
rower in Worksheet 5-1), you need to start getting rid of some debt (figure out how in
the section “Developing a Plan of Attack to Wipe Out Debt” later in this chapter).
To figure out where you stand with your current debt, go ahead and complete
Worksheet 5-2.

Chapter 5: Using Credit Wisely

Reviewing Your Monthly Statements 
with a Critical Eye
Look over each and every one of your credit-card statements each month. You may
be surprised to find charges on your account that aren’t yours, or you may not have
realized just how much you’re charging each month. Worksheet 5-3 provides a check-
list of items you need to look for on your statements as well as why these items are
important.
If you see anything you’re unsure about or that’s incorrect on any part of your credit-
card statement, call the credit-card company immediately and resolve the issue.
Worksheet 5-3
Credit-Card Statement Review Checklist
❏All charges are mine and correct. If you see charges that you aren’t certain
about, contact your credit-card company immediately. It should provide you
with as much clarification as it has about the charge, and presuming you still
don’t recognize it, the company will begin an investigation with the merchant in
question.
❏All payments I made during the reporting period have been posted correctly
and timely to my account. Credit-card companies often take seven to ten days
or more to receive and process a payment that you made. Keep track of when
you mail a payment or authorize a telephone or online payment. Having a credit-
card company conveniently post payments one day past the due date and
charge a late-payment fee isn’t unheard of, so keep an eye out on that too.
❏No fees were charged during this billing cycle. If you were charged a fee,
review all fees charged. Do they appear correct? Other than the potential annual
fee, you should have no other fees such as late fees, over-limit fees, or returned-
payment fees.
❏The interest rate hasn’t changed since my last statement. If your interest rate
has changed, find out why by calling the credit-card company. Interest rates can
go up upon the expiration of some special short-term, extra low interest rate,
also known as the teaser rate, period or sooner, if you fail to make payments by
the due date and/or if you exceed your credit line at any time.
❏I have verified the payment due date. This deadline is the “drop-dead” date for
payments to be received. Many credit-card companies have the right to substan-
tially increase your interest rate and assess a late-payment fee if you miss this
deadline.
❏I have made note of the statement closing date. Sending your payment in on
time to be credited before the statement closing date can help your credit score.
Getting Rid of Solicitations
You may feel bombarded and worn down by lenders soliciting your business. Also, by
limiting or eliminating credit-card and loan offers, you will be less apt to apply for this
“easy” credit.
74
Part II: Getting the Most Out of Your Money 

One way to minimize the number of solicitations you receive from would-be lenders is
to get your name added to no-call or no-solicitation lists, which you can do by follow-
ing the checklist in Worksheet 5-4. Eliminating these solicitations also reduces the
number of opportunities identity thieves have to establish credit in your name — and
saves a few trees.
Registering your name with no-call or no-solicit lists doesn’t in any way affect your
ability to borrow money.
Worksheet 5-4
Do Not Call or Solicit
❏Call 888-5OP-TOUT (888-567-8688) to have your name removed from the market-
ing lists that are sold by credit bureaus to potential lenders.
❏Write the Direct Marketing Association to be removed from its direct mail and
phone lists. Be sure to write a letter to each of the following:
• Mail Preference Service, P.O. Box 643, Carmel, NY 10512
• Telephone Preference Service, P.O. Box 1559, Carmel, NY 10512
You can also contact the Direct Marketing Association online and request
that your information be removed from their mail, telephone, and e-mail
marketing databases:
www.dmaconsumers.org/cgi/offmailing
www.dmaconsumers.org/cgi/offphone
www.dmaconsumers.org/cgi/offemaillist.html
❏Register for the National Do Not Call list at www.donotcall.gov or by calling
888-382-1222.
Unfortunately, you can’t eliminate all unwanted solicitations by getting your names on
these lists. Charities, politicians, survey-takers, and companies that you currently do
business with are exempt from these rules. However, you can still ask companies indi-
vidually to add your name to their internal do-not-call lists.
Assessing Your Current Debt Situation
The first step in assessing your current debt situation is to list all mortgage and 
consumer debt, including credit cards, auto loans, student loans, and any other per-
sonal debt.
To begin your assessment, you want to get all your debt listed in the same place so that
you can see it all at once. (Okay, you may need to take a deep breath first.) You can use
Worksheet 5-5 to list your current debt situation. If you have a copy of your current
combined credit report in hand, Worksheet 5-5 is easy to complete. If you don’t, you’ll
need to pull copies of all your credit-card and loan statements to obtain this informa-
tion. You should get a copy of your credit report each year. It’s easy. If you haven’t
obtained one this year, you can get a free copy at www.annualcreditreport.com.
75
Chapter 5: Using Credit Wisely

Worksheet 5-5
Current Debt Situation
Add up the total of your required monthly debt service payments and divide that
amount by your monthly gross income. The result is your back-end ratio.
TOTAL = CURRENT BALANCE 
TOTAL = MONTHLY PAYMENTS
Back-End Ratio = total of monthly payments divided by monthly gross income = _____%
Back-end ratio should be no more than 36%.
After you’ve completed Worksheet 5-5, figure out which debts are consumer debts. One
by one, I want you to review each of your consumer debts in detail and then complete
Worksheet 5-6.
You can obtain some of the info you need to complete this worksheet from your credit
report (if you have it handy); however, most of what you need is available only on your
monthly account statement. Also, here are a few additional guidelines you need to

Part II: Getting the Most Out of Your Money 

 To figure out the ratio of balance to available credit of an account, divide the cur-
rent balance by the credit line. (For high credit scores, the ratio shouldn’t
exceed 30 percent.)
 If you currently have a teaser rate, expect that at some point in the near future
the current interest rate will be adjusted drastically higher.
 When determining the term of your loan, you want to check whether you have a
fixed or variable rate, a balloon payment, or loans amortized over a period of
time (30 years, 5 years, and so on). Refer to Chapter 9 for explanations of this
terminology.

Developing a Plan of Attack 
to Wipe Out Debt
Are you losing sleep because of the amount of debt you’re carrying? Are you wasting
money on finance charges and feel like you will never get ahead? With an aggressive
debt-reduction plan and your persistence, you can wipe out that debt — sooner than
you might imagine.
A great, free tool that can help you quickly establish the most effective debt reduction
plan for your unique situation is available online at www.quicken.com/planning/debt.
The tool enables you to input all your current debts or just your consumer debt, if that
is what’s most troubling to you. You enter the current balances, interest rates, mini-
mum monthly payments, and the actual monthly payments that you have been
making. With this information, the online calculator tool reallocates your payments to
help you first meet all minimum requirements and then applies any excess cash flow
toward your highest interest rate cards so that these debts get paid off first, saving
you substantial interest over time.
However, you don’t need a computer or Internet access to develop and follow a debt-
reduction plan. You can accomplish the same outcome by following the steps below,
which takes focus and persistence, but no complicated math. For this exercise, focus
only on your credit-card debt. Use Worksheet 5-7 to complete the following steps:
1. List all your credit-card debtors in order of highest interest rate first.
2. List the current balances on each of these accounts.
3. List the minimum required monthly payment for each account.
4. Total the minimum required monthly payments.
5. Enter the total amount you have available each month (after paying your
required expenses — see Chapter 3) to apply toward your debt-reduction
plan.
Generally, it’s wise to apply only the required minimum payment to each credit
card other than the one with the highest interest rate. However, you need to con-
sider other factors as well. One of the most important factors is how the amount
of debt on a card compares to the available credit on that card. A high debt bal-
ance to available credit ratio really hurts your credit score. Focus on maintaining
80
Part II: Getting the Most Out of Your Money 

no more than a 30 percent balance to available credit on any card. Pay down the
high interest credit cards most aggressively and focus on reducing debt ratios if
the interest rates are fairly similar.
6. Record actual payments made and date of payment in the far right-hand
column of Worksheet 5-7.

 Unearthing how you think and feel about spending money
 Determining whether you spend too much
 Discovering spending strategies to help you stay on course
 Exploring ways to reduce spending without cramping your style
T
he average American is bombarded with thousands of advertisements every day. Trying
to shelter yourself from those who want to part you from your money is nearly impossi-
ble. Between television, radio, billboards, Internet ads, junk mail, magazines, and the list
goes on and on, you would have to become a hermit to avoid these solicitations — but that
sounds a bit extreme.
No matter how much money you spend, you most likely won’t look like a supermodel or per-
form like a world-class athlete simply by wearing the same clothes and makeup or buying the
newest, most prestigious golf clubs or running shoes.
So, how do you block out these very motivating messages of Madison Avenue and stand
strong against the onslaught? Well, I admit that not giving in to the spending frenzy isn’t easy,
but it can be done with a bit of self-discipline and perspective on what you really need. In
other words, spending thoughtfully.
This chapter brings to light many tips and strategies that can help you make more thoughtful
spending discussions on a regular basis. Only you can protect your financial future from the
ever-present instant-gratification temptation.
Gauging How You Really Feel 
About Spending Money
To get onto the path of conscientious spending, it’s helpful to step back and explore your
current relationship with money: How does spending money make you feel? Why do you
make the spending decisions that you do? Developing a better understanding of how your
mind works when it comes to the subject of money can help you overcome challenges that
you may face in saving and spending wisely.

Behavioral finance is a relatively new field of science that explores how people make
decisions about money. One of the key principles is the concept of mental accounting,
which is a game your mind plays on you.
I’ve provided you with Worksheet 6-1 to use to think through each scenario outlined
and notate how you anticipate you would feel about each situation if it were to happen
to you. If you feel that the money was a windfall, or in essence “found” money, check
that box. Or if you feel that the money was “earned,” something you deserved (similar
to wages), check that box. Then indicate whether you would be more inclined to
spend the money or save it based on how it came to you.
Worksheet 6-1
Mental Accounting Quiz
Reflect for a moment on your responses. Did you find yourself feeling more free or enti-
tled to spend a windfall versus items that you considered earned? Because each of
these scenarios illustrated a situation that may have been entirely unexpected, did you
feel less guilty about spending the money? Did guilt even cross your mind? Did you
view this newfound money as an opportunity to spend or save, or possibly both,
depending on your own mental accounting? Think for a moment about these questions
and then write your responses down in Worksheet 6-2.
Worksheet 6-2
My Reflections

Windfall or Earned

1) You receive an unexpected refund on your
income tax return of $2,000.
2) You receive an inheritance from your old,
miserly Uncle Scrooge.
3) You cash in your company stock options
for a nice profit.
4) Your employer gives you a profit sharing
contribution or match on your retirement
savings amount.
5) Your spouse or partner receives a
ìsigning bonus” upon changing jobs.
6) You visit the casino and walk out with ten
times more money than you started with.
7) One of your investment returns triples
in value in just three years.

Do you feel more entitled to, or less guilty, spending money that comes to you as a
windfall, compared to money that you earn? A dollar is a dollar. It shouldn’t make a dif-
ference how the money came to you.
Your mind plays tricks on you — in Behavioral Finance, they call it mental accounting.
You spend money less carefully when you feel you have received a windfall than if you
earn it.
Remember: Focus on the fact that you have more money with which to accomplish 
the goals most important in your life. Don’t waste a windfall. Use those dollars just as
thoughtfully and appropriately as you would dollars that came in your paycheck.
Another fundamental principal of behavioral finance illustrates that people are natu-
rally loss averse. In other words, they feel more pain from losing money than they feel
pleasure in gaining the same amount of money. This aversion to losses helps explain
why some people continue to hold on to a bad investment, because after they sell it,
the loss becomes real to them. You may also see other symptoms of loss aversion in
overly conservative investment portfolios.
Being averse to loss is a very normal and healthy human emotion. However, the most
successful money managers are able to minimize their emotional urges and make
rational decisions with regard to their money.
Figuring Out Whether You Overspend
Have you ever purchased things that you later regretted? Have you acquired “stuff”
and now don’t know why? Did you ever take yourself shopping or treat yourself to
something that may have been impractical or inappropriate for you at the time?
Well, I have — plenty of times. But I’m not proud of it. Unhealthy spending can be com-
pared to unhealthy eating. Money is something that touches most aspects of your life.
You can’t avoid money — just like you can’t avoid food. Making bad decisions about
your food intake can ruin your physical health, just as making poor money decisions
can devastate your fiscal health. Fortunately, the human body has the ability to with-
stand a lot more abuse than your bank account or credit report. Maintaining good
fiscal health takes an ongoing investment of energy, time, and persistence.
You probably don’t like to think that you may be wasting your personal or family
resources, and neither do I. However, remember that everyone is human and suscepti-
ble to making spending decisions based on irrational emotions rather than logical and
practical facts — but that doesn’t mean you have no influence or control over your
urges to lay down your hard-earned cash.
85
Chapter 6: Spending Thoughtfully

Awareness and acknowledgment are the first steps to improvement. I’ve worked on
becoming conscious of my own tendency to spend money without thinking and can
now make better decisions with that awareness. And most likely, if you knew you were
making reckless, thoughtless decisions that could negatively impact your future, you
wouldn’t do it either.
So take a minute to ask yourself: Do you overspend? Maybe the answer is a resounding
“Yes!” Or maybe you feel that you don’t overspend — or at least don’t do it regularly.
Care to find out? To figure out whether you’re overspending, take the quiz in
Worksheet 6-3. Circle Yes or No in response to each question.

Part II: Getting the Most Out of Your Money 

Reflect on your responses to the questions in Worksheet 6-3. If you answered Yes to
questions 1 and 2, you’re probably doing really well. I find that with desire and dedica-
tion, we all can improve if need be.
However, if you answered Yes to questions 3, 4, and 5, you or someone in your house-
hold has spent a lot more than necessary, and this excess spending may be a chronic
problem, which is keeping you from achieving your financial goals.
Regarding the final question, if your spouse or friends jokingly tell people that you
have forwarded your mail to your favorite store, you may be an overspender! If they
debate about two or more choices, you may be an overspender! (I’m hearing Jeff
Foxworthy’s voice.) However, if you and your spouse or friends can’t quite figure out
which store type would be your favorite, maybe you’re not a shopaholic at all.
Note: Personally, I have a major weakness in bookstores — imagine that. With this
awareness, I can moderate or completely eliminate my spending in this category. If I
don’t enter a bookstore or go online shopping, I can’t overspend — at least in this
area.
It can be difficult to change spending habits you may have had for years — although
you may be aware that these habits cost you money or are irrational, unhealthy behav-
iors. But changing old habits takes time and persistence. It took a long time to get
where you are now with your spending, and it is reasonable (and I argue healthy) to
recognize that adapting behaviors to become a much healthier consumer does take
time, so don’t get discouraged if you discover that you are, in fact, overspending.
One of your greatest assets — if not The greatest asset you have — is your ability to
earn money. Unfortunately, if you are anything like most people, your biggest liability
is your penchant for spending it. Use this critical asset thoughtfully. Thoughtful, con-
scientious, deliberate spending actually reduces total outflow, while adding to your
quality of life.
You likely can’t afford to follow the herd, and it’s not wise to try to keep up with the
Joneses. In the modern classic, The Millionaire Next Door, the authors profiled dozens
of self-made millionaires. These millionaires had several common characteristics. In
my opinion, the most relevant characteristic or behavior trait they all shared is that
they were and continue to be thoughtful spenders. Another word for it is frugal. They
save a portion of every dollar they make. They make spending decisions very thought-
fully. Most don’t “look” like what you might think a millionaire looks like. In fact, if they
did “look” like a millionaire — fancy clothes, jewelry, cars, houses, and trips — they
wouldn’t have achieved their millionaire status.
Would you rather look like a millionaire or have the financial security of becoming
one? Most people can’t have both. Pick up a copy of Cosmopolitan for tips on looking
like a millionaire. Continue with this workbook for guidance on becoming a millionaire.
You can’t have your money working for you if you spend it all.
87
Chapter 6: Spending Thoughtfully

This concept is not living within your means, but rather living beneath your means.
Living within means that you can make ends meet. Living beneath means that you have
money remaining to save and invest for other things you need and want in your life.
Managing Your Spending
The American way is to spend everything you bring in. But just because most people
in the United States are doing it doesn’t mean that this way of managing your spending
is healthy or smart. The best way I have found to manage spending is to have money
automatically drawn from my checking account or paycheck to fund those things that
are necessities (utilities, insurance, house payments, retirement savings, and so on) or
are most important to me (to figure out your needs, check out Chapter 3). If I didn’t
put my savings on autopilot, it wouldn’t get done, at least not as easily and consis-
tently as it could be done. Consistency and simplicity are key when it comes to achiev-
ing financial success.
What do you currently have set up as an automatic payment or investment? For exam-
ple, do you have money withdrawn from your paycheck going into your flexible spend-
ing account or 401(k) plan at work? What else could you set up to occur automatically
out of your paycheck or checking account? Use Worksheet 6-4 to explore all the
expenses, loan payments, insurance premiums, and investments that you can set up to
occur automatically. By automating your payments and investments, your bills get
paid on time, every time, saving you hassle and potential late fees, and by investing
automatically, you don’t have a chance to spend the money before it gets put to work
for your other goals.

Developing Good Shopping Habits
Shopping can often feel like a black hole on your finances. Every time you step into a
grocery store or a shopping center, you may feel like you come out flat broke. In order
to not allow your shopping trips to turn into a spending frenzy, take time to think
about how you can spend more thoughtfully.
When shopping, always keep the following in mind: Reduce, reuse, and recycle. For
example, don’t buy overly processed, prepackaged foods. The more packaging and
processing involved, the more it will cost you. Reduce packaged and processed items.
Prepackaged groceries generally cost at least twice as much as whole foods, often mul-
tiple times more. For example, you can buy ready-to-heat twice-baked potatoes for
approximately $1 per serving, or you can buy the ingredients to make twice-baked
potatoes from scratch for less than 15¢ per serving. Make up a giant batch and freeze
the leftovers, and now you have your very own homemade, ready-to-heat, twice-baked
potatoes for a fraction of the cost.
Also try to buy whole foods, in their natural state, whenever possible: fresh fruit, veg-
etables, meat, and dairy products. If you’re limiting your fat intake, buy fresh eggs and
discard half, or even all, of the yokes (the fat is in the yoke). This approach costs you
about half as much as the reduced-fat egg substitute in a carton and is much fresher,
with no additives, preservatives, or food coloring.
You can reduce trash by minimizing your use of paper towels, disposable plates and
cups, and plastic shopping bags. Instead, reuse cloth towels and durable plates and
cups and take your shopping bags with you to the grocery store. Many stores credit
you 5¢ per bag for bringing your own. Not only are you saving money, but you’re also
saving landfills. Over the course of a year, simply reusing these items can save you
tens of dollars. Just think of how many other items this concept could apply to.
89
Chapter 6: Spending Thoughtfully

You can reduce the number of items that you purchase by sharing with, or renting
from, others. For example, say that you like to garden. A rototiller comes in handy
once or twice a year, so instead of buying a rototiller, consider borrowing one from a
neighbor or renting one.
The following are some other key ways to keep your shopping expenses at a minimum:
 Use a shopping list and purchase only the items on your list. By following this
guideline, you can begin to better plan your expenditures. And if you stick to
your list, you can eliminate those nasty impulse purchases. However, if you dis-
cover something that you truly do need while shopping and the item’s on sale for
a limited time, you may purchase that item, but recognize that it’s an impulse
purchase, not a thoughtful expenditure. You can use Worksheet 6-5 to begin your
own shopping list.
 Don’t go grocery shopping when you’re hungry. It’s common that people spend
more and buy more processed — and, therefore, more expensive — food when
they’re hungry.
 Buy dry goods in bulk. Often (but not always), the more you buy, the cheaper
the price.
 Buy merchandise when it is going out of season. Buy next year’s winter coat or
swimsuit when the prices are dirt cheap instead of at the beginning of the season
when it’s not on sale. And when you’re shopping for clothes, buy wash-and-wear
clothes rather than dry-clean only.
 Shop at discount stores. Deep-discount grocery stores, such as Aldi’s, can save
you a lot of money.
 Avoid brand names when a generic equivalent is available. Often times, the
generic form is made by brand-name companies and is of the same quality.
Buying generic items can definitely help a lot. You can save 50 percent on aver-
age over the leading competitor.
 Use “old-fashioned” household cleaning products instead of expensive clean-
ers. This approach nets even more savings than buying generic. Boric acid,
ammonia, and vinegar can replace almost all traditional household cleaners. A
substantial supply of these effective cleaning products will run you about $3. You
can easily spend two to three times that amount per month on modern house-
hold cleaning products that work no better. Peroxide and baking soda are effec-
tive and inexpensive alternatives to toothpaste, tooth-whitening products, and
mouthwash. One year’s supply of baking soda and peroxide sets you back almost
$2. However, the equivalent store-bought products can easily cost more than
$100 for a family of four.
 Don’t buy items that you won’t use often. Sure, an item may be on sale, but if
you don’t use it, don’t spend the money on it, no matter how great a deal it is.
 Don’t buy impulsively. If the item you want to purchase isn’t on sale, I recom-
mend a 30-day “cooling off” period. After 30 days, if you still feel you must buy
the item, you may return to the store and purchase it. Now the purchase is a
planned expenditure and not an impulse decision. However, what tends to
happen is that after a few days, the item no longer has the attraction it originally
had, and the hassle of returning to the store for that one item may be enough to
deter you.

Perhaps these ideas have given you some food for thought on how you can adjust your

time to take hold in your life.
Entertaining on a Shoestring
Do you want to socialize with friends and family while spending as little money as pos-
sible? Here are a few ideas that are proven winners:
 Covered-dish dinners: Hosts provide the main course, and guests bring side
dishes and desserts. The benefits of this type of gathering are that no one has
too much work or cost to absorb and everyone gets to try lots of new and varied
dishes. Bring the kids, hire one babysitter or older child to sit or entertain the
children in the basement (or a separate part of the house), and the adults can
visit or play cards upstairs or in the living room.
 Wine-tasting party: This type of get together can be a very educational and fun
experience (and not to mention thrifty). Here’s how it works: The host’s respon-
sibilities are to invite friends or family, lay out the rules, and provide glasses,
crackers, fruit, and cheese for all. Then guests each bring a bottle of wine. The
host predetermines the rules, such as the following: Bring red wine, $10/bottle
maximum, with bottles disguised in paper bags. After all the guests have arrived,
randomly number the bags, open the wine bottles, and begin the tasting. Discuss
the characteristics and qualities of each wine and vote on your favorite while
enjoying your cheese, fruit, and crackers and the company of your friends. At the
end, unveil the winning selection.
92
Part II: Getting the Most Out of Your Money 

 Football party: Hosts provide the theme entrée, which has something to do with
the opposing team. For example, if your team is playing the Miami Dolphins, you
may want to serve fish tacos. Rotate hosts with each game.
 Game night: Invite two to four people over after dinner to play Farkel (dice game
of skill and luck; all you need is six dice and the instructions, which you can find
on the Internet) or another game of your choice.
Using Worksheet 6-7, brainstorm ideas on how you can bring people together, have a
lot of fun, yet spend very little money. I’m sure your friends and family will appreciate
the quality time together as well as the frugality of these events.

Chapter 7
Involving Your Family 
in Personal Finance
In This Chapter
 Getting the family on board
 Making everyone accountable for money management
 Discovering ways to involve your children
Your financial plan should involve the dreams, goals, resources, and responsibilities of
the entire family. If your family is made up of just you, you’re the Chief Financial Officer
or CFO of You, Inc.; achieving unanimous support of your financial mission should be pretty
doable. However, if you have a spouse, partner, or children, you may have the responsibility
of performing the functions of CFO, cheerleader, and coach. You may need to provide the
guidance, encouragement, and support your family needs to develop a financial plan and
follow it through. The success of any financial plan is dependent on the support, persist-
ence, and dedication of all people involved.
Without the participation of the entire household, you’ll face a continual uphill battle when
it comes to your finances. In this chapter, I focus on communicating big-picture objectives
as well as day-to-day and ongoing roles and responsibilities with all family members. I also
share examples of how you can involve your children in your daily interactions with money
and help empower them to make money-wise decisions for themselves while supporting the
family’s financial planning efforts.
Making Financial Planning a Family Affair
Remember the little yellow road-sign shaped signs often seen in the back window of so many
cars and minivans — Baby on Board? Hey, you may even have one of those signs yourself.
Although some people post this sign because they’re proud parents, most people do it to alert
fellow drivers that they have very precious cargo on board.
This slogan can be carried over to your personal financial life: Family on Board! You have
very precious cargo that is sharing this financial life journey with you; they are depending
on you. Good!

Your family also needs to be “on board” conceptually. Your spouse, partner, or chil-
dren can be a help or a hindrance. As a family, you will face many challenges along
your financial journey. But if family members are truly on board, they will work to help
find solutions and not create additional challenges for you.
How do you get your family on board with your financial goals? You must inspire them,
just like a coach might. A coach needs the cooperation and coordination of each player
on his team. In order to get teams to pull together, great coaches lead by example and
command the utmost respect from each and every team member. Their team members
strive to perform at their very best each and every game, not only for themselves, but
also for their coach and their team. Great coaches inspire greatness.
So how can you inspire your family when it comes to your personal finances? Share
your vision, in living color, with your family members — your team. When you present
your vision, make sure that you include the vivid details of why a goal is important to
you and your family, and what accomplishing this goal will enable you all to enjoy.
Elaborate on the payoff for putting in the hard work, compromise, or sacrifices that
may be required to achieve these goals. The example in Worksheet 7-1 not only points
out the objective but also provides a few suggestions to help engage family members
into designing creative solutions instead of just focusing on problems. The example
also highlights the fact that choices must be made and concludes with the critical
What’s in it for me? element.
Worksheet 7-1
Involving Your Family (Example)
We can have most of the things that really matter to each of us and our family. However, we 
can’t have everything that each of us may want. Heck, no one can. Even rich people can’t. If we 
come together to make wise decisions about our money, we will be able to do more of the things 
we would really love to do and less of the stuff that none of us wants to do — even though 
these things still must get done.
For instance, let's talk about yard work.
Option #1: We could hire a company to care for our lawn and pay them for their service, but then 
we don’t have that money to do something we would rather do.
Option #2: We could share the lawn work and use the money we save to do something fun, like go 
to the water park after we’re done doing yard work. If all of us chip in, we could get the lawn work 
done in a couple of hours and spend the rest of the day at the water park. It wouldn’t cost any 
more than Option #1, but doesn’t that sound like more fun?
Option #3: I could do all the yard by myself. Because I’ll be busy with yard work, I won’t be 
available to accompany you to the swimming pool. Plus, I’ll be tired and dirty and not really up 
for doing much of anything the rest of the day. So, you’ll just have to find something around the 
house to do. And I’d like to add that taking care of “our” yard by myself all the time isn’t really 
how I want to spend my time either.
We all have decisions to make. We only have so much money to work with and lots of things that 
we need and want to do. We can’t have everything we need and want, so we have to make 
choices. Let’s talk about other family responsibilities and the choices we have.

Now you must figure out how to inspire your own family. I provide you with some
space in Worksheet 7-2 to write down what you’d like to say to your family as you seek
to bring them on board with your financial future. What subjects are near and dear to
your spouse’s or children’s hearts? Start there — they’ll be highly motivated to help
you help them get what they want.

Sharing Money-Management Responsibilities
Allowing and encouraging your family members to participate in the family’s financial
decisions and money-management responsibilities is beneficial in many ways. But
mainly, the more informed everyone is, the more you can work together for your
shared goals.
I don’t know how many times I’ve heard the line, “We never learned about money at
school, and my parents definitely never talked about it — at least while we were
around.” Where are your children going to learn to make informed decisions about
money if you don’t teach them? What happens to the spouse or partner who was
never interested or involved in the family finances if something happens to you? Are
you really doing them any favors by taking on this responsibility single-handedly?
The answer is no. You must make managing money a shared responsibility within your
family. No one learns this stuff in school; it’s an on-the-job learning experience. Allow
your family some on-the-job experience while you’re around for guidance. For exam-
ple, Worksheet 7-3 explores some ways that one individual shares money-management
responsibilities with his family members — for his benefit and theirs. After reading
through Worksheet 7-3, write down in your own words your desires and thoughts
about involving your family in the big picture financial goals and decisions, as well as
your periodic and daily responsibilities, in Worksheet 7-4.

Big Picture/Decisions
My spouse and I will work together to design a financial plan that will help our family 
accomplish our most cherished financial objectives. We will use this workbook as the 
foundation to design our financial plan and to serve as a guide for our discussions about 
money.
I will take on the lead role as the family's CFO. However, I want my spouse to be involved in all 
major decisions affecting our future. If anything ever happens to me, I want to make certain 
that my surviving family will be okay.
Monthly Meetings
Once a month, my spouse and I will sit down and invest an hour reflecting on how we 
progressed toward our goals in the previous month, what issues or opportunities may be 
facing us in the near future, and how we can and should deal with these issues together. We 
pledge to set aside one hour at the same time each month to have a productive conversation 
about our family's finances. We pledge not to focus our conversation on what we did wrong, 
but rather use this time to reinforce the positive behaviors that we want to instill in 
ourselves, each other, and our children.
My spouse is really not interested in personal finance. However, she recognizes that this is 
very important to me and for our family. I don't want her to feel that I hold the purse strings. 
I don't want to be the bad guy or the one who is always telling our children no. We are a 
partnership. I need her input, cooperation, and support.
Daily Responsibilities
Although my spouse isn't nearly as interested in financial planning as I am, she’s the primary 
day-to-day financial manager and decision maker for our household. She is also more likely to 
interact with our children regarding the constant decisions that we have to make about 
money. Both of us are very motivated to raise money-wise kids. We feel that the more we 
involve our children and allow them to participate in these discussions and decisions, the 
more they will learn, and the more supportive they will be of our family's financial plan.

Raising Money-Wise Kids
Involving your children in money management discussions and decisions is extremely
valuable. (See the section “Making Financial Planning a Family Affair” earlier in this
chapter for more details.) Children can be helpful or very challenging when it comes to
effectively managing your money.
I’d like to share ways you can interact with your children to help instill healthy money-
management behaviors in them:
 Give children specific roles with regard to daily money management activities.
Ideas include opening and sorting the mail or depositing everyone’s change (coins)
into the families “vacation fund” jar each day.
Involve children in periodic responsibilities, such as helping to pay bills by writing
checks and stuffing envelopes, clipping coupons from the Sunday paper, going into
the bank and interacting with the teller, or making decisions and purchases for the
family when grocery shopping.
99
Chapter 7: Involving Your Family in Personal Finance

 Help children discover that compromises are normal. No one can have every-
thing they could ever want or dream about. The smarter you are about each and
every money management decision, the more you’ll have to work with for the
things that matter most.
 Allow your children the opportunity to earn their own money and make their
own decisions about what to do with it — with minimal influence on your part.
If it isn’t dangerous or illegal — regardless of how practical you think it is —
allow them to proceed. This is the best time and place for your children to prac-
tice managing their money. Having this kind of responsibility and autonomy —
while living under your roof — gives them opportunity to feel the pain of making
bad decisions, but they’ll learn invaluable lessons about money management
while you’re nearby to provide guidance when necessary.
Here’s a great example of these principles: Not long ago I was at a Walgreen’s and wit-
nessed a young mother interacting with her three children, all under age seven, in the
most amazing way I’ve ever seen.
The woman was unloading a small grocery cart at the checkout counter with the help of
her sons. Her daughter was carrying a fistful of coupons. I overheard the woman enthusi-
astically tell her children that because of a special on tuna fish, they were able to buy six
cans for the price of three. They also took advantage of many other two-for-one specials,
and the mother was very alert to share this fact with her children. The children picked
up on the mother’s enthusiasm and were excited with their accomplishments.
After all the purchases were rung up by the cashier, the woman asked her daughter to
hand their coupons to the cashier. When the receipt was produced, all the kids huddled
around their mother to see the results of their shopping adventure. They discussed
the receipt together, and once again, the mother enthusiastically stressed exactly how
much money they saved with their coupons. The daughter yelled, “Yeah, Mommy!”
with the same kind of joy and excitement that you would expect when winning a Little
League baseball game. And this was just a trip to Walgreen’s.
This young mother had successfully engaged her children in the joys of being involved
in day-to-day money management decisions. They each had a role and responsibilities.
They worked as a team. They didn’t buy candy or toys. They didn’t whine or pout. They
had fun and were learning extremely valuable lessons.
Imagine having that kind of fun with your kids at a drugstore or a grocery store. Take a
moment now and consider ways that you can involve your children in daily activities
and responsibilities that affect the family’s finances.
In Worksheet 7-5, consider ways to involve your children in the family’s finances. Think
of ways your children are, or could become more, involved from earning their own
money doing chores around the house or making decisions about spending money.
For example, say that your daughter is turning 10 in a couple of months. This is an
occasion for a big birthday bash. Explore all the different, fun things that she’d like to
do, while staying within a set budget. You pick the budget amount and let her propose
the possibilities she has explored.
Or say that your son wants a car when he turns 16. What options are available to help
him to acquire a car and pay for insurance, gasoline, and upkeep? Are you willing and
able to contribute financially? If so, to what extent can you transfer some or all of the
very grownup responsibility to your son?

I’m not a fan of anyone giving money to their children in the form of an allowance with-
out certain responsibilities attached. No one receives a paycheck just for being a
member of the family. Everyone has duties and responsibilities. If you elect to provide
your children with an allowance, it should be directly tied to the adequate and com-
plete fulfillment of their contributions to the family.
For example, a 4-year-old has very little need for money, but it’s a great age to begin
learning about how to make smart money decisions, and the direct correlation
between work and reward: I’ll pay you $1 per week if you pick up your toys, help set
the dinner table, and make sure that the cat has food and water.
I strongly encourage you to allow your children to make as many decisions as possi-
ble about how they spend their money — given some minimal guidelines for safety.
Without the opportunity to practice making wise financial decisions, children won’t
learn these valuable lessons until much later in life, when they’re likely dealing with
much more significant issues. Allow them to make little mistakes and grow from those
mistakes while you’re around to guide and direct them.
101
Chapter 7: Involving Your Family in Personal Finance

For example, I once worked with a family who had a wonderful, simple way of handling
the subject of allowances with their children. This couple’s policy was that every
member of the family had jobs to do, and no one got paid to do these jobs.
To give you an idea, their two children, ages 4 and 6, had the responsibility of making
their beds every morning. They also were expected to pick up their dirty clothes, toys,
and homework and return those items to their respective places when finished. The
children also helped prepare the dinner meal and load the dishwasher. They could
earn allowances for any jobs performed above and beyond the required family respon-
sibilities. And all money earned from any source, including allowances, and gifts,
would be divided into three categories; one-third must be saved, one-third must be
shared, and the remaining one-third could be spent (see Worksheet 7-6), which played
itself out in the following ways:
 Saved: The children had savings accounts at their local bank, and every time
they received any money, the first thing they would do is trot down to the bank
and deposit one-third of the money in the bank account. The children would
carry their own money, instruct the teller as to what they wanted to do, and did
this all with little or no intervention from their parents.
 Shared: The second portion of the children’s money could be shared in any way
that the child deemed appropriate, as long as the money was being shared with
people in need. The children generally contributed the money to their church.
When the couple’s son was a little older, he learned of a boy named Byron in a
remote village in Africa. The boy was the same age as the couple’s son. Byron
truly needed the basic essentials of life — clean water, food, and healthcare. The
couple’s young son was so deeply moved by the story of Byron that he decided
that he wanted to become Byron’s sponsor. One-third of his income would not
be enough money to provide the monthly sponsorship fee. However, that didn’t
stop this motivated young man. He knew that he was genuinely blessed. He had
the opportunity to raise more money by doing chores around his house, for his
extended family and for neighbors. He made the choice himself. He wanted to
sponsor Byron and that is exactly what he did. They became pen pals, and to
this day, both boys’ lives have been changed for the better — and it all started
with the parents’ policy that their children must share one-third of their income
with someone else in need.
 Spent: The final third of any income earned or received could be spent. These
parents allowed their children a considerable amount of freedom with regard to
how they elected to spend their money. They could spend their money immedi-
ately, but when it was gone, it was gone. No loans or advances came from Mom
and Dad. If the children spent their money each and every week, nothing would
be left for a bigger purchase later. Over time, the children learned to budget their
money and plan their expenditures to get the best “bang-for-their-bucks.”
Suffice it to say that these parents knew how to raise money-wise kids, and you would
be wise to follow in their footsteps.

Minimizing Taxes
In This Chapter
 Paying just as much tax as you’re required
 Itemizing or taking the standard deduction
 Reducing your burden at tax time
T
he easiest way to minimize the taxes you pay is to not make any money. However, that’s
not a smart financial-planning strategy. My objective is to make as much money as I can,
while paying as little tax as possible.
You may be like me — the subject of taxes isn’t something I enjoy studying or even thinking
much about. But neither you nor I can ignore the subject — it won’t go away. Knowing some
important, yet often misunderstood basics, like those that I cover in this chapter, can help
make sure that you’re not missing out.
For a more in-depth and lengthy discussion on your taxes, check out the latest version of
Taxes For Dummies by Eric Tyson, also brought to you by Wiley Publishing.
Paying No More Taxes Than You Have to Pay
You may shortchange yourself and not take the deductions for which you’re entitled because
you’re worried about being audited. Or possibly you may be paying too much tax by not
understanding the benefits of itemizing deductions. Another common misunderstanding is
the real value of tax deductions. For most people, just getting your stuff together to prepare
your returns each year is burdensome, but it doesn’t have to be this way. In this chapter,
I address each of these issues simply and directly.
Discovering AGI and your effective tax rate
Your AGI is your adjusted gross income, a number you need to know if you’re planning on
pursuing deductions (and for exercises in this chapter). The quickest way for you to deter-
mine your AGI is to refer back to your last tax return. You can find your AGI for the previous
year on the first page of your 1040 return on line 37. If your income and deductible expenses
aren’t expected to change much this year as compared to last year, use last year’s AGI for
your planning purposes throughout this chapter.

Another important bit of information you should calculate while you have your tax
return out is your effective tax rate, which is the actual percentage of your gross
income that you pay in income taxes Here’s how you do it:
1. On the first page of your 1040, find your Total Income on line 22.
2. Move on to the second page of your 1040 and locate your Total Tax on line 63.
3. Divide line 63 by line 22 to determine your federal effective tax rate.
4. To approximate your total tax rate, including state and local income taxes,
refer to those tax returns, identify your Total Tax, and divide that amount by
your Total Income.
5. Add your federal tax rate to your state and local tax rates to arrive at your 
total effective tax rate.
By knowing how much of every dollar you earn goes out in taxes, you’re better able to
make informed decisions about the real cost of any money decision. For example, if
you have an effective tax rate of 30 percent, you’d have to earn about $1.43 to net one
dollar, after-tax to spend.
You’ll also want to know your effective tax rate to be able to more accurately deter-
mine the value of tax-deductible expenses. This knowledge helps keep things in per-
spective. 
Figuring out your allowable deductions
So how do you know what you can safely deduct on your taxes? If you don’t own a
home or aren’t making large charitable contributions, you may likely be best served by
taking the standard deduction. The standard deduction is every taxpayer’s minimum
“gift” from the IRS. You’re entitled to the larger of the standard deduction or your item-
ized deduction. However, if you don’t qualify for the standard deduction, generally
because someone else — like your parent — claims you as a dependent on his or her
tax return, but you have significant medical or dental expenses, pay interest or real
estate taxes on your home, or make large charitable contributions, you can save a sub-
stantial amount of money by itemizing your deductions.
Quickly review Worksheet 8-1 to determine whether itemizing may benefit you. Indicate
with a checkmark the items that apply to your personal situation. If you mark home
mortgage interest alone, that may be enough to warrant itemizing. Go ahead and mark
all items that may apply to you.
Worksheet 8-1
Tax Deduction Opportunities
Mortgage Interest (Use Form 1098 received from lender in January of each year):
❏Mortgage on primary residence
❏Second mortgage on primary residence
❏Home equity line of credit
❏Mortgage on second home/vacation home
❏Other mortgages
❏Discount points paid on mortgage
106
Part II: Getting the Most Out of Your Money 

Note: Points that you pay when you initially buy your primary residence are deductible
in that year. However, if you refinance or the property isn’t your primary residence,
points are deducted gradually over the life of the loan.
Real Estate and Property Taxes (Keep receipt of taxes paid):
❏Real estate taxes paid on primary residence
❏Real estate taxes paid on secondary residence
❏Property taxes paid on personal property
State and Local Income Taxes:
❏Boxes 17 and 19 Form W-2 received from employer in late January
❏Estimated state and local tax payments made
❏State and local tax refunds from prior tax year applied to current year’s liability
Charitable Donations:
❏Cash donations
❏Donations of property
Medical Expenses (must exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income [AGI] to be
deductible):
❏Deductible medical expenses include medical insurance premiums you pay,
doctors’ fees, hospital and lab fees, prescription drugs, medical supplies, dental
and vision care costs, and supplies.
Note: Although medical expenses are deductible, you likely won’t get to deduct these
expenses because they must exceed 7.5 percent of your AGI to apply.
Miscellaneous Tax Deductions (must exceed 2 percent of AGI to be deductible):
❏Union or professional dues paid
❏Subscriptions for work-related publications
❏Cost of uniforms or equipment required for employment
❏Cost of continuing education required for employment
❏IRA custodial fees if you pay these fees directly
❏Safe deposit box rental
❏Investment advisory and tax preparation fees and expenses
❏Cost of books and periodicals used in managing your investments
❏Legal fees if they involve your job, taxes, or investments
Remember that Worksheet 8-1 isn’t an exhaustive list, but it covers the majority of
items that likely apply to you. For more information, or if you’re just having trouble
getting to sleep, read IRS Publication 529. Go to  www.irs.gov/publications/p529/
index.html to read this publication online.

Chapter 8: Minimizing Taxes

As the documents listed in Worksheet 8-1 come to you throughout the year, place them
in a file labeled Tax Info, and you’ll be one giant step closer to having your paperwork
together to complete your tax return. For more on this topic, check out the section
“Maintaining Good Records” later in this chapter.
Itemized deductions are limited or phased out if your AGI exceeds $156,400 for single,
married filing jointly, and head of household taxpayers ($78,200 for married filing sepa-
rately). Unfortunately, you can do little if you find that your itemized deductions are
limited or phased out because of your income being too high unless you anticipate your
earnings dropping significantly next year. If that is highly likely, you’d be best served by
postponing any payment of tax-deductible items until next year, if possible, when your
deductions won’t be limited.
Other than that, just keep this fact in mind: The value of your itemized deductions may
not be as great as they appear, due to the phase out for people with higher incomes.
So if you’re one of the lucky ones who makes too much money, Uncle Sam has found
another way to get a bit more.
Getting specific with charitable deductions
Knowing how to claim charitable contributions can get a bit sticky, but don’t worry.
The process is easier than you might think. The IRS states that you’re entitled to
deduct the fair market value (meaning what a willing buyer would pay) of items, in
good condition, that you donate to qualifying charities. However, the vast majority of
people miss out on tax savings to which they’re legally entitled because they don’t
know how to determine the fair market value for their donations.
For the simplest method of figuring out the fair market value of particular items you
donate, I suggest using the TurboTax ItsDeductible program if you make regular dona-
tions of personal property. The software costs about $20 and can easily save you many
times that amount in taxes. The ItsDeductible program has compiled pricing data
based on extensive research of resale outlets as well as recent market data from eBay
and provides you with the fair market value of an item as well as a detailed report for
your tax filing purposes. And you shouldn’t need to buy the software each year
because values tend to remain fairly steady or inflate slightly over time.
The rules changed in 2006 regarding charitable contributions. Now you must get a
receipt from the charity substantiating all your contributions or donations. Also, items
must now be in “good” or better condition to qualify for a deduction.
Determining Whether the Itemized or
Standard Deduction Is Best for You
You should itemize your deductions if your total deductions are more than the stan-
dard deduction (see Worksheet 8-2). For each dollar that exceeds the standard deduc-
tion, you will reduce your taxable income by that amount.
Example: Your itemized deduction exceeds the standard deduction by $5,000. If you
have an effective tax rate of 30 percent, you will save yourself an additional $1,500 in
taxes by itemizing ($5,000 x 0.30 = $1,500).

Use Worksheet 8-1 to guesstimate whether the sum of your itemized deductions will
exceed the standard deduction that you’re entitled to take. (If you haven’t yet completed
this worksheet, I suggest you do so now.) If you own a home, make substantial charitable
contributions, or pay substantial state and/or local real estate or property taxes, you will
be best served by itemizing. Worksheet 8-2 provides you the opportunity to tally up the
total of your anticipated deductions if you itemize. Worksheet 8-3 illustrates whether you’d
save more money by itemizing your deductions or by taking the standard deduction.

Calculate your net result.
109
Chapter 8: Minimizing Taxes

After completing Worksheet 8-4, you know that you should itemize your deductions if
the net result is a positive number; however, if the net result is negative, you should
take the standard deduction.
If you aren’t married but co-own a home with someone, you can actually save a lot of
money with proper tax planning. Arrange your expenditures so that one person,
preferably the person in the highest tax bracket, pays all the tax-deductible expenses
for the household, such as the mortgage payment and charitable contributions. The
other co-owner then pays for nondeductible household expenses, such as groceries,
utilities, and so on. This way, one of you is able to take the full itemized deduction,
while the other one takes the standard deduction. This strategy could save you up to
$2,000 per year. However, married couples filing jointly or separately can’t do this.
Overestimating the value of the tax breaks available with home ownership is a common
misunderstanding. The after-tax cost of a home mortgage is more expensive than most
people are led to believe. For example, you have $13,000 in mortgage interest, real
estate taxes, and few other deductions. Your total itemized deductions are $13,000.
However, you were entitled to a standard deduction of $10,300 regardless of your
expenses merely by being married and filing jointly. So the real tax deductible benefit
of your home mortgage and property taxes is less than $2,700, not $13,000. Generally,
you receive a very small incremental tax break by having a mortgage.
Real estate agents, mortgage brokers, financial advisors, and possibly you frequently
adjust your gross mortgage interest rate by your marginal tax bracket and conclude
that your mortgage is only costing you X amount after adjusting for the tax savings.
For example, say that your home mortgage rate is 6.25 percent. If you were to adjust
for tax savings by multiplying your mortgage rate times your tax bracket (for example,
0.0625 x [1–0.33] x 100 = 4.19 percent), you would say that your net after-tax cost of the
mortgage is 4.19 percent. Wrong! You were entitled to the standard deduction, so the
difference between the two numbers is the real benefit. Your net cost of the mortgage
rate is closer to 5.84 percent.
Maintaining Good Records
Throughout the year, you likely receive a significant amount of paperwork, some of
which needs to be retained to prepare your tax return. Other documents may need to
be retained to substantiate prior-year tax reporting. Maintaining your documents in an
organized fashion will not only help you avoid missing valuable deductions to which
you may be entitled, but will also help ensure that your income tax return is complete
and accurate. If not, you can be out a lot of money in penalties and interest when
errors are discovered.
If you haven’t already segregated this paperwork into its appropriate files, I recom-
mend that you flip over to Chapter 2, where I give you a detailed description about
how to get your paperwork in order. As you wade through this stack of paperwork,
you will likely find the necessary documentation needed to prepare your income taxes.
Worksheet 8-5 lists the files I recommend to keep your tax-related documents organ-
ized. These files should be incorporated into your general household filing or record-
keeping system, which you can find in Chapter 2. And when tax time rolls around, all
you have to do is pull out these files, and you’re ready to prepare your tax return.

Maintaining efficiently organized and complete records related to your personal finances
helps you in so many ways. Not only can you avoid wasting time or stressing out when
you can’t find important documents, but you can also avoid wasting money in late pay-
ment fees and additional interest charges, not to mention how much better you will feel
should you get one of those wonderful audit notices in the mail from the IRS.
I once read a quote in the Wall Street Journal that said the average white-collar worker
spends six weeks every year looking for stuff. I’m sure you can find a lot better way to
spend your precious time. Invest a few hours to set up a logical filing system for your-
self and implement that system. You’ll be glad you did!

B
efore making any impulse purchases or signing contracts to make a big purchase,
invest time to explore the rationale for these decisions and how they may impact your
other financial objectives. All your choices matter, especially the larger ones involving your
money, so take a moment to think them through and do a little number-crunching before
you buy.
After you’ve determined that the expenditure is worth making, proceed wisely. In this chap-
ter, I explain key issues involved in making common big-ticket purchase decisions and help
you become a more financially savvy consumer.
Evaluating a Big-Ticket Purchase
When confronted with a decision about making a big-ticket purchase ask yourself, “Is this [fill
in the blank] one of my most important financial objectives?” If your answer is no, step back
and ask yourself the following:
 What am I willing to give up in order to have this item?
 Is spending money on this big-ticket purchase really worth it?
If you answer yes, substitute one of your primary financial objectives and do as a savvy
shopper would do. Spend away — carefully, that is.
Here’s an example: Would you choose to trade your car in on a newer model now, even
though it’s running perfectly fine? Ask yourself what sacrifices you’d be willing to make:
 Are you willing to work 20 hours of overtime per week for six months?
 Are you willing to sell your motorcycle?
 Are you willing to charge the cost of your plane tickets to Florida next winter (which
ends up costing you twice as much as paying cash)?

Too many times you may take the easiest short-term option and say, “Charge it.”
Financing provides immediate gratification and postpones the pain of having to pay for
a while. If you aren’t willing to raise or earn what you need to make this purchase
immediately, you need to ask yourself: Is this thing so important that you’re willing to
give up twice as much for it over time? These decisions can make or break your finan-
cial plans.
You will have times when financing a big-ticket item is the only way to purchase what
you need. The primary big-ticket items, other than retirement and college funding, are
homes and vehicles, which you likely need or choose to finance. But before you
finance anything, make sure that you have all the relevant facts, enabling you to make
an informed, thoughtful decision. (Read more about financing in the section “Exploring
Your Home Financing Options.”)
Owning Your Own Home: The Pros and Cons
Before getting into financing strategies, start with a thorough examination of the pros
and cons of your decision to buy a home. If the advantages outweigh the disadvan-
tages, proceed to the financing discussion. If they don’t, you haven’t wasted much
time, and you’ve avoided making a costly financial mistake.
If you’re considering buying a house or selling the one you currently own, use
Worksheet 9-1 to guide your decision as to whether home ownership is right for you.

Part III: Thinking about the Future 

In Worksheet 9-1, you identify the major advantages and disadvantages of owning a
home. This decision involves considering all reasonable options before you come to a
final conclusion. Can you lease an apartment or home and better fulfill your personal
needs and objectives? Are there any other options to consider?
Another important consideration is how long you plan to stay in the home. As a gen-
eral rule, to cover just the costs of buying and selling the home (which includes
obtaining a mortgage and an appraisal, application fees, inspections, movers, title
insurance, legal fees, and real estate commissions), a property has to appreciate at
least 15 to 20 percent for you to break even. In addition to knowing how long you plan
on staying in the home, you also need to be able to guesstimate how your new home
will appreciate over that time. In most real estate markets, this rate of appreciation
typically takes three to seven years.
Buying a home makes little or no sense if you don’t plan to stay there at least three
years. Nolo, the nation’s oldest and most respected provider of legal information for
consumers, has a series of great calculators you can access at no charge through their
Web site at www.nolo.com. One is entitled, “Should I rent or buy?” You plug in all the
facts and assumptions, such as inflation rate on rental prices, your tax rate, average
maintenance costs when owning your own home, appreciation expectations, and how
long you plan to stay, and the calculator does the math for you.
If you determine that purchasing a home has overwhelmingly more advantages than
disadvantages, and you’re confident of your willingness and ability to stay in the home
for a number of years, you can begin to explore how much home you can afford.
Figuring Out How Much Home You Can Afford
Worksheet 9-2 allows you to compute the maximum amount you likely can afford to
spend on your monthly mortgage payment. You can then use this monthly mortgage
cost to compute how much house you can afford to buy in Worksheet 9-4. (Worksheet
9-3 walks you through those calculations.)
If you have a positive number on the last two lines of Worksheet 9-2, you have met the
healthy borrowing guidelines. Even if you have a negative number in either the front
ratio or back ratio columns, you may be fine carrying this much debt. However,
exceeding both ratios for any length of time is unwise.
Your real estate agent and mortgage lender are there to help you buy as much house
as you can qualify to buy. That doesn’t mean that you can afford it. Real estate agents
and some lenders couldn’t care less about these “old-fashioned” guidelines. Real
estate prices have skyrocketed in recent years, and some lenders will lend money to
people without credit or much income. Watch out! They aren’t doing you any favors.

Another guideline for determining how much house you can afford — one you may
have heard about — is that you can qualify for a mortgage equal to 21⁄2 to 3 times your
gross annual wages (see Worksheet 9-3). These results are remarkably similar to those
produced using the front- and back-end ratios, but they’re not as precise. However,
this simple calculation will get you in the ballpark.

Exploring Your Home Financing Options
You’ve determined that you want to buy a house. The worksheets from the preceding
section helped you gather essential information so you can now determine what
financing options you have available and how best to maximize those options.
Here are some key questions you need to consider to determine the most appropriate
type of mortgage for you and your circumstances:
 How long do you plan to live in the home?
 Would you prefer a stable monthly payment, or can you handle the uncertainty
of an adjustable mortgage payment?
 How much money do you have to use as a down payment?
 Are you a veteran?
 Are you a first-time homebuyer?
 How is your credit?
Also consider the following key issues:
 Current fixed interest rates on conventional, FHA, and VA loans
 Current interest rates on adjustable-rate mortgages
• 3-year fixed, then annually adjustable-rate mortgage (3/1 ARM)
• 5-year fixed, then annually adjustable-rate mortgage (5/1 ARM)
Choosing between a fixed-rate mortgage
and an ARM
In the last few years, Americans have experienced historically low mortgage loan
rates. Conventional wisdom has been that if you can obtain a fixed-rate mortgage at
about 6 percent or less, you should lock in that rate for as long as possible. However,
conventional wisdom may not apply to your circumstances.
For example, I once bought a house and had the following mortgage options: a 30-year
fixed-rate mortgage for about 6 percent or a 3/1 ARM at 4.625 percent. I expected to
stay in the home for three to five years and definitely not more than seven. My initial
rate of 4.625 percent for the ARM was locked in for three years. At the end of the three-
year period, if interest rates increased, my rate could go up a maximum of 1 percent
each and every year. Given the substantial difference at the time between a 30-year
fixed and a 3/1 ARM, I calculated that in the worst-case scenario, I would reach the
point where I would break even in year seven. (For more on the break-even point,
check out the section “Determining your break-even point” later in this chapter.)
If you’re in a similar position (not planning on staying in a property for more than five
to eight years), you likely would be best served considering an adjustable-rate mort-
gage (ARM). However, the decision depends on the differential between the 30-year
fixed mortgage rates and interest rates available on 3/1 and 5/1 ARMs.

Part III: Thinking about the Future 

For up-to-date rates on all types of mortgages in your area, visit www.bankrate.com.
Bankrate provides information, quotes, and calculators to assist you in making
informed decisions about your home-financing options based on rates available in
your market at that very moment. Your local newspaper likely also publishes current
mortgage rates available in your market.
Currently, you can’t find much benefit in taking an adjustable-rate mortgage compared
to a fixed-rate mortgage. However, when the difference between a fixed rate and an
ARM is 0.5 percent or more, and you have a high likelihood that you won’t be in the
property much longer than the fixed term of your adjustable-rate mortgage, you can
save money by selecting the ARM.
To determine the monthly principal and interest due on a mortgage balance at a specific
interest rate, visit www.bankrate.com or www.nolo.com and use the mortgage calcula-
tors. If you don’t have access to the Internet or a financial calculator, you can estimate
your annual mortgage payment with Worksheet 9-6. (See the example in Worksheet 9-5.)

Worksheet 9-6
Estimating Your Mortgage Payment
After you know the current interest rates available in the marketplace and the approxi-
mate amount of your monthly mortgage payment (from Worksheet 9-6), you can
decide, based on the numbers, whether a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate mortgage is
better for you and, if so, for how long.
Determining your break-even point
Your break-even point is the point in the future where the financial impact of your deci-
sion to go with one type of mortgage over another meets. Earlier in this chapter, I shared
a scenario about a time when I chose an ARM and didn’t reach my breakeven until the
seven-year mark. If I happened to sell the property or refinance the mortgage before the
seven-year mark time, I made a smart gamble by taking the adjustable rate mortgage.

Part III: Thinking about the Future 

For example (as you can see in Worksheet 9-7), in year four, my effective mortgage rate
was 5.625 percent, which was still below the initial fixed rate of 6 percent. So in this
scenario, for the first four years, I was clearly ahead by having the ARM. However,
where is the break-even point? Worksheet 9-7 illustrates how that break-even point was
computed. If I sold the property anytime before year seven, I would be ahead substan-
tially by selecting the 3/1 ARM, even if interest rates went straight up over those years.

Part III: Thinking about the Future 

Choosing your fixed-rate term
Assume that you plan to stay in your new home indefinitely and are most comfortable
selecting a fixed-term mortgage. You may be wondering whether you should take out a
15-, 20-, 30-, or one of those new 40-year fixed-rate mortgages.
Using Worksheet 9-9, consider the ramification of this decision. As you can see in this
worksheet, the buyer agrees to a purchase price of $235,000 and makes a down pay-
ment of 20 percent, which means the amount he is financing is $188,000. If he had
chosen a 30-year fixed rate, his payment would be $1,158 per month, excluding home-
owners insurance and real estate taxes. However, by choosing a 15-year fixed rate, he
obtains a lower interest rate but a much higher payment.

If you have ample and stable cash flow, plenty of cash reserves, and don’t like the idea
of having long-term mortgage debt, go with the 15-year mortgage. However, this is not
the case for most people. The difference in payment — approximately a third more
for the 15-year mortgage than for the 30-year mortgage — isn’t a commitment that
many people should take on.
By going with a 30-year fixed rate, the monthly payments are much more manageable
for most people. However, should you choose to accelerate the repayment of your
mortgage, which I’m not at all opposed to, you can retain the utmost flexibility while
still knocking years off your mortgage payments by simply adding an additional $100
per month to your mortgage payment. Of course, the more you can afford to pay, the
better, because you’ll pay off your mortgage faster and save a lot on interest.
If you pay more than your monthly payment, be sure to clearly specify to your mort-
gage company that the additional dollars are to be applied against the principal bal-
ance of your mortgage; otherwise, they won’t be.
You may have heard of biweekly mortgages. This concept has a lot of merit. However, you
shouldn’t have to pay extra for this service. You can create your own biweekly mortgage
by submitting one half of your monthly mortgage payment every other week in advance
of when it’s due. At the end of the year, you’ll have made 26 biweekly payments — the
equivalent of 13 monthly payments in a year. This simple strategy knocks about six years
off the term of the 30-year mortgage and saves you tens of thousands of dollars in inter-
est over the life of your mortgage.
125
Chapter 9: Planning for Big-Ticket Purchases

Comparing Mortgage Options
Shopping online for mortgages can be a very efficient way to research your mortgage
options, and it provides 24-hour convenience from the comfort of your own home
or office. I encourage you to visit www.fanniemae.com, www.freddiemac.com,
www.hud.gov, and www.mbaa.org. These Web sites offer information on mortgage
programs that may be available to first-time homebuyers, veterans, or other special-
interest groups.
When shopping online for a mortgage, you can also go directly to a specific lender’s
Web site, such as www.wellsfargo.com, or to an auction site, such as www.lending
tree.com. Auction sites allow you to complete a loan application, which is sent to a
number of lenders for their review. Those providers interested in providing you a loan
send you offers. The convenience of using the auction sites is that you only have to
complete one loan application, you generally don’t have an application fee (at least at
this point in the process), and you now have several mortgage options to compare.
Before obtaining a mortgage online with a company you’ve never heard of, be sure to
check with your state’s regulatory agency to verify whether they’re licensed and regu-
lated to do business in your state. You can check out the lender online with the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation at www.fdic.gov.
Even if you elect to get quotes from various mortgage providers online, I also suggest
that you check local mortgage providers. Your local newspaper most likely provides
quotes, at least on a weekly basis, for some of the most competitive mortgage lenders
in your community. You may find that working with a local mortgage provider is most
convenient. As you see later on in this section, the amount of paperwork that you’re
required to pull together and provide to the lender is substantial. When working with
a local lender, the loan-acquisition process may be easier than working with an online
lender.
Be sure to ask the following questions of potential mortgage lenders:
 What is the current interest rate of the mortgage being considered? (News
flash . . . the lower, the better!)
 Are discount points (money you spend to buy down the interest rate) or
origination points (fees that some lenders charge) included? Generally, you’ll
want a loan with the lowest interest rate without discount points. However, if
you have lots of extra cash on hand and plan to stay in the home for a very long
time, you may benefit from paying discount points. You should be able to com-
pletely avoid origination points.
 Will you please provide me with a good-faith estimate illustrating all my fees
and closing costs? If the lender refuses, then don’t do business with it!
 Can I lock in the interest rate, and if so, what will it cost me to do so? Lenders
will allow you to secure an interest rate in advance of closing on your mortgage.
You may want to lock in the current rate if you suspect rates will go up before
closing. Lenders will charge a fee to provide you with a guaranteed rate. The
lower the fee, the better!
 What is the minimum down payment required for this loan? Many loans
require a 20 percent down payment. The lender will need to know how much of a
down payment you plan on making to determine the right loan options for you.
126
Part III: Thinking about the Future 

 What is required for me to obtain a prequalification or preapproval letter?
(For more on preapproval, check out the “Getting Preapproved” section, later in
this chapter.)
 Is there a prepayment penalty on this loan? I can think of absolutely no reason
to obtain a mortgage that has a prepayment penalty. If the lender is offering a
loan with a penalty for paying it off early, walk away. The chances of your staying
in that home and not refinancing your mortgage at some point over the next 30
years are highly unlikely.
Use Worksheet 9-10 when gathering quotes and feedback on the preceding questions
from a variety of lenders.

You may find that you’re actually comparing two or more loans from the same mort-
gage company, which is fine. The attempt is to get you the most appropriate loan for
the best price.
You must remember that the cost of your mortgage includes not only the interest rate,
but also the closing costs, which can be substantial. Typically, you should anticipate
closing costs to be in the neighborhood of $1,200 to $1,500, but the closing costs do
vary greatly between lenders. Generally, these costs must be paid out of pocket, along
with any discount points at closing. However, closing costs and discount points are
negotiable items, and you may be able to negotiate with the seller to pay these costs
for you. If the seller isn’t paying these costs for you, don’t forget these additional costs
must be paid along with your down payment when you close on the mortgage and
obtain the deed to your new home.
Getting Preapproved
I strongly recommend that before you get serious about making an offer on a new
home, you obtain from your mortgage lender a prequalification letter at minimum, or
better yet, a preapproval letter.
A preapproval letter from a lender is much more significant than a prequalification
letter. Prequalification often takes just a few minutes, and many lenders provide this
service at no cost to you. However, a prequalification letter is a nonbinding offer by
the lender to provide you a loan for a certain amount of money. The problem with a
prequalification letter is that the lender hasn’t verified your financial information.
127
Chapter 9: Planning for Big-Ticket Purchases

Rather, they’re indicating that if everything you stated can be verified and your credit
rating is solid, they will provide you with this loan.
Preapproval, on the other hand, involves your lender actually verifying the financial
information you provide. The lender will contact anyone they need to receive verifica-
tion of your income, assets, debts, and credit history. After it verifies this information,
it issues a letter stating that you are approved for a certain amount of mortgage for a
certain period of time. Some lenders charge a small fee to provide a preapproval letter;
however, this fee is generally refunded to you at closing.
You have several very good reasons for obtaining a preapproval letter prior to entering
into any negotiations regarding the house purchase, including the following:
 Your mortgage company has done a thorough review of your financial informa-
tion and has provided you with the letter stating that they will give you a loan for
a certain amount of money. It’s obligating itself to provide you with this loan. A
potential buyer who already has a preapproval letter from a lender stands a
much better chance of having his purchase offer accepted than someone who is
making their offer contingent upon obtaining financing.
 The preapproval letter provides you with confirmation of how much money
(loan plus your down payment) you have available to spend on your new home.
Preapproved borrowers are attractive to potential sellers. Sellers don’t need to worry
that if they accept your offer, you could be turned down for a loan. Also, you may be
able to close more quickly than another competing buyer, because you have already
completed the time-consuming process of being approved for your mortgage.
If your financial circumstances change significantly from preapproval to closing, your
preapproval letter may no longer be valid. Contact your lender immediately if your cir-
cumstances change.
Hopefully, I’ve convinced you that obtaining a preapproval letter is another important
step in making that big-ticket purchase decision of buying a home. To obtain a prequal-
ification letter or a preapproval letter and, subsequently, a mortgage, lenders are going
to ask you a series of questions. The following is a list of the information and docu-
ments that you need to pull together to obtain your prequalification or preapproval
letter, and eventually your mortgage:
 Employment and income: Be able to answer these questions about your employ-
ment: Where do you work? How long have you worked there? How long have you
worked in the industry? What is your annual income? How is your compensation
derived? How stable is your income?
 Liabilities: Lenders will want you to answer these questions: What current debts
do you have? What is your minimum monthly payment required to satisfy these
debts? What is the actual monthly payment that you’ve been applying toward
these debts? Of your total debts, how much is directly applicable to credit cards
and auto loans?
 Assets: Be sure to know the answer to these questions: What is your current
bank balance? Where will the money come from to make your down payment
and pay any closing costs and discount points, if applicable?
 Credit: The lender won’t typically ask you any questions about your credit his-
tory and instead pulls a copy of your credit report.
128
Part III: Thinking about the Future 

I strongly encourage you to review your credit report personally to make certain that
you have done everything possible to improve its accuracy prior to making loan appli-
cation. Refer to Chapter 5 for more information.
Documents that you need to provide to your lender or prospective lender are listed in
Worksheet 9-11. As you prepare to apply for your loan, you can use this checklist to
make sure that you have all the necessary information.
Worksheet 9-11
Documents Needed for a Mortgage Application
❏Copies of your federal income tax returns and W-2s for the last two years
(However, if you are self-employed, additional income verification will most likely
be requested.)
❏Copies of the recent paycheck stubs showing your name and Social Security
number, name and address of your employer, and cumulative year-to-date infor-
mation on earnings and withholding
❏Proof of any other income, such as interest and dividends, Social Security,
Veterans benefits, disability or retirement benefits, alimony, or child support
❏List of all creditors, balances owed, and minimum monthly payments required
❏Verification of all assets including retirement account statements, brokerage
account statements, mutual fund statements, and any other investment assets or
savings
❏Verification of your current mortgage or rent payments
❏Eventually, a sales contract for the house that you’d like to buy (Of course,
a sales contract doesn’t apply during the preapproval stage.)
Finding the Right Home
Now that you have invested time determining the amount of money you can afford to
spend on a new home, the type of mortgage that may be most appropriate for you, and
a preapproval letter from the lender of your choice, it’s time to go house hunting.
I encourage you to begin in your home search by driving around prospective neighbor-
hoods, visiting open houses, and utilizing the Web to do a lot of your preliminary
legwork.
Many Web sites draw from a central database, also known as the Multiple Listing
Service (MLS). The National Association of Realtors has one of these Web sites at
www.realtor.com. Another resource is www.homes.com. In many locales, major real
estate companies dominate the marketplace. I encourage you to also visit their Web
sites.
Pinpointing the key features
Before you get too attached to a certain property, make sure that you have thought
through the issues that are most important to you and what you want out of this new
home. Consider using Worksheet 9-12 as a guideline and brainstorm on the issues that
are most critical when comparing properties. Complete one worksheet per property

Hiring a real estate agent
As a home buyer, consider hiring a real estate professional as your buyer’s agent. It costs
you nothing and can save you thousands of dollars.
I suggest that you save your additional time and energy and allow a real estate agent,
empowered with the information in Worksheet 9-12, to locate the properties best meet-
ing your needs. If you have little or no experience buying a home — this is a must! If
you are too busy doing what you do for a living and taking care of your family, let a real
estate agent work for you.
Find a real estate professional that has extensive experience buying and selling proper-
ties in the neighborhoods in which you are most interested. Cruise the neighborhood
and jot down the names, phone numbers, and companies of the realtors listing
properties — also, notate the properties’ addresses. Then, when you return home,
visit the real estate agents’ companies’ Web sites, read about the real estate agents,
and check out the properties listed. Soon you will discover who the “movers and
shakers” are in your target real estate market.
Knowing When to Refinance
When you’re considering refinancing a loan, you look at many of the same issues that
you initially looked at when checking out your loan options, including the following:
 How long do you plan to stay in the home?
 What is your current interest rate?
 What interest rate could you obtain on a new mortgage?
131
Chapter 9: Planning for Big-Ticket Purchases

 Will you be refinancing your mortgage and pulling out additional cash to use for
other purposes such as paying off credit-card debt?
If you have significant equity in your home, and you need to tap that equity to
pay off high interest, nondeductible debt, finance a child’s college education, pay
for necessary home renovations, or any other purpose you deem worthwhile, refi-
nancing may be your best option. However, refinancing isn’t the only option for
tapping into home equity.
Be careful not to use any money that you obtain through refinancing as a quick fix for a
systemic problem. If you are going to put your home at risk to pay off your credit cards,
do yourself a big favor and don’t let it happen again.
With the refinancing, you need to keep in mind that closing costs will be levied against
you. I feel it is safe to assume that somewhere between $1,200 and $1,500 is the typical
cost to refinance.
Worksheet 9-13 helps you determine whether refinancing is a good idea.
Worksheet 9-13
Should I Refinance?
If you plan to stay in the house for at least a few years beyond your break-even point
(for more on this topic, see the previous section “Determining Your Break-even Point”
in this chapter), you should probably refinance at this time. The process of shopping
for a new home mortgage to refinance an existing mortgage is exactly the same as the
process you went through to obtain your first mortgage. Please refer to earlier seg-
ments of this chapter for additional information regarding obtaining a mortgage.

P
roviding children with a college education is frequently a financial planning priority.
What was once deemed an option is now considered a requirement to succeed in the
job market today and in the future. Due to this fact, you may be feeling the pressure, or
choosing to bear the brunt of paying for your children’s college education, if you can.
You may be thinking that your kids are much too young to worry about their college educa-
tion. However, when your kids are very young, you have all kinds of options at your disposal.
If your children are older or in high school, the dilemma of how to help your kids pay for col-
lege may be your primary financial concern. In this chapter, I lay out the saving-for-college
options for parents of both younger and older children.

A person’s ability to earn an income is likely his most significant financial asset. A college
education plays a major role in the amount of money earned throughout a lifetime. People
with a bachelor’s degree or higher earn on average over two times more than those with a

The cost of a college education today can easily equal the price of a median family home, but
the payments are due and payable over only four years. The critical role of a college educa-
tion and the skyrocketing costs make planning for college costs essential.

Hopefully, Worksheet 10-1 is motivating enough that both you and your child recognize
the importance of obtaining a college education. Now the question is what type of col-
lege education may be appropriate for your child? The reason I want to start out with
discussing types of post-high school education is because the type of schooling greatly
affects the cost of the education. Average college costs range from about $2,200 per
year for a two-year community college to more than $22,000 per year for a four-year
private institution.
Here are your primary options:
 Vocational or technical school: The average cost for a one-year training program
at a public vocational or technical school is $3,000 to $5,000.
 Community college: Tuition and books at community (also known as junior) col-
leges average about $2,200 per year. More than 40 percent of students attending
community colleges receive grants and tax benefits that nearly pay for their edu-
cations. In fact, more then 60 percent of all full-time college students receive
grants to help offset the costs of their educations. The key word here is help!
 State university: The average annual expense for a four-year public university is
about $6,000.
 Private college or university: Private institutions cost about $22,000 per year on
average.
 Combination: If you’re looking for a way to reduce the total cost of your child’s
college education, but still enable him to attend the college of choice, one way to
keep the cost down is for him to attend community college before heading off to
the university. Your child can live at home and attend community college for the
first two years and then transfer to a university to earn a bachelor’s degree. The
diploma only shows from where someone graduated, not how he got there.
However, more than half of the students enrolled at four-year colleges attend institu-
tions that charge tuition and fees between $3,000 and $6,000 per year.
You (or your child) may have your heart set on him attending your alma mater or
a certain type of institution. However, in the grand scheme of things, the fact that
he obtains a college degree is much more significant than from where his degree is
granted. Another important fact to consider is that the overwhelming majority of
Americans aren’t working in the field that they studied in college. So, unless your
young scholar is at the top echelon of the academic scale, where he attends college
has little to do with his opportunities and earning potential in the future.
For now, presume that your child will be attending college — of some sort — and you
would like to help pay for her college costs. Essentially, a college education can be
paid for in one of four ways (or a combination of them):
 Save money in advance.
 Pay as you go.
 Borrow from federal student loan programs or private sources.
 Check to see whether your child qualifies for some sort of financial aid.
Throughout this section, I address these funding options and how and under what cir-
cumstances each approach may best apply.
134
Part III: Thinking about the Future 

Saving in advance
When you have young children, and/or significant surplus cash flow, saving for college
costs in advance may be your best option. For purposes of illustration, assume that
you want to have enough money available to pay for your newborn child to attend
community college for two years and then an in-state public university for two more
years (and after that she’s on her own). Also, for this example, don’t assume any finan-
cial aid — at least not yet.
The College Board (www.collegeboard.com) is a not-for-profit membership association
whose mission is to connect students to college success and opportunity. The College
Board is a very robust Web site where you can obtain the current costs for the two
institutions you’re considering: Johnson County Community College (JCCC) and the
University of Kansas (KU). While at JCCC, your student will live at home, so the only
expenses incurred are tuition, fees, books, and supplies. While attending KU, the stu-
dent will live on campus, and you must add the room-and-board expenses to the tuition,
fees, and so on. After doing the math, you can see in Worksheet 10-2 how much you
must now save on a monthly basis in order to have the money for your child to go to
college.
Worksheet 10-2
College Savings Calculation (Example)
Okay, so Worksheet 10-2 makes calculating how much you need to save for your one
newborn child a cinch. But what if you have three children, ages 11, 9, and 5? You
can work through this same calculation for each of your children and then add
the amounts together. Your monthly savings requirement in this example becomes
$848.16; go ahead and make it an even $900 a month. (A little cushion never hurt
anyone.)

Now it’s your turn. Use Worksheet 10-3 to calculate how much you need to save over
what period of time to have the money available to fund college expenses for each
child. You can go to www.collegeboard.com to find the most recent cost information
for colleges and universities across the United States.
No financial aid has been factored into the calculations in Worksheet 10-3. You can use
this worksheet to determine how much you need to save if you want to send your
child to college and not take into consideration financial aid. Heck, your child may not
qualify because you make so darn much money!
Worksheet 10-3
College Savings Calculation
You may have heard a lot about the costs of a college education inflating 4 to 8 percent
per year over the last 20 or 30 years. I haven’t included a separate adjustment to offset
the effects of inflation, nor have I accounted for any returns on your savings or invest-
ments for college. Based on historic inflation of college costs, I feel that it is appropri-
ate to presume that, at best, you achieve an after-tax return on your education funds
equal to the inflation rate. In other words, whatever earnings your college savings
accumulate after-tax will equal the increase in college costs.
Paying as you go
Do you think you’ll have enough income to cover your child’s college costs as she
incurs them? If so, you may consider paying as you go. Or you may find a combination

of savings and support from your current cash flow while your child is in college to be
your best strategy.
For example, say that you want to earmark $200 a month to go toward offsetting any
costs for your son’s college education. Your son Danny is currently 15 and plans
to start college in three years. So, your computation would go as follows: $200 times
36 months equals $7,200. When your teenager gets ready to attend college three years
from now, you will have accumulated enough money to pay for two years of tuition,
fees, books, and supplies at a community college or possibly one year of the same type
of expenses at an in-state public university.
Then, over the next four years while Danny is in college, you will accumulate, or possi-
bly write checks directly to your student or the college, another $9,600, which you pay
out of your current income. This strategy goes a long way toward paying for a big por-
tion of your child’s tuition and fees. Should you desire and find it financially appropriate
to more fully fund your child’s college education expenses, your next option is borrow-
ing (see later sections in this chapter on borrowing).
You can use Worksheet 10-4 to calculate how much savings you will be able to come
up with in advance and how much will be available from your cash flow while your
kids are in college. You may be able to make up for any remaining balance through
grants and loans in your child’s name. Refer to the “Checking into Financial Aid”
section later in this chapter for more information.

Chapter 10: Funding Your Kids’ College Education

Borrowing options for students and parents
After you’ve tapped out all other options, borrowing money to pay for college is your
last resort. Your student should exhaust her borrowing options before you consider
taking on any debt to pay for her college education.
The best way to fund college costs, if borrowing is necessary, is to have your child
borrow the money herself. Through federal student loan programs and financing pro-
grams available through various institutions, students have a number of attractive
options available to them to finance college costs.
Your child has many options as to how to go about obtaining a college education, such
as participating in work-study programs; doing part-time work; acquiring student
loans, grants and scholarships; attending college part-time while working full-time; or
joining AmeriCorps, the Peace Corps, or the military. In the section entitled “Checking
into Financial Aid,” I go into detail about each of the traditional financial aid options
that may be available to your student.
There is no such thing as financial aid for retirement! Putting yourself into debt to pay
for your child’s college education may have disastrous effects on your financial future.
I strongly recommend that your student apply for financial aid and exhaust all other
resources and options prior to your going into debt to pay for her college education.
With that said, if you borrow money for your child’s college education, I suggest you
consider the list of primary resources:
 Federal PLUS loan: This loan is the best of all these options. The Parent Loan for
Undergraduate Students (PLUS) is a popular, accessible, and reasonably priced
loan that parents (with decent credit) can access to borrow up to the full cost of
a dependent student’s education minus any other financial aid for which the stu-
dent qualifies. Repayment must begin within 60 days of receipt, and you may
have up to ten years to repay the loan plus interest. For additional information
visit www.collegeboard.com or call the College Board toll-free at 800-891-1253.
 Home equity line of credit: A home equity line of credit isn’t necessarily a bad
option, but it comes in a distant second to the Federal PLUS Loan. The interest
rate on the loan will be a lot higher, and borrowing against your home equity can
put your home at risk of foreclosure if you can’t pay the loan.
 401(k) plan loan: If your 401(k) plan has a loan feature, the maximum amount
you can borrow is the lesser of $50,000 or 50 percent of your vested account bal-
ance. Contact your 401(k) administrator for details.
Borrowing from your 401(k) plan can be hazardous to your wealth! By borrowing
money out of your 401(k) plan, that money is no longer invested, and although
you will repay yourself interest on this loan, the money is still coming out of your
other pocket. You aren’t getting the full benefit of your 401(k) plan investments
working for you. Also, the money you pull out of the 401(k) plan as a loan is pre-
tax dollars, but the money you repay the loan with is after-tax. So you actually
face a significant hidden cost in this borrowing strategy. Wham!
138
Part III: Thinking about the Future 

Another major negative to borrowing from your 401(k) plan is the possibility that
you may not continue with that employer while the loan is still outstanding. In
that event, you must repay the loan in full, or it will be considered a premature
distribution, subject to a 10-percent early-withdrawal penalty and taxation.
Double wham!
 Unsecured loan from your bank: Also known as a signature loan, this loan is
often the most expensive. The bank charges a much higher interest rate because
no asset, such as a house, is securing this loan. These loans are often difficult to
qualify for unless you have impeccable credit or are willing to pay an expensive
interest rate.
Using Worksheet 10-5, check the box in the left column if a particular source may be an
option to pay for your child’s college education, and if so, complete the available funds
in the column on the right.

Setting Payment Expectations
One of the most beneficial things you can do for your child is communicate the expec-
tations you have regarding paying for college and help your student set reasonable
expectations. You may feel very strongly that your child participate in the financial
responsibilities involved in obtaining this education. The cost of a college education
may come as a shock to your child, so the sooner you help establish appropriate
expectations, the better. Communicate expectations early and often.
One strategy that I think has a ton of merit is the collaborative agreement between
parent and child, shown in Worksheet 10-6.
139
Chapter 10: Funding Your Kids’ College Education

Worksheet 10-6
College Promissory Note (Example)
Benefits of the kind of collaborative arrangement you see in Worksheet 10-6 include
the following:
 Your child must apply himself and show a good faith effort, or you won’t pay
anything toward his college education.
 If your student drops out of school, he’s on his own.
 If your child applies himself and achieves a B average or better, you will repay
80 to 100 percent of the college costs.
 You don’t have to start repaying these loans until six months after your student
graduates, which allows you additional time to accumulate funds to repay the
debt or to adjust your monthly cash flow in order to be able to more comfortably
pay the debts.
Use Worksheet 10-7 to create your own promissory note.
As your parent, this is my pledge to you: If you attend college, apply for
financial aid in your own name, and raise any additional funds that may be
necessary to pay for the tuition, books, fees, and supplies, I will repay any
and all student loans that were required to fund your college education, under
the following schedule:

Thinking about Education Savings Vehicles
If you’ve not yet started a family, your children are young, or you have substantial sur-
plus cash flow, you should consider how best to save money to fund your children’s
college education fund. And I’m taking for granted that if you’re reading this section,
you want to have money available to pay for part of or all your child’s college costs, or
at least have funds available to lend to your child if needed.
Worksheet 10-3, earlier in this chapter, provided you the opportunity to calculate the
annual and monthly savings needed to fund a specific level of college costs. If you
haven’t already done this exercise, you want to do so before implementing any of
these college-savings strategies.
As your parent, this is my pledge to you: If you attend college, apply for

Chapter 10: Funding Your Kids’ College Education

Accumulating assets in your name has very little negative impact on your child’s abil-
ity to qualify for federal financial aid. However, should you decide to accumulate
money in your child’s name, approximately 35 percent of those assets will be deemed
available to pay for college costs, and financial aid will be reduced accordingly. So
keep most or all the money you save for your child’s college education in your own
name if you expect your scholar to qualify for financial aid.
Education Savings Accounts
If you’re within the income limits, you can contribute up to $2,000 per year to a Coverdell
Education Savings Account (ESA) for each child under the age of 18. Anyone with
income of less than $95,000 ($190,000 if married filing jointly) may contribute. If you
make too much money to contribute yourself, maybe that would be a great incentive for
Grandma to contribute. You can even gift the money to Grandma to contribute on behalf
of your child, if you are so inclined. Contributions aren’t tax-deductible; however, the
earnings grow tax-free and remain tax-free as long as they’re used to pay for qualified
education expenses.
You can open an ESA with a bank, mutual fund company, or any other financial institu-
tion that offers traditional IRA accounts. My first choice is investing with a low-cost,
no-load (no commission) mutual fund company, such as the following:
 Vanguard: The initial minimum investment to open an account is $2,000. However,
subsequent investments of as little as $100 can be made at any time, and from
anyone — hint, hint, Grandma! A very simple, maintenance-free investment option
is the Vanguard Target Retirement portfolio. You can select a Target portfolio
designed for the year your child is to start college. For more information about
Vanguard’s education savings account, visit www.vanguard.com.
 T. Rowe Price: Like Vanguard, T. Rowe Price also offers target date retirement
portfolios that can be excellent, low-cost, maintenance-free investment options
for your ESA account. Their initial minimum investment is $1,000. However, that
amount is reduced to $50 if you establish an automatic monthly savings program
and add at least $50 a month to the ESA account. Find out more about your
options at www.troweprice.com.
Education Savings Accounts are considered assets of the parent when determining
financial aid eligibility. However, there are a lot of benefits, such as tax-free earnings,
that should far outweigh the negative impact on financial aid qualification.
529 plans
Section 529 qualified tuition savings plans have evolved into one of the most attractive
college savings programs available today. Just like ESAs (see preceding section), 529
plan assets accumulate tax-free, and if your child uses them for qualified education
expenses, the withdrawals are tax-free, too.
The biggest difference between the ESA and 529 plans is the contribution limit. You
can invest up to $100,000 or more into a 529 plan, and you have no limitation based on
your income.
142
Part III: Thinking about the Future 

Another key difference is that 529 plans are state-sponsored programs. If your state
offers good 529 plans, and you invest in one, you may be able to deduct all or a portion
of your contributions on your state income tax return. Visit www.savingforcollege.
com for outstanding information and resources about all 529 plans, and pay particular
attention to the plans offered through your state.
Savingforcollege.com has a proprietary 5-Cap Rating system it uses to evaluate
and rate all 529 plans offered. The site also allows you to perform side-by-side com-
parisons of any 529 plans that you may be interested in, based on criteria that are
important to you.
529 Plans are considered assets of the parent when determining financial aid eligibility. 
UTMA/UGMA (Uniform Transfer to Minors /
Uniform Gifts to Minors)
With the other education savings plans available today, I find no use for UTMA/UGMA
accounts. With the 1986 tax law changes, the advantages of these accounts became
extremely minimal — too minimal, in my opinion, for parents to give up the control of
the assets — they have “gifted” the money to the child when opening the account.
These accounts are not tax-deferred or tax-free education savings plans, and they pale
in comparison to the Section 529 or Education Savings Accounts now available.
Series EE and I Savings Bonds
You can purchase up to $30,000 (face amount) of either Series EE or Series I Savings
Bonds per year. You can purchase savings bonds, which are issued by the U.S. govern-
ment, through local banks or through Treasury Direct (www.savingsbonds.gov) for
as little as $25. Savings bonds may appeal to you if you’re looking for a very low-risk
investment. The current yield on savings bonds is 3.4 percent per year.
You receive no tax deduction for making this investment; however, the interest on
these bonds is tax-free if the bonds are redeemed to pay for qualified education
expenses and your income doesn’t exceed the federal limitations in the year of
redemption.
Checking into Financial Aid
Before you decide to skip this section — say you’re presuming that your child won’t
qualify for financial aid — I encourage you to reconsider. Federal financial aid pro-
grams are intended to make up the difference between what your family can afford to
pay and what college costs, and is available to virtually everyone. However, you may
feel that your income or assets level is too high, and your child isn’t eligible for finan-
cial aid, but most Americans do qualify for financial aid in some way, shape, or form.
Who decides how much your family is able to pay? The amount you’re expected to be
able to pay is referred to as the expected family contribution, or EFC. The federal gov-
ernment and college financial aid officers use needs-based formulas that analyze your
family’s financial circumstances.
143
Chapter 10: Funding Your Kids’ College Education

The federal guidelines not only take into account your income and assets, but also
consider the size of your family and the number of your family members in college.
Although your child may not qualify for grants (money that doesn’t have to be repaid)
or the most attractive financial aid possible, she likely will need to go through the
financial aid application process (submitting the Free Application for Federal Student
Aid [FAFSA] application) and be turned down before she can apply for other financing.
And you definitely will qualify for the Federal PLUS loan mentioned earlier in this chap-
ter, presuming your credit is okay.
To obtain an estimate of what your expected family contribution would be, visit
www.collegeboard.com and use its EFC calculator. Working through the College
Board’s EFC calculator only takes a few minutes, and it gives you valuable feedback
regarding what to anticipate as your EFC. You can then plan how to best cover that
amount by using one of the many funding options described in the section “Thinking
about Education Savings Vehicles,” earlier in this chapter. In order to complete this cal-
culation, you need all the documents in Worksheet 10-8.
Worksheet 10-8
Data You Need to Calculate EFC
❏Prior year tax returns for parents and student
❏Recent paycheck stubs for parents and student
❏Confirmation of any Social Security benefits received by parents or student
❏Statement illustrating balance in Medical Spending Account of parents
❏Statement illustrating any child support paid by parents
❏Amount of any work-study earnings or financial aid received by student
❏List of medical and dental expenses for the preceding year
❏Bank account statements for both parents and student
❏Listing of assets owned (in the name of) student’s siblings
❏Fair market value of parent’s residence less outstanding mortgage(s)
❏Listing of other real estate and investments owned by parents or student (exclud-
ing assets in qualified retirement plans, annuities, and life insurance)
❏Fair market value of equity in any business owned by parents or student
❏Fair market value of equity in farm owned by parents or student
❏Value of any assets held in trust for student
After calculating your EFC, you may want to take a look at your options regarding fed-
eral student loans. With all loans, one of the primary issues you need to consider is the
cost of the loan — specifically the interest and any loan acquisition fees. The least
expensive loan is generally the one with the lowest interest rate. With the federal stu-
dent aid programs, the cheapest loans are as follows:
 Perkins loans have the strictest needs-based requirements. A student may
borrow up to $4,000 per year. The current interest rate is 5 percent, and pay-
ments don’t commence until the student graduates.
144
Part III: Thinking about the Future 

 Subsidized Stafford loans are also needs-based loans. A student may borrow up
to $2,625 in the first year of undergraduate studies, $3,500 in year two, and
$5,500 in years three through five. As of the writing of this book, the interest rate
is 6.8 percent per year. However, the federal government actually pays the inter-
est due on the loan until the student is required to begin making payments six
months after graduation. The loan must be repaid over ten years.
 Unsubsidized Stafford loans are not needs-based loans. The amount that may be
borrowed is identical to the Subsidized Stafford loan program if the student is
your dependent. However, if your student is independent, he may borrow up to
$4,000 in each of the first two years of his undergraduate program and up to
$5,000 in years three through five. The interest rate on this type of loan is also
6.8 percent per year, as of the writing of this book. However, the federal govern-
ment doesn’t pay any of this interest on behalf of the student. Repayment begins
six months after graduation, and the loan must be repaid over ten years.
To get the most recent interest rates on student loans and detailed instructions about
how to obtain these loans, visit the College Board’s Web site at www.CollegeBoard.com.

Saving for Retirement
In This Chapter
 Determining what matters most in retirement
 Estimating how much money you’ll need
 Maximizing your retirement savings strategies
P
icturing yourself in retirement may be difficult at this time in your life. Retirement
may feel so many years away that you can’t even fathom the idea of ever being able
to retire. Or possibly you’re middle-aged and feel that retiring someday is completely impos-
sible. However, I doubt you’d be investing the time reading this chapter if you’d given up all
hope.
I’ve also met a lot of people who don’t resonate with the concept or word retirement. So, for
the sake of our conversation on this subject, I would like you to think of financial freedom
or financial independence as synonymous with the word retirement. Many people have
absolutely no desire to stop working. However, those same people are looking for financial
freedom and financial independence. They want to be able to choose what they do, when
they do it, and for how long. You may be one of these people.
Every financial situation that I’ve encountered can be improved with proper planning. I’m
confident that by working through this chapter, your sense of what you need to do to achieve
financial independence will become an empowering force in your life. Unfortunately, you
can’t find any financial aid for retirement. However, that doesn’t mean that you don’t have
substantial options. And fortunately, those options aren’t nearly as complex as federal finan-
cial aid programs (see Chapter 10). 
When it comes to retirement planning, you have the following four options:
 Spend less now and save more.
 Get better net, after-tax returns on your investments.
 Work longer.
 Die earlier (but that’s not really a planning strategy I can recommend!)

To some degree or another, you have influence over the first three variables. In this
chapter, I illustrate how these options impact your retirement objectives. For many
people, the most palatable retirement solution involves a combination of all three of
the variables mentioned.
Figuring Out What Matters Most 
in Your Retirement
The first step in retirement planning is to determine what matters most to you and
your spouse or partner, if applicable. In Chapter 4, you may have already done a great
deal of exploration and prioritization of your financial goals. However, in this section,
I focus exclusively on the subject of your retirement.
Spend a moment now, reflect on your lifestyle in retirement, and think about how it will
change from the lifestyle you enjoy today. Worksheet 11-1 is an example. As you
ponder the subject of retirement, ask yourself these questions and use Worksheet 11-2
to notate your reflections:
 What are you doing?
 Where are you living?
 What activities are you enjoying?
 How do you spend your time?

my bike to the market, spend time with friends, and possibly take up yoga and/or the piano.
I want to be able to travel to see my grandkids frequently.

As you reflected on your lifestyle in retirement, you likely listed a lot of issues that
involve money — maybe earning money and definitely spending money to support
your desired lifestyle in retirement. This information is necessary to determine how
much money you’ll need in retirement and how much you’ll need to save to achieve
financial independence.
Calculating How Much You’ll Need to Retire
If you’re wondering how much money you need to retire, the quick answer that most
financial advisors would tell you is 60 to 80 percent of your final working years’ income
to maintain your standard of living after retirement. That may or may not be represen-
tative of how you’d like to enjoy your retirement, but it’s a starting place.
Take a closer look at how your monthly budget will change in retirement. You need to
determine for yourself, based on what matters most to you (see preceding section),
just how much money you’ll need each month to have the retirement that you’ve
dreamed of.
Take a look at an example monthly retirement budget in Worksheet 11-3. This example
illustrates a monthly cash flow need in retirement of about 74 percent of this person’s
current budget.

What does this budget in Worksheet 11-3 tell you about this person’s lifestyle in
retirement? Consider the following observations:
 This person’s home is paid for at retirement, but the insurance and taxes don’t
go away.
 Health insurance that was once provided by the employer is now the retiree’s
responsibility. Ouch!
 The retiree has no need to pay for disability insurance after retiring because the
income she was insuring is gone.
 Cable and phone bills paid by the employer transfer to the retiree.
 Healthcare and prescription drug costs go up substantially; however gasoline,
commuting expenses, clothing, and dry cleaning costs drop significantly after
retirement.
 Dining out and school lunches go down, but vacations, traveling, entertainment,
and charitable contributions are up drastically.
 The retiree in this example does his own lawn and home care.
 By the time of retirement, no additional retirement savings are necessary, and
college savings are also funded.

Not only will the retiree in Worksheet 11-3 be able to sustain his standard of living in
retirement, but he will also have money to do the things that matter most to him.
However, be sure to note that this person currently has a mortgage payment and a
home equity line of credit (HELOC) and is saving $2,000 per month for retirement,
which is the primary reason for the reduced need in retirement.
Check out your retirement income needs as a percentage of your current cost of living

Thinking about Other Retirement Income
All your retirement income may not have to come from your savings alone, which I dis-
cuss in the next section. Do you have a company pension, did someone leave a bunch
of money in a trust fund for you, or are you eligible for and planning to receive Social
Security? If so, you need to factor in this additional income as well as the income that
can be produced off of your current retirement savings.
Social Security represents only about 40 percent of the average retiree’s income needs.
And most observers feel that something drastic must occur now, or the Social Security
system will be broke in 20 to 40 years. Tack on 20 to 40 years to your current age. Are
you still going to be around and depending on Social Security when you’re least able to
be without it? Also, very few people now have old-fashioned defined-benefit pension
plans. The responsibility of providing for your retirement is mostly or entirely up to you.
For my planning purposes, I assume that people under age 40 won’t receive any Social
Security retirement benefits. For people between the ages of 40 and 60, I feel that it is
appropriate to discount the amount of Social Security benefits that they’re expecting
to receive by 50 percent. I also project life expectancy to age 100 minimum. Hopefully,
I’m being extremely prudent with my estimates, but the last thing I want is for you to
wake up broke.
Worksheet 11-6 helps you estimate the Social Security retirement benefit you’re pro-
jected to receive. Find your current annual earnings in the left column and then the
monthly projected benefit based on your year of birth. Keep in mind that you likely
should reduce the estimated amount or completely ignore Social Security in your
retirement planning.

Chapter 11: Saving for Retirement

Determining Your Savings Requirements
After you determine how much income you need on a monthly basis in retirement, you
can determine how much money you need to save to pull this off. Like it or not, you’re
responsible for accumulating all or the majority of the money needed to support your-
self in retirement. Most people aren’t saving nearly enough — and you may be one of
these people. Nearly 50 percent of all workers saving for retirement have accumulated
less than $25,000. Something has got to give. Either you need to increase your saving
substantially or work longer (maybe both!). You can have the most impact on your
retirement finances by adjusting these two variables.
Worksheet 11-7 provides the computation to help you determine how much money
you need to accumulate to provide for your living expenses in retirement. Refer to
Worksheet 11-8 for factors needed in this computation.

Explanation: The indicated retirement benefits are at the worker’s normal
retirement age (gradually increasing to age 67 by 2022).
Calculations reflect the midpoint of the indicated range. For example, the $1,497
monthly retirement benefit (right column under 1956-60 heading) is based upon
$46,500 of Current Annual Earnings (midpoint of 43,000 - $50,000) and a 1958 Year
Of Birth (midpoint of 1956-60). The underlying AIME assumptions used to
calculate these retirement benefits (the PIAs) are based upon the AIMEs set
forth in the 2007 National Underwriter Social Security Slide-O-Scope & Planner.
These AIME amounts are approximate and are based upon the assumption that
the worker has had 6% pay raises each year through 2007.

Part III: Thinking about the Future 

Worksheet 11-7
How Much Money Do I Need to Retire?
Estimate your final salary by multiplying your current salary by the
inflation factor in Worksheet 11-8 based on the number of years you have
until retirement. For example,  if you’re currently making $50,000 per year
and plan to retire in 20 years, your formula is $50,000 × 1.81 = $90,500. In
other words, by the time you retire, it will take over $90,000 to buy what
$50,000 does today because of inflation.
Current Salary $  
× (inflation factor) 
   = 
Final Annual Salary
Multiply this Final Annual Salary number times the percentage of your
current income you determined in Worksheet 11-4 that you will need in
retirement.
If, for example, your final salary computed to be $90,500, and the current
income percentage you determined in Worksheet 11-4 was 74 percent
($90,500 × 0.74), you need $66,970. You can go ahead and round that number
out to $67,000 per year needed in retirement.
Final Annual Salary $ 
 
 × (percentage) 
              = 
Annual Income Needed in Retirement
Reduce the Annual Retirement Income number you determined in Step 2
by the amount you will receive from guaranteed sources, such as
company pension, Veteran’s pension, Social Security, an immediate
annuity, and so on.
Refer to Figure 11-6 for an estimate of your Social Security benefit if you
don’t happen to have a recent Benefit Estimate Statement from the Social
Security Administration. If you do, use those numbers instead.
Presume for this example that you will receive $1,800 a month in guaranteed
income.  You need $67,000 per year in income. However, Social
Security should provide $21,600 of the total income you need, leaving a
balance of $45,400 per year to be covered by savings.
Total Retirement Income Needed $  
, less guaranteed income of
$ 
      equals $ 
          per year.
Calculate the amount that you’ll need from your savings by multiplying
your net retirement income need in Step 3 by 20.
Example: $45,400 net retirement income need × 20 = $908,000.
Net retirement income need $ 
 
 × 20 = $
Take into account your current savings for retirement by multiplying
the balance in your retirement account by the growth factor illustrated
in Worksheet 11-8; this number is what your retirement nest egg should
be worth at your target retirement date.
For example, if your current savings for retirement is $115,000 × growth
factor of 3.87, $445,050 is available at retirement from growth on current
savings.
Current savings for retirement $ 
 
 × (growth factor) 
 =
$ 
           available at retirement

Discovering the Best Ways for You to Save
for Retirement
You can use many options to save for retirement. However, these vehicles aren’t cre-
ated equal. The following is a listing of my preferred retirement savings vehicles and
the order in which I recommend you fund these options. Should you fulfill your savings
requirement before you reach the end of the list, wonderful!
1. Make use of your 401(k) or 403(b) plans.
If you have a 401(k) or 403 (b) plan through your employer and your employer
provides a matching contribution, I suggest that you first fund this account up to
If your result in Step 5 is less than the result in Step 4, you need to save
more to achieve your retirement income objective. Continue on to
Step 7. Otherwise, you just keep on saving your current amount!
Subtract your result from Step 5 from your result in Step 4 to determine
the remaining capital you need.
Example: $908,000 minus $445,050 = $462,950 additional retirement funds
needed.
Result from Step 4 $ 
          minus result from Step 5 $
equals $  
   , which is the additional amount you need to accumulate
between now and your retirement date to achieve your objective.
Divide your required additional funds (from Step 7) by the multiplier in
Worksheet 11-8 to determine the approximate amount of money you
need to save each and every year to achieve your retirement objective.
Example: $462,950 divided by 41.00 = $11,291 required annual retirement
savings
Additional funds needs $  
     divided by (multiplier factor)
 
     = $ 
 
     requirement annual retirement savings.

Part III: Thinking about the Future 

the limits of the matching contribution. For example, say that your employer
matches 50 cents on every dollar that you contribute to your 401(k), up to 
6 percent of your annual salary. Your salary of $50,000 x 0.06 (amount matched)
equals an annual contribution of $3,000; plus, you’ll receive another $1,500 from
your employer matching contribution, giving you a total of $4,500 per year.
By participating in your qualified retirement plan at work and receiving a match-
ing contribution from your employer, you’re receiving a guaranteed rate of return
of no less than 50 percent per year.
Based on the annual saving requirement of $7,687, which I calculate in the exam-
ple in Worksheet 11-7, you still need to save an additional $3,187 per year for
retirement.
2. Check into a Roth IRA.
The Roth IRA is one of the most underappreciated and underused retirement
vehicles available today. Everyone who qualifies to make a Roth IRA contribution
and still needs to save for retirement should do so by utilizing a Roth.
To qualify to make a Roth IRA contribution, individual taxpayers must have an
adjusted gross income of less than $99,000 per year. That number increases to
$156,000 per year for taxpayers filing jointly.
You receive no tax deduction by contributing to a Roth IRA account; however,
all earnings accumulate on a tax-deferred basis, and all withdrawals taken out
during retirement are tax-free. You never have to pay tax on the earnings in this
account.
For example, if you currently make $50,000 per year, you are eligible to make a
Roth IRA contribution. The maximum amount you can contribute to a Roth IRA
account for 2007 is $4,000 if you’re under 50 years of age and $5,000 if you’re 50
or above. Regardless of your age, you should be able to fully fund your retire-
ment savings requirement by contributing up to the matching amount in your
401(k) plan and making up the balance of your required contribution into a Roth
IRA account.
3. If you still need to save additional funds for your retirement, and you have
money left over to save, consider the following options, depending on your
individual circumstances:
• Option A: If you haven’t yet built up a personal portfolio in your own
name, invest in low-cost, tax-efficient vehicles such as no-load index mutual
funds or exchange-traded funds (more on the specifics of these vehicles in
Chapter 14). I strongly encourage you to consider accumulating money in
your own name utilizing these tax-efficient options.
• Option B: If you already have accumulated a fairly reasonable personal
portfolio and feel comfortable that you have enough accessible funds in the
case of an emergency, I suggest that you continue to fund your 401(k) or
403(b) plan beyond the matching contribution to fulfill the amount needed
to fully fund your retirement savings.
If you happen to be one of those extremely rare individuals who has already
maxed out your contribution limits to your 401(k) plan and the Roth IRA, if eligi-
ble, the next best place for your money, in my opinion, is in your personal portfo-
lio. You want to invest this money in the most low-cost and tax-efficient manner.
I explain how to achieve these investment objectives in Chapter 14.
Utilize Worksheet 11-9 to help you allocate your annual required retirement savings
contribution among the best retirement investment vehicles available to you today.

advantage of the matching contribution.  
 
 
 
 
     $
Subtract line 2 from line 1 and enter the result here.       $
If line 3 illustrates that you still need to save additional money for
retirement, subtract that amount from the amount you’re eligible to
contribute to a Roth IRA account. Here’s how you do it:
Beginning with your result from line 3 $ 
 
    , subtract the
maximum Roth IRA contribution that you’re eligible to contribute this year
($4,000 under 50 or $5,000 for 50 and over) $ 
 
.
If the result is a positive number, you should invest that amount into tax-
efficient vehicles within your personal portfolio or add to your 401(k) plan
up to the maximum contribution limit. If you still need to make additional
retirement savings contributions, I recommend that you consider additional
tax-efficient vehicles within your personal portfolio.

In This Chapter
 Quantifying your gross estate
 Factoring in estate taxes
 Exploring your legacy and personal goals
 Determining the best estate-planning options
You may think that you don’t care what happens after you’re gone. But what about the
family, friends, and stuff you leave behind? Do you care if the most important person in
your life receives anything you may have of value, or are you okay with having the state
decide how to divvy up your stuff? Who’s going to go through your underwear drawer? Who
will care for your beloved cat or, more importantly, your dependent children?
Estate planning is all about what you want to have happen to you, your dependents, and your
stuff when you’re gone. Estate planning also covers what happens if you’re alive, but can’t
make decisions for yourself.
In this chapter, I show you why estate planning is so important and outline strategies you
can implement to make certain that your needs are met and your wishes are carried out in
the event of your death or incapacity.
I’m not an estate-planning attorney. The information and suggestions provided in this chap-
ter are for your education and empowerment. I encourage you to consult with a qualified
estate-planning attorney to make certain that your wishes will be carried out in the manner
that would be most efficient and effective for your goals.
For a more detailed discussion, check out Estate Planning For Dummies (Wiley) by N. Brian
Caverly and Jordan S. Simon.
Calculating Your Gross Estate
The first thing you need to do when planning your estate is to calculate your gross estate.
Then you can employ different estate planning strategies based on the size and composition
of your estate. If you already completed Worksheet 2-3 in Chapter 2, enter your Net Worth
total in Step 1. Otherwise, determine your gross estate by flipping over to Chapter 2 and
completing Worksheet 2-3; then you can return to this chapter and finish the exercise in
Worksheet 12-1.

The number you came up with for your gross estate is probably a bigger number than
you were expecting. That number represents, for most people, the stuff you need to
figure out what to do with, and your estate plan tells the world what you want to
happen to your stuff when you die.
Thinking about Estate Taxes
You may be one of the few people whose estate would have to pay federal gift or estate
taxes, meaning that some of the “stuff” listed in the preceding section may end up
going to Uncle Sam. How do you know if you’re in that situation?
Worksheet 12-2 lists the amount of an estate that you can die with and not have to pay
taxes. Remember that the figures listed in Worksheet 12-2 are accurate at the time this
book is printed, but are subject to change. For the most up-to-date tax rates and
exemption amounts, visit www.IRS.gov or contact an estate-planning attorney.
If your gross taxable estate happens to be less than the exemption amount for the cur-
rent year or if you’re married and plan to leave everything or all but the exemption
amount to your spouse, no estate tax would be due. The same thing is true if you leave
these assets to a qualifying charity.

Husbands and wives can transfer assets to each other during life and at death. You
have no limits or taxes on this transfer. For example, if you marry or remarry a person
who owns a home in his or her name individually, that home can be retitled into joint
ownership. Your spouse would legally be giving you one half of the value of the home.
No gift or estate transfer tax would be due because this transfer is made between a
married couple.
If you transfer assets to anyone other than your spouse or if you don’t have a spouse,
those transfers are subject not only to estate taxation, but potentially state inheritance
taxation as well. To avoid taxes on your estate, you could pass all or enough of your
assets to a qualifying charity. (Enough would be any amount of assets over the exemp-
tion amount listed on the following worksheet.) If you find yourself in this situation,
you have wonderful planning opportunities available to you, and I suggest that you
consult with a qualified estate-planning attorney immediately if you don’t have a cur-
rent estate plan in place.

Identifying Your Legacy Goals 
and Personal Desires
If you worked through the previous sections, you likely discovered that you actually
do have something of value that you would like to leave to people or causes that you
feel strongly about. You have many different ways that you can go about making this
happen (see the next section). In this section, I want you to focus on who or what
causes you would like to provide some consideration for in the event of your death.
To get a better idea of what I’m talking about, take this example into consideration:
Tom is currently not married and doesn’t have any children. His parents are okay
financially; however, his three siblings aren’t as comfortable. Tom would like to leave
some money to his siblings and also to one of his nieces. He doesn’t have any desire to
leave them a large windfall, but he would like to leave them something. Tom is thinking
about giving $25,000 to each of his siblings and $10,000 to his niece to help her pay for
college. He’d also like to leave $5,000 each to his two best friends. Whatever money is
left over he’d like to go to the charitable organization, Operation Wildlife.
Worksheet 12-3 gives you the opportunity to think about and list who or what organi-
zations you would like to leave your legacy. List names of people or organizations who
you would like to receive a gift or inheritance upon your death. Also, include dollar
amounts or percentages of your estate with the name of each recipient. In the event
that you have any special requests or restrictions, also indicate those details. The
information you provide in Worksheet 12-3 is essential to determining how best to
implement your estate plan and fulfill your personal objectives.

Figuring Out the Best Estate Planning
Options for You
Estate planning provides not only for the efficient and effective transfer of assets at
your death, but also for the instructions regarding the management of your financial
affairs and the making of healthcare decisions if you’re unable to do so for yourself.
The most common techniques employed by people to transfer assets upon their death
are titling assets as
 Joint tenants with right of survivorship: Most average Americans own a home
with their spouse, and the house is registered in joint tenancy with right of
survivorship. They may also own personal investments, such as brokerage
or mutual fund accounts titled with their spouse as joint tenants with rights of
survivorship. This ownership type allows you to co-own assets with another
person, and upon the first death, 100 percent of the asset transfers to the co-
owner automatically, avoiding probate.
 Beneficiary designations: You may have a retirement plan at work, life insurance,
and possibly an IRA account or two, all of which have beneficiary designations.
A beneficiary designation instructs the retirement plan sponsor, investment
account custodian, or the insurance company as to who is to receive the assets
upon your death. Assets and insurance policies with beneficiary designations also
avoid probate.
164
Part III: Thinking about the Future 

 A will: A will is a legal document that allows you to dictate in writing what you
want to happen with your assets and who will care for your dependents upon
your death. You can obtain a will from an attorney who specializes in estate 
planning, with off-the-shelf software programs, or from online resources like
http://Nolo.com. A will becomes effective through the probate court process.
All assets that transfer by title or beneficiary designation upon death avoid probate.
Probate is the legal process of settling an estate. However, it can be expensive and
time-consuming. You can reduce probate fees and potentially save time by having as
many assets as possible pass to your heirs through joint tenancy with rights of sur-
vivorship and by using beneficiary designations as much as possible. All other assets
that don’t transfer by title or beneficiary designation, such as personal property, vehi-
cles, and your baseball card collection, need to be addressed in your will.
Worksheet 12-4 outlines the basic asset transfer techniques and options, including the
most common ones.

In my opinion, the most critical (but not the only) reason why you need a will is to
name the guardians for your minor children, presuming that you have minor children.
Not only do you want to consider who should be the caretakers of your children while
they are minors, but also, who should take care of the money for your children until
they reach adulthood? You don’t want to leave this issue for the state to determine.
Many people die without having executed a will. (Executing a will is the official term for
having a written will properly signed, witnessed, and notarized.) In that case, your
state of residence dictates how your assets will be distributed and who would be
responsible for caring for your minor children. I think it’s safe to assume that your
desires will be different than what your state law would dictate. Don’t take chances,
especially with minor children. If you don’t have a will, get one immediately!
I often find that the best caregivers aren’t necessarily the best money managers, so I
encourage you to consider who would be the best caregivers and who would be the
best money managers for the assets you leave in trust to your children. The first part
of Worksheet 12-5 provides you an opportunity to list the individuals that you would
like to consider as primary caregivers for your children, if you (and your spouse, if
applicable) are gone. The second part of Worksheet 12-5 asks you to consider who you
would like to care for your children’s money.

You may be wondering why I’ve provided three different choices for each caregiver
and money manager. The reason is simple! Circumstances can change, and your first
choice may no longer be qualified per your requests in your will, or they may be
unwilling or unable to serve.
166
Part III: Thinking about the Future 

For example, imagine you die while your children are still in school. Your first choice
of caregiver may be your sister; however, she lives halfway across the country. Upon
your death, your children would not only be traumatized by the loss of their parent,
but also be faced with having to re-establish themselves in a new home, with new
friends and a new school. Maybe keeping your children in the same town or neighbor-
hood where you currently live is very important to you, so you may choose to desig-
nate another family member or close friend as guardian.
Using beneficiary designations
You may be able to accomplish your asset-transfer objectives very simply through the
proper use of beneficiary designations. You’re likely familiar with beneficiary designa-
tions on life insurance policies, 401(k) plan assets, and IRA accounts, but you may not
be aware that you can designate beneficiaries on other types of assets as well.
You may establish a transfer on death (TOD) or payable on death (POD) beneficiary
designation on your bank accounts. This same type of beneficiary designation is also
available with many brokerage accounts. Contact your brokerage company to estab-
lish a beneficiary designation on your personal account.
In a few states, you can have a beneficiary designation on your personal property and
real estate. Contact your county’s registrar of deeds office to find out whether this
option is allowable and to figure out the process to register your beneficiary designa-
tion on personal property and real estate.
If you own assets titled joint tenants with right of survivorship, that account already
has the equivalent of a beneficiary designation. Your joint owner will inherit 100 percent
of the asset balance upon your death automatically. 
Assets that transfer to your heirs automatically upon your death aren’t subject to the
terms of your will. The ownership of the account (joint tenants with right of survivor-
ship) or the beneficiary designation takes precedence over your will. Those assets will
be transferred directly to recipients without going through a long, tedious, and expen-
sive probate process. Your will actually doesn’t become effective until it has been
entered into probate. The probate process typically takes 9 to 24 months to complete.
By structuring your assets to minimize the number of items and total dollar value
of assets that have to go through probate, you will save your executor (the one who
you assign in your will to do this time-consuming, thankless job) a lot of time and your
estate a lot of money.
Titling property joint tenants with right of survivorship and establishing beneficiary
designations are the two most common probate-avoidance techniques. The third is a
revocable living trust.
Considering a living trust
A living trust is a legal document created by you (the grantor) during your lifetime. Just
as a will does, it spells out exactly what your desires are with regard to your assets,
your dependents, and your heirs. The big difference is that a will only becomes effec-
tive after you die and your will has been entered into probate. A living trust bypasses
167
Chapter 12: Thinking about When You’re Gone: Estate Planning

the costly and time-consuming process of probate enabling your successor trustee (who
fills basically the same role as an executor of a will) to carry out your instructions as
documented in your living trust at your death, and also if you’re unable to manage
your financial, healthcare, and legal affairs due to incapacity.
Living trusts are available from estate planning attorneys, off-the-shelf software
programs, and online resources, such as my suggestion for the do-it-yourselfer,
http://Nolo.com.
A living trust is most appropriate for individuals who have complex financial or per-
sonal circumstances, such as substantial assets, a blended family, closely held busi-
ness interests, or property in other states. If you have a complex situation or are
uncomfortable trusting your personal knowledge and judgment with such important
issues, I strongly recommend that you hire a qualified estate-planning attorney to draft
this document. Yes, you’ll spend more money, but you can rest assured knowing that
your wishes will be carried out exactly as you desire.
A living trust can also be a very effective tool for an unmarried individual, regardless
of financial situation, presuming that the individual’s desires can’t be fulfilled by utiliz-
ing beneficiary designations and the joint with rights of survivorship titling option and
powers of attorney.
The two types of living trusts are as follows:
 Revocable living trust: With a revocable living trust, you transfer your assets
into the ownership of the trust. You retain control of those assets as the trustee
of your revocable living trust. You can change or revoke the trust at any time you
want. The assets in the trust pass directly to your beneficiaries without going
through probate upon your death. However, neither wills nor revocable living
trusts avoid or minimize estate taxes. (For ways on how to avoid or minimize
estate taxes, see the next item and section “Thinking about Estate Taxes,” earlier
in this chapter.)
 Irrevocable living trust: An irrevocable trust allows you to permanently and
irrevocably give away your assets during your lifetime. After you give away these
assets, you have relinquished all control and interest in these assets. Due to that
fact, these assets are no longer considered part of your estate and aren’t subject
to estate taxes. As you likely imagine, an irrevocable trust is appropriate in only
extremely rare circumstances, such as when you have more money than you or
your spouse could ever use. Your beneficiaries would benefit at Uncle Sam’s
expense if you utilized an irrevocable trust to reduce your taxable estate before
your death.
Living trusts (revocable or irrevocable) typically cost $1,000 to $3,000 per person.
Getting other important documents in order
Even with all your assets properly titled, your beneficiary designations in order, and a
will or revocable living trust in place (see previous sections), you still have a few very
important issues to take care of and documents to execute. For most people, the odds
of becoming incapacitated are actually much higher than those of dying prematurely.
You need some ancillary documents that address incapacity with regard to financial
and medical decisions:
168
Part III: Thinking about the Future 

 Financial power of attorney: A financial power of attorney is a legal document
that you need to complete your estate planning. This document generally should
be drafted for you by a licensed attorney who specializes in estate planning.
However, software programs are available, and you can find online providers of
these documents as well. My preferred resource, if you don’t use a qualified
estate planning attorney, is the nation’s premier legal resource for the do-it-
yourselfer, http://Nolo.com.
This document enables you to appoint someone to make financial decisions and
manage your financial affairs in the event that you can’t make these decisions
for yourself. I encourage you to not only select one individual as your financial
power of attorney, but also select at least one successor, should your initial
selection be unwilling or unable to perform these services.
 Living will: A living will spells out under what circumstances, if any, you want
your life prolonged if you have no reasonable chance for recovery. This docu-
ment is also available through estate-planning attorneys, Web sites such as
http://Nolo.com, and from your local hospital. Keep in mind the forms avail-
able through the hospital are going to be very generic and likely not address
some specific details that you may feel strongly about. At least with the forms
from Nolo, you can tailor this document to your circumstances as best as you
know how.
 Durable power of attorney for healthcare: This document is also part of a com-
prehensive estate planning package provided by any qualified estate planning
attorney. You can able obtain this document from http://Nolo.com, or use the
Five Wishes Brochure available through www.AgingWithDignity.org.
This document enables you to name a person, or possibly a couple of people, to
make healthcare decisions if you’re unable to make them for yourself.
 Funeral instructions: On a final note (no pun intended), I encourage you to write a
letter spelling out your desires regarding your funeral arrangements. Rather than
having your grieving loved ones wonder what you would have wanted, give them
the gift of knowing your wishes in advance. Also be sure to tell them whether you
have any prearranged or prepaid funeral plans and, if so, with whom. It’ll help
them out and likely save your estate a lot of money.
Unfortunately, funeral directors and their sales staff have been known to be very
skillful in taking advantage of grieving people for their own financial gain. For
example, if you don’t specifically tell your family that you want them to keep
your funeral service and burial services very modest, your heirs may follow the
guidance of a skillful salesperson and spend thousands of dollars on stuff you
never would have wanted.

hether you have a substantial investment portfolio or haven’t started investing yet,
this chapter is for you. I cover the fundamental building blocks of an investment
portfolio, addressing characteristics of primary asset classes, and help you explore in depth
your tolerance for risk. Some asset classes, as well as a portfolio allocation, may be appro-
priate for you, but not for another investor, due to your personal objectives, your time hori-
zon, and your tolerance for risk.
Evaluating Needs and Options 
for Cash Reserves
The concept of having money that you can get your hands on in a very short period of time
so that you can cover several months’ worth of your living expenses, if necessary, is a smart
risk management and financial planning concept.
You never know when a catastrophe may strike. A catastrophe affects many aspects of our
lives, both personally and financially. In nearly every event, money is part of the solution —
sometimes the only solution. Imagine how losing your job or having a new job fall through,
not being able to sell your house, having a major medical bill, or having a sick child or pet
would impact your financial life. The purpose of having access to money at very short notice
is to protect you as best as reasonably possible from risks that you can’t afford to bear.
(I talk more about managing risk in Chapter 15.)
Worksheet 13-1 provides a listing of the common and not-so-common sources of cash
reserves that you could consider in the event of an emergency. Check the box at the left
if that resource applies to you and then enter the approximate dollar amount accessible.
Also note in the right-hand column how quickly those funds could be available to you.

If you don’t have any income and you try to obtain a home equity line of credit, you likely won’t qualify.
**Significant fee, penalty, or potentially very inopportune time to borrow or sell.
The exercise in Worksheet 13-1 helps you explore all traditional avenues for raising
cash. The total sum represents how much money would be accessible to you in the
event of an emergency.
Now, refer to Worksheet 3-3. If you haven’t had the opportunity to go through this
worksheet, either do so now or give it your best guestimate. If you have already com-
pleted this exercise, list your actual total monthly expenses. Then divide that amount
by the total cash you could raise, from all reliable sources at the same time, to reveal
approximately how many months’ worth of living expenses you can cover in the event
of a catastrophe. How many months can you go without an income?
If you don’t have six months or more coverage, you need to build up cash reserves in
the types of accounts that are accessible within a short period of time, with little or no
cost to access the funds.
You may also discover that most of the money you can get your hands on would cost
you substantially more than you’re comfortable paying or would potentially be very
risky, and therefore, you decide that you need more money in safe, immediately avail-
able accounts.
You can’t find one “right” answer for everybody. If you’ve worked for the federal gov-
ernment for 20 years, your income is considerably more predictable than a real estate
agent’s or a carpenter’s income. The stability of your job, your income, your health, as
well as your tolerance for risk, must all be taken into account to determine the “right”
amount you should have in cash reserves. If in doubt, play it safe!
174
Part IV: Building and Managing Wealth 

Discovering Your Tolerance for Risk
Determining risk tolerance is much more of an art than a science. When you think of
risk in your investment portfolio, you may think of volatility (how much your invest-
ments go up and down). Most people do. However, risk is more accurately defined as
the probability that you won’t achieve your personal or financial objectives (which I
discuss in Chapter 4).
Worksheet 13-2 contains a series of questions designed to help you identify just how
much risk you’re willing and able to take in order to achieve your objectives. Answer
the questions and then reflect on your responses. What do they tell you about the
amount of risk you can tolerate for any amount of time? If you aren’t sure how to
answer a particular question, check out Worksheet 13-3, which lists observations and
potential conclusions that correspond to the eight risk tolerance questions, so that
you can gauge or evaluate your answers.

1.
How would you define yourself as an investor?
a. Babe Ruth was the all-time home run hitter in baseball, but at the same time, he carried the
record for strike-outs. An investor who identifies with a swingin’-for-the-fences mentality is likely
a Babe Ruth–type of investor. When you’re on, you’re really on, but when you’re off, you’re off
the charts. You have a stomach for volatility and the faith that in the grand scheme of things
you’ll do much better than the base-hitter type. If luck and talent are with you, you can make
money as this type of investor.
b. The base-hitter investor type isn’t swingin’ for the fences. She’s looking for solid, consistent per-
formance. This type of investor knows she’ll sacrifice ever knowing what it feels like to hit a
home run, but is willing to because she believes that slow and steady wins the race, which is
true in the investment world.
Consistent, positive growth is the most probable way to achieve financial security. You sure
don’t get bragging rights very often (well, at least not for many, many years), but in the end, you
usually come out just right.
c. Switch-hitters match their talent against their opponents’. If the pitcher does worse against a
left-handed batter, then the switch-hitter may opt to bat left-handed. An investor who identifies
with this characteristic may have difficulty staying with one investment strategy. He may always
be on the lookout for a “better way.”
d. An investor who identifies with the character who has “never held a bat” has very little or no
investment experience. Yet!

2.
What amount of your portfolio could you tolerate losing in any given month?
It is not uncommon for the U.S. stock market, as a whole, to drop 10 percent in value in just 
one month. One individual stock, or the stock market of some countries, loses that much any
given day.
If you’re fully invested in stocks, you need to be prepared for down days, months, and even years.
The more you diversify your stock portfolio the better, but only so much risk can be diversified
away. You cannot diversify away all volatility, and at times that volatility can be great.
3.
What amount of your portfolio could you tolerate losing in any given year?
Dropping 10 percent in value in just one year isn’t at all uncommon for the U.S. stock market. In
fact, the stock market commonly goes up or down as much as 1 or 2 percent per day. Too many
bad days in a row totals a very bad period.
4.
How much could you tolerate losing over five years?
The U.S. stock market has had only one negative five-year period of time in the last 35 years.
However, for the most part, these five-year periods were actually some really good years for the
U.S. stock market. It hasn’t been that positive before, so don’t count on it in the future.
Prepare yourself and your investment portfolio for extended down markets. Five years isn’t a long
time to the stock market. However, when you’re living through it, a bad year period feels like an
eternity.
5.
How much money could you handle losing in any given year?
You shouldn’t have any money invested in any stocks if you can’t tolerate some chance of loss over
an extended period of time. One year isn’t long enough to put your money at risk and come out
ahead every time.
6.
What action would you take if the stock market dropped 25 percent from its present value
next week?
Knowing what the “right” answer would be is difficult because the U.S. stock market hasn’t lost 25
percent in a week very often. You may not really see this as a legitimate risk; however, a 25-percent
drop is extremely likely to occur again and possibly several times during your investing lifetime.
The best response to a drastic drop in the stock market historically has been to raise cash and
invest more, but not every time. Sometimes doing nothing is the smarter immediate reaction.
Selling everything has historically not been the “right” thing to do.
7.
How many years of your financial independence or security are you willing to risk?
Human beings are naturally risk averse. We don’t like to lose, and the pain of losing is more moti-
vating than the pleasure we receive from gains. So how do you know how much financial freedom
you’re willing to risk?
Say, for example, that you need $50,000 per year in retirement income to support your standard
of living. Your portfolio is currently $500,000. Are you willing to risk losing 10 percent of your
portfolio, or $50,000, if it meant you would have to work one additional year?
This question is just another way to look at your tolerance for risk. The closer you are to achieving
your financial objectives, the more the definition of risk as “not being able to achieve your objec-
tive” becomes real. Does your response to this question change the way you responded to previ-
ous questions?
177
Chapter 13: Evaluating Your Current Portfolio

8.
Regarding your finances, what do you spend the most time thinking about?
a. Are you questioning whether you’ll have enough money for the future? Wondering whether
you’re saving enough? Remember that you’ll need a substantial amount of capital to provide the
income you may need to retire. You can use the following table to get a ballpark estimate of how
much money you’ll need at retirement.
Income Needed
Capital Needed
$1,000/month
$300,000
$2,000/month
$600,000
$3,000/month
$900,000
$4,000/month
$1,200,000
For each $1,000 in retirement income you need by age 65, you need to save this amount per month,
presuming that you haven’t begun saving for retirement in any meaningful way. (For additional
information on retirement planning, refer to Chapter 11.)

Worksheet 13-2 and the observations and conclusions illustrated in Worksheet 13-3
attempt to isolate your tolerance for risk. However, risk tolerance can’t adequately be
measured with a brief questionnaire alone. I encourage you to reflect on the following
questions as well:
 If you’re currently investing in the stock market, how did you feel during
recent periods of market fluctuations?
 How is your money currently invested?
 What is your comfort level with managing your own portfolio?
You should take all of these issues into consideration to determine your investment
risk tolerance.
To arrive at the appropriate asset allocation, take into account your tolerance for risk,
your investment time horizon, and your financial objectives. Before you can arrive at
the “appropriate” asset allocation, you should determine your current asset allocation.
Looking At Your Current Investment
Allocation
The first step to determine whether your current investment portfolio allocation is
correct for you is to calculate your current portfolio composition and then compare it
to a mix of assets (see next section) that may be more appropriate for you.
Worksheet 13-4 is an example of what I’d like to see you complete for yourself in
Worksheet 13-5. Using these worksheets, you list what kind of investments you own.
The results of this exercise provide you with your current investment portfolio alloca-
tion. From there, you can better assess whether this allocation is appropriate for your
needs and objectives.
If you have any trouble determining the subcategory for a specific investment, check
with your investment’s prospectus or annual report. (The prospectus is the booklet
that you receive when you make the investment in the first place. If you don’t still have
the copy, you can request another from the company who sold you the investment.
The annual reports are mailed to you automatically once a year. You can also request
these booklets directly from the investment provider.) If you have Internet access, the
easiest way to determine an investment’s subcategory is by visiting www.MorningStar.
com, which is a Web site that provides some of the best free and low-cost articles, tools
and research on stocks, exchange-traded funds, and mutual funds.

Chapter 13: Evaluating Your Current Portfolio

Determining Where Your Assets Need to Be
Asset allocation involves spreading your investments across diverse asset classes in an
attempt to reduce the overall portfolio risk, while maintaining or increasing expected
portfolio return. In other words, one investment you own may be zigging when another
one is zagging. Everything doesn’t go up and down at the same time. Some invest-
ments zig, while some zag, and the net result is smoother investment portfolio 
performance.
You may want to just skip right over this asset allocation stuff and head straight to the
interesting things, such as picking stocks and mutual funds. However, I encourage you
not to make that mistake. Two significant academic studies performed within the last
20 years overwhelmingly concluded that more than 90 percent of a portfolio’s long-
term variation in return was explained by its weighting between stocks, bonds, and
cash; in other words, it’s more important that you have investments in stocks than
which individual stocks you own or when you bought them. Only a small portion of
the returns were explained by the investment manager’s individual investment selec-
tions. Asset allocation decisions are the fundamental building blocks on which all good
portfolios are designed.
Figuring out the appropriate asset allocation for your portfolio depends on your
unique circumstances. To get started, check out Worksheets 13-6 and 13-7, which focus
on your time horizon, tolerance for investment risk, and, of course, your personal
goals. You should consider each table along with the others because in order to deter-
mine the appropriate asset allocation for your needs, you must take into account all
three of these components. (Refer to your risk tolerance Worksheet 13-2, earlier in this
chapter, for additional information.)
Worksheet 13-6 is a guideline that tells you how much of your total investments should
be in stocks or stock mutual funds based on when you’ll need this money. Think of time
horizon as the date that you need to withdraw those dollars from your investment port-
folio to support your standard of living in retirement. For example, if you’re 60 years old
right now and plan to retire in five years, your time horizon isn’t five years. Your time
horizon begins five years from now and may go for two to four decades — for the rest of
your life. So, the first withdrawal you make does have a time horizon of five years. The
next annual withdrawal you make has a time horizon of six years, and so on.
Worksheet 13-7 gives you the lowdown on how much of your total investment portfolio
should be invested in stocks or stock mutual funds based on your responses to your
risk tolerance questions (see Worksheet 13-2) regarding your maximum tolerable loss
(the maximum amount of money you can handle losing).

After looking at Worksheets 13-6 and 13-7, you may likely discover that the maximum
equity exposure will be different depending on your time horizon and your maximum
tolerable loss in a given year. If you discover a discrepancy between the maximum
equity exposures for your time horizon and your maximum tolerable loss in a given
year, I suggest that you select the lower of the two equity exposures.
Now, based on the maximum equity exposure that you’re comfortable with and that is
appropriate for your time horizon, look at what your average annual rate of return
would have been if you’d invested in 1926 and stayed invested through 2000 by check-
ing out Worksheet 13-8. This worksheet can provide you with some perspective as to
what types of returns investors realized through history with these ratios between
stocks and bonds.
183
Chapter 13: Evaluating Your Current Portfolio

Historical performance can’t be expected to repeat itself. But the relationship to the
amount of stock exposure to performance is highly correlated. If you have more stock
(and therefore are taking more risk), you should receive more return over time.

Computing Your Current Savings Rate
Knowing what you’re currently saving is an important part of making sure that you’ll achieve
your financial objectives (see Chapter 4). What percentage of your gross income (the amount
of money you earn before paying taxes or anything else) are you saving? To answer this ques-
tion, follow the computation in Worksheet 14-1.

Making Savings Happen
I don’t know about you, but if I didn’t have my savings and investing going out of my check-
ing account or paycheck on a regular basis, it wouldn’t happen like it should. Most people
I have consulted for deal with this same issue. Most people in the United States spend 100
percent of their income — an unfortunate reality. However, you know better. You can’t spend
it all now and still have what you need for your future.
The first thing I’d like you to do is to establish an automatic withdrawal plan from your pay-
check or checking account and set aside money each month to cover large periodic expenses
that you incur, such as annual vacations, holidays, estimated taxes, real estate taxes, home
remodeling, auto insurance, life insurance, and so on. Determine how much you need to cover

all of your periodic expenses throughout the year and divide that number by 12 to
arrive at your monthly savings requirement. Have this amount withdrawn from your
paycheck or checking account every month and set aside into one or more money
market accounts. When those periodic expenses arise, you’ll then have the funds avail-
able to pay them.
Consider establishing an automatic escrow account for your mandatory expenses and
a separate automatic escrow account for your discretionary expenses. Mandatory
expenses must be paid. Discretionary expenses (or spending) occurs only if you have
the money set aside for these purchases. If not, you may find yourself using your
credit cards when you shouldn’t. For an example, check out Worksheet 14-2. Then you
can figure it out for yourself by using Worksheet 14-3.

Establishing Automatic Investment
Programs for Retirement
You may want to consider establishing automatic investment programs to save for
your retirement. Here’s how you do it:
1. Make sure that you’re taking full advantage of any employer matching contri-
bution for which you may be eligible with your company’s retirement plan.
Contribute the maximum amount that the employer will match. If your employer
doesn’t make a matching contribution, skip directly to Step 2.
2. If eligible, make the maximum contributions to your and your spouse’s (if
applicable) Roth IRA accounts each year, but make your contributions
automatically out of your checking account each month.
A Roth IRA is the best retirement funding vehicle — from a tax standpoint —
ever! Although you don’t get a deduction when you contribute to a Roth IRA,
all the earnings and withdrawals on the account are tax-free forever.

Chapter 14: Maximizing Investment Strategies

If you’re single and have an adjusted gross income (AGI) of less than $99,000, or
you’re married filing jointly and have an AGI of less than $156,000, you can make
a contribution up to $4,000 in 2007 and $5,000 in 2008. However, if you’re over
50 years of age, you can invest even more: $5,000 in 2007 and $6,000 in 2008.
You can establish a Roth IRA account at most banks, through investment advi-
sors, or my personal favorites: directly with a low-cost, no-load mutual fund
company, like Vanguard (www.vanguard.com) or a deep discount broker like
Scottrade (www.scottrade.com) or ShareBuilder (http://sharebuilder.com).
Making monthly contributions is much easier than coming up with the whole
year’s contribution at once. You can set up automatic investments directly from
your checking account into your Roth IRA account. For example, if you were eli-
gible to take this step in 2007, the maximum allowable contribution is $4,000 per
person if you’re under 50 years of age and $5,000 per person if you’re 50 or older.
Those contributions work out to be $333 per month and $416 per month respec-
tively, depending on your age.
3. Build your personal portfolio utilizing low-cost, tax-advantaged-passive invest-
ment vehicles, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and index funds.
You need to have investments that you can tap into if needed prior to retirement
or age 591⁄2. Also, when you retire and pull money out of your retirement account,
100 percent of that withdrawal is taxable to you as ordinary income. Capital
gains tax rates are much lower. You may be much better off from a tax stand-
point to pay minimal capital gains now, rather than the tax for ordinary income
in the future.
Index funds are a way individual investors can own the stock market that you
hear about on the news, such as the Standard and Poor 500 Composite Index
(S & P 500, for short). Index funds have been available through no-load mutual
fund powerhouses like Vanguard for decades. However, the range of options
now available has exploded in the last few years. You can now buy an exchange-
traded fund that invests exclusively in United States Treasury Inflation Protection
Securities. Rather than buying one bond for $10,000, you can literally buy one
share of an ETF, which trades like stocks, incurring a transaction fee to buy or
sell shares.
You can find index funds and exchange-traded funds for every asset class imagi-
nable. And the beauty of these vehicles is their low cost and tax efficiency.
However, not all options are created equal. For more information, check out
Mutual Funds For Dummies and Exchange Traded Funds For Dummies.
With the advent of deep-discount online brokerage firms like ShareBuilder
(www.ShareBuilder.com) and FOLIOfn (www.FOLIOfn.com), you now can afford
to make monthly purchases of exchange-traded funds. Both firms also have an
online tool designed to help you identify your investing goals, gauge your invest-
ing style, and determine your risk tolerance (which you can also do in Chapter
13 in this book). By evaluating your answers to a series of basic investment
objective and risk tolerance types of questions, ShareBuilder’s PortfolioBuilder
presents you with a model portfolio of exchange-traded funds that is designed to
fit your needs and objectives. You can access this automated service for the sub-
scription price of $12 a month, which also includes six commission-free trades to
buy or sell any stock or exchange-traded fund in your account.
Based on these steps, which automatic savings programs are available to you, and
how much can you direct to each of these automatic plans? Use Worksheet 14-4 to put
these steps in action.

Determining the Right Approach 
to Fund Each Goal
Your primary financial objectives (which you can set in stone in Chapter 4) may
include raising money for a down payment on a home, remodeling a new home, provid-
ing for your children’s college education, or retiring comfortably. Worksheet 14-5 out-
lines these objectives and the investment vehicles and funding strategies you should
consider for each goal.

College
Your options include Education Savings Accounts, 529 Plans, and accumu-
lating funds in tax-efficient investments in the parent’s name — earmarked
for child’s college education.
Depending on the age(s) of your children, you may be best served by
having some stocks and mutual funds. Use this table as a guide.

Education Savings Accounts can be opened with low-cost, no-commis-
sion mutual fund companies. Consider their Target Maturity/Retirement
date. These mutual fund assets are allocated across a broad range of
investments and will shift allocation more conservatively as your target
date for needing the funds draws nearer.
529 Plans issued through most states typically also have the target matu-
rity option. If they don’t, select an investment option offered by your
state’s 529 Plan administrator that does not exceed your maximum
equity exposure limit due to your time horizon.
190
Part IV: Building and Managing Wealth 

Index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds can be excellent, low-
cost, tax-efficient investment options when saving for college in your
name. Watch your maximum equity exposure.
Retirement
First, pick the best options available through your employer’s retirement
plan and invest up to the matching contribution by your employer.
Often, the investment options available to you in a company retirement
plan are somewhat to very limited. Look for the best options available
through the plan. You need not concern yourself with tax efficiency, so
avoid using the Index option(s), if you have other good choices available
that you need to round out your overall asset allocation (for example,
international stock funds, small company funds, bond funds, or fixed
income).
Next, continue rounding out your targeted asset allocation with your
Roth IRA contribution. Once again, tax efficiency is not a concern within
this account. However, you do have virtually unlimited investment
options. Use your Roth IRA to complete those hard-to-fill components of
your portfolio allocation, such as high-yield bonds, foreign bonds, or
income-paying real estate investment trusts (also known as REITs).
Finally, complete your retirement funding requirement through your per-
sonal portfolio. This is where tax efficiency is critical. Low-cost, tax-
efficient investments such as index funds and exchange-traded funds
can best be used here. Your investment options are only limited by
excessive costs and taxation; avoid those and you’ll be doing well.
Computing Your Rate of Return 
on Your Investments
The best way to find out how your investments are doing is to find your rate of return,
which is the total gain or loss on an investment or on your total portfolio over a
period of time.
To find your year-to-date rate of return, compare the total value of your account today —
or at the end of the preceding month — with the total value of your account at the end of
last year (or since you originally invested) and then compare that rate of return to your
personal objectives and the rates of return provided by similar investment options
during that same period of time. Visit www.morningstar.com, a premier resource for
mutual fund and stock information, for a listing of mutual fund rates of return by invest-
ment style, which you can use to compare to your own rates of return.

Take time to compute your savings rate and the rate of return on your total investment
portfolio at least once every year. This information can help you determine whether
you’re on target to meet your financial objectives.
Tracking Your Progress
Not only is it important to compute your savings rate and the rate of return on your
investment portfolio (see previous sections), you also should keep track of your
progress over time. As time passes and your financial objectives draw nearer, you will
have a visual “measuring stick” you can use as a guide to determine whether you’re on
track. If you find yourself falling behind, you may need to increase your savings contri-
butions. However, if you’ve been saving diligently, and the market has rewarded you
handsomely, you may find that you can attain your objectives earlier than originally
planned.
You can use Worksheet 14-7 to track your overall progress on your investments —
both savings goals and total account value.

P
eople are exposed to many different types of risks in their financial lives. In this chap-
ter, I identify the major risks and suggest practical and effective ways to deal with
these risks — typically that means insurance.
Identifying Types of Risk
Finance and investing textbooks define two primary types of risk:
 Systematic risk is the type of risk that is impossible to avoid completely. Examples
of systematic risk include inflation, recessions, and war. You can do either very little or
nothing to protect yourself from systematic risks, and no amount of portfolio diversifi-
cation can eliminate systemic risk.
 Unsystematic risk is a risk that affects an isolated group of companies, industries,
or countries. A company’s stock plummeting after the news that the FDA declined
approval of its highly anticipated new drug is an example of unsystematic risk.
Diversification substantially reduces or eliminates unsystematic risks.
Systematic and unsystematic risks are the textbook definitions of financial risks, but what
about the rest of the risks that you face in everyday life? Risk is better defined as uncertainty —
the inability to know what the future brings. For example:
 Will you continue to be employed?
 Will your company require you to relocate?
 What happens if your teenager wrecks the car?
 What if the interest rate on your adjustable rate mortgage skyrockets?
 What if your in-laws have to move in?
 What happens if you live to be a Centurion?
 What happens if your child or significant other is diagnosed with a long-term illness
requiring you to quit your job and stay home to care for your loved one?
 What happens if you wake up at age 60 and discover that you no longer want to have to
work for a living, but you haven’t saved enough to retire?
 What happens if your spouse dies prematurely?
 What if your home is destroyed by a flood?
 What if you’re sued because your dog bites the neighbor’s kid?

The list could go on and on. The point I’m trying to make is that life is filled with uncer-
tainty. Some risks you may choose to bear. Others may be reduced, but the balance
should be transferred to somebody else — typically an insurance company. Insurance
should be purchased when you can’t afford to bear the risk personally (see the section
“Utilizing Insurance to Help Combat Risk” later in this chapter).
Eliminating, Minimizing, or Transferring Risk
Successful financial planning involves anticipating future events and all probable
outcomes — both good and bad. Risk management attempts to eliminate, minimize,
or transfer the risk of all your anticipated bad outcomes.
You can handle several risks without much hardship, if you have sufficient cash
reserves on hand. For example, your teenager wrecks the car — hopefully, no one is
hurt, and you have auto insurance — but you also need some cash to cover the
deductible due before your insurance kicks in. You may even need additional cash to
pay for a rental car until yours can be repaired. In this example, you have shouldered a
certain amount of risk yourself: the deductible and the cost of the rental car. You have
also transferred the majority of the financial risk to the auto insurance company.
Establishing a safety net of three to six months worth of cash reserves, adequately
insuring your home and property, your health, and your income, and remaining very
aware of potential dangers goes a long way toward ensuring that you and your family
won’t be financially devastated when bad things happen — and they do happen. It’s
not a matter of if, but a matter of what and when.
Use Worksheet 15-1 to brainstorm on possible future events in your financial life and
how these issues may be eliminated, minimized, or transferred (in other words, insured
against). As you consider the bad things that can happen in your life, be reassured that
you can take steps to help reduce the pain through proper risk-management techniques.

Part V: Protecting Your Assets 

Utilizing Insurance to Help Combat Risk
Most likely, you wouldn’t even consider not having homeowners or auto insurance. 
But when do you actually have a need for insurance? Review the questions in
Worksheet 15-2 and check the boxes of the situations that apply to you. If any or 
all of these issues apply to you, you need insurance.
Worksheet 15-2
You Need Insurance If. . .
❏You can’t afford to pay cash (in other words, self-insure) to repair or replace your
vehicle if you’re in an accident.
❏You want to reduce your possibility of being sued. (Yes, you are exposed to liabil-
ities, in more ways than you probably imagine — such as car accidents, a tree
from your yard damaging your neighbors’ house, or your dog biting the mail car-
rier. Each could result in a lawsuit.)
❏You can’t afford to pay cash to repair your home in the event of a fire, damaging
wind, or a hail storm. If you can’t afford major repairs, you definitely can’t afford
to replace your home if it is destroyed.
❏You can’t afford to pay cash for adequate medical care in the event of illness or
injury.
❏You need long-term medical care and aren’t able to pay for it comfortably out of
your own pocket.
❏You need your income to survive.
❏Your family needs your income to survive.
❏You have assets to protect.
❏You’d be more comfortable transferring big financial risks to an insurance
company.
If you checked one or many of the boxes in Worksheet 15-2, you may need to consider
the following types of insurance:
 Disability: Did you know that there is actually a greater likelihood that you will
become disabled for a period (at least three months prior to age 65) than die?
Likely, your most significant asset is your ability to earn money. So you need to ask
yourself: Should I become disabled, how would I cover my living expenses? How
will I be able to save for retirement? And because an overwhelming majority of dis-
abilities are health related, can I afford the risk of being without a paycheck and
possibly having increased healthcare expenses?
Protecting your income by purchasing disability insurance is one of the funda-
mental risk management strategies I recommend for all wage earners whose
income is required to maintain their lifestyles. The two primary types of disabil-
ity insurance include
Short- term: Coverage will provide income replacement protection, usually
after one week of disability, and will pay for up to six months.
Long-term: This type of disability insurance kicks in generally at the six-
month mark and continues until age 65.
If you happen to have disability insurance through your employer, you likely
have only long-term disability coverage, and typically the coverage ranges
between 60 and 70 percent of your current gross salary. So, if you’re struggling to
get ahead on 100 percent of your salary, how do you think your finances will
work on 60 to 70 percent of what you’re currently making? What if you don’t
happen to have disability insurance?
197
Chapter 15: Managing Risk with Insurance

 Life: Under most circumstances, you need life insurance to protect your surviv-
ing family who depend on your income for as long as they’ll need it. I have met
very few people who have enough life insurance. In fact, the overwhelming
majority of Americans are drastically underinsured in the event of premature
death. Don’t leave your family in this predicament!
I also recommend that a stay-at-home parent obtain life insurance, although not
to protect the family from their loss of income, but rather to help offset the addi-
tional costs that it would take to replace that stay-at-home parent’s services.
Example: To replace the services of a stay-at-home mom, caring for a 3-year-old
and a newborn would cost $30,000 per year or more for a full-time nanny to care
for the children until the youngest is in school. In addition, the children would
need after-school care for several more years, and you might need a number of
other domestic services too. All these expenses add up to $250,000 or more of
life insurance needed on the stay-at-home parent.
Fortunately, term life insurance is actually quite affordable, presuming that
you’re fairly healthy. The cost of a high-quality, 20-year level term life insurance
policy on a young mother may cost $300 to $400 per year — a level premium for
20 years!
 Health: Nearly one out of five Americans under age 65 has no health insurance.
Over half of these people state cost as the reason they don’t have health insur-
ance. Almost 25 percent of uninsured people lost their health insurance when
they lost or changed jobs. The unfortunate thing about insurance is that if you
can’t afford the premium, you definitely won’t be able to afford bearing the risk
yourself. (For more on health insurance, see Chapter 16.)
 Long-term care: Medicare or your health insurance policy will not pay for long-
term care expenses in a nursing home or other long-term care facility. These
expenses are covered in one of three ways: self pay, long-term care insurance, or
Medicaid — and you have to be nearly broke to qualify for Medicaid.
Given the likelihood of an extended long-term care need, I advise you to consider
purchasing long-term care insurance the day before you’re going to need it.
Unfortunately, you can’t know what day that will be, so for practical purposes,
I strongly suggest purchasing long-term care insurance between ages 50 and 65.
The older you are, the more expensive the premiums. The price of the insurance
goes up as you get older, and the likelihood of needing long-term care insurance
increases. Coverage isn’t available for anyone over 80 years of age. The insur-
ance premiums are quite expensive, as is the cost of care. Weigh your risks
wisely: Don’t be pennywise and pound foolish.
 Auto: If you own a vehicle and ever let it out of the garage, you must have auto
insurance. Depending on the value of your vehicle and your state’s requirements,
the type of automobile insurance you should carry will vary. Refer to Chapter 18
for the details. 
 Homeowners: If you own a home and you have a mortgage, you must maintain
adequate homeowners insurance protection. Your mortgage company requires
it. However, if you happen to own your home outright, you still need to have
homeowners insurance. Remember, you buy insurance to replace or repair the
things that are too expensive or impossible to pay for yourself.
 Liability: You have some liability insurance protection provided with both your
auto and homeowners insurance coverages. Liability insurance pays for legal
fees and damages if you hurt someone or cause injury due to your negligence. In
addition to the coverage available through your auto and homeowner’s insur-
ance policies, you may also determine that additional liability insurance is war-
ranted. Refer to Chapter 18 for more information.
For a more detailed description of these types of insurance as well as an assessment of
your current insurance and coverage needs, see the rest of Part V.
198
Part V: Protecting Your Assets 

Evaluating the Quality of Insurance
You buy insurance to protect your income, your family, and your assets from financial
ruin. However, just any ol’ insurance won’t do. You owe it to yourself and your loved
ones to obtain and maintain the correct type and amount of coverage from a finan-
cially secure insurance company.
Insurance is worth nothing if the company isn’t around to pay claims when you’re in
need. And you definitely don’t want to waste money paying for insurance that won’t
pay off if the need arises because the insurer argues that your loss isn’t covered.
Become an informed consumer by doing your own research. Check out the quality
companies and the types of insurance you feel you need before you contact an agent.
Worksheet 15-3 is a checklist of the major issues to check out and consider when eval-
uating your current insurance coverages or considering purchasing new policies.
Throughout Part V, I get very specific about each of the different types of insurance
policies that most people need to consider. This worksheet covers the basics.
Worksheet 15-3
Key Quality Insurance Issues to Consider
❏Financial strength of the insurance company:
• Check out A.M. Best ratings (www.ambest.com) on any home, auto, life, or
health insurance company, and only do business with the financially
strongest companies. The financially strongest companies can also be
extremely competitively priced. You don’t have to give up security to save
money.
• You can also see how Standard and Poors rates these same companies at
www.standardandpoors.com; go to Task Selector, Find a Rating, and then
click on Insurance.
❏Claims payment history and customer service ratings:
• Visit your state insurance regulators’ Web site or call the regulators’ office
and inquire about the insurance company’s complaint history.
• Check out the rankings on overall customer satisfaction, claims payment
history, pricing, and communications with J.D. Power and Associates at
www.jdpower.com.
• Another great resource to check out a company’s customer service history
is Consumer Reports (www.consumerreports.org). Click Personal Finance
and then Insurance. Consumer Reports online is available for a modest
annual subscription price.
❏Price: You can find many online resources that enable you to obtain quotes and
additional information so that you can do some comparison shopping. I suggest
the following Web sites:
• www.ehealthinsurance.com
• www.insure.com
• www.insurance.com
• www.selectquote.com
After you’ve had the opportunity to check out the financial strength of an insurance
company, whether its customers are happy, and whether its price is competitive,
you’ve greatly narrowed your selection. The only things remaining are the specific
“bells and whistles” of the insurance coverages you currently own or are considering.
199
Chapter 15: Managing Risk with Insurance

The rest of Part V focuses on the “bells and whistles” for each of the primary types of
insurance products.
When you comparison shop, I suggest that you get quotes on comparable policies
from three different sources. The three primary ways to obtain insurance quotes and
products are through the following:
 A captive agent represents only one company, such as Allstate, State Farm, or
American Family. It may seem that a captive agent may not be the best way to go;
however, I have found that captive agents can be extremely competitive and pro-
vide exceptional customer service, especially for home and auto coverage.
However, you won’t likely want to acquire all your insurance through one captive
agent. These types of companies often aren’t the most competitive in the areas
of life, health, disability, and long-term care insurance.
 An independent agent represents multiple insurers. Independent agents can
do a lot of comparison shopping for you and may be able to provide you with
one-stop shopping for all of your insurance needs; however, don’t count on it.
Shop around — even among independent agents there can be a huge difference
in their offerings.
 Buying directly from the insurance company is another option. Don’t count on
any personalized attention, but you may save some money. However, I wouldn’t
suggest buying certain types of insurance, such as long-term care, disability, or
medical insurance, without the guidance of an insurance professional.
Many insurance agents and companies out there are very interested in parting you
from your money. In almost every case, insurance agents are paid only when they sell
you a policy, and the more they sell you, the more money they make. Unfortunately,
too often insurance agents don’t put your best interest first. Above all, remember that
insurance agents are sales people. In my work as a financial advisor, I’ve seen so many
cases where people have been ripped off by an insurance agent. What’s worse is that
many times these agents were family members or alleged friends. Caveat emptor =
Buyer beware!

Exploring Your Insurance Options
In This Chapter

 Evaluating disability income protection
C
an you afford the risk of not being able to pay for medical care or hospitalization, or
losing your paycheck? If the answer is no, you should do everything within your power
to obtain the appropriate coverage to insure you from the financial devastation of these
risks. In this chapter, I tell you what you need to know to protect yourself and your family at
all stages in life.
Under Age 65: Exploring Your 
Health Insurance Options
The majority of individuals and families have health insurance through their employers.
You’re likely best off with your employer’s group plan than any other option that may be
available to you. Group coverage is easier and much less expensive to get than private insur-
ance. Plus, your employer may pay most or all of the cost for you, and you can’t be denied
coverage. However, if you change jobs, get laid off, or are fired, you can lose your group
health insurance. If you find yourself without employer-sponsored health insurance, the fol-
lowing options may be available to you:
 Individual health insurance: Perhaps your employer doesn’t offer health insurance,
or you’re self-employed, a student, or retired before age 65. If you’re relatively healthy,
you should purchase an individual health insurance policy.
Certain health conditions, such as a recent back injury or treatment for high blood
pressure, may be excluded from coverage for a period of time, generally up to two
years. In some circumstances, pre-existing health conditions will be covered; however,
your cost for insurance can be substantially higher than it would be if the pre-existing
health conditions weren’t covered. Each insurance company may treat pre-existing
health conditions differently and can deny you coverage altogether.
Paying the extra cost and obtaining full coverage is generally better than having a pre-
existing condition excluded from your health insurance policy.
To find more info about individual health insurance, contact a health insurance
broker in your area by visiting the National Association of Health Underwriters at
www.nahu.org/consumer/findagent.cfm. eHealthInsurance online also provides
individual, short-term, and student health insurance plans. You can obtain quotes and
information at www.ehealthinsurance.com or call 800-977-8860 to discuss any current
medical conditions or questions you may have. Licensed insurance professionals are

available to answer questions, provide advice, and assist you in the application
process.
 COBRA: A provision in the law requires almost all employers to allow their ter-
minating employees to continue group insurance coverage for a period of up to
18 months through a program called COBRA. However, you must pay 100 percent
of the cost of the insurance.
As your COBRA benefit period nears its end (generally after 18 months) or you
get tired of paying those high premium rates for very comprehensive health
insurance coverage, you need to search out group health insurance that’s equal
to or a better deal on your own. Generally, employer-sponsored plans (which is
still who your COBRA coverage is through) have very low or no deductibles
and minimal copayments. Simply by raising the deductible and copayments —
bearing more of the risk yourself — you could dramatically reduce your insur-
ance costs.
 HIPAA: The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996
requires that states provide at least a minimal coverage after you exhaust
COBRA benefits, as long as you haven’t had any extended lapse (generally a
break of 63 days or more) in coverage. Premiums under HIPAA may be two to
three times what they would be for a standard rate policy. HIPAA policies are typ-
ically an option of last resort for many people without employer-provided health
insurance; however, HIPAA is still better than no health insurance at all. Each
state has its own HIPAA rules, so contact your state insurance department before
dropping any current coverage.
 Your state’s high-risk health insurance pool: If you happen to be medically unin-
surable due to significant health problems, your best option may be to apply for
coverage through the high-risk pool through your state, if your state has a high-
risk health insurance pool available. Only 33 states have high-risk pools that
provide coverage if traditional health insurance providers reject you. For more
information about whether your state has a high-risk insurance pool and how
it works, contact The National Association of State Comprehensive Health
Insurance Plans at www.naschip.org or your state insurance commissioner’s
office. Most states have their insurance premiums capped at 125 percent to
150 percent of the cost of a standard policy.
Even if your state has a high-risk insurance pool, you may not be able to obtain
insurance immediately because there may be a long waiting list.
 Medicaid and other state-based healthcare programs: If you’re financially desti-
tute, Medicaid is the nation’s largest program providing healthcare services to low-
income individuals and households. Each state’s Medicaid income, eligibility
requirements, and benefits vary. Check with your state for the specifics on
Medicaid as well as other state-based programs. You can go to www.nahu.org/
consumer/healthcare/topic.cfm?catID=18 for more info.
 State Children’s Health Insurance Program: This program provides healthcare
coverage to children when their families don’t qualify for Medicaid because they
make too much money. Find out more at www.nahu.org/consumer/healthcare/
topic.cfm?catID=19.
 Federally funded community health centers: These provide healthcare assis-
tance to the needy. Go to http://ask.hrsa.gov/pc/ or call 800-ASK-HRSA
(800-275-4772) for more info.
J.D. Power and Associates has a very helpful health insurance plan rating tool accessi-
ble at www.jdpower.com/insurance/ratings/health-plans. You enter the region
of the country you’re located in, and a list of health insurance companies are provided,
based on their ranking regarding the following criteria:

 Overall experience
 Coverage and benefits
 Choice of doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies
 Information and communications
 Approval processes
 Insurance statements
 Customer service

You can also use Worksheet 16-1, which lists the health insurance options that may be
available to you. The list is ranked with the more comprehensive and cost-effective
insurance options at the top, ending with the options of last resort for many people. I
have also included government programs that are available for those people with
financial hardships.
Worksheet 16-1
Health Insurance Options
Group Coverage
❏Are you employed and your employer offers health insurance? If so, take advan-
tage of it.
❏Is your spouse employed by an employer who offers family coverage?
❏If you aren’t married but have a domestic partner, does his employer offer
domestic partner health insurance benefits?
❏Are you planning to terminate your employment in the near future and you’re
under age 65? If you’re relatively healthy, consult with a health insurance broker
about your options prior to terminating your employment. You may find compet-
itive private insurance; if not, go with COBRA.
Personal Coverage
❏Do you currently have health insurance, but are curious as to whether you may
be able to obtain better or more competitively priced coverage? Check into
obtaining private health insurance coverage.
❏Are you uninsurable due to a serious medical condition? Check whether your
state has a high-risk insurance pool.
❏Have you exhausted your COBRA benefits and can’t find replacement coverage?
If so, use HIPAA.
Options for the Financially Destitute
❏Are you broke? Medicaid or other state-based healthcare assistance programs
may be your answer.
❏Do you need healthcare coverage for your children, but you don’t qualify for
Medicaid due to income requirements? You may want to check out the State
Children’s Health Insurance Program or check into federally funded community
healthcare centers.

Chapter 16: Exploring Your Insurance Options

Age 65 or Older: Obtaining Health Insurance
Prior to retirement, you’re likely covered by your employer’s health insurance plan (if
not, see previous section). However, what do you do for health insurance after retire-
ment? Many people must postpone retirement until age 65 merely because they need
to wait to retire until they qualify for the government’s healthcare program, also
known as Medicare. Worksheet 16-2 summarizes these benefits. You’re eligible for
Medicare if you or your spouse worked for at least ten years in Medicare-covered
employment, and you’re age 65 or older and a citizen or permanent resident of the
United States. If you’re not yet age 65, you may qualify for coverage if you have a dis-
ability. (Call 800-633-4227 or visit www.medicare.gov for more information on
Medicare.)

Part C: Medicare Advantage Plans
Medicare Advantage Plans are approved by Medicare but offered through private insur-
ance companies. Sometimes these plans can be comparable in benefits, but more cost-
effective than the original Medicare plan combined with a Medicare supplemental (also
known as Medigap) policy. These plans vary greatly in cost and benefits, state by state,
so you must research your plan options thoroughly before you join.
Part D: Medicare Prescription Drug Program
This program is new as of 2007. The Medicare prescription drug program allows
anyone eligible for Medicare to pay extra insurance premiums and receive different
levels of prescription drug coverage. For more information, visit the Center for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) at www.cms.hhs.gov. This site provides online
tools that can help you compare plans that are available in your area. Another great
resource is the Department of the Elderly in your state of residence, because it has
counselors on hand to personally assist you in finding the best plan for your needs.
You may access a list of state offices at www.medicare.gov/contacts/
static/allStateContacts.asp.
How do you know which part of Medicare you qualify for? And how do you know
you’re fully insured? Here are some guidelines:
 If you’re eligible for Social Security retirement benefits, you’re automatically eli-
gible for Part A of the Medicare program (which I describe in Worksheet 16-2),
beginning with the first day of the month in which you turn age 65. If you started
Social Security retirement benefits before age 65, you don’t need to do anything
to begin receiving Medicare Part A benefits. If you’re eligible for, but aren’t yet
receiving your Social Security retirement benefits, you must apply separately for
Medicare Part A.
 If you’re receiving Social Security retirement benefits, you’re automatically
enrolled in Medicare Part B at the time you become eligible for Medicare Part A,
unless you elect to opt out of Part B coverage.
Even though you must pay a monthly premium for Medicare Part B, this plan is
extremely cost-effective for the benefits provided, so you should not waive your
right to this coverage.
 To be fully insured, I strongly recommend that you consider supplementing your
Medicare coverage with Medicare supplemental insurance, also known as Medigap
coverage, which generally pays the deductibles and copayments not covered by
Medicare Parts A or B. Medigap policies — which vary from basic (represented
by letter A in Worksheet 16-3) to comprehensive (letter J) — are sold by private
insurance companies to fill in the gaps in the original Medicare plan and have
federal standards. Most states have now adopted regulations limiting the sale of
Medigap insurance to no more than the standard policies.
You can check out the basics of a Medigap policy in Worksheet 16-3. Review the
features of each of these plans to determine what may be best for your health
needs and budget. For more information about the details of the various plans in
your state, visit www.medicare.gov/MPPF/Include/DataSection/Questions/

Part V: Protecting Your Assets 

Preparing for Long-Term Healthcare Needs
A few decades ago, when an elderly person needed healthcare assistance, she relied
on her extended family. However, society has changed — and not necessarily for the
better. If you can’t take care of yourself and you don’t have any family members around
to provide for your care, you have many other options from which to choose: home
healthcare, adult daycare, assisted-living facilities, and nursing homes. Unfortunately,
obtaining these services for any length of time requires a substantial amount of money.
For example, the current cost of a nursing home stay runs between $150 and $250 a day
depending on what part of the country you live in. Assisted-living facilities tend to run at
about half that price. Home healthcare can easily cost as much as a nursing home stay.
But the majority of individuals I have met feel very strongly about staying in their homes
as long as possible, so home healthcare may be a very attractive option for you as well.
If you or your spouse need long-term care for even a few weeks, let alone a few years,
your family’s financial plans may be devastated. Few people are able to self-insure (pay
out of their own pockets) for the cost of long-term care. And don’t count on the govern-
ment to step in and cover these costs for you. Medicare provides a very minimal benefit.
Medicaid is the only government program that provides funds to help cover long-term
care expenses, but to qualify for Medicaid, you have to be nearly broke. (See the section
“Under Age 65: Exploring Your Health Insurance Options” for more on Medicaid.)
Knowing whether you will need long-term care is very hard to say. The current esti-
mate says that about one-third of men and about one-half of women over age 65 are
expected to need two years or more of long-term care assistance during their lifetimes.
Can you afford to pay for this type of care out of your retirement nest egg? If so, you
can self-insure. If not, you have two primary options:
 Take your chances. Maybe you’ll be one of the fortunate ones and not require
long-term care assistance, or possibly your extended family will provide the care
you need.
 Buy long-term care insurance. Long-term care insurance is insurance you pur-
chase to help offset the cost of long-term healthcare. I feel that middle-income
Americans should strongly consider long-term care insurance, at least by the time
they’re age 65. The odds are that if you’re age 65 or older, you will need long-term
healthcare assistance of some sort for at least one year and possibly much longer.
You should not buy long-term care insurance if:
 You don’t have enough income to afford the premiums.
 You don’t have many assets to protect or a desire to protect them for your heirs.
 You have a limited income.
You should consider buying long-term care insurance if:
 You have substantial assets and income.
 You want to protect the majority of your assets for your heirs.
 You don’t want to depend on others to provide for your care or support.

Chapter 16: Exploring Your Insurance Options

If you determine that you should consider long-term care insurance, how do you know
when you should buy it? The perfect time to buy long-term care insurance is the day
before you need it. Unfortunately, my crystal ball isn’t clear enough to figure out when
that exact day will come. So instead, you have to weigh your options. The longer you
wait to buy long-term care insurance, the higher the likelihood that you may be
deemed uninsurable. However, the longer you wait to buy the insurance, the less
money you’re going to spend on insurance premiums before you might receive
benefits.
For example: If you purchase the insurance in your 40s or 50s, you may pay premiums
totaling over $100,000 before you actually begin to claim benefits — if you even need to
claim benefits at all. But if you die in your sleep at home at age 90, then you’ve spent
over $100,000 in long-term care insurance premiums, and you didn’t need the coverage.
As you can see, you have to take on risk of some sort no matter when you purchase
long-term healthcare insurance. You just have to weigh the risks and choose which
option makes you most comfortable.
After you’ve determined the best time for you to buy long-term care insurance, I strongly
encourage you to do your research prior to contacting an agent. Long-term care costs
can be extremely expensive, but so can long-term care insurance. And comparing one
policy against another can also be difficult. Doing your own research can make you feel
more confident about your final decision. Then after you’ve done some legwork, contact
three independent agents and consult personally with each of them prior to making a
final decision. Be sure to compare the costs and benefits of each policy.
To help ease the shopping process, I recommend A Shopper’s Guide to Long-Term Care
Insurance published by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners is a great
resource to provide general information about long-term care insurance. You can
access a copy of this guide at www.michigan.gov/documents/cis_ofis_ltcshop_
23739_7.pdf.
Worksheet 16-4 is a checklist of items that I strongly recommend you review for each
of the long-term care insurance policies you consider. Some questions in this work-
sheet merely involve a yes or no answer; others may ask for a specific period of time,
number of days, amount of benefits, and so on. Please complete this checklist to the
best of your ability, and you’ll be in much better shape to compare policies and select
the one that is right for you.
Worksheet 16-4
Evaluating a Long-Term Care Policy
The policy under consideration provides for the cost of care at which of the following:
❏Skilled nursing facilities
❏Custodial nursing facilities
❏Assisted living facilities
❏Adult day care
❏Home healthcare
208
Part V: Protecting Your Assets 

Under what conditions will the policy begin to pay benefits?
❏Inability to perform (preferably no more than two) specific activities of daily
living, including bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, and transferring.
❏Cognitive impairment, such as a stroke, Alzheimer’s, or Parkinson’s disease
❏Certification by a doctor stating that long-term care is medically necessary, and,
if so, will the policy allow for your doctor to provide the certification?
When will benefits begin?
❏Is hospitalization required immediately before long-term care benefits will be paid?
❏How long is the waiting period before benefits will begin?
How long will benefits last? (Typically, benefit periods range from two years to lifetime.)
❏Is the policy structured to pay on a flat dollar amount per day or based on actual
costs up to that dollar amount?
❏Is there inflation protection on the benefit?
❏If there is inflation protection available, what is the inflation rate and is it simple
or compounded?
Other features to consider:
❏Does the policy allow you — not the insurance company — to choose a doctor?
❏Is the policy guaranteed renewable?
❏Is there a waiver of premium in the event benefits are being paid out?
❏Does this company offer a joint long-term care policy for couples, married or not?
Just because you’ve done extensive research doesn’t mean that you’re required to or
would be best served by purchasing a long-term care insurance policy. However, you
can be better able to make an educated decision about whether long-term care insur-
ance is right for you and your family. If you need additional help determining whether
long-term care insurance is right for you, I recommend consulting with an independent
insurance agent who specializes in long-term care insurance or a fee-only financial
advisor who charges by the hour.
After deciding that the long-term care insurance is appropriate for you, but you still
aren’t sure about paying the cost and want to consider ways to reduce the total cost of
coverage, check out the following tips:
 If available, purchase a long-term care insurance group policy through your
employer.
 Consider electing a 90-day waiting period, rather than a 30-day waiting period,
before the benefits begin. This option can reduce your premiums by up to
30 percent.
 If you’re married or in a long-term committed relationship and both of you can
benefit from long-term care insurance, look into buying a joint policy for the two
of you.
 Rather than buying a policy that provides a daily benefit equal to the cost of
nursing home facilities in your area today, you may want to consider purchasing
a lesser dollar amount and self-insuring the balance.

Chapter 16: Exploring Your Insurance Options

Protecting Your Income: Disability Insurance
Your ability to earn money is one of the most significant assets that you have.
Expenses often increase due to disability, while income is drastically reduced. In the
event that you’re unable to continue to earn your income because of illness or injury
for any period of time, your family’s financial plans could be ruined. 
Social Security includes a disability feature, but you’re considered disabled only if you
can’t perform any work; you have to wait for at least five months to initiate benefits;
and the amount you will receive will likely be less than 50 percent of your income.
The only way to protect yourself and your family from financial disaster is to maintain
adequate disability insurance. Disability insurance replaces a portion of your income in
the event you become ill or injured while insured. Disability insurance is very expen-
sive because the likelihood that you may need this benefit is relatively high. The risk
isn’t something that you likely can bear yourself, so you must transfer the risk to an
insurance company.
Disability insurance companies won’t sell you an insurance policy to replace 100 per-
cent of your income. However, they do sell policies that go up to about 70 percent of
your current income. If you don’t have at least 70 percent of your current income pro-
vided through your employer’s disability insurance plan, you should obtain supple-
mental coverage bringing you up to 70 percent. If your employer doesn’t provide any
disability insurance protection, you should be able to purchase a private policy pro-
viding you with up to 70 percent of your income.
If you currently need all your income to provide your standard of living and achieve
your financial goals, how are you going to make ends meet if you’re only bringing in 60
to 70 percent of your current income? What typically happens in real life is that people
have to make drastic cuts in their lifestyles. Whatever plans you may have had for
retirement, for that family vacation, or for paying for the kids’ college education are
now unattainable — unless you obtain as much disability insurance as you can get.
One of the most significant benefits of owning your own disability insurance policy is
that because you pay the premiums, the benefits you receive (should you become dis-
abled) are tax-free. Therefore, tax-free benefits of 70 percent of your current income
may be extremely comparable to 100 percent of your current taxable income. When
your employer, on the other hand, pays the premium on this insurance coverage,
100 percent of the benefits you receive under this policy are taxable as ordinary
income.
Disability insurance comes in two primary forms:
 Short-term: This type of disability insurance provides for benefits from the
eighth day of disability up to six months of disability. Most employers don’t pro-
vide short-term disability insurance benefits. And most individuals opt to self-
insure for the first three to six months of disability if they’re buying private
policies. Adequate cash reserves are necessary to cover your living expenses in
the event of disability until your insurance begins to pay benefits. (For more on
how to build up cash reserves, see Chapter 13.)
 Long-term: Disability insurance of this flavor generally kicks in after the first six
months of disability and typically pays benefits until age 65. Employer-sponsored,
long-term disability insurance may provide what is called own-occupation cover-
age for a period of up to two years. What this means is that if you’re unable to do
your job because of an illness or injury, your disability insurance provides you
210
Part V: Protecting Your Assets 

with benefits. However, at the end of that two-year period of time, or in most
cases from day one of your disability, the disability insurance policy pays for
benefits only if you’re unable to do any meaningful work that you’re reasonably
trained to do. Insurance that guarantees to pay if you’re unable to perform the
duties of your occupation is substantially more expensive than a policy that guar-
antees to pay benefits if you’re unable to work at all.
I recommend that you obtain as much own-occupation, long-term disability insurance
as you can afford, especially if you have a very specialized occupation that would
require you to take a significant pay cut in order to work in a different capacity.
However, if own-occupation disability insurance is cost prohibitive, having long-term
disability coverage that provides benefits if you’re unable to work at any job is better
than not having the coverage at all.
Worksheet 16-5 lists questions regarding key disability insurance features and benefits
that you should consider in order to evaluate your current disability insurance and
any additional coverage that you likely need to obtain.
If you need to purchase disability insurance, I recommend that you use this worksheet
to start your comparison shopping on the Web with sites such as www.insure.com
and www.insurancefinder.com/applications/app_healthdisability.html.
Also contact two or three independent insurance agents in your area that provide per-
sonal disability insurance. Compare all these policies — the features and benefits, as
well as the price — and select the one that best fits your personal situation.

Chapter 17
Figuring Out What Life Insurance
You Need
In This Chapter
 Getting to know the ins and outs of life insurance policies
 Calculating how much coverage you need
 Comparing policies and selecting the right one for you
L
ife insurance — in its pure form — is meant to replace your income in the event of pre-
mature death. If you’re married, in a committed relationship, or have children who
depend on your income, you need life insurance. If you have a stay-at-home spouse or part-
ner caring for your home and children, you would be faced with some very substantial costs
to replace those services in the event of his or her premature death. In this chapter, I illus-
trate how to determine how much life insurance you need, explore the types of policies avail-
able, and point out the features you should look for.
Evaluating Policies and Provisions
You have the following three primary types of life insurance to choose from, and each prod-
uct has its appropriate uses:
 Term: Like home or auto insurance, term insurance is pure insurance in that it pays off
only if you make a claim. The cost of the insurance can go up every year or remain
level for a specific number of years. You can lose your insurance coverage if the term
expires and the policy isn’t guaranteed renewable, or if you elect not to renew if you
have that option. However, term insurance is by far the cheapest form of life insurance,
and the only appropriate type of life insurance for most people.
Here are a few suggestions:
• Twenty-year level term coverage is generally an excellent option for families
with young children, whether or not they need a lot or a little insurance, because
the insurance will be there to support the surviving family, at least until the kids
are grown.
• I encourage you to consider level premium term life insurance coverage. (I’m a big
fan.) For one thing, the level premium guarantees that you know exactly how
much your insurance is going to cost for a set number of years. Another reason
I like level premium term life insurance is that it is extremely cost-effective. I would
like to see you use level premium term insurance with a guaranteed level premium
for the number of years that you anticipate needing the coverage and also con-
sider adding the guaranteed renewable rider.

A guaranteed renewable rider is a very attractive feature available with
many term insurance policies and assures that you will be able to retain a
term policy at the end of its initial term — if you still need the insurance —
simply by paying the premiums in effect at that time. You don’t have to reap-
ply or provide evidence of insurability. This provision provides great flexibil-
ity when you’re not exactly sure when you’ll no longer need coverage.
• If you need coverage for only five to ten years at most, you may want to
consider Annual Renewable Term (ART) life insurance because it tends to
be less expensive for the first five or six years of the policy, but every year
thereafter, the premiums continue to increase. The break-even point is so
early in the life of the Annual Renewable Term policy that it makes no sense
to buy this coverage unless you won’t need it very long. In every other situ-
ation where term insurance would be appropriate, go with the level pre-
mium term insurance.
Most people I’ve consulted with need at least $200,000 worth of life insurance, or
several times that amount, to provide for their surviving family in the event of
premature death, but they can’t afford spending thousands of dollars per year on
life insurance premiums. They need life insurance, but they only need the cover-
age for a limited period of time, so in this case, term insurance is the best fit.
 Permanent: With permanent life insurance, the cost is substantially higher in the
first several years of your coverage. However, the cost can’t go up. The initial
premium rate is as bad as it’ll ever get, and the insurance company can’t deny
you benefits as long as you pay your premiums on time. So, if you need life insur-
ance coverage forever — for example, if you need cash available for your heirs to
pay estate or inheritance taxes upon your death — you’re a good candidate for
permanent life insurance. Permanent insurance comes in two primary flavors:
• Universal: You may possibly need a lot of life insurance now and well into
your retirement years. If this is the case, universal life insurance is likely
the type of insurance for at least a portion of your life insurance need.
• Whole: If you need coverage for your entire life, no matter how long you
live, whole life insurance might be the right option for that portion of
your life insurance need.
Insurance agents make a lot more money selling universal life, variable universal life,
and whole life insurance than they do selling term insurance. This inherent conflict of
interest is something that you need to always keep in mind when considering the
recommendations of an insurance agent.
Determining How Much Coverage You Need
You may know the type of life insurance you need, but how do you know how much
coverage is best? To calculate how much life insurance you may need to support your
surviving family, check out Worksheets 17-1 and 17-2.
If you’re relatively healthy, term insurance is quite affordable, so if in doubt about the
appropriate amount of life insurance you need or for how long, I suggest buying as
much coverage as you can afford. You can generally drop a portion of your coverage
as time passes and you no longer need as much coverage as you did initially.
Worksheet 17-1 illustrates a precise way of determining how much life insurance you
may need. Worksheet 17-2 that follows this example provides you the opportunity to
calculate your personal life insurance needs. Complete Worksheet 17-2 for both you
and your spouse or partner to determine both of your life insurance needs.
216
Part V: Protecting Your Assets 

If one of you does not work outside the home, be sure to add to the monthly expenses
of the surviving family the cost to replace the stay-at-home parent’s financial contribu-
tions to the household.
Example: In the event of the death of a stay-at-home parent while young children are in
the home, you might need to hire a live-in nanny so that your children are well cared
for and you can continue to work outside the home as you have been. To hire the serv-
ices of a full-time nanny, you might need to spend $25,000 to $40,000 per year, for as
long as you need this level of service. Add this cost to the monthly expenses of the
surviving family on line 1 of Worksheet 17-2.

Chapter 17: Figuring Out What Life Insurance You Need

Say, for example, that your family needs a total of $800,000 of life insurance now if you
were to die, and you want to keep $200,000 worth of coverage for your spouse when he
or she reaches age 65 in 30 years. You’d like your spouse to have that coverage for the
rest of his or her life. You should then obtain a total of $600,000 in term insurance —
preferably 30-year-level term coverage or a 20-year-level term policy that is guaranteed
renewable. Then purchase a separate universal life policy to provide $200,000 for your
spouse that lasts until he or she is age 95 or stops paying premiums and depletes the
cash value.
Shopping Tips and Tactics
When it comes to shopping for life insurance, the Internet has leveled the playing field.
You once would’ve had to work directly with an insurance agent to obtain life insurance.
Nowadays, you can buy directly from an insurance company via many Internet-based
comparison shopping Web sites. I encourage you to do your initial comparison shopping
on the Web before contacting an agent or insurance company directly. Check out online
quote services such as www.insure.com, www.Insurance.com, or www.select
quote.com from an estimate of the cost to obtain the type of life insurance policy that
you need from a variety of competitive companies.
However, if you have any health problems or are taking any prescription medication, it
is in your best interest to work through an insurance agent rather than going directly
to an insurance company. For example, an agent knows which companies may be more
lenient regarding high blood pressure medication. You should apply only with compa-
nies who will be most amenable to your health considerations.
If you need or may benefit from permanent coverage, you should definitely work
directly with an insurance agent because permanent life insurance is actually quite
complex, and you’ll want to make sure that you get the professional guidance an insur-
ance professional can provide.
Check out the general insurance-buying tips in Chapter 15 and do your initial research
and comparison shopping online to become better informed about competitive rates
for various policies. Then contact at least three sources and allow each company to
provide you with quotes on a few different policies that may be best for your situation.
5. Based on the length of time your survivors need coverage and the cost of
 
insurance as illustrated in Step 3, what term or type of policy is best suited for 
 
your needs?

You can use Worksheet 17-4 as you comparison shop. As you question each company,
be sure to consider the following:
 How much life insurance you need

After you’ve done your research, the only thing left to do is to proceed with filing an
application with the most attractive policy for your personal situation. Be completely
honest on your application when you apply for new coverage. An insurance company
isn’t about to pay out tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on a death claim with-
out a very thorough investigation. If you fail to disclose any information asked for on
your insurance application, your survivor’s claim may be rejected.

H
omeowner’s and auto insurance policies are likely not the sexiest subjects that you’d
want to spend your time on. However, they’re two of the most critical areas that must
be covered to ensure financial success. Too often, families miss very simple key elements in
their homeowner’s and auto insurance coverages that leave them exposed to devastating
risks. Fortunately, it doesn’t take much time or money to fill these voids.
Covering Your Homestead
If you’re a homeowner, your house needs to be insured for a minimum of 80 percent of its
value (not counting the value of the land). However, many parts of the country have seen
extraordinary appreciation in home values over recent years, and if you purchased your
home several years ago, your home may be significantly underinsured.
For example: You purchased a home in 1995 for $300,000. If your home appreciated an aver-
age of 10 percent per year over the last 12 years, your home is worth over $940,000.
However, your homeowner’s insurance may have only increased through its automatic infla-
tion adjustments to less than one-half that amount.
You must be proactive and review your current homeowner’s coverage at least on an annual
basis to make certain that your insurance is sufficient to rebuild or repair your home if it is
destroyed. So, what do you need to be looking for during the annual review of your home-
owner’s policy? Worksheet 18-1 delves into the key components required to make sure that
you’re fully and adequately covered.
Before you dive into Worksheet 18-1, here are a few terms you need to know:
 Actual-cash-value coverage: If you have a policy that pays the actual cash value of
your home’s contents, you’ll get a check for what your stuff was worth before it was
destroyed — not what it would cost to replace your valued items.
 Declarations page(s): This one- to two-page annual statement you receive from your
insurance company each year outlines your coverages and your annual premium. Keep
it with your policy.

 Full replacement cost: If your property is destroyed, the insurance company is
obligated to fully replace or rebuild your property without any deduction for
depreciation. Obtaining full replacement cost on your personal property will
cost you only about 10 to 20 percent more than the actual-cash-value coverage.
Comprehensive homeowner’s coverage must include full replacement cost to
repurchase all the items in your home today if they’re lost, stolen, or destroyed.
 Guaranteed replacement cost: Even if the damage exceeds the limits on your
policy, the insurance company is obligated to fully replace or rebuild your prop-
erty without any deduction for depreciation. Guaranteed replacement policies
aren’t exactly what you might imagine. Insurers limit the amount that they pay
out to replace or rebuild your home to usually no more than 20 percent above
the amount for which your home is insured. (Note: If your home appreciates
beyond the level of coverage, the policy won’t cover that amount — even though
you thought you had guaranteed replacement coverage.)
Guaranteed replacement coverage doesn’t end with just the dwelling itself; you
must also think about the value of the contents of your home. The contents of my
“junk” drawer alone would cost more than $300 to replace. Now just imagine how
much more money it would take to replace all the items throughout your home.
Even if you try to obtain guaranteed replacement coverage on your home and all
its contents, you may not be able to secure guaranteed replacement coverage for
certain things. For example, the majority of homeowner’s insurance companies
don’t provide full replacement coverage for a roof damaged by hail or wind-
storms. Instead, the company depreciates it, which means that the insurance com-
pany assesses the damage and estimates the useful life of the roof prior to the
storm and pays only that portion. You have to come up with the balance of the
cost of a new roof. Nothing like thinking you’re fully insured only to discover that
you need to come up with $5,000 or $10,000 to apply toward a new roof immedi-
ately! Contact your homeowner’s insurance agent and ask her specifically what
items in and around your home will be replaced in their entirety or depreciated.
 Liability: This type of insurance helps protect you financially if someone is
injured by you on your property.
 Rider: A rider is really a separate insurance policy that goes with your home-
owner’s policy to insure special types of personal property. Items like electron-
ics, musical equipment, jewelry, and antiques are often covered only up to about
$2,000 in value. You must obtain a rider on your homeowner’s policy, for an addi-
tional cost, to fully insure these items. A copy of your purchase receipt and/or an
appraisal may be necessary to substantiate the value of the items covered under
each rider. The annual cost for this additional insurance is about $17 per $1,000
in coverage.
Worksheet 18-1
Insuring Your Home and Everything in It
1. Check with your insurer to verify these limits and enter that amount here ______%.
2. Calculate the current replacement cost of your home by doing the following:
a. Pull out a copy of the most recent declarations page that you’ve received from
your homeowner’s insurance provider.
b. Locate the amount listed as the property coverage for the dwelling. Enter that
amount here $_____________.
224
Part V: Protecting Your Assets 

c. Enter the approximate square footage of your house here ______________.
d. Divide the amount of coverage for the dwelling by the square footage of your
home (Line b ÷ Line c). Enter the total here. $_________.
e. Talk to a couple of custom homebuilders to determine an approximate price per
square foot to rebuild a home of similar quality. Be sure to let the custom home-
builder know about all the expensive improvements that you’ve done on your
home since it was initially purchased. Those granite countertops, finished rec
room, and the new master suite with Jacuzzi tub have definitely increased the
cost to rebuild your home.
Estimate the value of those enhancements and enter that amount here
$______________ per square foot.
You can also get an estimate online at www.accucoverage.com for $7.95 or for no
cost at www.building-cost.net. Enter the average result here $_____________.
f. Multiply Line e by Line c to determine the replacement cost. Enter the result
here $_________________.
g. Contact your homeowner’s insurance agent and increase the value of your
dwelling to no less than 100 percent of what it would cost to rebuild the same
quality home today. You will be surprised at how little your insurance premiums
will increase, and you can rest assured that your home now really does have
guaranteed-replacement coverage.
3. Take a detailed inventory of all the possessions in your home, including the con-
tents in the basement, garage, storage shed, and so on.
You want to make sure that you’re insured at a level that allows you to replace every-
thing that you need to resume life as you once knew it before your insurance claim.
A detailed written list, including brand names, makes, models, serial numbers, pur-
chase dates, and purchase prices, is helpful in case you need to substantiate an insur-
ance claim. Photographs and video recordings are extremely helpful for this purpose
as well. Keep this list, the photographs, and video recordings in your safety deposit
box. And don’t forget to update these records regularly.
Enter your guesstimate for how much money it would take to replace the contents of
your home here $__________.
Yes, I know this is a lot of work. But there is no other way to prove to the insurance
company that your stuff is worth squat without this kind of proof. Likely the easiest
option is to walk through and around your entire property with a camcorder and ver-
bally describe in intricate detail everything that is being viewed — floor to ceiling —
inside drawers and closets.
Even if you try to obtain guaranteed replacement coverage on all your contents and
your home, you may not be able to secure guaranteed replacement coverage for cer-
tain items. 
4. Review your insurance declarations pages and your policy, answer each of the
points concerning your existing coverage on your home and its contents, and
contact your homeowner’s insurance agent if you have questions.
225
Chapter 18: Insuring Your Property

Make sure that your home and its contents are properly covered according to your
estimates from Steps 2 and 3. Also, ask your agent to provide recommendations
regarding additional coverage or enhancements that he feels you should make at this
time — Worksheet 18-2 can help with this task. (Later in this chapter, I suggest how to
go about comparison shopping.)
Revisit this conversation with your insurance professional at least annually and contact
your homeowner’s insurance agent anytime your home (not including land) appreciates
beyond 100 percent of the dwelling coverage.
Review your declarations page and insurance page to discover what the liability limits
are on your policy in addition to the coverage. If you can’t find that information, con-
tact your agent.
Personal liability (each occurrence) $___________
Medical payments (each person) $___________
Although Worksheet 18-1 helps you cover the basics when it comes to making sure
that you have enough homeowner’s insurance, you may want to consider whether
your home falls under special circumstances that may require additional coverage. In
order to help you figure out whether you may need more coverage for special circum-
stances, go through the checklist in Worksheet 18-2. If any of these statements apply to
you, you should contact your insurance agent to make sure that you’re properly cov-
ered. Be scrupulously honest and extremely detailed with your current and any
prospective insurance agent so that she can best help you obtain adequate insurance
coverage.
Worksheet 18-2
Special Home Coverages Checklist
You may need additional coverage on your home if the following conditions apply:
 You operate a home-based business. If you haven’t told your insurance agent
about your business, you’re likely not covered for any activities involving the
business or your business equipment.
 You live with someone to whom you aren’t married and who isn’t on the deed
or title to the home. Your roomie’s possessions likely aren’t insured unless he
has a renter’s policy. Talk to your insurance agent about how to proceed.
 You may be exposed to water damage due to storm sewer or water backup. I
once had the mistaken assumption that because I lived on the top of the hill, my
home was not at risk for flood damage. During a period of heavy rain, my sump
pump malfunctioned, and I ended up with over a foot of water in my basement.
My homeowner’s policy did not cover any damage caused by this event. An addi-
tional coverage called sewer backup is necessary to provide protection under
this type of circumstance. Ever since that time, I have paid a very small amount
of additional premium to maintain storm drainage and sewer backup protection.
You should also consider maintaining this additional coverage if you have any-
thing of value on the lowest level of your home.
 You live in a flood zone or are in danger of incurring water damage from
other sources such as hurricanes. Water damage from hurricanes and storm
surges, as well as other types of flooding, aren’t covered by homeowner’s
226
Part V: Protecting Your Assets 

policies. For example, the massive destruction Hurricane Katrina caused was
almost all due to flooding. Even those people who had comprehensive home-
owner’s insurance policies may not have had flood insurance. They lost their
homes, and their insurance policies may not pay to replace them, because water
damage is not automatically covered.
The only way to obtain flood insurance is through the National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP) (www.floodsmart.gov/floodsmart/pages/index.jsp), and
the coverage isn’t available in some of the most high-risk areas. Contact the NFIP
or your homeowner’s agent to find out more.
 You’re at risk for windstorm damage. Do you live in a hurricane zone? Check to
see whether your homeowner’s policy has a windstorm deductible. This provi-
sion requires you to pay a portion of the damage to your property from wind cre-
ated by a hurricane. Windstorm deductibles are usually 1 to 5 percent of a
policy’s total value. For example, if your home is insured for $300,000 and you
have a windstorm deductible of 5 percent, you can be out of pocket $15,000
before the insurer pays anything.
 Your home is at risk of mold damage. Does your homeowner’s policy cover for
mold damage? Mold is becoming an epidemic in certain parts of the country. If
you have a mold problem, you may not be able to continue living in the house or
sell it, and many insurance companies are limiting the amount that they’re will-
ing to pay to fix the problem to $10,000.
 You live in or near an earthquake-prone area. You definitely should investigate
earthquake coverage. In certain high-risk areas, many people have concluded
that earthquake coverage is cost prohibitive. However, if you’re in a high-risk
area, can you afford to be without earthquake coverage? By the way, do you
know one of the most significant earthquakes in this country occurred in the
Midwest? Are you sure that you’re not at risk for an earthquake? Can you afford
to be wrong? If not, buy the coverage.
Shopping for the right homeowner’s policy
If you’re currently shopping for insurance for a new home, or if you haven’t done any
comparison shopping in a long time, you should spend a little time finding out what
the marketplace has to offer. I don’t advocate switching insurance companies unless
you don’t have a quality, competitive policy; however, you want to make certain that
you’re receiving quality coverage at a cost-effective price.
Also keep in mind that insurers reward loyalty. If you’ve been a loyal customer with the
same insurance company for 10 or 20 years, you’re less likely to be dropped or see a
drastic increase in your premium in the event of a legitimate claim than if you’d been
with the company for only one or two years.
My personal favorite place to begin my research is at J.D. Power and Associate’s Web
site at www.jdpower.com/insurance/ratings/homeowners_insurance/index.asp.
This site provides an annual National Homeowner’s Insurance Study and ranks compa-
nies based on customers’ ratings in the following categories:
 Overall experience
 Policy offerings
 Pricing
 Contacting (interacting with) the insurer
227
Chapter 18: Insuring Your Property

To do some research and compare policies on your own, obtain premium quotes from
different insurance companies. Be careful to compare policies with identical features
and benefits. You want to look for the financially strongest companies, with great
claims payments history, where you can obtain all the required and desired coverages
for the best price.
Saving money on your homeowner’s policy
Not looking forward to spending so much of your hard-earned cash on your home-
owner’s policy? Don’t worry — I’m here to help you with some money-saving tips.
Insurance companies often offer discounts on your homeowner’s insurance if you
qualify in certain categories, or you may be able to adjust your deductible to make
ends meet.
If you’re considering lowering your deductible (the part you pay before your insurance
policy kicks in), keep in mind that insurance is intended to cover risks that you can’t
afford to bear on your own. The higher the deductible, the lower the premium. By rais-
ing your deductibles to $1,000 from $250, you may be able to reduce your premium by
as much as 25 to 30 percent. Just make sure that you don’t raise your deductible so
high that you can’t pay that amount in case of an emergency.
Ask yourself the following important questions, which may save you money on your
homeowner’s insurance:
 Are your home, auto, and liability insurance policies with the same company?
And if not, would you be willing to change in order to save you money?
I don’t necessarily recommend changing insurers that you have a long-term
history with. In insurance, cost is only one of the major factors to consider.
 Do you have any safety devices (smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, sprinkler
systems, alarm systems, and so on) in your home?
 How long have you maintained coverage with the same insurance company?
 Have you made any mechanical or structural upgrades to your home?
 In an emergency, could you comfortably afford to pay your deductible if you
raised it?
If you answered Yes to any of these questions, contact your current or prospective
insurance company to see whether you can save yourself a little bit o’ money, while
obtaining top quality and adequate insurance coverage. Be sure to also ask the insur-
ance agent whether any other discounts are available to which you may be entitled.
Acquiring Coverage for Your Car
If you drive, you need to have auto insurance coverage (no contest). But just exactly
which type of coverages should you have, and which ones are you required to have?
The following are the key features of auto insurance (depending on your unique cir-
cumstances you may or may not need all these features; I talk about this more later in
this section):
228
Part V: Protecting Your Assets 

 Collision: If you’re in an automobile accident, regardless of who is at fault, colli-
sion insurance provides protection to replace or repair your vehicle, subject to a
deductible.
 Comprehensive: In the event of hail damage or a tree limb falling on your car
(risks not involving an automobile collision), this coverage insures you.
Comprehensive coverage pays to repair your vehicle, subject to a separate
deductible.
 Personal injury protection: This type of insurance coverage is for medical and
other expenses resulting from an automobile accident for the people specified in
the policy, regardless of who is at fault in the accident.
 Medical payments: This feature provides a limited amount of coverage for you
and your passengers’ medical expenses as a result of an accident. The coverage
pays regardless of who is at fault.
 Bodily injury and property damage liability coverage: The insurer agrees to
pay damages if you injure someone or his property in an auto accident.
 Uninsured and underinsured motorists liability coverage: If you’re in an acci-
dent with another driver who doesn’t carry any or enough liability coverage,
uninsured or underinsured motorists liability coverage allows you to collect
damages that you personally experience from the accident.
Worksheet 18-3 lists commonly recommended limits and deductibles for the various
coverages involved in basic auto policies.

however, the limit is likely less.)
Underinsured motorists
$100,000
Because states differ in regulations and because you may have unique circumstances,
you may need more or less coverage than what I describe in Worksheet 18-3. For state-
by-state regulations on required coverages, visit http://info.insure.com/auto/
minimum.html. Also consider the following before deciding on what coverage you need:
229
Chapter 18: Insuring Your Property

 Increasing your liability limits and your deductibles may be appropriate for you
if you have cash reserves. The additional liability coverage raises your premium;
however, increasing your deductibles helps offset those additional costs. In fact,
increasing your deductible from $250 to $500 could reduce your collision and
comprehensive coverage premium by 15 to 30 percent. Going up to a $1,000
deductible could save you about 40 percent.
You buy insurance to cover big financial risks. If you’re involved in a major acci-
dent and cars are totaled, people are injured or killed, and property is damaged,
the total financial impact could be hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of
dollars. The liability benefits on your automobile policy help to protect you
from this financial devastation. You can’t afford to skimp on liability coverage.
 If you have a much older vehicle or drive your vehicles until they drop, a time
will come when maintaining collision and comprehensive insurance coverages
isn’t financially worthwhile. A general guideline is to drop collision and compre-
hensive coverage on vehicles worth less than ten times the cost for that portion
of your auto policy.
For example, in reviewing your declaration page, you see that the premium on
the collision and comprehensive portions of your automobile insurance policy
total approximately $220 a year. Ten times $220 equals $2,200. If your car is
worth less than $2,200, you should seriously consider dropping your collision
and comprehensive insurance coverages.
Don’t drop your liability coverages under any circumstance — your old clunker
can still wreak havoc in an accident. Besides, your state law probably requires that
you maintain liability insurance. And like the money savvy person you are, you
wouldn’t want to put yourself and your family in this kind of financial jeopardy.
To review your current auto coverage, you can use Worksheet 18-4, which outlines the
key features of auto policies and provides you the opportunity to indicate whether you
have this coverage and how much coverage you currently have. This info becomes
very useful when comparing policy provisions, recommended enhancements, and
other policies when shopping around.

The more you know about auto insurance and how the industry works, the better off
you will be, and the more money you can save. The following are key factors that car
insurers use to determine the price of your auto insurance and what you can do to
keep it as low as possible:
230
Part V: Protecting Your Assets 

 Age: If you’re very young or quite elderly, your risk of being in an auto accident
is statistically much higher than for middle-aged folks. You can’t do anything
about your age. However, some insurers may penalize you less than others with
regard to your cost of insurance.
 Auto insurance claims history: Safe drivers are rewarded with lower auto insur-
ance premiums. Your history of making claims against your auto policy will
directly affect the cost of your insurance. The more you use insurance, the more
your insurance will cost.
 Commuting distance to work: Face it — getting on the road is dangerous. The
farther you drive, the higher your risk of being in an accident.
 Credit history: Insurance companies have determined that there is a direct 
correlation between your credit history and your risk as a driver. I guess they figure
that if you’re careless with your credit, then you may be careless in your driving —
just one more reason why improving and continuing to maintain good credit is
essential to your financial health. (For more on your credit, see Chapter 5.)
 Driving record: If you have received a traffic ticket for speeding or another form
of reckless driving, you’ll pay for that carelessness in higher insurance premiums.
 Marital status: Married people historically are more stable drivers.
 Place of residence: Your zip code can have a drastic effect on your cost of insur-
ance. Certain zip codes have a history for more auto theft, vandalism, and so on,
and the insurance companies are still allowed to penalize you for living in these
zip codes.
 Type of car you drive: A Dodge Dart station wagon versus a Hummer or a
Corvette? The latter two will pay substantially higher auto insurance premiums
because those cars will cause or potentially receive much more damage in the
same accident as the Dodge station wagon, and they cost a lot more to repair or
replace than the older, less expensive vehicle. Also, drivers of sports cars statis-
tically drive more carelessly then drivers of sedans. Careless driving causes acci-
dents. Accidents result in claims. Claims result in higher insurance costs.
Don’t go with the first auto insurance policy you run across or switch insurances just
for the sake of switching (remember that insurers value loyalty). However, shopping
around and doing some snooping around can pay off.
1. Begin your research at J.D. Power and Associates at www.jdpower.com/
insurance/ratings/auto_insurance/index.asp, which provides customer
ratings for many insurance companies.
2. Have a copy of Worksheets 18-3 and 18-4 available so that you know exactly
what you have and need from your auto insurance coverage.
3. Get at least three competitive quotes directly from some of these highly rated
companies as well as one or two independent agents who represent many
insurance companies and can perform some comparison shopping for you. 
You can find an agent in your area through the Independent Insurance Agents
and Brokers of America at www.iiaba.net/agentlocator/findagent.aspx.
Using Worksheet 18-5, you can enter all of the results from your comparison shopping.
Be sure to always compare apples to apples.

Part V: Protecting Your Assets 

_________ What would your premium be if you raised your deductible even further? 
_________ To what level could you comparably afford to raise your deductible? 
Here are some tips to help you save money on your auto insurance:
 Don’t file small claims. The more you use your insurance, the higher your pre-
mium rates will be. Higher premiums mean that the insurance company will
make money on you. That’s a good thing. If you made money on the insurance
company, you must have been involved in a horrible accident. Submitting claims
that exceed your deductible by just a few hundred dollars doesn’t make financial
sense. You won’t come out ahead if you file small or frequent claims; paying for
smaller losses yourself can save you money over the long term.
The insurance company is in business to make money. Use your insurance to
protect you only from devastating financial losses.
 Don’t let other people drive your vehicle. Multiple drivers create multiple risks.
More risk, more cost of insurance.
 Wear your seatbelt. Studies prove more people survive accidents and receive
less severe injuries because they wear their seatbelts. Less injury, less insurance
claim, less cost of insurance.
 Drive the speed limit. Speeders cause accidents. Accidents result in claims.
Claims jack up your cost of insurance.
 Take a driver safety course. Many companies provide a discount to drivers who
have taken a safe driving course.
 Practice defensive-driving techniques. Fewer accidents. Fewer claims. Cheaper
insurance rates.
 Continue to improve your credit score. For more info, see Chapter 5.
 Pay your auto insurance premium annually. Most companies charge a service
fee if you pay your premiums monthly, quarterly, and sometimes semiannually.
 Before buying a vehicle, check out its insurance safety rating through
Consumer Reports. You can find this info at www.consumerreports.org if
you’re a subscriber.
Adding to Your Liability Protection
In addition to the liability coverages that you have through your homeowner’s and
auto insurance policies (see previous sections), you very likely should also have an
umbrella liability policy, which is additional liability insurance added on top of the
other coverages, and covers attorney’s fees for claims arising from your nonbusiness
activities. If you have any assets to protect, liability insurance is a must. Thank good-
ness it doesn’t cost much.
Umbrella liability insurance is generally sold in increments of $1 million. General guide-
lines state that you should have one to two times the value of your assets in liability
insurance. To figure out how much liability insurance you need, guestimate your net
worth and then round up to the nearest $1 million.
Fortunately, the cost of this coverage is fairly reasonable. You can obtain a $1 million
umbrella liability coverage for less than $150 per year. Contact the agent who provides
your homeowner’s and auto coverage for more information.

dentity theft has become the fastest-growing crime in America. You may think it won’t
happen to you, but it’s happening to nearly 1 million Americans every single year — and
the trend is growing. If you’re a victim of identity theft, clearing your good name could take
you months, if not years, and tens of thousands of dollars. And meanwhile, you can’t get

against this growing epidemic of identity theft.

Worksheet 19-1
Keys to Protecting Your Financial Privacy
❏Reduce solicitations — especially through the mail, which is only fodder for
thieves. For tips on how to do so, see the section “Utilizing the Do Not Call and
Do Not Solicit Policies” later in this chapter.
❏Lock your mailbox — one quick and easy solution to keep sticky fingers out of
your personal info. The postal carriers can deposit mail into the box, but no one
can make a withdrawal without having the key. Consider taking your outgoing
mail to the post office directly or to a U.S. Postal Service depository mailbox,
which you can find just about anywhere.
❏Have your payroll check, pension, or Social Security checks automatically
deposited into your bank account so that thieves can’t get a hold of any hard
copies, acid-wash your name off the checks, and cash them for themselves.
❏Shred all paperwork containing any personal information before discarding,
including any document containing any of the following information:
• your name
• date of birth
• address
• Social Security number
• account numbers
• account statements
• checks
• bills
• paycheck stubs
Prior to discarding any of these documents, keep them in a safe place, such as a
locked file cabinet.
❏Don’t give out any personal information to anyone you don’t know — either in
person or on the phone — unless you initiated the contact or can validate that
that she actually is employed by the company that she’s representing. If in
doubt, don’t give it out the information!
❏If possible, use a landline phone when providing private financial information
over the telephone. Identity thieves can gain access to your private financial
information by eavesdropping on your conversations taking place on cellular or
cordless telephones.
❏Carefully protect all user IDs, password information, and personal identification
numbers. Never carry this information in your wallet and don’t save this type of
information on your computer or on any Web site. (For more on online safety,
see the section “Protecting Yourself from Identity Thieves,” later in this chapter.)
❏Never have anything printed on your banking account checks, such as your
Social Security number, phone number, and so on, that isn’t required.
❏Don’t allow your Social Security number to be used as your participant number,
user ID, username, or login name on anything. Frequently, group health compa-
nies use a Social Security number as your employee ID number. Call your insur-
ers or your human resources department at work and request a new employee
ID number and insurance card.
236
Part V: Protecting Your Assets 

❏If you carry a purse (or man-purse), don’t let it out of your sight. Hang it on the
back of your chair or place it on the floor next to your chair at a restaurant.
These same rules apply to laptop computers!
❏If or when you dispose of a computer, erase the hard drive first! You may want
to use a product like Disk Wipe, which is available at www.dtidata.com/
disk_wipe.htm.
Don’t think that all thieves are strangers. In more than half of all reported identity theft
cases, the thief turned out to be a coworker, family member, or friend.
Monitoring Your Credit Report
Obtain copies of your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus and
review them carefully at least once each year. Most people discover that their identity
has been stolen only when they go to apply for credit and are denied. Then they obtain
a copy of their credit report and discover all kinds of activities that aren’t theirs.
Don’t wait to be denied credit to review your credit report. Regular monitoring of your
credit report and following the safety tips I share in this chapter are the best ways to
protect yourself. Refer to Chapter 5 for additional information on monitoring your credit.
Utilizing the Do Not Call and Do Not Solicit
Policies
You have to spend some time now to save time over the long-run, save trees, and pro-
tect your privacy. You can follow the steps outlined in Worksheet 19-2 to reduce the
majority of your junk mail, telephone solicitations, and spam. Unfortunately, compa-
nies that already have your personal and private information are allowed by law
to give or sell it to others unless you expressly tell them not to do so. You can use
Worksheet 19-3 to express your unwillingness to let anyone give out or sell your
information.
Worksheet 19-2
Minimizing Solicitations
❏Add your name and phone number to the National Do-Not-Call Registry online at
www.donotcall.gov or by calling 888-382-1222.
❏Contact the Direct Marketing Association and get removed from their solicitation
lists too. Here’s the DMA’s contact info for the different types of solicitations:
• Mail: Mail Preference Service, P.O. Box 643, Carmel, NY 10512; Web site
www.dmaconsumers.org/cgi/offmailing
• E-mail: Web site www.dmaconsumers.org/offemaillist.html
237
Chapter 19: Protecting Your Privacy

❏Contact the major credit bureaus and opt out of receiving preapproved credit
offers sent to you. Go online to www.optoutprescreen.com or call 888-5OPT-
OUT (888-567-8688). Or your can write the three major credit bureaus and tell
them that you don’t want personal information about you shared for any promo-
tional purposes. (This step reduces the number of unsolicited credit card and
loan offers coming to you in the mail and thwarts would-be thieves who’d love to
get their hands on one of your pre-approved credit card offers.)
• Equifax, Options, P.O. Box 740123, Atlanta, GA 30374
• Experian, Consumer Opt-Out, 701 Experian Parkway, Allen, TX 75013
• TransUnion, Name Removal Option, P.O. Box 505, Woodlyn, PA 19094
❏Also write all companies with which you do business (your utility companies,
your bank, your credit-card company, insurance companies, lenders, and so on)
and specifically tell them not to sell or share your personal and private informa-
tion with anyone, including their affiliate companies. If you don’t proactively opt
out, these companies can (and do) sell or share your personal information with
others. (Refer to the sample letter in Worksheet 19-3.)
Worksheet 19-3 is a form letter that you can use to notify the major credit bureaus and
all the companies with which you do business that under no circumstance do you want
your personal and private information sold to or shared with anybody. Send your per-
sonal equivalent of this letter to all people and companies with which you do business
who may have any of your private information. Examples are folks like the following:
 Your life insurance agent and his company
 Your local bank
 Your credit-card companies
 Other lenders you may have
 Any company with which you have investments
 Any company from which you receive one of those mandatory Privacy Policy let-
ters or brochures at least once a year, most likely written with legal mumbo
jumbo and in the tiniest print possible.
It takes some time, but you can drastically reduce the amount of unwanted solicita-
tions, unauthorized inquiries regarding your credit history, junk mail in your mailbox,
spam in your e-mail box, and computer viruses. In short, you’ll be a difficult person for
identity thieves to victimize.

 Carry as few credit cards as necessary in your wallet — one or two should be
plenty!
 Use your credit cards only with companies and service providers with which
you regularly do business. Use cash in all other situations or secure online bill-
payment options, when possible.
 Scrutinize each entry on your credit-card statements when you receive them to
make certain that all transactions are ones that you initiated or authorized.
Online access makes checking out your credit-card accounts much easier. With
just a few clicks of the mouse, you can see exactly what has been charged on
your card, where, and when. You can also make your payments just as easily.
Contact your credit-card companies to establish online access to your accounts.
 Keep a list of the entire contents of your wallet, including a copy of the front and
back of each item and the company’s phone number, in a  safe place. Just in case
your wallet is lost or stolen, you’ll need to notify each company immediately. If
available, ask for a freeze on your account until further notice from you.
Protecting Yourself from Identity Thieves
Identity thieves have gotten increasingly more sophisticated by using e-mail and Web
sites to take your personal and financial information. The following are a few common
ways that thieves may try to steal your info:
 You receive an e-mail saying that you have won a prize, and all you need to do to
collect is complete a brief questionnaire about your personal information and
request a check for a processing fee. But these scammers don’t intend to send you
a prize at all. (Surprise is a better word for it!) Instead, they will cash or acid-wash
the check and continue using your private information.
 You get an e-mail in your inbox asking for personal information, from what
appears to be a legitimate source, such as a national bank or a major corpora-
tion, needing to verify its records (for an example, check out Worksheet 19-4).
However, if the inquiry was truly legitimate, the company would already know
the information that it’s requesting from you.
Bottomline: Don’t reply to these types of e-mails! That is exactly what the thieves want
you to do. And if the e-mail contains a link to a Web site, don’t clickthrough to the site.
Instead, send the e-mail to your spam or junk-mail folder. For more ways to avoid being
scammed online, check out the following guidelines:
 Never open attachments or click on links in e-mails from people or companies you
don’t know. Don’t worry — if the e-mail is truly legit, that person will contact you
again.
 Don’t fill out any forms contained in an e-mail from someone you don’t know or a
company you don’t do business with. Never fill out forms from any pop-up ads.

 Use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols in your online passwords.
These passwords are much harder for a hacker to crack.
 Consider using computer software that keeps all your online password and user-
name information in one safe, secure place. I recommend using RoboForm.
Download this software from www.roboform.com and load it onto a USB jump
drive so that you can remove the device and take it with you for use on other
computers, such as a laptop or a shared computer. The software costs about
$40, and you’ll never have to remember the Web address, login information, or
your passwords to log onto any Web site that you use. You simply need to
remember one super-secret password to access your RoboForm information (so
don’t write down or tell anyone your super-secret password and don’t make it
obvious).
 When shopping online, make sure that the URL shows https (rather than the tra-
ditional http) when you’re in the section of the Web site asking for credit-card or
personal information needed to complete the transaction. The s stands for a
secure site.
 Use antivirus software, such as AVG or Norton, and use antispam software such
as Comodo AntiSpam (www.comodoantispam.com), which requires senders to
verify themselves, or Mailwasher Pro, which analyzes each e-mail as it arrives
and warns you if it’s suspected junk mail or a virus using advanced logic and fil-
tering. You can find out more about Mailwasher Pro at http://firetrust.com/

Renewing Your Privacy Protection
Unfortunately, all the protective measures I outline in the previous sections don’t last a
lifetime. You’d think that if you asked to have your name removed from a mailing list,
you wouldn’t have to make this request again a few years later. Unfortunately, that’s
just not true.
You have to renew these rights periodically. Table 19-1 illustrates how often you need
to revisit your privacy protection and helps you keep track of when your renewal is
due and when you’ve completed it.

 Figuring out how financial advisors work and get paid
 Understanding the alphabet soup of credentials
 Knowing when you may need to hire an advisor
 Discovering how to interview and select an advisor
P
ersonal Finance Workbook For Dummies provides you with the tools and information
you need to become a savvy personal financial manager. However, you may have
occasions when you need to work with financial services people to obtain a mortgage or
a business or school loan or to purchase real estate, securities, or insurance products.
Obtaining guidance from a professional financial advisor may also be necessary and
appropriate at times.
However, any swindler, idiot with a good heart, or PhD in financial planning with decades
of practical and professional advisory experience can call himself a financial advisor.
Fortunately, the majority of the people in financial services aren’t crooks or idiots. But you
need to know about the extreme differences regarding how financial advisors work and get
paid, as well as how they are acquired, their training, experience, credentials, expertise, and
integrity.
This chapter helps you recognize when you may need a financial advisor and empowers you
to make the wisest decisions possible when searching for and selecting financial services
professionals. 
Identifying How Financial Advisors 
Work and Get Paid
One initial way to differentiate between financial advisors is by examining how they’re paid,
which tells you a lot about how they work and what type of work they do (and don’t do).
All people in the financial services industry, which include financial planners and advisors,
get paid in one of the following four ways:
 Commission only: Some advisors receive only commissions for selling financial services
products such as investments, real estate, insurance products, or loans. Examples
include advisors affiliated with companies like State Farm, American Family, and Edward
Jones. Your auto insurance agent, the municipal bond salesman, a mortgage broker, or
real estate agent are all examples of financial services professionals who are compen-
sated on a commission-only basis.

 Commission and fees: Most personal financial planners are paid this way. A com-
monly misunderstood term used to describe this compensation method is fee-
based. Examples include registered representatives of companies like Lincoln
Financial Advisors, Ameriprise, AIG Financial Advisors, Wachovia, UBS, and
Merrill Lynch. Commission and fee advisors may receive a fee for developing a
financial plan for you and then receive commissions when they sell you insur-
ance and investment products recommended in your financial plan.
 Salary plus bonuses: Many discount brokerage firms and banks compensate
their employees with a base salary plus incentive pay for bringing in new client
accounts (money) into the institution. They may receive substantially higher
bonuses by recommending or selling certain products and services over other
options.
 Fee-only: Fee-only financial advisors provide advice or ongoing management and
aren’t registered representatives of any financial services company. They’re typi-
cally self-employed Registered Investment Advisors (RIA) or employees of this
type of firm. All their compensation is paid directly by you, the client. How much
they charge is painfully obvious to the client.
One benefit often cited regarding fee-only financial advisors is that they have no
financial stake in the recommendations they may provide for you. They recom-
mend only what they believe is in your best interest. This compensation method
does remove many inherent conflicts of interest regarding how the advisor is
paid. However, it does not ensure that the advice is rendered by an ethical or
competent financial advisor.
All financial professionals deserve to be compensated fairly for the advice or products
they provide, and you can find competent, ethical financial advisors working under
each of these compensation methods. The only thing that should matter to you is
whether you’re receiving what you really need from a competent professional and at a
competitive price. How do you know which advisor under which compensation model
is most appropriate for your needs?
If you’re looking for a house, a mortgage, a municipal bond, or auto or homeowners
insurance, you’ll likely need to work directly with a person who is compensated on a
commission-only basis.
The most popular form of compensation for personal financial advisors and planners
is currently a combination of commissions and fees. These financial advisors may be
affiliated with a large brokerage firm or insurance company, or they may be registered
representatives with an independent broker-dealer. They must maintain licenses to sell
securities, life insurance products, and annuities. Often, the majority of their compen-
sation comes from the sale of the products they recommend. However, they may also
provide financial planning services and advice for a separate hourly fee, flat fee, or
retainer fee.
Planners who charge only fees (similar to attorneys) often make a similar income as
well. Attorneys typically get paid in one of three ways:
 Hourly fee: You pay for all the time that the attorney works on your case or
spends with you. Multiply the time spent by the attorney’s hourly charge, and
that’s how much your fee is.
 Flat fee: Some attorneys charge flat fees for a package of services, such as draw-
ing up a living trust package.
244
Part V: Protecting Your Assets 

 Contingency fee: You pay only if you win your case. The lawyer may invest
hours or months on your case and incur lots of expenses trying to help you win
your case — and if you don’t, he is out his money and time. Your fee under a con-
tingency arrangement is based on a percentage of the amount you win — com-
monly a third of your award is paid to the attorney.
Fee-only financial advisors charge
 Hourly fee: You pay for all the time that the financial advisor works on your case
or spends with you. Multiply the time spent by the advisor’s hourly charge, and
that’s how much your fee is. Always find out the expected cost and the maximum
cost before you begin working with an advisor who charges by the hour.
Hourly-based pricing is best for:
• People who need specific advice about one or a few financial topics.
• Do-it-yourselfers who want a professional to give them his opinions.
• People who are comfortable taking on part of the legwork. They want 
to do as much as possible to save money, but want expert analysis and
direction.
• People who recognize a need for professional advice on occasion, but don’t
need, or want to pay the price for, a full-time financial advisor.
 Flat fee: Some financial advisors offer flat fees for a package of services, such as
analyzing whether you’re saving enough for retirement and investing in the right
places. Flat-fee pricing is best for people who need specific advice or services
and are willing to take the gamble that the flat-fee arrangement will cost no more
than it would have if they paid by the hour.
 Retainer fee: This fee isn’t exactly like a contingency fee — you’re definitely
going to have to pay for this service, unlike in a lawsuit where you could win or
lose. However, the retainer fee is often calculated based on a percentage of some
sort, such as 1 percent of the assets the advisor manages for you, or some per-
centage of your net worth or income, or mixture of the two. Retainer fees are
also computed by estimating the amount of time required to provide the serv-
ices promised, based on the complexity of the case and the skills required of the
advisor, for the time covered under agreement to retain the advisor.
A retainer fee is best suited for people who need, want, or can afford to transfer
the responsibility of managing their personal financial affairs to a financial advisor.
Deciphering What All the Initials,
Credentials, and Licenses Mean to You
Before you engage any financial advisor, you want to know a lot more about her back-
ground and experience and what her licenses or credentials mean for you.
Licenses are required by law for any financial services professionals who sell invest-
ments, insurance, or financing products. Common licenses you may see financial
planners or advisors hold include the following:
245
Chapter 20: Finding and Hiring the Right Advisor (If You Need One)

 Securities licenses are licenses to sell investments and include the following:
• Series 6: Licensed to sell mutual funds, variable annuities, and variable life
insurance.
• Series 7: In addition to the items covered under the Series 6, licensed to
sell individual stocks, bonds, and option contracts.
 Insurance licenses are licenses to sell insurance products and are broken down
into the following two categories:
• Life and health: Licensed to sell life, disability, medical, and long-term-care
insurance products.
• Property and casualty: Licensed to sell auto, homeowner’s, and liability
insurance.
A Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) isn’t a license, nor a credential, but a legal
requirement of anyone claiming to be a financial advisor. The only way around this law
is for the advisor to affiliate with a broker-dealer and become a registered representa-
tive of that broker (who must himself be an RIA). The federal or state Securities and
Exchange Commissioners regulate RIAs. The advisor’s business activities and records
may be audited by the regulators at any time.
You may also meet advisors with a lot of initials after their names, but what do these
initials tell you about their educational backgrounds and why is it important to you?
You can find no less than 70 different professional designations listed on the National
Association of Securities Dealers’ (NASD) Investor Education site at http://apps.
nasd.com/DataDirectory/1/prodesignations.aspx. However, for your benefit,
I feel compelled to narrow down the list drastically to the most significant and applica-
ble professional designations held by personal financial planners and advisors, which
you can find in Worksheet 20-1.
You should look at professional designations only as a sign of the advisor’s initial and
ongoing educational and examination requirements. Professional designations in no
way ensure that an advisor is competent or trustworthy, but they’re a start. In the next
section, you can explore some interview questions that can help discover additional
information you want to know about any prospective advisor, including his core com-
petencies and potential conflicts of interest.

colleges and universities now offer bachelor’s and master’s degrees as well as a few
PhD programs in personal financial planning. A bachelor’s degree in personal financial
planning provides the student with a good background. However, you should focus
more on someone who has also obtained one of the general personal financial planning
designations (refer to Worksheet 20-1), or a master’s or PhD degree in personal finan-
cial planning.
Interviewing and Selecting Your
Personal Financial Advisor
When choosing a financial advisor, I recommend that savvy consumers interview a few
different financial advisors to learn more about each one’s background, experience, spe-
cialties, target clientele, as well as his or her listening skills and communication styles.
Worksheet 20-2 is designed to assist you in interviewing financial advisors of any type.
When seeking out a financial advisor, first send this Financial Advisor Interview
Questionnaire, review each advisor’s responses, and then visit with two or three
prospective advisors over the telephone. After you’ve identified those advisors who may
best fit your needs, ask for a no-obligation get-acquainted meeting and meet with them
in person before you make a commitment or sign any contracts.
You may obtain an electronic version of this questionnaire at http://www.garrett
planningnetwork.com/files/Financial%20Advisor%20Interview%20Questionn
aire.pdf. Consider mailing or e-mailing this questionnaire to prospective financial
advisors prior to meeting with them for the first time, which saves both you and
the advisor considerable time.

The questions in Worksheet 20-2 are designed to help you get to know a lot more
about a prospective financial advisor prior to meeting with him or speaking with
him on the telephone. If an advisor refuses to complete this questionnaire, that
says a lot about his attitude or his schedule. In that event, continue on with other
advisors who will comply with this request.
Here are a few more general guidelines as you go about your search for the right
financial advisor:
 Some of the most revealing things you can find out about a financial advisor
have to do with why he got into financial planning or advisory services in
the first place. An individual that has a sincere and deep passion to serve
others may be exactly the type of advisor for whom you’re looking. Many
financial advisors have personally lived through life events that you may be
experiencing, and their personal insight could be extremely valuable to you,
and it’s very hard to gain through book knowledge.
 Another key question isn’t just how an advisor is compensated, but how
much that advisor will be compensated if you are to work with him. You can’t
compare advisors’ services and prices without getting this kind of detail.
And, don’t forget about conflicts of interest related to compensation. If an
advisor makes $1,000 recommending one strategy or investment and $5,000
recommending another, there is a conflict of interest. You should be fully
aware of how this conflict can affect an advisor’s recommendations, and
make sure that the option that would provide the advisor more money is
really the best option for you.
 Make sure that any advisor you choose views you as her target client. In
other words, will she be proud and honored to have you as a client? If you
happen to be someone who just barely makes her minimum requirements or
she’s made special arrangements or waived her minimums to accommodate
you, sooner or later, you may find that you aren’t getting the attention and
personal service that you need and deserve.

 Many financial advisors, especially independent, veteran advisors, and fee-only
advisors, require minimums. Those minimums may be the size of your invest-
ment account, your income or net worth, or the annual revenues you generate
for the advisor. If you’re a do-it-yourselfer or you’re looking for a second opinion
or one-time review, you very likely won’t qualify for many of these advisors’ mini-
mum requirements. It’s best to ask that up-front (when you receive their com-
pleted interview questionnaires or first speak with them) before you waste any
more of your own time or theirs.
Be sure to obtain a written contract from the advisor you select, outlining exactly what
the financial advisor will provide for you, how much the services will cost in total,
what you must provide to get this work completed, and when you will receive the final
product.
Always ask a lot of questions. Get a second opinion anytime it feels appropriate. And
don’t ever turn over control of your financial future to anybody and then just forget
about it. You should always review your account statements and never grant custody
over your money. Your advisor can have the right to place trades within your account,
or even have his fee withdrawn from your account; however, he doesn’t need custody
of your money.

A
For Dummies book wouldn’t be complete without
The Part of Tens. In this part, I highlight easy ways
you can trim your budget, get your finances organized,
and avoid getting ripped off.

Chapter 21
Ten Easy Ways to Trim Your Budget
In This Chapter
 Finding ways to save a buck or two
 Discovering fun ways to entertain (or be entertained) on a shoestring
W
ant some easy ways to save some money or free up some cash for more important
goals? The easiest way to trim your budget or spend less money is to direct the
money to where it would do you the most good before you have the opportunity to spend it.
However, there are many simple ways that you can scrape up a bit of extra cash each month
without even putting a damper on your lifestyle. I show you how in this chapter.
Take Full Advantage of Your Employer’s
Matching Contribution
Contribute the maximum amount that your employer will match in your retirement plan at
work. You’re basically receiving free money from your company! If your employer doesn’t make
a matching contribution, then you better check out the other suggestions in this chapter.
Max Out Your Roth IRA Contribution
If you have a Roth IRA and are eligible, make the maximum contributions to your and your
spouse’s Roth IRA accounts each year, but save monthly. For example, the maximum allow-
able contribution for 2007 is $4,000 per person if you’re under 50 years of age and $5,000 per
person if you’re 50 or older. Those contributions work out to be $333 per month and $416
per month respectively.
If you don’t already have a Roth IRA, you could use a no-load mutual fund company, such as
T. Rowe Price, or a discount broker, such as Scottrade, to establish your Roth IRA account,
because they have very low initial-investment minimums and even lower subsequent invest-
ment minimums. (For more on Roth IRAs, check out Chapter 14.)
When you establish your new mutual fund or brokerage account or if you don’t already 
have automatic withdrawal with your existing IRA, complete an application signing up for
the automatic monthly investment program. This feature sets up an automatic draft from
your checking account directly into your Roth IRA account each and every month. Your
Roth contribution gets funded automatically — before you have a chance to spend your
income on something else.

Build Your Personal Portfolio
Start or add to your personal portfolio by utilizing low-cost, tax-advantaged passive
investment vehicles, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and index funds. Index funds
have been available through mutual fund powerhouses like Vanguard for decades.
However, the range of options now available has exploded in the last few years. You can
now find index funds and ETFs for every asset class imaginable. However, not all options
are created equally. For even more information, check out Mutual Funds For Dummies by
Eric Tyson and Exchange-Traded Funds For Dummies by Russell Wild, both published by
Wiley.
Save for Your Next Vehicle
If you know you’re going to be in the market for a vehicle, set up an escrow account
with a competitive money market fund or account, such as the Orange Savings Account
from ING Direct by calling 800-ING-DIRECT or visiting online at www.ingdirect.com.
The current yield on this account is 4.5 percent. Deposit the amount of money you need
to save each month to have what you’ll need to replace your vehicle when the time
comes. ING Direct doesn’t have any account minimums; you can make weekly, biweekly,
monthly, or periodic contributions to the account in any dollar amount.
Accumulate Funds for a Specific Goal
Set aside money periodically for specific goals, such as your children’s college educa-
tion or a down payment on a home. If you need the money in less than five years,
you should consider something like the Orange Saving Account from ING Direct
(www.ingdirect.com) because it’s safe and easily accessible, but pays a good interest
rate. However, if you have more time available to accumulate money before you need
it, consider the automatic investment options mentioned in the section “Build Your
Personal Portfolio,” earlier in this chapter.
Automate Your Monthly Payments
Set up automatic monthly payments directly out of your checking account to pay all
your regular level monthly expenses. You can also contact your utility companies and
sign up for their average monthly payment plans. Have the monthly cost automatically
deducted from your checking account.
Having these expenses automatically taken out of your checking account means that
you never have to worry about writing bills, purchasing stamps, or incurring late fees,
saving you both time and money.
Trim the Money Tree
Next month, scrutinize each of your monthly bank statements, credit-card statements,
and utility bills. What kinds of expenses appear on these statements or invoices that
you can eliminate without affecting your quality of life?
256
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

For example, you may want to ask yourself some of the following questions:
 Are you actually using the vision package, three-way calling, and call waiting or
caller ID on your cell phone plan?
 Can you downgrade your cable package one notch to save a little money and still
get the majority of the channels that matter most to you?
 Are you paying for online bill payment services that you’re not using?
 Are you paying a monthly service fee to have a checking account? (You don’t
have to; you can find lots of options available on the Internet and most likely in
your community.)
 Are you paying an annual fee for your credit card? Are you getting substantial
value out of paying that fee? If not, cancel that card and use one that doesn’t
charge an annual fee.
What other transactions appear on these statements and invoices that are of no value
or very little value to you? See what you can do about eliminating them.
Other simple ways to help cut your costs include the following:
 Write a grocery list and stick to it when you shop. And never go shopping when
you’re hungry. (You’ll always buy items you don’t need.)
 Eat out no more than once a week. A family of four can easily spend $30 on one
meal at a very inexpensive restaurant — even fast food. You can make that same
meal, or likely a much better one, at home for about one-third of the cost.
 Plant and maintain a small vegetable and herb garden. A small garden with a
few tomato plants, some green beans, basil, and oregano wouldn’t take up much
space. In fact, you can plant all these items in pots on your deck, patio, or bal-
cony. By growing some of your own vegetables and herbs, you not only save
money on your grocery bills, but you and your family also benefit from home-
grown fun and flavor.
 On the weekends, cook up a giant feast, enjoy one large meal for the family,
and freeze the leftovers in individual containers. Now you have homemade,
ready-to-reheat, fabulous frozen meals for a fraction of the cost of quality
processed frozen foods.
 Sell items you don’t use or need, and when you need to buy something,
consider purchasing second-hand quality items. Check out Craigslist at
www.craigslist.org/about/cities.html. This online garage sale site has
exploded over the nation and offers everything from housemates to horseshoes.
You can sell your extra stuff that you no longer use and buy great used stuff that
you need — all for a fraction of what these items would cost new. I just found a
kayak I’ve been wanting for about 50 percent its list price; it’s only four years old
and in perfect condition.
Become a Do-It-Yourselfer
If you currently hire someone to mow your lawn, clean your house, or provide any
other types of domestic services or basic household repairs, explore just how much
money you could save by doing these projects yourself. Not only can you save a lot of
money as a do-it-yourselfer, but as a parent, you’re also educating and empowering
your children to carry on this thrifty lifestyle.

If you’re looking for a DIY resource, remember that you can find a For Dummies book on
almost everything from sewing to remodeling your home. Just go to www.wiley.com
and search for the DIY topic you’re interested in discovering more about.
Entertain on a Dime
Instead of going out to dinner and a movie, consider inviting friends over for a covered
dish dinner, where each person brings a dish. Also, ask each of your guests to bring
two or three of their favorite movies that they may have in their own library collection,
and then vote on what movie the group would love to watch together.
Utilize Your Community Resources
Before you plunk down your hard-earned money to join a gym or for various types of
entertainment and activities, consider what your community has to offer — usually at
little or no cost! Most communities provide access to the following:
 Community swimming pools
 Gymnasium or exercise classes
 Community center
 Local parks or jogging trails
 County libraries
 The county extension agency
 Museums and galleries
 Community colleges and universities
 Concerts
 Festivals
Take advantage of the low-cost public services you pay for with your taxes.

Ten Tips on Getting Organized
In This Chapter
 Simplifying your financial life
 Organizing to minimize stress and unnecessary expenses
G
etting your financial household in order once and for all can help simplify your finan-
cial life and minimize unnecessary stress and expenses that go along with being disor-
ganized. In this chapter, I give you ten tips for how to get organized — and stay that way.
Establishing a System for Your 
Financial Records
The first thing you need to do to get organized is to set up a record-keeping system for your
finances. A well-thought-out record-keeping system can save you a lot of time and money.
Refer to Chapter 2 for a listing of the financial records that you should maintain in your per-
sonal record-keeping system. Set aside a few hours over one weekend and get your financial
household filing system set up once and for all.
Paying Bills the Fast and Easy Way
By paying your bills online or over the telephone, you eliminate having to write a check, 
possibly addressing an envelope, finding and paying for postage, and mailing the payment. It
takes a few minutes to set up this type of service, but you can save at least one or two hours
each month that you would have spent paying bills the old-fashioned way.
Here’s how you can do it:
 If you use a personal computer, your best option is to utilize the online banking option
through your local bank. You can set up each of the individuals or companies with
which you do business or owe money. If the payment remains level and reoccurs each
month, you don’t have to do anything other than remember that that money will be
pulled from your checking account on a certain date. If the payments fluctuate month
to month, you simply need to go into your online banking account and enter the dollar
amount for that payee and the date you want the payment made.

 If you don’t use a personal computer, or you’re not comfortable with online
banking, your bank may offer telephone bill-payment services. This service
works just like an online bill-payment service, but you can use your touchtone
telephone to authorize payments instead.
For more info on these types of services, check with your bank or financial institution.
Consolidating Your Personal Investments
Rather than having investments in a bunch of different locations, consolidate all your
holdings with the same discount brokerage company. By having these investment
accounts all custodied with the same discount broker, you can easily track and
manage these accounts.
However, you do need to have a separate account for each ownership type; for exam-
ple, you may have a joint account with your spouse, an individual Roth IRA, a tradi-
tional IRA, and maybe even another account for the kids’ college funds. You want to
keep these accounts separate, while still consolidating with the same discount broker.
Documenting All Your Important Contacts
Do yourself and your loved ones a big favor by gathering the names and contact infor-
mation for all the important product and service providers in your life on one conve-
niently located list.
Chapter 2 has a form you can use to list all your primary advisors. But think of all the
other people and service providers that ought to be on an easily accessible list.
Contacts you want to list may include some of the following:
 Babysitters
 Pet sitters
 24-hour vet clinic
 Housesitters
 Handymen
 Neighbors
 Teachers
 Business colleagues
 Extended family
Utilizing Technology to Track 
User Names and Passwords
You likely have multiple Web sites that you visit with regularity. For security’s sake,
you probably don’t use the same login-password combination for each site, but how
260
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

can you keep them all straight? Wouldn’t it be very convenient for you to open up the
Web sites and go straight to your account with the click of a couple of buttons?
Well, remembering your user names and passwords really can be that easy. RoboForm
sells a remarkable program that you can download to your hard drive or a USB jump
drive. The software program captures every Web site you visit that requires a user
name and password. The program then acts as your personal “memory” by storing
your favorite Web site addresses, login names, and passwords on one single portable
gadget. You have to remember only one very super-secret password to access all the
information stored on this little gadget. For more information, visit www.roboform.com.
The program costs less than $40 and takes only a few moments to set up. I can’t imag-
ine online life without it.
Automating Your Money Management
Utilize an online bill-payment service through your bank (see previous section on this
topic) and one of the software applications for managing cash flow, such as Quicken
(www.quicken.com) or Mvelopes (www.mvelopes.com) to automatically record and
track your spending on an ongoing basis.
Preparing for the Unthinkable
When thinking about getting organized, imagine what it would be like for your surviv-
ing family if you weren’t around. Preparing for the unthinkable is the most important
thing you can do in the area of getting organized. The key topics include
 Updating your wills, trusts, and other estate-planning documents
 Verifying that your beneficiary designations are valid and current
 Obtaining enough life insurance to support your survivors
 Communicating with your loved ones regarding your final wishes
For more details on how to carry out these tasks, see Chapter 12.
Planning for the Unexpected
What if you find yourself unemployed or unable to work? You really can plan ahead
and have your finances in order, just in case. To do this, you need to have the following
in place:
 Sufficient emergency reserves
 Home equity line of credit
 Disability insurance
261
Chapter 22: Ten Tips on Getting Organized

Preparing an Emergency Kit
Every household and vehicle should have a portable emergency kit. Depending on
whether the emergency kit is for the house or the car, it should contain basic medical
supplies, sunscreen, insect repellent, emergency medicines, flashlights, fresh batteries,
a weather radio, a solar blanket, rain poncho, bottled water, high-energy snacks,
jumper cables, a car charger, flares, and basic hand tools.
If you find yourself in need of any of these supplies, and you are fortunate to be some-
where where you can purchase these items, you’ll likely spend substantially more
money because you didn’t plan ahead.
Purging Your Extra Stuff
In 1950, the average square footage of a typical family home was less than one-half the
size of the average family home today, but people have still figured out how to fill their
houses to capacity. To help do away with clutter so that you can stay more organized,
get rid of anything that you aren’t currently using and have no anticipation of using in
the near future. You can easily let someone else enjoy that item and get a little cash
in return. For example, you can sell your quality, slightly used stuff on Craigslist
(www.craigslist.com), or if you have a whole bunch of stuff, have a garage sale.
Anything that doesn’t sell in the garage sale, donate to charity. Either way, you receive
an economic benefit in return — somebody will either buy it from you, or you get to
write off your donation on your tax return.

Chapter 23
Ten Scams to Avoid
In This Chapter
 Recognizing schemes that are hazardous to your financial health
 Smelling out potential rip-off artists
You’ve probably heard those infomercial offers that seem too good to be true. Well,
they probably are. Believing in the hype of many get-rich-quick schemes or “super-
investment” strategies can actually do the opposite of what they advertise if you aren’t
careful. But don’t worry; in this chapter, I arm you with the necessary tools to recognize and
avoid scam artists. I cover some of the hottest schemes and biggest rip-offs in the financial
services world. Don’t become a victim!
Investing a Tax Shelter inside of a Tax Shelter
If anyone suggests that you invest your retirement funds (tax shelter) or IRAs (tax shelter) in
an annuity (another type of tax shelter), that recommendation is either going to make him a
lot of money, or he doesn’t have your best interests at heart (or both).
Another way to say this is don’t invest your IRA into an annuity contract! I can think of no
good reasons to do so. The excess annual costs, surrender penalties, and inflexibility never
make buying an annuity contract with your tax sheltered retirement dollars a good invest-
ment strategy.
Getting In on an Initial Public Offering (IPO)
When a private company sells its stock publicly for the first time, it’s known as an initial
public offering. You may be intrigued by the opportunity to get rich quick by purchasing
shares of a company the day it goes public. Unfortunately, you only hear or read about very
few massively successful stories.
In most cases, investors who get in on an IPO lose 25 percent of their money by the end of
year one.

Paying for Full-Cost Brokerage Advice
If you currently have a traditional, full-service, full-cost brokerage account and you
have benefited sufficiently from your broker’s advice, then by all means continue using
that broker. However, when you make your own investment decisions, place those
trades through a deep-discount broker like Scottrade (www.scottrade.com) or
Vanguard (www.vanguard.com). You can save hundreds of dollars by investing in each
of your own ideas in the cheapest way possible.
Accepting a Mortgage with 
a Prepayment Penalty
If your mortgage company insists on a prepayment penalty clause, take your business
elsewhere! A prepayment penalty clause simply states that if you pay off your mortgage
early or refinance at any time, you are smacked with potentially thousands of dollars
in penalties.
I once consulted with a woman who was sold a mortgage that had a prepayment
penalty. Interest rates had dropped, the woman’s house had appreciated, and she
needed extra cash, so she refinanced her mortgage. However, she lost about $4,500 in
prepayment penalties when she refinanced her mortgage. If she had had a traditional
mortgage, she wouldn’t have had a prepayment penalty.
Falling for Get-Rich-Quick Schemes
So many get-rich-quick schemes are out there, just waiting for a willing victim, but they
usually come out of the woodwork in one of the following packages:
 Late-night infomercials that, for example, boast of investing in real estate with
no money down.
 Books, videos, or software systems promoted by money gurus.
 Free seminars entitled “The Secrets to Great Wealth” (or anything like that).
Don’t think that financial service people and companies put on these big, expen-
sive shin-digs for completely educational or charitable reasons. They likely have
motivational tapes, investment schemes, or money management services to sell;
either way, they’re after your business — make no mistake about it.
 Day trading (buying and selling stocks, possibly multiple times a day) hasn’t
experienced explosive growth since the technology bubble burst. But I’m sure a
comeback will come soon enough — as long as people still believe that they can
win big. But take note: The most respected investors of all time wouldn’t con-
sider day-trading investing — and neither should you.
264
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 The old bait-and-switch routine can easily lure you in if you aren’t prepared. For
example, you may receive what appear to be tickets to an important and valu-
able event. All you have to do is just call the number on the cover letter to con-
firm your limited reservation. The seminar is advertised to be a $149 value, but
is free to you and a guest. But when you sit through the “free” seminar, it turns
out to be just a teaser. You would have to spend $350 to get the complete tapes
and workbook “system” that was advertised, and you just wasted hours on what
was literally a commercial. And most likely, if something is that hard to sell, it
must not be all that desirable.
Prepaying for Membership Schemes
Think very carefully before investing in any sort of pay-in-advance membership or
ownership program. Pay-as-you-go membership is often much more appropriate and
cost effective for your situation.
Common examples include the following:
 Vacation timeshares: A vacation timeshare is a concept that enables an individual
to buy the rights, along with 40 or so other people, to one week at a resort.
Making money or breaking even as an investor in a vacation timeshare is
extremely difficult. Most timeshare owners don’t realize at the outset just how
much money it can cost to own and utilize their timeshare vacation week each
year. Timeshare buyers often finance their purchases through the timeshare com-
pany, and although the interest may be tax-deductible, the rates are very high.
Add the cost of the timeshare (at least $10,000), plus any interest if you go into
debt to buy the timeshare, plus the annual maintenance (anywhere from $600 to
$1,000 for each timeshare week you buy), special assessment and taxes, and the
cost of travel to and from the resort location, and you could easily afford to stay
one week at an extremely nice hotel or resort, anywhere you want, anytime you
want. Don’t let the excitement of the moment cause you to lose sight of your most
important financial objectives (see Chapter 5).
 Athletic, tennis, and golf clubs: Ask yourself why you join these clubs: as a motiva-
tor to exercise, as a social outlet, for the prestige of membership, or purely to 
exercise? Ask yourself whether the money you spend on these types of club
memberships is worth it to you. Do you have any alternatives, such as public golf
courses and community tennis courts, that can provide you with the desired bene-
fits without the big price tag? For example, if you go to the gym to run on the tread-
mill, you can easily take a jog around your neighborhood for free or even invest in a
treadmill of your own (which over time will cost less than your club membership).
Spending Too Much for
Investment Management
Many people make the mistake of thinking that they must spend a lot of money to
receive quality investment management services. That may have been true once, but it
isn’t true any longer. Professional investment management services have become a
commodity, resulting in a drastic reduction in costs. And the availability of index funds
and exchange-traded funds have also had a significant impact in driving prices lower.
265
Chapter 23: Ten Scams to Avoid

 Mutual funds and variable annuity subaccounts: The annual expense ratios for
these accounts shouldn’t exceed the amounts found in Worksheet 23-1. If your
money is invested in index funds or exchange-traded funds, pay attention to the
Passive column, and if you’re invested with a private money manager or in an
actively managed mutual fund, then you need to look at the Active column.
Worksheet 23-1
Annual Expense Ratios
Passive
Active
0.20 percent for a Standard and 
1.00 percent for mid- to large-cap domestic 
Poor’s 500 Index fund
stock funds
0.40 percent for small- or mid-cap 
1.20 percent for large-cap foreign 
index or exchange-traded funds
stock funds
0.60 percent for small- or mid-cap foreign 
1.50 percent for small- to mid-cap foreign 
stock index or exchange-traded funds
stock funds or emerging-markets funds
0.20 percent for domestic-bond funds 
0.70 percent for domestic bond funds 
and exchange-traded funds
0.60 percent for foreign bond index 
1.00 percent for foreign bond funds
funds and exchange-traded funds
 Private money managers, wealth managers, financial advisors, and so on:
Money managers hired to manage your mutual fund or exchange-traded fund port-
folio on an ongoing basis often charge 0.20 percent to 1.00 percent on top of what
the mutual funds and exchange-traded funds charge. So, total management
expenses could range from 0.40 percent to 2.60 percent depending on the manager
and the investments chosen. The high end is over six times the expense of the low-
cost alternative. Try to stay at the low to middle end of this expense range. Keep in
mind that your overall portfolio allocation is the deciding factor in your total cost.
 Also, money managers hired to manage a portfolio of individual stocks on a long-
term, buy-and-hold basis should charge no more than 1.00 percent per year. And
money managers in charge of fixed-income portfolios should charge no more than
about 0.60 percent per year. If you’re paying more than that, you should try nego-
tiating with your current advisor and, if that fails, shop around for a new advisor!
I address only annual money management fees in this section. There are still sales
commissions and surrender penalties on thousands of funds, so watch out for total
costs, too. For more on getting the right advisor at the right price, see Chapter 20.
Repairing Your Credit
You may have seen advertisements by companies offering to fix your credit for an easy
payment of $300. Don’t waste your money! Nothing can re-establish or improve your
credit other than your persistence and time. For more on your credit and how to
improve it, check out Chapter 5, or you can even delve into Credit Repair Kit For
Dummies by Stephen R. Bucci (Wiley) or Your Credit Score: How to Fix, Improve, and
Protect the 3-Digit Number that Shapes Your Financial Future by Liz Pullium Weston 
(FT Press), a personal favorite.
266
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Considering Payday Loans
Payday-loan companies are extremely profitable ventures. They give very short-term
loans to people who are temporarily strapped for cash, at interest rates between
150 percent to more than 300 percent per year.
For example, you borrow $500 from a payday-loan company and plan to repay the loan
in one month. At the end of one month, you owe the loan company $625. Most people
have to renew their loan because they don’t have the money to pay off the loan a month
later. Just two months after borrowing $500, they now owe almost $800.
The abusive lending tactics rampant in the payday-loan business have caused many
states to outlaw payday-loan services altogether, which is why you should avoid them
as well. If you find yourself in need of cash before payday, a better option is to borrow
money from traditional lenders.
Investing Like a Venture Capitalist
Venture capitalists are experienced investors and business people who have substantial
resources and significant traditional financial investment holdings. They occasionally
supplement their traditional financial investments with riskier, first-of-its-kind speculat-
ing. Venture capitalists can afford to lose all their investments, but can you?
Most likely not. My advice: Get rich slowly — always a more prudent investment strat-
egy. You can find thousands of quality, publicly traded mutual funds, exchange-traded
funds, and stocks in which you can invest. And you can obtain a variety of research on
these traditional financial investment vehicles.

Ten or So Types of Insurance You
Don’t Really Need to Buy
In This Chapter
 Saying no to limited scope coverage
 Buying insurance only for risks you can’t afford to bear yourself
You can probably find as many illegitimate types of insurance products out there as
legitimate ones. But before you buy a policy, remember this important point: You
should only buy insurance to protect yourself and your property against risks that you can’t
afford to bear yourself.
In this chapter, I list ten types of insurance coverages that may not be worth the money for
you. (Think twice before wasting your money.)
Buying Insurance to Cover Only Cancer
or Another Specific Illness
Don’t buy a health insurance or income replacement policy that covers just cancer. If you
need health or income replacement (disability) insurance, buy a policy that covers you for
any illness or injury.
Specialty policies, such as cancer insurance, can be very expensive and duplicative to your
primary health insurance.
Trying to Avoid Putting Your Insurance Money
Where Your Mouth Is: Dental Insurance
You buy insurance to transfer the risk of a loss that you cannot afford to bear to an insurance
company. The cost of dental insurance, in most cases, will exceed the cost of just paying out
of pocket for the services you need. In addition, many dental plans don’t cover orthodontia —
a motivating factor to acquire the insurance, in many cases. So when it comes to dental
insurance, put your money where your mouth is and pay for those services on your own;
skip the dental insurance.

Ask your dentist how much annual routine cleanings and other services you need typi-
cally cost. Then add up the cost of one year’s worth of dental insurance for the policy
you’re considering and weigh your risks. Then see how much it pays of the services
you need. When you do the math, you’ll realize that you’re very likely not seeing any
savings. Remember, the insurace commpany is in business to make money — off you!
Seeing Clearly: Buy the Glasses,
Not the Vision Insurance
Like dental insurance, vision insurance is another one of those expenses that you’re
best off avoiding. Pay for your own eye exams, glasses, and contact lenses and forget
about buying vision insurance. You’ll come out ahead in the long run when you self-
insure.
Vision insurance is generally not worth purchasing your own private policy. If your
employer provides vision coverage free of charge or at a substantial discount, go for it,
but not if you have to pay 100 percent of the premiums yourself. Add these costs into
your budget. Vision expenses are risks you can’t afford to bear yourself, and you don’t
need to transfer them to an insurance company.
Saving the Premiums You Would Have Paid
for Credit Life and Disability Insurance
Credit life and disability insurance, unfortunately, are a big waste of money. You’re
better off saving the money from the premiums and putting the funds in a rainy-day
account to cover these events.
Thinking about Accidental Death
and Dismemberment Insurance
If you need life insurance, buy life insurance that covers you for any cause of death,
not just accidental death. Dismemberment coverage pays a cash benefit even if you
live, but you have to lose your sight and an arm or a leg, or some unlikely combination,
before it will pay off. Don’t waste your money.
Trying to Come Out Ahead: Reduced-
Term Life Insurance
Also sold as mortgage insurance, this type of insurance pays off your mortgage should
you die before the mortgage is paid in full. It sounds good, but you can buy a term life
insurance policy where the benefits don’t go down over time for the same amount of
money, or possibly less.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 

These policies typically cost about eight times the amount that a traditional term life
insurance with the same death benefit would pay.
You Don’t Need Home Warranty Plans
Good luck on getting the insurance company to actually pay a claim! However, when
you purchase a new home, you may feel more comfortable with a home warranty. But
after the first year, I’d drop the coverage. 
Save your money on this type of insurance and use it instead on general home mainte-
nance and repairs.
Extending Warranties on Electronics
and Computer Equipment
Most items come with their own warranties. Of course, sales people often get a hefty
commission when they talk you into purchasing extended warranties. When you buy a
new appliance or electronic gadget, sales people will most likely offer you an extended
warranty. These policies are hugely profitable for the sellers. If these were a good deal
for you, they wouldn’t be selling them. The chances are that when your equipment
goes ker-plunk, you can purchase new items on your own for less than the premiums
you paid to purchase the extended warranties.
Only about 2 percent of all extended warranties are ever utilized. In fact one big-box
retailer reports that in one year, approximately 45 percent of its profits came from the
sale of these warranties.
Saying No to Extra Coverage
on Your Rental Cars
Check with your auto insurance provider because you may already be covered. If you
aren’t already covered, you can probably add this coverage much more cost effec-
tively through your auto insurance company than by buying a separate policy.
Realizing that You May Not Be Insuring
Your Trip: Travel Insurance
Definitely don’t buy travel insurance through the company you’re purchasing the trip
from. In addition, this type of coverage can be extremely limited and expensive. In
fact, you may even have some good coverage through your credit-card company at no
additional cost. So if you’re worried about becoming ill and missing your trip or the
company you’re purchasing your trip from going belly up, give your credit-card com-
pany a call.
271
Chapter 24: Ten or So Types of Insurance You Don’t Really Need to Buy

Another type of travel coverage provides funds if you or one of your travel compan-
ions becomes ill and you have to cancel your trip, the airline loses your luggage, or
you have a medical emergency while traveling outside of the country and have to be
evacuated to a medical facility. This coverage can be very expensive and may overlap
with other insurance you have. Before traveling outside the country, contact your
health insurance company and confirm whether or not it provides coverage outside of
the United States; many don’t. 
Steer Clear of Pet Insurance
Pet insurance is a profit center for the insurance company. In other words, it doesn’t
pay off for most purchases of the coverage. Plan for pet care expenses in your budget.
Don’t buy the insurance.
