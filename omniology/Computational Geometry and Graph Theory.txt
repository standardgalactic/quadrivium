Preface
This volume consists of the refereed proceedings of the Kyoto Conference on
Computational Geometry and Graph Theory (KyotoCGGT 2007), held at Kyoto
University in Kyoto, Japan, 11–15 June 2007, to honor Jin Akiyama and Vaˇsek
Chv´atal on their 60th birthdays. More than 200 participants from 20 countries
attended the conference.
Akiyama and Chv´atal have been good friends since they met in Tokyo in
1979. Akiyama started the conference series Japan Conference on Discrete and
Computational Geometry (JCDCG) in 1997, which has been held annually since
that time. In 2001, the conference venue began to alternate between Tokyo and
selected Asian cities to attract and encourage Asian graph theorists and ge-
ometers. Chv´atal, on the other hand, is world-renowned for his contributions to
discrete mathematics.
Since it was ﬁrst organized in 1997, the annual JCDCG conference has at-
tracted a growing international participation. Earlier conferences were held in
Tokyo, followed by conferences in Manila, Philippines (2001), Bandung, Indone-
sia (2003), and Tianjin and Xi’an, China (2005). The proceedings of JCDCG
1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, IJCCGGT 2003 and CJCDGCGT 2005 were published
by Springer in the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) as volumes
1763, 2098, 2866, 3742, 3330 and 4381, respectively, while the proceedings of
JCDCG 2001 were also published by Springer as a special issue of the journal
Graphs and Combinatorics, Vol. 18, No. 4, 2002.
The organizers of KyotoCGGT 2007 gratefully acknowledge the support of
the sponsors, the work of the conference secretariat and the participation of the
principal speakers : William Cook, Greg Frederickson, Ferran Hurtado, Joseph
O’Rourke, J´anos Pach, Bruce Reed, Akira Saito, Kokichi Sugihara, Godfried

Abstract. Let A and B be convex polygons. We say that A and B are
D-equivalent if there are convex polygons A = A1, A2, . . . , An = B and
Dudeney dissections of Ai to Ai+1 (1 ≤i ≤n −1). A polygon is called a
tile if the 2-dimensional Euclidean plane can be tiled by congruent copies
of the polygon. A polygon is called a normal tile if the plane can be tiled
by congruent copies of the polygon which are obtained without turning
over the polygon. The numbers of types of convex tiles and convex normal
tiles are still uncertain. In this paper, we prove that all convex normal
tiles with the same area that we know so far are D-equivalent.

Introduction
H. E. Dudeney proposed the following problem [3]: “Cut an equilateral triangle
into four pieces and put them together to make a perfect square without turn-
ing over any piece.” After he gave an answer, he wrote “I add an illustration
showing the puzzle in a rather curious practical form, as it was made in polished
mahogany with brass hinges for use by certain audiences. It will be seen that
the four pieces form a sort of chain, and that when they are closed up in one
direction they form the triangle, and when closed in the other direction they
form the square.” (See Fig. 1.)
We will deﬁne a Dudeney dissection following Dudeney’s problem. Let A and
B be convex polygons with the same area. A Dudeney dissection of A to B is a
partition of A into a ﬁnite number of parts which can be reassembled to produce
B as follows: Hinge the adjoining parts of A on points along the perimeter of A,
then ﬁx one of the parts and rotate the remaining parts about the ﬁxed part to
form B in such a way that:
(1) All of the perimeter of A is in the interior of B.
(2) The perimeter of B consists of the dissection lines in the interior of A.
(3) The pieces of A are never turned over.
Note that it is not necessary that the pieces form a sort of chain. Dudeney
dissections of various convex polygons are discussed in [1] and [2]. A convex
polygon A is Dudeney dissectible if there exists a Dudeney dissection of A to B
for some convex polygon B.

Let A and B be convex polygons. We say that A can be transformed to B if
there are convex polygons A1, A2, . . . , An, where n ≥2, A1 = A and An = B,
and Dudeney dissections of Ai to Ai+1 (1 ≤i ≤n −1). We denote this by
A →B. Let P be the set of all Dudeney dissectible convex polygons with a
given area. Then we have, for A, B, C ∈P,
(i) A →A,
(ii) A →B implies B →A,
(iii) A →B, B →C implies A →C.
Thus the transformation is an equivalence relation of P. We say that A and B
are D-equivalent or that A is D-equivalent to B if A →B.
A polygon is called a tile if the plane R2 (2-dimensional Euclidean plane) can
be tiled by congruent copies of the polygon, where we say that R2 can be tiled
if R2 is covered without gaps or (2-dimensional) overlaps. A polygon is called
a normal tile if the plane R2 can be tiled by congruent copies of the polygon
which are obtained without turning over the polygon.
It is known that if a convex n-gon is a tile, then we have n ≤6 ([8]). Every
triangle and every quadrilateral are tiles. Let ABCDEF be a hexagonal tile where
a = FA, b = AB, c = BC, d = CD, e = DE, f = EF. All convex hexagonal tiles
have been classiﬁed into three types: type 1: ̸ A + ̸ B + ̸ C = 360◦, a = d,
type 2: ̸ A + ̸ B + ̸ D = 360◦, a = d, c = e, type 3: ̸ A = ̸ C = ̸ E =
120◦, a = b, c = d, e = f. There are no other convex hexagonal tiles ([5], p494).
However, the number of types of convex pentagonal tiles is still uncertain. At
present, 14 types of convex pentagons are known to be tiles ([9], [10], [13]). We
follow the numbering of the types given in [5] (p492) and [13].
Every triangle, every quadrilateral, hexagons of types 1, 3, and pentagons of
types 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 are normal tiles. Pentagons and hexagons of the other types are
normal tiles if they have line symmetry.
All convex normal tiles that we know so far are the following: (1) every trian-
gle, (2) every convex quadrilateral, (3) pentagons of types 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, (4) pen-
tagons of types 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 with line symmetry, (5) hexagons of
types 1, 3, (6) hexagons of type 2 with line symmetry.
In this paper, we will prove that all the above polygons with a given area are
D-equivalent, that is, we will prove the following theorem.

Dudeney Transformation of Normal Tiles

Theorem 1. The following polygons with the same area are all D-equivalent:
(1) every triangle,
(2) every convex quadrilateral,
(3) pentagons of types 1, 3, 4, 5, 6,
(4) pentagons of types 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 with line symmetry,
(5) hexagons of types 1, 3,
(6) hexagons of type 2 with line symmetry.
In this paper, we consider only convex polygons, so we sometimes call them just
“polygons” for simplicity.

Triangles and Quadrilaterals
Proposition 2.1. All triangles and quadrilaterals with the same area are D-
equivalent.
Proof. Suppose that triangles and quadrilaterals we consider here have the area
1. The proof consists of four steps:
Step 1. Any triangle can be transformed to a parallelogram.
Step 2. Any quadrilateral can be transformed to a parallelogram.
Step 3. Any parallelogram can be transformed to a rectangle.
Step 4. Any rectangle can be transformed to a square.
If we prove Steps 1, 2, 3 and 4, then we ﬁnd any triangle and any quadrilateral
can be transformed to a square, thus we complete the proof.
Step 1. Let ABC be any triangle. Let L, M, N be the midpoints of AB, BC,
CA, respectively. Draw dotted lines LN and AM and tile the plane with the
triangle ABC as shown in Fig. 2. Cut it along the dotted lines, then we have
four parts. Rotate three parts of them as shown in the ﬁgure, then we obtain a
parallelogram DEFG.
Step 2. Let ABCD be any (convex) quadrilateral. Let L, M, N, K be the mid-
points of AB, BC, CD, DA, respectively. Draw dotted lines LN and KM and
tile the plane with the quadrilateral ABCD as shown in Fig. 3. Cut it along
the dotted lines, then we have four parts. Rotate three parts of them as shown
in the ﬁgure, then we obtain a parallelogram EFGH. We note that Step 1 is a
degenerate case of Step 2.

Step 3. Let ABCD be any parallelogram. We can assume AB ≤BC and ̸ B
≤90◦. Let L and M be the midpoints of AB and CD, respectively. Let S and T be
points on the segments AD and BC, respectively, such that ST is perpendicular
to LM, and the intersection point N of ST and LM is in the parallelogram ABCD.
We can choose such points S, T under our assumption. Draw dotted lines LM
and ST. Tile the plane with the parallelogram ABCD as shown in Fig. 4. Cut it
along the dotted lines, then we have four parts. Rotate three parts of them as
shown in the ﬁgure, then we obtain a rectangle EFGH.
Step 4. We will prove the following Lemmata.
Lemma 2.1. Any rectangle can be transformed to a rectangle such that all side-
lengths are less than or equal to
√
2.
Proof. Let ABCD be any rectangle with AB ≥BC. Put a =AB.
If a >
√
2, cut the rectangle ABCD into ﬁve pieces as shown in Fig. 5, where
AE=FB=DH=GC= a/4 and I, J, K, L are midpoints of AD, EH, FG, BC,
respectively. Rotate four pieces as shown in the ﬁgure, we obtain a new rectangle
A′B′C′D′ with A′B′= a/2 and B′C′= 2/a.
(i) When
√
2 < a < 2, then a/2 < 1 < 2/a <
√
2. The side-lengths A′B′ and
B′C′ of the new rectangle are less than
√
2.
(ii) When 2 ≤a ≤2
√
2, then 1 ≤a/2 ≤
√
2. The side-lengths A′B′ and B′C′
of the new rectangle are less than or equal to
√
2.
(iii) When a > 2
√
2, then a/2 >
√
2. The side-length A′B′ of the new rectangle
is still greater than
√
2. In this case, repeat the above Dudeney dissection until
all the side-lengths of a new rectangle are less than or equal to
√
2.
Thus we complete the proof of Lemma 2.1.

Lemma 2.2. Any rectangle of size a×a−1 can be transformed to a square, where
a, a−1 ≤
√
2.
Proof. The following dissection is Taylor’s dissection applied in the case of rec-
tangles. (For Taylor’s dissection, see [4] p102, [12] p89.) Let ABCD be any rec-
tangle with AB ≤BC. Put a =BC, then we have 1 ≤a ≤
√
2. We may assume
a ̸= 1. Let O be the center of the rectangle ABCD, and K, L, M, N the midpoints
of AB, BC, CD, DA, respectively. Let T be the point on the segment ND with
OT = 1/2. We can choose the point T since OD > 1/2 and ON < 1/2 (because
of a > 1). Let P be the point on the segment OT such that MP is perpendicular
to OT. We can choose such a point P. In fact, draw the uper semicircle with the
diameter OM, then it is inside or on the rectangle OMDN as a ≤
√
2. We note
that when a =
√
2, the point P corresponds to the point T.

Similarly we draw segments OS and KQ (Fig. 6). Then cut the rectangle
ABCD into four pieces along the lines TS, MP, KQ, and rotate them as shown
in Fig. 7. Then we obtain a rectangle. We see that it is a square since QT + TP
= 1. This completes the proof of Lemma 2.2.
⊓⊔
Therefore we complete Step 4 and then the proof of Prop. 2.1.
⊓⊔
3
Hexagons
All convex hexagonal tiles have been classiﬁed into three types: type 1, 2, 3. There
are no other convex hexagonal tiles. Hexagons of type 1 and 3 and hexagons of
type 2 with line symmetry are normal tiles. In this section, we prove the following
proposition.
Proposition 3.1. Hexagons of type 1 and 3 and hexagons of type 2 with line
symmetry can be transformed to quadrilaterals.
Proof. Let ABCDEF be a hexagon. Put a = FA, b = AB, c = BC, d = CD, e =
DE, f = EF.
(1) Assume that ABCDEF is a hexagon of type 1, i.e., ̸ A + ̸ B + ̸ C =
360◦, a = d. First we will show that the hexagon can be transformed to a parallel
hexagon. We call a hexagon parallel if all pairs of opposite sides are parallel and
have the same length. Let K, L, M, N be the midpoints of AB, BC, DE, EF,
respectively. Let P and Q be points such that KP is parallel to QM and LP is

parallel to QN. In the tiling of Fig. 8, cut the hexagon into four pieces along the
dotted lines and rotate three pieces, then we obtain a parallel hexagon.
Next we will show that any parallel hexagon A′B′C′D′E′F′ can be transformed
to a parallelogram. Let L, M, N, K be the midpoints of A′B′, C′D′, D′E′, F′A′,
respectively. As shown in Fig. 9, the parallel hexagon can be transformed to a
parallelogram.
Thus hexagons of type 1 can be transformed to quadrilaterals.
(2) Assume that ABCDEF is a hexagon of type 3, i.e., ̸ A = ̸ C = ̸ E =
120◦, a = b, c = d, e = f. The hexagon can be transformed to a quadrilateral as
shown in Fig. 10.
(3) Assume that ABCDEF is a hexagon of type 2, i.e., ̸ A + ̸ B + ̸ D =
360◦, a = d, c = e. When the hexagon has line symmetry, it has either a line of
symmetry through opposite sides, or a line of symmetry through opposite points.
In the former case, the opposite sides are parallel and have the same lengths, so
the hexagon is also of type 1. So we consider only the latter case.
If the hexagon has a line of symmetry AD, then we have a = b, c = f, d = e, ̸ B
= ̸ F, ̸ C= ̸ E. So we have a = b = c = d = e = f. Let L, M, N, K be midpoints
of BC, CD, EF, FA. The hexagon can be transformed to a quadrilateral as shown
in Fig. 11.
If the hexagon has a line of symmetry BE, then we have b = c, e = f, ̸ A
= ̸ C, ̸ F = ̸ D. So we have c = f and ̸ A +̸ B + ̸ F = 360◦. It is also of
type 1.

If the hexagon has a line of symmetry FC, then it is relatively the same as the
hexagon with a line of symmetry AD. So it can be transformed to a quadrilateral.
Thus hexagons of type 2 with line symmetry can be transformed to a quadri-
lateral.
This completes the proof of Prop. 3.1.
⊓⊔

Pentagons
At the present, 14 types of convex pentagons are known to be tiles. Pentagons
of types 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 are normal tiles, and pentagons of the other types are nor-
mal tiles if they have line symmetry. In this section, we prove the following
propositions.
Proposition 4.1. A pentagon of type 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 can be transformed to a triangle
or a quadrilateral.
Proof. Let ABCDE be a pentagon. Put a = EA, b = AB, c = BC, d = CD, e =
DE.
(1) Assume that ABCDE is a pentagon of type 1, i.e., ̸ D + ̸ E = 180◦. Cut
the pentagon into four pieces along the dotted lines and rotate three pieces as
shown in Fig. 12, where K, L, M are the midpoints of AB, BC, DE, respectively,
and KL and MN are parallel. Then we obtain a parallelogram.
(2) Assume that ABCDE is a pentagon of type 3, i.e., ̸ A = ̸ C = ̸ D =
120◦, a = b, d = c + e. The pentagon can be transformed to a rhombus as shown
in Fig. 13.
(3) Assume that ABCDE is a pentagon of type 4, i.e., ̸ A = ̸ D = 90◦,
a = b, d = e. The pentagon can be transformed to a triangle as shown in Fig.
14, where M is the midpoint of BC.
(4) Assume that ABCDE is a pentagon of type 5, i.e., ̸ A = 60◦, ̸ C = 120◦,
a = b, c = d. The pentagon can be transformed to an equilateral triangle as
shown in Fig. 15, where M is the midpoint of DE.
(5) Assume that ABCDE is a pentagon of type 6, i.e., ̸ A + ̸ B +̸ D = 360◦,
̸ A = 2̸ C, a = b = e, c = d. The pentagon can be transformed to a triangle as
shown in Fig. 16, where M is the midpoint of AB.
This completes the proof of Prop. 4.1.

Proposition 4.2. If a pentagon of type 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 has line sym-
metry, it can be transformed to a triangle or a quadrilateral.
Proof. Let ABCDE be a pentagon. Put a = EA, b = AB, c = BC, d = CD, e =
DE.
(1) Assume that ABCDE is a pentagon of type 2, i.e., ̸ C + ̸ E = 180◦, a = d.
(i) If the pentagon has a line of symmetry through point A, we have ̸ B =
̸ E, ̸ C = ̸ D, a = b, c = e. Then we have ̸ A = 180◦which is a contradiction.
Thus the pentagon doesn’t have a line of symmetry through point A.
(ii) If the pentagon has a line of symmetry through point B, we have ̸ A =
̸ C, ̸ D = ̸ E, b = c. Then we have ̸ B = 180◦which is a contradiction. Thus
the pentagon doesn’t have a line of symmetry through point B.
(iii) If the pentagon has a line of symmetry through point C, we have ̸ B =
̸ D, ̸ A = ̸ E, c = d, b = e. Then we have ̸ B + ̸ D = 180◦+ ̸ C. If ̸ C ≤60◦,
then we have ̸ C +̸ D ≤180◦, so we have a < d which contradicts to a = d. If
60◦< ̸ C < 90◦, then it can be transformed to a triangle as shown in Fig. 17,
where K, L, M are the midpoints of CD, EA, AB, respectively. If ̸ C = 90◦,
then ̸ E = ̸ A = 90◦. It is also a pentagon of type 1. If 90◦< ̸ C < 180◦, then
0◦< ̸ E ≤90◦. Thus we have a > d which contradicts to a = d.
(iv) If the pentagon has a line of symmetry through point D, then we have
̸ A = ̸ B, ̸ C = ̸ E, a = c, d = e. It can be transformed to a triangle as shown
in Fig. 18.
(v) If the pentagon has a line of symmetry through point E, then we have ̸ A
= ̸ D, ̸ B = ̸ C, a = e, b = d. Then we have ̸ A + ̸ D = 180◦+ ̸ E. If ̸ E

≤60◦, ̸ A = ̸ D ≤120◦, so we have ̸ A +̸ E ≤180◦and ̸ D +̸ E ≤180◦. It
contradicts to a = b = d = e. If 60◦< ̸ E < 90◦, then the pentagon ABCDE
can be transformed to a pentagon HBDJI of type 1 as shown in Fig. 19, where
M is the midpoint of AB and HB, AG, IJ are parallel.
If ̸ E = 90◦, then ̸ B = ̸ C = 90◦. It is also of type 1. If 90◦< ̸ E < 180◦,
then the pentagon ABCDE can be transformed to a quadrilateral EIJG as shown
in Fig. 20, where M is the midpoint of DC; EF, GH, SB are parallel and AF =
DG = CH.
The proofs of the following are omitted because they are similar to the above.
(2) Assume that ABCDE is a pentagon of type 7, i.e., 2̸ B + ̸ C = 2̸ D +
̸ A = 360◦, a = b = c = d. If the pentagon has a line of symmetry through
point C, then it is also of type 1. There are no pentagons of type 7 with a line
of symmetry through point A, B, D, or E.
(3) Assume that ABCDE is a pentagon of type 8, i.e., 2̸ A + ̸ B = 2̸ D +
̸ C = 360◦, a = b = c = d. If the pentagon has a line of symmetry through point
E, then it can be transformed to a triangle as shown in Fig. 21. There are no
pentagons of type 8 with a line of symmetry through point A, B, C, or D.
(4) A pentagon of type 9 is characterized by 2̸ E + ̸ B = 2̸ D + ̸ C = 360◦,
a = b = c = d. There are no pentagons of type 9 with line symmetry.
(5) Assume that ABCDE is a pentagon of type 10, i.e., ̸ A = 90◦, ̸ B + ̸ E =
180◦, 2̸ D + ̸ E = 2̸ C + ̸ B = 360◦, a = b = c + e. If the pentagon has a line
of symmetry through point A, then it is also of type 1. There are no pentagons
of type 10 with a line of symmetry through point B, C, D, or E.

(6) A pentagon of type 11 is characterized by ̸ A = 90◦, ̸ C + ̸ E = 180◦,
2̸ B + ̸ C = 360◦, d = e = 2a + c. There are no pentagons of type 11 with line
symmetry.
(7) A pentagon of type 12 is characterized by ̸ A = 90◦, ̸ C + ̸ E = 180◦,
2̸ B + ̸ C = 360◦, 2a = c + e = d. There are no pentagons of type 12 with line
symmetry.
(8) A pentagon of type 13 is characterized by ̸ A = ̸ C = 90◦, 2̸ B + ̸ D =
2̸ E + ̸ D = 360◦, c = d, 2c = e. There are no pentagons of type 13 with line
symmetry.
(9) A pentagon of type 14 is characterized by ̸ A = 90◦, ̸ C + ̸ E = 180◦,
2̸ B + ̸ C = 360◦, d = e = 2a, a = c. There are no pentagons of type 14 with
line symmetry.
This completes the proof of Prop. 4.2.
⊓⊔
From Prop. 2.1, 3.1, 4.1 and 4.2, we obtain Theorem 1.

Abstract. A tile T in the plane is a compact set whose boundary is a
simple closed curve. A family of tiles in the plane is called a tiling if it
covers the plane with no gaps and no (2-dimensional) overlaps. Let V be a
doubly covered square, that is, a ﬂat polygon consisting of two congruent
square faces joined together along each of their corresponding edges. We
prove that for every development (unfolding) T of V , there is a tiling
of congruent copies of T whose chromatic number is at most three. By
using this fact, we prove that chromatic numbers of speciﬁed isohedral
tilings with half-turn symmetry are at most three. Then, we notice that
self-replicating tiles with fractal boundaries derived from developments
of a doubly covered square, which we studied in [3,4], are three-colorable
in a sense.

Introduction
We consider ﬁgures in the Euclidean plane. A tile in the plane is a compact set
whose boundary is a simple closed curve. A family of tiles, T = {Tα}n∈Λ, is called
a tiling if it covers the plane with no gaps and no (2-dimensional) overlaps. Two
tiles in the tiling T are adjacent if the topological dimension of their intersection
is one. A doubly covered square is a ﬂat polygon consisting of two congruent
square faces joined together along each of their corresponding edges. A tile T
is called a development of a doubly covered square V if there is a map fT from
T onto V which is locally isometric and whose image has no (2-dimensional)
overlaps.
Section 2 is devoted to preliminaries. We showed in [3,5] that for every develop-
ment T of a doubly-covered square V there is a tiling T consisting of congruent
copies of T . In Section 3, we prove that such tiling T has chromatic number
χ(T ) ≤3, that is, there is an assignment of three colors to the tiles in T in such
a way that any two adjacent tiles have diﬀerent colors (Theorem 1). Notice that
any tiling T of congruent copies of T satisﬁes χ(T ) ≤4 by Four Colar theorem,
but it is not necessary to satisfy χ(T ) ≤3 in general (see Fig. 1 for an example;
T is a development of V and any tiling containing six congruent copies of T in
Fig. 1(b) has chromatic number four).

An isohedral tiling of the plane is a tiling of congruent copies of a single tile
so that the symmetry group of the tiling acts transitively on the tiles. In Section
4, we prove that a speciﬁed isohedral tiling T with half-turn symmetry has
chromatic number χ(T ) ≤3 (Theorem 2). A tile T is called self-replicating or
k-replicating if there are k congruent copies of T so that interiors of any two of
them are disjoint and that their union is similar to the original ﬁgure T . A simple
curve in the plane is called fractal if its Hausdorﬀ-dimension is more than one.
In Section 5, we show suﬃcient conditions under which self-replicating tiles with
fractal boundaries can be derived from developments of doubly-covered squares.
These tiles are three-colorable in a sense (Theorem 4).

Preliminaries
Let T be a development of a doubly covered square V with a map fT from T onto
V which is locally isometric and whose image has no (2-dimensional) overlaps.
We denote by fT (∂T ) the image of the boundary ∂T (Fig.2(b)). A point A in ∂T
is called a leaf-point if its image is a leaf (an end-point) of fT (∂T ) (for example,
A, C, D in Fig. 2(a)). A point P in ∂T is called a singular point if there are
more than two points (including P) in ∂T whose images by fT are identical (for
example, P1, P2 and P3 in Fig. 2(a)).
Proposition 1. ([6]) Let T be a development of the doubly covered square V .
(1) The image fT (∂T ) is a tree, that is, it is connected and has no cycle

(2) All vertices of V are in fT (∂T ) (Fig. 2(b)).
(3) Every leaf-point in ∂T is only one pre-image of some vertex in V by fT
(Fig. 2(a)(b)).
Proposition 2. Let T be a development of V . Then there are at least two leaf-
points.
Proof. Since any tree has at least two leaves and leaves of the tree fT (∂T ) are
vertices of V , there are at least two leaf-points in ∂T .
⊓⊔
Proposition 3. ([3,5]) Every development T of V tiles the plane, that is, there
is a family of congruent copies of T which is a tiling.
Carve distinct ﬁgures on each of the faces of V , dip the faces in ink and print the
ﬁgures on a blank sheet as follows: First, print the ﬁgures on one face, choose
one edge of the face as an axis, turn V over along the axis and print the ﬁgure
on the other face. Repeat the process continuously. The printed pattern that
results is a periodic tiling of the plane. Moreover the same pattern will result
regardless of the direction or order in which V is turned over. It is convenient
to use orthogonal coordinates (x, y) in the plane and consider a development of
V as a ﬁgure in the plane, so that faces of V corresponds to unit squares in the
plane. A point P(x, y) on the plane is a lattice point if both x and y are integers.
Hence lattice points are traces of vertices of V .
Deﬁnition 1. ([1]) Two points P and Q in the plane are equivalent, denoted
by P ≡Q, if either the midpoint of the segment between them is a lattice point
or if both the diﬀerences between corresponding coordinates are even integers.
Proposition 4. ([1]) A tile T in the plane is a development of V if and only if
T consists of all representatives of the equivalence classes deﬁned by Deﬁnition 1
such that no two points in its interior are equivalent.

Colorings of Tilings Derived from Developments
If there is a coloring with k colors for a tiling T , the tiling is said to be k-
colorable. The minimum of such k is called the chromatic number of the tiling
T , and is denoted by χ(T ).
In this section, V is a doubly covered square and T is a development of V in
the plane with orthogonal xy-coordinates. We denote by FA the set obtained by
a half-circular rotation of F about a point A in the plane, and by F + (a, b) the
translate {(x + a, y + b) : (x, y) ∈F}. We use the symbol Fo instead of FO.
Lemma 1. ([3]) The family
{T + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ} ∪{TA + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ}
is a tiling for any lattice point A in the plane.

Chromatic Numbers of Speciﬁed Isohedral Tilings

Proof. For any point P in the plane, there is a point Q in T which is equivalent
to P, which means the diﬀerences of corresponding xy-coordinates are even, or
the midpoint of P and Q is a lattice point. In the former case, P is in T +(2k, 2l)
for some k, l ∈ZZ.
In the latter case, the point R symmetric to Q about A is in TA and the
diﬀerences of corresponding xy-coordinates of P and R are even, so P is in
TA + (2k, 2l) for some k, l ∈ZZ.
Therefore, the family of {T + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ} ∪{TA + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ}
covers the plane. Since the interior of T has no two equivalent points, the family
is a tiling.
⊓⊔
Let A be a lattice point in the plane with xy-coordinates. Then the tiling T =
{T + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ} ∪{TA + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ} does not depend on the
choice of A, so we call T the stamp method tiling by T .
Lemma 2. Let A be a leaf-point of ∂T . Then the boundary ∂(T ∪TA) is a simple
closed curve and the point A is an interior point of T ∪TA.
Proof. Let A be a leaf-point of ∂T . Put marks on all points which are leaf-points
or singular points in ∂T . Then the point A is marked and there are two marked
points P, Q which are next to the point A along the simple closed curve ∂T .
Since A is a leaf-point of ∂T , P and Q are symmetric about the point A and
they are equivalent (Fig.2(a)). The boundary ∂(T ∪TA) is the curve obtained
by removing ∂T ∩∂TA from ∂T ∪∂TA and adding P, Q. Hence ∂(T ∪TA) is a
simple closed curve. Then the point A is in the interior of T ∪TA.
⊓⊔
Deﬁnition 2. Let A(0, 0) and B(m, n) be distinct leaf-points of ∂T , whose exis-
tence is guaranteed by Proposition 2. We denote the set of all lattice points with
even coordinates by W = {(2k, 2l : k, l ∈ZZ}.
Two points Pi(2ki, 2li) ∈W (i = 1, 2) are called (m, n)-equivalent, denoted by
P1 ≡(m,n) P2 if (2k1 −2k2, 2l1 −2l2) = (tm, tn) for some integer t.
Since the relation ≡(m,n) is an equivalence relation on W, the set W is classi-
ﬁed into the equivalence classes {Cα}α∈Λ, where we denote by Co the class with
the origin O(0, 0).
Lemma 3. Let A = O(0, 0) and B(m, n) be leaf-points of ∂T . Let
Fα =

(a,b)∈Cα
{T ∪To + (a, b)}
for α ∈Λ.
(1) Fα = Fo + (a, b) for any α ∈Λ and any (a, b) ∈Cα.
(2) The boundary of Fα (α ∈Λ) consists of two disjoint simple curves.
(3) The union of all Fα (α ∈Λ) covers the plane.
(4) The interiors of Fα and Fβ are disjoint for any distinct α, ̸= β ∈Λ.
Proof. Let A = O(0, 0) and B(m, n) be leaf-points of ∂T .
(1) By Fo = {T ∪To + (2mt, 2nt) : t ∈ZZ} we have
Fα =

{T ∪To + (a, b) + (2mt, 2nt) : t ∈ZZ} = Fo + (a, b) .
for any (a, b) ∈Cα.

(2) Since the origin (0, 0) is an interior point of T ∪To by Lemma 2, all points in
Co = {(2mt, 2nt) : t ∈ZZ} are in the interior of Fo = {T ∪To + (2mt, 2nt) :
t ∈ZZ}. Since the point B(m, n) is a leaf-point of ∂T , the point B is in the
interior of T ∪TB = T ∪{To + (2m, 2n)} by Lemma 2. Hence all points in
the set {(2t + 1)m, (2t + 1)n : t ∈ZZ} are in the interior of Fo.
We can draw a simple curve in the interior of Fo which passes through
all points {(mt, nt) : t ∈ZZ}. Using a process similar to the one used in the
proof of Lemma 2, we can prove that for each family
{(T ∪To) + (2mt, 2nt) : t = 0, ±1, ±2, . . ., ±n} (n ∈IN),
the boundary of its union is a simple closed curve.
Therefore, the boundary of Fo consists of two disjoint simple curves. Since
Fα = Fo + (a, b) for (a, b) ∈Cα (α ∈Λ), the boundary of Fα consists of two
disjoint simple curves.
(3) Since

{Fα : α ∈Λ}=

{T ∪To+(a, b) : (a, b)∈W}=

{T ∪To+(2k, 2l) : k, l∈ZZ}
and the family {T ∪To + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ} is a tiling, the union of all Fα
covers the plane.
(4) Since the family {T ∪To + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ} is a tiling, the interiors of any
two distinct sets Fα, Fβ (α ̸= β) are disjoint.
⊓⊔
Deﬁnition 3. We deﬁne an inﬁnite graph G = GT as follows:
(1) The set of vertices in G consists of all elements of the tiling
{T + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ} ∪{To + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ}.
(2) Two vertices in G are joined by an edge if and only if the intersection of
corresponding congruent copies of T has the topological dimension one.
Proposition 5. We can draw the graph G = GT satisfying the following condi-
tions:
(1) G is a geometric planar graph in the plane.
(2) G is symmetric about the origin.
(3) The translate G + (2k, 2l) is identical to G for any k, l ∈ZZ.
Proof. (1) holds by the deﬁnition of G. (2) holds because the tiling
{T + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ} ∪{To + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ}
is symmetric with respect to the origin. (3) holds by Lemma 3(1).
⊓⊔
Let A = O(0, 0) and B(m, n) be distinct leaf-points of ∂T . Denote by Go the
induced subgraph of GT by the set of vertices corresponding to
{T + (2km, 2ln) : k, l ∈ZZ} ∪{To + (2km, 2ln) : k, l ∈ZZ}.

Proposition 6. Let A = O(0, 0) and B(m, n) be distinct leaf-points of ∂T . The
induced subgraph Go is either an inﬁnite path, or the graph consisting of an
inﬁnite path and additional edges which connect any two vertices with distance
two in the inﬁnite path (Fig. 3).
Proof. Since the interior of Fo is connected, Go contains an inﬁnite path. If Go
has an edge joining two points with distance greater than two in the inﬁnite
path, then some edges are crossing each other in their interiors by condition (3)
in Proposition 5, which is a contradiction since G is a geometric planar graph.
So, Go is either an inﬁnite path or a graph isomorphic to the graph in Fig. 3.
⊓⊔
Proposition 7. Suppose Go is an inﬁnite path. Then the graph G is isomorphic
to either a subgraph of the graph H1 or a subgraph of the graph H2 shown in
Fig. 4(a)(b).
Proof. Since G is a geometric planar graph and satisﬁes conditions in Proposi-
tion 5, we get the graphs H1 and H2 in Fig. 4(a)(b) by drawing as many edges
as possible among vertices in inﬁnitely many translates of Go. H1 and H2 are
maximal graphs, so the graph G is isomorphic to one of their subgraphs.
⊓⊔
Proposition 8. Suppose Go is a graph isomorphic to the graph in Fig. 3. Then
the graph G is isomorphic to a subgraph of the graph H3 showed in Fig. 4(c)
(see Fig. 5for an example).
Proof. Since G is a geometric planar graph and satisﬁes conditions in Proposition
5, we get the graph in Fig. 4(c) by drawing as many edges as possible. This graph
H3 is a maximal graph.
Theorem 1. For every development T of a doubly covered square V there is an
isohedral tiling F consisting of congruent copies of T which is three-colorable,
that is, χ(F) ≤3.

Proof. It is easy to see that graphs H1, H2 and H3 in Fig. 4 are three-colorable.
Since GT is isomorphic to a subgraph of these graphs, GT is also three-colorable.
Therefore the tiling
F = {T + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ}

{To + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ}
is three-colorable.
Corollary 1. Let T be a development of the doubly covered square V in the
plane with xy-coordinates. Let A = O(0, 0) and B(m, n) be leaf-points of the
boundary ∂T . Then m and n are relatively prime.
Proof. If there is a common divisor s > 1 of m and n, then Co = {(2mt, 2nt : t ∈
ZZ} and Co + (2m/s, 2n/s) are distinct classes with respect to the equivalence
relation ≡(m,n). Since there is a simple curve Γ joining all points {mt, nt) : t ∈
ZZ} in the interior of Fo = {T ∪To + (2mt, 2nt) : t ∈ZZ} by Lemma 3(2),
the translate Γ + (2m/s, 2n/s) is a simple curve joining all points in the class
C(2m/s,2n/s) by Lemma 3(1)(2), which contradicts Lemma 3(4).

Chromatic Numbers of Speciﬁed Isohedral Tilings
We denote by Π(e1, e2) the plane with oblique coordinates determined by two
independent unit vectors e1, e2 whose lengths are not necessary equal. We can
generalize Theorem 1 as follows:
Theorem 2. Let T be an isohedral tiling of a single tile T with two translations
by independent vectors 2e1, 2e2 and half-turn symmetry about lattice points in
Π(e1, e2). Then F is three-colorable, that is, χ(T ) ≤3.

Chromatic Numbers of Speciﬁed Isohedral Tilings
21
Proof. Let T be an isohedral tiling of a single tile T with two translations by
independent vectors 2e1, 2e2 and half-turn symmetry about lattice points in
Π(e1, e2). Let ψ be the aﬃne transformation deﬁned by the inverse of the matirix
(e1, e2). Then the image of T is a tiling in the plane and it is represented by
{ψ(T ) + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ} ∪{ψ(T )o + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ}
in the plane with orthogonal xy-coordinates. By Proposition 4, the image of T
by ψ is a development of a doubly covered square. Hence the image of T by ψ
is three-colorable by Theorem 1, so χ(T ) ≤3.
⊓⊔
A doubly covered square may be considered as a tetrahedron consisting of four
congruent isosceles right triangular faces.
Corollary 2. For every development T of a tetrahedron consisting of four con-
gruent acute triangular faces, there is an isohedral tiling T consisting of congru-
ent copies of T satisfying χ(F) ≤3.
Proof. It is proved in [4,5] that every development T of a tetrahedron consisting
of four congruent acute triangular faces is described in the plane with obilique
coordinates and it has an isohedral tiling consisting of congruent copies of T
satisfying all conditions in Theorem 2. Hence χ(F) ≤3 by Theorem 2.
⊓⊔
Conjecture 1. The chromatic numbers of isohedral tilings of the plane are at
most three.

Self-replicating Tiles and Fractals
We mentioned self-replicating tiles and fractals derived from a development of
a doubly covered square in [3,4]. We continue the discussion of this subject in
this section. Let A(a, b) be a lattice point in the plane Π(e1, e2) where e1, e2 are
relatively orthogonal vectors. We denote coordinates by (a, b)(e1,e2) instead of
(a, b) when necessary.
Theorem 3. ([4]) Let T be a development of a doubly covered square V in the
plane with xy-coordinates so that the origin is a leaf-point of ∂T . Then the union
T ∪To is a development of a doubly covered square whose faces are congruent to
the square ABCD, where A(0, −1), B(−1, 0), C(0, 1), D(1, 0) (Fig. 6).
Proof. Let u1, u2 be basic vectors in the plane with xy-coordinates. Rotate u1, u2
by π/4, multiply their lengths by
√
2 and denote the resulting vectors by e1, e2
respectively. Let Π(e1, e2) be the plane with the origin O(0, 0)(e1,e2) = O(0, 1).
Then all lattice points in Π(e1, e2) are also lattice points in the plane with xy-
coordinates. Since the origin is a leaf-point of ∂T , the origin O(0, 0) is an interior
point of T ∪To by Lemma 2.
Let S = T ∪To. The symbol So stands for SO(e1,e2). Since
{S ∪So + (2k, 2l)(e1,e2) : k, l ∈ZZ} = {T ∪To + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ}

{S ∪So + (2k, 2l)(e1,e2) : k, l ∈ZZ}
is also a tiling. By Proposition 4, S = T ∪To is a development of a dou-
bly covered square whose faces are congruent to the square ABCD, where
A(0, −1), B(1, 0), C(0, 1), D(−1, 0).
⊓⊔
We call a tile T in the plane a k-omino if T consists of k congruent squares and
if the intersection of any two of those squares is a point, one edge or empty.
Deﬁnition 4. Let T be a development of a doubly covered square V in the plane
with xy-coordinates. Suppose T be a k-omino. We deﬁne Condition 1 as follows:
Condition 1. Four points (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1) and (1, 0) are leaf-points of ∂T and
they are mid-points of some edges of squares in the k-omino T (Fig. 7(a)).
Deﬁnition 5. ([4]) Let T and S be developments of V in the plane with xy-
coordinates. Suppose T and S are a k1-omino and a k2-omino respectively, and
they satisfy Condition 1. Reduce V and T by the ratio 1/√k2 and denote the
resulting ﬁgures by V ∗and T ∗respectively. Then T ∗is a development of V ∗.
Assign the labels a, b, c, d to the four points in ∂T ∗corresponding to leaf-points
of ∂T in clockwise order along the boundary curve. Let F be a square in k2-
omino S with the origin. Then F is a development of V ∗. We deﬁne a set S(T )
as follows.
Step (1) Draw tilted squares by connecting midpoints of four edges in each square
in the k2-omino of S (Fig. 7(a)). Assign the labels a, b, c, d to vertices of
each tilted square in clockwise order, where the origin is assigned by a.
Then the assignment is unique because it is similar to part of the stamp
method tiling by the development F of V ∗(Fig. 7(a)).
Step (2) Replace each square in the k2-omino S by a congruent copy of T ∗such
that four labels a, b, c, d are matched to the same labels on each square
of S. We denote the resulting ﬁgure by S(T ) (Fig. 7(b) where S = T ).
Lemma 4. Let T, S be developments of V in the plane with xy-coordinates. Sup-
pose T, S are k1-omino and k2-omino respectively and they satisfy Condition 1.
Then S(T ) is another development of V which is a k1k2-omino and satisﬁes
Condition 1.

Fig. 7. The process to get S(T)
Proof. Let e1, e2 be two orthogonal vectors parallel to edges in the tilted squares
in S with lengths equal to the lengths of the edges of the tilted squares (for
example, unit vectors of XY -coordinates in Fig. 7(d)). Then if two points P
and Q are equivalent in the plane with xy-coordinates, then P and Q are also
equivalent in Π(e1, e2). By the deﬁnition of S(T ), S(T ) consists of a subfamily
of the stamp method tiling by T ∗. Since the family {S ∪So + (2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ}
is a tiling, forming the elements of the tiling
{T ∗+ (2k, 2l)(e1,e2) : k, l ∈ZZ} ∪{(T ∗)o + (2k, 2l)(e1,e2) : k, l ∈ZZ}
into groups by ﬁgures congruent to S(T ), we obtain the family {S(T )∪(S(T ))o+
(2k, 2l) : k, l ∈ZZ}, which is a tiling. By Proposition 4, S(T ) is a development of
V . Moreover, S(T ) is a k1k2-omino and it satisﬁes Condition 1 by the deﬁnition
of S(T ).
⊓⊔
Deﬁnition 6. Let T be a development of a doubly-covered square V . Suppose
T is a k-omino and it satisﬁes Condition(1). Deﬁne a sequence {Tn}n∈IN as
follows:
(1) T1 = T .
(2) For n ≥1, Tn+1 = T (Tn).
A tile F is called self-replicating or k-replicating if there are k congruent copies
of F such that interiors of any two of them are disjoint and that their union is
similar to the original ﬁgure F. The k-replicating tile F is called three-colorable
if there is an assignment of three colors to these k congruent copies of F so that
any two adjacent copies have diﬀerent colors.
Theorem 4. ([4]) Let T be a development of the doubly covered square V . Sup-
pose T is a k-omino satisfying Condition 1. Then the sequence {Tn}n∈IN con-
verges to a tile, denoted by T∞, in the Hausdorﬀ-metric for compact sets in
the plane and T∞is a development of V . Moreover, T∞is k-replicating and
three-colorable.
Proof. Let T be a development of the doubly covered square V which is a k-
omino satisfying Condition 1. By Lemma 4 the sequence {Tn}n∈IN is well-deﬁned.

For n ≥1 the Hausdorﬀ-metric distance between Tn and Tn+1 is less than
(1/
√
k)nc where c is a constant. So {Tn}n∈ZZ is a Cauchy-sequence and it con-
verges to a compact set T∞. The sequence of their boundaries {∂Tn}n∈IN also
converges to a simple closed curve. Hence T∞is a tile and a development of V .
For T∞, there are k congruent copies T = {Fi}k
i=1 of T∞so that their union is
similar to T∞and it is a subfamily of the stamp method tiling by T∞. Hence T
is three-colorable.
⊓⊔
A simple curve Γ in the plane is called a fractal if its Hausdorﬀ-dimension is
greater than one. Let T be the development of V in Fig. 6(a). In each step of
the construction for the sequence {Tn}n∈IN, enlarging the ﬁgure by the ratio
√
5
results in the boundary ∂Tn+1 whose the total length is three times that of ∂Tn.
Hence the Hausdorﬀ-dimension of the boundary ∂T∞is log√
5 3. The boundary
of T∞is fractal.
Remark. Let a k-omino T be a development of a doubly covered square V in the
plane with xy-coordinates. Deﬁne Condition 2 as follows:
Condition 2. Four points (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1) and (1, 0) are leaf-points of ∂T and
they are vertices of some squares in the k-omino, and T is symmetry by half-turn
about the point (1/2, 1/2).
Then all statements in this section hold for T satisfying Condition 2 instead of
Condition 1. Proofs are almost the same as above, so we omit them.

Abstract. Let G and H be two graphs with the same vertex set V . It
is well known that a graph G can be transformed into a graph H by
a sequence of 2-switches if and only if every vertex of V has the same
degree in both G and H. We study the problem of ﬁnding the minimum
number of 2-switches for transforming G into H.

Introduction
A graphic sequence is the sequence of numbers that are vertex degrees of a
graph. Any degree sequence whose sum is even can be realized by a multigraph
having loops [3]. In this paper we consider simple graphs (graphs without loops
and multiple edges). Erd˝os and Gallai [2] found a characterization of graphic
sequences.
Theorem 1 (Erd˝os and Gallai [2]). A sequence of positive numbers d1 ≥
d2 ≥· · · ≥dn is graphic if and only if d1 + d2 + · · · + dn is even and the
inequalities
k

i=1
di ≤k(k −1) +
n

i=k+1
min{k, di}
hold for every k.
Havel [4] and Hakimi [3] found another characterization of graphic sequences.
Theorem 2 (Havel [4], Hakimi [3]). For n ≥1, a sequence S of n nonneg-
ative integers is graphic if and only if S′ is graphic, where S′ is the sequence of
size n −1 obtained from S by deleting its largest element d and subtracting 1
from its d next largest elements. The only 1-element graphic sequence is d1 = 0.
The following transformation of a graph preserves the degree sequence.
Deﬁnition 1. A 2-switch is the replacement of a pair of edges (a, b) and (c, d)
in a simple graph by the edges (a, c) and (b, d), given that (a, c) and (b, d) did
not appear in the graph originally.

It is clear that the degrees of the vertices remain unchanged when a 2-switch is
applied to a graph. The following theorem shows that two graphs with the same
graphic sequence can be transformed one to the other using 2-switches.
Theorem 3. If G and H are two simple graphs with vertex set V , then dG(v) =
dH(v) for every v ∈V if and only if there is a sequence of 2-switches that
transforms G into H.
Note that the graphs G and H have the same set of vertices. It can also be
viewed as two labelled graphs with the same set of labels.
Probably the earliest reference of Theorem 3 is Berge [1] stating that the 2-
switch graph on the set of graphs with ﬁxed degree sequence is connected. It
also can be found in West [5, page 45]. Some feel that this is ”implicit” in the
work of Havel and Hakimi [6]. In the proof of Theorem 3 both G and H are
reduced to a canonical graph with vertex set V . Each reduction uses at most
m −1 transformations where m is the number of edges in G (see more details
in Section 2). Thus, the number of 2-switches transforming G to H is at most
2m −2. Finding the minimum number of 2-switches transforming given G and
H is of particular interest of this paper.
Let G = (V, EG) and H = (V, EH) be two simple graphs such that dG(v) =
dH(v) for every v ∈V . We consider a new graph F(G, H) or just F deﬁned as
(V, EF ) where EF = EG ∪EH −EG ∩EH. We color the edges of F with two
colors as follows. An edge e is colored in (i) red if e ∈EG −EH, and (ii) blue if
e ∈EH −EG. The number of red edges and the number of blue edges in F are
equal. We denote it by r(G, H).
The set of edges of F can be decomposed into red-blue alternating walks (note
that the vertices of a walk may not be pairwise distinct). Let p(G, H) be the
maximum number of walks in a decomposition of a F into red-blue alternating
walks. Our main result is the following theorem.
Theorem 4. Let G = (V, EG) and H = (V, EH) be two simple graphs such
that dG(v) = dH(v) for every v ∈V . The smallest number of 2-switches for
transforming G into H is equal to r(G, H) −p(G, H).

Preliminaries
Let G = (V, EG) and H = (V, EH) be two simple graphs such that dG(v) = dH(v)
for every v ∈V . We consider a new graph F(G, H) or just F deﬁned as (V, EF )

where EF = EG ∪EH −EG ∩EH. We color the edges of F with two colors as
follows. An edge e is colored in
– red if e ∈EG −EH,
– blue if e ∈EH −EG.
We call the coloring of F even since, for any vertex v, equal number of red
and blue edges are incident to v. It implies that the number of red edges and the
number of blue edges in F are equal. We denote it by r(G, H). We also consider
the complete graph Kn with the set of vertices V . Clearly, F is the subgraph
of Kn. We color the edges of Kn: the common edges of F and Kn are colored
in red and blue as before and the other edges are colored in black and white as
follows. An edge e is colored in
– black if e ∈EH ∩EG,
– white if e /∈EG ∪EH.
Since the coloring of F is even, the set of edges of F can be decomposed into
red-blue alternating walks. A walk is not a simple path since some vertices may
be repeated. We assume that the edges in a walk are all distinct.
The proof Theorem 3 uses a canonical graph C with vertex set V deﬁned
inductively as follows. Let v1, v2, . . . , vn be the vertices of V sorted such that
their degrees form a non-increasing sequence d(v1) ≥d(v2) ≥. . . d(vn). Consider
the sequence
d(v2) −1, d(v3) −1, . . . , d(vk+1) −1, d(vk+2), . . . , d(vn)
where k = d(v1). By Theorem 2 it is a graphic sequence. Let C′ be a canonical
graph corresponding to it. Then C is obtained from C′ by adding a new vertex
v1 and edges (v1, v2), (v1, v3), . . . , (v1, vk+1).
The main argument in the proof of Theorem 3 is as follows. Consider two
sets S = {v2, v3, . . . , vk+1} and N(v1), the set of neighbors of v1. If S = N(v1),
then the theorem holds by induction hypothesis. If S ̸= N(v1), then any edge
connecting v1 and a vertex z /∈S can be ﬂipped to an edge connecting v1 and a
vertex x ∈S −N(v1) using a 2-switch. By repeating this step we spend at most
k transformations for the induction step. With every 2-switch we insert a new
edge of the canonical graph C. In the last 2-switch we add two edges of C. So,
the total number of 2-switches is at most m −1.
This gives an upper bound of 2m −2 for transformation the graph G to H.
Theorem 4 implies that, if m > 0, then at most (m −1) 2-switches suﬃce since
r(G, H) ≤m and p(G, H) ≥1.
3
Main Result
Our main result characterizes the 2-switch distance between two graphs. We
denote the distance by ψ(G, H) = r(G, H) −p(G, H). First, we prove lower and
upper bounds for 2-switches.

and thin respectively. Black and white edges are shown as dashed lines, bold and thin
respectively. The edges (a, b) and (c, d) are red and the edges (a, c) and (b, d) are (a)
both blue, and (b) blue and white, and (c),(d) both white.
Lemma 1 (Lower Bound). Let G′ be the graph obtained by a 2-switch from
G. Then
ψ(G′, H) ≥ψ(G, H) −1.
(1)
Proof. Consider any 2-switch of edges ab and cd by the edges ac and bd. The
edges ab and cd are colored in red or black each. The edges ac and bd are colored
in blue or white each. Let C′ be a partition of F(G′, H) into p(G′, H) alternating
walks.
Case 1. Both edges (a, b) and (c, d) are red
Suppose that the colors of (a, c) and (b, d) are blue, see Fig. 2 (a). Then r(G, H) =
r(G′, H) + 2. The walks of C′ and abdca form a partition of the set of edges of
F(G, H) into alternating walks. Therefore p(G, H) ≥p(G′, H) + 1. The bound
(1) follows.

Transforming Graphs with the Same Degree Sequence
29
Suppose that the colors of (a, c) and (b, d) are blue and white respectively, see
Fig. 2 (b). Then r(G, H) = r(G′, H) + 1. One of the walks of C′ contains (b, d).
We replace (b, d) with bacd to obtain the set of alternating walks for F(G, H).
Thus p(G, H) ≥p(G′, H). The bound (1) follows.
Suppose that the colors of (a, c) and (b, d) are white, see Fig. 2 (c). Then
r(G, H) = r(G′, H). If the red edges (a, c) and (b, d) belong to diﬀerent walks
C1 and C2 of C′, then C1 −{(a, c)} and C2 −{(b, d)} can be combined in one
alternating walk with (a, b) and (c, d) in F(G, H), see Fig. 2 (c). Thus p(G, H) ≥
p(G′, H) −1. The bound (1) follows.
If the red edges (a, c) and (b, d) are connected in one alternating walk C, then
p(G, H) ≥p(G′, H) + 1, see Fig. 2 (d). The bound (1) follows.
Case 2. The edge (a, b) is red and the edge (c, d) is black
Suppose that the colors of (a, c) and (b, d) are blue, see Fig. 3 (a). Then r(G, H) =
r(G′, H) + 1. By replacing the edge (c, d) in an alternating walk from C′ by cabd
we bound p(G, H) ≥p(G′, H). The bound (1) follows.
Suppose that the colors of (a, c) and (b, d) are blue and white respectively,
see Fig. 3 (b). Then r(G, H) = r(G′, H). If the edges (b, d) and (c, d) are in two
alternating walks C1 and C2 of C′, then they can be combined in one alternating

and (c, d) are in a same alternating walk, then they can be replaced by (a, b)
and (a, c). In both cases p(G, H) ≥p(G′, H) −1. The bound (1) follows.
Suppose that the colors of (a, c) and (b, d) are white, see Fig. 3 (e). Then
r(G, H) = r(G′, H)−1. To bound p(G, H) we check the walks of C′ containing the
edges (a, c), (c, d) and (b, d). If there are three walks, then they can be combined
in one walk for G, see Fig. 3 (e). The number of walks can be two or one, see
Fig. 3 (f). In all cases p(G, H) ≥p(G′, H) −2 and the bound (1) follows.
Case 3. The edges (a, b) and (c, d) are black
Suppose that the colors of (a, c) and (b, d) are blue, see Fig. 4 (a). Then r(G, H) =
r(G′, H) and p(G, H) ≥p(G′, H) −1 by an argument similar to Case 1 where
(a, c) and (b, d) are white. The bound (1) follows.
Suppose that the colors of (a, c) and (b, d) are blue and white respectively,
see Fig. 4 (b). Then r(G, H) = r(G′, H) −1 and p(G, H) ≥p(G′, H) −2 by
an argument similar to Case 2 where (a, c) and (b, d) are white. The bound (1)
follows.
Suppose that the colors of (a, c) and (b, d) are white, see Fig. 4 (c). Then
r(G, H) = r(G′, H) −2. If abcda is a walk of C′, then p(G, H) ≥p(G′, H) −1. If

then p(G, H) ≥p(G′, H) −3, see Fig. 4 (f). In all cases p(G, H) ≥p(G′, H) −3
and the bound (1) follows.

Lemma 2 (Upper Bound). Let G = (V, EG) and H = (V, EH) be two simple
graphs such that dG(v) = dH(v) for every v ∈V . There exists a 2-switch in G
or H that decreases the distance ψ(G, H) by exactly one.
Proof. The graph F(G, H) can be partitioned into p(G, H) alternating walks.
From all partitions of F(G, H) into p(G, H) alternating walks, we select a par-
tition C such that its shortest walk C = v1v2 . . . vk has minimum length.
Suppose that |C| = 4. We apply a 2-switch in G replacing edges (v1, v2) and
(v3, v4) with (v1, v2) and (v3, v4). Let G′ be the new graph. Then r(G′, H) =
r(G, H) −2 and p(G′, H) = p(G, H) −1. Thus, ψ(G′, H) = ψ(G, H) −1.
Now suppose that |C| ≥6. Then v1 ̸= v4 or v2 ̸= v5 since the edges (v1, v2
and (v4, v5) have diﬀerent colors, see Fig. 5 (a). Without loss of generality we
assume that v1 ̸= v4. We consider 4 cases depending on the color of (v1, v4).
Suppose that (v1, v4) is red. Let C′ be a walk in C containing (v1, v4). The
edges of C∪C′ can be partitioned into two walks so that one walk is v1v4v5 . . . vk,
see Fig. 5 (b). This walk is shorter than C′. Contradiction.

If (v1, v4) is blue, then again C ∪C′ can be partitioned into two walks so that
one walk is 4-cycle v1v2v3v4, see Fig. 5 (c).
If (v1, v4) is white, then apply a 2-switch in G replacing edges (v1, v2) and
(v3, v4) with (v1, v4) and (v2, v3). If (v1, v4) is black, then apply a 2-switch in
G replacing edges (v1, v4) and (v2, v3) with (v1, v2) and (v3, v4). In both cases
this reduces v1v2v3v4 in C to v1v4. Let G′ be the new graph. Then r(G′, H) =
r(G, H) −1 and p(G′, H) = p(G, H), see Fig. 6. The lemma follows.
⊓⊔
Theorem 4 simply follows from the upper and lower bounds.

Abstract. Let G = (V, E) be a graph and F ⊆V . Then F is called
an induced forest of G if G[F] is acyclic. The forest number, denoted by
f(G), of G is deﬁned by
f(G) := max{|F| : F is an induced forest of G}.
We proved that if G runs over the set of all graphs of order n and size
m, then the values f(G) completely cover a line segment [x, y] of positive
integers. Let G(n, m) be the set of all graphs of order n and size m and
CG(n, m) be the subset of G(n, m) consisting of all connected graphs. We
are able to obtain the extremal results for the forest number in the class
G(n, m) and CG(n, m).

Interpolation Theorems
We consider only ﬁnite simple graphs. Let G = (V, E) denote a graph with
vertex set V = V (G) and edge set E = E(G). The order and the size of G are
denoted by ν(G) = |V | and ε(G) = |E|, respectively. The degree of a vertex v of
a graph G is denoted by dG(v). The maximum degree and the minimum degree
of a graph G is usually denoted by Δ(G) and δ(G), respectively. If S ⊆V (G),
the graph G[S] is the subgraph induced by S in G and we use the notation ε(S)
for ε(G[S]). For a graph G and X ⊆E(G), G−X denotes the graph (V, E −X).
If X = {e}, we write G −e for G −{e}. For a graph G and X ⊆V (G), G −X is
the graph obtained from G by removing all vertices in X and all edges incident
with vertices in X. For a graph G and X ⊆E(G), G + X denotes the graph
(V, E ∪X). If X = {e}, we simply write G+e for G+{e}. Two graphs G and H
are disjoint if V (G) ∩V (H) = ∅. For any two disjoint graphs G and H, G ∪H
is deﬁned by V (G ∪H) = V (G) ∪V (H) and E(G ∪H) = E(G) ∪E(H) and the
union of p copies of G is denoted by pG. We can extend this deﬁnition to a ﬁnite
union of pairwise disjoint graphs.

Let G be the class of all simple graphs. A function π : G →ZZ is called a
graph parameter if π(G) = π(H) for all isomorphic graphs G and H. A graph
parameter π is called an interpolation graph parameter over J ⊆G if there exist
integers x and y such that
{π(G) : G ∈J } := [x, y] := {k ∈ZZ : x ≤k ≤y}.
If π is an interpolation graph parameter over J , then {π(G) : G ∈J } is uniquely
determined by min(π, J ) = min{π(G) : G ∈J } and max(π, J ) = max{π(G) :
G ∈J }.
For positive integers n and m (0 ≤m ≤

), let G(n, m) be the class of
all distinct spanning subgraphs of Kn and size m. Let CG(n, m) be the subset
of G(n, m) consisting of all connected graphs. We simply write min(π; n, m)
and max(π; n, m) for min(π, G(n, m)) and max(π, G(n, m)), respectively. Also we
write Min(π; n, m) and Max(π; n, m) for min(π, CG(n, m)) and max(π, CG(n, m)),
respectively.
Interpolation theorems for graph parameters may be divided into two parts,
the ﬁrst part deals with the question that given a graph parameter π and a
subset J of G, does π interpolate over J ? If π interpolates over J , then {π(G) :
G ∈J } is uniquely determined by min(π, J ) and max(π, J ). The second part
of the interpolation theorems for graph parameters is to ﬁnd min(π, J ) and
max(π, J ) for the corresponding interpolation graph parameters and this part
is the extremal problems in graph theory.
Several graph parameters over the class of all graphs with the same degree
sequence were proved to interpolate and were presented the two parts of the
interpolation theorems by the second author in [3].
Let G be a graph and F ⊆V (G). F is called an induced forest of G if G[F] is
an acyclic graph. The maximum cardinality of an induced forest of a graph G is
called the forest number of G and is denoted by f(G). That is
f(G) := max{|F| : F is an induced forest of G}.
The second author proved in [2] the following theorems.
Theorem 1. The forest number f is an interpolation graph parameter over
G(n, m).
⊓⊔
Theorem 2. The forest number f is an interpolation graph parameter over
CG(n, m).

Extremal Results
Note that f is an interpolation graph parameter over G(n, m) and CG(n, m). We
now answer the second part of interpolation theorem.
Let G be a graph and X, Y be disjoint nonempty subsets of V (G). Denote by
ε(X, Y ) the number of edges in G connecting vertices in X to vertices in Y.

The Forest Number of (n, m)-Graphs
35
Let G ∈G(n, m) and F be a maximum induced forest of G. Let |F| = a.
Therefore G −F has order n −a. An upper bound of m can be obtained by the
following inequality.
m = ε(G −F) + ε(G −F, F) + ε(F) ≤

+ a(n −a) + (a −1).
Let a = n −i for any i ∈{1, 2, . . ., n −2}. We get m ≤(i + 1)n −i2+3i+2
2
.
For an integer i = 1, 2, . . ., n −2, let Mn(n −i) = (i + 1)n −i2+3i+2
2
. It is
clear that Mn(n−i) is an integer. We can show that max(f; n, m) = n−i if and
only if Mn(n −i + 1) < m ≤Mn(n −i) by constructing a graph G ∈G(n, m)
with Mn(n −i + 1) < m ≤Mn(n −i) and f(G) = n −i as follows.
Let G be a graph with V (G) = X ∪Y where X = {v1, v2, . . . , vn−i}, Y =
{u1, u2, . . . , ui} and E(G) = {vjvj+1 : 1 ≤j ≤n−i−1}∪{uv : u, v ∈Y }∪{ujvk :
1 ≤j ≤i −1, 1 ≤k ≤n −i} ∪{uivk : 1 ≤k ≤m −Mn(n −i + 1) + 1}. It is
easy to check that f(G) = n −i and G ∈CG(n, m). Thus we have the following
theorem.
Theorem 3. Let n and m be integers satisfying 0 ≤m ≤

. Then max(f; n, m)
= n−i if and only if Mn(n−i+1) < m ≤Mn(n−i), and Max(f; n, m) = n−i
if and only if m ≥n −1 and Mn(n −i + 1) < m ≤Mn(n −i).
⊓⊔
The problem of ﬁnding min(f; n, m) is diﬃcult and ﬁnding Min(f; n, m) is even
more diﬃcult. In order to obtain the values of min(f; n, m), we ﬁrst ﬁnd the
minimum number of edges of a graph order n having the forest number a. Let
G(n; f = a) be the set of graphs of order n having the forest number a. It is clear
that G(n; f = a) ̸= ∅if and only if 2 ≤a ≤n. For integers n and a, let
mn(a) = min{ε(G) : G ∈G(n; f = a)}.
Further, mn(n) = 0, mn(n −1) = 3 and mn(2) =
n


. It is easy to see that
for a graph G of order n ≥2, f(G) = 2 if and only if G ∼= Kn. We now ﬁnd
mn(a) for 2 < a < n. The following lemma was proved in [1] which provide a
characterization of graphs with forest number 3.
Lemma 1. Let G be a graph of order n ≥3 and G ̸∼= Kn. Then f(G) = 3 if
and only if G is a union of stars.

By Lemma 1 we have mn(3) =

proved in [1] the following lemma.
Lemma 2. If G is a graph of order n with maximum degree Δ(G) = Δ, then
f(G) ≥
2n
Δ+1.
⊓⊔
Lemma 3. If G is a graph of order n with Δ(G) = Δ and f(G) = 2q + 1 for
some integer q, then n ≤(Δ + 1)q + 1.

Proof. We will proceed by induction on q. Suppose that n = (Δ + 1)q + t for
some integer t ≥2. Since f(G) = 2q + 1, it follows by Lemma 2 that 2 ≤t ≤Δ.
Suppose that q = 1, that is n = Δ+1+t. Thus δ(G) = t ≥2 and hence G is not
a union of stars. By Lemma 1, f(G) ≥4. Therefore the result holds for q = 1.
Suppose that there exists a graph G of order n = (Δ+1)q+t with f(G) = 2q+1
for smallest possible integer q ≥2. Let v be a vertex of G of degree Δ and let
H be the graph obtained from G by deleting v and its neighbors. Thus H has
order (Δ+1)(q −1)+t and by minimality of q, there exists a maximum induced
forest F in H of order at least 2(q −1) + 2 = 2q. Since Fv = F ∪{v} is an
induced forest of G and |Fv| = |F| + 1, it follows that |F| = 2q and Fv is a
maximum induced forest in G of order 2q + 1. Note that if T is a maximum
induced forest in a graph G and v ∈V (G −T ), then there exists a nontrivial
connected component C of T such that v is adjacent to at least 2 vertices in C.
Since Fv contains at most 2q vertices of degree at least 1 and G −Fv has order
(Δ −1)q + t −1, there are at least 2(Δ −1)q + 2(t −1) edges from G −Fv to
the nontrivial components of Fv. Since Fv has at most 2q vertices of degree at
least 1 and 2(Δ−1)q+2(t−1)
2q
> Δ −1, it follows that there exists a vertex in Fv of
degree at least Δ + 1. Thus we get a contradiction.
⊓⊔
By Lemma 2, we have a lower bound on the maximum degree of a given graph in
terms of its order and its forest number. In other words, if G is a graph of order
n, then Δ(G) ≥⌈2n
f(G)⌉−1. In particular, if f(G) = 2q for some integer q, then
Δ(G) ≥⌈n
q ⌉−1. By Lemma 3 the lower bound of Δ(G) can be improved if f(G)
is odd. That is, if f(G) = 2q + 1 for some integer q, then n ≤(Δ(G) + 1)q + 1
which is equivalent to Δ(G) ≥⌈n−1
q ⌉−1. We have the following corollary.
Corollary 1. Let G be a graph of order n and q be a positive integer. If f(G) =
2q, then Δ(G) ≥⌈n
q ⌉−1, and if f(G) = 2q + 1, then Δ(G) ≥⌈n−1
q ⌉−1.
⊓⊔
Let G∗(n; f = a) = {G ∈G(n; f = a) : G is a union of ⌈a
2⌉cliques}. It is clear
that G∗(n; f = a) ⊂G(n; f = a). We have the following theorem.
Theorem 4. Let G be a graph of order n with f(G) = a. Then there exists a
graph H ∈G∗(n; f = a) such that ε(H) ≤ε(G).
Proof. We will proceed by induction on n. The result holds for n = 1. Suppose
that n ≥2. If there exists a vertex v of G such that f(G−v) = f(G)−1 = a−1,
then, by induction, there exists a graph H′ ∈G∗(n −1; f = a −1) such that
ε(H′) ≤ε(G−v). Let H = H′∪{v}. Thus H ∈G∗(n; f = a) and ε(H) = ε(H′) ≤
ε(G −v) ≤ε(G). Suppose that for every vertex v of G, f(G −v) = f(G) = a.
Let v be a vertex of G of degree Δ(G). Thus, by induction, there exists a graph
H′ ∈G∗(n −1; f = a) such that ε(H′) ≤ε(G −v). We consider two cases.
Case 1. Suppose that f = 2q for some integer q. Thus H′ is a union of at
least q cliques. Therefore there exists a component C′ of H′ such that C′ is
a clique of order at most ⌊n−1
q ⌋. By Corollary 1, dG(v) ≥⌈n
q ⌉−1. Note that
⌈n
q ⌉−1 = ⌊n−1
q ⌋. Let C be a clique obtained from C′ by adding v and at most

⌊n−1
q ⌋edges from v to C′. Let H = (H′ −V (C′)) ∪C. Then H ∈G∗(n; f = a)
and ε(H) ≤ε(H′) + ⌊n−1
q ⌋≤ε(G −v) + dG(v) ≤ε(G), as required.
Case 2. Suppose that n ≥4 and f = 2q + 1 for some integer q. Thus H′ is a
union of at least q + 1 cliques one of which is an isolated vertex. Therefore there
exists a component C′ of H′ such that C′ is a nontrivial clique of order at most
⌊n−2
q ⌋. By Corollary 1, dG(v) ≥⌈n−1
q ⌉−1. Note that ⌈n−1
q ⌉−1 = ⌊n−2
q ⌋. Let C
be a clique obtained from C′ by adding v and at most ⌊n−2
q ⌋edges form v to C′.
Let H = (H′ −V (C′))∪C. Then H ∈G∗(n; f = a) and ε(H) ≤ε(H′)+⌊n−2
q ⌋≤
ε(G −v) + dG(v) ≤ε(G), as required.
⊓⊔
By Theorem 4, we know the structure of graphs of order n with prescribed
forest numbers. In general, for a graph G ∈G(n; f = a), there may be many
such graphs H ∈G∗(n; f = a). We now seek for such a graph H with minimum
number of edges.

Theorem 5 is the famous result of Tur´an [4] which is viewed as the origin of
extremal graph theory.
The Tur´an graph Tn,r is the complete r-partite graph of order n whose partite
sets diﬀer in size by at most 1. It is clear that the complement of the Tur´an graph
Tn,r is a union of r cliques.
Theorem 5. Among the graphs of order n containing no complete subgraph of
order r + 1, Tn,r has the maximum number of edges.
⊓⊔
By Theorem 5, we know that among the graphs of order n which is a union of
r cliques, the complement of the Tur´an graph Tn,r has the minimum number of
edges.
Tur´an theorem can be applied for ﬁnding mn(a) for 4 ≤a ≤n −1. We ﬁrst
establish certain facts and notation.
1. Let G = p1K1 ∪p3K3 ∪p4K4 ∪. . . ∪pkKk. Then the order of G is p1 + 3p3 +
4p4 + . . . + kpk and f(G) = p1 + 2(p3 + p4 + . . . + pk). Suppose that p1 ≥2,
pk ≥1 and k ≥4. Then by replacing 2K1 ∪Kk by K3 ∪Kk−1 we obtain a
graph H with ε(H) ≤ε(G). Furthermore, ε(H) = ε(G) if and only if k = 4.
2. mn(n −1) = 3 if n ≥4. Let G ∈G(n; f = n −1). Then ε(G) = 3 if and only
if n ≥4 and G = (n −3)K1 ∪K3.
3. Let a be an integer satisfying 2n
3 ≤a ≤n −1. If (p, q) is the solution of
p + 3q = n and p + 2q = a, then G = pK1 ∪qK3 satisﬁes f(G) = a.
4. Let a be an integer satisfying 2n
3 ≤a ≤n −2 and G ∈G(n; f = a) such
that ε(G) = mn(a). Then by Theorem 4, we can choose G = p1K1 ∪p3K3 ∪
p4K4 ∪. . . ∪pkKk ∈G∗(n; f = a) and k ≤4. If k = 4, then p1 ≥2. Thus by
the ﬁrst fact above, there exists a graph H = pK1∪qK3 such that p+3q = n,
p + 2q = a and ε(H) = ε(G) = mn(a).
5. Let a be an integer with a < 2n
3 and G ∈G(n; f = a). Then, by Lemma 2,
Δ(G) ≥3. Thus if G = p1K1 ∪p3K3 ∪p4K4 ∪. . . ∪pkKk, f(G) = a < 2n
3
and ε(G) = mn(a), then p1 ≤1 and k ≥4.

We now ﬁnd the minimum number of edges of a connected graph order n having
the forest number a. Let CG(n; f = a) be the set of connected graphs of order n
having the forest number a. For integers n and a, let
cmn(a) = min{ε(G) : G ∈CG(n; f = a)}.
Further, cmn(n) = n −1, cmn(2) =

Let CG∗(n; f = a) = {G ∈CG(n; f = a) : G is obtained from ⌈a
2⌉disjoint
cliques and ⌈a
2⌉−1 edges}. We have the following theorem.
Theorem 8. Let G be a connected graph of order n with f(G) = a. Then there
exists a graph H ∈CG∗(n; f = a) such that ε(H) ≤ε(G).
Proof. We will proceed by induction on n. The result holds for n = 1. Let n ≥2.
Suppose that there exists a vertex v of G such that f(G−v) = f(G)−1 = a−1.
Let G1, G2, . . . , Gk be the k components of G −v having n1, n2, . . . , nk vertices,
respectively. Then dG(v) ≥k. Thus for each i ∈{1, 2, . . ., k}, there exists a
graph Hi ∈CG∗(ni; f = f(Gi)) such that ε(Hi) ≤ε(Gi). Let wi ∈V (Hi) and
H = (H1 ∪H2 ∪. . . ∪Hk ∪{v}) + X where X = {vwi : i = 1, 2, . . ., k}. Then
H ∈CG∗(n; f = a) and ε(H) = k + k
i=1 ε(Hi) ≤dG(v) + k
i=1 ε(Gi) ≤ε(G).
Suppose that for every vertex v of G, f(G −v) = f(G) = a. Let v be a vertex
of G of degree Δ(G). We consider two cases.

The Forest Number of (n, m)-Graphs
39
Case 1.
G −v is connected. Then there exists a graph H′ ∈CG∗(n −1; f = a)
such that ε(H′) ≤ε(G−v). If f = 2q for some integer q, then H′ is obtained from
q disjoint cliques and q−1 edges. Therefore there exists a clique C′ of H′ of order
at most ⌊n−1
q ⌋. By Corollary 1, dG(v) ≥⌈n
q ⌉−1. Note that ⌈n
q ⌉−1 = ⌊n−1

C be a clique obtained from C′ by adding v and at most ⌊n−1

Then H ∈CG∗(n; f = a) and ε(H) ≤ε(G), as required.
If n ≥4 and f = 2q + 1 for some integer q, then H′ is obtained from q + 1
cliques and q edges where one of cliques is an isolated vertex. Therefore there
exists a non-trivial clique C′ of H′ of order at most ⌊n−2
q ⌋. By Corollary 1,
dG(v) ≥⌈n−1
q ⌉−1. Note that ⌈n−1
q ⌉−1 = ⌊n−2
q ⌋. Let C be a clique obtained
from C′ by adding v and at most ⌊n−2

V (H) = V (G) and E(H) = (E(H′) −E(C′)) ∪E(C). Then H ∈CG∗(n; f = a)
and ε(H) ≤ε(G), as required.
Case 2.
G −v is disconnected. Let G1, G2, . . . , Gk be the k components of
G −v having n1, n2, . . . , nk vertices, respectively. For each i ∈{1, 2, . . ., k}, we
put G′
i = G[V (Gi) ∪{v}] and G′ = G[V (G −Gi) ∪{v}]. Suppose that there
exists i; 1 ≤i ≤k such that f(G′
i) = f(Gi) + 1. Then f(G′
j) = f(Gj) for all
j ̸= i. Then G′ is a connected graph of order n′ = n −ni such that f(G′) =
f(k
i̸=j=1 Gj) = k
i̸=j=1 f(Gj). Thus for w ∈V (Gi), H∗= (Gi ∪G′) + {vw}
is a connected graph of order n such that ε(H∗) = ε(Gi) + ε(G′) + 1 ≤ε(G)
and f(H∗) = f(Gi) + f(G′) = k
j=1 f(Gj) = f(G −v) = a. Then there exist
Hi ∈CG∗(ni; f = f(Gi)) and H′ ∈CG∗(n′; f = f(G′)) such that ε(Hi) ≤ε(Gi)
and ε(H′) ≤ε(G′). Let w ∈V (Hi) and H = (Hi ∪H′) + {vw}. Then ε(H) =
ε(Hi) + ε(H′) + 1 ≤ε(Gi) + ε(G′) + 1 ≤ε(G) and f(H) = f(Hi) + f(H′) =
f(Gi) + f(G′) = f(G) = a. Thus H ∈CG∗(n; f = a) and ε(H) ≤ε(G), as
required.
Suppose that f(G′
i) = f(Gi) for all i ∈{1, 2, . . ., k}. If Gi is a complete
graph for all i, then G′
i is complete. Since Gi is complete, it follows that for any
e ∈E(Gi), f(Gi−e) = f(Gi)+1. Then for w ∈V (Gi), H∗= ((Gi−e)∪G′)+{vw}
is a connected graph of order n such that ε(H∗) = ε(Gi −e) + ε(G′) + 1 ≤ε(G)
and f(H∗) = f(Gi −e) + f(G′) = f(Gi) + f(G′) + 1 = k
j=1 f(Gj) = f(G). By
the same argument in the ﬁrst part of Case 2, there exists H ∈CG∗(n; f = f(G))
such that ε(H) ≤ε(G −e) < ε(G), as required.
Assume that there exists j; 1 ≤j ≤k such that Gj is not complete. Then
for any i ∈{1, 2, . . ., k} there exists Hi ∈CG∗(ni; f = f(Gi)) such that ε(Hi) ≤
ε(Gi). For wi ∈V (Hi), we put H∗= k
i=1 Hi + X where X = {vwi : i =
1, 2, . . ., k}. Then H∗is a connected graph of order n with ε(H∗) ≤ε(G) and
f(H∗) = k
i=1 f(Hi) = k
i=1 f(Gi) = k
i=1 f(G′
i) = f(G) = a.
We put H′
i = H∗[V (Hi) ∪{v}]. Then there exists i; 1 ≤i ≤k such that
f(H′
i) = f(Hi) + 1. By the same argument in the ﬁrst part of Case 2, there
exists H ∈CG∗(n; f = a) such that ε(H) ≤ε(H∗) ≤ε(G), as required.

Abstract. Given a simple polygon P with m vertices, a set X = {x1, x2,
..., xn} of n points within P, a start point s ∈X, and an end point t ∈X,
we give an O(n3 log m + mn) time, O(n3 + m) space algorithm to ﬁnd
O(n2) simple polygonal paths from s to t that have their vertices among
the points in X and stay inside P, or report that no such path exists.

Introduction
In this paper we study the following problem: Given a simple polygon P with
m vertices, a set X = {x1, x2, ..., xn} of n points within P, a start point s ∈X,
and an end point t ∈X, ﬁnd a simple polygonal path K from s to t (a path
without self-intersections) that has its vertices among the points in X and stays
inside P, or report that no such path exists (see Figure 1). The points in X are
allowed to be on the edges or at the vertices of P and a line segment of K can
be tangent to a vertex of P.
Obviously, if self-intersection is allowed then an s-to-t path with vertices in X
can be found by computing the visibility graph of X. However, in our problem,
self-intersections are not allowed. We also make the following simple observa-
tions: (1) While a shortest s-to-t path in P always exists, it is possible no simple
s-to-t path exists; (2) In general, a shortest s-to-t path in P, restricted to turn
only at points in X, is not a simple path, as illustrated in Figure 1; (3) If there
exists an s-to-t path that turns only at points in X then there exists a shortest
s-to-t path that turns only at points in X; (4) The existence of an s-to-t path
that turns only at points in X does not guarantee the existence of a simple
s-to-t path that turns only at points in X.
The problem we study is a special case of ﬁnding a simple path on points
while avoiding a set of obstacles in the plane. In our problem, the obstacle
set is the union of connected line segments. The problem, both in its general

Fig. 1. A simple s-to-t path that turns on points in X (bold line), a shortest s-to-t
path that turns on points in X and is not a simple path (dotted line), and the shortest
s-to-t path in P (bold dashed line)
form and in the special form studied in this paper, has been introduced in [3].
They have motivated it by its applications to polygon generation, where given
a set of points X inside a simple polygon P one wishes to generate simple, or
x-monotone, polygons with vertices in X [1, 3, 7].
In [3], they consider the problem of ﬁnding a simple path on points while
avoiding a set of obstacles in the plane and prove it is NP-complete for arbitrary
obstacles. For the special case when the obstacles form a simple polygon P and
X is in P, they give a polynomial, O(m2n2) time and space algorithm, based on
dynamic programming. Their dynamic programming solution is straightforward.
First, they pair the points of X with the vertices of P based on visibility: a point
is paired with a vertex if they are visible inside P. Each of the resulting pairs
corresponds to a vertex in a graph G, and G can have Ω(mn) vertices in the
worst case. Then, directed edges are added between vertices of G based on a
simple partition rule and there can be Ω(m2n2) edges in the worst case. The
graph is acyclic and an s-to-t path in G is the sought solution. Thus, recent
results on computing the visibility graph of X within P [2] would not help in
speeding up the algorithm in [3].
In contrast, for the special case of points within a simple polygon, we present
a new algorithm based on the construction of a pyramid graph. In this graph,
a node corresponds to a pair of points of X that can see each other in P. Two
nodes deﬁned by the oriented pairs (xi, xj) and (xj, xk) are connected by an edge
if xi and xk are not visible in P; in this case, the points xi, xj, and xk deﬁne a
pyramid. For example, in Figure 1, the points x1, x2, and t deﬁne a pyramid. The
algorithm requires O(n3 log m + nm) time and O(n3 + m) space. Our algorithm,
called MOD −SSSP, resembles a single source shortest path algorithm and is
executed on the pyramid graph of X (it requires the computation of the visibility
graph of points within a simple polygon [2, 4]). The key contribution is how to
make sure that when a line segment (u, v), with u, v ∈X, is added to the simple
path constructed so far, all possible simple paths which start at s and end at
u have been considered, and the line segment (u, v) does not intersect with at
least one of those simple paths. The foundation of our algorithm is given by an
interesting property that relates the shortest paths in P (without the restriction

that they turn at points in X) with simple paths in P that turn only at points
in X, that may be of more general interest. Intuitively, this property says that
a simple s-to-t path travels in the same “direction” as the shortest path (see
Lemma 5 and Lemma 7). Compared to the previous solution, our algorithm
reduces the space from O(m2n2) to O(n3) whenever m = ω(√n), and improves
over the running time whenever n = o( m2
log m). Moreover, it can report not only
one but O(n2) simple paths from s to t.
Overall, our solution proves other competitive approaches are possible, and
opens the door to more eﬃcient solutions for the problem addressed in this
paper.

Preliminaries
In this section, we give the deﬁnitions and notations that will be used in the
rest of the paper. For consistency, we use the same notations as in [3] whenever
possible.
Let P be a simple polygon and let ∂P be the boundary of P. Let X be a set
of n points inside P. Let [x, y] denote the line segment with endpoints x and y.
For a polygonal path K, K[x, y] denotes the sub-path of K between x and y.
Deﬁnition 1. A polygonal path K = x1x2 . . . xk, with vertices x1,x2,...,xk, is
called simple if it is homeomorphic to a line segment (in other words, K does not
intersect itself). When X is a ﬁnite set of points and s = x1, x2, . . . , xk = t ∈X,
K is called an (s, X, t)-path.
Deﬁnition 2. A path K = x1x2 . . . xk is called 3-shortcut-free if for any three
consecutive vertices xi−1, xi, and xi+1 of K, 2 ≤i ≤k −1, xi−1 and xi+1 are
visible to xi but xi−1 and xi+1 can not see each other in P.
For example, the simple (s, X, t) path in Figure 1 is a 3-shortcut-free path.
Deﬁnition 3. For three points xl, xp, and xq such that K = xlxpxq is a 3-
shortcut-free path, [xl, xp] [xp, xq] is called a pyramid, denoted as 
lpq or

xlxpxq;
the pyramid 
lpq is directed from l-to-p-to-q, and thus 
lpq ̸= 
qpl.
For example, the points x1, x2, and t in Figure 1 deﬁne the pyramid

x1x2x3. It
will become clear later on (see Deﬁnition 8 and Lemma 5) that the orientation
of the pyramids is crucial in solving the problem.
For any two points a, b in P, we denote the shortest (directed) path from a to
b inside P as −−−→
SPab. Notice that this path is not restricted to turn at points in X.
We assume that s and t are on a horizontal line, with s to the left of t. Consider
the shortest path −−→
SPst inside P and extend the ﬁrst and last line segments of
SPst until they intersect the boundary ∂P of P at points s′ and t′, respectively
(see Figure 1). The points s′ and t′ separate ∂P into an upper part, ∂PU, and
a lower part, ∂PL, while [s′s] ∪−−→
SPst ∪[tt′] splits P accordingly into two parts,
PU and PL.

For any two points a, b ∈∂PU (a, b may not be vertices of P), denote the
sub-path of ∂PU between a and b as ∂PU[a, b]. Similarly, for any two points a
and b on ∂PL denote the sub-path of ∂PL between a and b as ∂PL[a, b].
Deﬁnition 4. If a ∈∂PU[s′, b] we say that a is before b on ∂PU; else, a is after
b on ∂PU. Similarly, if a ∈∂PL[s′, b] we say that a is before b on ∂PL; else, a is
after b on ∂PL.
Deﬁnition 5. A separator S(a,b,c) is the union of two line segments [a, b]∪[b, c]
such that [a, b] ⊂P, [b, c] ⊂P, a is a vertex of ∂PU, c is a vertex of ∂PL, and b
is a point inside or on boundary of P.
Deﬁnition 6. A separator S(a,b,c) separates P into two parts. If one part in-
cludes s and the other part includes t, then S(a,b,c) is called st separator, denoted
as Sst
(a,b,c). The part including s is denoted as P s
(a,b,c) and the other part including
t is denoted as P t
(a,b,c).
Deﬁnition 7. For a 3-shortcut-free path K = x1x2 . . . xk, if we can ﬁnd a
set of st separators Sst
(ai,xi,ci) (i = 1, ..., k) such that P s
(a1,x1,c1) ⊂P s

P s

(ak−1,xk−1,ck−1) ⊂P t
(ak−2,xk−2,ck−2)
... ⊂P t
(a1,x1,c1), then K is an st oriented 3-shortcut-free path. If x1 = s or xk = t,
then Sst
(ai,xi,ci), for i = 1 or i = k, can be ignored.
Note that
[x1, x2] ⊂P t
(a1,x1,c1) ∩P s
(a2,x2,c2),
[x2, x3] ⊂P t
(a2,x2,c2) ∩P s

...,
[xk−1, xk] ⊂P t

Moreover, P s

(a2,x2,c2),...,P t
(ak−1,xk−1,ck−1) ∩P s
(ak,xk,ck),
P t
(ak,xk,ck) are interior disjoint and then an st oriented 3-shortcut-free path K =
x1x2 . . . xk is a simple path.
A pyramid

xlxpxq is a special case of 3-shortcut-free path with only three
vertices. We deﬁne the st oriented pyramid analogous to the deﬁnition of st
oriented 3-shortcut-free path.
Deﬁnition 8. A pyramid

xlxpxq is an st oriented pyramid if there exist three
st separators S(az,xz,cz)(z = l, p, q) such that P s
(al,xl,cl) ⊂P s
(ap,xp,cp) ⊂P s
(aq,xq,cq)
and P t
(aq,xq,cq) ⊂P t
(ap,xp,cp) ⊂P t
(al,xl,cl).
A shortest path −−−−→
SPxixj = xif1f2...fkxj is also a special 3-shortcut-free path,
having all internal vertices among the vertices of P. We deﬁne the st oriented
shortest path analogous to the deﬁnition of st oriented 3-shortcut-free path with
small modiﬁcations.

Deﬁnition 9. A shortest path −−−−→
SPxixj = xif1f2...fkxj is an st oriented short-
est path if there exists a set of st separators Sst
(ai,xi,ci), Sst
(al,fl,cl)(l = 1, ..., k),
Sst
(aj,xj,cj) such that fl = al or cl, P s

(aj,xj,cj) ⊂P t
(ak,fk,ck) ⊂P t
(ak−1,fk−1,ck−1)... ⊂P t
(ai,xi,ci).
Note that for all internal vertices of −−−−→
SPxixj, the st separator passing through
each internal vertex is a line segment since fl = al or cl.
Consider a pyramid 
lpq, and let f1, f2, . . . , fk be the interior vertices of −−−−→
SPxlxq.
Notice that −−−−→
SPxlxq is a convex chain.
Deﬁnition 10. If all f1, f2, . . . , fk are on ∂PU then 
lpq is an upper pyramid. If
all f1, f2, . . . , fk are on ∂PL then 
lpq is a lower pyramid. If some of f1, f2, . . . , fk
are on ∂PU and the others are on ∂PL, then 
lpq is a hybrid pyramid.
We can prove that hybrid pyramids do not exist in a simple 3-shortcut-free
(s, X, t)-path (see Lemma 3).

Properties
Lemma 1. Let Q be a simple polygon in P with vertices v1, v2, . . . , vk, k > 3.
Then, there exist at least two sets of three consecutive vertices vi−1, vi, vi+1,
and vj−1, vj, vj+1 of Q which do not form a pyramid, and such that vi and vj
are not adjacent vertices of Q.
Proof. Follows directly from Meister’s Two-Ears theorem: every polygon of n
vertices has at least two non-overlapping ears [5].
2
Lemma 2 below extends Lemma 1 in [3] to 3-shortcut-free paths.
Lemma 2. Let K = x1x2 . . . xk be a simple 3-shortcut-free path in P, and let
x, y ∈P be two points that are visible to each other in P. Let z1, z2, . . . , zj be the
intersection points of K with [x, y], listed in the order in which they appear on
K. Then z1, z2, . . . , zj must also appear on [x, y] in order, that is, zi is between
zi−1 and zi+1 for all i = 2, 3, . . ., j −1.
Proof. Suppose the ﬁrst intersection point which is not in order is zb, and the
intersection point before zb on K is za. K[za, zb]∪[za, zb] forms a simple polygon
Q. There are two cases:
1. zb is before z1 on [x, y]. There are two subcases:
(a) x1 is outside Q (see Figure 2). It is easy to see there exists a vertex xi
on K[z1, za] and another vertex xj on K[za, zb] such that xi and xj are
visible to each other. K[xi, xj] ∪[xi, xj] forms a simple polygon. From
Lemma 1, we know that at least one vertex of xi+1, . . . , xj−1 can not
form a pyramid with its neighboring vertices. This contradicts that K is
a simple 3-shortcut-free path.

on K[x1, za] and another vertex xj on K[za, zb] such that xi and xj are
visible to each other. K[xi, xj] ∪[xi, xj] forms a simple polygon. From
Lemma 1, we know at least one vertex of xi+1, . . . , xj−1 can not form
a pyramid with its neighboring vertices. This contradicts that K is a
simple 3-shortcut-free path.
2. zb is after z1 on [x, y]. Let zc be the intersection point before zb on [x, y] and
before zb on K. It is easy to see there exists a vertex xi on K[zc, za] and
another vertex xj on K[za, zb] such that xi and xj are visible to each other
(see Figure 4). K[xi, xj] ∪[xi, xj] forms a simple polygon. From Lemma 1,
we know that at least one vertex of xi+1, . . . , xj−1 can not form a pyramid
with its neighboring vertices. This contradicts that K is a simple 3-shortcut-
free path. If there are only two vertices xi, xi+1 on K[zc, zb] (see Figure 5),
then we can ﬁnd a vertex xj which is on K[zb, xk] and inside the triangle
Δzcxiza such that xi and xj are visible to each other. K[xi, xj] ∪[xi, xj]
forms a simple polygon. From Lemma 1, we know that at least one vertex

This concludes the proof of the lemma.

fact that K is a 3-shortcut-free path.

From Lemma 3, we know that hybrid pyramids can not appear in a simple 3-
shortcut-free (s, X, t)-path. We only need focus on lower and upper pyramids in
the remaining part of this paper.
Lemma 4. Let K = sx1 . . . xkt be a simple 3-shortcut-free path in P. Then K
can not cross [s, s′].
Proof. Let −−→
SPst be sf1f2...fkt. There are two cases:
1. sf1f2...fkt is a convex chain (see Figure 7). Suppose f1, f2, ..., fk ∈∂PL
(similar if f1, f2, ..., fk ∈∂PU). Shoot a ray −−→
s′f1 until it hits a point f ′
1 ∈∂PU.
Suppose K crosses [s, s′] at point a. Since K[a, t] need reach t, it has to cross
[f1, f ′
1]. Suppose the cross point is b. Then s, a, and b do not appear on
[s′, f ′
1] in order. This contradicts with Lemma 2.
2. f1, f2, ..., fi ∈∂PL and fi+1 ∈∂PU (see Figure 8). Then sf1f2...fifi+1 is a
convex chain. Shoot a ray −−→

reach t. But it has to cross [f1, f ′

with [f1, f ′
1] be b. Then s, a, and b do not appear on [s′, f ′

contradicts with Lemma 2.
Lemma 5. Let K = sx1 . . . xkt be a simple 3-shortcut-free path in P. Then K
is an st oriented 3-shortcut-free path and every pyramid on K is st oriented.
Proof. In order to prove that K is an st oriented 3-shortcut-free path, we need
to ﬁnd a sequence of st separators Sst
(ai,xi,ci) (i = 1, ..., k) such that [s, x1] ⊂
P s
(a1,x1,c1) ⊂P s
(a2,x2,c2)... ⊂P s
(ak,xk,ck) and [t, xk] ⊂P t
(ak,xk,ck) ⊂P t
(ak−1,xk−1,ck−1)
... ⊂P t
(a1,x1,c1).
For the ﬁrst pyramid

sx1x2, we can ﬁnd an st separator Sst
(a1,x1,c1) as follows.
Let −→
x1s be the ray originating from x1. Rotate ray −→
x1s around x1, both clockwise
and counterclockwise, until it hits the ﬁrst vertices on ∂PU and ∂PL. Let a1 be
the ﬁrst vertex on ∂PU and c1 the ﬁrst vertex on ∂PL. We next prove that
[s, x1] ⊂P s
(a1,x1,c1) and K[x1, t] ⊂P t
(a1,x1,c1).
From the construction of Sst
(a1,x1,c1), we know that [s, x1] ⊂P s
(a1,x1,c1) and
[s, s′] ⊂P s
(a1,x1,c1). Suppose K[x1, t] ̸⊂P t
(a1,x1,c1), which means at least part
of K[x1, t] is inside P s
(a1,x1,c1). We argue that at least one vertex of K[x1, t] is
inside P s
(a1,x1,c1). Suppose no vertex of K[x1, t] is inside P s
(a1,x1,c1) but a line
segment [xi, xi+1], i ∈[2..k], of K[x1, t] passes through P s
(a1,x1,c1). Since K is
a simple path, the only possible way that [xi, xi+1] passes through P s
(a1,x1,c1) is
that [xi, xi+1] crosses [s, s′] which contradicts Lemma 4.
Now suppose the ﬁrst vertex of K[x1, t] inside P s
(a1,x1,c1) is xi, for some i ∈
{2, 3, . . ., k}. From Lemma 4, we know that K can not cross [s, s′]. Then xi is
inside the simple polygon formed by [x1, s]∪[s, s′]∪∂PU[s′, a1]∪[a1, x1] (similar
if xi is inside the simple polygon formed by [x1, s] ∪[s, s′] ∪∂PL[s′, c1] ∪[c1, x1]).
There are two cases:
1. xi = x2. Since K is a 3-shortcut-free path, s can not see x2. Only ∂PU[s′, a1]
can block the view from s to x2. There is at least one vertex b ∈∂PU[s′, a1]

such that b is visible to x1. Then when we rotate the ray −→
x1s, it hits b before
a1. It contradicts the fact that a1 is the ﬁrst vertex of ∂PU that the ray −→
x1s
hits during rotation.
2. xi ̸= x2. There are two subcases:
(a) xi is visible to x1. Then [x1, xi] ∪K[x1, xi] forms a simple polygon.
According to Lemma 1, we know at least one vertex of x1, . . . , xi can
not form a pyramid with its neighboring vertices. This contradicts that
K is a simple 3-shortcut-free path.
(b) xi is not visible to x1. Only ∂PU[s′, a1] can block the view from x1 to
xi. There is at least one vertex b ∈∂PU[x1, xi] such that b is visible to
x1. Then, when we rotate the ray −→
x1s, it hits b before a1, contradicting
the fact that a1 is the ﬁrst vertex of ∂PU that the ray −→
x1s hits during
rotation.
We can ﬁnd all other st separators Sst
(ai,xi,ci)(i = 2, ..., k) as follows. Rotate
ray −−−−→
xixi−1 around xi, both clockwise and counterclockwise, until it hits the
ﬁrst vertices on ∂PU[ai−1, t′] and ∂PL[ci−1, t′]. Let ai be the ﬁrst vertex on
∂PU[ai−1, t′] and ci be the ﬁrst vertex on ∂PL[ci−1, t′]. Clearly, ai (resp., (ci))
must exist since only ∂PU[ai−1, t′] (resp., (∂PL[ci−1, t′])) can block the view
from xi to ai (resp., (ci)). Using a similar argument as above we can prove that
[xi−1, xi] ⊂P s
(ai,xi,ci) ∩P t
(ai−1,xi−1,ci−1) and K[xi, t] ⊂P t
(ai,xi,ci).
Since we can ﬁnd a sequence of st separators Sst
(ai,xi,ci) (i = 1, ..., k) such
that [s, x1] ⊂P s
(a1,x1,c1) ⊂P s
(a2,x2,c2)... ⊂P s
(ak,xk,ck) and [t, xk] ⊂P t
(ak,xk,ck) ⊂
P t
(ak−1,xk−1,ck−1)... ⊂P t
(a1,x1,c1), we have that K is an st oriented 3-shortcut-free
path. From the construction above, it follows that for each pyramid

xi−1xixi+1,
the exist three separators S(aj,xj,cj) (j = i−1, i, i+1) such that P s
(ai−1,xi−1,ci−1) ⊂
P s
(ai,xi,ci) ⊂P s
(ai+1,xi+1,ci+1) and P t
(ai+1,xi+1,ci+1) ⊂P t
(ap,xp,cp) ⊂P t
(ai−1,xi−1,ci−1),
and thus every pyramid on K is st oriented.

Lemma 6. For a shortest path −−−−→
SPxixj, if there exist two nonintersecting st sep-
arators Sst
(ai,xi,ci) and Sst
(aj,xj,cj) such that s ∈P s
(ai,xi,ci) and t ∈P t
(aj,xj,cj), then
−−−−→
SPxixj is st oriented.
Proof. First we prove that −−−−→
SPxixj ⊂P t
(ai,xi,ci) ∩P s
(aj,xj,cj). Suppose −−−−→
SPxixj
enters P s
(ai,xi,ci) by crossing [xi, ai]. [xi, ai] already intersects −−−−→
SPxixj at xi. This
contradicts the fact that a shortest path in P can not intersect a line segment in
P more than once. Similarly, we can argue that −−−−→
SPxixj can not enter P t
(aj,xj,cj).
Therefore −−−−→
SPxixj ⊂P t
(ai,xi,ci) ∩P s
(aj,xj,cj).
Let −−−−→
SPxixj = xif1f2...fkxj. We can ﬁnd all st separators Sst
(al,fl,cl)(l = 1, ..., k)
as follows: if fl ∈∂PL (similar if fl ∈∂PU), then let cl = fl and al be the ﬁrst
vertex on ∂PU[al−1, aj] (a0 = ai) which is visible to fl. Such al must exist since
only ∂PU[al−1, aj] can block the view from fl to al. Also −−−−→
SPflxj can not enter
P s
(al,fl,cl) since it already intersects the line segment [fl, al] at fl. So we ﬁnd all

st separators Sst
(al,fl,cl)(l = 1, ..., k) which separate −−−−→
SPflxj in a way that assures
−−−−→
SPxixj is st oriented.

Lemma 7. For two points xi and xj that cannot see each other in P, if there
exists an st oriented 3-shortcut-free path K = xixi+1 . . . xj , then −−−−→
SPxixj is st
oriented.
Proof. Since K is st oriented, there exists two disjoint st separators Sst
(ai,xi,ci) and
Sst
(aj,xj,cj) such that s ∈P s
(ai,xi,ci) and t ∈P t
(aj,xj,cj). According to Lemma 6,
−−−−→
SPxixj is st oriented.

For a pyramid

xk−2xk−1xk, there could be many possible simple st oriented 3-
shortcut-free paths from s to xk through

xk−2xk−1xk. For each such st oriented
3-shortcut-free path sx1x2...xk−2xk−1xk, all st separators Sst
(ai,xi,ci) (i = 1, ..., k)
are found as in Lemma 5. Then, either ak or ck is the last internal vertex of
−−−−−−→
SPxk−2xk.
Lemma 8. For any st oriented 3-shortcut-free path from s to xk such that the
last pyramid is

xk−2xk−1xk, ak or ck is decided only by the pyramid

xk−2xk−1xk.
Proof. Suppose

xk−2xk−1xk is a lower pyramid and the last internal vertex of
−−−−−−→
SPxk−2xk is f ∈∂PL. First we prove that the ray −−→
xkf intersects [xk−2, xk−1]
before it intersects another part of sx1x2...xk−2xk−1xk. Suppose −−→
xkf intersects
sx1x2...xk−2 ﬁrst at d and then intersects [xk−2, xk−1] at e, then d is between e
and xk on [e, xk] which is not the order they appear on sx1x2...xk−2xk−1xk. This
contradicts Lemma 2. Second, we prove that f is the ﬁrst vertex on ∂PL that is
visible to xk. Again, let e be the intersection point of ray −−→
xkf with [xk−2, xk−1].
Since −−−−−−→
SPxk−2xk is a convex chain, no point of ∂PL is in the triangle formed by
e, xk−1, xk. Therefore, f is the ﬁrst vertex on ∂PL[s, f] that is visible to xk.
Finally, we prove that [xk, f] does not intersect [xk−1, ck−1] which is the lower
part of Sst
(ak−1,xk−1,ck−1). Suppose [xk, f] intersects [xk−1, ck−1] at e. Then, ck−1
is after f on ∂PL. Since no part of sx1x2...xk−2 appears in the triangle formed
by f, xk−1 and xk, [xk−1, f] does not intersect any part of sx1x2...xk−2, which
means we can at least move ck−1 to f. From the argument above it follows ck
is f, which is the last internal vertex of −−−−−−→
SPxk−2xk, and is decided only by the
pyramid

xk−2xk−1xk.

The Algorithm
Our algorithm, MOD−SSSP, resembles a single source shortest path algorithm.
First, we construct the visibility graph G = (X, E), where E corresponds to pairs
of vertices (points in X) that can see each other in P. The edges are directed so
that between two visible points there are two corresponding edges in E. Second,
we construct another graph G′ = (V ′, E′) where each node v′ ∈V ′ corresponds
to an edge in E. Each edge e′ ∈E′ corresponds to an st oriented pyramid

xixjxk. So G′ has O(n2) vertices and O(n3) edges. G′ could be a cyclic graph.

From Lemma 7 it follows that if xi, xj cannot see each other in P, are on a cycle
in G′, and −−−−→
SPxixj is st oriented, then there is no st oriented 3-shortcut-free path
which starts at xj and ends at xi. Otherwise −−−−→
SPxjxi is also st oriented, which is
impossible since −−−−→
SPxixj is st oriented. Therefore, we can create another directed
acyclic graph G′′ = (X, E′′) such that e′′ = (xi, xj) ∈E′′ if −−−−→
SPxixj is st oriented.
After topological sort on G′′, we can assign a number SNxi to each node xi ∈X
according to that order. For each vertex v′ = [xi, xj] in G′, let the “value” of v′
be V alue[v′] = SNxj. Note that we can ignore vertices that appear before s in
the topological sort order.
We then perform a traversal of G′ in the order given by SN values. For each
vertex v′
ij = [xi, xj], we deﬁne the “distance” Dist(v′
ij) from s to v′
ij as follows:
initially, Dist(v′
ij) = Φ. If xi = s, rotate ray −→
xjs around xj, both clockwise and
counterclockwise, until it hits the ﬁrst vertices on ∂PU and ∂PL. Let aj be the
ﬁrst vertex on ∂PU and cj be the ﬁrst vertex on ∂PL. If the separator S(aj,xj,cj) is
an st separator, then Dist(v′
ij) = P s
(aj,xj,cj). Otherwise, we do not need to update
Dist(v′
ij). We deﬁne Dist(v′
ij) < Dist(v′
kl) if P s
(aj,xj,cj) ⊂P s
(al,xl,cl), Dist(v′
ij) >
Dist(v′
kl) if P s
(al,xl,cl) ⊂P s
(aj,xj,cj) and Dist(v′
ij) = Dist(v′
kl) if P s
(aj,xj,cj) ∩
P s
(al,xl,cl) ̸= Φ. If xi ̸= s and there exists a simple st oriented 3-shortcut-free
path sx1x2...xi with Dist(vi−1i) = P s
(ai,xi,ci) already computed, then rotate the
ray −−→
xjxi around xj, both clockwise and counterclockwise, until it hits the ﬁrst
vertices on ∂PU[ai, t′] and ∂PL[ci, t′]. Let aj be the ﬁrst vertex on ∂PU[ai, t′] and
cj be the ﬁrst vertex on ∂PL[ci, t′]. If the separator S(aj,xj,cj) is an st separator,
then Dist(v′
ij) = P s
(aj,xj,cj). Note that there are could be many st oriented paths
from s to xj. We need a list DistList(v′
ij) to record all possible distances from
s to v′
ij. Initially, DistList(v′
ij) is empty. When a new Dist(v′
ij) is computed,
if it is less than some distances in DistList(v′
ij), we add it into DistList(v′
ij)
and delete all distances greater than this new distance from DistList(v′
ij). If
it is greater than some distances in DistList(v′
ij), then do nothing. If it equals
all distances in DistList(v′
ij), then we add it into DistList(v′
ij). In this way,
all distances in DistList(v′
ij) are equal and all corresponding st separators are
arranged in an interleaved way (see Fig. 9). Assume xk precedes xi on the path
computed so far. To compute Dist(v′
ij), we select the distance from DistList(v′
ki)
such that Dist(v′
ij) is as close as possible to s′ (on ∂PU or ∂PL). How can we
achieve this? According to Lemma 8, if pyramid

xkxixj is a lower pyramid, then
cj is ﬁxed no matter which distance we selected from DistList(v′
ki). In order
to make aj as close to s′ as possible, we can select the separator S(al
i,xi,cl
i) such
that [xi, cl
i] is the closest one (when rotating the ray −−→
xixj towards s′) to [xi, xj]
and [xi, xj] ∈P t
(al
i,xi,cl
i). The distance selected from DistList(v′
ki) corresponds
to an edge e′
i =

xi−2xi−1xi in G′. We set the predecessor π[e′
j] = e′
i, where
e′
j =

xkxixj.
Theorem 1. The algorithm MOD−SSSP can ﬁnd O(n2) simple (s, X, t) paths
or report no such path exists in O(n3 log m + nm) time and O(n3 + m) space.

Fig. 9. Illustration of interleaved DistList(v′

Proof. Lemma 7 ensures that after a node v′ is selected for processing later
selections do not impact DistListv′. To see this, suppose a node v′ = [xi, xj]
is processed and later on a node w′ = [xk, xl] is selected. Since we traverse G′
in the order given by SN values, SNxj < SNxl which means −−−−→
SPxjxl is not st
oriented and there is no st oriented 3-shortcut-free path from xl to xj according
to Lemma 7. So DistListw′ does not impact DistListv′ since we never visit
v′ from w′. When the edge from v′ to some other vertex u′ is processed, the
appropriate “distance” selected from DistListv′ ensures that the extended edge
does not intersect at least one simple path that starts from s and ends at v′.
Furthermore, Distu′ is computed from DistListv′ such that no future candidate
edge originating at u′ is excluded.
For the running time,
1. We can compute the visibility graph of the points in X in O(m + n log n
log mn + n2) time and O(n + m) space [2]. The construction of G takes
O(n2) time.
2. From G, we compute G′ in O(n3) time; G′ has O(n2) nodes and O(n3) edges.
Each node v′ ∈G′ is assigned a value V alue(v′) according to the topological
sort order for G′′.
3. To construct G′′, we need decide whether the shortest path between any two
points of X is st oriented. We can construct the visibility graph of the points
of X to the vertices of P in O(nm) time [6]. This visibility graph consists
of n star shaped trees. The centers of those star trees are the points of X
and the other vertices in the star trees are vertices of P. For each point xi,
the vertices of P in the tree centered at xi are in clockwise order. Then,
all vertices on ∂PU are neighbors and all vertices on ∂PL are neighbors.
We can list those vertices in order: p1
iU, p2
iU, ..., pq
iU, pq+1
iL , pq+2
iL , ..., pk
iL, where
k = O(m). These lists, for all points in X, can be computed in O(nm) time.
From lemma 6, to decide whether −−−−→
SPxixj is st oriented, we only need to
ﬁnd two nonintersecting st separators Sst
(ai,xi,ci) and Sst
(aj,xj,cj) such that
s ∈P s
(ai,xi,ci) and t ∈P t
(aj,xj,cj). There are several subcases (See Fig. 10):

For xj, we can ﬁnd aj and cj in the same way. For one point of X, it takes
O(log m) time to ﬁnd an st separator if one exists or report no st separator
exists. For all n points of X, the total time is O(n log m). After that we can
decide whether −−−−→
SPxixj is st oriented in constant time. There are O(n2) pairs
of points of X. The total time for constructing G′′ is O(n2 + nm).
4. Traversal of G′ takes O(n3 log m), since
(a) Each node of G′ is visited O(n) times and each edge of G′ is visited once.
(b) The processing of an edge e′ = (u′, v′) ∈E′, where u′ = [xi, xj] and
v′ = [xj, xk], can be done in O(log m) time (ﬁnding the appropriate
“distance” in sorted DistListxixj takes O(log m) time and inserting the
newly created Distxjxk into sorted DistListxjxk takes O(log m) time
since |DistListxjxk| = O(m)).
Therefore, the total running time is O(n3 log m + nm). The space used by
MOD −SSSP is O(n3 + m) since for each edge in G′, it creates at most one
“distance” entry.
To report a simple path (if one exists), start from any pyramid e′ = 
xjxkt which
ends at t and trace back by using π[e′] and so on. In this way, we can ﬁnd O(n2)
simple paths from s to t since there can be O(n2) pyramids which end at t.

Abstract. In this paper we consider deﬂations (inverse pocket ﬂips) of
n-gons for small n. We show that every pentagon can be deﬂated after
ﬁnitely many deﬂations, and that any inﬁnite deﬂation sequence of a
pentagon results from deﬂating an induced quadrilateral on four of the
vertices. We describe a family of hexagons that deﬂate inﬁnitely for a spe-
ciﬁc deﬂation sequence, yet induce no inﬁnitely deﬂating quadrilateral.
We also review the known understanding of quadrilateral deﬂation.

Introduction
A deﬂation of a simple planar polygon is the operation of reﬂecting a subchain
of the polygon through the line connecting its endpoints such that (1) the line
intersects the polygon only at those two polygon vertices, (2) the resulting poly-
gon is simple (does not self-intersect), and (3) the reﬂected subchain lies inside
the hull of the resulting polygon. A polygon is deﬂated if it does not admit any
deﬂations, i.e., every pair of polygon vertices either deﬁnes a line intersecting
the polygon elsewhere or results in a nonsimple polygon after reﬂection.
Deﬂation is the inverse operation of pocket ﬂipping. Given a nonconvex simple
planar polygon, a pocket is a maximal connected region exterior to the polygon
and interior to its convex hull. Such a pocket is bounded by one edge of the
convex hull of the polygon, called the pocket lid, and a subchain of the polygon,
called the pocket subchain. A pocket ﬂip (or simply ﬂip) is the operation of
reﬂecting the pocket subchain through the line extending the pocket lid. The

Deﬂating the Pentagon

result is a new, simple polygon of larger area with the same edge lengths as the
original polygon. A convex polygon has no pocket and hence admits no ﬂip.
In 1935, Erd˝os conjectured that every nonconvex polygon convexiﬁes after a
ﬁnite number of ﬂips [5]. Four years later, Nagy [2] claimed a proof of Erd˝os’s
conjecture. Recently, Demaine et al. [3,4] uncovered a ﬂaw in Nagy’s argument,
as well as other claimed proofs, but fortunately correct proofs remain.
In the same spirit of ﬁnite ﬂips, Wegner conjectured in 1993 that any polygon
becomes deﬂated after a ﬁnite number of deﬂations [8]. Eight years later, Fevens
et al. [6] disproved Wegner’s conjecture by demonstrating a family of quadrilat-
erals that admit an inﬁnite number of deﬂations. They left an open problem of
characterizing which polygons deﬂate inﬁnitely. Ballinger [1] closed the problem
for quadrilaterals by proving that all inﬁnitely deﬂating simple quadrilaterals
are in the family deﬁned by Fevens et al. [6].
This paper attempts to advance the understanding of deﬂating n-gons be-
yond n = 4. We prove that every pentagon admitting an inﬁnite number of
deﬂations induces an inﬁnitely deﬂating quadrilateral on four of its vertices.
Then we show our main result: unlike quadrilaterals, every pentagon can be de-
ﬂated after ﬁnitely many (well-chosen) deﬂations. Finally, we construct a family
of inﬁnitely deﬂatable hexagons that induce no inﬁnitely deﬂating quadrilateral;
however, they deﬂate inﬁnitely only according to a speciﬁc deﬂation sequence.

Deﬁnitions and Notation
Let P = ⟨v0, v1, . . . , vn−1⟩be a polygon together with a clockwise ordering of
its vertices. Let P k = ⟨vk
0, vk
1, . . . , vk
n−1⟩denote the polygon after k arbitrary
deﬂations, and P ∗denote the limit of P k, when it exists, having vertices v∗
i .
Thus, the initial polygon P = P 0. The turn angle of a vertex vi is the signed
angle θ ∈(−180◦, 180◦] between the two vectors vi −vi−1 and vi −vi+1. A
vertex of a polygon is straight if the angle between its incident edges is 180◦,
i.e., forming a turn angle of 0◦. A ﬂat polygon is a polygon with all its vertices
collinear. A hairpin vertex vi is a vertex whose incident edges overlap each
other, i.e., forming a turn angle of 180◦.1 A polygon vertex is sharpened when
its absolute turn angle decreases.

Deﬂation in General
In this section, we prove general properties about deﬂation of arbitrary simple
polygons. Our ﬁrst few lemmata are fairly straightforward, while the last lemma
is quite intricate and central to our later arguments.
Lemma 1. Deﬂation only sharpens angles.
This result follows from an analogous result for pocket ﬂips, which only ﬂatten
angles (see, e.g., [7]). For completeness, we provide a proof.
1 This terminology was introduced in [4] where it plays a role in pocket ﬂips.

Proof. Consider the chain vi, vi+1, . . . , vj that is to be deﬂated across line ℓ
passing through vi and vj. The two vertices vi+1 and vi−1 are on diﬀerent sides
of ℓ. After deﬂating the chain vi, vi+1, . . . , vj, vi+1 is reﬂected across ℓand its
reﬂection is v′
i+1. Consider the two triangles vi−1vivi+1 and vi−1viv′
i+1. The
sides vivi+1 and viv′
i+1 have the same length (deﬂation preserves edge lengths).
Because vi+1 and v′
i+1 have the same distance from ℓ, and v′
i+1 is on the same
side of ℓas vi−1, then the length of vi−1v′
i+1 is less than the length of vi−1vi+1.
This implies that the angle opposite edge vi−1v′
i+1 is smaller than the angle
opposite edge vi−1vi+1 (by Euclid’s Propositions I.24 and I.25). Thus, the angle
at vertex vi sharpens.
2
Corollary 1. Any n-gon with no straight vertices will continue to have no
straight vertices after deﬂation, even in an accumulation point P ∗.
Lemma 2. In any inﬁnite deﬂation sequence P 0, P 1, P 2, . . ., the absolute turn
angle |τi| at any vertex vi has a (unique) limit |τ∗
i |.
Proof. By Lemma 1, |τi| never increases. Also, |τi| is bounded in the range
[0, 360◦). Hence, |τi| has a limit |τ ∗
i |.
2
Corollary 2. In any inﬁnite deﬂation sequence P 0, P 1, P 2, . . ., v∗
i is a hairpin
vertex in some accumulation point P ∗if and only if v∗
i is a hairpin vertex in all
accumulation points P ∗.
Lemma 3. Any n-gon with n odd and having no straight vertices cannot ﬂatten
in an accumulation point of an inﬁnite deﬂation sequence.
Proof. Suppose for contradiction that there is a ﬂat accumulation point. By
Lemma 1, this limit has no straight vertices, so all vertices must be hairpins.
Hence, the edges of the polygon alternate left and right. Because the edges form
a closed cycle, when the ﬁrst edge goes left, the last edge has to come back right
in order to close the cycle. Hence, the number of edges of a ﬂat polygon must be
even. Therefore, any polygon with an odd number of vertices cannot ﬂatten. 2
Lemma 4. For any inﬁnite deﬂation sequence P 0, P 1, P 2, . . ., there is a sub-
chain vi, vi+1, . . . , vj (where j −i ≥2) that is the pocket chain of inﬁnitely many
deﬂations.
Proof. Label each time t with (i, j) if the t-th deﬂation has pocket chain vi, vi+1,
. . . , vj (with j −i ≥2). There are only ﬁnitely many labels, but inﬁnitely many
deﬂations, so some label must appear inﬁnitely often. This label (i, j) corre-
sponds to the desired subchain vi, vi+1, . . . , vj.
2
We conclude this section with a challenging lemma showing that inﬁnitely de-
ﬂating pockets ﬂatten:
Lemma 5. Assume P = P 0 has no straight vertices. If P ∗is an accumulation
point of the inﬁnite deﬂation sequence P 0, P 1, P 2, . . ., and subchain vi, vi+1, . . . ,
vj (where j −i ≥2) is the pocket chain of inﬁnitely many deﬂations, then

v∗

i+1, . . . , v∗
j are collinear and v∗
i+1, . . . , v∗
j−1 are hairpin vertices. Further-
more, if v∗

j−1 extends beyond v∗
j , then v∗
j is a hairpin vertex; and if
v∗
i+1, . . . , v∗
j−1 extends beyond v∗
i , then v∗
i is a hairpin vertex. In particular, if
j −i = 2, then either v∗
i or v∗
j is a hairpin vertex.
Proof. Because P 0 ⊇P 1 ⊇P 2 ⊇· · ·, we have hull(P 0) ⊇hull(P 1) ⊇hull(P 2) ⊇
· · ·, and in particular area(hull(P 0)) ≥area(hull(P 1)) ≥area(hull(P 2)) ≥· · ·
≥
0. Thus, ∞
t=1[area(hull(P t)) −area(hull(P t−1))] ≤area(hull(P 0)), so
area(hull(P t)) −area(hull(P t−1)) →0 as t →∞. Hence, for any ϵ > 0, there
is a time Tϵ such that, for all t ≥Tϵ, area(hull(P t)) −area(hull(P t−1)) ≤ϵ. As
a consequence, for all t ≥Tϵ, hull(P t−1) ⊆hull(P t) ⊕Dϵ/ℓwhere ⊕denotes
Minkowski sum, Dx denotes a disk of radius x, and ℓis the length of the longest
edge in P, which is a lower bound on the perimeter of hull(P t).
Let t1, t2, . . . denote the inﬁnite subsequence of deﬂations that use vi, vi+1, . . . ,
vj as the pocket subchain, where P tr is the polygon immediately after the rth
deﬂation of the pocket chain vi, vi+1, . . . , vj. Consider any vertex vk with i <
k < j. If tr ≥Tϵ, then vtr−1
k
∈hull(P tr) ⊕Dϵ/ℓ. Also, vtr−1
k
is in the halfplane
Hr exterior to the line of support of P tr through vtr
i
and vtr
j . Now, the region
(hull(P tr) ⊕Dϵ/ℓ) ∩Hr converges to a subset of the line ℓtr
i,j through vtr
i
and
vtr
j
as ϵ →0 while keeping tr ≥Tϵ. Thus, for any accumulation point P ∗, v∗
k is
collinear with v∗
i and v∗
j , for all i < k < j. In other words, v∗
i+1, . . . , v∗
j−1 lie on
the line ℓ∗
i,j through v∗
i and v∗
j . By Corollary 1, v∗
i+1, . . . , v∗
j−1 are not straight,
so they must be hairpins.
By Lemma 2, the absolute turn angle |τj| of vertex vj has a limit |τ ∗
j |. If
|τ∗
j | > 0 (i.e., v∗
j is not a hairpin in all limit points P ∗), then by Lemma 1,
|τt
j| ≥|τ ∗
j | > 0. For suﬃciently large t, vt
j−1 approaches the line ℓt
i,j. To form
the absolute turn angle |τt
j| ≥|τ ∗
j | > 0 at vj, vt
j+1 must eventually be bounded
away from the line ℓt
i,j: after some time T , the minimum of the two angles
between vt
jvt
j+1 and ℓt
i,j must be bounded below by some α > 0. Now suppose
that some vtr−1
k
were to extend beyond vtr−1
j
in the projection onto the line
ℓtr−1
i,j
for some tr −1 > T . As illustrated in Figure 1, for the deﬂation of the
chain vtr−1
i
, vtr−1
i+1 , . . . , vtr−1
j
to not cause the next polygon P tr to self-intersect,
the minimum of the two angles between vtr−1
j
vtr−1
k
and ℓtr−1
i,j
must also be at
least α.
But this is impossible for suﬃciently large t, because vt
k accumulates on the
line ℓt
i,j. Hence, in fact, vt
k must not extend beyond vt
j in the ℓt
i,j projection for
suﬃciently large t. In other words, when v∗
j is not a hairpin, each v∗
k must not
extend beyond v∗
j on the line ℓ∗
i,j. A symmetric argument handles the case when
v∗
i is not a hairpin.
Finally, suppose that j −i = 2. In this case, because v∗
i+1 = v∗
j−1 is a hairpin,
it must extend beyond one of its neighbors, v∗
i or v∗
j . By the argument above, in
the ﬁrst case, v∗
i must be a hairpin, and in the second case, v∗
j must be a hairpin.
Thus, as desired, either v∗
i or v∗
j must be a hairpin.

Deﬂating Quadrilaterals
We brieﬂy review facts about quadrilateral deﬂation proved by Fevens et al. [6]
and Ballinger [1]. For completeness, we also show how to prove these results
using, in particular, our new Lemma 5.
Lemma 6. [1] Any accumulation point of an inﬁnite deﬂation sequence of a
quadrilateral is ﬂat and has no straight vertices.
Proof. First we argue that all quadrilaterals P 1, P 2, . . . (excluding the initial
quadrilateral P 0) have no straight vertices. Because deﬂations are the inverse of
pocket ﬂips, and pocket ﬂips do not exist for convex polygons, deﬂation always
results in a nonconvex polygon. Thus all quadrilaterals P t with t > 0 must be
nonconvex. Hence no P t with t > 0 can have a straight vertex, because then it
would lie along an edge of the triangle of the other three vertices, making the
quadrilateral convex. By Corollary 1, there are also no straight vertices in any
accumulation point P ∗.
By Lemma 4, there is a subchain vi, vi+1, . . . , vj, where j −i ≥2, that is the
pocket chain of inﬁnitely many deﬂations. In fact, j −i must equal 2, because
reﬂecting a longer (4-vertex) pocket chain would not change the polygon. Ap-
plying Lemma 5 to P 1, P 2, . . . (where there are no straight vertices), for any
accumulation point P ∗, v∗
i+1 is a hairpin and either v∗
i or v∗
j = v∗
i+2 is a hairpin.
Hairpin v∗
i+1 implies that v∗
i , v∗
i+1, v∗
i+2 are collinear, while hairpin v∗
i or v∗
i+2
implies that the remaining vertex v∗
i+3 = v∗
i−1 lie on that same line. Therefore,
any accumulation point P ∗is ﬂat.

Theorem 1. [6,1] A simple quadrilateral with side lengths ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ3, ℓ4 is in-
ﬁnitely deﬂatable if and only if
1. opposite edges sum equally, i.e., ℓ1 + ℓ3 = ℓ2 + ℓ4; and
2. adjacent edges diﬀer, i.e., ℓ1 ̸= ℓ2, ℓ2 ̸= ℓ3, ℓ3 ̸= ℓ4, ℓ4 ̸= ℓ1.

Deﬂating the Pentagon
61
Furthermore, every such inﬁnitely deﬂatable quadrilateral deﬂates inﬁnitely in-
dependent of the choice of deﬂation sequence.
Proof. Fevens et al. [6] proved that every quadrilateral satisfying the two con-
ditions on its edge lengths is inﬁnitely deﬂatable, no matter which deﬂation
sequence we make. Thus the two conditions are suﬃcient for inﬁnite deﬂation.
To see that the ﬁrst condition is necessary, we use Lemma 6. Because deﬂa-
tion preserves edge lengths, so do accumulation points of an inﬁnite deﬂation
sequence, so the ﬂat limit conﬁguration from Lemma 6 is a ﬂat conﬁguration of
the edge lengths ℓ1, ℓ2, ℓ3, ℓ4. By a suitable rotation, we may arrange that the
ﬂat conﬁguration lies along the x axis. By Lemma 6, no vertex is straight, so ev-
ery vertex must be a hairpin. Thus, during a traversal of the polygon boundary,
the edges alternate between going left ℓi and going right ℓi. At the end of the
traversal, we must end up where we started. Therefore, ±(ℓ1 −ℓ2 + ℓ3 −ℓ4) = 0,
i.e., ℓ1 + ℓ3 = ℓ2 + ℓ4.
To see that the second condition is necessary, suppose for contradiction that
ℓ1 = ℓ2 (the other contrary cases are symmetric). By the ﬁrst condition, ℓ1+ℓ3 =
ℓ2 + ℓ4, so ℓ3 = ℓ4. Thus, the polygon is a kite, having two pairs of adjacent
equal sides. (Also, all four sides might be equal.) Every kite has a chord that
is a line of reﬂectional symmetry. No kite can deﬂate along this line, because
such a deﬂation would cause edges to overlap with their reﬂections. If a kite is
convex, it may deﬂate along its other chord, but then it becomes nonconvex, so
it can be deﬂated only along its line of reﬂectional symmetry. Therefore, a kite
can be deﬂated at most once, so any inﬁnitely deﬂatable quadrilateral must have
ℓ1 ̸= ℓ2 and symmetrically ℓ1 ̸= ℓ2, ℓ2 ̸= ℓ3, ℓ3 ̸= ℓ4, and ℓ4 ̸= ℓ1.

Deﬂating Pentagons
First we observe that the pentagon problem is relatively simple if we allow a
straight vertex: we can subdivide the long edge of an inﬁnitely deﬂating quadri-
lateral.
Theorem 2. There is a simple pentagon with a straight vertex that deﬂates
inﬁnitely for all deﬂation sequences, exactly like the quadrilateral on the nonﬂat
vertices.
Proof. See Figure 2. We start with an inﬁnitely deﬂating quadrilateral ⟨v0, v1, v2,
v3⟩according to Theorem 1, and add a straight vertex v4 along the edge v3v0.
As long as we never deﬂate along a line passing through the straight vertex v4,
the deﬂations act exactly like the quadrilateral, and thus continue inﬁnitely no
matter which deﬂation sequence we choose. To achieve this property, we set
the length of segment v3v0 to 1, with v4 at the midpoint; we set the lengths of
edges v0v1 and v2v3 to 2/3; and we set the length of edge v1v2 to 1/3. Then we
deﬂate the quadrilateral until the vertices are so close to being hairpins that v4
cannot see the nonadjacent convex vertex and the line through v4 and the reﬂex
vertex intersects the pentagon at another point. Thus no line of deﬂation passes
through v4, so we maintain inﬁnite deﬂation as in the induced quadrilateral. 2

Fig. 2. An inﬁnitely deﬂatable pentagon that induces an inﬁnitely deﬂatable quadri-
lateral (left) and its conﬁguration after the ﬁrst deﬂation (right)
Finally we show that any inﬁnitely deﬂating pentagon induces an inﬁnitely de-
ﬂating quadrilateral.
Theorem 3. Every simple pentagon with no straight vertices can be deﬂated by
a ﬁnite sequence of (well-chosen) deﬂations. Furthermore, any inﬁnite deﬂation
sequence in such a pentagon induces an inﬁnitely deﬂating quadrilateral.
Proof. Let P be a pentagon with no straight vertices, and assume for the sake of
contradiction that P deﬂates inﬁnitely. Consider any accumulation point P ∗of
an inﬁnite deﬂation sequence P 0, P 1, P 2, . . .. By Lemma 4, there is an inﬁnitely
deﬂating pocket chain, say v0, v1, . . . , vj, where j ≥2. By Lemma 5, v∗
1, . . . , v∗
j−1
are hairpin vertices. Because the pentagon has only ﬁve vertices, j ≤4. In fact,
j ≤3: if j = 4, this pocket chain would encompass all ﬁve vertices, making P ∗
collinear, which contradicts Lemma 3. If j = 3, then v∗
1 and v∗
2 are hairpins. If
j = 2, then by Lemma 5, either v∗
0 or v∗
2 must be a hairpin; assume by symmetry
that it is v∗
2. Thus, in this case, again v∗
1 and v∗
2 are hairpins. Hence, in all cases,
v∗
1 and v∗
2 are hairpins, so v∗
0, v∗
1, v∗
2, v∗
3 are collinear, while by Lemma 3 the ﬁfth
vertex v∗
4 must be oﬀthis line. In particular, v∗
0, v∗
3, and v∗
4 are not hairpins.

duced inﬁnitely deﬂating quadri-
lateral, which is inﬁnitely deﬂat-

v0, v1, v2, v3
By Lemma 5, any inﬁnitely deﬂating chain
is ﬂat in the accumulation point P ∗, so the
only possible inﬁnitely deﬂating chains are
v0, v1, v2; v1, v2, v3; and v0, v1, v2, v3 (Fig-
ure 3). Let T denote the time after which
only these three chains deﬂate. Thus, after
time T , v0, v3, and v4 stop moving, so in
particular, v4’s angle and the length of the
edge v0v3 take on their ﬁnal values. There-
fore, after time T , the vertices v0, v1, v2, v3
induce a quadrilateral that deﬂates inﬁnitely,
except that the chain v0, v1, v2, v3 might de-
ﬂate. However, if at some time t > T the
chain vt
0, vt
1, vt
2, vt
3 deﬂates along the line through vt
0 and vt
3 into the triangle
vt

0
vt+1

, which is ﬁxed, so no fur-
ther deﬂations are possible, resulting in a ﬁnite deﬂation sequence. Therefore
the inﬁnite deﬂation sequence can deﬂate only the chains v0, v1, v2 and v1, v2, v3
after time T . Indeed, after time T the sequence must alternate between deﬂating
these two chains, because no chain can deﬂate twice in a row.

Deﬂating the Pentagon
63
We claim that v∗
1 and v∗
2 lie along the segment v∗
0v∗
3. Because v∗
1 and v∗
2 are
hairpins, the only other possibilities are that v∗
1 extends beyond v∗
3 or that v∗
2
extends beyond v∗
0. If v∗
1 extended beyond v∗
3, then applying Lemma 5 to v1, v2, v3
would imply that v∗
3 is a hairpin, which is a contradiction. Therefore, v∗
1 must
lie along the segment v∗
0v∗
3, and similarly v∗
2 must lie along the segment v∗
0v∗
3.
By Theorem 1, no two adjacent edges of the quadrilateral have the same length,
so in fact v∗
1 and v∗
2 must be strictly interior to the segment v∗
0v∗
3. Hence, for
suﬃciently large t > T , vt
0, vt
1, vt
2, vt
3 are arbitrarily close to collinear with vt
1
and vt
2 projecting to the relative interior of segment vt
0vt
3. Also, vt
1 and vt
2 must
be outside the triangle vt
0vt
3vt
4 because the quadrilateral v0, v1, v2, v3 remains
deﬂatable. As a consequence, for suﬃciently large t > T , we can deﬂate the
chain vt
0, vt
1, vt
2, vt
3, which prevents all further deﬂations as argued above. Thus
we obtain an alternate, ﬁnite deﬂation sequence.
⊓⊔

Larger Polygons and Well-Chosen Deﬂations
It is easy to construct n-gons with n ≥6 that deﬂate inﬁnitely, no matter which
deﬂation sequence we choose. See Figure 4(a) for the idea of the construction. We
can add any number of spikes to an inﬁnitely deﬂating quadrilateral to obtain
n-gons with n ≥6 and even. For n ≥7 and odd, we can shave oﬀthe tip of
one of the spikes. Thus, n = 5 is the only value for which every n-gon with no
straight vertices can be ﬁnitely deﬂated.
None of the inﬁnitely deﬂating polygons of Figure 4 are particularly satisfying
because their accumulation points are not ﬂat. Are there any n-gons, n > 4, that
have no straight vertices and always deﬂate inﬁnitely to ﬂat accumulation points?
If we require that the n-gon is inﬁnitely deﬂatable to a ﬂat accumulation point
only for at least one deﬂation sequence, then we can construct such a hexagon
by taking two inﬁnitely deﬂating quadrilaterals v0, v1, v2, v3 and v3, v4, v5, v0

deﬂating quadrilateral
(with their longest edge having the same length) and joining them along their
longest edge; removing this edge will leave us with hexagon v0, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5.
See Figure 5. This hexagon will deﬂate inﬁnitely if we deﬂate only the two
subchains v0, v1, v2, v3 and v3, v4, v5, v0 independently, and never deﬂate across
the line through v0 and v3. This hexagon has an inﬁnitely deﬂating quadrilateral
as a subpolygon, and indeed its inﬁnite deﬂation sequences are interleavings of
the two such quadrilaterals.
Next we present a family of hexagons that deﬂate inﬁnitely to a ﬂat accumu-
lation point for some deﬂation sequence but do not induce an inﬁnitely deﬂating
quadrilateral. Figure 6 shows an example.
Theorem 4. A simple hexagon H = ⟨v0, v1, v2, v3, v4, v5⟩with side lengths ℓi =
|vi−1vi| (where v6 = v0) has an inﬁnite deﬂation sequence with ﬂat accumulation
points if it satisﬁes the following ﬁve properties:
1. opposite edges sum equally, i.e., ℓ1 + ℓ3 + ℓ5 = ℓ2 + ℓ4 + ℓ6;
2. adjacent edges diﬀer, i.e., ℓ1 ̸= ℓ2, ℓ2 ̸= ℓ3, ℓ3 ̸= ℓ4, ℓ4 ̸= ℓ5, ℓ5 ̸= ℓ6, ℓ6 ̸= ℓ1;
3.
1
2ℓ1 < ℓ2 < ℓ1;
4. ℓ6 > 3ℓ1; and
5. the hexagon is symmetric about the perpendicular bisector of the edge v0v5.
(In particular, ℓ1 = ℓ5 and ℓ2 = ℓ4, and v0v5 is parallel to v2v3.)
Proof. Consider a hexagon H satisfying the ﬁve properties. Assume by suitable
rotation and reﬂection that v0v5 (and hence v2v3) is horizontal, v0 is left of v5,
and v2 (and hence v3) is above the horizontal line through v0 and v5.

Fig. 7. The two possible conﬁgurations of H if it self-intersects
We argue that any such hexagon H is simple. Obviously, the parallel edges
v2v3 and v0v5 do not cross. If v0v1 (and hence v4v5) intersects v2v3, as in Fig-
ure 7(a), then by the planar quadrilateral uncrossing lemma, ℓ1+ℓ3 > ℓ2 +|v0v3|
and ℓ5 +|v0v3| > ℓ4 +ℓ6, which sum to ℓ1 +ℓ3 +ℓ5 +|v0v3| > ℓ2 +ℓ4 +ℓ6 +|v0v3|,
contradicting Property 1. Similarly, if v1v2 (and hence v3v4) intersects v0v5, as
in Figure 7(b) or its reﬂection, then ℓ2 +ℓ6 > ℓ1+|v2v5| and ℓ4+|v2v5| > ℓ3+ℓ5,
which sum to ℓ2+ℓ4+ℓ6+|v2v5| > ℓ1+ℓ3+ℓ5+|v2v5|, contradicting Property 1.
In projection onto the horizontal line through v0v5, v1 can reach at most ℓ1 to the
right of v0 and v4 can reach at most ℓ5 = ℓ1 to the left of v5. By Property 4, this
travel is small enough that v1 must be left of v4. Thus, in particular, v0v1 cannot
cross v4v5. If v2 were right of v3, then |v0v2|+|v3v5| > ℓ3 +ℓ6, so by the triangle
inequality, ℓ1+ℓ2 +ℓ4+ℓ5 > ℓ3+ℓ6, so by Property 4, ℓ1 +ℓ2+ℓ4+ℓ5 > ℓ3+3ℓ1,
i.e., ℓ2 +ℓ4 > ℓ3 +ℓ1, so by Property 1, ℓ6 < ℓ5, contradicting Property 4. Hence,
v2 is left of v3. Thus v0, v1, and v2 are left of v3, v4, and v5, so v0v1 and v1v2
cannot cross v3v4 or v4v5. Hence no pairs of edges can cross. Property 2, together
with Properties 1 and 5, forbids edges from overlapping and forbids nonadjacent
edges from touching. Therefore H must be simple.
Next we claim that v1 (and hence v4), like v2 and v3, is above the horizontal
line through v0v5, implying that v0 (and hence v5) is convex. Because ℓ1 = ℓ5
and ℓ2 = ℓ4, Property 1 can be rewritten as 2ℓ1 + ℓ3 = 2ℓ2 + ℓ6. By Property 3,
ℓ2 < ℓ1, so ℓ3 < ℓ6. Thus v2 is above and to the right of v0. Because ℓ2 < ℓ1,
if v1 were not also above v0, the edge v1v2 could not reach a point above and
to the right of v0 without crossing v0v5. But we showed that H is simple, so v1
must in fact be above v0.
Now we claim that the hexagon H deﬂates inﬁnitely by repeating the following
three-step sequence ad inﬁnitum: ﬁrst deﬂate across the line passing through v0
and v2, second across the line through v3 and v5, and third across the line through
v2 and v3. Exactly where we begin this inﬁnite sequence depends on the initial
hexagon H: if v2 (and hence v3) is reﬂex, we start on the ﬁrst step; otherwise,
we start on the third step. In general, the ﬁrst step will be executed when v2
(and v3) is reﬂex, the second step will be executed when just v3 is reﬂex, and
the third step will be executed when v2 and v3 are convex. We also maintain
the invariant that the hexagon is symmetric about the perpendicular bisector of
v0v5 (Property 5) after every execution of the second and third steps. We need
to show that (1) no deﬂation step introduces crossings, and (2) every line of
deﬂation intersects the hexagon only at the two vertices deﬁning it.

E.D. Demaine et al.
We have already shown that the hexagon is simple after any execution of the
second or third step, because then the hexagon satisﬁes Property 5. We can argue
simplicity after the execution of the ﬁrst step by comparing with the hexagon
that was just before the ﬁrst step and with the hexagon that will be just after
the next second step. Therefore the hexagon is simple at all stages.
It remains to show that every line of deﬂation hits the hexagon boundary just
at its two deﬁning vertices. The argument for the ﬁrst step, deﬂating across v0v2,
is below. The argument for the second step is similar to simplicity: Properties 3
and 4 guarantee that v1 is always left of v3, and in this case v1 is below the
horizontal line through v3, while v0 is below and right of v3, so the line through
v3 and v5 cannot hit v0v1 or v1v2. The argument for the third step is easy: the
line through v1 and v4 cannot hit any of the incident edges (v0v1, v1v2, v3v4,
and v4v5), and by Property 5 the line is horizontal, so it cannot hit the two
remaining horizontal edges (v2v3 and v0v5).
Finally we consider deﬂating across v0v2, where it suﬃces to prove that v4
is to the right of the line from v0 to v2. Assume by suitable translation that
vertex v0 is at the origin, and let θ be the interior angle at v0. Then v1 has
coordinates ⟨ℓ1 cos θ, ℓ1 sin θ⟩and v4 = ⟨ℓ6 −ℓ1 cos θ, ℓ1 sin θ⟩. The x coordinate
of v2 is 1
2ℓ6 −1
2ℓ3, which by adding half of Property 1 is ℓ1 −ℓ2. Now consider
the right triangle v1v2x, where x is the point below v1 and horizontal with v2.
The hypotenuse is ℓ2, and the horizontal edge has length (ℓ1 −ℓ2) −ℓ1 cos θ =
ℓ1(1 −cos θ) −ℓ2, so the vertical edge has length

ℓ2
2 −(ℓ1(1 −cos θ) −ℓ2)2.
Thus, v2 = ⟨ℓ1 −ℓ2, ℓ1 sin θ −

ℓ2
2 −(ℓ1(1 −cos θ) −ℓ2)2⟩. Note that, for v2 to
have a valid (noncomplex) solution, we must have 2ℓ2 > ℓ1, which is part of
Property 3.
Now, v4 is to the right of the line from v0 to v2 if and only if the signed area
of the triangle v0v2v4 is negative. Thus we desire the following inequality:
x1 y1 1
x3 y3 1
x5 y5 1
=
0
0
1
ℓ1 −ℓ2
ℓ1 sin θ −

ℓ2
2 −(ℓ1(1 −cos θ) −ℓ2)2 1
ℓ6 −ℓ1 cos θ
ℓ1 sin θ
1
< 0.
After signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation, this inequality becomes
ℓ1(cos θ−1)(ℓ1−ℓ2)[ℓ2
1(1+3 cosθ+4 cos2 θ)−ℓ6ℓ1(2+6 cosθ)+2ℓ2
6−ℓ1ℓ2(1+cos θ)]<0.
Because θ is between 0 and π, and ℓ2 < ℓ1, this inequality is equivalent to
ℓ2
1(1 + 3 cosθ + 4 cos2 θ) −ℓ6ℓ1(2 + 6 cos θ) + 2ℓ2
6 −ℓ1ℓ2(1 + cos θ) > 0.
Also, because ℓ2 < ℓ1, it is enough to show
ℓ2
1(2 cos θ + 4 cos2 θ) −ℓ6ℓ1(2 + 6 cos θ) + 2ℓ2
6 > 0.
If ℓ6 = αℓ1, then the inequality becomes
(cos θ + 2 cos2 θ) −α(1 + 3 cosθ) + α2 > 0.

Deﬂating the Pentagon
67
The maximum lower bound on α that satisﬁes this inequality occurs at θ = 0;
in this case, we obtain 3 −4α + α2 = 0, which has solution α = 3. Therefore,
Condition 4 that ℓ6 > 3ℓ1 suﬃces.
We can easily show that every accumulation point of our deﬂation sequence
is ﬂat: because each of the chains v0, v1, v2; v3, v4, v5; and v1, v2, v3, v4 deﬂate
inﬁnitely, then by Lemma 5, in every accumulation point, the vertices of each of
the chains are collinear, forcing all six vertices to be collinear.

Open Problems
It remains open whether there exist n-gons, n ≥6, that have no straight vertices
and deﬂate inﬁnitely for every deﬂation sequence to ﬂat accumulation points.
Also, does every inﬁnite deﬂation sequence have a (unique) limit? Our proofs
would likely simplify if we knew there were only one accumulation point.
Is there an eﬃcient algorithm to determine whether a given polygon P has an
inﬁnite deﬂation sequence? What about detecting whether all deﬂation sequences
are inﬁnite? Even given a (succinctly encoded) inﬁnite sequence of deﬂations,
can we eﬃciently determine whether the sequence is valid?

Abstract. We describe computer algorithms that can enumerate and
display, for a given n > 0 (in theory, of any size), all n-ominoes, n-
iamonds, and n-hexes that can tile the plane using only rotations; these
sets necessarily contain all such tiles that are fundamental domains for
p4, p3, and p6 isohedral tilings. We display the outputs for small values
of n. This expands on earlier work [3].

Polyominoes, Polyiamonds, Polyhexes and Isohedral
Tilings
Polyominoes, polyiamonds and polyhexes are among the simplest shapes for tiles
and are easily produced by computer or by hand. A polyomino (or n-omino) is a
planar tile made up of n congruent squares joined at their edges. A polyiamond
(or n-iamond) is a planar tile made up of n congruent equilateral triangles joined
at their edges. A polyhex (or n-hex) is a planar tile made up of n congruent
regular hexagons joined at their edges.
There is a rich store of problems concerning these tiles. Most of the problems
about these tiles are about their tiling properties. In this work, we focus on
isohedral tilings of the plane by these tiles in which the tilings have 3-, 4-, or
6-fold rotational symmetry. An isohedral tiling of the plane is one in which
congruent copies of a single tile ﬁll the plane without gaps or overlaps, and the
symmetry group of the tiling acts transitively on the tiles. In our discussion, we
assume knowledge of the lattice of rotation centers of the symmetry groups p3,
p4, and p6 [1,2].

Enumeration of Polyominoes, Polyiamonds and Polyhexes
69
In our previous article [3], we discussed a method to generate polyominoes
that can tile the plane using only 90◦rotations with centers on the boundaries
of the tiles, and consequently we could enumerate, for a given n, all n-ominoes
that are fundamental domains for p4 isohedral tilings, that is, minimal regions
which, when acted on by the symmetry group of the tiling, generate the whole
tiling. In this work, we present a new algorithm for polyominoes and extend it
to polyiamonds and polyhexes that can tile the plane using only 120◦rotations,
and to polyiamonds that can tile the plane using 60◦and 120◦rotations. As a
result, we shall enumerate, for small values of n, all n-ominoes, n-iamonds and
n-hexes that are fundamental domains for p4, p3 or p6 isohedral tilings. We
use a shortened terminology for the tiles produced by our algorithms, and call
them p4 polyominoes, p3 polyiamonds and polyhexes, and p6 polyiamonds.
2
p4 Polyominoes
In our previous article [3], we introduced a line segment to represent a unit
shape as shown in Fig. 1 (a)–(c) for p4 polyominoes, p3 polyiamonds, and p6
polyiamonds, respectively. For p4 polyominoes, the square is a unit shape (that
is, every n-omino is a union of such congruent shapes) and so we could enumerate
all polyominoes that are fundamental domains for p4 isohedral tilings. On the
other hand, for p3 or p6 polyiamonds, the diamonds are not unit shapes since
unions of these can only produce n-iamonds for n even. This is a main reason
why we could not enumerate all polyiamonds that are fundamental domains for
p3 or p6 isohedral tilings.
In our new algorithm, instead of using a line segment to represent a unit
shape, we use the unit shape itself to generate polyominoes, polyiamonds and
polyhexes, i.e., a unit square, unit equilateral triangle, and unit regular hexagon,
respectively.
We ﬁrst consider the p4 polyominoes. Underlying every edge-to-edge tiling
of the plane by congruent n-ominoes is a lattice of the unit squares that make
up each n-omino tile (Fig. 2). If the tiling is isohedral and has p4 symmetry,
then two 4-fold rotations acting on one tile can generate the whole tiling. If the
n-omino tile is a fundamental domain for the tiling, then necessarily the centers
of these 4-fold rotations are on the boundary of the tile [4] and hence they must
lie on lattice points of the square lattice underlying the tiling.
To produce polyominoes that can tile the plane isohedrally by 4-fold rotations,
we begin with a lattice of unit squares and place the ﬁrst 4-fold center at a lattice

point (the black circle in Fig. 2) and call this center the origin. Next, we choose
a second lattice point to be the other 4-fold center (the white circle in Fig. 2);
this can be written as xu + yv, where u and v are the horizontal and vertical
unit vectors of the lattice shown in Fig. 2, respectively, and x, y = 0, 1, 2, . . .. We
call this second center the terminus.
Successive rotations about these two 4-fold centers will generate the p4 sym-
metry group. Moreover, the area of a fundamental domain for an isohedral tiling
with this symmetry group is
S = x2 + y2

square units. Note that to produce an n-omino that is a fundamental domain,
we must have n = S and S must be an integer, i.e.,
n = 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16, 17, 18, 20, . . .
The p4 symmetry group generated by the two designated centers acts on all the
unit squares in the lattice, partitioning them into n equivalence classes (orbits).
Thus we can construct p4 n-ominoes having area S by the following procedure,
in which the unit shape is a unit square in the square lattice.
Procedure
1. Choose the ﬁrst unit shape to have one vertex at the origin.
2. Choose a new unit shape so that it has an edge in common with at least one
of the unit shapes already chosen, and so that the new unit shape belongs
to an equivalence class diﬀerent from all equivalence classes of unit shapes
already chosen.
3. Repeat 2 until n unit shapes are chosen and one of the unit shapes has a
vertex at the terminus.
4. Record the tile produced and continue 1–3 recursively, not allowing the same
sequence of choices in 1–3 that produced any previously recorded tiles.
5. Eliminate equivalent tiles which yield the same tiling pattern. Here two tiles
are equivalent if and only if they are congruent, with their rotation centers in
the same positions on their boundaries. (It is necessary to permute the three
types of centers (black, white, and gray) in order to compare the positions
of rotation centers on two congruent tiles.)

Fig. 4. An isohedral p4 tiling with an 8-omino as fundamental domain
Fig. 3, reproduced from Fig. 4 in reference [3], is the result of the above proce-
dure. The ﬁrst number in the 2-number label identiﬁes n and the second number
identiﬁes the number of the tile for that n. For example, 8-17 identiﬁes the 17th
8-omino listed by the computer. If the same polyomino can have diﬀerent 4-fold
rotation centers, a third number is added after the 2-number label. For example,
5-1 and 5-1-2 are the same polyomino but have diﬀerently-placed rotation centers.
For each tile, its corresponding p4 tiling is obtained by using the black and
white circles as 4-fold rotation centers. For example, tile 8-22 produces the tiling
shown in Fig. 4. For n > 8 we obtain 80(82) p4 9-ominoes and 277(300) p4 10-
ominoes, where the numbers in parentheses denote the number of polyominoes
when those with diﬀerently-placed rotation centers are distinguished in counting.

H. Fukuda et al.
When the tiling generated by rotations about the black and white centers
marked on a tile has as its symmetry group the group generated by these ro-
tations, the tile is a usually a fundamental domain for that tiling. When the
tiling has a larger symmetry group, or the tile has symmetry, often only a frac-
tion of the tile will be a fundamental domain. Our earlier article [3] gives some
examples of tiles that are not fundamental domains for the tiling generated by
rotations about the two centers on their boundaries, and other examples are
given in section 5 of this article. However, the set of all tiles that are generated
by our algorithm will contain all those that are fundamental domains for the
tilings they generate.
3
p3 and p6 Polyiamonds
The algorithm introduced in the previous section is also applicable to polyia-
monds and polyhexes. In this section, we consider p3 and p6 polyiamonds.
Any edge-to-edge tiling of the plane by congruent n-iamonds will have an
underlying regular tiling by the unit equilateral triangles that make up the n-
iamonds; this triangular lattice is shown in Fig. 5. If the tiling is isohedral and has
p3 or p6 symmetry, then two rotations acting on a single tile can generate the
whole tiling. If the polyiamond is a fundamental domain for the tiling, then in the
p3 case, two inequivalent 3-fold rotation centers will be on the tile’s boundary
(these produce a third inequivalent 3-fold center on the tile’s boundary). In
the p6 case, the tile will have a 6-fold and a 3-fold center on its boundary. [4]
These rotation centers will necessarily occur at lattice points of the underlying
triangular lattice.
To produce a p3 or p6 polyiamond, we follow a sequence of steps similar to
those in the last section, this time beginning with a lattice of unit triangles. For
a p3 n-iamond, we place the ﬁrst 3-fold center (the black circle in Fig. 5) and
call it the origin. For a p6 n-iamond, we ﬁrst place the 6-fold center (the black
circle in Fig. 5) and call it the origin.
The terminus in both cases is a 3-fold center (the white circle in Fig. 5), which
can be written as xu + yv, where u and v are the vectors from the origin along
the edges of the unit triangle as shown in Fig. 5 and x, y = 0, 1, 2, . . .. Rotations

about these centers will generate the p3 or p6 symmetry groups, respectively.
In the case of the p3 symmetry group, the gray circle in Figure 5 indicates the
location of the third kind of 3-fold center.
If we let the area of a unit triangle in the lattice be 1, then the area of a
fundamental domain for a p3 isohedral tiling with symmetry group generated
by rotations about the designated centers is given by
S = 2(x2 + y2 + xy),
i.e., our n-iamonds must have S = n = 2, 6, 8, 14, 18, 24, 26, 32, . . ., and the
area of a fundamental domain for a p6 isohedral tiling with symmetry group
generated by rotations about the black and white circles is given by
S = x2 + y2 + xy,
i.e., our n-iamonds must have S = n = 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 19, 21, . . ..
For given x, y and n, the unit triangles in the triangular lattice are partitioned
into n equivalence classes by the action of the p3 or p6 symmetry groups, and
so we can construct all p3 and p6 n-iamonds with area S using the ‘procedure’
in section 2, taking a unit equilateral triangle in the lattice as the unit shape.
Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 display the list of all p3 n-iamonds for n ≤8 and all p6
n-iamonds for n ≤9, respectively, obtained by the above procedure. The 2 or
3-number labeling system in Fig. 3 is also used in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7.
For each p3 polyiamond, its corresponding p3 tiling is obtained by rotating
the tile 120◦repeatedly about the inequivalent 3-fold centers on its boundary.
For example, tile 6-3 in Fig. 6 produces the tiling shown in Fig. 8 (a). For n > 8
we obtain 288(306) p3 14-iamonds, where the number in parentheses denotes
the number of polyiamonds when those with diﬀerently-placed rotation centers
are distinguished in counting.
For each p6 polyiamond, its corresponding p6 tiling is obtained by repeated
60◦and 120◦rotations about the 6-fold and 3-fold centers on its boundary (shown
as the black and white circles in Fig. 7, respectively). For example, tile 7-2 in
Fig. 7 produces the tiling shown in Fig. 8 (b). For n > 9 we obtain 191(195)
p6 12-iamonds, 472(504) p6 13-iamonds and 1487(1493) p6 16-iamonds, where
the numbers in parentheses denote the number of polyiamonds when those with
diﬀerently-placed rotation centers are distinguished in counting.

p3 Polyhexes
Finally we consider polyhexes. We ﬁrst note that no polyhex can be a funda-
mental domain for a p6 isohedral tiling since a 6-fold center of the tiling can
never occur on the boundary of a polyhex. Thus our ﬁnal consideration is of p3
polyhexes. To produce these, we begin with the regular hexagonal tiling in Fig. 9;
this underlies every edge-to-edge tiling by polyhexes. As before (for p3 polyia-
monds), if the polyhexes we produce are to possibly be fundamental domains for
p3 isohedral tilings, then they must have two inequivalent 3-fold centers on their
boundaries. These centers necessarily will be positioned at vertices of the under-
lying tiling by unit hexagons. We choose a vertex of one hexagon in our regular
hexagonal tiling as origin (the black circle as shown in Fig. 9), then choose a
second vertex of this tiling as terminus (shown as the white circle in Fig. 9). The

hexagonal units. Thus to be a fundamental domain, an n-hex must have area
n = S, which must be an integer, i.e.,
n = 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 12, 13, 16, 19, 21, . . .
For such a given n, we can construct p3 n-hexes by the ‘procedure’ in section 2
by taking the unit shape as a regular hexagon in the hexagonal tiling shown in
Fig. 9.
Fig. 10 is the list of all p3 n-hexes for n ≤7 obtained by the above procedure.
For each p3-polyhex, its corresponding p3 tiling is obtained by 120◦rotations
about the three circles on its boundary (as shown in Fig. 10). For example,
tiles 4-2 and 4-4 in Fig. 10 produce the tilings shown in Fig. 11 (a) and (b),
respectively. For n > 7 we obtain 155(157) p3 9-hexes, where the number in
parentheses denotes the number of polyhexes when those with diﬀerently-placed
rotation centers are distinguished in counting. We observe that each p3 n-hex is
also a p3 6n-polyiamond, distinguished by the property that each of its interior
angles is either 120◦or 240◦. The list of all p3 polyhexes is a small subset of the
set of all p3 polyiamonds.

Summary and Discussion
We have developed computer programs to obtain very fundamental and impor-
tant tiles, that is, p4 polyominoes, p3 and p6 polyiamonds, and p3 polyhexes
according to our improved algorithm. As a result, we could enumerate a list that
contains all polyominoes, polyiamonds and polyhexes of a given size that are
fundamental domains for p4, p3 or p6 isohedral tilings.
The running time of our algorithm is exponential in the length of the output;
however it is polynomial to determine that a given tile has a particular property.
The actual computer time, using an Intel Core Duo 1.83GHz CPU, to obtain
the lists in Fig. 3, Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Fig. 10 was less than two seconds each.
In listing these tiles, it would be interesting to distinguish which of the associ-
ated tilings have symmetries not contained in the rotation symmetry group that

produced the tiling. For p4 tiles, the tiling might have symmetry group p4g or
p4m; for p3 tiles, the tiling might have symmetry group p3m1, p31m, p6 or
p6m; and for p6 tiles, the tiling might have symmetry group p6m. For example,
6-1 in Fig. 6 and 4-4 in Fig. 10 are p3 tiles, but the tilings produced by 120◦ro-
tations about their designated 3-fold centers have additional symmetry, as seen
in Fig. 12 (a) and Fig. 11 (b), respectively. In both cases, the tiles themselves are
symmetric (6-iamond 6-1 has 180◦rotational symmetry and 4-hex 4-4 has 120◦
rotational symmetry and mirror symmetry) and their symmetries are present in
their associated tilings. As a result, the tiles are not fundamental domains for
their associated tilings; rather, a fraction of each tile is a fundamental domain
with respect to the full symmetry group of the tiling.
A symmetric tile does not always produce a tiling having that same symmetry;
an example is shown in Fig. 11 (a), in which the mirror symmetry of tile 4-2
in Fig. 10 is not a symmetry of the tiling. Here the tiling has p3 symmetry
group, and the 4-hex is a fundamental domain for the tiling. Another example is
tile 7-1-2 in Fig. 7. This 7-iamond has 3-fold rotational symmetry, but the tile’s
3-fold center is not a rotation center for the associated tiling shown in Fig. 12
(b), and the tile is a fundamental domain for the tiling.
These examples illustrate the fact that to distinguish tiles in our list that are
not fundamental domains for their associated tilings is not as simple as identi-
fying those tiles that are symmetric. Indeed, to accomplish this, we would have
to investigate polyominoes, polyiamonds and polyhexes that are fundamental
domains for p4g, p4m, p3m1, p31m and p6m from the beginning.

Abstract. A state of a simple graph G is an assignment of either a 0
or 1 to each of its vertices. For each vertex i of G, we deﬁne the move [i]
to be the switching of the state of vertex i, and each neighbor of i, from
0 to 1, or from 1 to 0. The given initial state of G is said to be solvable
if a sequence of moves exists such that this state is transformed into the
0-state (all vertices have state 0.) If every initial state of G is solvable,
we call G a solvable graph. We shall characterize here the solvable trees.

Introduction
The lights out puzzle is played on a rectangular grid, usually 5 × 5. The cells in
the rectangular grid represent rooms. Initially, some cells are lighted and some
are not. When the switch in a cell is toggled, the state of the cell, and that of
each neighboring cell, is switched from lights on to lights oﬀ, or vice versa. If
there is a way to toggle some switches until all lights are oﬀ, we say that the
given initial state is solvable. R. Cowen and J. Kennedy [1] describe this game
using Mathematica.
The usual lights out puzzle can be viewed as a game on a special graph called
the planar grid. J. Goldwasser and W. Klostermeyer [3] considered playing the
game on an arbitrary graph. Since a move switches the state of a vertex, and the
state of every vertex adjacent to it, then we can only play the lights out puzzle
on graphs without loops. We shall consider here the lights out puzzle played on
a tree.
Deﬁnition 1. A state s of a graph G is a function s: V (G) →Z2 = {0, 1}.
Let G be a graph of order n and i ∈V (G). We denote by si or s(i) the image of
i under s. We shall call si the state of vertex i. We will ﬁnd it useful to denote
s by the vector
s =
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎣
s1
s2
...
sn
⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎦
For each vertex i we deﬁne the move [i] to be the switching of the state of
vertex i, as well as the state of each neighbor of i, from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

We may think of [i] as a vector in Zn
2 where the jth component is 1 if j = i or j
is a neighbor of i; else the jth component is 0. Then the new state arising from
move [i] is just s + [i], where addition is taken modulo 2. The sequence of moves
[v1], [v2], . . . , [vk] transforms s to the 0-state (lights out) if and only if
s + [v1] + [v2] + · · · + [vk] = 0
If B(G) is the matrix whose columns are [1], [2], . . ., [n], then s can be trans-
formed into the 0-state if and only if s is a linear combination of the columns
of B. A state that can be transformed into the 0-state is called a solvable state.
A graph is solvable if every initial state of the graph is solvable. Thus, every
initial state is solvable if and only if the columns of B(G) form a basis for Zn
2 .
Let us observe that for any graph G, the solvable states are precisely the linear
combinations of the columns of B(G).

Preliminary Results
From the remark at the end of the preceding section, we obtain the following
characterization of solvable graphs.
Theorem 1. A graph G is solvable if and only if det B(G) ̸≡0 (mod 2).
If G is a graph with components G1, G2, . . . , Gk, then det B(G) =  det B(Gi).
Hence, G is solvable if and only if each Gi is solvable.
Let us observe that if A(G) is the adjacency matrix of a graph G of order n,
then B(G) = A(G) + In, where In is the identity matrix of order n.
The symbol Pn denotes a path of order n. In this paper we shall write
x1x2 · · · xn to denote the path with vertices xi and edges xixi+1, 1 ≤i < n.
The symbol N(x) denotes the set of all vertices in a graph that are adjacent
to x. Elements of N(x) are called neighbors of x. The degree of a vertex x in a
simple graph, denoted by deg(x), is the number |N(x)|. If deg(x) = 1, we call x
a pendant vertex. An edge of the form xx is called a loop and we say that there
is a loop at x. If there is a loop at x, we deﬁne deg(x) = |N(x)| + 1.
An important result, established in [2] for loopless graphs, also holds for graphs
with loops. So we state and prove a more general result here. This is some sort
of a reduction formula.
Lemma 1. Let G be a graph (possibly with loops) and let x and y be vertices in
G such that N(x) ⊆N(y). If G′ is the graph obtained from G by deleting all the
edges of the form yz, where z ∈N(x), then det A(G′) = det A(G).
Proof. For simplicity, let 1, 2, . . . , n be the vertices of G, and, without loss of
generality, let N(1) ⊆N(2). We may assume further that N(1) = {p, p+1, . . . , u}
and N(2) = {q, q + 1, . . . , v} where 1 ≤q ≤p ≤u ≤v. Consider the adjacency
matrix A(G). Subtract row 1 from row 2 and then subtract column 1 from
column 2. The result is a new matrix which is easily seen to be the adjacency
matrix of the graph obtained from G by deleting all edges of the form 2i, where
i ∈N(1).

Graph Pruning Operations
In theory, given a graph G, we can decide whether or not it is solvable by applying
Theorem 1. In practice, this is not easy to do if the graph involved is large in
terms of the number of vertices or the number of edges. It would be nice if we
can say something like “G is solvable if and only if H is solvable” where H is a
smaller graph derived from G by an easy rule or process.
We now deﬁne type I, type II, and type III graph pruning operations. Please
refer to Figure 1.

Fig. 1. The three types of graph pruning operations
I Let x and y be pendant vertices in a graph G having a common neighbor.
Delete x and y to obtain a new graph G′.
II Let P4 = x1x2x3x4 be a path in G such that x1 and x4 are pendant vertices,
deg(x2) = 2, deg(x3) > 2. Delete x1, x2, x3, x4 to obtain a new graph G′′.
III Let P4 = x1x2x3x4 be a path in G such that x1 is a pendant vertex, and
deg(x2) = deg(x3) = 2. Delete x1, x2, x3 to obtain a new graph G′′′.
Theorem 2. Let G be any graph. If G′, G′′, and G′′′ are graphs obtained from
G by a type I, type II, or type III pruning operation respectively, then
det B(G′) ≡det B(G)
(mod 2),
det B(G′′) = −det B(G), and
det B(G′′′) = −det B(G).

Proof. We observe ﬁrst that B(G) is the adjacency matrix of the graph 	G ob-
tained from G by putting a loop at every vertex of G.
(1) Let x and y be pendant vertices of G having common neighbor v. In 	G,
N b
G(x) = {x, v} ⊆N b
G(v). Likewise, N b
G(y) = {y, v} ⊆N b
G(v). Without loss
of generality, let the ﬁrst three rows of B(G) correspond to x, y, v respectively.
Then B(G) has the form
B(G) =
⎡
⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎣
1 0 1 0 · · · 0
0 1 1 0 · · · 0
1 1
0 0 B(G′)
...
0 0
⎤
⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎦
where G′ is the graph obtained from G by deleting x and y. By adding rows 1
and 2 to row 3 (mod 2) we immediately get det B(G) ≡det B(G′) (mod 2).
(2) Let x1x2x3x4 be a path in G where x1 and x4 are pendant vertices, deg x2 =
2 and deg x3 > 2. We consider these four vertices in 	G. By Lemma 1, we can
remove the edges x1x2, x2x2, x3x4 and x3x3. In the resulting graph, the vertex x2
is a pendant vertex. Aside from x2, let v1, v2, . . . , vk be the vertices adjacent to x3.
Note that N(x2) = {x3} ⊆N(vi) for each i. By Lemma 1, we can remove the edges
v1x3, v2x3, . . . , vkx3. The adjacency matrix of the resulting graph has determinant
still equal to det B(G). But this resulting graph consists of 
G′′, two nonadjacent
vertices, namely x1 and x4, each with a loop, and P2 = x2x3. Since det B(P1) = 1
and det A(P2) = −1, then det B(G) = −det A(
G′′) = −det B(G′′).
(3) Let x1x2x3x4 be a path in G with deg(x1) = 1, deg(x2) = deg(x3) = 2.
Consider these vertices in 	G. By Lemma 1, we can remove the edges x1x2 and
x2x2 since N(x1) ⊆N(x2). In the resulting graph, N(x2) = {x3} ⊆N(x4).
Therefore by Lemma 1, we can remove the edge x3x4. This graph now consists
of one isolated vertex x1 with a loop, one P2 = x2x3 with a loop at x3, and 
G′′′.
The graph x1 with a loop has adjacency matrix with determinant 1. The graph
x2x3 with a loop at x3 has adjacency matrix with determinant −1. Therefore,
det B(G) = −det B(G′′′).
⊓⊔
The following Corollary is an easy consequence of Theorem 2.
Corollary 1. Let G be a graph and let G∗be any graph obtained from G by a
sequence of pruning operations. Then, G is solvable if and only if G∗is solvable.
Deﬁnition 2. A graph G is prune-irreducible if no pruning operation can be
applied to G. If some pruning operation applies to G, we say that G is prune-
reducible.
A connected graph without cycles is called a tree. Some examples of prune-
irreducible trees are shown in Figure 2.
The third example in Figure 2 belongs to a class of trees which we shall now
deﬁne. For convenience, a vertex of degree greater than 2 will be called a joint
vertex.

Fig. 2. Prune-irreducible trees
Deﬁnition 3. A tree having at least one joint vertex is called a hard tree if it
satisﬁes the following conditions.
1. Every joint vertex is adjacent to at most one pendant vertex.
2. Every joint vertex that is 2 units away from a pendant vertex is not adjacent
to any pendant vertex.
3. Every pendant vertex is either 1 or 2 units away from the nearest joint vertex.
The next Lemma determines all the prune-irreducible trees.
Lemma 2. The only prune-irreducible trees are P1, P2 and the hard trees.
Proof. It is easily veriﬁed that P1, P2, and hard trees are prune-irreducible. Let
T be any tree which is prune-irreducible. Consider the following cases.
Case 1. T is a path of order n. If n = 3, then T is prune-reducible by type I
operation. If n > 3, then T is prune-reducible by type III operation. Therefore,
T is either P1 or P2.
Case 2. T is not a path. Then T contains some joint vertices. We claim that
T is a hard tree. Suppose not. Then one of the three conditions in the deﬁnition
of a hard tree does not hold. If (1) does not hold, there is a joint vertex adjacent
to at least two pendant vertices. But then a type I pruning operation can be
applied to T . If (2) does not hold, then there is a pendant vertex that is at least
3 units away from the nearest joint vertex. But then a type III pruning operation
can be applied to T . If (3) does not hold, then there is a joint vertex 2 units
away from a pendant vertex and which is also adjacent to a pendant vertex. But
then a type II pruning operation can be applied to T . Hence, T is reducible.
This is a contradiction and so T must be a hard tree.

Solvable Trees
By forest we mean a graph whose components are trees. We now state and prove
our main result.
Theorem 3. A tree is solvable if and only if it can be pruned to a forest con-
taining only isolated vertices.
Proof. A tree is either prune-irreducible or can be pruned to a forest whose
components are prune-irreducible. Since a graph is solvable if and only if each
of its components is solvable, we need to determine only the solvable prune-
irreducible trees. Obviously, P1 is solvable while P2 is not. Let T be a hard tree.
Then there is at least one joint vertex, say v, that is 2 units away from each of two

distinct pendant vertices, say x and y. Now, B(T ) is the adjacency matrix of the
graph 	T obtained by putting a loop at every vertex of T , Applying Lemma 1 to
	T, we may remove the edges xx′, x′x′, yy′, y′y′ where x′ is the unique neighbor of
x and y′ is the unique neighbor of y. Then, x′ and y′ have a common neighbor set
{v}. It follows that the adjacency matrix of the resulting graph has determinant
0. Consequently, |B(T )| ≡0 (mod 2), and T is not solvable. Thus, among the
irreducible trees, only P1 is solvable.
⊓⊔
The last theorem is equivalent to the following.
Theorem 4. A tree is not solvable if and only if it can be pruned to a forest
with some component isomorphic to P2 or to a hard tree.

Abstract. The Ramsey number for a graph G versus a graph H, de-
noted by R(G, H), is the smallest positive integer n such that for any

Introduction
Throughout this paper, all graphs are ﬁnite and simple. Let G be any graph with
the vertex set V (G) and the edge set E(G). The graph G, the complement of G,
is obtained from the complete graph on |V (G)| vertices by deleting the edges of
G. A graph F = (V ′, E′) is a subgraph of G if V ′ ⊆V (G) and E′ ⊆E(G). For
S ⊆V (G), G[S] represents the subgraph induced by S in G. For v ∈V (G) and
S ⊂V (G), the neighborhood NS(v) is the set of vertices in S which are adjacent
to v. Furthermore, we deﬁne NS[v] = NS(v) ∪{u}. If S = V (G), then we use
N(v) and N[v] instead of NV (G)(v) and NV (G)[v], respectively. The degree of a
vertex v in G is denoted by dG(v). The order of G, denoted by |G|, is the number
of its vertices. Let Sn be a star on n vertices and Cm be a cycle on m vertices.
Cocktail-party graph Hs is the graph which is obtained by removing s disjoint
edges from K2s. We denote the complete bipartite whose partite sets are of order
n and p by Kn,p. A windmill graph Mn is a graph on 2n + 1 vertices obtained
from n disjoint triangles by identifying precisely one vertex of every triangle.
Given two graphs G and H, the Ramsey number R(G, H) is deﬁned as the
smallest natural number n such that for any graph F on n vertices, either F
contains G or F contains H. Chv´atal and Harary [3] established a useful and
general lower bound on the exact Ramsey numbers R(G, H) as follows.

Theorem A. [3] Let G and H be two graphs (not necessarily diﬀerent) with no
isolated vertices. Then the following lower bound holds:
R(G, H) ≥(χ(G) −1)(n(H) −1) + 1,
where χ(G) is the chromatic number of G and n(H) is the number of vertices in
the largest component of H.
This result of Chv´atal and Harary has motivated various authors to determined
the Ramsey numbers R(G, H) for many combinations of graphs G and H, see
the nice survey paper [10].
Corollary 1. R(S1+p, C4) ≥(χ(C4) −1)(V (S1+p) −1) + 1 = p + 1.
Some results about the Ramsey numbers for stars versus cycle have obtained.
For instance, Lawrence [7] showed that R(S16, C4) = 20 and
R(S1+n, Cm) =

m if m ≥2n,
2n + 1 if m is odd and m ≤2n + 1
Parsons in [9] considered about the Ramsey numbers for S1+p versus C4 as
presented in Theorem B.
Theorem B. (Parsons’s upper bound [9]) For p ≥2, R(S1+p, C4) ≤p+√p+1.
Recently, Hasmawati et al. [4] and [5] proved that R(S6, C4) = 8, and R(S6,
K2,m) = 13 for m = 5 or 6 respectively.
Recently, Baskoro et al. [1] determined the Ramsey numbers for multiple
copies of a star versus a wheel and for a forest versus a complete graph. Their
results are given in the following three theorems.
Theorem C. [1] If m is odd and 5 ≤m ≤2n −1, then R(kSn, Wm) = 3n −2 +
(k −1)n.
Theorem D. [1] For n ≥3,
R(kSn, W4) =

(k + 1)n if n is even and k ≥2,
(k + 1)n −1 if n is odd and k ≥1.
Theorem F. [1] Let ni ≥ni+1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , k −1. If m is such that ni >
(ni −ni+1)(m −1) for every i, then R(k
i=1 Tni, Km) = R(Tnk, Km)+k−1
i=1 ni.
In this paper, we study the Ramsey numbers for multiple copies of stars versus
small cycle. We determine the Ramsey numbers R(S8, C4) and R(kS1+p, C4) for
p ≥3 and k ≥2.

Main Results
The results are presented in the next two theorems.
Theorem 1. R(S8, C4) = 10.
Proof. Consider F := H4 ∪K1. Clearly, F has nine vertices and contains no S8.
Its complement is isomorphic with M4. Thus it’s clear that M4 contains no C4.

Hence, we have R(S8, C4) ≥10. By Parsons’s upper bound in [9], R(S8, C4) ≤
8 +
√
7. Therefore, we have R(S8, C4) ≤10. Thus, R(S8, C4) = 10.
⊓⊔
Lemma 1. For k ≥2 and p ≥3, R(kS1+p, C4) ≥k(p + 1) + 1
Proof. Let p ≥3 and k ≥2. Consider F := Kk(p+1)−1 ∪K1. F has k(p + 1)
vertices, however it contains no kS1+p. It is easy to see that F is isomorphic
with K1,k(p+1)−1. So, F contains no C4. Hence, R(kS1+p, C4) ≥k(p + 1) + 1.
Theorem 2. For p ≥3, R(2S1+p, C4) = 2(p + 1) + 1 .
Proof. Let F1 be a graph of order 2(p + 1) + 1 for p ≥3. Suppose F 1 contains
no C4. By Parsons’s upper bound, we have |F1| ≥R(S1+p, C4) for p ≥3. Thus
F1 ⊇S1+p. Let V (S1+p) = {v0, v1, . . . , vp} with center v0. Write A = F1\S1+p
and T = F1[A]. Thus |T | = p + 2. If there exists v ∈T with dT (v) ≥p, then
T contains S1+p. Hence F1 contains 2S1+p. Therefore, we assume that for every
vertex v ∈T , dT (v) ≤(p −1).
Let u be any vertex in T . Write Q = T \NT[u]. Clearly, |Q| ≥2. Observe that if
there exists s ∈F1 where s ̸= u which is not adjacent to at least two vertices in
Q, then F[{s, u}∪Q] will contains C4, a contradiction. Hence, for the remaining
of the proof we will use the following assumption.
Assumption 1. Every vertex s ∈F1, s ̸= u is not adjacent to at most one vertex
in Q.
Let u be adjacent to at least p −|NT (u)| vertices in S1+p\{v0}, call them
v1, . . . , vp−|NT (u)|. Observe that p −|NT (u)| = |Q| −1. By Assumption 1, vertex
v0 is adjacent to at least |Q| −1 vertices in Q, namely q1, . . . , qp−|NT (u)|. Then
we have two new stars, namely S′
1+p and S′′
1+p, where
V (S′
1+p) = (S1+p\{v1, . . . , vp−|NT (u)|}) ∪{q1, . . . , qp−|NT (u)|}
with v0 as the center and
V (S′′
1+p) = NT [u] ∪{v1, . . . , vp−|NT (u)|}
with u as the center. Hence, we have F1 ⊇2S1+p.
Now, we assume that u is adjacent to at most p −|NT (u)| −1 vertices in
S1+p\{v0}. This means u is not adjacent to at least |NT (u)| + 1 vertices in
S1+p\{v0}. Let Y = {y ∈S1+p\{v0} : yu /∈E(F1)}. Then |Y | ≥|NT (u)| + 1≥1.
It will be shown that there is y′ ∈Y so that y′ is adjacent to all vertices in
NT (u) (see Fig. 1).
Suppose for every y ∈Y , there exists r ∈NT (u) such that yr /∈E(F1). Since
|NT (u)| < |Y |, then there exists r0 ∈NT (u) so that r0 is not adjacent to at
least two vertices in Y , say y1 and y2. This implies, F1[u, r0, y1, y2] forms a C4, a
contradiction. Hence, there exists y′ ∈Y so that y′ is adjacent to all vertices in
NT (u). Furthermore, by Assumption 1 we have that |NT (y′)| ≥|NT (u)| + |Q| −
1 = |T | −2 = p.

Fig. 1. An illustration of proof of Theorem 2
Let q′ be the vertex in Q which is not adjacent with y′. If v0u /∈E(F1), then v0
must be adjacent to q′. (Otherwise F would contain C4 formed by {v0, y′, q′, u}.)
Now we have two new stars, namely S1
1+p and S2
1+p, where V (S1
1+p) = NT [y′]
with y′ as the center and V (S2
1+p) = (S1+p\{y′}) ∪{q′}. If v0u ∈E(F1), then
we also have two new stars. The ﬁrst one is S1
1+p as in the previous case and the
second one is S3
1+p where V (S3
1+p) = (S1+p\{y′}) ∪{u} with v0 as the center. In
case that y′ is adjacent with all vertices in Q, then the ﬁrst star is NT [y′]\{q}
and the second star is S4
1+p where V (S4
1+p) = (S1+p\{y′}) ∪{q}, q ∈Q with v0
as the center. The fact that v0q ∈E(F) is guaranteed by Assumption 1.
Therefore, we have F1 ⊇2S1+p. Thus R(2S1+p, C4) ≤2(p + 1) + 1. By
Lemma 1 we have R(2S1+p, C4) = 2(p + 1) + 1. The proof is now complete.
⊓⊔
Theorem 3. For p ≥3 and k ≥3, R(kS1+p, C4) = k(p + 1) + 1.
To obtain the Ramsey number we use induction on k. We assume the theorem
holds for every 2 ≤r < k. Let F2 be a graph of order k(p + 1) + 1. Suppose F 2
contains no C4. We will show that F2 ⊇kS1+p. By induction hypothesis, F2 ⊇
(k −1)S1+p. Write B = F2\(k −2)S1+p and T ′ = F2[B]. Thus |T ′| = 2(p+1)+1.
Since T
′ contains no C4 and its follows from Theorem 2 that T ′ contains 2S1+p.
Hence F2 contains (k −2)S1+p ∪2S1+p = kS1+p. Thus we have R(kS1+p, C4) ≤
k(p + 1) + 1. On the other hand, we have R(kS1+p, C4) ≥k(p + 1) + 1 (by
Lemma 1). The assertion follows.

Abstract. For a planar point set P in general position, an empty convex
k-gon or a k-hole of P is a convex k-gon H such that the vertices of H
are elements of P and no element of P lies inside H. Let n(k1, k2, · · · , kl)
be the smallest integer such that any set of n(k1, · · · , kl) points contains
a ki-hole for each i, 1 ≤i ≤l, where the holes are pairwise disjoint. We
evaluate such values. In particular, we show that n(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = 15.

Introduction
We deal with only a ﬁnite number of planar point set P and assume that no three
elements in P are on a line throughout the paper. For Q ⊆P with ch(Q)∩P = Q,
we distinguish the vertices which lie on the convex hull boundary from the
remaining interior points, where ch stands for the convex hull. Let V (Q) be a
set of the vertices and I(Q) be a set of the interior points of Q. We call a subset
Q with k elements of P an empty convex k-gon or a k-hole if V (Q) determines
a k-gon and I(Q) = ∅.
In 1975, Erd˝os [3] asked the following problem: Find the smallest integer
n(k) such that any set of n(k) points contains an empty convex k-gon. Klein
found n(4) = 5 in [4]. Harborth [6] determined n(5) = 10, where he gave the
conﬁguration of 9 points with no empty convex pentagons. Moreover, Horton
[7] constructed sets of arbitrarily many points with no empty convex heptagons,
i.e., n(k) does not exist for k ≥7. For the remaining case of k = 6, Overmars
exhibited a set of 29 points, the largest known, with no empty convex hexagons
in [10]. Most recently, Gerken [5] showed that any set containing a convex 9-gon
also contains an empty convex hexagon. Hence, using the upper bound of Erd˝os-
Szekeres theorem [11], n(6) ≤1717 holds. That is, the current record of n(6) is
30 ≤n(6) ≤1717.
A family of holes {Hi}i∈I is said to be vertex disjoint if V (Hi)∩V (Hj) = ∅for
every pair {i, j} ⊆I. If, moreover, their convex hulls are pairwise disjoint, i.e.,
ch(Hi) ∩ch(Hj) = ∅, we simply say that these holes are disjoint. In this paper,
we study the existence of a few disjoint holes in a given point set: Determine
the smallest integer n(k1, k2, · · · , kl) such that any set of n(k1, k2, · · · , kl) points
in the plane, no three collinear, contains a ki-hole for every i, 1 ≤i ≤l, where
the holes are disjoint. Here, a 1-hole is a point and a 2-hole is a line segment.
Clearly, every 6 point set is partitioned into two disjoint 3-holes, which implies

that n(3, 3) = 6. By Horton’s construction, n(k1, k2) = ∞for k1 ≥7 or k2 ≥7.
In [12], the problem of partitioning a planar point set into disjoint holes is
discussed, and it was shown that every set of 7 points is partitioned into a 3-hole
and a disjoint 4-hole, implying that n(3, 4) = 7. Using this result, we can always
partition any 10 point set into a 1-hole, a 2-hole, a 3-hole and a 4-hole which
are disjoint, i.e., n(1, 2, 3, 4) = 10. We showed that every set of 9 points contains
two disjoint 4-holes in [8], and the conﬁguration of 8 points in Fig. 1(a) does not
contain two disjoint 4-holes, i.e., n(4, 4) = 9. In [9], we introduced the concept
of n(k1, k2) and estimated the following values:
1. n(3, 5) = 10: Every set of 10 points contains a 3-hole and a disjoint 5-hole.
n(3, 5) ≥10 follows immediately from n(5) = 10.
2. 12 ≤n(4, 5) ≤14: Every set of 14 points contains a 4-hole and a disjoint
5-hole. There exists a conﬁgulation of 11 points in Fig. 1(b) without these
two holes.
3. 16 ≤n(5, 5) ≤20: There exists a conﬁgulation of 15 points without two
disjoint 5-holes, and the upper bound is easily shown by n(5) = 10.
The next section gives two new results for n(k1, k2) and we discuss in Section 3
disjoint partitions of any 15 point set into distinct ﬁve holes. We conclude this
paper with some open problems.
Terminologies. We represent a k-hole H by H = (p1p2 · · · pk)k if V (H) =
{p1, p2, · · · , pk} is in counter-clockwise order. Let l(a, b) be the line passing
through a and b. Denote the closed half-plane with l(a, b), which contains c
or does not contain c by H(c; ab) or H(c; ab), respectively. Let S(ab; cd) be the
closed region between l(a, b) and l(c, d), containing {a, b, c, d} when the segments
ab and cd do not intersect. Let R be a region in the plane. An interior point
of R is an element of a given point set P in the interior, and if R contains no
interior points, R is said to be empty.
Denote the convex cone by γ(a; b, c) with apex a, determined by a, b and c.
If γ(a; b, c) is not empty, we deﬁne an attack point from the half-line ab to ac,

denoted by α(a; b, c) as the interior point in γ(a; b, c) such that γ(a; b, α(a; b, c))
is empty. For δ = b or c of γ(a; b, c), let δ′ be a point such that a is on the line
segment δδ′.

Two Disjoint Holes
In this section we prove the next results:
Theorem 1. Any set P of 13 points in the plane, no three collinear, contains
a 4-hole and a disjoint 5-hole, that is, n(4, 5) ≤13.
Theorem 2. There exists a conﬁguration of 16 points in the plane, no three
collinear, without two disjoint 5-holes, that is, n(5, 5) ≥17.
We ﬁrst improve on the upper bound of n(4, 5). In [1], Aichholzer et al. gave
a complete data base of all combinatorial diﬀerent sets of up to 11 points and
showed several combinatorial results. To show Theorem 1, we use their result as
Lemma A.
Lemma A. Any set of 11 points in the plane, no three collinear, contains either
a 6-hole or a 4-hole and a disjoint 5-hole.
Proof (of Theorem 1). We assume by Lemma A that P contains a 6-hole; K =
(v1v2v3v4v5v6)6. Consider the convex regions of E1 = γ(v1; v′
4, v3)∩γ(v3; v1, v′
6),
E2 = γ(v3; v′
6, v5) ∩γ(v5; v3, v′
2) and E3 = γ(v5; v′
2, v1) ∩γ(v1; v5, v′
4). We remark
that if we have a 5-hole and a disjoint convex region with at least 5 points of P,
then we are done by n(4) = 5.
Let Qi be a point set of P\V (K) in Ei for any i. If |Q1| ≥4, i.e., we have
at least 5 points of Q1 ∪{v2} in E1, we have (v1v3v4v5v6)5 and a disjoint 4-hole
in E1. Thus we may assume that |Q1| ≤3. Similarly, we may also assume that
|Qi| ≤3 for i = 2, 3. Hence, it suﬃces to consider the following two cases by
symmetry.
( I ) |Q1| = |Q3| = 3 and |Q2| = 1:
Let Q2={p}. Assume that p is in H(v3; v1v4) by symmetry. If p is in S(v2v3; v1v4),
we have (v1v2v3pv4)5 disjoint from a 4-hole of 5 points of Q3 ∪{v5, v6}. Assume
that p is in γ(v3; v′
2, v′
6). Since E1 ∩S(v2v3; v1v4) is also empty by the same way,
we have 5 points of Q1 ∪{v2, p} in H(v1; v2v3) disjoint from (v1v3v4v5v6)5.
(II) |Q1| = |Q3| = 2 and |Q2| = 3:
We assume that S(v2v5; v1v6) is empty since, otherwise, we have 5 points of
Q2∪{v3, v4} and a 5-hole by {v1, v2, v5, v6, p} for p ∈S(v2v5; v1v6). S(v2v1; v3v6)
is also empty by the same reason. See Fig. 2.
Consider the region R = γ(v1; v′
2, v′
4). We have three subcases according to the
number of points of Q3 in R. If R contains exactly 2 points, we have (v2v3v4v5v6)5
and 5 points of Q1 ∪Q3 ∪{v1} in H(v6; v1v2).
If R has exactly 1 point p, the other point p′ in Q3 is in γ(v6; v′
1, v′
3). Again,
if q ∈Q2 ∪{p′} exists in S(v3v6; v4v5), we have a 5-hole by {v3, v4, v5, v6, q} and

5 points of Q1 ∪{v1, v2, p}. Thus we may assume that S(v3v6; v4v5) is empty.
Then H(v6; v4v5) contains 5 points of Q2 ∪{v4, p′} disjoint from (v1v2v3v5v6)5.
Suppose that R is empty, i.e., Q3 is in γ(v6; v′
1, v′
3). By the same way, assume
that Q1 is in γ(v2; v′
1, v′
5). Note that H(v2; v1v4) contains at least 2 points Q′
2 in
Q2 by symmetry. Therefore, we have at least 5 points of Q1 ∪Q′
2 ∪{v3} disjoint
from (v1v2v4v5v6)5.

Concerning Theorem 2, let us remark the following. To improve on the lower
bound of n(5, 5), we give a symmetric conﬁguration of 16 points P without two
disjoint 5-holes. See Fig. 3. Observe that there does not exist a 5-hole of the 9
point set in any triangle determined by three vertices of P. Moreover, each half-
plane bounded by the line lV (lH) contains no 5-holes of P. If we take any 5-hole
of P, then each subset of the remaining 11 points in a convex region disjoint
from the 5-hole is in one of the above regions. We leave the detailed proof to the
reader.

Several Disjoint Holes
In this section, we study the problem of partitioning a point set into disjoint
holes. Clearly, n(1, 2) = 3, n(1, 3) = n(2, 2) = 4 and n(2, 3) = 5. It is not diﬃcult
to show that every set of 6 points is partitioned into a line segment and a disjoint
empty convex quadrilateral, i.e., n(2, 4) = 6. We have introduced n(1, 2, 3, 4) =
10. In fact, we could determine the several values for n(k1, k2, · · · , kl). We now
show the following main result.
Theorem 3. Any set P of 15 points in the plane, no three collinear, is parti-
tioned into a 1-hole, a 2-hole, a 3-hole, a 4-hole and a 5-hole which are disjoint,
that is, n(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = 15.
To prove this result, we use the following proposition.
Proposition 1. n(2, 3, 5) = 11.
Proof. To prove the lower bound, we give a conﬁguration of 10 points as shown in
Fig. 4, which does not contain a 2-hole, a 3-hole and a 5-hole which are disjoint.
Thus, n(2, 3, 5) ≥11 holds.
We show that any set P of 11 points contains a 2-hole, a 3-hole and a 5-
hole which are disjoint. By n(5) = 10, P contains a 5-hole, denoted by F =
(v1v2v3v4v5)5. Consider a convex cone Ei = γ(vi; vi+1, v′
i−1) for 1 ≤i ≤5. Let
Qi be a point set of P\V (F) in Ei for any i. We assume that |Q1| ≥|Qi| for

any i ̸= 1 w.l.o.g. If |Q1| ≥5, E1 contains a 2-hole and a disjoint 3-hole by
n(2, 3) = 5, and we have a 5-hole F disjoint from these holes. Next, we consider
the other cases.
( I ) |Q1| = 4: If γ1 = γ(v1; v′
2, v′
5) is not empty, we have F and at least 5
points in H(v3; v1v2). Assume that γ1 is empty. If E5 is not empty, there exists
p = α(v5; v1, v′
4). Then we have a 5-hole of (v1v3v4v5p)5 and exactly 5 points
of Q1 ∪{v2}. Thus, E5 is also empty. By the same reason, we assume that
E3 ∩H(v3; v4v5) is empty.
If q = α(v2; v1, v′
3) exists as shown in Fig. 5, γ(v2; q, v′
1) contains exactly 3
interior points, i.e., a 3-hole exists in it. As for the other two holes, if there exists
a point r in E2, we have the line segment v3r and (v2v4v5v1q)5. If E2 is empty,
we have a 5-hole F and the remaining 2 points in H(v3; v4v5).
Suppose that γ(v2; v1, v′
3) is empty. Again, if E2 is not empty, H(v1; v2v3)
contains at least 5 points disjoint from F. If E2 is empty, we obtain F, a 3-hole
in Q1 and a 2-hole in H(v3; v4v5).
(II) |Q1| = 3: We consider the location of the remaining 3 points. If any other
Ei contains at least 2 points, we have a 2-hole of Qi, a 3-hole of Q1 and a 5-hole
F. We now assume that E2 = ∅and |Qi| = 1 for i = 3, 4, 5. Let Q3 = {p} and
Q4 = {q}. If p is in H(v3; v4v5), there exists the line segment pq disjoint from F
and a 3-hole of Q1. Suppose that p is in H(v3; v4v5). Then there exists a 5-hole
(pv4v1v2v3)5 disjoint from qv5. We argue for any other cases by the same way.

(III) |Q1| = 2: We need three subcases according to the location of the remaining
4 points.
(a) |Qi| = 1 for each i = 2, 3, 4, 5: Let Qi = {pi} for any i ̸= 1.
Suppose ﬁrst that p2 is in H(v2; v3v4). If p4 is in H(v4; v1v5), we have a 2-hole
of Q1, (p4p5v5)3 and (p2v3v4v1v2)5. Thus, p4 is in H(v4; v1v5). Then if p3 is in
H(v5; v1v4) or H(v5; v1v4), we have (p3p4v4)3 and (p2v3v5v1v2)5, or (p3v4v3)3
and (p2p4v5v1v2)5, respectively.
Suppose that p2 is in H(v2; v3v4). We consider the location of p5. If p5 is in
H(v5; v1v2), we have a 2-hole of Q1, (p2p3v3)3 and (p5v1v2v4v5)5. If not so, we
have a 3-hole of Q1 ∪{p5} disjoint from p2p3 and F.
(b) |Q2| = 2: If γ(v1; v′
2, v′
5) is not empty, we have a 3-hole in H(v3; v1v2), a
2-hole of Q2 and F. Thus, γ(v1; v′
2, v′
5) is empty. Then if E5 is not empty, i.e.,
there exists p = α(v5; v1, v′
4), we have a 2-hole of Q1, a 3-hole of Q2 ∪{v3} and
(pv1v2v4v5)5. Thus, E5 is empty. By the same reason, E3 ∩H(v3; v4v5) is empty.
Let K be the 2-hole in E3 ∪E4. If q = α(v2; v′
1, v′
3) exists in E1, we have a
3-hole of Q2 ∪{q} disjoint from F and K. If γ(v2; v′
1, v′
3) is empty, we have K,
a 3-hole of Q2 ∪{v3} and (rv2v4v5v1)5 for r = α(v2; v1, v′
3).
We remark that we are immediately done when we have such two consecutive
convex cones Ei’s, each of which contains exactly 2 interior points.
(c) |Q4| = 2: We assume that Q5 is empty. In fact, if not so, there exists
p = α(v5; v1, v′
4). If p is in H(v5; v1v2), we have (pv1v3v4v5)5, a 3-hole of Q1∪{v2}
and a 2-hole of Q4. If not, there exists a 3-hole of Q1 ∪{p} disjoint from a 2-hole
of Q4 and F. By the same way, E2 ∩H(v2; v3v4) is empty. See Fig. 6. Here, we
can assume that |Q2| = |Q3| = 1 by (III-b).
If q = α(v2; v1, v′
3) exists in E1, we have (qv2v3v4v1)5, a 3-hole of Q4 ∪{v5}
and a 2-hole of Q2∪Q3. If E1 ∩γ(v2; v1, v′
3) is empty, we have a 3-hole of Q1∪Q2
disjoint from F and a 2-hole of Q4.

Theorem 3. n(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = 15.
Proof. It is trivial that n(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) ≥15. For the upper bound, it suﬃces to
show n(2, 3, 4, 5) ≤15, i.e., any set P of 15 points contains a 2-hole, a 3-hole, a
4-hole and a 5-hole which are disjoint.
If we ﬁnd a 4-hole and a disjoint convex region with the remaining 11 points,
we are done by Proposition 1. Then there exists a straight line which separates
the 4-hole from the other 11 points. We call such a line a cutting line through
two elements u and v in P, denoted by L4(u, v). We remark that n(2, 3, 4) = 9
by n(3, 4) = 7. Therefore, if there exists a cutting line L5(u, v) which separates
a 5-hole from the remaining at least 9 points, we also ﬁnd the desired sets.
Let V (P) = {v1, v2, · · · , vl} in counter-clockwise order. We consider any edge
vivi+1 of V (P). Let △abc = ch({a, b, c}) for elements a, b and c of P. If △vi−1vivi+1
is empty, we have a cutting line L4(vi+1, p) for p = α(vi+1; vi−1, v′
i), which sepa-
rates (pvi−1vivi+1)4 from the remaining 11 points. Suppose that △vi−1vivi+1 is
not empty. Then q = α(vi+1; vi, vi−1) exists. If γ(q; vi+1, v′
i) is not empty, we also
have a cutting line L4(q, r) as shown in Fig. 7. Therefore, we can assume that
there is a point pi of P for each vivi+1 s.t. γ(vi; vi+1, pi) ∪γ(vi+1; vi, pi) = ∅.
We call this pi a friend of vivi+1. We remark that pi ̸= pj for i ̸= j, i.e.,
|P| ≥2|V (P)|.
Consider any consecutive edges, say v1v2 and v2v3 with their friends p1, p2.
Let T be a subset with V (T ) = {v2, p2, p1}. We have the cases according to the
number of the interior points of T . Let I(R) be the interior points of a region R.
( I ) I(T ) = ∅: If △p1p2v3 is not empty, we have a cutting line L4(p1, q) for
q = α(p1; p2, v3). Thus, we can assume that △p1p2v3 is empty. If △v1p1v3 is not
empty, we also have a cutting line L4(v3, α(v3; p1, v1)). Thus, we can assume that
△v1p1v3 is also empty, i.e., |V (P)| ≥4. Then we have a cutting line L5(v3, r)
for r = α(v3; v1, v4), separating (rv1p1p2v3)5 from the remaining 9 points. See
Fig. 8.
(II) |I(T )|=1: Let I(T )={q}. If △qp2v3 is not empty, we have L4(q, α(q; p2, v3)).
Thus, we can assume that △qp2v3 is empty. If △qv3p1 is empty, we also have
L5(p1, α(p1; v3, v′
2)) separating (p1qp2v3α(p1; v3, v′
2))5. Hence, we assume that
△qv3p1 is not empty, and there exists a point r = α(v3; q, p1) in it. We remark
that r is in γ(v2; q, p1) since, otherwise, L4(r, v3) separates (rqv2p2)4.

Again, if γ(r; v3, q′) is not empty, we have L5(r, α(r; v3, q′)) separating
(rqp2v3α)5. If it is empty, L4(q, r) separates (rqp2v3)4.
(III) |I(T )| = 2: Let T ′ = T \{v2}, where |V (T ′)| = 3, 4. For |V (T ′)| = 3,
let q ∈V (T ′) and I(T ′) = {r}. Assume that r is in γ(v2; p2, q) by symmetry,
then we have L4(p2, r) separating (v2p2rq)4. For |V (T ′)| = 4, if △p1p2v3 is
empty, L5(p1, v3) separates a 5-hole of T ′ ∪{v3}, and if not empty, we also have
L5(p1, α(p1; p2, v3)).
(IV) Otherwise: Let Ti be a triangle with V (Ti) = {vi, pi, pi−1} for any i where
T = T2. Since |P| = 15 and |I(Ti)| ≥3 for every i, we assume that |V (P)| = 3
and |I(Ti)| = 3 for i = 1, 2, 3 and △p1p2p3 is empty. See Fig. 9.
Again, consider T ′ = T \{v2}. If |V (T ′)| = 5, L5(p1, p2) separates a 5-hole of
T ′. For |V (T ′)| = 3, let q ∈V (T ′) and r = α(p2; q, p1). For the location of r, since
we have L4(p2, r) if r is in γ(v2; q, p2), we can assume that r is in γ(v2; q, p1).
Then if γ(r; p′
2, p1) is empty, L4(r, p1) separates (qrp1v2)4, and if not, we also
have L4(r, α(r; p′
2, p1)).
Suppose that |V (T ′)| = 4. Let V (T ′) = {p2, q, r, p1} in clockwise order and
I(T ′) = {s}. If s is in △qp2p3, we have the line segment v1v2, a 3-hole of I(T1),
(rqsp3p1)5 and a 4-hole of the remaining 5 points of I(T3)∪{p2, v3} by n(4) = 5.
Since the same situation occurs if s is in △rp3p1, we can assume that s is in

△qp3r. Then if v2 is in γ(p3; q, r), L4(p1, p2) separates (qsrv2)4. Thus, v2 is in
γ(p3; p2, q) by symmetry and consider t = α(p2; p3, v3). Then we ﬁnally obtain
(p3qv2p2t)5 and a 2-hole of I(T3)\{t}, and I(H(s; qp3)) contains a 3-hole and a
4-hole by n(3, 4) = 7.

Final Remarks
We ﬁrst remark the case for n(2, k). We introduced n(2, 4) = 6 in Section 3, and
n(2, 5) = 10 holds by n(3, 5) = 10 and n(5) = 10. In Section 2, we established
new bounds for n(4, 5) and n(5, 5). Although n(4, 5) = 12 or 13, we have not
determined a non-trivial upper bound of n(5, 5). We do not argue the value of
n(k, 6) since the valid value is not known yet. For n(k1, k2, k3), we can inductively
show the several values. For example,
1. n(2, 3, 4) ≤n(3) + n(2, 4) = 9 implies n(2, 3, 4) = 9.
2. n(3, 4, 4) ≤n(4) + n(3, 4) = 12, so n(3, 4, 4) = 12 (See Fig. 10(a)).
3. n(4, 4, 4) ≤n(4) + n(4, 4) = 14, so n(4, 4, 4) = 14 (See Fig. 10(b)).
(a) n(3, 4, 4) ≥12
(b) n(4, 4, 4) ≥14
Fig. 10.
It is not so diﬃcult to prove the following (i), (ii) and (iii). Our open problems
are to determine their exact values.
(i) 12 ≤n(3, 3, 5) ≤13. (ii) 13 ≤n(3, 4, 5) ≤14. (iii) 15 ≤n(4, 4, 5) ≤17.
In [8], we introduced the following: Given natural numbers k and n, let Fk(n)
denote the maximum number of pairwise disjoint empty convex k-gons that can
be found in every n point set in the plane, no three collinear. As for F5(n) we
have 2⌊n/n(5, 5)⌋≤F5(n). Concerning the upper bound, the conﬁguration in
Fig. 3 shows that F5(n) ≤1 for n ≤16. In this connection, B´ar´any and K´arolyi
showed that F5(n) < n/6 in [2].

Abstract. Chv´atal deﬁned a skew partition of a graph G to be a par-
tition of its vertex set into two non-empty parts A and B such that
A induces a disconnected subgraph of G and B induces a disconnected
subgraph of G. Skew partitions are important in the characterization of
perfect graphs. De Figuereido et al. presented a polynomial time algo-
rithm which given a graph either ﬁnds a skew partition or determines
that no such partition exists. It runs in O(n101) time. We present an
algorithm for the same problem which runs in O(n4m) time.

Introduction
A skew partition of a graph G = (V, E) is a partition of V into two nonempty
sets A and B such that G[A] is not connected and G[B] is not connected. If
such a partition exists, B is called a skew cutset. Clearly, a skew partition (A, B)
of G yields a skew partition (B, A) of G. It is this self-complementarity which
ﬁrst suggested that these partitions might be important to an understanding
of the structure of perfect graphs. A graph is perfect if each induced subgraph
has chromatic number equal to the size of its largest clique. A graph is Berge
if it contains neither an induced odd chordless cycles of length at least ﬁve or
the complement of such a cycle. Berge introduced these two classes of graph and
proposed the Strong Perfect Graph Conjecture that, in fact, they are identical [1].
Speculating that skew partitions might play a key role in a decomposition
theorem for Berge graphs which would imply the Strong Perfect Graph Conjec-
ture, Chv´atal [3] introduced skew partitions and conjectured that no minimal
imperfect graph permits a skew partition. Both his speculation and his conjec-
ture were accurate. Indeed, Chudnovsky, Robertson, Seymour, and Thomas [2]
recently proved every Berge graph either:

graphs, their complements, bipartite graphs, their complements, or double
split graphs), or

(b) Permits one of three partitions (a proper 2-join, a homogeneous pair, or a
special type of skew partition which they call balanced1.
It was known that the ﬁrst two of these three partitions could not occur in
a minimal imperfect graph (see [5] and [4]). Chudnovsky et al. also proved that
balanced skew partitions cannot occur in a smallest minimal imperfect Berge
graph. These results taken together imply the Strong Perfect Graph Conjecture.
This paper presents a polynomial time algorithm to test if a graph has a skew
partition. This is not the ﬁrst such algorithm. In [6], de Figuereido, Klein, Ko-
hayakawa and Reed present one whose running time is O(n101). In this paper
we present an algorithm with running time O(n4m). We note that in related
work, Trotignon has concurrently and independently developed an O(n9) algo-
rithm for determining if a Berge graph has a balanced skew cutset and proves
that determining if an arbitrary graph has such a cutset is NP-hard [11]. In §2,
we present a preliminary discussion of our method for ﬁnding skew partitions.
In §3, we present our O(n4m) time algorithm to ﬁnd a skew partition. We as-
sume the reader is familar with the standard deﬁnitions and notations of perfect
graph theory which can be found in [8]. We warn the reader that, following the
conventions of that ﬁeld, by a subgraph we mean an induced subgraph.
2
The Idea
Our algorithm breaks the problem up into two subproblems. We ﬁrst check if
the graph has a special kind of skew partition known as a T -cutset. We then
look for skew partitions which are not T -cutsets. T -cutsets are easy to handle,
so we treat them ﬁrst.
Ho`ang [7] deﬁned a T -cutset as a skew cutset B where there exist two vertices
x and y, such that x and y are in diﬀerent components of G −B and some
component of G[B] is contained in N(x) ∩N(y). For a subset of the vertex set
S = {s1, s2, . . . , si}, let N(S) = i
j=1 N(sj).
Lemma 1. There is an O(n3m) time algorithm to decide whether a graph G
contains a T -cutset.
Proof. Consider every pair of vertices x, y and component C of G[N(x) ∩N(y)].
If B is a T -cutset separating x from y such that C is a component of G[B]
then B ⊆C ∪N(C)−x−y. Moreover, G[C ∪N(C) −x −y] is disconnected. So
C ∪N(C)−x−y is also a T -cutset separating x from y. Given x, y and C we can
test if C ∪N(C) −x −y is a T -cutset in O(m) time (by testing the connectivity
of G[V −(C ∪N(C) −x −y)]). So, we can test if any T -cutset corresponding to
such a triple exists in O(n3m).
1 A skew partition (A, B) is balanced if every path P = {v1, v2, ..., vk−1, vk} in G of
length at least 2 such that v1 and v2 are in B and v2, ..., vk−1 are in A has even
length, and if every path P = {v1, v2, ..., vk−1, vk} in G of length at least 2 such that
v1 and v2 are in A and v2, ..., vk−1 are in B has even length.

Fast Skew Partition Recognition
103
Our approach to looking for skew cutsets which are not T -cutsets is motivated
by Reed’s algorithm [9] for ﬁnding skew cutsets in bipartite graphs (in which
case they are complete bipartite subgraphs). So, we ﬁrst brieﬂy sketch the ideas
of this algorithm.
Suppose we have a bipartite graph with bipartition (S, T ). Reed’s approach
was to ask, for each k, if there is a skew cutset B with |B ∩T | = k. Since we
know G has no T -cutsets, we can restrict our attention to skew cutsets B with
|N(x)∩N(y)| < k for every pair of vertices x and y of S in diﬀerent components
of G −B. On the other hand, if x and y are two vertices of B ∩S then the
intersection of their neighbourhoods contains B ∩T and thus has at least k
vertices. Hence, B ∩S is a clique cutset in the auxiliary graph whose vertex set
is S and where two vertices are adjacent if their neighbourhoods intersect in at
least k vertices.
Therefore, we need only check if this auxiliary graph contains a clique cutset
which corresponds to a skew cutset of G. As not every clique cutset of the auxil-
iary graph corresponds to a skew cutset, we use an algorithm due to Tarjan [10]
to construct a structure known as a clique cutset tree, and then do a bit more
work, to determine if the auxiliary graph has the desired special clique cutset.
We omit further details in this preliminary discussion.
Bipartite graphs are rather special in that any skew cutset B consists of
exactly two stable sets. Furthermore, every vertex sees vertices in only one stable
set of B. So, bounding the size of the stable sets of B bounds the size of N(x) ∩
N(y) for x and y in diﬀerent components of G −C. This is not true in general
graphs which complicates our cutset ﬁnding algorithm.
For each vertex r of the graph and every pair of integers k1 and k2, with
k2 ≤k1 we ask if there is a skew cutset B such that
(a) r ∈B,
(b) some largest component L of G[B] has size k1, r ̸∈L, and
(c) the component U of G[B] containing r has size k2.
Given such a skew cutset B, for any two nonadjacent vertices x and y of B,
either N(x) ∩N(y) contains V (L) and hence
(i) some component of G[N(x) ∩N(y)] has size at least k1,
or x and y are in L and hence V (U) is contained in N(x) ∩N(y), so
(ii) some component of G[N(x) ∩N(y)] contains r and has size at least k2.
On the other hand, if x and y are in diﬀerent components of G −B then they
are not adjacent and N(x) ∩N(y) ⊆B. The key lemma is the following:
Lemma 2. Suppose B is a skew cutset of G which is not a T -cutset and B
satisﬁes (a)–(c). If x, y are vertices of diﬀerent components of V −B, then
neither (i) nor (ii) holds for x, y.
As in the bipartite case, we let H be an auxiliary graph with vertex set V where
vertices x and y are adjacent if they are adjacent in G or if they satisfy either

(i) or (ii). Lemma 2 implies that such a skew cutset B is a clique cutset of H.
As we describe in the next section, we use these ideas to develop an algorithm
for ﬁnding the desired skew cutset.
3
The Details
This section presents the details of the skew partition algorithm for general
graphs sketched in the previous section. In particular, we prove our main result:
Theorem 1. Let G be a graph. There exists an O(n4m) algorithm to ﬁnd a
skew cutset in G or decide that no such cutset exists.
By Lemma 1, we can check if G contains a T -cutset in O(n3m) time. Henceforth,
we assume G contains no T -cutset. For each vertex r and each pair of integers
0 ≤k2 ≤k1 ≤n −k2, we search for a skew cutset B satisfying (a)–(c). In
Lemma 4, we show for each such triple (k1, k2, r) an O(nm) algorithm to check
if the desired skew cutset exists or return that no such cutset exists. Thus, our
algorithm to ﬁnd a skew cutset in G or decide that no such cutset exists takes
O(n4m) time.
We create an auxiliary graph H whose vertex set is V (G) and for which xy
is an edge of H if either xy is an edge of G or one of (i) and (ii) holds for x, y.
The previous section showed B induces a clique cutset in H. As not every clique
cutset of H is a skew cutset of G, we need to check if H contains a clique cutset
whose vertices induce a skew cutset of G. To do so, we use an auxiliary structure
known as a clique cutset tree.
A clique cutset tree for a graph F consists of a rooted tree T with root r such
that (I) every node t of T is labelled with a subgraph Ft of F, in particular,
Fr = F, (II) if node t has children s1, . . . , si, then Ft = Fs1 ∪... ∪Fsi and
Fs1 ∩... ∩Fsi, which we denote Kt, is a clique cutset of Ft, and (III) if l is a leaf
of T then Fl has no clique cutset. We note that clique cutset trees have been
well studied in the context of perfect graphs and refer the interested reader to
[8] for more details.
Let T be a clique cutset tree for H. For the root w of T , trivially, Hw contains
every clique cutset of H. For any leaf l of T , by deﬁnition, Hl does not contain
any clique cutset. On the other hand, every clique is contained in some leaf of
the clique cutset tree. Thus, for every clique cutset C there exists a node s of
T such that C is contained in Hs, C is not a cutset of Hs and C is a cutset
of Ht for the parent t of s. Thus, our clique cutset K, if it exists, corresponds
to a skew cutset of G for which conditions (a)–(c) from §2 hold for the triple
(r, k1, k2), and such that for some node s of T
(d) K is contained in Hs,
(e) K is not a cutset of Hs, and
(f) K is a cutset of Ht, where t is the parent of s.
In looking for skew cutsets satisfying (d)–(f) for a node s with parent t in T ,
the following will be useful:

Lemma 3. Let K be a clique cutset in H whose vertices induce a skew cutset B
in G such that conditions (a)–(f) are satisﬁed for some node s of T with parent
t. Then s has a sibling u in T such that Hs −K and Hu −Kt are in diﬀerent
components of G −B.
Proof. Let R = Hs−K. By (e), R is connected in H. We now show R is contained
in the same component of G −B. Assume this is not the case and let C1 and
C2 be two components of G −B such that C1 ∩R ̸= ∅and C2 ∩R ̸= ∅. Let c1
be in C1 ∩R and c2 be in C2 ∩R. As R is connected, there exists some path
PH = p1p2...pk in R where p1 = c1 and pk = c2. Let pi be the ﬁrst vertex not
contained in C1. But, as pi−1pi ̸∈E(G) and pi−1pi ∈E(H), pi−1 and pi must
therefore satisfy (i) or (ii) and contradict Lemma 2. This contradiction shows
that R is indeed in a single component of G −B.
Let the other children of t be u1, . . . , uk, and for i = 1, . . . , k let Ri = Hui−Kt.
Every component Ri is disjoint from Hs and, by (d), disjoint from K. By an
identical argument presented for R, Ri is contained in a single component of
G −B. Finally, as K is a clique cutset of Ht and R is connected in G −B there
exists some i for which Ri and R are in diﬀerent components of Ht −K. As
E(G) ⊆E(H) and K corresponds to B, it follows that Ri and R are in diﬀerent
components of G −B.
This claim leads to the following algorithm.
Lemma 4. There is an O(nm) time algorithm to decide whether there exists a
clique cutset K of H corresponding to a skew cutset in G satisfying (a)–(c).
Proof. We begin by building a clique cutset tree T for H, which as shown by
Tarjan [10], can be constructed in O(nm) time. Tarjan’s algorithm constructs
a clique cutset tree with at most n −1 leaf nodes and such that every internal
node of this tree has exactly two children.
For each node s where Hs is a clique, we ﬁrst check if Hs induces a skew
cutset in G in O(n + m) time and henceforth assume that if K exists it is
properly contained in Hs for some s. We then use an O(n + m) time algorithm
which decides for a ﬁxed sibling pair s, u in T with parent t if there exists a clique
cutset K corresponding to a skew cutset in G satisfying (a)–(f) such that Hs−K
and Hu −Kt are in diﬀerent components of G−B. Either we ﬁnd the desired K
or we check all sibling pairs, in which case Lemma 3 implies G contains no skew
cutset. As there are at most n−1 sibling pairs, we have the desired O(nm) time
algorithm. All that remains to be shown is the O(n + m) algorithm.
For ﬁxed siblings s, u in T , let t be their parent. Our algorithm maintains two
vertex sets: the set R′ containing vertices which must be in the same component
of G −B as Hu −K and the set K′ containing vertices of Hs which must be
in K. Initially let R′ and K′ be empty. We use the standard depth ﬁrst search
algorithm with the following changes: 1) we start the search from any unseen
node in Hu −Kt, 2) for each node seen which is not contained in Hs we add it
to R′ and continue the search as normal from this node, and 3) for each node
seen in Hs we add it to K′ and do not continue searching any deeper from this

node. If our search ends, then if Hu −(Kt ∪R′) ̸= ∅we restart the search at any
node in Hu −(Kt ∪R′), otherwise we terminate the search. These modiﬁcation
maintain the O(n + m) running time of depth ﬁrst search.
After the search if K′ = Hs then the desired skew cutset does not exist. If not
then the set K′ is a cutset and we need only check if it is contained in a skew
cutset in G. If G[K′] is disconnected then K′ is itself a skew cutset. Otherwise, if
K′ is part of a skew cutset then K′ must be contained in one of its components.
Let J = N(K′) ∩Hs. If J = ∅, then the desired skew cutset does not exist. If
(K′ ∪J) ̸= Hs, then (K′ ∪J) is the desired skew cutset. If (K′ ∪J) = Hs and
|J| = 1 then the desired skew cutset does not exist. Otherwise, if |J| > 1 then
for any vertex v of J, we have that K′ ∪{v} is the desired skew cutset. It follows
these steps take O(n+m) running time, so together with the search we have the
desired O(n + m) algorithm.

Concluding Remarks
Reed’s algorithm for ﬁnding a clique cutset in a bipartite graph [9] does not
use Tarjan’s algorithm [10] for ﬁnding a clique cutset. We can improve the run
time of this algorithm to O(n2m) by using the ideas presented in Section 2 and
Lemma 4. This follows from the proof of Reed’s algorithm as its run time is
O(n × (f1 + f2)) where f1 is the run time for constructing a clique cutset tree
and f2 is run time for the algorithm presented in Lemma 4.

Introduction
Let G be a graph with vertex set V (G) and edge set E(G). For a vertex x of G
the degree of x in G is denoted by dG(x) and set δ(G) =
min
x∈V (G) dG(x). Let g and
f be two integer-valued functions deﬁned on V (G) such that 0 ≤g(x) ≤f(x)
for every x ∈V (G). Then a (g, f)-factor of G is a spanning subgraph H of G
satisfying g(x) ≤dH(x) ≤f(x) for all x ∈V (H). In particular, if G itself is a
(g, f)-factor, then G is called a (g, f)-graph. Let a and b be two non-negative
integers. If g(x) = a and f(x) = b for every x ∈V (G), then a (g, f)-factor is
called an [a, b]-factor. If g(x) = f(x) for all x ∈V (G), then a (g, f)-factor is
called an f-factor. If a = b = k, an [a, b]-factor is called a k-factor. In particular,
a 1-factor is also called a perfect matching. Let G be a connected graph and
S ⊂V (G). Denote the number of components of G −S by ω(G −S). The
toughness of G is deﬁned to be
t(G) = min{
|S|
ω(G −S) : S ⊂V (G), ω(G −S) ≥2}.
The binding number of a graph G is deﬁned to be
bind(G) = min{NG(X)
|X|
: φ ̸= X ⊂V (G), NG(x) ̸= V (G)}
where NG(x) = {y : yx ∈E(G), x ∈X}. Let G be a graph and let S and T
be two disjoint subsets of V (G). Then EG(S, T ) denotes the set of edges in G
joining S and T and eG(S, T ) = |EG(S, T )|. A component C of G −(S ∪T ) is
odd or even according to whether eG(T, V (C)) + 
x∈V (C) f(x) is odd or even.
The number of odd components of G −(S ∪T ) is denoted by hG(S, T ). For
convenience, sometimes we write f(S) = 
x∈S f(x) and dG(S) = 
x∈S dG(x).

Some Results on Fractional Graph Theory
109
In the following we give some basic results on factors which are very important
for our fractional factors.
Theorem 1.1. [21] A graph G has a 1-factor if and only if for any S ⊂V (G),
q(G −S) ≤|S| where q(G −S) is the number of odd components of G −S.
Theorem 1.2. [13] Let G be a graph and let g, f be two integer-valued functions
deﬁned on V (G) such that 0 ≤g(x) ≤f(x) for all x ∈V (G). Then G has a
(g, f)-factor if and only if for all disjoint subsets S and T of V (G)
δG(S, T ) =

x∈T
(dG−S(x) −g(x)) −hG(S, T ) +

x∈S
f(x) ≥0.

V (G),
a−1

j=0
(a −j)Pj(G −S) ≤b|S|
where Pj(G −S) = |{x : dG−S(x) = j}|.
Many other results on factors can be found in [1].
In this paper we will convert integer-based deﬁnitions and invariants into their
fractional analogues. Find the relationships of the programming and the graph
theory.Some results on fractional factors, fractional Hamilton graphs, fractional
(g, f)-factors and fractional colorings are presented. In particular, our some new
results on fractional (g, f)-factors are given. Furthermore, some open problems
are presented.

Some Results on Fractional Matching
A fractional matching is a function h that assigns to each edge of a graph a
number in [0, 1] so that, for each vertex x , we have  h(e) ≤1 where the sum
is taken over all edges incident to x. If h(e) ∈{0, 1} for every edge e, then h
is just a matching, or more precisely, the indicator function of a matching. The
fractional matching number μh(G) of a graph G is the supremum of

e∈E(G)
h(e)
over all fractional matchings h. It is clear that μh(G) ≥μ(G) where μ(G) is the
matching number of G. The following results are based on the work of Balas,
Balinski, Bourjolly, Lov´asz, Plummuer, Pulleyblank, and Uhry and so on.
Theorem 2.1. [20] μh(G) ≤1
2|V (G)|.
Theorem 2.2. [9] If G is bipartite, then μh(G) = μ(G).
Theorem 2.3. [3] For any graph G, 2μh(G) is an integer. Moreover, there is a
fractional matching h for which

e∈E(G)
h(e) = μh(G)
such that h(e) ∈{0, 1/2, 1} for every edge e.

A fractional transversal of graph G is a function p : V (G) →[0, 1] satisfying

x∈e
p(x) ≥1 for every e ∈E(G). The fractional transversal number is the inﬁ-
mum of

x∈V (G)
p(x) taken over all fractional transversals p of G.
Theorem 2.4. [20] For every graph G, there is a fractional transversal p for
which

x∈V (G)
p(x) = μh(G)
such that p(x) ∈{0, 1/2, 1} for every vertex x.
Suppose that h is a fractional matching. Then h is a fractional 1-factor (or perfect
matching) if and only if for every x ∈V (G), 
e∋x
h(e) = 1.
Theorem 2.5 (Fractional Tutte’s Theorem). [14] A graph G has a frac-
tional 1-factor (or perfect matching) if and only if
i(G −S) ≤|S|
for every set S ⊆V (G) where i(G −S) is the number of isolated vertices of
G −S.
Theorem 2.6 (Fractional Berge’s Theorem). [19] For any graph G,
μh(G) = 1
2(|V (G)| −max{i(G −S) −|S|})
where the maximum is taken over all S ⊆V (G).
The above results can be proved by graph theory method or programming
method and they are basic for our fractional factor theory. Now we give some
new results on fractional matching which obtained by us. At ﬁrst we introduce
two concepts. The ﬁrst one is introduced by author. The isolated toughness of
G is deﬁned as
I(G) = min{
|S|
i(G −S) : S ⊂V (G), i(G −S) ≥2}.
if G is not complete. Otherwise, I(G) = ∞[22]. If graph G has a k-matching
(a matching with k edges) and for any k-matching M graph G has a fractional
1-factor containing M, then we say that G is fractional k-extendable.
Theorem 2.7. [15] Let G be a graph and k be a non-negative integer. If the
connectivity κ(G) ≥2k + 1, I(G) ≥k + 1 and |V (G)| ≥2k + 1, then G is
fractional k-extendable.
Theorem 2.8. [17] Let G be a graph with |V (G)| ≥2k + 4 and let F be an
arbitrary 1-factor of G. If G −{u, v} is fractional k-extendable for each e =
uv ∈F, then G is fractional k-extendable.

Some Results on Fractional Graph Theory
111
Theorem 2.9. [23] A graph G has a fractional 1-factor if and only if bind(G) ≥1.
Theorem 2.10. [12] Let G be a graph. Then μh(G) = μ(G) if and only if D(G)
is an independent set where D(G) is the set of all vertices in G which are missed
by at least one maximum matching of G.
Finally we present the following problems.
Problem 2.1. Find the relationship between binding number and fractional k-
extendable of a graph.
Problem 2.2. Give an algorithm for determining whether a graph is fractional
k-extendable.
Many problems on fractional graph theory can be solved in polynomial time
by a linear programming. The constraint matrix in fractional matching number
problem has size |V (G)|×|E(G)|. Thus polynomial linear programming solutions
for this problem exist. Therefore the fractional matching number of a graph can
be computed in polynomial time [20].

Fractional Hamiltonian Graphs
A graph G is called fractionally Hamiltonian if there is a function h : E(G) →
[0, 1] such that the following two conditions hold

e∈E(G)
h(e) = |V (G)|
and for all ∅⊂S ⊂V (G)

e∈[S, ¯S]
h(e) ≥2
where [S, ¯S] for the set of all edges with exactly one end in S. We called such
a function h a fractional Hamiltonian cycle. For example, Petersen’s graph is
fractionally Hamiltonian , but is not Hamiltonian. Now we give some results on
this topic.
Theorem 3.1. [7] Let h be a fractional Hamiltonian cycle for a graph G and
let x be any vertex of G. Then

e∋x
h(e) = 2.
Theorem 3.2. [7] If G is fractionally Hamiltonian , then G has a fractional
1-factor.
From Theorem 3.2 and Theorem 2.5 we obtain the following result.
Theorem 3.3. [20] If G is fractionally Hamiltonian and |V (G)| ≥3 , then
I(G) ≥1.

Now we give a linear programming for the fractional Hamiltonicity of a graph.
Let G be a graph. We consider h(e) to be the “weight” of edge e, which we also
denote we. Consider the following Linear programming which is called FHLP.
FHLP :
min

e∈E(G)
we
subject
to

e∈[S, ¯S]
we ≥2
for all
S, ∅⊂S ⊂V (G)
we ≥0,
for all e ∈E(G)
We have the following theorem which shows the relationship between the graph
theory and programming.
Theorem 3.4. [20] Let G be a graph on at least 3 vertices. Then G is fractional
Hamiltonian if and only if the value of the FHLP is exactly |V (G)|.
We have know that the best known necessary condition for a graph G to be
Hamiltonian is t(G) ≥1. This fact is true for fractional Hamiltonicity.
Theorem 3.5. [4] If graph G is fractional Hamiltonian, then t(G) ≥1.
Theorem 3.6. [4] Let t < 3
2. Then there is a graph G with t(G) ≥t that is not
fractional Hamiltonian.
Note that there is a graph G with t(G) ≥2 that is not Hamiltonian. But the
following conjecture was presented in [20].
Conjecture 3.1. If t(G) ≥2, then G is fractional Hamiltonian.
There are many problems on graphs which are fractional Hamiltonian can be
considered. For example, we can consider the structures and properties of frac-
tional Hamiltonian graphs.
Problem 3.1. Find the necessary and suﬃcient conditions for a graph to be
fractional Hamiltonian.
Problem 3.2. Find the relationship between the binding number and fractional
Hamiltonian graphs.
The decision problem of determining whether a graph is Hamiltonian is NP-
complete. But the fractional Hamiltonicity can be tested in polynomial time.
We can solve this problem using linear programming.

number in [0, 1] so that, for each vertex x of G we have g(x) ≤dh
G(x) ≤f(x). If
g(x) = f(x) for all x ∈V (G), then a fractional (g, f)-factor is called a fractional
f-factor. Let a and b be two non-negative integers. If g(x) = a and f(x) = b
for every x ∈V (G), then a fractional (g, f)-factor is called a fractional [a, b]-
factor. If a = b = k, a fractional [a, b]-factor is called a fractional k-factor. A
fractional [0, 1]-factor is also called a fractional matching. At ﬁrst we introduce
the following main theorem which was ﬁrst given by Astee in [2] and for which
the author gave a new proof in [10].
Theorem 4.1 (Fractional Lov´asz’s Theorem). [10] A graph G has a frac-
tional (g, f)-factor if and only if for any subset S of V (G)
g(T ) −dG−S(T ) ≤f(S)
where T = {x : x ∈V (G) \ S, dG−S(x) ≤g(x)}.
Recently Liu, Zhang and Ma studied the properties of fractional (g, f)-factors
and the relationship between isolated toughness and fractional factors of graphs.
The following theorems were obtained.
Theorem 4.2. [26] A graph G has a fractional k-factor if and only if for any
subset S of V (G)
k−1

j=0
(k −j)pj(G −S) ≤k|S|
where pj(G −S) denotes the number of vertices in G −S with degree j.
Theorem 4.3. [10] Let G be a bipartite graph or g(x) ̸= f(x) for all x ∈V (G).
Then G has a fractional (g, f)-factor if and only if G has a (g, f)-factor.
Theorem 4.4. [22] Let G ba a graph. If for every pair of vertices x , y of G,
g(y)dG(x) ≤f(x)dG(y),
then G has a fractional (g, f)-factor.
Theorem 4.5. [10] There are polynomial algorithms for ﬁnding a fractional
(g, f)-factor and a maximum fractional (g, f)-factor in graphs.
Theorem 4.6. [15, 18] Let G be a connected graph and k > 0 be an integer. If
δ(G) ≥k and I(G) ≥k, then G has a fractional k-factor.
Theorem 4.7. [18] Let G be a graph and let a and b be two integers such that
a ≤b. If I(G) ≥a−1+ a
b and δ(G) ≥I(G), then G has a fractional [a, b]-factor.
Theorem 4.8. [25] Let G be a graph with |V (G)| ≥k + 1 where k ≥2. Then G
has a fractional k-factor if t(G) ≥k −1
k.
Theorem 4.9. [25] If graph G has a fractional (g, f)-factor, then G has a fac-
tional (g, f)-factor h such that h(e) ∈{0, 1, 1
2}.

G. Liu
Other results on fractional factors can be found in [5, 11, 22]. In the following
we give some conjectures and problems. Conjecture 4.2 improves the results in
Theorem 4.6, Theorem 4.7 and Theorem 4.8.
Conjecture 4.1. Let G be a graph. If t(G) ≥k, then G has a connected frac-
tional k-factor where k ≥2.
Conjecture 4.2. Let G be a graph and let a and b be two integers such that
a ≤b. If I(G) ≥a −1 + a−1
b , then G has a fractional [a, b]-factor.
Problem 4.1. Find the relationship between fractional factors and the factors
in graphs.
Problem 4.2. Find the relationship between fractional factors and the binding
number of a graph.
Problem 4.3. Find the suﬃcient conditions for a graph to have connected frac-
tional factors.
It is not diﬃcult to see that the fractional (g, f)-factor problem can be formulated
as a linear programming and can also be solved in polynomial time. In another
way the polynomial algorithms for solving the problem of fractional (g,f)-factors
by ﬁnding the increasing chains in a graph were given in [10].

The Fractional Covering and Packing of Hypergraphs
In this section we study the fractional covering and packing of hypergraphs. Some
problems on fractional graph theory can be solved as the problems on fractional
covering and packing of hypergraphs. A hypergraph H is a pair (S, X), where S
is a ﬁnite set and X is a family of subsets of S. The set S is called the vertex set
of the hypergraph, and so we sometimes write V (H) for S. The elements of X
are called huperedges or sometimes just edges. A covering of H is a collection of
hyperedges X1, X2, · · · , Xj so that S ⊂X1 ∪X2 ∪· · · Xj. The least j for which
this is possible is called the covering number of H, and is denoted by k(H). The
covering problem can be formulated as an integer program (IP). To each set
Xi ∈X associate a 0, 1-variable xi. The vector x is an indicator of the sets we
have selected for the cover. Let M be the vertex-hyperedge incidence matrix of
H. The condition that the indicator vector x corresponds to a covering is simply
Mx ≥1 ( that is, every coordinate of Mx is at least 1). Thus k(H) is the value
of the integer program minimize I′x subject to Mx ≥1 and x ≥0 where I
represents a vector of all ones.
A packing of a hypergraph H is a subset Y ⊂S with the property that no
two elements of Y are together in the same member of X. The packing number
p(H) is deﬁned to be the largest size of a packing. The packing number of a
graph is its independence number. There is a corresponding IP formulation. Let
yi be a 0, 1-indicator variable that is 1 just when si ∈Y. The condition that Y
is a packing is simply M ′y ≤1 where M is as above. Thus p(H) is the value of
the integer program maximize I′y subject to M ′y ≤1 and y ≥0.
This is the dual IP to the covering problem and the following result is true.

Some Results on Fractional Graph Theory
115
Theorem 5.1. [20] For a hypergraph H, we have p(H) ≤k(H).
Note that many graph theory concepts can be seen as hypergraph covering or
packing problems. For instance, the chromatic number and matching number.
Now we consider fractional covering and packing.
We deﬁne the fractional covering number and fractional packing number of
H, denoted kf(H) and pf(H), respectively, to be the values of the dual linear
program “ minimize I′x subject to Mx ≥1 and x ≥0” and “maximize I′y
subject to M ′y ≤1 and y ≥0.” By duality we have kf(H) = pf(H). There is
a second way to deﬁne the fractional covering and packing numbers. We begin
by deﬁne t-fold covering and t-fold covering number of H where t is a positive
integer. A t-fold covering of H is a multiset {X1, X2, · · · , Xj} where Xi ∈X with
the property that each s ∈S is in at least t of the X′
is. The smallest cardinality
(least j) of such multiset is called the t-fold covering number of H and denoted
by kt(H). Clearly, k1(H) = k(H). Note that ks+t(H) ≤ks(H)+kt(H). Therefore
we deﬁne the fractional covering number of H to be
kf(H) = lim
t−→∞
kt(H)
t
= inf
t
kt(H)
t
.
We can prove that the above two deﬁnitions are the same and kf(H) ≤k(H).
In the same way, we deﬁne a t-fold packing of H to be a multiset Y of the
vertex set with the property that for every Xi ∈X we have 
s∈X m(s) ≤t
where m is the multiplicity of s ∈S in Y. The t-fold packing number of H,
denoted by pt(H), is the largest cardinality of a t-fold packing. Observe that
p1(H) = p(H). We deﬁne the fractional packing number of H to be
pf(H) = lim
t−→∞
pt(H)
t
.
We also have pf(H) ≥p(H). It is easy to see that the following result holds.
Theorem 5.2. [20] If H has no exposed vertices, then kf(H) is a rational num-
ber and there exists a positive integer s for which kf(H) = ks(H)/s.

Fractional Coloring Problems
The fractional chromatic number of a graph is deﬁned as follows. A b-fold coloring
of a graph G assigns to each vertex of G a set of b colors so that adjacent vertices
receive disjoint sets of colors. We say that G is a : b-colorable if it has a b-fold
coloring in which the colors are drawn from a palette of a colors. We also call
this coloring an a : b-coloring. The least a for which G has a b-fold coloring is
the b-fold coloring number of G, denoted χb(G). Note that χ1(G) = χ(G), where
χ(G) is the chromatic number of G. Thus the fractional chromatic number to be
χf(G) =
lim
b−→∞
χb(G)

On the other hand we can describe the fractional chromatic number as follows.
Given graph G, we construct a hypergraph H such that the vertex set of H is
the vertex set of G and the hyperedges of H are the independent sets of G. Then
it ia easy to see that k(H) = χ(G), χf(G) = kf(G) and χf(G) ≤χ(G). It is
easy to see that the following results hold.
Theorem 6.1. For any graph G, χf(G) ≥|V (G)|/α(G), where α(G) is the
independent number of G.
Theorem 6.2. Let C2m+1 be a cycle with 2m + 1 vertices. Then χf(G) = 2 +
(1/m).
In an a : b-coloring of a graph, we assign a set of b colors to each vertex, with
adjacent vertices receiving disjoint color sets; the colors are selected from a
master palette of a colors. We say a graph G is a : b-choosable if for every a-
palette P of G we can assign to each vertex v of G a b-set of colors C(v) ⊆P(v)
so that C(v) ∩C(w) = ∅when v is adjacent to w. The b-fold list chromatic
number of G, denoted χl
b(G), is the least a so that G is a : b-choosable. We
deﬁne the fractional list chromatic number of G to be
χ′
f(G) =
lim
b−→∞
χl
b(G)
b
= inf
b
χl
b(G)
b
.
Note that if a graph is a : b-choosable, then it must be a : b-colorable. Thus
χf(G) =
lim
b−→∞
χb
b ≤lim
b−→∞
χl
b
b = χl
b(G).
Theorem 6.3. [20] The fractional chromatic number of a graph equals its frac-
tional list number.
Similarly, we can deﬁne the fractional edge coloring of a graph. we can de-
scribe the fractional edge chromatic number χ′
f(G) as follows. Given graph G,
we construct a hypergraph H such that the vertex set of H is the edge set of
G and the hyperedges of H are the matchings of G. Then it is easy to see that
χ′
f(G) = kf(G). and χ′
f(G) ≤χ′(G) where χ′(G) is the edge chromatic number
of G. Let H be any induced subgraph of G such that |V (H)| is odd and at lest
3. we deﬁne
Λ(G) = max
H
2|E(G)|
|V (H)| −1.
The main result on fractional edge colorings is the following result the proof of
which is very diﬃcult.
Theorem 6.4. [20] For any loopless multigraph G,
χ′
f(G) = max{Δ(G), Λ(G)}
where Δ(G) is the maximum degree of G.

Some Results on Fractional Graph Theory
117
Now we present some open problems.
Problem 6.1. When we have χf(G) = χ(G) and χ′
f(G) = χ′(G)?
Problem 6.2. Given graph G how to ﬁnd χf(G) and χ′
f(G)?
A graph G is called fractional vertex-critical if for any edge e of G, χf(G) <
χf(G−e) and called fractional edge-critical if for any edge e χ′
f(G) < χ′
f(G−e).
Problem 6.3. Find the properties of factional vertex-critical graphs and frac-
tional edge-critical graphs.
Note that computing χ′
f can be done in polynomial time. But computing χf can
not be done in polynomial time although the linear program can be solve by
polynomial time. This is because of the linear program may has exponentially
many (in the number of vertices) variables. One for each maximal independent
set in the graph. Some other new results on fractional factors and colors can be
found in [5, 11, 24, 25].

Abstract. Spherical triangle in the n-dimensional unit sphere Sn is clas-
siﬁed into seven types according to side and angle. In this paper, we con-
sider random spherical triangles in Sn, and calculate the probabilities of
seven types to which random spherical triangles belong. Each probabil-
ity monotone converges to a certain value as the dimension n tends to
inﬁnity. As an application, we can estimate the expectation of numbers
of division on acute triangulation of a random spherical triangle in S2.

Introduction
In Euclidean geometry, triangle is roughly classiﬁed into two types with respect
to angle: acute triangles and obtuse triangles. On the other hand, in spherical
geometry, there are several varieties of spherical triangle, because a spherical
triangle △ABC on the unit sphere centered at O has six angles: three vertex
angles ̸ A, ̸ B and ̸ C and three arc angles (sides) ̸ AOB(= AB = c), ̸ BOC(=
BC = a) and ̸ COA(= CA = b).
In this paper, we show that there are seven types of spherical triangle in the
n-dimensional unit sphere according to whether three sides and three angles are
acute or obtuse. Three random points in Sn determine a spherical triangle by
connecting these points as the minor arcs. We calculate the probabilities of seven
types to which random spherical triangles belong as in Table 1. As the dimension
n of the unit sphere increases, each probability monotone converges to a certain
limit value. This simple phenomenon is geometrically understood by considering
a small perturbation of right regular spherical triangle.
This paper is made up of four sections. In Section 2, we give a classiﬁcation of
possible spherical triangles in seven types according to side and angle. Section 3
gives the probabilities of seven types, and the asymptotic behavior is studied as
the dimension of the sphere tends to inﬁnity in Section 4. We ﬁnally provide an
application for acute triangulations of triangles on the sphere in Section 5.

sides and one obtuse side. In the same way, we denote by Ac.(resp. Ob.) that

the vertex angle is less(resp. more) than π/2, for example, by 3Ac.(=0Ob.) the
spherical triangle with three acute vertex angles. In the following argument, we
only consider spherical triangle in Sn(n ≥2) such that its three sides and three
angles are not 0, π/2 nor π. This exception has no inﬂuence on the probabilities
of random spherical triangle.
Theorem 1. Spherical triangle in Sn(n ≥2) is classiﬁed into the following
seven types:
I(3ac. 3Ac.), II(3ac., 2Ac.), III(2ac., 2Ac.), IV(1ac., 2Ac.),
V(1ac.,1Ac.), VI(1ac., 0Ac.), VII(0ac., 0Ac.)
as in Table 2.
Proof. As for n ≥3, spherical triangle △ABC in Sn can be reduced to that in
S2 by considering the 2-subsphere spanned by the three points A, B, and C. In
this way, let us consider spherical triangle in S2. The important tool to solve
this problem is the spherical trigonometry, especially, the following two laws of
cosines for sides and angles (e.g., [1],p286, [3],p54 and p59):
cos a = cos b cos c + sin b sin c cos A,
(1)
cos A = −cos B cos C + sin B sin C cos a.
Since the signs of sin b, sin c, sin B and sin C are all positive,
sign(cosA) = sign(cosa −cos b cosc),
(2)
sign(cosa) = sign(cosA + cos B cos C).

From (3), 3Ac. implies 3ac., so the possibilities of (2ac., 3Ac.), (1ac., 3Ac.)
and (0ac., 3Ac.) are denied. In the similar way, from (2), 3ob.(=0ac.) implies
3Ob.(=0Ac.), so the possibilities of (0ac., 2Ac.) and (0ac., 1Ac.) are denied. In
addition, from (3), (A, B, C)=(Ac., Ob., Ob.) implies (a, b, c)=(ac., ob., ob.),
hence the possibilities of (3ac., 1Ac.) and (2ac., 1Ac.) are denied. In the similar
way, from (2), (a, b, c)=(ac., ac., ob.) implies (A, B, C)=(Ac., Ac., Ob.), hence
the possibility of (2ac., 0Ac.) is denied. Finally, we will show that the possibility
of (3ac., 0Ac.) is also denied. The condition 3ac. implies that △ABC is inside of
a right regular triangle with the area π/2. However, 0Ac.(=3Ob.) implies that
the area of △ABC is greater than π/2. It is a contradiction. We have thus proved
the theorem.

Probabilities of Seven Types
In this section, we will calculate probabilities of these seven types to which
random spherical triangles belong. Without loss of generality, assume that points
A = (1, 0, 0, . . ., 0) and B = (cos θ, sin θ, 0, . . . , 0) where θ ∈(0, π) is a random
variable with a certain density function depending on the dimension n.
Figure 1 shows the relation between the third point C and seven types on
the hemisphere of S2. Point A and B are on the equator. According to whether
the arc length AB is acute or obtuse, each hemisphere is divided into several
regions. If point C is in a region, the spherical triangle △ABC belongs to the
label of the region. Note that almost all boundaries of these regions are given
as the intersection of a hyperplane and the sphere. There are a few curves, for
example, the boundary between type I and type II in Figure 1(left), however,
we will calculate the probabilities without considering these curves.
For n ≥3, the divided regions are also composed of the intersection of a
hyperplane and Sn, hence, the argument is parallel to that of S2. Only one
diﬀerence among them is the density function of the arc length between two
random points.
Theorem 2. The probability density function fn(θ) of the arc length θ between
two random points x, y in Sn(n ≥2) is given as
fn(θ) = (sin θ)n−1

Let x = (x0, x1, . . . , xn) be a random point in Sn. First, we will show

Let z0, z1, . . . , zn be independent normal variables with zero mean and unit vari-
ance, i.e., the density function of zi is given by e−z2/2/
√
2π. Then the point
z = (z0, z1, . . . , zn) ∈Rn+1 has the probability density function

(2π)(n+1)/2 e−|z|2/2.
Therefore, the point z/|z| is uniformly distributed on the surface of the unit
sphere Sn. In this way, the random point x = (x0, x1, . . . , xn) is realized as
z/|z|, i.e.,
xi =

Two random variables z2

n are independent and have the χ2
distributions with degree of freedom 1 and n, respectively. Now recall the fact
that if X and Y are independent random variables having the χ2 distributions
with degrees of freedom a and b, then the random variable X/(X + Y ) has the
beta distribution Beta(a/2, b/2)(see, e.g., [4], p.64 and [5], p.187). Using this
fact, x2
0 has the distribution Beta(1/2, n/2).
Now we can calculate the distribution function Fn(θ) of fn(θ). We can assume
that y = (1, 0, . . . , 0) and x = (x0, x1, . . . , xn). If 0 ≤θ ≤π/2,
Fn(θ) = Pr(xy ≤θ) = 1

Limit Values of Seven Types
In this section, we will investigate the asymptotic behavior of seven probabilities
as the dimension n tends to inﬁnity.
Theorem 4. The seven probabilities monotone converge as the dimension n of
Sn tends to inﬁnity, and the limit values are given as the follows:
Pr(I) ↗1/8,
Pr(II) ↘0,
Pr(III) ↗3/8,
Pr(IV) ↘0,
Pr(V) ↗3/8,

Remark 3. Let us explain these limit values from the geometrical point of view.
The more the dimension n increases, the more the density function fn(θ)(0 ≤
θ ≤π) concentrates on π/2. Therefore, we can assume that random spherical
triangle is almost a regular right triangle. Three sides a, b and c are nearly equal
to π/2, i.e., a = π/2 + εa, b = π/2 + εb, c = π/2 + εc where εa, εb and εc are
inﬁnitesimally small. In the same way, three vertex angles A, B and C are nearly
equal to π/2, i.e., A = π/2 + εA, B = π/2 + εB, C = π/2 + εC where εA, εB and
εC are also inﬁnitesimally small. Applying these values to the spherical cosine
law for sides (1),
−sin εa = sin εb sin εc −cos εb cos εc sin εA,
hence we get sin εa sin εA > 0, i.e., the signs of εa and εA are the same. This fact
implies that for suﬃciently large dimension, random spherical triangle tends to
belong to the types I, III, V and VII. Assuming that the signs of εa, εb and εc
are random and independent, we can get the desired result.

Acute Triangulation of a Random Spherical Triangle
In [2], Itoh and Zamﬁrescu studied acute triangulations of spherical triangles.
They classiﬁed the spherical triangles into the following three types.
(i) At most one edge length is larger than π/2 and precisely one angle is obtuse
or right.
(ii) No angle is obtuse, or all 3 edge lengths are larger than π/2, or precisely 2
edges have lengths larger than π/2 and both opposite angles are obtuse or right.
(iii) Precisely two edges have lengths larger than π/2 and one of the opposite
angles is acute.
In Case (i), every non-acute spherical triangle can be triangulated with 7 acute
triangles. And in Cases (ii) and (iii), any spherical triangle is triangulable with
at most 10 acute triangles. Using this result, we can estimate the upper bound
of the expectation of the number of acute triangles in acute triangulation. Case
(i) corresponds to Types II and III in our classiﬁcation. Case (iii) corresponds
to Type IV, and other types belong to Case (ii). Of course, triangles in Type I
is acute, hence,

Abstract. A (3, 2)-track layout of a graph G consists of a 2-track as-
signment of G and an edge 3-coloring of G with no monochromatic
X-crossing. This paper studies the problem of (3, 2)-track layout of bi-
partite graph subdivisions. Recently Dujmovi´c and Wood showed that
every graph G with n vertices has a (3, 2)-track subdivision of G with
4⌈log qn(G)⌉+ 3 division vertices per edge, where qn(G) is the queue
number of G. This paper improves their result for the case of complete
bipartite graphs, and shows that every complete bipartite graph Km,n
has a (3, 2)-track subdivision of Km,n with 2⌈log qn(Km,n)⌉+ 1 division
vertices per edge, where m and n are numbers of vertices of the partite
sets of Km,n with m ≥n.

Introduction
A graph Gm,n is a bipartite graph having partite sets A with m vertices and B
with n vertices if V (G) = A ∪B, A ∩B = φ and each edge joins a vertex of A
to a vertex of B. A bipartite graph Gm,nis complete if Gm,n contains all edges
joining vertices in distinct sets. A complete bipartite graph is denoted by Km,n.
An ordering of a set S is a total order <σ on S. It will be convenient to
interchange “σ” and <σ when there is no ambiguity. A vertex ordering of a
graph G is an ordering σ of the vertex set V (G).
A vertex t-coloring of a graph G is a partition {V1, V2} of V (G) such that for
every edge vw ∈E(G), if v ∈Vi and w ∈Vj then i ̸= j. Suppose that each color
class Vi is ordered by <i. Then the ordered set (Vi, <i) is called a track, and
{(V1, <1), (V2, <2)} is called a 2-track assignment of G.
An X-crossing in a track assignment consists of two edges vw and xy such
that v <i x and y <j w, for distinct colors i and j. An edge 3-coloring of
G is simply a partition {E1, E2, E3} of E(G). An edge vw ∈Ei is said to be
colored i. A (3, 2)-track layout of G consists of a 2-track assignment of G and
an edge 3-coloring of G with no monochromatic X-crossing. A graph admitting
a (3, 2)-track layout is called a (3, 2)-track graph. Track layouts were introduced
by Dujmovi´c, Morin, and Wood [1].
If e = uv is an edge of G, then e is subdivided when it is replaced by the edges
uw and wv. We call the new vertex w the division vertex. If every edge of G is

subdivided, the resulting graph is the subdivision graph. Note that a graph is
also considered to be a subdivision of itself.
This paper studies (3,2)-track layouts of graph subdivisions. Recently Duj-
movi´c and Wood [2] showed the following proposition:
Proposition 1. (Dujmovi´c and Wood [2]) Every graph G with n vertices has
a (3, 2)-track subdivision of G with 4⌈log qn(G)⌉+ 3 division vertices per edge,
where qn(G) is the queue number of G.
The deﬁnition of the queue number is as follows. In a vertex ordering σ of a
graph G, let L(e) and R(e) denote the endpoints of each edge e ∈E(G) such
that L(e) <σ R(e). Consider two edges e, f ∈E(G) with no common endpoint
such that L(e) <σ L(f). If L(e) <σ L(f) <σ R(f) <σ R(e) then e and f nest.
A queue is a set of edges E ⊂E(G) such that no two edges in E nest. For an
integer d > 0, a d-queue layout of G consists of a vertex ordering σ of G and
a partition {Eℓ: 1 ≤ℓ≤d} of E(G), such that each Eℓis a queue in σ. The
queue number qn(G) of a graph G is the minimum d such that there is a d-queue
layout of G. As for queue layout, see [3,4] etc. There is a summary of bounds on
the queue number for various kinds of graph family in [5].
As for Proposition 1, Dujmovi´c and Wood [2] also showed that the order of the
number of division vertices is optimal. Thus, to ﬁnd a track layout with fewer
tracks, edge-colorings and division vertices for various kinds of graph family
become an interesting problem.
This paper deals with the number of division vertices of bipartite graphs and
shows the following theorem:
Theorem 1. Every bipartite graph Gm,n has a (3, 2)-track subdivision with 2
⌈log n⌉−1 division vertices per edge, where m ≥n.
For the queue number of a complete bipartite graph Km,n, L. S. Heath and
A. L. Rosenberg [4] showed the following proposition:
Proposition 2. (L. S. Heath and A. L. Rosenberg [4])
qn(Km,n) = min (⌈m/2⌉, ⌈n/2⌉).
Applying Proposition 2 to Theorem 1, we have the following Theorem:
Theorem 2. Every complete bipartite graph Km,n (m ≥n) has a (3, 2)-track
subdivision with
2⌈log qn(Km,n)⌉+ 1
division vertices per edge.
This Theorem 2 improves the Dujmovi´c and Wood’s result (Proposition 1) for
the case of complete bipartite graphs. The proof of Theorem 1 is similar to that
of their result [2], however, it becomes simpler by capitalizing the character of
bipartite graphs.

Proof of Theorem 2
First, we deﬁne a breadth-ﬁrst ordering of number-string sets.
Let S = {0, 1} be the binary alphabet and S∗the set of all strings over S. If
s ∈S∗has length k (k > 0), then write s = s1s2 . . . sk where si is the character of
s in position i. Order the elements of S by 0 < 1. Deﬁne a breadth-ﬁrst ordering
<∗on S∗as follows: Suppose s, t ∈S∗.
1. If s is shorter than t, then s <∗t.
2. Suppose s and t have the length k. If i is the ﬁrst position where s and t
diﬀer and si < ti, then s <∗t.
For a number n (n > 1), deﬁne k = ⌈log n⌉. A number s (0 ≤s ≤n −1) has
a unique representation as a string in Sk using the binary representation, where
Sk is the set of all elements of length k. For a number s, use the representation
s1 . . . sk for its binary representation, where s1 is the highest-order digit. For a
string s = s1 . . . sk in Sk let s(i) be the string consisting of the ﬁrst i letters of
s, that is, s(i) = s1 . . . si and s(0) be the empty string ϵ.
Next, we will construct a (3, 2)-track layout of Gm,n (m ≥n) with 2⌈log n⌉−1
division vertices per edge.
Deﬁne k = ⌈log n⌉. Consider a subdivision G∗
m,n of Gm,n made by subdividing
each edge
(as, bt) ∈E(Gm,n)
(as ∈A, bt ∈B, 0 ≤s < m, 0 ≤t < n)
by adding vertices labeled as follows:
V (G∗
m,n) = V1 ∪V2,
V1 = {(as, bt; i)|(as, bt) ∈E(Gm,n), 0 ≤i ≤k, 0 ≤s < m, 0 ≤t < n},
V2 = {(as, bt; i −1, i)|(as, bt) ∈E(Gm,n), 0 < i ≤k, 0 ≤s < m, 0 ≤t < n},
where (as, bt; 0) is identiﬁed with as and (as, bt; k) is identiﬁed with bt.
We will construct a (3, 2)-track layout of G∗
m,n; ﬁrst we deﬁne the vertex
orderings σ of V1 and π of V2, respectively. Then add 3 numbers, 0, 1, 2 to edges
of G∗
m,n so that there is no monochromatic X-crossing.
Theorem 3. There exists a (3, 2)-track layout of the subdivision G∗
m,n of a bi-
partite graph Gm,n.
Proof. First, we deﬁne the vertex ordering σ of V1. Two division vertices (as, bt; i),
(ap, bq; j) ∈V1 are ordered (as, bt; i) <σ (ap, bq; j) if one of the following three
conditions holds:
1. t(i) <∗q(j).
2. t(i) = q(j) and s < p.
3. t(i) = q(j) and s = p, t < q.

For example, if we consider a complete bipartite graph K4,4 (i.e., m = n = 4),
the vertex ordering σ of K4,4 is as follows:
a00, a01, a10, a11, (a00, b00; 1), (a00, b01; 1), (a01, b00; 1), (a01, b01; 1),
(a10, b00; 1), (a10, b01; 1), (a11, b00; 1), (a11, b01; 1),
(a00, b10; 1), (a00, b11; 1), (a01, b10; 1), (a01, b11; 1),
(a10, b10; 1), (a10, b11; 1), (a11, b10; 1), (a11, b11; 1), b00, b01, b10, b11.
Next, we deﬁne the vertex ordering π of V2. Two division vertices (as, bt; i −
1, i), (ap, bq; j −1, j) ∈V2 are ordered (as, bt; i −1, i) <π (ap, bq; j −1, j) if one
of the following two conditions holds:
1. (as, bt; i −1) <σ (ap, bq; j −1).
2. (as, bt; i −1) = (ap, bq; j −1) and (as, bt; i) <σ (ap, bq; j).
Note that both σ and π are total orderings. As for the adjacency relations
of vertices in V (G∗
m,n), connect (as, bt; i −1) and (as, bt; i −1, i) and connect
(as, bt; i −1, i) and (as, bt; i) (0 < i ≤k) if there is the edge asbt ∈E(Gm,n).
Next, we deﬁne the color of each division edges of G∗
m,n as follows: Edges
E1 = {((as, bt; i −1), (as, bt; i −1, i)) : 0 < i ≤k}
are colored 2. Edges
E2 = {((as, bt; i −1, i), (as, bt; i)) : 0 < i ≤k}
are colored ti.
Finally, we show that this track layout is legal, i.e., no two edges in this track
assignment {(V1, <σ), (V2, <π)} form monochromatic X-crossing.
First, consider two edges
((as, bt; i−1), (as, bt; i−1, i)), ((ap, bq; j−1), (ap, bq; j−1, j)) ∈E1
(0 < i, j ≤k).
Although they receive the same color 2, these two edges don’t cross each other
because of the deﬁnition of the vertex ordering π of V2.
Next, consider two edges
((as, bt; i −1), (as, bt; i −1, i)) ∈E1
and
((ap, bq; j −1, j), (ap, bq; j)) ∈E2
(0 < i, j ≤k). The edge ((as, bt; i −1), (as, bt; i −1, i)) receives color 2 while the
edge ((ap, bq; j −1, j), (ap, bq; j)) receives the color 0 or 1. Thus they don’t form
monochromatic X-crossing.
Finally consider two edges
((as, bt; i −1, i), (as, bt; i)), ((ap, bq; j −1, j), (ap, bq; j)) ∈E2
(0 < i, j ≤k).
Let the two edges form X-crossing. We may assume that the endpoints of the two
edges are laid out in the order (as, bt; i−1, i) <π (ap, bq; j−1, j) and (ap, bq; j) <σ
(as, bt; i). We want to show that the two division edges receive diﬀerent color.

(3,2)-Track Layout of Bipartite Graph Subdivisions
131
By the above assumption and the deﬁnition of the division vertex ordering, we
have t(i−1) ≤∗q(j −1) <∗q(j) ≤∗t(i). From the deﬁnition of the breadth-ﬁrst
ordering, this inequality holds only when i = j.
Suppose t(i −1) <∗q(i −1), then by the deﬁnition of the division vertex
ordering we have t(i) <∗q(i) which contradicts the assumption. Thus we have
t(i −1) = q(i −1) and q(i) ≤∗t(i).
Suppose q(i) = t(i) then, by the deﬁnition of vertex ordering, we have (as, bt; i)
<σ (ap, bq; j) which contradicts the assumption. Therefore t(i−1) = q(i−1) and
qi < ti. In this case, qi = 0 and ti = 1, thus the two edges have diﬀerent colors.
Thus we have proved that this track layout is leagal.
In the proof of Theorem 3, each edge (as, bt) of Gm,n is divided by adding 2k −1
division vertices in the subdivision G∗
m,n, where k = ⌈log n⌉. Thus, we have
Theorem 1.

Conclusion
This paper improves the Dujmovi´c and Wood’s result in [2] for the case of
complete bipartite graphs Km,n having two partite sets with m and n vertices
respectively (m ≥n) and shows that Km,n has a (3, 2)-track subdivision with
2⌈log qn(Km,n)⌉+1 division vertices per edge. We don’t know whether this result
is best possible or not. To ﬁnd better track layout for complete bipartite graphs
is still an interesting problem.

Abstract. In this paper, we consider branched (di)graph coverings or
graphs with semi-free action. A (di)graph with semi-free action of a group
Γ is a (di)graph such that a sub(di)graph is ﬁxed by Γ while its com-
plement carries a free action. A branched regular covering of a (di)graph
is a (di)graph, where vertices are either regular (free orbits) or totally
ramiﬁed (ﬁxed vertices). Deng, Sato and Wu treated the characteristic
polynomial of a branched covering of digraph, where a subdigraph is an
irregular covering of some digraph and its complement is totally ramiﬁed.
We give a decompostion formula for the Bartholdi zeta function of a
branched covering of a digraph D which treated by Deng, Sato and Wu.
As a corollary, we obtain a decomposition formula for the Bartholdi zeta
function of a graph having a semi-free action.

Introduction
Graphs and digraphs treated here are ﬁnite. Let G = (V (G), E(G)) be a con-
nected graph (possibly multiple edges and loops) with the set V (G) of ver-
tices and the set E(G) of unoriented edges uv joining two vertices u and v.
For uv ∈E(G), an arc (u, v) is the oriented edge from u to v. Set D(G) =
{(u, v), (v, u) | uv ∈E(G)}. For e = (u, v) ∈D(G), set u = o(e) and v = t(e).
Furthermore, let e−1 = (v, u) be the inverse of e = (u, v).
A path P of length n in G is a sequence P = (e1, . . . , en) of n arcs such
that ei ∈D(G), t(ei) = o(ei+1)(1 ≤i ≤n −1). Set | P |= n, o(P) = o(e1)
and t(P) = t(en). Also, P is called a (o(P), t(P))-path. We say that a path
P = (e1, . . . , en) has a backtracking (or a bump at t(ei) ) if e−1
i+1 = ei for some
i(1 ≤i ≤n −1). A (v, w)-path is called a v-cycle (or v-closed path) if v = w.
The inverse cycle of a cycle C = (e1, . . . , en) is the cycle C−1 = (e−1
n , . . . , e−1
1 ).
We introduce an equivalence relation between cycles. Such two cycles C1 =
(e1, . . . , em) and C2 = (f1, . . . , fm) are called equivalent if there exists k such
that fj = ej+k for all j, where indices are treated mod n. The inverse cycle
of C is in general not equivalent to C. Let [C] be the equivalence class which
contains a cycle C. Let Br be the cycle obtained by going r times around a cycle
B. Such a cycle is called a power of B. A cycle C is reduced if both C and C2
have no backtracking. Furthermore, a cycle C is prime if it is not a power of a
strictly smaller cycle. Note that each equivalence class of prime, reduced cycles

Bartholdi Zeta Functions of Branched Coverings of Digraphs

of a graph G corresponds to a unique conjugacy class of the fundamental group
π1(G, v) of G at a vertex v of G.
The (Ihara) zeta function of a graph G is deﬁned to be a function of u ∈C
with | u | suﬃciently small, by Z(G, u) = ZG(u) = 
[C](1 −u|C|)−1, where [C]
runs over all equivalence classes of prime, reduced cycles of G(see [8]).
Zeta functions of graphs started from zeta functions of regular graphs by
Ihara [8]. In [8], he showed that their reciprocals are explicit polynomials. A
zeta function of a regular graph G associated with a unitary representation of
the fundamental group of G was developed by Sunada [17,18]. Hashimoto [7]
treated multivariable zeta functions of bipartite graphs. Bass [2] generalized
Ihara’s result on the zeta function of a regular graph to an irregular graph, and
showed that its reciprocal is again a polynomial.
Theorem 1 (Bass). Let G be a connected graph. Then the reciprocal of the
zeta function of G is given by
Z(G, u)−1 = (1 −u2)r−1 det(I −uA(G) + u2(D −I)),
where r and A(G) are the Betti number and the adjacency matrix of G, respec-
tively, and D = DG = (dij) is the diagonal matrix with dii = deg Gvi where
V (G) = {v1, . . . , vn}.
Stark and Terras [16] gave an elementary proof of Theorem 1, and discussed
three diﬀerent zeta functions of any graph. Furthermore, various proofs of Bass’s
Theorem were given by Foata and Zeilberger [5], Kotani and Sunada [10].
Mizuno and Sato [11] gave a determinant expression for the zeta function of
a regular covering of a graph.
Let G be a connected graph. Then the cyclic bump count cbc(π) of a cycle
π = (π1, . . . , πn) is cbc(π) =| {i = 1, . . . , n | πi = π−1
i+1} |, where πn+1 = π1.
Then the Bartholdi zeta function of G is deﬁned to be a function of u, t ∈C with
| u |, | t | suﬃciently small, by ζG(u, t) = ζ(G, u, t) = 
[C](1 −ucbc(C)t|C|)−1,
where [C] runs over all equivalence classes of prime cycles of G(see [1]). If u = 0,
then the Bartholdi zeta function of G is the (Ihara) zeta function of G.
Bartholdi [1] gave a determinant expression of the Bartholdi zeta function of
a graph.
Theorem 2 (Bartholdi). Let G be a connected graph with n vertices and m un-
oriented edges. Then the reciprocal of the Bartholdi zeta function of G is given by
ζ(G, u, t)−1 = (1 −(1 −u)2t2)m−n det(I −tA(G) + (1 −u)(D −(1 −u)I)t2).
In the case of u = 0, Theorem 2 implies Theorem 1.

Let D be a connected simple digraph with n vertices and m arcs which is not a

Then the Bartholdi zeta function of D is deﬁned to be a function of u, t ∈C with
| u |, | t | suﬃciently small, by ζD(u, t) = ζ(D, u, t) = 
[C](1 −ucbc(C)t|C|)−1,
where [C] runs over all equivalence classes of prime cycles of D. If D is the
symmetric digraph corresponding to a connected graph G, then the Bartholdi
zeta function of D is the Bartholdi zeta function of G.
Let m1 =| {(u, v) ∈A(D) | (v, u) ∈A(D)} | /2. Then we deﬁne an n × n
matrix A1 = A1(D) = (auv) as follows:
auv =
1 if (u, v) and (v, u) ∈A(D),
0 otherwise.
Furthermore, let A0 = A0(D) = A(D) −A1.
Let V (D) = {v1, . . . , vn}. Then an n × n matrix S = SD = (sij) is the
diagonal matrix deﬁned by sii =| {(vi, vj) ∈A(D) | (vj, vi) ∈A(D)} |. Note
that n
i=1 sii = 2m1. Set sD(vi) = sii, 1 ≤i ≤n.
Two m × m matrices B = (bef)e,f∈A(D) and J = (tef)e,f∈A(D) are deﬁned as
follows:
bef =
1 if t(e) = o(f),
0 otherwise
, tef =
1 if f = e−1,
0 otherwise.
Mizuno and Sato [13] presented a decomposition formula for the Bartholdi
zeta function of a digraph which is not symmetric.
Theorem 3 (Mizuno and Sato). Let D be a connected digraph with n vertices
and m arcs which is not symmetric, and m1 the number of pairs of symmetric
arcs. Then the reciprocal of the Bartholdi zeta function of D is
ζ(D, u, t)−1 = det(Im −(B −(1 −u)J)t)
= (1 −(1 −u)2t2)m1−n det(In −tA1 −(1 −(1 −u)2t2)tA0 + (1 −u)t2(S −(1 −u)In)).
If D is the symmetric digraph corresponding to a connected graph G, then
Theorem 3 implies Theorem 2.
Sato [14] introduced a regular covering of a digraph, and presented a decom-
position formula for the Bartholdi zeta function of it.
In Section 2, we introduce a covering of a digraph D and give a character-
ization of it by permutation voltage assignments. In Section 3, we consider a
branched covering of D, and consider its ajacency matrix. In Section 4, we give
a decompostion formula of the Bartholdi zeta function of a branched covering
of D. In Section 5, we obtain a decomposition formula for the Bartholdi zeta
function of a graph having a semi-free action.

The Permutation Voltage Digraph Construction
A graph H is called a covering of a graph G with projection π : H −→G if
there is a surjection π : V (H) −→V (G) such that π|N(v′) : N(v′) −→N(v) is a

Bartholdi Zeta Functions of Branched Coverings of Digraphs
135
bijection for all vertices v ∈V (G) and v′ ∈π−1(v). The projection π : H −→G
is an n-fold covering of G if π is n-to-one. A covering π : H −→G is said to be
regular if there is a subgroup B of the automorphism group Aut H of H acting
freely on H such that the quotient graph H/B is isomorphic to G.
Let G be a graph and Sn the symmetric group on the set N = {1, 2, . . ., n}.
Then a mapping α : D(G) −→Sn is called a permutation voltage assignment if
α(v, u) = α(u, v)−1 for each (u, v) ∈D(G). The pair (G, α) is called a permuta-
tion voltage graph. The derived graph Gα of the permutation voltage graph (G, α)
is deﬁned as follows: V (Gα) = V (G)×N and ((u, h), (v, k)) ∈D(Gα) if and only
if (u, v) ∈D(G) and k = α(u, v)(h). The natural projection πα : Gα −→G is de-
ﬁned by πα(u, h) = u. The graph Gα is called a derived graph covering of G with
voltages in Sn or an n-covering of G. Note that the n-covering Gα is an n-fold
covering of G. Futhermore, every n-fold covering of a graph G is an n-covering
Gα of G for some permutation voltage assignment α : D(G) −→Sn(see [6]).
Let G be a graph and Γ a ﬁnite group. Then a mapping α : D(G) −→Γ
is called an ordinary voltage assignment if α(v, u) = α(u, v)−1 for each (u, v) ∈
D(G). The pair (G, α) is called an ordinary voltage graph. The derived graph Gα
of the ordinary voltage graph (G, α) is deﬁned as follows: V (Gα) = V (G) × Γ
and ((u, h), (v, k)) ∈D(Gα) if and only if (u, v) ∈D(G) and k = hα(u, v). The
natural projection πα : Gα −→G is deﬁned by πα(u, h) = u. The graph Gα is
called a derived graph covering of G with voltages in Γ or a Γ-covering of G.
The natural projection πα commutes with the right multiplication action of the
α(e), e ∈D(G) and the left action of Γ on the ﬁbers: g(u, h) = (u, gh), g ∈Γ,
which is free and transitive. Thus, the Γ-covering Gα is a | Γ |-fold regular
covering of G with covering transformation group Γ. Futhermore, every regular
covering of a graph G is a Γ-covering of G for some group Γ(see [6]).
We can generalize the notion of a covering of a graph to a simple digraph. Let
D be a connected simple digraph. A digraph H is called a covering of D with
projection π : H −→D if there is a surjection π : V (H) −→V (D) such that both
π|N +(v′) : N +(v′) −→N +(v) and π|N −(v′) : N −(v′) −→N −(v) are bijections
for all vertices v ∈V (D) and v′ ∈π−1(v), where N +(v) = N +
D(v) = {w ∈
V (D) | (v, w) ∈A(D)} and N −(v) = N −
D(v) = {w ∈V (D) | (w, v) ∈A(D)},
etc. The projection π : H −→D is an n-fold covering of D if π is n-to-one.
We can generalize the notion of a covering of a graph by a permutation voltage
assignment to a simple digraph. Let D be a connected digraph and Sn the
symmetric group on N = {1, 2, . . ., n}. Let A(D) be the set of arcs in D. Then
a mapping α : A(D) −→Sn is called a pseudo permutation voltage assignment
if α(v, u) = α(u, v)−1 for each (u, v) ∈A(D) such that (v, u) ∈A(D). The pair
(D, α) is called a permutation voltage digraph. The derived digraph Dα of the
permutation voltage digraph (D, α) is deﬁned as follows: V (Dα) = V (D) × N
and ((u, h), (v, k)) ∈A(Dα) if and only if (u, v) ∈A(D) and k = α(u, v)(h). The
digraph Dα is called an n-covering of D. The natural projection πα : Dα −→Sn
is deﬁned by πα(u, h) = u. Note that an n-covering of the symmetric digraph
corresponding to a graph G is an n-covering of G.

Lemma 1. Let D be a connected digraph, Sn the symmetric group on {1, 2, . . . , n}
and α : A(D) −→Sn a pseudo permutation voltage assignment. Then the natural
projection πα : Dα −→D is a covering.
Proof. The proof is straightforward by the deﬁnition of an n-covering and a
covering of D. Q.E.D.
Theorem 4. Let π : ˜D −→D be an n-fold covering of a connected digraph D.
Suppose that the preimage of each symmetric arcs of D is symmetric arcs. Then
there exists a pseudo permutation voltage assignment α : A(D) −→Sn such that
the n-covering Dα is isomrphic to ˜D.
Proof. At ﬁrst, assume that ˜D is connected.
Let u be any vertex of D. Then we label the n vertices in the ﬁbre π−1(u)
in any way as u1, . . . , un. If e = (u, v) is an arc of D, then the ﬁbre π−1(e) is
a family of n arcs which originate at one of the vertices ui and terminate at
one of the verices vi, because the restrictions π|N +(ui) : N +(ui) −→N +(u) and
π|N −(vi) : N −(vi) −→N −(v) of π are bijections.
Let ei be the arc originating at ui and vj = t(ei). Furthermore, let the permta-
tion η of the set {1, . . ., n} be deﬁned by η(i) = j, and let α : A(D) −→Sn be
deﬁned by α(e) = η. Then the labeling of ˜D gives the isomorphism ˜D −→Dα.
By the hypothesis that the preimage of each symmetric arcs of D is symmetric
arcs, we have α(v, u) = α(u, v)−1 for each (u, v) ∈A(D) such that (v, u) ∈A(D).
Q.E.D.

Branched Coverings of Digraphs
We can generalize the notion of a branhced covering of a graph to a simple
digraph. Let D be a connected simple digraph. Then a digraph H is called a
branched covering of D with projection π : H −→D if there are a surjection
π : V (H) −→V (D) and a subset B ⊂V (D) such that π|N +(v′) : N +(v′) −→
N +(v) is a bijection and π|N −(v′) : N −(v′) −→N −(v) is a bijection for all
vertices v ∈V (D) −B and v′ ∈π−1(v) (c.f., [6]). Note that π | H−π−1(B) : H −
π−1(B) −→D −B is a covering. The set B is called a branch set. Furthermore,
the set B is called be of index 1 if | π−1(v) |= 1 for any v ∈B. The projection
π : H −→D is an n-fold branched covering of D if π | H−π−1(B) is n-to-one.
Let D be a connected digraph, B ⊂V (D), N = {1, 2, . . ., n} and α : A(D −
B) −→Sn a pseudo permutation voltage assignment. The subdigraph < B >=<
B >D of D induced by B is a digraph with vertex set B and arc set {(u, v) ∈
A(D) | u ∈B, v ∈B}. Let (B, ¯B) = {(u, v) ∈A(D) | u ∈B, v ∈¯B =
V (D) −B}. Then a branched n-covering Dα
B with branch set B of index 1 is
deﬁned as follows: V (Dα
B) = (V (D −B) × N) ∪B and A(Dα
B) = A(< B >D
) ∪{(u, (v, i)) | (u, v) ∈(B, ¯B), i ∈N} ∪{((u, i), v)) | (u, v) ∈( ¯B, B), i ∈N}
∪{(u, i), (v, j))) | (u, v) ∈A(D −B), j = α(u, v)(i)}.
By Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2 in Deng, Sato and Wu [4], the following result holds.

Theorem 5 (Deng, Sato and Wu). Let π : ˜D −→D be an n-fold branched
covering of a connected digraph D which has the branch set B with index 1.
Suppose that the preimage of each symmetric arcs of D is symmetric arcs. Then
there exists a pseudo permutation voltage assignment α : A(D −B) −→Sn such
that the branched n-covering Dα
B is isomrphic to ˜D.
Next, we consider the adjacency matrix of an n-fold branched covering Dα
B of D
with branch set B of index 1, where α : A(D−B) −→Sn is a pseudo permutation
voltage assignment.
Let D1 = D −B, B = {v1, . . . , vm} and V (D −B) = {u1, . . . , uν}. Let

B in
n + 1 blocks: v1, . . . , vm; (u1, 1), . . . , (uν, 1); . . . ; (u1, n), . . . , (uν, n). We consider
the adjacency matrix A(Dα
B) under this order. Then we have

where J = (1 · · · 1) is the 1×n matrix. The Kronecker product A  B of matrices
of A and B is considered as the matrix A having the element aij replaced by
the matrix aijB.
Now, let Γ =< {α(e) | e ∈A(D −B)} > be the subgroup of Sn generated by
{α(e) | e ∈A(D −B)}. For h ∈Γ, the matrix Ph = (p(h)
ij ) is deﬁned as follows:
p(h)

If (u, v) ∈A(D −B) and α(u, v) = h, then j = α(u, v)(i) = h(i), i.e., ((u, i),
(v, j)) ∈A((D −B)α). Thus we have

Bartholdi Zeta Functions of Branched Coverings of

Let D be a connected digraph and N = {1, 2, . . ., n}. Furthermore, let Dα
B be a
branched n-covering of D with branch set B of index 1, where α : A(D −B) −→
Sn is a pseudo permutation voltage assignment.
Next, let Γ =< {α(e) | e ∈A(D −B)} >, and let ρ1 = 1, ρ2, . . . , ρk be the
inequivalent irreducible unitary representations of Γ, and fi the degree of ρi for
each i, where f1 = 1. Furthermore, let P : Γ →GL(n, C) be a permutation
representation of Γ such that P(g) = Pg, and mi the multiplicity of ρi in P for
each i = 1, . . . , k, that is, P is equivalent to a representation m1 ⊕m2 ◦ρ2 ⊕· · ·⊕
mk ◦ρk. Assume that (D −B)α is connected. Then we have m1 = 1(see [15]).
Let M1 ⊕· · ·⊕Ms be the block diagonal sum of square matrices M1, . . . , Ms.
If M1 = M2 = · · · = Ms = M, then we write s ◦M = M1 ⊕· · · ⊕Ms.
By the fact of group representation, there exists a nonsigular matrix U such
that
U−1P(h)U = (1) ⊕m2 ◦ρ2(h) ⊕· · · ⊕mk ◦ρk(h)
(1)
for each h ∈Γ(see [15]).
Since (D −B)α is connected, [6, Theorem 2.5.2] implies that Γ acts tran-
sitively on {1, 2, . . ., n}. We use Lemma 6.2 in Deng, Sato and Wu [4] (c.f.,
[3, Lemma 4.2]).
Lemma 2 (Deng, Sato and Wu). The matrix U in (1) can be chosen to
satisfy
JU = (√n0 · · · 0) and U−1tJ = t(√n0 · · · 0).
For an induced subdigraph K of a connected digraph D, let the matrix SD;K be a
| V (K) |×| V (K) | diagonal matrix with diagonal elements sD(w1), . . . , sD(wm),
where V (K) = {w1, . . . , wm}.
Theorem 6. Let D be a connected digraph with ν vertices and ϵ arcs, N =
{1, 2, · · ·, n} and Dα
B a branched n-covering of D with branch set B of index 1,
where α : A(D −B) −→Sn is a pseudo permutation voltage assignment.
Set ϵ1 =| {e ∈A(< B >D) | e−1 ∈A(< D >B)} | /2, ϵ2 =| {e ∈A(D −B) |
e−1 ∈A(D −B)} | /2, ϵ3 =| {e ∈(B, ¯B) | e−1 ∈( ¯B, B)} | /2, ν1 =| B |,
ν2 =| V (D −B) | and Γ =< {α(e) | e ∈A(D −B)} >. Furthermore, let
ρ1 = 1, ρ2, . . . , ρk be the inequivalent irreducible representations of Γ, and fi the
degree of ρi for each i, where f1 = 1. Let P : Γ →GL(n, C) be a permutation
representation of Γ such that P(g) = Pg. Assume that (D −B)α is connected
and P = 1 ⊕m2 ◦ρ2 ⊕· · · ⊕mk ◦ρk.
For g ∈Γ, the matrix A0,g = (a(g)
uv ) is deﬁned as follows:
a(g)
uv :=
1 if (u, v) ∈A(D −B),(v, u) ̸∈A(D −B) and α(u, v) = g,
0 otherwise.
Furthermore, the matrix A1,g = (b(g)

b(g)

The Bartholdi Zeta Function of a Graph Having a
Semi-Free Action
We consider a graph having a semi-free action(see [3,9]).
Let G be a connected graph and Γ a subgroup of the automorphism group
Aut G. Furthermore, let π : G −→G/Γ be the projection deﬁned by π(v) = [v]
and π(e) = [e] for any v ∈V (G) and e ∈D(G), where [v] is the Γ-orbit of v,
etc. Then Γ acts semi-freely on G if there exists a subset B of V (G) such that
Γ is trivial on < B >G and acts freely on G −B. Note that π | G−π−1(B) :
G −π−1(B) −→G/Γ −B is a regular covering, and so there exists an ordinary
voltage assignment α : D(K−B) −→Γ such that Kα ∼= G−B, where K = G/Γ.
Let K be a connected graph, B ⊂V (K), Γ a ﬁnite group and α : D(K−B) −→
Γ an ordinary voltage assignment. Then we deﬁne a branched Γ-covering Kα
B with
branch set B of index 1 similarly to a branched n-covering of a digraph with branch
set of index 1. That is, a branched Γ-covering of K with branch set B of index 1 is
a branched | Γ |-covering of K with branch set of index 1. which the complement
of the totally ramiﬁed part is a Γ-covering of some graph.
By the above fact and the proof of Theorem 5, the following result holds.
Proposition 2. Let π : G −→K = G/Γ be a graph with a group Γ of auto-
morphisms of G acting semi-freely on G and B ⊂V (G) the trivial part of G.
Then there exists an ordinary voltage assignment α : D(K −B) −→Γ such that
Kα
B is isomrphic to G.

Thus, a graph with a semi-free action is a branched | Γ |-covering of a sym-
metric digraph, and so we obtain the following result by a similar method of
Theorem 6.
For an induced subgraph K of a connected graph G, let the matrix DG;K be a |
V (K) | × | V (K) | diagonal matrix with diagonal elementsdeg Gw1, . . . , deg Gwm,
where V (K) = {w1, . . . , wm}.
Theorem 7. Let G be a connected graph, Γ a subgroup of Aut g acting semi-
freely on G and B ⊂V (G) the trivial part of G. Furthermore, let α : D
(K −B) −→Γ be an ordinary voltage assignment such that (K −B)α ∼= G −B,
where K = G/Γ.
Set ϵ1 =| E(< B >K) |, ϵ2 =| E(K −B) |, ϵ3 =| {e = vw ∈E(K) | v ∈
B, w ∈¯B} |, ν1 =| B | and ν2 =| V (K −B) |. Furthermore, let ρ1 = 1, ρ2, . . . , ρk
be the inequivalent irreducible representations of Γ, and fi the degree of ρi for
each i, where f1 = 1.
Then the reciprocal of the Bartholdi zeta function of G is
ζ(G, u, t)−1 = (1−(1−u)2t2)ϵ1−ν1+nϵ3 det(Iν −tA′

Abstract. A graph G is called super edge-magic if there exists a one-
to-one mapping f from V (G) ∪E(G) onto {1, 2, 3, · · · , |V (G)| + |E(G)|}
such that for each uv ∈E(G), f(u) + f(uv) + f(v) = c(f) is constant
and all vertices of G receive all smallest labels. Such a mapping is called
super edge-magic labeling of G. The super edge-magic strength of a graph
G is deﬁned as the minimum of all c(f) where the minimum runs over
all super edge-magic labelings of G. Since not all graphs are super edge-
magic, we deﬁne, the super edge-magic deﬁciency of a graph G as either
minimum n such that G∪nK1 is a super edge-magic graph or +∞if there
is no such n. In this paper, the bound of super edge-magic strength and
the super edge-magic deﬁciency of some families of graphs are obtained.

Introduction
All graphs considered are ﬁnite and simple. The graph G has the vertex-set
V (G) and edge-set E(G) where |V (G)| = p and |E(G)| = q. A bijection f :
V (G) ∪E(G) →{1, 2, 3, · · ·, p + q} is called edge-magic labeling of G if for every
edge xy of G, f(x) + f(xy) + f(y) is a constant c(f) (magic constant of f). The
graph that admits such a labeling is called an edge-magic graph. An edge-magic
labeling f is called super edge-magic if f(V (G)) = {1, 2, 3, · · ·, p} and a graph
that admits a super edge-magic labeling is called super edge-magic. The edge-
magic and super edge-magic concepts were ﬁrst introduced by Kotzig and Rosa
[9] and Enomoto, Llad´o, Nakamigawa and Ringel [5], respectively.
In their papers, Kotzig and Rosa [9], and Enomoto et al. [5] conjectured that
every tree is edge-magic and every tree is super edge-magic, respectively. These
conjectures have become very popular in the area of graph labeling. Some classes
of trees have been proved to admit a (super) edge-magic labeling, however these
conjectures still remain open.

On Super Edge-Magic Strength and Deﬁciency of Graphs
145
In this paper, we discuss two related concepts with super edge-magic labeling,
namely the super edge-magic strength and super edge-magic deﬁciency of a
graph. Some of our results give supporting examples to these conjectures.
In proving the main results, the following lemma will be frequently used.
Lemma 1. [6] A graph G with p vertices and q edges is super edge-magic if and
only if there exists a bijective function f : V (G) →{1, 2, · · ·, p} such that the
set S = {f(x) + f(y)|xy ∈E(G)} consists of q consecutive integers. In such a
case, f extends to a super edge-magic total labeling of G with the magic constant
c = p + q + min(S).
By this lemma, it suﬃces to exhibit the vertex labeling of a super edge-magic
graph.
Lemma 2. [5] If a graph G with p vertices and q edges is super edge-magic,
then q ≤2p −3.
In light of Lemma 2, the minimum degree of a super edge-magic graph is at
most 3. In particular for a triangle free graph, Figueroa-Centeno et al. [6] gave
a better bound than the bound in Lemma 2 as follows.
Lemma 3. [6] Let G be a triangle free super edge-magic graph with p (≥4)
vertices and q edges. Then, q ≤2p −5.

The Super Edge-Magic Strength of Graphs
The concept of the magic strength of a graph was ﬁrst introduced by Avadayap-
pan et.al [1]. They deﬁne the magic strength of a graph G, m(G), as the mini-
mum of all c(f) where the minimum is taken over all edge-magic labelings f of G.
That is, m(G) = min{c(f) : f is an edge-magic labeling of G}. Furthermore, the
concept of the super edge-magic strength of a graph was also introduced by Ava-
dayappan et.al [2]. The super edge-magic strength of G, sm(G), is deﬁned as the
minimum of all c(f) where the minimum is taken over all super edge-magic label-
ings f of G. That is, sm(G) = min{c(f) : f is a super edge-magic labeling of G}.
In [2], the super edge-magic strength of some classes of graphs such as for paths
Pn, stars K1,n, odd cycles C2n+1, P 2
n, and a union of odd number copies of P2
were determined. In this paper, we determine the bounds for the super edge-
magic strength of some particular type of trees.
The ﬁrst type of tree which we consider is a ﬁre cracker. In [4], Chen, Li, and
Yeh deﬁned a ﬁre cracker as a tree obtained from the concatenation of stars by
linking one leaf from each. Swaminathan and Jeyanthi [12] gave the bound for
the super edge-magic strength of a ﬁre cracker with equal number of pendant
edges for each star. In this section, we give the bounds for the super edge-magic
strength of a ﬁre cracker with each star has a diﬀerent number of pendant edges.
First, let G1 be a ﬁre cracker deﬁned as follows.
V (G1) = {ui, ui,i : 1 ≤i ≤n} ∪{uj
i,i : 1 ≤i ≤n, 1 ≤j ≤mi},

and
E(G1) = {uiui+1 : 1 ≤i ≤n −1} ∪{uiui,i : 1 ≤i ≤n}
∪{ui,iuj
i,i : 1 ≤i ≤n, 1 ≤j ≤mi},
where m1 < m2 < m3 < · · · < mn.
Clearly, G1 has 2n + n
i=1 mi vertices. Among these vertices, two vertices
has degree 2, n −2 vertices have degree 3, one vertex of degree mi + 1 for each
i = 1, 2, 3, · · ·, n, and n
i=1 mi vertices have degree 1. To present our ﬁrst result,
we introduce the constant α deﬁned as follows.
α =
 n−1
2 , for odd n,
n−2
2 , for even n.

magic with

Proof. Let f be any super edge-magic labeling of G1 with the magic constant
c(f). We consider four following cases:
Case 1. m1 = 1 and m2 = 2.
In this case, G1 has n
i=1 mi vertices of degree 1, three vertices of degree 2, n−1

Case 3. m1 = 2.
In this case, G1 has n

Theorem 2. If G2 is a lobster deﬁned as above, then G2 is super edge-magic.
Proof. First, we deﬁne two constants λ and μ as follows.

t=1

and
μ =

for even n.
Next, consider a vertex labeling f : V (G2) →{1, 2, 3, · · ·, p} deﬁned as follows.
f(ui) =

1
2(3i −1) + i
t=1 mt +  i−1
2
t=1 l2t, if i is odd,
λ + 3i
2 + i

2
t=0 l2t+1, if i is even.
f(vi,1) =

λ + 1
2(3i −1) + i
t=2 mt +  i−3
2
t=0 l2t+1, if i is odd,
1
2(3i −2) + i
t=1 mt +  i−2
2
t=1 l2t,
if i is even.
f(vi,2) = f(vi,1) + li + 1, for all i.
We label all pendant vertices with the following formula.
f(vj
i,1) =

3
2(i −1) + j + i−1

f(vj

1
2(3i −1) + j + i
t=1 mt +  i−1
2
t=1 l2t, if i is odd, 1 ≤j ≤mi+1,
λ + 3i
2 + j + i
t=2 mt +  i−2
2
t=0 l2t+1, if i is even, 1 ≤j ≤mi+1.
f(wi,h) = f(vi,1) + h,
for 1 ≤i ≤n, and 1 ≤h ≤li.
Finally, one can verify that S = {f(x) + f(y) : xy ∈E(G2)} is a set of
consecutive integers with max(S) = p + λ. By Lemma 1, f extends to a super
edge-magic labeling of G2 with the magic constant 2p + 1 + λ.

The Super Edge-Magic Deﬁciency of Graphs
The edge-magic deﬁciency of a graph G, μ(G), is the minimum nonnegative
integer n such that G ∪nK1 has an edge-magic labeling. Kotzig and Rosa [9]
proved that the edge-magic deﬁciency of a graph is always ﬁnite.
Motivated by the Kotzig and Rosa’s concept, Figueroa-Centeno et al. [7] de-
ﬁned the notion of super edge-magic deﬁciency of a graph. The super edge-magic
deﬁciency of a graph G, μs(G), is the minimum nonnegative integer n such that
G∪nK1 has a super edge-magic labeling or +∞if there exists no such n. Unlike
the edge-magic deﬁciency, not all graphs have ﬁnite super edge-magic deﬁciency.
The examples of such graphs can be found in [7]. As a direct consequence of the
above two deﬁnitions, we have that for every graph G, μ(G) ≤μs(G).
Figueroa-Centeno et al. in two separate papers [7,8] provided the exact values
of (super) edge-magic deﬁciencies of several classes of graphs, such as complete
graphs, some classes of forests, 2-regular graphs, and complete bipartite graphs
K2,m. They also provided an upper bound of the super edge-magic deﬁciency of
complete bipartite graphs Km,n.
In [11], Ngurah, Baskoro and Simanjuntak proved that the double fan Fn,2 ∼=
Pn +2K1 is super edge-magic if and only if n ≤2. Additionally, they proved the
following result.

Theorem 3. [11] The super edge-magic deﬁciency of Fn,2 satisﬁes ⌊n−1
2 ⌋≤
μs(Fn,2) ≤n −2 for all n ≥2.
In the next theorem, we show that for even n the super edge-magic deﬁciency
of Fn,2 is equal to its lower bound.
Theorem 4. For even n and n ≥4, μs(Fn,2) = n−2
2 .
Proof. Let G ∼= Fn,2 ∪n−2
2 K1 be a graph having
V (G) = {x, y, zi : 1 ≤i ≤n} ∪{wi : 1 ≤i ≤n −2
2
},
and
E(G) = {xzi : 1 ≤i ≤n} ∪{yzi : 1 ≤i ≤n} ∪{zizi+1 : 1 ≤i ≤n −1}.
Now, deﬁne a vertex labeling f : V (G) →{1, 2, 3, · · ·, 3n+2
2
} as follows.
f(u) =
⎧
⎨
⎩

if u = x,

if u = y,
⌊1
2(3i + 1)⌋, if u = zi, for 1 ≤i ≤n,
and
f({wi : 1 ≤i ≤1
2(n −2)}) = {4, 7, 10, · · ·, 1
2(3n −4)}.
It can be checked that S = {f(u)+f(v) : uv ∈E(V (G)} is a set of consecutive
integers with max(S) = 3n + 1. By Lemma 1, f extends to a super edge-magic
labeling of G with the magic constant 1
2(9n + 6). By this fact and Theorem 3,
we conclude μs(Fn,2) = n−2
2 .
2
In [11], we showed that μs(F3,2) = 1, μs(F5,2) = 2, and μs(F7,2) = 3. Here, we
prove that μs(F9,2) = 4, μs(F11,2) = 5, and μs(F13,2) = 6 by labeling the vertices
{x, y; z1, z2, · · · , zn} of Fn,2 for n = 9, 11, and 13 as follows: {4, 9; 5, 3, 1, 2, 11, 14,
12, 15, 13}, {1, 18; 3, 6, 4, 7, 5, 14, 12, 15, 13, 16, 2}, and {2, 21; 10, 3, 1, 6, 8, 7, 9, 17,
15, 18, 16, 19, 4}. Based on this fact, we propose the following conjecture.
Conjecture 1. For odd n, n ≥3, μs(Fn,2) = n−1
2 .
In the following results, we consider the super edge-magic deﬁciency of mKn1,n2.
We start with mK2,2.
If mK2,2 has a super edge-magic labeling f, then the magic constant is
c(f) =

= 1
2(16m2 + 6m + 1).
However c(f) cannot be integer for all values of m. Hence, we have the following
lemma.

Lemma 4. For every integer m ≥1 the graph mK2,2 is not super edge-magic.

Theorem 5. For every integer m ≥1,
μs(mK2,2) ≤
m,
for odd m,
m −1, for even m.
Proof. For 1 ≤i ≤m, let V i
1 and V i
2 be the partite sets of the ith-component of
mK2,2. Next, deﬁne a vertex labeling g as follows.
g(V i
1 ) = {i, m + i},
g(V i

It is easy to verify that S = {g(x)+g(y) : xy ∈E(mK2,2) is a set of consecutive
integers with max(S) = ⌊1
2(13n + 1)⌋. We can also verify that the labels are all
positive and no labels are repeated. However, the largest vertex label used is 5m
if m is odd or 5m −1 if m is even, and there exist m labels if m is odd or m −1
labels if m is even that are not utilized. So, for each of the numbers between 1
and the largest vertex label that has not been used as a label, we introduce a
new vertex with that number as its label, which gives m or m −1 new isolated
vertices depend on parity of m. By Lemma 1, g extends to a super edge-magic
labeling of mK2,2 ∪mK1 or mK2,2 ∪(m−1)K1 with magic constant 1
2(23m+3)
for odd m or 23m

for even m. This completes the proof.

Open Problem 6. Find a better upper bound of μs(mK2,2).
By a similar argument in Lemma 4, we have the following fact.
Lemma 5. For every even integer m ≥2 the graph mK3,3 is not super edge-
magic.
2
Theorem 7. For every integer m ≥1,
μs(mK3,3) ≤3m + 1
Proof. Consider a vertex labeling h deﬁned as follows.
h(W) =
{4i −3, 4i −2, 4i −1},
if W = V i
1 for 1 ≤i ≤m,
{4m + 5i −5, 4m + 5i −2, 4m + 5i + 1}, if W = V i
2 for 1 ≤i ≤m,
where V i
1 and V i
2 are the partite sets of the ith-component of mK3,3.
One can verify that the maximum vertex label used under the labeling h is
9m + 1. Also, it is no diﬃcult to verify that S = {h(u) + h(v) : uv ∈E(mK3,3)}
is a set of consecutive integers with max(S) = 13m. By Lemma 1, h extends
to a super edge-magic labeling of mK3,3 ∪(3m + 1)K1 with the magic constant
22m + 2.

Open Problem 8. For even m, ﬁnd a better upper bound of μs(mK3,3).
For m ≥3 odd, we have not found any super edge-magic labeling of mK3,3.
Therefore, we propose the following open problem.
Open Problem 9. For m ≥3 odd, determine if there is a super edge-magic
labeling of mK3,3.
Theorem 10. For every integers n1, n2 ≥4, and m ≥1,
⌊mn1n2
2
⌋−m(n1 + n2) + 3 ≤μs(mKn1,n2) ≤m(n1n2 −n1 −n2) + 1.
Proof. This graph is not super edge-magic by Lemma 2. Without lost of gen-
erality, we assume that n1 ≤n2. For 1 ≤i ≤m, let V i
1 and V i
2 be the par-
tite sets of the ith- component of mKn1,n2. Now, deﬁne a vertex labeling f
such that f(V i
1 ) = {a1, a1 + 1, a1 + 2, a1 + 3, · · · , a1 + (n1 −1)}, and f(V i
2 ) =
{a2, a2 + n1, a2 + 2n1, a2 + 3n1, · · · , a2 + (n2 −1)n1}, where a1 = n1(i −1) + i,
and a2 = m(n1 + 1) + (i −1)(n1n2 −n1 −1). One can verify that the maximum
vertex label used is mn1n2 + 1, and S = {f(u) + f(v) : uv ∈E(mKn1,n2)} is a
set of consecutive integers with max(S) = m(n1n2 + n1 + 1). By Lemma 1, f
extends to a super edge-magic labeling of mKn1,n2 ∪(m(n1n2 −n1 −n2) + 1)K1
with the magic constant m(2n1n2 + n1 + 1) + 2.
The lower bound is obtained from Lemma 2, since bipartite graphs contain
no odd cycles.

Open Problem 11. Find a better lower and upper bounds of μs(mKn1,n2) for

The above results concern on super edge-magic deﬁciency of disconnected graphs
whose components are isomorphic. The following result present super edge-magic
deﬁciency of disconnected graphs whose components are not isomorphic.

6(m + 3)(m + 4)(2m + 7) −(m + 5).
Proof. This graph has minimum degree 4, by Lemma 2, it is not a super edge-
magic graph. Let V i
1 and V i
2 be the partite sets of Gi, 0 ≤i ≤m. Consider a
vertex labeling g such that
g(U) = {b1, b1 + 1, b1 + 2, · · · , b1 + i + 3} if U = V i
1 for 0 ≤i ≤m, and
g(U) = {b2, b2+(4+i), b2+2(4+i), · · · , b2+(i+3)(4+i)} if U = V i

where b1 = 1
2(i2 +9i+2), and b2 = 1
2(m+1)(m+8)+(m+1)+ 1

By Lemma 1, g extends to a super edge-magic labeling of G ∪( 1

Lemma 2.

In above results, we present the upper bound of the super edge-magic deﬁciency
of mKn1,n2 for some values of n1 and n2. However, these results do not include
cases for mK1,n, mK2,n, and mK3,n. In fact, we are not able to determine
whether these graphs are super edge-magic or not. However, for graph mK1,n
in case n = 1, 2, we have the following results. Notice that, it is well known
that K1,n is a super edge-magic and 3-colorable graph. So, mK1,n is super edge-
magic for odd m, that is, μs(mK1,n) = 0, for odd m. For even m, we only known
that μs(mK1,1) = 1 (see [7]), and μs(mK1,2) = 0 (see [3]). Hence, we have the
following open problems.
Open Problem 14. For even m ≥2 and n ≥3, determine if there is a super
edge-magic labeling of mK1,n.
Open Problem 15. For m ≥2 and n ≥3, determine if there is a super edge-
magic labeling of mK2,n.

Abstract. In this paper, we consider Hamiltonian cycles of vertices in
convex position on the plane, where, in general, these cycles contain
crossing edges. We give several results concerning the minimum num-
ber of operations that delete two crossing edges, add two other edges
and preserve hamiltonicity in transforming these cycles to non-crossing
Hamiltonian cycles.

Introduction
In this paper, we consider Hamiltonian cycles on the plane. Let S be a set of n
vertices on the plane, and let the vertices be labeled from 1 to n. We denote a
Hamiltonian cycle passing through vertices i1, i2, · · · , in by (i1, i2, · · · , in). For
example, we write (1, 3, 5, 4, 7, 2, 8, 6) for the cycle in Fig. 1. We regard the Hamil-
tonian cycles (i1, i2, · · · , in), (i2, · · · , in, i1) and (in, in−1, · · · , i1) to be equiva-
lent. An operation that deletes two crossing edges and adds two other edges
while preserving hamiltonicity will be termed a ﬂip in this paper.
The present study considers the following problem: For a given Hamiltonian
cycle, ﬁnd the minimum number of ﬂips required to obtain a non-crossing Hamil-
tonian cycle. Note that the repetition of ﬂips is similar to 2-OPT, which is one
of the most famous local search methods for the Traveling Salesman Problem:
For a Hamiltonian cycle C on the plane, if a Hamiltonian cycle C′ is con-
structed from C by deleting two edges and adding two other edges such that
the total Euclidean distance of C′ is less than that of C, the transformation
from C to C′ is called a feasible 2-change. The procedure that repeats feasi-
ble 2-change operations until no further feasible 2-changes are possible is called
2-OPT. Recently, Englert et al. proved the following theorem:
Theorem A (Englert, R¨oglin and V¨ocking, 2007 [2]). There exists a set
of n vertices S on the plane together with a Hamiltonian cycle C of S such that
we need Ω(2
n
8 ) feasible 2-change operations to reach a local optimal solution
from C.

Regarding ﬂip operations on the plane, van Leeuwen and Schoone presented the
following theorem:
Theorem B (van Leeuwen and Schoone, 1980 [7]).
Let S be a set of n
vertices arranged in general positions on the plane, that is, no three vertices are
collinear. Any Hamiltonian cycle of S can be transformed into a non-crossing
Hamiltonian cycle by O(n3) ﬂips.
We note that van Leeuwen and Schoone proved a slightly stronger theorem
than the one above, that is, the vertices in S are not supposed to be in general
positions, but they admitted two other types of operations that untangle edges
or paths of three or more collinear vertices. In this paper, we shall consider a
set of vertices in convex position. A convex cycle is a Hamiltonian cycle whose
vertices are arranged in convex position, and these vertices are supposed to be
labeled from 1 to n in cyclic order (see Fig. 1 again). Let An be the set of convex
cycles on S of order n and let δ(C) be the minimum number of ﬂips required to
obtain a non-crossing convex Hamiltonian cycle of the form In := (1, 2, 3, · · · , n)
from a convex cycle C. This study considers the following problem:
Problem. Find the value δ(n) such that
δ(n) := max
C∈An δ(C).
In this paper, we give several results for the above problem. In Section 2, we
give lower and upper bounds on the minimum number of ﬂips and, moreover,
we describe some restricted sets of convex cycles for which an exact value for
the minimum number of ﬂips can be obtained. In Section 3, some computational
results will be presented. The related problems are discussed in [3,4,5,8]. Pach
and Tardos [8] presented a diﬀerent type of transformation; in each step we
can arbitrarily relocate one of its vertices on the plane. They gave upper and
lower bounds on the minimum number of steps required to obtain a non-self-
intersecting closed polygon from an arbitrary self-intersecting closed polygon. In
[3], the authors gave several results concerning the operations that delete two
edges, add two other edges and preserve hamiltonicity, where we do not care

if these two edges are crossing or non-crossing. Ito, Uehara and Yokoyama [4]
and Ito [5] gave several properties of convex cycles which will be discussed in
Section 2.

Main Results
We ﬁrst give the following upper bound for general convex cycles.
Theorem 1. For any integer n ≥4,
δ(n) ≤2n −7.
For convenience, we give orientations for each edge of a convex cycle, so such a
cycle may be regarded as a directed cycle. Since a ﬂip preserves hamiltonicity,
the following fact is easy to understand (see Fig. 2).
Fact 1. Upon applying a ﬂip to the pair of arcs (u1, v1) and (u2, v2) of a convex
cycle, the new added edges are (u1, u2) and (v1, v2), i.e. one of the added edges
connects the tails u1 and u2 of the deleted arcs, while the other connects the
heads v1 and v2.
Let e = (u, v) be an edge with u < v. The depth of e is deﬁned as the minimum
of v −u and u −v + n, which means the minimum diﬀerence of the labels of u
and v modulo n.
Lemma 1. Any convex cycle C can be transformed into a convex cycle contain-
ing a boundary edge by at most one ﬂip.
Proof. Let e be an edge of minimum depth in C. We may suppose that the depth
m of e is more than 1, and that the tail of e is vertex 1 and the head of e is vertex
m + 1 by symmetry. Let e′ be the edge whose tail is vertex 2. Then, e and e′ are
crossing because of the minimality of the depth of e. With reference to Fact 1,
the ﬂip on the pair {e, e′} therefore produces the new boundary edge (1, 2).
⊓⊔
Proof (of Theorem 1). We use induction on n. It is easy to check that δ(4) = 1.
Assume n ≥5. By Lemma 1, at most one ﬂip is required to produce a new
convex cycle C′ containing a boundary edge e = (u, u + 1) (u may be considered
in modulo n) from an arbitrary convex cycle C. We then contract the edge e of
C′ and denote the resulting cycle with n −1 vertices by ˜C′. By the induction
hypothesis, it holds that δ( ˜C′) ≤2(n −1) + 7. Hence, after at most δ( ˜C′) + 1
ﬂips, the convex cycle C can be transformed into In or a cycle of the form
(· · · , u −1, u + 1, u, u + 2, · · · ).
For the latter case, by operating one more ﬂip on the pair of edges {(u −1, u +
1), (u, u + 2)}, we obtain In. Therefore, we have
δ(n) ≤δ( ˜C′) + 1 + 1 ≤{2(n −1) + 7} + 1 + 1 = 2n −7.
⊓⊔
Next, we give lower bounds on δ(n).

Theorem 2. For any integer n ≥3,
δ(n) ≥

n −3
if n = 3, 4, 6,
n −2
if n = 5 or n ≥7.
In order to prove Theorem 2 it is convenient to deﬁne some particular convex
cycles. Let Cn,p be the convex cycle traversing every p steps in cyclic order. For
example, Fig. 3 shows the convex cycle C8,3. We may assume that n and p are
mutually prime, since otherwise Cn,p does not form a Hamiltonian cycle. Set
δ(n, p) := δ(Cn,p).
We prove the following theorem.
Theorem 3. For any odd integer n ≥5,
δ(n, 2) = n −2.
Here we introduce some deﬁnitions. A Hamiltonian cycle is called pyramidal if
the cycle is the form of 1 = v0, v1, · · · , vr = n, vr+1, · · · , vn−1, vn = 1 such that
v0 < v1 < · · · < vr > vr+1 > · · · > vn−1 > vn. The concept of pyramidal cycles
is frequently used for special cases of the Traveling Salesman Problem (see [1,6]).
The following fact is fundamental.
Fact 2. Let C be a convex pyramidal directed cycle. For any pair of crossing arcs
(i, j) and (k, l) with i < k, it holds that either i < l < j < k or l < i < k < j.
Proof. If neither i < l < j < k nor l < i < k < j holds, then either i < k < j < l
or j < l < i < k. However, both these cases contradict the pyramidal property
of C.

Proof (of Theorem 3). It is easy to see that n −2 ﬂips on {(1, n −1), (2, n)},
{(1, 3), (2, 4)}, {(1, 4), (3, 5)}, {(1, 5), (4, 6)},· · ·, {(1, n−1), (n−2, n)} from Cn,2
results in the non-crossing convex cycle In. So, it holds that δ(n, 2) ≤n −2.
Next, we shall show that δ(n, 2) ≥n −2. By symmetry, one ﬂip results in
a unique convex cycle if we ignore the labeling on vertices. Without loss of
generality, we may assume that the cycle is the form of (1, 2, 4, 6, · · · , n −1, n,

n −2, n −4, · · · , 3, 1). Set C+
n,2 to be this convex cycle (see Fig. 5). It is clear
that the convex cycle C+
n,2 is pyramidal.
Claim. Let C be a convex pyramidal cycle. Any convex cycle obtained from C
by any ﬂip is pyramidal.
Proof. We give orientations for all the edges of C so that it becomes a directed
cycle. By Fact 2 and symmetry, we may assume that C has a pair of crossing arcs
(i, j) and (k, l) with i < l < j < k. By Fact 1, the ﬂip on that pair of edges pro-
duces the convex cycle C ∪{(i, k), (j, l)} −{(i, j), (k, l)}, which is pyramidal.
⊓⊔
We note that C+
n,2 is a convex pyramidal cycle and has two boundary edges (1, 2)
and (n −1, n). Upon applying a ﬂip, the number of boundary edges (i, i + 1)
with 2 ≤i ≤n −2 increases by at most 1 according to Facts 1 and 2, and the
resulting cycle is also convex and pyramidal by the above claim. By repeating
this argument, we know that at least n −3 ﬂips must be applied to C+
n,2 in
order to obtain a cycle containing boundary edges (i, i + 1) with 1 ≤i ≤n −1.
Therefore, we have δ(n, 2) ≥1 + (n −3) = n −2. Thus, Theorem 3 follows.
⊓⊔
Next, we deﬁne the convex cycle Dn of n vertices for any even integer n as
follows:
Dn = (1, 3, 5, · · · , n −5, n −2, n, n −3, n −1, 2, 4, 6, · · · , n −4).
For example, D8 and D10 are in Fig. 6.

Theorem 4. For any even integer n ≥8,
δ(Dn) ≥n −2.
Proof. Deﬁne two subpaths of Dn as follows:
Xn−2 = (y1, 2, 4, · · · , n −4, 1, 3, · · · , n −5, y2)
Y = (x1, n −2, n, n −3, n −1, x2),
where y1 = n −1, y2 = n −2, x1 = n −5 and x2 = 2 at this point. We note that
Xn−2 and Y contain two edges (n −1, 2) and (n −5, n −2) in common.
In order to obtain In from Dn, it is clearly necessary to transform Xn to the
path (y′
1, 1, 2, · · · , n −4, y′
2) and to transform Y to the path (x′
1, n −3, n −2, n −
1, n, x′
2), where n −3 ≤y′
i ≤n and 1 ≤x′
i ≤n −4 for i = 1, 2. It is easy to see
that if we regard y1 and y2 as the same vertex in Xn−2, then the graph ˜Xn−2
is isomorphic to Cn−3,2. Similarly, if we regard x1 and x2 as the same vertex in
Y , then the graph ˜Y is isomorphic to C5,2. We note that any ﬂip on the pair
{(x, y), (x′, x′′)} with 1 ≤x, x′, x′′ ≤n −4 and y = y1 or y2 has no eﬀect on
the path of vertices in {n −3, n −2, n −1, n} and that any ﬂip on the pair
{(x, y), (y′, y′′)} with x = x1 or x2 and n −3 ≤y, y′, y′′ ≤n has no eﬀect on the
path of vertices in {1, 2, · · · , n −4}. So, we have
δ(Dn) ≥δ(Cn−3,2) + δ(C5,2) = {(n −3) −2} + (5 −2) = n −2.
⊓⊔
Now, we prove Theorem 2.
Proof (of Theorem 2). It is easy to check that δ(3) = 0, δ(4) = 1, δ(5) = 3 and
δ(6) = 3. For any integer n ≥7 Theorems 3 and 4 imply Theorem 2.
⊓⊔
Next, we prove the following theorem for δ(n, 3).
Theorem 5. For any integer n ≥7,
δ(n, 3) =
⎧
⎨
⎩
n + 3

if n ≡1, 5 (mod 6),
n

if n ≡2, 4 (mod 6).

Proof. First of all, we show
δ(n, 3) ≥
⎧
⎨
⎩
n + 3
2
if n ≡1, 5 (mod 6),
n
2
if n ≡2, 4 (mod 6).
(1)
It is clear that the number of boundary edges that arise due to a ﬂip is at most
two. Thus, we have δ(n, 3) ≥
n
2

. It remains to show that δ(n, 3) > n + 1
2
if
n is odd. Suppose that δ(n, 3) = n + 1
2
. For this case, by the same reasoning as
above, exactly one new boundary edge is produced by a single ﬂip F, while two
new boundary edges are produced by each of the other n + 1
2
−1 ﬂips. When two
new boundary edges are produced by a ﬂip, the depths of the deleted two edges
must be the same. Since the last ﬂip that operates to obtain In produces two
new boundary edges, ﬂip F cannot be the last one. Since any edge of Cn,3 has
depth 3, any ﬂip before F deletes two edges of depth 3 and adds two (boundary)
edges of depth 1. Furthermore, the depths of the two edges that arise due to
ﬂip F are 1 and 5 by Facts 1 and 2. Let e be the edge of depth 5. Any ﬂip that
follows F produces two new boundary edges. One of these has to use e, but this
is impossible since after F the convex cycle consists of e and edges of depth 1
or 3. Therefore, we have δ(n, 3) > n + 1
2
if n is odd. Thus, the inequality (1)
holds.
Next, we shall prove
δ(n, 3) ≤

Thus, we may assume n ≥10. Here we shall prove the following claim.
Claim. For any integer n ≥10 with n ≡1 (mod 3),
δ(n, 3) ≤δ(n −2, 3) + 1.
Proof. By the ﬂip on the pair {(1, n−2), (2, n−1)} for Cn,3, we have the convex
cycle
(1, 2, 5, · · · , n −2, n −1, n −4, n −7, · · · , 3, n, n −3, · · · , 4).
Let C+
n,3 be the above cycle. Moreover, by the next ﬂip on the pair {(n, n −
3), (n −1, n −4)}, we have the cycle En
(1, 2, 5, · · · , n −5, n −2, n −1, n, 3, 6, · · · , n −4, n −3, n −6, · · · , 4).
Let
E′
n = (1, 2, 5, · · · , n −5, n −2, 3, 6, · · · , n −4, n −3, n −6, · · · , 4),
which is obtained from En by replacing the path (n−2, n−1, n) with the vertex
n −2. Then, E′
n ≃C+
n−2,3. By using induction, we have
δ(n, 3) ≤δ(n −2, 3) −1 + 2 = δ(n −2, 3) + 1.
Thus, the claim follows.
⊓⊔
By the above claim, in case of n ≡1 (mod 6) it holds that δ(n, 3) ≤δ(n −
2, 3) + 1 ≤(n −2) + 3
2
+ 1 = n + 3
2
since n −2 ≡5 (mod 6). Also, in the case
that n ≡4 (mod 6) we have δ(n, 3) ≤δ(n −2, 3) + 1 ≤n −2
2
+ 1 = n
2 because
n −2 ≡2 (mod 6). Therefore, inequality (3) is proved.
This completes the proof of Theorem 5.
⊓⊔
We have also derived upper bounds for cases in which p is even, p = 4, 6 and 8.
We have proved that δ(n, 4) ≤2
3n + O(1), δ(n, 6) ≤3
5n + O(1) and δ(n, 8) ≤
4
7n + O(1) for any suﬃciently large n, but do not present the proofs here.

Conclusion
Finally, we brieﬂy describe some computational results for δ(n) and δ(n, p). We
veriﬁed computationally that δ(n) = n −2 for any integer n from 7 to 10, and
present the list of convex cycles that require n −2 ﬂips to obtain In in Table 1.
We give the following conjecture:

dependence on modulo p. A precise expression of δ(n, p) for general values of n

Abstract. The k-sets of a set V of points in the plane are the subsets
of k points of V that can be separated from the rest by a straight line. In
order to ﬁnd all the k-sets of V , one can build the so called k-set polygon
whose vertices are the centroids of the k-sets of V . In this paper, we
extend the classical convex-hull divide and conquer construction method
to build the k-set polygon.
1
Introduction
Given a ﬁnite set V of |V | = n points in the Euclidean plane (no three of them
being collinear) and an integer k (0 < k ≤n), the k-set polygon gk(V ) of V is
the convex hull of the centroids g(T ) of all the subsets T of k elements of V . An-
drzejak and Fukuda [1] showed that the vertices of gk(V ) are the centroids of the
k-sets of V , i.e. of the subsets of k points of V that can be strictly separated from
the rest by a straight line. Thus, determining k-sets comes down to construct-
ing k-set polygons. Counting and constructing k-sets is an important problem
in computational geometry. Cole, Sharir, and Yap [4] have given an algorithm
to determine the k-sets by generalizing the convex hull algorithm of Jarvis [7].
Their algorithm can be implemented to run in O(n log n + m log2 k) time, where
m is the size of the output. In [6] we extended the incremental convex hull con-
struction algorithm to construct k-set polygons. The algorithm performance was
in O(n log n + k(n −k) log2 k) time and we showed that incremental algorithms
constructing k-set polygons may have to construct Ω(k(n −k)) edges.
In this paper we extend another classical convex hull construction method to
the k-set polygon, namely the divide and conquer method. Our algorithm works
similarly in that it starts by dividing the set of points V recursively into subsets of
relatively equal size, then recursively constructs their k-set polygons, and ﬁnally
merges the two polygons. We ﬁrst characterize the edges to remove, which form
two connected lines on the k-set polygons to merge. We also show that the edges
to create can be obtained by considering k-set polygons of only 2k points. This
leads to an algorithm that constructs the k-set polygon of n points in O(n log n +
m log2 k log(n/k)) time, where m is the worst case size of the output.

straight line generated by st, and by (st)+ (resp. (st)−) the open half plane on the
left (resp. right) of (st). (st)+ and (st)−denote the closures of (st)+ and (st)−.
Let us ﬁrst recall two important properties of the vertices and edges of k-set
polygons given by Andrzejak and Fukuda [1], and by Andrzejak and Welzl [2].
Proposition 1. The centroid g(T ) of a subset T of k points of V is a vertex of
gk(V ) if and only if T is a k-set of V . Moreover, the centroids of distinct k-sets
are distinct vertices.
Proposition 2. g(T )g(T ′) is an oriented edge of gk(V ) if and only if there exist
two points s and t of V and a subset P of k−1 points of V such that T = P ∪{s},
T ′ = P ∪{t}, and V ∩(st)−= P.
Such an oriented edge will be denoted by eP (s, t); g(P ∪{s}) will be called its
start vertex, and g(P ∪{t}) its end vertex. Note that eP (s, t) is parallel to (st)
(see Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. Edges and vertices of a 4-set polygon of 12 points
From the above propositions we can easily obtain the following:
Proposition 3. If eP (s, t) and eP ′(s′, t′) are two consecutive edges of gk(V ),
then the line segments st and s′t′ intersect.
Propositions 1 and 2, lead to an eﬃcient data structure to store k-set polygons.
Indeed, the boundary of gk(V ) can be stored in a circular list L whose elements
represent the edges of gk(V ). To any element e of L, which represents an edge
eP (s, t), are associated the two elements of L that represent the predecessor and
the successor of eP (s, t) on the boundary of gk(V ), as well as the two points s
and t of V . Note that, from Proposition 2, the k-sets deﬁning two consecutive
vertices of gk(V ) diﬀer from each other by one point and thus it suﬃces to know
one k-set T of V and one edge with endpoint g(T ) to be able to generate the
whole k-sets of V while traversing L. It follows that a k-set polygon with c edges
can be stored in a data structure of size O(c + k). In this paper we will store
in the data structure the two k-sets whose centroids are the leftmost and the
rightmost vertices of gk(V ).

Edge Removal
For the sake of simplicity of the exposition, we will assume that no two points
of V belong to a same vertical line and that no four distinct points of V belong
to two parallel lines.
Suppose now that the points of V are sorted with respect to the x-axis (from
left to right). Suppose also that we are given two subsets Vl and Vr of at least k
points of V each, having at most k−1 common points, and such that there exists
a vertical strip containing Vl ∩Vr. Vl \ Vr and Vr \ Vl are respectively on the left
and on the right side of the strip. More precisely, there exist two vertical straight
lines Δl and Δr oriented upwards such that Δl ⊂Δ+
r , Vr ⊂Δ−
l , Vl ⊂Δ+
r , and
Vl ∩Vr = (Δ−
l ∩Δ+
r ) ∩(Vl ∪Vr). Suppose furthermore that gk(Vl) and gk(Vr)
are given and that we want to construct gk(Vl ∪Vr). As in the construction of
the classical convex hull, the method consists in ﬁnding the edges to remove on
the given k-set polygons gk(Vl) and gk(Vr) and afterwards determining the new
edges to create in order to get gk(Vl ∪Vr) (see Fig. 2).

In this section we focus on the edges to remove. We notably characterize the
two connected lines that they form on gk(Vl) and gk(Vr).
Lemma 1. (i) If gk(Vl) (resp. gk(Vr)) is not reduced to a unique vertex, at least
one of the edges incident in its rightmost (resp. leftmost) vertex is to be removed.
(ii) The leftmost vertex of gk(Vl) and the rightmost vertex of gk(Vr) are ver-
tices of gk(Vl ∪Vr).
From now on we will consider gk(V )+ (resp. gk(V )−) to be the oriented polygonal
line of the edges of gk(V ) that connects the rightmost to the leftmost (resp.
leftmost to rightmost) vertex of gk(V ) in counter clockwise direction.
Obviously, an edge st precedes an edge s′t′ in counter clockwise direction
on gk(V )+ if and only if the angle θ(st) of the oriented line (st) with the x-
axis (oriented from left to right) is smaller than the angle θ(s′t′) of (s′t′) with
the x-axis. In the remainder of this paper the three following notations will be
equivalent: θ(st) < θ(s′t′), (st) <θ(s′t′), and st <θs′t′.

Lemma 2. Let eP (s, t) and eP ′(s′, t′) be two edges of the line gk(Vl)+ such that
eP (s, t) <θeP ′(s′, t′) and let r be a point of Vr \ Vl. If r ∈(s′t′)−then r ∈(st)−.
Proof. If eP (s, t) and eP ′(s′, t′) are two consecutive edges of gk(Vl)+, then from
Proposition 3, the line segments st and s′t′ intersect and, since Vl ⊂Δ+
r , their
intersection point belongs to Δ+
r . Moreover, since st <θs′t′, (s′t′)−∩Δ−
r ⊂(st)−.
It follows that, if a site r of Vr \Vl belongs to (s′t′)−, it also belongs to (st)−. By
an elementary induction, the result holds for any edges eP (s, t) and eP ′(s′, t′) of
gk(Vl)+ such that eP (s, t) <θeP ′(s′, t′).
⊓⊔
Similar results hold for gk(Vl)−, gk(Vr)+, and gk(Vr)−. Thus, using Proposition 2:
Theorem 1. The edges to remove on gk(Vl) (resp. gk(Vr)) form a connected line
which contains the rightmost vertex of gk(Vl) (resp. leftmost vertex of gk(Vr)).
Denote respectively by D+
left and D+
right the lines to remove on gk(Vl)+ and
gk(Vr)+, oriented in counter clockwise direction (see Fig. 3). That is, the right-
most vertex of gk(Vl) and the leftmost vertex of gk(Vr) are respectively the start
vertex of D+
left and the end vertex of D+
right.

We show now that the edges of D+
left can be found eﬃciently by only traversing
the edges to remove on the k-set polygons.
Given an oriented straight line Δ, we say that a set T is Δ-separable from V if
T is a subset of V such that Δ−∩V = T . Moreover, T is said to be //Δ-separable
from V if there exists a straight line Δ′, parallel to Δ and oriented as Δ, such
that T is Δ′-separable from V .
Lemma 3. An edge eP (s, t) of gk(Vl)+ is also an edge of gk(Vl∪Vr) if and only if
the k-element set Tr which is //(st)-separable from Vr is such that Tr\Vl ⊂(st)+.
Proof. If (Tr \Vl)∩(st)−̸= ∅then, from Proposition 2, eP (s, t) is not an edge of
gk(Vl ∪Vr). Conversely, if Tr \Vl ⊂(st)+, let Δ be a straight line parallel to (st),
oriented as (st), and such that Tr is Δ-separable from Vr. Since |Tr \ Vl| ≥1,
at least one point of Tr belongs to (st)+. It follows that Δ ⊂(st)+, that is,
Vr \ Tr ⊂(st)+. Hence, from Proposition 2, eP (s, t) is an edge of gk(Vl ∪Vr).
⊓⊔
Thus, ﬁnding the edges of D+
left comes down to ﬁnding the ﬁrst edge eP (s, t) of
gk(Vl)+ that veriﬁes Lemma 3. Now, given a straight line Δ, the k-element set
//Δ-separable from Vr can be found thanks to the following lemma:

Lemma 4. If the k-set polygon gk(Vr) is not reduced to a unique vertex, let
g(T0), ..., g(Tm) and eP1(s1, t1), ..., ePm(sm, tm) be the vertices and the edges
of gk(Vr)+, given in counter clockwise direction. Let Δ be an oriented straight
line with θ(Δ) ∈[π/2, 3π/2]. Ti is //Δ-separable from Vr if and only if,
- either i = 0 and Δ <θ(s1t1),
- or i ∈{1, . . . , m −1} and (siti) <θΔ <θ(si+1ti+1),
- or i = m and (smtm) <θΔ.
Proof. Since g(T0) is the rightmost vertex of gk(Vr), T0 can be separated from Vr
with a straight line Δ0 such that θ(Δ0) = π/2. The same, Tm can be separated
from Vr with a straight line Δm+1 such that θ(Δm+1) = 3π/2. For every i ∈
{1, . . ., m}, let Δi = (siti). Then, from Proposition 2, for every i ∈{0, . . ., m},
Ti ⊂Δ−
i ∩Δ−
i+1 and Vr \ Ti ⊂Δ+
i ∩Δ+
i+1. For every straight line Δ such that
Δi <θΔ <θΔi+1, the line Δ′, parallel to Δ, oriented as Δ, and passing through
x = Δi ∩Δi+1 is such that Δ−
i ∩Δ−
i+1 ⊂Δ′−and Δ+
i ∩Δ+
i+1 ⊂Δ′+. It follows
that Ti is //Δ-separable from Vr (if x ∈Vr, it suﬃces to move slightly Δ′ parallely
to itself such that it strictly separates Ti from Vr).
The converse follows directly from the fact that, for a given straight line Δ,
there exists at most one k-set Ti //Δ-separable from Vr.
⊓⊔
To avoid dealing with the special cases i = 0 and i = m in the algorithm, we add
two anchor-edges to the upper line gk(U)+ of the k-set polygon of any subset
U of V in the following way: If g(T ) is the rightmost vertex of gk(U)+, insert
an anchor-edge eP (s, t) with end vertex g(T ), such that t is the leftmost point
of T and s is any point in the plane having the same x-coordinate as t and a
smaller y-coordinate (note that, from the assumptions on V , s /∈V ). Clearly,
θ(st) = π/2. In the same way, if g(T ) is the leftmost vertex of gk(U)+, insert an
anchor-edge eP (s, t) with start vertex g(T ), such that s is the rightmost point
of T and t is any point in the plane having the same x-coordinate as s and a
smaller y-coordinate (i.e. θ(st) = 3π/2). Note that if gk(U)+ is reduced to a
unique vertex, this vertex will be incident to both anchor-edges.
The edges of D+
left can then be found by the following algorithm:
Algorithm 1 – Find D+
left
let eP (s, t) be the edge of gk(Vl)+ with start vertex the rightmost vertex of gk(Vl)+
let g(T ) be the leftmost vertex of gk(Vr)
let eP ′(s′, t′) be the edge of gk(Vr)+ with end vertex g(T ) (i.e. P ′ ∪{t′} = T )

eP (s, t) ←−successor of eP (s, t) on gk(Vl)

(3) while (P ′ ∪{t′}) \ Vl ̸⊂(st)+
eP (s, t) ←−successor of eP (s, t) on gk(Vl)
return eP (s, t)
For any polygonal line L, let |L| be the number of edges of L.

Proposition 4. (i) At the end of the algorithm, g(P ∪{s}) is the end vertex of
D+
left.
(ii) D+
left can be found in O(k + |D+
left| log k + |D+
right|) time.
Proof. (i.1) Every edge eP (s, t) of gk(Vl) traversed by the algorithm, except
possibly the last one, is to be removed since at least one of the points of Vr \ Vl
belongs to (st)−, as checked in loops (1) and (3) conditions. Note that these
loops necessarily stops at the latest on an anchor-edge.
(i.2) If eP (s, t) and eP ′(s′, t′) are the last edges encountered by the algorithm re-
spectively on gk(Vl)+ and on gk(Vr)+ then, from loop (2) condition, there exist two
consecutive edges eP ′
1(s′
1, t′
1) and eP ′
2(s′
2, t′
2) of gk(Vr)+ such that s′t′ ≤θs′
1t′
1 <θst
<θs′
2t′
2. From Lemma 4, P ′
1 ∪{t′
1} is then //(st)-separable from Vr. Moreover, from
loops (1) and (3) conditions, there exists an edge eP1(s1, t1) of gk(Vl)+ such that
s1t1 ≤θst and (P ′
1 ∪{t′
1}) \ Vl ⊂(s1t1)+. From Lemma 2, (P ′
1 ∪{t′
1}) \ Vl ⊂(st)+
and, from Lemma 3, eP (s, t) is an edge of gk(Vl ∪Vr). Since D+
left is connected, it
follows from (i.1) that g(P ∪{s}) is the end vertex of D+
left.
(ii.1) From (i.1), within a margin of one, only the edges to remove are tra-
versed on gk(Vl)+. Moreover, for every edge eP ′(s′, t′) of gk(Vr) traversed by the
algorithm, except for the last one, there exists an edge eP (s, t) of gk(Vl)+ such
that st <θs′t′ (loop (2) condition) and (P ′ ∪{t′}) \ Vl ⊂(st)+ (loops (1) and
(3) conditions). Since, (P ′ ∪{t′}) \ Vl contains at least one point and since this
point belongs to Δ−
r ∩(st)+, (st) ∩(s′t′) ∈Δ−
r . Thus (st)−∩Δ+
l ⊂(s′t′)−and,
since (st)−∩Δ+
l contains at least one point of (P ∪{s, t}) \ Vr, eP ′(s′, t′) is not
an edge of gk(Vl ∪Vr). It follows that, within a margin of one, only the edges to
remove are traversed on gk(Vr)+.
(ii.2) In loop (1), g(T ) is the leftmost vertex of gk(Vr) and, by hypothesis, T is
stored in the data structure containing gk(Vr). To check whether T \ Vl ⊂(st)+,
it suﬃces to compute the straight line passing through s, tangent to the convex
hull conv(T \Vl) at a point r, and such that conv(T \Vl) ⊂(rs)+. (T \Vl) ⊂(st)+
is then equivalent to r ∈(st)+. Since the points of V are sorted from left to right,
T \ Vl can be obtained in O(k) time and conv(T \ Vl) can also be computed in
O(k) time. Any tangent to conv(T \ Vl) can then be found in O(log k) time
(see for example [9]). The time complexity of loop (1) can thus be bounded by
O(k + |D+
left| log k).
(ii.3) From (ii.1), the test (P ′ ∪{t′}) \ Vl ̸⊂(st)+ in loop (3) condition is
done at most |D+
left| + |D+
right| + 2 times. From Lemma 2, given a set P ′ ∪{t′},
if an edge eP (s, t) of gk(Vl)+ is such that (P ′ ∪{t′}) \ Vl ⊂(st)+, then all the
successors of eP (s, t) verify the same inclusion. Furthermore, if eP ′′(s′′, t′′) is the
predecessor of an edge eP ′(s′, t′) of gk(Vr), then P ′′∪{t′′} = (P ′∪{t′})\{t′}∪{s′},
from Proposition 2. It follows that, for two consecutive passes in loop (2), the
considered sets (P ′ ∪{t′}) \ Vl diﬀer from each other by at most one point
and the test (P ′ ∪{t′}) \ Vl ̸⊂(st)+ can be achieved in constant time. It is
the same with all the other instructions in loop (2), which are all together in
O(|D+
left| + |D+
right|); hence the result.

Obviously, D+
right can be found in a symmetric way and it is the same with the
lines to remove on gk(Vl)−and gk(Vr)−. Hence the theorem:
Theorem 2. The edges to remove on gk(Vl) and gk(Vr) can be found in O(k +
d log k) time, where d is the total number of edges to remove.

Edge Construction
In the preceding section we have seen that the edges to remove form two con-
nected lines on the left and on the right k-set polygons. Since the k-set polygon
to construct is convex, the edges to create form also two connected lines, an
upper and a lower one (see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). We denote by Cupper the oriented
upper line to create and by Clower the lower line. Cupper connects the start vertex
of D+
right to the end vertex of D+
left (obtained by Algorithm 1).
We show now that the edges of Cupper can be found by considering k-set
polygons of at most 2k points of Vl ∪Vr.
Lemma 5. eP (s, t) is an edge of Cupper if and only if the k-element sets Tl and
Tr, which are //(st)-separable from Vl and Vr respectively, are such that:
– eP (s, t) is an edge of gk(Tl ∪Tr)+,
– g(Tl) is a vertex of D+
left and g(Tr) is a vertex of D+
right.
Proof. (i) If eP (s, t) is an edge of Cupper, P ∪{s, t} contains at least one point
u of Vl \ Vr (otherwise it would be an edge of gk(Vr)). If there were a point v
of Vr \ Tr in (st)−then, since there exists an oriented straight line Δ parallel
to (st) such that Tr is Δ-separable from Vr, we would have Δ ⊂(st)−and thus
Tr ⊂(st)−. Hence Tr ∪{u, v} ⊂(st)−. This is impossible, from Proposition
2, and thus Vr \ Tr ⊂(st)+. In the same way, Vl \ Tl ⊂(st)+. It follows that
P ∪{s, t} ⊆Tl ∪Tr and that eP (s, t) is an edge of gk(Tl ∪Tr). More precisely,
since eP (s, t) is an edge of gk(Vl ∪Vr)+, it is also an edge of gk(Tl ∪Tr)+.
Moreover, if g(Tr) is the leftmost vertex of gk(Vr), from Lemma 1, it belongs to
D+
right. Otherwise, from Lemma 4, the edge eP ′(s′, t′) of gk(Vr) with start vertex
g(Tr) is such that st <θs′t′. Then eP ′(s′, t′) cannot be an edge of gk(Vl ∪Vr)
since it should precede eP (s, t) on gk(Vl ∪Vr)+. It follows that g(Tr) is a vertex
of D+
right. In the same way, g(Tl) is a vertex of D+
left.
(ii) Conversely, let Tl and Tr be two k-element sets //Δ-separable from Vl and
Vr respectively (with a same straight line Δ) and such that gk(Tl ∪Tr)+ admits
an edge eP (s, t) parallel to Δ. Since |Tl| = k and |P| = k−1, at least one point of
Tl belongs to (st)+. It follows that if Δ′ is a straight line parallel to Δ such that
Tl is Δ′-separable from Vl, we have (st) ⊂Δ′−. Hence Vl \ Tl ⊂Δ′+ ⊂(st)+. In
the same way, Vr \ Tr ⊂(st)+. From Proposition 2, eP (s, t) is then an edge of
gk(Vl ∪Vr). Moreover, since eP (s, t) belongs to gk(Tl ∪Tr)+, it also belongs to
gk(Vl ∪Vr)+. Furthermore, since g(Tr) belongs to D+
right, every edge eP ′(s′, t′) of
gk(Vr)+ that belongs to gk(Vl ∪Vr) is such that s′t′ <θst. The same, since g(Tl)
belongs to D+
left, every edge eP ′′(s′′, t′′) of gk(Vl)+ that belongs to gk(Vl ∪Vr) is
such that st <θs′′t′′. It follows that eP (s, t) is an edge of Cupper.

It follows from this proposition that, to construct Cupper, we have to consider
all the couples of vertices (g(Tl), g(Tr)), where g(Tl) and g(Tr) belong to D+
left
and D+
right respectively and such that Tl and Tr are //Δ-separable from Vl and
Vr with a same straight line Δ. Then it suﬃces, for each of these couples, to
compute the k-set polygon of Tl ∪Tr and to extract some of its edges. We give
now an algorithm that generates these couples eﬃciently, by using the result of
Lemma 4.
If ePl(sl, tl) and eP ′
l (s′
l, t′
l) are the edges of gk(Vl)+ respectively starting and
ending in g(Tl) and if ePr(sr, tr) and eP ′r(s′
r, t′
r) are the edges of gk(Vr)+ re-
spectively starting and ending in g(Tr), we denote by θ(g(Tl), g(Tr)) the interval
[max(θ(s′
lt′
l), θ(s′
rt′
r)), min(θ(sltl), θ(srtr))].
We suppose that the upper line of any k-set polygon is completed with the
same two anchor-edges as in Algorithm 1.

Proposition 5. The algorithm constructs Cupper and can be implemented to run
in O((k + |D+
right| + |D+
left| + |Cupper|) log2 k) time.
Proof. (i) We ﬁrst show that the algorithm constructs Cupper. Since gk(Vl ∪Vr)+
is convex, the angles of the edges of Cupper with the x-axis belong to the inter-
val [θ(smin, tmin), θ(smax, tmax)]. Now, the intervals θ(g(Tl), g(Tr)) considered
www.ebook3000.com

174
W. El Oraiby and D. Schmitt
in loop (2) partition [θ(smin, tmin), θ(smax, tmax)]. It follows, from Lemmas 4
and 5, that the edges of Cupper are the edges eP (s, t) of gk(Tl ∪Tr)+ such that
θ(s, t) ∈θ(g(Tl), g(Tr)), for all couples (Tl, Tr) treated in loop (2). Moreover,
since the intervals θ(g(Tl), g(Tr)) are treated in increasing angular order, the
edges extracted from two consecutive k-set polygons gk(Tl ∪Tr) will appear
consecutively on Cupper.
In order to show that the algorithm works, it remains to prove that instruction
(3) is valid, that is, that g(T ) is really a vertex of the considered k-set polygon
gk(Tl ∪Tr) (even if none of its edges belongs to gk(Vl ∪Vr)+). By construction,
g(T ) is the end vertex of the already constructed part of Cupper. Denote now
by eP1(s1, t1) and eP2(s2, t2) the edges of gk(Vl ∪Vr)+ respectively ending and
starting in g(T ). On the one hand, Tl and Tr are such that, when instruction
(3) is executed, θ(s1t1) is smaller than the lower bound θmin of θ(g(Tl), g(Tr)),
since eP1(s1, t1) has been constructed before the couple (Tl, Tr) was considered.
On the other hand, θ(s2t2) is greater than θmin since eP2(s2, t2) has still to
be constructed. Let Δ be a straight line such that θ(Δ) ∈θ(g(Tl), g(Tr)) and
θ(Δ) < θ(s2t2) (Δ can always be chosen in such a way that it is not parallel
to any straight line passing through two points of V ). Since θ(s1t1) < θ(Δ) <
θ(s2t2), T is //Δ-separable from Vl ∪Vr, by Lemma 4. Let now g(T ′) be the
vertex of gk(Tl ∪Tr) such that T ′ is //Δ-separable from Tl ∪Tr. If Δ′ is the
oriented straight line parallel to Δ such that T ′ is Δ′-separable from Tl ∪Tr,
then the same reasoning as in proof of Lemma 5 shows that no point of Vl \ Tl
and of Vr \Tr belongs to Δ′−. It follows that g(T ′) is also a vertex of gk(Vl ∪Vr).
More precisely, g(T ′) is the vertex of gk(Vl ∪Vr)+ such that T ′ is //Δ-separable
from Vl ∪Vr, that is, g(T ′) = g(T ). Hence, g(T ) is really a vertex of gk(Tl ∪Tr).
(ii) The essential step of the algorithm, given a vertex g(T ) of gk(Tl ∪Tr), is
to determine the edge eP (s, t) of gk(Tl ∪Tr) starting at g(T ). If the convex hulls
of T and (Tl ∪Tr) \ T are given, it suﬃces to ﬁnd the common oriented tangent
Δ of these convex hulls such that T ⊂Δ−, (Tl ∪Tr) \ T ⊂Δ+, and s = T ∩Δ
precedes t = ((Tl ∪Tr) \ T ) ∩Δ on Δ. Indeed, from Proposition 2, eT \{s}(s, t)
is then the edge of gk(Tl ∪Tr) starting at g(T ). We have thus to maintain the
convex hulls of T and of (Tl ∪Tr) \ T all along the algorithm.
At the beginning of the algorithm, g(T ) = g(Tr) is the start vertex of D+
right.
The convex hull of T can then be obtained in the following way: If g(T ′) is the
leftmost vertex of gk(Vr), the convex hull of T ′ can be directly computed since
the points of T ′ are stored in the data structure containing gk(Vr). Let CH be
the data structure containing this convex hull. D+
right can then be traversed from
g(T ′) to g(T ) and, for each traversed edge eP (s, t), t is removed from CH and s is
inserted in CH. When arriving in g(T ), CH contains the convex hull of T . Using
the fully dynamic convex hull data structure of Overmars and van Leeuwen [8],
the convex hull of T ′ can be stored in CH in O(k log2 k) time and every insertion
or deletion in CH can be done in O(log2 k) time (the same operations can be
achived in O(log k) amortized time with the data structure of [3]). The convex
hull of the set T at the beginning of the algorithm can thus be obtained in
O((k + |D+
right|) log2 k) time. Since, at the beginning of the algorithm, T = Tr,

Divide and Conquer Method for k-Set Polygons
175
the convex hull of (Tl ∪Tr) \ T = Tl \ T can be computed in the same way (in
a dynamic structure CH′) while traversing D+
left in loop (1). In order to place
in CH′ only the points of Tl that are not in T , it suﬃces to mark the points of
T (for example, while constructing their convex hull). During the execution of
the algorithm, the set T is only modiﬁed by instruction (5). To update CH, we
have just to remove s and to insert t. Since instruction (5) happens exactly once
per edge created on Cupper, the overall complexity of all the updates of CH is
O(|Cupper| log2 k). The set (Tl ∪Tr)\T is modiﬁed by instructions (5) and (6). In
the same way, for each of these instructions, at most one point is removed from
CH′ and at most one point is inserted (a point that already belongs to CH is
neither removed nor inserted in CH′). Since the total number of passes in loop
(2) is at most |D+
right| + |D+
left| and since the total number of passes in loop (4)
is equal to the number of edges of Cupper, it follows that the overall complexity
of the updates of CH′ is O((|D+
right|+|D+
left|+|Cupper|) log2 k). Since a common
tangent of T and (Tl ∪Tr) \ T can also be found in O(log2 k) time using CH
and CH′, Cupper can be constructed in O((k +|D+
right|+|D+
left|+|Cupper|) log2 k)
time.
⊓⊔
Obviously, the lower polygonal line can be constructed similarly and we get the
following result:
Theorem 3. The edges to construct while merging gk(Vl) and gk(Vr) can be
found in O((k + d + c) log2 k) time, where d and c are the numbers of edges to
delete and to create.
The divide and conquer construction of the k-set polygon of a set V of at least
k points is then as follows:

Proof. If n ≤k + 1, the algorithm directly constructs the k-set polygon of V .
If n = k, this k-set polygon is reduced to the centroid g(V ). If n = k + 1, from

Proposition 1, a vertex of the k-set polygon of V is the centroid of a subset of
k points of V separable from the last one by a straight line. This last point is
then a vertex of the convex hull of V and it follows that constructing the k-set
polygon of V comes to constructing its convex hull. This can be done in O(k)
time since V is sorted.
If n > k + 1, V is divided into two subsets Vl and Vr such that |Vl| = ⌈n/2⌉
and |Vr| = ⌊n/2⌋if n ≥2(k + 1), and |Vl| ≤k + 1 and |Vr| ≤k + 1 otherwise.
The k-set polygons of Vl and Vr are then recursively constructed and, ﬁnally,
merged with Algorithms 1 and 2 in O((k + d + c) log2 k) time, where d and c are
the total numbers of edges deleted and constructed in the merging step.
Now, Dey [5] and T´oth [10] have shown that the size of a k-set polygon
of n points is in O(nβ(k)), with 2Ω(√log k) ≤β(k) ≤O(k1/3). It follows that
d and c are bounded by O(nβ(k)) and that the complexity of the merging is
O(nβ(k) log2 k). Hence the induction relation that gives the complexity T (n) of
the algorithm (without the sorting step):
T (n) ≤T (⌈n/2⌉) + T (⌊n/2⌋) + O(nβ(k) log2 k)
if n ≥2(k + 1)
T (n) ≤2T (k + 1) + O(nβ(k) log2 k)
if k + 1 < n < 2(k + 1)
T (n) = O(k)
if n ≤k + 1
Solving this relation, we get T (n) = O(nβ(k) log2 k log(n/k)). Thus, the over-
all complexity of Algorithm 3, including sorting, is O(n log n+m log2 k log(n/k)),
where m = O(nβ(k)) is the worst case size of a k-set polygon of n points.
⊓⊔

Conclusion
In this paper we have applied a classical algorithmic method to the construction
of k-set polygons in the plane: The divide and conquer method. To this aim we
have characterized the edges that are removed and the ones that are created
when two k-set polygons are merged.
In the worst-case time complexity of the ﬁnal divide and conquer algorithm
appears an additional log(n/k) factor, in comparison with the algorithm of [4].
We suspect that this factor comes from over-estimates in the complexity com-
putation. Indeed, in this computation, we suppose that the number of edges
removed and created at each merging step is linear with the worst case sizes
of the merged k-set polygons. Applied to the recursive convex hull construction
(i.e. for k = 1), this way of computing leads to a total number of O(n log n)
created edges whereas it is well known that this algorithm only constructs O(n)
edges in all.
The aim now is to ﬁnd a ﬁner analysis method of our algorithm to remove the
log(n/k) factor. A second aim is to extend other classical convex hull algorithms
to the construction of k-set polygons and namely the Quick-Hull algorithm in or-
der to check if its good practical performances hold for k-set polygon construction.

Abstract. For every k and r, we construct a ﬁnite family of axis-parallel
rectangles in the plane such that no matter how we color them with k
colors, there exists a point covered by precisely r members of the family,
all of which have the same color. For r = 2, this answers a question of
S. Smorodinsky [S06].

Introduction
Given a set of points P and a family of regions R in the plane, in a natural way
one can associate two hypergraphs with them, dual to each other. Let H(P, R)
denote the hypergraph on the vertex set P, whose hyperedges are all subsets of
P that can be obtained by intersecting P with a member of R. The hypergraph
H∗(P, R) is deﬁned by swapping the roles of R and P: its vertex set is R, and
for each p ∈P it has a hyperedge consisting of all regions in R that contain p.
Let H be a hypergraph with vertex set V (H). The chromatic number χ(H) of
H is the smallest number of colors in a coloring of V (H) such that no hyperedge
with at least two vertices is monochromatic. Let Hr (and H≥r) denote the hy-
pergraph on the vertex set V (H), consisting of all r-element (at least r-element)
hyperedges of H. By deﬁnition, we have χ(H) = χ(H≥2).
In the special case when R is the family of all axis-parallel rectangles and P
is a set of n points in the plane, the problem of bounding χ(H(P, R)) reduces to
estimating the chromatic number of the graph G(P, R) := H2(P, R) consisting
of all two-element (hyper)edges of H(P, R). Kˇr´ıˇz and Neˇsetˇril [KN91] gave an
explicit construction showing that the chromatic number of G(P, R) cannot be
bounded by an absolute constant. Chen, Pach, Szegedy, and Tardos [CPST07]
proved by a probabilistic argument that there exist n-element point sets P such
that the chromatic numbers of G(P, R) grow as fast as at least Ω

It was also shown in [CPST07] that, for a ﬁxed r ≥2, a randomly and
uniformly selected set P of n points in the unit square almost surely satisﬁes
χ(Hr(P, R) = Ω

log1/(r−1) n

,
as n tends to inﬁnity.
Concerning the dual question, S. Smorodinsky [S06] proved that if R is a
family of n open axis-parallel rectangles and P is a set of points in the plane,
then χ(H∗(P, R)) = O(log n). In other words, the rectangles in R can be colored
by at most constant times log n colors so that, for any point p ∈P covered by
more than one rectangle, at least two rectangles containing p have diﬀerent
colors. Smorodinsky asked whether there always exists such a coloring with a
bounded number of colors. In the present note, we answer this question in the
negative, in the following stronger form
Theorem 1. Let n ≥r ≥2 be integers. There exists a family R of n axis-
parallel rectangles in the plane such that for any coloring of the rectangles with
k ≤C log n
r log r colors, one can ﬁnd a point covered by exactly r members of R, all
of the same color. Here C > 0 is an absolute constant.
Using our notation, we have that χ(H∗
r (P, R)) ≥C log n
r log r, where P = R2 (or a
suitable ﬁnite subset of R2). For r = 2, the above mentioned result of Smorodin-
sky [S06] shows that Theorem 1 is not far from being optimal.
A family of axis-parallel rectangles is said to form a r-fold covering of the
plane if every point p ∈R2 is contained in at least r members of the family. It is
called locally ﬁnite if no point of the plane belongs to inﬁnitely many rectangles.
We say that a covering has a k-split if the family can be partitioned into k parts
such that the union of any k −1 parts form a (1-fold) covering. Theorem 1 yields
Corollary 1. For every r, k ≥2, there is a locally ﬁnite r-fold covering of the
plane with axis-parallel rectangles that does not have a k-split.
In the case k = 2, Corollary 1 states that there are locally ﬁnite r-fold coverings
of the plane with axis-parallel rectangles that cannot be partitioned into two cov-
erings. A very simple direct construction proving this can be found in [PTT07].
Some positive results with half-planes, disks, translates of a convex polygon,
etc., in the place of rectangles, were established in [P80], [MP87], [P86], [TT07],
[K07], and [ACCLS07]. There is an intimate relationship between questions of
this type and the notion of conﬂict-free colorings, introduced by Even, Lotker,
Ron, and Smorodinsky [ELRS03]; see also [HS05]. Many similar problems on
colorings are discussed in [BMP05] and [MP06].

The Construction and its Basic Properties
First we have to introduce some notations.
For any two integers c ≥2 and k ≥0, let [c] := {0, 1, . . ., c −1} and let
[c]k stand for the set of strings of length k over the alphabet [c]. For x ∈[c]k,
let xj denote the jth digit of x (1 ≤j ≤k), so that we have x = x1 . . . xk.
www.ebook3000.com

J. Pach and G. Tardos
Let ←−x denote the reverse of x, that is, ←−x = xk . . . x1. An initial segment of x is
a string x1 . . . xj for some 0 ≤j ≤k. Expanding x as a c-ary fraction, we obtain
a number x := k
j=1 xj/cj.
Let c ≥2 and d ≥1 be integers. For any 0 ≤k ≤d, u ∈[c]k, and v ∈[c]d−k,
deﬁne an open axis-parallel rectangle Rk
u,v in the plane as follows:
Rk
u,v := (u, u + c−k) × (v, v + ck−d).
Now we are in a position to deﬁne the family of rectangles R meeting the
requirements of Theorem 1. Let R consist of the rectangles in
	
Rk
u,v | 0 < k < d, u ∈[c]k, v ∈[c]d−k, uk = vd−k

together with the rectangles in
	
R0
ε,v | v ∈[c]d, vd = 0

∪
	
Rd
u,ε | u ∈[c]d, ud = 0

,
where ε stands for the empty string and ε = 0. For convenience, we slightly
change the notation. For any z ∈[c]d−1, 0 < k < d, set Sk
z := Rk
u,v, where u is
the initial segment of z of length k, and v is the initial segment of ←−z of length
d −k. Further, for any z ∈[c]d−1, set S0
z := R0
ε,v and Sd
z := Rd
u,ε, where u is
obtained from z by appending to it a 0 as its last digit, and v is obtained from
←−z in the same way. Using this notation, we have
R = R(c, d) = {Sk
z | 0 ≤k ≤d, z ∈[c]d−1}.
Clearly, we have |R| = (d+1)cd−1. Finally, let H∗= H∗(c, d) = H∗(R2, R(c, d))
denote the hypergraph on the vertex set R = R(c, d), whose hyperedges are all
nonempty subsets of S ⊆R for which there is a point in the plane covered by
the elements of S, but by no other element of R.
The most important property of our construction is the following.
Theorem 2. Let d > 0, 2 ≤r < c, and let H∗= H∗(c, d) denote the hypergraph
deﬁned above. If a subset I ⊆R(c, d) contains no hyperedge of H∗of size r, then
we have
|I| ≤
cd−1
1
r−1 −
1
c−1
.
Let G∗:= G∗(c, d) denote the graph H∗
2, consisting of all two-element hyperedges
of H∗= H∗(c, d). In view of Theorem 2, the chromatic number χ(H∗(c, d))
satisﬁes the following.
Corollary 2. (1) The graph G∗(2, d) is bipartite.
(2) The chromatic number of G∗(3, d) is at least d+1
2 .
(3) For c ≥d + 3, the chromatic number of G∗(c, d) is d + 1.
Proof. To establish (1), color the rectangles Sk
z ∈R(2, d) according to the parity
of k + d
i=1 zi. Clearly, this is a proper coloring of the vertex set of G∗(2, d).

Coloring Axis-Parallel Rectangles
181
Applying Theorem 2 with r = 2, we obtain that the size of every independent
set in G∗(c, d) is at most cd−1/(1 −1/(c −1)). As the total number of vertices
of G∗(c, d) is (d + 1)cd−1, the chromatic number of G∗(c, d) is at least (d + 1)
(1 −1/(c −1)). In case c = 3, this gives the bound claimed in (2). For c ≥d + 3,
we have (d + 1)(1 −1/(c −1)) > d, so that χ(G∗(c, d)) ≥d + 1. This is tight,
since the vertices Sk
z ∈V (G∗(c, d)) = R(c, d) can be colored according to the
value k, 0 ≤k ≤d.
2
Theorem 1 immediately follows from
Corollary 3. Let k, r ≥2 be ﬁxed. There exists a family of k(2r)2kr axis-parallel
rectangles in the plane such that for any coloring of these rectangles with k colors,
one can ﬁnd a point covered by exactly r rectangles, all of which have the same
color.
Proof. Consider the family R(c, d) with c = 2r, d = 2kr −1. For any k-coloring
of the members of R(c, d) = R(2r, 2kr −1), the size of the largest color class is at
least (d + 1)cd−1/k = cd, which is larger than the bound in Theorem 2. Thus, the
largest color class contains a hyperedge of H∗(c, d) of size r. Note that the slightly
smaller choices c = 2r −1, d = 2kr −2k would also suﬃce for the proof.
2
It remains to establish Theorem 2.
3
Proof of Theorem 2
Let d ≥1 and c ≥2 be ﬁxed. Let R = R(c, d) denote the family of all rectangles
Rk
u,v with 0 ≤k ≤d, u ∈[c]k, v ∈[c]d−k. Let H
∗= H
∗(c, d) be the correspond-
ing hypergraph, that is, let the vertices of H
∗be the members of R, and let its
hyperedges be all sets of the form {R ∈R | p ∈R}, where p ∈R2.
First we study the structure of H
∗. We deﬁne Rk
u,v ≤Rl
w,z if k ≤l, u is an
initial segment of w, and z is an initial segment of v. Note that ≤is a partial
order on R. We show that the hyperedges of H
∗form intervals in this partial
order.
Lemma 1. The hyperedges of H
∗are exactly the sets {e ∈R | a ≤e ≤b},
where a ≤b are elements of R.
Proof. Let a = Rk
u,v and b = Rl
w,z be two elements of R with a ≤b. Let pa,b =
(w+c−l−1, v+ck−d−1), a point of the plane. Let e = Rm
x,y ∈R arbitrary. We have
e = (x, x+c−m)×(y, y+cm−d). So pa,b ∈e if and only if x < w+c−l−1 < x+c−m
and y < v + ck−d−1 < y + cm−d. The ﬁrst pair of inequalities is satisﬁed if and
only if m ≤l and x is an initial segment of w, while the second pair is satisﬁed
if and only if k ≤m and y is an initial segment of v. Both pairs are satisﬁed if
and only if a ≤e ≤b. Therefore, the point pa,b shows that {e ∈R | a ≤e ≤b}
is an edge of H
∗.
To see that H
∗has no additional hyperedges, it is suﬃcient to prove the
following two claims.
www.ebook3000.com

182
J. Pach and G. Tardos
(1) Any two rectangles a, b ∈R are disjoint, unless a ≤b or b ≤a.
(2) For any three rectangles a ≤e ≤b, we have a ∩b ⊆e.
Here (1) shows that the vertices of any hyperedge of H
∗are linearly ordered by
≤. If a is the minimal vertex of a hyperedge f and b is its maximal vertex, then
f ⊆{e ∈R | a ≤e ≤b}, and by (2) equality must hold.
To verify (1), let a = Rk
u,v = a1 × a2 and b = Rl
w,z = b1 × b2. Here a1, a2,
b1, and b2 are open intervals. We may assume k ≤l, by symmetry. If for some
i ≤k we have ui ̸= wi, then a1 and b1 are disjoint. If for some i ≤d −l, we have
vi ̸= zi, then a2 and b2 are disjoint. So if a and b intersect, we must have a ≤b.
Notice that in this case we have b1 ⊆a1 and a2 ⊆b2.
To verify (2), let a ≤e ≤b with a = a1 × a2 and b = b1 × b2. Using the last
observation of the previous paragraph, we have a ∩b = b1 × a2 and by the same
observation again, this is contained in e.
2
The type of a rectangle Rk
u,v ∈R is k. It is easy to see that if a ≤b are rectangles
in R of type k and l, respectively, then for all k ≤m ≤l, there exists precisely
one d ∈R of type m that satisﬁes a ≤d ≤b. Consider now the two-coloring of
R, where the color of a rectangle is determined by the parity of its type. The
last observation shows that in any hyperedge of H
∗the number of vertices of
the two color classes diﬀer by at most one. In particular, no edge of size at least
two is monochromatic.
Next we describe the structure of the subfamily R = R(c, d) of R. The ele-
ments of R are partially ordered by ≤. Note that for any a = Sk
z and b = Sl
t, we
have a ≤b if and only if k ≤l and zi = ti for all 1 ≤i ≤k and l ≤i ≤d −1.
For any a ≤b in R(c, d), we deﬁne the interval [a, b] = {e ∈R | a ≤e ≤b}. For
any a = Sk
z and b = Sl
t with a ≤b, the interval [a, b] contains one element of
type m for each index m such that k ≤m ≤l and zm = tm. Here the type of
the rectangle Sm
w (inherited from R) is m.
Corollary 4. The hyperedges of H∗(c, d) are exactly the intervals [a, b], where
a ≤b are vertices of H∗(c, d).
Proof. The hyperedges of H∗(c, d) are the sets e ∩R where e is a hyperedge of
H
∗(c, d). The assertion follows from Lemma 1.
2
Corollary 5. Two vertices Sk
z and Sl
t are connected in G∗(c, d) by an edge if
and only if
(1) k ̸= l,
(2) for all indices i strictly between k and l, we have zi ̸= ti, and
(3) for all other indices i, we have zi = ti.
2
Proof of Theorem 2. Let us ﬁx d ≥1, 2 ≤r < c and a set I ⊆R = R(c, d)
such that no edge of H∗(c, d) of size r is contained in I. For any vertex a ∈R
of type 0 ≤i < d, we deﬁne the next vertex N(a) of type i + 1 as follows. Let
N(Si
x) = Si+1
x
if i = 0 or Si
x ∈I. If 0 < i < d and Si
x /∈I, then let N(Si
x) = Si+1
y
,
where yj = xj for all indices 1 ≤j ≤d −1, j ̸= i, and yi = (xi + s) mod c. We

Coloring Axis-Parallel Rectangles
183
choose s to be the smallest positive integer such that Si
y /∈I. In other words,
we obtain y from x by shifting the ith digit cyclically upward until we reach a
value y with Si
y /∈I. Note that the choice s = c makes y = x and Si
y /∈I. We
call the vertex Si
x bad if s = c is the minimal choice, that is, if 1 ≤i ≤d −1,
Si
x /∈I and N(Si
x) = Si+1
x
. Clearly, Si
x is bad if and only if Si
x /∈I but Si
y ∈I
for all the c −1 strings y that diﬀer from x only at the position i. Therefore, for
the set B of bad vertices, we have |B| ≤|I|/(c −1) .
It is easy to see that for 0 ≤i ≤d −1, the function N : R(c, d) →R(c, d) is
a one-to-one mapping from the vertices of type i to the vertices of type i + 1.
We call a sequence a0, a1, . . . , ad of vertices of R a cluster if N(ai) = ai+1 for
0 ≤i ≤d −1. Note that ai is of type i for every i. There are cd−1 clusters (one
for each a0 of type 0) and they form a partition of R into subsets of size d + 1.
The main observation is the following. If in a cluster a0, a1, . . . , ad we have
ai, aj ∈I for some indices 0 ≤i ≤j ≤d, then ai ≤aj and [ai, aj] = {ak | i ≤
k ≤j, ak ∈I ∪B}. This follows readily from the deﬁnition of the relation ≤.
Now we use that intervals like [ai, aj] are edges of the hypergraph H∗(c, d)
(Corollary 4), and no edge of size r is contained in I. Therefore, a cluster contains
at most r −1 elements of I not separated by bad vertices. If there are b bad
vertices in a cluster, then the cluster contains at most (r −1)(b + 1) elements
of I. Summing over all clusters, we conclude that
|I| ≤(r −1)|B| + (r −1)cd−1.
Using the inequality |B| ≤|I|/(c −1) and rearranging the terms, the desired
bound on |I| follows.

Concluding Remarks
For any c ≥2, d ≥1, deﬁne a graph G′ = G′(c, d) on the vertex set {vk
z | 0 ≤
k ≤d, z ∈[c]d} as follows. Connect two vertices vk
z and vl
t with k ≤l by an edge
if and only if
(1) k < l,
(2) for all indices i with k < i ≤l, we have zi ̸= ti, and
(3) for all other indices i, we have zi = ti.
Clearly, the deﬁnition of G′(c, d) is very close to the description of G∗(c, d) given
in Corollary 5. Let us compare the two graphs.
It is easy to see that G′ contains a complete graph on d + 1 vertices. For
example, let z(i) be a string of i zeros followed by d −i ones. Notice that the
vertices vi
z(i), 0 ≤i ≤d, form a complete subgraph. Thus, the chromatic number
of G′ is at least d+1, and this is tight, as shown by the coloring that assigns color
i to all vertices of the form vi
z. Moreover, the vertex set of G′ can be partitioned
into (d + 1)-element sets so that each set induces a complete graph in G′. To see
this, let x = x1 . . . xd ∈[c]d, and for any 0 ≤i ≤d, deﬁne x(i) ∈[c]d as follows:
let (x(i))j = xj if j > i, and let (x(i))j = (xj + 1) mod c if j ≤i. Clearly, the
vertices vi
x(i) induce a complete subgraph in G′, and for the diﬀerent choices of x,

they form a vertex partition. This shows that no independent set in G′ contains
more than a fraction of 1/(d + 1) of the vertices.
On the other hand, the graph G∗is triangle-free. To verify this, consider three
vertices a = Sk
z , b = Sl
t, and e = Sm
w with k ≤l ≤m. If a and b are connected by
an edge in G∗, we have k < l and zl = tl. Analogously, if b and e are connected,
then l < m and tl = wl. This yields that k < l < m and zl = wl, which implies
that a and e are not connected. Despite this diﬀerence, the proof of Theorem 2
was inspired by the similarity between G∗and G′, and by the simple argument
above, which provides an upper bound on the size of the largest independent set
in G′.
The fact that G∗is triangle-free is not merely a coincidence. Consider any
family S of axis-parallel rectangles in the plane, and construct a graph G =
(V, E) on the vertex set V = S by connecting two rectangles if they have a
point in common that is not covered by any other member of S. Recall that G∗
was also constructed in this manner. While G may contain triangles and even
subgraphs isomorphic to K4, it cannot have a complete subgraph on ﬁve vertices.
Furthermore, we can partition the edge set of G into two subsets E = E1 ∪E2 as
follows. Let us put an edge {v1, v2} ∈E in E1 if the boundaries of the rectangles
v1 and v2 cross in four points. Otherwise, put the edge {v1, v2} in E2. It is easy
to see that G1 := (V, E1) is triangle-free. It seems that G1 is the interesting
part of G, as the chromatic number of the graph G2 := (V, E2) is small. Perhaps
G2 is even Δ-degenerate for an appropriate absolute constant Δ, that is, every
subgraph of G2 has a vertex of degree at most Δ. To prove this, it would be
suﬃcient to show that |E2| ≤Δ|V |/2.

Abstract. We prove that connected cubic graphs of order n and girth
g have domination number at most 0.32127n + O
“

.
The domination number γ(G) of a (ﬁnite, undirected and simple) graph G =
(V, E) is one of the most well-studied graph parameters [4] and is deﬁned as the
minimum cardinality of a set D ⊆V of vertices such that every vertex in V \ D
has a neighbour in D.
Initially motivated by Reed’s [10] disproved [6] conjecture that every con-
nected cubic graph of order n has domination number at most ⌈n
3 ⌉, several
authors recently studied the domination number of cubic graphs of large girth
where the girth is the length of a shortest cycle in G.

for every cubic graph of order n and girth g ≥5. In the present
paper we will slightly improve the constant in this upper bound.
Since for ﬁxed d and g the numbers of cycles in random cubic graphs of ﬁxed
lengths r < g are asymptotically distributed as independent Poisson variables
[2] with mean (d −1)r/2r, the number of cycles in a random cubic graph of
length smaller than g is asymptotically almost surely bounded. Therefore, the
asymptotic bounds for the domination number of random cubic graphs carry over
to cubic graph of large girth and indicate how much more the above constant
could be improved. Molloy and Reed [9] proved that the domination number
γ of a random cubic graph of order n asymptotically almost surely satisﬁes
0.2636n ≤γ ≤0.3126n and Duckworth and Wormald [3] improved the upper
bound to 0.2794n.
We immediately proceed to our main result.

Domination in Cubic Graphs of Large Girth

Theorem 1. If G = (V, E) is a connected, cubic graph of order n, girth g and

vertices. Therefore, for some set S ⊆V let q1(S)
denote the number of components of G[V \ S] of odd order that are joined to S
by only one edge and let q2(S) denote the number of components of G[V \ S]
of odd order that are joined to S by at least 2 edges. Since G is cubic, all of
the q2(G) odd components are joined to S by at least 3 edges and we have
q2(G) ≤|S|. Furthermore, every component of G[V \ S] of odd order that is
joined S by only one edge must contain a cycle which implies that it has order
at least g and q1(S) ≤n
g . Altogether, we obtain q1(S) + q2(S) −|S| ≤n
g and by
the Tutte-Berge formula, there is a matching M in G such that the set D0 of
vertices not incident to an edge in M satisﬁes |D0| ≤n
g .
Since there are at most 3|D0| ≤3n
g edges between D0 and V \ D0, the graph
G[V \ D0] −M consists of cycles and at most 3n
2g paths. Let G[V \ D0] −M
contain k1 cycles and (k −k1) components which are paths of order more than
g
3. Note that the cycles are all of order at least g. Let the orders of these k cycles
and long paths be n1, n2, . . . , nk > g
3. Clearly, n1 +n2+· · ·+nk ≤n and k ≤3n
g .
If we decompose each of these k cycles and long paths into paths of length ⌊g

Since g

by more than one edge.
Let H denote the graph with vertex set V \ D0 whose edges are the edges
of the paths in P together with the matching M. Note that M is a perfect
matching of H. We will describe a probabilistic procedure for constructing a
small dominating set D1 of H in ﬁve phases.
Phase 1
We select a random subset P0 of P by assigning each P ∈P to P0 independently
at random with probability p for some 0 ≤p ≤1 to be speciﬁed later. Let
P1 = P \ P0.
Phase 2
For every path P : x1x2 . . . xl ∈P0 we choose independently at random a parity

j ∈{0, 1, 2} each with probability 1
3 and set
D(P) = {xi | 1 ≤i ≤l, i ≡j (mod 3)}.
Phase 3
For every path P : x1x2 . . . xl ∈P1 we will determine a set D(P) ⊆{x1, x2, . . . , xl}
by the following procedure:
(1) We set D(P) := ∅and i := 1.
(2) We query whether xi is adjacent in H to a vertex in 	
Q∈P0 D(Q).
– If the answer to the query is ‘yes’ and i ≤l −1,
then we set i := i + 1 and go to (2).
– If the answer to the query is ‘yes’ and i = l,
then we terminate.
– If the answer to the query is ‘no’ and i ≤l −3,
then we set D(P) := D(P) ∪{xi+1}, i := i + 3 and go to (2).
– If the answer to the query is ‘no’ and i ≥l −2,
then we set D(P) := D(P) ∪

xmin{i+1,l}

and terminate.
Phase 4
For every edge uv ∈M such that u ∈D(P), v ∈D(Q) with P, Q ∈P0 we delete
at most one vertex, say u, from D(P) ∪D(Q), if the neighbour(s) of u on P are
adjacent in H to a vertex in 	
R∈P0 D(R) \ D(P). (Note that in H the vertex u
has no neighbour on a path in P1.)
Phase 5
Let D′ denote the set of endvertices of the paths in P0 and let D1 = D′ ∪
	
P ∈P D(P). This terminates the last phase.
It is obvious from the construction that the set D1 is a dominating set of H. We
will now estimate the expected value of |D1|. Therefore, let n1 = n −|D0|.
The expected number of vertices added to 	
P ∈P0 D(P) in the Phase 2 is pn1
3 ,
because the probability that a path in P is in P0 is p and subject to this the
probability of a vertex on P to belong to D(P) is 1
3.
Now we proceed to the Phase 3. For some path P : x1x2 . . . xl in P1 let q
denote the total number of queries and let qy denote the number of queries with
answer ‘yes’ during the construction of D(P). Note that while the answers to
previous queries inﬂuence for which vertex we ask the next query, the answer to
every query is independent of the answers to previous queries, because no two
paths are joined by more than one edge and the random choices for diﬀerent
paths are independent.
If we query the corresponding adjacency for some vertex, then the path Q
containing its neighbour outside of P lies in P0 with probability p and subject to
this the neighbour lies in D(Q) with probability 1/3. Therefore, the probability
of a positive answer to an individual query is p/3 and the expected values for qy
and q satisfy E[qy] = pE[q]

.

Since with the exception of queries within distance O(1) of the end of P, for
every positive anser to a query the index i is incremented by 1 and for every
negative anser to a query the index i is incremented by 3, we have q = l+2qy

O (1). Therefore, E[q] =
l+2E[qy]
3
+ O (1) which together with E[qy] =
pE[q]
3
implies that E[q] =
3
9−2pl + O(1).
Since for every query with a negative answer, one vertex is added to D(P) we
have
E[|D(P)|] = E[q −qy] = E[q] −E[qy] = (1 −p/3)E[q] = 3 −p
9 −2pl + O(1).
Finally, since every of the O

Abstract. The Chv´atal–Erd˝os Theorem states that a 2-connected graph
is hamiltonian if its independence number is bounded from above by its
connectivity. In this short survey, we explore the recent development on
the extensions and the variants of this theorem.
1
Introduction
Hamiltonian cycles in graphs have been one of the central topics in graph the-
ory. From a computational point of view, to check whether a given graph is
hamiltonian is an NP-complete problem. Therefore, it seems to be impossible
to obtain a criterion for a graph to be hamiltonian which implies a polynomial-
time algorithm. Thus, the main focus has been taken on suﬃcient conditions for
hamiltonicity. We believe that the more suﬃcient conditions we ﬁnd, the deeper
insight we have on the structure of hamiltonian graphs.
Probably, one of the most famous suﬃcient conditions for hamiltonicity is
Ore’s Theorem. For a vertex x in a graph G, let degG x denote the degree of x
in G.
Theorem 1 (Ore’s Theorem [28]). Let G be a graph of order n ≥3. If
degG x + degG y ≥n holds for every pair of nonadjacent vertices x and y in G,
then G is hamiltonian.
Since [28], many results have been obtained on the relationship between hamil-
tonicity and degrees of graphs. These results give so-called “degree conditions”,
which generally claim that a graph is hamiltonian if the degree of almost every
vertex is large. For general hamiltonian problems including degree conditions,
we refer the reader to the excellent surveys by Gould [17] and [19].
In 1972, Chv´atal and Erd˝os gave a suﬃcient condition for a graph to be
hamiltonian. For a graph G, let α(G) and κ(G) denote the independence number
and the connectivity of G, respectively.

Theorem 2 (The Chv´atal–Erd˝os Theorem [8]). Every 2-connected graph
G with α(G) ≤κ(G) is hamiltonian.
The Chv´atal–Erd˝os Theorem has a number of unique aspects. For example, it
is not a “degree condition”, in the sense that the degree does not appear in
the statement. On the other hand, as Bondy remarked in [3], it implies Ore’s
Theorem.
Theorem 3 ([3]). If a graph G of order n ≥3 satisﬁes degG x + degG y ≥n
for every pair of nonadjacent vertices x and y in G, then G is 2-connected and
α(G) ≤κ(G).
The Chv´atal–Erd˝os Theorem has opened a new vista in the research of hamil-
tonian graphs. Since [8], there have been obtained a large number of suﬃcient
conditions for a graph to satisfy a certain cycle-related or path-related prop-
erty, which are mainly described in terms of the independence number and the
connectivity. We call them “Chv´atal–Erd˝os conditions”. Jackson and Ordaz [20]
published an excellent survey on Chv´atal–Erd˝os conditions.
The purpose of this paper is to give an overview of the recent progress in the
research of Chv´atal–Erd˝os conditions. We mainly discuss the results which have
been obtained since [20] was published and give an update to the status of the
research. We also deal with several topics not addressed in [20].
2
Pancyclicity
A graph of order n ≥3 is said to be pancyclic if it contains a cycle of ev-
ery length between three and n. Many degree conditions for hamiltonicity have
been extended to suﬃcient conditions for a graph to be pancyclic. For example,
Bondy [2] extended Ore’s Theorem in the following way.
Theorem 4 ([2]). A hamiltonian graph of order n with at least 1
4n2 edges is
either pancyclic or the balanced complete bipartite graph. In particular, if G sat-
isﬁes the assumption of Ore’s Theorem, then G is either pancyclic or a balanced
complete bipartite graph.
On the other hand, the extension of The Chv´atal–Erd˝os Theorem to pancyclicity
has so far been of little success. In particular, the following natural conjecture,
made by Jackson and Ordaz [20] is still open.
Conjecture 1 ([20]). Every graph G with α(G) < κ(G) is pancyclic.
Amar, Fournier and Germa [1] investigated the distribution of the lengths of
cycles in a 2-connected graph G with α(G) ≤κ(G). They made one conjecture,
which was later proved by Lou [23].
Theorem 5 ([23]). A 2-connected triangle-free graph G of order n with α(G) ≤
κ(G) has a cycle of every length between four and n unless G is a balanced
complete bipartite graph or C5.

Chv´atal–Erd˝os Theorem: Old Theorem with New Aspects
193
Flandrin et al. [13] have proved that Conjecture 1 holds if the order of the graph
is bounded from below by a function of the independence number.
Theorem 6 ([13]). A 2-connected graph G of order n with α(G) = α and
κ(G) = κ is pancyclic if α ≤κ and n ≥2 · r(4α, α + 1), where r(m, n) is the
Ramsey number.
Theorem 6 is a nice step toward Conjecture 1. However, we cannot simply say
that it solves the conjecture for suﬃciently large graphs since the lower bound
of the order is not a constant.
3
Cycle Covering
Let C1, . . . , Cm be cycles in a graph G. Then we say that C1, . . . , Cm cover G if
V (G) = m
i=1 V (Ci). Note that we do not require C1, . . . , Cm to be disjoint. In
other words, C1, . . . , Cm may not form a 2-factor of G.
By the deﬁnition, G is hamiltonian if and only if G is covered by one cycle.
This interpretation leads us to consider a suﬃcient condition for a graph to
be covered by a speciﬁed number of cycles. Kouider [22] proved the following
beautiful extension of the Chv´atal–Erd˝os Theorem, which was ﬁrst conjectured
by Fournier [15].
Theorem 7 ([22]). Every 2-connected graph G with α(G) = α and κ(G) = κ
is covered by ⌈α/κ⌉cycles.
We see that the number ⌈α/κ⌉of cycles to cover G is sharp by considering
complete bipartite graphs.
4
Long Cycles
For a graph G with at least one cycle, the length of a longest cycle in G is
called the circumference of G, and is denoted by circ(G). A graph G of order
n is hamiltonian if and only if circ(G) = n. If a graph G does not satisfy a
suﬃcient condition for hamiltonicity, we cannot guarantee the existence of a
hamiltonian cycle. But if G is close to satisfying the condition, we may hope
to ﬁnd some “hamiltonian-like” structure. One candidate of such structures is a
long cycle. From this point of view, a number of researches have been carried out
to give a lower bound on the circumference. When we extend The Chv´atal–Erd˝os
Theorem into this direction, the lower bounds are expected to be described in
terms of the order, the connectivity and the independence number.
Kouider’s Theorem in the previous section immediately gives one bound. By
taking a longest cycle in the cycle covering of Theorem 7, we have the following.
Corollary 1. Every 2-connected graph G of order n has a cycle of length at
least n/m, where m = ⌈α(G)/κ(G)⌉.
Fouquet and Jolivet [14] conjectured that a slightly better bound may hold.

κ has a cycle of length at least min


α

.
Though this conjecture has been solved for α = 2, 3, κ + 1 and κ + 2 (see [15],
[16] and [24]), it is still open for other values of α.
Both Corollary 1 and Conjecture 2 are sharp for general graphs. However,
if we restrict ourselves to triangle-free graphs, we obtain a much better bound.
The following bound was obtained by Enomoto et al. [11].
Theorem 8 ([11]). Let G be a 2-connected triangle-free graph of order n with
α(G) = α and κ(G) = κ. If α ≤2 κ −2, then G has a cycle of length at least
min{n, n −α + κ}.
In [11], they proved the sharpness of the bound min{n, n −α + κ}. On the other
hand, they fail to show the sharpness of the condition α ≤2 κ −2. However,
they constructed an example which shows that the conclusion no longer holds if
α > 5 κ −6.
5
Dominating Cycles
A set of vertices S in a graph G is said to be dominating if NG(x) ∩S ̸= ∅
for each x ∈V (G) −S, where NG(x) is the neighborhood of x in G. A cycle
in G is called a dominating cycle if its vertex set is a dominating set of G.
Trivially, a hamiltonian cycle is a dominating cycle. From this point of view,
several suﬃcient conditions for hamiltonicity have been extended to those which
guarantee the existence of a dominating cycle.
The notion of dominating set has also been extended in a number of ways.
One extension is a distance domination. The deﬁnition of a dominating set can
be paraphrased in terms of distance. For S ⊂V (G) and x ∈V (G), the distance
dG(x, S) between S and x is deﬁned by dG(x, S) = min{dG(x, s): s ∈S}, where
dG(u, v) denote the distance between two vertices u, v in a graph G. Then S is a
dominating set if and only if dG(x, S) ≤1 for every vertex x in G. Extending this
version of the deﬁnition, for a nonnegative integer m, we deﬁne an m-dominating
set S as a set of vertices S satisfying dG(x, S) ≤m for every vertex x in G. A
cycle is said to be an m-dominating cycle if V (C) is an m-dominating set in G.
By the deﬁnition, a hamiltonian cycle is a 0-dominating cycle.
Broersma [5] and Fraisse [18] independently gave a suﬃcient condition for a
graph to have an m-dominating cycle. A set of vertices S in a graph G is said
to be k-independent if dG(x, y) > k for every pair of distinct vertices x, y in S.
The order of a largest k-independent set is called a k-independence number, and
denoted by αk(G). By the deﬁnition, α1(G) = α(G).
Theorem 9 ([5], [18]). A 2-connected graph G with α2k+1(G) < κ(G) has a
k-dominating cycle.
The Chv´atal–Erd˝os Theorem corresponds to the case k = 0 of the above theorem.

Chv´atal–Erd˝os Theorem: Old Theorem with New Aspects

Theorem 9 was further generalized in [29]. Let f be an integer-valued function
deﬁned on V (G). Then a set of vertices S is called an f-dominating set if it
satisﬁes dG(x, S) ≤f(x) for every vertex x in G. An f-dominating cycle is a
cycle whose vertex set is an f-dominating set. If f is a constant function taking
value m, an f-dominating cycle coincides with an m-dominating cycle.
One advantage of an f-dominating cycle over an m-dominating cycle is that
it extends the notion of cyclability as well as hamiltonicity. For a given set of
vertices X in a graph G of order n, set f : V (G) →Z as
f(x) =

0
if x ∈X
n
if x ∈V (G) −X.
Then an f-dominating cycle coincides with a cycle containing X. Therefore, an
f-dominating cycle is a common generalization of a hamiltonian cycle and a
cycle through speciﬁed vertices.
For f : V (G) →Z, a set S ⊂V (G) is said to be an f-independent set if
dG(x, y) ≥f(x) + f(y) for each pair of distinct vertices x, y in S. The order of a
largest f-independent set is called the f-independence number, and is denoted
by αf(G). If f is a constant function taking value m, then an f-independent
set coincides with a (2m −1)-independent set, and αf(G) = α2m−1(G). The
following theorem was proved in [29]. For a function f : V (G) →Z and an
integer constant c, deﬁne a function f + c by (f + c)(x) = f(x) + c (x ∈V (G)).
Theorem 10 ([29]). Let G be a 2-connected graph and let f be an integer-valued
function deﬁned on V (G). If αf+1(G) ≤κ(G), then G has an f-dominating
cycle.

2-Factors
For a graph G and a positive integer k with k ≤α(G), we deﬁne σk(G) by
σk(G) = min

x∈S
degG x: S is an independent set of G of order k

.
If k > α(G), we deﬁne σk(G) = +∞. Using this parameter, we can paraphrase
Ore’s Theorem in the following way.
Theorem 11. A graph G of order n ≥3 with σ2(G) ≥n is hamiltonian.
Like hamiltonian cycles, factors in graphs are one of the main topics in graph
theory. When we look at a hamiltonian cycle from the theory of factors, we see
that a hamiltonian cycle is a connected 2-factor. Therefore, a suﬃcient condition
for hamiltonicity can be interpreted as a suﬃcient condition for a graph to
have a connected 2-factor, or a 2-factor with exactly one component. From this
observation, we naturally hope that suﬃcient conditions for hamiltonicity may
admit an extension to conditions for a graph to have a 2-factor with a speciﬁed
number of components. Actually, Brandt et al. [4] proved that Ore’s Theorem
admits such an extension.

Theorem 12 ([4]). Let k be a positive integer, and let G be a graph of order
n. If n ≥4k and σ2(G) ≥n, then G has a 2-factor with exactly k components.
Note that the balanced complete bipartite graph K2k−1,2k−1 satisﬁes the as-
sumption on σ2(G) and has order 4k −2, but does not have a 2-factor with k
components. Therefore, the bound 4k of the order in the assumption is almost
sharp. Later Enomoto [10] relaxed the assumption “n ≥4k” to “n ≥4k −1”
and ﬁlled the gap.
If we look at Theorem 12, we notice that the condition on σ2(G) is the same as
that in Ore’s Theorem. Actually, this condition is sharp for any positive integer
k. For example, Km,m+1 has no 2-factor. In other words, if a graph G of order
n satisﬁes σ2(G) ≥n, then the existence of a 2-factor with k components is
guaranteed for each integer k between 1 and 1
4(n + 1), while if σ2(G) = n −1,
we cannot even guarantee the mere existence of a 2-factor.
As we mentioned in Section 1, The Chv´atal–Erd˝os Theorem implies Ore’s The-
orem. And we have seen in this section that Ore’s Theorem admits an extension
to a suﬃcient condition for a graph to have a 2-factor with a speciﬁed number of
components. Therefore, we may expect that The Chv´atal–Erd˝os Theorem also
admits a similar extension.
Here we remark that when we consider this problem, we have to take the order
of a graph into account. Clearly, a graph having a 2-factor with k components
must have order at least 3k. This suggests that when we consider a suﬃcient
condition, we must always impose a condition on the order of a graph.
Chen et al. [7] posed the following conjecture.
Conjecture 3 ([7]). For each positive integer k, there exists a positive integer
f(k) such that every 2-connected graph G of order at least f(k) satisfying α(G) ≤
κ(G) has a 2-factor with exactly k components.
Kaneko and Yoshimoto [21] tackled the conjecture for k = 2, and claimed that
they solved it for 4-connected graphs.
Theorem 13 ([21]). Every 4-connected graph G of order at least six with α(G)
≤κ(G) has a 2-factor with two components.
Recently, Egawa [9] reported that the proof of Theorem 13 misses one case to be
considered, which leaves the correctness of the theorem in question at the time
when the author is writing this survey.
Like Theorem 6, if we allow the independence number to come into the bound
of the order, the conclusion of Conjecture 3 holds.
Theorem 14 ([7]). Let G be a positive integer, and let G be a 2-connected
graph of order n with α(G) = α and κ(G) = κ. Suppose α ≤κ. Then
(1) if n ≥k · r(α + 4, α + 1), then G has a 2-factor with exactly k components,
and
(2) if n ≥r(2α + 3, α + 1) + 3(k −1), then G has a 2-factor with exactly k
components, k −1 of which have order exactly three.
Note that the above theorem is not a complete solution of Conjecture 3 since the
bound of the order in the conjecture does not involve the independence number.

Spanning Trees
As an immediate corollary of The Chv´atal–Erd˝os Theorem, we have the following
suﬃcient condition for a graph to have a hamiltonian path.
Corollary 2. Every graph G with α(G) ≤κ(G) + 1 has a hamiltonian path.
Just as there are many ways to extend hamiltonian cycles, we can generalize the
notion of a hamiltonian path by looking at it from a diﬀerent point of view.
One may think that a path is a tree with at most two endvertices, where we
deﬁne an endvertex to be a vertex of degree at most one. This observation leads
us to investigate spanning trees with a bounded number of endvertices. For a
positive integer m, an m-ended tree is a tree with at most m endvertices. Thus,
a spanning 2-ended tree is a hamiltonian path.
Win [30] proved the following nice theorem, which naturally extends Corol-
lary 2.
Theorem 15 ([30]). Let m be a positive integer and let G be a 2-connected
graph. If α(G) ≤κ(G) + m −1, then G has a spanning m-ended tree.
Another extension of a hamiltonian path focuses on the maximum degree. We
say that a tree T is an m-tree if Δ(T ) ≤m, where Δ(G) is the maximum degree
of G. Then a hamiltonian path is a spanning 2-tree. Neumann-Lara and Rivera-
Campo [26] proved a Chv´atal–Erd˝os type theorem concerning the existence of a
spanning m-tree.
Theorem 16 ([26]). Let m be an integer with m ≥2, and let G be a graph. If
α(G) ≤1 + (m −1)κ(G), then G has a spanning m-tree.
Recently, Matsuda and Matsumura [25] gave a further generalization. They con-
sidered the existence of a spanning m-tree which contains speciﬁed vertices as
its endvertices.
Theorem 17 ([25]). Let m and s be positive integers with m ≥2, and let G be
a (s + 1)-connected graph. If α(G) ≤1 + (m −1)(κ(G) −s), then for every set
of s vertices S, there exists a spanning m-tree which contains all the vertices in
S as its endvertices.
By putting k = m = 2, we see that Theorem 17 not only extends Theorem 16, but
also extends the following variant of The Chv´atal–Erd˝os Theorem on hamiltonian
connectedness.
Theorem 18 ([8]). Every 3-connected graph G with α(G) ≤κ(G)−1 is hamil-
tonian-connected.
Recently, Enomoto and Ozeki [12] have considered a yet further generalization.
Let f be an integer-valued function deﬁned on the vertex set of a graph G. Then
a spanning tree T of G is said to be an f-tree if degT v ≤f(v) holds for every
vertex v in G. If f is a constant function taking value m, then an f-tree of G
is its spanning m-tree. Moreover, if we put f(v) = 1 for several vertices v in

G, an f-tree has those vertices as its endvertices. Therefore, an f-tree gives a
uniﬁed view to m-trees and those with speciﬁed endvertices. Note that a tree
of order n has n −1 edges and hence the sum of the degrees of its vertices
is 2n −2. Therefore, a graph G of order n has an f-tree, then it must satisfy

v∈V (G) f(v) ≥2n −2.
Enomoto and Ozeki made the following conjecture
Conjecture 4 ([12]). Let G be a k-connected graph of order n and let f be
an integer-valued function deﬁned on V (G), which satisﬁes f(v) ≥1 for each
v ∈V (G) and 
v∈V (G) f(v) ≥2(n −1). If
α(G) ≤min

v∈R
	
f(v) −1

: R ⊂V (G), |R| = k

+ 1,
then G has an f-tree.
They gave a partial answer to the conjecture.
Theorem 19 ([12]). Let G be a k-connected graph of order n and let f be
an integer-valued function deﬁned on V (G), which satisﬁes f(v) ≥1 for each
v ∈V (G) and 
v∈V (G) f(v) ≥2(n −1). Let Si(f) = {v ∈V (G): f(v) = i}. If
|S1(f)| + |S2(f)| ≤n −1 and
α(G) ≤min

v∈R
	
f(v) −1

: R ⊂V (G), |R| = k

then G has an f-tree.

Localization of Chv´atal–Erd˝os Theorem
In this section, we consider the localization of the Chv´atal–Erd˝os condition, and
pose a conjecture as a possible new direction of research.
A graph G is said to be claw-free if it does not contain K1,3 as an induced
subgraph. A number of suﬃcient conditions for hamiltonicity have been relaxed
in the class of 2-connected claw-free graphs. For example, while Ore’s Theorem
gives a sharp bound of σ2(G) which guarantee the existence of a hamiltonian
cycle for general graphs, Zhang [31] proved that 2-connected claw-free graphs
admit a better bound.
Theorem 20 ([31]). For an integer k ≥2, a k-connected claw-free graph of
order n with σk+1(G) ≤n −k is hamiltonian.
Oberly and Sumner [27] introduced the notion of locally connected graphs. A
vertex x in a graph G is said to be locally connected if NG(x) induces a connected
subgraph in G. And G is said to be locally connected if every vertex of x is locally
connected. Oberly and Sumner proved the following theorem.

Chv´atal–Erd˝os Theorem: Old Theorem with New Aspects
199
Theorem 21 ([27]). Every connected, locally connected claw-free graph of order
at least three is hamiltonian.
The closed neighborhood NG[x] of a vertex x in G is the union of x and its
neighborhood: NG[x] = NG(x)∪{x}. In other words, NG[x] is the set of vertices
which are distance at most one from x. Let Bx be the subgraph of G induced
by NG[x]. It is sometimes called the ball of radius one with center x.
A graph is claw-free if and only if α(Bx) ≤2 for each x ∈V (G), and x ∈V (G)
is locally connected if and only if κ(Bx) ≥2. Therefore, we can paraphrase
Theorem 21 in the following way.
Theorem 22. Let G be a connected graph. If α(Bx) ≤2 ≤κ(Bx) holds for each
x ∈V (G), then G is hamiltonian.
This theorem says that if Bx satisﬁes the Chv´atal–Erd˝os condition in a special
manner for each x ∈V (G), then G is hamiltonian. But we can naturally ask
whether the threshold of two between α(Bx) and κ(Bx) is necessary. Therefore,
at the end of this survey, we make the following conjecture.
Conjecture 5. Let G be a connected graph. If α(Bx) ≤κ(Bx) holds for each
x ∈V (G), then G is hamiltonian.

Computer-Aided Creation of Impossible Objects
and Impossible Motions

Abstract. There is a class of pictures called “pictures of impossible
objects”. These pictures generate optical illusion; when we see them, we
have impression of solid objects and at the same time we feel that such
solids cannot be realized. Although they are called “impossible”, they are
not necessarily impossible; some of them can be realized as real solids.
This is because a single picture does not convey enough information
about depth. Using the same trick, we can also design what may be
called “impossible motions”. That is, we can construct a shape of a solid
which looks like an ordinary solid but which admits physical motions that
look like impossible. A computer-aided method for creating impossible
objects and impossible motions is presented with examples.

Introduction
Optical illusion is one of the most interesting research topics in visual psychology,
and has been studied extensively [10,14]. However, there are a number of diﬀerent
types of optical illusion and uniﬁed study seems diﬃcult; each type of optical
illusion is studied individually. Among them, a class of pictures called “pictures
of impossible objects” forms a special type of illusion in that it is related to
three-dimensional structures while other optical illusions are primarily related
to two-dimensional structures.
The pictures of impossible objects are the pictures which, when we see them,
give us some ideas of three-dimensional object structures but at the same time
give us the impression that they cannot be realized in the three-dimensional
space. A typical old example of the impossible objects is the Penrose triangle
[13] found in 1958.
In addition to the area of visual psychology, the impossible objects have also
been studied from a mathematical point of view. One of the pioneers is Huﬀman,
who characterized impossible objects from a viewpoint of computer interpreta-
tion of line drawings [11]. Clowes [2] also proposed a similar idea in a diﬀerent
manner. Cowan [3,4] and T´erouanne [20] characterized a class of impossible ob-
jects that are topologically equivalent to a torus. Draper studied pictures of
impossible objects through the gradient space [6]. Sugihara classiﬁed pictures of
impossible objects according to his algorithm for interpretation of line drawings
[15,17].

Artists also use impossible objects as material for artistic work. One of the
most famous examples is the endless loop of stairs drawn by Dutch artist M. C.
Escher in his work titled “Klimmen en dalen (Ascending and descending)” [8].
Other examples include painting by Mitsumasa Anno [1] and drawings by Sandro
del Prete [7], to mention a few.
While those activities are stories about two-dimensional pictures, several tricks
have also been found for realization of impossible objects as actual three-dimen-
sional structures. The ﬁrst trick is to use curved surfaces for faces that look planar;
Mathieu Hamaekers generated the Penrose triangle by this trick [7]. The second
trick is to generate hidden gaps in depth; Shigeo Fukuda used this trick and gen-
erated a solid model of Escher’s “Waterfall” [7].
This paper shows that some “impossible” objects can be realized as three-
dimensional solids even if those tricks are not employed; in other words, “impos-
sible” objects can be realized under the conditions that faces are made by planar
(non-curved) polygons and that object parts are actually connected whenever
they look connected in the picture plane. For example, Figure 1(a) shows a line
drawing representing a V-shape solid with a horizontal bar. Exchanging the vis-
ible parts and hidden parts, we get the line drawing in (b), which belongs to the
class of pictures of impossible objects. However, this impossible object can be
realized as a solid in the three-dimensional space as shown in Figure 1(c).
Such solid models can generate visual illusions in the sense that although we
are looking at actual objects, we feel that those objects can not exist.
The same trick can also be used to generate a new class of visual illusion
called “impossible” physical motions. The basic idea is as follows. Instead of
pictures of impossible objects, we choose pictures of ordinary objects around
us, and reconstruct solid models whose shapes are diﬀerent from the original
objects. The resulting solid models are unusual in their shapes although they
look ordinary. Because of this gap between the perceived shape and the actual
shape, we can add actual physical motions that look like impossible.
The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we review the basic
method for judging the realizability of a solid from a given picture, and in Section
3, we review the robust method for reconstructing objects from pictures. In
Section 4, we study algorithmic aspect of our robust method. We show examples
of the three dimensional realization of impossible objects and impossible motions
in Section 5, and give conclusions in Section 6.

Ambiguity in Depths
In this section we brieﬂy review the algebraic structure of the freedom in the
choice of the polyhedron represented by a picture [17]. This gives the basic tool
with which we construct our algorithm for designing impossible motions.
As shown in Figure 2, suppose that an (x, y, z) Cartesian coordinate system is
ﬁxed in the three-dimensional space, and a given polyhedral object P is projected
by the central projection with respect to the center at the origin O = (0, 0, 0)
onto the picture plane z = 1. Let the resulting picture be denoted by D. If the

other hand, if the picture D is given, the associated polyhedron is not unique;
there is large freedom in the choice of the polyhedron whose projection coincides
with D. The algebraic structure of the degree of freedom can be formulated in
the following way.

For a given polyhedron P, let m be the number of vertices, V = {v1, v2, . . . , vm}
be the set of all the vertices of P, n be the number of faces, F = {f1, f2, . . . , fn}
be the set of all the faces of P, and R be the set of all pairs (vi, fj) of vertices
vi (∈V ) and faces fj (∈F) such that vi is on fj. We call the triple I = (V, F, R)
the incidence structure of P.
Let (xi, yi, zi) be the coordinates of the vertex vi (∈V ), and let
ajx + bjy + cjz + 1 = 0
(1)
be the equation of the plane containing the face fj (∈F). The central projection
v′
i = (x′
i, y′
i, z′
i) of the vertex vi onto the picture plane z = 1 is given by
x′
i = xi/zi,
y′
i = yi/zi,
z′
i = 1.
(2)
Suppose that we are given the picture D and the incidence structure I =
(V, F, R), but we do not know the exact shape of P. Then, the coordinates of
the projected vertices x′
i and y′
i are given constants, while zi (i = 1, 2, . . . , m)
and aj, bj, cj (j = 1, 2, . . . , n) are unknown variables. Let us deﬁne
ti = 1/zi,
(3)
and treat ti as unknown variable instead of zi. Then, we get from (2)
xi = x′
i/ti,
yi = y′
i/ti,
zi = 1/ti.
(4)
Assume that (vi, fj) ∈R. Then, the vertex vi is on the face fj, and hence
ajxi + bjyi + cjzi + 1 = 0
(5)
should be satisﬁed. Substituting (4), we get
x′
iaj + y′
ibj + cj + ti = 0,
(6)
which is linear in the unknowns aj, bj, cj and ti because x′
i and y′
i are known
constants.
Collecting the equations of the form (6) for all (vi, fj) ∈R, we get the system
of linear equations, which we denote by
Aw = 0,
(7)
where w = (t1, . . . , tm, a1, b1, c1, . . . , an, bn, cn) is the vector of unknown vari-
ables and A is a constant matrix.
The picture D also gives us information about the relative depth between a
vertex and a face. Suppose that a visible face fj hides a vertex vi. Then, fj is
nearer to the origin than vi, and hence we get
x′
iaj + y′
ibj + cj + ti < 0.
(8)
If the vector vi is nearer than the face fj, then we get
x′
iaj + y′
ibj + cj + ti > 0.

Collecting all of such inequalities, we get a system of linear inequalities, which
we denote by
Bw > 0,
(10)
where B is a constant matrix.
The linear constraints (7) and (10) specify the set of all possible polyhedron
represented by the given picture D. In other words, the set of all w’s that satisfy
the equations (7) and the inequalities (10) represents the set of all possible
polyhedrons represented by D. Actually the next property holds [17].
Property 1 (correctness of a picture).
Picture D represents a polyhedron
if and only if the system of linear equations (7) and inequalities (10) has a
solution.
Hence, to reconstruct a polyhedron from a given picture D is equivalent to choose
a vector w that satisﬁes (7) and (10). (Refer to [17] for the formal procedure
for collecting the equation (7) and the inequalities (10) and for the proof of this
property.)

Removal of Superstrictness
As seen in the last section, we can characterize the set of all polyhedrons rep-
resented by a given picture in terms of linear constraints. However, these con-
straints are too strict if we want to apply them to actual reconstruction proce-
dure. This can be understood by the next example.
Consider the picture shown in Figure 3(a). We, human beings, can easily
interpret this picture as a truncated pyramid seen from above. However, if we
search by a computer for the vectors w that satisfy the constraints (7) and (10),
the computer usually judges that the constraints (7) and (10) are not satisﬁable
and hence the picture in Figure 3(a) does not represent any polyhedron.
This judgment is mathematically correct because of the following reason.
Suppose that Figure 3(a) represents a truncated pyramid seen from above.
Then, the three side faces should have a common point of intersection when
they are extended. Since this point is also on the common edge of two side faces,
it should also be the common point of intersection of the three side edges of the
truncated pyramid. However, as shown by the broken lines in Figure 3(b), the
three edges are not concurrent. Therefore, this picture is not a projection of any
truncated pyramid. The object can be reconstructed only when we use curved
faces instead of planar faces.
By this example, we can understand that the satisﬁability of the constraints
(7) and (10) does not give a practical solution of the problem of recognizing the
reconstructability of polyhedra from a picture. Indeed, numerical errors cannot
be avoided when the pictures are represented in a computer, and hence the
picture of a truncated pyramid becomes almost always incorrect even if one
carefully draws it in such a way that the three edges meet at a common point.
This superstrictness of the constraints comes from redundancy of the equa-
tions. When the vertices of the truncated pyramid were placed at strictly correct

positions in the picture plane, the associated coeﬃcient matrix A is not of full
rank. When those vertices contain digitization errors, the rank of A increases
and consequently the set of constraints (7) and (10) becomes inconsistent.
To make a practical method for judging the reconstructability of polyhedra,
we should remove redundant equations from (10). For this purpose, the next
property is helpful. Assume that a picture with the incidence structure I =
(V, F, R) is given. For subset X ⊂F, let us deﬁne
V (X) ≡{v ∈V | ({v} × X) ∩R ̸= ∅},
(11)
R(X) ≡(V × X) ∩R,
(12)
that is, V (X) (⊂V ) denotes the set of vertices that are on at least one face in
X, and R(X) (⊂R) denotes the set of incidence pairs (v, f) such that f ∈X.
For any ﬁnite set X, let |X| denote the number of elements in X. Then the next
property holds [17].
Property 2 (nonredundancy of equations).
The set of equations (10) is
nonredundant if and only if
|V (X)| + 3|X| ≥|R(X)| + 4
(13)
for any subset X ⊂F such that |X| ≥2.
Refer to [Sugihara 1986] for the strict meaning of “nonredundant” and for the
proof.
Let us see how this property works by an example. The picture in Figure 3(a)
has 6 vertices and ﬁve faces (including the rear face) and hence |V | + 3|F| = 21.
On the other hand, this picture has 2 triangular faces and 3 quadrilateral faces,
and hence has |R| = 2 × 3 + 3 × 4 = 18 incidence pairs in total. Therefore, the
inequality (13) is not satisﬁed and consequently we can judge that the associated

Computer-Aided Creation of Impossible Objects and Impossible Motions
207
equations are redundant. Property 2 also tells us that if we remove any one
equation from (10), the resulting equation becomes nonredundant.
In this way, we can use this property to judge whether the given incidence
structure generates redundant equations, and also to remove redundancy if re-
dundant.
Using Properties 1 and 2, we can design a robust method for reconstructing
a polyhedron from a given picture in the following way.
Suppose that we are given a picture. We ﬁrst construct the equations (7)
and the inequalities (10). Next, using Property 2, we judge whether (7) is re-
dundant, and if redundant, we remove equations one by one until they become
nonredundant. Let the resulting equations be denoted by
A′w = 0,
(14)
where A′ is a submatrix of A obtained by removing the rows corresponding
to redundant equations. Finally, we judge whether the system of (10) and (14)
has solutions. If it has, we can reconstruct the solid model corresponding to an
arbitrary one of the solutions. If it does not, we judge that the picture does not
represent any polyhedron.
With the help of this procedure, Sugihara found that actual solid models can
be reconstructed from some of pictures of impossible objects [18,19].

Eﬃcient Recognition of Superstrictness
The next problem is how to check the condition in Property 2 eﬃciently. There
are O(2n) subsets of F, and hence if we check the inequality (13) for each subset
one by one, it would take an exponential time. We have to construct an eﬃcient
method in order to use the property for practical use. To this goal, we change the
inequality in the following way. Suppose that we are given an incidence structure
I = (V, F, R). For subset Y ⊂R, let us deﬁne
V (Y )={v ∈V | ({v} × F) ∩Y ̸= ∅},
(15)
F(Y )={f ∈F | (V × {f}) ∩Y ̸= ∅}.
(16)
That is, V (Y ) is the set of vertices included in at least one equation in Y , and
F(Y ) is the set of faces included in at least one equation in Y .
Then, the next property holds [17].
Property 3.
For an incidence structure I = (V, F, R), the following (i) and
(ii) are equivalent.
(i) the inequality (13) is satisﬁed for any X ⊂F such that |X| ≥2.
(ii) the inequality
|Y | + 4 ≤|V (Y )| + 3|F(Y )|
(17)
is satisﬁed for any Y ⊂R such that |F(Y )| ≥2.
Refer to Sugihara [17] for the proof of this property.

Let us consider intuitive meaning of the inequality (17). The ﬁrst term of the
left-hand side of (17) represents the number of equations in Y , and the second
term represents the minimum degree of freedom for us to reconstruct a solid
object from its projection. Recall that we have to give the z values of three
vertices to ﬁx the plane passing them, and have to give at least one more z value
of a vertex to specify the thickness of the solid.
On the other hand, the right-hand side of (17) represents the number of un-
knowns included in Y , because each vertex has one unknown and each face has
three unknowns.
Therefore, the inequality (17) says that for any subset Y of equations related
to two or more faces, Y should contain at least |Y | + 4 unknowns. This is a
general condition for a system of equations with nonzero degrees of freedom to
be structurally consistent.
Let G = (R, V ∪F, W) be the bipartite graph having the left node set R
and the right node set V ∪F and the arc set W ⊂R × (V ∪F) such that
(r, v), (r, f) ∈W if and only if the equation r ∈R represents that the vertex v
should be on the face f. From G we construct network N in the following way.
As shown in Figure 4, we add source node s and sink node t in such a way that
s is connected to all nodes in R by directed arcs with capacity 1, all nodes in
V are connected to t by directed arcs with capacity 1, and all nodes in F are
connected to t by directed arcs with capacity 3. Furthermore, we regard the arcs
of G as directed arcs from R to V ∪F with capacity ∞. We consider ﬂow from
s to t along arcs such that the amount of ﬂow coming in is equal to that going
out at every node in R ∪V ∪F and the amount of ﬂow along an edge does not
exceed the associated capacity.
Then, the next property in well known [9,12].
Property 4.
The maximum ﬂow from s to t in the network N coincides with
|R| if and only if
|X| ≤|V (X)| + 3|F(X)|
(18)
is satisﬁed for any X ⊂R.

Using maximum ﬂow algorithms, we can construct the maximum ﬂow of N
eﬃciently, and hence can check the inequality (18) for all X ⊂R eﬃciently.
Note that our inequality (17) is similar to (18); the only diﬀerence is the term
“4” in the left-hand side. In order to check the inequality (17), we modify the
network N by adding one left node q and arc (s, q) with capacity 4, as shown
in Figure 5. Next, we add two arcs from q, one to F and the other to V ∪F, as
shown by broken lines in Figure 5. For every possible connection we construct
the maximum ﬂow and see if its value is equal to |R| + 4, and thus check the
condition (ii) stated in Property 3 eﬃciently. Actually we can check it in O(n2)
time by some additional tricks. Refer to [16] for details.
Thus, we can check the superstrictness of the picture, and remove redundant
equations from (17) eﬃciently. Combining this with Property 1, we can check the
correctness of line drawings eﬃciently, and consequently can ﬁnd realizable impos-
sible objects.

Examples
The ﬁrst examples of the realization of the impossible object shown in Figure
1(c) was constructed in the following manner. First, we constructed the system of
equations (7) for the picture in Figure 1(b), then, removed redundant equations
using Theorem 2 and got a non-redundant system (14) of equations. Next, we got
a solution of eq. (14), which represents a speciﬁc shape of the three-dimensional
solid. Finally, we computed the ﬁgure of the unfolded surface of this solid, and
made a paper model by hands.
Figure 6 shows another view of this solid. As we can understand from this
ﬁgure, the faces are not rectangular.
Figure 7(a) shows another example of an impossible object constructed in
a similar manner. In this object, the near-far relations of the poles seem in-
consistent; the left pole is nearer than the other on the lower ﬂoor while it is
farther at the upper ﬂoor. This inconsistent structure is essentially similar to

that represented by Escher’s lithograph “Belv´ed`ere” in 1958. Figure 5(b) shows
the same solid seen from a diﬀerent direction.
Next, let us consider “impossible” physical motions. A typical example of im-
possible motions is represented in Escher’s lithograph “Waterval” in 1961,in which
water is running uphill through the water path and is falling down at the waterfall,
and is running uphill again. This motion is really impossible because otherwise an
eternal engine could be obtained but that contradicts the physical law.
However, this impossible motion is realizable partially in the sense that mate-
rial looks running uphill a slope. An example of this impossible motion is shown
in Figure 8. Figure 8(a) shows a solid consisting of two parallel slopes, both of
which go down from the right to the left. If we put a ball on the left edge of

the farther slope, as shown in Figure 8(a), the ball moves climbing up the slope
from the left to the right; thus the ball admits an impossible motion.
The actual shape of this solid can be understood if we see Figure 8(b), which
is the photograph of the same solid as in Figure 8(a) seen from another direction.
From this ﬁgure, we can see that actually the ball is just rolling down the slope
according to the natural properties of the ball and the slope.
Still another example is shown in Figure 9. In this ﬁgure, there are two walls
with windows, but a straight bar passes through them in an unusual way.

Concluding Remarks
We have presented a computer-aided method for creating “impossible” objects
and “impossible” motions. We formulated the design of a solid admitting impos-
sible objects and motions as a search for feasible solutions of a system of linear
equations and inequalities. The resulting method enables us to realize impossible
objects in the three-dimensional space.

The impossible objects and motions obtained by this method can oﬀer a new
type of optical illusion. When we see these objects and motions, we have a strange
impression; we feel they are impossible although we are looking at them. One
of our future work is to study this type of optical illusion from a view point of
visual psychology.
Other problems for future include (1) to collect other variations of impossible
objects and impossible motions, (2) to ﬁnd criteria for choosing the best shape
of an impossible solid among inﬁnitely many possible shapes, and (3) to apply
impossible objects to space art such as sculptures and buildings.

The Hamiltonian Number of Cubic Graphs

Abstract. A Hamiltonian walk in a connected graph G of order n is a
closed spanning walk of minimum length in G. The Hamiltonian number
h(G) of a connected graph G is the length of a Hamiltonian walk in G.
Thus h may be considered as a measure of how far a given graph is from
being Hamiltonian. We prove that if G runs over the set of connected
cubic graphs of order n and n ̸= 14 then the values h(G) completely
cover a line segment [a, b] of positive integers. For an even integer n ≥4,
let C(3n) be the set of all connected cubic graphs of order n. We deﬁne
min(h, 3n) = min{h(G) : G ∈C(3n)} and max(h, 3n) = max{h(G) : G ∈
C(3n)}. Thus for an even integer n ≥4, the two invariants min(h, 3n) and
max(h, 3n) naturally arise. Evidently, min(h, 3n) = n. The exact values
of max(h, 3n) are obtained in all situations.

Introduction
If G is a connected graph of size m, there is always a closed spanning walk of
length at most 2m. Goodman and Hedetniemi [6] introduced the concept of a
Hamiltonian walk in a connected graph G. It is deﬁned as a closed spanning
walk of minimum length in G. They denoted the length of a Hamiltonian walk
of G by h(G). Therefore, for a connected graph G of order n ≥3, it follows
that h(G) = n if and only if G is Hamiltonian. Thus h may be considered as a
measure of how far a given graph is from being Hamiltonian. Hamiltonian walks
were studied further by Asano, Nishizeki, and Watanabe [2,3], Bermond [4], and
Vacek [11]. Since every connected 2-regular graph is Hamiltonian, it is reasonable
to investigate the Hamiltonian number in the class of cubic graphs. In [10], it
was shown that all cubic graphs of order n for n = 4, 6, 8 are Hamiltonian. Let
P(k, m) be a generalized Petersen graph such that V (P(k, m)) = {ui, vi : i =
0, 1, . . ., k−1} and E(P(k, m)) = {uiui+1, vivi+m, uivi : i = 0, 1, . . ., k−1} where
addition is taken modulo k and m ≤k

of the parameters k, m for which P(k, m) is Hamiltonian. He proved that the

generalized Petersen graph P(k, m) is non-Hamiltonian if and only if m = 2 and
k ≡5(mod 6). We showed in [8] that h(P(5, 2)) = 11 and h(k, m) = 2k + 1 for
all integers k ≡5(mod 6) and m = 2.
The following result is known in [5] and will be applied throughout the paper.

Then h(G) = k

Graph Notations
For a graph G = (V, E) and X ⊆E, by G −X we denote the graph obtained
from G by removing all edges of X. If X = {e}, we write G −e for G −{e}. For
a graph G and X ⊆V , G −X is the graph obtained by removing all vertices of
X and all edges incident with these vertices from G. If X ⊆E(G), we denote
G + X the graph obtained from G by adding all edges from X. Similarly, if
X = {e}, we simply write G+e for G+{e}. Two graphs G and H are disjoint if
V (G) ∩V (H) = ∅. For any two disjoint graphs G and H, we deﬁne their union,
G ∪H, by V (G ∪H) = V (G) ∪V (H) and E(G ∪H) = E(G) ∪E(H). Since
the operation “∪” is associative, we can extend this deﬁnition to a ﬁnite union
of pairwise disjoint graphs. If G1 ∼= G2 ∼= . . . ∼= Gk ∼= G and G1, G2, . . . , Gk are
pairwise disjoint graphs, then we will use kG for G1 ∪G2 ∪. . . ∪Gk. A cubic
graph is a graph in which every vertex has degree 3. Let C(3n) be the set of
all connected cubic graphs of order n. It is well known that, for n ≥10, C(3n)
can be partitioned as C1(3n) ∪C2(3n) ∪C3(3n), where C1(3n) is the set of all
connected cubic graphs of order n containing a cut edge, C2(3n) is the set of
all 2-connected cubic graphs of order n containing a set of two cut edges, and
C3(3n) is the set of all 3-connected cubic graphs of order n. It is also well known
that the edge-connectivity and the vertex-connectivity of a given cubic graph
are equal.
The following graph constructions and notations will be used from now on.
1. Let G be a cubic graph and v ∈V (G). We denote G ∗v to be the graph
obtained from G by replacing v by a triangle, matching the vertices of the tri-
angle to the former neighbors of v. Thus G ∗v is also a cubic graph containing
a triangle.
2. Let G be a cubic graph. We denote G+ for a graph obtained from G by
subdivision an edge of G. Thus K+
4
is unique. When the subdivision vertex
is speciﬁed, say u, we use G(u) for a graph with V (G(u)) = V (G) ∪{u} and
E(G(u)) = (E(G) −xy) ∪{xu, uy}, where xy ∈E(G).
3. Let G and H be vertex disjoint cubic graphs. Let u, v be new vertices. We
denote ⟨G(u), H(v)⟩for a connected cubic graph of minimum order containing
G(u)∪H(v) as its induced subgraph. Note that the graphs G(u) and H(v) are not
unique but the graph ⟨G(u), H(v)⟩is uniquely determined by G(u) and H(v).
4. Let G, H and K be pairwise vertex disjoint cubic graphs. Let x, y, z be
new vertices. A connected cubic graph of minimum order containing G(x) ∪

The Hamiltonian Number of Cubic Graphs

H(y) ∪K(z) as its induced subgraph is denoted by ⟨G(x), H(y), K(z)⟩. Note
that the graph ⟨G(x), H(y), K(z)⟩is uniquely determined by G(x), H(y) and
K(z) and |⟨G(x), H(y), K(z)⟩| = |G(x)| + |H(y)| + |K(z)| + 1. More generally, if
G1, G2, . . . , Gk are pairwise disjoint graphs and for all i = 1, 2. . . ., k, vertices of
Gi are of degree 2 or 3 with at least one vertex of degree 2, then ⟨G1, G2, . . . , Gk⟩
denotes a connected cubic graph of minimum order containing G1, G2, . . . , Gk.
5. We use K−
4 for the graph obtained from K4 by removing an edge.

Cycles in 2-Connected Cubic Graphs
A factor of a graph G is a spanning subgraph of G. A k-factor is a spanning k-
regular subgraph. In particular, a 1-factor of a graph G is a 1-regular spanning
subgraph of G and a 2-factor is a 2-regular spanning subgraph of G. Let G
be a connected cubic graph containing a 1-factor F1 and F be a graph with
V (F) = V (G) and E(F) = E(G) −E(F1). Then F is a 2-factor of G.
By a well-known theorem of Petersen [7], every 2-connected cubic graph G
has a 2-factor. Thus if G is a 2-connected cubic graph, then the edge set of G
can be partitioned into a 1-factor and a 2-factor. The following theorem due to
Sch¨onberger [9] and it is considered as an extension of the Petersen theorem.
Theorem 2. Let G be a 2-connected cubic graph and e ∈E(G). Then G has a
1-factor containing e.
⊓⊔
As a consequence of Theorem 2, if G is a 2-connected cubic graph and e, f are
two incident edges of G, then G has a 2-factor containing both e and f.
In [10], it was shown that there are two 2-connected cubic graphs of order 6
and ﬁve 2-connected cubic graphs of order 8. All of those graphs are Hamiltonian.
For an integer m ≥3, let Cm denote an m-cycle, a cycle of order m.
Let G be a 2-connected cubic graph of order n ≥10 and F = k
i=1 Cpi be a
2-factor of G. If the girth of G is at least 5, then for each i = 1, 2, . . ., k, pi ≥5.
Let T = {x, y, z} be a triangle of a cubic graph G. Then T is called a pure
triangle if x, y, z have no other neighbor in common. If G contains a pure triangle
T = {x, y, z}, then we deﬁne G′ to be the graph obtained from G by identifying
the vertices x, y, z to a new vertex v, and joining v to the third neighbors of x, y
and z. Thus G′ is a 2-connected simple cubic graph of order n −2.
Theorem 3. Let G be a 2-connected graph of order n ≥6. Then G has a 2-
factor F = k
i=1 Cpi of G such that for all i = 1, 2, . . . , k, pi ≥4. Moreover, if
n = 4q, for some integer q, then k < n
4 .
Proof. Let G be a 2-connected graph of order n ≥6. The result of this theorem
holds if the girth of G is at least 5. Thus we can assume that the girth of G is
at most 4.
Suppose that G contains a pure triangle T = {x, y, z}. Let x′, y′, z′ be the third
neighbors of x, y, z, respectively. Then we deﬁne G′ to be the graph obtained
from G by identifying the vertices x, y, z to a new vertex v, matching v to the

neighbors of x, y, z not in V (T ). Thus G′ is 2-connected simple cubic graph of
order n −2. By induction, there is a 2-factor F ′ = m
i=1 Cqi of G′ such that
for all i = 1, 2, . . . , m, qi ≥4. Let C′ be the cycle in F ′ containing v and
suppose without loss of generality that C′ contains x′, v, z′ as its consecutive
vertices. By replacing v by x, y, z yields a cycle C of G. Thus we obtain a 2-
factor F = (F ′ −{C′}) ∪{C} of G satisfying the desired property.
Since K−
4 consists of two triangles with a common edge, any triangle of K−
4
can not belong to any 2-factor of G. Therefore, if G does not contain a pure
triangle, then any 2-factor of G is a union of cycles of length at least 4.
Suppose that n = 4q, for some integer q. Suppose further that G does not
contain a pure triangle and all 2-factors of G is a union of 4-cycles. Let F =

i=1 Cqi be a 2-factor of G such that q1 = q2 = . . . = qk = 4. Let C be a
4-cycle in F, V (C) = {x, y, z, w}, E(C) = {xy, yz, zw, wx} and x′, y′, z′, w′ are
the third neighbors of x, y, z, w, respectively. If xz ̸∈E(G) and yw ̸∈E(G), then
xx′, yy′, zz′, ww′ are independent and hence x′, y′, z′, w′ are pairwise distinct. By
Theorem 2, let F ′ be a 2-factor of G containing x′x, xy. Then, by assumption that
all cycles in F ′ are 4-cycles, either {x′, x, y, y′} or {x′, x, y, z} induces a 4-cycle
in G. Since x′ ̸= z′, it follows that {x′, x, y, y′} induces a 4-cycle in G. Similarly,
each of {z′, z, w, w′}, {x′, x, w, w′}, {y′, y, z, z′} also induces a 4-cycle in G. Thus
G is a Hamiltonian graph of order 8. Suppose that all 4-cycles in F induce K−
4
in G. Then G is Hamiltonian. Therefore, G has a 2-factor F = k
i=1 Cpi of G
with k < n
4 , as required.
⊓⊔
By using the result in Theorem 2, we obtain the following stronger result :
Theorem 4. Let G be a 2-connected graph of order n ≥6 and e ∈E(G). Then
G has a 2-factor F = k
i=1 Cpi such that for all i = 1, 2, . . ., k, pi ≥4 and
e ̸∈E(F). Moreover, if n = 4q, for some integer q, then k < n
4 .
Proof. By Theorems 2 and 3, the result of this theorem holds where G does not
contain a pure triangle as its subgraph. The result also holds if n = 6, 8. Suppose
that G contains a pure triangle T = {x, y, z}, n ≥10, and let G′ be the graph
as described earlier. Thus G′ is of order n −2. By induction, for every edge
e ∈G′, G′ has a 2-factor F ′ = m
i=1 Cqi such that for all i = 1, 2, . . . , m, qi ≥4
and e ̸∈E(F). Let C′ be the cycle in F ′ containing v. If e ̸∈{vx′, vy′, vz′},
then, without loss of generality, we may assume that y′, v, z′ are as consecutive
vertices in C′. Let C be a cycle obtained from C′ by replacing v by y, x, z. Thus
F = (F ′ −{C′}) ∪{C} is a 2-factor of G with the desired property. If e ∈
{vx′, vy′, vz′}, say e = vx′, then y′, v, z′ are as consecutive vertices on C′. Let C
be a cycle obtained from C′ by replacing v by y, x, z. Thus F = (F ′−{C′})∪{C}
is a 2-factor of G with the desired property. If e ∈{xy, yz, xz}, say e = yz, then
there exists a 2-factor F ′ = m
i=1 Cqi of G′ for all i = 1, 2, . . ., m, qi ≥4,
vx′ ̸∈E(F ′). Thus there exists a cycle C′ in F ′ such that C′ contains y′, v, z′ as
its consecutive vertices. Thus we can extend F ′ to a 2-factor F of G as described
above. Thus the proof is complete.

The Hamiltonian Number of Cubic Graphs

The Range of the Hamiltonian Numbers
For an even integer n ≥4, we have already denoted that h(3n) = {h(G) : G ∈
C(3n)}. We put min(h, 3n) = min{h(G) : G ∈C(3n)} and max(h, 3n) = max
{h(G) : G ∈C(3n)}. It is well-known that for any even integer n ≥4, there exists
a Hamiltonian cubic graph of order n. Thus min(h, 3n) = n. It is also well-known
that max(h, 3n) = min(h, 3n) = n if and only if n = 4, 6, 8. For n = 10, 12, we
have max(h, 3n) = n + 2. Observe that for n = 10, 12, a connected cubic graph G
having h(G) = max(h, 3n) is a graph with a cut edge. The problem of determining
max(h, 3n) is more challenging. The following facts are useful.
1. If a connected graph G contains an edge e such that G −e is connected, then
h(G) ≤h(G −e).
2. If G is a 2-connected cubic graph of order n and F = k
i=1 Cpi is a 2-factor
of G, then there exists a set X = {e1, e2, . . . , ek−1} ⊆E(G) −E(F) such that
F +X is connected. Thus h(G) ≤h(F +X) = n+2(k −1). In particular, if G is
a 2-connected cubic graph of order n, then, by Theorem 3, h(G) ≤n + 2(k −1),
where k ≤⌊n−2
4 ⌋.
3. For an integer n ≥10, let H = ⟨(q −2)K−
4 , 2K+
4 ⟩if n = 4q + 2 and H = ⟨(q −
2)K−
4 , K+
4 , K⟩if n = 4(q+1), where K is a graph obtained from a cubic graph of
order 6 and a subdivision of an edge. Then, by Theorem 1, h(H) = n + 2(q −1).
As a consequence of above observations, we obtain the following lemma.
Lemma 1. Let G be a 2-connected cubic graph of order n ≥10. Then there
exists a graph H ∈C1(3n) such that h(G) ≤h(H).
Proof. By using above observation and Theorem 3, we have k ≤q. Thus h(G) ≤
n + 2(k −1) ≤n + 2(q −1) = h(H). Note that H ∈C1(3n).
⊓⊔
By Lemma 1 and Theorem 4, we obtain the following result.
Corollary 1. Let G be a 2-connected cubic graph of order n ≥10 and e = xy ∈
E(G). Then there exist a closed spanning walk W of G such that x, y appear
as consecutive vertices on W exactly once and a graph H ∈C1(3n) such that
|W| ≤h(H).
⊓⊔
Thus in order to ﬁnd the value of max(h, 3n), by Lemma 1, it is enough to seek
for a connected cubic graph G ∈C1(3n) with h(G) = max(h, 3n). Let G ∈C1(3n)
with h(G) = max(h, 3n). Let B1, B2, . . . , Bk be the blocks of G with |Bi| ≥3,
for all i = 1, 2, . . . , k. Thus there are k −1 blocks of G of order 2. A block of G of
order 2 is called trivial, otherwise, it is called nontrivial. A nontrivial block B is
called a leaf block if B has exactly one vertex of degree 2. It is clear that G has
at least two leaf blocks. Thus by a nontrivial block B, we mean in this paper,
a 2-connected graph of order at least 3, 2 ≤d(x) ≤3, for all x ∈V (B), and B
contains at least one vertex of degree 2. Similarly, by a leaf block, we mean a
nontrivial block with exactly one vertex of degree 2.

Lemma 2. Let B be a leaf block of order b and 5 ≤b ≤9. Then B is Hamilto-
nian.
Proof. Since B is a leaf block of order b, b is odd and b ≥5. Let v be the vertex of
degree 2 of B. Then B can be pictured as in Figure 1. Let B1 = B′
1 +urvr. Then
B1 is a 2-connected cubic graph of order at most 8 and hence B1 Hamiltonian.
By Theorem 2, B1 has a Hamiltonian cycle C′ containing urvr. The cycle C′
can be extended to a Hamiltonian cycle C of B. Thus B is Hamiltonian.
⊓⊔
Let B be a nontrivial block. If W : x1, x2, . . . , xt+1 = x1 is a closed spanning
walk of B and e = xy ∈E(B), then we say that x, y appear as consecutive
vertices in W if there exists i, 1 ≤i ≤t, such that {x, y} = {xi, xi+1}. If x, y, x
appear in W as consecutive vertices, then we say that x, y appear twice in W.

Lemma 3. Let B be a leaf block of order b ≥11. Then there exist a closed
spanning walk W : x1, x2, . . . , xt+1 = x1 of B and a connected graph H with a
cut edge such that B and H are of the same degree sequence, and |W| ≤h(H).
Proof. Let B be a leaf block of G of order b ≥11. Thus B can be pictured as
shown in Figure 1. If B is Hamiltonian of order b ≥11, then we can choose
a Hamiltonian walk W of B and a graph H obtained from a connected cubic
graph of order b −1 with a cut edge e and a subdivision to the edge e. Thus
|W| ≤h(H) and H and B are of the same degree sequence. Suppose that B is
not Hamiltonian. Let B1 = B′
1 + urvr. Thus B1 is 2-connected cubic graph of
order b1 ≤b−1. If b1 ≤8, then B is Hamiltonian and the result follows. Suppose
that b1 ≥10. By Corollary 1, there exists a closed spanning walk W1 of B1 such
that ur, vr appear as consecutive vertices in W1 by exactly once and a graph
H1 ∈C1(3n) such that |W1| ≤h(H1), where B1 and H1 are of the same degree
sequence. Thus W1 and H1 can be easily extended to W and H with desired
result. Thus the proof is complete.
⊓⊔
For a 2-connected cubic graph G, we have constructed a closed spanning walk W
of G traveling along the cycles in a given 2-factor of G and k−1 edges connecting
between k cycles in the 2-factor. It turns out that for every edge on the k cycles
appears exactly once in W while every edge that connects to the cycles appears
exactly twice in W. Lemma 2 showed similar result for a leaf block.
Let B be a block of order b ≥3. If b = 3, 4, then B is Hamiltonian. If b = 5
and B is not Hamiltonian, then B ∼= K2,3 and h(B) = 6. Note that the graph
K2,3 has a property that for every edge e = xy, there is a Hamiltonian walk
containing x, y as its consecutive vertices exactly once.

The Hamiltonian Number of Cubic Graphs
219
If b ∈{6, 8}, B contains exactly two vertices of degree 2, and the two vertices
x, y are not adjacent, then the graph B′ = B+xy is a cubic graph of order b. Thus
B′ is Hamiltonian. By Theorem 4, B′ has a Hamiltonian cycle not containing
xy. Thus B is Hamiltonian. Suppose that the two vertices are adjacent. Let B′
be the graph obtained from B by removing the two vertices of degree 2. Thus
B′ ∼= K−
4 if b = 6, and B′ ∼= K if b = 8, where K is obtained from a cubic graph
of order 6 by removing one edge. Thus B′ is Hamiltonian and consequently B is
Hamiltonian.
If b ∈{7, 9} and B contains exactly three vertices of degree 2, then the three
vertices are not pairwise adjacent. Thus there are two vertices x, y of degree 2 in
B that are not adjacent and B′ = B + xy is a leaf block of order b. By Lemma
2, B′ is Hamiltonian.
Theorem 5. Let B be a nontrivial block of order b ≥6. Then B is Hamiltonian
or there exist a closed spanning walk W : x1, x2, . . . , xt+1 = x1 of B and a
connected graph H with a cut edge satisfying the following conditions.
1. For every edge xy of B, x, y appear as its consecutive vertices in W by at
most twice,
2. H and B are of the same degree sequence, and
3. t ≤h(H).
Proof. Let B be a nontrivial block of order b ≥6. Suppose that B is a non-
Hamiltonian graph. If b = 6, then B contains exactly four vertices of degree 2
and h(B) = 7. Let H be a graph of order 6 obtained from two disjoint triangles
and one edge connecting from one vertex of a triangle to one vertex of the other
triangle. Thus H contains a cut edge and h(H) = 8. Thus the result follows if
b = 6. Suppose b ≥7, B can be pictured as in Figure 1. Let B′ be the subgraph
of B induced by {v, u0, v0, u1, v1, . . . , ur−1, vr−1}. Thus V (B) = V (B′) ∪V (B′
1)
and E(B) = E(B′)∪E(B′
1)∪{ur−1ur, vr−1vr}. Let B1 = B′
1 +urvr. Then B1 is
a block of order at most b −1. If B1 is of order 5, then either B1 is Hamiltonian
or B1 ∼= K2,3. Since every block of order 5 has a property that every edge is
contained in its closed spanning walk of length 6, it follows that h(B) ≤b + 1.
It is easy to construct a graph H with the desired property. Suppose that B1
is of order at least 6. By induction, there exist a closed spanning walk W1 of
B1 in which for every edge xy of B1, x, y appear as its consecutive vertices at
most twice and a connected graph H1 with an edge cut such that |W1| ≤h(H1),
where B1 and H1 are of the same degree sequence. We now construct a closed
spanning walk W of B according to the following properties of W1.
1. If ur, vr appear exactly once as consecutive vertices on W1, then we obtain a
closed spanning walk W of B from W1 by replacing ur, vr by ur, ur−1, . . . , u0, v, v0,
v1, . . . , vr−1, vr. Thus |W| = |W1| −1 + 2r + 2 = |W1| + 2r + 1.
2. If ur, vr appear exactly twice as consecutive vertices on W1, then we obtain a
closed spanning walk W of B from W1 by replacing ur, vr by ur, ur−1, . . . , u0, v, v0,
www.ebook3000.com

S. Thaithae and N. Punnim
v1, . . . , vr−1, vr for the ﬁrst pair and replace ur, vr by ur, ur−1, vr−1, vr for the sec-
ond pair. Thus |W| = |W1| −1 + 2r + 2 −1 + 3 = |W1| + 2r + 3.
3. If ur, vr, ur appear as consecutive vertices on W1, then we obtain a closed span-
ning walk W of B from W1 by replacing ur, vr, ur by ur, ur−1, . . . , u0, v, v0, v1, . . . ,
vr−1, vr, vr−1, ur−1, ur. Thus |W| = |W1| −1 + 2r + 2 −1 + 3 = |W1| + 2r + 3.
4. If ur, vr do not appear as consecutive vertices on W1, then we obtain a closed
spanning walk W of B from W1 by replacing ur by ur, ur−1, . . . , u0, v, v0, v1, . . . ,
vr−1, ur−1, ur. Thus |W| = |W1| + 2r + 2 + 1 = |W1| + 2r + 3.
Thus W is a closed spanning walk of B and |W| ≤|W1| + 2r + 3 and for every
edge e = xy ∈E(B), x, y appear as consecutive vertices in W at most twice. On
the other hand, let B′ be a graph with V (B′) = V (B) −V (B1) and E(B′) =
E(B) −E(B1). Since H1 contains a cut edge e = pq, it follows that a graph H,
where V (H) = V (B′)∪V (H1) and E(H) = E(B′)∪E(H1 −e)∪{ur−1p, vr−1q},
contains a cut edge. Thus h(H) = h(B′) + h(H1) −2 + 4 = h(H1) + 2r + 1 + 2 =
h(H1) + 2r + 3 ≥|W|. Thus the proof is complete.
⊓⊔
Let G ∈C1(3n) such that n ≥14 and h(G) = max(h, 3n). Then, by Lemmas 2
and 3, there exists a leaf block of G that is isomorphic to K+
4 , and by Theorem
5, all nontrivial blocks of G are K2,3 or Hamiltonian. The following lemma is
easily obtained.
Lemma 4. max(h, 314) = 18, max(h, 316) = 21 and max(h, 318) = 24.
Proof. We now construct graphs G14, G16 and G18 with h(G14) = 18, h(G16) =
21 and h(G18) = 24. Let G ∈C1(314) such that h(G) = max(h, 314) and G
contains K+
4 as a leaf block. Thus G = ⟨K+
4 , G1⟩, where G1 is a connected
graph of order 9 containing 8 vertices of degree 3 and a vertex of degree 2. If G1
is 2-connected, then G1 is Hamiltonian and hence h(G) = 16 < 18 = h(G14).
Thus G1 contains a cut edge. Therefore G ∼= G14. Thus max(h, 314) = 18. Let
G ∈C1(316) and h(G) = max(h, 316). If G has only two trivial blocks, then
h(G) ≤16 + 4 = 20 < 21 = h(G16). Thus G must have at least three trivial
blocks. Since the order of G is 16 and G has at least two leaf block of order 5,
G ∼= G16. Let G ∈C1(3n) and h(G) = max(h, 3n). If G contains a nontrivial
block of order 3, then the block is a pure triangle. We can form a new graph
G′ of order n −2 by identifying the triangle to a new vertex, matching this
new vertex to the former neighbors of the triangle and h(G) = h(G′) + 3. Let
G ∈C1(318) and h(G) = max(h, 318). Thus if G has a block of order 3, then
G ∼= G18 and h(G) = 24. If G does not have a nontrivial block of order 3, then
G ∼= ⟨2K+
4 , 2K−
4 ⟩. Thus max(h, 318) = 24.
⊓⊔
Let G ∈C1(3n) and e = xy be a cut edge of G. A graph G(K4(v)) is a graph
obtained from G and K4(v) by deleting xy and adding edges xz, zy, zv, where
z is a new vertex. By Theorem 1, it follows that h(G(K4(v)) = h(G) + 9. Note
that the graph G(K4(v)) ∈C1(3n+6). Let G14 = ⟨2K+
4 , K−
4 ⟩, G16 = ⟨3K+
4 ⟩and
G18 = ⟨3K+
4 , K3⟩. Thus G14, G16 and G18 are connected cubic graphs of order

14, 16, and 18, respectively, and h(G14) = 18, h(G16) = 21 and h(G18) = 24.
Note that each of the graphs G14, G16 and G18 contains a cut edge. Thus for
an integer ni = 14 + 2i, i ≥3, a graph Gni = Gni−3(K4(v)) ∈C1(3ni) and
h(Gni) = 18 + 3i. Thus max(h, 314+2i) ≥18 + 3i, for all non-negative integer i.
We show in the next theorem that the graph Gni satisﬁes h(Gni) = max(h, 3ni).
Theorem 6. Let i be a non-negative integer and ni = 14 + 2i. Then
max(h, 314+2i) = 18 + 3i.
Proof. We have already mentioned that max(h, 314+2i) ≥18 + 3i, for all non-
negative integer i. We have also obtained max(h, 314+2i) = 18+3i, for i = 0, 1, 2.
Suppose i ≥3 and G ∈C1(314+2i) with h(G) = max(h, 314+2i). Let B be a
nontrivial block of G of order b which is not a leaf block and B is of minimum
order. The following ﬁve cases are considered.

Case 1. If b = 3, then B is a pure triangle. Let G′ be a graph obtained from G
by identifying B to a new vertex v, matching v to the former neighbors of B (see
Figure 2(a)). Clearly G′ ∈C1(314+2(i−1)) and by induction, h(G) = h(G′) + 3 ≤
18 + 3(i −1) + 3 = 18 + 3i.
Case 2. If b = 4 and the induced subgraph of B in G is a 4-cycle, then we can
replace B by a graph in Figure 2(b) and the result follows by Case 1.
Case 3. If b = 4 and the induced subgraph of B in G is a K−
4 , then let G′ be
a graph obtained from G by deleting the K−
4 and connecting the two neighbors

of K−
4 (see Figure 2(c)). Then G′ ∈C1(314+2(i−2)) and by induction, h(G) =
h(G′) + 6 ≤18 + 3(i −2) + 6 = 18 + 3i.
Case 4. If b = 5, then B is one of the graphs shown in Figure 2((d), (e), (f))
and the result follows by Case 1, Case 2 or Case 3.
Case 5. If b ≥6, then, by Theorem 5, B is Hamiltonian. By an arrangement of
blocks of G, we may assume that B is adjacent to a leaf block K+
4 . Let v be a
vertex of degree 2 of B such that v is adjacent to the vertex of degree 2 of K+
4 .
Since b ≥6, we may assume that the neighbors x, y of v in B are not adjacent.
Let G′ be the graph obtained from G by removing V (K+
4 ) ∪{v} and adding an
edge xy. Thus G′ ∈C1(314+2(i−3)). Since h(G) = h(G′) + 1 + 7 = h(G′) + 8, by
induction, h(G) = h(G′) + 8 ≤18 + 3(i −3) + 8 < 18 + 3i. Thus the proof is
complete.
⊓⊔
Recall that the range of the Hamiltonian numbers of connected cubic graphs of
order n is h(3n) = {h(G) : G ∈C(3n)}. It is easy to obtain h(3n) for small values
of n. In other words, h(3n) = {n} if and only if n = 4, 6, 8 and h(3n) = {n, n +
1, n+2} if and only if n = 10, 12. By using Theorems 1, 6 and Lemma 4, it is not
diﬃcult to show that h(314) = {14, 15, 16, 18}, h(316) = {16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21},
h(318) = {18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24} and h(320) = {20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27}.
Observe that for even integers n, 4 ≤n ≤20, h(3n) completely covers all integers
from min(h, 3n) to max(h, 3n), except n = 14.
Let j be a non-negative integer. A connected graph G of order n is called a j-
Hamiltonian graph if h(G) = n+j. Thus a 0-Hamiltonian graph is Hamiltonian.
A 1-Hamiltonian graph is called an almost Hamiltonian graph. We proved in [8]
that for an even integer n ≥10, there exists an almost Hamiltonian cubic graph
of order n. Furthermore, we proved that an almost Hamiltonian cubic graph is
2-connected. Thus for an even integer n ≥10, {n, n + 1} ⊆h(3n).
Let n be an even integer and n ≥10 and H be a Hamiltonian cubic graph of
order n −6. Then G = ⟨K4(u), H(v)⟩exists and h(G) = n + 2. Thus for an even
integer n ≥10, {n, n + 1, n + 2} ⊆h(3n).
Let n be an even integer where n ≥16. Consider the following elementary
facts.
1. The graph G = ⟨P(u), K(v)⟩satisﬁes h(G) = n + 3, where P is the Petersen
graph of order 10 and K(v) is a Hamiltonian graph of order n−11 obtained from
a Hamiltonian cubic graph K of order n−12. Thus {n, n+1, n+2, n+3} ⊆h(3n).
2. The graph G=⟨2K+
4 , K −e⟩satisﬁes h(G)=n + 4, where K is a Hamiltonian
cubic graph of order n−10 and e∈E(K). Thus {n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4}⊆h(3n).
3. The graph G = ⟨2K+
4 , K(v)⟩satisﬁes h(G) = n+5, where K(v) is a Hamilto-
nian graph of order n −11 obtained from a Hamiltonian cubic graph K of order
n −12. Thus {n, n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, n + 4, n + 5} ⊆h(3n).
4. Since max(h, 314+2i) = 18 + 3i, the maximum value of j of which there exists
a j-Hamiltonian graph in C(314+2i) is 4 + i.

5. If j = 4 + i, then there exists G ∈C1(314+2i) such that G is a j-Hamiltonian
graph in which all nontrivial blocks are Hamiltonian.
6. If 6 ≤j ≤4 + i and G ∈C1(314+2i) such that G is a j-Hamiltonian graph
containing a Hamiltonian leaf block B and v ∈V (B), then G∗v ∈C1(314+2(i+1))
and G ∗v is a j-Hamiltonian graph with a Hamiltonian leaf block.
We have the following lemma.
Lemma 5. If n ≥10 and C(3n) contains a j-Hamiltonian graph, then C(3n+2)
contains a j-Hamiltonian graph.
⊓⊔
By Lemma 5, if h(3n) + 2 = {h(G) + 2 : G ∈C(3n)}, then h(3n) + 2 ⊆h(3n+2).
Thus by Theorem 6, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 7. For an even integer n ≥4 and n ̸= 14. There exists an integer b
such that h(3n) = {k ∈ZZ : n ≤k ≤b}. Moreover, an explicit formula for the
integer b is given by the following.
1. b = n if and only if n = 4, 6, 8.
2. b = n + 2 if and only if n = 10, 12.
3. If n = 14 + 2i and i ≥1, then b = 18 + 3i.

Abstract. The hexagonal bipyramid fractal is a fractal in three dimen-
sional space, which has fractal dimension two and which has six square
projections. We consider its 2nd level approximation model, which is
composed of 81 hexagonal bipyramid pieces. When this object is looked
at from each of the 12 directions with square appearances, the pieces
form a 9 × 9 grid of squares which is just the grid of the SUDOKU puz-
zle. In this paper, we consider colorings of the 81 pieces with 9 colors so
that it has a SUDOKU solution pattern in each of the 12 appearances,
that is, each row, each column, and each of the nine 3×3 blocks contains
all the 9 colors in each of the 12 appearances. We show that there are 140
solutions modulo change of colors, and, if we identify isomorphic ones,
we have 30 solutions. We also show that SUDOKU coloring solutions
exist for every level 2n approximation models (n ≥1).

Introduction
The Sierpinski tetrahedron is a well-known fractal in three-dimensional space.
When A is a regular tetrahedron with the vertices c1, c2, c3, c4, it is deﬁned as
the ﬁxed point of the iteration function system (IFS) {f1, f2, f3, f4} with fi the
dilation with the ratio 1/2 and the center ci (i = 1, 2, 3, 4). It is self-similar in that
it is equal to the union of four half-sized copies of itself, and it is two dimensional
with respects to fractal dimensions like the similarity dimension and the Hausdorﬀ
dimension. We refer the reader to [3] and [4] for the theory of fractals.
Fig. 1 shows some computer graphics images of the Sierpinski tetrahedron.
As Fig. 1 (b) shows, it has a solid square image when projected from an edge,
and there are three orthogonal directions in which the projection images be-
come square. Here, we count opposite directions once. It is true both for the
mathematically-deﬁned pure Sierpinski tetrahedron and for its level n approxi-
mation model, which is obtained by applying the IFS n times starting with the
tetrahedron A, and composed of 4n regular tetrahedrons (n ≥0).
While studying about generalizations of the Sierpinski tetrahedron, the au-
thor found a fractal in three-dimensional space which has six square projections
[2]. This fractal and its ﬁnite approximation models are shown in Fig. 2. We
start with a hexagonal bipyramid Fig. 2 (A, B, C). This dodecahedron is the
intersection of a cube with its 60-degree rotation along a diagonal, and each of

Fig. 1. Three views of the Sierpinski tetrahedron ([2])
its face is an isosceles triangle whose height is 3/2 of the base. As (C) shows, it
has square projections in six directions and it has square appearances when it
is viewed from each of the 12 faces. We consider the IFS which is composed of
nine dilations with the ratio 1/3 and the centers the 8 vertices and the center
point of a hexagonal bipyramid. The pictures (D, E, F, G) and (H, I, J, K) are
the 1st and 2nd level approximation models, respectively, and (L, M, N, O) are
computer graphics of the hexagonal bipyramid fractal. As (G, K, O) shows, this
fractal and its ﬁnite approximation models have six square projections.
In this paper, we consider the 2nd level approximation model. It consists of
81 hexagonal bipyramid pieces and, as (K) shows, it has 12 square appearances
each of which is composed of 9 × 9 = 81 squares, which are divided into nine
3 × 3 blocks (P). This is nothing but the grid of the puzzle called SUDOKU or
Number Place. The objective of this puzzle is to assign digits from 1 to 9 to the
81 squares so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 block contains
all the nine digits. In SUDOKU puzzle, the digits do not have the meaning and
we can use, for example, nine colors instead.
The goal of this paper is to ﬁnd assignments of nine colors to the 81 pieces of
the 2nd level approximation model of the hexagonal bipyramid fractal so that it
has SUDOKU solution patterns in all the 12 square appearances. We also study
SUDOKU coloring problem of level 2n approximation models n ≥1.
Notation
When Δ is an alphabet and f is a function from Δ to Δ, we denote by
mapn(f) : Δn →Δn the component-wise application of f.
When p ∈Δn and q ∈Δm are sequences, we denote by p · q ∈Δn+m the
concatenation of p and q, and by q[i,j] the subsequence of q from index i to j.
We use two alphabets Σ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} and Γ = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i}.
Sequences of Σ are used for addresses, and sequences of Γ are used for colors.

Mathematical Formulation
We can deﬁne SUDOKU coloring not only on the level 2 object but also on level
2n objects (n ≥1). A level 2n object consists of 92n pieces and when it is viewed

from each of its face, we have a 9n ×9n grid of squares which consists of 3n ×3n-
blocks arranged in a 3n × 3n grid. Therefore, we have the coloring problem to
assign 9n colors so that each column, row, and 3n × 3n-block contain all the 9n
colors. We will ﬁrst formalize this SUDOKU coloring problem symbolically as a
problem of words.
We give addressing of the 1st level object with Σ as in Fig. 3 (A). We call the
pieces 0, 1, 2 the axis pieces and 3, 4,..., 8 the ring pieces. The address of the
level 2 object is given as pairs (a, b) for a, b ∈Σ, where a speciﬁes a block and
b speciﬁes a piece in the block. We call the blocks 0, 1, 2 the axis blocks and
3, 4,...,8 the ring blocks. Similarly, we give the addressing of the level 2n object
with a tuple in Σ2n. We sometimes ﬁx a viewpoint so that the nine pieces of
the 1st level object are arranged as Fig. 3 (B), and we specify a rotation of the
object with a permutation on Σ2n, instead of a changing of the viewpoint.
The symmetry group of a hexagonal bipyramid is the dihedral group D6 of
order 12. It is also true for its fractal and the ﬁnite approximation models. This
group is composed of a rotation σ of 60 degree around the axis between block 1
and 2 and a rotation τ of 180 degree around the axis between block 4 and 7.
When σ is applied to the 1st level object, the axis pieces are ﬁxed and the
ring pieces are shifted to the next position. Therefore, it causes the permutation
σ1 = (3 4 5 6 7 8) on Σ. A rotation on the 2nd level object is the combination
of a revolution around the axis blocks and rotation inside each block, as Fig. 4
shows. In general, σ causes on the n-th level object a component-wise application
of σ1, which is σn = mapn(σ1). We also consider the permutation corresponding
to τ, which is deﬁned for the 1st level object as τ1 = (1 2)(6 8)(3 5) and for the
level n object τn = mapn(τ1). Thus, the symmetry group of the level n object
is represented as ⟨σn, τn⟩. We also deﬁne reﬂection υ1 = (1 2) on the ﬁrst level
object and υn = mapn(υ1) on the level n object.
Deﬁnition 1. A coloring of the level 2n object is a function from Σ2n to Γ n.
We ﬁrst deﬁne a SUDOKU coloring of a 9n×9n-grid and then deﬁne a SUDOKU
coloring of the level 2n object.

Deﬁnition 2. A coloring γ : Σ2n →Γ n of the level 2n object is a one-face
SUDOKU coloring when
(1) The restriction of γ to a1a2 . . . anΣn is surjective for every a1a2 . . . an ∈Σn.
(2) For A1 = {1, 3, 4}, A2 = {8, 0, 5}, A3 = {7, 6, 2}, the restriction of γ to
Ad(1)Ad(2) . . . Ad(2n) is surjective for every function d : {1, . . ., 2n} →{1, 2, 3}.
(3) For B1 = {1, 8, 7}, B2 = {3, 0, 6}, B3 = {4, 5, 2}, the restriction of γ to
Bd(1)Bd(2) . . . Bd(2n) is surjective for every function d : {1, . . ., 2n} →{1, 2, 3}.
In condition (1), a1 . . . an speciﬁes a 3n × 3n-block and this condition says that
every 3n×3n-block contains all the 9n colors. In condition (2) and (3), a function
d : {1, . . ., 2n} →{1, 2, 3} speciﬁes a row or a column and these conditions say
that every row and every column contains all the 9n colors.
Deﬁnition 3. A coloring γ : Σ2n →Γ n is a SUDOKU coloring of the level 2n
object if γ ◦σnk is a one-face SUDOKU coloring for k = 0, 1, . . . , 5.
Note that γ ◦τn is always a one-face SUDOKU coloring when γ is, and we do
not need to consider it in this deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 4. (1) Two colorings δ and η are change of colors when δ = p ◦η
for a permutation p on Γ n.
(2) Two colorings δ and η are isomorphic when δ and η ◦r are change of
colors for r an element of the dihedral group D6 generated by ⟨σ2n, τ2n⟩.
(3) A coloring δ is a reﬂection of η when δ and η ◦r are change of colors for
r ∈⟨σ2n, τ2n, υ2n⟩.
We identify colorings obtained by change of colors, and in this deﬁnition, we
deﬁne isomorphism and reﬂection modulo change of colors.

SUDOKU Coloring of the 2nd Level Object
In this section, we determine all the SUDOKU colorings of the 2nd level object.
Consider the assignment of color ’a’ to the piece (1, 0) as in Fig. 5 (A). In ordinary
(A)
(B)
(C)
Fig. 5. Possible arrangement of one color ’a’

SUDOKU Colorings of the Hexagonal Bipyramid Fractal
229
SUDOKU, we cannot assign the same color ’a’ to pieces marked with ∗. In our
SUDOKU coloring, we cannot assign it to pieces with + either, because they
come to places with ∗by σk (k = 1, . . . , 5). Note that (1, 0) is on the axis of the
axis block and therefore ﬁxed by σ. As this example shows, the constraint we
need to consider is very tight. Fig. 5 (B) shows the places ’a’ can be assigned
after it is assigned to (1, 0) and (3, 3). This ﬁgure shows that there is only one
piece left in block 4 and 8, and when we have such an assignment, there is no
piece left on block 5 (Fig. 5 (C)). Thus, the assignment of ’a’ to (3, 3) will cause
a conﬂict. Similarly we cannot assign ’a’ to (3, 6). Therefore, (3, 1) and (3, 2) are
the only pieces to which we can assign ’a’, and they determine the left of the
assignments of ’a’ as in Fig. 6. Therefore, there are only two solutions for the
assignment of ’a’. It is also the case for the colors assigned to (0, 1) and (0, 2),
each of which has only two possible conﬁgurations, which are color ’b’ and color
’c’ in Fig. 6, respectively. As a consequence, we have only two colorings of the
axis pieces, given in Fig. 6. Note that they switch by the application of σ, and
also by the application of υ, modulus of change of colors.
It also shows that the SUDOKU coloring problem is the product of two inde-
pendent coloring problems, one is the coloring of the 27 axis pieces with three
colors ’a’, ’b’, and ’c’, and the other one is the coloring of the 54 ring pieces
with six colors ’d’, ’e’, ’f’, ’g’, ’h’, and ’i’. We have shown that there are two
isomorphic solutions to the former one.
Now, we study the coloring of the ring pieces. First, we study the two blocks
1 and 2. In Fig. 7, the four pieces marked with + (yellow) move to the places
with * (gray) by σ3, and pieces with the marks 3′ and 4′ move to 3 and 4 by σ3.
It means that the two colors assigned to 3′′ and 4′′ are diﬀerent from the four
colors assigned to the pieces marked with +, and thus equal to the two colors
assigned to 3 and 4 after the application of σ3, which are the colors of 3’ and
4’. The same consideration applies to every pair of adjacent pieces on the rings
of blocks 1 and 2, and therefore, we can conclude that the color arrangements
on the rings of these two blocks are the same. Since the coloring of the axis of
these blocks are also the same in both colorings of the axis pieces, block 1 and
2 have the same coloring.

Fig. 8. Coloring constraint of the ring pieces of block 0, 3–8
Next, we study the color arrangements of the ring pieces of the other seven
blocks. In the followings, we ﬁx the colors assigned to the pieces (1, 3), . . . (1, 8)
to be ’d’, . . . ’i’, respectively, as Fig. 8 (A) shows. In this ﬁgure, pieces 3, 4, 5, . . .
are located from the lower-right corner anticlockwise. Since block 1 and 2 have
the same coloring, the colors of the pieces (2, 3) to (2, 8) are also ’d’, to ’i’. Each
of the 18 lines of Fig. 8 (B) shows ring pieces which form the same row or column
from the viewpoint of Fig. 3 (B). Fig. 8 (C) shows the rows and the columns
of all the viewpoints in one ﬁgure, with the colorings of blocks 1 and 2 copied
around the other blocks. In this ﬁgure, there are 27 lines. This ﬁgure shows the
constraint we need to solve. That is, our goal is to assign 6 colors to the 42 pieces
so that each of the 7 blocks and each of the 27 lines contain all the 6 colors.
Before studying the general case, we consider the case the center block (block
0) also has the same color assignment as block 1 and 2. In this case, according to
the constraint, colors ’d’, ’f’, ’h’ can appear on the pieces 3, 5, 7, and ’e’, ’g’, ’i’
can appear on the pieces 4, 6, 8 of each block, respectively. Therefore, this color-
ing problem is the product of two coloring problems each of which is a coloring
of 18 pieces with 3 colors. One can easily check that there are two solutions to
each of them and we have 4 solutions as their composition. Since the two solu-
tions alter by the application of σ, we have two solutions modulus of isomorphism
(Fig. 9). Solution A has only one coloring pattern of a block, which is rotated by
120 degree to form three block patterns, which is assigned to blocks numbered
with (0, 1, 2), (3, 5, 7), and (4, 6, 8), respectively. Solution B has three block color-
ing patterns each of which is assigned to three blocks as Solution A.
When block 0 is allowed to have diﬀerent coloring from block 1 and 2, we have
more solutions. Solution A in Fig. 9 has hexagonally arranged six pieces with
two alternating colors which range over three blocks as Fig. 10 (A) shows. If we
switch the two colors on these six pieces, the result also satisfy the constraint

Fig. 10. Six pieces of Solution A, whose coloring can be switched
in Fig. 8 (C). There are three kinds of such hexagonal six pieces as Fig. 10 (A,
B, C) shows. In these three ﬁgures, the vertices of each hexagon have two colors
which can be switched. For each of these three, there are three places that the
same kind of switching may occur. Since there is no overlapping, two or three
switching may occur simultaneously as Fig. 10 (D, E) shows. Therefore, there
www.ebook3000.com

232
H. Tsuiki
are 3 × 3 non-isomorphic patterns of this kind. Patterns in Fig. 10 (A, B, C)
can occur simultaneously only when they have the same center as in Fig. 10 (F),
because there exist overlapping pieces for each of the other cases. Therefore, four
kinds of combinations: (A, B), (B, C), (A, C), and (A, B, C) exist. Therefore,
when we identify isomorphic colorings, we have 3 × 3 + 4 = 13 solutions except
for solutions A and B.
Next, we count colorings which are isomorphic to one of them. Three solutions
like (E) is mapped to itself by the application of σ2 and τ, and therefore there
are two non-isomorphic colorings, which switch by the application of σ. For the
other ten patterns, the application of σk (k = 0, 1.., 5) are all diﬀerent and τ will
map a coloring to one of them. Therefore, in all, there are 10 × 6 + 3 × 2 = 66
solutions if we do not identify isomorphic ones.
As the result, we have 13 + 2 = 15 solutions on the coloring of the rings
modulus of isomorphism, and 66 + 4 = 70 solutions if we do not identify isomor-
phic ones. Since there are two solutions on the coloring of the axis, we have 30
SUDOKU colorings of the level 2 model if we identify isomorphic ones, and 140
SUDOKU colorings if we do not identify isomorphic ones.
From the constraint of Fig. 8 (B), we can show that they are all the SUDOKU
colorings of the level 2 object. From Fig. 8 (B), each ring piece of a ring block
has three coloring possibilities as in Fig. 11. If we assume the color of (0, 3)
(red piece in Fig. 11) to be ’f’, then the possible colors of (3, 3) and (6, 3) are
both ’h’ and ’g’, and therefore, ’h’ is assigned to at least one of them. In the
same way, ’h’ must be assigned to one of (4, 3) and (7, 3), and one of (5, 3) and
(8, 3). Therefore, ’h’ is assigned to three pieces out of these six pieces, and one
can show through some calculation that it causes a conﬂict. Therefore, it is not
allowed to assign ’f’ to (0, 3). In the same way, we cannot assign ’h’ to (0, 3).
Therefore, only ’d’, ’e’, ’g’, ’i’ are allowed to (0, 3). Among them, ’d’ is the color
assigned in Solution A and B. When ’e’ is assigned to (0, 3), it is easily shown
Fig. 11. The other 13 solutions on the ring

SUDOKU Colorings of the Hexagonal Bipyramid Fractal
233
that the color of (0, 4) must be ’d’. Similarly, when ’g’ is assigned to (0, 3), the
color of (0, 6) must be ’d’, and when ’i’ is assigned to (0, 3), the color of (0, 8)
must be ’d’, In this way, we can show that the possible conﬁgurations of block 0
are only those obtained from that of Solution A through the switching listed in
Fig. 10. Then, for each of the color assignment of block 0 obtained in this way,
we can calculate one or two color assignments of the other pieces, which are all
among the solutions we have explained.
By the application of υ, the two axis colorings switch as we have noted, and
the ring coloring is ﬁxed because ring colorings on block 1 and 2 are the same.
Therefore, the switching of the two axis-colorings causes reﬂection of the coloring.
Theorem 5. The level 2 object has (1) 140 SUDOKU colorings if we identify
change of colors, (2) 30 SUDOKU colorings if we identify isomorphic ones, (3)
15 SUDOKU colorings if we identify reﬂections.

SUDOKU Coloring of the Level 2n Object
In this section, we show that SUDOKU colorings of the level 2n object exist for
every n ≥1.
Deﬁnition 6. Let γ : Σ2n →Γ n and δ : Σ2m →Γ m be colorings of the
level 2n and the level 2m object, respectively. We deﬁne a coloring comp(γ, δ) :
Σ2(n+m) →Γ n+m of the level 2(n + m) object as follows.
comp(γ, δ)(p) = γ(p[m+1,m+2n]) · δ(p[1,m] · p[m+2n+1,2m+2n]) .
Proposition 7. Suppose that γ and δ are SUDOKU colorings of the level 2n
and the level 2m object, respectively. Then, comp(γ, δ,) is a SUDOKU coloring
of the level 2(n + m) object.
Proof. We need to show that comp(γ, δ)◦σ2(n+m)k is a one-face SUDOKU color-
ing of level 2(n+m) for k = 0, 1, . . . , 5. However, since σ2(n+m) is the application
of σ1 to each component, we have σa+b(p · q) = σa(p) · σb(q) for p ∈Σa and
q ∈Σb. Therefore,
comp(γ, δ)(σ2(n+m)(p))
= comp(γ, δ)(σm(p[1,m]) · σ2n(p[m+1,m+2n]) · σm(p[m+2n+1,2m+2m]))
= γ(σ2n(p[m+1,m+2n])) · δ(σm(p[1,m]) · σm(p[m+2n+1,2m+2n]))
= γ(σ2n(p[m+1,m+2n])) · δ(σ2m(p[1,m] · p[m+2n+1,2m+2n]))
= comp(γ ◦σ2n, δ ◦σ2m)(p).
From our assumption, γ ◦σ2n and δ ◦σ2m are one-face SUDOKU colorings of
the level 2n and the level 2m object, respectively. Therefore, we only need to
show that when γ and δ are one-face SUDOKU colorings of the level 2n and
level 2m objects, respectively, then comp(γ, δ) is a one-face SUDOKU coloring
of the level 2(n + m) object.

Conditions (2) and (3) of Deﬁnition 2 hold because they are independent of
the permutation of the coordinates. We show that condition (1) holds. Suppose
that p1 ∈Σn, p2 ∈Σm, r1 ∈Γ n, and r2 ∈Γ m. We need to show that r1 · r2 =
comp(γ, δ)(p1 · p2 · q) for some q ∈Σn+m. Since γ and δ satisfy condition (1),
there exists q1 and q2 such that γ(p1 · q1) = r1 and γ(p2 · q2) = r2 hold. Then,
comp(γ, δ)(p2 · p1 · q1 · q2) = γ(p1 · p2) · δ(q1 · q2) = r1 · r2.
We proved in Section 3 that there are 30 SUDOKU colorings of level 2 object.
Therefore, by induction we have the following.
Theorem 8. There exist SUDOKU colorings of level 2n object for every n ≥1.
Usually, there are two ways of constructing level n + 1 approximation models of a
fractal from level n approximation models. One is to ﬁx the size of the fundamen-
tal piece and construct a larger model by combining copies of the level n models.
The other one is to ﬁx the total size and replace the fundamental pieces of a level
n model with level 1 approximation models. Correspondingly, there are two in-
duction schemes to prove properties of approximation models of a fractal. In our
proof of Proposition 7, we used both of them simultaneously. Let C0 be a hexag-
onal bipyramid we start with. We consider the following construction of the level
2n+2 approximation model Cn+1 from the level 2n approximation model Cn. We
replace each fundamental piece of Cn with a level 1 approximation model to form
a level 2n+1 approximation model Bn, then make 8 copies of Bn and locate them
on the vertices of Bn so that Bn becomes the block 0 of the level 2n + 2 object
Cn+1. Then, the size of the 3n × 3n-SUDOKU “blocks” of Cn is equal to the size
of C0 for every n. Our proof for the case m = 1 constructs the SUDOKU coloring
of Cn+1 from that of Cn and a SUDOKU coloring of the 1st level object.
Corresponding to this construction, it is more natural to shift the index of the
address space from [0, 2n] to [−n+1, n] = {−(n−1), −(n−2), . . ., 0, 1, 2, . . ., n}.
Then, the address grows in both directions when the level of the model increases,
and the 9n SUDOKU “blocks” are addressed with the index [−(n −1), 0] and
inside each block, each piece is addressed with the index [1, n].

SUDOKU Colorings of the Hexagonal Bipyramid Fractal

Conclusion
We showed that there are 140 SUDOKU colorings of the level 2 approximation
of the hexagonal bipyramid fractal if we identify change of colors, and 30 if we
identify isomorphic ones. This result is also veriﬁed by a computer program. Note
that the ordinary SUDOKU has 18, 383, 222, 420, 692, 992 solutions if we identify
change of colors [1]. Our SUDOKU problem has a strict constraint compared
with the ordinal SUDOKU and therefore it is natural that we do not have many
solutions. It is interesting to note that, as we have seen, all the solutions are
symmetric to some extent and are logically constructed. It is in contrast to the
lot of random-looking solutions of the ordinal SUDOKU.
Among the 30 SUDOKU coloring solutions, Solution A is most beautiful in
that the order of the colors of the rings of the nine blocks are the same. The
paper model in Figure 2 (H, I, J, K) has this coloring. This object is displayed at
the Kyoto University Museum, with an acrylic resin frame object with 12 square
colored faces. The 12 square faces are located so that this object looks square
with SUDOKU pattern when it is viewed through these faces.
