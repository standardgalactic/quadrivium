Preface
L. Shafai, University of Manitoba
Reflector antennas are extraordinary devices that combine high gain with geometrical 
simplicity and can operate in broad frequency bands. However, their performance 
depends on the electrical characteristics of the feed antennas that they operate with. 
The feed design is therefore the most important aspect of the reflector antenna design, 
and this volume is devoted to its theory, design, and analysis. From a practical point 
of view, the reflector feeds can be electrically small when used with single reflectors 
and large in dual reflectors. The mathematical approach and methodology for their 
design and analysis will also be different. In addition, the intended applications of 
reflector antennas will influence their characteristics and thus the feed properties 
and design.
To provide a comprehensive treatment of the topic, different chapters of this 
volume are devoted to different feed types, and experts in the area have authored 
each chapter. Following the introductory chapter, the mathematical techniques, in the 
form of efficient numerical methods for the feed design and analysis, are presented 
in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 addresses electrically small feeds, and both waveguide and 
printed planar types are discussed. Chapter 4 concentrates on the theory and design 
techniques for maximizing the feed efficiency, from the point of view of reflector 
antenna gain. Chapters 5 and 6 deal with the feed geometry and boundary conditions 
on its walls. Profiled geometries are considered to reduce the size and optimize the 
efficiency, while soft and hard boundary conditions are used to generalize the feed 
design and introduce metamaterials to improve the performance and physical char-
acteristics. Chapter 7 addresses the circularly polarized feeds, which are important in 
mobile and satellite communications. Chapter 8 presents a special class of multimode 
horns in the form of asymmetric feeds for polarization control and adaptive virtual 
arrays in parabolic reflector antennas. The mathematical treatment of the concept, 
along with practical equivalent hardware for both areas of interest, is discussed. The 
applications of the feed antennas are not limited to the reflector antennas. They are 
equally important in reflectarrays, lenses, and large direct radiating antenna arrays. 
They can be used in reflectarrays and lenses, as in reflector antennas, with similar 
performance and design criteria, as presented in these chapters. However, antenna 
arrays must take into account the array design rules and performance characteristics. 
For this reason, Chapter 9 is devoted to antenna arrays. It also covers the telemetry, 
tracking, and command antennas, which are important in satellite communications 
but not discussed adequately in open literature.
While the book is intended to address the fundamental aspects of the feed theory 
and design, ample examples are also provided to help with the practical aspects 
of the feed design. In most cases, the material in various chapters is based on the 

xii
Preface
published work of the authors. However, other pertinent works are also included to 
explain the underlying principles and to help with improving the practical designs. 
It is hoped that the materials in different chapters of the book will provide compre-
hensive insights into the critical aspects of reflector antenna feeds and impart useful 
design rules to readers.

ume, and I would like to extend my sincere appreciation for their interest, dedica-

Introduction
Reflector antennas have a variety of configurations that have been tailored for dif-
ferent applications. There are three main configurations that can be symmetric or 
offset. The symmetric geometries, shown in Figure 1.1, consist of a single reflector 
system, in Figure 1.1(a), normally known as the prime focus system; the Cassegrai-
nian dual reflector system, in Figure 1.1(b); and the Gregorian dual reflector system, 
in Figure 1.1(c). Most of these reflector antennas deal with communications and 
remote sensing applications that operate within the far field range and require high 
gains and narrow beamwidths. Important near field applications also exist. One 
such case is in antenna testing, where the spherical wave of the transmit antenna is 
converted to quasi-uniform field distribution in front of the reflector aperture, where 
the test antenna is located. The system, known as the compact range, eliminates the 
need for large outdoor test ranges for testing large antennas. Figures 1.2(a) and (b) 
show representative cases: symmetric and offset prime focus reflector systems being 
tested in a compact range. Figure 1.3 shows the compact range system, which is 
based on a large, serrated-edge offset reflector while being used for testing another 
smaller reflector antenna.
In nearly all reflector antenna applications, the reflector dimensions are large 
in terms of the wavelength. Their analysis can be simplified using asymptotic tech-
niques, such as the physical optics approximation or methods based on the diffrac-
tion theory. Analyses based on more exact numerical techniques, however, become 
time consuming. This is more important in dual reflector systems, especially the 
offset systems, where more than one reflection must be considered, and simplifica-
tions based on geometrical symmetry cannot be used. For this reason, equivalent 
parabolas are defined to convert a dual reflector system into a single one and are 
used to simplify the analysis [1]. This chapter deals with the feed systems only, and 
so the details of the reflector analysis techniques are omitted here for brevity. They 
are discussed in Volumes I and III of this series.

1.2	
The Feed System
In reflector antennas, the feed is the primary source of illumination and as such it 
influences the performance of the system. Its importance, however, is dependent on 
the reflector focusing system. In dual reflectors, the shaping of one or both reflector 
profiles can partly overcome the deficiency of the feed. However, in single prime 
focus reflectors, the feed controls the system performance. Thus, its design is the 
most critical challenge. Even in offset systems, where the reflector asymmetry causes 
undesired cross polarization, a proper feed design can significantly reduce the cross 
polarization of the reflected field.
The aperture size of the feed is strongly dependent on the reflector configuration 
as well as the directivity and sidelobe levels of the secondary reflector patterns. In 
dual reflector antennas, the subtended angle of the reflector, facing the feed, is small. 
Thus, the feed aperture size tends to be large to generate far field radiation patterns 
with narrow beamwidths. Although the large feed size complicates the fabrication, 
the narrow beamwidth simplifies the design rules for analytic solutions. Conse-
quently, accurate formulations are developed and used for excellent feed designs. 
In prime focus reflectors, the reflector-subtended angles are normally large, which 
require small feed aperture sizes. Thus, asymptotic or other approximations cannot 
be made for their accurate analysis. Efficient numerical techniques are required, or 
the use of experimental techniques, which were used in the early feed designs. Such 
experimental techniques are efficient for an experienced designer, but difficulties 
arise in the optimization stage. Additional help from the electromagnetic properties 
of the feeds and the secondary patterns of the reflector are needed to simplify the 
design. Fortunately, such information has been found through the radiation patterns 
and the cross polarization.

Introduction
In small feeds, the aperture field distribution can be approximated by electric 
and magnetic dipoles [2]. The equivalence principle can be used to compute the 
radiated field, which can be in terms of the aperture electric field, the aperture 
magnetic field, or both [3]. In the latter case, the dipole field equivalence is used 
to simplify the formulation and find the relationship between the electric and 
magnetic dipoles to minimize the cross polarization and control the radiation pat-
terns. For example, for an electric dipole, oriented along the x-axis, the radiated 
far field will be [1, 4]:

Thus, the resulting radiated field of the combined orthogonal electric and mag-
netic dipoles is a perfectly linearly polarized field, with zero cross polarization. This 
provides a simple rule for designing small feeds for symmetric prime focus reflec-
tors, which is equalizing the contribution of the electric and magnetic fields of the 
aperture to the far field radiations to provide zero cross polarization. For instance, 
in an open-ended waveguide the radiation is mostly due to the aperture field and 
the ring current on the waveguide end. Thus, by increasing the waveguide diameter, 
from its size at cut-off, the cross polarization of the radiated field decreases until it 
reaches a minimum before the excitation of the second mode. Similarly, in a circular 
microstrip antenna, the patch radiation is due to the electric dipole, and that of the 
substrate beyond the patch is due to both electric and magnetic fields. By increasing

Introduction
the ground plane diameter, from the patch size, the cross polarization decreases ini-
tially and reaches a minimum before starting to increase again. This property is used 
in Chapter 3 to design circular microstrip patch feeds with low cross polarization. 
Note that in the latter case, the cross polarization cannot be reduced significantly, 
unless the higher order modes of the patch can be cancelled by its feed or by other 
means. For other feed types, similar techniques can be developed to design feeds with 
low cross polarization, which are discussed in the upcoming chapters.
Aside from providing efficient reflector illumination for high gains, the reflector 
feed can also be used to perform other functions, such as the polarization control 
in dual-polarized reflectors, reduction of cross polarization in offset reflectors, and 
signal processing. To improve the feed performance in such cases, normally an array 
of feeds or feeds with multimode operation are used. Representative cases of such 
sophisticated feeds are shown in Figure 1.4. Two examples of adaptive dual-mode 
feeds are shown in Figure 1.4(a) and (b), which will be detailed in Chapter 8 of this 
volume for multiphase center virtual antenna applications. A simple dual-mode 
matched feed is depicted in Figure 1.4(c) for cross polarization reduction in offset 
reflectors, which will be fully explained in Chapter 3 of this volume. Finally, a four-
element array feed is shown in Figure 1.4(d) for monopulse tracking systems.
1.3	
Phase Center Determination
In the preceding dipole equivalence case, both electric and magnetic dipoles shared 
a common coordinate origin, that is, the feed had a unique phase center location. 
In practical feeds, on the other hand, this is no longer the case, and the phase center 
locations differ in the orthogonal planes. However, for low cross polarization they 
must be either coincident or very close to each other. In the design of the feeds for 
low cross polarization, the two phase centers must be as close to each other as pos-
sible. To accomplish this, the phase center location must be determined from the 
radiation patterns. For symmetric configurations the phase center is located on the 
axis of symmetry, which can be assumed to be along the z-axis. The feed radiation 
function can therefore be expressed as

where dc is the distance of the phase center from the coordinate origin. The steps 
for determining the distance dc (i.e., the location of the phase center) depend on the 
design requirements. In practice, the feed is required to illuminate the reflector over 
a certain angular range. However, within any angular range the E-plane and H-plane 
patterns (i.e., A(θ) and C(θ)) will not have the same behavior and the computed 
value of dc is θ dependent. For this reason, its value over a given angular range must 
be found as the most desirable value. That is, the phase center location over a given 
angular range must be determined by optimizing a certain required function, such 
as the least variation of the feed phase pattern over the reflector aperture or maxi-
mization of the reflector gain factor, and so on. In the former case, the phase of the 
feed radiation pattern is computed in principal planes and determines dc to minimize 
its variation. In general, dc will not be the same in both principal planes, and the 
average value may be selected. Alternatively, if the objective of the feed design is to 
maximize the reflector gain, one must determine dc to maximize the feed efficiency, 
defined in the next section, for the reflector.

Feed Efficiency
The feed efficiency ηf is the measure of its ability in illuminating the reflector to 
provide high gain. As such, it is defined as the ratio of the reflector gain over the 
gain of the uniformly illuminated aperture [6]. For a parabolic reflector having a 
subtended half-angle of ψ0 and excluding the aperture blockage, the feed efficiency 
using (1.11) through (1.14) becomes

Because the feed is not ideal, a number of factors contribute to its efficiency:
• The power lost beyond the reflector edge, which does not illuminate the reflec-
tor (i.e., the spillover efficiency ηsp);
• The cross polarization of the feed that channels the feed power to unwanted 
polarization (i.e., the polarization efficiency ηp);
• The nonuniformity of the aperture field illumination that contributes to the 
illumination efficiency ηI;
• The phase error of the aperture field that contributes to the phase efficiency ηϕ.

Introduction
The overall feed efficiency is the product of these four subefficiencies and can 
be written as
	
ηf = ηsp ηp ηI ηϕ 	
(1.16)
The expression for these subefficiencies can be written from their definitions, 
and in terms of the co- and cross-polarized components of the fourfold symmetric 
field, as provided in [8], which are listed below for convenience.

The preceding feed efficiencies are defined in the feed coordinate system and 
are valid with the assumption that the feed radiation patterns are symmetric. As 
such, they are valid for both symmetric and offset reflectors. However, all blockage 
effects are neglected.

Organization of the Book
This volume is organized into nine chapters:
Chapter 1: Introduction
Chapter 2: Computational EM Methods
Chapter 3: Electrically Small Feeds
Chapter 4: Smooth Wall Multimode Horns for High Aperture Efficiency—Theory, 
Design, and Applications
Chapter 5: Profiled Horns and Feeds
Chapter 6: Soft and Hard Horn Antennas
Chapter 7: Circularly Polarized Feed Antennas
Chapter 8: Generalized Asymmetric Reflector Antenna Feeds for Polarization 
Control and Adaptive Virtual Array Design
Chapter 9: Array Antennas and Low-Gain TT&C Antennas
Chapter 1 provides a general description of reflector antenna feeds and introduces 
their important electrical characteristics. The phase center concept is introduced 
and methods for its determination are provided. Feed efficiencies are also defined.
Chapter 2 deals with the mathematical techniques for feed design and analysis. 
Modern computational electromagnetics (CEM) methods have matured tremendously 
over the past decade, with several commercial software alternatives currently avail-
able (such as FEKO, HFSS, and so on). This chapter provides a brief summary of 
some of the most popular computer modeling techniques for the analysis and design 
of reflector antennas, their feeds, and other radiating structures in general. Starting 
from the first-principle of mathematical theory of electromagnetism, it introduces 
the method of moments (MoM) and the finite-element method (FEM) for the solu-
tion of integral and differential forms of Maxwell’s equations, respectively. Crucial 
implementation details of MoM and FEM are summarized, along with representative 
examples to illustrate these methods. Hybrid formulations of MoM and FEM are 
also introduced as a generalization for modeling fidelity and efficiency. The chapter 
concludes with fast methods and high-frequency approximations (physical optics 
and geometrical theory of diffraction) for solving electrically large problems. This 
introductory chapter with the most recent developments in the field of CEM is by 
no means complete. Key references are provided for the interested readers to guide 
them into the “enchanted” realm of CEM.
Chapter 3 deals with electrically small feeds, an important class of feeds used 
in prime focus reflectors for both symmetric and offset types. The design rules are 
presented first, and their applications are discussed. The feed types are divided into 
two main categories of waveguide type feeds and the planar microstrip type feeds. 
In the former case, the design procedures are followed stepwise, from simple open-
ended waveguides to more complex structures involving corrugated horns. For each 
case, the feed performance in efficiency, phase center, cross polarization, and back 
lobe levels is determined and discussed. The influence of different feed parameters is 
also studied and discussed. The advantages of coaxial waveguide feeds for dual-band

Introduction
applications are presented and used in practical feed designs. Beam shaping to tailor 
the feed radiation pattern to the available reflector is also studied and useful designs 
are provided. In the case of planar microstrip feeds, both microstrip patch and printed 
dipole feeds are considered and studied. The design rules are presented and practical 
designed feeds are provided. As a whole, the chapter provides comprehensive fami-
lies of useful and practical feeds and methods for their designs and improvements.
Chapter 4 presents the design and analysis of high-efficiency, smooth wall horn 
structures. It begins with a discussion on the general principle of high aperture 
efficiency radiation. It is shown analytically that for achieving high aperture effi-
ciency from a horn radiator, only the transverse electric (TE) types of waveguide 
modes should be excited. Also, for a given aperture shape, the relative amplitude 
and phase distributions of the modes are independent of the aperture size. It is then 
demonstrated that the required amplitude and phase distributions of the desired 
modes can be realized by using multiple steps and flared sections. It then presents 
the characteristics of circular and square high efficiency horn structures followed 
by their design procedures. The multiflared high-efficiency horns without steps are 
also considered, and their performances are compared with that of “step-and-flared” 
horns. Characteristic features of other types of high-efficiency horn structures are 
also discussed. Potential applications of high-efficiency horns in arrays and multi-
beam reflectors are shown and the advantages are discussed.
Chapter 5 outlines the historical development of employing the horn profile in 
designs to achieve a suitable radiation performance of an antenna feed for a reflector 
or lens. In particular, we show that by the use of modern computational methods 
for both representing the horn structure and automatic design through optimiza-
tion, nonintuitive horn structures can be created that meet specified performance 
specifications. Representative examples are given that demonstrate the power of 
this design approach for general horn types that are metallic, smooth-walled or cor-
rugated or for open structures such as dielectric rods, as well as for arrays of these 
horns. It is anticipated that profiled horns will be employed more frequently in the 
future to develop designs that are fit to meet ever-demanding requirements, whether 
for communications, radar, or security.
Chapter 6 deals with soft and hard horns and their implementation using meta-
materials. Soft and hard horn antennas belong to a class of antennas called hybrid 
mode horns. These horns produce low cross polarization over a wide bandwidth, 
which makes them ideal for satellite communications, where frequency reuse is a 
requirement. Soft horns produce low sidelobes, making them ideal as feeds for reflec-
tor antennas. Hard horns can be used in array antennas to generate high aperture 
efficiency. Various soft and hard horns are introduced and compared, including 
metamaterial-based horn antennas.
In communication systems that use circularly polarized (CP) transmitting and 
receiving reflector antennas, there is no need to adjust the orientation of the antenna 
polarization. Chapter 7 presents feed antennas for CP reflector antennas and discusses 
their characteristics, including the radiation pattern, beamwidth, axial ratio, gain, and 
input performance. Ten sections constitute this chapter. Section 7.2 briefly describes 
two analysis methods for CP feed antenna design: the method of moments (MoM), 
and finite-difference time-domain method (FDTDM). Sections 7.3 and 7.4 discuss

generation of CP radiation, referring to a parallel plate polarizer, a conducting fin 
in a circular waveguide, and the two-point excitation of a patch. The technique in 
these two sections is called the synthesized CP radiation technique. The remaining 
sections, Sections 7.5 to 7.10, are devoted to presentation and discussion for CP feed 
antennas based on a traveling wave current distribution. These CP feed antennas are 
end-fire helical, end-fire helical array, back-fire helical, conical-helical, spiral, and 
curl feed antennas. The CP waves from these antennas are designed by the loop-
based circularly-polarized radiation technique and have wideband characteristics.
Chapter 8 is devoted to asymmetric multimode horns for polarization control 
and a new class of multimode horns for adaptive reflector aperture distributions. 
The principle of multimode horn excitation is introduced mathematically, and the 
equivalent hardware using multimode antennas (such as waveguides, horns, and 
microstrip patches) is identified, which formalizes the design process. Two separate 
application areas are also discussed. In one, the asymmetric feeds for polarization 
control in offset reflector are introduced, and sample designs with excellent termi-
nal isolation are presented and studied. In the second class of the feeds, adaptive 
multimode feeds are introduced and shown how they can be used with reflector 
antennas to design and implement adaptive virtual arrays with adaptive electrical 
characteristics.
Finally, Chapter 9 covers array antennas and TT&C (telemetry, tracking, and 
command) antennas that are widely used in satellite communications. Although the 
array antennas are used by themselves or as feed arrays for reflector antennas, the 
low-gain TT&C antennas are critical components of the antenna payloads and are 
part of any communication satellite, together with reflector antennas. Practical design 
aspects of array antennas and design equations are presented. TT&C antennas are 
not covered in detail in textbooks and are included in this volume for the first time. 
Design, radio frequency (RF) performance, and hardware pictures are provided for 
these low-gain antennas.
The feed antennas presented and discussed in the volume have been identified 
with conventional reflector antennas. However, lens and reflectarrays share similar 
optical principles with the reflectors. Thus, the feeds presented in this volume are 
equally useful for lens and reflectarray antennas. Modifying their design parameters 
meets the needs of the latter two antennas.

Introduction
Modern computers make it possible to analyze and design reflector antennas and 
arrays using first principle mathematical theory of electromagnetic fields. This chapter 
is intended to introduce the reader to some of the most popular numerical methods 
that are in use today. With increasing computer speeds and the introduction of mul-
ticore parallel computing, the past decade has witnessed an unprecedented prolifera-
tion of commercial simulation packages as the main tool in analyzing and designing 
antennas, RF components, and integrated systems. However, one should not overlook 
the fact that the popularity of these numerical algorithms is primarily due to theoreti-
cal breakthroughs that ensure solution accuracy as well as reliability and efficiency.
In this chapter, we first summarize two of the most popular numerical analysis 
methods, the moment of method (MoM) and the finite-element method (FEM). We 
start from the basic principles described by Maxwell’s equations given in Section 2.2 
and develop integral representations suitable for MoM implementation in Section 
2.3. Perhaps the most profound leap that introduces discrete representations, and 
thus the use of computers for solving arbitrary real-life problems, is the mathemati-
cal foundations of finite elements. We introduce finite elements first in the context 
of MoM discretizations as surface triangulations, and subsequently more generally 
in the context of the FEM in Section 2.4.
Hybrid algorithms combining MoM for the exact truncation of the FEM domain 
are discussed  in Section 2.5. Another efficient method to reduce the computational 
cost of MoM is the fast multipole method (FMM) and its multilevel implementa-
tions (MLFMM). We provide the essential theory that allows for compression of the 
MoM matrix and the main equations behind FMM in Section 2.6. We also touch 
upon the fast frequency sweep algorithms utilizing Pade expansions in this section.
The MoM and the FEM are so-called full-wave methods that model the exact 
electromagnetic behavior of the problem. As such, the size of the discrete problem 
generated by either method is proportional to the wavelength (in linear dimension), 
generating larger size matrix equations as the frequency of interest increases. This 
frequency scaling often limits the applicability of full-wave methods to problems 
of several hundred wavelengths in size. For even larger geometries, high-frequency

approximations are employed. Approximations based on physical optics and ray-
tracing are among the most popular and are discussed in Section 2.7.
These numerical solution methodologies are illustrated with suitable examples 
that can be utilized in reflector feed antennas as well as reflector antenna analysis.

Maxwell’s Equations: Foundations of  
Electromagnetic Analysis
All computational electromagnetics (CEM) methods are formulated to solve Max-
well’s equations in one fashion or the other to obtain electric and magnetic fields 
or electric and magnetic currents. Electromagnetic properties of antennas such as 
return loss, radiation patterns, and so on can be obtained using these quantities.
We shall start by introducing Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetic fields, neatly 
summarized in the following four equations that relate various source, field, and 
flux quantities.

CEM is the branch of science that deals with the approximate numerical solu-

of linearity of Maxwell’s equations and formulate closed-form solutions of elemental 
delta function sources, as introduced next.

The integral representations of the field radiated by sources M and J in (2.19) 
and (2.22) will be used below to construct integral equations for a given problem 
geometry. In the resulting integral equation, the known field quantities are given in 
terms of incident fields and/or port voltages/currents. As such, the quantity of inter-
est is the induced electric and/or magnetic current densities in the solution domain. 
These quantities appear under the integral operator in (2.19) and (2.22) and the 
properties of the Green’s function (2.23) as well as the continuity conditions must be 
respected in the solution of such integral equations. In the next section, we introduce 
the MoM procedure using a simple electric field integral equation for a scattering 
target made of perfectly conducting surface(s).
2.3	
Method of Moments (MoM)
The MoM is the workhorse method for solving scattering and radiation problems. 
The procedure starts with an integral equation that describes the problem in terms 
of known incident field and unknown induced current quantities. The boundary 
conditions are determined by the specific geometry as well as the material distribu-
tion in the solution domain [1]. A typical problem setup is shown in Figure 2.2, 
where an incident field is impinging upon a conducting antenna with open-circuited 
terminals. Here, the antenna is a simple bow-tie dipole and its open circuited port 
is simply represented by a gap in the two dipole arms.

Numerical Methods
Once the suitable integral equation is constructed, it is discretized to convert the 
continuous problem into a discrete one that can be solved using a digital computer. 
This is accomplished using a discrete approximation of the unknown quantity (such 
as current density) using a set of known basis functions with unknown coefficients. 
To represent the unknown currents in discrete form, first the geometry of the problem 
is approximated using simple element shapes, such as triangular elements. This step 
is called the mesh generation, or simply meshing. Next, basis functions are defined 
on these simple elements and the mesh connectivity and continuity conditions are 
enforced. Through a relatively straightforward enforcement of the approximated 
integral equation via the testing process, the point-wise continuous integral equation 
is transformed into a system of linear equations of dimension N proportional to the 
number of finite elements used in the discretization. These steps are illustrated below 
using an antenna scattering problem, as depicted in Figure 2.2.
2.3.1	
Integral Equation Formulation
The natural boundary condition for the total tangential electric field over a perfectly 
electrically conducting (PEC) surface can be used to formulate an integral equation 
for most scattering and radiation problems that do not involve any materials. It is 
known that an incident field induces surface currents on the antenna (or the scat-
terer) surface that give rise to scattered fields formulated as:

where s is the PEC surface of the antenna and Js(r) is the induced currents on the 
surface. We note that we used (2.19) and reduced the integration domain to the 
antenna surface in (2.25).
The total tangential electric field on the PEC parts of the antenna must be equal

where bn(r) are the known basis functions.
In order to mathematically represent these basis functions as surface vector fields 
flowing conformally on the antenna geometry, a mathematical representation of 
the antenna surfaces themselves is needed. For arbitrary geometries encountered in 
real-life situations, a closed form representation of the problem geometry is almost 
never available. As such, the geometry is approximately represented in terms of a 
connected mesh of simplex shapes, called finite elements or mesh elements. Although 
general multilateral and curvilinear element representations have been developed, 
simple flat triangulations are among the most widely used meshing methods.
2.3.2	
Geometry Representations and Meshing
Mathematical representation of the problem geometry is a first step in the MoM 
solution of scattering and radiation problems. As mentioned previously, it is necessary 
in order to define the basis functions used in the expansion (2.28) for discretizing 

20

the unknown currents. Perhaps the simplest way of describing an arbitrarily shaped 
3-D surface of a typical antenna is to use flat triangular elements, as shown in Fig-
ure 2.3. Here, the surface of the bowtie dipole is meshed uniformly using the com-
mercial software FEKO (http://www.feko.info/). Since this particular antenna does 
not involve any curved surfaces and/or edges, the geometry representation using flat 
triangular mesh is excellent. For geometries with curved boundaries and/or surfaces, 
curvilinear elements may be employed for better fidelity. However, a dense flat trian-
gulation can resolve and represent curved surfaces quite effectively as well. As such, 
the simplicity of flat triangulations is often advantageous in the implementation of 
the MoM procedure for general shapes.
A flat triangular element is uniquely represented by the three ordered vertices 
in space (r1,r2,r3), as shown in Figure 2.4. Any point r within the triangle is given by 
its barycentric (area) coordinates (ξ1,ξ2,ξ3),

The order of the list of corner nodes (r1,r2,r3) also determines a unique surface 
normal, which must be respected throughout the complete geometry mesh. This is

particularly important for the accurate implementation of integral equation formu-
lations that involve surface normals, such as the magnetic field integral equation 
(MFIE).
The simplex triangular mesh can be easily represented on the computer using 
two lists. The first list has the coordinates of all nodes in the mesh and the second 
list defines each triangular element in terms of the three node numbers, as illustrated 
in Table 2.1.
The connectivity information can be deduced from these lists by searching the 
nodes that are shared between multiple triangles. For example, in the list in Table 
2.1, Element 1 and Element 2 share the Nodes 2 and 3 and are thus connected, 
sharing an edge. Mesh connectivity is necessary for enforcing continuity conditions 
on the basis functions representing current densities. Such continuity conditions are 
essential in the physical world and must also be respected when defining the basis 
functions used in the MoM procedure properly.
Other multilateral mesh elements are also common in MoM implementations. 
In addition to flat triangulations, bi-linear quadrilateral elements, curvilinear tri-
angular, and quadrilateral elements are also used in Figure 2.5. In particular, for 
problem geometries involving curved surfaces, curvilinear meshes can provide much 
improved accuracy by minimizing the geometry modeling error introduced in the 
MoM discretization [2]. However, it must be noted that the MoM implementation, 
including the conformal basis functions, the evaluation of the derivatives and the 
singular integrals in the self terms (m = n) of (2.34) become considerably involved 
and care must be exercised in the implementation.

Basis Functions
It is relatively straightforward to formulate tangential vector fields representing the 
surface current basis functions on the triangular elements described. However, care 
must be taken to enforce the continuity of the normal current component across the 
neighboring triangular elements. The simplest basis function that respects normal 
current continuity is the well-known Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis function [3] 
defined over two neighboring elements (see Figure 2.6). The basis function flowing 
from triangle s+ to triangle s− is defined as

Here, lc is the length of the common edge between the two triangles, A+ and A− are

It can be shown that with the definition in (2.31), the normal component of 
the two vector field defined over s+ and s− are continuous across the common edge, 
which is a physical necessity for the surface currents.
Several other element types and basis functions can be found in the literature. 
See Volakis and Sertel [4] for an in-depth discussion on the subject.
2.3.4	
Construction of the Impedance Matrix Equation
To arrive at the solution of (2.27), we are looking for the unknown coefficients 
in the basis function expansion (2.28) that best satisfies (2.29). By describing the 
problem geometry with discrete elements and the unknown function Js(r) using basis 
functions defined over the elements, we have reduced the point-wise continuous 
problem of finding Js(r) at every location on s to finding a set of N coefficients that 
best satisfy (2.29). This can be accomplished by weakly enforcing (2.29) at a set of 
Figure 2.6  Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis function defined on a pair of neighboring flat-
triangular elements.

N points on the problem geometry s. This is called point matching (or collocation) 
and it results in an N × N system of linear equations in an. However, the locations 
of the N points are not unique and thus affect that overall accuracy of the resulting 
solution. Typically, the collocation points must be chosen as uniformly as possible 
over the antenna surface.
Alternatively, instead of enforcing (2.29) at a specific set of points on the antenna 
surface, one can use a weighted sum to test it over subdomains. In particular, we may 
use the same basis functions as weights to enforce (2.29). This is called Galerkin’s 
testing, and the idea will be made clear in the following. Using N weighting functions

is the impedance matrix. Evaluation of (2.34) using numerical quadrature is relatively 
simple for plane wave excitations. However, extreme care must be taken in evaluating 
(2.34) since the dyadic Green’s function involves singularities that must be accurately 
treated (see [4] for more details). From (2.34), it is clear that the [Z] matrix is of full 
rank and the storage and solution of large size matrix equations can be computa-
tionally very demanding. For instance, for N = 1,000,000 double precision complex 
storage cost of the [Z] matrix is 1012 × 16/109 = 16,000 GB. Obviously, such a large 
size matrix cannot be stored on the computer random access memory (RAM) and is 
typically stored on the hard disk. For more manageable sizes, direct solution is pre-
ferred when possible. For larger size problems, iterative solvers can be very effective.
2.3.5	
Direct and Iterative Solution Methods
We next proceed to solve the linear system of equations in (2.32) to determine the 
unknown coefficients of the induced surface current expansion (2.28). For smaller 
problems where the system size N is less than a few thousands, direct solution of the 
impedance matrix equation is most effective. For this, the LU decomposition with 
pivoting provides the most cost-effective method with a computational complexity 
of O(N3). Once the impedance matrix is decomposed into [Z] = [L][U], multiple 
incidence angles and excitations can be solved easily in O(N2) operations using 

24
Numerical Methods
back-substitution. For large problems, pivoting must be employed to make sure that 
the LU decomposition does not suffer from round-off errors.
However, in order to ensure accuracy, one often uses a finer mesh discretization 
and ends up with very large MoM systems in the order of millions of unknowns. 
This is a situation also encountered when high-frequency solutions are required for 
electrically large structures. For such large systems, direct solvers can take a prohibi-
tively long time to compute the solution due to the very high O(N3) computational 
complexity. Alternatively, iterative solvers are employed for large linear systems.
For a given excitation vector and an initial guess for {I} = {I0}, iterative solvers 
aim to arrive at the solution through successively updating the initial guess. Several 
matrix-vector products are executed at each iteration and updates to the initial 
guess are computed using different algorithms. Among these, the most popular ones, 
conjugate gradient (CG), conjugate gradient squared (CGS), bi-conjugate gradi-
ent (BiCG), and stabilized bi-conjugate gradient (BiCGStab), are the mostly used, 
gradient-based algorithms. In addition, Krylov subspace methods such as general-
ized minimal residual (GMRES) and quasi-minimal residual (QMR) are also quite 
effective for ill-conditioned problems.
Typically, the computational cost for iterative solvers is O(N2) per iteration due 
to the matrix-vector products involved. So, if the impedance matrix is well condi-
tioned such that the iterative solver converges quickly in a few iterations, then the 
overall solution cost can be kept reasonable. However, we must remember that for 
each new excitation, a new iterative solution is needed. This may increase the simu-
lation time significantly if many different excitations must be considered, such as 
incident fields from different directions. Moreover, if the impedance matrix condition 
number is high, the iterative solution may take a large number of iterations to reach 
a prespecified error tolerance or even fail to converge due to numerical round-off 
errors. Thus, extreme care must be exercised while using iterative solvers. In most 
instances, iterative solvers are used in conjunction with effective preconditioners 
that significantly improve iterative convergence. The catch here is that the construc-
tion and storage cost of the preconditioner should also be low, to justify its benefits. 
This is a current research area, and new numerical and analytical preconditioners 
are becoming available.
Solution of the matrix (2.32) results in current distribution on the surface, which 
can be used to compute near and far fields as well as input impedance and other 
antenna characteristics. An example of current distribution on the bowtie antenna 
is shown in Figure 2.7.
The outline of the MoM was based on purely conducting surfaces. When only 
homogeneous material regions are present within the problem geometry, it is also 
possible to use a surface integral representation and apply the MoM procedure [5]. 
For more general geometries, volume integral equation representations can be used, 
as discussed in Volakis, Sertel, and Usner [6] and Sancer, Sertel, and Volakis [7].

As noted, the surface integral term in (2.42) requires special attention. Unlike 
the MoM where the unknown quantity of interest lives on a bounded domain (such 
as the induced electric currents on the conducting surfaces of the antenna), the FEM 
unknown (the electric field intensity) is nonzero everywhere in space. That is, the 
solution domain is unbounded. However, in practice the solution domain must be 
truncated and the truncation boundary must be handled with care. The simplest 
domain truncation approach is to use the radiation boundary condition,

Note that the above radiation boundary condition is only valid when the domain 
truncation boundary is sufficiently far away from the scatterings centers in the solu-
tion domain such that the total field behaves as an outgoing plane wave. With the 
proper domain truncation such as (2.44), [Y]{V} = {I} can be solved to determine 
unknown coefficients {V} = [a1a2a3…aN]T in (2.36). Incident fields are also incorpo-
rated into the boundary truncation and can be easily handled.

Functional Formalism and Discrete Formulation
A more formal derivation of the FEM is formulated using the electric field functional 
in a source-free region [8–10]:

with the given boundary conditions (∂E = 0 on s). Here, the same basis function 
expansion in (2.36) is used to express E in (2.45) and the stationary condition (2.46) 
results in the same matrix equation [Y]{V} = {I} where the matrix elements are given 
by (2.42) and (2.43). We note here that the resulting [Y] matrix is highly sparse due 
to the local nature of the electric field basis functions. This is one of the main advan-
tages of FEM as it is much easier to store and solve sparse matrices. However, since 
the domain truncation must be chosen sufficiently away from the problem geometry, 
it is necessary to discretize the free-space region around the problem, thus leading 
to large matrix size.
2.4.2	
Material Modeling, Boundary Conditions, and Feed Modeling
The other advantage of FEM is its ability to easily model materials in the solution 
domain. Nonuniform material regions can be easily incorporated into the FEM 
matrix by defining the dielectric permittivity εr(r) and the magnetic permeability 
μr(r) in (2.42). Moreover, PEC surface and volumes within the solution domain are 
modeled by simply zeroing out the tangential electric field unknowns. As such, simply 
removing the PEC finite elements from the mesh results in an accurate representation.
Moreover, the modeling of excitation ports within the finite-element (FE) domain 
is relatively straightforward. Voltage sources can be modeled as impressed, localized 
electric fields. Current sources are simply incorporated into (2.41). Waveguide ports 
can be represented in terms of the electromagnetic distribution of the waveguide 
modes, where a modal expansion is utilized to account for near-zone field distribu-
tion around the feed.
2.4.3	
Discretization and Basis Functions
The basis function expansion in (2.36), representing the unknown electric field 
intensity, must be expressed on a discrete volumetric mesh in order to solve for the 
unknown coefficients in (2.41). Much like the MoM discretization, finite elements 
are first employed to express the problem geometry.
Perhaps the most commonly used volumetric discretization is the tetrahedral 
finite elements, depicted in Figure 2.12. Following a similar approach as in the case 
of flat triangular elements, any point inside the tetrahedral element is represented 
using the normalized volume coordinates,

where r1,…,r4 are the coordinates of the four nodes defining the element.
Vector fields representing the electric field basis functions are concisely defined 
using the normalized coordinates (ξ1,ξ2,ξ3,ξ4). Due to the vector nature of these basis 
functions and their commonplace use in FEM, they are often referred to as vector 
finite elements. For instance, the vector basis function associated with the tetrahedral 
edge joining r4 to r2 is defined as
	
= x — x - x — x
( )
42

(2.48)
The vector functions associated with the remaining three edges can be similarly 
defined. It is important to note that (2.48) defines a vector field that flows along the 
edge joining r4 to r2 and linearly decreases to zero as the observation point moves 
away from the edge. Moreover, the tangential component of (2.48) on edge join-
ing r4 to r2 is independent of the rest of the geometry. This property is an essential 
condition in order to enforce tangential electric field continuity across all elements 
that share a common edge. The spurious resonance problem plagued FEM analysis 
before the advent of vector finite elements and explicitly enforcing tangential con-
tinuity is of paramount importance for avoiding these spurious resonances in FEM 
solution and is readily resolved using vector finite elements.
Various other types of finite elements are also employed in FEM analysis, some 
of which are depicted in Figure 2.13. As seen, higher-order curvilinear elements can 
also be used along with higher-order vector basis function expansions [11].
In order to properly enforce the tangential continuity and construct the FEM 
matrix equation, all common edges in the FEM mesh must be identified prior to 
analysis. Usually, (2.42) is evaluated for each tetrahedral element and this 4 × 4 
matrix is called the element matrix. The entries of the element matrix are then used 
to assemble the global FEM matrix using the mesh connectivity information. As such, 
if a common edge is shared by six finite elements, then six contributions are added 
into the global matrix. This process is called the FEM system assembly and care 
must be exercised during this apparently simple procedure. Particularly, the vector

directions of the individual basis functions residing in each finite element must be 
respected during the assembly.
2.4.3.1	 h- and p- Refinement FEM
Once the matrix is fully populated, direct and iterative matrix solvers are used to 
arrive at the FEM solution. We note here that the overall solution accuracy depend 
on the FEM mesh density, as well as basis function order. Thus, finer FEM meshes 
and/or higher-order basis functions are needed to further improve solution accuracy. 
Moreover, the overall accuracy of the FEM solution usually varies from point-to-point 
in the problem domain. Thus, localized re-meshing (termed as h-refinement) and/
or localized use of higher-order basis functions (termed as p-refinement) is applied 
in modern FEM software. The approach is implemented in an iterative refinement 
fashion, such that a user-defined error criterion is achieved via successive h- and 
p-refinement of a coarse-mesh solution.
2.4.3.2	 Higher-Order Absorbing Boundary Conditions and Perfectly Matched Layers
Since the FEM matrix is highly sparse due to (2.42) being nonzero only over the same 
finite element, iterative solvers are typically employed. Nonetheless, for very large 
problems, the sparse FEM matrix still poses a formidable computational bottleneck. 
Moreover, error propagation (due to the discrete nature of the FEM wave equation) 
may prevent an accurate solution for very large FE domains. In order to keep the 
FEM mesh as small as possible, the mesh truncation boundary must be as close to 
the geometry of interest as possible.
First order radiation condition in (2.44) is not valid when the truncation is close 
to the scattering centers in the problem domain. Higher-order representation of the 
radiation condition is one possibility to improve its accuracy. In addition, fictitious 
absorber layers can be used prevent outgoing waves from returning into the solution 
domain. Perhaps the most widely used artificial absorber is the perfectly matched 
layers (PMLs). These are implemented as fictitious, nonphysical, anisotropic lay-
ers on the truncation boundary and designed to absorb all outgoing wave. With a 
proper implementation, PMLs can significantly reduce the FEM domain by allowing 
the truncation boundary to be placed very close to the problem geometry. However, 
caution must be exercised since PMLs have their own limitations for extremely 
oblique incidences [8, 9].

Hybrid FE-BI and Domain Decomposition Techniques
It is also possible to combine integral equation solvers, such as the MoM, with dif-
ferential equation solvers such as FEM into a hybrid method. Doing so, one can 
take advantage of the strengths of both methods and address solutions of extremely 
complex real-life problems. In essence, highly efficient and accurate analysis tools can 
be developed by combining multiple methods under a hybrid framework. Since both 
the MoM and the FEM are based on similar geometry representations and meshes, 
it is natural to first introduce the hybrid finite-element boundary integral method.
2.5.1	
Hybrid Finite-Element-Boundary Integral (FE-BI) Formulation
As noted above, one of the main challenges in FEM is the accurate truncation of the 
solution domain. The radiation condition (2.44) provides a first-order approximation 
and needs to be applied away from the geometry. Higher-order absorbing boundary 
conditions and PMLs may reduce the computational domain to some extent. An 
alternative and exact way of truncating the FE domain is to use the exact boundary 
conditions given by integral representations [4, 6]. The electric field integral equa-
tion (EFIE) and magnetic field integral equations are given by

A combined field integral equation can be simply obtained by a weighted sum of 
(2.51) and (2.52).
In the hybrid FE-BI approach, the surface magnetic field intensity H in (2.45) is 
treated as an unknown and expressed in terms of a basis expansion as in (2.28). As 
such, three sets of unknowns are identified after the FEM assembly:
• Volumetric electric field intensity Ev;
• Surface electric field intensity Es;
• Surface electric field intensity Hs.

36
Numerical Methods
In order to solve all three uniquely, an additional equation is needed, relating Es 
and Hs, much the same way the radiation condition is used in (2.44). This equation 
is provided by either of the integral representations (2.49) and (2.50). In particular, 
when the CFIE is used, the hybrid FE-BI system takes the form [6] and [12]

where α is an arbitrary CFIE combination parameter. The submatrices in [P] and [Q] 
(2.53) are fully populated matrices coming from the MoM implementation of the 
BI relation. The remaining submatrices are sparse FEM matrices and can be easily 
compressed for storage. Iterative solution of (2.53) is also typically well behaved 
owing to the CFIE used in the BI representation. Other FE-BI hybridizations, starting 
from variational representations can also be found in the literature [13].

To illustrate the use of the hybrid FEM-BI method, we considered dielectric loaded 
helix antenna (Figure 2.15). Dielectric material is analyzed using FEM, whereas the 
boundary of FEM and the metallic parts are analyzed using BI. Discretization of the 
FEM region resulted in 32,218 tetrahedrals and BI portion results in 3,292 triangles. 
Analysis required 457.232 MB memory and 190.634 seconds.

the fully populated MoM matrix grows as O(N2) and iterative solvers require O(N2) 
floating-point operations per iteration. Fast methods improve both of these costs by 
making clever use of the properties of the Green’s function. In particular, the free-

very expensive. However, it is important to note that off-diagonal blocks of the 
[Z] matrix, which represent the interactions between two well-separated groups of 
basis and testing functions, are rank deficient. That is, off-diagonal blocks of the 
[Z] matrix can be further compressed to reduce storage and solution complexity. 
Standard singular value decomposition (SDV)–based compression approaches can 
be applied algebraically, such as the adaptive cross approximation (ACA) method 
to speed-up the MoM solution. However, the fast multipole method (FMM) relies 
on the properties of the Green’s function and allows for an analytic compression of 
the solution process. Next, we describe the key equations leading FMM compres-
sion of the MoM matrix.
2.6.1	
Fast Multipole Method (FMM)
The FMM is based on the expression of the Green’s function in terms of the multi-
pole expansions. Using the vector construct shown in Figure 2.16, we can express 
the scalar Green’s function as

To proceed with the FMM, first all N basis functions are grouped into M groups, 
with respect to their geometrical proximity. Groups that are touching each other are 
considered near-zone, and those that are well separated are considered as far-zone. 
Since (2.63) is only valid for well-separated basis and testing functions, the imped-
ance matrix is partitioned into a sparse near-zone matrix and a far-zone matrix as 
[Z] = [Znear] + [Zfar] using the above grouping. The far-zone interactions are never 
computed, only the near field matrix [Znear] is computed and stored in sparse form 
using the standard MoM implementation (2.60).
In order to compress far-zone matrix [Zfar], the far field signatures of the basis 
and testing functions are also computed and stored using (2.64) and (2.65) for each 
ˆk  sample of the chosen numerical quadrature. The translation operator (2.62) is 
also precomputed and stored.
The FMM-compressed matrix-vector product of [Zfar] proceeds in three steps:
• Aggregation: In this step, all signatures of the basis functions are summed-
up to form the group signature, as outgoing plane wave at prespecified ˆk  
quadrature samples.
• Translation: Outgoing group signatures are converted into incoming group 
signatures for each testing function group.
• Disaggregation: Incoming group signatures are distributed onto each testing 
function and the entries of the multiplication vector are computed.
With N basis function and M groups, the computational complexities of the 
aggregation and disaggregation steps are O(N2/M) whereas that of the transla-
tion stage is O(NM). Also, the near-field matrix vector product cost is O(N2/M). 
The overall cost of the matrix-vector product can thus be minimized by choosing 
N
M
=
, which results in a much reduced O(N1.5) complexity. Compared to the 
O(N2) complexity of the standard MoM matrix-vector product, this may not seem 
like a significant reduction; however, as N increases beyond several tens of thousands, 
Figure 2.16  Vector construct illustrating the FMM expansion (2.61).

this small difference makes a huge impact. Thus, with FMM, much larger MoM 
problems can be solved using less computer resources.
It is also possible to apply the three-step FMM process in a multilevel fashion, 
resulting in the multilevel FMM (MLFMM) by Chew, Jin, and Michielssen [14]. The 
overall complexity of MLFMM further reduces down to O(N logN) for both storage 
and execution. MLFMM has been the workhorse for large-scale MoM modeling and 
full-rank systems of several hundred million unknowns have been solved recently. 
Combination of single-level FMM with fast Fourier transform (FFT) has been shown 
to be highly parallelizable [15], leading to the largest problem size ever solved [16].

To illustrate use of MLFMM, a horn-fed Gregorian axis-symmetrical dual reflector 
is analyzed using commercial software FEKO, as depicted in Figure 2.17. Number of 
unknowns for this problem is 102,332. The problem was solved with a memory of 
1.886GB and took a time of 3133.439 seconds. MoM would have required 80.7GB 
of memory as opposed to 1.886GB required for MLFMM.

Numerical methods described above often result in a system matrix equation such as

(2.66)
where A(k) is the system matrix, x(k) is the solution vector, and v(k) is the excitation 
vector due to the plane wave incident.
Solution of (2.66) at any frequency f0 gives the solution vector x(k0), where k0 
is the free-space wavenumber at f0. Instead of directly solving for x(k0), it can be 
written as a rational function,

If the frequency derivatives are known at more than one frequency, then the 
expansion about k = k0 cannot be used and the system matrix to solve the ratio-
nal function coefficients takes a general form [17]. For the sake of simplicity, let 
us examine a two-frequency model. Assume that at two frequencies, f1 (with free-
space wavenumber k1) and f2 (with free-space wave number k2), four derivatives are 
evaluated at each frequency. Hence ten samples of data are needed (two frequency 
samples and a total of eight derivative samples) to form a rational function with 
L = 5 and M = 4.

The above procedure can be generalized for multiple frequencies with frequency-
derivatives evaluated at each frequency to increase the accuracy of the rational 
function. Alternatively, the two-frequency-four-derivative model can be used with 
multiple frequency windows. In practical applications, one can solve for x(k) in 
(2.74) by simply solving (2.66) at various frequencies.

Example
To illustrate the use of fast-frequency sweep, consider the broadband frequency 
response of bowtie antenna Figure 2.18. Solid trace in Figure 2.18 represents cal-
culations using discrete frequency calculations, whereas the dashed trace represents 
calculations using continuous frequency calculations.
2.7	
High-Frequency Techniques
Full-wave solutions, such as MoM and MLFMM, offer accuracy and flexibly. With 
advances in computer technology, now we have desktop computers that offer 8–16GB 
of memory and 4–16 cores at an affordable price. Despite these advances in com-
puter technology, solving electrically large problems such as very high gain reflec-
tor antenna with a complex feed may be beyond commonly available resources. 
To solve such problems, one will have to use asymptotic methods such as physical 
optics (PO), geometrical optics (GO), geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD), and 
uniform theory of diffraction (UTD). As these techniques are applicable only at high 
frequencies where geometries are electrically large, they are commonly referred to as 
high- frequency techniques [19–21]. In the next section we introduce some of these 
high-frequency techniques along with some examples.
2.7.1	
Physical Optics (PO) and Geometrical Optics (GO)
For electrically large scatterers, where the primary scattering contribution is coming 
from specular reflections (such as large reflector antennas), PO approximation yields

quite accurate answers in the primary radiation direction. Owing to its simplicity, 
it is one of the most widely used techniques for electromagnetic scattering analysis 
in general and in reflector design in particular. The PO approximation is based on 
surface equivalence and locally flat approximation of the reflector surface. Under 
these assumptions, the induced surface current on the antenna is approximated in 
terms of the incident magnetic field intensity as

As seen, only the knowledge of the incident magnetic field and the lit parts of 
the problem geometry is needed to apply PO. The simplicity of the PO implementa-
tion and the accuracy of the solutions for highly directive antennas make PO the 
first choice for approximate analysis of large reflector antennas. The incident field 
Hinc is typically computed from a full-wave analysis. To a first-order approximation, 
the main reflector is illuminated by the computed fields of the feed. Subsequently, 
the radiation in the main beam of the reflector is computed using (2.80) with the 
PO currents from (2.79).
We note that the geometry mesh and MoM basis functions can be incorporated 
into (2.79) such that the mesh of the problem geometry can be used to compute 
JPO via a simply projection similar to (2.33). This mesh-based PO also allows for a 
much more general geometry representation capability. More importantly, hybrid-
ization of MoM and PO becomes more organic since the same basis functions are 
used on both methods.
However, a critical drawback of the PO method is the identification of the lit 
and shadow regions in the problem geometry see Figure 2.19 and 2.20. Ray-tracing 
or Z-buffer based methods are typically applied. Also, since the boundary between 
the lit and shadow regions is abrupt, unwanted diffraction effects are introduced in 
the radiated fields computed via (2.80) and (2.81). This can be alleviated through a 
Figure 2.19  Illustration of the lit- and shadow-regions of the PO and GO approximations.

more sophisticated treatment of the shadow boundaries using the physical theory 
of diffraction (PTD) [22].
On the contrary, in GO the wavefronts of the incident field are associated with 
rays, representing the energy flow direction normal to the wavefronts. Subsequently, 
each ray is traced through the problem domain and the usual ray-matter interactions, 
such as reflections from conducting surfaces and refractions at material boundaries, 
are accounted for. The scattered or reflected fields are computed from the collection 
of rays that arrive at the observation point. GO is highly utilized in optics where 
the optical components such as lenses, reflectors, diffraction gratings, beam-splitters, 
and so on closely obey the ray-tracing rules and the diffraction effects are minimal 
due to the extremely large sizes. A detailed discussion on this subject can be found 
in introductory level optics texts [23].

Geometrical Theory of Diffraction and Uniform  
Theory of Diffraction
As noted above, the GO approximation makes use of a ray-based description of 
electromagnetic energy propagation. For example, for the simple half-plane problem 
illustrated in Figure 2.22, the total GO electric field is written as a sum of incident 
and reflected fields with associated regions of validity as

Obviously, (2.82) introduces abrupt, nonphysical transitions across the incident-

 must be replaced by the appropriate diffraction coefficient 
to compute Ed via (2.86). We note here that by definition the diffraction coefficient 
is only a function of local geometry of the discontinuity in the problem geometry. As 
such, the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) provides a powerful approach to 
analyzing electrically large structures from a purely geometrical perspective, bypass-
ing Maxwell’s equation completely.
Unfortunately, diffraction coefficient given in (2.87) is not uniform, that it, at 
the ISB and RSB (2.87), has a singularity due to ϕ − ϕ′ = π and +ϕ′ = π. Resolution 
of this problem is achieved in the uniform theory of diffraction (UTD)  (Kouyoum-
jian R., 1975). In UTD, a new diffraction coefficient is developed using asymptotic 
approximations of the half-space problem solution, and the resulting UTD diffrac-
tion coefficients are well behaved across ISB and RSB.
The diffraction effects include not only the edge and wedge diffractions but also 
diffraction from curved edges and wedges, creeping waves, as well as slope diffrac-
tion. In general, when the geometry has diffraction centers in close proximity of 
each other, multiple diffraction effects must also be accounted for, for an accurate 
analysis. UTD is perhaps one of the most widely utilized tools for reflector antenna

Introduction
This chapter deals with small feeds, which are mainly developed for prime focus 
reflectors. They have been mostly waveguide based, but planar configurations, using 
microstrip patch or dipole antennas, have also been investigated. In this form, they 
are small, with respect to the wavelength, and relatively easy to fabricate by the 
printed circuit technology. However, they can also be used in array forms, which 
allow radiation pattern shaping, but at the expense of increasing the feed size. In the 
following sections, initially, a brief background is provided, which is followed by 
the waveguide-based designs and then by the planar configurations. For complete-
ness, a case of asymmetric feeds for offset prime focus reflectors is also discussed 
at the end of the chapter. More detailed coverage of asymmetric feeds is provided 
later in Chapter 8.
The early feeds were based on simple antenna configurations to facilitate their 
design. They were also designed mostly for radar applications and required high-
power capability. Thus, open-ended waveguides and dipoles were selected for such 
applications. In the former case, small flare angles were used to control the wave-
guide radiation patterns and match the aperture impedance to that of free space. In 
the latter case, planar disks were utilized to direct the dipole radiation field toward 
the reflector [1]. However, they performed poorly as feeds for reflector antennas, 
which resulted in low aperture efficiencies, and high cross polarizations. Further 
improvements in the performance of these feeds were achieved by altering the con-
figurations and combining their unique design features, which resulted in smaller, 
simpler, and more efficient feeds such as the Cutler feed [2] and Calvin feed [3]. 
These feeds performed better, but they were not optimum. Additional improvements 
were achieved by inclusion of higher order modes in the waveguides, such as the 
Potter horns [4, 5] or the excitation of hybrid modes [5, 6]. The latter designs were 
achieved by investigation of the focal plane field of reflector antennas, and enforcing 
the reciprocity principle, to identify the feed aperture field, by matching the aperture 
field of the feed to that of the reflector focal plane field.

Another important factor in the design of early feeds was the limitations in avail-
ability of efficient computation tools, which influenced the solutions and favored 
the analytic and asymptotic techniques. In turn, they helped in understanding the 
physical principles behind the operation of reflector antennas and the importance 
of various feed parameters. However, analytic formulations and most simplifying 
approximations are valid in the asymptotic sense, and in the case of reflector feeds, 
they have helped in accurate design of large aperture feeds. Such feeds are normally 
used in dual reflector antennas, which require narrow angle illumination for their 
subreflectors.
The prime focus reflectors, on the other hand, must support the feed and the 
receiver assembly at their focal point, which will cause aperture blockage and perfor-
mance degradation. In such cases, deeper reflector geometries are favored to reduce 
the blockage, which in turn require small-size feeds in terms of the wavelength. The 
aperture dimensions of most feeds in this category fall around one to two wave-
lengths, where asymptotic approximations are invalid or inaccurate. Experimental 
or numerical methods must be used. They require anechoic chambers, which are 
costly to install, or accurate numerical codes, which were not available to antenna 
engineers until quite recently. The development of efficient small feeds for prime 
focus reflectors, therefore, had to wait until numerical techniques, based on moment 
and finite-element methods or the finite-difference time-domain method became 
available to the antenna engineering community. Their small sizes make them ideal 
candidates for design and optimizations by such numerical codes.
The conceptual design of small feeds for prime focus reflectors was helped by 
the analysis of focal plane fields of parabolic reflectors [7], which showed that they 
can be expressed in terms of hybrid modes. This led to the development of several 
feeds that could support hybrid modes, such as the corrugated horns, dielectric 
loaded horns, and, recently, metamaterial horns. The corrugated horns were the 
most successful designs and found applications in both large and small aperture 
horns. Until recently they were unchallenged in terms of performance. The latter 
metamaterial horns are still in their infancy and have not been studied extensively 
yet, but they show advantages in cost, weight, and performance over corrugated 
horns and promises for large-scale applications. Their design and performance are 
investigated in Chapter 6.
The excitation and investigation of hybrid modes using corrugated horns 
have been reported by Clarricoats and Olver [8] and Minnett and Thomas [9]. 
Experimentally, they were designed and studied by Kay [10] and Koch [11]. The 
former used passive corrugations on the inside wall of a conical horn to influence 
the wall surface impedance and consequently the horn aperture field distribu-
tion. The latter used active corrugations, excited through slots and probes on the 
wall of the feeding waveguide, to control the aperture field distribution over the 
surface of the waveguide flange. A similar design, but with considerably simpler 
configuration, was developed by Wohlleben [12] and James [13], in which the 
corrugations were excited directly through aperture coupling. The advantage of 
the latter two feeds is in the independence of the corrugated flange surface from 
the waveguide that can be moved axially, with respect to each other, to control 
the feed radiation patterns.

Design Requirements

The real breakthrough in design of small prime focus reflector feeds happened 
with realization of the fact that the dominant mode in circular waveguides can be 
excited by a transverse dipole source on their axis, and that the azimuth depen-
dence of the radiated fields is separated from the other coordinates and governed 
by simple sine or cosine functions. The former reduced the computation time for 
electromagnetic analysis of the feeds, and the latter allowed altering the radiated field 
simply by shaping the transverse cross section of the feed. Consequently, numerical 
analysis and optimization of the feeds became reality even with small computers, 
and efficient feeds with low cross polarization were investigated and designed. For a 
good summary of such studies and design of various efficient feeds, see Olver, Clar-
ricoats, Kishk, and Shafai [14] for a dedicated manuscript on microwave horns and 
feeds. The development of more-efficient numerical methods and advancements in 
the computer technology further facilitated the feed design and investigation, but 
the fundamental principles have remained the same; only techniques for achieving 
these goals are different, which are discussed separately in the following chapters.
3.2	
Design Requirements
Fundamentally, there are three main requirements for the design of high-performance 
feeds for symmetric reflector antennas:
1.	 Low cross polarization;
2.	 Phase center uniqueness;
3.	 High antenna gain factor.
Low cross polarization: The condition of low cross polarization can be met by 
balancing the radiation from electric and magnetic currents. Since this chapter deals 
with small feeds, their aperture fields can be approximated by electric and magnetic 
dipoles, having the following co-polar and cross-polar radiations.

As shown in Chapter 1, the cross polarization will cancel when the radiation 
from the electric and magnetic dipoles equalizes. For example, in an open-ended 
waveguide, the cross polarization decreases by increasing its radius, due to a reduc-
tion in the wall current, until the radius approaches 0.6λ, where λ is the wavelength 
in the medium [14]. At this point, provided higher order modes are not excited, 
the waveguide is equivalent to a quasi-Huygen source. This implies that the back 
radiation is also minimized [14]. The same is true for a microstrip patch antenna. 
As it will be shown later in this chapter, the cross polarization will decrease as the 
ground plane size increases from the patch size until the magnetic dipole radiation 
from the substrate balances the electric dipole radiation of the patch. This means 
that regardless of the patch size, which depends on the substrate permittivity, the 
cross polarization will decrease initially until it minimizes at a ground plane size 
near one wavelength, the exact size being dependent on the substrate permittivity.
The preceding rule of balancing the electric and magnetic dipoles also applies 
to other and more complex configurations, such as corrugated walls and flanges. In 
the absence of an optimization code, this information helps in rapid design of low 
cross polarization feeds.
Phase center uniqueness: The phase center uniqueness is an important feed design 
parameter but is often neglected. Equalizing the principal plane amplitude patterns 
guarantees neither low cross polarization nor high gain factor, unless the phase 
patterns are also equalized to unify the feed phase centers in the principal planes.
High antenna gain factor: An elegant way of determining a feed design for insur-
ing high antenna gain factor is to match the aperture field of the feed to the focal 
plane field of the reflector, when illuminated by a plane wave [7]. For an aperture 
antenna, this is in the form of J(x)/x, which is also the focal plane field of a para-
bolic reflector with a small subtended angle. The actual focal plane field, however, is 
somewhat different (shown in Figure 3.1), for different reflector subtended angles. 
In circular reflector apertures, these field intensities correspond to Airy disks, with 
alternating positive and negative intensities, which continue to infinity. However, 
because of the diminishing intensities, the first few peaks (normally less than three) 
are used to design practical feeds. This focal plane field truncation influences the 
design and reduces the achievable reflector gain factors. Nevertheless, this is the most 
practical design approach to maximize the reflector gain factor while minimizing 
the feed size and its aperture blockage.
In a vectorial representation, the field distribution, corresponding to three Airy 
disks, or the main lobe and two sidelobes of the focal plane field, up to the third null, 
resembles the plot shown in Figure 3.2. It is evident that the field cross polarization 

3.2

is zero. Such a field distribution can be provided by hybrid modes in a corrugated 
waveguide [7], or a combination of the dominant and higher order modes in a 
smooth wall waveguide [11].
Using the preceding methods, Koch [11] has systematically synthesized feeds 
with properly excited waveguides and rings. To eliminate the higher order modes, 
as many as 12 longitudinal slots around the waveguide have been used to excite

the required TM11 and TE12 modes. This is an excellent example of science-based 
antenna design. However, the designs are complex and costly to fabricate.
In waveguides with shorted rings (such as chokes), the coupling between the 
waveguide and rings is strong and can be controlled by their dimensional parameters. 
Analytic solutions are normally beyond the reach, but the problem can be handled 
numerically with available software packages. Since passive chokes are consider-
ably easier to fabricate, they have been used in most practical small feed designs. In 
the following sections, a summary is provided (though by no means complete) that 
includes the most successful designs so far used in practice.
3.3	
Waveguide Feeds
Antennas are generally easier to design for forward radiation, and the reflector feeds 
are no exception. For this reason, most reflector feeds, especially the high-performance 
ones, are designed for forward radiation. However, in prime focus reflectors the feed 
must be at the focal point, which is in front of the reflector and causes aperture block-
age. In addition, the feed needs supporting struts that contribute to more blockage. 
Fortunately, with small feeds this is not a major issue, but nevertheless it limits the 
reflector performance. For these reasons, offset reflector geometries are considered 
to eliminate the blockage and improve the reflector performance. While this solution 
eliminates the blockage and improves the reflector gain and sidelobe performance, 
the asymmetry of the reflector geometry contributes to cross polarization. Thus, 
there is a merit for designing backward-radiating feeds that can be installed from 
the reflector center, to eliminate the supporting struts and their blockage. However, 
as indicated, the design of such backward-radiating feeds is more complex and influ-
ences their performance. In this section, we will discuss both feed types, but more 
attention will be focused on forward radiating feeds and their design optimization. 
A representative backward-radiating feed will also be presented and discussed.
Because of geometrical simplicity, and high power handling capability, most 
forward-radiating feeds are waveguide based. Circular waveguides are preferred, 
as their hybrid modes can generate efficient reflector illumination with low cross 
polarization [7]. Also, as shown in the previous section, the combination of the first 
two modes in smooth wall waveguides can provide excellent reflector illuminations 
with low cross polarization. These properties favor the use of circular waveguides as 
preferred reflector feeds. However, circular waveguides have one important property, 
not present in other waveguides, which is the separation of the radial and azimuth 
wave functions. This means that their aperture field and wall currents will also depend 
on separate azimuth and transverse wave functions. The significance of this property 
is in the fact that their outside wall can be shaped, in the form of corrugated flanges, 
or other profiles, to shape their radiated field, minimize the cross polarization, and 
unify their phase centers in various planes. In other words, small feeds are designed 
with excellent radiation properties.
A similar principle can also be used in microstrip antennas, where shaping of 
the ground plane can be used to improve the radiation patterns. This can also be 
explained in terms of Huygen source equivalence, as discussed earlier. The shaping 
of the waveguide outside wall provides an opportunity for balancing the electric and 

3.3

magnetic dipole radiations to improve the feed characteristics. Because this form 
of radiated field optimization is based on the aperture field coupling, the resulting 
geometry is normally simpler in shape and easier to fabricate. Small physical size 
of the feed also simplifies the design optimization. Consequently, nearly all small 
reflector feeds are based on circular waveguides with corrugated or shaped flanges. 
Their design and performance are discussed next.
3.3.1	
Small Waveguide Feeds
Even though a waveguide is not an ideal feed for reflector antennas, it is discussed 
here to show the steps involved in the design process. Figure 3.3(a) shows the geom-
etry of an open-ended waveguide, excited by the dominant TE11 mode. Adding a 
choke on the outside wall, Figure 3.3(b), brings the contribution of the second ring 
of the focal plane field (shown in Figure 3.1), and a quarter wavelength choke also 
increases the surface impedance near the wall edge that considerably reduces the 
edge diffraction and its subsequent side and back lobe levels in the radiation pat-
terns. Figure 3.4 shows the resulting 10 dB beamwidths of the radiation patterns in 
the two principal planes. It is evident that the pattern symmetry of the waveguide 
without the choke improves as its radius increases, which is as a result of balancing 
the contribution of aperture electric and magnetic dipole fields. The corresponding 
cross polarizations in the 45° plane are shown in Figure 3.5, which for a waveguide 
without the choke decreases continuously until the waveguide radius of a = 0.6λ, 
where the next higher order mode TM01 becomes excited. A sample of the princi-
pal plane radiation patterns, along with the cross polarization in the 45° plane, are 
shown in Figure 3.6, for a waveguide with a half wavelength radius of a = 0.5λ. The 
excellent symmetry of the patterns is evident, which provides a low cross polariza-
tion level of below −30 dB.
As Figure 3.4 shows, the 10 dB beamwidths for a waveguide with a choke are 
narrower than those of the waveguide without a choke and equalize earlier in the 
principal planes around the radius of a = 0.4λ. Similarly, the peak cross polarization 
also minimizes earlier at about the same waveguide radius of a = 0.4λ, with signifi-
cantly lower values of around −36 dB. Figure 3.7 shows its principal plane radiation 
patterns, with the cross polarization in the diagonal plane and the back lobe levels 
decreased significantly. To understand the influence of the choke on the back lobe 
level, they are compared for a waveguide with and without a choke in Figure 3.8.

It is clear that the introduction of a single choke decreases the back lobe level by 
about 10 dB. In addition, in both cases the back lobe level decreases continuously by 
increasing the waveguide radius, until the excitation of the TM01 mode at a = 0.6λ.
The phase center locations for the waveguides with and without a choke are 
shown in Figure 3.9 [16]. Here, dc in the vertical axis is the distance of the waveguide 
aperture from the phase center location. Thus, from the geometry of Figure 3.3, 
when the phase center is in front of the aperture, that is, outside of the waveguide, 
dc becomes negative, and when it is inside the waveguide it is positive. The case of 
the waveguide without the choke, in Figure 3.9(a), is quite interesting. Here, the

currents on the outside of the waveguide wall are strong, especially when the wave-
guide radius approaches its cut-off value, which runs backward. The phase center 
location is therefore influenced strongly by this current and changes its location 
with the aperture angle. However, as the waveguide diameter increases, the percent-
age of its aperture radiation increases, and the phase center location moves to the 
waveguide aperture, where its location becomes independent of the direction. This 
uniqueness of the phase center location is manifested in the cross polarization reduc-
tion, as shown in Figure 3.5. The phase center location of the choked waveguide, 
shown in Figure 3.9(b), on the other hand, is more stable with the aperture angle 
and is generally outside the waveguide aperture. This is a clear indication that the 
quarter wavelength choke pushes the aperture field away from the waveguide wall.
The gain factor (the feed efficiency) performances of these simple feeds are shown 
in Figure 3.10(a) and (b), for the waveguide without and with a quarter wavelength 
choke. They are almost the same, being slightly higher for the waveguide with a 
choke, as shown numerically in Table 3.1.
The preceding results for the open-ended waveguide without and with a choke 
demonstrated two important facts. One, the performance of the feed in pattern uni-
formity, low cross polarization, and consequently the uniqueness of the phase center

location improves by increasing the waveguide diameter, until the next higher order 
mode becomes excited, after a = 0.6λ. Second, using even a single quarter wavelength 
choke reduces the waveguide edge diffraction and waveguide outside wall currents 
sufficiently, to further lower the cross polarization and especially the back radia-
tion. In practice, the choke height, depth, and location from the waveguide edge 
can be used as additional design parameters to modify the beamwidth or other feed 
parameters. In particular, recessing the choke, that is, moving it behind the wave-
guide aperture, will broaden the beamwidth, which can be used as a parameter to 
match the feed performance to a chosen reflector.
Adding more chokes will further enhance their influence on the radiation pat-
terns and the feed performance. For instance, more chokes will capture more powers 
from the sidelobes of the focal plane field in Figure 3.1, to increase the gain factor. 
Similarly, more chokes further diminish the waveguide wall currents and reduce the 
back radiation. However, the most important factor in using additional chokes is in 
providing additional parameters to the feed design, to allow further feed performance 
optimizations. For instance, recessing the chokes progressively broadens the feed 
radiation patterns. Conversely, moving the chokes to the front of waveguide aper-
ture, to form a corrugated conical horn, will reduce its beamwidth. Obviously, one 
needs not to move the chokes linearly to form forward or backward corrugated horn. 
The corrugation chokes can be moved in a nonlinear fashion to generate undulated 
corrugated waveguide flanges and thus provide additional parameters for optimiza-
tion. Similarly, the choke shape need not be only rectangular; other shapes, such as 
trapezoidal, sinusoidal, or even arbitrary shapes, can also be selected. By optimizing 
their dimensions, feeds with high performance can be easily designed. We provide 
the parameters for the two special cases of waveguides with three rectangular or 
trapezoidal chokes. Their geometries are shown in Figure 3.11. Their radiation pat-
terns, phase center locations, and gain factors are shown in Figures 3.12–3.14. The 
beamwidths are somewhat smaller than those of the waveguide with a single choke 
and have lower back lobe levels. The gain factors of the trapezoidal choke feed are 
slightly higher than those of the rectangular one. The gain factors are quite stable 
as L increases, where L is the distance between the apertures of the waveguide and 
the chokes. By adding more chokes, the relative size increases, resulting in further 
aperture blockage. Thus, it may not be suitable for applications in small reflectors.
An example of shaping the radiation patterns by moving multiple chokes with 
respect to each other is shown in Figure 3.15(a) and (b), which is designed for 
operation in the X-band, from 8 to 12.4 GHz. The second choke is moved slightly 
forward to reduce its −10 dB beamwidth to about 90°, resulting in a waveguide 
with a corrugated cone. At the upper end of the band, the radiation patterns and 
cross polarization are shown in Figure 3.16, and its performance improves as the 
frequency decreases. The beamwidth is decreased considerably from the case of a 
waveguide with a single choke. The back lobe level could be decreased further by 
embedding a narrow choke on the upper wall. Further reduction of the beamwidth 
can be accomplished by adding more chokes and moving the chokes farther ahead, 
resulting in a corrugated cone, and shown in Figure 3.15(c), where six corrugations 
are used and its −10 dB beamwidth is reduced to 50°. Since both feeds cover a full 
waveguide band, they can be scaled to other frequencies, such as the 20–30 GHz 
satellite band.

3.3.2	
Small Coaxial Feeds
Coaxial waveguides offer additional parameters for optimization. The mode struc-
tures are more complex, and the desired TE11 mode must be excited by an appropriate 
feed transition, such as a rectangular waveguide or multiple probes, to eliminate the 
dominant coaxial mode. However, they offer a unique advantage in the possibility 
of using the central conductor as another feed. Depending on the proximity of the 
two bands, the central conductor can be used with air or a dielectric loaded circular 
waveguide. In the latter case, the loading dielectric can be shaped to improve the

feed radiation characteristics [17]. Using such an approach, a dual band feed has 
been designed for operation in the two adjacent 4 and 6 GHz bands. Its geometry is 
shown in Figure 3.17, and its radiation patterns and the gain factors are depicted in 
Figures 3.18 and 3.19, respectively. The coaxial region operates in the lower 4 GHz 
band, and the dielectric loaded central region operates in the upper 6 GHz band. 
The dielectric extension is used to equalize the principal plane patterns and move 
the phase center of the upper band to the location of the lower band, which is in 
front of the waveguide aperture. On the outer wall, a quarter wavelength choke is 
used to improve the radiation characteristics of the coaxial feed, and an iris is incor-
porated to improve both the radiation patterns and the impedance bandwidth. It is 
clear from Figure 3.18 that the feed performs well in both bands, and good pattern 
symmetry is established in both bands. The gain factors in Figure 3.19 show slight 
advantage of the lower 4 GHz band. But this was done intentionally to maximize its 
gain. At the higher band, the reflector is larger and gives sufficient gains. This design 
demonstrates the challenges one must consider in designing dual- or multi-band feeds. 
The phase centers must be coincident, and the feed performance must be satisfac-
tory in both bands, including the required isolation of the two bands and the input

the input ports for the two bands are geometrically separated.
3.3.3	
Small Wide Angle Feeds
Designing feeds for deep reflectors, especially when F/D is at or near 0.25, corre-
sponding to a reflector half-subtended angle of 90°, is challenging. Pattern symmetry, 
low cross polarization, and the phase center uniqueness must be maintained over 
the entire range of this large aperture angle. In addition, the edge distance from the 
focus is twice the focal length and gives 6 dB spherical wave attenuation. This results 
in poor aperture illuminations and low gain factors. The latter can be remedied to 
some degree by placing a shallow axial null in the radiation patterns of the feed. 
While this is feasible by creating an array factor between the waveguide aperture 
radiation and the choke-radiated field, it often creates a phase center problem and 
an increased cross polarization [14]. Thus, the design must be handled with care. 
In using circular waveguide as a feed, the easiest way of placing an axial null in the 
radiation patterns is to increase the choke width to form a coaxial cavity around 
the waveguide. Then, by a dimensional optimization, one can cause a phase reversal 
between the waveguide and cavity radiations while maintaining satisfactory phase 
center location and minimizing the cross polarization. A representative design is 
shown in Figure 3.20, with its radiation patterns and cross polarization in Figure 
3.21. There is an axial null of 6 dB and good pattern symmetry until beyond 90° 
aperture angle, over which the cross polarization is maintained below −30 dB. The 
back lobe level can similarly be lowered by an incorporation of a quarter wavelength 
choke on the outer wall, as shown in Figure 3.22.

To further broaden the radiation patterns, the waveguide diameter needs to be 
reduced, which can be done by a dielectric loading, as shown in Figure 3.23. The 
radiation patterns of this feed, without and with an outside wall choke, are shown 
in Figure 3.24. The gain factor performance of these feeds is compared in Figure 
3.25, where Feeds 2 and 3 are the designs in Figures 3.20 and 3.23. As observed, 
the aperture angle of Feed 3, at which the peak gain factor occurs, increases to 74° 
from 64°, corresponding to that of Feed 2.
It should be noted that for these feeds, as shown in Figure 3.25, the gain factors 
do not drop rapidly beyond the aperture angle for the peak gain factor, which is due 
to the small size of these feeds. Since the antenna noise temperature decreases by 
increasing the reflector aperture angle, the performance of reflectors with these feeds 
will in fact improve by selecting reflectors with larger aperture angles, especially for 
the dielectric loaded feed of Figure 3.23.

3.3.4  Small Backfire Feeds
A second class of feeds that are especially useful with small reflector antennas are 
back radiating feeds that can be mounted directly on the reflector from a hole on its 
apex. Consequently, they do not need special strut supports, which eliminate their 
aperture blockage. The early design of such feeds were introduced by Silver [1], 
known as dipole-disk antennas. The disk was used to eliminate the back radiation. 
An improvement on this feed was made by feeding the dipole by a reduced height 
waveguide and replacing the disk by a cylindrical cavity, known as the Calvin feed 
[3]. For circular polarization the dipole was replaced by two orthogonal dipoles [18, 
19] and modest performance was obtained. Later, numerical computations were 

3.3	
Waveguide Feeds

used to optimize the dipole-disk performance. Kildal [20] introduced a beamform-
ing ring, in front of the dipole-disk assembly, to equalize its principal plane patterns. 
Shafai [21] equalized the principal plane patterns by replacing the disk by a coni-
cal reflector. The cone parameters were then used to shape the radiation patterns, 
for improving the reflector gain factor, and reduction of the cross polarization. The 
back lobe level was reduced by incorporating a choke on the cone wall. The geom-
etry of the dipole feed and its radiation patterns are shown in Figure 3.26. Other 
backward-radiating feeds have also been investigated, which include the cup feeds 
[22, 23], hat feed [24], and splash plate feeds [25, 26]. The circularly polarized ver-
sions are discussed later in Chapter 7. As a representative example of these feeds, in 
the following section a modified version of the cup feed is presented and discussed. 
It was designed by Kishk and Shafai [27] for low sidelobe applications with small 
reflector antennas in the frequency range of 5.725–5.875 GHz.

3.3.4.1  Modified Cup Feed
The photographs of the feed itself and assembled reflector and the feed are shown in 
Figure 3.27. The feed is assembled on a 45 cm reflector by its feeding circular wave-
guide, without additional struts, thus reducing the blockage. In addition, to obtain 
low sidelobe levels, the waveguide is loaded with a dielectric material of εr = 2.5 to 
reduce its subreflector size. As a result, the subreflector is accommodated in front of 
the waveguide aperture, which is tapered, as shown in Figure 3.27(a). To mechani-
cally support the subreflector, the dielectric material, which had a cylindrical shape, 
is extended by about one wavelength beyond the waveguide aperture. The subre-
flector shape itself has a small inner conducting cone to improve the return loss of 
the feed. The loading dielectric is also tapered inside the waveguide to improve the 
return loss when excited by the TE11 mode.
The primary radiation patterns of the feed, computed by the method of moment 
surface integral equations [14], are shown in Figure 3.28. The small undulations of the

amplitude pattern of the feed are due to the waveguide tapering. Also, the observed 
phase variation within the reflector angular range is about 23°, which results in a 
gain loss of 0.1 dB. The optimum phase center location of the feed is plotted in Fig-
ure 3.29, against the reflector half-subtended angle. It is evident that the phase center 
location of the feed is nearly invariant, for the half-subtended angle range of 60–80°.
The computed and measured radiation patterns of the feed-reflector assembly, 
on a 45 cm reflector with an F/D = 0.375, are illustrated in Figure 3.30, at the oper-
ating frequency of 5.75 GHz. The measurement was done in the Compact Antenna 
Test Range at the University of Manitoba. Good agreement between the results is 
observed. However, nonzero axial cross polarization seen in the measurement, Fig-
ure 3.30(b), is due to the cross polarization of the compact range and not the feed-
reflector assembly. Also, the near-in sidelobe levels are less than −20 dB, while the 
far-out sidelobes diminish monotonically.

74
Electrically Small Feeds
Summarizing the results, the optimized rear-radiating feeds, using dipoles and 
cup feeds, are good alternatives to forward radiating waveguide feeds. Although 
their performances do not match those of the latter, their low profile and simpler 
assembly on the reflector compensate for their deficiencies. Consequently, they are 
preferred in small reflectors.
3.4	
Microstrip Feeds
Microstrip antennas are low profile, lightweight, and easy to fabricate. They also 
have potential to be low cost. However, they have not found widespread applications 
as reflector feeds, because of difficulty in shaping their radiation patterns, without 
altering their low profile, or using arrays. With a single feed, they also excite higher 
order modes that contribute to cross polarization. In spite of these limitations, simple 
primary feeds, using microstrip patch antennas, have been designed and studied [28], 
and good performance obtained. On the other hand, they can also offer advantages. 
Microstrip antennas can be designed to operate wideband, multiband, and form 
small arrays for shaping the beam or generating multiple beams. What is important, 
therefore, is to understand their radiation properties and find simple methods to 
achieve good feed performance. Parameters that are available to the designer are the 
substrate permittivity and the ground plane size and shape, and their modifications 
have been used, recently, to develop efficient designs [29–31].
3.4.1	
Single Patch Antenna as the Reflector Feed
As a small feed, a single circular patch antenna operating at its dominant TM11 
mode is a natural choice. However, other patch shapes can equally be used. Nor-
mally, the operating frequency is determined by the patch size and substrate per-
mittivity, but the radiation pattern shape is controlled by the ground plane. With 
a common substrate permittivity such as εr = 2.5, large ground planes give asym-
metric principal plane patterns, and small ones cause large back radiations. Some-
where in between, a suitable ground plane size can be determined, satisfactory for 
both. However, even with large ground planes, reducing the substrate permittivity 
gradually equalizes the principal plane patterns [14, 29, 32, 33]. Thus, for a given 
substrate permittivity there can be an optimum ground plane size for symmetric 
radiation patterns and low back lobe level. Symmetric radiation patterns can also 
be obtained by shaping the ground plane, but it will affect its low-profile charac-
teristic [31–33].
3.4.1.1	 Pattern Optimization by Substrate Material and Ground Plane Size
The geometry of a typical circular patch antenna is shown in Figure 3.31, where 
R is the radius of the patch and RGr is the radius of the ground plane. A circular 
microstrip patch usually operates in one of the TMmn modes, and the TM11 mode is 
the most practical one. This mode radiates in the broadside direction with a good 
gain and small patch size. At this mode, the antenna generates the field patterns that

are considerably different in the principal E- and H-planes. For εr = 1, pattern equal-
ization is difficult to achieve and is omitted here. For εr = 1.5, when RGr ≈ 0.7λo, cir-
cular symmetric patterns are achieved with reasonably low cross polarization. The 
phase variation between two principal plane patterns is also small for this ground 
plane size, as can be noticed in Figure 3.32. For larger

 beyond θ = ±30°. RGr = 
0.35λo provides almost equal principal plane patterns with reasonably small phase 
variations up to 60°. For larger εr, smaller ground plane size is required to obtain 
pattern symmetry. However, the back radiation increases, as can be noticed in Figure 
3.34, which can be minimized by using a choke on the ground plane. This suggests 
that for a given substrate permittivity, a particular ground plane size gives nearly 
circular symmetric patterns with low cross polarization and phase variations. Figure 
3.35 shows the best ground plane size to obtain symmetric feed patterns, for up to at 
least 70°, from a circular patch antenna operating at the TM11 mode and different εr.
The circular patch antenna on a substrate having εr = 2.5 and h = 1.59 mm with 
the optimized ground plane size (RGr = 0.35λo) is used as the feed to calculate spill-
over, illumination efficiencies, and the overall gain factor, for different F/D ratios 
of the reflector antenna, and tabulated in Table 3.3. The gain factor increases as 
F/D increases, reaches its peak when F/D = 0.375, and then decreases. The varia-
tions in gain factor with aperture angle for different εr are shown in Figure 3.36(a). 
For εr = 2.5, the peak gain factor is achieved at an aperture angle of 67.5°, and for 
εr = 10, it peaks at 80°, which is suitable for deep reflectors. The variation of the 
phase center with aperture angle is plotted in Figure 3.36(b) for different εr. The 
phase center is located just above the patch for all cases.

3.4.1.2	 Pattern Control by Ground Plane Shape
The change in ground plane shape also provides symmetric radiation patterns and 
reduces the back radiation [31]. A simple example is a circular patch antenna with 
the rim around the ground plane edge, which creates a cavity structure, as shown 
in Figure 3.37(a). The rim around the ground plane limits the amount of radia-
tion to the sides and back. Here, the rim has a height r = 0.4λo and wall thickness 
d = 0.1λo. The radiation pattern of this structure is shown in Figure 3.37(b), which 
shows excellent pattern symmetry, over the entire upper hemisphere. In lieu of the 
cross polarization, the axial ratio for circular polarization is provided, which over 
the same range is below 2 dB, indicating that the feed can also be used for circular 
polarization. For further reduction of back radiation, a quarter wavelength choke 
can be employed at the rim wall. With a single choke, the back radiation can be 
lowered by as much as 10 dB, as shown in Figure 3.8.
3.4.1.3	 Bandwidth Control of Microstrip Feeds
A single patch antenna has only a few percent bandwidth, which is useful as feeds 
for narrowband system. If larger bandwidths are required, coupled patches, or patch-
slot combinations, may be used. If the resonant frequencies of two coupled patches

are nearly the same, a wide impedance bandwidth can be achieved by adjusting their 
coupling. The coupled patches can be considered as a single wideband microstrip 
antenna, which can be used alone or in an array. However, to be used as a reflector 
feed, symmetric patterns with low cross polarization must be achieved, which can 
be obtained by choosing an appropriate substrate permittivity and ground plane 
size, as discussed in previous sections.
An example is shown in Figure 3.38. The antenna has low cross polarization 
below −25 dB. An optimized feed with stacked circular patch antenna on a finite 
ground with a choke was fabricated and measured by Kishk and Shafai [29]. The 
calculated results with the feed geometry are shown in Figure 3.39(a), and the mea-
sured patterns are shown in Figure 3.39(b). It provides equal E-plane and H-plane 
co-polar patterns and low cross polarization in the ϕ = 45° plane.
3.4.2	
Planar Antenna Array Feeds
Planar antennas simplify the array formation, which may be required for radiation 
pattern shaping or for improving the reflector performance. The simplification may 
be in the feed structure at high frequencies, in geometrical simplicity, in beamform-
ing networks, or reduction in size and weight [34–37]. The advantages, however, 
must be significant to necessitate their use. The reason is that the material properties 
for fabricating planar antennas are seldom repeatable, and fabrication tolerances, 
especially using the conventional etching or metallization, are normally poor. As a 
result, the performance of planar arrays seldom matches those of conventional feeds. 
Nevertheless, applications may arise that favor their use [38–42]. Here an example 
is provided, at millimeter wave frequencies, where waveguide or microstrip patch 
feeds are impractical.

Backfire Printed Dipole Feeds

An array feed of printed dipoles consisting of two dipoles integrated on a dielec-
tric membrane and backed by a ground plane was presented in Flilipovic, Ali-Ahmad, 
and Rebeiz [43]. The design frequency of the feed was 246 GHz. The radiation pat-
terns of the array feed were made circularly symmetric by appropriately choosing 
the antenna lengths, the antenna spacing, and the ground plane distance from the 
membrane. Two dipoles were integrated at the center of a coplanar stripline with an 
impedance of 300Ω. The feed had a 10% bandwidth, with 10 dB beamwidth of 78°, 
and a directivity of 11.7 dBi. Its measured cross polarization was less than −22 dB at 
30–35°. The test dipole array antenna, designed for a wavelength of 119μm to feed 
a 30λ parabolic reflector, provided a gain of 37 dBi. This corresponds to an overall 
gain factor of 55%, a significant achievement at this frequency.
3.5	
Backfire Printed Dipole Feeds
The planar feeds so far presented were forward-radiating antennas, requiring a 
supporting arm. In this section, we present the design of a printed dipole feed with 
a dipole-reflector, to act as a backward-radiating antenna. The antenna design fol-
lows those in Zheng et al. and Eldek, Eisherbeni, and Smith [44–46], except that 
the antenna main beam is directed backward, toward the feed transmission line, for 
backward radiation. Therefore, it can be mounted on a parabolic reflector, directly 
from its apex, using a simple support, thereby eliminating the need for strut supports 
and their blockage. Hence, the overall reflector-feed mounting system is simple and 
low cost to implement.
The simulation and analysis for the presented feed antennas were performed 
using a finite element three-dimensional (3-D) full wave simulator. To confirm the 
simulation results, prototype feeds were fabricated and tested on a parabolic reflec-
tor. The available reflector was a deep dish with F/D = 0.25, and a small diameter 
of D = 45cm. This feed has a wider H-plane pattern than the E-plane and thus is 
suitable for reflectors with an elliptic aperture. However, as it will be shown later, it 
provided a respectable performance even on a symmetric reflector.
3.5.1	
Design Approach
The geometry and coordinate system of the proposed feed antenna are shown in 
Figure 3.40. The antenna is designed for operation at 3 GHz and is printed on a 
substrate with metallization on both sides. The two arms of the dipole antenna act 
as a driver element, which is fed from a microstrip line through a two-parallel strip 
transmission line. The arms of the dipole are located at the end of this transmission 
line, placed on either face of the substrate in a mirror image configuration, which 
creates 180° phase difference between the arms, providing the correct feed to the 
antenna. The length of the printed dipole, that is, the driver length LDRI, which is 
basically half wavelength, is chosen through numerical simulation. It is found numeri-
cally to be about 0.4λo, indicating that the substrate effective permittivity is about 
1.56. The width of the dipole arm, WDRI, is chosen approximately to be one-tenth 
of a wavelength based on an iteration process to achieve good radiation patterns

and impedance bandwidth. The metallization on the bottom plane is a truncated 
ground plane and behaves like a director element for the antenna.
The dipole-reflector is placed parasitically on the upper face of the substrate 
opposite to the ground plane. The main function of the dipole-reflector is to direct 
the radiation backward, toward the microstrip feed line. Its length LREF is set slightly 
larger than the driver length, LDRI, similar to Yagi antennas. Its width WREF is the 
same as that of the dipole arm, about one-tenth of the wavelength. The separation 
between the driver and dipole-reflector is set approximately one-twentieth of the 
wavelength. This selection is based on the coupling between the dipole-reflector 
and driver element. The feeding structure consists of a microstrip line on one side 
of the substrate and truncated ground plane on the other side, both connecting to 
two arms of a parallel strip transmission line L1 that feeds the dipole, as shown in 
Figure 3.40. The length of the transmission line affects the radiation patterns and 
should be carefully selected, but must be small, as it increases the cross polarization.

constant of εr = 2.5, a loss tangent of tan(δ) = 0.0022, and an area of 60 × 60 mm2.
Figure 3.41(a) shows the simulated and measured S11 of the antenna. The simu-
lated −10 dB S11 bandwidth is from 2.78–3.28 GHz (16.5%), and the corresponding 
measured one is from 2.81–3.28 GHz, (15.4%). The surface currents are shown in 
Figure 3.41(b), and the simulated radiation patterns at the center frequency of 3 
GHz are shown in Figure 3.41(c). As expected, the H-plane radiation pattern has a 
wider beamwidth than the E-plane one. In addition, Figure 3.41(c) shows that the 
main beam is not fully symmetric about the axis, although the antenna geometry is. 
This implies that the microstrip feed line also radiates. It should be mentioned that 
the effect of the supporting rod, which was a semiflexible cable with an SMA con-
nector, was also studied. It had a negligible effect on the feed patterns.

An advantage of this antenna is in its printed configuration that allows simple 
modifications to improve its impedance bandwidth. The preceding antenna had an

impedance bandwidth of 16.5%. The feed line geometry was modified as shown 
in Figure 3.42(a) to improve its impedance bandwidth. The new S11 and its Smith 
Chart plot are shown in Figure 3.42(b) and (c). The impedance bandwidth has now 
increased to 29%, from 2.85–3.82 GHz. The radiating parts of the antenna have 
remained the same as in Figure 3.41.
3.5.2.2	 Improving Pattern Symmetry
The original antenna was symmetric about the x-z plane but had asymmetric E-plane 
radiation patterns, which was caused by the feed line radiation. To improve the 
E-plane pattern symmetry for co-polarization, the lengths of the dipole arms were 
made unequal, but keeping the total dipole length the same. Using this technique, 
a good symmetry was found for co-polarization patterns. Figure 3.43(a) shows the 
left and right dipole arms, with unequal lengths, connected through the microstrip 
line. The width of the dipole arms is the same as the original case. With the change 
of the dipole arms lengths, the pattern symmetry about the x-z plane is improved 
and the back lobe level is reduced, as shown in Figure 3.43(b).
3.5.2.3	 Miniaturizing Printed Dipole Feed
The printed dipole antenna of Figure 3.40(d) is miniaturized by introducing a pair 
of slits in the dipole arms, as shown in Figure 3.44(a) [47]. The width and length 
of the slits are 1 mm and 8 mm, respectively. The position of the slits in the dipole 
arms is important because it changes the characteristics of the input impedance 
and also the radiation patterns of the antenna. When they are located 4 mm and

9 mm from the feed line, the impedance bandwidth remains high and about 29%. 
The slits in the dipole arms change the current distribution on the surface and force 
the current to follow a meander route. Thus, the electrical length of the antenna 
is increased while its physical length is decreased. With two slits the dipole and its 
reflector lengths become 26 mm and 36 mm, respectively, which is a 20% reduction 
in the dipole feed size. For further miniaturization, the shape of the dipole arms is 
changed to H-shape so that current distribution is increased further. More slits can 
be introduced to further miniaturize; however, it degrades the radiation efficiency 
of the feed. To further improve the E-plane pattern symmetry, the dipole-reflector 
was also shaped by extending the end edges toward the dipole arms, as depicted in 
Figure 3.44(a). The simulated feed patterns of the proposed antenna at 3 GHz are 
illustrated in Figure 3.44(b).

3.5.2.4	 Printed Dipole Pattern Equalization
The preceding dipole feeds did not address the asymmetric beamwidths of the dipole. 
In using the feed with reflectors, having circular aperture shapes, it is desirable to 
have symmetric radiation patterns, with equal beamwidths in its principal planes. 
This can be achieved using different approaches. Here, it is accomplished by load-
ing the dipole arms by vertical stubs, which is a variation of the previous slotted 
dipole case. The selected geometry and its performance are shown in Figure 3.45, 
which resembles a corrugated dipole [48]. Its parameters are optimized to equal-
ize the principal plane beamwidths while keeping the impedance bandwidth above 
24%. The stub length is the most important parameter, and its influence on the 
beamwidth and other feed parameters is shown in Table 3.4. The stub length of 12 
mm provides symmetric radiation patterns, with nearly equal −10 dB beamwidths. 
The lengths and widths of the dipole and its reflector are the same as the previous 
case of the miniaturized feed. The cross polarization is high, but as in previous cases, 
it is primarily due to the radiation from the transmission line. As Figure 3.45(d) 
shows, the E- and H-plane radiation patterns are almost identical. Table 3.5 shows 
Figure 3.45  The geometry and simulated parameters of the corrugated dipole feed, designed

the performance of this feed within a 0.2 GHz bandwidth, centered at 3 GHz. The 
simulated efficiencies are almost constant.
3.5.3	
Printed Dipole Performance with a Reflector
The performance of the above feeds on a parabolic reflector antenna was investigated 
following established procedures. The reflector has a diameter of 45 cm with a focal 
length of 11.25 cm. The feed is connected to a semirigid coaxial cable RG 402 and 
is mounted centrally on the reflector, using a foam support. The coaxial cable had 
an insertion loss of 0.2 dB at 3 GHz. The measured principal plane radiation pat-
terns of the reflector with the corrugated printed dipole feed are shown in Figure 
3.46(a). At 3 GHz, the measured reflector gain is 21.2 dBi, which includes the feed 
cable loss. This corresponds to an overall gain factor of 66%, slightly lower than the 
simulated value of 70%. Considering the simplicity of the feed, the measured gain 
and its efficiency are respectable. Figure 3.46(b) also shows the measured S11 of the 
feed when mounted on the reflector. Its −10 dB bandwidth is about 29%, which is 
slightly higher than its bandwidth of 24% without the reflector.
The measured radiation patterns show excellent symmetry of the main beam, 
which is an indication of the symmetric feed radiation patterns. The sidelobe levels 
are below −20 dB in both principal planes and slightly lower in the E-plane. Their 
level can be adjusted, to some degree, by adjusting the feed distance from the reflec-
tor. This is due to the fact that in such a small reflector there is a strong interaction 
between the feed and reflector. This allows the control of both S11 and sidelobe level 
by the feed distance from the reflector. Such an adjustment also affects the reflector 
gain, and in practice, a compromise has to be made.

Asymmetric Feeds
The primary feeds discussed in the preceding sections were designed for symmetrically 
cut parabolic reflector antennas. In most applications, the symmetrical geometry of 
the reflecting surface naturally enforces the use of feeds with symmetric radiation pat-
terns. However, in asymmetrical focusing surfaces, such as offset parabolic reflectors, 
this is not necessarily the case. The use of such structures is desirable in most modern 
applications due to their distinct features over the parent parabolas. For instance, 
with a proper offset geometry, the blockage due to the feeds and supporting struts 
will be cancelled or reduced, whereas in symmetric parabolas this shadowing effect 
becomes troublesome for large aperture feeds and their support structure, result-
ing in higher sidelobes and cross polarizations. In addition, offset reflectors provide 
excellent isolation between the feed and the reflector and have reasonable structure 
rigidity, even with large F/D ratios [1, 6, 49]. Despite their profound advantages 
over symmetrical parabolas, the offset reflectors generate high cross polarization 
in the plane of asymmetry when illuminated by conventional symmetric feeds. To 
alleviate the stated problem, the concept of matched primary feeds may be used. 
In Rudge and Adatia [50], it was shown that the over-mode waveguides are good 
candidates to conjugately match the focal plane electric fields in the offset reflectors. 
The distinguishing characteristic of such matched feeds is their asymmetrical radia-
tion patterns. This will, in turn, result in high cross polarization component in the 
feed radiation patterns, which will eliminate the inherent cross polarization of the 
offset geometry. Therefore, the secondary patterns will have low cross polarizations.
In this section, an example of such asymmetric feeds is provided, which can 
be used in low cross-talk offset reflector antennas. More detail on the concept and 
these asymmetric feeds are found in Chapter 8. The geometry of proposed asym-
metric feed [51] is shown in Figure 3.47. It consists of only two waveguide sections. 
It generates both TE11 and TE21 modes with a −90° phase difference between them, 
with the proper selection of the larger waveguide. The excitation sources of the TE21 
mode are two radial blocks/screws, which can be placed at any arbitrary axial posi-
tion. In the present design, they are placed on the feed aperture, to be far from the

focal length are 45 mm, and 11.25 cm. The feed is the corrugated printed dipole of Figure 3.45(a).

waveguide discontinuity, to cause maximum attenuation of the higher order modes 
at the junction. In this manner, the input waveguide port is not influenced by their 
detrimental effects, and the feed can be designed easily to be broadband. The inner 
and outer radii are 13.0 and 17.3 mm, respectively. The length of the larger wave-
guide is 24 mm, and the total antenna length and waveguide wall thickness are 77.5 
and 2 mm, respectively. This structure can now operate as a dual-mode feed with 
adjustable mode content ratios using the tuning screws.
The simulated and measured co-polar and cross-polar far-field radiation pat-
terns of the dual-mode asymmetric feed are plotted in Figure 3.48 at the frequen-
cies of 8.0 and 9.0 GHz, when the length of the blocks is 4 mm. The measurement 
and simulated results agree well at both frequencies. It is evident that the primary

co-polar patterns are not symmetric at the principal planes, as the peaks of the main 
beams are not coincident. Moreover, the cross polarization component is quite high, 
which is necessary in order to reduce the unwanted cross polarization of offset reflec-
tor antennas. To show this, the secondary radiation patterns of an elliptical offset 
reflector illuminated by the proposed feed are shown in Figure 3.49 [52] at both  
ϕ = 90° and 45° planes at 8.3 GHz. The reflector has an F/D of 0.6. The major and 
minor axes of the projected ellipse are 91 and 68 cm, respectively. As observed, the 
cross polarization level is below −35 dB at both asymmetry and diagonal planes.

Feed Pattern Shaping by Superstrate Loading
The feeds discussed so far dealt with small antennas, having dimensions in order 
of one wavelength or less. With such a small dimension, it is difficult to cause 
excessive pattern shaping to continue improving the reflector secondary patterns. 
However, in spite of these difficulties, excellent feeds suitable for both shallow and 
deep reflectors were presented. One area that these small feeds suffer is the pattern 
roll-off beyond the reflector edge, which causes the spill-over power. For additional 
pattern shaping or reduction of the spill-over power, consider enlarged feed dimen-
sions, discussed in upcoming chapters, or load the feed with reflectors or lenses. All 
these solutions increase the feed cross section and consequently the reflector aper-
ture blockage. Thus, they may only be considered with large reflector antennas or 
offset configurations. Since the chapter is dedicated to small feeds, covering such 
large aperture feeds is out of the scope of this chapter. Instead, a few examples of 
such feeds, especially those with superstrate and engineered structures, are briefly 
introduced for the interested readers.

reflector antenna fed by simulated feed shown in Figure 3.47 at both ϕ = 90° and 45° planes at

Feed Pattern Shaping by Superstrate Loading
93
Considerable work has been done recently on planar cavity type antennas 
to improve their gain or shape their radiation patterns [53–55]. The excitation 
can be due to either waveguide or planar microstrip type feeds, as discussed ear-
lier. The beam shaping, or gain enhancement, is done normally by either stacking 
dielectric sheets in the form of superstrate [53] or using a single partially reflective 
surface in the forms of artificial surfaces and frequency selective superstrates [54–
55]. For parabolic reflector antennas, the ideal aperture illumination is given by a 
f(θ) = (secθ)2, which requires a shallow axial null on the feed radiation patterns, simi-
lar to those in Figures 3.21, 3.22, and 3.24. Using cavity antennas, radiation patterns 
with axial nulls have been generated to design feeds for offset reflector antennas. A 
large cavity antenna loaded with a planar lens in the form of an electromagnetic bad 
gap (EBG) superstrate was also reported [56]. The antenna was fed by a standard 
WR90 X-band waveguide. Two commercially available dielectric slabs with εr = 2.2 
were used as superstrate layers, separated from one another and from the ground 
plane by foam slabs. The superstrate layer size was 16λo × 16λo, where λo is the free 
space wavelength at the frequency of 10.67 GHz [56]. The pattern roll-off of such 
a large antenna, beyond the peak around 36°, is about 1 dB/degree, which is four 
times higher than that of small feeds in Figures 3.21, 3.22, and 3.24. The price paid 
for this rapid roll-off is the increased size of the feed, which is impractical with small 
reflectors but may be accommodated in large or offset reflectors.

Smooth Wall Multimode Horns for  
High Aperture Efficiency—Theory, 
Design, and Applications

Introduction
The horn radiators are commonly used in the space and ground-based antenna 
systems for their inherent advantages of manufacturing simplicity and low RF loss 
even at millimeter and submillimeter frequency ranges [1–5]. In a direct radiating 
array smooth wall horn elements are preferable due to lower weights as compared 
with corrugated and dielectric loaded horn elements. In addition, with respect to a 
desired array-gain, a smooth wall horn array utilizes lower aperture area compared 
to other types of horn arrays. This is primarily due to the thin walls that allow the 
elements to be closely spaced. Horn radiators are also useful as feeds for reflector 
antennas generating shaped-beam or multiple pencil beams [6]. As a phased array 
element, it is desirable that a horn has high aperture efficiency in order to achieve a 
high array-gain. The array-gain could also be improved by increasing the aperture 
size of the elements; but for many applications that may not be a viable option due 
to the grating lobe problems. Furthermore, for a desired array-gain the high element-
aperture-efficiency reduces the number of elements. For a scanned beam array, a 
small number of elements implies a small number of array modules. Consequently, 
the beam forming network design becomes less complex, reducing the implementa-
tion cost of the array antenna.
In a multiple-beam reflector antenna, the physical aperture size of a feed horn is 
restricted by the presence of the neighboring horns. In that situation, high aperture 
efficiency of the feed horns is desirable to maintain the necessary edge-taper of the 
reflector. The reflector edge-taper is dictated by the edge of the coverage gain of the 
spot beams and the beam-to-beam isolation. A Potter horn [7], typically designed for 
low cross-polarization level, has low aperture efficiency. Intrinsic to the low aperture 
efficiency, such a horn may not satisfy the edge-taper requirement due to small pat-
tern roll-off. Linearly flared conical horns have somewhat larger aperture efficiency 
compared to a Potter horn but suffer from bad cross-polarization performance [2].

Smooth Wall Multimode Horns for High Aperture Efficiency—Theory, Design, and Applications 
The latter is due to the difference in the E- and H-plane patterns, which plays an 
important role in deciding the cross-polarization level of a circular aperture.
Implementing identical aperture distributions along the E- and H-planes can mini-
mize the cross-polarization of a circular horn. The Potter type of design essentially 
utilizes this concept by adding the TM11 mode with the fundamental TE11 mode in 
the right amplitude and phase [7]. However, such a modal combination results in a 
highly tapered aperture distribution in both planes, lowering the aperture efficiency 
of the horn. For achieving high aperture efficiency, a rectangular horn with sym-
metrical steps in E-plane walls is employed [8]. However, this design is limited to 
single linear polarization radiation only. A multimode rectangular horn with ellip-
tical beam is reported in [9]. This horn is the rectangular equivalent of the “Potter 
horn”; therefore it also has low aperture efficiency. Tsandoulas and Fitzgerald [10] 
and Baldwin and McInnes [11], used dielectric loading to enhance aperture efficiency 
of a rectangular horn. Such horns are heavy, have fabrication complexity, and may 
have surface charge accumulation on the dielectric surface leading to electrostatic 
discharge. In [12] the efficiency of a square or rectangular horn is increased by 
dividing the entire radiating aperture into a number of small apertures by inserting 
a cross-shaped taper septum. Gain enhancement was also demonstrated by intro-
ducing a symmetrical metal plate inside a conical horn [13]. Hard wall horns using 
photonic-band-gap structure walls and strip-loaded walls were proposed for gain 
enhancement purpose [14–18].
In this chapter, we present a simple step-horn that has almost uniform field dis-
tributions along the E- and H-planes of the aperture [19]. As a result, the aperture 
efficiency becomes very high, about 90%, which is about 30% more than that of 
a Potter horn of comparable aperture size. In addition, because of identical distri-
butions along the E- and H-planes, the E- and H-plane patterns are very close to 
each other, resulting in a low cross-polar level in the main lobe region. It is found 
that for obtaining such high aperture efficiency, only the TEz types of modes should 
exist on the horn aperture with proper amplitudes and phases [20, 21], where z is 
the propagation direction. For a given aperture shape, the relative amplitude and 
phase distributions for various TEz modes are independent of the aperture size. The 
amplitudes and the phases of the desired modes are realized using multiple step 
discontinuities and flared sections with various slopes [21]. A typical horn has four 
linearly flared sections and two steps as shown in Figure 4.1. These steps not only 
generate the desired TEz modes but also generate the undesired TMz modes. The 
distances between the steps are critical in order to suppress the undesired TMz modes 
by “out-of-phase” cancellation method. This chapter presents operation principle, 
detailed analysis, and design guidelines of such horn structures.
The remaining part of the chapter is organized in the following way. In Sec-
tion 4.2 we discuss the general principle of high aperture efficiency radiation. In 
Section 4.3 we present the characteristics of a circular high-efficiency horn, and in 
Section 4.4 we discuss the square aperture version. Section 4.5 presents the perfor-
mance of a flared high-efficiency horn without the steps. In Section 4.6 we discuss 
the thin wall high-efficiency horns proposed by others. Potential applications and 
advantages of these horns are presented in Section 4.7 and concluding remarks are 
presented in Section 4.8.

Theory for High Aperture Efficiency
Consider a horn radiator with arbitrary-shaped aperture as shown in Figure 4.2. The 
aperture field can be described as a superposition of the TEz and TMz orthogonal 
modes, where the z-axis is perpendicular to the aperture plane. Each mode satis-
fies the conductive boundary condition at horn’s wall; consequently, the modes are 
mutually orthogonal [22]. The transverse components of the horn-aperture electric 
field can be expressed as:

The transverse magnetic field on the horn aperture can also be expressed in

definition of the antenna gain (assuming that the gain and directivity are identical), 
we can express (4.4a) as

power, the denominator of (4.4b) is a constant.2 Thus, the aperture efficiency will 
have its maximum value at a desired far-field point (θ,ϕ), if P(θ,ϕ) is maximized. 
Using triangle inequality and Schwartz’s inequality [24], it can be shown that the 
right-hand side of (4.5) will exhibit its upper bound (maximum) if M

identically. We thus prove that for obtaining the maximum aperture efficiency the 
TMz mode should not exist on the horn aperture.
A similar development for the TEz modal voltages gives a contour integral in the 
z-component of the electric vector potential [23], instead of Az. The electric vector 
potential does not vanish everywhere on the horn’s walls; therefore the TEz modal 
voltages are not identically zero.
4.3	
Circular Aperture
We have shown that for the maximum aperture efficiency only the TEz types of modes 
should exist on the horn’s aperture. The amplitudes of the TEz modes must be in 
appropriate proportions in order to produce a uniform and unidirectional aperture 
field. We will consider a circular aperture and determine the modal amplitudes. For 
a circular horn, the TEz modal vector can be represented as [26],

The phases of the propagating modes are identical.3 For evanescent modes, the 
phase angles are ±90°; the positive or negative sign depends on the sign used for 
the normalization factor in (4.11). In practice, only the propagating modes arrive 
at the aperture plane, so the radiated fields are contributed by propagating modes 
only.4 Therefore an ideal aperture field distribution can never be realized in practice. 
In the following section we discuss the method used to realize the necessary modal 
distribution.
4.3.1	
Realization of the Modes
The desired modes with appropriate amplitudes and phases can be realized with 
multiple steps and flared sections in a smooth wall horn as shown in Figure 4.3(a) 
and (b). The location of the steps should be such that after the generation, the desired 
modes can propagate toward the aperture. For example, if the horn aperture size 
is such that it can support three TEz modes, then two steps on the horn’s wall may 
be used. The first step nearest to the input section should create the TE21 mode and 
the second step should create the TE31 mode. Accordingly, the horn dimension after 
the first step should be above the cut-off dimension of the TE21 mode. Similarly, the 
dimension after the second step should be above the cut-off dimension of the TE31 
mode. Linearly (or profile) flared section between the discontinuities may be used. 
The relative amplitudes of the desired higher order modes determine the step heights, 
slopes, and the section lengths. It should be mentioned that the step discontinuities 
also produce the undesired TMz modes. The distance between the step discontinuities 
and the flared angles between the steps can be adjusted to minimize the amplitudes 
of the undesired TMz modes. For instance, the TM11 mode generated at the first 
3It should be mentioned that the phase of a mode is determined with respect to the modal vector defined 
in (4.10). The phase of the modal voltages will differ if a different definition is used.
4Evanescent modes may be produced on the aperture due to the discontinuity of guided modes at the 
aperture-air interface, but those evanescent modes generally have insignificant contributions to the far 
field.

104
Smooth Wall Multimode Horns for High Aperture Efficiency—Theory, Design, and Applications 
step is cancelled by the “out of phase” TM11 mode generated at the second step. The 
distance between the two steps is critical for this effect.
Both inward and outward steps may be used as shown in Figure 4.3(a) and (b). 
For an outward step, the incident TE11 mode produces TM11 mode in phase. However, 
for an inward step, the incident TE11 mode produces the TM11 mode about 180° out 
of phase. The distance between the two steps should be such that the TM11 mode 
produced at the first step is cancelled by the second step. Therefore, if both steps are 
in outward directions as in Figure 4.2(a), the following condition should be satisfied:

where λ11 represents the average guide wavelength in the section between the two 
steps. It should be mentioned that the left-hand side could be any odd multiple of 
one-half, but we consider the smallest possible number to minimize the length of 
the horn. Equation (4.17) is not rigorous because the horn flare modifies the rela-
tive amplitude and phase of the mode. Also, the multiple reflections between the 
two discontinuities modify the relative phase and amplitude. Furthermore, the flare 
at the input section creates some amount of the TM11 mode, which differs in phase 
from the incident TE11 mode. In practice, the actual value of L2 + L3 is smaller than 
Figure 4.3  Two-step high-efficiency horn geometry. (a) with two outward steps. (b) with inward 
and outward steps.

that obtained using (4.17). Nevertheless, (4.17) gives an idea about the approximate 
distance between the steps, but in a real design this distance must be obtained by 
numerical optimization. The left-hand side would be different if one of the steps is 
in the inward direction as depicted in Figure 4.3(b).
4.3.2	
Circular Horn Design
To illustrate the design procedure, we consider a horn of 4λ aperture diameter, where 
λ represents the wavelength at the center frequency of the band of interest. The input 
diameter of the horn is 0.72λ. The first step is placed at a location where the diam-
eter is about 1.7λ (the cut-off dimension for the TE21 mode). Similarly for the TE31 
mode, the second step is at 2.7λ diameter location. A third step near 3.7λ diameter 
location could have been placed to produce the TE41 mode, but that would require 
an extra horn-length for phase adjustment on the aperture (the aperture being near 
cut-off for the TE41 mode, the guide wavelength becomes large, resulting in a long, 
flared section to achieve a desired phase for that mode). The actual dimensions are 
obtained by optimizing the structure to achieve high efficiency and good cross-
polarization. A gradient search-based algorithm is employed toward that end. The 
axial length of the horn is obtained as 8.25λ. For the horn analysis, software based 
on multimode moment method [27] is used. For the two-step horn, the normalized 
modal voltages at the aperture are shown in Table 4.1.
From the numerical data we notice that the achieved modal voltage for the TE21 
mode is fairly close to the desired amount. For the higher order modes, however, the 
deviation increases primarily due to the limited number of adjustable parameters 
(degrees of freedom). For the same reason, the TMz modes are not completely sup-
pressed as observed in Table 4.1.
It is instructive to examine the aperture field distribution of the horn with respect 
to the achieved modal voltage distribution. Figure 4.4 shows the magnitude of the 
transverse electric field along the E-, H-, and diagonal-planes. The field is fairly uni-
form in the major portion of the aperture as desired. On the E-plane, the aperture 
field is nonzero near the boundary wall. This is not so for the H-plane because of 
the boundary condition of the modal fields. As a result, the field distributions are 
somewhat different on the two orthogonal planes, particularly near the boundary 
wall. This difference improves with the increasing number of modes. However, for 
a finite aperture size the modes beyond certain order are evanescent; consequently 
such evanescent modes cannot be realized on the aperture.

Figure 4.5 shows the electric field lines on the aperture plane. Since the realized 
phase angles are non-zero for the higher order modes (see Table 4.1), the field lines 
should not be time invariant. In the present plot we ignore the phase difference 
between the two orthogonal polarizations. The field lines are fairly unidirectional 
across the aperture, indicating low cross-polarization level in the far-field pattern. 
The small deflection from being unidirectional is partly due to the small number of 
propagating modes and partly due to the nonideal modal amplitudes.

Figure 4.6 shows the 3-D linear co-polarization pattern of the 4λ-horn. The real-
ized gain is 21.6 dBi, which corresponds to 91.4% aperture efficiency. Such aperture 
efficiency is significantly higher than that of a Potter horn of identical aperture size 
(the Potter horn efficiency is estimated as about 68%). The pattern appears to be 
rotationally symmetrical. The sidelobe level is about 19 dB below the beam peak, 
which is expected from a uniformly illuminated circular aperture (ideally the sidelobe 
should be 17.6 dB). Figure 4.7 shows the co- and cross-polarization pattern-cuts 
at 45° plane (diagonal plane). The cross-polarization level is below −34 dB within

the main lobe of the co-polar beam. This cross-polar level is much better than that 
of a conical horn and is very comparable with that of a Potter horn of the same 
aperture size.
To evaluate the bandwidth performance of two-step high-efficiency horns, we 
designed three horns of aperture diameters 3λ, 4λ, and 5λ, respectively. The design 
objective was to obtain a good cross-polarization and return loss performance while 
maintaining aperture efficiency above 85%. Figure 4.8 shows the variation of the 
aperture efficiency with normalized frequency. For the 3λ aperture (diameter), 15% 
bandwidth is achievable with respect to a minimum aperture-efficiency of 90%. The 
bandwidth increases to about 20% with respect to a minimum aperture efficiency 
of 85%. The peak efficiency and the bandwidth both decrease with the aperture 
size. For 5λ-aperture the bandwidth reduces to 5% with respect to 85% aperture 
efficiency. It is worth mentioning that the bandwidth increases significantly if the 
return loss and cross-polarization constraints are relaxed or withdrawn from the 
objective function.
Figure 4.9 shows the variations of input return loss and cross-polarization5 with 
the normalized frequency. The −30 dB cross-polarization bandwidth is larger for 
smaller aperture. The input match is better than −25 dB within the band.
Figure 4.10 compares the performances of conical, Potter, and high-efficiency 
circular horns of similar aperture sizes and axial lengths. Expectedly, the high-
efficiency horns have significantly larger aperture efficiency compared to the other 
horns. The aperture efficiency of the high-efficiency horn varies from 95–90% when 
the diameter increases from 3–5λ. The aperture efficiencies vary from 71–64% and 
81–66% in the case of Potter and conical horns, respectively. The cross-polarization 
level of the high-efficiency horn is comparable with that of the Potter horn and much 
better than that of a conical horn.
5Unless otherwise mentioned, the cross-polarization of a horn is referred to as the worst-case cross-
polarization level within the −10 dB co-polarization taper.

It is possible to design two-step high-efficiency horns of various aperture diam-
eters only by adjusting the axial length of the aperture section while keeping the 
first three sections unchanged. This is particularly true for the aperture efficiency 
performance. With reference to Figure 4.11, the horn-dimensions are given in Table 
4.2 in terms of free-space wavelength, λ, at the center frequency of the band. The 
input waveguide diameter is assumed as 0.73λ. For other input waveguide diameter, 
the dimensions change slightly, particularly the input section length L1.
The preceding dimensions yield an aperture efficiency ranging from 86–90% if 
the aperture diameter Da lies between 3λ and 5λ. The efficiency can be improved 
further with fine-tuning the dimensions. The cross-polarization and return loss can 
also be improved. For that matter, the dimensions can be used as a starting solution 
in an optimization routine. It should be mentioned that several other designs are

also possible. Note that the axial length for the design in Table 4.2 is about twice 
the aperture diameter.
4.3.3	
Three-Step Horn
For aperture diameter less than 4.5λ, the two-step design provides good aperture effi-
ciency with reasonable cross-polarization performance. The performance deteriorates 
if the aperture size increases beyond 4.5λ. It is found that an additional step improves 
the performance significantly. A three-step horn with aperture dimension of 5λ is 
designed to achieve about 88% aperture efficiency with −30 dB cross-polarization 
level. Figure 4.12 shows efficiency, return loss, and the worst-case cross-polarization

level versus normalized frequency. The cross-polarization level is better than −30 dB 
within 10% bandwidth. As noted, the aperture efficiency is better than 86% within 
the band, and the return loss is better than 25 dB.
The multistep horn design is extended for dual band operation. A dual band 
horn is successfully designed to operate at 11.7–12.2 GHz and 14.0–14.5 GHz 
bands [28]. Over 85% aperture efficiency is achieved for both bands. The return 
loss was better than 25 dB in both bands. The cross-polarization levels are −32 and 
−27 dB, respectively, for the bands. The aperture diameter was 3.8 inches, and the 
horn length was about 7.5 inches.
4.4	
Square High-Efficiency Horn
A similar design procedure can be invoked for square high-efficiency horns. It is 
found that in a square (also in rectangular) aperture, the modal voltages should be 
in the following ratio.

The phase of the modes should be identical for the propagating modes. The 
modal voltage corresponds to the modal vector as defined in Marcuvitz [26]. As 
for the circular geometry, the TMz modes should not exist on the horn’s aperture. 
Also, the TEm0 even order modes (i.e., with m = 2, 4, 6,…) should not exist on the 
aperture. For the TE10 incident mode at the horn’s input, the undesired TEz modes 
are not produced unless the horn has nonsymmetrical discontinuities.
For a linearly polarized (LP) radiated field the desired TEz modes can be produced 
with steps on the H-plane of the horn [8, 29]. Interestingly, symmetrical H-plane 
steps do not produce the TMz modes, which is a desirable feature in a high-efficiency 
rectangular horn. However, for dual LP radiation or for circular polarization (CP) 
radiation, the incident modes being TE10 and TE01, steps in both E- and H-planes 
are required to produce necessary modes for both polarizations. As in the case of a 
circular horn, the steps must be placed where the cross sections allow propagation of 
the intended higher order modes. For instance, to produce the TE30 and TE03 modes 
effectively in a square horn, the step must be placed near the waveguide region that 
has 1.5λ × 1.5λ cross-sectional area. However, this step will also produce the unde-
sired TE12, TE21, TM12, and TM21 modes that have lower cut-off frequency than the 
TE30 and TE03 modes. The second step helps cancel out these undesired modes by 
generating these modes again with 180º out of phase. Another purpose of the second 
step is generating the desired TE50 and TE05 modes. The optimum dimensions are 
given in Table 4.3 that can be used to design a two-step high-efficiency square horn 
as depicted in Figure 4.13 for aperture dimensions ranging from 3–4.5λ.
The design yields an aperture efficiency varying from 85–90% when a varies 
from 4.5–3λ. The aperture efficiency and other characteristics can be improved by 
fine-tuning these dimensions using an optimizer routine.
Figure 4.14 shows the radiation patterns of a two-step square high-efficiency 
horn with aperture size of 3.54λ. The aperture efficiency was 90.8%. Notice that the 

112
Smooth Wall Multimode Horns for High Aperture Efficiency—Theory, Design, and Applications 
sidelobes in the E- and H-planes are about 14 dB below the main lobe peak, which 
corresponds to a uniform aperture distribution of a square aperture. The worst-
case cross-polarization level is 25 dB below the co-polarization peak. It is generally 
observed that the circular high-efficiency horns have better cross-polar performance 
than that of a high-efficiency square horn. This may not be a problem in reality, 
because high-efficiency square horns are generally used as array elements, and the 
cross-polarization level within the scanning range (usually 3–5 dB below the co-
polarization peak) is better than –30 dB, which is acceptable in most applications.
To examine the characteristics of high-efficiency square horns we plot the effi-
ciency and return loss of two optimized horns in Figure 4.15. The efficiency for a

3λ square aperture is about 90% within 10% bandwidth. As in the case of circular 
high-efficiency horns, the bandwidth decreases with the increase in aperture size. The 
return loss is better than 25 dB over the band. For larger aperture dimensions (over 
4.5λ) more than two steps may be needed to achieve maximum aperture efficiency 
and good return loss performance.
4.5	
Multiflared High-Efficiency Horns
The steps of a “step-and-flared” structure in Figure 4.2 are removed and then reopti-
mized to examine the aperture efficiency performance of the modified structure. It is 
found that a good efficiency performance can be achieved from such a “multiflared” 
structure [30]. The general profile of the modified horn remains very similar to that 
of a step-and-flared horn (see Figure 4.16). The slopes become different, however, in 
order to compensate the effects of the steps. With respect to the aperture efficiency, 
the performance of a step-horn and a flared-horn are very much comparable. Figure 
4.17 shows the aperture efficiency comparison of 4λ-circular horns. The parameters 
for optimization are section lengths, slopes, and step sizes, and the goal is to achieve 
a minimum of 88% aperture efficiency within 15% bandwidth. Both horns gener-
ally satisfy the requirements. The step-and-flared horn, however, shows somewhat 
larger bandwidth than the multiflared horn primarily because the steps provide 
additional degrees of freedom to the optimization process. It is generally observed 
that for moderate aperture efficiency requirements in wide band, the step sizes of 
a step-horn become small. However, this may not be the case if high aperture effi-
ciency in a smaller band is desired. Figure 4.18 shows the performances of 4λ horns 
with and without steps. In this case, the requirement is to achieve maximum pos-
sible aperture efficiency within 5% bandwidth. The horn with steps performs better 
than the horn without steps. The step sizes are substantial (about 0.1λ) in this case. 
For a given aperture size, a step-and-flared horn has smaller axial length than that 
of a multiflared horn. With respect to the 4λ horns associated with Figure 4.18, the 
step-horn is about 0.5λ shorter than the flared-horn.

Other High-Efficiency Horn Structures
Several high-efficiency thin-wall horn structures are proposed in the literature. Bird 
and Granet [31] present “spline-profile” rectangular horn designs for high-aperture 
efficiency. The size and the performance of the horns are comparable with that of 
a rectangular step-and-flared horn considered in Section 4.4. Chan and Rao [32] 
present multiflared (five-flared sections) circular horn designs for single and dual 
band operations. For a single band horn, the reported performance is very similar to 
that of a four-flared horn, presented before. The axial length of the dual band design 
[32] is over three times the aperture diameter, which is significantly longer than the 
dual band design presented [28], however. Ruggerini [33] presents very compact 
designs with axial lengths about 1.2 times of the aperture diameter. Reduction of 
axial length was accomplished with wave-shaped horn walls. Such compact horns 
have narrower bandwidth than that of step-and-flared horns.

Applications
4.7.1	
In Direct Radiating Arrays
Horn elements are very suitable for direct radiating arrays [5] for small scan angles. 
High-efficiency horn elements would be very attractive because they yield enhanced 
array gain due to their high-aperture efficiency. For a given element size and for a 
desired array gain, the high-efficiency horns significantly reduce the number of ele-
ments in the array. For a given element size, there is a maximum limit for the scan 
angle where the high-efficiency horn is advantageous over other horns of identical 
aperture size. To illustrate this, consider an array of square horn elements where the 
element aperture size is 3λ × 3λ. The limiting scan angle can be estimated by compar-
ing the gain pattern of a high-efficiency horn with that of a pyramidal horn of the 
same size, because the scan gain is directly proportional to the element gain [5] if the 
mutual coupling is ignored. Figure 4.19 shows the gain pattern of such horns of the 
Figure 4.19  Gain patterns of a square high-efficiency step horn and a square pyramidal horn of 
identical length and aperture size. Aperture size = 3λ, ––– high-efficiency step horn, ---- pyramidal 
horn. (©2004 IEEE [21].)

same aperture dimensions of 3λ × 3λ. The crossover point is at θ = 15°. Therefore, 
if the scanning range is ±15°, an array with a high-efficiency horn will have higher 
gain than that with a pyramidal horn for all scanned beams. However, if the array 
scans beyond ±15º, pyramidal horns will yield a higher gain. Such a situation gen-
erally does not arise in practice, because for a given element size, the grating lobe 
positions limit the maximum scan angle. In the present case, for instance, the scan 
angle should not exceed 9.6° (for a rectangular lattice) in order to keep the grating 
lobes outside the scanning region. Within 9.6° scan angle, the high-efficiency horn 
array shows about 0.8 dB more gain than a pyramidal horn array of equal number 
of elements. To compensate the gain difference, either 20% more pyramidal horn 
elements or bigger horn-apertures are required. This increases cost and complexity 
of the array.
For spot beams, the high-efficiency horn array shows better edge-of-coverage 
gain than the pyramidal horns. For a desired array gain, the aperture area of the 
array made with pyramidal horns will be bigger than the array made with high-
efficiency square horns. As a result, the beam of the pyramidal horn array becomes 
sharper than that of the high-efficiency horn array. This causes lower edge of the 
coverage gain for the pyramidal horn array. To illustrate this effect, we plot the 
radiation patterns of two arrays of identical gain at the beam peak (40.2 dBi). The 
high-efficiency square horn array is a 10 × 10 element-array with an element size 
of 3λ. The pyramidal horn array is an 11 × 11 element-array with an element size 
of 3λ. The gain patterns are plotted in Figure 4.20. The high-efficiency horn array 
has a bigger beam size (defined by the –3 dB relative gain contour) than that of the 
pyramidal horn array. Equivalently, for a given coverage area (1.5° beam diameter, 
for example) the high-efficiency horn array shows 0.6 dB more edge of the coverage 
gain than that of the pyramidal horn array.
It should be pointed out that the above array analysis is conducted ignoring 
mutual coupling effects. In order to examine the mutual coupling effects, we com-
puted the horn aperture efficiency in an infinite array environment using a Floquet 
Figure 4.20  Gain of the spot beams produced by two arrays of square high-efficiency step horns 
and square pyramidal horns. Peak gain = 40.2 dBi for both arrays. Number of elements in the

size of each element is 3λ, ––– 100 high-efficiency step horn array, ----121 pyramidal horn array.

modal-based analysis [34]. The numerical results reveal that the aperture efficiency 
of an isolated high-efficiency horn of aperture size greater than 3λ does not differ 
significantly from that in an infinite array environment. The difference was within 
1.5% only for horns with 3–4.5λ aperture dimensions. Furthermore, using the meth-
odology presented by Bird [29], the embedded element gain for the center element 
of a 3 × 3 element array differs by 0.1 dB only from an isolated element gain. Thus, 
two independent approaches confirm that the mutual coupling can be ignored for 
those cases considered.
4.7.2	
In Multiple-Beam Reflectors
A second important application of the high-efficiency horn lies in satellite multiple-
beam reflector antennas. A typical example is shown in Figure 4.21. The continental 
United States is divided in a number of hexagonal cells that share the total avail-
able frequency spectrum. The azimuth-elevation angular view shown in the figure 
is from the satellite geo-stationary orbital location. The antenna produces multiple 
beams to cover these cells. Following a four-cell reuse scheme, one of the frequency 
channels (A, B, C, or D in Figure 4.21) is assigned to each beam in an arrangement 
that maintains a minimum spacing between two cells of identical frequency and 
polarization. This arrangement reduces the RF interference between users located 
in different cells of the same channel frequency.
The antenna system consists of four-reflector apertures with a single feed per 
beam [35]. The four-aperture design allows increasing the feed aperture size by a 
factor of 2 compared to a single reflector design, improving significantly the spill-
over efficiency of the reflector antenna. In this example, the beams carrying channel 
A are produced by the reflector a fed by 12 feeds.
To show the advantage of the high-efficiency horn, the co-polar gain and 
the co-polar isolation of the beams were computed using Potter horn feeds and 
Figure 4.21  Hexagonal beam layout for a four-cell frequency reuse scheme implemented on a 
four-reflector multiple-beam antenna system.

Smooth Wall Multimode Horns for High Aperture Efficiency—Theory, Design, and Applications 
high-efficiency horn feeds with 87% aperture efficiency. The antenna performance 
was computed using physical optics reflector analysis software. The primary feed 
patterns were computed using the moment method analysis [27] and were fed to 
the antenna analysis software through a numerical data file.
The co-polar performance of the beams using channel-A is shown in Figure 4.22. 
The plot shows the minimum directivity over each cell. The result shows that the 
high-efficiency horn feeds improve the directivity of about 0.5 dB over Potter horn 
feeds. This improvement is primarily due to the larger edge taper of the reflector 
caused by the high-efficiency feed patterns. A large edge taper of the reflector results 
in a flat top type of beam, improving the directivity in the edge-of-coverage region.
Using the definition of co-polar isolation [35], the worst case co-polar isola-
tion for each antenna beam was plotted in Figure 4.23. A high-efficiency horn feed 
improves the isolation by 2.5 dB compared with a Potter horn feed. In the interfer-
ence calculation, contributions from the A-beams were considered only. In this case 
also, the increased edge taper of the reflector created by the high-efficiency horn feed

resulted in low sidelobes in the secondary pattern; hence the beam-to-beam co-polar 
isolation improved significantly.
It is worth mentioning that the horn efficiency value needed to optimize a mul-
tibeam antenna performance generally depends on many parameters, including the 
antenna geometry, the beam layout, and the frequency reuse scheme. In some cases, 
the highest horn efficiency does not produce the optimum antenna performance, 
and an intermediary horn efficiency value may be preferred. The modal contents 
at the aperture of the high-efficiency horn can be slightly perturbed to generate the 
desired aperture efficiency value while maintaining a good cross-polar performance.
4.8	
Conclusions
We presented multimode high-efficiency horn antenna structures for aperture effi-
ciency over 90%. The principle of operation of such a horn radiator was presented, 
and the design procedures of circular and square horns were outlined. The return 
loss, aperture efficiency, cross-polarization, and bandwidth characteristics were 
studied with respect to the horn aperture dimension. It was found that a circular 
high-efficiency horn has a better cross-polar performance than that of a square 
high-efficiency horn. Between step-and-flared and multiflared structures, the former 
showed somewhat wider bandwidth with respect to a moderate efficiency require-
ment. For narrow band operation, step-and-flared structure showed enhanced effi-
ciency performance. Since the steps provide additional flexibilities to a multiflared 
structure, a step-horn will always show improved performance compared to that of a 
flared-horn. For some scenarios, this improvement could be substantial. The proposed 
high-efficiency horns have potential applications in phased arrays and multiple-beam 
reflectors. It was found that in phased arrays, high-efficiency horn elements reduce 
the element counts as much as 30% for a desired array gain. In the multiple-beam 
reflector under consideration, a high-efficiency horn feed showed 0.5 dB more gain 
and 2.5 dB beam isolation improvement as compared with a Potter horn feed.

Introduction
Horns are required to give the desired illumination and to minimize extraneous 
reflections and sidelobes [1–5] when used as feeds for classical unshaped or shaped 
reflector systems, or as direct radiators. These horn properties are especially desir-
able in some applications such as for shaped beams from satellites that require the 
edge-of-coverage gain maximized or in radio astronomy and satellite ground termi-
nals where spurious sidelobes result in increased noise and interference. In addition, 
frequently, high aperture efficiency is desirable for individual feeds as well as for the 
reflector itself. In array feeds, for instance, the aperture sizes of the horns are usually 
small enough to ensure array grating lobes are not a problem, to satisfy beam spacing 
needs and to meet edge illumination requirements as well as to fit within the limited 
space in the focal region of the reflector, and often meet demands of a high efficiency 
over the operating frequency band. In some applications, such as on-board satellites, 
the array elements should also be as short as possible to minimize ohmic loss and 
weight. To meet these and other performance objectives, the walls of the horn and 
its lengthwise profile have been modified from a simple linear taper. Some common 
examples of horn profiles are illustrated in Figure 5.1. Conventional changes to the 
profile include steps and dielectric inserts and more recently profiled smooth-wall 
and corrugated circular horns [5–8] have been used. Other horns include multimode 
horns [9], partially dielectric-loaded horns [3, 10, 11], and high-efficiency horns, 
such as the scrimphorn [12].
With the advent of high-speed computer processing and accurate general analysis 
methods, it has become feasible to meet specific performance objectives in design. The 
most common types of horn in use today have circular and rectangular cross-section 
geometries, but these are not the only types available for high performance. Other 
cross sections employed include elliptical and polygonal shapes. Typical performance 
objectives for horn design include input reflection coefficient and aperture efficiency 
as well as sidelobe levels, maximum cross-polarization, and reflector edge illumina-
tion. The intention of profiling is to excite modes in the aperture with amplitudes 
and phases that meet the performance objectives. Profiling can be undertaken manu-
ally, as it has in the past, or automatically, as it is possible today. In this chapter, we 
outline ways of carrying out the latter approach and give some examples.

124
Profiled Horns and Feeds
Several methods have been adopted in the past to create a feed horn that meets 
all specifications. The most common approach, and historically the first one, was 
to vary the linear taper angle of the horn from the input exciter, usually a wave-
guide section where only a few modes can propagate, to a larger diameter where 
many modes contribute to the radiation pattern. A variation of this approach was 
to adopt several different tapers along the path [13] (see Figure 5.1). Apart from 
linear tapers, several alternative empirical profiles have been employed successfully 
such as sine-squared [13,14] and Gaussian [15] that give relatively broadband per-
formance and a bowl-shaped profile [16] that provides low sidelobes over a narrow 
5% bandwidth. Another approach is to introduce steps along the inside of the horn, 
where the steps and lengths between sections are chosen so that the modes arrive in 
the desired amplitude and phase relationship. As well as steps, uniform and linearly 
tapered sections have been used [9] to produce horns with high efficiency.
With automatic computer-based methods, it has now become feasible to design 
horns of general cross section with a nonintuitive profile that allows specific system 
objectives to be achieved on efficiency, directivity, radiation pattern shape, reflector 
edge illumination, or sidelobe levels. The 3 dB beamwidth of an individual aperture 
is usually constrained within certain limits by the physical dimensions of the aper-
ture as well as the mode content, but in an array configuration further variations are 
possible due to the excitation strategy and mutual coupling. This chapter describes 
some possible approaches in an array and some results achieved so far. Before doing 
this, we will discuss the physical limits that bound the possibilities provided by opti-
mization of the profile and of profiled horns in general.
5.2	
Basis of Optimum Horns
The design of horns to achieve optimum performance has been attempted in many 
different ways. The horn profile is only one option. Other options include the linear 
Figure 5.1  Examples of horn profiles: (a) linear, (b) stepped, (c) corrugated, (d) sine-squared, 
(e) Gaussian, and (f) general.

flare [17], aperture shape [18], and flange additions from chokes [3] to curved or 
nonplanar surfaces [19]. While selecting these options, there are system performance 
measures that need to be addressed. These include factors such as directivity (and 
aperture efficiency), input return loss, beamwidth, sidelobes, phase center and envi-
ronmental factors such as operation in a vacuum, or physical limitations imposed 
by the application. Each of these aspects will now be considered.
5.2.1	
Pattern Constraints
The field radiated by a horn of arbitrary cross section has a general distribution on 
a hypothetical surrounding spherical surface that has no planes of symmetry. The 
resulting radiation power pattern can be represented diagrammatically by a three-
dimensional plot or by several planar cuts. Fortunately, most horns in common use 
are either axisymmetric or have only two planes of symmetry. In both instances, pat-
tern cuts in three planes are usually sufficient to fully describe the radiation pattern. 
With these planar cuts, as well as orthogonal pattern cuts for the dual polarizations, 
the radiated field can be fully represented. Taking into consideration the co-polar 
and cross-polar patterns, it is possible to apply constraints on the radiation pattern 
of the horn during the design process. This is similar to the implementation of con-
straints such as for the design of shaped beam patterns with reflectors using an array 
feed [20]. It is usual to implement these feed pattern constraints in the three planes 
in both co-polar and cross-polar directions. Figure 5.2 shows typical constraints on 
the co-polar and cross-polar pattern cuts. Upper and lower bounds are often applied 
on the co-polar pattern. On the cross-polar pattern, there is usually only an upper 
Figure 5.2  Radiation pattern envelope constraints.

Profiled Horns and Feeds
bound as shown. For a reflector application, the level of the bounds on the primary 
feed pattern is usually determined from the secondary pattern requirements of the 
reflector such as the edge illumination, spill-over, or peak cross-polarization. Each 
type of reflector system has its own physical limitations and requirements that need 
to be included in the specifications. For example, concerning cross-polarization in an 
axisymmetric parabolic reflector, the peak level, for linear polarization applications, 
is given in the 45º plane, and the corresponding peak for the horn feed is typically 
+4 dB above that of the requirement of the overall secondary pattern.
5.2.2	
Input Mismatch
The input reflection is determined by discontinuities along the length of the horn in 
combination with reflection from the aperture. Additionally it will be impacted by any 
reflection from the nearby secondary system, such as a reflector or lens. Frequently, 
the horn return loss is measured in isolation in an anechoic environment so that its 
performance is known independently before installation as a feed. The bandwidth 
of the horn is usually given by the input reflection coefficient. Whether the horn is 
simple linear, profiled, or corrugated, any perturbations on the walls or the interior 
due to imperfect manufacturing or extraneous objects contribute further to the return 
loss. In some environments, if the performance allows, a radome is placed over the 
aperture to ensure dry surfaces, and any oxidation does not increase the reflection 
level over time. The base level of reflection can be controlled by the design of the 
horn profile, and this is included in the automatic procedure described in Section 
5.4. The reflection coefficient is usually specified and constrained by an upper bound 
only in the same way as for the cross-polar pattern in Figure 5.2.
5.2.3	
Aperture Efficiency
In some applications a feed with high aperture efficiency is desired. The aperture 
efficiency of a horn antenna is defined as the ratio of the effective aperture area and 
the physical area and is equivalent to the ratio of the horn gain to that of a uni-
formly illuminated aperture, which is 4πA/λ2, where A is the aperture area and λ is 
the wavelength at the operating frequency. It was shown by Silver [1] that close to 
maximum gain is produced with a uniform aperture field. This led to an approach 
of exciting the modes in the aperture of a horn with amplitudes that approximated 
a uniform aperture distribution. However, as pointed out by Silver [1], the assump-
tion of a high efficiency with a uniform aperture distribution is strictly true only for 
a constant phase distribution as well. The study of high efficiency horns commenced 
in the 1940s with aspects of this work reported by Silver [1] and Jakes [2], where the 
TE10 and TE30 modes are used in the aperture of a box horn. An increased efficiency 
over a single mode was reported with high-order mode amplitude of about 35%. 
A rectangular horn operating in only the TE10 mode has a maximum aperture effi-
ciency of 81%, but with several high-order modes, higher efficiency can be obtained. 
In general, uniform aperture amplitude is obtained with TEn0 modes of amplitude 
1/n, where n is odd [21]. In addition, the present authors [22] achieved high effi-
ciency with rectangular horns by profiling. Other examples, with square waveguide 
sections, for dual polarization, are shown [23–25]. Multiple mode circular horns

have also been developed by Love [26], Potter [27], and Koch [28]. More recently 
Bhattacharyya and Goyette [9] and also Ruggerini [29] obtained circular horns with 
higher aperture efficiency.
Maximum aperture efficiency is found by maximizing the gain relative to the 
physical area of the aperture. Bouwkamp and de Bruijn [30] and later Riblet [31] 
showed that there is no theoretical limit to the related quantity, directivity, for a 
linear antenna of any given size, if the current distribution is unconstrained. This 
could lead to efficiencies close to and in excess of 100%. Such high efficiencies for 
horns imply no infringement of physical limits as it indicates only that the effec-
tive radiating aperture is greater than the physical area. A gain greater than that 
produced by a uniform aperture distribution is called a supergain. This topic has 
been discussed in the past by many workers [4, 32], usually in connection with 
two-dimensional arrays. For a horn, an aperture distribution can be synthesized by 
exciting and phasing the modes between the input and the aperture, although there 
is less flexibility in aperture synthesis for horns than for arrays, because individual 
modes have to be excited with correct amplitude and phase. Nonetheless, it is use-
ful to consider what aperture efficiency might be achievable under certain practical 
constraints. In the design of individual horns, there are some other basic physical 
limits that cannot be exceeded through design variations. These are related to the 
size of the aperture and the aperture configuration and are limited by physical dif-
fraction and the currents on the aperture walls and the aperture flange. For arrays 
there is the added complication of mutual coupling between modes at the aperture 
and in adjacent apertures. However, there are means of including this in an analysis. 
We will assume that the horn is excited by an input probe or a waveguide section 
where several modes can propagate. The horn aperture efficiency in the direction 
(θm, ϕm) is defined as [1]

t is defined by (5.4). In this simplified case, as indicated 
by (5.4), the maximum aperture efficiency depends only on the geometry of the 
aperture and the modes that have been excited. The maximum aperture efficiency 
in the ideal case has been evaluated for circular, rectangular, coaxial, and elliptical 
aperture shapes for incident fundamental modes, and the asymptotic results for the 
first three cross sections are listed in Table 5.1 [22, 33].
In Table 5.1, N is the largest integer satisfying αmN < ka, and the indices n or p 
run over the N modes above cut-off. Note that the summation for each efficiency in 
Table 5.1 is only over the TE modes. This demonstrates that TM modes do not con-
tribute to the efficiency, as pointed out originally by Bhattacharyya and Goyette [9].
It is emphasised that the expressions in Table 5.1 are asymptotic expressions for 
large N and have been simplified by the omission of the wave admittance term in 
(5.2), which is related to the scaling of 
(0)
S
and is close to unity except near mode 
cut-off, in order to show the trend as the number of modes increases. The actual 
situation as described by (5.1) is that modes couple at all apertures. This results in a 
series of maxima above the underlying efficiency curve given approximately by the 
expressions listed in Table 5.1. The maxima occur in the vicinity of the mode cut-off 
frequencies and can have levels exceeding 100% over a range of frequencies. This 
leads to the possibility of horn designs where efficiencies can exceed or approach 
100% for part of their operating range as demonstrated [22].

5.2	
Basis of Optimum Horns

The aperture efficiency expressions given in Table 5.1 confirm that a rectangular 
aperture supporting only the TE10 mode has a maximum value of 81%, and for a 
circular or coaxial aperture with the TE11 mode only (m = 1) excited has a maxi-
mum of 100%. Higher efficiencies are physically possible over narrow bandwidths 
by exciting more than the fundamental mode and, in the present context, through 
design of the horn profile. With higher cut-off modes only in the aperture, such as 
only the axisymmetric TE modes (m = 0) or the double periodic TE modes (m = 
2), the efficiency limits to a lower value. For the axisymmetric modes the limit is 
12.5%, while for double periodic modes it is 50%. Another way to achieve high 
efficiency is with dielectric loading. Horns with dielectric loading have been used 
to give aperture efficiencies approaching 100% [10], although in some applications 
weight and materials properties, particularly outgassing and ohmic losses, become 
additional considerations especially in space-borne applications.
Small aperture horns, with sidelength or diameter less than one wavelength, are 
known to give high aperture efficiencies. This is due to combined effects of aperture 
reflection and significant currents on the surrounding flange [3]. In these and other 
applications, the length of either conventional or dual-mode horns is relatively long 
due to the use of linear tapers from the waveguide input to the waveguide step to 
excite the TE30 mode. Stepping or profiling can be used to reduce the length of these 
tapers (see Section 5.5.5).
5.2.4	
Phase Center Stability
The phase center of the horn at any given frequency is determined mainly by the 
size of the aperture, the profile slope immediately inside the horn—the flatter the 
slope the better, and the mode content. For a reflector antenna with a fixed focal

point, the horn phase center should be as constant as possible over the required fre-
quency band while achieving the desired illumination. For operation over moderate 
or wide bandwidths, it is important to ensure that the horn pattern is stable and 
does not vary significantly with frequency. If it does, the apparent phase center also 
moves forward or back, causing loss of efficiency and aberrations. The best way 
to ensure there is stability is to have a stable co-polar pattern, which often means 
that the main modes contributing to the radiation pattern are well above cut-off. 
This means a slightly larger aperture may need to be adopted that is consistent with 
other requirements. The phase center can be obtained from measurement or from 
numerically obtained data.
One approach is to estimate the phase center from the two-dimensional discrete 
patterns using the method of least squares [34]. In the pth azimuth plane, ϕp the phase 
center for a symmetric structure is approximated by [5, 35]

The simplest estimate corresponds to a single cut (NP = 1). A better estimate 
is to average the phase centers of the two principal plane patterns (NP = 2). With 
circularly symmetrical feeds, an average of the two principal planes plus the inter-
cardinal plane (45° and 135°) phase centers (NP = 4) is usually sufficiently accurate 
for most purposes. When the phase is uniform, (5.6) gives kdp = 0 as expected. Also, 
(5.6) is invariant to integer multiples of 2π in Φ. Finally, (5.6) can be easily adapted 
to continuous functions by converting the summations to integrals and M over the 
subtended angle.
When (5.6) and (5.7) are used to determine the apparent phase center of a horn 
feeding a reflector, the angular range (and hence M) should encompass the opening 
angle of the reflector from the focus. For example, if a horn feeds a subreflector 
with a subtended angle of 20°, and the data for the feed pattern and phase is over a 
wider range, only the data for the angles subtended by the reflector should be used. 
For example, consider the main reflector subtending an angle of 72°, and the feed 
horn has a symmetric quadratic phase error of +/−θ 2, which is typical of a flared 
horn. The phase center calculated from (5.6) over only a 20° range is −/+ 0.344λ, 
while for the subtended main reflector range the phase center is estimated to be −/+ 
0.356λ. This difference is small, but it would lead to overall lower gain and filling 
of sidelobe nulls. Both calculations demonstrate that with an increasing phase from 
boresight, the phase center is inside the horn, while with decreasing phase from 
boresight the phase center is outside the aperture.
The phase center could also be included in the optimization process. This could be 
undertaken directly such as bounding it with a maximum radius or indirectly through 
another parameter such as beamwidth, whose range is limited over the frequency 
band, realizing that indirectly this will tend to make the phase center spread smaller.
The phase center is frequency dependent, and it is necessary to define an overall 
phase-center position for a given frequency band sampled over N discrete frequen-
cies (f1,f2,…,fN). Let fmin be the minimum frequency in this frequency band. The 
frequency dependent phase-center position is defined at each frequency as given by 
(5.7), namely (dpc(f1),dpc(f2),…,dpc(fN)). These estimates are used to define the overall 
phase center as:

From practice, this overall phase center position calculation has been shown to 
be a good compromise. Equation (5.8) shows that if the phase function does not 
vary greatly from one frequency to the next, then the overall phase center is stable.

Compactness and/or Physical Constraint Due to Existing Environment
In some reflector installations, there is limited space in the vicinity of the focus for 
installation of the feed horn and the associated feed system. For example, it is con-
ventional, in radio astronomy installations, to have a focal cabin where several feed 
systems are mounted close to the focus before being moved into position. In other 

132
Profiled Horns and Feeds
applications, such as for space flight, it is important that the horn weight is mini-
mized. In these and other situations it is useful to have a horn design available that 
is compact and has a moderate to short length, without compromising performance. 
In some designs, the length can be one of the criteria in the optimization. There are 
several ways of doing this. Lengths, diameters, or number of horn sections can be 
optimized through a combination of manual and automatic means. For instance, the 
horn length could be set initially and the other parameters established automatically. 
The horn length could be altered and the design re-performed. The results from one 
computer run to the next are then compared. Usually there is a compromise between 
compactness and other parameters such as return loss. If the performance is accept-
able at some specified length, a new, shorter length can be tried and the process 
repeated. This is continued until all parameters are acceptable for the application.
Regarding the horn weight, even with a compact horn, for further weight reduc-
tion it may be necessary to employ lightweight materials [36, 37]. Horns made in 
this way can usually be designed by the same methods as for fully metallic ones. For 
example, the corrugated bowl-shaped horn shown in Figure 5.4 was designed by 
conventional mode matching software [16]. It was manufactured from carbon fiber 
with a composite supporting shell that, fortunately, did not require much change 
to the original design [36]. However, in some cases, this may not be possible, such 
as when a full metallic seal cannot be achieved at the bottom of corrugations but 
only at spot welds. In such instances, it is important to have an analysis software 
package that is capable of taking into account the actual horn geometry. When this 
software package is linked to the automatic optimization method (to be described 
in Section 5.4), a profiled horn can still be designed to meet performance objectives 
as well as being physically realizable. Acceptable upper and lower bounds should 
be placed on the length of the horn in an automatic process to help control the 
optimization procedure.

Choice of Horn Profiles
This section describes how, by profiling, many of the conflicting demands of horn 
design can be satisfied. The theory provided in the previous section allowed us to 
make observations about the design of high-performance feeds and sets the scene 
for profiled horns. Such a horn is represented diagrammatically in Figure 5.5. The 
modes incident on the aperture can be excited individually, as originally described 
by Cohn [38], for example, or through design of the mode converter section, which 
is essentially the approach used here. In the next section, we describe a numerical 
optimization of the profile(s) of a horn to design the mode converter to achieve the 
highest efficiency possible over a specified frequency band. In addition, the aim is to 
reduce the length of the taper from the waveguide input; that is, achieve compactness. 
Results are given in Section 5.5 for a variety of profiled horns that meet additional 
constraints than imposed in Section 5.2.
The objectives described in Section 5.2 can be implemented in several different 
ways. The traditional approach is through a series of steps in the horn. The approach 
to be outlined here uses a smooth profile. In the traditional approach, the steps are 
chosen to achieve the appropriate phase transition of the modes from an earlier 
section to the next and also to arrive at the terminating aperture with the desired 
amplitude and phase. In this approach conventional mode matching can be used [3, 
21]. In summary, this method is based on a number of usually uniform waveguide 
sections. If

A similar analysis applies for a profiled horn, except that there are usually many 
more sections and the resulting profile is almost continuous. The advantage of adopt-
ing a smooth profile for analysis is that the steps are small, usually < λ/10, and the 
modes are only partially reflected at each discontinuity. To simplify and speed up 
the optimization, a perturbation approach could be used to calculate the scattering 
matrices as described in Section 5.5.4.

Optimization of Horn Profile
5.4.1	
Possible Approaches
There are basically two ways to approach profiling of a horn. One is to use known 
empirical curves, and the other one is to somehow generate a profile that is controlled 
by a set of parameters that can be manipulated automatically.
5.4.1.1	 Empirical Profiles
There is a small set of empirical profiles that have been used in the past. The empirical 
curves were used mainly when the available computer power was not sufficiently fast 
to analyze the performance of the horn. A summary of these profiles was provided 
[39] but is repeated here for convenience.
We consider circularly symmetric horns with an input radius ai, an output radius 
ao, and a length L, as shown in Figure 5.6. In some of the profile options, we use the 
parameter p, the power of the function used for the profile, that is, “sin,” “tan,” and 
so on, which can take any value from 0 to ∞. In the literature, it is common to use 
p = 2 only. Experimenting with different values of p for a profile is very effective in 
radiation pattern shaping, especially with respect to the sidelobe and cross-polar-
ization levels. The choice of the profile will depend on the particular application.
We now summarize the most common empirical profiles available to the horn 
designer [3, 13, 15, 19]:

 in (5.11–5.13).
Various antenna groups around the globe have also worked on combinations 
of such profiles; notably at the CSIRO (Australia), where Thomas and Greene [19] 
have used a linear profile followed by a spherical profile; and also Granet, Bird, 
and James [16], where a linear-profiled step is followed by a sine-power function; 
at the Queen Mary University of London (UK), multiple linear sections [40] have 
been adopted; at the University of Navarra (Spain) [15, 41], Gaussian profiles have 
been cascaded; and at the University of Florence (Italy) [42, 43], sine-squared and 
exponential profiles have been combined together.
5.4.1.2	 Parametric Profiles
A parametric profile is fully represented by a mathematical curve with a small num-
ber of parameters. Some of the empirical profiles presented in the previous section fit 
this definition, by, for example, optimizing the power of the profile [44], but they are 

136
Profiled Horns and Feeds
limited in the number of parameters that can be optimized. The authors, however, 
use these empirical profiles as a good starting point for further profile optimization 
as explained.
The majority of circular horns and also rectangular horns, smooth-walled, cor-
rugated or dielectrically loaded, are analyzed using the mode-matching technique [3, 
21] as outlined in Section 5.3. Considering the fact that the horn is approximated 
by a series of circular steps, some corrugated horns have been optimized based on 
varying the radius and length of each and every one of the circular steps under the 
control of an optimizer for a given penalty function [45, 46]. Although effective, 
this method requires either significant computing power or a long design phase. A 
variant of this method was used in [47], where a smooth-walled horn was optimized 
to provide the desired radiation pattern by allowing each section to have its radius 
and length optimized. A cubic spline was then fitted to the points defining the sec-
tions to provide a so-called serpentine-profile.
When the authors were investigating ways to optimize the profile of a horn by 
minimizing the number of optimization parameters to speed up the design process, a 
method of spline-profile optimization was devised that is loosely based on Deguchi, 
Tsuji, and Shigesuwa [47], and this method has proven very successful. It is summa-
rized in Figure 5.7. The optimization of corrugated or smooth-walled spline-profile 
horns [6, 7], for example, allows the horn designer to limit the number of param-
eters to be optimized. Only a few points, or nodes, are used along the length of the 
horn to generate the profile. A cubic spline is then generated through these nodes to 
define the profile of the horn. The nodes are the parameters that are optimized by 
the design procedure. This minimizes a penalty function, taking into account user-
defined performance indicators for the given application, for example, combinations 
of return loss, cross-polarization level, directivity, sidelobes, beamwidth, and so on.
The basic representation of the spline-profile optimization technique is shown 
in Figure 5.7, where the profile is described by an input radius (ai), an output radius 
(ao), and six intermediate nodes (a1 to a6) located at various distances from the input 
of the horn (L1 to L6, usually fixed values). The optimization procedure takes as 
input the radii (a1 to a6) as well as ao and applies the geometry constraints, (d1 to 
d6 and do, which are usually fixed values, to minimize the searchable parameter-
space and take into account the mechanical constraints of the application. Note that

Optimization of Horn Profile

the example shown in Figure 5.7 has seven parameters, but the authors and other 
researchers have optimized horns with fewer nodes, and also up to 17 nodes to define 
the spline-profile. A full explanation of the algorithm is provided in [7]. Note that 
this technique is now used by a number of horn designers [48–52], but note that in 
Lucci et al. [48], a NURB is used instead of a spline, but the technique is equivalent. 
This technique has also been included in commercial software packages, CHAMP 
from TICRA [91] and the Microwave Wizard from Mician [92].
Another method, pioneered in the 1970s [38], but now improved and used by a 
number of horn designers, is to have a multisectional profile of linear segments for 
which lengths and angular slopes can be optimized. This method has been used to 
design either smooth-walled or corrugated horns [38, 40, 53–56].
5.4.2	
Optimization Methods
There are a wide variety of multivariable optimization methods that could be used 
in the present application to satisfy the various requirements. These methods may be 
constrained or unconstrained and global, for example, Genetic Algorithm, Simulated 
Annealing, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Differential Evolution, or local, such 
as Gradient Search, Steepest Descent, and others [57–60].
Know-how is needed in the use of these methods, however, to ensure a quick 
convergence of the design, by allowing sufficient parameters to be optimized, and, 
more importantly, to be able to tailor the penalty function to be minimized to the 
specifications of the application. An approach to optimization of the horn profile is 
illustrated in Figure 5.8.
A penalty function to be used in optimization can be constructed to take into 
account the N discrete frequencies of interest for the application (f1, f2, …, fN) and 
apply associated weights (w1, w2, …, wN) that can be used by the designer to favor 
selected frequencies in the performance. Another important parameter will also be 
a return-loss target at each frequency (RLT1, RLT2, …, RLTN) (note that return loss 
is a positive quantity), a cross-polarization pattern target at each frequency (XPT(1,
θ), XPT(2,θ), …, XPT(N,θ)), and a radiation pattern target in either relative power, 
normalized to 0 dB or in dBi. The radiation pattern target is usually defined, for 
each frequency, as a set of lower and upper bounds at given θ angles with 0 ≤ θ ≤ 
θMax, (LB(1,θ), LB(2,θ), …, LB(N,θ)), and (UB(1,θ), UB(2,θ), …, UB(N,θ)) [6, 7]. 
A typical radiation pattern envelope is shown in Figure 5.2.
A possible penalty function to be minimized sums up the different non-­compliant 
contributions, that is, when the calculated value for the current geometry at a given 
frequency exceeds the target value specified for the design at this frequency. For 
example, a penalty function constructed in Fortran 2008 language is as follows:
SumRL = 0: The contribution due to the return loss non-compliance
SumXpol = 0: The contribution due to the cross-polarization non-compliance
SumSL = 0: The contribution due to the radiation pattern non-compliance

The optimizer is then set to minimize the ObjectiveFunction value.
Note that the indices NSL, NRL, and Nxp can be specified by the user to weight 
the different contributions of sidelobe, return loss, or cross–polar level, respectively.
Other contributions can be added to this simple objective function, for example, 
the phase center. It is good practice to record the different contributions to keep track 
of what the optimizer improves the most or the least, given the parameters currently 
optimized. By these means, the horn designer determines the various impacts on 
the performance and therefore can influence the selection of different optimization 
weights. Some other examples of objective functions are found in Jamnejad and 
Hoorfar [45] and Lucci et al. [61].
It is very important to have a good starting point for the optimization, as this 
will reduce the search-time of the optimizer and therefore will result in a shorter 
design phase. Keeping a database of older designs, such as design approaches [37, 
62, 63] and configurations available from the open literature that can be scaled or 
modified to suit a new requirement is very important to ensure the optimization 
process starts with a geometry that has a good chance of success in meeting the 
performance requirements.
The authors favor constrained local optimization methods over the global meth-
ods in the present application because, in our experience, they provide a good com-
promise between design-time and realized performance. The reason for constraining 
the parameters, that is, providing the optimizer with a minimum and maximum value 
for each parameter, is to ensure the final design meets the mechanical constraints of 
the application, as well as minimizing the search-space of the optimizer. However, 
a number of designs have been successfully optimized using global optimizers (for 
examples, refer to [45, 49, 54, 61]). Combinations of different optimizers at vari-
ous steps of the design phase can also prove valuable. If, for example, you do not 
have a good starting point, it is good practice to use a global optimizer to generate 
a reasonable starting solution and then use a local optimizer to further improve 
that solution.
5.5	
Examples of Horn Designs
Some examples of profiled horn design are provided in this section. This selection 
is by no means complete for new designs are produced all the time. However, those 
described here give a sample of the power of profile optimization for feed applications.

140
Profiled Horns and Feeds
5.5.1	
Corrugated Horn
In one particular design [6], manual profile optimization was used by the authors 
originally to shorten the length of low-frequency horns at L-band in order to mini-
mize the horn’s weight and, therefore, the cost of the system. Initial work on a more 
automatic method of profiling was directed at designing compact, low sidelobe cor-
rugated horns [6] to operate over the 10.70–12.75 GHz band. For this application, 
an initial corrugated horn design was produced with length of 680 mm. Through 
optimization, the length was gradually shortened after several cycles to arrive at an 
acceptable length that was 25% shorter. This new horn had 125 corrugations com-
pared to 165 in the original design, and importantly it had a similar performance.
Since then, profiling has also been used to improve the cross-polarization per-
formance as well as sidelobe levels of corrugated horns [15, 16, 41], and particularly 
horn designs employing the empirical profiles described in Section 5.4.1.1.
Profiling is also used widely to optimize the radiation pattern of a horn over 
two or multiple separated receive and transmit bands for satellite applications, both 
on-board and terrestrial [64–66].
Although a Gaussian-type radiation pattern is desirable in many reflector feed 
instances, some applications may be better addressed by a horn exhibiting sectoral-
pattern behavior, [67–70].
5.5.2	
Smooth-Walled Circular and Coaxial Horns
One of the advantages of smooth-walled horns is that they are easier to manufac-
ture and are lighter weight than corrugated horns, they can work over a reasonably 
wide bandwidth, but they cannot achieve low cross-polarization performance over 
as wide a band as a corrugated horn.
The ease of manufacture is a big advantage for high-frequency applications 
greater than 60 GHz and into the THz region, where the manufacture of corrugated 
horn is extremely difficult and costly.
Another advantage of smooth-walled horn is in array applications, where they 
can be packed more closely than corrugated horns because the overall diameter, for 
a given aperture size, is smaller by about half a wavelength.
A large number of designs for high-frequency operations have now been reported, 
for example ≈100 GHz [7], ≈300 GHz [71], ≈700 GHz [56] and ≈840 GHz [72].
As in the case of corrugated horns, smooth-walled horns can be optimized for 
multiband applications, for instance C-band [73], Ku-band [49], and Ka-band [74, 
75]. The overall length for a given diameter horn can also be controlled, which is 
important for applications where weight or compactness are required. Smooth-walled 
horns have also been optimized to provide high efficiency [29, 33, 53].
Additionally, adoption of a central conductor in a coaxial horn can provide an 
extra parameter with which to design and to provide wide beamwidths for deep 
dishes (f/D < 0.35) [5, 76] or for mechanical support as in self-supporting feeds [5]. 
Coaxial horns generally have higher reflection coefficient, wider beamwidth, and 
higher cross-polarization over a narrower bandwidth than an equivalent unfilled 
circular horn. Profiling can help to improve the performance of all properties.

5.5	
Examples of Horn Designs
141
The maximum gain that can be obtained with circular and coaxial horns was 
described in Section 5.2. This indicates efficiencies of the order of 100% are possible 
under conditions of modest requirements on sidelobes and cross-polarization. An 
example of what can be achieved is now provided for an application in Ku-band 
that required a short, lightweight horn with a −16 dB edge illumination at 35° from 
boresight. The minimum first sidelobe required was ≤ −20 dB, and the maximum 
cross-polar level was ≤ −30 dB below the peak. A high efficiency was also desired.
The method outlined in Section 5.4 was used to meet the specified sidelobe and 
cross-polar levels and also a high efficiency.
A circular horn with a 2λ aperture diameter was designed with these proper-
ties to operate over the frequency range 11.7–12.2 GHz [33]. The simplified theory 
described in Section 5.2 predicts a maximum efficiency of 100%. With an optimized 
profile, even though there were constraints on the patterns and input reflection 
coefficient, the predicted aperture efficiency at the center frequency was still able to 
achieve a value of 97%. The fabricated horn is shown in Figure 5.9. The measured 
return loss is >25 dB across the band, while the measured efficiency is greater than 
95% (see Table 5.2). The length of the horn is 80 mm (3.2λ) and is significantly 
shorter than similar horns with linear profiles, which are typically twice as long 
for a similar bandwidth, higher sidelobe levels, and lower aperture efficiency. The 
profile, shown in Figure 5.10, contains several damped oscillations along its length, 
with peak-to-peak amplitude varying by about 8 mm.
The principal plane radiation patterns and gain were measured. The measured 
and computed gain is compared in Table 5.2 at several frequencies in the band, while 
the measured and computed radiation patterns at 11.95 GHz are shown in Figure 
5.11. There is excellent agreement between the computed results from mode-matching

Coaxial horns can be designed using the same approach as employed for the 
circular horn, except that there are now two profiles to be optimized correspond-
ing to the inner and outer conductors. A set of nodes and cubic splines are required 
for each profile.
5.5.3	
Rectangular Horn
In common with the coaxial horn, two profiles have to be optimized for a rectangu-
lar horn; in this case the profiles are in orthogonal planes, as depicted in Figure 5.5. 
The profiled rectangular horn considered here has been optimized by the method 
described in Section 5.4 [22]. In this approach, profiled horns were designed with 
aperture sizes ranging from 1.25 to 3 wavelengths for use as array feeds in the 
11.7–12.2 GHz band. The 2λ × 2λ aperture horn design is shown in Figure 5.12, 
and the profiles are illustrated in Figure 5.13. The actual aperture distribution in 
the E-plane of this horn is compared in Figure 5.14 with that of a horn with a 
conventional 2λ × 2λ aperture horn with a linear flare. We see that both amplitude 
and phase for the profiled horn vary across the aperture, and it is these variations 
that lead to high efficiencies. All horns achieve aperture efficiencies close to 100%, 
and at the same time have a return loss >20 dB and a cross-polar isolation >22 dB. 
The radiation pattern in the 45º plane of the horn at 11.95 GHz is shown in Figure 
5.15. The measured aperture efficiency at this frequency was 101.1% [22]. The total 
length of the 2λ × 2λ aperture horn is 3.2λ at 11.95 GHz, and as with the profiled 
circular horn, its profile undulates in amplitude along its length that reduces toward 
the aperture, as may be seen in Figure 5.13.

5.5.4	
Dielectric Rod and Horn
The dielectric rod antenna may be preferred as a feed for some millimeter-wave and 
THz frequencies due to the potential of low insertion loss. In the design of such 
antennas, the relationship between the radiation pattern and the profile has been 
discussed by several authors, including, Zucker [78] and Ando et al. [79]. There are 
design guidelines for achieving specific radiation pattern objectives, such as maximum 
gain and minimum sidelobes [78]. However, in general, the optimum rod profile for 
a given radiation pattern is difficult to determine by analytic means.
Dielectric rod antennas have in the past been designed using the discontinuity 
radiation concept [78], in which the antenna is treated as a linear array of effec-
tive sources arising from the radiation at discontinuities experienced by the surface 
wave traveling along the antenna as well as a contribution from the feed radiation 
not converted into the surface wave by the exciting feed. The total radiated field is 
the sum of all these sources.
To produce maximum gain on boresight, the usual approach is to gently taper 
the dielectric rod profile toward its end. This tapering results in a larger starting 
diameter, which supports a slower surface wave that is more tightly bound to the 
rod than on smaller rods. This results in a higher excitation efficiency of the sur-
face wave. Additionally, a smaller terminating diameter causes the surface wave to 
become weakly bound to the rod, and consequently the mode field, typically that 
of the fundamental HE11 mode, expands into the surrounding free–space region 
and radiates. This increases the size of the effective aperture at the rod termination, 
leading to an increase of overall gain. Tapering also reduces the difference between 
the surface wave propagation constant and the free-space propagation constant 
at the rod termination, minimizing the reflection of the surface wave at the end of 
the rod. The length of a tapered profile must be sufficient to ensure the appropriate 
phasing can be maintained between the feed radiation and radiation occurring along 
the rod profile, and particularly at the rod termination, in order to maximize gain.
Commonly employed rod profile tapers are linear, exponential, and curvilinear 
[78–80]. Ando et al. [81] demonstrated that high-order curvilinear tapers could be 
used to minimize the conversion of the surface wave into radiation modes along the 
length of the rod and hence maximize the amount of the power remaining in the 
surface wave at the rod termination. The taper also increased the radial extent of 
the equiphase region at the rod termination due to the surface wave, hence improv-
ing the gain.
The profiled horn approach can be applied to dielectric rod antennas as shown 
by Hanham et al. [82]. Rods with various profiles were created, depending on the 
constraints applied. Some of these dielectric rod antennas are seen in Figure 5.16. 
Pictured in Figure 5.16 is a linear profile design (LIN), a dielectric rod designed for 
a minimum sidelobe level (SL), and another designed for maximum gain (MG2). 
As an example, Figure 5.17 (solid curve) shows the SL profile design. Significantly, 
the rod has a slight flare near its termination, and this helps to control the input 
reflection coefficient. All profiles were designed using an approach similar to that 
described in Section 5.4, and the radiation patterns were calculated with MWS 
[93]. For the optimization procedure, a method of moments (MoM) analysis [83, 
84] was used. The MoM approach uses an ideal ring slot feed [85] to excite the rod 

146
Profiled Horns and Feeds
while MWS permits both this approximate model and also accurate feed models 
to be used. The introduction of a ring-slot feed disrupts the rotational symmetry of 
the structure and modifies the radiation pattern slightly from that predicted by the 
body of revolution-MoM approach.
The three rod antennas shown in Figure 5.16 were machined from Emerson & 
Cummings Eccostock HiK rods, with a measured permittivity εr = 9.74, using a CNC 
lathe with a carbide tip tool. The source ring-slot and feed was etched on a 0.010-
inch thick, Rogers RT/Duroid 6010 high-frequency laminate with εr = 10.2. The 
feed consists of a coplanar waveguide (CPW) network with a quarter wavelength 
matching section for the ring slot.

The radius of the ring slot was tuned in each case based on simulation to achieve 
a 10 GHz resonant frequency. The radiation patterns of the three rod antennas were 
measured, and the results obtained were compared with the computed results in [82] 
at 10 GHz. A summary of the computed and measured gain results and also the 
first sidelobe level of the rods is given in Table 5.3; further results may be found in 
[82]. As an example of the results obtained, Figure 5.18 shows the principal plane 
patterns for the low sidelobe profile design (SL).
A number of different rod profiles were optimized to achieve low sidelobes. 
­Several designs had oscillatory profiles where the oscillation amplitudes were too 
small to radiate significant power along the length of the rod. However, the rod 
profile, which gave the best sidelobe performance over a 10% bandwidth, had an 
optimized profile that is close to 1/νth-order power curvilinear. That is,

where ρstart and ρend are the radii of the rod at the feed and termination ends and 
ν > 1. For the present SL case we see from Figure 5.17 that (5.18) gives a close 
match to the optimized profile when ν = 3.5 with ρstart = 0.17λ and ρend = 0.085λ 
except near the flare at the termination. The ρstart and ρend values were found from 
the optimized design and are larger than those suggested by Zucker [78] for a longer 
6λ0 rod antenna with low sidelobes. The expression (5.18) was proposed by Ando 
et al. [81], who showed that a 1/3 order profile (ν = 3) minimizes radiation along 
the rod’s length, ensuring that the amount of energy reaching the end is maximized. 
This leads to an inherently broadband design because the pattern is almost entirely 
determined by the radiation from the rod termination rather than the summation 
of multiple radiation points along the rod length. It is shown [82] that the rod pro-
file causes a gentle expansion of the surface-wave along the entire length of the rod

antenna (SL) that was designed for low sidelobes. (a) E-plane and (b) H-plane.

with no observable radiation from the rod except at its end. The ring slot produces 
a small amount of feed radiation, which radiates to the rear of the rod and diffracts 
around the rod base, interfering with the field in the forward direction; however, this 
is a minor effect. The radiation pattern, shown in Figure 5.18, has a maximum first 
sidelobe level of −18.5 dB below boresight in the E- and H-plane. This is better than 
the −17 dB cited by Zucker [78] for a minimum sidelobe design. This improvement is 
primarily due to the low feed radiation resulting from the high launching efficiency 
of the ring slot. For the design shown in Figure 5.17, a first sidelobe level of <−17 dB  
is maintained across 7% of the frequency band. In addition to the low sidelobes, 
the gain of the SL rod is >2 dB above that of a rod with a linear profile; see Table 
5.3. This increase is due to the better utilization of the rod length for expanding the 
surface-wave field. The measured radiation pattern varies slightly from the simu-
lated results due to the interaction of the ring slot radiation with the ring slot feed. 
This effect is most evident in the sidelobe at angles greater than 60º. At most other 
angles the sidelobe level of the measured results are less than the simulated levels.
Table 5.3 summarizes the calculated and measured boresight gain for the three 
rod designs, and it can be seen for the SL design that the measured result is 1.1 dB 
less than the calculated value. This is partially due to losses not being included in 
the simulation such as dielectric loss and loss in the feed. Further analysis indicated 
the dielectric ohmic loss is approximately 0.2 dB and loss in the feed circuit board 
is 0.4 dB. The estimated total loss is 0.8 dB for the SL rod, including connector loss 
and impedance mismatch with the ring slot. The remaining loss is thought to be 
due to the ring slot operating slightly off resonant frequency. Although the gain is 
underestimated, there is still reasonable agreement between the shape of the mea-
sured and simulated SL radiation patterns (Fig. 5.18).
5.5.5	
Arrays of Profiled Horns
Individual profiled horns can be designed and combined in the manner used for 
conventional horns for array feed applications [5]. For accurate design, mutual 
coupling should be included in the formulation as outlined in Section 5.3 [21, 77, 
86, 87]. It is also possible to carry out a full design by restricting all the horns to 
be the same or allowing some or all to vary in the optimization process. A network 
representation of the array is shown in Figure 5.19. To outline an approach [21, 87] 
for an array of profiled horns, let the complex input mode amplitudes to an array 
of N horns be

One need not alter the geometry of all horns during optimization. Some horn 
geometries could remain fixed. Also, for some applications it is simpler if the horns 
can be assumed to be identical and the performance improved by optimizing the 
profiles with full mutual coupling. If the mode content of the apertures and their 
diameters remain fixed, the mode coupling matrix is unchanged and need only be 
calculated once. The flow graph shown in Figure 5.8 can be used as a basis for the 
design software even for an array. The most time-consuming aspects are the initial 
assembly of the scattering matrices of the array coupling and the horns and particu-
larly the inversion of the full N × N matrix

An example of a design of a compact circular profiled horn for an array feed 
application is described by Hellicar et al. [88]. A multibeam array feed was required 
for a radiotelescope with a half-angle of 56.4° that operates from 0.95–1.45 GHz. 
A key aspect of the design was the transition from an input waveguide of specified 
diameter, which was set by the output of the orthomode transducer, to a suitable, 
larger aperture while achieving the desired edge illumination and frequency range. 
The design of a single horn was originally undertaken in isolation and then later 
tuned in the array environment using software that incorporates mutual coupling 
[77], assuming 19 identical elements and an array in a hexagonal cluster. The result-
ing horn design is only about 100 mm in length (~0.4λ), and is shown in Figure 
5.20. The profiled horn is about half the length of a traditional stepped horn design 
that achieves a similar performance, and, as a consequence, the new design has 
less weight. An input return loss of >17 dB was achieved with this design over the 
desired frequency range, that is, about 42% bandwidth. The radiation pattern of 
the profiled horn design is typical for a TE11 mode horn in that the edge illumina-
tion varies from −8 dB to −14 dB across the band. The maximum cross-polar level

in the 45° plane is < −20 dB. Other profiled horn designs for array applications are 
described in the literature for frequencies 30–38 GHz [89], 210–250 GHz [90], and 
660–740 GHz [56].

Conclusion
This chapter has outlined the history of employing the horn profile in design to 
achieve a suitable operating performance. In particular, we have shown that by 
means of modern computational methods for both representing the horn structure 
and for automatic design through optimization, nonintuitive horn structures can be 
created that meet performance specifications. Representative examples were described 
that demonstrate the power of this design approach for general horn types that are 
metallic smooth-walled, corrugated, or open structures such as dielectric rods. It is 
anticipated that profiled horns will be employed more frequently in the future to 
develop designs that are fit for the purpose of meeting ever demanding requirements, 
whether for communications, science applications, radar, or security.

Soft and Hard Horn Antennas

Introduction to Hybrid Mode Horn Antennas
Hybrid-mode horns were first described by Minnett and Thomas [1], who showed 
that linearly polarized (LP) modes with perfectly straight field lines can be supported 
if an anisotropic boundary on the waveguide or horn wall can be designed that meets 
the balanced hybrid condition
	
= η
TE
TM
0
2
Z
Z
	
(6.1)
where ZTE and ZTM are the TE and TM boundary impedances, respectively, and η0 
is the free-space wave impedance. The hybrid mode produces radiation patterns 
with very low (ideally zero) cross-polarization at the design frequency. Due to the 
propagation of a single mode, these horns exhibit an inherently large bandwidth. 
In a circular waveguide, (6.1) applies to any LP mode, assuming the boundary (e.g., 
transverse corrugations) is implemented with rotational symmetry. Therefore, any 
two orthogonal modes will have identical field distributions in E-plane and H-plane, 
respectively, across the waveguide or horn aperture. This results in perfect circularly 
polarized (CP) radiation patterns with very low cross-polarization at the design fre-
quency, assuming that a perfect 90° polarizer is connected to the horn.
Many horn antennas published in the literature show some of the characteristics 
of hybrid-mode horns but do not meet the criterion in (6.1). They have in general 
either lower bandwidth, higher loss, or higher cross-polarization when compared 
with hybrid-mode horns. These horns are often preferred if they meet the require-
ments needed for the specific application because they may offer lower weight or 
cost (e.g., dual mode or multimode horns; see Chapter 4). However, for applications 
where performance is the driving requirement, hybrid mode horns may be preferred.
Although (6.1) was developed for horns with a circular cross section, it applies 
in the most general sense to horns with any cross section. However, hybrid mode 
horns with circular symmetry have larger bandwidth than hybrid mode horns with 
other cross sections. One reason is that the balanced hybrid condition for the two 
orthogonal modes will have in practice different frequency variation over the band. 
Two hybrid mode horns with noncircular aperture known from the literature are 
elliptical and rectangular horns. These horns are particularly interesting because

they generate elliptical beams and are used as feeds in elliptical reflector antennas 
for radar and satellite applications.
6.2	
Definition of Soft and Hard Surfaces
The concept of soft and hard horn antennas was first published by Lier and Kildal 
[2]. This paper presented an analysis based on a circular cylindrical model of a hard 
horn with longitudinal strips on a dielectric wall liner, demonstrating that a TEM 
wave can actually be supported in the air-filled interior of a strip-loaded circular 
cylindrical waveguide. The paper also presented the first mathematical formula-
tion of the concept of soft and hard electromagnetic surfaces based on anisotropic 
boundary impedances, as well as the first experimental proof-of-concept. Detailed 
derivation and discussion of these surfaces were later published [3, 4]. This work 
was inspired by the development of a horn with circumferential strips on a dielectric 
wall liner [5, 6], representing an alternative to the widely used corrugated horn. Both 
of these horns are soft horns according to the EM boundary definition described 
in this chapter.
The study of the hard strip-loaded horn was also inspired by a horn published 
by Aly and Mahmoud [7], which had longitudinal corrugations filled with dielectric. 
This corrugated horn represents the first published hybrid-mode high-efficiency horn 
or hard horn concept. Although the authors of that paper demonstrated analytically 
that the horn provided high directivity, they did not mention explicitly the genera-
tion and support of a TEM wave in the central horn region.
Soft and hard horns can be defined by the electric E and magnetic H field com-
ponents tangential to the boundary xz-plane, expressed as

where x is the transverse component of the wave relative to the direction of propa-
gation and z is the direction of propagation. To meet these conditions the surface 
has to be anisotropic with respect to EM propagation.
The soft horn is characterized by tapered field distribution over the aperture, 
generating Gaussian-like radiation pattern with low sidelobes, as illustrated in Figure 
6.1. This characteristic makes the horn ideal as a single feed for reflector antennas, 
resulting in high gain due to low spillover loss outside the reflector, and as a satellite 
antenna providing global or regional beams. The hard horn supports uniform field 
distribution over the aperture, which results in high directivity due to high aperture 
efficiency, and with corresponding high sidelobes (see Figure 6.1). Therefore, this 
horn is ideal as an antenna element in arrays, resulting in high gain and low grating 
lobes for boresight as well as scanned beams. It is also suited for other applications 
where high gain is needed but where the aperture size is restricted, for example, as a 

6.2	
Definition of Soft and Hard Surfaces

cluster feed element for reduction of spill-over loss in multibeam reflector antennas 
[8]. Finally, hard horns may find applications as spatial combiners for quasi-optical 
amplifier arrays [9, 10].
Lier and Kildal [11] published a qualitative analysis of aperture distributions 
and radiation patterns of soft and hard horn antennas, showing that any aperture 
distribution between the two extreme cases, soft and hard, could be envisioned. The 
relationship between peak directivity, sidelobe level, boundary impedance, and edge 
taper (relative signal strength at the boundary relative to the center of the wave-
guide) was presented. They also proposed how such an intermediate soft-hard horn 
or “selectable gain horn” could be designed by the use of a graded index dielectric 
core. An alternative concept for such a soft-hard horn was proposed [2] by loading 
the wall by metal patches on a dielectric liner.
Soft and hard surfaces can also find applications beyond horn antennas. Since 
soft surfaces suppress propagation along a boundary, they can be used to increase 
isolation between antennas or to reduce diffraction around corners and other discon-
tinuities. Hard surfaces can be used to make objects invisible (cloak) with reduced 
radar cross sections for any polarization. This was first proposed and demonstrated 
experimentally [12, 13] on struts in reflectors where hard strip-loaded and corrugated 
liners were applied to the surface of the strut with elongated or rhombic-shaped 
cross section to further minimize reflections. This is possible when the direction of 
the incoming wave is known, which always occurs in fixed antenna systems but is 
less effective in applications where the incoming waves arrive simultaneously from 
different directions.
In summary, soft and hard horns are hybrid-mode horns, supporting a single 
mode under balanced hybrid condition with resulting low (ideally zero) radiated

cross-polarization at the design frequency. This enables frequency reuse with high 
isolation between the dual polarized signals.

Soft and Hard Horn Designs and Implementations
6.3.1	
Soft Corrugated Horns
The first known hybrid-mode horn, the corrugated horn, was invented in the 1960s 
[14, 15]. It was the only known type of hybrid-mode horn for almost 20 years. The 
corrugated horn has since been analyzed in depth, and numerous designs have been 
built and put to use [16]. It has been demonstrated to work with circular, elliptical, 
and rectangular aperture; with axial and radial corrugations; with ring-loaded and 
dual-depth corrugations; for single and dual hybrid modes; with flare angle from 
small to large, that is, from aperture controlled to flare angle controlled horn; with 
linear and profiled shape along the horn; and in applications for satellites and radars 
from microwaves to millimeter-waves.
This hybrid-mode horn does not need dielectric loading, which makes it particu-
larly attractive for high-power or satellite applications. It is being used as a feed in 
reflector antennas for satellite communications, both in on-board satellites and in 
ground terminal antennas, because of its low sidelobes and low cross-polarization 
over a large bandwidth. Low sidelobes are important to achieve high antenna effi-
ciency thanks to low spill-over loss outside the reflector. Low cross-polarization is 
critical to enable frequency reuse for dual polarization, resulting in doubling of the 
overall satellite communication bandwidth or capacity. Also, circular corrugated 
horns can be designed and analyzed quickly and very accurately with mode match-
ing software [17] due to the absence of dielectric material. Finally, it has no outer 
boundary region with electromagnetic fields that could increase radiated cross-
polarization, in contrast to all other known hybrid mode horns, which have some 
unwanted radiation from the boundary region. This effect will be described later in 
this chapter, during the discussion of the various soft and hard horn designs.
To support a balanced hybrid mode, the corrugation depth along the horn can 
approximately be expressed by
	
= λ
−
4
0
tcorr
hm
	
(6.4)
where λ0 is the free-space wavelength. This corrugation depth should be slightly 
modified for propagation in a cylindrical or conical waveguide [16]. To avoid higher 
order nonwanted modes, the corrugation depth has to be kept between a quarter 
and half a wavelength,
	
λ
λ
<
<
4
2
0

tcorr
	
(6.5)
In other words, the maximum achievable continuous bandwidth of a corrugated 
horn is under 100%. However, dual band design with band separation beyond 

6.3	
Soft and Hard Horn Designs and Implementations
161
an octave has been achieved with dual depth corrugations, although the achieved 
bandwidth is relatively narrow [16]. For best match from the smooth-walled input 
waveguide to the corrugated waveguide or horn section, the depth of the first cor-
rugations should be approximately half a wavelength, which electrically is equivalent 
to a smooth wall.
As discussed in the introduction, (6.1) could be extended to horns with any cross 
sections. However, for a noncircular cross section the challenge is to implement the 
boundary such that it meets the balanced hybrid condition for both modes at the 
center frequency and has similar frequency variation over the required frequency 
band. As an example, in a noncircular corrugated horn, this could be achieved 
in an approximate sense by making corrugations with varying depth around the 
waveguide. Elliptical and rectangular corrugated horns have been thoroughly stud-
ied in the past [16, Chapter 7]. The elliptical corrugated horn can be analyzed by 
expressing the hybrid modes as Mathieu functions. It is assumed that the boundary 
impedance is constant everywhere around the waveguide, which is most correct for 
small ellipticities. The square and rectangular corrugated horns are not amenable to 
exact analysis due to the corner regions. However, an approximate solution can be 
obtained by treating the waveguide as a rotated pair of two-wall E-plane corrugated 
waveguides, where each can be analyzed exactly.
Figure 6.2 shows a Ku-band elliptical corrugated feed horn developed for a dual 
reflector Gregorian satellite antenna. Measured radiation patterns of the horn were 
shown [18], which also presented an approximate model predicting co-polarized and 
cross-polarized radiation patterns of elliptical hybrid-mode horns. The cross section 
of the horn changes gradually from circular in the throat to elliptical with a 1.2:1 
aspect ratio in the aperture. This results in a very short and light feed horn without 
the need for an input transition section. The corrugation depth was held constant 
around the horn. Relative peak cross-polarization was well below −35 dB over 
almost the entire 11.7–14.5 GHz band, and below −33 dB at the lowest frequency. 
Figure 6.2  Photo of Ku-band elliptical corrugated feed horn for a Gregorian reflector antenna. 
Aperture aspect ratio is 1.2:1 [18].

162
Soft and Hard Horn Antennas
This bandwidth is twice as wide as reported in the literature for other experiments 
with a 2:1 aperture aspect ratio. The most likely reason is the smaller aperture aspect 
ratio, although the gradual change from circular to elliptical cross section could in 
part contribute to the bandwidth improvement. In the more common design with a 
constant cross-sectional ellipticity along the horn, a circular to elliptical waveguide 
transition is needed at the horn throat for matching purpose and to reduce the exci-
tation of higher order unwanted modes.

Horns with a Dielectric Core (Dielcore Horns)
6.3.2.1	 Soft Dielcore Horns
The dielcore horn was independently discovered in the early 1980s by two Euro-
pean teams [19–21] and was the first hybrid-mode horn after the corrugated horn 
to be invented. If a dielectric core with relative permittivity εr1 is inserted into the 
horn, leaving a gap between the core and the horn wall having a dielectric material 
with permittivity εr2 (which for most practical cases is close to unity), the balanced 
hybrid condition can be met if (see Figure 6.3)

Clarricoats, Olver, and Rizk [19] proposed a low dielectric (foam) core with 
relative dielectric constant εr1 ≈ 1.1–1.3, Lier and Aas [20] and Lier [21] used a solid 
dielectric core with εr1 ≥ 2 which could be implemented with a low-loss dielectric 
material, such as PTFE (Teflon), polystyrene, or polyethylene for the soft dielcore 
horn in Figure 6.3. A balanced hybrid mode can be supported inside the core if the 
gap between the core and metal wall meets the following requirement [21]:

Equations (6.7) and (6.8) show that the field propagation normal to the bound-
ary is evanescent. By combining (6.1), (6.7), and (6.8), the formula for the outer 
gap thickness required to support balanced hybrid propagation inside the core for 
grazing incident waves can be derived, resulting in

Since this formula was derived for plane wave incidence on a flat boundary, it is 
asymptotically exact for increasing waveguide diameter and approximately accurate 
in the radiating aperture.
Graphs of the thickness versus permittivity and versus aperture radius are derived 
based on a circular cylindrical model and are shown in Figure 6.4(a) and (b), respec-
tively. They show that the thickness decreases with increasing core permittivity and 
increasing aperture size. The horn exhibits an ideal soft condition (6.2) in the limit 
when the core permittivity goes to infinity, which can be derived from (6.7–6.9). 
However, for all practical purposes, the condition is close to soft for a solid dielec-
tric core with εr1 ≥ 2. For core permittivity close to unity the condition is far from 
soft, and the thickness of the outer gap increases exponentially, leaving less energy 
in the hybrid mode inside the core.
A crucial feature associated with this design is that the electromagnetic wave 
propagation normal to the boundary is evanescent in the outer region. This results 
in an intrinsic large bandwidth for propagation along the waveguide, in contrast 
to the propagation inside a corrugated horn where the resonant nature of the cor-
rugated wall boundary limits the bandwidth. Unfortunately, the dielectric-air aper-
ture discontinuity imposes a bandwidth limitation for dielcore horns with high 
dielectric constant. However, with a matching layer (“quasi-blooming” layer) on 
the dielectric-air aperture boundary, an octave bandwidth was achieved with peak 
cross-polarization 30 dB below co-polarization peak for a horn with a solid dielec-
tric core material made of polystyrene [21]. This is shown in Figure 6.4(c), and 
the corresponding measured return loss is shown in Figure 6.4(d). Circular holes 
were machined into the dielectric aperture surface, where the hole diameter, hole 
depth, and hole spacing were designed properly to generate a quarter-wavelength 
matching layer with center frequency at 12.5 GHz. For horns with a low permittiv-
ity core a matching layer in the aperture may not be needed. The return loss in the 
horn throat is inherently low for these horns since the dielectric core can be easily 
shaped for optimum performance. The measurements show that although the cross-
polarization bandwidth is an octave, the return loss bandwidth is smaller due to 
worse performance in the lower band. The return loss bandwidth can be extended 
by optimization of the throat region.

It should be noted that the electromagnetic field in the outer region will add 
to the radiation from the hybrid mode in the dielectric core region and modify the 
radiation pattern, which slightly deteriorates the rotational symmetry and increases 
cross-polarization of the radiation pattern. This effect is more pronounced for diel-
core horns with low relative core permittivity [19] since their outer region is larger 
in area with higher relative field strength (field less confined to the core) compared 
to dielcore horns with high core permittivity [21]. Unwanted radiation from the 
boundary region could be reduced by placing an absorber ring around the outer 
aperture area.
The propagation characteristics in an elliptical dielcore waveguide were accu-
rately analyzed by Lier and Rengarajan [22]. The study demonstrated that only an 
approximate balanced hybrid mode can be supported, assuming the dielectric core 
boundary and metal wall boundary has the same ellipticity. Lier, Rahmat-Samii, and 
Rengarajan [23] discussed the applications of dielcore horns with elliptical beams. 
An experimental verification of dielcore horns with a solid dielectric core and with 
elliptical and rectangular cross-sections were presented [24]. The horns were built 
for use as a reflector antenna feed in a microwave radar system (see Figure 6.5). 
The required feed beamwidth was 60° × 120° for −14 dB relative pattern level, cor-
responding to slightly under 2:1 aperture aspect ratio for both horns. Peak relative

cross-polarization under −30 dB over more than 30% frequency band was achieved, 
which is a considerably wider band than what has been reported for elliptical and 
rectangular corrugated horns. Approximate analysis of propagation and radiation 
behavior in a rectangular dielcore waveguide with about 2:1 aperture aspect ratio 
was reported [25]. It was shown that for horns with a relative core permittivity of 2.5, 
relative peak cross-polarization under −30 dB is achievable for circularly polarized 
fields over more than 80% bandwidth, and probably over an even wider bandwidth 
for linear polarization. The corresponding bandwidth for a horn with relative core 
permittivity of 1.5 is 50%. Dielcore horns with a solid dielectric core have also been 
demonstrated for millimeter wave frequencies at 94 GHz and 175.5–191.5 GHz 
[26, 27]. For these implementations, the spacing between the core and the horn wall 
was provided by leaving radial spacers or rings as an integral part of the core wall. 
For lower frequencies the spacing can also be provided by rings or flexible sheets of 
low dielectric materials (e.g., foam or honeycomb).
A dielcore horn with a solid dielectric also has a natural built-in aperture lens 
that can be shaped for different applications. If designed as a focusing lens, the horn 
length can be reduced compared to a horn without a lens for the same gain [21]. 
The lens surface can also be synthesized to replace the secondary reflector in a dual 
reflector Gregorian antenna, generating similar co-polarized and cross-polarized 
radiation performance as the dual reflector antenna [28] (see Figure 6.6). Such a 
single feed reflector antenna can have packaging and cost advantages over the dual 
reflector system for some applications.
The soft dielcore horn in Figure 6.3 has so far seen few microwave applications 
due to either dielectric losses in the core, high-power limitations for use in ground 
station antennas, or potential ESD (electro-static discharge) issues and additional 
weight for satellite antenna use. Weight and dielectric losses can be reduced to a 
minimum if the core is built up as an artificial dielectric by sandwiching high per-
mittivity dielectric plates together with foam or honeycomb spacers [29] (see Figure 
6.7). Also, higher power could be enabled if the core is built from ceramic material. 
However, a better use for the soft dielcore horn in Figure 6.3 could be for millimeter-
wave applications [26, 27] and potentially THz applications because of its simple 
design and potentially low cost constructions.

6.3.2.2	 Hard or Selective Gain Dielcore Horns
A different dielcore horn concept was published [30, 31]. It applies an additional 
intermediate dielectric layer between the outer gap and the core, resembling the con-
cept proposed in Lier [21]. This horn can be designed for any intermediate boundary 
condition between soft and hard, that is, a “selective gain horn.” Ideal soft or hard 
condition can be achieved by the right combination between the layer thicknesses 
and dielectric constants (see Figure 6.8). A design requirement is that the relative 
permittivity of the intermediate layer εr2 is higher than that of the core material εr1, 
and that the relative core permittivity is higher than that of the outer gap material 
εr3. In other words, the horn can be designed to satisfy the balanced hybrid condi-
tion in the central core if

Similar to the propagation in the soft dielcore horn in Figure 6.3, the wave 
propagation normal to the boundary in the outer gap region is evanescent for this 
horn as well. Although the horn can be designed as a soft horn, its bandwidth is not 
as wide as for the simpler soft dielcore horn design in Figure 6.3 due to the addi-
tional dielectric layer. However, it may have lower weight and lower loss than the 
solid dielcore horn since the core may be made of a low density dielectric material,

such as foam, honeycomb, or artificial dielectric. This may in addition eliminate the 
need for a transformer layer in the dielectric-air aperture. It also represents the only 
known hard dielcore horn, as well as the first hybrid-mode horn to provide selective 
gain, depending on the design. For some antenna systems this enables the overall 
performance to be optimized beyond what is possible with only soft or hard horns.
Computing the co-polarized and cross-polarized radiation patterns of dielcore 
horns can be performed by using the model of a single hybrid-mode propagation 
in a cylindrical waveguide. This is demonstrated in Lier [21] for the soft horn and 
in Lier and Kishk [31] for the selective gain horn. The electrical and magnetic tan-
gential field components on the boundaries between different layers are matched, 
resulting in a matrix equation for the determination of the propagation constants 
and field coefficients in the waveguide. By applying the solution to a waveguide with 
the same cross-section as the aperture of the horn under study, and by imposing a 

168
Soft and Hard Horn Antennas
spherical phase front over the aperture corresponding to the horn flare angle, the 
far-field radiation patterns can be computed by standard aperture integration tech-
niques. This approach is most accurate for relatively small flare angles since it models 
a single mode only. For large or nonlinear flare angles where higher order modes 
are no longer negligible, a mode matching approach would result in more accurate 
radiation patterns [32]. Although these analysis techniques are fast and efficient, they 
cannot easily be used on rectangular or nonsymmetric structures, and they require 
the generation of complex computer codes. For these applications, the method of 
moment (MoM) code is an alternative. Such codes are today commercially available 
and run relatively fast for most dielectric loaded horn designs (e.g., WIPL-D, FEKO).
To demonstrate the ability to design the horn with selective gain, the horn was 
designed with a number of aperture field distributions between soft and hard (see 
Figure 6.9(a)). Each distribution is designed to meet the balanced hybrid condition,

dielcore horn shown in Figure 6.8, with approximately 3λ aperture diameter and uniform phase

to satisfy the balanced hybrid condition for each case [31]. (a) Aperture field distribution (solid

resulting in rotational symmetry and straight field lines inside the core with low 
cross-polarization. The aperture distributions are plotted in the 45° plane, and the 
transverse field components are identical over the aperture under balanced hybrid 
condition. In the boundary region between the core and the horn wall, the field 
distribution is not rotationally symmetric. The plotted aperture distribution shows 
that the transverse tangential φ-component of the field is continuous across the 
discontinuities, while the radial component is not, as expected. The corresponding 
antenna patterns are plotted in Figure 6.9(b). The first pattern models a hard horn 
with highest gain and relative sidelobes around −19 dB, exhibiting 92.3% aperture 
efficiency. This assumes a uniform phase front in the aperture that could be achieved 
by profiling the horn as shown inserted. The last pattern represents a soft horn, 
showing reduced directivity and lower relative sidelobes. The plots also demonstrate 
relative cross-polarization below −35 dB for all cases, proving that a hybrid mode 
under approximate balanced hybrid condition can be designed for any distribution 
between soft and hard for this horn.
To demonstrate the bandwidth potential for a hard dielcore horn, it was opti-
mized for maximum aperture efficiency over the Ku-band based on a cylindrical 
model (see Figure 6.10). Two different designs were tried, one with more weight on 
efficiency (solid curve) and the other with more weight on bandwidth. The results 
indicate that high efficiency and low cross-polarization can be achieved over the 
band, allowing the horn efficiency and bandwidth to be traded for optimal antenna 
system performance.
A method-of-moments (MoM) analysis was performed on a profiled dielcore 
horn to study how much higher order modes will affect performance [31]. Figure 
6.11 shows aperture efficiency (a) and relative peak cross-polarization (b) over the 
band. The computed aperture efficiency (dashed curves) is considerably higher than 
what was analyzed for a single mode based on a cylindrical model. This difference

cylindrical model (single mode). The two set of curves correspond to two slightly different designs, 
exemplifying the trade between aperture efficiency and bandwidth [31].

is due to a combination of higher order modes and aperture edge currents modeled 
by the MoM code. The oscillating nature of the plots is mostly due to reflections in 
the horn aperture and can be reduced by applying a matching layer in front of the 
two dielectric-air aperture boundaries, as shown in Figure 6.11. The analysis illus-
trates that aperture efficiency is only moderately affected while cross-polarization 
is considerably improved with aperture matching.
The horn in Figure 6.8 can also provide a flat-top pattern, as demonstrated in 
Figure 6.12. By exploiting the fields in the boundary region, as shown in Figure 
6.12(a), a sinc-like aperture distribution can be obtained with a resulting flat-top 
pattern shown in Figure 6.12(b). This type of patterns can be used as global horns 
onboard satellites.

Soft Strip-Loaded Horns
A soft horn with circumferential strips on a dielectric wall liner was published [6] 
based on a plane wave model. A photo of the horn is shown in Figure 6.13(a). It 
was shown that the balanced hybrid condition could be met at two frequencies, in 
contrast to the corrugated horn, where balanced hybrid modes can be supported 
at a single frequency only. The work on the strip-loaded horn was extended [33], 
where a more accurate analysis was performed in a cylindrical waveguide (see Figure 
6.13(b)). The paper also quantified the effects of radiation from the dielectric region 
in the aperture on the levels of cross-polarization.
For the soft strip-loaded horn, the thickness of the dielectric wall liner for bal-
anced hybrid mode propagation is approximately given by

where εr is the relative permittivity of the liner. This formula is asymptotically exact 
for increasing waveguide diameter and corresponds to the lowest of the two balanced

hybrid mode frequencies [33]. Compared to the thickness of a corrugated wall given 
in (6.4), we see that the two wall thicknesses are the same if εr = 2.
An experimental demonstration of the soft strip-loaded horn was presented [6], 
and a photo of this horn is shown in Figure 6.13(a). Relative cross-polarization under 
−27 dB from 11−14 GHz was achieved. Only limited effort was applied to optimize 
its performance due to the lack of design and analysis tools. Similar to corrugated 
horns, strip-loaded horns exhibit a resonant behavior caused by the strip-loaded 
wall, which limits its bandwidth to approximately an octave. However, since a bal-
anced hybrid mode can be supported at two separate frequencies, the horn antenna 
is ideal for dual band transmit and receive satellite applications, such as Ku-band 
or Ka-band.
The circumferential strips can be etched out on a thin dielectric layer and wrapped 
and bonded inside of a hollow dielectric cone. This subassembly can then be mounted 
inside a conical metal horn (see Figure 6.13(a)). For rectangular or square horns, 
the boundary can be made from flat surfaces. This is a relatively low-cost process. 
When compared to a corrugated horn, the overall aperture diameter of the soft 
strip-loaded horn is smaller. This is because the thickness of the dielectric liner is 
smaller than the corrugation depth for εr > 2. The overall weight may also be less.
6.3.4	
Hard Strip-Loaded and Corrugated Horns
The hard strip-loaded horn with longitudinal strips on a dielectric wall liner men-
tioned earlier in this chapter was analyzed [33] based on a cylindrical waveguide 
model. It was shown that a quasi-TEM balanced hybrid mode can be supported 
when the thickness of the dielectric liner approximately satisfies (6.11), which is the 
condition for balanced hybrid mode propagation in the soft strip-loaded horn. As in 
the soft horn case, this equation is asymptotically correct for increasing waveguide 
cross-sections and is therefore most accurate in the radiating aperture of the horn. 
The same formula also applies to the corrugation depth of the hard corrugated horn 
with longitudinal corrugations filled with dielectric material [7, 34]. A comparison 
between the two implementation approaches of hard horns was published in Lier 
[35] based on a cylindrical model analysis.
In Lier and Kildal [2, 34], an experimental investigation of hard strip-loaded and 
corrugated horns was presented. A photo of these horns is shown in Figure 6.14, and 
measured and predicted patterns are shown in Figure 6.15. Although the bandwidth 
was low due in part to the absence of accurate modeling and design software, the 
results represented the first experimental proof-of-concept of these horns.
It was further shown [33] that in addition to the hybrid mode, a microstrip 
line mode can be supported in the horn, which could significantly deteriorate 
antenna performance for many practical applications. A more accurate analysis of 
the hard strip-loaded horn was given [36], based on the mode matching approach, 
demonstrating that surface modes are indeed excited and supported in the horn, 
reducing the applicability of this horn. However, a way of suppressing this sur-
face mode is to apply vias between the longitudinal strips and the horn wall as 
proposed and modeled by mode matching [37]. This offers similar performance 
to that of hard corrugated horns but may result in a lower cost implementation 
and lower weight.

The hard corrugated horn was modeled and analyzed by mode matching [38]. A 
dual depth hard corrugated horn was proposed and studied [39]. An experimental 
demonstration of a dual band and multimode Ka-band hard corrugated horn was 
reported [40].
Finally, the bandwidth of a strip-loaded and corrugated hard horns based on a 
rectangular waveguide model was addressed [41]. The approximate analysis indicated 
that about 12% bandwidth for a 2λ aperture diameter is achievable for these horns.

Metamaterial Horns (Meta-horns)
6.3.5.1	 Introduction
Metamaterials is an artificial material or structure with subwavelength unit cells, 
typically below λ/5, that can guide electromagnetic waves in unprecedented ways.

For example, it can be designed to provide an effective index of refraction for the 
wave between zero and unity or even negative, or a graded index of refraction. At 
RF frequencies it can be constructed from metal, dielectric, and/or air (vacuum).
The idea of the metamaterial horns or meta-horns came from studying the two 
dielcore horns presented in Section 6.3.2 [42, 43]. The requirement for supporting 
the balanced hybrid mode in these horns is that the dielectric core material has a 
higher permittivity than the material in the outer region next to the wall. In order 
to remove the central core, obtaining εr1 = 1 (air, vacuum), the medium in the wall 
gap region has to be implemented effectively as a low permittivity metamaterial, 
that is, εr2 < 1 in Figure 6.3 and εr3 < 1 in Figure 6.8. This concept is illustrated in 
Figure 6.16. It is assumed that the relative permeability μr is close to unity for the 
dielcore horns. However, for the meta-horns the permittivity and permeability are 
dispersive in the metamaterial for all practical implementations, so the requirement 
for meeting the balanced hybrid condition is that the refractive index n = (εrμr)1/2 < 1. 
In other words, supporting a balanced hybrid mode requires a low index metamate-
rial in the outer region for both the soft and the hard (or selective gain) meta-horns.
Meta-horns and dielcore horns yield theoretically similar performance since 
the internal hybrid mode propagation is governed by the same set of equations pre-
sented in Lier [21] and Lier and Kishk [31]. They have evanescent wave propagation 
orthogonal to the boundary in the outer region, facilitating large bandwidth. Also, 
the hard meta-horn can be designed for selective gain and with flat-top patterns as 
shown in Section 6.3.2. One advantage of meta-horns over dielcore horns is the 
absence of a central core, which reduces weight and insertion loss and eliminates 
reflections from the dielectric-air aperture boundary [43]. These benefits make these 
horns considerably more attractive as feeds in satellite antennas and enable them to 
be used in high-power applications, such as ground terminal antennas for satellites 
and radars. A second advantage of meta-horns over dielcore horns is that they provide 
a new electromagnetic boundary that can be applied to open EBG (electromagnetic 
band gap) surfaces, high impedance surfaces, artificial magnetic conductors (AMC)

or ground planes, radar cross-section (RCS) reduction, or RF cloaking, and soft 
and hard surfaces in general. The main challenge in building meta-horns lies in the 
implementation of the meta-liners, which will be discussed in this section.
Figure 6.17 [43] illustrates these soft and hard metamaterial boundaries and 
compares them to conventional surfaces for grazing incident fields. The soft surface 
is simply a low-index metaliner or metasurface on a metal ground plane or wave-
guide wall. The hard surface similarly contains a low index meta-liner on the metal 
ground, with an additional dielectric liner on top. As stated previously, corrugated 
and strip-loaded surfaces exhibit resonant nature, limiting the continuous bandwidth 
to typically under an octave. Meta-surfaces on the other hand have evanescent wave 
propagation inside the metamaterial layer and normal to the surface. This facilitates 
large potential bandwidth, in particular for the soft meta-horn.
Since the EM propagation in a general region is uniquely determined by its bound-
ary conditions, the design of soft or hard waveguides and horns can be achieved 
by proper design of the wall impedances ZTE and ZTM satisfying (6.1). In the horn 
aperture, these anisotropic wall impedances can be approximately derived from a 
near grazing incident plane wave to the surface, resulting in approximate formu-
las for desired geometry and refractive index. These values can in turn be used as 
initial starting points in a cylindrical or spherical waveguide model with effective 
homogeneous liners, synthesizing the desired geometry (liner thicknesses) as well 
as the refractive index versus frequency. Low cross-polarization is automatically 
achieved if (6.1) is met. In the next step, the resulting geometry and refractive index 
dispersion are used as targets during the analysis and synthesis of the actual meta-
surface. This can be done most effectively by a full wave modeling software. A basic 
requirement for the metasurface geometry is that the unit cells or repetition period 
be much smaller than a wavelength such that the effective surface impedances and 
an equivalent refractive index can be found, ensuring good correlation between the 
uniform liner model and the actual implementation. In the final step, a parameter 
extraction technique can be performed to correlate the predicted complex reflection

coefficients from the surface to the effective index of refraction. This process will be 
demonstrated in the following section.
6.3.5.2	 Soft Meta-Horns
For the meta-horn proposed in Lier and Shaw [42], it was not at all obvious that 
metaliners were realizable over a reasonable bandwidth due to dispersion in the 
actual composite or complex material. Therefore, in this paper feasibility studies 
of both soft and hard meta-horns based on a cylindrical model were presented to 
ensure that the horn was implementable. The effective permittivity of the metaliner 
has to follow a Drude-type behavior [44, 45] to ensure it works over a reasonably 
large bandwidth. The Drude curve approximately models the EM propagation in 
a dense material with subwavelength unit cells or electric and magnetic molecules. 
The feasibility studies [42] indeed showed that the desired dispersion increased 
monotonically like the Drude curve both for the soft and hard meta-horns, which 
opened the possibility that an actual metaliner can indeed be realized over more 
than a narrow bandwidth.
Here a similar feasibility study for the soft metahorn over a multi-octave fre-
quency band is presented based on a cylindrical model. The relative permittivity 
providing minimum cross-polarization is analyzed and plotted against the frequency. 
The resulting curve is shown in Figure 6.18 [43]. The ideal permittivity increases 
monotonically between zero and unity, which constitutes a low index metamate-
rial, assuming the relative permeability μr is unity. The first order Drude term with 
an appropriate resonance frequency is plotted in the same chart, showing that the 
ideal permittivity curve approximately follows the monotonically increasing Drude 
curve over multiple octaves. This indicates that the low-index soft metaliner indeed 
can be implemented over a large or even multi-octave bandwidth. The bandwidth

will be limited by the excitation of higher order modes in the input waveguide to the 
horn unless they are fed by a multi-octave input section, such as a ridged waveguide.
Even though the feasibility of realizing the metaliner has been established, the 
design of the actual liner poses a substantial challenge. First the desired or optimal 
liner geometry and effective dispersion characteristics of the refractive index have 
to be generated to meet the particular requirements. The second step is to design 
the actual liner meeting the desired characteristics. The unit cell or periodicity of the 
metamaterial has to be much smaller than a wavelength (e.g. < λ/10) for the structure 
to be modeled as an effective medium. The first meta-horn experiment was performed 
for a single polarization C-band pyramidal horn [46–48]. Single polarization was 
selected to simplify the first attempt and thereby increase the chance for success. A 
pyramidal horn with an E-plane metaliner was chosen to compare the performance 
to that of an E-plane trifurcated horn [49, 50], proving that meta-horns can be used 
in real-world applications and not only as an interesting science experiment. The 
extended C-band (3.4–4.2 GHz downlink, 5.85–6.725 GHz uplink) was targeted 
since it represents one of the greatest challenges with respect to antenna bandwidth, 
weight, and cost for microwave horn antennas.
A photo of the C-band horn is shown in Figure 6.19. The effective refractive 
index of a homogeneous metaliner with respect to the internal field was first opti-
mized for best co-polarized and cross-polarized pattern performance and is shown 
in Figure 6.20(a). The real value of the relative permittivity increases monotonically 
with frequency from close to zero to close to 2, while the real value of the rela-
tive permeability is close to 0.2 over the entire band. The resulting refractive index 
increases monotonically from approximately 0.1–0.7 over the band (see Figure 
6.20(b)). The imaginary parts of permittivity and permeability (and the refractive 
index) are close to zero over the entire frequency band, indicating negligibly low 
loss. The metaliner is built up of a wire grid with a radial wire connected to the 
wall, a transverse continuous wire, and a piecewise broken wire along the horn 
[46–48]. Predicted and measured radiation patterns are shown in Figure 6.21. This 
first experimental demonstration of meta-horns provides over an octave pattern 
bandwidth with negligible loss.
It should be noted that this horn is not a true hybrid mode horn or soft horn since 
it was designed for single polarization only. However, since the top part of the wire 
grid is continuous in the transverse direction, the tangential E-field will be forced to

zero on the boundary in the H-plane, and approximate soft hybrid mode propagation 
is expected for both circular and rectangular horns. This is demonstrated in Figure 
6.22, where a similar soft boundary condition wire grid liner inside a conical horn 
was modeled and analyzed (graph provided by Q. Wu, C. P. Scarborough, and D. H. 
Werner at the Pennsylvania State University under contract with Lockheed Martin). 
Computed relative cross-polarization is below −33 dB from 11–17 GHz, and below 
−27 dB from 11–18 GHz. The wire grid liner has no dielectric material, which makes

this horn an excellent candidate for satellite applications and a real alternative to 
corrugated horns with the potential for lower weight and larger bandwidth.
A design approach for inhomogeneous metaliners with varying cell structure 
along the horn was demonstrated [51]. By engineering the metaliners with regard 
to their surface impedance as well as tailoring their spatial distributions along the 
wall of the horn, it was demonstrated that an inhomogeneous soft meta-horn with 
broader bandwidth compared to those with uniform liners was achieved. Relative 
peak cross-polarization below −30 dB was computed over an octave bandwidth, and 
return loss was above 20 dB over the upper 80% of the band. One particular chal-
lenge in the design of meta-horns is matching the band with low cross-polarization 
to the band with low return loss. This is due to the fact that the low index metaliner 
lowers the cut-off frequency in the horn throat, which drives the input diameter of 
the horn higher. The result is that cross-polarization in the upper band degrades due 
to excitation of higher order modes near the horn throat.
A nature-inspired optimization method was applied [52] in designing metasur-
faces with customized electromagnetic properties for soft and hard horn antennas. 
The designs of several metasurfaces and their use as liners for coating the interior walls 
of horn antennas were explored. The design process combines the genetic algorithm 
optimization technique with a full-wave electromagnetic solver to create dispersion-
engineered metamaterials that possess customized surface impedance properties. A 
metamaterial parameter extraction technique was developed and employed in the 
optimization process, which is based on the surface impedance expressions for a 
homogeneous slab backed by a perfectly conducting ground plane illuminated at 
near grazing incidence.
A square soft Ku-band meta-horn is shown in Figure 6.23 [53]. The metaliner 
in this horn was built with printed circuit board (PCB) technology, which ensures 
low cost manufacturing. The PCB consists of uniform metal patches on one side and 
a ground plane on the other, and with vias connecting the two sides. Figure 6.24 
shows predicted boundary impedances (a) and effective refractive index (b) versus 
frequency for the meta-liner. From the impedance chart we notice that in the lower 
frequency band, the boundary condition is closest to soft as defined in (6.2), and the

product of the impedances is closest to meeting the balanced hybrid condition as 
defined in (6.1). The refractive index stays below unity over the extended Ku-band. 
Similar to the E-plane meta-horn discussed previously, the curve is monotonically 
increasing similar to the Drude curve, and the imaginary part is small, indicating 
negligible propagation loss for the hybrid mode. Figure 6.25 shows predicted and 
measured radiation patterns. Relative peak cross-polarization close to −30 dB has 
been achieved in the lower band (12/14 GHz) and increases above −25 dB in the 17 
GHz band, which would need some improvement for satellite applications. If PCB 
liners can be implemented on a conical wall, substantial wider bandwidth can be 
achieved compared to pyramidal horns. Although the PCB technology cannot eas-
ily be implemented on curved surfaces, a conical soft meta-horn offers substantially

larger bandwidth compared to pyramidal horns. Figure 6.26 shows measured return 
loss at the square waveguide input, which is below −15 dB over almost the entire 
band but with deteriorating return loss in the lower band. This exemplifies the pre-
vious discussion on the return loss challenge.
This horn represents the first experimental demonstration of a true soft meta-
horn, proving that practical soft meta-horns with large bandwidth, very low loss 
and weight, and low manufacturing cost are achievable. Soft meta-horns may in the 
future replace corrugated and trifurcated horns with the potential for better overall 
antenna performance in a wide range of radar and satellite applications, such as 
tri-band [54] and extended C-band.
6.3.5.3	 Hard Meta-Horns
As mentioned in the previous section, feasibility studies of both a soft and a hard 
meta-horn were performed based on a cylindrical waveguide model [42]. In Figure 
6.27 the optimum relative permittivity curve for the hard metaliner generating maxi-
mum aperture efficiency and relative cross-polarization under −30 dB was plotted 
over the selected frequency band. A monotonically increasing dispersion curve from 
10.5–14.5 GHz was obtained. Since the desired dispersion curve is similar to the 
Drude curve, feasibility has been established for the hard horn as well. This band-
width is substantially larger than the 12% bandwidth estimated for the corrugated 
and strip-loaded hard horns presented [35, 41]. Corresponding co-polarized and

18 mm, aperture diameter = 80 mm, horn semi-flare angle = 7.5°) [42,43].

cross-polarized radiation patterns at low and high frequency over the band are plot-
ted in Figure 6.28. The predicted low cross-polarization demonstrates that a hybrid 
mode approximately satisfying the balanced hybrid condition is supported in the 
horn. The corresponding aperture efficiency curve is shown in Figure 6.29, ranging 
from above 80% in the lower band to above 90% in the upper band.

Hard Horns as Feeds for Array Antennas
The hard horn is ideal as a feed element in arrays with typically 2.5λ or larger 
diameter, which is needed for limited scan phased arrays and as feeds in multibeam 
reflector antennas. Maximum gain can be achieved by profiling the flare of the hard 
horn to obtain uniform aperture phase. Also, by making the aperture hexagonal 
approximately 10% (0.42 dB) higher array packaging efficiency can be achieved 
over a circular aperture (see Figure 6.30). Profiled hard meta-horns with circular and 
hexagonal aperture cross-sections were compared based on a method-of-moments 
analysis [55, 56] (WIPL-D). Figure 6.31 shows the ideal dispersion curve over the Ku 
transmit frequency band 12.2–12.7 GHz, while Figure 6.32 shows the corresponding 
aperture efficiency and cross-polarization. For both horns aperture efficiency over 
90% and relative peak cross-polarization below −30 dB was obtained over the band. 
Figure 6.29  Computed aperture efficiency and relative peak cross-polarization versus frequency 
based on a cylindrical model for the hard horn defined in Figure 6.16. The aperture of the horn is 
shown inserted. Maximum achievable aperture efficiency is between 94 and 96% caused by the 
aperture phase error from the 7.5° semi-flare angle [43].
Figure 6.30  (a) Illustration of array with (b) hard profiled hexagonal metamaterial horn elements 
[56]. As indicated, the hexagonal horn aperture offers 100% packaging efficiency while a circular 
horn aperture has 10% less aperture efficiency (ideally).

184
Soft and Hard Horn Antennas
The overall aperture efficiency of the array is unchanged for the hexagonal horn 
element due to 100% packaging density. However, for the circular horn element, 
the same efficiency is reduced by about 10%, resulting in 80–85% array aperture 
efficiency. As a result, the profiled hexagonal hard hybrid-mode horn has the largest 
potential array efficiency or gain of all known high-efficiency aperture horns. It should 
be mentioned that mutual coupling increases with increased horn and packaging 
efficiency, which should be accounted for when analyzing and designing the array.
For multibeam reflector antennas for fixed satellite services, this efficiency advan-
tage can be used to increase the overall antenna gain by reducing feed spillover loss 
outside the reflector. Alternatively, the increased efficiency can be used to achieve 
higher resolution for the beams on the ground by placing the feeds closer together 
[57]. In effect, additional satellite beams become available to cover the same region 
on the ground, resulting in increased traffic capacity.
A typical requirement for multibeam reflector systems is congruency between 
transmit and receive beams. A study was done to achieve the optimum feed efficiency

maximum aperture efficiency and peak relative cross-polarization below −30 dB for profiled circular

curve for an ideal hybrid-mode horn (i.e., symmetric aperture distributions) to achieve 
congruent beams from a multibeam parabolic reflector antenna [57]. Figure 6.33(a) 
shows the optimized feed efficiency curve versus frequency from 12–30 GHz, while 
Figure 6.33(b) shows the corresponding beam patterns, which demonstrate that 
the feed efficiency curve results in approximate beam congruency over the entire 
Ku-Ka band. The feed model used is described in Figure 6.33(c), which models an 
adjustable amplitude taper for optimization (parameter p). Feed-reflector spillover 
loss is naturally the highest at the lowest frequency, which is downlink or transmit; 
therefore high feed efficiency is more crucial in this band. The results show that for 
a 20/30 GHz Ka-band satellite antenna, the approximate ideal uplink feed horn 
efficiency is 9% less than the downlink horn efficiency. The corresponding num-
bers for a 12/14 and 12/17 GHz Ku-band antenna are approximately 3 and 6%, 
respectively. Lower required feed horn efficiency in the uplink or receive band is 
beneficial because it enables higher weight in the optimization of the downlink or 
transmit horn, resulting in higher efficiency. Following this approach in the design 
of the feed horn will result in a more optimum overall multibeam antenna system 
when compared to the more common requirement for constant or maximum feed 
efficiency over the transmit and receive bands.

frequencies over the band corresponding to the predicted frequencies in (a), and (c) feed aperture 
model. The reflector antenna analysis is performed by GRASP. The feed horn model is a circular 
open-ended waveguide aperture with diameter 2a = 81 mm with adjustable amplitude taper. 
The aperture distribution has perfect circular symmetry following the distribution in the radial 
direction according to the formula. The parameter p is optimized to provide an aperture efficiency 
that generates the desired secondary beam diameter. The reflector system has a focal length over 
diameter (F/D) of 1.4 [57].

Conclusions
Soft and hard horn antennas are hybrid-mode horns, which produce polarization-
independent co-polarized patterns and low cross-polarization for dual linear or cir-
cular polarization. Soft horns are low gain horns with low sidelobes, which makes 
them useful as single feeds for reflector antennas in radar and satellite applications. 
Hard horns with their high aperture efficiency and high gain are ideal as antenna 
elements in limited-scan phased arrays, feed elements for multibeam reflector anten-
nas [8], and potentially as spatial combiners for quasi-optical amplifier arrays [9, 
10, 58]. Some dielcore and meta-horns can be designed with selective aperture dis-
tribution and thereby selective gain. This feature could be exploited to optimize gain 
and sidelobes in various antenna systems where soft or hard horns do not provide 
optimal performance. These horns can also be designed with flat-top patterns, which 
can be used as global horns for satellite applications.
Table 6.1 shows a list of soft and hard horns known from the open literature 
and presented in this chapter [59]. They are listed in chronological order based on 
the date they were first published. The table presents a brief list of advantages and 
disadvantages for each horn, which should be considered typical rather than absolute.
Although the corrugated horn has been the only practical soft horn for almost 
fifty years, there are today alternative designs which could improve RF performance 
in some applications and reduce weight and cost in others. This is particularly the 
case for the soft meta-horn, which can be designed to provide an octave bandwidth 
or more. Hard meta-horns offer higher efficiency and larger bandwidth than other 
high-efficiency horns, such as multimode horns. The technology behind meta-horns 
is rapidly advancing and made possible by the development over the last decade of 
efficient EM design, analysis, and synthesis tools.

Circularly Polarized Feed Antennas

Introduction
Consider a communication system where an x-directed linearly polarized (LP) receiv-
ing antenna is located facing a y-directed LP transmitting antenna. In this case, the 
receiving antenna cannot receive the transmitted signals because the polarization 
of the receiving antenna (x-direction) is perpendicular to that of the transmitting 
antenna (y-direction) [1, 2]. To receive the transmitted signals, the polarization of 
the receiving antenna must be oriented such that it is parallel to the transmitting 
antenna’s polarization, and hence a 90° rotation is required in this case. On the 
other hand, in a communication system that uses circularly polarized (CP) receiv-
ing and transmitting antennas, the CP receiving antenna will receive signals as long 
as it faces the CP transmitting antenna; there is no need to adjust the orientation of 
the antenna polarization.
When high antenna gain is required for a CP communication system, a CP array 
antenna [3, 4] or a CP reflector antenna [5–7] is used. In the CP array antenna case, 
the complexity of the feed circuit design for each array element increases with the 
number of array elements; the loss in the feed circuits also increases, due to the 
increased path length from the source point to each array element. In the reflector 
antenna case, the issues with the CP array antenna case are not present, as long as the 
feed antenna for the reflector is composed of a single element or a small number of 
elements. For example, in a parabolic reflector antenna for direct broadcast satellite 
reception, a single CP feed antenna illuminates the reflector surface, and the reflector 
achieves a high gain (of more than 30 dBi) without significant feed line loss [7]. As 
a result, the parabolic reflector has higher aperture efficiency than its counterparts 
(microstrip array antennas) and has been widely applied.
There are numerous CP feed antennas for reflectors. Figure 7.1 shows techniques 
for generating a CP wave. One is based on synthesizing two LP waves, Ex and Ey, 
where the two waves have the same amplitude but have a ±90° phase difference. 
When the phase of Ey is regressive by 90° with respect to the phase of Ex, as shown in 
Figure 7.1(a), a right-handed CP (RH CP) wave is obtained in the z-direction; when 
the phase of Ey is progressive by 90°, a left-handed CP (LH CP) is realized in the 
z-direction, as shown in Figure 7.1(b). For brevity, synthesized circularly-polarized 
is often abbreviated as SYN CP in the following discussions.

194
Circularly Polarized Feed Antennas
The other technique for obtaining a CP wave is based on distributing a travel-
ing wave along a loop region on the antenna arm or arms; a CP wave is produced 
when the circumference of the loop region is one-guided wavelength (1λg). An RH 
CP wave is obtained in the z-direction, as shown in Figure 7.1(c), if the traveling 
wave flows in the counterclockwise direction; an LH CP wave is obtained in the 
z-direction, as shown in Figure 7.1(d), if the traveling wave flows in the clockwise 
direction. Note that this loop-based circularly polarized radiation, often expressed 
as LPB CP radiation, is distinguished from the SYN CP radiation.
This chapter presents feed antennas for CP reflectors and discusses their charac-
teristics, including the radiation pattern and beamwidth, as a function of frequency. 
The axial ratio, gain, and input performance are also discussed.
Ten sections constitute this chapter. Section 7.2 summarizes analysis methods for 
CP feed antenna design, where the method of moments (MoM) [8–10] and the finite-
difference time-domain method (FDTDM) [11, 12] are briefly described. Section 7.3 
discusses CP radiation based on the SYN CP radiation technique; transformations 
into a CP wave using a parallel plate polarizer, a conducting fin in a circular wave-
guide, and the two-point excitation of a patch, are discussed. Sections 7.4–7.10 pres-
ent CP feed antennas based on the LPB CP radiation technique, focusing on end-fire 
helical, back-fire helical, conical helical, spiral, and curl feed antennas. Note that feed 
antennas based on the LPB CP radiation technique have wideband characteristics.

Analysis Methods for CP Feed Antenna Design
The method of moments (MoM) [8–10] and the finite-difference time-domain method 
(FDTDM) [11, 12] are major analysis methods for CP feed antennas. This section 
briefly describes these two methods. Calculations for the antenna characteristics, 
including the radiation pattern, gain, and input impedance, are explained.
7.2.1	
Method of Moments (MoM)
In the MoM, the current on a conducting wire is first formulated as a field integral 
equation and then expressed as a matrix equation. A closed form for the kernel of 
the field integral equation is derived to reduce the time for calculating the matrix 
elements. Equations for calculating the antenna characteristics based on the current 
are presented next.
7.2.1.1	 Matrix Expression for an Unknown Current
Figure 7.2 shows an arbitrarily shaped wire located in free space, where the wire 
radius is assumed to be very small relative to the operating wavelength λ. The cur-
rent on the conducting wire, I(s′), is formulated by applying the boundary condition 
at the wire surface [10]:

The notations in (7.1) are as follows: ω = (2πf) is the angular frequency; ε0 is the 
permittivity in free space; s and s′ are the distances measured along the wire from its 
origin to point Q and point P (source point) on the wire, respectively; ˆ and ˆ¢
s
s  are 
the unit vectors tangential to the wire axis at points Q and P, respectively; ro,s(s, s′) 
is the distance between points P and Q; and β is the phase constant.
The current I(s′) in (7.1) is solved using the MoM. For this, first, the current is 
expanded as

Second, both sides of (7.3) are multiplied by weighting functions  
Wm(s)(m = 1, 2, …, N). Integrating the products over the wire length from SS to SE, 
we obtain the matrix equation
	
[Zmn][In] = [Vm]	
(7.5)
where [Zmn], [In], and [Vm] are called the impedance, current, and voltage matri-
ces, respectively.

From (7.5), we have [In] = [Zmn]–1[Vm]. This means that the unknown coefficients 
of the expansion functions (In: n = 1, 2, …, N) can be calculated and hence the cur-
rent I(s′) in (7.1) can be obtained.
It is recommended that a closed-form expression for en(s) be used to reduce 
the computation time. The use of piecewise sinusoidal functions for the expansion 
functions Jn, shown in Figure 7.2, lead to the following closed Nakano form [10]

impedance is straightforwardly calculated.
7.2.2	
Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method (FDTDM)
The antenna characteristics in Section 7.2.1 are derived based on the current distri-
bution. Derivation of the antenna characteristics in this subsection is based on the 
electric and magnetic fields obtained using the finite-difference time-domain method 
(FDTDM) [11, 12].
7.2.2.1	 Finite Difference
Figure 7.4 shows a situation where a feed antenna is located within a space whose vol-
ume is X × Y × Z. This space (called the analysis space) is subdivided into Nx × Ny × Nz 
cells, each having a volume of Δx × Δy × Δz. The outer surface of the analysis space 
is terminated with absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) [13–16]. To reveal the 
field distribution in the analysis space, Maxwell’s curl equations are solved. For this, 
electric field components (Ex, Ey, Ez) and magnetic field components (Hx, Hy, Hz) 
are assigned to each cell, as shown in Figure 7.5, where the coordinates (x, y, z) are 
denoted by integers (i, j, k), based on the definition (x, y, z) = (iΔx, jΔy, kΔz).
As with the spatial variables (x, y, z), a time variable t is denoted by an integer, 
n, based on the definition t = nΔt. Using these notations, the function g(x, y, z, t) and 
its derivative with respect to x are expressed as

 are similarly formulated. The solutions to Maxwell’s equations, 
E and H, are obtained by iterating (7.24) and (7.25) with n = 1,2,…, until these 
fields become constant (converge). This method is called the finite-difference time-
domain method (FDTDM).
7.2.2.3	 Post-Processing for FDTDM
The current along the antenna conductor, I(t), can be calculated by integrating the 
magnetic field obtained with the FDTDM around the antenna conductor (Ampere’s 
law). Also, note that the voltage between two points, V(t), can be calculated by taking 
the product of the electric field obtained with the FDTDM and the distance between

Polarizer and Two-Point Excitation Patch
This section presents circularly polarized (CP) feed antennas that are based on syn-
thesized CP radiation. CP horn feed antennas, each having a polarizer, and a patch 
feed antenna having two excitation points are discussed.
Our discussion starts with a polarizer composed of conducting parallel plates 
[19]. As shown in Figure 7.6, the distance between neighboring parallel plates is 
denoted as b and the length of each parallel plate in the z-direction is denoted as lz. 
The thickness of the parallel plates is assumed to be negligibly small with respect 
to the operating wavelength.

7.3	
Polarizer and Two-Point Excitation Patch
203
Consider a situation where a linearly polarized (LP) uniform plane wave (of 
wavelength λ) is incident on the polarizer, choosing distance b to be smaller than the 
wavelength λ. If the incident wave (electric field) is tilted by 45° with respect to the 
x-axis, then the x-directed electric component Ex is the same as the y-directed electric 
component Ey in both intensity and phase. Traveling through length lz, these compo-
nents experience different phase delays without affecting their amplitude. Therefore, 
it is possible to produce a 90°-phase difference between the two components Ex 
and Ey by choosing an appropriate length for lz. This means that the polarizer can 
transform the incident LP wave into a CP wave, resulting in a synthesized CP wave.
When the space between the parallel plates is filled with air, the following con-
dition is required for the polarizer to realize a CP wave:
	
2πlz/λ − 2πlz/λg = π/2	
(7.35)
where λg is the propagation wavelength for Ey within the polarizer, (7.35) is trans-
formed to

When length lz is chosen to be 3λ/4, the parameter τ is 2/3, and hence the distance b 
is given as 0.671λ [20]. Note that lz = 3λ/4 corresponds to λg/2, contributing to the 
impedance matching between the air and the polarizer. Figure 7.7 shows an applica-
tion of the polarizer to a pyramidal horn feed antenna.
Figure 7.8 also shows a horn feed antenna radiating a synthesized CP wave, 
where a conducting fin is inserted into a circular waveguide operating in the TE11 
mode [20]. The fin is rotated by 90° with respect to the x-axis. The component Ex,

which is perpendicular to the fin, is not affected when it moves past the fin. How-
ever, the fin acts as a capacitive element for the component Ey, which is parallel to 
the fin. As a result, the phase difference of the two components Ex and Ey can be 
adjusted to be 90°, that is, the incident LP wave is transformed into a CP wave by 
appropriately choosing the length of the fin. Note that the stairs in the fin are used 
to reduce the reflection of the incident LP wave.
Unlike CP horn feed antennas, a patch feed antenna has a planar structure. The 
patch shown in Figure 7.9 has two feed points, Fx and Fy. The excitation at Fx gen-
erates x-directed radiation and the excitation at Fy generates y-directed radiation. 
Therefore, by exciting these two feed points with the same amplitude and a 90° 
phase difference, a synthesized CP wave is radiated from the patch.
7.4	
One-Point Excitation CP Patch Feed Antenna
The patch shown in Figure 7.10 is excited from one point (F), differing from the 
two-point excitation patches presented in Section 7.3. Clearly, the one-point exci-
tation patch [21, 22] has a simpler structure than the two-point excitation patch.

206
Circularly Polarized Feed Antennas
Radiation of a CP wave from the one-point excitation patch is obtained using 
perturbation elements [23, 24]. Note that the area of the perturbation element is 
denoted as Δs in Figure 7.10. Also note that the excitation point F is located at a 
distance of approximately r/3 from the coordinate origin, where r (= Dpatch/2) is the 
radius of the patch, in order to achieve impedance matching to a 50-ohm feed line.
Figure 7.11 shows the radiation pattern for a one-point excitation CP patch 
designed as a feed antenna, where the ground plane has a finite size. The param-
eters used are presented in Table 7.1 [22]. The beamwidth for a 10 dB reduced field

intensity criterion, 10BW, is approximately 173° [25]. The axial ratio bandwidth for 
a 3 dB criterion is approximately 2.3%. The gain is approximately 7 dBi at f = 9.65 
GHz. The input impedance bandwidth for a VSWR = 2 criterion (corresponding to 
|S11| = 9.54 dB) is between 2 and 7%, depending on the radius of the inner conduc-
tor of a coaxial feed line.

End-Fire Helical CP Feed Antenna
Figure 7.12 shows a helical element. The notation is defined as follows: wire radius ρ, 
axial length h, diameter DHLX, pitch angle α, number of helical turns n, and ground 
plane diameter DGP. For CP end-fire radiation, the helical element must have a cir-
cumference CHLX (= πDHLX) of approximately one wavelength (1λ) [26, 27] and be 
backed by a ground plane, whose circumference CGP is larger than CHLX, that is, 
CGP/CHLX > 1.

The helical element can be thought of as an array of loops whose circumference 
is approximately one wavelength. Each loop generates loop-based CP radiation, 
which is concentrated in the positive z-space, due to the effect of the ground plane. 
End-fire CP radiation occurs as a result. Note that as the number of helical turns is 
increased, the radiation (beam) becomes sharper due to the array effect.
7.5.1	
Effects of a Cavity
For a CP feed antenna, a small number of helical turns is often recommended, because 
the antenna has a wide radiation beamwidth. Figure 7.13 shows a helical element 
with n = 2 helical turns [28], where a conducting cavity acts as the ground plane. 
Notations Dcav (= DGP), Hcav, and Δt denote the diameter, height, and thickness of 
the conducting cavity, respectively.

rion (iBW) as a function of the cavity diameter Dcav, where the cavity height and 
the operating frequency are held at Hcav = 10 mm and f =12.25 GHz (wavelength 
λ = 24.49 mm), respectively. The parameters used are summarized in Table 7.2. It is 
found that, as the cavity diameter Dcav is decreased, the beamwidth becomes wider. 
This is attributed to the fact that the region at the cavity aperture plane (at height

Hcav) where the electromagnetic field has equal or quasi-equal phase distribution 
becomes smaller.
The effect of the cavity height Hcav on the beamwidth is shown in Figure 7.15, 
where the cavity diameter and the operating frequency are held at Dcav = 28.75 mm 
and f = 12.25 GHz, respectively. Again, the parameters in Table 7.2 are used. It is 
found that, as the cavity height Hcav is decreased from 5 mm (0.2 wavelength), the 
beamwidth becomes wider.

Frequency Response
Let us investigate the frequency response of a CP helical feed antenna with a rep-
resentative cavity that uses parameters (Dcav, Hcav) = (28.75 mm, 10 mm) [29, 30].

Figure 7.16 shows the radiation patterns in the x-z plane and y-z plane. It is found 
that CP radiation is obtained around the positive z-axis across a wide frequency 
range, and the right-handed CP electric field component ER is dominant relative to 
the left-handed CP electric field component EL. Note that the helical element is not 
symmetric with respect to the element axis (the z-axis), and hence, the radiation 
pattern is not perfectly symmetric with respect to the z-axis. However, this asym-
metry is extremely small.
The frequency response of the axial ratio (AR) in the positive z-direction (θ = 0°) 
is shown in Figure 7.17. The bandwidth for a 3 dB axial ratio criterion is moderately 
wide: approximately 14.8% (from 11.3–13.1 GHz). The front-to-back ratio (F/B 
ratio) for the radiation pattern is illustrated in Figure 7.18, where a maximum field 
intensity between angles θ = 180° − 60° and θ = 180° + 60° is used as a backward 
radiation field. It is found that the F/B ratio is large, as desired: greater than 20 dB 
from 11–13 GHz.
Figure 7.19 shows the frequency response of the beamwidth for an i-dB reduced 
field intensity criterion (iBW; i = 3, 6, and 10). It is found that the difference between 
iBWs in the x-z and y-z planes is small at each frequency. As the frequency is increased, 
iBW decreases; across a 3 dB axial ratio bandwidth (14.8% from 11.3–13.1 GHz), 
the reduction for 3BW is 6.6° in the x-z plane and 9.1° in the y-z plane.
The helical element is a nonresonant element and hence it is expected that the 
input impedance will have a wideband characteristic. Figure 7.20 shows the frequency 
response of the input impedance Zin(= Rin + jXin). As expected, the variation in the

input impedance is small. Across the axial ratio bandwidth (14.8% from 11.3–13.1 
GHz), variation in the resistive component is ΔRin = 8.1Ω and variation in the reac-
tive component is ΔXin = 8.3Ω. This small variation in the input impedance, together 
with the small variation in the beam width, contributes to the wideband characteristic 
of the gain. Figure 7.21, which shows the frequency response of the gain, confirms 
this. Note that GR is the available gain for the co-polarized component ER relative 
to an isotropic antenna.

We further investigate a situation where a dielectric layer of relative permittivity 
εr = 2.1 (Teflon) covers the top surface of the cavity to protect the helical element 
Figure 7.22. The investigation reveals that the effects of the dielectric layer thickness 
B on the antenna characteristics are small, as long as B is less than 0.04 wavelength. 
Note that when a thicker dielectric layer is used, the antenna configuration param-
eters must be reconsidered to obtain CP radiation.

An array of helical elements can also be used as a CP feed antenna for a reflector. 
Figure 7.23 shows a feed antenna composed of CP helical elements. The straight line 
(StL) connected to each helical element (of diameter DHLX, pitch angle α, and num-
ber of helical turns n) is inserted into a circular cavity of diameter Dcav and height 
Hcav [31–33]. The spacing between the top and bottom conducting plates of the 
cavity is designated as Hcav. The array is excited by a probe located at the center of 
the bottom conducting plate [34]. The power input to the cavity through the probe 
electrically couples to the straight lines (StLs) connected to the helical elements and 
is radiated into free space by the elements. The StLs are coupled to the center probe 
through air (not rigid transmission lines), and hence the loss encountered in feed 
systems using wires, microstrips, or coaxial cables is avoided.
The radiation pattern is controlled by array techniques, where the excitation 
amplitude of each helical element is adjusted by the StL length and the excitation 
phase is adjusted by rotating the helical element around its axis (StL).
Figure 7.24 shows a helical array feed antenna with a two-layer structure, 
with each layer having a circular cavity. The upper layer feed antenna is used for 
Figure 7.22  Dielectric layer on top of a cavity.

frequency band. An application example of the two-layer feed antenna is found in 
Mimaki, Nakano, and Kasuga [35], and Kasuga, Mimaki, and Nakano [36], where 
an S-band feed antenna (2.1–2.6 GHz) and an X-band feed antenna (8.1–8.9 GHz) 
are designed for a Cassegrain reflector (Figure 7.25). Figure 7.26 shows the radia-
tion from these feed antennas, where a beam width of 22° for a 7 dB reduced field 
intensity criterion is realized, meeting the requirement for both of the feed antennas. 
The parameters used for these feed antennas are summarized in Tables 7.3 and 7.4.

The element shown in Figure 7.27 is a modified version of the end-fire helical element 
shown in Figure 7.12 and is called a conical helical (ConHLX) element [37–42]. 
The ConHLX element on a conducting ground plane of diameter DGP is specified 
by flare angle θ0, number of helical turns n, pitch angle α, wire radius ρ, and initial 
helical radius r0. Due to the flared structure, the current from the feed point toward 
the arm end decays smoothly, helping to reduce the cross-polarized radiation.
The radiation from the ConHLX is categorized as loop-based CP radiation. This 
section summarizes the antenna characteristics for two representative ConHLXs 
[42]; one has a long structure specified by parameters in Table 7.5 and the other has 
a short structure specified by parameters in Table 7.6.

Figures 7.28–7.33 show the frequency response for the antenna characteristics 
of the long ConHLX (Table 7.5), including the radiation pattern, axial ratio, beam 
width, F/B ratio, gain, and input impedance. It is found that the frequency band-
width for a 3 dB axial ratio (AR) criterion is approximately 35%, and the available 
gain for the co-polarized component across this AR bandwidth is more than 11 dBi.

The antenna characteristics of the short ConHLX (Table 7.6) are shown in

the long ConHLX. The available gain for the co-polarized component across an 
AR bandwidth of approximately 19% is less than 10 dBi. Note that, because of the 
wide beam width of the single short ConHLX elements, arraying these elements 
facilitates the formation of the beam required for the Cassegrain CP feed antenna.

Back-Fire-Mode CP Helical Feed Antenna
One aspect of reflector antenna design is minimization of the blockage of the trans-
mitting/receiving signals by the feed antenna to increase the aperture efficiency. Fig-
ure 7.41(a) illustrates a reflector antenna fed by a CP helical element operating in 
end-fire mode. As the ground plane (GP) for this helical CP element becomes larger, 
the blockage of the transmitting/receiving signals increases, reducing the aperture 
efficiency. However, this issue is solved by replacing the end-fire helical CP element 
with a back-fire-mode helical CP element having a small ground plane [7, 43, and 44].
7.8.1	
Back-Fire Radiation
We start by investigating how a helical element with a GP forms back-fire-mode 
radiation. Figure 7.42 shows the current (I = Ir + jIi) flowing along the helical arm, 
with the GP diameter DGP as a parameter, and where the helix has a circumference 
CHLX = π DHLX = 1λ (λ is the free-space wavelength at frequency f ), pitch angle 
α = 12.5°, number of helical turns n = 7, initial height Δh = 0.06λ, and wire radius 
ρ = 0.012λ.
When the GP diameter DGP is larger than the helical element diameter DHLX 
(DGP/DHLX = 1.89), the current flowing out from feed point F decays rapidly and 
is minimum at point P, as seen from Figure 7.42(a). This current from point F to 
Figure 7.40  Input impedance of a short conical helical feed antenna.

228

point P is called the C-current. The remaining current after point P travels with a 
relatively constant amplitude, except at the arm end region. This current is called 
the S-current, to distinguish it from the C-current. Calculation using all the currents 
flowing along the helical arm and GP reveals that the radiation field has a maximum 
intensity in the positive z-direction, that is, a helix forms end-fire radiation.
Figure 7.42(b) shows the current distribution when the GP diameter is slightly 
larger than the helical element diameter (DGP/DHLX = 1.10). C- and S-currents flow 
along the helical arm on their respective side of point P and the radiation has a 
bidirectional characteristic, with almost the same field intensity in both the positive 
and negative z-directions.
An interesting phenomenon occurs when the GP diameter is slightly smaller than 
the helical element diameter. As shown in Figure 7.42(c), where DGP/DHLX = 0.91,

plane, and (b) reduced feed blockage using a back-fire-mode CP helical feed antenna with a small

the current decays gradually from input point F and dies out at the arm end, that 
is, it forms a C-current but does not form an S-current. The radiation in this situa-
tion is directed in the negative z-direction, meaning, the helix forms back-fire-mode 
radiation. This reveals that the C-current is the source of the back-fire radiation. A 
detailed discussion on the C-current and S-current are found in Nakano [27].

7.8.2	
Frequency Response of the Current
The previous section focused on the GP size for a helical CP element, and it is revealed 
that, when the GP diameter is slightly smaller than the helical element diameter, 
the helical element operates in back-fire mode. The back-fire-mode helical CP feed 
antenna has the advantage that it reduces feed blockage of the transmitting/receiv-
ing signals due to its small GP.
This section focuses on the frequency response of the current along the helical 
arm, where the GP diameter DGP is slightly smaller than the helical diameter DHLX. 
The parameters used are as follows: DGP = 7.25 mm, DHLX = 7.96 mm [CHLX = π 
DHLX = 25 mm, which corresponds to one wavelength (1λ12) at 12 GHz], helical turns 
n = 7, wire radius ρ = 0.3 mm, initial height Δh = 1.5 mm, and pitch angle α = 14°.
As seen in Figure 7.43, a traveling wave current with gradual attenuation is 
dominant at 10 GHz and 11 GHz. As the frequency decreases from 10 GHz, varia-
tion in the amplitude of the current becomes considerable. This means that the in-
coming current from the arm end to the feed point has become larger, producing 
undesirable cross-polarized radiation (i.e., CP radiation whose rotational sense [RtS] 
is opposite to the RtS of the CP radiation due to the current flowing from the feed

point to the arm end). The cross-polarized radiation deteriorates the axial ratio, and 
hence the axial ratio becomes one factor in determining the lower frequency bound 
for the CP feed antenna.
Conversely, as the frequency is increased, an S-current becomes noticeable, 
increasing the forward-fire radiation. This results in an undesirable increase in the 
F/B ratio. Note that the inverse of the F/B ratio (i.e., the B/F ratio) should be large 
for back-fire radiation. In this context, the F/B ratio becomes one factor in determin-
ing the upper frequency bound of the CP feed antenna.
7.8.3	
Effects of Pitch Angle on the Frequency Response of the  
Antenna Characteristics
Next, we investigate the effects of the pitch angle α on the antenna characteristics. 
For this, the pitch angle is varied from 6–18°. Other configuration parameters, 
including DHLX, DGP, n, and ρ, are chosen to be the same as those used in Section 
7.8.2 (see Table 7.7).
The sense of the co-polarized CP radiation in the negative z-space is left-handed. 
Figure 7.44 shows the frequency response of the beamwidth for each i-dB reduced 
field intensity criterion, iBW, for the left-handed radiation field component EL, with 
the pitch angle α as a parameter: 3BW in Figure 7.44(a), 6BW in Figure 7.44(b), 
and 10BW in Figure 7.44(c). It is found that, as the frequency decreases, the beam-
width for each iBW decreases. It is also found that a larger pitch angle α leads to 
a wider iBW.
A representative radiation pattern is shown in Figure 7.45, where a pitch angle 
of α = 14° is used. It is revealed that the co-polarized component in the negative 
z-space, EL, is almost symmetrical with respect to the antenna axis (z-axis). It is also 
revealed that the EL pattern forms a unidirectional beam without large side lobes in 
the negative z-space, as desired for a feed antenna.
As shown in Figure 7.45, the back-fire radiation for α = 14° is large relative to 
the front-fire radiation. This holds true for other pitch angles. More detail is shown 
in Figure 7.46, where the frequency response of the F/B ratio is illustrated, with 
the pitch angle α as a parameter. It is found that a minimum F/B ratio of less than 
−20 dB is obtained for each pitch angle. It is also found that the frequency region 
exhibiting a desirably small F/B ratio shifts toward the lower frequency band as the 
pitch angle α is increased.

Figure 7.47 shows the frequency response of the axial ratio (AR) in the negative 
z-direction, with the pitch angle α as a parameter. As observed for the F/B ratio, the 
frequency region with a desirably small axial-ratio shifts toward the lower frequency 
band as the pitch angle α is increased. Note that as the pitch angle is increased, the 
bandwidth for a 3 dB axial ratio criterion becomes wider.
As long as the current does not return from the arm end toward the feed point 
F, the input impedance remains unchanged. It is expected that a current composed 
of only the C-current would create this condition for the input impedance, because 
it is a decaying traveling wave current, as seen in Figures 7.42 and 7.43. Figure 7.48 
shows the frequency response of the input impedance Zin = Rin + jXin, with the pitch 
angle α as a parameter. It is found that there is a wide frequency region where the 
input impedance is nearly constant; the resistive part Rin is approximately 100 ohms 
and the reactive part Xin is approximately zero. These values produce an acceptable 
VSWR of approximately 2 for a 50-ohm feed line. Note that the VSWR can be fur-
ther reduced by changing the initial height Δh.
Figure 7.49 shows the frequency response of the gain (available gain GL for the 
co-polarized component EL, not including mismatch with the feed line), with the 
pitch angle α as a parameter. It is found that, as the frequency increases, the gain 
reaches a maximum value and then gradually decreases, that is, the gain shows a 
wideband characteristic. The frequency region where the gain remains relatively con-
stant shifts toward the lower frequency band as the pitch angle α is increased and 
coincides with the frequency regions for desirable F/B ratio and input impedance.

broadcasting satellite receiving antenna in Japan. The distance from the GP to the 
phase center [45] of the co-polarized radiation field component EL, sLH, is calculated 
for α = 18° and presented in Figure 7.51. Strictly speaking, the calculated distance 
sLH in the x-z plane shows a different value from that in the y-z plane. Therefore, the 
distance sLH in Figure 7.51 is expressed as the average of the x-z plane and y-z plane 
values. It is found that, as the frequency increases, the phase center moves toward 
the ground plane. This is attributed to the fact that the attenuation in the current 
becomes larger as the frequency increases, as shown in Figure 7.43. As a result, the 
current contributing to the radiation concentrates in a region close to the GP.
7.9	
Spiral CP Feed Antenna
Figure 7.52 shows a two-arm spiral element in air, whose antenna circumference 
CSP is approximated to be 2πrmax, where rmax is the maximum radius. The antenna 
is excited from its center point. CP radiation from the spiral is obtained when the 
circumference of the spiral CSP is greater than one guided wavelength (1λg) and the 
currents along the spiral arms flow in a traveling wave fashion. This CP radiation 
is categorized as loop-based CP (LPB-CP) radiation [46].
Figure 7.51  Phase center of the radiation field component EL.

238
Circularly Polarized Feed Antennas
The CP radiation is bidirectional; the maximum radiation occurs in the two 
directions normal to the antenna plane (positive and negative z-directions). When 
a CP feed antenna is used for a reflector, this bidirectional radiation is transformed 
into unidirectional radiation. One technique to obtain unidirectional radiation in 
the positive z-direction is to place a flat conducting plate behind the spiral, as shown 
in Figure 7.53 [47].
Figure 7.52  Spiral element in air.

conducting plate.

Spiral CP Feed Antenna

Waves radiated from the spiral in the negative z-direction are reflected at the 
conducting plate and travel in the positive z-direction (we call these waves cavity-
reflected waves). When the distance between the conducting plate and the spiral, 
Hplate, is chosen to be one-quarter wavelength (λ/4) at the design center frequency, the 
waves that directly radiate from the spiral in the positive z-direction and the cavity-
reflected waves add in phase in front of the spiral, forming a unidirectional beam.
A conducting cavity (of height Hcav), as shown in Figure 7.54, can also be used to 
form unidirectional radiation. It is found that, as the cavity height Hcav is decreased, 
the AR deteriorates; it is difficult to obtain an AR of less than 3 dB at a cavity height 
Hcav of less than λ/10. The AR deterioration is attributed to the strong influence of 
the cavity-reflected waves upon the current flowing on the spiral arms; the cavity-
reflected waves interfere with the outgoing currents from the feed points to the arm 
ends, generating incoming currents toward the input terminals. These incoming cur-
rents radiate CP waves whose RtS is opposite to the RtS for the CP wave generated 
by the outgoing currents, resulting in a deterioration in the AR.
To mitigate the deterioration in the AR, an electromagnetic absorbing material 
(EM absorber [48–50] or resistor [51]) is used. Figure 7.55 shows a cavity-backed 
spiral feed having an EM absorber. In Figure 7.55(a), the absorber (ABS) entirely fills 
the space behind the spiral arms, while the absorber in Figure 7.55(b) fills only the 
space behind the outer region of the spiral arms (the absorber is called a ring-shaped

absorbing strip) [49, 50]. Note that the radiation efficiency for the spiral in Figure 
7.55(a) does not exceed 50%; whereas the radiation efficiency for the spiral in Fig-
ure 7.55(b) can exceed 50%. However, the former is preferable to the latter in terms 
of the frequency response of the beamwidth; the former has a smaller variation in 
the beamwidth [52].
In the following paragraphs, our discussion focuses only on the spiral CP feed 
antenna shown in Figure 7.55(a). It is assumed that the thickness of the cavity con-
ductor is negligibly small relative to the operating wavelength.
The radial distance from the translated origin o′ (above the coordinate origin 
o) to a point on the center line of the spiral strip arm (the arm having width w) is 
defined using the Archimedean function r = aϕ′ for one arm and r = a(ϕ′ + π) for 
the other arm, where a is the spiral growth rate (spiral constant) and ϕ′ is the wind-
ing angle starting at ϕst and ending at ϕend. The absorber placed behind the arms is 
a nonconducting dielectric material: model ISFA with relative permeability μr = 1, 
produced by TDK Corporation. Across the design frequency range of 3–9 GHz, the 
real part of relative permittivity of the ISFA varies from ε′ = 2.00(= 1.90 + 0.10) to 
1.78(= 1.90 − 0.12) and the dielectric loss varies from tan δ = 0.75(= 0.50 + 0.25) to 
0.41(= 0.50 − 0.09). The configuration parameters used are summarized in Table 7.8.
Figure 7.56 shows the frequency response of the radiation pattern [52]. The 
radiation pattern is symmetric with respect to the antenna axis (z-axis) due to the 
structural symmetry with respect to the z-axis. As shown in Figure 7.57, the beam 
width varies smoothly with the change in frequency; the variation in the 3BW (beam-
width for a 3 dB reduced radiation field intensity criterion) is small across the octave 
from 4–8 GHz (approximately 15°).The radiation pattern has a desirably large F/B 
ratio across the same octave range, as shown in Figure 7.58, where the F/B ratio is 
larger than 16 dB.
Figure 7.59 shows more detail for the frequency response of the AR. The radiated 
wave is circularly polarized with an AR of less than 3 dB. For comparison, the AR 
when the absorber is removed is also presented. The absorber markedly mitigates 
the deterioration in the AR, particularly within the lower frequency band.
The absorber also contributes to mitigating the variation in the input imped-
ance Zin = Rin + jXin. Figure 7.60 shows the input impedance with and without the 
absorber. The absorber leads to less variation in the input impedance, particularly 
within the lower frequency band, as is seen for the axial ratio. Note that the spiral

feed antenna does not have a self-complementary input impedance (60π ohms) [53, 
54] due to the presence of the cavity; it has a relatively constant value of less than 
60π ohms. Also note that impedance matching to a 50-ohm coaxial feed line is 
achieved using a balun circuit [55–57].
Figure 7.61 shows the gain, where GR denotes the available gain for the co-
polarized component ER relative to an isotropic CP antenna. Note that the GR does 
not include the effect of input impedance mismatch but includes the effect of the 
absorber. The low gain at lower frequencies can be explained as follows. As the 
frequency decreases, absorption of undesirable incoming currents by the absorber 
increases; this means that the ratio of the undesirable power (not used for radiation) 
to the power input to the antenna increases, resulting in a low gain.
7.10	 Curl CP Feed Antenna
The curl element shown in Figure 7.62 [58–62] is a simplified version of the spiral 
element described in Section 7.9. The arm is composed of only one arm (of wire 
radius ρ) and wound with a small number of turns. As with the spiral element, the 
radial distance from the translated origin o′ (just above the coordinate origin o) 
to a point on the horizontal curl wire section is defined as r = aϕ′, where a and o′ 
(ϕst ≤ ϕ′ ≤ ϕend) are called the curl constant and winding angle, respectively.
The circumference of the curl is defined by CCURL = 2πrmax = πDCURL and cho-
sen to be more than one guided wavelength (1λg) but less than 2λg for CP radia-
tion, where rmax is the maximum radial distance of the horizontal curl wire section. 
The antenna height (the height of the horizontal curl wire section above the GP) is 
denoted as h. The bottom end of the vertical straight wire section is excited from a 
coaxial feed line.
7.10.1	 CP Radiation
Consider a situation where the current flows in one direction along the curl wire 
from the translated origin o′ to the arm end (out-going current); there is no backward

(reflected) current flowing from the arm end to the translated origin o′ (there is no 
incoming current). A point on the curl near a loop (illustrated by the dotted line in 
Figure 7.63(a)) is denoted as A, where the loop has a circumference of one guided 
wavelength (1λg), and the current at point A has an amplitude maximum and is 
expressed as a vector that is directed in the arm winding direction. This vector is 
called the vector current.
Another amplitude maximum is observed at a different point on the curl, near 
the loop of circumference 1λg; the point is denoted as point B, as shown in Figure

7.63(b), where the distance between points A and B along the curl wire is one-half 
the guided wavelength (180° in terms of phase). When points A and B are very close 
to the loop, the points are nearly symmetric with respect to the translated origin o′. 
Then, the vector current at point B is directed in almost the same direction as the 
vector current at point A; these two vector currents are spatially in-phase. It follows 
that the resulting radiation field from the two vector currents becomes maximal in 
the z-direction, and the polarization coincides with the direction of the two vector 
currents. The in-phase vector currents rotate along the 1λg-loop with time, and hence 
the radiation field rotates. Thus, a CP wave is generated in the z-direction. Based on 
this fact, the curl is categorized as an LPB-CP element.

conducting cavity of diameter Dcav, height Hcav, and thickness Δt (Figure 7.64). The

[62]. As in the end-fire helical feed antenna with a cavity, the beamwidth decreases 
with increasing cavity diameter Dcav. When Dcav is increased from Dcav = 28–32 mm, 
the decrease in the beam width for a 10 dB reduced field intensity criterion (10BW) 
is more than 20°.
A similar investigation is performed by changing the variable from the cavity 
diameter Dcav to the cavity height Hcav. Figure 7.66 shows the beamwidth as a func-
tion of the cavity height Hcav, where the cavity diameter Dcav is held at Dcav = 30 
mm and a frequency of 12.2 GHz is used. Variation in the beamwidth is found to 
be relatively small at cavity heights of greater than 8 mm (0.33 wavelength).

This section presents the frequency response of a representative curl feed antenna, 
where the configuration parameters shown in Table 7.9 are used. The cavity diameter 
and height are held at Dcav = 30 mm and Hcav = 10 mm, respectively.
Figure 7.67 shows the frequency response of the radiation pattern. The radiation 
around the z-axis is circularly polarized, with a small cross-polarized component. 
The radiation pattern of ER is almost symmetric with respect to the z-axis, and the 
radiation in the negative z-direction is negligibly small. These findings are shown in 
greater detail in Figures 7.68 and 7.70.

As seen from Figure 7.68, the frequency bandwidth for a 3 dB AR criterion is 
approximately 7%. Across this AR bandwidth, the difference in the beam width for 
a 10 dB reduced field intensity criterion (10BW) is small (less than 14°), as shown 
in Figure 7.69. Figure 7.70 reveals that the F/B ratio is more than 20 dB within the 
same axial ratio bandwidth.

Analysis reveals that the current along the arm exhibits a nonresonant charac-
teristic, that is, the out-going current is dominant compared to the incoming current, 
forming a traveling wave current distribution with decay. This leads to a wideband 
characteristic for the input impedance. Figure 7.71 confirms this conclusion. The 
gain also shows a wideband characteristic due to those of the input impedance and 
radiation pattern. Figure 7.72 shows the available gain GR for the co-polarized 
radiation field ER.

Introduction
Historically, reflector antennas have been used for generating high gains. In this 
respect, they are unique since they offer many advantages over other high-gain 
antennas in geometrical and design simplicity, durability, and cost. The latter two 
are especially important as they influence the total cost (i.e. the costs of installation, 
operation, and maintenance). In addition, with increasing size, the cost per dB gain 
of reflector antennas improves in comparison to other antennas. As a result, practi-
cally all high-gain antennas in radio astronomy and deep space communications, 
where very high gains are required, are of reflector types. However, generating high 
gain is only one of the functions that reflector antennas can perform. As a focusing 
device, they can perform other functions as well. To understand them, one must 
note that a reflector antenna does not function alone and in isolation; it functions 
in conjunction with its feed or another reflector. With a single reflector, such as in 
prime focus reflectors, the responsibility for the reflector function transfers to its feed, 
which illuminates the reflector in its transmission mode or receives the signal in its 
reception mode. Therefore, the reflector feed is the key design feature for controlling 
the reflector function. In this chapter, we discuss two such functions, the polariza-
tion control and the formation of adaptive virtual arrays using a parabolic reflector.
The problem of investigating reflector antennas is simplified significantly by using 
the aperture antenna concepts, which can relate its aperture fields to the radiated far 
field. Further simplification is also possible by relating the reflector aperture field to 
its focal plane field [1, 2]. While the former helps in determining the radiation field 
of the reflector, the latter helps in designing the feed and thus the reflector antenna 
system. Using the matched feed concept [3], the aperture field of the feed must match 
the desired focal plane field. In this section, we use this concept to describe the 
reflector functions and the type of feeds that can help in performing such functions.
Mathematically, the focal plane field of the reflector extends to infinity. However, 
the focusing property of the reflector confines most of the energy to the vicinity of 
its focal point, where the feed will be located. From the practical point of view, the 

258
Asymmetric Reflector Feeds for Polarization Control and Adaptive Virtual Array Design
feed must also be small to reduce the reflector aperture blockage. We therefore need 
to know the focal plane field in a limited extent about the focal point. This simplifies 
the problem significantly, since in this limited range we can express the focal plane 
field in terms of a simple orthogonal set of appropriate functions. For convenience, 
we select the Fourier series and write the focal plane fields as

where A represents a field vector, E or H, and the subscript i refers to one of its rect-
angular components x or y, and ani (ρ) is the radial dependent part of the focal plane 
field. To transfer this set of functions to practical feeds we note that the most common 
reflector feeds are based on waveguide feed horn antennas. Thus, the aperture field 
of feed can be expressed in terms of the TE and TM waveguide modes, leading to

which means the azimuthal modes dominate the field in small focal region and thus 
the feed design. As practical examples, we consider the first four possibilities, and 
find the focal region field as:

This example is the case of conventional high-gain reflector antennas, where 
small feeds for prime focus reflectors are designed using smooth wall waveguides, 
fed by the TE11 mode [3].

(8.7)
where α is a complex constant representing the mode coefficient. The feed aperture is 
therefore dominated by two waveguide modes, which can generate a variety of radia-
tion patterns for the feed by controlling the mode coefficient α. Later in this chapter 
we will show that for small values of this mode coefficient α and a phase quadrature 
between the two modes, as 90°, the feed cross polarization can be matched to the 
cross polarization of offset reflectors, thereby causing its reduction and resulting in 
a matched feed for offset reflectors. For large values of α, the feed will transfer the 
reflector to an adaptive virtual array, whose excitation and inter-element spacing 
can be controlled by the amplitude and phase of the mode coefficient α.

which is a combination of two TE and one TM modes, with a new mode coefficient 
β. This case is similar to cases (b) and (c), except that having one additional mode 
allows better control of the feed field and a better match with the focal plane field. 
Thus, in either case, of cross polarization reduction of offset reflectors or in formation 
of the virtual arrays, one will have a better reflector performance in gain, sidelobe 
levels, and cross polarization.
In designing such reflector base antennas, the feed configuration is not limited 
to horn types. Any multimode antenna having a Fourier type mode description as 
(8.1) can be used to design the feed. For instance, selecting a circular microstrip 
patch antenna as the candidate we will have

Asymmetric Reflector Feeds for Polarization Control and Adaptive Virtual Array Design
Again, for small feeds with m = 1 and small substrate heights, one can design 
the feed as appropriate summations of the TM modes as

(8.12)
Possible feed designs can be one of the following
Microstrip feed (a), with only the first TM mode
	
A = TM11	
(8.13)
Microstrip feed (b), with the first two TM modes as
	
A = TM11 + αTM21	
(8.14)
Microstrip feed (c), with two asymmetric and symmetric modes as
	
A = TM11 + αTM02	
(8.15)
Microstrip feed (d), with the first three TM modes as
	
A = TM11 + αTM21 + β TM02	
(8.16)
Obviously, this is a more restrictive case, since only TM modes can be used, which 
will result in lesser control over the reflector performance. Some applications of these 
feeds are discussed in the following sections of this chapter. Additional discussion and 
their performance on reflector antennas are in Chapter 4 of Volume 1 of this series.
8.2	
Applications of Asymmetric Feeds
Symmetric reflector antennas, such as a prime focus reflector, generally have a low 
cross polarization, the level of which decreases with the reflector size. The overall 
cross polarization of the reflector feed system is therefore controlled by the feed, 
especially in prime focus reflectors where the feed aperture is small and the cross 
polarization cancellation is difficult to achieve. Design of a feed with a low cross 
polarization becomes the main challenge. The situation is different in offset reflec-
tor antennas, where the aperture asymmetry causes an inherent cross polarization 
by the reflector itself, the level of which is dependent on the reflector offset angle  
[4, 5]. However, in all high-gain applications of reflector antennas, low cross polariza-
tions are required to reduce or eliminate the interference. Examples are the reflector 
antennas in frequency-reuse applications, where the same frequency band may be 
used in two orthogonal channels. Or beam squints in circularly polarized antennas, 
which cause misalignment of the antenna, operating simultaneously at both right- 
and left-handed circular polarizations. The next section shows that by using the 

8.2	
Applications of Asymmetric Feeds
261
asymmetric feeds of the previous section, the cross polarization of offset reflectors 
can be reduced significantly to make them competitive with symmetric reflectors, 
from the point of view of the cross polarization.
Another area of application for asymmetric feeds of the previous section is in 
the formation of multiple phase centers and design of virtual arrays. Multiple phase 
centers can replace multiple antennas and significantly reduce the complexity and 
cost. Traditionally, multiple antennas have been used in a variety of applications, such 
as radars to suppress the clutter due to stationary sources such as ground. Two or 
more identical antennas were exploited to provide multiple phase center locations. 
In such an application, all antennas must generate the same radiation patterns at 
the far-zone region [6, 7]. The drawback of this approach is the need for multiple 
antennas, which will be in fixed locations, fixing their phase center locations. With 
the asymmetric feeds of the previous section, multiple phase centers can be gener-
ated on the same aperture by using only one antenna, which greatly simplifies the 
hardware. In addition, the location of the phase centers on the reflector aperture can 
be moved electronically, making a single reflector antenna equivalent to an array 
of adaptive multiple phase centers. The use of such adaptive asymmetric feeds in 
parabolic reflector antennas opens a new window to explore the potential of such 
an economical solution. A few example cases will be discussed later in this chapter.
8.2.1	
Cross Polarization Reduction in Offset Reflector Antennas
The symmetrically cut parabolic reflectors have the major drawback that the feed 
must be located at the focal point, which partly blocks the reflector aperture. It also 
needs supporting struts that will contribute to additional aperture blockage. The 
shadowing effect will become especially important in multibeam antennas having a 
relatively large feed array. This, in turn, leads to a decrease in the gain, an increase 
in the sidelobe levels and cross polarizations, and an increase in the mutual cou-
pling between the feeds via the reflector and struts. These defects can be eliminated 
by the use of offset reflector antennas, where only a portion of the main parabo-
loid constitutes the antenna. The feed is still located at the focal point, but its axis 
must be tilted toward the center of the offset reflector. Hence, the blockage will be 
decreased or cancelled due to the asymmetrical geometry of the reflector, which is 
a major advantage. Another advantage of the offset structure is that the reaction of 
the reflector to the feed is of a very low order. Because there is no direct reflection 
back into the feed, excellent isolation between the reflector and the feed is achieved. 
Furthermore, the offset geometry provides structural advantages that may be eas-
ily deployed after launching in spacecraft antenna applications. Mechanically, the 
choice of supporting struts and means of thermal control can also be relaxed in the 
offset geometry. Finally, an offset reflector can accommodate larger focal length to 
diameter ratios while maintaining a reasonable structural rigidity and a larger feed 
array in comparison to its symmetric counterpart [8–12].
As indicated earlier, an offset reflector antenna has two drawbacks. Because of 
its geometrical asymmetry, it generates a cross polarized radiation in the plane of 
asymmetry when illuminated by a conventional linearly polarized feed. As for the 
circular polarization case, the reflector main beam generates a beam squint that is 
in the opposite direction for the right- and left-hand circular polarizations [4]. In 

262
Asymmetric Reflector Feeds for Polarization Control and Adaptive Virtual Array Design
this section, cross polarization reduction in offset reflector antennas is addressed. 
First, the classical matched feeds are discussed. Then, a simplified analytical model 
is described, which helps in further investigation of the problem and relating the 
cross polarization performance to the feed parameters.
8.2.1.1	 Backgrounds on Focal Plane Distributions and Classical Matched Feeds
The electric field distribution in the focal plane of symmetric reflector antennas was 
mathematically driven [13, 14] for large focal length parabolas. It was extended to 
offset reflector antennas by Bem [2], illuminated with a uniform incident plane wave 
parallel to the optical axis of the reflector. He showed that the focal region electric 
field distribution in an offset reflector is close to that of a symmetric parabola with 
an equivalent focal length of F′ = 2F/(1 + cosθ0), where F is the focal length of the 
symmetric parabola and θ0 is the offset angle of the offset parabola. For an incident 
wave polarized in the symmetry plane (the x-direction), the electric field compo-
nents in the focal region of offset reflector antennas, with large focal lengths, are 
expressed as [2]:

wherein u = (D/4F)(1 + cosθ0)k r2 sinθ2, D is the diameter of the projected reflec-
tor aperture, and r2, θ2, ϕ2 are the coordinates of a point in the focal plane. The 
y-component of the electric field does not vanish for nonzero values of offset angles. 
To cancel or reduce this component, it must be conjugately matched by appropri-
ate primary feeds. A contour plot of the focal plane electric field of a typical offset 
reflector is shown in Figure 8.1(a) [5]. A high cross polarization component exists 
at the asymmetry plane with the zero cross polarization at the other orthogonal

plane. To conjugately match this focal region electric field distribution, the primary 
feed must possess similar polarization response at its aperture as shown in Figure 
8.1(b), for an over-mode circular waveguide horn [5].
To prove the concept, Rudge and Adatia [5] experimentally validated the reduced 
cross polarization in offset reflector antennas through the use of a tri-mode primary 
feed. The geometry of their matched feed is shown in Figure 8.2. It was a small-flare 
angle horn with two small stepped waveguides. It generated the dominant TE11 
and the higher order TE21 and TM11 modes. As discussed in [5], the mode content 
factors depend on the offset angle θ0 and semi-angle θ*, subtended by the reflector 
rim. The measured secondary radiation patterns of the offset reflector, illuminated 
by the conventional Potter horn [15] and the tri-mode matched feed [5], are shown 
in Figure 8.3, at the plane of asymmetry, ϕ = 90° plane. The aperture sizes of both 
feeds were equal to 2.8λ. The offset reflector had a focal length of 22.7λ, θ0 = 44°, 
and θ* = 30°. The cross polarization improved by about 10 dB, shown by curve b1 
for the first experimental trial. By adjusting the mode ratios, further improvement 
was measured, as illustrated by curve b2 in Figure 8.3(b) [5].

Asymmetric Reflector Feeds for Polarization Control and Adaptive Virtual Array Design
The use of rectangular and corrugated horns was also proposed [5] as matched 
feeds. In these cases, only one extra mode is sufficient to provide the required polar-
ization distribution, to reduce the unwanted cross polarization in offset reflectors. A 
dual-mode rectangular horn, as a matched feed, was addressed by Jacobson [9]. The 
use of corrugated matched feeds for cross polarization reduction was studied in [16]. 
Also, the idea of tri-mode matched feed has been recently revisited [17, 18] for bal-
anced back-to-back reflectors with a reduced moment of inertia. As for the circular 
polarization, the main beam is squinted due to the depolarizing effects of the offset 
reflector. The same concept of matched feed is well suited for correcting this as well.
In summary, the main idea behind the matched feed is to combine with the domi-
nant mode, appropriate higher order modes with proper amplitudes and phase shifts, 
to conjugately match the electric field distribution in the focal region. To understand 
the problem well, an analytic model is described in the next section to further study 
the depolarizing properties of offset reflector antennas.
8.2.1.2	 A Simplified Analytical Model for Matched Primary Feed [19]
In this section, the polarization properties of offset reflector antennas are further 
investigated by expressing the feed radiation patterns in terms of analytic functions, 
which facilitate a more general investigation of the cross polarization reduction in 
both asymmetric and inter-cardinal planes. The model includes both first and sec-
ond order azimuthal modes, primarily the TE11 and TE21 type modes, and allows 
selection of symmetric and asymmetrical patterns, with different field tapers in the 
principal planes. It also decouples the reflector performance from that of the feed, 
thus allowing a more general investigation of the reflector antenna cross polariza-
tion and its dependence on the second mode. It will be shown that the asymmetrical 
aperture distribution of the fundamental mode in the presence of the higher TE21 
mode is sufficient to reduce the cross polarization of offset reflector antennas even 
for small F/D ratios. First, several examples for circular rim offset reflector antennas 
of different F/D ratios are presented. The results are obtained by the commercial 
software TICRA’s GRASP V.7 [20], which is based on the physical optics, geometri-
cal optics, and geometrical theory of diffraction. Elliptical-rim offset reflectors cases 
are also selected and studied to further investigate the concept. The effect of cross 
polarization reduction is studied on the sidelobe levels and aperture efficiencies of 
offset reflector antennas. With the proposed feed model, the aperture efficiency of 
the reflector antenna is improved compared with a standard Gaussian feed with the 
same edge taper.
In general, inside a circular waveguide, an infinite number of TE and TM modes 
can exist, and their radiated field can be expressed by double summations in the form:

tion properties of the nmth mode and can be functions of spherical angles θ and ϕ.

The remarkable property of the round open-ended waveguides and horns is that 
both fnm(θ,ϕ) and gnm(θ,ϕ) functions are the products of two independent functions 
of θ and ϕ, in the forms of fnm(θ,ϕ) = Fnm(θ) sin(nϕ) and gnm(θ,ϕ) = Gnm(θ) cos(nϕ), 
assuming the field is y-polarized. This allows one to control the pattern of each mode 
independently in two orthogonal angular spaces by shaping the waveguide geometry 
while maintaining its circular cross-section. The required number of modes, and their 
excitation coefficients, normally depends on the application. In addition, the coef-
ficient of each mode can be controlled by the geometry and type of the excitation 
ports, probes, or slots, and the waveguide aperture size, which can also cut off the 
unwanted higher order modes within the operating frequency band.
The modes of special interest in this study are those represented by n = 1 and 
n = 2 indices, which are led by TE11 and TE21 modes in circular waveguides. The 
first group of modes is led by the TE11 mode, the field of which for a y-polarized 
case can be written in the form

where F and G are mainly governed by the Bessel functions with the exception of 
Gnm
TM = 0, as the TM modes have no Eϕ components [8]. These equations provide 
exact expressions for the radiated field of an open-ended circular waveguide. However, 
they are not suitable for our study yet. Instead, the preceding complex summations 
can be expressed in terms of simpler sine and cosine functions over the radiation 
main beams. For instance, since the TE11 mode radiates along the waveguide axis, 
its radiated field along the main beam can be represented by cosn′θ [8], where n′ is 
an arbitrary constant and has different values in the two principal planes. The value 
of this constant can be controlled by several different ways. In a conventional wave-
guide it can be controlled by the mode excitation coefficients. However, if only the 
TE11 mode must be excited, the beam shaping, the value of the constant n′, can be 
controlled by shaping the waveguide flare profile, and/or loading it with a suitable 
dielectric material [3]. Using the same analogy, an analytical model for the TE21 lead 
modes having a null at the boresight may be expressed by [sin(2θ)cos(θ − θm)]p, where 
p plays the same role as n′, in the previous case for the n = 1 modes. Here too, the 

266
Asymmetric Reflector Feeds for Polarization Control and Adaptive Virtual Array Design
power p can be controlled by the waveguide mode excitations, or for selected TE21 
mode, by shaping the feed geometry. For the sake of generality, we will refer to these 
two cases as the TE11 type and TE21 type modes. They could refer to the radiated 
fields of profiled single-mode, or dual- (multi-) mode feeds. The simple sin(2θ) func-
tion provides a null at the boresight with the peak located at the θ = 45°. The extra 
factor of cos(θ − θm) is multiplied by sin(2θ) to move the beam peak to around the θ 
= 45°. In other words, the angle θm also depends on the aperture radius supporting 
the TE21 type mode. Therefore, assuming both mode types are polarized along the 
y-axis, the analytical model describing the combined TE11 type and TE21 type modes 
can be expressed as follows

wherein C1 and C2 are the content factors of TE11 type and TE21 type modes, respec-
tively, and can be complex numbers in general to represent both amplitude ratio 
and phase difference of these modes. In the present study, two separate coefficients 
have been selected to simplify understanding the excitation level of each mode type. 
However, mathematically one only needs the mode ratio C2/C1 to describe the feed 
function completely. Herein, the feed parameter is shown by the mode ratio C2/C1. 
The exponential terms n1, n2, and p1, p2 define the tapering function in the E- and 
H-planes. Since the second term is led by the TE21 type mode, the factor j in the 
second term of (8.21) represents a 90° phase shift and is considered in order to be 
consistent with the radiation pattern of the TE21 mode according to Silver [8]. As an 
example, the normalized amplitude patterns of both TE11 type and TE21 type modes 
are illustrated in Figure 8.4, when it is assumed that each mode type has symmetric 
patterns at the principal planes. That is, n1 = n2 = p1 = p2 = 1 and θm = 0°. The first 
term has a broadside radiation pattern, whereas the second term has a null at the 
boresight angle of θ = 0°. They correspond closely to the radiation patterns of the 
TE11 and TE21 modes.
The geometry of an offset reflector antenna with a circular-rim is shown in Figure 
8.5. The reflector is defined by the focal length F, the offset angle θ0, the half-angle 
subtended by the reflector rim θ*, the diameter of the projected aperture of the offset 
reflector D, and the offset clearance distance dc, which is the distance between the 
axis of the parent parabola and the lower edge of the reflector rim [10] as shown 
in Figure 8.5. The analytic feed described by (8.21) is located at the focal point f of 
the reflector shown in Figure 8.5(a). It is shown that with appropriate amplitude 
and phase excitation of these two type modes, the cross polarization can be reduced 
at the far-field region. As reported in [5], the TE21 mode should have −90° phase 
shift with the TE11 mode to reduce the cross polarization of the secondary pattern, 
provided an appropriate amplitude ratio, and more importantly tapering factors for 
each mode at each principal plane are determined. To conduct an investigation on 
the cross polarization, offset reflector antennas with different F/D ratios are studied 
with D = 20λ, dc = λ, where λ is the wavelength at the selected frequency of 10 GHz. 
After an extensive study, the angle θm in (8.21) was found equal to zero, the TE21

type mode should have symmetric patterns at the principal planes, and both p1 and 
p2 are equal to unity. Therefore, the remaining parameters are the exponential terms 
n1 and n2 of the TE11 type modes, and the amplitude ratio C2/C1.
Tables 8.1 and 8.2 summarize the cross polarization levels of the secondary pat-
terns of the offset reflector fed by the model given by (8.21) at the ϕ = 90° asymmetry 
plane and the diagonal ϕ = 45° plane, respectively, and compared with the single 
TE11 mode feed, C2 = 0. With the dual-mode feed model given by (8.21), the cross 
polarization component is reduced to about −47 dB even for the large offset angles, 
at both the asymmetry and ϕ = 45° planes. Moreover, the value of C2/C1 increases 
as F/D decreases, to obtain the minimum cross polarization level, at both above-
mentioned planes. This implies that a larger fraction of the TE21 type mode is needed 
to cancel the unwanted cross polarization at the far-field zone for large offset angles. 
Also, the tapering factor n2 remains constant for all values of F/D ratios, whereas

n1 varies from 2.4–2.1 as F/D changes from 1.1–0.6. As a result, more asymmetric 
patterns of the TE11 type mode are required to minimize the cross polarization for 
larger offset angles. It should be mentioned that the required phase difference between 
the TE21 and the TE11 type modes is always −90°, as explained earlier.
To conduct an investigation on the effect of tapering factors n1 and n2 on the cross 
polarization, an offset reflector antenna is selected with F/D = 0.595, D = 66.5 cm, 
dc = −6.25 cm, θ* = 41.80°, and θ0 = 32.77°. The operating frequency is 10 GHz as 
before. Figure 8.6 shows the cross polarization and sidelobe levels of the secondary 
patterns in terms of C2/C1 in both the asymmetry plane of ϕ = 90° and the ϕ = 45° 
plane. Different values of n1 and n2 are considered as n1 = n2 = 1, n1 = n2 = 2, n1 = 
2.2, n2 = 2.6, and n1 = 2.0, n2 = 3.0. The first two cases correspond to the symmet-
ric E- and H-plane patterns for the TE11 type mode, and the second and third cases 
generate asymmetric ones. As can be seen, the sidelobe levels are almost unchanged 
for different amplitude ratios of C2/C1, and it is minimum when there is stronger 
tapered distribution for the TE11 type mode, n1 = 2.0, n2 = 3.0, as expected based on 
the aperture theory. However, the cross polarization levels mainly depend on C2/C1 
and are well below −50 dB at both planes when n1 = 2.2, n2 = 2.6, and C2/C1 = 0.177.
The normalized secondary co-polar and cross-polar radiation patterns are shown 
in Figure 8.7 for the optimum case, when n1 = 2.2, n2 = 2.6 and C2/C1 = 0.177, with 
a −90° phase shift. They are also compared with a standard Gaussian feed with a 
−12 dB edge illumination. The cross polarization level of the secondary patterns is 
reduced from −25 dB, when fed by the Gaussian feed, to less than −50 dB when fed 
by the proposed tapered feed in (8.21) at both ϕ = 90° and 45° planes. The radia-
tion patterns of the primary feed are shown in Figure 8.8 for the optimized case 
of n1 = 2.2, n2 = 2.6, and C2/C1 = 0.177 with a −90° phase shift. The feed mostly

center located at the focal point of the reflector.
The effect of the proposed feed is also studied on the elliptic-rim offset reflector 
antenna shown in Figure 8.9. The focal length and dc remain similar to the example 
of circular-rim offset reflector. The minor axis, DH, is selected to be equal to the 
diameter of the circular-rim offset reflector, which is 66.5 cm. First, the major axis 
of the ellipse, D as shown in Figure 8.9, changes from DH to 90 cm, to gradually 
form an elliptical projected aperture. The resulting sidelobe levels and cross polar-
izations are shown in Figure 8.10, for the same values of n1 and n2 stated above at 
both asymmetry and inter-cardinal planes, when C2/C1 = 0.18 with a −90° phase 
shift. The sidelobe level decreases as the major axis of the ellipse increases and it is 
minimum when n1 = 2.2 and n2 = 2.6. As for the cross polarization, the same tapering 
numbers yield the minimum value of cross polarization at both ϕ-planes. They are 
less than −50 dB and −48 dB at ϕ = 90° and ϕ = 45° planes, respectively. Therefore,

it has been shown that the same tapering numbers can minimize the cross polariza-
tion of the elliptic-rim offset reflector antenna under study.
The major axis of D = 90 cm is selected to conduct a study on the sidelobe and 
cross polarization levels, in terms of the amplitude ratio C2/C1, for the same tapering 
numbers of n1 = n2 = 1, n1 = n2 = 2, n1 = 2.2, n2 = 2.6, and n1 = 2.0, n2 = 3.0 as before. 
The results are shown in Figure 8.11 at both ϕ-planes of 90° and 45°. The cross 
polarization reaches to less than −48 dB at both planes when C2/C1 = 0.18∠−90°, 
n1 = 2.2, and n2 = 2.6. The corresponding secondary patterns of this optimized case 
are depicted in Figure 8.12 and are compared with a standard Gaussian feed with a 
−12 dB edge illumination as a primary feed. The cross polarization decreases from 
almost −23 dB to about −48 dB at both planes. The feed radiation patterns are almost 
the same as the ones shown in Figure 8.8.
The performance of the offset reflector antennas with the matched primary 
feed proposed in this section was also compared with three different primary feeds: 
the tapered feed with −12 dB, the Gaussian feed with −5 dB, and the Gaussian feed 
with −12 dB edge illuminations. The results are summarized in Tables 8.3 and 8.4

for the circular- and elliptical-rim reflectors, the two examples discussed earlier as 
illustrated in Figures 8.7 and 8.12, respectively. The proposed feed provides better 
aperture efficiencies, illumination, and spill-over factors, compared with a stan-
dard Gaussian feed of −5 dB edge illumination for both circular- and elliptical-rim 
reflectors with much reduced cross polarized components and comparable sidelobe 
levels. The −5 dB edge illumination has been considered in order to make a valid 
comparison. According to Figure 8.8, the value of the primary radiation pattern at 
the half-angle subtended by the rim (θ*), which is around 40°, is approximately 5 dB 
below its value at the θ = 0°. If the standard −12 dB Gaussian feed were to be used, 
the proposed tapered feed given by (8.21) needs to provide the same edge illumina-
tion of −12 dB according to the new mode content factor and exponential terms as 
denoted in the footnote of Tables 8.3 and 8.4. The corresponding results are listed 
under columns 3 and 5 of the mentioned tables. For the circular-rim case, with the 
−12 dB tapered feed the cross polarization levels are still below −35 dB compared 
with the Gaussian feed of −12 dB edge illumination, whereas their sidelobe levels 
and efficiencies are pretty much the same. However, for the elliptic-rim case, the 
−12 dB tapered feed results in low cross polarization at only the asymmetry plane 
and lower efficiency. It should be noted that the Gaussian Feed 1 provides −5 dB at 
the θ = 41.80° and −7.35 dB edge illuminations at the θ = 51.11°, the two half-angles

Feed 2 is −8.25 dB at the θ = 41.80° and −12 dB at the θ = 51.11°.
In summary, the idea of matched feeds was further studied to reduce the cross 
polarization of offset reflector antennas in both asymmetry and inter-cardinal planes. 
The feed was modeled by analytical functions representing asymmetric primary 
patterns. Such asymmetry patterns were obtained by combining the TE11 and TE21 
type modes with a small mode ratio inside a circular waveguide feed. Consequently, 
the secondary cross polarization was minimized by adjusting the amplitude ratio 
and phase difference of the two modes and more importantly by selecting different 
tapering levels of the TE11 type mode in the principal E- and H-planes.

Asymmetric Feed Designs for Cross Polarization Reduction
In Section 8.2.1.2, simple mathematical expressions for the radiation field of the feed 
were selected to allow a complete investigation of the offset reflector performance. 
In general, the required radiation patterns of the optimum feed can be generated by 
a suitable combination of the TE and TM modes or by selecting the first two TE11 
and TE21 modes and shaping the cross-section profile of the feed, as well as loading 
it preferentially by dielectrics [3]. However, such a feed can also be designed simply 
by a proper selection of circular waveguides of different diameters and lengths, and 
exciting efficiently the TE11 and TE21 modes. They are referred as adaptive feeds based 
on their capability to generate these modes with adjustable mode content factors.
In this section, two novel dual-mode circular waveguide feeds are presented. They 
generate both TE11 and TE21 modes with a quadrature −90° phase difference in dif-
ferent amplitude ratios for cross polarization reduction in offset reflector antennas. 
Traditionally, the input impedance matching of a multimode waveguide is adversely 
affected by exciting a higher order mode. The higher order TE21 mode has a negli-
gible impact on the return losses of the proposed dual-mode feeds. The numerical 
computations for these are conducted by the finite element method, HFSS [21].
8.3.1	
Feed 1: Ring Choke Excited Circular Waveguide with Slot [22, 23]
The geometry of the feed under study is shown in Figure 8.13. It consists of a central 
round waveguide with a single longitudinal slot opening on its wall into a single 
round choke. The physical dimensions of the slot are defined by its half-angular 
opening and height, as denoted by α and h, respectively, in Figure 8.13. The desired 
modes of operation are a combination of the TE11 and TE21 modes. The radius of 
the central waveguide is designed to excite the dominant TE11 mode. The slot is 
to couple some of its energy into the higher order TE21 mode inside the choke. In 
other words, the required cross-sectional change is made through the slot, right at 
the junction of the central cylinder and the choke. The outer radius of the choke 
is selected judiciously to support only the TE21 mode and suppress all other higher 
order modes. The inner and outer radii were finalized to 13 mm and 17.7 mm, 
respectively, to meet the above-mentioned criteria at the center frequency of 8.5 
GHz. With a y-polarized wave port excitation, the antenna finds an asymmetrical 
structure, which is needed for the excitation of the TE21 mode. This structure can

now operate as a dual-mode antenna. For this antenna to work as a primary feed for 
offset reflector antennas, the phase difference between the two modes must be −90° 
[5]. Therefore, the lengths of the choke and the waveguide are selected to provide 
such a phase shift, and they are equal to 19 mm and 77.5 mm, respectively. That is, 
Lch = 19 mm and L = 77.5 mm.
To simplify understanding the contribution of each mode in the far-field region, 
especially the mode content factor, (8.21) is used to model the radiation patterns 
of the proposed dual-mode feed based on the curve-fitting method. Several studies 
were performed to investigate the effect of the slot height and its angular width on 
the mode content factor and exponential terms in the analytical model expressed 
by (8.21). It is found that the angle θm in (8.21) is equal to zero, the TE21 type mode 
should have symmetric patterns at the principal planes, and both p1 and p2 are equal 
to unity. Therefore, the remaining parameters are the exponential terms n1 and n2 of 
the TE11 type modes, and the amplitude ratio C2/C1 and (8.21) can be rewritten as

Figure 8.14(a) shows the effect of the slot height on the amplitude ratio of  
C2/C1 over the frequency range of 7.0–9.0 GHz, for a fixed value of α = 6.8°. The 
amplitude ratio increases with frequency. Also, the larger the height of the slot, the 
stronger the TE21 mode is, as expected. Similarly, the effect of angular width of the 
slot, α, is shown in Figure 8.14(b). It follows almost the same trend as explained 
for the height, except for α = 4°, where the mode content factor decreases up to 8.0 
GHz and starts increasing thereafter.

The normalized co-polar and cross-polar radiation patterns of the feed under 
study, with and without slot, are illustrated in Figure 8.15 at the operating frequency 
of 9.0 GHz. The slot size is selected as h = 14.4 mm and α = 6.8°. The co-polar pat-
terns with no slot are completely symmetric, as shown in Figure 8.15(a), with their 
main beam located at the boresight direction, whereas the main beam of the co-
polar pattern with the slot at the ϕ = 0° is scanned due to the presence of the TE21 
mode, as shown in Figure 8.15(b). In addition, the generated TE21 mode increases 
the cross polarization, the amount of which depends on the slot size, in terms of 
the percentage energy conversion to the TE21 mode through the slot. In fact, such 
an asymmetry and high cross polarization level, in the primary feed, are required 
to reduce the inherent cross polarization of the offset reflector antenna, as will be 
explained shortly.
The boresight gains of the antenna are plotted in Figure 8.16 for different slot 
sizes from 14.4–15 mm for a fixed value of α = 6.8°. The boresight gain changes 
smoothly from 8.5–10 dBi. The feed performance is therefore stable over the fre-
quency range of 7.0–9.0 GHz, and the gain change is only 1.5 dB. The effect of angu-
lar opening of the slot, α, on the gain is the same as the one shown in Figure 8.16.
The asymmetric feed, proposed in Figure 8.13, can be used as a primary feed for 
offset reflector antennas to reduce their inherent high cross polarization components. 
To verify this, the dual-mode feed with a slot height of 14.4 mm has been used as 
a primary feed to illuminate a commercial elliptic-rim offset reflector of 36" × 27" 
and F/D = 0.6 at the frequency of 9.0 GHz. The co-polar and cross-polar radia-
tion patterns at the asymmetry plane, ϕ = 90° plane, are plotted in Figure 8.17 and

compared with the case when the primary feed is a conventional single-mode circular 
waveguide with a radius of 18 mm. The cross polarization of the compound reflector 
and the feed improves by about 13 dB when the proposed dual-mode feed is used to 
illuminate the offset reflector antenna. The reflector gains, when illuminated by the 
dual-mode and single-mode feeds, are in the same order and equal to 35.45 dBi and 
35.43 dBi, corresponding to aperture efficiencies of 62.97% and 62.68%, respectively.
To verify the simulation results, a prototype of Feed 1 was built and tested. The 
antenna parameters were the same as those in Figure 8.13, with the slot length of 14.5 
mm and half-angular opening of 6.8°. A photograph of the feed is shown in Figure 
8.18. The resulting mode content factor, which is the ratio of TE21/TE11, is around 
0.15 ∠−90° at the frequency of 9.0 GHz. The measured co-polar and cross-polar 
radiation patterns of the fabricated antenna are compared with the corresponding 
simulated results at the principal planes and the operating frequency of 9.0 GHz. 
They are illustrated in Figure 8.19. They are in excellent agreement. The asymmetry 
of the co-polar pattern in ϕ = 0 plane is due to the TE21 mode and is necessary for 
reduction of the cross polarization of the offset reflectors. The boresight gain of this

antenna is near 10 dBi similar to the simulation result. The minor undulations on 
the measured data are due to small reflections from the support structure, holding 
it on the tower. Because there is no discontinuity inside the central waveguide, the 
antenna remains well matched to a standard 50Ω input. The measured and simu-
lated scattering parameters of the antenna are compared in Figure 8.20, over the 
frequency range of 8.0–9.2 GHz, which agree well. The waveguide transition, from a 
rectangular cross section to a circular one, available in the laboratory, was designed 
to work over the X-band frequency range from 8–12 GHz. Thus, the measured S11 is 
shown only for frequencies above 8 GHz. The antenna bandwidth is much wider, as 
shown by the simulated S11, exhibiting a broad 10 dB bandwidth from 7.1–9.2 GHz.

Feed 2: Stepped Circular Waveguide with Tuning Blocks [24]
The geometry of proposed feed is shown in Figure 8.21. It consists of only two 
waveguide sections. The diameter of the larger waveguide is selected as small as 
possible so that only the TE11 and TE21 modes can propagate and the latter higher 
mode can be excited efficiently. Its excitation sources are two radial blocks/screws, 
which can be placed at any arbitrary axial position. In the present design, they are 
placed on the feed aperture, to be far from the waveguide discontinuity, to cause 
maximum attenuation of the higher order modes at the junction. In this manner, 
the input waveguide port is not influenced by their presence, and the feed can be 
designed easily to be broadband. The radial excitation screws do not excite the TM 
modes efficiently [25] and the main operating modes are the TE11 and TE21 modes. 
However, a step discontinuity used in the proposed feed may excite the next higher 
order TM11 mode. This has been taken care of by selecting the appropriate aperture 
size to cut off the TM11 mode over the frequency band of interest. As a result, the 
TM11 mode ratio will be very small and its contribution on the cross polarization 
of the offset reflector is negligible. In addition, if a tri-mode feed is to illuminate an 
offset reflector to reduce its cross polarization, the TM11 mode ratio should be almost 
the same level as the TE21 mode ratio [5, 18]. The length of the larger waveguide 
is selected such that the phase difference between the two modes is −90° over the 
frequency range of interest, which is from 8.0–9.1 GHz. This frequency band was 
selected to enable experimental verification, because a waveguide transition at this 
band was available in the laboratory. The antenna dimensions can be scaled readily 
for operation at any other band. The inner and outer radii were found to be 13 and 
17.3 mm, respectively. The length of the larger waveguide was 24 mm to provide 
the required −90° phase shift between the modes, and the total antenna length and 
waveguide wall thickness were 77.5 and 2 mm, respectively. This structure can now 
operate as a dual-mode feed with different mode content ratios using tuning screws.
It should be mentioned that the two blocks shown in Figure 8.21 are identical 
and their heights and widths are fixed and equal to 2 and 3 mm, respectively. Figure 
8.22 illustrates how the amplitude ratio of C2/C1 varies as the length of the blocks 
changes from 3–5 mm, over the frequency range of 8.0–9.1 GHz. As can be seen, 
the longer the blocks, the stronger the TE21 mode is, as expected.

The results of the input impedance matching with different block lengths are 
shown in Figure 8.23, and compared with those of two other antennas, namely, the 
same antenna with no blocks present and the same geometry when the 5 mm blocks 
are placed right at the discontinuity, as in traditional designs. When blocks are at 
the aperture, their reflections have negligible effects on the S11 of the proposed dual-
mode antenna, as compared to the case when the blocks are inside the waveguide 
structure at the discontinuity, which significantly deteriorates S11 to above −10 dB, 
over the entire frequency range of interest. For the proposed antenna S11 remains 
well below −15 dB, for all block lengths, including the zero value, which implies no 
block is present.

The proposed dual-mode feed shown in Figure 8.21 is also used to illuminate 
the commercial elliptic-rim offset reflector of 36"× 27" and F/D = 0.6. The resulting 
reduced cross polarization levels versus frequency are shown in Figure 8.24 [19] at 
both the ϕ = 90° and 45° planes. They are well below −30 dB over the frequency range 
of 8.0–8.6 GHz. As an example, the secondary radiation patterns of the composite 
reflector and the proposed Feed 2 are plotted in Figure 8.25 [19] at the frequency 
of 8.3 GHz at both previously mentioned ϕ-planes. The cross polarization compo-
nents are less than −35 dB and −42 dB at the inter-cardinal and asymmetry planes, 
respectively. This can be compared with the single TE11 mode feed case when the 
cross polarization components are in the order of −22 dB.
To verify the numerical results discussed, a prototype antenna was fabricated 
and tested. A photograph of the prototype antenna is shown in Figure 8.26. The 
measured co-polar and cross polarization far-field radiation patterns are plotted in

Asymmetric Reflector Feeds for Polarization Control and Adaptive Virtual Array Design
In this section, two separate asymmetric feeds were designed and used to investi-
gate the cross polarization reduction in offset reflectors. These designs were aimed at 
using the case of Example (b), in Section 8.1, the combination of the TE11 and TE21 
modes. However, the higher order TE21 mode was not excited independently, and 
the feed performance was aimed at reducing the cross polarization. This meant the 
excitation of the TE21 mode was weak, just sufficient for cross polarization reduc-
tion. The case of strong higher order mode excitations, which leads to multiple phase 
centers at the reflector aperture, and formation of virtual arrays, is investigated in 
the next few sections.

point near the surface, into a plane wave at their second focal point at infinity. 
Interestingly, they can also be viewed as mathematical transform operators, based 
on the multiple Fourier transform and convolution operations, affecting the spatial 
distributions of their focal plane field [26], which may be carried out with signal 
processing functions. In this capacity, as shown in Section 8.1, their focal plane fields 
can be used to synthesize feeds with many desired radiation patterns, which then 
illuminate the reflector to generate aperture fields with multiple phase centers, with 
or without identical secondary reflector radiation patterns. The ability to control the 
mode excitations in the focal plane allows the control of the reflector aperture field 
and the location of the phase centers on the aperture. Thus, the reflector can be con-
verted into an equivalent of a virtual array with multiple elements, with controllable 
parameters. A case of particular interest is when the resulting aperture distributions 
are made identical, to generate identical reflector radiation patterns, and thus form 
a uniform array [26, 27]. One application of such an array is in ground moving 
target indicator (GMTI) radars to adaptively suppress the stationary clutter from 
the signal [28]. In a traditional approach, multiple identical antennas were used to 
generate identical main beams at the far-field region with physically separated phase 
center locations due to each antenna. This, of course, increases the size and cost of 
the antenna system. Instead, a smart alternative is a single reflector with multiple 
phase center locations, which is normally preferred. In the following sections, we 
briefly describe the concept and investigate two possible feed designs for such a 
system implementation. Numerical results are provided to aid in understanding the 
process. More results are provided in Chapter 4 of Volume I.
8.4.1	
The Concept Theory
In conventional applications, reflector antennas are used to generate high gains with 
low cross polarizations and low sidelobes. In this mode of operation, the reflector is 
illuminated by a feed with symmetric radiation patterns and a unique phase center 
that coincides with the reflector focal point [3, 10]. However, this need not be the 
case. A reflector antenna can also be viewed as an aperture antenna [8, 10], which 
re-radiates the feed power incident on its surface. For a symmetric reflector, the 
aperture is defined by its rim. However, in general, by neglecting the diffracted rays, 
the reflector aperture may be defined by a surface perpendicular to the reflected rays 
and bound by their cross section, regardless of the reflector geometry and direction 
of radiation. In such a case, if the aperture field distribution is symmetric, then the 
reflector phase center will be at the geometric center of its aperture. For asymmetric 
aperture field distributions, the phase center will not be at its geometric center, but 
it will be located near the peak field intensity. Its exact location will depend on the 
angular location and extent of the far-field wave front, over which the phase center 
is to be determined [3]. Herein, the reflector phase center will be determined by the 
wave fronts over an angular region around the main beam. In the following sec-
tions, the concept is applied to a symmetric paraboloid reflector antenna, since its 
geometry is symmetric and the location of its phase center, with a symmetric feed, 
is predictable (that is, it is on the reflector axis). Then, the feed radiation is made 
asymmetric by adding higher order modes, and shown that the reflector phase cen-
ter moves away from its geometric center. The simulations are carried out using the 

284
Asymmetric Reflector Feeds for Polarization Control and Adaptive Virtual Array Design
finite-element method software HFSS [21] for the feed horn and the physical optics, 
geometrical optics, and geometrical theory of diffraction software GRASP [20] for 
reflector antennas.
8.4.2	
Symmetrical-Cut Paraboloids [26]
In a symmetric reflector configuration, if the focal region field is due to a point source 
symmetric in the azimuthal direction, the reflector performs a conical transform 
generating a symmetric aperture field in azimuth and tapered radially, in accordance 
with the reflector curvature. The far field is the Fourier transform of the aperture 
field, which due to its symmetry results in a symmetric pencil beam. The main beam 
has an equivalent phase center at the physical center of the reflector aperture. A 
similar situation also holds for a vectorial field, such as that of a TE11 mode, where 
the aperture field maintains the focal field polarization, in addition to the field sym-
metry, thus retaining the far-field main beam phase center at the reflector aperture 
center. The situation is somewhat different for asymmetric fields, which can be rep-
resented by Fourier series of the azimuthal TE and TM modes, as shown in Section 
8.1. Thus, by a judicial selection of the mode coefficients of the focal region field, 
one can cause desirable aperture field asymmetries and thus co-phasal asymmetric 
reflector aperture fields. However, since the reflector transforms its co-phasal aper-
ture fields to axial far-field beams, these asymmetric aperture fields generate axial 
reflector beams, with physically different equivalent phase centers on the reflector 
aperture. The reflector aperture therefore becomes equivalent to multiple virtual 
planar arrays, centered individually at each equivalent phase center location. In 
practice, as shown in Section 8.1, one can synthesize the asymmetric focal region 
fields using azimuthal modes, employing waveguides, horns, or microstrips. Their 
analog or digital combination can simulate the virtual array that can be used as 
independent beams in signal processing algorithms. An example using TE11 and 
TE21 modes is given to generate a two-element virtual array case of Example (b) 
in Section 8.1. The array has two independent and widely separated phase centers, 
but identical far-field beams, similar to two planar arrays located centrally at the 
respective phase centers [26].
The geometry of a symmetric parabolic reflector is shown in Figure 8.29. It has 
an aperture diameter of D = 50λ and F/D = 0.375 at 10 GHz. It is assumed that the 
focal region field is due to the combination of the TE11 and TE21 modes of circular 
waveguides. The corresponding aperture field distributions are illustrated in Figure 
8.30 for different mode coefficients. When the excitation is due to the TE11 mode 
alone, Figure 8.30(a), the aperture field is symmetric as expected. For the combined 
dual-mode case, infinite possibilities can exist, but for simplicity, equal amplitudes 
for the modes are selected. As for their relative phase shifts, four different cases are 
considered: the in–phase case of TE11 + TE21, out of phase case of TE11 − TE21, and 
the two quadrature phase cases of TE11 + jTE21 and TE11 − jTE21. For the first two 
cases, the aperture field amplitudes are symmetric and identical, as shown in Fig-
ure 8.30(b). Their aperture phases are, however, asymmetric and cause main beam 
scanning at the far-field region, as depicted in Figure 8.31(a) and (b). The reflec-
tor aperture is therefore equivalent to two coincidental array elements with equal 
amplitudes and anti-symmetric phase distributions. The most interesting cases are 

8.4

the last two, with quadrature relative phases according to the third and fourth cases. 
Their resulting aperture amplitude distributions are shown in Figure 8.30(c) and (d), 
having significant field values over only one half of the aperture, to the left or right. 
These distributions are similar to the TE11 mode, but shifted to the left or right of the 
aperture center. Their far-field patterns are also similar to that of the TE11 mode, as 
shown in Figure 8.31(c), with slightly lower gains, due to the reduced aperture sizes. 
These two excitations are thus equivalent to a two-element array, having elements

occupying the left- or right-hand side of the reflector aperture. Their relative phase 
centers are therefore shifted to the left or right, near the centers of their field distri-
butions. Because they generate far-field patterns, almost identical to the TE11 mode, 
but have distinctly different phase centers, they can be used together as elements 
of a virtual array. This possibility provides an opportunity for implementation of 
algorithmic signal processing in diverse applications, such as remote sensing or 
radar image processing. In the last two cases, the mode amplitude ratio influences 
the aperture distributions and phase center displacements. The resulting gains and 
phase center displacements are shown in Figure 8.32. With equal amplitude ratios, 
a maximum phase center displacement of ±21.50 cm was achieved by changing the 
phase difference between the modes. Thus, the maximum phase center separation 
of the last two distributions is equal to 43 cm, a significant distance, without caus-
ing any grating lobe formations [26]. The results can be readily extended to offset 
reflector antenna with the combined azimuthal modes of the TE11 and TM01 modes 
[27], discussed in the following section.

Adaptive Asymmetric Feed Designs for Multiphase  
Center Applications
In Section 8.4.2, the idea of multiphase center virtual array antennas was explained. 
It was shown that a single aperture antenna, illuminated by a multimode adaptive 

8.4

feed, can provide multiphase center locations over the aperture. The idea is based 
on shifting the effective aperture illumination intensities away from the physical 
center of the aperture geometry. To this end, the primary feed must asymmetrically 
illuminate the aperture while its effective phase center location coincides with the 
focal point of the reflecting surface. Multimode feeds are the best candidates for such 
adaptive feeds. It is the aim of this section to introduce one such feed and address 
its adaptive functionality.
8.4.4	
Feed 3: Adaptive Dual-mode TE11 and TE21 Feed [29]
This feed is a dual-mode feed operating at the TE11 and TE21 modes, which is the case 
of Example (b) in Section 8.1. It consists of a circular waveguide, which is tapered 
near the aperture to meet the edge illumination requirement of the reflector. The feed 
horn with the combined TE11 and TE21 modes is expected to generate multiphase 
center locations on the reflector aperture. The geometry for the tapered dual-mode 
horn antenna is shown in Figure 8.33. The desired frequency band is 9.25–10.25 
GHz. The design consists of a main circular waveguide of diameter, Dcw = 0.864λ 
= 26.60 mm, where λ is the free-space wavelength at the center frequency of 9.75 
GHz. The circular horn of diameter Dch is separated from the main waveguide by 
a tapered section of waveguide. This tapering from the main circular waveguide to 
the circular horn permits the propagation of the additional secondary modes. The 
selection of the circular horn diameter Dch depends on the requirement that both 
TE11 and TE21 mode can propagate but the next higher order mode cannot. To 
meet the first requirement, the diameter should be larger than the cut-off diameter 
supporting the propagation of the TE21 mode, Dch > 0.972λ = 31.53 mm at the 
lowest end of the frequency band, 9.25 GHz. Similarly, the second requirement is 
that the horn diameter should not support the propagation of the zero-order mode 
Dch < 1.22λ = 40 mm at the lowest end of frequency band, 9.25 GHz. Extensive 
simulations were carried out and Dch = 34.00 mm was selected for the design. The 
total horn length was 121.50 mm. For exciting the TE21 mode inside the circular 
horn, two standard X-band waveguides are connected on the opposite direction of 
the circular waveguide in order to couple the TE21 mode only, and to reject the TE11 
mode. To ensure this, the main waveguide is excited with an X-polarized TE11 field.

modes on the phase center displacement and gain.

Asymmetric Reflector Feeds for Polarization Control and Adaptive Virtual Array Design
The simulated scattering parameters of the three ports, shown in Figure 8.33, 
are illustrated in Figure 8.34. Figure 8.34(a) shows that Port 1, which corresponds 
to the TE11 mode, is very well impedance matched at better than −30 dB. Its cou-
pling to Ports 2 and 3 are significantly low. Figure 8.34(b) shows that Ports 2 and 
3, responsible for generating TE21 mode, are very well matched near the center fre-
quency of the band but not at the band edges.
The feed shown in Figure 8.33 should be able to generate relatively pure mode 
when operating in a single-mode fashion. The corresponding primary radiation pat-
terns of the feed at each mode are depicted in Figure 8.35 at the center frequency of 
9.75 GHz. As shown in Figure 8.35(a), the feed generates symmetric patterns at its 
dominant TE11 mode, with a peak directivity of 10.40 dBi and cross polarization levels 
well below −40 dB. As for the higher order TE21 mode, Figure 8.35(b), the primary 
main beam has a null at the boresight direction, as expected. Its radiation patterns 
retain a good symmetry with cross polarization components well below −30 dB.

Now, in a dual-mode operation, the feed should be able to provide scanned main 
beam radiation patterns, at least in one of the ϕ-cut planes, in order to displace the 
phase center location of the reflector. This can be done by controlling the amplitude 
ratios of the mode with a quadrature phase difference between them. To show this, 
the mode power ratio of TE11 (0.60/0°) + TE21 (0.40/±90°) is selected. The corre-
sponding dual-mode radiation patterns of the feed are shown in Figure 8.36 at the 
center frequency of 9.75 GHz. It is evident that the main beam of the H-plane pat-
terns scans to θ = ±15°, when there is a quadrature ±90° phase difference between 
the fundamental TE11 and the higher order TE21 modes. This will, in turn, shift the 
peak intensity of the reflector aperture distribution in one plane, and the resulting 
phase center location will thus move away from the center of the aperture accordingly.
Figure 8.37(a) illustrates the secondary phase patterns of the compound reflector 
and the feed for the above-mentioned mode power ratio after moving the coordinate 
origin to the new phase center locations. The selected reflector is an offset one, which 
has an F/D of 0.377, with a width of 101 cm, a height of 66 cm, and a focal length 
of 38.10 cm. Its offset distance is −13.53 cm. The phase center location displaces to 
Y = +11.5 cm and Y = −11.5 cm, when the phase shift between the modes is −90° 
and +90°, respectively. The constant phase beamwidth is around ±4°, which covers 
the secondary main beam angular range, as shown in Figure 8.37(b). As the phase 
center of the reflector moves away from its physical center, the far-field radiation

patterns have a broadside shape and are identical, which is required for uniform 
virtual array antenna applications.
In this section, the case of Example (b) in Section 8.1 was investigated. A feed 
for operation in both TE11 and TE21 modes was designed and used in a reflector 
antenna to investigate its performance. It was shown that for equal phasing of the 
modes, the reflector aperture had a single-phase center and generated a single beam. 
For quadrature phasing of the two modes, however, two separate phase centers could 
be obtained, which translated the reflector antenna into a two-element array. Since 
this array is made by a single hardware, it is therefore a virtual array. The advantage 
of such a virtual array is in the fact that its inter-element spacing, the separation 
of the reflector phase centers, could be controlled by the mode excitation ratio, or 
simply by changing the phase shift between the modes, which is a more convenient 
approach. Note that additional phase centers can also be generated, but the details are 
omitted here for brevity. Similarly, the results can be extended to other polarizations.
8.4.5	
Feed 4: Adaptive Dual-mode TE11 and TM01 Feed [30]
In this section, another dual-mode feed is presented that generates the TE11 and 
TM01 modes inside a circular waveguide feed, which is the case of Example (c) in 
Section 8.1. The geometry of the proposed feed horn is shown in Figure 8.38(a). 
The frequency band of investigation is from 9.25 to 10.25 GHz. It consists of a 
main circular waveguide and horn. The waveguide has a diameter of 0.85λ, where 
λ is the free-space wavelength at the center frequency of 9.75 GHz. The circular 
horn diameter is 1.10λ and is separated from the waveguide by a tapered section. 
The total horn length is L = 4.03λ. The TM01 mode is excited from the bottom by 
using a symmetrically placed 50Ω N-type coaxial connector, which generates an 
axially symmetric electric field distribution. The coaxial probe’s center conductor 
is connected to a symmetric bi-cone type solid metallic configuration, as shown in 
Figure 8.38(a), and is symmetrically placed inside the circular horn. The TE11 mode 
is excited with an X-band rectangular waveguide, attached to the circular waveguide 
from the side. The return loss of the feed horn, for both TE11 and TM01 modes, is 
shown in Figure 8.38(b).

In a single-mode operation, the radiation characteristics of each mode are shown 
in Figure 8.39 at the center frequency of 9.75 GHz. Figure 8.39(a) shows symmet-
ric E- and H-plane radiation patterns for the TE11 mode with a cross polarization 
level less than −45 dB. However, the −10 dB beamwidth of the H-plane radiation 
pattern is narrower than that of E-plane. Figure 8.39(b) shows symmetric E- and 
H-plane radiation patterns for the TM01 mode with a split main beam as expected. 
Its cross polarization level is well below −35 dB. The radiation patterns for these 
modes within the band are almost invariant and hence are not shown.
Similar to Feed 3 in the preceding section, the quadrature phase shifts between 
the TE11 and TM01 modes are required in order to scan the primary main beam. The 
combined dual-mode radiation patterns of Feed 4 are shown in Figure 8.40, at the 
center frequency of 9.75 GHz, with an equal amplitude ratio for the modes and ±90° 
phase shifts between them. Figure 8.40(a) shows symmetric E-plane co-polarization 
radiation pattern for the TE11(0.50/0°) + TM01(0.50/−90°) excitation. The H-plane 
co-polarization radiation pattern undergoes a beam shift of θ = +19°. By changing 
the phase shift from −90° to +90°, the H-plane main beam scans to θ = −19°. How-
ever, the E-plane beam always stays at the broadside angle, whereas H-plane retains 
the beam shift. For clarity, in Figure 8.41, a plot of the beam shifts for different 
TE11 and TM01 mode amplitudes, in the excitation TE11(0°) + TM01(−90°), at 9.75 
GHz are shown. Increasing the TM01 mode amplitude and, consequently, decreasing 
that of the TE11 mode results in an increased beam shift angle. Thus, different beam 
shifts can be achieved by controlling the relative mode amplitudes and phase values.
The preceding case will move the reflector phase center in the ϕ = 90° plane. The 
same offset reflector antenna, explained in the preceding section, is selected to con-
duct the study for virtual array applications. The reflector performance in terms of 
the phase center displacement and gain is shown in Figure 8.42, for different power 
contents of the TE11 and TM01 modes. As the TM01 mode power content increases, 
the phase center location moves away from the origin, while the gain drops. The 
TE11 and TM01 mode combination with 50% power content in each shows a gain

of 34.10 dBi and phase center movement of Y = 11.75 cm. Also, by reversing the 
phase difference between the modes, a phase center movement in the opposite side 
will be observed.
Following the feed horn design, a prototype was fabricated and experimentally 
verified. The far-field radiation patterns of both TE11 and TM01 modes were mea-
sured in the Compact Range of the Antennas and Microwave Laboratory (AML) at 
the University of Manitoba and are shown in Figure 8.43(a) and (b), at 9.75 GHz. 
Figure 8.43(a), for the TE11 mode patterns in ϕ = 0°, 45°, and 90° planes, shows a 
symmetric broadside radiation pattern, with a gain of around 10 dBi, and −10 dB 
beamwidth of 108°. Similarly, Figure 8.43(b), for the TM01 mode, shows symmetric 
radiation patterns, with a gain of around 5 dBi and null at the broadside. Since the 
horn length is small, the side feeding waveguide for the TE11 mode could not be 
fully covered and caused scattering that resulted in small undulation in the radiation

patterns. The near-field distribution of the feed horn was also measured in the Near-
Field Chamber of the University of Manitoba for both excitations TE11(0.50/0°) + 
TM01(0.50/90°) and TE11(0.50/0°) + TM01(0.50/−90°). From the near-field data, the 
far-field amplitude contours were generated, which are shown in Figures 8.44(a) 
and (b). Figure 8.44(a), for the excitation TE11(0.50/0°) + TM01(0.50/−90°), shows 
that the far-field pattern is shifted to the left to about −20°, as expected from Figure 
8.40(a). Figure 8.44(b) for the excitation TE11(0.50/0°) + TM01(0.50/90°) provides 
a similar beam shift but toward +20°. Thus, the feed radiation patterns for excita-
tions TE11(0.50/0°) + TM01(0.50/90°) and TE11(0.50/0°) + TM01(0.50/−90°) are in 
agreement with the simulations. Again, the undulations, on the contour plots, are 
caused by scattering from the feed waveguide of the TE11 mode.
For the configuration presented, the performance of this feed, designed using 
the TE11 and TM01 modes, was very similar to that in the previous one, using the 
TE11 and TE21 modes. Of course, there are differences in their design parameters 
and performance in terms of the polarization and sidelobes. Their combination will 
result in the case of Example (d), introduced in Section 8.1, where all three modes 
will be used. Such a feed will have more parameters and offer more flexibility in

controlling the reflector and the virtual array performance. It is presented in the 
following section.
8.4.6	
Feed 5: Adaptive Triple-Mode TE11 + TM01 + TE21 Feed [31]
This case corresponds to Example (d) of Section 8.1. The simulation model of the 
circular waveguide horn antenna is shown in Figure 8.45. The horn consists of two 
corrugations or chokes at the aperture of the triple mode horn such that it can illu-
minate a symmetrical parabolic reflector antenna of F/D = 0.6 with −10 dB edge 
illumination, when considering TE11 mode alone. Three circular waveguide sections 
were used to generate TE11, TM01, and TE21 modes. Their diameters are 1.34 cm for 
the TE11 mode, 1.53 cm for the TM01 mode, and 2.10 cm for the TE21 mode. The 
total length of the horn is 24 cm with an aperture diameter of 3.8 cm. The dominant 
TE11 mode is excited in the lowest section, which is fed using a single rectangular 
waveguide port, in the y-z plane. This section is coupled to another cylinder of rela-
tively larger diameter supporting the TM01 mode and fed by using two horizontally 
orientated rectangular waveguide ports, placed spatially opposite to each other. In 
this case, the electric field in each of the rectangular waveguides will be along the 
axis of the horn. Since this mode is rotationally symmetric, the azimuthal location 
of its feeding waveguide is not important but may be selected orthogonal to the 
TE11 mode to minimize their coupling, that is, x-z plane. Another transition in the 
structure is made, from the middle section to the top most section, by another cir-
cular waveguide of even larger diameter, such that it supports the TE21 mode. This 
waveguide section too is fed by a pair of rectangular waveguide ports placed opposite 
to each other, but now the electric field in each of the rectangular waveguides are 
perpendicular to the axis of the horn. The feeding waveguides are in the same plane

as that of the TE11 mode, that is, y-z plane. By combining the TE11 mode with the 
other two, in proper amplitudes and phase, arbitrary feed beam scan can be obtained. 
Their excitation can be selected to provide the required reflector aperture distribu-
tions to form the desired virtual arrays, with most desirable far-field patterns. This 
study can be done similar to the cases of Feed 3 and Feed 4. However, since in this 
case three Fourier modes are contributing to the radiation, the resulting far fields 
can be shaped with more accuracy.
The simulated return loss of the horn for all three modes (TE11, TM01, and TE21 
modes) is shown in Figure 8.46. The TE11, TM01, and TE21 modes show impedance 
bandwidths (S11 = −10 dB) of 550 MHz, 720 MHz, and more than 1 GHz, respec-
tively. However, they show a common frequency match bandwidth from 7.48–8.00 
GHz. Their respective single-mode radiation patterns are shown in Figure 8.46(b), 
(c), and (d). Considering the symmetric characteristics of each mode, their radiation 
patterns show good isolation between the modes.
As indicated earlier, having an additional mode allows a better control of the 
phase center displacement and the reflector radiation patterns. Thus, the inter-element 
spacing of the virtual array elements and their radiation patterns can be controlled 
more accurately. The details have not been provided here.

Concluding Remarks
This chapter discussed the use of a reflector antenna with more complex feed struc-
tures. It was shown that by expanding the focal plane field of the reflector in terms 
of orthogonal modes, the reflector antenna can be converted into more interesting 
devices. The simplest case was the high-gain antenna operation, traditionally used 
in practice. The more general case resulted in single or multiple phase centers on the 
reflector aperture, which could be used for clutter suppression, cross polarization 
reduction, and virtual array formations. Example feeds for polarization control and 
phase center displacements were presented and discussed.

Introduction
This chapter covers array antennas and telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&C) 
antennas that are widely used in satellite communications. While the array anten-
nas are used by themselves or as feed arrays for reflector antennas, the low-gain 
TT&C antennas are critical components of the antenna payloads and are part 
of any communication satellite together with reflector antennas. Practical design 
aspects of array antennas and design equations are presented. TT&C antennas are 
not covered in detail in any textbook and are included here in this volume for the 
first time. Design, RF performance, and hardware pictures are provided for the 
low-gain antennas.
This chapter is divided into two separate sections, array antennas and TT&C 
antennas. Array antennas have been extensively used for remote sensing, radar, air-
craft, satellite communications, wireless, vehicular, and ground applications. The 
array antennas are very compact compared to reflector antennas but require complex 
beam-forming networks, large number of amplifiers, phase shifters, digital control 
units, and power electronics. They are attractive in applications requiring high gain, 
beam scan, beam shape reconfigurability, anti-jamming applications, and multiple 
beam capability. The advantage with arrays relative to reflectors is that they can 
provide multiple beams with a single aperture instead of multiple apertures. A num-
ber of satellite and aircraft payloads have flown array antennas at several frequency 
bands such as L-band, X-band, Ku-band, Ka-band, and EHF band on programs like 
GPS-2, WGS, Connexion, AEHF, and so on [1, 2].
The low gain TT&C antenna provides telemetry and telecommand functions 
for satellites when they are in the transfer orbit and also when the satellite is on 
orbit. During the transfer orbit, TT&C is the only communication link between the 
satellite and the ground and is very critical to proper functionality of the satellite. 
Once the satellite is on orbit, TT&C antennas provide data related to the heath of

the satellite such as thermal and power monitoring to ground on a regular basis. 
The TT&C antenna system typically comprises a bi-conical antenna providing 
a toroidal pattern shape and a wide coverage horn that has cardioidal radiation 
pattern. Combination of these two antennas provides the required coverage dur-
ing transfer orbit and during on-station. Global coverage horns are also used for 
other satellite functions such as on-orbit tests of satellite payloads and serving as 
beacons for a ground terminal.

Array Antennas
The array antennas can be classified into two categories: passive array antennas with 
fixed beam shape and phased array antennas with electronic beam scanning. Passive 
arrays employ high-level beam-forming network (BFN) to form the beam. The BFN 
is designed to provide desired amplitude and phase excitations to the array elements 
in order to shape the beam over the coverage region with required gain and side lobe 
levels. An advantage of the active phased array is that it provides beam scanning over 
the desired coverage with electronic phase shifters. Phased array also has low front-
end losses since the beam forming is implemented at low level with printed circuit 
technology (stripline or microstrip media). However, it requires a large number of 
amplifiers (LNAs or SSPAs), phase shifters, attenuators, couplers for low-level BFN, 
digital controls, heat pipes, DC power units, connectors, and harness. The two types 
of arrays are illustrated in Figures 9.1 and 9.2 for receive function. The transmit 
arrays are similar to the receive arrays except that they have SSPAs/TWTAs instead 
of LNAs. Both types can be implemented for single or multiple beams. Phased arrays 
provide beam flexibility through the use of active components.

Array Design
The array design depends on the antenna gain, beam width, and coverage require-
ments. Key design parameters are the radiating elements, lattice of the array, interele-
ment spacing, and the number of elements. The array design is common to both 
types discussed in the previous section. Element spacing depends on the maximum 
scan angle or the maximum coverage angle, lattice type, and the highest frequency 
of operation.
Two types of array lattice that are widely used are square lattice and hexagonal 
lattice [3, 4]. Square lattice for a given maximum scan angle requires more elements 
than the hexagonal lattice. Figure 9.3 shows array layouts with square and hexago-
nal lattices. The advantage with hexagonal lattice is that the element spacing can be 
increased by about 15% compared to the square lattice for identical coverage/scan 
requirements with identical worst-case grating lobe locations. The increased element 
spacing of hexagonal lattice allows decreased number of elements and simplifies the 
back-end hardware (BFNs, LNAs, filters, and so on) for identical gain as the square 
lattice. The element spacings for the two lattice types are selected in order to satisfy 
the grating lobe free condition and are given as

the highest frequency of operation. The closest grating lobes occur in the Φ = 0° 
and 90° planes for the square lattice array and in the Φ = 30° and 90° planes for 
the hexagonal lattice array. The grating lobes occur in the opposite direction of the 
beam scan. The worst-case grating lobe location θG is typically selected such that it 
is larger than θsm in order to keep the side lobe levels of the grating lobes at angular 
location −θsm at least 15 dB lower than the peak gain. Table 9.1 shows the element 
spacing required for arrays with both lattices as a function of maximum scan angle. 
The grating lobe location is assumed slightly larger than the maximum scan angle 
and could be changed based on the requirements. It shows that for satellite applica-
tions, large element spacing of about 3.6λ could be used whereas for aircraft and 
radar applications requiring about 60° scan, small element spacing of about 0.66λ 
have to be used.
9.2.1.1	 Array Design Example Using Square Lattice
A 42λ diameter array with 3λ interelement spacing is used in this example. The 
elements are arranged in a square grid layout, and the elements are arranged to fit 
close to a circular aperture shape. Circular aperture shape is preferred in most appli-
cations due to lower side lobe levels compared to a square aperture. There are 169 
elements in the array as shown in Figure 9.4. Computed array patterns for square 
lattice array are shown in Figures 9.5–9.8 for boresight and scanned beams. Figure 
9.5 shows the beam plot in the orthogonal θ, ϕ-planes showing the grating lobes for

the ϕ = 0° and ϕ = 90° and at θ = 19.4°. The directivity plot of the boresight beam 
as function of θ is shown in Figure 9.6, and the nearest grating lobe is at 19.4°. The 
grating lobe plot for the beam scanned to 9° and the corresponding directivity plot 
are shown in Figures 9.7 and 9.8, respectively. The scanned beam gain is 1.64 dB 
lower than the unscanned beam. This is the scan loss of the array, which is due to 
the element roll-off at 9° relative to peak element gain.

A 42λ × 44.57λ array with 3λ interelement spacing is used in this example. The 
elements are arranged in a hexagonal grid layout, and the elements are arranged to 
fit close to a circular aperture shape. There are 169 elements in the array as shown

in the ϕ = 0° and ϕ = 90° and occurs at 22.5° (19.4° with square lattice). The direc-
tivity plot of the boresight beam as function of θ is shown in Figure 9.11. Nearest 
grating lobe is at 22.5°. The grating lobe plot for the beam scanned to 9° and the 
corresponding directivity plot are shown in Figures 9.12 and 9.13, respectively. 
Scanned beam grating lobes are at 13.5°. The gain values are similar to the square 
array, but the advantage with the hexagonal lattice is that it allows increasing the 
element spacing by about 15% relative to the square array, which results in about 
30% saving in the number of elements.

9.2.1.3	 Number of Elements
The next design parameter is the number of elements. It depends on the minimum 
gain that the array needs to meet over the scan region. The array peak directivity at 
boresight is given by [5]:

The peak directivity Dp is in dBi and is the product of the element gain and the 
number of elements in the array. The parameters in (9.3) are the following: Ae is the 
unit cell area of the element, λl is the wavelength at the lowest frequency of opera-
tion, ηe is the element efficiency, and N is the number of elements in the array. The 
first tem on the right-hand side of (9.3) is the array factor, and the second term is 
the element directivity De. The number of elements can be calculated as

The peak directivity can be derived from the minimum gain requirement over 
the coverage region and is given as
	
Dp = Gmin + Ls + SL + GLpe + TL + X + Im	
(9.5)
where Gmin is the minimum coverage gain of the array, Ls is the antenna loss that 
includes all front-end losses (from array aperture to amplifiers), mismatch losses, 
polarization losses, and so on, SL is the scan loss, GLpe is the gain loss due to pointing 
error (satellite, aircraft, ground pointing error), TL is the illumination taper loss of 
the array in dB, X is the beam overlap loss (3–4 dB for multiple overlapping beams 
and is 0 dB if only the beam peak is the requirement), and Im is the implementa-
tion margin required for practical array antennas that include thermal effects, gain 
degradation due to amplifier failures, array excitation amplitude, and phase errors 
(typically about 0.5 dB). The scan loss depends only on the element and is given by 
the active element gain roll-off from beam peak to the maximum scan angle. The 
element roll-off for directive elements (>1.0λ typically used for satellites with small 
coverage regions or scans) is given as

θ3 = A (λh / de)	
(9.7)
In (9.7), de is the element diameter and λh is the wavelength at highest frequency 
of operation, and A is the constant, which depends on the type of radiating element. 
A is 63 for high-efficiency multimode horn, 70 for Potter horn, 58 for cup-dipole 
radiating element, 55 for dominant mode square horn, and 52 for high-efficiency 
square or rectangular horn.
The scan loss for element sizes close to 0.5λ used for large scan applications is 
given as
	
SL = 10 log10(cosnθ)	
(9.8)
The value of n varies and is typically in the range 1–1.5. For small elements a 
value of n = 1.5 in (9.8) better fits the element roll-off than the conventional cos(θ) 
roll-off for practical antennas. For example, the scan loss is 2.26 dB for a 45° scan, 
4.52 dB for a 60° scan, and 6.99 dB for a 70° scan.
9.2.1.4	 Amplitude Taper
The array amplitude taper is one of the key critical parameters impacting the gain 
and the side lobe levels. The arrays are uniformly illuminated if low side lobes are 
not required. This is due the fact that BFN is simpler, and also all the distributed 
amplifiers for transmit arrays could have uniform size SSPAs. A tapered, illumina-
tion distribution lowers the side lobe levels but broadens the beam and lowers the 
antenna efficiency. A parabolic aperture distribution over a pedestal maximizes the 
antenna efficiency for a given side lobe level and is often used in practical arrays. 
The aperture field illumination function is defined as
	
E(r) = T + (1 − T)(1 − r2)n	
(9.9)
where r is the normalized radius, T is the pedestal height at the edge of the array, 
and n is the shape factor. Edge illumination taper in dB is given as 20 log10(T). The 
higher value the shape factor gives lower efficiency. Shape factor of n = 1 is gener-
ally used in practice. The efficiency value for n = 1 as a function of pedestal height 
T is given in closed form as

(9.10)
The efficiency value η in (9.10) is in percentage value. For example, a −5 dB 
edge taper (T = 0.562) gives an efficiency values of 97.4% and a −10 dB illumina-
tion taper (T = 0.316) provides an aperture efficiency of 91.7%. Gain loss due to 
−10 dB taper is only 0.38 dB. This has to be taken into account in array sizing. The 
amplitude taper across the array for different n values is shown in Figure 9.14. The 
efficiency value for shape factor n = 1 as a function of T is shown in Figure 9.15.

Radiating Elements
The type of radiating element used for the array is the key design choice. It depends 
on several factors such as polarization, application, and percentage bandwidth, but 
the key factor is the scan/coverage requirements. For satellite applications where 
the maximum scan angle is 8.7° from boresight, the element size could be large and 
up to 3.6 wavelengths in diameter. For large scan applications, the element spacing 
is about 0.6 wavelengths or less. Antenna engineers tend to over-design arrays for 
large scan applications with spacing of 0.5 wavelengths or less, which increases the 
number of elements by 44% with significant impact on back-end electronics, which

is not required. A brief description of the elements for array antennas is given here. 
Details of the radiating elements are discussed in other chapters of this book. The 
radiating elements for array antennas are classified into the following two categories:
• Low-scan array radiating elements;
• Large-scan radiating elements.
9.2.2.1	 Low-Scan Array Radiating Elements
For low-scan array applications with scan angles of about 30°, the radiating ele-
ments suitable are waveguide type and are:
• Potter horns;
• Dominant mode circular horns;
• Multimode high-efficiency circular horns;
• Rectangular or square dominant mode horns;
• Cup-dipole radiating elements;
• Helical radiating elements.
Potter Horns
It employs TE11 and TM11 modes in order to create a tapered amplitude distribu-
tion in the E-plane of the horn. As a result, symmetric distribution is achieved in 
the two principal planes with low cross-polar levels. Minimum diameter of the horn 
required for Potter horn implementation is about 1.25λ. The half power beamwidth 
of a Potter horn is 70λ /de (de is the horn internal diameter) and has an efficiency of 
about 74%. Although Potter horns could be used for array antennas, they are not 
optimal due to the highly tapered aperture illumination. The tapered aperture illu-
mination does not combine well in an array efficiently and hence is not used often 
for array applications.
Dominant Mode Circular Horns
Dominant mode TE11 circular horns have been used for limited satellite applications. 
They are simple to fabricate and are compact in size. Although the conical horns 
have about 30% bandwidth, low cross-polar radiation is obtainable over limited 
frequency range when the aperture diameter is in the range 1.10λ to 1.15λ. Another 
disadvantage is that it produces elliptical beam with principal plane E- and H-plane 
half-power beamwidths as

 and L is the axial length of the horn from aperture to the apex

Multimode High-Efficiency Circular Horns
These horns are widely used for satellite applications due to high efficiency combined 
with low cross-polar levels. They also have an advantage of supporting dual-band 
(transmit and receive) and multiband application [6, 7]. Typical efficiency values 
range from 84–92% depending on the bandwidth. The half-power beamwidth of 
the horns vary from 60–65λ /dm depending on the efficiency. Details of the design 
and radiation characteristics of this horn are given in other chapters of this book.
Rectangular and Square Horns
Square horns are not suitable for hexagonal grid lattice, but could be used when the 
lattice angle among the three closest horns forming a triangle is changed to 63.43° 
instead of 60°, which is not optimal from the grating lobe aspect of the array design. 
Rectangular horns with an aperture aspect ratio of 0.866 can fit with the hexagonal 
lattice and are suitable for large element spacings since the cross-polar levels are 
very low. Multimode rectangular and square horns to increase the efficiency of these 
horns have been developed for array applications [8, 9].
Cup-Dipole Radiating Elements
Cup-dipole radiating elements are widely used for mobile satellites for LEO, MEO, 
and GEO applications as feeds for direct radiating array antenna or as feeds for 
large reflectors. The advantage of cup-dipoles is that they are very compact, have 
very high efficiency, and circular polarization can be generated without the need for 
polarizer. Disadvantages are narrow bandwidth limiting their use to UHF, L-band, 
and S-band arrays. The basic element comprises a crossed-dipole (CP) or a dipole 
(LP) exciting a circular cup. The cup-size is selected to support the dominant mode 
waveguide modes. The combined radiation is due to direct radiation from dipoles 
and the reflected radiation from the circular cup. The key parameters are the cup-
diameter, the dipole-to-ground spacing, which is typically in the range 0.20–0.25λ 
depending on the cup-diameter, and the cup height, which is about 0.50λ. Circular 
apertures are preferred over square cups due to better off-axis cross-polar levels. 
Conventional cup-dipoles are used for cup-sizes of 1.2λ or less. For larger cup sizes, 
a splash-plate above the cup is required to illuminate the aperture more uniformly 
to realize high efficiency. This is also called short-backfire antenna. There are two 
types of coaxial feeding for cup-dipoles: (a) Single coaxial feed with unequal dipole 
lengths, feeding a slot in the 45° plane relative to dipoles. The slot excites the two 
dipoles with equal power and the desired phase quadrature required for CP genera-
tion is obtained by using unequal length dipoles. Bandwidth of this design is lim-
ited to about 4%. (b) Equal-length dipoles with hybrid coupler for CP generation. 
It requires two coaxial lines with balun and combined with a 3 dB hybrid coupler. 
Bandwidths of about 25% can be achieved with this design.

Helical Radiating Elements
Helical radiators are used for array applications requiring single sense of circular 
polarization (LHCP or RHCP). They are used for frequencies ranging from 100 
MHz to Ku-band. The main advantages are wide bandwidths (about 50%), simple 
method for generating the circular polarization, and simpler structure allowing close 
packing of elements in the array. The helix radiator requires a ground plane for uni-
directional patterns, which are often in the shape of a shallow cup. There are three 
modes for helix: normal mode, axial mode, and conical mode, but the axial mode 
helices are widely used. The circumference of the helix normalized with wavelength 
is about 1.1 for optimal gain with pitch angle of 12.8°. The length of the helix dic-
tates the gain and is given as [10]
	
L = N. C tan (α)	
(9.14)
where C, is the circumference of the helix (πD) and α is the pitch angle. The half-
power beamwidth and the gain of the helix are given approximately as

(9.17)
Equation (9.17) ensures that the element gain does not exceed the 100% gain 
based on the interelement spacing of the array.
9.2.2.2	 Large-Scan Array Elements
For large-scan applications of 45° or larger, the element spacing is electrically small 
and is in the range 0.5–0.8λ. For larger scans, waveguide type elements are not 
suitable since they do not support waveguide modes when the element spacing is 
close to 0.5λ.
Microstrip Patch Element
Microstrip patch radiating elements are often used for wide-scan applications. 
Square, rectangular, and circular patches are often used. Advantages are low profile, 
low cost, and ease of manufacturing. The disadvantages are narrow bandwidth and 
dielectric losses. The bandwidth of a single layered patch is given as

314
Array Antennas and Low-Gain TT&C Antennas 
	
BW ≈ 128 F2T	
(9.18)
where BW is the bandwidth in MHz, F is the frequency in GHz, and T is the thickness 
of the substrate. T is typically less than 0.05λ in order to avoid the surface waves.
The feeding includes coaxial line, inset feeding, and slot feeding through the 
ground plane. The bandwidth of a single patch can be increased significantly to 
about 20% by using stacked patch configuration with a feed patch and an electro-
magnetically coupled patch on the top of the feed patch.
Slot Radiating Element
Slot radiators are also used for narrow-band applications. They are used in wave-
guides and also on dielectric boards. Both longitudinal and transverse slots have been 
used in waveguide media. Printed slots require another layer behind the ground plane 
for feeding the slots and combining them through stripline or microstrip networks. 
Details on slot radiators can be found in the literature [11].
Annular Ring-Slot Element
Annular ring etched on a microstrip substrate is a very compact radiating element 
applicable to wide-scan applications. The element is typically excited with a stripline 
or micro-stripline feed behind the ground plane [12]. This element can be used for 
single-linear, dual-linear, single-CP, or dual-CP applications. For wide-scan applica-
tions it is important to have several via holes shorts around the radiating ring and 
the feed lines. The shorted vias act like a metallic cavity preventing the higher order 
modes and surface wave propagation through the array.
Connected Element
A connected long-slot radiator, with periodic feeding by a connected dipole element 
with a ground plane in an array, has been reported by J. J. Lee et al. [13]. This ele-
ment is the lowest weight radiator reported to date and is suitable for large arrays. 
In smaller array implementation (less than 8λ × 8λ), it suffers from large mismatch 
losses. This element also requires a balun to transform the 400 ohm array imped-
ance to 50 ohm. The height of the radiator is compact and is about 0.29λc at center 
frequency. The long slot aperture is intrinsically wideband due to the fact that the 
slot elements support TEM modes with extremely low cut-off frequencies.
Flared Notch Element
The flared notch, which is also called as Vivaldi radiating element, has multi-octave 
bandwidth and wide scan capabilities [14]. It can support dual-orthogonal linear 
polarizations or dual-circular polarizations. The disadvantage with this element is 
that it is not compact and is typically 0.50–0.75λc. Another disadvantage with this 
element is that it has high cross-polar levels in the nonprincipal planes of the ele-
ment pattern.
Ridged Waveguide Element
Ridged waveguide elements are more compact than the flared notch elements. It is 
capable of operating over a wide frequency bandwidth ratio of greater than 4:1 and 
scan capability of about +/–45°. The H-plane dimension of the element restricts the 

9.2

scan capability due to appearance of grating lobes and limiting the low-frequency 
operation. By removing the sidewalls of the ridged waveguide, the cut-off frequency 
of the fundamental quasi-TEM mode, as well as the cut-off frequencies of the higher 
order modes, are significantly reduced, extending the bandwidth capability of this 
element. This element when used in an array results in a ridged parallel plate wave-
guide array [15, 16]. This element supports dual polarization when placed in an 
egg-crate structure with square lattice where top and bottom parallel plates are cut 
out to form the ridges of the element, as shown in Figure 9.16. Typical cross-polar 
levels of better than −15 dB (relative to peak co-polar gain) and VSWR of better 
than 2:1 are reported over +/–45° scan with this element in large arrays.
9.2.3	
Array Radiation Patterns
The radiation properties of the arrays can be analyzed by several methods. The key 
parameter is the embedded or sometimes called an active element pattern. The finite-
element method (FEM) can be used to characterize the element radiation in an array. 
FEM is a numerical procedure to obtain approximate solutions to boundary-value 
problems of mathematical physics. FEM is recognized as a generic method appli-
cable to a wide variety of engineering and mathematical problems, including those 
in antenna and microwave engineering. A few examples of the successful commercial 
software packages based on FEM are HFSS, CST, and FEKO.
9.2.3.1	 Infinite Array Modeling Using FEM in the Frequency Domain
An infinitely periodic structure with a uniform progressively phased excitation 
enables the numerical analysis to be confined to a single array element, or a unit 
cell. The standard FEM discretization is then applied to the defined unit cell. On the 
Figure 9.16  Ridged waveguide element array in an egg-crate structure for UWB applications 
[15].

316
Array Antennas and Low-Gain TT&C Antennas 
boundaries of the unit cell, proper boundary conditions are imposed to correctly 
model the field behavior on both the periodic and radiation boundaries. When a 
phased array is analyzed in the frequency domain, each antenna element is excited 
by an individual source with a specific phase difference relative to the other sources, 
which results in a main beam being radiated in a desired direction. In order to steer 
the beam, the relative phase shift between the elements is changed such that the 
beam radiates in a new direction. An infinite antenna array can be analyzed using a 
single unit cell, where the field at one periodic surface of a unit cell is related to the 
field at the opposite parallel surface of the unit cell through a simple phase shift. 
This makes it straightforward to utilize a unit cell to numerically analyze infinitely 
periodic phased array antenna structures in the frequency domain. Since the array 
factor in the infinite array is the delta function, the peak gains of the array as a 
function of the scan angle are mainly due to the element pattern variation with the 
polar angles θ and ϕ.
9.2.3.2	 Finite Array Modeling
Finite array modeling requires HFSS analysis of the complete array, which is time-
consuming. Planar finite-sized arrays can be approximated by an infinite array (unit 
cell) model, in conjunction with array factor, even though such an analysis neglects 
the complicated edge truncation effects, which often are dealt with by expensive 
and time-consuming measurements. Typically, the element radiation pattern is cal-
culated in an infinite array environment, and the array factor is calculated with 
two-dimensional FFT. All brute-force-type summing algorithm for array factor takes 
considerable amount of time so that it becomes impractical when the array becomes 
large or the analysis requires generating many events.
9.2.3.3	 Element Pattern
The embedded element pattern for wide-scan applications is impacted by mutual 
coupling effects and is quite different from an isolated element. Typical measured 
embedded element pattern of a CP element with 0.54λ interelement spacing with 
hexagonal grid lattice is plotted in Figure 9.17 with and without sequential rotation. 
The sequential rotation of the elements in the array improves the cross-pol and also 
improves the element roll-off, resulting in lower scan loss for the array. Element roll-
off is close to cos1.5θ function with sequential rotation of elements in the array and 
is cos1.8θ without sequential rotation. This is much steeper than cosθ roll-off that is 
often used in the array designs.
In several aircraft and spacecraft applications, different aperture shapes and dif-
ferent grids are used for arrays because of the practical accommodation limitations 
or design constraints. The grating lobe impact of these geometries is illustrated in 
Figure 9.18. It is plotted in the wave number plane (Kx, Ky); the dotted outer circle 
represents visible space and the solid inner circle represents the field of view (+/–70°). 
Circular aperture shape is best in terms of grating lobes and lower side lobe levels. 
Rectangular or square apertures are the worst, and parallelogram shaped apertures 
are in between the two. Circular/hexagonal aperture with hexagonal grid layout is 
the best choice for planar arrays. The impact of the grating lobes and side lobes of 
the grating lobes on the scanned patterns is illustrated in Figure 9.19 for different 
element spacings. Increasing the element spacing helps in reducing the number of 

9.2

elements, but the grating lobes come in closer, and the grating lobe side lobes have 
impact in the desired coverage region. When the element spacing is increased by 5% 
more than the optimized spacing, the grating lobes appear in the visible space. The 
impact of the grid angle and element spacing is illustrated in Figure 9.20. Intention 
of the plot is to show the effect of the grid angle and element. For example, with 
grid angle as 70°, the element space has to decrease by 8% in order to keep the 
grating lobe away from the visible space by the same amount of the angular space 
compared to the 60° grid angle case.
For planar arrays with small scan region such as a geo-stationary satellite, the 
element spacing can be much larger since the worst-case scan is about +/–8.7° in 
Figure 9.17  Typical element pattern useful for wide-scan arrays.

azimuth and elevation. The directivity and location of grating lobes as a function of 
element spacing (normalized to wavelength) are plotted in Figure 9.21. The number 
of elements is kept constant in the results shown in Figure 9.21 and are arranged 
in the hexagonal grid layout. Array directivity at the center of coverage and edge of 
the scan are shown. The difference between the two curves is the scan loss and also 
due to energy lost in the grating lobes. The element spacing has to be less than 3.7λ 
in order to keep the grating lobes away from the earth.
The antenna noise temperature varies a lot for geostationary applications, espe-
cially near the scan edges. Since the antenna sees a hot earth over the visible space 
and cold sky outside the earth’s field-of-view, the computed antenna patterns need to 
be integrated with weighted temperature for each beam location in order to compute 
the antenna noise temperature. This is computed using the equation

The antenna noise temperature is low when the beam is scanned to the edge, 
since half the power is radiated into cold sky and it depends on the element spacing. 
Larger element spacing creates the grating lobes on earth, increasing the noise tem-
perature. The antenna directivity, noise temperature, and computed G/T are plotted 
in Figure 9.22 for boresight and scanned beam as a function of element size. Varia-
tion of directivity and grating lobe locations as function scan are shown over a 14% 
frequency bandwidth in Figure 9.23. High frequency determines the closest grating

lobe, and the low frequency determines the minimum directivity. These two factors 
are useful guidelines for a phased array design with limited scan. Beam plots in the 
wave number plane often give useful information in the array design. An example 
is shown in Figure 9.24 for boresight and scanned beams of an array illustrating the 
grating lobes over the earth and beyond.

Low Gain TT&C Antennas
The telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&C) subsystem using low-gain antennas 
provides vital communication to and from the spacecraft. TT&C is the only way to 
observe and to control the spacecraft’s functions and conditions from the ground. The 
subsystem provides essential spacecraft management and control functions to keep

the satellite operating safely in orbit. Therefore, the TT&C subsystem provides the 
capability for simultaneous housekeeping telemetry, telecommand, and ranging for 
any satellite attitude, for all anticipated attitude rates, and during all mission phases. 
The TT&C links between the spacecraft and the ground are usually separate from 
the communications system links. TT&C links may operate in the same frequency 
bands or in other bands. TT&C is most often accomplished through a separate 
earth terminal facility specifically designed for the complex operations required to 
maintain a spacecraft in orbit. One TT&C facility may maintain several spacecrafts 
simultaneously in orbit through TT&C links to each vehicle.
TT&C Subsystem performs the following basic functions:
• Receive signals from the earth (uplink beam);
• Demodulate the command signals for further processing by the baseband 
equipment;
• Demodulate the ranging signal for remodulation on the telemetry carrier signals;
• Transmit the signals back to the earth (downlink beam).
The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) recommended frequency 
assignments for satellite communications developed at WARC-85, which are listed 
as follows:
Sub Band Designation
Frequency Range
L-Band
1.5–1.6 GHz
S-Band
2.5–2.6 GHz
C-Band
3.4–4.2, 5.9–6.7 GHz
Ku-Band
10.7–14.5, 17.3–17.8 GHz
Ka-Band
18.3–22.2, 27.0–31.0 GHz
Within each beam/coverage area, frequency reuse is accomplished by using 
orthogonally polarized beams
• Linear polarization schemes use vertical and horizontal electric field (e-field) 
beams;

322
Array Antennas and Low-Gain TT&C Antennas 
• Circular polarization schemes use left- and right-hand circularly rotating 
e-field beams;
• The choice of polarization scheme affects the design and cost of the ground 
terminals, ease of ground installation, adjacent satellite interference, and cross-
polarization interference.
Key TT&C requirements for satellite payloads are:
• Receive, decrypt, authenticate, and process commands;
• Collect, format, encrypt, and transmit satellite telemetry;
• Support satellite control functions;
–– Attitude determination and control;
–– Battery charge management, solar array pointing;
–– Autonomous configuration management;
• Support range determination from ground station(s);
• Provide antenna coverage for transfer and drift orbit operations and during 
on-orbit attitude anomalies.
During launch and early orbit phases (LEOP), the primary antennas for the space-
craft telemetry and ranging transmissions and the spacecraft command and ranging 
receptions are the TT&C antennas. A typical list of TT&C antennas includes the 
omni antennas, wide-coverage horn antennas, hemispherical antennas, and global 
horns. The omni antennas are either bi-conical antennas that generate toroidal 
radiation patterns or the horn antennas with cardioid type of pattern. While the 
bi-conical omni antennas can be configured with either linear or circular polariza-
tion, the cardioids predominantly are designed with circular polarization. Typical 
components of a TT&C RF subsystem are shown in Figure 9.25. Figure 9.26 also 
shows typical TT&C functional elements for a communications satellite application.
9.3.1	
TT&C Subsystem and Antenna Applications
The satellite TT&C subsystems comprise the antenna, command receiver, tracking 
and telemetry transmitter, and possibly tracking sensors. Telemetry data are received 
from other subsystems of the spacecraft, such as the payload, power, attitude con-
trol, and thermal control. Command data are relayed from the command receiver

9.3	
Low Gain TT&C Antennas

to other subsystems to control such parameters as antenna pointing, transponder 
modes of operation, battery and solar cell changes, and so on.
The elements on the ground include the TT&C antenna, telemetry receiver, 
command transmitter, tracking subsystem, and associated processing and analysis 
functions. Satellite control and monitoring is accomplished through monitors and 
keyboard interface.
Tracking refers to the determination of the current orbit, position, and move-
ment of the spacecraft. The tracking function is accomplished by several techniques. 
A simple method usually involves transmitting beacon signals from the satellite, 
which are received at the TT&C earth station. The doppler shift of the beacon (or 
the telemetry carrier) is monitored to determine the rate at which the range is chang-
ing (the range rate). Angular measurements from one or more earth terminals can 
be used to determine spacecraft location. The range can be determined by observing 
the time delay of a pulse or sequence of pulses transmitted from the satellite.
The telemetry function involves the collection of data from sensors on board 
the spacecraft and relaying this information to the ground. Fundamental telemetry 
parameters include:
• Unit on/off status;
• Unit temperatures;
• Transponder channel gain setting status;
Figure 9.26  TT&C subsystem basic block diagram.

324
Array Antennas and Low-Gain TT&C Antennas 
• Power amplifier health status parameters (i.e., helix or gate current, DC cur-
rent and anode voltage);
• Antenna pointing position (if applicable).
The telemetered data also include such parameters as voltage and current condi-
tions in the power subsystem, temperature of critical subsystems, status of switches 
and relays in the communications and antenna subsystems, fuel tank pressures, and 
attitude control sensor status. The telemetry signals are phase shift keyed on subcar-
riers, which in turn phase modulate the downlink telemetry carrier.
The command system relays specific control and operations information from 
the ground to the spacecraft, often in response to telemetry information received 
from the spacecraft. Parameters involved in typical command links include changes 
and corrections in attitude control and orbital control, antenna pointing and control, 
transponder mode of operation, and battery voltage control. The command system is 
used during launch to control the firing of the boost motor, deploy appendages such 
as solar panels and antenna reflectors, and “spin-up” a spin-stabilized spacecraft body.
Telemetry and command during the launch and transfer orbit phases usually 
requires a backup TT&C system, since the main TT&C system may be inoperable 
because the antenna is not deployed, or the spacecraft attitude is not proper for 
transmission to earth. The backup system usually operates with an omnidirectional 
antenna in conjunction with a wide-angle coverage antenna resonant at the TT&C 
operating frequencies, with sufficient margin to allow operation in the most adverse 
conditions. The backup system is also used if the main TT&C system fails on orbit.
9.3.2	
TT&C Antennas Introduction
The TT&C antenna systems on the spacecraft are used for transmitting and receiv-
ing the RF signals and are a critical part of the satellite communications system. The 
most important parameters that define the performance of an antenna are antenna 
gain, antenna beamwidth, cross polarization isolation, and antenna side lobes. The 
gain defines the increase in signal strength achieved in concentrating the radio-wave 
energy, either in transmission or reception mode, by the antenna system.
The common types of antennas used in satellite systems are the omni directional 
transmit and receive antenna and the wide coverage receive and transmit horn anten-
nas. These are low gain antennas and as such are susceptible to mutual interference 
and multipath effects, especially if the coverage from each antenna is combined to 
a single combined output. In addition, these low-gain antennas are susceptible to 
proximity effects from spacecraft structures and cause scattering. Omni antennas are 
used primarily for tracking, telemetry, and command links during launch and early 
orbit phase, where the spacecraft attitude has not yet been established. The omni 
antennas can be designed with either linear polarization or circular polarization.
Wide coverage horn antennas are used when relatively wide beams are required. 
These horns provide wide beam coverage with half-power beamwidth of ±30° and 
adequate gain to close the TT&C radio links. The wide-coverage antennas can be 
designed with linear polarization or integrated with septum polarizers that provide 
circular polarization. When combined with the omni antenna pattern, the combined 
pattern is as shown in Figure 9.27.

9.3	
Low Gain TT&C Antennas
325
A critical performance aspect of the wide-coverage horn and the omni antenna 
patterns, when each antenna coverage is combined to produce a composite coverage 
of the TT&C signals, is that the wide-coverage horn antenna (WCA) is designed 
such that its gain falls rapidly beyond ±60° in order to lower or minimize multipath 
interference on the TT&C antenna coverage caused by scattering of signals from the 
spacecraft nadir panel. The omni antenna gain variation is less pronounced, but its 
interference contribution to the wide-coverage horn has to be minimized. A typical 
layout of the omni and WCA on the spacecraft deck is shown in Figure 9.28 where 
the omni is placed much higher that the deck and WCA is at the deck level. Com-
bined omni and WCA patterns without deck and including scattering effects from 
spacecraft deck are shown in Figure 9.29. The spacecraft scattering increases the 
co-polar ripples, increases the cross-polar levels, and reduces the coverage gain. It is 
important that the scattering analysis is performed to optimize locations of the Omni 
& WCA and assess the worst-case RF performance of these low-gain antennas [17].
Hemispherical antennas are used in satellites that have a different early orbit/
transfer orbit profile. These antennas have hemispherical coverage pattern with peak

gain in the boresight tapering off to 10 dB below the peak but providing sufficient 
gain to close the command and telemetry link. The orbit profile is compatible with 
the spacecraft having achieved three-axis stabilization after launch vehicle separa-
tion. The hemispherical antennas are typically circularly polarized, either single or 
dual orthogonal.
Global horns are used for command and telemetry transmission during on-station 
operation after the spacecraft has achieved geosynchronous operation when there is 
a need for the TT&C subsystem antenna coverage to be independent of the payload 
antenna and payload system. The global horn, as the name implies, has a half-power 
beamwidth of ±9° that covers the earth diameter equatorially and provides 17 dBi 
gain. The peak gain is typically 20 dBi. The global horn can be designed with linear 
polarization or circular polarization.
The global horns are also used for on-station beacon tracking for pointing the 
ground station antennas to the beacon signal from the satellite. It is important to 
remember that antenna misalignment can lead to offset earth coverage and degraded 
uplink and downlink performance. Poor polarization congruency can lead to cross-
polarization interference from within the satellite.

9.3.3	
TT&C RF Block Diagram and Link Budgets
A typical block diagram of an RF section of the subsystem is shown in Figure 9.30. 
Uplink command signals received by the wide coverage receive horn and the receive 
omni antenna are combined in the quadrature hybrid and fed to the redundant 
command receivers. Similarly, the telemetry transmitter output power from one or 
both telemetry transmitters are combined in the transmit quadrature hybrid and fed 
to the wide-coverage transmit horn and the transmit omni antenna. The telemetry 
transmitter has typically two mutually exclusive modes of operation, namely the 
high-power and the low-power mode, respectively. The transmitters operate in high-
power mode during LEOP. During on-station operation, the high-power mode of 
each transmitter is switched off and the transmitters operate in low-power mode. 
Since the low-power output of the telemetry transmitters is low, the high gain of 
the communications antenna provides high on-station telemetry EIRP ensuring that 
the power flux density of the telemetry radiation does not exceed the ITU regula-
tory limits.
Figure 9.31 summarizes the mutual multipath interference losses for each antenna 
path utilizing the combined radiation patterns of the wide-coverage horn and the 
omni antenna and the coverage requirements for each antenna. Losses in each antenna 
path are those encountered from the antenna to the hybrid where the signals from 
each antenna are combined.
Figure 9.32 shows a typical command link budget based on the command flux 
density at each antenna and the command receiver threshold performance signal 
level of −142 dBW. Figure 9.33 shows a typical telemetry EIRP link performance 
based on the telemetry transmitter high-power output and the line losses including

communication is of paramount importance under all modes of spacecraft opera-
tion, including but not limited to spacecraft attitude anomalies, loss of earth-lock 
or others that may prevent the spacecraft from earth-pointing. For this reason, the 
TT&C subsystem primarily utilizes low-gain antennas that provide omnidirectional 
radiation pattern. Since no single antenna can achieve spherical radiation in the 
presence of large scattering objects, such as spacecraft earth panel, structures, and 
waveguide feeds, it is augmented with one or more additional antennas of different 
configuration and combining each pattern to form a composite radiation pattern 
that satisfies the spacecraft requirements in terms of antenna coverage angles and 
gain to provide positive radio link performance.
There are two commonly used configurations to provide the omnidirectional 
pattern:
a)	 A combination of a bi-conical antenna (that has a toroidal radiation pattern) 
with a wide-coverage antenna that has a cardioidal pattern shape is often 
used to provide more than hemispherical coverage. Since the antennas are 
resonant at either the command frequency or the telemetry frequencies, it 
is necessary to implement this antenna combination for the TT&C receive 
and transmit frequencies, respectively. The omni antenna itself is composed 
of a transmit bi-cone located at the bottom with the receive bi-cone at the 
top in a single antenna structure. This structure is typically located on the 
spacecraft and mounted on a boom or a tripod for obstruction-free field 
of view from the radiating bi-cones. The receive bi-cone operates at either 
edge of the communications receive band while the transmit bi-cone oper-
ates at either edge of the transmit communications band. This configuration 
is predominantly implemented on some North American spacecraft bus. A 
schematic view of this configuration on the satellite is shown in Figure 9.34, 
which shows the ideal contributions from each radiating element (continuous 
lines) and the combined omnidirectional radiation pattern (dashed line). The 
measured radiation pattern of the actual implementation will be different from 
the ideal spherical shape; however, it will be shown to be compliant to the 
TT&C subsystem specification requirement as described later in this section.
b)	 A combination of two hemispherical antennas, one located on the nadir 
facing side and the other on the zenith facing side of the spacecraft. This is 
typically the preferred configuration in spacecraft bus of European satel-
lite suppliers. Figure 9.35 shows the schematic of this configuration and 
the resultant combined radiation patterns. It should be noted that this is an 
ideal theoretical pattern; in real practice, it is not usually possible to achieve 
perfectly symmetric omnidirectional patterns.
An overview of the main types of low-gain antennas (LGA) designed for TT&C 
RF applications with an explanation of the omni directional antenna design con-
figuration is provided in this section. Antennas with specific TT&C applications 
are also included.
9.3.4.1	 Bi-conical Antennas
Bi-conical omni antennas are used widely in satellites as a constituent part of the 
TT&C RF Subsystem. They provide a toroidal radiation pattern and are mainly used 

330
Array Antennas and Low-Gain TT&C Antennas 
in combination with other LGA to provide omnidirectional coverage during transfer 
orbit, drift orbit, and on-station mission orbit for communications between satel-
lite and the ground stations. A generic requirement of the omni antenna is shown 
in Figure 9.36. An example of the radiation pattern of the toroidal omni antenna 
with both copolar and cross-polar components is shown in Figure 9.37. It usually 
covers the range of ±20° from the horizontal plane, providing a gain above 0 dBi 
with good polarization purity (cross-polar values below −20 dBi). Figure 9.38 shows 
typical gain mask requirement for the omni antenna.
The omni antennas cover various frequency bands, from S-band to Ka-band. The 
most common configuration of this toroidal antenna design is to stack the transmit 
and receive antennas vertically one on top of the other. The transmit bi-cone is located 
at the bottom of the omni antenna structures while the receive bi-cone is located at 
the top. This is due to the fact that the receive bi-cone is smaller than the transmit 
bi-cone due to higher frequency. The mechanical design of the omni antenna is such 
that it endures those demanding mechanical stresses imposed by the launch vehicles 
and also the thermal environment that the antenna has to experience in all the satel-
lite operating modes through the life of the satellite. The electrical design is such that 
the electrical performance is consistently maintained in all satellite operating modes 
and environments. Some examples can be seen in Figure 9.39. The antenna on the 
left operates in the Ku-band and is circularly polarized. The omni antenna shown 
on the right operates in the C-band and has linear polarization. Both receive and 
transmit bi-cones have linear vertical polarization. It can be seen that the polarization

depends on the inclination of the cavity slots. The coaxial feeds for transmit and 
receive bi-cones are shown at the bottom of the mounting baseplate.
Principle of Operation
The bi-cones are fed by a resonant cavity with a number of rectangular apertures or 
slots within the bi-cone aperture. The electric field waves traveling up the waveguide 
feed will couple into these slots, create surface currents around the slot edges on the 
exterior wall of the cavity, and these currents in turn will radiate to the open space 
between the bi-cones. Although a simple process, certain design considerations have 
to be taken into account.
The slots are designed to be narrow and of a certain length at the operating 
frequency. The slot length is approximately λ/2. However, since the position of the 
slots, the number of slots, and thickness affect the resonant frequency, it has to be 
determined experimentally. In terms of fields, a resonant slot can only be excited 
by an electric field normal to its length, and this field will radiate outwards. There-
fore, the orientation of the slot will determine the radiated polarization. It may be 
located vertically, horizontally, or in a 45° inclination angle to the left or the right. 
The design concept can be seen in Figure 9.40 for the isolated narrow rectangular 
slot, together with its characteristic radiation pattern. It presents a commonly used

vertical slot distribution to achieve horizontal linear polarization. Typically, the 
slots are uniformly distributed on the wall of a circular or coaxial resonant cavity.
Figure 9.41 shows a simplified representation of the fields and currents for the 
TE11 mode in the circular waveguide and the TEM mode in the coaxial waveguide. 
It can be seen how the waveguide may support two currents of opposite orienta-
tion, namely, the axial and transverse currents directed in the xy-plane. At a given 
point, these two currents alternate as the wave propagates along the waveguide. In 
order to support the excitation of the fields for radiation, the slots must generate 
these currents. Depending on the desired radiated polarization (i.e., orientation of 
the slots), the appropriate mode needs to be fed with the proper polarization (either 
linear or circular).
Depending on the choice of the feeding method, the resonant cavity has to be 
either λ/2 or λ height to ensure that the maximum of current will be located at the 
center position of the slots. The short must then be located at λ/4 or λ/2 from the 
center of the slot. The number of slots placed on the waveguide wall must be suf-
ficient to ensure acceptable rotational symmetry around the longitudinal z-axis of 
the radiated pattern.

TEM mode in a coaxial.

Array Antennas and Low-Gain TT&C Antennas 
Once the fields are radiated from the slots, they travel along the space between 
the bi-cones of the antenna as spherical waves, producing a toroidal pattern that is 
non-directional in the horizontal plane. The main function of the bi-cones is to pro-
duce a uniform phase-front with a larger aperture than that of the slotted circular 
waveguide such that the desired polarization is achieved with increased directivity.
Bi-conical antennas are considered as conical horn aperture antennas by many 
classic authors. Under this assumption, the radiation pattern can be determined if 
the aperture geometry and fields distribution are known. Figure 9.42 shows a bi-
cone geometry.
For all practical purposes, the bi-cone can be regarded as a cylindrical aperture 
with quadratic phase distribution, considering that the antenna has rotational sym-
metry around the z-axis, which results in the gain approximation [18]:
 	
Gain = 10 log (2H/λ) − ATL − PEL	
(9.21)
where H, is the distance between the end of the cones. Phase error loss (PEL) is 
extracted from well-known tables, depending on the quadratic phase distribution 
constant S = H2/(8λR) and the field distribution. Note that for vertical linear polariza-
tion, the distribution of the fields will be uniform and will present no amplitude taper 
loss (ATL). Horizontal polarization, however, presents both PEL and ATL = 0.91, 
since it has a cosine distribution between the cones. R is the slant radius of the cone. 
The result will be accurate enough for an initial design stage. Refinement to the final 
co-polar and cross-polar components will need to be performed by simulations. 
Figure 9.43 shows an example of the measured radiation pattern of a bi-conical 
antenna. The pattern refers to the upper bi-cone of the antenna, which is the receive 
section of the omni antenna.
The bi-cone was designed to radiate at 14.5 GHz with horizontal polarization. 
Applying (9.21), the calculated gain is 4.56 dBi, which is very close to the measured 
gain of 4.3 dBi.
In the case of a bi-conical antenna radiating with circular polarization, gain may 
be approximated using either uniform or cosine distribution, since both will produce 
a very similar result. The slots will be inclined 45° to provide to orthogonal compo-
nents with the same amplitude. The 90° phase offset between orthorgonal compo-
nents required for the circular polarization will be introduced by the bi-cones, since 
the horizontal component will travel as if in free space while the vertical component

is a spherical wave traveling in a parallel plate waveguide. This difference in paths 
will determine the axial ratio performance.
Thin metal corrugations, or chokes, of height λ /4 are added to the end of the 
cones to reduce edge diffraction and, therefore, cross-polarization. This λ /4 chokes 
behave like an open-ended transmission line, preventing the surface currents to flow 
past the edge and outwards and hence reducing the electric field radiating from 
outside the bi-cones. Both axial and radial chokes have been used in this type of 
antennas, presenting similar performances.
The design of the feeding network of this type of antennas is critical, since the 
receive antenna is located right on top of the transmit one. It is necessary to have 
the RX feed lines reaching the antenna across the TX antenna without interfering 
with it. For circularly polarized and linear vertically polarized omni antennas, the 
feeding of the radiating elements is implemented by a single feed point, including a 
simple transmission line for each of the antennas (TX and RX). The resulting electri-
cal scheme is simple and the physical configuration is easy to implement, as shown 
in the left part of Figure 9.44. In the case of a horizontally polarized antenna, the

radiating element has to be fed with a circularly polarized signal. This means that 
two polarizers are to be implemented in the assembly, one for each bi-cone antenna. 
This configuration can be seen in the right part of the same figure.
One known solution [19] is to route the signals to the antennas by means of 
coaxial cables. This has the drawbacks of introducing intermediate connectors and 
soldering between elements, while reducing the mass and envelope. Another known 
solution is to use a Turnstile junction as bypassing element [20]. This avoids the 
use of cables and intermediate junctions, resulting in a robust and reliable solution.
Interaction with Environment
As the bi-cone antenna configuration has the receive and transmit bi-cones stacked 
one on top of the other with the need of a baseplate to be attached to the mounting 
structure, it is necessary to avoid interference between both bi-cones and the base-
plate. Typically, the antenna is mounted on a boom on the spacecraft antenna panel 
or on a tripod on the earth deck to elevate the omni antenna to a sufficient height 
to provide a clear, obstruction-free field of view to the RX and TX radiators. The 
baseplate is mounted on the tripod or the boom so that the coaxial cables feeding 
the two antennas can be easily accessible for mounting and integration. Therefore, 
appropriate selection of the distance between the omni antenna sections is required 
so that the radiation patterns are not affected and at the same time minimize the 
size and the mass of the unit.
The effect of the transmitting bi-cone (lower bi-cone) pattern on the receive bi-
cone (upper bi-cone) radiation pattern can be controlled and minimized by increasing 
the separation distance between them. The baseplate under the TX bi-cone is criti-
cal, since the ground plane is much larger in comparison. The distance required to 
completely avoid the effect of the baseplate on the transmitting radiation pattern is 
in most cases unacceptable from the mechanical point of view, so a trade-off between 
mass and antenna performances is necessary. Figure 9.45 presents the effect of the 
size of the baseplate on the transmitting antenna radiation pattern. As the diameter 
of the baseplate becomes larger, the cross-polarization degrades and the gain ripple 
increases due to undesired reflections. The effect of the distance from the baseplate 
to the antenna is similar to the effect of its radius.
As an example of how sensitive the toroidal pattern of the bi-cone is to the ele-
ments surrounding it, Figure 9.46 shows the measurements for a configuration of 
the bi-conical antenna on top of a pole plus two global horns mounted on the same 
ground plane. In the conical theta cuts, the effect of the horns can be easily seen 
for ϕ greater than 90°, since the bi-cones are situated a short distance above the 
aperture levels of the horns. As ϕ increases, so do the reflections from the two side

horizontally polarized antennas (right).

antennas. This shows that the location and positioning of the bi-conical antenna on 
the satellite is critical, and the reason why it is elevated well above other spacecraft 
structures to present a clear field of view minimizing the scattering from other ele-
ments, solar panels, and reflectors.
9.3.4.2	 Wide Coverage Antennas (WCA)
Wide coverage antennas are used in conjunction with the omni antennas in the 
TT&C RF subsystem to provide ±30° coverage along the nadir axis to enable earth 
updates for the earth sensor and also provide on-station emergency coverage, should 
the spacecraft lose earth-lock and the spacecraft attitude is temporarily unstable. The 
WCA pattern fills the coverage where the toroidal omni antenna patterns have nulls 
[17]. In some cases, the wide-coverage horn is also used for telemetry transmission 
with limited telemetry EIRP for on-station operations, contingent on the require-
ment that the telemetry EIRP is sufficient to close the link with the ground station 
with adequate margin under worst-case propagation condition, including rain loss 
and maximum modulation loss. This combined antenna coverage approach yields 
omnidirectional coverage that extends from ±70° to ±110° in addition to the WCA 
coverage. Figure 9.47 summarizes key requirements of a WCA. Figure 9.48 shows 
the typical WCA requirement.
These antennas are typically required to provide ±30° from the satellite spin axis, 
with a gain of 7 dBi at the edge of coverage with a peak gain of 12 dBi. Secondary 
lobes are usually controlled by design synthesis to ensure that the WCA gain does 
not interfere with the omni antenna gain and that the WCA radiation pattern itself

Array Antennas and Low-Gain TT&C Antennas 
falls off as rapidly as is practically possible. Therefore, the WCAs are required by 
design to confine secondary lobes to −10 dBi or less.
A radiation pattern with good pattern symmetry, low secondary lobes, and 
good cross-polarization can be achieved with a relatively simple multimode horn. 
There are many types of multimode horns as there are just as many ways to gener-
ate higher order modes. An overview of multimode horns is given earlier [21]. They 
basically consist in “introducing an axial symmetrical discontinuity in radial direc-
tion.” Among them, the stepped discontinuity was studied by P. D. Potter [22], and

based on it, the sharp flare angle section by Turrin [23]. Two types are described, 
namely, the dual flare horn and the hybrid mode horn.
9.3.4.3	 Dual-Flare Horn
A dual flare horn [23] is a type of conical multimode horn, which combines the TE11 
and TM11 modes to provide the required performance characteristics. The starting 
point is a conical horn, which from the well-known curves of A. P. King [24] will be 
around 2λ in length and diameter. Figure 9.49 shows a receive and a transmit dual 
flare wide coverage antennas.
Principle of Operation
The TE11 mode is propagating in the waveguide that feeds the horn, and the TM11 
mode is generated by a sharp flare angle discontinuity (θ) past the throat of the horn. 
Figure 9.50 shows a dual flare horn cross section.
The flare angle determines the amount of TM11 mode that is generated, and 
the section of length l ensures that the two modes combine at the aperture with

the correct phase. Based on the study from Turrin [23], the TM11 mode needs to be 
phase-shifted by 90° with respect to the TE11 at the end of the flared section (Plane 
B), and therefore a 270° phase difference between the two modes is obtained in the 
phase section. The values of the flare angle (θ in degrees) and phasing section length 
(l) are then extracted to give the optimum amount of TM11 mode that combines 
with the TE11 for optimum cross-polar and secondary lobes levels:

Further optimization of the flare angle and the phasing section of the horn allow 
very low cross-polarization, and secondary lobe level over a wide bandwidth (up 
to 20%) can be achieved. An example of a real antenna’s typical performance is 
shown in Figure 9.51.
The amount of TM11 mode that combines with the TE11 determines the level of 
cross-polar and secondary lobes. The optimum value between the two is 47% TM 
mode and 53% TE mode [23, 25].
9.3.4.4	 Hybrid Mode Horn
The hybrid mode horn is another type of multimode antenna, which uses the HE11 
and HE12 modes. They appeared as a response to the need for a uniform illumina-
tion in prime focus reflectors [25]. The performance of this type of horn can be very 
similar to the dual flare horn, but the resulting antenna is much shorter. A flight 
model of a transmit and receive WCA assembly of this type of antennas is shown 
in Figure 9.52. Figure 9.53 shows the measured radiation pattern of the hybrid 
mode WCA. The Hybrid mode WCA pattern exhibits a faster gain roll-off from the 
required coverage angles of ±30° compared to the dual flare horn.
Thomas and Bathker [26] evolved on Potter’s concept [22] of the TE11 and TM11 
modes combination. They applied the same principles over a corrugated surface, 
which would support hybrid modes: the lower order mode HE11 plus the higher order 
HE12. As with Potter’s, an abrupt step discontinuity is used to generate the higher 
order HE12 mode with the appropriate level, and λ /4 depth corrugations support 
the propagation of the hybrid modes along the horn. Figure 9.54 shows the hybrid 
mode WCA cross section.
The corrugated line from the abrupt transition to the aperture determines the 
phase difference between the two modes. The characteristic radiation pattern of this 
type of antenna presents a dip at the boresight. Clarricoats and Olver [27] present 
a parametric study on the resulting radiation pattern from different phase combi-
nations between the two modes, or, in other words, from different lengths of the 
corrugated section.

Array Antennas and Low-Gain TT&C Antennas 
9.3.4.5	 Hemispherical Antennas
Hemispherical antennas are commonly used by the European satellite bus to produce 
the omnidirectional radiation pattern required for TT&C coverage. They are known 
as choked waveguide feeds, since they are also used as feeds for reflectors, or choked 
aperture antennas. By using two of these antennas facing opposite directions, one on 
the nadir facing side and the other on the zenith facing side, a practically spherical 
radiation pattern is achieved. Therefore, a set of transmit and receive hemispherical 
antennas facing opposite directions would yield the required coverage. The hemi-
spherical antenna generates a cardioidal pattern that has a θ coverage extending ±90.

9.3	
Low Gain TT&C Antennas

The gain fall at the end of coverage varies depending on the specific requirements. 
An example of typical specification for a generic choked antenna is shown in Fig-
ure 9.55. Figure 9.56 shows the typical gain template for a hemispherical antenna.
Figure 9.57 shows the photographs of a C-band hemispherical antenna with 
radome and a Ku-band hemispherical antenna. Together with the minimum gain 
that must be achieved within the antenna coverage, it is also important to minimize 
to a minimum the back lobe radiation. The return loss must be maintained for the 
whole frequency range, which in this type of antennas may reach 20% (typically less).

344
Array Antennas and Low-Gain TT&C Antennas 
The hemispherical antennas consist of a circular waveguide aperture with a cor-
rugated flange at the end, which contributes to a very simple and robust configura-
tion. The concentric corrugations, or chokes, are excited by the aperture coupling 
through the open end of the waveguide. The radius of the waveguide will deter-
mine the gain, beamwidth, cross-polarization, and back lobes level of the radiating 
waveguide opening. Adding the axial chokes provides an overall improvement. By 
controlling the chokes geometry on the flange and its position with respect to the 
aperture, symmetry on the E- and H-planes radiation patterns over a wide coverage 
range (typically θ = 70°) is achieved, together with increased bandwidth and cross-
polarization reduction. A study on the effects of the distance of the corrugated flange 
to the circular aperture can be found in Agarwal and Nagelberg [28], together with 
the variation of the main planes phase centers.
This type of antenna is generally implemented with circular polarization, both 
RHCP and LHCP. The antenna feed is provided through polarizers situated below 
the mounting plate. Typical radiation patterns are shown in Figure 9.58.
9.3.4.6	 Global Coverage Antennas
Global coverage antennas are used as part of the TT&C subsystem when the space-
craft has achieved geosynchronous operation mode. It is used for receiving command

signals and transmitting telemetry signals from and to the ground stations. It is also 
used for transmitting unmodulated beacon signals to the ground for spacecraft point-
ing of the ground antenna terminals. Global horns are also used for transmitting 
telemetry signal with residual carrier for pointing. A global horn antenna can perform 
only one of these tasks or several, and they vary in complexity since the bandwidth 
of the horn can be very narrow, for a horn operating only as beacon transmitter, to 
wide band if both transmit and receive functions are assigned to the same antenna. 
Due to these varied possibilities, practical implementations of global horns range 
from simple smoothed wall horns like Potter horns of dual-flared conical horn to 
the more complex and expensive (but wideband) corrugated horns.
They provide global coverage of the earth from the geostationary orbit, so the 
coverage of these antennas is about ±9°. Figure 9.59 summarizes the salient gain 
features of a global coverage antenna.
The pattern requirement means that global horns are typically larger than 6λ, 
which, depending on the band of operation, can lead to a big and heavy device. 
They are normally implemented in aluminum, but other materials such as carbon 
fiber can be used for some of the larger examples of global horns. Figure 9.60 shows 
examples of C-band global horns.
Global horns can be divided into three groups:
• Narrowband, implemented with simple Potter horns;
• Medium band, implemented with dual-flared horns;
• Broadband, implemented with corrugated horns.
For the dual-flared conical global horns, the principles of operations are the 
same as for the WCAs described earlier.
A brief description of the Potter horn and the corrugated global horn follow. 
More details are given in other chapters of this book.

Array Antennas and Low-Gain TT&C Antennas 
Potter Horn
Potter horns find application as global horns when very narrow bandwidth require-
ments are set, such as beacon horns. Potter [22] presented a solution for pattern 
symmetry and low side lobes, which consisted of utilizing a combination of the TE11 
and TM11 modes. The intrinsic benefits on cross-polarization were not studied at 
that time. Later publications [21] addressed this aspect.
To generate the TM11 mode, an abrupt step is introduced in the path of the 
input waveguide, which carries the dominant TE11. The amount of TM11 mode that 
is generated depends on the step dimension. The relation between the step and the 
percentage between the modes has been studied earlier [28, 29].
Corrugated Horn
The corrugated horns provide good axial symmetry and very low cross-polarization 
over very wide bandwidths of more than 50%. They support the HE11 hybrid mode, 
which is a combination of the TE11 and TM11 modes. The electric fields can be seen 
in Figure 9.61.
A cross section of a corrugated horn profile and its main parameters are shown 
in Figure 9.62.
The corrugated surface presents different reactances in the z and phi directions. 
By providing Xϕ = 0 and Xz = ∞, the conditions to lock the TE11 and TM11 mode 
into the hybrid mode are realized. By selecting h = (2n − 1) λ /4 deep slots along the 
horn walls, a short circuit appears at each corrugation, and the previously mentioned 
Figure 9.61  Creation of hybrid mode HE11.

reactance conditions are achieved; thus, the horn walls support the propagation of 
the hybrid mode along it. Normally, due to manufacturing issues, the shortest depth 
(λ /4) is chosen.
The corrugated horn is excited by a circular waveguide carrying the fundamen-
tal TE11 mode. A mode converter at the beginning of the corrugated section excites

the TM11 mode to generate the hybrid mode, which will propagate along the horn. 
A section of λ/2 slots, the mode converter, excite the higher order mode, and then 
the slots are tapered until the nominal λ/4 depth is reached. A cross section of the 
mode converter can be seen in Figure 9.63.
Extensive design criteria for the slot design can be found [27, 29]. A simple 
example of a typical radiation pattern from a corrugated horn is shown in Figure 9.64.
