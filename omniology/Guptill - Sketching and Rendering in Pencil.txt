THE PENCIL POINTS LIBRARY.
ANY
readers
of PENCIL POINTS have suggested
to
us
the need
for
n
group
of
books
dealing
in
a
thoroughly
practical
and
helpful
way
with
subjects
of
interest
to
architects,
draftsmen
and
students
a
library
embracing
the varied
interests
that
centre
in
the'
drafting room.
Some
time ago we
called upon
the
readers
of PENCIL POINTS
to
suc/f/esi subjects jor treatment
in such a group of books, and we have
carefully
siuaicd
the
targe
number
of
replies
received.
Guided
by
ihese suggestion:: and by
the
indications of special interest on the pan
of readers
in
certain
articles which have appeared
serially
in
PENCIL
POINTS, we
have
prepared
a
plan
for THE
PENCIL
POINTS
LIHRAKY,
which
is to be developed as time goes on.
The
fundamental
idea
is
to
provide
books
to
meet
the
definite
needs
of
large numbers
of men
in-
this
field, and
to
do
this
at
as
moderate
a
price
as
is found
consistent
with
the
satisfactory
presen-
tation
of
the
matter;
not
costly
publications
of
limited
appeal,
but
a
practical working
library.
"Sketching
and
Rendering
in
Pencil,"
by
Arthur
L.
Cuplill,
is
the
first book
in THE PENCIL POINTS
LIBRARY.
The second book
will
be "Details
of Construction," by Philip
G. Knobloch, which
is now
in
preparation.
Additional books
to be published in
the near future are:
"The Study
of Architectural
Design,"
by John
F. Harbeson ;
"Inte-
riors
Old
and New";
"The
Aesthetics
of
Building
Materials," and
"Architectural
Lettering."
It
is the purpose of the publishers
to add books
to
this
library as
the need for them
is determined and as arrangements with
the authors
best
qualified
to produce them
can
be made.
Thi
publishers desire
to thank
all who
have, by
their suggestions
or
otherwise, encouraged them
to
enter upon
the
production
of
this
Library and
to ask for further suggestions
either from
those desiring
to
offer manuscripts for
publication
or from
those who
see
the need
for a book on a given subject that would
fit logically
into THE PENCIL
POINTS LIBRARY.

PREFACE.
AN
ARTISTIC
conception
is
susceptible
of
translation into graphic expression through a
variety of media, but by a certain universality
of custom, or perhaps more accurately of convenience,
the
familiar
lead
pencil
has achieved
a
significance
derived from its immediate association with all forms
of
pictorial
delineation.
One may
speak
of
it
as
a kind of
staff upon which the
artist or the drafts-
man
leans most
heavily.
But
this popular
accept-
ance or
recognition
has,
curiously
enough,
failed
to
carry
with
it
an
equivalent
degree
of
appre-
ciative
comment
or
of
authoritative
instruction
in
the
technique
of
its
individual
employment.
Therefore, an examination of the text and
illustra-
tions
contained
in
this volume must
be
of
special
and compelling
interest
to any one
of
artistic pro-
fession
or
aspirations,
for
in
his accomplished and
excellent
interpretation
of
the
potentiality
existent
within
the
pencil,
Mr.
Guptill
is
practically a
pio-
neer.
By far the greater acknowledgment must be given,
however,
to the very
definite stimulus contained
in
this
volume
toward a
really
effective
educational
development among
architectural
draftsmen.
The
atelier system which offers an inexpensive means of
acquiring
certain
architectural
training,
based
on
the
general
principles
of
instruction
at
the
Ecole
des Beaux Arts in Paris, nevertheless, stops short of
completeness from the
lack of
stress placed on the
important
element
of
free-hand
drawing.
Great
emphasis
is
properly
laid
on
the
solution
of
the
plan and
its
presentation
but
the adherence
to
the
mechanical
method more
or
less
predicated
in
the
drawing of the two-dimensioned plan, has been car-
ried with almost
equal
insistence
into
the study
of
the three-dimensioned
elevation.
Out of
this prac-
tice has grown
a kind of
formalized T-square and
triangle
"indication,"
much
in
vogue,
and
with
scarcely more
suggestive
value
than
the working
drawing produced with the other mechanical
para-
phernalia of ruling pens, compasses and dividers.
Most draftsmen avoid the blunted pencil point as
they would
a
plague.
A
large
part
of
their
time
is spent
in sharpening the
pencil
to the length and
sharpness
of
a
needle.
With
such
an
implement
their
horizon
is narrowed down
to the production
of scale drawings and the conventionalized
sectional
hatchings
indicative
of
various
materials.
Form
expressed
in
the
graceful,
flowing
suavity
of
line
becomes a remote possibility under such conditions.
If
I am dwelling with some
insistence upon the
value of
free-hand drawing,
it
is not
in disparage-
ment
of
instrumental drawing, nor
with any view
to
its
neglect.
It
is
rather
in
the
desire
to
build
something more
vital and engaging on this founda-
tion
of
mechanical
skill
which
will
result
in
the
draftsman
becoming
ever
increasingly
more
of
a
draftsman
that
I most
earnestly
recommend
this
book.
Mr. Guptill has with every evidence of
suc-
cess endeavored
to
assist the draftsman out of
this
automatic conventionalized indication into the realm
of
appreciation
of
the
greater
artistic
possibilities
lying within
himself.
To
suggest
to others a way
of
increasingly
beautiful
accomplishment
is
ob-
viously
no
slight
contribution.
This
volume
is
a
plea for better instruction in free-hand drawing and
for
the thorough perception of
its value.
The
illustrations accompanying the
text, by their
variety and excellence of selection and their orderly
arrangement,
furnish
in themselves a basis of
sug-
gestion
to
students which
should awaken the most
enthusiastic
response.
The
initial
and
almost
certain
discouragement
which the making of a drawing from
life connotes,
inevitably becomes an emotion
of compelling
inter-
est once a grasp of the elements of form and con-
tour has been accomplished.
I know of no way in
which
artistic
capital,
in
the
sense
of
facility and
sureness of drawing, can be obtained
better than by
drawing
from
life
and
the
transition
from
the
plastic model to the rendering of the static architec-
tural ornament enables the student to embody in his
drawing the spirit of the design with a sureness and
a refinement of
detail
not
possible
to one who has
not passed through the former experience.
There
is some
distance
to be travelled
along the
road of
artistic endeavor before the student can ex-
press
his personality
in the composed
statement
of
the artist.
Mr. Guptill has,
I think, in pointing out
the road and contributing to
its illumination, wisely
kept away
from
the
indication
of
style.
His
in-
sistence has been
in the
line of encouragement of a
greater
fluency
of
speech
in
the
language
of
pencil
technique and
of
the
assistance
that
intelli-
gent conventionalization can render in the presenta-
tion of form and of color and of materials.

ILLUSTRATIONS BY THE AUTHOR
Drawings by the author,
illustrating points brought
out in the text, are found throughout this work and
are designated as Figures
1 through
53.

It
is
a pleasure
for the author
to express here
his
grate-
ful appreciation of the co-operation of
all those who have
contributed towards the making of
this volume
especially
to
Walter
Scott
Perry,
under whom,
as
Director
of
the
School
of Fine and Applied
Arts,
Pratt
Institute,
Brook-
lyn, New
York
City,
the
lectures upon
which
this work
is based were prepared, and to the artists who have kindly
given
permission
for
the
reproduction
of
the
drawings
shown
in
the
supplementary
illustrations.

FOREWORD.
IN
VIEW
of
the
popularity
that
the
pencil has
long
enjoyed
as
a medium
of
artistic
expres-
sion,
it seems
rather
strange
that
so
little
has
been written relating exclusively to
it.
For
it
is cer-
tainly
true, whatever
the
reasons may
he
for
this
apparent neglect on the part of our writers,
reasons
on which
it
is
idle and
irrelevant to speculate here,
that though there
is a wealth of
material dealing
with
kindred
subjects,
contributions
hearing
di-
rectly on the uses of this universal medium are few
and meagre
indeed.
This
dearth
of
material became
clearly apparent
to
the author when
he was
called
upon, some
ten
years
ago,
to teach
pencil
sketching and
technique
in
the
art
and
architectural
classes
at
Pratt
In-
stitute,
for
at
that time
a book was
sought which
might be employed as a text and reference work for
his students.
As nothing seemed available complete
enough
to
satisfactorily meet
all
the
requirements,
a
series of
lectures
was
prepared
by
the
author,
based on
his own
training
in
art and
architecture,
which, after having been revised and amplified from
time to time to meet the needs of the various classes
under
his
instruction,
forms the
basis of
this
pres-
ent volume.
Some of
these lectures were arranged
for pupils
seeking a
general
art education
;
others were espe-
cially
for
architectural
students,
while
a
few,
tak-
ing up
the
representation
of
furniture,
draperies
and
the
like, were used
for
the
classes
in
interior
decoration.
As
records were
kept
in
all
of
these
classes
from
year
to
year
of
the
difficulties
most
frequently encountered and of
points which seemed
to
require
the most thorough
explanation;
also
of
the mistakes most commonly made by the pupils,
it
was
possible
to
so
revise
the
lectures
as
to
antici-
pate
and
cover
in
advance many
of
the
questions
and
problems
which
might
otherwise
have
given
trouble.
An
effort was made
to guide
the
student
step-by-step through the work, explaining each part
with the greatest
care.
\Yhen
arrangements were made
in
1920
to
pre-
pare
a
serial
article on
the
subject
of
"Sketching
and
Rendering
in
Pencil"
for
"Pencil
Points"
it
obviously became
necessary
to approach
the whole
subject from the standpoint of the architect and the
architectural
draftsman
and
student,
so
arranging
the
facts presented as to make them of the greatest
value and
interest
to
persons
connected
with
the
architectural profession.
It seemed advisable, there-
fore,
to exclude
considerable ma ferial
of a general
nature,
but
in
its
place
several
additional
sections
were prepared, based on the professional experience
of
the
author
as
architect and
architectural
illus-
trator and dealing especially with the uses of pencil
in the free-hand rendering of architectural
subjects.
This article, based on the lectures mentioned above,
appeared
in "Pencil Points" from August,
1920, to
December,
1921, inclusive,
in seventeen instalments,
and
met
a much
warmer
reception
than was
ex-
pected by either the author
or
the publishers.
Be-
cause of the rapid growth of the magazine, the back
numbers of each
issue were soon exhausted
it
be-
came impossible
to meet the demand
for the early
installments;
therefore
the
publishers,
taking
into
consideration the fact that the inquiries received were
not
only
from
those
connected
with
the
architec-
tural
profession, but from
artists and teachers and
art
students
as
well,
decided
that
it was
advisable
to
republish
the
entire
series
in
some
permanent
form so as to make
it available to
all.
The present
volume
is the result of
this decision, and as
it now
stands
contains
in
revised
form
the
material
pub-
lished
in
"Pencil
Points."
to which has been added
much
material which was
omitted
from
the maga-
zine
mainly
because
it
approaches
the
subject
en-
tirely from the art rather than the purely architec-
tural
standpoint.
Then,
besides many new
illustra-
tions by
the author drawn
especially
for
this
pur-
pose, we
are
able
to
include through
the
kind
co-
operation of many
well
known
artists,
numerous
examples of
pencil work, showing a wide range of
subject and
great
variety
of
technique.
All
these
various
reproductions
are
presented
not
merely
as
excellent examples of
pencil drawing, however, but
each
is
selected
to
illustrate some principle of com-
position
or some
suggestion
for technique given
in
the
text, thus adding, we
believe,
to the usefulness
of
the whole.
In
preparing
this
volume we
have
presupposed
that our readers would
lie.
in
the main, students of
art
or
architecture
or
some
allied
subject,
on
the
one
hand, and
architects
or
draftsmen,
artists and
art teachers on the
other.
We have endeavored to
offer suggestions of value
to
all these classes of
in-
dividuals and to do so it is plainly necessary to include
much
that
is
too
elementary
for
the
experienced
man and much
that
is
a
bit
too advanced
for
the
novice.
Therefore
let
the
former
omit
or
hurry
over
the
rudimentary
portions and
the
latter
seek
advice from
his teacher as
to
the
parts
best
suited
to his
state of
progress.
For the beginner needs a
teacher and no book or books can take the place of
personal
instruction,
in
fact,
a book
of
this
sort
can
do
little
but
offer
general
instructions
and
suggestions, a
bit of knowledge and
a
little inspira-
tion
;
if
the reader
gains
a
few thoughts that are
new or has ideas which were partly forgotten brought
back to him or
is made to see
familiar things from
an
enlarged
viewpoint,
this work
will
have
served
a useful purpose.

A FIGURE STUDY BY TROY K1NNEY FOR HIS ETCHING "PROVOQUANTE"

SKETCHING AND
RENDERING IN PENCIL
PART
I.
CHAPTER
I.
FIRST CONSIDERATIONS
UNDOUBTEDLY
the
ready
availability
and
low
cost of
the
pencil and
materials needed
for use
in conjunction with
it are
partly
re-
sponsible for
its popularity among artists, while the
ease with which
it can be carried from place to place
and prepared and kept
in condition
for work are
in
its
favor, also.
But aside from these
intrinsic merits of the pen-
cil
itself,
it has other advantages of a different sort,
for instance
its common employment
for writing
and similar purposes has given us all a certain famil-
iarity with
it,
so
that
the
beginner, having become
accustomed
from
earliest childhood
to these every-
day uses to which it is put, finds it a natural and sim-
ple matter to learn to hold and manipulate
it prop-
erly when drawing, which
is, of course, highly im-
portant as
it leaves him free to give his attention to
other
difficulties
less easily avoided.
Yet the advantages we have mentioned, great
as
they
are,
seem
insignificant
when
put
into
com-
parison with
the one
leading
fact which has given
the
pencil
its
place
in
the world
of
art,
the
fact
that
it
is
suitable
for any kind
of a drawing from
the roughest outline sketch or diagram to a complete
rendering of an elaborate subject.
What other me-
dium
is there which
responds
so
readily
to
any
demand made upon
it?
Sharply pointed
it will give
us a
line
as
fine and clean-cut
as that
of the pen
;
bluntly
pointed
it
can
be
used
almost
as
a
brush.
It
will make
strokes
sufficiently
light
and
delicate
or
bold and vigorous
to
suit the most exacting, or
tones
so smooth
that
in them no
trace of any
line
can be found.
It is responsive to the slightest touch,
allowing us
to grade
at
will from
light
to dark or
from dark
to
light.
What
other medium
will do
all this ?
What other medium permits so great free-
dom
in
correcting and
erasing
at any time during
the progress of the work?
What medium permits of
such rapid manipulation when speed
is desired and
still proves suitable
for the most careful and pains-
taking study?
It should not be supposed that
it
is
only in the making of drawings in light and shade or
outline that
it
is of value, either,
for when color
is
desired there are excellent colored pencils to be had
by the use of which wonderful
effects
are
obtain-
able,
either on
white
paper
or
on
tinted
surfaces,
furthermore
light
washes
of
water-color
can
be
run over pencil work
satisfactorily, charming com-
binations of such mediums being frequently
seen.
Nor
should
it
be
forgotten
that
aside
from
all
these various types of work in which the pencil plays
a leading or a most conspicuous part, there are many
drawings
in which
it serves a
less prominent but by
no
means
less
important
one,
for
it
is
employed
with great frequency in the preparation of drawings
to be completed
in
other mediums
;
pen drawings,
for
example,
are
almost
invariably
blocked
out
in
pencil
before
any
ink
is
applied,
while
its
use
is
not infrequent for the same preliminary preparation
for paintings
in wash, water color or
oil as well as
for making the numerous
studies which are usually
done before a
large
or important composition
is
fi-
nally executed.
Therefore, even though the student
intends
to become
a
painter,
pencil
facility
should
prove invaluable to him.
In
fact, practice with this
instrument
helps
greatly
to
fit one
for work
in
all
other mediums
drawings done in fine line train one
for pen-and-ink, broad
line shading being more
like
charcoal
or crayon or brush work helps one
in the
use of these mediums, while pencil shading in mass
or
full
tone
prepares
one
directly
for
painting
in
wash or
color.
With these various
facts before
us,
it
is not dif-
ficult to
see that the
pencil
is an instrument which
no
artist or
art student can afford
to ignore; espe-
cially
is
it of value to the beginner
for as has been
pointed out
it
is hard
to
find another medium
that
approaches the
pencil
in permitting the same speed
and accuracy
in drawing, coupled with ease
in cor-
rection.
It
is unfortunate
if the student allows
his
impatience to attempt work in pen-and-ink or pastel
or water-color or oils to cause him to proceed to the
use of any of these mediums before he has mastered
the
pencil,
for
if he does
so he
will
face unneces-
sary
difficulties.
But
if
the
pencil
is valuable
to the
artist
or
art
student
it
is absolutely indispensable to the architect
and his assistants, for whereas the artist has numer-
ous mediums
from which
to
choose
the
one
best
suited
to
his
particular
needs
or
individual
taste,
the architect has nothing that can take the place of
the graphite point
for a major portion of his work.
What
other medium would answer
for
laying out
his accurate plans and
elevations and
sections, and
what
else would do
for
all the various detail draw-

SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
ings which must
be
carefully made
to
scale? Yet
the
pencil
serves
the
architect
in
other ways
than
these,
for aside from
this instrumental work which
is hardly within the scope
of
this
volume,
many
drawings of a free-hand nature are required, such as
details of carved stone and wood, ornamental iron,
lettered
inscriptions and
the
like, and what
is
still
more
important
the
pencil
is
particularly
valuable
for
making
rendered
presentation
sketches
of
the
kind submitted
to a prospective
client to show how
a
proposed
structure
will
appear when
completed,
these sketches frequently serving to bring new work
into the office.
Then, too, the architect finds a knowl-
edge
of
free-hand
perspective
sketching
of
great
value in other ways,
for he can by means of a few
strokes
of
his
pencil make some
point
clear
to
his
client or express his ideas satisfactorily to his drafts-
men,
or
help
his
contractors
to
visualize
some
matter
not
readily
understood
from
the
working
drawings.
The
architect's
indebtedness
to
this
little
instru-
ment which helps him to get work and to execute
it
is plain then, but
if he
feels a debt to this constant
friend, so indeed should the architectural draftsman
or
student,
for
the
pencil perhaps
offers him more
assistance
in learning architecture and
in advancing
in
this profession than does any other one thing.
For
it
is
natural
that
the draftsman who
gains
proficiency in the use of an instrument so frequently
employed by the architect stands
in
line
for promo
tion,
especially
if he
is able to do
all the free-hand
work which the average draftsman
is
so often un-
qualified
to handle.
And even though a man may never reach a point
where
he
stands out among
his
fellows because
of
his pencil sketches, he can gain much benefit in many
ways
by
practising
sketching
during
his
spare
moments.
Drawing from photographs or
buildings
always
increases a student's knowledge
of
architec-
ture,
but
it
does
far more than
this.
It improves
his powers
of
observation and
retention,
for
he
is
forced
to
observe
in
order
to draw
at
all and
in
drawing he unconsciously assimilates not only knowl-
edge of the buildings drawn, but also a sense of rel-
ative
proportions and
shapes
applicable
to
original
problems
in
design.
The more
such drawings
he
makes,
too, the greater
will
be
his power to visual-
ize
the
appearance
of
a
proposed
building
long
before a single study on paper has been made.
The
ability
to
thus form
in
the mind an image
of
the
completed
structure
is most desirable, but the aver-
age draftsman
gives
so much
time
to working
in
elevation or plan only that he
is
likely to lose
sight
of the
fact that the building
is to be
finally judged
by
its appearance
in
three dimensions and
not by
the drawings from which
it
is
built.
The
drafts-
man who has the power to visualize does not forget
this fact and so makes
all his drawings with greater
intelligence.
There are some men, on the other hand, who are
able to see
in their minds a building exactly as they
wish to erect
it, yet they are unable to freely express
their
ideas on
paper.
To
such men
a knowledge
of free-hand drawing would be of the greatest bene-
fit.
In
fact a man who can sketch well
is able not
only to express
his own thoughts on paper but can
draw
from
a
description
given
him
by
someone
else.
Then
there
are
others connected with the archi-
tectural
profession
besides
the
architect
and
his
draftsmen and
designers who
find a knowledge
of
sketching
of
value,
for
engineers and
construction
superintendents can often explain to others or make
clear
in
their own minds certain obscure points
in
construction by means of quick
sketches.
And
just
as
the
architect and
his
assistants
find
skill
in
pencil
handling advantageous,
so do
those
connected with such professions as
interior decora-
tion
and
landscape
architecture,
and
in much
the
same way
this
is not
difficult to
see.
What
is not
so commonly
understood, however,
is
that
skill
in
pencil
sketching
often
proves
of
practical
value
to
the layman, though he may make infrequent use of
his
accomplishment.
There
are
problems
which
sometimes come up
in
the daily
life of any person
difficult
to
express
or
explain
by
oral
or
written
word but which can be easily made clear by even the
crudest
sketch.
Does
it not seem rather strange, then, when we re-
flect on these various advantages of skill in sketching,
that
of
all
the
millions
of
people
in
this
country
using pencils every day, and of the thousands of men
in
the architectural
and
similar
professions
alone
who work
from morning
till
night throughout
the
year with the
pencil as
their
principal
tool,
that
so
few ever attempt to make anything but the crudest
sort of free-hand
sketch and that among those who
do seriously try
to make
finished
pencil drawings a
still
smaller number have the perseverance to reach
any
real
degree
of
success?
For
taken
all
in
all
there
is much of a
practical
nature
to
be
gained
through
free-hand
pencil
work, and
in
addition
to
this
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
to
be
obtained,
in
fact, the
satisfaction of being able
to draw
well
is
worth in
itself the time spent in acquiring the neces-
sary knowledge.

Chapter
II.
THE ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT
THERE
is
nothing, perhaps, which
so
kindles
the interest and enthusiasm of the student as
to surround himself with the required draw-
ing materials, while even the experienced man who
is accustomed to the everyday use of these accessories
can
hardly gaze upon a new
clean
sheet
of
paper
and
pencils pointed ready
for
his hand
without an
itching
to commence, a desire to
seize a pencil and
he at
it, for there
is something about such materials
to lure one on
to urge one to do
his
best.
In
fact the appeal of
all such things
is so strong
that the beginner
is almost
sure,
unless guided by
his
instructor, to buy too great a variety and quan-
tity of materials and
is inclined to attach too much
importance to them, for important as they are (and
no man
can
do
good work
with poor
tools),
the
truth
of
the matter
is
that few and comparatively
inexpensive
things
are needed
for
such work, and
especially
for
the
earlier problems.
But these few
should be the best of
their respective kinds,
for the
difficulties that beset the beginner are so many and
great
that
it would be a grave mistake
for him
to
handicap himself by using anything
of an inferior
nature, as even the best materials are none too easily
mastered.
If
the
student
has no teacher
to
aid him
in
his
selection he
is usually safe
in securing the standard
drawing
pencils and papers and the
like which are
carried
in
stock by
reliable
dealers
in
artists'
sup-
plies.
After
a
time
he
will
develop
a
liking
for
certain
kinds
for
certain
purposes and
will
even-
tually choose without hesitation the pencil and paper
best suited to the subject to be drawn and the sort
of drawing
to
be made.
And whether one works
with an
instructor
or without,
his personal
prefer-
ences will become more and more marked from year
to year, and the more difficult
it will be for him to
adapt himself to materials with which he
is not per-
fectly
familiar.
This
unfortunately
causes
some
artists of mature years
to heartily condemn every-
thing
to which
they
are
unaccustomed,
which
is
hardly
fair,
for that which
is worthless to one may
be excellent
for another.
After the early problems
are over, then,
it
is often well to experiment
until
a certain
familiarity with
all the standard materials
is gained.
Those which are here recommended will
do for most of the problems of the beginner while
others are discussed
in
later chapters.
Materials
Pencils
Drawing
pencils
are
usually
graded
from
6B,
the
softest
and
blackest,
to
9H,
the
hardest
and
firmest,
with
fifteen
grades
between,
or seventeen
in
all, arranged
as
follows:
6B,
SB,
4B, 3B, 2B, B, HB,
F, H, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H,
7H, 8H, 9H.
Of
these
the
soft
pencils
are
best
suited
to
freehand work, though some papers
de-
' mand much
harder
pencils
than
others.
In
fact,
the
choice
of
pencils
depends
almost
entirely
on
the character of paper to be used, a smooth, glossy
paper demanding
a
much
softer
pencil
than
is
needed
for work on rough paper which
has
con-
siderable
"too'.h."
For
quick
sketches,
one
soft
pencil, perhaps a 2B or B
or HB,
will sometimes
do
for the whole drawing, but a carefully finished
sketch
showing
considerable
detail may
require
as
many as seven or eight pencils grading
all the way
from 3B or 2B
to 4H or 5H.
In such
a drawing
most
of
the work would be done with
the
softer
pencils,
the
harder ones being used
for
the
light,
transparent tones and
fine
detail.
A
little
experi-
menting
will
usually show
what
pencils
are
best
suited
to the paper
to be used and
to
the
subject
to be drawn.
The
fact
that
the weather makes
a
great
difference
in
the
pencils
required
is
not
us-
ually recognized, but
it
is true that pencils that are
just
right on
a dry day
will prove too hard when
the air
is damp and the paper
filled with moisture.
Pencils of different manufacture vary in their grad-
ing so
it
is generally best to use those of one make
on
a drawing.
Cheap
pencils seldom prove
satis-
factory
as
the lead
is variable and often
so
gritty
as
to
scratch the paper.
Paper
Almost any drawing paper
will
do,
but
the choice depends mainly on
the
size and
charac-
ter of the drawing to be made.
For small sketches
it
is best, as a rule, to use smoother paper than
for
large work,
in
fact
it
is almost impossible
to draw
fine
detail
on
extremely
rough
paper.
A
glazed
paper,
however,
is
seldom
desirable
as
the
shiny
surface
is dulled
in an objectionable manner
if the
eraser
is
used.
Sometimes,
however,
very
crisp,
snappy
sketches
are made
on
glazed
paper,
but
a
soft pencil
is required
for such work.
Extremely
rough paper
is occasionally satisfactory for a large
drawing,
but
a medium-rough
surface
is
best
for
general work.
Some tracing papers are
very good
and have the advantage that the sketch can be
first
blocked
out on one
sheet and
then
rendered on
a
second
sheet placed
over
the
first.
The drawings
by the author
illustrating
this
text were made
for
the most part on "kid
finish"
Bristol
Board, which
has the advantage of being
stiff and durable, with a
firm surface.
It
is
often
well
to
have
several
standard
sizes
for
sketch
sheets,
one
small
enough
to
slip
into
the pocket, and one or two larger
sizes.
Drawing
paper of the Imperial size of 22
in. x 30
in. can be
cut without waste to several convenient proportions,
such as 15
in. x 22
in.,
11
in. x 15
in. and 7 l/2
in. x
11
in.
Some
draftsmen
prefer
to have
punched
sheets
to
be
used
in
a
standard
notebook
cover,
8
in.
x
105/2
in.,
being
satisfactory.
The
sketch
hooks and pads
for
sale
in
all
art
stores
are good
for small work.

SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
Erasers
As a rule
it
is best to avoid the use of
erasers so
far as possible,
as erasing often injures
the paper
surface,
but
art gum
or
a
soft
white
eraser
is necessary
for removing construction
lines
and
for cleaning the
sheet.
A
fairly hard
red or
green eraser may be required sometimes for correct-
ing
errors,
and
a
soft
"kneaded"
rubber
is
very
useful
in
lifting
superfluous
tone
from
a
portion
of
a
drawing.
An
erasing
shield
is
an
essential
if changes are
to be made.
Brush
A
soft brush
is needed
for keeping
the
drawing
free from dust as tiny specks often cause
spots and
streaks
as
the
pencil passes over them.
The paper should always be dusted with care after
erasing
is done.
Boards
It
is usually well
to
fasten the drawing
to
a board
of
convenient
size
with thumb
tacks.
Be sure that
the board
is very smooth,
for unless
it
is
so or the paper very
thick,
the grain
of
the
wood may show
in
the
final
drawing.
When
us-
ing thin or medium-weight drawing paper
it
is best
to put an extra
sheet or two under the drawing to
insure a good
surface.
Fixatif
Sketches done with soft pencils rub and
soil
so
easily
after
they
are
completed
that
it
is
customary
to
spray
or
"fix"
them.
An
atomizer
and
bottle
of
fixatif
can
be
obtained
in
any
art
store but
the
fixatif usually
sold tends to turn the
drawing
slightly yellow and
also causes a gloss or
.shine
if
too much
is
applied.
A
French
fixatif
made
for spraying
pastels
has
the
advantage
of
being more
transparent and
of causing
less
shine,
but
is
quite expensive.
Sandpaper Block
A scratch pad of sandpaper
is
essential
as an
aid
in
pointing the
pencils.
These
are
sold
in
a
convenient
form
with
handles
so
attached
as to make their use possible without
soil-
ing the hands.
A
sheet of
fine sandpaper or a
file
may be substituted
for the block
if desired.
Knife
Obviously
a
sharp
knife
will
be
useful
for trimming the paper, sharpening the pencils,
lift-
ing thumbtacks,
etc.
The above materials are needed
for
all problems.
Drawing tables, easels, etc., will be described in later
chapters which take up the kinds of work for which
thev are
essential.

Chapter
III.
OBJECT DRAWING IN OUTLINE
WHEN
one studies drawing he usually does so
because
of
his
personal
inclination,
hence
when the necessary materials have been
se-
lected and prepared he is anxious for his first instruc-
tion, and
if his early problems prove interesting he is
quite
sure
to
become
so
enthusiastic
as
to
make
rapid
progress.
But
this
is
an
age
of
rush and
hurry;
perseverance
and
thoroughness
seem
to
have
been
almost
superseded
by
impatience
and
superficiality.
Therefore
progress,
however
rapid
in
reality, often seems painfully slow
to the begin-
ner, who
is
all too
frequently so blinded by his de-
sire to hasten on to the
sort of thing which
is way
beyond him
that
it
is
hard
for him
to
realize
the
importance
of
thorough
mastery of
the
elements.
If he
is given problems which he considers beneath
him
he becomes
resentful
but
if
he
is
allowed
to
attempt
difficult
subjects
of
his own choosing and
then
fails to get the
results hoped
for he
is apt
to
give up the whole matter
in
disgust,
blaming the
instructor oftimes for his lack of success.
Is
it not,
then,
part
of
the duty
of
the
teacher
to point
out
the reasons why
it
is necessary
for one
to advance
slowly enough
to permit thorough mastery
of each
fundamental as he goes along?
For
if the student
can
be made
to
see
the need
for
first
learning
to
draw simple things
well,
if he can
be brought to
realize that
his progress
will be
all the more rapid
in the end for having done so, problems which might
otherwise prove irksome
will be approached,
if not
with
enthusiasm,
at
least
with
patience
born
of
understanding.
Even
cubes and
cylinders and
pyramids
are
in-
teresting
to draw
if
one
takes
the
proper
attitude
towards them, and there
is often no
better
starting
point
for the beginner than just
this
class
of
sub-
jects.
If we
select a wooden
cube,
for
instance,
stripped
bare
of
everything
which
might
detract
attention from
its simple geometric form, and study
it from various angles and make many
sketches of
it
(as will be explained more at length later on)
its
appearance will be fixed
forever
in the memory so
that one can
recall
it
at any time and
represent
it
on paper.
"But," the student may ask, "what
is the
advantage of spending so long on a simple block of
wood ?
I want to draw ships and
street scenes and
buildings and
not
blocks
such
as
children
use
for
toys."
The advantage
is
clear
if we pause
to con-
sider that most large objects like buildings and trol-
ley cars and chairs and
tables are based,
so
far as
their
general form
is concerned, on
just such
ele-
mentary shapes as cubes,
prisms,
cones and
pyra-
mids.
Once
skill
is acquired in drawing these, a big
step has been taken towards
learning
to do
larger
and more complex
subjects.
If one
starts with
a
cylinder and masters that and then tries
pails, bar-
rels,
logs,
tree trunks, smoke
stacks,
reservoirs and
the
like,
as
well
as
such
architectural
features
as
round buildings, circular towers, columns and arch-
ways, he
will
be
surprised
at the
ease with which
all these
last may be proportioned,
for these things
differ
little
in basic form from the simple cylinder.
If one can draw
in addition triangular and hexag-
onal prisms and pyramids and cones, he can do
all
sorts of roofs and dormers and things of that kind,
as well as innumerable small objects.
It
is
often
advisable, then,
for the beginner
to
start with such simple objects, drawing each one over
and over again, attempting as has been pointed out
above
to
memorize
its
shape
so
that
it
may
be
sketched at any time without reference to the object
itself.
One
will
be
helped
greatly
if
he
studies
along
with his practice in object drawing the principles of
perspective
as
applied
to
freehand
work,
so
the
reader
is
referred
to
Chapter
V,
which
deals
di-
rectly
with
this
phase
of
our
subject,
and
which
should, therefore, be read
in conjunction with
this.
When one has become thoroughly acquainted with
the appearance and with
the methods
of
represen-
tation
of
such
objects
(and
has gained
familiarity
with
the
perspective
principles
involved)
the
next
step
is
to apply
this knowledge
to the drawing of
objects showing
greater
variety
of
form and
sur-
face and
color,
such
everyday
things
as
books,
dishes,
fruit,
or
old
shoes.
Here
the architectural
student may ask why
it
is essential for him to know
how
to draw
books,
for "what have
books
to do
with the sketching of architecture?"
But indirectly
they and kindred objects have much to offer, for aside
from the skill in form representation and the perspec-
tive
knowledge
gained
from
their
study
(directly
applicable to larger problems such as buildings), one
learns also
in the quickest
way
from
these
small
things which
are
easily
seen
as complete
units by
the eye, how to express all sorts of textures of mate-
rials.
When
one
has
learned
to show
the
leather
of
shoes and the
glass
or
porcelain
of
dishes and
the cloth or metal or wood of other objects
it
is not
difficult
for him
to
represent
brick and
stone and
shingles and
slate.
Columns and
balusters and
all
like
architectural
forms have much
the same
play
of
light and shade and gradation of tone, too, as
is
found on dishes and similar objects and
it
is much
easier to draw from these
little things which are near
at hand than from
features
like columns which are
usually
so large
that a confusing amount of
detail
is visible to prove troublesome to the beginner.
Let
him
feel
confident,
then,
that when
spending
his
time as we have suggested,
it will not be wasted.

SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
Arranging
the Working
Space,
Now
if
one
is
to
gain
the
greatest
advantage
from
his
practice,
whether the subject
is a geometric solid or a bit of
still
life, he must seek a place where he can work
undisturbed,
and
must
have
his
equipment
well
chosen and arranged
in a convenient way.
A room where one can be alone is ideal, or where
the other occupants are engaged
in similar pursuits
as in an artist's studio or a class room.
North light
is
desirable,
for
if windows
face the east or south
or west there will be sunlight streaming
in at times
during the day, which
will cause
the shadows and
reflected
lights on
the
objects
to
shift
in
position
and
to change in value constantly.
North
light, on
the other hand,
is
a
sort
of
indirect
light, coming
not straight from the sun but being largely reflected
from the
sky.
It
is more
diffused,
therefore, and
gives
softer and
less changeable
shadows
and
re-
mains more
constant during
the whole
day,
being
not so much affected by shifting in the sun's position
or
by
the
passage
of
clouds.
And
north
light
is
purer in hue, too, less yellow than the direct rays of
the
sun, though
this
is
of
especial advantage
only
when working in color.
Light from too many sources
is disturbing, as
it causes complexity of shadow and
reflection.
It
is
best
to have the illumination from
one window only, the shades being so arranged that
the
light may
be
cut
off
at
either
the top
or
the
bottom
as
desired.
(See
Figure
1,
which
is
de-
signed to show a practically arranged room for this
type
of work.)
Generally
it
is
the
lower
half
or
two-thirds of the window that should be shaded, as
light
from
above
gives
more
pleasing
shadows.
Many
studios
are
for
this
reason provided with
overhead
light
from
skylights
or
dormers, though
for our purposes the upper half or third of the ordi-
nary window will do very well.
The
objects
to
be drawn
should
not be too
far
from this window for
if they are they will not only
lack sufficient light but the shadows will be too much
elongated.
If
rays
fall downward
at an angle of
about 45
degrees
from
the
left they
should prove
satisfactory,
the
objects
being from
three
or
four
to eight or ten
feet from the window.
Object
stand.
There
should
be
some
sort
of
stand on which these
objects may
be
placed
and
usually a small table of average height
(about 30")
will
do
very
well.
One
painted
white
or with
a
white cover
is good.
If a dark table
is used
it will
be necessary
to cover
it with a white or very light
cloth
or paper on which the
objects may
rest and
show
good
contrast.
A
background
of
the
same
material should be provided so that sharp relief can
be obtained, and the surroundings cut off from view.

SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
not prove so comfortable as to invite
laziness.
For
in object drawing
it
is essential that one should
sit
upright all the time.
The chair should be so placed
that the student
will
sit
directly facing the objects.
Easel
or adjustable
draining
table.
An
easel
or
adjustable drawing
table
is
essential on which
the
drawing
board may
rest.
Usually
this
should
be
kept
in an almost
vertical
position
so the sketch
is
at
right
angles
to
the
line
of
sight from the
eye.
If
the
board
is
tipped
in some
other manner
the
paper
will be
so
foreshortened
as
to prevent accu-
rate work, unless one changes
his own
position
so
as to
still view
it
at
right angles.
The type of ad-
justable
table shown
in
the
sketch,
Figure
1,
has
some
advantages
over
the customary
easel,
espe-
cially
for
the
architectural
student,
for
it
can
be
used not only
in a great
variety of
positions as an
easel
but
will
also
serve as a drafting board or
as
a
table
when
placed
horizontally
or
nearly
so.
Easels such as are available in any well stocked art-
ists' supply house will do very
well, however, those
which
permit
of
easy
raising
or
lowering
of
the
drawing
to
any
desired
height
being
the
best.
Whether table or easel
is chosen
it should be placed
slightly
to the
right
of
the
student
as he
faces the
objects, just enough to one side to keep
it from ob-
structing
the
view.
This
position
and
the
height
from
the
floor
should
be
such
as
to make
it easy
to glance from the objects to the drawing and back
again.
These three
things, then, the
stand on which the
objects are to
rest, the seat, and the easel or adjust-
able
table,
are
most
important and
taken
together
with
such
smaller
necessities as paper and
pencil
constitute the essential equipment.
Cases or draw-
ers or
folios
in which new paper, finished drawings
and
the
like may
lie
kept
are
convenient,
and
in
addition
there
should
be some
provision made
for
taking care of the pencils, erasers and knives which
must
be
near
at
hand.
Attachments may
be
pur-
chased
for
the
type
of
table
pictured
in
Figure
1,
specially designed to accommodate such accessories,
whereas the
easel
is
usually equipped
with a
shelf
to
serve
the same
purpose.
Some
of
the
stands
made
for
smokers
are
convenient
if we
substitute
pencils and sandpaper pad for pipe and tobacco. As
an added improvement to the studio a
shelf should
be provided where the drawing may be placed from
time to time for comparison with the objects drawn.
The
top
of
the
cases
shown
in
Figure
1
would
answer
for
this purpose
(these
cases, by
the way,
allow
for
storage of
still-life,
casts,
etc., as well as
books and drawings)
though
a
rest
or
shelf
right
beside
the
objects would
be
still
better.
Students
sometimes have a portable music rack such as musi-
cians use
placed
near
the
object
stand
so they are
able
to
set the drawing
side by side with the sub-
ject
for study and comparison.
If one plans to work by
artificial
light
it
will be
advisable to arrange
it to take the place so
far as
i?
possible of the natural daylight.
The lamp near the
window
in
Figure
1
is an
adjustable
one
of
tele-
scopic nature which
is excellent
for the purpose as
it may be shifted
instantly to any desired
position.
Some
artists
prefer
kerosene
to
electricity,
claim-
ing
it gives a softer light.
The kind of lamp is per-
haps
of
less
importance
than
its
placement, how-
ever, as great care
is necessary to avoid unpleasant
glare
or
reflection.
The
light
should
be
secured
against
so
swaying
or
moving
as
to
change
the
shade and shadow.
And
last
but
not
least
a
wastebasket
proves
a
desirable adjunct to the
studio.
Selecting the Subject.
When
this equipment has
all been assembled and arranged we can
select our
first subject and
start to draw.
But there are va-
rious
kinds
of drawings
of
objects which may
be
made and
it seems advisable to consider these for a
moment
for they are
all
useful, and
one's training
in
still-life
is incomplete until he has done drawings
illustrating each of
these
different
types.
First come the drawings in outline only, in which
special
attention
is given
to correct proportion and
perspective
;
next we have
studies
in
full
value,
in
which
all the tones are worked out with the utmost
care
so that each drawing gives as truthful a rep-
resentation of the objects as
it is possible to get with
pencil.
Then we have drawings in which some tone
is added to outline,
a sort of combination of these
other two methods, and others in which tone
is built
up
by
successions
of
fine
lines
or
broad
lines
or
both.
All
of
these
types
are
careful
studies
but
there are still others in which speed
is a leading con-
sideration, a time
limit being
set before the draw-
ing
is commenced.
These
are
frequently
called
time sketches.
Aside
from
all
these
studies
and
sketches
in
which
truth
is
sought,
drawings
are
sometimes made
in which
the
objects simply serve
as a motive for a somewhat original composition
for
which
a
rather
decorative
treatment
usually
seems
appropriate.
Of
all these various
classes of drawings we
will
discuss
in
the
next
chapters
the
first
two
quite
fully,
the
drawings
in
outline
and
the
studies
in
full
values.
Much
that we
say
concerning
these
will
relate
also to the
others, which
will, therefore,
be more
briefly
described.
So
let us
select our subject and be
at
it.
We have already mentioned that there
is nothing
better
for
the beginner who
is
just ready
to
start
his
first practice than some simple object with which
he is already quite familiar, something small enough
so that
it can be seen easily at a glance and yet large
enough
so
that
little
effort
is
required
to
see
it.
And
it should have a certain amount of individuality
or distinctive character rather than mere prettiness,
for one of the
first
things that we should
learn
is
how to so analyze the subject as to discover its lead-
ing
characteristics, and
record them on paper with
a few deft
strokes.
It should be of a simple color
scheme, too,
for the beginner has enough to occupy
his attention
if the colors are few and these few not
too brilliant and distracting.
To meet these require-
ments common, everyday objects are often the
best
that
we
can
have.
Geometric
forms
have
been
previously mentioned as desirable but as the repre-
sentation
of these
will be
especially
considered
in
Chapter V we
will
turn
to
objects
having
less
regularity or symmetry of
form, such as old shoes
or
dishes.
Bear
in
mind, however, when Chapter
V
is
read
that much
which
is
given
here
relates
as well to the representation of the geometric forms.

OBJECT DRAWING
IN OUTLINE
So
let us
take
as our
first
subject an
old
shoe,
quite
the
worse
for
wear,
for
this
will
give
us
variety of
shape
in abundance
as
well
as
indi-
viduality (for no two old shoes look just the same).
Beginning
the work.
Now
that
our
equipment
is arranged and our subject is selected, we are nearly
ready to begin, but must
first place the shoe on the
object stand in a natural position with the light
fall-
ing upon
it in an interesting way (though the light-
ing
is
less important
for outline work than for the
later shaded studies).
Thumbtack a sheet of paper
about H"xl5" or
larger
to
your
drawing
board
(see
Chapter
II
in
regard
to
the
selection
of
pa-
per)
remembering
that
if
several
additional
sheets
are placed beneath the drawing, the surface will be
better.
Whittle
a medium
soft
pencil
such
as an
HB to a fairly sharp point, and place your chair and
easel in a position which will permit of comfort and
a
clear view
of
the
object and good
light on
the
paper.
Then when
seated
there
are
certain
things
to
l)e decided
before
touching
pencil
to the
paper.
We must determine what sort of a drawing we are
about to make.
Is
it to be in outline or in black and
white?
Is
it
to
be a rough
sketch
or
a
carefully
finished
study?
Are we
to
attempt
to
accurately
represent
the
subject
as we
see
it, every
spot and
line,
every
infinitesimal
detail
that we
are
able
to
discover on
close
search,
or
are we
to work more
for the general impression that one gets on looking
at such an
object
in
the
usual way?
As a
rule
it
seems
best
for
the
beginner
to
confine
his
early
attempts to
outline, getting the main proportions as
accurate as he can, seeking to bring out in his sketch
the
individual
characteristics of the
object.
If
the
drawing
is to be of a shoe,
let
it represent that par-
ticular
shoe and
not some
other.
Perhaps
it may
be
well
if
the
writer
here
digresses
for
a
mo-
ment to relate his own experiences when making his
first
drawing
under
instruction.
It
was
in
the
studio of Mr. Albert
E. Moore at
Portland, Maine
to whom
this volume
is dedicated, and whose in-
fluence
is
felt
in every
page.
The drawing mate-
rials had been prepared and the author was eagerly
waiting
to
see what
the
subject was
to
be.
And
then
it was brought
out,
an
old,
ragged
felt
hat.
And a block of wood a few inches long, and two or
three inches high.
And that was
all.
And the hat
was
raised
at one
side on
the
block and
arranged
to form an interesting composition.
Then the work
was started, the directions being to make an outline
drawing of that hat, expressing its individuality, get-
ting
right
at the
essentials,
considering
the whole
thing in a big way.
A half hour later the drawing
was
finished,
perfect,
according
to
the
personal
opinion
of
its
youthful
author,
an
improve-
ment on the original
in every way.
And then came
Mr. Moore
!
In the light of later understanding his
patience
seems
truly
remarkable.
For
he
pointed
out how
the drawing was wrong
here and wrong
there, was, in
fact, (though commendable for a
first
attempt)
wrong
in
all
its
larger
proportions,
but
especially how
it
failed
to express the character of
that
particular
hat.
So the
sheet was wiped
clean
and a new drawing made, and
again,
until the end
of the morning found a somewhat discouraged youth
whose
pride
in
his newly acquired
materials
had
received quite a setback.
Finally after three or four
half-days' time the drawing was finished (and what
a feeling of satisfaction this accomplishment gave),
the
first of many
similar
studies,
each
of
which
brought added
emphasis
to
the need
of
truthfully
expressing the leading characteristics of the subject
drawn.
We should perhaps try to make clear to the
stu-
dent
just what
is meant by
"truthfully expressing
the
leading
characteristics
of
the
subject."
To do
so takes us back to a consideration of what a draw-
ing
is
or
should
be.
A drawing
is simply an ex-
planation.
The
best
drawings which we have
are
those which
tell their story directly and simply and
which
do
not
confuse
us
with
multitudinous and
irrelevant
details.
It
is
seldom
that
the
artist
attempts
to
tell
in one drawing
all the
facts about
the
subject
represented,
but
the
leading
truths
are
sought
for,
the characteristics which appeal to him
as being the most valuable and
interesting.
Just as
individuals
differ from one another
in
their choice
of
clothes,
so
artists
differ
in
their
selection
and
interpretation of
the
characteristics
of any
subject,
so
if
several
skilled men were to depict certain ob-
jects as viewed from the same point under the same
conditions
the
resulting
pictures
would
be
quite
different,
though
it
is
perfectly
possible
that
all
might he of equal merit and
all considered as equally
truthful;
far more
truthful
than
a
photograph
of
the same objects.
This may sound a
bit strange as
the
student
is
often under the impression
that the
drawing which comes the
closest to a photographic
representation
is
the
best and
the most
true.
Rut
this
is not
so.
The tiny details of nature are with-
out number and
if we study any object minutely we
are almost overwhelmed with the small parts which
close inspection
reveals.
A clear photograph shows
many
of
these
things.
When we
glance
at
an
object in the usual way, however, we are not aware
of each tiny detail for
it
is onlv when we focus our
attention
upon
one
portion
after
another
that we
see the smallest of the visible parts at all,
the usual
impression that we get
is the one which we should
attempt to transfer to our paper
; not a photographic
likeness which seeks and records every
fact.
As the student gradually develops his perceptions
he
will
be
able
to choose
that
which
is
essential
according
to the purpose
for which the drawing
is
made from
that which
is
superfluous,
so that when
we look
at
his drawings we
will
be conscious with
little mental effort of the subject drawn and its prin-
cipal
attributes.
It
is undoubtedly largely this ease
in understanding a good drawing which
causes
us
to
enjoy
it
in
preference
to
a photograph
of
the
same
subject.
So the beginner must strive to retain in any sub-
ject such elements as have the greatest significance,
in
some
cases
even
exaggerating
them,
sacrificing
at the same time some of the lesser truths
if by so
doing the drawing as a whole will be easier to read
or
understand.
It
will
be no
less
honest because
of
this.
To learn what to look for and what to overlook
is as important
as the improvement of draftsman-
ship, and
there
is perhaps no
better way
to
begin
to do
this than
to
start with
outline, as an
outline

OBJECT DRAWING
IN OUTLINE
11
drawing
is
the
simplest
that we can make,
for
as
light and shade
is largely disregarded in snch work,
concentration can
be given
to
representing propor-
tions and
contours.
It
is
for
this
reason
that we
assume
that we
are
to draw
the
shoe
in
outline,
attempting to honestly delineate
it in a simple way.
It
is here that the student,
if
left to his own de-
vices,
will
often make
the
mistake
of
starting
to
draw
at one point
(such as "A,"
Sketch
1, Figure
3)
at
the
top
of
the
shoe, work down
one
side,
completing
the
entire
outline
as he
proceeds,
next
going across the bottom and up the other
side and
finally back
to
the
starting
point.
Should an
ex-
pert
artist
choose
to do
so
he might employ
this
method successfully, but
it
is not to be recommended
to the beginner as
it
is a very difficult way in which
to work,
for however careful one may be in draw-
ing each small portion as he goes along, the larger
forms
are almost sure
to
be wrong, which
in turn
means
that the
smaller proportions are wrong
too,
in relation to one another.
Sketch
1 shows the
in-
correct result that the employment of such a method
is quite sure to bring.
At
first glance
this drawing
perhaps seems as correct and as interesting as doss
Sketch
4, made by the method which we are about
to
describe,
but
its
chief
fault
lies
in
its
propor-
tions,
for
Sketch 4
gives
the
correct shape
of
the
shoe
as viewed from the one
position
from which
it was drawn.
If we start
at "A" and compare the
contour of the shoe
in Sketch
1 with that in Sketch
4,
bit by
bit, we
find them much the same.
That
is
the
danger
of
the
system,
it
leads
us
astray
almost without our knowing
it.
For when we get
to drawing
the
sole and
glance
across
at
the
heel
we find the
sole
is too low, the
sole and
heel com-
ing
to
a
horizontal
line, whereas
at
4,
the
sole
is
higher.
Compare the height of the
toe
in the two
sketches with the table line at the back and note that
this height
in
1
is too low.
Then as we go on up
to the top we
find the ankle much larger at
1 than
at
4.
Now
in drawing a shoe such inaccuracies are
not wholly disastrous but
if the same method were
applied
to drawing the portrait of a person and as
many
mistakes
crept
in, a
correct
likeness
would
surely
fail
to
materialize.
So instead
of working in this wav one should go
at
the
whole
matter
very
methodically.
First
of
all, as soon as the object
is in place and the easel and
chair are
in position, mark the location of the chair
and the model stand on the
floor
in some way.
A
chalk mark around each leg of the easel and of the
chair
will
do
very
well.
Otherwise
it
is
possible
that some change will be made in their position and
even
the
slightest
shift
is
often enough
to
prove
very confusing and cause inaccurate
results.
Then
when you
sit on the
chair,
sit
right
in
the middle
and keep
erect.
This
is most
important.
For
if
you shift a
bit to one side or the other or slump an
inch
or two, the object
will
present quite a differ-
ent appearance
(the change
being
particularly
no-
ticeable when one
is drawing books and boxes and
the
like).
So
all
the while
that you
are working
hold
the same
position.
As
an
aid
to
remain
;ng
stationary some
instructors
go
so
far
as
to
have
the
student
sight across some mark or
point along
the top of the object stand to some coinciding mark
which
can
be made on
the
wall.
Then
the
stu-
dent,
sighting
from
the
first
point
to
the
second
point,
will
establish
his
position
and
if
he
finds
at any time that the points are not in
line, one be-
hind the
other, he
will know <he
is out of
position.
The same marks
will prove useful to the instructor
when he
sits
to
give
criticism,
as they
will enable
him to view the objects from exactly the same point
used
by
the
student
;
in
fact
if
he
is
of
different
height
it may
otherwise
be
very
difficult
for him
to assume the correct position and unless he does so
he cannot give the proper criticism.
As soon as the student has taken
his position he
should
study
the
object
for
a few minutes before
starting to draw.
Notice the general shape of
the
mass,
forgetting the
detail but considering the sim-
ple form.
Compare the height with the width.
Is
the mass taller than it is wide or is the opposite true ?
Is the general form square or round or oval or
tri-
angular?
What
are
its most
individual
character-
istics?
Is
it
flat or rounded?
Are
its edges regu-
lar
or
irregular?
Are
the
surfaces
rough
or
smooth?
When the subject has been analyzed with
the greatest care the next
step
is
to determine how
large the drawing
is to be and to locate the extreme
limits of the object on the paper.
If the subject
is
higher than
its
length
it
is
best
to
place the paper
in a
vertical
position
so that the
picture
space
will
be in proportion to the object
(or objects).
Usually
the size of the drawing will be less than that of the
subject
itself.
Place a
light mark towards
the top
of
the
paper
to
locate
the
extreme
limit
of
the
drawing in that direction, next another for the same
purpose
at
the
bottom,
followed
by
others
at
the
sides.
These marks
are shown
at
1,
2,
3 and
4.
Sketch

Figure

Next
block
out
very
lightly
with a few sweeps of the pencil the
larger propor-
tions,
the
point
barely
touching the
paper
surface.
Now
set the drawing back near the
objects.
Com-
pare.
Is the height
right
in
relation
to the width ?
If
it
is hard
for the student to determine this there
is
a. test which may be applied here which
is com-
monly used by
artists,
not only
in
object drawing,
hut
in
life drawing, nature sketching,
etc.,
namely,
thumb measurement.
Thumb Measurement.
This
test
is
known
as
thumb
or
pencil measurement.
One
eye
is
closed
and the arm outstretched at
full length towards the
object,
the hand
grasping
the sharpened end
of
a
pencil held
at
right angles to the arm (more prop-
erly
at
right
angles
to
the
line of
sight from
the
eye to the object).
The pencil can then be used as
a measure
for comparing width and
height
or
the
length
of
one
line
with
another
(just
as
a
ruler
might be applied directly to the objects themselves),
the thumb
nail being allowed
to
slide along on the
pencil
until
it marks any desired
point.
It
is
best
to take the
smaller dimension
first and use
it as a
unit of measure for the larger.
As the various pro-
portions
are compared
in
this way the correspond-
ing dimensions on the drawing can he tested either
by
the
eye
or by
laying
the
pencil
directly upon
them.
If
they are not
relatively the same the dif-
ferences
will
be
obvious
and
corrections
can
be
made.
The value of this test is lost unless the pencil
is kept
at exactly the same distance from the
eye,

Offering Some Suggestions on Composition, for Use in Object Drawing.

OBJECT DRAWING

so the elbow must not be bent or the body turned
;
therefore, keep the shoulders firm against the chair
back.
At
best this method of measurement
is use-
ful merely as a test as
it
is only approximately ac-
curate, so the student should not employ
it too
fre-
quently but should,
instead, learn
to depend on the
eye,
especially
for the
smaller
proportions.
If the
drawing
is
frequently
set back
near
the
object
he
will soon learn to see and correct his own mistakes.
In making corrections
it
is not always necessary to
erase the
incorrect
lines,
for
if they are very
light
the new strokes can be made a bit heavier and will
be
easily
distinguished.
If
the wrong
lines prove
confusing, however, erase them by
all means.
It
is
not enough
to
compare
the
height
of
the
object with the width, or the relative lengths of dif-
ferent
lines
as
is done by the thumb measurement,
but the slant of the
lines should be studied
also, to
make
sure
that
they
are
pitched
correctly.
Hold
the pencil
at arm's length
in such a position that
it
hides, or coincides with, some important
line in the
object,
then do
the
same
with
the
same
line on
your
drawing.
Or
hold
the
pencil
vertically
or
horizontally and sight across
it at some sloping
line.
Compare
the
angles
formed
by
the
various
inter-
secting
edges,
too, and make
corrections wherever
necessary.
As soon as the main proportions have been prop-
erly established and the
larger
subdivisions blocked
in
and
corrected
in
turn, we
have
completed
the
first
stage of
our work
as
illustrated
in
Sketch
2,
Figure
3.
At
this
time
the
larger
characteristics
or
peculiarities of the subject should be
clearly ex-
pressed.
In
the
second
stage,
pictured
in
Sketch
3,
the
larger
parts
are
still
further
subdivided and more
of
the small
details
are added.
In
this
stage
the
drawing should
be
set back
several
times,
too,
for
comparison with the
subject.
Here,
as
in the
first
stage,
it
is not necessary
to erase
all the construc-
tion lines or incorrect strokes unless they prove dis-
tracting.
This
second
stage
expresses
the
smaller
or minor
characteristics, retaining at the same time
most of
the
larger.
At
this
point
the drawing
is
really
a
construction diagram over which
it
is
in-
tended
to
work.
For
shaded
problems
drawings
are often brought only to
this second
stage before
the values are added.
Now, before going on to the third and
last stage
illustrated
in Sketch 4, get away from the work en-
tirely
for a few moments.
In
fact
it
is
advisable
to
rest the eye every
fifteen
minutes
or
half hour
by doing something
else.
One can even save time
in the end
if he goes to the window and looks out,
or walks about a
bit,
forgetting the drawing com-
pletely.
After such relaxation mistakes will usually
be evident
at the
first glance and
the
brief
respite
will make
it
easier to resume and hold the correct
position.
This
is important.
Every time you take
your seat you must be sure you are viewing the ob-
ject from
the
right
spot
for, as we have
said, the
slightest
difference
in position
will make a marked
difference
in
the
appearance.
In
this
last
stage
remove
all wrong or unnecessary lines. Then partly
erase
with
a
soft
or kneaded
rubber
or
art gum
the correct
lines until they are barely
visible, show-
ing just enough to afford a guide for the final relin-
ing.
A
great
deal
of
thought
should
be given
to
this
last work
for
the
final
line
should
not
be a
perfect and mechanical one
but
should
be expres-
sive of
the shapes and
textures
represented.
For
some parts the pencil will need a rather sharp point,
for others
it must be quite
blunt.
The pressure
should be varied, too, as certain lines need to be so
light and delicate as to be barely visible while others
will be bold and
strong.
In
places
gradation
will
take place from
light to dark or from dark to
light.
No rules can be given
for obtaining satisfactory
re-
sults
;
it
is a matter of taste and
feeling.
But draw
thoughtfully and
observe
before
you
draw.
This
third stage expresses many of the smaller peculiar-
ities of the subject, being a subdivision of the
lines
of
the
second
stage,
carefully
refined,
preserving,
however,
the
big characteristics of the
first
stage.
Table Line.
In order
to make an object appear
to rest on something solid instead of to merely hang
in
the
air
it
is
usually
advisable
to draw a
hori-
zontal line, often called a table line, which frequently
represents
the back
of
the
object
stand.
Such
a
line
gives some
evidence
of
material
support.
If
graded
to
light
as
it
disappears
behind
the
object
or objects,
it will add also to the
feeling of detach-
ment and space.
This line should never be just half
way between the margin
lines.
A second
table
line
representing the front edge
is sometimes advisable.
Margin Line.
A freehand
line drawn an inch or
so from the edge of the paper
all around, thus act-
ing as a frame, adds to many compositions.
Some-
times this line
is carried only part way around as at
"A,"
Sketch
7,
Figure
4.
As soon as the sketch is completed, sign it with your
name, date
it, and put on approximately the amount
of time
required from
start
to
finish.
Then
spray
the drawing with
fixatif,
if you wish, or clip a piece
of paper over
it
for protection and
place
it
in your
folio
or some
safe
place
for
preservation.
Don't
make the mistake of destroying these early sketches,
thinking they are of no value,
for though they may
not be
beautiful
pictures,
it
is
often
both
interest-
ing
and
instructive
to
look
them
over
later,
the
comparison of a number of them done
at different
times
showing
just
what
progress has been
or
is
being made.
When
the
sketch of
the shoe
is
signed and
laid
to one
side
select another
similar
subject and draw
it
in
just
the same way,
striving
to
truthfully ex-
press
the
individuality
as
before.
Proportion
the
object as you
see
it and
not as you think
it ought
to be
there
will
be time enough to use your orig-
inality
later
on,
for
remember
it
is
truth we
are
seeking now,
as
a knowledge
of
truth
is
a
foun-
dation
for
all the
rest
to
follow.
Marginal
Notes
or
Sketches.
When
a
subject
has
been
selected
for
a drawing
it
is often
advis-
able
to make
very quickly a
tiny
sketch
of
it on
the margin
of
the
paper
before going ahead with
the final drawing. A few minutes will do for such a
marginal sketch or note, just time enough to allow for
a blocking
in of
the
larger
proportions,
the main
lines
of
construction.
When
making
this
tiny
sketch one
is observing the subject and acquainting

14
SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
himself with
it as preparation
for the larger work.
Figure
5 shows a number
of
these
trial
sketches.
Time
Sketches.
As
a means
of
acquiring
skill
to
grasp
and
delineate
the
leading
characteristics
of an
object
quickly,
time
sketches
are
valuable.
These are nothing more or
less than drawings done
in a
limited
time, which
is
often
set
in
advance.
For a simple subject to be
left in outline, five min-
utes
is
allowed,
or
fifteen
or whatever
seems
ad-
visable
(this depending
partly on
the
subject and
partly on the
skill of the artist).
As good a draw-
ing
is made as
is possible within the
limits
set.
In
such work
it
is especially important to block out the
main-proportions first, adding as many of the smaller
details as time permits.
Then there
is another sort
of time sketch
(often referred
to as a time study)
in
which
a drawing
is
pushed
to
completion
as
quickly as
is
possible and the required time
noted.
The
speed
and
dexterity
gained
through
all
such
training
will prove
indispensable when
it comes
to
working from the living model or sketching moving
objects.
Animals, people, vehicles, boats and clouds
do not always remain
still to suit the convenience of
the artist.
Although
all this "speed work"
is essen-
tial and a pleasant change from
the usual form
of
drawing where time
is not a leading consideration,
too much of
it leads to carelessness and inaccuracy,
being detrimental
rather than
beneficial.
Alternate
your
problems,
then, making some
quick
sketches
and some painstaking
studies, and
progress
should
be steady and
consistent.
Memory
Drawings.
When
one
has
acquired
a
fair amount
of
skill
doing
the
types
of work
de-
scribed
above,
let him
try
a
few drawings
of
the
same objects from memory,
for the
ability to draw
from memory or the imagination
is a great asset to
the
artist.
When you have
finished
a drawing
of
an
old
shoe,
for instance, done from the object
it-
self,
leave
the
shoe
in
the
same
position
on
the
object stand but hide
it from view, temporarily, with
a cardboard or sheet of paper and lay the study just
finished to one side.
Then on a fresh piece of paper
try
to draw the
object from memory.
When
the
main
lines have been blocked
out,
look
at the shoe
again and compare
your
drawing.
Hide
the
shoe
once more, correct your drawing and push
it nearer
to completion and again compare
it with the object
itself.
Go on
in this way until the drawing
is com-
pleted.
Then try some quick sketches of
the shoe
from memory, looking at
it first until you get a fresh
impression of
it in your mind, next drawing swiftly
and
freely, working for only the larger proportions
and
individual
characteristics.
This
sort
of work
is
of
the
greatest value
in
training one
to observe
carefully and
to
retain
that which
is
observed.
It
may not be out of place to say that the student who
looks at an object for a long time, forming sort of
a photograph of
it in the brain,
is usually better able
to memorize the form than is the student who glances
back and
forth constantly
from
the
object
to
the
drawing as he works,
forgetting the impression of
each
line once
it
is represented on paper.
This
is
only a general
rule, however, and has many excep-
tions as some students have the power to really ob-
serve and memorize more at a glance than do others
in
several minutes.
Outline Drawing of Several Objects.
The draw-
ing of two or three objects instead of one is logically
the next step.
It involves few new principles, though
the matter of arrangement or composition now needs
our attention, for
it is not always easy to choose and
arrange several objects to form a satisfactory whole.
The reader
is referred to Chapter V, Part
II, which
offers suggestions of assistance at this time.
Study
what is said there about unity and balance.
In order
to obtain unity
it is essential that the objects chosen
should
be well
related by
use,
objects
which
we
find associated for one reason or another.
We have
already mentioned that such things as are frequently
found in the cellar or shed or attic often have more
character
than
objects
which
are
merely
pretty.
Objects
that grow
are
often
interesting,
especially
if the forms are irregular.
It
is
not enough,
however,
to have
things
of
a
kind
or
things
associated
by
use
unless
they
also
offer variety of form and surface and texture (and
if drawings
are
to be
shaded,
variety
in
light and
dark).
Little pleasure would be taken
in a sketch
showing several objects of equal roundness grouped
together,
or
several
others
based on
cubes
of
like
size.
Instead we
look
for
dissimilar
forms.
, We
look
for
dissimilar
edges,
too, some
that are
soft,
broken
or
indefinite and some
that
are
sharp and
clean-cut.
An
ink
bottle
with
stationery and pen
might be
pleasingly arranged,
or a
hat and
gloves
and grip, or any of the many combinations to which
we have
referred
at
the end
of
Chapter
IV.
An
enormously
large
object
fails
to harmonize
in
size
with
something
much
smaller
unless
they
are
arranged with the utmost care and even then such
a composition
is
difficult, so too much difference in
form or
size
is
as bad
as too
little.
Thought and
rare must
be used,
then,
in
both
the
selection and
arrangement.
When two or three objects have been chosen place
them on the stand and
shift them about
until they
compose
satisfactorily.
A
view-finder such as
de-
scribed on page 95
in Part
II
will be of use in this
work.
It
is often advisable at
this point to make a
little trial marginal sketch to see how the arrangement
will look on paper.
Then try some different group-
ing of these same objects.
If some object does not
seem to
fit, substitute another
for
it.
Make a new
marginal
sketch.
Go through
this
process two
or
three times and the best arrangement will be found.
Figure
5
shows
at
"A,"
"B"
and
"C"
several
such
sketches
blocked out as a study of grouping.
Considering the fact that
still life objects are always
shown in repose and bearing in mind that a triangle
resting on its base always seems to express this feel-
ing as much as any shape, many compositions of ob-
jects conform to a triangular proportion.
Sketches

3,
Figure
5
and
"1,"
Figure
4,
are
tri-
angular
in
general mass
and
are,
therefore,
rest-
ful.
When a triangle
is placed on
its apex, how-
ever, or any of
its
vertices,
the
opposite
is
true.
The two sketches of the
little toy rabbit in Figure
4
are
shown
to
illustrate
this
point.
At
"A"
the toy seems stationary
; at "B"
it seems to be run-
ning
off the paper, showing
action
rather than
re-
pose, and the latter effect
is obtained mainly by the
position of
the triangular
mass.

one
which
is

Rectangular
compositions
fre-
quently seem
restful; when
using
circular
or
oval
masses care must be taken that the
objects do not
seem inclined to
roll out of the picture.
The more
nearly horizontal the base
is, the
better,
for
if
it
is
too round
in
form
the
objects
give an
impression
of instability, seeming to have a desire to rock back
and
forth or
fall over.
Both the irregular mass at
"A" and the circular mass at "B," Sketch 4, Figure
4,
have an
unstable
appearance,
the
first
seeming
to
rest
on
too
sharp
a
point
at
the
base.
As
a
further illustration of the principle that objects seem
more satisfactory
if resting firmly on some support
we
call
attention
to
the
feeling
of
incompleteness
and
restlessness
that
one
notices
in
objects which
show no portion of their bases.
The vase in Sketch
6
for
instance, disapj>earing behind
the book, gives
us a
sense
of
something
lacking.
Another
point
worth
considering
is
that
objects
should
not
be
placed so far below the eye that they seem to tip vip,
as
this always seems
disturbing.
The
other
sketches on
Figures
4 and
5
explain
themselves, and as experience will soon teach the stu-
dent how
to get a
satisfactory arrangement
of the
objects,
it seems needless
to say more
here.
Once
they
are
in
position
the
outline drawing should be
carried
forward by gradual
steps
just
as we have
explained
for single objects, using care that
in each
drawing
there
is good
relative
proportion
between
all the different objects.
When
it comes to the
final
stage
greater
variety
of
outline may
lie
needed
to
represent the larger number of surfaces and textures.
When
the
student
has
learned
to draw
well
in
outline
it
is time
for him
to
start
his work in
light
and
shade and
this
will
lie
discussed
in
the
next
chapter.
Before turning to this, however, attention
should be called
to a means
of
learning
freehand
work which
is growing
in
favor.
Drawing on
Glass.
If one stands
facing a china
closet or dish cupboard which has glass doors, and
closes one eye, and then takes a lithographic pencil
or china marking pencil he can trace on the glass the
form
of some
dish
inside, and
this tracing
will
be
a correct drawing of the dfsh as
it appears from that
particular point.
Of course,
it
is rather
difficult to
draw
in
this way
well
for
it
is no easy matter
to
maintain
just
the
same
position
throughout
the
work, and
neither
is
it
easy
unless
one's hand
is
well trained,
to
follow
the
outline
with
sufficient
accuracy to produce a perfect drawing.
Nor would
there be any particular advantage
in
being able
to
do
so.
But students who have difficulty in perceiv-
ing
or
understanding
certain
facts
in
perspective
can sometimes find help by using glass, making sure
that
it
is
at right angles
to the
line of
sight from
the eye to the object.
One can sketch on a window,
drawing,
or
more
correctly,
tracing,
buildings
or
trees or any objects in repose which may be
visible
through the glass.
Occasional use of
this method may help the
be-
ginner, but there
is another far more valuable use to
which glass may be put as a drawing
surface, and
with this use every beginner should be
familiar.
A sheet of glass
is placed on the easel or drawing
table
as
a
substitute
for
the
usual
paper,
with
a
sheet
of paper
or white
cloth
beneath
so
the
lines
will be plainly
visible when they are drawn.
Then
the objects are sketched on the glass with the china
marking
or
lithographic
pencil
just as
they would
be blocked in with pencil on paper. When the main
proportions are drawn
as accurately as the
student
is
able
to
get them
the
glass
is
raised
to
such a
position that the drawing comes between the eye and
the
objects drawn, using one eye
only.
When the
glass has been shifted to just the proper position the
lines
of
the drawing should coincide with those of
the object, this method therefore being an excellent
test
for
accuracy.
If
errors
are
noted,
return
the
glass
to the
table and erase the incorrect
lines with
a damp
cloth.
Make the necessary corrections and
test again
in
the same way as
before.
Repeat the
process as often as
is necessary
; then when the pro-
portions are
right wash
off the drawing and
try a
new one
of
a
different
subject.
There
is perhaps no way
in which the beginner
can
learn
to
see
his own
mistakes and
acquire
a
knowledge of perspective foreshortening more easily
than
this, and the use of glass
is
especially recom-
mended to those who are unable to secure the serv-
ices of a teacher.
The glass invented by Anson K.
Cross
is
a
patented
one
having
a
spirit
level
in
the
frame, and
it
is used
in somewhat the manner
described above.
Many well-known artists and edu-
cators advise the use of
this
glass, which has been
introduced
into some of
the leading
schools
of
the
country.
A
crayon
is
especially prepared
for
use
with
it.

Chapter IV.
OBJECT DRAWING IN LIGHT AND SHADE.
WE
NOW come to the making of shaded draw-
ings of objects
in which we wish to repre-
sent
the
exact amount
of
light and
shade
found
in the objects themselves.
In this work no outline will appear for we are to
make as truthful a representation of the tones seen
in nature as is possible with a lead pencil, and nature
shows us no outline.
A
little observation will prove
that we are able to
tell one object from another by
its light or shade or
color.
Most areas of
light or
of shade have clearly defined shapes which explain
to us the forms of the objects and
all these shapes
seem to have boundaries where one tone stops against
another.
In elementary work and
for certain types
of explanatory drawings lines may be used to repre-
sent
these
contours
or
boundaries,
the
light
and
shade
being
omitted
or merely
suggested, and
the
eye
is
satisfied with the
result.
But the
result
is a
wholly conventional one.
Now we must stop think-
ing of
lines but must think
of tones
instead.
We
must learn to think of the exact degrees of light and
shade
found
in
the
objects and
to
represent them
correctly.
We must learn to translate the values of
color
into values of
light and dark.
For the value
of a given color must
be represented by a tone of
gray which has
the same degree of
light and dark
that the color has.
These tones will vary all the way
from the white of the paper to the pure black of the
softest pencil. We have white tones, and light tones,
and
middle
tones and
dark
tones and
black
tones,
and though there are in reality many more than these
five groups
(in
fact
the
1 tones
in
nature are innu-
merable),
it
is best in drawing to simplify the values,
not attempting to break up a tone to express every
slight difference
in value which may be discovered
on close inspection.
For the
first problems
it
is
suggested
that some
object or objects be chosen with
little
color, confin-
ing the choice
to such things as are white
or gray
of black or of dull tints or shades, for with these the
relative
values
can
be
seen
quite
easily.
The
stu-
dent
will
be
helped
in judging a value
if he com-
pares
it with white.
So take a small sheet of white
paper a few inches
in
size and compare
it with the
various
objects
to be drawn.
Is there any tone
in
the objects as light as the paper?
Select the
light-
est tone that you can
find.
You may discover two
tones
of
different color but the same
value.
Now
hold your
sheet of white paper
in bright
light and
compare
its tone with that of similar paper
in some
darker place.
Now take a piece of black paper and
compare
that with
the
objects.
Is there any tone
as dark as the black paper?
Select the darkest tone
that you
can
find
in
the
objects.
Now
place
the
dark paper
in
brilliant
light and compare
its tone
with
that
of
another
piece
of
the same
paper
in
some
darker
place.
Such
experiments
will
prove
that
even
though
a
surface
is
white
it
will
not
always
appear
white,
and
though
black,
its
value
will change
in
effect as
it
is moved from
place
to
place
the
less
light
a
surface
receives
the darker
its values
will seem to be.
It
should
be remembered
also,
that
if we have
two
objects
of
exactly
the
same
form
under
the
same lighting conditions, but one light and the other
dark,
the
darker
one
will
have
darker
values
all
over as
its local color
is added to the shade.
So
the
lightest value on
the objects
will usually
be found
in that one having the
lightest
local color
and
in
that
part
of
it
receiving the
brightest
light
(usually
that
portion nearest the window).
There
are some
exceptions
to
this-;
highly
glazed
dark
objects
will
sometimes
reflect
a
value
so
light
as
to
be
the
lightest
in
the whole
composition,
being
even
more
brilliant
than
the
paper
on
which
the
objects are being drawn.
When we intend to do shaded work in
full values
we prepare
first of all an outline drawing just as was
described
in the preceding chapter, though the
final
accented
outline
is not needed,
instead
the
outline
should
be softened with an eraser
until
it becomes
simply an
inconspicuous
guide
for
the
work
in
shading.
Next we lightly add the contours or boun-
daries of the most clearly defined areas of
light or
shade.
Now we
determine
the
lightest
light and
the darkest dark and make a comparison of the other
values.
Then
sharpen
a medium
soft
pencil
to
a
fairly sharp
point
(a
softer one may be necessary
for extremely dark tones) and we are ready to be-
gin.
There are several methods of procedure open.
Some teachers
feel
that
it
is best to
first draw the
darkest
tone,
then
the
next
lighter, and
so on up
through
the
values,
leaving
the
lights
for the
last.
Others
start
with
the
lightest
tones,
next add
the
grays, working down to the darkest values.
Really
everything depends on the individuality of the
art-
ist and the type of drawing desired.
Assuming that
we
are
to make
as
correct a
representation
as we
know how,
it
will probably be easiest to work over
the whole drawing, not attempting to bring any one
portion
to the proper tone
at
first, but building up
all
the various tones gradually.
In
this way unity
will be obtained.
Set the drawing back
frequently,
and
get away from
it once
in
a
while
for a
few
minutes'
rest.
We have already mentioned
that
as
a
rule
such
surfaces as are receiving the brightest
light
(which
means they
are turned
directly towards the source
of
light),
will be the
brightest.
If we have an ob-
ject which
is rounded in form
(such as a cylinder)
we
will usually
find
it the lightest in value towards
the window.
Those portions which are turned away
from the light will of course be rather dark.
There
may be a gradual change of tone from the
lightest

see

6,
or
if
the
object
has
a
somewhat
irregular
surface
sucli as the decagonal prism, shown
at Sketch 2
in
the same diagram, the values may change gradually
plane by plane from the
lightest plane
to a
slighter
darker plane, to a still darker one, and so on around
to
a point on
the back opposite
the
lightest
plane.
Jt is not always true, however, that the darkest plane
or portion of curved surface will he the one farthest
from
the
source of
light,
for there
is sometimes a
certain amount
of
illumination
from
some
other
direction, and
even
if
there
is
not,
there
are
fre-
cjuently rays of light reflected onto the parts in shade
or shadow, thereby
neutralizing the otherwise dark
values.
Sketches
1
and
3, Figure
6,
will
serve
to
illustrate
this
point
(the reader
is
referred
also
to
Chapter VI, Part
II, on graded tones).
At "1" the
brightest value
is on that portion of the cylinder
re-
ceiving the strongest rays of light.
Then as the sur-
face curves more and more away from the source of
illumination the darker
it
gets.
At "3" a different
condition
exists.
The brightest part of the surface
is at "A" as in "1"; then the tone gradually darkens
until
it reaches "B," which
is the darkest.
Then at
"C" a lighter value is found, caused by the reflection
of
light rays from some other
object.
Planes. Now few objects which we draw have sur-
faces curving as gradually as those of the cylinder
just illustrated or planes so mechanically arranged as
those of the prism.
More often the objects are so
irregular that the
light and shade varies from part
to part
; there may be many portions turned towards
the light and many turned more or less away.
These
various areas
of
light and shade which are seen in
an object, caused by
its irregular form and
its posi-
tion
in
relation
to
the
source
of
light, are
usually
referred
to as
"planes,"
even though
they do
not
fully meet the geometric definition of the word.
Edges
of
Planes.
In
some
irregular
objects
there
is
quite
a
definite
line
of
demarkation
be-
tween the various planes.
In gradually curving ob-
jects there
is no such
line
the tone simply grades
as we have noted
in the case of the cylinder, with
no
sudden,
perceptible
change
in
value.
In most
objects both of these two conditions exist; in parts
the planes seem quite definite, in others they merge
together.
There
is
nothing more
important
than
to draw
these edges
correctly,
sharpening them
or
losing them as the case may
be.
In the same way
there
is great difference in the edges of the objects
themselves as they come
in contrast with the back-
ground
or with
other
objects.
Some
stand
out
in
sharp
relief,
others
are
indistinct.
Some dark ob-
jects become
so
lost
in shadow on their shade
side
that
it
is
hard
to
distinguish
the
form,
hence
it
should not be over-accented
in the drawing.
Sliadoivs.
Shadows out-of-doors and shadows in-
doors
are
entirely
different
in
their
appearance.
In-doors
they
are
softer
and
more
indefinite
;
whereas some edges
of shadows seem sharp, many
are almost
lost.
Hold the end of your pencil on a
sheet
of paper and the shadow
will seem
sharpest
right
at
the
point
of
intersection.
Bear
this
in
mind when shading.
Correctly drawn shadows have
much to do with the
effect of modelling or projec-
tion.
Needless
to
say,
unless
the
objects
are
arranged with care and the whole group well lighted
the shadows may prove very
distracting;
consider-
able experimenting
will
be
necessary to compose a
group
to
the
best
advantage.
If
light
is
coming
from several sources the shadows will surely be un-
fortunate,
for
the complex
forms
cast
in
different
directions will tend to restlessness and confusion.
Now when your drawing
seems
finished
set
it
back
for a
final comparison.
Have you
the exact
degrees of
light and dark
in the drawing as in the

objects themselves?
Have you the correct degrees
of
sharpness and
softness
in
the edges?
Is there
too much dark on one side or at the bottom or the
top,
or does the whole hold together
nicely?
Are
the tones clear and transparent, or heavy and dead?
Have you
succeeded
in
expressing
space,
depth,
weight,
texture?
Have you
practiced economy
of
tone
or
is
the drawing
confusing
because
of
too
many
different values?
Have you
lost the
outline
as you should in drawing in light and shade, remem-
bering that the mere contrast of tones as
in nature
will bring out what you wish to express?
Now
partly close the eyes and study your draw-
ing reduced to
its simplest elements.
Do the nearer
parts seem to come forward properly and the farther
parts
to go back?
If
not,
force the nearer parts a
bit and
sacrifice the distant portions.
We must get
a
feeling
of
projection
and
distance.
Is
there
a
complexity of high light?
If so, tone clown all lights
a
bit,
leaving one
to
be
the
strongest
of them
all,
for
a
picture
is
better
witli
one
lightest
light and
one
darkest
dark.
Too much emphasis
cannot
be
attached
to
the importance
of
studying the
objects
drawn and the drawing
itself through partly
closed
eyes, not only when
it
is completed
but from
time,
to time
as
the work
progresses.
For
in
this way
one
shuts
out
all
but
the
essentials, and
hence
is
not
led
into
complication
and
restlessness
of
ef-
fect.
Now we have said
little about the kind of
stroke-
to be used
for
this work,
for
it
is better that there
be
no
definite
line
showing.
The
tone
should
be
built up by going over and over
it with a compara-
tively sharp
point, merging
the
various
lines
to-
gether
until
they
arc
lost.
Naturally
the
textures
represented
make
a
difference
in
the
manner
of
working,
but
to make
such
studies
of
the
greatest
value each tone should be as nearly perfect as pos-
sible,
the
student
striving
for
transparency
and
luminosity.
The drawing of the apple
at
1, Figure
7, was done
in
this manner.
Sometimes tones are
rubbed smooth with the finger or with a stump, but
this method
has
little
to commend
it
for
this
class
of work.
There
is another type
of shaded
still
life draw-
ing, however, which
is more
sketchily done, where
a few strokes
of
the
pencil are used
to express a
great
deal.
This type of work has been illustrated
in
Figure
7
which
shows
separate
strokes
in
many places rather than continuous tone.
The stu-
dent
should
practice
this
kind of work,
too,
so
drawing the strokes as to best express the surfaces
represented, using some
fine and some broad
lines.
In line work the strokes should as a rule follow the
direction
of
the
surface.
In
types
of work
sometimes
seen
the
still
life
becomes
a
motif
for
a
decorative scheme
or com-
binations of tone and
outline are found,
or washes
of
color are added
to
the
pencilling,
but
there
are
many elementary
text books which show examples
of
such work,
therefore the
interested
student can
find a great deal of material to help him, if he desires
to do
so.
The student's drawings opposite
illustrate
some
of
these
possibilities
for decorative work and
on page 23 is an excellent example of a type of draw-
ing frequently made in which a few very dark, crisp
accents are added
to a clean-cut outline.
Notice the
direct and economical way in which the various ma-
terials
are
suggested,
and
the
commendable
sim-
plicity of the whole.

OBJECT DRAWING BY ETHEL M. WEIR

Chapter V.
FREE-HAND PERSPECTIVE.
OBJECTS
usually
appear
different
in
shape
from what we know them to
be.
or,
in other
words, the appearance seems contrary to the
facts which we know regarding these objects. We are
aware,
for
instance, that a cube has six equal
faces
and
that each of them
is
square.
If we
dra^jt
six
squares,
however,
or
a
smaller
number,
combin-
ing them
in any and
every possible way,
the
final
result will certainly not give us the same impression
as
the cube
itself.
We
also know
that the top
of
a
right cylinder
is a
circle, yet
it
is seldom indeed
that we see a cylinder in such a position that the top
appears as a true circle.
We think of
it as a circle
simply because we know
it
to be one
;
not because
it seems
really
circular,
for unless we look straight
at
the
end
of
the
cylinder
it appears
elliptical
or
even
as a
straight
line.
So when we are in doubt as to how things should
be drawn
in order
to have them look
right, we not
only
study
the things themselves but we
also turn
to
the
science
of
perspective which
gives us
prin-
ciples that are helpful to us in drawing objects cor-
rectly,
not
as they
actually
are, but as they appear
from the point from which they are viewed.
Free-
hand perspective trains us
especially
in the applica-
tion of these principles to the practical problems of
free-hand
sketching.
For
the purpose
of
this book
it seems
desirable
to discuss very
briefly only a few of the more im-
portant
of
these
principles.
Nothing
short
of
a
complete
volume
could
do
justice
to
the
subject,
and as there are already many excellent works avail-
able
it seems needless
to duplicate here that which
has
already
been
so
successfully
and
completely
handled
elsewhere.
The
reader who
really
desires
to thoroughly master
the
subject should read some
such book as "Free-hand Perspective and Sketching"
by Dora Miriam
Xorton,
not
forgetting,
however,
that
the
reading
itself
will
do
little
good
unless
sketches
are made
to
illustrate
each
point
as
the
student
goes
along.
And
one
should
learn
to
be
observing
of
the
perspective appearance
of
objects
all about him;
if he
is studying circles and
ellipses,
let him take
notice of every circular arch, or clock
face, or barrel, or other similar form which he sees.
Now
fundamentally
these
principles which have
to do with
the appearance
of
things are
few, and
among
them
the
following
are
perhaps
the
most
important.
First, the apparent
size of an object decreases
in
proportion
to
its
distance from an imaginary plane
which passes through the eye at right angles to the
direction in which one
is looking.
Second, a surface appears
in
its true shape only
when parallel to this plane, or, in other words, when
at right angles to the line of sight from eye to sur-
face.
This first principle can be easily tested if one stands
close to a window and looks
straight through
it
;
an
entire building
in
the
distance
will appear only
a few inches
in
size on a single pane of
glass.
If
there
are
several
objects
of
equal
size
at varying
distances
from
the
eye
it
will
be
noticed
that the
nearest one appears to be the largest and the others
seem smaller and smaller
in proportion to their dis-
tance away.
By way of
illustration of
the second
principle
it
will be easy for the student to demonstrate for him-
self
that when a surface
(take a circular end of a
cylinder,
for
example)
is
not
so
placed
as
to
be
at right angles to the line of sight
it appears smaller
in one dimension because of being turned away, and
the
farther
it
is turned
the
smaller
this dimension
seems, until when turned so far as to cause the sur-
face
to coincide with
the
direction
of
sight
it
will
appear simply
as
a
line.
This apparent change of
shape
is
called
foreshortening.
Now
in
order
to
give
a working knowledge
of
the
application
of
these
principles
in
the
quickest
and most direct way we will discuss the appearance
and methods of representation of a few typical geo-
metric
forms.
Flsewhere we have
explained
that
once
the
simple
forms
are
understood
it
will
not
be
difficult
to do
objects which
are more complex,
applying exactly the same principles.
The
Horizon
Line
or
Eye
Level
This
is
an
imaginary
horizontal
line
at
the
level
of
the
eye.
In
object drawing
or
other
small work,
the
latter
term
is the more commonly used
; for buildings and
outdoor vork
in
general, the former
is customary.
The appearance of any object will vary according
to whether
it
is
at or above or below the eye
level
and
to
the
right
or
in
front
or
to the
left
of
the
spectator.
To observe just what variation does take
place
in
the appearance
of
objects as viewed from
various
points,
it
is
advisable
for
the
student
before doing any drawing, to take simple things and
to hold them in different positions, noticing just how
they
look when moved from place
to
place, nearer
or
farther
from
the
eye
and
higher
or
lower
in
relation
to
the horizon
line.
The Sphere
Take,
for example, a sphere, or an
apple
or orange
or some
other
object
of
spherical
form.
When
held above
the
eye
it appears
as
a
circle.
below the eye and
at the eye
level
its con-
tour
is
practically the same.
If
it
is a true sphere
there
will
not
be
the
slightest
variation.
If we
take an apple, however, with the stem at the top, and
hold
it level but below the eye, not only
is the stem
visible but
so
is a portion of the surface beyond
it.
If we
raise
it
until the
top
of
the apple
is
at the
height of the eye,
still holding
it
level, the stem
is
still seen but none of the surface beyond
is
visible.
A bit of the "blossom" below may now show. As we
raise
it above the eye the stem
will gradually
dis-
appear as
will a portion of the top
surface, and as

this
is
lost to view more of the lower part will be-
come visible, so
if
it
is held some distance above the
eye we will see the entire "blossom" and the surface
beyond.
In other words, whereas a sphere remains
the same in profile regardless of
its position, we see
different portions
of
its
surface
as
it
is moved up
and down, and the same
is
true
if
it
is
shifted
to
the
right
or to the
left, or spun round and round.
Sketch
1,
Figure
8,
illustrates
this
point.
Study
this and then draw several objects of spherical form
placed
in a variety
of
positions.
Attention
should
lie
called
to
the
fact
that we
seldom
see
half way
around
a
sphere.
Sketch
2
perhaps explains
this more
clearly.
If "X"
repre-
sents the top view of the sphere and "Y" the posi-
tion
of
the
spectator,
the
lines drawn
from "Y"
tangent
to
the
sphere, mark
at "A"
and
"B"
the
limits
of
the
visible
portion
of
the
sphere
at
the
plane of
its greatest circumference.
The larger the
sphere
or
the
closer
the
spectator
the
smaller
this
distance becomes.
The Cylinder, Vertical
Now take a right cylinder
and hold
it vertically, and with one eye closed raise
it
until the top
is
level with the other eye.
In this
position the top circle
will appear as a straight
line,
the
circular
plane
being
so
greatly
foreshortened
that only
its edge can be seen.
Now lower
it a
bit.
The
circular
top
is now
visible
but
still
so much
foreshortened
that
it
is
elliptical instead of
circular
in
appearance.
Lower
it
still
farther
and
the
rounder the
ellipse becomes.
Now
just as
this top
ellipse appears rounder
as
it
is dropped
below
the
eye.
it
is evident
that
if the bottom of the cylinder
could
be
fully
seen
it
would
appear
still
rounder
than
the
top.
as
it
is
even
farther below
the
eye.
Experience
will prove that the degree of roundness
of
the
ellipse
will
be
in
proportion
to
its
distance
below
the
eye.
Next
raise
the
cylinder
vertically
until
the
lower
end
is
at
the
eye
level;
this now
appears
as a
straight
line
just
as
did
the
top end
before.
Raise
it
still higher and the bottom comes
in
sight as an
ellipse, the top of
the cylinder being
now hidden.
And the higher the cylinder
is raised,
the rounder
the
ellipse
of
the bottom becomes,
its
fullness being in proportion to
its distance above the
eye
level.
If the cylinder
is lowered
until
the bot-
tom
and
top
are
both
equi-distant
from
the
eye
level both
will be
invisible
but
the
visible edges of
each
will
have
like
curvature, and
if
the
cylinder
were transparent
so both the top and bottom could
be
seen,
the
ellipses
representing
both
would
be
identical
in
sixe and
shape,
as
both
circles
are
the
same
distance from the
level
of
the
eye.
Transparent cylinders of glass are convenient
for
such experiments
or
the
student
can make one
of
celluloid
or some
similar
material.
What
is true of the perspective appearance of the
top
or
bottom
of
a
cylinder
is
true
of any
circle,
and
if the student wishes
to prove
this,
let him cut
a
circle from a sheet of heavy paper
or cardboard
and experiment with
this.
When held
horizontally
and level with the eye does
it not look like a straight
line?
And when raised above or dropped below the
eye
level
does
it
not appear
as an
ellipse?
Note
the apparent change in roundness of this ellipse and
in the length of
its short axis as the circle
is raised
or lowered.
Only the long axis will appear of the
same proportionate length regardless of the position
of the circle.
Is
it not true, also, that when a circle
appears as an
ellipse
the
ellipse
is always perfectly
symmetrical about
its long and short axis
lines, and
is
it not divided by these axis
lines into four quar-
ters which appear exactly equal?
Go
back
to
the
cylinder
again and
see
if
this,
too, does
not, when
held
vertically,
appear
sym-
metrical about a vertical central axis line at all times,
every element of the
cylindrical surface being ver-
tical also?
As in the case of the sphere we seldom
see
half way around the circumference; hence
less
than
one-half
of
the
cylindrical
surface
is
visible
at any one time.
Now
try
a number
of
sketches
of
the
vertical
cylinder
and
the
horizontal
circle
as viewed
from
different positions
(Sketch 3 shows a few).
Prac-
tice
drawing
ellipses,
too,
until
you
can
do them
well
; this
is no easy matter.
The tipped or horizontal cylinder will be discussed
later.
The
Vertical Cone
While we
still have the hori-
zontal
circle in mind
let us consider the right circu-
lar cone placed
vertically.
Sketch 4 shows the cone
in
this
position.
It
will
be
seen
that
the
appear-
ance of the
circle
is the same as
in the case of the
cylinder.
Also that
if the apex of the cone
is at the
top and
the cone below the
eye, we can
see more
than half way around the conical surface.
If raised
above
the
eye we
see
less
than
half way around.
And
if
the
cone
is
inverted
the
opposite
is
true.
Note also that a right
circular cone will always ap-
pear symmetrical, the long axis of the ellipse of the
base being
at
right
angles
to the axis
of the cone.
Make
several
drawings
of
the
vertical
cone;
the
horizontal
or tipped cone
will
be discussed
later.
The Cube
in
Parallel Perspective
We now turn
to
the
cube.
Hold
it with the top
at the eye
level
and
the
nearer
face
at
right
angles
to
the
line
of
sight
so
it
is seen
in
its true shape.
Only one face
of
the
cube
is
visible
now, and
that appears
as
a
square.
Lower
the cube a few
inches and the top
appears,
greatly
foreshortened.
The
farther
hori-
zontal edge, being a greater distance away than the
nearer one, seems the shorter of the two.
The par-
allel
receding edges
of
the top seem
to
slant.
If
these
slanting
edges
were
continued
indefinitely
they would appear to meet at a point and that point
would
be on the eye
level.
Lower the cube a few
inches
farther.
The
top now
appears
wider
and
the two receding edges have
still greater
slant.
If
continued
they would
still meet
at
a
point on
the
eye
level,
the same one as before.
The
front
face
still appears square.
Now
raise the cube above the
eye,
still
holding
it
vertical.
The top goes out
of
sight and
the bottom becomes
visible.
The
front
face
looks
square
as
before.
Now
the
higher the
cube
is raised the more the bottom shows.
The re-
ceding
1
lines now seem
to
slant downward towards
the
eye
level;
if
continued
they
would
meet
the
very same point on the eye
level as when the cube
was below the
eye.
Now in order to convince yourself that these same
facts are
true
of
other
objects,
take
a box
or any
form
similar
to
the
cube, and
study
it
in
various

FREE-HAND PERSPECTIVE
27
horizontal positions above and below the eye, keep-
ing
the
nearest
vertical
plane
so turned
that
it
is
always seen
in
its true shape.
When the object
is
below
the eye do not
the
horizontal
receding
lines
seem
to
slant upward with an appearance
of
con-
vergence?
And when
the
object
is above
the eye
do not these horizontal receding lines seem to slope
downward
in the same way?
And whether above
or below the eye
is
it not true that
all the horizontal
surfaces
appear
to
slope towards
the
eye
level as
they recede?
It
is interesting to note as mentioned
above
that such
parallel edges as
recede would,
if
continued
far enough, appear
to converge towards
the same point on the eye level, exactly opposite the
eye
itself, this being termed the vanishing point for
that
set of
edges.
Such
edges
as
do
not
recede
have, of
course, no appearance of convergence and
hence no vanishing
point.
All the time that you are studying the object ask
yourself such questions as the following, for
it
is by
personal
observation and
analysis that one can best
gain a knowledge of perspective appearances.
Is
it
true
that every
set
of
parallel
receding
horizontal
lines has a common
vanishing
point
of
its
own?
And that of two parallel lines of same length which
do not recede the one nearest the spectator appears
the longer?
And
that any
parallel edges which are
at
right
angles
to
the
line of
sight
actually appear
parallel ?
When an
object
is
placed
like
the cube
or
bos;
which we
have
mentioned,
so
its
principal
face
is
at right angles to the line of sight from the eye, we
say that
it
is viewed
in parallel perspective.
Sketch
5 shows cubes in parallel perspective in various rela-
tions to the eye
level.
The Cube in Angular Perspective
We now pur-
pose
to turn
the cube
into a new
position,
placing
it
in
a horizontal manner below the eye and turned
at an angle with
all
four
of
the edges
of
the
top
receding.
None
of
the
edges now
appears
hori-
zontal.
Now
sketch
the
to])
of
the
cube
in
this
position.
It
will
be
noticed
that
if
the cube
is
so
turned as to make equal angles with the line of sight
as
at
"A,"
Sketch
6,
Figure
9, we
will
see
equal
portions of the
lines marked "a" and "b" and they
will
have
equal
slant.
The
same
will
be
true
of
"c" and
"d."
Now
if we turn
the cube
so
that
it
makes unequal angles with
the
line of
sight,
as
at
"B,"
Sketch
6,
we
find
that
line
"a"
will
seem
shorter and
line "b" longer than before.
Now
to more
firmly
fix
these
thoughts
in
vour
mind
shift the cube from
place to place and ques-
tion yourself in this way.
If two edges of the square
top of the cube recede from you
at unequal angles,
which
of
the two appears the longer?
Which the
more nearly horizontal ?
And considering the com-
plete cube, turned
at an angle
so that two or more
of
its faces are visible, can any one of these appear
in
its true shape ?
Will
all
parallel edges receding
towards
the
left
appear
to
converge
or
vanish
to
one point and
those towards the
right
to another?
And
if so will these points be on the eye level?
Continue your analysis
in this thorough way and
you will observe many interesting things.
You will
see that such edges of the cube as are truly
vertical
appear so and hence should be drawn
so.
You will
notice
that the
nearest
vertical
edge
will
be
the
longest and
that
the others
will decrease
in length
as they get
farther away.
When
a cube
or
other
object
is
so
placed
that
no surface
is seen in
its true shape, or that its prin-
cipal planes are at other than a right angle with the
line of
sight,
it
is said to be in angular perspective.
As
it
is
rather
difficult
for
the
beginner
to draw
in angular perspective well, he should work for some
time from a cube
itself, placing
it
in different posi-
tions above and
below
the
eye.
In drawing such
an
object
it
is
usually
advisable
to
actually
locate
and draw
a
line
representing the
level
of
the
eye
on the paper, making sure that the various receding
lines are converging to the proper vanishing points
on
this
eye
level.
It
is
sometimes
wise
in
these
early
problems
to
actually
continue
such
receding
lines indefinitely, allowing them to meet at the proper
points,
as
at "C" and
"D,"
Sketch
6.
As an
aid
in testing
for correct drawing of a cube in angular
perspective
it
is
occasionally
helpful
to draw
diag-
onal lines on the top foreshortened square as we have
done with the dotted
lines at "A" and
"I?," Sketch
6.
At "A"
with
the cube
turned
at
equal
angles,
the
long
diagonal
is
horizontal,
the
short
perpen-
dicular.
Let the cube be swung around as at "B,"
however, and the diagonals immediately
tip.
Point
"g"
drops
lower
than
"e," and
"h" moves
to
the
right
of
"f"
instead of remaining above
it.
If the
vertical
faces
are
turned
at
unequal
angles,
then,
we not only
see more
of one than of the other but
the diagonals of the top plane will always be tipped;
never
vertical or horizontal.
Rules of
this
sort are
of comparatively
little help, however; the thing that
counts
in
all
these
objects
is
the
observation and
practice
from
the
things
themselves.
The Cylinder, Not
Vertical
Now that the draw-
ing of the cube has given one a
little knowledge of
receding
lines,
it
is well
to go back to a considera-
tion of the cylinder, only this time we will not place
it
vertically.
Hold
it, instead,
in
a horizontal posi-
tion
at
the
level
of
the eye
("closing one eye)
and
turn
it
so
that the
circular end appears
in
its
true
shape.
In this position nothing
is seen but the end.
If we then swing
it
or
tip
it
so
that
the end
a.nd
some of the curved surface are both visible, the end
will
appear
as an
ellipse.
The
less
of the curved
surface shows, the rounder this ellipse will be. Then
swing the cylinder
until one end appears a
straight
line.
In
this position the other end
is invisible but
if the cylinder were transparent
it would be found
that
this
end
would
appear
as
an
ellipse.
Study
the cylinder in
all sorts of positions above and below
the
eye,
making
observations
of
this
sort.
Such
study and comparison will prove that the right cylin-
der, regardless of position,
will always appear sym-
metrical about
its long axis
line
;
that the long
di-
ameters
of the
ellipses forming the ends
will be at
right
angles
to
the axis
of
the cylinder.
One
will
notice,' too, that
it
is never possible to see quite half
way around the cylindrical
surface.
And when the
farther end
of
the
horizontal
or tipped cylinder
is
a greater distance from the eye than the nearer end
it will appear smaller, which means in turn that the
elements
of
the
cylindrical
surface
will
appear
to
converge, and
these elements being
all
parallel
lines

28
SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
they
will seem
to vanish towards a
point.
If
the
cylinder
is placed
horizontally this point
will be on
the eye
level
;
i f
tipped
in some other
position the
point will he ahove or below the eye.
To this same
vanishing
point
the
axis
of the cylinder
will
also
recede
if produced.
And
it will be noticed, too. that
regardless of
the placing of the cylinder those ele-
ments of the surface which form the straight boun-
daries will appear tangent to the curves of the bases.
At "A," Sketch 7, the cylinder has been drawn with-
in a square prism.
To do so gives one a knowledge
of
the
relationship
between
objects
based
on the
square and the
circle.
The Conr.
Tipped
And
if we turn
to the cone
once more for further consideration and look directly
at
its apex we
will
find
that
it appears
as
a
true
circle.
And when
so
held
that
its
base becomes a
straight
line
it has the contour of a
triangle.
The
visible
curved
surface
of
a
cone may
range
from
all
to
none.
The bounding
elements
of
the
cone
are always
represented by
straight
lines tangent
to
the ellipse which represents the base.
And the right
cone,
like
the
cylinder,
will
always
appear
sym-
metrical,
being
divided
by
its
long
axis
into
two
equal
parts.
Study the
little sketches of -cylinders and cones
in
Sketch
7, Figure
ll
Then make many of your o\vn.
Now in just the same way consider other geometric
forms,
such
as
the
triangular
prism
placed
verti-
cally and
horizontally,
and
the
pyramid
and
the
hexagonal prism
in
various
positions.
Though our
space does not permit
full discussion of these here,
it
seems
essential
to
call
attention
to
a
few
facts
in
regard
to
the
appearance
of
the
triangle,
the
hexagon,
etc.
Rut
first,
let us say another word or
two about
the
square.
\Ye have drawn
a square
at
Sketch
8
and
have
crossed
its
diagonals.
Doing
this
locates
the true center of
the square "o"
as
it
appears
in
perspective.
It
seems
more
than
half
wav back,
for the
farther half of the square, being
a greater distance from
the eye than
the
first
half,
seems
smaller
For
the
same
reason,
liiu-
"bo"
seems longer than "od," though in top view we know
they would be equal.
This will perhaps make more
clenr
the
fact
that
equal
distances on any
receding
line seem
unequal, the
farther seeming the
shorter.
Xow suppose that at the end of this square we draw
a
triangle, as
at "R," Sketch
8. locating
its apex
b\
drawing a
line horizontally from center "o"
to
line
"be,"
erecting
a
vertical
altitude
at
the
point
of
intersection
"tY"
choosing
point
"e"
arbitrarily
on
the altitude and then drawing "ec" and "eh."
This
triangle
illustrates the truth that the apex of a ver-
tical
isosceles or
equilateral
triangle having a
hori-
zontal base appears
in a
vertical
line erected
in the
perspective
center
of
the
base.
As
it
is
easier
to
judge the correct proportion of a square in perspec-
tive than of a triangle, a square
is sometimes drawn
first as a guide as
in Sketch
0.
At
Sketch
10 we
have shown a hexagon.
It
will
lie noticed
at "A"
that the two short diagonals "hf" and "ce" and the
long diagonals
"lie" and
"cf"
divide long diagonal
"ad" into
four equal
parts.
For in a correct draw-
ing
of
a hexagon
it
is always
true
that any
long
diagonal when intersected by two short and one long
diagonals
will
lie
divided
into
four
equal
parts.
\Yhen a hexagon
is sketched
in parallel perspective
as at "B" they
all appear equal.
Now
in drawing
polygons, especially those which are regular such as
the hexagon
just
mentioned,
it
is
often
easiest
to
first draw
an
ellipse
representing
a
circumscribed
circle.
In drawing the decagonal prism
in
Figure
6,
for
instance, an
ellipse was
first drawn
just as
for the cylinders, then the decagon was drawn within
it.
So try a number of polygons, and
later prisms
and pyramids
built upon polygonal
bases.
Concentric Circles
Even in so brief a treatise on
perspective
it seems necessary
for us to make some
reference to concentric
circles, as they must be
fre-
quently drawn and as they often cause trouble.
Stu-
dents sometimes are under the mistaken impression
that
circles
in
perspective
do
not
appear
as
true
ellipses.
They argue that as the nearer half of the
ellipse
is not so
far from the spectator as the other
half
it appears larger and hence must
lie drawn
so.
\Yhereas
this may sound
logical on the
face of
it,
it
is
not
true.
For
if you
test
actual objects yon
will
find
the
circles always appear in perspective as
true
ellipses.
\Ye
can
make
this
more
clear by
referring to Sketch
11.
\Ye have already mentioned
that one cannot see half way around a cylinder.
At
"A," we
have drawn
the
top view
of
a
cylinder.
The spectator
is standing at "s."
Lines of tangency
from
"s"
to
the
cylinder
give
us
at
"1" and
"2"
points representing the extreme
limits of the cylin-
drical
surface
visible
from
"s."
If we draw
a
straight
line
across
from
"1"
to "2"
it marks
tin-
greatest
width
of
the
cylinder
as
it appears from
"s."
This
line really does not pass through the true
center
of
the
circle,
represented
at
"o." but
is
be-
tween
this
center
and
the
spectator, and
becomes
the major axis of the
ellipse representing the circle.
The shaded portion back of
this
line on the sketch
will appear from "s" exactly the same
size at that
portion
left
white
;
hence
the
ellipse must
appear
truly symmetrical about this
line.
At "B" the spec-
tator
stands
closer, and
sees
less of the
cylindrical
surface.
Xow
suppose
we
have two
concentric
circles
representing
the
tops
of
two
concentric
cylinders
as
indicated
at
"C."
the
spectator
still
standing
at
"s."
If we
treat
these
independently
as
before,
drawing
tangents
to
the
curves,
these
tangents will measure off visible surfaces from
1 to
_'
on
the
larger and
from
3
to
4 on
the
smaller.
This shows
that the eye
will
see relatively more of
the cylindrical surface of the smaller cylinder.
Line
3-4
is nearer the center "o" than
line
1-2 but does
not
pass through
it.
Xow the
easiest way
for the
student
to draw
such
circles
in
perspective
is
to
assume that they are inscribed in squares.
At "D"
two squares having a common center are shown in
perspective.
The
crossing
of
the
diagonals
gives
us the
true center
of
the
circle
at
"o,"^ correctly
located
in perspective.
At
1.
2. 3 and 4 are points
through
which
the
larger
ellipse must
pass.
Line

SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
Study
these
circles
at "D" and examine
objects
in which
other
concentric
circles
are
found.
Is
it
not true that foreshortened concentric circles appear
as ellipses?
And would not the short axis lines of
these
ellipses
coincide?
It
will
he
noticed,
too,
at
"D," that distances 3-7, 7-0, 0-5 and 5-1 on the short
axis
seem
to
decrease
gradually
though
actually
the same as the un foreshortened
distances
on
the
long
axis,
2-6,
6-0,
0-8
and
8-4.
So
in drawing
such
ellipses remember
to have
the
space between
them
widest
at the ends
as
at
2-6 and
8-4, and
a
little wider between the near curves as
at
3-7 than
at
the
farther
side
as
at
5-1.
When one
feels able to do
all the more common
of
the
geometric
forms
individually
in
every pos-
sible position
let him draw combinations of
several.
This work should be
followed by a practical appli-
cation
of
the same
principles
to
the
drawing
of
objects
of
all
sorts
and
sizes
based on the
same
forms, as discussed in the chapter on object drawing.
And as one draws he should analyze and memorize.
And one
should
attempt
to make
free-hand
per-
spective
sketches
from memory
or
the
imagination
or from actual working
drawings
prepared
instru-
mental!}' such as a
front and
side and top view.
In
the
chapter
on
object drawing some
of
the
advantages
of
studying
certain
things by drawing
them on
glass have been
pointed
out and we have
also described the glass invented by Mr. Cross spe-
cially
for
this purpose.
Either the common
or the
patented glass might be of great help to the student
in
his
perspective
studies,
particularly
if
this
sub-
ject proves
difficult.
Training
in
instrumental
per-
spective,
is
often
of
help,
too. though
instrumental
perspective
sometimes
shows
apparent
distortions
which
mislead
one.
A
certain amount
of
help
is
gained
from
it.
however,
and
students
who
arc
familiar with the instrumental work usually advance
more rapidly in free-hand work because of the train-
ing.
Likewise
the
student who
understands
free-
hand
perspective
will
find
a great
deal
in the
sub-
ject
to help him
to do instrumental problems more
artistically than
he otherwise
could.
We have
several
times mentioned
that once
skill
is gained
in drawing cubes and
other simple forms
such as we have
just described,
it
is not
difficult to
apply the knowledge acquired
to the
representation
of more complex
subjects.
The architectural
student desires
to sketch
build-
ings and
so
let
us
consider
the
application
of
the
principles stated above to work of
this nature.
Let
us assume that we are to draw a house,
for
example, which
is twenty
feet wide and
forty
feet
long, and twenty
feet from the ground to the eaves,
the
house
being
so
turned
that we
look more
di-
rectly
at
the long
face than
at the end.
The land
is assumed
to
be
level.
At
Sketch
1,
Figure
10,
such a house has been drawn.
As the eye
is usually
from four to five feet above the ground, the horizon
line has been drawn one-quarter of
the way up on
the
building.
The
nearest cube was worked
over
first until
its proportion and perspective convergence
seemed satisfactory.
Then lines "D" and "E" were
produced
indefinitely
(See
"A,"
Sketch
1)
and
a
diagonal
line AC was
carried
through
point
"R,"'
exactly half way from the ground to the eaves, thus
automatically marking off at "C," the end of a sec-
ond cube.
When the two cubes were completed the
roof was added.
By crossing the diagonals of the
square
ends
of
the
house
proper,
centers
"o" and
"p" were
located and
through
these,
vertical
lines
"s" and "t" were erected, and on these points were
taken
to mark the
height of
the
ridge "F," which
was
converged
towards
its
correct
vanishing point
at the
right.
Sketch "B"
is the same with the ex-
ception of the roof which
is here hipped instead of
gabled.
The
ends
of
the
ridge
were
located
by
erecting "A" and "B"
perpendicularly through the
points
of
intersection of the
diagonals
of
the tops
of the two cubes
forming
the
main
house.
And
Sketch "C" shows a different
roof of the gambrel
type,
the
gable having been drawn
first
just
as
at
"A"
as a guide.
The student may
feel that these are unusual con-
ditions
;
that few houses would be of
just the pro-
portion
of two
cubes,
and
this
is
of course
true.
It
is
not a
difficult
matter,
however, when
a cube
has been drawn as a unit, to add one or several more
in any direction,
or portions
of
one.
If the house
just considered was
to
be
thirty
feet
long,
for
in-
stance,
instead
of
forty,
the
second cube
could be
easily cut
in
half,
the correct
perspective
distance
being
judged
by
the
eye,
or
the
diagonals
of
its
nearest
face could be crossed which would give the
correct point of
intersection
for the
cut.
Once the main proportions have been established
the
doors and
windows,
roof
overhangs,
etc.,
can
be added and the whole completed.
Experience will
show many uses of diagonal lines in locating centers
and measuring distances, and other short cuts which
will prove a saving of time and an aid to accuracy.
Sometimes
it
is
desired
to
show
buildings
en-
tirely above the eye, as on a high
hill or mountain,
and again
it
is a part of the problem
to
represent
them
below
the
eye.
Sketch
"2"
illustrates
these
conditions
in a simple way.
Now whether buildings are above or below the eye
or
at
its
level and whether
simple or complex, the
same general
principles hold.
But when a building
is
complicated
in
its
masses,
or
irregular
in
plan,
it
is usually best to think of
it as inclosed within a
more simple mass, drawing this mass
first, and then
subdividing
it
into
the
smaller
parts.
Sketch
"3"
was designed to illustrate this thought, the dash lines
showing the simple mass which was drawn
first.
When
the
larger
proportions of a building
arc
established
there are many
details
to
lie added and
Sketch
"4"
pictures
a few
typical
ones
in
a very
meager way.
Many towers are based on pyramids
and cones such as those shown at "A" and "B." One
should practice these, then, and should try his hand
at
steps,
chimneys,
arches,
dormers,
etc.,
until
he
feels able to sketch any of the more commonly seen
details easily and well, either from the objects them-
selves (which is excellent practice) or from memory.
Sketch "S"
is
to show
that when
furniture
is to
he
represented
it
is
often
well
to
first block
it
in
very
simply
so
far
as mass
is
concerned,
just as
we did the building
in Sketch
3.
For the chair at
"A" two cubes were drawn as shown by the dotted
lines, and the
seat below
was
sketched
within
a
square
prism.
When
objects
are
thus
inclosed

SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
within simple forms or "frozen into a block of ice"
one
is
less
likely
to get them
incorrect
in perspec-
tive.
It
is suggested
that as a means of adding to
one's
ability
to do
this
well
lie
cut
out
prints
of
buildings and pieces of
furniture and sketch simple
shapes
around
them
with a few
lines,
preferably
straight,
for
this
will
help
one
to
realize
that
all
objects are comparatively simple in basic form.
Photographs or prints can help us in another way
in
the study of
perspective,
for we can
lay a ruler
on them or a T-square or triangle and produce with
a
pencil
the
various
series
of
parallel
lines
to
or
towards
their vanishing
points,
locating and draw-
ing the eye
level or horizon
line
first of
all.
This
will help one to understand the perspective phenom-
ena more quickly, perhaps, than any other one thing.
We
should
not
close
without some
reference
to
the
perspective
of
interiors,
though
a
brief
word
will
suffice,
for
it
is hardly necessary
to say more
than that interiors are done in just the same way as
are
exteriors, only we are
looking
at the
inside of
the cubes and prisms instead of at the outside, which
means that we simply remove those faces which are
the
nearest
to
us.
Rooms
themselves
are
usually
very simple as to form;
it
is in the furniture, turned
at
various
angles and
of
irregular
shape,
that one
encounters
the greatest
difficulty.
A
little
practice,
however,
will
give
one
considerable
proficiency
in
all of
this work.
One should
be cautioned,
nevertheless,
that
the
difficulties are not
few,
for whether one
is drawing
interiors
or
exteriors
or
small
objects
it must
be
borne in mind that
in theory he
is supposed to look
in the same fixed direction constantly until the draw-
ing
is
finished, and although
in
practice
this
is
not
especially hard to do when an object
is so small as
to come entirely within the range of vision without
the gaze being
shifted, when
it comes
to
large ob-
jects or entire rooms or buildings we are so accus-
tomed to glancing about from place to place that
it
is not easy to keep from making a sort of composite
sketch in which the various small parts may be cor-
rect
in
themselves,
but wrong when
considered
in
relation
to
one
another and
to
the
whole.
When
drawing a room, for instance,
it
is easy to go astray
by looking
first at a window and drawing that, and
next doing a door, and so on, one thing
at a time.
When
this method
is
followed the whole
is quite
sure to look distorted.
For
this reason one should
locate a horizon
line on the drawing whenever pos-
sible and
if vanishing points would
naturally come
within the paper area find them also, and in sketch-
ing the main
lines
try
to give them
the right pro-
portion and
perspective
convergence,
for
if
a
sort
of framework can be correctly built up for the whole
it will not be hard to add the detail
; therefore spend
plenty
of
time
on
this
first
work.
If
too much
trouble
is encountered
when
drawing
from
actual
buildings
sketch
from photographs
for
a
while
as
this will be much easier to do.
Then go on to por-
tions
of
interiors
and
exteriors
before
attempting
them
in an
entirety.
The excellent drawing by Mr. Watson on page 33
shows a type of subject which would prove extremely
difficult to block out because of the great number of
converging
lines,
unless one was
familiar with the
perspective principles involved
; and
if a subject of
this
nature
is
not
correctly
constructed
the
errors
will usually be glaringly apparent, regardless of the
quality of the technique.

Chapter VI.
CAST DRAWING
WE
NOW come to another important phase of
our work
cast drawing,
for as soon as the
student has gained
facility
in object draw-
ing, the next
logical step
is to turn to plaster casts
for
his
subjects
;
in
fact, many teachers make
cast
drawing a
starting point
for
the
beginner.
If one
is
to work
at home a
few
casts may
be
purchased, and the expense of obtaining the smaller
ones
is not great.
One
is more
fortunate, however,
if
he has
access
to
a museum
or
school
collection
which
will
give him
the opportunity
to make such
a choice for each drawing as will best meet his needs,
for there are casts of many kinds and sizes, ranging
all the way from tiny ones of coins and medals and
jewelry to huge plaster representations of sculptured
groups,
too enormous
to
be housed
in any but the
larger museums.
The
student
will be wise
in
selecting
first a cast
of medium
size, say a
foot or
so
in
its greatest di-
mension,
and
of
a
simple
subject.
The
architec-
tural student will find
it extremely beneficial to make
a
series of drawings of architectural ornament, and
there are
casts available of
all of
the better-known
forms.
A good
starting
point would
be
the
lotus
flower
or palmette
or
something of
the
sort which
has come down to us from the earliest times.
This
might be followed by others of
like nature, one
or
two
typical
forms
being
selected
from
each
well-
known
period.
There would
be the acanthus and
anthemion
of
the
classical work,
perhaps,
or some
of
the
incised
patterns
of
the
Byzantine,
or
the
roughly carved grotesques of the Romanesque, while
the
Gothic
is
particularly
rich
in
ornamentation,
showing
not only many geometric forms but natu-
ralistic and conventionalized carving of ivy, oak and
grape
leaves,
the
ball
flower,
etc.
Then compara-
tive sketches might be made of
capitals of different
styles
of
architecture and
of mouldings;
these
last
are especially important and every draftsman should
be
familiar
with such moulded members
as are
in
common use, enriched with the well-known egg and
dart, leaf and dart, guilloche, dolphins and acanthus,
bay leaf, etc., etc.
Let him study these and not only
his knowledge,
but
his appreciation
of architecture
will be strengthened.
For advanced studies the or-
ders of architecture might be drawn from the cast,
correctly represented
in perspective and with
all the
metopes,
triglyphs,
mutules,
modillions,
etc.,
care-
fully represented:
it
is doubtful
if there is a better
way to master the orders than to work in this man-
ner.
Nor is there a better way of learning to design
carved wood or stone or ornamental terra cotta than
by working from casts of antique examples, as one
not only
stores up knowledge of
the forms of the
past
but
unconsciously
assimilates
a
sense
of pro-
portion and
design
of
the
greatest value
in doing
original work.
If casts of ornament are chosen for the first prob-
lems
let them be simple, as we have indicated above,
and
comparatively
low
in
relief,
as
these
are
the
easiest to do.
Then the later problems should be so
arranged
that
high
relief
decoration
and
incised
ornament are also represented and that not only geo-
metric patterns are shown but conventionalized and
naturalistic representations of plant and animal
life
and the human form as well.
Some casts that are
delicate
in
detail
should
be done and some which
are bold and
vigorous
in
character
;
in
short, one
should
not
rest
content
until
he
feels
that
he has
quite successfully mastered every type of ornamental
subject.
The art student, however, may find a few of these
ornamental casts enough and then go on to the type
of subject which will prepare him more directly for
later work in drawing from the living model.
Here
as before
it
is best to select something which
is not
complex, a cast of a foot or hand or arm offering a
good
starting
point.
After
a
while
heads may
be
attempted and
the complete human
figure.
One
is hardly wise to attempt to draw from the
living
model
until
he
has
spent
considerable
time
in working from these inanimate objects, which will
hold the pose
until a drawing
is finished, something
which
the
living model
can
hardly
be expected
to
do.
And
neither do these casts have hues of color
to add
to the
difficulties of the
student.
Then
there are
anatomical
casts,
especially
de-
signed
to show the various bones and muscles, and
these should be studied at this time, for the art stu-
dent cannot
begin
too
early
to
learn anatomy and
its application
to problems in
art.
This practice from casts of the human form
is to
the
art student absolutely indispensable.
And
it
is
hardly
less
essential
for
those
of
the
architectural
profession,
for^ from
the
earliest times
the human
figure has been used in connection with architecture,
sometimes merely as applied ornament or decoration
and
sometimes
structurally,
as,
for
example,
the
caryatids
of
the
Erechtheion
at
Athens.
So no
architect can afford to neglect this part of his train-
ing.
He
should
study
especially
the
use
of
the
human
figure
as applied
to such
architectural
fea-
tures as
friezes, the tympana of the pediments, the
spandrels of arches, and the pendentives of
vaults;
also
the
free-standing
figure as used
in connection
with or as a part of architecture.
Now
regardless
of
the type of
cast
selected
for
the
first subject, the method of procedure
is exactly
the same as
for the drawing of objects, and as this
has been described fully elsewhere
it seems needless
to repeat
it here. We might mention, however, that
in order that the
lighting
shall be
satisfactory, the
cast should be
shifted,
if
possible, to various posi-
tions
until
one
is
found
which
brings
a
pleasing
relation of
light and shade.
Then the form should
be sketched and the shading
started.

CAST DRAWING

Figure
IT.
An Example of Cast Drawing in Light and Shade.

36
SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
It should be understood that the appearance of a
cast
will vary greatly under
different
lighting
con-
ditions, and
at various times
of the day,
for even
though north
light
is used
it
will
be more
or
less
changeable from time to time.
Therefore it is best to
work for only an hour or two daily until the drawing
is
finished,
these hours
being
in
the morning,
for
example,
or
in
the
afternoon.
For
the
light
is
usually about the same
for a few hours in
succes-
sion
at any given time of day, dark or rainy days
being,
of
course,
exceptions.
We have explained
before
that
the darkest tone
on
light
objects
is
usually
lighter than the darkest
tone on dark objects, though, strange to say,
it does
not often appear
so, therefore even though the cast
is
light,
its
deeper
tones
will
seem
quite dark
in
contrast with those areas receiving their illumination
more directly.
In the
first problems
it
is usually best to work in
full
values with a
fairly
sharp
pencil,
completing
each drawing with the greatest care, modelling until
the
nearer
parts
seem
to come
forward,
and
the
farther portions
retreat, subordinating the unimpor-
tant, but emphasizing the
essentials.
Caution must
lie used not to force those darks too strongly which
are
found
in
the
lighter areas
or
the
lights within
the shade tones; instead simplicity should be sought
just
as
in
object
drawing,
all
unimportant
tones
being suppressed.
Figure
1 1
is an example of cast
drawing in
full values of
light and shade.
In
later problems
separate
lines may be used
in
building up
the tones
;
in
fact there
is no harm
in
experimenting
in
various ways
of working,
trying
out any ideas which suggest themselves.
The archi-
tectural student can perhaps improve his draftsman-
ship if he does a few cast drawings on tracing paper,
mainly in accented outline or entirely so if he wishes,
using a
rather
clean-cut
line which
is
suitable
for
blue-printing;
in
fact,
prints may be made of each
drawing when completed.
Such work trains one to
make
better
scale
or
full-size
details
of
ornament
and
the
like.
It
is
helpful
also
for
one
to
occa-
sionally
select some cast of an architectural subject
and
instead
of drawing
it
in perspective
just as
it
appears,
to make
instead an
elevation
of
it
(using
instruments, perhaps, for some of the straight lines)
and
a
section
or
two
or
a
side
elevation,
all
so
drawn as
to correctly express the form and model-
ling of the object.
These drawings may be shaded
or
left
in
outline.
On page 20 is a drawing of ornament in accented
outline
only,
while
at
the
top
of
page 37
parallel
strokes of shading are combined with accented out-
line
effectively.
The drawing
at the bottom of the
same page has strokes of shading following the lines
of growth.
Casts based on the human
figure seem more dif-
ficult
to the average
beginner
than
do
those
of
ornament, and
like them
should
be most
carefully
drawn, painstaking effort being expended on every
part.
For the
first
portrait
drawings
such
casts
should be
selected
as show the
greatest amount of
individuality;
those
which
have
certain
marked
peculiarities which can be clearly grasped and repre-
sented.
Study the various planes of light and shade
and shadow as to form and value, giving particular
attention to the edges of the planes, sharpening them
or softening them
truthfully.
As
the
values
are
being built up
it
is often well to over-accent or force
such edges a
bit, as this will help one to retain the
virility
and
strength
expressed
in
the
cast.
The
reason
for
so
doing
is
to safeguard
the
student
against
having
everything
too
soft and
round, a
common
failing of the beginner.
In giving a draw-
ing
its
final
touches, edges which have
been made
too sharp must of course be lifted or softened until
they become
less
definite.
In portrait work we have a real test of
skill. One
may make errors when sketching an old hat or shoe
and they may not be conspicuous,
even in ornament
drawings mistakes are not always evident when the
work
is completed.
But when one does a portrait,
whether
from
photograph
or
cast
or
life,
unless
proportions and
modelling
are
true
there
will
not
be a perfect likeness and unless a student
is able to
get a likeness he knows that
his drawing
is
faulty.
If a good likeness
is lacking the drawing should be
compared frequently with the original and corrected
and changed
until
the
desired
effect
is gained and
the modelling
brought
to
as
near
perfection
as
is
possible.
This work from cast should never be hur-
ried over or neglected,
for one cannot hope to cope
with the difficulties of drawing from the living model
until
skill has been acquired in representing well that
which
has no
disturbing
hues
of
color and which
holds a steady position.
When one has acquired considerable skill in work-
ing on
white
surfaces,
tinted
paper may
be
tried,
the tone of the paper representing the middle values,
the lights being added with white pencil or chalk or
paint,
and
the
darks
built up
with
pencil.
Such
sketches are often very effective and results may be
obtained
quite quickly
in
this way,
but one should
not
neglect
the painstaking
studies on white paper
in order to make time for this sort of thing.
Aside
from
all
the
other advantages which careful work
has,
it prepares one
for work
in other mediums;
it
is an easy step from pencil to wash and from wash
to
color,
while pen drawing
is much
like
the
line
shading which
is often done with the
pencil.
The
architectural
student
is
called upon
to render much
ornament
in wash,
such as the
details used
in the
Class B
Analytique problems
in
the course
of the
Beaux-Arts
Institute
of
Design, and
in
renderings
of a competitive nature done
in the
offices, and the
making of carefully shaded drawings from the cast
will prepare one
directly
for
this
class of work.
Now by way of a
final
suggestion,
it
should be
made clear that unless a student
really has unusual
ability
he
should
not
attempt
this
advanced work
without a competent
instructor,
and
any
student,
regardless of
his
ability,
should get
criticism from
others from time to time,
for even though one may
develop by himself tricks of technique and a certain
cleverness
of
handling,
such
things
do
not
offset
faulty drawing, although they may hide
it from the
student himself.
Now we will pass on to a consid-
eration of life drawing, not without admonishing the
student, however, to attempt no work from life until
his
skill warrants
it
; remembering
that
unless one
can draw a good
likeness from the
cast he
surely
cannot do so from the living model.

Chapter
VII.
LIFE DRAWING
THERE
seems to be a general desire on the part
of
art
students
to hurry on through
all the
preliminary work of practice strokes and ton?
building, and
object drawing and
cast drawing
to
the subject which
is now before
us,
life drawing.
When
one
starts
to draw
from
real
living
people
he
feels that he
is about to get somewhere, that he
is
really on
the
road
to becoming an
artist.
And
the
importance
of drawing from
the
living model
cannot be denied.
So
large a percentage of
all
of
the drawings and
paintings which we
see about us
every day make some
use
of
the human
figure,
(many of then), and especially the work of an illus-
trative
nature
such
as we
find
in
our
books and
magazines,
giving
figures
the
position
of primary
importance),
it seems plainly evident that unless the
art
student
learns
to draw them
well
his
place
in
the art world
will be considerably
restricted.
So the students of sculpture, mural painting, por-
trait
painting,
illustration and commercial
art need
no urging to study life drawing, as they realize fully
to what extent
their success
will
depend
upon
it.
The
architect,
or
more
especially the beginner
in
architecture,
is
often
slow,
however,
in
perceiving
the advantages
to
be gained from pursuing such
a
course, especially those of that profession who lean
towards the practical rather than the aesthetic.
And
it
is not our contention that
life drawing
is the one
thing of primary importance to the architect.
What
we do wish to point out
is that
it offers enough of
advantage
to make
its
study
well worth the
while,
and we can give no stronger proof that this opinion
is quite general than by stating that in nearly
all of
our
larger
architectural
schools
the
students
are
given
life work as a regular part of their prescribed
courses of
study.
It
is not merely
that the archi-
tect
is sometimes called upon to draw a few figures
to add
interest or give
scale to a drawing of some
proposed building,
(for such work can be done well
enough to serve the purposes without particular skill
)
neither
is
it because he may
find
it necessary to
draw
sculptured
figures as
a part of
his design, as
in a pediment,
for instance,
or flanking a doorway,
for though
this
second
reason
is more
important
than the
first,
sculptors
or
trained
modellers
are
usually
called
in
to actually execute such work on
the building
itself, and they are capable of correct-
ing
errors and
going ahead
with
the whole
thing
sympathetically
once
the
architect has given them
his general
idea.
The study of
life drawing
is im-
portant more because
it gives such excellent tra'ning
in
light and shade and proportion, and an apprecia-
tion and
understanding
of
design
than
for
these
other reasons.
For
if one acquires the
fine percep-
tion which will enable him to note and analyze and
understand
the
subtle
variations between one
tone
and another which one
finds, especially when work-
ing from the nude, his architecture will be the better
for
it; and
if one assimilates, as he should, a
feel-
ing for rhythm and balance and symmetry and other
characteristics
of good composition,
it may be ap-
plied advantageously to his daily work
;
more than
this,
his
improved
skill
in
draftsmanship
will
be
always worth the
effort expended
to
obtain
it,
for
if one acquires
such
dexterity
as
enables him
to
flraw
figures
in
correct proportion he
will have no
great trouble
sketching the most complicated
archi-
tecture.
So the architect should be encouraged to take up
life work and
the
art
student's enthusiasm
should
not be curbed.
Both should be cautioned, neverthe-
less,
that
it
should
not
be attempted
until
proper
preparation has been made
for
it, and
it
is for this
reason that we have given so much space to urging
thoroughness
in
the
preliminary
work
in
object
drawing,
still
life,
perspective,
cast
drawing,
etc.
And both should be cautioned, too, against the
folly
of attempting to do
life drawing without proper in-
struction
and
criticism.
Fortunately,
there
are
evening courses
in most of
the
larger
cities which
give the students who lack the time or means of tak-
ing day courses the opportunity of learning at night.
To supplement such training there are many excel-
lent books on
all branches of the subject which can
be studied
as time permits.
Because
there
are
so many
books
available and
so many
classes open
to
students,
it seems
scarcely
necessary for us to go into the matter at any length
here,
in
fact, we could hardly do so without going
beyond
the
scope
of
our
subject,
for
whereas the
pencil
is used
frequently
for
figure work
it
is per-
haps more often employed
in preliminary
sketches
and studies than for the
final execution.
Then, too,
there
are
so many kinds
of
life drawings
that
to
describe them
all would require a good-size volume.
Whenever we
start to
erect any
sort of a build-
ing
it
is
essential
to have
a
firm
foundation
and
framework
on
which
to
build
the
superstructure.
In the same way
in
studying
the human
figure
it
is necessary to have our framework
; in this case the
human skeleton.
So the student should learn about
the skeleton
first
; he should study anatomy until he
becomes
familiar with
the
different bones,
individ-
ually and in their relation one to another.
He should
learn
the names by which
they
are
known.
He
should
know
the
different
positions
which
they
assume when one walks or runs or
sits or
reclines,
and
the
acquisition
of
such
familiarity
with them
will require conscientious study, and practice with the
pencil.
In
fact,
there
is no
part
of
life drawin?
which should be
carelessly done; too much empha-
sis cannot be given to this point.
Once
the
bones
are
well
understood,
attention
must be
directed
to the muscles
and
to
the
flesh
which
rounds
out
the
body.
One
should
learn
in
just what manner
the muscles
are
attached
to

bones
themselves,
just how they
appear when
at
rest and when in action.
And
it
is necessary to not
only study each important muscle by
itself,
but
to
also learn
its
relation
to every other muscle and to
the body as a whole.
When the larger groups
of
muscles
are mastered
attention
should
be given
to
some
of
the more
important
of
the
smaller
ones,
such as those of the
face.
The sculptor or portrait
painter
or
illustrator
will,
of
course,
give
special
thought to these, for unless they are well understood
it will be
difficult
for him to properly express such
emotions
as
sadness,
joy,
fear,
surprise.
For
al-
though the entire pose of the figure varies with these
emotions,
it
is not enough to have the proper action
in the body as a whole;
much
depends
on
these
smaller
parts.
To learn them well one must study
the
action
of
the muscles when
people
talk
or
eat
or
smile
or
whistle,
special
studies
being made
of
the eye, the ear, the nose and the mouth.
Then, too,
one must study the various characteristics of youth
and
of
old
age, and
of
the
different
races.
It
is
not only the
faces which
should
be carefully ana-
lyzed,
however.
Hands,
too,
are
very expressive;
the clenched
fist tells a far different story than does
the hand extended
for a clasp of
friendship.
Even
feet are very important
;
some
artists
who
seem
quite
familiar with the rest of the figure have much
difficulty with them or consider them too unimpor-
tant to be studied with
care.
Now
needless
to
say
it
is
best
before
studying
all of these smaller parts
in
detail to learn to draw
well
the
figure as a whole,
so
as soon
as one has
had some practice from the
skeleton placed
in
dif-
ferent
positions, he
should
start working from the
nude model.
In line with what we have said above,
the models should be varied not only as to sex but
as to age,
size and
race.
Then,
too,
the
lighting
should not always be
the
same.
As
to posing the
model
it seems
almost
needless to remark
that
the
student should work from a great variety of poses
;
the figure should be shown
at
rest,
sitting or stand-
ing
or
reclining, and
in
action.
Action
poses
are
often hard
for the model to take and
to hold, but
they
should
be
attempted,
especially
after
the
stu-
dent has gained enough practice from the figure in
repose to enable him
to work
swiftly and
directly,
so
that
the main
lines
of
action may be swept
in
while the model
is
still fresh.
In these let the model
be doing something
in a natural way; give a boy a
baseball
bat
for
instance and
let him put as much
action into the pose as though he intended to make
a home run; give an aged man a wheelbarrow
(or
as a substitute
for
it
two
sticks
will do)
and
let
him pretend
to trudge across the garden.
In these
poses
the model
will,
of
course,
remain
as
nearly
as possible in the one set position, resting and resum-
ing the pose as often as seems necessary.
There
is
another type of action pose, however,
in which the
model repeats some motion a great number of times,
rather
slowly,
so
the
student
is
able
to
study
the
muscles
as they assume different
positions.
Quick
sketches
can
be made showing
these changes
in a
comparative manner.
Boxing, fencing and the
like
offer
excellent movements
for
this
type
of
action
sketch, especially if one motion is repeated over and
over again.
Too
little of this w&rk is given in most
of our schools.
The architectural
student has
less need, perhaps,
for
these
action
sketches, than
the
artist,
for
the
nude or partly draped figure as used in architectural
sculpture and ornament is more often shown at rest
;
too much motion would be disturbing to the design
as
a
whole.
So
in
posing
the
model,
horizontals
and
verticals
should
be worked
for
to harmonize
with the structural lines of the architecture, many of
the
lines being straight or nearly
so, and the whole
arranged
to express
strength and
solidity.
In drawing from
the nude there
is no
principle
which is at all different from those already described
under object and cast drawing.
The placing on the
paper
is
arrived
at
in
just
the same
way,
points
being located to mark the extreme limits of the
fig-
ure.
The
student must
learn
to work quickly
for
even
the
easiest
poses
cannot
be
held
for
over
a
half hour and a new pose
is seldom quite the same,
even
if
intended
to
be.
The
student who has the
necessary
foundation
for
this work
will be able to
do away with many of the construction
lines which
are needed by the beginner
in
object drawing, but
he will, instead of making so many trial
lines, locate
only a few
salient
points, comparing these with the
model carefully and
correcting them
until they are
just right, for the model
is likely to sway and slightly
change the pose at any time. On the
first drawings
forget
all such small details as the features, fingers,
etc., but above
all be sure that the action of the fig-
ure and the general masses are correct. A half hour
or an hour
is
usually enough
for each subject
;
it
is better to do a number of them and get the essen-
tials of each pose than to spend too much time on
one.
The
shading
may
be
almost
neglected
or
merely
suggested on
the
early problems,
but
care-
fully
finished
studies
should
be made
later
with
special attention to the values.
The amount of time given to the study of the nude
figure
will, of course, depend largely on the aim of
the student, whether he
is to take up illustration or
portraiture or sculpture or some other form of
art
work.
Then when
one
has gained a
certain
facility
in
drawing
the nude
figure,
the draped
figure would
be a natural
subject, and
here,
too, the problem
is
difficult.
For
it
is very easy when representing the
folds of drapery to lose the proportions of the form
underneath
; hence,
it
is often desirable to sketch the
main
lines of
the
figure
first
exactly
as though
it
were undraped, adding the drapery
later.
In
fact,
in
all work where people are drawn
(or painted for
that
matter)
it
is necessary
to have
in mind con-
stantly the correct proportion of each complete
fig-
ure,
so
expressing
or
suggesting
it
that
the
effect
will be correct, for no amount of work on the cloth-
ing
itself
will make up
for
faulty construction.
When
it comes to the figure in
full costume new
difficulties
are
encountered,
for
the
expression
of
the
forms and
textures
of
the
various
fabrics
is
not
easy.
But work
from
the costumed
figure
is
very interesting, especially
if the model
is posed to
tell some
story.
Students of illustration should get
a great deal of work in which the problems are made

42
SKETCHING AND RENDERING
IN PENCIL
as
real
as
possible,
illustrating
incidents
in
actual
life or some character in literature, the model being
so dressed and posed as to express the idea to the
best advantage.
Backgrounds may be added from
the imagination.
And aside from this work from the posed model
there
is
no
better
practice
in
figure drawing than
to sketch members of one's family and his
friends,
or
people
passing
in
the
street.
Catch them
un-
awares
if you can and
the sketches
will be
all the
more lifelike for
it.
When you have no sketch book
at hand
or no opportunity to use one, study people
all
about
you,
and
imagine
that
you
are drawing
them, for this will help more than would be supposed.
Of
all
these
types
of
drawings which we
have
touched upon,
it
is hard
to say which
is the most
important,
for
everything depends on
the purpose
for which each study
is made.
The. architect needs
one
kind
of
work,
the
sculptor
another,
the com-
mercial
illustrator a
third, and
so
on.
Needless to
say the portrait painter or illustrator will follow the
work in pencil with more advanced study in pen or
wash
color, and
there
is no harm
if the others do
too
;
these
other mediums
can
usually
be
handled
quite
easily, however, once the pencil has been well
mastered.
And
it
is equally true that whether one
does object or cast drawing or outdoor sketching or
anything of this sort
in pencil,
lie
is doing far more
than mastering this medium
;
he is building a strong
foundation
for
all
other work
in
art.
The
illustrations
are shown
as
typical
examples
of
life work from the nude, done
in pencil.
Those
by
Jules Guerin on pages
38,
40,
51,
52
and
54
are
reproduced
from some
of
his
original
studies
for
the
symbolic
figures
in
his mural
dec-
orations
recently
put
in
place
in
the new
Lincoln
Memorial
at
Washington,
D. C,
of which Henry
Bacon was
the
architect.
These
drawings
are
ail
made from
life and are excellent examples to study,
being unusually interesting
in technique.
The
study on
page 43 by Eugene
F.
Savage
is
for one of the
figures
in
his
decorative
painting
"Idealism"
in
the
Polytechnic
Preparatory
School,
Brooklyn,
N.
Y.
This
drawing
is
the
one
from
which this figure was sketched into the picture
: pre-
viously a number of studies had been made from the
model.
A formal character was given to this figure
to
fit
it for incorporation in the picture, and though
the model was used this has not the naturalistic char-
acter of the customary life drawing.
The horse was
first sketched in from the
full-size cartoon, then the
figure was added.
The
drawings
by
Taber
Sears
reproduced
on
pages 44, 47 and 50 are also
studies from
life
for
mural paintings.
Mr.
Sears'
paintings of
religious
subjects are especially fine in conception and embody
much of the
spirit of Mediaeval times.
They have
a
character and
a manner
that
fit them
especially
well
for
their
places
in juxtaposition
to
the
archi-
tectural
detail
of
the churches
for which they are
made.
On pages 45 and 53 are excellent studies by Barry
Faulkner for figures in the mural decorations which
he has done
for
the
great Cunard
Building, New
York City, B. W. Morris, architect.
These are both
extremely
fine examples of
technique.
The
reproductions
on
pages
46 and
48
are
of
studies from
life by H.
I.
Stickroth
for
his mural
painting
"The
Valley
of
Contemplation"
drawn
while a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome.
The
originals
are
in
pencil
on
buff
paper.
This
technique,
too,
is
well worthy
of
the most
careful
study on the part of students of drawing.
On page 49
is a different type of subject, a study
by Frank Vincent DuMond
for
one
of
his mural
decorations
for
the
Panama-Pacific
Exposition.
These decorations represent the influx of the widely
different human
elements
that went
to make
Cali-
fornia:
the
Spanish
adventurers and
the mission-
aries,
the
scholars,
the
"forty-niners"
and
all
the
others.
In
this
spirited
sketch we
see a group
of
homeseekers pressing on across the plains to the new
land
of
promise.
The
study
is
in
pencil on gray
paper,
size about 30
in. by 40
in.
The
sketch of Vera Fokina by Troy Kinney on
page 55
is a figure study of unusual power.
It
is
one
of many
rapid
sketches Mr. Kinney makes
in
studying the movements of a dancer as a preliminary
to
the execution of one of
his
notable
etchings
of
the dance.
By means of these
studies Mr. Kinney
makes
definite many impressions
of movements
of
the
dance
preceding and
following
the movement
which he
chooses
to
represent
in
his
etching.
In
this way he
fixes
his
impressions of
the
character
of a momentary
action and
this undoubtedly
helps
him to embody in his etchings the sense of
life that
is one of their most admirable qualities.
The frontis-
piece to this volume
is another of Mr. Kinney's de-
iightful
sketches.

many
specialists
;
men who -give attention to the representation
of some one type of subject only.
We have
our
portrait
painters,
for
instance, and
our
land-
scape painters.
There are those who do nothing but
marine views or who
select
city
streets
or gardens
and
flowers
or
some
other
kind
of
thing
which
appeals
to them
individually.
Included
in these special groups of men are those
whose interest lies wholly or mainly in the picturing
of animals,
who devote years to the acquisition of
knowledge on
this
particular
class
of
subject
; who
go on expeditions far afield seeking
first hand infor-
mation; who travel the world over, perhaps, sketch-
ing and drawing and painting
all the time, wherever
animals are
found.
Hut we 'do
not purpose
to
consider
our
subject
here from the standpoint of these specialists; instead
we simply wish to point out to the reader some of
the
benefits which
the average
student
of
art may
gain from animal sketching in pencil, and to offer a
few suggestions regarding such work.
Animal sketching combines some of the advantages
of drawing from the human figure with those of out-
door sketching, for as the subjects to be pictured are
often
in
motion, one
gains an
ability
to grasp
the
most
significant
of
their
characteristics
instantly
and
a
facility
to
rapidly
represent them on
paper,
and
as animals
are
found
out
of doors,
as a
rule,
one must go
into
the
open
to draw
them,
which
should add to
his enjoyment and afford a
beneficial
change from the class room or
studio.
Aside from
these considerations, however, which do not always
exist, as the beginner frequently works indoors from
photographs
or
stuffed
specimens
which
can
be
drawn at
leisure, there
is another point worth men-
tioning, for
it should not be forgotten that the more
things one learns to draw and the greater his mental
collection
of
facts
of form and of
light and shade
and of
color becomes,
the easier
it
will be
for him

SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
to
advance,
especially
if
he
wishes
to
become an
illustrator or turns to the usual types of commercial
art for a livelihood.
And the more one knows about
animals,
the more he will wish to know, as a
rule,
for his
life will be the richer because of his knowl-
edge.
It
is seldom
that
living
animals can
be used
to
advantage for indoor classes, so the beginner in ani-
mal
sketching
is more
often provided
with
photo-
graphs or with
stuffed
specimens
from
which
to
draw.
Through these things he gains a fundamental
knowledge
of
his
subject
before
he
ventures
to
attempt the more
difficult task of working from
liv-
ing
things.
In many of our
cities
it
is
possible to
obtain
sketching permits which
allow
one
to work
in the museums, and the student who has this oppor-
tunity should
avail
himself
of
it.
not
only
because
it will
fit him
for his later work, but because he can
find in such collections mounted specimens of a rare
or unusual nature, such as animals from the tropics
or the polar regions.
It would hardly be wise
for the student who has
not
advanced
some
distance
in
his
art
studies
to
spend much time drawing
from
living animals,
yet
there will be no harm
if he occasionally does so, and
once he has gained a certain amount of
skill in work-
ing
from
still
life and
casts and
the
like,
he
can
profitably give considerable time to
it.
Then as soon
as he
is grounded
in
the
fundamentals
of
animal
sketching
through
the work
from
photographs
or
stuffed specimens as described above he should take
every
opportunity
for
such
practice
and make
the
most
of
it.
We
say
"take
every opportunity"
be-
cause one soon learns that he must get this practice
when he can
;
we do not always have animals about
us and even
if we do they sometimes
fail
to show
a willingness to pose.
In
fact,
it
is often necessary
to
follow animals
from
place
to
place
in
order
to
sketch them
at
all.
This
is
of
course
difficult,
so

the
beginner, drawing from
living animals
for
the
first
time, should
try
to catch them asleep or busy
eating or at rest
; even then they will offer difficulties
enough.
Domestic animals usually afford us the most satis-
factory subjects for our
first sketches, partly because
they
are more
often
available,
partly
because we
are
already more
or
less
familiar with
them, and
partly
for
the
reason
that they have
little
fear
of
man and so assume natural positions.
Cats and dogs
are good and they
offer a wide variety of
subjects,
and horses and cows and other quadrupeds common
to our farms are excellent,
too.
The beginner
will
also
find
that
as a
rule cows
or oxen or sheep or
other
slow
moving
creatures
are
easier to sketch
than such
restless or quick moving types as horses
or dogs or kittens, but this is not always so, for when
they are at rest one is about as easy to do as another.
When the student has
his paper
ready
and
the
subject
selected,
the method
of
working
will
be
about the same as for drawing from the human
fig-
ure.
Of course the different kinds of animals
dif-
fer more
in
appearance
than do
people, and
this
means
that even greater attention must be given to
the
interpretation
of
the
individual
characteristics
of each
subject, which
in turn
means
that
before
starting
to draw,
one
should
analyze
his
subject
thoroughly,
searching
especially
for
such
charac-
teristics as are not common to other animals.
Then
when the
first strokes are made on
the paper they
must be direct, for there
is
little time
for fumbling
or
erasing.
Of course
if the animal
is
at rest the
work may
be
carried
on more
leisurely,
but
it
is
well
to get the
habit of drawing
quickly and
posi-
tively.
Animals move
so constantly that the
artist
can seldom draw more than a few lines before some
change in posiEon
is noted.
In this case
it
is often
better
to begin anew, and
if another move
is soon

made
of
enough
importance
to
prove
disturbing
start
still another
sketch,
until
there are
possibly a
half dozen or more
small
ones begun on the same
sheet.
Then
these can be
carried along
simultane-
ously,
for the animal
will probably either resume a
previous
pose
sooner
or
later,
or
the
artist
can
change
his own position
until
his
subject
appears
relatively the same as before.
Usually the
first sketches are done in outline only,
though this outline should be made as expressive as
possible,
an entirely different line
is needed
for the
shaggy coat of a Saint Bernard dog than would be
used for some short haired type
like the hound.
If
the animal remains
fairly
still
it will not be
difficult
to add some shading to the outline, and
if time per-
mits,
it may be possible to put in enough surround-
ing detail so that the sketch tells some story, for the
animal can be shown as
if doing a special thing,
a kitten can be sketched,
for
,instance, as
if playing
with
a
spool
of
thread,
or a dog gnawing
a bone
may be shown, or a calf drinking from a
pail.
It
should
not be
supposed
that domestic animals
are the only ones
suitable
for
this free-hand work,
for
if one has the opportunity to sketch wild things
in
the woods- -though one
seldom
does
or
caged
animals as in a zoo, he should make the most of
it,
and
will sometimes find them even more interesting
than
the
domestic
species,
not
so much
that
they
are
different
in
themselves
but more because they
are
less
familiar
to
us.
Needless
to
say, such ani-
mals as these would be drawn by the same method
which we
have
already
described
for
those
of
a
domestic nature.
Now the student cannot make these sketches too
frequently for the practice will always be beneficial,
but if one wishes to become really proficient in ani-
mal sketching, he should not stop with work of this
kind.
He
should
learn something
of
the anatomy
of animals and this is by no means simple
; he should
learn
to
interpret and
express
their
emotions,
for
animals, especially the more
sensitive types such as
dogs, will show
fear or surprise or pleasure just as
plainly or even more plainly
than
a human
being.
He should study their habits.
He should learn whal
animals have ths most strength or alertness or agil-
ity and
in what manner they
display
these
charac-
teristics
; and he should bear
in mind, too, that
just
as animals have
individuality
considered
singly,
so
do groups
of animals
have
certain
characteristics
common to a given species.
If we study such groups
we
will
notice
these
differences
in many ways
;
let
a number of horses
and
cows
and
sheep
out
to
pasture and they
will
collect
in
formations
of
dif-
ferent sorts and these formations will change under
varying
conditions.
Some
groups
of
animals
if-
driven
to
fight
will make a
circle with
their
heads
towards the
outside
;
others
will
separate and
each
go his own way.
It seems hardly necessary to more
than
touch
on
such
differences
here and
it would
take much
space
to do
so, but
let the student make
observations
for
himself.
Now when
it comes to sketching groups of animals
it will be found that one can
scarcely work without
some recourse
to
his memory and
imagination,
for
even though a few in a group may retain their posi-
tion for some time
it
is more than
likely that others
will
be moving.
This means
that
it
often
proves
necessary
to sketch them one or two at a time, put-
ting them into natural
arrangements
on
the
paper
later.
The most difficult thing of
all, perhaps,
is to suc-
cessfully picture animals in rapid motion.
One must
learn by observation and study the impression given
by such movements and then attempt to put this im-
pression on paper.
The excellent sketches of animals by Mr. Charles
Livingston
Bull, accompanying
this
text,
are taken
directly from
his own
sketch books and are worthy
of the most careful studv.

PART
II.
Chapter
I.
ARCHITECTURAL CONSIDERATIONS
WHEN
the student has obtained a sound fun-
damental knowledge of the subjects treated
in Part
I, namely
Object Drawing in Out-
line, Object Drawing in Light and Shade, Free-hand
Perspective,
Cast
Drawing,
Life
Drawing
and
Sketching Animals,
it would seem that he might find
little
difficulty
in
sketching
buildings,
street
scenes
and the like.
Yet every new subject presents
its peculiar prob-
lems
;
there are many things that the beginner will
hardly know how
to approach.
A street scene or a
landscape
or
a
building,
for
instance,
needs a
far
different treatment than
a
posed model
in
the
life
class,
but
the
artist
should
be
trained
to do
all
of
these well, especially
if he hopes to become an illus-
tator or commercial
artist.
If typical book or mag-
azine
illustrations, or
free-hand drawings of almost
any sort in which figures appear, are studied,
it will
be
seen
that
buildings
or
portions
of
buildings
or
bits of landscape are given almost as much attention
as
the
figures
themselves,
one
could
hardly hope
to become
successful
in
such a
line of work
if he
lacked
skill
in
the
representation of any of these
things.
Among the following chapters the art student will
find many valuable hints to help him draw these sub-
jects
for
some
have
been
especially
prepared
to
offer suggestions on the drawing of
buildings, both
in whole and
in
part, as well
as
all
sorts of acces-
sories such as water and clouds
; then there are other
chapters presenting many
facts regarding technique,
composition,
decorative drawing, the uses of
tinted
paper, etc., for one should master these, too, in order
to
gain
versatility.
If
skill
in the
representation of
buildings
is im-
portant
to the
artist or
the
art student
it
is
indis-
pensable
to
the
architect and
his
assistants, and
it
is mainly
to meet
their
requirements
that
the
fol-
lowing
chapters have
been
prepared.
If
the
time
for
drawing
practice
is
limited,
the
work
in
ob-
ject
drawing
and
cast
drawing
and
life
drawing
described
in
Part
I may be omitted by the
reader
of architectural inclination and he may turn directly
to
the problems
discussed
in
these
coming
pages,
where
the
subject
of
Sketching and Rendering
in
Pencil
is considered mainly from the standpoint of
the architect.
Rut unless the reader is well grounded
in drawing
it
is desirable that he study Part
I and
before going further
it
is advisable to study at least
the
first two
chapters
of
Part
I, and
Chapter V
on
free-hand
perspective.
A
knowledge
of
per-
spective
is essential
to anyone who paints or draws,
and especially to those who
find the representation
of
buildings or
street
scenes
a part
of
their work.
Selecting
the
Subject
In
Part
I
emphasis was
placed on the importance of selecting a suitable sub-
ject for each drawing, and
it
is equally essential
for
the work to be done at present that the choice be as
carefully made
;
it is as much of a problem to learn
to
select as
it
is to learn to draw.
Now the archi-
tectural draftsman or student wishes
to learn archi-
tecture as well as how to draw, so
it
is usually best
for him to choose some architectural object of merit.
The drawing may be made
directly from some
in-
teresting portion
of a building,
if
the
student
feels
capable
of
attempting
this,
or from
a photograph.
In
either case
it
is well not to attempt too much at
one
time.
When
the
subject
has
been
chosen
it
is
neces-
sary next
to
decide
exactly how much
of
the
ob-
ject
is to be drawn.
If one works from the photo-
graph
this
is
comparatively
easy,
for
by
using
strips
of
paper
or
cardboard
as
a
frame,
suitable
compositions
can
be
found.
One
has more
diffi-
culty, however, when drawing directly from a build-
ing
for
it
is then necessary
to determine the point
from which the best view can be obtained.
If you
were to photograph
such
an
object
as
you
have
selected
to draw,
the
view-finder
of
the
camera
would help you to determine the best point at which
to stand and would frame
for you any number of
interesting views from which you might
select
the
best.
The same
idea may
be
carried
out by
the
student of sketching, either by using a camera view-
finder or, what
is more commonly done, by making
a
view-finder
by
cutting
a
rectangular
opening
about
\ l/2
in. x 2
in. through a sheet of
stiff paper
or cardboard, which, when held near the
eye,
will
help you to decide the point from which the draw-
ing can
best be made.
Once the subject has been
chosen and the point from which
it
is to be drawn
decided upon, we are ready to block in the propor-
tions of the sketch.
At
this point
it
is as
well
to remind the student
that
it
is more difficult to learn what to leave out of
a drawing than what
to put
in.
As we minutely
examine any object in nature we see an overwhelm-
ing mass
of
small
detail.
Even
as we
sit
in our
rooms and
glance
around we
find,
if we
search,
thousands of spots of light or shade or color.
These
tiny spots are the many lines of
the
delicate grain-
ing
of
the
wood,
the
hundreds
of
partly-visible
threads
from
which
the
hangings
and
upholstery
materials
are woven,
the myriad
indentations and
projections
of
the masonry and
plaster.
It is hardly necessary to point out that
it would be
impossible
to correctly
indicate each of these spots
on a small sheet of paper, even
if
it were desirable
to
do
so.
Instead we must
try
to
represent
the

63
effect of the mass as a whole, the effect that we get
not when we hunt
for such
details,
but when we
enter a room and
look around
in
the
usual
way.
If we do
look
directly
at
some
object
such
as
a
chair
in
a
room
corner we
see
little
detail
with
the
exception
of
that
in
the
chair
itself
and
in
those
objects
adjacent
to
it.
Even
in
these
ob-
jects we are not conscious of each tiny spot, but in-
stead notice only the broad general tone and
effect.
The chair, being directly in the range of
vision,
is
the center of
interest and the other objects become
more and more
indistinct and
blurred
the
farther
they are from this center.
It
really
is a surprising
thing what a small area we are able to
see plainly
when
looking
in
one
direction
only.
We
are
so
accustomed
to
shifting
our
eyes
constantly
from
one
object
to
another
that we
fail
to
notice
this
limitation.
Stand
within
ten
feet
of
a
door and
gaze
intently
at
the knob.
Without
shifting
the
eyes,
are you able
to
see the top of the door
dis-
tinctly?
If you
raise the eyes and look
at the top
of the door, do you see the bottom plainly?
Go to
the window and look
at some
building across
the
street.
Fix your attention on an upper window or
chimney
or some
part
of
the
roof.
Are
not
the
lower portions of the building blurred and indistinct
unless you
shift your gaze
to them?
When you
look
at
the
foundation
you
do
not
see
the
roof
distinctly.
Now in making a drawing
it
is assumed that the
artist
is
looking
in some one
fixed
direction.
He
gazes
at some
interesting
object
or,
if
the
entire
object
is
too
large
to
come
within
his
range
of
vision,
he
selects
some
prominent
feature
which
then becomes the center of
interest or
focal
point.
In making the drawing more
detail
is shown near
this center of interest than
in the other parts, which
are
allowed
to become
more
and
more
indistinct
towards
the edges of
the picture,
just as they ap-
pear
in
nature.
Every
drawing
should
have
this
center of interest or
focal point and
all
else should
be
subordinated
to
it.
Now turn
to the
illustration,
Figure
12.
Cover
the lower two drawings and study the upper draw-
ing "A."
In
this sketch the spectator was looking
towards
that part of the
old farm buildings
near-
est
to him,
so
this becomes
the
center
of
interest
or focal point
;
all else
is subordinated.
Look
at
sketch "B,"
first
covering up
sketches
"A" and "C."
Here the spectator's eye has turned
towards
the
center
of
the
building
and
interest
centers
in the large doorway and adjacent
walls
here
the
details
show most
plainly
and
here
are
the
strongest accents of
light and shade.
The two
ends of the building become rather blurred and
in-
distinct
; they are subordinated.
Now uncover "C" and cover "B."
In "C"
the
spectator
is
looking
still
farther
to
the
left
and
even though
that portion
of
the building
is some
distance from
the
eye,
it
is .the portion on which
the
eye
is
focused,
hence
the
strongest
contrasts
and accents
are there and the
rest of
the building
is subordinate.
Turn to Figure
13, the street scene.
In the draw-
ing at the left the spectator
is looking at the upper
part of the tower; that becomes the subject of
the
sketch,
the
foc#l
point or
center
of
interest.
The
street is blurred, the detail is softened.
In the second
drawing the
spectator
is
looking down
the
street
;
the archw'ay becomes the center of
interest and the
tower is almost lost against the sky.
Now in draw-
ing such a subject as
this street scene from nature
the student
is likely to get into difficulty.
He looks
first, perhaps,
at the tower and draws
that.
If he
stops
there
all
well and good
;
the tower becomes
the
subject
of
the
sketch.
But
if
he
lowers
his
gaze to the street and adds the archway to his draw-
ing
it
is quite possible that this
will form a second
focal
point
which
will
compete
with
the
tower.
Then the drawing will be a
failure for the eye
will
jump back and
forth
between
the tower and
the
archway and the balance will be destroyed.
In such
a composition as
this, where there are two possible
centers of
interest, be sure that one
is subordinated
to the other.
Now turn to Figure
14, the
little interior-
Where
is the center of
interest represented
in the drawing
at
the
top
of
the sheet?
Where does
the eye
see
the most
detail and the strongest contrasts of light
and dark ? The window with
its seat
is outside the
focus and
it
is only when the eye turns towards
it
as
it does
in
the lower picture
that
it becomes the
center of
vision or
focal
point.
In
this
latter case
the mantel
is
out
of
focus
and might be
omitted
from the drawing; in
fact, this room could be made
the subject of two
interesting sketches, one of
the
fireplace and one of the window and
seat.
In such
a room
as
this we
can
well
imagine
that
in
the
evening the fireplace with the family drawn up en-
joying
a
cheerful
blaze would
be
in
all ways
the
center of interest in the room, while in the daytime
the window
with
its
seat
would
doubtless
gain
greater attention.
Now turn to the delightful sketch by Mr. Watson
on page 66;
notice that he has
built up
his center
of
interest
very
effectively
yet
without
forcing
it
upon
the
attention
unpleasantly, and
observe,
too,
that the drawing
is allowed
to soften or
fade away
gradually from those parts which come most directly
within the range
of
vision.
Let
it be
plain,
then,
that
in
starting a drawing
it
is
important
to
first
of
all
select
something
of
interest
to draw
;
next,
it
is necessary
to
find
the
best
point from which
the drawing can be made
;
then we must analyze our subject to determine the
center
of
interest or
focal
point, and having done
this we must use every care to subordinate
all those
parts which have
little or nothing
to do with
our
subject, and which
might
detract from
the
center
of interest.

THE
student should determine before sharpen-
ing
his
pencils
just what they are
to be
re-
quired
to do, and should point them accord-
ingly.
Sharply-pointed pencils will answer very well
if a drawing
is to be small or
if much
fine detail
is
to be shown, but
if
it
is to be
large, broad pointed
pencils
will
usually produce an
effect equally
satis-
factory
in
a much
shorter
space
of
time.
Many
drawings combine both fine lines and wide lines with
excellent
results.
No
special
directions
for
forming a sharp point
seem
necessary,
but
a broad
point
is
not
so com-
monly
used,
so
the
following
suggestions
are
of-
fered.
First of
all, cut away the wood in the usual
manner
just
as
for a
sharp
point,
but
leave
one-
quarter or three-eighths of an inch of the
full-sized
lead exposed.
(If
this
lead
is
left too
long, how-
ever, especially
in the softer
pencils,
it
will quickly
break
under
pressure.)
Next,
wear
the
point
down
on
fine
sandpaper
holding
the
pencil
at an
angle of about 45 degrees with the paper, until the
lead has the appearance shown
at "A,"
Figure
15.
The end
of
the
lead
should
next
be smoothed
by
rubbing
it on rough
paper
until
each
stroke gives
a firm, even tone when the pencil
is held as at "B."
Occasional
fine
lines
or
accents
in
a drawing
can
be made with
this broad
point
if
it
is
held on
its
sharp edge
as
at
"C,"
but
if many
fine
lines
are
needed a sharply-pointed pencil will prove more sat-
isfactory.
The type of broad point just mentioned
is used by many
artists but others go
still
further,
and by
slightly
squaring
the whole of the exposed
lead, after
it has been sharpened as described above,
obtain a very crisp, clean-cut
line.
The
illustrations
made by the author
for this text were
for the most
part drawn with
this
latter type of
point.
Regardless
of how
the
pencil
is
sharpened
care
should be taken that the point
is wiped with a cloth
in
order
to
remove
all
dust,
for
otherwise
it
is
difficult to get a clean, firm
line and next to impos-
sible
to
keep
the
paper
from
becoming
soiled
by
the
loose
grit from the
pencil.
Another
point
for
the beginner to remember
is that
in sharpening the
pencil the
letters or numbers
indicating the degree
of hardness or softness of the lead should never be
removed.
Having pointed and
dusted
the
pencils, they are
ready
for
use,
though
it
will
be
convenient
to
so mark each one
that
its
grade can
be
told
at a
glance.
There
are
several
ways
of
doing
this.
One
is by cutting or painting the
letters indicating
the grade of the lead on several
sides of the pencil
where
they can
be
seen
easily, and another
is by
notching
the
pencils,
increasing
the
number
of
notches
as
the
pencils
become
harder
in
grade.
Such letters or notches are perhaps most convenient
if
placed
about one and
one-half
inches from
the
unsharpened end
of the pencil where they
will
re-
main
in view.
If near the point they
will soon be
cut away and
if
at
the
other
extremity they
will
be hidden
if
a
pencil holder or lengthener
is used.
Some artists, instead of marking their pencils, always
lay them on
the drawing board according to grade.
By
this
arrangement
they
can
tell
the
degree
of
hardness of a pencil
at a glance by
its
position on
the board and when
it has been used
it can be
re-
turned to
its proper place and another taken up. A
still
different way
of marking
pencils
for
identifi-
cation
is by dipping them
into various
colors, each
color
representing a
definite grade
of
lead.
The question may arise as to the number of pen-
cils
necessary
for
one
sketch.
This number
will
vary
all
the way from
one,
for a quick sketch,
to
seven or eight as used by some draftsmen for care-
fully
finished
work.
Some
very
well-known men
never
use more
than
one
grade
of
pencil
for
an
entire
drawing
but
the
student
can as a
rule get
better results by the use of three or
four.
The two
little
sketches on Figure 20 were made with a 2B,
HB, F, H and 3H.
Practice
Strokes
When
the
pencils
have
been
properly
sharpened
the
student
can do nothing
of
greater
benefit than
to draw many
individual
lines
with
each
point
before
attempting
complete draw-
ings.
Try to make every stroke a thing of beauty,
for
it
is only by combining many beautiful
strokes
that a pleasing
final
result can be obtained.
Draw
lines of
all kinds and in
all directions
; some straight
and others curved; some uniform
in tone from end
to
end and
others
grading
from
light
to
dark
or
from dark to light.
Allow some to fade out so grad-
ually that the ends are lost in the tones of the paper
and accent others
at the ends by using extra pres-
sure
as
the
pencil
touches
or
leaves
the
drawing
surface.
Keep some
straight and
sharp, drawing
them
very
quickly
with much
freedom, and
form
others
rather
slowly,
allowing them
to
quaver
or
tremble.
Use
considerable pressure on
some,
thus
smoothing or "ironing out" the paper, and in others
barely touch the
pencil to the surface.
Make
lines
with both broad and fine points, with various grades
of
pencils, and on
all
sorts of paper
until you
feel
a
certain
confidence
in
your
knowledge
of
your
mediums.
Tone
Building
When
this
feeling
of assurance
is acquired, attempt building up even tones by mass-
ing
the
strokes
together,
either
touching
or
with
slight spaces between.
Think clearly what you wish
to do before you begin and then draw with direct-
ness
and
vigor,
remembering that sharp "snappy"
work
is
the
kind
most
popular
for
architectural
purposes.
There are no definite
rules regarding tone build-
ing
but
perhaps
the
simplest
method
is to draw
parallel
straight or
slightly curved
lines just touch-
ing
one
another
or
with
slight
spaces
between.

STARTING THE WORK
71
Sometimes these lines are horizontal but more often
vertical.
Occasionally entire drawings are made by
using tones composed of
vertical strokes only.
The
drawing of the doorway "A" at the bottom of Fig-
ure
16
is done by
this method.
There
is
danger,
however,
of
such
lines becoming too
rigid
or me-
chanical,
or
in some
cases
too conspicuous,
so the
method shown at "B," in which the lines are allowed
to go
in any and
all
directions,
is
a much more
popular one, and one adaptable to
all types of sub-
jects.
This method
is sometimes referred to as the
"Free Line Method."
In
building
tones
there
are
several
points
con-
cerning
which
the
beginner
should
be
cautioned.
First, beware the use of too many small
lines.
If
twenty
lines
will
do,
it
is
ordinarily
folly
to
use
forty.
There
is
danger
especially
in
the
use
of
many
short, broken
lines,
as they often produce a
spotty
effect,
the more
so
if the white spaces be-
tween
the
ends
of
the
lines
are
too
conspicuous.
Long, unbroken lines, on the other hand, sometimes
appear too mechanical.
It
is
best
as
a
rule
to
so
vary the length of
lines as
to produce an
interest-
ing variety, avoiding too many lines of equal length
and
similar
direction.
Tones are occasionally built
up by "cross hatching" but
it
is usually best to avoid
this
expedient.
Figure
16 shows, however,
several
examples
of
cross
hatching,
and
sometimes
such
tones
are
highly
desirable,
especially
for
shadows
and background purposes.
Frequently
in drawing
shadows,
especially under cornices, the
lines form-
ing the shadow tones are
so
slanted
as
to suggest
the direction of the light.
A sparkling, sunny effect
is obtained, too,
if the shadow tone
is sharpened or
darkened
along
the
lower
edge,
thus
forming
a
strong contrast against the
light
surfaces below.
Needless
to
say,
it
is most important to
so vary
the lines and tones as to express the textures of the
materials
represented by
the
sketch.
Observation
and practice
will teach the student the best way to
indicate wood, masonry,
glass,
metal,
cloth,
water,
and the
like.
Do not erase unless absolutely necessary, as results
are never
entirely
satisfactory over an erased
sur-
face.
If mistakes are made, use a soft eraser with
extreme
care and
be
sure
to
dust
the
paper
thor-
oughly afterwards with a soft brush or
cloth.
Al-
ways keep an extra piece of paper under the hand
as you work
to
protect
the
surface
of
the
sheet.
Figure 15 and Figure 16 show a number of practice
strokes
and
tones
done
partly
with
a
broad
and
partly with a fine point.
Small Drawings and Quick Sketches.
When the
student has practiced tone building
for some time
he
is ready
to
try simple drawings.
Often
more
benefit
can
be gained
from making
a number
of
small sketches than from attempting one large ren-
dering.
As has been before
suggested,
the
archi-
tectural
student
will
be
wise
if, when
selecting
subjects
for
his
sketches,
he
chooses
objects
of
architectural
value
and
interest.
The
sheet
of
sketches, Figure 17, is shown for two reasons.
First,
it
illustrates
a
quick
method
of
sketching,
the
drawings being very
freely and rapidly made
; and
second,
it suggests to the student a means by which
much
knowledge
of
architecture
can
be
obtained.
One cannot
fail, when
making
such
sketches,
to
learn
a great deal
of value concerning the
objects
which
he
represents.
Figure
18
is
also published
here
for two
reasons.
First,
it shows
in
a com-
parative manner two types of
line,
the broad and
the fine, used side by side for representing the same
building;
and
second,
it
is
a
typical
presentation
drawing such as
is submitted to a client as a means
of
securing
a
commission.
This
sort
of drawing
often brings new work
into the
office, and
is,
for
that
reason,
of
the
greatest
value
to
the
architect.
This particular drawing was laid out instrumentally.
The original
sheet measures about 10^"xl4^" to
the margin lines.
Figures 15 and 17 were originally
drawn about 9"xl2j4", so the student should allow
for
this
reduction when
studying
these
sheets.
It may be of service to mention that, once a sub-
ject
is
selected
for
a
sketch
or
rendering, whether
large or small,
it may be drawn in outline in either of
two ways
; the outline may be roughly blocked in with
sketchy lines, which are to be erased when the final
rendering
is
started,
or
it may be more
carefully
drawn
directly with
final
lines,
keeping them
as
a
rule very
light by using a hard
pencil, and leaving
them to become a part of the finished work.
When
the
outline
has
been
completed
there
are
several
methods
of procedure before
the
student
;
he can
put in the darkest tones of the whole drawing, later
adding enough gray
tones
to complete
the
picture,
or he can put in the gray tones first, as has been done
in making the
little sketch
at the bottom of Figure
15, later adding the dark tones and sharp accents to
finish the drawing.
Many artists complete their work as they proceed,
beginning at the center of interest and working out,
or beginning at the top and working gradually down
towards
the bottom.
This
latter method
has
one
great
advantage
in
that
the
drawing can
be
kept
clean more
easily than by
the
other methods,
but
unless the student
is able
to think very
clearly be-
fore drawing or unless he makes
first a preliminary
sketch
for
the purpose
of
studying
the
values
of
light and
dark,
it
is
a
difficult
one.
As
a
rule
it
is far safer to start at the center of interest, making
sure that the strongest contrasts of light and shade
and the sharpest
details are
there, keeping the
rest
of the drawing properly subordinated.
Contrasts.
There are various ways of obtaining
contrasts and two
of
the most common
are
illus-
trated by Figure
19.
A white
spot against a black
background always shows
so
plainly
that
the
eye
goes to
it very quickly. Likewise a black spot against
white attracts immediate attention.
Now, many ob-
jects
in
nature
are
similar
to
these
spots.
For
instance, a white house in strong sunlight against a
background
of
dark
trees
is
similar
to
the
white
spot mentioned above and the eye sees
it quickly be-
cause of the contrast.
A dark building silhouetted
ngainst the sky illustrates the idea of the dark spot
against
the
light background.
Now,
a white
spot
against a dark tone appears even whiter if the dark
tone grades
gradually
to
white
so
as
to have no
sharp
edges
to
lead
the
eye from
the
spot
itself,
and
in
the
same
way
a
dark
spot
against

white background
will appear even blacker
if
the
white background grades
out gradually
to gray or
black,
for this
will cause the white background
to
appear
even
whiter by
contrast.
The
spots "A"
and "B" at the top of Figure 19 illustrate this point
.as do also the small sketches of houses "C" and "D."
It must be remembered,
too,
that the
light con-
ditions in nature Vary constantly, so
it
is possible for
an object to appear light against dark during certain
times
of
the day and dark
against
light
at
others.
For example
an
office
building
in
bright
sunlight
might appear light against a deep blue sky until eve-
ning when
it
might
change
to
a
dark
silhouette
against
a
brilliant
sunset
sky.
The
drawings
of
the lighthouse, "E" and "F" at the bottom of Figure
19
still
further
illustrate
this
point.
This example
is rather extreme but serves to make clear that two
sketches
of
a
building
made
at
different
hours
might
vary
greatly
from
each
other.
Therefore,
when working from nature
it
is necessary to draw
very quickly as
the
light
is
constantly changing.
In
order
to
prevent
a
sketch
being
broken
up
into too many equal areas of
light and shade, thus
causing
confusion,
it
is
often
well
to
look
for
some one leading
light area and some one leading
dark area in the objects
to be drawn.
If a sketch
is to be made of a dark stone building, that perhaps
becomes
the
leading dark
area and
the
light
area
may be
found
in
the
foreground
or
sky
or
both.
On the other hand,
if a building
is
light
in tone
it
becomes in itself the leading light area and the back-
ground
of
trees
or sky
or the
foreground masses
become
the
dark
area.
Having
decided
on
these
leading
light and dark
areas,
look
for subordinate
areas,
such
as
doors,
roofs
or
similar
details and
give each just
its proper amount of accent to make
a
satisfactory
composition
of
the
whole.
It
is
usually true that we
find
in the same subject many
contrasts
of
light
against
dark
and
dark
against
light, but in making a sketch remember that the eye
would
see
the
strongest
contrasts
near the
frcal
point, or center of
interest.
Look
for the sharpest
accents
here
and
in
the
drawing
subordinate
all
others,
for
unless
this
is done
the
eye
will jump
from
one
point
to
another,
which
will
cause
the
picture to lack unity and repose.
It
is easy to hoH
the eye at the center of
interest as has been shown
above
if
strong contrasts
of
light
against dark
or
dark
against
light
are
shown
there.
The
two
sketches
on
Figure
20
still
further
illustrate
this
principle of contrast.
The center of interest in the
first
is
around
the
arched
entrance and
here
the
contrasts have been kept sharp and
strong.
First
there
is the light spot of the opening to the
street.
Then
in sharp contrast to
this
is the dark tone of
the archway
itself.
This
in
turn
is
strong
in
its
contrast
with
the
lighter
tones
of
adjacent
walls,
and these light tones on walls and street are empha-
sized
further by
the
fact
that
they
are graded
to
dark at
the
edges
of
the
sketch.
In the second
sketch, showing one
of
the
earliest
forms
of
tim-
ber construction, there are similar contrasts to hold
the eye to
the center
of
interest.
First
the
dark
doorway becomes
the
focal
point.
This
is
strong
in
its contrast with the surrounding
light walls of
the building and with the
street,
while
these
light
tones are in turn surrounded by the large dark area
of
roof
tones,
verge board shadows and
the
like,
which are graded outward to the edges of the sketch.
In starting a pencil drawing the student
is urged
to make a preliminary study of the values of light
and dark as soon as the outline has been completed.
This study can be made to good advantage on trac-
ing paper
directly
over
the
outline
drawing,
and
when completed will serve as a guide for the actual
rendering.
Once the values have been determined
in
this way,
the
student
is
free
to give
his
atten-
tion
to
the
technique.
At
this
point
it might
be
well
to
offer
a
few
suggestions.
First
of
all we
must work
for variety of
line,
for
it
is impossible
to express
all materials, and surfaces with one type
of
line.
Smooth,
straight
strokes
suggest smooth
surfaces, while irregular strokes are best for repre-
senting rough, uneven surfaces.
As a rule
it
is well
for the strokes
to follow the structural lines of the
objects
to
be
represented.
This
means
that
the
strokes used on vertical w; 11s will usually be vertical
or
perspectively
horizontal.
The
roof
lines
will
follow
the
slope
of
the
roof
or
vanish towards a
point with the other parallel lines.
Curved surfaces
can
as
a
rule
be
best
represented
by
the
use
of
curved
lines.
It
is
suggested
that
the student
try
a few prac-
tice sketches to further fix in his mind some of the
ideas suggested
in this text.
Do not be discouraged
if
the
first
results
are not
entirely
satisfactory;
it
is only by making mistakes and
profiting by them
that one can learn to draw.

Chapter
III.
INDIVIDUAL STYLE
STUDENTS
of drawing
often
foolishly handi-
cap themselves right at the start by attempting
to produce sketches that show marked original-
ity or individuality.
Such students seem to be of the
erroneous
opinion
that
unless
their
work-
is
so
unusual
in presentation
as
to appear almost
freak-
ish,
it
is not good.
They therefore
sacrifice
tru'.h
in
order
to
create
drawings
with
a
technique
so
peculiar and
predominant
as
to
detract
from
the
subject of the sketch
itself.
In some types of deco-
rative drawing a conspicuous method of
technique
is
not
wholly
bad,
but
for
architectural
purposes
anything that lessens the interest
in the architecture
itself
is unsatisfactory.
It
is
not
to be
understood
by
this
that
work
should
not show
a
certain
individuality
;
it
should
and
will,
for
it
is
impossible
for
one
to
practice
drawing
for any length of time without developing
certain
original
mannerisms.
This
is
most
desir-
able, for
it would be unfortunate indeed
if
all pencil
artists were to draw
in exactly the same way, pro-
ducing work of monotonous
similarity.
But there
is no danger
of
this.
Just
as most
of
us acquire
a
certain
characteristic
style
of penmanship which
our
friends
are
able
to
distinguish
as
ours
at
a
glance, we are also
sure
to
attain a
style of draw-
ing having a character exclusively
its own.
To be
sure many draftsmen
do
draw
in
very
much
the same way and
this
is
perfectly
natural
and proper,
for we are
all
influenced by the work
which we see others do, and we
all share,
also, the
definite limitations which our medium imposes upon
us.
It will be found, however, that drawings which
seem very similar in technique at first glance, reveal
individual
differences
on
closer
inspection,
even
though done by men with
similar training and ex-
perience.
Have no
fear then
of
losing your own
individuality, even though you
frequently
study
or
copy
the work
of master
draftsmen.
In
order
to
profit
to
the
greatest
extent by
the
experience of others,
collect as many reproductions
of
excellent
pencil drawings as
possible.
By care-
fully analyzing and comparing
these,
studying
the
composition,
the
values
of
light
and
dark,
the
methods
of technique, the
representation
of
details
and the
like, you
will obtain many ideas applicable
to your own work.
Do
not, however, attempt
to
imitate the style of any one man, as this will deaden
your initiative and be unfair to him as well.
Select,
instead,
from
the
drawings
of many
individuals
the
suggestions
that appeal
to you
personally, and
apply
these,
with
any
changes
that may
suggest
themselves,
to your own work.
It
is surprising what a variety of
ideas such an
analysis and
comparison
of many
drawings
will
reveal.
If we consider the width of
line used we
shall
find that some drawings are entirely made up
of very
fine
lines,
others
of broad
lines, and
still
others of solid mass shading.
In some, two or more
of these types of
lines will be found combined.
If
we
look
at
the kinds
of
lines we
shall
learn
that
some
sketches
consist
wholly
of
sharp,
crisp
strokes
;
others
of
soft "woolly"
lines
; some show
strokes almost mechanically perfect in contrast with
others having lines made with the greatest freedom.
If we
consider
the
values
of
light
and
dark we
shall see that certain drawings are left almost white,
others
rather
gray,
and
some
quite
black.
Most
drawings, however,
combine the
white, gray
and
black, as
all of these are usually necessary to prop-
erly
represent
the
values
existing
in
the
object
to
be drawn.
Considering
the
great
variety
of
work
to be
found,
it
is no small wonder that the student should
be
in doubt often as
to the best way of
treating a
given
subject.
In
such
an
emergency
our
good
friend Common Sense
is perhaps the best teacher.
Decide
first of
all just
what
the
purpose
of
the
drawing
is
to
be.
Some
drawings
best meet
the
requirements if left in outline only.
Others demand
careful shading of every part.
For a quick sketch
the roughest
sort
of
line
is often
just
the
thing,
whereas
a
fully
rendered
drawing
sometimes
re-
quires
that
every
stroke
be
painstakingly
made.
For most architectural purposes firm, sharp strokes
are
better
than
rough,
"woolly"
ones,
for
firm
strokes seem to best represent solid or smooth mate-
rials.
Soft,
yielding
materials
might
perhaps
be
better suggested by rough,
soft lines or tones.
Architectural
pencil
sketches are often shown to
the
client
in
conjunction
with
the
instrumentally
drawn
plans and
naturally harmonize
better
with
these plans
if
sharp
and
clean-cut.
The
student
should not
take
this
to mean
that
such
sketches
should appear too mechanical,
for the
fact
is
that
the average draftsman
uses
far
too
little
freedon;
in
his freehand work.
It
is sometimes
difficult for
him
to remember
that
he
should
not draw
every
brick
and
stone,
every
modillion
and
dentil,
but
that
he
should
learn
rather
to
suggest
and
in-
dicate
these
things
in
a
clear,
"snappy"
way.
It
is
in learning how to thus suggest
detail that
perhaps the greatest benefit can be gained through
the study of good
pencil reproductions.
It should
be
remembered,
however,
that
such
reproductions
have as
a
rule been reduced
in
size
considerably
from the original drawings, and the student should
take
this
into account.
Many
reproductions show
drawings apparently made with very fine lines, while
in
reality
the
lines were
several times
as
large
as
the
reproductions
suggest.
Needless
to
say
it
is
a
foolish waste
of time
to attempt
to cover
large
areas of paper with
fine
lines
when
broad
ones
answer as
well,
yet many draftsmen get the
habit,
possibly
because
they
are accustomed
to
working
with a sharp point, of making more tiny lines than

PENCIL SKETCH OF DURHAM CATHEDRAL BY KENNETH CONANT

78
SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
are necessary.
Partly
for
this reason
it
is unwise
for the
student
to
devote
too much time
to copy
work from plates.
When working from nature or
the photograph
there
is
far
less
tendency
to
fall
into
finicky ways.
On
the
other hand, some
stu-
dents make
drawings
so
sketchily
and
carelessly
that they fail to meet the usual architectural require-
ments.
Warning
should
be
given
that
there
is
a
vast
difference between the rough,
scratchy sketches
of
beginners and the apparently carelessly made draw-
ings by well known men.
Some students
feel, evi-
dently,
that
the
road
to
success
lies
through
imi-
tating
this extremely sketchy
sort of work.
They
fail to realize, perhaps, that these men have learned
accurate drawing
in
the past, and that
it
is equally
necessary for them to acquire the ability to do care-
ful work before they can make rough sketches
in-
telligently.
An
art student,
visiting a
collection
of
lithographs
by
Mr.
Joseph
Pennell, was
heard
to
remark that he could "take a chunk
o' charcoal and
do
as
well."
Doubtless
this
student was
ignorant
of the fact that during a period of many years Mr.
Pennell made hundreds of
illustrations of
architec-
ture,
almost
photographically
accurate
in
their
drawing and wonderfully
delicate
in
their
render-
ing.
These years
of
training make
it
possible
for
Mr.
Pennell
to produce
his
lithographs
in
a very
broad,
bold
way,
with
remarkable
directness
and
freedom, but his
earlier work offers more of assist-
ance to the beginner.
This
brings
us
to
another
fact
:
that
a
man's
style
of
rendering usually changes with
the
years,
as
the
best
of men
are
constantly
striving
to
im-
prove, with the result that they gradually alter their
manner
of work.
This
fact
should
help
to make
clear the folly of the beginner attempting to at once
arbitrarily make
a
"style"
of
his
own.
If
he
is
content, instead, to do his work as well as he knows
how, searching for truth
in drawing and an honest
interpretation
of
nature's
values,
studying
all
the
while
other
drawings
in
order
to
benefit
by
the
experience gained by other men, and seeking always
for the
best way
to meet
the requirements
of
the
problem
at
hand,
he
will
unconsciously
develop a
method
or
style
expressive
of
his own
individual
self.
It
is
impossible
to
over-emphasize
the need
for
constant
practice
if
one
is
to
acquire more
than
ordinary
skill
in
drawing.
Many
students
with
considerable innate ability
fail to make the best use
of
it because of
their lack of
interest or persever-
ance,
whereas
others, who show
at
first
far
less
natural talent, but who are endowed with an aspira-
tion to achieve dexterity and with a willingness
to
work for
it, often gain such
skill as to far outshine
those
students with
greater inborn
aptitude.
It
is
deplorable
that
so many persons
fail
to make
the
most of their natural abilities, but
it
is, on the other
hand,
most
gratifying
to
find
others
who
force
themselves
to
the
front
through
their
persistency
and commendable
effort.
The drawings
illustrating
this chapter
should be
carefully studied as they show a variety of excellent
individual
treatments.
The
originals
of
most
of
these were done entirely with pencil, though that by
Mr. Eggers on page 79
(which
is, by the way, re-
produced at the exact size of the original) had light
washes of water color added to the pencilling, while
that by Mr. Long on page 87
is really a color ren-
dering rather than a pencil drawing.
In
this
latter
example, however, the preparation
for the coloring
was done
in pencil, so the reproduction
is shown as
an
illustration of a style of work in which the pen-
cil
plays
a
by no means
unimportant,
although a
rather inconspicuous
part-
It
is
of
interest
to
mention
that
the
charming
drawing
by
Mr.
Eggers,
to
which we
referred
a
moment ago, was made from
his window
in Milan
in
1912, when
he was
studying
as the
first
holder
of the LeBrun Travelling Scholarship.
His sketches
on pages 80 and 82 were also done at about the same
time,
and
are
reproduced
here
directly
from
his
sketch book, and with the exception of
that
at the
top of page 80. showing Notre Dame, they are at the
exact
size of the originals so as to convey the tech-
nique as
faithfully as possible.
The
drawings
by
Mr.
Conant
on
pages
77,
81
and
83, show
a keen
sense
of
appreciation and
a
sound knowledge of architecture, as well as remark-
able
skill and sensitiveness in drawing, and they are
worthy of the most careful study.
On page 84
is a sketch by Andre Smith, which
is
notable
for
the
direct method
of drawing and
the
production of a wide range of values by
skillful use
of a very delicate
line.
The freshness of the draw-
ing
is due
to
the
artist's
habit
of working
rapidly
and making a drawing at a single sitting.
The sketch by Mr. Maginnis on page 84 is handled
in
a
masterly manner,
conveying
very
delightfully
the character and
detail
of an
interesting architec-
tural
subject.
In
the drawing on page 86 Mr. Watson has been
very successful
in rendering the structural
strength
and
comparative
lightness of one of New
York's
great
modern
bridges,
and
the
activity
along
the
water
front,
and
in
suggesting
the
shipping
by
means of smoke clouds, wisps of steam, a stack and
a spar or two.
Compare these drawings with those
of a
similar
nature in other parts of the volume or with examples
which you may have at hand, noting the differences
in
individual
style that such a comparison
reveals.

Chapter IV.
METHODS AND LIGHTING
AS
WE are unable to
fully and exactly repro-
duce by means of pencil drawings,
all of na-
ture's
intricate
form,
her
complicated
light
and shade, and her varied coloring, we are forced to
adopt certain conventional methods for their sugges-
tion and
indication.
Of
the
numerous
conventions
thus
employed
outline
is
perhaps
the
one
most
commonly
used.
Natural
forms,
it
should
be
understood,
have no
definite
outlines.
We
are
able
to
distinguish
ob-
jects one from the other only because of
their con-
trasts
of
light
or shade
or shadow
or
color.
To
demonstrate
the
truth
of
this,
study
the
objects
about
you,
and you
will
see
that
each
is
visible
only because
it
is light against dark or dark against
light or because one color
is contrasted with a dif-
ferent
one, but never because
it has an
outline.
Tt
may by chance have a border of some strong color
or tone which
at
first glance seems
to be an
out-
line, but closer inspection will prove
it to be merely
a
narrow
tone
of
light
or
dark
or
of
color,
so
small as to appear as a
line.
Cracks between
floor-
boards,
for
instance,
often seem to be the outlines
of
the
boards
themselves,
but
in
reality we
see
these
cracks
only
because
they
form
shadows
or
because they are
filled with
dirt or other materials
of a color or tone
different from that of
the wood
itself.
Streaks of highlight along the edges of ob-
jects
frequently appear
to
be
outlines,
too,
unless
the source of light causing them
is hidden or moved,
when they either disappear or change their positions.
Granting,
then,
that nature employs no
real
out-
line,
it
is
remarkable
that
her
forms
can
be
so
quickly and accurately suggested by
its use.
Even
a
child,
as a
rule,
is
able
to so indicate objects by
a
few
simple
profiles
that we
can
recognize them
easily, and
primitive
peoples,
ages
ago, made
out-
line drawings which we are able to read and under-
stand
with
little
effort.
Because such drawings do
indicate
form
simply and
directly,
it
is
important
for the student to learn
to make them well and he
should
frequently
practice
this form of work.
By
varying
the
lines
used,
the
textures and
materials
represented can be more accurately and
artistically
suggested
than
at
first
seems
possible.
Shadow,
too, can
be
indicated by
darkening
such
edges
as
are turned away from the
light.
Outline drawing
has,
at the same time, so many limitations that for
architectural purposes
it
is mainly valuable
for the
suggestion of
form.
Therefore whenever we wish
to do more than simply indicate the light and shade
or
color we
are
forced
to
either
supplement
the
outline by the
addition
of tones
of gray or black,
or
to
do away
with
it
entirely,
representing
the
object wholly by values of light and shade, approxi-
mating as
closely
as
is
possible those tones found
in nature
itself.
At "A,"
Figure
21,
is a
sketch of an old chim-
ney
done
in
outline
only,
but
this
outline
is
so
accented
as to suggest
the textures
of
the various
surfaces and a few tiny
lines are added also as an
indication
of
the shade and shadow.
At "B"
the
same chimney
is shown
in
full
tone
of
light and
shade but with the
outline omitted.
This drawing
is much
like
a photograph of
the same
subject,
in
that
the
stone and brick and
other
materials have
been given tones
as
similar as
is
possible
to those
appearing
in
nature.
Though
this
type
of
draw-
ing
is used to some
extent,
it
is not as popular as
that shown
at "C"
in which much of
the white of
the paper
is
left.
Drawing "C" not only has more
character than "B" but the method used
is a more
economical
one.
In
this
particular
instance
the
outline
was
drawn
exactly
as
at "A" and
then
enough
tone added
to
suggest
the
values
of
light
and shade as found at "B."
For architectural work
this method
is
quite
satisfactory,
for much
of
the
form can be
represented by
the
accented
outline
;
the
white
of
the paper
answers
for
the
lighter
values and the darker tones can be drawn with the
gray
and
black
of
the
pencil.
Color
cannot,
of
course, be more than suggested in any pencil draw-
ing.
A
dark
red
brick
wall
can be shown
dark,
and
light
green
shutters
can
be shown
light,
but
unless
explanatory
notes
are added
or some
color
employed
there
is no way
of making
it
clear
that
the brickwork
is
red
and
the
shutters
are
green.
Because of these limitations, tints of water color are
frequently washed
over
a
pencil drawing and
the
results
obtained
in
this way
are
often very
effec-
tive,
especially
if
the
tints
are
light
and
delicate.
Colored pencils are sometimes used,
too, with con-
siderable
success.
Figure
22
is
one
sketch
in
which
the
effect
is gained by the use of values representing the color
and tone of the various building materials and
ac-
cessories,
little
attempt
being made
to
show
the
shadows.
It
is sometimes possible to obtain a very
pleasing result by
this means and
it would be well
for
the
student
to
try
a
few
such
drawings,
but
the
average
subject demands
some
suggestion
of
the shadow tones as well.
Many drawings, can,
in
fact, be entirely made by the use of the shade and
shadow tones only, the color of the building mate-
rials
being
largely
disregarded,
and
the
lower
sketch, Figure
22,
is shown to
illustrate this point.
This method
proves
especially
useful when draw-
ing objects made of
light colored materials such as
carved white marble, ornamental
terra-cotta, white
clapboarded or stucco
walls,
etc.
Although
the
natural
tone
and
color
of
mate-
rials in buildings and their surroundings
is of great
importance,
so much
of
the
effect
of
a
structure,
both
as
a
whole
and
in
detail,
depends
on
its

SKETCHING AND RENDERING

The Upper Sketch Shows an Effect Mainly Gained by the Use of Values Representing the

In the Lower Sketch the Effect Depends
More on the Indication of Shade and Shadow.

METHODS AND LIGHTING
91
shadows that the study of
light and shade deserves
special attention.
When a sketch
is in outline only,
the
light
is either indicated
in a simple manner or
entirely disregarded, but when
a drawing
is
to be
done
in
full
values
it
is
especially
important
to
determine
both
the
source
of
the
light
and
the
direction
in which
it
is coming before
starting
to
render.
Students
have
been known
to
cast
the
shadows on a building
in one
direction and
to
in-
dicate
the shade on
the
trees
as though
the
light
were coming
at
a
different
angle.
Such
inconsis-
tencies are amusing,
but warning should be given
that they are almost
sure
to
occur when
students
attempt to copy and combine parts of several draw-
ings by other men or even make original drawings
of
their own unless the matter of
lighting
is
care-
fully
thought out before
the
pencil
rendering
is
begun.
Such mistakes show
that the student can-
not give too much study
to this subject
if he
is
to
avoid many
similar
errors.
There
are,
however,
so many
separate
influences
affecting
the
lighting
-of
all objects, such as
the condition of the atmos-
phere,
the
reflective
or
absorbing powers
of
dif-
ferent surfaces and materials, the constant shifting
and moving of clouds and
foliage, that
it seems un-
wise to attempt here to give the student more than
a few hints to point the way
for his
further
indi-
vidual
study.
Even
in
interiors
the
light
often
comes from so many sources and
is
reflected from
so many surfaces
that nothing but constant
obser-
vation and sketching will teach the student what he
should know of
such
conditions.
The opening
or
closing of a door may be sufficient to entirely change
the appearance of an
interior and
in the same way
the shifting of a cloud may cause windows viewed
from without to appear very
light one minute and
almost
black
the
next.
Sometimes
the
lighting
varies
to
such
an
extent
that
an
entire
building
may appear dark against light at one time and light
against dark
at
another,
as was
illustrated
in
the
example of the
lighthouse
in Figure
19.
Such an
extreme change
as
this, though by no means
un-
usual,
generally
takes
place
at morning or
in
the
evening
or
under
exceptional
lighting
conditions,
but even the average building under normal condi-
tions
will vary greatly
in appearance from hour to
hour.
Because
of
these
constant
changes most
buildings
appear
to
better
advantage
at
certain
time of day than
at
others, and
so
if drawings of
them
are
to be made
it
is
naturally
best
to make
them
during
these
favorable
moments.
Buildings
and
foliage
usually
get
the most
satisfactory
light
during the
late afternoon when
the
sun's
rays are
so
slanted
as
to cause
an
interesting
variety
of
shade and shadow, but
there are
of course excep-
tions to this, a great deal depending on the location
of the building in relation to the points of the com-
pass.
Many
architects
fail when
designing
build-
ings
to
give
sufficient
attention
to
the
fact
that
a
design
which
will
appear
well when
turned
at
a
certain angle with the sun or other source of illumi-
nation, may be much
less
effective placed
in some
other
position.
It
is
not enough
to make
instru-
mental
studies
of
buildings, with shadows
cast
in
the
usual 45 degree
manner,
but
in
addition
the
designer
should
consider how
the
structure
will
appear under
the
vertical
rays of
the sun
at mid-
day or
the
slanting rays
of
early morning or
late
afternoon, and should, in many cases, make
special
studies with the shadows shown as they would exist
in the completed building.
The author has in mind
one
particular
public
building
which
was
most
attractive
in
the
preliminary
drawings,
with
its
shadows cast in the conventional manner.
Unfortu-
nately
the
building
is
so
situated
that
for months
at a time the sun seldom shines on the main facade
and
in
the
evening
this
faqade
is
especially
unin-
teresting
when
the
bright
light
from
the
street
lamps entirely eliminates the cornice shadows.
Ob-
viously
it
is
impossible
to
foresee and prevent
all
such unpleasant
appearances,
but
the
student who
has learned
to study and observe
light
effects and
has drawn much from nature
will
find the knowl-
edge gained from
this work of great assistance
to
him
if
he
is
called
upon
to do
original
work
in
design,
both
in avoiding
such
unpleasant
results
as we have mentioned and
in making the
greatest
use of the lighting conditions as they
exist.
Such
knowledge
is
of
great
importance,
too, when
one
is
called
upon
to
make
renderings
of
proposed
buildings
or
sketches
from memory
or
the
imagi-
nation.
Do not
for a moment think that
it
is our
inten-
tion
to condemn
the
practice
of
casting shadows
on
elevations
in
the
conventional
45-degree
man-
ner, for that
is not the case, as even the student of
freehand drawing can gain considerable knowledge
useful
in sketching through a course
in shades and
shadows.
What we do wish
to make clear
is that
the
draftsman
or
designer who
studies
light
and
shade
directly from
nature does not allow himself
to be handicapped by the man-made
rules govern-
ing
shades
and
shadows,
but
supplements
these
with
his knowledge
of
nature's own
laws, and
so
applies them all with far greater intelligence. We are
told,
for example, when studying
the
architectural
subject of shades and shadows, that those surfaces
in
a
building
which
are
turned
most
directly
towards the source of
light
will usually appear,
all
other things being equal,
the
brightest.
From
this
one might judge that
a shingled roof
receiving
di-
rect rays of
light from the sun would appear very
bright, and
in
fact
it often
does.
Not infrequent-
ly,
however,
such
a
roof
seems
very
dark under
these
conditions,
even
though
the
wood
of
the
shingles
be
light
in
color,
this
appearance
being
largely due to the
fact
that the horizontal
lines of
the
butts
of
the
shingles, which
'are
so turned
as
to
receive
little
light and
are
also,
beer use
of the
nature of their grain, often dark, show so black and
are
so
conspicuous
as
to
deepen
and
darken
the
effect
of
the
otherwise
light
tone.
The
rule
is
worth remembering, however,
in
spite
of such ex-
ceptions, as
is also the rule that the darkest, sharp-
est shadows are cast by the edges of the surfaces re-
ceiving the most direct light.
It naturally follows that
surfaces so turned as
to receive the
light rays
in a
slantwise direction will be
less bright than those
re-
ceiving the direct rays.
It
is true, too, that a shiny
surface generally appears brighter than a dull surface
of the same actual value and sometimes even a black
shiny
surface
will
reflect some
light tone and
so

appear
practically
white.
There are exceptions
to
this for a shiny, light surface may reflect some very
dark tone and thus appear nearly
black, and
like-
wise a smooth gray surface may appear either lighter
or darker than
it really
is.
In other words glossy
surfaces change in appearance with changes of light
to a much greater extent than
dull surfaces.
Even
light,
dull
surfaces,
however,
often
throw
much
brilliancy onto
other
objects
and
white
concrete
walks
or
terraces
or
driveways
sometimes
reflect
enough
light upon adjacent buildings
to
materially
affect
their
appearance,
as
such
lights
soften
the
shadow tone or even
cast shadows themselves.
While we might go on with such general hints as
these
it
is
hardly worth
while,
for
it
is
only by
observing nature at
first hand
that
the student can
gain much knowledge of
real value.
One excellent
way of studying constantly changing effects of light
on
a building
is by making
a
series
of
snapshots
from some
one
fixed
point
at
intervals
during
a
clear day and comparing
them
wHi
care.
Such
photographs
reveal much
of
interest and
value
to
the
observing
student,
especially
if
the
building
chosen be
rather
small.
It might be well to make
sketches from these pho'ographs as this would help
to
fix the idens
in the mind,
or,
if the student has
sufficient
ability
or
training
to
sketch
rapidly
di-
rectly from the building, he can possibly learn more
by making a series of sketches instead of the snap-
shots.
We have spoken of the
fact that
it
is sometimes
possible
to make an
effective drawing by
the
use
of shadows
only and sometimes by suggesting the
building materials alone, but
it
is more often neces-
sary to represent both the material and the shadows
in order to obtain a satisfactory drawing.
It
is not
always
easy,
though,
to
decide
just how much of
each
should be shown,
especially
when
working
from the imagination as the architect
is often called
upon to do.
This can, perhaps, best be determined
by making several
rough
studies on
tracing paper
directly over the outline drawing or by making two
or
three
small
sketches
similar
to
those shown
in
Figure
23.
These eight sketches
illustrate
the
fact
that
it
is often possible to get many fairly
satisfac-
tory
compositions
of
the
same
subject,
but
there
are usually one
or two which
are
better than
the
others,
'and
one
of
these
should
be
selected
as
a
guide for the final larger renderings.
It
is suggested
that the student make several similar small sketches
of some object from memory or the imagination as
practice in composition, and
it
is well to remember
too, that
in making drawings from the photograph
it
is often helpful
to try similar studies on tracing
paper
directly
over
the
photograph,
to
determine
how much
to omit and how
best
to compose
that
which
it seems essential to show.
It may be
well
to
repeat here
that the only way
to learn
to draw
is by constant
practice.
Reading
a dozen books on drawing might give the
student
many ideas, but unless such suggestions are carried
out they are useless.
If you bck the inspiration to
draw by
yourself,
it would
be
well
to
join
some
sketching class or engage a
critic
to help you with
your work.

Chapter V.
COMPOSITION AND DRAWING FROM PHOTOGRAPHS
MANY
draftsmen and
students easily acquire
the ability to satisfactorily represent small de-
tails of buildings like bricks and shingles and
even such larger parts as doors and windows, but the
skill
to compose
these
lesser
units
into a complete
and well-balanced whole is not so easily gained.
And
yet the student who
is unable
to pleasingly arrange
all the smaller parts
into a
fine composition
is
seri-
ously
handicapped,
regardless
of
his
cleverness
in
sketching each single detail, so though
it may prove
a
difficult
task
it
will
pay
him
well
to
earnestly
attempt
to
master
the
art
of
composition.
Even
though
it
is only through serious study and
faithful
practice that the necessary principles can be acquired,
once they are understood
it will be found that they
apply
equally
well whether
a drawing
be
large
or
small and whether
it
is hastily sketched or executed
with painstaking
care.
The
principles are valuable
also when using other mediums than pencil, such as
pen and ink or wash or color.
It seems hardly necessary to give here more than a
brief outline of the most important of these principles,
and
a few hints as
to what to do and what not
to
do, but
these
suggestions
should
be
supple-
mented by reading books on the subject such as
"Pictorial Composition," by H. R. Poore, A. N.
A., "Composition," by Arthur Wesley Dow, and
the
chapter
on
composition
in
John
Ruskin's
"The Elements of Drawing."
A study of such
books
will
show
a
difference
in
opinion
on
some
points,
for composition
is an
art
rather than
a
science, and
it
is impossible
to
lay down
exact
rules
as
to what should or should not be
done.
Perhaps the greatest value of such works
is that
they point out many pitfalls which
lie in the path
of the
artist, and by analysis
of the pictures
of
acknowledged
masters,
give
the
student
a
cer-
tain standard by which he
is able to judge and
criticise
his own
work.
Though
the
study
of
books
is very desirable, one should never forget
that drawing cannot be
taught by
rule, and
a
hundred lengthy volumes could do no more than
start one in the right direction and offer sugges-
tions to assist him in his progress.
As the word "composition" means the putting
together of things and the arranging of them
in
order, so as to make one unit out of them
all,
it
is
evident
that we must
first have good
things
to
put
together
if
the
final
composition
is
to
be
good. This means that in starting work we should
use extreme care
in the selection of our subject,
not only as a whole but in each of its parts.
Stu-
dents, more especially the beginners, seem to be
of
the
opinion
that
any
object
found
in
nature
is
a
satisfactory
subject
to
draw,
and
they
are
led
into
this
belief,
perhaps, by
hearing
state-
ments
to
the
effect
that
all nature
is
beautiful.
It
is
not
for us
to deny
this
but
it
should be
made clear that good pictures are not to be ob-
tained
ready-made
by
simply
copying
bits
of
nature
at random.
Amateur photographers
are
well
acquainted
with
the
fact
that
a
successful
photograph
is not often secured by simply point-
ing the camera
in any direction and making an
exposure
;
it
is necessary
to
give some thought
to the selection and composition
of the subject.
Experienced artists often do produce good draw-
ings by re-composing poor material, but the stu-
dent
will
avoid
difficulties
if he
chooses
either
something
which
is
well
composed
in
itself
or
which can be made so with few changes.
We have previously spoken
of the advantage
of using a view-finder when
selecting composi-
tions and wish to call attention again to its value.
Of
the
several types
in
general
use one which
we have already described as consisting simply
of
a
rectangular opening two
inches
or
so
in
length
cut
in
a
piece
of heavy paper
or
card-
board,
is especially helpful when working direct-
ly from nature.
By holding
it
in an upright
posi-
tion and
looking through
it
at
the
objects
be-
yond,
it
is very easy
to
select
interesting
sub-
jects and
to
determine,
too, how
large an area
or how much of an object or objects
it
is best to
show
to
give
the
finest
composition.
Again
it
has another use, for
if the student
is in doubt as
to just what slope should be given to a roof line
or
slanting
tree
trunk,
a
comparison
of
these
inclined lines
in the objects with the vertical or
horizontal
lines of the opening of the finder will
be
of
great
assistance
in
determining
the
correct
slope or angle.
The finder will help the student,
also,
to judge correctly the values
of
light and
dark as seen in nature,
for each tone of the objects
can be compared
in turn with
the value
of the
cardboard
itself.
The other commonly used finder or frame con-
sists of two "L" shaped pieces of paper or card,
which
will
give, when
lapped
as shown
at
1,
Figure
24, an
endless
variety of
shapes and
sizes,
and
it
is,
for this reason, much better than the
other
finder when
working from
photographs.
As
soon
as
a
pleasing
composition
has
been
se-
lected
this frame can be clipped
or pinned
in
posi-
tion on
the photograph and
left
in
place
until
the drawing
is
finished.
It thus serves to hide
those parts which have no relation to the sketch
and permits the eye to rest on the selected com-
position without distraction.

COMPOSITION AND DRAWING FROM PHOTOGRAPHS
97
Some
art students
carry a view-finder of the
kind
first
described
with them
constantly and
gain
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
and
useful
knowl-
edge
of
composition
by
studying
different
ob-
jects through
its opening.
In making one, cut
several spaces through your card instead of one,
if you prefer, of various shapes and sizes.
They
need not be large as the card can be held near the
eye
;
in
fact two
or three
small
openings
or a
single large one can be made in a finder of postal
card size.
Sometimes threads are fastened across
the openings from side to side and from top to
bottom
in such a way as to divide them
into a
number of smaller rectangles or squares.
Those
who have preference
for
this
finder
feel that
it
lessens the
difficulty
of
laying
out
correct pro-
portions when drawing from
nature,
just as
in
copying a photograph or enlarging a sketch the
work
is
simplified when
the
print or sketch
is
marked off into squares or rectangles.
Several
excellent
compositions
can
often
be
found for the same object or objects when viewed
from one point, by snowing more or less of the
surroundings,
just
as
a number
of
satisfactory
photographs can be secured.
Naturally,
too, an
infinite
variety
of
compositions
of
any
archi-
tectural object can be discovered by studying
it
from various positions and under different light-
ing conditions.
When working from the photo-
graph
several
excellent sketches can sometimes
be made from different portions of one print, es-
pecially
if the picture
is a street scene or a gen-
eral view similar to that of the Wye Bridge and
Cathedral,
published
below
on
this
page.
It
is easy to frame a number of attractive compo-
sitions on
this photograph and
it would be
to
the student's advantage to do
so.
Figure 25 shows
three sketches drawn from this very picture.
It
will be
noticed
that
no attempt has been
made
to
slavishly copy
the
values and
details
exactly as they appear on
the
print,
for
it
is
sel-
dom wise
to do
this, but
the
general
effect
is
indicated in a broad, simple way.
There
is per-
haps no
better manner
of learning composition
than by making such selections with
the
finder
and also such sketches as we have shown here.
For
this
reason
the
following
exercises
are
offered
to fix in the memory the ideas which we are con-
sidering.
First
of
all,
obtain
several
photographs
such
as street scenes or general views, each showing
a number of objects which might make pleasing
sketches, and with
the
finder frame on one
of
your prints some selection which seems to com-
pose
well, remembering
that
each
composition
should have a center of interest.
Remember, too,
that there should always be
a pleasing
relation
between the shape of the picture space or margin
line and the subject itself.
If, for example, a very
tall
building
such
as
a
skyscraper
or
church
spire has been chosen,
it
is as a rule best to draw
it on paper placed vertically or to frame
it in
a
vertical picture space, whereas a long horizontal
building or mass of buildings can usually be rep-
resented
to
the
best advantage when
enclosed
in
a
horizontal
manner.

SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
trated
in
Figure
24.
The
English
cottage shown
at
"1"
at
the top
of
the
sheet,
seemed, when
viewed
in
connection
with
the
nearby
trees,
to
demand
a
horizontal
treatment,
while
the
church tower at "2" suggested at once a vertical
handling.
A
group
of
buildings
such
as
that
shown at "3" usually calls for a horizontal space,
for
if the horizontal masses are more prominent
than the vertical the fact must be recognized and
expressed.
Thus
the church
at
"4"
is
given
a
long, low,
frame, but
if
its tower alone was
to
be shown the contrary treatment would be more
appropriate.
As a general rule
it
is well not
to
use circular or oval or triangular frames or mar-
gin lines on architectural drawings as such shapes
often have
little or no relation to the form of the
architecture itself. A square shape might be well
related in this respect and therefore might some-
times do, but from an artistic standpoint a square
is
usually
less
interesting than
any
other
rec-
tangle.
It
is even
true
that
certain
rectangles
are more pleasing than others.
One with a length
just twice
its width
is not
as
desirable,
for
in-
stance, as another which is one and one-half times
as long as
it
is wide, while even
this proportion
is
less
subtle and
hence
less
satisfying
to
the
eye than one about three parts wide and five long.
While discussing margin lines
it might be well
to mention
that
the
line
itself should never be
so black as to draw the eye away from the sub-
ject.
The width and tone of line should vary in
different drawings
so as
to always be
in harmony
with
the
sketch.
Again,
attention
should
be
called
to
the
fact
that
sketches
in some
cases
are
carried way
to
the
margin
lines
while
in
others
they
are allowed
to
fade
gradually
into
the paper, or "vignetted" as it is called.
In either
of these cases
if the exterior of a building
is be-
ing drawn
it will be found that the margin lines
need not be far from the building itself, with the
exception, perhaps,
of the
line at the
top, as
all
spaces
will appear much
greater
after they are
rendered than
before,
for such surroundings
as
are generally used add a
sense
of
distance.
If
too much space
is left in such drawings the land-
scape
and
accessories may
easily
become
too
prominent in relation to the architecture.
When
a selection has been decided upon and
framed
to
a good
proportion,
fasten
the
finder
to the photograph and then on very thin tracing
paper with
a
soft pencil make a simple tracing,
not in outline alone but in values, trying to give
the
effect
of
the whole
in
a
direct and
simple
manner, with
sufficient
accent
at
the
center
of
interest.
Do not spend more than
five minutes
on the sketch and then frame the same object in
a slightly different way and make a second trac-
ing.
Compare
the
two.
If one
is
better than
the other, why ?
Is
it because you have shown
more foreground
or
sky,
or because
the frame
has been
kept
of
a
size or shape
better
suited
to the leading objects?
Ask yourself such ques-
tions and then make perhaps
a third and even
a
fourth
sketch, comparing them
all with
care,
and
if one seems better than the others, make a
larger and more carefully finished drawing using
this last sketch as the basis of your composition.
Next try to find some entirely different composi-
tion
in the same photograph, using a new sub-
ject, and make another series of quick sketches
or tracings, and again compare them and analyse
each, trying always to learn by
this comparison
why one composition
is good and another
not.
Select a
different photograph and
repeat the proc-
ess,
or,
if
you
feel
that
you
have
the
ability
to
work in a similar way from nature, do so, choos-
ing a comparatively simple subject
so that each
sketch can be done in a few minutes.
One will encounter more difficulty when work-
ing from nature, for whereas on the photographs
the forms and values remain constant, in nature
the
values
are always changing and
the forms
more difficult to represent.
We have previously
had occasion to mention that subjects which are
full
of
interest and good
in composition during
some hours are entirely different under changed
lighting
conditions,
and
buildings
which
appear
to good advantage
at
certain
times
of day
are
much less pleasing at others.
This
is largely be-
cause the areas
of shade and shadow are never
the same for long.
Part of the time they nicely
balance one another so that the lights and darks
are
all
well
related.
At other times
too much
light
or
too much dark appears
at one
side
or
above or below, thus destroying the restful effect.
At some
hours,
too,
there may be
patches
of
shade or shadow so odd in shape as to prove dis-
tracting.
It
is therefore well to do your sketch-
ing during favorable moments,
if this
is possible,
returning,
if
necessary,
to
the same
subject
at
the same hour during a number of days
in suc-
cession until the study
is completed.
If a subject which
is otherwise good in compo-
sition
exhibits
a few unpleasant
features,
either
in
nature
or
in
the
photograph,
it
is
perfectly
legitimate to take certain liberties with them,
if
by so doing the drawing can be improved with-
out sacrificing the truth of the main idea.
Should
a
tree,
for example, seem a bit too small
in
re-
lation to a building, or too light or dark in value,
or should some shadow be too dense and black
or form
a displeasing mass,
it
is permissible
to
make such changes as seem necessary to improve
the composition providing the
final result repre-
sents
a
condition
which
might
be
possible
under
slightly
different circumstances, without the break-
ing of any of nature's laws.
In
landscape
painting
and
decorative
drawing
more
such
liberties
are
taken,
however,
than
are
permissible
in
most
architectural
sketching
or
rendering,
for architecture must as a rule be truth-
fully
portrayed,
the
changes
to
better
the compo-
sition
being made
for
the
most
part
in
foliage,
shadows, and the
like.
To illustrate this matter of
changes, we
have shown
in
Figure
25,
Sketch
2,
the dark boat in exactly the same position as on the
photograph.
This spacing is not wholly satisfactory
as
the
boat
seems
isolated
in
the
center
of
the
sheet,
attracting by
its placement
more
than
its
proper share of
attention.
In
such a
case as
this
it would be
better
to improve
the
composition by
moving the boat to the right or the left or
it might

COMPOSITION AND DRAWING FROM PHOTOGRAPHS
99
be
tied
into
the scheme by
the
addition
of
extra
lines
or
tones.
Amendments
like
this
are always
advisable, and
it
is also wise to omit from a sketch
such objects as have
little or no relation to the sub-
ject
itself-, and which,
for this reason, detract from
the main
idea which
the
drawing
is
intended
to
express.
This
means
that we
must
observe
the
"Principle of Unity," which requires that a compo-
sition must be a homogeneous whole,
all
its
parts
related and
so thoroughly merged and blended
to-
gether that they become a single unit.
In order to
secure
unity
in a drawing
only
as
much
of
the
material before us
is
selected
as
relates directly
to
the
subject
of
the
sketch.
Separate your
subject
from everything
else
that
is
visible, and
think
of
it as a single harmonious whole.
This rule applies
whether your subject be an entire building, or some
portion
such
as a dormer
window
or
some
still
smaller
detail,
a door knocker, for example.
Once
you have determined which of the ideas
are
to be
rejected as irrelevant, you must decide on the
rela-
tive importance of those which have been accepted
as
essential,
for
unity
in
a drawing depends
not
only on
the
selection
or
rejection
of
material but
on
its emphasis or subordination as well, for unless
each
detail
is
given
just
the amount
of
attention
that
is proportionate
to
its importance,
the compo-
sition
will not count as a complete and
satisfactory
unit.
Failure
to give
sufficient emphasis or accent
to the leading parts of a drawing causes
a
loss of
force
to
the
entire
composition and
in
the
same
way
neglect
to properly
subordinate
the unimpor-
tant
parts
leads
to confusion and
complication.
To
further
illustrate
this
principle
of
unity
let
us consider some simple objects found
in everyday
use.
An
ink-bottle,
a turnip and
a
vase
of
roses
might
be arranged
into
a
pleasing composition
so
far as variety of form and size and value are con-
cerned, but unity would always be lacking
in
sucli
a group
for these
objects
are
not
sufficiently
well
related
by
use
to
ever become
a
satisfying
single
whole.
It would be
equally
difficult
to compose
a
coal
scuttle, a hair brush and
a
cut
glass
pitcher,
but a comparatively simple matter
to form an ex-
cellent composition of
a
loaf of bread
partly
sliced,
with knife, plate,
etc., or of a garden trowel, flower
pot and package
of
seeds.
Fortunately
nearly
all
objects of an
architectural
nature
are
so
closely
related
that
little
difficulty
is
experienced
in
find-
ing things which go well together, so the delineator
of architecture has much less trouble
in this respect
than does the painter of
still
life.
Unity
in archi-
tectural
work
is
often
injured,
however,
because
certain
accessories a-e
too important
in
relation
to
the
architecture
itself.
It
is
not
inappropriate
to
show an automobile at the
curb
before
a Colonial
doorway,
but
if
it
is
indicated
so
large
in
size or
made so conspicuous
in any manner that
it detracts
from the doorway
it then prevents a perfect unity
in the sketch.
It
is mainly
for
this reason that in
rendering architectural drawings such accessories are
often left in what sometimes seems to the beginner an
unfinished
state.
Trees are shown in a conventional
and inconspicuous manner, clouds
are often
either
omitted
or only
lightly
indicated and shadows
are
simplified-
This
brings us
to
a
discussion
of
the
"Principle of
Balance" which
is
so
closely
related
to the principle of unity as to be really a part of
it
;
in
fact without balance there can be no
unity,
for
by
balance we
mean,
as
the
name
implies,
the
equilibrium or restfulness that
results from having
all the parts of a composition so arranged that each
receives
just
its correct share of
attention.
Every
part of a picture has a certain attractive force which
acts upon
the
eye
and
in
proportion
to
its own
power to
attract
it detracts from every other part.
If we find our interest in a drawing divided between
several parts,
if certain tones or
lines seem too
in-
sistent
or
prominent,
we know
that
the composi-
tion
is
lacking
in
balance and
likewise
lacking
in
unity as
well.
It
is impossible to give concise and
definite
rules
for
obtaining
balance
in
drawings,
mainly
for
the
reason
that
the
attractive
force
of
each
portion
of
a drawing depends on an
infinite
number of circumstances
which
are
variable.
A
short, straight line drawn near the center of a clean
sheet of paper has
a power
to
catch and
hold
the
eye.
Let
a
figure
"6"
or some
other curved
line
be drawn
near
the
straight
one and
even
though
they are of equal
size the curved line will prove the
more powerful attraction of the two.
In the same
way
a
star-shaped
form
or
a
triangle
has
more
strength
to
attract
than
a
square
or
rectangle
of
like
area.
This power
depends
not
entirely
on
shape, however, but on the value of
light and dark
as well.
Draw two squares on paper,
side by
side,
the one dark and the other
light and
if the paper
is
white the dark square will exert the strongest force
but
if the paper
is black the white square will jump
into
prominence.
Again,
the
attractive power
of
an
object
varies
in proportion
to
its proximity
to
other
objects.
If,
for
example,
a man
is shown
at small
scale
in a standing or
sitting position near
the center of the
sheet he
will receive considerable
attention
if by himself, but
if surrounded by other
objects he
will seem much
less
noticeable.
Then,
top, a moving object or one which suggests motion,
will
be
more
prominent
than
a
similar object
in
repose.
Let
a man
be shown
running and
he
is
seen far more quickly than
if he
is at
rest.
Objects
near the edges of the sheet or in the corners usually
arrest
the eye more
quickly,
too, than they would
if near the middle of the paper.
These examples
are
sufficient
to show
the
diffi-
culty
of attempting
to give
definite
directions
for
obtaining good balance.
The best suggestion we can
offer
is
that
the
student make
first of
all, as soon
as a drawing has been blocked out in
its main pro-
portions, a preliminary sketch such as we have de-
scribed. A painter
is able to make many corrections
in his work as he progresses, until excellent balance
in every part
is gained,
but
in
pencil
sketching,
where the nature of the medium and the limitation
of time demand that the work be done very directly
and with few changes,
it
is
difficult to make
well
balanced drawings
unless
the
artist or student has
had
considerable
practice
or
unless
preliminary
studies
are made.
Almost
invariably such
studies
save time and give results in the end that more than
justify the labor spent on their preparation.

COMPOSITION AND DRAWING FROM PHOTOGRAPHS

by way of additional precaution, as the
final sketch
progresses
set
it away
from
you
at
intervals
or
turn
i
upside down
or on end
or even
reflect
it
in a mirror so as to see
it in a reversed or changed
position.
When
so viewed the balance should
still
be good, and
if not the necessary adjustments should
be made.
If some part seems too prominent either
tone
it down
or accent other parts until balance
is
restored.
These
principles
of unity and balance which we
have
described
all
too
briefly
are most
important
as they apply
to
all forms of drawing and
design,
but we must leave them to offer a few suggestions
which
relate
especially
to
architectural work.
First
of
all,
in making drawings
of
architecture
strive
for an
effect
of
restfulness and
repose.
A
painter
of
birds and
animals
or
of
marine views
often
desires
an
appearance
of
motion,
but
care
must be taken not to suggest much movement when
drawing architecture,
for each building should look
permanent and solid and should appear to rest firmly
on
the
ground.
Avoid,
therefore,
any
effect
of
violent wind or of speeding automobiles or hurry-
ing
people.
If persons
are
indicated
it
is
well
to
have them walking
quietly
into
the
picture
or ap-
proaching
the
center
of
interest,
for
if
they
are
shown walking away from
the center towards
the
margin
line
the
eye
follows them and
the
balance
is thus disturbed.
There are, of course, exceptions
to
this.
If many people are shown, as
in
a
street
scene, they may be represented as going
in
all
di-
rections,
for the
sense
of motion
in one
direction
will be offset by that
in the other.
Figures of any
sort greatly injure a drawing, however, unless they
are
well drawn and
naturally arranged
into
effec-
tive groups, and so should either be omitted entirely
or represented well.
Figure 26
is designed to show certain displeasing
effects often found in architectural drawings, which
it
is best to try to avoid.
A reference to Diagram
1
will disclose that the foremost corner of the house
is
equi-distant from the two end margin
lines.
It
is seldom advisable to place a building in
this posi-
tion,
a
possible
exception
being a tower which
is
absolutely
symmetrical.
Diagram
3
illustrates
the
same
point,
while Diagram
5
applies
the
idea
to
an
interior, and
in both of these the effect
is some-
what
unpleasant.
Do
not,
then,
divide the picture
space
into two equal parts by having some impor-
tant line directly in the center.
Look again
at Dia-
grams
1, 3 and
5 and you will find that the horizon
line
or
eye
level
towards
which
all
the
receding
horizontal lines seem to vanish
is just one-half way
from top
to bottom of the picture
space, and
this
division
is
unsatisfactory,
too,
and
better
results
are obtained when the horizon or eye level
is either
above or below the center of the sheet.
In the same
way the sketch of the bridge at
3, Figure 25, would
be
better
if
the top
line of
the bridge was not
so
near the
center,
for here
the
picture
space
is
also
divided
into two nearly
equal
parts
by
this
line.
Again,
it
is
usually
well
to avoid many
opposing
lines of the same
slant or angle,
for variety
is
al-
ways desirable.
In Diagram
1 the lines at A, B, C
and D are
all of equal pitch.
This leads to monot-
ony.
The same
fault
is found
in
3 and
5.
It
is
better
to
so
place
the
building on
the
sheet
as
to
avoid
these
difficulties
and
Diagrams
2.
4 and
6
are
better
in placing than
1, 3 and
5.
Diagram 3
has other
faults.
First the perspective
is so violent
that
the building has the unstable
effect
of
resting
on
its lower
corner, and
the
crossed
lines
of
the
streets form too conspicuous a pattern with a tend-
ency
to
draw
the
eye
away
from
the
building
towards points A and B.
Diagram 4 has
a more
pleasing variety of masses and
the
interest
plainly
centers
in the main
building.
Diagram
5 shows a
fault
in that the two
visible wall surfaces are equal
in
size and shape, as are also the ceiling and
floor,
and
here,
too, there
is no
real center
of
focus,
for
the
eye jumps back and
forth between A and
B.
Diagram
6
is
better,
for
the
interest
undoubtedly
centers
at A, and even though there
is an impor-
tant mass at B
it
is toned down
so as to seem un-
important.
The
floor, too, has been made larger
in
mass than the ceiling, but the advantage thus gained
is
largely
lost,
for the rug
is unfortunately of
the
same
size on the drawing as the
visible portion of
the ceiling, so that this sketch could be
still further
improved by adding either more rug or more
ceil-
ing.
Diagram
7
shows
that when
a
room
is
so
turned
that we
are
looking
directly
at
one
of
its
walls
or
is placed
in
"parallel
perspective"
as
this
is
called,
similar
faults
may
develop.
Here
the
main
surfaces
are
all
monotonous,
the
interest
is
divided and the drawing made
still more unpleasant
because the receding lines exactly meet the margin
lines at the corners.
At 8 an attempt has been made
to avoid some of the
difficulties of Diagram
7.
The
little sketch of the dormer
is shown
to
illus-
trate an
important matter
of
composition.
When
drawing
small
details
care must
always
be
taken
that they do not seem to be merely suspended in the
air.
They should appear instead to be
attached to
a solid background or support, and one of the best
means of giving this impression
is by allowing each
sketch
to
fade out gradually
into
the
sheet,
show-
ing enough of the adjacent surroundings to give the
whole a sense of
stability and
strength.
If
at
all
essential, we
might
go on
with many
suggestions on composition
similar to
these which
we have given, but
if
the student
is interested and
really serious he
will take the time to
obtain addi-
tional
ideas
from
such books
as we have
recom-
mended.
The
student
is urged
to make drawings
of his own to illustrate and make clear
in his mind
any of the principles he acquires, for unless he does
so
it
is probable
that many
of them
will be
soon
forgotten.

Chapter VI.
GRADED TONES
CAREFUL
observation and study of objects in
nature,
as
well
as
those
contrived
by
man,
will
reveal one
fact
of
the
greatest
value
to
the student of drawing, and this
is that although
not a little of the beauty of such objects depends
on
color, on
profile and on the proportions of
the
various parts into which they are divided, more
of
it than we usually suppose
is caused by the
varying
light and shade
and
especially by
the
gradation
of
tones from
light
to dark
or from
dark to light.
There
are,
to
be
sure, some
objects
which
seem
to have no gradation of tone, each surface
being apparently
of
one
value
throughout, but
in
spite
of
such
exceptions
there
are
far more
"graded"
tones
in
nature
than
"flat"
tones
of
uniform appearance, and
it
is certainly true that
a graded tone has more interest and variety than
one of exactly the same value in every part.
It naturally follows that in representing nature
by
drawings,
graded
tones
usually
prove
of
greater value
to the
artist than do those which
are
flat.
Almost any object can be represented
satisfactorily
by
graded
tones,
whereas
many
objects,
especially
those which
are
rounded
or
curved, cannot be made to appear correct
if
flat
tones alone are used. We can, for example, make
a pleasing drawing of a square box, and,
if we
wish, have every tone graded.
It
is impossible,
on the other hand, to nicely represent a sphere
or an object of spherical form by the use of
flat
tones
only, unless we
resort
to a succession
of
small adjacent
flat
tones, each
slightly
different
in value from
its neighbor, and such a combina-
tion really
is, after
all, a graded tone.
If we try
to portray a sphere by drawing
its outline as at
"1,"
Figure
27, we
fail
to
give
our
picture
any
effect of convexity of form, and shading the en-
tire circle with a flat tone as at "2" gives no bet-
ter
result.
It
is only when we copy as well as
we can
the
gradations found on
such
surfaces
in
nature, as we have done
at
"3," that we ap-
proach
the
desired
effect.
In
fact we would
not
even recognize a sphere when placed before us
were
it not for this subtle grading of
its surface
tones, for without these gradations
it would ap-
pear simply as a
flat circular disk.
In the case
of
the
cylinder
and
cone
and
similar
rounded
forms
it
is perhaps a bit less
difficult to suggest
their shapes on paper without recourse to graded
tones
providing they
are drawn
in
perspective,
for when so drawn their forms can be fairly well
indicated even
in
outline.
If
a
real
feeling
of
solidity and roundness
is desired, however,
it can
best be obtained by the use of graded tones.
If
such
objects
are shown
in
elevation,
instead
of
perspective,
it
will
be
found
that
these
tones
are
absolutely
essential
for
their
successful
repre-
sentation.
Take for example the cylinder which
is shown
in
elevation
at
"4,"
Figure
27, drawn
in
outline
only.
In
this
form
it
appears
as
a
rectangle and seems
flat.
A smooth tone added
as at "5" is of no help, and
it is only when we use
the grades as at "6" that we get the real appear-
ance of roundness.
Now
just
as
the
surfaces
of
cylinders
and
spheres and
such
geometric
forms
depend
largely
on gradation of tone for a pleasing effect,
so,
in
architecture too, much of the beauty of the mould-
ings and ornament depends on similar gradations.
After all, the mouldings are mainly combinations
of curved surfaces, and
if these curves are pleas-
ingly designed the light and dark will be graded
in a satisfactory manner.
In fact these gradations
on mouldings so nicely express the profiles which
cause them that we are often able to judge the
curve of each moulding at a glance even though
its profile is not visible.
If the light
is favorable
we
are
usually
able
to name
every member
com-
posing
a
cornice
and
tell
its
exact
form
without
once
seeing
its
true
profile.
One
of
the main
reasons why a designer works so hard to produce
a
good
profile
for
a
cornice
or
similar
group
of mouldings is that he is seeking the most pleas-
ing arrangement of light and shade and shadow
possible, and knows
that an
excellent
profile
is
important, not as a thing in
itself, for
it
is seen
in
its true form only
at the corners or breaks in
a building, but as a means of obtaining the most
satisfactory
results
in
light and
shade.
A poor
profile usually means a poor cornice.
At
"7,"
"8," "9" and
"10," Figure
27, are
four
sketches
of
typical
architectural
mouldings,
drawn
in elevation, and with their tones graded.
For convenience their profiles have been shown
but even
if these had been omitted
it would not
be
difficult
to
visualize
the
correct
curves.
It
should be borne
in mind, however, that without
the use of graded tones
it would be impossible
to produce such effects of curvature.
Now just as
it is necessary to use graded tones
for
a
truthful
expression
of
the
curved
surfaces
of mouldings, they are obviously needed also
in
the representation of other rounded surfaces such
as those which we
so often
find
in ornamental
work.
Most ornament,
in
fact,
consists so largely
of curved surfaces of every possible shape that
it
would be very
difficult to represent
it on paper
without the use of some graded tones.
At "11,"
Figure
27,
is a drawing of a
rosette, nearly every
103

104
SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
surface of which
is curved, and therefore repre-
~sented by grades of light and dark.
Certainly an
object of such gradual curvature as
this can be
successfully
portrayed
only
by
equally
subtle
gradations of its values.
Balusters, columns, archways, round towers and
all
sorts
of
similar
architectural
objects
and
de-
tails require a certain amount of graded shading.
At ."12"
and
"13,"
Figure
27,
a
baluster
and
a
capital are shown.
Even though drawn in eleva-
tion the rounded effect is very evident.
Had they
been done
in
perspective
less
care would
have
been
needed
in
the
shading
to
express
roundness,
but
for architectural purposes
it
is
often neces-
sary
to work
in
elevation
and
therefore
these
sketches have been done in that manner to prove
that
it is not essential to show objects in perspec-
tive when a feeling of projection and curvature is
required.
In order to
illustrate the points under discus-
sion
in
the
clearest
possible manner
the draw-
ings
on
Figure
27
have
been
done
with
very
evenly graded
tones,
for by
this means
the
values
as
found
on
the
objects
themselves
could
be
more accurately represented than by
the use of
tones
built up
of separate
lines.
As
a
general
rule, however, such smooth tones are not needed,
for much
the same
effect can
be
arrived
at by
forming them of lines just touching, in the usual
manner,
and
the
result
is
less
mechanical
or
photographical
and
hence
more
desirable.
At
"14" a few suggestions are offered for the forma-
tion of graded tones by individual strokes.
(It
is
suggested that the student make a few drawings
similar to these on
this
plate, trying some with
the smooth tone and others with a more sketchy
handling.)
It
should
be remembered
that
although
the
exact form which the gradation
of
a tone takes
depends
largely on
the curve
of the
surface,
it
really owes
its
effect to the
light which causes
it
to be
visible.
If we had no
light
the most
perfect mouldings would be
lost
in
darkness
if we have too much
light their beauty
is
often
destroyed.
The
author
has
in
mind
a
certain
coffered
ceiling
of
unusual
beauty.
After
this
ceiling had been
in existence
a number of years
and had been much admired,
it was decided
to
install a new indirect lighting system in the room,
and this was done.
The system was so arranged
that the light was uniformly distributed over the
ceiling in such a way that nearly
all of the shade
and shadow was
destroyed.
The
lighting
en-
gineers pronounced
the
job
a
perfect
one,
but
from an artistic standpoint the effect of the ceil-
ing was ruined
; the mouldings and
detail were
barely
visible
while
the
few shadows
that
re-
mained
took
weird and
grotesque
shapes
of
a
most bewtldering nature.
In this case too much
light, or rather light
distributed
in too uniform
a manner, destroyed the
effect.
This
all goes to
prove that even a beautiful curve may lose much
of its value through unfavorable
lighting, and
it
shows also that the gradation of tone on any given
moulding or curve varies with changes
in
light.
Spheres and
cylinders, for example, do not
ap-
pear the same at
all times and hence cannot al-
ways be represented in the same way.
It should
be remembered,
too, that the gradation
of tone
on any given form, take a cylinder for example,
depends not a
little on
the nature of the
material
of which the object is made.
A study of a num-
ber of cylinders of equal size and of various ma-
terials such as wood, plaster, polished white mar-
ble, sandstone, red granite, brass, silver, etc., will
reveal, even under the same conditions, a surpris-
ing difference
in
the values and the method
of
gradation
of
the
tones.
Those
cylinders
with
highly polished surfaces will show a greater com-
plication
of values and much sharper and more
sudden contrasts, as a rule, mainly because their
surfaces
serve
as
curved mirrors
to
reflect
dis-
torted images
of
other
objects.
Such
surfaces
usually have
brilliant
highlights
in
spots while
those of the wood or plaster or other dull appear-
ing
objects
will
not
only
lack
these
highlights
but
will
show
throughout
a more
simple
and
gradual change
in
tone.
It
is because
of such
conditions
as
these
that
there
can
be
no
definite
rules
given
as
to just how such
objects should
be represented.
Observation
and
study
will
give
the student the desired knowledge.
We
have, up
to
this point, spoken mainly
of
graded tones as found on curved surfaces, yet
it
should be realized that smooth
flat surfaces often,
appear to grade from one part to another.
Prove
this to yourself by observing objects around you.
It
is especially true that on surfaces indoors, where
the
light
is
frequently coming from
a number
of
sources and
is
all
more
or
less
diffused, we
find many
tones which
are
graded.
A
ceiling,
for
instance,
often
appears
light
at
one
side and
dark at the other, but
it
is
in the shadow tones
especially that we
find a great amount of grad-
ation.
As a rule the shadows of objects indoors
seem
the
darkest and
have
the
sharpest edges
near the
object casting them.
A
chair
leg,
for
example,
usually
casts
a dark shadow where
it
touches the
floor, but
this shadow
softens
as
it
gets
farther
from
the
leg
and
soon
disappears.
The
little sketch of the pencil touching the paper
at
"1,"
Figure
28,
was
made
to
illustrate
this
point,
the
shadow
being
the
darkest
at
"A,"
softening as the
light becomes more diffused to-
wards
"B."
In
brilliant
light,
such
as
bright
sunshine, the opposite effect
is often found.
Let
an
object
project
from
the
wall
like
the
little
cornice shown at "4" and the lower edge of the
shadow as
at "B" frequently seems sharper and
darker than the edge nearer the object as at "A."
Such an effect is as a rule only an optical illusion
for unless there
is something to cause a strong
reflection
of
light into the upper portion of the
shadow
the
tone
is
usually
of
equal
value
throughout.
The effect of darkness towards the
lower edge
is due to the fact that sunlight
is so
extremely
brilliant that when
it
falls on a
light
wall
or
similar
surface
it
produces
a value
so
bright
that
it
is impossible
for us
to
correctly
represent it on paper, and so when a shadow tone
cast by some
object
similar
to
the
cornice
at
"4" falls on this bright surface the tone appears,

in
its relation to the bright surface, darker than
it really
is.
A shadow may be a medium gray
if compared with black but
if
its lower edge
is
thrown into sudden and sharp contrast with ex-
tremely
brilliant
light
it
often
seems
actually
black.
In drawing shadows,
therefore,
there
is
a legitimate reason
for such
a gradation
as we
have shown
in
the
sketch
"4,"
as
this method
causes the white of the paper to appear brighter
than
it otherwise would, and therefore
to more
correctly represent the
sunlit
surface.
The
ligh'.er
shadow tone above
also gains, by
this gradation,
a
quality
of
depth and
transparency.
There
is another use
for graded tones which
is
of
the
greatest importance and
this
is
to
so
employ them as to give a sense
of distance and
of detachment or separation of one object from
another.
We
can perhaps
best explain
this by
reference to sketches
"5," "6" and
"7," Figure
28.
Objects
in
nature,
even when
they
are
of
the
same value, can usually be
easily distinguished
one from another because of differences of color
or by their motion or in a number of other ways.
In
photographs,
such
objects,
if
(he
values
of
light and shade are the same or nearly the same,
often seem lost or indistinct.
Sketch
"5," made
from a photograph, shows at "A" just the condi-
tion which we describe
; the roof tone and wall
tone lack detachment
it
is hard to distinguish
one from the other.
In sketch "6" this same wall
tone
has been
graded back
to
light from dark
and at "A" the roof has been darkened.
The re-
sult gives us a much greater feeling of separation
the roof seems to come nearer to us and the
wall
tends
to
recede
as
it
should.
The edge
at "B"
still appears
just as sharp
as
it
did before
the wall was lightened towards "A,"
in just the
same way that edge "C"
in diagram "3" seems
as sharp or even sharper than the same edge
in
diagram "2" (because in "2" the edge "D" detracts
from "C" to a greater extent than
it does
in "3").
We therefore have about the same
relative con-
trast
in
sketches "5" and "6" between
(he wall
in
light and
the
wall
in
shade,
so
that
sketch "6"
is
not injured
in any way because of the changed
values
at
"A."
Sketch
"7"
is
another
and
very
emphatic
illustration
of the use
of graded tones
in
securing
detachment,
the
chimney
being
light-
ened towards the bottom and the roof darkened
towards
the top
in order
to gain
a
sharp con-
trast.
This method brings the roof forward and
carries the chimney back, and so gives an effect
of distance.
The idea
is, therefore, a useful one
to remember as
it can be applied
in many
dif-
ferent places in nearly every drawing.
In sketch
"1,"
for
instance,
the
horizontal
line
is
softened
as
it
goes behind
the
pencil,
thereby
bringing
the pencil forward.
Sketch
"8"
shows
a
similar
application
of
a
graded tone, for by darkening the cornice shadow
towards
the
nearest
corner
of
the
house,
that
corner
actually
seems
to
come
nearer.
This
method
is of even more value when
the wall
is
turned at a sharper angle, making the foreshort-
ening more acute.
Graded tones are of the greatest assistance
in
forcing the eye to any given portion of a drawing,
and
the
little diagrams "A" and "B,"
sketch "9,"
show two
methods
of
bringing
attention
to
a
desired
spot,
in
this
case
the dark
circle.
The
sketches really explain themselves.
Method "B"
is perhaps the stronger one for the dark tone at
"C"
in
sketch "A"
detracts
from
the
spot
itself.
Of
the two
little window
sketches
below,
the
second carries out the same idea represented by
method "B," the dark shadow taking the place of
the dark spot
in
the diagram.
The eye here
is
forced to the bright upper portion of the window.
The
first window sketch shows
in place of such
strong
contrast
a more
gradual
grading
from
dark at the top down to light.
Occasionally
it
is necessary to apply the idea
of separation or detachment
to such accessories
as fences and tree trunks.
In sketch 10 the fence
is so graded as to bring
it light against the two
dark masses of foliage and dark against the light
background.
When this same idea
is applied to
trees the trunks and branches often appear dark
against the sky, then are. graded to a lighter tone
against the background of hedge or other foliage,
and
sometimes
reappear
dark
in
contrast
with
the grass of the lawn.
Just
as graded
tones
prove
of
value
in innum-
erable ways when
representing
small
details,
they
are
of
use,
too,
in
composing
entire
drawings.
Occasionally compositions
grade
from
dark
at
the
top
to
light
at
the
bottom
as
do
"1"
and
"3,"
Figure 29; sometimes they are
light at the top and
dark below like "4" and "6" on the same sheet.
These are
all rather extreme examples, however,
though
it
is
frequently the case
that drawings
combine
grades
in
two
or
more
directions.
Sketch "2"
in Figure 29,
for example, shows dark
masses of foliage behind the building which grade
away
to
light.
At
the
end
margins
there
are
opposing dark masses causing a sharp
contrast
which seems
to
set
the building back
into
the
middle-distance.
Sketch "5" also shows two sets
of grades, the one on
the building
itself, going
from
light
at
the
center
to
dark
at
the
ends
;
the other on the hedge, which, by grading in just
the
contrary
direction,
gives
contrasts
which
carry the eye towards the center of the composi-
tion.
Sketch "7"
is a further illustration of forc-
ing the
attention
to a given
point,
in
this
case
the near end of the building, by so grading the
walls that they are
left light at the end to form
a strong contrast with the
trees.
Drawings are
sometimes graded
off
into
distance
in
just
the
opposite way
that
is,
they
are
carried
from
dark
in
the
foreground
to
light
in
the
back-
ground.
In
fact
there
are
so many
places
in
which
graded
tones
are
found and
so many
uses
to
which
they may be
put,
it has been our main
purpose simply to
call attention
to their beauty
and enough
of their uses to give the student a
realization
of
their importance.
It
is
not
our
intention to give the impression
that
flat tones
should never be used, for there are instances
in
which drawings have been wholly done with
flat
tones with a remarkable degree of
success.

THE REPRESENTATION OF SMALL BUILDINGS
WE
HAVE already pointed out a few of the
many advantages to be gained through prac-
tice
in
pencil
sketching and
rendering.
It
is our
present purpose
to
further explain some
of
the
reasons why a knowledge
of
such work
is
of
value, especially to the draftsman anxious
either
to
better
his
position
or
to
build up a
practice
of
his
own, and to offer as well some practical suggestions
as a help towards this end, these suggestions relating
especially
to
the
representation
of
the simpler
sort
of building such as the small house.
It
should
be
remembered
that
the
average
client
who
comes
to
an
architect's
office
builds
but
once
or
twice
in
a
lifetime,
and
for
this
reason
is,
as
a
rule,
entirely
unfamiliar
with
the drawings employed in carrying on such work.
The instrumental plans mean little to him, though
he
can
read
them,
perhaps,
so
far
as
the
general
layout of the rooms
is concerned, and can under-
stand
the
elevation drawings
if
the building
is
simple
in
form,
but
let
it
be
broken
up
into
an irregular mass with numerous projections and
varying
roof
pitches
and
he
finds
it
impossible
to visualize
its finished appearance.
This
is not
to be wondered at for even experienced designers
and architects are sometimes surprised when they
see
one
of
their own
buildings
taking
definite
form
on
the
site
;
with
all
their
training
they
are not always able to judge beforehand just how
the completed work will appear in relation to
its
surroundings.
Doubtless one of the main reasons
why
clients
are
sometimes
disappointed
with
their
buildings
when
finished
is
that
they
prove
entirely different from what they expected them
to
be,
for they have
not
really understood
the
architectural drawing's and
so have been unable
to judge
until too
late whether or not the sub-
mitted
designs were
satisfactory.
Unwilling
to
admit
this
inability or overconfident because
of
the
architect's words
of
assurance
that
every-
thing would come
out
all
right, they have
ap-
proved the designs and given word to go ahead
with
the work, when
they
actually had
very
little
idea as to how the completed structure would ap-
pear.
When such a building is finished
it is only
natural, then, that the client may be displeased,
but
if
so he
is much more
likely to condemn
the
architect than to admit any error or lack of un-
derstanding on his own part.
It
is
largely because
of
this
difficulty
of
ex-
pressing a building adequately by the plans and
elevations
alone,
in such
a way
that
the
client
will
fully understand the scheme, that the prac-
tice has grown of preparing rendered perspective
drawings which show
in
a very
clear manner
exactly how the completed structure will appear.
Such
perspectives
are
of
value
to
the
architect
in many ways,
for
they
not
only
serve
as
a con-
vincing
expression
of
the
problem
to
the
client
but are of equal use in his own drafting room as
a means of studying the design.
In addition to
this, new jobs are often brought to the office because
of
such
renderings,
submitted
to
some
possible
client
frequently
in
competition
with
work
from
other
architects.
Again, when an attempt
is being
made
to
raise money
to
finance
the
erection
of a
new
building,
such
a
perspective,
submitted
along
with
the
plans
and
specifications,
may
prove
of
the
greatest
service
in
obtaining
the
necessary
loan.
These
are only
a few of the uses
of perspec-
tive
drawings,
but
enough
to
show
that
they
are
of immense value
to the architect, and
this
being
true
it
is
only
natural
that
there
is
a
constant demand
for draftsmen who
are
able,
in
addition
to doing
the
usual
instrumental work
on
plans and
details,
to make such
renderings.
Men with the skill to sketch and render well are
almost
certain
to
advance
rapidly,
as
they
soon
come to the notice of their employer and are able
to serve him
in many important ways.
First of
all, when a new project
is conceived many
little
sketches are needed as a means of study.
These
are usually done freehand, in pencil.
Then as the
design
takes
more
definite
form,
accurate
but
simple instrumental
perspectives
are sometimes
laid out and over
these, on
tracing
paper,
the
designs are given further study, a few of the main
lines being perhaps drawn instrumentally and the
rest
free-hand.
With
these designs
quite
definite-
ly
settled,
a
carefully
finished
drawing
is
often
made
to
show
the
client,
done
instrumentally
and rendered in any desired medium.
After this
perspective, with
its accompanying plans, eleva-
tions,
sections and
the
like
has been approved
and
the
final
contract drawings
started,
free-hand
studies
are
frequently made
of
such
details
as
chimneys and dormers.
Then, after the contract
is
let,
another accurate
rendered
perspective
is
sometimes worked up, showing all the corrections
and changes.
Even while the building
is being
erected sketches
are
occasionally needed
per-
haps
to explain matters to the client
often to
make some detail clear to a contractor or work-
man, or again simply as a means of giving fur-
ther study
to
a
doubtful
point.
It should
not
be supposed that so many renderings and sketches
are needed for every job, for naturally everything
depends on
the
cost
and
nature
of
the
work.
Often no
finished
perspectives
are made and few
109

SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
sketches, on the other hand there are buildings of
complex design which require, in addition to sev-
eral
perspectives both
of the
interior and
exterior,
many ornament drawings, including such details
as carved
stone
or wood, wrought
iron,
leaded
glass,
etc.,
as well as
carefully
lettered inscrip-
tions.
All of these offer work for the man who
can
sketch and
render.
There
are,
to be
sure,
many professional delineators who are sometimes
called upon
to render the drawings
of
large or
unusually important buildings, but there are many
smaller jobs, such as suburban houses,
in which
the architect's fee
is not sufficient to warrant the
expenditure of any great sum for renderings.
It
is such jobs as these which usually
fall to some-
one in the
office and the man who
is capable of
doing them
is
often advanced
to
a
position
of
greater
responsibility with
its corresponding
in-
crease
in
salary.
There
is
another important advantage which
often comes from having skill in making sketches
or renderings
of
small
buildings,
for
it
is
true
that such drawings are frequently the
principal
means by which
a draftsman
is
able
to
obtain
his
first
commissions
as
an
architect.
Many
a draftsman has learned to his sorrow that
it
is
much
easier
to
open
an
office
calling
himself
an
architect and with
his name on
the
door, than
it is to induce clients to enter. When we consider
that
even
the
cheapest
of
buildings
usually
costs
a number of thousands of dollars, we can hardly
blame
the
public
for
failing to patronize young
and comparatively inexperienced men when older
and better known architects with many buildings
to
their
credit
are
willing
to
accept
the work
for the same
fee.
But the young architect must
get
his
start
in some way and
unless he
is
so
fortunate
as
to
have
wealthy
and
influential
friends
to shower him
with
their
favors
he
is
often wise to remain associated, perhaps as drafts-
man
or
designer,
with some
fairly well-known
firm,
and
to
gradually
build
up
a
clientele
of
his
own.
This may be done
in
a number
of
ways, one of which especially concerns us.
Some
of the
larger
firms do
not
care
to
bother with
small houses and the like and so frequently turn
any
clients
that
desire
this
sort
of work
over
to some draftsman or designer.
If such a drafts-
man
is
able
to impress
the
client favorably
he
is
quite
likely
to
get
the
work,
for
even
though
his experience as an architect may be limited his
connection
with
the well-known
firm
will
give
him
a
certain
standing.
There
is
perhaps
no
surer way of creating such a favorable impression
than by submitting attractive rendered drawings
showing
just how
the
proposed
building
will

look when completed.
Somehow people seem to
feel that
if sketches are nicely done the job
itself
will
be
executed
as
well, and many
times
the
man submitting
a
pleasingly
rendered drawing
done
in perspective will be given work, when
blue-
print plans and elevations from other architects,
showing a scheme of equal merit, will be ignored.
Perhaps you
are one of those draftsmen with
a desire to learn to make renderings of a quality
suitable for the average job but with the feeling
that
it
will never be possible for you
to do
so.
If this
is the case you should be offered encour-
agement, especially in regard to pencil rendering.
It
is
not
easy,
of
course,
to become
an
artist
in
the
true
sense
of
the word, and
a
half
dozen
lessons or a
bit
of study
will not make one an
expert, but on the other hand
it
is not
difficult
to master the few principles of composition and
tricks
of rendering which
are needed to enable
one
to do
a
creditable
sketch
for
the
ordinary
building.
The writer has seen many students of
only
fair
ability turn out excellent drawings
of
simple buildings after a comparatively brief per-
iod of training, though they often lacked at
first
the confidence which
is necessary
for success
in
this work.
Pencil rendering of architectural subjects really
is,
after
all,
comparatively
simple.
One
does
not
encounter
the
same
difficulties
as
when
working
in
color
for
there
are
only
the
values
of
light and dark to consider; neither
is
it
diffi-
cult
to make changes
as
in work with the pen.
Originality
is
not
looked
for
as
it
is
in some
forms of art work, nor
is
it necessary
to
strive
for
a
decorative
effect.
As
the
small
drawing
does not often need
figures or animals
it
is not
absolutely
necessary
to
be
able
to draw them
;
even
if
figures
are
to
be shown
they
are
usually
so small in scale as to need little detail.
The most convincing sort
of
pencil technique
for the usual architectural subjects
is the conven-
tional type such
as
is employed
in most of
the
offices, published examples of which appear from
time to time in all of our architectural magazines.
The student should collect such reproductions as
seem excellent and study them with care.
Better
yet,
if opportunity offers to see originals of -this
work
in the
offices
or the
architectural
exhibitions,
analyze them
thoroughly.
Notice
the way
in
which
the
various
details
such
as
the
doors
and
windows
are
indicated.
Study
the
methods
of
suggesting
different
materials
shingles,
clap-
boards, brickwork, stone, stucco, etc.
Look at the
way the foliage
is shown.
Copy either the whole
or portions of some of these, trying at the same
time to memorize the methods of expression.
It
is
valuable
also
to compare
the drawings with
photographs
of
similar
subjects
or
even
with
buildings
themselves, and
sketch
directly from
the
buildings, too, trying small drawings of doors and
windows or other similar portions
first.
Photo-
graphs of small houses
will
offer many sugges-
tions
for surroundings which
can be
copied
to
advantage-
As a help to the student we have intro-
duced
in
the
following
chapters
a
number
of
drawings showing certain methods of represent-
ing details of various sorts, but
it should be
re-
membered
that
it
is always
well
to
study
the
work of a great many
different people
in order
to adapt those ideas which appeal most strongly
to you.
After considerable
practice has been given
to
the drawing of
details, a
real rendering of some
small house may be undertaken.
It
is perhaps
well to remind the student that a rendering
is a
more carefully finished production than a sketch
;
that
whereas
a
sketch
is
usually made
rather
hastily,
a
rendering
is
more
in
the
nature
of
a
study
this
in spite of the
fact that many such
drawings
appear
at
first
glance
to
be
hastily
done.
In
order
to
gain
an
accurate
result
the
subject
to
be
rendered
is
first
laid
out
instru-
mentally directly from the plans and elevations.
This work
of course demands some knowledge
of the science of instrumental perspective.
The
few
facts necessary
for drawing the usual type
of
building can
be
acquired
easily,
however,
even
though one does not go deeply
into the theory
of
the
subject,
and many men
learn
simply
a
few "rule of thumb" methods which really answer
all
general
requirements.
It
is
not
within
the
scope
of
this
volume
to
give
instruction
in
in-
strumental perspective but there are a few points
which
it seems essential to cover as they relate to
both instrumental and
free-hand work, and concern
especially
the
composition
of
the
entire
sheet.
First of
all,
it
is wise when starting a perspective
to decide where
to stand
in order
to obtain the
best view.
Though this position varies with
dif-
ferent
buildings
it
is
usually
well
to show much
of
the main
faqade and
if
the
plot
be
flat
to take
the eye level or horizon line about five feet above
the ground, as the eye
is actually approximately
this distance from the plane on which the build-
ing
rests.
If,
instead,
it
is
to be on a
hill
so
it would be natural
to look up
at
it, that
is the
way
it
should
be
drawn, and
in
this
case
the
horizon would be way below the house
as
it
is
always level with the spectator's eye.
Contrarily
if we are to look down on the building from above,
as
in
a bird's eye view, the eye
level or horizon
will be towards the top of the picture.
Now
it
is seldom
that we do
see houses from
above, and
even
if we should, as from a mountain or airplane
it
would
not
generally
be
wise
to
show
them
that way, but there are cases where the building
is very irregular in plan or where we have a com-
plex group of buildings to picture and under these
conditions there
is sometimes no other means of
expressing
the
entire
subject
adequately.
An-
other point worth remembering
is that
it
is best
not to stand too close to a building when making
the
perspective,
as
this
causes
the
receding
lines
to become
so acute
as
to seem unpleasant.
A
little
experience
will
teach
the
correct
distances
for
various
types
of
buildings.
Again,
if you
are
to make a perspective and the
plot has
al-
ready been purchased, obtain either photographs
or sketches
of the
site
to
help you
in drawing
the surroundings.
A plot plan or survey show-
ing the contours of the

getting
a
layout
correct.
If
no
plot
has
been
selected, photographs showing houses of a sim-
ilar nature to that which you
are drawing may
offer valuable suggestions, especially for the en-
tourage.
It should be remembered that a pleas-
ing
relation
should
exist
between
a
building
and
its environment
the house should seem to
belong to the spot.
If, for instance, you are draw-
ing a
little
English
cottage
of informal
nature,
do
not
arrange
your
landscape
in
too
formal
a
manner.
Have
some
curved
walks,
irregular
hedges,
a
quaint
garden,
etc.
A
Colonial
house
of
dignified
proportions
demands,
on
the
other
hand,
a
more
symmetrical
treatment
with
formality
extended
throughout
the
scheme.
A
rustic camp in the forest should show a
real
forest
character and not look like a suburban cottage, and
if
a
house
is
to
be
in
Florida
do
not
use
trees
found only
in
the
North, and
likewise avoid
hills
and mountains
if the location
is
in a level country.
These are of course only matters of common sense
and may seem too simple to mention, but they are,
nevertheless, extremely important.
There
is some-
thing
else,
too,
which
helps
a
composition
im-
mensely and
this
is
to have some
line or group of
lines
such
as
a
path
or
drive
or
shadows
on
the
lawn or perhaps a succession of bushes, which will
serve
to
lead
the eye
into
the
picture.
In Figure
24,

V,

II.
it
will
be
noticed
that
all
four
of
the
sketches
have
paths
which
cause
the attention to be directed gradually to the center
of
interest.
It
helps a
drawing,
too,
if
there are
little vistas to draw the eye out of the picture again.
A glimpse of some distant lake or down
a pathway
to
the
garage
or
of
a
neighboring
building
seen
through
the
trees
will
add
value
to
the
picture,
though
naturally
care must be
taken
not
to make
these incidentals too prominent, otherwise they will
take
interest
from
the house
itself.
In
this
con-
nection we refer the reader to Figures 30 and 31
in
this
chapter.
The end
of
the
distant house
in
31
and the garage in 30 add to the effect.
When a defi-
nite
plot
has
been
chosen
such
buildings
as may
be visible should of course be correctly represented
if shown at
all.
Leaving the subject of composition for the pres-
ent,
let us return
to the consideration of
practical
points
relating to
the
laying
out
of
the
drawing.
Now after the station point
at which the spectator
is to stand has been decided upon and the eye level
or horizon determined, the various vanishing points
are
correctly
located and
the work
is under way.
As most perspectives are drawn
directly from the
working drawings and as these arc often at the scale
of one quarter inch
to
the
foot
this same
scale
is
frequently used
for
the
perspective.

rule about
this, however, but
it
is sometimes
diffi-
cult
to show enough
detail
if
a
smaller
scale
is
chosen.
The English house in Figure 31 was done
at the
scale of one eighth
inch
to the
foot and
is
reproduced here
at
the
exact
size
of
the
original,
so this gives a
fair idea of about what can be easily
done
at
that
scale.
The two houses
in Figure 30
were
also made
at one
eighth
inch but
are
repro-
duced at about one-half
that
size.
Once the
scale
is
decided,
the work of
the layout can be pushed
right ahead and as soon as this
is completed we are
ready
for
the
rendering.
There
are
several
cus-
tomary methods
of proceeding
with
this.
Some-
times the layout
is on common paper and then the
rendering done
on
tracing paper
placed
over
the
other.
One advantage
of
this
system
lies
in
the
fact that there
is no special need to keep the paper
clean when
drawing
the
layout
again
there
are
no hard mechanical lines to show in the final result,
and
if
the
rendering
is
spoiled
in
the making
for
any reason
it
is easy
to begin once more.
When
the drawing
is completed the tracing paper can be
smoothly mounted
on heavy cardboard.
Another
method, and the more common
one,
is to make the
layout right on the
final paper, using a
fairly hard
pencil
such
as
a
3H,
and
drawing
not
only
the
outline of
the large
portions, but
also
all the win-
dow
mouldings,
clapboard
lines
and
other
such
details
as
well.
When
this
is completed go
over
the whole with a soft eraser until the lines are just
visible
as
a guide
for
the
freehand
work.
This
final rendering may vary in style somewhat, accord-
ing to the subject to be drawn.
An English cottage
of hewn timbers and rough brick or stucco, roofed
with
thatch
or uneven
slate,
can be
done
with
a
rather
sketchy
line,
as
this
will
satisfactorily
ex-
press the irregular surfaces.
If a formal house of
cut
stone
is
to
be
pictured,
smoother
tones
and
straighter
lines
are
often
better.
This
does
not
mean
that
it
is impossible to
nicely represent such
a house by
a very sketchy
sort
of
line, but
it
is
certainly wiser for the beginner to render a build-
ing of
this character in a painstaking way.
With
these
facts
in mind you
are
ready
to
start work,
considering
carefully
the
direction
of
the
light,
casting
the shadows
with
care.
A knowledge
of
the subject of shades and shadows
is of course of
great
help
here,
while
photographs
of
similar
buildings
offer many suggestions.
Then a prelimi-
nary
sketch
is
often made on
tracing paper and
the
values
carefully worked
out on
that.
If
this
is done
it often seems
best, when making the
final
drawing,
to
render from
the
top down,
for
it
is
possible by this means to keep the paper clean quite
easily.
In
theory
it
is
better
to work
from
the
center of interest out towards the edges, as we have
stated in a previous chapter, or to put in the darkest
tones
first,
all
over the
drawing,
later adding the
half tones.
If no preliminary
is made, one of these
methods should be followed unless the student has
had
a
great amount
of
experience.
In any
case
there
is no excuse
for untidy work and
if reason-

able care
is used
to keep the drawing brushed
off
and
the
pencil wiped
clean,
with
a paper always
under the hand to protect the surface, there should
be no
difficulty from that
source.
Finish
the drawing
to
the
best
of
your
ability
and
if you are not satisfied with
it, and you are not
likely
to
be,
try another
of
the same or a
similar
subject.
It
is only by such practice, and by learn-
ing to look
for your own mistakes and to profit by
them, that success will be gained, but have
in mind
always that
it
is well worth the
effort.

the
difference

hastily and
in a

press
the general character of
the
building.

Chapter
VIII.
THE REPRESENTATION OF DETAILS
WE
HAVE now reached a point in our discus-
sion
of
sketching and
rendering
where
it
seems
advisable
for
us
to
give
additional
attention
to methods of indicating brickwork, stone-
work, clapboarded and shingled
walls,
slate and
tile
roofs,
etc., and
such
details
as chimneys, dormers,
cornices and doorways,
for
it
is plain that unless the
student
learns
to
nicely suggest
these various com-
ponent
parts he cannot hope
to make an
excellent
drawing of a building as a whole, any more than a
portrait painter can obtain a satisfactory likeness of
a person without a knowledge
of how
to draw
the
ear and
the eye and
the mouth.
These
repre-
sentations of chimneys and dormers and the like,
are,
in
other
words,
the
draftsman's
alphabet,
the A B C's that he should learn before attempt-
ing difficult compositions.
In previous chapters a few instructions of a gen-
eral
nature
for
the drawing
of
such
portions
of
buildings
have
already
been
given,
so
the
present
text
with
its
accompanying
illustrations
is mainly
an
amplification
of
these
earlier
suggestions.
If
repetition
is found
it
is because certain points seem
worth
repeating,
for the importance of
the
subject
is such that
it deserves elaboration.
Unfortunately
for
the beginner
there are few
definite rules to help him
in such sketching,
for
each
artist develops methods
of
his own which
he varies from time to time as he
feels inclined,
choosing
always
the
one
which
seems
appropri-
ate
to
his
particular
problem.
Naturally
his
manner of working
differs, too, according to the
size at which the details are to be drawn, for
it
is obvious that a window, for example, shown at
one-quarter inch
to
the
foot,
requires treatment
decidedly
different from
that demanded by
the
same object presented at a much larger scale.
Because there are so many methods of indica-
tion
in
common
use
it
is
not
strange
that
students
feel
uncertainty
as
to
just
how
to
approach
a problem
of
this
nature.
Of course
in
theory
it
is
best
to
turn
to actual buildings
and
to landscape
for
inspiration and
practice,
ob-
serving and sketching the desired details directly
from the buildings and their surroundings.
The
average student finds
it rather difficult, however,
to work
in
this way
without
considerable
prelim-
inary
preparation,
and
therefore,
valuable
as
such
practice
undeniably
is,
the
beginner
can
perhaps learn more at first (as we have explained
in
a
previous
chapter)
by
studying
good
draw-
ings,
copying
portions
of them
over and
over
aerain,
later applying the ideas thus acquired
to
similar original problems.
The
plates which accompany
this
text show
certain
methods
of
indicating
such
details
as we
mention and
it might be well
to make copies
of
some
of
these,
not,
however,
blindly
imitating
the manner
of
handling.
Give,
instead,
serious
thought
as to why they were done
in
this way,
for each
line and tone
should
be made with
a
definite
purpose.
As
these
sketches
offer only
a few of many possible methods do not rest con-
tent
with
copying
parts
of
them,
but
study
other
similar drawings and copy some
of them,
too,
in order to learn additional
tricks
of
indication.
In
all of this work
if you feel that you can obtain
equally
good
results
by
a
slightly
different
proc-
ess,
do
so,
for
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
to
reproduce the original from which you are draw-
ing
line
for
line,
so
long
as
the same
general
effect
is
gained.
If you
supplement
this copy
work
with
sketching
from
the
photograph
and
from nature, using both broad and
fine
lines, on
all
sorts
of paper and
with
pencils
of
various
kinds and grades, your
efforts
will surely bring
increased
skill and a natural individual style will
be gradually acquired.
It
is
usually
best
to
adopt some
standard
size
sketching paper,
the notebook proportion
of 8"
by
W/i"
being
convenient
for
the
smaller
sketches. A cover for preserving sheets of
this
size
can
be
secured
easily.
It
seems
advisable
to
re-
tain
all such sketches or at least the best of them,
for
this gives you the opportunity
to note your
progress
from
time
to
time, and
the drawings
themselves may prove of great help when mak-
ing
finished
renderings.
Group
a
number
of
sketches
of
similar
subjects
on
one
sheet,
so
arranged
that they permit easy comparison,
have,
for
instance,
sketches
of
chimneys drawn
with
a
fine
line on
one,
others done with
a broad
line on
another,
dormer
windows
on
a
third,
details
of
stonework on a
fourth, and
so on.
Before
proceeding with our discussion
of the
plates
it may perhaps be well to once more warn
the
student,
especially
the
architectural
drafts-
man, never to attempt to draw every tiny detail
that
he
knows
to
exist.
It
is
not
strange
that
one
so
familiar as he
is with
all
the variety
of
small units which go to make up a building finds
it
difficult
to
remain
free
from
the
desire
to
overemphasize
the
importance
of
some
of
them.
The
mere
fact
that
one
has
been
trained
to
ac-
curately
draw
each
detail,
whether
large
or
small, when making an instrumental elevation of
a portion of a building, acts as a hindrance when
it comes
to
pictorial
representation, where we
are striving to gain the effect of the whole in a
broad,
direct manner
in
a
comparatively
short
space of time.
As an illustration of the fact that
an
accurate instrumental
elevation gives
less of

THE REPRESENTATION OF DETAILS

the
true appearance than does a sketch
of the
right sort with the nonessential lines omitted or
subordinated we have made two drawings
at A
and B, Figure
33, of a typical cornice such as we
might
find at the eaves of a Colonial residence.
The one at A
is done instrumentally at the scale
of
1/2"=1'-0" and
is a copy
of an
actual work-
ing drawing.
Such a mechanical representation
as
this,
offers, of
course, an accurate statement of
certain
facts
of
form,
but
it
stops
there.
It
gives
us
a wrong
sense
of
the
values,
for
the
numerous
lines necessary
to bound
the various
members form
a dark mass on
parts which
in
the executed work might appear rather light, and
there
is
nothing
to show
the
difference
in
tone
between
the
brick and wood.
In
a
sketch
or
rendering, on the other hand, we
usually work
for an
effect of reality, and even though
certain
details
are of necessity
slighted, by means
of a
free handling we are able to suggest in addition
to facts of form, the light and the shade and the
tone and
texture
of
the
materials.
In
the
sketch
at B we have attempted such an
indication
of
the cornice shown at A, striving to gain approxi-
mately
the
same
relative
values
as
might
be
found
in
nature.
The brickwork
is shown darker
in
the shadow
than
in
the
light,
as
is
the
white
woodwork,
too, while
the
shingles
are
given
a
tone which
quite
accurately
suggests
the
color
that they might appear in the direct rays of the
sun.
As this particular sketch
is at a fairly large
scale
it has been
possible to
retain most
of the
fine
detail shown
at A, but
if
a
smaller
rendered
drawing
of
the same
cornice were
to be made
it
would
probably
prove
necessary
to
further
simplify the subject.
This one
illustration
i
doubtless
sufficient to
show that the draftsman must work for a wholly
different
result
in
a sketch from
that
required
in an
elevation, forgetting or merely suggesting
many
of
the
tiny
members,
in
obtaining
the
broad
effect.
As
a
further example we might
add that in drawing a window he must not allow
his knowledge of the blind-stop, the pulley-style
and
the parting-strip
to
interfere with the sim-
plicity of the result
;
in fact whatever the detail
may
be,
the same
care should be taken
not
to
overemphasize
relatively
unimportant
portions
of
the subject.
Let us return for a moment to our discussion
of cornices,
for they contribute so much
to the
effect
of
a building that extreme
care must
al-
ways be used
in
their
representation.
First
of
all do not overdarken
the
projecting
portions,
for
it
is the contrast of the light corona against
the shadow
below
which
gives
the
desired
sense
of projection. We might also speak again of the
advantage which may sometimes be
gained by
using a graded shadow below
a
cornice, allow-
ing the tone to gradually darken towards the bottom,
thus giving transparency at the top and a clean-cut
contrast
at the lower edge.
(See Chapter VI and
illustration 4 at the top of Figure 28.)
Remember,
too. that the cornice shadow is usually made darkest
at the corner of the building nearest the
spectator,
lightening
gradually
as
the
walls
recede,
thus
adding to the effect of distance.
There
is some-
times a question as
to how much
detail should be
shown
in
a
cornice shadow, and the answer to
this
is not easy, for
all depends on the size and
purpose of the drawing.
If
it
is large and made
as
a means
of
studying
the
proportions
and
de-
tail
it may prove necessary
to draw every
modil-
lion and
dentil, but
if
it
is
small
or made simply
to
give
the
general
effect,
the
less
important
parts
can
be
omitted.
Sometimes
mutules or
brackets or rafter ends or any
details with con-
siderable projection
are
left white or nearly
so,
for
if
the
sketch
is
small
and
such
parts
are
drawn
in
their true values they may be
lost
in
the darkness of the shadow.
This point
is
illus-
trated by Sketch
1, Figure 33,
in which the
rafter
ends are shown lighter than they would probably
be
in
the
executed
work.
In
some
drawings
such
details
are made
quite
distinct
in
a few
places,
especially
in
those parts
of the building
nearest
the
eye, and
then made
less
definite or
omitted
in
others.
If well done
this treatment
gives an
excellent
impression
with
a minimum
expenditure
of time and
effort.
Of the various ways of building up a shadow
there
are
three which
are
in general
use.
The
first
is
illustrated
at "B,"
Figure
33.
where
the
lines composing the shadow
are
so merged
to-
gether as to make
it
difficult to
tell their direc-
tion,
in fact in a shadow where the lines them-
selves
are
so
indefinite
this
direction
is
unim-
portant and the tone may be formed in the most
convenient way.
In
the
second
method,
illus-
trated
at
"1"
and
"2,"
Figure
33,
the
shadow
value
is
"built up" by
a succession
of adjacent
strokes,
either
touching
or
nearly
so,
the
strokes
being often drawn
in
a vertical
position, as our
illustrations
show,
but
sometimes
taking
the
same
general
slope
as
the
rays
of
light which
cause
the
shadow.
This method
is
frequently
employed
when
the
sketch
is
made
at
small
scale.
If a drawing
is of such a size or character
as
to demand much
detail, however, a
still
dif-
ferent method
is popular.
In place of the mass
shading
of
the
first and
the
parallel
strokes of
the
second,
the
lines
run
in
the
direction
or
directions which
best suggest the bricks or the
clapboards or whatever the materials
in shadow
may
be.
Sketches "3," "5" and "6"
illustrate
this
third method and
it
is not
difficult to
tell, even by
the
shadow
tone,
which
sketch
represents
brick,
which one stone, and which shingle.
In using this
method the student must be careful not to get too
"spotty" a character to the value for
it
is
essential
to preserve
a
restful breadth of
effect throughout
the tone.
We should not leave the subject of cornices with-
out some reference to
reflected
light and
reversed
shadows.
It
is frequently the case that bright light
is
reflected
from some
brilliant
object
into
dark
tones
such
as those beneath
a
cornice.
This
not
only means that the shadow value
itself
is neutral-
ized and
so made
lighter, but
a
reflection of
this
sort
is
often
the cause,
also,
of what
are termed
"reversed shadows," which really are shadows with-
in a shadow, caused by modillions or any such pro-
jections
which
prevent
the
reflected
light
from
penetrating
some
of
the
deeper
corners.
These

122
SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
reversed shadows are of
especial value
in
render-
ing elevations
in wash such as that shown on page
134.
In
this
sort
of
drawing where
the shadows
are
cast
in
the
conventional
45-degree
method,
Ihe reversed tones are usually
reflected
in
just the
opposite
way,
as
is
the
case
in
the
rendering
to
which we
have
just
referred.
(Note
particularly
the
reversed shadows
cast by the
dentils.)
In
na-
ture,
however,
the
location
and
the
form
of
the
reversed shadows will of course depend on the
di-
rection of the rays of reflected light, and this direc-
tion may
vary
from hour
to hour
as
the
sun
or
other source of direct illumination changes
in posi-
tion.
So
far
as
cornices
are
concerned,
however,
it
is true
that
reflected
light often causes the
soffit
to appear
quite
brilliant,
so
in many drawings the
soffit value
is represented no darker than
in Sketch
"5." Figure
33, and
in
tiny drawings such
horizon-
tal planes as
this are sometimes left actually white.
Though we have so
far spoken of
reflected
light
mainly
as
it
influences cornice tones,
it
should not
he supposed
that
it has no
effect on
other values,
for
it
has, though
as
a
rule
the horizontal
planes
seem to catch more such light than do the
vertical.
A window
soffit,
for
instance,
is
often
quite
bril-
liant
as
is
the
intrados
of an
arch,
while even
as
large
a
surface
as
a porch
ceiling
is
often
visibly
brightened.
Before
we
drop
our
discussion
of
Figure
33,
attention
is called to the variety of methods of sug-
gesting
roof
shingles which
it
shows.
Too much
care cannot be given
to such representations,
for
in
a drawing of the average residence so large an area
is taken up by the roof planes that unless they are
well handled
the
effect
of
the whole drawing may
be
ruined.
First
of
all
the values of
the
different
parts
of
the
roof must
be
decided
upon,
as some
portions
can
perhaps
be
left
white
or
nearly
so
while
others
will
appear
quite
dark.
Next,
the
me'hod
of
indicating
the
roof
material
must
be
chosen, and
it
is here
that
the
sketches on
Figure
33 may prove useful, or.
if the roof
is of some other
material,
Figure
34
offers
some
suggestions.
Sketch "A" on
the
latter
plate represents
shingles,
flat tiles or slate
Sketch "B" indicates a rough tex-
tured slate in graduated courses
Sketch "C" shows
shingle
thatch, "D"
straw
thatch,
"F."
suggests
tile, while "F" again shows
slate, though
a
similar
indication
would
answer
for
shingle.
It may
be
well
to mention here that good pen renderings are
sometimes
of
great
assistance when
drawing roof
or wall
surfaces
as they offer much
in
the way
of
material
indication which
can
be
adapted
to
pencil
rendering.
There are several
faults frequently found
in rep-
resentations of rrof
surfaces, concerning which the
student should be warned.
First of
all,
if a draw-
ing
is small
in
scale one should seldom attempt
to
show every course of
slate or shingles, for if this
is
done the value
is almost sure to become
either too
complex or too dark.
It
is better to space the lines
separating the courses somewhat further apart than
they
would
be
in
the
actual
building.
In
larger
drawings
this
criticism
does
not
hold
unless
the
roof
pitch
is very low
or the
roof
planes
greatly
foreshortened, in which case a small number of lines
may
prove
sufficient
to
suggest
many
courses.
When graduated courses
of
slate are shown
as
at
"B" Figure
34, decreasing
in
size from the bottom
to the top, an unpleasant
effect of curvature of the
roof
sometimes
appears.
Such
an
effect,
if
con-
spicuous,
can
usually
be overcome by throwing
a
shadow
bounded
by
approximately
straight
lines
onto
the roof, as from a tree or some neighboring
building.
In
fact, the addition of any straight lines
following the pitch of the roof
will help to correct
such
distortion.
Whatever
material
is
used
as
a
roof covering, avoid breaking the tone into too many
conspicuous spots, for one of the most common de-
fects of the drawings of beginners
is the spottiness
of surfaces which in actual buildings would be either
"flat" throughout
or gradually graded.
Just as roofs deserve careful
attention, wall sur-
faces also need
to be represented with the greatest
care.
Here
ag; in
it
is seldom
advisable
to
try
to
show every brick course or each stone but the mate-
rials should be so indicated as to leave no doubt as
to
their nature.
Figures
33,
34, 35 and 36 all give
suggestions
for the treatment of such
surfaces, the
larger drawings on Figure 35 being of sufficient size
to show the
detail very
clearly.

1 Representation
There
is no great
diffi-
culty in acquiring the
skill
to render a wall of brick
or
stone, or a roof of
slate or
shingle, but when
it
comes to successfully representing windows or glazed
doors or any objects containing large areas of glass,
cur task proves less simple,
for glazed surfaces are
so complex and changeable
in
their appearance as
to demand
special care and
skill
in their indication.
It
is not hard, to be sure, to learn to draw a typical
window or two,
especially
if shown
at small
scale,
but
if the scale
is so large as to make any consider-
able amount
of
detail necessary
it
is no easy task
for
the beginner to do even
this much
well,
while
it
is
still more
difficult
to
so render a number of
adjacent windows as to give them the best effect
in
relation
to one another and to the remainder of the
building.
If
they
are made
too dark
or too
light
they may, even though good
in themselves,
attract
more than
their proper
share
of
attention, and
if
all are drawn
in the same way the result
will prob-
ably prove monotonous, while
if,
instead, too much
variety
is shown, the breadth of
effect of the whole
drawing
is
almost
sure
to
be
destroyed.
Before
attempting finished renderings of windows the
stu-
dent
should,
therefore,
acquaint
himself
through
observation and study with the appearance of glass
under
different
circumstances
and
conditions,
for
it
is only by
so doing that he can
represent
it
to
the
best
advantage
in any
given
problem.
Walk-
along a street and study the windows that you
see,
not only those near at hand but those
in the dis-
tance
as
well.
Compare
those on
the sunny
side
with
those
in
the
shade,
and
those
in
the
upper
stories with those in the lower.
As you make these
comparisons
ask
yourself
such
questions
as
the
following:
What
is
the
difference
in the
appear-
ance of
glass
in
sunlight and
in shade?
Do win-
dows
in
the upper
stories have
the same
general
effect as those in the lower?
How do windows
in
the
distance
compare
with
those
near
at hand?
Can
you
see
the
curtains
or
shades
distinctly

all
the windows?
How much
of
the
interiors of
the rooms do you
see
as you pass?
Is
the
glass
always
plainly visible?
Is
it hard
to
tell
if panes
have been broken from a sash?
Is
it easy to
dis-
tinguish plate glass when you see
it?
If
so, why?
Do
all
the
lights of glass
in one window look the
same?
Does
the
glass
usually
seem
lighter
or
darker
than
the
sash
itself?
Do you
see
images
reflected
in
the glass?
If
so, are they
sufficiently
definite to permit you to
tell trees from buildings?
Does your own image appear in the windows? Are
images more distinct in glass in shade than
in glass
in the sunlight?
Are reflections as clear on a rainy
day as they are when the sun
is shining?
A
little
observation
will answer
such
questions
as these and make
it evident that ordinary window
glass
has two
leading
characteristics
which
relate
especially
to
its appearance, and which
are,
there-
fore,
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
student.
First comes
its
transparency.
Under
certain
con-
ditions
glass
seems
practically
invisible.
This
is
especially true of clean plate glass favorably lighted.
We are sometimes
able, then,
in our representation
of windows,
to
neglect
the
glazing and
treat
the
sashes just as though the panes were non-existent,
showing distinctly the shades and hangings
within,
or,
if the drawing
is made from an
interior,
look-
ing
out,
the
foliage and
sky
beyond.
The
other
characteristic, and
the one which
causes much
of
the trouble of the beginner,
is the power that glass
has
to
act
as
a
reflector
or
mirror,
giving,
very
often,
a
shiny
effect
to
the window,
and
usually
images of objects as
well, which
in some cases are
almost
as
clear
as
those
obtained
in
the
usual
"looking
glass."
One
of
the
difficulties
confront-
ing
the
student who
tries
sketching
directly from
buildings
is the
complication
in
the
effect of glass
resulting from these
reflections, for often trees and
buildings and
skies and
clouds and
people
are
all
pictured
in
the windows, showing so
plainly
as
to
prove confusing, for the images are not only some-
what distorted,
as a
rule, because of imperfections
in
the
glass, but are crisscrossed by the sash bars
and
mingled
and
blended
with
the
curtains
in
a
most bewildering manner.
It
is not easy, therefore,
to know just what to put in and what to leave out.
so considerable experience will be necessary to teach
what really
is essential and what should be subordi-
nated or omitted.
It
is worth remembering that as
a
rule
the two
characteristics
of
glass
which we
have mentioned appear
in combination
;
the
glass
seems
sufficiently
transparent
to
enable
us
to
see
through
it quite easily yet has enough
reflection
to
give
it
a
shiny
appearance.
Sometimes,
however,
this power to
reflect neutralizes the
effect of trans-
parency to such an extent that we find
it impossible
to look through the panes at
all.
This
is especially
true
in windows near the top
of a building where
the reflection of sunlight or bright sky
is frequently
so strong as to make the curtains within either in-
visible
or
very
indistinct.
Such
windows,
and
particularly those of the upper stories of very
tall
buildings,
often take on much the same color and
tone as the
sky, and
if
the sun
itself
is
reflected,
the
windows
become
dazzling
in
their
brilliancy.
A reflected
light cloud may make the glass almost
white, while a blue sky may cause a blue reflection
of a value similar to that of the sky
itself.
If we
observe the windows nearer the street level we find
as a
rule
that most
of them seem
darker,
for
in
place of the sky reflections we have those of nearby
buildings and
trees.
It
is useful to bear in mind,
then,
that when
rendering
tall
buildings
the
gen-
eral tone of the glass, taken as a whole, may often
be correctly shown lighter
in the upper than
in the
lower
stories.
Even
in
the
ordinary
suburban
home or country house the windows
of
the lower
floors
frequently seem
darker when viewed
from
without than do those above, especially if the nearby
foliage
is comparatively low,
so as to
reflect
in the
downstairs windows only.
It
is true, too, that glass
within shadow,
or on
the
shady
side
of
a
build-
ing, usually seems much lighter than we would ex-
pect,
so
it
is by no means
necessary
to
represent
it by a dark tone simply because
it
is within shade
or shadow.
Its
light appearance
is
generally due
to
the
fact
that
it
mirrors
the
brightness
of
the
sky
or
some
nearby
building
in
sunlight.
This
power which glass has
to
reflect varies under
dif-
ferent circumstances.
If
glass has black or dark-
ness as a background, or
is
in shadow as we have
just mentioned,
it usually proves a stronger
reflec-
tor than
it does when in light or with light shining
through from
behind, or with
a
light background.
Paint glass black on the back and
it becomes a good
mirror,
reflecting
objects
very
distinctly.
When
we look at a window from without,
in the daytime,
and
it has no shades or curtains,
its glazing may be
likened
to
the
painted
glass
just
mentioned,
the
darkness of the interior being relatively of a deeper
value than
the outdoor tones and therefore taking
the
place
of
the
black
paint, and
such
a window
shows
reflections
more
distinctly
than
one
with
light
curtains
behind.
If
a
window
by
chance
shows portions of a black, or any very dark window
shade and
of
a
light
one
as
well,
the
reflections
will
be more
distinct on
that portion
of
the
glass
which has the dark shade behind
it, and contrarily
if a similar window has a light shade lowered to the
sill
so
as
to
fill
the whole opening
the
reflections
will
be
comparatively
indistinct.
As
a
further
proof that glass
is a good mirror when backed up
with black, stand facing a window in a lighted room
at
night,
with
the
shade
raised, and
if
it
is dark
out-of-doors your own
image
can
be
easily
seen.
In the daytime, however,
if you stand
in the same
place and look out
into the
sunlight you
will
find
your
reflection
to be quite
indistinct or even
invis-
ible.
When making a
drawing
of an
interior
as
it
appears
in
the
daytime
it
is,
therefore,
seldom
necessary to show any reflections in the glass of the
windows
or
doors
of
the
outside
walls,
as
the
brighter
light
without
renders them
impotent.
In
fact
in architectural drawing
it
is only occasionally
that
definite
reflections
of
objects
are
shown,
for
unless extreme
care
is used
to
keep them
incon-
spicuous they may become so noticeable as to
seri-
ously detract from the
result.
It
is not often ad-
visable, for instance, to show the reflections of tree
trunks or nearby buildings, and
if such images are
indicated they should be drawn correctly and kept
subordinated.
There
are
times,
however, when a

126
SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
reflection
of
a window
reveal or an arch intrados
or some
similar
adjacent
part
of
a
building may
prove
interesting, and
in the sketch at "5," Figure
36,
a
dark
reflection
of
the
shaded
intrados
is
shown.
Even
though
comparatively
little
use
is
made of definite images of objects, when represent-
ing glass, the
effect of most windows
is, neverthe-
less, modified
to such an extent
in general tone by
the
indefinite
reflections
of
the
sky
and
distant
objects as to demand some expression of this modi-
fication, but as the spectator, when viewing a draw-
ing, seldom has an exact knowledge of what these
objects influencing the appearance may be, the artist
is
usually
at
liberty
to assume such
conditions
as
best
suit
his
requirements and
convenience.
This
means
that
if
it
pleases him
to draw
his windows
light,
on
the assumption
that they are
reflecting
a
bright
sky, or dark
for some
similar
reason, he
is
at
liberty
to do
so, and
as windows
often change
in
effect completely and suddenly,
it
is hard to dis-
pute his authority.
Now
to
get down
to
a
few
practical
facts
of
value to the beginner.
First of
all, decide whether
the
glass
is
to
be shown
light
or
dark.
This
de-
pends
largely on
the surrounding material.
If
the
walls are of light plaster, and strong contrast seems
desirable, keep the glass dark
;
if,
instead, the walls
are
of
dark
material,
light
windows
will
attract
more
attention.
There
are many
cases,
however,
where
it seems wise to keep certain windows incon-
spicuous,
as a matter
of
presentation,
and
under
such conditions
strong contrast
is
of
course
to
be
avoided.
The
best way
to
determine
which
win-
dows should be dark and which
light
is by making
a preliminary study on tracing paper before
start-
ing the
final
rendering.
As
a
rule those windows
nearest the spectator,
or,
in some instances, nearest
the
center
of
interest,
should
show,
not
only
the
sharpest
contrasts but
also the
greatest amount
of
detail.
This gives us an opportunity
to get
a
cer-
tain
variety of treatment
in the different windows,
which
is
essential, but
at
the same time care must
be taken not to provoke unrest by overemphasizing
the
differences
of
representation.
Once
a
general
scheme
for
the
values
has been
determined
upon,
it
is necessary to reach a decision
as
to how much
detail
is
to be shown through the
glass.
This
will
depend
largely on the location of the windows and
on the nature of the building.
If a dignified faqade
is
to be rendered,
it
is seldom wise to show much
inside
the
glazing,
as
curtains and
the
like
some-
times
detract
from
the
architectural
character
of
a
formal
building unless
rendered
in
a
very
con-
ventional
manner.
An
informal
building,
such
as
a
suburban
residence,
permits
greater
freedom
of
expression, however,
so
in
a
building of
this
sort
it
is usually
best
to show
the shades and
curtains
quite distinctly.
Stiffness of effect
is avoided
if an
occasional window
is shown open, or with the shut-
ters
partly
closed,
while awnings and
screens and
such things sometimes add to the
feeling of
reality.
In
a
formal
building
if
shades
are shown
in
the
windows they are usually
all lowered
to
the same
point,
generally about
one-third
to
one-half
way
down from
the
top,
or are arranged
in some uni-
form manner, but greater variety of spacing
is per-
missible in less formal structures.
Inside draperies
harmonize
better with
the
structural
lines
of
the
building
if shown hanging
vertically
or
nearly
so,
and
for
this
reason
it
is
often
well
not
to
drape
them
in
curves,
as curved
lines
frequently
attract
too much
attention.
Neither
is
it necessary or de-
sirable to show much
detail or design in the hang-
ings, though
there
is no
1m rm
in
suggesting some
simple pattern, as
in
"4," Figure 36, especially
if a
sash
is unbroken by muntins or other objects. When
it
comes
to
the
rendering
of
the
sashes
and
the
window
frame,
treat
the woodwork very
broadly,
merely
suggesting by one
or two
lines
all
the
va-
rious members of which the whole
is composed. The
sash bars
will usually be
sufficiently
well
indicated
if
a
single
line,
representing
their
shady
side, and
their shadow on
the
glass
is
used.
Sashes are, as
a
rule,
left
white on
renderings,
but
there are
in-
stances where the glass
is shown so light as to cause
dark sashes to seem essential as a means of produc-
ing proper
contrast.
In
"5," Figure
36,
it
will IK
noticed
that the woodwork of the door
is left light
at the bottom where the glass
is dark, but graded to
dark
at the top so as
to count strongly against the
light
reflection.
In
"9,"
Figure
37,
the
sashes are
in
shadow
and
consequently
dark,
but
the
glass
here
is catching a strong
reflection
of
light,
as
in
the previous example.
It perhaps seems a
bit ex-
treme
to
leave
the
glass
as
white
as
it
is
in
this
sketch
and
in
the
doorway
at
"13"
on
the
same
sheet, but an
effect
of
transparency
is
obtained
in
this way, and
the
light tone of the glass pleasingly
breaks
up
the
monotony
of
the
shadow.
Often,
however, the glass
in such windows
is shown very
dark,
this being
a matter
of
choice, as both
condi-
tions are found
in actual
buildings.
In most drawings of windows
the shadows
cast
by
the frame and by the sashes on the shades and
curtains
are made
quite prominent, and
this
often
adds greatly to the effect, and
it
is well as a
rule to
emphasize the shadows of the shutters
also.
There
is another point worth considering and
this
is
thit
if
there
is
a
large dark shadow near the top of
-i
window
it
is
best
not
to have
a
similar dark tone
at
the bottom,
as such
duplication may
injure
the
result.
Figures 36 and 37 show a variety of suggestions
for
the
treatment
of
windows.
Figure
36
was
drawn at exactly the same scale as here reproduced,
but Figure 37 was reduced from
a
larger drawing
measuring 8
inches
by
11
inches.
These
sheets
seem to
call
for no
special comment
in addition
to
that
already
made
unless
attention
is
directed to
"6" and "12"
in
the
latter plate.
In "6"
it should
be noted that the open
sash
is shown transparent,
the shadow
cast by the
sash
itself on
the wall
lie-
hind
being
visible
in
its
entirety.
In
"12." how-
ever,
the sash appears as
a
reflector, the dark vine
behind being invisible just as though the glass were
opaque.
These
two
sketches
illustrate
the
two
characteristics
of
glass
already
described.
In Figure 39 are shown
several
interior
sketches
in which windows
are
featured.
These
drawings
explain themselves, though mention might be made
of
the
fact
that

glazed

the

the
sashes
and
frames usually appear dark in their relation to the
outdoor
light beyond.
Because of this strong con-
trast even
light woodwork
often
seems very dark
if seen in silhouette.
When
drawing
an
interior
it
is
not wrong
to
show
objects out
of doors providing they
are not
made
so prominent
as
to
take
too much
interest
from the
interior
itself.
Unless
such
objects
are
quite near the glass, however, they should be drawn
very simply and lightly.
Having
studied
the
illustrations
accompanying
this text, as well as other reproductions that you may
have
at hand, and having demonstrated
for your-
self the truth of some of the
facts mentioned here,
try some
studies of your own, attempting to get a
glassy effect to each window, and crispness of draw-
ing as well, remembering all the while that windows
are
too important to be
slighted
in
representation.
The drawing by
Schell
Lewis on
the
following
page
is an unusually
fine example of pencil render-
ing of
a portion
of a building drawn
in
elevation,
and shows that even without the aid of perspective
it
is
possible
to
obtain a very
truthful and
at
the
same time interesting effect.
In this type of draw-
ing a knowledge of shades and shadows
is particu-
larly desirable as the sense of
relief and projection
depends
largely upon
the
form and
value
of
the
shade
and
shadow
tones.
Notice
the
manner
in
which
the
feeling
of curvature
in
the goose necks
above the leader boxes has been obtained, and give
particular
attention
to
the handling
of
the
smaller
detail within the shadow of the cornice of the door-
way
itself.
The sketches by Albert Kahn on pages
131,
132
and 133 are excellent representations of an entirely
different
sort
of
detail,
for
these
are
measured
drawings made directly from examples of wrought
iron and carved wood in the South Kensington Mu-
seum.
Apparently a few of the main lines were laid
out to scale instrumentally on a smooth coated paper
and the rest of the work done free-hand.
Obviously
architectural students or draftsmen can profit greatly
by making such measured drawings as these, as they
offer not only a means of becoming acquainted with
and
preserving a record of the objects drawn,
but
train
one
also
for
the making
of. drawings
from
which original work
is to be executed.

Chapter IX.
INTERIORS AND FURNITURE
THOUGH
a large percentage of all perspectives
and
renderings made
for
architectural
pur-
poses show exteriors of buildings, the drafts-
man
is, nevertheless, sometimes called upon to make
drawings of
interiors, including such accessories
as
furniture and draperies, and, as interiors offer certain
problems not usually encountered
in exterior work,
special
practice and
study
are
necessary
to
insure
their
satisfactory
solution.
Then,
too,
there
are
some
draftsmen
and
designers,
particularly
those
employed by
decorators,
or
in
furniture
or
uphol-
stery houses, who devote the greater portion of their
time
to rendering
interior
subjects, and
these men.
even more than those doing the usual form of archi-
tectural
work,
need
a knowledge
of how
interiors
actually
appear
and
how
this
appearance can
be
best represented.
A
lengthy
discussion
of
this
interesting
subject
seems hardly necessary, for many of the suggestions
already
offered
in
previous chapters
relate
to
inte-
rior as well as
to exterior work, and, therefore,
as
some
special comments have
also been made which
refer
to
interiors
only,
it
is our
present
purpose
merely
to add a few
ideas,
bearing
especially
on
methods of
representing some of
the many objects
and
materials
which
do
not
appear
in
exteriors,
such as the furniture and draperies mentioned above.
Before doing so, however,
it
will perhaps be well
to
first
call
attention
to
a few
of
the
essential
differ-
ences
in
the appearance
of
interiors and
exteriors,
for a comparison of
these differences, and
of
their
effect on the manner of
indication should prove
of
value to the student.
First
of
all,
interiors
are
considered
by many
artists
to be more
difficult
to draw than
exteriors,
and
for a number of reasons.
To begin
with, the
actual mechanical process of laying out an
interior,
preparatory
to
the
work
in
rendering,
is
usually
more laborious than for an exterior.
Exteriors are.
to be
sure, often
far from
simple, but when doing
an
office building or a
hotel or some
structure of
similar
general
form,
the
mass
of
the
whole
is
seldom complicated,
so
it
is usually
easy, once the
main construction
lines are instrumentally laid
out,
to
project
the
various
measurements
of
the win-
dows and
the
like
along
the
wall
surfaces
to
the
desired
position.
Interiors, however, though
often
as simple
in mass, are only begun when the archi-
tectural
shell of
ceiling and
floor and
walls
(with
their accompanying
doors
and windows)
is com-
pleted,
for
there remain
such
details
as
furniture
and
lighting
fixtures,
and
these
require
consider-
able time, for
it
is, as a rule, rather a lengthy proc-
ess
to
accurately
obtain
all
of
the
different meas-
urements
in
perspective,
as many
of
these
objects
stand away from the walls, which adds to the
diffi-
culty
of
projection;
and
once
the
correct
placing
and general dimensions are obtained,
it
is frequently
the case that the objects themselves are so irregular
in
form
as
to
necessitate
considerable
labor,
for
often many curved or slanted lines are required
;
in
fact,
such
pieces
as
rocking
chairs
sometimes
consist entirely of curved lines and
lines sloping at
various angles.
Then,
too,
it
is not uncommon to
find
furniture
so
turned
that
nearly
every
piece
requires vanishing points of
its own.
It
is,
there-
fore,
mainly
because
of
such
accessories
that
the
mechanical
layout
of
the
typical
interior
proves
laborious
to make,
though
there
are
certain
types
of buildings where the block form
itself
is
difficult.
One
of
the
hardest
kinds
of
interiors
to
draw
accurately
is
the
theatre,
where
the bowled
floor,
the
disposition
of
the
seats
in
curved
rows
with
radiating
aisles, the rounded and sloping balconies,
the
tiers
of
boxes,
the
proscenium
arch
and
the
vaulted or domed
ceiling,
all
offer labor enough to
tax the patience of
the most persevering.
In
addition
to
this
difficulty
of
instrumental
construction,
the
draftsman
of
interiors
is
some-
limes handicapped a bit by his inability to introduce
accessories just where he wishes
to have them
for
the purpose of obtaining the best composition.
In
drawing
exteriors
the
artist
can
often
make
an
otherwise
ordinary
composition
interesting by
ar-
ranging
his
trees and
vines and
clouds and
auto-
mobiles,
in
fact,
all such accessories,
about where
he wishes, and many of these can be made, also, of
almost
any
desirable
size
and
shape.
Interiors
sometimes permit the use of potted plants and vases
of leaves or flowers to serve a like purpose, and of
course
in conservatories we
find much of
this
sort
of thing, but on the whole there
is
less opportunity
for such freedom of arrangement, though the
fur-
niture and pictures and hangings do offer a similar
means of relieving the bareness of the architectural
background,
so that
this
of course
offsets
to some
extent the handicap
just mentioned.
Another
difference
in
appearance between
inte-
riors and exteriors is found in the effect of the light
and shade,
for
in exteriors the sun usually affords
a
single
direct means
of
illumination,
so
that
the
shadows can be laid out by an accurate mechanical
method,
if one knows the science of doing
so, and
the division between the
light and the dark
is gen-
erally
clearly
marked.
Interiors,
however,
are
usually far more complex
in their lighting, the rays
of
light coming
frequently
from
several
sources,
thereby
causing
complicated
values,
the
shadows
often
falling
in a number of directions at the same
time, and
the
tones of
these
various shadows

SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
faring
greatly, some
being
light and
others
dark,
with certain edges sharply defined and with others
indistinct. A chair leg, for example, often casts sev-
eral shadows on the floor at once and a lighting fix-
ture as many more on the wall or ceiling. This com-
plication
is
further
augmented
by
the
numerous
reflections, concerning which we
will
say more
in
a moment,
but notwithstanding
all
this,
the mere
fact
that
such
a
complex
condition
does
exist,
though
often very confusing to
the beginner,
fre-
quently works to the advantage of
the more expe-
rienced man, for, as we are accustomed to this com-
plexity of tone, the
skilled
artist
is able to arrange
his
values
almost
as
he
chooses and we
are
un-
aware that any liberties have been taken so long as
the natural effect has not been sacrificed.
As a
rule
it
is best for the beginner not to draw
;very
little
change
of
tone
that
is
seen,
but
he
should, instead, simplify the whole, working for the
general
effect
in a broad,
direct manner,
for when
one
enters
a room he
is
not conscious
of
all
this
detail,
therefore
it
should
not
be
forced
on
the
attention
in
the
drawing.
There
is
another
point
worth remembering and
this
is
that because much
of
the
illumination
of
interiors
is
indirect and the
light
rays
therefore
diffused,
the
general
effect
is
usually
softer than
is
the
case where we have an
exterior
in
direct
light,
the
tones
blending
or
merging into one another and
the division between
the light and shade being less clearly defined.
This
indefinite
effect, though
often
desirable
in
certain
types of drawing, can be easily carried to extremes,
and the
artist who strives
for
it sometimes obtains
a
result which, even though satisfying in one sense,
may be
displeasing
in
another,
for such
a
render-
ing
is
often
so gray and
lacking
in contrast
as
to
prove
hardly
suitable
for
architectural
purposes,
where a drawing with
clean-cut
edges
and
sharp
definition
of tone
is preferred
as
a
rule
to
a
soft
and vague interpretation.
The
artist who
is work-
ing for a crisp
result will find a certain
fact
to his
advantage, and
this
is
that many objects found
in
interiors,
being
well
polished
and
smooth,
offer
strong
reflections
and
highlights
which,
if
judi-
ciously used, serve as a pleasing break
in the gray-
ness of the general effect.
Out-of-doors we seldom
find such
shiny surfaces as we do
inside, with
the
exception of a few like those of smooth water and
glass.
The
building
materials
used
outside
are
usually
rather
dull
in
finish, and even
if
polished
when
first put in place soon lose their gloss because
of
the
action
of
the weather.
Materials found
in
interiors, on the other hand, often
exhibit the con-
trary characteristics.
Floors are of highly polished
wood or marble
;
the trim
is
frequently
varnished
or
given
some
enamel
finish,
and
glazed
tiles
or
similar
objects are
sometimes
introduced,
particu-
larly
around
mantels,
but
it
is
especially
in
the
furniture and
in
such
accessories
as
the
lighting
fixtures, vases,
etc.,
that we find many surfaces of
high reflective value.
Table tops, for example,
fre-
quently
act almost
like mirrors, while
the
glass
in
the framed
pictures on the walls has
similar char-
acteristics.
Chair arms, door knobs, clocks,
dishes,
etc.,
all add
little highlights, often of extreme
bril-
liancy in
relation
to the surroundings, and the
stu-
dent
is
wise who
learns
to employ
these
sharply
contrasting
accents
to give
life
to
his work,
espe-
cially in drawings of an architectural nature. Many
otherwise
"dead"
drawings
receive
most
of
their
character from just such accents as these.
So much of a general nature by way of compar-
ing exteriors and
interiors.
The main points to be
remembered are that interiors are usually more dif-
ficult to lay
out,
that
it
is
not, as a
rule, so easy
to arrange the accessories to assist the composition,
that
the
values
are
more
complex,
with
the
shadows made difficult because of light from various
sources, and,
last
of
all,
that
the general
effect
is
sometimes rather vague and soft, but that highlightL
and accents are
frequently
to be found on the pol-
ished
surfaces,
which,
if
properly
interpreted
by
the
artist,
will
give
a
clean-cut
character
to
his
work.
Now,
as we proceed to our
discussion
of meth-
ods
of
representing
various
objects and
materials
common
to
interiors,
it
is
necessary
to
repeat the
statement which we have
already made
a number
of times, and this
is that few definite rules exist to
tell us how
to do such work.
Each
student must
learn to see and to interpret the things that he sees
in
his own
way,
and
books
and
instructors
can
merely offer a few suggestions by way of assistance.
Learning
to draw
is,
in
fact,
so much a matter of
learning to
see, that
it
is impossible to overempha-
size
the
importance
of
cultivating
the
ability
to
observe
things
intelligently.
In
order
to
draw
draperies,
for example,
or upholstery
materials,
it
is
necessary
to
first
of
all
carefully
observe
the
various fabrics employed
for such purposes, study-
ing each one with
care, looking at
it close at hand
and
in the distance,
in bright and
in subdued
light,
laid
out
smoothly
and
draped
in
folds,
searching
always
for
its special characteristics under
all such
conditions,
and
endeavoring
also
to
retain
mental
impressions
of
these
peculiarities
for
future
use.
Then
compare
one
fabric
with
another,
or
drape
several
in such a way that they can be
easily seen
at one
time.
It
is
surprising what
differences can
be discovered by an inspection and analysis of
this
sort.
A piece of
satin and a piece of cotton cloth
of
similar
color and
tone
will
vary
greatly
in
appearance, and
even
a
light
piece
of
cotton and
a dark piece of the same material will show marked
dissimilarity
of
effect
in
addition
to
the
contrast
in
color.
It
is
impossible
to
describe
such
differ-
ences
in
a
single
chapter,
but
there
are
one
or
two
suggestions worth
offering
:
first
of
all,
light
colored
cloth
usually
shows more
contrast
in
its
values than does darker material of a similar kind,
as
the dark
color seems
to
absorb
many
of
the
lighter
values
of
shade and
shadow.
A
smooth
material with a sheen will not look at
all like some
dull
fabric
of
similar
tone,
as
it
will
have many
highlights and
reflections, and
certain
fabrics such
as
velours
will
sometimes
appear
dark
where we
expect them to be light, and light where other mate-
rials would
be
dark, ?nd by
nibbing
the nap
the
effect can be changed from
light
to dark or from
dark to
light instantly.
Many materials of a shiny
nature grow
dull and
soft with
age, but there are
exceptions,
for some
others,
leather,
for example,

often become smooth and glossy with wear.
The
smoother
the
material,
the more
complicated and
changeable are its values, as a rule, and the stronger
its highlights.
Now when
it comes to draping fab-
rics
there
is
great
variety
in
the way they
hang,
for some
are
stiff and
inflexible
and
others
soft
and
yielding.
Heavy
materials
usually hang
quite
straight and show
fewer
small
folds
and
creases
than do
those which
are
light
in
weight.
Heavy
materials,
too,
are
generally
opaque
and
for
this
reason
are
sometimes
less
difficult
to
represent
than
are
thin
nets and
scrims and
similar
fabrics
which are so translucent or even transparent as
to
show
light,
or
occasionally
objects,
through
them.
As soon as the student has carefully studied the
appearance
of
all
these
things
he
is
ready
to
attempt some drawings,
giving
special attention
to
the representation of surfaces and textures. Where-
as there
is no harm
in sketching one
single
object,
like
an
upholstered
chair,
it
is
often
of
greater
benefit
to
arrange
compositions
of
several
objects
which
are
associated
by
use, and
which
offer,
in
addition,
a
variety
of
surfaces.
Old
objects
such
as
'are found
in museums
are
especially good
for
practice of
this
sort as the textures of antiques are
more varied and interesting than are those of most
modern
pieces.
If
it
is not convenient
to do mu-
seum
work, however,
things
at home
will answer
very
well.
Arrange an easy chair and
a
table and
reading
lamp,
for
instance,
in
natural
position
to
form ^. pleasing group, adding, perhaps, a book or
magazine and
such
other
accessories
as
will make
the composition
complete.
Have
the
light coming
from one direction
if this
is practical, so as to avoid
complicated
shadows.
Then
in making the draw-
ing use the greatest care
in suggesting such
things
as
the
shine
of
the
table
top
and
the
floor,
the
numerous touches
of
highlight, and
the texture
of
the rug and the
table runner and the lamp
shade.
Try,
as
in any composition,
to properly emphasize
the center
of
interest, and
give
especial
attention,
also,
to
the
treatment
of
the
edges
separating the
light from the shade, having them clean-cut where
they appear so
in the objects and
indefinite where
such an
effect seems
called
for.
If a
trial proves
that
it
is too difficult to draw directly from objects,
or
if
it
is hard to secure
suitable
ones, work from
photographs,
instead,
selecting
those
which
show
the detail quite clearly and have
little
effect of per-
spective
distortion.
It
is
sometimes advantageous
to choose pictures of period
furniture and
furnish-
ings for this work, for by so doing valuable knowl-
edge of the periods rmy be obtained in addition to
the drawing practice.
Figures
38,
39 and
40, accompanying
this
text,
require
little
explanation.
Figure
38
is
shown
mainly
for
the
suggestions
that
it
offers
for
the
treatment of such textures as we
find in the brick-
work,
the rough
plaster,
the hewn beams and the
polished
floor.
It might
be
well
to mention
that
when drawing such a
surface
as
a
shiny
floor
or
table top
it
is well to show some lines representing
the
reflections of
objects, and
others, often
in
the
opposite
direction,
indicating
the
surfaces
of
the
boards
themselves.
A
study
of
the
floor shown
here
will
reveal
both
these
sets
of
lines
and
for
additional examples see the top of the dressing table
and
the
chair arms and
the
floors
in
Figure
40.
Figure 40, by the way,
is a more conventional type
of
rendering
than
Figure
38,
for
here
the
back-
ground
is
simply
suggested,
_all
of
the
attention
being focused on the furniture
itself.
Such draw-
ings
as
these
are
often
used by
furniture
houses
and
for
advertising work.
Observe
that
in
these
particular examples comparatively little tone
is used,
the
white
of
the paper
counting
quite
strongly.
Figure
41
is
also
a
conventional
rendering,
the
drapery
itself
receiving
all
of
the
attention,
the
architecture being merely
suggested by the
fewest
possible lines, and here again much of the paper re-
mains untouched.
One advantage
of
this
type
of
rendering
is that after the student has had a reason-
able amount of practice
it can be done very quickly.
The supplementary
illustrations on the
following
pages
should
prove
of
great
interest and
value
as
they are excellent examples of widely different types
of work.
Those by Otto R. Eggers on pages
142
and 143 were made to show the client how the rooms
of his house, as designed, could be made to
look,
how
the
comparatively
low
ceiling and
the
simple
window
treatment
would
produce
a
dignified
and
home-like
effect
if
the rooms were
furnished
in
a
suitable
manner.
These
interiors
were
sketched
lightly in pencil without being laid out instrumentally.
The washes of water-color were then applied roughly
and when dry
the
sketches
were
completed
with
lithographic
pencil,
this
procedure
being
necessary
as water-color cannot
be
successfully
flowed
over
lithographic pencil lines.
The drawing by Mr. Pauli
on page 144 shows an entirely different handling, the
whole being carefully blocked out instrumentally and
finished
free-hand
in pencil with
infinite care, some
of
the
instrumental
lines
being allowed
to
remain.
Such drawings as this are often used
for catalogue
purposes
where
furniture
or
lighting
fixtures
or
things of that sort are advertised.
The ceiling draw-
ing on page 145 also combines free-hand and instru-
mental work,
being a
typical
vaulting development
such as
is
frequently employed by
interior decorat-
ors,
this
particular
study
being from
the
office
of
Theo. Hofstatter & Co.
From the same office
is the
drawing of the
side
table on page
146, which was
clone in pencil with washes of color added, this pres-
entation
effectively showing
the
piece
in
a way
to
give
the
decorator's
client
a
clear
idea
of
it.
Now compare these drawings with others
in order
to
learn
different
methods
of
obtaining
similar
effects,
and.
what
is
still more
important,
prac-
tice constantly.

Chapter X.
OUTDOOR SKETCHING
IN
THE
last few
chapters
special
attention has
been given to the representation
of minor por-
tions
of
both
exteriors and
interiors
of
build-
ings, and
it has been pointed out that these small de-
tails
really are
the
draftsman's A B C's, which he
should
learn
before
attempting
large
or
important
compositions.
His alphabet will not be complete, however, until
he
has added
to
his
knowledge
of how
to draw
these
elements
of
a
building
itself
a
fund
of
in-
formation concerning the indication of such acces-
sories
as
clouds,
water,
automobiles
and
other
vehicles, also animals, people and
foliage.
Foliage
is especially important as there are com-
paratively few drawings .of architecture which
fail
to show more or
less of
it, while
in many render-
ings
it occupies
a very large and prominent
place.
(We
use
a broad meaning
of
the word
here,
in-
cluding under the one
general
term
"foliage"
not
only masses of
leaves but
all such forms
of
plant
life as
trees, bushes, vines, grass and
flowers.)
It
is,
in
truth, almost as
essential
to be able
to draw
the natural
setting for a
building, as
it
is
to draw
the
building
itself,
and
the
student
should
con-
stantly bear this in mind
; neither should he lose sight
of
the
fact
that when sketching
foliage,
especially
trees, he
is
acquiring,
in
addition
to
a knowledge
of
drawing,
certain
principles
of
design
directly
applicable to architectural work, for there
is a very
definite analogy
in
several ways between trees and
buildings.
As an example of one such
similarity,
suppose we liken a tree to a
tall tower.
Just as the
tree
starts
at the ground with
a strong and sturdy
trunk, and gradually, as
it
rises
in height, becomes
more
complex
and
delicate
in
its
parts,
so,
the
tower, springing likewise from a solid base, becomes
lighter,
also, and
its smaller parts more numerous,
until,
finally,
as
it meets
the
sky
it
terminates
in
some crowning feature, graceful
in proportion and
fine
in
detail.
Nor should
it be
forgotten, when
studying
foliage,
that the student
is assimilating a
knowledge
of
plant form which may be
of
value
when
designing
or
drawing
ornament,
for much
architectural ornament
is either copied more or less
literally from nature or thoroughly conventionalized
like
the
lotus
of
the
Egyptians and
the
acanthus
and anthemion
of
the
Greeks.
Again,
aside
from
all esthetic considerations, the architectural student
should
not
overlook
the
fact
that he
can
acquire
from
the study of
trees much valuable knowledge
of various building and
finishing woods.
It
is because of these numerous advantages to be
gained from a study of trees and their
foliage, and
because
there
is,
too,
so much
pleasure
to be
de-
rived from such a pursuit and especially from the
outdoor sketching which
is so frequently a part of
it, that we are devoting an entire chapter to
its con-
sideration.
First
of
all,
before
discussing
actual means
of
representing foliage,
it may be well to point out that
its frequent employment in drawing
is natural, not
only because we are accustomed to see buildings in
an environment of green, but also because compo-
sitions which
are otherwise ordinary can be made
interesting by
its
use, even "bad"
architecture
be-
coming sometimes so improved
in
effect as to seem
attractive, if the surrounding planting is well designed
and rendered, while the beauty of "good" architec-
ture
is correspondingly enhanced by a proper setting.
Then, too, foliage can probably be put to the great-
est variety of uses of any of the accessories, and in
the most ways.
Trees,
for
instance, can be shown
of any kind and age, thus permitting a wide diver-
sity of shapes and
sizes.
Bushes and shrubs can be
drawn
in almost any
place and
of any
reasonable
proportion desired by the
artist, while vines can be
given an
equally
free treatment
without any
feel-
ing
of
their being
inappropriate
or
inharmonious.
Of course
in some instances
it becomes impossible
or undesirable
to
exercise such
complete
freedom,
for if a site for a building has already been selected,
having existing foliage worth retaining,
it
is usually
advisable
to show
with
considerable accuracy
that
part which
falls within the range of vision, but even
under these or similar conditions many liberties are
possible.
It
is within the
artist's province,
for ex-
ample, to decide whether the trees are to be shown
with or without
leaves.
Then
if he
feels
that an
improvement in the composition can be obtained by
slightly
shifting the
position
of
a
tree
or two,
or
by adding a few bushes or flowers, the privilege
is
his.
He can vary his
effect,
also, by
his choice of
the
values used
in
their
representation, employing
either light or dark tones as he wishes.
With these facts in mind, consider for a moment
the common methods of indicating people and
ani-
mals
and
automobiles
and
note
the
contrast
that
such
a comparison
shows,
for though
such
acces-
sories as these
last are undeniably important, espe-
cially
in renderings of
city
buildings,
it
is easy
to
see
that
the
artist
finds
greater
restrictions when
drawing them.
To begin with, they must be shown
with
considerable
accuracy
of
form
and
size.
Whereas
trees may vary a number of
feet
in any
dimension, or somewhat in contour, without attract-
ing attention
to such
variations,
let a
single
figure
be too large or small or poorly drawn, or an auto-
mobile out of
scale, and the
fact
is usually appar-

Some Methods
of Suggesting Foliage.

OUTDOOR SKETCHING

ent.
Foliage
is, therefore, often rather less
difficult
to
represent
than
are
these
other
accessories,
yet
mainly because
of
its
varied
uses
it
is
frequently
of
greater
value
to
the
student,
especially
as
a
means of obtaining satisfactory composition. Warn-
ing should be given, however,
that
in
architectural
renderings
one
should
never make
the
foliage
so
conspicuous
that
it
detracts from
the
architecture.
It
is not our intention to give the impression that
the
representation
of
foliage offers no problem, as
this
is not the case,
for to draw
it
well
is, indeed,
far
from
being
a
simple
matter,
in
fact,
many
draughtsmen who have
little trouble
in rendering a
building
find
foliage a stumbling block.
To draw
it well one should know
it
well.
Too often begin-
ners
try
to
sketch
from memory,
forming masses
of almost
meaningless
lines on
their
paper,
trust-
ing
to
chance
that
the
result
will
be
satisfactory.
Perhaps
it
will,
occasionally,
but
unless
one
has
drawn
a
great
deal
from nature
or
at
least from
good
photographs,
his memory
will
probably
play
him
false
or
lead him
into
the common
error
of
drawing
all
foliage
alike,
for
there are many men
who have acquired
the knack
of
indicating one or
two
typical
forms
fairly
well
and who
use them
over and over again regardless of conditions.
Such
repetition
of
course
produces
inexcusable
monot-
ony.
Whereas
it
is from such outdoor
sketching and
drawing from photographs
as we
have
just men-
tioned
that
one
is
able
to
acquire
most
easily
a
knowledge of
foliage representation,
it
is suggested
that as a valuable preliminary preparation
the
stu-
dent should study
his botany, and
read,
also, some
of the many excellent books devoted mainly to the
consideration of
trees.
(There are plenty such,
so
it seems unnecessary to call attention to any particu-
lar ones here, though
for a concise volume on the
subject,
F.
Schuyler
Mathews'
"Field
Book
of
American Trees and Shrubs"
is excellent, especially
from
the
draughtsman's
standpoint,
as
it
is
fully
illustrated with pen, crayon and color reproductions.
Then there are some written entirely from the art-
ist's
standpoint, among
which
Rex
Vicat
Cole's
"The
Artistic Anatomy
of
Trees"
is an
excellent
example,
for although
it
is an
English
publication
dealing
mainly
with
trees
native
to
England,
it
nevertheless
offers many
suggestions
applicable
to
the representation of our own
trees.) A perusal of
such volumes will not only familiarize one with the
names
and
leading
characteristics
of
the
more
common
varieties, and
train him
in
the laws
that
govern
their
growth,
but
should,
also,
strengthen
his love and appreciation of the beautiful
in nature.
It is by no means necessary to learn all the scientific
terms employed by the botanist or to memorize more
than a few of the essential
facts, but
it
is advantag-
eous to gain enough of a knowledge to enable one to
answer such questions as the following,
What are
"evergreen"
trees?
What
are
"deciduous"
trees?
Name some
characteristics
of
the
Pine
family;
of the Maple family
;
of the Birch
;
of the Beech.
Do Elms grow in Ohio?
Are Hemlocks found in
Kentucky?
Name
five
trees
that
are
tall
and
pointed.
Name five that are short and wide-spread-
ing-
Questions
like
these may seem
unrelated
to
pencil
sketching,
but they
really
are
not,
for
the
architectural delineator may be called upon to make
sketches for a building in Florida or Maine or Cal-
ifornia or in some part of the country which he has
never visited, using trees of an appropriate kind and
shape.
Unless he acquires such a knowledge, there-
fore, or knows where he can easily secure the infor-
mation when it is needed, he may make absurd errors.
It
is, of course, especially important for the artist
to be familiar with the
foliage
in his own
vicinity,
so as soon as he has gained a considerable amount
of
this "book"
lore he
is ready
to
visit a park or
the country, sketchbook
in hand, looking for actual
examples to illustrate the things which he has read.
Before
starting
to draw,
it
is
well
to take a walk
among the
trees, comparing one with
another,
ob-
serving
the
shape
of
the
general
mass
of
each,
analyzing, also,
its skeleton of trunk, limbs, branches
and twigs.
Search, meanwhile,
for a
suitable sub-
ject for the
first sketch.
This may be a whole tree,
or simply some portion of one, or perhaps a pleas-
ing group of
several.
In any
case the view-finder
will
be
of
help
in
selecting an
interesting compo-
sition.
At this point
it may be well to offer a few prac-
tical hints, and one
is that the best time of day
for
sketching
is usually the late afternoon, for the rays
of the sun are then so slanted as to produce an ex-
cellent
contrast
of
light
and
shade
and
shadow.
Needless to
say, however, there
is no time between
dawn and dark when one cannot sketch
to advan-
tage.
The
student
is
wise
to
sit
in
the
shade,
if
this
is possible, or at least to keep the sunlight from
falling directly on
his paper, for a bright glare will
not only prove trying to the eyes but may prevent
a correct judgment of the values,
especially
if one
is accustomed
to
spending
the
greater
portion
of
his time indoors.
In order to offset to some meas-
ure
the
brilliancy
of
the
outdoor
light, some
art-
ists use gray or straw-colored paper
for sketching
purposes,
which,
besides
having
less
tendency
to
cause
eye
strain,
also
permits
a
pleasing use
of
white pencil or chalk
for picking out some of the
high
lights.
More
will be
said
about
such
tinted
paper
in another chapter.
As to the
size of paper,
anything
will
do, some of
the pocket sketch-books
being
very
convenient.
The
objection
to
the
smaller ones
is that they prohibit freedom of move-
ment of the arm and wrist and thus
force one into
unnecessary
difficulties.
The
notebook
proportion
of
8
in.
by
10^2
in., which we have previously
recommended,
seems
practical,
and
some
artists
prefer
still
larger
sheets.
As the main object of
outdoor sketching
is to record
facts in a direct and
forceful manner, one should not use many grades
of
pencils,
for this
is no time
to worry over tech-
nique.
Have
several
pencils,
however,
of
each
selected grade
for they wear down
rather
quickly,
and be sure to carry a knife as they will need
fre-
quent
pointing.
Now
as
soon
as
the
subject .for
a
sketch
is
selected and the materials prepared, make yourself
as
comfortable
as
circumstances
permit,
in
order
to have your attention free for the task at hand.
In
this connection another suggestion may prove worth
mentioning and this is that a newspaper or magazine

in Conjunction with Architecture.

OUTDOOR SKETCHING

makes a
fairly comfortable
seat on the ground or
on some stone
or log or
wall,
if no
better one
is
available.
When
all
is
in
readiness,
proceed
with
your
sketch, blocking in the main proportions
lightly,
in-
dicating
also
the
lines
of
the trunk and
principal
branches.
Observation
will prove that the contour
of a tree is seldom as round as we sometimes imag-
ine,
in
fact the general mass of most
trees can be
bounded by an
outline made up
largely or wholly
of straight strokes.
When starting a sketch remem-
ber this truth.
Then, once this outline and the main
subdivisions have been
quite
definitely
established,
begin the
shading,
considering
carefully the
direc-
tion of the light, studying the subject through partly
closed
eyes
in order
to eliminate the
less
essential
values, remembering
the
impossibility
of
drawing
every
leaf and
twig.
Some
foliage
masses
seem
very
sharp
and
clean-cut
against
the
sky
while
others
soften
gradually
into
the
surroundings,
so
it
is necessary to choose the type of line best suited
to
the
conditions
at
hand.
This
choice
depends
partly on the individuality of the artist and the time
available
but
mainly
on
the
characteristics
of
the
foliage
itself.
The line which would nicely suggest
the leafage of the willow might
fail,
for
instance,
to
represent
the
individuality
of
the
pine.
The
sketches at "1" at the top of Figure 42 show a num-
ber of ways
of building up
foliage
tone,
while
at
"5"
sketches "B," "C," "D" and "E" show
differ-
ent methods
of
representing
similar masses.
This
variety of strokes should make
it
plain
to the
stu-
dent that there
is no set manner of working.
Con-
sequently
sketch
the
objects
before
you
in
what
seems the most natural way, and
if the
results are
not
satisfactory
try
again
using some
other
kind
of
strokes.
The
type
of
line employed
is
of
less
importance
than
are
the values
themselves,
for
if
these
are
carefully worked
out the
tree
will seem
properly modelled to give a sense of depth and pro-
jection.
Use care,
too,
in suggesting the roundness
of the branches and trunk, noting the great
differ-
ence
in
the
tone
of
the bark
in
sunshine and
in
shade.
The shadows
cast by the various branches
on one another
are worthy of
special
attention
as
are also those cast by each tree on the ground and
on surrounding
trees
or buildings,
in
fact,
so
far
as
architectural purposes are concerned,
it
is most
essential
to be
familiar with
tree shadows
as they
appear when
falling on the walls or roofs of build-
ings and on
the lawns and sidewalks.
Because
of
the
many
difficulties
encountered
when drawing entire trees
it
is often well to sketch
first
of
all
certain
portions
only,
making
studies
somewhat similar to "2," "3" and "5A," Figure 42.
After a number of these have been done
it
is time
to attempt
complete
single
trees
such as those on
Figure 43, adding a
bit of the surroundings
if you
choose.
Later try groups of two or more trees, as
indicated
at
"1,"
Figure
44.
This
sort of work
is
most
important,
but
neither
should
hedges
and
bushes and grass be neglected, so make some studies
similar to "2A," Figure 44, and even some of rocks
and ledges such
as those
at "2" and "5F," Figure
42, and
"2B,"
Figure
44,
for though
these cannot
be
classified under jhe term
"foliage" they can be
studied to advantage
at this time.
It
is not enough
to
sketch
nearby
trees,
but
those
in
the
distance
should be done as well, Sketch
3, Figure 44, show-
ing the simplicity which
is often found
in far away
foliage.
It is sometimes advisable to draw the same
tree from both near at hand and from the distance,
and
it
is
also
beneficial
to
sketch
it
at
different
seasons
of
the
year,
for
it
is
in
the
winter when
the
leaves
are
gone
that
the
best
opportunity
is
presented
for studying the
tree "skeleton."
If the
winter proves
too
cold
for outdoor
work
several
photographs might be taken
to be sketched
la*er,
the
first when the limbs are bare and others
in the
spring, showing the leafage at various
stages
in
its
development.
During
all of this study and sketch-
ing try to memorize the leading characteristics,
for
by so doing you
will
build
a
firm
foundation
for
future memory work.
It might be
well,
in closing,
to point out the
desirability of preserving
all such
sketches,
for no matter how incomplete or imper-
fect
they may
seem,
when
foliage
is
required
in
later renderings they will offer many suggestions of
great value, for the only real difference between the
work
from
nature and
that
done
in
architectural
renderings is that in the case of the latter the foliage
is made
rather inconspicuous and
is
also
in many
cases given a more conventional handling.
At
"4,"
Figure
44.
are shown
six "thumb
nail"
sketches of the same house done from the imagina-
tion,
each
with
a
distinctive
foliage
treatment.
These
show
only
a
few
of
numerous
possible
schemes which
could be devised by the student
to
meet
similar
conditions,
but
in
order
to
success-
fully develop any of them
at large
scale the kind
of
knowledge
gained
from
outdoor work
would
be of great help.
It
is suggested that the reader study
at
this time
the various drawings of trees which are found from
place
to
place
in
this
volume,
and
especially
the
masterly outdoor sketches by Mr. Hermann on pages
150, 154 and
155, which are excellent examples of
studies made directly from nature.

Chapter XL
ACCESSORIES
IN
LATER chapters we will consider the render-
ing of large buildings, the decorative handling of
architectural subjects, and the uses of tinted pa-
per, colored pencils, etc., but before doing so
it seems
advisable
in
this chapter and the next to round out
our discussion of architectural accessories by touch-
ing upon the representation of water,
skies,
clouds,
people and
vehicles,
repeating
for
the
purpose
of
emphasis a few of the suggestions already given and
adding such others as seem essential.
Needless
to say these accessories are of
sufficient
importance
to deserve a more exhaustive treatment
than
this, but the student who
is
interested
in
ob-
taining
additional
information
can
find many
spe-
cial
treatises devoted
entirely
to
these and
similar
subjects.
There
are
various
publications,
for
in-
stance, describing the different kinds of clouds, and
numerous books on
figure drawing and anatomy
;
the
recent book on
figure drawing by Mr. Bridge-
man, "The Human
Figure" by John
H.
Vander-
poel, "Figure Drawing and Composition" by R. G.
Hatton,
as
well
as volumes
on
composition
with
chapters on
the arrangement
of groups
of
figures.
The student
is advised to consult books of this sort,
and
it seems hardly necessary to add that the knowl-
edge
thus
acquired
should
be
supplemen'ed
by
sketching
nil
these
things
directly
from
nature
or
from
the
object,
taking
a
course
in
life drawing
(if
this
is
possible)
as
a means
of
acquiring
not
only an understanding of the human
figure but ex-
cellent
training
in drawing as
well.
Now
let us turn
to
a
brief consideration
of the
representation of water, and suppose we liken
it
in
appearance,
for
a moment,
to window
glass.
We have mentioned in a former chapter the com-
plicated
effect of glass, but
if that offers difficulties
to
the
student,
so
indeed
does
water,
in
fact,
the
latter
is even harder to draw
well,
for whereas the
former has
the two
important
characteristics
of
transparency
and power
to
reflect
images
of
ob-
jects, water not only has these but adds to them a
new
peculiarity
in
that
its
surface
is
constantly
changing
in
form,
being
smooth
one
moment,
rippled
the
next,
'and
disturbed
a
little
later,
per-
haps,
into large waves.
Smooth water often gives
as perfect a
reflection
as does a mirror,
yet under
slightly
altered conditions the images pre
distorter!
or destroyed
or the
surface becomes
like
a
trans-
parent pane of glass, the bed or bottom below being
plainly
visible.
Again such water sometimes seems
opacme and
lifeless, the surface alone being- visible.
Such appearances and
changes
are due
in part
to
three conditions:
First, the depth, color and purity
of
the water;
second,
the point from which
it
is
viewed, and
lastly,
the angle
at which the rays
of
light
reach
its
surface.
Deep, pure water,
for
in-
stance,
is usually,
if
still, an almost perfect mirror,
especially
if we
look along
it
rather than
straight
from above, but
in a shallow
or muddy stream or
pool
the
reflected
images
are
often
merged
or
blended with
the tone of
the water
itself and with
that
of
the bottom showing through,
distorted by
refraction.
If we look
directly down upon water
it seems
far more transparent, as a rule, than when
viewed
in
a more-nearly
horizontal
direction
and
this
is
true whether
it
is smooth
or rather
rough.
It
is
true,
too,
that when
the
light
rays
reach
the
surface
at some angles,
reflections which otherwise
exist wholly or partially
disappear,
and
the
effect
of
transparency
is
lost
also,
the
surface becoming
apparently opaque.
This refers to calm water.
Let
the
slightest breeze
ruffle the surface and the com-
plications
are
still
greater.
And
each
civ nge
in
the force or direction of the wind causes a
still dif-
ferent
effect.
These
things
all show
the
impossi-
bility of giving definite rules as to how water should
be
rendered
and make
it
plain
that
only
personal
observation
and
practice
will
bring any
real
pro-
ficiency in
its treatment.
There
are, however,
a few suggestions
that may
be of help to the studen\ one of which
is that the
greatest
care must
be
exercised
to have
the
lines
bounding any body
of water correctly drawn,
for
unless this
is done distortion may appear, the water
seeming
to
slope or bend
in an
unnatural
m-'nner.
It may be well to point out
that
in a large lake or
sea where the
farther shore
is
invisible because of
distance the horizon line for the water will coincide
with the eye
level for any
visible buildings.
Occa-
sionally, however,
this line
is "faked," up or down
a
bit,
if
a
better
composition
can
be
obtained
thereby.
In
smaller bodies the distant shore
lines,
unless viewed from
a very high
point,
also appear
practically
horizontal.
Once
the
outline
is
correct
it
is
well
to
block
in
whatever
definite
reflections
there may be, drawing them with the greatest care.
If the water
is smooth
the
reflection
of an object
will
appear very much
as
the
object
itself would
if suspended
in an inverted position.
If the water
is roueh the reflection will be more or less elongated
and
distorted,
for
the Waves
will
act
like
a
series
of
convex
and
concave
mirrors,
the
amount
of
elongation depending on the
size and shape of the
waves.
This
is illustrated
at "1," Figure 45, where
at A
the
reflection practically duplicates the
object,
while
at B
the waves
in the foreground show
bits
of reflection thus elongating the whole image.
Such
images are often
slightly
darker
than
the
object

reflected though the
re\*erse
is sometimes true, and
they are usually quite
definite near the object and
more and more broken and interrupted by contrast-
ing values as the distance from the object increases.
Another very important point
is that in represent-
ing a large body of water account should be taken
of
the
'fact
that nearby waves
appear
larger
than
those
in
the
distance;
consequently
larger
pencil
strokes are often employed in their indication.
Re-
member, too, that the distant shore
is usually rather
indistinct, therefore
it should be shown
so, with
'all
detail subordinated."^
The general tone of water
often depends on
its
reflective power.
If a sky
is light, for instance, the
water
will be quite
light
also,
as a
rule,
especially
if
smooth, and
vice
versa, though
there are many
exceptions
to
this.
So great
is the variety in the effect of water that
every
sort
of
line
is
needed
for
its
indication.
Vertical
strokes
are
often
satisfactory when
it
is
smooth,
whereas
those
of
a
generally
horizontal
direction are sometimes better when
it shows ripples
or waves.
The sketches in Figure 45
offer a num-
ber
of
suggestions
for
water,
using
different
strokes.
Perhaps the only one of these needing spe-
cial comment
is
that
at B
sketch
4,
showing
the
wet
streets.
This has been
presented because
de-
lineators
of
architectural
subjects sometimes show
wet
streets
and
sidew'alks
in
their
renderings,
mainly for the purpose of introducing a
little
inter-
est- and preventing
a hackneyed
result,
and
such
sketches
as
this
offer suggestions
for that kind of
work.
On
wet
sidewalks
and
streets
as
well
as
where water is of greater depth
it
is usually well to
combine with the
lines suggesting reflection,
others,
generally
opposite
in
direction,
indicating the
sur-
face
itself.
Before
leaving
this
subject
it may
be
well
to
mention' that shadows are often cast upon water by
various objects, the dark tone having a tendency to
cause the water
to appear
still darker
;
this
is sim-
ply another
of
the many
complications
that make
a thorough study of the whole matter
essential.
Now
let us give a few moments' thought
to the
indication of
skies and
clouds, which
are, perhaps,
as easy to handle in pencil as any of the accessories.
A few suggestions on essential points should prove
sufficient for
it
is by no means necessary to attempt
more than a simple sky treatment
in
the
average
architectural drawing.
It
is,
in
fact, often possible
to allow the white of the paper to remain untouched
or
to cover
it
with a uniform tone
of gray or to
grade
it in the simplest manner from dark above to
light
at
the
horizon.
The
value
selected
usually
depends on
the tone
of
the
building
illustrated
;
when
it' is dark in color or has a dark roof the sky
is
left
light,
but
if
light
it
is
sometimes
shown
against
a
dark
sky
in
order
to
secure
a
satisfy-
ing
contrast,
as
in
sketch
5,
Figure
46.
These
simple treatments are especially appropriate in ren-
derings
of
formal
buildings
where
many
clouds
might prove distracting.
Picturesque buildings per-
mit greater freedom, for^he accessories should have
a
character
similar
to
that
of
the
building,
but
even
these
informal
structures may
be
left
with
white paper
for the sky
if there
is
foliage and the
like to add
interest to the whole.
It
is perhaps
in
the
representation of
very
plain
buildings
with
a
rather
monotonous
setting
that
clouds
serve
the
best
purpose,- for even though
restrictions
prevent
the use of trees or other accessories, there
is seldom
an exterior drawing in which clouds cannot be em-
ployed
if one wishes, and nature gives us so many
kinds and arranges them in so many ways that there
is always opportunity
for an appropriate
selection.
A
building
of awkward proportion
or
displeasing
contour can be so disguised by skilful sky treatment
as to take on a far different 'aspect, and perspective
distortion can likewise be hidden
in many cases, or
made
less conspicuous,
while
the shadows
cast by
clouds can also be used to great advantage, thrown
across a monotonous roof
or wall surface or upon
the ground.
Clouds,
like other accessories, should
never be made too prominent, however.
Some stu-
dents draw the masses so round that the curves
fail
to harmonize with the straight lines of the architec-
ture while others form such "wooly" strokes or such
rough textures that no sense of distance
is obtained,
the clouds seeming nearer perhaps than
the
archi-
tecture
itself.
Each
line and
tone
should
quietly
take
its
place.
So
unless
a
drawing
is
large
or
done
with
a very
bold,
vigorous
technique,
lather
light
but
firm
strokes
would
seem
best,
using
a
medium
or hard
pencil and
striving
for
a
silvery-
gray line,
for smoothness suggests distance.
Again,
as
skies seem
softer
in
effect
and
the
individual
clouds smaller in size and less definite as they recede
towards
the
horizon,
it
is
best,
as
a
rule,
to have
the boldest strokes and the largest and most definite
masses
near
the
zenith.
Storm
clouds,
especially
those
showing
strongly
contrasting
forms
and
values,
are
seldom
desirable
in
architectural work,
and
sunrise or sunset
effects
detract,
unless
skil-
fully handled,
from
the
architecture
itself.
In the actual
representation of clouds two meth-
ods are common, one being the simple indication of
the forms by outline alone
; the other a naturalistic
rendering of the
full tone.
As the former obviously
requires less time
it
is often the more desirable one,
though the choice really depends on what seems de-
manded by
the remainder
of
the drawing.
Avoid
too mechanical an outline in any case, but work in-
stead
for a
suggestion
of
the
variety
of mass and
edge found
in nature,
giving
special
care
to
the
suggestion
of
modelling,
remembering
that
clouds
are not the
flat disks that students sometime repre-
sent them to
be.
Figure 46 shows a number of sketches from na-
ture such as the student should make
for purposes
of study, and several others showing sky treatments
applied
to
architectural
subjects.
We
should
per-
haps remind the reader, before going on, that clouds
are
possibly
the one
thing
in
nature
least
affected
in appearance by man,
for though he may destroy
forests and
alter
shore
lines,
they
continue
to go
their own way uninterrupted.
Now we turn
to a consideration of the represen-
tation of what
is perhaps
the most
difficult of
all
the
architectural
accessories,
the
human
figure.
It
is not our purpose
to discuss
at any
length the
drawing
of
the
individual
figure,
but
rather
to
offer a
few
suggestions
for
the
use
of
figures
as

they
form
a
part
of an
architectural
setting, and
right
at
the
start
it
is
well
to
state
that
it
is
better
to omit
figures
entirely than
to draw them
poorly.
This should not be interpreted to mean that
they must be indicated with photographic accuracy
in
fact,
it
is often possible to suggest them satis-
factorily
in what seems a
rather
careless manner,
omitting
or
subordinating
the
features
and
other
detail,
especially
if
the
scale
is
small.
It
does
mean, however,
that
the
first
impression
gained
when one
looks
at the drawing should
be of pro-
fessional
excellence
rather
than
of an
amateurish
attempt at something beyond one's capabilities.
The
figures should be correct
in
size, as they give
scale
to
the
architecture
itself, and
should
be arranged
in a
natural
disposition,
so grouped
that they
aid,
rather
than
injure,
the
unity and
balance
of
the
composition
;
considerable
practice
is
necessary
to
enable one to do this well.
There should be a pleas-
ing variety,
too,
in
their
selection, using figures of
men, women and children
if many people are shown.
Choose the number and
type,
also,
that are appro-
priate to the location of the building.
In picturing
a
railroad
station,
for
instance, show
people
with
suitcases or hand bags, also railroad porters and the
like.
When drawing an
office building have
busi-
ness men,
stenographers,
postmen,
telegraph
mes-
sengers, etc., with most of the figures in action.
At
a summer hotel, on the other hand, we would
find
people dressed
for bathing,
boating,
riding,
tennis,
golf, and other
sports,
or
leisurely enjoying them-
selves dressed in appropriate summer clothes.
Need-
less
to
say,
fashions should be up-to-date
in
such
a scene, but by
all means avoid the unnatural people
often found in the conventional "fashion drawings."
Be
especially
careful
not
to
have
the
figures
too
straight and
stiff; this
is a very common
fault.
Use
care
also not
to make
foreground
figures
so large
or
important
that
they dwarf
the
architecture
or
lead
the eye from
it.
Occasionally people
so near
as
to be exceptionally prominent are made
slightly
smaller than they would
actually
be,
though
such
liberties should never be taken unless one has suf-
ficient experience to enable him to do so to the best
advantage, and a figure beside the building pictured
should always be
of
correct
size
or a wrong im-
pression of
scale
will be given.
Too many
figures
spotted
around
carelessly
will
destroy
balance,
so,
in composing, plan for the eye to be lead gradually
from one group
to another.
It should
not
be
in-
ferred from this that all drawings demand a number
of
figures,
for this
is not true.
Sketches
of
resi-
dences seldom need more than two or three
at the
most and 'are frequently made with none at
all and
a
single
person
standing
beside
any
building
is
enough to give scale and can be done in a very sim-
ple,
conventional
manner.
Period
costumes
are
sometimes used for such figures, a Colonial lady or
gentleman
being shown,
for
instance,
at
the door
of a Colonial mansion.
Figure 47 shows
at
1
the
steps sometimes gone
through in drawing a figure.
At A the salient points
have been established, at B the outline is completed,
while C gives us the finished result
; D simply adds
a somewhat more
sketchy
indication
of
the
same
person
standing
before
a
window,
and
serves
to
remind us that the technique used for figures should
harmonize
with
that
of
the
rest
of
the
drawing.
At 2
is a quick suggestion of men
walking, while
3 and
5 show
a number
of
action
sketches,
very
hastily
done.
Sketch
4
is
a
bit
of
street
scene
such as might be used as a portion of a large render-
ing.
Perfect drawing and
finish
is by no means
necessary in this sort of work.
Vehicles,
'automobiles,
and
similar
accessories
require
no
special
instructions,
as
catalogues
and
other advertising matter give many
excellent
illus-
trations which can be adapted to the work
at hand.
Be sure to draw them in correct perspective in rela-
tion
to
the
buildings, and
of proper
size;
neither
should you m'ake the mistake of showing any vehicles
drawn or parked on the wrong side of
the
street.
Horses, dogs and other animals require as much
skill
to draw
'as do people and unless one
is
confi-
dent of his ability he will do well to omit them en-
tirely or to get assistance from someone with greater
dexterity.
The reader
is advised to review at this time Chap-
ter VII, Part
I, on Life Drawing, and Chapter VIII.
Part
I, which discusses more
fully the sketching of
animals.

Chapter
XII.
DECORATIVE TREATMENT
WE
HAVE
mentioned
in
previous
chapters
that
all pencil drawings are somewhat con-
ventional
in
treatment,
the
objects
being
rendered more according
to
rule
or precedent than
by attempting
to
duplicate nature
or
fact.
Nature
shows us
color,
for
instance,
which
in
black-and-
white drawings can
be
suggested
only
in a some-
what
meager
manner,
and
she
makes
no
use
of
outline,
so
firmly established by convention
in pen-
cil
representation.
She
gives
us
also
such
ex-
treme
brilliancy
of
sunlight
that
it
is
obviously
impossible
to
adequately
portray
it
on
paper,
so
here
too we
resort
to
convention
for
its
sugges-
tion.
There
are
certain
conventions,
then,
that
are
forced upon us because of our
inability to suc-
cessfully picture some of nature's complexities, but
there are many others which
are entirely
a matter
of choice.
It
is within the power of the skilled art-
ist to approximate,
if he
desires, the forms and the
values
(with
the exception
of
the
more
brilliant
ones)
of
objects
in
nature,
but,
mainly because
it
has been found that such drawings as most closely
approach perfection in this direction are usually too
photographic
in
effect
to
prove
pleasing
from
an
aesthetic
standpoint,
there
has
always
been
an
at-
tempt
to
obtain
a somewhat
individual
interpreta-
tion
rather than mere
excellence
of
depiction.
In
striving
for such expression,
artists have developed
conventional methods of
their own, or have copied
from
their predecessors
and
contemporaries
such
ideas
as have
strongly appealed
to them,
with
the
result
that the student now
finds unlimited sugges-
tions
from which he may
select
those
that he
de-
sires, modifying them
to
suit
his problems and
his
personal
tastes.
Most
draftsmen
have
a
leaning
towards some
definite
type
of
work
;
some
like
the naturalistic,
for instance, while there are others
who take greater pleasure in employing a style which
is more
highly
conventionalized,
adding
a
certain
decorative
quality, perhaps,
to
all
that
they do
;
who so compose their masses and arrange their lines
that regardless of the objects represented
this qual-
ity
is
conspicuous.
Now
the average
architectural
subject
fails to lend
itself readily to such treatment,
as
the tnor
photographic type of work better ex-
presses, from
the
client's
standpoint, the character
of buildings, but there are, nevertheless, some classes
of
drawings
in
which
.''rchitecture
is
prominently
shown, but where composition and
technique of
a
decorative nature seem more
essential than does
a
truthful
delineation
of
the
architecture
itself and
its surroundings, and
it
is
this type with which we
are especially concerned just now.
Rendering of this
sort
is used
for so great a va-
riety
of purposes and
is handled
in
so many
dif-
ferent ways that we can hardly do more here than
attempt to show
its importance, pointing out to the
draftsman that his knowledge of sketching and ren-
dering
will
not
be
well rounded
out
until
he has
given this decorative
style
his careful consideration.
(In
this
connection we
urge
him
to
collect
and
study many examples by
different
artists, copying
such drawings or portions of drawings
as make
a
strong appeal.)
Among the
uses of such drawings may be men-
tioned the
illustration of
types of advertising mat-
ter
in
which
drawings
of
buildings,
or
parts
of
buildings,
are
required
or
the making
of magazine
covers,
the designing of
title pages, or the
illustra-
tion
of
certain
classes
of books and
articles,
such
as
those
pertaining
to
the
purchase
or
furnishing
of
the home
(and
others
of
similar
nature)
or,
again, the drawing of decorative headings, marginal
sketches and
tailpieces.
It
should
not
be
supposed
from
what
is
said
above,
that
architectural
perspectives
of
proposed
buildings
for
submission
to
the
client
cannot
be
done
satisfactorily
in
a
decorative manner,
for
if
the style
is not forced the results may be very pleas-
ing without
detraction from
the
subject, and even
the more naturalistic type of drawing cm be made
somewhat decorative
in
effect,
if
it seems
desirable
to do
so, by
the addition of an ornamental border
or
lettered
inscription
or
something
of
that
sort.
There
are
many
drawings,
however,
wh^re
the
architecture
is
simply a part
of
the decoration,
be-
ing
sometimes
entirely
imaginary
or
perhaps
dis-
torted
into
forms
which
would
be
impossible
to
build
or
undesirable
if
built,
yet which add
nfcely
to
the
decorative
appearance.
In
such work
the
drawing
is not a means to an end
(as
is the average
architectural rendering) but
is an end" in
itself, and
as
its main purpose
is frequently to catch and hold
the
attention,
as
in
advertising work, prominence
is therefore often given
to such
architectural
feat-
ures
as
are
considered
quaint
and
picturesque.
Thatched and
tiled roofs are popular, for example;
as
are
huge
chimneys,
windows
with
shutters
of
unusual design, flower boxes,
lattices, garden gate-
ways,
etc.,
birdhouses, weathervanes and sundials,
rainwater leaders and
leader-heads, door knockers,
ornamental
hinges, and so on.
It
is
not
only
in
the
selection
of
these
details,
however, but
it
is in their arrangement as well that
the
picturesque
is
sought,
for
the
spacing
of
the
windows and doors,
in
fact
all those parts.
often
depends more on what looks interesting and- attrac-
tive than on what would be practical.

SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
for the picturesque
is not confined to the architec-
ture,
for trees and shrubs of
all
sorts are
utilized,
distorted
into any shape and arranged
in any way
that pleases the fancy of the artist.
Flowers of un-
heard-of
species grow
in
curiously
fashioned pots
or
are grouped
in
beds
of
fanciful
design
while
clouds are piled in the sky in a manner wholly with-
out
precedent
in
nature.
The
technique
is
as
varied,
too,
as the
selection,
all
sorts and kinds of
lines being used in every possible way.
One should
not gain
the impression
from
all
this,
however,
that these things are jumbled together in a haphaz-
ard
manner,
for
quite
the
opposite
is
true,
the
greatest
pains
being
usually
taken
that
the com-
pleted whole shall be a beautiful and interesting de-
sign, rendered in an attractive manner, and although
in much of this work the imagination
is given
free
play,
it
is by no means permitted to run
riot.
Many of these decorative renderings are done
in
pen-and-ink
or wash
or some medium
other than
pencil,
but
as
in
nearly
every
case
careful
pencil
preparation
is
required,
regardless
of
the medium
used
for completing the
final drawing,
the
subject
seems to
fall within our scope.
In
fact the impor-
tance
of
such preparation cannot be over empha-
sized.
When a decorative sketch
is desired the cus-
tomary method
of proceedure
is
the same
as we
have explained
for other pencil work,
for once the
artist has conceived
his scheme a number of rough
sketches
are
generally made
first
of
all
at
small
scale, from which
the
best
is
selected
for
further
study,
following
which
larger
scale
sketches
are
drawn,
frequently on
tracing paper and one
over
the other, changes and corrections being performed
as the work progresses.
When
the
design
meets
the requirements and
satisfies the
artist
it
is trans-
ferred to the final paper and completed.
The num-
ber of studies made from start to finish depends on
the
skill of the artist and on the kind and
size and
importance of the problem.
At
"1,"
Figure 48,
is a
"fine
line"
pencil
sketch
of a decorative
nature,
and
yet
the
naturalistic
effect
is not
in
this
case wholly
lost
;
in
fact one
can gain a clear conception of the building and
its
environment
in
spite
of
the
decorative
character
of the rendering.
At "2" and "3" are several other
suggestions, showing a somewhat
similar treatment
of
smaller
subjects, and
in
these,
too,
architecture
of
a
practical nature has been
indicated.
Not infrequently artists make decorative sketches
just
as
a
pastime,
either
combining
existing
ele-
ments,
or fragments
of some
definite
style,
into a
decorative arrangement or composing
fanciful
de-
signs
entirely from the imagination.
In such pro-
jects no limitations of any
sort are present unless
the designer wishes
to impose them upon himself,
so
he
is
able
to
forget
the many
handicaps
that
ordinarily
restrict him
in
every
direction and
find
an opportunity to
lose himself
for the moment
in
these creations of his imagination.
Uses of Color
Mention pencil sketching or ren-
dering to the average individual and he immediately
conjures up in his mind a visualization of the mak-
ing of
the customary type
of drawing such as we
find
in common
use,
done
on
white
paper,
as
a
rule, and with ordinary graphite
pencils.
This
is
only
natural,
for a
large majority
of
sketches are
done with these mediums and in this way, and
it
is
because of the frequency with which they are found
that so much has been written
in previous chapters
referring especially to
this everyday
sort of
repre-
sentation.
There is, however, another class of work which
comes within the scope of our subject yet which
differs in many respects from the type just men-
tioned, and which, in so differing-, offers -so many
opportunities for variety, both in the selection of
materials and in the technique employed, that
it
finds
special
favor among
those who
prefer
to
break away from the commonplace and exercise
their abilities in a less restricted field,
one which
offers,
in
fact, unlimited opportunities
for
indi-
vidual expression.
For
it is our present purpose
to describe briefly some of the uses of papers of
various tints and shades
; to touch upon the em-
ployment
of wax
crayons,
lithographic
pencils
and the like; to point out also a few of the ad-
vantages of colored pencils, and most important
of
all, perhaps, to describe some of the many suc-
cessful combinations of two or more media, such
as
pencil
tinted
with
water
color, water
color
touched up with
pencil, and colored crayon
ac-
cented with brown ink.
A
glance
at
the
appended
list
(on
page
170
concluding this text) which shows some of these
combinations, will emphasize the futility of even
attempting an
adequate
exposition
of our
sub-
ject
within
a
single
chapter,
but
if
the
student
desires to acquire a more complete knowledge of
some of these inexhaustible
possibilities
for ob-
taining effective
results,
let him study such
ex-
amples
as
he
finds
available, and then take
his
own tinted papers and his pencils and colors and
work out for himself
such
ideas
as
make
the
strongest appeal to him.
First of all
it
is well to learn what the market
affords
in
the
way
of
materials
for
such
work,
for too many artists are ignorant of the numerous
kinds of pencils and crayons and papers and the
like that have been prepared
to serve him.
So
multitudinous are these offerings, in fact, and so
varied,
that
to recommend any
particular ones
here might handicap
rather than
help,
for
it
is
best for each student to experiment with all these
things himself.
As an instance of the wealth of
drawing materials at our disposal, inquiry of any
large dealer
in
artist's supplies for black pencils
and
crayons
alone
will
bring
out many
sorts,
each
having
its
individual
characteristics
and
uses.
Some give a shiny and some a dull tint or
tone,
some
are
easily
erased
while
others
smear and smudge when rubbed or are practically
indelible.
There are those which offer resistance
to water, too, and others so soluble as to blur or
wash
off under
its application.
Then again, the
extreme
softness
of some
prevents
a
firm
line
while
in others brittleness makes a sharp point
impossible.
Now just as these pencils vary, so
also do the numerous colored
ones, hence
con-
siderable
testing
is
necessary
if one
desires
to
ascertain
their
possibilities and
limitations, but
once such a knowledge is obtained and along with

SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
it
a
reasonable
facility
in
handling,
it
will
be
realized
that
notwithstanding
these
differences
each kind of pencil or crayon, whether black or
white or colored,
is capable of serving a useful
purpose.
It
is not only
in
pencils and crayons
that we find a wide diversity, however, for papers
are multifarious also, and in addition to the num-
erous
kinds,
both
white
and
colored,
especially
prepared
for
artists,
wrapping
paper,
cover
papers, mat stock and the like are used, even wall
paper
of some
sorts
occasionally
iinding
favor.
The beginner increases
his
difficulties, however,
if he selects papers which do not permit of con-
sideiable erasure.
In this connection attention
is
directed
to the fact that erasers have individual
characteristics,
also,
and
some
which
prove
satisfactory
on
certain
papers,
or
for
erasing
some
grades
of
pencils
or
crayons,
are
useless
with others, so here again personal experimenta-
tion
is
desirable, seeking
all
the
time
for
ideal
combinations of pencil, paper and eraser.
Now
in order
that
the student who
is accus-
tomed to working in the usual manner on white
paper may
become
acquainted
gradually
with
these
materials and methods which
are new
to
him,
it
is suggested that as a
rirst step the same
pencils and
technique
be employed
as
for
this
familiar type
of drawing,
but with some
tinted
paper such
as cream
or
buff or
light gray sub-
stituted for the customary white.
This brings in
little
that
is
different
yet
the
effect
gained
is
often very
interesting, and
if one cares
to go
a
bit further and the subject seems to suggest
it, a
few touches of high
light may be added with
a
white pencil or crayon or with Chinese white or
some
similar water color.
Do not
forget, how-
ever, that water color causes thin paper to wrinkle
and
buckle
out
of
shape
unless
mounted,
and
in-
jures
or
destroys
the
gloss
of
glazed
paper,
though there
is a difference in the appearance of
various
white
pigments when
dry, some
being
flat or
dull and others shiny.
As
the ordinary
pencil
line has more
or
less
gloss, some artists prefer, especially when using
pencils in connection with other mediums, to em-
ploy such kinds as give a
dull
effect.
It
is ad-
visable,
then,
for
the
student
to
become
familiar
with these, so
as soon
as
fairly
satisfactory
re-
sults have been obtained with the usual pencils
on the tinted paper,
it might be well, before
at-
tempting any of the more difficult combinations,
to
try
out,
first
on
white
and
later
on
tinted
paper,
the
various
black
pencils
and
crayons,
making,
perhaps, on
each
sheet
of paper
used
several comparative sketches, for by so doing one
can most
easily
learn
the
adaptability
of
each
'
particular pencil to the paper and to the subject
represented.
Then when numerous experiments
have been made with the black pencils on various
papers try colored pencils.
As their use leads to
new difficulties
it
is best for the beginner to con-
fine
his attempts to one or two
colors, using
a
red or brown tone, for example, making an entire
drawing with the one pencil.
Surprisingly pleas-
ing results are frequently obtained
in
this mari-
ner, the effect being somewhat similar to that of
the
red
chalk drawings
often made by
the
old
masters.
Whereas white paper may be used for
this work, lightly tinted sheets will do nicely too,
offering again
the opportunity
for added
high-
lights
if they
are
felt
to be
desirable.
Though
charming sketches are found
in which pencils or
crayons
of many
colors
have
been
employed,
the
beginner should bear in mind that unless he has
had training in color harmony or has an excellent
innate
color
sense,
the
difficulties
of combining
the various hues
will be far from negligible,
es-
pecially
if the paper
is not white. For this reason
it might be better for him to
first turn his atten-
tion to some of the more simple combinations of
mediums, such as pencil and a wash of monotone.
Some
of
his
old drawings might be
utilized
to
advantage
in
this
connection,
treating them
in
different ways.
Take one of these, for instance,
and run a light wash of yellow ochre or Naples
yellow or some other simple tint uniformly over
the whole
thing, bringing the wash
to an even
edge a quarter of an inch or so outside the mar-
gin
line
all around.
The effect will resemble to
some
extent that obtained by using paper of a
similar
tint,
with
the
one
exception
that
the
pig-
ment will have a tendency to soften the lines of the
pencil, removing more or
less of
the
gloss, and so
"fixing"
the
lines that they
will smudge
less
easily
than
before.
Another scheme
is
to apply a wash
of gray of
a tone somewhat
like that of
the pencil
lines
themselves
to
such
portions
of
the
drawing
as need
to be toned down
or pulled
together.
A
sky may
be
grayed,
for
instance,
in
order
to
in-
crease
the
contrast
of
a
building
against
it,
or a
lawn may be simplified by passing a wash from one
end to the other, and not only are such results often
very pleasing but time can
frequently be saved by
thus combining
the wash work with the
pencil,
as
it
is much quicker as a rule to cover a surface with
the brush than with the smaller point.
Pencils can
be used
very
often
in drawing
fine
detail and
the
brush then taken up
for the larger work, or
if this
larger work has been done with the pencil but the
values seem
too
light or complicated they may be
toned
to
the desired depth
or
satisfactorily
simpli-
fied
by
wash.
For
such work
ivory
black,
lamp
black, neutral
tint,
sepia, india ink or any such pig-
ments
will do
or a ..gray can be mixed by combin-
ing two or more neutralizing colors.
Now
just
as
tints
of monotone can be used
in
connection with pencil work so can tints of several
hues,
in
fact the author has found that a great de-
mand
exists among the architects
for such render-
ings, as they afford an opportunity for a suggestion
of the colors of the building materials and the sur-
roundings,
thus adding greater
interest and
value.
As
a
rule a drawing
to be
so
tinted
is completed
in the usual manner in pencil and then very trans-
parent washes of the desired hues are flowed over
the
various
parts.
When using
this method
there
are
several
points worth remembering, and
one
is
that the color should be applied
in very
light
tints
rather than
in' more nearly
its
full intensity, for the
result should count
pri'ilarily as pencil work, with
the
tints
of
secondary
importance,
and much
of
the charm
is lost if the colors do become so conspic-
uous
as
to
compete
with
the
pencilling
for
su-
premacy.
If
such prominent color
is
desired
it
is

better to make the usual
sort of water color draw-
ing and be done with
it, so subordinating the pen-
cilling that it becomes in itself almost negligible, serv-
ing simply as a guide for the color work.
Another
point
is that when tints are to be used, whether of
monochrome or varied colors,
it
is well to
first flow
one
or two washes
of
clear water over the
entire
paper, for this will remove the shine of the pencil
to a
large
extent,
thus
insuring
greater harmony
between
the
pencil
strokes
and
brush
work,
and
will
at
the same time
act
as
a cleansing agent
re-
moving
superfluous
pencil
dust and
preparing
the
paper surface
for the subsequent
tints.
Again, as
some
tints are quite transparent and
others
rather
opaque, a c;ireful choice should be made, the trans-
parent ones being generally considered best for this
sort of work.
As
the
chief
objection
made
to
tinted
pencil drawings
is
that
the
shiny
lines and
dull
washes
have
dissimilar
characteristics,
it
is
better, when
it
is known
in advance
that
washes
are to be applied, to select one of the special pencils
that gives a dull instead of a glossy line, thus avoid-
ing any unpleasantness from
this source.
As some
pencils such as the lithographic ones offer
little
re-
sistance to water, however, they are hardly suitable
for such work, so
if a new kind of pencil
is used,
tests should be made beforehand
to make sure the
line
will
stand washing.
This brings
us
to another method of combining
pencil
and
color,
one which
is
perhaps
less com-
monly used but which
offers
at the same time op-
portunity
for
excellent
results,
especially
in
the
making of quick sketches.
In
this method the ob-
ject pictured
is outlined
in pencil
in the usual way
and
washes
of
water
color
are
added, much
as
would be done
in making the regular sort of water-
color
sketch.
When
the
general
tones have
been
thus
obtained,
a pencil which
will
give
a
dull
line
is selected and used for adding accents and
finish-
ing touches
:
usually
this
is
black
but
sometimes
one or more colored
pencils prove more
effective.
These need
not, of course, be proof against wa*er
as they are not employed
until
the surface
is
dry.

were
touched
up
with
litho-
graphic
pencil
after the washes were applied, thus
illustrating
the method
just
described.
A
similar
method
offers a means
of improving such portions
of water-color renderings .as become muddy, losing
their crispness and
directness, for under such con-
ditions a few touches
or accents
of colored
pencil
or crayon
or
pastel
often do much towards over-
coming
the
difficulties
and
securing
the
desired
effect.
There are,
in
fact, numerous ways of com-
bining water
color and
colored
pencils
pleasingly,
washes
being
sometimes
applied
over
the
pencil
work,
in
contrast
to
the method
just
mentioned.
Occasionally ink lines are added to these others,
in
fact very effective results can be obtained on tinted
paper by
sketching
in
the forms with brown
ink,
next adding a few washes
of
color,
finally touch-
ing up
the whole
with
crisp
strokes
of
black
or
colored
pencils.
Colored
pencils
alone
produce
pleasing
results
also,
especially
if
used
on
tinted paper or board,
and a very satisfactory combination
is gray or buff
board, brown
ink, one or two colored
pencils and
a white pencil or Chinese white.
So numerous are the possibilities of thus employ-
ing several mediums
in one sketch that we cannot
hope to describe them
all here,
in
fact, words
fail
to convey an adequate
impression
of
such
subtle-
ties
of
tone and
color,
so we must
leave
the
stu-
dent to perform his own experiments and arrive at
his own
results.
Before
closing,
though,
just
an-
other word regarding papers and some of the me-
diums best
suited to
special
surfaces.
The kid-finish
bristol board such as we have pre-
viously recommended
for pencil
work
takes
light
tints
nicely and does not warp badly
if the
entire
surface of the sheet
is
first wet with water.
If
it
should buckle out of shape
in spite of this precau-
tion
it may be thoroughly dampened after the ren-
dering
is entirely completed, and put to press for a
few
hours
between
two drawing
boards
held
to-
gether with weights.
Thin drawing papers are best
if mounted
before
the washes
are
applied.
Then
even if they do wrinkle somewhat as they are damp-
ened, they
will dry back into
shape.
Some grades
of
tracing paper
are
excellent
for wash work
if
floated or stretched beforehand, or
if used without
stretching they permit of
interesting results of an-
other kind, for
if quite thin, colored pencils may be
effectively used on the back of the paper,
just as
is
frequently done in preparing house plans, thus per-
mitting the color to show through, or delicate tones
of pastel may be rubbed on the front, accented with
as many
pencil
lines
as seem
necessary.
Another
useful
fact
is
that
regardless
of how white
in ap-
pearance
tracing
paper may
seem
to
be,
Chinese
white
will
always
stand
out
against
it
distinctly,
hence
it
is useful
for highlights.
One of the most
effective
kinds
of quick
sketches
is made by
first
outlining
the masses
with
brown
ink on
tracing
paper, next pencilling the darker tones
in black or
such
a_ color as
conditions seem
to demand,
finally
adding
Chinese
white
on
the
lighter
portions.
Brown ink is recommended for such purposes rather
than
black
as
the
lines seem
less hard and mech-
anical and harmonize because of their color with the
other mediums,
and
at
the
same
time
better
rep-
resent the hues of such materials as brick,
tile, tim-
ber work, etc., which are often of a color similar to
that of the ink
itself.
The
illustrations accompanying this chapter show
some
of
the
combinations
here
described
but
it
should be understood
that
in the
processes
of
re-
production
the
effect of the
originals
is somewhat
changed,
this
being
especially
true
of the
tints
of
the papers on which the drawings are made.
The
three
sketches on Figure 49 were
all done by the
same method on
a charcoal
paper
of
a
greenish
gray hue.
This paper was allowed to represent the
middle values while the dark tones were made with
a black pencil which was purchased as one of a
set
of
colored
pencils.
The
white was done
for
the
most
part with
pencil,
too, being added gradually
as the work progressed, but as
it proved difficult to
keep the point
sufficiently sharp
for the
finer

to the

tones,

Chinese white was

Chapter

LARGE BUILDINGS
IN
THE preceding chapters
the
greater
part
of
our space has been devoted to describing methods
of sketching or rendering the small type of build-
ing such as the average student or draftsman usually
desires
to
draw,
so
although much
that
has
been
contained in them relates also to such larger subjects
as
office buildings,
hotels, theatres, churches and the
like,
it seems wise to
offer some suggestions which
apply
especially
to
their
handling,
supplementing
these with a
few
additional
facts not yet discussed
in
this volume
applicable
to
the treatment
of
both
small and
large
structures.
When a proposed building of such magnitude
as a hotel or court house or railway station
is to
be
represented
in
perspective
there
are
many
architects and
clients who prefer
to
see
it done
in water color or wash,
or,
if the drawing
is
to
be
reproduced,
pen-and-ink
is
popular
because
of
the
ease
of
getting
a good
reproduction
at
comparatively low
cost.
Pencil, then,
is perhaps
less
in demand
as
a medium
for
large
subjects
than
it
is for smaller ones, but there
is, neverthe-
less, enough
call
for
it
to make
its study essen-
tial.
It should be borne
in mind
also that
the
pencil
plays
a most
important
part
in
laying
out subjects
to be rendered
in water
color, pen
and ink and other mediums,
in
fact
it
is
diffi-
cult indeed to make an excellent color rendering
unless the instrumental pencilling has been very
carefully prepared, and
it
is
quite an
art
to do
this
well,
for
certain
profiles,
lines
of
division
between
light and shade,
etc..
are
often
best
if
accented or strengthened, while subordination
is
necessary
in
some
other
parts.
When
such
a
layout
is
complete and
before
the
color
is
ap-
plied,
free-hand
pencil
lines
are
often
added
to
indicate the brick
courses,
etc.,
a
texture being
thus
obtained which
could
not be
gained
with
the brush alone.
Even for a pen drawing where
the pencil layout simply serves as a guide for the
ink
lines
it must be prepared with
care, though
no great attention need be given to the neatness
of the draftsmanship as the
lines will be erased
or obliterated as the pen work progresses.
It
is not this pencil preparation
for rendering
in other mediums which
especially
interests
us
at
this
time, however, but
rather the
free hand
completion
of
a
pencil
rendering
after
the
in-
strumental
layout has been made.
lust
a word
first, though, regarding this layout.
To begin with,
it
is of course necessary to
select such
a paper
or board as
is known to be satisfactory
for the
free-hand
pencil
work,
then
in
drawing
the
in-
strumental
lines
it
is best to use a hard enough
pencil to permit later cleaning of the paper with
a
soft
eraser without
entirely
effacing them,
a
2H or 3H answering very well
for such
a pur-
pose, the choice depending,
of
course,
on
the
nature
of
the
paper,
too
hard
a
pencil
or
too
much pressure forming such deep grooves as to
mar
the
perfection
of
the
finished work
or
es-
pecially
those
parts
of
it which
are
to remain
the tone
of the paper
itself, whereas too
soft
a
pencil
will
leave
hardly enough
of
a
guide
to
be
easily
followed
after
the
paper
is
cleaned.
This
layout, although
it must be accurate, need
not be
quite
so
carefully drawn
or
at
least
so
fully completed as would be necessary for wash
or color work,
unless, as
is sometimes the
case,
part
of
the
lines
are
to
be
left
in
the
finished
rendering,
then,
of
course, extreme
care
is
es-
sential.
Once the layout has been completed
it
is ad-
visable
for the
student
to make,
just as
for
small-
er work, a preliminary study or two, as a means
of deciding the values and working out a pleas-
ing composition of the surroundings,
in fact be-
cause of the amount
of time and labor involved
in making a
large rendering such
preliminaries
are even more
essential
than
for
smaller prob-
lems, and
an
hour
or two
spent making them
will
usually
result
not
only
in
the
saving
of
several
hours
in
the end but
at
the same time
in
better
work.
(It seems
hard,
however,
to
impress
this
fact
on
students,
who
therefore
waste much time
trying
to render without any
definite plan
in mind).
Such studies are usually
made on tracing paper
directly over the
layout
and the best
selected and saved
as
a guide
for
completing the drawing.
On work of such mag-
nitude
a
diminishing
glass
is
often
of
help
in
making
both
the
layout
and
the
final
as
it
is
possible by
its use to reduce the whole to a size
easily seen without shifting the eye.
Setting the
drawing away
at
a distance of several
feet
will
accomplish the same
result.
If the preliminary sketch
is well done
it
will
be possible for the student in starting the
finish-
ed rendering to begin at the top of the sheet and
work down, completing the drawing as he goes,
with the exception of a few
final touches which
will probably be necessary
at the
last moment.
In
order
to do
this
successfully,
however,
the
preliminary must be carefully worked out, special
care being taken to see that there
is a center of
interest for the entire composition and that unity
and
balance
are
obtained,
for
it
is
generally
true
that
the
larger and more
complicated
the
sub-
ject the more likely the student
is to be led into
overaccenting
relatively unimportant
parts.

soon as this sketch
is completed and "fixed" for
preservation the rendering of the final
is started,
pencils of several grades being prepared before-
hand as described
in
a previous
article.
Begin-
ning at the top, then, and working as a rule from
left
to
right,
a
strip an
inch
or two
in height can
be
completed
at
one
time,
for
instance
if
a
balustrade forms the crowning feature of a build-
ing this and the cornice beneath might be finish-
ed
first,
next the upper
story,
then
the
story
below and so on down until the street is reached,
adding the surroundings
as
the
rest progresses
or completing them
after
the
building
itself
is
finished.
Finally
it may be necessary to go back
to touch
up
here
and
there,
as
has
just
been
mentioned
above,
adding
a
bit
of
tone
in
one
place,
lifting a
little
in another, until the results
are
satisfactory.
Some
teachers
and
artists
would
doubtless
criticise
this
method
as
not
being
conducive
to
the
best
results
but
it
at
least
offers the
great advantage of reducing the
difficulty of keeping the drawing crisp and clean,
which means much
to the
architect, who
takes
little
pleasure
in
smeared
or
soiled
drawings.
Perhaps a more logical method, however, would
be to render at the center of interest
first as has
been mentioned
in a former discussion
of smal-
ler
problems,
gradually
carrying
the work
to-
wards
the
edges,
thus
building
up
the
entire
drawing as a unit, going back over the different
parts as often as may prove necessary, to change
them or correct them.
Whatever method
is
fol-
lowed,
however,
perseverance
is
the
one
thing
most
needed.
There seem
to
be many
drafts-
men
willing to attempt
to render comparatively
small subjects and who succeed with them nice-
ly yet who shun such buildings
as we are
con-
sidering
here,
though
-mere
size
seldom
brings
difficulties greater than are found in work of less
magnitude, and so should not cause one to refrain
from
attempting
to
represent
them.
in
fact
small residences with
their irregular plans, slop-
ing
roofs, numerous chimneys
and
the
like,
to
say nothing of their variety of building materi-
als,
are
often
far
more
difficult
in
proportion
to
their
size
than
are
the
bigger
structures.
Again, the smaller the building as a general rule
the larger the scale at which
it
is drawn, simple
residences
being
sometimes
done,
for
instance,
at a scale of Y%" or J^" to the foot and seldom at
less than J4", whereas larger buildings are more
often %"
or &", thus reducing such
details
as
windows to a size too small to require much labor.
Of course the greater mass of a big building does
make
necessary
the
expenditure
of more
time
and patience than are usually demanded by one
which
is
small, because of the mere
effort need-
ed
to
cover
the
extensive
area
of
paper,
and
some such complicated
subjects
as
Gothic
ca-
thedrals doubtless
call for more
skill as well.
It
is
usually
lack
of
persistency
rather than
lack
of
skill, however, that causes the failures among
attempted
renderings
of
large
subjects, though
it
is nevertheless true, paradoxical though
it may
seem, that those renderings which are completed
by students
or draftsmen attempting large

jects for the
first time, often show as their great-
est
fault
overstudy
rather
than
lack
of
study
and too much
detail rather than too
little.
Too
often
every window
is
indicated
with
painful
precision,
while
not
a
brick
or
stone
course
is
slighted or omitted.
Though such conscientious-
ness
about
the
detail
is
frequently
found,
too
little attention
is given as a rule to the study of
the effect as a whole,
it
is
for
this reason that
we
are laying such
stress on the importance of
the preliminary
study.
The
amount
of
time
spent
on
a
drawing
should depend
largely on
its
purpose,
a
few
hours answering for some problems while sever-
al
days
or
even
a week may
be
required
for
others.
It should be remembered that most ren-
derings
are
drawn
for
a
practical
reason,
to
show the architect or client how a building will
look when completed.
The drawing has, there-
fore, a limited and a somewhat temporary value.
Naturally,
then,
the
person
paying
for
it
can
seldom afford a larger amount than the drawing
is expected to be worth to him, and this will de-
pend on
its purpose.
As we have previously ex-
plained, some
renderings
are simply
studies

help
the
architect
to
visualize
his
design,
more,
perhaps,
are
to make
its
appearance
clear
to
the
client.
Others
are
submitted
to
banks
as
an
aid
in
obtaining
loans
for
building
purposes,
while
some,
again,
are drawn
for
publicity
or
advertising uses, perhaps reproduced in circulars
or magazines, the
original being exhibited, pos-
sibly,
in
a show window
or
other conspicuous
place.
It
is
evident,
then,
that
the
delineator
must, as
in
smaller work, prepare
the
kind
of
drawing demanded by
his particular problem,
if a rough, quick sketch
will answer
as
well
as
any other that is the kind to make by
all means.
It
is necessary, therefore, to ascertain
all the
re-
quirements right at the start. The architect him-
self
is
often
at
fault
in
not giving
the
delineator
sufficiently
plain
directions,
forgetting
that
a
project which
is
clear
in
his own mind
is
not
equally
so
in
the minds
of
others.
Or he
will
ask, perhaps, for a rough, sketchy drawing, "just
a few hours work," and then on seeing
it either
completed
or
partially drawn
will
object
emphat-
ically and vociferously to the inaccuracies of incom-
pleteness of this or that small
detail.
The architect
should endeavor
to make
plain
beforehand
just
what
is needed, and the artist should try equally
hard
in turn to successfully
fill the requirements,

remembering that the architect is the one who
is
paying for the job.
In order to do
this
it may
be necessary for him to be familiar with several
kinds
of
technique,
for
sometimes
very
bold
drawings
will be demanded, strong
in
contrasts
and
vigorous
in
treatment,
while
again
prefer-
ence will be shown for a more delicate type with
the
detail more
accurately
handled.
Drawings
of
the bold type
are often on
rather rough paper
while
the
others
are more
frequently
done
on
a
smoother
surface.
There
are
architects, however,
who
while they wish
the general
effect of
a
ren-
dering
to
be
rather bold,
at
the same time
desire
greater
accuracy,
even
in
the
smaller
parts,
than
can be obtained
easily on a rough textured paper.
This
demand
has
caused
the
introduction
of
a
rather interesting trick, the building itself being laid
out
first of
all
in the usual way instrumental!/ on
a good
quality tracing
paper
and
rendered
quite
carefully and completely with the desired attention
given to
the smaller
details, nothing being done to
the
surroundings,
however,
at
this
stage.
Before
they are rendered the tracing paper is loosened from
the board and a rather rough sheet of cardboard or
paper or even of cloth is put beneath the drawing and
the rendering of the entourage then done, the pencil
lines on
the tracing paper taking an impression of
the rough surface below.
Then the building itself
can
be touched up
a
bit, enough
to
bring
it
into
harmony
with
the
surroundings,
and
the
tracing
mounted on
a
stiff board, which,
if
rather rough,
will add to the
effect desired.
This same idea can
of course be utilized
in the making of drawings of
less pretentious subjects, as can another trick which
it may be worth while to mention, though
it
is more
frequently
used
in
connection
with
color
work.
This
trick
is borrowed from
the printers and con-
sists
in
running
finished
renderings,
usually
done
on a
fairly smooth paper, through heavy machines
containing
rollers which are designed
to press pat-
terns onto the paper, such surfaces as eggshell, linen,
crash, canvas, moire,
etc., being obtainable.
These
surfaces may seem
a
bit
artificial
but
the
idea
is
handed on for what
it
is worth.
Perhaps
it
is well
as
a word
of
caution
to mention
that
this process
often makes
the paper
slightly
smaller,
destroying
the accuracy of
the
dimensions.
Then
there
is one more
addition
to
our
list of
tricks,
this
idea having been stumbled upon
quite
by chance by the author, though the same thing has
perhaps been done many times by
others.
As the
muntins and meeting
rails
of windows,
as
well as
.
other
similar
architectural
members,
are
usually
left white on small
scale pencil drawings, consider-
able
labor
is
sometimes
involved
in
so
darkening
the glass or adjacent members
as
to
leave
them
sharp and clean
cut.
It has been found
that
if
a
pencil drawing is being done on a fairly thick board,
such
as
the
illustration boards
in common
use,
it
is possible to rule these small members with a clean
ruling pen or
dull knife point or anything of that
nature, pressing a groove into the surface for each
white
line
desired,
using
care
of
course
that
the
instrument employed
is perfectly clean and that the
lines
start and stop
at just the
right points.

with a
little practice one can learn
to pass two
or
three
strokes
of
the
pencil
over
each
window,
grooves and
all, toning the various parts to the de-
sired
values, using
a
similar process wherever the
grooves are employed.
If
the pressure
is not too
great and
the point
is rather blunt the
pencil
will
pass
over
the
grooves
without
darkening
them,
leaving them instead to appear as white
lines.
Af-
ter a day or two or as soon as the paper has become
damp
(it may
be
lightly
washed
or
sprayed
with
water if desired)
the grooves themselves practically
disappear, simply leaving the white
lines.
Possibly
the
greatest
objection
to
this way
of
working
is
that the lines
so formed sometimes seem a
bit too
perfect in relation to those drawn more freely with
the
pencil,
yet on drawings
at
small
scale enough
time can frequently be saved by this method to make
a knowledge of
it worth having.
So much
in
regard
to
the
architectural handling
of large
buildings.
For
additional
suggestions
see
the
previous
chapters
of
this
book,
nearly
all
of
which
offer something
related
to our present
sub-
ject, and study the numerous examples of rendering
that have appeared from place to place
in the text.
We
should
not
close
our
discussion
of
the
rendering
of
large
buildings
without
some
refer-
ence
to the very sketchy and
often
rather
impres-
sionistic
type
of
drawing
in
which
the
architec-
ture
is treated from
the
point of view
of
the
art-
ist rather than of the
architect,
and
which,
there-
fore,
gives
special
attention
to
the
effect
of
the
whole and
not
to
the
almost
photographic
repre-
sentation of the architectural detail common
to the
work
of
the
architect and
the
professional
delin-
eator.
In drawings of
this
type,
for
instance, the
whole
is treated very broadly, some of the windows
being merely suggested, perhaps, or omitted entirely,
while
practically
all
of
the
tiny members such
as
dentils
are
left
out.
Such
drawings
!are
usually
more
interesting than
the architectural type,
partly
because more
is
left
to
the imagination and partly
because of the absence of mechanical perfection of
line.
(In fact many are made entirely freehand from
start
to
finish).
Again,
the
accessories may
be
treated
with
greater
freedom
as no
reason
exists
for suppressing them,
so
all-in-all, when
the
art-
ist draws architecture the
results are better from a
purely
aesthetic
standpoint than
those
obtained by
the
average
architect
or
architectural
delineator,
who
is of necessity usually forced to show so much
detail
(in
order
to make
the
design
clear
to
the
client)
as
to prevent
the most
artistic
result.
Then
there
is
another form
of work
in which
large buildings
are shown
but where
they become
subordinate
to
something
else.
As
examples
of
this we have
advertisements
of
automobiles
and
clothing and the
like, where the buildings are sim-
ply a
setting or background.
Here
of
course the
greatest freedom
in
their treatment
is
permissible,
the
slightest
suggestion
of
the
architecture
often
sufficing.
So much variety
is found in all this sort of work
that we can hardly do more than mention
it here,
and bring emphasis to the fact that the outstanding
difference between
this and
the
architectural
type
is, as we have mentioned, the greater freedom used
in the former
in
relation to the
latter.
This
free-
dom
is not confined
to the technique but
is found
in
the composition
also, and
in
the
general
treat-
ment,
moonlight
or
evening
scenes,
sunsets,
rainy
day effects and the like being popular.
Even though
these
are
not common
in
architectural
work,
it
would be well
for the student of architectural ren-
dering to study
all
this sort of thing, as much can
be learned from
it which
is adaptable with modifi-
cations
to his own problems.
Whether the student
desires
to
better
his
ability
to do architectural renderings or whether
it
is this
other work which
interests him
most,
there
is no
better training in either case than to sketch directly
from buildings.
It is by making many such sketches
as that by Otto F. Langmann on page 181 from the
big buildings
themselves
that one can
get a
strong
grasp on how to handle them.
Now
of
these
various
types
of
drawings
our
illustrations
have been
selected
from
those
of
an
architectural
nature.
Figure
52,
page
175,
is
the
reproduction
of
a
very
quick
sketch
of
a
pro-
posed
building
done
on
tracing
paper
with
a
lithographic
pencil.
Unfortunately
this
reproduc-
tion
is reduced from
so
large
a drawing
that
the
values show stronger contrasts
in many ways than
on the original,
making
the
whole
lighting
seem
somewhat unnatural and
artificial.
It
will
serve to
show, however,
that such
a drawing, even though
hastily
done
without
preliminary
study,
conveys
the
general
impression
of
the proposed
structure.
Figure
53, page
178, was done
at much
smaller
scale
(ys-inch
to the
foot)
with ordinary graphite
pencils.
Both of these
illustrations show compara-
tively
simple
buildings,
simple
indeed
so
far
as
general mass
is concerned, and
in presenting them
we wish
to point out a truth not commonly recog-
nized
by
the
beginner who
attempts
this
sort
of
work, and
this
is that
it
is more
difficult to get an
interesting
representation
of
simple masses of
this
type than of buildings having towers or domes
or
pediments or, in
fact, any irregular shaped features.
Even the
outline drawing of a domed
structure
is
full
of
interest
before
the
rendering
is
started,
whereas the block forms or skeletons of such build-
ings
as we are picturing here seem very common-
place, which means that greater care must be given
to the rendering.
Choose, then, for your early prac-
tice,
structures
with domes
or towers
which
will
form interesting silhouettes and you will find
it less
difficult
to
obtain
good
results,
saving
the
more
simple forms for later practice.
This seems strange,
perhaps, but
it
is true.
Figure
51, page
172, was also made
at the
scale
of y&" to the foot, on kid-finished bristol board, and
in this case the main lines were drawn instrumentally
and
left
to show
in
the
final
result,
the
free-hand
work being added
to them.
This building,
like the
others, is very simple in general mass, but because of
the trees
it was possible to avoid the rather hard and
uninteresting outline against the sky which we
find
in Figure
53.

SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
The admirable rendering by Hugh Ferriss of Bush
House, London,
England, on
page
174, was done
after the designs for the building had reached a defi-
nite stage and as the surroundings were well known
it was possible to produce a drawing which conveys
a
very
convincing
and
realistic
impression
;
one
which while showing considerable detail
is not with-
out atmospheric
effect.
A carbon
pencil was used
for
this
rendering
which
was
made
on
a
fairly
smooth, heavy drawing board.
Attention
is directed
also to the smaller reproductions of masterly render-
ings by Mr.
Ferriss on pages
173 and
176.
On page
177
is an
exceptional
example
of
fine
line
treatment
of
a
large
building,
by
Chester
B.
Price, the subject being the new structure for S. W.

City.
Al-
though
a
close
inspection
of
this
reproduction
re-
veals
that every
essential
detail
of
the
architecture
has
been
shown,
the drawing
has,
nevertheless,
a
remarkable breadth of
effect and a most commend-
able simplicity.
Two other drawings of large build-
ings done by Mr.
Price
have
been
reproduced
on
page 183, opposite, and these, too, are worthy of the
most careful study on the part of the student.
The sketch by Robert A. Lockwood on page 180
is a very virile interpretation of a building in course
of construction.
Subjects of this
sort are excellent
for
the
student
to attempt.
\Ye have already mentioned the delightful
sketch
by Mr. Langmann on page
181.
This
is one of a
series which Mr. Langmann has made of interesting
groupings of New York
buildings,
old
and
new,
approaching his subjects in much the same way that
the travelling student of architecture sketches
build-
ings and groupings abroad.
The original from which
this
particular
reproduction was made
is
in
litho-
graphic
pencil on white paper.
Now study and analyze
all these various examples
carefully and
try
to
obtain
others
of
your
own.
Copy parts of them,
if you wish, but
in doing
so
remember
that
the amount
of
reduction
in
size
is
considerable, so allow for this while doing your copy-
ing.
Next go ahead with larger subjects, but in this
work as in the sketching of smaller buildings it mighr
be
well
to make
first
a number
of
sketches from
photographs, and when larger subjects of an original
sort are undertaken do not forget what we have said
about the importance
of the preliminary
study.
It
is
often a good
plan,
if an architectural
rendering
of
a
big
building
is
being
attempted
for
the
first
time, to select photographs and reproductions of ren-
derings of
similar buildings viewed from about the
same point, and to keep these around you for study
and comparison
all
the
time
that you
are working
on your preliminary study and on the
final render-
ing
itself.
And above
all do
not
lose your
confi-
dence
and
patience
simply
because
the
subject
is
large.

Chapter XIV.
CONCLUSION
IF
ONE desires to learn to draw, let him draw and
draw and
draw.
The
author
wishes
that
this
message might remain fixed in the mind of every
reader
of
these
chapters,
for even those who have
had
the patience to
follow them through from the
very
first to this the concluding one, will profit
little
by them unless such ideas as have been acquired are
put
to
practice
before
they
are
forgotten,
as
it
is
only
by
drawing
over
and
over
again
until
such
assimilation
has
taken
place
as
will
enable
one
to
make unconscious use of them, that they will prove
of more than
partial and transitory
value.
Yet
it
is not enough
to
draw,
without
plan
or
reason,
for one gets even through
faithful practice
far
less gain than
should be
rightfully
his,
unless
he
follows a logical system, adopting some scheme
which
seems
best
suited
to
his
individual
require-
ments.
For what might be
logical
for one might
be illogical indeed for another.
There are students,
for
instance,
so imbued
with
earnestness and
en-
thusiasm, so passionately fond of drawing, that they
seize
with
avidity
every
hint
or
suggestion which
is
offered
as an
aid
to
the development
of
their
talent, and who
at
the same time
possess enough
common
sense
to
realize
their own
shortcomings
and weaknesses and to direct their own energies to
the best advantage
in
their
attempt
to
overcome
them, so planning their study and practice that they
move on step-by-step up a road of steady progress.
Such men
are also
occasionally
so
fortunate
as
to
have the somewhat rare ability of judging correctly
the merits of their own work, being able to view
it
impartially from a wholly unbiased standpoint, act-
ing as their own
critics with considerable
success.
Needless
to
say men
of
this
type
are
scarce,
however, the average student falling into one or an-
other
of
three
classes,
the
first
including
such
as
either underrate their own ability or are easily
dis-
heartened, the second and largest class consisting of
those
having
a
fair amount
of
ability and
confi-
dence coupled with a willingness to work, and with
an excellent
attitude towards the acceptance of
in-
struction and criticism, the third being made up of
a few
such
vain
and
self-conceited
individuals
as
hold
the
egotistical opinion
that
their work
is the
acme
of
perfection,
ignoring
with
thinly
masked
ridicule
the
suggestions
of
their
instructors
and
fellow
students,
seemingly ignorant or
careless
of
the
fact that their attitude of antagonism
is deter-
rent to their own progress.
Now the student of
this
first
class needs a guid-
ing hand and word of encouragement,
for once he
gains
a
reasonable amount
of
confidence
in
him-
self and
his own
ability
his advancement
is
fre-
quently rapid.
Such a student should by
all means
join
a
class or work under a
critic
or patron,
as
otherwise he may
lack
the
necessary
incentive
to
inspire him
to
the achievement which
is
possible,
and
neither
should
he be
discouraged by
adverse
criticism.
Especially
if
one
is
self-conscious
and
supersensitive he should
strive
to become
so
thor-
oughly immersed
in
his work as
to grow
forgetful
of
self and unmindful of unfavorable comment or
the gibes of the thoughtless.
Students
of
the
second
class, which
includes
a
large percentage of
all the men
interested
in such
drawing,
should
put
themselves
under
instruction
also,
either
attending
school
(many
night
schools
offer courses
for those to whom day attendance
is
impossible)
or,
if
no
organized
classes
are
avail-
able, gathering as a group to form a sketch club, meet-
ing once a week or so to compare work and receive
criticism from each other or, better yet, from some
capable
critic engaged
for
the
purpose.
Or
if
it
seems
impractical
to
join or form a
club or
class
it
is
all the more important to work under an able
teacher.
As
far
as
the
architectural draftsman
is
concerned this should be easy, especially in the larger
cities, as capable men may be found in nearly every
office, glad to give their services either gratuitously
or
for
reasonable compensation.
The
choice of a
teacher or
critic should not be made hastily, how-
ever,
for
it
is not enough that he be a skilled
artist,
for many who draw
exquisitely
well
cannot
tell
how
they do
it
or what
is wrong with
another's
work.
Again some
teachers
are
so dogmatic and
opinionated as to try to force their own ideas upon
all
their students
rather than
to
aid
in developing
the individuality of each.
So make your choice with
care,
but once you
go
to
a
teacher,
put
yourself
under his
direction
unreservedly, and even though
you sometimes
fail
to agree with him or with
his
corrections or criticisms, try to get his viewpoint, to
see from
his
eyes,
as
his
vision may
be
broader
than your own.
It
is
not always wise
to remiin
under
the
instruction
of
one man
for too long
a
time, however, as there
is sometimes a tendency to
mimic
his
style, but
it
is better,
instead,
to change
after a while, gaining new
inspiration and help by
the fresh contact.
But we are digressing a
bit from our considera-
tion of the three various
classes of students so
let
us
return
to
discuss
the
third,
the
conceited
lot.
Perhaps the less said about them the better, for such
men are well-nigh hopeless unless they can be made
to see the light, and this
is not easy
if they are con-
firmed
egotists.
But some men
are
egotists
only
so
far
as
their drawing
ability
is
concerned,
and
for
these
there
is
hope.
This
condition
is
some-
times
brought
about
because
friends
or members
of a
student's
family
or possibly teachers have
in
their ignorance or in
their desire
to
flatter, heaped

PENCIL SKETCH BY OTTO
F. LANGMANN.
A BIT OF OLD NEW YORK

SKETCHING AND RENDERING IN PENCIL
unwarranted praise upon him, causing him to arrive
at false conclusions as to his ability and knowledge.
If such a man
joins a
class
or sketch
club, how-
ever,
the
truth
will generally be
forced upon him
sooner or later that his work, when compared with
that by others, lacks the perfection which he imag-
ined
it to possess.
We should not go on without some mention of
the man who earnestly desires
to draw but whose
efforts
bring
him
little
reward.
Such
a person
should
try
over
and
over
again.
Then
if
after
repeated attempts improvement seems as
far away
as ever,
failure may be quite properly attributed to
lack of natural
ability, in which case
it
is doubtless
better
to give up the hope of ever becoming more
than mediocre, seeking perhaps to win greater suc-
cess
in some other direction,
for even the man of
real
ability has no easy
task
to
gain
recognition.
But do not
let discouragement deter you from
re-
peated
trial,
for many who show
little promise
in
their early work persevere until
their
results show
amazing improvement.
The
reader can
readily understand
that
in con-
sideration
of
these many
types
of men who
are
studying
these
chapters, men
at
various
stages
of
progress and development,
too, ranging
all the way
from
beginners
with
their
first
problems
to men
professionally engaged
in some form of art work,
it
is
impractical
to
lay down definite courses of study
here.
Disappointment
has
perhaps
been
felt
by
some that more actual problems have not been given,
but
it has seemed best, under the conditions, to offer,
instead, general suggestions, hoping to make the stu-
dent see what things
it
is essential for him to know,
and to point out the way for acquiring such knowl-
edge.
And so in Part
I we have discussed among other
things the preliminary preparations, the drawing of
objects in outline and light and shade, the principles
of
free-hand
perspective,
methods
of
doing
cast
drawing
and
life
drawing, and
the
sketching
of
animals; and we have tried to make the reader
see
that whether he
is
interested
in
art or
architecture
all such training is of benefit to him.
We have touched here
in Part
II on the prepara-
tion of drawing materials, the choice of subjects to
draw and how to begin.
We have written on such
matters
as
individual
style
and
method
and
on
different ways of obtaining
results
in
outline
and
light-and-shade and
flat and graded tones, and have
devoted considerable space
to the important subject
of composition with attention to unity and
balance.
We have discussed working from the
object, from
the photograph and from nature, and have covered
in
special
chapters
the
representation
of
buildings
both
small and
large,
including
exteriors,
interiors
and street scenes, while the treatment of their details
and accessories has been broad, too, offering sugges-
tions
for
the
handling
of
furniture and
draperies,
doors, windows, chimneys and all these smaller parts.
Neither have clouds and
trees and water and
the
like been neglected, nor have people and animals as
used
in
connection
with
building
representation.
Then
to round out the
subject we have opened a
large field
for exploration
in the recent chapters on
decorative drawing and on
uses
of
tinted
papers,
colored
pencils,
pencils
used
in
connection
with
other media,
etc.,
a
field in which the student may
wander
far,
constantly
finding new
pleasure
and
delight.
So with
all
this as a background we must leave
the reader to map out for himself the course which
it seems
best
for him
to pursue, and
this,
as we
have explained, depends wholly on his present stage
of
progress
and
his
individual
requirements.
Let
each man study himself and his needs.
If he lacks
the
ability
to
sketch
objects^in
correct proportion,
let him spend considerable time in drawing directly
from objects themselves, as described in Part
I, thus
giving
special attention
to
this
common
weakness.
In
fact, too much emphasis cannot be given to the
importance
of
such work,
especially
for the
archi-
tectural
student who
so often
lays out
his propor-
tions
instrumentally and
to
scale,
that
to do so by
the eye in a free-hand manner proves especially dif-
ficult.
Yet architectural students are sometimes
in-
clined to scoff at object drawing, being of the erro-
neous opinion that cubes and cylinders and books and
dishes have
little to do with architecture.
In
fact,
too
often
students
fail
to
see
that
it
is
fully as important to learn to do other kinds of free-
hand drawing as
it
is to do the kind directly applic-
able to their own work.
It
is especially valuable for
the architectural man who spends much of
his time
at instrumental drawing to vary his sketching prac-
tice by frequently choosing such subjects as will get
him
entirely away from the mechanical,
a
dilapi-
dated
barn
or
vine-covered
ruin,
for
instance,
or
anything of
this
sort which will serve as an aid
to
"loosening up"
from
the
"tight"
type
of drawing
which
is of necessity a part of his day's work.
He
should try such subjects as the bridge by Mr. Watson
on page
86,
or
the
old houses by Mr. Langmann,
page
167,
or even
less ambitious things where
the
subject
is
small and
few
straight
lines are
found.
In such work try to seek and record that which
is
really vital in a free and easy way, with
little atten-
tion to the technique
itself.
But whether one draws from the geometric forms
or
still
life or
cast
or
figure or some
architectural
subject, truth
is the thing to be sought, for a knowl-
edge of
truth
is the foundation
for
all the
rest.
So
in closing
let us
repeat,
then,
that each rrnn
should
study
his needs and straightway commence
to correct his
faults and ^overcome
his weaknesses,
seeking
instruction,
inviting
criticism,
comparing
results
with
drawings
by
others
and
so
striving
constantly for greater perfection, remembering that
one never reaches the point where
it
is not possible
for
him
to
advance
still
further,
and
let
it be
remembered,
too,
that
even
though
one
fails
to
acquire
exceptional
skill,
whatever
of
dexterity
is
gained
will always prove
a source of pleasure and
satisfaction.
