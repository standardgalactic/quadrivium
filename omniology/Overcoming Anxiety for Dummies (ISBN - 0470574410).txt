Introduction
T
he idea of a self-help book on anxiety in the For Dummies series germi-
nated in the summer of 2001. At the time, we wondered how the audi-
ence would react to a book with a title like Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies. 
Would potential readers feel turned off or insulted by the title? Would they 
think such a book would be condescending and “dummied down?”
A few people did respond negatively, and a couple of e-mails made us a tad 
anxious. Like most folks, we find that criticism stings. But we were surprised 
and gratified at the overwhelmingly positive responses we got from the 
majority of readers who contacted us.
People all over the world e-mailed us to say that they had found this book to 
be one of the most comprehensive and accessible books on anxiety they had 
ever read. Some told us that for the first time in their lives, anxiety no longer 
dominated their lives. We were also thrilled to discover that many counsel-
ors, therapists, and psychologists reported using the book as a supplement 
to psychotherapy sessions for their anxious patients.
When our editors approached us about updating Overcoming Anxiety For 
Dummies, we took some time to think about what had happened in the world 
since we wrote the first edition. As we reflected on this issue, we realized that 
the world has changed a lot in the nine years since the first edition appeared 
on bookshelves. We have more to worry about than ever. Because of these 
growing, emerging sources of worry, we felt a need to include information in 
this book that addresses them.
For example, some airport security areas now have equipment that takes a 
virtual naked picture of you as you enter. We’ve suffered through what’s cur-
rently called the Great Recession, and at the time of this writing, it’s unclear 
where the world economy is headed. People worry about getting jobs, keep-
ing jobs, and fragile dreams of retirement. The globalization of economies 
and travel have made the spread of pandemics faster and potentially more 
deadly than ever. Environmental worries have escalated; the viciousness of 
Mother Nature has frequently flashed across our computer and TV screens. 
The spread of nuclear weapons continues, and worries abound about war, 
crime, and terror. Children are frightened by stories about abuse and vio-
lence on the Internet and TV, while their worried parents increasingly restrict 
their lives.

2
Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
So today’s world gives us plenty to worry about, as it always has. But just as 
we don’t want to become victims of terror, we can’t let ourselves become vic-
tims of anxiety. Anxiety clouds our thinking and weakens our resolve to live 
life to the fullest. We realize that some anxiety is realistic and inescapable; 
yet, we can keep it from dominating our lives. Even under duress, we can pre-
serve a degree of serenity; we can hold onto our humanity, vigor, and zest for 
life. We can love and laugh.
Because we believe in our collective resilience, we take a humorous, and at 
times irreverent, approach to conquering anxiety. Our message is based on 
sound, scientifically proven methods. But we don’t bore you with the scien-
tific details. Instead, we present a clear, rapid-fire set of strategies for beating 
back anxiety and winning the war against worry.
About This Book
We have three goals in writing this book. First, we want you to understand 
just what anxiety is and the different forms it can take. Second, we think that 
knowing what’s good about anxiety and what’s bad about it is good for you. 
Finally, we cover what you’re probably most interested in — discovering the 
latest techniques for overcoming your anxiety and helping someone else who 
has anxiety.
Unlike most books, you don’t have to start on page 1 and read straight 
through. Use the extensive table of contents to pick and choose what you 
want to read. Don’t worry about reading parts in any particular order. For 
example, if you really don’t want much information about the who, what, 
when, where, and why of anxiety and whether you have it, go ahead and skip 
Part I. However, we encourage you to at least skim Part I, because it contains 
fascinating facts and information as well as ideas for getting started.
An Important Message to Our Readers
Since the first edition of Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies, we’ve made a 
point of commenting on our use of humor in these books. Although topics 
like anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and borderline per-
sonality disorder are serious, painful subjects, we believe that laughter, like a 
little sugar, helps the medicine go down and the message come through. We 
hope you agree.

3
 Introduction
This book is meant to be a guide to overcoming a mental state or disorder 
called anxiety. It should be used to give support and information to our 
readers. Everyone alive suffers from anxiety from time to time. However, 
if your anxiety greatly interferes with your day-to-day life, restricts your 
activities, and robs you of pleasure, we urge you to seek professional mental 
healthcare.
Conventions Used in This Book
We use a lot of case examples to illustrate our points throughout this book. 
Please realize that these examples represent composites of people with vari-
ous types of anxiety disorders. None of the examples is about real people 
we’ve seen or known. Any resemblance to a particular person is entirely coin-
cidental. We bold the names of people in our examples to indicate that a case 
example is starting.
Psychologists use lots of jargon and acronyms. We try our best to keep these 
to a minimum, but sometimes we can’t avoid them. When we do use a new 
term, we italicize and define it.
We also use boldface text to indicate keywords in a bulleted list or to high-
light action parts of numbered steps. Finally, when we direct you to a Web 
site for additional information, it’s printed in monofont.
What You’re Not to Read
Not only do you not have to read each and every chapter in order (or at all, 
for that matter), you don’t have to read each and every icon or sidebar (the 
text in the gray boxes). We try to give you plenty of current information and 
facts about anxiety. Some may not interest you — so don’t get too anxious 
about skipping around.
Foolish Assumptions
Who might pick up this book? We assume, probably foolishly, that you or 
someone you love suffers from some type of problem with anxiety or worry. 
But it’s also possible that you simply find the topic of anxiety interesting. 
We imagine that you may be curious about a variety of helpful strategies to 
choose from that can fit your lifestyle and personality. Finally, you may be a 
mental-health professional who’s interested in finding a friendly resource for 
your clients who suffer from anxiety or worry.

Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
How This Book Is Organized
Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies is organized into 6 parts and 23 chapters. 
Right now, we tell you a little about each part.
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety
In the first two chapters, you find out a great deal about anxiety — from 
who gets it to why people become anxious. We explain the different kinds of 
anxiety disorders — they’re not all the same — and we tell you who is most 
susceptible and why.
In Chapter 3, we review the biological aspects of anxiety disorders — from 
the toll they take on the body to the underlying biochemical processes 
involved.
Chapter 4 helps you clear the roadblocks to change. You discover the most 
common reasons that people resist working on their anxiety and what to do 
if you find yourself stuck.
Part II: Battling Anxiety
In Part II, we give you an array of proven, specific strategies for battling 
and overcoming anxiety. We show you strategies for transforming anxious 
thoughts into calm thoughts. And you discover how the words that you use 
can increase anxiety and how simply changing your vocabulary decreases 
anxiety.
One of the best ways to tackle anxiety is by taking action. No wimps here. We 
show you how to stare your fears in the face and conquer them. In addition, 
we take a look at how medication can sometimes alleviate anxiety disorders. 
We also review the most recent biological alternatives for reducing anxiety.
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle
These chapters take a look at ways of dealing with anxiety indirectly. 
Changes in lifestyle such as staying connected with others, exercising, get-
ting enough sleep, and maintaining a proper diet all help. Learning to relax 
through breathing exercises, muscle exercises, or conjuring up calm images 
can relieve anxiety passively.

5
 Introduction
Chapter 13 takes a mindful approach to managing anxiety. Mindfulness has 
emerged as a highly popular as well as empirically supported approach to 
improving emotional well-being.
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries
Part IV is a brand new part in this edition of Overcoming Anxiety For 
Dummies. The chapters in this part focus on anxieties about finances, ter-
rorism, natural disasters, and health. You can’t live a meaningful life without 
having some concern about issues such as these. This part gives you ways 
of preparing for unexpected calamities and ideas about how to accept uncer-
tainty in an uncertain world.
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety
What do you do when someone you love worries too much? First, we look at 
how you can help a significant adult in your life with anxiety. As a coach or 
simply a cheerleader, you can help your friend or family member conquer 
anxiety. In this new, expanded portion of the book, we also give you the tools 
to understand the differences between normal fear and anxiety in children. 
We also provide some simple guidelines to help out anxious kids. In addition, 
we talk about who to go to for help with your child and what to expect.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
If you’re looking for a quick fix or a simple review, take a look at these helpful 
lists. You can read about ten ways to stop anxiety in its tracks, ten ways to 
handle relapse, and ten signs that professional help is in order.
Finally, the appendix lists books and Web sites for obtaining more informa-
tion about the topics we cover in this book.
Icons Used in This Book
For Dummies books use little pictures, called icons, in the margins to get your 
attention. Here’s what they mean:

6
Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
The Anxiety Ax icon represents a particular action you can take to help get rid 
of anxiety.
 
The Remember icon appears when we want your attention. Please read the 
text associated with it for critical information.
 
The Tip icon alerts you to important insights or clarifications.
 
Warning icons appear when you need to be careful or seek professional help.
Where to Go from Here
Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies offers you the best, most up-to-date advice 
based on scientific research on anxiety disorders. If you want help control-
ling your negative thoughts, turn to Chapters 5, 6, and 7. You say you just 
want to relax? Try the techniques in Chapter 11. Or if you’re worried about 
your job and finances, in Chapter 14 we provide tips for finding your next job 
and pinching pennies. If you practice the techniques and strategies provided 
throughout, you’re likely to feel calmer. For many people, this book should 
be a complete guide to fighting frenzy and fear.
However, some stubborn forms of anxiety need more care and attention. If 
your anxiety and worry significantly get in the way of work or play, get help. 
Start with your family doctor to rule out physical causes. Then consult with a 
mental-health professional. Anxiety can be conquered; don’t give up.

Part I
Detecting and 
Exposing Anxiety

In this part . . .
W
e explore the ins and outs of anxiety, discussing 
the anxiety epidemic that’s going around and 
showing how anxiety affects the entire body. In this part, 
you can find all the major categories of anxiety disorders, 
along with an overview of what you can do to reduce anxi-
ety. You discover how you can easily get stuck tackling 
your anxiety, and we tell you how to keep that from 
happening.

Chapter 1
Analyzing and Attacking Anxiety
In This Chapter
▶ Growing by leaps and bounds: Anxiety’s proliferation
▶ Paying the tab for anxiety
▶ Understanding anxiety symptoms
▶ Getting the help you need
S
troll down the street and about one in four of the people you walk by 
either has an anxiety disorder or will at some point in their lives experi-
ence one. And almost half of the people you encounter will struggle with anxi-
ety to one degree or another, although they may not have a full-blown anxiety 
disorder. The rate of anxiety disorders has climbed for many decades, and 
no end is in sight.
The world watches in fear as disasters, terrorism, financial collapse, pandem-
ics, crime, and war threaten the security of home and family. Anxiety creates 
havoc in the home, destroys relationships, causes employees to lose time 
from work, and prevents people from living full, productive lives.
In this chapter, you find out how to recognize the symptoms of anxiety. We 
clarify the costs of anxiety — both personal and societal. We provide a brief 
overview of the treatments presented in greater detail in later chapters. You 
also get a glimpse of how to help if someone you care about or your child has 
anxiety. If you worry too much or care for someone who has serious prob-
lems with anxiety, this book is here to help!
Anxiety: Everybody’s Doing It
Anxiety involves feelings of uneasiness, worry, apprehension, and/or fear, 
and it’s the most common of all the so-called mental disorders. In other 
words, you definitely aren’t alone if you have unwanted anxiety. And the 
numbers have grown over the years. At no time in history has anxiety tor-
mented more people than it does today. Why?

10
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
Life has never been as complicated as it is today. The workweek has grown 
longer rather than shorter. Broken and blended families create increased 
stresses to manage. Computer screens and television news bring the latest 
horrors into your living room in real time. Newspapers, blogs, tweets, and 
magazines chronicle crime, war, and corruption. Terrorism has crossed the 
globe and escalated to new heights. The media’s portrayal of these modern 
plagues includes full-color images with unprecedented, graphic detail. Let’s 
face it, fear sells.
Unfortunately, as stressful and anxiety-arousing as the world is today, only 
a minority of those suffering from anxiety seek treatment. That’s a problem, 
because anxiety causes not only emotional pain and distress but also physi-
cal strain and even death, given that anxiety extracts a serious toll on the 
body and sometimes even contributes to suicide. Furthermore, anxiety costs 
society as a whole, to the tune of billions of dollars.
When people talk about what anxiety feels like, you may hear any or all of the 
following descriptions:
 
✓ When my panic attacks begin, I feel tightness in my chest. It’s as though 
I’m drowning or suffocating, and I begin to sweat; the fear is overwhelm-
ing. I feel like I’m going to die, and I have to sit down because I may faint.
 
✓ I’ve always been painfully shy. I want friends, but I’m too embarrassed to 
call anyone. I guess I feel like anyone I call will think I’m not worth talk-
ing to.
 
✓ I wake with worry every day, even on the weekends. Ever since I lost my 
job, I worry all the time. Sometimes, when it’s really bad, I think about 
going to sleep and never waking up.
 
✓ Ever since my accident, I have nightmares and constant images racing 
through my mind about glass breaking, tires screeching, and passengers 
screaming. I’m so jumpy and irritable that I can barely get through the day.
 
✓ I’m so afraid of flying that I can’t travel, even though I’d like to.
 
✓ I worry about germs and contamination so much that I wash my hands 
about 30 times a day — my hands are raw and bleeding. I just can’t stop.
As you can see, anxiety results in all sorts of thoughts, behaviors, and feel-
ings. When your anxiety begins to interfere with day-to-day life, you need to 
find ways to put your fears and worries at ease.
Tabulating the Costs of Anxiety
Anxiety costs. It costs the sufferer in emotional, physical, and financial terms. 
But it doesn’t stop there. Anxiety also incurs a financial burden for everyone. 
Stress, worry, and anxiety disrupt relationships, work, and family.

11
 Chapter 1: Analyzing and Attacking Anxiety
What does anxiety cost you?
Obviously, if you have a problem with anxiety, you experience the cost of dis-
tressed, anxious feelings. Anxiety feels lousy. You don’t need to read a book 
to know that. But did you know that untreated anxiety runs up a tab in other 
ways as well? These costs include
 
✓ A physical toll: Higher blood pressure, tension headaches, and gastro-
intestinal symptoms can affect your body. In fact, recent research found 
that certain types of chronic anxiety disorders change the makeup of 
your brain’s structures.
 
✓ A toll on your kids: Parents with anxiety more often have anxious chil-
dren. This is due in part to genetics, but it’s also because kids learn from 
observation. Anxious kids may be so stressed that they can’t pay atten-
tion in school.
 
✓ Fat!: Anxiety and stress increase the stress hormone known as cortisol. 
Cortisol causes fat storage in the abdominal area, thus increasing the 
risk of heart disease and stroke. Stress also leads to increased eating.
 
✓ More trips to the doctor: That’s because those with anxiety frequently 
experience worrisome physical symptoms. In addition, anxious people 
often worry a great deal about their health.
 
✓ Relationship problems: People with anxiety frequently feel irritable. 
Sometimes, they withdraw emotionally or do the opposite and depend-
ently cling to their partners.
 
✓ Downtime: Those with anxiety disorders miss work more often than 
other people, usually as an effort to temporarily quell their distress.
The heartbreak of anxiety
Two studies have found a critical relationship 
between anxiety and heart disease. One inves-
tigation at Duke University divided cardiac 
patients into three groups: an exercise group, a 
stress management group, and a care-as-usual 
group. After five years, the stress management 
group had fewer additional heart-related prob-
lems than the other two groups. Although this 
was a small study, one researcher concluded 
that managing stress and anxiety is one of the 
most powerful tools in fighting heart disease. 
The other study, published in the January 2002 
issue of the journal Stroke, found that men who 
suffer from anxiety and depression are much 
more likely to die from strokes than those with-
out these psychological problems.

12
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
Adding up the cost to society
Anxiety costs many billions of dollars worldwide. A U.S. government report 
says that anxiety costs more than depression, schizophrenia, or any other 
emotional problem. The annual tab is estimated at more than $65 billion. 
The United Kingdom spent 32 billion pounds (approximately $53 billion) on 
mental healthcare in 2002, a huge portion of which was spent on anxiety-
related problems. Even countries that spend little on mental healthcare incur 
substantial costs from anxiety disorders. These costs include
 
✓ Decreased productivity
 
✓ Healthcare costs
 
✓ Medications
Decreased productivity is sometimes due to health problems made worse by 
anxiety. But the financial loss from downtime and healthcare costs doesn’t 
include the dollars lost to substance abuse, which many of those with anxiety 
disorders turn to in order to deal with their anxiety. Thus, directly and indi-
rectly, anxiety extracts a colossal toll on both the person who experiences it 
and society at large.
Recognizing the Symptoms of Anxiety
You may not know if you suffer from anxiety or an anxiety disorder. That’s 
because anxiety involves a wide range of symptoms. Each person experi-
ences a slightly different constellation of these symptoms. And your specific 
constellation determines what kind of anxiety disorder you may have. We dis-
cuss the various types of anxiety disorders in detail in Chapter 2.
For now, you should know that some signs of anxiety appear in the form 
of thoughts or beliefs. Other indications of anxiety manifest themselves in 
bodily sensations. Still other symptoms show up in various kinds of anxious 
behaviors. Some people experience anxiety signs in all three ways, while 
others only perceive their anxiety in one or two areas.
Thinking anxiously
Folks with anxiety generally think in ways that differ from the ways that other 
people think. You’re probably thinking anxiously if you experience
 
✓ Approval addiction: If you’re an approval addict, you worry a great deal 
about what other people think about you.

13
 Chapter 1: Analyzing and Attacking Anxiety
 
✓ Living in the future and predicting the worst: When you do this, you think 
about everything that lies ahead and assume the worst possible outcome.
 
✓ Magnification: People who magnify the importance of negative events 
usually feel more anxious than other people do.
 
✓ Perfectionism: If you’re a perfectionist, you assume that any mistake 
means total failure.
 
✓ Poor concentration: Anxious people routinely report that they struggle 
with focusing their thoughts. Short-term memory sometimes suffers as well.
 
✓ Racing thoughts: Thoughts zip through your mind in a stream of almost 
uncontrollable worry and concern.
Name that phobia!
Phobias are one of the most common types of 
anxiety disorder, and we discuss them in detail 
in Chapter 2. A phobia is an excessive, dispro-
portionate fear of a relatively harmless situation 
or thing. Sometimes, the phobia poses some 
risk, but the person’s reaction clearly exceeds 
the danger. Do you know the technical names 
for phobias? Draw arrows from the common 
name of each phobia to the corresponding 
technical name. See how many you get right. 
The answers are printed upside down at the 
bottom.
Be careful if you have triskaidekaphobia (fear 
of the number 13), because we’re giving you 13 
phobias to match!

14
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
We discuss anxious thinking in great detail in Chapters 5, 6, and 7.
Behaving anxiously
We have three words to describe anxious behavior — avoidance, avoidance, 
and avoidance. Anxious people inevitably attempt to stay away from the 
things that make them anxious. Whether it’s snakes, heights, crowds, free-
ways, parties, paying bills, reminders of bad times, or public speaking, anx-
ious people search for ways out.
In the short run, avoidance lowers anxiety. It makes you feel a little better. 
However, in the long run, avoidance actually maintains and heightens anxi-
ety. We give you ways of dismantling avoidance in Chapter 8.
One of the most common and obvious examples of anxiety-induced avoid-
ance is how people react to their phobias. Have you ever seen the response 
of a spider phobic when confronting one of the critters? Usually, such folks 
hastily retreat.
Finding anxiety in your body
Almost all people with severe anxiety experience a range of physical effects. 
These sensations don’t simply occur in your head; they’re as real as this 
book you’re holding. The responses to anxiety vary considerably from 
person to person and include
 
✓ Accelerated heartbeat
 
✓ A spike in blood pressure
 
✓ Dizziness
 
✓ Fatigue
 
✓ Gastrointestinal upset
 
✓ General aches and pains
 
✓ Muscle tension or spasms
 
✓ Sweating
 
These are simply the temporary effects that anxiety exerts on your body. 
Chronic anxiety left untreated poses serious risks to your health as well. We 
discuss the general health effects in greater detail in Chapter 2.

15
 Chapter 1: Analyzing and Attacking Anxiety
Seeking Help for Your Anxiety
As we say earlier in this chapter, most people simply choose to live with 
anxiety rather than seek help. Some people worry that treatment won’t work. 
Or they believe that the only effective treatment out there is medication, and 
they hate the possibility of side effects. Others fret about the costs of getting 
help. And still others have concerns that tackling their anxiety would cause 
their fears to increase so much that they wouldn’t be able to stand it.
 
Well, stop adding worry to worry. You can significantly reduce your anxiety 
through a variety of interesting strategies. Many of these don’t have to cost 
a single cent. And if one doesn’t work, you can try another. Most people find 
that at least a couple of the approaches that we review work for them. The fol-
lowing sections provide an overview of treatment options and give you some 
guidance on what to do if your self-help efforts fall short.
 
Untreated anxiety may cause long-term health problems. It doesn’t make 
sense to avoid doing something about your anxiety.
Matching symptoms and therapies
Anxiety symptoms appear in three different spheres, as follows (see the ear-
lier section “Recognizing the Symptoms of Anxiety” for more details on these 
symptoms):
 
✓ Thinking symptoms: The thoughts that run through your mind
 
✓ Behaving symptoms: The things you do in response to anxiety
 
✓ Feeling symptoms: How your body reacts to anxiety
Treatment corresponds to each of these three areas, as we discuss in the fol-
lowing three sections.
Thinking therapies
One of the most effective treatments for a wide range of emotional problems, 
known as cognitive therapy, deals with the way you think about, perceive, and 
interpret everything that’s important to you, including
 
✓ Your views about yourself
 
✓ The events that happen to you in life
 
✓ Your future

16
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
 
When people feel unusually anxious and worried, they almost inevitably dis-
tort the way they think about these things. That distortion actually causes 
much of their anxiety. In the following example, Luann has both physical 
symptoms and cognitive symptoms of anxiety. Her therapist chooses a cogni-
tive approach to help her.
Luann, a junior in college, gets physically ill before every exam. She 
throws up, has diarrhea, and her heart races. She fantasizes that she will 
fail each and every test she takes and that eventually, the college will dis-
miss her. Yet, her lowest grade to date has been a B–.
The cognitive approach her therapist uses helps her capture the nega-
tive predictions and catastrophic outcomes that run through her mind. It 
then guides her to search for evidence about her true performance and a 
more realistic appraisal of the chances of her actually failing.
As simple as this approach sounds, hundreds of studies have found that it 
works well to reduce anxiety. Part II of this book describes various cognitive 
or thinking therapy techniques.
Ten dubious duds
This book is designed to give you ideas on how 
to beat anxiety. Beware the following things, 
which make anxiety worse:
 ✓ Avoidance: Avoiding what scares you 
makes anxiety worse. For example, if 
you’re afraid of driving on a freeway and 
only use side streets, your fear of driving 
on crowded, fast roads will get worse.
 ✓ Whining and complaining: People love to 
do this, but it only makes things worse.
 ✓ Seeking reassurance: When people give 
you reassurance, it feels good. But the 
effects are short-lived, and reassurance 
can actually make anxiety worse.
 ✓ Seeking quick fixes: The Internet is full of 
quick fixes, but we don’t know of any that 
have really been proven to work.
 ✓ Psychoanalysis: This approach to therapy 
works for some problems, but it hasn’t col-
lected much support in alleviating anxiety.
 ✓ Drinking or illegal drugs: Substances may 
relieve anxiety for a short while, but they 
actually increase anxiety in the long run.
 ✓ Trying too hard: If you push yourself too 
hard and feel anxious about your progress, 
you’re just going to make things worse. 
Slow down a little.
 ✓ Sipping herbal drinks: There’s nothing 
wrong with using these as a short-term 
crutch, but don’t count on them to cure your 
problem.
 ✓ Hoping for miracles: Hope is good — mira-
cles do happen — but it’s not a good idea to 
sit around and wait for one to come along.
 ✓ Taking medication as a sole solution: 
Some medications help some people with 
some anxiety problems, some of the time. 
But the strategies and therapies described 
in this book have proven to be more reliable 
and effective in the long run.

 Chapter 1: Analyzing and Attacking Anxiety
Behaving therapies
Another highly effective type of therapy is known as behavior therapy. As the 
name suggests, this approach deals with actions you can take and behav-
iors you can incorporate to alleviate your anxiety. Some actions are fairly 
straightforward, like getting more exercise and sleep and managing your 
responsibilities. You can get good ideas on those actions in Chapter 10.
On the other hand, one type of action that targets anxiety and can feel a little 
scary is exposure — breaking your fears down into small steps and facing 
them one at a time. We cover exposure in Chapter 8.
 
Some people, with the advice of their doctor, choose to take medications for 
their anxiety. If you’re considering that option, be sure to see Chapter 9 to 
help you make an informed decision.
Feeling therapies — soothing the inner storm
Anxiety sets off a storm of distressing physical symptoms, such as a racing 
heartbeat, upset stomach, muscle tension, sweating, dizziness, and so on. We 
have a variety of suggestions, including breathing and relaxation techniques, 
for helping quell this turmoil. You may choose to make changes in your life-
style (see Chapter 10), give the relaxation strategies we cover in Chapters 11 
and 12 a try, or employ mindfulness, an approach that teaches you to con-
nect with present moment experiences (see Chapter 13).
Choosing where to start
We organize this book so you can start anywhere you want, but you may 
wonder whether one set of strategies would work better for you than 
another. Although we can’t predict with certainty what will work best for 
you, we do have a guide for helping you choose the approach that may feel 
most compatible for your initial efforts. On the other hand, if you just want to 
read the book from front to back, that’s fine, too.
In the following anxiety quiz, check all the items that apply to you. If you 
check off more items in one category than the others, you may consider start-
ing with the part of this book that applies to it. For example, Chapters 5, 6, 
and 7 are designed especially for thinkers and present the thinking therapies, 
also known as cognitive therapy; Chapter 8 is aimed at doers and provides the 
essentials of behavior therapy. Part III focuses on feelers who may profit most 
by starting with strategies for quelling troubling bodily sensations and feel-
ings through relaxation, diet, exercise, meditation, better sleep habits, and 
mindfulness. If you check an equal number of items in two or more catego-
ries, ask yourself which one seems most like you and start there.

I hate sitting still with nothing to do.
Feelers (see Part III)
 
I am always aware of every discomfort in my body.
 
I hate the feeling of anxiety.
 
I love to immerse myself in the arts.
 
Music speaks to me.
 
I love the feeling of a massage or a hot bath.
Finding the right help
We suppose it’s not too presumptuous to assume that because you’re read-
ing this book, you or someone you know suffers from anxiety. And you’d 
probably like to tackle anxiety on your own. This is a self-help book, after all.
 
The good news is that self-help does work. A number of studies support the 
idea that people can deal with important, difficult problems without seeking 
the services of a professional. People clearly benefit from self-help. They get 
better and stay better.

19
 Chapter 1: Analyzing and Attacking Anxiety
Then again, sometimes self-help efforts fall short. Chapter 23 provides ten 
critical signs that indicate a likely need for professional help. See Chapter 4 
for information about finding the right professional for you.
If you do need professional consultation, many qualified therapists will work 
with you on the ideas contained in this book. That’s because most mental-
health professionals will appreciate the comprehensive nature of the material 
and the fact that most of the strategies are based on well-proven methods. If 
research has yet to support the value of a particular approach, we take care 
to let you know that. We happen to think you’re much better off sticking with 
strategies known to work and avoiding those that don’t.
In Chapters 18, 19, and 20, we discuss how to help a child or an adult loved 
one who has anxiety. If you’re working with a friend or family member, you 
both may want to read Part V, and possibly more, of this book. Sometimes, 
friends and family can help those who are also working with a professional 
and making their own efforts.
Whichever sources, techniques, or strategies you select, overcoming anxiety 
will be one of the most rewarding challenges that you ever undertake. The 
endeavor may scare you at first, and the going may start slow and have its 
ups and downs. But if you stick with it, we believe that you’ll find a way out of 
the quicksand of anxiety and onto the solid ground of serenity.

Chapter 2
Examining Anxiety: What’s 
Normal, What’s Not
In This Chapter
▶ Determining whether you have an anxiety disorder
▶ Looking at types of anxiety
▶ Uncovering anxiety copycats
A
nxious feelings sprout up for most folks here and there and are com-
pletely normal. In certain situations, anxiety is a perfectly understand-
able reaction. For example, if you’re driving in a snowstorm and your car 
starts to spin out of control, feeling anxious makes sense. But sometimes 
anxiety signals something more serious.
To get a feel for the difference between something as serious as an anxiety 
disorder and a normal reaction, read the following description and imagine 
ten minutes in the life of Tiffany.
Tiffany feels restless and shifts her weight from foot to foot. Walking 
forward a little, she notices a slight tightening in her chest. Her breathing 
quickens. She feels an odd mixture of excitement and mounting tension. 
She sits down and does her best to relax, but the anxiety continues to 
intensify. Her body suddenly jerks forward; she grips the sides of her seat 
and clenches her teeth to choke back a scream. Her stomach feels like it 
might come up through her throat. She feels her heart race and her face 
flush. Tiffany’s emotions run wild. Dizziness, fear, and a rushing sensation 
overtake her. The feelings all come in waves — one after the other.
You may wonder what’s wrong with poor Tiffany. Maybe she has an anxiety 
disorder. Or possibly she’s suffering a nervous breakdown. Perhaps she’s 
going crazy. No, Tiffany actually wanted to feel scared and anxious!

22
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
You see, she was at an amusement park. She handed her ticket to the atten-
dant and buckled herself into a roller coaster. After that, you probably under-
stand the rest of her experience. Tiffany doesn’t have an anxiety disorder, 
she isn’t suffering a nervous breakdown, and she isn’t going crazy. As her 
story illustrates, the symptoms of anxiety can be ordinary reactions to life.
In this chapter, we help you figure out whether you’re suffering from an anxi-
ety disorder, everyday anxiety, or something else. We take a close look at all 
the different forms and symptoms of anxiety. Then we discuss some of the 
other emotional disorders that often accompany anxiety.
Knowing When Anxiety Is a Help 
and When It’s a Hindrance
Imagine a life with no anxiety at all. How wonderful! You awaken every morn-
ing anticipating nothing but pleasant experiences. You fear nothing. The 
future holds only sweet security and joy.
Think again. With no anxiety, when the guy in the car in front of you slams 
on the brakes, your response will be slower and you’ll crash. With no wor-
ries about the future, your retirement may end up bleak. The total absence of 
anxiety may cause you to walk into a work presentation unprepared.
 
Anxiety is good for you! It prepares you to take action. It mobilizes your body 
for emergencies. It warns you about danger. Be glad you have some anxiety. 
Your anxiety helps you stay out of trouble.
 
Anxiety poses a problem for you when
 
✓ It lasts uncomfortably long or occurs too often. For example, if you 
have anxiety most days for more than a few weeks, you have reason for 
concern.
 
✓ It interferes with doing what you want to do. Thus, if anxiety wakes 
you up at night, causes you to make mistakes at work, or keeps you from 
going where you want to go, it’s getting in the way.
 
✓ It exceeds the level of actual danger or risk. For example, if your body 
and mind feel like an avalanche is about to bury you but all you’re doing 
is taking a test for school, your anxiety has gone too far.
 
✓ You struggle to control your worries, but they keep on coming. 
Regardless of what you do, anxious thoughts pop up over and over.

23
 Chapter 2: Examining Anxiety: What’s Normal, What’s Not
Presenting the Seven Types of Anxiety
Anxiety comes in various forms. The word “anxious” is a derivative of the 
Latin word angere, meaning to strangle or choke. A sense of choking or tight-
ening in the throat or chest is a common symptom of anxiety. However, anxi-
ety also involves other symptoms, such as sweating, trembling, nausea, and a 
racing heartbeat. Anxiety may also involve fears — fear of losing control and 
fear of illness or dying. In addition, people with excessive anxiety avoid vari-
ous situations, people, animals, or objects to an unnecessary degree.
Psychologists and psychiatrists have compiled a list of seven major catego-
ries of anxiety disorders as follows:
 
✓ Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)
 
✓ Social phobia
 
✓ Panic disorder
 
✓ Agoraphobia
 
✓ Specific phobias
 
✓ Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
 
✓ Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
 
You don’t need a full-blown diagnosis to feel that you have some trouble with 
anxiety. Many people have more anxiety than they want but don’t completely 
fit the category of having an official anxiety disorder.
 
Only a mental-health professional can tell you for certain what type of anxiety 
you have, because various other disorders can look similar.
Generalized anxiety disorder: 
The common cold of anxiety
Some people refer to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) as the common cold 
of anxiety disorders because it afflicts more people throughout the world 
than any other anxiety disorder. GAD involves a long-lasting, almost constant 
state of tension and worry. Realistic worries don’t mean you have GAD. For 
example, if you worry about money and you’ve just lost your job, that’s not 
GAD; it’s a real-life problem. But if you constantly worry about money and 
your name is Bill Gates or Warren Buffet, you just may have GAD!
 
You may have GAD if your anxiety has shown up almost every day for the last 
six months. You try to stop worrying but you just can’t, and you frequently 
experience a number of the following problems:

24
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
 
✓ You feel restless, often irritable, on edge, fidgety, or keyed up.
 
✓ You get tired easily.
 
✓ Your muscles feel tense, especially in your back, neck, or shoulders.
 
✓ You have difficulty concentrating, falling asleep, or staying asleep.
Not everyone experiences anxiety in exactly the same way. Some people 
complain about other problems — such as twitching, trembling, shortness 
of breath, sweating, dry mouth, stomach upset, feeling shaky, being easily 
startled, and having difficulty swallowing — and fail to realize that they actu-
ally suffer from GAD.
The following profile offers an example of what GAD is all about.
In a subway, Brian taps his foot nervously. He slept only a few hours last 
night, tossing, turning, and ruminating about the economy. He’s sure that 
he’s next in line to lose his job. Even though his boss says that he’s safe, 
Brian can’t stop worrying. He believes that he may end up broke and 
homeless.
His back is killing him; he shrugs his shoulders trying to loosen up his 
tight muscles. He struggles to concentrate on the blog that he’s looking 
at and realizes that he can’t remember what he just read. He notices his 
shirt feels damp. He thinks he might be sick. He is sick — with worry.
Brian has worked steadily at the same company since graduating from 
college six years ago. His work is highly technical. Most of the senior 
executives depend on his technology know-how. He has stashed away 
a nice amount of money for emergencies. Nevertheless, his anxiety has 
increased over the last year to the point that he notices that he’s making 
mistakes. He can’t think; he feels horrible and is in a constant state of dis-
tress. Brian suffers from GAD.
The economy can make anyone anxious at times. But Brian’s worries seem 
out of proportion to his real situation. It seems unlikely that he’s in danger 
of losing his job. However, his extreme anxiety may, in fact, cause him to get 
in trouble at work. People with overwhelming anxiety often make careless 
mistakes because of problems with attention and concentration. GAD takes 
everyday worries and turns up the volume to full blast.
Social phobia: Avoiding people
Those with social phobia fear exposure to public scrutiny. They frequently 
dread performing, speaking, going to parties, meeting new people, enter-
ing groups, using the telephone, writing a check in front of others, eating in 
public, and/or interacting with those in authority. They see these situations 
as painful because they expect to receive humiliating or shameful judgments 

25
 Chapter 2: Examining Anxiety: What’s Normal, What’s Not
from others. Social phobics believe they’re somehow defective and inad-
equate; they assume they’ll bungle their lines, spill their drinks, shake hands 
with clammy palms, or commit any number of social faux pas and thus embar-
rass themselves. They also worry about what others are thinking about 
them — so much that they don’t listen well enough to keep a conversation 
going.
 
Everyone feels uncomfortable or nervous from time to time, especially in new 
situations. For example, if you’ve been experiencing social fears for less than 
six months, you may not have social phobia. A short-term fear of socializing 
may be a temporary reaction to a new stress such as moving to a new neigh-
borhood or getting a new job. However, you may have social phobia if you 
experience the following symptoms for a prolonged period:
 
✓ You fear situations with unfamiliar people or ones where you may be 
observed or evaluated in some way.
 
✓ When forced into an uncomfortable social situation, your anxiety 
increases powerfully. For example, if you fear public speaking, your 
voice shakes and your knees tremble the moment that you start your 
speech.
 
✓ You realize that your fear is greater than the situation really warrants. 
For example, if you fear meeting new people, logically you know nothing 
horrible will happen, but tidal waves of adrenaline and fearful anticipa-
tion course through your veins.
 
✓ You avoid fearful situations as much as you can or endure them only 
with great distress.
Check out the following prime example of a social phobic and see whether 
any of it seems familiar.
Quinton, a 35-year-old bachelor, wants a serious relationship. Women 
consider him attractive and he has a high-paying job. Quinton’s friends 
invite him to parties and other social events in an effort to set him up 
with women. Unfortunately, he detests the idea of going. Quinton con-
jures up a number of good excuses for backing out. However, his desire 
to meet potential dates eventually wins. Whenever he imagines scenes of 
meeting women, he feels intense, anxious anticipation.
When Quinton arrives at the party, he heads to the bar to quell his 
mounting anxiety. His hands shake as he picks up his first drink. Quickly 
downing the drink, he orders another in hopes of numbing his emotions. 
After an hour of nonstop drinking, he feels much braver. He interrupts 
a cluster of attractive women and spews out a string of jokes that he 
has memorized for the occasion. Then he approaches various women 
throughout the night, sometimes making flirtatious, suggestive com-
ments. His silly, drunken behavior doesn’t get him any dates. The follow-
ing day, he’s embarrassed and ashamed.

26
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
Quinton has social phobia. Drug and alcohol abuse often accompany social 
phobia because people with social phobia feel desperate to quell their anx-
ious feelings. And drugs and alcohol offer a quick fix. Unfortunately, that fix 
often turns into an addiction.
Panic disorder: Way beyond 
everyday anxiety
Of course, everyone feels a little panicked from time to time. People often say 
they feel panicked about an upcoming deadline, an impending presentation, 
or planning for a party. You’re likely to hear the term used to describe con-
cerns about rather mundane events such as these.
But people who suffer with panic disorder are talking about entirely differ-
ent phenomena. They have periods of stunningly intense fear and anxiety. 
If you’ve never had a panic attack, trust us, you don’t want one. The attacks 
usually last about ten minutes, and many people who have them fully believe 
that they will die during the attack. Not exactly the best ten minutes of their 
lives. Panic attacks normally include a range of robust, attention-grabbing 
symptoms, such as
 
✓ An irregular, rapid, or pounding heartbeat
 
✓ Perspiring
 
✓ A sense of choking, suffocation, or shortness of breath
 
✓ Vertigo or lightheadedness
 
✓ Pain or other discomfort in the chest
 
✓ A feeling that events are unreal or a sense of detachment
 
✓ Numbness or tingling
 
✓ Hot or cold flashes
 
✓ A fear of impending death, though without basis in fact
 
✓ Stomach nausea or upset
 
✓ Thoughts of going insane or completely losing control
Panic attacks begin with an event that triggers some kind of sensation, such 
as physical exertion or normal variations in physiological reactions. This 
triggering event induces physiological responses, such as increased levels of 
adrenaline. No problem so far.
But the otherwise normal process goes awry at the next step — when the 
person who suffers from panic attacks misinterprets the meaning of the physi-
cal symptoms. Rather than viewing the physical symptoms as normal, the 
person with panic disorder sees them as a signal that something dangerous is 

27
 Chapter 2: Examining Anxiety: What’s Normal, What’s Not
happening, such as a heart attack or stroke. That interpretation causes esca-
lating fear and thus more physical arousal. Fortunately, the body can sustain 
such heightened physical responses only for a while, so it eventually calms 
down.
 
Professionals say that in order to have full-blown panic disorder, panic attacks 
must occur more than once. People with panic disorder worry about when the 
next panic attack will come and whether they’ll lose control. They often start 
changing their lives by avoiding certain places or activities.
The good news: Many people have a single panic attack and never have 
another one. So don’t panic if you have a panic attack. Maria’s story is a good 
example of a one-time panic attack.
Maria resolves to lose 20 pounds by exercising and watching what she 
eats. On her third visit to the gym, she sets the treadmill to a level six. 
Almost immediately, her heart rate accelerates. Alarmed, she decreases 
the level to three. She starts taking rapid, shallow breaths but feels she 
can’t get enough air. Sweating profusely and feeling nauseous, she stops 
the machine and staggers to the locker room. She sits down; the symp-
toms intensify and her chest tightens. She wants to scream but can’t get 
enough air. She’s sure that she’ll pass out and hopes someone will find 
her before she dies of a heart attack. She hears someone and weakly calls 
for help. An ambulance whisks her to a nearby emergency room.
At the ER, Maria’s symptoms subside, and the doctor explains the results 
of her examination. He says that she has apparently experienced a panic 
attack and inquires about what may have set it off. She answers that she 
was exercising because of concerns about her weight and health.
“Ah, that explains it,” the doctor reassures. “Your concerns about health 
made you hypersensitive to any bodily symptom. When your heart rate 
naturally increased on the treadmill, you became alarmed. That fear 
caused your body to produce more adrenaline, which in turn created 
more symptoms. The more symptoms you had, the more your fear and 
adrenaline increased. Knowing how this works may help you; hopefully, 
in the future, your body’s normal physical variations won’t frighten you. 
Your heart’s in great shape. Go back to exercising.
“Also, you might try some simple relaxation techniques; I’ll have the 
nurse come in and tell you about those. I have every reason to believe 
that you won’t have another episode like this one. Finally, you may want 
to read Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies by Drs. Charles Elliott and 
Laura Smith (Wiley); it’s a great book!”
Maria doesn’t have a diagnosis of panic disorder because she hasn’t experi-
enced more than one attack, and she may never have an attack again. If she 
believes the doctor and takes his advice, the next time her heart races, she 
probably won’t get so scared. She may even use the relaxation techniques 
that the nurse explained to her.

Agoraphobia: Panic’s companion
Approximately half of those who suffer from a panic disorder have an accom-
panying problem: agoraphobia. Unlike most fears or phobias, this strange 
disorder usually begins in adulthood. Individuals with agoraphobia live in 
terror of being trapped. In addition, they worry about having a panic attack, 
throwing up, or having diarrhea in public. They desperately avoid situations 
from which they can’t readily escape, and they also fear places where help 
may not be readily forthcoming should they need it.
The agoraphobic may start with one fear, such as being in a crowd, but in 
many cases the feared situations multiply to the point that the person fears 
even leaving home. As agoraphobia teams up with panic, the double-barreled 
fears of not getting help and of feeling entombed with no way out can lead to 
paralyzing isolation.
You or someone you love may have agoraphobia if
 
✓ You worry about being somewhere where you can’t get out or can’t get 
help in case something bad happens, like a panic attack.
 
✓ You tremble over everyday things like leaving home, being in large 
groups of people, or traveling.
 
✓ Because of your anxiety, you avoid the places that you fear so much that 
it takes over your life, and you become a prisoner of your fear.
 
You may have concerns about feeling trapped or have anxiety about crowds 
and leaving home. Many people do. But if your life goes on without major 
changes or constraints, you’re probably not agoraphobic.
Help! I’m dying!
Panic attack symptoms, such as chest pain, 
shortness of breath, nausea, and intense fear, 
often mimic heart attacks. Alarmed, those who 
experience these terrifying episodes take off in 
the direction of the nearest emergency room. 
Then, after numerous tests come back nega-
tive, overworked doctors tell the victim of a 
panic attack in so many words that “It’s all in 
your head.” Many patients with panic attacks 
doubt the judgment of the physician and 
strongly suspect that something important was 
missed or wasn’t found.
The next time an attack occurs, panic attack 
victims are likely to return to the ER for another 
opinion again and again. The repeat visits frus-
trate people with panic attacks as well as ER 
staff. However, a simple 20- or 30-minute psy-
chological intervention in the emergency room 
decreases the repeat visits dramatically. The 
intervention is pretty simple — just providing 
education about what the disorder is all about 
and describing a few deep relaxation tech-
niques to try when panic hits.

 Chapter 2: Examining Anxiety: What’s Normal, What’s Not
For example, imagine that you quake at the thought of entering large sports 
stadiums. You see images of crowds pushing and shoving, causing you to fall 
over the railing, landing below, only to be trampled by the mob as you cry 
out. You may be able to live an entire blissful life avoiding sports stadiums. 
On the other hand, if you love watching live sports events, or you just got a 
job as a sports reporter, this fear could be really bad.
Patricia’s story, which follows, demonstrates the overwhelming anxiety that 
often traps agoraphobics.
Patricia celebrates her 40th birthday without having experienced signifi-
cant emotional problems. She has gone through the usual bumps in the 
road of life like losing a parent, her child having a learning disability, and 
a divorce ten years earlier. She prides herself in coping with whatever 
cards life deals her.
Lately, she feels stressed when shopping at the mall on weekends 
because of the crowds. She finds a parking spot at the end of a row. As 
she enters the mall, her sweaty hands leave a smudge on the revolving 
glass door. She feels as though the crowd of shoppers is crushing in on 
her, and she feels trapped. She’s so scared that she flees the store.
Over the next few months, her fears spread. Although they started at the 
mall, fear and anxiety now overwhelm her in crowded grocery stores as 
well. Later, simply driving in traffic scares her. Patricia suffers from ago-
raphobia. If not treated, Patricia could end up housebound.
Many times, panic, agoraphobia, and anxiety strike people who are otherwise 
devoid of serious, deep-seated emotional problems. So if you suffer from 
anxiety, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need years of psychotherapy. You 
may not like the anxiety, but you don’t have to think you’re nuts!
Specific phobias: Spiders, snakes, 
airplanes, and other scary things
Many fears appear to be hard-wired into the human brain. Cave men and 
women had good reasons to fear snakes, strangers, heights, darkness, open 
spaces, and the sight of blood — snakes could be poisonous, strangers 
could be enemies, a person could fall from a height, darkness could harbor 
unknown hazards, open spaces could leave a primitive tribe vulnerable to 
attack from all sides, and the sight of blood could signal a crisis, even poten-
tial death. Fear fuels caution and avoidance of harm. Those with these fears 
had a better chance of survival than the naively brave.
That’s why many of the most common fears today reflect the dangers of 
the world thousands of years ago. Even today, it makes sense to cautiously 
identify a spider before you pick it up. However, sometimes fears rise to a 
disabling level. You may have a specific phobia if

30
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
 
✓ You have an exaggerated fear of a specific situation or object.
 
✓ When you’re in a fearful situation, you experience excessive anxiety 
immediately. Your anxiety may include sweating, rapid heartbeat, a 
desire to flee, tightness in the chest or throat, or images of something 
awful happening.
 
✓ You know the fear is unreasonable. However, kids with specific phobias 
don’t always know that their phobia is unreasonable. For example, they 
may really think that all dogs bite. (See Chapter 19 for more on specific 
phobias in children.)
 
✓ You avoid your feared object or situation as much as you possibly can.
 
✓ Because your fear is so intense, you go so far as to change your day-
to-day behavior at work, at home, or in relationships. Thus, your fear 
inconveniences you and perhaps others, and it restricts your life.
 
Almost two thirds of people fear one thing or another. For the most part, 
those fears don’t significantly interfere with everyday life. For example, if you 
fear snakes but don’t run into too many snakes, then your fear can’t really be 
considered a phobia. However, if your snake fear makes it impossible for you 
to walk around in your neighborhood, go on a picnic, or enjoy other activities, 
then it may be a specific phobia.
The following description of Ted’s life is a prime picture of what someone 
with a specific phobia goes through.
Ted trudges up eight flights of stairs each morning to get to his office and 
tells everyone that he loves the exercise. When Ted passes the eleva-
tors on the way to the stairwell, his heart pounds, and he feels a sense of 
doom. Ted envisions being boxed inside the elevator — the doors slide 
shut, and there’s no escape. In his mind, the elevator box rises on rusty 
cables, makes sudden jerks up and down, falls freely, and crashes into 
the basement.
Ted has never experienced anything like his fantasy, nor has anyone he 
knows had this experience. Ted has never liked elevators, but he didn’t 
start avoiding them until the past few years. It seems that the longer he 
stays away from riding them, the stronger his fear grows. He used to 
feel okay on escalators, but now he finds himself avoiding those as well. 
Several weeks ago at the airport, he had no alternative but to take the 
escalator. He managed to get on but became so frightened that he had to 
sit down for a while after he reached the second floor.
One afternoon, Ted rushed down the stairs after work, running late for 
an appointment. He slipped and fell, breaking his leg. Now in a cast, Ted 
faces the challenge of his life — with a broken leg, he now must take the 
elevator to get to his office. Ted has a specific phobia.
Ted’s story illustrates how a specific phobia often starts out small and spreads. 
Such phobias gradually grow and affect one’s life increasingly over time.

Post-traumatic stress disorder: 
Feeling the aftermath
Tragically, war, rape, terror, crashes, brutality, torture, and natural disasters 
are a part of life. You or someone you know may have experienced one of 
life’s traumas. No one knows why for sure, but some people seem to recover 
from these events without disabling symptoms. However, many others suffer 
considerably after their tragedy, sometimes for a lifetime. Post-traumatic stress 
disorder (PTSD) sometimes results from such shocks.
More often than not, trauma causes at least a few uncomfortable emotional 
and/or physical reactions for a while. These responses can show up imme-
diately after the disaster, or, sometimes, they emerge years later. These 
symptoms are the way that the body and mind deal with and process what 
happened. If an extremely unfortunate event occurs, it’s normal to react 
strongly.
You may have PTSD if you experience or witness an event that you perceive 
as potentially life-threatening or causing serious injury and you feel terror, 
horror, or helplessness. In order to have a diagnosis of PTSD, three types of 
problems must also occur:
 
✓ You relive the event in one or more ways:
 
• Having unwanted memories or flashbacks during the day or in 
your dreams
 
• Feeling the trauma is happening again
 
• Experiencing physical or emotional reactions when reminded of 
the event
Top ten fears

about what people fear most. The following list 
is our compilation of the most common fears. 
Do you have any of these?
10. Dogs
9. Being alone at night
8. Thunder and lightning
7. Spiders and insects
6. Being trapped in a small space

4. Rodents
3. Heights
2. Giving a speech
And finally, the number-one fear: Snakes

✓ You avoid anything that reminds you of the trauma and try to sup-
press or numb your feelings in several ways:
 
• Trying to block out thinking or talking about the event because 
you get upset when you remember what happened
 
• Staying away from people or places that remind you of the trauma
 
• Losing interest in life or feeling distant from people
 
• Sensing somehow that you don’t have a long future
 
• Feeling numb or detached
 
✓ You feel on guard and stirred up in several ways:
 
• Becoming startled more easily
 
• Losing your temper quickly and feeling irritable
 
• Feeling unable to concentrate as well as before
 
• Sleeping poorly
 
The diagnosis of PTSD is complicated. If you suspect that you may have it, 
you should seek professional help. On the other hand, you may realize that 
you have a few of these symptoms but not the full diagnosis. If so, and if your 
problem feels mild and doesn’t interfere with your life, you may want to try 
working on the difficulty on your own for a while. But seek help if you don’t 
feel better soon.
The following example of Wayne illustrates what living with PTSD is like. 
Wayne struggles daily with his demons.
Wayne was late for work. He started the long trek from his car to his 
office at the Pentagon, and he heard the loud engine of an airplane just 
overhead. He was shocked to see how low the plane was flying. The 
next thing he knew, he was thrown to the ground by a loud explosion 
and a burst of wind. He remembers people streaming out of the build-
ing screaming and crying, some injured. Wayne can’t recall many of the 
details of that day. He was told that his late arrival certainly saved his 
life. Many friends and co-workers weren’t so lucky.
Wayne believes he should be more grateful. Physically he was banged 
up a little. But his emotional injuries were extensive. Wayne has trouble 
sleeping. He tries to block the memories of that horrible day, but they 
seem to flood his brain. He can’t concentrate, and he feels like he’s in 
another world detached from others. He can’t face going to work and 
takes an early retirement.

33
 Chapter 2: Examining Anxiety: What’s Normal, What’s Not
Wayne has PTSD. Like many others with the disorder, he witnessed a hor-
rible event that his mind doesn’t know how to cope with. Many veterans 
returning from active duty suffer from PTSD. Treatment can be very effective. 
See Chapter 8 for strategies.
Obsessive-compulsive disorder: 
Over and over and over again
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) wreaks incredible havoc on people’s 
lives because OCD frustrates and confuses not only the people afflicted with 
it but their families and loved ones as well. If untreated, it’s likely to last a 
lifetime. Even with treatment, symptoms often recur. That’s the bad news. 
Thankfully, highly effective treatments are available. For much more informa-
tion, read our book Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder For Dummies (Wiley).
Distinguishing between obsessions and compulsions
A person with OCD may exhibit behaviors that include an obsession, 
a compulsion, or both. So what’s the difference between obsessions and 
compulsions?
Obsessions are unwelcome, disturbing, and repetitive images, impulses, or 
thoughts that jump into the mind. For example, a religious man may have a 
thought urging him to shout obscenities during a church service, or a caring 
mother may have intrusive thoughts of causing harm to her baby. Thankfully, 
people with OCD don’t carry out these kinds of thoughts, but the obsessions 
haunt those who have them. Most people who have OCD know that their 
obsessions are not entirely realistic but can’t seem to stop believing them.
Compulsions are repetitive actions or mental strategies carried out to tem-
porarily reduce anxiety or distress. Sometimes, an obsessive thought causes 
the anxiety; at other times, the anxiety relates to some feared event or situa-
tion that triggers the compulsion.
For example, a woman may wash her hands literally hundreds of times each 
day in order to reduce her anxiety about germs, or a man may have an elabo-
rate nighttime ritual of touching certain objects, lining up clothes in a specific 
way, arranging his wallet next to his keys in a special position, stacking his 
change, getting into bed in precisely the correct manner, and reading one 
section of the Bible before turning out the light. And if he performs any part 
of the ritual in less than the “perfect” way, he feels compelled to start all over 
until he gets it right. Otherwise, he worries that he won’t be able to sleep and 
that something bad may happen to those he cares about.

Table 2-1 presents some common obsessions and compulsions experienced 
by those with OCD.

Worries about death, bad luck, and 
catastrophes
Avoiding certain numbers, words, and 
places associated with death and bad 
luck
Worries that everything must be “just so”
Arranging items in particular patterns, 
alphabetically, or in some symmetrical 
order
Seeing OCD when it isn’t there
You may recall walking to school with your friends and avoiding cracks in the 
sidewalk. If you stepped on one, perhaps someone chided, “If you step on a 
crack, you’ll break your mother’s back!” And sometimes you walked to school 
by yourself and that same thought occurred to you, so you avoided stepping 
on the cracks. Obviously, you knew that stepping on a crack wouldn’t break 
your mother’s back. So not stepping on cracks almost qualifies as a compul-
sion. That’s because you may have done it repeatedly while knowing that it 
wouldn’t stop anything bad from happening. If you did it simply as a game 
and it didn’t bother you that much, avoiding cracks was no big deal, and it 
wasn’t OCD. Besides, kids often have magical or superstitious thinking, which 
they usually outgrow.
On the other hand, if some part of you really worried that your mother might 
suffer if you stepped on a crack and if you sometimes couldn’t even get to 
school because of your worry, you probably had a full-blown compulsion. 
Many people check the locks more than once, go back to make sure the 
coffeepot is turned off a couple of extra times, or count stairs or steps unnec-
essarily. It’s only when doing these things starts taking too much time and 
interferes with relationships, work, or everyday life that you really have a 
problem.

 Chapter 2: Examining Anxiety: What’s Normal, What’s Not
Lisa’s story depicts someone with OCD who worries about contamination. 
Like many people with OCD, her fears have some chance of coming true, but 
she greatly exaggerates the risks.
Lisa likes a neat and clean home. In college, she ended up staying in a 
single dorm room because she couldn’t stand the mess of other students. 
Now, married and with a new baby, Lisa spends hours cleaning and 
straightening the house. Her husband doesn’t seem to mind. He works 
very long hours and likes coming home to a neat house and a hot meal.
Lisa’s television is usually on during the day while she cleans and tends 
to the baby. She first hears about a possible flu outbreak on cable news. 
The death of a toddler in a nearby state frightens her, and she begins 
obsessing about a worldwide pandemic. She believes that by sanitizing 
her house, she will keep the virus from infecting her family. Lisa orders 
her groceries and cleaning supplies over the Internet so that she can 
avoid leaving the house, fearing contamination. She now spends most of 
the day cleaning except when she is feeding the baby. Her husband, start-
ing to get concerned, asks her if maybe she’s becoming a bit too uptight 
about germs.
Like many people with OCD, Lisa’s fear of germs starts off with a normal ten-
dency to be clean and neat. However, OCD takes over her life when she can’t 
seem to clean enough and constantly worries about getting the flu.
Seeing How Anxiety Differs 
from Other Disorders
Anxious symptoms sometimes travel with other company. Thus, you may 
have anxiety along with other emotional disorders. In fact, about half of those 
with anxiety disorders develop depression, especially if their anxiety goes 
untreated. Recognizing the difference between anxiety and other emotional 
problems is important because the treatments differ somewhat.
 
✓ Depression: Depression can feel like life in slow motion. You lose inter-
est in activities that used to bring you pleasure. You feel sad. Most 
likely, you feel tired, and you sleep fitfully. Your appetite may wane, and 
your sex drive may droop. Similar to anxiety, you may find it difficult 
to concentrate or plan ahead. But unlike anxiety, depression saps your 
drive and motivation. For more information, see our book Depression For 
Dummies (Wiley).
 
✓ Bipolar disorder: If you have bipolar disorder, you seesaw between 
ups and downs. At times, you feel that you’re on top of the world. You 
believe your ideas are unusually important and need little sleep for days 
at a time. You may feel more special than other people. You may invest 

36
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
in risky schemes, shop recklessly, engage in sexual escapades, or lose 
your good judgment in other ways. You may start working frantically 
on important projects or find ideas streaming through your mind. Then 
suddenly you crash and burn. Your mood turns sour and depression 
sets in. (Check out Bipolar Disorder For Dummies by Candida Fink, MD, 
and Joe Kraynak [Wiley] for more about this disorder.)
 
✓ Psychosis: Not only may psychosis make you feel anxious, but the 
symptoms also profoundly disrupt your life. Psychosis weaves hallucina-
tions into everyday life. For example, some people hear voices talking to 
them or see shadowy figures when no one is around. Delusions, another 
feature of psychosis, also distort reality. Common psychotic delusions 
include believing that the CIA or aliens are tracking your whereabouts. 
Other delusions involve grandiose, exaggerated beliefs, such as thinking 
you’re Jesus Christ or that you have a special mission to save the world.
 
 
If you think you hear the phone ringing when you’re drying your hair 
or in the shower, only to discover that it wasn’t, you’re not psychotic. 
Most people occasionally hear or see trivial things that aren’t there. 
Psychosis becomes a concern only when these perceptions seriously 
depart from reality. Fortunately, anxiety disorders don’t lead to 
psychosis.
 
✓ Substance abuse: When people develop a dependency on drugs or 
alcohol, withdrawal may create serious anxiety. The symptoms of drug 
or alcohol withdrawal include tremors, disrupted sleep, sweating, 
increased heartbeat, agitation, and tension. However, if these symptoms 
only come on in response to a recent cessation of substance use, they 
don’t constitute an anxiety disorder.
 
Those with anxiety disorders sometimes abuse substances in a misguided 
attempt to control their anxiety. If you think you have an anxiety disorder, 
be very careful about your use of drugs or alcohol. Talk to your doctor if you 
have concerns.

▶ Exploring what anxiety does to the body
▶ Uncovering anxiety imposters
M
ost people with anxiety describe uncomfortable physical symptoms 
that go along with their worries. They may experience heart palpita-
tions, nausea, dizziness, sweats, or muscle tension. Those symptoms are evi-
dence that anxiety is truly a disorder of both the mind and the body.
In this chapter, we review some of the biological roots of anxiety, as well as 
the consequences of chronic stress on health. Then we tell you about medi-
cations or food that can actually make you feel anxious. Finally, we discuss 
how some illnesses can cause or mimic anxiety.
Examining the Anxious Brain
The brain takes in information about the world through sight, taste, smell, 
sound, and touch. Constantly scanning the world for meaning, the brain inte-
grates information from the past with the present and plans what actions to 
take. For most people, most of the time, the brain does a pretty good job. But 
for those with chronic anxiety, something goes awry.
Billions of nerve cells (neurons) reside in the brain. They’re organized into a 
variety of complex structures or circuits. Some of these structures are partic-
ularly involved in producing feelings of anxiety, fear, and stress. These brain 
structures communicate with one another by sending chemical messengers, 
known as neurotransmitters, back and forth among them.

38
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
In the following sections, we explain how the brain interprets information 
and what role the brain’s chemicals play in making you anxious.
Seeing how the brain’s circuits 
are connected
Think of the brain as having many interconnected circuits. One circuit 
involves the limbic system and the frontal lobes. The limbic system (particu-
larly the amygdala) registers danger and threats and gives rise to reflexive 
fear responses. The frontal lobes use thought and reason to process incom-
ing information. For example, the limbic system could set off alarms reflex-
ively upon seeing a snake. However, the frontal lobes may signal the system 
to calm down as it processes the fact that the snake is in a glass cage.
In anxiety disorders, either the limbic system or the frontal lobes (or both) 
may fail to function properly. Thus, the limbic system may trigger fear 
responses too easily and too often, or the frontal lobes may fail to use logic 
to quell the fears set off by the limbic system. When the brain signals danger, 
the body responds by getting ready for action. The next section explains the 
chemical aspects of fear.
Communicating chemicals
Neurotransmitters help nerve cells communicate feelings, fears, emotions, 
thoughts, and actions through an intricate orchestration. Four major neu-
rotransmitter systems and some of their functions include
 
✓ The noradrenergic system, which produces norepinephrine and 
epinephrine. It also stimulates organs required in the fight-or-flight 
response (see the following section).
 
✓ The cholinergic system, which activates the noradrenergic neurotrans-
mitters and facilitates formation of memories.
 
✓ The dopaminergic system, which is involved in movement and is also 
related to feelings of pleasure and reward. Dopamine disruptions cause 
problems with attention, motivation, and alertness, and appear to be 
quite important in the development of fear responses.
 
✓ The serotonergic system, which is related to moods, anxiety, and 
aggression.
As these neurotransmitters pulse through your brain, the brain circuitry 
involved in fear and anxiety lights up. Your body then responds with a full-
system alert known as the fight-or-flight response.

 Chapter 3: Sorting Through the Brain and Biology
Preparing to Fight or Flee
When danger presents itself, you reflexively prepare to stand and fight or run 
like you’ve never run before. Your body mobilizes for peril in complex and 
fantastic ways. Figure 3-1 gives you the picture.
Your body responds to threats by preparing for action in three different 
ways: physically, mentally, and behaviorally.
 
✓ Physically: The brain sends signals through your nervous system to go 
on high alert. It tells the adrenal glands to rev up production of adrena-
line and noradrenaline. These hormones stimulate the body in various 
ways. Your heart pounds faster and you start breathing more rapidly, 
sending increased oxygen to your lungs while blood flows to the large 
muscles, preparing them to fight or flee from danger.

40
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
 
 Digestion slows to preserve energy for meeting the challenge, and pupils 
dilate to improve vision. Blood flow decreases to hands and feet to 
minimize blood loss if injured and keep up the blood supply to the large 
muscles. Sweating increases to keep the body cool, and it makes you 
slippery so aggressors can’t grab hold of you. All your muscles tense to 
spring into action.
 
✓ Mentally: You automatically scan your surroundings intensely. Your 
attention focuses on the threat at hand. In fact, you can’t attend to much 
of anything else.
 
✓ Behaviorally: You’re now ready to run or fight. You need that prepara-
tion in the face of danger. When you have to take on a bear, a lion, or a 
warrior, you’d better have all your resources on high alert.
Granted, in today’s world, you’re not very likely to encounter lions and bears. 
Unfortunately, your body reacts too easily with the same preparation to 
fight traffic, meet deadlines, speak in public, and cope with other everyday 
worries.
When human beings have nothing to fight or run from, all that energy has to 
be released in other ways. So you may feel the urge to fidget by moving your 
feet and hands. You may feel like jumping out of your skin. Or you may impul-
sively rant or rave with those around you.
Stress and the common cold
Research has shown that the way people per-
ceive things — possibly more than what’s hap-
pening in reality — affects the immune system 
and the tendency to come down with colds.
Psychologist Dr. Sheldon Cohen and colleagues 
have conducted research on the role of stress 
in susceptibility to the common cold virus. 
In one of his earlier studies, Dr. Cohen asked 
volunteers to describe their stress levels in 
the previous months. He then exposed the par-
ticipants to the cold virus. Those who reported 
high stress came down with colds at far higher 
rates than the volunteers who reported having 
low stress.
A more recent study reported in the journal 
Health Psychology (2008) found that people’s 
self-reported sense of their socioeconomic 
status also predicted who would come down 
with a cold after exposure to the virus. Those 
who felt themselves to be at a lower status 
level got sick more frequently than the others. 
Interestingly, objective measures of socioeco-
nomic status were not so predictive of who 
would get colds. Thus, it seems it’s people’s 
perception of their socioeconomic ranking that 
matters, not the actual ranking itself.
These studies show that the mind and body 
have an intricate relationship. Other research 
has been consistent with this idea, showing 
that stress also slows wound healing, dimin-
ishes the effectiveness of vaccinations, and 
increases inflammation. In other words, the 
way people think about things that happen to 
them strongly affects their bodies.

 Chapter 3: Sorting Through the Brain and Biology
 
Most experts believe that experiencing these physical effects of anxiety on a 
frequent, chronic basis doesn’t do you any good. Various studies have sug-
gested that chronic anxiety and stress contribute to a variety of physical prob-
lems, such as abnormal heart rhythms, high blood pressure, irritable bowel 
syndrome, asthma, ulcers, stomach upset, acid reflux, chronic muscle spasms, 
tremors, chronic back pain, tension headaches, a depressed immune system, 
and even hair loss. Figure 3-2 illustrates the toll of chronic anxiety on the 
body.
Before you get too anxious about your anxiety, please realize that chronic 
anxiety contributes to many of these problems, but we don’t know for sure 
that it’s a major cause of them. Nevertheless, enough studies have suggested 
that anxiety or stress can make these disorders worse to warrant taking 
chronic anxiety seriously. In other words, be concerned, but don’t panic.

Mimicking Anxiety: Drugs, 
Diet, and Diseases
As common as anxiety disorders are, believing that you’re suffering from 
anxiety when you’re not is all too easy. Prescription drugs may have a vari-
ety of side effects, some of which mimic some of the symptoms of anxiety. 
Sometimes what you eat or drink can make you feel anxious. Various medical 
conditions also produce symptoms that imitate the signs of anxiety. We look 
at these anxiety imitators in the following sections.
Exploring anxiety-mimicking drugs
The pharmaceutical industry reports on the most widely prescribed cat-
egories of medications every year. To show you how easily medication side 
effects can resemble the symptoms of anxiety, we list ten of the most widely 
prescribed types of drugs and their anxiety-mimicking side effects in Table 
3-1. These medications have many other side effects that we don’t list here.

Defending against diabetes
As if the misery of chronic anxiety isn’t enough, 
excess stress can deliver another wallop: 
People with long-lasting stress are significantly 
more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. This isn’t 
surprising, because stress increases the levels 
of glucose (sugar) in the bloodstream.
Researchers at Duke University conducted 
a study with over 100 subjects and found that 
when stress management was added to the 
care of adults with diabetes, their blood sugar 
readings actually went down. These techniques 
weren’t complex or time-consuming. In fact, 
many of them are the same techniques that you 
can read about in this book.
The amazing result of this study was that the 
glucose levels of those who found out how to 
calm down dropped as much as would have 
been expected had the subjects been taking an 
extra diabetes-control drug. So if you don’t have 
diabetes, protect yourself by overcoming anxi-
ety, and if you do have diabetes, know that calm 
thoughts may help you control the disease.

Interesting, isn’t it? Even medications for the treatment of anxiety can pro-
duce anxiety-like side effects. Of course, most people don’t experience such 
side effects with these medications, but they do occur. If you’re taking one or 
more of these drugs and feel anxious, check with your doctor.

44
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
 
In addition, various over-the-counter medications sometimes have anxiety-
mimicking side effects. These include cold remedies, bronchodilators (for 
asthma), and decongestants. Also, many types of aspirin contain caffeine, 
which can produce symptoms of anxiety if consumed excessively. These 
medications can cause restlessness, heart palpitations, tension, shortness of 
breath, and irritability.
Ingesting anxiety from your diet
Stress and anxiety often provoke people to binge on unhealthy foods and 
substances, which may lead to increased anxiety over the long run. In 
Chapter 10, we discuss foods that may help you calm your moods and alle-
viate your anxiety. Here we tell you how to avoid foods or drinks that may 
worsen problems with anxiety.
 
Notice whether you have special sensitivities to certain types of food. 
Whenever you feel out of sorts or especially anxious for no particular reason, 
ask yourself what you’ve eaten in the past couple hours. Take notes for a few 
weeks. Although food sensitivities aren’t generally a major cause of anxiety, 
some people have adverse reactions to certain foods, such as nuts, wheat, 
dairy, shellfish, or soy. If your notes say that’s true for you, avoid these foods!
Angst from over the counter
One of the most common ingredients in over-
the-counter cold medications is pseudoephed-
rine, a popular and effective decongestant that 
stimulates the body somewhat like adrenaline. 
I, Dr. Charles Elliott, specialize in the treatment 
of panic and anxiety disorders. A few years 
ago, I had a bad cold and cough for longer than 
usual. I treated it with the strongest over-the-
counter medications that I could find. Not only 
that, I took a little more than the label called for 
during the day so I could see clients without 
coughing through sessions. One day, I noticed 
an unusually rapid heartbeat and consider-
able tightness in breathing. I wondered if I was 
having a panic attack. It didn’t seem possible, 
but the symptoms stared me in the face. Could I 
possibly have caught a panic disorder from my 
clients?
Not exactly. I realized that perhaps I’d taken 
more than just a little too much of the cold medi-
cation containing pseudoephedrine. I stopped 
taking the medication, and the symptoms disap-
peared, never to return.
So, be careful with over-the-counter medica-
tions. Read the directions carefully. Don’t try to 
be your own doctor like I did!

45
 Chapter 3: Sorting Through the Brain and Biology
Limit or avoid alcohol, which can make you feel tense in the long run. Alcohol 
may relax you in small quantities, so many people try to self-medicate by 
imbibing. However, people with anxiety disorders easily become addicted to it. 
Furthermore, in excess, alcohol can lead to a variety of anxiety-like symptoms. 
For example, after a night of heavy drinking, alcohol can leave you feeling more 
anxious because it clears the system quickly and the body craves more. That 
craving can lead to addiction over time.
Caffeine can also spell trouble. Some people seem to thrive on triple espres-
sos, but others find themselves up all night with the jitters. Caffeine lurks in 
most energy drinks as well as chocolate, so be careful if you’re sensitive to 
the effects of caffeine.
 
Speaking of energy drinks, these sometimes contain unusually large quanti-
ties of not only caffeine but also other stimulants. You’ll see herbal stimulants 
such as taurine, guarana (loaded with caffeine), ginseng, and ginkgo biloba, 
among others. Reported adverse effects include nervousness, sleeplessness, 
abnormal heart rhythms, and seizures. If you have excessive anxiety, you 
don’t want to be chugging down these concoctions.
Finally, lots of people get nervous after eating too much sugar. Watch 
kids at birthday parties or Halloween. Adults can have the same reaction. 
Furthermore, sugar is bad for your body in a variety of ways, such as spiking 
blood glucose levels and contributing to metabolic syndrome (a condition 
that often leads to high blood pressure and diabetes).
The chicken or the egg: Irritable bowel syndrome
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common 
condition that involves a variety of related 
problems, usually including cramps or pain in 
the abdomen, diarrhea, and/or constipation. 
These occur in people with no known physical 
problems in their digestive systems. For many 
years, doctors told most of their patients that 
irritable bowel syndrome was caused by stress, 
worry, and anxiety.
In 1999, Catherine Woodman, MD, and col-
leagues discovered a mutated gene in patients 
with IBS more often than in those without it. 
Interestingly, that same rogue gene also occurs 
more often in those with panic disorders. Other 
possible physical causes of IBS may have to 
do with poor communication between muscles 
and nerves in the colon.
Various medications have been found to 
decrease some of the worst symptoms of IBS. 
In addition, psychotherapy that teaches relax-
ation techniques, biofeedback, and techniques 
for coping with anxiety and stress also improves 
IBS symptoms. So at this point, no one really 
knows to what extent IBS is caused by physi-
cal causes, anxiety, or stress. It’s more likely, 
however, that the mind and body interact in 
important ways that can’t always be separated.

Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
Investigating medical anxiety imposters
 
More than a few types of diseases and medical conditions can create anxiety-
like symptoms. That’s why we strongly recommend that you visit your doctor, 
especially if you’re experiencing significant anxiety for the first time. Your 
doctor can help you sort out whether you have a physical problem, a reaction 
to a medication, an emotionally based anxiety problem, or some combination of 
these. Table 3-2 lists some medical conditions that produce anxiety symptoms.
Getting sick can cause anxiety, too. For example, if you receive a serious diag-
nosis of heart disease, cancer, or a chronic progressive disorder, you may 
develop anxiety about dealing with the consequences of what you’ve been 
told. The techniques we give you for dealing with anxiety throughout this 
book can help you manage this type of anxiety as well.

Clearing the Roadblocks 
to Change
In This Chapter
▶ Finding out where your anxiety comes from
▶ Looking at resistance
▶ Watching worries ebb and flow
▶ Getting the right help
T
he odds are that if you’re reading this book, you want to do something 
about your own anxiety or help someone you love. If so, you should 
know that sometimes people start on the path to change with the best inten-
tions, but as they move along, they suddenly encounter icy conditions, lose 
traction, spin their wheels, and slide off the road.
This chapter gives you ways to throw salt and sand on the ice and keep 
moving forward. First, we explain where anxiety comes from. When you 
understand the origins of anxiety, you can move from self-blame to self-
acceptance, thus allowing yourself to direct your energy away from self-abuse 
and toward more productive activities. Next, we show you the other big bar-
riers that block the way to change. We give you effective strategies to keep 
you safely on the road to overcoming anxiety. And finally, if you need some 
outside support, we give you suggestions on how to find professional help.
Digging Out the Roots of Anxiety
Anxiety doesn’t come out of nowhere; rather, it typically stems from some 
combination of three major contributing factors. The primary villains under-
lying anxiety are
 
✓ Genetics: Your biological inheritance
 
✓ Parenting: The way that you were raised
 
✓ Trauma: Horrific events that sometimes happen

48
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
Studies show that of those people who experience an unanticipated trauma, 
only a minority end up with severe anxiety. That’s because anxiety stems 
from a combination of causes — perhaps genes and trauma, trauma and par-
enting, or even all three factors may gang up to induce anxiety. Some people 
seem almost immune to developing anxiety, yet it’s possible that life could 
deal them a blow that challenges their coping abilities in a way they couldn’t 
expect. In the story that follows, Bonnie shows how someone can show resil-
ience for many years yet be tipped over the edge by a single traumatic event.
Bonnie manages to grow up in a drug war zone without developing ter-
ribly distressing symptoms. One night, bullets whiz through her bedroom 
window and one pierces her abdomen. She shows surprising resilience 
during her recovery. Surely, she must have some robust anti-anxiety 
genes and perhaps some pretty good parents in order to successfully 
endure such an experience. However, when she is raped at the age of 16, 
she develops post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; see Chapter 2 for 
more information). Bonnie has sustained one trauma too many.
Thus, as Bonnie’s example illustrates, you can never know for certain the 
exact cause of anyone’s anxiety with absolute certainty. However, if you 
examine someone’s childhood relationship with her parents, family his-
tory, and the various events in her life (such as accidents, war, disease, and 
so on), you can generally come up with good ideas as to why anxiety now 
causes problems. If you have anxiety, think about which of the causes of anxi-
ety have contributed to your troubles.
What difference does it make where your anxiety comes from? Overcoming 
anxiety doesn’t absolutely require knowledge of where it originated. The rem-
edies change little whether you were born with anxiety or acquired it much 
later in your life.
The benefit of identifying the source of your anxiety lies in helping you real-
ize anxiety isn’t something you brought on yourself. Anxiety develops for a 
number of good, solid reasons, which we elaborate on in the following sec-
tions. The blame doesn’t belong with the person who has anxiety.
 
Guilt and self-blame only sap you of energy. They drain resources and keep 
your focus away from the effort required for challenging anxiety. By contrast, 
self-forgiveness and self-acceptance energize and even motivate your efforts 
(we cover these ideas later in the chapter).
It’s in my genes!
If you suffer from excessive worries and tension, look at the rest of your 
family. Of those who have an anxiety disorder, typically about a quarter of 
their relatives suffer along with them. So your Uncle Ralph may not struggle 
with anxiety, but Aunt Melinda or your sister Charlene just might.

49
 Chapter 4: Clearing the Roadblocks to Change
Maybe you’re able to make the argument that Uncle Ralph, Aunt Melinda, and 
your sister Charlene all had to live with Grandma, who’d make anyone anx-
ious. In other words, they lived in an anxiety-inducing environment. Maybe it 
has nothing to do with their genes.
Various researchers have studied siblings and twins who live together to 
verify that genes do play an important role as to how people experience and 
cope with anxiety. As predicted, identical twins were far more similar to each 
other in terms of anxiety than fraternal twins or other siblings. But even if 
you’re born with a genetic predisposition toward anxiety, other factors — 
such as environment, peers, and how your parents raised you — enter into 
the mix.
It’s how I was raised!
Blaming parents for almost anything that ails you is easy. Parents usually do 
the best they can. Raising children poses a formidable task. So in most cases, 
parents don’t deserve as much blame as they receive. However, they do hold 
responsibility for the way that you were brought up to the extent that it may 
have contributed to your woes.
Three parenting styles appear to foster anxiety in children:
 
✓ Over-protectors: These parents shield their kids from every imaginable 
stress or harm. If their kids stumble, they swoop them up before they 
even hit the ground. When their kids get upset, they fix the problem. Not 
surprisingly, their kids fail to find out how to tolerate fear, anxiety, or 
frustration.
 
✓ Over-controllers: These parents micro-manage all their children’s activi-
ties. They direct every detail from how they should play to what they 
should wear to how they solve arithmetic problems. They discourage 
independence and fertilize dependency and anxiety.
 
✓ Inconsistent responders: The parents in this group provide their kids 
with erratic rules and limits. One day, they respond with understanding 
when their kids have trouble with their homework; the next day, they 
explode when their kids ask for help. These kids fail to discover the con-
nection between their own efforts and a predictable outcome. Therefore, 
they feel that they have little control over what happens in life. It’s no 
wonder that they feel anxious.
If you recognize your own parenting style in any of these descriptions and 
worry that your behavior may be affecting your child, flip to Chapter 20 to 
see how you can help your child overcome her anxiety.

Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
It’s the world’s fault!
The world today moves at a faster pace than ever, and the workweek has 
gradually inched upward rather than the other way around. Modern life is 
filled with both complexity and danger. Perhaps that’s why mental-health 
workers see more people with anxiety-related problems than ever before. 
Four specific types of events can trigger a problem with anxiety, even in 
someone who has never suffered from it much before:
 
✓ Unanticipated threats: Predictability and stability counteract anxiety; 
uncertainty and chaos fuel it. For example, Calvin works long hours to 
make a decent living. Nevertheless, he lives from paycheck to paycheck 
with little left for savings. A freak slip on an icy patch of sidewalk dis-
ables him for six weeks, and he has insufficient sick leave to cover his 
absence. He now worries obsessively over his ability to pay bills. Even 
when he returns to work, he worries more than ever about the next 
financial booby trap that awaits him.
 
✓ Escalating demands: Having too much responsibility piled on your plate 
can make you anxious. Jake initially thinks that nothing is better than 
a promotion when his supervisor hands him a once-in-a-lifetime oppor-
tunity to direct the new high-risk research and development division at 
work. Jake never expected such a lofty position or the doubling of his 
salary this early in his career. Of course, new duties, expectations, and 
responsibilities come along for the ride. Jake now begins to fret and 
worry. What if he fails to meet the challenge? Anxiety starts taking over 
his life.
 
✓ Confidence killers: Unexpected criticisms and rejections can certainly 
trigger anxiety. Tricia is on top of the world. She has a good job and 
feels ecstatic about her upcoming wedding. However, she is stunned 
when her fiancé backs out of the proposal. Now, she worries incessantly 
that something is wrong with her; perhaps she’ll never have the life she 
envisioned for herself.
 
✓ Terrorizing trauma: No one ever wants to experience a horrifying 
or even life-threatening experience. Unfortunately, these bitter pills 
do happen. Horrific accidents, acts of terrorism, pandemics, natural 
disasters, battlefield injuries, and violence have occurred for centuries, 
and we suspect they always will. When they do, severe problems with 
anxiety often emerge. Thus, survivors of tsunamis often have residual 
anxiety or PTSD (see Chapters 2 and 8) for years because of the totally 
unexpected nature of the event.

51
 Chapter 4: Clearing the Roadblocks to Change
Finding Self-Acceptance
Time and again, we see our worried, tense clients suffer from another need-
less source of pain. Their anxiety is bad enough, but they also pound on 
themselves because they have anxiety. Such self-abuse involves harsh, criti-
cal judgments. If you do this to yourself, we suggest that you try the following 
approach to self-acceptance.
 
Start by making a list of all the likely causes of your problems with anxiety. 
First, list any possible genetic contributions that you can think of in your rela-
tives who may suffer from anxiety. Then review how your parents may have 
either modeled anxiety or instilled it in you because of their harsh or unpre-
dictable parenting style. Then review events in your world from the distant to 
recent past that were highly anxiety-arousing. Finally, after you list the likely 
culprits that led to your distress, ask yourself some questions like the ones 
that follow:
 
✓ Did I ask for my anxiety?
 
✓ Was there ever a time in my life that I actually wanted to feel anxious?
 
✓ Am I primarily to blame for my worries?
 
✓ What percentage of the blame can I realistically assign to myself as 
opposed to genes, parenting, and events, both old and new?
 
✓ If a couple of friends of mine had troubles with anxiety, what would I say 
to them?
 
• Would I think they were to blame?
 
• Would I think as ill of them as I do myself?
 
✓ Does thinking badly about myself help me to get over my anxiety?
 
✓ If I decided to stop pummeling myself, would I have more energy for 
tackling my problems?
These questions can help you move toward self-acceptance and discover that 
having anxiety has nothing to do with your worth or value as a human being. 
Then you just might lighten up on yourself a little. We recommend it highly. 
Mind you, people get down on themselves at times. But chronic, unrelenting 
self-abuse is another matter. If you find yourself completely unable to let go 
of self-abuse, you may want to seek professional help (see the related sec-
tion at the end of this chapter). You can read more about self-acceptance in 
Chapter 13.
Gary’s story illustrates how reviewing the causes of your anxiety, followed 
by asking yourself those important questions, can help you acquire self-
acceptance.

Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
Gary has developed panic disorder. His attacks of feeling nauseous, 
dizzy, and thinking he’s going crazy have increased recently. He feels 
shame that someone like him has this problem. When he starts having 
panic attacks at work, he seeks help. He tells his psychologist that a real 
man would never have this kind of problem. His psychologist helps Gary 
to be more self-forgiving. He asks Gary to write down the causes of his 
anxiety. He tells him to thoroughly review his life and come up with as 
many contributors to his anxiety as he can. Table 4-1 shows what Gary 
comes up with.

Anxiety among the rich and famous
So many of our clients seem to think that they’re 
the only people in the world who struggle with 
anxiety. But we let them know that many mil-
lions of Americans suffer from anxiety. Perhaps 
you won’t feel quite so alone if you consider 
some of the famous people throughout history 
who’ve suffered from one or more of the various 
anxiety disorders discussed in this book.
Reportedly, Albert Einstein and Eleanor 
Roosevelt both suffered from fears of social 
situations. Further, Charles Darwin eventu-
ally became a virtual hermit because of his 
disabling agoraphobia (see Chapter 2). Robert 
Frost also battled anxiety.
Billionaire Howard Hughes had many emotional 
problems — among them, apparently, a severe 
case of obsessive-compulsive disorder (see 
Chapter 2). Hughes insisted on having three 
copies of a magazine delivered to him. When 
delivered, Hughes removed the middle maga-
zine with his hands covered in tissue paper. 
Then he would instruct an assistant to burn 
the other two magazines. In addition, Hughes 
had other bizarre compulsions involving prepa-
ration of his food, the handling of objects, and 
toileting.
Finally, a search on the Internet shows you that 
hundreds of celebrities reputedly suffer from 
all kinds of severe problems with anxiety. Use a 
search engine and type in “famous people and 
anxiety.” You’ll be surprised by what you find.

By reviewing the causes of his anxiety and asking himself the questions listed 
earlier in this section, Gary moves from self-abuse to self-acceptance. Now 
he’s ready to work on overcoming his anxiety.
Having Second Thoughts about Change
Clearly, no one likes feeling anxious, tense, and nervous, and sometimes 
anxiety climbs to such heights that it overwhelms personal resources and 
the capacity to cope. Chronic, severe anxiety not infrequently serves as a 
prelude to serious depression. Obviously, anyone experiencing this torment 
would jump at the chance to do something about it.
With good intentions, people buy self-help books, attend workshops, and 
even seek therapy. They fully intend to make meaningful changes in their 
lives. But have you ever gone to a health club in January? It’s packed with 
new, enthusiastic members. By mid-March, health clubs return to normal. 
Like so many New Year’s resolutions, the initial burst of resolve too often 
fades. What happens to all that determination? Folks generally think they’ve 
simply lost their willpower. Actually, interfering thoughts creep into their 
minds and steal their motivation. They start to think that they don’t have the 
time or the money or that they can get in shape later. Such thoughts seduce 
them into abandoning their goals.

54
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
Thoughts about abandoning your quest to overcome anxiety may disrupt 
your efforts at some point. If so, the first step involves identifying the 
thoughts that are streaming through your mind. The next step is to fight off 
these counterproductive thoughts; we give you strategies for doing just that 
in the following section. But first, in the style of late-night talk-show host 
David Letterman, here are our top ten excuses for staying stuck:
 
✓ Number 10: Anxiety isn’t really that big a problem for me. I thought it 
was when I bought this book, but my anxiety isn’t as bad as some of the 
people I’ve been reading about. Maybe it’s not that big a deal.
 
✓ Number 9: If I try and fail, I’ll make a fool of myself. My friends and 
family would think I was stupid to even try.
 
✓ Number 8: My anxiety feels too overwhelming to tackle. I just don’t 
know if I could handle the additional stress of even thinking about it.
 
✓ Number 7: I’m afraid of trying and not getting anywhere. That would 
make me feel even worse than if I did nothing at all. I’d feel like a failure.
 
✓ Number 6: Feelings can’t really be controlled. You’re just fooling your-
self if you think otherwise. You feel the way you feel.
 
✓ Number 5: I’ll do something about my anxiety when I feel the motiva-
tion. Right now, I don’t really feel like it. I’m sure the motivation will 
come; I just have to wait for it.
 
✓ Number 4: Who would I be without my anxiety? That’s just who I am. I’m 
an anxious person; it’s just me.
 
✓ Number 3: I don’t believe I can really change. After all, I’ve been this way 
my entire life. Books like this one don’t work anyway.
 
✓ Number 2: I’m too busy to do anything about my anxiety. These activities 
look like they take time. I could never work it into my hectic schedule.
 
✓ And the number 1 reason people stay stuck: I’m too anxious to do any-
thing about my anxiety. Whenever I think about confronting my anxiety, 
it makes me feel worse.
Look over our preceding list several times. Mull over each excuse, and circle 
any that seem familiar or reasonable to you. Agreeing with any of these will 
hinder your progress. Now, we have some ways for you to challenge these 
excuses, no matter how reasonable they may seem.
Deciding to Get the Show on the Road
If any of our top ten excuses for staying stuck (see the preceding section) 
resonate with you, then your decision to overcome anxiety is not stable. 
Those thoughts can sabotage your best intentions. Don’t underestimate their 
power.

55
 Chapter 4: Clearing the Roadblocks to Change
The next two sections show you a couple of strategies for helping you turn 
your intentions into actions.
 
If you start losing your motivation or your belief in your ability to do some-
thing about your anxiety, come back to this section! It can help you get back 
on track.
Arguing with your arguments
 
Consider starting a notebook for carrying out various exercises in this book. 
Whether you use a notebook, computer file, or paper file, divide a page 
into two columns. Label the left column “Excuses” and the right Column 
“Arguments Against My Excuses.” Under “Excuses” write each of the top ten 
excuses (see the earlier section “Having Second Thoughts about Change”) that 
apply to you. Then, as a way to come up with arguments against your excuses, 
ask yourself the following questions:
 
✓ Does my excuse presume a catastrophe is coming?
 
✓ Am I exaggerating the truth?
 
✓ Can I find any evidence that would contradict my excuse?
 
✓ Can I think of people to whom my excuse doesn’t apply? And if it doesn’t 
apply to them, why should it apply to me?
 
✓ Am I trying to predict the future with negative thinking when no one can 
ever know the future?
Using those questions to guide your effort, jot down the best arguments you 
can for picking your excuses apart. The following example of Miguel shows 
how he attacked one of his most stubborn excuses for not changing.
Miguel suffers from anxiety and has resisted dealing with his problem 
for years. He lists his major excuses for not doing anything and uses the 
preceding questions to develop arguments against them. He develops 
arguments for each of his excuses. Table 4-2 shows what he came up with 
for what he considered his most compelling excuse.
Miguel discovered that arguing against his excuses finally gave him the cour-
age to start making changes. You can do the same.

Against His Excuse
Excuse for Staying Stuck
Arguments Against My Excuse
Feelings can’t really be controlled. 
You’re just fooling yourself if you think 
otherwise. You feel the way you feel.
Evidence tells me I’ve made other 
changes in my life. Many people go 
to therapy for some reason; surely 
it makes them feel better or there 
wouldn’t be a zillion therapists in the 
world. My best friend overcame his 
anxiety, so why can’t I?
Taking baby steps
If you find that the idea of dealing with your anxiety is just too much to 
handle, you may be struggling with excuse number 8 for staying stuck (see 
the earlier section “Having Second Thoughts about Change”): “My anxiety 
feels too overwhelming to tackle. I just don’t know if I could handle the addi-
tional stress of even thinking about it.” In this case, it may help if you start by 
putting one foot in front of the other — take baby steps.
Stop dwelling on the entire task. For example, if you thought about all the 
steps that you’ll take over the next five years, you’d be envisioning an incred-
ible amount of walking. Hundreds, if not thousands, of miles await you. The 
mere thought of all those miles could stress you out.
You may, like many folks, wake up early in the morning on some days facing 
huge lists of things you need to do in the coming week. Ugh. A sense of defeat 
sets in, and you feel like staying in bed for the rest of the day. Dread replaces 
enthusiasm. If, instead, you clear your mind of the entire agenda and concentrate 
on only the first item on the list, your distress is likely to diminish, at least a little.
In order to take baby steps, it’s a good idea to write down your overall, end-
point goal. For example, perhaps you eventually hope to be able to give an 
hour-long speech in front of a crowd without being overcome with fear, or 
maybe you want to be able to master your fear of heights by taking a tram-
way to the top of a mountain.
 
Sit down and chart out your ultimate goal, and then chart a goal that isn’t 
quite so lofty to serve as a stepping stone — an intermediate goal. Then chart 
out the action that would be required of you to meet that goal. If your interme-
diate goal feels doable, you can start with it. If not, break it down further into 
smaller goals, even baby steps. It doesn’t matter how small you make your 
first step. Anything that moves you just a little in the right direction can get 
you going and increase your confidence with one step at a time. Here’s how 
Paula put this plan into action.

57
 Chapter 4: Clearing the Roadblocks to Change
Paula has a social phobia. She can’t stand the idea of attending social 
functions. She feels that the moment that she walks into a group, all eyes 
focus on her, which sends her anxiety through the roof. She desperately 
wants to change. But the idea of attending large parties or company func-
tions overwhelms her with terror. Look at Table 4-3 to see how Paula 
broke the task down into baby steps.

Ultimate goal
Going to a large party, staying the entire time, and talking with 
numerous people without fear.
Intermediate 
goal
Going to a small party, staying a little while, and talking to a 
couple people although feeling a little scared.
Small goal
Going to a work-related social hour, staying 30 minutes, and 
talking to at least one person in spite of some anxiety.
First baby step
Calling a friend and asking her to go to lunch in spite of anxiety.
Persevering through the peaks and valleys
A group of psychologists has conducted exten-
sive research on how people make important 
changes, such as quitting smoking, losing 
weight, and overcoming emotional difficulties. 
They found that change isn’t a straightforward 
process. It includes a number of stages.
Precontemplation: In this stage, people haven’t 
even given a thought to doing anything about 
their problem. They may deny having any dif-
ficulty at all.
Contemplation: People start thinking about 
tackling their problem. But in this stage, it feels 
a little out of their reach to do anything about it.
Preparation: In preparation, people develop a 
plan for change. They gather their resources 
and make resolutions.
Action: The real work begins, and the plan goes 
into action.
Maintenance: Now is the time to hold one’s 
ground. People must hang tough to prevent 
sliding back. During this phase, one wants to 
develop a plan for dealing with both expected 
and unexpected problematic events.
Termination: The change has become habit, so 
much so that relapse is less likely and further 
work isn’t particularly necessary.
These stages look like a straight line from pre-
contemplation to termination, but what these 
psychologists found is that people bounce 
around the stages in various ways. They may 
go from contemplation to action without having 
made adequate preparation. Others may reach 
the maintenance stage and give up on their 
efforts, slipping back to the precontemplation 
stage.
Many successful changers bounce back and 
forth in these stages a number of times before 
finally achieving their goals. So don’t get dis-
couraged if that happens to you. Keep your goal 
in mind, and restart your efforts if you slip. Yep. 
Try, try, and try again.

58
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
Paula found that starting with a brief phone call to a friend helped get her 
moving. From there, she moved to the next step and continued on. Some 
people find that breaking tasks down into many smaller steps helps, espe-
cially for formidable goals. See Chapter 8 for more information about taking 
action against anxiety in graded steps.
Watching Worries Come and Go
Sometimes anxiety feels like it will never go away. Believing that you have no 
control over it and that stress invades your every waking moment is easy. 
This section helps you to realize that anxiety actually has an ebb and flow. 
We show you how taking a few minutes to write down your feelings each day 
may discharge a little of your anxiety and possibly improve your health. We 
also help you understand that progress, like anxiety, ebbs and flows.
Following your fears
One of the best early steps that you can take to conquer anxiety is to simply 
follow it every day in a couple of different ways. Why would you want to do 
that? After all, you already know full well that you’re anxious. Watching your 
worries is a good idea because it starts the process of change. You discover 
important patterns, triggers, and insights into your anxiety.
Observing anxiety fulfills several useful functions. First, monitoring forces 
you to be aware of your emotions. Avoiding and running away from troubling 
emotions only causes them to escalate. Second, you’ll see that your anxiety 
goes up and down throughout the day — which isn’t quite as upsetting as 
thinking it rules every moment of your life. And you’re likely to discover that 
recording your ratings can help you to take charge and feel more in control 
of what’s going on inside of you. Finally, keeping track helps you see how 
you’re progressing in your efforts to quell your distress.
 
Track your anxiety in a notebook for a few weeks. Notice patterns or differ-
ences in intensity. Carry your anxiety-tracking notebook with you, and try to 
fill it out at the same time each day. On a scale of one to ten, ten being total 
panic and one being complete calm, rate the level of anxiety you experience 
around the same time in the morning, then again in the afternoon, and later in 
the evening. Virginia’s story shows you how tracking anxiety can be helpful.
Virginia complains to her friends that she’s the most nervous person 
on the planet and that she’s close to a nervous breakdown. Recently, 
her father had heart surgery and her husband lost his job. Virginia feels 
completely out of control and says that her anxiety never stops. When 
her counselor suggests that she start tracking her anxiety, she tells him,

“You’ve got to be kidding. I don’t need to do that. I can tell you right now 
that I’m anxious all the time. There’s no letup.” He urges her to go ahead 
and try anyway. Table 4-4 shows what Virginia comes up with in her first 
week of tracking.

Virginia discovers a few things. First, she notices that her anxiety is routinely 
less intense in the morning. It also escalates in the afternoon and peaks in 
the evenings. With only one week’s records, she can’t discern whether her 
anxiety level is decreasing, increasing, or remaining stable. However, she 
notices feeling a little better simply because she feels like she’s starting to 
take charge of her problem. She also realizes that some days are better than 
others and that her anxiety varies rather than overwhelming her all the time.
Writing about your worries
Millions of people keep a diary at some point in their lives. Some develop 
daily writing as a lifelong habit. Keeping a journal of life’s emotionally signifi-
cant events has surprising benefits:
 
✓ Journal writing appears to decrease the number of visits people make to 
the doctor for physical complaints.
 
✓ Writing increases the production of T cells that are beneficial to the 
immune system.
 
✓ Keeping a journal about emotional events improved the grades of a 
group of college students compared to those who wrote about trivial 
matters.
 
✓ Recently, unemployed workers who wrote about the trauma of losing 
their jobs found new employment more quickly than those who did not.

Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
Throwing out the rule book
Journal writing doesn’t have rules. You can write about anything, anywhere, 
anytime. However, if you want the full benefits of writing in a journal, we 
encourage you to write about feelings and the emotionally important events 
of your life. Write about anything that troubles you during the day and/or 
past difficulties. Spend a little time on it.
 
Writing about past traumas may bring considerable relief. However, if you find 
that the task floods you with overwhelming grief or anxiety, you’ll probably 
find it helpful to seek professional assistance.
Counting your blessings: An antidote for anxiety
Writing about your distressing feelings makes a great start. However, if you’d 
like more bang for your buck, take a few extra minutes and write about what 
you feel grateful for each day. Why? Because positive emotions help coun-
teract negative emotions. Writing about your boons and blessings improves 
mood, increases optimism, and may benefit your health.
At first blush, you may think that you have little to be grateful for. Anxiety 
can so easily cloud vision. Did your mother ever urge you to clean your plate 
because of the “starving kids in China?” As much as we think that pushing 
kids to eat is a bad idea, her notion to consider those less fortunate has 
value. Take some time to ponder the positive events and people in your life.
 
✓ Kindnesses: Think about those who have extended kindness to you.
 
✓ Education: Obviously, you can read; that’s a blessing compared to the 
millions in the world with no chance for an education.
The power of positive psychology
The field of psychology focused on nega-
tive emotions for most of the 20th century. 
Psychologists studied depression, anxiety, 
schizophrenia, behavior disorders, and a slew 
of other maladies. Only recently has the field 
looked at the pluses of positive emotions, the 
characteristics of happy people, and the com-
ponents of well-being. People who feel grateful 
usually say they feel happier as well.
A study reported in the Journal of Social and 
Clinical Psychology (2000, volume 19) assigned 
people to three groups. The first group wrote 
only about the hassles of everyday life. The 
researchers asked the second group to write 
about emotionally neutral events. The third 
group journaled about experiences that they 
were grateful for. All the groups performed this 
task merely once a week for ten weeks. At the 
end of the experiment, the group that wrote 
about gratitude exercised more, had fewer 
physical complaints, and felt more optimistic 
than those in the other two groups. That such 
an easy, simple task could be so beneficial is 
surprising.

61
 Chapter 4: Clearing the Roadblocks to Change
 
✓ Nourishment: You probably aren’t starving to death, whereas (as your 
mother may have noted) millions are.
 
✓ Home: Do you live in a cardboard box or do you have a roof over your 
head?
 
✓ Pleasure: Can you smell flowers, hear birds sing, or touch the soft fur of 
a pet?
Sources of possible gratitude abound — freedom, health, companionship, 
and so on. Everyone has a different list.
 
The brain tends to focus on what’s wrong or threatening in our lives. Noticing 
and actively appreciating what’s right helps counteract that tendency and will 
make you feel better.
Getting Help from Others
If your problems with anxiety are significantly interfering with your life, 
you’re probably going to want to work with a mental-health professional in 
addition to reading this book. In the following two sections, we tell you what 
kind of treatment to ask for and give you a set of questions to ask a potential 
therapist before you begin treatment.
Seeking the right therapies
Mental-health professionals offer a wide variety of treatments. We’ve thor-
oughly studied the research on what works for anxiety disorders so you don’t 
have to. Studies consistently show that two treatments stand out as the most 
effective for this type of problem — cognitive therapy and behavior therapy, as 
well as a combination of the two (known as cognitive behavior therapy or CBT):
 
✓ Cognitive therapy focuses on teaching you new ways of thinking. People 
with anxiety often have distortions in the way they perceive events, and 
this approach helps you correct those distortions. For example, an anxious 
client may be overestimating the risks involved with flying. A cognitive 
approach would help her discover that the risks are small enough to war-
rant tackling her fear. See Chapters 5, 6, and 7 for a thorough discussion 
about how cognitive therapy can be applied to your problems with anxiety.
 
✓ Behavior therapy operates on the premise that changing the way you 
act or behave changes the way you feel about the things that happen in 
your life. Using the previous example of the woman with a fear of flying, 
a behavior therapist would likely help the woman go through a series of 
steps related to flying such as watching movies of flying, going to the air-
port, and eventually booking and taking a flight. Chapter 8 reviews how 
to bring behavior therapy principles to bear on your anxiety.

62
Part I: Detecting and Exposing Anxiety 
Other therapies work for other types of problems, and some also work for 
anxiety, too. But nothing has been shown to beat cognitive therapy, behavior 
therapy, and their combination (CBT) for anxiety disorders.
 
Medications also play a role in the treatment of some anxiety disorders. We 
usually don’t recommend using them as your sole strategy, however. See 
Chapter 9 for a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of medication 
for anxiety.
Seeking the right therapist
In addition to knowing the right therapy, you need to know whom to look 
for. Start by making sure that the therapist you seek is licensed to provide 
mental-health services, whether as a counselor, psychiatrist, psychiatric 
nurse, psychologist, or social worker. Sources for finding one of these 
licensed practitioners include local professional associations (such as state 
psychology associations, state counselor associations, and so forth), your 
primary healthcare provider, your insurance company, or trusted friends and 
family who can recommend someone.
After you’ve found someone who seems to fit the bill, be sure to ask the fol-
lowing questions:
 
✓ What are your charges for services, and does my insurance cover them?
 
✓ What are your hours?
 
✓ How soon can you see me?
 
✓ What is your experience in treating anxiety disorders?
 
✓ Do you take a cognitive or behavioral approach in treating anxiety?
 
✓ Are you willing to collaborate with my doctor?
 
You should feel comfortable talking with your therapist. After a few sessions, 
you should feel listened to and understood and sense that your therapist has 
legitimate empathy and concern for your well-being. Don’t hesitate to inquire 
about the nature of your treatment plan — that plan should make sense to 
you. Most therapists take a few weeks getting to know you before they formu-
late an entire plan. If you’re uncomfortable for any reason, by all means seek 
a second opinion from another therapist. Research shows that how you feel 
about the relationship with your therapist makes a big difference in how well 
the therapy goes.

Part II
Battling Anxiety

In this part . . .
W
e talk about one of the most effective therapies for 
anxiety and show you methods for tracking your 
anxiety-arousing thoughts, along with ways to change anx-
ious thoughts into calmer thinking. Next you see how the 
very words you use to think about yourself and the world 
can intensify anxiety. The good news is that you can 
replace your worry words with more reasonable language. 
In so doing, your anxiety decreases.
Then we describe the agitating assumptions that underlie 
many anxious thoughts. You discover which agitating 
assumptions plague you and how you can do something 
about them. We also show you how to battle anxiety by 
changing your behavior. This part concludes with a 
review of medical and biological strategies for treating 
anxiety.

Chapter 5
Becoming a Thought Detective
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the thought/feeling connection
▶ Monitoring your anxious thoughts
▶ Rethinking anxious thoughts
▶ Designing pleasant thoughts
T
houghts powerfully influence your emotions. At the same time, your feel-
ings also influence your thoughts. In order to battle anxiety, you need to 
be aware of both your thoughts and feelings.
The following true story from our lives illustrates how profoundly thoughts 
influence the way people feel.
Some time ago, we took a cruise to reward ourselves for completing a 
major project. One evening, we sat on deck chairs enjoying a fabulous 
sunset: Brilliant red and orange clouds melted into the deep blue sea. 
The wind picked up ever so slightly, and the ship rolled gently. We 
sat relaxed, quietly enjoying the scene and the cradle-like motion. We 
reflected that in our lifetime, we had rarely felt so at peace.
The captain’s weather announcement interrupted our tranquil state of 
mind. Apologizing for the inconvenience, he informed us that because 
of a hurricane, he would have to steer a slightly different course, and we 
may feel some choppy seas. Still, he assured us that the storm presented 
no threat.
The breeze suddenly felt chilling. The clouds, so spectacular before, 
appeared ominous. The gentle roll that had relaxed us now generated 
nervousness. Yet nothing about the sky or the sea had changed from 
moments earlier.
Our thoughts jerked us from blissful relaxation to mounting anxiety. We 
pulled our jacket tighter and commented that the weather looked nasty, 
and perhaps we’d be better off inside.
Clearly, our thoughts, or the way we interpreted the weather, greatly affected 
the way we felt. A state of relaxed bliss turned into nervous anxiety even 
though the weather itself had not changed.

66
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
In this chapter, we show you how to become aware of your feelings and 
thoughts as well as the events that connect them. The goal is to become a 
thought detective, able to uncover the thoughts that contribute to anxious feel-
ings. We show you how to gather evidence and put your thoughts on trial. We 
help you see how thoughts all too easily trigger your anxiety, and we give you 
proven techniques for transforming your anxious thoughts into calm thoughts.
Distinguishing Thoughts from Feelings
Psychologists often query their clients to find out how they feel about recent 
events in their lives. Frequently, clients answer with how they think about the 
events rather than how they feel. Others know how they feel but are stumped 
when it comes to what they’re thinking. In the next section, we discuss why 
people often end up out of touch with their feelings, thoughts, or both. Then, 
we discuss how to tune your thoughts and feelings.
Blocking the blues
People often have trouble identifying and labeling their feelings and emotions, 
especially negative ones. Actually, the difficulty makes sense for two reasons.
First, emotions often hurt. No one wants to feel profound sadness, grief, 
anxiety, or fear. One simple solution is to avoid feelings entirely, and many 
creative ways to avoid emotion are available. Unfortunately, most of these 
methods can be destructive:
 
✓ Workaholism: Some folks work all the time rather than think about 
what’s disturbing them.
 
✓ Alcoholism and drug abuse: When people feel bad, numbing their emo-
tions with drugs and alcohol provides a temporary, artificial emotional 
lift; of course, habitually doing so can lead to addiction, ill health, and 
sometimes, even death.
 
✓ Denial and repression: One strategy for not feeling is to fool yourself 
by pretending that nothing is wrong. Denial is often thought to be a con-
scious process whereas repression is done outside of people’s aware-
ness, but the result is pretty much the same.
 
✓ Sensation seeking: High-risk activities, such as sexual promiscuity and 
compulsive gambling, can all push away distress for a while.
 
✓ Distraction: Athletics, entertainment, hobbies, television, surfing the 
Internet, and many other activities can cover up bad feelings. Unlike 
the preceding strategies, distraction can be a good thing. It’s only when 
distractions are used in excess to cover up and avoid feelings that they 
become problematic.

67
 Chapter 5: Becoming a Thought Detective
The second reason that identifying, expressing, and labeling feelings is such 
a struggle for people is because they’re taught from an early age that they 
“shouldn’t” feel certain feelings. Parents, teachers, friends, and relatives bom-
bard kids with “don’t feel” messages. See the following examples of “don’t 
feel” messages that you’ve probably heard before:
 
✓ Big boys don’t cry; don’t be a baby!
 
✓ You shouldn’t feel that way!
 
✓ Get over it!
 
✓ It couldn’t possibly hurt that bad.
 
✓ Don’t be a scared chicken.
 
✓ Stop crying or I’ll give you something to cry about!
That many people are described as “out of touch with their feelings” is no 
wonder. The problem with the habitual tendency to avoid feelings is that 
you don’t find out how to cope with or resolve the underlying issue. Chronic 
avoidance creates a certain kind of low-level stress that builds over time.
Getting in touch with your feelings
Noticing your emotions can help you gain insight and discover how to cope 
more effectively. If you don’t know what your feelings are, when they occur, 
and what brings them on, you can’t do much about changing them.
To illustrate problems with identifying feelings, we turn to Dr. Wolfe and her 
patient, Jim, who is struggling with his marriage.
The price of ignoring your feelings
In Gone with the Wind, Scarlet O’Hara says time 
and again, “I’ll think about that tomorrow. After 
all, tomorrow is another day.” What a nice, easy 
solution to tough times — shove the issue out 
of the way. But we’re discovering more about 
the costs of avoiding and repressing emotions.
According to researchers at Adelphi University 
and the University of Michigan, people who 
declare themselves as mentally healthy over 
the years when other evidence shows they’re 
not have higher heart rates and blood pres-
sure in response to stress than folks who own 
up to their emotional difficulties or those who 
truly don’t have problems at the time. Studies 
also show that when people write about their 
emotions on a daily basis, their immune system 
improves. Amazing stuff.

68
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
Dr. Wolfe: How did you feel when your wife said you were irresponsible?
Jim: I thought she was really out of line.
Dr. Wolfe: I see. But how did you feel about what she said?
Jim: She’s at least as irresponsible as I am.
Dr. Wolfe: I suppose that’s possible. But again, what were your feelings, 
your emotional reaction to what she said? Were you anxious, even angry, 
or upset?
Jim: Well, I couldn’t believe she could accuse me of that.
Dr. Wolfe: I wonder if we should take some time to help you get in touch 
with your feelings?
Perhaps Jim is extremely anxious and worried that his wife will leave him, or 
he may be angry with her. Maybe her stinging criticism hurt him. Whatever 
the feeling, both Jim and Dr. Wolfe could find out plenty from knowing what 
emotion accompanies his upset.
This example shows that people may not always know how to describe what 
they’re feeling. If you don’t always know what you’re feeling, that’s okay. We 
realize that some people are aware of their feelings and know all too well 
when they’re feeling the slightest amount of anxiety or worry. If you’re one of 
those, feel free to skip or skim the rest of this section.
If you need to become more aware of your feelings, you can start immedi-
ately. Take some time right now to assess your mood. First, notice your 
breathing. Is it rapid and shallow or slow and deep? Check your posture. 
Are you relaxed or is some part of your body in an uncomfortable position. 
Notice all your physical sensations. Tune in to sensations of tension, queasi-
ness, tightness, dizziness, or heaviness. No matter what you find, just sit with 
the sensations a while. Then ask yourself what feeling captures the essence 
of those sensations. Of course, at this moment, you may not have any strong 
feelings. If so, your breathing is rhythmic and your posture relaxed. Even 
if that’s the case, notice what it feels like to be calm. At other times, notice 
your stronger sensations.
 
Feeling words describe your physical and mental reaction to events.
The following vocabulary list describes anxious feelings. The next time you 
can’t find the right words to describe how you feel, one of these words may 
get you started.
Afraid
Agitated
Anxious
Apprehensive
Disturbed
Dread
Fearful
Frightened

69
 Chapter 5: Becoming a Thought Detective
We’re sure that we’ve missed a few dozen possibilities on the word list, and 
maybe you have a favorite way to describe your anxiety. That’s fine. What we 
encourage you to do is to start paying attention to your feelings and bodily 
sensations. You may want to look over this list a number of times and ask 
yourself whether you’ve felt any of these emotions recently. Try not to make 
judgments about your feelings. They may be trying to tell you something.
 
Bad feelings only cause problems when you feel bad chronically and repeat-
edly in the absence of a clear threat. Anxiety and fear also have a positive 
function: They alert your mind and body to danger and prepare you to 
respond (see Chapter 3 for more on the fight-or-flight concept). For example, 
if King Kong knocks on your door, adrenaline floods your body and mobilizes 
you to either fight or run like your life depends on it, because it does! That’s 
good for situations like that. But if you feel like King Kong is knocking on your 
door on a regular basis and he’s not even in the neighborhood, your anxious 
feelings cause you more harm than good.
 
Whether or not King Kong is knocking at your door, identifying anxious, fear-
ful, or worried feelings can help you deal with them far more effectively than 
avoiding them. When you know what’s going on, you can focus on what to do 
about your predicament more easily than you can when you’re sitting in the 
dark.
Getting in touch with your thoughts
Just as some people don’t have much idea about what they’re feeling, others 
have trouble knowing what they’re thinking when they’re anxious, worried, 
or stressed. Because thoughts have a powerful influence on feelings, psy-
chologists like to ask their clients what they were thinking when they started 
to feel upset. Sometimes, clients describe feelings rather than thoughts. For 
example, Dr. Baker had the following dialogue with Susan, a client who had 
severe anxiety:
Insecure
Intimidated
Jittery
Nervous
Obsessed
Out of it
Panicked
Scared
Self-conscious
Shaky
Tense
Terrified
Timid
Uneasy
Uptight
Worried

70
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
Dr. Baker: So when your supervisor reprimanded you, you said you felt 
panicked. What thoughts went through your mind?
Susan: Well, I just felt horrible. I couldn’t stand it.
Dr. Baker: I know; it must have felt really awful. But I’m curious about 
what thoughts went through your mind. What did you say to yourself 
about your supervisor’s comments?
Susan: I felt my heart pounding in my chest. I don’t think I really had any 
thoughts actually.
Dr. Baker: That’s possible. Sometimes our thoughts escape us for a 
while. But I wonder, if you think about it now, what did those comments 
mean to you? What did you think would happen?
Susan: I’m shaking right now just thinking about it.
As this example illustrates, people don’t always know what’s going on in their 
heads when they feel anxious. Sometimes you may not have clear, identifi-
able thoughts when you feel worried or stressed. That’s perfectly normal.
The challenge is to find out what the stressful event means to you. That will 
tell you what your thoughts are. Consider the prior example. Susan may have 
felt panicked because she feared losing her job, or she may have thought 
the supervisor’s criticism meant that she was incompetent. The boss’s repri-
mand may have also triggered memories of her abusive father. Knowing what 
thoughts stand behind the feelings can help both Dr. Baker and Susan plan 
the next step.
Tapping your triggers
 
You may not always know what’s going on in your mind when you feel anx-
ious. To figure it out, you need to first identify the situation that preceded your 
upset. Zero in on what had just transpired moments before your troublesome 
feelings. Perhaps you
 
✓ Opened your mail and found that your credit card balance had 
skyrocketed
 
✓ Heard someone say something that bothered you
 
✓ Read the deficiency notice from your child’s school
 
✓ Wondered why your partner was so late coming home
 
✓ Got on the scales and saw a number you didn’t like
 
✓ Noticed that your chest felt tight and your heart was racing for no clear 
reason
On the other hand, sometimes the anxiety-triggering event hasn’t even hap-
pened yet. You may be just sitting around and wham — an avalanche of anxi-
ety crashes through. Other people wake up at 4 a.m. with worries marching 

71
 Chapter 5: Becoming a Thought Detective
through their minds. What’s the trigger then? Well, it can be an image or 
a fear of all sorts of future events. See the following examples of anxiety-
triggering thoughts and images:
 
✓ I’ll never have enough money for retirement.
 
✓ Did I turn off the stove before I left the house?
 
✓ We’ll never finish writing this book on time!
 
✓ No one is going to like my speech tomorrow.
 
✓ What if I get laid off next week?
 
✓ What if my partner leaves me?
 
When you get upset or anxious, take a moment to reflect. Ask yourself what 
event just occurred or what thoughts or images floated into your mind just 
before you noticed the anxiety. Bingo! You’ll see what triggered your anxious 
feelings. After you see how to snare your anxious thoughts in the next section, 
we show you how to put thoughts and feelings all together.
Snaring your anxious thoughts
If you know your feelings and the triggers for those feelings, you’re ready to 
become a thought detective. Thoughts powerfully influence emotions. An event 
may serve as the trigger, but it isn’t what directly leads to your anxiety. It’s the 
meaning that the event holds for you, and your thoughts reflect that meaning.
For example, suppose your spouse is 45 minutes late coming home from 
work. You may think anxious thoughts:
 
✓ Maybe she’s had an accident.
 
✓ She’s probably having an affair.
Or you may have different thoughts that don’t cause so much anxiety:
 
✓ I love having time alone with the kids.
 
✓ I like having time alone to work on house projects.
 
✓ Traffic must be really bad tonight.
 
Some thoughts create anxiety; others feel good; and still others don’t stir up 
much feeling at all. Capturing your thoughts and seeing how they trigger anxi-
ety and connect to your feelings is important. If you’re not sure what thoughts 
are in your head when you’re anxious, you can do something to find them.
 
First, focus on the anxiety trigger — the event or image that seemed to set 
things off. Think about it for a while; don’t rush it. Then ask yourself some 
questions about the trigger. The following list of what we call minding-your-
mind questions can help you identify your thoughts or the meaning that the 
event holds for you:

72
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
 
✓ Specifically, what about this event do I find upsetting?
 
✓ What’s the worst that could happen?
 
✓ How might this event affect my life?
 
✓ How might this affect the way that others see me?
 
✓ Does this remind me of anything in my past that bothered me?
 
✓ What would my parents say about this event?
 
✓ How might this affect the way that I see myself?
Andrew’s story illustrates how the questions about a triggering event can 
help clarify the nature of how one’s thoughts influence feelings.
Andrew loves his work. He manages computer systems and designs Web 
pages for small businesses in his community. Andrew believes in hands-
on service and often visits his clients just to see whether things are run-
ning smoothly. One Friday, Andrew pulls up to one of the law firm offices 
he’s working for and sees three police cars parked by the front door. 
Andrew’s heart races, and he perspires profusely at the mere sight of 
police. He feels terrified, but doesn’t know for sure what he’s thinking.
In order to capture what’s going on in his head, he answers a few of the 
minding-your-mind questions:
 
✓ Specifically, what about this event do I find upsetting?
 
 Something violent may be going on. I’ve always been afraid of violence.
 
✓ How might this event affect my life?
 
 I could get killed.
 
✓ How might this affect the way that others see me?
 
 Other people will think I’m a foolish coward.
 
✓ How might this affect the way I see myself?
 
 Like the coward I’ve always thought I was.
Andrew merely saw three police cars in front of a law office. Can you 
see where his mind took this event? Although workplace violence does 
occur, many other interpretations of this event are actually more likely. 
Nevertheless, Andrew needs to know what thoughts are running through 
his head when he feels anxious if he’s going to be able to change how he 
responds to events like these.
 
When you work with the minding-your-mind questions, use your imagina-
tion. Brainstorm, and take your time. Even though Andrew’s example doesn’t 
answer all the questions, you may find it useful to do so.

73
 Chapter 5: Becoming a Thought Detective
Tracking Your Thoughts, 
Triggers, and Feelings
Monitoring your thoughts, feelings, and whatever triggers your anxiety paves 
the way for change. This simple strategy helps you focus on your personal 
pattern of stress and worry. The very act of paying attention brings your 
thinking process to light. This clarification helps you gain a new perspective.
Try using a thought-therapy chart like the one in Table 5-1 to connect your 
thoughts, feelings, and anxiety triggers. When you monitor the triggers, 
include the day, time, place, people involved, and what was going on. When 
you record your anxious thoughts, use the minding-your-mind questions in 
the “Snaring your anxious thoughts” section earlier in this chapter. Finally, 
write down your anxious feelings and physical sensations, and rate the sever-
ity of those feelings. Use 1 to represent almost no anxiety at all and 100 to 
indicate the most severe anxiety imaginable (sort of like how you might feel if 
100 rattlesnakes suddenly appeared slithering around your bedroom!).
To show you how to use the chart, we’ve filled it in with Andrew’s notes that 
he took for a few days after starting therapy for his anxiety about violence.

You can use this simple technique to monitor your anxious feelings, thoughts, 
and triggers. Simply design your own thought-therapy chart using the head-
ings of Table 5-1. Keep track, and look for patterns. Sometimes, just becoming 
more aware of your feelings, thoughts, and triggers can reduce your anxiety.

If recording your thoughts, feelings, and triggers makes you more anxious, 
that’s okay. It’s common. Many other techniques in this book should help, 
especially the ones for challenging your thoughts in this chapter. But if the 
techniques in this book don’t help you, consider seeking professional help.
Although monitoring may produce useful insights that reduce your anxiety a 
bit, you, like most people, may need a little more assistance. The next section 
shows you how to tackle your anxious thoughts and make them manageable.
Tackling Your Thoughts: Thought Therapy
When you’ve snared what your anxious thoughts are on paper, you’re ready 
for the next steps. In fact, we have three simple strategies for tackling your 
anxious thoughts:
 
✓ Going to thought court: Taking your thoughts to court and sifting 
through the evidence.
 
✓ Rethinking risk: Recalculating the odds of your anxious thoughts 
coming true — most people overestimate the odds.
 
✓ Imagining worst-case scenarios: Reexamining your ability to cope — if, 
in fact, the worst does occur. Most folks underestimate their coping 
resources.
Tracking anxious thoughts and events is an important step in arresting anxi-
ety. But thought therapy takes those arrested thoughts, books them, takes 
them to trial, and throws them into jail. We show you how in the following 
sections.
Weighing the evidence: Thought court
The thoughts that lead to your anxious feelings have most likely been around 
a long time. Most people consider their thoughts to be true. They don’t ques-
tion them. You may be surprised to discover that many of your thoughts 
don’t hold up under scrutiny. If you carefully gather and weigh the evidence, 
you just may find that your thoughts rest on a foundation of sand.
 
Keep in mind that gathering evidence when you’re feeling really anxious isn’t 
always easy to do. At those times, it’s hard to consider that your thoughts 
may be inaccurate. When that’s the case, you’re better off waiting until you 
calm down before hunting for the evidence. At other times, you may be able to 
find evidence right away if your anxiety isn’t too out of control.

 Chapter 5: Becoming a Thought Detective
 
You can evaluate the validity of your thoughts by first jotting down an anxiety-
arousing thought that you take from the thought-therapy chart that we describe 
how to create in the earlier section “Tracking Your Thoughts, Triggers, and 
Feelings.” Then, collect evidence that either supports the likelihood of your 
thought being true or disputes the likelihood of your anxious thought being 
true. Use the following questions to come up with disputing evidence:
 
✓ Have I had thoughts like these at other times in my life? Have my dire 
predictions come true?
 
✓ Do I have experiences that would contradict my thoughts in any way?
 
✓ Is this situation really as awful as I’m making it out to be?
 
✓ A year from now, how much concern will I have with this issue?
 
✓ Am I thinking this will happen just because I’m feeling anxious and wor-
ried? Am I basing my conclusion mostly on my feelings or on the true 
evidence?
 
✓ Am I assuming something without any solid evidence for my negative 
thought?
 
Feelings are always valid in the sense that you feel what you feel, but they’re 
not evidence for supporting anxious thoughts. For example, if you feel 
extremely anxious about taking a test, the anxiety is not evidence of how you 
will perform.
These evidence-gathering questions can help you discover evidence against 
your anxious or worrisome thoughts, because an anxious mind already 
knows the evidence that supports anxious thoughts.
To see how this works, take a look at Andrew’s notes in Table 5-2. Andrew 
was afraid that someone would hurt him and jumped to conclusions without 
evidence to support those conclusions. First, Andrew filled out the evidence 
supporting his anxious thought, which he found easy to do. Then he used the 
evidence-gathering questions in this section to list the evidence against his 
anxious thoughts in the second column of the table.

Part II: Battling Anxiety 
Table 5-2 (continued)
Evidence Supporting My Anxious 
Thoughts
Evidence Against My Anxious 
Thoughts
It’s dark out here. 
I’ve walked in the dark hundreds of 
times without getting mugged. 
My parents always warned me about 
the dangers in the world. 
I have no real evidence that this park-
ing lot is dangerous; after all, it’s a 
good neighborhood! 
I feel weak and vulnerable. 
Just because I feel something doesn’t 
make it true. 
After completing the task, Andrew makes a new judgment about his anx-
ious thought. He realizes that the evidence supporting his anxious thought 
doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. He understands that his fears exceed the actual 
risks involved. He decides to take a self-defense class but to let go of his con-
stant high state of alert (what shrinks call hypervigilance).
 
Consider filling out your own chart so that you can weigh the evidence care-
fully. Use the same column headings and format shown in Table 5-2. Be 
creative and come up with as much evidence for and against your anxious 
thoughts as you can.
 
Don’t forget to use the evidence-gathering questions listed earlier in this 
section if you need help generating ideas.
Make a decision as to whether you truly think your anxious thoughts hold 
water. If they don’t, you just may start taking them less seriously, and your 
anxiety could drop a notch or two.
 
Although charting your anxious thoughts and weighing the evidence just once 
may prove to be helpful, practice magnifies the effect. Mastering any new skill 
always requires practice. The longer you stay at it and the more times you 
chart your anxious thoughts versus the real evidence, the more benefit you’ll 
gain. Many of our clients find that charting these out regularly for three or four 
months alleviates a considerable amount of their negative feelings.
Rethinking risk
Another important way to challenge your anxious thoughts is to look at how 
you assess the likelihood that an event may occur. When you feel anxious, 
like many people, you may overestimate the odds of unwanted events actually 
occurring. It’s easy to do. For example, when was the last time you heard a 
news bulletin reporting that no one got bitten by a snake that day, or that 
half a million airplanes took off and landed and not a single one crashed? No 

77
 Chapter 5: Becoming a Thought Detective
wonder people overestimate disaster. Because disasters grab our attention, 
we focus on dramatic events rather than routine ones. That’s why it’s useful 
to think about the real, objective odds of your predicted catastrophe.
 
Thoughts are just thoughts. Subject them to a reality test.
 
When you find yourself making negative predictions about the future — such 
as the horrible time you’ll have at a party, your odds of failing a test, or the 
likelihood that you’ll end up in financial ruin — ask yourself the following reas-
sessment of risk questions:
 
✓ How many times have I predicted this outcome, and how many times 
has it actually happened to me?
 
✓ How often does this happen to people I know?
 
✓ If someone I know made this prediction, would I agree?
 
✓ Am I assuming this will happen just because I fear that it will, or is there 
a reasonable chance that it will really happen?
 
✓ Would people pay me to predict the future?
 
✓ Do I have any experiences from my past that would suggest my dire pre-
diction is unlikely to occur?
In addition to asking these questions, whenever possible, look up the statisti-
cal evidence as it relates to your fears. Of course, you can’t always find sta-
tistics that help you. Nevertheless, the answers to the preceding questions 
will help you reassess your true risk and stop habitually making catastrophic 
predictions about the future.
What are the odds?
On any given day, the odds of being struck by 
lightning are about 1 in 250 million, and the life-
time odds of being killed by a few other means 
are as follows:
 ✓ By a dog: About 1 in 700,000
 ✓ By a poisonous snake, lizard, or spider: 
About 1 in 700,000
 ✓ In air or space transport: About 1 in 5,000
 ✓ By a firearm: About 1 in 202
 ✓ In an auto accident: About 1 in 81
Notice how the actual odds don’t match very 
well with what people fear most. Many more 
people fear thunderstorms, snakes, spiders, 
and flying in airplanes than driving a car or 
being killed by a firearm. It doesn’t make a lot of 
sense, does it? Finally, we should note that your 
individual odds may vary. If you regularly stand 
outside during thunderstorms, holding your golf 
clubs in the air, your chances of being struck by 
lightning are a little higher than average.

Part II: Battling Anxiety 
The following story shows how Dennis overestimates the probability of a hor-
rible outcome.
Dennis rudely grabs the pan from his wife, Linda. He snaps at her, “I’ll finish 
browning the meat. Go ahead and set the table.” His abrupt demeanor 
stings Linda’s feelings, but she knows how anxious he gets when company 
comes over for dinner. Dennis tightly grips the pan over the stove, watch-
ing the color of the meat carefully. He feels irritable and anxious, “knowing” 
that the dinner will turn out badly. He frets that the meat is too tough and 
that the vegetables look soggy from overcooking. The stress is contagious, 
and by the time the company arrives, Linda shares his worries.
What outcome does Dennis predict? Almost every time that he and Linda 
entertain, Dennis believes that the food they prepare will be terrible, their 
guests will be horrified, and he’ll be humiliated. The odds of this outcome 
can’t be looked up in a table or a book. So how can Dennis assess the odds 
realistically? Naturally, he answers the reassessment of risk questions and 
starts to change his anxious thoughts.
In doing so, Dennis comes to realize that he and his wife have never actu-
ally ruined a dinner, although he has predicted it numerous times before. 
Furthermore, he tested his second prediction that his guests would feel hor-
rified if the dinner did turn out badly. He recalled that one time he and Linda 
attended a barbeque where the meat was burned to the extent that it was 
inedible. Everyone expressed genuine sympathy and shared stories about 
their own cooking disasters. They ended up ordering pizza and considered it 
one of the more enjoyable evenings they’d spent in a long time. The hosts, far 
from humiliated, basked in the glow of goodwill.
Deconstructing worrisome scenarios
Even faced with the evidence of the unlikelihood of the events you fear 
happening, you may be thinking that bad things still do, in fact, happen. 
Lightning strikes. Bosses hand out bad evaluations. Airplanes crash. Some 
days are just “bad hair days.” Ships sink. People stumble and get laughed at. 
Some lose their jobs. Lovers break up.
The world gives us plenty of reasons to worry. Recalculating the true odds 
often helps. But you may still be stuck with the what-if worry — what if your 
concern truly happens? First we show you how to cope with smaller, every-
day worries, and then we address worst-case scenarios.
Small-potatoes scenarios
What do people worry about? Most of the time they worry about inconsequen-
tial, small-potatoes scenarios. In other words, outcomes that, while unpleasant, 

79
 Chapter 5: Becoming a Thought Detective
hardly qualify as life threatening. Nevertheless, these small scenarios manage 
to generate remarkable amounts of stress, apprehension, and worry.
Listen to what’s worrying Gerald, Sammy, and Carol. Their stories illustrate 
common concerns that lead people to feel highly anxious.
Gerald worries about many things. Mostly, he worries about committing 
a social blunder. Before parties, he obsesses over what to wear. Will he 
look too dressed up or too casual? Will he know what to say? What if he 
says something stupid and people laugh? As you can imagine, Gerald 
feels miserable at social events. When he walks into a crowd, he feels as 
though a spotlight has turned his way and everyone in the room is star-
ing at him. He imagines that people not only focus on him but that they 
also judge him negatively.
Sammy worries as much as Gerald; he just has a different set of wor-
ries. Sammy obsesses over the idea that he’ll lose control and have to 
run away from wherever he is. If he’s sitting in a classroom, he wonders 
whether he’ll get so anxious that he’ll have to leave, and of course, he 
assumes everyone will know why he left and think something is terribly 
wrong with him. If he’s at a crowded shopping mall, he’s afraid he’ll “lose 
it” and start screaming and running out of control.
Carol is a journalist. She feels anxiety almost every day. She feels pres-
sure in her chest when each deadline approaches and dreads the day 
when she fails to get her story in on time. Making matters worse, she 
sometimes has writer’s block and can’t think of the next word to type 
for 15 or 20 minutes; all the while, the clock advances and the deadline 
nears. She’s seen colleagues lose their jobs when they consistently failed 
to reach their deadlines, and she fears meeting the same fate one day. It’s 
hard for Carol to stop thinking about her deadlines.
What do Gerald, Sammy, and Carol have in common? First, they all have con-
siderable anxiety, stress, and tension. They worry almost every single day 
of their lives. They can’t imagine the horror of dealing with the possibility of 
their fears coming true. But, more importantly, they worry about events that 
happen all the time and that people manage to cope with when they do.
Gerald, Sammy, and Carol all underestimate their own ability to cope. What 
if Gerald spills something at a party and people around him notice? Would 
Gerald fall to the floor unable to move? Would people point and laugh at him? 
Not likely. He’d probably blush, feel embarrassed, and clean up the mess. 
The party and Gerald’s life would go on. Even if a few rude people laughed 
at Gerald, most would forget the incident and certainly wouldn’t view Gerald 
any differently.

80
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
Sammy panics over the possibility that his feelings may overwhelm him. He 
worries that he’ll have to run from wherever he is and look foolish in doing 
so. The fact that this has never happened to him doesn’t stop Sammy’s 
worrying.
Carol, on the other hand, has a bigger worry. Her worst-case scenario involves 
losing her job. That sounds serious. What would she do if she lost her job?
 
Whether you experience small- or medium-sized worries (small- or medium-
potato scenarios), you can use the following coping questions to discover your 
true ability to cope. The answers to these questions help you deal with your 
own worst fears.
 
1. Have I ever dealt with anything like this in the past?
 
2. How much will this affect my life a year from now?
 
3. Do I know people who’ve coped with something like this, and how did 
they do it?
 
4. Do I know anyone I could turn to for help or support?
 
5. Can I think of a creative new possibility that could result from this 
challenge?
Carol, who worried about losing her job, turns to these questions to help her 
come to terms with her fears. Carol writes these answers to the coping ques-
tions:
 
1. Have I ever dealt with anything like this in the past?
 
 No, I’ve never lost a job before. This first question doesn’t help me dis-
cover any better ways of coping, but it does help me see the possibility 
that I’ve been overestimating the risks of losing my job.
 
2. How much will this affect my life a year from now?
 
 If I did lose my job, I’d probably have some financial problems for a 
while, but I’m sure I could find another job.
 
3. Do I know people who’ve coped with something like this, and how did 
they do it?
 
 Well, my friend Janet lost her job a few months ago. Janet got unemploy-
ment checks and asked her parents for a little assistance. Now she has a 
new job that she really likes.
 
4. Do I know anyone I could turn to for help or support?
 
 I’d hate to do it, but my brother would always help me out if I really 
needed it.
 
5. Can I think of a creative new possibility that could result from this 
challenge?

81
 Chapter 5: Becoming a Thought Detective
 
 When I think about it, I really sort of hate these daily deadlines at the 
newspaper. I do have a teaching certificate. What with the shortage of 
teachers right now, I could always teach high school English and have 
summers off. Best of all, I could use those summers to write the novel 
I’ve always dreamed about writing. Maybe I’ll quit my job now and do 
that!
It’s amazing how often asking yourself these questions can eliminate the cata-
strophic consequences you associate with your imagined worry scenarios. 
Answering these questions can help you see that you can deal with the vast 
majority of your worries — at least the small- to medium-sized potatoes. But 
how about the worst-case scenarios (the really, really big potatoes)? Could 
you cope with real disasters?
Worst-case scenarios
Some peoples’ fears involve issues that go way beyond social embarrassment 
or temporary financial loss. Severe illness, death, terror, natural disasters, 
disfigurement, major disabilities, and loss of a loved one are worst-case sce-
narios. How would you possibly cope with one of these? We’re not going to 
tell you it would be easy, because it wouldn’t be.
Marilyn’s mother and grandmother both died of breast cancer. She 
knows her odds of getting breast cancer are higher than most. Almost 
every day of her adult life, she worries about her health. She insists on 
monthly checkups, and every stomach upset, bout of fatigue, or head-
ache becomes an imagined tumor.
Her stress concerns both her family and her physician. First, her doctor 
helps her see that she is overestimating her risk. Unlike her mother and 
grandmother, Marilyn goes for yearly mammograms, and she performs 
regular self-exams. Not only that, she exercises regularly and eats a much 
healthier diet than her mother or grandmother did.
Marilyn realistically has a chance of getting breast cancer. How would she 
possibly cope with this worst-case scenario? You may be surprised to dis-
cover that the same questions used to deal with the small-potatoes scenarios 
can help you deal with the worst-case scenarios. Take a look at how Marilyn 
answered our five coping questions:
 
1. Have I ever dealt with anything like this in the past?
 
 Unfortunately, yes. I helped my mother when she was going for chemo-
therapy. It was horrible, but I do remember laughing with her when her 
hair fell out. I understand chemotherapy isn’t nearly as bad as it used to 
be. I never felt closer to my mother than during that time. We talked out 
many important issues.
 
2. How much will this affect my life a year from now?

82
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
 
 Well, if I do get breast cancer, it will have a dramatic affect on my life a 
year from now. I may still be in treatment or recovering from surgery.
These first two questions focus Marilyn on the possibility of getting cancer. 
Even though she obsesses and worries about cancer, the intensity of the 
anxiety has prevented her from ever contemplating how she would deal with 
cancer if it actually occurred. Although she certainly hates the thought of 
chemotherapy or surgery, after she imagines the possibility, she realizes she 
could probably cope with them.
 
The more you avoid a fear, the more terrifying it becomes.
 
3. Do I know people who’ve coped with something like this, and how did 
they do it?
 
 Of course, my mother died of breast cancer. But during the last three 
years of her life, she enjoyed each moment. She got closer to all her kids 
and made many new friends. It’s funny, but now that I think about it, I 
think she was happier during that time than any other time I can remem-
ber.
 
4. Do I know anyone I could turn to for help or support?
 
 I know of a cancer support group in town. And my husband and sister 
would do anything for me.
 
5. Can I think of a creative new possibility that could result from this 
challenge?
 
 I never thought of cancer as a challenge; it was a curse. But I guess I 
realize now that I can choose to be anxious and worried about it or just 
take care of myself and live life fully. If I do get cancer, I can hopefully 
help others like my mother did, and I’ll use the time I have in a positive 
way. Besides, there’s a good chance that I could beat cancer, and with 
medical advances, those chances improve all the time. Meanwhile, I’m 
going to make sure that I don’t wait until my final days to get close to my 
family.
 
When you have anxiety about something dreadful happening, it’s important to 
stop avoiding the end of the story. Go there. The more you avoid contemplat-
ing the worst, the bigger the fear gets. In our work, we repeatedly find that our 
clients come up with coping strategies for the worst-case scenario, even the 
big stuff. Consider George’s case.
George fears flying. He recalculates the risks of flying and realizes they’re 
low. He says, “I know it’s relatively safe and that helps a little, but it still 
scares me.” Recently, George got a promotion. Unfortunately for George, 
the new position requires considerable travel. George’s worst nightmare 
is that the plane will crash. George asks himself our coping questions and 
answers them as follows:

83
 Chapter 5: Becoming a Thought Detective
 
1. Have I ever dealt with anything like this in the past?
 
 No, I’ve obviously never been in a plane crash before.
 
2. How much will this affect my life a year from now?
 
 Not much, I’d be dead!
 
3. Do I know people who’ve coped with something like this, and how did 
they do it?
 
 No. None of my friends, relatives, or acquaintances has ever been in a 
plane crash.
 
4. Do I know anyone I could turn to for help or support?
 
 Obviously not. I mean, what could they do?
 
5. Can I think of a creative new possibility that could result from this 
challenge?
 
 How? In the few minutes I’d have on the way down, it’s doubtful that 
many creative possibilities would occur to me.
Hmm. George didn’t seem to get much out of our coping questions, did he? 
These questions don’t do much good for a small number of worst-case sce-
narios. For those situations, we have the ultimate coping questions, followed 
by George’s responses to these questions:
 
1. What is it about this eventuality that makes you think you absolutely 
could not cope and could not possibly stand it?
 
 Okay, I can imagine two different plane crashes. In one, the plane would 
explode and I probably wouldn’t even know what happened. In the 
other, something would happen to the engine, and I’d experience several 
minutes of absolute terror. That’s what I really fear.
 
2. Is it possible that you really could deal with it?
 
 Could I deal with that? I guess I never thought of that before; it seemed 
too scary to contemplate. If I really put myself in the plane, I’d probably 
be gripping the seat, maybe even screaming, but I guess it wouldn’t last 
for long. I suppose I could stand almost anything for a short while. At 
least if I went down in a plane, I know my family would be well taken 
care of. When I really think about it, as unpleasant as it seems, I guess I 
could deal with it. I’d have to.
Most people fear dying to some extent — even those with strong religious 
convictions (which can help) rarely welcome the thought. Nevertheless, 
death is a universal experience. Although most people would prefer a pain-
less, quick exit during sleep, many deaths aren’t as easy.

84
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
If a particular way of dying frightens you, actively contemplating it works 
better than trying to block it out of your mind. If you do this, you’re likely 
to discover that, like George, you can deal with and accept almost any 
eventuality.
 
If you find yourself getting exceptionally anxious or upset by such contempla-
tion, professional help may be useful.
Cultivating Calm Thinking
Anxious thoughts capture your attention. They hold your reasonable mind 
hostage. They demand all your calmness and serenity as ransom. Thus, when 
you have anxious thoughts, it helps to pursue and destroy them by weighing 
the evidence, reassessing the odds, and reviewing your true ability to cope 
(see the previous sections for the how-tos).
Another option is to crowd out your anxious thoughts with calm thoughts. 
You can accomplish this task by using one of three techniques. You can try 
what we call the friend perspective; you can construct new, calm thoughts to 
replace your old, anxious thoughts; or you can try positive affirmations.
Considering a “friend’s” perspective
Sometimes, simple strategies work wonders. This can be one of them. When 
your anxious thoughts hold most of your reasonable mind hostage, you still 
have a friend in reserve who can help you find a fresh perspective. Where? 
Within yourself.
 
Try this technique when you’re all alone — alone, that is, except for your 
friend within. Truly imagine that a good friend is sitting across from you and 
talk out loud. Imagine that your friend has exactly the same problem that you 
do. Take your time, and really try to help your friend. Brainstorm with your 
friend. You don’t have to come up with instant or perfect solutions. Seek out 
every idea you can, even if it sounds foolish at first — it just may lead you to 
a creative solution. This approach works because it helps you pull back from 
the overwhelming emotions that block good, reasonable thinking. Don’t dis-
miss this strategy just because of its simplicity!
Juan’s example demonstrates this technique in action.
Juan worries about his bills. He has a charge card balance of a few thou-
sand dollars. His car insurance comes due in a couple of weeks, and 

85
 Chapter 5: Becoming a Thought Detective
he doesn’t have the money to pay for it. When Juan contemplates his 
worry, he thinks that maybe he’ll go broke, his car will be repossessed, 
and eventually, he’ll lose his house. He feels he has no options and that 
his situation is hopeless. Juan loses sleep because of his worry. Anxiety 
shuts down his ability to reason and analyze his dilemma.
Now, we ask Juan to help an old friend. We tell him to imagine Richard, 
a friend of his, is sitting in a chair across from him. His friend is in a 
financial bind and needs advice on what to do. Richard fears he will lose 
everything if he can’t come up with some money to pay his car insurance. 
We ask Juan to come up with some ideas for Richard.
Surprising to Juan, but not to us, he comes up with a cornucopia of good 
ideas. He tells Richard, “Talk to your insurance agent about making 
payments monthly rather than every six months. Also, you can get an 
advance on your credit card. Furthermore, isn’t there an opportunity 
to do some overtime work? Talk to a credit counselor. Couldn’t one 
of your relatives loan you a few hundred dollars? In the long run, you 
need to chip away at that credit-card debt and pull back a little on your 
spending.”
Creating calm
Another way to create calm thoughts is to look at your anxious thoughts and 
develop a more reasonable perspective. The key with this approach is to put 
it on paper. Leaving it in your head doesn’t do nearly as much good.
This strategy doesn’t equate with mere positive thinking, because it doesn’t 
help you create a Pollyanna alternative — that is, a thought that is unrealisti-
cally optimistic. Be sure that your reasonable perspective is something that 
you can at least partially believe in. In other words, your emotional side may 
not fully buy into your alternative view at first, but the new view should be 
something that a reasonable person would find believable.
 
Your task will be easier if you’ve already subjected your anxious thinking 
to weighing the evidence, rethinking the risk, and reevaluating your coping 
resources for dealing with your imagined worst-case scenarios, as we describe 
in earlier sections.
Table 5-3 provides some examples of anxious thoughts and their reasonable 
alternatives. We also provide you with a Pollyanna perspective that we don’t 
think is useful.

If I wear a tie and no one 
else does, I’ll look like an 
idiot.
If no one else wears a tie, 
some people will no doubt 
notice. However, they prob-
ably won’t make a big deal 
out of it. Even if a couple of 
people do, it really won’t 
matter to me at all a few 
weeks from now.
Everyone will 
think I look great 
no matter what!
If I get a C on this exam, 
I’ll be humiliated. I have 
to be at the top of my 
class. I couldn’t stand it if 
I wasn’t.
If I get a C, I certainly won’t 
be happy. But I’ll still have a 
good grade average and a 
good chance at a scholarship. 
I’ll just work harder the next 
time. I’d love to be at the top 
of my class, but life will go on 
just fine if I fall short of that.
There’s no way 
that I won’t get 
an A. I must, and 
I shall.
If I lose my job, in a matter 
of weeks I’ll be bankrupt.
If I lose my job, it will cause 
some hardship. However, 
odds are good I’ll find another 
one. And my wife has offered 
to increase her hours to help 
out if I need her to.
I could never 
lose my job!
I’d rather walk up 20 
flights of stairs than take 
this elevator. The thought 
of the doors closing terri-
fies me.
It’s time I tackled this fear, 
because the odds of an eleva-
tor crash are infinitesimally 
small. Taking the elevator is 
pretty scary, but perhaps I 
can start by just riding up or 
down a couple of floors and 
work my way on from there.
I need to quit 
being such a 
wimp. I’m just 
going to jump 
on this thing and 
take it to the top!
 
We showed you the Pollyanna perspective because it’s important not to go 
there. You may think the last example of the Pollyanna perspective — getting 
over your fear in an instant — looks great. That would be nice, we suppose, 
if only it worked that way. The problem with that approach is that you set 
yourself up for failure if you try it. Imagine someone truly terrified of eleva-
tors trying to jump on and take it to the top floor all at once. More likely than 
not, the person would do it that one time, feel horror, and make the fear even 
worse.

87
 Chapter 5: Becoming a Thought Detective
 
Be gentle with yourself; go slowly when confronting your anxious thoughts 
and fears.
Affirming affirmations?
The field of mental health has a long tradition of advocating that people use 
affirmations to improve their emotional well-being. Stuart Smalley, a charac-
ter played by Al Franken on Saturday Night Live, used to look in the mirror 
and say, “I’m good enough; I’m smart enough; and doggone it, people like 
me.” Does this approach for managing emotions really help?
 
Many people swear by the value of positive self-affirmations. However, a 2009 
study reported in the journal Psychological Science suggests that positive 
affirmations may actually cause harm to some people. Although the doctors 
who conducted the study found that people with high self-esteem seem to feel 
better after repeating positive self-affirmations, those with low self-esteem 
reported actually feeling worse after doing so. This result may be due to the 
fact that positive self-affirmations feel unbelievable and out of contact with 
reality to people with really low opinions of themselves.
So, if you’re tempted to use positive self-affirmations, we recommend that 
you make sure you design statements that feel reasonably believable to you. 
Good statements often include reminders to cope or calm down. Some of our 
favorites include:
 
✓ Relax.
 
✓ With time, I can get through this.
 
✓ I need to keep at this.
 
✓ I don’t have to be perfect.
 
✓ Mistakes are not awful.
 
✓ Breathe in and out very slowly.
 
✓ Next year (or next month), this won’t matter.
 
Repetition does help information sink in and feel like part of you. Be sure that 
whatever you repeat to yourself feels reasonable to you.

Chapter 6
Watching Out for Worry Words
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing anxiety-arousing words
▶ Understanding how language creates anxiety
▶ Tracking worrisome words
▶ Substituting calm phrases
T
hink about the mental chatter that goes on in your mind. Do you ever 
exaggerate? Put yourself down? Predict horrible outcomes? For example, 
if your computer is acting up, do you get angry at yourself, predict that you’ll 
never get anything done, and surmise that the day will surely be ruined? 
Those inner conversations can stir up a whirlwind of anxiety.
This chapter helps you discover what words contribute to your anxiety. 
They come in several forms and categories, and we show you how to track 
these words down. Then we offer strategies for finding alternative words and 
phrases to quell your unnecessary anxiety.
Stacking Sticks into Bonfires of Anxiety
“Sticks and stones can break my bones, but words can never hurt me.” 
Perhaps you heard this saying as a child. Parents often try to assuage their 
kids’ hurt feelings through this catchphrase, but it usually doesn’t work 
because words do have power. Words can frighten, judge, and hurt.
If those words came only from other people, that would hurt enough. But the 
words that you use to describe yourself, your world, your actions, and your 
future may have an even greater impact on you than what you hear from 
others. The example of Jason and his wife Beverly illustrates this point. What 
starts out as a simple conversation between husband and wife leads to lots of 
anxiety and marital stress.

90
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
Jason’s wife Beverly, who’s a little worried about her husband’s blood 
pressure, mentions at breakfast that it looks like he’s gained a little 
weight. “Oh, really?” Jason queries.
“Maybe just a little bit; it’s no big deal. I just worry about your health,” 
she replies.
Over the course of the next few hours, Jason starts ruminating about 
what his wife said. “I’m a pig . . . She’s totally disgusted with me . . . She’ll 
never want to have sex with me again . . . Losing weight is impossible for 
me . . . I’m certain that she’ll leave me; that would be unbearable.”
By the afternoon, Jason feels intense anxiety and tension. He’s so upset 
that he withdraws and sulks through the rest of the day. Beverly knows 
something’s wrong and worries that Jason is losing interest in her.
What happened? First, Beverly delivered a fairly mild statement to Jason. 
Then, rather than ask Beverly for clarification, Jason pounded himself with 
a slurry of anxiety-arousing words — pig, totally disgusted, never, impossible, 
certain, and unbearable. Jason’s mind overflowed with powerful words that 
grossly distorted Beverly’s original intention. His inner thoughts no longer 
had any connection to reality.
 
The worry words that you use inflame anxiety easily and are rarely supported 
by evidence or reality. They become bad habits that people use unwittingly. 
However, we have good news: Like any habit, the anxiety-arousing word habit 
can be broken.
Worry words come in four major categories. In the upcoming sections, we go 
through each of them with you carefully:
 
✓ Extremist: Words that exaggerate or turn a minor event into a 
catastrophe
 
✓ All-or-none: Polar opposites with nothing in between
 
✓ Judging, commanding, and labeling: Stern evaluations and 
name-calling
 
✓ Victim: Underestimating your ability to cope
Encountering extremist words
It’s amazing how selecting certain words to describe events can literally 
make mountains out of molehills. Extremist words grossly magnify or exag-
gerate troubling situations. In doing so, they aggravate negative emotions. 
Read about Emily, who turns a fender bender into a catastrophe.

91
 Chapter 6: Watching Out for Worry Words
Emily, pulling out of a tight parking spot at the grocery store, hears 
metal scraping metal. Her bumper dents a side panel of a late-model SUV 
parked next to her. Emily stomps on the brake, jams her car into park, 
and leaps out to inspect the damage — a 4-inch gash.
Using her cellphone, she calls her husband, Ron. Hysterical, she cries, 
“There’s been a horrible accident. I destroyed the other car. I feel awful; I 
just can’t stand it.” Ron attempts to calm his wife and rushes to the scene 
from work. When he arrives, he’s not that surprised to find the damage to 
be quite minor. He’s well aware of Emily’s habit of using extreme words, 
but that doesn’t mean Emily isn’t upset. She is. Neither she nor Ron real-
izes how Emily’s language lights the fuse for her emotional response.
Most of Emily’s problematic language falls under the category of extremist 
words. The following list gives you a small sample of extremist words: agoniz-
ing, appalling, awful, devastating, disastrous, horrible, and unbearable.
Of course, reality can be horrible, appalling, and downright awful. It would 
be hard to describe the Holocaust, September 11th, famine, or a worldwide 
pandemic in milder terms. However, all too often, extremist words like these 
reshape reality. Think about how many times you or the people you know 
use these words to describe events that, while certainly unpleasant, can 
hardly be described as earth-shattering.
 
Life presents challenges. Loss, frustration, aggravation, and pain routinely 
drop in like annoying, unwelcome guests. You may try to banish them from 
your life, but your best efforts won’t keep them from stopping by — uninvited 
as usual. When they arrive, you have two choices. One is to magnify them 
and tell yourself how horrible, awful, unbearable, and intolerable they are. But 
when you do that, you only manage to intensify your anxiety and distress. 
Your other option is to think in more realistic terms. (See the “Exorcising your 
extremist words” section, later in this chapter, for more on realistic options.)
Misrepresenting with all-or-none, 
black-or-white words
Pick up any black-and-white photograph. Look carefully, and you’ll see many 
shades of gray that likely dominate the picture. Most photos contain very 
little pure black or white at all. Calling a photo black-and-white oversimplifies 
and fails to capture the complexity and richness of the image. Just as calling 
a photograph black-and-white leaves out many of the details, describing an 
event in black-and-white terms ignores the full range of human experience. 
Like a photograph, little of life is black or white.

92
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
Nevertheless, people easily slip into language that oversimplifies. Like 
extremist language, this all-or-nothing approach intensifies negative feelings. 
The following example shows how categorizing life in all-or-nothing terms can 
lead to upset feelings.
Thomas puts his newspaper down, unable to concentrate, and tells his 
wife that he’d better get going. “I didn’t sleep a wink last night. I’ve been 
totally freaked about my sales quota this month. I’ll never make it. There’s 
absolutely no way. Sales entirely dried up with the slower economy, but 
the boss has zero tolerance for extenuating circumstances. I’m certain 
he’s going to jump my case. It would be absolutely impossible to find 
another job if he fires me.”
Thomas distorts reality by declaring that he’ll never make the sales quota. 
Then his anxiety escalates. In the process, he concentrates on the negative 
rather than searching for positive solutions. If Thomas is at a loss for addi-
tional all-or-none words, he can borrow from the following list: all, always, 
ceaseless, complete, constant, everyone, forever, invariably, no one, none . . . 
you get the idea.
 
Few things (other than death, taxes, and change) occur with absolute cer-
tainty. You may recall pleading with your parents for a later curfew. We bet 
you told them that everyone stays out later than you. If so, you did it for good 
reason, hoping that the word everyone would make a more powerful state-
ment. Nevertheless, your parents probably saw right through your ploy. 
Everyone oversimplifies sometimes; our language has many words for distort-
ing reality. (For an all-or-none antidote, see the “Disputing all-or-none” section 
later in this chapter.)
Running into judging words
You must read this book more carefully than you have been. Not only that, 
but you should have read more of it by now. And you should have taken the 
exercises more seriously. You’re a pathetic jerk. Shame on you!
We’re just kidding.
What authors in the world would take their readers to task like that? None 
that we can think of. That sort of criticism is abusive. People react with 
dismay when they witness parents humiliating their children by calling them 
stupid or rotten. Many would view a teacher who calls his students fools and 
describes their best effort as awful or pathetic as equally abusive. That kind 
of harsh judgment hardly inspires; berating crushes the will.
However, many people talk to themselves this way or even worse. Some hear 
a steady stream of critical commentary running through their minds. You 

93
 Chapter 6: Watching Out for Worry Words
may be your own worst critic. Many folks take the critical voice that they 
heard in childhood and turn it on themselves, often magnifying the critique 
in the process. Critical words come in three varieties, although they overlap, 
and sometimes a particular word can belong in more than one category:
 
✓ Judgments: These are harsh judgments about yourself or what you 
do. For example, when you make a human mistake and call it an utter 
failure, you’re judging your actions rather than merely describing them. 
Words like bad, inadequate, stupid, pathetic, or despicable are judgments.
 
✓ Commandments: This category contains words that dictate absolute, 
unyielding rules about your behavior or feelings. If you tell yourself that 
you should or must take a particular action, you’re listening to an inter-
nal drill sergeant. This punishing drill sergeant tolerates no deviation 
from a strict set of rules.
 
✓ Labels: Finally, self-critical labels put the icing on the cake. Words like 
loser, pig, monster, jerk, and failure come to mind as disturbing labels 
people sometimes put on themselves like a name tag worn at a party.
Consider Steve, who makes a minor mistake in his checkbook and launches 
into a self-critical tirade.
Steve, balancing his checkbook, discovers that he neglected to enter a 
check a few days ago. Fretting and worrying about the possibility that 
the check he wrote will bounce, Steve thinks, “I should be more careful. 
It’s pathetic that someone with a master’s degree could do something 
this stupid. I ought to know better. I’m such a jerk. I disgust myself. I must 
never, ever make this kind of mistake again.”
By the time he finishes his self-abuse, Steve feels more anxious and even a 
little depressed. His mistake leads him to make all three types of condem-
nations: He judges his error as stupid, he says he shouldn’t have allowed 
it to happen, and he declares himself a jerk when it does. It’s no wonder 
that Steve feels anxious when he works on his checkbook. Ironically, the 
increased anxiety makes further mistakes more likely.
See the later section “Judging the judge” for ways to replace these words 
with more positive language.
Turning to victim words
You may remember the story The Little Engine That Could by Watty Piper, 
about the train that needed to climb a steep hill. The author of the book 
wisely chose not to have the engine say, “I think I can’t; I’ll never be able to 
do it; this hill is impossible.”

94
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
The world feels like a much scarier place when you habitually think of your-
self as a victim of circumstance. Certain words can serve as a flag for that 
kind of thinking, such as these victimizing words: can’t, defenseless, frail, 
helpless, impossible, impotent, incapacitated, overwhelmed, powerless, and 
vulnerable.
 
Victim words demoralize. They offer no hope. Without hope, there’s little 
reason for positive action. When victims believe themselves defenseless, they 
feel vulnerable and afraid.
However, people who describe themselves as victims do enjoy a few advan-
tages: They don’t feel compelled to do much about whatever predicaments 
they face; people express sympathy for them; and some people offer to 
take care of them. Yet these advantages become self-defeating in the long 
run. To help yourself overcome the victim mind-set, flip to the later section 
“Vanquishing victim words.”
Tracking Your Worry Words
 
You probably don’t realize how often you use worry words inside your head. 
Because worry words contribute to stress and anxiety, performing a checkup 
on your use of these words is a good idea. You can start by tuning in to your 
self-talk that works like a play-by-play sports announcer in your mind. Get a 
small notepad and carry it with you for a few days. Listen to what you say to 
yourself when you feel stressed or worried. Take a few minutes to write the 
internal chatter down.
Now, check your internal monologue for worry words. You may discover that 
you use a few worry words that we haven’t listed, and some words could fit 
into more than one category. That’s okay. Just look for the relevant themes. 
Underline them and then put them into these general categories:
 
✓ Extremist: Words that exaggerate or make something seem catastrophic
 
✓ All-or-none: Polar opposites with nothing in between
 
✓ Judging, commanding, and labeling: Stern evaluations and 
name-calling
 
✓ Victim: Words that underestimate your ability to cope
In the following example, Frank discovers how prevalent his use of worry 
words really is:

95
 Chapter 6: Watching Out for Worry Words
Frank, a talented mechanic, is promoted to shop supervisor. Frank’s 
punctuality, attention to detail, and perfectionism reflect his stellar work 
ethic. Unfortunately, Frank’s perfectionism goes too far. He obsesses over 
the quality of his employees’ work. He checks and rechecks everything. In 
order to feel like he’s doing his job properly, he starts working 60 hours 
or more each week. His blood pressure starts to rise, and his doctor tells 
him that he needs to reduce his stress and anxiety. So Frank picks up a 
copy of Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies and decides to try tracking and 
trapping his worry words. This is what he writes; then he underlines each 
worry word he detects:
The workload is dreadful. It’s impossible to keep up; I’m overwhelmed. 
But I should be able to do everything. I’m an absolute failure if I can’t 
get the work out. Because I’m the boss, I must be responsible for all the 
workers. If everyone doesn’t do his job, I’m totally responsible. If some-
one else makes a mistake, I should be on top of it. I can’t stand the idea of 
a dissatisfied customer. When someone complains, it feels like a calamity. 
I feel like a loser and a jerk if I can’t make things right.
Frank categorizes the worry words he discovers as follows:
 
✓ Extremist words: dreadful, calamity, can’t stand
 
✓ All-or-none words: totally, absolute
 
✓ Judging, commanding, and labeling words: loser, jerk, should, must, 
failure
 
✓ Victim words: overwhelmed, impossible
Frank is surprised to see how many worry words pepper his mind. He vows 
to try and replace his extreme words with more moderate words. The next 
sections show you how to revise your own internal language.
Refuting and Replacing 
Your Worry Words
Ask yourself how you truly want to feel. Few people like feeling anxious, wor-
ried, and stressed. Who would choose those feelings? So perhaps you agree 
that you prefer to feel calm and serene rather than wound up.
A good way to start feeling better is to change your worry words. However, 
you aren’t likely to stop using worry words just because we told you that 

96
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
they create anxiety. That’s because you still may think that these words accu-
rately describe you and/or your world. Many people go through life without 
questioning their self-talk, simply assuming words equate with reality.
 
In order to refute the accuracy of your internal chatter, consider a small 
change in philosophy. This shift in philosophy entails questioning the idea 
that thoughts, language, and words automatically capture truth. Then substi-
tute that idea with a new one: using logic and evidence-gathering to structure 
your reality (Chapter 5 has more on this). At the same time, keep in mind that 
your goal is to experience more calm.
In the following sections, we look at each category of worry words and show 
you how to replace them with words that more accurately represent the 
situation.
Exorcising your extremist words
The vast majority of the time when people use extremist words, such as 
intolerable, agonizing, horrible, awful, hopeless, and ghastly, they use them to 
describe everyday events. When you hear yourself using those words, sub-
ject them to a logical analysis.
For example, few events in life are unbearable. After all, you’ve managed to 
get through every single difficult time in your life up to now or you wouldn’t 
be alive and reading this book. Many circumstances feel really bad, but some-
how, you deal with them. Life goes on.
 
When you think in extreme terms, such as unbearable, intolerable, can’t stand 
it, awful, and disastrous, you lose hope. Your belief in your ability to manage 
and carry on diminishes. Consider whether your unpleasant experiences are 
actually described more accurately in a different way:
 
✓ Difficult but not unbearable
 
✓ Uncomfortable but not intolerable
 
✓ Disagreeable but not devastating
 
✓ Distressing but not agonizing
Remember your goal of feeling calmer. When you drop extreme language 
from your vocabulary, your emotions also drop. Moderate descriptors soften 
your reactions. Less-extreme portrayals lead you to believe in your ability to 
cope. Humans have a surprising reservoir of resilience. You cultivate your 
capacity for problem-solving and survival when you have hope.

97
 Chapter 6: Watching Out for Worry Words
Disputing all-or-none
People use all-or-none words, such as never, always, absolute, forever, unceas-
ing, and constant, because they’re quick and easy and they add emotional 
punch. But these terms have insidious downsides: They push your thinking 
to extremes, and your emotions join the ride. Furthermore, all-or-none words 
detract from coping and problem-solving.
 
Rarely does careful gathering of evidence support the use of all-or-none 
words. Many people use all-or-none words to predict the future or to describe 
the past. For example, “I’ll never get promoted,” or, “You always criticize 
me.” Whether you’re talking to yourself or someone else, these words hardly 
produce calmness, nor do they describe what has happened or what’s likely 
to happen in the future. So try to stay in the present. Table 6-1 illustrates the 
switch between all-or-none words and calm, evidence-gathering words that 
keep you in the present without distortion.
Table 6-1 
Switching to the Present
All or None
In the Present without Distortion 
I’ll never get promoted.
At this moment, I don’t know whether I’ll be 
promoted. However, I’ll do everything that I 
can to see to it that it happens. 
You always criticize me. 
Right now, your criticism makes me feel bad. 
I always panic when I’m in a 
crowd.
Right now, I can’t know for certain whether 
I’ll panic the next time I’m in a crowd. I may 
panic, and I may not. If I do, it’s not the worst 
thing in the world, and I won’t die from it.
Judging the judge
Words that judge, command, or label, such as should, must, failure, fool, unde-
serving, and freak, inflict unnecessary pain and shame on their recipients. 
You may hear these words from others or from your own critic within.
Labels and judgments describe a person as a whole, but people usually use 
them to describe a specific action. For example, if you make a mistake, you 
may say to yourself, “I can’t believe that I could be such an idiot!” If you do, 
you just made a global evaluation of your entire being based on a single 
action. Is that useful? Clearly, it’s not accurate, and most importantly, the 
judgment doesn’t lead you to feel calm or serene.

98
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
Like the other types of worry words, commandments don’t inspire motiva-
tion and improved performance. Yet people use these words for that very 
purpose. They think that saying “I must or should” will help them, but these 
words are more likely to make them feel guilty or anxious. Self-scolding 
merely increases guilt and anxiety, and guilt and anxiety inevitably decrease 
both motivation and performance.
 
Try replacing your judging, commanding, and labeling words with more 
reasonable, accurate, and supportable alternatives. Consider the following 
examples:
 
✓ Judging: I got a pathetic score on my ACT test. I must be stupid.
 
 Reasonable alternative: It wasn’t the score that I wanted, but I can 
study more and retake it.
 
✓ Commanding: I must have a happy marriage. I should have what it takes 
to keep it happy.
 
 Reasonable alternative: Much as I’d like to have a happy marriage, I 
was okay before I met my wife, and I can learn to be okay again if I have 
to. Being happily married is just my strong preference, and I don’t have 
complete control over the outcome — it does take two, after all.
Vanquishing victim words
Victim words, such as powerless, helpless, vulnerable, overwhelmed, and 
defenseless, put you in a deep hole and fill you with a sense of vulnerability 
and fear. They make you feel as though finding a way out is impossible and 
that hope remains out of reach. Yet as with other worry words, only rarely do 
they convey absolute truth.
Nevertheless, victim words can become what are known as self-fulfilling 
prophecies. If you think a goal is impossible, you’re not likely to achieve it. If 
you think that you’re powerless, you won’t draw on your coping resources. 
As an alternative, consider the logic of your victim words. Is there anything 
at all that you can do to remedy or at least improve your problem?
 
Gather evidence for refuting victim words that appear in your self-talk. Ask 
yourself whether you’ve ever managed to cope with a similar situation before. 
Think about a friend, an acquaintance, or anyone at all who has successfully 
dealt with a burden like yours.
After you consider the logic and the evidence, ask whether victim words 
make you feel better, calmer, or less anxious. If not, replace those words with 
new ones, as in the following examples:

99
 Chapter 6: Watching Out for Worry Words
 
✓ Victim: I have a fatal disease, and I’m totally powerless to do anything 
about it.
 
 Reasonable alternative: I have a disease that’s indeed often fatal. 
However, I can explore every avenue from new experimental treatments 
to alternative treatments. If that doesn’t work, I can still find meaning 
with the rest of my life.
 
✓ Victim: I feel overwhelmed by debt. I feel helpless and have no options 
other than declaring bankruptcy.
 
 Reasonable alternative: I do have a considerable debt. However, I could 
go to a credit-counseling agency that specializes in renegotiating inter-
est rates and payments. I may also be able to get a second, part-time job 
and chip away at the bills. If I ultimately do have to declare bankruptcy, I 
can slowly rebuild my credit.

Chapter 7
Busting Up Your Agitating 
Assumptions
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how some beliefs make you anxious
▶ Discovering your agitating assumptions
▶ Challenging your anxious beliefs
▶ Replacing your worry convictions
S
ome people love to speak in front of crowds; others shake at the very 
thought of public speaking. Ever notice how people respond to criti-
cism? Some blow it off, some get angry, and others are extremely embar-
rassed. While one person may become anxious about traffic, airplanes, or 
health, another becomes anxious about finances, and still another feels anx-
ious only around bugs. A few people rarely become anxious at all.
This chapter explains why different people respond to the same event in 
extremely different ways. We show you how certain beliefs or assumptions 
about yourself and the world cause you to feel the way you do about what 
happens. These beliefs are also called schemas. One way to think about 
these schemas or beliefs is to think of them as lenses or glasses that you 
look through. As you know, sometimes lenses can be cloudy, dirty, smoky, 
cracked, distorted, rose-colored, or clear. Some schema lenses make people 
scared or anxious when they see their world through them. We call those 
anxious schemas or agitating assumptions.
We show you how certain anxious schemas generate excessive worry and 
anxiety. These beliefs come primarily from your life experiences — they don’t 
mean you’re defective. Of course, as discussed in Chapter 3 and elsewhere, 
all aspects of anxiety are also influenced by biological factors. The question-
naire in this chapter helps you discover which assumptions may agitate and 
create anxiety in you. We provide ways for you to challenge those anxious 
schemas. Replacing your agitating assumptions with calming schemas can 
reduce your anxiety.

102
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
 
We consider the terms anxious schemas and agitating assumptions equivalent, 
but we get bored easily, so we like to mix them up.
Understanding Agitating Assumptions
A schema is something that you presume to be correct without question. You 
don’t think about such assumptions or schemas; rather, you take them for 
granted as basic truths. For example, you probably believe that fall follows 
summer and that someone who smiles at you is friendly and someone who 
scowls at you isn’t. You assume without thinking that a red light means stop 
and a green light means go. Your assumptions provide a map for getting you 
through life quickly and efficiently.
And that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Your schemas guide you through your 
days with less effort. For example, most people assume their paychecks will 
arrive more or less on time. That assumption allows them to plan ahead, pay 
bills, and avoid unnecessary worry. If people didn’t make this assumption, 
they’d constantly check with their payroll department or boss to ensure timely 
delivery of their checks to the annoyance of all concerned. Unfortunately, the 
schema of expecting a paycheck is shattered when jobs are scarce or layoffs 
increase. Understandably, people with expectations of regular paychecks feel 
pretty anxious when their assumptions don’t hold true.
Similarly, most people have assumptions (or schemas) about food. They 
assume that the food sold in the grocery store is safe to eat — in spite of 
occasional news reports about tainted food showing up in stores. On the 
other hand, food sold on a street corner in a third-world country might be 
assumed to be less safe to eat. Many tourists would avoid such food even if 
was actually fine. So, while people act on their schemas and assumptions, 
they’re not always correct in doing so.
As you can see, sometimes schemas fail to provide useful information. They 
may even distort reality so much that they arouse considerable distress. For 
example, before giving a speech, you may tremble, quiver, and sweat. You 
may worry that you’ll stumble over your words, drop your notes, or even 
worse, faint from fear. Even though these things have seldom happened when 
you’ve previously given speeches, you always assume that they will this time. 
That dread of embarrassment comes from an anxious schema.
 
Anxious schemas assume the worst about yourself or the world — and usually 
they’re incorrect.
When activated, agitating assumptions cause anxiety and worry. Unfortunately, 
most people don’t even know they have these schemas. Therefore, agitating 
assumptions can go unchallenged for many years, leaving them free to fuel 
anxiety.

103
 Chapter 7: Busting Up Your Agitating Assumptions
Sizing Up Anxious Schemas
Perhaps you’re curious as to whether you hold any anxious schemas. People 
usually don’t even know if they have these troubling beliefs, so they don’t ques-
tion them. Challenging agitating assumptions has to start with knowing which 
ones you have. In the following sections, we identify five anxious schemas and 
then provide a quiz to help you determine whether you suffer from any of them.
Recognizing schemas
In our work with clients, we’ve found that five major anxious schemas plague 
them:
 
✓ Perfectionism: Perfectionists assume that they must do everything right 
or they will have failed totally, and the consequences will be devastat-
ing. They ruminate over minor details.
 
✓ Approval: Approval addicts assume they must win the approval of 
others at any cost to themselves. They can’t stand criticism.
 
✓ Vulnerability: Those afflicted with the vulnerability assumption feel 
at the mercy of life’s forces. They worry all the time about possible 
disasters.
 
✓ Control: Those with the control assumption feel that they can’t trust 
or rely on anyone but themselves. They always want to be the driver — 
never the passenger.
 
✓ Dependency: Those with the dependency assumption feel they can’t 
survive on their own and turn to others for help.
These anxious schemas have a powerful influence on the way you respond 
to circumstances. For example, imagine that the majority of comments you 
get on a performance review at work are quite positive, but one sentence 
describes a minor problem. Each schema causes a different reaction:
 
✓ If you have the perfectionism schema, you severely scold yourself for 
your failure. You won’t even see the positive comments.
 
✓ If you have the approval schema, you obsess about whether your boss 
still likes you.
 
✓ If you have the vulnerability schema, you believe that you’re about to 
lose your job, and then your house and car.
 
✓ If you have a control schema, you focus on how working for someone 
else makes you feel out of control and helpless.
 
✓ If you have the dependency schema, you look to others for support and 
help. You ask your coworkers to intervene on your behalf with the boss.

104
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
Various individuals react completely differently to the same event, depend-
ing on which assumption those individuals hold. Just imagine the reaction of 
someone who simultaneously holds several of these schemas. One sentence 
in a performance review could set off a huge emotional storm of anxiety and 
distress.
You may have one or more of these anxiety-creating schemas or assumptions 
to one degree or another. Taking the quiz in the following section helps you 
find out which, if any, anxious schemas you hold.
Assessing your agitating assumptions
In Table 7-1, place a check mark in the column marked “T” if a statement is 
true or mostly true as a description of you; conversely, place a check mark in 
the column marked “F” if a statement is false or mostly false as it pertains to

think you should be; instead, answer on the basis of how you really do act 
and respond to events in your life.

I ask advice about most things that I do.
I need a great deal of reassurance.
I rarely do things without other people.
Most people endorse one or more of these items as true. So don’t worry too 
much if you find quite a few statements that apply to you. For example, who 
doesn’t hate being embarrassed? And most people worry at least a little 
about the future.
So how do you know whether you have a problem with one of these assump-
tions? You start by looking at each assumption one at a time. If you checked 
one or more items as true, that raises the possibility that this assumption 
causes you some trouble. Just how much trouble depends on how much dis-
tress you feel.
Ask yourself what makes you feel especially anxious. Does it have to do with 
one or more items that you checked as true? If so, you probably struggle with 
that anxious schema. We cover each schema and ways to overcome it later in 
this chapter.
 
If you have a number of these agitating assumptions, don’t get down on your-
self! You likely developed your anxious schemas for good reasons. You should 
congratulate yourself for starting to figure out the problem. That’s the first 
step toward feeling better.
Coming Down with a Case 
of Anxious Schemas
If you have too much anxiety, one or more agitating assumptions undoubt-
edly cause you problems. But it’s especially important to know that you’re 

106
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
not crazy for having agitating assumptions! People acquire these schemas in 
two completely understandable ways:
 
✓ When experiences in childhood prevent the development of a reason-
able sense of safety, security, acceptance, or approval
 
✓ When shocking, traumatic events shatter previously held assumptions
The following sections explain in more detail how these experiences lead to 
anxious schemas.
Acquiring assumptions in childhood
You may have been one of the lucky ones who glided through childhood feel-
ing loved, accepted, safe, and secure. Perhaps you lived in a home with two 
loving parents, a dog, a station wagon, and a white picket fence. Or maybe 
not. You probably didn’t have a perfect childhood. Not many people do. For 
the most part, your parents probably did the best they could, but they were 
human. Perhaps they had bad tempers or ran into financial difficulties. Or 
possibly, they had addictions or failed to look out for your safety as well 
as they should have. For these and numerous other reasons, you may have 
acquired one or more agitating assumptions.
The following example illustrates the most common time in life for anxious 
schemas to develop: childhood.
Harold developed his agitating assumption as a child. Harold’s mother 
rarely gave him much approval. She harshly criticized almost every-
thing he did. For example, his room was never quite clean enough, and 
his grades were never quite stellar enough. Even when he brought his 
mother a gift, she told him it was the wrong color or size. He felt he could 
do almost nothing right.
Slowly but surely, Harold acquired an agitating assumption — “I must be 
absolutely perfect, or I will be a total failure.” Being perfect is pretty hard. 
So you can imagine why he now feels anxious most of the time.
Notice that Harold’s anxious schema about perfection didn’t come about 
from a massive, single event. Rather, a series of criticisms and corrections 
built his schema of perfection up over time. Unfortunately, his schema con-
tinues to plague him as an adult.
 
If you have agitating assumptions, you don’t question them. You believe in 
them wholeheartedly. Just as Harold assumes the sky is blue, he believes that 
he’s either perfect or a complete failure. When Harold undertakes a project, he 
feels intense anxiety due to his morbid fear of making a mistake. Harold’s agi-
tating assumption is that of painful perfectionism, and it makes him miserable, 
but he doesn’t know why.

107
 Chapter 7: Busting Up Your Agitating Assumptions
Shattering your reasonable assumptions
Anxious schemas most often begin during childhood (see the preceding sec-
tion), but not always. Sometimes, what seems to be a common, though unfor-
tunate, occurrence can lead to an anxious schema. The following example 
illustrates how present-day life can create an agitating assumption.
Bill had always assumed, like most people do, that working hard and 
saving his money would assure him a safe, secure financial future and 
retirement. He has worked at his family’s auto parts and service store for 
25 years. He follows his financial advisor’s advice and, at the age of 50, 
has half of his money in the stock market. The economy takes a horrible 
hit and his shop lays off most of its employees. Bill reluctantly puts a 
substantial part of his savings into buoying the business. Then the stock 
market tanks and Bill sees that his hard-won gains have virtually evapo-
rated. Eventually, the store closes its doors and Bill looks for work.
At the age of 50, he sees that he’s not likely to find something that pays 
what he used to get from the family business. Instead of looking at ways 
to develop new skills or options, he sits hopelessly watching the stock 
market on television for many hours every day.
Bill, formerly confident and self-assured, feels insecure, worried, and 
obsessed about his financial status. He has formed a new assumption — 
a vulnerability schema focused on money. He worries constantly about 
how he’ll get by financially.
Bill had a very good reason to form that assumption, and like most agitating 
assumptions, Bill’s schema contains some truth — you can never know with 
certainty what the future will bring. However, as with all agitating assump-
tions, the problem lies in the fact that Bill underestimates his ability to adapt 
and cope. Therefore, he now spends his days engaged in unproductive 
obsessing rather than changing his goals and lifestyle while developing new 
skills or possibilities.
Cars: A dangerous mode of transportation?
Although many people overestimate the risks 
of driving, you should know that driving does 
involve significant dangers. The National Safety 
Council has compared travel on buses, planes, 
trains, and cars. Deaths from automobile acci-
dents far exceed deaths from all of these other 
modes of transportation combined. Sounds 
scary, doesn’t it? However, the odds of dying 
in your car don’t look all that bad. For every 
100 million miles driven, there is less than one 
fatality.

108
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
 
Perhaps you consider yourself immune from inordinate amounts of anxiety, 
but don’t be so quick to jump to that conclusion. In fact, many people who 
read our books are therapists or counselors who have skills and tools that 
keep them on an even keel most of the time. Nonetheless, anxious schemas 
can pop up for anyone at any time. The following true story about Dr. Laura 
Smith (coauthor of this book) is a case in point.
One evening Dr. Smith sat in the hair salon. Suddenly, a thug stormed 
in, demanding that everyone lie on the floor, face down, and hand over 
their money and jewelry. He brandished a .44 magnum pistol to empha-
size his point. Not long after the incident, Dr. Smith realized that she had 
acquired the agitating assumption of vulnerability. She found herself 
worrying about safety much more than she had in the past. She began 
to nervously scan parking lots and jump at loud noises. When she found 
herself waking up from nightmares, she knew the vulnerability assump-
tion was creating trouble and that she needed to do something about it. 
So she used some of the techniques described in this book, especially 
Chapter 8. These strategies included gradually returning to the scene of 
the crime, talking about the crime, and relaxation. Soon, her vulnerability 
schema began to fade. By the way, it’s now almost ten years later and she 
still goes to the same hair salon.
 
Anxious schemas may begin when you’re quite young — perhaps only 4 or 
5 years old — or they may emerge much later in life. Either way, they cause 
problems.
Challenging Those Nasty Assumptions: 
Running a Cost/Benefit Analysis
After taking our quiz and finding out about anxious schemas in the previous 
sections, you now have a better idea about which ones may be giving you 
trouble. In the old days, many therapists would have told you that insight is 
enough. We disagree. Pretend you just took an eye test and found out that you 
suffer from severe nearsightedness. Wow, you have insight! But what does that 
change? Not much. You still walk around bumping into the furniture.
You’re about to get a prescription for seeing through your problematic 
assumptions. It starts with a cost/benefit analysis. This analysis paves the 
way for making changes.
Perhaps you think your perfectionism assumption is good and appropriate. 
Maybe you believe that you have profited from your perfectionism and that 

109
 Chapter 7: Busting Up Your Agitating Assumptions
it has helped you accomplish more in your life. If so, why in the world would 
you want to challenge or change it? The answer is simple. You wouldn’t.
Therefore, you need to take a cold, hard look at the costs as well as any pos-
sible benefits of perfectionism. Only if the costs outweigh the benefits does 
it make sense to do something about your perfectionism. After looking at the 
examples in the next five sections, see the “Challenging your own anxious 
schemas” section for directions on how to conduct a cost/benefit analysis for 
your personal problematic anxious schemas.
Analyzing perfection
Knowing which problematic anxious schemas lurk in your mind is the first 
step toward change. However, just knowing isn’t going to get you there. You 
need to feel motivated to make changes. Change takes effort, and frankly, it’s 
downright hard to change. The story about Prudence shows you someone 
who has the perfection schema and how she finds the motivation to change 
her assumption through a cost/benefit analysis.
Prudence, a successful trial attorney, works about 70 hours per week. 
Her closet is full of power suits; she wears her perfectionism like a badge 
of honor. Prudence works out to maintain her trim figure and manages to 
attend all the right social events. At 43 years of age, Prudence stands on 
top of her profession. Too busy for a family of her own, she dotes on her 
9-year-old niece and gives her lavish presents on holidays.
Prudence is shocked when her doctor tells her that her blood pressure 
has gone out of control. Her doctor wonders about the stress in her life. 
She says it’s nothing that she can’t handle. He inquires about her sleep 
habits, and she replies, “What sleep?”
Prudence is in trouble, and she doesn’t even know it. She believes that 
her high income is due to her relentless standards and that she can’t let 
up in the slightest way.
Prudence has little hope of changing her anxious schema of perfection if 
she doesn’t face it head on. Her doctor suggests that she see a counselor, 
who tells her to run a cost/benefit analysis of her perfection assumption.
A cost/benefit analysis starts with listing every imaginable benefit of an agi-
tating assumption. Including every benefit your imagination can possibly con-
jure up is important. Then, and only then, should you start thinking about the 
costs of the assumption. Take a look at Table 7-2 to see what Prudence sees 
as perfectionism’s benefits.

Prudence’s fondness for her perfectionism is no small wonder. Filling out the 
benefits in her cost/benefit analysis is easy for her, but what about the costs? 
Prudence will probably have to expend much more effort to complete the 
costs, and she may even have to ask other people for ideas. Now, review in 
Table 7-3 what she writes after she works at the task and consults others.

Actually, I think my focus on work

ingful relationship.
My schema causes me to procras-

perfectly. That’s caused me to miss 
deadlines sometimes. 
 
The cost/benefit analysis helps you to know whether you really want to chal-
lenge your agitating assumptions. You would probably agree that Prudence’s 
example shows more costs than benefits. But wait, it isn’t finished. The final 
step is to examine carefully whether you would lose all the benefits by chang-
ing the assumption.
For example, Prudence attributes her high income to her dedication and long 
work hours. Perhaps she’s partly right, but would her income evaporate if 
she worked just a little less? Most likely, if she worked less, her income might 
drop a bit, but with less anxiety, she might increase her efficiency enough 
to make up the difference. If she were less irritable, she would be able to 
retain her secretarial staff and gain efficiency there too. And would Prudence 
actually start making more mistakes if she relaxed her standards? Research 
suggests that excessive anxiety decreases performance. With respect to her 
niece, Prudence isn’t really getting the benefit that she thinks she is, because 
she’s not around enough to serve as an effective role model. Finally, more 
people fear Prudence than admire her. So you see, many times the perceived 
benefits of an assumption evaporate upon close inspection.
Anxiety: How much is too much?
A little bit of anxiety seems to improve perfor-
mance and reduce mistakes. Some anxiety 
channels attention and effort to the task at hand. 
Without anxiety, people don’t take tasks seri-
ously or prepare sufficiently. However, when 
perfectionism reaches extreme levels, so does 
anxiety, and performance drops off. Excessive 
anxiety interferes with the ability to recall previ-
ously learned information, and mistakes multi-
ply. That’s why people with perfection schemas 
often have severe test anxiety. They know the 
material, but their anxiety causes them to forget 
what they have previously learned. Their fear of 
imperfection causes what they fear.

112
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
Tabulating approval
Approval addicts constantly crave admiration and acceptance from others. 
They worry about rejection and criticism. They constantly scan people’s 
faces for any sign of disapproval. People with this anxious schema often mis-
interpret the intentions of others. However, they’re reluctant to give up their 
anxious approval schema. That’s because they fear that letting go of their 
worry habit will result in abandonment or rejection.
Anne, a graduate student in social work, has to meet each week with her 
advisor for supervision of her casework. She dreads those supervision 
sessions, always fearing her advisor’s criticism. Anne does plenty for her 
clients; she does anything that she thinks they may need help with — 
spending hours of her own time, even running errands for them if they 
ask. Her supervisor tries to tell her to pull back from giving excessive 
help to her clients; he says that her bending over backwards to assist 
clients doesn’t help her or her clients. She cries after hearing her supervi-
sor’s comments.
However, Anne’s worst fears surround the required presentations in front 
of graduate school classmates. Before giving talks to her classmates, she 
spends an abundance of time in the bathroom feeling ill. During lively dis-
cussions in her class, Anne remains quiet and almost never takes sides. 
Anne is addicted to approval.
Anne walks quietly through life. People rarely criticize her. She avoids 
embarrassment by not taking risks. She is kind-hearted and people like 
her. What’s wrong with that?
Well, a cost/benefit analysis of Anne’s approval schema reveals that people 
walk all over her. It also shows that fellow students fail to appreciate how 
bright she is, because she rarely speaks up in class. Anne neglects her own 
needs and at times feels resentful when she does so much for others and they 
do so little to return the favor. Anne’s approval addiction doesn’t give her 
what she expects. Sure, she rarely receives criticism, but because she takes 
so few risks, she never gets the approval and praise that she really wants.
Reviewing vulnerability
The anxious schema of vulnerability plagues people with worries about their 
safety, livelihood, and security. They traverse through their worlds in a state 
of constant, high alert. People with this schema often receive a diagnosis of 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (see Chapter 2). The following example illus-
trates someone with the vulnerability schema.
Peter, a college graduate with a business degree, receives a promotion 
that requires him to move to California, but he turns it down because 

113
 Chapter 7: Busting Up Your Agitating Assumptions
he fears big cities and earthquakes. Peter watches the weather chan-
nel and listens to the news before he ventures any distance from home 
and avoids driving if the radio reports any chance of inclement weather. 
Peter’s worry restricts his life. He also worries about his health and often 
visits his doctor, complaining of vague symptoms, such as nausea, head-
aches, and fatigue. Peter’s doctor suggests that his worry may be causing 
many of his physical problems. He tells Peter to fill out a cost/benefit 
analysis of his vulnerability schema, which you can see in Table 7-4.
Table 7-4 Cost/Benefit Analysis of Peter’s Vulnerability Schema
Benefits
Costs
I keep myself safe.
I worry all the time.
I work hard to stay healthy.
Sometimes I can’t stop thinking 
about my health.
I stay away from harm.
I’m so concerned about getting 
hurt that I’ve never enjoyed things 
that other people do, such as 
skiing or taking trips abroad.
I am more careful than most people about 
saving for retirement. 
I worry so much about tomorrow 
that I forget to enjoy today.
I don’t take unnecessary risks.
My doctor tells me that my worry 
probably harms my health more 
than anything else.
I worry so much that I make mis-
takes.
My worry ruins my ability to 
appreciate what’s important in 
life. 
Someone as entrenched as Peter in his vulnerability schema certainly isn’t 
going to give it up just because of his cost/benefit analysis. However, this 
analysis starts the ball rolling by showing him that his assumption is costing 
him big-time. The exercise motivates him to start thinking about doing some 
things differently.
Counting up control
People who have an anxious control schema only feel comfortable when 
they hold the reins. They fear that others won’t do what’s necessary to keep 
the world steady and safe. Giving up control makes them feel helpless. At 

114
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
the same time, many of those with this assumption fear losing control and 
embarrassing themselves if that were to happen.
Jeff, the head of a division at his engineering company, likes order in his 
life. His employees know him as a taskmaster who micro-manages. Jeff 
takes pride in the fact that, although he asks for plenty, he demands more 
of himself than he does of his employees. He issues orders and expects 
immediate results. His division leads the company in productivity.
You may think that Jeff has it made. It certainly sounds like his issue with 
control pays off handsomely. But scratch beneath the surface, and you 
see a different picture. Although known for productivity, his division is 
viewed as lacking in creativity and leads all others in requests for trans-
fers. The real cost of Jeff’s control assumption comes crashing down 
upon him when, at 46 years of age, he suffers his first heart attack.
Jeff has spent many years feeling stressed and anxious, but he never looks 
closely at the issue. Jeff’s quest for control nets him the opposite of what he 
wanted. Ultimately, he loses control of his life and health.
If control is one of your agitating assumptions, do a cost/benefit analysis. 
Jeff’s fate doesn’t have to be yours, too.
Debating dependency
People with a dependency schema turn to others whenever the going gets 
tough. Or for that matter, whenever the going is pretty easy. They don’t 
see themselves as capable. They believe they need others to help them get 
through almost any difficulty. Unfortunately, people with the anxious depen-
dency schema often lose the people they depend on the most. Why? They 
burn them out. The next story about Daniel is typical.
Daniel lived with his parents until, at 31 years of age, he married 
Dorothy. He met Dorothy online and, after just a few dates, decided to 
marry her. Dorothy seemed independent and secure, qualities that Daniel 
craved but lacked. At the beginning of their relationship, Dorothy was 
fond of Daniel’s constant attention. Today, he still calls her at work three 
or four times every day, asking for advice about trivia and sometimes 
seeking reassurance that she still loves him. If she’s five minutes late, he’s 
beside himself. He often worries that she’ll leave him. Dorothy’s friends 
tell her that they aren’t sure that Daniel could go to the bathroom by him-
self. Daniel believes that he can’t survive without her. After he quits sev-
eral jobs because “they’re too hard,” Dorothy threatens divorce. Daniel 
finally sees a therapist who has him conduct a cost/benefit analysis of his 
dependency schema, as shown in Table 7-5.

Life isn’t as scary when I

My wife gets angry when I don’t take initiative.
I’m never lonely because 
I always make sure that I

I might drive my wife away if I continue to cling to

someone else takes care of

Sometimes I’d like to take care of something, but I 
think I’ll screw it up.
I haven’t discovered how to master very much. 
Sometimes I feel like a Mama’s boy.
Someone like Daniel is unlikely to give up his defective dependency assump-
tion without more work than this. However, a cost/benefit analysis can pro-
vide an initial push. Meaningful change takes time and work.
Challenging your own anxious schemas
You can run your own cost/benefit analysis. See the list of agitating assump-
tions in the “Sizing Up Anxious Schemas” section, earlier in this chapter. 
Which ones trouble you? If you haven’t already taken the Anxious Schemas 
Quiz in Table 7-1, do so now and look at your answers. Do you tend towards 
perfection, seeking approval, vulnerability, control, or dependency or maybe 
have a combination of these schemas?
First, determine which schema applies to you; if the quiz shows that you 
suffer from more than one schema, select one. Then, using the format of 
Table 7-5, fill out all the benefits that you can think of for your anxious 
schema in the left-hand column. Next, fill in the costs in the right-hand 
column. Refer to the cost/benefit analyses that Prudence, Peter, and Daniel 
(see Tables 7-3, 7-4, and 7-5, respectively) filled out earlier in the chapter.

116
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
 
If you get stuck filling out the costs column, ask a trusted friend or partner for 
help. Seeking input doesn’t necessarily mean that you operate on the depen-
dency assumption or that you’re overly dependent; sometimes you just need 
someone else’s perspective to see what your anxiety is costing you.
When you’ve finished your cost/benefit analysis, take another look at each 
of the benefits. Ask yourself whether those benefits will truly disappear if 
you change your agitating assumption. Prudence the perfectionist believes 
that her income is higher because of her perfectionism, but is that really 
true? Many people report that they make far more mistakes when they feel 
under pressure. Perfectionism, if nothing else, certainly causes pressure. 
So, it’s probably not the case that perfectionists earn more money and make 
fewer mistakes. As often as not, they end up not doing as well as they could 
because their perfectionism leads them into making more mistakes.
When you look carefully at your perceived benefits, you’re likely to find, like 
Prudence, that the presumed benefits won’t evaporate if you change your 
assumption.
Similarly, Anne thinks she avoids embarrassment by never speaking in class. 
But she finds herself even more frightened and embarrassed when she’s 
required to present in class than if she took more risks earlier. Avoiding what 
she fears seems to increase her worries. So Anne receives a double dose of 
what she so desperately wants to avoid.
 
Agitating assumptions often get you the opposite of what you want. They 
cause worry and stress, and rarely give you any true benefits. If you’re going 
to give up your assumptions, you need to replace them with a more balanced 
perspective.
Designing Calm, Balanced Assumptions
So, do you think you have to be perfect or that everyone has to like you all 
the time? Do you always need to be in charge? Do you feel that you can’t 
manage life on your own? Or do you sometimes feel that the world is a dan-
gerous place? These are the agitating assumptions that stir up worry, stress, 
and anxiety.
Another problem with these schemas is that they do contain a kernel of 
truth. For example, it is nice when people like you, and it is nice to be in 
charge sometimes. We all need to depend on others sometimes as well. That 
sliver of truth makes people reluctant to abandon their assumptions.

117
 Chapter 7: Busting Up Your Agitating Assumptions
The solution is to find new, balanced schemas that hold even greater truth, 
but old assumptions are like habits — they’re hard to break. To do so requires 
finding a new habit to replace the old one. It also takes plenty of practice and 
self-control, but it isn’t that difficult. You just need a little persistence.
In the following sections, we go over each of the assumptions and help you 
see how to develop an alternative, more reasonable assumption to replace 
your old one. Try using these reasonable, balanced perspectives to talk back 
to your agitating assumptions when they occur. Finally, once you develop a 
new assumption, try acting in ways that are consistent with that new belief.
 
If you find that your agitating assumptions rule your life and cause you intense 
anxiety and misery, you may want to consult a professional psychologist or 
mental-health counselor. But first, start with your primary care doctor to rule 
out physical causes. Sometimes anxiety does have a physical base, and your 
primary care doctor can give you a referral after physical causes have been 
looked into. Should you consult a professional, you’ll still find this book useful 
because most anxiety experts are familiar with the tools that we provide, and 
they’ll help you implement them.
Tempering perfectionist tendencies
Perfectionists believe they have to be the best in everything they do. They feel 
horrible when they make mistakes, and if they’re not outstanding at something, 
they generally refrain from trying. Fortunately, a good cost/benefit analysis can 
often help them see that perfectionism exacts a terrible toll.
But if not perfect, then what? Some people think it would mean going to the 
other extreme. Thus, if they weren’t perfect, these folks assume that they 
would become sloths with no standards at all.
 
If you’re worried about giving up on your perfectionism schema, we have 
good news for you. The alternative is not the other extreme! You may find it 
helpful to copy the following statements, or what we call “balanced views” 
on an index card. Or, you may want to think of your own alternatives. Just be 
sure they aim for the middle ground. Carry your card around with you as a 
reminder for those times when you start to get hung up on perfectionism.
 
✓ I like to do well at things, but it’s silly to think that I have to be the best 
at everything.
 
✓ I’ll never be good at everything, and sometimes it’s really fun just to try 
something new.
 
✓ Everyone makes mistakes; I need to deal with it when I do.

118
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
In other words, if you currently hold the assumption that you must be per-
fect and do everything right or you’ll fail totally, try to think in less extreme 
terms. A more balanced schema is that you like doing things well, but that all 
humans make mistakes and so do you. You don’t want to be above the rest of 
us humans.
 
Collect evidence that refutes your perfectionist assumption. For example, 
think about all the people you admire, yet who make numerous mistakes 
over time. When they make mistakes, do you suddenly see them as defective? 
Doubtful. Use the same standard for yourself.
Balancing an approval addict
Approval addicts desperately want to be liked all the time. They sacrifice 
their own needs in order to please others. Standing up for themselves is 
hard because to do so would risk offending someone. When criticized, even 
unfairly, they tend to fall apart.
But isn’t it good to want people’s approval? As with all anxious schemas, it’s 
a matter of degree. Taken too far, the approval assumption can ruin your life.
But if you quit worrying about getting people’s approval, what will happen 
then? Will you end up isolated, rejected, and alone? Is rudeness and arrogant 
behavior the alternative to being nice all the time?
 
If you worry about giving up your approval addiction, we have an alternative. 
You just may want to carry these ideas in your pocket. Feel free to make up 
some on your own as well.
The deadly secrets of perfectionism
Perfectionism pays off . . . sometimes. A little bit 
of perfectionism probably can improve the qual-
ity of your work, sports, and other endeavors 
as long as you don’t let it get out of hand. How 
bad is it when perfectionism gets too extreme? 
Worse than you may think. Perfectionists often 
become extreme procrastinators just to avoid 
making mistakes. Not only that, perfectionists 
more often develop various types of anxiety 
disorders, depression, physical ailments, and 
eating disorders. Worst of all, it appears that 
adolescents who suffer from perfectionism 
have a higher rate of suicide.

 Chapter 7: Busting Up Your Agitating Assumptions
 
✓ What other people think matters, but it’s not usually crucial.
 
✓ Some people won’t like me no matter what I do. That’s true for everyone.
 
✓ I need to start paying attention to my needs at least as much as other 
people’s.
 
In addition, consider collecting evidence that refutes your anxious approval 
schema. For example, think about people whom you like and admire who 
manage to speak their minds and look out for their own needs. Why do you 
like them? It’s probably not because they bow and scrape to your every whim. 
Besides, someone who did that would probably turn you off.
If you feel addicted to approval and assume you must have the approval of 
others at all times and at virtually any cost, consider a more balanced per-
spective. Sure, everyone likes to be liked, but realize that no matter what 
you do, some people won’t like you some of the time. Try thinking that your 
needs matter and that what other people think of you does not define your 
worth.
Balancing vulnerability
People who hold the vulnerability schema feel unsafe and worry constantly 
about every conceivable mishap. They might worry about safety, health, 
natural disasters, or the future; they often feel like victims of life’s circum-
stances. They feel helpless to do much about their lot. The modern world 
with constant news about pandemics, natural catastrophes, financial ruin, 
and terror probably increases everyone’s sense of vulnerability. It’s no 
wonder that anxiety rates have skyrocketed (see Chapter 1).
People with this assumption fail to understand that worry has never stopped 
a single catastrophe. Nor does excessive worry help you prepare for the 
inevitable bad luck and misfortune that occur in everyone’s life.
 
A better, alternative assumption can keep you reasonably safe without all 
that worry. If you want to give up your vulnerable assumption, try carrying 
these ideas with you and use them like mantras, repeating them to yourself 
frequently:
 
✓ I need to take reasonable precautions but stop obsessing over safety. 
The amount of preparedness that I or anyone else can take action on is 
limited.
 
✓ I will go to the doctor for an annual physical, pay attention to nutrition 
and exercise, and follow my doctor’s advice. Beyond that, worrying 
about my health is pointless.
 
✓ Some unfortunate mishaps are unforeseen and out of my control. I need 
to accept that bad things happen; worry is no shield.

120
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
 
Again, if you hold the vulnerability assumption and feel that you’re at the 
mercy of life’s dangerous forces, you may want to consider a more balanced 
point of view. Try thinking that no one can prevent the trials and tribulations 
of life, but that you can usually cope when they do occur. Collect evidence 
about the many unpleasant incidents that you were able to cope with in the 
past. For example, when you had high blood pressure, perhaps you exercised 
or took medication to control it, or when you lost someone whom you cared 
for, you grieved, but you survived.
Relaxing control
Some people always want to take charge. They can’t stand taking orders. 
When in a group, they dominate the conversation. They always want to know 
everything that’s going on around them in their families and at work. They 
don’t delegate well. Some fear flying because they aren’t in the cockpit.
Being a control freak is tiring and causes plenty of anxiety, too. Perhaps you 
have trouble with this anxious schema. Many highly successful, intelligent 
folks do, and this assumption isn’t easy to give up. But the costs to health, 
well-being, and relationships are staggering.
 
As for all agitating assumptions, we have an alternative, balanced view that 
will serve you better than control ever did. Review our suggestions. And if you 
must take control and rewrite them, that’s okay, too!
 
✓ I can usually trust other people to do what they need to do. I don’t have 
to manage everyone, and they’re likely to resent me if I do.
 
✓ Asking for help or delegating a task isn’t the end of the world, and some-
times, delegating is much more efficient.
 
✓ I don’t have to know every single detail of what’s going on in order to 
feel in charge. Letting go reduces stress.
 
✓ Letting others lead can make them feel better and take a load off me.
 
Think of a time in your life when someone else was in charge and things 
turned out pretty well anyway. In other words, collect evidence about when 
not having control has worked out.
Diminishing dependency
People with the anxious dependency schema believe they can’t make it on 
their own. They ask for advice when they don’t really need it and seek reas-
surance that they’re loved or that what they’ve done is right. The thought of 

121
 Chapter 7: Busting Up Your Agitating Assumptions
not having a close relationship terrifies them. They can barely imagine trying 
to live life alone. You’re not likely to find someone with an agitating depen-
dency assumption eating alone at a restaurant.
Many anxious schemas ironically backfire. Excessively dependent people 
eventually annoy and irritate those whom they depend on. Partners of 
dependent people often distance themselves from the relationship after they 
become weary of constant clinging and helplessness.
 
If you battle with dependency, consider some of our alternative thoughts. 
Write these on an index card and keep them handy for frequent review. Feel 
free to embellish them or come up with some of your own.
 
✓ It’s nice to have someone who loves me, but I can survive on my own 
and have done so in the past.
 
✓ Seeking advice can be useful; working through an issue on my own is 
satisfying.
 
✓ I prefer to be with other people, but I can find out how to appreciate 
time alone.
If you buy into the defective dependency assumption — that you can’t be all 
right on your own and that you need help with all that you do — try think-
ing in a more reasonable fashion. Realize that it’s nice to have someone to 
depend on, but that you’re capable of many independent actions.
 
Collect evidence of your capabilities. Do you put gas in your own car? Do you 
manage your own checkbook? Do you get to work and back on your own? Can 
you remember the times that you did well without someone? Realizing that 
you have taken independent action successfully and remembering that you 
have pulled yourself through many difficult spots all on your own can boost 
your confidence enough to help you take more independent action in the 
future.
Above All: Be Kind to Yourself!
In our work with clients, we found that these anxious schemas are surpris-
ingly common, and many successful people who don’t even have a full-blown 
anxiety disorder tend to fall under the influence of one or more of these 
assumptions. Therefore, it’s important that you don’t beat up on yourself for 
“being under the influence.”
The origins of your anxious schemas could be in your childhood or the result 
of a traumatic event. Possibly your parents peppered you with criticism and 

122
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
that caused you to crave approval. Perhaps you had an unfortunate accident 
or trauma that caused you to feel vulnerable. Maybe your parents failed to 
provide you with consistent care and love, leading you to feel insecure, and, 
as a result, you yearn for help and affection. These represent merely a few 
of an infinite number of explanations for why you develop agitating assump-
tions. The point is that you didn’t ask for your problematic schemas; you 
came by them honestly.
You’ve started on the road to overcoming anxiety. Go slowly; take pleasure in 
the journey, and realize that change takes time and practice. Be patient with 
yourself.

Facing Fear One Step at a Time
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering how exposure works
▶ Facing fear through your imagination
▶ Confronting your fears head-on
▶ Applying exposure to your specific anxiety problem
W
hen life hands you lemons, make lemonade. This advice sounds a lot 
easier to carry out than it is. Turning a situation around for the better 
after a series of hurts can be tough. Shifting to another metaphor, if you fall 
off your horse, everyone knows that it’s best to jump right back into the 
saddle. But getting back up isn’t always so easy to do either.
This chapter explains how you can get back in the saddle and even make some 
lemonade while you’re up there (sorry). We show you how to overcome your 
fears in manageable steps. You don’t have to face them all at once, because 
taking small steps does the trick. This chapter provides a recipe called expo-
sure for overcoming your personal anxiety problem one step at a time.
Exposure: Coming to Grips 
with Your Fears
No single strategy discussed in this book works more effectively in the fight 
against anxiety than exposure. Simply put, exposure involves putting yourself 
in direct contact with whatever it is that makes you anxious. Well now, that 
may just sound a little ridiculous to you.
After all, it probably makes you feel pretty anxious to even think about star-
ing your fears in the face. We understand that reaction, but please realize 
that if you’re terrified of heights, exposure doesn’t ask you to lean over the 
edge of the Grand Canyon tomorrow. Or if you worry about having a panic 
attack in crowds, you don’t have to sit in the stands of the next Super Bowl as 
your first step.

124
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
Exposure involves a systematic, gradual set of steps that you can tackle one 
at a time. You don’t move from the first step until you master it. Only when 
you’re comfortable with the first step do you move to the second. Each new 
step brings on anxiety, but not an overwhelming amount. The following sec-
tions show you how to create an exposure plan for your own fear.
 
If you find yourself procrastinating with the recommendations in this chapter, 
read Chapter 4 to build motivation and overcome obstacles to change. If you 
still find these ideas difficult to consider, you may want to consult a profes-
sional for help.
 
Don’t try exposure if your anxiety is severe. You’ll need professional guidance. 
If any step raises your anxiety to an extreme level, stop any further attempt 
without help. Also, don’t attempt exposure if you’re in the midst of a crisis or 
have a current problem with alcohol or substance abuse.
Getting ready by relaxing
Before you do anything else, we suggest that you practice relaxing. Consider 
reading Chapters 11 and 12 for a thorough review of how to do this. But for 
now, you can use a couple of simple, quick methods.
Why practice relaxing? Exposure makes you anxious — there’s no way 
around that. Figuring out how to relax can help you feel more confident 
about dealing with that anxiety. Relaxation can help keep the inevitable anxi-
ety within tolerable limits.
 
First, we suggest a breathing strategy:
 
1. Inhale slowly, deeply, and fully through your nose.
 
2. Hold your breath for a slow count of six.
 
3. Slowly breathe out through your lips to a count of eight while making 
a slight hissing or sighing sound as you do.
 
 That sound can be ever so soft.
 
4. Repeat this type of breath ten times.
Try practicing this type of breathing several times a day. See how it makes 
you feel. If it doesn’t help you feel calmer, stop doing it. Instead, try our next 
suggestion, which tightens and loosens muscle groups, an abbreviation of the 
method discussed in Chapter 11.
 
If you have any physical problems, such as low back pain, recent injury, sur-
gery, muscle spasms, or severe arthritic conditions, don’t use the technique 
that follows. Or you can consider it, but do so gently and be sure to avoid 
tensing to the point of pain. Finally, even if you’re in good condition, you 

125
 Chapter 8: Facing Fear One Step at a Time
shouldn’t allow yourself to feel pain when you tighten the muscles in the ways 
that we suggest.
 
1. Find a comfortable place to sit or lie down.
 
2. Loosen any tight clothing.
 
3. Pull your toes up toward your knees, clamp your legs together, and 
tighten all the muscles in your legs and buttocks.
 
4. Hold the tension for a count of eight.
 
5. Now release the tension all at once.
 
6. Allow relaxation to slowly come in and replace the tension.
 
7. Notice the relaxed feeling for a few moments.
 
8. Next, squeeze your fists, bring your hands up to your shoulders, pull 
in your stomach, and pull your shoulder blades back as though you’re 
trying to make them touch. Tighten all the muscles between your 
waist and your neck.
 
9. Hold for eight seconds.
 
10. Repeat Steps 5–7.
 
11. Finally, tense your neck and facial muscles. Scrunch your face into a 
ball.
 
12. Hold the tension for eight seconds.
 
13. Repeat Steps 5–7.
 
14. Sit with the new, relaxed feelings for a few minutes.
 
15. If you still feel tense, repeat the procedure one more time.
Most folks find that one or both of the breathing or the muscle tensing exer-
cise techniques relax them, even if only a little. If, by any chance, these tech-
niques fail to relax you or even make you more anxious, Chapters 11 and 12 
may give you more ideas. Work through those chapters carefully.
However, even if no relaxation technique works for you, it doesn’t mean that 
exposure won’t be effective. Exposure can work on its own. Without relax-
ation, you simply need to proceed especially slowly and carefully.
Understanding your fears
Breaking up the exposure process into manageable steps is important. But 
before you can break your fears into steps, it helps to fully understand the 
nature of what makes you fearful. Try the following strategies:

126
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
 
1. Pick one and only one of your worries.
 
 For example, you might be afraid of one of the following:
 
• Enclosed spaces
 
• Financial ruin
 
• Flying
 
• Having a panic attack (a fear of a fear)
 
• People
 
2. Think about every conceivable aspect of your fear or worry.
 
 What starts up your fear? Include all the activities that surround it. 
For example, if you’re afraid of flying, perhaps you fear driving to the 
airport or packing your luggage. Or if you’re afraid of dogs, you may 
avoid walking near them, and you probably don’t visit people who have 
dogs. Wherever the fear starts, take some notes on it. Think about all 
the anticipated and feared outcomes. Include all the details, like other 
people’s reactions and the setting.
 
3. Ask yourself the following questions and jot down your answers:
 
• How does my anxiety begin?
 
• What activities do I avoid?
 
• What are all the things I’d have to do if I actually faced my fear 
head-on?
 
• What other situations are affected by my fear?
 
• Do I use any crutches to get through my fear? If so, what are they?
 
• What bad outcomes do I anticipate if I were to encounter my fear?
 
 Using the question-answer format, you can describe what you’re afraid 
of. Use your imagination. Don’t let embarrassment keep you from includ-
ing the deepest, darkest aspects of your fears, even if you think they 
may sound silly to someone else.
 
If you find yourself getting anxious while answering the questions above, use 
the relaxation techniques in the preceding section to calm yourself down.
Leeann’s story is a good illustration of how someone completes this exercise 
to enrich her understanding of her fears.
Leeann, a 32-year-old pharmaceutical representative, receives a pro-
motion, which means a large increase in salary and plenty of air travel. 
During her interview, Leeann doesn’t mention her intense fear of flying, 
somehow hoping that it will just go away. Now, in three weeks she faces 
her first flight, and her distress prompts her to seek help.

127
 Chapter 8: Facing Fear One Step at a Time
Lucky for her, Leeann picks up a copy of Overcoming Anxiety For 
Dummies. She reads about exposure and concludes that it’s the best 
approach for her problem. To see how Leeann completes the first task —
understanding her fear and all its components — see Table 8-1.
Table 8-1 
What I’m Afraid Of
Question
Answer
How does my anxiety begin?
The very thought of flying makes me anxious. 
Even driving on the same road that leads to the 
airport gets me worked up.
What activities do I avoid?
I’ve avoided vacations and trips with friends 
and family in order to avoid flying.
What are all the things I’d have 
to do if I actually faced my fear 
head-on?
I’d have to make a reservation. Then, I’d have 
to pack my luggage, drive to the airport, go 
through security, spend some time in the wait-
ing area, hear my flight called, and board the 
plane. Then I’d take a seat and go through take-
off. Finally, I’d endure the flight.
What other situations are 
affected by my fear?
If I don’t get over this, I’ll never get my promo-
tion at work. Not only that, I’ll continue to feel 
embarrassed around friends and family when-
ever the topic comes up. 
Do I use crutches to get 
through my fear? If so, what 
are they?
One time I got on an airplane and got sick to my 
stomach because I’d had too much to drink in 
order to calm my nerves.
What bad outcomes do I an-
ticipate if I were to encounter 
my fear?
I fear that I’d go crazy, throw up on the passen-
gers next to me, or start screaming, and they’d 
have to restrain me. Of course, the plane could 
crash, and then I’d die or suffer horrible burns 
and pain, unable to get out of the plane.
You can see that Leeann’s fear of flying consists of several activities, from 
making a reservation to getting off the plane. Her anticipated outcomes 
include a range of unpleasant possibilities.
Constructing a staircase of fear
The preceding section helps you comprehend the nature of your fears. After 
you come to that understanding, you’re ready to take your fear apart and 
build a staircase. Here’s how to do it:

128
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
 
1. Make a list of each and every single thing you’d have to do if you were 
to ultimately, totally face your fear.
 
 See the third question in Table 8-1 for ideas.
 
2. Rate each one on a scale of 0 to 100.
 
 Zero represents the total absence of fear, and 100 indicates a fear that’s 
unimaginably intense and totally debilitating.
 
3. Arrange the items into a staircase beginning with the lowest-rated 
item at the bottom and ending with the most difficult item on the top 
stair.
 
 This constitutes your exposure hierarchy (another term for staircase). 
Just making your staircase may cause you some anxiety. Again, don’t 
worry; you will approach each step one at a time.
Figure 8-1 shows how Leeann ordered her fear staircase for flying.
 
Figure 8-1: 
How Leeann 
ranks her 
fears about 
flying.
 
Landing (92)
Boarding the plane (88)
Waiting to board (75)
Driving to the airport (65)
Going through security (71)
Checking in (68)
Packing (48)
Making a reservation (28)
Visiting the airport without ﬂying (20)
Taking off (92)
 
Leeann’s staircase contains only ten steps. You may want to break the task 
down into 15 or 20 steps. For example, Leeann could add an in-between step 
or two, such as planning her trip or parking in the airport garage.
For a phobia like Leeann’s, the steps represent tasks that all directly lead 
to her ultimate fear. But some people have different types of anxiety. For 
example, someone with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; see Chapter 2) 
may have a variety of fears — fear of rejection, fear of getting hurt, and worry 
about financial calamity. The best staircase of fear chooses one of those fears 
and includes everything associated with that fear.
So, now you have your staircase of fear. What do you do next? Choose between 
the two kinds of exposure — the kind that occurs in your imagination and the 
exposure that occurs in real life. In a sense, you get to pick your poison.

129
 Chapter 8: Facing Fear One Step at a Time
Imagining the worst
Many times, the best way to begin exposure is through your imagination. 
That’s because imagining your fears usually produces less anxiety than 
confronting them directly. In addition, you can use your imagination when 
it would be impossible to re-create your real fear. For example, if you fear 
getting a disease, such as Hepatitis C, actually exposing yourself to the virus 
wouldn’t be a good idea.
You may think that viewing your fears through your mind’s eye won’t make you 
anxious. However, most people find that when they picture their fears in rich 
detail, their bodies react. As they gradually master their fears in their minds, the 
fears are generally reduced accordingly when they confront the real McCoy.
Imaginary exposure follows just a few basic steps:
 
1. Before you start, try getting more comfortable by using one of the 
brief relaxation strategies we describe earlier in this chapter.
 
 See the section “Getting ready by relaxing.”
 
2. Choose the lowest step from your staircase of fear.
 
3. Picture yourself as though you’re actually confronting your fear.
 
 Leeann’s was visiting the airport without any intention of flying.
 
4. Imagine as many details about your fear step as you can — the sights, 
sounds, smells, and anything else that brings your imaginary experi-
ence to life.
 
 If you have difficulty picturing the experience, see Chapter 12 for ideas 
on how to sharpen your mind’s eye.
 
5. After you have a good picture in your mind of what being exposed to 
your fear would be like, rate your anxiety on a scale of 0 to 100.
 
6. Keep the picture in your mind until you feel your anxiety drop 
significantly.
 
 Waiting until your rating decreases by around half or more is best. It will 
come down that much as long as you stay with the imaginary exposure 
long enough. For example, if you experience anxiety at a level of 60, keep 
thinking about the exposure until it drops to around 30.
 
7. Finish the session with a brief relaxation technique (see Step 1).
 
8. If the imaginary experience went easily, you may want to try the next 
step up in your staircase of fear, and perhaps another one after that. 
Continue daily practice.
 
 Always start with the last step that you completed successfully (in other 
words, one where your anxiety level dropped by half or more).

130
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
Facing your fears (gulp)
Although we usually recommend starting exposure in the imagination, the 
most effective type of exposure happens in real life. The strategy works in 
much the same way as imaginary exposure; you break your fears down into 
small steps and arrange them into a staircase of fear from the least problem-
atic to the most intensely feared. It’s just that these steps all happen through 
action, not in your imagination as in the previous section. Now, it’s time to 
face your fears head-on. Gulp.
 
1. Start with a brief relaxation procedure, such as the ones we describe 
in the earlier section, “Getting ready by relaxing.”
 
2. Select a fear or a group of worries with a similar theme.
 
 For example, fear of rejection is a theme that involves lots of worries 
about criticism and evaluation by others. Similarly, anxiety about per-
sonal injury is a theme that involves a variety of fears about safety.
 
3. Break the fear into a number of sequential steps, with each step being 
slightly more difficult than the prior step.
 
4. Take one step at a time, and keep working on each step until your 
anxiety drops, generally by at least 50 percent.
 
 If your anxiety starts to rise to an unmanageable level, try using one of 
the brief relaxation techniques from Step 1.
 
The following hints can help you get through the exposure process:
 
✓ Enlist the help of an exposure buddy, but only if you have someone you 
really trust. This person can give you encouragement and support.
 
✓ If you must, back off your step just a little. Don’t make a complete 
retreat unless you feel absolutely out of control.
 
✓ Your mind will tell you, “Stop! You can’t do this. It won’t work anyway.” 
Don’t listen to this chatter. Simply study your body’s reactions and real-
ize that they won’t harm you.
 
✓ Find a way to reward yourself for each successful step you take. Perhaps 
indulge in a desired purchase or treat yourself in some other way. For 
example, you could put a few bucks in a shoebox each time you com-
plete a step with a goal of rewarding yourself with a larger treat after 
you’ve made substantial progress.
 
✓ Use a little positive self-talk to help quell rising anxiety, if you need to. 
See Chapter 5 for ideas.
 
✓ Understand that at times, you will feel uncomfortable. View that discom-
fort as progress; it’s part of how you overcome your fears.
 
✓ Practice, practice, practice.

131
 Chapter 8: Facing Fear One Step at a Time
 
✓ Don’t forget to practice brief relaxation before and during the exposure.
 
✓ Remember to stay with each step until your anxiety drops. Realize that 
your body can’t maintain anxiety forever. It will come down if you give it 
enough time.
 
✓ Don’t expect an instant cure. Proceed at a reasonable pace. Keep moving 
forward, but don’t expect to conquer your fear in a few days. Even with 
daily practice, exposure can take a number of months.
 
Remember to set realistic goals. For example, say you’re afraid of spiders — 
so much so that you can’t enter a room without an exhaustive search for 
hidden horrors. You don’t have to perform exposure exercises to the point 
where you let tarantulas crawl up and down your arms. Let yourself feel satis-
fied with the ability to enter rooms without unnecessary checking.
 
Try to avoid using crutches to avoid fully exposing yourself to the steps in 
your staircase of fear. Some of the popular crutches that people use include 
the following:
 
✓ Drinking alcohol
 
✓ Taking tranquilizers, especially the benzodiazepines we discuss in 
Chapter 9
 
✓ Distracting themselves with rituals, song lyrics, or chants
 
✓ Holding onto something to keep from fainting
 
✓ Asking someone else to reassure you that everything will be okay if you 
carry out a step on your staircase
All of these crutches actually interfere with the effectiveness of exposure. But 
if you absolutely feel the need to use one of these crutches, use as little as 
you can. Sometimes a reasonable in-between step is to use lyrics or chants at 
first, and then make the next step in your staircase of fear the same activity 
without the chants.
 
In your later steps, it’s good to drop even relaxation and self-talk as ways to 
completely master your fear.
Conquering All Types of Fears
Confronting your fears directly is one of the most powerful ways of overcom-
ing them. But your exposure plan can look different, depending on the partic-
ular type of anxiety you have. This section lays out example plans for seven 
types of anxiety. You’ll no doubt need to individualize these for dealing with 
your problem. However, they should help you get started.

132
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
You may want to review the descriptions of the seven major types of anxiety 
in detail in Chapter 2. The list that follows offers a brief synopsis of each anxi-
ety category for which we suggest the use of real-life exposure:
 
✓ Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): A chronic, long-lasting state of 
tension and worry.
 
✓ Social phobia: A fear of rejection, humiliation, or negative judgment 
from others.
 
✓ Specific phobia: An exaggerated, intense fear of some specific object, 
an animal, spiders, needles, or a situation, such as being high off the 
ground (acrophobia).
 
✓ Panic disorder: A fear of experiencing repeated panic attacks in which you 
feel a variety of physical symptoms, such as lightheadedness, racing heart-
beat, or nausea. You may also fear losing control, dying, or going crazy.
 
✓ Agoraphobia: This problem often, but not always, accompanies panic 
disorder. You worry about leaving home, which leaves you feeling 
trapped or unable to get help if you should need it. People with agora-
phobia often avoid crowds, traffic, and even leaving the house.
 
✓ Post-traumatic stress disorder: This problem occurs after experiencing 
a highly threatening, traumatic event. Symptoms usually include recur-
rent flashbacks, a sense of re-experiencing the trauma, and avoidance of 
reminders of the event.
 
✓ Obsessive-compulsive disorder: Repetitive, unwanted thoughts jump 
into your mind and disturb you. It can also involve various actions or 
rituals that you do repeatedly as a way to prevent something bad from 
happening. However, these actions don’t make much sense.
Waging war on worry: GAD
People with generalized anxiety disorder worry about most everything. As a 
result of that worry, they usually end up avoiding a variety of opportunities 
and other tasks of everyday life. These worries can rob their victims of plea-
sure and enjoyment.
Maureen’s story shows you how someone with GAD tackles her worries with 
a staircase of fear.
Maureen’s friends call her a worrywart, and her children call her “the 
prison guard.” Maureen frets constantly, but her biggest worry is the 
safety of her 16-year-old twin boys. Unfortunately, Maureen’s worry 
causes her to restrict her kids’ activities far more than most parents do. 
She doesn’t allow them out of the house after dark, so they can’t par-
ticipate in extracurricular activities. Maureen interrogates them about 
every new friend. As the kids get older, they rebel. Squabbles and fights 
dominate dinner, but the biggest bone of contention revolves around 

133
 Chapter 8: Facing Fear One Step at a Time
learning to drive. Although both are eligible to take driver’s education, 
Maureen declares that they can’t drive until they’re at least 18 years old.
Maureen is surprised when the school counselor calls her to discuss her 
sons’ concerns. He meets with her for a few sessions and helps Maureen 
to realize that her worries are overblown. She knows she has a problem 
and decides to tackle it head-on.
After helping her understand that her worries are over the top, the coun-
selor suggests that Maureen talk to other parents at her church to get a 
reality check. She finds out that most parents allow their 16-year-old kids 
to attend supervised evening activities, to take driver’s education, and 
even drive if they maintain good grades.
Maureen constructs her staircase of fear, stacking the steps from the 
least fearful to the most terrifying (see Figure 8-2). She rates the anxiety 
that each step causes her on a 1-to-100-point scale. Then she rates her 
anxiety again with repeated exposures. She doesn’t go to the next step 
until her anxiety comes down about 50 percent.

Allowing her sons to get a driver’s license (90)
Although we only show six steps, Maureen’s entire staircase of fear actually 
consists of 20 steps. She tries to make sure that each step is within five to ten 
anxiety points of the previous one.
If you have GAD, pick one of your various worries. Then construct your per-
sonal staircase of fear to address that particular worry.
 
Construct your staircase with enough steps so that the steps are small. If you 
find one step insurmountable, try coming up with an in-between step. If you 
can’t do that, try taking the tough step through repeated imaginary exposures 
before tackling it in real life.
Fighting specific and social phobias
You fight both specific and social phobias in pretty much the same way. Take 
the feared situation, object, animal, or whatever, and approach it in gradu-
ated steps. Again, you construct a staircase of fear consisting of a series of 

134
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
small steps. Ruben’s story is a good example of how the staircase of fear can 
help someone with a specific phobia — a fear of heights.
Ruben meets Diane through a dating Web site. They text back and forth 
for several weeks. Finally, they decide to meet for coffee. Several hours 
pass in what seems like minutes to both of them, and Ruben offers to 
walk Diane home.
As he holds the restaurant door open for her, her body brushes against 
him. Their eyes meet, and Ruben almost kisses her right there in the 
doorway. As they walk toward her apartment building, she asks, “Do you 
believe in love at first sight?” Ruben doesn’t hesitate, “Yes,” he answers, 
wrapping her in his arms. The kiss is so intense that Ruben thinks he 
might collapse on the spot.
“I’ve never done this before on a first date, but I think I’d like you to come 
up to my place,” Diane says, as she strokes his arm. “I have a wonderful 
view of the entire city from my penthouse apartment.”
Ruben looks up at the 25-story apartment building. His desire shrinks. 
“Ah, well, I’ve got to pick up Mom, I mean the cat at the vet,” he stam-
mers. Diane, obviously hurt and surprised, snaps, “Fine. I’ve really got to 
wash my socks.”
Ruben decides to fight his phobia. He constructs a staircase of fear (see 
Figure 8-3) out of steps that start at the bottom and go all the way to the 
most fearful step at the top.

135
 Chapter 8: Facing Fear One Step at a Time
Confessing his problem to Diane is a step that may appear unrelated to 
Ruben’s fear. However, not admitting to his fear is avoidance, which only 
fuels fear. Including any step that’s connected to your fear is good. Ruben 
also included steps in his staircase that required him to use his imagination 
to face his fear. It’s fine to do that. Sometimes, imaginary steps can help you 
take the next behavioral step.
 
Imagining the real-life steps before actually doing them doesn’t hurt and will 
likely help prepare you for the real thing.
Pushing through panic and agoraphobia
Some people have panic disorder without agoraphobia, others have both, 
and still others have agoraphobia without a history of panic disorder. 
Whether you have one or both of these problems, you can approach them 
in much the same way. That’s because both panic attacks and agoraphobia 
usually have predictable triggers. Those triggers can form the basis for your 
staircase of fear. Tanya’s story depicts how someone who has panic disorder 
with agoraphobia builds a staircase of fear.
Tanya experiences her first panic attack shortly after the birth of her 
baby. Always somewhat shy, she begins to worry about something hap-
pening to herself when she takes the baby out. She fears that she might 
faint or lose control, leaving the baby vulnerable to harm.
Her panic attacks start with a feeling of nervousness and sweaty palms, 
and then progress to shallow, rapid breathing, a racing heartbeat, light-
headedness, and a sense of dread and doom. Trips away from the house 
trigger her attacks, and the more crowded the destination, the more 
likely she is to experience panic. By six months after her first attack, she 
rarely leaves the house without her husband.
One day, Tanya’s baby girl develops a serious fever, and she needs to 
take her to the emergency room. Panic overtakes her; she frantically calls 
her husband, but he’s out on a business call. Desperate, she calls 911 to 
send an ambulance, which she and her husband can’t afford on their lim-
ited budget.
Tanya knows that she must do something about her panic disorder 
and its companion, agoraphobia. She constructs a staircase of fear (see 
Figure 8-4) out of a set of steps, starting with the least problematic and 
progressing to the most difficult goal.
Notice that Tanya’s staircase of fear contains quite a few steps between 80 
and her top item of 98. That’s because she needs to make each step very 
gradual to have the courage to proceed. She could make the steps even 
smaller, if necessary.

You can break your staircase of fear down into as many small steps as you 
need to avoid feeling overwhelmed by taking any single step.
Another type of exposure that aims specifically at panic attacks involves 
experiencing the sensations of the attacks themselves. How do you do that? 
You repeatedly and intentionally bring them on through a number of strate-
gies, as follows:
 
✓ Running in place: This accelerates your heartbeat, just as many panic 
attacks do. Run for at least three to five minutes.
 
✓ Spinning yourself around until you feel dizzy: Panic attacks often 
include sensations of dizziness and lightheadedness.
 
✓ Breathing through a small cocktail straw: This strategy induces sensa-
tions of not getting enough air, which also mimics panic. Try this for a 
good 60 seconds at a time.
 
✓ Putting your head between your knees and rising up suddenly: You 
may feel lightheaded or dizzy.
After you experience these physical sensations repeatedly, you discover 
that they don’t harm you. You won’t go crazy, have a heart attack, or lose 
control. Frequent, prolonged exposures tell your mind that sensations are 
just sensations.

137
 Chapter 8: Facing Fear One Step at a Time
 
Don’t bring on these physical sensations if you have a serious heart condition 
or any other physical problem that could be exacerbated by the exercise. For 
example, if you have asthma or a back injury, some of these strategies are ill-
advised. Check with your doctor if you have any questions or concerns.
Taking on post-traumatic stress disorder
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often occurs following a traumatic 
event in a person’s life. We’re seeing a rise in PTSD nowadays. That’s partly 
because of good news — due to improved medical care, we’re more able to 
keep people alive when they encounter wars, terrorism, accidents, natural 
disasters, and violence. However, PTSD can haunt people for years after their 
traumas occur.
 
The vast majority of people with PTSD are best served by seeking professional 
help that guides them carefully through their staircase of fear. We provide a 
sample staircase for PTSD as an illustration, but we don’t advise trying it on 
your own.
People can acquire PTSD by directly experiencing horrible, life-threatening 
events or even by witnessing such events happen to others. Amihan’s story 
illustrates how someone can end up with PTSD from observing the aftermath 
of a natural disaster.
Amihan, a young nurse from the Philippines, arrives in New Orleans six 
months before hurricane Katrina hits. She enjoys her job in the intensive 
care unit and makes friends with the other nurses easily. She also feels 
privileged to be able to send much-needed money home to her family.
On the day of the hurricane, her hospital survives the wind and is initially 
able to function on auxiliary power. But when floodwaters fill the ground 
floor, the power goes out. That’s when mayhem breaks loose. The tem-
perature rapidly climbs into the high 90s, compounded by unbearable 
humidity.
Patients stream into her unit. She sees people with exposed bones, burns 
covering 90 percent of their bodies, horrific injuries from projectiles 
launched by the hurricane’s winds, and some people who were savagely 
attacked by other survivors. Those who are conscious either moan or 
scream in agony. Still others lay still, barely clinging to life. The number 
of patients overwhelms the staff’s ability to attend to them. The stench 
from unwashed bodies, open wounds, burned flesh, feces, urine, and 
sewer water gags her. She stays on the job three days without sleep or 
rest.

138
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
Amihan sees a psychologist a few months later for treatment of her night-
mares, isolation from others, irritability, intrusive images that bombard 
her mind, and her inability to return to work. She’s desperately fearful 
that she’ll be deported if she can’t go back to her job. Her psychologist 
diagnoses her with PTSD and develops a staircase of fear. Her staircase 
(see Figure 8-5) has a number of gruesome images and scenes. Yet, by 
working through the steps, she slowly but surely regains much of her 
emotional well-being.
 
Figure 8-5: 
Amihan’s 
staircase 
of fear 
includes 
more than a 
dozen steps.

Going out with her friends and telling them what has happened to her (50)
Going out with several friends for lunch (40)
Going out with a close friend for coffee (35)
You should know that Figure 8-5 is a partial list of the items that Amihan dealt 
with. She actually went through more than 25 items, one at a time. Note that 
a few items involve going out with friends and don’t seemingly have much to 
do with her trauma. That’s because PTSD often causes people to avoid more 
than just reminders of the traumatic event itself — sometimes it includes 
avoiding friends and family. Treatment for severe PTSD like Amihan’s often 
takes longer than treatment of milder anxiety disorders.

 Chapter 8: Facing Fear One Step at a Time
Overriding an obsessive-compulsive 
disorder
 
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) sometimes overwhelms and dominates 
a person’s life, and the help of an experienced professional is commonly 
required to treat this disorder. Only attempt the strategies that we describe in 
this section on your own if your problems with OCD are relatively mild. Even 
then, you may want to enlist a friend or partner to help you. Furthermore, you 
may want to read Obsessive Compulsive Disorder For Dummies (Wiley), which 
we also wrote.
Chapter 2 discusses this disorder, which often starts with obsessive, unwanted 
thoughts that create anxiety. People with this problem then try to relieve the 
anxiety caused by their thoughts by performing one of a number of compulsive 
acts. Unfortunately, it seems that the relief obtained from the compulsive acts 
only fuels the vicious cycle and keeps it going.
Therefore, for obsessive-compulsive disorder, exposure is only the first step. 
Then you must do something even harder — prevent the compulsive, anxiety-
relieving actions. This strategy is called exposure and response prevention (or 
ERP).
The first step, exposure, deals with the obsessional component of OCD — 
feared thoughts, images, and impulses. The exposure is often imaginary (see 
the earlier section “Imagining the worst”). This may be the only strategy you 
can use if your obsessions can’t or shouldn’t be acted out in real life, as in 
the following examples:
 
✓ Thoughts that tell you to violate your personal religious beliefs
 
✓ Repetitive thoughts of harm coming to a family member or loved one
 
✓ Frequent worries about burning alive in a home fire
 
✓ Unwanted thoughts about getting cancer or some other dreaded disease
Proceed as follows:
 
1. List your distressing thoughts and images, and then rate each one for 
the amount of distress it causes.
 
2. Next, select the thought that causes the least upset, and dwell on that 
thought over and over, ad nauseam, until your distress drops at least 
50 percent.
 
 Sometimes, listening over and over to a recorded description of your 
obsession is useful.

140
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
 
3. Then proceed to the next item on your list that causes a little more 
discomfort. Keep working your way up the list.
This approach is quite the opposite of what people with OCD usually do 
with their unwanted obsessions. Normally, they try to sweep the haunting 
thoughts out of their minds the moment they appear, but that only succeeds 
ever so briefly, and it maintains the cycle.
 
Give imaginary exposure enough time — keep the thoughts and images in 
your head long enough for your anxiety to reduce at least 50 percent before 
moving to the next item.
If you also suffer from compulsive acts or avoidance due to obsessive thoughts, 
it’s now time for the more difficult, second step — response prevention. Again, 
make a staircase or hierarchy of feared events and situations that you typically 
avoid: a staircase of fear. Then proceed to put yourself in each of those situa-
tions, but don’t allow yourself to perform the compulsive act.
For example, if you fear contamination from dirt and grime, go to a beach, 
play in the sand, and build sand castles, or go out in the garden, plant flow-
ers, and keep yourself from washing your hands. Remain in the situation until 
your distress drops by 50 percent. If it doesn’t drop that much, stay at least 
90 minutes and try not to quit until a minimum of a third of your distress 
goes away. Don’t proceed to the next item until you conquer the one you’re 
working on.
 
Although using relaxation procedures with initial exposure attempts is a good 
idea, you shouldn’t use relaxation with exposure and response prevention for 
OCD as you proceed further. That’s because one of the crucial lessons is that 
your anxiety will come down if and only if you give exposure enough time. 
Furthermore, some people with OCD actually start to use relaxation as a com-
pulsive ritual itself. Thus, it’s fine if you want to practice a little relaxation for 
anxieties not related to your OCD, but don’t use it with exposure and response 
prevention.
Preparing for exposure and response prevention
Prior to actual exposure and response prevention, you may find it useful 
to alter your compulsive rituals in ways that start to disrupt and alter their 
influence over you. Methods for initiating this assault on compulsions 
include:
 
✓ Delay performing your ritual when you first feel the urge. For example, 
if you have a strong compulsion to wipe the doorknobs and the phones 
with Lysol, try putting it off for at least 30 minutes. The next day, try to 
delay acting on your urge for 45 minutes.

141
 Chapter 8: Facing Fear One Step at a Time
 
✓ Carry out your compulsion at a much slower pace than usual. For exam-
ple, if you feel compelled to arrange items in a perfect row, go ahead and 
do it, but lay them out with excruciating slowness.
 
✓ Change your compulsion in some way. If it’s a ritual, change the number 
of times that you do it. If it involves a sequence of checking all the door 
locks in the house, try doing them in a completely different order than 
usual.
Seeing exposure and response prevention in action
Cindy’s story shows how someone with OCD begins to face her fears one step 
at a time.
Cindy obsesses incessantly about getting ill from dirt, germs, and pesti-
cides. Whenever she imagines that she has come into contact with any 
of these to the slightest degree, she feels compelled to wash her hands 
thoroughly, first with soap containing pumice to scrape off the dirty layer 
of skin, and then with antibacterial soap to kill the germs. Unfortunately, 
this ritual leaves her hands cracked, sore, and bleeding. When she goes 
out into public, she wears gloves to hide the self-inflicted damage. Not 
only that, she’s discovering that her hand-washing consumes increasing 
amounts of time. Her 15-minute breaks at work are too short to complete 
her hand-washing ritual. Cindy finally decides to do something about her 
problem when her supervisor at work tells her that she must take shorter 
breaks. Cindy prepares for her exposure and response prevention exer-
cise by doing the following first for a week:
 
• She delays washing her hands for 30 minutes when she feels the 
urge. Later, she delays washing for 45 minutes.
 
• She changes her washing by using a different type of soap and 
starting with the rubbing alcohol instead of ending with it.
Cindy is surprised to find that these changes make her hand-washing 
urges a little less frequent, but they haven’t exactly disappeared, and 
they continue to cause considerable distress. She needs to muster up the 
courage to do exposure and response prevention.
First, she approaches Dolores, a trusted friend, for help. She tells Dolores 
about her problem and asks her to coach her through the exercises by 
lending support and encouragement. Then she makes a staircase of fear 
for her exposure and response prevention that includes touching the 
“dirty dozen” depicted in Figure 8-6.
Dolores helps Cindy with her staircase of fear by having her start with 
the easiest step: touching a telephone receiver that someone else has 
used. She has Cindy do this a number of times and encourages her to 
resist the urge to wash her hands. After an hour and a half, the urge to 
wash drops significantly. The next day, Dolores has Cindy take on the 
next step.

The seat of a chair that a healthy person sat on (60)

Cans of pesticide (92)
Each day they tackle one new step if Cindy succeeds the previous day. 
When she gets to touching the cat’s litter box, Cindy balks at first. 
Dolores says she won’t “make” Cindy do it, but she thinks it just might 
help her. In other words, she urges her on. The cat litter box takes many 
attempts. Finally, Cindy manages to touch it and stay with it. However, it 
takes a total of three hours of repeatedly attempting to touch and finally 
touching the litter box numerous times for as long as ten minutes each 
time for her anxiety to come down by half.
 
Sometimes exposure and response prevention takes a while, so set plenty of 
time aside. In Cindy’s case, the final two items didn’t require as much effort 
because her earlier work had seemingly cracked the compulsion enough so 
that it lost some of its power over her.
Upping the ante
After she gets through her staircase of fear, Cindy takes one more initia-
tive. She tackles the toughest steps again. But this time, she asks Dolores 
to describe scenes of Cindy getting sick and dying a slow death from some 
dreaded disease because of her contamination, while Cindy is actually doing 
the exposure task.
We call this “upping the ante.” It gives you the opportunity to practice your 
exposure while bombarding yourself with your worst fears. Why in the world 
would you want to do that? Mainly because doing so reduces the grip those 

143
 Chapter 8: Facing Fear One Step at a Time
fears have on you. Of course, that’s true if and only if you stay with the expo-
sure, along with the dreaded outcome pictured in your mind, long enough.
 
If you can’t do this on your own or with a friend fairly easily, please consult 
a professional for help. Make sure that professional is well acquainted with 
using exposure and response prevention for OCD (not everyone is).
 
If you get stuck on exposure and response prevention, you may want to care-
fully work through Chapters 5, 6, and 7. Pay particular attention to the section 
on rethinking risk. Usually, those with OCD overestimate the odds of cata-
strophic outcomes if they halt their compulsions, and these chapters can help 
you recalculate the odds.
Expecting the Impossible
Occasionally, people come to us asking for a quick fix for their anxiety prob-
lems. It’s as though they think we have some magic wand we can pass over 
them to make everything better. That would be so nice, but it isn’t realistic.
Other folks hope that with help, they’ll rid themselves of all anxiety — 
another misconception. Some anxiety helps prepare you for action, warn you 
of danger, and mobilize your resources (see Chapter 3). The only people who 
are completely rid of anxiety are unconscious or dead.
Overcoming anxiety requires effort and some discomfort. We have no way 
around that. No magic wand. But we know that those who undertake the chal-
lenge, make the effort, and suffer the discomfort are rewarded with reduced 
anxiety and increased confidence.

Considering Medications and 
Other Physical Treatment Options
In This Chapter
▶ Deciding whether to take medication
▶ Knowing what medication choices are available
▶ Looking at supplements
▶ Seeing some stimulating possibilities
T
he last several decades have witnessed an explosion in new knowledge 
about emotions, mental illness, and brain chemistry. Scientists recognize 
changes in the brain that accompany many psychological disorders. New 
and old drugs address these chemical imbalances, and using these drugs has 
both advantages and disadvantages.
This chapter helps you make an informed decision about whether or not to 
use medication for your anxiety. We give you information about the most 
widely prescribed drugs and some of their more common side effects. Only 
you, in consultation with your healthcare provider, can determine what’s 
best for helping you. Next, we tell you about over-the-counter supplements 
for anxiety. More importantly, we share with you the latest information about 
their effectiveness and warn you about possible dangers and downsides. 
Finally, we alert you to some of the methods that involve stimulating the 
brain for those whose anxiety is severe and resistant to standard treatments.
Making Up Your Mind About 
Medications
Deciding whether to medicate your anxiety brings up a number of issues to 
consider. This decision isn’t one to take lightly. You should consult with your 
therapist, if you have one, as well as your physician. Before you decide on 
medication, ask yourself what you’ve done to alleviate your anxiety. Have you 

146
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
challenged your anxious thoughts and beliefs (see Chapters 5, 6, and 7)? Have 
you faced your fears head-on (see Chapter 8)? And have you looked at lifestyle 
changes, relaxation strategies, or mindfulness techniques (see Part III)?
 
With a few important exceptions, which we review in this chapter, we recom-
mend that you try various psychological approaches prior to adding medica-
tion. Why? Consider the following:
 
✓ Some research suggests that certain medications may actually interfere 
with the long-term effectiveness of the most successful treatments for 
anxiety. That’s especially true of the techniques designed to confront 
phobias and fears directly through exposure.
 
✓ If you try psychological strategies first, you very well may discover that 
you don’t need medication. Many of our recommended anxiety axes 
have the potential to cement change for the long haul as well as posi-
tively affect your entire life.
 
✓ Studies show that cognitive behavioral therapy (the type of strategies 
we discuss throughout this book) helps prevent relapse. Many people 
who take medication alone experience a quick reoccurrence of symp-
toms when they discontinue taking medication for any reason.
The downside of medications
You need to reflect on both sides of any important decision. Medications 
have an upside and a downside. The negative side of the argument includes:
 
✓ Addiction: Some medications can lead to physical and/or mental depen-
dency. Getting off of those medications can be difficult, or even danger-
ous, if not done properly. (However, contrary to what some people think, 
many medications are available that do not have addictive potential.)
 
✓ Long-term effects: We don’t really have good information on possible 
long-term effects with some of the newest medications. And some medi-
cations can lead to serious problems, such as diabetes and tremors.
 
✓ Philosophical aversions: Some people just feel strongly that they don’t 
like to take medications. And that’s okay, but only to a point.
 
✓ Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Only a few drugs are recommended for 
women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. The potential effects on the 
baby or fetus are just too risky for most situations.
 
✓ Side effects: Most medications have various side effects, such as gastro-
intestinal upset, headaches, dizziness, dry mouth, and sexual dysfunc-
tion. Working with your physician to find the right medication — a drug 
that alleviates your anxiety and doesn’t cause you overly troublesome 
side effects — may take some time.

147
 Chapter 9: Considering Medications and Other Physical Treatment Options
The upside of medications
Sometimes medications make good sense. In weighing the pros and cons, we 
suggest that you take a good look at the benefits that medications can offer:
 
✓ When serious depression accompanies anxiety, medication can some-
times provide faster relief, especially when a person feels hopeless, 
helpless, or suicidal.
 
✓ When anxiety severely interferes with your life, medication sometimes 
provides relief more quickly than therapy or lifestyle changes. Such 
interferences include:
 
• Panic attacks that occur frequently and cause expensive trips to 
the emergency room.
 
• Anxiety that feels so severe that you stop going to work or miss 
out on important life events.
 
• Compulsions and obsessions (see Chapter 2) that take control of 
your life and consume large blocks of time.
 
✓ When you’ve tried the recommendations in this book, consulted a quali-
fied therapist, and you still suffer from excessive anxiety, medication 
may provide relief.
 
✓ If your physician tells you that your stress level must be controlled 
quickly to control your high blood pressure, that blood pressure medi-
cation may, in a few cases, also reduce your stress, in addition to adding 
a few years to your life.
 
✓ When you experience a sudden, traumatic event, a brief regimen of the 
right medication may help you get through it. Traumas that happen to 
most people at one time or another include
 
• The sudden death of a loved one
 
• An unexpected accident
 
• Severe illness
 
• An unexpected financial disaster
 
• A natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake
 
• Being the victim of a serious crime
 
• Being the victim of terrorism
Understanding Medication Options
Today, physicians have a wide range of medications for the treatment of anxi-
ety disorders. New drugs and applications appear all the time. Don’t expect 

148

our list to cover every possible medication for anxiety. In addition, our 
review is not intended to replace professional medical advice.
 
If you decide to ask your doctor about medication, don’t forget to discuss the 
following critical issues if they apply to you. Communicating with your doctor 
about these considerations can help prevent a bad outcome. Be sure to tell 
your doctor if you
 
✓ Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant
 
✓ Are breast-feeding
 
✓ Drink alcohol
 
✓ Take any other prescription drugs
 
✓ Take any over-the-counter medications
 
✓ Take herbs or supplements
 
✓ Have any serious medical conditions
 
✓ Have had any bad reactions to medications in the past
 
✓ Have any allergies
 
✓ Take birth control pills (some medications for anxiety reduce their 
effectiveness)
Most drugs prescribed for anxiety belong to one of the following categories. 
In addition to a few intriguing medication options, we discuss the following:
 
✓ Antidepressants
 
✓ Benzodiazepines (minor tranquilizers)
 
✓ Miscellaneous tranquilizers
 
✓ Beta blockers
 
✓ Atypical antipsychotics
 
✓ Mood stabilizers
You may notice that some of these categories sound a little strange. For 
example, antidepressants (typically used to treat depression) and beta 
blockers (generally prescribed for hypertension) don’t sound like groups of 
medications for the treatment of anxiety. But we show you that they play an 
important role with certain types of anxiety.
Antidepressants
Antidepressant medications have been used to treat anxiety for many 
decades. That’s interesting, because anxiety and depression often occur 

149
 Chapter 9: Considering Medications and Other Physical Treatment Options
together. And both problems appear to have some similarity in terms of 
their biological underpinnings. Antidepressants increase the availability of 
different neurotransmitters or chemical messengers in the brain. The most 
frequently prescribed antidepressants increase the levels of serotonin, which 
helps regulate mood, anxiety, and the ability to control impulses.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
Doctors prescribe SSRIs for all types of anxiety disorders (see Chapter 2 for a 
description of anxiety disorders). The SSRIs increase the levels of the critical 
neurotransmitter serotonin at the nerve synapses by inhibiting the reabsorp-
tion of serotonin into the nerve cells. You should know that SSRIs still have 
significant side effects, though they tend to be milder than earlier types of 
antidepressants and some ease with time.
 
Side effects from SSRIs can include sedation, stomach upset, headaches, dizzi-
ness, weight gain, insomnia, restlessness, irritability, sexual problems, unusual 
behaviors, and even thoughts of suicide. Talk to your prescribing professional 
about any and all side effects. And get help immediately if you feel suicidal.
 
SSRIs can interact with other drugs and, in rare cases, can cause life-threatening 
interactions. Be sure to tell your doctor about all medications or over-the-
counter supplements you’re taking.
See Table 9-1 for a listing of the popular SSRIs.

Designer antidepressants
This class of antidepressants targets serotonin and other neurotransmitters 
that have various kinds of effects. Some of these neurotransmitters boost 
energy and alertness while others affect experiences of pleasure, motivation, 
and attention. Table 9-2 lists these medications alphabetically within their 
respective categories.

tion and anxiety are 
common side effects: Be 
sure to let your doctor 
know if you experience 
increased distress with 
this medication.
Tricyclic antidepressants
Doctors usually try to treat anxiety with the newer antidepressant medica-
tions discussed in the previous two sections. However, when those medi-
cations don’t do the trick, sometimes the tricyclic antidepressants work. 
Tricyclic antidepressants can take anywhere from two to twelve weeks to 
exert maximum effectiveness.
 
Some people temporarily experience increased anxiety with tricyclic medica-
tions. In large part due to side effects that can increase anxiety and agitation, 
nearly 30 percent of patients discontinue taking tricyclic antidepressants.

152
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
That’s why many physicians prescribe medication for anxiety disorders by 
starting with a low dosage and slowly increasing it as necessary. In other 
words, they prescribe a very low dose initially in order for your body to 
adjust to it with minimal side effects. They gradually increase the dosage in 
order to minimize negative reactions. It can take a while to reach an effective 
dose this way, but you’ll probably find yourself able to tolerate the medica-
tion more easily.
Even with careful dosing, tricyclic medications can cause considerable side 
effects, including dizziness, weight gain, dry mouth, blurred vision, and con-
stipation. Some of these effects resolve over time, but many of them persist 
even after several weeks. Tricyclics have lost some of their popularity to 
the newer SSRIs we describe earlier, because the SSRIs have fewer of these 
annoying side effects.
Common tricyclic medications include Tofranil, Elavil, Adapin, Pamelor, and 
Anafranil (prescribed especially for obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD] 
and panic disorder, because it has a different mechanism of action on the 
brain than the other tricyclic medications).
MAO inhibitors
MAO inhibitors are the oldest type of antidepressant medication. MAO inhibi-
tors work by allowing critical neurotransmitters to remain available in the 
brain to effectively regulate mood. MAO inhibitors are used infrequently 
because they have serious side effects.
 
Taking MAO inhibitors and consuming foods with tyramine can trigger a 
dangerous spike in blood pressure leading to stroke or death. Unfortunately, 
many foods, such as avocados, beer, cheese, salami, soy, wine, and tomatoes, 
contain tyramine.
Saving your sex life?
Many medications for the treatment of anxiety, 
as well as depression, interfere with arousal 
and the ability to achieve an orgasm. The worst 
offenders in this group of medications are the 
SSRIs. Many folks taking these medications are 
so pleased with their reduced anxiety that they 
hesitate to complain to their doctors about this 
side effect. Others are just too embarrassed to 
bring it up.
You should know that this side effect is 
extremely common, and your doctor has no 
doubt heard many patients report this problem. 
So go ahead and talk with your doctor — no 
need for embarrassment. Certain medications 
have a lower tendency to cause this side effect 
than others, so your doctor may recommend 
a switch. Alternatively, medications such as 
Viagra may be used to treat some of the sexual 
side effects directly. By talking to your doctor, 
you can explore the best options.

153
 Chapter 9: Considering Medications and Other Physical Treatment Options
Nevertheless, MAO inhibitors can be effective when other antidepressants 
haven’t worked. If your doctor prescribes one of them for you, he probably 
has a good reason for doing so. However, watch what you eat and ask your 
doctor for a complete list of foods to avoid, including those in the preceding 
list. MAO inhibitors include Nardil, Parnate, and Marplan.
Benzodiazepines
Better known as tranquilizers, the benzodiazepines were first introduced 
over 40 years ago. At first blush, these seemed like perfect medications for 
a host of anxiety problems. Unlike the antidepressants, they work rapidly, 
often reducing symptoms within 15 to 20 minutes. Not only that, they can be 
taken merely on an as-needed basis, when having to deal with an especially 
anxiety-arousing situation, such as confronting a phobia, giving a speech, or 
going to a job interview. The side effects tend to be less disturbing than those 
associated with antidepressants as well. And for 20 years or so after their 
introduction, they were seen as safer than barbiturates with a lower risk of 
overdose. They rapidly became the standard treatment for most of the anxi-
ety disorders. They appear to work by reinforcing a substance in the brain 
that blocks the excitability of nerve cells. What could be better?
 
Well, it turns out that the benzodiazepines do have some problems. Nothing’s 
perfect, after all. Dependency or addiction is a significant risk. As with many 
addictions, withdrawal from benzodiazepines can be difficult and even danger-
ous. Furthermore, if you stop taking them, your anxiety almost always returns. 
Rebound anxiety that’s more severe than that experienced before taking the 
drug is possible upon withdrawal.
Benzodiazepines are also associated with increasing the risk of falling among 
the elderly. And falls among the elderly too often result in hip fractures. In 
addition, a recent report suggested that benzodiazepines may double the risk 
of getting into a motor vehicle accident.
That risk rapidly escalates when benzodiazepines are taken in combination 
with alcohol. In fact, benzodiazepines are particularly problematic for those 
who have a history of substance abuse. Those who are addicted to recre-
ational drugs or alcohol readily become addicted to these medications and 
are at greater risk for combining alcohol with their medication.
Prescribing benzodiazepines to those who have suffered a recent trauma 
seems logical and humane. And indeed, these medications have the potential 
to improve sleep and reduce both arousal and anxiety. However, one study 
published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology found that the early 
and prolonged administration of benzodiazepines after a trauma actually 
appeared to increase the rate of full-blown post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) later. (See Chapter 2 for more information about PTSD.)

154
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
It also seems logical to assume that combining benzodiazepines with some 
of the various changes in behavior or thinking that can reduce anxiety (see 
Chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8) would make for a useful combination that could yield 
a better outcome than using either approach by itself. Yet studies conducted 
by psychologist Dr. Michael Otto at Massachusetts General Hospital have 
found that the risk of relapse is increased when these medications are com-
bined with changes in thinking and behaving. In the long run, it appears that 
for most people, learning coping strategies to deal with their anxiety seems 
better than merely seeking pharmacological solutions — especially with 
respect to the benzodiazepines.
Nevertheless, the benzodiazepines remain one of the most popular approaches 
to the treatment of anxiety disorders, especially among general practitioners 
who have no special training in psychiatry. In part, that may be due to the low 
side effect profile of the drugs. And these medications can sometimes play an 
important role, especially for short-term, acute stress and anxiety, as well as 
for those for whom other medications haven’t helped. We simply urge consid-
erable caution with the use of these agents. Following are some of the most 
commonly prescribed benzodiazepines listed by trade name, with generic 
names in parentheses:
 
✓ Ativan (lorazepam)
 
✓ Centrax (prazepam)
 
✓ Klonopin (clonazepam)
 
✓ Librium (chlordiazepoxide)
 
✓ Serax (oxazepam)
 
✓ Valium (diazepam)
 
✓ Xanax (alprazolam)
Miscellaneous tranquilizers
A few miscellaneous tranquilizers are chemically unrelated to the benzodiaz-
epines and thus appear to work rather differently.
 
You should know that in addition to the following list of miscellaneous tran-
quilizers, other types of tranquilizers are available. Furthermore, exciting new 
types of anti-anxiety drugs are under development, and some are undergoing 
clinical trials. Some of these are fast-acting, yet may have less of the undesir-
able side effect of addiction that has been found with the benzodiazepines.
For the time being, we list two anti-anxiety medications (with their generic 
names in parentheses) that your doctor might prescribe:

155
 Chapter 9: Considering Medications and Other Physical Treatment Options
 
✓ Buspar (buspirone): This medication belongs to a class of chemical 
compounds referred to as azaspirodecanediones (which are actually 
far less intimidating than their name). Exactly how buspar works is 
unknown. It has been studied the most for the treatment of general-
ized anxiety disorder (GAD), but may have value for treating various 
other anxiety-related problems, such as social phobia and PTSD, among 
others. It may not be as useful for panic attacks as other medications. 
Although extensive evidence is necessary to rule out addictive potential, 
the current belief is that Buspar’s likelihood for producing dependence 
is quite low.
 
✓ Vistaril, also marketed as Atarax and Rezine (hydroxyzine): This 
medication is an antihistamine as well as a tranquilizer. It’s used to treat 
various kinds of anxiety and tension-related problems as well as allergic 
reactions, such as hives and itching. Fast-acting, this drug takes effect 
within 30 minutes.
Beta blockers
Because anxiety can increase blood pressure, perhaps it’s not surprising 
that a few medications for the treatment of hypertension also reduce anxiety. 
Chief among these are the so-called beta blockers that block the effects of 
norepinephrine. Thus, they control many of the physical symptoms of anxi-
ety, such as shaking, trembling, rapid heartbeat, and blushing. In the treat-
ment of anxiety, their usefulness is primarily limited to specific phobias, such 
as social anxiety and performance anxiety. They’re highly popular among 
professional musicians, who often use them to reduce their performance 
anxiety prior to an important concert or audition. Two beta blockers, Inderal 
and Tenormin, are most frequently prescribed for these purposes:
 
✓ Inderal (propranolol): Generally, Inderal is used for the short-term alle-
viation of stage fright, public speaking, test anxiety, and social anxiety. 
It’s often given as a single dose prior to a performance.
 
✓ Tenormin (atenolol): This medication usually has fewer side effects 
than Inderal and is longer-acting. Tenormin is also often given as a single 
dose prior to a performance.
Atypical antipsychotics
Medications called atypical antipsychotic medications are not often prescribed 
for anxiety disorders. They’re atypical in the sense that, unlike earlier medi-
cations, they have a lower risk of certain serious side effects, and they can be 

156
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
used to treat a far broader range of problems than simply psychosis, a distur-
bance in the ability to perceive reality correctly. The atypical antipsychotics 
target a different neurotransmitter than the SSRIs and sometimes are used in 
combination with SSRIs. When used to treat anxiety-related problems, these 
medications are usually prescribed at far lower doses than when used for 
psychotic disorders.
Upon seeing this category, you may have easily thought, “Hey, I’m anxious; 
I’m not crazy!” And, in fact, psychosis is a serious mental disorder that often 
involves disordered thinking, hallucinations, delusions, and other serious 
distortions of reality. So you may wonder why medications designed to treat 
psychosis have anything to do with treating anxiety. Those who merely suffer 
from anxiety rarely, if ever, experience the kind of substantially confused 
thinking that psychotics do.
These medications are primarily prescribed for people who have severe, 
hard-to-treat anxiety or who suffer from other mental disorders along with 
anxiety. They’re generally not prescribed unless other forms of treatment 
have been unsuccessful. They have some especially distressing side effects. 
Possibly the most feared are known as extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), 
which can include a wide range of problems, such as
 
✓ Abnormal, uncontrollable, irregular muscle movements in the face, 
mouth, and, sometimes, other body parts
 
✓ An intense feeling of restlessness
 
✓ Muscle stiffness
 
✓ Prolonged spasms or muscle contractions
 
✓ Shuffling gait
These EPS effects appear to occur less often with the newer atypical antipsy-
chotic medications as opposed to the older, traditional antipsychotic medi-
cations. Because the risk of EPS is relatively low, those with severe anxiety 
disorders for whom changes in behavior or thinking (see Chapters 5, 6, 7, 
and 8) or other medications haven’t helped sufficiently may want to consider 
using these new anti-anxiety tools.
However, because the risk exists, those with relatively milder anxiety prob-
lems would probably want to avoid them.
 
Another disturbing side effect with many of these atypical antipsychotics is a 
change in metabolism that increases the risk of weight gain and can eventually 
lead to diabetes. As with most of the medications for anxiety, these should 
generally be avoided when pregnant or breast-feeding. Consult your physician 
for the best alternatives.

157
 Chapter 9: Considering Medications and Other Physical Treatment Options
Here are four antipsychotic medications, with their generic names in paren-
theses. Other medications are under development.
 
✓ Risperdal (risperidone)
 
✓ Abilify (aripiprazole)
 
✓ Zyprexa (olanzapine)
 
✓ Seroquel (quetiapine)
 
✓ Geodon (ziprasivone)
Mood stabilizers
Mood stabilizers are usually prescribed for other conditions. However, 
when standard treatments haven’t worked, doctors sometimes find them 
useful for treating their patients’ anxiety. People who suffer mood swings 
like those with bipolar disorder often benefit from this particular class of 
drugs. Medications in this category include Depakote (valporic acid), Eskalith 
(lithium), Lamictal (lamotrigine), Neurontin (gabapentin), Tegretol (carbam-
azepine), and Topamax (topiramate).
A few intriguing medication options
The search for anti-anxiety medication options leads to a few unexpected 
places. The following list describes a few of these.
 
✓ Catapres (clonidine) is a medication usually used to treat hypertension 
by relaxing the blood vessels. It seems to ease some symptoms of PTSD, 
especially in children. Serious side effects have been reported, however.
 
✓ D-cycloserine, an antibiotic used as a treatment for chronic tuberculo-
sis, appears to also help people extinguish their fears more quickly and 
completely when they’re doing exposure types of therapy (see Chapter 
8). Taking this drug while facing fears may allow people to speed up the 
process of unlearning the original fear, and the patient only needs to 
take the drug during a few therapy sessions.
 
✓ Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), also known as the street 
drug Ecstasy, has been found to facilitate exposure treatment for people 
with PTSD. The studies are promising but preliminary. Ecstasy appears 
to have a positive effect on mood and empathy.
 
 During therapy, it is administered under medical supervision — we don’t 
encourage our readers to try this at home.

158
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
 
✓ Oxytocin is another interesting treatment for social phobia that is 
administered just before the client begins a session of cognitive behav-
ioral therapy. Oxytocin, a naturally occurring hormone that is released 
by both men and women during orgasm, is given via nasal spray. 
Oxytocin won’t give you an orgasm administered this way, but research-
ers at the University of Zurich in Switzerland have found that people 
with social phobia who are given a few sniffs of oxytocin feel more confi-
dent and open to therapy.
Searching for Supplements
Dietary supplements include vitamins, amino acids, minerals, enzymes, 
metabolites, or botanicals that reputedly enhance your health and/or your 
body’s functions. Such supplements appear in many different forms — 
capsules, powders, tablets, teas, liquids, and granules. You can buy supple-
ments from the Internet, your local drugstore, a grocery store, or a health 
food store. Claimed benefits of supplements include improved immune sys-
tems, enhanced sleep, stronger bones, revved-up sexual response, cancer 
cures, and overcoming anxiety.
 
People seek supplements often because they assume that they’re safer than 
prescription drugs. That’s not necessarily true. Supplements are not consid-
ered drugs in the United States and therefore are not subjected to the same 
level of scrutiny as most medications. Before a prescription drug can come to 
market, the manufacturer must conduct clinical studies to establish the safety, 
effectiveness, dosage, and possible harmful interactions with other medica-
tions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t require clinical 
trials to establish the safety of herbs. Instead, after a supplement makes it to 
market, the only way it will be removed is if enough consumers suffer seri-
ous side effects and complain to the right agencies, which can trigger an FDA 
investigation and possible decision to withdraw the herb from store shelves.
Another serious problem with supplements is that untrained salespeople 
often make recommendations for their use. Fortunately, healthcare profes-
sionals who are also interested and trained in the safe and effective use of 
supplements can help. By contrast, salesclerks vary widely in the usefulness 
of their advice. Dolores’ story isn’t all that unusual.
A young, fit salesperson smiles at Dolores as she enters the health food 
store. Dolores tells him that she would like to find a natural remedy to 
help her calm down. She reports difficulty concentrating, poor sleep, and 
always feeling on edge. The young man nods and suggests a regimen of 
vitamins and supplements to build up her resistance to stress, improve 
her concentration, and ease her symptoms of anxiety.

159
 Chapter 9: Considering Medications and Other Physical Treatment Options
Pulling bottles off the shelves, he tells her, “Some B vitamins to build 
you up; C to fight infections. Here are some amino acids — L-lysine and 
tyrosine — and a compound, 5-HTP. Minerals: calcium, zinc, potassium, 
and magnesium. Kelp nourishes. Melatonin for sleep. Oh yes, maybe 
some SAM-e to improve your mood. Then the herbs: hops, passionflower, 
valerian, lemon balm, chamomile, and kava kava. Now, take these at least 
an hour before you eat. Eat carbohydrates with these, not protein. And 
this one needs to be taken just before bed.”
The bill comes to $214, and Dolores goes home feeling a bit overwhelmed. 
One day at work, after ingesting a dozen pills, she runs to the bathroom 
to throw up. A concerned friend asks her what’s making her sick. Dolores 
tells her about all the supplements that she’s taking. Her friend suggests 
that Dolores seek the advice of a naturopathic practitioner; she explains 
that these professionals attend a four-year, full-time training program and 
must pass a rigorous exam.
Dolores visits a naturopathic practitioner who advises her to dump the 
majority of her purchases in favor of a multiple vitamin and one herbal 
supplement. He also discusses several relaxation strategies, exercise 
routines, and self-help books. Within a few weeks, Dolores feels like a 
new person.
The example of Dolores may seem extreme. However, the supplement busi-
ness is a highly profitable one. Well-intentioned salesclerks rarely have medi-
cal training.
Dolores was actually lucky compared to Hector, whose story appears next. 
Hector not only tries herbal supplements, but mixes them with a prescription 
drug and alcohol, resulting in a very dangerous scenario.
It’s payday, and Hector’s buddies invite him to hoist a few beers. “Sure,” 
he says. “I can’t stay too long, but I could use a couple of beers; it’s been 
a tough week.” Munching on spicy bar mix, Hector finishes off two beers 
over the course of an hour and a half. He stumbles a bit as he gets off the 
bar stool, and the bartender asks if he’s okay. Hector reassures the bar-
tender that he’s sober. After all, he only had two beers.
Driving home, Hector drifts into the left lane for a moment but swerves 
back into line. Just then, he hears a car behind him honking. A few 
moments later, he sees police lights flashing. Puzzled, he pulls over. 
Hector fails a field sobriety test, but a breathalyzer test registers Hector’s 
blood alcohol level at .03, well below the legal limit. What’s going on?
Hector recently complained to his physician about feeling stressed at 
his job. His doctor prescribed a low dose of anti-anxiety medication and 
warned Hector not to take too much because it could be addictive if he 
wasn’t careful. Hector found the medication useful, and it calmed him a 

160
Part II: Battling Anxiety 
bit, but the medication didn’t quite do the trick. A friend recommended 
two herbs to try. Hector figured that would be a great, natural way to 
enhance the prescribed drug and that herbs certainly couldn’t hurt him. 
To add up Hector’s scorecard, he had combined two anxiety-alleviating 
herbs, a prescription drug, and alcohol — and was lucky that the police 
pulled him over. Hector could have ended up in a serious accident, harm-
ing himself or others.
 
Don’t forget that even moderate alcohol consumption, combined with anti-
anxiety agents, can intensify sedative effects to the point of substantial impair-
ment and even death. Be careful!
Hunting for helpful herbs
People have used herbal remedies for thou-
sands of years. Some of them work. In fact, a 
significant number of prescription medications 
are derived from herbs. You may want to try out 
an herb or two for your anxiety. We recommend 
that you read the literature about each herb 
carefully to make an informed choice before 
purchasing them from a reputable dealer. And 
always let your doctor know what herbs or 
supplements you’re taking.
 ✓ Saint John’s Wort: This plant has been 
used since ancient times for medicinal pur-
poses. Studies show that it’s as effective as 
some antidepressants for mild depression. 
Research on St. John’s Wort is insufficient 
to recommend this as a treatment for anxi-
ety. Be careful: It can intensify the effects 
of sun and lead to sunburn.
 ✓ Kava kava: The islanders in the South 
Pacific have consumed kava kava for both 
pleasure and healing. They have typically 
used it to treat a host of ailments, includ-
ing obesity, syphilis, and gonorrhea. The 
islanders have also used it for relaxation, 
insomnia, and anxiety reduction. Kava kava 
has been used extensively in Europe for 
anxiety, although usage varies from area 
to area. Studies suggest that it does have 
a positive effect on anxiety, although the 
effect is modest. However, a few countries 
have banned kava kava due to its reported, 
but apparently rare, potential for causing 
liver problems.
 ✓ Valerian: Valerian is an herb native to 
Europe and Asia. The word comes from the 
Latin term meaning well-being. Valerian 
has been suggested for digestive problems, 
insomnia, and anxiety. Like many herbs, it’s 
used extensively in Europe but is gaining in 
popularity in the United States.
Many other herbal remedies for anxiety are pro-
moted as safe, effective methods. But beware; 
most of these herbs haven’t been subjected to 
scrutiny for effectiveness or safety. We suggest 
that you avoid these because so many other 
anxiety-reducing agents and strategies work 
without dangerous side effects. On the other 
hand, we don’t think that you need to be overly 
alarmed about drinking a little herbal tea from 
time to time. Most of these brews contain rela-
tively small amounts of the active ingredients 
and likely pose little threat.

161
 Chapter 9: Considering Medications and Other Physical Treatment Options
Viva vitamins!
Chronic stress taxes the body. The results of several studies link mood dis-
orders to vitamin deficiencies, and especially severe deficiencies may make 
your anxiety worse. Therefore, some experts recommend a good multivita-
min supplement.
 
Can vitamins and minerals cure your anxiety? That’s not likely. However, they 
may help to keep your body in better shape for handling the stresses that 
come your way. Just take care not to take huge quantities. Even vitamins can 
produce toxic effects at megadoses.
Sifting through the slew of supplements
If you search the Internet and your local health food stores, you can probably 
find over a hundred supplements advertised as antidotes for anxiety. But do 
they work? Only a few that we know of. The following have at least garnered a 
smidge of evidence in support of their value as possible anxiety axes:
 
✓ Melatonin: Reaching a peak around midnight, this hormone helps to 
regulate sleep rhythms in the body. In particular, it addresses the prob-
lem of falling asleep at the right time (known as sleep onset) as opposed 
to the problem of awakening in the early morning and being unable to 
go back to sleep. Synthetic melatonin taken in the early evening, a few 
hours before bedtime, may alleviate this particular type of insomnia, a 
common problem among those who have excessive anxiety.
 
 Side effects such as dizziness, irritability, fatigue, headache, and low-
level depression are all possible, but the long-term side effects aren’t 
really known at this time. Avoid driving or drinking alcohol when you 
take melatonin.
 
 If you have an autoimmune disease or if you’re depressed, you should 
probably avoid melatonin.
 
✓ SAM-e: Claimed to relieve the pain and stiffness of osteoarthritis and 
fibromyalgia, this amino acid occurs naturally in the body. It may also 
help treat depression and anxiety. However, research on this supple-
ment remains limited. SAM-e appears to increase levels of serotonin and 
dopamine in the brain, which could theoretically alleviate anxiety.
 
 Possible side effects such as gastrointestinal upset, nervousness, insom-
nia, headache, and agitation may result, but again, little is known about 
the possible long-term effects.

 Don’t take SAM-e if you have bipolar disorder or severe depression. 
SAM-e may contribute to mania, which is a dangerous, euphoric state 
that often includes poor judgment and risky behaviors.
 
✓ 5-HTP: This popular supplement is a compound that increases the levels 
of serotonin in the brain. Serotonin plays a critical role in regulating 
mood and anxiety. Some evidence also exists that 5-HTP may increase 
the brain’s natural pain relievers, endorphins. Unfortunately, only limited 
research has been conducted on this supplement. These studies suggest 
that 5-HTP may reduce anxiety somewhat.
 
 Don’t take 5-HTP if you’re also taking another antidepressant. Also avoid 
it if you have tumors or cardiovascular disease.
 
✓ Omega-3 fatty acids: Found in flax seed, avocados, soybeans, and fish, 
these acids have been shown to improve mood for those with depres-
sion. Evidence of their usefulness for anxiety is less robust, but there is 
sufficient evidence that having enough omega 3 fatty acids in the body 
improves cardiovascular health. So, consider taking these supplements 
(make sure that they’re purified to eliminate toxins like mercury).
A number of alternative medicine practitioners also frequently recommend 
the supplement gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). This supplement may 
have a mild tranquilizing effect, but little data is available to substantiate 
that claim.
Stimulating the Brain
People with severe cases of anxiety often try many different treatments. 
Unfortunately, a few cases neither resolve nor even improve with standard 
treatments such as psychotherapy or medication. For those people, new 
advances in science and technology may offer hope for improvement or even 
a cure to their suffering. However, you should be aware that the effectiveness 
of these new approaches has not yet been firmly established. They really 
should be considered as a last resort at this time.
Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)
The vagus nerve sends information from the digestive system, the heart, and 
the lungs throughout the brain. Anxiety is usually experienced throughout 
these systems, with symptoms ranging from stomach upset to rapid breath-
ing to feelings of fear to thinking that something bad might happen. VNS was 
developed as a treatment for people with epilepsy. A device is implanted in 
the chest that sends electric pulses to the vagus nerve.

163
 Chapter 9: Considering Medications and Other Physical Treatment Options
Later, this treatment was found to help those with severe depression. Many 
of those who experienced relief from either epileptic seizures or depres-
sion also noted decreases in anxiety. Therefore, a few studies have been 
conducted using VNS with treatment-resistant cases of anxiety. Results are 
hopeful, but considerably more research is needed. For now, VNS remains an 
alternative only for those who have had multiple treatment failures for severe 
anxiety.
 
Although serious side effects are rare, VNS can cause pain at the site of the 
incision, voice hoarseness, sore throat, and facial muscle weakness.
Deep brain stimulation (DBS)
In this procedure, an electrical stimulator is surgically implanted in the chest 
with leads going deep into the brain. This treatment was first used to help 
those with Parkinson’s disease, a progressive neurological disorder that 
effects movement. People with Parkinson’s noticed an improvement in their 
moods when DBS was started.
Now, the FDA has approved DBS to be used with very severe, treatment-
resistant OCD (see Chapter 2). This innovative treatment appears to have 
helped some with severe, chronic OCD.
 
The side effects of DBS can include bleeding of the brain, movement problems, 
and delirium. At this time, the treatment should only be considered in extreme 
cases.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
TMS involves inducing a magnetic field on the scalp by sending an electrical 
current into a coil. This treatment does not require surgical implantation, so 
side effects are less dangerous than those treatments that involve surgery. 
However, research on the successful use of this technique for those with 
anxiety disorders is quite sparse.
TMS has mainly been used to treat depression. Studies on TMS have been 
somewhat inconsistent. Because studies have varied in the strength of the 
magnetic field, the placement of the coil, and the duration of the treatment, it 
is hard to compare and contrast the results. Many more studies are needed 
to recommend TMS for helping people with anxiety.

Y
ou see how to deal with anxiety more indirectly with 
a calm, passive approach. We show you how connec-
tions with other people, relaxation exercises, breathing 
techniques, good sleep habits, and proper nutrition all 
help quell anxious feelings.
You also discover why taking a mindful approach to anxi-
ety is emerging as an exciting, empirically validated way 
to overcome anxiety. Mindfulness helps you accept the 
inevitable uncertainty and risk in life with calm 
detachment.

▶ Creating a calming diet
D
o you lead a busy life with too much to do and too little time? Do you 
grab dinner from the nearest drive-through for you and the kids on the 
way home from soccer practice? Do you lie awake at night thinking about 
everything you have to do? Your frantic lifestyle probably leads to poor 
sleep, not enough exercise, and poor diet. You know you should be taking 
better care of yourself, which makes you feel stressed and anxious, com-
pounding the problem.
In this chapter, we describe three sound strategies for calming down your 
life: staying connected with others, delegating, and saying “no.” We also help 
you find the motivation for bringing exercise into your life. We show you 
how to get the best rest possible and what to do in the hours before bed that 
can help your sleep. Finally, we take a look at some tips for improving eating 
habits to quell anxious feelings.
Friends and Family — Can’t Live 
with ’em, Can’t Live without ’em
Some days, the people in your life provide all the love and support you could 
ever want. They offer to do things for you, listen to your woes, and com-
fort you when things go wrong. Other days, those same people make you 
wish you could move to a deserted island for a couple of weeks. They make 

168
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
unreasonable demands and lean on you excessively — complaining about 
problems of their own making, leaving you feeling stressed and worn out. The 
following three sections discuss the pros and cons of people in your life and 
offer suggestions on how to get the most out of your relationships.
Staying connected to others
In spite of the potential of family and friends to cause stress and aggravation, 
numerous studies have demonstrated that good, close relationships greatly 
enhance people’s sense of well-being. Staying connected with people pays off 
in terms of substantially improved mental and physical health. Connections 
even appear to provide some protection against mental declines that often 
accompany old age.
 
So we highly recommend that you focus on friendship, community, and family 
bonds. Here are a few ideas for doing so:
 
✓ Make sure you make face-to-face contact with your friends — don’t just 
e-mail and text them.
 
✓ Have family meals together whenever possible — it doesn’t have to be 
any fancier than ordering pizza.
 
✓ Volunteer at a nearby Humane Society, hospital, or school.
 
✓ Call a friend you haven’t talked with in a while.
 
✓ Take walks in your neighborhood and introduce yourself to people you 
encounter.
 
✓ Offer to help your family members with a garage sale or some other 
project.
You get the idea. Staying connected doesn’t have to take lots of time or cost 
money, but it does take effort. That effort pays off not only for you but also 
for your friends, family, and community.
 
People with social anxiety may find these activities difficult. If that’s the case 
for you, work on your social anxiety first as described in Chapters 5 through 9.
 
One connection involves you and at least one other person. So when you 
reach out to someone else, you may be doing them just as much good as 
you’re doing yourself.
What’s that? You say you don’t have time to connect with friends and family 
members? We’ve got solutions for that problem in the next two sections.

169
 Chapter 10: Looking at Lifestyle
Delegating for extra time
Many people with anxiety feel they must always take responsibility for their 
job, the care of their family, and their home. Unless they have a hand in 
everything, they worry that things may not get done. And if someone else 
takes over a task, they fear that the result will fall short of their standards.
However, if life has become overwhelming and too stressed, learning to del-
egate may be your only choice. Pushing yourself too hard can put you at risk 
for illness, bad moods, and increased anxiety. And delegating a few things 
usually works out much better than you think it will.
 
Here are a few possibilities for your delegating list:
 
✓ Take the risk of letting your partner do some laundry and cooking.
 
✓ Hire a cleaning service to come in once a month (more often if you can 
afford it).
 
✓ Spend a Sunday afternoon preparing large quantities of a few meals that 
can be frozen and consumed over the next week and much later.
 
✓ Enlist the family to spend one hour a week in a frantic, joint cleaning effort.
 
✓ Hire a monthly lawn service.
 
✓ Use online banking and bill paying — it saves more time than you think!
 
✓ Read Organizing For Dummies by Eileen Roth and Elizabeth Miles (Wiley).
We realize a few of these ideas cost money. Not always as much as you may 
think, but still, they do cost something. Partly, it’s a matter of how high 
money stacks up on your priority list. Balance money against time for the 
things that you value.
Nevertheless, not all families can consider such options. You may notice that 
not all these options entail financial burden. Get creative. Ask your friends, 
co-workers, and family for ideas on how to delegate. It could change your life.
 
Come up with two tasks that you could delegate to someone else. They don’t 
need to cost money — just relieve one or more of your burdens in a way that 
saves you time.
Just saying “no”
We have one more idea. Say “no.” If you’re anxious, you may have trouble 
standing up for your rights. Anxiety often prevents people from express-
ing their feelings and needs. When that happens, resentment joins anxiety 
and leads to frustration and anger. Furthermore, if you can’t say “no,” other 

170
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
people can purposefully or inadvertently take advantage of you. You no 
longer own your time and your life.
First, notice the situations in which you find yourself agreeing when you 
don’t really want to. Does it happen mostly at work, with family, with friends, 
or with strangers? When people ask you to do something, try the following:
 
✓ Validate the person’s request or desire. For example, if someone asks 
you if you’d mind dropping off something at the post office on your way 
home from work, say, “I understand that it would be more convenient 
for you if I dropped that off.” This will give you more time to consider 
whether you really want to do it.
 
✓ After you make up your mind to say “no,” look the person who’s 
making the request in the eye. You don’t need to rush your response.
 
✓ Give a brief explanation, especially if it’s a friend or family member. 
However, remember that you really don’t owe anyone an explanation 
for turning down their request; it’s merely polite. You can say that you’d 
like to help out, but it just isn’t possible, or you can simply state that 
you really would rather not.
 
✓ Be clear that you can’t or won’t do what you’ve been asked. It’s a fun-
damental human right to say “no.”
 
When you say “no” to bosses or family members, they may be temporarily 
unhappy with you. If you find yourself overreacting to their displeasure, it may 
be due to an agitating assumption or anxious schema. See Chapter 7 for more 
information.
Ready . . . Exorcise!
Please excuse our pun: We’re not advising that you attempt to exorcise 
demons or perform hocus-pocus, but like a good housecleaning, exercise can 
clear out the cobwebs and cast out the cloudy thinking and inertia that may 
accompany anxiety.
Exercise reduces anxiety. The harder and longer that you go at it — whether 
you’re swimming, jogging, walking, working in the yard or on your home, 
playing racquetball or tennis, or even walking up the stairs — the less anx-
ious you’ll be. Exercise instills a newfound sense of confidence while blowing 
away anxiety’s cloud. With enough exercise, you’ll feel your attitude changing 
from negative to positive.
 
Some people with anxiety get a little driven and compulsive. Don’t take our 
advice on exercise and go overboard! Yes, the more, the better, but only to a 
point. If your exercise starts taking time from other important activities, you 
may be overdoing it.

171
 Chapter 10: Looking at Lifestyle
Exercise reduces anxiety in several ways:
 
✓ It helps to rid your body of the excess adrenaline that increases anxiety 
and arousal.
 
✓ It increases your body’s production of endorphins — substances that 
reduce pain and create a mild, natural sense of well-being.
 
✓ It helps to release muscle tension and frustrations.
Of course, everyone has felt that they should exercise more. Most people 
realize that exercise has some sort of health benefits, but not everyone 
knows how extensive these benefits can be. Researchers have found that 
exercise decreases anxiety, bad cholesterol, blood pressure, depression, 
and chronic pain. It also decreases risks of various diseases, such as heart 
disease and some cancers. Finally, exercise improves your immune system, 
balance, flexibility, mental sharpness, and sense of well-being.
Wow! With such extensive positive effects on anxiety, health, and well-being, 
why isn’t everyone exercising? Millions of people do. Unfortunately, millions 
do not. The reasons are both simple and complex. For the most part, people 
hit a brick wall when it comes to finding the motivation to exercise and 
especially to sustain it. They complain about not having the time and being 
too embarrassed, too old, too fat, and too tired to exercise. But if our list of 
benefits appeals to you, the next section, “Don’t wait for willpower — Just do 
it!” may help you muster the motivation. And then, because we know what 
you’re going to think next — “I don’t have time to exercise!” — we provide a 
list of excuse-busting ways to fit your workout into your schedule.
 
Before beginning an exercise program, you should check with your doctor. 
This is especially true if you’re over 40, overweight, or have any known health 
problems. Your doctor can tell you about any cautions, limitations, or restric-
tions that you should consider. Also, if, after brief exercise, you experience 
chest pain, extreme shortness of breath, nausea, or dizziness, consult your 
physician immediately.
Don’t wait for willpower — Just do it!
Have you ever thought that you just don’t have the willpower to undertake an 
exercise program? You may be surprised to discover that we don’t believe in 
willpower. That’s right. Willpower is merely a word, an idea; it’s not real.
Your brain doesn’t have a special structure that contains so-called willpower. 
It’s not something that you have a set quantity of and that you can’t do 
anything about. The reason people believe that they don’t have willpower 
is merely because they don’t do what they think they should. But reasons 
other than willpower account for the lack of effort: namely, distorted thinking 

172
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
and a failure to include sufficient rewards. Therefore, dealing with distorted 
thoughts and designing rewards works better than waiting for willpower.
Distorted thinking
Your mind may tell you things like, “I just don’t have the time,” “I’m too 
tired,” “It isn’t worth the effort,” or, “I’ll look stupid compared to the other 
people who are in better shape than me.”
If you’re waiting for motivation to come knocking at your door, you could be 
in for a long wait. Not many people wake up with a burst of new enthusiasm 
for starting an exercise program. Like the Nike commercials say, “Just do it.” 
That’s because motivation frequently follows action; if you think otherwise, 
you’re putting the cart before the horse.
Lack of reward
Another problem that accounts for lack of motivation comes about when you 
fail to set up a plan for rewarding new efforts. You may believe that exercise 
will cost you something in terms of leisure time, rest, or more profitable 
work. In some ways, this is true. That’s why you need to set up a plan for 
reinforcing your efforts.
Psychologists have known for decades that people usually do more of what 
they find rewarding and less of what they find unpleasant whenever they 
can. That fact may sound like a no-brainer to you. Nevertheless, ignoring the 
importance of rewards is easy when trying to get started on an exercise 
program.
 
Set up your own personal reward system for exercising. For example, give 
yourself ten points for each time that you exercise for 30 minutes or more. 
After you accumulate 100 points, indulge yourself with a treat — buying a new 
outfit, going out for dinner at a nice restaurant, planning a special weekend, or 
setting aside a whole day to spend on your favorite hobby. Over time, as exer-
cise becomes a little more pleasant (which it will!), up the ante — require 200 
points before you treat yourself.
Eventually, you’ll find that exercise becomes rewarding in its own right, and 
you won’t need to reward yourself as a means of instilling the necessary moti-
vation. As the pain of an out-of-shape body lessens and endurance increases, 
you’ll discover other rewards from exercise as well:
 
✓ It can be a great time to think about solutions to problems.
 
✓ You can plan out the day or week while you exercise.
 
✓ Some people report increased creative thoughts during exercise.
 
✓ You may get a great feeling from the sense of accomplishment.

173
 Chapter 10: Looking at Lifestyle
 
Because exercise often doesn’t feel good in the beginning, setting up a self-
reward system sometimes helps a great deal; later, other rewards will likely 
kick in.
Working in your workout
Today, people work longer hours than ever before, so it’s tempting to think 
that the day doesn’t hold enough time for exercise. However, it’s all a matter 
of priorities; you won’t find the time unless you plan for it.
That’s right; you have to scrutinize your schedule seriously and work exer-
cise into your life. Perhaps your job offers flex time, whereby you can choose 
to come in an hour later and stay later two or three times a week to have time 
to exercise in the morning, or perhaps you can exercise twice on the week-
ends and find just one time after work during the week. And it isn’t all that 
difficult to add a little to your regular exercise periods. For example:
 
✓ Park at a distance: Park your car about a 20-minute brisk walk away 
from your place of work once or twice a week.
 
✓ Take the stairs: If you often take the elevator up five or six floors to 
work, try a brisk walk up the stairs several times a day instead.
 
✓ Exercise during your breaks: If you get a couple of 10- or 15-minute 
breaks at work, try going for a brisk walk rather than standing around 
the water cooler. Two or three 10-minute periods of exercise do you the 
same amount of good as that one 20- or 30-minute period does.
How about exercise and panic?
Some people fear that exercise could set off 
panic attacks. In part, that’s because exer-
cise produces a few bodily symptoms, such 
as increased heart rate, that are similar to the 
symptoms of panic attacks, and those with a 
panic disorder sometimes respond to such 
symptoms with panic. However, if you go at 
exercise gradually, it can serve as a graded 
exposure task, as we discuss in Chapter 8. In 
other words, it can be an effective treatment 
approach for panic.
Although the actual risk is somewhat contro-
versial, exercise can cause a buildup of lactic 
acid, which does seem to trigger panic attacks 
in a few people. However, over the long run, 
exercise also improves your body’s ability to rid 
itself of lactic acid. Therefore, again, we rec-
ommend that if you fear having panic attacks 
as a result of exercise, simply go slowly. If you 
find it absolutely intolerable, stop exercising for 
a while or use other strategies in this book for 
reducing your panic attack frequency before 
going back to exercise.

174
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
The ABCs of Getting Your Zs
People generally need about eight hours of sleep per night. Seniors may need a 
little less sleep, but this idea remains controversial among scientists. Besides, 
the real gauge as to whether you’re getting enough sleep is how you feel during 
the daytime, not the exact number of hours you get. In any case, anxiety fre-
quently disrupts sleep, and a lack of sleep can increase your anxiety.
Many people have trouble falling asleep at night. As if falling asleep isn’t hard 
enough, many people wake up before they want to, driven into high alert as 
anxious thoughts race through their consciousness.
 
The tendency toward an early-morning awakening with an inability to get 
back to sleep can be a sign of depression as well as anxiety. If your appetite 
changes, your energy decreases, your mood swings into low gear, your ability 
to concentrate diminishes, and you’ve lost interest in activities that you once 
found pleasurable, you may be clinically depressed. You should check with a 
mental-health practitioner or a physician to find out.
More goes into sleeping than just lying down and shutting your eyes. Factors 
that affect your sleep include the activities you do before you go to bed, your 
sleeping environment, and knowing what to do when sleep is elusive. We 
address these topics in the following sections.
Creating a sleep haven
Your sleep environment matters. Of course, some rare birds can sleep almost 
anywhere — on the couch, in a chair, on the floor, in the car, or even at their 
desk at work. On the other hand, most folks require the comfort of a bed and 
the right conditions. Sleep experts report that for a restful sleep, you should 
sleep in a room that’s
 
✓ Dark: You have a clock in your brain that tells you when it’s time to 
sleep. Darkness helps set the clock by causing the brain to release mela-
tonin, a hormone that helps to induce sleep. Consider putting up cur-
tains that block out most of the sun if you find yourself awakened by the 
early morning light or you need to sleep during the day. Some people 
even wear masks to keep light out.
 
✓ Cool: People sleep better in a cool room. If you feel cold, adding blan-
kets is usually preferable to turning up the thermostat.
 
✓ Quiet: If you live near a busy street or have loud neighbors, consider 
getting a fan or white noise generator to block out nuisance noises. The 

175
 Chapter 10: Looking at Lifestyle
worst kind of noise is intermittent and unpredictable. If the noise is dis-
turbing, the various kinds of sporadic noise that can be blocked out by a 
simple floor fan may amaze you.
 
✓ Complete with a comfortable bed: Mattresses matter. If you sleep with 
someone else or a dog, make sure that everyone has enough room.
In other words, make your bedroom a retreat that looks inviting and cozy. 
Spoil yourself with high-thread-count sheets and pillowcases. You may want to 
try aromatherapy (see Chapter 12). No one knows for sure whether it works, 
but many people claim that the fragrance of lavender helps them sleep.
Following a few relaxing routines
Sleep revitalizes your physical and mental resources. Studies show that sleep 
deprivation causes people to drive as if they were under the influence of 
drugs or alcohol. Physicians without sufficient sleep make more errors. Sleep 
deprivation makes you irritable, crabby, anxious, and despondent.
 
Thus, you need to schedule a reasonable amount of time for sleep — at least 
seven or eight hours. Don’t burn the candle at both ends. We don’t care how 
much work you have on your plate; depriving yourself of sleep only makes you 
less productive and less pleasant to be around.
So first and foremost, allow sufficient time for sleep. But that’s not enough if 
you have trouble with sleep, so we suggest that you look at the ideas in the 
subsections that follow to improve the quality of your sleep.
 
Whenever possible, go to bed at close to the same time every night. Many 
people like to stay up late on weekends, and that’s fine if you’re not having 
sleep problems, but if you are, we recommend sticking to the same schedule 
you follow on weeknights. You need a regular routine to prepare your mind 
for bed.
Associating sleep with your bed
One of the most important principles of sleep is to teach your brain to associ-
ate sleep with your bed. That means that when you get into bed, don’t bring 
work along with you. Some people find that reading before bed relaxes them, 
and others like to watch a little TV before bed. That’s fine if these activities 
work for you, but avoid doing them in bed.
If you go to bed and lie there for more than 20 or 30 minutes unable to fall 
asleep, get up. Again, the point is to train your brain to link your bed to sleep. 
You can train your brain to dislike getting up by taking on some unpleasant 

176
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
(though fairly passive, even boring) chore while you’re awake. If you do this 
a number of times, your brain will find it easier to start feeling drowsy when 
you’re in bed.
Winding down before hitting the hay
 
Some people find that taking a warm bath with fragrant oils or bath salts about 
an hour before hitting the hay is soothing. You may discover that soaking in a 
scented bath in a dimly lit bathroom while listening to relaxing music before 
going to bed is just the right ticket to solid slumber. Other people find the 
relaxation techniques we discuss in Chapters 11 and 12 quite helpful. Studies 
show that relaxation can improve sleep.
 
You need to wind down with passive activities before you turn in for the 
night. Therefore, don’t do heavy exercise within a few hours of going to sleep. 
Almost any stimulating activity can interfere with sleep, even mental exertion. 
For example, we discovered, somewhat to our dismay, that if we work on writ-
ing an article or a book after 9 p.m., our brains continue to spin out thoughts 
and ideas well after bedtime. So we’ve changed our routine, and we don’t 
write late in the evening.
Watching what you eat and drink
Obviously, you don’t want to load up on caffeinated drinks within a couple 
of hours before going to bed. Don’t forget that many sources other than 
coffee — colas, certain teas, chocolate, and certain pain relievers — contain 
caffeine. Of course, some people seem rather impervious to the effects of caf-
feine while others are better off not consuming any after lunch. Even if you 
haven’t been bothered by caffeine in the past, you can develop sensitivity 
to it as you age. Consider caffeine’s effects on you if you’re having trouble 
sleeping.
Nicotine also revs up the body. Try to avoid smoking just prior to bed. 
Obviously, it’s preferable to quit smoking entirely, but if you haven’t been 
able to stop yet, at least watch how much you smoke before bedtime.
 
Alcohol relaxes the body and should be a great way of aiding sleep, but it isn’t. 
That’s because alcohol disrupts your sleep cycles. You don’t get as much of 
the important REM sleep, and you may find yourself waking up early in the 
morning. However, some people find that drinking a glass or two of wine in the 
evening is relaxing. That’s fine, but watch the amount.
Heavy meals prior to bed aren’t such a great idea either; many people find 
that eating too much before bed causes mild discomfort. In addition, you may 
want to avoid highly spiced and/or fatty foods prior to bed. However, going 
to bed hungry is also a bad idea; the key is balance.

177
 Chapter 10: Looking at Lifestyle
 
So what should you eat or drink before bed? Herbal teas, such as chamomile 
or valerian, have many advocates. We don’t have much data on how well they 
work, but herbal teas are unlikely to interfere with sleep, and they’re pleasant 
to drink. Some evidence supports eating a small carbohydrate snack before 
bedtime to help induce sleep.
Mellowing medication
Many people try treating their sleep problems with over-the-counter medica-
tions, many of which contain antihistamines that do help, but they can lead 
to drowsiness the next day. Occasional use of these medications is relatively 
safe for most. Herbal formulas, such as melatonin or valerian, may also help.
If your sleep problems are chronic, you should consult your doctor. A medi-
cation that you’re already taking could possibly be interfering with your 
sleep. Your doctor may prescribe medication to help induce sleep. Many 
sleep medications become less effective over time, and some carry the risk of 
addiction. These potentially addictive medications are only used for a short 
period of time. On the other hand, a few sleep medications work as sleep aids 
for a longer time without leading to addiction. Talk about your sleep problem 
with your doctor for more information and help.
What to do when sleep just won’t come
If you’ve been practicing the suggestions in the previous sections and still 
haven’t resolved your sleep problems, we have a few more suggestions. 
Becky’s story illustrates some of the problematic thoughts people have that 
keep them awake. Then we tell you what to do about them.
As the clock chimes the hour, Becky sighs, realizing that it’s 2 a.m. and 
she has yet to fall asleep. She turns over and tries to be still so that she 
doesn’t wake her husband. She thinks, “With everything I have to do 
tomorrow, if I don’t sleep, I’ll be a wreck. I hate not sleeping.” She gets 
out of bed, goes into the bathroom, finds the bottle of melatonin, and 
pops three into her mouth. She’s been taking them routinely for months, 
and they just don’t seem to have the same effect that they did before.
She goes back to bed, tries to settle down, and worries about the bags 
under her eyes and what people will think. Her itchy, dry skin starts to 
crawl. She can’t stand the feeling of lying in bed for an eternity without 
sleeping.
In Becky’s mind, her lack of sleep turns into a catastrophe, and her pondering 
actually makes it far more difficult for her to fall asleep.

178
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
 
When you can’t sleep, try to make the problem seem less catastrophic by
 
✓ Reminding yourself that every single time that you failed to sleep in 
the past, somehow you got through the next day in spite of your lack 
of sleep the night before. It may not have been wonderful, but you 
did it.
 
✓ Realizing that occasional sleep loss happens to everyone. Excessive 
worry can only aggravate the problem.
 
✓ Getting up and distracting yourself with something else to do. This 
stops your mind from magnifying the problem and can also prevent you 
from associating your bed with not sleeping.
 
✓ Concentrating solely on your breathing. See Chapters 11 and 13 for 
ideas on breathing, mindfulness, and staying in the present moment 
as opposed to focusing on thoughts about the negative effects of your 
sleeplessness.
 
Many people try taking daytime naps when they consistently fail to sleep at 
night. It sounds like a great solution, but unfortunately, it only compounds the 
problem. Frequent or prolonged naps disrupt your body’s natural clock. If you 
must nap, make it a short power nap — no longer than 20 minutes.
Of course, a few unusual folks find that they can nap for just three or four 
minutes whenever they want during the day; they wake up refreshed and 
sleep well at night. If that’s you, go ahead and nap. Most people simply can’t 
do that.
Designing Calm Diets
Uncomfortable emotions cause some people to eat too much, others to seek 
so-called comfort food (full of fat and sugar), and still others to lose their 
appetites. Unfortunately, emotional eating only works for the very short 
run — perhaps a few minutes to an hour or so. In the long run, bad dieting 
habits increase distress either from weight gain or the negative impact on 
your body due to spikes in blood sugar levels or irregularity. So we recom-
mend that you follow a few simple, well-known principles of good eating to 
stabilize both your body and mind.
Enjoying small, frequent portions
Portion sizes have expanded almost as dramatically as people’s waistlines 
over the past century. Your great grandmother’s china appears doll-sized by 

179
 Chapter 10: Looking at Lifestyle
today’s standards. In fact, some antique dealers report having trouble con-
vincing customers that grandma’s dinner plates really are dinner plates and 
not for bread or salad.
By and large, most people simply eat too much at one time today. Here are a 
few ways to control portions:
 
✓ Use smaller plates: This creates an optical illusion, and you think you’re 
eating more food than you really are.
 
✓ Eat slowly: This gives your stomach time to tell your brain that you’re 
full and should stop eating.
 
✓ Fill your plate once, and put away the leftovers before you start 
eating: This removes the temptation to go back for seconds.
 
✓ When you’re at a restaurant, split a meal with a friend or box up half 
of it before you start eating: Restaurant portions are typically twice the 
size they should be for one meal. Eating only half of the meal provides 
the right amount of calories.
In other words, plan out what you want to eat and slow down your eating. 
Prepare several small, healthy snacks for dealing with cravings during the day.
Following nutritional common sense
For many people, the feeling of anxiety is similar to hunger. When stressed, a 
bowl of ice cream or some French fries with lots of ketchup sounds yummy, 
and those foods can momentarily boost moods. That’s because they contain 
loads of simple carbohydrates. The body turns those carbs into sugar and 
burns it up like rocket fuel — really fast. That fast burn then leads to a rapid 
drop in blood sugar levels often leading to a plunging mood, irritability, and a 
return of sugar cravings.
Replacing those simple carbohydrates with food containing complex carbs 
and fiber maintains more stable blood sugar levels and a more stable mood. 
Complex carbs are found in unprocessed foods, fruits, vegetables, whole 
grains, and legumes.

Relaxation: The Five-Minute 
Solution
In This Chapter
▶ Breathing your tension away
▶ Practicing progressive muscle relaxation
▶ Using relaxation techniques to thwart anxiety
▶ Calling your senses into play
“I 
don’t have time to relax. My life is far too hectic. I barely see my 
friends as it is now. I can’t remember the last time I took a whole 
weekend off. I even neglect my own family. By the time the dinner dishes are 
put away, I can’t think about anything else — I just collapse in front of the 
television or waste hours in front of my computer screen.”
Does this sound like you or someone you care about? When contemplating 
making changes in their lives, people complain about having too little time 
more than anything else — including no time for relaxation.
We asked a wise yogi master how long he practices every day, fully expect-
ing to hear the discouraging answer, “An hour or two.” Imagine our surprise 
when he told us, “Five minutes.” That’s all he needs. He went on to explain 
that he usually takes more time, but he only commits to five minutes out of 
each day.
We listened to our teacher, and we now ask a mere five minutes of ourselves 
daily. Five minutes of relaxation a day has changed our lives. Everyone can 
find five minutes. And if you relax for five minutes, it may stretch into 10 or 
20. But if it doesn’t, that’s okay. Relaxation will slowly infiltrate your life with-
out you even knowing it, and when anxiety hits, you’ll have a valuable tool for 
calming the storm within.
The relaxation procedures we give you in this chapter fall into three major 
categories: breathing techniques, ways to relax the body, and a few sensory 
experiences. Some of these can take a little longer at first to gain full mastery 

182
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
over, but they can all be done in five minutes when you get the hang of them. 
The key is daily practice. Like every other skill, the more you do it, the easier 
and faster it gets.
Blowing Anxiety Away
You’ve practiced breathing more than anything else in your life. In waking 
moments, you don’t even think about breathing. Yet, of all biological functions, 
breathing is critical to life. You can go days or weeks without food and a couple 
of days without water but only minutes without breathing. You need oxygen to 
purify the bloodstream, burn up waste products, and rejuvenate the body and 
mind. If you don’t get enough oxygen, your thinking becomes sluggish, your 
blood pressure rises, and your heart rate increases. You also get dizzy, shaky, 
and depressed, and eventually you lose consciousness and die.
 
Many people react to stress with rapid, shallow breathing that throws off the 
desired ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide in the blood. This phenomenon is 
called hyperventilation, and it causes a variety of distressing symptoms:
 
✓ Blurred vision
 
✓ Disorientation
 
✓ Jitteriness
 
✓ Loss of consciousness
 
✓ Muscle cramps
 
✓ Rapid pulse
 
✓ Tingling sensations in the extremities or face
Anxiety and relaxation make 
for strange bedfellows
Have you ever known two people who couldn’t 
be in the same room at the same time? If they 
show up at the same party, trouble is bound to 
brew. They’re like oil and water — they just 
don’t mix.
Anxiety and relaxation are a little like that. 
Think about it. How can you be anxious at the 
same time that you’re relaxed? Not an easy 
accomplishment. Psychologists have a term for 
this phenomenon: reciprocal inhibition. Many 
psychologists believe that the techniques 
described in this chapter work because relax-
ation inhibits anxiety, and vice versa. Training 
yourself diligently in the use of relaxation skills 
should help you inhibit your anxiety.

183
 Chapter 11: Relaxation: The Five-Minute Solution
Hyperventilation frequently accompanies panic attacks as well as chronic 
anxiety. The symptoms of over-breathing feel like symptoms of anxiety, and 
people with anxiety disorders may hyperventilate. Therefore, finding out how 
to breathe properly is considered an effective tool for managing anxiety.
Discovering your natural breathing pattern
When you came into the world, unless you had a physical problem with your 
lungs, you probably breathed just fine. Look at most babies. Unless they’re 
in distress from hunger or pain, they need no instruction in how to breathe 
or relax. Their little tummies rise and fall with each breath in a rhythmic, 
natural way. The stresses of everyday life, however, have since meddled with 
your inborn, natural breathing response.
Under stress, people usually breathe shallow and fast, or, sometimes, they don’t 
breathe at all. Some people hold their breath when they feel stressed and aren’t 
even aware that they’re doing it. Try noticing your breathing when you feel 
stressed, and see whether you’re a breath-holder or a rapid, shallow breather.
 
You can also check out how you breathe when you’re not stressed:
 
1. Lie down on your back.
 
2. Put one hand on your stomach and the other on your chest.
 
3. Notice the movements of your hands as you breathe.
 
 If you’re breathing correctly, the hand on your stomach rises as you 
inhale and lowers as you exhale. The hand on your chest doesn’t move 
so much, and to the extent that it does, it should do so in tandem with 
the other hand.
The odds are that if you have a problem with anxiety, your breathing could 
use a tuneup. That’s especially so if you have trouble with panic attacks. 
Breathing practice can start you on the way to feeling calmer.
Breathing like a baby
 
Abdominal breathing involves breathing with your diaphragm — the muscle 
that lies between your abdominal cavity and your lung cavity. Try this exer-
cise to start breathing slowly and deeply, like a baby again. You may want to 
lie down, or you can do this while sitting as long as you have a large, comfort-
able chair that you can stretch out in. Follow these steps:
 
1. Check out your body for tension. Notice whether certain muscles 
feel tight, your breathing is shallow and rapid, you’re clenching your 
teeth, or you have other distressing feelings.

184
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
 
 Rate your tension on a 1-to-10-point scale, with 1 representing complete 
relaxation and 10 meaning total tension.
 
2. Place a hand on your stomach.
 
3. Breathe in slowly through your nose, to a slow count of four, and fill 
the lower part of your lungs.
 
 You’re doing this correctly if your hand rises from your abdomen.
 
4. Pause and hold your breath for a moment.
 
5. Exhale slowly, to a slow count of six.
 
 Imagine your entire body is deflating like a balloon, and let it go limp.
 
 If you find this hard to do at first, exhale to a count of four. Later, you’ll 
find that slowing down to a count of six is easier.
 
6. Pause briefly again.
 
7. Inhale the same way you did in Step 3, slowly through your nose to a 
slow count of four.
 
 Check to see that your hand rises from your abdomen. Your chest 
should move only slightly and in tandem with your stomach.
 
8. Pause and hold your breath briefly.
 
9. Exhale as you did in Step 5, to a slow count of six.
 
10. Continue breathing in and out in this fashion for five minutes.
 
11. Check out your body again for tension, and rate that tension on a 
scale of 1 to 10.
We recommend that you do this abdominal breathing exercise at least once a 
day for five minutes, ten days in a row. For that matter, it isn’t difficult to do 
this four or five times each day — your gains will pile up more quickly. You 
can do this breathing just about anywhere, anytime. You’ll find it relaxing, 
and it won’t add stress to your day by taking away valuable time. After you 
do that, try noticing your breathing at various times during your regular rou-
tine. You’ll quickly see whether you’re breathing through the diaphragm or 
the upper chest like so many people do. Allow your diaphragm to take charge 
of your breathing. Slowly but surely, abdominal breathing can become a new 
habit that decreases your stress.
 
Consider keeping a record of your tension levels before and after this exercise. 
Over time you’re likely to see concrete evidence that it works.
 
Whenever you feel anxiety or panic coming on, try using abdominal breathing. 
You may head it off at the pass. On the other hand, anxiety, and especially 
panic, may rise to a level that makes these exercises more difficult. If that 
happens to you, try the panic-breathing technique that we explain in the next 
section.

185
 Chapter 11: Relaxation: The Five-Minute Solution
Using panic breathing in 
high-stress situations
 
Now and then, you need a faster, more powerful technique to relax. Perhaps 
you went to the mall and felt trapped, or maybe you were on your way to a job 
interview and felt overwhelmed. Whatever the situation, when stress hits you 
unexpectedly, try our panic-breathing technique:
 
1. Inhale deeply and slowly through your nose.
 
2. Hold your breath for a slow count of six.
 
3. Slowly breathe out through your lips to a count of eight, making a 
slight hissing sound as you do.
 
 That sound can be so soft that only you can hear it. You don’t have to 
worry about anyone around you thinking that you’re crazy.
 
4. Repeat this type of breath five or ten times.
You may think that panic breathing is difficult to do when stress strikes sud-
denly. We won’t deny it takes some practice. The key is the slight hissing 
sound, which gives you a much easier way to slow down your breath.
 
If panic breathing doesn’t help, and you feel like you may be having a full-
blown panic attack that won’t go away, try breathing in and out of a paper bag 
with the opening wrapped around your mouth. Breathing this way rebalances 
the ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide and should cut the panic attack short. 
When you breathe too rapidly, your body accumulates an excess of oxygen, 
although it feels like you have too little of it. Breathing in the bag brings the 
level of carbon dioxide up to normal.
 
Don’t start carrying a paper bag with you everywhere you go. You need to 
learn to cope with the fact that sometimes, panic attacks just happen and that 
you’ll live through them if they do.
The benefits of controlled breathing
Just in case you think that breathing better 
sounds like a rather unimaginative, simple way 
of reducing anxiety, you may want to consider 
its healthy effects. Studies show that training 
in breathing can contribute to the reduction of 
panic attacks within a matter of a few weeks. 
Other studies have indicated that controlled 
breathing can slightly reduce blood pressure, 
improve the heart’s rhythm, reduce certain 
types of epileptic seizures, sharpen mental 
performance, increase blood circulation, quell 
worry, and possibly even improve the outcome 
of cardiac rehabilitation efforts following a 
heart attack. Not a bad list of benefits for such 
a simple skill.

186
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
Relaxing Your Whole Body
Some of you may find that breathing techniques quell your anxiety quickly. 
Others may require a technique that directly aims at total body relaxation. 
Relaxing your body takes some time and practice, but it’s worth it.
Over a half century ago, Dr. Edmund Jacobsen, a Chicago physician, devel-
oped what has come to be the most widely used relaxation technique in the 
United States, progressive muscle relaxation. You can find a wide variety of 
similar techniques, all described as progressive muscle relaxation, in various 
books and journals. Each of them may use different muscle groups or pro-
ceed in a different order, but they all do essentially the same thing.
Progressive muscle relaxation involves going through various muscle groups 
in the body and tensing each one for a little while, followed by a quick letting 
go of the tension. You then attend to the sensation of release, noticing how 
the limp muscles feel in contrast to their previous tense state.
Knowing what to expect
 
You’ll find it useful to look for the right place to do your progressive muscle 
relaxation. You probably don’t have a soundproof room, but find the quietest 
place that you can. Consider turning the phones to silent mode. Choose some 
comfortable clothing, or at least loosen any clothing you’re wearing that’s tight 
and constricting. You don’t need shoes, belts, or anything uncomfortable.
Realize that when you begin tensing each muscle group, you shouldn’t over-
exert; don’t tighten using more than about two-thirds of all your effort. When 
you tense, hold it for six to ten seconds and notice how the tension feels. 
Then let go of the tension all at the same time, as though a string holding the 
muscle up were cut loose.
After you release the muscle, focus on the relaxed feeling and allow it to deepen 
for 10 or 15 seconds. If you don’t achieve a desired state of relaxation for that 
muscle group, you can do the procedure one or two more times if you want.
 
You should know that you can’t make relaxation happen. You allow it to 
happen. Perfectionists struggle with this idea. Don’t force it, and rid your mind 
of the idea that you must do this exercise perfectly.
 
When you tighten one muscle group, try to keep all the other muscles in your 
body relaxed. Doing this takes a little practice, but you can figure out how to 
tense one body area at a time. Keep your face especially relaxed when you’re 
tensing any area other than your face. Yoga instructors often say, “Soften your 
eyes.” We’re not exactly sure what that means, but it seems to help.

187
 Chapter 11: Relaxation: The Five-Minute Solution
 
Occasionally, relaxation training makes people feel surprisingly uncomfort-
able. If this happens to you, stop. If it continues to occur with repeated prac-
tice, you may want to seek professional help. Also, don’t tighten any body part 
that hurts. Avoid tightening any area that has suffered injury or has given you 
trouble, such as a lower back.
Discovering the progressive 
muscle technique
 
After you’ve read through the tips in the preceding section, you’re ready to 
start. Sit down in your chosen place and get comfortable.
 
1. Take a deep breath, hold, imagine, and let the tension go.
 
 Pulling the air into your abdomen, breathe deeply. Hold your breath 
for three or four seconds, and then slowly let the air out. Imagine your 
whole body is a balloon losing air as you exhale, and let tension go out 
with the air. Take three more such breaths and feel your entire body get-
ting more limp with each one.
 
2. Squeeze your hands tight and then relax.
 
 Squeeze your fingers into a fist. Feel the tension and hold it for six to 
ten seconds. Then, all at once, release your hands and let them go limp. 
Allow the tension in your hands to flow out. Let the relaxation deepen 
for 10 to 15 seconds.
 
3. Tighten your arms and then relax.
 
 Bring your lower arms up almost to your shoulders and tighten the mus-
cles. Make sure you tense the muscles on the inside and outside of both 
the upper and lower arms. If you’re not sure you’re doing that, use one 
hand to do a tension check on the other arm. Hold the tension a little 
while, and then drop your arms as though you cut a string holding them 
up. Let the tension flow out and the relaxation flow in.
 
4. Raise up your shoulders, tighten, and then relax.
 
 Raise your shoulders up as though you were a turtle trying to get into its 
shell. Hold the tension and then let your shoulders drop. Feel the relax-
ation deepen for 10 to 15 seconds.
 
5. Tighten and relax the muscles in your upper back.
 
 Pull your shoulders back and bring your shoulder blades closer 
together. Hold that tension a little while . . . then let it go.
 
6. Scrunch up your entire face, and then relax.
 
 Squeeze your forehead down, bring your jaws together, tighten your 
eyes and eyebrows, and contract your tongue and lips. Let the tension 
grow and hold it . . . then relax and let go.

188
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
 
7. Tighten and relax your neck in the back of your head.
 
 Gently pull your head back toward your back and feel the muscles 
tighten in the back of your neck. If you feel any pain, ease up to avoid 
hurting your neck. Notice the tension and hold it, then let go and relax. 
Feel the relaxation deepening.
 
8. Contract the front neck muscles and then loosen.
 
 Gently move your chin toward your chest. Tighten your neck muscles, 
let the tension increase, and maintain it; then relax. Feel the tension 
melting away like candle wax.
 
9. Tighten the muscles in your stomach and chest and maintain the ten-
sion. Then let it go.
 
10. Arch your back, hang on to the contraction, and then relax.
 
 Be gentle with your lower back. Tighten these muscles by arching your 
lower back, pressing it back against the chair, or tensing the muscles 
any way you want. Gently increase and maintain the tension, but don’t 
overdo it. Now, relax and allow the waves to roll in.
 
11. Contract and relax your buttocks muscles.
 
 Tighten your buttocks so as to gently lift yourself up in your chair. Hold 
the tension. Then let the tension melt and the relaxation grow.
 
12. Squeeze and relax your thigh muscles.
 
 Tighten and hold these muscles. Then relax and feel the tension draining 
out; let the calm deepen and spread.
 
13. Contract and relax your calves.
 
 Tighten the muscles in your calves by pulling your toes toward your 
face. Take care: If you’re prone to muscle cramps, don’t overdo it. Hold 
the tension . . . then let go. Let the tension drain into the floor.
 
14. Gently curl your toes, maintain the tension, and then relax.
 
15. Take a little time to tour your entire body.
 
 Notice whether you feel better than when you began. If you find areas 
of tension, allow the relaxed areas around them to come in and replace 
them. If that doesn’t work, repeat the procedure for the tense area.
 
16. Spend a few minutes enjoying the relaxed feelings.
 
 Let relaxation spread and penetrate every muscle fiber in your body. 
Notice any sensations you have. Whatever you feel, allow it to happen. 
When you’re ready, you can open your eyes and go on with your day, 
perhaps feeling like you just returned from a brief vacation.
Some people like to make a recording of the progressive muscle relaxation 
instructions to facilitate their efforts. If you do, be sure to make your record-
ing in a slow, calming voice.

189
 Chapter 11: Relaxation: The Five-Minute Solution
In the beginning, take a little longer than five minutes to go through the steps 
of progressive muscle relaxation. Taking 20 or 30 minutes several times at 
first usually works better. However, the more you practice, the more quickly 
you’ll find that you can slide into serenity. Shorten the procedure as you 
progress. For example, you can tense all the muscles in your lower body at 
once, followed by all your upper body muscles. At other times, you may want 
to simply tense and relax a few body areas that carry most of your tension. 
Most often, that involves the neck, shoulder, and back muscles. Some folks 
discover that they can relax in a single minute after they become proficient.
Applying Relaxation in Tense Situations
Discovering how to relax using breathing techniques or progressive muscle 
relaxation may help you reduce your anxiety. But if you just do these activi-
ties when you’re lying around in bed or spending a quiet day at home, you 
miss the opportunity to challenge your fears with a powerful tool. Applied 
relaxation means taking the techniques that you’ve practiced and putting 
them to work when you’re under the most stress.
The key to success lies in the mastery of the technique in nonstressful set-
tings before taking the next step. For example, maybe you’ve practiced the 
progressive relaxation technique many times, and you can tighten and loosen 
your muscles, achieving a state of relaxation in just a few minutes.
Extolling the virtues of progressive 
muscle relaxation
Many people believe that for a remedy to be 
truly effective, it must take plenty of work and 
possibly feel a little painful — the no pain, no 
gain philosophy. As you can see, progressive 
muscle relaxation isn’t especially arduous, and 
it actually feels good, so can it really do anything 
for you? Well, for starters, progressive relax-
ation training is usually a component of most 
successful treatment programs for anxiety.
However, studies also show that progres-
sive muscle relaxation can effectively reduce 
various types of chronic pain, such as the pain 
associated with ulcerative colitis, cancer, and 
headaches. It also works to reduce insomnia. A 
study published in the December 2001 issue of 
the Journal of Clinical Psychology found that in 
addition to inducing greater relaxation, progres-
sive muscle relaxation also led to increased 
mental quiet and joy. Other studies have sug-
gested that it may improve the functioning of 
your immune system. We aren’t suggesting that 
progressive muscle relaxation cures cancer, 
and it won’t whisk away all your pain or eradi-
cate all your anxiety. However, many studies 
clearly show that it exerts benefits across a 
surprisingly wide range of problems. We rec-
ommend that you give it a try.

190
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
Now that you’ve mastered the technique in a nonstressful setting, think of a 
particular situation that frightens you, such as public speaking. For example, 
say you’ve scheduled a speaking engagement for a large event with an audi-
ence of several hundred people. Before your speech, you practice your favor-
ite relaxation technique. You try to maintain that state as you walk up to give 
your speech, but you panic anyway. What happened? You tried to take on too 
much all at once.
 
Applied relaxation works best if you break the tasks into more manageable 
steps. For example, you could practice relaxation while thinking about giving 
your talk. Then you could practice relaxation just before giving your talk to 
a small audience rather than a large group. Continue your practice in small, 
graduated steps.
Relaxing through Your Senses
Your path to finding relaxation may lead you through a variety of experi-
ences. We can’t possibly know which direction will work best for you. You 
have to experiment with various approaches to discover your own relaxation 
remedy. In this section, we ask that you allow your senses to soothe you.
Sounds to soothe the savage beast
Ever since people have populated the planet, they’ve turned to music for 
comfort. From primitive drums to symphony orchestras, sound elicits 
emotions — love, excitement, fear — and even relaxation. An entire profes-
sion of music therapists has capitalized on the power of music. Music thera-
pists work in hospitals, schools, and nursing homes using sounds to soothe.
But you don’t need to be a music therapist to make use of music’s power. 
You probably already know what type of music calms you. Perhaps you love 
classical music or jazz. You may not have thought of trying out a CD of ocean 
waves, babbling brooks, whispering wind, or other sounds of nature. Many 
people find those sounds quite relaxing.
Visit any well-supplied music store or Web site and you’ll find an extensive 
array of possibilities. Experiment with new sounds. Many of these recordings 
boast of containing specially mixed music for optimal relaxation.
 
Buyer beware! Don’t buy just any recording that promises relaxation. 
Unfortunately, some of these products are rather inferior. Either get recom-
mendations or listen to a sample.

191
 Chapter 11: Relaxation: The Five-Minute Solution
Only the nose knows for sure
Ever walk through a mall and smell freshly baked cinnamon rolls? Perhaps 
you were tempted to buy one just because of the aroma. We suspect that the 
smell of the delicacies is no accident; rather, we think that the bakers must 
pump the air up and out from around their ovens into the entire mall ventila-
tion system, knowing the powerful effects of aroma.
In addition to making you hungry, the cinnamon roll scent may also elicit pleas-
ant emotions and memories. Perhaps it takes you back to Sunday mornings 
when your mother baked fresh rolls or to a pleasant café. If so, the aroma auto-
matically brings back memories — no effort required on your part.
A huge perfume industry uses the power of aromas to attract and seduce. 
Manufacturers of deodorants, lotions, powders, hair sprays, and air fresh-
eners do the same, and you can explore the ability of aroma to calm your 
jangled nerves.
Aromatherapy makes use of essential oils, which are natural substances 
extracted from plants. These substances ostensibly affect both physical and 
emotional health. We can’t vouch for these claims, because good studies 
on their effects are lacking. However, the theory behind aromatherapy isn’t 
entirely wacky, because our bodies have nerves that transmit messages from 
the nose into the parts of the brain that control mood, memories, and appetite.
 
If you’re physically sick, please consult a qualified doctor, because aromather-
apy isn’t likely to cure you. No one knows whether aromatherapy promotes 
good health. Also, don’t use these substances if you’re pregnant.
However, if you want to experiment with various aromas to see if any of them 
help you relax, go for it. Preliminary studies have suggested that certain 
aromas may alleviate anxiety and decrease nicotine withdrawal symptoms 
and headaches.
 
Consider the following aromatherapy scent suggestions, but be sure to shop 
around because prices can vary substantially. A trusted local health-food 
store may be a good place to start.
 
✓ Chamomile
 
✓ Eucalyptus
 
✓ Lavender
 
✓ Neroli (citrus aurantium)
These essential oils may help relieve anxiety and combat sleeplessness. 
Besides, they smell pretty good, so put a few drops in your warm bath or on 
your pillow. Have a good sleep.

Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
Massaging away stress
About 15 times a day, one of our dogs sticks his nose under one of our arms 
to indicate that he’s overdue for a rubdown. Dogs unabashedly beg for touch-
ing, petting, and rubbing. Our dogs are pretty good at getting it, too.
People need to be touched, too. It’s great to be hugged and stroked by the 
people we care about. However, one wonderful way to satisfy the need to 
be touched and relax at the same time is through a professional massage. If 
you’ve never indulged, consider treating yourself to a massage. In years past, 
only the elite sought massage therapy. Today, people flock to massage thera-
pists to reduce stress, to manage pain, and to just plain feel good.
 
Another way of getting a massage is to sit in a whirlpool for five minutes. 
This can be relaxing because, in addition to the massage that you get from 
the force of the water jets, the feel of the warm water that’s forced into the 
whirlpool and the sound of the water rushing around also has a calming effect. 
Although some homes have whirlpools built into their bathtubs, most health 
spas and YMCAs/YWCAs also have whirlpools that patrons can enjoy for a 
small fee in addition to the cost of a basic membership.
Everybody needs touching
In the 1940s, many European babies ended up 
in orphanages. A shocking number of these 
orphans failed to grow or interact with others, 
and some appeared to wilt away and die for no 
discernible reason. They had sufficient food, 
clothing, and shelter. A physician named Dr. 
Rene Spitz investigated and found that their 
failure to thrive appeared to be due to a lack 
of human touch. In other words, the caregivers 
provided nutrients but not contact.
This early finding has been supported by 
numerous studies conducted by psychologist 
Tiffany Field and her colleagues. One of these 
studies found that premature infants who were 
given regular massages gained more weight 
than those who merely received standard 
medical care. Other studies by this research 
group have included normal babies, as well as 
infants born with HIV or cocaine addiction, and 
young children with diabetes, eating disorders, 
and asthma. Babies and children who receive 
a massage regularly have lower amounts of 
stress hormones and lower levels of anxiety 
than those who don’t. Other benefits that were 
identified include pain reduction, increased 
attentiveness, and enhanced immune function. 
If it’s this good for babies, we figure that it’s 
pretty good for you, too. Indulge!

Chapter 12
Creating Calm in Your Imagination
In This Chapter
▶ Honing the powers of your imagination
▶ Imagining your way to relaxation
▶ Creating your own images
P
eople who have a vivid imagination (perhaps this describes you) can 
think themselves into all kinds of anxious situations. Just give them a 
moment to play with an idea, and they’re off on another anxiety trip.
But the good news is that you can backtrack and rewind your mind to a 
calmer place. One way to do that is through guided imagery. Guided imagery 
creates a calm place by using your imagination to put yourself into a state 
of relaxation and peace. Your mind takes you to a pleasant, beautiful, serene 
time or space. The best images incorporate all your senses. When visualizing 
them, you see, hear, smell, feel, and possibly taste them. For example, you 
might imagine hearing birds, smelling flowers, feeling a slight breeze, and 
enjoying the taste of chocolate in the middle of a beautiful meadow.
Some people find that breathing exercises or progressive relaxation don’t get 
them sufficiently relaxed. In those cases, guided imagery is often a good alter-
native. The following example demonstrates the usefulness of guided imagery.
Tense thoughts fill Shauna’s every waking moment. From the time that 
she springs out of bed in the morning to the last gripping thought before 
restless sleep mercifully overtakes her, Shauna thinks. She replays every 
anxious moment at her job and dwells on each imagined error that she’s 
made during the day, turning it over and over in her mind. She visualizes 
every flaw in her makeup, dress, and complexion. Images of incompe-
tence, inadequacy, and unattractiveness flood her mind’s eye.
To reduce the stress and anxiety that saturate the scenes in her mind, 
she decides to seek the services of a counselor. The counselor teaches 
her several breathing techniques, but Shauna can’t hold back the ava-
lanche of anxious images. She tries progressive muscle relaxation, 
massage, and then music and aromatherapy to no avail. Finally, her 
counselor has an insight. “Shauna thinks in pictures; she needs guided 
imagery!”

194
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
In Shauna’s case, her day-to-day images were full of anxiety-arousing situa-
tions. When she tried other relaxation techniques, they failed because anx-
ious images still filled her mind. With guided imagery, however, the richness 
of the peaceful experience pushed aside all other concerns.
In this chapter, we show you how to improve your imagination. Then we give 
you several scripts to play with in your mind. Feel free to revise them any 
way you want. Finally, you can customize your own special mental images.
Letting Your Imagination Roam
Some people, thinking of themselves as rather unimaginative, struggle to 
create pictures in their minds. These people generally feel uncomfortable 
with their drawing skills and have a hard time recalling the details of events 
they’ve witnessed. Perhaps you’re one of them. If so, using your imagination 
to relax and reduce your anxiety may not be the approach for you.
On the other hand, it just might. Guided imagery encompasses more than 
the visual sense; it includes smell, taste, touch, and sound. We can help you 
sharpen your ability to use all these senses.
 
We encourage you to give these exercises a shot, but all people have different 
strengths and weaknesses, and you may find that one or more of these exer-
cises just don’t work for you. If you discover that guided imagery isn’t for you, 
that’s okay. For example, some folks have problems with hearing, sight, or 
smell that could impede their ability to use certain techniques based on those 
senses. Not to worry — this book discusses many other ways to relax.
We don’t want to make you more anxious by telling you these exercises must 
be done in a certain order or frequency. Try them out as you wish. Our editor 
found herself surprisingly relaxed at work after reading about these tech-
niques! But watch out; don’t fall asleep on the job.
 
Just before doing each series of numbered steps for the guided imagery exer-
cises in this chapter, do the following:
 
1. Find a comfortable place to sit or lie down.
 
2. Make sure that you loosen any tight garments and shoes.
 
3. Close your eyes and take a few slow, deep breaths.

195
 Chapter 12: Creating Calm in Your Imagination
Imagining touch
Imagery exercises work best if they incorporate more than one sense. 
Imagining bodily sensations enhances the overall experience of relaxing, 
guided imagery. Take the following steps to see how this works:
 
1. Imagine an oversized, sunken bathtub.
 
2. Picture yourself turning the faucet on and feeling the water coming 
out.
 
 You can feel that the water is cold and wet as it pours over your hand. 
Gradually, the temperature increases until it reaches your perfect range.
 
3. The tub fills, and you mentally see yourself pouring bath oil in and 
mixing it around.
 
 You can feel how silky the water becomes.
 
4. You imagine putting your foot in the water.
 
 The water feels just a bit too hot at first, but you find that the warm tem-
perature soothes you after lowering your body into the bathtub.
 
5. You lay back and luxuriate in the slick, smooth, warm water.
 
 You can feel it envelop you as the warmth loosens your muscles.
Were you able to feel the sensations: the wetness and the silky warmth? If 
not, don’t despair. You can improve your awareness by spending just five 
minutes a day actively participating in a real experience and then committing 
that experience to your memory. 
 
Try one or more of the following exercises each day for five days straight. You 
can experiment with other exercises, too. Just be sure to focus on touch.
 
✓ Hold your hands under different temperatures of water. Notice how 
they feel. Better yet, fill the basin and submerge your hands to conserve 
water.
 
✓ Rub oil on the back of your hand and wrist. Notice how the oil feels.
 
✓ Take a warm bath and notice the sensations of wetness, warmth, and 
silkiness. Focus on all your bodily sensations.
 
✓ Put a washcloth in hot water, wring it out, and press it to your fore-
head. Notice the warmth and the texture of the cloth.
 
✓ Sit in front of the fireplace and notice where the heat hits your body. 
Experience the warmth.

196
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
After participating in one of the preceding exercises, wait one minute. Then 
try to conjure up what the sensations felt like in your mind. The following 
day, do the exercise, wait five minutes, and then recall the sensations. Each 
day, make the length of time between the actual experience and your recol-
lection of the experience a little longer.
Recalling sounds
You don’t have to be a musician to appreciate music or to re-create it in your 
mind. Guided imagery often asks you to create the sounds of nature in your 
mind to enhance relaxation. Taking the following steps, try imagining what an 
ocean beach sounds like:
 
1. Imagine that you’re lying on a beach.
 
 You can hear the ocean waves rolling in one after the other. In and out. 
The soft roar soothes and relaxes. In and out.
 
2. In your mind, you hear each wave rolling in and coming to a cre-
scendo as it breaks gently onto the beach.
 
 A brief moment of quiet follows as the next wave prepares to roll in. A 
few seagulls cry out as they fly overhead.
Were you able to hear the ocean and the gulls? You can improve your abil-
ity to re-create sounds in your mind by actively experiencing the real McCoy 
beforehand. 
 
Try some of the following exercises for just five minutes a day for five days. 
You may think of some other ways to practice listening to sounds with your 
mind’s eye, too.
 
✓ Listen to a short passage from a favorite song. Play it several times and 
listen to each note. Tune in and concentrate.
 
✓ Sit in a chair in your living room and listen. Turn off the phones, ste-
reos, and anything else cranking out noise. Closing your eyes and listen-
ing carefully, notice every sound that you hear — perhaps the traffic 
outside, a dog barking, a little wind, or the house creaking.
 
✓ Listen to the sound of yourself eating an apple, a celery stick, or 
a carrot. Not only is it good for you, but you’ll also hear interesting 
sounds. Eat slowly and hear each crunch. Notice the initial sharp sound 
of biting and the more muted chewing.
Following your experience, wait one minute. Then reproduce the sounds in 
your mind. Hear them again. Don’t worry if you can’t do it. With practice, 

197
 Chapter 12: Creating Calm in Your Imagination
you’re likely to get better. Increase the wait between the actual experience 
and your recollection a little each day.
Remembering tastes
Which foods do you associate with comfort and relaxation? Many people 
think of chicken soup or herbal tea. One of us spreads peanut butter on toast 
when really stressed, and the other occasionally indulges in ice cream — 
especially chocolate and caramel swirls threaded through rich vanilla. Are 
you salivating yet? If not, try playing out this imaginary scene:
 
1. Imagine an exquisite chocolate truffle.
 
 You’re not sure what’s inside, but you look forward to finding out.
 
2. In your mind, you bring the truffle to your lips and slowly bite off a 
corner of the truffle.
 
 The rich, sweet chocolate coats your tongue.
 
3. Imagine taking another bite and detecting a creamy, fruity center.
 
 You’ve never tasted anything so rich and delectable yet not overpower-
ing. The sweet but slightly tangy cherry flavor fills your body with 
satisfaction.
Could you taste the truffle in your imagination? Perhaps you found it easier 
than the smell. Either way, you can improve your ability to recall tastes with 
practice. Try one or more of these exercises:
 
✓ Bake some fresh, iced brownies. Okay, you can pick some up from a 
bakery if you must. First, taste the brownie with the tip of your tongue. 
Hold it in your mouth and move it to different spots on your tongue. 
Then chew it and notice the icing and the cake flavors mixing together.
 
✓ Open and heat up a can of your favorite soup. Pour a little into a cup 
or bowl. Put a small spoonful into your mouth. Be sure it’s not too hot. 
Notice how the soup tastes on every part of your tongue.
You can do this taste-focusing activity with any food that you want. The key 
is to take some time and focus. Savor the flavors and pay attention to the 
nuances — sweet, sour, bitter, or salty. Again, try to call the tastes to mind 
after about a minute. Then stretch out the period between the actual experi-
ence and the recall a little longer each time you practice.

198
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
Conjuring up smells
Our dogs have a far better sense of smell than we do. They seem to know 
exactly which bush on their walking route needs re-marking. We’re pretty 
sure that they know exactly which rival dog did what to which bush. Perhaps 
the fact that we can’t smell as well as they can is a good thing.
But smell has a powerful influence on people as well. Certain smells alert us 
to danger, such as the smell of smoke or spoiling food. Other smells inevi-
tably conjure up pleasant memories and feelings, such as the aroma of your 
favorite baked delight or the perfumed scent of a loved one. See whether this 
description brings a smell wafting into your mind:
 
1. Imagine that you’re sleeping on a screened porch in a country cottage 
nestled in the forest.
 
 You’ve been aware of a slow, steady rainfall through the night. When 
you awaken, the sun is shining.
 
2. In your mind, you can smell the sweet aroma of freshly cleaned air, 
crisp and cool.
 
 The earthy smell of the forest floor washed by nature reaches your 
awareness.
 
3. You stretch and breathe deeply.
 
 You detect the musty odor of fallen leaves. A pleasant, refreshing feeling 
engulfs you.
How did this scene smell in your mind? Smell is a primitive sense and may 
not be as easy to consciously produce with your imagination. That may be 
because a description of smell is more difficult to put into words. However, 
with practice, you’re likely to improve. 
 
Try a few of these activities to help you develop your imagination’s sense of 
smell:
 
✓ Make a cup of hot chocolate. Before drinking it, spend a minute taking 
in the aroma. Focus on the smell as you take each sip.
 
✓ Bake dinner rolls. Don’t worry; you can buy the ready-made kind that 
you pop out onto a cookie sheet. Sit in the kitchen while they bake. 
Open the oven door a couple of times to intensify the experience.
 
✓ Visit a department store, go to the perfume counter, and test several 
different scents. Try to describe the differences.
Now try to remember what smell you experienced a minute later. Take a little 
longer each day before trying to recall the odors.

 Chapter 12: Creating Calm in Your Imagination
Painting pictures in your mind
Many of our clients report that scenes of anticipated disasters and doom 
invade their imagination. These scenes cause them more anxiety than actual 
disastrous events usually do. Visual imagery can fuel your anxiety, or you 
can enlist your visual imagination to help you drown the fires of anxiety. Try 
painting this picture in your mind:
 
1. Imagine that you’re at a mountain resort in late spring.
 
2. In your mind, you spent the day trekking through a forest. Now, 
you’re relaxing on the deck of your cabin overlooking a valley lake 
ringed by mountain peaks.
 
 The water on the lake is still; the dark blue surface reflects surprisingly 
clear images of the trees and mountains. The sun sinks behind a moun-
tain peak, painting the clouds above in brilliant hues of red, orange, and 
pink. The mountains remain capped with snow from the winter. Dark 
green fir trees stand proudly above a carpet of pine cones and needles.
How did this scene look in your mind? If you practice sharpening your visual 
imagery, you’ll become an expert eyewitness. Wherever you are, take one 
minute to inspect the view in front of you. It doesn’t matter what that is. 
Scrutinize the image from every angle. Notice colors, textures, shapes, pro-
portions, and positions. Then close your eyes. Try to recollect the images 
in your mind. Focus on every detail. You can practice this anywhere and 
anytime. It just takes a few minutes. Each day, delay your imagery retrieval a 
little longer after turning away from the scene that you just studied.
Mindfulness: Finding peace in the present
Our sense-sharpening exercises actually form 
part of a more powerful approach to overcom-
ing anxiety — mindfulness, which we discuss 
in greater depth in Chapter 13. A technique that 
has been used for several thousands of years 
in both the secular and religious settings of the 
Far East, mindfulness involves immersing your-
self in the present with full awareness. When 
you fully attend to your immediate surround-
ings, catastrophic predictions about the future 
fade and anxiety drops.
Mindfulness has only recently found its way 
into Western psychology. However, in the past 
few years, researchers have discovered that 
training in mindfulness can substantially sup-
plement other approaches to anxiety reduction. 
We recommend that you work on sharpening 
your awareness of your experiences, and then 
read Chapter 13 to discover more.

Full Sensory Imaging
The best and most effective guided imagery incorporates multiple senses — 
not necessarily every one, every time, but for the most part, the more the 
better. If you aren’t as adept at using one or two senses, try to focus on using 
your more-developed senses. We have a couple of imaginary scenes in the 
upcoming sections for you to try that use most of your senses to recall an 
experience.
If you like our scenes, use them. Perhaps you’ll want to make a recording of 
one or both of them. If you do, feel free to modify the scene in any way that 
helps you to imagine it more vividly or feel more at peace. At a time when 
you’re feeling relaxed, make an audio recording of yourself reading the fol-
lowing sections. Then listen to the recording at a later time to help you relax. 
Perhaps you can play a recording of ocean sounds in the background as you 
read and record the “Relaxing at the beach” exercise. Similarly, you may play 
a recording of forest sounds as you tape yourself reading “A forest fantasy.” 
Commercial recordings are also available.
Relaxing at the beach
 
Let this scene transport you to a quiet beach where your cares can melt away.
 
1. Imagine that you’re walking barefoot through a sandy beach on a 
warm, sunny day.
 
 The sand feels warm between your toes. Reaching the ocean shore and 
feeling the cool, refreshing water lap over your feet, you smell the crisp, 
salty air and take a deep breath; calmness comes over you.
 
2. You walk farther and reach an area where rocks jut out into the surf.
 
 A wave crashes onto the rocks and sends a fine mist high into the air; 
small droplets spray on your face and feel delightfully refreshing.
 
3. Seagulls glide effortlessly high above and then dive, skimming the sur-
face of the water.
 
 They look like acrobats of the sky, gracefully soaring in and out of sight. 
The surf and the seagulls orchestrate a soothing soundtrack. A wooden 
Adirondack chair beckons you farther down the beach.
 
4. You stroll over to the chair and stretch out on it when you get there.
 
 The wood warmed by the sun is smooth against your skin.
 
5. Magically, a frosted glass of your favorite beverage appears on a small 
side table.
 
6. Sipping and feeling the cold liquid fill your mouth and slide down 
your throat, you feel refreshed and satisfied, serene and content.

201
 Chapter 12: Creating Calm in Your Imagination
 
7. You take a look out at the horizon and see a couple of sailboats float-
ing lazily in the distance.
 
 You feel the warm sun bathe your skin; at the same time, a gentle breeze 
cools your skin to a perfect balance. You’ve never felt so relaxed in your 
life.
 
8. You lie back and close your eyes.
 
 You can feel all the muscles in your body let go. You feel sleepy but alert 
at the same time. Nature’s beauty fills you with awe, melting your wor-
ries away.
A forest fantasy
 
Sometimes a walk in the woods, even an imaginary one, can do wonders for 
your body, mind, and spirit.
 
1. Imagine that you’re walking through pine trees and brush.
 
 The sap of the trees gives off a sweet, pungent aroma. You hear the 
branches rustle in the breeze. Sunlight filters through the branches of 
the trees, making shadows dance across the ground.
 
2. Your feet can feel the spring in the path covered with years of fallen 
leaves.
 
 You hear a brook babbling in the distance.
 
3. You reach into your backpack, take out a container of cold water, and sip.
 
 As you sip, you feel at peace and start to relax. You hear birds overhead.
 
4. As you proceed, the trees begin to thin.
 
 You reach a stream with clear water flowing swiftly over and around the 
small rocks in its bed.
 
5. You bend down to touch the water; it’s cold, clean, and pure.
 
6. You splash a bit of the brisk water over your face and feel cleansed.
 
 Just ahead, you notice a grassy meadow, filled with wildflowers. The 
flowers’ fragrance gently fills the air with sweetness.
 
7. You reach a grassy, soft spot and sit down.
 
 From here, you can see for many miles in the distance. The air is pure 
and clean. The sun feels warm on your skin. The sky is a brilliant blue 
backdrop to a few white, billowy clouds.
 
8. Sleepiness overtakes you and you lie down.
 
 You can feel your entire body relaxing. Your everyday concerns seem 
trivial. All that matters is the moment. You cherish the experience of 
connection to the earth.

Customizing Your Own Images
You may want to create your own imaginary journey. It can be somewhere 
that you’ve been before or somewhere you’ve never seen. Try a few out to 
see how they work for you. Many people use guided imagery to help them go 
to sleep. Others use these images to help them relax before a stressful event, 
such as taking a test. We have a few helpful hints for designing your own 
guided imagery for relaxation:
 
✓ The most important hint is to enjoy yourself.
 
✓ Be creative; let your mind go wild, coming up with any scene that might 
feel good to you.
 
✓ Use multiple senses.
 
✓ Add descriptive details. Consider using a thesaurus for rich adjectives.
 
✓ Make your scene long enough that it lasts a little while. It takes some 
time for your body to relax.
 
✓ Consider playing soothing music or sounds in the background as you 
make the recording.
 
✓ Be sure to include relaxing suggestions, such as “I’m feeling calmer,” 
“My worries are melting away,” or “My body feels loose and relaxed.”
 
✓ Realize that there’s no right or wrong way to design an image. Don’t 
judge your scene.
 
If creating your own imaginary journey doesn’t work for you, don’t sweat it. 
You can find many other ways to relax.
Imagining a positive outcome
Athletes commonly use images to reduce their 
performance anxiety. In addition, many of them 
create images of success. For example, a gym-
nast may envision himself making a perfect dis-
mount off the balance beam over and over. Or 
a runner may see herself pushing through pain, 
stretching her legs out for a first-place finish 
again and again. Various studies indicate that 
imagery can give an athlete an extra boost.
Another way to use imagery is to face your 
fears in a less stressful way than meeting them 
head-on in real life. You do this by repeatedly 
imagining yourself conquering your fears. We 
tell you more about exactly how to do this in 
Chapter 8.

Chapter 13
Mindful Acceptance
In This Chapter
▶ Accepting the struggle of life
▶ Giving up ego to make life easier
▶ Focusing on the present
▶ Practicing mindfulness
▶ Cultivating your spirituality
H
as your car ever been stuck on a muddy road? What happens if you 
gun the accelerator harder when the wheels start to spin? They spin 
even harder, the mud flies everywhere, and the rut gets deeper. Anxiety can 
be like that: The harder you try to break free, the tighter it seems to grip.
In this chapter, we explain how to use acceptance as one way to get out 
of your anxiety trap. Threads of what we call mindful acceptance show up 
throughout this book. We weave the threads together to form a tapestry. 
We show how acceptance helps you stop spinning your wheels so you can 
calmly consider productive alternatives. We discuss how too much con-
cern with ego and self-esteem can make seeing the way out difficult, and we 
explain how living in the present provides a roadway to a more balanced life. 
Finally, we give you some thoughts about the possible role of spirituality in 
finding serenity.
 
When you find yourself stuck in the rut of anxiety, don’t slam down on the 
accelerator. Sit back, let the wheels settle a bit, rock back into the rut, and 
then gently push forward. Eventually, you’ll discover a rhythm of going for-
ward, then rocking back, and your efforts will lead you to solid ground.
Accepting Anxiety? Hey, That’s a Switch!
So why is it that after showing you how to get rid of your anxiety, we tell you 
to mindfully accept it? Have we lost our minds? Isn’t this book supposed to 
be about overcoming anxiety?

204
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
Well, yes, of course we want you to overcome your anxiety. But the paradox 
of anxiety is that the more you feel you must rid yourself of it, the more anx-
ious you feel. The more your anxiety disturbs you, the more it ensnares you.
Imagine going to a carnival or birthday party where someone gives you a 
Chinese handcuff — a little, decorative, woven straw tube. You put both 
index fingers into the tube. Then you try to extract your fingers. The tube 
closes tightly around your fingers. The harder you pull, the tighter the hand-
cuffs squeeze; a way out doesn’t seem to exist. So you pull even harder. 
Eventually, you realize that the only way out is to quit trying.
Anxiety mimics the squeezing of Chinese handcuffs. The more you struggle, 
the more trapped you feel. Insisting that your anxiety go away this second is 
a surefire way to increase it! Instead, sit back and think about your anxiety. 
We describe how in the following sections.
Taking a calm, dispassionate view
Anthropologists study the behavior and culture of human beings. They make 
their observations objectively from a dispassionate, scientific perspective. 
We want you to view your anxiety like an anthropologist — coolly detached.
 
Wait for the next time that you feel anxious. Study your anxiety and prepare 
a report that conveys what anxiety feels like in your body, how it affects your 
thoughts, and what it does to your actions. Don’t judge the anxiety — just 
observe it. Then, being as objective as possible, answer the following ques-
tions in your report:
 
✓ Where in my body do I feel tension? In my shoulders, back, jaw, hands, 
or neck? Study it, and describe how the tension feels.
 
✓ Are my hands sweating?
 
✓ Is my heart racing? If so, how fast?
 
✓ Do I feel tightness in my chest or throat?
 
✓ Do I feel dizzy? Study the dizziness and describe it.
 
✓ What am I thinking? Am I . . .
 
• Making negative predictions about the future?
 
• Making a mountain out of a molehill?
 
• Turning an unpleasant event into a catastrophe?
 
• Upset about something that’s outside of my control?

205
 Chapter 13: Mindful Acceptance
 
✓ What is my anxiety telling me to do?
 
• To avoid doing something that I want to do?
 
• That I need to be perfect?
 
• That I have to cover up my anxiety?
Mel’s story that follows provides a good example of how your powers of 
observation may help you get a handle on your anxious feelings.
Mel, a 38-year-old hospital administrator, experienced his first panic 
attack three years ago. Since then, his attacks have increased in fre-
quency and intensity, and he’s even started to miss work on days when 
he feared having to lead staff meetings.
Now, he works with a therapist to decrease his panic. The therapist 
notices that Mel’s perfectionism drives him to demand instant improve-
ment. He reads everything he’s assigned and tries to do every task per-
fectly. The therapist, realizing that Mel needs to slow down and back up, 
gives him an assignment to pretend that he’s an anthropologist on a mis-
sion and to write a report about his anxiety. Mel completes the assign-
ment as follows:
I started noticing a little shortness of breath. I thought: It’s starting again! 
Then my heart began to race. I noticed it was beating fast and I wondered 
how long it would last. Then I noticed that my hands were sweating. I felt 
nauseous. I didn’t want to go to work. I could almost hear the anxiety tell-
ing me that I would feel much better if I stayed home because if I went to 
work, I’d have to talk to a room full of upset surgeons. I have to tell them 
about the new billing procedures. They’re not going to like it. They’ll 
probably rip me to shreds. What an interesting image. I’ve never really 
been ripped into shreds, but my image is amazing! If I get too anxious, my 
words will turn into nonsense, and I’ll look like a total fool. This is inter-
esting, too. I’m making incredibly negative predictions about the future. 
It’s funny — as I say that, I feel just a tiny bit less anxious.
Mel discovered that letting go and merely observing his anxiety helped. 
Rather than attack his anxious feelings and thoughts, he watched and pon-
dered his experience by really trying to emulate the sense of scientific curios-
ity of anthropologists.
Tolerating uncertainty
Anxious people usually detest uncertainty. If only they could control every-
thing around them, they might not worry so much, and that’s probably true: 
If you could control everything, you wouldn’t have much cause for worry, 
would you?

206
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
The rather obvious flaw in this approach lies in the fact that life consists of 
constant uncertainty and a degree of chaos. In fact, a basic law of physics 
states that, even in so-called hard sciences, absolute certainty is nonexistent. 
Accidents and unforeseen events happen.
For example, you don’t know the day and time that your car will break down 
on the way to work. You can’t predict the stock market, although many 
people try. Bad things happen to good people all the time. Even if you spent 
every moment of your waking life trying to prevent illness, financial difficul-
ties, and loss of loved ones, you couldn’t do it.
Not only is the task of preventing calamities impossible, you can easily ruin 
most of your present moments if you try. Think about it. If you check your 
car’s engine before leaving for work each day, if you scrimp and save every 
possible penny for retirement, if you never eat ice cream because of the fat 
content, if you overprotect your children because you worry that they’ll get 
into trouble, if you wash your hands every time you touch a doorknob, if you 
never take a risk, then what will your life be like? Probably not much fun.
 
Worry doesn’t change what will happen. Some people think that if they worry 
enough, bad things won’t occur. Because bad things don’t happen to them on 
most of those worry days, they feel like their worrying has paid off. But worry 
by itself has never in the history of humans prevented anything from happen-
ing. Not once.
Find out how to embrace uncertainty, which can make life both interesting 
and exciting. Discover how to appreciate adversity as well as a little suffering. 
Without some suffering and adversity, you fail to value the good moments.
When you find yourself feeling anxious, ask yourself whether your worry is 
an attempt to control the unpredictable. For example, many people worry 
about their retirement funds in the stock market. They watch how their 
stocks are doing every single day. They scan the newspaper for financial 
information that may possibly help them know when to sell at just the right 
moment. Yet, as the past few years have shown, there are no guarantees in 
the stock market.
 
Let go of your need to predict and control. Of course, take reasonable precau-
tions regarding your health, family, finances, and well-being, but when worry 
about the future invades the present enjoyment of your life, it has gone too 
far. Appreciate uncertainty and live well today.
Being patient with yourself
When you think about patience, what comes to mind? Calm, acceptance, and 
tolerance. When you become anxious, try to be patient and kind with yourself 
and say to yourself,

✓ Okay, I’m feeling anxious. That’s my experience.
 
✓ Like other feelings, anxiety comes and goes.
 
✓ Let me be present with my anxiety.
In the example of Jeanine that follows, Jeanine’s contrasting reactions, first 
with impatience and then with patience, provide an illustration of how you, 
too, can turn your impatience into patience.
Jeanine begins to feel anxious during the morning commute. She leaves 
home at 7:15 a.m. and usually can count on being to work on time at 8 
a.m. Frequently, she arrives about five minutes early, but once a month 
or so, traffic backs up, and she’s a few minutes late. This morning 
appears to be one of those.
The impatient Jeanine: Traffic is at a standstill, and anxiety churns in 
Jeanine’s stomach and builds. Sweating and clutching the steering wheel, 
she begins tracking the ways that she can change lanes and get through a 
bit faster. She hates starting her day out like this. She can’t stand the anx-
iety and tries to get rid of it, but she fails. She visualizes her boss noticing 
her tardiness and the others at her office looking up at her. Anxiety turns 
to anger as she criticizes herself for not leaving earlier.
The patient Jeanine: Traffic is at a standstill, and anxiety churns in 
Jeanine’s stomach. Clutching the steering wheel, she fights the urge to 
change lanes. She notices and accepts the anxiety in her body, thinking, 
“I may be late, but most every morning, I am on time or early. My boss 
and co-workers know that. I can feel my anxiety, but that’s my experi-
ence. How interesting. I’ll arrive a few minutes late this morning, and 
that’s okay.”
In the second scenario, the anxiety dissipates because Jeanine allows herself 
to feel it without judgment or intolerance. She connects to her present situa-
tion with patience.
 
Like everything else, making patience a habit takes practice. You build your 
tolerance for patience over time. Like building muscles by lifting weights, you 
can build the patience muscles in your mind a little at a time.
Letting Go of Ego
Everyone wants to have high self-esteem. Bookstores and libraries display hun-
dreds of books about how to pump up your self-esteem. You may think that 
having high self-esteem would decrease your anxiety. It seems logical anyway.

208
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
However, self-esteem doesn’t work that way. In fact, overly positive self-
esteem causes more anxiety, as well as a host of other ills. Similarly, most 
positive human characteristics and qualities turn into negatives when they 
reach extreme levels. For example, courage, generosity, diligence, and trust 
are all wonderful traits. But excessive courage can make a person reckless, 
excessive generosity can make a person an easy mark for the dishonest, 
excessive focus on work can leave insufficient room for pleasure, and exces-
sive trust can turn someone into a dupe. Perhaps our upcoming description 
of self-esteem as similar to a balloon may help you understand the shocking 
dangers of too much investment in ego and self-esteem.
Inflating and deflating 
the self-esteem balloon
We think of self-esteem like a balloon. Too little self-esteem is like an empty 
balloon. It has no air; it’s flat, deflated, and can’t float. Therefore, a deflated 
balloon isn’t especially fun or useful. If your self-esteem is quite low, you 
probably spend time judging yourself harshly and negatively. Your energy 
probably suffers, and you may feel quite anxious about your perceived 
deficiencies.
Too much ego or self-esteem, however, is like a balloon that’s tightly 
stretched and so full of air that it’s about to explode. One tiny scrape, and 
the balloon bursts. People with too much self-esteem worry constantly about 
those scrapes. Any threat to their self-esteem causes considerable anxiety 
and sometimes anger. You can’t do much in life without running into at least 
some threat to your ego. If your self-esteem balloon is too full of itself, those 
threats can appear especially ominous.
On the other hand, a balloon with just the right amount of air is pretty tough 
to break. It can bounce around easily, joyfully, and playfully. The balloon with 
the right amount of air doesn’t worry so much about crashing or bursting.
In a sense, both the deflated balloon and the one close to the bursting point 
worry plenty about their own state: their condition, worth, and vulnerability. 
The key to having just the right amount of ego — air in the balloon — is to 
have less concern with yourself (along with more concern for others) and 
less worry about how you stack up against others.
 
When you can accept both your positive and negative qualities without being 
overly concerned for either, you’ll have the right amount of air in your ego 
balloon, but that isn’t always so easy to do. It takes a solid focus on learning, 
striving, and working hard — though not to excess.

 Chapter 13: Mindful Acceptance
Appreciating your imperfections
All too often, anxious people feel that they must be perfect in order for others 
to like and accept them. No wonder they feel anxious. Nobody’s perfect, and 
no one ever will be. Take the case of Kelly.
Kelly is perhaps as close to perfect as you can find. Kelly always wears 
exactly the right fashionable clothes, the right colors, and her accesso-
ries always match. She takes classes in interior design so her house has 
just the right look. She exercises four times a week and eats only healthy 
foods. Her makeup, which she applies with great care, appears flawless. 
She always knows just what to say, never stumbling over a single word or 
swearing. She always exhibits kindness and has a positive outlook.
Would you like to have a beer with Kelly? Does she seem like someone you’d 
like to hang out at a pool with on a summer weekend? Would you feel easy 
and natural around Kelly? Frankly, we’d probably pass on the idea of having 
her as one of our best friends.
The seductive power of positive thinking
In the 1950s, self-help gurus began a movement 
by encouraging everyone to pump up their self-
esteem. Before 1950, less than a hundred arti-
cles were written on the topic of self-esteem in 
professional journals; however, in the past ten 
years alone, more than 8,000 such articles have 
appeared in social science journals. In addi-
tion, literally thousands of self-help books have 
promoted the unquestioned value of nurturing 
self-esteem. The self-esteem movement now 
permeates parenting magazines, school cur-
riculums, and bookshelves. It seduced a gen-
eration of parents, teachers, and mental-health 
workers into believing that the best thing that 
they could do for kids was to pump up their self-
esteem.
So has more than a half-century of promot-
ing self-esteem (also known as ego) paid off? 
Hardly. Today, school achievement lags sig-
nificantly behind where it was in 1960. School 
grades, however, are up. School violence is 
much higher than 50 years ago, and the rates 
of depression and anxiety among today’s youth 
are higher than ever.
Why? An incredible number of recent research 
studies show a strong link between the over-
abundant focus on the self and violence, poor 
school achievement, and emotional problems 
of all sorts. Deflated self-esteem also appears 
to be bad for you, but studies suggest that an 
overly inflated self-esteem is even worse. The 
answer appears to lie in having less focus on 
the almighty self.

210
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
Think about one of your good friends with whom you like to spend time, 
someone you enjoy and value, and someone you’ve known for a while. 
Picture that person in your mind and recall some of the good times that 
you’ve spent together. Let yourself enjoy those images. Think about how 
much you appreciate this person and how your life has been enriched by the 
relationship.
Realize that you’ve always known about your friend’s negative qualities and 
imperfections, yet you’ve continued to appreciate your friend. Perhaps you 
even find some of the flaws amusing or interesting. Maybe they give your 
friend color. Thinking about the flaws isn’t likely to change your opinion or 
feelings, either.
Try applying the same perspective to yourself. Appreciate your little flaws, 
foibles, and quirks. They make you interesting and unique. Be a friend 
to yourself. Notice your gifts and your imperfections. Figure out how to 
acknowledge it all as one package. Don’t disown your flaws.
 
Try this exercise we call “Appreciating Flawed Friends.” You’ll likely notice 
that you accept your friend, good and bad, positive or negative.
 
1. In the notebook or file you have for exercises, make two columns. 
Think of a good friend.
 
2. In the first column, write down a couple of the friend’s positive 
qualities.
 
3. In the second column, describe a couple of negative qualities or 
imperfections that your friend has.
Following this exercise, realize that your friends probably have a similar pic-
ture of you. The following example shows you how this particular exercise 
works for Curtis.
Curtis fills in the “Appreciating Flawed Friends” exercise in Table 13-1 
while thinking about his buddy Jack. In the respective columns, he writes 
about Jack’s positive qualities and imperfections.
Curtis accepts Jack, flaws and all. There’s no one that Curtis would rather 
spend time with, and Jack is the first person he would turn to in a crisis. Can 
Curtis accept himself like he does Jack? That’s the task at hand.
If your friend filled out the same form on you, no doubt she would write 
about both wonderful qualities and some less-than-wonderful traits. And yet, 
your friend wouldn’t suddenly give up the friendship because of your imper-
fections. Of course not; nobody’s perfect. If we all gave up on our imperfect 
friends, we would have no friends at all.

211
 Chapter 13: Mindful Acceptance
 
Self-forgiveness is difficult. Perhaps even more difficult is finding out how to 
drop defensive barriers in response to criticism from others. Figure out how 
to listen to criticism. Consider the fact that it may at least have an element of 
truth. Appreciate that portion of truth.
Try acknowledging any sliver of truth that criticism contains. Perhaps it’s 
true sometimes. Perhaps the criticism is partially applicable. Instead of put-
ting up barriers to communication and problem solving, admitting to some 
flaws brings people closer.
Table 13-1

Jack is one of the funniest guys I know.
Sometimes Jack talks too much.
He’s always there for me.
Even though he’s smart, sometimes 
Jack makes stupid decisions, espe-
cially about money.
Jack will help me anytime I need it, no 
matter what.
Jack’s a little overweight, and some-
times he drinks a little too much.
I like going to sporting events with him.
He doesn’t always listen to me.
I like the fact that Jack is really smart. 
Jack has terrible taste in clothes.
Connecting with the Here and Now
In some ways, language represents the peak of evolutionary development. 
Language makes us human, gives us art, allows us to express complex ideas, 
and provides us with the tools for creating solutions to problems. At the 
same time, language lays the foundation for much of our emotional distress. 
How can that be?
You may think that dogs don’t get anxious, but they do. However, they only 
feel anxiety when they’re in direct contact with experiences that cause them 
pain or discomfort. For example, dogs rarely enjoy going to the vet. More 
than a few dog owners have had to drag their dogs through the veterinarian’s 
door by pulling on the leash with all their might.
However, humans do what dogs would never do. Humans wake up dreading 
the events of the day that lies ahead. Dogs don’t wake up at 3 a.m. and think, 
“Oh no! Is today the day that I have to go to the vet? What will happen to me 
there?”

212
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
And dogs have few regrets. Oh sure, sometimes dogs look pretty guilty when 
caught chewing on their master’s shoe. But one kind word and a pat on the 
head, and they’ve forgotten all about it. Some anxious people still remember 
the thank-you note that they forgot to write to Aunt Betty six years ago.
Generally speaking, dogs seem much happier than most of us humans. Unless 
a dog has been horribly abused, he usually carries on with contentment, joy, 
and, of course, quite a bit of sleeping. By contrast, humans worry a lot; they 
obsess over imagined horrors down the road, and they dwell on their past 
mistakes.
When you bring possible future catastrophes as well as past regrets into 
the present, you’re essentially using language to disconnect you from real-
life experience. Doing so can absolutely ruin your present moments — the 
time that you actually live your entire life! Consider the following example 
of Reggie, who dreaded the amount of work that he believed he had to finish 
within five days.
Reggie, a criminal defense attorney, has a solo practice. An important 
trial is coming up in five days. The amount of work in front of him almost 
chokes him with fear. Of course, he agonizes over the possibility of put-
ting on a less-than-stellar performance, but most of all, he is concerned 
about the heavy preparation of papers, briefs, depositions, and petitions 
that must be completed, and soon. He knows that he’ll be working from 
dawn to dusk with barely enough time to breathe.
The funny thing about it, though, is that after the ordeal was over, he 
realized that most of those five days turned out to be fairly enjoyable. He 
worried over the possibility of not completing his tasks, which had noth-
ing to do with any of the actual work that he performed. Most of that felt 
pretty good. Not a single, individual moment felt horrible by itself.
 
Few present moments truly feel unbearable. It’s simply our ability to ruin the 
present with thoughts about the future or past that disturbs us.
 
The next time you obsess over future or past events, tasks, or outcomes, con-
sider trying the following:
 
✓ Stay focused on each moment as it comes to you.
 
✓ Spend a few minutes noticing all the sensations in your body at the 
moment — touch, smell, sights, and sounds.
 
✓ When thoughts about the tasks ahead enter your mind, simply acknowl-
edge the presence of those thoughts and move your attention back to 
the present.
 
✓ If thoughts about past failures or regrets enter your mind, notice the pres-
ence of those thoughts and move your attention back to the present.
 
✓ Remind yourself that thoughts don’t reflect reality and experience; 
they’re only thoughts.

213
 Chapter 13: Mindful Acceptance
 
✓ When you notice disturbing thoughts about the future or the past, try 
just observing them, notice how interesting it is that your mind spins 
out thoughts like these, and return to the present moment.
The following sections contain specific exercises you can use to keep your 
mind focused on the present moment. We also offer some pointers on how to 
slow down and enjoy mealtimes and walks.
Making contact with the present
At this very moment, consider coming into direct contact with experience. 
This is something many people have rarely done. Have no expectations about 
what this exercise is supposed to do. Just study what happens.
 
If judgments enter your mind as you’re doing the following exercise, observe 
how your mind spins these out like a reflex. Make no judgments about these 
thoughts or yourself. Go back to focusing on the entire array of present-
moment sensations.
 
1. Notice how this book feels in your hands.
 
 Feel the smooth cover and the edges of the pages. Or feel the buttons 
and surface of your e-book reader!
 
2. Notice how your body feels and notice your position, whether you’re 
sitting, standing in a subway, riding a bus, or lying in bed.
 
 Feel the sensations in your skin as it makes contact with the chair, the 
bed, the floor if you’re standing, and so on.
 
3. Feel the muscles in your legs, back, hands, and arms as you hold this 
book.
 
4. Notice your breathing.
 
 Feel the air go in and out of your nostrils.
 
5. Notice any smells, whether pleasant or unpleasant.
 
 Think about how you could write a report about these smells.
 
6. Listen to any sounds around you. Imagine how you would describe 
these sounds to a friend.
 
 If you hear loud, obnoxious sounds, try not to judge them. Instead of 
thinking about how jarring they sound, study the nuances in the sounds.
Now, notice how you feel at the end of this exercise. Did you experience the 
sensations fully? What happened to your anxiety? Many people report that 
they feel little, if any, anxiety during this experience. Others say their anxiety 
escalates.

214
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
If your anxiety increases during your first few attempts to connect with 
present-moment experience, don’t worry. It happens for various reasons. 
Increased anxiety doesn’t mean that you’re doing something wrong. More 
than likely, it can be attributed to one or more of the following:
 
✓ You may have little experience connecting to the present. Therefore, it 
feels strange.
 
✓ Anxious thoughts may interrupt you frequently. If so, more practice may 
help to reduce their potency.
 
✓ You may be facing such an overwhelming stressor right now that putting 
this strategy into effect is unrealistic. If so, you may want to try other 
strategies in the book first.
Whatever the case, we recommend practicing frequent connection with 
present-moment experiences.
 
Most anxiety and distress come from thoughts about the future or the past, 
not what’s happening at this moment.
Putting worries about the future to rest
Most people tell us that at least 90 percent of what they worry about never 
happens. Of those worrisome events that do occur, less than 10 percent are 
as bad as they anticipated. That’s an overabundance of worry and ruined 
present moments just to anticipate a few unpleasant occurrences.
 
Here’s a way you can quit listening to that occasional stream of worries about 
future events.
 
1. Think about how many times you’ve made negative forecasts in the 
past about some pending event.
 
2. Then ask yourself how often those forecasts have proven true.
 
 If you’re not sure, keep a log of your negative predictions and see what 
percentage pans out.
 
3. Of those forecasts that do come true, how often is it as bad as you 
anticipated?
 
 If you’re not sure how often, keep a log for a while.
Taking these predictions seriously is rather like listening to a weather 
reporter on the television who tells you that blizzards, severe cold, and 
ice storms are forecasted for every day. So you dutifully don a heavy coat, 
gloves, and boots. Just one problem nags you, however. Ninety percent of 
the time, the reporter is absolutely wrong, and the weather is sunny and 
warm. When the reporter gets it almost right, rarely are conditions as bad as 

215
 Chapter 13: Mindful Acceptance
described. Perhaps it’s time to stop listening to the weather reporter in your 
head. You can’t turn the station off, but you can at least take the reports less 
seriously!
Mindfully meditating
Above and beyond reducing anxiety, mindful acceptance can improve the 
quality of your life. When you’re anxious, so much of your mental energy 
focuses on negative sensations, thoughts, and images that you miss many of 
life’s simple pleasures, like eating and taking a leisurely walk.
Mindful eating
How many times have you eaten a meal and barely tasted it? Of course, if it 
tastes like microwaved cardboard, perhaps that’s a good thing. However, 
most of the foods that we eat taste pretty good. What a shame to miss out on 
the full experience.
 
Choose a time to practice mindful eating. Be sure it’s not a ten-minute lunch. 
But it doesn’t require hours, either. Worrisome thoughts may sometimes dis-
tract you. That’s fine and normal. However, try merely noticing them. Rather 
than judge those thoughts or yourself, return your focus to your eating when 
you can. Follow these steps:
 
1. Slow down and focus before taking a bite.
 
2. Look at your food.
 
 Notice how it’s displayed on your plate or bowl. Observe the food’s 
colors, textures, and shapes.
 
3. Take time to smell the aroma.
 
 Put a small portion on your fork or spoon. Before you take a bite, hold it 
briefly under your nose.
 
4. Briefly put the food on your lips and then on the tip of your tongue.
 
5. Put the food in your mouth, but don’t bite down for a moment or two.
 
6. Chew very slowly.
 
 Notice how the taste and texture change with each bite, and how the 
food tastes on different parts of your tongue.
 
7. Swallow the bite and notice how it feels sliding down your throat.
 
8. Follow this procedure throughout your meal.
 
9. Stay seated at the table with your meal for at least 20 minutes.
 
 If you finish eating before the 20 minutes are up, continue sitting until 
the full 20 minutes have elapsed, and notice your surroundings and the 
sensations in your body.

216
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
Consider making mindful eating a regular part of your life. You’ll feel calmer, 
enjoy your food more, and possibly even lose a little weight. Many weight-
loss programs suggest slowing down your eating. However, this approach 
does more — it enables you to fully experience your food. When your mind 
totally focuses on the present pleasure of eating, anxiety fades away.
Mindful walking
Look around at people walking to their various destinations. So often they 
rush about like hamsters on an exercise wheel, not even aware of their sur-
roundings. Rushing people, unlike hamsters, don’t enjoy the exercise — 
instead, their minds fill with anxious anticipations and worries. It’s a small 
wonder that we have an epidemic of high blood pressure these days.
We have an alternative for you to consider: mindful walking. You’ve probably 
tried taking a walk sometime when you felt especially stressed. It probably 
helped. However, mindful walking can help you more.
Practice the following meditation while walking for five minutes, five days in a 
row. Then consider whether you want to make it a regular part of your life.
 
If troubling thoughts intrude, simply notice them. Watch them like clouds 
floating overhead. Don’t judge them. When you can, bring yourself back to the 
present.
 
Proceed with your walk as follows:
 
1. Pause before you start.
 
2. Notice the feeling of air going in and out of your nose and lungs. 
Breathe quietly for five breaths.
 
3. Begin walking.
 
4. Notice the sensations in your leg muscles — your ankles, calves, and 
thighs.
 
 Spend a minute or two focusing only on these muscles and how they 
feel.
 
5. Now, feel the bottom of your feet as they strike the ground.
 
 Try to notice how the heel hits first, then the foot rolls, and then you 
push off with the ball of your foot and toes. Concentrate on the bottom 
of your feet for a minute or two.
 
6. Now, focus on the rhythm of your walking.
 
 Feel the pace of your legs and the swing of your arms. Stay with the 
rhythm for a minute or two and enjoy it.

217
 Chapter 13: Mindful Acceptance
 
7. Feel the air flowing into your nose and lungs. Feel yourself exhaling 
the air. Take notice of the rhythm of your breathing.
 
 Focus on nothing else for a minute or two.
 
8. Continue to take heed of your feet, muscles, rhythm, and breathing, 
shifting your attention from one to the other as you like.
Enthusiasts extol the virtues of mindful walking. They claim it helps them 
reduce stress and become more serene. You can experiment with mindful 
walking in various ways. For example, try focusing on sights and sounds or 
focus on smells as you encounter them. Play with this strategy and develop 
your own approach. There’s no right or wrong way to be mindful.
Accepting Mindfulness into Your Life
Some people read about mindfulness and worry about the time it can con-
sume. They say that it sounds like living life in slow motion and complain that 
nothing would ever get done if they tried living that way. As much as we think 
that living a little slower isn’t a bad idea for many people, mindful acceptance 
doesn’t require significant chunks of time.
More than time, mindfulness entails a shift in philosophy that decreases the 
focus on ego, pride, and control, while emphasizing accepting the present 
with all its gifts and challenges. Being mindful requires humility because it 
acknowledges the uncertainty that’s inherent within life.
 
Making mindful acceptance a habit doesn’t happen overnight. With practice, 
allow it to evolve slowly into your life. Accept that you won’t always stay in 
the present. Don’t judge your attempts to live mindfully. When you see your-
self living in the guilt-ridden past or anxious future, gently remind yourself to 
come back to the present.
Savoring Spirituality
Accepting anxiety involves a variety of related attitudes, such as being non-
judgmental, tolerating uncertainty, letting go of the need for absolute control, 
and being patient. Realize that acceptance isn’t the same as resignation or 
total surrender.

218
Part III: Letting Go of the Battle 
Acceptance means appreciating that you, as well as all humans, have 
strengths and limitations. Many people find that the process of acquiring 
acceptance leads them to a greater sense of spirituality — a feeling that the 
purpose of life transcends one’s own self-concerns. The Serenity Prayer cap-
tures this spirit of acceptance nicely:
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,
the courage to change the things I can;
and the wisdom to know the difference.
Living one day at a time;
enjoying one moment at a time;
accepting hardship as the pathway to peace.
Taking, as He did, this sinful world as it is,
not as I would have it.
Trusting that He will make all things right
if I surrender to His Will;
that I may be reasonably happy in this life,
and supremely happy with Him forever in the next.
— Reinhold Niebuhr, 1926

n this edition, we bring you a new section devoted to 
many of the concerns that have emerged as major wor-
ries in the modern world. We tell you how to deal with 
career and financial stresses and show you how to pre-
pare for and deal with natural calamities ranging from tsu-
namis to earthquakes and fires.
We review the growing problem of worldwide pandemics 
and show you how to inventory your own personal health 
risks and design a plan for maximizing your long-term 
health.
Finally, we show you how to evaluate risks associated 
with all types of violence, such as crime, terrorism, and 
accidents. More important, we discuss how to avoid 
unnecessary risks as well as how to deal with them in the 
event that they happen to you.

P
eople worry about money — a lot. They obsess over their 401(k) 
accounts, savings, salaries, home values, and promotions. More basic 
needs underlie these concerns — worries about job loss, foreclosures, and 
the ability to meet essential life needs such as food, clothing, healthcare, and 
shelter. Although people are generally more important than money, everyone 
needs a certain amount of income for survival.
In this chapter, we tackle money concerns head-on. We do so with a keen 
awareness of the seriousness of financial worries. In other words, we don’t 
take a glib, don’t worry, be happy approach to these issues. And we don’t 
claim to be financial experts; after all, we’re psychologists. So this chapter is 
not a prescription for getting rich fast and retiring early. It’s a guide to what 
steps you can take to better handle your anxiety and worry over your career 
and financial challenges.
First, we take a hard-nosed look at job worries. Then we help you make a real-
istic appraisal of what you have and don’t have. We also guide you through 
an exercise that explores your true needs as separate from your mere desires 
and wishes. Finally, we ask you to commit to a new, long-term financial strat-
egy designed to minimize your financial worries.
Meeting Job Worries Head-On
If you worry about losing your job, you’re in good company. Like it or not, 
economic recessions occur every so many years and often result in millions 
of people losing their jobs. And one can ever know for certain which careers 

222
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
will become the most vulnerable in the next recession. Thus, at one time, 
working for a major car manufacturer was seen as one of the most secure 
jobs you could have. Technology has produced huge numbers of jobs in 
some areas while wiping out or depleting opportunities for many jobs such 
as travel agents, telephone operators, and bank tellers.
As we write this book, about 1 out of 10 Americans have lost their jobs, and 
many more are grossly underemployed. For most of those who’ve held on to 
jobs, salary increases have stalled, and opportunities for advancement have 
vanished, at least for the short run. If you’re faced with possible job loss, 
anxiety is a perfectly understandable emotion. Of course you worry! This sec-
tion gives you a few tools for dealing with these worries.
Shoring up your resume
One way to decrease your worries about jobs is to maximize your market-
ability. Even if you’re currently working, it’s a good idea to have a world-class 
resume. Various Web sites and search engines like Google contain sample 
resumes and tips for writing them. Or consider reading Resumes For Dummies 
by Joyce Kennedy (Wiley). If you’re out of work, check the book out from 
your local library.
Keeping your resume up-to-date sounds simple, right? But it’s not necessar-
ily so. Many people find resume-writing highly anxiety-arousing. And when 
people have anxiety, they tend to avoid what makes them anxious. So, if 
you’re like many people, you may find yourself procrastinating or avoiding 
the task.
 
We have some suggestions:
 
✓ Get help. If you’ve lost your job, state unemployment offices and local 
community colleges offer training on writing resumes. You can also find 
sample resumes on the Internet, at the library, or at a bookstore.
 
✓ Break the task into small steps. For example, vow to write out your edu-
cational background during the first session. The next day, write out 
your job descriptions.
 
✓ Show your resume to a few friends or colleagues for feedback. Or, if 
you’re working with an employment agency, someone there can likely 
give you pointers.
 
✓ Know that avoiding this task will likely increase your anxiety rather than 
make you feel better. The only way to get through that anxiety is to face 
your fear by going right at it and tackling the task in spite of your anxiety.

223
 Chapter 14: Facing a Career Crisis and Financial Woes
 
Employers often spend no more than ten seconds reviewing each individual 
resume. Make sure yours is short, visually appealing, and highlights your best 
strengths. You can’t afford to have any misspellings or grammatical errors. 
Use quality paper.
 
If your resume review reveals a lack of skills, you may want to consider acquir-
ing new skills, either on your own or through a local training facility, commu-
nity college, or university. See the “Considering careers with stability” section 
later in the chapter for fields that generally offer steady employment.
Finding flexibility in your career view
Whether you lose a job because of layoffs, can’t find a job in your own field, 
or simply choose to leave a job, a psychological trait known as flexibility can 
improve your ability to handle the challenge of change. Flexible people adapt 
to new situations. When stuck, they look for alternatives. They take action to 
improve their situation.
So why is flexibility so important for handling job worries? According to the 
U.S. Department of Labor, an average worker holds 10.8 jobs between the 
ages of 18 and 42. Obviously, there’s a wide range — some people never 
have more than 1 or 2 jobs and others have 20. The message is that very 
few people stay with one company for a lifetime of work. In addition, many 
people switch careers — some by choice (like after obtaining additional 
training) and others by accident (such as losing a job in one field and taking a 
job in another field).
Inflexible people often become angry when faced with job frustrations. 
Instead of acting, they react with anger at how unfair life has been for them. 
Inflexible people stick to old choices, don’t take advantage of new opportuni-
ties, and seem stubborn and stuck.
To improve physical flexibility, you start with small stretches and gradually 
bend more. If a move is painful, you back down. You try to achieve balance 
by stretching both the right and left sides of your body. Gradually, your flex-
ibility improves.
 
Mental flexibility involves the same principles — gradual steps, balance, and 
backing off when painful. Mental flexibility involves being able to see reality 
from different perspectives. For example, in a job interview, a person with 
mental flexibility would try to put himself in the shoes of the person doing the 
interview. Or in negotiations, a flexible person would take the time to consider 
the perspectives of all involved.

224
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
Mental flexibility accepts change as inevitable and expected. Such flexibility 
requires openness to new experiences and the understanding that most of 
the time, truth is unknowable. Finally, flexible people understand that in 
order to learn, they must listen.
Armed with a more flexible attitude, you can handle the stress and anxiety of 
job loss and other changes by considering all your options and alternatives. 
This attitude may enable you to see possibilities you wouldn’t see otherwise. 
And your efforts will more likely result in success.
 
When writing your resume (see the preceding section), use flexible thinking. 
Look at your past jobs and consider what skills, attributes, and characteristics 
you brought to the table above and beyond those that are obvious from your 
job titles — highlight these skills on your resume. And when you interview, 
mention the connection between the skills you’ve acquired and how you can 
use them to advantage in your new company, instead of focusing on the past.
Considering careers with stability
You’ll worry less if your career path stands on a concrete foundation rather 
than one made of sand. If you’re underemployed or unemployed, consider 
updating your skills or changing your career path to one that has more stabil-
ity. Get more training and education. If figuring out how to pay for classes is 
a concern, most postsecondary schools have student loans, grants, or other 
ways to help pay for their programs.
 
It’s never too late to go back to school. Consider taking one class at a time. 
Also look into online courses from accredited schools. These classes can be 
especially convenient for some people.
Think about how many years you have left to work. Wouldn’t you prefer to 
be doing something you like? Here are a few areas considered to be relatively 
stable in these unstable times:
 
✓ Healthcare: Almost all areas of healthcare will see growth over the next 
few decades. In addition to professionals like nurses, doctors, pharma-
cists, physical therapists, and dentists, others, such as home healthcare 
workers, medical technologists, and healthcare case managers, will be in 
greater demand.
 
✓ Education: As the baby boomers retire from teaching, the education 
system will see many openings. Areas of need continue to exist in math, 
science, and bilingual education. College instructors and professors will 
also be needed in greater numbers.

225
 Chapter 14: Facing a Career Crisis and Financial Woes
 
✓ Law enforcement and security: Needs for police officers, correction 
officers, and security personnel are likely to increase in years to come. 
Many of those working in this field are slated for retirement in the 
coming decade or so.
 
✓ Green jobs: Assuming you’ve heard or read a news report in the last few 
years, you know that there has been a cry for increasing energy indepen-
dence and minimizing the harmful impact humans have on the environ-
ment. Thus, this emphasis will call for a vast pool of workers trained 
in areas such as engineering, chemistry, physics, hydrology, and ecol-
ogy, as well as technological expertise in almost every imaginable type 
of alternative energy. These jobs will be available for both those with 
advanced degrees and those with manufacturing and technical skills. 
Many community colleges offer training in these emerging industries.
 
No career path comes with a guarantee of stability. Accept that what’s stable 
at one time could become less so later. Remember, you need to be flexible.
 
Traditionally used by school guidance and vocational counselors, the 
Occupational Outlook Handbook is available for free at www.bls.gov/oco/. 
It contains a comprehensive listing of jobs, educational requirements, job 
conditions, and salaries. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics updates this book 
frequently. Also check out the Dictionary of Occupational Titles available at 
www.occupationalinfo.org for more ideas. Use it to broaden your list of 
possibilities. Again, be flexible!
Keeping the right focus
Anxiety, fear, and dread can easily overwhelm you if you let them. When 
faced with the possibility of job or income loss, people fill their minds with 
images of living on the streets or dying of hunger. Such a scenario is indeed 
awful, and it occasionally happens. But you can do much to prevent this out-
come, and it occurs a very small fraction of the time compared to the amount 
of time that people spend dwelling on this worry.
If you worry about losing your job or you find yourself unemployed, you have 
a new job. That new job is to cut your expenses to the bone (we give you 
some guidance on making these cuts in the “Tallying up your financial bal-
ance sheet” section later in the chapter). Cutting expenses helps you even if 
you haven’t yet lost your job, because it helps you hold out longer if you do 
lose your income. After you’ve reduced the amount of money you’re spend-
ing, your next step is to maximize your ability to find a new job (more on that 
in the “Knowing your personal assets and liabilities” section).

226
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
Other strategies, such as applying for unemployment, getting help from fami-
lies, and applying for food stamps, should all be considered. But go to your 
state unemployment office for the nuts and bolts of that kind of advice. From 
a psychological perspective, we suggest the following:
 
✓ Focus on the present, taking one day at a time.
 
✓ Take care of your physical body by eating right and exercising to help 
your mind.
 
✓ Stay connected with friends and family — support helps!
 
✓ Consider going to a support group for job seekers — find one through 
the Internet or your local newspaper.
 
✓ Realize that negative predictions and worrying about possible future 
calamities never prevented a single catastrophe.
Taking Stock of Your Resources
Personal resources include financial and psychological assets and liabilities. 
Assets are the money or skills that you have that are of great value; liabilities 
are the money you owe or the skills that you need to gain. Both play a critical 
role in your adjustment to setbacks and stress. The following sections outline 
some of the things that can help maximize your assets and minimize your 
liabilities.
Tallying up your financial balance sheet
Most lenders such as mortgage companies, banks, or car dealers require 
customers to fill out loan applications. A standard loan application includes 
a description of the purpose of the loan and information about the borrow-
ers. The application often asks about money coming in each month as well as 
monthly expenses. Applicants are also asked to list all their assets and liabili-
ties. A net worth is calculated by subtracting the liabilities from the assets.
You don’t have to apply for a loan to organize your assets. We suggest that 
you review your income, expenses, assets, and liabilities whether or not you 
want to borrow money. That way you can see just what you have now. Make 
a list for each of the four categories; the result is called your balance sheet.
 
When you think about your assets, include everything — grandma’s silver, 
coin collections, and other prized possessions. You may not want to sell them, 
but you always know you could if things got really bad.

227
 Chapter 14: Facing a Career Crisis and Financial Woes
After you know your income, expenses, assets, and liabilities, take a moment 
to think about them. Can you find ways to improve your balance sheet? We 
suggest that you carefully review your expenses. All too often, people make 
the mistake of assuming they need far more than they really do. Ponder the 
answer to these questions:
 
✓ How could I entertain myself without 150 TV stations?
 
✓ How many outfits do I really wear regularly, and how few could I get 
by on?
 
✓ Can I cut out unnecessary coffee, lunches, and dinners out?
 
✓ Could I look just fine in clothes from a thrift store?
 
✓ How can I cut my use of the car by walking, biking, or using public trans-
portation?
 
✓ How much could I save by checking books out of the library instead of 
purchasing them?
 
✓ How can I cut my energy use and save money?
 
✓ Can I stop spending money to impress other people?
Multiple research studies have found what most people have trouble believ-
ing: Your income has a very small relationship to how happy you are. Many 
people find that once they start cutting expenses, they’re amazed at how 
much they can save without sacrificing their emotional well-being. In fact, 
they often report feeling less stressed. Some even say that the saving process 
feels like fun when they get going.
Knowing your personal assets 
and liabilities
Although you want to assess your financial strengths first when facing the 
possibility of a job loss, it’s also helpful to analyze your personal strengths 
and attributes. Start by asking yourself the following questions:
 
✓ Am I willing to learn new skills?
 
✓ Do I get along well with other people?
 
✓ Am I persistent?
 
✓ Do I get to work on time?
 
✓ Do I finish projects on time?

228
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
 
✓ Do I accept feedback and criticism without becoming defensive?
 
✓ Am I a good team player?
 
✓ Do I refrain from unnecessary gossiping?
 
✓ Do I keep my personal life separate from my professional life?
 
✓ Am I self-motivated?
 
✓ Am I good at keeping my cool under stress?
 
✓ Am I creative, and can I think outside the box?
In an interview, be prepared to talk about any of the preceding questions that 
you feel you can answer affirmatively; these represent your assets. Any of the 
questions that you feel don’t apply to you may represent areas for personal 
development. Look for ways to improve in those areas to turn your liabilities 
into assets.
 
After writing out your answers to the preceding list of questions, write down 
as many of your personal strengths as you can think of. Consider including 
examples from previous jobs that illustrate these strengths. Then list your 
weaker areas. The result gives you a sense of your job-related, psychological 
net worth.
Committing to a New Game Plan
You can reduce the amount of energy you spend worrying about jobs and 
money if you commit yourself to making some changes. In addition to the 
ideas in the previous sections, we suggest you develop a game plan for your 
money and your career. We recommend that you consider both short- and 
long-term goals. Earlier sections prepare you for what’s next — where the 
rubber meets the road.
Setting short-term goals
You’ll never get where you want to go unless you have a map. Lots of people 
go through their entire lives without ever thinking about what they want to 
accomplish. Look at your money and career, and ponder what you really 
want to achieve in the next couple of years.

229
 Chapter 14: Facing a Career Crisis and Financial Woes
Considering short-term career goals
Take a vocational interest inventory at your local community college. Write 
down the job skills that you already possess. Brainstorm job possibilities 
that can make use of your personal strengths and interests. Make a list of 
these job possibilities and, assuming you’ve updated your resume, prepare 
to market yourself.
 
Prior to putting in applications, we recommend that you practice interviewing 
with your friends or a vocational counselor or therapist. Practice until your 
anxiety comes down — and it will if you practice enough.
When you’ve got a polished resume and you’re ready to face an interviewer, 
you need to find a job. Don’t just rely on sending out resumes to jobs listed in 
your local paper or on the Internet. In addition to those sources, consider
 
✓ Looking in the phone book for companies that you can imagine putting 
your skills to use. Making cold calls can be surprisingly effective.
 
✓ Calling people you used to work or go to school with — in other words, 
networking.
 
✓ Asking family and friends — more networking.
 
✓ Looking at jobs working for the government.
 
✓ Working for a temporary agency — these jobs often become permanent.
Getting your money plans started
Money flows like water. If you stop spending it in one area, it flows around 
that area just to be spent somewhere else. The only way to save it is to chan-
nel your money carefully into a reservoir or holding tank. Yes, we’re talking 
about saving.
Because this isn’t an investment book, we’re not going to suggest specific 
types of investments. Rather, the purpose of this book is to help you under-
stand and deal with anxiety. So if you’re anxious about money, you’ll have 
less anxiety if you have more money saved. And it doesn’t matter much 
where you put it — money adds up even in a savings account with zero per-
cent interest.
So start now. Begin with what you have and build slowly. Continually 
increase your contributions to your savings as soon as you can. You may just 
surprise yourself.

230
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
Planning for the long haul
Not too many years ago, people worked for the same company for a lifetime 
and looked forward to a retirement of fishing and golf. More often than not, 
nowadays that dream is just that — a dream that won’t ever find fulfillment, 
at least as it was originally envisioned. Many jobs have evaporated, a surpris-
ing number of pension plans have gone belly up, and many IRA and 401(k) 
types of accounts have shriveled.
Is this state of affairs a cause for despair and hopelessness? We don’t think 
so. Sure, you’re right to feel concerned and maybe even disappointed that 
you may not be able to retire when you want or live the retirement lifestyle 
that you once expected. But the trait of flexibility we talk about earlier in this 
chapter applies here too. You should know that research reported in the 
Journal of Occupational Health Psychology in 2009 actually found that people 
who work part time instead of completely retiring are healthier both physi-
cally and mentally. This finding held up even when controlling for variables 
like age, education, and wealth.
So consider that the goal of complete retirement may not even be especially 
good for you! You don’t have to make as much as you did prior to semi-
retiring or work as many hours. That’s because part-time work can go a long 
way toward stretching whatever retirement account dollars you already 
have. Consider looking for an encore career that gives you more satisfaction 
and meaning than just money. Or try something brand new that comes with 
less stress but connects you with people. It’s a whole lot easier to go to work 
if you’re having fun. At this time in your life, your job doesn’t need to build 
your ego or impress other people.
Finally, try to realize that a certain amount of uncertainty is certain! In other 
words, life and investments will always take unexpected twists and turns. 
You can’t avoid setbacks, but you can recover. In the long haul, markets, 
economies, and people inevitably rise and fall.

▶ Looking at the true statistics
▶ Evaluating risk realistically
▶ Managing risks
▶ Coping constructively
P
erhaps you think that you’re a rational person. If so, you probably 
believe that the fears that make you the most anxious are the things 
that pose the greatest risk to you — after all, that would be the most rational 
perspective, wouldn’t it? But that’s not how the mind works. People focus 
and dwell on worries that grab their attention, not those that are most likely 
to happen.
News media, inadvertently or otherwise, often exacerbate the problem. When 
natural disasters hit, news helicopters take off like a flock of geese startled 
by a shotgun blast. Television screens fill with images of horror, pain, suffer-
ing, and death. Reporters seemingly thrive on interviews with grief-stricken 
victims and run their tales of woe repeatedly for days at a time. No wonder 
many people spend lots of time worrying about natural disasters.
On the other hand, perhaps you have a variety of anxieties and worries, but 
natural disasters aren’t something that bother you. If so, you can feel free to 
skip this chapter — unless you’re just curious about the subject.
In this chapter, we help you sort through such fears and worries. We help 
you see that you may be spending lots of time on issues of low risk and/
or things you really can’t do anything about. We also discuss how to look 
at your personal risks. Sometimes, worrying about natural disasters is real-
istic if you live in certain high-risk areas. In those cases, we suggest ways 
to manage such risks from a practical as well as emotional standpoint. We 
conclude with ideas about what you can do to cope actively rather than pas-
sively by working to improve the world and the lives of others when they 
encounter natural disasters.

232
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
Assessing Your Risks
Because images of natural disasters vividly stream from television screens 
within minutes of their occurrence, keeping a realistic perspective on how 
much risk they really pose to you is often difficult. In the next couple of sec-
tions, we briefly review the types of natural disasters in the world and the fre-
quency with which they occur. We also help you understand your true risks 
for encountering a natural disaster.
Looking at the likelihood of dying 
from a natural disaster
You’ve certainly heard the eternal question about when a tree falls in a 
forest — if no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? Natural disasters 
are sort of like that tree. Are calamitous events truly calamitous if no one is 
around when they occur? Maybe not.
However, plenty of disasters hurt people — often in significant numbers — 
when they occur. Disasters can also lead to financial, environmental, and 
emotional distress or loss. The following list represents some of the most 
common natural disasters that people worry about:
 
✓ Avalanches are sudden snow slides that break loose and pummel or 
bury anything in their path. They kill about 150 people per year. Most 
avalanches occur after a winter storm. The risk of dying in an avalanche 
can be put in perspective by knowing that the world population now 
stands at about 6.8 billion and counting.
 
✓ Earthquakes occur thousands of times every day. The vast majority of 
these quakes are minor and unnoticeable on the earth’s surface. From 
time to time, however, earthquakes unleash a powerful explosion of 
pent-up energy sending huge, destructive seismic waves across a broad 
area. On average, about 10,000 people die in earthquakes each year. 
Most die in collapsed buildings, but earthquake-triggered landslides, 
fires, and floods also claim lives.
 
✓ Fires, whether in forests, houses, or buildings, kill more people than 
most natural disasters. The U.S. Fire Administration claims that the 
United States’ rate of fire deaths is among the highest in the industrial-
ized world. Nonetheless, the risk of dying from fire in the United States 
is somewhere around 15 in one million.
 
✓ Floods occur when large volumes of water submerge land, houses, build-
ings, and people. They often result from extreme weather such as hurri-
canes or torrential downpours. Floods also occur when dams and other 
barriers break. The overall risk of dying from floods has declined due 
to improved warning systems and knowledge about where they’re likely 

233
 Chapter 15: Keeping Steady When the World Is Shaking
to occur. According to the Civil Society Coalition on Climate Change, 
your overall risk of dying from floods stands at around one in a million 
each year. However, floods sometimes kill more than 100,000 people in a 
single incident. And many more people lose their possessions and prop-
erty to floods.
 
✓ Hurricanes emerge from some tropical storms and generate wind 
speeds of 75 to over 150 miles an hour. Most of those who die from hur-
ricanes die from flooding (see the preceding item in this list).
Have we got you worried? Consider that this list pales in comparison to all 
the possible natural disasters. Perhaps you can’t readily think of other disas-
ters, but Wikipedia lists these (among others!):
 
✓ Asteroids
 
✓ Blizzards & extreme cold
 
✓ Falling junk from outer space
 
✓ Gamma ray bursts (massive electromagnetic explosions in galaxies that 
have even been speculated as having the potential to someday cause 
mass extinctions on earth!)
 
✓ Hailstorms
 
✓ Heat waves
 
✓ Lightning
 
✓ Limnic eruptions (a huge eruption of carbon dioxide from deep lakes 
that can suffocate livestock and people in the area)
 
✓ Tornados
 
✓ Tsunamis
 
✓ Volcanic eruptions
You get the idea. Possibilities abound. But your overall risk of death from 
any particular natural disaster is far lower than death by your own hand or 
accidental death — both of which most people worry much less about than 
natural disasters. On the other hand, your risk of death from natural disas-
ters may be far greater than most people’s. We tell you how to determine that 
risk next.
Tabulating your personal risks
The lists in the preceding section include the most common natural disasters 
(and obviously a number that aren’t so common). But you probably don’t 
have to worry too much about them happening to you unless you live in an 
area plagued by them. However, you never know when something may erupt. 

234
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
So make a list of your personal risk factors. Do you live, work, travel, or play 
in areas that may be subject to a natural disaster?
For example, people who live in certain areas of California choose the won-
derful weather over the risk of living in earthquake, fire, and mudslide risk 
zones. And if you go helicopter skiing frequently, you darn well better know 
about what triggers avalanches. So a given individual may have a much 
greater risk of being harmed or killed by natural disasters than the average 
person. If that risk applies to you, you want to take extra precautions.
 
If you don’t know your risks, try using a search engine on the Internet to find 
out. After all, you don’t want to live in denial anymore than you want to obsess 
about risks that are greater in your mind than in reality.
For example, we live in landlocked New Mexico and usually don’t even think 
about natural disasters. Every once in a while, a weather system in the Pacific 
causes it to rain like crazy here, and we get a few flooded streets and arroyos 
(you might call them drainage ditches). In some areas of the state, forest fires 
present some risk. In addition, if you look out our home’s window, you can 
see some dusty old volcanoes that were active about 3,000 years ago. We 
don’t worry too much about those either.
But just to make sure, we entered “New Mexico and volcanoes” into our 
browser, and, much to our surprise, we found out that our state is known as 
the “volcano state.” Furthermore, we sit on a large continental rift and live on 
top of large veins of hot lava. The time frame listed for another eruption was 
listed as “geologically soon.” Oh no! What should we do? Read on.
Preparing a Plan for Realistic Worries
You can never prepare for every imaginable crisis. Rather, it’s important to 
assess which risks have a realistic chance of happening. Then prepare for 
those in proportion to the risks they pose, as best you can.
 
Probably the most important piece of advice we can give you is this: During 
times of crisis, listen to public service announcements and directives — and 
follow them. In addition, we suggest you ponder the following questions in 
advance of any calamity:
 
✓ Have I become educated about the specific risks in my area?
 
✓ If I live in a place in which natural disasters occur, have I made reason-
able preparations?
 
✓ Do I know the emergency evacuation route for my area?
 
✓ If a disaster appears imminent, do I have a full tank of gas?

235
 Chapter 15: Keeping Steady When the World Is Shaking
 
✓ Do I have supplies on hand, such as flashlights, warm clothing, extra 
batteries, at least a three-day stockpile of food and water, and a battery-
powered radio?
 
✓ Do I have a first-aid kit?
 
✓ Do I have a plan if an emergency occurs?
 
✓ Do I have an emergency stash of cash?
 
✓ Do I have my important documents saved in a safety deposit box or fire-
proof safe?
 
✓ Do I know how to use a fire extinguisher, and do I have a fully charged 
extinguisher?
 
✓ Do I know how to shut off utilities in the event of a disaster?
 
✓ Do I know what I would take with me in case I need to evacuate?
 
✓ Do I have a plan in place to communicate with my family?
 
✓ Do I have a way to protect my pets?
 
After you’ve gone through the list of questions, take any actions that seem 
necessary and reasonable. Then stop worrying; you’ve done all you can do.
Note the first question on our list is: Have I become educated about the spe-
cific risks in my area? So we searched the Internet to find out what to do in 
case of a volcano eruption. Well, the first idea is to get out of the way. If we 
do happen to be stuck in the house, we should close the doors, windows, 
and block the chimneys to keep ash out. If we go outside to watch, we should 
hold a damp cloth over our mouths to help us breathe. Also, we learned that 
hot lava and ash are heavy and should be brushed off of our roof if much 
lands on it. On the other hand, sometimes volcanoes blow out chunks of lava 
the size of a house, so sweeping it off may be difficult. Dang.
Nevertheless, we’re not planning to spend a whole lot of time on preparing 
for this eventuality, nor do we figure on worrying a lot about it. But after 
writing this chapter, we did realize it wouldn’t be a bad idea to check on the 
state of our fire extinguisher in case any of that lava lands on our backyard or 
house.
 
No matter how well you prepare, you can’t prevent all calamities. Make reason-
able efforts and get on with your life. You can never eliminate all uncertainty 
from life.
Nonetheless, if you find yourself still worrying after having done all you real-
istically should to plan for disasters, read the next section.

Finding the silver lining in adversity
Unexpected things happen even if you take 
precautions. The following account of a couple 
on a honeymoon illustrates an unexpected 
encounter with a natural disaster.
 
 Sandy and Brice leave for their tropical 
honeymoon in November, carefully avoid-
ing the peak of hurricane season. The 
newlyweds are exhausted from the wed-
ding and look forward to a relaxing beach 
vacation. As promised, the resort is beauti-
ful and the beaches pristine. After the first 
day of lounging on the beach, they return to 
their room. They’re surprised to see a note 
lying on their bed.
 
 “The management regrets to inform you 
that there will be a severe tropical storm in 
the area. Please be advised that you will be 
required to evacuate by bus to a safe area. 
Please bring your belongings, a blanket, 
and a pillow. We will be leaving from the 
lobby of the hotel in two hours.”
 
 The buses take about 50 guests and hotel 
staff to a shabby school about 30 minutes 
away. The humidity is high and the school 
smells like mold. The staff tells the guests 
that the air conditioning in the school 
doesn’t work very well, but they will try to 
keep everyone comfortable. Cots are set up 
in a large room that serves as a cafeteria 
and gymnasium.
 
 Sandy and Brice try to keep a positive atti-
tude, and the hotel staff seems very well 
organized. The first meal consists of a cold 
chicken salad, salsa, and chips. The hotel 
provides cans of beer and soda. A few of 
the quests start singing campfire songs, 
and the group remains festive. However, 
after a few hours, the rain picks up. Then 
the electricity goes off. The mood of the 
refugees grows darker with the darkening 
sky. Hours pass and the sounds of wind, 
rain, and thunder are interrupted by loud 
crashes. People huddle together; some 
cry; others pray. A few exhausted children 
sleep.
 
 By morning, the intensity of the storm less-
ens. But the people are told that it’s not yet 
safe to return to the beach area and that 
the airports are closed. Brice tells a staff 
member that he must get in touch with 
his family. The staff member tells him that 
communication is impossible. They serve 
cold hard rolls and canned juice for break-
fast. Staff inform them that water is getting 
scarce and that they must ration it. As the 
day wears on, anger and irritability rise. 
Some people get sick. The smell gets worse 
and worse. The third and fourth days pose 
almost unbearable challenges from the lack 
of electricity, food, water, and sanitary con-
ditions.
 
 Finally, the buses come back and the tour-
ists are returned to a devastated hotel. 
Windows are shattered and the halls are 
flooded. Sandy and Brice can barely walk, 
having suffered from food poisoning. Yet 
they feel lucky to be alive.
Sandy and Brice realize that even when you try 
your best to avoid risks, bad things happen. In 
looking back, they believe they gained maturity 
and closeness from the adversity. Their new 
marriage flourishes. And they face the coming 
years with greater acceptance of uncertainty 
and appreciation for every day of their lives.

Imagining and Dealing with the Worst
Hopefully, you’ve looked at how realistic your worries about natural disas-
ters are, and you’ve done what you can do to plan. Nevertheless, you may 
find yourself worrying more than you’d like to.
Our first recommendation is to carefully read Chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8 to under-
stand how your thoughts and the words you use influence your anxiety. Then 
you can apply that information to your worries about natural disasters. The 
following sections show you how to make that application to this issue.
 
If you or someone you care about does experience a natural disaster, you’ll 
probably feel increased anxiety and distress. If your distress is mild, Chapters 
5, 6, 7, and 8 may help you deal with it. If distress is severe and continues, 
please consider seeing a mental-health professional.
Rethinking uncertainty and anxiety
The anxious mind tries in vain to eliminate all uncertainty from life. 
Unfortunately, living a life without a reasonable degree of uncertainty would 
result in more misery than you think. Consider the following list of risks, 
many of which you probably take every day. Imagine trying to live life with-
out any of these risks at all.
 
✓ Leaving your house
 
✓ Driving your car
 
✓ Breathing without a mask (unless a pandemic is active)
 
✓ Not decontaminating every single surface you contact
 
✓ Eating food that hasn’t been boiled
 
✓ Opening your mail (it could have anthrax in it)
 
✓ Going shopping
 
✓ Walking across a street
 
✓ Riding a bike
 
✓ Taking a shower (poses a significant risk of falls)
Of course, we realize that if you suffer from significant anxiety, you prob-
ably do try to avoid at least a few of these risks. But you’re taking many such 
chances regularly. Even if you wear latex gloves every day, you can’t prevent 
contact with all germs, natural disasters, or accidents.

238
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
 
Even though you may think otherwise, acceptance of risk and uncertainty para-
doxically helps anxiety abate. See Chapter 13 for more about accepting anxiety.
Rethinking your ability to cope
Most people with anxiety disorders gravely underestimate their ability to 
cope in the face of unexpected challenges. They see themselves as easily 
overwhelmed and lacking either the will, skills, or resources to deal with 
adversity. For example, they say to themselves, “I couldn’t stand that,” “I 
can’t take it,” or “I’d fall apart if that happened to me!” Yet when they actually 
encounter what they fear, inevitably, they do cope.
 
In Chapter 5, we provide a list of five questions for helping you deal with some 
pretty difficult worst-case scenarios. We suggest answering these questions 
for your fears of natural disasters. First, we show you the questions, and then 
we illustrate their use with an example.
 
✓ Have I ever dealt with anything like this in the past?
 
✓ How much will this affect my life a year from now?
 
✓ Do I know people who’ve coped with something like this, and how did 
they do it?
 
✓ Do I know anyone I could turn to for help or support?
 
✓ Can I think of a creative new possibility that could result from this 
challenge?
In the next example, a resident of Southern California attempts to answer the 
coping questions to help her deal with her fear of earthquakes.
Lynne moves from London to San Diego to take an academic position 
at the University of California. She loves her new job and the sunshine. 
Lynne rents a small apartment within biking distance of her office. One 
day as she walks across campus, she’s surprised by a sudden feeling of 
unease. She feels like she’s stepping onto an unsteady boat. The sensa-
tion passes quickly. When she arrives at her office, she notices that some 
of the pictures are slightly tilted. She asks a nearby student whether she 
has just experienced her first earthquake. The student laughs and says, 
“Oh, that little sway was just a tremor, nothing like a real earthquake. Just 
wait until you’re in a big one; it’s totally awesome.”
“Awesome? Are you kidding?” Lynne trembles, her heart races, and she 
begins to sweat. She hadn’t considered the reality of earthquakes in 
California. She wonders if she can possibly cope. She recalls having used 
coping questions to deal with her anxiety about moving. Now she returns 
to these questions to help her calm her newly heightened fears about 
earthquakes.

239
 Chapter 15: Keeping Steady When the World Is Shaking
Have I ever dealt with anything like this in the past?
No, I haven’t. I don’t think I can stand this. Maybe I need to quit and go 
back to dreary London.
How much will this affect my life a year from now?
Well, if I live through an earthquake, I guess I may be okay. If I don’t, then 
I’ll be dead.
Do I know people who’ve coped with something like this, and how did 
they do it?
I guess about 36 million or so Californians have lived through a few earth-
quakes and haven’t moved out. They must have accepted the risk and 
learned to live with it.
Do I know anyone I could turn to for help or support?
I can ask people I know about earthquake safety and get more involved in 
the local neighborhood so I meet some of my neighbors.
Can I think of a creative new possibility that could result from this 
challenge?
I realize that lots of people come to the University of California from 
other countries around the world. Maybe I can start a group for new 
residents. We can socialize a bit and have speakers about adjusting to 
America, including earthquake safety. It will be a great way to meet new 
and interesting people and provide a way for me to expose myself to my 
fear.
Lynne learns to accept the risk of earthquakes and the questions help her to 
stop feeling helpless and anxious. See Chapter 5 for examples of how these 
questions can help you ponder and cope even with the possibility of an unex-
pected event that results in death.
Going right at your worries
Exposure — facing your fears gradually over time — is probably the most 
powerful approach to dealing with fear and anxiety (Chapter 8 covers expo-
sure in detail). We suggest applying this technique to your fear of natural 
disasters. Don’t worry — obviously, we’re not going to recommend that you 
actually chase tornadoes or set forest fires and walk into them.
 
When dealing with a fear of natural disasters, the best exposure strategy is 
called imaginal exposure, which includes constructing a staircase of fear and 
imagining the worst-case scenario (see Chapter 8). You can use imaginal expo-
sure as an alternative approach to using the coping strategy questions (see 
the preceding section). Alejandro’s story demonstrates how someone can 
apply imaginal exposure to an intense fear of earthquakes.

240
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
Alejandro lives in San Francisco. He worries about earthquakes. Rightly 
so, because San Francisco sits in a zone that poses a high risk for major 
earthquakes. Alejandro has taken all the usual, appropriate preparations, 
such as knowing how to shut off his utilities, securing water heater tanks, 
maintaining fire extinguishers, knowing evacuation routes, keeping emer-
gency supplies, and such.
Nevertheless, he worries about earthquakes a lot. He jumps whenever 
he hears a rumble of thunder or an unexpected noise. His mind starts to 
dwell on horrible images of death and destruction, and then he quickly 
tries to think about something else.
Because he very much wants to continue living in San Francisco, 
Alejandro decides to see a psychologist. The psychologist suggests using 
imaginal exposure. At first, the strategy sounds to Alejandro like the 
psychologist is recommending that he do more of what’s already scaring 
him — imagining scenes of horror and destruction. But the psychologist 
explains that imaginal exposure is different in a crucial manner. Imaginal 
exposure asks you to break your fears down into steps and gradually con-
front each one in your mind.
He tells Alejandro that he will hold the image of each step in his mind 
until his anxiety reduces by up to 50 percent. They start with the easiest 
step and work up from there. Figure 15-1 shows what his staircase of fear 
looks like:
 
Figure 15-1: 
Alejandro’s 
imaginal 
staircase of 
fear.
 
Imagining being crushed to death by a falling building (99)
Imagining huddling in a doorway as the building sways
wildly and walls start to crumble (90)
Imagining bookcases falling (85)
Imagining dishes crashing from the cabinets (80)
Imagining the pictures falling off the walls (75)
Imagining lying in bed while feeling the ﬂoor start to sway (70)
Watching a movie about earthquakes (60)
Writing a story about an earthquake (55)
Talking to my psychologist about earthquakes (50)
Talking to my psychologist about imaginal exposure (40)
Note that some of Alejandro’s steps occur solely in his imagination, and a few 
involve taking direct actions. By the time Alejandro has worked through his 
staircase of fear, his anxiety about earthquakes bothers him much less than 
it used to.

 Chapter 15: Keeping Steady When the World Is Shaking
Doing Your Part to Improve the World
A number of research studies have shown that when people take charge of 
challenges and do something active, they cope better than if they cope pas-
sively. Passive copers usually do little more than try not to think about what 
worries them — this approach actually makes things worse for them.
On the other hand, active copers look for direct actions they can take to make 
themselves feel empowered. No, you can’t actually do something to prevent 
most natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, and volcanoes, but you 
can influence the environment for the better and/or improve the lives of 
other people who are threatened by disaster. Doing either of these things is 
likely to make you feel less like a helpless victim and more in charge of your 
concerns.
 
If you decide to volunteer to either help the environment or victims of 
disasters (see the next two sections), you may encounter some difficulty or 
disappointment at first. Sometimes, volunteer organizations consist largely 
of people who’ve been with the organization a long time and who may not 
immediately welcome new members. It may take some time to win them over. 
In other cases, you may discover that your skills don’t fit well with the group. 
Or you may find that your own shyness inhibits your efforts at first. So we 
recommend that you give any such effort the time it takes to get over these 
concerns. You can also shop around until you find a comfortable fit.
Helping the environment
Maybe you’re thinking that you, as one person, can’t do much to affect the 
environment and natural disasters. But when millions of individuals each 
take steps to reduce the wear and tear on our planet, it adds up. So taking 
action can help reduce your anxiety about natural disasters. You become 
part of the solution, not part of the problem.
First, consider all the ways you can decrease your own carbon footprint. 
Turn that thermostat down a little in the winter and up in the summer. Run 
your dishwasher only when it’s totally full. Use electronic bill paying instead 
of paper. Change your light bulbs as they burn out to long-lasting, energy-
efficient bulbs. Search the Internet for a lot more ways to reduce your carbon 
footprint.
In addition, consider volunteering to help with the environment. Join a neigh-
borhood trash-pickup effort. Volunteer for a conservation project. Help main-
tain a public park trail. Get creative; you’ll come up with other possibilities.

242
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
Volunteering in disasters
One way to feel more empowered is to become involved in planning for and 
providing service in the face of natural disasters. Your local Red Cross has 
many opportunities for volunteers. You can offer to answer phones, file 
papers, or provide direct assistance to people affected by disasters. The Red 
Cross offers training and education to help people gain the skills necessary to 
help others. Volunteering gives back. Helping others can help you feel more 
powerful and less anxious.

▶ Accepting germs
▶ Taking stock of health risks

C
ontaminants in our food supply, poisons in the water, baby bottles that 
leak cancer-causing chemicals, stealthy antibiotic-resistant germs — have 
we got your attention? Oh wait, how about pesticides, black mold, asbestos, 
and lead paint? Invisible perils fill the world. No wonder many people worry 
about getting sick.
In this chapter, we talk about normal health concerns versus over-the-top 
health anxiety and worry. We point out that accepting a certain amount of 
risk is essential to maintaining emotional balance and a sense of well-being. 
We show you how to make an objective appraisal of your personal health risk 
factors and how to design a health action plan that makes sense.
Figuring Out the Connection 
between Worry and Health
Imagine that you’re in a crowded subway. The brakes come on unexpectedly 
and the car stops in the dark tunnel. An announcement comes on stating 
that because of an electrical problem, there will be a delay of up to an hour. 
You hear a collective chorus of sighs and mutterings. Then you notice the 
coughing and sneezing. You realize you’ve been holding onto a sticky hand-
rail that’s been touched by hundreds of people that same day. The tempera-
ture starts to rise, and you begin to smell the sweat and body odor wafting 
through the air. You notice a slight feeling of nausea in your stomach.

244
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
There’s no easy escape, and you begin to think that you may just come down 
with the flu or worse. And in fact, with all those people crammed together, 
surely one or two have something contagious. So if you find yourself worry-
ing about illness in circumstances like these, you’re not alone.
However, ask yourself this: Does your worry about getting contaminated in 
that subway car protect you from germs? Of course not.
 
Face it: Whether you’re afraid of getting sick or not, germs waft through the 
air, oblivious to your concerns. That’s the problem with most health anxiety. 
Worry doesn’t help keep you safe.
The following signs indicate that your worries about health exceed the defini-
tion of normal:
 
✓ You spend hours each day worrying about your health.
 
✓ You frequently ask others for reassurance about your health.
 
✓ Your worries interfere with your day-to-day life.
 
✓ You frequently go to the doctor for minor symptoms and rarely receive 
a diagnosis.
 
✓ You take unusual precautions to protect yourself from germs.
 
✓ You feel that nothing you can do will keep you well.
 
People who constantly worry about their health are at higher risk for depres-
sion. If you (or someone you care about) lose interest in activities that were 
once pleasurable; have changes in energy, sleep, or appetite; and feel helpless 
or hopeless; please check it out with your medical provider or a mental-health 
professional.
Some people find that their worries about health spin out of control. They 
avoid crowded places. When venturing out, they wear surgical masks and 
carry disinfectants. Fear causes them to severely restrict their activities 
and interferes with their ability to enjoy life fully. These people have health 
anxiety. Some carry the diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) that’s centered on health concerns. 
Others may have hypochondriasis, a persistent preoccupation with their 
belief that they have a disease, based on misinterpretations of symptoms, 
despite normal medical evaluations.
 
We don’t mean to imply that you shouldn’t take reasonable precautions to 
stay healthy. You should wash your hands after you use the restroom, after 
contacting obviously filthy surfaces, and before meals. Sometimes public 
health agencies may issue warnings to wash more frequently or even to wear 
masks in certain environments. And obviously, if you know someone who has 
a contagious disease, you’ll probably want to avoid close contact with that 
person.

245
 Chapter 16: Staying Healthy
But if you’re struggling to distinguish between what’s reasonable and what’s 
not, please see a mental-healthcare provider who can provide you with guid-
ance. Distinguishing between GAD, hypochondriasis, and OCD that’s focused 
on health worries requires an assessment by a mental-health professional.
Recalculating the Costs and 
Benefits of Health Worry
Take an honest look at your worry about health. Does your vigilance keep 
you safe? Maybe you believe that if you didn’t worry so much you’d end up 
getting sick. Or perhaps your health worries extend to family members. Do 
you think that you are somehow responsible for keeping others safe and 
healthy?
How do you express your worries about health? Is it by frequent trips to the 
doctor, time spent thinking about your health, or frequently asking others for 
reassurance? Whatever your personal expression of health anxiety is, the fol-
lowing exercise will help.
 
Carry out a cost/benefit analysis of your health concerns. On a piece of paper, 
in your notebook, or in your computer file, write about your own health anxi-
ety. Then, in a column on the left, write out all the benefits you believe that 
worrying about health gives you. Next, in a column on the right, write out all 
the possible costs your worry incurs. The following questions may help you 
discover the possible costs and benefits:
 
✓ How many times have I actually prevented what I fear the most?
 
✓ Does my worry really protect me in any way?
 
✓ How many times have I thought that I was sick when nothing was wrong?
 
✓ Is it possible that anxiety causes me to have other symptoms, such as 
stress and depression?
 
✓ If I do get sick, is there anything I can do to cope?
 
✓ How do others cope with what I’m worried about?
 
✓ Is there any evidence that I’m more likely to get sick than other people?
After completing the exercise, take another look at your answers. Decide for 
yourself whether your worry and anxiety keeps you safe. The following exam-
ple of Arturo, a young man who worries excessively about getting sick from 
contaminated food, illustrates the cost/benefit analysis.

246
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
Arturo doesn’t eat in restaurants because he worries about getting food 
poisoning. He believes that processing food increases the risk of indus-
trial contaminants, rodent droppings, bacteria, or viruses entering into 
the food supply. Thus, he only eats fresh produce that he buys at a local 
food co-op. He then takes special care to make sure that the food he 
buys is clean. Because of his strict diet, Arturo is slender and generally 
healthy.
He spends more than three hours each day choosing and cleaning his 
food. Despite these precautions, he frets and worries. His peculiar habits 
keep other people from being close to him. His loneliness leads to depres-
sion. His primary-care doctor refers him to a psychologist who helps him 
develop the cost/benefit analysis shown in Table 16-1 regarding his con-
cern about food contamination.
Table 16-1 
Arturo’s Cost/Benefit Analysis
Benefits
Costs
I don’t eat contaminated food.
I’m lonely and sad.
I eat healthy food.
I spend too much time on cleaning.
I am slim.
Even though I avoid lots of foods, 
I’m still pretty anxious all the time.
I save money by not eating at restaurants.
My doctor said that chronic anxiety 
and depression can make me sick.
I believe my worry protects me.
No one can be safe all the time; I 
could get hit by lightning or some-
thing and die early anyway.
Arturo sees that his over-concern about food has both costs and ben-
efits. He begins to understand that he can’t stay completely safe all the 
time. And if he does get sick, it’s likely that his illness can be treated. 
Furthermore, he sees that some of his perceived “benefits” for his worry 
are illusions. Thus, he could eat healthy food, stay slim, and still get sick 
whether he worries or not. He decides to take a chance and eat at a veg-
etarian restaurant with his cousin.
If you worry about your health, take Arturo’s approach. Make lifestyle 
changes that matter and realize that excessive worries can, by themselves, 
make you sick. Seek professional help if your health concerns persist in spite 
of your best efforts.

 Chapter 16: Staying Healthy
Tabulating Risks of the Modern World
In the early 1900s, you were lucky to live to age 50. People died of contagious 
diseases like tuberculosis and influenza or infections caused by simple inju-
ries. Heart disease, dementias, and cancers were less likely to be the cause of 
death only because people succumbed to infections before reaching old age.
Now, most industrialized countries boast a life expectancy well into the 70s. 
People over 100 are the fastest-growing sector of the world population, with 
expectations that this segment will be over 6 million strong by mid-century. 
Today, heart diseases and cancer have replaced contagious diseases as the 
most likely cause of death. Yet, it seems that as people live longer, they don’t 
appear to be living healthier. The skyrocketing costs of healthcare not only 
reflect improvement in care but also the fact that many more people have 
chronic diseases. In the following sections, we take a look at when it makes 
sense to keep tabs on diseases and epidemics and when you can safely 
ignore them.
Examining the evolving realities 
of diseases and treatments
Paradoxically, longer life spans and modern medicine give people more to 
worry about all the time. Even though people live longer, in a sense, they’re 
getting sicker. There are several reasons for this increase. First, more years 
of life equal more wear and tear on the body. Many diseases become more 
frequent with age, such as cancer, arthritis, dementia, and hormonal disor-
ders, so obviously, in an aging population, the risk for getting sick is greater.
Second, so-called advances in technology and medicine allow doctors to find 
disorders they never looked for in the past, such as prostate cancer. Even 
though the vast majority of “sufferers” have relatively few symptoms and 
eventually die of other causes, we now worry about such cancer and often 
experience significant side effects from the treatment itself. Furthermore, 
we treat things we never used to see as problems. For example, what used 
to be considered normal aches and pains in the knee can now be seen on an 
MRI and diagnosed as osteoarthritis. Unfortunately, the surgical treatment of 
osteoarthritis has recently been found to be no better than a placebo — the 
treatment consisted of giving some patients a sham surgery (the patients 
thought they received surgery, but actually did not — the surgeons even cut 
open their knees and stitched them right back up).

248
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
On the other hand, screening can prevent diseases from even occurring in 
the first place. For example, the dreaded colonoscopy can detect benign 
polyps before they become cancerous. Removing these polyps stops colon 
cancer before it has the chance to take hold. That’s wonderful.
Yet another interesting cost of medical advancement is the additional risk 
that some treatments carry. For example, acid reflux disease used to be called 
indigestion. Known to increase the risk of certain cancers, it’s now vigorously 
treated with medication to reduce or eliminate stomach acid. However, stom-
ach acid protects us against common bacteria such as salmonella. So people 
being treated for acid reflux may be at greater risk for food poisoning. Other 
medications such as antipsychotics (see Chapter 9) can help people with 
severe mental disorders but lead to weight gain and diabetes.
Another example can be found in the treatment of osteoporosis. 
Osteoporosis is defined as significant loss of bone density that results in an 
increased risk of bone fractures. This disorder can be successfully treated 
with medication. However, a rare side effect of long-term use of these medi-
cations results in collapse of bones (the very problem the treatment is sup-
posed to deter).
Finally, definitions of disease have changed over time. Blood pressure is 
now considered high and treatable at lower levels than before; the cutoff for 
normal cholesterol has also dropped. The idea is to treat diseases early to 
prevent later problems. That can be a good idea, but what constitutes dis-
eases sometimes gets out of hand, such as when normal sadness is defined as 
serious depression in need of medication.
Consider another example: Minor loss of bone density was once thought to 
be a common and normal result of aging. But today medical providers have 
started treating a “new” condition called osteopenia — a milder loss of bone 
mass than osteoporosis. Treating this newly diagnosed “disease” has led to 
a huge increase in sales of the drugs originally developed for osteoporosis. 
Because this disorder is usually found among younger people, the long-term 
effects of treatment with medication are not yet known.
 
Take the time to keep informed about the risks and benefits of treatments, and 
make modifications in your lifestyle as much as you can to stay healthy.
Weighing local versus global health risks
People who worry about their health sometimes focus on potential threats 
that are quite rare. Take some time and think about the risks of getting sick 
in your locality as compared to somewhere else in the world. For example, if 

249
 Chapter 16: Staying Healthy
you live in the United States or Canada, you’re pretty unlikely to come down 
with malaria or typhoid fever. And if you live in a country where adequate 
care is available, getting sick is not necessarily a death sentence.
On the other hand, millions of people throughout the world lack basic sanita-
tion, clean water, medical care, and food. These conditions breed and spread 
infections. Diseases that have been eliminated by improved sanitation or 
vaccines can be deadly when medical care is insufficient. Poverty, famine, 
disease, and violence shorten life spans to the mid or even early 30s in some 
countries.
Although your chances of getting the kind of diseases that regularly kill 
people in third-world countries are less than for those people who live in ter-
rible conditions, people travel all over the world. And infectious diseases can 
catch a ride. The following example illustrates:
Leroy travels to Indonesia. While there, he is bitten by a mosquito. He 
then travels to Paris for a short business trip. Sitting outside sipping wine 
at a French bistro, he is again bitten by a mosquito. That mosquito could 
infect someone in Paris with the tropical disease that Leroy carries. Leroy 
then returns to Chicago. Sitting outside on his deck on a hot summer eve-
ning, he gets bitten by another mosquito. That mosquito could possibly 
infect Leroy’s neighbor. A couple of weeks later, Leroy comes down with 
fever, chills, and a horrible headache. In severe pain, he goes to the hos-
pital and is diagnosed with malaria.
Leroy’s story shows how diseases can spread. Although malaria is quite 
rare in most of the western industrialized world, between 350 to 500 million 
cases occur in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Central and South America. 
About a million people die from it each year, mainly young children in certain 
regions of Africa. Most people who get sick in the United States are people 
who travel to those regions. Fortunately, inexpensive medications that pre-
vent malaria can be obtained before traveling to places where malaria is 
present.
So it’s a good idea to take reasonable precautions when traveling. Reasonable 
precautions include making sure that you’re up-to-date on vaccinations and 
checking with your medical provider if you’re traveling out of the country.
 
Wear mosquito repellent when you’re outdoors during a time that you might 
become infected by mosquito-borne diseases such as the West Nile virus, 
because this virus can occur almost anywhere on the planet.

250

The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) maintains a Web site that includes 
up-to-date information about infectious diseases throughout the world. You 
can click on any country and find out whether there are any travel restrictions 
or warnings. Go to http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel.
Watching out for exaggerated claims
People pay attention to unexpected events. So when something predictable 
happens, it’s less likely to be a focus of media scrutiny. For example, when 
an 88-year-old woman dies of a stroke in her sleep — unless she was rich or 
famous — there may be just a short obituary in the local paper. However, 
when a 3-year-old dies of a new type of flu that’s spreading around the world, 
that’s news. People talk about what’s in the news and the media goes to great 
lengths to bring you complete coverage of the story, so your awareness of an 
event like a toddler’s death from a new disease is heightened. As your aware-
ness goes up, your anxiety likely does too.
 
We’re not saying that the concerns about H1N1 flu (also known as swine flu) 
aren’t legitimate, but the probability of dying from heart disease or an auto acci-
dent are much greater than dying of all but the most catastrophic of pandemics.
Taking an Inventory of 
Your Personal Health
Accidents happen, and people get sick. And eventually, as far as we know, 
everyone dies. Whatever your own personal beliefs are about what happens 
after death, most people don’t look forward to dying. Some believe that 
people have a certain amount of time on this planet and what they do with 
their day-to-day lives doesn’t much matter. But how you live your life greatly 
affects your health and comfort, no matter what happens in the end, whereas 
worry never kept anyone healthy. So we recommend that you take a careful 
look at your lifestyle and your known family health risks, take whatever steps 
you can to minimize those risks, and then make the best you can out of each 
and every day.
 
So far, no one has been able to predict the future. Live each day fully and to 
the best of your ability. Worry and regret do not lead to better health.
Checking out your lifestyle
In Chapter 10, we highlight some of the lifestyle changes that you might con-
sider to improve your health and, hopefully, reduce your anxiety. Here we 

251
 Chapter 16: Staying Healthy
zero in on some of the health risks that may add to your worries. Many stud-
ies have looked at the factors that have the greatest impact on leading a long 
and healthy life. These studies follow people for decades and keep track of 
their health and habits. According to reports, more than a third to almost 90 
percent of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and stroke are caused by one or 
more of the following lifestyle choices:
 
✓ Smoking: If you don’t smoke, don’t start. If you’ve already started, quit. 
If people around you smoke, insist that they smoke outside. Secondhand 
smoke can hurt your health and the health of children. Make this a prior-
ity; get all the help you need.
 
✓ Weight: If you’re overweight, face the fact. Excess weight can — and 
eventually will — make you sick. There are hundreds of free Web sites 
that can help you determine your body mass index. If you carry that 
extra weight around your belly, you’re at higher risk for diabetes and 
heart attacks than if you carry it in your hips. Join a weight-loss group; 
talk to your doctor.
 
✓ Poor diet: Eat more fruits and vegetables and less saturated fat. Be 
aware that fiber keeps you full and keeps your digestive tract healthy.
 
✓ Lack of exercise: Get moving. Some exercise is better than no exercise, 
but exercising every day is best. Walk around briskly and get your heart 
pumping, dance, run, go to the gym. Weight-bearing exercise such as 
walking, running, or weight-lifting improves stamina, strength, and bone 
density.
 
✓ High blood pressure: Check your blood pressure. If you have high blood 
pressure, take medication and change your lifestyle to lower your risks.
 
✓ Sun exposure: Wear sunscreen if you’re outside for a long time, espe-
cially in the middle of the day. Don’t get sunburned.
 
✓ Inadequate medical care: Go to your doctor for regular checkups and 
talk to your doctor about any concerns that you have. Many diseases 
are treatable when caught early through screening tests.
Accepting your genetic risks
Although lifestyle changes can cut down most people’s risk of getting sick, 
certain people have genetic predispositions that can’t be overcome with 
good habits. For example, your family may have a high rate of cancer, heart 
disease, or diabetes. In such a case, your chances of getting sick are prob-
ably elevated, despite preventive care and good lifestyle choices. If that’s the 
case, take the precautions that make sense, talk to your doctor, and learn as 
much as you can about the condition.

Designing a Health Action Plan
After you’ve looked carefully at your lifestyle and taken into account your 
genetic risks, decide what steps you can take to improve your chances of 
having a long, healthy life. Don’t try and tackle everything at once; at first, 
just write down one or two small, achievable goals. The following examples 
can guide you:
 
✓ If you’re inactive, don’t plan on running the next marathon; start by 
walking 15 minutes a day, most days a week.
 
✓ If you have a family history of high cholesterol, get a referral to a dieti-
cian to talk about ways to improve your diet.
 
✓ Buy sunscreen and wear it every day. Daily use of sunscreen has the 
added benefit of keeping your skin looking young.
 
✓ Floss your teeth; it does more for your health than you think!
 
✓ Keep on trying to quit smoking. It may take lots of effort, but millions of 
people eventually do quit; you can too.
 
✓ Add one more serving of fruits and vegetables to your diet.
 
✓ Don’t put off medical screening tests — especially mammograms and 
colonoscopies.
 
✓ If you do get sick, be hopeful and optimistic.
 
✓ Stay connected with friends and family.
 
✓ Accept the fact that life and death are part of this world.
When you’ve accomplished one or two goals, add a new one. Keep the 
process going until you’ve really improved your health; your anxiety will 
decrease as your body feels better.

Keeping Out of Danger
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out how dangerous your world is
▶ Staying as safe as you can
▶ Dealing with scary events
▶ Letting go of worries
U
nexpected events frighten most people from time to time. Have you ever 
been in an airplane when turbulence caused a sudden dip of the plane 
as well as your stomach? Or watched in slow motion as another car careened 
across the road sliding in your direction? How about noticing someone wearing 
dark clothing, who’s nervously glancing around, sweating, and carrying a large 
bag at a ticket counter? Do you get a bit jumpy in a strange city in the dark, not 
sure which way to go, with no one around, when a group of quiet young men 
suddenly appear on the corner? Boo. Sorry if we scared you.
This chapter is about true feelings of stark terror and the emotional after-
math of being terrified. First, we take a look at your personal risks — just how 
safe you are and how you can improve your odds. Then we discuss methods 
you can use to prepare or help yourself in the event that something terrifying 
happens to you. Finally, we talk about acceptance, a path to calmness and 
serenity in the face of an uncertain world.
Evaluating Your Actual, Personal Risks
Chapter 15 discusses the fact that the risk of experiencing natural disasters 
is quite low for most people. But lots of people worry about them nonethe-
less. Interestingly, the same can be said about risks of terrorism. Billions of 
dollars are justifiably spent battling terrorist activities, and according to a 
2005 report in Globalization and Health, you’re 5,700 times more likely to die 
from tobacco use than an attack of terrorism. Similarly, the journal Injury 
Prevention noted in 2005 that you’re 390 times more likely to die from a motor 
vehicle accident than from terrorism.

254
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
However, your risk of exposure to some type of nonlethal, violent event 
is much greater. For example, around 3 million (about 1 percent) of all 
Americans will be involved in a serious motor vehicle accident in any given 
year. And about 1.4 million (slightly less than a half a percent) of the people 
of the United States alone will fall victim to some type of violent crime.
For those who sign up to serve and protect our country through the military, 
the risk of injury in combat varies greatly over time and also depends on the 
particular war. However, for someone in a combat zone, the risk of death 
pales in comparison to the chances that the person will experience serious 
injury or witness acts of severe violence to others — and then struggle emo-
tionally afterward.
 
Any exposure to violence, including just witnessing it, poses a major risk 
factor for developing what’s known as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
PTSD is a serious type of anxiety disorder that often follows exposure to one 
or more traumatic events. People find themselves having intrusive images 
of the event(s) and often work hard to avoid reminders of it. They also fre-
quently lose sleep, become easily startled, and experience increased irritabil-
ity (see Chapters 2 and 8 for more information about PTSD). The following 
section reviews what you can do to reduce your risks of experiencing trauma.
Maximizing Your Preparedness
No matter what your risks for experiencing violence, we advise taking reason-
able precautions to keep yourself safe. A little preparation usually doesn’t 
cost a lot in terms of either time or money. The key is making active deci-
sions about what seems reasonable and then trying to let your worry go 
because you’ve done what makes sense. If, instead, you listen to the anxious, 
obsessional part of your mind, you’ll never stop spending time preparing — 
and needlessly upset your life in the process.
Taking charge of personal safety
 
Chapter 15 lists important preparatory steps you can take in possible anticipa-
tion of natural disasters. Those same items apply to being prepared for terror-
ism and other violent situations. In addition, we recommend you consider a 
few more actions:
 
✓ Always have a stash of cash on hand.
 
✓ Have extra prescription medication for important medical conditions.
 
✓ Have a store of critical supplies, such as tissues and toilet paper.
 
✓ Have a multi-tool that can function as a screwdriver, can opener, knife, 
and so on.

255
 Chapter 17: Keeping Out of Danger
 
✓ Have some duct tape and plastic sheeting. Duct tape can fix a lot of 
things in a pinch and also serve to prevent windows from shattering. 
Plastic sheeting can be used to seal out toxic plumes.
 
✓ Have painters’ masks for everyone to reduce exposure to smoke and 
fumes.
 
Always keep at least a three-day supply of food and water for each household 
member.
Avoiding unnecessary risks
The best way to minimize your risk of experiencing or witnessing violence is 
to avoid taking unnecessary risks. Of course, regardless of what you do, you 
can’t protect yourself from life. People don’t ask to be victims of crime, ter-
rorism, or accidents, and you can’t prevent such events from ever occurring.
 
But you don’t have to ask for trouble either. We suggest the following, fully 
realizing that some of these may sound a little obvious. But because people 
often don’t follow these suggestions, here they are:
 
✓ Wear seatbelts; need we say more?
 
✓ Hold onto purses or bags tightly when walking in crowded areas.
 
✓ If you have a wallet, carry it in your front pocket.
 
✓ If you’re traveling, research the area for known risks. The U.S. State 
Department lists areas deemed unsafe for travel because of terrorism or 
other known risks at http://travel.state.gov.
 
✓ Make copies of your passport; give one to someone before you leave, 
and put another in your luggage separate from the bag you carry.
 
✓ Don’t wear expensive jewelry when you travel.
 
✓ Don’t drive in terrible weather conditions.
 
✓ Consider carrying a loud whistle in your purse or pocket.
 
✓ Heed the oft-given advice to report any unattended baggage in airports, 
train stations, or hotel lobbies.
 
✓ If you’re in a hotel room, don’t answer the door unless you know who it 
is. If you’re not sure, call the front desk.
 
✓ If you do have to walk in an unsafe area, walk quickly and pay attention.
 
✓ Have your keys out and ready as you approach your car, and look before 
you get in.
 
✓ Try not to walk alone in dark, secluded areas.

256
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
 
Finally, don’t limit your ability to enjoy life. Realize some risks are inevitable. 
Consider travel to places other than your backyard! Get to know some people 
from other cultures and lands. See some interesting landscapes. In other 
words, don’t wall yourself off from the world.
Dealing with Trauma
We hope you’re never a victim of nor a witness to severe violence, but we 
know it’s a real possibility. Violence occurs in war, on the streets, and even in 
the workplace. So if you’ve recently been a victim, you may be experiencing 
some serious signs of anxiety or distress. That reaction is pretty normal. And 
the first thing we’re going to tell you is that, unless your symptoms are quite 
severe and interfering greatly with your life, don’t seek out mental-health 
treatment right away! That’s because, in many cases, your mind’s own natu-
ral healing process will suffice.
 
Furthermore, it’s quite easy to interfere with natural recovery. For example, a 
single debriefing session often takes place after exposure to a traumatic event. 
In such a session, people are given basic information about trauma and its 
potential effects and are then encouraged to talk about how they’re coping 
with it. But such a session may actually increase the risk of emotional symp-
toms occurring or continuing. If you’re offered such a single-session interven-
tion, we suggest skipping it unless it’s obligatory. It’s perfectly okay not to 
want to talk about the trauma right away.
So here’s what we recommend you do first if you’re unfortunate enough to 
witness or experience a highly traumatic event:
 
✓ Realize that it’s normal to feel fearful and distressed.
 
✓ Talk to people you feel comfortable discussing the trauma with, but 
don’t let yourself be pressured to talk by anyone.
 
✓ Ask yourself what you’ve done in the past to get through tough times, 
and see whether that helps you get through this one. For example, some 
people find benefit from spiritual counseling, prayer, turning to friends, 
or increasing exercise.
 
✓ If you’re experiencing severe symptoms such as flashbacks, serious 
insomnia, significant irritability, or anxiety after a few months (even 
sooner if the symptoms are highly disturbing), consider seeing a mental-
health professional for three or more sessions. Be sure to ask if your 
therapist uses evidence-based treatment (that is, supported by scientific 
research) for PTSD (see Chapters 2 and 8 for more information about 
PTSD).

257
 Chapter 17: Keeping Out of Danger
 
In working on the ideas we discuss in the following sections, we strongly rec-
ommend that you do so in collaboration with a licensed mental-health profes-
sional who has experience treating PTSD.
Thinking through what happened
When people have been exposed to trauma, the experience never goes away. 
In other words, you can’t ever completely erase the experience from your 
mind. But with help, the misery and pain can decrease, and life satisfaction 
can get much better.
Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) was developed by Patricia Resick and 
colleagues and has been shown to help some survivors get to a better place. 
With this approach, you take a hard look back and write a statement about 
the meaning that the traumatic event had for you in your life. In other words, 
describe how you think your life has changed:
 
✓ Do you feel responsible for the trauma?
 
✓ Do you feel unsafe everywhere you go?
 
✓ Have you changed the way you feel about yourself as a person?
 
✓ Are you angry, sad, or ashamed?
Your therapist will then help you explore your feelings and how your 
thoughts may be contributing to making things worse than they need to be 
for you. Among other things, your therapist may ask you these questions:
 
✓ How does this event affect the way you see yourself and the world?
 
✓ What would you tell a friend that this event meant about him or her as a 
person? Can you accept saying the same thing to yourself?
 
✓ Do you know anyone who has coped with something like this? If so, how 
did they do it?
 
✓ Do you believe that you’re more unsafe than anyone else? If so, what is 
the evidence that you are?
 
✓ Did you want this traumatic event to happen to you? If not, can you stop 
blaming yourself?
 
✓ Is there anything shameful about having been a victim of trauma or 
violence?
 
✓ Can you think of a creative new possibility that could result from this 
challenge? For example, could you volunteer to help others in similar 
situations?

258
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
Finally, your therapist is likely to ask you to write about the actual traumatic 
event in great detail. Then you’ll probably be asked to read that story out 
loud to yourself every single day for a period of time. As you do, don’t try to 
squelch your emotions; instead, let the feelings flow. You can also embellish 
your story with more detail over time.
Some professionals consider this written account and the reading of the 
traumatic event to be a form of exposure therapy. Preliminary evidence 
suggests that this part of CPT may work as well as exposure, which we dis-
cuss in the next section. However, repeatedly reading your written account 
of the event may be somewhat less distressing than more direct exposure 
strategies.
Exposing yourself to the incident
Exposure therapy, as we describe in Chapter 8, has been supported by more 
research studies than any other approach for treating PTSD. Briefly, exposure 
therapy involves making extended contact with the traumatic event, usually 
through imagery. For example, a combat veteran may be asked to make an 
extensive list of all the details of his traumatic combat experiences. He would 
then be asked to list each detail and rate it for how much distress it causes 
him when he thinks about it.
The list is organized into a hierarchy, or what we call a staircase of fear. 
Starting with the least upsetting step, he would be asked to imagine it in 
detail until his anxiety and distress drop significantly. Then he would move 
on to the next step. See Chapter 8 for details and a specific example applied 
to PTSD.
The main problem with this approach lies in the fact that lots of trauma vic-
tims really don’t want to revisit their trauma. Thus, the very idea of therapy 
elicits feelings of great distress. For some, exposure seems like adding more 
suffering to their already traumatized lives. For that reason, among others, 
far too many trauma victims fail to get treatment.
 
If you find that the prospect of exposure therapy seems completely 
overwhelming to you, consider seeking CPT first. Not every mental-health 
professional has been trained in both exposure therapy and CPT, so be sure 
to ask.
Accepting a Certain Degree of Uncertainty
Emotional distress stemming from traumas and violence presents a chal-
lenge, yet it’s quite normal. It’s important to realize that people can’t control 
the emotions that arise from such causes. The more you can accept that fact, 

259
 Chapter 17: Keeping Out of Danger
the more easily you’ll be able to cope with life and whatever it deals you. The 
next two sections take a look at accepting uncertainty and risk.
Choosing to put yourself 
in high-risk situations
Some people, like police officers, emergency medical personnel, soldiers, and 
firefighters, choose to expose themselves to the best and worst of life. Their 
motives are positive: They may have a strong desire to help others, feel a 
deep sense of patriotism, or want to make a positive difference in the world. 
These people often become traumatized by the horrible events and disasters 
that they must deal with. And a good percentage of them end up with symp-
toms or a diagnosis of PTSD.
Those who fully understand and accept both the risks of the job and the 
fact that they may experience emotional distress from exposure to trauma 
just may be a little less vulnerable to traumatic events than those who see 
themselves as invincible. Paradoxically, the more you can accept whatever 
responses you have, the more easily you’ll probably deal with them.
However, those who view themselves as indestructible may actually choose 
to go into their fields with an inflated sense of invulnerability. These people 
are more likely to have emotional pain from their experiences and refuse or 
shun help. They believe that part of their job is to handle whatever happens 
to them. Sadly, they’re not immune to horror and trauma, yet they think that 
they should be.
 
If you or someone you care about has a front-line position in a field like medi-
cal care, law enforcement, or the military, you’re at risk, just like everyone 
else, for getting a stress disorder from exposure to horrible events. This 
doesn’t make you weak or less competent. You must bravely face your emo-
tional pain and get help. Denying the emotional pain dulls your ability to con-
tinue to help others.
Experiencing danger in everyday places
A lot of people live lives in which they try to stay away from danger. But life 
happens to them as well. People are exposed to violence in places that were 
once considered safe: schools, churches, synagogues, mosques, parks, and 
the workplace. Uncertainty in this world is certain.

260
Part IV: Zeroing in on Specific Worries 
The only alternative to acceptance of risk and uncertainty is to devote your 
entire life to anticipating and avoiding risk. The problem here is that your 
efforts will still fail you. Even if you spend every waking moment trying to 
avoid risk, it won’t work. So far we know of no one who has managed to avoid 
the ultimate risk of death.
The following story illustrates typical symptoms of PTSD following a motor 
vehicle accident, which is by far the most common avenue to getting PTSD in 
most parts of the world.
Lew had always assumed, like most people do, that a green light signals 
it’s safe to proceed through an intersection. He had driven with that 
assumption for 20 years without mishap. One day on the way to work, 
Lew drives through an intersection that he has safely traversed hun-
dreds of times before. Suddenly, an SUV barrels through the red light and 
broadsides Lew’s sedan. Lew suffers serious injuries. After several weeks 
in the hospital, he spends months in rehabilitation.
When Lew returns to driving, he finds himself creeping through intersec-
tions with intense feelings of anxiety. He can barely make himself drive 
to work and back each day and avoids driving whenever possible. He 
frequently visualizes the accident, although he tries very hard not to. His 
body aches with tension. He wakes up in the middle of the night before 
he has to drive and can’t go back to sleep. He’s irritable and moody.
Lew’s doctor tells him that he now has high blood pressure and that 
he needs to reduce his stress. Lew worries about his worry but doesn’t 
know what he can do about it. He thinks he may have to take a leave 
of absence from work. His supervisor is losing patience with him. 
Desperate, Lew makes another appointment with his doctor. This time, 
the doctor takes time to ask Lew about his symptoms. He refers Lew to a 
psychotherapist who specializes in working with people with PTSD.
The therapist recommends exposure therapy (see the earlier section 
“Exposing yourself to the incident”) involving a series of steps that start 
with talking about the accident and gradually increase in difficulty up to 
repeatedly driving through busy intersections. However, Lew can’t get 
past the first couple of steps. He berates himself for failing to progress. 
Now Lew feels anger, not only about his accident but also toward himself.
The therapist backs up and works on acceptance. He helps Lew to see 
that feelings are just feelings, not something to be avoided. He teaches 
Lew how to remain in contact with his emotions without judging them. 
Lew gradually learns to accept his emotions for what they are. Then the 
therapist works on CPT (see the section “Thinking through what hap-
pened”), and Lew makes excellent progress.

Unusual, unpredictable endings
Consider asking yourself how you could avoid 
these calamitous yet impossible-to-predict 
events. Please realize that we’re not trying to 
be funny about or make light of tragic, violent, 
and horrific events. Our point is simply that you 
can never know how to predict and avoid the 
unpredictable. As we said, life has risks.
 ✓ A vacationing couple was left in the Great 
Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia when 
a dive boat crew member failed to count 
them upon returning to the boat — their 
bodies were never recovered.
 ✓ A surgeon in Houston was decapitated by 
an elevator door closing on his head.
 ✓ A 28-year-old woman died of drinking too 
much water in a radio station contest.
 ✓ An employee fell into a large tank of hot, 
melting chocolate and died after being 
knocked unconscious by one of the mixing 
paddles.
 ✓ A lawyer threw himself into a glass window 
to prove that the glass was unbreakable; 
unfortunately, he discovered that the win-
dowpanes themselves broke out, and he 
fell from the 24th floor of the building.
 ✓ Every player on a soccer team in Africa was 
killed instantly by a forked bolt of lightning.
 ✓ A 24-year-old was trying to heat up a lava 
lamp on his kitchen stove; it exploded with 
such force that a shard of glass pierced his 
heart and killed him.
 ✓ Nine people were killed when over a mil-
lion liters of beer burst out of a huge vat, 
causing a chain reaction that ripped open 
surrounding vats of beer and flooded the 
streets. The flood of beer filled surround-
ing houses and pubs, drowning those in 
its path. The BBC referred to the event as 
a beer tsunami; it’s more commonly known 
as the London Beer Flood of 1814.
 ✓ And if you think the London Beer Flood 
sounds bad, there’s always the Boston 
Molasses Tragedy. In 1919, 2.3 million gal-
lons of molasses burst through a large stor-
age tank and sent a wall of molasses about 
15 to 20 feet high, wiping out homes and 
buildings and trapping people in the sweet 
goo. Twenty people were killed and about 
150 injured. Months later, globs of molasses 
still clung to doors, sidewalks, and streets.

f someone you care about has anxiety and worry, you 
naturally want to help. In this part, we detail what you 
can do. First, we help you find out whether your loved one 
suffers from anxiety, and then we show you how to talk 
about it. We also provide strategies for working together 
on the problem.
Today’s kids appear more anxious than ever, about fears 
both real and imagined. We help you distinguish between 
normal and abnormal childhood fears. In the final chapter 
in this part, you discover how to prevent your children 
from developing abnormal fears and what to do if they 
have too much anxiety. We conclude by advising you 
when to seek professional help and telling you what to 
expect if you seek it.

When a Family Member or Friend 
Suffers from Anxiety
In This Chapter
▶ Finding out whether your partner or a friend has anxiety
▶ Communicating about anxiety
▶ Coaching your anxious acquaintance
▶ Working together to fight anxiety
▶ Accepting your anxious friend or family member
P
erhaps your friend, partner, or relative gets irritated easily, avoids 
going out with you, or often seems distant and preoccupied. Possibly 
he seems overly worried about sickness, money, or safety. Maybe he shuns 
physical intimacy. Or he may leave parties, concerts, or sports events early 
for no apparent reason.
You could easily take his behavior personally. You may think he doesn’t love 
you, care about you, or is angry with you. And if these behaviors represent a 
recent change, it’s difficult to know what’s going on for sure. But it could be 
that your friend or partner actually suffers from anxiety.
This chapter helps you figure out whether someone you care about suffers 
from anxiety. We also help you communicate effectively with a loved one who 
has anxiety. With the right communication style, instead of provoking feel-
ings of anger and resentment, you may be able to negotiate a new role — that 
of a helpful coach. You can also team up to tackle anxiety by finding ways 
to simplify life, have fun, and relax together. Finally, we explain how simply 
accepting your partner’s anxiety and limitations leads to a better relationship 
and, surprisingly, less anxiety.
 
For convenience and clarity in this chapter, we mostly use the term “loved 
one” to refer to any partner, friend, or relative that you may be concerned 
about.

Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
Discovering Whether Your Loved 
One Suffers from Anxiety
People who live together sometimes don’t know each other as well as they 
think they do. Most people try to look and act as well adjusted as they can, 
because revealing weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities isn’t easy. 
Why do people hide their anxious feelings? Two big reasons for hiding them 
include
 
✓ Fear: Revealing negative feelings can be embarrassing, especially to 
someone with an anxiety disorder. People often fear rejection or ridi-
cule, even though self-disclosure usually brings people closer together.
 
✓ Upbringing: Children may have been taught to repress or deny feelings 
by their parents. They may have been told, “Don’t be such a baby,” or 
“Boys don’t cry.” When taught to hide feelings, people grow up keeping 
concerns to themselves.
So how do you really know whether your loved one has a problem with 
anxiety? And does it matter whether you know or not? We think it does. 
Understanding whether your partner experiences anxiety promotes better 
communication and facilitates closeness.
The following list of indications may help you to discern whether your part-
ner suffers from anxiety. Ask yourself whether your partner
 
✓ Seems restless and keyed up
 
✓ Avoids situations for seemingly silly reasons
 
✓ Ruminates about future catastrophes
 
✓ Can’t ever seem to throw anything away
 
✓ Is reluctant to leave the house
 
✓ Spends inordinate amounts of time arranging things
 
✓ Has trouble sleeping or staying asleep
 
✓ Has trouble concentrating
 
✓ Has frequent nightmares
 
✓ Avoids situations or places reminiscent of a past traumatic event
 
✓ Is plagued with self-doubts
 
✓ Has episodes of noticeable shakiness and distress
 
✓ Is constantly on alert for dangers
 
✓ Seems unusually touchy about criticism

267
 Chapter 18: When a Family Member or Friend Suffers from Anxiety
 
✓ Seems plagued by excessive superstitions
 
✓ Is overly worried about germs, contamination, or dirt
 
✓ Seems unusually concerned about health
 
✓ Has frequent, unexplained bouts of nausea, dizziness, or aches and 
pains
 
✓ Frequently rechecks whether the doors are locked or the coffee pot is 
turned off
 
✓ Constantly worries about everything
 
✓ Seems terrified by anything specific, such as insects, dogs, driving, thun-
derstorms, and so on
 
✓ Responds with irritation when pushed to attend social functions, such 
as parties, weddings, meetings, neighborhood functions, or anywhere 
you may encounter strangers (the resistance could be due to simple dis-
like of the activity, but carefully consider whether anxiety may lie at the 
root of the problem)
 
A couple of the symptoms in the preceding list (especially irritability, poor 
concentration, poor sleep, and self-doubts) can also indicate depression. 
Depression is a serious condition that usually includes loss of interest in activ-
ities previously considered pleasurable, changes in appetite, and depressed 
mood. See Chapter 2 for more information about depression. If your loved one 
seems depressed, talk with her and then consult with a mental-health practi-
tioner or your family physician.
Now, if you answered yes to any of the questions in the preceding list (and 
your partner doesn’t seem particularly depressed), we don’t recommend that 
you approach your loved one and say, “Look at this list — you’re a nut case! I 
knew it.” That would be a really bad idea.
 
Instead, consider asking your loved one a few questions. This definitely 
shouldn’t occur immediately following a conflict or argument. Possible ques-
tions to ask include:
 
✓ What’s the biggest stress in your life lately?
 
✓ What worries you the most?
 
✓ Sometimes, when I go to events like this, I feel anxious. I’m wondering 
how you’re feeling about going?
 
✓ How were you feeling when we left the party?
 
✓ How are you feeling about that problem?
 
✓ I’ve noticed you’ve had trouble sleeping lately. What’s been on your 
mind?

268
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
 
Try to make your questions as nonthreatening and safe to answer as possible. 
In addition, try to ask questions that don’t have a simple yes or no answer. For 
example, if you ask your partner whether she’s anxious, she may reply with a 
simple “No,” and then the discussion is over. But if you ask what worries she 
has, you may get a more complete response. Finally, asking “what” or “how” 
works better than asking “why” someone is feeling anxious — people often 
can’t answer “why” they feel the way that they do.
Our list of questions for you about your loved one’s anxiety and our list of 
questions to ask your loved one open the door to communicating about anxi-
ety. After you broach the subject and confirm that the one you care about 
struggles with anxiety, you can build a plan from there. But you need to know 
how to keep the conversation going.
Talking Together about Anxiety
Talking about a loved one’s vulnerability isn’t always easy. Keeping a few 
ideas in mind may help. For example, if you find the conversation turning 
into an argument, it’s not helpful. Back off. Your loved one may not be ready 
to face the problem. If so, you may want to check out the “Accepting Anxiety 
with Love” section later in this chapter.
 
Not every couple communicates easily about difficult subjects without arguing. 
If that’s the case for the two of you, we suggest relationship counseling — read-
ing a few pages about talking together won’t solve fundamental communication 
problems. But if you’re able to talk together about anxiety without experiencing 
a communication breakdown, we have some general guidelines for you in the 
following sections.
 
If your loved one has a problem with anxiety, you may find yourself feeling 
oddly ambivalent about helping. Sometimes, those confusing feelings come 
from the fact that seeing one’s partner improve can upset the power balance 
in a relationship. If you prefer being the boss in your relationship, you may 
feel uncomfortable seeing your partner get better and become more equal 
to you. If you see that struggle in yourself, we suggest you seek relationship 
counseling. You’re likely to discover that a more equal relationship feels 
better than your unconscious mind thinks it will.
Helping without owning the albatross
The first order of business in a discussion of your partner’s anxiety is to 
show empathetic concern. That means putting yourself in your partner’s 
shoes and seeing the world through his eyes. Then you can try to understand 
the source of the worry.

269
 Chapter 18: When a Family Member or Friend Suffers from Anxiety
However, expressing empathy and concern doesn’t mean that you need to 
solve the problem. You can’t. You may be able to help, as we show in the 
“Guiding the Way” section later in this chapter, but you don’t control the 
emotions of other people — they do.
 
Realizing that helpers don’t own the responsibility for making change happen 
is important. Otherwise, you’re likely to become frustrated and angry if and 
when efforts to change stall. Frustration and anger only make overcoming 
anxiety more difficult.
Avoiding blame
Just as you don’t want to blame yourself by owning the problem when your 
partner becomes anxious, it’s equally important to avoid blaming your part-
ner. Your loved one developed anxiety for all the reasons we list in Chapters 
3 and 4. Nobody asks for an anxiety disorder. Nobody wants one, and change 
is difficult.
 
People sometimes get upset when they try to help and the response they get 
consists of resistance and a lack of gratitude. But your loved one may resist 
your help because anxiety is like an old habit. It may not feel good, but at least 
it’s familiar. When you start to work on reducing anxiety, anxiety typically 
increases before it gets better.
Therefore, make every effort to avoid blame and be patient. Success and 
failure aren’t up to you. You want to help, but if change doesn’t happen, it 
means nothing about you.
When help turns into harm
People with anxiety desperately seek ways to alleviate their distress. One 
common way is to ask for reassurance. If it’s your partner who has anxiety, 
of course you want to help by giving that reassurance. For example, people 
who have a great fear of illness often ask their spouses if they look okay or if 
they’re running a temperature. Unfortunately, reassuring your partner makes 
anxiety increase over time.
 
How can something designed to alleviate anxiety create more anxiety? Well, 
the immediate reduction in anxiety reinforces or rewards the act of seeking 
assistance. Thus, giving reassurance teaches the recipient to look for answers 
elsewhere, rather than to depend on his own good sense. Both dependency 
and anxiety thereby increase.

Asking for reassurance can take many forms. Sometimes, it’s hard to spot. In 
Table 18-1, we give you some examples of reassurance requests and alterna-
tive ways to handle them. The first column gives a brief description of the 
basis for the fear or anxiety and the reassurance request, and the second 
column gives you an alternative response to offering reassurance.
Table 18-1 
Responding to Reassurance Requests
Ways Your Loved One May Seek 
Reassurance
New Ways of Responding
Someone with generalized anxiety dis-
order may be worried about being late 
and ask, “Do you think we’ll be on time?” 
or “When will we be there?” or “Do you 
think that we left enough time for traffic?”
“You never know,” or, “I can’t really 
predict the future.”
A person with obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD) who worries about locking 
the doors asks, “Do you think I locked the 
doors?” or “Could you check and see if I 
locked the doors?” 
“Checking to see if doors are locked 
doesn’t help you, so I’m not going to 
respond.”
A loved one with OCD who worries about 
contamination asks, “Do you think it’s 
safe to use that restroom?”
“We talked about the fact that I can’t 
answer questions like that.” 
A loved one with agoraphobia asks, “Do 
you think I’ll be able to handle going to the 
game with you?”
“I don’t know; I guess we’ll just have 
to try it and find out.”
Someone with a fear of flying asks, “Do 
you think the weather will be okay for this 
flight?”
“Gosh, it’s pretty hard to predict the 
weather.” 
A person who has social anxiety asks, 
“Will you make sure that I know the 
names of everyone there?”
“Well, I may not know all the names 
and I may not always remember 
them. You can always tell people 
you’ve forgotten their name.” 
A loved one who worries about getting 
sick asks, “Do you think I may be getting 
sick?”
“I really don’t know. We’ve talked 
about me letting you handle this 
worry.” 
 
If you’ve been in the habit of giving your partner frequent, large doses of reas-
surance, don’t suddenly stop without discussing the issue first. Otherwise, 
your partner is likely to think you’ve stopped caring. You need to let your 
partner know and come to an agreement that eliminating unnecessary reas-
surance is a good idea. Then, agree that you’ll reassure once on any given con-
cern, but when asked repeatedly, you’ll simply smile and say, “We agreed that 
I can’t answer that.”

271
 Chapter 18: When a Family Member or Friend Suffers from Anxiety
The following anecdote demonstrates how reassurance can aggravate anxiety 
and how alternative responses can help. At first, James hooks Roberto into 
feeling overly responsible for his insecurity and anxiety. Roberto provides 
more and more reassurance, and James keeps getting worse. A psychologist 
suggests a new response.
James and Roberto have lived together for the past three years. Both 
graduate students, they lead busy lives. Lately though, James has 
stopped attending social events, complaining of fatigue. Roberto finds 
himself going alone and misses James’s company.
Roberto receives an announcement that he’s the recipient of this year’s 
Departmental Dissertation of the Year Award. Of course, he wants James 
to attend, but James fears sitting alone and feeling trapped. Roberto reas-
sures James that the auditorium is safe and that he could get out if he 
needed to by sitting on the aisle. James still resists, so Roberto suggests 
they get Brenda, a good friend of theirs, to accompany him.
Finally, after considerable cajoling and reassurance, James agrees to go 
to the event. He spends the time in the audience clinging to Brenda. He 
feels momentarily comforted by Brenda’s presence and reassurances 
that everything will be okay. But he believes he couldn’t have made it 
through the awards ceremony without her there to hold his hand.
As each new outing comes up, it seems that James requires more reas-
surance and attention. James withdraws, becoming more isolated, and 
his anxiety increases.
Then James finally sees a psychologist who suggests enlisting James’s 
friends to help out. He asks them to provide James new, alternative 
responses to his reassurance-seeking. At the next event, Roberto insists 
that James go on his own. When James asks Roberto, “Do you think I’ll 
fall apart?” Roberto tells him, “You’ll just have to try it and find out.”
Initially, Roberto fell into the trap of not only being empathetic but also 
owning James’s problem. His “help” only served to increase James’s depen-
dency. James eventually learns to rely on his own resources and feels 
empowered by doing so.
 
Unfortunately, when you own your partner’s problem by giving too much reas-
surance and excessive help, it usually just makes things worse. Dependency, 
avoidance, and anxiousness all deepen. It’s a matter of balance. Give truly 
needed help and show real concern, but avoid going too far.
Guiding the Way
Assuming you’ve had a healthy discussion with your partner about her anxi-
ety problem, you may be able to help further. But first, take a look at 

272
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
yourself. If you also wrestle with anxiety, do all that you can for yourself 
before trying to tackle your partner’s anxiety.
After you take care of your own anxiety, you may want to consider coaching 
your partner to overcome her anxiety. A coach is a guide who encourages, 
corrects, and supports. Part of the job of a coach requires modeling how to 
handle stress and worry. You can’t do a good job of modeling if you’re quak-
ing in your boots.
Coaches can help carry out one of the most effective ways of overcoming 
anxiety: gradual exposure. Exposure involves breaking any given fear into 
small steps and facing that fear one step at a time. If any given step creates 
too much anxiety, the coach can help devise ways of breaking the task into 
smaller pieces. The following sections offer points to keep in mind when 
you’re helping a loved one overcome her anxiety.
 
In all but the mildest cases of anxiety, a professional should oversee the 
coaching process. Be sure to read Chapter 8 for important details about expo-
sure prior to attempting to help your partner carry out an exposure plan. If 
your partner resists or argues with you, consult a professional. Of course you 
want to help, but it isn’t worth harming your relationship to do so.
 
Professional coaches have emerged in large numbers over the past decade. 
These people vary widely in their training and experience. You may want to 
use one of these folks to help carry out an exposure plan, but you don’t want 
one of these people to diagnose an anxiety disorder or design a treatment plan 
from beginning to end. The only exception to this rule of thumb is a coach 
who also happens to be a licensed mental-health professional.
Coaching the right way
So exactly how does a coach help a loved one who has problems with anxi-
ety? In most cases, coaches help the one they care about carry out exposure 
tasks. In other cases, coaches simply provide encouragement and support on 
the sidelines. Our discussion here focuses on the former role.
Generally, your participation in coaching would first come as a suggestion 
from the therapist working with your loved one. However, you may bring up 
the possibility yourself. In either case, you only want to serve as a coach if 
your partner clearly expresses an interest in and a desire for your assistance.
 
Coaching won’t work if your partner doesn’t feel ready to tackle her anxiety. 
Coaching also won’t work if your loved one doesn’t want your involvement. In 
fact, the effort could easily harm your relationship if you push your help too 
hard.

273
 Chapter 18: When a Family Member or Friend Suffers from Anxiety
 
Not everyone is cut out to be a coach. Coaching requires significant patience, 
compassion, and time. If you don’t have those things in abundance, don’t 
agree to be a coach. Perhaps you can help your loved one in other ways, such 
as by taking on a few extra household tasks or simply by being an interested, 
supportive bystander.
Assuming you choose to accept the position, coaching requires you to take 
the following actions to be the best coach you can be:
 
✓ Define your role: Come to a clear understanding of how much and what 
type of input your loved one and her therapist want. Do they want you 
to be involved in the planning? How so? Ask whether they want you to 
simply observe the exposure activities or actively encourage carrying 
out the tasks involved with exposure. Make sure they’re specific about 
what they want you to do. For example, ask whether you should stand 
next to your partner, hold a hand, or stand a few feet away during expo-
sure tasks.
 
✓ Encourage while keeping emotions in check: Because you care so 
much, it’s really easy to let your emotions guide your behavior while 
you coach. You want to encourage, but do so gently and calmly. Be care-
ful not to
 
• Push too hard. If your partner says “enough,” it’s enough.
 
• Become too enthusiastic about progress. Your partner may feel it 
as pressure.
 
• Get angry or argue. Remember to accept whatever your partner is 
able to do.
 
• Become tearful or discouraged.
 
• Feel overly involved with the process.
 
• Start losing sleep.
 
 If the coaching process causes you to become overly emotional or 
upset, back off. You may not be the right person for this job. That 
doesn’t mean you don’t care; in fact, you may simply care too much to 
be a good coach.
 
✓ Avoid excessive responsibility: Your loved one must develop an expo-
sure plan, usually in concert with a therapist. You may help the one you 
care about develop a few details of the plan, but don’t take on the full 
responsibility for designing an exposure hierarchy. People who have 
problems with anxiety frequently feel insecure and ask for excessive 
help and reassurance. Don’t be pulled in by your loved one’s insecurity.

274
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
 
✓ Stick with the plan: Resist the temptation to improvise. After a plan is 
in place, stick to it. If changes need to be made, consult with your loved 
one or have her discuss it with her therapist. Don’t throw in surprises.
 
✓ Remain positive: Coaches need to avoid criticism and judgment. Your 
loved one won’t be spurred on by negative comments from you. People 
work hard for praise and become immobilized and defensive in response 
to criticism. Avoid saying anything like, “You should be able to do this,” 
or, “You aren’t working hard enough.”
 
✓ Maintain realistic expectations: After the plan is in place, expect your 
partner to have ups and downs. Some days go better than others. Small 
steps eventually go a long way. But you must always remember that 
determining how the plan plays itself out isn’t up to you.
 
✓ Execute the game plan: After an exposure plan has been developed, the 
next step is to begin with relatively easy tasks. A good coach provides 
support and feedback. In addition, the coach can model, reward, and 
focus attention. Here are a few additional tips:
 
• Before asking your loved one to carry out a step, see whether she 
wants you to model the task first. If you model, showing a small 
amount of anxiety yourself is fine if you feel it.
 
• Practice going through the steps with imagery first. In other words, 
describe the scene in detail and have your loved one imagine it 
first. Don’t carry it out in real life until your partner feels more 
comfortable with the imagery. You can consult Chapter 8 for 
details about using your imagination through exposure as well.
 
• Set up some rewards for success at a few intervals along the hier-
archy. Do something you can enjoy together. You can also give 
some honest praise for success; just be sure not to sound patron-
izing or condescending.
 
• If the person you care about appears anxious at any step but not 
overwhelmed, encourage staying with that step until the anxiety 
comes down 50 percent. Obviously, don’t absolutely insist, just 
encourage. Remind your partner that anxiety comes down with 
enough time.
Looking at a coach in action
Coaching someone you care about can seem overwhelming. The follow-
ing example about Doug and Rosie helps you see how one couple worked 
through a mild case of anxiety with the help of a good game plan.
Doug and Rosie have dated for over a year. In all that time, they’ve never 
gone to a movie together because Rosie wrestles with a mild case of ago-
raphobia. Although she’s able to go most places and do what she needs 

275
 Chapter 18: When a Family Member or Friend Suffers from Anxiety
to in life, she dreads going anywhere that makes her feel trapped, espe-
cially movie theaters. She fantasizes that she’ll need to get out, but she 
won’t find her way to an exit because of the crowd and the darkness. She 
imagines that she would trip over people, fall on her face, and desper-
ately crawl through the darkened theater.
Doug realizes that Rosie makes one excuse after another to avoid going 
to movies, even though she enjoys watching them on television. Gently, 
he asks Rosie, “Some things make me a little anxious — heavy traffic or 
big crowds — what makes you anxious?” Rosie confesses that crowded 
movie theaters make her feel closed in and trapped.
Several days later, Doug sees a copy of Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies 
in a bookstore and buys it with Rosie in mind. He starts reading, paying 
particular attention to Chapter 8 about exposure. Doug and Rosie have a 
productive discussion about her concerns and decide to face them. Doug 
volunteers to coach.
First, together they devise a staircase of fear, which breaks down the 
feared situation into small steps. (See more on the staircase of fear in 
Chapter 8.) Rosie’s staircase of fear consists of the 12 steps shown in 
Figure 18-1.

276
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
Doug plays a role in most of Rosie’s tasks. He helps her write a script 
for the imagined scenes. He reads the script out loud to Rosie while she 
closes her eyes and tries to picture the experiences. She rates her level of 
anxiety, and during the first few steps, he stays with her until her anxiety 
goes down.
Not only does he accompany her to the movies, but he also celebrates 
her successes and encourages her when she starts to falter. He holds 
her hand on the easier items and gives less support toward the end. 
Gradually, Rosie feels less anxiety when watching movies with Doug.
It takes attending a number of movies with Doug before she agrees to the 
final tasks of going by herself. In fact, they begin enjoying their nights at 
the movies and find that they both love talking about their experiences 
afterwards over coffee and dessert. Although Rosie balks at going to 
the theater by herself, her comfort level has increased over the last few 
months.
Rosie and Doug drive to the theater together on her last two items, but 
he chooses a movie playing on a different screen. Although Rosie feels 
frightened, she sticks it out. She feels good about her accomplishment, 
and the two of them become closer.
Rosie’s fear of the movies had not yet reached the level of severely interfer-
ing with her life. Therefore, it was a good choice for a relatively simple expo-
sure plan. Had Rosie not dealt with her fear in this early stage, it would likely 
have spread from fear of movies to fear of other crowded places.
 
Most people with fears, obsessions, or compulsions need to develop a plan with 
the help of a therapist. However, the example of Rosie and Doug can serve as an 
illustration of how a simple plan can be carried out without a therapist.
Teaming Up against Anxiety
 
One way you can help your partner overcome anxiety is to collaborate on 
ways to decrease stress in both your lives. With a little ingenuity, you can 
explore a variety of solutions that are likely to feel good to you even if you per-
sonally don’t suffer from anxiety at all. For example:
 
✓ Take a stress management class at a local center for adult continuing 
education. These classes help people make lifestyle changes and set 
goals. Many of the ideas make life more fun and interesting in addition to 
reducing stress.
 
✓ Take regular walks with your partner. It’s a great way to reduce stress, 
but even if you don’t have much stress, strolling under the sky together 
is a wonderful time to talk and is great for your health.

277
 Chapter 18: When a Family Member or Friend Suffers from Anxiety
 
✓ Take a yoga, Pilates, or tai chi class together. Again, even if you don’t 
have anxiety, these classes are terrific for balance, muscle strength, flex-
ibility, and overall health.
 
✓ Explore spirituality together. You may choose to attend a church, a 
synagogue, or a mosque, or scope out a less traditional method of com-
muning with a higher power, such as immersing yourselves in nature. 
Thinking about things bigger than yourselves or the mundane events of 
the world provides a peaceful perspective.
 
✓ Look for creative ways to simplify your joint lives. Consider looking for 
help with household chores if you both work. Carefully analyze the way 
that you spend time. Make sure that your time reflects your priorities. 
See Chapter 10 for more ideas.
 
✓ Do something good. Consider jointly volunteering for a worthwhile 
cause or charity. Many people feel that such work enhances the mean-
ing and purpose of their lives. Look at animal shelters, food banks, hos-
pitals, and schools as possibilities. Even an hour every other week can 
make a positive difference.
 
✓ Get away. Take a vacation. You don’t have to spend much money. And 
if you don’t have the time for a long vacation, go away for an occasional 
evening at a local hotel. Getting away from texting, telephones, e-mails, 
doorbells, and other endless tasks and demands, even for a night, can 
help rejuvenate both of you.
Accepting Anxiety with Love
It may seem rather counterintuitive, but accepting your loved one’s battle 
with anxiety is one of the most useful attitudes that you can take. Acceptance 
paradoxically forms the foundation for change. In other words, whenever you 
discuss your loved one’s anxiety or engage in any effort to help, you need to 
appreciate and love all your partner’s strengths and weaknesses.
You fell in love with the whole package — not just the good stuff. After all, 
you’re not perfect, nor is your loved one. You wouldn’t want perfection if you 
had it. If perfect people even existed, we can only imagine that they would be 
quite boring. Besides, studies show that people who try to be perfect more 
often become depressed, anxious, and distressed.
 
Therefore, rather than expecting perfection, accept your loved one as is. You 
need to accept and embrace both the possibility of productive change as well 
as the chance that your partner may remain stuck. Accepting your partner is 
especially important when your efforts to help
 
✓ Result in an argument
 
✓ Seem ineffective

278
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
 
✓ Aren’t well-received by your partner
 
✓ Seem merely to increase your partner’s anxiety even after multiple expo-
sure trials
What does acceptance do? More than you may think. Acceptance allows you 
and your loved one to join together and grow closer, because acceptance 
avoids putting pressure on the one you care about. Intense expectations only 
serve to increase anxiety and resistance to change.
Acceptance conveys the message that you will love your partner no matter 
what. You’ll care whether your partner stays the same or succeeds in making 
changes. This message frees your loved one to
 
✓ Take risks
 
✓ Make mistakes
 
✓ Feel vulnerable
 
✓ Feel loved
 
Change requires risk-taking, vulnerability, and mistakes. When people feel that 
they can safely goof up, look silly, cry, or fail miserably, they can take those 
risks. Think about it. When do you take risks or try new things? Probably not 
around an especially critical audience.
Giving up anxiety and fear takes tremendous courage in order to face the 
risks involved. Letting go of your need to see your partner change helps bol-
ster the courage needed. Letting go of your need includes giving up your ego. 
In other words, this is not about you.
When you take on the role of a helper, it doesn’t mean that your worth is at 
stake. Of course, you want to do the best you can, but you can’t force others 
to change. Your loved one ultimately must own the responsibility.

▶ Looking at the most common anxiety disorders among kids
M
any adults can recall childhood as being a time of freedom, explora-
tion, and fun. Not too many years ago, kids rode bikes in the street 
and played outside until dark. Kids walked to school — with other kids.
Now, anxious parents wait with their children at bus stops until they’re safely 
loaded. Parents rarely allow kids to leave the home without adult supervi-
sion. Parents worry about predators, kidnappers, and violence. They feel 
understandably protective. However, anxiety spreads from parents to their 
children. No wonder so many children experience anxiety.
Some anxiety is typical at certain ages. In this chapter, you discover the dif-
ference between normal and problematic anxiety in kids. We explain that 
some childhood fears are completely normal, while others require interven-
tion. Then we take a look at the symptoms of anxiety disorders in children. 
(We devote Chapter 20 to ways you can ease your child’s anxiety. If you’re 
concerned about a particular child, we urge you to seek professional diagno-
sis and treatment.)
Separating Normal from Abnormal
Childhood anxiety has grown to epidemic proportions during the past 40 
to 50 years. Numerous studies confirm this alarming development, but one 
in particular is a shocker. Psychologist Jean Twenge compared symptoms 

280
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
of anxiety in today’s kids with symptoms in seriously disturbed kids receiv-
ing hospital treatment in 1957. She reported in the Journal of Personality and 
Social Psychology (December 2000) that boys and girls today report a greater 
number of anxiety symptoms than psychiatric inpatient children in 1957.
Should these findings cause alarm? We think so. The statistics are bad 
enough in their own right, but when you consider the fact that anxiety disor-
ders often precede the development of depression later on, it raises concerns 
that the consequences of childhood anxiety could worsen in the years to 
come.
So what’s going on? Why do our children experience emotional turmoil? 
Of course, we all know the complexities and tensions of the world today — 
longer work hours, rapidly developing technologies, violence on television, 
and even terrorism. We also suspect that certain types of parenting hold par-
tial responsibility, as we discuss in Chapter 20.
For the moment, what you as a parent need to know is how to distinguish the 
normal anxieties of childhood from abnormal suffering. Realize that the vast 
majority of kids feel anxious at various times to one degree or another. After 
all, one of the primary tasks of childhood is to figure out how to overcome 
the fears that life creates for everyone. Successful resolution of those fears 
usually results in good emotional adjustment. You just need to know whether 
your children’s fears represent normal development or a more sinister frame 
of mind that requires help. Look at Table 19-1 to get an idea of the anxiety 
that you can expect your children to experience at one time or another 
during their youth.
Table 19-1

If this continues with no 
improvement after 36 to 48 
months, then you have some 
cause for concern.
Fear of unfamiliar 
adults
Common from 6 to 10 
months.
Don’t be too concerned 
unless you see this after 2 
or 3 years of age. And don’t 
worry about a little shyness 
after that.

 Chapter 19: Recognizing Anxiety in Kids

Fear of unfamiliar 
peers
Common from age 2 
until around 3 years 
old.
If this continues without 
showing signs of reduc-
ing after 3 years, you have 
some cause for concern.
Fear of animals, dark-
ness, and imaginary 
creatures
Common between 
ages 2 and 6 years.
If these fears don’t start to 
decline by 6 years of age, 
you have cause for concern. 
Many kids want a night 
light for a while; don’t worry 
unless it’s excessive. 
School phobia
Mild to moderate 
school or day-care 
phobia is common 
from ages 3 to 6; it 
can briefly reappear 
when moving from 
elementary to middle 
school.
This should decline and 
cause no more than minimal 
problems after age 6. A brief 
reemergence at middle 
school is okay, but it should 
quell quickly. If not, it’s a 
concern.
Fear of evaluation by 
others
This fear almost 
defines adolescence. 
Most teens worry 
a fair amount about 
what others think of 
them.
It should gradually reduce 
as adolescence unfolds. But 
it’s not uncommon for it to 
last through the late teens. 
Table 19-1 gives you some general guidelines about so-called normal child-
hood fears. However, independent of age, if fears seem especially serious 
and/or interfere with your child’s life or schoolwork in a major way, they may 
be problematic and warrant attention. In addition, other anxiety problems 
we describe in the section “Inspecting the Most Common Childhood Anxiety 
Disorders,” later in this chapter, are not particularly normal at any age.
 
If you have any doubts about the seriousness of your children’s anxiety, you 
should consider a professional consultation. A mental-health counselor or 
your pediatrician should be well-equipped to handle your questions, quite 
possibly in a single visit. Anxiety problems sometimes predate other emo-
tional difficulties, so you shouldn’t wait to get them checked out.

282
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
Inspecting the Most Common 
Childhood Anxiety Disorders
Some fear and anxiety are normal for kids. You can probably remember being 
afraid of the dark, monsters, or ghosts. However, other types of anxiety, 
though not always rare, do indicate a problem that you should address. We 
briefly review the more common types of problematic anxiety in kids in the 
following sections.
Leaving parents: Separation anxiety disorder
As we show in Table 19-1, kids frequently worry about separations from their 
parents when they’re as young as 6 months to perhaps as old as 4 years of 
age. However, significant fear of separation past about the age of 4, accompa-
nied by the following, warrants intervention:
 
✓ Excessive distress when separated from caregivers or anticipating such 
separation
 
✓ Exorbitant worry about harm to parents or caregivers
 
✓ Obstinate avoidance of school or other activities because of worries 
about separation
Sleep terror in children
Childhood sleep disorders, one of the most 
common complaints brought to pediatricians, 
can disrupt the whole family. Children usually 
outgrow sleep disorders, such as bedwetting, 
frequent awakenings, and problems going to 
sleep.
Sleep terror, especially strange and frighten-
ing to parents, is relatively common, occurring 
among 1 to 6 percent of all kids; the incidence 
among adults is less than 1 percent. Sleep 
terror tends to present itself about an hour and 
a half after going to bed. The child typically sits 
up suddenly and screams for up to half an hour. 
During the episode, the child is actually asleep 
and is difficult to awaken and comfort. Children 
don’t remember their sleep terror in the morn-
ing. Sleep terror most often occurs when chil-
dren are between ages 4 and 10. By the time a 
child is a teenager, it usually disappears.
Direct treatments for sleep terror are unavail-
able as yet. But then again, because children 
don’t remember it, sleep terror usually doesn’t 
cause the children who have it any daytime 
distress. Too little sleep may increase the likeli-
hood of sleep terror, so parents should make 
sure their children get enough sleep. And stress 
may also contribute to sleep terror, so parents 
should attempt to alleviate stress and other 
anxieties in their children.

 Chapter 19: Recognizing Anxiety in Kids
 
✓ Refusal to go to bed without being near a parent or caregiver
 
✓ Frequent nightmares about separation
 
✓ Frequent physical complaints, such as headaches, stomachaches, and 
so on, when separated from parents
Among the various anxiety disorders, separation anxiety disorder (SAD) is 
relatively common in kids, but that doesn’t mean it’s normal. The average 
age at which it seems to start is around 7 to 8 years. The good news is that 
a large percentage of those with separation anxiety disorder no longer fulfill 
the diagnostic criteria for the disorder after three or four years.
 
The bad news is that quite a few of these kids go on to develop other prob-
lems, especially depression. For that reason, we suggest prompt intervention 
if it persists longer than a month or two and interferes with normal life.
The following story about Tyler and his mother Julie illustrates a typical 
presentation of separation anxiety in the form of a school phobia. Note that 
school phobia often also includes an element of social phobia (see the sec-
tion “Connecting with others: Social phobia” later in this chapter).
Julie doesn’t know what to do about her 7-year-old son, Tyler. Every day, 
she battles with him about going to school. At first, she thinks he’s really 
sick, so she takes him to the pediatrician. After a complete physical, the 
doctor reassures her that Tyler is healthy. The doctor encourages Julie 
to send Tyler to school and warns that if she doesn’t, Tyler’s behavior is 
likely to escalate.
“My stomach hurts,” whines Tyler. “I don’t want to go to school.”
“Now sweetie, you’ve missed so many days,” soothes Julie, “you really 
should go today; you’re not that sick.”
“But my stomach really hurts; it really, really does Mommy.” Tyler begins 
to sob. “Besides, the other kids don’t like me.”
“You will go to school today,” Julie says firmly, grabbing Tyler by the 
hand. Tyler plants his feet and pulls away, screaming. Julie can’t believe 
what he’s doing. He actually seems terrified; Julie’s never seen him 
behave this way. Frantically, Tyler runs to his bedroom and hides in his 
closet. Julie finds him huddled, sobbing.
Tyler suffers from school phobia, a common but serious childhood anxi-
ety disorder involving anxiety about both separation from parents and 
social worries.
Wisely, Julie decides to seek further professional help. Most school counsel-
ors have had lots of experience in dealing with school phobias. See the side-
bar “Getting back to school” for a typical treatment strategy.

Sometimes, what appears to be a school phobia is actually a result of a child 
having been bullied at school. School counselors and teachers can help sort 
this out for you. Be sure to ask them to check into this possibility.
Worrying all the time: Generalized 
anxiety disorder
Based on what we know today, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is fairly 
common among kids and more common among older kids than younger 
ones. It most often develops at the onset of puberty or shortly thereafter and 
is characterized by
 
✓ Excessive anxiety and worry about school, friendships, or family 
problems
 
✓ Physical symptoms, such as stomachaches, headaches, or loss of 
appetite
 
✓ Difficulty concentrating and/or irritability
 
✓ Problems sleeping, restlessness, or agitation
Getting back to school
School phobia is a relatively common separa-
tion anxiety in childhood. The treatment for 
school phobia involves getting the child back 
to school as soon as possible. Children with 
school phobia often have parents who are 
slightly anxious themselves and care deeply 
about their kids. The first step is to convince the 
parents that they must be firm in their commit-
ment to return the child to school.
A good way to calm the child and get him 
back to school is to allow for one brief contact 
between parent and child each day for a few 
weeks. The parent carries a cellphone. With 
agreement from the child’s teacher, the child 
receives a get-out-of-class pass (usable only 
once each day) that allows the child to call his 
parent. The parent then speaks to the child for 
only an agreed-upon two minutes. The child is 
encouraged to save the pass for times of great 
distress and praised when he doesn’t use the 
pass at all during a day.
This pass, allowing a parental phone call, grad-
ually fades to one call every other day, one call 
a week, and so on. After the first few days, if 
the parents and teachers remain supportive 
and firm, the problem usually vanishes. If this 
strategy fails, there are many other techniques 
for overcoming school phobias. Consult a men-
tal-health professional who specializes in child 
anxiety.

285
 Chapter 19: Recognizing Anxiety in Kids
Focusing on phobias: Specific phobias
Most young kids at one time or another exhibit fear of the dark or monsters in 
the closet. So don’t worry if your child has these fears unless the fear becomes 
so intense that it disrupts daily living in a significant way. The typical age of 
onset of a real phobia (as opposed to the earlier, minor fears) is about age 8 or 9.
 
Specific phobias are exaggerated, intense fears that cause a child to avoid a 
particular object or situation. See Chapter 2 if you want more information on 
this type of anxiety.
Connecting with others: Social phobia
Some kids are just plain shy. They’re born that way, and relatives often make 
comments like, “He’s just like his dad was at that age.” Sometimes, shyness 
decreases with age, but when shyness swells and causes a child to fearfully 
avoid social encounters in everyday life, your little one may have a problem.
Social phobia usually doesn’t manage to get diagnosed until around 10 years 
of age. Signs generally appear at a younger age, but parents often have trou-
ble distinguishing it from shyness until then. You can pick up on it sooner 
if you observe your children carefully. If their fears of unfamiliar peers or 
adults show no improvement whatsoever by age 3 or so, you may want to 
check with a professional to determine whether the problem is serious. See 
Chapter 2 for more information about social phobia.
Anxious repetition: Obsessive-compulsive 
disorder
This type of anxiety is somewhat less common than SAD, GAD, specific 
phobias, and social phobia. Nevertheless, almost 1 in 50 teens has obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD). Often beginning in childhood, OCD develops on 
average at around age 10. However, it can occur as early as 4 or 5 years of 
age; boys tend to get it earlier than girls do.
Obsessions are recurring, unwanted thoughts that your child can’t stop (see 
Chapter 2 for more details). Some of the most common obsessions among 
children include
 
✓ Excessive fear of intruders
 
✓ Fear of germs
 
✓ Fear of illness
 
✓ Fixation on certain numbers

286
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
Compulsions involve rituals or various behaviors that your child feels com-
pelled to repeat over and over. Common childhood compulsions include
 
✓ Arranging objects in a precise manner
 
✓ Excessive hand-washing
 
✓ Hoarding items of little value
 
✓ Repeatedly counting stairs, ceiling tiles, and steps taken while walking
 
Many children perform a few harmless rituals that involve magical thinking, 
such as not stepping on sidewalk cracks. However, any child that exhibits seri-
ous signs of OCD should be evaluated. It doesn’t matter at what age it shows 
up, because OCD tends not to improve without treatment. The good news is 
that treatment really works!
Rare anxieties among children
A few anxiety disorders that occur in adults show up infrequently in children:
 
✓ Agoraphobia is often a response to panic and involves avoidance of 
places or situations in which you feel no escape is readily available.
 
✓ Panic disorder involves a sudden onset of intense fearfulness, terror, and 
physical symptoms. It usually doesn’t appear until late adolescence or later.
 
✓ Post-traumatic stress disorder is a response to some traumatic event in 
which the person develops hyper-arousal (a heightened state of alert), intru-
sive thoughts about the event, and avoidance of any reminders of the event.
See Chapter 2 for more details on all these anxiety disorders. If any of these 
anxieties show up in your children, we recommend a professional consultation.
Post-traumatic stress disorder among children
Although thankfully rather rare in children, 
PTSD symptoms are slightly different among 
kids than adults. Like adults, children can get 
PTSD from abuse or other directly experienced 
trauma. (PTSD among New York City kids spiked 
after the September 11 terrorist attacks. Fourth 
and fifth graders were particularly affected.) 
Also, similar to adults, kids can develop PTSD 
from witnessing trauma happening to others, 
such as seeing a parent beaten.
Children with PTSD become restless, agitated, 
irritable, and unfocused. Instead of having 
nightmares and intrusive thoughts, children 
may act out their terror in play. They may have 
bad dreams, but these usually don’t have con-
tent specifically relevant to the trauma. Like 
adults, they become anxious and alert to any 
possible sign of danger. They also tend to over-
react to trivial incidents, such as being bumped 
into or criticized.

W
e think it’s pretty tough being a kid today. We picked up our grand-
daughter at school the other day. Before leaving, we wrote her name 
on a big sign and placed it on the dashboard. We waited in a line of minivans 
and SUVs for more than 30 minutes while teachers walked around with bull-
horns calling out children’s names so that the drivers could identify them-
selves. The children waited like cows in a secure, fenced-in area. Most of the 
vehicles in line had DVD players hanging like the screens in taxicabs — 
separating the adults from the kids, who become immobile prisoners in compli-
cated car seats. Wow, just getting picked up from school can arouse anxiety.
How can parents and other concerned adults help children navigate this 
complex world without developing anxiety? In this chapter, we give parents 
and caregivers some guidance on how to prevent anxiety from taking root. 
But some kids will have anxiety despite parents’ best intentions, so we also 
provide tips on ways to help those kids who do. Finally, we take a look at 
signs that indicate the possibility that a child needs professional help, who to 
seek for such help, and what to expect from mental-health professionals.
Nipping Anxiety in the Bud
How does anxiety begin? The risk for developing anxiety begins at concep-
tion. That’s right, studies of twins have demonstrated that almost half of 
what causes anxiety lies in your genes. However, that’s just the beginning. 
Many other factors come into play, and you can do much about these factors, 
as we explain in this section.

288
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
Early mastery experiences
When a hungry or uncomfortable baby cries out and parents respond by 
feeding or comforting, the baby experiences a beginning sense of mastery. In 
other words, what the baby does results in a predictable outcome. This early 
opportunity can be repeated thousands of times over the next few years in 
various ways. For example, the toddler discovers how to use language to 
make requests that then get rewarded. If parents respond unpredictably and 
chaotically to an infant’s attempts to control his or her environment, anxiety 
is likely to increase.
So to decrease the probability of anxiety, responding predictably to young 
children is imperative. For young infants, parents should respond with rea-
sonable consistency to most of their distress. Later, predictability is still 
important but should occur only to age-appropriate distress or requests. In 
other words, you wouldn’t want to reinforce a 2-year-old’s temper tantrums 
by caving in.
 
As your children grow older, you should provide as many opportunities as 
possible for them to experience a feeling of mastery. You can do this by
 
✓ Involving them in sports
 
✓ Interesting them in hobbies that require some skill
 
✓ Playing games of skill, such as puzzles or Scrabble
Anxiety’s brain chemistry
Recent research at Columbia University 
explored the effect of the brain chemical sero-
tonin (a neurotransmitter thought to influence 
mood), which is produced naturally in the body, 
on the development of anxiety. Experimenters 
bred mice that lacked important receptors for 
serotonin, which left them unable to use this 
important neurotransmitter. They found that 
mice between 5 and 20 days old without the 
ability to process serotonin developed mouse 
anxiety as adults. But when they raised mice 
with normal serotonin receptors and later 
depleted the mice of serotonin when they had 
reached adulthood, the mice didn’t develop 
anxiety.
What does this research have to do with anx-
ious kids? It points to the importance of biologi-
cal factors in the development of anxiety. Even 
prenatal and early infantile experiences may 
affect emotional well-being long into the future. 
Perhaps treating childhood anxiety early can 
help to prevent future problems.
More research is needed to understand how 
all this works. However, we know that biologi-
cal interventions (such as medications) affect 
serotonin levels, and it appears that behavioral 
strategies, such as those described in this book, 
also alter brain chemistry in productive ways.

289
 Chapter 20: Helping Kids Conquer Anxiety
 
✓ Making sure that they have the chance to experience success at school 
and getting immediate help if they start struggling with their studies
 
✓ Training them to have good manners and social skills
Fine-tuning emotions
One of the most important tasks of childhood consists of learning how to 
control emotions, tolerate frustration, and delay gratification. Again, young 
infants need prompt gratification. However, with increasing age, the world 
tends to look unfavorably upon those who demand instant gratification and 
rejects those who can’t keep a reasonable lid on their emotional outbursts.
 
You can help your child learn these crucial skills of emotional regulation. 
Helping children express emotions without letting them run out of control 
involves a few basic steps:
 
✓ Validate your children’s emotions. When children feel distressed, anx-
ious, or worried, validate their emotions. You do that by saying,
 
• “I see that you’re a little afraid of . . .”
 
• “You seem worried about . . .”
 
 This validating statement should also try to help your children connect 
the feeling to what’s going on.
 
✓ Don’t deny your children’s feelings. To the greatest degree possible, 
don’t deny the feeling or try to take it away. In other words, you don’t 
want to say, “You shouldn’t be scared,” or, worse, “You’re not really 
afraid.”
 
✓ Don’t overprotect. No one likes to see children feel fearful or anxious. 
However, they need to figure out how to deal with most fears on their 
own. If you try to solve all their problems or keep them from all worries 
and danger, you’re doing more harm than good.
 
✓ Help your kids learn to calm down. You can teach them to take a few 
slow, deep breaths or count to ten slowly. You can also explain that 
extreme anxiety and fear will lessen eventually.
 
✓ Praise your children. When they make efforts to overcome anxieties, 
praise your kids. However, don’t punish them for failing to do so.
 
✓ Don’t provide unnecessary reassurance. Making comments such as, 
“There’s nothing to be afraid of” is unnecessary. Kids need to find out 
how to handle a little stress and anxiety on their own. Don’t constantly 
reassure them or you’ll create a surefire path to anxiety.

290
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
Inoculating against anxiety
Experiencing certain situations, activities, animals, and objects commonly 
turns into a phobia. The following list of children’s fears shows that children 
experience fears that are often similar to those that adults experience:
 
✓ Airplanes
 
✓ Being alone
 
✓ Dogs
 
✓ Heights
 
✓ Rodents
 
✓ Snakes
 
✓ Spiders and insects
 
✓ Thunder and lightning
 
If you want to prevent your children from acquiring one of these common pho-
bias, you can inoculate them. You do that by providing safe interactions with 
the potentially feared event or object — prior to any fear developing. Try the 
following activities:
 
✓ Take your kids to a museum or zoo that offers hands-on experiences 
with snakes and insects.
 
✓ Climb a mountain together.
 
✓ Watch a storm from the safety of your living room couch. Discuss how 
lightning and thunder work.
 
✓ If you don’t have a dog or cat of your own, go to the pound and visit 
puppies and kittens.
Research has proven that this method works. For example, studies have 
shown that children bitten by dogs don’t develop a phobia as readily if they 
have had past, positive experiences with dogs. Children who fly at an early 
age rarely develop a phobia to flying. The more experiences you provide your 
children with, the better their chances are of growing up without phobias.
 
If you’re somewhat phobic yourself, try not to make faces or get too squea-
mish when you inoculate your kids against phobias. Don’t say, “Oooh, how 
gross!” Even if you feel nervous, try not to show it.
Taking precautions via parenting style
Parents can set children up to develop an anxiety disorder, or parents can 
help to prevent anxiety, depending on their parenting style:

291
 Chapter 20: Helping Kids Conquer Anxiety
 
✓ Permissive parents engage with their kids and show concern and caring. 
But permissive parents hate confrontation, and they abhor seeing their 
kids feel bad. Therefore, they set low expectations for their children, 
and they don’t push them to act mature or try new things.
 
✓ Authoritarian parents represent the opposite extreme. They demand, 
direct, and expect instant obedience from their children. They control 
every detail of their children’s lives and tend to be overly structured and 
hostile.
 
✓ Authoritative parents take the middle road. These parents set reason-
able limits and boundaries. They’re flexible and aware of their kids’ 
developmental stage. They try to help their kids understand the reasons 
behind their expectations for good behavior, although they don’t spend 
a whole lot of time reasoning, or debating, with their kids.
Keep reading for more details about how each of these parenting styles 
affects a child’s anxiety level.
Permissive and authoritarian parenting
Both the permissive and the authoritarian types of parents fuel anxiety in 
children. The following story is about both types. The mother demonstrates 
permissive parenting, and the father is an authoritarian.
Four-year-old Nancy screams with terror. Her parents rush into her room 
to see what’s wrong. “There’s a bad man in my room; I saw him,” she 
cries.
Nancy’s mother hugs her, strokes her hair, and tells her, “Everything will 
be okay now that Mommy’s here.”
Her dad turns on the light. He checks her closet and under her bed and 
snaps, “There’s nobody here. Just stay in your bed and go to sleep. Don’t 
be such a baby.”
When this scene reenacts itself night after night for six weeks, Nancy’s dad 
becomes increasingly annoyed and speaks harshly to her about what he calls 
her silly fears. At the same time, her mother overprotects Nancy. Her mom 
even starts to sleep in her room to make her feel safe. Her fears only inten-
sify. Poor Nancy receives mixed messages from her parents, and neither mes-
sage helps.
Authoritative parenting
 
A different kind of parenting can help your kids deal with anxiety better. It’s 
called authoritative (as opposed to authoritarian) parenting. Authoritative par-
ents provide clear expectations for their children. They encourage their kids 
to face challenges. They validate their children’s feelings of anxiety but urge 
them to deal with them. They aren’t harsh or punitive, but they don’t overpro-
tect. Using Nancy’s story again, the following demonstrates how authoritative 
parents would deal with Nancy’s anxieties.

292
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
Four-year-old Nancy screams with terror. Her parents rush into her room 
to see what’s wrong. “There’s a bad man in my room; I saw him,” she cries.
Nancy’s mom gives her a quick hug and says, “You sound afraid, sweetie.”
Her dad turns on the light, checks the closet and under the bed, and says, 
“Nobody’s here, honey. But if you’d like, we can leave a night light on.”
Nancy says, “Please don’t leave me alone. Can’t Mommy just stay here 
with me tonight?”
Nancy’s mom tells her, “No, you need to handle this yourself. I know you’re 
worried, but it will be okay.” They turn the night light on and tell her, 
“Here’s your bear; he’ll keep you company. We’ll see you in the morning.”
Nancy cries softly for a few minutes and falls back to sleep.
Nancy’s parents were lucky that she only cried for a short period of time. 
They felt a bit guilty for letting her cry but realized that Nancy needs to learn 
that she can handle a little anxiety on her own. Some kids aren’t so easy.
Perhaps your child keeps on crying and won’t stop. Well, sometimes that 
happens. Occasionally, you may need to hang in there for an hour or two. 
The first night is usually the worst. Don’t give up. Eventually, the vast major-
ity of kids start falling asleep sooner. If that doesn’t happen after four or five 
nights in a row, you may need to consult a professional.
Helicopter parenting
The term helicopter parenting has gained popu-
larity in the past decade. Think of a helicopter 
hovering over you, following you throughout 
each day as you go about your business. 
Specifically, these parents direct their kids’ 
lives, run interference for them whenever they 
can, and try to shield them from all bad feel-
ings. Thus, a helicopter parent will complain to 
teachers about grades or assignments, argue 
with coaches, and confront their children’s 
peers when a conflict occurs.
It’s bad enough when helicopter parents hover 
in this manner during elementary school. But 
some of these folks never stop. They continue 
to prevent their teens from experiencing the 
consequences of their own behavior and mis-
judgments. Some of these parents even write 
their kids’ college papers for them. In fact, a 
few colleges have found that parental interest 
is so intense that parent-teacher associations 
(PTAs) have sprung up on campus.
Helicopter parents often have high expecta-
tions of their kids, unlike permissive parents. 
However, they’re similar to permissive parents 
in that they can’t stand seeing their kids feel 
frustration or upset. The problem with both 
types of parents is that they fail to teach their 
kids how to deal with life’s difficulties. Anxiety 
often results.

293
 Chapter 20: Helping Kids Conquer Anxiety
Helping Already Anxious Children
If you have a child with anxiety, don’t make yourself anxious by blaming 
yourself for the problem. Multiple factors probably went into making your kid 
anxious (for more information, read Chapter 3). And you probably weren’t 
able to read this book prior to your child developing anxiety, so you didn’t 
know what you could do to prevent it. So now what do you do? Read on.
Helping yourself first
If you’ve traveled on a commercial flight, you’ve probably heard flight atten-
dants instruct you about how to deal with the oxygen masks should they 
drop down. They tell you to put the mask on yourself prior to assisting your 
child. That’s because if you don’t help yourself first, you won’t be in any con-
dition to help your child.
 
The same principle applies to anxiety in your kids. You need to tackle your 
own anxiety prior to trying to help your children. Children learn many of their 
emotional responses by observing their parents; it makes sense that anxious 
parents more often end up with anxious children. The nice part of getting rid 
of your own anxiety first is that this is likely to help your children, as well as 
give you the resources for assisting with their worries.
You can do this by reading this book for yourself. Pick and choose the strat-
egies that best fit your problem and personality. However, if the ideas you 
choose first don’t seem to work, don’t despair. The vast majority of the time, 
one or more of the techniques that we describe does help.
 
If you find that reading this book and trying our recommendations don’t 
reduce your anxiety as much as you’d like, consider consulting a mental-
health professional who’s trained in cognitive behavioral therapy.
Modeling mellow
If you don’t have a problem with anxiety or if you’ve overcome your exces-
sive worries for the most part, you’re ready to teach by example. Children 
learn a great deal by watching the people they care about. You may recall 
a time when your child surprised you by repeating words you thought or 
wished he hadn’t heard. Trust us, kids see and hear everything.

294
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
 
Therefore, take advantage of every opportunity to model relatively calm 
behavior and thinking. Don’t invalidate your child’s anxiety by saying it’s a 
stupid or silly fear. Furthermore, demonstrating complete calm is not as useful 
as showing how you handle the concern yourself. Table 20-1 shows some 
common childhood fears and how you can model an effective response.
Table 20-1 
Modeling a Better Way
Fear
Parental Modeling 
Thunderstorms
“I understand a thunderstorm is coming tonight. 
Sometimes, I get a little nervous about them, but I 
know we’re safe at home. I’m always careful to seek 
shelter during a thunderstorm. But I know that thun-
derstorms can’t really hurt you when you’re inside.”
Insects
“I used to think that insects were gross, awful, and 
scary, but now I realize that they’re more afraid of me 
than I am of them. Insects run away from people when 
they can. Sometimes, they’re so scared that they freeze. 
I admit that I still use plenty of tissue to pick them up, 
and that’s okay. Let me show you how I do it.”
Heights
“I sometimes feel a little nervous looking down from 
high places. Here we are on the top of the Washington 
Monument. Let’s hold hands and go to the window 
together. You can’t fall off, and it can’t hurt you. 
Looking down from heights is kind of fun. The scari-
ness is kind of exciting after you get used to it.”
Being alone (don’t say 
this unless your child 
expresses anxiety about 
feeling safe alone)
“Your father’s going on a trip tomorrow. I used to 
feel afraid staying at home by myself, but I realize 
that I can take pretty good care of myself and of 
you. We have a security door, and if anyone tries 
to get in, we can always call the police. Our dogs 
are pretty good protection, too. Do you ever get 
scared? If you do, we can talk about it.”
Leading children through anxiety
As we discuss in Chapter 8, gradual exposure to whatever causes anxiety 
is one of the most effective ways of overcoming fear. Whether the anxious 
person is a child or an adult, the strategy is much the same. Therefore, if 
you want to help your children who already have anxiety, first model coping 

295
 Chapter 20: Helping Kids Conquer Anxiety
as we describe in Table 20-1. Then, consider using exposure, which involves 
breaking the feared situation or object into small steps. You gradually con-
front and stay with each step until anxiety reduces by 50 percent or more.
 
Read Chapter 8 for important, additional details about exposure. However, 
keep a few things in mind when doing this as a guide for your child:
 
✓ Break the steps down as small as you possibly can. Don’t expect your 
child to master a fear overnight. It takes time. And children need smaller 
steps than adults. For example, if you’re dealing with a fear of dogs, 
don’t expect your child to immediately walk up to and pet a dog on the 
first attempt. Instead, start with pictures and storybooks about dogs. 
Then progress to seeing dogs at a distance, behind an enclosed fence. 
Gradually work up to direct contact, perhaps at a pet store.
 
✓ Expect to see some distress. This is the hard part for parents. No one 
likes to see their kids get upset. But you can’t avoid having your kids feel 
modest distress if you want them to get over their anxiety. Sometimes, 
this part is more than some parents can handle. In those cases, a close 
friend or relative may be willing to pitch in and help. At the same time, 
if your child exhibits extreme anxiety and upset, you need to break the 
task down further or get professional help.
 
✓ Praise your child for any successes. Pay attention to any improvement 
and compliment your child. However, don’t pressure your child by 
saying that this shows what a big boy or girl he or she is.
 
✓ Show patience. Don’t get so worked up that your own emotions spill 
over and frighten your child further. Again, if that starts to happen, stop 
for a while, enlist a friend’s assistance, or seek a professional’s advice.
The following story shows how parents dealt with their son’s sudden anxiety 
about water. Kids frequently become afraid when something unexpected 
happens.
Penny and Stan plan a Caribbean vacation at a resort right on the beach. 
The brochure describes a family-friendly atmosphere. They purchase a 
snorkel and diving mask for their 3-year-old, Benjamin, who enjoys the 
plane ride and looks forward to snorkeling.
When they arrive, the hotel appears as beautiful as promised. The beach 
beckons, and the ocean water promises to be clear. Penny, Stan, and 
Benjamin quickly unpack and make their way down to the beach. They 
walk into the water slowly, delighted by the warm temperature. Suddenly, 
a large wave breaks in front of them and knocks Benjamin over. Benjamin 
opens his mouth in surprise, and saltwater gags him. He cries and runs 
back to the shore, screaming.

296
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
Stan immediately pulls Benjamin back into the water. He continues to 
scream and kick. Penny and Stan spend the rest of the vacation beg-
ging Benjamin to go into the ocean again to no avail. The parents end up 
taking turns babysitting Benjamin while their vacation dream fades.
At home, Benjamin’s fear grows, as untreated fears often do. He fusses 
in the bath, not wanting any water to splash on his face. He won’t even 
consider getting into a swimming pool.
Benjamin’s parents take the lead and guide him through exposure. First, 
on a hot day, they put a rubber, inflated wading pool in the backyard. 
They fill it and model getting in. Eventually, Benjamin shows a little 
interest and joins them in the pool. After he gets more comfortable, 
the parents do a little playful splashing with each other and encourage 
Benjamin to splash them. He doesn’t notice that his own face gets a 
little water on it.
Then his parents suggest that Benjamin put just a part of his face into the 
water. He resists at first, but they encourage him. When he puts his chin 
into the water, they applaud. Stan puts his face entirely under water and 
comes up laughing. He says that Benjamin may not be ready to do that. 
Benjamin proves him wrong. Benjamin and Stan take turns putting their 
faces into the water and splashing each other. What started out as fear 
turns into fun.
The parents provide a wide range of gradually increasing challenges over 
the next several months, including using the mask and snorkel in pools 
of various sizes. Then they go to a freshwater lake and do the same. 
Eventually, they take another vacation to the ocean and gradually expose 
Benjamin to the water there as well.
If Benjamin’s parents had allowed him to play on the beach at the edge of the 
water instead of insisting that he get back in the water immediately, he may 
have been more cooperative. They could have then gradually encouraged 
him to walk in the water while watching for waves. That way, they may have 
been able to enjoy their vacation. They made the mistake of turning a fear 
into a power struggle, which doesn’t work very well with children — or, for 
that matter, with adults.
Relaxing to reduce anxiety
Children benefit from learning to relax, much in the same way that adults do. 
We discussed relaxation methods for adults in Chapters 12 and 13, but kids 
need some slightly different strategies. That’s because they don’t have the 
same attention span as adults.

 Chapter 20: Helping Kids Conquer Anxiety
 
Usually, we suggest teaching kids relaxation on an individual basis rather than 
in groups. Kids in groups tend to get embarrassed. They deal with their 
embarrassment by acting silly and then fail to derive much benefit from the 
exercise. Individual training doesn’t usually create as much embarrassment, 
and keeping kids’ attention is easier.
Breathing relaxation
 
The following directives are intended to teach kids abdominal breathing that 
has been shown to effectively reduce anxiety. Feel free to use your own cre-
ativity to design similar instructions. Say the following to guide your child 
through each step:
 
1. Lie down on the floor and put your hands on your tummy.
 
2. Pretend that your stomach is a big balloon and that you want to fill it 
as full as you can.
 
3. Breathe in and see how big you can make your stomach.
 
4. Now make a whooshing sound, like a balloon losing air, as you slowly 
let the air out. Excellent.
 
5. Let’s do it again.
 
 Breathe in and fill the balloon. Hold it for a moment and then let the air 
out of your balloon ever so slowly as you make whooshing sounds.
Repeat these instructions for eight or ten breaths. Tell your kids to practice 
this exercise daily.
Relaxing muscles
 
An especially effective way of achieving relaxation is through muscle relax-
ation. The following series of directives may help a child relax. Again, feel free 
to use your creativity. Have your child work each muscle group for about ten 
seconds before relaxing. Then relax for about ten seconds. Talk your child 
through the exercises as follows:
 
1. Sit down in this chair, close your eyes, and relax.
 
2. Pretend the floor is trying to rise up and that you have to push it back 
down with your legs and feet.
 
 Push, push, push.
 
3. Okay, now relax your legs and feet.
 
 Notice how nice they feel.
 
4. Oh, oh. The floor is starting to rise again. Push it back down.

298
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
 
5. Good job, now relax.
 
6. Now tighten your stomach muscles.
 
 Make your stomach into a shield of armor, strong like Superman. Hold 
the muscles in.
 
7. Good, now relax.
 
8. One more time; tighten those stomach muscles into steel. Hold it.
 
9. Great, now relax.
 
 See how nice, warm, and relaxed your stomach feels.
 
10. Now, spread your fingers and put your hands together in front of your 
chest. Squeeze your hands together. Push hard and use your arm mus-
cles, too.
 
 Pretend you’re squeezing Play-Doh between your hands and make it as 
squished as you can.
 
11. Okay, now relax. Take a deep breath. Hold it.
 
12. Now let the air out slowly.
 
13. Again, spread your fingers wide, and squish Play-Doh between your 
hands. Hold it.
 
14. Great. Now relax.
 
15. Pretend you’re a turtle. You want to go into your shell. To do that, 
bring your shoulders way up high and try to touch your ears with 
your shoulders. Feel your head go down into your shell. Hold it.
 
16. Okay, now relax.
 
 See how nice, warm, and relaxed your shoulders and neck feel.
 
17. One more time now. Be a turtle and go into your shell. Hold it.
 
18. Good. Now relax.
 
19. Finally, squish your face up like it does when you eat something that 
tastes really, really bad. Squish it up tight. Hold it.
 
20. Okay, now relax. Take a deep breath. Hold it.
 
21. Now let the air out slowly.
 
22. One more time. Squish your face up real tight. Hold it.
 
23. Relax. Good job! See how limp and relaxed your body feels.
 
 When you feel upset or worried, you can do this all by yourself to feel 
better. You don’t have to do all the muscles like we did. You can just do 
what you want to.

 Chapter 20: Helping Kids Conquer Anxiety
Imagining your way to relaxation
One way to help your child relax is through reading books. Before bed, kids 
find stories very relaxing. Reading rids their mind of worries and concerns 
from the day. You can also find various books and tapes specifically designed 
for helping kids relax. Unfortunately, some of the tapes use imagery of beauti-
ful, relaxing scenes that kids may find rather boring.
 
Rather than beautiful scenes of beaches and lakes, kids can relax quite nicely 
to more fanciful scenes that appeal to their sense of fun and joy. The scenes 
don’t need to be about relaxation per se; they just need to be entertaining and 
pleasant. Again, the point is to provide engaging alternatives to worries and 
fears. One great idea comes from one of our clients and that client’s mother. 
You can design your own book with your child. This child, with a little help 
from her mom, wrote and illustrated each page of her own relaxation book as 
in the following excerpt, titled “Imagine Unicorns and Smiling Stars”:
Close your eyes and relax.
Imagine unicorns dancing.
Imagine outer space. Look at the planets spinning and floating.
Imagine smiling stars. See how happy they are.
Imagine blue moons. See the moons smiling.
Imagine nice aliens. They like you.
Imagine spaceships soaring.
Imagine unicorns dancing in outer space with smiling stars, blue moons, 
and friendly aliens in their spaceship soaring.
Now, relax. Dream wonderful dreams.
Exorcizing anxiety through exercise
Exercise burns off excess adrenaline, which fuels anxiety. All kids obviously 
need regular exercise, and studies show that most don’t exercise enough. 
Anxious kids may be reluctant to engage in organized sports. They may feel 
inadequate or even afraid of negative evaluation by others.
 
Yet it may be more important for anxious kids to participate in sports for two 
reasons. First, sports can provide them with important mastery experiences. 
Although they may feel frustrated and upset at first, they usually experience 
considerable pride and a sense of accomplishment as their skills improve. 
Second, aerobic activity directly decreases anxiety.

300
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
 
The challenge is to find a sport that provides your child with the greatest pos-
sible chance of at least modest success. Consider the following activities:
 
✓ Swimming: An individual sport that doesn’t involve balls thrown at your 
head or collisions with other players. Swimmers compete against them-
selves, and many swim teams reward most participants with ribbons, 
whether they come in first or sixth.
 
✓ Track and field: An individual sport that has a wide variety of different 
skill possibilities. Some kids are fast and can run short dashes. Others 
discover that they can develop the endurance to run long distances. Still 
others can throw a shot put.
 
✓ Tennis: A low-contact and relatively safe sport. Good instruction can 
make most kids adequate tennis players.
 
✓ Martial arts: Good for enhancing a sense of competence and confidence. 
Many martial arts instructors have great skill for working with uncoor-
dinated, fearful kids. Almost all kids can experience improvements and 
success with martial arts.
 
✓ Dance: A sport that includes many variations, from ballet to square 
dancing. Musically inclined kids often do quite well with dance classes.
In other words, find something for your kids to do that involves physical 
activity. They can benefit in terms of decreased anxiety, increased confi-
dence, and greater connections with others. Don’t forget to include family 
bike rides, hikes, or walks. Model the benefits of lifelong activity and exercise.
Getting Help from Others
The goals of childhood include learning how to get along with others, learn-
ing self-control, and preparing for adult responsibilities. Children make prog-
ress toward these goals by interacting with friends and family as well as by 
attending school. If anxiety interferes with these activities, then consultation 
and professional treatment may be needed. In other words, if a child can’t 
play, learn, or participate in activities because of worries, it’s time to get 
help.
Who to get help from
We recommend that parents first turn to their child’s medical doctor to make 
sure there are no physical reasons for a child’s anxiety. Certain medications 
prescribed for other conditions can cause a child to feel anxious. The physi-
cian may decide to switch medications first. If the culprit is anxiety, rather 

301
 Chapter 20: Helping Kids Conquer Anxiety
than a drug or physical problem, the medical provider may have recommen-
dations for mental-health providers. The following tips may help you search 
more effectively.
 
✓ Call your health insurance plan to see what type of coverage you have 
for your child’s mental-health care. Your company may have a list of 
providers in your area.
 
✓ Call providers and ask whether they have experience and training in 
treating childhood anxiety. The therapy can seem like play to your child, 
but therapy should be based on an approach that has been shown to 
help children overcome anxiety. We generally recommend practitioners 
trained in cognitive or behavioral strategies because their effectiveness 
has been supported most consistently by research.
 
✓ Make sure the provider you choose has office hours that can accom-
modate several appointments. Although the treatment may be relatively 
brief, don’t expect it to happen in one or two sessions.
 
✓ Ask what state license your provider holds. Don’t seek help from some-
one without a license to practice mental-health counseling. Professionals 
who usually treat children may be clinical psychologists, social workers, 
counselors, or school psychologists.
 
Psychiatrists can also be involved in treating childhood anxiety disorders; 
however, they usually prescribe medication. We recommend that treatment 
for anxiety, especially for children, begin with psychotherapy rather than 
medication. We take this approach because of unknown side effects of long-
term use of medication and the great potential of relapse when medication is 
stopped. In contrast, the new ways of thinking or behaving learned through 
psychotherapy can last a lifetime.
 
If your insurance doesn’t pay for psychotherapy, consider this: A study 
reported in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology (2008) found that the medi-
cal costs of anxious children were almost 21 times higher than those without 
anxiety. Covering effective treatment for anxious children is cost-effective for 
health insurance companies. Your medical provider may be able to advocate 
with your insurance company using this argument. Treating anxiety early can 
save considerable money and suffering in the long run.
What to expect at the first session
Generally, the first session is a time for your child’s therapist to learn about 
the problems your child is having. You can expect lots of questions. Parents 
are almost always invited into the first session to provide information. You 

302
Part V: Helping Others with Anxiety 
may want to prepare for the first appointment beforehand by keeping a jour-
nal of what you’re concerned about. For example, consider taking notes on 
the following questions:
 
✓ What happens? Does your child avoid certain situations? Is anxiety get-
ting in the way of her schoolwork or her play with other children? Is she 
getting bullied at school?
 
✓ When do your child’s symptoms crop up? Is he fine at home with famil-
iar people and afraid at school? Does he get worse when he’s worried 
about a test or when meeting new people? Are there particular times 
when his anxiety seems better or worse?
 
✓ How long have you noticed these symptoms? Have there been any 
changes in the family, such as the birth of a child, death, or divorce? Has 
your child experienced any trauma?
 
✓ Do other members of the family have problems with anxiety? If so, 
what sorts of problems?
 
✓ Has your child experienced any recent health problems or 
hospitalizations?
 
Generally, what a parent or child says to a therapist is held in strict confi-
dence with only a few limitations. One important limit to confidentiality with 
professionals is that they’re required to report suspicions of child abuse. 
Another limit is that they must report cases involving children who appear to 
represent an imminent threat to themselves or other people.
What happens in therapy?
For young children, much of the work is likely to focus on the parents. In other 
words, the therapist spends much of the time teaching the parents things they 
can do to facilitate their child’s progress. This focus doesn’t mean the parents 
caused the problem, but they often can do much to alleviate it.
Older children and teenagers spend more time in discussions with the thera-
pist, and parents’ involvement varies more widely. In either case, you can 
expect the therapist to give tasks to both parents and their kids to be carried 
out in between sessions. You should expect the therapist to discuss what the 
specific goals of the sessions are, as well as detailed plans for getting there. 
However, you shouldn’t expect therapists to reveal details of what is discussed 
in sessions with your child. Kids need to feel safe in revealing whatever they 
want to their therapists. Parents are, however, entitled to progress updates.
More often than not, childhood anxiety can be expected to improve signifi-
cantly (not necessarily resolve entirely) within six months or so of treatment. 
If that doesn’t seem to be happening, discuss it with the therapist and con-
sider getting a second opinion.

Ten Ways to Stop Anxiety Quickly

▶ Talking away your anxiety
▶ Jumping (jacks) into action

S
ometimes you need quick, temporary relief from anxiety. With that in 
mind, this chapter describes ten assorted therapies from our anxiety/
stress reduction first-aid kit. Select one or more when worry and stress start 
to get out of hand.
Breathing Out Your Anxiety
Anxiety makes breathing shallow and rapid. And rapid, shallow breathing has 
a way of increasing anxiety — not a useful cycle. Try this quick, easy-to-learn 
breathing technique to restore a calming pattern of breathing. You can do 
this anytime, anywhere. It really works. Give it a try.
 
1. Inhale deeply through your nose.
 
2. Hold your breath for a few seconds.
 
3. Slowly let your breath out through your lips while making a slight 
sound — hissing, sighing, or whatever.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 for a minimum of ten breaths.
Talking with a Friend
Anxiety is a lonely feeling, and loneliness increases anxiety. Research shows 
that social support helps people deal with almost any type of emotional 
distress. So don’t hesitate to reach out to friends and family. Find a trusted 

306
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
person to confide in. You may think that no one would want to hear about 
your troubles, but we’re not talking about whining and complaining. We’re 
talking about sharing what’s going on with you.
No doubt you would do the same for someone else. You likely know some 
folks who want you to call them in troubled times. If you find yourself without 
friends, call upon a minister, priest, or rabbi. If you have no religious connec-
tions, call a crisis line. You can also see Chapter 23 for signs that you may 
need professional help.
Exercising Aerobically
Anxiety floods the body with adrenaline. Adrenaline, a chemical produced 
by your body, causes your heart to beat faster, your muscles to tighten, and 
various other body sensations that feel distressing. Nothing burns off adrena-
line faster than aerobic exercise. Good examples include jogging; a long, fast 
walk; dancing; rope jumping; and tennis.
Soothing the Body
The most distressing aspect of anxiety is the way that it makes your body 
feel — tense, queasy, racy, and tight. Quick ways to temporarily break 
through the tension include the following:
 
✓ Soaking in a hot bath for a good while.
 
✓ Taking a long, hot shower.
 
✓ Enjoying a 15-minute massage, such as in a chair or on a mat with an 
electronic heating and vibrating massager. Of course, if your budget 
allows for a longer massage performed by a professional masseuse, 
that’s great too!
Drinking Tea
Keep a selection of herbal teas in your cupboard. Certain teas, like chamo-
mile, reportedly have relaxing properties. Stay away from caffeinated teas, 
however, especially if caffeine bothers you.
When you feel anxious, heat up a favorite tea. Hold the cup in your hands and 
breathe in the warm scent. Spend a couple of moments enjoying the comfort 
of sipping tea. Concentrate on the soothing sensation and the luxury of sit-
ting quietly.

307
 Chapter 21: Ten Ways to Stop Anxiety Quickly
Challenging Your Anxious Thinking
The way you think strongly influences the way you feel. Anxious people inevita-
bly think about things in ways that increase their anxiety. One of the best ways 
of dealing with anxiety is to examine the evidence for your anxious thoughts.
First, write down what you’re worried about. Afterwards, ask yourself some 
questions about those thoughts, such as
 
✓ Is this worry truly as awful as I’m thinking it is?
 
✓ Could some evidence contradict my anxious thoughts?
 
✓ In a year, how important will this event be to me?
 
✓ Am I making a dire prediction without any real basis?
After answering these questions, try to write down a more realistic perspec-
tive. See Chapter 5 for discovering more about how to write out your anxious 
thoughts, analyze them for distortions, and replace them with more realistic, 
calmer thoughts.
Listening to Music
Sounds influence the way you feel. Think about it. If you listen to fingernails 
scraping across a blackboard, how do you feel? Most people (us included) 
report that it gives them a creepy, anxious feeling. Just as unpleasant sounds 
jangle the nerves, soothing sounds can calm you.
Select music that you find relaxing. Get comfortable and close your eyes. 
Turn the volume to a comforting level. Relax. Listen.
Finding Distractions
In general, avoiding your anxiety isn’t a good idea. But until you discover 
better ways of dealing with it, sometimes distractions can help. Remember, 
they’re just a temporary bandage and won’t last. However, once in a while, 
distraction helps. Consider the following:
 
✓ A good book
 
✓ A movie
 
✓ Television, mindless as it may be
 
✓ Video games

308
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Having Sex
If you have an available, willing partner, sex is a wonderful way to relax. It 
can certainly take your mind off anxiety! And, like aerobic exercise, it burns 
off adrenaline. What a perfect combination.
 
On the other hand, some anxious people get anxious about their sexual perfor-
mance. If that’s you, don’t try this strategy — at least until you overcome your 
anxiety about this issue. And, if you don’t have an available, willing partner, 
we don’t recommend hiring one.
Staying with the Moment
What are you worried about? Chances are it’s something that hasn’t even 
happened yet and may never occur. The fact is, almost 90 percent of what 
people worry about never actually happens. And if it does occur, it rarely 
ends up being as catastrophic as the worriers predict.
Therefore, we suggest that you focus on the here and now. What are you 
doing? Look around you. Notice how the air feels as it goes in and out your 
nose. Feel your feet and the muscles in your legs as you sit. If you still feel 
anxiety, study it. Notice the various sensations in your body, and realize 
that they won’t kill you. They’ll pass eventually as you observe them. If you 
accept feeling just a bit anxious, the feelings abate more quickly than if you 
tell yourself that you must get rid of them at once. Read Chapter 13 for more 
ideas about mindful acceptance.
Enjoy the moment.

Chapter 22
Ten Ways to Deal with Relapse
In This Chapter
▶ Realizing that anxiety happens
▶ Understanding the process of change
▶ Getting a booster shot
I
f you’re reading this chapter, you’ve probably made some headway with 
your anxiety. Maybe, after all your hard work, you’ve experienced a set-
back, or perhaps you’re worried about one. Not to worry. We have ten ideas 
for you to use when anxiety pops back.
Expecting Anxiety
Perhaps you’ve worked hard to overcome your anxiety, and now your hard 
work has paid off. You’ve beaten it. Congratulations! But alas, one day you 
wake up suddenly with anxiety staring you in the face. You turn it into a 
catastrophe and assume that you’ve failed.
Oh, get real. You’ll never totally annihilate anxiety. That is, until you stop 
breathing. It’s bound to show up from time to time. Expect anxiety. Look for 
its early warning signs. But don’t compound matters by getting anxious about 
your anxiety. If you understand that anxiety happens, you can lessen the 
impact.
Counting the Swallows
The proverb “One swallow doesn’t make a summer” reflects the fact that a 
single sign doesn’t necessarily indicate that something more is inevitable. 
Anxiety has an ebb and flow. Having an anxious episode or two doesn’t mean 
that you’re back to square one. You figured out how to handle some of your 
anxiety, and that knowledge can still help you. You don’t need to start all 

310
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
over again. You do need to move forward and reapply what you practiced. 
Thinking of minor setbacks as catastrophes will only increase your anxiety 
and immobilize your efforts. Regroup, reorganize, and go back at it!
Checking Out Why Anxiety Returned
Minor relapses are a great opportunity to discover what gives you trouble. 
Figure out what events preceded your latest bout of anxiety:
 
✓ Have you had some recent difficulties at work, such as deadlines, pro-
motions, problems with co-workers, or financial setbacks?
 
✓ Have you had recent problems at home, such as divorce, problems with 
a child, or other stressors?
If so, understand that an increase in your anxiety is a natural response and 
likely to be temporary. Use the new information about your anxiety triggers 
to challenge your anxious thinking, as we describe in Chapters 5 and 7.
Seeing a Doctor
If you’ve looked high and low for situations or events that may have set off 
your relapse and can’t come up with anything at all, consider making an 
appointment with your primary care physician. Anxiety can have a number 
of physical causes, such as side effects from prescription medication or over-
the-counter medications and supplements, excessive caffeine, and physical 
problems (see Chapter 3). Don’t try to diagnose yourself. If you experience 
anxiety with absolutely no apparent cause, please get a complete physical 
checkup.
Revisiting What Worked Before
If anxiety creeps back into your life, review the strategies that worked for you 
previously. Some of those techniques may need to become lifelong habits. 
Keep relaxation in your life. Exercise on a regular basis. Review Chapters 5, 6, 
and 7, and do a few of the exercises from time to time.
 
Anxiety isn’t a disease that you can cure with a one-time injection, pill, or sur-
gery. Anxiety is a natural part of life. When it mushrooms to a distressing 
degree, you merely need to reapply your strategies for managing it.

311
 Chapter 22: Ten Ways to Deal with Relapse
Doing Something Different
We’ve presented a variety of strategies for overcoming anxiety. Most likely, 
you’ve picked a few that have felt compatible with your lifestyle. Now con-
sider looking at some ideas you haven’t yet attempted. We urge you to do 
something different. Take a look at the list that follows, and choose one you 
haven’t gotten around to trying yet:
 
✓ Rethinking your anxiety (see Chapters 5, 6, and 7)
 
✓ Facing fear head-on (see Chapter 8)
 
✓ Engaging in relaxation strategies (see Chapter 11)
 
✓ Exercising (see Chapter 10)
If you’ve simply dabbled at one or more of these techniques, pursue it more 
aggressively and see whether it works better that way. Anything in this book 
that you haven’t tried yet is worth considering.
Getting Support
You don’t have to face anxiety relapses alone. Talking with others helps you 
deal with emotional distress. A great source of such support can be found 
in your local newspaper. Most city newspapers list support groups for just 
about everything: various health concerns, emotional problems, relational 
problems, and, of course, anxiety.
 
But what if you live in Pie Town, New Mexico: population 55? Pie Town 
may not have an anxiety support group. But all is not lost. You can go to an 
Internet search engine, such as Google (www.google.com), and enter “chat 
rooms for anxiety.” You’ll find more than enough interesting sources of sup-
port. Try out a few and see whether you can find a group that feels compat-
ible. Millions of people suffer from anxiety, and they have great advice and 
support to offer you. You don’t need to suffer alone.
 
The best support groups give you ideas for coping. Beware of groups that 
seem to encourage whining and complaining.
Considering Booster Sessions
If you’ve seen a professional and later experience an unexpected increase in 
your anxiety, think about calling for a few booster sessions. Your therapist 
isn’t going to think you failed. Usually, a second round of therapy helps and 

312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
doesn’t take as long as the first. In addition, some people like to check in 
every few weeks or months as a kind of prevention. Again, anxiety isn’t a dis-
ease with a single, one-shot cure.
On the other hand, if you’ve never seen a professional and you experience a 
relapse, you should consider it now. If you’ve had previous success on your 
own, you’re likely to improve rapidly with a little assistance.
Looking at the Stages of Change
Any kind of change involves a series of steps or stages. These stages don’t 
necessarily occur in a straight, linear fashion. As we discuss in greater detail 
in Chapter 2, these stages include
 
✓ Pre-contemplation: Not even thinking about change. Obviously, you’re 
not in this stage if you’re reading this book.
 
✓ Contemplation: Thinking about change but not being ready to do some-
thing about it.
 
✓ Preparation: Making plans to do something about your problem.
 
✓ Action: Meeting the problem head-on.
 
✓ Maintenance: Continuing your efforts to deal with your problem.
 
✓ Termination: Only a lucky few reach this point; you no longer even have 
to think about your problem.
Relapse can occur during any of these stages. For example, you may move 
back from action to contemplation or even pre-contemplation. Just remem-
ber, it’s normal. Stepping back for a while doesn’t mean that you can’t gather 
the resources to make another run at the problem. Most people who succeed 
have to try a number of times before they get there.
Accepting Anxiety
With this tip, we come full circle — back to the top of the list: Anxiety hap-
pens. It will return. Welcome it with open arms. It means that you’re still 
alive! Appreciate the positive aspects. Anxiety tells you to pay attention to 
what’s going on around you. Go with the flow.
We’re not suggesting that you need to feel horrendous amounts of anxiety, 
but a little anxiety is unavoidable. And anxiety, when not overwhelming, may 
help mobilize your resources during difficult challenges.

Chapter 23
Ten Signs That You Need 
Professional Help
In This Chapter
▶ Contemplating suicide
▶ Slogging through work troubles
▶ Saying “No” to excessive drug and alcohol use
S
ome people find that self-help is all they need. They read about good 
ways of dealing with their anxiety, and then they apply what they’ve dis-
covered. Voilà! Their anxiety gradually fades to a manageable level.
However, no self-help book is intended to completely replace professional 
help. And anxiety sometimes requires the assistance of a professional, just 
like complicated tax matters may call for a certified public accountant or 
deciding to draw up a will may send you to an attorney. We hope you under-
stand that seeking a mental-health professional’s assistance is a reasonable 
choice, not a sign of weakness.
This chapter tells you how to know whether you should consider profes-
sional assistance for yourself or someone you care about. It’s not always an 
obvious decision, so we give you a list of indicators. And if you still aren’t 
sure, you can always talk with your primary care doctor, who should be able 
to help you decide.
Having Suicidal Thoughts or Plans
If you find yourself thinking about harming yourself, get help now. Take these 
thoughts very seriously. Call the national suicide hotline at 1-800-SUICIDE 
(1-800-784-2433). If your thoughts become overwhelming, call 911 and get to 
an emergency room. Help is available. And when you do access professional 
help, be honest about your thoughts; hold nothing back. A professional can 
help gather other options and solutions that seem out of reach when some-
one is feeling tremendously anxious or depressed.

314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Feeling Hopeless
From time to time, everyone feels defeated. But if you begin to feel hopeless 
about getting better, thinking that the future looks bleak and you can’t do 
much to change it, get professional help. Feelings of hopelessness put you at 
greater risk for suicide. You need to know that you can feel better. Let others 
help you.
Handling Anxiety and Depression
You may be experiencing depression mixed with anxiety if you find yourself 
having some of the following symptoms:
 
✓ Feeling sad most of the day
 
✓ Losing interest or pleasure in activities
 
✓ Change in weight
 
✓ Changes in your sleep patterns and habits
 
✓ Decreased interest in sex
 
✓ Feeling keyed up or slowed down
 
✓ Feeling worthless
 
✓ Feeling excessively guilty
 
✓ Poor concentration
 
✓ Thoughts of death
If you do have anxiety and depression, seek professional help. Depression 
is a treatable condition. Having the energy to fight both can be hard. You 
may also want to pick up a copy of our Anxiety and Depression Workbook For 
Dummies (Wiley).
Trying to No Avail
Perhaps you’ve read this book and given the recommendations your best 
shot at overcoming anxiety, but for whatever reason, they just haven’t 
worked. That’s okay. Don’t get more anxious because you didn’t get rid of 

315

worry and stress. Something else may be going on. Get an experienced men-
tal-health professional to help you figure out the next step.
Struggling at Home
You’re anxious. The anxiety causes you to be irritable, jumpy, and upset. You 
hold it together at work and with strangers, but you take it out on the people 
you care about most, your family. Then you feel guilty, which increases your 
anxiety. If this sounds like you, a professional may help you decrease the ten-
sion at home and ease the pathway to finding peace.
Dealing with Major Problems at Work
Maybe you have no one at home to take out your anxiety on, or perhaps 
home is the haven away from stress. If that’s the case, work stress may over-
whelm you. If you find your anxiety exploding at work, consider professional 
help.
First, anxiety sometimes causes irritability and moodiness with co-workers or 
bosses; such behavior can cause plenty of trouble. Anxiety can also rob you 
of your short-term memory, make it difficult to focus, or make decisions feel 
overwhelming. So if anxiety affects your job performance, get help before you 
hit the unemployment line.
On the other hand, if you’re out of work, take a look at Chapter 14 for ideas.
Suffering from Severe Obsessions 
or Compulsions
Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can be serious. See Chapter 2 for more 
information about OCD. The problem is that people with the disorder often 
don’t seek help until their lives are taken over by unwanted thoughts or 
repetitive actions. Most people with OCD need professional help. If you or 
someone you love has more than mild OCD, get professional help. Also, 
consider reading Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder For Dummies by yours truly 
(Wiley).

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Understanding Post-Traumatic 
Stress Disorder
You feel agitated and keyed up. Were you also exposed to a traumatic event 
that resulted as follows?
 
✓ At the time, you felt helpless and afraid.
 
✓ Later, you try not to think about it.
 
✓ In spite of your efforts not to think about it, the thoughts and images 
keep on popping up.
If so, you may have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). See Chapter 2 for a 
complete description of PTSD. The treatment of PTSD is probably best done 
by an experienced professional. Many people with PTSD try to tough it out 
and live life less fully because of their stubbornness.
Going through Sleepless Nights
Is anxiety keeping you awake? That’s quite common. If your sleep doesn’t 
improve after working on your anxiety awhile, be sure to read Chapter 10 
about sleep. Too many sleepless nights make it hard to function and more 
difficult to help yourself in the fight against anxiety. If you sleep poorly night 
after night and awaken tired, check it out with a professional. You may be 
experiencing depression along with anxiety.
Getting High
Sure, a beer or three can seemingly soothe the soul, but excessive drinking 
or drug abuse is a common problem among those with anxiety disorders. It 
makes sense; anxious feelings are uncomfortable. What begins as an innocent 
attempt at feeling better can become another big problem later on. If you find 
yourself consuming too much alcohol or another drug to calm your feelings, 
get professional help before the crutch turns into an addiction.

 Chapter 23: Ten Signs That You Need Professional Help
Finding Help
In the days of high-cost healthcare, you may not always have as much free-
dom to consult any professional you want. However, whether you receive a 
restricted list of professionals from your insurance company or not, it’s still a 
good idea to check out one or more of the following:
 
✓ Ask the insurance company or the state licensing board for the specific 
profession or license of the referred professional.
 
✓ Ask your friends if they know of someone whom they had a good experi-
ence with.
 
✓ Ask your primary care doctor. Family physicians usually have a good 
idea about excellent referrals for various types of problems.
 
✓ Talk to the professional before making an appointment. Ask about his 
experience with treating anxiety and what approach he takes. Ask about 
whether you’ll receive a scientifically verified approach for dealing with 
anxiety.
 
✓ Call the psychology department of your local college or university. 
Sometimes they have referral lists.
 
✓ Call or use a search engine on the Web to find your state psychological, 
psychiatric, or counseling association. Or check out national consumer 
organizations. (See the appendix in the back of this book for more 
information.)

Accessing Web Sites to Discover 
More about Anxiety
 
Type the word “anxiety” into a search engine, and literally thousands of sites 
pop up. Be careful. The Web is full of unscrupulous sales pitches and misin-
formation. Be especially cautious about official-sounding organizations that 
promote materials for sale. Don’t be fooled by instant cures for anxiety.
 
Many Web forums host chat rooms for persons with anxiety concerns. Feel 
free to access them for support. At the same time, realize that you don’t know 
who’s sitting on the other end. They may be uneducated about anxiety or, 
worse, trying to take advantage of a person in distress. Don’t believe every-
thing you read.
Here’s a list of a variety of legitimate Web sites that don’t sell snake oil:
 
✓ The Academy of Cognitive Therapy (www.academyofct.org) is a 
group that certifies experts in the field of cognitive therapy. They pro-
mote evidence-based treatment and maintain a list of certified mental-
health professionals through the world.
 
✓ The American Psychiatric Association (www.psych.org/public_
info) has information for the public about anxiety and other mental 
disorders.
 
✓ The American Psychological Association (www.apa.org/pubinfo) 
provides information to the public about treatment and interesting facts 
about anxiety and other emotional disorders.
 
✓ The Anxiety Disorders Association of America (www.adaa.org) lists 
self-help groups across the United States. They also display a variety of 
anxiety screening tools for self-assessment. On their site you can find an 
online newsletter and a message board.

322
Overcoming Anxiety For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
✓ The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies (www.abct.
org) is a large professional organization that focuses on research-
validated treatment approaches for people with emotional disorders. 
We often refer people to their extensive list of qualified therapists.
 
✓ The International OCD Foundation (www.ocfoundation.org) has 
an annual conference and provides considerable information about the 
assessment and treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. It also has 
a message board and provides an opportunity to ask experts questions.
 
✓ The National Alliance on Mental Illness (www.nami.org) is a won-
derful organization that serves as an advocate for people and families 
affected by mental disorders. Information is available about causes, 
prevalence, and treatments of disorders for children and adults. This 
group also offers support groups across the country.
 
✓ The National Association of School Psychologists (www.nasponline.
org) maintains a site with information and fact sheets for parents and 
teachers.
 
✓ The National Institute of Mental Health (www.nimh.nih.gov) reports 
on research about a wide variety of mental-health issues. It also has 
an array of educational materials on anxiety. It provides resources for 
researchers and practitioners in the field.
 
✓ PsychCentral (www.psychcentral.com) has an abundance of 
psychology-related resources, blogs, and free information. We happen 
to write a blog called “Anxiety & OCD Exposed” on this site. Feel free to 
send us feedback or ask questions through this Web site.
 
✓ WebMD (www.webmd.com) provides a vast array of information about 
both physical and mental-health issues, including information about psy-
chological treatments, drug therapy, and prevention.
