 Foreword 
 As Robin S. Sharma once said, “What gets measured gets improved.” In the industrial space, the process of 
continuous improvement is founded on this concept. There are always new and challenging ways to drive 
improvements in processes and workflows, but understanding their priority, cost, and impact on the rest 
of the system isn’t always easy. It comes down to tracking the resources — people and machines — that are 
performing the work and then managing any variations that arise from the standard process. People are 
needed at the operations level to deal with variations, and there’s no shortage of machine tools to provide 
technical feedback on how well a process is running. In fact, these tools have been refined so much that 
one can easily apply the concepts of manufacturing-process improvement to improving things in one’s own 
daily life. 
 Take the example of commuting to work in the morning rush and trying to avoid traffic. I might start the 
process by planning out a route via a GPS or an online maps website and noting the expected duration of 
the trip. Then after taking the route, I can compare the actual time to the planned time, and also the quality 
of my experience during the commute. From there, I may try alternate routes depending on the given time 
of day or things like weather, construction, annoying intersections, and so forth. This is essentially what the 
Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) metric is measuring, but it is applied specifically to manufacturing 
processes. While OEE isn’t a singularly perfect metric and can’t be looked at in a vacuum, it does cover many 
scenarios, and it can be a tool that provides guidance to an overarching continuous-improvement strategy 
like Short Interval Control. It can be a tool with which your organization can determine where the industrial 
engineering budget is spent. 
 For those of you who have been part of the SAP MII community from the start, you know that we are 
continually innovating as a collective group, building off of the success of one, or many, customers and 
using these stories as a mechanism by which to grow new and innovative solutions. Without this kind of 
ecosystem and sharing of stories we would be much further behind than we are today. We owe a great deal 
of our success in this space to key experts in the MII field, a few of whom have authored this book — Dipankar 
Saha, Mahalakshmi Syamsunder, and Sumanta Chakraborty. Dipankar has a long and rich history with the 
MII product, having co-authored a previous book on MII, and is very active in the SAP Community Network 
(SCN) for MII, writing many notable and forward-looking blogs and documents on MII. Mahalakshmi is a 
leading expert on the SAP Manufacturing Suite and has many online documented resources and successes 
in the automation and performance-management arena. Last, but certainly not least, is Sumanta, whom I 
have had the pleasure of working with at SAP for many years now, where he is the lead Product Owner for 
the development of the SAP OEE solution. His cool and personable manner of working through problems 
behind the scenes and in front of customers has proven how valuable a resource he is to our organization, as 
people have been asking for an OEE solution for many years and his work has made that a reality for them.

 The efforts of those mentioned, along with the efforts of the countless others who have contributed to 
knowledge sharing and innovation, are the lifeblood of what enables this community to thrive. I am very 
blessed to be part of it and am truly in awe of the work done all around the globe to further promote effective 
and organized manufacturing operations. I am looking forward to the next step in innovation. We have many 
ideas and many contributors, and this is a true testament to the power of our community and the creative 
thinkers who make it up.

 Acknowledgments 
 While I have been engrossed with the workings of manufacturing performance management using SAP 
OEE, I did not think it possible I would one day pen a book on the subject. The idea of writing this book for 
the gainful academic and pragmatic benefit of IT professionals and aspiring students of this amazing and 
expanding body of knowledge germinated around February 2015. 
 Even as the premonition of penning this book struck and convinced my imaginations, I could not have 
possibly conceived the book as you read it without support and inspiration from many quarters. Firstly, 
to my parents who from earthly origins and indefatigable zeal raised me and bestowed upon me enviable 
qualities of scientific inquiry and humane values. My father, P. Subramanian, and mother, S. Rajakumari, 
have been invaluably supportive and encouraging in their love and affection for me. I offer my infinite 
salutations at their lotus feet with a prayer of continuance of their infinite blessings and inexhaustible love 
and affection for me. 
 Secondly, my husband, Syamsunder, whom I exclusively adore as his abiding wife. I cannot imagine 
the toil of my effort bearing fruition without his unstinting support, feedback, and help on several drafts 
of this volume. Late nights, mornings with me not having the rise of the splendid sun for the better part of 
the year, and totalitarian reclusiveness from societal obligations are some among many occasions when 
he assumed the additional charge of our family and household. Many thanks for your understanding and 
encouragement through this exciting journey from the germination of an idea to a paginated book hopefully 
worthy of readership. Vedesh Sheetal, the apple of my eye, my son, only six years of age, broke all known 
conventions of hyperactivity associated with him to knowingly or otherwise offer his approval of support for 
this endeavor. I shall more than make up lost time and motherly affection on him after sharing this body of 
knowledge with you. 
 Lastly, I dedicate this book, my humble offering of gratitude, to my gurus in education and the industry, 
and to my current manager, Dipankar Saha, who had the trust in making me an author. I do wish you will 
benefit from the book, and I look forward to your patronage in future editions and books I plan to pen on 
information technology.
 — Mahalakshmi Syamsunder 
 Product development around manufacturing and the supply chain has always been my area of expertise. 
But writing a book to articulate my knowledge and expertise was always a challenge and additional hard 
work. While taking up such a challenge, I cannot forget the two most affectionate people of my life, 
my parents, who have brought me up and taught me that there is no substitute for hard work. My dad, 
Bimal Chakraborty, and my mom, Anurupa Chakraborty, along with my brother, Subhro Chakraborty, 
have been the people who have made me the person who I am today. There are also three beautiful lives 
at home, my loving wife, Sampa, and two little daughters, Soumi and Ishani, who are always waiting for 
me to be with them when I’m at home. Needless to say, writing a book is always an additional effort and it 
takes up personal time that is usually reserved for them. I’m really grateful for their tremendous support 
and encouragement to finish my work on time. Last but not least, building a successful SAP OEE product 
that helps our customers manage manufacturing performance would have never been possible without an

excellent SAP OEE development team that SAP Labs India has provided me. Finally, I’d like to thank the SAP 
manufacturing community of customers, consultants, and practitioners who have continuously collaborated 
with us to build the product and will ideally take this product forward.

 Writing a book is not an easy task, and behind the scenes there are always many who contribute selflessly to 
make the book a success. We’d like to take this opportunity to thank all those without whose help this book 
would not have seen the light of the day. 
 First of all we would like to thank Rita Fernando, Celestin Suresh, John and Matthew Moodie, our 
editors for this book. Rather than being just editors, they acted as our guide and mentors and immensely 
helped to make the content perfect, so that you, our readers, get a product of high quality. 
 We’d like to thank our families, without whose help and constant support this endeavor would have 
been just a dream. They tolerated us and provided constant support when we burned much midnight oil 
writing the book. 
 We are grateful to the SAP OEE product development team at SAP Labs India, namely Anil Kumar Tota, 
M Saurabh Sharma, Prayas Das, Pruthvi Kumar. L, Sandip Jha, Sulaksh Gupta, and Tarun Rawal, who helped 
us all through reviewing the book content despite their busy schedules and providing help and support 
whenever required. We’d also like to thank Nalini B A, Rajesh Kamath, Sailaja Vadlamudi, Sandhya Srinivas, 
Shalini Kohli, Shilpa Maniyar, Sriram Kannan, and Yamini Priya Bhavirishetty from SAP Labs and Suman 
Mukherjee, who have provided their support in reviewing the content at different points in time. 
 We’d like to thank Kalpati Srinivas, Sudipta Mukherjee, Chandan Jash, Swapna Mukherjee, Moumita 
De, Pallavi Shah, Sudipta Chakraborty, and Laboni Bhowmik of IBM, who have enriched the content at every 
step. Despite being our friends and colleagues, they did not for a moment hesitate to constructively criticize 
the content when required and also helped us with facts, figures, and other technical suggestions that ensure 
a much more fulfilling experience for you, the reader. 
 We’d also like to thank G Venkatraghavan, Somnath Dey, Subhabrata Ganguly, Anup K Ghosh, 
Sauti Sen, and Asidhara Lahiri of the IBM leadership team and Juergen Weiner, Veronika Schmid-Lutz, 
Dharmendra Kumar, Rajeev Kansal and Chethak T K from SAP leadership team, without whose 
encouragement and support the process of writing this book would not have been as smooth as it was. 
 Last but not least, we’d like to thank the SAP Community Network, without which we would not 
been able to collaborate and learn so much, and where we always find help whenever required from the 
community of developers, users, and experts. We owe you.

 Introduction 
 SAP Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is a manufacturing performance-management solution from 
SAP used for managing and measuring execution and performance in manufacturing industries. This 
book is intended to provide a thorough guide for using and customizing SAP OEE. It is the product of many 
months of effort, and we bring together our knowledge and expertise in this topic with the lessons we have 
learned through several SAP OEE implementations. We sincerely hope that, as the first book on the topic, 
this will be a useful resource for all those who intend to use and implement SAP OEE. 
 Target Audience 
 This book is intended for consultants, developers, and users implementing and using SAP OEE.  
 Structure of this Book 
 This book is organized into nine chapters as follows: 
 Chapter   1 explains manufacturing performance management and how different KPIs are used to 
measure it. It also explains the OEE standard and its calculation, as well as the importance of enterprise to 
manufacturing execution systems’ integration for data collection and analysis. 
 Chapter   2  explains the OEE solution as delivered on the SAP MII platform along with its architecture 
and different components of the solution. In addition it covers the overall usage and benefits of the solution. 
 Chapter   3  explains the add-on component for SAP OEE available in SAP ERP and how to configure 
the master data, configuration data, and transactional data required for SAP OEE. It also reviews the 
configurations required in SAP ERP to transfer the data to SAP MII for setting up OEE. 
 Chapter   4  explains the OEEINT component available in SAP MII to transfer OEE messages 
bi-directionally, how to do the basic configurations in MII for OEE, and how to transfer the different 
messages from SAP ERP to MII for OEE and then how to monitor them in MII. 
 Chapter   5  explains the configurations required in SAP MII for OEE along with the user roles,

 CHAPTER 1  
 Manufacturing Performance 
Management: An Overview 
 This chapter will explain manufacturing performance management and how it is used to measure and 
monitor the performance of assets and processes involved in manufacturing execution. It will also look at 
how industry would be affected without the measuring process in place. In addition, it will explain how to 
optimize manufacturing performance by defining and measuring the metrics. 
 Manufacturing companies, like any other business in today’s world, face tremendous pressure to 
optimize operational costs, increase resource utilization, and improve product quality. With competitive 
markets and globalization, common factors for almost every industry, optimizing and improving processes 
and costs is the only way to survive. To enable optimization and improvement of quality, the first step is to 
measure the operational parameters so that suitable actions can be taken to quickly improve them. 
 Manufacturing performance management is the method by which the operational performance of 
manufacturing execution — such as resource utilization and availability, rate of production, and first-pass 
quality of the produced product — can be measured and analyzed to understand the gaps and scope of 
improvements. Without having a manufacturing performance-management practice in place it is almost 
impossible for a manufacturing business to survive, as the planners and decision makers cannot understand 
the scope of needed improvements and opportunities for optimization. 
 Measuring performance needs to ensure the collection of operational and planning data from different 
heterogeneous sources and then must analyze them to understand the impact. First of all, it requires a 
solution via which the data from various sources can be accumulated in a single place by integrating with 
different types of systems and applications that generate the data at various granularity levels. The planning 
data are typically available in the ERP system at the corporate domain, whereas most of the operational 
data are available at the plant sites in manufacturing execution systems, with the plant historian, in legacy 
databases and applications, or manually collected on paper. Once the data are accumulated from different 
data sources, it needs to be aggregated and analyzed to generate meaningful metrics from it. 
 Therefore, to implement manufacturing performance management, a solution is required that can 
enable the collection, aggregation, and analysis of manufacturing planning and operational data as well as 
provide meaningful insight so as to optimize manufacturing operations. 
 Need for KPIs to Optimize Manufacturing Performance 
 This section will explain the need for  key performance indicators (KPIs)   to measure, monitor, and analyze 
manufacturing and production performance, along with how to benchmark the process performance 
using KPIs. We will also look at how OEE and other KPIs help in capturing production losses and achieving 
optimal production performance. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT: AN OVERVIEW
2
 Any growing or established business needs to be closely and carefully managed to ensure the success 
of new investment decisions and expansion plans, and to sustain their success and their competitive 
advantage. KPIs are at the heart of any system of performance measurement and target setting. When 
properly used, they are one of the most powerful management tools available to a business. KPIs provide a 
definitive measure for production and resources performance. 
 Let’s take an example of a consumer products manufacturing company where food products are 
manufactured and packaged in semi-automated production lines. There are machines in the production 
line, such as a filler or a palletizer, that are bottleneck machines — i.e., they are critical and mandatory work 
centers in the processing flow path. They have a limited capacity, which affects the capacity of the overall 
production line. The downtimes for the bottleneck machines cause production delays. The planners and 
other stakeholders want to know the availability of the machines compared to their planned availability. The 
availability of the machines varies over time due to different factors, such as mechanical faults, unavailability 
of raw materials, human errors, and breaks, which need to be captured with corresponding reason codes. 
 Also, there are other metrics that the plant management and planner need to monitor — such as the 
material yield for orders, shifts and production lines, quality (acceptable/good quality yield versus planned 
yield), and rate of production — that help in understanding the bottlenecks and scope of optimization and 
improvements. KPIs are measurable quantities on the time scale, as well as on other dimensions. For 
example, the machine availability KPI can be based on the time when the machine is available, calculated 
for each hour, each eight hours (a shift), or each day, factoring in its downtime and planned availability. 
The KPI can also be measured for each product being produced on it or each operator who operates it. In 
this example, apart from the time dimensions, other dimensions for the availability KPI are product and 
operator, as KPI may vary for different products and operators for various reasons. In addition, each KPI 
has a target value, which is the threshold limit for the measure of the specific KPI. The KPIs can be positive, 
negative, or bi-directional depending on whether the KPI measure value tends to exceed the target (positive) 
or to come in below the target (negative). When it is bi-directional it can exceed or be below the target value 
depending on certain conditions. For example, power consumption can be bi-directional KPI, whereas 
the availability and efficiency of a machine are positive KPI; machine downtime and safety incidents are 
examples of negative KPI. 
 To measure the performance of manufacturing process and resources it is necessary to define the 
KPIs and measure them continuously to ensure the process is stable and optimized. KPIs are defined 
as quantifiable factors that are clearly linked to the drivers of business success. For any manufacturing 
company, certain KPIs are defined with specific targets that need to be achieved or exceeded (or to not be 
exceeded) based on their type. The KPIs used in manufacturing industries vary depending on the industry 
type and manufacturing process. 
 Some of the common KPIs used by manufacturers, broken down by business goals, are as follows:
• 
 Improve Quality 
 Yield Count (Good or Bad) relates to the measure of the total number of units 
of product produced in a production line for a production run, shift, or day. 
It provides a basic indicator of the production personnel and/or the machine 
efficiency, as well as whether the organization targets for production efficiency 
are being met. 
 Rejection Ratio measures the scrap quantity versus the total quantity of units 
produced in a production line for a certain timeframe. It indicates the quality of 
the production process; a lower value is better for maximizing profit. 
 Production Rate provides the speed at which the product is produced, i.e., total 
quantity produced in a given timeframe. The speed of machines varies, and it is 
important to maintain the optimized rate, as a too-high rate may affect quality 
and a too-slow rate may affect profitability. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT: AN OVERVIEW

• 
 Reduce Inventory 
 WIP Inventory/Turns is a commonly used ratio calculation to measure the 
efficient use of inventory materials. It is calculated by dividing the cost of goods 
sold by the average inventory used to produce those goods. 
• 
 Reduce Machine Downtime 
 Machine Downtime refers to the time during which a machine or production 
line is not available for operation. It can be either the result of a breakdown or 
simply a machine changeover, and is considered one of the most important KPI 
metrics to track in manufacturing industries. Machine unavailability or non-
operation time affects the productivity and profitability of the organization. 
Tracking downtime typically requires assigning a “reason code” to the event, so 
that the most pertinent ones can be tracked. 
• 
 Improve Efficiency 
 Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is a multi-dimensional metric that 
provides an overall measure of the effectiveness and utilization of a machine or 
production line; this is determined by multiplying availability by performance 
and quality. This is one of the most important KPIs for any manufacturing 
company. Production managers always want OEE values to increase, because 
this indicates more efficient utilization of available personnel and machinery. 
 Takt Time measures the amount of time, or cycle time, for the completion of a 
specific task. This could be the time it takes to produce a product, but it more 
likely relates to the cycle time of specific operations. This helps to determine 
where the constraints or bottlenecks are within a process. 
 Time to Make Changeovers measures the speed or time it takes to switch a 
manufacturing line from making one product over to making a different product. 
 There are many other KPIs being used by different industries based on their manufacturing processes. 
Also, most KPI targets or desired ranges are benchmarked for specific industries and processes, which the 
manufacturers tend to follow. As there are multiple factors to be managed in the manufacturing process, it is 
essential to measure them as KPIs to ensure the performance is always on track.  
 Benchmarking and Target Setting 
  Benchmarking  is a valuable way of improving and understanding business performance and potential. 
Benchmarking can be done by making comparisons with other businesses or internally within the business. 
A key driver of any business is the focus area of benchmarking. 
 For example, a manufacturing company can set its KPI targets (Quality, Customer Satisfaction, and so 
on) as a benchmark based on its counterpart running a similar successful business. 
 Comparing absenteeism rates or operator efficiency between similar departments may enable the 
business to spread good working practices from the best performing areas of your business to lower 
performing areas. 
 Target setting involves setting performance targets in the key areas that drive the business performance. 
Performance targets are a powerful management tool that can help deliver the kind of strategic changes that 
many growing businesses need to make. The top-level objectives of a strategic plan can be implemented 
through departmental goals, and setting targets based on KPIs is an ideal way of doing this. 
 KPI Targets should be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT: AN OVERVIEW

 KPIs provide a measure of productivity as well as of the losses, depending on their definition. It is 
critical for manufacturing businesses to keep track of losses such as time loss, material loss, productivity loss, 
and so forth, which provides important information on how to optimize the production process. 
 To summarize, it is important to define KPIs, set targets based on the manufacturing process, and 
continuously measure and track them so as to understand bottlenecks and how to increase efficiency, which 
in turn helps in increasing the profitability of the business.  
 OEE Standard and Its Calculations 
 This section will explain the definition of  OEE , different types of losses, methods of loss capture, calculation 
of factors associated with OEE calculation that are followed as a standard approach, and benefits of OEE. 
 Any manufacturing process involves throughput from machines, and different types of losses are 
encountered in the production process. The losses are due to the unreliability of the machines and the 
operators as well as to other external factors, such as material or operational issues. To determine the 
production process’ efficiency, it is important to understand and track the losses occurring. The losses in can 
be of broadly three types:
• 
 Availability loss 
• 
 Time loss for availability of resources or machines due to breakdowns or 
scheduled and unscheduled breaks 
• 
 Loss due to setup, changeover process, material and labor shortages, etc.     
• 
 Speed loss 
• 
 Loss in production due to reduced speed or increased cycle time due to 
machine, material, or human issues 
• 
 Loss due to idling and minor stops that are not part of regular maintenance 
• 
 Quality loss 
• 
 Material loss due to quality issues like rejects during startup, improper setup, etc.       
 To measure and track these, a KPI is required through which all the possible losses can be measured. 
Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is one such KPI that can be used to measure and track performance 
efficiency by capturing the losses. OEE is an essential metric and basic methodology for manufacturers 
pursuing a “lean” manufacturing strategy — that is “zero waste” in their “value streams.” 
 For many manufacturing companies OEE is becoming a very important and mandatory KPI with which 
to measure and track. OEE is defined as the effectiveness of a machine or production line that is used for the 
 manufacturing process ; it uses the following formula:  Availability x Performance x Quality 
 Where:
• 
 Availability (of machine) = net operating time/total planned operating time
• 
 Net operating time = total operating time - downtimes  
• 
 Total operating time is the shift duration based on the factory calendar 
• 
 Performance = actual rate of production/planned rate of production
• 
 Actual rate of production = cycle time = total quantity produced/total time taken  
• 
 Planned rate of production = Nominal or Rated speed of production. 
E.g., 100kg/min or 1000 pieces/hr. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT: AN OVERVIEW
5
• 
 Quality = units of good quality produced/total units produced
• 
 Units of good quality = total units of produced – total units of rejected 
 As is evident from the above formulas, OEE targets three distinct points of loss that can be potential 
areas of improvement for the manufacturing process. To measure and calculate OEE KPI, you must capture 
certain information from the production process. This information can be collected directly from the 
manufacturing automation system, if available, or can be manually collected as well. The typical  data that 
needs to be collected are as follows:
• 
 Downtimes for the resource/production line, with reason code; i.e., start and 
end time of the machine downtimes, from which the downtime duration can 
be calculated 
• 
 Total yield of the machine/production line in a specific time window; 
e.g., shift or hour 
• 
 Total yield quantity not conforming to first-pass quality. This includes scrap and 
waste as well as reworked material quantity that does not pass the quality tests the 
first time 
 The  preceding parameters need to be captured continuously, and with that information the OEE KPI 
can be calculated periodically for specific time periods, which provides an indication of the losses and 
the effectiveness of the manufacturing process. Typically, for most of the manufacturing industries, 
85 percent OEE is considered a benchmark for a minimum target. 
 Once the OEE KPIs are  calculated and analyzed, they can be drilled down to find out the root cause of a 
low OEE value and to understand the actual points where the losses are occurring, which can then possibly 
be optimized. OEE is measured for resource or machines used in the manufacturing execution process, 
usually the bottleneck ones that control the throughput of the process. Typically in a filling and packing line, 
the filler machine is considered the bottleneck in some cases, and so it may be the most critical resource for 
that production line. 
 To measure and calculate the OEE, it is necessary to continuously collect the downtimes, material 
loss, and rate of production for that resource. The data can be collected automatically, if it is an automated 
production line with a Plant Historian system or Manufacturing Execution system capturing the pertinent 
information. This is done via sensors connected to the machines. Otherwise, the production operator must 
capture the operational data manually for each production run or shift — for example, how long the machine 
was idle or down, quantity of material produced, and scrapped or reworked material, as well as the rate of 
production — based on which the OEE KPI can be calculated. 
 The machine downtimes measured in OEE are of various types, as shown in Figure  1-1 . The plant 
operating time is based on the factory calendar, which is the total time the factory operations are running. 
This calendar accounts for planned downtime for scheduled maintenance, scheduled breaks, and idle time 
due to lack of production plan. The rest of the time is considered as the planned production time based on 
the production plan. The planned production time versus the planned downtime and idle time measures 
the utilization of the machine, i.e., how much the resource is used for production. 
 Regarding the planned production time, the major loss happens due to unplanned breakdowns 
and downtimes of the machines, which when deducted from the planned production time provides the 
machine’s productive time, or total operating time. This measures the availability of the resource. 
 There may be some delays or an inconsistent speed of production due to machine or human factors, 
which result in speed loss and a reduction in the machine’s productive time; this gives a measure of the 
performance of the resource. 
 Finally, out of the net operating time, some of the yield may be scrap, waste, or rework, and the time 
used for producing good quality product is considered to be the fully productive time. This provides the 
measure of the quality KPI of the resource.

 Losses that are otherwise not easily visible and accountable can be highlighted by measuring OEE. 
 Figure  1-2  explains a sample OEE calculation for a resource based on the production data in a shift.

CHAPTER 1 ■ MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT: AN OVERVIEW

 By analyzing the OEE KPI, the following benefits can be achieved in the  production process  : 
 Efficient and effective usage of existing equipment and facilities by 
• 
 reducing planned downtimes due to scheduled maintenance, breaks, material 
shortages, and so on, thus increasing the machine utilization; and by  
• 
 minimizing machine breakdowns and unplanned downtimes to increase availability. 
 Real-time visibility on the shop floor production, which aids in 
• 
 eliminating the factors for speed or production-rate loss —  i.e., minor stops and 
misfeeds — that do not require maintenance, thus increasing performance;  
• 
 understanding the factors for quality loss so as to minimize the scrap, waste, and 
rework quantities; 
• 
 quantifying plant/line/machine performance; and  
• 
 analyzing recurring production losses and their sources, and coming up with ways to 
improve. 
 OEE acts as a stepping stone for the manufacturer to achieve world class production. It enables the 
manufacturer to realize financial benefits in terms of reduced downtime costs, repair costs, and quality costs 
and increased labor efficiency and productivity, which ultimately leads to increased production capability. 
 To summarize, OEE KPI provides a clear and useful measure of the performance and effectiveness 
of the manufacturing process and resources and provides a mechanism by which the process can be 
optimized. It does this by helping the manufacturer understand the main points of loss so they can take 
action to reduce them. 
 The Need for an Effective Operator Interface for 
Data Collection 
 This section will explain how important it is to have an effective operator  interface in place before 
introducing a performance-management system on the manufacturing shop floor. It will explain the 
different aspects of an effective shop floor operator interface. 
 Any shop floor performance-improvement program needs some amount of data to be collected via 
manual interaction. Hence it is important to involve the shop floor operators and provide them with a user 
interface that they can use effectively. The basic purpose of an operator on the shop floor is to produce, to 
make. His primary duty is to operate the machines and to take care of them so that they do not break down. 
If a breakdown happens, his job is to get it running again or to initiate maintenance to repair it. Any other 
documentation task or data entry on a computer is seen as a secondary activity for him. Hence, an operator 
interface that needs to be used by the shop floor as part of the manufacturing performance-management 
solution needs to have features such as the following:
• 
 The operator interface should add value, not another burden, to the operator in his 
daily work schedule. This should be the highest priority of the new user interface. 
His job should become easier than what it was in the absence of the new operator 
interface. Otherwise, it will be looked upon as another burden he needs to fulfil 
before the end of every shift. The user interface should reduce his workload, reduce 
complexities, and improve his efficiencies. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT: AN OVERVIEW
8
• 
 The user interface should be designed for the operator. In the IT industry, while 
developing a user interface, we often miss the exact personas (the person who will 
be the actual user) and deliver something that is for a mix of personas. Drawing 
clear boundaries between what is an operator’s interface and what is a supervisor’s 
or manager’s interface will greatly improve the acceptance of the user interface. Too 
much or too little information on the screen or too many clicks to navigate will be 
viewed as negative factors. 
• 
 A smart design of the operator interface will give him a seamless experience, much 
like his smart devices at home. In today’s world, the probability is very high that the 
operator uses a smart device at home. Nowadays, like most of us, a significant part of 
an operator’s daily life is centered around personal smart devices. This is changing 
our expectation and interaction pattern with any user interface today. Hence, a user 
interface should have an interaction pattern that is simple and intuitive, and should 
provide an experience as smooth and obvious as the operator is used to with his 
smart devices. This will increase the acceptance of the system to a great extent. 
 Shop-Floor to Top-Floor Integration 
 This section will explain the need for  shop-floor to top-floor integration for manufacturing performance 
management. It will also provide an introduction to SAP MII and how MII as a framework ensures the 
shop-floor to top-floor integration. 
 To calculate and measure the OEE KPI, data must be collected about the various losses, such as 
machine downtimes, material wastage and scrap, production speed loss, and so on; this must be done 
continuously during the production runs. The data required for OEE calculations are available from different 
sources and measuring points, which can be either automatically available in some systems, or collected 
manually. The systems from which the manufacturing operational data can be collected are Plant Historian, 
SCADA or DCS, MES, or legacy database; these systems capture the process parameter data from various 
equipments and data-collection points in the production lines. Most of operational systems mentioned 
store the process data as time-series data — i.e., data-point value with the corresponding timestamp — and 
may provide OPC (OLE for Process Control) or other proprietary connectors through which the process 
parameter data need to be queried and aggregated in order to calculate the KPIs. The operational systems at 
the shop floor provide the real-time process data, but the planning data against which the actuals need to be 
compared reside in the enterprise planning and logistics systems, such as ERP. 
 It is also required to provide the transactional user interfaces through which the shop-floor users can 
manually capture data such as machine downtime, yield, scrap, and so on, as well as assign reason codes 
when the data are collected automatically. 
 Once the data are collected and the KPIs are calculated, one needs a dashboard with reports and 
analytics through which the OEE and other KPIs can be monitored and analyzed. 
 It is a common problem for the manufacturers who have multiple real-time and planning systems to 
aggregate and analyze the data centrally in near real-time mode. Without a system that can do that, the 
manufacturing shop-floor users lack the visibility and understanding of the actual situation on the shop 
floor and don’t know how to optimize the process by minimizing the losses. 
 To address these challenges, a platform is required that can easily integrate with different types of 
operational systems on the manufacturing shop floor, as well as with the planning system at the enterprise 
level, and that can aggregate the data by user-defined logic to derive meaningful KPIs and then provide a 
visualization platform through which the KPIs and the information can be monitored and analyzed. 

CHAPTER 1 ■ MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT: AN OVERVIEW

 SAP Manufacturing Integration & Intelligence (SAP MII)   is such a platform and is provided by SAP 
as part of its SAP Manufacturing portfolio of products, which aim to address the previously mentioned 
challenges. It is a stand-alone, web-based solution that runs on SAP NetWeaver Java WebAS. As its name 
makes clear, SAP MII provides two basic functionalities:
• 
 Integration with different applications in enterprise and manufacturing plants 
• 
 Intelligence on process information via reports, analytics, KPIs, alerts, and so on 
 For the integration functionality, SAP MII provides different types of connectors and interfacing 
mechanisms to exchange messages bi-directionally from SAP ERP, MES, Plant Historian, SCADA, and other 
legacy applications using different technical protocols as required. It provides Message Services to receive 
messages from any external system — such as ERP and MES — and SAP JCo and JRA interfaces to execute RFC 
(Remote Functional Call) and BAPI (Business API) in the SAP ERP system. Using SAP Plant Connectivity 
(PCo), which is an add-on component with SAP MII, SAP MII provides near real-time connectivity to almost 
all types of shop-floor automation control systems via various protocols, such as OPC (OLE for Process 
Control), ODBC (Open Database Connectivity), and OLEDB (OLE Database Connectivity), as well as 
proprietary protocols for specific SCADA and Plant Historian systems, such as Citect, OSISoft PI, iHistorian, 
and so on. It also provides Web Service – , JDBC-, FTP-, and HTTP-based integration capabilities with 
external systems through its business-logic services. 
 The intelligence is provided via custom reports, analytics, and dashboards, which are developed using 
the visualization service and the business-logic engine, where custom business logic for data processing can 
be developed as required based on the data collected from different systems. 
 Additionally, SAP MII provides a framework to map process data points as tags, which are available 
in the Plant Historian and SCADA systems using the Plant Catalog Services (PIC), to persist data as required 
using manufacturing data objects (MDO), and to define KPIs and alerts using KPI and Alert frameworks. It 
provides Business Logic Services (BLS), using which any type of custom business logic can be developed 
by graphical modelling. SAP MII also provides a component as an adaptor framework called SAP Plant 
Connectivity (PCo), which is used to connect to SCADA, Plant Data Historian, and other real-time systems 
via OPC and various other protocols, both by ad-hoc query and real-time notifications of a change of values 
in the source system. 
 Being a custom development and composition platform, any type of integration, analytics or 
monitoring, and transactional application can be developed on SAP MII. It can be used to collect the data 
from the manufacturing operations systems in near real-time, as well as provide transaction user interfaces 
with which to collect the data manually and develop business logic to aggregate and process the data so as to 
derive certain KPIs.

 A SAP MII solution overview is shown in Figure  1-3 . 
 Thus, SAP MII provides a powerful platform on which to develop manufacturing KPI management 
solutions by collecting data from various sources, persisting and aggregating them by specific business logic, 
and providing analytics with which to monitor and analyze the KPIs and data in real-time. 
 Summary 
 In this chapter, you have learned why measuring and monitoring KPIs is critical to the success of any 
manufacturing company, and how SAP MII can be used as a platform to develop KPI management solutions 
for manufacturing operations. 
 In the next chapter, you will learn about the SAP OEE solution on MII and how it can help in 
manufacturing performance management.

 CHAPTER 2  
 SAP OEE: A New Product for 
Manufacturing Performance 
Management 
 This chapter will explain how  SAP OEE is developed on the MII platform and how MII is used as an 
integration component (OEEINT) between ECC and OEE. It will also describes various features and 
components of SAP OEE. 
 As we learned in the previous chapter, Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is an important KPI 
that is critical for any manufacturing business to measure so as to understand the losses and points 
of optimization. With this information, they can make their products more cost effective and increase 
profitability. Three types of KPIs need to be measured in order to measure OEE:
• 
 performance or speed of the process 
• 
 availability of the machines 
• 
 quality of the product 
 To measure these elements, the data for operational parameters such as yield quantity, scrap quantity, 
cycle time, machine downtimes, and so on need to be collected in real-time. Once collected, it needs to be 
stored and aggregated, at which point the OEE KPI can be calculated and analyzed. 
 SAP OEE on MII platform 
 SAP OEE is a solution developed by SAP to address these requirements and is to be used on the 
manufacturing shop floor to view and collect data during manufacturing execution, and ultimately it will 
analyze the OEE and different production KPIs related to OEE. The solution is based on three different 
platforms or products — SAP ERP, SAP MII, and SAP HANA.    
• 
 SAP ERP is used to define the master and planning data, such as the material master, 
work center master, plant hierarchy, reason codes for deviations, data-collection 
elements, and production or process orders. 
• 
 SAP MII is used to provide the plant-operator dashboards through which the 
production operators can view and record operational details. 
• 
 Finally, SAP HANA, which is SAP’s in-memory database and platform for high-
volume data analysis, is used to calculate and analyze the OEE and related KPIs.

12
 Figure  2-1 explains the overall model for the SAP OEE solution. 
 Figure 2-1.  Overview of  SAP OEE 
 SAP MII is typically deployed at each manufacturing plant site, and it gets the relevant data from SAP 
ERP and provides the operator dashboards. In this way, SAP MII provides the front-end application for the 
SAP OEE solution. Since MII is the platform with which to integrate shop-floor systems, it can also integrate 
with the manufacturing automation systems, if available, to get the real-time information about production 
execution; otherwise, it gets the information from manual data recording in the production operator 
dashboards, which are also called PODs or Worker UIs. Typically the Worker UIs are used to record the start 
and stop of order operations or phases, yield, scrap, rework and waste quantities, and machine downtimes 
with reason codes. All this information is captured and persisted in the MII database, and is then transferred 
to SAP HANA. In the SAP HANA component of OEE, the availability, performance, and quality KPIs, along 
with the OEE KPI, are calculated for all plants. SAP HANA provides a set of pre-defined analytics content for 
OEE and offers the flexibility to do the analysis from different dimensions as per user need. 
 Solution Architecture of SAP OEE 
 This section will explain the application architecture of  SAP OEE.  
 As explained in the previous section, the SAP OEE solution is based on three major components: 
SAP ERP, SAP MII, and SAP HANA. The minimum version of SAP ERP required by SAP OEE is SAP ERP 6.0 
(EhP0 and above). For the SAP OEE features, the ERP add-on component required to be installed is called 
SAP Overall Equipment Effectiveness Add-On for SAP ERP (OEE_ERP). This provides the data model and the 
master and transactional data replication framework with OEE on MII. 
 Similarly, a component needs to be installed on SAP MII called OEE_MII. The OEE_MII component 
15.0 (in SAP MII 15.0) works on SAP NetWeaver Java 7.31 and NW 7.40. But the OEE_MII component 15.1 
(in SAP MII 15.1) works on SAP NetWeaver Java 7.50. 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ SAP OEE: A NEW PRODUCT FOR MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
13
 For SAP HANA, HCO_HBA_OEE 1.0 (SP06 or above) and HCO_HBA_APPS_OEE 1.0 (SP06 or above) 
components need to be installed that have SAP HANA 1.0 SP08 revision 82 or higher and SAP HANA 
Analytics Foundation 1.0 SP02 as the minimum support stack. 
 Additionally, SAP MII may use SAP Plant Connectivity (PCo), which is an add-on component with SAP 
MII. It must be installed as a Windows service, which provides the connectivity to shop-floor automation 
systems with SAP MII if it is used to fetch the data for OEE. 
 It is also possible to install and use SAP OEE without having SAP HANA or the HANA components. In 
that case, the standard analytics for SAP OEE, which is delivered by SAP for global corporate-level analytics, 
will not be available. But local plant-based reporting needs can be met by using SAP Lumira with a local SAP 
MII. Additionally, custom analytics can be developed on SAP MII itself by querying the data from the OEE 
database, which is hosted along with the NetWeaver database in the SAP MII server. 
 The data are synchronized between SAP ERP and MII through IDoc and RFC interfaces, which are 
used for sending the messages to MII and updating in SAP ERP, respectively. A framework for the message 
replication with SAP ERP is available as part of the OEE add-on on MII called the OEEINT (OEE Integration) 
framework. It provides a framework to manage the workflows of messages inbound and outbound to and 
from MII for OEE. SAP delivers a set of workflows required for OEE data exchange with SAP ERP, along with 
the corresponding mappings. 
 Once the data is received in OEE from SAP ERP by IDoc messages, it is stored in the OEE database, 
which is hosted in the same database of the SAP NetWeaver WebAS. 
 In OEE, the plant hierarchy (and relevant master and configuration data), reason code, and UoM are 
replicated, and the production-line view is made available. Once the production or process orders are 
received from SAP ERP, those are displayed in the operator dashboards for execution. 
 The operator dashboard is provided as a framework, with a set of dashboards delivered by SAP that can 
be enhanced by simple configurations and developments. The operators can view the order operations and 
record the production and loss data with reason codes, as well as view the order confirmations, through the 
operator dashboard in MII. 
 If shop-floor automation systems are available, and are using SAP  Plant Connectivity (PCo)  , the 
interfaces for the same can be developed to get the machine downtimes, order start and stop events, as well 
as view yield and scrap quantities. 
 Enhancement of the interfaces and logic can be developed using Business Logic Services in MII by 
creating custom transactions. The user can view the shift reports and the KPIs, which are dynamically 
calculated in real-time, through the operator dashboard in MII itself. 
 If SAP HANA is used for analytics, the master and configuration data from SAP ERP and the 
transactional data from SAP MII (OEE) are replicated in HANA through the  System Landscape 
Transformation (SLT) server provided with HANA. It directly replicates the data from the tables in the 
underlying databases of SAP ERP and OEE. You can analyze the downtime losses, performance losses, 
quality losses, and the KPI reports in SAP HANA, as they are delivered by SAP as pre-configured reports. 
The SAP HANA analytics of OEE consolidates the data from multiple plants (multiple MII systems) and 
provides the capability to view the reports for any of the plants/production lines/machines from a single 
HANA server. Additionally, SAP HANA reports provides options to drill down through the loss reasons up to 
ten levels to find the exact root cause. As the SAP HANA server has data from multiple plants, it also provides 
options to compare manufacturing performance between different plants/production lines/machines. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ SAP OEE: A NEW PRODUCT FOR MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
14
 Figure  2-2  shows the architecture of SAP OEE solution.  
 The SAP MII component, along with SAP Pco, is typically deployed at each manufacturing plant site, 
with SAP ERP and SAP HANA centrally deployed at the corporate data center, as shown in Figure  2-3 . 
 This is useful when integration with shop-floor automation control systems at manufacturing plant sites 
is required, as well as when supporting a large number of users at each plant site. It also helps to provide site 
survivability in case the network connection between the plant and the corporate network is not available at 
certain points in time. 
 Having all the data in the OEE component pre-synched from SAP ERP allows the users on the shop 
floor to carry on with their regular activities of order execution and corresponding data collection. Data 
updates to SAP ERP are buffered and retried through the OEEINT framework, so that updates occur when 
the network connectivity is available again. It is also easier to provide site-specific customizations in OEE for 
the operator dashboard, custom analytics, and shop-floor automation integration by deploying SAP MII at 
each site. 
 Also, plants with state of the art automation systems can use automated data collection from shop 
floor to OEE by using SAP PCo to a great extent. If required, though, SAP MII can also be deployed centrally 
for multiple plants when the integration needs for each plant and the number of users at each plant are 
minimal.

 SAP OEE: Product Overview 
 As you now understand the major components and systems of the SAP OEE solution, let us now explore the 
individual components and features of the solution. 
 SAP OEE Functional Model 
 SAP OEE provides a solution for capturing all kinds of data from the shop floor required for performance 
management. This includes the collection of data required for OEE calculations and analysis for a 
production process. The master data — such as material master, classification, material group, work center, 
plant hierarchy, shift, and reason code — are set up in SAP ERP as it is the leading system for handling master 
data for the enterprise. Production or process orders are also generated as transactional data in SAP ERP, as 
it is the planning system for manufacturing. Similarly, all the configuration data — such as KPI, production 
activities, data-collection element, data element, and so on — are also configured in SAP ERP, as it is the 
repository the OEE — related configuration data. These data are then sent to MII for order execution and data 
collection, which is done via the OEE dashboards by the production operators; confirmation of these tasks 
is sent back to SAP ERP. Finally, the analysis for the production KPIs is done in SAP HANA by replicating the 
data from SAP ERP and MII. Figure  2-4 shows the functional blocks of SAP OEE at a broad level. 
 Figure 2-3.  SAP OEE deployment architecture 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ SAP OEE: A NEW PRODUCT FOR MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
16
 The MII platform provides the core component of the OEE solution by supplying the operator 
dashboards and a data-collection repository for the OEE and related KPI calculations. As shown in 
Figure  2-5 later in this section, SAP OEE supports the typical flow of production or process-order execution. 
Once the order and the relevant data are sent to MII, the operator can do the following activities through the 
OEE Worker UI:
• 
 Select shift (automatic selection based on current time and shift configurations 
maintained in ERP) 
• 
 Select work unit or production line (automatic selection based on assignment of user 
group to production line in plant hierarchy) 
• 
 View production or process orders for the selected line and shift 
• 
 Select and start order 
• 
 Select/report/edit/delete the following data-collection elements:
• 
 Report machine stoppage and uptime (machine downtime with reason code)  
• 
 Report utility data (machine, setup, labor, energy) 
• 
 Report speed loss 
• 
 Report yield, scrap, quality, and defects 
• 
 Report any other custom data collection element 
• 
 Report material consumption (goods issue) and declare production 
(goods receipt) 
 All the preceding activities are performed through the OEE Worker UI, and the data are stored in the 
MII database for OEE as well as updated in SAP ERP as an order confirmation (with yield, activity, and goods 
receipt) wherever applicable. Certain data such as machine downtimes, speed loss, and utility data are not 
updated in SAP ERP and are stored in MII only. The data are replicated to HANA through the SLT server if 
configured. 
 The dashboards are configurable and can be enhanced to add new functionality. A framework called 
the worker user interface is provided for the same purpose in MII to configure the dashboards as required. 
The dashboard provides the data-collection framework for production as well as real-time visibility of the 
production process and machine availability. It shows the downtimes of the machines, order status, and the 
real-time OEE of the shift while executing an order. 
 Let us take an example of a food-manufacturing process. The production process may consist of one 
or more production lines with weighing and kitting machines, oven or mixer machines, and filling and 
packaging machines. There may be multiple oven or mixing machines for preparing the semi-finished 
product, which is transferred to the single filling and packing machines for final packing and declaring of 
 Figure 2-4.  SAP OEE broad-level functional blocks 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ SAP OEE: A NEW PRODUCT FOR MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
17
the goods receipt to the warehouse. For the filling and packing line, typically the filler or the palletizer can be 
considered as the bottleneck, as any stoppage of those machines may affect the production process. 
A functional overview of the SAP OEE solution is shown in Figure  2-5 . 
 The production supervisor may want to record the production data and order confirmations of the 
production lines as well as understand the losses that may be occurring due to machine stoppages, material 
losses, or human errors during production. The SAP OEE solution is used in production lines by the 
operators so as to understand which order is to be executed at which time and with which material. They 
will start and execute order operations through the OEE Worker UI and record any machine stoppages, 
using reason codes to specify the downtime. In this way the order confirmation will get updated in SAP ERP 
almost in real-time. The OEE and other relevant KPIs for the current shift are calculated and displayed on 
the dashboard in MII. The planners and supervisors can analyze the production KPIs and compare them for 
each production line and plant from the OEE application, which helps them to understand the frequency 
and root cause of any downtimes and losses that are affecting profitability so that they can take some action. 
 Thus SAP OEE provides an end-to-end solution for manufacturing execution and data collection along 
with a framework to calculate KPIs and analyze them so as to monitor and minimize losses.   
 SAP OEE Add-on Component in ECC 
 This section will explain how the OEE add-on component is utilized to create and maintain the OEE-related 
master and configuration data. 
 The SAP ERP system acts as the leading system for master and planning data maintenance in the SAP 
OEE solution. It is used to manage all the master data in the production-planning module that are relevant 
for OEE as well as some master and configuration data required specifically for OEE. 
 Figure 2-5.  SAP OEE functional overview 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ SAP OEE: A NEW PRODUCT FOR MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
18
 The following PP or  PP/PI master data are required in SAP ERP for OEE:
• 
 Plant 
• 
 Work center 
• 
 Shift definitions 
• 
 Material 
 The following PP or  PP/PI transactional data are required in SAP ERP for OEE:
• 
 Production or Process Order 
 These are the basic master data objects that provide information about the products, machine, 
and process of manufacturing. Along with this master data, related configuration data such as material 
classification and groups and work center shifts also need to be maintained for OEE. 
 There are some OEE-specific configuration and master data provided in SAP ERP as part of OEE add-on 
component, as follows:
• 
 Global Hierarchy 
• 
 Plant Hierarchy 
• 
 Reason codes 
 These master data are used to define the production-line structure in the plant where the OEE solution 
will be used. There are certain  configuration data also available in SAP ERP as part of OEE add-on, as 
follows:
• 
 Hierarchy Template: Hierarchy template to create global and plant hierarchy 
• 
 Hierarchy Node Classification: Classification of the nodes of the hierarchy 
• 
 Machine Groups: Groups to logically aggregate similar machines in the plant 
hierarchy.  Machine is a new type of object available as part of OEE. 
• 
 Production Activity: Activity types performed in the work center during production 
that are mapped to Work center standard values  
• 
 Data Element Types: Groups of data elements that categorize the individual data 
elements; SAP delivers a standard set of data element types.  
• 
 Data Elements: These elements form the basis of KPI calculation by categorizing the data 
being collected (e.g scheduled downtime has data elements listed as “SCHD_DWN”)  
• 
 Data Collection Context: This gives context to the data collection element. 
• 
 Data Collection Elements: This is a combination of data elements and data 
collection context that defines the fields in which data should get collected on the 
data collection screen of the OEE Worker UI. 
• 
 KPIs: KPI definition for OEE. Custom KPIs can be defined as well, along with 
four standard KPIs that are available by default. The targets of these KPIs can be 
maintained in the plant hierarchy definition. 
• 
 Reason Codes: These are loss reason codes used to tag machine downtime, scrap, 
waste, and rework during production reporting.    

CHAPTER 2 ■ SAP OEE: A NEW PRODUCT FOR MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
19
 Along with the master and configuration data, the planning data also need to be set up in SAP ERP. SAP 
OEE supports both production and process orders for discrete manufacturing and process manufacturing, 
respectively. By having the master and configuration data along with the planning data, such as production 
orders, defined and maintained in ERP, OEE solution simplifies the data-maintenance process and helps to 
avoid data duplicity. 
 Once all the preceding data are set up in SAP ERP, they need to be transferred to MII for execution and 
reporting in the OEE Worker UI, which will be explained in the next section. 
 SAP OEEINT for Integration of ECC and OEE 
 SAP MII needs to integrate with SAP ERP to receive the master, configuration, and transactional data as well 
as to update the order confirmations while executing a production or process order. SAP OEE provides a 
framework called OEEINT on SAP MII to integrate with SAP ERP. With this framework you can define and 
manage message workflows so as to process and transfer the messages between ERP and MII. Typically, SAP 
ERP sends IDoc messages for the master, configuration, and transactional data, which are received in MII 
and saved in the OEE database. SAP MII sends the order confirmation messages, which are used to execute 
BAPI interfaces in ERP to update the same against the corresponding order.     
 OEEINT provides a configurable workflow framework where you can specify the business logic 
with which to do validation and enrichment of the messages, as well as XSLT (XML Style Language 
Transformation) to transform the messages from ERP to OEE structure and vice versa. SAP provides a set of 
workflow configurations for the messages that are required in order for OEE to transfer from ERP to MII and 
vice versa with the required validation and enrichment logic, interface mapping, dispatching, and error-
handing logic. As it is an extensible framework, you can also enhance the standard message workflows for 
OEE that are provided by SAP by adding additional validation logic or mapping. Because OEEINT is based 
on the SAP MII platform, you can easily create the validation logic and mapping using a BLS transaction 
in MII, which is the graphical logic development engine. You can also create XSLT mappings for message 
transformation. An example is when you are adding additional details for material in a master or production 
order while sending it to MII. Instead of enhancing the interface in ERP, you can develop the additional logic 
in an MII BLS transaction and include in the corresponding message workflow to query the information and 
add it to the IDoc message after receiving it in MII. 
 Though SAP provides all the required message workflows for OEE, you can add additional workflows, 
if required, for any custom enhancements. For example, if you want to develop a plant maintenance order 
transfer scenario in OEE, which is not available by default, you can define a new message workflow to 
send PM work orders from SAP ERP for any equipment maintenance. You can also create different types of 
workflows, such as standard workflows to transform and dispatch the message from MII to either ERP or OEE 
database, split workflows to split a message based on message content, and correlation workflows to merge 
multiple messages based on message content. SAP-provided workflows use only standard workflow types. 
 OEEINT also provides a queue monitor with which you can monitor the messages processed by 
OEEINT workflows. You can monitor the type of message along with its identifier, such as plant, order 
number, and so on, as well as the current status of the message processing. You can also specify the retry 
limit of the message, where in the case of errors while executing the target interface, the workflow framework 
retries sending the message multiple times as defined by the retry limit specified. Also, the MII workbench 
is enhanced with additional OEE-specific custom action blocks that perform the automated data collection 
from the shop floor. The BLS transactions developed using these custom actions can be hooked to the OEE 
standard execution flow to fulfill the custom requirements. 
 SAP OEE Operator Dashboard (Worker UI) 
 This section will briefly explain one of OEE’s standard capabilities, the operator interface, via OEE dashboard 
(Worker UI). 

CHAPTER 2 ■ SAP OEE: A NEW PRODUCT FOR MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
20
 Once messages are received in MII from ERP, containing data such as the plant hierarchy, material 
master, work centers, shifts, production orders, and so on, the orders need to be executed so as to capture 
the transactional data for operation confirmation — yield, scrap, rework quantities, material consumption 
and utility, machine downtimes, and additional parametric data. The operation confirmation with this 
data is sent to SAP ERP as the order confirmation, while some information, such as machine downtimes 
and additional parametric data, is stored in the OEE database in MII only to then transfer to SAP HANA for 
further analysis. Also, OEE and other related KPIs defined in OEE configurations are calculated in real–time 
and displayed in OEE dashboards for the plant users. 
 SAP provides a set of standard dashboards for OEE, but the dashboards can be customized or new 
dashboards can be created using the OEE dashboard framework provided in MII. All the dashboards 
are developed using SAP UI5 as the user-interface technology and Java for the backend logic. You can 
define different activities for screen elements using SAP UI5 as well as logic components to be used in the 
dashboard using MII BLS transactions or in Java, and then use them in the dashboard configuration. 
 Because they are developed on SAP UI5, all OEE dashboards are mobile-browser compatible as well 
as desktop browser compatible, and can be accessed from various devices. This is useful for shop-floor 
users who will be accessing the application with specialized touch-screen devices while working on the 
production line. 
 You can assign dashboards for different production lines and for different user groups, so that a 
user, when logged in to MII, will get the dashboards assigned to his/her user group based on the selected 
production line. If multiple dashboards are assigned to the user group, then the user can select any of the 
dashboard at a time. You can also select a shift and view the orders available for execution during that shift, 
then begin executing the order, such as starting or stopping an operation, and recording the yield, scrap, 
data collection, machine downtime, and so on. You can have different types of dashboards customized 
for different user groups, such as an operator dashboard for data collection and operation execution, a 
production supervisor dashboard for shift review and line KPI monitoring, and so forth. Refer to Figure  2-6 
for a sample OEE dashboard. 
 Figure 2-6.  SAP OEE dashboard 
 

CHAPTER 2 ■ SAP OEE: A NEW PRODUCT FOR MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
21
 To enhance the dashboard functionality, you can also define an extension configuration for each 
production line to trigger certain functions on specific events, such as start order operation, stop order, 
complete order, report data, report uptime, close shift, and so on. You can develop an extension as logic 
within MII BLS transactions and create an activity for it, then link it with the events for the production line, 
which will be triggered when the event occurs; for example, checking if there is any machine downtime 
already there for the production line when the operator starts an order operation from the OEE dashboard. 
 Thus the dashboards in OEE provide a single-window system for all the execution activities and data 
recordings for the manufacturing plant users, as well as provide a real-time view of the OEE KPIs for the 
plant users. 
 SAP OEE Reporting and Analytics 
 This section will explain about the different options SAP OEE provides for reporting and analytics.    
 SAP OEE provides options to analyze the data collected from the shop floor both at local plant level and 
at the global corporation level. The plant-level analytics are enabled by consuming the data collected on 
the local MII server through SAP Lumira. As the data comes from a single MII box, these kinds of reports are 
limited to the production lines configured on that MII system. For such local plant-level analytics, SAP OEE 
delivers a plug-in that can be used in SAP Lumira to consume the MII data through CSV files. More about 
this will be covered in chapter   9 . 
 For consolidated global-level analytics, SAP OEE delivers standard HANA content. In this case, a 
centralized HANA server should be connected to all the plant-level MII boxes. Data is copied to this central 
box through System Landscape Transformation (SLT)  replication . The SAP OEE HANA content delivers a set 
of standard views that help in analyzing the data either through standard visualization tools like SAP Lumira 
or through the SAP OEE HANA web application. As SAP HANA is an in-memory database solution and 
application platform, it provides the capability to analyze a huge amount of data easily via different types of 
analysis. SAP HANA provides an in-memory database where the OEE data models are maintained and the 
data are replicated from ERP and MII. This is done using SLT, which is a standard replication mechanism 
available in the HANA platform, along with other SAP systems. The analytics logic and queries are also 
maintained in OEE HANA content, as different types of views and analytics reports on SAP UI5 are also 
provided on the  HANA platform . SAP provides the standard data model for OEE, along with the analytics 
queries and reports on HANA, as a HANA Live component, an add-on to the OEE solution. Though it is a 
technically optional component, by using the HANA add-on for OEE you can get the analytics and reports 
for OEE without any custom development. The SAP-provided reports on HANA for OEE are as follows:
• 
 Loss Analysis Report : Provides the reports for different types of losses, such as speed 
loss, quality loss, downtimes loss, and so forth, based on reason codes. A daily/
monthly/weekly trend analysis is also provided. The reason codes can be drilled 
down level by level for root-cause analysis. 
• 
  KPI Analysis Reports : By using these reports you can analyze the different OEE KPIs 
based on those defined in the OEE add-on in ERP with respect to the plant hierarchy. 
You can also view the trend analysis for the OEE KPIs over a period of time and see 
an asset utilization analysis. 
• 
  Data Collection Report : You can view the different reports for data collection in OEE 
based on the data elements or data collection elements and analyze the trends and 
measures. 
 For most of the analytics, you can drill down across the plant hierarchy to analyze the KPIs that are 
rolled-up; for example, you can analyze performance of the dependent assets or KPIs, which helps you to 
understand how the granular KPIs and losses are affecting the overall performance. 

CHAPTER 2 ■ SAP OEE: A NEW PRODUCT FOR MANUFACTURING PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT
22
 You can also customize and modify the standard reports provided on HANA according to specific 
requirements by modifying the views, queries, and web reports on SAP UI5. Without using HANA there are 
no standard reports for OEE delivered in MII or ERP, and you may need to develop custom reports on MII by 
developing the logic and user interface on the MII platform. 
 SAP  HANA is installed centrally as a global instance, whereas SAP MII instances for OEE may be plant 
specific, one for each plant or for a group of plants. By having reporting on the HANA platform, it is easier 
to collate the data from multiple plants from different MII instances that are deployed at each plant site 
and then analyze cross-plant KPIs; for example, comparing the OEE or asset utilization KPIs for similar 
production lines across different plants to compare the performance and losses between different plants. 
You can configure to move the data from MII to HANA at certain periodic intervals or upon any data change 
in the OEE database in MII, which may provide near-real-time analytics on the HANA platform.   
 SAP OEE: Benefits 
 This section will explain about benefits of  SAP OEE. 
 As you have learned the different components and features of OEE, you can now understand how 
the SAP OEE solution helps in the manufacturing-execution data collection for calculating the KPIs and 
losses that may occur during production. SAP ERP is the planning and logistics execution system, while MII 
provides the real-time platform for execution and data collection. The HANA platform is used for cross-
plant KPI analysis and reporting for OEE. SAP OEE complements the existing ERP implementation and 
provides an end-to-end solution connecting the planning, execution, and analysis for measuring losses and 
production KPIs, which helps to optimize the production process and minimize losses. 
 SAP OEE can be used for various manufacturing industries, mostly for process industries where you 
need a solution to capture the production information continuously and measure the OEE and production 
losses for multiple machines by either manual or automated data-collection methods. 
 Overall, SAP OEE provides the following benefits:
• 
 Provides a rapidly scalable means for manufacturing performance management 
on the shop floor. It would take several months to develop and implement such a 
performance-management solution on MII, which the customers get as a standard 
solution with SAP OEE. 
• 
 Enables the production operators to view the schedule and order details through a 
simplified user interface and to collect and record the data for the manufacturing 
process 
• 
 Simplifies bi-directional integration with SAP ERP and manufacturing shop-floor 
systems for real-time data collection and production confirmations 
• 
 Provides near-real-time analysis at local plant level and global corporation level for 
determining the hidden root causes for several production losses and optimizes the 
process on a continuous basis 
 Summary 
 In this chapter you have learned about the features and components of SAP OEE and its overall solution 
architecture. You have learned the functionality and features of SAP ERP, SAP MII, and SAP HANA as 
components of the OEE solution and how data collection and analysis for OEE and related KPIs are achieved 
by SAP OEE. 
 In the next chapter you will learn more about the OEE add-on for SAP ERP and how to configure the 
different master and configuration data required for OEE.

 CHAPTER 3  
 The SAP OEE Add-on Component 
of ERP 
 This chapter will explain how the SAP OEE add-on component installed in SAP ERP helps in the 
configuration and maintenance of OEE-specific master data and configuration data. It will also detail the 
required ALE settings to be configured for the transfer of OEE master and configuration data as IDocs. 
SAP OEE provides seamless integration of the master data and transactional data in SAP ERP with the 
plant-level SAP MII system for production and other related data collection and reporting. 
 The SAP OEE application uses production-related master data from SAP ERP along with the real-time 
data captured in MII to calculate OEE KPIs and provide data for analyzing plant performance. 
 It is essential to set up these master data as a single source of reliable data by leveraging the OEE 
master-data setup features of ERP, which are created and maintained in SAP ERP using the OEE add-on 
component OEE_ERP. 
 Once the master and configuration data are defined in ERP, the data required for shop-floor execution 
are transferred to the shop floor SAP MII systems through IDoc interfaces. The master data required for the 
analytics are transferred to SAP HANA system using SAP Landscape Transformation (SLT) from SAP ERP. 
 OEE Master Data in ERP 
 This section will explain OEE-related master data, its purpose, and the steps required to configure and 
maintain it, as well as how the master data facilitates the execution of OEE and KPI functionality using the 
OEE add-on component of ERP. 
 OEE uses the following  master data:  
• 
 Existing master data in ERP
• 
 Material master data 
• 
 Work center and associated capacities, shift definitions, and UOM 
• 
 Factory Calendar 
• 
 OEE- specific master data (available in OEE add-on)
• 
 Global hierarchy 
• 
 Plant hierarchy 
• 
 Plant reason codes 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
24
 You can configure this master data in SAP ERP from the SAP Easy Access menu:  Logistics ➤ Production 
➤ Overall Equipment Effectiveness ➤ Master Data. Refer to Figure  3-1 . 
 Figure 3-1.  SAP  Easy Access menu with OEE  
 Before we get into the details of OEE-specific data setup, let us have a look at shift configurations for 
a work center. OEE uses the work center – integrated shift definitions for collecting the production and loss 
information on the shop floor. 
 Shift Configurations 
 Usually the manufacturing execution process on the shop floor works in shifts. A shift is a type of work 
schedule in which group of workers rotate through set periods throughout the day, typically performing the 
same kind of work. Shift work is common in production environments where repetitive tasks are performed 
and production takes place around the clock. 
 SAP OEE requires the shift definitions, the collection of shift-specific production data and losses, and 
the calculation of shift-specific KPIs. This helps in analyzing the shift’s performance specific to equipment, 
line, plant, and so on. These shift details are used in the work center, or resource shift definitions in ERP are 
defined for production planning. 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
25
 Production planning in ERP is done based on the work center’s capacity level. Each work center is 
assigned a shift definition and is associated with the plant hierarchy used in OEE, which we will explore in a 
later section. Upon the transfer of these work centers, shift definitions, and plant hierarchy from ERP to MII, 
OEE gets the plant- and work center – specific shift details and the laborers’ working patterns. 
 Ideally, a work center or resource in ERP will have the shift configuration maintained. You can either 
maintain the existing set or create a new set of shift configurations. 
 Configure Shift Grouping 
 Shift grouping is the shift header under which you can define the shift definitions, shift sequence, and 
work break schedules.

■ Note  Shift breaks are entered with start and end times and a break code. When “Use shift breaks” is 
checked in the plant hierarchy node (master data of OEE), these shift breaks will be automatically considered 
when calculating the OEE KPI. Shift breaks are defined by a start time and an end time. 
 Configure/Maintain Shift Definitions 
 You configure the shift definitions to define the number of shifts and their duration as per your factory 
calendar and production requirements: 
 
 1. 
 Select the configured shift grouping from the preceding section and select the 
“Shift definitions” option in the left-hand hierarchy. 
 
 2. 
 Select the pen icon to add new or maintain existing shift definitions. 
 
 3. 
 Define a unique shift ID, description, start date time, end date time, and break. 
(Refer to Figure  3-3 .) 
 
 
These shift definitions will be downloaded to OEE and will be followed as the 
shift pattern in the plant once this shift is assigned to a work center.      
 Figure 3-3.  Configure shift definitions 
 Configure/Maintain Shift Sequence 
 The shift sequence organizes the shifts into a daily schedule and order. You need to follow the following 
steps to configure the shift sequence: 
 
 1. 
 Select shift grouping and then select shift sequence (refer to Figure  3-4 ).

 2. 
 Enter the sequence name, sequence number (the order of shift), and description. 
 
 3. 
 Define the preceding shift sequence from Day 1 to Day 7 based on your plant 
requirements and calendar. 
 
 4. 
 For each day, enter the shift defined in the previous step in the required 
sequence. 
 
 
OEE displays the shifts in the operator dashboard as per this sequence only. 
 
 5. 
 Save the entries. 
 Associate Shift with Work Center Capacity 
 You need to assign the shift definitions to a work center, as each work center may operate in a different shift 
pattern depending on production requirements. To assign the shift to a work center, you have to perform the 
following procedure. 
 
 1. 
 Use transaction code CR02 or go to SAP Easy Access menu: Logistics ➤ 
Production ➤ Master data ➤ Work centers ➤ Change 
 
 2. 
 Enter the plant name and work center name with which the shift needs to be 
associated. 
 
 3. 
 Select the Capacities tab and select the Capacity button on the bottom.  
 
 4. 
 Assign the capacity planner group, grouping, active version, factory calendar ID, 
and base UOM. (Refer to Figure  3-5 .)
 The capacity planner group is required in order for a capacity planner to know the 
capacity he has to work with during the planning process. Grouping defines 
the shift sequences and shift definitions that are used to maintain the available 
capacity. Factory calendar ID is the calendar of your country maintained in 
ERP, while active version is the version number of the available capacity. Active 
version is used in scheduling and capacity planning and is a mandatory setting. 
The base unit of measure is the unit of measure of the capacity, e.g., Days.

 OEE Configuration Data in ERP 
 This section will explain the purpose of and steps by which to configure OEE-related configuration data,  
such as data collection elements, data elements, KPI definitions, machine groups, production modes, 
production activities, hierarchy-node classifications, UOM and dimensions, standard value key and formula 
parameters, and factory calendar. 
 Figure 3-6.  Configure daily shift intervals 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP

 Figure 3-7.  OEE configuration data hierarchy 
 The SAP OEE application requires multiple types of data for KPI calculations and to report shop-floor 
data back to ERP. These data are either production-related data (yield) or loss data (scrap, downtime, speed 
loss, and so on) captured during the process of production. They are either of quantity or time dimension. 
SAP OEE enables the categorization of these production and loss data as a hierarchy structure for easy 
understanding, data configuration, and data maintenance. 
 In the OEE data element hierarchy (refer to Figure  3-7 ), data collection element is the key element 
which are defined as part of different data elements. The actual shop floor data are collected using these 
elements using OEE operator dashboards. 
 The other hierarchy structures help the categorization of data elements and data collection elements. 
 Data Collection Category 
 Data collection category is the data type of the data being collected by OEE; e.g., production data and loss data.  
 All the sub-elements after this in the hierarchy fall under either of these data types. These two data types 
are preconfigured in the OEE add-on during the component installation. 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
31
 Data Element Type 
 A data element type is used to categorize the OEE data elements. It is the hard-coded system element that 
defines the basic structure of how OEE is modelled and calculated in the solution.  
 By default, the OEE application delivers data element types for collecting and calculating OEE KPI.    
 The system default data element types for capturing OEE data are the following:   
• 
 SCHED_DOWN (scheduled downtime)
• 
 Scheduled downtime is a planned maintenance time for a resource. Downtime 
for the purpose of maintenance is scheduled as a part of the manufacturing 
day and, in some cases, as an integral part of the manufacturing process. It also 
includes performing routine actions that keep the device in working order. The 
goal is to keep emergency and unscheduled maintenance to a minimum. 
• 
 Scheduled downtimes can be defined at the plant level from the SAP MII main 
menu ➤ Worker UI Management ➤ Scheduled Downtime Maintenance or from 
the standard dashboard. Refer to chapter   6 . 
• 
 UNSCD_DOWN (unscheduled downtime)
• 
 All the unplanned downtime reported from the shop floor. 
• 
 SPEED_LOSS (speed loss)
• 
 Reduction of production due to reduction of line speed. 
• 
 Actual production duration – rated production duration 
• 
 Speed loss is calculated based on reported production quantity and standard 
rate/nominal speed. Speed loss is reported and managed through the OEE 
dashboard. 
• 
 YIELD 
• 
 Produced good quantity 
• 
 REWORK 
• 
 Quality defects during production 
• 
 SCRAP 
• 
 Waste produced during production 
• 
 Yield, rework, and scrap can be reported manually through the dashboard or 
automatically from the shop floor using PCo (plant connectivity)  
• 
 NOT_APPL 
• 
 Data element type for a non-OEE data element 
 SAP OEE identifies the preceding list of elements as reported elements; i.e., these data are collected 
by the operator in the UI either manually or automatically. This list can be enhanced with the creation of 
custom data element types as per the business requirements, which may or may not be OEE related. 
The custom data elements should fall under any of the preceding OEE-defined data element types. For 
non-OEE-related data elements, the data element type should be  NOT_APPL .

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
32
 The system default data element types for calculating OEE and its associated KPIs are the following: 
• 
 TOT_PRD_TM (total production time)
• 
 Total available time considering 24 hours in a day and all seven days as working     
• 
 LOADING_TM (loading time)
• 
 Calculated as order completion time – order start time  
• 
 Excludes scheduled downtimes, order hold time, and shift breaks (is set to  true 
in plant hierarchy for the line). 
• 
 In OEE, loading time for a shift is an aggregation of the loading time of each 
order executed in that shift. 
• 
 NET_PRD_TM (net production time)
• 
 Calculated as loading time – unscheduled downtime 
• 
 Availability KPI =  NET_PRD_TM /  LOADING_TM 
• 
 NET_OPR_TM (net operating time)
• 
 Calculated as  NET_PRD_TM - speed loss 
• 
 Performance KPI = NET_OPR_TM / NET_PRD_TM 
• 
 VAL_OPR_TM (value operating time)
• 
 Calculated as  NET_OPR_TM  - quality loss 
• 
 Quality KPI =  VAL_OPR_TM /  NET_OPR_TM 
 SAP OEE identifies the preceding list of elements as calculated elements; i.e., these data are calculated 
by SAP OEE using the elements reported by the operator in the UI. This list is hard coded in the OEE add-on. 
 When the OEE application is implemented for multiple plants, each plant may have different data 
collection needs. All those data collection elements can be created under data element types and can be 
used across sites. 
 This process of creating and maintaining the configuration data at one place in ERP ensures a single 
source of standards and no data duplication.

 Follow the preceding steps to configure all the standard data element types. 
 
■ Note  At least one data collection element should exist for each data element type. 
 Data Element 
 Data elements are data components that store the OEE-specific shop-floor data reported through the 
operator dashboard and calculate the standard KPIs using the stored data.    
 OEE operator dashboards are predelivered user interfaces used to collect the shop-floor production 
information during production execution. 
 For example, good-quantity production and production losses, such as scrap, rework, speed loss, and 
downtimes, are collected and used in calculating the standard KPIs. 
 To capture the different data inputs required for KPI calculations, data collection elements are 
configured in the operator UI. In summary, data collection elements are data components that collect data 
from the operator through the UI, and data elements are the level of abstraction for the data collection 
elements. 
 Data collection elements can be used to capture OEE- and non-OEE-specific data. This ensures OEE is 
an application to leverage beyond KPI. 
 For example, data elements can be used for non-OEE data like material consumption, line set speed, 
and standard value parameters like machine time, labor time, and so on. SAP OEE does not restrict you to 
collect data which are just required for the calculation of four standard KPIs but it allows you to collect 
non-OEE KPI related data as well which could be part of other plant requirements. It is scalable and flexible. 
 
■ Note  It is not mandatory to configure a data element for a non-OEE data collection element.

wherever this data element is utilized. 
 
 6. 
 Save the entries. 
 Follow the preceding steps to configure all the data elements.  
 Data Collection Contexts 
 Data collection contexts help you to define the contexts of the data collection elements. Data collection 
elements are logically categorized based on the contexts for which they are being collected. This is similar to 
data collection category, which defines the data type of element being reported and calculated.    
 Data collection contexts are specific to the standard activities type ( RecTypeGrp ) defined for work 
centers or resources in PP and PP/PI. For example, if a data collection element is used to collect data for ERP 
transactions, the context is used to associate the data with the reporting types and activities defined in PP and 
PP/PI. Default contexts in OEE are finished materials, raw materials, utilities, setup, teardown, and so on. This 
facilitates the hassle-free integration of OEE with ERP for production confirmation and material consumption. 
 For example, the predefined data collection contexts specific to finished material and raw material are 
as follows:
• 
 FIN_MAT context is related to yield, scrap, and rework data collection types to 
facilitate the yield confirmation, scrap confirmation, and rework transactions in PP. 
• 
 RAW_MAT context can be related to the yield and scrap data collection types to 
facilitate the material consumption and scrap consumption update transaction in PP.

 Hierarchy Node Classification 
 Hierarchy Node classification allows you to define a category or a classification with which multiple nodes in 
a global or plant hierarchy can be associated (Refer to Hierarchy Model in OEE section later in this chapter). 
This helps in HANA analytics for comparing performance across comparable assets in the plant hierarchy or 
across plants based on the defined  node classification. 
 You can assign a classification to a plant, work center, or machine node type. Grouping node types 
cannot be classified. 
 For example, a node classification can be created for a technology. In a plant, some lines or product 
ranges might be produced with a specific state of the art technology. Those work center nodes can be 
assigned to a technology classification, which helps HANA to analyze the performance of the line based on 
that technology. 
 A node classification can be created to specify a product line. All of the lines, work centers, or machines 
in the hierarchy can be assigned to a category to specify that they are utilized for that product line. When 
analyzing OEE performance, a report could be generated to compare the performance of the process for the 
particular product line.

     Machine Groups 
 Machine groups are a way to group similar machines. This is used as an additional dimension in the 
analytics for comparing performance across comparable machines in the plant hierarchy or across plants.  
 For example, a machine group can be created to specify the vendor of the machine. All of the machines 
in the hierarchy can be assigned to this machine group to make it clear that the same vendor manufactures 
them all. When analyzing OEE performance, a report can be generated to compare the performance of the 
machines of the particular vendor. 
 Figure 3-15.  Configuration of hierarchy node classification 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
40
 Machines under different work centers, which perform similar functions, can be grouped under a 
machine group, which enables HANA to compare the performance of the machines across different work 
centers. This will enable one to identify the poor-performing machines for a particular line.

 Production Modes 
 Production modes in OEE are used to define a production process and associate it with the different order 
types maintained in PP and PP/PI.  
 
■ Note  An OEE production mode can be associated with multiple order types, but an order type can only be 
associated with one OEE production mode. 
 Figure 3-16.  Configuration of hierarchy node classification 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
41
 These production modes are downloaded to OEE in MII from ERP and used during order execution. 
OEE handles both production and process order scenarios and hence the production modes specific to each 
piece of data are stored in HANA. The production modes can also be used as one of the filter criteria during 
HANA analytics.

 Production Activities 
 Typically on a shop floor different types of production activities are carried out, namely processing, setup, 
changeover, consuming, and so on. This normally depends on the industry type. Hence, it is essential and 
good to have a solution that will allow for configuring different production activities during order execution. 
The operator should be able to visualize the current production activity, which will ensure all the different 
activities are captured with respect to duration. This will help in analyzing the line performance and 
efficiency within the shift. 
 Figure 3-17.  Configuration of production modes 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
42
 Production activity in OEE allows the configuration of production into multiple process groups like 
line setup, consuming, producing, changeover, cleaning, and so forth as per your plant requirements. 
Configuring production activities in ERP and downloading to OEE enables the shop-floor operator to 
capture the actual duration of different production activities. Hence, manual errors are avoided as the 
system captures the actual shop-floor information with minimal manual inputs. 
 For example, for an order with configured production activities, the user is visually shown the sequential 
production phases and prompted to follow the sequential process. The operator has the flexibility to start the 
right production activity/phase as per the line’s requirements, and this information is saved in the OEE database. 
 Production activity is totally independent of OEE calculations. It is again a filter or dimension used in 
HANA to analyze OEE KPIs. 
 Production activities can also be leveraged to record the standard values defined for a work center in PP 
and PP/PI, though this is not mandatory. The standard activities defined for the work center are captured via 
the operator dashboard and are updated back to ERP. 
 Configure Production Activities

 3. 
 Enter the production activity name and description. 
 
 4. 
 Assign a  RecTypeGrp to associate the OEE activity with the activities defined in 
PP and PP/PI for the work center under costing. 
 RecTypeGrp , or Record type group, refers to how different production activities are 
collected during the order execution. For example, production activities can be setup 
time, machine time, labor time, or any other custom activities. These activities are 
grouped under specific record type groups like setup, teardown, variable activity, 
and so on depending on the purpose of each activity. 
 
 5. 
 Save the production activity. 
 KPI Configuration 
 In chapter   1 , we discussed the purpose and benefits of KPI, typically for a manufacturing industry.  
 In this section, we will look at how the OEE solution enables you to configure and use the KPIs. 
 SAP OEE allows you to configure any type of KPI. By default, it comes with the predefined design for the 
calculation of four KPIs, namely availability, performance, quality, and OEE. 
 Figure 3-18.  Configuration of production activities 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
43
 The defined KPIs are associated with plant hierarchy nodes as per your plant requirements; A Plant 
hierarchy node which is marked for “Report Production” signifies that KPIs are calculated at this level. 
Hence, as per the plant requirement, the “Report Production” check box should be enabled. This node is 
ideally the work center node. Different KPIs can be configured for different plant hierarchy nodes. 
 Each KPI is to be defined with a target, which can vary for each node. These KPIs, which are integrated 
with plant hierarchy, are downloaded to OEE for real-time calculation and monitoring based on their target 
values. The KPIs are updated in real-time in the color combination based on the target range defined. 
Refer to Plant hierarchy configuration section Figure  3-44 in the current chapter to understand on the color 
combinations. 
 SAP OEE allows the definition of custom KPIs apart from the preceding four standard KPIs. A custom 
logic needs to be developed to calculate the custom KPI, and custom configurations must be done to display 
the custom KPI in the operator dashboard.

 Hierarchy Model in OEE 
 A hierarchy is a relational model composed of systems and sub-systems; it represents multiple levels 
of detail in describing the organization, plant, or production line. The model reflects how systems and 
sub-systems fit together, interrelate, and operate to provide the intended business function. As such, the 
hierarchy reflects both the structural and process flow characteristics of the plant or production line.    
 SAP OEE follows the hierarchy model in defining the structural model of a typical organization, right 
from an enterprise unit to machines on a shop floor of a plant.  
 The SAP OEE solution is capable of working with a multi-plant landscape to execute shop-floor orders, 
capture production and loss information, and calculate the KPIs and analytics reporting. 
 In this process, SAP OEE is expected to fulfill certain requirements and address the challenges from an 
execution-platform perspective. Table  3-1 lists the plant requirements and how SAP OEE addresses each 
requirement using the hierarchy model. 
 Table 3-1.  Requirements Versus Solution for OEE Hierarchy Model 
 Requirement 
 Solution 
 Need to collate data from multiple 
plants for performance analysis 
 OEE hierarchy model enables data collection at machine and 
line nodes of hierarchy and aggregation at other nodes, ensuring 
better data modeling and analytics. 
 Corporate and plant-specific data 
should be configurable and flexible 
 OEE hierarchy model is completely configurable and flexible 
in defining the parent – child relationship needs of a business 
requirement. 
 Avoid data duplication and reuse 
capability 
 OEE hierarchy model is defined and maintained in ERP as 
master data ensuring a single source of correct information and 
avoiding data duplication. In addition, it takes advantage of 
reusing the existing master data setup of ERP, like material, work 
center, functional locations, equipment, etc. 
 Easy to use and configure 
 OEE hierarchy model accommodates the entire configuration 
data created for OEE purpose. 
 Flexible in terms of KPI calculations; 
 i.e., system should be able to calculate 
KPI at plant/line/machine level as per 
the business requirements 
 Provides the flexibility to define the OEE requirements of various 
nodes of the hierarchy as needed through a simple configuration 
and transfer mechanism. For example, data are collected at 
machine and line levels and KPIs are calculated and monitored 
at line level. 
 Should follow a centralized approach in 
utilizing the data across multiple plants 
 OEE hierarchy configurations are centralized so the 
comprehensive list of elements can be defined, configured, and 
used in all plants, ensuring data consistency. However, plant-
specific configurations are also facilitated. 
 Easy multi-plant performance reporting 
and analysis 
 Using HANA, OEE ensures easy analysis of performance 
reporting, as well as performance comparisons with a node 
classification for each node of the hierarchy model.

 Global Hierarchy 
 Global hierarchy in OEE represents an organization or enterprise’s hierarchy. There are four node 
types — corporate, region, country, and plant — which can be used in a global hierarchy, with plant as the 
lowest-level node. 
 The global hierarchy is used above the plant hierarchy for reporting and analyzing OEE across the plants. 
 To configure both global and plant hierarchies, the hierarchy templates need to be defined. 
 Global Hierarchy Template Configurations 
 Hierarchy templates are required for configuring global and plant hierarchies. Typically, for an enterprise 
under a global hierarchy, different plant hierarchy templates (if the plant model is different) should be 
defined and used as the foundation when creating the plant hierarchy for each plant. These templates 
ensure hassle-free configuration of multiple and varied plant hierarchies. This section will detail how to 
configure the  global hierarchy template. 
 
 1. 
 Use transaction code SPRO and open SAP Reference IMG ➤ Production ➤ 
Overall Equipment Effectiveness ➤ Define Hierarchy Template 
 Select New Entries and enter the new hierarchy template name — e.g., “GLOBALOEE.” 
In the main window, check the “Global” checkbox. This is an indicator for a global 
hierarchy, as shown in Figure  3-20 . 
 Figure 3-20.  Configure global hierarchy template 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
46
 
 2. 
 Select the created template and then select Node Type on the left-hand pane 
as shown in Figure  3-21 . Node-type configuration defines the different nodes 
required for a global hierarchy. The four nodes are enterprise, region, country, 
and plant, with the lowest node being plant. The other three nodes are flexible 
and can be defined as per the enterprise requirements. For example, the 
hierarchy nodes can be defined as region, country, site, and plant.   
 
 3. 
 To define the node type, select New Entries and follow the steps in the following 
section for each node type (refer to Figure  3-21 ). 
 Defining Node Type 
 In this step, you will define the node type that will be used when creating the global hierarchy. For example, 
enterprise is a node type that forms the root node of the  global hierarchy. 
 
 1. 
 Display icon: Select the relevant icon from the list. This icon visually signifies the 
node type. 
 
 2. 
 Node type description: Meaningful description of the node type to be created; 
e.g., enterprise. 
 
 3. 
 Check “Grouping” checkbox. This signifies that the node type is not assigned 
to any work center, machine, or plant for planning or maintenance purposes. 
Hence, except for node type plant, all the other node types of a global hierarchy 
will have the “Grouping” checkbox checked (refer to Figure  3-22 ). 
 Figure 3-21.  Configure global hierarchy template: node type 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP

 4. 
 Follow steps 1 to 3 to create other child node types like region, country, and plant 
(refer to Figures  3-23 ,  3-24 , and  3-25 ). 
 Figure 3-23.    Configure global hierarchy template with country node type (Level 2)

 6. 
 “Relationship” for a global hierarchy is a configuration to define the hierarchical 
relationship between the different node types created. 
 
 7. 
 Enter the following parent – child relationships in a sequence as shown in 
Figure  3-27 . 
 
 8. 
 Sequence 0 at the top has the first node, enterprise, of the global hierarchy. Since 
there is no parent node for the first node, add it as a child type. 
 
 9. 
 Sequence 1, region, is a child node with enterprise as its parent node 
 
 10. 
 Follow the previous steps to create all the nodes until the last node, plant.  
 
 11. 
 Save the entries.

 Global Hierarchy Configuration 
 You have configured the global hierarchy template. Using this template, you can now configure the  global 
hierarchy. 
 Prerequisite: Create a global hierarchy template as described in the previous section.
 
 1. 
 On the SAP Easy Access menu, choose Logistics ➤ Production ➤ Overall 
Equipment Effectiveness ➤ Master Data ➤ Global Hierarchy 
 
 2. 
 Enter a global hierarchy name and select Create. Select the global hierarchy 
template to be used (refer to Figure  3-28 ). 
 
■ Note  Only one global hierarchy can be defined in an ERP system. 
 
 3. 
 Create / change / delete the nodes using the Node menu button on the top 
left menu bar. Select the first node,  REGION . The node menu strictly follows the 
structure defined under the global hierarchy template (refer to Figure  3-29 ). 
 
 4. 
 Enter the region name (e.g., APAC) and click Enter.  
 
 5. 
 Once the region is added, select the region and click the Node menu button to create 
the next node, country. Enter the country name and click Enter (refer to Figure  3-30 ). 
 Figure 3-28.  Configure global hierarchy

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
51
 
 6. 
 Follow the same steps until the last node, plant, is created.  
 
 7. 
 For each node type, additional information (refer to Figure  3-31 ) can be provided 
to fill in the Details and KPI Targets tabs. For all the nodes other than plant, the 
Details tab has the validity periods and the status. The status of the hierarchy is 
displayed in the Status field, which is set to New for a newly configured global 
hierarchy.

 Figure 3-30.  Configure global hierarchy nodes: Country 
 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
52
 
 8. 
 For a plant node, the Details tab associates the hierarchy with the ERP plant, 
client, and logical system.
 a. 
 Logical system: The logical system points to the Plant MII(OEE) system 
dedicated for plant(s). With the logical system definition, the OEE understands 
to which plant, it needs to send the master and production information.  
 b. 
 Plant and client: These are the ERP plant and client that are associated with 
the OEE master data. 
 
■ Note  A Plant node can be assigned to more than one global hierarchy for reporting and analytics purposes. 
 
 9. 
 KPI Targets: KPIs can be assigned to all node levels in the hierarchy. KPI 
targets are material independent. KPI value ranges specified can be positive, 
negative, or bi-directional based on the KPI type. These value ranges are used 
while generating analytic reports. KPI targets for standard KPIs like availability, 
performance, quality, and OEE are defined here. Please refer to the KPI 
configuration section for more details. 
 
■ Note   Global hierarchy is transferred to the HANA system. 
 To publish a hierarchy to SAP HANA, select the “Publish” option available on the secondary click of the different 
nodes of the hierarchy (refer to Figure  3-32 ). If SLT is configured, the hierarchy information will be replicated to 
SAP HANA. 
 Figure 3-32.  Publish global hierarchy to HANA system 
 Once published, the hierarchy’s status is changed to “Published” and it is copied to the SAP HANA database. 
 A node in the hierarchy can be deleted only if it is not published or is valid from a future date.

 Benefits of Global Hierarchy 
 The following are the benefits of using the  global hierarchy: 
• 
 Global hierarchy enables to define the structure of an organization distributed 
globally, and gives a single and simple view of their global and plant-level 
performance. 
• 
 Global hierarchy is utilized for reporting and analyzing OEE and production data 
and losses by aggregating the information at the plant level under a region or 
country level. 
     Plant Hierarchy 
 Plant hierarchy is defined for each plant under a global hierarchy. Similar to global hierarchy, plant 
hierarchy is configured by creating hierarchy templates for the plant node.    
 The plant hierarchy model in SAP OEE is a definition of the shop-floor model. The plant hierarchy 
template in SAP OEE is used to define the actual production-line hierarchy for a plant. The template has 
multiple levels so that variants can be created. Only one plant hierarchy template can be used to define the 
OEE hierarchy for a plant. Multiple node types can be configured for a plant hierarchy, the highest level of 
the plant hierarchy must be a plant, and the lowest node should be a machine node (if exist) else it can be 
any other node. 
 The plant hierarchy follows the parent – child node relationships shown in Figure  3-33 . 
 Plant Hierarchy Template Configuration 
 The plant hierarchy template is similar to the global hierarchy template, with a variation in the number of 
nodes that can be configured.  
 
 1. 
 To configure the plant hierarchy template use transaction code SPRO ➤ SAP 
Reference IMG ➤ Production ➤ Overall Equipment Effectiveness ➤ Define 
Hierarchy Template

 3. 
 Select the created template and select Node Type on the left pane. 
 
 4. 
 Node type configuration defines the different nodes applicable for the plant 
hierarchy.

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
60
 Now all the nodes of a plant hierarchy are created and ready for publishing to OEE. Let us review the 
additional information that you will need to configure for each node of the plant hierarchy. 
 Plant hierarchies have multiple configurations for each node. You can configure the specific options 
based on the business requirements. 
 For example, a plant may have a requirement to calculate and monitor OEE KPI at the line level and 
collect data at both machine and line levels. Also, for every line node, different KPIs may be applicable, as 
each node has a specific classification category for use in HANA analytics. All these requirements can be met 
in plant hierarchy node configurations. 
 
■ Note  Currently, OEE standard KPIs are calculated at work center level only. 
 Let us now see the details of each configuration option under the different tabs of the plant hierarchy.  
 Details Tab 
 This tab defines the basic details like the validity of the plant node, a description of the node in the 
configured language, and the status of the node, as shown in Figure  3-43 . 
 Figure 3-42.  Configure plant hierarchy nodes 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
61
 Validity details: 
 The validity period of the plant hierarchy. Ideally, the Valid From date would be the date of hierarchy 
creation. However, you can define a specific validity period as shown in Figure  3-43 . 
 Status: 
 The status of the plant hierarchy can be New, Published, Revised, or Deleted.  
 New ➤ Plant hierarchy node is created. 
 Revised ➤ Plant hierarchy node is modified. 
 Deleted ➤ Plant hierarchy node is marked deleted. 
 Published ➤ Plant hierarchy node is published to OEE. This status is a 
prerequisite to transfer the data from SAP ERP to SAP MII. 
 Texts: 
 You have to select the desired language and add a description for each node type. You can use this 
feature to maintain the description of the node type in different languages.  
 Reports Production: 
 You can report production at line and machine nodes in a plant hierarchy. For a line node, when “Reports 
Production” is enabled, production can be reported and the standard KPIs are calculated. For a machine node, 
when “Reports Production” is enabled, production can be reported, but no KPIs are calculated.    
 
■ Note  Report production is enabled for a machine node only if its work center’s line behavior is configured 
to a “Multi-capacity single line” scenario. In this case, production can be collected and reported at every 
capacity level. 
 Figure 3-43.  Configure plant hierarchy: details tab 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
62
 To report production for a particular node, you need to assign the associated PP work center and 
capacity category from SAP ERP that you want to refer to. This gives information about calendar and shifts 
applicable to that node, and allows you to refer to the capacity of the associated work center. This reference 
also enables OEE to download the production orders relevant to the work center.
• 
 Production can only be reported at one node of a hierarchy branch if the reporting 
node represents a single-capacity work center. 
• 
 For example, consider a hierarchy where line 1 reports production and represents 
a single-capacity work center. Machine 1 and machine 2 are the child nodes of this 
line. In this case, machine 1 and machine 2 cannot report production. However, if 
line 1 does not report production and is not assigned to a work center, its child nodes 
machine 1 and machine 2 can report production, and represent two separate work 
centers’ capacities. 
• 
 If a node is marked as reporting production and is assigned a multi-capacity work 
center, then its child nodes can also report production. They can be assigned to the 
individual capacities of the parent work center. You can do this by assigning the 
individual capacity to the child nodes in the Reference to Work Center Capacity section. 
 Orders that use individual capacity are dispatched according to the corresponding 
hierarchy node. 
• 
 For example, consider a multi-capacity work center, WC1, with two individual 
capacities, M_1 and M_2. For a production order, if the total quantity has been 
split into individual capacities, then these split quantities are dispatched to the 
corresponding SAP OEE machine (capacity) nodes. These quantities are available at 
the machine nodes representing M_1 and M_2 on the OEE dashboard.    
 Reference to Work Center Capacity: 
 Work center: You need to assign the PP work center that is configured for 
planning, production, and costing purpose. 
 Capacity Cat.: Here, you need to assign the capacity category type of the work 
center being assigned. 
 Standard Rate Field:  You can specify the standard rate of production using one 
of the standard value keys defined for the work center. Alternatively, you can also 
specify material-specific standard rates under the standard rate tab. When specified 
in both places, the standard rate field under the Details tab takes precedence.  
 Use Shift Breaks: 
 Every work center has the shift definitions in ERP. When the “Use Shift Breaks” option is checked, any 
shift breaks configured and existing in the shift definitions for the work center will be considered by OEE for 
OEE KPI calculations. Shift breaks will be accommodated as part of the loading time. 
 Aggregate Globally: 
 Select the “Aggregate Globally” option for a node if you want to include data reported at that node for 
KPI aggregation at the global level.  
 For example, production is reported only at the work center node, and hence KPIs will be calculated at this 
node. However, you want KPI calculated at the work center node to be aggregated at its parent node, team. 
 You can check this option for a child node only if its parent node is checked for this option. For example, 
the team node can be checked with this option only if the area node is checked with this option.  

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
63
 You will need to create custom KPIs using KPI configuration to configure it here. 
 KPI Type, UOM, and Validity: 
 Under this section, you can define for a KPI its type, unit of measurement (UOM), and validity period. 
KPI can be positive, negative, or bi-directional based on the KPI being configured. These value ranges are 
used while generating analytic reports and on the real-time operator dashboard. You can define the unit of 
measurement for the KPI, along with its validity period (refer to Figure  3-44 ). 
 KPI Value Ranges: 
 Here, you can specify the target ranges of the KPI as per your plant requirements in the respective colors 
of red, yellow, and green, depending on the severity. 
 For example, you can set the OEE KPI targets as follows:
 80 to 100 as green (higher/safe limit) 
 70 to 80 as Yellow (value limit before critical) 
 0 to 70 as red (critical value limit) 
 This target definition is reflected in the OEE KPI monitoring window of the OEE operator dashboard. 
 KPI Targets tab 
 The KPI Targets tab allows you to configure the standard and custom KPIs to be calculated and monitored 
for the selected node, and to define the KPI targets, KPI to be measured for a specific material (optional), KPI 
validity, type, and UOM.  
 KPI Targets: 
 Under this section, you can define the key performance indicators (KPIs) and their validity period for 
both standard and custom KPIs. The KPI definition can be material specific. If material is not specified, the 
KPI target is considered for all the materials (refer to Figure  3-44 ). 
 Figure 3-44.  Configure plant hierarchy: KPI Targets tab 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
64
 Classification Tab 
 Classification helps you to define the technical information about a node, which can be further used in 
analytics. 
 Hierarchy Node Classification: 
 This tab provides a mechanism for defining a category of classification with which multiple nodes in 
a hierarchy can be associated. This can be used as an additional dimension in the analytics for comparing 
performance across comparable assets in the plant hierarchy or across plants. 
 For example, if you want to compare the mixing process of two similar plants, say, that are producing ice 
cream, you can define the variant/category under classification as the Mixing work center, and this can be 
configured to multiple nodes such as line, machine, and so on (refer to Figure  3-45 ). This signifies that they 
are part of the Mixing variant/category. By doing so, in HANA, performance comparison analytics can be 
generated specific to this variant for the configured nodes.  
 Figure 3-45.  Configure plant hierarchy: classification tab 
 The prerequisite is to define these variants under Create Node Classification, which will be covered in 
section: Hierarchy Node Classification below. 
 Standard Rates Tab 
 Production typically produces a product at the defined rate of speed or, in other words, at the “standard rate.” 
This standard rate is material dependent. OEE KPI requires speed loss as one of the inputs to determine the 
standard “Performance” KPI. Speed loss is determined or calculated using the standard rate.  
 For a node at which you want to report production, you must define the standard rate (refer to Figure  3-46 ). 
Specify the time period for which the standard rate is valid. The standard rate is defined for a material. You 
can associate the relevant Task List Type, Routing/Recipe Group, and Operation/Activity. Define the nominal 
quantity that should be produced in a particular duration. To do this, in the Standard Rate section specify: 
• 
 Quantity and its UoM 
• 
 Duration and its UoM 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
65
 For example: 100 litres of quantity is produced in 15 minutes 
 
■ Note  If quantity and duration with the UoMs are not specified here, you cannot start the order operation 
from the OEE Dashboard. 
 The UoM you specify here must be same as the UoM, or one of the alternate UoMs, maintained in the 
material master data. If the UoMs are different, quantity entered through the OEE dashboard cannot be 
confirmed in ERP. 
 Alternatively, you can specify the standard rate on the Details tab (in Standard Rate Field). In that case, 
OEE obtains the standard rate from the production or process order. 
 Similarly, you can add standard rates for multiple materials. 
 Bottlenecks Tab 
 Typically, a bottleneck is the slowest machine/machines or process/processes that limits the production of a 
line, reducing its nominal speed.  
 You can optionally mark a machine node as a bottleneck. Ideally, the machines are defined as 
 bottlenecks . 
 
■ Note  Definition of a machine being a bottleneck is a plant-specific requirement. OEE allows you to 
configure single, multiple, and multiple parallel bottleneck machines for a line. 
 Figure 3-46.  Configure plant hierarchy: Standard Rate tab 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
66
 The nominal speed of a line is limited to the nominal speed of a bottleneck machine or process. 
Maximizing the bottleneck speed enables an increase in maximum capacity and a reduction in or avoidance 
of additional investment. Operators should be aware of which machine is the bottleneck and that the 
performance of this machine is critical to line productivity. 
 Hence a bottleneck must be identified for each line, each product (or group of similar products). 
For any given line, there can be one or more bottlenecks. OEE has the configuration option to decide how 
the line is affected based on the bottleneck machine’s behavior. 
 The bottleneck configuration can be for a specific material or for a combination of material, task 
type, routing/recipe, operation/activity, or phase. If a node is configured as a bottleneck, its parent node is 
considered to be down whenever the bottlenecked node is down. 
 For example, when a machine node is defined as having a single bottleneck for a line, when it is down 
OEE marks the line as down, and the availability KPI is affected. When a non-bottleneck machine is down, 
availability KPI is not affected. Similarly, multiple bottleneck scenarios can also be handled in OEE using the 
customization configuration. 
 As in Figure  3-47 , when configuring bottlenecks, you need to specify the following:
• 
 Material for which the node is a bottleneck (if not specified, its considered a 
bottleneck for all materials produced in that line) 
• 
 Task List Type (optional) 
• 
 Routing/Recipe (optional) 
• 
 Operation (optional) 
• 
 The data collection element through which this bottleneck node’s downtime will be 
captured 
• 
 Validity period 
 Figure 3-47.  Configure plant hierarchy: Bottlenecks tab 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
67
 Technical Objects Tab 
 You can use the Technical Objects tab (refer to Figure  3-49 ) for a machine node to associate a machine with 
the existing functional location and the equipment of the plant maintenance module and thereby trigger PM 
notification upon machine failure.  
 Machine Groups Tab 
 The Machine Groups tab enables the logical grouping of the machines, similar to hierarchy nodes. The 
logical grouping acts as an additional dimension for comparing the performance of comparable machines in 
the plant hierarchy across multiple plants. Machine groups are applicable to the machine node only.    
 For example, a machine group could be created to specify the vendor of the machines, or machines with 
similar functionality supplied by different vendors, and so on, so that similar machines’ performance can 
be compared, and different machines from a specific vendor can be compared for performance, acting as a 
source to identify the defects. 
 To configure a machine group, you need to create the machine group (please refer to Figure  3-48 ) using

 OEE, being a platform for capturing the machine’s availability using the plant hierarchy, may require 
the use of the plant maintenance module to initiate the plant notification scenario. 
 
■ Note  SAP OEE 1.0 (in SAP MII 15.0) does not support plant maintenance integration and notification, but 
the Technical Objects tab is a placeholder for the plant notification scenario. A custom development can be done 
in MII to automatically trigger the PM notification in the event of a machine node failure. 
 From SAP MII 15.1, technical objects are used, which enables the operator to trigger notifications from the OEE 
operator dashboard. Refer to chapter   8 . 
 Under the Technical Objects tab, add the functional location, the associated equipment, and the validity 
period. Ensure that the functional location and its equipment list are configured for the OEE plant. 
 Now the details of all the plant hierarchy configurations applicable for every node are completed. 
 Save and publish the plant hierarchy by selecting the plant node (refer to Figure  3-50 ) which will send 
the Plant Hierarchy to the SAP MII system configured as logical system.

 Node Delete 
 You can delete a node only if:
• 
 The node is not published or is valid from a future date. When you delete such a 
node, the node details no longer exist in the system, and events are not reported. The 
node is marked as deleted in the  plant hierarchy. 
• 
 All downtimes reported either on the deleted node, or its parent or child nodes, are 
reported up. There are no orders running on the node or its parent or child nodes. 
This needs to be ensured manually before deleting the node. 
 Refer to Table  3-2 to understand the configurations applicable to each node.

 Reason Codes 
 A shop-floor machine can fail or go down for various reasons, like functional failure, material unavailability, 
operator unavailability, line failure, failure of another machine, and so on. Hence, capturing the right reason 
for the failure is essential. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
70
 Reason code is an identifier that uniquely identifies the reason why a machine is failed or down. Reason 
codes are the key piece information regarding the losses captured on the shop floor. They aid in performing 
a downtime analysis, a root-cause analysis, for every event. 
 Shop-floor machines are not intelligent enough to report the reason for their failure. Hence, it is a 
manual operator’s decision to assign the right reason code at the right time for every machine or line failure. 
 Hence, OEE defines the reason code as master data, and it is represented in a hierarchical format along 
with the type of loss associated with the event. These reason codes are assigned to specific plant hierarchy 
nodes to avoid drilling down every time when assigning reason codes to losses. 
 Reason codes for specific time-element types will be displayed to the user. For example, any loss-of-
time element types ( UNSCD_DOWN and  SCHED_DOWN ) at the line node of the plant hierarchy are directly linked 
to the availability KPI. Therefore, the reason code specific to availability losses are linked to the line node 
and the machine affecting that line. 
 Similarly, for performance losses, the system calculates speed loss based on the standard rate 
maintained and production reported, and the user can manage and assign different reason codes. 
 The reason codes are downloaded to the OEE framework for the operator’s use. The operator, using the 
dashboard, links the actual event with the right reason code and reports it to the OEE framework. Here are 
some guidelines:
• 
 Reason codes are defined in ERP and are mapped to existing plants in ERP. 
• 
 Reason codes are configurable with ten tiers of parent – child relationships; i.e., up to 
ten levels. 
• 
 Reason codes specific to global hierarchy are defined at the first three levels. 
• 
 Reason codes specific to plant hierarchy are defined from levels four through ten.  
• 
 A set of reason codes is defined for each type of loss (time and material losses) 
applicable as per the shop floor. Every loss is defined as a data element type in ERP. 
For example,  UNSCD_DOWN is a standard time element type, but one can create custom 
ones too. Based on the plant and the data collection element, reason code hierarchy is 
displayed. For example (refer to Figure  3-51 ), a line can be down for multiple reasons. 
A line down ultimately affects the line’s availability, which further affects production.  
 To capture this,  UNSCD_DOWN (downtime loss) is defined as a data element type, and a set of hierarchical 
reason codes is assigned to this data element type. Therefore, when a line is down, OEE understands it as an 
availability loss, and it accordingly affects the availability KPI value. 
 KPI is calculated based on the time element type. Reason codes are maintained with time element type. 
Based on context, corresponding reason code hierarchy is made available for assignment. 
 The same data element type can be associated with multiple nodes, with a different set of reason codes 
applicable to each node. 
 As in Figure  3-51 , you can understand how the data element type  UNSCD_DOWN is used for different nodes 
with different reason code assignments. In OEE, the reason codes can be defined specific to each node 
under General configuration/Reason code configuration. In the absence of this configuration, the complete 
reason code hierarchy is displayed for the operator to choose and assign the right reason code. 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
71
 Figure 3-51.    Reason code categorization       
 Reason codes can be maintained specific to plant and client and are integrated from ERP down to their 
respective plants. At the plant level, different plant hierarchies and their nodes can have different reason 
codes than their counterparts (other plants). 
 Global Reason Codes 
 This section will detail how to configure the  reason codes.  
 
 1. 
 Use transaction code SPRO and open SAP Reference IMG ➤ Production ➤ 
Overall Equipment Effectiveness ➤ Define Global Reason Codes 
 
 2. 
 The global reason codes are the first three tiers of the reason code hierarchy and 
define the enterprise level of reason codes across plants. 
 
 3. 
 Select New Entries to enter a reason code. 
 
 4. 
 Enter the reason code name. Typically, you can define reason codes specific to 
the data element of type time loss. 
 
■ Note  Data element types belonging to loss-type categories should be configured before creating the global 
and plant reason codes. 
 
 5. 
 In this example, let us create the reason codes for availability loss; 
i.e., unscheduled downtime (refer to Figure  3-52 ). 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
72
 a. 
 Enter the reason code name:  DWNT_LOSS 
 b. 
  Catalog, Code group, and Code should be used when you want to link the 
OEE reason codes with the existing Quality Management reason codes. 
 a. 
 From 15.1, there are two new parameters added namely  Mark for 
Deletion  and  Sequence Number .  Mark for Deletion  is checked when 
you want to delete the created reason code. The same will be updated 
in OEE when sent from ERP.  Sequence Number is the number that 
indicates the order of sequence for the reason codes to be displayed 
under a level. 
 c. 
 Assign the data element of unscheduled downtime to Type.  UNSCD_DOWN is 
the standard data element type. 
 d. 
 Enter a description. 
 
■ Note  For availability/performance/quality loss, the data element type assigned should be the same 
throughout the reason code hierarchy; i.e.,  UNSCD_DOWN data element type should only be used across the 
reason codes for machine or line downtime. 
 
 6. 
 Now the reason code for level 1 is complete. Select the created Reason Code 1 
and select the Global Reason Code Level 2 in the left-hand hierarchy, then select 
New Entries. This will take you to the sub-dialog to create the reason code for 
level 2, which is associated with level 1 (refer to Figure  3-53 ). 
 Figure 3-52.  Configure reason code level 1 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
73
 
 7. 
 Follow step 5 to define the reason code level 2. You can maintain the same reason 
code name or choose a new one as per your plant requirements. You can also 
create multiple reason codes at each level to accommodate varied reason code 
requirements. 
 
 8. 
 Follow step 5 to define the reason code for level 3 (refer to Figure  3-52 ). 
 
 9. 
 Save the reason codes. 
 
 10. 
 Refer to Figure  3-54 for a view of global reason codes configured from tier 1 to tier 3.  
 Figure 3-53.  Configure reason code level 2 
 Figure 3-54.  Configure reason code level 3 
 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
74
 Plant Reason Code Configuration 
 This section will detail how to configure the reason codes for a  plant hierarchy. 
 
 1. 
 Go to the SAP Easy Access menu and choose Logistics ➤ Production ➤ Overall 
Equipment Effectiveness ➤ Master Data ➤ Plant Reason Code.  
 
 2. 
 You can see the reason code hierarchy structure from level 1 to level 10. The first 
three levels are configured with global reason codes, as discussed in the previous 
section. In this section, we need to configure plant reason codes for levels 4 to 10. 
 
 3. 
 Go to Global Reason Code Level 3 and select Reason Code 3, for which you want 
to configure the plant reason codes. Select Plant Reason Code Level 4 from the 
hierarchy, then select New Entries. 
 
 4. 
 Enter the plant name (refer to Figure  3-55 ). The same reason code can be 
assigned to different plants using this plant assignment.   
  Figure 3-55.  Configure reason code level 4 
 
 5. 
 Enter the Reason Code Level 4 Type and Description values as we did for global 
reason codes. 
 
 6. 
 Follow the same steps to configure each level of reason codes as per the plant 
requirements. 
 
 7. 
 Save the plant reason codes. 
 
 8. 
 Refer to Figure  3-56 for reason codes configured up to level 5.  

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
75
 For a machine or line down in the mixing line whose data element type is  UNSCD_DOWN , an 
operator will be shown the reason codes configured for Reason Code Level 5. 
 Follow the preceding steps to configure up to level 10 as per the plant requirements.  
 Upload Plant Reason codes 
 In the previous section, you learned how to manually configure reason codes. OEE also allows a mechanism 
to upload the reason codes via an Excel spreadsheet with a predefined XML format. 
 
 1. 
 From the main OEE menu, select Upload Reason Codes (refer to Figure  3-57 ). 
 Figure 3-56.  Configure reason code for all levels 
 Figure 3-57.  Configure reason code from Excel 
 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
76
 
 2. 
 Click the Upload button and upload the Excel file, which should be in a 
predefined XML format. You can get the standard XML format from the 
information page for Reason Codes Upload in OEE add-on. Also, you can use the 
following Excel file with columns as specified. 
 
 3. 
 The columns are  Client ,  Plant ,  Reason_Code1  to  Reason_Code10 ,  Description , 
 QM_Catalog ,  QM_Catalog_Grp ,  QM_Catalog_Code ,  Type , and  GRUND . 
 
 4. 
 The preceding picture is the standard format that needs to be followed for the 
reason codes. You can refer to the previously entered sample data to add all the 
reason codes as per your plant requirements for all the reason code levels. 
 
 5. 
 Leave the field empty under the reason code levels where the entries should 
be empty. 
 For example, in the preceding picture, the  REASON_CODE1 column has a value and all 
the other reason code level columns are left empty. OEE understands this row to be 
the configuration for reason code 1 and that all the other reason code levels should 
be empty. Similarly, enter all the reason codes in the Excel file where appropriate.  
 
 6. 
 Save the file in XML spreadsheet (*.xml) format. Once saved, the file can be 
opened both in XML and in .xls format. 
 
 7. 
 Select the “Merge Entries Into Table” option for the first-time upload 
(refer to Figure  3-58 ). 
 Figure 3-58.  Upload reason codes 
 
 8. 
 Select “Overwrite Entire Table” if you want to overwrite an existing reason 
codes table. 
 
 9. 
 Click the Execute button. 
 
 10. 
 Notice the successful execution message. 
 
 11. 
 Go to the plant reason codes under the SAP menu to check whether all the 
uploaded reason codes are available. 
 Refer to Figure  3-59 for an overview of the reason code hierarchy accommodating both global and 
plant reason codes. Level 1 to level 3 are the global reason codes, and from level 4 to level 10 are the plant 
reason codes.

 ALE Customizing Settings in ERP for Integration with OEE 
 This section will explain the steps required to set up the configuration in ERP to transfer OEE-related data 
from ERP to OEE.  
 The previous sections explained the OEE-relevant master data and configuration data that is required 
by the SAP OEE application for collecting shop-floor data and calculating OEE and its associated KPIs. 
 These data sets need to be transferred to SAP OEE through IDocs using MII message services. This is 
achieved through ALE customizing settings in ERP. 
 ALE (Application Link Enabling)  is a methodology in SAP by which SAP systems can communicate with 
each other. ALE achieves this communication using a message-based architecture. In this architecture, the 
application layer creates an interface between the systems, the communication layer makes the remote call 
to the logical functions, and finally the distribution layer distributes the data from the sender system to the 
receiver system using filter functions. 
 ALE ensures guaranteed delivery between the sender and receiver systems. ALE can be used for the 
migration, maintenance, and exchange of master data, configuration data, and transactional data. 
 
NOTE
 ALE Application Layer  
 This layer provides ALE with an interface to ERP so as to originate or receive messages containing data 
to or from external (or other ERP) systems. The medium of interface for this data transfer is called an 
 IDoc  (intermediate document), which is a   container  for the application data to be transmitted. After a 
user performs an SAP transaction, one or more IDocs are generated in the sending database and passed 
to the ALE communication layer. 
 Figure 3-59.  Reason code hierarchical structure 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
78
 ALE Communication Layer  
 The communication layer performs a   remote function call  (RFC) using the   port  definition and RFC 
destination specified by the customer model. ALE communications are carried out both synchronously 
and asynchronously. Synchronous message transmissions are typically used for the direct reading 
of control data, while asynchronous message transmissions are used for transmitting or receiving 
application data. 
 ALE Distribution Layer  
 The distribution layer filters and converts messages containing data based on predefined or custom-
defined rule sets. The IDoc is transmitted to the receiver, which may be an ERP, an SAP system, or some 
external system. 
 Every IDoc has exactly one control record along with a number of data records and status records. The 
control record has the details of sender and receiver and other control information. Data records contain 
the actual business data to be exchanged, while the status records are attached to IDoc throughout the 
process as the IDoc moves from one step to another. 
 ALE scenarios fall into three categories: master data, transactional data, and control data distribution. 
Although the underlying principles are the same for the different categories, there are differences in their 
functions and configurations. 
 ALE Customizing Settings in ERP for Communication with MII 
 The list of activities you need to do in ERP for ALE customizing settings are as follows:
• 
 Define RFC destination 
• 
 Maintain a logical system 
• 
 Define a logical port 
• 
 Maintain a partner profile 
• 
 Maintain a customer distribution model 
 Define RFC destination 
 ERP needs an RFC destination in order to communicate with a target system; in this case it is SAP OEE.

 Logical System for ALE 
 A  logical system (LS)  is the representation of an ERP or external system in SAP ERP for the distribution 
of data to and from the ERP system. Every ERP client used for ALE has to have a base LS associated 
with it. This LS becomes the “sender” for outbound messages and the “receiver” for inbound messages. 
In addition to the base LS, an additional LS should be created within that ERP system for each ERP or 
external system used for ALE interfaces. In an inbound ALE interface, this second LS represents the 
sender (another ERP or external system, say, SAP OEE) with respect to the base LS (receiver). In an 
outbound ALE interface, this second LS is the receiver on behalf of the ERP or external system (SAP OEE) 
with respect to the base LS (sender). 
 Logical System Configuration 
 The purpose of this activity is to create a logical system for the SAP MII (OEE) system. 
 To enable communication between systems (ERP and OEE [MII]) within the system landscape, the 
following steps must be configured in ERP to create and maintain the logical system.
 
 1. 
 Log on to the SAP ERP system. 
 
 2. 
 Define the systems as logical systems. 
 
 3. 
 Assign the logical system for the SAP ERP system to a client.     
 Figure 3-63.  Create RFC destination: gateway options 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP

 This enables the systems to recognize the target system as an RFC destination. If the logical system has 
already been created, this activity can be skipped. Logical systems are defined cross-client.

 Partner Port 
 A port is a logical representation of a communication channel in SAP, with the data communicated being 
IDocs. The types of ports that can be defined in ERP are tRFC, File, CPI-C, ABAP-PI, and HTTP. ALE can use 
all port types to distribute IDocs. tRFC and File ports can link to RFC destinations connected to ERP-to-ERP 
or TCP/IP.

 Partner Profile Configuration 
 A partner profile is an identifier for a system used for communicating messages. The type LS (logical system) 
is used for ALE communications. Every partner profile used for ALE must be based on an existing LS. 
 A partner profile brings together several ALE elements to define the parameters of communication 
between two or more systems. Inbound parameters, outbound parameters, and message control need to be 
configured for every IDoc message that needs to be handled. The main parameters are message types, IDoc 
types, process codes, partner functions, application identifiers, message functions, output types, and ports. 
Other parameters also determine the mode of processing and error handling. 
 Figure 3-65.  Create logical port 
 

CHAPTER 3 ■ THE SAP OEE ADD-ON COMPONENT OF ERP
85
 A partner profile plays a major role and can be viewed as a gateway for ALE communications. It routes 
the specified messages through defined IDoc types to a given port after invoking the appropriate function 
modules for outbound processing. It receives IDocs of a specific type, and it identifies modules with which to 
post data to the application databases in the case of inbound interfaces.

 Message Type 
 A message type represents the application message exchanged either between ERP systems or between 
ERP and an external system. A message type characterizes the data sent across systems and relates to the 
structure of the data, called an IDoc type. For example, MATMAS is a message type for Material Master, and 
LOIPRO is a message type for a Production order.  
 IDoc Type 
 An intermediate document (IDoc) type represents the structure of the data associated with a message 
type (MATMAS05 for message type MATMAS — Material Master, and LOIPRO01 for message type LOIPRO —
 Production order), while an IDoc itself is an object containing the data of a particular message type. IDocs 
are data containers with intelligence built in. Each IDoc contains one and only one business object.     
 For example, an IDoc of type LOIPRO01 and message type LOIPRO contains data only for one 
production order. Generally, the architecture of an IDoc is independent of the message type by virtue of 
ALE’s ability to redefine it for any message type. 
 Table  3-3 shows the list of message types and associated IDoc types used by SAP OEE for master, 
configuration, and transaction data

 Customer Distribution Model 
 In an ERP system, the customer distribution model is a tool that stores information about the flow of 
messages across various systems. The customer distribution model uses an SAP-delivered distribution 
reference model as its basis (the customer distribution model can have distribution scenarios other than 
ones stored in the distribution reference model). The customer distribution model stores data that dictates 
the message (message types) flow to its logical systems. Many messages can flow to one logical system, 
and one message can flow to several systems. With the use of filter objects and listings, it is also possible to 
specify in a model the criteria for filtering information for a specific system. A customer distribution model 
can be created in an ERP system with that client’s base logical system as the “sender” logical system.

 CHAPTER 4  
 SAP OEEINT for Integration of 
ECC and OEE 
 SAP OEE consists of different components on SAP ERP, MII and HANA, and it is important to integrate them 
so that the information flows seamlessly, enabling an end-to-end solution. In this chapter you will learn how 
SAP ERP is integrated with SAP MII along with related configurations to be done in SAP MII. 
 As all the master, planning, and configuration data for SAP OEE are maintained in SAP ERP, which 
you learned about in the previous chapter, the integration of SAP ERP with SAP MII is important for getting 
the relevant data to SAP MII and sending the actuals back to ERP from MII after execution. As part of the 
SAP OEE solution, SAP provides a component on MII called  SAPOEEINT   (OEE Integration) that is used to 
synchronize the data between ERP and MII. As you have learned, SAP ERP sends the messages for master, 
configuration, and planning data via IDoc messages, while MII uses IDoc Message Listener, which is a 
standard feature, to receive the IDoc messages and process them, and to save them in the OEE database 
in MII. However, when MII sends the confirmation and goods-movement messages back to ERP, it uses 
the RFC and BAPI interfaces available in ERP, which are triggered from the MII Business Logic Services 
transactions through the OEEINT framework. All the messages flowing between ERP and MII can be 
monitored from the Queue Monitor, which is available in OEEINT on MII. The OEEINT architecture is 
shown in Figure  4-1 . 
 Figure 4-1.  SAP OEEINT  architecture 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP OEEINT FOR INTEGRATION OF ECC AND OEE 
92
 There are three types of data transferred between ERP and MII for OEE through the OEEINT framework, 
as below. The individual data elements were explained in chapter   3 :
• 
 Configuration Data: Configuration data set up in ERP for OEE as follows:
• 
 Data collection elements contexts 
• 
 Data collection elements 
• 
 Data element types 
• 
 Data elements 
• 
 KPI definitions 
• 
 Machine groups 
• 
 Production modes 
• 
 Production activity 
• 
 Hierarchy node classifications 
• 
 UoM and dimension 
• 
 Shift definitions and break schedules 
• 
  Standard value key and formula parameters  
• 
 Factory calendar 
• 
 Master Data: Master data set up in SAP ERP for OEE as follows:   
• 
 Plant hierarchy data 
• 
 Reason codes (loss tree) 
• 
  Work center and capacities 
• 
 Material 
• 
 Transactional Data: Transactional data generated in ERP and MII for OEE as follows:   
• 
 Production orders 
• 
 Process orders 
• 
 Process/production order confirmations 
• 
 Goods movements 
• 
 Maintenance notifications 
 Except for order confirmations, goods-movement data, and maintenance notifications — which, being 
actuals, are sent from MII to ERP — all messages are sent from SAP ERP to MII. 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP OEEINT FOR INTEGRATION OF ECC AND OEE 
93
 Configuration Templates for OEEINT 
 To integrate SAP MII with ERP for using OEE, you need to configure the connections and message routing 
between the two systems. Though it is possible to configure each object individually, it is much easier 
to configure the same automatically by executing a configuration template (CTC wizard), available in 
NetWeaver Administrator in MII server, that is delivered by SAP. After the MII server is installed with the 
OEE components, open the NetWeaver Administrator by the URL:  http://<host>:<port>/nwa . Navigate to 
Configuration ➤ Scenarios ➤ Configuration Wizard and search for  *OEE*  in the filter expression. You can 
find four CTC templates available to set up OEE, as shown in Figure  4-2 . 
• 
 The  SAP OEE NetWeaver Configuration template creates the users and roles required 
for SAP OEE. 
• 
 SAP OEE Integration Configuration template creates the configurations for OEEINT; 
i.e., message workflows and related configurations. 
• 
 SAP OEE Configuration template creates the OEE dashboards, activities, and related 
configurations in MII. 
• 
 SAP OEE Migration template is only used to migrate an older version of OEE to a 
newer version after a service pack or release upgrade. 
 You need to execute the SAP OEE NetWeaver Configuration CTC first, followed by the SAP OEE 
Integration CTC and finally the SAP OEE Configuration CTC. 
 Figure 4-2.  SAP OEE CTC templates 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP OEEINT FOR INTEGRATION OF ECC AND OEE 
94
 SAP OEE NetWeaver Configuration CTC 
 The SAP OEE NetWeaver Configuration CTC creates the relevant roles and users in NetWeaver User Management 
Engine (UME) required for OEE on MII. To start the configuration wizard, select it and click on Execute.     
 In the first step you need to specify the passwords for  OEE_ADMIN and  OEE_INTEGRATOR users, as shown 
in Figure  4-3 , and click Next. 
 Figure 4-3.  SAP OEE NetWeaver configuration: step 1 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP OEEINT FOR INTEGRATION OF ECC AND OEE 
95
 In the next step, you need to specify the host details of the OEE instance with the HTTP/HTTPS protocol 
as applicable, hostname, and port where MII is installed and click on Next, as shown in Figure  4-4 . 
 Figure 4-4.  SAP OEE NetWeaver configuration: step 2

 Finally, click the Finish button, which will create the necessary users and roles for SAP OEE in the 
NetWeaver UME of the MII server. 
 The following users are created in UME:
• 
 OEE_ADMIN 
• 
 OEE_INTEGRATOR 
 Table  4-1 shows the UME roles created for OEE.

 SAP OEE Integration Configuration CTC 
 This section will describe how this CTC configures SAP MII and integration-related SAP OEE elements for 
SAP OEE and SAP ERP integration and post-CTC execution procedures.     
 To configure the OEEINT component, select and execute the SAP OEE Integration Configuration CTC 
wizard. In the first step, you need to specify the JRA configuration details using the OEE component from 
MII that will execute the RFC/BAPI interfaces in ERP, as shown in Figure  4-5 . You can specify a new JRA 
connection factory name along with the SAP ERP server details, which will be created as a JCA Factory in 
NetWeaver Administrator under Configuration ➤ Infrastructure ➤ Application Resources menu.

 Figure 4-6.  Supported OEE plant configuration 
 In the next step, you need to specify the plant code configured in SAP ERP,  OEE_INTEGRATOR user 
password, the ERP client for the plant, and the JRA connector name, which will be created in NWA from the 
connection factory, as shown in Figure  4-6 . You also need to specify the server time zone for the ERP and set 
the OEE Time Zone to be the time zone where the plant is located.  
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP OEEINT FOR INTEGRATION OF ECC AND OEE 
98
 Figure 4-7.  NetWeaver instance and IDoc listener configuration 
 In the next step you need to specify the IDoc listener details, which will be configured in MII to receive 
IDoc messages for the specified plant from ERP, as shown in Figure  4-7 . In MII there are ten IDoc message 
listeners, provided as XMIIIDocxx (where xx stands for 01 to 10), one of which you need to select and then 
specify the MII server host name and port. You also need to specify the ERP server details and the RFC 
destination configuration in the ERP server, which is used by the ALE configuration to send the IDocs to MII, 
as explained in chapter   3 . 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP OEEINT FOR INTEGRATION OF ECC AND OEE 
99
 In the next step you need to specify the scheduler job configurations for OEE by specifying the number 
of messages and the time period of execution, as shown in Figure  4-8 . By default the time period of the 
scheduled jobs is specified as 0 * * * * *, which signifies that the job will execute once every minute at the 0th 
second, which you can change if required. There are a total of four schedulers defined for OEE. 
 Figure 4-8.  OEE schedulers configuration in MII 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP OEEINT FOR INTEGRATION OF ECC AND OEE

 Figure 4-9.  Pre-XSLT parameter configuration 
 In the next configuration step, you can specify the control keys of operations in the production or 
process order that are relevant for OEE as pre-XSLT transaction parameters, if required. You can leave it 
blank if all operations in the order are relevant for OEE, as shown in Figure  4-9 . If you specify the control 
keys, use a semicolon to separate multiple control keys e.g. ControlKey=ZR02;ZR03. You can also specify the 
same thing using the workflow configurations in OEEINT. 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP OEEINT FOR INTEGRATION OF ECC AND OEE 
101
 That will bring you to the last step of this CTC configuration wizard; clicking on the Next button will 
complete the configurations for OEEINT. 
 Once the CTC wizard execution is complete, the JRA connections and IDoc listeners are configured in 
NetWeaver Administrator, and certain configurations for OEEINT are created in MII, which will be explained 
in the next section. 
 OEE Integration Configurations 
 This section will explain the configuration details of OEEINT in MII, which is required to process ERP’s 
OEE-related data. Once you have executed the CTC wizards for OEE roles and OEEINT configurations, log 
in to SAP MII using the URL  http://<host>:<port>/XMII/Menu.jsp . The OEE-specific menus are available 
under the ERP-Shop Integration for Worker UI and Worker UI Management menu categories. 
 Global Configurations 
 The global configuration provides certain configurations required globally in OEE, as shown in Figure  4-11 . 
You can access it from the ERP-Shop Floor Integration ➤ Global Configurations menu. The global 
configuration properties are as follows: 
• 
 SAPOEEINT_RETRY_RETENTION_PERIOD – The time in minutes after which the system 
retries a failed message in OEEINT workflow. 
• 
 SAPMPM_UOM_CONVERSION_TXN – Deprecated not used anymore 
• 
 SAPMPM_ASYNCH_ENQUEUE_TXN – Deprecated not used anymore 
 In the next step, the user can check the “Select to Enter CSV Parameters” checkbox to enable the fields 
for entering the FTP location where CSV data files will be generated by OEEHANAAggregationService. The 
user can provide the FTP location and the frequency of execution of the scheduler, as shown in Figure  4-10 .

■ Note   The SAP MII content for OEEINT is provided by a predelivered project named  SAPMPM that is 
deployed during the OEE component installation. It contains all the data queries, business logic, and XSLT 
required for OEEINT. You can view the content of the project from the MII workbench. 
 Supported Plants Configurations 
 Supported plants configuration provides the configurations related to each plant for the OEEINT setup, 
as shown in Figure  4-12 . You can access it from ERP-Shop Floor Integration ➤ Supported Plants menu. 
This configuration is mandatory in order to use an ERP plant in OEE, and it is created automatically when 
the OEE Integration CTC is executed for a plant. You can view and change the ERP client, language, JRA 
connector factory name, and the time zones of ERP and MII servers from this configuration.

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP OEEINT FOR INTEGRATION OF ECC AND OEE 
103
 IDoc Message Listener Configurations 
 Once you execute the OEE Integration CTC wizard, the IDoc listener gets configured in NetWeaver 
Administrator, along with the JRA connectors, to receive IDoc messages from ERP.    The IDoc listener is a 
JRA resource adaptor that is configured in NetWeaver Administrator. You next need to update the IDoc 
message listener configuration in MII from the Message Services ➤ Message Listeners menu, as shown in 
Figure  4-13 . You need to select the IDoc listener that was specified during the CTC execution and click on 
the Update button to update its configurations in the NetWeaver resource adaptor. Unless the IDoc listener 
configuration is updated in MII, it won’t be able to receive any IDoc messages from ERP. 
 Figure 4-13.  IDoc message listener configuration 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP OEEINT FOR INTEGRATION OF ECC AND OEE 
104
 Processing Rule Configurations 
 Processing rules   are used in SAP MII to process incoming messages from external systems through the 
Message Services. A processing rule is created by the OEEINT CTC wizard named  XMIIIDOC01_ALL_MESSAGES , 
as shown in Figure  4-14 . It is used to categorize IDoc messages received from SAP ERP to be processed by 
the OEE schedulers. All the IDoc messages are tagged with the message category  SAPOEEINT_INBOUND_QUEUE , 
a queue from which the OEE scheduler queries the messages and processes them using the corresponding 
OEEINT workflows. The processing rule is configured for the IDoc message listener specified in the OEEINT 
CTC wizard configuration and for all messages (specified by use of *).

 Workflow Configurations 
 To transfer  the   messages that are exchanged between SAP ERP and MII, message workflows are provided 
in OEEINT, which manages the message processing, transformation, and updating in the OEE database. 
Message workflow is a framework developed as part of OEEINT where preconfigured message workflow 
configurations are provided for the standard ERP interfaces supported in OEE. You can also add new 
messages and enhance existing workflows. There are three types of workflows available in OEEINT:
• 
 Standard Workflow 
• 
 Split Workflow 
• 
 Correlation Workflow 
 Standard workflow  is used to process a message incoming to MII, and after transformation and 
validations as required it sends the message to the destination system; i.e., OEE database or SAP ERP. 
  Split workflow  is used to split a single message into multiple messages based on the message 
content; e.g., material master message sent from SAP ERP for multiple plants is split into multiple 
messages for each plant. 
 Correlation workflow  is used to merge multiple messages together based on the message content to 
generate a single message; e.g., production yield confirmation messages sent for the same order multiple 
times are merged together and sent as a single message to SAP ERP. 
 However, in OEEINT only standard workflow is currently used for the predefined message 
workflows. You can access the Workflow Configuration from the MII Admin Menu ➤ ERP Shop-Floor 
Integration ➤ Workflow Configurations menu as shown in Figure  4-16 . For each workflow, the message 
type is mandatory, and this signifies the name of the message. Based on the workflow type selected, 
the workflow handler is automatically specified with a standard Java program provided by SAP in MII 
for OEEINT. A workflow handler parameter is specified to provide input parameters for the handler 
program. Multiple input parameters can be specified separated by semicolon (;), with the corresponding 
values either hard coded or set as XPath expressions from the source message. The retry limit (also 
mandatory) is specified for the number of times the message will be retried in case of error while 
processing.  

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP OEEINT FOR INTEGRATION OF ECC AND OEE 
107
 Lifecycle Methods of Standard Workflow 
 Each message workflow has a few lifecycle methods with which the messages are processed in OEEINT. The 
lifecycle methods are executed in a sequence, processing the source message or message from the previous 
step and generating the output message. The source messages, which are XML messages, are queried from 
the Message Service or OEEINT outbound message queue (database table) and added to the processing 
queue of OEEINT, from which the corresponding workflow is executed based on the message type. The 
lifecycle methods are as follows and are executed in the same sequence as shown:
• 
 Pre-XSLT Transaction – You can specify a BLS transaction or a Java program to 
validate or enrich the source message before transformation. This is an optional 
configuration. 
• 
 Request XSLT Address – You can specify an XSLT file to transform the source 
message to the target message structure; i.e., IDoc message to OEE message and OEE 
message to BAPI structure. This is a mandatory configuration.  
• 
 Post-XSLT Transaction – You can specify a BLS transaction or a Java program to 
validate or enrich the transformed message. This is an optional configuration.  
• 
 Service Transaction – You can specify a BLS transaction or a Java program to 
dispatch the message to the destination system; i.e., to SAP ERP by RFC call or to 
OEE by API call. This is a mandatory configuration. 
• 
 Response XSLT Address – You can specify an XML-Style Language Transformation 
(XSLT) file to transform the response message received from the service executed in 
the preceding step; i.e., RFC or API call. This is an optional configuration. 
 Figure 4-16.  Workflow configurations in OEEINT 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP OEEINT FOR INTEGRATION OF ECC AND OEE 
108
• 
 Pass Handler Transaction – You can specify a BLS transaction or Java program to be 
executed when the message processing is successful. You can provide any logic here 
to trigger a follow-up action or logging. This is an optional configuration.  
• 
 Fail Handler Transaction – You can specify a BLS transaction or a Java program to 
be executed when the message processing encounters an error. You can provide any 
logic for alert notification on error or logging. This is an optional configuration.     
 Enhancing Standard OEEINT Workflow 
 For each lifecycle method there are  Partner and  Customer lifecycle methods available, which you can use to 
enhance the standard lifecycle methods of the OEEINT workflows. The methods provided as default cannot 
be changed, but you can specify the partner method that will overwrite the default method, or a customer 
method that will overwrite the default or partner method if present. For each of the lifecycle methods, you 
can also pass parameters if required.  
 To add a partner or customer extension to the lifecycle method, you need to develop a BLS transaction 
in SAP MII workbench or write a Java program implementing a specific interface, as shown in Figure  4-17 . 
The parameters of the BLS transaction are as follows:
• 
 inputXML is the inbound message XML 
• 
 params is the BLS parameters of the service specified in the workflow 
• 
 plant value gets retrieved from the queued message XML using the XML path of the 
plant parameter of the “Workflow Handler Parameters” field.  
• 
 recordId is a GUID of the message in the SAPMEINT integration queue

 Inside the BLS transaction you need to develop the logic to parse the input XML document, do the 
required validation and enhancements, and pass the output XML with the enhanced or validated data. If 
any exception needs to be thrown to signify an error, you need to assign a string with value  SYS_ERROR in the 
output status property. If the processing is successful then you need to specify  PASSED . 
 Most of the services and XSLT for the lifecycle methods of the OEEINT workflows are provided by 
default, but there may be some scenarios for which you need to enhance the standard lifecycle method of a 
workflow for an interface to add additional data or validations when transferred from SAP ERP to MII or vice 
versa some scenarios of which you will learn in Chapter   7 . 
 Transfer of Data from ERP to OEE 
 To transfer the configuration, master, and transactional data from SAP ERP to SAP MII via the OEEINT 
framework, you need to log in to SAP ERP and use the specific transactions available there to send the 
messages to SAP MII. The prerequisite configurations, which you need to do in SAP ERP before you can 
transfer the data, are explained in Chapter   3 , and the configurations in SAP MII are explained in this chapter 
in an earlier section.

 Figure 4-21.  Transfer configuration data to OEE 
 Except for the shift, UOM, and plant hierarchies, all other workflows for OEE-specific configuration 
and master data have additional workflows with different message types for data reconciliation. As you 
execute the transaction, IDoc messages will be generated and will be transferred to SAP MII to the OEEINT 
framework, where they will be processed by the corresponding OEEINT workflows. 
 You can transfer the process order or production order data from SAP ERP to SAP MII (OEEINT) using 
the transaction code POIT or the SAP Easy Access menu: 
 Logistics ➤ Central Functions ➤ Supply Chain Planning Interface ➤ Production Optimization (POIT) 
➤ Send Movement Data 
 Similarly, as in the previous transactions, you need to specify the logical system for SAP MII, and 
optionally the plant and date range, with the production order selection to send the data to SAP MII to be 
processed by OEEINT. 
 

CHAPTER 4 ■ SAP OEEINT FOR INTEGRATION OF ECC AND OEE 
115
 Queue Monitor 
 You can view the messages transferred through OEEINT in the Queue Monitor provided in SAP MII as part 
of OEEINT, which you can access from MII Admin menu ➤ ERP Shop Floor Integration ➤ Queue Monitor. 
From the Queue Monitor you can monitor the individual messages sent from ERP or MII for OEE, as shown 
in Figure  4-22 . You can search by specific message name (Document Type), timestamps, process status, 
identifier, or correlation key.  
 You can display the messages that are processed by OEEINT with their attributes. A message is retried 
automatically if it fails in processing depending on the number of retries specified in its corresponding 
workflow. 
 Figure 4-22.  OEEINT Queue Monitor 
 For each message, you can view the message content XML as well by selecting the message and clicking 
on the Trace button. It displays a pop-up with the different messages generated during the processing, such 
as the source message or the original document received in MII, the request message generated by OEEINT, 
and the response message received from ERP or OEE. You can select one of the messages and click the View 
button to display the message XML, as shown in Figure  4-23 . You can also retry processing a message by 
clicking the Retry button, which will execute the workflow for the selected message.

 CHAPTER 5  
 OEE Configurations in SAP MII 
 In the last chapter, you learned how MII acts as an integration platform between SAP ERP and OEE 
components in SAP MII and the OEE CTC configurations for setting up OEE integration. 
 As a continuation of Chapter   4 , this chapter will cover the various roles and authorizations and OEE 
configurations in SAP MII OEE component required to execute OEE standard functionality. 
 User Roles and Authorizations 
 Every action that a user is allowed to perform is governed by the role they are assigned. Hence, you need to 
create the user roles as per the plant requirements and assign the required actions to these roles. 
 User roles and authorizations in OEE are configured in three systems:
• 
 SAP ERP 
• 
 OEE Integration and Services (NetWeaver Java/SAP MII)  
• 
 SAP HANA 
 User Roles for SAP ERP 
 Refer to Table  5-1 , which lists the authorizations required in  SAP ERP to work on OEE-related data 
management. Each authorization object is assigned an authorization type to execute specific OEE 
transactions. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII
118
 User Roles for OEE Integration Services in SAP MII 
 SAP OEE, similar to SAP MII, utilizes the authorization concept provided by SAP NetWeaver where users are 
assigned specific roles. Each role has specific actions assigned. 
 By default, SAP OEE delivers the following roles, and each role can perform specific OEE actions:
• 
 OEE_OPERATOR 
• 
 OEE_SUPERVISOR 
• 
 OEE_INTEGRATOR 
• 
 OEE_ADMIN 
• 
 OEE_SUPERADMIN 
• 
 OEE_READ_ONLY 
 In SAP OEE, the users are authorized for OEE-related actions specifically for a plant – client combination 
in SAP ERP. Users can perform OEE operations only for the plant and SAP client, which he or she is 
responsible for. In addition to this, you can define the default SAP client, plant, dashboard, and work center 
that the user would like to view upon logging on to the system. 
 To configure this, go to Identity Management ➤ Configuration in SAP NetWeaver UME 
( http://<host>:<port>/useradmin ). Choose the User Admin UI tab and select Modify Configuration. Specify 
“SAPOEE:DEFAULT CLIENT; SAPOEE:DEFAULT PLANT; SAPOEE:DEFAULT WORKUNIT; SAPOEE:DEFAULT 
POD; SAPOEE:ERP PERSONNEL NUMBER” in Administrator Managed Custom Attributes field and save the 
entries. Once this configuration is done, for each user you can set the values for client, plant, work unit, and 
dashboard in the Customized Information tab, as shown in Figure  5-1 . Now when the user logs in to the OEE

system, the default SAP client and plant will be displayed, while other clients and plants can also be selected, if 
configured for the user.  
 Default client and plant do not have to be mandatorily mentioned in the Customized Information tab 
from MII15.0 SP05 release onwards (if the OEE Dashboard is invoked by URL directly and not from MII 
menu), as these details can also be sent via URL parameters directly — for example, ( http://<host>:<port>/
OEEDashboard/WorkerUI.jsp?client=<client  id>&plant=<plant id> ) — but the user group to which 
the particular user belongs should be assigned to a particular plant, which can be done in the General 
Configuration tab. Refer to the section on “General Configuration” later in this chapter for details. 
 User roles and authorizations for the  HANA layer   will be explained in Chapter   9 . 
 SAP OEE CTC Wizards 
 In Chapter   4 , you learned that configurations of OEE are performed using CTC wizards. You also learned 
about using SAP OEE NetWeaver Configuration CTC and SAP OEE Integration Configuration CTC to set up 
the integration component between ECC and OEE. In this section, you will learn the SAP OEE Configuration 
CTC and SAP OEE Migration CTC, which are used to set up the entire configuration as well as migration 
from earlier releases, when required, in SAP MII. 
 In addition to the above-mentioned CTCs, additional CTCs are introduced, such as SAP OEE Demo 
Plant Master Data Setup CTC and SAP OEE Demo Plant Order Data Setup CTC. 
 The SAP OEE Demo Plant Master Data Setup CTC creates ERP-related master data in SAP MII and, 
together with SAP OEE Demo Plant Order Data Setup CTC, provides a sample OEE framework that you can 
use for demo purposes without setting up data and configurations in SAP ERP. Refer to chapter   8 to set up 
the demo plant. 
 Figure 5-1.  Configure OEE default values for user 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII
120
 SAP OEE Configuration CTC 
 SAP OEE Configuration  CTC setup creates the following OEE configurations in SAP’s supported languages:
• 
 Default order status and its description 
• 
 Default activities and their descriptions 
• 
 Default dashboards, default configured button with standard UI activities, 
descriptions 
• 
 Default customization parameters under general configuration with their permitted 
default values (where applicable) and descriptions    
 To execute the OEE Configuration CTC, open  http://<server>:<port>/nwa ➤ Configuration ➤ 
Scenarios ➤ Configuration wizards and search for *OEE* in the filter expression. You will find four CTC 
templates available to set up OEE, as shown in Figure  5-2 . 
 You need to execute this CTC for every new plant – client setup in SAP ERP. Select “SAP OEE 
configuration” from the list and click on Start (if executing for the first time) or on Re-execute if you are 
executing it again. Specify the SAP ERP client and the plant (plant needs to exist in SAP ERP) and click on 
Next, as shown in Figure  5-3 .

 SAP MII Configurations for SAP OEE 
 SAP OEE uses operator dashboards as a single window for the different OEE users — namely, operator, 
supervisors, planner — to perform their operations. You can configure these dashboards to suit your shop-
floor requirements. To do this, SAP OEE provides the following set of worker UI configurations to maintain 
the data required for order execution and KPI calculations:
• 
 Display ERP system data 
• 
 General configuration 
• 
 Activity configuration 
• 
 Dashboard configuration 
• 
 Modify order status description 
• 
 Scheduled downtime maintenance 
• 
 Order dispatch 
• 
 Review shift 
• 
 Review order 
 As shown in Figure  5-12 , you can learn how the various worker UI configurations contribute to framing 
the OEE dashboard. You need to maintain these configurations using the respective worker UIs in order to 
develop the desired operator dashboard. 
 Figure 5-11.  SAP OEE Migration CTC: step 5 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII
126
 All the preceding configuration menus are available in SAP MII Admin Menu ➤ Worker UI Management 
menu group, as shown in Figure  5-13 . 
 Figure 5-12.  Worker UI configurations for OEE dashboard 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII
127
 SAP MII 15.1 provides additional menu for Worker UI Configuration which is explained in Chapter   8 . 
 Display ERP System Data 
 You can access  Display ERP System Data to view the plant hierarchy, with node-specific configurations, that 
was configured in the SAP ERP OEE add-on module. It is non-editable and acts as a reference for OEE-specific 
master and configuration data. For example, the ERP System Data worker UI is a ready reckoner of plant – client-
specific configurations, such as the hierarchy nodes, KPIs defined, standard rates defined for each line, list of 
machines, bottlenecks, work center and its capacity details, and so on, as shown in Figure  5-14 .  
 Figure 5-13.  Worker UI configurations menu 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII
128
 Refer to Figure  5-15 to see the plant hierarchy structure, which is defined in ERP and transferred to OEE. 
If the MII server is configured for multiple plants, then all the hierarchies in a plant – client combination are 
displayed here. 
 Each node is displayed with a unique node ID, which is created whenever the plant hierarchy is 
transferred to SAP OEE for the first time. This node ID reference is essential for all OEE scenarios and to 
work on any custom developments specific to each node. You can view these node ID references during the 
Display ERP System Data configuration. For example, to report a downtime, you need a machine’s node ID 
reference. To report a production count, you need the line node ID reference. 
 Against each node, there is a set of properties displayed. The top pane refers to the Details tab of the 
plant hierarchy in the OEE add-on. All the other tabs are displayed in the bottom pane. The Bottlenecks tab 
defined against the machine node in the plant hierarchy is displayed here within the Mark Parent Down tab. 
 Figure 5-14.  Display ERP System Data: line node 
 Figure 5-15.    Display ERP System Data: machine node       
 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII
129
 In SAP OEE, a line (parent node of a machine) is reported as down automatically when a bottleneck 
machine(s) is down. A line can be reported as down for a single or multiple bottleneck scenarios, which is 
user defined and based on the configuration of a customization parameter. 
 General Configuration 
 General configuration is one of the key worker UI configurations to use when defining your dashboard 
functions; it has the following four sections:
• 
 User-group dashboard assignment 
• 
 Assignment of operator dashboards to a specific user group responsible for a 
work center; alternatively, from MII 15.1 user can assign dashboard at plant-
level node and all work centers under that plant will get the same operator 
dashboard assigned 
• 
 Customization configuration 
• 
 Define various customizations to achieve the standard OEE functionalities 
• 
 Reason code configuration 
• 
 To assign loss-specific reason codes for easy reason-code assignment in 
operator dashboard 
• 
 Extension configuration 
• 
 To assign the standard extensions or custom enhancement logics as an 
extension, or to hook points to standard OEE service methods 
 Dashboard Assignment to User Group 
 It is an essential requirement in manufacturing plants to define role-specific operator dashboards. Each 
operator or supervisor is responsible for specific activities, and hence must use specific dashboards for order 
execution. This varies from work center to work center. SAP OEE works using the user-group concept. All 
users, such as operator, supervisor, plant manager, planner, and so on, may have to perform specific role-
based actions in the OEE dashboard. In the following section, you will learn how the users who are part of 
OEE user groups are assigned OEE dashboards. 
 User Administration in SAP OEE 
 In Chapter   4  you learned about the various OEE-specific roles created by the SAP OEE NetWeaver CTC 
execution in NetWeaver UME —OEE_SUPERADMIN ,  OEE_ADMIN ,  OEE_OPERATOR , and  OEE_SUPERVISOR , as shown 
in Figure  5-16 . Each of these OEE roles are by default assigned with specific OEE actions. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII
130
 There are a few user groups for SAP OEE, which get created by the CTC wizard in NetWeaver UME, as 
shown in Figure  5-17 . 
 Dashboard Assignment in OEE 
 SAP OEE allows the assignment of dashboards based on user groups only. For each user group, assign 
specific OEE roles as discussed in the previous section, which in turn are assigned with specific OEE actions. 
Custom OEE roles can also be defined with permission to perform specific OEE actions. A work center node 
 Figure 5-16.    Identity management: OEE roles       
 Figure 5-17.  Identity management: OEE user groups 
 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII
131
under a plant hierarchy, which executes an order-operation and reports data, can be configured with a user 
group and a dashboard for that user group. 
 Since SAP MII Release 15.1 it is also possible to assign a dashboard to a plant-level node; if this is done 
then the user will have access to all work centers of that plant from the OEE dashboard. 
 
■ Note  Only unique user groups with different dashboards can be assigned to a work center node. Using 
different dashboards, a user can report data or monitor data at the work center node. Hence, if a user has 
multiple roles, say, supervisor and operator, he must be assigned to both those OEE user groups to access a 
dashboard for a work center. 
 You can create, edit, and delete the configured user-group dashboard assignments. 
 Configure user group dashboard assignment:
 
 1. 
 In the SAP MII Menu page, go to Worker UI Management ➤ General 
Configuration. Select the work center node and select the User Group Dashboard 
Assignment tab. 
 
 2. 
 Click Add. 
 
 3. 
 Refer to Figure  5-18 . Click the Filter button. The SAP UME user group and 
Dashboard drop-downs appear. The SAP UME user group drop-down lists all the 
user groups available in NetWeaver UME. The Dashboard drop-down lists the all 
standard and custom-configured OEE dashboards available in the system. You 
will learn about OEE dashboard configurations in the next chapter.   
 
 4. 
 Select the desired user group and select the dashboard. 
 
 5. 
 Click Add, and the user group dashboard assignment is added. Save the 
assignment as shown in Figure  5-19 . 
 Figure 5-18.  User group dashboard assignment: add dashboard 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII
132
 All the users belonging to the  OEE_ADMIN_GROUP user group will now be able to access the assigned 
dashboard when selecting the specific production line. 
 Customization Configuration 
 SAP OEE, for the benefit of users, has provided 26  customization parameters that can be used to customize 
the way you perform the node-specific operations and display data in the OEE dashboard. By default, these 
parameters are assigned with a default value (wherever applicable) when all OEE master and configuration 
data are downloaded from ERP. Later, you can set the custom values for each of the following parameters as 
per your requirements:
 
 1. 
 Allowed Modification Limit 
 
 2. 
 Allowed Time Limit for Starting Ord. in the Past 
 
 3.

 Customization configuration helps you set up how you want to monitor the OEE dashboard and in 
some backend logic and calculations. 
 For example, the Minor Stoppage Limit parameter helps you to set the duration limit of how long a 
machine downtime or line downtime event must be for it to be considered minor. The Minor Stoppages 
Should Be Included in Availability parameter, when set to  Yes , ensures the backend KPI calculations include 
minor stoppage durations in the Availability KPI. 
 Customized values can be set for any of the nodes. When they are set at the plant-node level of the 
hierarchy, they are by default applicable to any child nodes. Upon defining customized values for child 
nodes, these values take precedence over the customization value set at parent node. Customized values can 
be set as being specific for material or as being non-material specific. Refer to the appendix for the details of 
each of these customization parameters. 
 Reason Code Configuration 
 Reason codes are OEE master data created in the SAP ERP OEE add-on and transferred to SAP OEE. Reason 
codes are defined for each of the hierarchy nodes and  data collection elements (DCE) of loss types. In 
Chapter   3 , you learned about the reason code configuration for plant levels, which appear as a hierarchical 
structure. When these reason codes are transferred to OEE, they are displayed as the complete hierarchy in 
OEE dashboard. Hence, the operator has to pass through the complete hierarchy to select the right reason 
code, while assigning it to an event such as machine downtime or material scrap declaration. 
  Reason code configuration allows you to configure the most applicable reason code for each data 
collection element and for each machine and work center node that is reporting production. From the whole 
of the reason code hierarchy, you must select the relevant subset of reason codes to be assigned. These 
configurations are reflected on the OEE dashboard when assigning reason codes for data collections of loss 
types. This helps the operator to choose the right reason code quickly. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII

 To configure reason codes for dashboards follow these steps:
 
 1. 
 On the SAP MII main menu, choose Worker UI Management ➤ General 
Configuration ➤ Reason Code Configuration tab  
 
 2. 
 Select the work center or machine node and select “Add” 
 
 3. 
 Select the data collection element from the drop-down for which you need to 
define the reason code. These are listed from the data maintained in the ERP 
OEE add-on. Refer to Figure  5-20 . 
 
 4. 
  Click on the “Assign” link and select the level, that which is more relevant, as 
shown in Figure  5-21 . 
 
 5. 
 Click Add and then Save. 
 
 6. 
 The data collection element – specific reason code is configured as shown in 
Figure  5-22 .

 7. 
 Now, in the OEE dashboard, when you report the waste DCE and click on the 
“Assign” link to assign the reason code, you will find only the above-configured 
reason code available for assignment, as shown in Figure  5-23 . 
 Extension Configuration 
 In SAP OEE, there are certain standard process events for OEE dashboard activities called methods that 
perform standard OEE functionalities like order start, order complete, report data, and so on.  Extensions   are 
hooks that are added to these methods to trigger standard/custom logic, when it occurs. 
 In SAP OEE, methods are standard functionalities assigned to hierarchy nodes that report production; 
for instance, they could be assigned to a work center node. 
 The standard methods in SAP OEE are as follows:
 
 1. 
 Start order-operation 
 
 2. 
 Stop order 
 
 3. 
 Report data 
 
 4. 
 Resume order-operation 
 
 5. 
 Complete order 
 
 6.

 9. 
 Get OEE KPIs 
 SAP OEE provides standard extensions for ERP confirmations and post-goods-movement for different 
methods. For example, production/process order confirmation in SAP ERP can be triggered upon reporting 
data and upon order completion when done from OEE dashboards. 
 Custom extensions are configured by creating a custom logic developed on SAP MII (BLS transaction) 
and hooked to a standard method. These extensions are executed as an extension to these standard methods. 
 The execution can happen as pre, post or on exception events to these methods. As the OEE extensions 
work as extensions to the existing standard methods/logics, the standard methods pass the relevant data in 
the form of XML to the standard/custom logic configured as an extension. 
 Refer to the appendix to understand the Input/output XML structure to be followed when using 
extensions. 
 Configure extensions:
 
 1. 
 On the SAP MII main menu, choose Worker UI Management ➤ General 
Configuration ➤ Extension Configuration 
 
 2. 
 Select the work center node for which you want to configure custom extensions.  
 
 3. 
 Select the Add button in the top pane to add a standard method from the drop-
down. Refer to Figure  5-24 . 
 
 4. 
  Select the method and from the bottom pane click the Add button. 
 Figure 5-24.  Extension configuration: add service method 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII
137
 
 5. 
 Add the extension type as PRE/POST/EXCEPTION.
• 
 PRE: Extension logic is executed before the execution of standard method. 
• 
 POST: Extension logic is executed after the execution of standard method. 
• 
 Exception: Extension logic is executed upon exception of standard method.     
 
 6. 
 Select the standard or a custom activity and add an extension sequence. 
 
 7. 
 Check “Enabled” and click the Add button to select the language option.  
 
 8. 
 Select the language and add the extension description, then click Add. 
 
 9. 
 Save the configurations. 
 You will learn more about the usage of extensions in OEE dashboards in Chapter   6  (OEE Dashboards) 
and Chapter   7   (Custom Developments on SAP OEE).    
 Activity Configuration 
  Activity configuration   in OEE enables you to create activities of different types that are executable 
components in OEE dashboard. Any OEE functionality like a UI control in OEE dashboard or extension 
logics is using an OEE activity. 
 OEE activities are of four types:
• 
 UI 
• 
 Transaction 
• 
 Extension 
• 
 Java class 
• 
 External App 
• 
 UI Component 
 By default, a set of standard activities is delivered in SAP OEE; these are assigned to the client and 
plant of the logged-in user. The standard activities are created when you execute the SAP OEE Configuration 
CTC wizard. 
 Also, based on specific requirements, you can create custom activities. The custom development details 
of each type of activity will be explained in Chapter   8 .
• 
 UI: It is an activity required in order for a user interface to provide a section or button 
actions on the OEE dashboard. UI-type activities can only be provided by utilizing 
web content developed using SAP UI5 following an MVC approach. 
• 
 Transaction: It is an activity where you execute an MII transaction from a standard or 
custom OEE dashboard. 
• 
 Extension: It is an activity to be used when you need to extend the standard OEE 
functionality. Being an extension, the required input parameters will be passed to 
the extension logic from the SAP OEE standard application. Extension details are 
explained in the “Extension Configuration” section. For example, an extension can 
be a custom logic that you want to execute as an extension to the order start or order 
complete logic of standard SAP OEE. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII
138
• 
 Java Class: A logic component developed on Java that is used to execute any custom 
logic or services provided by SAP OEE.  
• 
 External App: This is an activity type which should be used to view any custom 
dashboard belonging to third party application within the OEE standard dashboard. The 
complete URL of the UI page of external application should be configured as the URL.  
• 
 UI Component: It is a type of UI activity but used for configuring UI objects in 
Application launch pad. From 15.1, Goods Movement (GI and GR) can be executed 
using an Application launch pad. To configure any UI object on this launch pad, the 
activity should be defined as UI component.  
 
■ Note  
 
 1. 
 A custom activity can be used in a standard OEE dashboard, but a standard activity 
cannot be used in a custom OEE dashboard. 
 
 2. 
 From SAP MII 15.0 SP03 onward, custom activity of type UI should use XML views in 
place of JS views, as all the standard OEE dashboards are redesigned with XML views.  
 Activity Configuration Options 
 
 1. 
 On the SAP MII main menu, choose Worker UI Management ➤  Activity 
Configuration.  
 
 2. 
 You can create a new activity or change an existing activity.  
 
 3. 
 To create a new activity, enter the Activity ID. This is a unique ID that should be 
meaningful to understanding the purpose of the activity. 
 
■ Caution   Activity ID should not have any spaces. 
 
 4. 
 On the Main tab, enter the class or URL to the activity, which is deployed in 
SAP NetWeaver WebAS. The class or URL is the reference pointing to the actual 
executable activity code or logic. For standard activities, this field is pre-filled and 
cannot be edited. For custom activities, you need to fill it in with the right URL 
based on the activity type being created. URL is different for each kind of activity.
• 
 Standard OEE activities of type UI start with  sap.oee.ui . For example,  sap.oee.
ui.oeeReviewOrder is the class/URL for Review Order functionality.  
• 
 Standard activities of type Extension start with  com.sap.xapps.oee.extension.
extensions . For example,  com.sap.xapps.oee.extension.extensions.
ErpConfirmationOnDCExtension is the extension for ERP confirmation on 
reporting data collection. 
• 
 Pre-delivered standard activities belong to activity types UI or Extension. Refer 
to Chapter   7  to learn how to configure a custom activity and the class/URL for 
activity of types UI and Transaction. 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII
139
 
 5. 
 On the Activity Description tab, maintain the description of the activity in 
the languages that you want. Currently, eight languages are supported and 
configured in OEE. 
 
 6. 
 Standard activities cannot be deleted and edited, whereas custom activities can.  
 
 7. 
 On the Options tab, you can maintain option name, description, and its value. 
The Options tab is used by a UI activity to define the UI fields in the dashboard to 
collect the data. It can be localized. You can group similar data elements under a 
single activity and display them in an ordered sequence with an associated label, 
and the same is displayed in the operator dashboard for data collection. 
 For example, you can define multiple custom data collection elements in OEE 
add-on and transfer them to OEE. Then, you can create a single custom activity of 
type UI and add all those custom data collection elements under the Options tab 
value section. By doing this, all these custom data collection elements are displayed 
under that activity in the OEE dashboard. 
 For example, you can create a custom activity to collect custom data collection 
elements. 
 Example to Create an Activity 
 
 1. 
 On the SAP MII main menu, choose Worker UI Management ➤  Activity 
Configuration. 
 
 2. 
 Enter a meaningful name for the activity. For example, if you are creating an 
activity to collect line speed set at the shop floor, then you can enter the activity 
name as  Z_SET_SPEED . 
 
 3. 
 On the Main tab:
 a. 
 In the Class or URL field, enter  sap.oee.ui.oeeGenericDataCollection . 
This is an SAP-delivered activity for collecting custom data collection 
elements. 
 b. 
 In the Activity Type field, select UI. 
 
 4. 
 On the Activity Description tab, choose Add to enter a description for the activity 
in the required languages. The description given here appears on the dashboard.  
 
 5. 
 On the Options tab, choose Add to enter the option name, option description in 
the required languages, and the option values, as shown in Figure  5-25 . 
 For this example, specify the option name as  DCELEMENT . 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII
140
 
 6. 
 In the Options Value section, enter the data collection elements that you want to 
use to collect data from the dashboard. To do this, enter a sequence number and 
the data collection element that you have already configured in OEE add-on. You 
can add multiple data collection elements; however, use a different sequence 
number for each data collection element. 
 
 7. 
 Save the activity, and the activity will be listed under the Activity configuration 
screen as shown in Figure  5-26 . 
 Figure 5-25.  Activity configuration: Option tab 
 Figure 5-26.  Activity configuration: create custom UI activity 
 If a data collection element has the context raw material ( RAW_MAT ), then it is recommended that you 
add only one data collection element in the Options Value section for that activity. 
 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII
141
 Standard OEE activities 
 With  activity configuration you can  
• 
 view the pre-delivered standard activities of type UI and extension; and  
• 
 create, edit, and delete a custom activity.   
 Refer to the appendix for the list of standard activities supported by SAP OEE. 
 Standard OEE activities source code can also be downloaded from MII 15.1 and be reused to develop 
custom UI activities for use in the OEE dashboard. Refer to chapter   8 for the steps to download and reuse it. 
 
■ Note  Activity of type Extension should be added to a node method under General Configuration ➤ 
Extension Configuration for each line as per the requirements. For example, if your requirement is to confirm 
yield quantity to ERP after every yield report in the OEE dashboard, then the extension has to be configured and 
enabled. 
 Order Status Description Configuration 
 When a production or process order is executed in OEE, the order operation takes a different status, such as 
NEW, ACTIVE, HOLD, CMPL, and REV.  
 NEW: The order is downloaded in OEE from ERP.  
 ACT: The order is started and being executed in OEE. 
 HOLD: The order is placed under hold or paused. 
 CMPL: The order is completed. 
 REV: The order spans across shifts; i.e., an order is started in one shift, runs 
beyond the current shift, and may be completed in the future shift, in which 
case the order needs to be reopened in the next shift. REV status is planned to 
be enabled in future SPs. 
 OBS: An order that is sent by mistake to OEE, or an order that no longer needs 
to be executed or is marked as obsolete on the shop floor, can be marked as 
obsolete in OEE. An order, once marked obsolete, can no longer be made active, 
and an order can go to the obsolete state only from the hold state.    
 Modifying the order status description configuration helps you to change the order status description 
as per the requirements. It is a simple configuration where you can edit the status description for a specific 
plant and client in a particular language. 
     Order Dispatch 
 Orders (LOIPRO IDocs) are downloaded to SAP OEE from SAP ERP using the OEEINT framework. The 
downloaded orders are by default auto-released and ready for execution in OEE. At times, the plant may 
require a manual release of order quantities based on the shop-floor requirements.  

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII
142
 Order dispatch UI enables you to do the manual release of partial order quantities to specific work 
centers of OEE. To enable the manual release you must add the following line of code in the Request XSLT 
transaction at the end, for the LOIPRO workflow in OEEINT: 
 <automaticRelease>false</automaticRelease> 
 The downloaded orders then will not be automatically released when passing through OEEINT and are 
listed with the order and its quantity in Order Dispatch worker UI. 
 The order can be selected and a partial quantity to be released can be specified in the “Enter quantity to 
release” textbox, as shown in Figure  5-27 . If the order corresponds to a single unique work center, then the 
order is released to that particular work center, after which the order is ready for execution. Sometimes, an 
order is dispatched to a work center that corresponds to more than one node in the plant hierarchy. 
 For example, let’s take a scenario where a material X is produced by passing through machines A, B, 
and C. For a specific variant of the same material X, it has to pass through machines A, B, C, and D. In this 
case, two different work center nodes can be created in the plant hierarchy that are assigned to the same PP 
work center. The first work center node is configured with three machines, A, B, and C, and is assigned to a 
PP work center. Another work center node is configured and assigned to same PP work center but has four 
machines, A, B, C, and D. 
 In this scenario, material X is configured for both work centers in the plant hierarchy, and when an 
order for material X is created and dispatched, the order dispatch UI displays it as corresponding with 
two work centers/operations/nodes. Here, you can select the desired work center and do the partial order 
release. 
 Order dispatch worker UI is applicable when the orders are dispatched and executed based on the 
current demand, material, and labor availability, or when there are material variant options. 
 Scheduled Downtime Maintenance 
 Scheduled downtime is a planned maintenance time for a resource. Downtime for the purpose of 
maintenance is scheduled as a part of the manufacturing day and, in some cases, as an integral part of the 
manufacturing process. It also includes performing routine actions that keep the device in working order. 
The goal is to restrict emergency and unscheduled maintenance to a minimum. 
 The scheduled downtime maintenance worker UI in OEE enables you to maintain the planned 
downtime as part of plant-specific maintenance activities, downtimes, and public holidays. The UI displays 
the plant hierarchy where you can create your scheduled downtime for a particular client and plant and for a 
specific line. The downtime can be created for the work center node. 
 Figure 5-27.  Order dispatch configuration: release partial quantity 
 

CHAPTER 5 ■ OEE CONFIGURATIONS IN SAP MII

 1. 
 Select the work center node in the plant hierarchy for which you want to create 
the scheduled downtime. 
 
 2. 
 Click  Create button and specify the time period during which the line will be down.  
 
 3. 
 Assign the reason code by clicking the “Assign” link. The reason code configured 
for the data collection element  Scheduled_down in OEE add-on for the specific 
plant and client are displayed here. 
 View Existing Scheduled Downtimes 
 
 1. 
 Click on Retrieve button after selecting the required time period in the drop-down. 
All the created downtimes for the selected time period are  displayed 
 
 2. 
 The Load from calendar button option pulls all the scheduled downtimes created 
from the factory calendar. The factory calendar configuration data can be 
transferred as an IDoc to OEE from ERP. 
 
 3. 
 All the created scheduled downtimes can also be deleted and edited. 
 
■ Note  Scheduled downtimes cannot be created in an overlapped time period. Scheduled downtimes can be 
created using this worker UI or using the OEE dashboard, which will be dealt in the next chapter. 
 OEE Configurations Transport 
 SAP OEE stores various configuration data required for the solution, as explained earlier. You can transfer 
these data to a different MII environment using the “Transport OEE configurations” option. 
 To transport the OEE configuration, go to MII Main menu ➤ System configuration ➤ Configurations. 
 Select the configuration data that are related to OEE, as shown in Figure  5-28 . You can select the OEE 
configuration data in addition to the MII configurations and click on Export. Each configuration is converted 
into an XML file. Select the required configurations, enter the pass phrase, and choose Export. Select the 
client and plant for the source and target systems from the popup. The created XML files are zipped. With 
the export method “File System,” the zip file needs to be saved in the desired location in your local client. You 
can then import the saved zip file into the target system. For export method “CTS+” the zip file is transferred 
to the CTS+ system, from which the file is imported into the target system automatically.

 CHAPTER 6  
 SAP OEE Dashboard 
 In the previous chapter, you learned about the various worker UI configurations that influence the modeling 
of OEE dashboards. In this chapter, you will learn the purpose of and the steps to configure OEE dashboards 
and their detailed descriptions. 
 The OEE dashboard is the user interface for the users — operator, supervisor, planner, and so on — in a 
plant to monitor, view, and analyze the shop-floor operations and events. SAP OEE is pre-delivered with 
a few standard dashboards. These dashboards can be enhanced with additional UI options, and new, 
customized dashboards can be configured using the worker UI dashboard configuration. 
 Dashboard Configuration 
 Dashboard  configuration is the worker UI configuration through which you can edit and configure the 
standard OEE dashboard or create your own customized OEE dashboard. An OEE dashboard is built using 
OEE activities of type UI. The UI activities can be standard (pre-delivered by SAP) or custom. As per your 
requirements, you can develop your own UI page, create a custom activity of type UI, and use it in the 
standard OEE dashboard. 
 To view, edit, or create an OEE dashboard, go to MII Admin Menu ➤ Worker UI ➤ Dashboard 
Configuration. The worker UI displays all the plant – client combinations for which you are authorized to edit 
or configure the dashboards. 
 The pre-defined dashboards can be viewed by selecting the dashboard under Dashboard ID and 
clicking the Display button. To configure or customize an existing dashboard, you need to copy the standard 
dashboard and perform the required changes. You cannot directly edit SAP-delivered dashboards.
• 
 To view a dashboard, click Display. 
• 
 To edit a dashboard, click Change. 
• 
 To copy a dashboard, click Copy. 
• 
 To delete a dashboard, click Delete. 
• 
 Click Clear to reset the dashboard selections. 
 Dashboard Configuration Elements 
 OEE Dashboard ID: A unique ID for each dashboard; should not have  spaces  
 OEE Dashboard Name: OEE dashboard description 
 OEE Dashboard Layout: Defines the layout of the dashboard. Currently available 
options are L1 and L3.  

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
146
 OEE Dashboard Description Tab 
 This tab is to define the  description of the dashboard in different OEE-supported languages. This is the 
description that will be displayed every time you access the dashboard; hence, it should be meaningful and 
understandable. 
 You can add and delete entries for different language options.  
 Dashboard Section Content 
 This  section displays the entries based on the layout type selected. For L1, one layout entry can be selected 
(there is no L2 layout, so only L1 and L3 are available), and for the L3 type, three entries can be selected, 
as shown in Figure  6-1 . Within each content section, the standard and custom activities of UI type are listed. 
You can select the required OEE activities, which will be displayed in OEE dashboard in the order they are 
configured here. 
 Dashboard Buttons 
 Apart from the layout, you can define the dashboard  buttons that appear in the footer of OEE dashboard, 
which would open another activity page linked to it. Refer to Figure  6-2 , the dashboard button tab of 
dashboard configuration to edit, delete and configure buttons. You can use “Add Entry” to add a dashboard 
button to add an entry. Buttons can be normal or group type. Normal buttons have a single activity assigned 
and group buttons have multiple activities assigned. 
 Figure 6-1.  Dashboard configuration: dashboard section content 
 Figure 6-2.  Dashboard Configuration: dashboard buttons 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
147
 Dashboard Button Options 
• 
 Button ID: Unique ID for the button being created 
• 
 Activity Assigned: Standard or custom OEE activity to be assigned here from the 
activity list 
• 
 Button Sequence: Defines the sequence of the buttons in the footer. The sequence 
is shown in ascending order for same-level buttons, while for group buttons, the 
sequence starts for the group entries in the same ascending order. 
• 
 Button Type: normal or group
• 
 For group type, do not assign any activity. Once the entry is created, select the 
row and a new screen will be opened where you can add a list of standard or 
custom activities. 
• 
 Location: Bottom (all buttons are placed only at the bottom irrespective of this 
configuration, so this is ignored) 
• 
 Language & Description: Give a meaningful description in the desired language. 
 The UI Extensions tab is obsolete from version 15.0 SP03 onward.    
 Types of OEE Dashboard 
 In this section, you will learn the detailed functionalities and features of each of the pre-delivered OEE 
 dashboards. 
 The standard OEE dashboards are available for use once the OEE-MII component is deployed on 
MII and configured using the OEE configuration CTC. These dashboards are built based on the metadata 
defined in the master data and hierarchy definitions. For instance, OEE dashboards are created and 
maintained specific to a plant and a client. Similarly, master data such as plant hierarchy and reason codes 
are also maintained as plant and client specific. This relationship ensures the display of correct plant – client 
data in standard OEE dashboard. SAP OEE dashboards support the Gregorian calendar. 
 Every dashboard — be it standard or custom — is a collection of logically grouped UI activities (refer to 
UI activities in “Activity Configuration” in the appendix) required to perform the role-specific actions. For 
example, a supervisor may be authorized to review the orders executed during the shift, so he would need 
access to the “Review Order” and “Review Shift” UI activities. Similarly, an operator who manages the order 
and data collection would need access to the “Manage Order” and “Report Production” UI activities. Hence, 
based on the user’s role, the dashboard is to be configured with the required and restricted authorizations to 
these UI activities. 
 To configure the OEE dashboard for specific user groups, refer to the “General Configuration” section in 
chapter   5 . 
 Let’s now look at the SAP-delivered standard dashboards. 
 Plant Monitor Dashboard 
 The  plant monitor dashboard helps you to monitor the plant by monitoring the status of all the configured 
work centers in the plant. You can monitor the status of each work center and its performance with respect 
to an active order running. It also provides all the information about the active order, such as material 
details, order quantity, remaining quantity to be produced, and the quantity produced in the current shift. 
The Details icon navigates to the line monitor dashboard. Refer to Figure  6-3 . 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
148
 The plant monitor dashboard is available as a single UI activity under the activity configuration worker 
UI  ACT_PLANT_MONITOR . 
 Line Monitor Dashboard 
 The  line monitor dashboard helps you to monitor line-specific updates such as the line’s availability, 
machine downtimes that occurred in the shift for the respective line or work center, the reason codes for 
each machine downtime, and the current shift KPI. Also, this dashboard can be viewed from the plant 
monitor dashboard when you want to monitor a specific line for a drill-down report. Refer to Figure  6-4 . 
 Figure 6-3.  OEE dashboard: plant monitor 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
149
 The line monitor dashboard is available as the single UI activity  ACT_LINE_MONITOR . 
 Note the following:
• 
 When the line monitor dashboard is used to drill-down from the plant monitor 
dashboard, it displays the real-time status of the selected line in the plant monitor. 
• 
 When the line monitor is directly accessed by selecting it from the dashboard menu, 
then the line detail is picked from the global context. Global context is the way OEE 
provides all its parameter values for use in OEE dashboard. For more details on 
global context, please refer to chapter   7 . 
 Operator Dashboard 
 When using the  operator dashboard , you can perform all the following operations as an operator:
• 
 Manage orders: start, hold, and completed an order-operation 
• 
 Perform parametric data collection 
• 
 Manage machine and line downtimes 
• 
 Assign reason codes for all production losses 
• 
 Many other data maintenance tasks, such as updating production information for an 
order in the shift 
 The operator dashboard is a key dashboard that contains all the UI activities necessary for an operator 
to work with during his or her shift. This dashboard can be enhanced with other standard UI activities 
as per your requirements. It can also be customized by adding new dashboard buttons, which can be 
used to navigate to a custom OEE dashboard. In this way, the operator gets to view both the standard and 
customized OEE activities from the single UI. 
 Figure 6-4.  OEE dashboard: line monitor 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
150
 
■ Note  Custom OEE activities of type UI can be configured in a standard OEE dashboard (a copy of the 
standard dashboard). In dashboard configuration, you need to edit the standard OEE dashboard after making 
a copy of it. From SAP MII 15.1, you can download the code for the standard UI activity and reuse it with the 
addition of customized code. Refer to chapter   8  on how to download the standard UI activity code. 
 Now, let us see in detail each of the standard UI activities configured in the operator dashboard. 
 Once the user is configured with the OEE dashboard under General Configuration/User Group 
Dashboard Assignment (Refer to chapter   5 for worker UI configurations), the user will be authorized to view 
the configured operator dashboard as a default upon opening the OEE dashboard. 
 The home page of the operator dashboard is shown in Figure  6-5 . 
 Any OEE dashboard will have the following  options as a default:
•

 Shift Selection 
 The  shift selection look-up lists all the shift intervals configured for the selected work center. The shift 
configurations are maintained in ERP, assigned to an OEE work center node of the plant hierarchy using OEE 
add-on, and then transferred to OEE through an IDoc. Refer to Figure  6-8 . 
 You can select any shift interval for a particular date. Once a date and shift are selected, all the shop-
floor data collected and the order-operations executed for the selected shift ID and date are displayed. 
 Current Shift Order 
 The  current shift order pane is an order card (refer to Figure  6-9 ) that displays information about the active 
or completed order-operation, such as the following: 
• 
 Order–operation number 
•

 Current Shift KPIs 
 Current shift KPIs (refer to Figure  6-10 ) display real-time updates of the OEE KPIs, such as availability, 
performance, quality, and OEE. In instances of a current shift selection, the shift KPIs displayed would be 
real-time current KPI values. For the selection of past shifts, the KPI values displayed would be calculated for 
the whole shift. The KPI monitor can also be configured to display additional custom KPIs, and the same can 
be viewed by moving left and right.

 Line Availability Summary 
 The  line availability summary displays the real-time availability of the selected line based on downtimes 
logged for it. The performance strip shows the timeline from the shift duration. For example, if the shift 
selected is Early Shift with the Shift Interval set as 06:00 to 14:00, for the selected shift the strip displays a 
green color for “line available” and red for “line down.” The downtime and uptime are updated in real-time 
at the refresh rate of the operator dashboard. Refer to Figure  6-11 . 
 The line down can be due to the following:
• 
  physical line down raised manually or automatically 
• 
 bottleneck machine down 
 By keeping the cursor on the red portion of the performance strip, you will be able to see the 
approximate downtime durations occurred.

 Dashboard buttons: Manage Orders 
 Upon clicking the  Manage Orders button, a new UI is opened on the same page. 
 The purpose of this UI is to do the following:
• 
 Manage orders–List the downloaded and released order-operations from SAP ERP 
 This UI screen lists all the order-operations, which are downloaded from ERP 
and released in OEE for the selected work center
 1. 
 Associated customization configurations: Date range for order selection : 
 This parameter decides the time duration for which the order should 
be listed in the dashboard. For example, if the selected duration is ten 
days, then the dashboard displays the order whose planned start date 
is ten days before or after the current date. 
 Associated Activity :  ACT_ORD 
 Search for an order using fuzzy logic. Refer to Figure  6-14 . 
 Figure 6-14.  OEE dashboard/manage orders: search orders 
 The  search box is enabled with fuzzy logic whereby an order can be searched for based on any of its 
parameters, such as order-operation number, material number, quantity, UOM, status, start date, planned 
start date, and activity. For example, by entering 78 in the search field, you get the following results because 
of the search term’s match with quantity or any other matching field, as shown in Figure  6-15 . 
 Figure 6-15.  OEE dashboard/manage orders: search orders

 Figure 6-22.  OEE dashboard/manage Orders: resume orders 
 
■ Note  Production and loss data can be reported only for an active order. 
 To resume an order-operation, select the Resume button for an order that is in Hold status. Now the 
order status is updated from Hold to Active, and now you can continue with your order execution. Refer to 
Figure  6-22 . 
• 
 Abort an order 
 An order can be aborted if it is obsolete on the shop floor and is no longer meant to be executed in OEE 
dashboard. An order can only be aborted if it is set to Hold status. To set an order as obsolete, go to Manage 
orders ➤ Filter the Hold order ➤ Order details ➤ click on Set to Obsolete.
 
 
• 
 Change the  production activity for an order-operation 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
159
 An order-operation may pass through multiple activity phases, such as consumption and production. 
In such cases, while starting an order-operation, you can start and change over to different production 
activities that are configured for a work center, as shown in Figure  6-23 . Production activities are explained 
in chapter   3  section Production Activities. 
 Figure 6-23.  OEE dashboard/manage orders: select production activity 
 On starting an order-operation, and if the production activities are configured, you get a pop-up with 
the configured activities available. You can now select the required activity and click OK. 
 To change over from one activity to another, select the current activity for an active order; you get the 
pop-up with the configured activities. Now you can change over to another activity, as shown in Figure  6-24 .

 The Details icon navigates to a new screen containing all the order-operation 
details, such as the following:
• 
 Order overview 
• 
 Order execution details: You can edit the start and completion date time of the 
order-operation. Also, you can monitor the user details.  
• 
 Activity details: View the activity details in terms of start and end timestamps.       
 Associated customization parameter : Shrinking Order Duration Allowed. 
Using this parameter, you can shrink or shorten the order duration by 
editing the start or end timestamp of an order-operation. 
 
■ Note  Within a shift, order duration can only be shrunk but not extended. 
 Dashboard buttons: Manage Downtimes 
 Manage downtime is the UI activity to handle time loss for machines or production lines — i.e., downtimes. 
Downtimes can be reported manually or automatically by API calls in an integrated solution. 
 From the manage downtime UI, you can do the following:
• 
 Report…
• 
 unscheduled machine downtimes 
• 
 unscheduled line downtimes 
• 
 scheduled downtimes 
• 
 flow time 
• 
 View and edit saved downtimes 
• 
 Assign reason codes for downtimes 
• 
 Delete a downtime 
• 
 Split downtimes and assign reason codes for the split downtimes 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
161
 The  search field is used to search the saved downtimes. The search box is similar to the one in the 
manage orders UI where a downtime can be searched based on any of its parameters, like work unit, 
downtime type, user ID, and reason code. 
 For example, by specifying “Pack” in the search field, you get the following downtimes. Refer to Figure  6-26 .  
 Figure 6-26.    OEE dashboard/manage downtimes: search downtimes       
 Minor Stoppages 
 Minor stoppages  are those stoppages that are categorized as non-critical components for the Availability KPI 
calculations. The categorization is defined based on the downtime duration. 
 Associated customization parameter: Minor Stoppage Limit . It is set as ten minutes by default. 
 For example, any stoppage whose duration is less than ten minutes is considered to be a minor stoppage. 
 Minor stoppages should be included in availability you can define whether a minor stoppage should be 
included as part of the availability KPI or not using this customization parameter. 
 How to create a minor stoppage:
 
 1. 
 Minor stoppage limit for the selected work center is set, for example, to five mins. 
 
 2. 
 To report a minor stoppage manually, select the Minor Stoppages tab 
 
 and select “Report New” option at the bottom  
 . 
 
 3. 
 A pop-up lists the work center and the machines that are part of this work 
center. The bottleneck machines are highlighted and differentiated from the 
non-bottleneck machines. Refer to Figure  6-27 .   
 Figure 6-27.  OEE dashboard/manage downtimes: report minor stoppage 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
162
 
 5. 
 Specify the start time and end time (if it’s a past downtime), or select the start 
time for an open downtime by selecting the start and end time textboxes. The 
“Set current” option allows you to directly set the current time. Once the start 
and end times are specified, the duration is automatically calculated, or you can 
define the start time and set the duration by which the end time is calculated, 
and it will be set automatically. Enter comments, if any. Select OK, and the 
downtime is saved under Minor Stoppages tab. Check “Mark Line Down” if you 
feel this machine (whether bottleneck or not) affects the line’s availability, as 
shown in Figure  6-29 and Figure  6-30 . 
 Figure 6-28.  OEE dashboard: select  data collection element 
 
 4. 
 Select the line on which to create the line minor stoppage or select a machine 
from the list to create a machine minor stoppage. In the Type drop-down, you get 
the list of data collection elements created to capture the type of downtime loss. 
Refer to Figure  6-28 . By default, unscheduled downtime is the data collection 
element used. The data collection element acts as an identifier for the system to 
categorize this time loss to the correct KPI. You can select the right reason code if 
you know, else you can select “Skip Assignment.” 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
163
 You can select the created downtime and split it to assign reason codes for each split downtime. 
Minor stoppages cannot be edited and deleted. 
 Check the “Untagged” checkbox to filter and list the downtimes that are yet to be assigned a reason code.  
 Machine Breakdowns 
 This tab is displayed by default when the manage downtime UI is loaded. You can create machine 
downtimes using the “Report New” option. When the downtime duration is less than or equal to the minor 
stoppages limit set, the downtime is saved under the Minor Stoppages tab. If not, it can be viewed under the 
 Machine Breakdowns tab . The saved downtimes can be edited for changes in downtime duration and reason 
codes. You can also assign a root-cause machine for a downtime if the root-cause machine selected is the 
root cause of this line going down. The root-cause machine assigned may or may not be down. You can even 
report the root-cause machine as down during this assignment.
 Filter options : Open downtimes and Untagged downtimes 
 Sorting : Sort criteria are start time, end time, and duration, and sort order is 
ascending or descending. Select the criteria and the order to sort the downtimes 
as per your requirements. 
 Search Field enabled with fuzzy logic enables you to search a downtime on any 
of its parameters, such as work unit, downtime type, reported/changed by, and 
reason code.

 Figure 6-30.  OEE dashboard/manage downtimes: minor stoppage reported 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
164
 Select an open downtime and select “Report Up” to close the downtime event. 
The current time is taken as the Up time for the machine. 
 Split downtimes :  You can split only a closed downtime event. Downtimes are split 
ideally when you feel there are different reasons for the downtime for different 
intervals. For example, for a machine event of 12 hours, say the first 6 hours were 
due to label changeover and the next 6 hours were due to a grease issue.  
 Select a downtime event and click the Split button.    
 Enter the split durations and add as many rows as required by selecting the 
Split button. Ensure the sum of split durations is less than or equal to the total 
downtime duration. Assign the reason codes for each split. Then select OK. 
Refer to Figure  6-31 . 
 Figure 6-31.  OEE dashboard/manage fowntimes: split downtimes 
 The downtimes are split, and if there is any remaining unsplit duration, then that 
duration remains as a separate entry. 
 You can also delete a downtime using the Delete button. 
 Line Down 
 Line down is the unavailability of the production line or work center for production purposes. Line down 
can happen in two ways in OEE:
• 
 Manual/automatic reporting of a line down 
 To create a manual line down, follow the same steps as described in the previous 
section for reporting a machine down. In this case, select the line instead of a 
machine, and for its respective data collection element say “Line_Stoppage” or 
“Unscheduled_downtime.” For this type of line down, a physical record exists 
in the OEE standard tables with a corresponding data collection element. This 
record is displayed in the OEE dashboard under the Line Down tab, and you can 
assign a reason code. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
165
• 
 A bottleneck machine down 
 Report a bottleneck machine down, and based on the customization parameter 
set for “Line Behavior,” the OEE system displays the bottleneck machine that is 
down as a line down. 
 For example, say  AGRO_CHEM machine is a bottleneck machine. On reporting 
 AGRO_CHEM down, the Line Down tab displays this bottleneck machine as down, 
which signifies it as a line down. Refer to Figure  6-32 . For this type of line down, 
the OEE standard table does not have any record signifying the line is down, unlike 
in the previous line-down scenario. Hence, reason codes can only be assigned for 
the bottleneck machine that is down, which signifies the reason code for line down 
as well. 
 Figure 6-32.    OEE dashboard/manage downtimes: line down       
 
■ Note  The line down works based on the customization parameter “Line Behavior.” Please refer to 
customization configuration in chapter   7 . 
 Line downs can be
• 
 deleted; 
• 
 assigned a root-cause machine; 
• 
 filtered based on open downtimes, bottleneck, and untagged; 
• 
 edited for the start and end time timestamps and the reason code; 
• 
 split in a similar fashion to machine breakdowns; if the split duration is less than or 
equal to the minor stoppage limit, then the split line down will appear under minor 
stoppages; and 
• 
 sorted 
 Shared Downtimes 
 In OEE, downtimes are independent of order-operations. The operator on the shop floor is the right person 
to know whether a downtime will affect an order-operation’s KPI or not. As an operator, you can use the 
Shared Downtime tab to assign the order-operation the downtime. 
 OEE allows you to allocate a downtime to either a single order or all orders, if multiple orders exist. 
On allocation of downtimes to an order-operation, the order-specific KPIs are affected accordingly, and 
there is no change to shift KPI. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
166
 Create Shared Downtimes 
 Select the Shared Downtime tab If only one order exists or you want to assign the downtime to only one 
order, select the downtime and select the “Assign to order” option. A pop-up appears with all the existing 
active orders for the selected line. Refer to Figure  6-33 . 
 Figure 6-33.  OEE dashboard/manage downtimes: select order for downtime event assignment 
 Select a single order and click OK. The assigned order-operation is displayed against the downtime. 
Refer to Figure  6-34 . 
 Figure 6-34.  OEE dashboard/manage downtimes: event assigned to order 
 Flow Time 
 Flow time is the time duration for a product to reach to end of line after the start of production. It is non-
productive time which is not part of the loading time. Sometimes, you may need to measure the flow time 
to understand the non production time as otherwise the total time from start to end of line will include this 
non production time which needs to be measured and corrected to get accurate KPI., which helps you to 
understand the performance or capacity of the line producing the product.   
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
167
 Dashboard buttons: Report Production 
 Production is a data collection element of type Yield that collects the actual production and yield data from 
the shop floor. This element directly affects the performance KPI. 
 Good production without any speed loss leads to 100 percent performance KPI. 
 Report production is a standard OEE activity of type UI that collects the production data manually 
through the operator dashboard. The report production UI displays the following:
• 
 Order summary 
• 
 Report production with UOM 
• 
 Report waste 
• 
 Report quality defects 
 To report production/yield, enter the yield quantity and the UOM. All the alternate UOMs for the 
material are listed here. The UOMs come from the UOM T006 table in SAP ERP and are transferred 
to MII. You can select the desired UOM, and if the UOM happens to be not the standard material 
UOM defined in the order, the UOM conversion can be enabled using the global configuration parameter 
 SAP_UOM_CONVERSION_TXN . Save the reported production. 
 You can report other material losses like waste/scrap and quality defects along with production/yield. 
Similar to production, enter the waste quantity and UOM, assign the reason code (if known), add comments 
(if any), and save the entries. You can select the Details button to view the reported production and the 
material losses. Refer to Figure  6-35 . 
 Figure 6-35.  OEE dashboard: report production 
 Once the production is reported, you will see a change in performance KPI value, and once a quality 
defect is reported, the quality KPI is affected. 
 Associated activity:  ACT_REP_QTY 
 Dashboard buttons: Report Speed Loss 
 Speed  loss is a time loss — production at nominal speed taken from production at actual speed. Nominal 
speed is the rated speed at which a product can be produced in a particular work center. This is defined in 
SAP ERP for a material at a work center and is also defined in the plant hierarchy for a work center node. 
 Actual speed/set speed is the speed at which a product is actually being produced. Normally a speed is 
set for each line, which ideally should be the nominal speed. Sometimes that may not be the case, and could 
be greater or lesser than the nominal speed. 
 When the actual speed is lesser than the nominal speed, it is a speed loss, and hence the performance 
of the line goes down or underperforms. In this case, the line should be monitored and decisive action 
should be taken. 
 Speed loss = Production at actual speed – Production at nominal speed 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
168
 In OEE, the time loss due to speed is indicated as an open speed loss in the report speed loss UI. The 
operator needs to assess the situation and accordingly report a speed loss using Report Speed Loss button in 
operator dashboard. 
 For example, refer to Figure  6-36 , where you can see an open actual speed. There is an open time loss 
of 7 hours and 5 minutes. With this, the operator is aware of what length of time was due to a speed loss. 
You can split the total available duration and report a desired speed loss.  
 Figure 6-37.  OEE dashboard: report standard values 
 Figure 6-36.  OEE dashboard: report speed loss 
 To report speed loss, select the “Split” option, enter the time duration in minutes, assign the reason 
code for speed loss, and click OK. The speed loss is reported and displayed here. For a reported speed loss, 
you can attach a root-cause machine if you feel the cause of the speed loss is a machine. You can also link 
other downtime events to this speed loss. This helps in analyzing the history of similar losses so as to take a 
corrective action. Refer to Figure  6-36 . 
 Associated activity:  ACT_SL 
 Dashboard buttons: Report Standard value parameter 
 As part of a process/production order, six standard activities can be defined which are captured during order 
execution as part of production information. These standard value parameters are production activities and 
are captured as time duration which has a production contexts. These standard value activities can be setup 
time, machine hours, labor hours etc as per the business requirements. In OEE, there is a standard activity to 
capture the values manually in the dashboard. 
 To enable the standard activity reporting you need to configure the standard activity ACT_STD_VAL 
in dashboard configuration as a dashboard button. In operator dashboard on clicking the Report Standard 
Activity, you can report the values defined the selected work center as in Figure  6-37 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
169
 Once reported, these values are stored in MPM_PROD_RUN_DATA along with other order specific 
data collections. When the standard order confirmation extension is triggered, these reported values are 
automatically mapped to the ORDER_CONFIRM_BAPI workflow and are updated in ERP. 
 Dashboard buttons: Review Order 
 Review order is a standard OEE activity of type UI where you can view and edit the history of an order-operation. 
 Review order displays order-operation details for all the shifts for which it was active. It displays the

 Standard Functionalities of SAP OEE 
 From earlier chapters and the previous sections in this chapter, you have learned the capabilities of SAP OEE 
and the configurations needed to set up the plant model. To summarize, the following are the  functionalities 
delivered as part of the solution:
• 
 Download and release of order-operation from SAP ERP to MII 
• 
 Execution of order-operation, which includes start, hold, resume, and complete 
an order 
• 
 Order-dependent and order-independent data collections 
• 
 Downtime handling; managing plant maintenance notifications  
• 
 Four KPI calculations in real-time 
• 
 Goods Movement in OEE 
• 
 Update of order confirmation and goods movement back to SAP ERP 
• 
 Real-time monitoring of shop floor through OEE dashboard in SAP MII  
• 
 Near real-time replication of OEE transaction data to SAP HANA    
 You will learn in this section the standard data flow cycle, from the download of an order from ERP to 
the update of operational information back to ERP. You’ll also see how the backend OEE tables are updated 
with these data. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
171
 Download and Release of Order-Operation 
 OEE KPIs are calculated and monitored at the shift level. Each shift executes  order-operation(s).   Hence, the 
first step is to download an order-operation from SAP ERP and release it before its execution. 
 Prerequisite:
 
 1. 
 ALE customization configuration is configured in SAP ERP to transfer the 
production/process order. 
 
 2. 
 OEE Integration CTC is executed to set up the ERP shop-floor integration 
framework. 
 
 3. 
 Material is created and MATMAS IDoc is transferred to OEE. 
 
 4. 
 Work center is created and LOIWCS03 is transferred to OEE. 
 
 5. 
 Plant hierarchy is created for the OEE plant, and the work center is assigned 
to each line node in the hierarchy. Hierarchy is successfully published and 
transferred to SAP OEE (MII). 
 
 6. 
 Production/process order is created using CO01/COR1. 
 Transfer a production/process order from SAP ERP to SAP MII using tcode POIT. The SAPOEEINT 
framework processes the order and inserts the data into OEE tables. Next, ensure order processing status is 
set to Success in the SAPOEEINT queue monitor. By default, all the order quantity is released. You can also 
partially release an order in the order dispatch worker UI. To do this, you need to disable the auto-release 
by enhancing the request XSLT transaction for the production/process order. If you want to capture the 
standard value activities in OEE, then the order needs to be configured with these activities. 
 Tables involved:
 
 1. 
 MPM_RELEASED_DMD_HDR : Order details with partial or full released quantity 
and status. 
 
 2. 
 MPM_RELEASED_DMD : Order-operation details along with order status. Initially 
the status is NEW. Order status is updated from time to time until it is completed 
and the data is updated back to ERP. Also, this table stores both OEE- and 
non-OEE-relevant operation details (based on the pre-XSLT parameter configured 
during CTC execution). OEE dashboard displays only OEE-specific operations. 
You can use non-OEE-relevant operations for non-OEE-specific enhancements.      
 Execution of Order-Operation, Which Includes Start, Hold, 
and Complete an Order 
 The next step is to execute the downloaded and released order-operation. 
 Prerequisite:
 
 1. 
 Configure the user group and dashboard assignment for each work center.  
 
 2. 
 Order is downloaded and released at the work center. 
 In the OEE dashboard, go to Manage orders button and select the order-operation from the list that was 
downloaded. You can start, hold, or complete the order-operation. On start of order-operation, production 
activity can be selected (if it is configured). In the same Manage Orders screen, the production activity also 
can be changed from one to another. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
172
 The order status changes from  NEW to  ACT to  CMPL . The order takes a Hold status if placed under hold, 
and will be resumed from the same screen. Once the order is completed, the order-operation confirmation 
is put into the integration queue if the standard extension  ORDER_CONF_EXT_ACT  is configured for the 
“Complete order” method under the Extension Configuration tab under General Configuration worker UI. 
If it is not configured, the order completion timestamp is updated into OEE tables, Confirmations Enqueuer 
is a scheduler which at the set scheduler frequency checks for any order related data which are pending for 
confirmation and the same are pushed to integration queue using ORDER_CONFIRM_BAPI workflow. The 
 ORDER_CONFIRM_BAPI workflow will pick up these messages and update it to SAP ERP through an RFC call. 
 
■ Note  SAP ERP order confirmations can be configured to be line specific using the customization parameter 
“Enable Periodic Confirmations” upon order completion or upon reporting the data. When not defined, 
confirmation for all the work centers will be triggered by the MII scheduler. 
 OEE  database tables involved:
 
 1. 
 MPM_RELEASED_DMD_HDR : Order status is updated with order start details. 
 
 2. 
 MPM_RELEASED_DMD : Order status is updated with order start details. If an order 
is completed, the end date and time are updated along with the timestamp for 
when the confirmation details were updated to ERP from OEE. 
 
 3. 
 MPM_PROD_RUN_HDR : Once an order is started, a new entry is inserted into this 
table with the status  ACT , along with the order start and end times. The entry is 
given a unique key,  RUN_ID , which helps in reading the table data. If an order 
spans across the shift, the order is automatically marked completed at the end of 
a shift and started again for the new shift. The status in the old shift is updated to 
 CMPL , and in the new shift its status is set to  ACT, and it has a new  RUN_ID . Each 
entry is shift- and work center node – specific. 
 
 4. 
 MPM_PROD_RUN_INT : This production interval table stores the interval of a run 
within a shift; i.e., if a stop gap (hold-resume of an order in a shift) happened in 
a shift for an order once, two intervals would be created — one from order start 
to order hold time, then another from order resume to end time for that shift. 
A change in a production activity also triggers a new interval creation Order-
Dependent and Order-Independent Data Collection 
 During the process of order-operation execution—i.e., after the start and before the completion of 
an order-operation—shop-floor data are collected either manually (through dashboard) or automatically 
(enhancement using OEE APIs). The collected data may be order dependent or order independent. 
 In OEE, the  order-dependent data collections are:
• 
 Production yield/goods quantity 
• 
 Waste or scrap 
• 
 Quality defects 
• 
 Speed loss 
 Order-independent data collections can be any custom data collection element. (The standard product 
does not deliver any order-independent data collection elements.) 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
173
 Whether a data collection is dependent or independent is configured in OEE add-on during the 
configuration of  data collection elements (DCE). OEE KPIs are affected by the order-dependent DCEs. 
For KPI calculations, these DCEs are identified using their names. For example, production count is 
part of the performance KPI that is identified using its DCE name, say,  GOOD_QUANTITY , and data element. 
Order-independent data collection elements are for information purposes and are not part of OEE KPI 
calculations. 
 Both order-dependent and -independent DCEs are available as standard activities of type UI within 
the activity configuration worker UI. Hence, you can use these activities to design your OEE dashboard. In 
addition, a custom DCE can be configured in the OEE add-on, transferred to OEE, and used in the dashboard. 
 Refer to chapter   7   for automatic data collection and the configuration of custom data collection elements. 
 Tables involved:
 
 1. 
 MPM_PROD_RUN_DATA : All the data collection elements except for downtimes are 
stored here, with a quantity UOM for yield and material losses and duration 
UOM for time losses. This data may or may not be linked with a  RUN_ID in the 
 MPM_PROD_RUN_HDR table. 
 Order Downtime Tagging 
 You now know how to trigger a  downtime in OEE, and you are aware that line down affects the availability 
KPI. Line down duration for a shift directly influences the shift availability KPI. To determine the availability 
KPI at the order level, you need to allocate a downtime event to either a single order or all orders in the line. 
This is achieved using the Shared Downtime tab under Managed Downtime button in OEE dashboard. 
Please refer to the “Manage Downtime” section in this chapter to understand how this works. Once you 
allocate the downtime to one or more orders, you get the order-specific downtime, and accordingly the 
availability KPI is calculated and displayed at the order-operation level. 
 The SAP OEE database tables involved are:
 
 1. 
 MPM_PROD_EVENTS : Upon your reporting a line down, this table gets an entry 
for the line down with the assigned reason code and duration. This table has a 
unique event ID for every event created. The availability KPI at the shift level is 
calculated from this table. 
 
 2. 
 MPM_INT_EVENT_MAP : Once the order-operation is allocated a line down, this table 
gets an entry with the event ID and duration. 
 Four KPI Calculations in Real-time 
 You have seen in the previous chapters that OEE by default calculates the four key  KPIs , namely availability, 
performance, quality, and OEE. In this section, you will learn how this is calculated using an example. 
 Refer to Figure  6-38 , a view of a typical shift summary, which displays the loading time, scheduled 
downtime, unscheduled downtime and so forth happening in a shift. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
174
 OEE KPI Calculation 
 Refer to the following formulas of data elements required for KPI calculations. In chapter   3 , you learned 
that every DCE is categorized as a data element, and that a data element is either a reported element or a 
calculated element. The text in bold is reported elements, and text in italics is calculated elements. 
 Figure 6-38.  Shift summary with order details 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
175
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
176
 
 
 
■ Note  In SAP OEE, loading time is calculated as the summation of every order-operation duration and not 
the overall order-operation execution time, considering the possibility of parallel execution durations. 
 In OEE, KPI values are calculated in real-time and are not stored in OEE database tables. The reported 
elements and other order-related details are available in OEE database tables, which are replicated to HANA. 
Both OEE and HANA calculate the KPI in real-time on demand. 
 OEE database tables involved:
 
 1. 
 MPM_PROD_RUN_HDR : provides the order-operation-related details 
 
 2. 
 MPM_PROD_RUN_INT : has intervals for a run in a shift 
 
 3. 
 MPM_PROD_RUN_DATA : has the reported elements except for downtime 
 
 4. 
 MPM_PROD_RUN_EVENTS : has the downtime details 
 The KPIs monitored in OEE dashboard are shift specific. To calculate the order-specific KPIs, the same 
formulas and calculations should be used, but for each order. 
 Goods Movement in OEE 
 If you are using the 15.0 version, in this section you will learn how goods issue (GI) and goods receipt (GR) 
are performed using OEE. From 15.1 onward, these are addressed differently through the  Goods Issue and 
Goods Receipt app. Refer to chapter   8 section Goods Movement App. 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
177
 Goods Receipt 
 Whenever yield is reported, a goods receipt of the produced yield is mapped to order confirmation BAPI 
and updated to ERP using the  ORDER_CONFIRM_BAPI workflow. The ERP order confirmation extension can be 
triggered as and when data is reported or at the end of order completion.  
 To trigger a GR for yield, report yield using the report production button in the OEE dashboard worker 
UI. Ensure the ERP order confirmation is added as an extension to the “Report Data” or “Complete Order” 
methods in general configuration/extension configuration worker UI. 
 Goods Issue 
 Goods issue happens in two ways: 
 
 1. 
 Backflush of components: Automatic goods issue during order confirmation  
 
 2. 
 Manual goods issue: Report raw material consumption to ERP using OEE dashboard  
 Backflush of Components 
 For the backflush scenario, ensure the backflush field is set at either material component level. To do this go 
to MM02 ➤ MRP2 ➤ set “Always Backflush” for Backflush field. Send the components to OEE using tcode 
BD10. Refer to Figure  6-39 . 
 Figure 6-39.    Set backflush using tcode MM02       
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
178
 Create an order and execute it in OEE. Once the order is completed, as part of ERP, order confirmation 
GI is triggered for raw material consumption and updated in ERP as movement type 261.  
 Manual Goods Issue Trigger from OEE 
 For this scenario, the components material should not be set for backflush. During the order execution, raw 
materials consumption will be reported manually from the OEE dashboard.     
 By default, the “Report raw materials” option will not exist in OEE dashboard. You need to add the 
standard activity ( ACT_RAW_MAT ➤ SAP – Report Raw Material Data Collection) as a custom button using 
the dashboard configuration worker UI. Once this configuration is done, you can report raw materials 
consumption using the OEE dashboard. Refer to Figure  6-40 . The components specific to phase under 
an operation are displayed here wuth the planned quantity of comsumption. These are picked from 
MPM_RESBL table.  
 Figure 6-40.  Report raw material in OEE dashboard 
 Raw materials can be reported by entering the actual quantity consumed for each components. Also, it 
can be yield-based consumption. Select the Yield-based Consumption button as shown in Figure  6-41 and 
key in the yield quantity produced, then click calculate button. OEE automatically calculates the quantity for 
each component based on the quantity maintained in BOM. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
179
 Figure 6-41.  Report raw material: yield-based consumption 
 Raw materials consumption can be also recorded automatically from the shop floor by using OEE action 
blocks in BLS transactions. Refer to Appendix ➤ Automated data collection to understand these action 
blocks. Once the raw materials are recorded, either manually or automatically, the ERP order confirmation 
extension picks these component consumption data for goods issue. Again, the GI can be triggered as and 
when the data is reported or at the end of order completion. 
 
■ Note  As mentioned previously, from 15.1 onward, raw materials consumption recording and goods 
movement are taken care of using the Goods Issue and Goods Receipt app found in Application Launch Pad. 
It is recommended you not use the all the standard activity, dashboard option, OEE action blocks mentioned in 
the previous section (for 15.0 version), as the 15.1 version has a better way of handling it. Refer to chapter   8  to 
understand more on the Goods Issue and Goods Receipt app delivered through Application Launch Pad. 
 Update Order Confirmation and Goods Movement to SAP ERP 
 The  order-operation execution flow completes with an operation confirmation uploaded back to ERP. When 
an order-operation is completed, an outbound OEEINT workflow ( ORDER_CONFIRM_BAPI ) is triggered from 
OEE, which has the order-operation confirmation, activity confirmation, and goods movement updates 
for SAP ERP. By default, the input structure of BAPI has all three elements. You can decide to have only the 
required confirmations in this workflow by enhancing the XSLT transaction. For instance, if you do not 
want the goods movement update to happen, then you can disable that section. If you want to calculate 
the standard activities automatically, then the XSLT should be enhanced to pass these activity values.  
GOODS_MOVEMENT_BAPI is another outbound workflow that can be triggered through an OEE extension to 
report the goods movement of reported waste to SAP ERP. 
 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
180
 ORDER_CONFIRM_BAPI workflow can be triggered in the following ways:
 
 1. 
 By configuring the  ORDER_CONF_EXT extension to the “Complete order” service 
method under worker UI for management/general configuration/extension 
configuration, which triggers ERP confirmation on every order completed 
 
 2. 
 By configuring the  RUN_CONF_EXT extension to the “Close shift” service 
method under worker UI for management/general configuration/extension 
configuration, which triggers ERP confirmation on shift completion 
 
 3. 
 By configuring the  DC_CONF_EXT  extension to the “Report data” service method 
under worker UI for management/general configuration/extension configuration, 
which triggers ERP confirmation upon reporting any data collection (production, 
scrap, quality defects) in OEE dashboard under Report Production button  
 
 4. 
 On order-operation completion, the tables are updated with the order status 
 CMPL . Confirmations Enqueuer is the scheduler job, which looks for this order 
status, executes the  ORDER_CONFIRM_BAPI workflow, and enqueues them in the 
OEE message queue. This scheduler sends the confirmations to ERP, even for the 
incomplete orders, if the customization parameter “ERP periodic confirmations” 
in the general configuration/customization configuration worker UI is set to  Yes 
for each work center. 
 GOODS_MOVEMENT_BAPI workflow can be triggered in the following ways:
 
 1. 
 By following any of the above steps for  ORDER_CONFIRM_BAPI . By default,  
ORDER_CONFIRM_BAPI has the goods movement structure upload to SAP ERP.  
 
 2. 
 By configuring the  SCRAP_COMP_GM_EXT extension to the “close shift” service method 
under the worker UI for management/general configuration/extension configuration, 
which triggers the goods movement of material waste on close of the shift.  
 
 3. 
 By configuring the  SCRAP_COMP_DC_GM_EXT extension to the “Report data” service 
method under the worker UI for management/general configuration/extension 
configuration, which triggers the goods movement of material waste on reporting 
data in OEE dashboard. 
     Real-time Monitoring of Shop Floor through OEE Dashboard 
 By now, you have an understanding of OEE-specific data management, order-operation execution, data 
collection, and KPI calculations. Ultimately, the aim of SAP OEE is to monitor and visualize these reported 
and calculated data in real-time on OEE dashboard. You have also learned how to configure and customize 
OEE dashboard through the dashboard configuration worker UI. OEE dashboard with KPI monitor is 
updated at a refresh rate that is set for the UI page. 
 OEE dashboard is used to  monitor and visualize in real-time the following:
• 
 View/start/hold/complete status of order-operations 
• 
 Data collection summary, which may be OEE- or non-OEE-relevant 
• 
 Line and machine availability 
• 
 Material and time losses with their reason code and root-cause machines attached 
to them 
• 
 Four standard shift KPIs. Order KPIs can also be viewed under the line monitor 
dashboard 

CHAPTER 6 ■ SAP OEE DASHBOARD
181
 Apart from this, you can build your own custom dashboards using SAP UI5 and integrate them into the 
standard OEE dashboard. From SAP MII 15.0 SP03 onward, SAP OEE dashboard works with SAP UI5 XML 
view only. In cases with a custom dashboard, ensure the view files are developed based on the SAP UI5 XML 
view. 
 OEE dashboard can be viewed in real-time or historical. When a real-time custom UI is to be integrated 
into the standard OEE dashboard, the custom UI expects some input parameters in real-time from the 
standard dashboard. These are made available through global context. You will learn more about global 
context and how to use it in the dashboard in chapter   7 . 
 Near Real-time Replication of OEE Transaction Data to HANA 
 SAP HANA is an optional analytics component with which you can analyze OEE performance. To do this, 
HANA needs to be replicated with the OEE data in near real-time. The required OEE transaction tables are 
configured for replication with HANA tables through the SLT (SAP Landscape Transformation) server. 
 Following are the tables  replicated to HANA from ERP and OEE. 
 OEE Master  tables from ERP:
• 
 /OEE/MPH_KPITARG 
• 
 /OEE/MPH_LAYOUT 
• 
 /OEE/MPH_MRKDWN 
• 
 /OEE/MPH_NODE 
•

• 
 /OEE/MPH_NODEATO 
• 
 /OEE/MPH_NODESTR 
• 
 /OEE/MPH_NODET 
• 
 /OEE/MPH_CFN 
 Authorization  tables from ERP:
• 
 USRBF2 
•

• 
 /OEE/C_TE_TYPET 
 OEE Transaction  tables from MII:
• 
 MPM_PROD_RUN_HDR 
• 
 MPM_PROD_RUN_INT_EVT 
• 
 MPM_PROD_RUN_DATA 
• 
 MPM_DATA_AS_MC_EVT 
• 
 MPM_SCHEDULED_DOWN 
 When you use HANA as the analytics component for SAP OEE, you get the HANA Live component. 
HANA Live for SAP OEE is the real-time operational reporting solution that can be deployed on HANA and 
provides SAP-delivered content in the form of HANA views and reports. You can also develop custom views 
and reports for OEE analysis. 
 By default, HANA Live for OEE delivers the following analytics:
• 
 Loss Analysis report 
• 
 Groups all the reports related to losses, such as unscheduled down, speed loss, 
and quality loss. The report provides the drill-down view of the reason codes 
assigned, attached machine events, and so on. 
• 
 KPI Analysis report 
• 
 Provides the KPI analysis at the hierarchy level — regional and plant level. 
You can analyze the KPIs and asset utilization in different trend formats for the 
nodes that are reporting production. 
• 
 Data Collection report 
• 
 Analyze order-dependent and -independent data collection elements data 
reported in OEE 
• 
 Data Elements report 
• 
 Analyze the different data elements, like reported and calculated elements, for 
different work centers and plants 
 In HANA, the KPI analysis is done at the work-center level where the production is reported. When the 
KPI has to be analyzed at the plant level, the KPIs are aggregated from the child node (work center) to the 
parent node (plant).

 Summary 
 In this chapter, you have learned the purpose of OEE dashboards and how to configure them, as well as seen 
detailed descriptions of SAP-delivered OEE dashboards and an overview of standard OEE functionalities. 
 In the next chapter, you will learn about the data model of OEE, its purpose and detailed structure, 
various customization configurations specific to OEE, in OEE Add-on and different business use cases.

 CHAPTER 7  
 SAP OEE Customizations 
 This chapter will explain the SAP OEE data model, various configurations of custom data required in OEE, 
automatic data collection scenarios, and other use cases. 
 By now, you understand how SAP OEE helps in modeling the plant objects using the plant hierarchy, 
categorization of losses, KPI calculations, operator dashboard for data collection and order processing, and 
finally the analytics, which help you to assess your plant performance — which is the ultimate goal of OEE. 
 During the implementation of SAP OEE, though there are many standard features delivered as part 
of the product, you may need to do a few enhancements and customizations to fulfill all the business 
requirements. In this chapter, you will learn the various customizations and enhancements possible for OEE 
using a use-case scenario. You will also come to understand the detailed data model of OEE and the purpose 
of each OEE database table. 
 OEE Custom Actions 
 As part of the execution of SAP OEE installation, BLS Transaction in SAP MII workbench is provided with 
additional action blocks that are specific to OEE and help in OEE enhancements and customizations. These 
action blocks help us to achieve automatically many of the OEE functionalities that are otherwise carried out 
manually — for example, data collection. 
 For example, you report production yield using the report production activity in the dashboard. You can 
achieve the same functionality to get the production data automatically from automation to OEE using the 
SAP OEE service interface/report production action block. In this section, you will see in detail the purpose 
of and the required mapping for each of these action blocks. 
 OEE-specific custom actions can be broadly categorized based on their functionality as one of the 
following:
• 
 custom actions specific to shop floor data collection in SAP OEE  
• 
 custom actions to update data to SAP HANA from SAP OEE  
• 
 custom actions to update data to SAP ERP from SAP OEE 
 Once the SAP OEE component is deployed successfully and you see the OEE menus on the MII home 
page, you can see the jar file deployed under MII Menu ➤ System Resources ➤ Custom Actions. Refer to 
Figure  7-1 . This jar file is the library of OEE-specific APIs deployed and available in MII workbench under 
the  SAP_OEE_INTEGRATION actions menu. 
 Figure 7-1.  OEE jar file for custom actions 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
186
 To view the deployed actions, go to MII workbench, open a transaction, and view the Actions menu. 
Refer to Figure  7-2 . 
 Custom Actions for OEE Shop-Floor Data Collection 
 For every order processed in a shift, various production-related data, such as production volume and time, 
scrap, quality defects, line speed, and so forth, are collected, which helps in calculating the order and shift 
KPIs. Again, these data collection elements can be order dependent or order independent, and those are 
required for OEE and other KPI calculations. These data can be collected manually through the dashboard 
or automatically using enhancements in MII using OEE APIs.    
 There are some custom actions deployed as part of OEE component. These custom actions or APIs 
(Application programming interface) are used to report data collections to OEE, such as yield, scrap, defects, 
and downtimes, which are required to calculate OEE. It is also used to execute order-related activities, such 
as start, resume, and complete order-operation. 
 To understand the purpose of automatic data collection, let us look at an example where you have 
shop-floor applications such as DCS, SCADA, PLCs, and so on. Each of these applications provides you with 
particular process data that should be ultimately reported to SAP OEE. For example, you get the machine 
and line availability from PLCs, process data from DCS, and start/complete information of production 
orders from SCADA. This information needs to be pushed to SAP OEE in real-time in order for the operators 
to work on the operators dashboard. You can build your own custom SAP MII transactions using these APIs 
and make your data collection automatic from the shop floor. 
 Figure 7-2.  OEE custom  action blocks 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
187
 In this section, we will first examine in detail the purpose of some of the OEE action blocks present in 
BLS Transaction in SAP MII which you need to use for custom developments and its input/output mapping 
structure for every API or method. You can use these action blocks to develop BLS transactions, which you 
can use for various scenarios, some of which are explained in section Customization Scenarios in SAP OEE.
 
 1. 
 Find SAP OEE Services : This custom action helps to find the list of APIs or 
services available to report any shop floor – related information to OEE. 
 
 2. 
 Input : Not Mandatory 
 
 3. 
 Output : The output XML of the action returns all the OEE APIs specific to shop 
floor data collection service. Refer to Figure  7-3 . 
 Figure 7-3.  Response XML of Find SAP OEE Services action block 
 S AP OEE Service Interface : This custom action is the one with which you can execute all of OEE’s shop 
floor data collection service methods. You need to  configure  the credential alias with an SAP MII user who 
has OEE roles and leave the search filter empty. Then, click on the search button to view the complete list of 
shop floor data collection service APIs. Refer to Figure  7-4 . Select the required data collection methods that 
you want to use and then provide the required inputs under the Link configuration for the action block.

 In SAP OEE, the order-dependent data collection elements can be reported only if an active order exists. 
Sometimes, the operator may miss starting the order in the SAP OEE dashboard while the actual order 
production has started on the shop floor. In this scenario, if real-time integration is configured with 
shop-floor systems and SAP OEE, data collections such as yield, scrap, rework, and so on will get lost, 
as there is no active order. Real-time shop-floor buffering is the solution for this data collection loss. 
This buffering framework can be developed in SAP MII with a user interface to monitor the buffered 
data. The buffered data can then be reported to SAP OEE once the order exists in OEE; this can be 
achieved through custom extensions. Customization of OEE extensions is discussed in later sections. 
One such scenario is explained in section Customization Scenarios in SAP OEE.

 Figure 7-5.  Overview  of SAP OEE data model 
 In the preceding figure, you can see the different ERP master data, OEE-related master data, and 
OEE-related configuration and transaction data. All the data are downloaded from SAP ERP in the form of 
IDocs, and each message is processed by the SAPOEEINT framework for storage in the SAP OEE database. 
 The transaction data are replicated to SAP HANA from time to time as per the configuration set. 
 There are 143 standard tables present in SAP OEE. Please refer to Appendix Section 2: OEE Standard 
Tables to get the list of standard tables and their types, purposes, and descriptions. 
 There are two key aspects involved when monitoring the OEE KPI, events, and order executions/run. 
In this section, you will learn what happens when an event is reported to SAP OEE and how it affects the 
various tables. 
 OEE Data Model 
 OEE CTC execution deploys the standard OEE tables on the SAP NetWeaver database of SAP MII. OEE 
custom actions help in performing the shop-floor execution functionalities and the required updates to 
HANA and ERP automatically. In this section, you will review the structure of OEE data model. 
 The OEE  data model  can be broadly categorized into three types for storing the following type of data:
• 
 Master data (OEE related) 
• 
 Configuration data 
• 
 Transaction data 
 The following is the high-level overview of the data flow, or data model, of OEE. Refer to Figure  7-5 . 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS

 Data Model Flow for Events 
 A  downtime event   is an order-independent data collection element. Refer to Figure  7-6 , which describes 
how the various event tables are affected when the downtime event flows from the shop floor.  
 Figure 7-6.  Data flow for downtime event in OEE 
 When a machine or line event is reported to OEE, it is updated into the  MPM_PROD_EVENTS table with a 
unique  Event_ID . When this event is linked with a root-cause machine as the cause for the event, the 
 MPM_EVENT_NODE_MAP table gets an update where the  Event_ID and  Machine Node ID are linked. 
 When this event is linked with another event as the root cause, then the  MPM_EVENT_MAP table gets an 
update where the parent and child event IDs are linked. 
 The  MPM_DATA_EVENT_MAP table has the order specific speed loss. It has a map between the  Entry_ID 
and  RUN_ID from production run and event ID.  RUN_ID is the unique ID for order in a shift.  Entry_ID is the 
unique for every data collection.  Event_ID is the unique ID for every downtime. 
 The  MPM_INT_EVENT_MAP table maps the event with the order run interval by mapping the event ID 
with the time ID ( Time_ID is the unique ID for every order interval) from the  MPM_PROD_RUN_INT  table. This 
map happens once an event is assigned to an order-operation using the “Shared downtime” tab under the 
Manage Downtime button in OEE dashboard. 
 The  MPM_PRDRUN_INT_EVT table has the map of aggregated events and the order run intervals. 
 The  MPM_AGGR_EVENT_MAP table has the map between  AGGR_ID and  Event_ID . 
 The  MPM_DATA_AS_MC_EVT table has the reference to the machine event that is the root cause for the 
event; it gets the reference data from a node that reports production. In OEE, two machine events can be 
linked as one being the root cause for the other machines down. This event to event map is maintained in 
this table. 
 Understanding these table structures and their purposes helps during the customization or 
enhancement of an event scenario. 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
191
 Data Flow for Order Run 
 In SAP OEE, production or  process  order is one of the key elements in determining the KPI and ultimately 
the performance of the plant. Refer to Figure  7-7 , which describes how the various production tables are 
affected from when the order is downloaded to SAP OEE until it gets completed. 
 In SAP OEE, loading time is one of the key parameters in calculating the OEE KPI. Loading time is the 
duration of each order run within a shift. In this section, you will learn how production/process order data 
flows right from its download in SAP OEE to its completion and update of production information back to 
SAP ERP. 
 The following are the database tables that are relevant for the production/process order run data flow:
 MPM_RELEASED_DMD_HDR :  Upon download of an order from ERP, it is either 
auto-released or released manually from the order dispatch UI and gets an entry 
in this table with the release details and status. It also gets an entry into the 
 MPM_RELEASED_DMD table with additional details, such as OEE operation details.  
  These two tables are linked with their respective unique identifiers, such as 
 RELEASED_HDR_ID and  RELEASED_ID . 
 MPM_PROD_RUN_HDR :  This is a key table that stores the complete information of an 
order, such as status, order start, order complete timestamp, shift ID, material, 
UOM, and so on. This table gets an entry of an order only after it is started from 
the dashboard. Every order run has a unique  RUN_ID  for every shift.  RUN_ID is 
the key identifier that helps in many customizations to fetch different data from 
different tables. 
 Figure 7-7.  Data flow for data collection in OEE 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
192
 MPM_PROD_RUN_INT : In Chapter   3 , you learned about configuring production 
activities. This table captures the changeover of these production activities as an 
order run interval specific to every  RUN_ID . For the order runs configured with 
production activities, this table has 1 to  n mapping; i.e.,  MPM_PROD_RUN_HDR has 
one entry per shift, and  MPM_PROD_RUN_INT has  n  entries for the same order run. 
If there are no production activities configured, then this table has one-to-one 
mapping with the  MPM_PROD_RUN_HDR table entries; i.e., both  MPM_PROD_RUN_HDR 
and  MPM_PROD_RUN_INT have only one entry for an order run in a shift (assuming 
the order was not placed under hold).  
 MPM_PROD_RUN_DATA : This is the data collection table where all the data collection 
elements except downtimes are captured. Both production and material losses 
such as scrap and rework are captured, with the material UOM as the dimension. 
Standard value parameters such as setup time, labor time, machine time, and 
so on are also captured in this table, with duration as the data type. Every data 
element is identified using its unique data collection element name. 
 MPM_SHIFT_HANDOVER : This table has all the details about every shift handover 
process. All the necessary information about the closing shift happenings are 
updated in this table using the comments along with the closing-shift user and 
new-shift user details. 
  From the OEE transaction data perspective, the events and order run data 
flow are critical for KPI calculations. The necessary tables are configured for 
replication to SAP HANA. 
 
■ Note  KPIs are not calculated and stored in SAP OEE and SAP HANA, but they are calculated dynamically 
whenever required for display in the dashboards. 
 Customizing OEE Configuration Data 
 In this section, you will learn how to configure OEE configuration data as well as look at its purpose, or 
use case.  
 Customizing Production Activity 
 Production  activities  may be required to set up for different activities within the order run, such as after an 
order is started and before the order is completed. For example, a production or process order may pass 
through different production phases such as setup time, material consumption time, actual production time, 
cleanup time, and so on. To capture all these different production time intervals, production activities can be 
used. This will ensure the capture of each of these durations so as to determine the performance of an order. 
These time intervals can also be used to determine product costing in SAP ERP. 
 Let’s go over the steps to configure the custom production activity. 
 In SAP ERP, open T-Code OP7b - Create Formula Parameters. Refer to Figures  7-8 and  7-9  to create the 
production activities as per your requirements. In this example, two production activities, consumption and 
production, are configured as formula parameters. You need to configure the right dimensions and standard 
values for these parameters. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
193
 Go to T-Code OP19 - Create Standard Value Key and enter the created formula parameters for this key. 
Refer to Figure  7-10 . 
 Figure 7-9.  Create formula parameters: activity  2 
  Figure 7-10.  Create standard value key 
 Figure 7-8.  Create formula parameters: activity 1 
 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
194
 Go to T-Code: CR02 - Update Work Center and go to Basic Data tab. 
 In the Basic Data tab, add the newly created formula parameters in the Standard Values Overview 
section, as shown in Figure  7-11 . 
 Figure 7-11.  Update work center with standard value  keys 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
195
 Go to the Costing tab and set the Rec. type group as desired. Refer to Figure  7-12 . 
 Figure 7-12.  Update Rec. type group for the production activity 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
196
 Transfer the Production Activity, Standard Value Key, and Formula Parameters IDocs to SAP OEE using 
the OEE configuration data transfer transaction (T-Code: /oee/bo_idoc). 
 Transfer the Work Center IDoc to SAP OEE using the T-Code: POIM. 
 Open the general configuration worker UI under the MII Menu ➤ Worker UI Management and set 
the value of the customization “Relevant Production Activity” as  CONSUMPTION and  PRODUCTION . The words 
“consumption” and “production” are picked from the production activity text used while creating the 
production activity in the previous step. Refer to Figure  7-14 . 
 Figure 7-13.  Create OEE configuration data: production activity 
 Figure 7-14.    Configure  production activity in OEE         
 Go to T Code: SPRO ➤ Production ➤ Overall Equipment Effectiveness ➤ Define Production Activities 
 Add the newly created formula parameter names here in the production activity column. Ensure the 
same name is used here. Refer to Figure  7-13 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
197
 Go to the manage orders activity of the OEE operator dashboard to see that the Assign button for each 
order has these two production activities. Now you can select the desired activity once you start the order; 
this is not mandatory though. You can also select the Assign button to change from one production activity 
to another. Refer to Figure  7-15 . 
 Figure 7-15.    Configured production activities in OEE dashboard       
 
■ Note  Change Production Activity is available as an OEE service interface (Shop Floor Data Collection 
service in SAP OEE Service Interface action block in workbench; refer to Section OEE Custom Actions) but is 
not available as a standard method under the extension configuration in the dashboard. Hence, no custom 
extension can be added to the Change Production Activity functionality from the SAP OEE dashboard. 
 Customization of OEEINT Workflow Configurations 
 In Chapter   4 ,  you learned about the OEEINT workflow configurations, which primarily process the inbound 
and outbound messages to and from SAP OEE. In this section, you will see few use-case scenarios for 
customization of these workflows.
 
 1. 
 Workflow message:  LOIPRO01 
 Orders when downloaded can be auto-released or manually released as per the 
requirements. By default, auto-release is enabled for LOIPRO. To enable manual 
release, add the following line of code in the Request XSLT file at the end for 
the LOIPRO workflow. Then add the customized request XSLT filepath to the 
LOIPRO workflow under workflow configuration. 
 <automaticRelease>false</automaticRelease>  
 This customization ensures the orders are manually released using the order 
dispatch worker UI. 
 
 2. 
 Workflow message:  ORDER_CONFIRM_BAPI 
 This is an outbound order confirmation message from SAP OEE to SAP ERP. This 
message calls the standard BAPI for order confirmation (Internally OEE decides 
the right BAPI based on the order type. i.e.,  BAPI_PRODCONF_CREATE_TT BAPI for 
Production order and  BAPI_PROCCONF_CREATE_TT BAPI for Process order) and 
passes the mandatory inputs, such as yield quantity, scrap quantity, rework quantity, 
and standard value activities, such as setup time, labor time, machine time, and so 
on, as configured in the production order. The Order confirmation using standard 
extension can be triggered at different instance based on the requirement
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
198
At the end of every data collection reported (Yield, Scrap, Rework)
At the end of every order-operation completion
At the end of every shift/day/week/monthly using the confirmations scheduler 
by configuring the scheduler frequency accordingly.
There may be a requirement where the yield confirmation needs to be sent after 
the order is complete and the activity confirmation needs to be sent at the end of 
shift. In this scenario, the Request XSLT transaction can be customized to pass 
the required data and remove the data that are not be passed. 
 Customization Scenarios of OEE Extensions 
 In Chapter   5 , you learned about extension configuration under the general configuration worker UI. In this 
section, you will learn the possible scenarios for custom extensions.    
 Extension configuration lists the standard SAP OEE methods that are intended for specific dashboard 
functionality, such as start order, complete order, report data, report downtime, and so on. Sometimes, the 
functionality achieved by these standard methods may not be sufficient and has to be customized as per the 
plant requirements. In such a scenario, custom transactions are developed, configured as a custom activity, 
and then hooked to extension configuration. 
 The following are some of the use-case scenarios for custom extensions for standard OEE methods:
 
 1. 
 Start order-operation
• 
  When the operator misses starting an order and to avoid the loss of order-
dependent data collections, these data collections can be buffered at the SAP 
MII layer. A custom transaction needs to be developed that can be hooked to the 
“Start Order-Operation” method under extension configuration in POST mode. 
On order start, this custom transaction will be executed from the OEE dashboard 
to pick the buffered data collections and assign them to the right order and then 
report it to SAP OEE. 
• 
  Upon the start of an order-operation in SAP OEE dashboard, a custom extension 
can be executed to transfer this information to the shop-floor SCADA system for 
data synchronization in real-time. 
 
 2. 
 Report data
• 
  After reporting quality waste from the SAP OEE dashboard, a custom extension 
transaction can be executed to trigger a quality maintenance notification to ERP. 
 
 3. 
 Order complete
• 
  Upon selection of “order complete” in OEE dashboard, a custom extension 
transaction can be executed as a PRE option that will calculate all the standard 
activities like setup time, machine time, labor time, and report it to OEE. In 
this way, the standard values are calculated automatically at the end of order 
completion and a manual entry is avoided. These reported standard activities 
are included as part of the standard extension “order confirmation” and 
reported to SAP ERP. 
 
 4. 
 Create downtime
• 
  After reporting a machine’s downtime, a custom extension transaction can be 
executed to trigger a plant maintenance notification to SAP ERP.      

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
199
 
 5. 
 Close shift
• 
 If there is any unaccounted for yield/scrap/waste that could not be reported 
to SAP OEE due to the absence of an order, after the close of the shift, these 
data collections can be reconciled automatically using a custom extension 
transaction. 
 
■ Note  Custom extensions can be used only when the standard methods are used in the OEE dashboard. 
For example, a custom extension hooked to the “Order Complete” method will be executed only when order 
completion is done from OEE dashboard and not from the custom OEE actions performed by BLS Transaction in 
the background. 
 Access Global Context from Standard SAP OEE Dashboard 
 In Chapter   6 , you learned about the standard OEE dashboard and how it utilizes a set of parameters for its 
functionality, such as shift details, active order, selected dashboard, work center, and so forth.  
 When you want to configure a custom OEE dashboard and consume it within the standard dashboard, 
you need the many parameters for achieving custom dashboard functionality, such as the current shift, 
plant, client, order under execution, and so on, dynamically. All these parameters with their current 
values are made available as global context. In this section, you will learn how to access the global context 
parameters and use these in your custom OEE dashboard. 
 Prerequisites 
 Develop a SAP UI5 – based application using XML view. Add a custom activity of type UI under the activity 
configuration worker UI. Add the custom activity to a button of a standard OEE dashboard using the 
dashboard configuration worker UI. 
 Global context comes with nine main contexts that are further classified into sub-contexts. The main 
contexts are the high-level data such as KPI, node, and so on, and the sub-contexts are a drill-down of main 
context information, such as the different KPI values in the case of KPI context and current work center node 
ID and capacity ID for the node context. 
 Please refer to Appendix Section 6: Global Context to view the list of main contexts and their 
sub-contexts. 
 To retrieve the main contexts, add the following piece of JavaScript code to the beginning of your 
custom UI activity code developed using SAPUI5: 
 this.appComponent = this.getView().getViewData().appComponent; 
 this.appData = this.appComponent.getAppGlobalData(); 
 To get the value of the context elements, say, node ID, plant order number, and so on, use the 
following code: 
 Var NodeID = this.appData.node.nodeID; 
 (Here node is the main context and nodeID is the sub context) 
 Var plant = this.appData.plant; 
 Var ordernumber = this.appData.selected.order.orderNo; 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
200
 SAP MII–Based OEE Analytics 
 As SAP HANA is an optional analytics component, and in the event that SAP HANA component is not 
available, SAP MII can be leveraged to build the OEE analytics on smaller set of data; e.g., for single plant. 
 SAP MII’s data and visualization services can be leveraged to build the OEE analytics. The custom 
dashboard can be developed and viewed as an SAP MII portal dashboard or can be merged within the 
standard OEE dashboard — the standard OEE dashboard and custom OEE dashboard can be merged and 
viewed in single window with easy navigation for the benefit of the users. Refer to Scenario 4 in Section 
Customization Scenarios in SAP OEE for the configuration steps and a design example. 
 The following lists contains some common OEE analytics that can be developed on SAP MII:
• 
 Planned versus actuals report on order execution  
• 
 OEE loss report on material losses and time losses 
• 
 Shift summary report with a drill-down to data collection, downtime, and KPI report 
• 
 Shift and order KPI dashboard 
• 
 Cross-plant KPI and loss comparison report 
 
■ Caution   Proper sizing of the SAP MII (NetWeaver) database should be done for good system performance. 
MII-based OEE analytics should be aimed for short-term analysis only. Data from SAP OEE should be archived 
into an external database to store long-term data, which can be SAP BI, if the analysis needs to be done for 
long-term data in SAP MII. 
 Customization Scenarios in SAP OEE 
 In this section, you will review various customization scenarios right from shop-floor data collections and 
how to view or use the customizations in SAP OEE dashboard. 
 Scenario 1: Manufacturing Automation Systems’ Integration with SAP 
PCo and SAP MII 
 A common scenario while implementing SAP OEE is needing the integration of SAP MII with 
manufacturing automation systems through SAP PCo so as to collect the shop-floor data automatically and 
report it to SAP OEE.  
 Refer to Figure  7-16 , which represents the overall architecture of how the SAP PCo is connected 
with SAP MII and SAP OEE for automatic shop-floor data collection. SAP PCo is used to connect to the 
manufacturing automation systems through OPC or other supported adaptors in order to get the data for the 
machine status or process parameters either by notification (on-change) or by ad-hoc query from SAP MII. 
SAP MII then updates the data in SAP OEE by executing the corresponding SAP OEE service. 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
201
 Prerequisites 
 SAP PCo is set   up with the necessary agents and notifications to trigger the data collection, such as machine 
event, yield, waste, and so on. 
 The following is the sample XML structure of a machine event notification configured under the Output 
tab in SAP PCo Notification. Every data collection should be configured with an SAP PCo notification. Refer 
to Figure  7-17 . 
 Figure 7-16.  Architecture for  shop-floor data collection 
 Figure 7-17.  PCo Notification  configuration 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
202
 Every data collection event is reported at either the line or the machine level, which is referenced using 
a node ID in SAP OEE. The mapping between shop-floor messages and the hierarchy node ID is essential at 
the SAP MII level. For example, when reporting a machine’s downtime, it is reported specific to the machine’s 
node ID in OEE. A yield for a specific work center should be reported to its work center node ID in OEE.
 
 1. 
 Create a  BLS transaction  in SAP MII workbench to receive the data from SAP 
PCo and report to SAP OEE. In this example, we will see how to report machine 
downtime. Add an XML parameter in the BLS transaction input property to 
receive the SAP PCo notification XML. Refer to Figure  7-18 . 
 Figure 7-19.  Tag versus OEE node ID mapping 
 Figure 7-18.  SAP MII custom transaction: shop-floor data collection 
 
 2. 
 Get the node ID of the machine or line whose downtime is being reported. You 
should create a custom mapping between the node ID of each SAP OEE object 
with its respective tag or alias if defined in SAP PCo. Refer to Figure  7-19 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
203
 This custom tag  versus  OEE object mapping helps in maintaining the map, which 
can be queried dynamically, and avoids hard coding at the SAP PCo level.  
  Figure 7-20.  MII transaction  to report machine event to OEE 
 
 3. 
 Configure the preceding BLS transaction as a trigger transaction by specifying 
it in the destination for each PCo notification of type Machine Event. Refer to 
Figure  7-20 . The notification XML passed from SAP PCo has the tag name, tag 
value, and timestamp. 
 
 4. 
 Get the OEE object node ID from the custom mapping by passing the tag name 
from the notification XML. This node ID may be for a machine or a line.  
 
 5. 
 Get the tag value from the PCo notification XML to check whether the event is for 
the machine’s being up or down. If the event is for machine down, then execute 
the SAP OEE service interface  ReportUnscheduledDowntime  and pass the inputs 
as shown next. Refer to Figure  7-21 . 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
204
 
 6. 
 You can use the standard data collection element  Unscheduled_Down , which is 
configured as part of standard SAP OEE, or you can configure your own 
custom data collection element name specific for machine down and line down. 
This data collection element is the unique identifier for OEE to understand the 
type of data collection collected from the shop floor. 
 
 7. 
 Pass the retrieved node ID to the Node ID input. If your shop floor can report 
reason codes automatically, you can pass it through the parameters rc1 to rc10 in 
the service interface. 
 
 8. 
 The same transaction is executed when PCo notification is triggered for a 
machine or line up event. When the tag value is for machine up, call OEE service 
interface:  ReportUnscheduledUptime . For this action block, only the node ID is 
required, as the OEE system checks the open machine or line down for the same 
node ID and closes that event. Even if a close event comes first, probably because 
the open event did not reach OEE, then SAP OEE throws an error, as it could not 
find an open downtime. 
 Scenario 2: Shop-Floor Data Buffering in SAP MII 
 Order-dependent data collections such as yield, scrap, rework, and so forth may be collected automatically, 
which was explained in the previous scenario. For these data, being order dependent, you need to pass order 
and operation number to the OEE service interfaces in addition to what was explained in the earlier section. 
Please refer to Appendix Section 1: Automated Data Collection to understand the mandatory inputs to be 
passed for OEE service interface methods. 
 Refer to Figure  7-22 , which is the typical technical data flow for automatic reporting of order-dependent 
data collection elements. Similar to the machine event, the PCo notification is triggered on tag-value change, 
and a custom BLS in SAP MII is executed. A custom SAP MII transaction gets the line node ID from the custom 
mapping using the tag name (in this case for yield value). The logic checks for the presence of an active order 
for the selected line node ID. If an active order exists, the OEE service interface to report production is executed 
and the yield is reported to OEE. Order–operation, line node ID, data collection element ( GOOD_QUANTITY) , 
material, and the yield quantity are passed to the input parameters of this action block. Similar to a machine 
status event, data collection element names should be maintained for order-dependent data collection 
elements as well.  
 Figure 7-21.  OEE  service interface:  ReportUnscheduledDowntime 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
205
 If there is no active order, the data collection details collected are buffered in a custom database table 
with details such as tagname, line node ID, timestamp, and yield quantity. An active order may not exist in 
a scenario where the order is started on the shop floor but is not started in OEE. The processing status of 
these shop-floor buffered messages can be monitored using a custom data collection monitor user interface. 
Initially the status of the messages will be “Buffered,” which should be changed to “Processed” once reported 
in SAP OEE. These buffered messages that are not reported to SAP OEE due to the absence of an active order 
can be processed using a custom extension from the order-operation start event in SAP OEE dashboard. 
 A custom activity referring to an SAP MII BLS Transaction needs to be added as a post extension to the 
“Start Order-Operation” method in the general configuration/extension configuration worker UI. Please 
refer to Chapter   5 , “Reason Code Configuration,” for details of the configuration. This logic is executed 
whenever an order operation is started in OEE dashboard. The logic checks the order start timestamp and 
picks all the buffered messages that are older than this timestamp and reports them to SAP OEE using the 
OEE interface for reporting production. The operator should ensure that the order start timestamp is started 
in the past, as this was originally missed, so as to start it at the right time. Refer to Scenario 3 for more details. 
 The custom data collection monitor (refer to Figure  7-23 ) can be developed and integrated with the 
standard OEE dashboard and is where the processing status of each message can be monitored. You can also 
configure the same monitor to reconcile messages that are no longer required or don’t belong to that shift. 
 Figure 7-22.  Data flow for shop-floor data buffering 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
206
 
■ Note  Data buffering is not required for order-independent data collection elements, as they do not need an 
active order in OEE while getting reported. 
 Scenario 3: Custom Extensions in SAP OEE Dashboard 
 Custom extensions in SAP  OEE  are used as an extension to OEE’s standard functionality when the standard 
functionality cannot achieve the complete requirement or there is a need to execute custom logic for specific 
events in the dashboard. In Scenario 2, the shop-floor messages are buffered at SAP MII as there is no active 
order. When the order is started, these messages should be picked up and reported to OEE. This is achieved 
by developing a custom extension and configuring it to the “Start Order-Operation” method under the 
extension configuration in the SAP OEE dashboard. 
 Develop BLS Transaction for Custom Extension 
 
 1. 
 Develop a custom BLS transaction in SAP MII workbench to handle the 
processing of these buffered messages, using the following transaction 
properties: 
• 
 XMLInputString DataType: XML Type: Input This XML contains the details the 
started order-operation 
• 
 XMLOutputString DataType: XML Type: Output This XML contains the output 
structure of the “Start Order-Operation” method 
• 
 XMLModifiedOutputString DataType: XML Type: Output. This is the modified 
version of XMLOutputString when you want to consume the modified output in 
OEE Dashboard. Refer to Custom KPI section later in this chapter. 
 
 2. 
 Get all the order-related details from the  XMLInputString property to handle the 
logic inside the transaction. 
 Figure 7-23.    Custom OEE dashboard       
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS
207
 
 3. 
 Refer to Appendix Section 5: Extension Configuration to understand the XML 
structure of each extension method. In this scenario, for the “Start Order-
Operation” method, the  XMLOutputString XML gets all the order-related 
information, such as  Run_ID , order-operation number, start timestamp, order 
number, material, plant, shift ID, and so on, from the start order extension. With 
this order number and shift ID, the buffered shop-floor messages that are in 
status “Buffered” are picked up and compared with the order start timestamp. If 
the data collection timestamp is greater than the time of order start, then these 
messages can be picked up and processed for reporting production by executing 
the corresponding SAP OEE service interface. You can also implement your own 
custom validation logic for reporting buffered production counts. Ultimately, the 
operator is responsible for accounting yield to the respective order if the yields 
are not accounted automatically.

 Scenario 5: Calculate and Monitor Custom KPI 
 SAP OEE delivers four standard KPIs, such as availability, performance, quality, and OEE. But apart from 
this, there could be industry-specific KPIs that need to be monitored in a plant. SAP OEE has the placeholder 
to create, calculate, and monitor customized KPI, which will be covered in this section. 
 Typically custom KPIs can be the following:
• 
 Planned versus Actuals on
 a. 
 operation costs 
 b. 
 order completion as per the promise dates 
 c. 
 lead time of different product variants 
• 
 Measure the work center capacity 
• 
 Measure the line set speed to compare with line’s nominal speed, and so on 
 Line speed is an important data to collect from shop floor. Every production line or work center has a 
speed-determining machine where the line speed is set by the operator, and it is normally the rated or the 
nominal speed of the material being produced in the line. This speed is directly proportional to the rate of 
production. Production is high when the set speed is more than the nominal speed and vice versa. Over-
speed causes the wear and tear of the machines as they are made to work more than their rated speed. 
Under-speed leads to less production. Hence, it is essential to monitor this speed as a KPI in OEE to achieve 
the planned production goals. 
 Prerequisites 
 
 1. 
 Define a custom KPI in OEE add-on in SAP ERP and transfer it to SAP MII. 
(Refer to Chapter   3 for the steps to create a custom KPI, which is similar to a 
standard KPI creation). Refer to Figure  7-30 . 
 Figure 7-30.  Create custom KPI in OEE add-on 
 
 2. 
  Add the custom KPI to the line node under plant hierarchy where you want to 
monitor this KPI and also maintain data for the KPI targets, as without targets the 
KPI data will not be displayed in the OEE dahsboard screen. i.e., in KPI andon of 
OEE standard dashboard, the KPI actual values are displayed with a color coding 
set based on the target value range. If the target value are not maintained, display 
of actual values with color coding will not appear in the dashboard. Refer to 
Figure  7-31 . 
 

CHAPTER 7 ■ SAP OEE CUSTOMIZATIONS

 4. 
 Custom logic: 
 a. 
  Refer to Scenario 1 which explains you the required steps to collect a shop 
floor data collection element using PCo notification. In this case, it is a line 
speed. 
 Once you get the line speed using a PCo notification, determine the 
corresponding Line Node ID against which this line speed is collected. 
Refer to scenario 1 where it talks about the custom mapping to determine 
this line node ID. 
 Using the Line Node ID, get the nominal speed for line and material 
combination which is configured in plant hierarchy (fetch it from standard 
table  MPM_MPH_NODESTR ). 
 Compare this nominal speed against the collected line speed. 
 
 5. 
 Use this formula to calculate the Speed KPI: 
 Speed KPI in % = (Collected set speed/nominal speed) x 100 
 
 6. 
 In the preceding XML, fields marked in red are placeholders for the custom KPIs, 
and these values must be dynamically filled from your custom logic. The number 
of custom KPIs and their positions are dependent on the KPI targets. Normally 
SAP OEE allows you to configure and display six KPI targets in the dashboard.  
 
 7. 
 The result XML is copied to  XMLModifiedOutputString . 
 
 8. 
 Save the MII transaction. 
 
 9. 
 Create two custom activities — one for custom extension and another for 
displaying the custom KPI in OEE dashboard. Please refer to the steps mentioned 
in earlier scenarios to create a custom activity for adding this transaction (created 
in step 1) as a custom extension. Refer to Figure  7-32 . 
 Figure 7-32.    Configure custom activity of transaction type       
 
 10. 
 Under Extension configuration, now configure a custom extension using the 
custom activity created to GetOEEKPI method. The extension type should be 
post while adding the extension. GetOEEKPI method provides with all the values 
of four standard KPIs and the inputs required for calculating these KPIs. These 
values can be used to calculate our custom KPI wherever applicable. For example 
the GetOEEKPI will provide you the Line Node ID, real time values of downtime 
and other order related data. Refer to Appendix for understanding the structure 
of this XML. Refer to Figure  7-33 .

      Scenario 6: QM Notification Handling 
 This section will describe how SAP OEE can be enhanced to trigger  quality notifications in ERP. 
 Quality defect is one of the data collection elements collected in SAP OEE that affects the quality KPI. 
Similar to a machine breakdown notification, you can also develop a customization to trigger a quality 
notification from SAP OEE to SAP ERP that reports a quality defect. The shift- or order-specific quality 
notifications can be displayed as a report in OEE dashboard for the operators view.
 
 1. 
 Develop a custom OEE dashboard with an option to create quality notifications 
and to display the created quality notifications. 
 
 2. 
 Create a custom activity of type UI with the XML view file under the activity 
configuration worker UI (refer to Figure  7-36 ). Follow the steps in Scenario 4 to 
create a UI activity.

 Refer to Figure  7-40 the Monitor QM custom dashboard screen where you can create and manage the 
quality notifications. You can customize as per the plant requirements. In this section, it also shows how the 
custom dashboard is merged into the standard OEE dashboard. Here the Quality notifications are created 
manually using the custom dashboard or it can be triggered automatically by configuring the custom BLS as 
an extension to the “Report Data” method (whenever defect is reported) under extension configuration or 
can be based on your plant requirements.

 Dispatching production orders 
from SAP ERP to work center/ 
work center capacities. The work 
center may work as a single-line 
multiple capacity or multiple-line 
and multiple capacities. 
 Orders are created and dispatched 
to the right work center. Work 
center can be modeled as a single 
line with multiple capacities 
or multiple lines with multiple 
capacities using LOIPRO workflow 
enhancement and customization 
configuration. 
 Refer to Chapter   3 to set up the 
plant hierarchy with different 
work centers. 
 Refer to Appendix Section 3: Line 
Behavior to check the different 
options for line configuration. 
 Refer to Chapter   5 , section on 
“Reason Code Configuration,” 
to learn how the orders can be 
dispatched or released. 
 Example: 
 Typically in a plant, different materials, or material with different variants, are getting produced in different 
work centers. Each work center has a different set of operations, machines, and so on. Plant hierarchy 
enables you to define different types of work center models, materials to be processed, and so on, that 
will be used in SAP OEE. Orders are created in ERP, and when pushed to OEE, they get dispatched to their 
proper work centers based on the hierarchy configurations.

 All the order-dependent and 
-independent data collections 
can be collected manually or 
automatically in OEE operator 
dashboard. The collected data are 
confirmed automatically to ERP 
using standard workflows. 
 Refer to Chapter   6 ; report 
production to understand the data 
collections using OEE dashboard. 
 Example: 
 Production and material loss data reported in SAP OEE needs to be confirmed to SAP ERP in real-time. You 
may have different instances that do the order confirmation.  ORDER_CONFIRM_BAPI is the standard workflow 
that does the order-operation-level confirmation in ERP. This confirmation can be done after each data 
reporting or at the end of order completion using OEE standard extensions. 
 Goods movement: goods issue 
and goods receipt 
 Goods movement of raw materials 
and finished goods can be 
achieved using the Application 
Launch Pad (available from SAP 
OEE 15.1). 
 Refer to Chapter   6 , “Line 
Availability Summary,” for goods 
movement functionality. 
 Example: 
 Goods movement of finished goods is to be updated in ERP in real-time as and when it is produced. 
 Role-specific operator dashboards 
for plant/line monitoring and 
order handling 
 SAP OEE delivers three standard 
dashboards for operators’ action 
and to monitor plant and line’s 
performance 
 Refer to Chapter   6 to check 
the standard OEE-delivered 
dashboards. 
 Refer to Chapter   5 , “User 
Administration in SAP OEE,” 
to configure role-specific OEE 
dashboards. 
 Example: 
 Each user has specific tasks or responsibilities and accordingly they may have to get the right permissions 
in the SAP OEE dashboard. A supervisor does an order dispatch based on the line/capacity availability, 
which an operator is not allowed to do. An operator collects all data from the shop floor, whereas a 
supervisor should have the permission to edit these collected shop-floor data. SAP OEE enables you to 
define this role-specific OEE dashboard using a simple configuration map.

 Example: 
 Any execution system lying in the middle of enterprise and shop-floor systems has the prime responsibility 
of integrating the two layers in real-time for proper data synchronization and plant visibility. SAP OEE 
ensures this bidirectional data flow with SAPOEEINT framework. Workflows are delivered by default, 
which ensures this SAP ERP to plant floor integration.

be leveraged to develop the 
automated data collection 
scenarios. 
 Refer to Chapter   7 ’s Scenario 1 to 
check the customization required 
for automated data collection. 
 Example: 
 Yield, machine down, line down, scrap, and quality defects are standard data collection elements required 
for four standard KPI calculations. There may be some non-OEE-specific data collection elements to be 
collected, like actual line set speed, material-specific custom losses, and so on. 
 Flexibility in defining the shop-
floor area using plant hierarchy 
in OEE while accommodating the 
process business rules 
 SAP OEE add-on component 
in SAP ERP is a configuration 
framework to model your plant 
correctly, from plant as the root 
node to equipment as the last 
child node. Plant, area, team, 
line, machine, and equipment 
are the nodes that can also be 
custom ones, as per the specific 
requirements. 
 Refer to Chapter   3 , “Plant 
Hierarchy,” to check how to 
configure different plant objects 
as nodes and use them in OEE 
for KPI monitoring and data 
collection. 
 Refer to Chapter   5 section 
Extension Configuration to 
understand how extensions can 
be added to implement business 
and process rules to work centers 
and lines. 
 Example: 
 Plant hierarchy can be defined with multiple work centers, with each work center having different 
machine, bottleneck, and material combinations as per the plant requirements. For each configured line, a 
set of process rules can be developed and configured using OEE extensions. One line may be configured for 
automated data collection and another for manual data collection. A line may have to update the standard 
activities automatically to ERP on order completion and another line may not.

 Use Case 
 OEE Functionality 
 Chapter Reference 
 Effectively determine speed loss 
from the machine responsible for 
a loss in production speed 
 SAP OEE automatically calculates 
the speed loss at the end of line 
production. SAP OEE is also 
flexible enough to determine the 
speed loss at the source machine, 
for example, a bottleneck 
machine, with few enhancements. 
 Refer to Chapter   3 section Plant 
Hierarchy Configuration / 
Bottlenecks tab to learn how 
to define bottleneck machines 
in a plant hierarchy, and refer 
to Chapter   7 ’s “Customization 
Scenarios in SAP OEE” section. 
 Example: 
 SAP OEE determines the speed loss for the end-of-line production counter. If there is a bottleneck machine 
in a line, and if this is the root cause for the end-of-line speed loss, you can always determine the speed loss 
when it happens at the bottleneck machine instead of waiting until the production is reported at the end of 
line. This can be achieved using a customization. 
 Define virtual lines, lines sharing 
same machine, and so on the way 
you want, and accordingly OEE 
understands the model 
 Virtual lines and lines with shared 
machines can be easily configured 
using the OEE master data — plant 
hierarchy 
 Refer to Chapter   3 section Plant 
Hierarchy condigurations / 
Details tab to learn how to define 
different work center models. 
 Example: 
 A packing machine may have to be shared between two lines. For example, the products coming out of line 
1 and line 2 have to be packed by this machine with its respective order reference. The two lines ideally 
merge to this sharing machine. This scenario can also be modeled in OEE by creating virtual lines; i.e., two 
different lines are created in the plant hierarchy, and this machine will be part of both the lines. 
 Execute different bottleneck 
scenarios influencing the line’s 
availability, such as single and 
parallel bottleneck scenarios 
 Bottleneck machines can be 
defined in the plant hierarchy 
and used in OEE dashboard. 
Different bottleneck scenarios can 
be defined to determine the line’s 
availability using customization 
configuration “Line Behavior.” 
 Refer to Appendix Section 3: Line 
Behavior to check on different 
bottleneck scenarios SAP OEE 
supports. 
 Example: 
 Based on the line’s complexity, there may be one or more bottleneck machines whose availability is 
directly linked with the line’s availability. In SAP OEE, you can configure two bottleneck scenarios. 1) The 
line is down when the single or any one of the (multiple) bottleneck machines are down. 2) The line is 
down only when all the bottleneck machines are down. SAP OEE marks the line down automatically based 
on this configuration set. 
 Synchronize shop-floor data with 
OEE data to avoid manual errors 
 OEE custom actions enable you 
to develop simple automatic 
data-collection scenarios, which 
ensures real-time data updates 
to OEE from the shop floor and 
avoids any manual errors or data 
manipulations. 
 Refer to Appendix Section 1 to 
check how SAP OEE custom 
actions can be used to collect data 
automatically from the shop floor.

 OEE Functionality 
 Chapter Reference 
 Example: 
 Though data collection and many order-related activities such as order start/hold/complete can be 
done manually in an OEE dashboard, it is prone to manual errors, data manipulation, and so forth. In 
this scenario, all the line operations can be fully automated or partially automated. For example, data 
collection can be automated and the order start/complete information can be synchronized with the shop 
floor by triggering this information in real-time using OEE custom actions and extensions.

 Use case for  KPI monitoring 
 Use Case 
 OEE Functionality 
 Chapter Reference 
 Calculate and monitor four 
standard KPIs: availability, 
performance, quality, and OEE 
 SAP OEE delivers calculation 
and monitoring of four KPIs as a 
standard feature. 
 Refer to Chapter   6 ’s “Four KPI 
Calculations in Real-Time” section 
to understand the four standard 
KPI calculations. 
 Example: 
 Availability, performance, quality, and OEE are the four KPIs that are critical to measure and monitor so as 
to analyze the plant performance and to take corrective action. 
 Flexibility of OEE in defining 
the different data elements 
influencing the KPI calculations. 
For example, industry- and 
plant-specific losses will have to 
be defined under a specific loss 
category, and the OEE KPI is 
calculated automatically without 
any customization. 
 The SAP OEE add-on 
configuration framework enables 
you to define custom data 
elements and data collection 
elements, which can be further 
categorized under a specific loss 
category. For example, you can 
define a plant-specific material 
loss (deviation of finished product 
weight from the standard weight) 
as a custom data collection 
and configure it under the data 
element DEFECT. Thus, this 
material loss automatically 
gets factored into quality KPI 
calculations. 
 Refer to Chapter   3 ’s “OEE 
Configuration Data in ERP” 
section to understand SAP OEE 
configuration data for loss and 
production data categorization. 
 Example: 
 As a standard, SAP OEE accommodates yield, scrap, defects, and line downs as the data collection 
elements with which to calculate the four standard KPIs. But as per the plant requirements, you can 
configure the plant-specific material and time losses under the specific data elements (production and 
loss), and this will be automatically considered when calculating the standard KPIs. 
 Develop, calculate, and monitor 
industry-specific custom KPIs 
using the OEE placeholders for 
enhancement 
 OEE extensions allow you to 
develop custom logic to calculate 
custom KPI calculations that 
can be hooked as an extension

 OEE Functionality 
 Chapter Reference 
 Example: 
 Each industry may have its process-specific KPIs or additional KPIs to be monitored, such as speed 
variation (variation between actual set speed and the nominal speed of the line), variation of finished good 
weight from its standard, and so on. All of these can be customized and monitored. 
 Use SAP OEE beyond OEE KPI 
monitoring by collecting non-
OEE-specific data collection 
elements 
 SAP OEE collects both OEE-KPI-
specific and non-OEE-specific 
data collection elements. 
 Refer to Chapter   7 ’s 
“Customization Scenarios in SAP 
OEE” section to understand how 
non-OEE-specific data collection 
elements can be collected from 
the shop floor. 
 Example: 
 Line set speed, finished goods weight, labor time, setup time, machine time, and so forth are non-OEE-
specific data collection elements that can be configured and collected from the shop floor. SAP OEE is used 
beyond OEE-specific elements.

 CHAPTER 8  
 Additional features of SAP OEE 
Management 
 This chapter will explain the features that were updated in OEE 15.1 as part of the SAP MII 15.1 release, 
which include the following:
• 
 Creating PM notification from worker UI 
• 
 Line-specific alerts and UI activity to create alerts from OEE dashboard 
• 
 Data collection at machine level 
• 
 Manual correction of order execution 
• 
 Addition of visual icons on dashboard buttons and customer logos in dashboard  
• 
 Data maintenance through CSV/XML upload 
• 
 Quick setup of a demo SAP OEE plant without having an ERP connection 
• 
 Download and reuse the standard UI code for custom development 
• 
 Application Launch Pad to launch application goods movement apps (Goods Issue 
and Goods Receipt) and other custom apps 
• 
 SAP Lumira plug-in to create plant-based report on local MII data (covered in chapter   9  )  
 Creating PM Notification from Worker UI 
 In Chapter   6 , you learned how to create a machine downtime using the OEE dashboard worker UI. In some 
scenarios, operators need to create a PM notification as a follow-up process to machine downtime. This 
makes addressing the machine or line downtime complete. 
 From MII 15.1 onward, in the Manage Downtime/Machine Downtime tab (refer ahead to Figure  8-3 ), 
you can see a new option: “Report Notification.” Report Notification enables the operator to create or trigger 
a breakdown or maintenance notification from SAP OEE to the PM module of SAP ERP. 
 Notification can be created for a work center or machine irrespective of the machine’s availability; for 
instance, a notification can be triggered even if the machine is not down, as when preventive maintenance is 
required. Notification creation triggered by the operator can be controlled by a configuration parameter under 
the general configuration/customization configuration worker UI, as explained next. The PM notification 
feature ensures real-time integration of SAP OEE with the plant maintenance module in SAP ERP.  

CHAPTER 8 ■ ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF SAP OEE MANAGEMENT
228
 Prerequisites 
 Customization Configurations 
 
 1. 
 Go to SAP MII Menu ➤ Worker UI Management ➤ General Configuration ➤ 
Customization Configuration. 
 
 2. 
 Select the customization “PM Notification Type” for plant hierarchy nodes where 
you want to enable the triggering of notification creation; for example, at the 
machine and line nodes. 
 
 3. 
 Enter the notification types that should available in OEE from the notification 
types maintained in ERP. 
 
■ Note  The notification types that are added under customization configuration should be available in SAP 
ERP, else the notification creation will be incomplete. 
 
 4. 
 Configure the customization “Allow Automatic PM Notification Trigger.” If this 
value is set to  NO , then the system triggers the PM notification to SAP ERP only 
on an approval (say, by a supervisor) from OEE dashboard. If set to  Yes , the 
notification is triggered automatically without an approval process.      
 Activity Configurations 
 
 1. 
 Go to SAP MII Menu ➤ Worker UI Management ➤  Activity Configuration 
 
 2. 
 ACT_PM_NOTIF_LIST : This is a new activity added for PM notification functionality. 
The standard OEE dashboard does not have this activity configured by default. You 
need to configure this activity in your custom dashboard to manage PM notifications. 
When creating a PM notification, the current shift is considered, and if there is no 
shift found, the system picks six hours prior to current time as the notification time, 
or you can overwrite by defining the duration in this activity under Option. i.e., When 
duration is defined as 4 hours, then the notification time is considered 4 hours past 
from the current time when no shift is found. Refer to Figure  8-1 .  
 Figure 8-1.  Activity configuration: Duration option: display PM notifications 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF SAP OEE MANAGEMENT
229
 
 3. 
 You can choose to create the PM notification when you are reporting downtime. 
To get these notification details in the Report Downtime dialog, you need to add 
the option  ALLOW_PM_NOTIF to the  ACT_DOWN_LIST  activity. Refer to Figure  8-2 . 
 Report Notification in Manage Downtime 
 Refer to Figure  8-3 , where you can see the “Report Notification” option in the Machine Downtimes tab of the 
OEE dashboard worker UI once step 3 is configured.  
 Figure 8-3.  Manage downtime: report notification 
 Figure 8-2.  Activity configuration: PM notification option 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF SAP OEE MANAGEMENT
230
 Once the notification is created, all the notifications are listed in the OEE operator dashboard under 
Notification details. This UI lists the notification created and waiting for supervisor’s approval or rejection. 
The need for approval is controlled by a customization parameter “ALLOW PM NOTIFICATION TRIGGER”. 
When this activity set to ‘Yes’, the notifications are triggered without a need for an approval. When set to ‘No’, 
the notifications are triggered only after supervisors approval from this page. Even the supervisor can reject 
the notification trigger, pending approval, approve them, or delete or reject them. Also, this UI ensures the 
tracking of all the notification requests created, rejected, and approved. Refer to Figure  8-4 . 
 The prerequisite for creating the notification request is to maintain a list of technical objects and 
corresponding equipment as well as the functional location of machines within the Technical Objects tab of 
the plant hierarchy. (Refer to chapter   3 , “Plant Hierarchy Template Configuration”).  
 Create PM Notification 
 
 1. 
 Within the Machine Downtimes tab, select an existing machine down row and 
select “Report Notification,” or directly select this option if you wish to trigger 
notification for a machine that requires maintenance. Notifications can be 
created even for machines that are not down.    
 
 2. 
 Refer to Figure  8-5 , where a new dialog is opened in which you can enter the 
details, such as functional location, equipment, notification type, breakdown/
maintenance start time, and end time (if planned). Check the “Breakdown” 
checkbox if the notification is of the breakdown type, and finally enter the 
comments and click the OK button. Now the notification request is created.   
 Figure 8-4.  OEE dashboard: Notification details 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF SAP OEE MANAGEMENT
231
 
 3. 
 The created notification request is listed in the notification details worker UI. 
Refer to Figure  8-6 . The status of the notification request is “Pending Approval.”  
 The supervisors who have the role-based access to this UI can view and select the notification request 
and can decide to approve, reject, or delete it.
 Any one of the following roles are required for approving the PM notifications: 
 OEE_SUPERADMIN 
 OEE_SUPERVISOR 
 OEE_INTEGRATOR

CHAPTER 8 ■ ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF SAP OEE MANAGEMENT
232
 The alerts can be also be created from OEE dashboard. For this configure a custom button in OEE 
dashboard with the activity  ACT_OEE_ALERT . Open the custom button which navigates to a screen and from 
this screen the user can select a work unit and can raise an alert directly. Refer to Figure  8-7a . 
 Line-Specific Alerts 
 Alerts on the shop floor are a critical and a mandatory element required so that the operator can act 
proactively. In OEE, SAP MII’s alert framework can be leveraged to configure different alerts. In OEE, 
everything works at plant hierarchy node level. Hence these alerts also should be line and operator specific 
so that the right operator is alerted at the right time. Line specific alerts is a new feature part of OEE 15.1. 
 The alerts are displayed on the top-right corner of the OEE dashboard worker UI. These alerts are role 
and line specific (Only operators assigned to roles defined for alerts can view the alerts), and selection of the 
alerts will provide their details. The alert can be viewed, acknowledged, or set to “In progress” from the OEE 
dashboard. Alerts with high priority are displayed automatically in a dialog box. Refer to Figure  8-7 .  
 Figure 8-7.  Line-specific alerts 

CHAPTER 8 ■ ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF SAP OEE MANAGEMENT
233
 Figure 8-7a.  Line-specific alerts using a dashboard button 
 Data Collection at Machine Level 
 In previous chapters, you have seen that KPIs are calculated at the node where the production is reported 
(Report production is enabled in plant hierarchy for this node), and ideally the node is for a line or work 
center. All the order-dependent and -independent data collection elements, such as yield, waste, defects, 
speed loss, and any other custom data collection, were reported at the line level except for downtime, which 
can be created at both machine and line levels. In SAP OEE 15.1, this feature is enhanced and extended to 
data collection at the machine level as well. Similar to line-level reporting, data collections at the machine 
level can be handled manually through the operator dashboard or automatically through customizations. 
 There are three activities that govern this functionality as explained here:
• 
 ACT_RPT_PRD_MAC : This, when configured, allows you to indicate that a reported 
machine’s data affects the line KPI. 
• 
 ACT_GENERIC_MAC : This activity allows you to collect machine-specific data. 
• 
 ACT_ORD_IND_MAC : This activity allows you to collect data at the machine level that 
are order independent. 
 
■ Note  Reporting at the machine level is totally independent to reporting at the line level and does not affect 
the line KPI, unless the “Impacts Line” checkbox is selected when reporting. 
 Refer to Figure  8-8 , where you can see that the line and its respective machines, which are used for 
order execution, are listed, and on selection of the line or machine, you can report the different data 
collections. 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF SAP OEE MANAGEMENT
234
 This feature enables the operator to capture the exact version of information from the shop floor at 
each machine level; these data are otherwise missed when reported at the line level, as the line level data 
is a consolidation of different data collection elements. Data collection at machine level is a use case when 
Line Behavior customization parameter is set to multi line multi capacity in General configuration. In 
this scenario, orders are started at individual capacity level and hence data collections are expected to be 
collected at machine level. 
 Manual Correction of Order Execution Data 
 In previous chapters, you have seen that the start time or the end time of an order can be edited to expand 
or shrink the order duration. At times, there can be a situation where the order under execution may have to 
be reverted to its original status of  NEW from  ACT or to be canceled altogether. It could be that the order was 
started by mistake, or that due to a decision the order execution is not required.     
 The Manage Orders screen of the OEE dashboard worker UI enables you to edit the start and end times 
of the already started order. From SAP OEE 15.1 version onward, this screen enables the operator to change 
the order status to  NEW from  ACT or to cancel the order. To do this, select the Details button for that order and 
then select the Set to New button. Refer to Figure  8-10 . 
 To set the status to NEW, ensure that the reported order-dependent data such as production, scrap, and 
so on are deleted manually. Please note that the data can be deleted only if they are not confirmed to ERP 
as an extension of  Report Data  method. To abort an order, the order should be set to Hold first and the data 
collections are to be deleted. You can manually delete the reported data collections in the Report Production 
screen of the OEE dashboard for the selected order. Refer to Figure  8-9 .

  Visual Icons and Customer Logo in the Dashboard 
 Multiple visual icons are added in this new version that can be used in the dashboard configuration worker 
UI while configuring dashboard buttons.  
 Refer to Figure  8-11 for a sample OEE dashboard, where you can see the dashboard buttons are 
configured with visual icons. 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF SAP OEE MANAGEMENT
236
 The customer’s logo can be added in the OEE dashboard worker UI in place of the SAP logo. This is 
made possible by adding an additional configuration parameter “logo” in the dashboard configuration 
worker UI.  
 You need to maintain the image file in the web folder of the MII catalog in workbench and pass the 
entire URL of the image file to the logo field in the dashboard configuration worker UI. Refer to Figure  8-12 .

 Refer to Figure  8-13 , where the configured customer logo is displayed in place of the SAP logo.   
 Data Maintenance through CSV/XML Upload 
 Data Maintenance of Reason Codes through CSV Upload 
 In chapter 5, you learnt that specific set of reason codes structure can be assigned for each data collection 
element under General configuration / Reason code configuration. This basically ease the process of reason 
code assignment for the operators. Until SAP OEE 15.0, once the reason codes were transferred from SAP 
ERP to OEE, assignment of reason codes specific to a plant hierarchy node and a data collection element had 
to be entered manually under the general configuration/reason code configuration worker UI.  
 Figure 8-12.  Dashboard configuration: configure logo 
 Figure 8-13.  OEE dashboard: display customer logo 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF SAP OEE MANAGEMENT
238
 From SAP OEE 15.1 onward, reason codes can be entered in a template and uploaded to OEE using a 
worker UI; this will automatically assign the reason codes to plant hierarchy nodes. This assignment can be 
viewed under the general configuration/reason code configuration worker UI for each hierarchy node. 
 To do this, go to SAP MII Menu ➤ Worker UI Management ➤ Data Upload. Download the standard 
template named “Multiple Reason Code to Node Assignment” and maintain the data as per the standard 
template. Then save the file as a CSV in your local system. Refer to Figure  8-14 . 
 Figure 8-14.  Data upload: download templates 
 Upload of Reason Code to OEE 
 To upload the reason codes to OEE, go to SAP MII Menu ➤ Worker UI Management ➤ Data Upload. Select 
the template “Reason Code Assignment to Machines” and browse the location of the file, then click the 
Upload button. Once the data is uploaded, the assignments can be viewed in the general configuration/
reason code configuration worker UI. 
 There is a custom action SAPOEE Reason Code Machine Upload which is actually used internally 
when the template is uploaded in Data Upload screen. But many a times, the standard template may not 
be sufficient in which case you can transform the standard template into a custom template as per your 
requirements and then upload the data into the standard table. 
 Data Maintenance of Downtimes through CSV Upload 
 In earlier versions, the assignment of a reason code to a downtime was always a manual process for 
downtimes collected both manually and automatically. From SAP OEE 15.1 version onward, you can use 
a standard template to update all the planned and unplanned downtimes for a machine and work center 
along with the reason codes and then upload it to OEE. This is highly useful for the maintenance supervisor 
who plans for the scheduled downtimes. They can easily update the template with all the downtimes and 
upload it at one shot, avoiding the effort of creating the scheduled downtimes and assigning the reason 
codes individually. 
 You can download the standard template from SAP MII Menu ➤ Worker UI Management ➤ Data Upload. 
 In the downtime template, you can maintain machine or line downtimes and any custom data 
collection element of type time duration and save it to your local system. 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF SAP OEE MANAGEMENT
239
 Upload of Downtimes in OEE 
 To upload the downtimes in OEE, go to SAP MII Menu ➤ Worker UI Management ➤ Data Upload. Select 
the template “Downtimes” and browse the location of the file, then click the Upload button. Once the data 
is uploaded, the system updates the details in the respective tables. The downtimes can be viewed in the 
Manage Downtimes screen of the OEE dashboard worker UI. Once the downtime is updated to OEE tables, 
the respective line downtimes are automatically factored into KPI calculations. 
 Upload of Reason Code in OEE Add-on 
 Until SAP OEE 15.0, reason code upload in SAP OEE add-on in SAP ERP allowed you to upload the plant 
reason codes in CSV/XML format. At a later time, additional rows can be merged or the complete table can 
be overwritten. 
 From 15.1 onward, global and plant reason codes can be uploaded separately, and you can also merge 
or overwrite these reason codes separately. Refer to Figure  8-15 . 
 Figure 8-15.  Reason code upload in OEE add-on 
 Also, there is the addition of a column for sequence number. Refer to Figure  8-16 . This sequence 
number determines the way the reason codes will be sorted and listed in the reason code hierarchy for the 
operator to select. You need to determine and define this sequence number based on the way you want the 
operator to look at the reason codes, which will increase the operator’s efficiency in reason-code selection.

 Quick Setup of a Demo SAP OEE Plant without 
Having an ERP Connection 
 In SAP OEE 15.1, you can set up a demo OEE plant without integrating with the SAP ERP system for setting 
up master and configuration data. The demo plant helps you to understand and demonstrate  the   OEE 
functionalities without the need for the complete setup of all the other systems. 
 There are two CTCs to be executed for this purpose:
• 
 SAP OEE Demo Plant Master Data Setup CTC  
• 
 SAP OEE Demo Plant Order Data Setup CTC 
 SAP OEE Demo Plant Master Data Setup CTC 
 This CTC sets up the ERP-related master data required to run the OEE system. To execute the CTC, go to 
Netweaver ➤ Configuration ➤ Scenarios ➤ Configuration Wizard. 
 Search for OEE CTCs and select “SAP OEE Demo Plant Master Data Setup CTC.” Click the Start button. 
Refer to Figures  8-17  to  8-19 .

 After this CTC is executed, go to SAP MII main menu ➤ ERP-Shop Floor Integration ➤ Queue Monitor, 
where you can see that all the master data, OEE-specific master data, and configuration data are queued for 
processing. Once all these messages are processed successfully, you can see the demo plant hierarchy under 
the general configuration worker UI. Refer to Figure  8-20 . 
 In General configuration, for the plant node, set the line behavior to “Mark Line Down When Any 
Bottleneck Is Down.” Assign the standard operator dashboard to user group “Everyone” under the general 
configuration/usergroup dashboard assignment worker UI. With this, all the users will be able to access the 
dashboard specific to demo hierarchy.

SAP OEE Integrator password and run the CTC. Refer to Figures  8-21 and  8-22 . 
 Figure 8-22.  SAP OEE demo plant order-data setup completion 
 Once this CTC is executed, you can see a list of orders queued up in Queue Monitor. Once all the orders 
are processed, the sample OEE dashboard is available for running the system with the demo data setup. On 
the Manage Orders screen, you can see the list of orders created as part of the Order Data CTC that can be 
started and whose data can be reported. 
 The reported data are maintained in the OEE standard tables.    
 Download and Reuse the Standard UI Code for 
Customization 
 Many times, developers feel that it is good to have an option to reuse the standard UI code for the UI 
activities provided with SAP OEE. The standard code, which is developed on SAP UI5, may have to be 
enhanced with custom functionalities. From SAP MII 15.1 onward, the code for standard UI activities can be 
downloaded from the activity configuration worker UI. 
 To download the UI code, go to SAP MII Menu ➤ Worker UI Management ➤ Activity Configuration. 
Select a standard UI activity from the list and click the Download Activity button. Refer to Figure  8-23 . 
 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF SAP OEE MANAGEMENT
243
 Figure 8-23.  Download standard activity 
 This will download the  controller.js and  view.xml  files of the UI code in a new page. The controller 
has the business logic implemented in the activity, and the XML view file has the XML structure of the view, 
which controls how the activity is rendered in the dashboard. This functionality ensures high reusability of 
standard functionality with less development effort. 
 Application Launch Pad for Goods Movement 
 Until MII 15.0, SAP OEE handled goods movement as follows:
• 
 Raw material consumption can be collected manually from dashboard or 
automatically through service interfaces. (From 15.1 onward, these interfaces are 
obsolete.) 
• 
 Goods movement (goods receipt of finished goods and goods issue of raw materials) 
happens along with order confirmation using the  ORDER_CONFIRM_BAPI workflow. 
 From 15.1 onward, goods movement is handled using the Goods Issue and Goods Receipt app available 
via the Application Launch Pad. 
 Operators can use this app to do the following:
• 
 Get the raw material batch (for bulk consumption) /handling unit (SSCC) details 
during Goods issue process 
• 
 Post goods issue of raw material consumed  
• 
 Reverse raw materials used in the production process 
• 
 Generate batch for finished goods during Goods Receipt process 
• 
 Post goods receipt against a production or process order available in MII OEE  
• 
 Reverse the posted goods receipt and repost it 
 On the shop floor, an operator mostly has to move around for recording via barcode scanning 
(if available) the raw materials consumed during the production process. The Goods Movement Application 
in SAP OEE is device agnostic and can be accessed from any mobile device, so the raw material consumption 
and goods receipt recording can be done on the move. 
 This app is available under the worker UI management menu in the SAP MII Menu after the SAP OEE 
configuration CTC has run. 
 

CHAPTER 8 ■ ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF SAP OEE MANAGEMENT
244
 The app supports the consumption of both HU (Handling Unit) managed and bulk materials 
consumption. These apps are built in such a way that the UI interface contains backend configurations 
where a transaction can be configured as per customer requirements. This gives flexibility to customers 
to use the Goods Issue and Goods Receipt application UI, but also have the backend transactions be 
configurable. 
 Configurations Required to Use the Goods Movement App 
Customization Configuration 
 At The plant node level, set the customization “SAP OEE Application Transaction Mode” to online or offline 
in the general configuration/customization configuration worker UI. The Goods Movement App can be 
integrated with ECC or EWM system. For EWM system, SAP will deliver standard transactions for integration 
in future release of MII. For ECC integration, custom transactions have to be developed. By default, the value 
is set to online. When set to online, the system understands that connection is good between OEE and ERP/
EWM system. When set to offline, the system understands the presence of a custom transaction and uses the 
same to post the goods movement. For custom interfaces, custom logic needs to be developed by SAP MII 
BLS transactions as per the plant requirements. The mode helps to pick up the relevant transactions from the 
activities. This customization also provides the option to configure the transaction when the mode is changed.    
 By default, OEE delivers the standard UI and interfaces for goods movement. You can choose to use the 
standard UI and add custom interfaces as per the plant requirements.  
 Activity Configuration 
 You need to configure the following activities in order to configure the apps on the launch pad: 
 
 1. 
 Choose “Create Activity.” 
 
 2. 
 Enter the relevant activity ID ( ACT_STD_COMP_GI for Goods Issue and 
 ACT_STD_COMP_GR for Goods Receipt). 
 
 3. 
 Select UI Component as the Activity Type. 
 
 4.

GI tile is launched to scan the order number. 
 Dashboard Configuration 
 The default dashboard  SAP_APP_LP_POD is delivered as a standard dashboard for the purpose of Application 
Launch Pad. Using this as a placeholder, you can copy and configure your own custom launch pad under 
the dashboard configuration worker UI. This dashboard is the placeholder to which to add the standard 
apps — Goods Receipt and Goods Issue — and also to add custom apps. The apps appear as tiles in the launch 
pad, and it also shows which activities of type “UI Component” should be configured. From OEE 15.1, 
“UI Component” is the new activity type added. This is specific for Application launch pad type dashboards. 
Ensure the custom app is defined as UI component type activity under the activity configuration worker UI 
before configuring in dashboard configuration.

 CHAPTER 9  
 SAP OEE: Reporting and Analytics  
 This chapter will explain the different options SAP OEE provides for reporting and analytics. It will cover 
the options for both local single-plant-based analytics and global consolidated analytics for the entire 
corporation. 
 The whole purpose of SAP OEE as a solution is to support the production operator so as to have 
one single user interface (the SAP OEE worker UI) for all of his or her computer-related work during the 
production shift, and also to be the continuous improvement tool for plant performance management team 
by providing meaningful insights into the data collected from the shop floor. 
 As we have already learned, to operate on the OEE worker UI, one needs master data, which is retrieved 
by MII OEE from the SAP ERP system. On the worker UI, the operator reports production-related data 
(e.g., yield, scrap, rework, and so on) and loss-related data (e.g., downtimes and speed losses), either 
manually or by automatic means via shop-floor automation. When a loss is reported the system allows 
the operator to also assign related reasons for the loss. The operators on the production line are the most 
knowledgeable in identifying the reason for any losses (unless the machines can do that automatically). 
Hence, the reason codes that are assigned for any losses during a shift are the most accurate way of 
capturing the root causes at their source. Once these losses and their reasons are captured by the worker UI, 
OEE reports are used in systematically reviewing the losses to discover any hidden areas for improvement. 
 The SAP OEE capabilities that provide insight into production performance can be categorized in three 
ways. Figure  9-1 shows the different reporting and analytics options available with SAP OEE.

 Real-Time Dashboards: Worker UI (Dashboard) and 
Plant Monitor 
 When the production worker signs on to the SAP OEE worker UI, by default he is taken to the dashboard of 
the last work center he was working on. The dashboard shows some real-time KPIs and information to the 
production operator. SAP OEE delivers a standard set of real-time information on the worker UI dashboard, 
as follows: 
• 
 The active order information (what is being produced and how much is in the 
current production) 
• 
 The open downtimes (if the production line or any of the machines in the line are 
down) 
• 
 The top untagged events (the top losses that still do not have any reason code 
assigned to them) 
• 
 The OEE KPIs (availability, performance, and quality) as percentages for the current 
shift (combining all the orders that were executed in the current shift)  
• 
 The line performance strip showing line status for last four hours 
• 
 Top five downtimes in the shift 
 Figure  9-2 shows the real-time information on the worker UI dashboard. 
 Figure 9-1.  Reporting and analytics options with SAP OEE 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ SAP OEE: REPORTING AND ANALYTICS
257
 The SAP OEE also provides a plant monitor (plant manager’s dashboard) where all the lines of the 
plant are shown with their current statuses. On clicking a line, it shows further detailed information on the 
specific line. 
 Figure  9-3 shows the real-time information of all production lines on the plant manager’s dashboard. 
 Figure 9-2.  Worker UI standard  dashboard 
 Figure 9-3.  Plant manager’s standard dashboard (plant monitor) 
 The real-time dashboard and the plant manager’s dashboard are the two options delivered as the 
standard. But you are not limited to these two dashboards. Customers can create their own real-time 
dashboards through custom development within the SAP OEE framework and plug them in as custom 
dashboards. 
 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ SAP OEE: REPORTING AND ANALYTICS
258
 Local Plant-Level Reporting 
 With the MII 15.0 release, SAP OEE did not have any standard offering of reporting based on the MII data 
it collects from the shop floor. The standard offering of reporting for MII 15.0 OEE was on HANA, which 
was expected to replicate transactional data from several MII servers and then analyze the shop-floor 
performance data for any or all plants onto the consolidated HANA server. The consolidated reporting on 
the HANA system will be covered in a later section. 
 With the MII 15.1 release, SAP OEE offers reporting and analytics capabilities on the local plant-level 
MII system, which is limited only to the configured plant on that MII instance. The central, consolidated, 
HANA-based analytics still remains as the reporting tool at the corporate level. 
 To run analytics on the local MII system, SAP OEE offers the consumption of MII OEE data by SAP 
Lumira by exposing the data to SAP Lumira through CSVs. SAP Lumira is a self-service data-visualization 
tool for business users. By connecting SAP Lumira with the standard delivered CSVs from MII OEE, business 
users can compose and visualize their own reports in SAP Lumira. 
 The following steps need to be done to set up SAP Lumira to connect to SAP OEE data in MII:
• 
 Download Lumira plug-in from MII 
 Figure  9-4  shows the MII Workbench location at which to download the Lumira plug-in and metadata 
files. It is present in both the LumiraMetadata and LumiraPlugin folders in the SAPMPM project in the web 
catalog. 
 Figure 9-4.  Lumira plug-in download 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ SAP OEE: REPORTING AND ANALYTICS
259
 Figure 9-5.  SAP OEE Lumira extension installed 
• 
 Install the plug-in on SAP Lumira 1.25 or higher. 
 Install SAP Lumira desktop and, in the SAP Lumira menu, File ➤ Extensions, Select “Manual 
Installation” and choose the path for the downloaded Lumira plug-in. 
 Figure  9-5  shows the installation of OEE plug-in in Lumira.

 Figure 9-6.  Add new dataset for OEE report configuration 
• 
 Configure Lumira with the OEE data acquisition extension and set the paths to the 
CSV dataset and the corresponding metadata.    
 From the Lumira menu, File ➤ New, select the OEE data acquisition extension and configure the path 
for the metadata and the CSV files. This needs to be done for all the CSV and metadata files. 
 Figure  9-6  shows adding a new dataset in SAP Lumira and selecting the newly installed extension.

CHAPTER 9 ■ SAP OEE: REPORTING AND ANALYTICS
262
• 
 Start analyzing data in Lumira by creating own story boards through self-service by 
consuming the configured dataset. 
 Figure  9-8 shows an example of SAP Lumira report which is created through self service by an user, after 
the plug-in is installed and configured as just explained.  
 Figure 9-8.  Lumira report with plant-level data from MII 
 The end user has to consume the dataset from these CSV files by creating storyboards in Lumira 
through self-service, as per business needs. The preceding figure shows a sample report (story board) 
created in Lumira, where the right side of the graph has all the filter criteria and also has navigation links to 
other reports at the bottom. 
 For more details about SAP Lumira, please check the   http://saplumira.com/ . 
 A FTP location and a scheduler needs to be configured so that Lumira is periodically updated with the 
latest data from MII. The following steps need to be performed to set up the periodic update of the files:
• 
 Set up a folder in the network for the CSV files and configure the folder as an FTP 
location; provide “read” and “write” permission to the “anonymous” user, so that the 
scheduler can write the file into the location. 
• 
 Configure the scheduler  OEEAutoCsvDownloadForReports , which gets added to the 
list after the OEE Integration CTC is run. 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ SAP OEE: REPORTING AND ANALYTICS
263
• 
 By default, the standard sets the scheduler to run once every 24 hours, but this can 
be modified as required. Once the scheduler runs, the CSVs will be updated with 
new records. Currently, the scheduler picks up data for last 90 days. 
 Figure  9-9  shows the configuration of the scheduler and the FTP location for the CSV files.   
 Global Consolidated Reporting at the Corporate Level with 
SAP HANA 
 As you learned in chapter   2 , SAP OEE provides standard content on HANA, where the transactional data 
from all the plant-level MII servers is replicated. The standard HANA content of SAP OEE provides the 
capability to have reporting and analytics consolidated at a global level. It comes with a set of standard 
delivered HANA calculation views and a UI5 application to view the reports. The standard delivered 
UI5 application provides a limited set of reports to be viewed for any node across the corporation (e.g., 
corporation, region, country, plant, production line, and machines). But the HANA calculation views can 
also be consumed through various visualization tools like SAP Lumira, Analysis Office, Design Studio, and so 
on to deep-dive into the consolidated data exposed through the HANA calculation views. It is also possible 
to extend both the HANA calculation views and the UI5 application through custom development.    
 The  advantages of  such global reporting on HANA are the following:
• 
 All factory data relevant for performance management is available in one single 
system for the whole corporation or organization. 
• 
 It provides the opportunity to run comparisons across plants and production lines, 
and thus offers support in making business decisions. 
• 
 Once data moves to central HANA, the comparatively older data on the local MII 
servers can be archived as required, but HANA still supports running the reports and 
analytics for the historical data. 
 Figure 9-9.  Scheduler OEEAutoCsvDownloadForReports 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ SAP OEE: REPORTING AND ANALYTICS
264
 The SAP OEE HANA global reporting system landscape is shown in Figure  9-10 . 
 Figure 9-10.    SAP OEE HANA system landscape       
 To set up and configure the SAP OEE HANA content, the following steps need to be followed after the 
ERP configurations, ERP master data, OEEINT, OEE configurations, and worker UI are set up:
 
 1. 
 The components  OEE_ERP 15.0 SP01 (or higher) and  OEE_MII 15.1 (or higher) 
should be installed, configured, and maintained for ERP master data, OEEINT, 
the OEE configurations, and the worker UI. 
 
 2. 
 Set up the  SLT replication  of tables from ERP and MII systems. The name of 
the tables to be replicated can be found in SAP Note 1803129. The tables get 
replicated to a corresponding schema in the HANA system. The replication 
server (SLT) is positioned for real-time (trigger-based) data replication from SAP 
and non-SAP sources (SAP-supported databases only). 
 
 3. 
 Two  delivery units (DUs)  HCO_HBA_OEE 1.0 SP06 (or higher) and  HCO_HBA_
APPS_OEE 1.0 SP06 (or higher) should be deployed on a HANA Live system. 
 HCO_HBA_OEE consists of OEE Reuse and Query Calculation views, which are 
built on replicated tables from the ERP and MII side. These views are mapped to 
the replicated tables in the HANA system using schema mapping. These Query 
Calculation views are exposed to the OEE HANA UI5 application ( HCO_HBA_
APPS_OEE ) where a limited number of reports are delivered by SAP OEE HANA 
for the entire corporation hierarchy. These Query Calculation views can also be 
consumed by visualization tools like SAP Lumira for deep-dive analytics. 
 
 4. 
 Set up access rights to users; once the SLT replications, schema mapping, and 
OEE components are deployed, the following authorizations need to be set up in 
order for the users to start working on the calculation views.
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ SAP OEE: REPORTING AND ANALYTICS
265
 a. 
  Read access to schemas where OEE-ERP tables, MII tables, and common 
master data tables of ECC (e.g., material, shift) are getting replicated. This will 
enable the views to consume the data from the tables.  
 b. 
 Read, write, and activate access to  sap.hba.oee and  sap.hba.apps.oee 
packages. 
 c. 
 Assign the roles  sap.hba.apps.oee.db::BusinessUser and  sap.hba.apps.
oee.db::Admin user. Also provide read and write access to  SAP_HBA schema 
(after the deployment of  HCO_HBA_APPS_OEE , the schema  SAP_HBA gets 
created). This will allow the creation of variants on the UI5 HANA reports.  
 d. 
 There are additional options to assign analytical privileges. These privileges 
provide finer control of the data coming from the same view but consumed 
selectively by different users as per privileges, which means you can provide 
access to the data of all plants to the users at the corporate office level, but 
limit the plant users to accessing data only for their own plant. 
 With the preceding steps set up correctly, the SAP OEE HANA global analytics can now be used for 
end-user consumption. We will now briefly look into the role of the HANA calculation views (Reuse and 
Query views). 
 The standard OEE  HANA  content delivers a set of calculation views. The calculation views consist 
of multiple Reuse views and Query views. The Reuse views are a basic set of views that get further used 
or consumed by the Query views. These views are created in the HANA studio through modeling. Reuse 
views are the heart of the data model. They expose the business data in a well-structured, consistent, 
comprehensible way that covers all relevant business data. They are designed for reuse by other views and 
must not be consumed directly by analytical tools. 
 To extend the OEE HANA content for specific business needs (e.g., to create a new set of KPIs that are 
not covered by the standard content) customers can also create their own calculation views. But views 
delivered by SAP must not be modified by customers. Instead, customers must create views in their own 
packages (not in the “sap” namespace). The customer-specific views may (and should) refer to Reuse views 
of the SAP OEE data model. They must not refer to Query views delivered by SAP. 
 Query views  can also be consumed directly by data visualization tools such as SAP Lumira, and reports 
can be developed with various filter options. SAP Lumira gives users the flexibility to choose from various 
available visualizations and analyze data on multiple dimensions. Figure  9-11  shows the modeling snapshot 
of a calculation view in HANA studio. 

CHAPTER 9 ■ SAP OEE: REPORTING AND ANALYTICS
266
 Now we will look into the UI5 application, which provides the list of SAP OEE UI5 reports that are 
delivered as part of the OEE standard content. With all the user authorizations in place, when a user logs in 
to the browser to access the HANA reports, the reporting screen looks like Figure  9-12 . 
 Figure 9-11.  Calculation view model  in HANA studio 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ SAP OEE: REPORTING AND ANALYTICS
267
 Figure 9-12.  SAP OEE  HANA  report application on UI5 
 The following points describe the different sections and features of the application: 
• 
 The right side shows the corporation hierarchy where you can drill down from the 
corporation at the highest level to a machine at the lowest level. This comes from the 
global hierarchy and plant hierarchy defined in SAP ERP. The corporation hierarchy 
on the right can be expanded and collapsed to increase the viewing pane. 
• 
 The top left row shows the standard report categories; e.g., Loss Analysis Report, KPI 
Analysis Report. 
• 
 Under the standard report categories, you will see the report sub-categories; e.g., 
under Loss Analysis Report you will see unscheduled down, speed loss, and quality 
loss reports. 
• 
 Under the main report area, below the main chart, lie the filter criteria that can be 
applied to the report. There are several filtering options for each report. You can 
filter unscheduled downtime losses by date range, shift, reason code level, and so 
on. All the reports will have a date range option that should be selected to see a 
limited amount of data. Otherwise, the reports will show all the data available. The 
date range, once selected, can be saved as a variant, allowing you to easily use the 
same date range again. The date range option is either an absolute range or a relative 
range. For example, Last One Month is a relative date range. The reason code level 
filter helps you to set the reason code level you want to view from. Figure  9-13 shows 
you the reason code filter settings. 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ SAP OEE: REPORTING AND ANALYTICS
268
• 
 The report can also be viewed in time trend mode by changing the analysis type via 
the options at the top left of the chart area. 
• 
 The chart shows the values of the node that is selected in the hierarchy on the 
right side.  
• 
 More dimension can be added to the chart via the “Show Dimension Selection” 
option in the right top section of the chart area. With this option, you can view the 
losses not only for a time range but also by the production shifts. The dimensions are 
added on the x-axis. 
• 
 A user can apply filters and save the individual filters for later use as variants. One of 
the filters is marked as the default. 
• 
 On the extreme left bar there are various options such as viewing the reports in 
graphical or tabular form, converting the chart into printer-friendly mode, and so 
on. Figure  9-14 shows the graph in printer-friendly mode. The left bar also provides 
an option to plug the link of the custom developed package into the application. 
There is an SAP note (1834144) that details how to add custom reports to the SAP UI5 
HANA OEE reports. 
 Figure 9-13.  Reason code filter settings 
 

CHAPTER 9 ■ SAP OEE: REPORTING AND ANALYTICS
269
 Now that you understand the different types of reporting options available for SAP OEE and the HANA 
Live component for OEE, let’s look into the list of main reports delivered on HANA. 
 Loss Analysis Report: This  report  consists of Scheduled Down, Unscheduled Down, Speed Loss, and 
Rework/Scrap reports. Except for Scheduled Down (which is usually planned), the other three are the basic 
losses captured by the OEE worker UI (dashboard) and assigned reason codes by the operator on the shop 
floor during execution. Scheduled downtimes are usually maintained by a super user (or by an operator as 
well) and assigned with a reason code. The Loss Analysis Report shows the loss reason codes in a sorted 
manner so as to quickly identify the highest contributing reasons for the losses (Figure  9-15 ). You can also 
drill down across the reason code tree to perform a root-cause analysis and find out the most fundamental 
root cause of the losses. It is also possible to view the losses in time trend mode for a particular reason code

between two production lines or between two plants from the corporation hierarchy. 
 Figure  9-15  shows the Loss Analysis Report (Unscheduled Down) with highest to lowest contributing 
reasons. It also shows the corporation hierarchy panel collapsed so as to increase the view area of the graph. 
By double-clicking one of the reason codes, you will be taken to the next level of detail for that particular 
reason code in order to view more detailed reasons for the particular loss.

 KPI Analysis Report:  This consists of reports of standard KPIs like OEE Analysis, Asset Utilization, 
and Classic Time Element analysis. The OEE Analysis shows the trend of the OEE KPI and also the trend 
of availability, performance, and quality KPIs separately. You can also compare these KPIs between two 
production lines or between two plants from the corporation hierarchy. The Classic Time Element is an 
important report that shows what, out of the total loading time, is the value operation time remaining, and 
how the loading time is eaten away by the different losses. Figure  9-18 shows a snapshot of the Classic Time 
Element Report. Figure  9-19 shows the OEE KPI report for a node.

 DATA Collection Report:  OEE Worker UI allows the operator to collect all relevant production data 
as it is configured in the OEE ERP add-on configuration. For example, let’s say it is configured to collect the 
overfill per order, additional labor per order, and also the water consumption per shift. When these data are 
collected during execution, they are also replicated to HANA. The Data Collection Report shows the trend of 
these data collections. This is a representation of the raw data collected in a time trend. Figure  9-20 provides 
a snapshot of a sample data collection of Additional Labour.

 Once the connection is made, in the same way we used Lumira with MII data for local reports, end 
users can compose their own reports with SAP Lumira for OEE from the HANA views. The options are 
endless here, depending on how you want to visualize the data compared to the fixed set of UI5 reports we 
discussed earlier. 
 Summary 
 In this chapter you have learned about the different options SAP OEE provides for reporting and analytics. 
You have learned that the worker UI (dashboard) provides real-time information about the current shift and 
orders running as well as about corresponding real-time KPIs. For plant-level local reporting, you have seen 
that SAP OEE delivers a plug-in for SAP Lumira that can be used to connect SAP Lumira with a set of three 
CSVs, which synchronize the data periodically by downloading from MII. Finally, you have learned that for 
global consolidated reporting at the corporate level, SAP OEE provides HANA content that delivers a set of 
calculation views and a UI5 application with a limited set of reports. These calculation views can also be 
consumed in a visualization tool like SAP Lumira for a self-service deep-dive and analytics. Last, but not 
the least, you have learned that all these categories can always be extended as per customer needs through 
custom development. 
 As you know, the SAP OEE HANA application provides a limited set of reports. But the SAP OEE HANA 
calculation views can also be accessed through a data visualization tool like SAP Lumira to do self-service 
reporting and analytics on the HANA views. From Lumira you can connect to HANA by selecting any one of 
the options (connect to SAP HANA or Download from SAP HANA). Figure  9-21 shows these options on SAP 
Lumira from menu item File ➤ New.

when that time is reached, the shift 
handover button will appear. 
 Enter a time duration with a desired UOM. 
 All the time-specific UOMs are listed that 
 are maintained in MPM_UOM standard table. 
 If you want to retain data for a particular 
 period, then run transaction SAPMPM/apps/
DataArchive/ 
 ArchiveNonHANAReplicatedTables 
 e.g., 10 MIN 
 Allow Modification 
of Automation 
Records 
 This parameter allows you to 
configure whether the data 
collection elements reported 
automatically from shop floor can 
be modified or not. 
 Yes: Automation records are allowed to be 
modified 
 No: Automation records cannot be modified 
 Minor Stoppages 
Should be Included 
in Availability 
 You can define here if you want 
the minor stoppages to be part of 
availability KPI. 
 Yes: System considers minor stoppages to 
 affect the availability KPI. 
 No: System does not consider minor 
 stoppages when calculating the availability KPI. 
 Irrelevant for OEE 
Calculations 
 If you have a requirement where you 
are not measuring KPI at line level, 
then you can control that using this 
parameter. 
 Yes: System considers line-specific reported 
 data collection elements for OEE calculations 
 No: System does not consider line-specific 
reported data collection elements for OEE 
calculations

■ APPENDIX 
 Customization 
Parameter 
 Description 
 Values 
 Enable Periodic 
Confirmations 
 You can use this parameter if you 
want to periodically perform order 
confirmations to ERP at a line level. 
 Yes: OEE periodically confirms production data 
to SAP ERP 
 Note: “ConfirmationsEnqueuer” is 
the scheduler job that does periodic 
confirmations for all the lines. 
 No: System follows the duration of 
periodic confirmation set at scheduler job 
“ConfirmationsEnqueuer” at the plant level 
 Shrinking Order 
Duration Allowed 
 You can edit a completed order’s 
start or completed timestamp 
to shrink an order using this 
parameter. 
 Yes: order duration can be shrunk 
 No: order duration cannot be shrunk 
 E.g., 
 A completed order has start and end 
 timestamps as 3pm and 5pm, respectively. 
 You can edit any of this to shrink the order. Say, 
5pm can be edited to 4pm. 
 Caution: When you shrink the order, 
 the production and loss data that were reported 
between 4pm and 5pm will be lost, which needs 
to be handled using a customization. 
 Unaccounted Speed 
Loss Limit 
 During the order execution, there 
may be unaccounted speed loss 
duration, which is still not reported 
to OEE as a speed loss. You can use 
this parameter to define the limit for 
unaccounted speed loss. 
 E.g., 10 MIN 
 Enter a time duration with a desired UOM. All 
the time-specific UOMs are listed from MPM_
UOM standard table. 
 Line Behavior 
 Mark Line Down if any bottleneck 
machine is down. 
 Line will be down when even one bottleneck is 
down. (Line has multiple bottlenecks.) 
 Mark Line Down if all bottleneck 
machines are down. 
 Line will be down only when all the bottlenecks of 
the line are down. (Line has multiple bottlenecks.) 
 Multi-capacity single-line 
 Production is reported at line level with the 
option to select the number of capacities that 
will be used for production. 
 Line Behavior 
 Multi-capacity multi-line 
 Line is configured with multiple capacities. Order-
operation can be released to different capacities 
and can be started and completed at each 
capacity. The data collections are done at capacity 
level and not at line level. KPIs are calculated at 
capacity level and hence will look bloated. 
 SAP OEE 
Application 
transaction mode 
 This parameter signifies if the goods 
movement app should operarte in 
online or offline mode. 
 Online: ERP/EWM and OEE connection is 
active. The goods movement app posts the GR 
and GI synchronously to ERP 
Offline: ERP/EWM and OEE connection is inactive. 
The goods movement app data should be archived 
in a custom table and later should be posted to 
ERP/EWM once the connection is restored

 Offline-online 
mode change 
transaction: 
 This transaction would get executed, 
when you are changing the mode 
from offline to online. You can use 
this transaction to take care of some 
preparatory steps when the mode 
change happens. For example, 
you can use this transaction to 
synchronize/post the archived 
goods movement data to ERP when 
in offline mode. 
 Online-Offline 
mode change 
transaction 
 This transaction would get executed, 
when you are changing the mode 
from online to offline. You can use 
this transaction to take care of some 
preparatory steps when the mode 
change happens. 
 Allow PM 
Notification trigger 
 This parameter signifies if the plant 
maintenance notification triggered 
to ERP requires a supervisor 
approval or not 
 No: PM Notification in triggered automatically 
to ERP without any supervisors approval 
Yes: PM Notification requires supervisors 
approval before triggered to ERP 
 Allow multiple 
orders to be started 
at same time 
 This parameter decides if single or 
multiple order can be executed in 
a line. 
 Yes: You can start multiple orders from the 
dashboard. 
No: Only one order/operation can be started 
and executed at a given point of time. The 
second order/operation can be started only after 
completing the first order/operation. 
 PM Notification 
type 
 This parameter signifies the type of 
notification that you wish to handle 
in OEE when triggered to ERP. 
 Example: M1, M2. Ensure the configured 
notification types exist already in ERP 
 SAP ERP type 
 From OEE_MII 15.0 SP06 and OEE_
MII 15.1 SP01 onwards, S4Hana is 
supported in OEE. The corresponding 
supported OEE_ERP version is 
OEE_ERP 15.0 SP02. This means if the 
ERP system is on S4HANA system, 
OEE would work with Plant Hierarchy 
creation in S4HANA system and 
download to MII. There are 3 Options 
for this customization. 
 Ehp: ERP is on normal Ehp or Suite on HANA 
system. Compatibility mode: ERP system is on 
S4HANA system but running in Compatibility 
Mode. 
Target Mode: ERP system is on S4HANA 
system but running in Target mode.The above 
enhancement was done to support long 
material number in S4HANA.

■ APPENDIX 
 Section 5: Extension Configuration 
 In this section, you will learn about the request and response XML structures of all the OEE standard 
methods seen under extension configuration. These XML structures are to be followed when developing 
custom OEE extensions. 
 In the custom MII transaction, the following three parameters are to be defined as transaction 
properties. The respective request and response structure is to be utilized. For example, if the custom 
extension is hooked to the post of the “Order Complete” method, then the  OutputString XML of the 
“Complete Order” method should be passed to the  Input transaction property of your custom MII 
transaction to get the order completed details. All these XML structures are standard. Similarly, when a 
custom MII transaction is added to pre of extension, the the XMLInputString is passed with the required 
values from the standard method.
• 
 Property Name:  XMLInputString , Data type: XML and Parameter type: Input  
• 
 Property Name:  XMLModifiedOutputString , Data type: XML and 
Parameter type: Input 
• 
 Property Name:  XMLOutputString , Data type: XML and Parameter type: Output 
• 
 You can check the XMLInputString and XMLOutputString structure for each of the 
extension methods in the below section.
