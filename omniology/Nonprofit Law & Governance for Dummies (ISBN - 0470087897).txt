Foreword
I
can’t imagine American society without nonprofit work, and I sure don’t
want to. Disaster relief, sheltering the homeless, feeding the poor, mentor-
ing young people, and after-school programs are all in a day’s work for chari-
ties and churches in every community.
Helping a neighbor is as ingrained in our culture as freedom of speech and
the right to vote. Many spend precious leisure hours driving the elderly to
doctor appointments or building houses for deserving families. And many
Americans find an extra dollar for the Salvation Army kettle or cancer
research. Some people can give more than others. Regardless, all Americans
reap incalculable benefit from charities.
Reflecting these values, the federal tax code gives generous tax breaks to
non-profit groups. Each year, the federal government foregoes the collection
of about $280 billion in taxes from non-profit groups.
For decades, Congress handed out these tax breaks without much thought.
But then some headlines grabbed our attention. The foundation executive in
Boston who dipped into the charity’s funds to pay for his daughter’s expen-
sive wedding. Organizations that were charities in name only because they
were used as tax shelters by self-enriching individuals. The car owner who
deducted thousands of dollars for donating to charity his 1976 AMC Pacer
that goes only in reverse. The well-traveled safari hunter who wrote off his
entire trip to South Africa by donating a dusty stuffed ibex head to a museum
that never cared to display its prize.
These abuses of American generosity — as reflected in the federal tax code —
were outrageous. They threatened the good reputation of charities. They
mocked honest taxpayers. Congress needed to act, and we did. We made 
clear that favorable tax treatment is a privilege, not a right. With this privilege
comes a great responsibility — by both the government and individual 
nonprofit organizations — to safeguard the public trust. We need to protect
donors by ensuring contributions are used appropriately. We need to protect
taxpayers by guaranteeing that tax benefits given to public charities correlate
with the benefits that public charities provide to society. Government officials
fulfill this responsibility to both donors and taxpayers with effective oversight
and with laws that minimize the potential for abuse while also providing
incentives for charitable giving. 

As chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, I worked to reform the laws
that relate to nonprofit organizations. In my current capacity as the senior-
most Republican on the Finance Committee, I’ll continue that work. We need
to make nonprofit operations more transparent and improve nonprofit gover-
nance. Among all charities, of those that have failed their mission, I’ve found
that poor board governance unites all of them. A vigilant and committed
board is key to making sure charities stay focused on the goals that encour-
age people to give.
Nonprofit organizations play an important role in safeguarding the public
trust. They need to be guided by the best practices in the charitable field.
Those put forward by the Independent Sector’s Nonprofit Panel and the
Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance are two good examples among
many others. This book is another important resource for nonprofit organiza-
tions. It’s a road map on how to meet legal obligations and further the good
work of the charitable missions that are an essential part of the fabric of
American life.

Introduction
W
elcome to Nonprofit Law & Governance For Dummies. This book takes
you on a tour of the nation’s nonprofits in the world of Sarbanes-Oxley
and enhanced financial oversight. Whether you’re a board member, officer,
volunteer, employee, or donor, this book is for you. It’s designed to tell you
where you fit into the gears of the nonprofit sector (which incidentally
employs one out of seven Americans).
Having the big picture straight in your mind helps ensure that you won’t lose
track of the mission of your organization in the details of daily administration
or the pressure of public scrutiny.
About This Book
In the wake of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX, questions have been raised
about the overall health of the nation’s nonprofit sector. In addition, in the
wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina in
2005, questions have been raised as to the financial fitness and oversight of
this important sector of our economy. The sector itself has taken an approach
of proactively governing itself and working with legislators to bring about
reasoned reforms.
The goal of Nonprofit Law & Governance For Dummies is to give you a heli-
copter view of the regulatory terrain, while giving you enough detail to spot
the legal landmines within your own organization. This book is also intended
to give you the level of insight you need for practical, cost-effective decision
making.
For example, this book can help you do the following:
 Understand what types of organizations make up the United States
nonprofit sector: The nonprofit sector of the U.S. economy is larger than
the economies of many small countries. It consists of organizations rang-
ing from informal community groups to private foundations and com-
plex corporate structures with multiple divisions and subsidiaries.
 Understand the role of the Internal Revenue Service: The Internal
Revenue Service, or IRS, is the primary federal organization that regu-
lates nonprofit organizations. It wields the power to grant, deny, or
revoke organizations’ tax-exempt status.

 Comply with state laws and regulations: Even though the federal gov-
ernment is the primary arbiter of tax-exempt status, states take an avid
interest in what types of entities are formed, how funds are solicited,
and other activities that are conducted within their borders.
 Avoid lawsuits and adverse regulatory actions: This book, although not
intended as a substitute for a good securities lawyer or certified public
accountant, takes a hard look at the types of liability that board mem-
bers, officers, employees, and other volunteers can incur when they’re
involved in carrying out the mission of a nonprofit organization. It also
gives you an idea of who incurs liability under SOX and how you can
avoid having your company (or yourself) added to the list of litigants.
 Anticipate future rules and trends: Regulation of the nonprofit sector is
constantly evolving, and it has gained momentum following the highly
publicized scandals involving such organizations as the Red Cross and
the United Way. This book takes a look at how new regulations and
scrutiny may affect nonprofits at all levels.
Conventions Used in This Book
It’s unfortunate, but true: Understanding the nonprofit sector and the laws
that apply to these organizations means that you’re going to run into lots of
legal jargon and accounting minutiae. To give you a jump-start, we define
some legal and accounting terms in this book and use italics to make such
terms stand out a bit.
Also, so that they’re easy to spot and easy to read, we have placed all Web
sites (and there are plenty!) in monofont.
What You’re Not to Read
We occasionally wander off-topic to discuss something historical, technical,
or interesting (or, at least, interesting to us!). In these instances, we set the
discussions apart by placing them in sidebars, which are the gray boxes that
you’ll see from time to time throughout the book. Because the text in side-
bars is nonessential, feel free to skip it if it doesn’t interest you.
What We Assume About You
In writing this book, we had to make a few assumptions about who our read-
ers would be and what kind of information they’d be looking for. First of all,
2
Nonprofit Law & Governance For Dummies 

we assume that you want to understand the legal and regulatory issues facing
nonprofits in a way that you can’t achieve by suffering through the thousands
of pages of statutes and regulations, including the Internal Revenue Code. We
also assume that you want to keep up with the most important legislation
and standards regarding nonprofits and that you want to figure out exactly
how they affect your organization.
Whether you’re a board member, executive director, staff person, volunteer,
donor, or you head up a private foundation, this book is for you. Nearly
everyone in the United States has some sort of stake in the vitality of our
nation’s nonprofit sector. This book helps you understand some of the follow-
ing issues, which are universal concerns to nonprofit stakeholders:
 How an effective nonprofit should operate
 The complex overlay of federal and state laws that apply to nonprofits,
including IRS regulations
 What standards should be voluntarily adopted by your organization
 How to maintain an effective and smoothly functioning nonprofit board
 The best ways to stay true to the mission of your organization
How This Book Is Organized
Nonprofit organizations vary widely in size, mission, organizational structure,
and practices. The index and table of contents can help you find your way to
the parts of the book that are most relevant to your organization. The chap-
ters in this book treat each topic independently without assuming you’ve
read previous chapters (as a textbook might), so you can use them as refer-
ences and jump around to find what you need. Nonprofit Law & Governance is
divided into six parts, which we explain in the following sections.
Part I: Nonprofits in the 21st Century
This part of the book looks at the historical mission of nonprofits and the
role that they have played in the United States economy over the last 200
years. It explains why the government gives these organizations a “free ride”
by exempting them from federal and state taxes. It explains how the Internal
Revenue Service and the states work in tandem to weave a regulatory frame-
work that protects donors, stakeholders, and intended beneficiaries of non-
profit organizations.
3
Introduction

Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits
This part of the book delves into the basics of how nonprofits are organized
and the critical characteristics they all share. It also explains the legal and
regulatory environments in which all nonprofits operate, and the administra-
tive and organizational structures they must have in place to carry out their
missions. This part ends with a chapter that can guide you through the sticky
subject of compensating officers and directors.
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit 
to Meet Its Mission
This part explores some of the different types of legal entities (such as trusts
and corporations) that can be formed to operate nonprofits. It also explains
the duties that you’ll assume if you agree to become part of a nonprofit board
of directors, and it explores the difficulties in recruiting, compensating, and
keeping good board members. Finally, it delves into the area of creating effec-
tive committees and delegating board functions to them (with an entire chap-
ter devoted to audit committees).
Part IV: Some Special Types of Nonprofits
This part of the book takes you on a tour of the types of organizations that
make up the nonprofit sector. They range from small, unincorporated associ-
ations and community groups to large private foundations, cooperatives, and
multimillion-dollar corporations that rival their private sector counterparts
in terms of their impact and influence on the American economy.
Part V: Legal Landmines
It’s a sad fact that a few nonprofits run astray of their missions and encounter
lawsuits, regulatory actions, and negative publicity. This part looks at the
common mistakes that even some of the nation’s largest nonprofits have
made. This peek at the common mistakes can help you identify strategies so
that your organization can avoid suffering the same fate.
For example, this part explains how to avoid common tax traps (such as fail-
ing to pay tax on unrelated business income) and activities that may cause
your organization to lose its tax-exempt status. It also offers information on
4
Nonprofit Law & Governance For Dummies 

communicating effectively with the IRS in case questions arise, and gives you
some tips for the sticky situations that even the most conscientious nonprofit
organizations might encounter.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
The short chapters in this part offer checklists on important topics that can
help board members and organizations avoid difficult situations. It suggests
questions to ask before agreeing to serve on a nonprofit board, summarizes
common ways that organizations lose their tax-exempt status, and provides a
list of good Web site resources that can help you and your organization on a
daily basis. We round out this part with a chapter on the ten ways you can
use the media to your advantage.
Part VII: Appendixes
The appendixes in this book contain useful reference materials that you can
actually put to use in your organization. You’ll find sample nonprofit bylaws
and a sample audit committee report. You’ll also find a directory of contact
information for state and regulatory authorities and select articles from the
Model Nonprofit Corporation Act of 1987.
Icons Used in This Book
For Dummies books use little pictures, called icons, to flag parts of the text
that stand out from the rest for one reason or another. Here’s what the icons
in this book mean:
Time is money. When you see this icon, your attention’s being directed to a
compliance shortcut or timesaving tip.
This icon signals the type of advice you may get in a lawyer’s office if your
organization were paying the exorbitant going rates. Of course, the information
highlighted by this icon is no substitute for sound legal advice from your orga-
nization’s attorney, who actually knows the facts of your individual situation.
This icon indicates that you’re getting the kind of tip your audit or CPA firm
might dispense. But remember, you should actually consult a real accounting
professional before acting on anything that follows this icon.

This is a heads-up warning to help you avoid compliance mistakes, legal
traps, and audit imbroglios.
This icon flags particularly noteworthy information — stuff you shouldn’t
forget.
Where to Go from Here
Because we wrote each chapter of this book as a stand-alone treatment of the
topic covered, you can start with Chapter 1 and read the whole book, or you
can skip around and brush up on only the topics that interest you at the
moment. If you’re new to the nonprofit sector, we recommend that you start
with Part I. If you’re hip to nonprofit governance issues, skip ahead to the
parts in the book that address your particular needs or concerns.

Part I
Nonprofits in the
21st Century

In this part . . . 
T
his part provides the basics on nonprofits, including
what they are, what legislation has recently changed
their governance, and who regulates them. We round out
the part with a chapter that explains the state of today’s
nonprofits.

Chapter 1
Defining and Scrutinizing the
Nonprofit Sector
In This Chapter
 Discovering what nonprofits have in common
 Looking at nonprofits and small businesses side by side
 Understanding the recent legal changes regarding nonprofit governance
 Concentrating on governing positively and effectively
T
he United States nonprofit sector workforce consists of about 11 million
people, or 7 percent of the entire U.S. workforce. Numbers like these
make the U.S. nonprofit sector the sixth largest economy in the world —
larger even than the economies of Canada or Russia.
To give you a closer look at this booming workforce, this chapter reviews
some of the core characteristics of U.S nonprofits: why so many exist and the
policy reasons that justify granting millions of them tax-immunity.
But there’s even more to this opening chapter. Those people who are running
nonprofits also need to be aware of recent scrutiny and legislation in the 
nonprofit world. Inspired by tales of fundraising fraud, conflicts of interest,
bloated compensation, and careless accounting, state and federal legislators
are hard at work creating new laws to restore public confidence. After crack-
ing down on corporate America by enacting the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (which
lays down the restrictions, limitations, and requirements for the for-profit
sector), lawmakers and enforcement officials are beginning to target the
country’s 1.8 million nonprofits for legislation. This chapter discusses the
ramifications of this attention.

Characteristics That Nonprofits Share
A nonprofit organization is an organization with a purpose. The purpose,
known as its mission, is an overriding goal other than making a profit. For
example, a nonprofit may promote cancer research, improve access to goods
services for low-income individuals or foster arts such as opera and ballet,
All nonprofits have a reason for their existence.
For profit entities (such as corporations and other businesses ultimately
answer to shareholders, owners, and partners. Unlike their for-profit counter-
parts, nonprofits do not exist to generate revenue for owners or sharehold-
ers. Nonprofits do not even have owners and shareholders. Rather, all
nonprofits have stakeholders.
Stakeholders
A stakeholder, as the term inplies, is a individual or group with an interest in
having the nonprofit fulfill its mission. Stakeholders include anyone who’s
interested or affected by the nonprofit organization and its services.
Stakeholders in the nonprofit sector include the following:
10
Part I: Nonprofits in the 21st Century 
The vastness of the nonprofit sector
The nonprofit sector is pervades nearly every
aspect of American culture. Virtually every U.S.
citizen has some type of regular interaction or
relationship with a nonprofit entity. Here are a
few statistics to help you appreciate the enor-
mity of the nonprofit sector:
 Charities make up about half of it: Of the
approximately 1.8 million nonprofits in the
United States, more than half of them (about
780,000) are charitable. The other half fulfill
other missions (such as promoting arts, cul-
ture, business cooperation, social interrac-
tions or public and communtiy goals).
 It’s multiplying like gerbils: The number of
nonprofits in this country has tripled since
1963. It’s estimated that 20,000 to 30,000 new
nonprofits are started each year.
 It has financial strength in numbers: The
vast majority of nonprofits are small, just
like the majority of U.S. for-profit businesses
are. For example, most nonprofits have an
annual gross revenue of less than $25,000 a
year. However, the cumulative revenues of
these organizations are $710 billion, or
about 9 percent of the U.S. gross domestic
product (which is the total value of all goods
and services produced and sold by the
United States).

 Users: By users, I mean the people and parties who actually use the
services and goods created, distributed, or allocated by the nonprofit
organization.
 Donors and funding sources: This group includes the people and enti-
ties (including the government) that help fund the operations of the 
nonprofit.
 Community: Often the surrounding community as a whole will have 
a stake in how well a nonprofit organization meets its mission and 
objectives.
Documentation
Each nonprofit has its own DNA-like uniqueness. However, three particular
types of documentation link most nonprofits: mission statements, charters,
and bylaws.
Mission statements
A mission statement isn’t a legal document, but it’s the document that defines
a nonprofit organization’s goals and reasons for existing. All nonprofits
should have a clear mission statement that’s reviewed periodically to make
sure that it reflects the organization’s current objectives. Not only does a mis-
sion statement help keep the nonprofit on track, it also informs the public of
what that organization’s objectives are. (See Chapter 4 for more on mission
statements, including information on creating and drafting your organiza-
tion’s statement.) Nonprofits generally fulfill their missions by creating and
managing an organizational structure that’s staffed and organized to meet
their day-to-day goals.
When an organization has outlived its mission (or in other words, if the issues
for which it was formed no longer exist), the nonprofit itself may cease to
exist. Or, if the nonprofit isn’t fulfilling its mission, it may be rightfully ques-
tioned by its stakeholders.
Charters
A charter is the prerequisite for official status as a nonprofit corporation
within a state. In other words, it’s the constitution of the organization. This
document, which is sometimes also called a certificate of incorporation, is typ-
ically filed with the secretary of state. Changes to the charter require a formal
amendment.
11
Chapter 1: Defining and Scrutinizing the Nonprofit Sector

Most states require organizations to file annual reports to keep their non-
profit status.
Bylaws
For nonprofit corporations, bylaws outline the basic operating rules for your
organization and spell out how it’s governed. Bylaws include rules pertaining
to directors, officers, meetings, and voting. (Flip to Chapter 4 for more on this
document.)
Funding and financing
Most nonprofits don’t generally conduct their own operations to generate
income. In fact, as Chapter 5 explains, nonprofits are not allowed to compete
with the private sector businesses. Rather, nonprofits typically depend on
the following sources to finance activities consistent with their missions:
 Donations: Private citizens can sometimes get tax deductions when they
donate money to nonprofits. (The specifics of tax-deductibility of dona-
tions are covered in Chapter 14.)
 Fundraising activities: Nonprofits may carry out certain income-
generating activities such as food drives, charity balls, and booster
clubs, but may have to pay taxes on the earnings if they compete in 
certain ways with private businesses as discussed in Chapter 14.
 Nonprofit foundations: Individuals and organizations may establish pri-
vate foundations (see Chapter 11 for more on foundations). These are
special tax-exempt entities generally run by private individuals to
accomplish tax-exempt purposes.
 The government: Nonprofit organizations are often established to carry
out state, federal, and local government programs. These organizations
may receive tax revenues that are allocated for such programs.
Tax-exempt status
Nonprofits generally don’t have to pay federal income taxes on the funds that
they receive from the sources listed in the preceding section. This is referred
to as tax-exempt status. The requirements for obtaining tax-exempt status are
discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.
12
Part I: Nonprofits in the 21st Century 

To receive tax-exempt status, an organization must be operated exclusively
for one or more of the following purposes:
 Charitable
 Religious
 Educational
 Scientific
 Literary
 Public safety
 The fostering of national or international amateur sports competition
 The prevention of cruelty to children or animals
There are instances where nonprofits are required to pay taxes on some
activities that legally compete with the private or for-profit sector. For exam-
ple, if an organization holds a weekly spaghetti dinner, it’s considered to be
competing with the local restaurants and therefore must pay taxes on the
income from the fundraiser. The money it receives from this fundraiser is
called unrelated taxable business income. (You can find more information
about this type of income in Chapter 14.)
The bottom line
Even though nonprofits don’t exist to generate a profit, they still must keep
their eye on the bottom line. They generally have strict budgetary constraints.
Nonprofit organizations may accept, hold, and disburse money and may
enter into all sorts of commercial transactions. Money and how to manage it
is a day-to-day issue for nonprofits.
A more precise term is not-for-profit, rather than nonprofit, and this is often
used in legislation and texts.
Limitations
Because of their privileged tax-exempt status, nonprofits are prohibited from
doing certain things that are completely acceptable for their private sector,
for-profit counterparts. For example, nonprofit organizations usually lose
their coveted exempt status if they do any of the following:
13
Chapter 1: Defining and Scrutinizing the Nonprofit Sector

 Engage in prohibited political activities: Nonprofits are prohibited from
political campaign activity.
 Change their operations on a whim: Nonprofits must adhere to the pur-
poses for which they were established. So, unlike their corporate coun-
terparts, they can’t diversify and evolve freely to reflect changing markets
or community needs.
 Farm out control of their operations: Nonprofits must be governed by
their own boards, and can’t have outside management teams.
Ten of the most common ways that nonprofits can lose tax-exempt status are
discussed in Chapter 18.
Comparing Small Nonprofits to 
Small For-Profit Businesses
Many nonprofits have huge missions and relatively small budgets to accom-
plish them. This imbalance isn’t all that different from many private sector
businesses, particularly small start-up companies with big future goals. To
help you understand how nonprofits function, this section compares them to
small businesses, with which you may be more familiar.
The similarities
If you work in a nonprofit environment, you may notice that your organiza-
tion has the following similarities to a typical small business environment:
14
Part I: Nonprofits in the 21st Century 
Why don’t charitable organizations pay taxes?
The rationale that the courts have long used in
exempting charitable organizations from taxa-
tion is that such entities often relieve the gov-
ernment of having to provide many similar
services (feeding the poor, providing health and
safety services, educating the public and pro-
moting business cooperation). In particular,
Congress figures that charitable organizations
also relieve taxpayers of having to pay addi-
tional taxes for such services.
Each year thousands of organizations in the
United States apply for and receive tax-exempt
status from the Internal Revenue Service under
Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3), which
is discussed more fully in Chapter 5.

 Well-defined goals and missions: Everyone knows what the organiza-
tion’s product or services are.
 Limited resources to accomplish goals: The organization doesn’t have
unlimited resources, so it must accomplish its goals with the available
funds.
 Accountability for achieving the mission: Organizations that fail in
their missions generally aren’t funded indefinitely.
 Criteria for assessing whether goals are met: Healthy for-profit and
nonprofit organizations have created a way of self-evaluating to deter-
mine whether the organization is meeting its own goals.
 A defined management or governing structure: Like private corpora-
tions and commercial business entities, most nonprofit organizations
have boards, management, and various levels of staff that help keep the
organization afloat.
 Identifiable stakeholders: Just as private companies must know who
their customers are and serve them accordingly, nonprofits must ulti-
mately satisfy the objectives and needs of their various stakeholders.
The differences
Just as there are similarities between nonprofits and for-profits, there are
also a few differences. For example, consider the following items, which you’ll
find in a nonprofit but not in a for-profit:
 Third-party funding: It’s rare for someone to just give money to a for-
profit business. However donations, grants, and government funding are
the norm in the nonprofit world.
 Participation of volunteers: For-profit companies are generally staffed
by employees who are hired at competitive wages. However, nonprofit
organizations typically rely heavily on the donated time of volunteers.
 Stakeholders who don’t contribute financially to the organization:
Many of the people who are directly served by nonprofits contribute
nothing financially to these organizations. There’s a disconnect between
the financial viability of a nonprofit organization and the perceived qual-
ity of the services or goods that it provides.
Surveying the Latest Legal Landscape
Congressional and Internal Revenue Services (IRS) initiatives, along with
more stringent legislation, are causing nonprofits across the country to
15
Chapter 1: Defining and Scrutinizing the Nonprofit Sector

assess their compliance with the law and to reconsider decades-old prac-
tices. At the helm of this push for change is Republican Senator Charles
Grassley of Iowa, who asked the IRS to look more closely at the inner work-
ings of nonprofits. The Pension Protection Act of 2006, which contains provi-
sions that nonprofits need to be aware of, is also an important part of the
sweeping change that’s occurring in the nonprofit sector.
New legal scrutiny over nonprofits
In 2004, Senator Grassley prodded the Senate Finance Committee to propose
legislation that would dramatically increase federal government oversight of
nonprofits.
He charged that nonprofit groups and individuals are “exploiting” a vacuum
“in the enforcement of the laws governing tax-exempt groups to enrich them-
selves rather than serve the public.” To this end, Grassley publicly requested
that both the Chief Counsel of the IRS and the Commissioner of the IRS’s tax-
exempt entities division look into what is happening in the nonprofit sector
more closely. To regain nonprofit service to the public, Senator Grassley
specifically asked requested that the IRS scrutinize the following:
 Charges of excessive compensation: Senator Grassley urged the IRS to
aggressively pursue cases where it appears that board members or
trustees are receiving overly generous paychecks when taking into
account what they actually do. (Flip to Chapter 6 to find out what 
compensation is appropriate for those who work for a nonprofit 
organization.)
 Unrelated business income: Senator Grassley questioned whether
exempt organizations are abusing tax-exempt status by not paying taxes
on income that’s unrelated to their exempt purposes. (You can read
more about unrelated business income in Chapter 14.)
 The tax-exempt status of nonprofit hospitals: Senator Grassley focused
public attention on the issue of whether nonprofit hospitals provide
enough charity care or other benefits to deserve their tax-exempt status.
 Compliance with reporting requirements by large nonprofits: Senator
Grassley wanted to know how well charities with total assets of $100 mil-
lion or more are complying with the requirement that they file their fed-
eral informational returns electronically.
Despite this aggressive to-do list, Grassley has not been overly critical of the
IRS’ efforts to date. In fact, he has publicly praised the agency for its efforts
to ensure that charities are complying with the federal law that prohibits
them from getting involved in partisan politics.
16
Part I: Nonprofits in the 21st Century 

At Senator Grassley’s prodding and after several well-publicized hearings on
the subject, the Senate Finance Committee issued draft legislation in 2005.
The Committee also agreed to receive legislative recommendations from the
Panel on the Nonprofit Sector, which is a prestigious independent group of
individuals with expertise in administering tax-exempt entities. The panel’s
Web site is located at www.nonprofitpanel.org.
Some of the ideas from Congress and other sources that the Committee dis-
cussed included the following:
 Increasing IRS authority: The Committee considered granting the IRS
greater enforcement powers to address the perceived violations of tax-
exempt status.
 Ratcheting up Form 990 filing requirements: By enhancing Form 990
filing requirements, the committee hoped to increase the transparency
of tax-exempt organizations. (Form 990 is discussed in greater detail in
Chapter 7.)
 Requiring nonprofits to periodically reconfirm their tax-exempt
status.
17
Chapter 1: Defining and Scrutinizing the Nonprofit Sector
Shining the spotlight on some specific charities
Some of the groups that Senator Grassley tar-
geted in his scrutiny of nonprofits include the
Edward Orton Jr. Ceramic Foundation in
Westerville, Ohio, the Musculoskeletal Transplant
Foundation in Edison, N.J., and the National
Association of Investors Corporation in Madison
Heights, Mich.
According to Senate Finance Committee find-
ings, the organizations generated significant
amounts of income that were unrelated to their
tax-exempt purpose, but they didn’t pay taxes
on those funds. Senator Grassley further
alleged that key officials of the organizations
appeared to be overpaid.
J. Gary Childress, the Orton Foundation’s gen-
eral manager, steadfastly defended his organi-
zation’s tax-exempt status in the media.
Childress denied that Orton violated any laws or
overpaid any employees. He explained that the
court had affirmed the IRS’s determination of
Orton’s tax-exempt status in 1971. He explained
that Orton didn’t have to pay tax on its sales of
ceramics because they were related to its char-
itable purpose of furthering research in the field
of industrial ceramics.
Similarly, representatives of the Musculoskeletal
Transplant Foundation defended its tax-exempt
status by explaining that their organization pro-
vides products that for-profit companies do not.
“Given the altruistic nature of tissue donation,
MTF strongly believes that its tissue banking is a
tax-exempt activity that should continue to be
performed by nonprofit, charitable organizations
and should not be not subject to taxes as an
unrelated business activity.”

The Pension Protection Act of 2006
The federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 is the newest legislation that’s
designed to protect workers’ pension rights. This Act contains many embed-
ded provisions for nonprofits, some of which are actually welcomed by the
organizations.
Ease of revoking tax-exempt status
Prior to the Pension Protection Act, once an organization received its deter-
mination from the IRS that it had qualified for tax-exempt status under Section
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, that status remained in effect forever

Part I: Nonprofits in the 21st Century 
The Red Cross versus Senator Grassley
In December 2006, Senator Grassley took aim at
one of the largest and most established non-
profit targets in the United States: the American
Red Cross. In a well-publicized letter, he asked
the Red Cross to explain in detail how its board
operates. He requested copies of all board
meeting minutes for the past five years, a
description of the duties of the board, corre-
spondence and e-mails between board mem-
bers and its chief executive officer, and copies
of the agency’s internal evaluations.
In his letter and accompanying press state-
ments, Senator Grassley questioned the effec-
tiveness of the governing board. His demand for
an investigation came in response to charges
that the agency had responded slowly and inef-
ficiently to Hurricane Katrina and had misman-
aged funds meant for victims of the September
11 terrorist attacks.
Finally, Senator Grassley explained that “the
name and notoriety of the Red Cross make it
essential for those governing the organization
to go the extra mile to ensure public confidence
not only in the Red Cross but in the nonprofit
sector generally.”
Here’s the Red Cross’s response to the publicity:
“We are fully cooperating with the Senate
Finance Committee and Chairman Grassley in
response to their questions regarding the oper-
ations of the American Red Cross. The
American Red Cross is committed to learning
from our prior challenges and making the nec-
essary changes to improve the delivery of ser-
vices to the American people.
The Red Cross wants to implement the best cor-
porate governance practices found in the chari-
table and for-profit sectors. We are encouraged
that Senator Grassley, in his letter today, agrees
that “there is no daylight between us in that
common goal.” To that end, the American Red
Cross has initiated an independent governance
review and will soon host a summit on corporate
governance best practices, all with the purpose
of developing concrete recommendations.
Because the Red Cross exists to fulfill a vital
national mission, we bear an exceptional
burden to ensure that we meet and exceed the
expectations of those whom we serve and of
those who selflessly donate their time, money
and blood.”

unless revoked by the IRS. Now, under Section 1223(b) of the Pension
Protection Act, tax status is automatically revoked if the organization fails to
file Form 990 three years in a row. Form 990 is the informational return that
the IRS requires nonprofit organizations to file. (This form and all its require-
ments are discussed in Chapter 7.)
Record-keeping requirements
Save your receipts! Under the new law, no tax deductions are allowed for
cash contributions without a receipt, canceled check, or credit card state-
ment. You don’t need to mail these things in with your tax returns, but you do
need to keep the receipts and other documentation with your copy of the
return in case you’re stuck with an IRS audit.
The new law also toughens the rules for noncash donations. If you donate
items such as cars, clothing, and household goods to a charity, they must be
in good condition.
New tracking of tiny nonprofits
For the last 40 years, the IRS has exempted small organizations from having
to maneuver the complexities of IRS Form 990. This exemption meant that 
the local church bake sale and other programs with annual revenues under
$25,000 didn’t have to file anything with the IRS. However, they were still
required to comply with state laws. This is no longer true.
With the new Pension Protection Act, these small nonprofit groups are now
required to provide the following information to the IRS:
 The legal name of the organization
 Any name under which such organization operates or does business
 The organization’s mailing address and Web address (if any)
 The organization’s taxpayer identification number
 The name and address of a principal officer
 Evidence of the continuing basis for the organization’s exemption from
the filing requirements (such as documents verifying its status with
state governments)
It remains to be seen what the new IRS “notice” form for small organizations
will include. The requirement that organizations offer up “evidence” pretty
much assures that some new type of IRS form will be created and required
even for the smallest organizations.
19
Chapter 1: Defining and Scrutinizing the Nonprofit Sector

The implications of revocation
The IRS publishes a new shaming list of the organizations that have had their
tax-exempt status revoked due to failure to file returns or notices, which
means that donors who make gifts after the lists are published will be denied
a deduction. And you know what that means: You’ll have some angry donors
who will spread the negative news far and wide. As you can imagine, that’s
not good for an organization’s bottom line. As if that bad publicity weren’t
enough, the organizations also have to reapply for tax-exempt status (not a
fun weekend task). If an organization can show “reasonable cause” for failure
to file the return or notice, exemption may be granted retroactively to the
date of the loss of exemption.
Focusing on Good Governance
Institutes and seminars have sprung up across the country to help nonprofits
govern themselves more effectively. Many nonprofit organizations are also
voluntarily complying with Sarbanes-Oxley, a stringent law passed to govern
for-profit corporations. This law was passed in response to the bankruptcies
of Enron and Worldcom and was aimed at corporate corruption. Corporations
have spent billions to comply with this law. Nonprofits, though legally exempt
from most of Sarbanes-Oxley, are facing a confidence crisis of their own due
to this far-reaching law. Desperate to avoid the public scrutiny bestowed on
the Red Cross and United Way (both of which were caught up in nasty scan-
dals), many nonprofits are adopting Sarbanes-Oxley standards on a voluntary
basis. Check out Chapter 13 for more on these corporate standards in the
nonprofit sector.

Who’s in Charge?
In This Chapter

A
pproximately 1.4 million charitable, religious, scientific, educational,
and cultural organizations in the United States compete for funds and
government support to carry out their operations. The nonprofit sector
holds assets of more than $2 trillion and receives about $241 billion in sup-
port from individuals, corporations, and foundations. Compared to private
businesses (particularly after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed, as dis-
cussed in Chapter 13), nonprofits have been allowed to operate in this coun-
try with a surprising amount of freedom. However, the size of the sector and
the support it receives from the public points to the need for effective regula-
tion. So, in this chapter, I show you how the layers of regulation are imposed
at the federal, state, and local levels.
The IRS: The Primary Federal Regulator
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) isn’t only the collection arm of the federal
government; it’s also the chief regulator of larger nonprofit organizations. In
particular, it’s the arm of the government that holds the responsibility for
granting and taking away the tax-exempt status of public charities (see
Chapter 5 for more details on getting tax-exempt status).

Because the IRS is the agency that confers tax-exempt status, it has come to
play a dominant role in regulating what charities can and can’t do. Without
tax-exempt status, organizations must pay federal (and in some cases state)
income taxes on the funds that they receive. And to top it all off, the people
who donate to these charities can’t take a charitable deduction when paying
their own taxes.
The IRS has a specific, highly trained Tax Exempt and Government Entities
Division (TE/GE) that’s staffed by specialists in the nonprofit area. These spe-
cialists view their roles less as tax collectors and more as nonprofit watch-
dogs. Their publicly stated role is to make sure that exempt organizations
continue to make the contributions to society that justify their coveted tax-
exempt status. (The role of the TE/GE is discussed more fully in Chapter 15.)
According to the way the IRS looks things, Public charities fall into two 
categories:
 Private foundations: Private foundations are a special type of charity
established by a small number of private donors so that they can direct
how the charitable funds are spent. The private foundation is eligible for
tax-exempt status if it complies with the rules found in Section of the
Internal Revenue Code. (Private foundations are discussed more exten-
sively in Chapter 11.)
Stricter rules apply to private foundations because in theory they aren’t
subject to regulations or required to be responsive to the public in the
same way as churches, government programs, schools, hospitals, and
organizations that get their support from the government.
22
Part I: Nonprofits in the 21st Century 
A brief history of philanthropy
The concept of charitable giving dates back to
biblical times. The ancient Romans also were
quite the community philanthropists. They
founded hospitals, asylums, and nursing homes
throughout the empire. In the middle ages,
churches administered many programs that
bear remarkable similarity to modern-day gov-
ernment programs. Plato established the equiv-
alent of a modern-day private foundation to
support an educational academy after his
death.
And, finally, philanthropy got a real boost in the
United States during the Industrial Revolution,
when benevolent and socially conscious organi-
zations began springing up to stem the tide of
misery that accompanied the wave of economic
progress. These societies and organizations have
remained important though the years. Some
retain the informal structures typical of smaller
nonprofits, whereas others have grown to huge
national and even multinational enterprises that
are subject to complex laws and regulations.

 Other kinds of public charities: Charities that are not managed by pri-
vate individuals (which are the vast majority of charities) fall into this
category. Traditional types of public charities include churches,
research facilities and publicly funded heath care institutions.
U.S. Postal Regulations
Because many nonprofits depend so heavily on U.S. mail for their fundraising
appeals, the postmaster of the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) serves as another
resource for regulating them.
For example, in the last few years, the USPS has really stepped up its efforts
in enforcing nonprofit postal regulations more vigorously than ever before.
It’s mainly concerned with fraudulent or misleading direct-mail pieces and 
in cracking down on for-profit firms that try to send mail using nonprofit 
permits.
In order to effectively monitor and regulate nonprofit postal regulations, the
USPS is authorized, by federal laws and regulation, to do the following:
 Spot-check bulk mail (for things like drugs and explosives)
 Impose fines if abuses are uncovered, such as mailing illegal substances
or using the mail to run a scam
 Require changes in the content of the mailing, such as a disclaimer so
that the content is not misleading
 Revoke nonprofit mailing permits
The bulk mail coordinator at your local or regional post office can be helpful
in answering questions about obtaining and properly using a nonprofit postal
permit.
Federal Election Laws
Nonprofit organizations are limited in the type and scope of the political
activities in which they can engage because of their tax-exempt status under
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The government’s rationale
for this limitation is simple: It doesn’t make any sense for the government to
subsidize organizations by granting tax-exempt status so that the nonprofits
can advocate for their own political interests.
23
Chapter 2: Regulating Nonprofits: Who’s in Charge?

The following is a quick rundown of political activities that tax-exempt orga-
nizations can do:
 Lobby (within a certain limit) on specific issues
 Conduct nonpartisan public education and training sessions about par-
ticipation in the political process
 Educate political candidates on issues of public interest
 Publish information about political candidates’ positions on issues
 Rent their mailing lists to political organizations that pay fair market
value for the information
 Conduct voter registration and participation drives
 Work with political parties on formulating their platforms
The following is a skull-and-crossbones list of activities that 501(c)(3) tax-
exempt nonprofit organizations can’t do:
 Endorse candidates for public office
 Make any campaign contributions
 Restrict the rental of their mailing lists to certain political candidates
 Ask candidates to directly endorse a specific issue in exchange for the
organization’s support
 Step up their criticism of the actions of incumbent candidates immedi-
ately before an election
 Publish or communicate anything that explicitly or implicitly favors or
opposes a candidate
Organizations who engage in these prohibited activities face the loss of their
tax-exempt status, and all of the negative publicity that is associated with
such a loss. Donors may be prohibited from taking deductions on future
returns.
Chapter 3 provides accounts of organizations that have lost their tax-exempt
status after engaging in prohibited political activity.
State Regulations
Most states are active in policing the charities and organizations within their
borders. For example, states generally determine which organizations can
24
Part I: Nonprofits in the 21st Century 

represent themselves as nonprofits, and they make sure that the nonprofits
have a valid purpose. The states also police the solicitation and fundraising
that takes place within their borders.
State attorneys also play an important enforcement role in interpreting the
laws for various states and bringing lawsuits against errant nonprofits in
court. During these lawsuits, state courts have the power and discretion to
correct abuses in the nonprofit sector by rendering in decisions and handing
down orders that deal with specific infractions.
There are no legal constraints on the sharing of information between the IRS
and state revenue departments. This means they can both audit you or your
organization more efficiently!
Fifty laws for fifty states
Where there’s a state, there’s a statute. In other words, most states have their
own ideas and laws about what constitutes proper behavior by a nonprofit
organization. These laws address issues like the following:
 Registration: States need to keep tabs on who’s operating nonprofit
organizations within their borders. To get this information, states usu-
ally require nonprofits to fill out some type of current registration 
document.
 State taxation: States are responsible for deciding whether organizations
within their borders are required to pay income, sales and use, and
property taxes.
 Regulation of solicitation: States want to know who’s knocking on
doors, sending flyers, or telephoning people for money within their bor-
ders. Most states have a division of a consumer affairs organization that
monitors charitable solicitation activities. At a minimum, states usually
require organizations that are soliciting funds to identify themselves and
their purpose.
 Immunity of directors and trustees: Because many nonprofit organiza-
tions depend on volunteers, it’s important for states to have laws in
place that address the issue of whether directors and trustees can be
sued for the liabilities of the organization.
In most states, if registrations are kept current, the directors and
trustees of the organization will be immune from civil suits unless they
commit outright fraud.
25
Chapter 2: Regulating Nonprofits: Who’s in Charge?

 Fraud prevention: State attorneys general play an active role in making
sure that sham organizations aren’t used to dupe consumers into con-
tributing to bogus causes.
 Governance issues: The federal government leaves day-to-day gover-
nance issues to the states. These issues include things like how many
board members need to be present before an organization can vote on
an issue and the terms of board members and how they’re selected.
Does it seem incomprehensible that nonprofit organizations have to pass
through a gauntlet of fifty state laws?
Fortunately, there are some basic similarities in the regulatory frameworks
adopted in each state. These similarities exist for two reasons:
 Nonprofit organizations across the country tend to face similar issues
(for example, the ones listed in the previous bulleted list). This means
that all the states usually cover the same topics.
 Many states borrow heavily from prewritten sets of laws called model
acts, which are covered in the next section.
Model acts: Templates for good behavior
It may seem odd to think that many state legislatures simply cut-and-paste
from another document in passing important statutes that affect nonprofit
organizations within their borders. But process in a number of states, thanks
to the existence of many “model acts” available to states as crib sheets.
Most states have nonprofit laws that are based on a model nonprofit corpora-
tion act and several other types of laws that are based on model acts. These
model acts are scholarly, well-thought-out documents that are created by
special government panels, expert committees, and specially convened com-
missions that think through the important issues and come up with the best
possible legal language to cover them.
After the model acts are written, they’re made available as a sample set of
laws that states are free to literally copy into their own laws, in whole or in
part.
If you become familiar with a model act (or the laws of at least one state that
are based on the act), you’ll have a good understanding of how the laws in
most other states work.
26
Part I: Nonprofits in the 21st Century 

Because each of the fifty states has thousands of nonprofits within its bor-
ders, it’s inevitable that legislators and regulators are going to search for
these types of shortcuts to deal with the most common issues. For this
reason, several model acts have sprung up to help states grapple with com-
plicated nonprofit issues, the most important of which is the Model Nonprofit
Corporation Act. This section takes you on a tour of some of the more com-
monly relied upon model acts, and alerts you to the issues that they attempt
to address.
The Model Nonprofit Corporation Act
The Model Nonprofit Corporation Act is a set of sample statutes that can be
adopted by states to regulate the nonprofits that operate within their bor-
ders. The Revised Model Nonprofit Corporation Act was adopted in 1987 by a
subcommittee of the American Bar Association. This revised Act contains
sample laws on many issues, including the following:
 Requirements for registration with the state
 Requirements for what must be included in an acceptable set of Articles
of Incorporation
 Requirements for what belongs in a nonprofit’s bylaws
The Revised Model Nonprofit Corporation Act is the most important model act
for nonprofits. Its most important provisions are reproduced in Appendix D.
There have been no updates since 1987. So it’s important to keep in mind
that many of the provisions of the Model Nonprofit Corporation Act don’t
take into account current tax laws and the more recent trends in federal and
state legislation.
While most states have adopted key portions of this Act in some form, not all
states have. And the states that have done so invariably make at least some
modifications. So it’s only a starting point in getting an overview of state law.
To find out what the law is in a particular state, you need to consult that
state’s statute or an attorney who practices law within the state.
The states that have adopted the entire model
Parts of the Revised Model Corporation Act have been applied pretty much
word-for-word, in whole or in part, in the following states:
 Arkansas
 Indiana
 Mississippi
27
Chapter 2: Regulating Nonprofits: Who’s in Charge?

 Montana
 North Carolina
 South Carolina
 Tennessee
 Washington
States that have rejected the model
Some states have formally rejected the Revised Model Nonprofit Corporation
Act. For example, Wyoming, Georgia, and Ohio have explicitly rejected the
Act, and have stated that they will draft their own laws from scratch, thank
you very much. This means that even if you’re generally familiar with the
Model Nonprofit Corporation Act, you need to look carefully at what these
states have in their statutes without assuming any similarities with the 
model act.
States that have taken a middle ground
Nearly half the states that haven’t formally adopted the Revised Model
Corporation Act as their own state statutory scheme have nevertheless
adopted some of its most important provisions. These states usually have
laws that follow the Act’s guidance on issues like the duty of care that direc-
tors owe to an organization (see Chapter 8 for more on the duty of care).
The Model Charitable Solicitations Act
The Model Charitable Solicitations Act is another set of prewritten sample
statutes that states can adopt to regulate organizations that solicit (ask for
money) within their borders.
The Model Charitable Solicitations Act was developed by the National
Association of Attorneys General (NAAG), the National Association of State
Charity Officials (NASCO), and a bunch of representatives from the nonprofit
sector. It was drafted in 1986 and hasn’t been updated since 1986 (which
means there are plenty of things in it that are either obsolete or don’t make
sense to follow in the context of other legislation that has been enacted over
the last two decades).
The Model Charitable Solicitations Act has one major notable bug. In 1988,
the U.S. Supreme Court struck down parts of the Act as unconstitutional. In
particular, the Supreme Court took issue with the provisions of the Act that
required professional solicitors to register with the state and provide finan-
cial details about their services. So, as you can imagine, states haven’t and
won’t be adopting these financial provisions.
28
Part I: Nonprofits in the 21st Century 

However, states can (and most do) require organizations and individuals 
who solicit funds within their borders to register and meet certain minimal
requirements. These requirements are intended to ensure that state residents
aren’t duped into donating money to fraudulent fundraising scams.
Many states also require professional solicitors to register. These states may
have specific requirements for the solicitation material as well.
Some states exempt organizations that solicit contributions below a certain
dollar amount. In some states, the threshold exception doesn’t apply if the
solicitation activities are conducted by anyone other than volunteers.
The Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association 
Act: Regulating small nonprofits
No laws require a nonprofit organization to incorporate, or even to adopt any
type of formal business structure. However, many states strongly believe that
some sort of rules should apply to those informally organized nonprofits that
are operating within their borders.
Accordingly, the Uniform Unincorporated Nonprofit Association Act (UUNAA)
was drafted by a National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State
Laws.
This particular model act addresses the following sticky questions:
 Who has the authority to acquire, hold, and transfer property on behalf
of an unincorporated association?
 Who can sue on behalf of the entity?
 Who can be sued if the entity engages in actions that result in civil 
liability?
 Who has the right to enter into contracts on behalf of the entity?
The UUNAA was drafted with the small, informal associations in mind. If your
nonprofit falls into this category, it may not have ready access to legal advice.
So the UUNAA is a good source of legal answers for your organization. You
can find a copy of the Act at www.muridae.com/nporegulation/
documents/unincorp_assoc_act.html.
The model standards for charitable gift annuities
An annuity is a type of investment that you purchase for a lump sum and then
receive principal and interest payments over a period of time. States have
long been in charge of regulating the insurance and annuity industries.
Annuities are particularly relevant to charities because charities invest large
29
Chapter 2: Regulating Nonprofits: Who’s in Charge?

donations that they receive in annuities, or they may receive donations in the
form of an annuity (such as a grant that’s paid out over time). Sometimes
charities even sell gift annuities, which are contractual arrangements between
donors and charities where the charity makes fixed periodic payments to one
or two individuals (annuitants) in exchange for money or assets transferred
to the charity.
30

Having your cake and eating it too: 
Charitable gift annuities
Charitable gift annuities are a flexible way for
wealthy individuals to make a gift of valuable
property to charity during their life, get a big tax
deduction for doing it, and keep a stream of
income from the property that they can use
during their lives.
For example, suppose you want to make a
$100,000 gift to a charity that has a program for
making charitable gift annuities. Here’s how a
typical program might work:
1. You complete a special annuity agreement
contract with the charity, which specifies
the gift and the income stream that you’ll
receive each year.
2. You transfer $100,000 worth of cash or other
assets to the charity.
3. You receive fixed payments annually (or
more frequently if desired) in an amount
specified in the agreement. (The amount of
the payment is a percentage of the gift
based on your age and other factors at the
time of the gift.)
4. The IRS allows you to take an immediate
charitable income tax deduction in the year
you make the gift. In addition to this deduc-
tion, part of the annual annuity payment you
get each year is tax-free for the number of
years equal to your life expectancy.
5. As yet another bonus, in addition to the
income tax deduction you get, the assets
used to fund your gift annuity aren’t included
in your estate for estate tax purposes.
In some cases, if the annuity contract you sign
with the charity allows it, you can choose
another person (typically a spouse, parent, or
sibling) to receive payments if you don’t live out
your life expectancy.
The charitable annuity strategy is particularly
effective if you’re giving a charity a gift of some
sort of property that’s increased in value a lot
since you got it. Normally, you’d have to pay
income tax on all that gain (which is called cap-
ital gains tax) all in one year. However, if you
make the gift, you can pay that nasty capital
gains tax a little bit each year for the duration of
your life expectancy (instead of taking a big tax
hit in a single year).
Also, because the initial income tax deduction
is based on the current value of the property
(rather than what you paid for it), the tax incen-
tives for entering into charitable gift annuities
are huge. At the end of the process you get to
bypass capital gains tax, you get a current
income tax charitable deduction, and you get to
report a portion of your annuity payment at
reduced rates. Plus you get to help a worthy
charity!

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners has drafted two model
acts to help states regulate the so-called “planned giving” industry (planned
giving is a method of making a charitable contribution where some or all gift
components are only distributed, or have their ownership finally resolved,
after some event has passed).
The first model act on this subject is the Charitable Gift Annuities Model Act,
which has a lot of requirements for charities that use annuities as a tool for
funding their operations. (For more information about charitable gift annu-
ities, see the sidebar “Having your cake and eating it too: Charitable gift annu-
ities.” This act requires charities that offer gift annuities to notify state officials
that they do so. The model act also requires that the charities have at 
least $300,000 in available assets. You can view a copy of the act at www.
pgresources.com/draft2.html.
The model acts that regulate charitable investments
Many nonprofit organizations hold the money they get from donations,
grants, and other sources in a trust. They invest the trust assets and use the
income they get from the investments to help fund their operations and fulfill
their missions. The responsibility for making sensible investments rests with
the boards of the charitable organizations, which are deemed to be acting as
trustees (see Chapter 8 for more on the duties of board members who are
considered trustees). Accordingly, the boards are held to special standards
that apply to trustees. The following model acts help states deal with these
issues:
 The Uniform Prudent Investor Act: This Act covers issues like what
care trustees and fiduciaries need to exercise in choosing investments
and what standards are acceptable in terms of risk and potential return.
31
Chapter 2: Regulating Nonprofits: Who’s in Charge?
Nonprofits and the laws of other countries
With the Internet, it isn’t uncommon for a non-
profit organization to attract the attention of
donors (and regulatory authorities) outside of
the United States. But you have to be cautious
because many foreign governments are stricter
about regulating the solicitation of nonprofits
than U.S authorities, whereas others are con-
siderably more lenient.
In many countries, nonprofits are referred to as
non-government organizations, or NGOs. A
complete discussion of the laws of every coun-
try in the world, are obviously beyond the scope
of this (or any) book. However, the overall pic-
ture is a complicated patchwork of laws, culmi-
nating at least one account of a U.S. citizen
traveling as a tourist being arrested in another
country for material appearing on a Web site.

 The Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act: This model act
explains the rights of governing boards to invest the funds of specific
types of institutions such as hospitals and colleges.
 The Uniform Principal and Income Act: This Act, which was created by
the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in
1997, is a good starting point if you want to discover the duties that
trustees are responsible for when investing funds held in trust.
 The Uniform Trust Act: This particular model act contains sample laws
that apply to the administration of trusts, such as accounting for princi-
pal and interest. The Uniform Trust Act is still under development.
Regulations in Counties 
and Municipalities
Government regulation of nonprofits doesn’t end at the state level. Counties
and municipalities also have a say as to what goes on within their borders, and
so they add another layer of regulation in the form of local ordinances and
regulations.
Typically these local ordinances address issues like door-to-door solicitation,
signage, and activities that affect the community. These county and munici-
pal ordinances may also provide for local property tax exemptions in that
jurisdiction’s authority.
Counties and municipalities may require special permits and licensing for
nonprofits to conduct activities within their borders. To find out what
requirements are in effect in your area, check with the local county or 
municipal office or police department.

Adhering to the fundraising standards 
of watchdog groups
In the world of nonprofits, watchdog agencies
pay a special role in protecting the public and in
maintaining the credibility of nonprofits. One
such group is the Council of Better Business
Bureaus’ Philanthropic Advisory Service. This
group has created some comprehensive
fundraising standards for nonprofit organiza-
tions. According to these standards, squeaky
clean nonprofit organizations should spend at
least 50 percent of the funds they get from con-
sumers on the activities described in the initial
solicitation.

nspired by tales of fundraising fraud, conflicts of interest, bloated compen-

work creating new laws to restore public confidence. This time, it isn’t corpo-
rations like Enron or Worldcom provoking public outrage; rather it’s the
nation’s nonprofit organizations that are gaining negative attention. This
chapter presents several lessons you can learn from recent scandals.
After cracking down on corporate America by enacting the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act (SOX) in 2002, lawmakers and enforcement officials are now setting their
sights on the country’s 1.8 million nonprofits. As discussed later in this chap-
ter, many provisions in the Pension Protection Act of 2006 are a direct
response to high-profile scandals in the nonprofit sector.
Unprecedented Scrutiny
U.S. nonprofits are entering an era of the most intense federal and state regu-
lation in history. The following are examples of developments currently con-
verging into a perfect legal storm for the nation’s nonprofits:
 Federal legislation: On August 17, 2006, President Bush signed into law
the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), which includes a package of
charitable giving incentives and safeguard measures as well as a series
of reforms designed to deter individuals from using public charities for
private benefit. The specific provisions of the PPA are discussed in more
detail later in this chapter in the section “New Federal Legislation: The
Pension Protection Act of 2006.”

 Sweeping state reforms: States are passing tough new laws, such as
California’s Nonprofit Integrity Act of 2004, which is rapidly becoming a
template for other state initiatives. The act requires charities with at
least $2 million in revenue to conduct annual audits, to follow certain
procedures in compensating executives, to establish a board-level audit
committee, and to work with the attorney general’s office before fund-
raising. Similar bills cracking down on nonprofits have also been pro-
posed in at least a dozen other states, including New York, Arizona, and
Maine. West Virginia recently started funding programs to educate board
members who oversee the state’s nonprofit organizations. (See the side-
bar “One state’s experiment in teaching board members how to read
financial statements.”)
Many states already have stringent laws on the books, and nonprofits
anticipate them being enforced with new vigor. Fortunately, most state
laws contain common elements for accountability and governance, and
it’s possible for nonprofits, which often operate and solicit donations in
many states, to adopt policies and governance structures that will fulfill
all emerging state requirements.
 IRS initiatives: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which grants tax
exemptions to nonprofits, is dedicating more auditors to its tax-exempt
unit. The IRS is currently auditing about 500 large foundations, which
control billions of dollars in assets, to determine their compensation
practices. Various legislative initiatives have been proposed to increase
the resources available to the IRS to monitor nonprofits, and would
require the IRS to pass more stringent regulations for nonprofits. (See
the sidebar “A new era of nonprofit audits” for more on how the IRS is
more closely monitoring nonprofit organizations.)
Under these emerging state and federal regulatory schemes, nonprofits not
only face new regulatory requirements, but they also face much higher risks
of litigation. Regardless of whether a lawsuit or an investigation is meritori-
ous, the associated publicity can place nonprofits in peril, as donors awaiting
the outcome withdraw critical financial support.
Lessons from Nonprofits in the News
An alarming study by the Brookings Institute found that roughly a third of
Americans expressed confidence in how U.S. nonprofits are run. This climate
placed the nonprofit community on high alert, particularly charitable non-
profits, which survive on donations and public confidence. Because nonprof-
its must maintain public confidence to survive, many have embarked on a
course of voluntary self-reform.
34
Part I: Nonprofits in the 21st Century 

In a survey by the law firm Foley & Lardner, 93 percent of charitable nonprof-
its reported that they have implemented or are in the process of implement-
ing programs of self-regulation to mirror the Sarbanes-Oxley requirements
(discussed in Chapter 13) that are imposed on their private sector counter-
parts. However, few resources are available to guide nonprofits in complying
with the barrage of new laws being passed to make such reform mandatory.
Because many nonprofits rely on public donations and political goodwill, neg-
ative publicity can be extremely damaging. Even if your nonprofit organiza-
tion is publicly vindicated, or some bad publicity is unfair, donor confidence
can be diminished. Moreover, confidence in the organizations’ leadership
may be lost, which leads to turnover that diverts the board’s attention from
its mission for an extended period of time.
This section looks at some missteps that have plagued prominent nonprofits
and that have been reported in the press. These missteps offer you insight as
to how your nonprofit organization can avoid a similar fate.
Lesson #1: Spend donations only 
for the intended purposes
Even if no funds turned up missing and every dollar is used for a positive pur-
pose, your nonprofit can become embroiled in a scandal if funds are spent on
anything other than what donors gave the money for. Public confidence in the
nation’s charities plummeted when questions arose as to how the Red Cross
and other prominent nonprofit groups administered the more than $2 billion
that poured in for the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
35
Chapter 3: The State of the Nation’s Nonprofits
One state’s experiment in teaching board members
how to read financial statements
In West Virginia, a scandal at a nonprofit senior
center made headlines when it was revealed
that the board members, who didn’t understand
how to interpret financial statements, had been
duped into allowing the director to earn nearly
half a million dollars in salary and benefits. State
officials realized that many nonprofit members
didn’t have a clue as to how to read a financial
statement, and decided to take action.
The Secretary of State’s office teamed up with
the private company to provide training semi-
nars for nonprofit board members throughout
the state. Secretary of State Spokesman Ben
Beakes told reporters that state officials may
eventually push to make financial and ethics
training mandatory for all nonprofit volunteers.

While many of the donations had no legal restrictions attached to them, most
donors believed that their donations were specifically for 9/11 relief. Some
organizations used funds for other arguably good purposes. But, this misuse
of funds put them in clear violation of federal and state law standards.
Media accounts focused, in particular, on the Red Cross, which admittedly
used funds designated by donors for 9/11 relief to fund other projects.
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, of the Senate Finance Committee, pub-
licly demanded that the Red Cross turn over a comprehensive accounting of
its finances. New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, threatened to sue the
charity. Previous to this misstep, the Red Cross had enjoyed the status of a
quasi-government agency, with virtually no oversight.
The controversy prompted calls for oversight that have reverberated at
every level of the nonprofit community. It also resulted in leadership change
at the Red Cross.
Your organization needs to carefully track restrictions to which donations are
subject and account for its programs separately, as appropriate. You must
maintain separate accounts to ensure that funds from donors and granting
authorities are used for designated purposes.
Lesson #2: Exercise oversight in 
distributing program funds
In the aftermath of the Hurricane Katrina disaster of 2005, Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) executives and charitable employees were
arrested on federal bribery charges for inflating the number and cost of
meals served at Hurricane Katrina relief centers. The Red Cross also made
36

A new era of nonprofit audits
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) statistics show
that in 2005 the number of nonprofit agencies
nationwide that file annual tax returns grew by
more than 100,000. There are now approxi-
mately 648,600 agencies in the United States.
The IRS expects to get nearly 90,000 applica-
tions from organizations applying for charitable
status in 2006 alone.
To keep pace, the IRS now has a total of 905
workers assigned to monitor the compliance of
tax-exempt organizations. IRS audits of non-
profit groups have increased by 12.3 percent
since 2001, and more than 6,000 audits are pro-
jected for the 2006 tax year.
The IRS has targeted mostly larger nonprofits
with assets of $10 million or more so that the
agency can monitor the greatest amount of non-
profit assets with its own limited audit resources.
The agency is paying special attention to entities
that receive large government grants.

headlines by distributing $6.2 million in funds to a town that was barely
touched by the Hurricane. National media reported that town residents
formed long lines to receive $2,400 payments, which they then used to buy
jewelry and other nonessential items.
Your nonprofit organization must take reasonable steps to identify who is
actually benefiting from its programs and how. This means that boards and
management can’t simply issue policies, but they have to take a realistic
hands-on look at how they’re actually working.
Lesson #3: Compensate nonprofit 
executives reasonably
Excessive executive compensation (as discussed more fully in Chapter 6) is
yet another reason that nonprofits find themselves the subject of unwelcome
media scrutiny.
For example, did you know that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is a
nonprofit? New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer knew, and he sued NYSE
Chairman Richard A. Grasso over his $187 million compensation package.
The suit said that the NYSE failed to ensure compliance with New York’s non-
profit corporation law. Publicity over the lawsuit ultimately forced Grasso out
of office.
Universities also have been frequently questioned regarding their compensa-
tion policies in recent years. For example, the press picked up on the fact
that Harvard University was questioned regarding its management of a $19
billion endowment after it paid a $1.8 million severance package to a former
university president. Following the media reports, Massachusetts Attorney
General Michael A. Hatch ordered an audit of the last year of the fund.
The healthcare industry, dominated by nonprofits, is another favorite focus
of the media. For instance, in 2005, Minneapolis-based HealthPartners, Inc., a
nonprofit healthcare company, was embarrassed by revelations of inflated
compensation packages, contracts between insiders, and excessive travel
and entertainment costs. HealthPartners underwent an audit, and says it
readily implemented all audit recommendations.
Excessive compensation at nonprofits will likely be in the news with even
more regularity, as the IRS ratchets up its audit ratio. The agency has already
identified as many as 200 nonprofits that pay an executive or board member
more than $1 million a year. The IRS has pledged to investigate them and
follow up with audits.
37
Chapter 3: The State of the Nation’s Nonprofits

Compensation must be reasonable. Boards should have some knowledge of
market rates paid to management in similar positions in both the private and
nonprofit sector. If the board doesn’t have this information, it should estab-
lish a compensation committee to research the issue and make appropriate
compensation recommendations (as discussed in Chapter 6).
Lesson #4: Discourage donors from 
taking grossly inflated deductions
Allowing donors to take inflated deductions for property that they donate to
your organization is another good way to attract negative media attention.
(Chapter 14 gives you guidelines for keeping your donors in line with respect
to the values they place on what they give to your organization.)
In 2006, many newspapers across the country picked up on the fact that tax
deductions for vehicle donations cost the government hundreds of millions
of dollars. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa said that his concerns went
well beyond cars. “Donations of land, art, and intellectual property are all
raising concerns,” he said. “The Finance Committee will look at significant
reforms in this area.”
38
Part I: Nonprofits in the 21st Century 
Nonprofits and the bankruptcy law
Among other scandals in the nonprofit sector,
there has been an increase in organizations
filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 11. A
Chapter 11 bankruptcy is a type of proceeding
that allows an organization to “reorganize” and
pay its debts under a plan. Organizations that
want to continue must file Chapter 11–type
bankruptcies instead of filing under other sec-
tions of the bankruptcy code that allow the
entity to fold and discharge its debts.
Usually a nonprofit that’s financially troubled
will fold instead of opting to pay its debts under
a bankruptcy plan that allows it to continue.
Successful Chapter 11 filings aren’t common
because it’s difficult for an organization to
rebound.
Unlike for-profit businesses, nonprofits can’t be
forced to convert from Chapter 11 to Chapter 7
bankruptcy, which is a liquidation proceeding.
If a donation is made to a nonprofit that has filed
for Chapter 11, it’s generally considered part of
the bankruptcy estate unless the donor places
restrictions on the gift.
Among the more prominent Chapter 11 bank-
ruptcy filings is a private New York high school.
This school proposed to change the valuation
on a property, purchased for $4.25 million, to its
true market value, which it believed to be $1.2
million. Several Roman Catholic dioceses have
also filed for bankruptcy in the wake of abuse
scandals. Chapter 11 filings also occur in the
nonprofit hospital sector.

Even though your organization isn’t legally responsible for valuing donations,
failing to look into the issue can cause some embarrassing media moments.
(Check out Chapter 14 for more on donation valuation.)
Lesson #5: Have more than one 
person authorize expenditures
The United Way’s image was tarnished by failing to exercise effective control
over how its funds were disbursed. In 2005, the United Way of the National
Capital Area, which raises money in the District of Columbia and its suburbs
in Maryland and Virginia, was caught up in a scandal involving allegations of
financial mismanagement and excessive expenses and management compen-
sation. Upon further investigation, it was revealed that management had side-
stepped audits and board oversight.
The former chief executive of the local United Way of the National Capital
Area pled guilty to defrauding the charity of almost $500,000. Prosecutors
said Oral Suer, who had served as CEO of nearly 20 years, charged the organi-
zation for personal expenses, such as bowling equipment and trips to Las
Vegas, paid himself $333,000 for annual leave, and misappropriated $94,000
from the charity’s pension plan, leaving the public to wonder what kind of
oversight was in place when checks were cut.
Another scandal involved PipeVine, a San Francisco nonprofit corporation
that processed more than $100 million a year in charitable donations for sev-
eral United Way organizations and Fortune 500 companies. It was abruptly
shut down in 2006 after it had mistakenly spent some donations on its own
operating expenses.
Always have several people in your nonprofit reviewing the signing of checks
and the payment of expenditures to ferret out improper payments before the
press does.
Lesson #6: Operate under established 
and well-documented standards
Though accused of misdeeds, the Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation, which over-
saw the restoration of the Statue of Liberty, stood tall. The agency was
accused of failing to properly oversee the millions it collected, and after the
September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, it was accused of delaying to spend the
funds to promptly reopen the Statue of Liberty. The agency fully cooperated
39
Chapter 3: The State of the Nation’s Nonprofits

with the Senate Finance Committee Investigation and was able to point to its
own written standards regarding management of its funds. Ultimately, an
investigation by the state Attorney General concluded that the foundation
was prudent to not dip into its endowment to finance the project. It noted
that although the group’s bylaws didn’t restrict it from using its endowment,
the foundation had a clearly documented policy of preserving the principal.
The Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation provides an excellent example of a non-
profit board that documented its policies and decision-making process so
that when a controversy ensued it had a paper trail to support its decisions.
So, the point is, whenever possible, document your organization’s policies,
goals, and objectives in the minutes of its meetings or in a memo. This is a
savvy public relations move. If your organization’s actions on a specific
matter are specifically questioned, it will help point out that your board is
acting consistently with pre-established policies.
Lesson #7: Steer clear of illegal 
lobbying activities
On January 3, 2006, Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff pled guilty to three
criminal felony counts, and then his name stayed in the news throughout the
year. The felonies were related to defrauding of American Indian tribes and
corruption of public officials through Abramoff’s actions as a lobbyist.
Several prominent nonprofit organizations have become linked to the
Abramoff scandal.
As discussed in Chapter 18, federal law prohibits tax-exempt groups from
being paid to lobby or perform public relations, and organizations may lose
their tax-exempt status by violating this rule.
Nevertheless, five conservative nonprofit groups managed to splash their
organizations’ names across the front page by taking money from Abramoff in
exchange for writing newspaper columns and calling legislators on his behalf.
For example, if Abramoff wanted Congress to bestow a tax break on one of
his clients, say a whiskey manufacture, he knew that a newspaper editorial
written by him wouldn’t influence lawmakers. But, editorials by prominent
leaders of high-profile nonprofits might do the trick. Abramoff would prevail
upon his nonprofit friends to write op-ed pieces and make phone calls to leg-
islators. In return, Abramoff “donated” several thousands of dollars to the
nonprofit organizations.

In the end, be wary of large-scale contributors who want to donate money to
your organization because of your willingness to take a public position on a
specific issue.
New Federal Legislation: The Pension
Protection Act of 2006
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) contains plenty of provisions that
affect public and private charities, despite its seemingly unrelated name. The
PPA includes incentives, record-keeping requirements, and limits on deduc-
tions. As is the case with any major legislation, it reflects compromises and
negotiations.
New incentives for giving
The PPA includes four new tax incentives to encourage greater charitable
contributions. These contributions may be short-lived, however, depending
on the legislative climate in the coming years. Currently, these incentives are
for contributions made during 2006 and 2007 tax years.
Legislative action in 2007 will be necessary to extend these incentives for
future years.
At present, these four new incentives include the following:
 IRA rollovers: This perk permits taxpayers 701⁄2 years or older to make
tax-free distributions of up to $100,000 from traditional Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRAs) or Roth IRAs directly to many types of
public charities (except certain types of private foundations).
Several high-profile nonprofit advocacy groups (such as the Independent
Sector and the Council on Foundations) are working with the IRS to clar-
ify what happens if a taxpayer accidentally makes an IRA charitable
rollover to a private foundation rather than a public charity.
 Food donations by businesses: The PPA extends to all businesses a
deduction for donating food inventory. However, the deduction is less
than the fair market value of the food.
 Book donations: A provision of the PPA gives an incentive to businesses
to donate book inventories to public schools. According to the law, the
businesses taking this deduction must be corporations.
41
Chapter 3: The State of the Nation’s Nonprofits

 Contributions of property for conservation purposes: This PPA provi-
sion provides incentives for taxpayers to donate land that can be used
for environmental preservation and conservation purposes. It raises the
charitable deduction limit from 30 percent of adjusted gross income to
50 percent of adjusted gross income for qualified conservation contribu-
tions. Adjusted gross income is a donor’s income taking into account cer-
tain expenses and adjustments. So, this amount is less than the taxpayer’s
total income.
The charitable deduction limit is raised to 100 percent of adjusted gross
income for eligible farmers and ranchers, provided that the farmers and
ranchers don’t put a restriction on the gift to prevent the use of the
donated land for farming or ranching purposes.
Tax relief for charitable organizations
It’s important to remember that “tax exempt” doesn’t necessarily mean “tax
free.” Nonprofit organizations do have to pay taxes on some of their income,
particularly when they engage in activities that compete with the private
sector. (Flip to Chapter 14 for more details.)
However, the following provisions in the PPA reduce the tax burden for some
charitable organizations:
 Unrelated business income tax rules: A charitable organization that
controls a subsidiary organization will no longer be required to pay
unrelated business income tax (as discussed in Chapter 14) on certain
payments it receives from subsidiary organizations if the payments are
meant to cover interest, rent, and certain other types of payments.
 Excise tax exemption for blood collector organizations: It may seem
odd to think that donated blood was ever subject to a tax. However, the
PPA now specifically exempts some blood collector organizations from
certain excise taxes with respect to activities related to blood donations.
Requiring written records
The PPA cracks down on undocumented deductions. For example, under the
new law, charitable deductions for contributions made in the form of cash or
check must be accompanied by one of the following forms of documentation
if they’re going to be treated as deductible:
42
Part I: Nonprofits in the 21st Century 

 A cancelled check
 A receipt or letter from the charity
 Some other reliable written records showing the name of the charity, the
nature of the contribution, and the amount of the donation
The rule for requiring a written receipt from the charity for cash contribu-
tions of $250 or more (which existed prior to the PPA) is still in effect.
The end of some charitable loopholes
There’s seemingly no end to the ways that private individuals will attempt to
profit from charitable transactions. Fortunately, the PPA cracks down on
some specific loopholes that have been identified, largely as a result of media
attention. Some of these provisions that are designed to sew up existing loop-
holes include those in the following categories:
 Self-dealing: Effective for tax years beginning after August 17, 2006, fines
and penalties are doubled for violations by private foundations and their
managers of self-dealing and other rules designed to keep private indi-
viduals from setting up charitable foundations to orchestrate transac-
tions. In these transactions, wealthy individuals rather than needy
charities profit.
 Facade easements: The PPA cracks down on deductions taken for dona-
tions of buildings that are subsequently adapted for use by for-profit
businesses or donated in such dilapidated condition that the charities
can’t possibly afford to restore them. The PPA also provides that no por-
tion of the building exterior donated may be changed or altered in a
manner that’s inconsistent with its historical character. The taxpayer
must also have a written agreement with the charity receiving the dona-
tion certifying that the charity
• Is a qualified public charity whose purpose is environmental or his-
toric preservation or protection
• Has the resources to manage and enforce the easement restric-
tions as well as the commitment to do so
The taxpayer must also submit an objective appraisal of the value of the
donated property. (Check out Chapter 14 for more on facade easements.)
 S-corporations: Under the PPA, if an S-corporation (a special type of small
business corporation with less than 75 shareholders) makes a charitable
contribution, its shareholders must reduce the basis of their stock by the
amount of their contribution. The basis is the cost or value of the stock
for tax purposes, and it’s the amount used to figure out how much gain a
taxpayer needs to report when the stock is ultimately sold. The result of
this rule is that when S-corporation stock is sold, the shareholders may
pay more tax when they sell the stock because of the lower basis.

Starting Up and Staying 
True to the Mission
In This Chapter
 Documenting the mission of your organization
 Filling out the forms for tax-exempt status
 Agreeing on the right entity
 Becoming an incorporated organization
 Looking for leadership
E
very nonprofit organization has a reason for being. That is, every organi-
zation has a goal and a purpose. Unfortunately, not everyone within your
organization or within the Internal Revenue Service may agree on what that
purpose is. Add into the mix the expectations of donors and the people
behind the causes that your organization is supposed to serve, and you can
probably embroil even the most well-conceived nonprofit into a controversy
that will keep it from ever establishing a single goal.
So that your organization doesn’t suffer the same fate, this chapter helps you
create a mission statement (which will publicly identify your nonprofit’s goals
and purposes), qualify for your initial tax-exempt status, and create the basic
legal paperwork you need to remain credible and controversy-free in the
start-up stages.
Making the Mission Matter
A mission statement tells the world why your organization exists and what it
hopes to accomplish in the future. Donors and granting authorities, in partic-
ular, want to know what you plan to do with the funds they give you. For this

reason alone, the mission statement is the most important public relations
release your organization will ever make.
Using the mission statement as a roadmap
Marketing isn’t the only reason to have a mission statement. Among other
things, the mission statement provides a roadmap that can be critical to an
organization in times of turmoil.
Failure to clearly state and communicate your organization’s mission can
cause your organization to
 Be confused about the organization’s goals: Boards need direction and
stated objectives. If the objectives aren’t stated at the outset, the poten-
tial for internal controversy and strife increases exponentially.
 Miss the real mission: If the mission is too narrowly stated, the board
may construe the organization’s objectives cautiously (and therefore too
narrowly), which can cause it to miss some of the possibilities for best
achieving its goals.
 Outlive its purpose: Sometimes organizations cease to serve the pur-
pose for which they were created. If the board members realize that
their organization has outlived its mission, they may need to make a log-
ical decision as to whether the organization should continue to exist.
Summing it up in a single statement
A mission statement is generally a sentence not a speech. Its goal is to sum
up the purpose of your organization in a way that’s easily remembered and
often repeated. The mission statement of your organization should be a
single sentence stating the following:
 The full name of your organization: Because the name of your organiza-
tion alone may not reflect its goals, the mission statement should always
include the name of the organization so that it becomes inextricably
associated with the organization’s goals and objective.
Some organizational names don’t provide much information until the
organization becomes well-known. For example both “Big Brothers/Big
Sisters of America” and “Red Cross” don’t provide the same information
as a name like “American Cancer Society.” If your organization isn’t well-
known initially, and its name isn’t particularly descriptive, you want
your mission statement to be particularly clear and you want to strive to
have it appear whenever your organization receives press coverage,
publicity, or acknowledgment.
48
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

 What your organization does: Use positive, goal-oriented terms to
encompass the broadest objectives of your organization. For example,
the goal of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America is to make a “positive dif-
ference in the lives of youth . . .”
 Who your organization impacts: The human and economic impact of a
benevolent organization often extends well beyond the people it directly
serves. Accordingly, your mission statement should reflect the broadest
community impact of the organization’s programs and services, while
still identifying the targeted nature of its services.
For example, the Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America mission statement
identifies children and youth as its scope. Note, however, that it doesn’t
narrow its scope to kids with particular issues. Instead, it identifies the
broadest segment of the population that it serves.
 Where your organization operates (when applicable): Sometimes orga-
nizations are local or regional in their missions or operations. If this is
the case with your organization, your mission statement should expressly
state the geographical area that it targets or in which it operates, so that
the public knows who’s served.
Picking up ideas from some 
model mission statements
The most effective mission statements tend to be those that resonate the
spirit and purpose of the organization. Here are some existing examples of
effective mission statements:
 American Cancer Society: The American Cancer Society’s international
mission concentrates on capacity building in developing cancer societies
and on collaboration with other cancer-related organizations throughout
the world in carrying out shared strategic directions.
 Northumberland Big Sisters Big Brothers: Northumberland Big Sisters
Big Brothers is a non-profit, volunteer-based organization dedicated to
meeting the needs of children ages 6–18, by fostering self-worth, positive
growth and a sense of belonging primarily through one-to-one friendships
with mature and caring mentors.
 Alliance for Children & Families: Our mission is to fuse intellectual capi-
tal with superior membership services in order to strengthen the capacities
of North America’s nonprofit child and family serving organizations to
serve and to advocate for children, families and communities so that
together we may pursue our vision of a healthy society and strong commu-
nities for all children and families.
49
Chapter 4: Starting Up and Staying True to the Mission

Drafting the mission statement
Although mission statements are generally almost always approved by an
entire board, they aren’t always written by the board. Groups may be great
for brainstorming, but they’re usually not terrific at reaching a consensus on
a succinctly worded written product. Instead, it’s best if your organization’s
mission statement is drafted by one person. This one person can draft the
mission statement alone or after group input.
Some boards actually go on retreats to brainstorm the mission statement. It’s
also not uncommon for the board members of the largest organizations to
hire high-priced consultants and public relations people to help them draft
the right mission statement.
After your draft is finished, you need to circulate it among the directors. You
may also want to give staff members and stakeholders a chance to review the
evolving statement. Eventually, board members must all agree on a statement
they feel they can support, based on the input of key staff and stakeholders.
Circulate the mission statement to people outside the immediate organiza-
tion to assess how easily outsiders perceive and understand it.
Getting Tax-Exempt Status
It’s a common misperception that all nonprofits are automatically tax exempt
(not required to pay taxes on their income). But it’s just that, a mispercep-
tion. Instead, nonprofit organizations must apply and be granted tax-exempt
status from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
The purpose of your nonprofit organization determines whether or not it can
operate with or without tax-exempt status. If your organization relies on con-
tributions, tax-exempt status is highly desirable because your organization
will be better able to attract donors who are motivated, in part, by the avail-
ability of a tax deduction. Conversely, if your primary source of revenue
comes from membership dues and the provision of services, a tax exemption
may be less desirable because taxpayers can often deduct dues as a business
expense.
To obtain tax-exempt status, a nonprofit organization must meet a compli-
cated set of criteria set forth under the U.S Internal Revenue Code. Section
501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code identifies the types of organizations that
qualify for tax-exempt status, while Section 170 dictates how and when tax-
payers who contribute to them may take their deductions.
50
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

Classifying your organization: 
Section 501(c)
Most tax-exempt nonprofit organizations are listed under Internal Revenue
Code Section 501(c). This code contains an extensive list of different types of
organizations that the IRS deems worthy of tax-exempt status based on their
mission statements (see the section “Making the Mission Matter” earlier in
this chapter for details on mission statements). Generally, unless your organi-
zation qualifies as a 501(c) organization, it isn’t eligible for tax-exempt status
as a nonprofit.
The following is a list of the most common types of organizations that qualify
as Section 501(c) organizations:
 501(c)(3) – Public benefit organizations: These organizations include
religious, educational, charitable, scientific, literary, public safety, and
amateur sporting organizations and organizations for the prevention of
cruelty to children and animals.
 501(c)(4) – Mutual benefit organizations: These organizations include
civic leagues, welfare organizations, and employee associations. These
organizations have a mission to benefit their members or some other
group that they represent or are formed to serve.
 501(c)(5) – Labor, agricultural, and horticultural organizations: This
particular section of the Internal Revenue Code reflects a policy of sup-
porting these groups since the Great Depression.
 501(c)(6) – Business leagues, chambers of commerce, and real estate
boards (such as condominium associations): These organizations have
a quasi-commercial purpose, but Congress decided that their objective
isn’t really making money for the clubs, and so they aren’t taxed. (The
objective of these clubs is really making money for their members.)
 501(c)(7) – Social and recreational clubs: Congress at some point
decided that fun should not be taxed.
 501(c)(8) – Fraternal beneficiary societies and associations: This cate-
gory includes groups like the Shriners of North America.
 501(c)(9) – Voluntary employees’ beneficiary associations: This group
includes organizations such as your health insurance group or people in
particular professions who join together for the purpose of obtaining
group benefits for their members.
 501(c)(12) – Benevolent life insurance associations, mutual ditch or
irrigation companies, and mutual or cooperative telephone compa-
nies: These organizations engage in some sort of activity that’s mutually
beneficial, but not in and of itself engaged in making a profit.
51
Chapter 4: Starting Up and Staying True to the Mission

 501(c)(13) – Cemetery companies: Here’s one section of the law that
allows you to avoid taxes, but not death.
 501(c)(14) – State chartered credit unions and mutual reserve funds:
These are organizations that provide banking and other services to their
members without themselves earning a profit.
 501(c)(15) – Mutual insurance companies or associations: This is
another form of a cooperative organization unique to the insurance
industry.
 501(c)(20) – Group legal service plans: Here’s the category that the
lawyers managed to sneak into.
 501(c)(26) – State-sponsored organizations providing health coverage
for high-risk individuals: Many states have special programs to cover
individuals with health insurance that otherwise might not be able to get
insurance because of their health status. It makes sense that these pro-
grams, since they don’t turn a profit, are tax exempt. (The Wisconsin
High Risk Health Insurance Program is an example of one such state
sponsored service.)
“Tax exempt” doesn’t mean contributions
are “tax deductible”
“Tax exempt” doesn’t always mean the same thing as “tax deductible.” For
example, tax-exempt organizations don’t have to pay income taxes as long as
their activities remain tax exempt. However, no matter what the company’s
tax-exempt status is, contributions to the organization aren’t always
deductible on the donor’s federal income tax return.
Even though Section 501(c) and other sections of the Internal Revenue Code
define nearly two dozen different categories of tax-exempt organizations, 
contributions to only a handful of these are actually tax deductible. This is
because organizations must meet the requirements in Section 170 of the
Internal Revenue Code if they want their donors to be able to deduct their
contributions. These requirements must be met in addition to the organiza-
tion qualifying for tax-exempt status so that its own income isn’t taxed.
Public charities versus private foundations
A public charity, which is defined under Section 170 of the Internal Revenue
Code, is a nonprofit organization that qualifies as tax exempt and receives
more than one-third of its support from gifts, grants, membership fees, or cer-
tain investment income. These charities are organized and operated (or con-
trolled by an organization that’s organized and operated) exclusively for the
benefit of religious, educational, medical, or other public purposes.
52
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

Under the Internal Revenue Code, the following types of organizations are
classified as public charities:
 Organizations that perform charitable service missions: These organi-
zations include churches, hospitals, qualified medical research organiza-
tions affiliated with hospitals, schools, colleges, and universities.
 Organizations that raise funds for charitable goals: These are organiza-
tions that raise funds to support public charities by conducting fund-
raising activities and acting in a supporting relationship to one or more
existing public charities.
Private foundations, on the other hand, are charitable organizations that
depend on a small number of donors and are generally controlled by those
donors. These organizations are subject to special rules as discussed in
Chapter 11 and typically have a single major source of funding. The funds usu-
ally come from gifts from one family or corporation rather than from many
sources, such as public donations. A private foundation’s primary activity is
usually providing grants to other charitable organizations and individuals
(rather than direct operation of those charitable programs and individuals).
In addition to being a 501(c)(3) organization, your nonprofit organization
must fit the definition of a private charity under Section 170 of the Internal
Revenue Code in order for your donors to deduct their contributions.
Calculating the deduction: Public charities versus private foundations
Individuals can take charitable deductions only if they itemize deductions on
their tax returns. Individuals may deduct up to 50 percent of their income to
public charities, and up to 30 percent to private foundations.
Corporations can take a deduction of up to 10 percent of their income,
regardless of whether the organization they’re donating to is a public charity
or private foundation.
Check out Taxes For Dummies by Eric Tyson for more info on deductions.
Documenting your tax-exempt status
At some point, your organization may be asked to document its tax-exempt
status. For example, many donors will not make contributions to charities
that don’t qualify for deductibility under Section 170, and they will request
something called a Letter of Determination.
A Letter of Determination is a formal notification that the IRS sends your orga-
nization once its tax-exempt status has been approved. Donors can also
53
Chapter 4: Starting Up and Staying True to the Mission

verify your tax-exempt status by checking IRS Publication 78, which is titled
the Cumulative List of Organizations. This publication is an annual listing of
thousands of tax-exempt organizations to which contributions are deductible
as charitable donations.
Filling out the forms
Organizations differ dramatically in their functions, purposes, and roles in
the community. Some organizations provide needed public services, others
allow groups to associate for a common good, and others raise funds for
important causes. However, all nonprofits have something in common: They
must comply with IRS requirements.
Nonprofit organizations generally have to file the following forms with the IRS
(or determine that they qualify for a specific exemption):
 Form 1023 or 1024, which is called Application for Recognition of
Exemption. This form is used by the IRS to determine whether your orga-
nization qualifies for tax-exempt status, and you’ll file one or the other
depending on whether your organization is seeking exemption.
Tax-exempt status isn’t free! The law requires the payment of a user fee
to process the application for tax-exempt status. The amount of the user
fee depends on the type of application submitted and the anticipated
level of your organization’s revenues, but it usually ranges from $300 to
$900 under 501(c)(3) or 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.
54
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 
Your tax dollars at work: Government publications
The Department of Treasury and the IRS provide
the public with several free publications, which
you can get online at www.irs.gov. These
publications explain the process of applying for
tax-exempt status for your organization and are
each assigned a specific number.
IRS Publication 557, titled Tax Exempt Status for
Your Organization, is the primary guide. It dis-
cusses the rules and procedures for organiza-
tions that want an exemption from federal
income tax. This publication provides general
information about the procedures for receiving
tax-exempt status and contains information
about annual filing requirements and other 
matters that may affect your organization’s tax-
exempt status. Publication 557 also has infor-
mation about filing the initial paperwork to
qualify your organization as a nonprofit, about
options for organizing nonprofits, and about
ongoing reporting requirements for nonprofits.
(This publication can be found at www.irs.
gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf.)
IRS Publication 78, Cumulative List of
Organizations, lists thousands of tax-exempt
organizations to which contributions are
deductible as charitable donations (as defined
in section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code).

 Form 8718, which is called User for Exempt Organization Determination
Letter Request. This is a form used to request a specific letter from the
IRS that your organization has been given tax-exempt status.
 Form 990, which is the annual information return. Any tax-exempt orga-
nization with more than $25,000 in annual gross revenues must file a Form
990 with the IRS. (Refer to Chapter 7 for more details on the Form 990.)
 Form SS-4, which is called Application for Employer Identification Number.
Every exempt organization must have an employee identification number
(EIN), whether or not it has any employees, and this is the form you use
to get that number.
These forms are available online at www.irs.gov, under the Forms and
Publications link. After you find the link, all of the forms are listed in numeri-
cal order. Some forms can be filed online, but others need to be printed. In
any event, you can’t save your typed forms unless you have special software
such as a version of Adobe Acrobat, which allows you to save changes to PDF
forms.
If you don’t have online access (or you’re a traditionalist who likes hard
copies), you can obtain any of these forms by contacting your local IRS office.
To find out where your local IRS office is located, call this national IRS toll-
free number: 800-829-1040.
Gathering the right documents
The IRS is a tough tax master. To apply for tax-exempt status, not only are
you required to fill out the appropriate forms (see the previous section), but
you also need to submit a whole stack of documents along with them. These
documents include the following:
 Bylaws: You need to include a current copy of your organization’s arti-
cles of incorporation, trust indenture, or other enabling documents.
Sadly, if you don’t have these documents, your organization doesn’t
qualify for tax-exempt status. Bylaws are covered later in this chapter.
A documents submitted with the application must be a conformed copy,
meaning that it agrees with the original and all amendments. However,
don’t submit original documents! All documents submitted become part
of the IRS file and can’t be returned. Also, all attachments should show
the organization’s name, address, and EIN.
 A description of purpose: This document is exactly what it sounds 
like — a full description of the purpose and activity of the organization.
You should include any standards, procedures, or other criteria that the
organization adopted for carrying out its purposes.
55
Chapter 4: Starting Up and Staying True to the Mission

 Financial statements: You need to include financial statements showing
receipts and expenditures for the current year and the three previous
years (or the number of years you’ve been in existence, if less than four).
You also need to include a balance sheet for the current year. If your
organization is less than 1 year old or you haven’t yet begun operations,
a proposed budget for two full accounting periods and a current state-
ment of assets and liabilities needs to be submitted.
 Miscellaneous documents: The IRS may also require additional informa-
tion, such as copies of advertising, publications, written materials,
leases, contracts, or agreements that your organization may have.
An incomplete application may be returned without being considered. If your
application is sent back because it’s incomplete, the IRS will tell you what
additional information is required with the application and the period of time
you have to resubmit it. In this case, the IRS will tell you that if the applica-
tion is sent back within the deadlines they specify to you, it will be consid-
ered received on the original submission date.
Receiving acknowledgment
What happens after the application is submitted? After you submit a com-
plete application, the IRS sends you a letter acknowledging its receipt (unless
of course the application was incomplete). If the IRS decides that your appli-
cation warrants special review, it will be forwarded to IRS headquarters. If it’s
forwarded to headquarters for consideration, you will be notified.
Withdrawing your application
If you realize after sending your application and attached documents that
you’ve made a fatal error (or have a change of heart), you may withdraw your
application anytime before the IRS issues a ruling or a determination letter.
To do this, you simply write to the address identified on the correspondence
confirming receipt of your application. But, remember, your withdrawal doesn’t
prevent any of the information in your application from being used by the IRS
in any examination of your organization’s returns. Also, any information you
submit with an application will generally not be returned, and any user fee
you paid the IRS will not be refunded.
Opening up to public inspection
Your organization’s application forms and annual information returns are
available for public inspection. The law also requires that the IRS allow public
56
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

inspection of your approved application, including any papers you may have
submitted in support of it.
If any information submitted with your application relates to any patent,
trade secret, or other intellectual property, you can request that the informa-
tion be withheld from the public. In other words, you can request that the 
IRS determine that disclosure of this information would aversely affect your
organization.
If you want to withhold information, your application should include the
request, and should specifically identify the material to be withheld. This
material needs to be marked “Not Subject to Public Inspection” and needs to
include any reasons that the information should be withheld. The correspon-
dence requesting non-publication should be filed with the documents con-
taining the material requested to be withheld.
Seeing your exempt status request 
through the review process
After it arrives at the IRS offices, your application package will be reviewed
by a manager in the Exempt Organizations Determinations division. The man-
ager can do one of three things:
 Issue a favorable determination letter on your exemption: This is what
you are, of course, hoping for.
 Issue an adverse determination letter denying the exemption: This
generally means that your organization needs to go back to square one.
Or you can at least have your attorney make a phone call to the agent
who’s identified on the correspondence you received from the agency
denying your application.
 Refer the case to the headquarters of the IRS for a ruling: Generally this
is done when issues on qualification for exemption have no precedent or
the case is so unusual or complex that headquarters consideration is
justified. This can substantially delay the issuance of any determination
on your application.
After the IRS thoroughly reviews your application and makes a determina-
tion, it’ll send you a ruling or determination letter.
The ruling is effective as of the date of the formation of your organization,
which means that its exempt status is effectively backdated. If the IRS requires
your organization to alter its activities or amend its charter in order to qualify
57
Chapter 4: Starting Up and Staying True to the Mission

for a tax exemption, the ruling or determination letter will usually be effective
as of the date specified in the letter.
You can’t rely on a ruling or determination letter if there’s a material change
in the character, purpose, or method of operation of your organization. You
may need to contact the IRS to obtain a new determination letter. So, be sure
to consult with your attorney if your nonprofit changes its mission or organi-
zational structure. He or she will tell you whether your existing determina-
tion letter is still valid or whether you need to apply for another one.
Keeping your tax-exempt 
status once you get it
Keeping your tax-exempt status is easy if you follow your own rules. Basically,
your organization must operate within the parameters you set forth in your
application to the IRS.
Your status can be revoked for the following reasons:
 Omitting or misstating a material fact.
 Operating in a manner that’s materially different from that which is rep-
resented in your application.
 Engaging in prohibitive transactions or certain political activities that
are inconsistent with the tax laws and your organization’s purpose.
Other less likely ways to lose your status include a law being enacted that
prohibits your organization’s purpose or a decision of the United States
Supreme Court that changes the status of current law.
Responding to a revocation notice
Generally a revocation of tax-exempt status is effective as of the date a mater-
ial change takes place or the law is changed. If the determination letter or
ruling was issued in error or you omitted or misstated facts in your applica-
tion, the revocation may be retroactive.
If your tax-exempt status is to be revoked, you’ll be advised in writing of that
action and the reasons for the revocation. You can then appeal the decision
within 30 days of the adverse determination letter and can have an attorney
represent you.
58
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

Filing a protest
A protest of tax-exempt revocation must clearly identify the organization, its
address, and its EIN. The protest must contain a statement that the organiza-
tion wants to protest the determination. It must also include a statement of
facts supporting the organization’s position in any contested factual issue,
and what law you’re relying on for your position. You can request a confer-
ence with the agent ultimately assigned to review your protest, if desired.
Specific appeals procedure rules are set forth in IRS Publication 557, titled
Tax Exempt Status for Your Organization. You can find this publication online
at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf.
Choosing an Entity Type
Nonprofit organizations generally fall within five types. These include corpo-
rations, limited liability companies, unincorporated associations, trusts, and
cooperatives. Corporations are the most common type of organization.
Corporations
A corporation is a creature of state law, and is generally created under, and
limited by, statutory law. Corporations have a separate legal existence, and
they can buy and sell property, sue or be sued, and enter into contracts.
However, a corporation can’t act by itself. Instead, it acts through its officers
and agents. A nonprofit corporation is formed without the intent of generat-
ing profit.
By law, a corporation can do the following:
 Buy, hold, or sell property
 Own and manage interests in other corporations
 Establish compensation for its employees
 Make donations
 Set conditions for admissions
 Carry on a business and carry on all such activities that aren’t prohib-
ited by law to advance the corporation’s mission and activity
59
Chapter 4: Starting Up and Staying True to the Mission

Limited liability companies
Limited liabilities companies, or LLCs, are entities that have become popular
over the past few decades. The concept was to limit the liability to one or 
a few members of the LLC. These types of organizations have a wider range
of choices regarding organization and governance when compared to 
corporations.
LLCs, which are governed by operating agreements, are generally formed by
filing articles of organization. They can be controlled either by their members
or through management appointed by the members.
LLCs can elect tax treatment either as a partnership or a corporation. The IRS
has so far limited its recognition of tax-exempt status of LLCs to those that
only have other tax-exempt organizations as their members. So, this form of
entity may have limited application for organizations whose membership
doesn’t meet this requirement.
Some states don’t allow LLCs to be used for nonprofit purposes, but that
doesn’t prohibit an LLC from qualifying to do business in these states if it’s
formed in another jurisdiction.
Unincorporated associations
An unincorporated association is less formal than a corporation, but it’s still
recognized as a separate legal entity in many states. States that have recog-
nized unincorporated associations have adopted the Uniform Unincorporated
Nonprofit Association Act (UUNAA), which is a model act that states can cut
and paste into their own statutes. (Model acts are discussed in more detail in
Chapter 2.) Unincorporated associations that function according to the rules
of UUNAA have some of the characteristics of corporations. They can buy,
hold, and sell property and sue or be sued, for example.
Typical organizations that choose not to incorporate include neighborhood
associations, campaign committees, and other associations and groups.
Unincorporated associations, in many cases, are adopted by happenstance.
They generally start as a group of people (a club, for instance) that gets
together to perform some function. The group may have some sort of guiding
document that creates a structure or even officers and members. Even though
none of the formalities of forming a corporation have been followed, and the
association isn’t registered with any particular government agency, the asso-
ciation still exists.
60
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

For small organizations with few wants and needs, the unincorporated associ-
ation often works just fine. It has the advantage of informality, and can still
qualify for tax-exempt status in many cases.
Trusts
A trust is generally defined as a property interest held by one person (called
the trustee) at the request of another person (called the settlor) for the benefit
of a third party (called the beneficiary). Trusts are mostly used in instances
where the activities of a nonprofit revolve around the management and distri-
bution of assets. This is because trusts are generally simpler to administer
than corporations and have fewer reporting requirements.
Nonprofit organizations commonly use trusts in situations where money is
collected, invested, or passively managed. For example, scholarship funds
and grants for charitable purposes are generally administered through trusts.
Employee benefits arrangements, such as tax-qualified retirement plans —
401(k)s — and welfare benefit plans — 419(e)s — also generally use trusts.
Because the trust is a separate entity, it can own and manage property in 
its own name and can distribute such property according to its terms (which
are noted in the legal document that creates it). Trusts can be tax exempt,
but only if they meet the 501(c)(3) requirements discussed in the section
“Classifying your organization: Section 501(c)” earlier in this chapter.
Cooperatives
A cooperative is generally a business that distributes its income to its mem-
bers, but doesn’t earn any income on its own. This is a feature that distin-
guishes a cooperative from a partnership or a corporation.
The primary function of cooperatives is to allocate the economic benefits to
its members based on the quantity of business done with the members.
Cooperatives usually are formed as corporations under state cooperative
laws and have bylaws and other organizational documents similar to corpo-
rations. Cooperatives are discussed in more detail in Chapter 12.
The Internal Revenue Code provides exemptions to cooperatives for income
generated from business done with their members or patrons that forward
the purpose of the cooperative.
61
Chapter 4: Starting Up and Staying True to the Mission

Incorporating as a Nonprofit
Assume that you’ve evaluated all of the various forms of nonprofit operation
(see the section “Choosing an Entity Type” earlier in the chapter for a list of
the forms), and you’ve decided to form a nonprofit corporation. With this
corporation, you may be starting a new venture, or maybe your informal
association or club has grown to the point where you would like to bring
more formality to the organization. At this point, to incorporate, you need to
prepare articles of incorporation, write bylaws, and identify your officers and
directors. The following sections show you how.
Drafting articles of incorporation
In order to incorporate, your organization must file articles of incorporation.
This document, which actually creates the organization, must be filed with
the Secretary of State in the state that the corporation is to be organized. If
the corporation operates in other states as well, it must file as a foreign corpo-
ration in those states.
Here’s the info that’s required to be in the articles of incorporation:
 The name of the corporation: Your corporation’s name needs to be
carefully chosen. Names can be descriptive, imply a purpose, or have no
direct connection with the purpose at all. (For example, Microsoft Cor-
poration doesn’t reflect that the corporation sells software, and the United
Way Corporation doesn’t describe the services of the organization.)
The name of your corporation must contain the following words or
abbreviations (or comparable words or abbreviations from another 
language):
• Corporation, or corp.
• Incorporated, or inc.
• Company, or co.
• Limited, or ltd.
 Addresses: You need to include the following addresses: The address of
the nonprofit organization at the time of the initial registration, the
address of the initial principal office of the organization at the time of
the registration, and the names and addresses of each incorporator.
 The organization’s purpose: The purpose of the organization is known
as the purpose clause. Even though the purpose clause generally doesn’t
need to specify how your organization will carry out its objectives, it
62
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

does need to be written narrowly enough to distinguish it from other
nonprofit organizations.
 The agent: The name of the initial registered agent (the person who
receives all of the correspondence concerning the corporation) needs to
be specifically identified. The agent can either be an individual or another
corporation, and the agent is generally designated to accept any legal
documents in the event that a lawsuit is filed against the organization.
 The organization’s activities: If your organization is hoping to gain tax-
exempt status under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3), your arti-
cles of incorporation need to include provisions that limit its activities
to those permitted by such organizations. You also need to note that the
organization’s assets will be used to further the exempt purpose of the
organization.
 The presence or absence of members: You must note whether the cor-
poration will have people named in its documents as members. Usually,
these are the people who initially help organize the corporation.
 A dissolution provision: This provision generally states that when the
organization dissolves, another tax-exempt organization will receive any
assets of the dissolving corporation.
Depending on the state of incorporation, other state-specific provisions may
be required. For example, directors and the length of time that the organiza-
tion will exist may both need to be identified.
After the articles have been drafted and executed, they need to be filed with
the Secretary of State, along with any required fee. Most states provide an
acknowledgment or certified copy of the articles upon filing.
Your corporation is considered to be up and running after the articles of
incorporation have been filed and the proper fee paid. States usually require
a corporation to file an annual report and to pay an annual registration fee.
These duties are generally completed by the registered agent.
Writing the bylaws
The bylaws of an organization are the day-to-day rules that the organization
adopts to fulfill its mission. As operations change, so do the bylaws. A non-
profit corporation’s bylaws look similar to those of a for-profit corporation in
many respects.
63
Chapter 4: Starting Up and Staying True to the Mission

Bylaws address the rules relating to the board of directors, including the
number of directors, the election and nomination processes, the powers of
the directors, and the directors’ terms and duties.
Officers and agents can also be covered in the bylaws, including their titles,
responsibilities, duties, elections, and terms. Other sections found in bylaws
relate to committees of the board, insurance and indemnification provisions,
conflicts of interest, the fiscal year of the organization, how the books of the
organization are to be handled and who maintains them, how the bylaws are
to be amended, how the organization should be dissolved, and if the organi-
zation is hoping to gain tax-exempt status, a prohibition against private bene-
fit (so that all the assets of the organization will be transferred to another
tax-exempt organization upon its dissolution).
The Internet has lots of examples of bylaws for nonprofit organizations, and a
quick search can get you started on how your organization’s bylaws should
look and feel. For example, you can find the bylaws of the American Red
Cross at www.redcross.org/images/pdfs/bylaws.pdf. Also, you can
find the bylaws for the International Trademark Association at www.inta.
org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1230&Itemid=
84&getcontent=4.
Getting Leaders on the Board
Ideally, an organization would be able to assemble a group of hardworking,
cooperative, and enthusiastic directors who would be dedicated to the orga-
nization’s mission and wouldn’t expect to be paid (or they would expect a
salary far below what the private sector would pay.)
In reality, however, board members have all sorts of backgrounds and differ-
ent experiences with the organization’s mission. Sometimes the board mem-
bers are recruited for their experience in the community, sometimes for their
business background, and sometimes just because they’re well-connected
and can raise a lot of money. The task of any organization, then, is to meld
the backgrounds and strengths of the board members to create a cohesive
group that’s capable of successfully leading the organization in fulfilling its
mission.
64
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

Profiling candidates
Prior to forming your board, it’s a good idea to come up with a profile of the
“ideal” board candidate so you know what type of person and skill set you’re
searching for. Here are some common considerations:
 Personal information: For example, certain backgrounds, ages, cultural
and gender qualifications, or financial status may be desirable charac-
teristics for your organization.
 Expertise in running organizations: Nonprofit and for-profit organiza-
tions don’t differ in their need for effective management — they only
differ in their missions. So, it doesn’t matter if your candidate only has
experience in one or the other.
 Fundraising ability: Funding is the lifeblood of virtually every nonprofit
organization, which means that fundraising experience is a must for any
candidate.
Persuading candidates
Because many nonprofit board members serve as volunteers or for only a
nominal fee, some persuasion may be necessary in order to recruit board
members. At a minimum, persuading candidates to join your board may
require the following:
 Educating the candidates on your nonprofit’s mission: Board members
who don’t buy into the mission at the outset can bog the board down
with indecision later.
 Convincing the candidates that the other members of the board will
be effective: Board members are increasingly aware of liability consider-
ations and public perceptions, and they will likely be unwilling to serve
on a board that’s populated with underqualified members.
 Competing with other nonprofits for talent: Particularly when it comes
to fundraising and managerial expertise, recruiting candidates for your
board may be difficult because there’s simply not enough talent to go
around in the nonprofit sector. You may find that your organization
needs to do some aggressive recruiting as you compete with many other
worthy organizations.
65
Chapter 4: Starting Up and Staying True to the Mission

Conducting meaningful meetings
After you’ve finally chosen your board members, it’s time to get down to
business. And, of course, that means you’ll be holding plenty of meetings. A
perfect meeting in the world of nonprofits should move directors smoothly
through a well-prioritized agenda, while at the same time fostering creative
input. In reality, however, many meetings tend to ramble, which leaves atten-
dees frustrated or feeling as if key issues have been glossed over.
Nonprofits generally hold two types of meetings:
 Regular meetings, which are generally held on a set schedule (for exam-
ple, the first Monday of each month)
 Special meetings, which can be called in accordance with bylaws and
state statutes (which spell out how and when urgent matters need to be
addressed by the board)
To help you make sure that you’re holding ideal meetings, this section con-
tains some rules of the road and some pointers for keeping your board mem-
bers on track.
Giving proper notice of meetings
A notice is a formal invitation to the directors to attend a meeting. Generally,
proper notice needs to be given for all special meetings. (The purpose of the
meeting may be stated, but this isn’t always required under state law.)
The time period to give notice is set in your bylaws or in other statutes that
your state may have. For example, a common provision says that notice must
be provided no less than 10, but no more than 30, days prior to the meeting.
Your bylaws (or another statute) may also specify the acceptable form of the
notice. Some bylaws, for instance, specify that e-mail notice is acceptable. On
the other hand, some bylaws specify that certified mail is required.
Even though notice is generally required, most states allow directors to
waive notice of a meeting in emergency circumstances, such as the death or
illness of an executive director or in the event that the organization must deal
with a natural disaster. This waiver is used when a director has little or no
time to give proper notice. The director usually has to obtain the waiver in
writing either before, during, or after the meeting, and the waiver is required
only from those directors who aren’t able to attend the meeting (because
attendance constitutes a waiver of notice).
66
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

In order to hold a meeting, however, your directors must have a quorum,
which is the minimum number of members that must be present to conduct
an official meeting. Your organization’s bylaws or other state statutes dictate
what constitutes a quorum, but generally it’s a majority. Many bylaws and
state statutes allow directors to attend a meeting by telephone or even
online.
Acting with an agenda in mind
Although agendas vary in style, most follow a set format. Here’s a common
setup:
1. Get the meeting started with a call to order.
2. Approve the minutes from your previous meeting (see the section
“Taking minutes” later in the chapter for details on minutes).
3. Give necessary reports (financial reports, for example).
4. Take care of any remaining items that are dictated by the purpose of
the meeting, which may include substantive matters, as well as rou-
tine issues.
5. Address any old business from prior meetings.
6. Make a call for discussion of any new business.
If an item of new business is raised during a meeting and is expected to
require more thought and consideration than the time for the meeting
will allow, it can be moved to the agenda for an upcoming meeting.
7. Call for adjournment, which officially closes the meeting.
It’s a good idea to circulate the agenda ahead of time so attendees can come
prepared to discuss the issues being covered. If you anticipate that resolu-
tions may be adopted at the meeting, you may want to circulate those to the
directors beforehand as well. Before a meeting, most organizations send
packets to directors that include the notice, agenda, and resolutions. If you
make changes to the agenda after mailing your packets, you can notify the
directors of these changes ahead of time or you can announce them at the
beginning of the meeting or even during the course of the meeting.
Taking minutes
The chances that anyone will remember what happened at the last meeting
(which may be a month from now) are slim. So, it’s essential to capture the
substance of each meeting through minutes. Basically, anyone present can be
assigned to prepare the minutes.
67
Chapter 4: Starting Up and Staying True to the Mission

The form of your minutes will determine what level of information you
include. For example, minutes can either be in long form or short form. A
long form of minutes usually contains detailed descriptions of discussions
and actions, whereas the shorter form only reports on the actions that were
taken with short descriptions of deliberations. As a general rule, the more
important the issue, the more detailed the description of the deliberations
and actions should be.
It’s a good idea to circulate a copy of the minutes of the prior meeting so that
board members can read them and verify their accuracy. Depending on your
organization’s bylaws, your board or committee may even be required to vote
to approve the written draft of the prior meeting’s minutes.

Getting Tax-Exempt Status
In This Chapter
 Determining the tax-exempt status section your organization falls under
 Understanding the application process
 Following through with an appeal if your organization is turned down
Your organization isn’t required to apply for tax-exempt status from the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). However, it should seriously consider
pursuing this option because then the organization isn’t required to pay fed-
eral taxes on most types of income (certain notable exceptions are discussed
in this chapter).
As an added bonus, most states also allow tax-exempt nonprofits to be
exempt from certain types of income, sales, and property taxes. All this talk
of taxes may seem confusing and overwhelming, but don’t worry: This chap-
ter covers the federal requirements. To find out which state taxes your orga-
nization can legally bypass, contact your local attorney general’s office. (Flip
to Appendix C for a list of state contacts.)
Checking Out the “Eligible” 
List for Tax-Exempt Status
A tax exemption is basically a statement by the federal government that says
that an organization is operating for the public good and that the taxpayers
should subsidize its activities as a matter of policy. Organizations that are
exempt from taxes are specifically identified in Section 501(c) of the Internal
Revenue Code. In the nonprofit world, you often hear people refer to non-
profit organizations as “501(c) organizations” because of their location in 
the Code.

Skimming Internal Revenue 
Code Section 501(c)
Because the majority of tax-exempt organizations are listed under Internal
Revenue Code 501(c), it’s useful to look at each section briefly for a descrip-
tion of the exemptions provided to see where your organization fits in the
grand scheme of the tax code.
501(c)(1): Federally organized corporations
Section 501(c)(1) applies to corporations that are organized under an act of
Congress. Common examples of this type of entity are federal credit unions,
federal reserve banks, and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.
501(c)(2): Title holding companies
Title holding companies are entities that provide a tax-free method of manag-
ing and holding title to real estate and other property for their tax-exempt
parent organizations.
501(c)(3): Religious, educational, and charitable organizations
Section 501(c)(3) of the Code applies to organizations that are formed for reli-
gious, educational, charitable, scientific, and literary purposes. Also under
this category are those organizations that test for public safety, foster ama-
teur sports competitions, or prevent cruelty to children or animals. Examples
of 501(c)(3) organizations include the American Red Cross, Goodwill Industries,
the Salvation Army, Planned Parenthood, and the American Civil Liberties
Union.
501(c)(4): Civic leagues, social welfare organizations, 
and local associations of employees
Section 501(c)(4) exempts civic leagues and other organizations that are
operated primarily for the common good and promotion of social welfare or
for local associations of employees. Examples include the AARP and the
League of Women Voters.
Local associations of employees are required to meet two conditions in order
to obtain an exemption:
 Membership must be limited to employees of a designated corporation
or organization in an identified municipality.
 The association’s net earnings must be devoted solely and exclusively to
educational, charitable, or recreational purposes.
70
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

501(c)(5): Labor, agriculture, and horticultural organizations
Section 501(c)(5) of the Code reflects Congress’s long history of listening to
lobbyists in the agricultural industry. The principal purpose of these organi-
zations must be the improvement of conditions of those engaged in the
exempt activities. They must also improve the quality of their products and
develop increased efficiency in the respective professions or jobs.
Labor organizations refer to labor unions, counsels, or committees that are
organized to protect the interests of workers. Such organizations must func-
tion or directly support efforts of the labor group or improve employment
conditions.
Agricultural and horticultural organizations are related to those organiza-
tions whose activities concern livestock, forestry, plant cultivation, harvest-
ing crops or aquatic resources, and other similar activities. An example of a
501(c)(5) organization is the AFL-CIO.
501(c)(6): Business leagues and chambers
Section 501(c)(6) nonprofit organizations are established to further the inter-
ests of their members and include business leagues, chambers of commerce,
real estate boards, boards of trade, and professional football leagues. In addi-
tion to these organizations, other organizations that qualify under this sec-
tion include professional associations and healthcare organizations. These
organizations can’t be organized for profit, and no part of their net earnings
can benefit any private shareholder or individual.
Business leagues, which are also referred to as trade or professional organiza-
tions, are associations of people having some common business interest, the
primary purpose of which promotes that interest. The primary activity of
business leagues can’t be the performing of services for its members, but
rather the improvement of the business conditions to which the business
relates.
Professional or trade associations are those organizations that operate for
the benefit of a profession rather than a business. These types of organiza-
tions engage in public relations activities, work as watchdogs for a particular
profession, or strive to improve the condition of its members.
Chambers of commerce or boards of trade are organizations that strive to pro-
mote the common economic interests of all organizations in a given trade
activity or community. A chamber of commerce relates to all businesses in a
particular geographic location, while a board of trade may refer to only one
or more lines of business in that area. Membership in these organizations is
voluntary and open to all community businesses and professionals.
71
Chapter 5: Getting Tax-Exempt Status

Contributions to these organizations aren’t deductible. Dues, assessments,
and member fees also aren’t deductible as charitable contributions. But they
may be deductible as trade or business expenses by the members them-
selves (for example, a businessperson may be able to deduct her dues to a
board of trade as an ordinary and necessary business expense).
501(c)(7): Social and recreational clubs
Everyone needs to have fun. So Congress decided that social and recreational
clubs are organizations that operate for the public good and are therefore
worthy of exemptions. Congress recognized that individuals who band
together to provide recreational facilities on a mutual basis aren’t attempting
to profit from having their members use of the facilities. This recognition
helped Congress decide to give these organizations tax-exempt status.
The prerequisite of an exemption for a social club under Section 501(c)(7) is
the providing of pleasure or recreation to its members. In order to qualify for
an exemption, substantially all of the social club’s activities must further the
club’s recreational and social purposes. They must also meet both the organi-
zational test and the operational test. In other words, the club must be both
organized for the tax-exempt purpose of providing pleasure, recreation, or
other permissible purposes, and it must operate on a not-for-profit basis.
Examples of these types of clubs include golf clubs, tennis clubs, country
clubs, dinner clubs, and swimming clubs.
501(c)(8): Fraternal beneficiary societies
Section 501(c)(8) provides for the tax exemption of fraternal beneficiary soci-
eties. These are organizations that are operating under the lodge system or
for the exclusive benefit of members of a fraternity that itself operates under
the lodge system. These organizations also provide life, accident, or other
benefits to the members of the society or their dependents. “Operating under
the lodge system” means that the organization is carrying on its activities
under a form of organization that’s made up of local branches called lodges or
chapters. These local branches are chartered by a parent organization and are
largely self-governing.
So, under this definition, if an organization doesn’t have a parent organization
or branches underneath and doesn’t operate under the lodge system, it won’t
qualify as a fraternal beneficiary association. A popular example of a 501(c)(8)
organization is the Knights of Columbus.
501(c)(9): Voluntary employee beneficiary associations
Section 501(c)(9) provides an exemption for voluntary employee beneficiary
associations, which are also known as VEBAs. This type of association pro-
vides for the payment of life, health, accident, or other benefits to the mem-
bers of the association or their dependents or designated beneficiaries.
72
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

A VEBA must be organized for an association of employees, generally
employed by a common employer or affiliated employers. In a typical VEBA
arrangement, an employer will establish a VEBA as a trust for the purpose of
funding health benefits or a self-insured health plan. The employee members
must have a commonality of interest and membership must be voluntary.
501(c)(10): Fraternal societies
Section 501(c)(10) provides the exemption for domestic fraternal societies.
Fraternal beneficiary societies are addressed in Section 501(c)(8) as fraternal
organizations that provide for the payment of certain benefits to the organi-
zation’s members or dependents. A domestic fraternal society, on the other
hand, is a fraternal organization that operates under a lodge system that
devotes its net earnings exclusively to religious, charitable, scientific, liter-
ary, educational, and fraternal purposes. In other words, it doesn’t provide
benefits to its members. However, it may procure insurance from various
companies to provide optional benefits to its members. In order to qualify as
a fraternal organization, there must be a common objective, profession, or
other link between the members. A popular example of a 501(c)(10) organiza-
tion is the Ancient Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, which is the
fundraising arm for the Shriners Hospital for Children.
501(c)(11): Teachers’ retirement associations
Section 501(c)(11) provides an exemption for teachers’ retirement fund associ-
ations. These organizations are operated to protect the financial stability of
retirement systems for teachers and to administer contributions and distrib-
utions of retirement to association members.
501(c)(12): Insurance associations
Section 501(c)(12) provides the exemption for organizations like benevolent
life insurance associations, mutual ditch or irrigation companies, and mutual
or cooperative electric, water, or telephone companies. Eighty-five percent or
more of the income that these organizations generate consists of income
from members. Common to all of these entities is the conduct of an activity
of a mutually beneficial nature.
A benevolent life insurance association is one that’s operated to provide life
insurance coverage to members at cost. However, the hitch is that they’re
confined to a particular community, place, or district. Mutual ditch or irriga-
tion companies are those that operate irrigation systems for the use and ben-
efit of their members.
501(c)(13): Cemeteries
Section 501(c)(13) allows a tax exemption for cemetery companies. These
companies must be owned and operated exclusively for the benefit of their
73
Chapter 5: Getting Tax-Exempt Status

members on a not-for-profit basis. The members of the cemetery companies
are those who own the lots and hold them for burial purposes, not for resale.
A tax exemption under this section also applies to corporations that are orga-
nized solely for the purpose of the disposal of bodies by burial or cremation
(as long as the organizations don’t engage in business that’s not necessarily
incident to that purpose).
Earnings of these organizations may only be used to pay expenses of operat-
ing, maintaining, and improving the cemetery or crematorium, to purchase
cemetery property, or to create a fund to provide income for the care of a
cemetery.
501(c)(14): Credit unions
Section 501(c)(14) allows an exemption for state-chartered credit unions and
mutual reserve funds. This exemption applies to credit unions without capi-
tal stock that are organized and operated for a mutual purpose on a nonprofit
basis. Mutual organizations formed before September 1, 1957, that provide
insurance for shares or deposits are also exempt under this section. Your
local credit union is most likely a 501(c)(14) organization.
501(c)(15): Mutual insurance companies
Section 501(c)(15) provides the exemption for mutual insurance companies
that provide insurance to members substantially at cost. In order to be a
mutual organization, the insurance company’s policyholders must be mem-
bers having a common equitable interest in the organization and they have to
control the company. Many smaller insurance companies are organized as
501(c)(15) nonprofits.
501(c)(16): Crop cooperatives
Section 501(c)(16) provides the exemption for cooperative organizations that
finance crop operations. These corporations are organized by an exempt
farmers’ cooperative or its members to finance their ordinary crop opera-
tions. These organizations may issue capital stock (stock that evidences own-
ership) under certain conditions, and may also accumulate a reasonable
reserve for future operations. It may also own all the stock of another busi-
ness corporation.
501(c)(17): Unemployment trusts
Section 501(c)(17) provides the exemption for unemployment trusts. These
trusts are generally intended to provide benefits to employees who have
been laid off or who have become ill. 
74
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

501(c)(18): Pension trusts
Section 501(c)(18) provides the exemption for employee-funded pension
trusts created before June 25, 1959. This provision has limited application,
and applies to the payment of benefits under a pension plan that’s funded by
employees or trusts that are created before June 25, 1959.
501(c)(19): Armed Forces
Section 501(c)(19) provides the exemption for a post or organization of past
or present members of the U.S. Armed Forces. These organizations are typi-
cally referred to as veterans’ organizations, which must be operated exclu-
sively to do the following:
 Promote the social welfare of the community
 Assist disabled veterans and members of the Armed Forces and their
dependents or widows (and the orphans of deceased veterans)
 Provide care and assistance to hospitalized veterans or U.S. Armed
Forces members
 Carry on programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans
 Conduct religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or other educational
programs
 Sponsor or participate in patriotic activities
 Provide insurance benefits for members and their dependents
 Provide social and recreational activities for their members
501(c)(20): Group legal service plans
Section 501(c)(20) allows an exemption to an organization or trust that forms
part of a qualified group legal services plan. Basically, a group legal services
plan is sponsored by an employer for the exclusive benefit of its employees,
spouses, or their dependents, and it provides certain prepaid personal legal
services.
501(c)(21): Black lung benefit trusts
Section 501(c)(21) provides the exemption for black lung benefit trusts, which
are self-insurance programs for coal mine operators. These programs provide
adequate worker’s compensation coverage for liability that may be incurred
as a result of disability or death due to black lung diseases (those diseases
caused by the inhalation of coal dust).
75
Chapter 5: Getting Tax-Exempt Status

501(c)(22): Employer withdrawal liability payment funds
Section 501(c)(22) allows an exemption for trusts that are formed to adminis-
ter withdrawal liability payment funds. These trusts provide funds to meet
the liability that an employer may incur from withdrawing from a multi-
employer pension fund.
501(c)(23): Pre-1880 veterans’ organizations
Section 501(c)(23) provides an exemption for veterans’ organizations created
before 1880. This exemption was established by Congress in 1982. To be eligi-
ble for this exemption, an organization has to have been formed before 1880,
and more than 75 percent of its members must be present or past members
of the Armed Forces. The organization must also provide insurance or other
benefits to such veterans or their dependents. An example of a 501(c)(23)
organization is the Navy Mutual Aid Association.
501(c)(24): Employee benefit plans
Section 501(c)(24) provides an exemption for trusts established for certain
employee benefit plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, such as 401(k)s, profit sharing plans, or other retirement plans.
501(c)(25): Title holding corporations
Section 501(c)(25) allows an exemption for title holding corporations. A title
holding corporation is organized exclusively to hold title to property, collect
income from that property, and turn that income over to one or more tax-
exempt organizations. To be eligible, the corporation can have not more than
35 shareholders or beneficiaries and only one class of stock or beneficial
interest.
501(c)(26): High-risk insurance coverage
Section 501(c)(26) provides the exemption for state-sponsored organizations
providing healthcare coverage for high-risk individuals. These organizations
provide medical care coverage on a nonprofit basis to its members through
insurance or an HMO. The individuals receiving the care must be residents of
the state sponsoring the organizations, and the state specifies the composi-
tion of membership.
501(c)(27): Worker’s compensation
Section 501(c)(27) provides the exemption for state-sponsored worker’s 
compensation reinsurance organizations. These organizations are formed 
to reimburse members for losses arising under worker’s compensation acts.
Membership in these organizations generally consists of all persons who
issue insurance covering workers compensation lawsuits, as well as govern-
mental entities who self-insure against such losses.
76
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

501(c)(28): Railroad retirement
Section 501(c)(28) provides the exemption for the National Railroad Retirement
and Investment Trust as established by the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974.
Exemptions in other parts of the Code
Even though Internal Revenue Code 501(c) provides the most commonly rec-
ognized tax exemptions, other subsections of the Internal Revenue Code pro-
vide that the income of certain organizations can be tax exempt.
Section 501(d): Relief for religious and apostolic associations
Section 501(d) of the Internal Revenue Code provides an exemption for reli-
gious and apostolic associations that have a common treasury or community
treasury, even if they’re engaged in business for the common benefit of the
members. If this is the case, however, the members must include in their
gross income their pro rata shares of taxable income of the association for
the year.
The concept of a common treasury or community treasury refers to the prop-
erty of such organizations as not being held by members individually, but
rather in a community capacity with all members having equal interests in
the property. This requirement is satisfied when all the income generated by
the community-operated business and from the property owned by the busi-
ness is placed into a community fund maintained by the organization and
used for the maintenance and support of its members.
This separate exemption exists because apostolic organizations weren’t
found to qualify for tax-exempt status under the general religious organiza-
tions exemption (primarily because of the presence of community activities
and private benefits). This exemption is rarely used by organizations.
Section 501(e): Hospitals
Section 501(e) provides an exemption for organizations that perform cooper-
ative services for hospitals. These organizations are required to be organized
and operated solely for two or more exempt hospitals and must be organized
and operated on a cooperative basis (meaning one member, one vote and
sharing in profits based on the amount of business done with the coopera-
tive, rather than on ownership interest). They generally perform services,
such as processing, billing, laboratory services, printing, and similar ser-
vices, for their members. (See Chapter 12 for more on cooperatives.)
77
Chapter 5: Getting Tax-Exempt Status

Section 501(f): Education
Section 501(f) provides the exemption for cooperative service organizations
that are operating educational organizations. These cooperative organiza-
tions are regarded as charitable organizations, which are organized and con-
trolled solely by members that are private or public educational institutions.
These organizations are organized and operated solely to hold, commingle,
and collectively invest and reinvest in stocks and securities contributed by
each member of the organization and to collect the income from these invest-
ments and turn it over to the members.
Section 501(k): Child care
Section 501(k) provides the exemption for child care organizations. The
exemption applies where substantially all of the care provided by the organi-
zation is for the purpose of enabling individuals to be gainfully employed.
The services provided by the organization must be available to the general
public. In other words, if a child care facility provides preference for the chil-
dren of employees of a specific employer, it doesn’t qualify for the exemption.
Section 501(n): Charitable risk pools
Section 501(n) provides an exemption for charitable risk pools, which are enti-
ties organized and operated solely to pool insurance risks of its members
(other than risks related to medical malpractice) and to provide its members
with information concerning loss control and risk management. All members
must be tax-exempt charitable organizations.
Section 521(a): Farmers’ co-ops
Section 521(a) provides an exemption to farmers’ cooperative associations.
Farmers’ cooperatives are associations of individuals that give their mem-
bers a place to market their products. These organizations are organized and
operated on a cooperative basis for the purpose of marketing the products of
members. They return the proceeds of sales less operating expenses to their
members on the basis of either the quantity or the value of the products fur-
nished by them, or for purchasing supplies for the use of members and turn-
ing over the supplies and equipment to the members at actual cost plus
expenses.
Section 527: Exempt political organizations
Internal Revenue Code Section 527 gives political organizations tax-exempt
status. A political organization is a party, committee, fund, or other organiza-
tion that’s organized and operated primarily to directly earn and directly
accept contributions or spend money for an exempt function. An exempt func-
tion is an activity that influences or attempts to influence the selection, nomi-
nation, election, or appointment of any individual to any public office or
office in a political organization.
78
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

The political action committee, or PAC, is the most recognized form of the
political organization.
Applying for Tax-Exempt Status
The application for tax-exempt status, which has to go to the IRS, is an 
arduous process. Unfortunately, no fast-track process exists to expedite the
review of your application. The best way to ensure that your application will
be processed quickly is to complete it as thoroughly as possible prior to
mailing it.
For example, all questions and line items to the application should be com-
pleted as clearly and fully as possible. Any attachments to the application
(such as bylaws or articles of organization) should be clearly marked and
identified and should show the organization’s name, address, and employer
identification number, along with a brief statement that it’s an attachment to
your application form. In the brief statement, you need to identify the part
and line number of the application form to which the attachment applies.
Even though there’s no fast track, there is a slow track, and you’ll be put on it
if your application is incomplete, missing attachments, incorrectly filed, or
requesting an exemption for which the application needs to be referred to
the exempt organizations’ examinations headquarters.
In the event that your application is incomplete, it will be returned to you, and
you’ll be notified that you can resubmit within a specific period of time — as
long as the proper information is provided.
If your organization appears to qualify for exemption under a section of
501(c) that’s different from the one for which it originally applied, a different
application form may be required. The IRS will advise you if this is the case,
and it will provide you with the appropriate form. At that point, you must
provide any additional necessary information required to complete the appli-
cation, and if a reply isn’t received within the time specified on the IRS’s com-
munications to you, your application will be processed only under the
section under which you originally applied.
Filling out the forms
In order to apply for tax-exempt status, most organizations use one of the
specific application forms provided by the IRS. These forms include the 
following:
79
Chapter 5: Getting Tax-Exempt Status

 Form 1023, which is titled Application for Recognition of Exemption
under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code
 Form 1024, which is titled Application for Recognition of Exemption
under Section 501(a)
These forms are available online (www.irs.gov), and they contain instruc-
tions and checklists to help you provide the information necessary for the
IRS to process the application.
If the form is properly completed and the IRS recognizes your organization’s
tax-exempt status, it will issue a determination letter, which is an official 
letter from the IRS addressed to the applicant organization which specifically
states that the organization has (or has not) met the requirements for a tax
exemption under the specific section of 501(c) the applicant applied for.
Determination letters won’t normally be given if an issue involving the organi-
zation’s exempt status is in litigation or is under consideration within the IRS.
Paying the fees
You know the common saying “Nothing in life is free,” right? Well, it applies to
the nonprofit world too. In other words, the application process for receiving
tax-exempt status isn’t free of charge. The law requires the payment of a user
fee to process the application. The fees are paid using IRS Form 8718. The
amount of the user fee depends on the type of application submitted, but in
2006 the fee ranged from $300 to $900.
Providing additional documents
In general, no matter what type of tax exemption is being applied for, certain
documents need to be submitted with the application. For example, every
exempt organization must have an employee identification number, whether
or not it has any employees. (Your organization can obtain its number by
submitting IRS Form SS-4, which is titled Application for Employer Identification
Number.)
You also need to include a copy of your organization’s articles of incorpora-
tion, trust indenture, or another enabling document. If no such document
exists, the organization won’t qualify for exempt status. If the organization
has bylaws, a current copy should also be included. (Check out Chapter 4 for
more on these documents.)
80
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

The application for exempt status should also contain a full description of
the purpose and activity of your organization, including any standards, pro-
cedures, or other criteria that the organization has adopted for carrying out
its purposes. The IRS also wants to know about the organization’s finances.
So you need to include financial statements showing receipts and expendi-
tures for the current year and the three previous years and a balance sheet
for the current year. If your organization is less than 1 year old or if it has not
yet begun operations, a proposed budget for two full accounting periods and
a current statement of assets and liabilities needs to be submitted. Beyond
these documents, the IRS may require additional information, such as copies
of advertising, publications, written materials, leases, contracts, or agreements.
The documents submitted with the application must be conformed copies,
meaning that the copies agree with the original documents and all amend-
ments. However, remember that original documents shouldn’t be submitted
because all documents submitted become part of the IRS’s file and can’t be
returned. Any attachments to a document must show the organization’s
name, address, and employee identification number.
An incomplete application may be returned without being considered. If sent
back, the IRS will state what additional information is required with the appli-
cation and the period of time you have to resubmit it. If you send the applica-
tion back in a timely fashion, it will be considered received on the original
submission date.
Understanding the approval process
If you’re still wondering what happens after your organization’s application is
submitted, you’ve come to the right place. This section explains just that.
Once a complete application is submitted, the application package will be
reviewed by an IRS manager in a department called Exempt Organizations
Determinations. This manager will either issue a favorable determination on
the organization’s exemption, issue an adverse determination denying the
exemption, or refer the case to the headquarters of the IRS for a ruling.
Referrals to headquarters are made when issues on qualification for exemp-
tion have no precedent or the issue is so unusual or complex that headquar-
ters consideration is justified. Although not widely publicized, a referral to
IRS headquarters will most likely substantially delay the issuance of any
determination.
After the IRS thoroughly reviews an application and makes a determination, a
ruling or determination letter is sent to the applicant. A ruling or a determination
letter is usually effective as of the date of the formation of the organization. If
81
Chapter 5: Getting Tax-Exempt Status

the IRS requires an organization to alter its activities or amend its charter in
order to qualify for a tax exemption, the ruling or determination letter is usu-
ally effective as of the date specified in the letter.
If an applicant has a change of heart, it may withdraw its application at any
time before the IRS issues a ruling or a determination letter, but the with-
drawal doesn’t prevent any of the information in the application from being
used by the IRS in any examination of the organization’s returns. Any informa-
tion an applicant submits with its application will not be returned, and any
user fee paid to the IRS will not be refunded.
After a completed application goes through and the applicant receives a deter-
mination letter, an organization’s application forms and annual information
returns are, by law, available for public inspection. The same law also requires
that the IRS allow public inspection of an approved application, including any
documents that the applicant may have submitted in support of it.
However, an applicant can make a request for withholding of information
from the public if any information submitted with its application relates to a
patent, a trade secret, or any other intellectual property (if the IRS deter-
mines that disclosure of the information would aversely affect the organiza-
tion). Such requests must specifically identify the material to be withheld
(which should be marked “Not Subject to Public Inspection”), must include
the reasons that the information should be withheld, and must be filed with
the documents containing the material requested to be withheld.
As a final note, any ruling or determination letter recognizing a tax exemption
can’t be relied on if there’s a material change in the character, purpose, or
method of operation of your organization that’s inconsistent with the exemp-
tion initially provided.
Applying if your organization 
hasn’t begun operating
If you want to apply for tax-exempt status even though your organization isn’t
up and running yet, you just have to be sure and describe your organization’s
proposed operations in enough detail to permit the IRS to conclude that your
organization clearly meets the particular requirements of the section of the
Internal Revenue Code under which you’re claiming an exemption (see the
section “Skimming Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)” earlier in this chap-
ter for a list of the most common exemption sections).
82
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

In other words, a statement of your organization’s purpose isn’t enough to
satisfy this requirement. You must be able to describe the following in detail:
 The procedures, standards, or other activities adopted or planned for
carrying out your organization’s activities
 The expected sources of funds
 The anticipated expenses
If you fail to furnish a sufficiently detailed description of proposed activities
and financing, the IRS may turn you down by issuing an adverse ruling or
determination letter. You have a right to appeal this decision. (Flip to the sec-
tion “Appealing an Adverse Determination with the IRS” later in this chapter
for more.)
Getting a determination
If you get approved for tax-exempt status, the status will likely be legally
effective as of the date of the formation of your organization. Assuming that
your organization has filed and paid taxes prior to receiving the recognition,
you may file for a refund of any taxes paid for the period for which the exempt
status is recognized.
Suppose the IRS contacts you and says prior to issuing a determination letter
or ruling recognizing your organization’s exempt status, you will be required
to alter your activities or substantially amend your charter. In that case, the
ruling or determination letter ultimately issued to recognize your tax exemp-
tion will become effective as of the date specified in the letter or ruling.
Appealing an Adverse Determination
with the IRS
If the IRS turns down your organization for tax-exempt status, you’ll get a
letter that includes information about your right to protest this determina-
tion by requesting an Appeals Office consideration. To follow up on the
appeal, you must send your protest to the manager of the office that issued
the adverse letter. You must do this within 30 days from the date of the
adverse letter, and you must state that you want to have an Appeals Office
conference.
83
Chapter 5: Getting Tax-Exempt Status

Your organization can be represented by a principal officer or trustee at any
level of appeal within the IRS, or it may be represented by an attorney, a certi-
fied public accountant (CPA), or any other individual enrolled to practice
before the IRS.
In order to represent an organization, a representative needs to have a power
of attorney authorizing such representation on file with the IRS. 
Doing the paperwork
In filing a protest to the local Appeals Office, you must include the following
information:
 Identifying information: The organization’s name, address, and
employer identification number.
 Statement of protest: A statement that the organization wants to protest
the determination.
 Date of denial: The date and any code that the IRS asks you to include
with correspondence (which will be noted on the determination letter).
 The facts: A statement of the facts that support your organization’s posi-
tion, and any contested factual issues.
 Legal position: A statement that outlines the law of authority that you’ll
be relying on.
 Request for a conference: A statement acknowledging that you want to
have a conference at the Appeals Office.
After considering the organization’s protest and any information presented in
the conference, the Appeals Office will notify your organization of its decision
and will issue an appropriate determination letter. You may then appeal any
adverse decision to the courts (this process is explained in the following 
section).
Taking it to court: An exhausting process
Before an unfavorable ruling or determination letter from the IRS can be
appealed to the courts, your organization needs to exhaust its administrative
remedies to ensure that all possible steps have been taken before resorting
to court action. These remedies include:
84
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

 A filing of the substantially completed application form (in the event
that any information was missing)
 In the case of a later filed application, a request for extension of time for
making an election or application for relief from tax
 The timely submission of all additional information requested
 The exhaustion of all administrative appeals to the IRS
After you’ve exhausted the administrative remedies, you can appeal to a U.S.
District Court or the U.S. Court of Federal Claims if your organization was
forced to pay taxes because of the unfavorable determination (but it other-
wise met all other statutory prerequisites). You can also file a suit for redeter-
mination of tax deficiencies in the U.S. Tax Court. Deciding which court to
appeal to is complicated, and you’ll need to talk to a good tax lawyer before
deciding what to do at this point.
If your organization received an adverse determination, or if the IRS failed to
make a timely determination on your qualification as an exempt organization
under Section 501(c)(3), you can file suit for a declaratory judgment in the
U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the U.S. District Court of
Federal Claims, or the U.S. Tax Court.
A court determination can take years to complete, and your organization is
well-advised to continue filing the proper tax forms during the suit.
If a suit results in a final determination that recognizes the tax-exempt status
of your organization, the IRS will issue a favorable ruling or determination
letter, provided that your organization has filed an application for exemption
and submitted a statement that the facts and law are the same as in the
period considered by the court.

Paying Nonprofit Directors,
Officers, Staff, and Volunteers
In This Chapter
 Forming a compensation committee
 Understanding the IRS guidelines
 Determining reasonable compensation packages
 Accounting properly for payments made to volunteers
O
ne of the most sensitive issues for any nonprofit organization is how
much to pay its officers, directors, and staff. If salaries aren’t in line with
the marketplace, it’s difficult to attract competent, talented people to serve
in key positions. However, if salaries for officers and directors are set to be
competitive with for-profit companies, these amounts run the risk of appear-
ing excessive to the constituency who wants to see more funds spent on pro-
grams. Setting salaries is far from an exact science, and in recent years the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has found it necessary to add its opinion into
the mix as to what should be considered “reasonable.”
In this chapter, we take a close look at how nonprofits set income for their
top officers, what limits the IRS imposes on setting income, and what benefits
it considers to be counted as income.
Convening a Compensation Committee
When a board finds a particular task to be sticky, time-consuming, or contro-
versial, it may opt to delegate the matter to a committee (see Chapter 9 for
more details on committees). Compensation committees are a case in point.
Generally boards try to put board members on the compensation committees
who have some sort of relevant expertise in evaluating skills sets and setting
compensation.

When they establish compensation committees, many nonprofits assign the
following duties to it:
 Researching appropriate initial salaries for new positions: These
determinations may be based on market surveys and on analysis of the
nonprofit organization’s recruiting needs.
 Evaluating the performance of senior management and staff: This is
an ancillary duty to setting compensation. The committee’s role may be
simply to compile performance evaluation data from other board mem-
bers and staff, and then link it to a compensation recommendation in
some meaningful way.
 Recommending salary levels and adjustments, usually on an annual
basis: Recommendations should include the research and analysis that
the committee used in making its decision, such as salary surveys and
advice from trained consultants with backgrounds in personnel and
human resources management. These people are sometimes referred to
as compensation consultants.
Setting the officers’ salaries
It’s rare to find someone who thinks that he or she is overpaid, and in the
nonprofit arena, salaries of top executives are constantly under scrutiny.
Every nonprofit needs to strive toward balance and fairness when setting
executive compensation.
A nonprofit organization can have a number of different officer positions,
including a chief executive officer or president, an executive director, a vice-
president, a secretary, and a treasurer. Generally, an officer is any person who
has a position of trust or authority within an organization. Determining their
compensation raises sensitive issues because of their assumed position of
influence within the organization. Accordingly, officers of a nonprofit organi-
zation shouldn’t serve on the compensation committee.
Although corporate officers are generally employees, not all are. Officers who
don’t perform any services or receive salaries aren’t considered employees
for insurance and other purposes.
With support staff, such as secretaries and receptionists, it’s pretty easy to
set salaries based on the market rate. That’s because the going rates for
these types of services within a specific geographic area can easily be
assessed by looking at what others are paying. However, setting the salary for
top-level officers poses more of a challenge for the following reasons:
88
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

 Difficulty in getting comparable data: Because an organization gener-
ally has only one president, and every organization is different, there
may not be a lot of comparable data available.
 Uniqueness of each organization: The type of individual it takes to run
a nonprofit differs from organization to organization. Some nonprofits
may need a leader with fundraising skills, while others require someone
with political savvy, administrative skills, technical expertise, industry
reputation, or some other characteristic that the board considers essen-
tial to the future success of the organization.
 Concerns about competitive recruiting: For-profit corporations gener-
ally look for people with similar skill sets, and they often compete for
the person who may be considered a qualified candidate by either a
nonprofit or a for-profit entity. However, nonprofits have the advantage
of attracting candidates with altruistic motives who aren’t influenced by
salary alone, but who are motivated by humanitarian or other reasons.
 The organization’s ability to pay: Overriding nearly every other consid-
eration is setting compensation in line with the organization’s ability to
pay. The resources of a nonprofit organization can vary dramatically
from year to year, and some organizations operate on a shoestring
budget over the long term. So, the realities of the organization’s financial
resources must be considered. In addition, because an officer’s pay is
made public through the filing of Form 990 (which lists compensation
information), the amount must be supportable by the nonprofit’s 
constituency.
Comparing salaries paid 
at other nonprofits
Compensation committees are constantly faced with the problem of trying to
make apples-to-apples–type comparisons. Nonprofits vary widely in their
sizes and missions, and due to this variety, they often don’t have objective
measurable standards of comparison (like earnings, as would be the cases
with their for-profit counterparts). Because of the specialized nature of non-
profit compensation, committees are more likely to be stuck with an apples-
to-oranges–type of comparison. Some of the factors that nonprofits might
look at to determine whether other organizations are comparable to theirs
for purposes of determining salaries may include the following:
 Similar size of budgets: The overall budget of an organization is a good
indicator of its complexity to manage and administer.
 Organizational revenue: How much revenue an organization generates
in the form of donations or earned income is an objective yardstick for
comparing organizations.
89
Chapter 6: Paying Nonprofit Directors, Officers, Staff, and Volunteers

 Number of employees: Arguably, the more people an organization has,
the more personnel issues there are to manage. So, higher salaries are
justified for those who do the managing.
 Similarity of mission: This is a more subjective standard, but it can be
useful. For example, if your organization is a preschool, you could com-
pare it to other early childhood programs (as opposed to chambers of
commerce or rotary clubs).
 Geographic location: Wages differ dramatically by geographical region,
and this is a comparative standard that shouldn’t be overlooked. Wages
are (and rightfully should be) higher in New York City than in Arkansas,
no matter what the position is.
A lot of information about comparable nonprofits can be found in their most
recent Form 990 (see Chapter 7). Form 990s are publicly available for review
by going to www.guidestar.org, which is discussed in more detail in
Chapter 7. If it’s clear that such data isn’t available or is nonexistent, for-
profit comparables can be used. But remember that they may be subject to
adjustment because of their for-profit nature.
The buck stops with the board
A nonprofit board is ultimately responsible for major financial decisions, but
it can delegate the task of setting salaries to a compensation committee. It
can also delegate decisions about the hiring of an executive, about evaluating
performance, and about formulating the executive’s compensation packages.
However, this doesn’t insulate the organization from liability. Ultimately, the
responsibility for all decisions always remains with the entire board. Delega-
tion doesn’t absolve them from their responsibility for oversight of compen-
sation decisions.
For example, a common trap that compensation committees can fall into is to
accept recommendations from the executive as to what his or her compensa-
tion should be, or hire a compensation consultant referred by the executive.
These considerations may seem harmless enough, but they nonetheless have
the potential to directly or indirectly slant the view of the board and taint the
entire compensation decision-making process.
After the compensation committee formulates its recommendations, the
entire board must participate in the decision-making process, have a com-
mand of the full details of the compensation package, and have the opportu-
nity to discuss and approve the package.
90
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

Following IRS Guidelines
One may wonder why the IRS would want to be involved in determining what
nonprofits pay their workers. The simple answer is that the IRS has an inter-
est in making sure that nonprofit organizations aren’t used to the advantage
of private individuals. In other words, it wants to make sure that nonprofits
aren’t abused. For example, siphoning off large salaries to cronies who per-
form no real services for the organization is one way nonprofits could be
used to further private interests.
The IRS offers guidelines on what’s considered reasonable compensation, and
it has the authority to revoke the exempt status of tax-exempt organizations
that ignore them. According to the IRS, if a nonprofit organization meets the
following requirements, its officers’ compensation arrangement is presumed
to be reasonable:
 Advance approval: The IRS frowns on arrangements that are made with-
out full disclosure to the board of directors. The compensation arrange-
ment must be approved by the full board (not just the compensation
committee or a compensation consultant) in advance of paying it.
 Authorization by independent individuals: The compensation arrange-
ment must be authorized and approved by individuals who are indepen-
dent and who don’t have a conflict of interest concerning the pay. For
example, a compensation committee consisting of some members of the
board is considered independent as long as none of the members has a
substantial relationship with the individual whose compensation is
being set.
Independence minimizes the possibility of undue influence or considera-
tion of factors that wouldn’t normally carry weight with persons who are
independent from the organization and the person being considered.
 Documented data: The IRS doesn’t want nonprofit organizations pulling
numbers out of a hat, even if the compensation arrangements are preap-
proved completely by independent individuals. The nonprofit must be
ready to show that the compensation amount is based on actual data of
comparable salaries.
Determining what’s “reasonable”
Reasonable compensation is a term that can be difficult to pin down. In fact, it
can be pretty subjective, and compensation committees can vary widely in
what they view as reasonable. The IRS defines reasonable compensation as
91
Chapter 6: Paying Nonprofit Directors, Officers, Staff, and Volunteers

the amount that would ordinarily be paid for like services by like enterprises
(whether taxable or tax exempt) under like circumstances. Some of the fac-
tors that the IRS looks at in determining what’s reasonable include the 
following:
 Amounts paid for similar services: This can include amounts paid in
both the nonprofit and for-profit sectors, because the focus is on the
actual services and skill set of the organization.
 Similarity of organizations: The work of some organizations may be
more challenging than others. The IRS figures that it’s helpful to look at
the type of organization when deciding how much to pay the people who
work for it.
 Actual duties and responsibilities of the executives: This involves com-
paring duties and responsibilities, not titles. For example, the salary of
an executive who’s involved in major decisions and formulating long-
term business plans isn’t comparable to that of an executive with the
same title who’s charged with administrative duties and implements
strategies designed by others.
 Similar for-profits: Where no appropriate nonprofits are available, for-
profit comparables can be used. IRS regulations do allow comparisons
to nonprofit or for-profit entities, or both. Ideally comparisons are made
against entities of similar size, budget, revenue, number of employees,
industry, and geographic location. However, comparing against a for-
profit organization doesn’t allow a rebuttable presumption of reason-
ableness, and it will likely draw increased scrutiny from the IRS.
Documenting the decision 
process in the minutes
All compensation committees should “paper its trails to cover its tail.” In
other words, document everything carefully. Detailed minutes of what’s dis-
cussed at compensation committee meetings and how all the issues are
resolved can go a long way in avoiding future charges of favoritism or arbi-
trariness. This is true for both large nonprofits, as well as smaller community-
based organizations, because salaries are often a significant portion of an
organization’s budget.
In fact, IRS regulations specify that a compensation committee must ade-
quately and in a timely manner document the basis for its determination 
concurrently while making its determination. You want to avoid having to
reconstruct what a committee did weeks, months, or even years later. One
92
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

way to make sure your organization meets this requirement is to have the
compensation committee keep minutes of its meetings. The minutes should
include the following items:
 Attendees: The minutes should include a list of attendees, their titles or
roles, and how they voted on the issues that were discussed.
 Consideration of conflicts: Potential conflicts of interest of any mem-
bers of the compensation committee should be completely aired and
fully discussed, and these discussions should be documented in detail.
 The date the compensation package was approved: Dates of approval
are important because the IRS guidelines require preapproval, not post-
approval, of compensation packages.
 Due diligence: Minutes should also reflect that the committee took the
time and trouble to obtain and review the necessary data about compa-
rable salaries. The comparability data that was obtained and relied on
should either be referenced and available for later review, or included
with the minutes themselves.
 Terms of the compensation package: It’s important to document that all
of the costs of the compensation package were considered and specifi-
cally approved.
A compensation committee that follows these guidelines will be presumed 
to have acted reasonably in setting an officer’s compensation. The IRS can
refute this presumption of reasonableness only by developing sufficient con-
trary evidence to rebut the data that the committee relied on.
If the committee doesn’t satisfy the previous IRS guidelines, the IRS will look
at the particular facts and circumstances to determine whether the compen-
sation is reasonable.
Cooking Up a Compensation Package
What’s included in a compensation package? The IRS stresses the importance
of including all forms of compensation. In other words, IRS regulations are
very specific about what items can and can’t be excluded from income.
Problem areas that frequently crop up include the following:
 Expense reimbursements
 Gifts and gift certificates
 Personal use of employer-owned property
93
Chapter 6: Paying Nonprofit Directors, Officers, Staff, and Volunteers

 Spousal travel expenses
 Club memberships
 Personal components of business travel
Unless a specific exemption applies, each of these components needs to be
added into any employee’s income whether or not they’re treated as income
for income tax purposes.
Identifying the additional ingredients 
of a compensation package
The following types of compensation are acceptable for organizations to pay,
but they must be reported as compensation:
 Non-cash items: Any and all forms of cash and non-cash compensation,
including salaries, bonuses, severance payments, and deferred 
compensation.
 Insurance premiums: Payments for liability insurance premiums, or the
payment of taxes or certain expenses.
 Other benefits: All other benefits that are meant as compensation,
whether or not they might be included in gross income for income tax
purposes.
 Fringe benefits: Most taxable and nontaxable fringe benefits.
 Interest-free loans: Foregone loan interest.
Putting the compensation recipe in writing
A financial benefit to an officer won’t be considered part of his paycheck
unless the organization providing the benefit clearly indicates that it intends
to treat the payment as part of the compensation package. For example, the
organization has a choice as to whether to treat expenses like mileage, profes-
sional education, laptop computers, and frequent flyer miles as compensation.
Generally, an organization will treat the items that seem to elude classifica-
tion as compensation. It does this to avoid having a situation with the IRS
where the officer or employee ends up owing unexpected income taxes. This
practice helps protect the IRS from later coming in and reclassifying the item
as income and requiring the officer to amend his or her tax return, as well as
assess penalties on the nonprofit.
94
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 

Your organization can easily document in writing which perks it intends to
include as compensation, and which are reimbursed expenses that don’t
count as earnings. A few ways you can do this include the following:
 Having a written agreement: Having a signed contract (usually an
employment contract) is a simple way to clear up any confusion.
 Reporting the item as wages: Let the officer know that it’s compensa-
tion by reporting the benefit as compensation on his or her Form W-2.
 Using IRS Form 1099: When the person being compensated isn’t consid-
ered an employee, but he or she serves the organization in some other
capacity (such as an independent contractor or a consultant), the report
can be made on a Form 1099 (as opposed to a W-2, which is generally
used for employees).
 Reporting IRS Form 990: Listing the officers’ compensation on the orga-
nization’s annual Form 990 tax return informs the IRS of what the com-
pensation level is.
 Telling the officer or employee to report it: Having the officer report
the benefit as income on his or her individual income tax return (in
cases where it isn’t already listed on a W-2 or 1099) is another way to
document how the item is to be treated. Of course, it may be difficult for
your organization to know if this has been done, because it isn’t privy to
the tax returns of the people working for the organization.
Looking at the consequences of paying
unreasonable compensation
Up to this point in the chapter, we’ve discussed how reasonable compensa-
tion is established. But what happens when the IRS determines that compen-
sation is unreasonable because it doesn’t meet the foregoing standards? Bad
things. Really bad things.
The IRS imposes severe sanctions on persons of influence (officers and direc-
tors) who receive excessive economic benefits from a nonprofit organization.
The person is the target here; the nonprofit organization itself isn’t usually
punished — unless of course, the indiscretion is so flagrant that a revocation
of the organization’s tax-exempt status is warranted.
Okay, so what’s unreasonable? The IRS has determined that under certain 
circumstances, the following items can be considered unreasonable 
compensation:
95
Chapter 6: Paying Nonprofit Directors, Officers, Staff, and Volunteers

 Leasing of property owned by an executive to the nonprofit in return for
excessive rent
 Loans made by a nonprofit to an executive
 Payment by the nonprofit of expenses for a for-profit corporation owned
by the executive
 Payment by the nonprofit of personal expenses of members of an execu-
tive’s family
 Personal use of vehicles (for example, airplanes)
 Receipt of royalties from a book published by the nonprofit organization
 Reimbursements of personal expenses
The IRS labels all of these transactions as excess benefit transactions. An
excess benefit transaction is one where an economic benefit is provided by a
nonprofit to an executive, where the value of that benefit exceeds the value
received by the nonprofit for the benefit from the executive. Or, to be blunt,
an excess benefit transaction is when the IRS believes that the executive’s
effort is being substantially overvalued.
96
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 
The sting of the Pension Protection Act
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) not
only doubles the excise tax on excess benefit
transactions, but it also creates new rules that
apply to situations where no abuse may be pre-
sent. One such situation applies to nonprofit
organizations that are classified as donor-
advised funds. Where a nonprofit donor-advised
fund pays compensation to a donor or someone
related to the donor who advises the fund, that
payment is automatically considered an excess
benefit transaction. The entire amount of com-
pensation will be treated as an excess benefit,
regardless of the value of the service rendered.
For example, under this automatic excess ben-
efit transaction rule, even though a donor’s family
member may provide reasonable necessary 
personal services that are necessary to accom-
plish the nonprofit’s mission to a donor-advised
fund, the entire amount of compensation paid to
the donor’s family member can still be consid-
ered an excess benefit transaction. This subjects
the unsuspecting family member to excise taxes.
Similarly, expense reimbursements to any family
member of a donor (even if related to the bene-
fit of the nonprofit) will be considered an auto-
matic excess benefit transaction. The PPA’s
penalty provisions impose much stricter rules
on donor-advised funds than on private founda-
tions. Of particular importance, however, is that
a donor, as well as his or her family members
and related parties, are now subject to the
excise tax penalties.

The IRS makes sure that excess benefit transactions are costly and something
to be avoided by imposing the following penalties:
 Initial 25-percent penalty: The IRS will send the executive a bill equal to
25 percent of the excess benefit for each excess benefit transaction.
 A 200-percent penalty for those who persist: If the excess benefit trans-
action isn’t corrected within a given time period, an additional excise tax
equal to a 200-percent penalty may be imposed. Ouch!
 Doubling the pain under the Pension Protection Act of 2006: To make
matters even more serious, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 doubles
(yes, doubles) the penalties applicable to excess benefit transactions.
For more on the Pension Protection Act, see the sidebar, “The sting of
the Pension Protection Act.”
Governance Issues and Compensation
In this day and age, issues of executive compensation and governance are
closely intertwined. We have a Sarbanes-Oxley mindset to thank for this.
(Sarbanes-Oxley and its relationship to nonprofit organizations is discussed
in Chapter 13.)
97
Chapter 6: Paying Nonprofit Directors, Officers, Staff, and Volunteers
IRS compliance checks
The IRS has a special division for reviewing
issues relating to executive compensation. This
division is known as the Exempt Organizations
branch of the Tax Exempt/Government Entities
Division, or TE/GE Division (as discussed in
Chapter 15).
The TE/GE Division has taken an active role in the
past when it comes to executive compensation
of exempt organizations. In 2004, it announced a
new enforcement effort to curb abuses by
exempt organizations. The agency contacted
over 1,800 public charities and private founda-
tions to request compensation practice informa-
tion. The TE/GE announced that the goal of the
contacts was to learn how exempt organizations
determine and report compensation, and to raise
awareness of compensation-related tax issues
and questionable practices.
About 1,200 of the initial 1,800 contacts were
considered compliance checks. A compliance
check is an IRS review to determine whether an
organization is following proper record-keeping
and reporting procedures; it isn’t an audit.
Compliance checks are intended to alert an
organization to potential errors. The 2004 com-
pliance checks were mostly triggered by some
sort of error on the organization’s Form 990s,
such as a question being incorrectly answered
or omitted entirely. The most common types of
information omitted included information related
to loans, deferred compensation, and fringe
benefits.

The IRS is always concerned as to whether governing boards of nonprofit
organizations exercise a sufficient degree of due diligence in setting the com-
pensation for leaders of their organizations. The media seems to delight in
reporting on executives of both private foundations and public charities who
are receiving what many consider to be unreasonably large compensation
packages.
Identifying best practices
When talking compensation, the IRS believes that exempt organizations
should focus on four key governance areas:
 Creating legal structures: Every board should strive to set compensa-
tion in advance by disinterested board members on the basis of appro-
priate comparability data.
 Reporting all the benefits: This means timely reporting of all economic
benefits to officers, directors, and key employees on IRS Form 990
(check out Chapter 7 for more info on this form).
 Being timely: Organizations should take care to report the benefits in
the time period that they’re paid.
 Staying accountable: Boards that delegate compensation issues to com-
mittees still have the ultimate responsibility over the compensation
decision.
 Avoiding payments to private individuals: The Internal Revenue Code
says that the assets of an organization can’t be diverted for the benefit
of private individuals. If an organization pays or distributes assets to
insiders in excess of the fair market value of the services rendered, it’s
running afoul of this rule, and the organization can lose its tax-exempt
status.
98
Part II: The Nuts and Bolts of Nonprofits 
Steering clear of excise taxes
Insiders of public charities and of private foun-
dations are subject to excise taxes on any over-
payments that they receive from the entities.
Although an overpayment to an insider of a public
charity could result in a revocation of tax-exempt
status, the Internal Revenue Code provides an
intermediate sanction that ameliorates that
result in many cases. Under the intermediate
sanction rules, an excise tax can be imposed on
the insider who received the overpayment and
on certain managers who knowingly approved
the overpayment.

Exempt organizations are generally safe if they develop and follow proce-
dures for setting compensation and if they make honest, responsible efforts
in line with their size and revenues to determine what the appropriate level
of compensation is.
Weighing all the factors
At the risk of beating a dead horse, it bears repeating that neither a public
charity nor a private foundation can pay more than reasonable compensation
without running afoul of IRS issues. And reasonable compensation is deter-
mined by weighing all facts and circumstances, considering the market value of
the services performed. Generally speaking, reasonable compensation is mea-
sured with reference to the amount that would ordinarily be paid for compara-
ble services by comparable enterprises under comparable circumstances.
Avoiding Tax for Volunteers
Volunteers are the lifeblood of many organizations. They come in all shapes
and sizes, and serve in all manner of capacities.
Many nonprofits have volunteer officers who aren’t paid for their services.
However, these officers can get reimbursed or receive an allowance for the
out-of-pocket expenses that are incurred in connection with their volunteer
service. These reimbursements can have tax consequences. For example, if
an officer is required to attend a conference to represent the nonprofit, the
organization may foot the bill for the trip. Just how an officer’s reimburse-
ment or allowance is paid and accounted for will determine how it will be
treated for employment tax purposes.
Generally, reimbursement payments to volunteers are made in two ways:
accountable plans and non-accountable plans, both of which are described
the following sections.
Keeping track with an accountable plan
An accountable plan is one where all the funds are tracked and business
expenses don’t have to be reported on the volunteer’s income tax return. An
accountable plan has the following characteristics:
99
Chapter 6: Paying Nonprofit Directors, Officers, Staff, and Volunteers

 Relationship: There’s a “business” connection between the expense
paid and the mission or operations of the organization.
 Accounting: The volunteer adequately accounts for the expenses within
a reasonable period of time.
 Return of funds not used for expenses: Under an accountable plan, a
volunteer must return any excess expenses to the organization within a
reasonable period of time.
If any one of the above three conditions isn’t met, the plan will be considered
a non-accountable plan (see the section “Opting for a non-accountable plan”
for more).
Payments made under an accountable plan don’t need to be reported on a
Form W-2.
Opting for a non-accountable plan
Under a non-accountable plan, reimbursements are includable as gross income,
and they’re required to be reported on a Form W-2. They’re also subject to
employment taxes. Because employment taxes must be paid, W-2’s must be
issued. This option requires a nonprofit organization to keep careful records.
Employment taxes are a liability imposed on an employer by both state and
federal law, and failure to report and pay them can result in fines and penal-
ties to the organization.

 Viewing some sample forms
A
fter getting tax-exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), did
you think that your organization was home free and would never have to
file another revenue form? Well, no such luck. The IRS may not want a tax pay-
ment from your organization every year, but it does want information — and
lots of it. And it all has to be painfully extracted and meticulously organized on
the IRS’s very own Form 990.
To get you acquainted with this important form, this chapter explains which
organizations are required to file Form 990, what kinds of information the IRS
is after, and what happens to negligent nonprofits that attempt to skirt their
obligations. This chapter also offers tips for legally snooping into other non-
profits’ affairs by accessing their Form 990s.
Introducing Form 990: What 
It Is and Who Has to File It
Not every tax form requires a payment of tax. Sometimes information is what
the IRS is after. For example, Forms 990, 990-EZ, and 990-PF (the three, um,
forms of Form 990) are considered information returns or reporting forms. The
public uses the information on these returns to evaluate nonprofits and how

they operate. On these forms, you can see what a nonprofit’s income and
expenses are, how much it pays its key people, and other useful information
that can help you assess what a nonprofit does.
Form 990 is a fairly critical form for the public disclosure of information,
because the law doesn’t require typical annual reports from nonprofit organi-
zations. Even financial audits by independent accountants aren’t required by
law (except in special circumstances).
The organizations that must file the Form 990s don’t have to pay federal
income tax on income that’s related to their exempt purposes and programs.
However, many private foundations do have to pay an excise tax that’s based
on their investment income.
After an organization files its completed Form 990 or Form 990-EZ, it’s avail-
able for the world to see. This public access is required under Section 6104 of
the Internal Revenue Code. (See the section “Researching Form 990s Online”
later in the chapter for details on the best ways to snoop around in other
nonprofit organizations’ forms.) Form 990-PF (for private foundations) must
also be made available for public inspection by the private foundation, but
that usually requires an appointment and a trip down to the foundation’s
main office.
Some nonprofits have income that isn’t related to their exempt purpose. This
so-called unrelated business income is reported on Form 990-T, which is dis-
cussed in more detail in the section “Monitoring unrelated business income
with the Form 990-T” later in the chapter. (Check out Chapter 14 for more on
unrelated business income.)
Organizations that must 
file a 990 without fail
The IRS wants to know about some groups every year. These groups include
the following:
 Private foundations: Every private foundation must file a Form 990-PF,
regardless of its size.
 Larger nonprofits: Most nonprofits that have incomes of more than
$25,000 generally have to file either Form 990 or 990-EZ.
 Everyone else: Organizations that are tax-exempt under Sections 501(c),
527, or 4947(a)(1) of the U.S. tax code and that don’t fall into the exemp-
tions listed in the next section (“Organizations that don’t have to file a
990”) must file a 990 or 990-EZ every year without fail.
104
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 

Organizations that don’t have to file a 990
Some organizations are exempt from filing any of the Form 990s. If your orga-
nization is fortunate enough to be exempt from filing these forms, after glanc-
ing through this section, you can safely skip the rest of this chapter — unless,
of course, you want to find out how to snoop into the affairs of other organi-
zations using these forms. If that’s the case, skip to the section “Researching
Form 990s Online” later in this chapter.
To be sure that your organization is exempt, check out the following list of
exempt entities:
 Small nonprofits: Organizations with annual incomes of $25,000 or 
less get a free ride, probably because the IRS itself has staffing and 
cost constraints.
 Faith-based organizations: Just about all faith-based organizations get
to skip filing Form 990, regardless of size. Hallelujah!
 Subsidiaries of other nonprofits: The IRS believes in nepotism! Any sub-
sidiary organization whose parent organization or national headquarters
filed a 990 for the entire organization gets to skip the formalities.
 Nonprofits that aren’t in the system yet: Nonprofits that haven’t applied
to the IRS for exemption from federal income tax don’t have to file a
Form 990 because the IRS wouldn’t even know who the form is from.
 Religious schools: A school below college level that’s affiliated with a
church or operated by a religious order doesn’t have any Form 990
homework.
 Missions and missionary organizations: This category includes a mis-
sion society sponsored by or affiliated with one or more churches or
church organizations, if more than half of the society’s activities are con-
ducted in or directed at persons in foreign countries.
 State institutions: A state institution that gets a free tax ride because 
it provides essential government services (a university for example)
doesn’t have to file a Form 990.
 Government corporations: A corporation organized under an act of
Congress that’s an “instrumentality of the United States” doesn’t have to
file a Form 990 because it’s an arm of the government and is exempt
from federal income taxes under 501(c)(1).
105
Chapter 7: Filing the Dreaded Form 990

Filing deadlines and extensions
The filing deadline for Form 990, 990-EZ, or 990-PF is “the 15th day of the 5th
month after [an] organization’s accounting period ends,” according to the
IRS. So, if a nonprofit’s fiscal year ends on December 31, its 990 will be due on
May 15 of the following year.
A nonprofit can get an automatic three-month extension by submitting Form
8868 to the IRS. The organization often can get another three-month exten-
sion by submitting a second Form 8868 — if it has an acceptable reason
(known as good cause) for requesting the extension. (Examples of good 
cause would be an illness or a hurricane.)
Figuring Out Which Form to File
Form 990 comes in many flavors, including the 990, 990-EZ, 990-PF, and 990-T.
Each is discussed in the following sections. Generally, the type of form you
file depends on the type of organization for which you’re filing.
Form 990 versus 990-EZ
Because the public relies on Form 990 and Form 990-EZ as the primary or
sole source of information, the IRS is a stickler for the specific details required
on the forms (see the section “Researching Form 990s Online” later in this
chapter for more info on how the public uses the information from 990s).
Both Form 990 and Form 990-EZ are used by tax-exempt organizations, nonex-
empt charitable trusts, and certain types of exempt political organizations to
provide the IRS with annual reports of their activities and income.
Organizations with gross receipts of less than $100,000 and total assets of
less than $250,000 at the end of the year can file a 990-EZ, which is the short
form. However, if an organization that meets these earnings wants to file the
long Form 990, the IRS is more than happy to let it do so.
In fact, some organizations that aren’t required to file anything with the IRS
may actually want to file a Form 990-EZ. (Check out the section “Organizations
that don’t have to file a 990” earlier in the chapter for details on those organi-
zations that are exempt from filing the forms.)
106
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 

So why would these organizations go to all the work and bother of filing a
form that the feds don’t even require? One likely answer is that they may
want to use it to satisfy state reporting requirements, as discussed in the sec-
tion “Satisfying the States with Form 990” later in this chapter.
If an organization chooses to file a Form 990 or 990-EZ even though it isn’t
required to file one, it still must attach all the schedules and statements that
are required to be filed with the form. Otherwise, the return may not be
accepted by the IRS.
A private matter: The 990-PF
All private foundations file Form 990-PF annually, regardless of whether they
have any assets or annual receipts. These private organizations include the
following:
 Exempt private foundations
 Taxable private foundations
 Organizations whose applications for exempt status are pending on the
due date for filing the Form 990-PF
 Organizations that are qualified for basic research
 Organizations that are terminating their private foundation status
 Certain nonexempt charitable trusts that are treated as private 
foundations
As with Forms 990 and 990-EZ, some states will accept a copy of Form 990-PF
and its required attachments instead of all or part of their own financial
report forms. The discussion in the later section “Satisfying the States with
Form 990” applies equally to Form 990-PF.
Monitoring unrelated business 
income with the Form 990-T
If an organization earns income that’s unrelated to its nonprofit missions, the
government imposes taxes on that income. This income is called unrelated
business income (see Chapter 14). If Congress didn’t levy this tax, commercial
businesses would be at a huge competitive disadvantage with nonprofit orga-
nizations because the nonprofits would get to compete tax-free. To remove
the competitive disadvantage, the government says that if an organization
107
Chapter 7: Filing the Dreaded Form 990

has enough unrelated trade or business income, the organization could lose
its tax-exempt status altogether.
So, if a nonprofit has unrelated business income of $1,000 or more, it’s
required to file IRS Form 990-T. This form is in addition to the Form 990, 990-
EZ, or 990-PF. The filing date for the form varies depending on the type of
organization.
In order for income to be considered unrelated, which is a classification that
would require a Form 990-T, the following three factors must be present:
 The nonprofit organization conducts a trade or business
 The trade or business isn’t substantially related to the nonprofit pur-
pose of the organization
 The trade or business is regularly carried on by the nonprofit organiza-
tion (in other words, the IRS won’t come down too hard on the isolated
sale of a plate of cookies or the sale of an old church organ)
Satisfying the States with Form 990
Prior to the 1980s, most states required a separate report (separate from the
IRS’s Form 990) to be filed with state charities regulation offices. Unfortunately,
these states all used different forms with wildly different formats to obtain simi-
lar information. This inconsistency meant an awful lot of work for charities
operating in several states.
State charities regulators and representatives from the nonprofits all advo-
cated for changes to IRS Form 990 so that states would accept it in lieu of
their own information returns.
Today, some states graciously accept a copy of the IRS’s Form 990 or Form
990-EZ in place of their own version of the form, which serves as the basic
annual report to over 35 state charities offices.
Scoping out state statutes
To figure out if a Form 990 or a Form 990-EZ is required in a particular state,
you need to check its laws. This check is easily accomplished by reviewing
the Web site for the state’s department of revenue. Generally, your organiza-
tion is required to meet the reporting requirements of any state in which it
does the following:
108
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 

 Solicits contributions: If your organization solicits grants or contribu-
tions from individuals, businesses, or other charitable organizations, it
generally must meet the reporting requirements of that state.
 Conducts programs: If your organization has employees in a state, it
generally must file with that jurisdiction.
 Parks its property in the state: If your organization maintains a check-
ing account or owns or rents property in any jurisdiction, it generally is
subject to the local filing requirements.
Avoiding some sticky state issues
It’s important to remember that because of the variation of state laws, you
may come across some unexpected trouble spots when filing Form 990s in
states other than your own. For example:
 Many states have dollar limits for triggering filing requirements that are
much lower than the general IRS dollar limitation of having a minimum
of $25,000 in gross receipts.
 Even if a state jurisdiction accepts the Form 990 or Form 990-EZ as filed
with the IRS, this alone may not be enough to provide all the required
information a state may ask for.
For instance, the state may require additional financial statements,
notes to financial statements, additional financial schedules, reports on
financial statements by an independent accountant, and answers to
additional questions.
Each jurisdiction has its own rules, so in order to sidestep the sticky issues,
carefully review a state’s laws prior to filing.
Avoiding Common 990 Nightmares
Filing Form 990s is tedious enough without making common (avoidable) mis-
takes that require corrective action and delay processing. Making these mis-
takes may cause the IRS to send the return back to you, or require you to
provide additional information. In some cases, missing information can even
trigger an audit.
Here are a few things to remember forever (okay, at least until after your
filing date):
109
Chapter 7: Filing the Dreaded Form 990

 Get the return signed by the right person. To make a return complete,
an authorized officer of the nonprofit organization must sign the tax return
in the space provided. The officer may be a president, vice-president,
treasurer, assistant treasurer, chief accounting officer, or other corpo-
rate or association officer who’s authorized to sign. If the return is filed
for a trust, it must be signed by an authorized trustee.
 Check the correct boxes. Several sections of Form 990 and 990-EZ ask
you to check boxes or answer “yes” or “no” to specific questions about
your organization’s operations and activities. Make sure your organiza-
tion discusses these questions with the preparer or firm responsible for
completing the return. In particular, make sure that the information sub-
mitted is current and verified each year instead of being blindly copied
off of a prior year’s return.
 Leave the right spaces blank. For example, if an officer or employee of
the organization prepares the return, leave the paid preparer’s space
blank. Only someone who’s paid to prepare the tax return should sign
the return and fill in his or her name as the paid preparer.
 Keep your records for at least three years. You need to keep your non-
profit organization’s records for three years from the date that the
return is due or filed, whichever is later. However, keep records that
verify what the organization paid for property much longer — generally
until the property is sold or otherwise disposed of. Keep the returns
themselves indefinitely.
 Assemble accurately. Form 990 or Form 990-EZ must be assembled with
supporting documents in the following order: Form 990 or Form 990-EZ;
Schedule A; Schedule B; attachments to Form 990 or 990-EZ; attach-
ments to Schedule A; and attachments to Schedule B. The instructions
for each type of Form 990 lists the order of attachments.
 Label attachments. If attachments are filed with your form, they must be
labeled appropriately with the form number and tax year, the organiza-
tion’s name, and the employer identification number.
Researching Form 990s Online
IRS Form 990 is a major source of nonprofit research in the United States.
Private foundations, government entities, and individual donors all routinely
research the information contained on Form 990s and 990-PFs.
For the public, Form 990 or 990-EZ may be the primary (or even sole) sources
of information about a particular organization. The public can use these forms
to find out all sorts of information, such as how the organization is accom-
plishing its mission or how its grants are paid to support other organizations.

Chapter 7: Filing the Dreaded Form 990
Getting Form 990 directly from a nonprofit
Any organization filing Form 990, 990-EZ, or 990-
PF must make the annual return available to the
public for inspection. A nonprofit must also pro-
vide copies of its annual returns or exemption
application to anyone who requests a copy in
person or in writing (unless these documents
are otherwise widely available, such as being
posted on the organization’s Web site).
Nonprofits are required to make their annual
returns and exemption application available for
public inspection (without charge) at their
regional and district offices during regular busi-
ness hours. Generally if the office has employ-
ees who are paid for 120 hours or more a week,
the open-door policy requirement applies.
However, if a site doesn’t serve as an office for
management staff other than managers who
are involved only in managing the exempt func-
tion activities at that site, the doors need not be
opened for the inspection of Form 990. If the
nonprofit doesn’t maintain a permanent office at
all, it can comply with the inspection rules by
making the documents available at a reason-
able location of its choice within a reasonable
amount of time after receiving request for
inspection (about two weeks) and setting a rea-
sonable time of day for the inspection.
However, this mandatory open-door policy does
have some limits. For example, the nonprofit can
require that an employee be present to monitor
an inspection. Also, the nonprofit must allow the
“inspectors” to take notes and make photo-
copies, but only if the individual brings photo-
copying equipment to the place of inspection.
A nonprofit can also opt to mail a copy of the
requested forms instead of allowing an inspec-
tion. A nonprofit must mail the copy within two
weeks of receipt of the request. The organiza-
tion can charge for photocopying and postage
only if the person requesting the documents
consents to the charge.
Finally, a nonprofit may also disregard any
harassment-intended requests for copies of any
document beyond the first two requests received
within any 30-day period, or the first four
requests received within any one-year period
from the same individual or the same address.

search for an organization by name or to look for organizations that have a
particular keyword in their name. For example, if I enter the word “animals,”
the search function pulls up charities that donate causes furthering the inter-
ests of nonhuman creatures. By clicking the hypertext links, I can access a
sample profile for the organization, and by scrolling down, I can see the three
most recently filed Form 990s.
Sampling Some Form 990s
Any IRS form looks daunting at first glance. But once you know what you’re
looking for, it can be empowering to know that such extensive data about any
nonprofit organization is available to you. In fact, it’s reassuring that every
organization must report the same information on identical lines and in a
format that varies relatively little. This standardization is the very reason
that many states have been accepting Form 990 in lieu of their own filing
requirements. (Check out the section “Satisfying the States with Form 990”
earlier in the chapter for more details.) If you’re still concerned about the
daunting nature of Form 990s, don’t worry — this section guides you through
all the important information on the 990 and 990-EZ.
Finding answers on the Form 990
Each organization’s Form 990 holds a wealth of important information, as the
following sections explain. This goes for any size or type of nonprofit entity.
How much income did the organization receive and from where?
Part I of Form 990 (shown in Figure 7-1) is divided into three subparts:
Revenue, Expenses, and Net Assets. The Revenue subpart is the focus here. It
reports all of the organization’s income broken down over more than a dozen
sources, including contributions, program service revenue, membership
dues, and so on. The total of all the revenue sources is shown on Line 12
(which is labeled “Total revenue”) at the bottom of the Revenue subpart.
How did the nonprofit organization spend its money?
Lines 13-17 on a Form 990 show where the money goes. Line 17 reports total
expenses, which include program expenses, management expenses, and
fundraising expenses.

Chapter 7: Filing the Dreaded Form 990

What are the assets of the organization?
The net assets of the organization are broken down in lines 18–21. Line 18
tells whether the organization operated at a surplus or deficit for the year.
Line 19 tells you the organization’s net assets at the beginning of the year.
Line 20 shows any other changes in net assets or fund balances, and Line 21
reveals what the net assets or fund balances are at the end of the year.
What programs does the organization conduct?
Part III of Form 990 reveals a lot about what the nonprofit organization actu-
ally does. For example, the form states the organization’s primary purpose 
on a short line near the top. For each program the organization conducts, it
must describe the program’s purpose, and it must include other important
information, such as the number of clients served or the service units issued.
To the right of this information, the nonprofit lists the expenses for each pro-
gram. This helps the public assess the activities of the nonprofit.
Who are the filer’s board members and 
how much does its top staff get paid?
Part V-A of Form 990 lists the names of current officers, directors, trustees,
and key employees. It also shows whether any board member receives any
compensation for the duties he or she performs, and if so, how much.
Did the nonprofit board members engage in any 
“self-dealing” transactions during the year?
Line 2 of Schedule A asks a series of questions about transactions among the
nonprofit organization, directors, and key employees. For example, Line 2a
asks whether any sale, exchange, or leasing of property occurred between
the filer and any board member or key employee. If the answer is “yes” to any
of the questions in this part of the form, the nonprofit is required to attach a
detailed statement explaining the transactions.
Did the organization do any lobbying?
Many nonprofit groups advocate for changes in public policy as part of their
mission. The term lobbying refers to legal attempts to influence legislators,
for example, to propose and vote for specific laws, or to support or oppose
proposals made by others.
You can tell if an organization has engaged in lobbying by looking at Line 1 of
Schedule A’s Part III (Statement of Activities). This line asks whether the filer
attempted to influence national, state, or local legislation. If the filer answers
“yes,” it must report its expenses and lobbying activities.

Breezing through Form 990-EZ
Form 990-EZ is much shorter than Form 990, but it can be just as enlightening
in many respects. The first page of Form 990-EZ is shown in Figure 7-2. The
following sections go over a few things that you can find out from this form.
How does the organization derive its revenue?
To find out about an organization’s revenue, take a look at Part I, Lines 1–8.
This part of the form tells you about activities, donations, and grants.
How does the organization spend its money?
Part I, Lines 10–16, of the Form 990-EZ reports expenses by object, not func-
tion. Accordingly, the form doesn’t really tell you if the organization is spend-
ing money in a way that meets its mission. However, program services expenses
for the current year are identified on Line 32, which means that you can iden-
tify the portion of the total expenses that’s devoted to program services.
Also, Part II describes the organization’s major activities and the total
expenses for each.
Is the organization in debt?
Line 27 shows the balance of assets over liabilities, which is referred to as 
the balance of funds or net assets. Nonprofits need to accumulate sufficient
resources to carry out operations in the face of routine fluctuations in rev-
enue. For this reason, all healthy nonprofit organizations should show a posi-
tive balance of funds on the tax return.
Is the organization paying its board members appropriately?
Part IV lists officers, directors, trustees, and key employees and their
salaries. Board members of nonprofits generally serve on a voluntary basis,
but the CEO is usually compensated. In some organizations, however, board
members also work for the organization in some capacity. If you come across
this, don’t worry — it’s generally permissible. Key employees, such as offi-
cers, directors, and trustees, may receive compensation. So, if you want to
find out their salaries, just take a look at Part IV.

Chapter 8
The Responsibilities of the Board
In This Chapter
 Discovering what directors do
 Identifying the director’s duties
 Understanding your rights as a director
 Looking to SOX when adopting practices for your board
I
n 2004, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee proposed a number of regula-
tions and reforms to correct perceived problems with how the nation’s
nonprofits were governing themselves. The Committee found that many non-
profits (even some of the largest ones, such as the Red Cross) didn’t have
basic accounting procedures in place for running programs. The Committee
concluded that the nonprofit boards weren’t doing a good job of overseeing
their organizations.
To improve this situation, many nonprofits are voluntarily adopting basic
organizational and management policies that are based on the requirements of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which was passed for for-profit organizations in 2002.
This chapter takes a look at the evolving role of boards of directors in the
world of nonprofit organizations, including their powers and duties under
current law. (Check out Chapter 4 for some hands-on info about creating your
own board of directors.)
Introducing the Basics of 
the Board of Directors
Directors, as their name implies, direct the course of an organization. They sit
at the strategic and financial helm of the organization. At that helm are usu-
ally several additional directors that collectively make up what is called the
board of directors. The experience and backgrounds of the board members
varies widely in each nonprofit, as does the process of selecting the board.

118
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 
As far as duties are concerned, in nonprofit corporations, directors are
guardians of assets and resources. Their focus is on accomplishing the mis-
sion statement of the organization, and ensuring that sufficient resources
flow into the nonprofit entity.
In some organizations, directors have worn more than one hat. For example,
they have been employed by the nonprofit corporation, or they have acted as
officers or agents in other capacities. This multi-hat practice is now discour-
aged because of the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). (See the later
section “SOX Policies and Nonprofit Boards.”) Instead, most nonprofits are
encouraged to have a majority of independent board members who have
little or no connection with the organization other than serving on the board.
Striking a balance: Strategic boards 
versus meddlesome ones
It’s generally accepted that boards are responsible for the direction of the
organization and charged with seeing that the organization fulfills its mission.
However, it isn’t the role of the board (whose members don’t work full time)
to become involved in the day-to-day operations of the organization. For
example, boards shouldn’t worry about tasks such as ordering office sup-
plies, evaluating administrative staff, or deciding whether the copy machine
breaks down too often.
Instead, boards should strive to define the organization’s objectives and both
the short- and long-term strategies for achieving them. Boards should
address issues that are similar to the following:
 Whether the public is aware of the organization’s mission
 Whether the nonprofit’s programs are reaching the intended beneficiaries
 How well the purposes for which the organization was set up are being
served
The board should also set up effective procedures for evaluating manage-
ment and verifying the information that it receives from management. These
tasks ensure that the day-to-day operations of the organization and the con-
trols and procedures that are in place are working.
But what if the board (or one of its members) smells a rat? Or senses ineffi-
ciency? It should never hide behind its mandate to do strategic planning to
ignore a looming crisis. As a board member, it’s your duty to bring the issues
to the forefront, address them as a board, obtain the necessary information
from management, and resolve the issue so that the goals of your organiza-
tion may be met.

Electing the board of directors
Directors of nonprofit corporations can be selected, appointed, or recruited
in any way that the organization’s bylaws specify (see Chapter 4 for more on
bylaws). A corporation’s bylaws also usually specify how many people will sit
on the board. Typically, the number is no less than seven and no more than
ten. However, there may be more or fewer directors depending on the spe-
cific provisions of the bylaws or applicable state laws. Bylaws also specify
the powers and duties of the directors (see the section “Understanding a
Director’s Responsibilities” later in the chapter for more).
If something isn’t covered under the bylaws, the law of the state in which the
nonprofit is incorporated or located will apply. For example, if election
requirements aren’t specified in the bylaws and you’re in Wisconsin, you can
look to the Wisconsin statutes that cover these issues for nonprofits.
Typically directors are elected for a term of one or more years. Often the
terms are staggered, which means that each director’s term is set up to expire
in a different year so that the nonprofit is never confronted with a board com-
pletely filled with novices in a single year. Many organizations, such as reli-
gious ones, have boards that are self-perpetuating, meaning that the current
board elects the new members.
You may hear the following common terms in connection with boards:
 Ex officio status: An ex officio member is automatically given a seat on
the board because that person holds some other related position. For
example, an officer of the corporation or of a related nonprofit entity
may be an ex officio board member.
 Honorary, life, or emeritus status: These are honorary designations,
and are purely symbolic in that the people who hold these titles gener-
ally don’t have the right to vote on issues. Usually, these titles are
awarded to people who have served on the board for a long time in the
past, have given a lot of money to the organization, or have raised a lot
of money for it.
Governing as a body
Individual directors sitting on boards can’t do much on their own; a board of
directors governs as a body. The board, as a whole, may have considerable
power, but the individual directors must come to a level of consensus speci-
fied in the bylaws (check out Chapter 4 for more on bylaws) in order to act.
119
Chapter 8: The Responsibilities of the Board

Despite the fact that an individual director has virtually no power, he or she
can still be held liable for corporate actions in certain circumstances, partic-
ularly when the board takes actions outside of its legal scope of authority (as
discussed in the later section “Understanding a Director’s Responsibilities”).
The key functions of a board
Congress and a number of costly studies have looked at what makes non-
profit boards tick. In particular, they examined the key functions that direc-
tors must perform. According to a 2005 study by Johns Hopkins University,
the most important key functions of a nonprofit board of directors include
the following:
 Setting mission statements: The mission statement of an organization
defines its reason for existence (check out Chapter 4 for more on creat-
ing a mission statement). An organization’s statement may evolve over
time, so the board is always busy. A whopping 93 percent of the respon-
dents surveyed in the Johns Hopkins study said that they look to their
board of directors to establish the organization’s mission.
 Selecting the chief executive and financial officers and deciding how
much to pay him or her: A board of directors doesn’t get involved in the
day-to-day operations of an organization, but it does hire and fire man-
agement, such as the chief executive officer. Eighty-eight percent of the
nonprofits surveyed said that they rely on their boards to do this.
 Reviewing auditing practices and polices: Many of the nonprofits sur-
veyed said that they had independent audits. Even if these nonprofits
didn’t have audits, they indicated that they relied on their boards to
evaluate financial data and communicate with accounting professionals.
 Approving significant financial transactions: Most of the nonprofits
surveyed (81 percent) said that they relied on their boards to review
and approve major financial transactions proposed by management.
 Establishing the budgets: Most nonprofits leave the budgeting process
to the board, probably because this is a function so closely related to
achieving the organization’s objectives.
The legal obligations of directors
Many state laws provide immunity for directors of nonprofit organizations
that are acting within the legal bounds of their authority. But, even if your
state doesn’t provide immunity, there are limitations on when various groups
can and can’t sue directors. For example, the following groups can’t sue a
board or its individual directors:
120
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 

 Donors: No matter how much money they put up, donors to nonprofit
organizations can’t sue the board of directors. However, some exceptions
do exist. For example, if a donor gives funds that are earmarked for a cer-
tain purpose to an organization and the nonprofit spends the money on
another purpose, a particularly effective lawyer may take the case.
 Beneficiaries and people who receive services from the nonprofit:
Generally, the intended beneficiaries of a nonprofit can’t sue the direc-
tors either. For example, an animal welfare advocate couldn’t sue a non-
profit with a mission of enforcing animal rights. And a battered woman
couldn’t sue a sheltering organization.
This isn’t the vacuum in accountability it seems to be at first glance. In
most states, the attorney general is an aggressive advocate for the bene-
ficiaries of nonprofits, with broad powers to investigate, sue, and other-
wise publicly embarrass corrupt and negligent directors.
 The members who elect them: To the extent that directors are elected,
they may lose their office via the elective process, or may be removed
under specific circumstances specified in the bylaws.
Understanding a Director’s
Responsibilities
A director’s duties stem from several sources, with the most important being
the mission or purpose of the organization, the bylaws of the organization,
and laws of the state in which the nonprofit organization is located.
The first task that should be on the list of any director who wants to avoid
becoming embroiled in controversy and legal liability, is to thoroughly under-
stand the purpose of the organization. The purpose of the organization is
usually embodied in its mission statement (flip to Chapter 4 for more details
on mission statements).
Directors’ common-law duties
Even though nonprofits are creatures of state law and have unique missions,
all of their directors are generally subject to a few common duties. (Common
law is a culmination of court decisions and precedents that are relied on to
establish legal principles.) The duties discussed in this section are taken
from a myriad of state cases and statutes, and are general guidelines to which
directors must adhere if they want to be able to defend their organization
against a lawsuit.
121
Chapter 8: The Responsibilities of the Board

Many states offer directors of both incorporated and unincorporated non-
profit organizations immunity as long as they’re acting on behalf of the corpo-
ration and within the scope of authority authorized by the corporation.
The duty of care
The duty of care is a two-part test. First, a director must be informed about
matters within the scope of the board’s authority and discretion. Second, the
director must exercise reasonable care in making decisions. (This second
part is sometimes called the business judgment rule.)
This two-part test seems so obvious that you probably wonder why it has to
be legally mandated. Nevertheless, countless court cases have centered on
whether directors have acted with due care in approving financial transac-
tions, rubber stamping budgets, and so on.
The following are some duties that directors can perform to establish that
they have acted as careful and informed directors:
 Show up for meetings: It’s difficult to argue in the course of a lawsuit that
you cared passionately about the organization when you never took the
time to go to the meetings during which the issues that are the subject of
the litigation or investigation were being discussed. In some states and
organizations, missing meetings is cause for removing a director.
Directors usually have to attend meetings to vote and can’t vote by
proxy, like shareholders are permitted to do. However, some states allow
directors to “attend” via telephone.
 Exercise independent judgment: Make up your own mind on issues that
are before the board, and if something doesn’t make sense, ask ques-
tions. Don’t just go along with it. No director should cast a vote based
on what another director thinks.
 Read the reports: Directors are entitled to rely on information provided
in reports by management and subcommittees (such as an audit com-
mittee). They can also rely on opinions by outside advisors, such as
their legal counsel. However, the rules that permit directors to rely on
information never apply if the director has personal knowledge that
would make reliance on the information implausible or unreasonable.
For example, if a director knows that a particular company is about to go
bankrupt and allowed the nonprofit to approve a contract with the com-
pany because management recommended the contract, he or she wouldn’t
be shielded by the business judgment rule.
 Adopt some meeting and control procedures: Directors aren’t responsi-
ble for performing the day-to-day operations of the corporation. But,
they are responsible for monitoring them. In order to monitor effectively,
board members should have some procedures in place to help them
take the pulse of the organization.
122
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 

For example, the boards may review revenue reports for specific pro-
grams, or they may have a standard list of transactions that they must
be specifically informed of.
 Document your actions: Some states allow directors to take action with-
out a specific vote or even a formal meeting. In these situations, it’s a
good idea for the board to document the actions it has taken and its rea-
sons for doing so.
For example, if your community youth group decides not to allow kids to
skateboard in the parking lot of the community center, this action
should be formally documented as well as communicated to the kids.
This documentation can be useful when a parent later sues for a broken
arm or cracked skull.
 Keep minutes: All boards and committees should keep minutes of what
they discuss and the actions that they opt to take and opt not to take. If
possible, document the concerns raised and information relied on in
addressing the issue.
Chapter 17 gives you some more guidance as to the things you need to know
to fulfill the duty of care.
The duty of loyalty
Directors of nonprofit organizations aren’t supposed to use their positions as
springboards for personal gain. This is known in legalese as the duty of loyalty.
The duty of loyalty requires directors to act in the interests of the corpora-
tion — not on their own behalf. For example, if you’re on the board of a
public museum, you’ll probably be questioned if you steer a lucrative public
relations contract to your spouse (as recently happened in one major city.)
So, if you’re a director of a nonprofit, you not only want to avoid actual con-
flicts of interest, but situations that simply look like conflicts to those who
have nothing better to do than drum up a scandal. Sending a contract to
someone you know personally because they do good work, or urging the
organization to employ them, is a recipe for having to defend yourself. If you
really want the board to consider an issue that could potentially be perceived
as an action in your personal interest as a board member, ask the Board to
vote on the action while you step out of the room. Better yet, have the min-
utes reflect that you didn’t participate in the vote.
Here are a few examples of transactions that seem like great ideas at the time,
but that can come back to haunt a well-intentioned director later:
 Making acquisitions of artwork, inventory, or equipment, or purchasing
services from companies in which a director or someone related to the
director has a financial interest
123
Chapter 8: The Responsibilities of the Board

 Asking the nonprofit organization to take a political position (for exam-
ple, on a specific tax or public works project) in which a director stands
to benefit financially
 Requesting that an organization expand its mission or programming
objectives to create an awareness or use products, services, or facilities
in which the director has an interest
Because many nonprofit organizations are community-based, and board
members are volunteers from the community, it’s easy for one thing to lead
to another, which creates a conflict of interest scandal that no one has ever
dreamed of. That’s why it’s a good idea for every nonprofit organization —
large or small — to have a written conflict of interest policy.
Here are some items that your organization may want to include in its conflict
of interest policy:
 A statement about how matters in which a board member is potentially
“interested” will be handled
 A provision requiring that transactions be approved by a majority of
directors who have no financial interest in the transaction
 A requirement of disclosure of relationships between directors and orga-
nizations with which the nonprofit organization does business
 A record of conflict issues that arise and how they’re resolved
Confidentiality
As you can probably imagine, board members aren’t free to blurt out informa-
tion to the public, especially when sensitive issues like medical or mental
health information of program recipients are involved. Unfortunately, though,
it isn’t usually that easy to ignore a reporter who shoves a microphone in
your face or calls unexpectedly demanding to know about some action (or
alleged inaction) by your organization. But, you have to remember that indi-
vidual directors aren’t spokespersons for the corporation and that they can
create infinite problems by thinking or acting like they are.
However, some meetings are open to the public, and board members, as
advocates for the organization, may need to talk about its activities to the
media and potential donors.
The general rule of thumb, however, is that directors shouldn’t disclose infor-
mation about the nonprofit’s finances or activities unless this information is
already known to the public through other sources.
124
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 

Disclosure of illegal activities
As with several of the other duties discussed in this section, the one I focus
on here should be a no-brainer. But, unfortunately, it’s never that simple.
If, as a director of a nonprofit organization, you discover illegal activity, you
have a duty to tell the rest of the board. Don’t just hope it will go away, or
that management will resolve it. Not only is the integrity and stability of your
organization at stake, but you can also end up with some sticky personal lia-
bility issues yourself if you’re indicted. You could also potentially end up with
a legal bill for advice on how to respond to inquiries made of you down the
road if you don’t dump the issue in the board’s lap early on.
If by some unfortunate chance you’re deemed as being complicit in the
wrong-doing by failing to report it to the board (state attorney generals love
this sort of thing), you may really be out in the cold. Depending on your orga-
nization’s bylaws, you may not be indemnified (paid back) for the legal fees
you incur defending your decision to keep mum.
If it’s the board itself that appears to be taking illegal action, excuse yourself
from the vote, and contact your personal attorney.
In some states, if registration with the state isn’t completed properly, is
expired, or is suspended, the directors may be personally liable for the actions
and obligations of the nonprofit because laws granting legal immunity to direc-
tors of validly registered nonprofits may not apply to criminal activities.
Other important board of director duties
Not every duty of a director is spelled out in bylaws and state statutes. This
is because a board’s responsibilities often evolve in response to the realities
of carrying out the organization’s mission.
Some of the duties and typical tasks of a board’s directors may include the
following:
 Defining the mission and long-term goals of the entity: Missions often
evolve over time, and an organization is usually evaluated by its success
in meeting its mission (as discussed in Chapter 4).
 Hiring and firing management and other key employees: Even though
board members often serve in a voluntary capacity, and many organiza-
tions function primarily using services provided by volunteers, most
nonprofits of any size have key managerial employees that must be
hired and fired by the board.
125
Chapter 8: The Responsibilities of the Board

 Receiving and reviewing reports from management: Board members
are usually provided with detailed information that allows them to
assess how the organization is doing financially and whether its pro-
grams are effectively meeting its mission. The ability of the board to
understand and intelligently act as a cohesive group on the information
it is receiving is essential to the health of any nonprofit.
 Authorizing major projects: Even though boards don’t become
embroiled in the day-to-day minutiae of running the organization, they
should be fully informed about major projects and program initiatives.
 Handling lawsuits and litigation: Ideally, nonprofits avoid becoming
involved in lawsuits, litigation, and the threat of such. However, when
liability issues rear their ugly head, the board must deal with them.
 Managing the media: It’s a basic fact of fundraising that most nonprofit
organizations can’t afford a hint of scandal. Negative press can mean nega-
tive cash flow. For this reason, boards need to be kept in the loop on public
relations issues, and must respond to inquiries and challenges on behalf of
the organization. (Check out Chapter 19 for tips on handling the media.)
Going above and beyond 
the scope of authority
To make an organization run smoothly, directors often perform advisory and
fundraising functions that aren’t specifically spelled out under bylaws and
state statutes. These functions, although not always mandated, can be criti-
cal to the well-being and positive public perception of the nonprofit entity.
Sometimes the functions are delegated to individual board members.
When carrying out these extra duties, directors must make sure that they’re
acting within the scope of authority granted to them under state law and the
bylaws. Scope of authority basically means that directors have the authority
necessary to carry out their legal and designated duties, and to further the
nonprofit organization’s mission. If a director acts beyond the scope of his or
her authority, the director may forgo some of the legal protections that non-
profit directors normally have.
For example, assume that a director of a nonprofit community recreational
facility wants to open a hot dog stand in front of the facility. Assume that the
directors go by the book procedurally in voting on this action and approve
the food stand. Now, imagine that there’s an outbreak of salmonella from food
sold at the stand, and a lawsuit is brought against the directors of the organi-
zation. This stand may be well beyond the mission and hence the scope of
authority of the community facility. On the other hand, if this is deemed a
fundraising activity that’s within the scope of the nonprofit mission, the
board of directors would enjoy immunity in many states for their actions.

Extra obligations for directors 
who are trustees
If your nonprofit organization operates a trust, the directors who sit on the
board may be deemed trustees of the funds. A trustee is a person legally in
charge of managing property for a third party. If you’re one of these directors
who falls into the special legal classification of “trustee,” you’ll have stricter
duties than the ones outlined in the previous few sections. While there’s little
leeway for directors in conflict situations, someone who acts as a trustee on
behalf of a trust is given absolutely no wiggle room whatsoever.
127
Chapter 8: The Responsibilities of the Board
A day in the life of a nonprofit executive director
The following was contributed by Judith
Steininger, who is both a serial volunteer and
nonprofit board member.
Generally speaking, an executive director or
CEO of a nonprofit organization is the person in
the visible leadership position of the organiza-
tion. His or her professional reputation is tied to
the organization’s success.
If an employee of the organization absconds
with tens of thousand of dollars, he or she may
go to jail, but the CEO will also share blame in
the eyes of the organization’s members and the
public at large.
Regardless of the size of the organization, the
CEO sets the moral tone. It’s usually his or her
job to model the values of the organization,
ensure adherence to the organization’s mission
on a daily basis, and report to the board.
The CEO is also the public face and spokesper-
son for the organization. If there’s trouble at a
rehab center, a homeless person from a shelter
dies outside the front door on a cold night, a
donor doesn’t like a textbook being used in a
particular class at a small private university, or
a season ticket holder-donor thinks there is just
too much Shostakovich being played this year,
he wants a call from the CEO ASAP.
A typical day for a CEO might include a morning
meeting with the grant-writing department or
the marketing department, and everything is on
deadline. There may be a meeting with the
developer of a new wing of one of the organi-
zation’s facilities.
For lunch, the CEO may be expected meet with
and thank a group of volunteers. The day may
be interrupted with frantic calls from program
managers, volunteers, and administrators. The
balance of the day may be taken up with meet-
ings on issues such as the ever-increasing
healthcare costs for the nonprofit’s employees.
Should they raise premiums or cut benefits
knowing that the salaries of everyone at a non-
profit are usually several percentage points
below those in profit-making institutions? Will
two or three key people leave as a result?
Evening may be filled with events and award
dinners for those who contribute to and support
the organization, including events sponsored by
other nonprofit organizations. The CEO will, by
the end of the day, have thanked many people
for supporting the organization, and hopefully,
have been thanked at least once by a board
member or stakeholder.

If you’re in the unenviable position of serving as a trustee, here are a few crit-
ical rules to remember regarding conflicts of interest:
 If a gift is made to the nonprofit corporation with specific conditions
attached to it (called a restricted gift), adhere strictly to the terms. The
organization is deemed a trustee of these gifted funds.
 If the nonprofit corporation is deemed a trustee of funds in an employee
benefit plan, don’t dip into these funds to meet other organizational needs.
 If prior gifts were made based on the nonprofit’s mission, and the mission
then changes, the nonprofit may be in the position of acting as a trustee to
ensure that the prior gifts are matched up with programs that fulfill the
prior mission.
Funds held by the corporation in trust should be held in segregated accounts
and clearly identified on the organization’s financial statements.
Your Rights as a Director
It’s a sad fact of life that volunteer directors run the risk of being sued in the
course of carrying out duties for which they aren’t paid. Fortunately, many
state laws realize the importance of philanthropy and volunteerism and have
adopted laws to protect directors from lawsuits when they’re acting on
behalf of the organization and within the scope of their authority.
This section covers several principles gleaned from court cases and other
legal precedents. It’s a summary of legal doctrines that support directors in
doing good work.
Protection under the business 
judgment rule
The business judgment rule is a legal doctrine that protects directors of for-
profit corporations from having to second-guess their actions — as long as
they’re acting in a reasonable, informed manner that they believe to be in the
best interests of their corporation. Many courts have applied this rule to the
nonprofit context discussed here.
If a corporate director undertakes an action in good faith, exercises indepen-
dent judgment, and has taken steps to be reasonably informed, courts have
ruled that litigants shouldn’t be permitted to second-guess their decisions.
Hindsight is 20/20, the courts figure.
128
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 

By the same token, directors don’t have to pass an IQ test. A bad business
decision won’t be the basis for a winning lawsuit, unless the decision was
made for bad motives (such as the director’s financial self-interest).
Access to corporate books and records
Directors of both for-profit and nonprofit corporations have an absolute right
to view the corporate books and records. If they can’t look at them, who can?
If you serve on a board, you can also usually permit your attorney or accoun-
tant to see the data so that he or she can advise you personally.
Access to the minutes
Directors have a right to receive a copy of the minutes from every meeting.
Even though you may be tempted to toss them aside after hashing out an
issue for hours — don’t. Those minutes can come back to haunt you years
later when the board needs to review them to see why an action was or
wasn’t taken.
Minutes are the only record memorializing what took place at a meeting, and
they can have unanticipated legal significance. So, even though you can’t
change time, do make sure the minutes are complete, and that the reasons for
any controversial actions and votes taken are fully (and accurately) reflected.
Communication with management
If you’re a director of a nonprofit, you have the right to communicate (reason-
ably) with management. If something doesn’t make sense on the financial
front, you can call up the chief executive officer or chief financial officer and
ask questions.
You don’t have the right to restrict or interfere with these individuals in car-
rying out their own duties. You also can’t make demands on staff or organiza-
tional resources without approval from the board as a whole.
The right to dissention from board actions
There isn’t always rationality in numbers. It’s amazing how opinions fall like
dominos in some settings, with each person adopting another’s viewpoint.
Not only do you have a right to vote as a board member, in many states you
can also go on record as having dissented (disagreed) with the majority.
129
Chapter 8: The Responsibilities of the Board

SOX Policies and Nonprofit Boards
“Board governance” has been a buzz phrase in corporate America since
Enron, the world’s largest energy corporation, suddenly filed for bankruptcy
in 2001. Now the term is becoming part of the vernacular of just about every
nonprofit organization in America.
Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) is a complicated law that was passed in 2002, in the
wake of the Enron bankruptcy. It ushers in new principles of independence
and accountability for boards of directors of public corporations, and it’s
likely to impact the outcome of future lawsuits brought against nonprofit cor-
porations and boards — even though, technically, the law doesn’t apply to
them. Nevertheless, the law is regarded as the “gold standard” for gover-
nance and accountability.
In fact, it’s actually a myth that SOX doesn’t affect nonprofit organizations.
Even though nonpublic corporations aren’t currently subject to Sarbanes-
Oxley, they are accountable to their stakeholders (for example, donors, 
members, and granting authorities). Accordingly, most lawyers agree (to the
extent that lawyers ever agree on anything) that nonprofit organizations should
move toward voluntarily adopting some of the governance standards pro-
vided in SOX. These protective measures include adopting whistle-blower
and document-retention policies, installing independent board members,
establishing audit and compensation committees, evaluating board members,
and other measures, all of which are discussed in this section.
Policies that nonprofit boards are required
to adopt after SOX
Two provisions of SOX do actually apply to nonprofits as mandatory legal
requirements (rather than optional best practices). These two provisions of
the law include adopting the following:
 Whistle-blower policies: Because of SOX, boards of nonprofit organiza-
tions are required to develop formal procedures for handling complaints
about financial misdeeds within the organization. They’re also required
to prevent retaliation against those who come forward to report these
misdeeds. (Whistle-blower policy requirements are discussed in more
detail in Chapter 13.) Under the law, nonprofits are also required to
make sure that complaints are investigated. They must document that
corrective actions have been taken.
130
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 

 Document retention and destruction policies: SOX requires nonprofit
organizations to have written, mandatory document-retention and 
periodic-destruction policies that include guidelines for electronic files
and voicemail. The policies must specify that if official investigation is
contemplated, those who destroy documents that are relevant to the
investigation will be subject to stringent criminal penalties. If you even
suspect any illegal activity, stop the document shredders immediately 
in order to avoid criminal obstruction.
Following the trend toward 
independent boards
When Congress held hearings after the bankruptcy of the energy giant, Enron,
it found a definite historical correlation between corporate fraud and boards
of directors dominated by insiders who had financial ties to the company. So,
Congress took a hard line, in the private sector context, on the issue of board
independence. This same thinking found its way into the nonprofit sector 
as well.
However, nonprofits boards find this change difficult to adapt to because
most nonprofit board members serve as volunteers and likely have a prior
connection or commitment to the organization. For example, members are
often recruited from the ranks of dedicated volunteers and philanthropists
who are savvier at raising funds than managing them on behalf of an organi-
zation. Often board members are intimately familiar and even passionate
about the needs of organizational stakeholders, yet ill-equipped to deal with
the complicated overlay of bylaws, state laws, and federal tax-exemption reg-
ulations imposed on their organizations.
But, it’s impractical for most organizations to scrap the dedicated board
members they have in favor of independent outsiders who may not under-
stand the delicate balance between the mission, financial constraints, and
community image of the organization. It is, however, important that organiza-
tions recruit and retain as many independent board members as possible —
particularly to serve on sensitive committees, such as the audit committee
(flip to Chapter 10 for more on audit committees).
The criteria for independent directors
This section shows you what makes a director “independent” according to
the standards set forth under SOX. Even though this law applies primarily to
for-profit corporations, it’s increasingly being viewed as a source of the best
practices for nonprofit organizations.
131
Chapter 8: The Responsibilities of the Board

According to SOX, an independent director can’t serve “directly or indirectly
as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship
with the company.” This provision is intended to apply to the company’s affil-
iates as well as the company itself. For example, the CEO of a company
wouldn’t be considered an independent director if he or she served on the
board of a subsidiary company.
This provision is intended to stop directors of nonprofit boards from conve-
niently steering lucrative contracts to their own companies. SOX-related stan-
dards also require companies to know what directors have done in the three
years prior to joining the board. A director’s independence may be deemed
compromised if the director was an employee or executive officer of a related
company in the three years prior to joining the board of directors.
Loss of independent classification due to prohibited payments
Prior to SOX, many directors received large payments, personal loans, and
bonuses that they were unable to justify to the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) and company shareholders. Criminal proceedings ensued
in many cases, and irreversible damage was done to the companies that
directors had treated as their personal trust funds. SOX prohibits personal
loans to directors, and so should your nonprofit organization.
132
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 
Some bad, bad board moves
Even the largest, most well-established non-
profits have found themselves under the glare
of unwelcome public scrutiny in recent years.
Consider the following examples:
 The board of the American Red Cross was
forced to answer for a $200 million ill-
advised action in which it used funds ear-
marked for surviving family members and
victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks
for blood distribution programs instead.
 A high-profile scandal in California led to
the collapse of a prominent nonprofit orga-
nization that defrauded esteemed contribu-
tors by using donations intended for other
charities to cover its own costs.
 In 2003, the United Way became embroiled
in a scandal that paraded excessive salaries
and the misuse of funds.
 In the late 1990s, Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer spearheaded an investigation involv-
ing the Hale House, a highly respected
Harlem charity with a 30-year history of
caring for homeless infants and toddlers.
The controversy began when the investiga-
tion revealed that Dr. Lorraine Hale, a direc-
tor, may have permitted the organization to
divert hundreds of thousands of dollars
toward self-serving projects that were unre-
lated to the organization’s mission.

Other savvy SOX moves for directors
In addition to providing standards for independence, SOX contains some
other provisions that board members may want to consider having their
organizations adopt as the “gold standard” of nonprofit governance.
Holding meetings without management being present
After SOX, more boards began holding meetings outside of the earshot of
management. These boards took this move because excluding the top dogs
from meetings enables the boards to more easily evaluate the performance
and independence of management.
Forming committees for nominating directors
Many organizations are adopting specific procedures for recruiting and nomi-
nating qualified directors, and they’re also publicly disclosing these policies.
Forming compensation committees
With all the compensation scandals in both the profit and nonprofit sectors,
many boards are adopting compensation committees made up of independent
members. These committees help to closely study the issue and make well-
considered recommendations. (Flip to Chapter 6 for more details on conven-
ing a compensation committee.)
Establishing independent audit committees
Even though it may be impractical to form an entirely independent board of
directors, the board members that sit on the audit committee (discussed in
Chapter 10) should be independent. Audit committees deal with the outside
accountants and auditors, and they address issues relating to the accuracy of
the organization’s financial statement.
Making governance guidelines public
Similar to the SOX requirements of for-profit corporations, many nonprofit
organizations are opting to post their corporate governance guidelines on
their Web sites. The following is a checklist of issues that your board may
want to address in creating its own guidelines for governing the organization:
 Director qualification standards, including procedures for training and
continuing education
 Responsibilities of directors, including obligations to attend meetings
 Policies for director access to management and independent advisors
133
Chapter 8: The Responsibilities of the Board

 Procedures for determining director compensation
 Management succession policies
 A procedure for the board to conduct an annual self-evaluation
Evaluating the board’s performance
An important component of board self-governance can be the board’s own
self-evaluation, which is a mandated exercise for all for-profit corporations
subject to SOX. It’s only a best practice for nonprofits.
Many boards tackle the self-evaluation requirement by giving board members
a questionnaire that asks them to rate how well the board has performed its
designated tasks. This approach can have unintended consequences: If the
board doesn’t address problems disclosed by negative feedback on a ques-
tionnaire, a perception may arise that the board isn’t diligent about fulfilling
its responsibility. Thus, the board may feel compelled to follow up on each
less-than-perfect rating it receives on the questionnaires.
If your organization uses questionnaires for self-evaluation, make sure the
questionnaires are preserved so that you can produce them in the unfortu-
nate event of a future lawsuit or investigation.
For most companies, a more practical approach to self-evaluation is to hold
regular meetings for purposes of board discussion and self-evaluation. During
such meetings, the board can determine what further action, if any, is neces-
sary as a result of the self-evaluation process. The issues raised in the meet-
ings and the details about how the issues were handled should be carefully
documented.

In This Chapter
 Understanding the basic committee structures
 Discovering the common committees nonprofits create
B
oards have limited amounts of time, and addressing every issue in
depth could easily turn meetings into retreats. As an alternative to
sequestering their members, many boards create committees to delegate key
issues to. A committee is generally made up of a subset of board members
that reports to the full board. The committee may or may not have authority
to act on its own.
Creating committees allows your board to delegate specific tasks and functions
to the board members who have the skill sets to best accomplish them. This
chapter identifies the different types of committees that your organization may
consider creating, and the types of functions typically delegated to them.
Basic Committee Structures
Some boards create committees in response to special tasks that arise (such
as hiring a CEO), and then they terminate the committee as the tasks are
accomplished. Other boards, however, set up committees and rules for them
well before issues arise.
The following are two types of committee structures that your board may
create (these terms refer to the duration that the committee’s authority is in
effect):

 Special committees: This type of committee (sometimes referred to as
an ad hoc committee) is a committee created by the board to resolve or
research a specific issue, such as the viability of a new project or the
handling of a litigation matter. This type of committee is generally cre-
ated by board resolution, which means that the board documents (and
perhaps votes) that it is taking this action.
Examples of special committees would include an executive search com-
mittee formed to select and recruit a chief executive officer, or a policy
committee formed to write and recommend policies for certain opera-
tions (such as branch operations).
 Standing committees: These committees are permanent committees
that may be provided for in the corporation’s bylaws or board resolu-
tions. The most common example of a standing committee is the audit
committee, which functions on an ongoing basis to review and evaluate
the organization’s financial matters (see Chapter 10 for more on audit
committees).
The powers of these committees depend on the bylaws or resolutions that
created them. A typical standing committee, for instance, may have consider-
able power to recommend action to the board or to decide which information
is relevant to a board’s decision. For example, a nominating committee may
decide which management candidates are actually considered by the board
(see the section “Types of Committees” later in the chapter for more on nomi-
nating committees).
Special committees may also have broad power. One reason a special com-
mittee may be formed is to protect the remaining board members from
having to assume responsibility or involvement with a particular decision.
Occasionally non-board members may be asked to serve on special commit-
tees (in a consultant capacity) because they may offer a particular perspec-
tive or expertise not found within the composition of board itself.
Forming a Committee
An organization’s board of directors is responsible for forming committees
when necessary. Committee members must be drawn from the current mem-
bers of the board itself, so having a talented and diverse board is an
extremely important ingredient to the success of an organization. The
board’s power to form committees is usually addressed in the organization’s
bylaws. A typical bylaw provision on this subject usually allows the board to
form any type of committee it deems appropriate, and also allows the board
to delegate certain powers to a committee.
136
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 

It’s important to note that although a board can delegate certain powers to a
committee, it’s the board at large that’s ultimately responsible for the deci-
sions it makes based on the work of a committee.
When committees are formed
Standing committees are generally formed at the onset of an organization’s
existence — usually at the first or second meeting of a newly formed board.
Special committees, on the other hand, usually evolve from a board discus-
sion of a pressing matter or issue that needs attention. At this time, the board
asks volunteer directors to sit on the committee in order to study the issue
and make a recommendation to the full board. The formation of a special
committee is noted in the minutes of the board meeting, along with what the
committee’s mission is, who will serve on it, who will chair it, and what time
frame it is on to accomplish its mission.
Who sits on a committee
The function of a committee drives who will serve on it. The board of direc-
tors looks at its roster and decides who would fulfill the functions of a particu-
lar committee — this is especially important with standing committees that
require special expertise (see the earlier section “Basic Committee Structures”
for details on standing committees). An organization’s audit committee gener-
ally requires that at least one committee member is well-versed in financial
matters. Where a committee is formed to accomplish a specific task, special
expertise may not be as important as other considerations, such as which
committee members have the time to devote themselves to the task.
What a committee’s process looks like
After a committee is appointed, it usually schedules its own meetings. Unless
face-to-face communications are required, many committees conduct some
meetings by teleconference. The first point of order at an initial committee
meeting is to decide what the scope of the task is, what form the committee’s
work product will take (for example, a report, a recommendation, an evalua-
tion, and so on), and who will do what to accomplish the committee’s goal. A
timetable with milestones is generally set and at the conclusion of the meet-
ing, the committee sets a date to reconvene so that each member can report
on the progress of an assigned task.
137
Chapter 9: Creating the Right Committee Structure

Minutes of committee meetings may be taken, depending on the formality of
the meetings, the type of committee, and the tasks assigned. However, where
a committee needs to report to the board on a periodic or ongoing basis,
minutes are usually required.
When a committee concludes its task, the committee chair reports the find-
ings and recommendations to the full board of directors. Discussion of the
committee’s conclusion generally follows, and individual committee mem-
bers may supplement the conclusion and answer questions from the board at
large. If the committee’s conclusion requires some form of action from the
board, a vote usually follows the committee’s report and is made part of the
board minutes.
Types of Committees
Committees can vary widely depending on the mission and organizational
requirements of an organization. This section discusses some examples of
common types of committees that your board may opt to form.
Establishing an executive committee
Because many boards meet monthly (or even less often), some organizations
create executive committees to deal with issues that come up between meet-
ings. Most executive committees are made up of a few directors within the
organization, and sometimes management (such as the CEO and CFO).
Executive committees can be an efficient solution for dealing with issues that
arise when it would be impractical or even impossible to convene the entire
board.
Executive committees must be delegated sufficient authority to act, which
means that the executive committee members may have considerable power
within the organization. So, the board should make sure its actions are prop-
erly documented and reported at regular meetings in case legal issues related
to their actions arise in the future.
Appointing a nominating committee
As the name suggests, the purpose of a nominating committee is to nominate
people who would make good board members. This type of committee is
138
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 

almost always a standing committee (see the section “Basic Committee
Structures” earlier in the chapter for details on standing committees).
The skill set of the prospective candidate is a starting point for identifying
quality candidates, but the committee’s responsibility generally doesn’t stop
there. Today, most nominating committees also have to consider issues such
as diversity, financial expertise, and fundraising ability.
Adding an audit committee
After the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX), audit committees have been
receiving a lot of attention in both for-profit and nonprofit organizations
(check out Chapter 13 for more on SOX and how it affects nonprofits). In the
nonprofit world, these committees are responsible for reviewing an organiza-
tion’s accounting and audit practices.
One specific function of the audit committee is to create a buffer between the
people that manage the nonprofit and the auditors and accountants who
verify the activities of management. So, most experts agree that the commit-
tee should consist entirely of directors who aren’t involved in the manage-
ment of the nonprofit.
Other typical functions of a nonprofit audit committee include the following:
 Hiring the audit or accounting firm: The audit committee should make
sure that the firm it hires is free of any conflicts. And, if appropriate, the
committee needs to confirm that the audit firm isn’t reviewing its own
accounting work (which would of course be a conflict of interests).
 Reviewing the audit and accounting policies of the organization: Many
reporting issues can arise. These issues can affect the accuracy and pre-
sentation of the financial statements. It’s the audit committee’s role,
then, to thoroughly vet these issues.
 Resolving issues that arise between the organization’s management
and the auditors: Because part of the auditors’ task is to verify the
actions of management and identify the presence of any possible error
or fraud, management and auditors should be independent from each
other. This means that the board may have to step in to resolve any
issues that arise instead of allowing management to negotiate with the
auditors (thus compromising the auditors’ independence).
 Reviewing the organization’s internal controls: The audit committee
must resolve issues relating to the controls within a nonprofit organiza-
tion. If these types of issues aren’t resolved, the reliability and integrity of
the information that appears on its financial statements can be affected.
139
Chapter 9: Creating the Right Committee Structure

Creating a compensation committee
Compensation can be a politically charged issue for nonprofits. On one hand,
most organizations must pay sufficient salaries to attract competent and
qualified people. On the other hand, however, there’s always a sentiment that
every dollar spent on executive salaries is a dollar that’s subtracted from
intended nonprofit program beneficiaries. Luckily, compensation committees
can help bridge the gap.
The role of a compensation committee typically includes the following duties:
 Researching what similar organizations pay: This research includes
identifying similar organizations and positions involving similar skill
sets.
 Documenting how the committee makes compensation decisions: This
documentation is important because if salaries are questioned, the com-
mittee needs to be able to explain how it decided on the salary it ulti-
mately awarded.
 Awarding raises: Typically compensation committees are charged with
evaluating staff, documenting the results of performance reviews, and
deciding the level of raises and bonuses to award.
Initiating an investment committee
Nonprofit organizations that have significant fund balances and cash
reserves must decide how to invest those funds. This function is usually dele-
gated to an investment committee. This committee may be required to obtain
the approval of the entire board for certain types of investments.
Because many states have regulations in effect that govern the levels of
acceptable risk and other issues that affect investment decisions, the invest-
ment committees must do their homework. (The Uniform Management of
Institutional Funds Act and other model acts are discussed in Chapter 2.)

All About Audit Committees
In This Chapter
 Exploring the world of audit committees
 Understanding audit committee requirements
 Determining your duties when serving on an audit committee
D
o you want to send a message from the get-go that your nonprofit orga-
nization is serious about maintaining its financial integrity and showing
that it’s squeaky clean when it comes to governance issues? If so, consider
forming an audit committee.
An audit committee is a subcommittee of the nonprofit’s board of directors.
The purpose of an audit committee is to review and direct the accounting
and audit practices of your organization. As such, the committee needs to be
solely made up of independent directors who aren’t employed by or involved
in the day-to-day management of the nonprofit organization.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (referred to as SOX), which passed in 2002, ensures
that the audit committees of publicly traded companies are carefully regu-
lated. While not legally applicable to nonprofits, SOX is a really good source
for developing standards that will determine the functions and responsibili-
ties of your voluntarily created audit committee.
This chapter explores the nuts and bolts of putting together an audit commit-
tee according to the SOX standards that apply to corporations. It also
explores the implementation of new standards for audit committee indepen-
dence, expertise, and objectivity.

The Role of the Audit Committee
Audit committees, in a nutshell, ensure the accuracy and integrity of the
financial statements of the organization upon which donors, members, and
other people rely. It’s the job of the audit committee to become familiar with
the financial statements and reports of the nonprofit and ask tough questions
of the accountants, the chief financial officer, and other individuals involved
in preparing them.
Audit committees are the norm among larger nonprofits, but they’re becom-
ing increasingly common in smaller organizations as well. A 2005 survey by
the National Urban Institute found that 20 percent of all nonprofits surveyed
had a separate audit committee. Not surprisingly, larger organizations were
more likely to have audit committees than smaller ones. Fifty-eight percent of
the larger organizations (who have revenues with more than $40 million in
annual expenses) had audit committees. In smaller organizations with annual
expenses of less than $100,000, only 20 percent reported having an audit
committee.
Most experts agree that an audit committee is a good practice. It sends the
message to your constituency and the public at large that the activities of
your nonprofit will always be honest and legal.
Using an independent accounting firm
An audit is a procedure where an independent accounting firm formally certi-
fies whether an organization’s financial statements have been prepared
according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
Some states have audit requirements for nonprofit organizations. However, if
the nonprofit has received federal funds (including entities that receive federal
funds that trickle through state or local government entities), they’re required
to comply with the audit requirements contained in the Office of Management
and Budget Circular No. A-133. This document was issued in response to the
Single Audit Act passed by Congress in 1990 to ensure that nonprofits that
receive federal funds comply with certain minimal audit procedures. It’s called
the Single Audit Act because it’s intended to provide uniform audit standards
for all the entities required to comply with it (instead of a patchwork of individ-
ual state standards). You can view a copy of the Office of Management and
Budget Circular No. A-133 (which explains the single audit requirements) at
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a133/a133.html.
142
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 

Most larger nonprofits voluntarily have their statements audited even if
states don’t require them to do so or they don’t receive federal funds. But,
because audit opinions are expensive (they require the organizations to pay
their auditors on an hourly basis to test and verify the information in the
financial statements), many nonprofits choose not to have their information
audited.
But, remember, if your organization doesn’t have independent auditors, the
role of the audit committee can be even more important, because the audit
committee is charged with making sure management has done its job with
respect to preparing accurate financial statements.
Developing audit committee standards
If you’re looking for guidance on developing standards and practices for an
audit committee, a good place to start is Section 301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act (SOX). Even though SOX doesn’t technically apply to nonprofits, it can
serve as an excellent model.
Three elements found in Section 301 of SOX are especially adaptable to and
useful for your nonprofit audit committee standards:
 Responsibility: SOX states that the audit committee should be directly
responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the
work of any registered public accounting firm. This responsibility helps
maintain the independence of management from the auditors who are
auditing the organization (and consequently the management’s actions).
 Resolving disputes: SOX requires audit committees to be responsible for
resolving disagreements between management and the accountants.
Disagreements can come up as to how various items are reflected and
reported on the financial statements, particularly if management’s com-
pensation is tied in any way to that of the organization (for example, a
bonus).
 Communicating with the auditors/accountants: SOX makes clear that
the audit committee is responsible for communicating directly with the
auditors or accountants and ensuring that management isn’t filtering the
information in an attempt to portray it as rosier than it really is.
Depending on the size and activities of your nonprofit organization, it may
hire an outside accounting firm to audit or review its financial statements and
books and records. A review of financial statements is a verification process
that’s less extensive than an audit and is undertaken when federal and state
law doesn’t require a formal audit.

Chapter 10: All About Audit Committees

Starting with a charter
A charter is a document that serves as a road map for an organization, and it
may include a mission statement and description of the organization’s con-
templated activities and details as to how these will be carried out (for exam-
ple, monthly meetings, written reports to the board, and so on). These
charters define the scope of authority of the audit committee and determine
who can sit on it.
Here are a few key elements to include in your audit committee’s charter:
 Purpose: The purpose and function of the audit committee needs to be
clearly spelled out. The role of the audit committee should be to ensure
the integrity of the company’s financial statements.
 Monitor compliance: The audit committee should monitor compliance
with legal and regulatory requirements, such as getting the organiza-
tion’s tax returns and annual reports filed.
 Ensuring that the accountants stay independent: Part of the role of the
audit committee is making sure that management and auditors don’t get
too chummy. A close relationship between these folks could compro-
mise the accountant’s objectivity in the event that he or she does find
some sloppy accounting practices on the part of management.
 Policies for fixing problems: The charter must address the audit commit-
tee’s policies with respect to notifying the entire board of a problem and
working with management to identify known risks and problems. Example
problems may include accounts that aren’t being properly monitored or
particular databases containing financial information that aren’t secure.
Interfacing with management
Regardless of whether an organization employs independent auditors, audit
committees are responsible for objectively evaluating the relationship of man-
agement with the accountants and auditors. The committee monitors the man-
agement’s effectiveness in providing auditors with the information needed to
determine whether the company’s financial statements are prepared in accor-
dance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Generally
Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), which are the professional standards to
which accounting and auditing firms are subject in performing their duties.
Audit committees should not get involved in performing audits; rather, they
should facilitate them. The internal audit committee provides an essential
objective interface between a company’s management and its independent
(outside) auditors to ensure that, at all times, the auditors’ opinions and cer-
tifications are based on full and accurate information about the company’s
operations.
144
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 

Audit committees are responsible for ensuring that the organization main-
tains a work environment that
 Enables auditors to perform necessary testing
 Encourages employees to come forward with issues that may be rele-
vant to the audit process (see the later section “Handling complaints”
for more details)
Audit Committee Membership Guidelines
In order to fully comply with SOX standards, an audit committee must be
established according to specific membership requirements. Members of the
audit committee are drawn from the nonprofit’s board of directors. These
independent directors (who have no financial interest in the company) may
be eligible to serve on the nonprofit’s audit committee if they meet the
requirements discussed in this section.
Independence is key
To ensure that audit committees are fair and objective advocates for effective
audit procedures, SOX requires audit committee members to be financially
independent from the company in two respects:
 Compensation: A committee member may not receive any type of com-
pensation or fee from the organization other than payment for serving
on the board of directors of the nonprofit. However, audit committee
members can be paid for providing accounting, consulting, legal, invest-
ment, banking, or financial advisory services to the nonprofit or for
working for companies that provide these services.
 Affiliation: A member can’t be affiliated with the company through
family or employment relationships. Unfortunately, SOX Section 302
doesn’t clearly define the term “affiliated person.” It merely states that if
you’re affiliated, you’re prohibited from serving on an audit committee.
However, the legislative history of SOX and past practices of the SEC
make it possible to determine who will be deemed an affiliated person
and thus ineligible to serve on your company’s audit committee.
For instance, the definition of the term “affiliated person” that’s used 
in most other sections of securities laws applies to SOX as well. Under
this definition, a director is considered to be an affiliated person if he 
or she has a direct or indirect influence over the management of the
company’s business or affairs other than solely by virtue of being a
director.
145
Chapter 10: All About Audit Committees

Figure in a financial expert
At least one person on a company’s audit committee should be a financial
expert. Generally, a person is a financial expert if he or she has, through edu-
cation and experience, an understanding of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (GAAP), financial statements, and internal accounting controls.
The SEC doesn’t consider former CEOs to be financial experts for companies
that are required to comply with SOX.
Serving on an Audit Committee
If you serve on a nonprofit’s board of directors and meet the requirements,
you very likely will be asked to serve on an audit committee. Doing so
involves more than simply rubber-stamping the company’s financials. For
starters, you’ll be asked to play a fairly active role in recruiting and deciding
how much to pay the company’s auditors. You’ll also be a go-to person within
the organization when financial issues arise.
Monitoring events and policing policies
The audit committee not only must be a nonprofit’s internal moral compass,
but it also must monitor external publicity and events that can impact the
audit process. It’s responsible for making sure that the nonprofit responds
appropriately.
Examples of what the audit committee is responsible for reviewing and moni-
toring include
 The annual audited financial statements and quarterly reports filed by
the nonprofit
 Press releases and financial information provided to the public
 Policies for risk management within the nonprofit
 Problems that occur during an audit as well as management’s response
to such problems
 The role and performance of the nonprofit’s internal auditors
 Changes in your nonprofit’s accounting policies
 Issues regarding internal controls and audit adjustments
 The policies and procedures of the audit committee itself
146
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 

Interfacing with the auditors
Using SOX as a model, the nonprofit’s audit firm must report solely to the
audit committee. This arrangement is a departure from pre-SOX days, when
auditors in private companies also reported to management on a variety of
issues. Congressional hearings on SOX revealed an inherent conflict in the
interaction between management and the auditors who were, in effect, evalu-
ating the effectiveness of management’s policies.
The audit committee is expected to prevent management from influencing
audit outcomes. SOX specifically states that the committee’s role includes
the resolution of disagreements between management and outside auditors
regarding financial reporting. Using the SOX model means that the audit com-
mittee must have a full understanding of events that affect the nonprofit and
the nonprofit’s operations in order to properly understand and resolve these
disputes.
Further, auditors are required to report the following information directly to
the audit committee:
 All critical accounting policies and practices to be used
 All alternative treatments of financial information within Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles that have been discussed with manage-
ment, the ramifications of using alternative disclosures and treatments,
and the treatment preferred by the auditor
 Any other material (significant) written communications between the
auditor and management, such as a management letter or schedule of
unadjusted differences
Preapproving nonaudit services
Private companies that are subject to SOX face strict rules about what
accounting services an independent audit firm can and can’t perform for a
company. Basically, Congress didn’t want auditors to be auditing their own
work. Any functions that the audit firm can’t perform under SOX must be sent
to another accounting firm, performed by an outside consultant, or handled
internally.
The audit committee has sign-off authority for audit services, which means
that it must authorize every accounting service the company’s audit firm pro-
vides, including confirmation letters and compliance with the financial
reporting requirements of regulatory agencies.
147
Chapter 10: All About Audit Committees

Your nonprofit audit committee may want to take a cue from SOX and discuss
under what circumstances it is okay for the audit firm to perform the follow-
ing services when doing an audit or review for your organization:
 Bookkeeping or other services related to accounting records or financial
statements
 Financial information systems design and implementation
 Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution-in-
kind reports
 Actuarial services
 Internal audit outsourcing services, management or human resources
functions
 Broker or dealer, investment advisor, or investment banking services
 Legal services or expert services unrelated to the audit
If a nonaudit service isn’t on this list, it’s permitted under SOX as long as the
audit committee approves the service before the audit firm provides it.
Handling complaints
Under SOX, private companies are required to have procedures in place for
handing complaints abut the companies accounting and audit procedures.
This is yet another “best practices” standard that many nonprofits are adopt-
ing voluntarily.
If you adopt theses standards, your audit committee is responsible for main-
taining policies about the disposition of complaints about the nonprofit. It’s
also required to have procedures in place for receiving confidential and
anonymous complaints by employees.
The audit committee serves as a resource for employees, management, and
auditors, as well as for the nonprofit’s constituency. With the complaint func-
tion, the audit committee complements whistle-blower provisions put forth
by SOX (see Chapter 13).
Considering CEO and CFO certifications
Managers of nonprofit organizations aren’t required to sign certifications
affirming the organization’s compliance with legal and regulatory require-
ments. However, this is a requirement of SOX, and some nonprofits are volun-
tarily following suit.
148
Part III: Structuring a Nonprofit to Meet Its Mission 

Under SOX, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer are required
to certify in annual and quarterly reports that they have disclosed the follow-
ing to the auditor and the audit committee:
 All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal controls that could adversely affect the nonprofit’s
ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data
 Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the nonprofit’s internal controls
Under SOX, an audit committee must make sure that any relevant information
gleaned from the certifications is brought to the attention of the audit firm.
Ferreting out improper influence
SOX Section 303 regulates the relationship between the audit committee, the
auditors, and management with a catch-all provision to discourage company
management from improperly influencing audits and auditors. SOX prohibits
officers and directors of public companies from fraudulently influencing,
coercing, manipulating, or misleading any outside auditor engaged in an audit
for the purpose of making the audited financial statements misleading. This is
a good practice for nonprofits to consider voluntarily adopting.
Rotating the audit partners
SOX requires public accounting firms to rotate certain individuals every five
years. This may be overkill for many nonprofit organizations, but it is one
that large organizations with high-stakes audits that are constant fodder for
the media attention may seriously consider.
This particular SOX standard requires rotation of the following individuals:
 The audit partner primarily responsible for a company’s audit
 The audit partner responsible for reviewing the audit
The audit committee is responsible for making sure that this rotation actually
happens.
149
Chapter 10: All About Audit Committees

Engaging advisors
Your audit committee may be involved in hiring more than just the auditors.
Under SOX, the committee must also have authority to engage independent
counsel and other advisors as it deems necessary to carry out its duties.
Under SOX, if a company doesn’t have a separately designated audit commit-
tee, it must state that the entire board of directors is acting as the audit com-
mittee. This is a standard to which the public will likely hold larger nonprofit
organizations, despite the lack of any formal legal requirements that apply
specifically to nonprofits.
At a minimum, your nonprofit should plan on disclosing the following in your
annual reports:
 Whether you have an audit committee
 Whether the members of the committee, if you have one, are indepen-
dent under the rules of the public stock exchanges

Some Special
Types of
Nonprofits

In this part . . . 
T

of organizations, ranging from small, unincorporated
associations and community groups to large private foun-
dations and cooperatives. This part gives you a rundown
of them all.

Chapter 11
Forming a Solid Foundation
In This Chapter
 Understanding the function of private foundations
 Exploring types of private foundations
 Satisfying the many legal requirements
 Choosing a board of directors to head up your foundation
P
rivate foundations are charitable organizations that don’t quite qualify as
public charities. They usually get their funds from a small group of
wealthy benefactors, while larger public charities get their funding from a
variety of sources.
Private foundations have some legal leeway when it comes to distributing
their money. They get tax-exempt status on all of their earnings, yet only have
to distribute a mere 5 percent of their capital each year toward their charita-
ble purpose. Those who establish private foundations are allowed very broad
discretion as to who receives their money, and they also don’t have to
release much information about what they’ve done. Public charities, on the
other hand, generally don’t have this level of autonomy or privacy.
According to the most recent Internal Revenue Service data, 76,348 private
foundations filed U.S. tax returns in 2003, and of these, 64,884 were grant-
making foundations. Grant-making foundations essentially are charities that
distribute money to other charities.
Although private foundations are charitable organizations, a different set of
rules apply to them. This chapter explains what these rules are and sheds
light on the differences between private foundations and public charities.
Why Form a Foundation?
If you’re wealthy, want to champion a charitable cause, and insist on some
degree of control over the charity, then a private foundation is the way for
you to go.

154
Part IV: Some Special Types of Nonprofits 
Keeping it all in the family
The overwhelming majority of private foundations are independent family
foundations that are run by the person who set up the foundation (or his or
her family members). They can do good things privately, and as long as they
follow the rules (mostly tax rules), the foundation can go about fulfilling its
mission in the manner its sees fit.
Maintaining privacy and control
Control and privacy are the two biggest reasons why rich people establish
private foundations. The cost of setting up and running a private foundation
is formidable, and if you’re just “sort of” rich, you might just consider making
an outright gift to your favorite charity (which may be an established private
foundation) to accomplish your purpose. However, if you have “serious
money” (think hundreds of thousands, millions, or hundreds of millions), set-
ting up your own private foundation is a practical way to accomplish philan-
thropic goals.
Drawing the legal lines between private
and public charities
The modern rules governing private foundations
came into being way back when Congress
passed the Tax Reform Act of 1969 and created
special rules to establish a presumption that
every tax-exempt charitable organization (think
public charity) would be considered a private
foundation unless it fell into one of the following
predefined categories:
 It is a traditional public charity, such as a
hospital, school, or medical research
organization.
 It is a publicly supported organization, such
as a youth program or a medical research
facility. This type of organization receives at
least one-third of its annual support from
the public through gifts, donations, and
membership dues.
 It is a supporting organization, which sup-
ports (and is significantly involved in) the
activities of a specific public charity. A
booster club that raises funds for a hospital
or treatment nonprofit is an example of a
supporting organization.
The lesson here is that if you’re thinking of start-
ing a private foundation to send your kids to col-
lege or take care of your dog after you die,
forget about it. To obtain recognition as a private
foundation from the IRS, you have to jump
through the same hoops as if you were applying
to be recognized as a public charity. So, the pur-
pose of the foundation must fall into one of the
same categories that the IRS would recognize
to grant public charity status (educational, reli-
gious, scientific, and so on).

Comparing Private Foundations
to Public Charities
You may not be aware of it, but public charities are all around you: They’re
hospitals, schools, universities, and more. Public charities often strive for vis-
ibility and recognition that buttresses their fundraising efforts.
155
Chapter 11: Forming a Solid Foundation
Some famous private foundations
The model for modern day private foundations
has its roots in the Gilded Age, after John
Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie amassed
large fortunes and chose to use their financial
influence to improve society. Carnegie had an
interest in building libraries (see the sidebar
“The captivating history of the Carnegie
Foundation” for more details); Rockefeller was
interested in areas such as education and med-
ical research.
The Rockefeller Foundation was established in
1913 (the same year that income tax was estab-
lished) by Rockefeller himself. Prior to establish-
ing his foundation, Rockefeller was already a
widely recognized philanthropist. At the turn of
the century, he gave $80 million to a small Baptist
college, transforming it into the University of
Chicago. He also founded the Rockefeller
Institute for Medical Research in New York City
(which is now known as Rockefeller University),
and he established the General Education Fund
in 1902 to promote nationwide education pro-
grams. The Rockefeller Foundation was funded
with $250 million. The Foundation provided the
endowment for the Johns Hopkins School of
Hygiene and Public Health and helped build the
Peking Union Medical College. It’s estimated that
over the course of his life, Rockefeller gave away
over $550 million. Remember this though: He 
was one of the very wealthiest men in history.
When he died in 1937, his remaining fortune was
estimated at $1.4 billion, and since that time no
other American (including Bill Gates or Sam
Walton) would come even near that.
Another famous foundation is the Ford family’s
Ford Foundation, which was established in 1936
and funded largely through bequests in the
1940s from Henry Ford and his son, Edsel. The
foundation’s board, chaired by Henry Ford II,
commissioned a study of how the foundation
should concentrate its future activities. The
resulting recommendations formed the charter
for the foundation’s modern-day mission, which
included strengthening democratic values,
reducing poverty and injustice, promoting inter-
national cooperation, and advancing human
achievement.
More recently, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates
and his wife Melinda (whose 2006 personal net
worth was estimated at $53 billion) founded the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000. Based
on the principle that all lives have equal value,
the foundation works to reduce inequality around
the world. The foundation is headquartered in
Seattle, Washington, and is led by co-chairs Bill
Gates and Melinda Gates as well as Bill’s father,
William H. Gates, Sr. Billionaire Warren Buffett
was so impressed by the work of the foundation
and by Bill Gates personally that he announced
that he would give approximately $30 billion of his
fortune to the foundation.

Generally, public charities have active fundraising programs and receive con-
tributions from a range of sources, including the general public, various gov-
ernmental sources, public and private corporations, and other public
charities and private foundations.
Public charities can earn income from conducting activities that further their
exempt purposes. For example, a public charity established as a workshop
for the blind can sell the goods it produces in furtherance of its exempt activ-
ity. (However, there are limitations on the activities public charities can per-
form that compete with the private sector, as discussed in Chapter 14.)
Public charities also can exist to raise funds for other charities.
In contrast to public charities, private foundations generally have the follow-
ing characteristics:
 Single funding source: Private foundations are established from a single
major source of funding (such as a gift from one family or corporation).
 Grant-making mission: Private foundations have a primary mission in
making grants to other charitable organizations and individuals (instead
of operating a charity or engaging in direct charitable functions).
 Low-key community presence: Private foundations are far less visible in
the community because they don’t raise funds from the public. In fact,
some private foundations make anonymous gifts to avoid constant solic-
itation from other nonprofits.
 Special tax hoops to jump through: Private foundations have extra fed-
eral tax filing and compliance requirements. Some rules apply to all types
of private foundations, and some rules apply only to certain types of pri-
vate foundations (and may well apply to other organizations as well).
The Types of Private Foundations
Private foundations come in different flavors, and the one you’ll like best will
be the one that matches your taste; that is, the one that fits your needs and is
most suited to accomplish the goals that you have in mind. The two main
classifications are private operating and grant-making (or non-operating)
foundations. Both types of foundations are discussed in this section.
Private operating foundations
Imagine for a moment that you’re eager to use some spare cash to set up a
program that helps out a particular charitable program. Suppose further that
156
Part IV: Some Special Types of Nonprofits 

you don’t really need any outside contributions to set up and run your pro-
gram. In this case, you’d want to establish a private operating foundation.
Private operating foundations usually don’t make grants to any outside orga-
nizations or individuals. They operate their own programs and often make
direct gifts to other needy causes and individuals, which are generally funded
from the income off of the return on investment from the original endowment
to set up the foundation.
Your organization will be classified as a private operating foundation if it uses
the majority of its resources to run its own charitable programs or to provide
its own charitable services.
So how do you know if you qualify? From a technical standpoint, you need
to spend at least 85 percent of your adjusted net income (that is, your gross
income minus allowable deductions) directly on conducting your exempt
activity.
The Internal Revenue Service calls this the income test, and it’s one of those
special hoops you must jump through in order to get recognized as a private
operating foundation. In addition, you must also meet one of the following
tests:
 Asset test: This test is met if 65 percent or more of your foundation’s
assets are devoted to conducting its exempt activity, and these assets
consist of corporate stock that’s controlled by the foundation.
 Endowment test: This test is satisfied if your foundation distributes at
least two-thirds of its minimum investment return directly in connection
with actively conducting its exempt activity.
157
Chapter 11: Forming a Solid Foundation
The David and Minnie Meyerson Foundation
The David and Minnie Meyerson Foundation is
a private operating foundation focusing on
children with physical disabilities. You can view
the foundation’s Web site at www.meyerson
foundation.org. The Meyerson Foundation
runs many of its own projects, which include
research on disability issues, the provision of
support to children with disabilities, and other
endeavors.
Another example of a private operating founda-
tion is the Synopsys Silicon Valley Science
Technology and Outreach Foundation, which
offers programs for teachers and training,
administrative support, and students interested
in developing science projects for competition.
The foundation conducts seminars and various
instructional activities for teachers. Check out
the foundation’s Web site at www.outreach-
foundation.org.

 Support test: This test has three parts, all of which must be met:
• At least 85 percent of your foundation’s support is normally
received from the general public or five or more unrelated exempt
organizations
• No more than 25 percent of your foundation’s support is normally
received from any single exempt organization
• No more than 50 percent of your foundation’s support is generated
through investment income
Sound confusing? It is. If you need to go anywhere near this level of detail,
suffice it to say that you need to work with an accountant or attorney to
make sure you don’t get stuck in one of the hoops you’re supposed to be
jumping through.
When you file an application for tax-exempt status for a new nonprofit organi-
zation, the IRS will presume your organization to be a private foundation
unless your organization meets one of the tests for non-operating private
foundation status.
Grant-making foundations
Suppose you love music and want to use your money to conduct free concerts
and other similar events that encourage the enjoyment and appreciation of

Part IV: Some Special Types of Nonprofits 
The history of the Carnegie Foundation
The Carnegie Corporation of New York is an
example of a high-profile grant-making founda-
tion. Created in 1911 by Andrew Carnegie, the
Carnegie Corporation of New York promotes
“the advancement and diffusion of knowledge
and understanding.” The foundation has an
extensive Web site at www.carnegie.org,
where you can read about the history and phil-
anthropic endeavors of the organization. The
site contains the biography of Andrew
Carnegie, born in Scotland in 1835, who immi-
grated with his family to the United States in
1848 and went to work as a bobbin boy in a
cotton mill at age 13. After trying his hand at a
number of different occupations, he established
his own business in 1865 and went on to form
the Carnegie Steel Company, which began the
Pittsburgh steel industry. At age 65, he sold the
Carnegie Steel Company to J.P. Morgan for $480
million, and from that point forward devoted his
life to philanthropic activities. One of his major
accomplishments was to establish free public
libraries so that everyone could have access to
self-education. Under his direction, over $56
million was spent to build 2,509 libraries in
English-speaking countries throughout the
world.

music. The thing is, you don’t have the time or inclination to develop or con-
duct specific programs, and there are a large number of charitable organiza-
tions actively endeavoring in these fields.
If this is your situation, you may want to consider establishing a grant-making
foundation, which is sometimes referred to as a private non-operating founda-
tion. This way, you can simply give your money to other charities that are
already doing what you’d like to do.
Grant-making foundations are entities that give money to other charitable
organizations instead of directly carrying out their own charitable activities.
If your organization isn’t a private operating foundation, it will more than
likely be classified as a grant-making foundation.
Establishing a Foundation: Time to Jump
Through Some Legal Hoops
When establishing a private foundation, you can either set it up as a trust or
a nonprofit corporation. However, with the heightened concern over legal lia-
bility and the fact that directors and officers of nonprofit corporations may
have some degree of protection from liability under state law, the corporate
form is most frequently used.
As discussed in Chapter 5, for an organization to qualify for tax-exempt status
as a charity, it needs to be organized for educational, scientific, religious, or
other special purposes.
Federal-level compliance
The first step to set up a nonprofit corporation is to prepare its articles of
incorporation or articles of organization. The IRS looks closely at these when
you ask it to grant you tax-exempt status. The IRS suggests that your soon-to-
be private operating foundation’s articles of organization include the follow-
ing provisions:
 Distribute money every year: You must have a clear statement that the
foundation will distribute its income for each of its tax years in a time
and manner so as not to be subject to any tax on undistributed income.
 Avoid self-dealing: Include a directive that the foundation will not
engage in any self-dealing (see the sidebar “Self-dealing is a big no-no” for
more details on this practice).
159
Chapter 11: Forming a Solid Foundation

 Distribute excess business holdings: Be sure to put in a requirement
that the foundation will not retain any excess business holdings (no
more than 20 percent of an interest in a business enterprise).
 Only make permitted investments: Include a prohibition that the foun-
dation will not make any investments that would jeopardize its charita-
ble purpose.
160
Part IV: Some Special Types of Nonprofits 
Self-dealing is a big no-no
If you’re the person who established a private
foundation, you are, by definition, what’s called
a disqualified person. If you’re a disqualified
person, you can’t engage in self-dealing. The
term self-dealing is generally used to describe
deals between a private foundation and a dis-
qualified person that involve one or more of the
following types of transactions:
 The sale or exchange of property: This
transaction between a private foundation
and a disqualified person is automatically
an act of self-dealing, even if unintentional.
For example, a disqualified person who’s a
medical supplies salesperson can’t make
any sales to his hospital’s private founda-
tion, regardless of the amount of the sale.
 Leases: Any lease between a disqualified
person and a private foundation is automat-
ically considered to be self-dealing.
 Extending credit or making loans: These
types of transactions between private foun-
dations and disqualified persons are acts of
self-dealing unless the loan is completely
interest-free.
 The provision of any goods, services, or
facilities (including office space, cars, sec-
retarial help, meals, parking, and so on):
These transactions between a private foun-
dation and a disqualified person is auto-
matically an act of self-dealing unless these
items are provided without charge and are
used exclusively for the exempt purpose of
the private foundation.
 The payment of any compensation or
expense reimbursement: This transaction
between a private foundation and a dis-
qualified person is considered to be self-
dealing unless the payment is for personal
services necessary to carry out the private
foundation’s mission and the payment isn’t
excessive.
 Transferring foundation income or assets
to, or for the use or benefit of, a disqualified
person: This transaction is automatically
considered an act of self-dealing.
 Certain agreements to make payments to
government officials: This transaction
would generally be considered an act of
self-dealing unless such payments are log-
ically excluded. For example, a prize doesn’t
have to be included in gross income if the
official receiving it is selected from the gen-
eral public. Similarly, a scholarship grant
would also be exempt.
If a case of self-dealing is egregious enough,
the tax-exempt organization could lose its tax-
exempt status. For example, if an officer of a
nonprofit enters into a lease agreement for the
headquarters of the organization that’s in a
building she owns, and the rent for the space is
way above market rent, this would constitute
self-dealing.

 Don’t make taxable expenditures: Include a statement that the founda-
tion will not make any taxable expenditures, such as spending cash
on prohibited political activities (for example, endorsing particular
candidates).
If you choose to establish a trust rather than a nonprofit corporation for your
foundation, the trust document needs to provide for substantially similar pro-
visions to the ones shown in the previous bulleted list.
State-level compliance
Our glorious Union is comprised of 50 states, all with slightly different rules
governing foundation activities. Your foundation must comply with the rules
of each state in which it carries out any activities. Fortunately, all 50 states
also share some certain similarities that make compliance a bit less arduous.
But learning the differences is important.
Scoping out the state requirements
The go-to place for figuring out what you have to do to satisfy the require-
ments of each state is the Web site of the National Association of State
Charity Officials at www.nasconet.org. This is the association of state
offices that are charged with the oversight of charitable organizations.
If your state requires you to register, it’s typically with the state’s taxing
authority, which generally also requires an inclusion of a copy of IRS Form
990-PF (see Chapter 7 for more on this form).
Your foundation may be required to follow the registration process of a given
state if your foundation operates within that state, solicits contributions
within that state’s borders, or is deemed to be doing business within the state.
“Doing business” may include soliciting contributions by mail or telephone,
conducting activities or programs, having employees, keeping a checking
account, or owning or renting a property in a particular state. The level of
connection your organization has with a particular state will determine
whether or not your private foundation is subject to that state’s filing
requirements.
If your private foundation solicits donations or contributions for charitable
purposes, you should also know that most states require you to register and
file periodic financial reports. Although many states accept a copy of your
IRS Form 990-PF to satisfy this reporting requirement, the foundation should
double-check the laws of each state in which it does business to ensure that
it’s following all the rules of each state in which it operates.
161
Chapter 11: Forming a Solid Foundation

Complying with some more complicated requirements
Not all states will be satisfied simply because your foundation has filed the
IRS Form 990-PF and registered with the state taxing authorities. Some states
require additional items of information, which may include the following:
 More financial statements: They may want to know the details for the
items you have reported on the other forms.
 Explanations about notes to financial statements: A state may ask you
about the footnotes in your financials or in the auditors’ reports.
 A report by an independent accountant: The state may not require a
full-fledged audit, but it may request a report confirming what’s reported
on your financial information.
As if all this wasn’t burdensome enough, each state may require the addi-
tional material to be presented on forms that they proscribe, or in specific
formats, even though it doesn’t need to be submitted with the private founda-
tion’s return as filed with the IRS.
If the required information isn’t provided to a particular state, or the state
determines that its form wasn’t completed properly, you can expect a terse
note asking you to provide the missing information or submit an amended
return.
If, for some reason, your private foundation finds itself in a position where it
needs to file an amended Form 990-PF with the IRS for a given year, you must
also send a copy of that amended return to any state that required a copy of
the original return. The deadline for filing Form 990-PF with the IRS generally
differs from the time for filing any similar reports or the Form 990-PF with the
various states.
Running Your Foundation
As with most businesses and nonprofit organizations, a private foundation is
usually headed up by a board of directors. The board provides management
and business oversight to the foundation, but it generally isn’t involved in the
day-to-day activities that are performed through the officers of the founda-
tion. The board is an experienced group of advisors that the foundation relies
on for long-term direction and strategy.
The foundation directors are usually selected based on their skill, experi-
ence, and ability to achieve the foundation’s mission. But they may also be
selected based on their relationship with the founder of the private founda-
tion. This means that they can be family members. The foundations may
compensate their directors, and many do. However, remember that the com-
pensation must be reasonable (and what’s reasonable to the IRS may not
seem reasonable to the director or the foundation!)
162
Part IV: Some Special Types of Nonprofits 

One of the functions of the board of directors is to set the compensation for
its officers. Compensation is usually set by comparing similar organizations
and by looking at their salary and benefits information that’s published on an
annual basis by the Council on Foundations (find out more about the Council
on Foundations at www.cof.org). Cost-of-living adjustments for the particu-
lar geographic region may also be appropriate.
For more information about selecting a board of directors and defining its
duties, see Chapter 8.
Terminating a Private Foundation
Not all foundations are forever. Some private foundations start out with a spe-
cific goal in mind, and when that goal is accomplished, the need for the foun-
dation ends. Other private foundations may grow in size or change directions
such that the private foundation form of operation may no longer be suitable
and public charity status may be desirable. Still other private foundations
may run out of money or worse yet, engage in transactions that aren’t suited
for tax exemption. Whatever the reason may be, there are situations where
private foundation status will terminate, either voluntarily or involuntarily —
both of which are explained in the following sections.
Giving it away
Imagine that you established a private foundation to end world hunger and
finally, after years of tireless efforts, you actually reach your goal. Now you
decide that it’s time to terminate your private foundation. Your private foun-
dation has several options: It can give any remaining assets it may have to a
public charity or another private foundation, or it can convert itself into a
public charity. It could also choose to merge with another private foundation
or split up into several private foundations.
Having it taken away
Suppose that your private foundation has failed to observe tax laws. After all
it’s your money, right? Right, but if you intentionally disregard the rules
through flagrant violations or willful failure to act appropriately, the IRS will
involuntarily terminate your private foundation. And to top it all off, you’ll be
socked with various sanctions and will have to pay a termination tax in an
amount equal to the foundation’s net assets. The take-away from this section
is to follow the rules!

ooperatives are a completely different kind of animal when it comes to
nonprofit organizations. In its simplest form, a cooperative is a group of
people who get together to help each other meet a common goal.
Cooperatives are jointly owned and democratically controlled entities.
Cooperatives exist in every industry in all geographic areas, and they exist
for the sole purpose of meeting their members’ needs. In a cooperative, any
profits (or margins as they’re called in the cooperative world) are returned to
the co-op’s members. These members, who may be individuals or businesses,
participate in the functioning of the cooperative. In the affairs of a coopera-
tive, each member of the co-op gets one and only one vote.
Co-ops are classified as nonprofit organizations because they return any
margin they make on the sale of goods or services to each member of the co-
op, much like a corporation pays out dividends to shareholders on its profits.
These refunds, sometimes called patronage dividends, are paid to each
member annually in proportion to each member’s percentage of business
done with the co-op for the year.
In this chapter, you can explore what a cooperative is, what its advantages
are, and what rules it must follow to gain tax-exempt status.

Cashing In on Collaboration:
How Cooperatives Work
In its simplest form, a cooperative is a collaboration of individuals or busi-
nesses that band together to gain a benefit through numbers. Many different
types of cooperatives exist, but they all have one similar goal: to operate at
lowered costs for the benefit of their members or others they do business
with (called patrons).
A cooperative isn’t a charitable organization, but it does operate on a non-
profit basis. And although cooperatives are similar in many ways to plain old
corporations, there are some key differences as to how cooperatives do busi-
ness. (We explain these key differences in the later section “Running a
Cooperative: Is It Any Different Than a Corporation?”.)
Banding together to meet 
business objectives
Cooperative organizations often exist to leverage their combined economic
strength in order to share and reduce selling costs. For example, members of
a marketing cooperative band together to deliver their products to the coop-
erative, which in turn sells the products to a particular market. Grape grow-
ers may form a cooperative to sell tons of grapes to wineries, retailer grocers,
or juice companies.
Members of a distribution cooperative purchase services from the cooperative
in order to distribute to customers. For example, a telecommunications coop-
erative may purchase bulk, long-distance telephone service and sell it back to
members who then make it available to their customers.
Buying and selling in bulk
Purchasing in bulk provides an opportunity to get goods and services at a
greater discount than may otherwise be available to individual businesses.
Cooperatives operate on a nonprofit basis, so buying and selling goods and
services through a cooperative assures the cooperative members that they
aren’t being charged a markup by a middleman.
Selling in bulk allows service providers and producers of goods and agricul-
ture the assurance that there will be a market for their goods and services. It
also ensures that a fair price will be negotiated on their behalf by their
cooperative.
166
Part IV: Some Special Types of Nonprofits 

Making a margin for the members
The term “profit” is frowned upon in cooperative parlance. Instead, the term
margin is used to describe what’s left over after accounting for the selling
costs, operating expenses, and capital needs of the cooperative. At the close
of each year, the cooperative generally distributes the margin for that year to
members. How much of the annual margin each member gets is determined
on a pro-rata basis, which is determined by how much business each
member did with the cooperative during that year.
For example, if a member grocery store bought 50 percent of all of the dairy
products sold by the Fresh Cheese Cooperative during 2007, the store would
receive a distribution of 50 percent of the margin paid out by the Fresh
Cheese Cooperative from its 2007 business. This is what’s meant by the
requirement that a cooperative must operate at cost.
Categorizing Cooperatives
Even though cooperative organizations are nonprofit enterprises, they differ
from the traditional notion of what a nonprofit is. This is because their basic
function is to provide economic utility to their members, as opposed to serv-
ing some sort of charitable, religious, or social motive. That said, the func-
tions of a cooperative are practically limitless. This section describes a
handful of cooperative types.
167
Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Cooperatives
Tracing the concept of cooperation
The concept of running a business on a coop-
erative basis has been around for centuries. In
fact, historians have found evidence of cooper-
ative organizations among cultures in early
Greece, Egypt, Rome, and Babylon.
Modern-day cooperatives follow a set of rules
that originated with the Rochdale Society of
Equitable Pioneers in Rochdale, England. The
Rochdale Society was established by a group of
textile weavers who had lost their jobs due to
automation within the textile industry. The three
primary modern-day principles of cooperatives
derived from the Rochdale Society include the
following:
 Subordination of capital (which makes
funding of the cooperative unimportant as
far as control is concerned)
 Allowing each person one vote regardless
of their percentage of cooperative owner-
ship
 Dividing profits among the members
according to the percentage of business
done with the cooperative organization for
the year

Consumer cooperatives
The consumer cooperative is one where members band together to realize
economies of scale in purchasing or in competing. Some organizations follow
a horizontal form of integration where cooperative stores band together to
increase their ability to compete with large box retailers (for example, com-
bined advertising campaigns by independently owned hardware stores
aiming to compete with the Home Depots of the world).
Other consumer cooperatives follow a vertical method of integration so that
they can benefit as a group in wholesale or even manufacturing activities. An
example of this would be a large-scale grocery cooperative that purchases
and warehouses food items and also produces private brand-label merchan-
dise to compete with the name brand products.
A primary goal of consumer cooperatives is member participation and con-
trol. Ideally, the member-owners periodically meet to set policies and elect
directors. Directors then hire management to run the cooperative on a day-
to-day basis.
Housing and condominium cooperatives
Cooperative housing apartments came into vogue in the late 1920s as an eco-
nomical way for housing ownership or proprietary leasing arrangements in
urban areas where housing was an issue. The concept gained substantial
popularity when federal mortgage insurance was extended to cover these
arrangements. And beginning in 1960, almost every state in the United States
adopted some form of law regarding condominium cooperatives.
The practical difference between condominium ownership and membership
in a condominium cooperative is that a cooperative member has no direct
ownership of real estate. Instead, he or she simply owns a cooperative share
or membership certificate. The modern trend is to use cooperative housing
law for homes and self-standing dwellings in a neighborhood development
where real estate is owned, but rules are maintained for how things are done.
Plus, the costs for maintaining streets, street lights, and common areas are
shared.
Electric, telephone, and 
utility cooperatives
One of the most successful areas of cooperative development has been in the
area of rural electric service. In the mid 1930s, only 10 percent of farms and
168
Part IV: Some Special Types of Nonprofits 

agri-businesses were receiving electrical services from a centralized electrifi-
cation system. In the 20 years that followed, more than 4 million farms were
connected to lines furnished by rural electric cooperatives. This was largely
due to financing programs made available through the Rural Electrification
Association, or REA, which is now known as the Rural Utilities Service. In
1949, the REA began a similar financing program for rural telephone coopera-
tives. Even though telephone co-ops had been around since the 1920s, the
REA established a financing program for these entities beginning in 1949, and
they, too, have become extremely important in the fabric of rural America.
These utility-based cooperatives are often themselves members of larger
cooperatives. For example, the National Rural Electric Cooperative
Association is a cooperative organization whose members are smaller elec-
tric cooperatives throughout the United States. The National Telephone
Cooperative Association is a similar organization made of rural telephone
cooperative associations.
Health cooperatives: Nothing to sneeze at
Cooperatives can serve to provide better and less expensive healthcare ser-
vices through value purchasing and obtaining preferred pricing on services
by forming healthcare cooperatives. In these types of cooperatives, doctors
typically furnish services on a fixed-fee basis, or by becoming employees of
the cooperative. In the healthcare industry, the cooperative form of organiza-
tion has been used to provide hospital and medical care, dental care, and
care in other areas of specialization.
169
Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Cooperatives
From cooperative to DIRECTV
In the mid 1980s, a cooperative called the
National Rural Telecommunications Cooperative
(NRTC) was formed largely through the efforts
of Bob Phillips, who was a visionary lawyer from
Kansas with a background in rural electric
cooperatives. Phillips saw an unfilled need for
the provision of television, video, and other
related services to portions of rural America
that cable television could or would not serve.
In the early stages of the cooperative, Phillips
was able to form a cooperative member-
ship consisting primarily of rural electric and 
telephone cooperatives. The NRTC partnered
with a little-known satellite venture to test and
validate the concept of a commercially distrib-
uted satellite television service for rural
American households as an alternative to cable
television. That venture is today known as
DIRECTV. Following on the success of that ven-
ture and in furtherance of its core mission,
NRTC continues to seek out, develop, and
deliver the latest available technology in the
telecommunications area to its membership,
who in turn acts as local distributors of these
various service offerings.

Marketing as a cooperative
Following the Great Depression, incentives abounded for the formation and
development of agricultural marketing cooperatives. These incentives included
the ability to bring products to market through a central repository at cost so
that any profits would be returned to the members of the cooperative. Since
those early days of development, the marketing cooperative has broadened
in scope to include any type of marketing that’s used to produce economic
goods (for example, fishermen banding together to market their catches).
This collective form of marketing provides real and immediate benefits to
both the producers and the public. Such cooperatives reduce transportation
and handling and merchandising costs, and they realize economies of scale in
conducting advertising campaigns and avoiding middleman markups. These
efficiencies in service and reduction on costs help benefit the public through
lowered retail costs and increased availability of popular products.
Purchasing cooperatives
The cooperative form of purchasing has as its primary goal the reduction of
member costs in the acquisition of goods and services. Purchasing coopera-
tives can be either consumer-oriented or business-oriented. Business pur-
chasing cooperatives help their members obtain a higher profit when dealing
with third parties, whereas consumer-based purchasing cooperatives strive
to provide goods and services at cost to their members. Use of the term “pur-
chasing” in the context of this type of cooperative should be broadly con-
strued because many purchasing cooperatives don’t in fact make any
purchases. Instead, they simply arrange for the delivery of goods or services
to their members, much like an agent might function to purchase goods for
its principal. Typical industries that use purchasing cooperatives include gro-
cery, drug, and hardware retailers.
Workers’ cooperatives
Workers’ cooperatives are usually composed of a group of workers who band
their resources together to operate a business in which they work. In the con-
text of workers’ cooperatives, the term “worker” includes all forms of labor
and professions, from plywood manufacturers to physicians. This form of
cooperative organization is popular in Europe, but much less so in the United
States.
170
Part IV: Some Special Types of Nonprofits 

Financial cooperatives
Financial institutions may also function on a cooperative basis. Credit unions,
mutual savings banks, and savings and loan associations can all be forms of
financial cooperatives. These forms of cooperatives enable patrons to borrow
or save under equitable terms that may be difficult to obtain at traditional
institutions.
Such organizations also may be formed to primarily serve other coopera-
tives. For example, the National Cooperative Finance Corporation is a primary
facilitator of funding for rural electric cooperatives in need of capital for
system maintenance and expansion.
Members Only: Who Can Be 
Part of a Cooperative?
In many cases, membership in a cooperative is closed, or restricted. These
membership limitations are sometimes imposed by state or other laws, but
they’re also often determined by those establishing the cooperative. If a
person wants to join the cooperative, he or she must meet all the necessary
requirements and go through an application and approval process.
Depending on the type of cooperative and the state of its incorporation, state
law may restrict who can be admitted as a member. For example, some states
preclude a for-profit corporation from becoming a member of a cooperative.
The Web site findlaw.com provides access to the laws of many (but not all)
states, and it shows the cooperative provisions if a given state’s statutes
reveal the limitations that the state places on cooperatives.
Some cooperatives may permit dealings with nonmembers on a cooperative
basis. These nonmember patrons may obtain the benefits of the cooperative
association, including the annual payment of patronage dividends. However,
they’re restricted from the right to vote and inspect the books and records of
the cooperative. They’re restricted from other rights that belong to full mem-
bers as well. Cooperatives may do business with nonmembers for a variety of
reasons (they’re too numerous to list here), but nonmembers never have the
same rights and privileges as members.
Many cooperatives also deal with the general public as well as their own
member-patron base, separately tracking the revenue from each segment of
consumer so that the cooperative aspect of operation at cost can be accu-
rately documented and accounted for. Examples of these types of coopera-
tives include Ace Hardware, Ocean Spray, Land O’Lakes, and other household
names.
171
Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Cooperatives

Certain types of cooperatives can lose their tax-exempt status if they do too
much business with nonmembers or derive too much income from sales that
aren’t related to their primary purpose. For example, rural electric coopera-
tives will lose their tax exemption for any year in which they earn more than
15 percent of their gross income.
Just as cooperatives have stockholders and partnerships have partners,
cooperatives have members. Cooperatives may be either stock or non-stock
organizations.
Collaborating for Tax Benefits
When a cooperative operates at cost by distributing its annual margin, it pays
no tax on those distributions. Rather, it’s a transparent entity as far as the IRS
is concerned. This provides a direct tax benefit to the cooperative’s mem-
bers. Unlike a corporation, which gets its distributed income tax twice (once
at the corporate level and then again at the shareholder level), cooperatives
don’t pay any income tax on their distributions of margins to members.
Members who receive the distributions may be taxed on the income, if
they’re taxable entities. If they’re tax-exempt, any patronage dividend distrib-
utions they receive generally aren’t taxable to them.
Distributing the dividends: Cash
and equity credits
Corporations distribute dividends, sometimes in the form of additional stock,
but generally in the form of cash. Cooperative distributions of margin can
also be in equity credits. Equity credits are undistributed profits or margin,
shared by cooperative members on the same basis as the distributions would
be. However, in order to qualify for tax-free distributions, at least 20 percent
of any margin distribution must be paid out in cash. Equity credits are some-
times referred to as patronage capital.
Any portion of margin that isn’t paid out in cash is still includable in the
income of the member entitled to the amount as an equity credit. This
retained equity is used by the cooperative for capital expenditures, growth,
and other business purposes. Equity credits can be converted to cash by the
cooperative on a set basis, or at the general discretion of the cooperative’s
board of directors when the financial health of the cooperative justifies a
redemption.
172
Part IV: Some Special Types of Nonprofits 

Many cooperatives have an equity redemption or rotation plan in place so
that each member knows when to expect to receive cash for the full value of
the accumulated equity certificates. State law generally allows the coopera-
tive to choose its method of redemption.
Special requirements for special types
of cooperatives
Certain types of cooperatives receive special tax treatment by the govern-
ment and are subject to stricter operating standards on what they can and
can’t do. For example, farmers’ cooperatives can’t do more than 50 percent of
their business with any single member. Rural electric cooperatives that dis-
tribute electricity to rural America can’t make more than 15 percent of their
income from sources unrelated to their primary purpose of generating or dis-
tributing electricity.
Cooperatives that don’t get any special treatment generally aren’t subject to
these limits. However, only income generated in pursuit of the cooperative’s
purpose is eligible for distribution as margin. In other words, income gener-
ated from an activity that’s completely unrelated to the cooperative’s pur-
pose is taxed at the normal income tax rate for corporations.
Forming a Cooperative in Five Easy Steps
Like corporations, cooperatives are creatures of state law, and the steps in
forming a cooperative are very similar to forming a corporation. The follow-
ing sections guide you through the process.
Step one: Check your state’s statutes
The first step in forming a cooperative is to form a corporation under your
state’s cooperative state statutes. The law of your particular state may say
that its general corporate laws will apply, or there may be a separate provision
for cooperative formation. Forming a cooperative corporation usually begins
with filing the articles of organization with your state’s secretary of state.
Certain types of federally regulated cooperatives (such as rural electric coop-
eratives) may have additional or special state requirements.
173
Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Cooperatives

Step two: File articles of incorporation
In order to file articles of incorporation, states usually require the incorpora-
tors to be listed, and more often than not the list will constitute the coopera-
tive’s first board of directors. So, you have to identify these individuals.
These folks will also likely be the first members of the cooperative. If you
don’t have any members yet, you need to round up some people (preferably
who work in the industry) that your cooperative will be serving. Then get a
board of directors in place.
Step three: Adopt some bylaws
State cooperative statutes will tell you what must be included in your bylaws
and what may be included. “Must-haves” vary slightly from state to state and
generally include things such as the establishment of a class (or classes) of
members, a reserve fund, an educational fund, and a limit on the membership
interest to one vote per member (regardless of how important the member
might be to the operations of the cooperative). “May-haves” generally include
things such as who should be admitted as a member, whether dues are
payable, what the cost of a membership certificate should be, whether a
patronage equity redemption plan is feasible, what classes of membership
are needed, and other such rules.
Step four: Make some rules and policies
You need to establish rules and policies for member dues, admission, with-
drawal, expulsion, meeting protocols, and other details that may not be
addressed or completely clarified in the bylaws. And you need to acquire
members (if you don’t already have them). In most cases, a cooperative is
formed out of the need of a group of similarly situated people or businesses,
and so a membership base is usually readily identifiable.
Step five: Issue member shares 
and certificates
As the grand finale in the formation of your cooperative, you want to issue
member shares or certificates. Each member is issued only one share at a
nominal cost as evidence of membership. To complete the formation process,
hold an organizational meeting of the members to vote on preliminary mat-
ters, such as who will be the cooperative’s first set of officers and directors.
174
Part IV: Some Special Types of Nonprofits 

Running a Cooperative: Is It Any
Different Than a Corporation?
To the outsider, the operation of a cooperative is similar to the operation of a
for-profit corporation. In fact, the average consumer would not be able to dis-
tinguish a cooperative organization from a for-profit corporation.
For example, from a legal perspective, cooperatives (like corporations) hold
regular meetings of the board and the members, and they elect their officers
and board members. From the standpoint of operations, goods are purchased
and sold, the cooperative enters into contracts and can be sued, and it per-
forms other functions just like a corporation. In fact, unless some specific
legal provision exists, cooperatives and their officers, directors, and agents
don’t enjoy the same types of state and federal exemptions from liabilities
that are bestowed on charitable nonprofits.
A major distinguishing characteristic between corporations and cooperatives
is that a cooperative needs to keep meticulous records of its dealings with its
members so that it can accurately distribute its margin after the close of each
fiscal year. The following sections show the other major distinctions between
corporations and cooperatives.
Profit distribution
Cooperatives operate at cost, returning all of their net profit (or margin) to
their members at the end of each year in an amount proportionate to the
amount of business each member did with the cooperative. In other words, if
you don’t do business with the cooperative, you don’t get a share of its
margin. Conversely, with a corporation that operates on a for-profit basis,
dividends are paid at a set rate per share, and the amount of dividends paid
to any one shareholder depends solely on the number of shares owned. And
shareholders don’t need to do business with a for-profit business in order to
earn a share of the company’s profits.
Share transfer restrictions
Unlike in a corporation, a membership share or certificate in a cooperative is
generally not freely transferable. Members usually must get permission from
the cooperative’s board of directors in order to transfer a membership share
certificate, and the board has the power to say no. When a for-profit share-
holder calls it quits and decides to sell shares to cash out, he or she usually
175
Chapter 12: Capitalizing on Cooperatives

gets cash. Not so with a terminating or withdrawing cooperative member,
who may need to wait years or even decades in order to redeem his or her
equity credits.
The reason for this is at the root of the cooperative philosophy: cooperatives
are formed for the benefit of members and to operate at cost, and the equity
credits retained from distributions of margin are used for capital investment
for the benefit of all members. Redemption of equity credit will generally not
be made unless it is clear to the cooperative’s board that the enterprise will
not suffer any economic harm or otherwise be financially jeopardized by the
redemption.
The Typical Operations of a Cooperative
The day-to-day operations of a cooperative don’t vary much from those of
corporations in similar enterprises. There’s no set formula on how opera-
tions should be conducted. However, because the nature of cooperatives
varies so widely, the question of whether the cooperative operates as an
agent or independent enterprise is one that frequently arises.
Cooperatives that act as an agent, bargaining on behalf of their members
(such as a marketing cooperative), receive products from the members, sell
them on behalf of the members, and return the proceeds of the sales to those
members. In contrast, a cooperative that acts as an independent enterprise
may purchase products from the membership, and then sell them just as if
they had been purchased from any ordinary enterprise. In the real world, a
variation or combination of these approaches is generally found in each and
every cooperative.
However, there are examples of cooperatives that act strictly as agents or
strictly as independent enterprises. For example, a housing cooperative is
generally organized to issue membership certificates along with leases
between the cooperative and its members. The member gets a membership
interest in a proprietary lease, which is generally not thought of by the
member as an ownership in an independent enterprise. Instead, it’s thought
of as a landlord/tenant relationship where the cooperative has the right to
evict the member if the member doesn’t pay the rent. In any event, if there’s a
problem with housing cooperatives, everything still comes down to what the
lease says.
In day-to-day operations, the relationship of a cooperative to its members
depends on the industry, the function of the cooperative, and the member
composition itself. The diversity of these organizations runs the gamut.
176
Part IV: Some Special Types of Nonprofits 

Dealing with Some Cooperative
Conundrums
While the operations of cooperatives appear to be nearly identical to those of
corporations, the types of issues that co-ops face are unique. Cooperatives,
for instance, don’t have to deal with hostile takeover attempts, minority
shareholder issues, or securities fraud. But, because cooperatives involve
people, people-related issues will crop up.
For example, you may come across pushy members who have agendas that
are counter to the good of the group. Every so often, a cooperative may get a
complaint from a member that there’s some sort of unfair treatment going on.
The member may want to be on the board of directors, may want to force the
cooperative to redeem outstanding equity credits, or may accuse the cooper-
ative of not distributing enough margin.
These problems can cause real headaches and be disruptive to cooperative
management. In order to resolve these issues, the cooperative generally tries
to appease the unhappy member by working within its powers to give exem-
plary service or special attention to the squeaky wheel. Unfortunately that
doesn’t always work, and the member can sue the cooperative.
One common situation is where an electric cooperative serves a local busi-
ness, and the owner of the business dies, holding a large amount of equity
credits. The widow of the business owner approaches the cooperative and
says “Hey, my spouse is now dead, and I have no use for these equity credits.
Please cash me out.” But depending on the financial health of the cooperative
and whether a set redemption cycle is in place, the cooperative’s board of
directors generally holds the sole discretion to decide whether to cash out
the widow or make her wait.
When the widow is told to wait and she sues the cooperative, the court will
first look to the cooperative’s governing documents and state law to see if the
widow wins. If the cooperative’s bylaws or state laws don’t require redemp-
tion on death, the poor widow is out of luck if the cooperative board tells her
to wait. This woman is out of luck because the court system doesn’t want to
get involved in the decisions that boards make. This business judgment rule
protects the decision of the board. The court system will not second-guess
decisions made by the board of directors, who sit in the best position to
make such judgment calls.
In order to avoid such headaches, your cooperative is well-advised to adopt
policies and procedures to address issues that have a tendency to reoccur on
a regular basis. That way, an officer or board member of a cooperative can
point to the policy and hopefully quell any opposition to an unpopular posi-
tion or decision.

Part IV: Some Special Types of Nonprofits 
Some famous cooperatives
You may not realize it, but many cooperatives
are household names. For example, you proba-
bly shop at some of these cooperatives, or
maybe you have one of their products in your
home. Here are just a few examples:
 Ace Hardware: Ace Hardware is a market-
ing cooperative that was founded in
Chicago in 1924. It’s currently the largest
global retailer-owned cooperative with
more than 4,800 stores located in 50 states
and 70 countries. Its trade name ranks
among the most widely recognized in
America. The members of this type of coop-
erative are the hardware stores them-
selves, who purchase goods and services
from the cooperative.
 Ocean Spray: Ocean Spray is an agricul-
tural cooperative that was formed in 1930 by
three cranberry growers who wanted to
expand the market for cranberries. One of
its members was an attorney and cranberry
grower named Marcus L. Urann. In 1930,
Urann invented a cranberry sauce with a
long shelf life along with cranberry juice
drinks. Ocean Spray was also one of the
first U.S. producers to use paper bottles,
which are now a mainstay in every grocery
store juice aisle.
 Land O’Lakes: Land O’Lakes, Inc. has been
around since 1921. It was first known as
the Minnesota Cooperative Creameries
Association. In 1924, set for market expan-
sion, it decided it needed a trademark and
brand name for its butter. Land O’Lakes,
a tribute to Minnesota’s sparkling lakes,
was chosen. The popularity of the name
took off, and in 1926 the cooperative
changed its corporate name to Land
O’Lakes Creameries, Inc., and later to Land
O’Lakes, Inc.
Land O’Lakes is currently one of America’s
premiere farmer-owned cooperatives and
offers farmers, local cooperatives, and cus-
tomers across the country a large line of
agricultural supplies as well as art produc-
tion and business services.

In This Chapter
 Getting familiar with the key provisions of SOX
 Applying SOX standards to nonprofits
 Migrating sensibly toward full SOX compliance
 Taking the SOX quiz
T
he Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) was signed by President George W. Bush
(with a huge wave of bipartisan support) in 2002 following two of the
biggest corporate downfalls in history. Enron, the nation’s largest energy
company, and Worldcom, the largest telecommunications company, both
filed bankruptcy mere weeks after receiving strong endorsements from stock
analysts and clean bills of health from their chummy auditors. Shareholders
across the nation screamed fraud, and because of this downfall, thousands of
retirees lost their pensions. Since its passage, SOX has changed the way both
for-profit and nonprofit businesses conduct themselves.
Although SOX doesn’t apply specifically to nonprofits, nonprofit organiza-
tions of all sizes are striving to comply with its standards (or are at least
becoming aware of them). This is because nonprofits must be prepared 
to demonstrate a commitment to good governance and so-called “internal
control” over their financial reporting practices. Nonprofits, as a rule, depend
on public good will and their squeaky-clean reputations to attract funds. So,
needless to say, despite the organization’s most altruistic motives, a financial
scandal can permanently undermine its ability to attract contributions. Even
before SOX came along, SOX-related words, such as “accountability,” “ethics,”
“transparency,” “duty,” “full-disclosure,” and “social responsibility” were part
of the vernacular of nonprofit governance.

A Quick and Clean Overview 
of Sarbanes-Oxley
The rationale for passing SOX was to ensure the integrity of the financial
statements on which the American public relies. Amazingly enough, each 
provision in the Act tracks to an event or abuse that occurred at a single 
for-profit company: Enron (see the sidebar “What went wrong at Enron” for
details). The implications of SOX are staggering, and it will be years before
they’re fully understood. In fact, SOX has been used to justify countless data
management and internal “security” projects having little or nothing to do
with financial statements, but the law was not passed to deal with these 
unrelated issues.
For private companies, SOX goes where the federal government has never
gone before. Although federal regulation of the sale of securities to protect the
public is nothing new, SOX goes beyond simply prohibiting deceptive conduct
and misrepresentations — it actually tells corporations how they must run
their businesses. For nonprofits, which aren’t technically subject to the man-
dates of SOX, the law has become the gold standard for good governance.
SOX defines specific duties for employees and board members and dictates
the structure of boards of directors. It even tells corporations subject to it
how they have to conduct their day-to-day operations.
182
Part V: Legal Landmines 
What went wrong at Enron
Nonprofit organizations need to understand the
events at Enron (which was the largest bank-
ruptcy in history at the time) in order to under-
stand what Congress was trying to address
regarding private corporations. Understanding
why SOX was passed can allow your organiza-
tion to determine which concerns can be rele-
vant to its financial reporting.
In the case of Enron, a handful of executives
had paid themselves millions in bonuses and
had profitably sold their own stock. Employees
were prohibited from selling their Enron stock
as its value plummeted because of a routine
blackout period. During congressional investi-
gations, it came to light that billions of dollars in
losses had been kept off the books by hiding
them in flimsy partnerships for which the chief
financial officer (CFO) received huge commis-
sions for forming. Amazingly, the board of direc-
tors had approved both the partnership
transactions and the commissions to CFO
Andrew Fastow (who later had to return the
money and got five years in prison).
Major credit reporting agencies failed to iden-
tify the events leading up to the collapse of
Enron. Moody’s Investors Service, Standard &
Poor’s Corporation, and Fitch Rating Services all
gave Enron good credit ratings a mere two and
a half months prior to Enron filing for Chapter 11
bankruptcy.

Four squeaky-clean SOX objectives
In the months subsequent to the Enron collapse, no less than two dozen SOX-
related bills were proposed in Congress. And President Bush announced his
183
Chapter 13: Existing in a World of Sarbanes-Oxley
The following omens that foreshadowed Enron’s
implosion are also present today in many non-
profit organizations:
 Successive resignations of key manage-
ment: On August 14, 2001, Enron CEO Jeff
Skilling resigned after being in the position
only six months. On October 16, 2001, coin-
ciding with a huge restatement of third-
quarter earnings, Enron announced that its
CFO, Andrew Fastow, would also be
replaced. SOX now requires corporations to
report changes in management within four
days after they occur.
Many nonprofits have equally tumultuous
turnover. For this reason, Senator Charles
Grassley demanded an investigation into
the abrupt departure of the Red Cross CEO
earlier this year (as discussed in Chapter 3).
 Inaccurate and unreliable financial state-
ments:
On October 16, 2001, Enron
announced third-quarter earnings that
reflected an unexpected $544,000 earnings
change and a $1.2-million change in stock-
holders’ equity (the value of the stockhold-
ers’ interest in the company). On November
8, 2001, Enron further announced that it
needed to restate its financial statements for
the first and second quarters of 2001 and for
the four years prior, 1997 through 2000. The
grand total of overstated income was $586
million. This disaster was attributed largely
to the fact that the financial statements were
audited by accounting firms that were down-
right chummy with the management that
they were supposed to be auditing.
Many nonprofits aren’t required to have
audited financial statements, and no rules
regulate the independence of their auditors
when they do.
 Off-balance-sheet transactions to hide
losses: A big factor in Enron’s eventual col-
lapse was the use of so-called special pur-
pose entities,
which were separate
companies set up to hide Enron losses. This
arrangement ensured that the losses didn’t
see the light of day on Enron’s books.
Instead, the losses showed up on the state-
ments of the special purpose entities.
Nonprofits are vulnerable to similar type of
manipulation because organizations often
have multiple separately balanced funds for
different programs. Improperly allocating
program funds caused the Red Cross to
earn a rebuke from Senator Grassley after
funds earmarked for 911 were shifted to
other programs.
 Lack of clear document destruction poli-
cies: On January 10, 2002, Enron’s audit firm,
Arthur Andersen admitted to Congress that
it had destroyed or shredded an undis-
closed number of documents related to
Enron’s use of special purpose entities to
hide losses and related matters. At the time,
no one within Andersen questioned or took
steps to stop the shredding.
Nonprofits often rely on volunteer adminis-
trative staff or staff members who are paid
less than the going rate. Without document
retention policies to guide these volunteers
and staff members, valuable information
can inadvertently be lost or easily obscured.

own ten-point plan. The following objectives emerged from the extensive 
testimony, press conferences, and thick packets of proposed legislation 
and protracted hearings that ensued:
 Make management accountable. Several provisions of SOX seek to
ensure that management, accountants, and attorneys are held directly
accountable for information that makes it onto a company’s financial
statements on their watches.
 Enhance disclosure. SOX’s provisions address the fact that several key
events and relatively shocking transactions having to do with corporate
scandal escaped scrutiny simply because they weren’t required to be
disclosed to the public.
 Conduct regular reviews. SOX requires the SEC to look at companies
more often and more closely. This new requirement is a reaction to the
SEC’s declining to review Enron’s records for several years preceding its
bankruptcy filing and consequential loss to investors.
 Make accountants accountable. SOX seeks to purge the accounting
industry of the conflicts of interest, financial self-dealing, and plain old
poor judgment that placed the investing public at risk when relying on
“certified” financial statements.
The major provisions of SOX
In for-profit and nonprofit organizations alike, financial reporting problems
can trigger serious and tragic consequences for investors. For this reason,
SOX focuses on how for-profit companies arrive at the financial information
they report to shareholders. Similarly, nonprofit stakeholders (donors, fund-
ing sources, and program recipients) need to know that the financial informa-
tion that’s reported on a nonprofit Form 990 is accurate. (IRS Form 990 is a
combined tax return and financial statement for nonprofit organizations. You
can read more about this form in Chapter 7.) Sox also sets standards for man-
agement, directors, attorneys, and auditors accountable for the end product.
This section explains the most important provisions of SOX.
Clamping down on auditors
An audit isn’t necessarily an adversarial process, but it’s supposed to be an
objective one. An audit is a process of verifying information and identifying
information that isn’t consistent with Generally Accepted Accounting
Standards, or GAAS. One purpose of an audit is so that accountants can 
certify financial statements that are prepared in accordance with Generally
Accepted Accounting Standards (GAAP); certification assures anyone who
reviews them that the statements are GAAP-compliant.
To remove any potential for funny business, SOX addresses the important
issue of auditors becoming too chummy with the clients that they’re auditing.
184
Part V: Legal Landmines 

Accounting firms, like any service company, have a financial incentive to
cater to clients who pay their fees. For example, a tense audit could strain
the client relationship and result in the accounting firm getting fired. This
potential for conflict of interest is exacerbated if the accounting firm provides
other lucrative services to the client besides the audit.
Accordingly, SOX Section 201 limits the scope of services that can be performed
by auditors (see Chapter 5 for coverage of prohibited services). SOX provides
that it’s unlawful for a registered public accounting firm to provide any nonaudit
service to an issuer contemporaneously with the audit, including:
 Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or
financial statements of the audit client
 Financial information systems design and implementation
 Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution-
in-kind reports
 Actuarial services
 Internal audit outsourcing services
 Management or human resources functions
 Broker, dealer, investment advisor, or investment banking services
 Legal and expert services unrelated to the audit
 Any service that the board determines, by regulation, is impermissible
SOX does allow accounting firms to perform services that aren’t included in
the above list. For example, accountants traditionally perform tax return
preparation services.
Rotating auditors
SOX presumes that an auditor’s long-time familiarity with a company compro-
mises the quality of an audit rather than making the process more efficient
each year. SOX also presumes that auditors lose their objectivity when they
develop a close and comfortable relationship with the client. Accordingly,
SOX Section 203 provides that the lead and concurring audit partners must
rotate off of the audit every five years.
Creating committees inside companies
SOX creates a new class of worker bees within public companies. Section 301
requires that public companies who are listed with the national securities
exchanges and associations (called issuers) form audit committees. These
audit committees are responsible for working with the independent auditors
and getting them the information they need. They’re also responsible for
establishing procedures on related issues, such as record retention and 
hearing complaints.
185
Chapter 13: Existing in a World of Sarbanes-Oxley

Each member of the audit committee must be a member of the board of
directors of the issuer and must be independent.
Audit committee members can receive compensation for serving on the com-
mittee. Accountants and attorneys are prime prospects for board membership.
The audit committee of an issuer is “directly responsible” for the appoint-
ment, compensation, and oversight of the work of any registered public
accounting firm hired by the company to audit its financial statements. It’s
also the audit committee’s job to establish procedures for the “receipt, reten-
tion, and treatment of complaints” received by the issuer regarding account-
ing, internal controls, and auditing concerns.
SOX requires that companies pay the cost of the audit committees and give
them the authority to hire independent counsel or other advisors to carry
out committee functions.
Making management accountable
CEOs and CFOs are likely to be much more proactive in making sure their
companies’ financial statements are accurate now that they have to person-
ally vouch for the statements and risk doing time if they’re not accurate.
SOX Section 302 provides that CEOs and CFOs must personally certify the
“appropriateness of the financial statements and disclosures contained in the
periodic report, and that those financial statements and disclosures fairly
present, in all material respects, the operations and financial condition of the
issuer.” A violation of this section must be knowing and intentional to give
rise to liability.
In addition, Section 302 requires that the CEO and CFO disclose all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in controls over financial reporting to
both the independent accountants and the audit committee. This prevents
management from taking a passive attitude toward serious weaknesses.
SOX also suggests — but doesn’t require — that a corporation’s federal
income tax return be signed by the CFO of the corporation in order to empha-
size its accuracy.
SOX Section 303 now specifically provides that it’s unlawful for any officer 
or director of an issuer to take any action to fraudulently influence, coerce,
manipulate, or mislead any auditor engaged in the performance of an audit
for the purpose of rendering the financial statements materially misleading.
(How could anyone ever think this type of thing was lawful?)
186
Part V: Legal Landmines 

Taking back bogus bonuses
CEOs and CFOs may be required to give back their bonuses if financial state-
ments have to be restated (changed) after an audit due to “material noncom-
pliance” with financial reporting requirements because of fraudulent activity.
SOX Section 304 provides that CEOs and CFOs must “reimburse the issuer for
any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation received”
during the 12 months following the issuance or filing of the noncompliant
document and “any profits realized from the sale of securities of the issuer”
during that period.
Ratcheting up reporting
Federal securities law is based on the premise that investors in a public com-
pany have a right to know the facts and circumstances that would reasonably
and fairly influence their decisions to invest in the company.
SOX attempts to ensure that investors are fairly well-informed by adding the
following provisions to existing law:
 Reflection of accounting adjustments: SOX Section 401(a) requires 
that companies’ financial reports “reflect all material correcting 
adjustments . . . that have been identified by a registered account-
ing firm.”
 Disclosure of off-balance-sheet transactions: SOX requires that a 
company’s annual and quarterly financial reports disclose all material
(significant) off-balance-sheet transactions and other relationships with
unconsolidated entities that may have a material current or future effect
on the company’s financial condition.
 Real-time reporting of key events: Companies need to disclose infor-
mation on material (significant) changes in their financial conditions 
or operations on a rapid and current basis on Form 8-K reports (see
Chapter 3).
Purging company conflicts of interest
Under SOX, auditors can’t accept jobs with their clients, until they have taken
off a complete audit cycle. This makes sense because an auditor might other-
wise hesitate to alienate a prospective employer.
Under SOX Section 206, it’s unlawful for CEOs, controllers, CFOs, chief
accounting officers, and persons in equivalent positions to have been
employed by the company’s audit firm during the one-year period preceding
the audit. It’s also unlawful under SOX Section 402(a) for a company to lend
money to any director or executive officer. Under Section 403, directors, offi-
cers, and 10-percent owners must report designated transactions by the end
of the second business day following the transaction, so that the public can
follow what the “insiders” are doing.
187
Chapter 13: Existing in a World of Sarbanes-Oxley

Exercising internal control
The dreaded SOX Section 404 requires that companies include in their annual
reports (Form 10-K) an internal control report that states:
 Management’s responsibility for establishing and maintaining an ade-
quate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting.
 Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control
structure and procedures of the issuer for financial reporting. The
assessment must include disclosure of any identified material weakness
in the company’s internal control over financial reporting existing at the
company’s fiscal year-end. (Material is an accounting term that means
“significant.” The accounting standards for what is deemed a material
error depend on the type of information that’s being considered.)
 Management’s framework to evaluate the effectiveness of their controls.
 That the company’s auditor has attested to the adequacy of manage-
ment’s assessment and the company’s internal control over financial
reporting.
Stopping the shredders
Under SOX Section 802(a), it’s a felony to “knowingly” destroy or create docu-
ments to “impede, obstruct or influence” any existing or contemplated fed-
eral investigation. This is a SOX section that impacts the criminal provisions
of the law and thus impacts all organizations, not just public companies.
Auditors are required to maintain “all audit or review work papers” for seven
years from the date their report is issued.
Providing whistle-blower protection
Whistle-blowers are employees who report information about corporate fraud
or mismanagement. Under SOX, employees of issuers and accounting firms
are provided whistle-blower protection. These protections prohibit employers
from taking certain actions against employees who disclose information to,
among others, parties in a judicial proceeding involving a fraud claim.
Whistle-blowers are also granted a remedy of special damages and attorney’s
fees. (For more on whistle-blowers, check out the section “Protecting whistle-
blowers” later in this chapter.)
Applying SOX to the Nonprofit Arena
Nonprofits know that even a hint of scandal can send donors and other fund-
ing sources scurrying. Consider what happened at the Red Cross when the
well-intentioned organization used some funds for victims of the September
11, 2001, terrorist attacks for other worthy purposes. This violation of the
188
Part V: Legal Landmines 

donor’s trust and confidence and accounting protocols landed the venerable
Red Cross on the front page of every newspaper in the nation. It also led to 
a chain of events that ultimately caused its director to resign in order to
restore donor confidence. Similarly, prospective donors of the United Way 
all across the nation had the privilege of reading about a scandal at a local
chapter involving large-scale misappropriations of donor funds.
Although only two provisions of SOX directly apply to nonprofits, its passage
has rocked the nonprofit community with discussions about nonprofit account-
ability and about whether nonprofits should adhere to certain provisions of the
Act either on a voluntary or mandatory basis. In fact, Republican Senator
Chuck Grassley of Iowa recently called for similar scrutiny of nonprofits.
The Senate Finance Committee has issued at least one draft paper calling for
stronger nonprofit governance, and it has publicly debated several different
proposals. Efforts to extend provisions of SOX to nonprofits met with con-
cern, however, because of the additional costs it would impose on smaller
nonprofits.
Many scandal-skittish states have proposed or passed regulations that
extend provisions of SOX (or SOX-like provisions) to nonprofit organizations.
For instance, the California Nonprofit Integrity Act of 2004 requires charities
with gross revenues of $2 million or more to have an audit committee.
Specific SOX provisions for nonprofits
Although most provisions of SOX apply only to public companies, two 
provisions are also mandatory for nonprofits. These provisions prohibit 
the following:
 Retaliation against whistle-blowers who inform the appropriate people
of any misconduct that happens within the company
 The destruction, alteration, or concealment of certain documents, or the
impediment of investigations
Beyond these requirements, many nonprofits are voluntarily considering
adopting the practices set forth in the rest of SOX as good business practice.
In other words, it’s unlikely that a nonprofit of any size would knowingly risk
being sued without having certain safeguards in place. Many SOX-sensitive
attorneys and accountants working for nonprofits recommend that every
nonprofit adopt most, if not all, of the following SOX-type standards:
 Audit committees: Your nonprofit should create an audit committee,
and it should separate the function of that committee from the finance
committee. As in the private sector, your nonprofit’s audit committee
needs to be composed of board members who aren’t compensated for
serving on the committee and who don’t have a financial interest or
189
Chapter 13: Existing in a World of Sarbanes-Oxley

other conflict of interest with any company or person doing business
with your nonprofit. (Audit committees are discussed in more detail in
Chapter 10.)
 Outside consultants for your audit committee: SOX allows audit commit-
tees to hire outside consultants, and it requires the audit committee’s
company to pay for the consulting services. Because most nonprofit
organizations have volunteer board members who may or may not be
trained in business and accounting principles, it’s especially important
that independent, outside consultants or other advisors be available to
work with the audit committee.
 Procedures for adopting the auditor’s report: The nonprofit audit com-
mittee needs to meet with the outside audit firm and then recommend to
the full board of directors whether the audit report should be approved
or modified. The full board then formally accepts or rejects the commit-
tee’s report.
 Auditor independence: SOX contains a number of requirements to
ensure the independence of outside auditors. For example, SOX requires
that audit firms rotate the lead partner every five years.
 Bans on prohibited services: SOX prohibits the audit firm from providing
certain nonaudit services. If a nonprofit is required to have audited finan-
cial statements, it’s well-advised to follow this requirement on a voluntary
basis. Prohibited services include bookkeeping, financial information 
systems, and other services (see Chapter 5 for a more complete list).
Consistent with the standards in SOX, a nonprofit’s audit committee
may, however, preapprove certain types of nonaudit services outside of
these categories, such as tax preparation. Additionally, auditors may be
allowed to prepare Form 990 or 990-PF (for private foundations) if such
services are preapproved. (These forms are discussed in more detail in
Chapter 7.)
 CEO/CFO certification: Like their counterparts in the private sector,
nonprofits should consider having CEOs and CFOs certify both the
appropriateness of financial statements and the officers’ fair presenta-
tions of the financial conditions and operations of their companies.
What most nonprofits are actually doing
In 2005, several years after the passage of SOX, the prestigious Urban
Institute conducted an extensive survey (called the National Survey of
Nonprofit Governance) to determine what nonprofits across the nation are
doing with respect to many of the issues relevant to Sarbanes-Oxley. This 
section explores the findings of this important survey.
190
Part V: Legal Landmines 

Forming audit committees
SOX requires for-profit, publicly traded corporations to form independent
audit committees, which are made up of board members. (The audit commit-
tee is responsible for appointing, compensating, and overseeing the auditors,
and for acting as an interface between management and the audit firm. The
audit committee report, whether it has at least one financial expert, can’t
have employees or other individuals who are paid by the organization for
professional services as members. (Check out Chapter 7 for more on audit
committees.)
The Urban Institute survey found that many nonprofits in the United States
(41 percent) have audit committees, and those who don’t appear to be con-
sidering forming them. The survey found that most organizations (54 per-
cent) had formed their committees after or in direct response to the passage
of SOX in 2002.
The survey also asked smaller organizations that don’t currently have audit
committees how difficult it would be for them to form one. The majority (51
percent) of these nonprofits said that it would be either somewhat or very
difficult for them to comply with a law requiring them to establish such a
committee.
Of the 19 percent that said it would be very difficult to form a committee, 
the study found that most of them were smaller organizations. This group
included mostly nonprofits with expenses of under $100,000.
Finding altruistic financial experts
SOX requires public companies to disclose whether they have at least one
financial expert on their audit committees. A financial expert is generally
someone adept at reading financial information, such as a CPA, CEO, or 
financial professional. Because many for-profit organizations have their 
own recruitment issues, it isn’t surprising that 25 percent of the organiza-
tions surveyed said it would be very difficult to recruit a financial expert to
serve on their audit committees. (This isn’t really a surprise considering that
many nonprofits don’t pay board members to serve, whether they’re experts
or not.) Thirty-five percent of smaller organizations surveyed found the
expert search very difficult.
Trying to keep their auditors independent
The reason that SOX places so much emphasis on making auditors indepen-
dent from the firms that they audit is to ensure that they’re objective. SOX
also requires organizations to rotate their audit firms and/or lead partners
every five years. Additionally, audit firms are generally prohibited from pro-
viding the organizations with other non-audit services.
191
Chapter 13: Existing in a World of Sarbanes-Oxley

The Urban Institute survey found that among those nonprofits that that did
have an audit, the great majority also had the same audit firm prepare their IRS
Form 990. But far fewer (20 percent) had used the same firm for other services.
More than half of the nonprofits surveyed had used the same audit firm for
five years or more, and 58 percent had also used the same lead partner.
Most of the organizations (62 percent) that didn’t have an independent audit
said that it would be somewhat or very difficult to comply with a law requiring
them to have one. Most of these organizations were the smallest organizations.
Unlike publicly traded companies, most nonprofits aren’t required to have an
audit — but most of them do it anyway. Sixty-seven percent of the nonprofits
in the Urban Institute survey reported that they had received an audit within
the previous two years. Of the larger nonprofits (those with expenses of over
$500,000), more than 91 percent reported having an audit within the previous
two years.
The Urban Institute survey found that many of the smaller nonprofits that
didn’t have their financial statements compiled or reviewed by an outside
certified professional accountant opted to have them compiled or reviewed
by outside accounting firms, which is a less costly option.
Getting management to sign the 990s
Under SOX, the chief executive and financial officers are responsible for certi-
fying that the organization’s financial statements were prepared using certain
procedures that ensure their accuracy. SOX includes penalties for those who
knowingly and intentionally violate this provision. Although this provision
isn’t mandatory for nonprofits, scandal-sensitive organizations should con-
sider voluntarily complying.
According to the Urban Institute survey, the majority of nonprofits required
their CEOs to sign their organization’s Form 990s. However, the percentage
was considerably lower (29 percent) among the very smallest nonprofits.
Reporting on internal control
SOX requires public companies to make disclosures regarding certain
aspects of their finances and the internal control they exercise to make 
sure that the information on their financial statements is accurate.
Companies must also promptly disclose material (significant) changes in
their operations and finances. Among nonprofits that conducted audits, 
most (76 percent) reported that they make changes publicly available.
192
Part V: Legal Landmines 

Avoiding conflicts of interest
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act generally prohibits publicly traded companies from
making loans to their directors or executives. Similarly, the Urban Institute
survey found that it’s rare for nonprofits to make loans to board members.
Fifty percent of nonprofits in the Urban Institute study had a conflict of 
interest policy for board members. Of the largest organizations, 95 percent
reported having a policy, but only 23 percent of the smallest organizations
reported having one.
Adopting a code of ethics
SOX requires companies to disclose whether they have adopted a code of
ethics for officers (and if they haven’t, they must explain why). Companies
also have to report whether they’ve amended or waived any of the provisions
of their codes of ethics.
Protecting whistle-blowers
The whistle-blower provision of SOX is one of two provisions of the Act that
applies to all organizations, including nonprofits (see the following section to
find out the other SOX provision that applies to nonprofits). SOX makes it a
federal crime for any entity to retaliate against employees who report informa-
tion about fraud or suspected financial misconduct within the organization.
The Urban Institute study found that among nonprofits with at least one
employee, 67 percent had a formal process for staff to report complaints
without fear of retaliation.
Stopping the shredders
Another provision of SOX that applies to all organizations (including nonprof-
its) makes it a federal crime to alter or destroy documents in order to prevent
their use in an official proceeding (see the previous section “Protecting whistle-
blowers” to find out the other SOX provision that applies to nonprofits). SOX
doesn’t specifically require organizations to have a written document-retention
policy, but most organizations implement such policies as a precaution and to
demonstrate a commitment to complying with SOX.
Determining the impact of required 
SOX provisions on nonprofits
What would be the potential impact of extending Sarbanes-Oxley provisions
to nonprofit organizations? The Urban Institute study indicates that the
smallest nonprofits would be impacted the most heavily (see the previous
section “What most nonprofits are actually doing” for details on this study).
According to the study, most smaller organizations didn’t have one or more
193
Chapter 13: Existing in a World of Sarbanes-Oxley

of the recommended SOX-like structures in place, and many reported that it
would be very difficult to comply.
So, in the end, adopting mandatory SOX-like standards could mean that 
forming, staffing, and running small nonprofit organizations would be 
much more difficult.
Implementing Standards Logically: 
A Balanced Approach
Most nonprofit organizations have the perpetual problem of too few dollars
chasing too many worthy causes. This means that, especially for smaller
organizations, if they spend more money to voluntarily comply with SOX,
they’ll have less money to carry out their programs and missions.
Nonprofits aren’t under a specific deadline to comply with SOX standards 
like the for-profit corporations are. In fact, for-profit corporations reported
making many costly mistakes as a result of rushing to comply with deadlines.
These mistakes resulted in bureaucratic structures, unnecessary projects,
and redundant costs.
So, unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofits can (and should) strive to
carefully and efficiently revamp governance structures and migrate steadily
and effectively toward full compliance. In other words, don’t rush it.
Specifically, nonprofits should:
 Understand what SOX does and doesn’t require. Many for-profit compa-
nies wasted millions of dollars on useless data security programs, redun-
dant testing, and misguided training programs, only to realize that these
initiatives were extraneous to the actual legal requirements of SOX.
 Focus on the rationale of SOX for each provision that’s not mandatory.
In other words, SOX is concerned with the integrity of financial report-
ing, not whether data is processed efficiently or with unrelated internal
procedures.
 Adopt a logical timeline for compliance. Don’t rush to artificial dead-
lines. Instead, set priorities and demonstrate a pattern of continuing 
sustainable compliance.
 Balance program goals with the goals of complying with SOX. Risks
within the organization should be objectively assessed by the board,
and when risks are low in specific areas, your nonprofit may not need to
divert program costs for immediate compliance projects.

How SOX-Savvy Is Your Nonprofit?
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) is becoming a model for nonprofit governance.
SOX provides nonprofit organizations with a template that they can use vol-
untarily for their own organizations so they don’t have to develop structures
from scratch as they grapple with governance issues.
Adopting SOX standards can ratchet up credibility with institutional and cor-
porate donors because SOX structures and procedures are easily recognizable
by decision-makers and stakeholders in the private sector. This familiarity
inspires trust. However, the costs and timing of voluntary compliance must 
be carefully balanced against other program funding considerations.
Implementing SOX in the nonprofit arena is different than in the private
sector. Nonprofits may need to adopt SOX standards incrementally, taking
into account the limited resources of their organizations and the diverse
nature of their boards and missions.
This brief quiz tests your knowledge about key provisions of SOX, as they
may practically apply to nonprofit organizations, and it offers tips as to how
your organization can get started in setting realistic compliance goals:
1. True or False: Nonprofits should strive to comply with SOX on a 
timeline that corresponds roughly to the deadlines imposed on the
private sector.
Answer: False
SOX compliance for nonprofits is currently voluntary; nonprofits don’t
have to operate at a frenetic pace to implement reforms under an arbi-
trary deadline as is the case in the private sector. Rather, they can and
should implement initiatives at a practical pace, over a time period that
makes fiscal sense for their particular organizations.
For most nonprofits, SOX compliance is an ongoing process, divided into
identifiable projects and goals consistent with the staffing, training, and
other available resources of the organization. Nonprofits should migrate
sensibly toward the SOX model rather than viewing voluntary compli-
ance as an all-or-nothing proposition.
2. True or False: SOX restricts who can sit on the board of directors,
increases directors’ liability, and makes it more difficult to find and
keep good board members.
Answer: False
195
Chapter 13: Existing in a World of Sarbanes-Oxley

SOX establishes only two standards as to who should sit on a board of
directors. A majority of board members must be independent and the
board must have at least one financial expert who’s familiar with finan-
cial statements and accounting principles to serve on its audit commit-
tee. Generally, board members meet the independence requirement if
they aren’t receiving compensation from the organization other than for
serving in their capacity as board members.
There’s no evidence that SOX increases liability for the board of direc-
tors. To the contrary, it may have the opposite effect by placing greater
responsibility for internal control on management.
The formation of board committees, such as the audit committee 
mandated by SOX, may also have the effect of limiting the liability 
of individual board members. Committee structures may limit responsi-
bility for decisions to the board members directly involved in making
them, rather than attributing actions to all board members regardless 
of whether they were involved or participated.
3. True or False: SOX doesn’t require a board to establish any commit-
tees other than an audit committee.
Answer: True.
SOX doesn’t require a board of directors to establish any committee
other than an audit committee. However, stock exchanges, such as the
NYSE or NASDAQ do require companies that list their stocks with them
to have special nominating committees for nominating directors and 
governance committees for determining corporate governance policies.
Other private sector companies have also voluntarily chosen to form
compensation committees to determine executive compensation and 
disclosure committees to regulate public disclosures.
Nonprofits should establish and adopt committee structures to reflect
their unique missions in the community. For example, if a nonprofit isn’t
required to have its financial statements audited, it may decide to estab-
lish an accounting policy committee instead of an audit committee.
Committee structures can be used to define responsibility and allocate
work fairly and appropriately among board members with varying skills.
In most organizations, it simply isn’t possible to have all board members
involved in every project.
4. True or False: Under SOX, chief financial officers (CFOs) and chief
executive officers (CEOs) must certify that they have personally tested
all internal controls, and they’re responsible for any fraud or error
that occurs within the organization.
Answer: False
196
Part V: Legal Landmines 

SOX requires CEOs and CFOs to personally certify that certain standards
were met with respect to financial statements that their companies file
with the SEC; it doesn’t make them personally liable for fraud, misman-
agement, or error within the organization.
Specifically, CEOs and CFOs must certify that
• They’re responsible for internal control.
• The controls are designed to ensure that material financial infor-
mation is made known.
• The internal controls conform to Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles, or GAAP.
• They’ve evaluated the effectiveness of internal control and their
conclusions as to its effectiveness.
• They’ve indicated any changes in internal control during the
reporting period that could affect the financial statements.
The CEO and CFO must believe that all of the above certifications are
true, and that they’ve performed the required evaluations. However,
recent litigation indicates that management isn’t responsible for acts
committed by others within the organization to subvert internal controls
without management’s knowledge.
5. True or False: A nonprofit organization may need to hire more than
one accounting firm to perform services for it in order to comply 
with SOX.
Answer: True.
SOX prohibits an accounting firm that performs an audit from providing
other accounting or consulting services. The reason for this is that it’s
unethical for audit firms to help generate the financial information that’s
being audited.
SOX strictly prohibits independent auditors from performing manage-
ment, human resource, or investment advisor functions. Independent
auditors are also prohibited from performing bookkeeping services or
helping design financial information systems. They aren’t allowed to pro-
vide appraisal or actuarial services either. The audit firm can, however,
provide tax advice to the organization or help prepare the IRS Form 990
with prior board approval.
6. Identify which of the following are benefits of applying appropriate
SOX internal control standards to nonprofits:
a. Financial institutions and lenders may rely on the organization’s
internal control and governance systems in streamlining their own
process.
197
Chapter 13: Existing in a World of Sarbanes-Oxley

b. Insurance companies may offer lower premiums.
c. It may be easier to attract qualified board members who are wary
of serving on boards of organizations that lack adequate controls.
d. Internal controls inspire the confidence of donors and decision-
makers in the private sector.
e. The organization may be more attractive as a candidate to partici-
pate in joint ventures and fundraising opportunities where public
trust and adequate internal control are selection criteria.
f. All of the above
Answer: f. All of the above.
It’s a reality that nearly all nonprofits must compete for program dollars
and federal grants in some fashion. Transparency in governance and
internal control inspires confidence among corporate and government
donors, placing the organization at a competitive advantage. This
increased transparency also enables organizations to compete more
effectively for lower interest rates and insurance premiums.
7. True or False: Cash-strapped organizations can’t begin to implement
SOX standards without taking needed resources away from current
programs.
Answer: False.
Organizations that don’t feel they can achieve total compliance within a
single fiscal year or reporting period should establish a plan to imple-
ment SOX governance structures and internal control procedures more
gradually. Organizations should strive to show continuing progress and
effort in this area, and to consider SOX standards in developing future
policies.

 Understanding the requirements of the Pension Protection Act
T
here’s no getting around the fact that nonprofit organizations need to be
managed as businesses. For example, like for-profit businesses, nonprof-
its have to report income, and they have to file tax returns. And just as corpo-
rations and other businesses engage in tax planning, nonprofits must make
certain decisions based on tax considerations. A nonprofit organization, for
instance, may decide whether to engage in a particular activity based on
whether income from those activities is deemed exempt or nonexempt.
This chapter looks at two areas of accounting that are unique to nonprofits:
unrelated business income, and charitable contributions and allowable
deductions. I also explain how you can recognize when your organization is
engaging in taxable transactions and activities, and how to plan accordingly.
“Tax Exempt” Doesn’t Mean “Tax Free”
Many times, with many different people, the term nonprofit conjures up
images of an organization that pays no taxes whatsoever. For instance, these
people think “If an organization is a nonprofit, it must not make a profit,
right?” Well, not always. The fact that an organization is tax exempt doesn’t
necessarily mean that it has no tax liability. Some of a nonprofit organiza-
tion’s income will be subject to tax, and some of it may be exempt, depending
on how the income is legally characterized.

So, how do you know which funds your nonprofit must pay taxes on and
which are exempt? It’s not easy, but the IRS tries to make it simpler by using
two major distinctions to identify which income is subject to tax and which
you can keep tax free. Here are the two distinctions:
 Earned versus unearned income: The IRS makes a distinction between
money people donate to an organization, and income that an organiza-
tion earns by selling its products and services.
 Related versus unrelated business income: After a distinction is made
between earned and unearned income, the IRS makes a further distinc-
tion between income that’s earned from activities and products related
to the organization’s tax-exempt purpose, and profit-making activities
that bear no relationship to the organization’s purpose for being.
Confused? Who wouldn’t be? But, never fear. The following sections explain
the reasons for these complicated tax distinctions, and tell you what they
mean in practical terms for your organization.
Distinguishing between earned 
and unearned income
As far as an IRS agent is concerned, nonprofit income comes in two flavors:
unearned and earned.
Unearned income is usually exempt from taxes, whereas earned income is
taxed just like it would be for a for-profit organization involved in a business
venture.
Unearned income is received from donations, grants, and other sources to
support the organization in its operation and mission. Usually, the donors 
of unearned income expect nothing in return for their grants or donations,
other than having the nonprofit apply the donated funds to its charitable 
mission.
In contrast, earned income is the income an organization gets for products
and services sold to the public by the nonprofit organization. When an orga-
nization receives this type of income, the person or entity from which the
income is received expects to receive something of value in return. An exam-
ple of earned income might be a fee for a summer camp for underprivileged
kids. Or, another example might be the selling of adaptive devices to disabled
individuals (for organizations who benefit the groups being serviced).

Part V: Legal Landmines 

Understanding unrelated business income
When a nonprofit organization derives income from a trade or business that’s
“regularly carried on” and isn’t “substantially related” to the performance by
the nonprofit to its exempt purpose or function, that income may likely be
classified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as unrelated business income.
(Check out the section “Testing for unrelated income” for an explanation on
how the IRS determines what’s considered unrelated business income.)
Nonprofits that have $1,000 or more in unrelated business taxable income
must file IRS Form 990-T and pay taxes on this type of income. This form is
discussed in more detail in Chapter 7.
You may be asking yourself the question “Why can’t the government just
leave these nice nonprofit organizations alone?” The simple answer is this:
When nonprofits start competing with for-profit organizations, people get a
sour view that the exempt organization may not be acting to fulfill its mission
or accomplish its tax-exempt purpose, but might instead be using its exemp-
tion to shelter income that would otherwise be taxable.
It isn’t fair then, from a fiscal policy standpoint, to give nonprofits a free tax
ride on their unrelated business income so they can compete with the for-
profit businesses. The nonexempt vendor would suffer unfair competition —
and that’s if it could stay in business at all.
For example, consider this commercially unfair example: Suppose your local
fast-food vendor is charging sales tax and selling food with enough of a
margin to cover its own 34-percent income taxes. Now imagine what would
happen if a local church put up a tax-exempt fast-food stand offering the
same menu at a 34-percent discount reflecting its lower (nontaxable) operat-
ing costs. Doesn’t sound too fair, does it? This is one reason that the IRS takes
a hard look at the relationship of a nonprofit organization’s income relative to
its tax-exempt purpose.
Testing for unrelated income
The IRS doesn’t have specific rules to deal with every bake sale, charity auc-
tion, and fundraiser that nonprofits can concoct. Instead, IRS regulations
specify three general tests. Income is considered unrelated to an organiza-
tion’s purpose if it meets all of the following:
 It’s trade- or business-related: To pass this test, income must come from
a trade or business performed by the nonprofit or from selling goods
and services similar to those sold by for-profit entities.
201
Chapter 14: Some Sticky Accounting Issues That All Nonprofits Face

 It’s regularly carried on: The business activity that generates the
income must be “regularly carried on.” In plain English, this means that
the activity has a frequency and continuity comparable to commercial
activities of for-profit organizations.
For example, if a hospital operates a sandwich stand for one week per
year at a county fair, that activity wouldn’t be considered “regularly car-
ried on.” However, if that same hospital operated a year-round sandwich
stand on the corner of the busiest intersection in town, this would be
considered a business activity that was regularly carried on.
 It has no substantial relationship to the exempt purpose: Generally
speaking, an activity has no substantial relationship to furthering the
exempt purpose of a nonprofit organization if it’s unrelated to the orga-
nization’s mission. (You can find out more about missions in Chapter 4.)
So, if the hospital from the example in the previous bullet can’t show
how selling sandwiches at its year-round sandwich stand furthers its
exempt purpose, it’s likely to meet this third test as well.
As the three tests above indicate, a trade or business is related to an 
organization’s exempt purpose only when it has a significant relationship 
to achieving the exempt purpose of the organization. This also means that 
if an activity is conducted on a scale larger than is reasonably necessary to
perform an exempt purpose, you may come across some tax consequences.
So, in other words, if the activity doesn’t contribute solely to the accomplish-
ment of the exempt purpose, the part of the activity that’s unnecessary
would be considered unrelated trade or business.
For example, income generated from a theatre in a museum that shows edu-
cational films while the museum is open to the public wouldn’t be considered
unrelated business income. However, if the museum shows commercially
released films and operates the theatre as a motion picture theatre that’s
open to the public when the museum is closed, that activity would be consid-
ered unrelated trade or business.
Making exceptions
With every rule comes plenty of exceptions — and the IRS follows suit with
its unrelated income laws. It excludes, for instance, certain trade or business
activities from the definition of unrelated trade or business that may other-
wise fall into this trap. For example, a trade or business in which substan-
tially all of the work is performed without compensation by a volunteer
workforce isn’t considered an unrelated trade or business.
202
Part V: Legal Landmines 

Also, certain income is excluded when tallying up what constitutes unrelated
business income. For example, under the law, royalties, rents, gains, and
losses from the sale of property, dividends, interest, and investment income
are all excluded from the income that counts toward unrelated business 
taxable income.
Other activities that are specifically excluded from the definition of unrelated
trade or business include business activities that are carried out for the 
convenience of members. This exclusion encompasses any trade or business
carried on by an organization primarily for the convenience of its members,
students, patients, officers, or employees. An example of this type of exclu-
sion is a school cafeteria. Another exemption would be the selling of donated
merchandise, which means that any trade or business that sells merchandise
received as a contribution or gift would also be excluded. Thrift shop opera-
tions of exempt organizations, such as Goodwill Stores, would be exempt
under this exclusion.
203
Chapter 14: Some Sticky Accounting Issues That All Nonprofits Face
Checking out IRS Publication 598 for more 
examples of unrelated income
Determining unrelated business income isn’t
always easy or intuitive. That’s why the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) offers a special publica-
tion, Publication 598, titled Tax on Unrelated
Business Income of Exempt Organizations,
which gives various examples of unrelated busi-
ness income.
One example of unrelated business income pro-
vided by the IRS focuses on museum greeting
card sales. In this example, an art museum that
exhibits modern art also sells greeting cards
that display printed reproductions of selected
works from other art collections. Each card is
imprinted with the name of the artist, the title or
subject matter of the work, the date or period of
its creation (if known), and the museum’s name.
The cards contain appropriate greetings and
are personalized on request.
The organization sells the cards in the shop that
it operates within the museum and sells them at
quantity discounts to retail stores. It also sells
the cards by mail order through a catalog that’s
advertised in magazines and other publications
throughout the year. As a result, a large number
of cards are sold at a significant profit.
The museum is exempt as an educational orga-
nization on the basis of its ownership, mainte-
nance, and exhibition for public viewing of
works of art. Accordingly, the IRS takes the
position that the sale of greeting cards with
printed reproductions of art works contributes
to the museum’s exempt educational purposes
by enhancing public awareness, interest, and
appreciation of art. The IRS believes that the
cards may encourage more people to visit the
museum itself to share in educational programs.
The fact that the cards are promoted and sold
in a commercial manner at a profit and in com-
petition with commercial greeting card publish-
ers doesn’t alter the fact that the activity is
related to the museum’s exempt purpose.
Therefore, according to this IRS-provided
example, these sales activities are not unre-
lated income.

Reporting unrelated business income
How does the IRS know about your organization’s unrelated business
income? The answer is that it requires your organization to self-report. In
other words, the IRS expects that you’ll follow the honor system. If you fail to
report, or if you underreport your income, you may face penalties for negli-
gence, substantial understatement of tax, and fraud. (The IRS can find out
about your negligence because it conducts audits of nonprofit organizations
as discussed in Chapter 15.)
Nonprofits must report unrelated business income on IRS Form 990-T, which
is titled Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return. All exempt organi-
zations that have gross income (gross receipts minus the cost of goods sold)
from an unrelated trade or business of $1,000 or more must file this form.
(This requirement is discussed in more detail in Chapter 14.)

The controversy over the NCAA’s tax-exempt
status and unrelated business income
In November 2006, Fox News reported that
Myles Brand, the president of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), wrote a
25-page letter to Congress defending the orga-
nization’s tax-exempt status. He argued that the
organization’s primary mission is education.
The NCAA often comes under attack because
of the enormous amount of revenue it generates
and the exorbitant salaries it pays coaches. 
In 1998, 82 percent of the organization’s $220-
million budget came from television revenues.
And the coach salaries are called into question
because of pay to coaches like Mike Kryzewski,
who’s coach of the men’s basketball program at
Duke. He has a lifetime contract with Duke that
pays a salary of $800,000 per year, but when
other benefits and allowances are added in, his
earnings average about $1.5 million. It’s
reported that he also earns another $1.5 million
from his endorsements for Nike. While
Kryzewski is one of the higher paid coaches,
others also have no problem raking in the cash.
Taxpayers periodically question why the NCAA
continues to keep its tax-exempt status, and
why the federal government subsidizes college
athletics when it seems that the money helps
pay for ever-increasing coaching salaries, some
of which reach seven-figures.
In his letter to Congress, Brand argued that pay
for coaches is on par with other highly recruited
faculty members and said that the NCAA
shouldn’t be punished merely because televi-
sion networks will pay millions (or even billions)
of dollars to televise games. Brand wrote “If the
educational purpose of college basketball could
be preserved only by denying the right to tele-
cast the events, students, university faculty and
staff, alumni, the institutions of higher education
themselves, and even the American taxpayer
would ultimately lose.”
So, given the popularity of college athletics, it’s
unlikely that the NCAA will lose its tax-exempt
status, and the issue of whether the income it
generates is actually unrelated business
income will continue to be a sacred cow that
Congress will begrudgingly ignore.

With the exception of certain retirement accounts and educational accounts,
you must file Form 990-T by the 15th day of the 5th month after the end of the
tax year for your organization. An automatic six-month extension of time is
available for corporations, and a three-month automatic extension is avail-
able for trusts. Form 990-T is filed with the Internal Revenue Service Center 
in Ogden, Utah. IRS Form 990-T and detailed instructions for completing the
form are available at www.irs.gov/charities/index.html under the
“Forms and publications” link.
Valuing Donations Realistically
Even if your nonprofit avoids competing with for-profit businesses, it may
still have some explaining to do to the IRS regarding your unearned income.
(See the section “Distinguishing between earned and unearned income” for a
quick review of what unearned income is.) Even though unearned income is
generally exempt from taxation, this type of income has its own set of issues
when it comes to valuing contributions from donors.
In theory, a donor is responsible for placing a value on non-cash contribu-
tions (a building, a piece of land, or a rare work of art). But, a nonprofit 
organization also has to estimate the value, because a nonprofit that accepts
donations with inflated values assigned to them risks losing its exempt
status. Your organization also needs to know how much the donated prop-
erty is worth so that it can reflect the value accurately in its own financial
statements and know the true value of its asset portfolio. Why? Because 
overvalued assets can cost your organization its credibility.
205
Chapter 14: Some Sticky Accounting Issues That All Nonprofits Face
Calculating the tax due for unrelated 
business income
The tax rate for unrelated business income
varies depending on the type of entity that’s
reporting it. The IRS provides a separate method
for taxing the unrelated business income of
trusts, and a separate method for taxing the
unrelated business income of nonprofit corpora-
tions. Generally, both methods use a graduated
rate system that caps at a certain income level,
after which a flat rate of tax applies. Both meth-
ods are also progressive, meaning that as the
amount of income increases, so does the rate of
tax — until, of course, the top tax rate is reached.
The top rate is then used as a flat rate of tax on
all income over the amount needed to reach the
top rate.

Here’s an example: In 2003, the Wyobraska Wildlife Museum in Gering,
Nebraska, was a small facility far from any large population area. This
museum held more than 800 big game trophies and exotic animals, which
were simply tossed into an old railroad car and three other storage facilities
(they obviously were worth a lot if they got that kind of treatment!). The
museum reported that its collection was valued at over $4.2 million. This
value had been assigned because it was the value that the donors placed on
the taxidermy carcasses it donated — and the museum blindly accepted the
donor values.
After an April 14, 2005, article in the Washington Post titled “Big Game Hunting
Brings Big Tax Breaks” exposed the practice of wealthy hunters taking inflated
tax deductions from the donation of their trophy kills to pseudomuseums,
the IRS cracked down. Now taxidermy deductions are limited to the cost of
preparing, stuffing, or mounting the animal. Deductions for travel and costs
relating to the hunting and killing of the animal are no longer allowed.
The implications of incorrectly valuing your organization’s donations can be
damaging, so in this section, I explain how you can avoid problems.
Figuring out if your donors are 
reporting realistic values
Figuring out how much a non-cash donation is worth can be a complex
process for even the most adept nonprofit organization.
The general rule is that received property is valued at its fair market value
as of the date of the contribution. Fair market value is the price for which
that property would sell between a willing buyer and a willing seller, with 
neither being required to act and both having reasonable knowledge of the
relevant facts.
Determining the value of donated property would be simple if a fixed formula
could be used. Unfortunately, it isn’t that easy. There’s no single formula that
always applies in determining a property’s value. Because formulas don’t
lend themselves to valuing property (at least as far as the IRS is concerned),
donors are advised to use other more objective methods, including the cost
or selling price of the item, the sales of comparable properties, the replace-
ment costs, and the opinion of experts.
206
Part V: Legal Landmines 

Using cost or selling price to establish value
If the donor bought the property recently, taking a look at the purchase price
can be a good starting point. In fact, the purchase price of the property may
be the best indicator of fair market value if the buyer and seller weren’t com-
pelled to enter into a transaction and the market didn’t change between the
date of the purchase and the valuation.
The cost of the property, or its actual selling price, may be relevant if the 
following factors are met:
 The purchase or sale occurred close to the time that the valuation date
is made.
 The purchase and sale is at an arm’s length offer.
 The buyer and seller both know all the relevant facts.
An arm’s length offer refers to an offer from a willing buyer to a willing seller
where neither party is required to purchase. For example, items obtained at 
a liquidation or fire sale aren’t considered to be at arm’s length, because the
seller may not be so willing to unload property at the price it’s being sold for,
but generally in that situation, the seller has no choice in the matter.
Also, if the seller places restrictions or limitations on the property being sold,
that value of the property will be affected. For example, if a parcel of land is
sold but the seller retains an easement to cross over the land to access
another parcel of land, the buyer wouldn’t be able to build anything that
might obstruct the path to the other piece of land. In this case, the value of
the land would be affected.
A factor that might affect the cost or selling price would be unusual market
conditions. These are conditions that may depress the usual prices or make
them skyrocket. Even though the sales price of property at an arm’s length
transaction in an open market is generally the best indicator of fair market
value, sales that occur in a market that’s artificially supported or stimulated
may not offer a true representation of value. That’s why comparable sales
data needs to be taken from sales at an arm’s length transaction in an open
market in order to be valid.
If cost or selling price is going to be used for valuing a deduction, ask the fol-
lowing questions:
 Do the terms of the sale limit what can be done with the property?
 Was the arm’s length offer to buy the property close to the valuation date?
 Was the purchase or sale of the property reasonably close to the date of
contribution?

If your organization is going to compare sales of similar property to ensure
that your donors are reporting realistic values, the trustworthiness of valua-
tion (from the IRS’ standpoint) depends on the degree of similarity between
the properties you’re comparing.
The two properties must be similar in terms of:
 The timing of the sale: Both sales must have taken place in the relevant
time period.
 The circumstances of the sale: The price paid in both sales must be
related solely to the value that the buyer and seller feel the property is
worth, and not to other factors, such as family relationship.
 The conditions of the market in which the sale was made: Temporary
fluctuations in the market can be caused by all sorts of events. So, the
two properties being compared should both have been sold during
times when market conditions were relatively stable.
This type of valuation method is particularly suited for real estate, but it can
also be applied to other types of sales as well. The most important aspect of
this form of valuation is the degree of similarity of between the comparable
property and the donated property, which must be close enough so that the
selling price would be considered relevant by reasonably well-informed
buyers and sellers.
Consider the following example offered by the IRS: You give a rare, old book
to your former college. The book is a third edition and is in poor condition
because of a missing back cover. You discover that there was a sale for $300,
near the valuation date, of the first edition of the book that was in good con-
dition. Although the contents are the same, the books are not at all similar
because of the different editions and their physical condition. So, little con-
sideration would be given to the selling price of the $300 property by knowl-
edgeable buyers or sellers.
So, if your organization decides to use the comparable sales data method, be
sure to consider the following questions:
 How similar is the comparable property to the donated property? Was
the sale at arm’s length?
 What was the condition of the market at the time of the sale?
 How close is the date of the sale to the valuation date?

Considering replacement cost as a basis for value
Another way of valuing property may be to use its replacement cost. Under
this method, the cost of buying, building, or manufacturing property that’s
similar to the donated item might be considered when establishing its fair
market value.
The use of replacement cost as a valuation method has serious limitations,
because often the cost to replace a donated item on the valuation date bears
no relationship to its fair market value. Also, if the supply of the donated item
is more or less than the actual demand for it, the replacement cost becomes
less important.
When determining the replacement cost of donated property, first find the
estimated replacement cost of the item as if it’s new, and then subtract depre-
ciation, wear and tear, and obsolescence. The result is the fair market value.
But, remember that you need to be able to show the relationship between the
depreciated property and the fair market value, as well as how the estimated
replacement cost of the item as if new was determined.
If the donor intends to use replacement cost as a valuation method, ask the
following questions:
 What would it cost to replace the property that’s being donated?
 What’s the relationship between the fair market value and the 
replacement cost?
 Is the demand for the donated property more or less than the supply of it?
Playing it safe with an appraisal expert opinion
Want to take the easy way out and simply have someone tell you how much 
a donation is worth? Get an appraisal! If your organization decides to go this
route, you need to find an expert. But remember that you have to be picky
when choosing an expert. For example, if your Uncle Louie gives you an ash-
tray hat and says “It’s one of a kind and worth a hundred thousand dollars,”
you can bet that his “expertise” definitely won’t cut it. However, if a certified
appraiser who deals in (and collects) rare ashtray hats gives you an opinion
that this particular hat is extremely rare and would fetch at least $5 on the
open market, that’s probably a more reliable source and of more use in estab-
lishing the value of your cherished item.
It would be nice if this was a foolproof way of establishing value, but it isn’t.
So, whatever you do, don’t consider this method an insurance policy against
the IRS second-guessing the value a donor has assigned to a piece of property.
209
Chapter 14: Some Sticky Accounting Issues That All Nonprofits Face

An appraiser’s opinion is only as good as the facts on which it’s based.
Without good facts, it’s simply a guess. And just because an appraiser is 
“certified” by being a member of a professional appraiser’s organization 
doesn’t automatically establish his or her level of competency, or vice versa.
In any event, it’s important to remember that an appraiser’s opinion isn’t
binding on the IRS.
Predicting the unpredictable
Plenty of problems can arise when valuing property for charitable donation
purposes, and your organization may find itself in the middle of a controversy.

Part V: Legal Landmines 
When a nonprofit should get a qualified appraisal
A qualified appraisal is one that’s made not ear-
lier than 60 days prior to the date of the
appraised party’s contribution, that doesn’t
involve an appraisal fee based on a percentage
of the appraised value of the property, that
includes certain information required by the IRS
(like the property’s description, its physical con-
dition, the qualification of the appraisal, and
other relevant information), and that’s prepared
and signed by a qualified appraiser.
Appraisals are generally required if the deduction
being claimed for donated property is more than
$5,000 and needs to be reported using IRS Form
8283, which is filed with the donor’s individual
income tax return. (You can take a look at IRS
Form 8283 in Appendix A.) So, for example, if you
give a number of rare books to different charities
and the total amount for your planned deduction
exceeds $5,000, you need to obtain a qualified
appraisal. Unfortunately, the cost of obtaining the
appraisal isn’t allowable as part of the charitable
deduction. However, appraisal fees may qualify
for a miscellaneous deduction subject to the 2-
percent limit as an itemized deduction on the
donor’s individual income tax return.
Appraisals aren’t required for certain types of
property, including the following:
 Nonpublicly traded stock of $10,000 or less
 A vehicle (for example, a car, boat, or air-
plane) donated after December 31, 2004, if
the deduction is limited to the gross pro-
ceeds from the vehicle’s sale
 Qualified intellectual property (for example,
a patent) donated after June 3, 2004
 Certain publicly traded securities (for exam-
ple, stocks and bonds) that are listed on an
exchange
 Any donation, made after June 3, 2004, of
stock in trade, inventory, or property held
primarily for sale to customers in the ordi-
nary course of business
 A donation made by a corporation before
June 4, 2004
If you claim a deduction of more than $500,000 for
property donated after June 3, 2004, you must
attach a qualified appraisal to your return —
unless the deduction was for a contribution of
cash, inventory, publicly traded stock, or intel-
lectual property.

But, by knowing the common errors that can happen, you can better prepare
yourself. Here are the two most common mistakes:
 Relying too heavily on past events that may not fairly reflect the
future earnings and fair market value of an item. For example, 
suppose a donor contributes the rights of a successful patent to your
organization. Prior to the donation, the patent went through many sales
stages. For example, when the invention was first introduced to the mar-
ketplace, the patent initially generated high revenues. This was followed
by a prolonged stable period of sales, and then a gradually declining
period of sales leveled off to a steady sales history at the time of the
donation. If an appraiser were to give too much weight to the high 
sales period in this example, the valuation would lack integrity. In this
instance, more weight should likely be given to the current sales figures
in determining value.
 Placing a value on property in anticipation of future events that have
yet to occur. As far as the IRS is concerned, you can only base the value
of an item on events that have already occurred, or those that could be
reasonably expected at the time of the gift (for example, the maturity
date of a savings bond).
Dealing with Donations, Deductions, and
Donors Who Overvalue Their Items
People donate all kinds of things to charitable organizations. The value of
this stuff may or may not be readily apparent. For example, if your donors
write a check for a cash contribution each week to your church, the value 
of the donation is obviously straightforward. But, if your donors contribute 
a truckload of clothes, some unique artwork, or a stamp collection, the fair
market value issue becomes a bit trickier — both for the donors and for 
your organization. But, this section can help you stay on the right track.
From the perspective of the donor, the deduction from giving the gift, grant,
or donation may or may not be a significant consideration. For example, 
tax-exempt organizations that make gifts or grants to other tax-exempt orga-
nizations aren’t concerned about receiving a deduction. On the other hand,
individuals are routinely interested in whether a deduction is available — and
if so, they want to know how much that deduction or contribution will be
worth to them when it comes time to filing their tax returns.
211
Chapter 14: Some Sticky Accounting Issues That All Nonprofits Face

Handing out deductions
Because the availability of a deduction may be a primary motivator for many
of your donors, make sure your organization becomes familiar with the rules
for doling out the deductions. Here are the basic rules according to category
of donation:
 Household goods: The items in this group, which includes furniture,
appliances, and linens, are generally worth much less than the price
paid for them when they were new. This type of property may have little
or no market value because of its worn condition. Or, it may have an
increased value if it’s an antique, in which case an appraisal will likely 
be required.
 Used clothing and other personal items: As with household goods,
these personal items are usually worth much less than their original sell-
ing price, and the value of such items is generally set by the value that a
purchaser may pay at a thrift store or consignment shop. If the clothing
is something of an intrinsically higher value, such as a fur coat or an
expensive gown, the donor may have to file the special IRS Form 8283
with his or her return to report the value and how he or she arrived at
that value (see the sidebar “When a nonprofit should get a qualified
appraisal” for more on this form).
 Gems and jewelry: These items almost always require an appraisal
because of the unique and specialized nature of the items. Typically an
appraisal would describe the type of gem, its condition, style, cut, and
setting, and whether it’s currently in fashion. Sentimental or personal
value doesn’t come into play here, but if the jewelry was owned by a
famous person, such as Elvis or Marilyn Monroe, its value may increase.
 Paintings, antiques, and art: All I can say here is call your appraiser. 
If the art is valued at $20,000 or more, a complete copy of the signed
appraisal must be attached to the donor’s return, along with a photo of
the donated property. If the art donated is valued at $50,000 or more, the
donor can request a statement of value from the IRS for the item being
claimed. A statement of value can be requested by sending in a copy of
the qualified appraisal, a completed IRS Form 8283, and a user fee (the
fee the IRS charges to review your materials) of $2,500 plus $250 for each
item in excess of three.
 Collections: Common types of collections that may be donated include
books, manuscripts, stamps, coins, autographs, sports memorabilia,
guns, photos, records, and natural history items. Because of the varied
nature of these items, the method of determining fair market value is
likewise broad. Estimates of value through collector’s publications or
dealer price lists are useful, but an old-fashioned appraisal may also 
be used.
212
Part V: Legal Landmines 

 Cars, boats, and airplanes: An acceptable measure for these types of
vehicles is the price listed in a used vehicle pricing guide for a private
party sale (such as Kelley’s Blue Book or Edmunds), not the dealer retail
value of a similar vehicle.
The deduction for donating a car, boat, or plane is generally limited to
the gross proceeds of its sale by the receiving organization. If the value
of the vehicle donated is more than $500, a contemporaneous written
acknowledgement from the donee organization (that is the receiving
organization) is required. An acknowledgment is considered contempo-
raneous if it is furnished within 30 days after the date of the sale or the
contribution.
Just because an item is worth its weight in gold to your donor doesn’t mean
the IRS will see things the same way. If the donor overstates the value of an
item on his or her tax return, penalties may apply. If your organization rou-
tinely allows donors to overstate valuations, it can lose its exempt status.
Penalizing donors who overvalue
Your organization may not be doing donors any favors by letting them over-
value their deductions. For instance, overzealous donors who deduct too
much face a penalty of 20 percent of the taxes they should have paid. This
hefty penalty applies if the value of the property that the donor claims on 
the return is 200 percent or more of the correct amount, and they underpaid
their tax by more than $5,000 because of that overstatement.
Are your donors too rich to worry about a paltry 20-percent penalty? Have
them try the IRS’s 40-percent penalty on for size. This penalty applies where
the value of the claimed deduction is more than 400 percent of the correct
amount, and the donor underpaid his or her tax by more than $5,000 because
of the overstatement.
The Requirements of the 
Pension Protection Act
President George W. Bush signed the Pension Protection Act (PPA) into law
on August 17, 2006. Not only does the PPA protect pensions, it also creates a
number of rules that apply to nonprofit organizations as well as to donors
who make gifts and contributions to tax-exempt organizations.
This section gives a quick rundown of how these new rules may affect donors
and the charities to which they generously contribute.
213
Chapter 14: Some Sticky Accounting Issues That All Nonprofits Face

Cash contributions
For the well-meaning churchgoer who throws a $5 bill into the collection
plate every Sunday and takes a deduction for those contributions on his 
or her tax return, prior law allowed the taxpayer to use their own written
records, such as a log or diary of the contributions where the amount was
less than $250.
The PPA has changed things dramatically. Under this new act, no matter 
how small the amount, no deduction is allowed for contributions made 
after August 17, 2006, unless the donor maintains a bank record (such as 
a cancelled check) or obtains a written communication from the donee 
organization showing the name of the charity and the date and amount 
of the contribution.
Clothing and household items
For contributions made after August 17, 2006, the PPA doesn’t allow a 
deduction for a charitable contribution of clothing or household items 
unless they’re in good used condition or better. Also, unless a qualified
appraisal is attached to the taxpayer’s return, no deduction is allowed for a
single article of clothing or a household item that’s valued at more than $500.
Appreciated personal property
Let’s say that a donor is finally willing to part with that old painting hanging
in his garage; the one that he bought at a rummage sale for $25 and that’s
now worth $25,000. The art-loving donor may deduct the fair market value of
the $25,000 painting if he contributes it to an art museum that will display it.
If, on the other hand, the donor contributes the painting to a museum who
sells it within three years of the contribution, the deduction is limited to the
painting’s tax basis: $25.
Fractional interests
A fractional interest is one where a donor gives away the right to possess or
use an object for a given period of time. For example, consider the donor who
owns a valuable art collection, which is located at her summer home. When
during the winter months she flees the cold and gives the local museum the
right to display her art collection she’s giving them a fractional interest in it.
214
Part V: Legal Landmines 

This type of contribution was previously allowed, but under the PPA, they’re
no longer allowed unless both of the following conditions are met:
 Immediately before the contribution, all of the interests in the property are
owned either by the donor or by the donor and the donee organization.
 The donor must contribute the remaining interest in the property to the
same donee organization within 10 years of the initial donation or, if ear-
lier, before the donor’s death.
This is one of the PPA’s most controversial and criticized provisions, because
it significantly curtails the desirability of making fractional gifts of art work to
museums.
Facade easements
A facade easement is an easement by a property owner who, for a price,
agrees not to alter or change the outward appearance of his or her historic
home. Facade easements can be contributed, and a charitable deduction can
be taken for the contribution. The PPA limits the facade easement deduction
to easements that:
 Preserve the building’s entire exterior
 Prohibit any exterior change inconsistent with the structure’s historic
character
 Are substantiated by a qualified appraisal
Also, the PPA states that any deduction in excess of $10,000 must be 
accompanied by a $500 user fee to the IRS.

Communicating Comfortably 
with the IRS
In This Chapter
 Becoming familiar with the Tax Exempt/Government Entities Division
 Responding to soft contacts
 Requesting information with a determination letter
 Knowing the best ways to survive an IRS audit
A
s the nation’s taxing authority, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is
both revered and feared by taxpayers of all types, including nonprofit
organizations. Because nonprofits, like everyone else, are required to pay tax
on some or all of their income, the need to communicate with the IRS arises
occasionally for some organizations and constantly for others.
As you can imagine, most people are as comfortable receiving a letter from
the IRS as they are sitting in a dentist’s chair with a screaming drill headed
for their mouths. Nonprofit organizations are no different than private citi-
zens in this regard.
When questions about tax forms and returns arise, you or someone from
your organization will need to answer them, which often involves meeting
with IRS agents and answering IRS notices. This chapter can help you prepare
for those fun meetings.
The Tax Exempt and Government 
Entities Division of the IRS
To say that the IRS is a complicated entity would be an understatement. I could
write several books on what it does and how it works (and I still probably
wouldn’t be able to cover it all). Suffice it to say that the IRS collects taxes from
five primary areas, including organizations that fall within the following groups:

 Small business/self-employed
 Wage and investment
 Large and mid-size businesses
 Criminal investigation
 Tax-exempt and government entities
Nonprofit organizations are generally concerned with, and will interact most
prominently with, the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division (TE/GE
Division), so that’s what the remainder of this chapter will cover. The TE/GE
Division sprang to life in 1999 as part of the overhaul of the IRS. Although the
TE/GE Division interacts mostly with nonprofits, it also deals with tax-qualified
retirement plans (such as 401(k)s, profit sharing, and pension plans) as well as
government entities. Even though nonprofits generally don’t pay much in the
way of income tax, they do pay more than $220 billion in employment taxes
and income tax withholding. In fact, the TE/GE Division estimates that this
customer base controls over $8.2 trillion in assets!
In a nutshell, the TE/GE Division helps organizations understand and comply
with tax law, and it protects the public by applying the tax law. In doing its job,
the Division addresses the following basic needs of nonprofit organizations:
 Education: The TE/GE Division provides education to nonprofits by
advising them about what areas of the tax law might affect them.
 Communication: The TE/GE Division communicates with these nonprof-
its, supplying a real, live person to talk to and interface with at the IRS in
connection with their nonprofit issues and questions.
 Issuance of rulings: The Division’s rulings generally deal with specific
areas that are applicable to tax-exempt organizations that are either
unclear in the industry or that require special attention at the request 
of a specific customer.
 Entrance into agreements: The TE/GE Division has the authority to
enter into agreements with customers who may have either fallen out 
of compliance or need to work out some sort of problem with the IRS.
When entering these agreements, the organizations agree to comply
with certain requirements in order to avoid further action by the IRS.
 Examination of returns: The TE/GE performs an examination function,
much like the other branches of the IRS. The Division looks for noncom-
pliance, which can be caused by anything from not filing a Form 990 to
not reporting an honorarium received by an officer of a nonprofit as
income (check out Chapter 7 for more on filing the dreaded Form 990).
 Taxpayer assistance: The TE/GE Division provides customer account
services. These services help taxpayers file returns more efficiently,
accurately, and timely. The TE/GE also provides answers to questions
that the customer base may have and supplies information on any
issues that may arise.
218
Part V: Legal Landmines 

Soft Contacts: Friendly Notes 
from the IRS
The TE/GE Division believes in reaching out to the public in non-intimidating
ways (to the extent that’s possible for an arm of the IRS). These friendly com-
muniqués are referred to as soft contacts. In case you’re unfamiliar with soft
contacts, the following sections tell you how to identify and handle them.
Knowing a soft contact when you see one
The most common type of soft contact is a letter from the IRS to a nonprofit
organization asking for information about a certain function of the organiza-
tion’s activities. Some functions that the IRS may be curious about include
questions about fundraising activities and the organization’s accounting 
practices.
219
Chapter 15: Communicating Comfortably with the IRS
Understanding why your organization is taxed
In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln and Congress
needed a way to finance the Civil War, and so
they created the position of Commissioner of
Internal Revenue to head up the nation’s tax col-
lection agency. It was a great way to pay for war
expenses (and apparently still is). Income tax was
repealed 10 years later, but Congress revived it in
1894. One year later, the Supreme Court ruled it
unconstitutional (those were the good old days).
Fast-forward on the timeline to 1913, when
Wyoming ratified the 16th Amendment, which
gave Congress the authority to enact a tax on
income. Later that same year, the very first indi-
vidual income tax form (1040) came on the
scene, and Congress decided to enact a 1 per-
cent personal income tax on anyone with
income above $3,000. The tax increased to 6
percent if a person’s income was more than
$500,000.
Five years later during World War I, the highest
tax bracket rose to 77 percent, which was used
to pay for war expenses. After World War I, the
income tax dropped sharply, all the way down
to 24 percent in 1929, and then rose again during
the Great Depression. Then came World War II.
To make sure that taxes would be collected,
Congress passed a payroll withholding require-
ment, which is when quarterly tax payments
came into being.
The taxing agency was revamped in the 1950s,
and the official name, “Internal Revenue
Service,” was also adopted. Finally, in 1998, the
IRS Restructuring and Reform Act again mod-
ernized the IRS, with a view toward a private
sector model and customer service.

In 2004, the IRS contacted more than 1,800 public charities and private foun-
dations through the mail to request compensation practice information.
About 1,200 of these initial contacts were what are commonly referred to 
as compliance checks.
A compliance check is an IRS review to determine whether an organization is
following proper recordkeeping and reporting procedures. However, remem-
ber that a compliance check isn’t an audit. Instead, it’s a friendly review
that’s designed to alert an organization to potential errors.
Responding to a soft contact
If you’re the lucky recipient of a soft contact or a compliance check letter,
chances are the contact was triggered by some part of your IRS Form 990
being incorrectly answered or omitted entirely. (The most frequently omitted
information generally refers to loans, deferred compensation, and fringe ben-
efits of nonprofit organizations.)
When you receive this type of contact from the IRS, you should respond as
fully and accurately as possible to the questions that it asks and within the
time frame that the letter specifies. These types of letters are sent for a
reason. In other words, they aren’t meant to be left unopened in the back of
your file cabinet! Seriously, the IRS is likely seeking information that can help
your organization run more efficiently and help the industry overall. And, as
with most organizations, if you don’t respond, you may receive further corre-
spondence of a less congenial nature.
Contacting TE/GE Customer 
Account Services
Nonprofit officers and directors, as well as their accountants, may have 
questions about the best way to report information on annual IRS Form 990
(discussed in Chapter 7). They may even have choices to make as to how to
treat certain income and expense items on the form. Sometimes organiza-
tions are even confronted with issues that affect their ongoing tax-exempt
status. If you find yourself in one or more of these predicaments, you should
consider contacting TE/GE Customer Account Services. One of the goals of
the TE/GE Division is to help educate its customer base. It provides an easy
way to interface with a live person to answer technical and procedural ques-
tions concerning nonprofit organizations and charities.
220
Part V: Legal Landmines 

The easiest way to contact TE/GE Customer Account Services is to simply
call (877) 829-5500, which is a toll-free number. (I told you they were friendly!)
If you express yourself better in writing, your issue is extremely complicated,
or for some other reason you prefer to communicate in writing, you can 
contact TE/GE Customer Account Services at:
Internal Revenue Service
Exempt Organizations Determinations
P.O. Box 2508
Cincinnati, OH 45201
You can contact your local IRS office, but the Cincinnati, Ohio, facility of the
IRS is generally designated as the “go to” location for handling customer base
questions.
Contacts with the TE/GE Customer Account Services can be done on an
anonymous basis, so if you’re concerned that revealing your identity may
lead to some sort of audit, you can put your mind at ease.
Prior to calling or writing, you should note that the IRS doesn’t provide legal
advice, and it can’t tell you what direction is best for your organization. If you
need more directional advice, contact your lawyer.
If your question is one that’s so unique, novel, or without precedent, you may
be required to request a determination letter on the issue (check out the sec-
tion “Sending a Determination Letter” later in this chapter for details).
Deciding when to get a lawyer
Your organization may need to call upon a tax lawyer to help with procedural
issues, answer highly technical questions, and otherwise tell you whether
you’re moving in the right direction. And if your lawyer can’t help you
directly, he or she may be able to tell you who can.
Sending a Determination Letter
A determination letter request is a letter in which you ask the IRS to give your
organization some advice on a matter before it actually becomes controver-
sial, or before your organization falls into noncompliance. For example, an
organization may want to know if a particular fundraising program will be
subject to income tax. That same organization may also have questions about
the forms that it’s required to file for the fundraiser.
221
Chapter 15: Communicating Comfortably with the IRS

Even though you can prepare a determination letter request on your own,
nonprofit organizations generally enlist the aid of an attorney or accountant
to dot all the i’s and cross all the t’s.
The determination letter request is usually a lengthy letter for your organiza-
tion and attorneys to prepare. It entails some cost, and it requires you to set
forth a specific set of facts (not hypothetical) that the IRS can directly address.
In response to your request for a determination, you’ll likely receive a private
letter ruling, which gives you specific advice that’s applicable only to the
questions you asked about in your determination letter request.
According to IRS regulations, some exempt organizations must request a pri-
vate letter ruling for certain issues, including advance approval of scholar-
ship programs, voluntary termination of a private foundation, and certain
changes in accounting methods and periods.
Surviving an IRS Audit
Imagine getting a phone call or letter from the IRS informing you that your
nonprofit organization has been selected for an audit. During this jarring ini-
tial contact, the IRS usually tells you what year it’s going to examine your
organization, and what information its staff plans to review. The worst aspect
of an audit, however, is that the process is inconvenient and time-consuming.
It’s also pretty intimidating. But, chances are your nonprofit’s return was
selected for a reason. The most common audit triggers come from informa-
tion that’s reported (or not reported) on the annual Form 990. This section is
here to help.
Looking at things from the 
auditor’s perspective
When the IRS initiates an audit of your nonprofit, it usually tells you upfront
the issues that it will be looking at on your return. So, it’s a good idea to look
at the items with which the IRS is concerned. Go over these issues with
others in your organization, and make sure that the people who will be com-
municating with the IRS understand the issues that will be discussed. You
should also try to figure out why the IRS is taking the position that it is.
222
Part V: Legal Landmines 

Identifying any errors
In preparation for the audit, get a copy of your organization’s Form 990 for
the year in question, exactly as it was filed (with all attachments). Focusing
on the entries that are of concern to the IRS, check all the calculations for
accuracy. Also, review any documentation supporting these entries.
If you do find an error, there’s little chance that it can be corrected once an
audit is underway. However, this isn’t the end of the world! IRS auditors will
work with you to help resolve the errors. If it ultimately turns out that there’s no
discernable error on your nonprofit’s return, you’ll know you’re in good shape.
When reviewing your nonprofit’s Form 990, you might also look for items that
weren’t identified as part of the audit, but that you may be questioned about
after the audit is underway. Examples of such items for nonprofits include
information on expenses (especially with regard to salaries, compensation,
and employee benefits) and printing and publications. So that you aren’t
caught off guard, it’s important to be prepared to answer questions on all 
out-of-the-ordinary entries.
Studying filings from other tax years
After reviewing the return for the year in question, take a look at the return for
the preceding year (and subsequent year, if available). You need to perform
this check because when selecting a nonprofit return for audit, the IRS may
very well look at the returns filed for the years before and after the year in
question to see if the items of interest have been reported consistently. If 
the items in question appear to be unusual or outside the normal range for its
category or the dollar level of your nonprofit (and the reporting is consistent),
an audit of the years prior and subsequent to the return being audited may
follow, especially if the return for the year in question is found to be in error.
Getting your ducks and digits in a row
Many audits simply question a few line items, which may be easily substanti-
ated by providing the records relating to the entry on the return. In some
cases, if the audit is narrowly focused, a face-to-face meeting with the auditor
may not be necessary, and support for the items in question can be provided
by mail or facsimile. However, if the records are voluminous and/or could be
better explained in person, it may be best to present them to the auditor in
person. Either way, your records need to be in some kind of order.
223
Chapter 15: Communicating Comfortably with the IRS

If your records are already organized, great. If not, you (or your accountant)
need to put them together in short order, and in a logical manner. All records
may be pertinent, so having them organized and readily available is important.
If records aren’t available for some reason, be prepared to explain why (for
example, lost due to relocation or floods). “My dog ate it” isn’t a good excuse.
Some acceptable excuses, however, might include
 Transition of employees
 Data loss due to theft or damage
 Pressing matters within the organization
If you need some tips on organizing your records, take a look at the following
sections.
Keep copies of everything
It’s important to keep original copies of all records that are within your con-
trol. So, if you need to provide records to substantiate an item, make a copy
and keep the original. It’s also a good idea to keep a list of all documentation
that you provided to the auditor, as well as the date provided, for your non-
profit’s records.
Communicate promptly
Surprisingly, some nonprofits that receive letters from the IRS don’t respond.
To put it mildly, this is a poor strategy. When the IRS writes you, it isn’t send-
ing you a holiday greeting or a credit card application. In other words, this
isn’t junk mail, and you’re best advised to open any correspondence immedi-
ately to find out why the IRS deems it necessary to communicate with your
organization.
Appoint a point person
If a letter from the IRS requests anything more than a simple explanation of
an item and requires you to contact the Service, do so at your earliest conve-
nience. For these purposes, your nonprofit organization should have a point
person who always communicates with the IRS so that the organization can
speak with one voice. This point person should be the nonprofit organiza-
tion’s controller, chief financial officer, accountant, or attorney. For smaller
organizations that don’t have those positions, it’s best to appoint the trea-
surer, president, or some other high-ranking officer.
After your organization’s representative is appointed, his or her first conver-
sation with the IRS auditor should be to get all the relevant information that’s
available, such as what items are under review (if you aren’t already aware of
that), when and where they want to meet, what records are requested, and
the name of all the relevant parties at the IRS.
224
Part V: Legal Landmines 

During the initial conversation, it’s also a good idea for the point person to
casually ask for the name and phone number of the group manager. The point
person may find it difficult to get this important information in later stages of
contact because auditors are incredibly busy folks who are often in the field.
Also, it may be necessary to contact someone else within the audit group at
one time or another, and getting the name of the group manager in charge of
the audit upfront is less likely to upset the auditor than if requested later on,
especially if things aren’t going well or personalities differ.
Stay one step ahead
As you begin communicating with the IRS, you’ll quickly get a better sense of
what it’s interested in reviewing. At this point, then, you should stay a step
ahead by considering whether the item being reviewed might lead the audi-
tor to look at other items on the return that aren’t currently in question. For
example, if the auditor is interested in reviewing compensation, review your
nonprofit organization’s policies and procedures on expense reimbursement,
travel, receipt of gifts, and other compensatory items.
If you’re trying to stay one step ahead, it’s also important to gather all sub-
stantiation necessary to support information reported on the particular entry
in question. That way you can begin to decide the best way to explain the line
item entry to the auditor. If you’re missing records, be able to explain why.
And finally, make a list of any questions that you may have for the auditor, and
if you’re meeting in person, prepare your documentation for presentation.
Meeting face to face
If a face-to-face meeting with an IRS auditor is required, it will likely take place
on the premises of your nonprofit organization. This helps the auditor get a feel
for the operations of the organization, meet the staff, scope out the physical
layout of the enterprise, and basically understand the nature of the operations.
If this on-site meeting isn’t practical, or if your nonprofit’s schedule or the audi-
tor’s schedule can’t accommodate the meeting, your organization then needs
to send its representative to the office of the auditor for the meeting.
Your representative, or point person, needs to be completely prepared for
the meeting with the auditor (see the section “Appoint a point person” earlier
in this chapter for details on a point person’s duties). Here are some prepara-
tion tips for a face-to-face meeting:
 The point person should have all necessary documentation, paperwork,
records, and other substantiation prepared and ready to give to the
auditor as the meeting progresses.
 The point person should respectfully and politely guide the meeting
through the various issues presented, and should answer any questions
fully and fairly.
225
Chapter 15: Communicating Comfortably with the IRS

 If any necessary answers or documents can’t be readily produced at the
meeting, the point person should gather and forward those items to the
auditor within a reasonable time frame that’s agreed on by the IRS.
 If any negotiable issues arise, they should be worked out and agreed to
during the course of the audit. You should also agree on the time frame
for responding.
Following up with the auditor
After the meeting, I highly suggest that you follow up with the auditor in writ-
ing to confirm any results of the audit that were discussed orally. This follow-
up establishes a record of understanding for later reference, and allows the
auditor to note any disagreements.
Ending on a good note
Hopefully your audit will go smoothly, painlessly, and quickly. If an agreement
is required or an error is found, the auditor will generally work with your
organization to help resolve the issues raised and see that future compliance
isn’t a problem. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact the
exempt organization’s section of the TE/GE Division. (Refer to the section
“Contacting TE/GE Customer Account Services” earlier in this chapter for
contact info.) These IRS workers really can be very helpful!

The Internet Nonprofit Center
Who would have thought that you could find a nonprofit center on 
the Internet? The Internet Nonprofit Center, that’s who! Located at www.
nonprofits.org, this site is a subset of a larger, multicultural Web site
called Idealist.org, which is available in 11 languages. This organization,
found at www.idealist.org, promotes altruistic motives under links 
such as Imagine, Connect, Find, Post, Reach Out, and Donate.
Launched by a project called Action Without Borders in the early 1990s and
edited by Putnam Barber, the Internet Nonprofit Center’s Web site compiles
frequently asked questions (and answers, of course) from e-communications
on nonprofits.
Upon arrival at www.nonprofits.org, Internet Nonprofit Center visitors
immediately find the main Nonprofit FAQ (frequently asked questions) 
pane, which lists five link categories: organization, management, regulation,
resources, and development. Each link takes the surfer to a range of
resources — at least 20 sublinks under each of the five main categories —
that in turn lead downstream to topical discussions, blogs, and further
resource and informational links.
On the right-hand side of the main pane, you can find more links, which lead
you to the frequently asked questions. And if you’re looking for a volunteer
opportunity or internship (or a number of other nonprofit items), check out
the Find box, where you can search the database.

The Internet Nonprofit Center Web site has remarkable a depth and breadth
of information and guidance for anyone interested in any aspect of the non-
profit sector. Try it — you’ll like it.
USA.gov
To find out what type of information the U.S. government offers, visit
www.USA.gov (or you can jump straight to the nonprofit tab by going to
www.usa.gov/business/business_gateway.shtml). This Web site is
the U.S. Government’s office Web portal to more information than you could
read in a lifetime. It bills itself as a network of links to federal government
information and services of interest to the public (and especially to nonprofit
organizations), and it lives up to that claim.
While all of the other tabs on this site are helpful and chock-full of informa-
tion, the For Businesses and Nonprofits tab is the most applicable to the sub-
ject matter of this book, and is the real reason we’re even discussing this site.
You can find some great info under the For Business and Nonprofits tab. For
example, consider the following, which you can find by clicking on the
Nonprofit Organizations link:
 If you’re looking for a grant, information on a grant, how to write a grant,
how to make grants, or how grants are granted, check out the heading
Grants, Loans, and Other Assistance. Under this heading are links to
state and local funding directories, faith-based and community initia-
tives, surplus government property for governments and nonprofits,
writing grant proposals, and much more.
 Under the Management and Operations heading, you can find links to
information regarding charitable activities, such as state forms and
information, and nonprofit standard mail eligibility. The links under 
this heading can help you get useful tips on managing and operating
your organization, no matter what size it may be.
 Under the Tax Information heading, you can find links to tons of tax
information, including federal tax information for charities and nonprof-
its and a tax guide for churches and religious organizations. These links
take you directly to information put out by the IRS in simple language to
help you understand tax issues and deal with them before they become
tax problems.
USA.gov is the place to go for quick-find info on government resources at both
the federal and state levels — it’s a must-visit, if for no other reason than to
say you’ve been there (done that, saw the movie, and bought the T-shirt).

Ten Questions to Ask Before
Agreeing to Join a Nonprofit Board
In This Chapter
 Getting the appropriate info before joining a board
 Understanding your obligations as a board member
 Looking at the legal liabilities of serving on a board
S
ome boards seem to lead their organizations very effectively, moving
smoothly through strategic agendas that include holding management
accountable to the mission of the organization. Other boards become bogged
down with bickering or paralyzed by apathy, inertia, and inexperience —
while the staff seems to run the place.
So, before you commit to helping fulfill a company’s mission by joining its
board, it’s important to get a realistic (as opposed to idealistic) view of the
organization. To help you do just that, this chapter shows you how to assess
the legal and financial shape of the organization before you commit.
Who’s on the Current Board and 
How Did They Get There?
You can tell a lot about how much a board will accomplish by looking at
who’s sitting on it. Ask, as diplomatically as possible about the skills and
experience of the people on the board. Knowing this information will clue
you in as to the areas in which the board is particularly strong or weak. 
For example, if no one on the board has an accounting background or any
experience reading financial statements, you may want to ask how the board
exercises any financial oversight responsibilities it may have.

Most board members of nonprofit organizations are recruited by existing
board members or someone in the organization, such as a CEO or executive
director. You also may be asked to join a board because you have expressed a
commitment to the organization in the past by volunteering or giving money.
Or, you may even be asked to join because you seem to have the skills to get
things done.
In any event, because most board positions pay either nothing or very little,
many board members decide to sign on because of personal commitment or
as a community networking opportunity.
Board members may be selected or appointed in a variety of ways. How they
are appointed can affect the credentials and perspective of the board mem-
bers. For example:
 Nepotism is a factor for foundations: In a public charity, new board
members are often nominated by sitting board members. In larger public
charities, the organization may have a nominating committee who sub-
mits names to the board. If you’re on the board of a private foundation,
board members may be appointed because they contributed money to
establish the foundation or are related to someone who did.
Private foundations, as discussed in Chapter 11, often allow donors to
control the funds that they make available for philanthropic purposes,
and this greatly influences who’s selected to serve on a board.
 What the organization’s bylaws say: The bylaws of an organization 
state how the board members are selected. For example, the bylaws 
may state that the directors are elected by the organization’s member-
ship or are selected by a vote of the existing directors for a term of
years. (See Chapter 4 for more on creating bylaws for your nonprofit.)
 Restrictions imposed as to whether board members must be indepen-
dent: Some organizations have provisions in their bylaws that require 
a majority of their directors to be independent, which means that they
can’t be employed by or have certain types of financial relationships
with the nonprofit organization. (Check out Chapter 8 for more on inde-
pendence provisions.) This type of provision is becoming more preva-
lent in nonprofit bylaws after the advent of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
which is discussed in Chapter 13.
How Long Are the Director’s Terms?
Be sure to check out the term of years for which directors are appointed 
on the board because you may be making anywhere from a two- to five-year
commitment. Commitments can be broken, and priorities can change, but
resignation can be sticky. And resignation is something that other board
members can talk you out of by reminding you of the terms.
236
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

On the other hand, if the term is extremely short (such as one to two years),
and you’re planning on proposing a relatively controversial agenda after
you’re on the board, you may want to ask yourself whether you’ll have the
time to push it through before they push you off.
In any event, information about the term limits of board members is usually
spelled out in the organization’s bylaws.
How Many Board Members Does 
It Take to Get Anything Done?
As an individual board member, you’ll basically be powerless. You’re only
one vote on a board that must act as a group. The bylaws will specify how
many members your board has (usually between six and twelve). The bylaws
will also specify how many board members must be present to conduct busi-
ness and to put a matter up for a vote. This number is called a quorem.
Before you agree to sit on a nonprofit board, be sure you understand how
many members are required for a quorum, and whether meetings must take
place in person or whether they can occur by phone in order to convene a
quorum.
What Committees Does 
the Board Control?
One way that you can have a more powerful voice on a board is by being
appointed to a committee. A committee is a subgroup of board members
(which can be as small as one person) that’s authorized by the board to
gather information or act on an issue. Examples of typical committees
include the following:
 Audit committees: These types of committees work with the nonprofit
organization’s auditors or accountants and make sure that the financial
reports that are generated are based on accurate information supplied
by the organization. (Flip to Chapter 10 for more on audit committees.)
 Programming committees: These committees are often formed to carry
out specific programs (such as a yoga class or a Bible study group) or to
look at the feasibility of undertaking new ones.
237
Chapter 17: Ten Questions to Ask Before Agreeing to Join a Nonprofit Board

 Fundraising committees: Because no nonprofit could exist without
donors and a source of funds, many organizations have committees that
convene to explore fundraising opportunities, and report to the board.
 Community relations and outreach committees: Community relations
and outreach are closely related to fundraising, but they also may
involve creating a community awareness of the nonprofit.
Boards can delegate acting power to committees. So, if you’re joining a non-
profit and a particular program is of importance to you, ask before joining the
board (for instance while they’re in the process of recruiting you to work for
free) if there’s an opportunity to be appointed to a committee that handles
the project in which you’re interested.
Can I See the Books and Records 
of the Organization?
Many states have laws that require members of nonprofit organizations to
make books and records available for inspection by members. Additionally,
forms filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) must be made available.
At a minimum, you have a right to see the organization’s Form 990-PF. The
990-PF is a gold mine of information because it usually contains a copy of 
the organization’s bylaws and articles of incorporation.
If the organization is too small to be required to file a 990-PF, and it has any
source of funds whatsoever, it should have some sort of accounting records.
These accounting records may be something as simple as a check register. If
the organization balks in providing you this information before you agree to
sit on the board, consider yourself warned because a red flag has been waved.
Many boards also keep minutes of their meetings. You can tell a lot about
what goes on during meetings from the minutes, such as what topics on the
agenda may have provoked detailed discussion. The minutes also reflect how
organized the board is in meeting its goals.
What’s the Organization’s 
Financial Situation?
One of the first things you want to look for is what money is coming into the
organization, and then you need to know where it’s going. If this information
isn’t clear to you from looking at the 990-PF or other available records, ask.
238
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Some other good questions to start investigating are in the following list:
 Overall budget: How large is the organization’s budget? The answer 
will tell you how much money the board is actually responsible for
administering.
 Allocation of funds: What percentage of program revenues goes directly
to programs as opposed to administrative expenses and overhead?
Generally speaking, the higher the percentage, the more effective the
organization.
 Salaries and expenses: Are the organization’s salaries and expenses rea-
sonable? This generally depends on the organization in relation to other
similar organizations. (See Chapter 6 for more on compensating officers
and directors.)
Is the Organization Current 
on Its Payroll Taxes?
One of the most important obligations of a nonprofit organization is to pay its
employees, along with any payroll taxes and other obligations. It’s important
to remember that a nonprofit’s tax-exempt status relates only to certain rev-
enues earned by the organization, not to the salaries and wages (see Chapter
5 for more on gaining tax-exempt status).
No federal income tax withholding is required in the cases of ministers and
members of religious orders. Their wages for religious duties aren’t subject
to mandatory withholding. But, any compensation not related to religious
duties is subject to federal income tax withholding. Their compensation is
also subject to self-employment tax, which is a responsibility of the individ-
ual, not of the church employer. In addition to federal requirements, state
and local jurisdictions may have their own requirements for withholding
amounts from employees’ wages.
In the event that a nonprofit organization fails to pay its taxes, the IRS can
impose substantial penalties on the organization. In theory, the board mem-
bers can be sued for allowing these penalties to pile up. If the organization
also fails to maintain its status as a nonprofit under state and federal law,
board members and directors can be held personally liable (because no
active corporate entity is in place to shield them), particularly if the board
has approved the use of the funds that were required to be withheld for 
other purposes.
239
Chapter 17: Ten Questions to Ask Before Agreeing to Join a Nonprofit Board

What Are the Responsibilities 
of the Directors?
Before you accept any position — paid or unpaid — it’s a good idea to know
what your responsibilities entail. Some boards are advisory only, which
means that they have little say or responsibility in the day-to-day manage-
ment of the organization. In fact, many boards leave day-to-day management
to the CEO, executive director, or other paid staff person, and this person
always reports back to the board. However, other boards are held to a high
degree of responsibility.
A common problem with respect to volunteer nonprofit boards is that 
the paid staff members may be held to vague standards of accountability
because volunteer board members may not view themselves as having the
same role as the directors when it comes to making sure that the mission 
of the organization is met. You may also find that when you join a board, 
you take on some new financial responsibilities. For example, you may be
required to make a minimum contribution to the organization, or you may
have to help make up shortfalls in the organization’s revenues at the end of
the year.
240
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
What tax-exempt organizations must withhold
Your nonprofit organization is responsible for
paying Social Security and Medicare taxes for
all employees earning $100 or more a year,
except ministers and members of religious
orders. (The exemption from Social Security and
Medicare taxes applies to services performed
by duly ordained members of a church in the
exercise of their ministry.)
The good news is that if your organization is tax-
exempt as provided under Section 501(c)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code (as discussed in
Chapter 5), it may be exempt from federal unem-
ployment taxes. For example, organizations
exempt from federal unemployment taxes gen-
erally include nonprofits that
 Are organized and operated exclusively for
religious, charitable, scientific, public
safety, literary, or educational purposes.
 Are operated for the prevention of cruelty to
children or animals.
 Are operated on a nonprofit basis.
 Have devoted no substantial part of their
activities to lobbying or political activities.
IRS Publication 15-A (Employer’s Supplemental
Tax Guide, Supplement to Circular E) explains the
federal unemployment tax withholding require-
ments and who is exempt from them and is avail-
able at www.IRS.gov/publications.

In most nonprofit organizations, however, board members’ duties consist of
at least some of the following:
 Determining the organization’s ongoing mission and purpose: This is
one of the key, universal roles of any board member.
 Selecting the executive director: Most boards (other than purely advi-
sory ones) have some role in hiring, firing, evaluating, and supervising
the executive directors.
 Overseeing organizational planning: This duty usually involves 
communicating with the executive director to ensure that the resources
and staff of the organization are used effectively to accomplish its 
mission.
 Raising funds and enhancing the public image of the organization:
Board members are often actively involved in soliciting funds for the
organization and raising its visibility on the public radar.
 Serving as a “court of appeal”: If staff and stakeholders believe that an
organization isn’t meeting its mission, it’s imperative that they’re able to
go to the board of directors with the issue.
When, Where, and How Often 
Does the Board Meet?
This may seem like a trivial question relative to other issues, but it can be a
key determining factor for recruiting board members, because as a practical
matter, in many organizations, it’s difficult to get a board to change its meet-
ing place or time. This can be critical in getting certain types of individuals 
to serve.
For example, a board that meets midday at a suburban venue may find 
itself hard-pressed to recruit directors that work downtown. On the other
hand, the meeting time and place may be ideal for a board comprised of 
stay-at-home parents or retirees. It’s increasingly common for organiza-
tions to allow meetings to take place by phone conference, but it’s far from
the norm.
Most boards that play active management roles in their organizations meet at
least monthly, and may convene additional meetings if emergencies arise.
241
Chapter 17: Ten Questions to Ask Before Agreeing to Join a Nonprofit Board

Is the Board Being Sued or 
Has It Ever Been Sued?
Litigation may be inevitable in some sound organizations, particularly in
those that deal with controversial causes, but pending lawsuits are some-
thing you definitely want to ask about and understand before you commit 
to a leadership role. Understanding pending lawsuits is important because,
personal liability issues aside, litigation is always distracting. It’s a sign of
conflict and it’s a diversion of organizational resources that could be used 
for the organization’s mission.
Most state laws shield directors of nonprofit organizations who are acting
within the scope of their authority from direct personal liability. Nevertheless,
a lawsuit is never a good thing. However, it becomes a problem when the
board is found to have exceeded its authority or to have taken actions that
have nothing to do with its mission.
For example, if a nonprofit board that deals with domestic abuse issues
decides it would be a great idea to publish the names of individuals the board
thinks are potentially abusive in a local newspaper, there’s a chance that the
board will be deemed to have acted outside the scope of its authority. If held
personally liable, the board members would have to defend the action on
their own or determine if their own professional liability insurance covered
the claim.

Ten Ways to Lose 
Tax-Exempt Status
In This Chapter
 Activities that nonprofits should avoid
 Laws that nonprofits must comply with
T
housands of organizations in the United States each year apply for and
receive tax-exempt recognition from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
Despite meeting the initial requirements, many of them later find themselves
in the throes of high-profile IRS investigations, which subject them to just
about the worst kind of publicity a nonprofit can get.
To keep you on track, this chapter warns you of ten actions that can quickly
put your organization in jeopardy of being excommunicated by the IRS and
ostracized by donors and other critical funding sources.
Engage in Plenty of Nonexempt Activities
Performing nonexempt activities (those activities that make a profit for your
nonprofit organization) is a surefire way to lose your tax-exempt status. A 
tax-exemption is analogous to a government subsidy for a worthy activity.
Nonprofit organizations are considered tax exempt because Congress has
chosen to support what they do, and it has told the IRS to give them a free
ride on the tax train.
But that free ride only lasts as long as the organizations are performing
exempt deeds — not the ones that compete with their private business 
counterparts (what an unfair advantage that would be!).

Some examples of nonprofit activities that the IRS may frown upon include
the following:
 Selling products and services that clearly compete with the private sector
 Conducting activities unrelated to the nonprofit mission
 Engaging in business activities that allow benefit board members to 
benefit or profit in a manner that’s a clear conflict of interest
A nonprofit organization must spell out its activities in its governing docu-
ments. These documents are called articles of incorporation, or some other
name, depending on what state you’re in. The articles must make clear that
the organization’s activities are pretty much limited to the exempt purposes.
The articles can’t authorize the organization to engage in substantial non-
exempt or profit-making activities.
For more information concerning types of charitable organizations and their
activities, download Publication 557 from the IRS Web site (www.irs.gov/
publications) or contact your local IRS office.
Get Involved in Prohibited 
Political Activities
Regardless of how sympathetic a particular pundit may be to the organization’s
mission, nonprofit organizations can’t use their funds to support political 
candidates.
Congress approved this ban on political campaign activity by charities and
churches in 1954. In 1987, Congress amended the language to clarify that the
prohibition also applies to statements in opposition of candidates.
Even though nonprofits can’t endorse political candidates, they can endorse
issues. Many nonprofits routinely lobby for issues in the political arena.
Nonprofits champion a variety of causes, and such advocacy may be their
primary mission. Here are a few examples:
 People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is an organization
whose primary mission is the advocacy of animal rights.
 The American Cancer Society is a nonprofit that’s visible in many states
and localities with respect to anti-smoking legislation.
244
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The IRS published Fact Sheet 2006-17, which outlines how churches and all
501(c)(3) organizations can stay within the law regarding the ban on political
activity. You can access this document on the IRS Web site at www.irs.
gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=154712,00.html.
Become a Partnership
Under 501(c)(3), a nonprofit organization must be some type of corporation
fund, association, or foundation. Partnerships aren’t on the IRS’s list of
acceptable legal entities. The legal types of nonprofit organizations are dis-
cussed in more detail in Chapter 5. A charitable trust is a fund or foundation
and will qualify, but sole proprietorships and partnerships don’t qualify and
need not apply!
Divert Some of Your Organization’s
Earnings to Private Individuals
Dole out money to private individuals within a nonprofit and you’ll lose your
tax-exempt status — pronto. In a nonprofit, no individual is supposed to have
his or her pockets lined with the organization’s money. Also, a legit nonprofit
organization can’t be operated for the benefit of private interests, such as the
people who created it, the creator’s family, or any sort of for-profit business
endeavor.
245
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Lose Tax-Exempt Status
How political activity can affect your 
nonprofit status: A real-life example
In September 2006, the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS) announced that it had revoked the nonprofit
501(c)(3) status of Youth Ministries, Inc., which
did business as Operation Rescue West (ORW).
The IRS generally doesn’t publish its reasons for
exempt status in detail, but the media speculated
that the organization pushed the limits of its
exemption by placing a large advertisement that
solicited tax-deductible donations to help
“defeat [John Kerry] in November and enable
President Bush to appoint a pro-life Supreme
Court Justice to finally overturn Roe v. Wade.”
The fate of ORW is a stark reminder that while
nonprofit organizations are free to educate
members and the public, they must do so within
the limits of charitable laws. Organizations that
want to directly participate in the election
process must renounce their charitable status.

This type of private benefit may be present in less obvious ways than direct
deposits to an officer’s bank account; it may be found to occur where there
are unjustifiable incidents of extravagant vacations, excessive compensation,
an insider’s purchase of the nonprofit’s assets for less than fair market value,
or other creative ways to milk the organization.
Farm Out Control of Your Operations
Tax-exempt organizations must manage their own affairs or have them man-
aged by other nonprofits. They can’t hire for-profit entities to manage their
operations or carry out their tax-exempt operations.
In a 2003 court battle (St. David’s Health Care System v. United States), an 
organization lost its tax-exempt status when it entered into a partnership joint
venture with a for-profit healthcare system. In this case, the court held that 
in such situations the nonprofit partner must have the “capacity to ensure
that the partnership’s operations further charitable purposes.” The court rea-
soned that a “nonprofit should lose its tax exempt status if it cedes control.”
Fail to Limit Your Commercial Activities
Nonprofits aren’t allowed to compete with private businesses on a tax-free basis
because doing so would give them a grossly unfair competitive advantage.
If your nonprofit engages in a business venture that’s unrelated to its purpose
(like operating a pizza parlor when its mission is to help fund medical research
projects), the profits from that venture are taxable. However, if the organization
as a whole has too much taxable income, it may lose its tax-exempt status 
altogether. For this reason, successful nonprofit groups, such as the National
Geographic Society, have had to spin off business projects that became too
profitable.
Require Donations in Exchange for 
Your Organization’s Services
In 2006, the IRS revoked the tax-exempt status of many nonprofit, down-
payment assistance organizations that were operating under the guise of
charitable organizations but were requiring applicants to make a “donation.”
246
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Often these mandatory donations were really fees for commercial services.
For example, certain down payment assistance and credit counseling pro-
grams have lost their tax-exempt status in recent years by channeling funds
to mortgage companies, brokers, and other private parties.
Skip Filing IRS Form 990 
for Three Years in a Row
On August 17, 2006, President Bush signed into law the Pension Protection
Act of 2006. Under the new law, a nonprofit’s tax-exempt status is automati-
cally revoked if the organization fails to file a Form 990 for three years in a
row (flip to Chapter 7 for more details on Form 990s). After they have their
status revoked, these organizations have to reapply for exempt status (which
is no easy job) or show reasonable cause for failure to file the return.
Worse yet, under this law, the IRS publishes a list of the organizations that
have had their tax-exempt status revoked. The IRS even notifies the state
charity officials of the organization’s change in status, free of charge, so the
state can take appropriate action.
The law doesn’t say as much, but because the IRS publishes a notice that 
a charity’s exemption is revoked, it’s pretty much assumed that a donor 
who makes a gift to a charity that’s on the public shaming list isn’t entitled 
to a charitable deduction. And of course, as you probably can imagine, caus-
ing a donor to lose out on tax deductions is a fabulous way to tarnish your
reputation.
Support Terrorist Activities
Terrorism isn’t an exempt activity. You won’t find it listed under Section
501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code.
But seriously, all joking aside, multinational organizations or organizations
who aid in charitable causes overseas are facing strict scrutiny in this area. 
In this day and age, companies that make contributions are responsible for
understanding counter-terrorism regulations, and making sure that their 
well-intentioned dollars don’t benefit terrorists or terrorist organizations.
Executive Order 13224, straight from the President, freezes the assets of 
individuals and organizations that support terrorism, knowingly or other-
wise. Corporations can run into trouble if they have a program of matching
employee donations and inadvertently let some slip through to terrorist 
organizations.
247
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Lose Tax-Exempt Status

Pay Your Executives Exorbitant Salaries
The IRS has issued a number of guidelines as to when executive compensa-
tion is deemed excessive and when an organization has run afoul of its chari-
table mission as a result. Nonprofits are required to report salaries on their
tax returns, and services like GuideStar post tax returns of nonprofits on the
Internet so the public can assess this information as well. (Check out Chapter
6 for more info on compensating your officers and directors.)
IRS policies also address freebie fringe benefits, such as paid vacations,
spousal travel, and golf outings. And don’t forget that the IRS also frowns on
transactions that create a conflict of interest. For example, personal loans to
directors or executives, as discussed in Chapter 6, are no-nos.

Ten Tips for Dealing 
with the Media
In This Chapter
 Handling the media effectively
 Using the media to your advantage
 Presenting your nonprofit through the media
M
ost nonprofit organizations need to use the media or have its spotlight
cast on them at some point during their existence. It may be an ongo-
ing relationship or only a quick 15 minutes of fame. Regardless of the nature
and extent to which your organization wants or gets media attention, there
are certain tips that can help improve the experience and give you an edge in
maximizing the opportunity to offer your story to the world. While many of
the tips in this chapter may apply to any type of organization, those organiza-
tions involved in fundraising or consciousness-raising activities should find
these tips particularly thought-provoking and hopefully useful as well.
Acquaint Yourself with Your Local Media
Before you assess how to deal with the media, you need to fundamentally
understand what media outlets may be listening to (or looking at) your orga-
nization. Review the likely radio stations, television channels, and local and
regional newspapers. Get to know the reporters and television personalities,
and determine what their reporting styles may be. This study of the media is
crucial when evaluating who to talk to about your story, and how to spin it.
By carefully choosing who to approach about a particular matter, you can
maximize the opportunity to expose your announcement or news story to
the right audience at the right time.

Create Your Message
If you have important news that needs to be covered, it has to be interesting.
And developing the right message to make your pitch to the media is the key
to success. Make your message short and sweet to get the media person’s
attention, and have backup information on hand with all the correct facts 
in order. By doing so, you give yourself a good chance at getting the right
person to listen to your story and report it with the message you craft —
rather than having the wrong message sent to your intended audience.
Be Prepared When Being Interviewed
Imagine that you’ve successfully created interest in your story, and a reporter
asks you for an interview. One of the first things you need to find out is what
interest the interviewer has in the story. Once you know this fact, you can
formulate the message in a way that helps them with their mission. Create a
loose script that includes bullet points you want to cover, making sure that
the most important points are first. If the interview is conducted over the
phone (as are most newspaper and radio interviews), feel free to grab pre-
pared materials and read your sound bite directly from them.
In any event, make sure that your message is delivered — and don’t be timid
about repeating your most important point or points. Repetition emphasizes
the importance of these points and highlights your areas of concern to the
reporter.
Keep Control of the Story
If you have a message that causes a stir, or if something causes the media to
focus on your organization, keep control of the story. In other words, make
sure that you’re ready with the right answers to the questions that you know
reporters will ask. The most media-savvy people within an organization know
how to steer an answer. In answering a tough question, these smooth-talkers
can address the primary issue succinctly, and then move on to a topic that’s
part of the story but hasn’t yet been covered. It’s a sure-fire, time-tested method
that you can hear whenever you listen to a politician being interviewed, a
lawyer publicly commenting on a big case, or a government official talking
about some issue within his or her department.
250
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Don’t Avoid the Press
The rules on dealing with the media don’t change when you’re in a crisis situ-
ation. One of the worst public relations moves an organization can make is to
attempt to avoid the media. We’ve all seen on television a person cornered by
a mob of reporters while making a mad dash to an awaiting car, only to lean
briefly into a sea of microphones and say “No comment” before being whisked
away. What inevitably follows this disastrous clip is the local media reporter
summarizing the story that the person refused to comment on, and (if the
reporter is doing his or her job correctly) making the story as interesting as
possible. Unfortunately, this good reporting job usually means commenting
on suspected scandal, insinuating criminal activity or embezzlement, or spec-
ulating on whatever other facts may relate to the story and catch the public’s
interest.
If the media approaches you and you aren’t ready to comment, don’t avoid
them. Instead, tell them you want to address all of their concerns directly,
and then you can schedule a press conference or other meeting to do just
that. This tactic gives your organization the time to decide how to create the
message, control the story, and consult with a media specialist, if necessary,
to make sure that the opportunity to comment is maximized and becomes a
positive for the organization.
Hire Professional PR Help 
When Necessary
Depending on the size of your organization’s operating budget, its mission,
and its specific situation, you may consider hiring a public relations (PR) pro-
fessional. Good PR firms have people who are well-connected and wired into
the network of media people. They know each other by first name and have
instant access at the appropriate times. These PR professionals can help you
form your message and can coach you on how to deliver it. They prepare the
press releases, the campaign slogans, the handout materials, or any other
media-related functions you need. If you can afford these professionals, we
highly suggest that you invest in them. They function and assist as effectively
in fundraising campaigns as they do in organizational emergencies. Sometimes,
even for smaller organizations, it’s well worth the money to get a professional
involved.
251
Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Dealing with the Media

Remember That Nothing 
Is Ever “Off the Record”
We’ve all seen those outtakes where an unsuspecting person thought that the
camera was no longer rolling and proceeded to make some stupid remark
that was completely contrary to what he or she was just saying, framing him
or her, at best, as some sort of non-credible source or, at worst, some sort of
hypocritical buffoon. If these folks had control over the camera or micro-
phone, they’d never be put into compromising situations. So too, it is with
the press.
When you say “This is off the record” or someone tells you during an inter-
view that something they say is off the record, it really isn’t. Nothing is ever
off the record. In fact, that’s when the reporters sharpen their pencils and
pay the most attention. They’re just hoping that your guard will be down and
you’ll let something slip. If you need to comment on anything off the record,
keep control of the story and answer the question in a manner that leads the
story where you want it to go.
Gather the Forces When Appropriate
Whether you want to get the word out about a fundraising event or about your
organization’s position on a controversial issue, a highly effective method of
disseminating that information is through your staff and volunteers. Find out
which people in these groups are willing to speak and tour the circuit of public
forums to get the message out. Not only does this get the word out on the
street, but it also raises the visibility of your organization within the commu-
nity and lets others know more about your mission and philosophy.
One note of caution: Speakers are representatives of the organization, and
their audiences will form opinions of the speakers and associate your organi-
zation with that opinion. So, make your speaker selections carefully! Tell
them that they are the message.
Know the Difference between 
News and Advertising
This tip seems intuitive, but on slow news days you can always see old news
stories that are simply being rehashed. Some of these stories come close to
252
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

being thinly veiled advertisements for how well a company is doing or for pro-
moting its line of products. We aren’t saying that these stories aren’t newswor-
thy, but there’s definitely a time and a place for everything — and the time to
break a news story is when it’s fresh, not months or years old. For example, if
you plan to hire a new CEO for your organization, that’s news on or before the
date it actually happens, but it becomes advertising to run the story months
afterward.
Even a newbie reporter can see through ploys, so save your credibility and
know what’s newsworthy and what’s not.
Surf the ’Net
You can pick up a lot of great public relations tips and strategies simply by
surfing the Web sites of organizations that have the resources to hire the
biggest and best public relations firms.
Whether you’re a sophisticated national public charity or a community-based
club, your organization probably has a Web site. You can bet most other non-
profits have them too, and they probably use them as major public relations
tools. Many also post their press releases on their Web sites. You can take a
look at what other organizations similar to yours are doing regarding Web
designs, blogging, and media blitzing.

Appendix D: Selections from the Revised Model Nonprofit Corporation Act (1987)

Subchapter C: Standards of Conduct
Section 8.30. General Standards for Directors.
(a) A director shall discharge his or her duties as a director, including his or
her duties as a member of a committee:
(1) in good faith;
(2) with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exer-
cise under similar circumstances; and
(3) in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of
the corporation.
(b) In discharging his or her duties, a director is entitled to rely on informa-
tion, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and
other financial data, if prepared or presented by:
(1) one or more officers or employees of the corporation whom the director
reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;
(2) legal counsel, public accountants or other persons as to matters the
director reasonably believes are within the person’s professional or expert
competence;
(3) a committee of the board of which the director is not a member, as to
matters within its jurisdiction, if the director reasonably believes the commit-
tee merits confidence; or
(4) in the case of religious corporations, religious authorities and ministers,
priests, rabbis or other persons whose position or duties in the religious
organization the director believes justify reliance and confidence and whom
the director believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented.
(c) A director is not acting in good faith if the director has knowledge con-
cerning the matter in question that makes reliance otherwise permitted by
subsection (b) unwarranted.
(d) A director is not liable to the corporation, any member, or any other
person for any action taken or not taken as a director, if the director acted in
compliance with this section.
(e) A director shall not be deemed to be a trustee with respect to the corpo-
ration or with respect to any property held or administered by the corpora-

280
Part VII: Appendixes 

Section 8.31. Director Conflict of Interest.
(a) A conflict of interest transaction is a transaction with the corporation in
which a director of the corporation has a direct or indirect interest. A conflict
of interest transaction is not voidable or the basis for imposing liability on
the director if the transaction was fair at the time it was entered into or is
approved as provided in subsections (b) or (c).
(b) A transaction in which a director of a public benefit or religious corpora-
tion has a conflict of interest may be approved:
(1) in advance by the vote of the board of directors or a committee of the
board if:
(i) the material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest are dis-
closed or known to the board or committee of the board; and
(ii) the directors approving the transaction in good faith reasonably believe
that the transaction is fair to the corporation; or
(2) before or after it is consummated by obtaining approval of the:
(i) attorney general; or
(ii) [describe or name] court in an action in which the attorney general is
joined as a party; or
(c) A transaction in which a director of a mutual benefit corporation has a
conflict of interest may be approved if;
(1) the material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were dis-
closed or known to the board of directors or a committee of the board and
the board or committee of the board authorized, approved, or ratified the
transaction; or
(2) the material facts of the transaction and the director’s interest were dis-
closed or known to the members and they authorized, approved, or ratified
the transaction.
(d) For purposes of this section, a director of the corporation has an indirect
interest in a transaction if (1) another entity in which the director has a mate-
rial interest or in which the director is a general partner is a party to the
transaction or (2) another entity of which the director is a director, officer, 
or trustee is a party to the transaction.
281
Appendix D: Selections from the Revised Model Nonprofit Corporation Act (1987)

(e) For purposes of subsections (b) and (c) a conflict of interest transaction
is authorized, approved, or ratified, if it receives the affirmative vote of a
majority of the directors on the board or on the committee, who have no
direct or indirect interest in the transaction, but a transaction may not be
authorized, approved, or ratified under this section by a single director. If a
majority of the directors on the board who have no direct or indirect interest
in the transaction vote to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a
quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The
presence of, or a vote cast by, a director with a direct or indirect interest in
the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under subsec-
tions (b)(1) or (c)(1) if the transaction is otherwise approved as provided in
subsection (b) or (c).
(f) For purposes of subsection (c)(2), a conflict of interest transaction is
authorized, approved, or ratified by the members if it receives a majority 
of the votes entitled to be counted under this subsection. Votes cast by or
voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect interest 
in the transaction, and votes cast by or voted under the control of an entity
described in subsection (d)(1), may not be counted in a vote of members 
to determine whether to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict of interest
transaction under subsection (c)(2). The vote of these members, however, is
counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other sec-
tions of this Act. A majority of the voting power, whether or not present, that

Subchapter E: Indemnification
Section 8.50. Subchapter Definitions.
In this subchapter:
(1) “Corporation” includes any domestic or foreign predecessor entity of a
corporation in a merger or other transaction in which the predecessor’s exis-
tence ceased upon consummation of the transaction.

the corporation’s request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, 
or agent of another foreign or domestic business or nonprofit corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise.
A director is considered to be serving an employee benefit plan at the corpo-
ration’s request if the director’s duties to the corporation also impose duties
on, or otherwise involve services by, the director to the plan or to partici-
pants in or beneficiaries of the plan. “Director” includes, unless the context
requires otherwise, the estate or personal representative of a director.
(3) “Expenses” include counsel fees.
(4) “Liability” means the obligation to pay a judgment, settlement, penalty,
fine (including an excise tax assessed with respect to an employee benefit
plan), or reasonable expenses actually incurred with respect to a proceeding.
(5) “Official capacity” means: (i) when used with respect to a director, the
office of director in a corporation; and (ii) when used with respect to an indi-
vidual other than a director, as contemplated in section 8.56, the office in a
corporation held by the officer or the employment or agency relationship
undertaken by the employee or agent on behalf of the corporation. “Official
capacity” does not include service for any other foreign or domestic business
or nonprofit corporation or any partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan, or other enterprise.
(6) “Party” includes an individual who was, is or is threatened to be made a
named defendant or respondent in a proceeding.
(7) “Proceeding” means any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit or
proceeding whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative and
whether formal or informal.

Section 8.51. Authority To Indemnify.
(a) Except as provided in subsection (d), a corporation may indemnify an
individual made a party to a proceeding because the individual is or was a
director against liability incurred in the proceeding if the individual:
(1) conducted himself or herself in good faith; and
(2) reasonably believed:
(i) in the case of conduct in his or her official capacity with the corporation,
that his or her conduct was in its best interests; and
(ii) in all other cases, that his or her conduct was at least not opposed to its
best interests; and
(3) in the case of any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to
believe his or her conduct was unlawful.
(b) A director’s conduct with respect to an employee benefit plan for a purpose
the director reasonably believed to be in the interests of the participants in
and beneficiaries of the plan is conduct that satisfies the requirements of sub-
section (a)(2)(ii).
(c) The termination of a proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, convic-
tion, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent is not, of itself, deter-
minative that the director did not meet the standard of conduct described in
this section.
(d) A corporation may not indemnify a director under this section:
(1) in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation in
which the director was adjudged liable to the corporation; or

benefit to the director, whether or not involving action in his or her official
capacity, in which the director was adjudged liable on the basis that personal

proceeding by or in the right of the corporation is limited to reasonable
expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding.

a director who was wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the

ally incurred by the director in connection with the proceeding.

good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct described in
section 8.51;
(2) the director furnishes the corporation a written undertaking, executed
personally or on the director’s behalf, to repay the advance if it is ultimately
determined that the director did not meet the standard of conduct; and

determination would not preclude indemnification under this subchapter.
(b) The undertaking required by subsection (a)(2) must be an unlimited gen-
eral obligation of the director but need not be secured and may be accepted
without reference to financial ability to make repayment.

be made in the manner specified in section 8.55.

the court conducting the proceeding or to another court of competent juris-
diction. On receipt of an application, the court after giving any notice the
court considers necessary may order indemnification in the amount it con-
siders proper if it determines:
(1) the director is entitled to mandatory indemnification under section 8.52,
in which case the court shall also order the corporation to pay the director’s
reasonable expenses incurred to obtain court-ordered indemnification; or
(2) the director is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of
all the relevant circumstances, whether or not the director met the standard
of conduct set forth in section 8.51(a) or was adjudged liable as described in
section 8.51(d), but if the director was adjudged so liable indemnification is
limited to reasonable expenses incurred.
Section 8.55. Determination and Authorization of Indemnification.
(a) A corporation may not indemnify a director under section 8.51 unless
authorized in the specific case after a determination has been made that
indemnification of the director is permissible in the circumstances because
the director has met the standard of conduct set forth in section 8.51.
287

directors not at the time parties to the proceeding;
(3) by special legal counsel:

scribed in subdivision (1) or (2); or

the time parties to the proceeding may not vote on the determination.

expenses shall be made in the same manner as the determination that indem-
nification is permissible, except that if the determination is made by special

tory indemnification under section 8.52, and is entitled to apply for court-
ordered indemnification under section 8.54 in each case, to the same extent
as a director;
(2) the corporation may indemnify and advance expenses under this sub-
chapter to an officer, employee, or agent of the corporation who is not a

poration, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other
enterprise, against liability asserted against or incurred by him or her in that
capacity or arising from his or her status as a director, officer, employee, or
agent, whether or not the corporation would have power to indemnify the
person against the same liability under section 8.51 or 8.52.

(a) A provision treating a corporation’s indemnification of or advance for
expenses to directors that is contained in its articles of incorporation,
bylaws, a resolution of its members or board of directors, or in a contract or
otherwise, is valid only if and to the extent the provision is consistent with

for expenses, indemnification and advance for expenses are valid only to the
extent consistent with the articles.
(b) This subchapter does not limit a corporation’s power to pay or reimburse

tory proof of entitlement to the amount deposited or property held in kind,
