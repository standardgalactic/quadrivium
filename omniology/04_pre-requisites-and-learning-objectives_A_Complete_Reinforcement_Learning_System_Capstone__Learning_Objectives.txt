Understand the reward function that you need to implement.  
Use the Lunar Lander environment 
 
Milestone 2: Choosing The Right Algorithm 
 
Weekly Learning Goals 
Understand​ ​how to solve this MDP by deciding which of the many algorithms you have 
learned about are a good fit for this problem. 
 
Milestone 3: Identify Key Performance Parameters   
 
Weekly Learning Goals 
Discuss the meta-parameter choices that you will have to make to fully implement the 
agent.  
Decide on the function approximator 
Understand choices in the optimizer for updating the action-values and how to do 
exploration
