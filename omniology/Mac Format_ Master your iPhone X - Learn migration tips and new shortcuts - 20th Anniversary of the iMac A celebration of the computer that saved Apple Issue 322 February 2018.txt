Weak passwords are a massive security problem, but creating (and remembering) a bunch 
of complex logins is difficult. The Identity Vault card aims to make it easy. It’s a mini computer 
that’s shaped like a credit card, so it’s easy to carry around with you. It can generate and store 
secure passwords – when you’re ready to log in, simply hold it up to your device and it wirelessly 
transmits the details. It never connects to Wi-Fi or mobile networks, nothing is stored in the cloud, 
and all your passwords are locked behind a passphrase or your biometric data.
 From $69.95 (about £53)  INCLUDES Identity Vault card, magnetic USB charging cable

 Can you believe it’s been 20 years 
since the iMac G3 made its mark on 
the world? In this issue, we look back 
at the history and huge impact of 
Apple’s all-in-one desktop computer.
I remember using the Bondi Blue 
beauty at my ﬁrst workplace. I didn’t 
like its mouse at all, but I was taken in 
by the neatness of the whole package. 
My favourite iMac is still the G4. Wow, 
what a classy computer that was! 
Sadly, I never actually owned one. 
Our cover feature looks at the major iterations of the iMac, 
talks about the computer’s impact on the world, and includes 
insights from the likes of Steve Jobs and Sir Jonathan Ive.
Whether you’re skipping iPhone X or have embraced it 
already, our second feature in this issue is worth your time. 
Its forsaking of the Home button is sure to inﬂuence future 
iOS devices, including iPad. Our user guide teaches you the 
new button combinations and gestures used for screenshots, 
power off in a cinema or on a ﬂight (yes, really, that has a new 
button combination!), call upon Apple Pay, and more.
The Apple Skills section is expanded as of this issue to 
help you get even more from your Apple kit, and you’ll ﬁnd 
the usual buffet of news, reviews and advice throughout, too.

 We reminisce about 
iMacs of our time
The starting price is £4,899,  
making it Apple’s most  
expensive product in years
The iMac Pro has landed
onths after its exciting reveal at 
WWDC, Apple has finally launched 
the iMac Pro here in the UK. The 
most powerful iMac ever released is a real 
beast of a machine, ideally suited to the heavy 
workloads of demanding users. But it’s also 
more than that – it’s a statement that Apple 
hasn’t given up on its pro customers, and is 
as devoted to them as ever.
So just how powerful is it? The default 
configuration comes with an 8-core Intel Xeon 
processor, which can be boosted up to 10, 14 or 
even 18 cores if you really have some heavy-
duty work on your hands.
The standard graphics processor is an 
AMD Vega 56 with 8GB of HBM2 (second-gen 
High Bandwidth Memory). Or you can choose  
a Vega 64 with a huge 16GB of memory.
You can have 32GB, 64GB or 128GB of 
ECC memory on board, so you’ll never have 
to worry about multitasking slowing down the 
machine. The iMac Pro comes with a 1TB SSD, 
configurable up to a 4TB of super-speedy flash 
storage for an astonishing £2,520 extra.
When it comes to expansion, the iMac Pro 
comes with four Thunderbolt 3 ports with 
transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps, four USB 3 
(Type-A) ports, a 10Gb Ethernet port, an SDXC 
card slot and a 3.5mm headphone jack.
The iMac Pro comes in a space grey 
finish, as does its included accessories: 
a full-size Magic Keyboard, a Magic Mouse 
2 and a Magic Trackpad 2.
And, of course, you’ve got the stunning 
5K display, which lets you edit a full-size 
4K image with plenty of room to spare.
Pure power
Naturally, none of that comes cheap. The 
starting price for the iMac Pro is £4,899, 
making it Apple’s most expensive product in 
years. Buying one of these computers is not a 
decision that will come lightly to most people.
That said, considering what you get, it’s 
not actually an extortionate price to pay. Apple 
claimed at WWDC that a similarly equipped PC 
would set you back about $7,000, while other 
outlets have pegged the equivalent cost at 
around the $5,000 mark. Either way, high-
quality components command a high price, 
and you get your money’s worth with Apple’s 
high-end, all-in-one machine.
Building a PC that is, on paper at least, 
equivalent to the iMac Pro also misses out on 
some key features you get in Apple’s 
machine. Most obviously, there’s 
macOS and its tight integration with 
the iMac Pro’s hardware, especially 
given changes implemented in High 
Sierra. This affects a range of things,

such as using the graphics processor and 
Metal 2 to support VR content creation, 
and exporting 8-bit HEVC video files three 
times faster than the regular iMac.
The iMac Pro is also the first Mac to 
feature Apple’s T2 chip. This integrates 
several system controllers – such as those 
responsible for the SSD, audio and image 
signal processing – into a single place, 
allowing for functionality not possible on 
older Macs. For example, the data on the 
iMac Pro’s SSD can now be encrypted 
thanks to the dedicated hardware without 
impacting the performance of the drive or 
the Xeon processor. Similarly, the image 
signal processor on the T2 chip works 
alongside the FaceTime HD camera to 
enable ‘enhanced tone mapping, improved 
exposure control, and face detection–
based auto exposure and auto white 
balance’, according to Apple.
Memory test
Despite the power lurking inside the 
iMac Pro, some users may feel the 
need to upgrade certain aspects of it, 
particularly the memory. On Apple’s 
Retina 5K iMac there is a hatch on the 
back allowing you to access the memory, 
but this is missing on the iMac Pro.
What that means is that upgrading 
any part of the iMac Pro is very difficult 
to do yourself and would require major 
disassembly. However, the memory can 
be upgraded at an Apple Store or by an 
Apple Authorised Service Provider after 
you’ve purchased an iMac Pro.
The iMac Pro comes with 32GB of 
memory as standard. Upgrading to 64GB 
costs £720; 128GB will set you back 
£2,160. Anyone investing in an iMac Pro 
should carefully consider how much 
memory they require before buying.
Apple buys 
music app 
Shazam
 In a move that is likely 
to strengthen its machine 
learning efforts, Apple has 
bought music-recognition 
app Shazam for a reported 
$400 million.
Shazam is used to identify 
songs, films, TV shows and 
adverts from short audio 
clips. In a statement to The 
Verge, Apple described how 
Shazam’s technology is a 
‘natural fit’ for Apple Music 
thanks to its music discovery 
potential. Additionally, its tech 
might be further integrated 
into Siri in the future.
Shazam’s app also has 
augmented reality features, 
letting users scan QR-like 
codes in order to access 
special content. 
With high-end workstation 
specs, the iMac Pro is the 
most powerful Mac Apple 
has ever released.
Unlike the silver ﬁnish 
of regular iMacs, the iMac 
Pro comes in space grey.

atcher Technology, the company that 
manufacturers the chassis for Apple’s 
laptops, is apparently working on a new 
product category. The news, confirmed by Catcher 
chairman Allen Horng, has led to speculation that it 
could be working on an augmented reality (AR) headset. 
Since Apple is one of Catcher’s major clients, there 
has also been some speculation that if Catcher is indeed 
working on an AR headset, it could be for Apple. It is no 
secret that Apple is very interested in AR, although it has 
remained tight-lipped about any sort of headset that it 
may or may not be working on.
Quanta, a second Apple supplier, has signed a deal 
to produce lenses to be used in AR parts for Lumus. 
However, the deal also lets it manufacture these parts 
for other companies as well, which may include Apple. 
Quanta has signalled that it wants to have AR technology 
on the market by 2019, but that may be a little too early for 
Apple. Still, the capability will soon be in place to make 
AR products for Apple if necessary.

Could an Apple augmented reality 
headset be in development?
A
pple’s machine learning efforts 
were recently outlined in detail 
at an artificial intelligence (AI) 
industry conference. The talk, by Apple’s 
director of AI research Ruslan Salakhutdinov, 
discussed how information from cameras and 
sensors could be used to spot pedestrians and 
cars on the road. It also covered topics such as 
using this data to aid navigation in unfamiliar 
areas, and how it can be used to build detailed 
3D maps of cities.
Salakhutdinov showed how the AI system 
performed well even when raindrops partly 
covered the camera’s lens, or when people are 
partially obscured by cars.
Apple details its machine learning efforts
 The first text message 
was sent on 3 December 
1992, when engineer 
Neil Papworth typed 
out ‘Merry Christmas’ 
on his computer and 
sent it to Vodafone 
director Richard Jarvis. 
A lot has changed since 
then, with iMessage, 
memes and even 
Animojis playing their 
part. And by June 2017, 
781 billion texts were 
sent every month 
in the US alone. 
 Apple has long held off 
from letting developers 
offer apps as pre-orders 
on the App Store, but 
that’s now set to 
change. Apps can be 
made available to 
pre-order if their release 
date is between two and 
90 days in the future. 
When the app is 
pre-ordered, it will be 
downloaded to your 
device once it becomes 
available. Introductory 
pricing options for 
subscriptions are also 
now generally available.

Interestingly, a lot of the machine learning 
projects discussed by Salakhutdinov have 
applications in autonomous vehicles, which 
Apple is reportedly interested in. However, 
other topics were also on the bill.
For instance, the various machine learning 
capabilities of Siri were covered, while Carlos 
Guestrin, Apple’s director of machine learning, 
explained how engineers who join Apple will 
be granted access to powerful systems and large 
datasets to conduct their research. He also won 
applause for confirming that Apple is releasing 
open-source machine learning software that 
was developed by his startup Turi, which Apple 
acquired in 2016. 
Apple has long been rumoured to be working 
on an augmented reality headset.

INVESTIGATES
 macformat.com  @macformat
Alan Stonebridge discusses the experience of adapting 
to the new tech and interactions in Apple’s latest phone
iPhone X: long term
aving used iPhone X since 
launch day, we wanted to 
relay longer term experiences 
of what it’s like to use, and 
dispel some myths around how apps and 
media look on its unusual screen ratio. 
Much of what’s explained here comes from 
use over the days, weeks and months that 
follow a device launch, as developers update 
apps to better use the hardware and take into 
account features unique to iPhone X, in 
particular the notch and rounded corners.
The adjustment period for getting used 
to accessing the Home screen and the app 
switcher with on-screen gestures passed 
quickly for us. Swiping up to reach the Home 
screen or app switcher so soon feels natural 
that after just a couple of days we found 
ourselves attempting the gestures on iPad. 
Despite that, there’s one control that 
stands out as particularly awkward: invoking 
the Reachability feature, which pulls down 
the screen’s contents to make things near the 
top easier to reach in one-handed operation. 
Previously this used a double-tap on the 
Home button, but on iPhone X it’s done by 
swiping down very near to the screen’s 
bottom edge. That feels precarious, especially 
when walking, and as we’re cautious about 
the impact a tumble might have on the phone’s 
glass body. Given repair costs detailed in last 
issue’s MacFormat Investigates, we prefer to 
use iPhone X with two hands in that situation.
Face ID
Industrious people didn’t waste time in 
trying to crack Face ID, going so far as to use 
3D masks to break through it. For now at 
least, doing that is an involved process that’s 
unlikely to be used against the average iPhone 
owner, and our greater concern was whether 
Face ID is reliable and fast enough to be a 
comfortable replacement for Touch ID.
For the most part we say yes, though in 
our first few weeks of using iPhone X we were 
frustrated by it rejecting our face more often 
than expected. Face ID would prompt for our 
password – long and complex, not just a 
six-digit code, and so not always convenient. 
This request wasn’t the security measure 
whereby iPhone X reverts to only accepting 
a password or passcode due to multiple failed 
facial unlocks, though; turning the iPhone 
away for a moment and then back at our face 
usually corrected the failure and unlocked 
the device. Whatever the underlying reason, 
rejections settled down in time.
After about six weeks of use, we reset 
Face ID to start over and found that maybe 
the original scan of our face was suboptimal; 
with a fresh start based on more exaggerated 
movement to scan the periphery of our face, 
we didn’t encounter rejections with anything 
like the same regularity. So, if iPhone X 
thinks you’re not you too often, try using the 
reset option in its settings and starting over. 
Failing that, Face ID is designed to update its

model of your face when you correctly enter 
your passcode after a failed identification, 
which would help explain why our rejections 
went down over time.
Video presentation
The unusual screen format on iPhone X raises 
questions about media presentation, so 
clarification is in order in case you haven’t 
seen first-hand how things work. Video does 
not fill the entire screen by default; instead, 
there are narrow black borders down the left 
and right of the screen (in landscape), serving 
as a place for your thumbs to rest without 
obscuring the video, just like the large bezel 
on previous iPhone designs, and rendering 
the notch essentially invisible.
You can double-tap to have video fill the 
screen, which reframes it by a small amount, 
losing some at one side and to the rounded 
corners (though the latter is by far easier to 
ignore). What looks really odd is that some of 
the video runs just above and below the notch, 
emphasising its presence and leaving some of 
the picture hidden. You’re better off sticking 
to the default, non-zoomed presentation.
Adaptable 
Apple has applied sensible defaults to the way 
videos and older apps are presented on the 
new screen ratio. Many developers have taken 
swift action in making good use of the display, 
helped by groundwork Apple already laid to 
adapt interfaces to different screens.
Face ID quickly proves to be a strong 
alternative to Touch ID. Combined with iOS’s 
ability to hide the contents of notifications on 
the Lock screen until a device is unlocked, the 
result is a phone that feels less bogged down 
by old-fashioned mechanical processes.
We’ve seen suggestions that iPhone X is 
to be skipped because of it’s first-gen tech, but 
Apple’s years of research and development, 
and its prior experience in smoothing 
transitions to new device sizes, have made 
any such concerns fade quickly for us.
Apps deal with iPhone X’s wider 
aspect ratio in various ways – if 
they do so at all. Apps not updated 
are centred and framed with black. 
That works, but if you use one that’s 
unlikely to be updated, you might 
decide this is a good time to look at 
replacements that’ll make full use of 
the display you’ve paid so much for.
Don’t assume that games that 
have been updated to fill the screen 
will look their best; that depends on 
the approach taken by developers. 
Take Sega’s Sonic the Hedgehog: 
the game world, but not info overlaid 
on it, is stretched, distorting the 
graphics. Though not ruinous, it isn’t 
ideal, especially when you consider 
that in this game the protagonist 
should be circular when doing his 
signature move. It’s not a respectful 
adaptation; we’d rather the view was 
pillarboxed, and the controls able to 
be moved further outwards.
Thankfully not all developers are 
taking this crude approach, but you 
have little or no influence, beyond 
airing opinions in App Store reviews.
Apps and games
If your iPhone X is lying 
ﬂat on a table, Face ID 
won’t work – you need 
to lift the phone.

High Sierra doesn’t kill off 32-bit apps; 
Apple has said it’s the last version of macOS 
that will run them ‘without compromise’, so 
the problem with iDVD must originate with 
some other change. Existing apps in the Mac 
App Store must be 64-bit from July.
As for Toast, a Roxio spokesperson told 
us: “While we don’t typically pre-announce 
our product plans, we want to confirm that 
we’re working to update the Toast product 
family for 64-bit. We can’t provide specific 
details yet, but as soon as we have more 
information, we’ll be sure to let our 
community know.”
FileMaker No
 FileMaker Pro is a great product. While it 
is cross-platform, it is 100 per cent owned by 
Apple. One thing that confuses me is why it 
isn’t available on the Mac App Store? As a 
major piece of Apple software, surely this 
should be available.

PAUL SAYS… You’re not alone in wondering 
this; a quick Google search directed us to 
forum discussions asking the same question. 
Some of the reasons expressed in responses 
there, about the app’s extensive capabilities, 
align with what we think might be the cause 
of FileMaker Pro’s unavailability from Apple’s

sandboxing being imposed on apps.

A family legacy
Although I appreciate Apple’s march to 
the future, and generally applaud it moving 
into 64-bit software only, this has caused 
a few issues. I was able to use iDVD as an 
excellent, simple DVD authoring system, 
as there are a number of home movies 
that I want to turn into semi-professional 
looking DVDs with menus. However, this 
app is incompatible with High Sierra.
Is there a DVD authoring tool that’s simple but offers enough features 
to be able to do this? ‘Free’ options I’ve tried were woefully inadequate. 
Researching the issue brings up either glowing, badly spelled reviews for 
what appears to be bloatware that I’m finding difficult to trust, or costly 
pro solutions like Roxio Toast, which also may not work as it is 32-bit.
I know that videos are mostly streamed these days, but not everyone 
wants to watch exclusively via tablet or computer, especially older people, 
and a USB stick can’t be packaged in a case and printed on at home to 
make it look like a half-decent gift. I’d be grateful of suggestions.
B Y  G A R Y  D E P L A N Q U E
ALAN SAYS… I once paid handsomely to transfer old cine-camera 
footage to a format I could turn into a DVD, in order to give my parents 
a personal gift, precisely because they were more likely to pick a disc off 
a shelf and pop it in a player than navigate 
apps and menus on their iPod touch and 
send it to their TV. While video files are 
easy to back up and likely, in H.264 format, 
to be playable for years to come, a physical 
artefact of one’s life has special appeal – 
at least if you grew up with physical media.
Something you might try in order to 
keep iDVD and other old apps running is to 
install Sierra in a virtual machine. Note that 
I haven’t tried this for iDVD, but this ought 
to give you some degree of futureproofing; 
I use Snow Leopard Server in a virtual 
machine for those rare occasions I need 
to use very old apps.
Since OS X Lion, you’ve been able to 
install the regular version of the system in 
a virtual machine. If you don’t own Parallels 
Desktop or VMware Fusion, try running 
iDVD in a virtual machine within VirtualBox 
(virtualbox.org) initially, as that’s free.

Back to Boot Camp
 I upgraded to High Sierra upon its release, 
only then to downgrade back to Sierra. The 
sticking issue for me is the sad situation 
with Boot Camp where I can’t easily switch 
back from Windows to macOS, because the 
option in Boot Camp’s taskbar icon to 
restart in macOS no longer works, no doubt 
because Windows doesn’t work with the 
new file system.
I am happy to upgrade, but only once 
Apple releases a new Boot Camp software 
for Windows. I can’t understand why we are 
still waiting for this to be fixed. I am sure 
many other readers feel my pain. 
B Y  L E E  B R O M L E Y
ALEX SAYS… Apple Support still says the 
way to use Boot Camp with High Sierra is 
to restart your Mac holding down the å 
key and use Startup Manager to choose 
from your Windows and macOS volumes. 
The initial release of High Sierra seems 
to have broken quite a few things, though – 
some of them major security concerns, 
such as the root user issue, the password 
hint problem, and keychain complications. 
Although these issues have all thankfully 
been resolved with updates, it’s anyone’s 
guess how long it will take Apple to get 
around to a fix for the Boot Camp issue.
Mediafour’s MacDrive (bit.ly/mfmdbt) 
software for Windows is available in a 
version that includes APFS support, but 
given it’s a third-party product and still in 
beta testing, we can’t recommend it yet.
However, the existence of that utility 
makes us hopeful Apple will eventually 
offer an improved official solution for 
going between Boot Camp and a macOS 
installation that’s using APFS. We have 
invited Apple to comment on the likelihood 
of this. If we hear anything, we’ll confirm 
on our social media accounts.
it’s geared up to be a platform for 
professional developers to create 
standalone apps for macOS and iOS.
Of course, those rules apply to the 
software in its current form. We’d really like 
to see FileMaker on the store in some form, 
like a FileMaker Standard or Home rather 
than Pro. As someone with only modest 
database needs, I wish the company’s 
consumer-focused Bento was still around.
History starts today
 I have been told that my external drive, 
used solely for Time Machine, needs to be 
reformatted each time a new macOS is 
installed. Is this necessary?
B Y  S T E V E  R A F F I N
JO SAYS… That doesn’t sound right to us, 
no. A key beneﬁ t of Time Machine, for major 
or minor OS updates, is the ability to start up 
in macOS Recovery and see a list of exactly 
which version of macOS was installed at each 
point in time, and then roll back to a much 
older one if an unforeseen issue arises.
If your Mac’s startup disk is an SSD, 
installing High Sierra converts it to the new 
ﬁ le system, APFS. In Time Machine’s current 
version, the backup disk must use the older 
Mac OS Extended (HFS+) system. However, 
Time Machine doesn’t care if the startup disk 
and its backup disk use different ﬁ le systems.
Boot Camp’s ‘Return to macOS’ 
command is currently non-functional 
on Macs that have migrated to APFS.

MATT BOLTON…
APPLE CORE Opinion
 macformat.com  @macformat
18 | MACFORMAT | FEBRUARY 2018
ABOUT MATT BOLTON
 Matt is the editor of Future’s flagship
technology magazine T3 and has been
charting changes at Apple since his
student days. He’s sceptical of tech
industry hyperbole, but still gets warm
and fuzzy on hearing “one more thing”.
IS HOPING TO SEE AN OLD  
FRIEND FINALLY GET BACK  
INTO GOOD HEALTH IN  
APPLE’S 2018 LINE-UP
The really out-there option that won’t 
happen (if only because it makes a mockery of 
Apple’s capitalisation choices) is, inevitably, 
the one I’d love to see most: a Mac mini Pro. 
In a box roughly the size of the current mini, 
you could fit Intel’s mobile Xeon workstation-
class processors, a 1TB super-fast SSD, 
Nvidia’s professional-level Quadra graphics, 
and a whole bank of Thunderbolt 3 ports for 
expanding in pretty much any way you want. 
And if that sounds fanciful, this is by no 
means a pie-in-the-sky idea for a computer – 
HP kind of already made it in the form of the 
Z2 Mini, and I’ve loved the idea ever since.
Any of these ideas could produce an 
amazing little computer, one that’s a million 
miles better than the outcast currently 
squatting at the bottom of the Mac line-up. 
And with the lowest-priced iMac starting at 
over a grand, we need a good entry-level Mac.
Last year proved to be a hardware bonanza for Apple. 
We got a new desktop pro machine in the iMac Pro, 
improvements to the new-look  MacBook Pro, 
and much stronger 4K and 5K iMacs. Even the 
MacBook Air – which keeps limping along like 
the character in an action movie who hasn’t told 
the others they’ve been shot, smiling and wistfully 
saying “Yeah, we’ll all make it to Retina together 
one day, friends”, while stifling a bloody cough – 
got updated with new processors.
Everything except the poor Mac mini. I really hope Apple 
has plans for a huge relaunch of the mini (Tim Cook says it’ll be 
an “important part” of Apple’s product line-up going forward, 
but who know if that just means he likes them as doorstops), 
because it used to be brilliant machine – especially when Apple 
was packing  in quad-core processors, for a totally reasonable 
price. It didn’t have a discrete graphics processor, so it wasn’t 
a miniature powerhouse overall. However, for pretty much 
everything other than gaming (and 
especially for programming), it was 
superb value for money. But then 
Apple dropped the mini’s speed 
and raised its price, and it’s never 
been particularly tempting since. 
However, there’s no reason it can’t 
go back to the glory days. 
One option is for Apple to 
embrace it being low-powered, with processors from the 
12-inch MacB0ok, a little 128GB flash drive for storage, and 
shrunk to maybe the size of an Apple TV. This would take it 
back to being a great inexpensive entry-level Mac – zippy for 
light use, capable of supporting up to a 4K external screen, with 
easy, cheap storage expansion through USB 3 when you need it. 
Alternatively, Apple could go for the modern version 
of when the mini was at its best. Intel recently started making 
low-power, quad-core mobile chips for products like the 13-inch 
MacBook Pro, and these would be great for making 
a Mac mini powerhouse. Keep it a similar 
size, pop in a Fusion Drive and make 
a tidy machine for home photography 
or video work. And it should come 
in Space Grey.
The HP Z2 Mini workstation is a bit larger than the 
Mac mini, but you just know Apple could squeeze 
the same power into a smaller space.
I really hope 
Apple has plans 
for a relaunch 
of the Mac mini
The mini peaked with a quad-core Core i7 
model in 2012. But it hasn’t received any 
updates since going dual-core in 2014.

The first iMac I can remember using was an

to use a G3 or G4 in their heyday!
It was certainly different. But I bet the ‘hockey

I can imagine. The one that really blew me 
away was actually the most recent iMac. The 
thinnest edge was the most beautiful thing I’d 
ever seen on a computer.         It felt impossible 
that Apple had squeezed everything in.
I would love to have had one of those. It was 
so different to the competition.
I got a third-party mouse!          Not much fun

Absolutely. I guess when you have Apple’s 
resources anything is possible! Even with the 
G4, I can remember people asking me where 
the computer itself was.
That’s what Apple’s been really good at when 
it comes to designing computers. So it’s hard 
to pick a particular favourite because each 
iMac I’ve had has stuck in my mind. But for 
its impact at the time, the G3 comes top.
I remember when the G3 first came out. It 
was a lot like the first iPhone in that it blew 
away your ideas of what a computer was.

EDITED BY CLIFF JOSEPH 
mart tech is all about 
making life easier, and one 
of the most labour-intensive 
rooms in any home is the 
kitchen. There’s always something to 
do there, whether it’s cooking, cleaning, 
or unpacking your shopping into the 
fridge. And while we may have washing 
machines and dishwashers to help us out, 
there’s no smart tech currently available 
that can put your socks in pairs or cook 
the perfect soufﬂé while you play 
Pokémon Go on your iPhone.
But we’re ﬁnally starting to see some 
progress in the kitchen. Samsung made 
waves with its super-expensive super-
fridge, but there are more down-to-
earth devices too, such as Tefal’s smart 
frying pan and the iKettle – yes, that is a 
real thing. So here’s our guide to getting 
smart in your Apple Home kitchen.
Cooking and cleaning in the 
kitchen is always a bit of a chore,

APPLE HOME Smart kitchen
What about Siri?
 Many of these smart 
appliances will work 
with Amazon Echo. 
Unfortunately, there’s 
little support for Siri or 
Apple’s HomeKit at the 
moment. Apple has 
released SiriKit – a 
programming tool that 
lets other apps work 
with Siri, but it really is 
Amazon that’s making 
the running right now. 
Let’s hope that the new 
HomePod stirs things up 
a bit and encourages 
more support for Siri.
How much is…?
 One thing Siri can help 
with in the kitchen is 
converting weights and 
measures in recipes. 
Just use the ‘Hey Siri’ 
command to activate 
Siri – so you don’t get 
sticky fingers on your 
device – and you can 
ask questions, such 
as ‘how much is five 
pounds in kilograms?’
ld-fashioned devices such as 
cookers and washing machines 
haven’t changed much over the 
years, and some of these trusty 
old devices have proved to be remarkably 
resistant to new smart technology.
Cookers, in particular, just keep saying ‘no’ 
to the Internet of Things, as we saw a couple of 
years ago when LG’s SmartThinQ cooker came 
and went in the space of about six months. You 
can, however, pick up some smaller cooking aids 
to help you out at dinner time. Tefal’s ActiFry 
Smart XL (£200) is a smart – and healthy – 
frying pan that requires very little oil, and can 
use Bluetooth to communicate with your iPhone. 
The Tefal app includes recipes, and can monitor 
temperature and cooking time so that you can 
take a breather while dinner is sizzling away.
One of our favourite kitchen aids is the Drop 
Scale, which has been available from the Apple 
Store for a couple of years now. Priced at £80, 
the Drop Kitchen Scale uses Bluetooth to 
connect to its iPhone app and, as well as simply 
weighing ingredients, the Drop app includes 
recipes and cooking tips, and can even suggest 
alternatives if you tend to forget at least one 
important ingredient when you’re out shopping.
The idea of an ‘iKettle’ started as a bit of a 
joke a few years back, but the Smarter iKettle 
(£100) actually turned into a real product, and is 
now on version 3.0. It even works with Amazon’s 
Alexa, so you can say “make me a cuppa” when

 Many of these devices 
and appliances work 
with an automation tool 
called IFTTT – ‘if this, 
then that’. This allows 
you to link devices 
together, perhaps 
linking your lights to the 
latest iKettle, so that it 
starts brewing when you 
get up in the morning.

What about 
kitchen safety?
 Fires are always a risk in 
kitchens, so it’s a good 
idea to use some smart 
tech to avoid accidents. 
There are a number of 
smoke alarms available 
that can send alerts to 
your iPhone, with Nest’s 
Protect alarm being the 
most well known (£199). 
We’re also looking forward 
to Netatmo’s Smart Smoke 
Alarm (£TBC), which can 
use HomeKit to turn on 
your lights and help wake 
you up in an emergency.
What about floods?
 Leaking water is another 
big safety risk in the 
kitchen. Several companies 
make water sensors for 
about £30 that can detect 
leaks and floods – but 
watch out when buying, as 
many of these sensors will 
only work as part of a 
larger home-automation 
system, such as Samsung’s 
SmartThings kit (£199).
With the Nest Protect, peace of 
mind is just a quick tap away.
it’s time for tea (though you still have to ﬁll it 
up and pour the tea yourself). Smarter makes 
a coffee machine too, for £180, which beneﬁts 
more from the high-tech approach as the 
Smarter app can store personalised settings 
for your family and friends, with details of what 
type of coffee they like, as well as different 
strengths and brewing times. 
A job for super-fridge!
One area that’s seen interesting developments 
recently is the humble fridge. Samsung really 
made the headlines last year with its gloriously 
over-the-top Wi-Fi-connected ‘super-fridge’ – 
also known as the Family Hub. The original 
two-door Family Hub cost a whopping £4,500 
when it ﬁrst arrived in the UK last year, 
although that has come down to a still hefty 
£2,900 now. Samsung has also released a 
smaller, single-door fridge-freezer model 
costing about £2,000. 
Both models include Wi-Fi connectivity, 
with an LCD screen on the front of the unit 
that lets you browse the web, write down 
notes or calendar events, or play music while 
you’re cooking up a storm. The Family Hub 
also includes a number of cameras inside the 
refrigerator so that you can quickly check on 
your iPhone to see whether you need to pick 
up anything on the way home. 
But you don’t have to spend thousands to 
get a smart fridge. Smarter crops up again 
here, with its FridgeCam (£99). This sits inside 
your fridge so you can view its contents on 
your iPhone. Its app can also scan barcodes 
to check expiry dates and warn you when 
your mouldy cheese is about to evolve into 
a sentient being. We also like the look of the 
GeniCan ($149), a smart sensor that attaches 
to your kitchen bin and scans the barcode on 
items as you throw them away 
and then automatically creates 
a shopping list. Sadly, its 
maker warns that its product 
database consists of US products, so items 
that aren’t sold there may not be recognised – 
though you can add others manually.
All washed up
Washing machines, even the non-smart type, 
have been one of the great labour-saving 
devices of the last century, and while you still 
have to load them up and do the ironing, there 
are now several smart washers that provide 
remote control from your iPhone. This means 
you can load up in the morning and then turn 
the washing machine on just before you get 
home in the evening, or perhaps schedule the 
wash for times when energy rates are lower.
Whirlpool is the main company in this ﬁeld, 
with its 6th Sense range of washers and driers, 
and its FCSR 12441 washer has received some 
great reviews. It’s pricey (around 
£800 to £1,000), but that’s not too 
expensive for a top-of-the-range 
washing machine, and the Whirlpool 
app lets you control the machine when 
you’re out, as well as selecting the 
right program for different items. 
Samsung has been getting in 
on the act as well, although models 
such as its touchscreen WW900 weigh in at 
over £1,200. And LG is working on its 
SmartThinq Hub, expected to be around £120. 
This little speaker is essentially a variation on 
the Amazon Echo voice assistant, but it can 
also be paired with a series of small sensors 
that you can attach to devices such as 
a washing machine or cooker. 
Your existing washing machine 
can then become ‘semi-
smart’, telling you when it’s 
ﬁnished, while your fridge 
can check barcodes for 
expiration dates. 
You can add a product like 
Smarter’s FridgeCam to your 
kitchen, rather than spend 
thousands on a smart fridge
Whirlpool’s 6th Sense app allows you to operate your 
appliances from your phone, so you can wash and go!
This Smarter FridgeCam scans 
barcodes so that its app can let you 
know if food is nearing its expiry date.

How one machine continues to change  
the way we think about computers
iMac
The 20th anniversary 
T
he iMac has been around for 20 years. 
Just let that sink in for a moment. Since its 
debut in August 1998, Apple has launched 
59 separate laptop models, 15 iPads and 18 
iPhones. In fact, the iMac was already almost 10 years 
old when the original iPhone was launched. The 
product that saved Apple has seen a lot in its time.
This is the story of one of Apple’s most important 
products, a computer that not only brought Apple back 
from the brink of destruction, but propelled it to the 
cutting edge of cool, and coffers full of cash. We’ll trace 
its journey, from its fascinating beginnings to its world-
beating status quo. It’s a tale of inspiration and failures, 
fame and vitriol, jelly beans and sunﬂowers. It forged 
lifelong partnerships, took on giants and prompted

hen Steve Jobs returned to Apple 
in 1997, the company was in a very 
bad way. A far cry from its anti- 
establishment origins in the 1970s, 
it was churning out a confusing array of boring 
beige boxes that looked no different from the PC 
competition. Worse, it was losing money hand over ﬁst, 
with most analysts predicting its impending doom. The 
June 1997 issue of Wired magazine nicely summed up 
the mood, with a cover featuring the Apple logo wearing 
a crown of thorns. Below it ran a single word: Pray.
Steve Jobs knew he had a gargantuan task ahead 
of him when he returned to Apple, and he wasted 
no time slashing extraneous projects and products. 
From now on, he declared, Apple would have just 
four product categories, and no more: consumer 
and professional desktops and notebooks.
The iMac G3 was to be Apple’s consumer desktop 
offering. Soon after returning, Jobs strode into Jony Ive’s 
design lab to see what kind of work he was capable of. 
It wasn’t the start you might expect. Said Jobs to Ive with 
his trademark bluntness: “you’ve not been very effective, 
have you?” For his part, Ive had his resignation letter in 
his pocket. Yet Ive insists that he and Jobs clicked right 
away, saying that they were both “a little bit odd”.
That mutual understanding manifested itself in the 
iMac’s design. As Ive put it, “We could make a computer 
look like a grapefruit” because the then-current form of 
computers – plain beige boxes – had nothing to do with 
their function. Other computer ﬁrms were afraid to 
stray from that staid design, but not Apple. The task 
was to design a computer that could still be recognised 
as such, without scaring people away or boring them.
To do that, the original iMac had to be two things: 
approachable and elegantly simple. In 1998, people 
were still very much afraid of computers. They were 
distant, unknowable machines somewhat akin to the 
Enigma, with only the nerdiest and most devoted of 
acolytes able to operate them. At least, that was the 
perception. But by adding colour to the iMac, Apple 
brought it personality. By making it translucent, 
Apple took away the mystery of its internals.
An insanely great computer
Key to this approachability was the handle. 
Ive and Jobs knew that this was not a computer 
that many people were going to pick up and 
carry on a regular basis. But the handle was 
symbolic, too: it was an invitation to touch 
the machine, to make contact with it. And 
it said that this is a computer that the user 
can hold and manipulate, even if they 
are totally new to computing.
Being elegantly simple reinforced the 
approachability of the machine. Instead 
of coming with reams of trailing wires 
“The back of our 
computer looks 
better than the front 
of their computers”
Steve Jobs
The iMac’s original name
Thank goodness for Ken Segall. The creative director 
of Apple’s ad agency came up with the name 
‘iMac’, but Apple had other ideas. Steve Jobs 
hated the name at first, and insisted on calling 
the computer a ‘MacMan’. Luckily, Segall 
was able to convince him that 
was a bad idea.

and requiring hours (and possibly a technician) 
to set up, the iMac was a simple all-in-one 
computer. It was advertised as being able to get 
you set up and on the internet in a mere two steps. 
First it disarmed you, then it empowered you.
Still, it wasn’t without controversy. While some 
people bemoaned the absent SCSI ports, it was the lack 
of a ﬂoppy drive that really riled up the crowd. In 1998, 
the ﬂoppy was still a staple of many homes and ofﬁces, 
and conspiracy theories abounded claiming Apple had 
omitted the drives in order to make more money selling 
them separately. The truth, however, was much simpler: 
the ﬂoppy drive was dying. Games and apps were being 
distributed on CDs, Steve Jobs reasoned. And besides, 
people would send ﬁles over the internet in the future, 
Apple said; what better way to take a step into that 
future than with an iMac?
A winning partnership
The iMac G3 was very much Steve Jobs’ 
baby. Like a proud father, he helped 
guide its development and helped 
overcome its problems. But 
because it was based on his 
perception of what a computer 
should be, there was a lot riding 
on it. Ken Segall, the creative 
director of Apple’s advertising 
agency and the originator of the 
‘Think Different’ campaign, was 
wowed by the iMac, but also a tad 
worried. “I’d like to believe we 
were all so smart that within 
seconds we were convinced 
that we were witnessing the 
start of a miracle resurgence,” he 
later said, “but it wasn’t quite like 
that.” His own feeling, and that of his 
fellow agency members, was “part shock, 
part excitement, and part hope that Steve Jobs 
really knew what he was doing – because there was 
a real chance that this revolutionary computer might 
just be too shocking for its own good.” The iMac didn’t 
just have to save Apple. It had to save Steve Jobs, too.
The shock soon wore off for Segall, to be replaced 
with excitement. The iMac G3 was the future, he 
realised. At his next meeting with Jobs, the 
Apple co-founder was feeling ebullient. 
“The back of our computer looks 
better than the front of their 
computers,” he said, dismissive 
as ever of his rivals. “Once the 
shock of our ﬁrst sighting had 
worn off, we understood how 
revolutionary [the iMac G3] 
was going to be,” says Segall. 
“We were believers. We couldn’t 
wait to start developing a 
campaign for it.”
The peripherals
The mouse
One of Apple’s most 
infamous missteps, the 
round Apple USB Mouse 
was hard to orient and 
disliked by users. Jony 
Ive was a fan, though 
(see iMac Fact above).
The keyboard
The Apple USB Keyboard 
was a more compact 
affair than many of 
Apple’s previous efforts, 
with some keys reduced 
in size or eliminated. It 
featured a power button.
The floppy drive
The lack of a floppy drive 
was controversial at the 
time, and third-party 
manufacturers stepped 
in to fill the breach. But 
it wasn’t long until the 
floppy became a relic.
The design failure that wasn’t
Despite the negative reaction to the Apple USB 
Mouse, Jony Ive insisted that it wasn’t a failure. 
“Everything we make I could describe as being 
partially wrong, because it’s not perfect,” 
he said, adding that it presented a great 
opportunity to design something 
better next time.

Jobs was involved in almost every stage of the iMac’s 
design, which Ive described as a “vigorous intellectual 
process”. The Apple CEO insisted that the iMac had to 
be an all-in-one, a throwback to Apple’s heritage with 
the original Macintosh. It had to build on that heritage 
while also bringing it up to date. By the end of his ﬁrst 
meeting with Jony Ive, the two were already sketching 
iMac design ideas together. “One thing most people 
don’t know is that Steve Jobs is an exceptional designer,” 
says Ive. High praise indeed.
While Ive and his top deputy Danny Coster were 
tasked with coming up with iMac designs, Jobs made 
reﬁnements and approved – or rejected – models. Jobs 
disliked Ive’s ﬁrst dozen designs, but Ive pressed on 
with one, insisting it had promise. He told Jobs that 
its curves and creative look meant “It has a sense that 
it’s just arrived on your desktop or it’s just about to 
hop off and go somewhere.”
After some slight adjustments, Jobs had changed 
his tack, declaring that he loved it. He carried the model 
with him around the ofﬁce, 
showing it off to trusted executives 
and colleagues. It was the embodiment of 
Apple’s philosophy – it thought different, 
it was fun, it was rebellious. Even the internals 
were subject to Apple design principles, since you 
could see them through the iMac’s shell. The revelation 
of the machine’s guts took away their mystery, and also 
illustrated the effort that designing them had entailed. 
There were no secrets with this machine, no hidden, 
unfathomable moving parts. Like Prometheus bringing 
the knowledge of ﬁre to the ﬁrst humans, the iMac was 
designed to make computing understandable and, 
ultimately, conquerable.
More than skip deep
Achieving the right effect for the case was not easy, and 
Jobs and Ive visited a jelly bean factory to learn how to 
make translucent colours look attractive. The cost of 
each case was $60, three times as much as a regular 
“One thing most people 
don’t know is that Steve Jobs 
is an exceptional designer”

The reason the iMac doesn’t have a fan is engineering. 
It took a ton of engineering and that’s true for the 
Cube and everything else.”
He explained further: “The thing that all of our 
competitors are missing is that they think it’s about 
fashion, they think it’s about surface appearance. 
And they couldn’t be further from the truth. The iMac 
isn’t about candy-coloured computers. The iMac is 
about making a computer that is really quiet, that 
doesn’t need a fan, that wakes up in 15 seconds, that 
has the best sound system in a consumer computer, 
a superﬁne display. It’s about a complete computer that 
expresses it on the outside as well. And [competitors] 
just see the outside. They say ‘We’ll slap some colour 
on this piece of junk computer, and we’ll have one, too.’ 
And they miss the point.”
Missing the point or not, it wasn’t long before 
the world was ﬂooded with translucent plastic. From 
computers to George Foreman grills, the look that 
shook up the world of tech suddenly looked very 
dated indeed. Apple knew that it was time for change –  
it was time for the iMac G4.
PC case, but Jobs had no qualms about that – he knew 
it was vital to the iMac’s identity.
It worked. The iMac was a huge success, propelling 
Apple not only back into relevancy, but proﬁtability too.
That line of thinking – the deep understanding of 
what was required, regardless of the cost to Apple – 
separated the iMac from its imitators (and there were 
plenty of those). Here’s how Steve Jobs put it: “When 
people look at an iMac, they think the design is really 
great, but most people don’t understand it’s not skin 
deep. There’s a reason why, after two years, people 
haven’t been able to copy the iMac. It’s not just surface. 
“The thing our competitors  
are missing is that they 
think it’s all about fashion”

A helping hand from LG
As well as visiting a jelly bean factory, Apple 
executives Ive and Dan Riccio spent eight weeks 
at LG (the iMac’s manufacturer) working out 
how to implement a planned revision. These

done in-house at Apple rather than

The iMac G4 was a radical 
departure from the G3, 
making use of a flat-panel 
display for the first time.
FEATURE A celebration of the iMac 

If you’re Apple, how do you top the incredible iMac G3? 
The answer is with the gorgeous G4 and its quirky design
H
ow exactly to follow the revolutionary 
success of the iMac G3 was something 
of a problem for Apple. After all, the G3 
was the device that saved Apple. The G4 
had to be something even more special. Apple was 
stabilising; its next computer had to make it successful. 
Expectations across the industry were high.
Ive and Jobs were keenly aware of this. After all, 
they’d experienced it before – as soon as the original 
iMac was announced, the press was already ramping 
up the pressure on the forthcoming iBook, Apple’s 
consumer laptop that followed the G3. “It’s a bit 
scary,” said Ive at the time.
At the turn of the 21st century, flat-panel display 
technology was finally becoming affordable, allowing 
for new ways of building a computer. Designers could 
now dream up new creations that weren’t possible 
before. Of course, that was easier said than done.
The original plan for the iMac G4 was much like 
today’s iMac. All of the computer’s components were 
to be mounted onto the back of a flat-panel display in 
a sleek, all-in-one configuration. But the designers 
struggled with the limitations of the technology of 
the time. They found, for example, that the CD drive 
performed poorly when mounted vertically, as it had 
to be if it was to sit on the back of the display.
Jobs wasn’t happy. Each component had to be true 
to itself, he insisted, which was impossible if they were 
forced into unfamiliar arrangements simply in order 
to fit on the back of a screen.
After yet another day of frustration, he invited Ive 
back to his house to discuss their progress – or lack 
thereof. They took a stroll in the garden, abundant 
with golden sunflowers. Suddenly, Ive had an idea. 
What if the display was separated from the base of 
the computer? What if it was on a neck that allowed 
it to swivel and move, much like a sunflower? He 
began to sketch excitedly. This new design allowed 
Apple to assign meaning to the iMac. It was now so 
fluid, so flexible, that it could reach for the sun. Just 
as the G3 was designed to suggest that it had just 
arrived on your desk and could hop off at any minute, 
the G4 was also made to feel alive and a part of nature.
Of course, sketching such a computer and actually 
Jobs wasn’t happy. Each  
component had to be true  
to itself, he insisted

The G4’s base was a marvel of hardware engineering, fitting 
every component into a small and shapely white dome.
A celebration of the iMac FEATURE 

making it work were two very different things. The 
G4 has often been compared to Luxo Jr, the animated 
Pixar light, or an anglepoise lamp, but Ive insisted 
that the neck of the G4 was stronger than that of the 
famous desk light, so that it wouldn’t sway or droop. 
This involved simulating years of testing in order to 
guarantee its strength. It also had to be sturdy enough 
to withstand someone lifting the whole computer by 
the neck, however inadvisable.
Then there was the base, which housed the Mac’s 
components. Apple managed to cram everything into 
a white dome a mere 10.6-inches in diameter, a pretty 
exceptional feat. Everything had to fit perfectly, all 
while operating almost silently, something achieved 
through a clever fan system that drew air in from the 
bottom of the unit. And, of course, it was heavy 
enough to anchor the iMac securely, without the 
risk of it tipping over.
No stone left unturned
The attention to detail was quite remarkable. 
The combination of a faster processor and smaller 
enclosure than the G3 meant that the iMac G4 needed 
a fan, but Apple’s designers ensured it was no louder 
than the sound of a hard drive spinning up. It wasn’t 
enough for the computer 
to work well – it had to 
sound good, too.
Another example can 
be found in an unlikely 
place – the machine’s 
screws. Jony Ive insisted 
that they should have a 
special finish and shape, 
but Jon Rubinstein, the 
hardware engineering 
chief at Apple, vetoed 
them over concerns they 
would lead to delays. Ive 
went directly to Steve 
Jobs – and got his way. 
They were put to good 
use on the hatch used 
to access the iMac G4’s memory; the initial plan was 
to use a pop-open hatch, but it was thought that this 
might be too difficult to use. Not many companies 
would put so much effort into components so small.
Following the iMac G3 was never going to be easy, 
but Apple has rarely opted for the easy route. The G4 
came at a time of consolidation for Apple, when there 
was tremendous pressure on it to produce another 
breakout product. Despite some initial scepticism, 
it has gone on to be seen as a classic example of Apple 
design, an embodiment of the belief that design could 
be both simple and beautiful. There’s even a G4 in the 
Museum of Modern Art in New York.

hile the idea of mounting a 
computer’s components behind 
its display was ahead of its time 
in 2001, by 2004 it was much more 
feasible. Other PC companies had tried it, but none 
had been successful. Now it was Apple’s turn to shake 
up the industry again.
The G5 took the sleek white design trappings of the 
G4 and the iPod and took them further. Where the G4’s 
neck was glossy and reﬂective, the G5’s stand was matte, 
creating a more understated, less showy visual style. 
Indeed, from the side it had a striking resemblance 
to a large iPod mounted upon a metal stand.
There were further iPod connections. The slogan 
Apple used to promote the G5 was “From the creators 
of the iPod”, clearly meant to lure in ﬁrst-time buyers 
whose ﬁrst taste of the Apple ecosystem had been with 
its portable music players, not its computers.
Upon release, the iMac G5 could be detached from 
its included stand and mounted on a VESA arm instead. 
Users could also remove the back of the G5 completely, 
in order to upgrade the memory. However, both of 
these possibilities were removed in later revisions, 
bringing the G5 closer to the hermetically sealed 
stylings of the iPod than the more user-serviceable 
form factor traditional to PCs. You could still install 
more memory, but not a lot else.
The G4’s neck was specially 
constructed to stay in position, 
without slumping.

eMac 
The introduction of iMacs with flat- 
screen displays presented a problem: 
they were still expensive. To give 
schools an affordable option, Apple 
released the eMac in 2002. Visually, 
it was very similar to the iMac G3, 
save for an all-white enclosure and 
a large 17-inch screen. Inside, was a 
PowerPC G4 processor, giving it plenty 
of power. The eMac lasted until 2006, 
when it was discontinued.
FEBRUARY 2018 | MACFORMAT | 37
Everything about 
the G5 screamed minimalism. 
The power button and USB ports were on the 
back. The speakers were on the bottom, designed 
to bounce sound up off your desk. The front of the 
computer was almost completely bare, save for an 
Apple logo positioned neatly in the middle.
Its design heritage lay in an earlier, doomed Apple 
computer – the Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh 
(TAM). Launched in March 1997, it was an all-in-one 
designed to showcase the best tech of the day. That gave 
it a premium price tag of $7,499 and it was discontinued 
a mere one year later. The G5 was an attempt to bring 
much of the TAM philosophy – sleek, self-contained 
power – to the consumer market.
The G5’s design – with revisions – has been a staple 
of the iMac for close to 15 years now. We’ll see what’s 
changed since 2004 overleaf.
The never-ending quest for thin
While it seems chunky nowadays, the iMac G5 was 
impressively slim for its time. Its two-inch depth 
made it “the world’s thinnest desktop computer”, 
Apple bragged. “With the entire system… just 
two inches thin, a lot of people will be 
wondering ‘where did the computer 
go?’” mused Phil Schiller.

F
or years, Apple had packed its iMacs 
with PowerPC processors, developed 
with IBM and Motorola. First debuting in 
the Power Macintosh and Performa models 
of 1994, the PowerPC chip was a mainstay of Apple 
desktop computers for 12 years before being phased out.
Apple had long been railing against what it called 
the ‘megahertz myth’ that it said led to inaccurate 
assessments of its computers. While PowerPC chips 
often came with slower clock speeds than their rivals, 
they just as often matched or outperformed them, 
since calculating a processor’s power is about far 
more than just its megahertz count.
However, Apple was clearly thinking about 
moving beyond PowerPC. Indeed, Apple’s press 
release announcing the Intel-based iMac seemed to 
admit that PowerPC chips weren’t up to scratch. 
It promoted the 2006 iMac as being ‘twice as fast’ 
as its predecessor, despite having an almost identical 
clock speed, suggesting that the older PowerPC chips 
were not as capable as their Intel equivalents.
Packing more punch
Shifting to Intel meant more than just updating 
hardware – software made by both Apple and third- 
party developers would have to be rewritten to work 
with the new chips. To counteract this, Apple wrote 
a piece of software called Rosetta to automatically 
translate apps built for PowerPC onto Intel’s platform.
Despite all of the upheaval over the internals of 
Intel-based iMacs, by outward appearances they were 
identical to the G5 that preceded them. Perhaps this 
was Apple’s way of reducing consumer concern over 
the new chips – ‘business as usual’ was the message.

Well ahead of deadline
By the early 2000s, Steve Jobs was growing 
disappointed with PowerPC chips. He announced at 
WWDC 2005 that Apple would begin transitioning 
to Intel processors by June 2006, and would 
finish by late 2007. It actually went a lot 
faster, with the first Intel Macs 
out in January 2006.
iMac
FACTS
Just over a year and a half later, in August 
2007, came that missing case redesign. The 
most obvious change was in the materials 
used. No longer did the iMac look like an 
iPod on steroids; now it was clad in sleek 
aluminium with a plastic back. The 
display sizes also got a boost, up from 
17 and 20 inches to 20 and 24 inches.
Apple’s obsession over simplicity 
came to the fore in the aluminium 
iMac, which only had one visible 
screw on the entire enclosure, 
used to secure the panel that 
covered the memory slots.
As beautiful as the iMac 
was, Apple knew it could 
do better. In October 2009 
it overhauled the body, 
unveiling a full unibody design 
made from a single piece of aluminium.
Display sizes were again increased, this time 
up to 21.5 inches and 27 inches. Interestingly, the 
aspect ratio was changed from 16:10 to 16:9, 
a move Apple touted as making the iMac 
ideal for viewing movies and photos.
The unibody iMac was also the first 
to ship with Apple’s Magic Mouse, its first 
mouse with the Multi-Touch technology 
that had already been featured in the 
iPhone and the MacBook’s trackpad.
The most recent revision (in terms 
of case design) came in 2012. Even by 
Apple’s standards, the new slimline 
iMac was a design marvel, measuring 
just 5mm at its thinnest point.
Apple left display sizes the same, 
but added USB 3.0 ports for the 
first time. On 21.5-inch models, 
the memory was soldered in place 
and couldn’t be changed without 
taking the iMac apart (although 
the 27-inch models retained a 
panel to access the memory).
The iMac Pro features the 
same exterior look, albeit in a 
space grey shade. Nearly six 
years after its last redesign, 
the iMac is surely due an 
update; what will Apple 
unleash on the world next?

Layout options 
In Photoshop, choose File > Automate > Photomerge. 
Set the source to be a folder, then point Photoshop at your 
panorama’s images. You’ll almost always get good results from 
setting the layout option to Auto. Otherwise, try Perspective.

Consistency is key
You need to take care when you shoot for your panorama. 
Use manual mode to make sure each exposure is exactly the 
same, and make sure the zoom and focus of your lens doesn’t 
change between shots. Put the files on their own in a folder.

 How to align layers in

how its Photomerge 
feature works.
YOU’LL NEED
 A recent version of 
Photoshop, and a set 
of pictures ready to 
be stitched together
If there’s one trick we never 
get tired of playing with on 
iPhone, it’s the camera’s ability 
to automatically stitch together 
a panorama simply by sweeping your phone 
across a majestic view. The results are pretty 
good, too, but you can’t get away from the fact 
that your DSLR, while more complicated to 
use, generally shoots better-looking, less noisy 
images. You’ve also got a wider choice of lenses 
and the ability to shoot in much worse light – 
the only question is how to merge your images 
together seamlessly.
Photoshop has made huge improvements 
to this over the years, from the ability of early 
versions to simply stack images together and 
leaving you to sort it out, to modern versions, 
which attempt to detect where one image 
ends and another begins, lining them up and 
blending them together. Here’s how to use its 
Photomerge feature. Dave Stevenson

Stitching panoramas APPLE SKILLS
Genius tip!
 When you shoot pics 
for your panorama, 
make sure they overlap 
by quite a bit. A little 
less than half of the 
ﬁrst image should be 
present in the second, 
and so on.
Jargon buster
 A mask is an invisible 
layer that sits over 
an image. Areas ﬁlled 
with black become 
transparent, allowing 
you to see the layers 
below. White means 
opaque, and greys are 
for varied opacities.

Stitch and mask
After a bit of thought, Photoshop will produce a stitched-
together image, with each of your original shots placed on a new 
masked layer to allow the one beneath to show. These masks will 
be irregular in order to create the most seamless join.
3
Sort vignettes and distortion 
If you know your lens suffers from dark corners, turn on 
Vignette Removal. Similarly, if your lens doesn’t produce 
geometrically neutral images – in other words, if you get barrel 
distortion – turn on Geometric Distortion Correction.

Masks
 Layer masks are 
where the magic 
happens – the 
images’ edges are 
intelligently cut to 
create seamless 
transitions.

Fill and check 
Click OK and Photoshop performs another of its tricks; 
sampling from nearby detail to fill in the plain areas of your 
selection. Don’t be laissez-faire, though – check the filled-in 
areas and be particularly aware of signs of repeating patterns.
8
Lasso transparent areas
For more detailed areas. Press L to select the Lasso 
tool, then drag around an area of transparency. This doesn’t 
need to be a tidy selection; just try not to include too much 
of your image in the area you demarcate.
6
Sort rough edges
If your image is seamless – Photoshop does an uncannily 
good job at achieving this – it’s time to fill out the panorama’s 
edges. If you picked Content Aware Fill Transparent Areas in 
step 3 you won’t have rough edges, but our example here does.
9
Sort the colour
Press ß+% to open the Fill dialog. In this window there’s a 
pop-up menu for choosing the foreground or background colour, 
plus other options; for now choose Content-Aware. Leave Colour 
Adaptation selected and set the mode to Normal.
7
Clone Stamp sample 
Choose Layer > Flatten Image. For plain areas such as sky, 
use the Clone Stamp tool (S): hold å and click to choose a place 
to sample from, then drag across the empty target area. The 
sample point you chose will be used to paint over the target.
5
Check the join 
To see the magic at work, zoom into your image and turn 
off the topmost layer. Now turn the layer back on and see if you 
can spot the join. If it’s flawless, you can move onto the next 
layer down and repeat the checking process.

Speed up iCloud & updates
Discover how to reduce internet usage with High Sierra’s content caching
IT WILL TAKE
  5 minutes
YOU WILL LEARN
  How to work with 
content caching
 
YOU’LL NEED
  At least one Mac 
running macOS High 
Sierra, preferably with 
an Ethernet connection 
Content caching is, to 
quote Apple, ‘a macOS 
service that helps reduce 
bandwidth and speed up 
software installation’ across all your 
core Apple devices: Macs, iOS and Apple TV.
Content is stored – or cached – on one of 
your Macs, and other devices can pull that 
content quickly from the local network instead 
of downloading a fresh copy from the internet. 
By default, all system updates and App and 
iBooks Store content are cached, plus there’s 
an option to include your iCloud content too.
Content caching works best on a Mac that’s 
connected to your network via Ethernet rather 
than Wi-Fi. That Mac needs to be switched on 
and connected to the internet for the feature 
to work; when it isn’t, your devices will pull the 
data they need from the internet. The step- 
by-step guide below reveals the basics to 
enabling, configuring and disabling the feature.
Beyond the basics
When you embark on setting up the cache, 
you’ll notice there’s a ‘Share Internet 
connection’ option – this basically extends 
the cache (and your Mac’s internet connection) 
to any iOS device that’s hooked up to the 
Mac using a USB cable. If your household has 
lots of Apple devices, and you find one Mac’s 
bandwidth is getting saturated, you can enable 
content caching on other Macs too. Devices 
then intelligently choose which Mac to use 
to spread the load more evenly. 
Go to Ö > System Preferences > Sharing > 
Content Caching and hold the å key: you’ll 
see the Options button change to Advanced 
Options. Click this and you’ll see three 
additional tabs: Clients, Peers and Parents. 
These allow you to fine-tune your multi-Mac 
caching setup further. For most people the 
default settings are fine, but if you’re in a 
large network, visit bit.ly/contentcaching 
for a guide to optimising these advanced 
settings according to your needs.
Though content caching is new to the 
Sharing pane in macOS High Sierra, the 
feature has been built in to macOS Server  
(bit.ly/mfmacserv) for a while. Consequently, 
even fairly old devices that can’t be upgraded 
to High Sierra or iOS 11 will benefit from it, as 
long as they’re running at least iOS 7 or OS X 
10.8.2 or later – they’ll automatically detect 
the cache on your network. Nick Peers
HOW TO Set up content caching > 
1
Create content cache
In System Preferences, click the 
Sharing icon. Select Content Caching in 
the list on the left, and tick it to turn it on. 
Ensure ‘Cache iCloud content’ is ticked if 
you want the Mac to store that as well as 
media downloads and software updates.
2
Set location and size
Click the Options button if you 
want to store the cache on a different 
drive than where macOS is installed. 
By default, the cache size is unlimited; 
if space is an issue, use the slider to 
reduce it to a manageable level.
3
Clear the cache
Should you ever want to clear the 
cache, click Options and look for a Reset 
button – if it’s available, click it, then click 
Reset in the confirmation sheet to delete 
everything and start afresh. To stop 
caching, just untick ‘Content Caching’.

Pah. Use this app to speed 
up your sums
IT WILL TAKE

YOU WILL LEARN
  The ins and outs of 
Soulver, including 
variables, tokens 
and formatting
YOU’LL NEED
  Soulver and 
a Mac running 
OS X 10.10 or later
Soulver is a mash-up of 
spreadsheet, calculator and 
notepad. That might seem 
odd, until you realise calculator 
apps omit context from calculations, and 
spreadsheets are often overkill for a task. 
Also, both those things lack the immediacy 
you get from jotting down notes, and the 
humanity of writing in plain English.
By contrast, Soulver is akin to scribbling 
sums on the back of an envelope – except all 
your figures are magically totted up for you. 
Documents can include headings and labels, 
and Soulver even recognises word operators 
like ‘per’, ‘at’ and ‘by’ when you don’t fancy 
using mathematical symbols.
It’s a versatile app when you need a 
friendly way to deal with figures. This tutorial 
leads you through the process of creating a 
document for tracking expenses from a work 
trip in the US, but there are many other 
situations where Soulver proves very useful.
You can get a free trial of Soulver from 
acqualia.com. If you like it, the app costs £11.99 
from the Mac App Store, or $11.95 (about £9) 
direct from its developer. Craig Grannell

Quick calculations APPLE SKILLS
FEBRUARY 2018 | MACFORMAT | 49
1
Create some variables
We’ll start by defining a couple of 
variables. These use the construction 
[variable] = [number]. This can be 
as simple as a = 1. For our expenses 
example, enter two lines: Hotel = $199 
and Breakfast = $19.
2
Add a heading
Soulver uses shorthand to format 
lines in specific ways. To mark up a 
heading, type an @ symbol at the start 
of the line. Everything to the right of 
that will be formatted in bold and not 
evaluated. On line 4, type @ January. 
3
Use your variables
Now we’ll use the variables to add 
information for a three-night stay. Across 
the next two lines, type 3\*hotel and 
3\*breakfast. Soulver automatically 
converts \* to a multiplication sign. Also, 
note that variables aren’t case sensitive.
4
Type out a label
Another way of formatting text 
in Soulver is to use a label, which sets 
anything to the left of a colon in bold, 
and only evaluates anything to the right 
of it. Use this to add a line totalling costs 
for taxi journeys.
5
Work with tokens 
Notice that Soulver tots up line 
values in the answers column. You can 
add these to your ongoing sum as answer 
tokens, which update dynamically. Type 
Jan total: then double-click each of the 
three answers under January’s heading.
6
Copy, paste, edit
Copy and paste January’s section 
of the document and change the copy’s 
heading to February. Under this, alter 
the number of days of hotel stays and 
breakfasts – note that the tokens in the 
line for its total automatically update.
7
Create a grand total
Soulver’s automated total bar 
(View > Show Statistics) is fine for basic 
documents, but this one includes 
subtotals. You need to manually create 
a grand total using tokens from the two 
lines for monthly totals, like in step 5.
8
Currency conversion
Soulver’s great for swift currency 
conversion. On a new line, add the grand 
total as a token and type in GBP after it. 
To see how flexible Soulver is, update the 
Hotel variable’s value to $249 and watch 
that affect calculations throughout.
9
Export your calculation
Saved Soulver documents remain 
editable, but to send your output to 
someone who doesn’t have the app, go 
to File > Export. Choose which elements 
to include in your PDF, HTML document 
or email, click Next, and then save/send.

IT WILL TAKE
  15 minutes
YOU WILL LEARN
  How to edit Master 
Slides, group slides, 
and skip slides
YOU’LL NEED
  macOS 10.12 or later, 
Keynote 7.3.1 or later 
(features should work 
on earlier versions)
We all know the Keynote is great 
for making slick presentations 
thanks to easy features such as 
Magic Move for animating slides, 
or simple options for adding new shapes and 
tweaking the style of your slides.
But Keynote’s clever features go way 
beyond jazzing things up. It’s got some handy 
tools for making it simpler to build slideshows 
that are consistent and professional, and for 
helping you keep complex presentations easy 
to follow when you’re editing.
In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to 
tweak the Master Slides of a presentation – 
the building blocks every template is built 
from – so that when you add a new slide, 
it’s already styled in the way you want. 
We’ll also look at how to group slides 
together, so that you can easily find relevant 
sections of your presentation when you need 
to edit them. Plus, a handy way to stop certain 
slides being shown in your presentation, so 
you don’t have to create a whole new project 
for a different audience. Matt Bolton
 HOW TO Organise your slideshows 
1
Start a new project
Start a new project in Keynote (or open 
an existing one you want to edit). Choose a 
template to start with – if you want to create 
your own style, choose the basic Black or 
White options, since they’re easiest to alter.
2
View Master Slides
Choose View > Edit Master Slides. Doing 
this changes the left pane’s contents to show 
the different basic slide types for your chosen 
template. These are editable – just click one 
to select it, then tweak its layout.
Genius tip!
 You can select multiple 
slides just like anything 
else in macOS: hold ç 
and then click to select 
individually, or hold  
ß to select a series.

≈-click on any of the Master Slides and 
choose New Master Slide to create a duplicate 
of the one that’s selected, which you can then 
customise as much as you like. ≈-click it and 
choose Rename to give it a more useful title.
4
Reorganise Master Slides
To get rid of a Master Slide, ≈-click it 
and choose Delete. You can reorder the Master 
Slides by dragging them up and down in the 
list. To finish editing Master Slides, click Done 
in the blue bar beneath the main editing pane.
5
Group slides together
When you build a complex presentation, 
it’s useful to organise your slides into groups. 
You can collapse groups of slides down in the 
sidebar to make it easier to navigate, too. 
You even make groups within groups.
6
Create a group
First, hold ç and click each slide you 
want to add to the group, then drag any one 
of them slightly to the right. When you see a 
blue line to its left, let go. Those slides are now 
grouped under the slide above the blue line.
7
Tweak a group
You can drag slides left to ungroup them, 
or right again to create a subgroup. You can 
change which slide they’re grouped under by 
dragging them up or down through the list of 
slides – the blue line shows where they’ll sit.
8
Skip slides
Got some slides that aren’t relevant to 
your audience? Don’t delete them! ≈-click 
them and choose Skip Slide. When you run the 
presentation, they won’t appear. To reverse 
this, ≈-click them and select Don’t Skip Slide.
Genius tip!
 If you want to 
distribute your slides 
for printing, adding slide 
numbers is a good way 
to make sure people 
don’t get lost. Add 
them to all slides by 
choosing Slide > Show 
Slide Numbers on All 
Slides. Or, add them 
to individual slides in 
the Format pane on the 
right: click the checkbox 
labelled Slide Number.
Jargon buster
 In Keynote, a Master 
Slide is a predesigned 
slide from a template. 
Master Slides make it 
easy to quickly build a 
presentation that looks 
consistent and slick.

Recover lost work
Discover the power of Time Machine and Versions to recover your files
Your Mac comes with a 
built-in backup system 
called Time Machine that’s 
very easy to use. It only 
takes a minute or two to get started 
with it, and it then backs up any 
changes made to the files on your 
Mac roughly once an hour. It’s easy 
to overlook some of this feature’s 
capabilities, so this cheat sheet gives an 
overview of the various ways to recover 
changed words, files you’ve trashed by 
mistake, or even your whole setup if a big 
problem occurs or you buy a new Mac.
If you use a portable Mac, you may 
notice different coloured notches in Time 
Machine’s timeline. Bright red represents 
local snapshots, which are explained 
opposite. By upgrading to High Sierra, 
you stand to benefit from an important 
improvement to when local snapshots 
are taken: your MacBook will create one 
immediately before any update to macOS 
itself is installed, providing a fallback 
should something go wrong during the 
update. Read on for more invaluable 
backup and restoration tips. 
Alan Stonebridge
HOW TO Make the most of Time Machine and Versions >
1
Restore a file or folder
Deleted a ﬁle or folder you need? 
Browse to where it was stored, then click 
Time Machine’s menu bar icon and choose 
Enter Time Machine (or use Spotlight 
to open the Time Machine app). See the 
annotation opposite for how to proceed.
2
Restore items 
Apps that don’t save documents may 
still enable you to restore items; contacts, 
or messages in Mail, say. Open the app 
and enter Time Machine; you’ll be able 
to step back in time through the app’s 
older contents and recover them.
3
Version history
Auto Save and Versions aren’t part 
of Time Machine, but work similarly and 
complement it. If an app’s File menu 
contains Revert To, it works with these 
features; as soon as you create a doc 
in an app, save it to beneﬁt from them.
If you haven’t already set up your 
first backup disk for use with Time 
Machine, connect the disk to your 
Mac; Time Machine will ask whether 
to use it as a backup disk. If there 
are files on the drive that you need 
to keep, copy them elsewhere before 
responding to the prompt. When 
you’re ready, decide whether to 
encrypt the disk’s contents, then 
click Use as Backup Disk – you may 
also be asked whether to reformat it.
Don’t carry your backup disk 
around with you, even if it’s a portable 
disk. For convenience, Time Machine 
is engineered to work with multiple 
disks, so you can back up at several 
locations. Connect a second backup 
disk to your Mac, go to Time 
Machine’s preferences, click the 
option to select a disk, then choose 
your secondary backup target from 
the list that is presented. When asked 
whether to replace or complement 
the existing disk, choose Use Both.
When you reconnect a backup 
disk, Time Machine backs up all  
changes to your Mac since that 
particular disk was last used, not 
just those since the last backup.

this works much like Time Machine, with 
one key difference: as well as rolling back 
to an older version, you can selectively  
copy from the old version (right side) and 
paste into the current one (left side).
5
Restore the system
To restore to an earlier state, hold å, 
power on, and release at the Apple logo. 
The options you’ll be shown include one 
to restore a backup; further into the 
process, you select the backup to restore 
by its time, date, and system version.
6
Migration Assistant
Already put a clean installation of 
macOS on your computer? Use Migration 
Assistant (in /Applications/Utilities) to 
restore users, ﬁles, apps, and settings, 
Again, you can choose the date and time 
of a backup, plus what to restore from it.
EXPLAINED Time Machine’s interface >
1
The timeline
Move the pointer over 
the timeline at the bottom 
right of the screen. Each 
notch in it represents a 
backup’s date and time, 
starting with the most

The window
Click a backup in the timeline 
and the window in the centre 
(Finder, or the Time Machine-

Select one or more files 
in the Finder window. Click 
the Restore button to get 
the selected version back, 
or click the cog button in 
the toolbar to find ‘Delete 
All Backups of [selection].’
4
Local snapshots
If a MacBook is away from its 
backup disk, Time Machine 
can use the built-in drive for 
local snapshots. Bright red 
backups can be restored 
right away. Dimmed ones 
require your backup disk.

  How to work your 
way around and use 
the new-look App Store
 
YOU’LL NEED
  iOS 11 
To say the App Store has 
undergone something of 
a change in iOS 11 is an 
understatement. It’s been 
redesigned from the ground up, and the 
changes aren’t purely cosmetic. The App Store 
has been reorganised – for example, splitting 
games away from apps ensures anyone who 
likes one but not the other gets a better 
experience – and has introduced more Apple- 
created content in the form of the new Today 
tab, where tips, features and other content 
serve to highlight apps, games and 
developers, plus provide you with useful tips.
Like all change, getting used to where 
everything now resides can be a bit tricky, but 
whisk through the following tutorial and you’ll 
soon know where everything is. One word of 
warning: the ‘Offload unused apps’ feature 
(see step 12) should be used with caution – 
restoring an app relies on it still being in the 
App Store. If it disappears from the store, 
there won’t be any way to bring it back. 
You have been warned. Nick Peers
HOW TO Navigate the new-look App Store

Split sections
Games and apps now reside in 
separate, eponymous tabs, allowing you

other – maybe you’re just not fussed 
about games. Their pages sport a new 
look too, with new sections to explore.

you’ll see that listings also benefit from

Master iOS 11’s Files app
Manage files in various locations and work remotely with other people
IT WILL TAKE
  5 minutes
YOU WILL LEARN
  How to make use 
manage documents 
and collaborate on 
them with other people
 
YOU’LL NEED
  iOS 11 
When the new Files app was 
announced, it sounded like 
an iOS equivalent of macOS’s 
Finder, enabling you to view 
and organise all the files on your device. 
It isn’t quite that. For a start, your docs are 
not all visible in Files unless you add them 
to the app; you can’t even see your device 
among the default Locations until you add 
at least one file to Files.
Once you start using it, though, the 
app offers a convenient central point from 
which to view and manage your iCloud Drive, 
Google Drive, Dropbox, and other cloud 
storage locations, as well as files on your 
device (after you’ve pointed the app at them, 
anyway). You can move, rename, and 
organise files, sort them by name, date, size, 
or custom tags you’ve added, and more. 
The bonus is that if you have Pages, 
Numbers, and Keynote documents stored in 
iCloud Drive, the Files app also enables you 
to collaborate on these with other people, 
in real time. You can collaborate on other file 
types, too. Here we’ll show you how, and 
explain some of the app’s quirks. Note that 
some devices offer extra options — drag and 
drop on iPad, for example. Alex Summersby
 HOW TO Manage & share documents 
1
Enable On My Device
Your iOS device is not included under 
Locations in the Files app right away. So in any 
app – Photos, say – pick a file, tap its Share 
icon, and swipe to the left in the bottom row of 
options until you see Save to Files, then tap it.
2
Save a file to enable
Next tap On My iPhone/iPad. You can 
save only into your existing Pages, Numbers, 
and Keynote folders, so pick any of these and 
tap Add. Now when you open the Files app, 
your device appears in the list of locations.
Genius tip!
 On the Files app’s 
Browse screen, tap the 
location where you want 
to add a folder. If you 
want it to be in ‘On My 
[Device]’, you can’t add 
it at the top level, only 
inside an existing folder, 
so tap into one of those. 
Drag the screen down 
slightly and tap the New 
Folder icon – top left 
with a plus sign on it. (If 
you don’t see this or it’s 
greyed out, the cloud 
service you’ve chosen 
doesn’t support new 
folders.) Name your new 
folder and tap Done.

FEBRUARY 2018 | MACFORMAT | 57
4
Tag your files
To duplicate, rename, move, delete, or 
share a file, hold a finger on it and pick the task 
you want in the pop-up. Select Tags to apply a 
tag (or several). To find all files with a given tag 
quickly, tap that tag on Files’ Browse screen.
5
Recents and Favourites
Files you access in the Files app get added 
automatically to Recents, so you can access 
them again quickly. For fast access to folders, 
add them to Favourites: hold a finger on a 
folder, and select Favourite in the pop-up.
6
Share files
Hold a finger on a file and select Share, or 
alternatively tap Select (top right), tap a file or 
multiple files to select them, then hit the Share 
icon at bottom left. You can share in all the 
usual ways — AirDrop, Message, and more.
7
Collaborate with others
With a Pages, Numbers, or Keynote file 
in your iCloud Drive, you can also invite other 
people to work on it with you. At the foot of the 
Share sheet, tap Add People, pick how to send 
invites, then tap Share Options below.
8
Set access levels
Set who can access the file and what they 
can do. With the settings shown, invitees who 
sign in can all see everyone’s changes in real 
time, colour-coded so you know who’s done 
what. Learn more at bit.ly/iwork_collaborate.
Genius tip!
 Deleting a ﬁle or folder 
in Files doesn’t trash 
it at once, just move 
it (and in the case of a 
folder, all its contents 
and subfolders) into the 
Recently Deleted folder. 
It will be deleted for 
good after 30 days 
(sooner in the case of 
some cloud services), 
but if you change your 
mind in the meantime, 
you can hold a ﬁnger on 
it and choose Recover.
Genius tip
 You can add more ﬁles 
to a folder using Save to 
Files (see step 1) or drag 
and drop on an iPad. To 
move a ﬁle elsewhere, 
drag and drop it on iPad, 
or hold a ﬁnger on it 
and select Move. Note: 
If a ﬁle is on your device 
and you want to move 
it to iCloud, selecting 
Move will not move it 
but copy it. If you’re 
sure you don’t need the 
original anymore, you 
can delete it yourself, 
leaving the copy only.

3
Add other services
Install other cloud storage apps and 
set them up, then open Files and tap Edit (top-
right of the Browse screen). Activate (or hide) 
the locations you want, and change their order 
by dragging on the handles on their right side.

  How to use Workflow 
to send the same email 
to a list of people, but 
with a personal touch
YOU’LL NEED
  An iPad or iPhone, 
Workflow 1.7 or later
Whether you’re announcing 
an engagement or the birth 
of a child, or you just want 
to send a family photo round 
to everyone without using Facebook, 
copying and pasting a templated email 
and filling in the blanks is a chore on a Mac, 
never mind on iOS. There is a better way.
If you’ve used the free Automator utility 
that’s been included with macOS for years, 
you’ll find the basic principles of Workflow 
for iOS are similar. If not, here’s a summary of 
how it works: you assemble actions in an order 
that achieves your particular goal. The output 
of one action can flow directly into the next, 
all working together to process information, 
and each action taking you a step closer to 
your goal. As you use the app, you’ll see this 
flow of info represented as a line that runs 
vertically from one action to the next.
Data doesn’t have to be passed forward, 
though; if the next action in sequence is 
not designed to take the kind of output the 
previous one produces, there won’t be a line 
between them. This doesn’t mean the first 
action’s result is lost; Workflow holds on to it, 
and you can retrieve that information easily 
later on. That’s because Workflow 1.7 added 
a feature called Magic Variables to save you 
effort — and to make workflows easier to read 
by not needing explicit actions to preserve and 
retrieve info. We’ll use this to piece together 
an email. Once you create this workflow, 
you can save it to reuse over and over!
Break it down
Before building any workflow, take a moment 
to list what info it needs from you or an app, 
and the steps you would perform manually to 
achieve your goal. Our example will ask for a 
subject line, body text (excluding a greeting 
and sign-off), and a photo attachment.
We’ll need a list of recipients who are to 
receive an email, with their address in the 
To field and first name in the greeting. 
Familiarise yourself with Workflow below, 
open the app, tap Create Workflow, select 
Normal, and then read on. Alan Stonebridge

HOW TO Automate mail merge for emails 
1
Start with a subject
Type ‘ask’ in the search bar (top left), 
and drag Ask for Input from the results 
into the pane on the right. Set the 
question to ‘What’s your message’s 
subject?’ Leave the answer empty, 
and set the input type to Text.
2
Set the body
Add a second Ask for Input action 
below the existing one. Set its question 
to ‘What is its body (without greeting/
sign-off)?’ and the answer and input type 
as before. It’s correct that no data is 
passed down to this action.
3
Select pic & people 
Find the Select Photos action and 
add it at the bottom of the workflow. 
Our example allows attachment of 
one image. Find and add the Select 
Contact action, again at the bottom, 
and allow multiple people to be selected.
4
A safety check
Before constructing the email, we 
should check whether contacts selected 
in the previous action have no email 
address. Add the Find Contacts action 
below the others; we’ll use it to filter out 
those inappropriate contacts.
5
Filter contacts
A line tells you this gets contacts 
from the previous action. Tap Add Filter, 
then tap Group and pick Email Address, 
change ‘is’ to ‘contains,’ and replace 
‘anything’ with ‘@’. People with no email 
address will be discarded for now.
6
Repeat action
Next, add a ‘Repeat with Each’ 
action. Between the two bars this adds 
to the workflow, you’ll use several actions 
to send the same overall message, yet 
personalised, repeating until all contacts 
have been sent one.
7
Get the addresses
Note the line between the actions, 
from Select Contact all the way into 
the Repeat loop: each time the Repeat 
loop begins, it will take a new contact 
from those passed to it. Add ‘Get Email 
Addresses from Input’ to the loop.
8
Multiple addresses
The items we have now are all the 
email addresses stored for the contact 
currently being dealt with. We want just 
one, and to pick which to use if a person 
has more than one. Add a Count action 
within the loop, and set it to count items.
9
Check for multiples
Add an If action next in line. Doing 
so adds bars labelled If, Otherwise, and 
End If to the workflow. In the first, set the 
condition to check if the received number 
is greater than 1. If so, you’ll need to 
perform an extra action to offer a choice.

APPLE SKILLS iOS software
CONTINUED… Automate mail merge for emails 
10
Check input & output
Tap the If action’s title and you’ll 
see that it passes forward its input — the 
quantity of email addresses. You need 
the actual email addresses – use a Magic 
Variable: Add the Get Variable action, 
and tap Choose Variable.
11
Use a Magic Variable
Next, tap Magic Variable. All of the 
actions in the workflow will spread out 
a little, with tokens between them. Find 
the ‘Get Email Addresses from Input’ 
action in the workflow, and tap the token 
labelled Email Addresses below it.
12
Choose an address 
To list those addresses so you can 
choose one, add the ‘Choose from List’ 
action. Ensure Select Multiple is off, then 
set the action’s prompt to ‘Use which 
address for ?’ and place the insertion 
point right before the question mark.
13
Personalised prompt
It may not be obvious exactly 
who an email address belongs to, so 
let’s tailor the prompt with the name of 
the person being emailed on this pass 
through the Repeat loop. Tap the Repeat 
Item token in the keyboard’s top row.
14
What’s substituted?
After you insert the token into the 
prompt, it’ll be selected and a contextual 
panel will appear at the bottom of the 
screen. That panel should indicate that 
the contact’s full name will be used in 
the token’s place when the action runs.
15
With one address
If the contact has only one email 
address, the workflow will proceed along 
the If action’s Otherwise branch instead. 
In that branch, we need only to retrieve 
that address, so add a Get Variable 
action just below the Otherwise bar.
Magic Variables explained 
Magic Variables enables you to refer back to earlier actions’ results. This 
can also be done using Set Variable and Get Variable actions to store and 
retrieve results, but Magic Variables reduces the number of explicit actions 
in a workflow, helping to make things easier to understand. Tap where you 
need to use a result, then tap the magic wand icon above the keyboard.
Tokens representing actions’ results appear between the actions; tap one 
to use its result at the insertion point. Tap the token in that place and a panel 
at the bottom of the screen will open, showing what info from the retrieved 
result will be used – you’ll see an example soon. You’ll also find a Rename 
option above the keyboard for assigning a meaningful name, and Reveal 
Action to check where the result is from. When done, tap Go Back.

16
Retrieve the address
Tap Choose Variable in the action 
and then pick Repeat Item; it’ll appear as 
a token within the action. Tap that token 
to be presented with a list of info that can 
be retrieved from the item (a contact). 
Choose Email address, then tap Done.
17
Check your work
Check that you have two actions 
(Get Variable and Choose from List) 
between If and Otherwise, and only Get 
Variable between Otherwise and End If. 
The result that will be passed forward 
now will always be a single email address. 
18
Start composing 
We have all the info we need 
for our email. Below the End If bar, add 
a List action. Replace its first item with 
‘Hi ’ followed by a Magic Variable; use the 
techniques you already learned to set it 
to Repeat Item’s first name attribute.
19
Add prewritten body
Clear the contents of the second 
row to serve as a blank line in our email. 
Add a third row and set its contents to 
a Magic Variable containing the second 
Ask for Input action’s result. Rename 
the variable ‘msgBody’ for clarity.
20
Sign off your email
Add another blank item, then 
add two more for ‘Kind regards,’ and 
your name, for example. Add one last 
item to the list: make it a Magic Variable 
that takes the output of the Select 
Photos action, and rename that ‘Photo’.
21
Send the email!
Add Send Email next. Let it show 
its Compose sheet until you’ve tested 
the workflow. In the To row, add a Magic 
Variable for the result below End If; call 
it ‘msgRecip’. In Subject, add the very 
first action’s result; call it ‘msgSubject’.
Finishing touches
It would be useful if your workflow confirmed whether it was unable to 
send an email to any of your chosen contacts. Below the End Repeat bar, 
add a Get Variable action and set it to get the results of Select Contact. 
Next, add Find Contacts and set its filter to look for contacts whose email 
address doesn’t contain @. Add a Count action and set it to count items 
(email addresses, in this instance).
We’ll do different things based on that number. Add an If action and 
set it to ‘Is Greater Than’ and ‘0’. Under the If bar, add Show Alert with the 
title ‘Unable to send to…’, a Magic Variable in its body for Find Contacts’ 
result, and disable its Cancel button. After Otherwise, add Show Alert, 
title it ‘Success!’ and give it a suitable message. Now ask friends if you 
may test all of this using their addresses.

How to keep Pages open
Or, you can stop all apps from quitting 
automatically in this manner with:
defaults write -g NSDisableAutomatic 
Termination -bool TRUE
If either of those causes problems, simply 
repeat the Terminal command, replacing TRUE  
at the end with FALSE.
What’s even stranger about this behaviour 
is that, although these apps remove 
themselves from the Dock and app switcher, 
if you open Activity Monitor or the Force Quit 
dialog, you’ll see that they don’t actually quit 
for some time afterwards, possibly even hours.
During that period, if you double-click one 
of your documents, the hidden app springs 
back into life to open it. After a while, though, 
macOS silently closes the app, and if it’s to 
run again it will have to be loaded up afresh.
Q
If I leave the latest version of Pages 
running without open windows, the 
moment I switch to another app, it 
quits. Why, and how can I stop it?
by J A C K  F O L E Y
A
This is a behaviour which you may 
have already noticed in bundled 
apps like TextEdit and Preview, and 
is set by the developer with a flag named 
NSSupportsAutomaticTermination in the  
Info.plist file inside the app’s bundle. You can’t 
change that directly, as that breaks the app’s 
signature, which is used as a security measure.
You can alter this behaviour using the 
‘defaults’ command in Terminal. Type in:
defaults write -app Pages NSDisable 
AutomaticTermination -bool TRUE

What’s the best way to let

by M H A I R I  M C L E O D
A
So long as you both have iCloud 
accounts, the best solution is to 
share them using iCloud Photo 
Sharing. It helps if you’re both using the 
current version of iOS 11, although this should 
still work acceptably with older versions too, 
even with iCloud for Windows if you wish.
On your iPhone, turn on iCloud Photo 
Sharing in Settings > [your name] > iCloud. 
(On a Mac, it’s in Photos’ preferences, under 
iCloud.) Then in Photos, create a shared album 
containing the images you want your partner 
to see and review. Do that in the Shared 
tab, by tapping the + tool at the top.
Enter the name of the Shared Album, 
add your partner to the list of people to 
be invited, and tap Create. As they have an 
iPhone, it’s easiest to send their invitation 
to their iMessage number. After they follow 
the directions given, they’ll be able to see and 
comment on all the images and movies you 
put into your shared album. Comments can 
be up to 200 characters long.
Shared albums can hold up to 5,000 items. 
From shared 
album to print
The best solution for 
collaborating on photo 
info is to use iCloud 
Photo Sharing
They don’t count against your iCloud storage 
allowance, but there are limits to the number 
of items which can be uploaded in any hour or 
day; Apple gives these at bit.ly/support-apple-
photo-albs but you’re unlikely to exceed them. 
The finished album can then be sent to a 
professional print service.
When sharing an album with people, select from those 
listed in blue – Apple IDs – then tap Create to invite them.

High Sierra doesn’t recognise an SSD

questions 
on it. This may be simplest by making a 
bootable installer on a USB memory stick.
If you still encounter problems with 
your SSD, contact Apple support (support.
apple.com) and report them, as the issues 
will need to be fixed.
One important caution for anyone 
running High Sierra from an external drive 
is not to try to create a ‘dual-boot’ system, 
in which you switch back to running Sierra 
on the internal drive. We’ve seen reports of 
serious problems restarting in Sierra after 
running High Sierra from another volume: 
Time Machine backups being damaged and 
forcing a complete backup to be made, and 
Sierra suffering repeated disk errors with 
any connected APFS drive.
Upgrading an SSD startup disk to APFS is 
a one-way process, and getting back to Sierra, 
even for short visits, can be tricky.
Q
I installed High Sierra on an 
external Samsung 850 Evo SSD 
as my startup disk. This is inside an 
Inateck FE2010 case, so is fast and reliable. 
But not only will it not convert to APFS 
format, the Info tab in Disk Utility reports 
it’s not a solid-state drive. What’s wrong?
by P E T E R  H I L L M O R E
A
There’s almost certainly nothing 
wrong with your SSD or its case, 
but this is a bug in High Sierra 
10.13. The 10.13.1 update fixes several bugs 
in APFS and Disk Utility, and you may find 
that system version now correctly identifies 
the SSD, and can format it in APFS.
Download the current High Sierra 
installer from the Mac App Store and start 
again, formatting the external drive from 
scratch and installing a fresh copy of 10.13.1 
High Sierra’s Disk Utility 
may not recognise that 
an external drive is an 
SSD, but should still be 
able to format it as APFS.

Drives fail in 
Time Machine
Q
When I replaced my old iMac 
with a new Retina 5K model, 
it started having problems 
backing up to my external drive 
because of an error. Extensive tests 
on the disk didn’t reveal any problems. 
When I connected a new external 
drive, the same problem occurred 
during the initial backup, with the 
report that ‘An error occurred while 
creating the backup folder’. Have I got 
two duff drives?
by R U S S E L L  C A P L A N
A
Probably not. It may be as 
simple as the drives being put 
to sleep during a backup, which 
shouldn’t ever happen, but can 
sometimes occur with the default 
settings imposed in the Energy Saver 
pane of some Mac models.
Open that pane, and ensure that the 
second checkbox down, Put hard disks 
to sleep when possible’, isn’t ticked. Even 
with that setting, some 
hard disks still go to sleep 
and can cause this type 
of error, so you may have 
to tick the top checkbox 
to prevent the Mac going 
to sleep altogether.
In theory, this 
problem should never 
occur, as hard drives 
shouldn’t be put to sleep while a backup 
is in progress, and your Mac shouldn’t 
try making backups when it’s asleep. 
The only times it should try to back up, 
all drives should be awake and spinning. 
However, this doesn’t always work 
correctly in Sierra.

Energy Saver options vary 
according to model, but to stop 
external disks sleeping you may 
need to block hard disks and the 
computer going to sleep.

by D AV I D  S I M P S O N

GarageBand is aimed at musicians, 
to enable them to record and make 
music. You should find a general 
audio editor preferable.
Mac software GENIUS TIPS
WavePad is still going strong on four 
different operating systems, and offers 
as good continuity as any Apple app. Other 
general-purpose audio editors include 
Amadeus Pro (£54.99, Mac App Store) and 
Audacity (free, audacityteam.org).
If the clicks in GarageBand’s recordings 
are regular, they’re probably its metronome, 
which often needs to be turned off when 
recording. Use a voice template and, at the 
top right, check the metronome control is 
turned off or you may capture its clicks.
Seeking a new audio editor
GarageBand offers a template for voice recordings. Ensure 
that you turn its metronome off before recording, though.
There are many apps which will record and edit speech, 
including Amadeus Pro and Audacity.

install the latest version of Flash Player

doesn’t resolve it, use a different browser, 
switching to Firefox instead of Safari, say.
2
Set Flash off
Almost all websites now offer an 
alternative to Flash for graphical and 
related content, such as HTML5. To check 
whether your key sites can do that, set 
Flash to ‘Ask’ or ‘Off’ for each site, and 
check each works properly without it.

Remove Flash if you can
If none of the websites that you use 
rely on Flash any more, disable it totally,

Moving from another type of phone 
to iOS might seem daunting, but 
there’s an app to help you with that. 
It’s called ‘Move to iOS’ and works with 
devices running Android 4.0 or later. 
It’ll show up if you search for ‘Move to 
iOS’ on the Google Play Store – just be 
careful that you download the app 
attributed to ‘Apple Inc’ and not one 
of the third-party alternatives.
Apple’s migration tool saves you a 
lot of bother getting information from 
Android apps into their equivalents on 
your new iPhone. That’s not all it does, 
though. The latest version of Move to 
iOS saves you time by identifying iOS 
versions of your apps. For those that 
are free, you’ll be asked during the 
transfer process whether you want 
them on your iPhone – you can accept 
or reject individual apps, so this is a 
chance to ditch any you no longer use.
As for paid apps, you aren’t asked 
to buy iOS versions during transfer. 
At the time of writing, Apple’s words 
about Move to iOS mention that paid 
apps are added to your Wish List in 
the App Store app. However, iOS 11 
removed the Wish List feature and so 
far it hasn’t been restored by a smaller 
update, so you’ll need to investigate 
replacement apps for yourself.
Migrate from Android
Migrate from 
another iPhone
1
Prepare Android
Ensure Wi-Fi is on, and that both 
phones are connected to power. Check 
the total amount of information you want 
from your Android phone will fit on your 
iPhone X, including any SD card contents.
1
Kick-start migration
Turn on your iPhone X, and Bluetooth  
on the old phone, which must be running 
iOS 11. Place the phones near each other. 
The older phone confirms the Apple ID 
to be used for migration. Tap Continue.
3
Install Move to iOS
Get Move to iOS from the Google 
Play Store and open it. Tap Continue, 
review the terms, tap Agree, then Next. 
On your iPhone, tap Continue and a code 
will be displayed; enter it on Android.
2
Prepare your iPhone
Turn on your iPhone. Follow the 
steps as far as the Apps & Data page. 
Tap Move Data from Android. If you’ve 
set up your iPhone already, you can 
move data manually – see bit.ly/andtoios.
4
Transfer your data
On the Transfer Data page, select 
items and tap Next. Ignore Android if it 
says it’s finished; when the bar on iPhone 
is done, tap Continue; for items that fail 
to transfer, try step 2’s manual method.
2
Confirm the connection
Line up the image on your iPhone X 
in the viewfinder on your old model. You 
will see a message about finishing up on 
iPhone X. Enter the old phone’s passcode 
there, then follow the on-screen steps.
With iOS 11, moving to a new iPhone 
is simpler than ever: just place your 
old and new phones near each other. 
That’s all that’s required to initiate the 
migration process. You‘ll also need to 
be using iCloud to back up the older 
iPhone (Settings > [Your name] > iCloud 
> iCloud Backup); though proximity is 
enough to start the process, your apps, 
settings and other data are retrieved 
from the internet, just like in previous 
versions of iOS. You’ll also need to 
prove you own the old phone – and 
the information on it – by entering 
your Apple ID’s password.

Power off
With Siri now being invoked when 
you hold the side button (formerly 
the sleep/wake button), powering off 
can be done in two ways. Additionally 
hold one of the volume keys for a few 
seconds until options for powering off, 
Emergency SOS and Medical ID are 
shown. Alternatively, go to Settings > 
General > Shut Down. You can also use 
Emergency SOS’s shortcut – five quick 
presses of the sleep/wake button.
Lock screen 
shortcuts
The Lock screen includes 
shortcuts to the torch 
and camera features, 
which saves you opening 
Control Centre or swiping 
left. To avoid accidental 
invocation, these buttons 
require you to press firmly.
Accessibility 
shortcuts
Accessibility features 
are available by quickly 
pressing the side button 
three times. What you get 
depends on your choices 
in Settings > General > 
Accessibility and the 
Accessibility Shortcut item 
at the bottom of that page.
Call upon Siri
Many functions that used 
the Home button use the 
sleep/wake button on 
iPhone X. To call upon Siri, 
you can still say “Hey Siri”, 
but if it doesn’t respond, or 
speaking is inappropriate 
and you prefer to use the 
Type to Siri accessibility 
setting, hold the side 
button for a moment.
Apple Pay
To make a payment using a 
bank card you’ve added to 
the Wallet app, double-click 
the side button. Note that 
unlike previous iPhones, 
because opening the app 
switcher on iPhone X uses 
an on-screen gesture, you 
can call upon Apple Pay 
while in an app, rather 
than having to open Wallet.
Force a restart
Hopefully, your iPhone X 
will never play up to the 
point of requiring you 
to force it to restart.  
If it does, press and 
release the volume up 
button, repeat for volume 
down, and then hold the 
side button until you 
see the Apple logo.
Tap to wake
You can simply raise your iPhone to 
wake its screen, if Settings > Display 
& Brightness > Raise to Wake is on. 
But, you don’t have to do that, or press 
a button, to see the Lock screen; just 
tap the screen, like on an Apple Watch. 
Depending on Settings > Notifications > 
Show Previews and iPhone X’s view of 
your face, you may need to pick it up 
to read notifications – a good reason 
to add an iPhone dock to your desk.
Screenshots
Quickly press and release the 
side and either volume button 
to take a screenshot. iOS 11 briefly 
shows the image at the bottom left of 
the screen; tap that to open the Instant 
Markup tool, where you can annotate 
the screen, share it, or delete it if you 
don’t also want to save it to Photos. 
If you ignore the preview altogether, 
the screenshot will be saved to 
Photos automatically.
How to 
navigate 
iPhone X

FEBRUARY 2018 | MACFORMAT | 73
 macformat.com  @macformat
Return to the 
Home screen
The Home button’s primary purpose, 
unlike most of its other interactions 
on other iPhones, is replaced by a  
simple, fluid gesture on iPhone X. 
Swipe up from the screen’s bottom 
edge and the current app will fade 
into the background. This displaces 
Control Centre, of course, which uses 
the same gesture on other iPhones.
Open the 
app switcher
With no Home button to double-click 
to open the app switcher, another 
on-screen gesture is used. Swipe 
upwards as if to return to the Home 
screen, but keep your finger on the 
screen for a moment at the end, then 
release. The required delay is pretty 
short, so experiment to find a timing 
you find comfortable and reliable.
Control Centre
To open Control Centre, swipe 
down from the area at the top-
right of the screen, where status 
icons reside. Other iPhones provide 
a setting that displays the percentage 
of remaining battery power next to the 
battery icon, but limited space means 
iPhone X doesn’t offer this; open 
Control Centre to see that value. Tap 
in an empty area, even near a screen 
edge, and Control Centre will close.
Switch between 
apps more quickly
Save yourself the time it takes to 
enter the switcher and jump back 
and forth between a couple of apps. 
Instead, swipe rightwards on the bar 
at the bottom of the screen; repeat 
that to revisit even more of your 
previously used apps. This works on 
the Home screen as well as in apps, 
so you may rarely need the switcher.
Switcher 
animation 
The animation when 
you swipe up on an app 
can be misconstrued as 
closing it. That’s not the 
case; Background App 
Refresh allows it to 
keep working.

74 | MACFORMAT | FEBRUARY 2018
Force an app to quit
In the app switcher, hold a finger on 
a thumbnail until red buttons appear 
at the top left of all the thumbnails. 
Tap one to close the corresponding 
app. Only do this for problem apps, as 
you risk losing unsaved data; if an app 
uses lots of power in the background 
(Settings > Battery), think about 
disabling that privilege (General 
> Background App Refresh).
Rearrange the 
Home screen
When you’re rearranging apps, the 
Done button that ends the process is 
shown at the top right of the screen. 
You don’t have to reach all that way to 
tap it – or, more likely, use your other 
hand. Instead, swipe up ever so slightly 
from the bottom edge – too far and 
you’ll end up in the app switcher – 
and the icons will stop jiggling.
Notifications
Swipe down from the top edge of 
the screen, except from the top-right 
corner (which is reserved for Control 
Centre), to open Notification Centre. 
If you use the front-facing camera 
a great deal, though, consider swiping 
down from the area to the left of 
the notch, so that you don’t end up 
depositing oils from your fingers 
over the camera area and need 
to clean it quite so often.
Reachability
This feature is designed to lower the 
contents of the screen so you can 
interact with items near the top of it. 
Once switched on, in Settings > General 
> Accessibility, you invoke it by swiping 
downwards on the Dock, starting from 
at most halfway up its height. It’s then 
easier to open Notification Centre, or 
to tap to reach the top of a view, though 
Control Centre can still be hard to reach 
when using only your left hand.
Face ID 
permissions 
In Settings > Face ID & 
Passcode, pick whether 
Face ID is used to check 
it’s really you trying 
to log in to sites in 
Safari or access 
certain apps.

Videos on a TV 
(without Apple TV)
Videos downloaded from the iTunes 
Store will be HDR versions (if available)  
that look better on iPhone X’s display. 
If you use a Lightning Digital AV Adapter 
in place of an Apple TV to play from your 
phone to a big screen, turn off Settings > 
TV > iTunes Videos > Download HDR videos, 
as videos in that format don’t work with it.

iPhone X migration FEATURE
T
here are new items worth 
investigating in iPhone X’s 
Settings app. In many 
cases, the default values 
are fine, but the items that control 
how your photos and videos are 
recorded and moved around are 
important to know about, and other 
behaviours may be worth tweaking.
Picture this
The rear camera is capable of 
recording 4K video at 60 frames per 
second (fps), yet the Camera app is 
set to record at a lower quality that’s 
less demanding on storage space by 
default. You can switch to recording 
4K at 60fps in Settings > Camera > 
Record Video.
Also in the Camera app’s settings, 
tap Formats to choose whether photos 
and videos use the new HEIF and HEVC 
(High Efficiency) formats, or the more 
widely used JPEG and H.264 formats 
(Most Compatible). There’s an Apple 
Support article about differences 
and considerations at bit.ly/mfhigheff.
The high efficiency formats use a 
lot less space, which is great news if 
you take a lot of photos and videos – 
especially if you’ve bought a 64GB 
iPhone X, but you need to consider 
where else you might work with that 
media. When you share media captured 
in one of the new formats using AirDrop 
or in a message, or if you post it to a 
social network, iOS will convert it to 
ensure compatibility.
However, if you transfer media to 
your Mac then consider the version of 
macOS, the method used to transfer, 
and the Mac apps you’ll use to edit the 
media. iMovie 10.1.7 and Final Cut Pro X 
10.4 support HEIF and HEVC, but you’ll 
need to check the release notes and 
maybe contact the developers of 
other video apps you depend upon.
The format of media transferred 
using a cable depends on the Transfer 
to Mac or PC item in Settings > 
Photos. If your Mac can handle HEIF 
and HEVC, choose Keep Originals. 
But, if you use iCloud Photo Library 
to send photos and videos to your 
Mac, media uploaded to it is always 
stored in its original format; if your 
Mac can’t handle HEIF but you want 
to use that format for its space-saving 
benefits on your iPhone, you can use 
a utility such as bit.ly/mfheifcnv to 
convert HEIF to JPEG on your Mac 
for editing and sharing from there, 
plus the original for archiving.
On display
In Settings > Display & Brightness are 
options to turn off Raise to Wake and 
True Tone. The latter adjusts the 
on-screen colours to match ambient 
light, and you may want to see the 
correct colours when editing a photo 
for Flickr, say. There’s a shortcut to this 
in Control Centre: press firmly on the 
brightness slider to reveal it.
Apple’s Leather Folio case provides 
another method for waking the display 
or putting it to sleep: simply opening or 
closing the cover. You may not want the 
screen to turn on every time you open 
the cover to retrieve a bank card or 
notes from its inside pockets, though. 
In that case, turn off Settings > Display & 
Brightness > Lock/Unlock.
Apple’s iPhone X Leather Folio case mimics the 
wake-on-open/sleep-on-close behaviour from 
the Smart Cover introduced with iPad 2 in 2011.
Using the new ‘high efﬁciency’ media formats has 
little impact upon editing and publishing from your 
iPhone, but check whether your Mac can use them.

Inspiring ideas for 
revamping old  
Apple kit
REUSE 
OLD KIT
ack in the mid 90s, Apple experimented 
with licensing Mac OS to third-party 
manufacturers. It was working for Microsoft, 
so why not Apple? But Apple was mostly a hardware 
company, and as soon as other companies began 
producing Mac clones, they drastically undercut 
Apple’s prices. To avoid cannibalising too much of its 
own customer base, Apple had to produce a Mac at 
a lower price point. It did this by building a machine 
almost entirely from off-the-shelf, industry-standard 
components. Everything from the motherboard 
to the case came from suppliers that produced PC 
components. If you build a computer entirely out 
of PC components, it’s going to look a lot like a PC.
However, the Power Mac 4400 was still more 
expensive than a PC, and despite using standard 
parts, it was hard to upgrade. The CPU and graphics 
chip were soldered to the motherboard; the memory 
was an obscure and expensive variety; and the 
display still used the Apple DB-15 socket, 
rather than the ubiquitous VGA. Could 
this Mac be the worst of both worlds?

Everything about the Power Mac 4400 
was PC-esque, apart from the price!
 The Macintosh Portable weighed 7.2kg – more than five times as 
much as a MacBook Air, so no one called it a laptop. But in 1989 it was 
one of the fastest and most powerful luggable computers available, 
and the lead acid batteries could power the machine for as much 
as 12 hours. (Although this was cut in half when Apple released an 
upgrade with a backlit screen that you could actually see.) Two 
years later, Sony re-engineered the Mac Portable for Apple, 
to create the smaller, lighter and cheaper PowerBook 100.

Dead and buried, but strangely nostalgic

questions 
T  
he 4400 I have to work 
with is in pretty good 
condition, but before 
I have so much as plugged it in, 
I know with 100% certainty that it 
will not start. This is because these 
Macs use a modified version of the 
IBM AT power supply, which has 
some extra signal lines to allow a 
‘soft-on’ power switch. These are 
ubiquitous nowadays, but in the 
mid-1990s most PCs were turned on with 
a power switch that physically connected 
the mains power, rather than sensing the 
momentary press of a button. Modern ATX 
supplies will provide 5V to the motherboard, 
even when the computer is off, so it can detect 
the On button being pressed, but the AT one 
can’t do that. This means that the power 
button must run off the PRAM battery and, 
after 20 years, that battery is definitely dead.
Industry standard
And not just dead but buried too, because 
the 4400’s battery is hidden underneath the 
CD-ROM drive. To get to it, I needed to halfway 
dismantle the Mac. It was a strangely nostalgic 
procedure. I’ve been dismantling a lot of old 
Macs recently, but this didn’t feel anything 
like that. The rush of nostalgia I felt was for 
dismantling old PCs, which I haven’t really 
done for over a decade.
There’s no such thing as a classic PC, 
unless you want to go all the 
way back to the original IBM XT. 
Every desktop built since then 
is just the same ugly collection 
of components, in either a beige 
case that is more boring than 
the cardboard box it came in, or 
a black case that resembles the 
air intake of an SR-71 Blackbird 
spy plane. This 4400 belongs 
firmly to the former category, and 
once you have the lid off, there is 
almost nothing to suggest that you 
are looking at an Apple computer. 
I pulled out the PCI riser 
card, disconnected the IDE 
drive cables and lifted out the 
hard disk, floppy drive and 
CD-ROM – all of which would 
have looked completely at home 
Is the Power Mac 
4400 the same 
as the 7220?
 Yes. This was the only 
Mac sold with two 
model numbers. 
For most of the world it 
was the 4400, but the 
number 4 is considered 
unlucky in Asian 
cultures, so for Asia 
and Australia it was 
rebranded as the 7220. 
Apple hasn’t done this 
for any other device – 
even the iPhone 4.
Can I get 
an original 
replacement  
PRAM battery?
 No. Rayovac stopped 
making this part over 
a decade ago, and any 
existing stock would 
long be past its 
expiration date. You 
can buy 4.5V alkaline 
cells if you don’t want 
to assemble your own 
from three 1.5V AA 
cells. But you’ll still 
have to solder on 
the connection lead 
to connect it to 
the motherboard.
You can’t buy a replacement Rayovac PRAM battery 
these days, but you can buy 4.5V alkaline cells.

1
Memory
There are three DIMM sockets on the 
motherboard, but slot 1 only accepts 
single-bank DIMMs. Unfortunately, the 
4400 needs the rarer 3.3V unbuffered 
EDO RAM. A few companies sell used 
modules on eBay. The 160MHz model 
takes modules up to 32MB each, and 
these normally sell for £8-10 each.
2
CPU
The 603e processor is soldered 
onto the motherboard, but it is possible 
to bypass the CPU by replacing the 
L2 cache memory with an upgrade card. 
Second-hand cards occasionally pop up 
on eBay. If you can find one, a Sonnet 
Crescendo G3 upgrade with the original 
manual can sell for over £200.
3
Hard disk
The storage is the easiest part to 
upgrade. IDE drives are cheap and the 
HFS+ filing system supports drives up to 
2 million terabytes, but other limitations 
cut in before that. If you are running 
Mac OS 8 or 9, you can’t have a bootable 
volume larger than 190GB, and the 4400 
can only handle drives up to 128GB.
 HOW TO Upgrade the 4400 
Next issue
 Luis takes drastic 
measures to improve 
the performance of his 
favourite workhorse – 
the 2012 Mac mini.
in a Compaq PC from the same era. 
Underneath was the first non-standard 
component I had seen: a 4.5V battery held 
onto the motherboard with a Velcro pad.
My multimeter read less than a fifth of 
a volt remaining on this battery, which I think 
certainly qualifies as flat. Fortunately the three 
1.5V cells were very well sealed in a plastic 
housing, so no electrolytes had leaked out 
to corrode the motherboard. I snipped off 
the connector and soldered the lead onto 
an ordinary battery holder designed for four 
AA batteries, then shorted out the last set of 
contacts, so that it would work with just three 
batteries, to give me the voltage I needed. 
I taped the battery holder to the side of 
the hard disk where I could see it, so I will 
be reminded to change the batteries again, 
when this Mac refuses to start up in another 
five years from now.
Vital signs
The mounting plate that holds the floppy 
and CD-ROM drives was surprisingly hard to 
wrestle back into place. I had to line up about 
a dozen different metal 
lugs and flanges, with the 
corresponding slots in the 
chassis and the front bezel. 
Even when everything was 
aligned, it still needed a fair 
amount of force, so I spent 
half an hour fruitlessly 
searching for an obstruction 
that wasn’t there. Eventually, 
I shoved it home and plugged 
all the ribbon cables back in. 
Then I hooked up a CRT 
monitor with a DB-15 video 
cable and pressed the on 
button. Success! The chime of 
the firmware and chitter of the hard 
disk confirmed that we had a live, working 
Power Mac 4400.
But to what end? This machine runs Mac 
OS 8.6, just like the smaller and marginally 
less ugly Performa 6200 I resurrected two 
months ago, and I don’t think it can do 
anything extra. Even if I upgrade the hardware 
as far as it will go (see the How To above), 
there’s no software installed. 
Without an Ethernet card, I will 
have to install everything from 
second-hand CD-ROMs. This 
might be the first functioning 
Mac I don’t want to keep!
Once you have the lid off, there’s 
nothing to suggest that you’re 
looking at an Apple computer
Leaving behind the alias 
to some potentially useful 
software but deleting the 
actual app is just rubbing 
salt into the wound.

 When you think of 
action cams, you tend 
to think of GoPro, and 
the camera king is back 
with a bang. Cramming 
so much tech into such 
a compact, sturdy body 
is really impressive, as 
are the efforts to make 
transferring your ﬁles 
a little less painful. Yes, 
it’s an expensive piece 
of kit, but you get a lot

GoPro Hero6 Black
 £499.99  FROM GoPro, shop.gopro.com  FEATURES 4K video at 60fps,  
1080p video at 240fps, 12MP still image capture, waterproof up to 10m/33ft
Reviewed by PHIL HALL AND MATT SWIDER
simple swipes and taps enough to access 
settings and make quick changes. 
The Hero6 Black offers voice control, and 
there’s now a Wake on Voice function. Turn 
the camera off with a voice command and the 
Hero6 Black will run in a low-power listening 
mode, waiting for the command “GoPro turn 
on”. Leave it longer than eight hours and it 
shuts down completely.
With its excellent slow-motion options, 
this camera is built for catching action. You’ll 
benefit from the enhanced performance if you 
want to record video at ‘normal’ frame rates 
too. As mentioned, the image stabilisation has 
been beefed up, with footage slightly cropped 
to reduce shakiness. The camera delivers 
improved dynamic range, resulting in better 
image quality in low light. Raw support is 
also welcome. 
GoPro tackles offloading large file sizes 
with a three-pronged approach. First, this 
camera supports High Efficiency Video 
Coding (HEVC), which can halve file sizes. 
Second, the Hero6 Black utilises the 5GHz 
wireless frequency for improved transfer 
rates. Lastly, QuikStories returns as a way 
to transfer and compile your footage into an 
automatic, editable video collage, adding 
transitions and even music.
The GoPro Hero6 Black specs are 
incredible. 4K at 60fps and super-slow-
motion 240fps at 1080p footage in such a 
small, versatile action camera make it a 
cinematic marvel. At £500, though, it’s £100 
more than its now-cheaper predecessor, the 
Hero5 Black. And that’s before you factor in 
mount accessories.
Is slow-motion video worth the extra? 
Not for most people. But everyone can make 
use of the improved image stabilisation, wider 
dynamic range and better performance in low 
light, while the faster transfer speeds and 
small file sizes are a good universal perk. 
These things are worth the step up in price.
T  
he new GoPro Hero6 Black can 
capture super-slow-motion video 
at a high resolution, output a 
stabilised image in 4K, and transfer 
everything to your phone at fast speeds.
The biggest update is the arrival of the 
GP1 processor. This allows the Hero6 Black 
to offer 4K video capture at a smooth 60fps. 
It can also capture 1080p Full HD footage at 
240fps. Between these extremes, it’s possible 
to shoot 2.7K footage at 120fps.
GoPro hasn’t just concentrated on 
boosting its frame rate. Thanks to the GP1 
processing engine, it’s possible to have image 
stabilisation active while shooting 4K footage. 
Stabilisation is capped at 30fps (for 4K), but 
it’s available at up to 120fps at Full HD. The 
Hero6 Black can capture 12MP images in 
single, burst and time-lapse modes, and 
there’s a new built-in HDR (High Dynamic 
Range) mode for high-contrast scenes.  
The device is as compact as ever, feels 
durable and is waterproof down to 33ft (10m) 
without need of a housing. The absence of a 
housing means there’s no casing to get in the 
way of the microphone, so audio quality is 
good. If you want to take the Hero6 Black 
deeper underwater, the optional Super Suit 
housing offers protection down to 60m. The 
camera also comes with a sturdy plastic frame 
that allows for a range of camera mounts. 
Touch and voice
There’s a two-inch touchscreen on the back 
for reviewing video and photos and adjusting 
settings, and it uses a tiny touch-based user 
interface. It’s actually not too fiddly, with 
GoPro’s best, most powerful action camera ever
 With plenty of great 
upgrades to video, file 
transfers and more, 
this is the best action 
camera available.
+++++
 Improved frame rates

 Much better Wi-Fi

Thanks to the processing 
engine, it’s possible to have

High-capacity storage in a convenient package
T  
here are routers,

are ‘supervector’ 
routers. AVM’s new 
flagship brings the latest 
‘Wave 2’ MU-MIMO version 
of the 802.11ac standard, 
supports ADSL/VDSL 
broadband connections, 
has USB for drive sharing, 
features guest network 
support for guests or

capacities ranging from 
4TB to a huge 16TB. 
The Duo is configured as 
RAID1 by default, which 
cuts storage in half but offers 
data protection when one 
drive fails; you can also 
reformat and trade security 
for maximum storage 
capacity. The unit gets a bit 
noisy during read/write 
activity, so you’ll want to 
place it away from your desk.
It takes only a few 
minutes to set up, and with 
WD Discovery for macOS 
installed, mounts on the 
desktop like other volumes. 
There’s a mobile app for 
automatic backup of photos 
and videos or viewing 
content from anywhere, 
but the lack of native iPad 
support is a disappointment.
Transfer rates are good: 
around 90MB/s read and 
60MB/s write, making the 
drive fast enough to play 
1080p HD video. Handy 
when using the Plex Media

calls, you can retrieve your 
voicemails from anywhere. 
The router even supports 
35b supervectoring for 
faster broadband data 
reception (not yet supported 
by UK ISPs). The future 
possibility of this isn’t 
enough to plump for the 
router alone, but the phone

Vinpok Bolt
Magnetic USB-C protection
T
he thing everyone 
seems to miss 
on current 
MacBooks is the MagSafe 
port. Apple’s magnetic 
connector didn’t make the 
leap to its USB-C charge 
cables, leaving a gap for 
third-party cables to plug. 
Unlike rivals such as Griffin’s 
60W BreakSafe cable, Bolt 
supports the higher demands 
of the 15-inch MacBook Pro.
As Apple’s USB-C ports 
aren’t magnetic, Bolt has two 
bits: the cable and a magnetic 
tip you can leave in your Mac; 
an extra tip is $20 (about £15).
With your MacBook on a 
tabletop, a tug directly away 
from the Mac tends to pull 
the tip out of the port, but 
we’ve experienced that with 
Apple’s non-magnetic cable, 
too. The important test is 
lateral movement, and it 
doesn’t take much of that 
for Bolt to serve its purpose 
by disconnecting. 
As with MagSafe 2, we 
had variable results when 
lifting a MacBook Pro from 
a table to our lap; with care, 
Bolt remains connected, but 
it doesn’t take much tension 
for the cable to droop and 
then pull away – but then 
 $50 (about £38)  FROM Vinpok, bolt.vinpok.com 
 NEEDS MacBook or MacBook Pro with USB-C
Bolt is still doing its job, 
protecting itself as well 
as your Mac.
Our MacBook Pro 
reported delivery of 86W of 
power. To test heat generated, 
we ran an hour’s worth of 
demanding 4K to 1080p video 
transcoding in HandBrake; 
the connector didn’t get 
concerningly warm.
Bolt comes in a protective 
pouch, with a mesh net for a 
small item. It costs twice as 
much as Apple’s 2m charge 
cable, but the value of that lies 
in how much you value your 
Mac. ALAN STONEBRIDGE

Transcend StoreJet 600
A ﬂash-looking stick of storage
 £149.99  FROM Transcend, transcend-info.com 
 FEATURES 240GB storage, USB 3.1 Gen 2 port
F
lash storage isn’t 
bound by the 
same dimensions 
as a spinning hard disk, 
and Transcend’s latest 
external SSD uses that 
to stylish effect in its 
appearance. The drive 
features a USB 3.1 Gen 2 
interface, so while it’ll work 
with a 12-inch MacBook it’s 
best paired with an iMac 
or a MacBook Pro.
The body is rounded 
along its longest edges, and 
almost entirely dark grey 
except for shiny silver trims 
around the oval ends, and 
a white logo and a small 
amount of text on the 
largest sides.
Transcend includes 
USB-C and USB-A cables 
for use with recent and older 
Macs. Sadly, no travel pouch 
is included to protect the 
drive from scuffs – that’s a 
little disappointing given the 
company includes one for the 
enclosure it bundles with its 
JetDrive range of internal 
MacBook storage upgrades.
Transfer rates from the 
drive are good, though they 
trail a little way behind 
other USB 3.1 Gen 2 SSDs 
we’ve reviewed lately. 
Sequential reading and 
writing peaked at 496.7 and 
456.3MB/sec, respectively – 
good, and just a little below 
Transcend’s claims of  
up to 520 and 460MB/sec. 
Mean average rates in our 
tests work out to 413.1 and 
349.3MB/sec; still good, 
though 24.3 and 47.9MB/sec 
slower than Samsung’s T5.

HomeKit-enabled smart light bulb
A
coustic Energy has

over 30 years. The Aego 
BT2 is a stereo Bluetooth 4.2 
speaker. It features the aptX 
audio codec for improved 
sound quality – supported 
by macOS although not iOS 
(which uses AAC). The 
addition of aptX Bluetooth is

Unlike some smart bulbs,

Getting started is 
easy thanks to built-in

connect the bulb, turn it 
on and snap a photo of the

Apple’s Home app. Just a

The device can 
be battery powered – the 
manufacturer cites 36 hours 
at 30% volume via the aux 
input; we reckon you’ll get 
about 20 on Bluetooth – but 
this isn’t a very portable 
unit. The aluminium chassis 
and quality components, 
including twin 2.5in drivers, 
add up to 2kg. 
On the rear, you’ll find a 
USB-A charging port (which  
doesn’t charge your phone 
if the power is low), plus a 
it doesn’t offer much 
additional functionality.
The bulb can create 
any of 16 million colours,

FEBRUARY 2018 | MACFORMAT | 87
T
hese are the best noise-
cancelling headphones 
on the planet. Yes, even 
better than the Bose QuietComfort 
35. The WH-1000XM2 sound better, 
are built better and offer features you 
won’t find anywhere else.
The headphones boast three 
tricks: an Ambient Mode that only lets 
in mid-to-high frequency tones; Quick 
Attention mode that allows you to let in 
outside noise; and the LDAC codec – 
alongside the widely adopted aptX HD 
standard, LDAC enables high-res audio 
playback. Neither is currently supported on 
iPhones, but these headphones also support 
DSEE HX and S-Master HX, Sony-specific 
technologies that take lossy audio from any 
source and convert it to near high-resolution.
Quality control
But why are they so expensive? Well, Sony 
has put a lot of hardware inside, not to 
mention the four microphones inside and on 
the outer earcups. Noise cancellation of this 
calibre also requires decent software. Add to 
that a touch-capacitive earcup and the price 
begins to make sense. Yet while they’re 
solidly built and super comfortable, the use 
of plastic is a little disappointing at this price.
Around the left earcup, you’ll find the 
only two buttons on the headset. There’s one

3.5mm cable, the touch controls no longer 
function, so you have to pull out your phone 
when you want to change the music.

straightforward and highs are crystal 
clear, although they can become a bit much,

Bass is weighty and has some real slam to it.
In a variety of noisy scenarios, the 
headphones performed admirably. Perhaps 
even more impressive is their ability to 
selectively allow some noises into the 
headphones using Ambient Noise mode. But 
Quick Attention mode is the star of the show 
here, allowing you to quickly pipe in external 
audio without taking off the headphones.
Sony claims the headset has around 
30 hours of battery life. It also charges 
quickly, pumping about 75 minutes’ worth 
of playback into the headphones with just 
a short 10-minute charge.
The Sony WH-1000XM2 sound great,

 £54.95  FROM Mophie, uk.mophie.com  
 FEATURES 7.5W charging, 9.7cm diameter
Design +++++
Mophie’s charger is almost entirely rubber-coated, so it’s 
also grippy on a tabletop. It has a 2.2cm smaller diameter; 
The iPhone 8’s 13.8cm length overhangs both bases, and 
the iPhone 8 Plus highlights this mat’s size, overhanging it 
by 6.1cm. In practice, though, you’ll want to leave room to 
avoid knocks to your iPhone whichever mat you choose.
Power adaptor & cable +++++
Mophie’s base has a rounded outer edge. Like Belkin’s, 
the cable slots into a recessed port and has a flush finish at 
the mat’s edge. Its adaptor is disadvantageous for a socket 
near to the ground since the cable – non-detachable here 
too – runs into the plug’s bottom. The light on the base’s 
front is arguably more discreet but a little harder to see.
Value +++++
As per the Belkin pad, the Mophie base carries the same 
price tag in Apple Stores. Beyond differences in outward 
appearance, the two mats are very similar, so value 
perception again hinges on how much you’re willing to 
pay for convenience. However, this mat’s size is a little 
conservative, especially when used with an iPhone 8 Plus.
Charging +++++
Given Mophie’s mat also puts out 7.5W, it’s understandable 
that its 3 hours 33 minutes duration is similar to Belkin’s; 
variations along the way proved minor. We can’t stress 
enough that you need to be sold on convenience for these 
mats due to price – if you often forget to charge, a 12W 
cabled adaptor best balances cost and charging time.

 FEATURES 7.5W charging, 11.9cm diameter
Belkin Boost Up 
wireless charging pad
Design +++++
Casually glance in Boost Up’s direction as you set down 
a cup of tea and you might mistake it for a saucer. Its body 
is slightly wider at the top than the bottom, with a grippy 
rubber ring on top for your iPhone, and the same material 
on the bottom to stop slippage. Its diameter is the better fit 
of these mats for iPhone 8 Plus, but still with overhang.
Power adaptor & cable +++++
Under the pad’s rim is a small cavity for connecting the 
mains cable. The other end of the (non-detachable) cable 
runs into the plug’s top; a sensible decision from Belkin as 
it means you won’t have trouble with a wall socket that’s 
low to the ground. A pinhole-sized light on top, near the 
rim, illuminates only when power is being transferred.
Value +++++ 
The Apple Store’s asking price was the going rate for 
these two mats wherever we looked. The convenience of 
inductive charging carries a premium: for £19, Apple’s 
12W USB adaptor offers faster charging, should you value 
topping up quickly; we don’t deny the appeal of simply 
laying down your iPhone in a living room setting, though.
Charging +++++
We tested without the iPhone in a case, and with iOS 11.2 
installed, which allows mats to deliver 7.5W to the iPhone. 
As expected, it took a long time (3 hours 37 minutes) 
to go from 0 to 100% – significantly longer than Apple’s 
optional 12W cabled charger, and closer to the full-charge 
duration of the 5W one Apple bundles with iPhones.

Something for nothing
GarageBand also has something rival apps 
don’t: a price tag of zero. The enormous pile 
of dollar bills that Tim Cook snowboards down

N
ot so long ago, if you wanted 
to make any kind of music you 
needed an astonishingly large 
amount of money. You’d then give that money 
to somebody with a recording studio, some 
microphones, poor personal hygiene and a 
Mac running Pro Tools, and after a day or two 
you’d emerge much poorer with a recording 
that was almost but not quite as good as what 
you’d set out to capture.
And then in 2005, GarageBand happened. 
GarageBand wasn’t the first good Mac music 
app and it won’t be the last, but it kick-started 
an explosion in DIY music making. Pro Tools 
remained the choice of studio pros, but 
GarageBand was surprisingly influential – 
and even more so when it became available 
on iOS as well as macOS. The drums in 
Rihanna’s Umbrella are from GarageBand

Things to consider…
A few advanced features to look out for
1
MIDI Out
If you want to control MIDI hardware 
from your computer, you’ll need an app that 
supports MIDI Out as well as MIDI In.
2
Tracks
Some apps limit the number of tracks 
you can have in a project, which might rule out 
your R&B remake of Bohemian Rhapsody.
How we 
tested
 In order to properly 
compare like with 
like, we used audio 
recordings exported 
from Logic Pro without 
effects or equalisation 
to see how intuitive 
the track management 
and mixers were, 
and we connected 
AKAI MPD218 trigger 
pads and a Novation 
Launchkey keyboard, 
a Samson USB 
microphone and 
an iTrack Solo guitar

record new audio.

 GarageBand is a songwriting app, 
not a digital audio workstation (DAW). 
It’s fantastically friendly and even 
non-musicians will be making music in 
minutes. The other apps are DAWs, which 
means little buttons all over the place. 
Ardour is a blank slate: it isn’t 
particularly hard to use, but you do 
need to educate yourself. Ableton’s loop-first approach is great 
for live performance but quite intimidating if you’re new or used 
to timeline-based apps. Both apps merit YouTube tutorials. 
Mulab is more accessible thanks to its excellent demo songs.
Reaper is very like Logic Pro X: there’s lots to learn and it’ll 
take you a while, but it’s worth it. And then there’s Reason, which 
is like a toyshop. If you like messing around with GarageBand’s 
smart controls – compressors, amplifiers, synths and so on – 
you’ll find Reason an absolute hoot.
 Ableton Intro is £69 but is often bundled 
with MIDI hardware. It’s a cut-down 
version of the £179 Ableton Live Standard 
with 16 tracks and a selection of its sibling’s 
features. Similarly, Reason Essentials (£89) 
is a simpler Reason 10 (£308) without 
pro-level synths and effects.
Ardour, GarageBand and Mulab are 
all fully fledged packages. And while GarageBand looks like and 
works with Apple’s Logic Pro, it is its own app; it’s not Logic Lite. 
Ardour is free but asks for donations: you can choose your price 
or compile your own builds. If you don’t, it’ll occasionally go quiet 
after 10 minutes. Reaper is $60 (about £44) unless you’re using it 
for commercial purposes.
None of these apps are expensive, but Apple’s deep pockets 
give GarageBand an unfair advantage here: with a price tag of 
zero, GarageBand is astonishing value for (no) money.
 GarageBand is all about turning 
your ideas into tunes, and the other 
apps are about creating CDs, MP3s or 
live performances. In this company, 
GarageBand is fun but limited: a tape 
recorder compared to Abbey Road.
Ableton is great for live work, but Intro 
has just 16 tracks. That limits recording 
options if you make music with lots of layers or instruments.
Reason has unlimited tracks and a surprisingly generous 
selection of things to play and poke, while Ardour, Mulab and 
Reaper are all fully fledged DAWs. That means unlimited tracks, 
automation, multicore processor support, sequencing, and a whole 
host of effects and MIDI instruments. 
Reaper includes lots of instruments and Mulab’s excellent 
MUX synth/effects plugin is a lot of fun, and these two apps are 
expandable with extra effects and instruments.
 Good music apps play well with others: 
plugins, hardware and other apps. 
GarageBand is limited in its interactions. 
It works with its iOS equivalents and 
exports to Logic Pro X, and it accepts 
Core Audio instruments and effects. 
However, some complex third-party 
instruments can be problematic. 
GarageBand’s MIDI support is strictly one-way: you can get 
notes from external instruments, but you can’t send notes to them. 
It’s a similar story with Reason, whose MIDI is one-way. Reason 
supports VST plugins and ReWire, as does Mulab – but Mulab 
does MIDI out as well as in. Ardour welcomes plugins including 
AU and VST, and claims best-in-industry MIDI sync, too.
Reaper and Ableton are more versatile, with support for 
VST and AU, ReWire and MIDI out. Ableton also has Ableton 
Link for controlling compatible iOS and Mac music apps.

 How 
do they 
compare?
 I love GarageBand – as 
always, anything that’s 
free appeals to me! But 
it really doesn’t feel 
like a ‘freebie’. I have 
dabbled brieﬂy with 
Mulab and Reaper, 
and they are different 
beasts entirely. For me, 
Mulab requires a steep 
learning curve but does 
offer a wealth of 
options. I think Reaper 
is even more involved 
but also has a lot to 
offer and supports 
a variety of plugins.
Jo says…
Intro version’s restrictions mean it’s only a little 
less limited than a demo.
Reason was only half a star from being tied 
with the winners: it’s a hoot to use and perfectly 
capable of big projects, despite being a stripped-
down Essentials app. It’s very, very good.
That leaves us with Ardour, Mulab and 
Reaper. We didn’t like Ardour’s interface very 
much, although it’s a perfectly decent app. We 
really liked Mulab’s synth engine, which is 
superb, and Reaper’s incredibly tight coding, 
which means your Mac barely breaks a sweat 
even when running at full tilt. They’re great 
value and won’t disappoint.

Elements is great

Among the benefits is

Editing is for comma- and

crivener is an app for writers 
who need to write big things – 
say, dissertations or novels. 
It’s not just a manuscript editor, although 
it’s a good one. It’s not just a publishing tool,

damn good at that as well. It’s a writing 
companion that’s with you from the ﬁrst 
spark of an idea to the ﬁnal edit.
We’d used Scrivener 2 to publish a novel, 
so decided to give Scrivener 3 something even 
more meaty: 107,422 words of non-ﬁction

gigabytes of background, and a brand-new 
project that meant collating research and 
testing different structures.

The revamped, simpliﬁed interface is superb,

to be working too. For example, you can see

recordings are searchable by

aren’t always accurate, but 
we’d prefer to start with a 
pretty good first attempt we 
can later tidy up on the Mac, 
rather than type out every 
word ourselves. It’s very 
useful. CRAIG GRANNELL
It’s not perfect – we had 
problems saving archives to 
Apollo Cloud or to internal 
device storage, and the app 
strictly works with the Zip 
file format and none of its 
variants. Working with 
cloud storage requires some 
patience as files are sent back

but it fills a void in Apple’s 
own file management.

Pad users around the world 
rejoiced when Apple announced 
drag and drop in iOS 11, but as 
with any new feature, there’s always room 
for improvement. Sure, we can finally copy 
items between different apps, but why 
not go a step further by adding the option 
to temporarily save items you’ll want to 
use again? That would be really handy.
Thankfully, that’s the premise of Yoink, 
a virtual storage shelf that enhances iOS 11’s 
drag-and-drop functionality. It’s not a 
clipboard manager in the traditional sense – 
apps like Copied are still best suited to that 
particular task – but you can drag images, 
text clippings, web addresses, and other files 
into the app, and then preview, rename, or 
organise them into stacks, which are the 
equivalent of folders on the desktop.
After debuting on the Mac four years ago 
to rave reviews, Yoink for iOS was designed 
first with iPad in mind, particularly in Slide 
Over or Split View modes alongside other 
drag-and-drop compatible apps. But the 
developers also found a way to bring as 
much functionality as possible to iPhone, 
which doesn’t support inter-app drag and drop.
Easy storage
New items can be imported from the current 
Clipboard contents or Photos and Files 
browsers, methods that work on the iPad as 
well. There’s also a Share sheet extension for 
adding content directly from other apps, as 
well as a keyboard that allows you to paste 
 An essential app 
for iPad. If drag and 
drop is Batman, Yoink 
makes a great Robin.
+++++
 App displays rich 
content previews
 Doesn’t sync its 
contents via iCloud 
VERDICT
Yoink works 
as a virtual 
storage shelf 
that enhances 
drag and drop
items from your Yoink library wherever text 
can be entered, such as Mail or Notes.
A lock button in the lower-left corner 
governs what happens when items stored 
in Yoink are dragged out of the app. Leaving 
the button unlocked moves the file, clearing 
it from the shelf at the same time; locked mode 
copies the item instead, preserving the original 
for later use. This gives you the option to use 
the app as temporary or permanent storage.
Everything saved in Yoink is also indexed 
by Spotlight, making it easy to search for 
a specific item even while the app is closed. 
Integration with iOS 11 is about as tight as it can 
be in the circumstances, with one exception: 
there’s no iCloud sync, so each device can 
access only its own saved content. Given 
that Yoink can store anything from a small 
snippet of text to a large movie file, this is 
an understandable limitation, but it would 
be nice to at least have the option.
Not every app plays nicely with Yoink all 
the time – we had occasional trouble importing 
PDF files that were originally from Mail 
attachments. This was a particular issue in 
Readdle’s PDF Expert, which is otherwise a 
model of drag-and-drop compatibility. Worse, 
the same file vanished into thin air when we 
attempted to add it while Yoink was unlocked.
This bug aside, Yoink makes an impressive 
debut on iOS, and should be considered an 
essential addition to any iPad user’s arsenal 
of truly useful apps. JR BOOKWALTER
Yoink works side by side with drag-and-drop compatible 
apps and is indexed by Spotlight for subsequent searching.

 Ever since the famous Bondi Blue iMac 
debuted in August 1998, Apple’s all-in-one 
desktop computer has been setting standards 
in gorgeous design and powerful performance. 
Apple’s innovation was as clear back then as it 
is today – the iMac was the first Macintosh to 
drop the floppy disk in favour of USB, and its 
colourful aesthetic set it apart as a playful 
pretender in a world of staid beige boxes.
Today, Apple is again pushing boundaries 
with the iMac, blessing all of its 27-inch models 
with a massive 5K (5120x2880) resolution and 
a wide P3 colour gamut. Add in Intel Core i5 
and i7 CPUs (configurable from 3.4GHz up to 
4.2GHz), a fast and capacious Fusion Drive, and 
powerful AMD Radeon RX graphics processors, 
and the 27-inch iMac is the desktop system to 
own. At WWDC in June 2017, Apple refreshed 
the entire range of iMacs, with discrete GPUs 
coming to all but the entry-level model, newer 
Intel CPUs, brighter Retina displays and more 
Thunderbolt 3 ports.
 An update in 2014 brought a £100 
price drop to the most affordable 
Mac, but rises in late 2016 added 
£80 back on. The mini comes with 
some interesting talking points: the 
entry-level model has a 1.4GHz dual-
core Intel Core i5 CPU and 4GB of 
memory, making it one of the lowest-
spec Macs around, with a 500GB 
hard drive and no display. 
Higher-end models come with 1TB of 
storage included (Fusion Drive and 
SSD options are available), 8GB of 
memory, a better graphics processor 
and either a 2.6GHz or 2.8GHz Intel 
Core i5 for £679 and £949. Those 
models can be upgraded to a Core 
i7, but there aren’t any quad-core 
options available at the moment. 
Expect updates in 2018.

Enriched Notes
Ellie Otley, Darryl Elkins 
Stormfront.co.uk
Apple’s Notes app on iPhone and 
iPad has some additional features 
in iOS 11 that make it far more 
useful than the basic notepad it 
started life as. Notes can be stored 
on your iOS device or in iCloud, 
and you can insert tables, use 
formatting such as bold/italics 
and bullets and numbering, add 
handwritten notes or doodles with 
the pen tool, and you can even 
scan documents. 
The scanning feature is more 
useful than simply taking a photo 
of a document, as the app will 
intelligently correct the angle 
and crop the image. To scan a 
document, tap the + icon, then 
tap Scan Documents. Point your 
device’s rear-facing camera at a 
document; the app will detect it, 
highlighting it with a yellow box 
and take a picture automatically. 
Tap Save to keep the scan; you 
can even scan pages one after 
the other and save them 
together as one item.

 The baby of Apple’s laptop family, 
the MacBook was updated at WWDC 
2017 to get Intel Kaby Lake processors 
and faster SSDs. Weighing in at just 
0.92kg, it’s Apple’s most lightweight 
laptop but still packs in a 226ppi pixel 
density in its 12-inch Retina display.
The MacBook is powered by an Intel 
Core M processor (configurable to Core 
i5 or i7), which doesn’t require a fan to 
keep cool, so the MacBook runs silently. 
It also features a Force Touch trackpad, 
which can trigger different responses 
as you apply more pressure. All models 
of the MacBook come loaded with 8GB 
of 1866MHz memory, which can be 
boosted to 16GB, and Intel HD Graphics 
615 – an upgrade from the previous HD 
Graphics 515 – and there are 256GB or 
512GB flash storage options. There are 
four colour options: Silver, Space Grey, 
Gold, and Rose Gold.
 Apple debuted the new MacBook Pro 
in October 2016 with an OLED strip of 
app-specific controls called the Touch 
Bar. The Force Touch trackpad was made 
larger to give more room for gestures, 
and the keyboard was also updated to 
have a second-generation version of the 
butterfly keys from the 12-inch MacBook. 
The MacBook Pro range then got a 
further boost at WWDC 2017, when both 
the 13-inch and 15-inch models had their 
processors updated to Intel’s Kaby Lake 
models. The larger of the two also had 
its graphics card upgraded to give more 
powerful Radeon Pro options.
You get two or four Thunderbolt 3 
ports (depending on the model), which 
are also compatible with USB-C devices, 
and through which you can charge the 
MacBook Pro. The 13-inch and 15-inch 
sizes remain, although the entry-level 
13-inch lacks a Touch Bar.

 Apple always had to do something big 
for the iPhone’s tenth birthday, and it’s 
done that with the iPhone X. Sporting a 
glass back to allow wireless charging and 
a gorgeous edge-to-edge, OLED, Super 
Retina display measuring 5.8 inches 
across, it’s big news all over.
Its better cameras don’t just mean 
great photos – they allow for Face ID, 
the face-scanning technology that is the 
latest, safest way to unlock your phone 
(goodbye Touch ID and Home button).
But don’t let the new kid on the block 
overshadow the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus – 
they’re great phones in their own right. 
They get wireless charging too, plus 
revamped cameras, a new A11 Bionic 
chip, and new augmented reality tech.
All new models come in 64GB and 
256GB capacities. The pricing for the 
iPhone 8 starts at £699, the 8 Plus at 
£799 and the iPhone X at £999.
 Apple shifted the iPad range around in 
March 2017, replacing the iPad Air 2 with 
a 9.7-inch model simply called ‘iPad’. The 
entire Air range has been phased out, 
but the iPad mini 4 is still available.
The 9.7-inch iPad features an A9 CPU 
and M9 motion coprocessor, and comes 
in 32GB and 128GB storage flavours. The 
Retina display has been made brighter 
compared to the Air 2, but the new iPad 
is slightly thicker and heavier. It’s also 
got an 8MP rear camera and a 1.2MP 
front-facing camera.
On the software side, the iPad adds 
multitasking features, which are a boon 
for productivity. You can slide a second 
app over the right side of the one you’re 
working in, then dismiss it to get back to 
work. Picture in Picture enables you to 
watch video in a corner of the screen. 
There’s also Split View, which lets you 
work on two apps side by side.

 The Watch is Apple’s quiet revolution, 
and it’s now the number one watch in 
the world. Series 3 is meant to cement 
that status quo.
To achieve that, Series 3 lets you 
make and receive calls from your wrist 
for the first time – the sci-fi dream is 
now a reality. You can also stream Apple 
Music to the device, giving you one more 
reason to leave your phone at home.
Performance-wise, the processor has 
seen a 70% speed boost, and the new

 If you’re not fussed about 4K but still 
want exceptional image quality, this IPS 
display is truly superb. It offers 99% 
coverage of the Adobe RGB colour space, 
10-bit colour and a 2560x1440-pixel 
resolution. It has HDMI 1.4, DVI and Mini 
DisplayPort connections, and four USB 
3.0 ports for expansion.
 We love this display. At 32 inches 
diagonally it’s big enough to make its  
4K resolution worthwhile, and its colour 
rendering is excellent – 100% of sRGB, 
93% of Adobe RGB and 97% of the P3 
gamut that Apple’s new MacBook Pro 
uses. It’s big, bold, beautiful and superb 
for productivity and colour work alike.
 With two blazing fast Thunderbolt 3 
ports and a 5Gbps USB-C port to boot, the 
Drobo 5D3 can provide you with rapid file 
transfers to and from your Mac. You can 
load it up with up to five HDDs or SSDs of 
differing capacities, giving you plenty of 
flexibility for storage options. It’s pricey, 
but a worthy investment.
 This router has an awful lot going for it. 
The winner of issue 321’s group test, the 
Asus scored an impressive five stars in 
three out of four categories. It performed 
brilliantly in our tests, has excellent 
connectivity (with both Ethernet and 
ADSL options), and it looks great too. It 
will keep your network powered for years.
 The Eco-Tank ET-2600 has a fairly high 
cost, but its innovative cartridge-free 
design will save you a ton of money 
in the long run. It’s got a scanner and 
copier, plus Wi-Fi and USB connectivity. 
Replacement inks are cheap, working out 
at a mere 0.2p per page for mono text, 
and just 0.35p per page for colour.
 The winner of 
MF317’s head-to-head 
review introduces a 
whole new level of 
connectivity to your 
Mac. Equipped with 
two Thunderbolt 3 
ports for blazingly fast 
file transfers, plus many more ports, you 
won’t be lacking options to hook up your 
devices. And it can even charge the latest 
15-inch MacBook Pro.
 This drive is the fastest portable SSD 
we’ve ever tested. Freecom claims its 
write speeds can reach 700MB/sec, but 
in our tests it blazed past that to reach 
713.8MB/sec write speeds and 907.3MB/
sec read speeds, thanks to its USB 3.1 
Gen 2 capability. It’s costly, but worth

 It’s hard not to love 
Affinity Photo. Whether 
you’re fancy yourself 
a seasoned pro or a 
photo novice, you will 
find it powerful and 
easy to use. Its interface has the perfect 
blend of ease of use and quick access to 
powerful features, and its useful batch 
processing is a great addition. An app 
that packs both power and practicality 
for less than £50? We’re in!
 Apple’s Final Cut Pro 
has always been a good 
option for video editors, 
but the latest version 
makes it even better. 
It introduces ‘roles’, 
which can be colour-coded to make your 
timeline’s components easier to navigate, 
something that’s further boosted by the 
streamlined interface. It supports the 
Touch Bar, too, plus wide colour on the 
new MacBook Pro.
 Ever since Apple 
stopped updating iWeb, 
Mac users have been 
searching for the ideal 
replacement. Well look 
no further – it’s 
RapidWeaver. Don’t know code? No 
worries, RapidWeaver lets you design 
visually if you want to. You can build any 
type of page and publish to any type of 
platform, and extend its functions with 
thousands of addons.
 It’s not often that a 
sequel is even better 
than its predecessor, 
but Scrivener 3 is a 
great example. Version 
2 was already good, 
winning MF319’s group test, but version 
3 adds so much. Its revamped interface 
is hugely customisable, its templates are 
fantastic, managing footnotes is a breeze, 
and the whole app is light and speedy. If 
you write, Scrivener is absolutely essential.
 When disaster strikes 
and your hard drive 
fails, having a backup 
can be a lifesaver. This 
app makes creating and 
restoring from backups 
an absolute breeze. It comes with a helpful 
guided restore feature, plus a Cloning 
Coach that monitors what you do and 
looks out for potential problems. If you’re 
looking to clone or back up your hard 
drive, this is the app you need.
 If you love making 
music and want an 
app that blends power 
with incredible ease of 
use, Mulab is our pick. 
It was joint winner of 
MF322’s group test (alongside Reaper) 
thanks to its blend of features, ease of 
use and great value, handily beating some 
big names in the genre. It works with loads 
of plugins too, so there’s plenty of scope 
to try new things.
 Feeling inbox anxiety? 
The solution could be 
Spark, a free email app 
for Mac and iOS. It’s 
centred on a ‘smart 
inbox’, which prioritises 
your emails based on importance – no 
more losing that vital work email among 
a sea of spam. You can snooze emails 
and be reminded of them later, and 
search via natural language too. And 
to top it all off, it’s free.
 If you find your 
calendar and reminders 
are getting out of 
control, Fantastical is 
the app for you. It 
supports natural 
language entry, so that you can enter 
events and reminders as you would speak 
and Fantastical will get to work. It’s got 
a nifty menu bar window, plus a great 
interface, clever calendar management 
and a powerful iOS app to boot.
 Despite strong 
competition from the 
likes of Tidal, Apple 
Music and Amazon, 
Spotify is our top music-
streaming choice. It 
hits all the right notes, from its fair price 
to its curated playlists. Its library is one 
of the largest on the market, and its 
interface is simple and straightforward 
to use. And, unlike Apple Music and 
Tidal, it has a free tier as well.

Written by Alex Blake 
The ‘store 
within a store’
 Apple didn’t always 
run its own standalone 
stores. For years it had 
operated like many 
other computer makers 
and had its products 
sold through third-
party stores. However, 
their employees were 
often poorly trained 
and did not help to 
improve Apple’s brand 
image or loyalty with 
customers. When Steve 
Jobs returned to the 
helm, he slashed the 
number of stores Apple 
computers were sold in 
and focused efforts on 
running a ‘store within 
a store’ at CompUSA. 
Even so, this situation 
did not give Apple full 
control of the retail 
experience – for that, it 
would have to open its 
own stores, which it 
began doing in 2001.
The Company 
Store
  From 1993 until 
2001, there was only 
one Apple Store in the 
world that was open to 
the public. It was the 
official Company Store, 
located inside Apple’s 
Infinite Loop campus. 
It felt somewhat like a 
museum gift shop, and 
sold Apple-branded 
hats, shirts, mugs and 
more. In 2015, it closed 
for the summer and 
reopened as a proper 
Apple Store, and has 
since been reborn as 
a visitor centre.
Resellers 
 Official Apple Stores 
aren’t the only places 
you can buy Apple tech. 
There is a network of 
authorised resellers, 
service providers and 
training centres that are 
all approved by Apple to 
sell Apple products and 
services. You can find 
your nearest approved 
third-party store at 
locate.apple.com/uk/en.

May 2001
 The very first Apple 
Store opened at 10am 
on 19 May 2001. It was 
located in Tysons 
Corner Center in 
McLean, Virginia. The 
second store opened 
three hours later in 
Glendale, California. 
2006 
 Earning $1 billion a 
year sounds good, but 
Apple knew it could 
do better. Two years 
later in 2006, Apple 
Stores were earning 
$1 billion per quarter, 
a clear sign that the 
company’s store 
strategy was working.
2011 
 After accelerating to 
$9 billion in sales and 
$2.4 billion in profit in 
2010, Apple Stores 
cracked the $10 billion 
sales barrier in 2011.
May 2014 
 Angela Ahrendts, the 
former CEO of fashion 
brand Burberry, is 
appointed Senior Vice 
President of Retail at 
Apple. She leads the 
expansion of stores 
in China, and works 
to renovate numbers 
of existing stores.
F
ew companies have 
had as much retail 
success as Apple. 
Far from the plain, boring 
computer stores of old, 
Apple Stores have vibrant, 
exciting shopfronts and 
offer the complete Apple 
experience to legions of 
loyal fans. How did Apple 
get to such a strong position 
in the retail environment? 
Let’s take a look. 
2004 
 Apple didn’t sit on its 
laurels. Three years 
after the first Apple 
Store opened to the 
public, the company 
cut the ribbon on its 
100th store, located in 
Bethesda, Maryland.
Apple Store history
How Apple built the coolest shops on the planet
2010 
 Apple Stores have 
always been popular, 
and by 2010 they 
averaged 13,800 
visitors a week. About 
10 years earlier, rival 
Gateway considered 
250 visitors a week 
a success story.
2004
 A mere three years 
after the first Apple 
Store opened, Apple’s 
retail locations across 
the world had reached 
a total of $1 billion in 
annual sales. That 
made Apple the 
fastest retailer in 
history to reach that 
impressive mark.
December 2017 
 Apple hit the magic 
number of 500 Apple 
Stores when its first 
store in South Korea 
opened in Gangnam. 
Hitting that milestone 
in rival Samsung’s 
home nation must 
have sent a message.
