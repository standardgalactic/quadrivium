RESEARCH HANDBOOKS ON GLOBALISATION AND THE LAW
Elgar Research Handbooks are original reference works designed to provide a 
broad overview of research in a given field, while at the same time creating a 
forum for more challenging, critical examination of complex and often under-
explored issues within that field.
  Chapters by international contributors are specially commissioned by the 
editors, who carefully balance breadth and depth. Often widely cited, they present 
expert scholarly analysis and offer a vital reference point for advanced research. 
Taken as a whole they achieve a wide-ranging picture of the state-of-the-art.
  The volumes in this series examine the legal dimensions of issues arising out 
of an increasingly globalized world. Edited by leading scholars in their respective 
fields, they explore notions of global justice and global development along with 
the complexities of international institutions and private actors operating on a 
global stage. Taking as their common thread the impact of globalisation on the 
world in which we live, they are unrivaled in their blend of critical, substantive 
analysis and synthesis of contemporary research.
  Each Handbook stands alone as an invaluable source of reference for all 
scholars of globalisation. Whether used as an information resource on key topics 
or as a platform for advanced study, volumes in this series will become definitive 
scholarly reference works in the field.

Introduction: understanding transnational 
corporations in the 21st century
Alice de Jonge and Roman Tomasic
The past few decades have seen an acceleration in the globalisation of 
the international economy. This process has been assisted by advances in 
communications technology and reductions in transportation costs for 
globally oriented actors. Many actors have played a part in this process, 
among which Transnational Corporations (TNCs) have come to reflect 
the changes associated with globalisation more than ever before in view of 
their growing power, size and number.
This deepening global process has not developed without some per-
ceived problems calling for global solutions. These include global climate 
change, population movements and environmental disasters. A further 
problem that affects TNCs relates to the regulation of the global economy 
and the fashioning of appropriate rules and institutions to further this 
goal. In an era of legal or regulatory pluralism, we have seen many new 
norms and institutions emerge to deal with ‘market failures’.
Global corporations operate both within and between nation states. This 
can lead to major regulatory problems, as was seen during and following 
the Global Financial Crisis when large international financial institutions, 
such as Lehman Brothers, collapsed; creating problems for national legal 
systems. As Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, 
reminded us, many large corporate groups, such as global banks, are 
‘global in life, but national in death’ as the world searched for appropriate 
insolvency and corporate rescue mechanisms. Creating and maintaining 
regulatory structures and rules to deal with the problems created by TNC 
remains a major challenge.
In this book, global corporate concerns are called ‘Transnational 
Corporations’ because their operations are not only multi-­national – 
spanning and impacting on multiple states – but also affect the relations 
between and across those states, as well as impacting on global phenomena 
­transcending state boundaries.
The lives of 21st century citizens are often more influenced by the 
­activities of, and decisions made by, TNCs than they are by national 
­governments. Yet TNCs are not exposed to the same democratic controls 
that seek to align governments with the wishes of national populations.

2    Research handbook on transnational corporations
This is hardly surprising as corporations are artificial legal persons where 
control lies in the hands of narrower groups of persons. Despite the 
advances in accounting practices and market disclosure requirements 
imposed upon listed companies, it is also the case that TNC decision-­
making is rarely exposed to the same standards of transparency and public 
scrutiny that often apply to government decision-­making.
There is therefore a greater need than ever before to understand the 
nature of the modern TNC, its operations and its influence; and to under-
stand the different ways in which TNCs are being rendered more respon-
sive. The ultimate question, of course, is the extent to which, when dealing 
with global problems, TNCs can be relied upon to solve problems, rather 
than merely being seen as part of the problem. Understanding TNCs in 
their interactions with other global actors on the global stage is therefore 
an important aim for 21st century researchers, and one which this volume 
is aimed at facilitating.
In line with these aims, the first and longest Part of this volume features 
seven chapters exploring global aspects of the TNC. Chapter 1 begins by 
outlining the changing nature of the TNC – including how globalisation 
has changed the traditional corporation and how the TNC has helped 
to shape patterns of globalisation. In Chapter 2, Rachel Anderson pro-
vides a clear-­headed analysis of the different theoretical approaches that 
have been developed by scholars writing about the modern TNC. It is an 
important chapter that provides a systematic theoretical framework for 
­understanding other chapters in this volume.
In Chapter 3, Larry Catá Backer takes us back again to the inevit­
ably political nature of the modern TNC. The fact that TNCs are 
forced to negotiate with national, and often sub-­national, govern-
ments within the local territory of the relevant host state is only one 
part of this ­inevitability. The ways in which TNCs are politically 
active in ­international forums is another part. At both national and 
international levels, TNCs are forced to encounter, and engage with, 
other political actors – most notably the NGOs that seek to influ-
ence national and ­international policy agendas but also including in-
ternational ­organisations, ­including UN, ­multinational and regional 
organisations such as the various development banks, trade-­agreement 
groupings, aid agencies and regional ­organisations. Catá Backer’s 
chapter provides a sophisticated understanding of the evolving ecologies 
of relationship among TNCs, governments, other political actors and 
civil society groups. He paints a complex picture of overlapping relation-
ships of shared and conflicting interests. He also takes an important step 
forward towards developing a new meta-­theory for future analyses of 
these relationships.

Understanding transnational corporations in the 21st century    ­3
Chapters 4 and 5 provide case studies of two global regulatory systems 
formed through the coming together of TNCs, governments, interna-
tional organisations and NGOs. Maria Alejandra Gonzalez-­Perez and 
Liam Leonard examine the history, evolution and current operation 
of the Global Compact’s governance structures – beginning as an ini-
tiative launched by UN Secretary-­General Kofi Annan in 2000. Manuel 
Wörsdörfer then takes us into the world of an important private sector 
initiative – the finance industry’s Equator Principles for project financing. 
In both cases, UN and other multinational organisations have played an 
important part in influencing the eventual shape of governance structures, 
and in both cases the involvement of the private sector was – and remains – 
crucial to its viability and successful operation.
When is a TNC not a TNC? When it’s a global supply chain? For there 
are now many different types of global supply chains – some clearly iden-
tifiable as corporate groups, others less easily identified with a single cor-
porate name. In his 1988 book The Rise of the Network Society, Manuel 
Castels pointed to the rise of the network society and the network enter-
prise. Since that time, the complexity of global supply chain arrangements 
has only increased. In this context, the chapters by Jodie Kirshner and 
Andreas Rühmkorf examining different forms of corporate globalisation 
are both timely and relevant in the 21st century. Kirshner examines both 
the motives and the means of corporate global expansion. She notes that 
limited liability has made expansion through separately incorporated sub-
sidiaries attractive for companies, such that many have developed into vast 
corporate groups with multiple layers of subsidiaries under the control 
of holding companies. Such structures, however, form only part, albeit an 
important part, of the sophisticated global sourcing strategies developed 
by TNCs, usually aimed at minimising production costs. The many differ-
ent types of relationships that now exist between TNCs and their many 
foreign suppliers present major challenges for attributing accountability, 
responsibility and liability when human rights violations occur. It is these 
challenges, and the various strategies designed to address them, that form 
the focus of Rühmkorf’s chapter on global supply chains.
Part II of this volume then takes the reader into the practical realities 
of the theoretical constructs outlined in Part I. In particular, it contains 
two detailed industry case studies examining the political and economic 
motivations of corporate decision-­making and behaviour. The first of 
these explores strategies used by pharmaceutical industry TNCs and 
their industry associations to advance their economic interests through 
trade and investment agreements, with a particular focus on the pro-
posed Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement. As the implications 
of how TPP terms are implemented gradually become clearer, the chapter

4    Research handbook on transnational corporations
by Deborah  Gleeson et al. provides valuable background material and 
insights for those seeking to safeguard equitable access to medicines for all.
In a somewhat more optimistic vein, Anna Chou’s chapter examines 
initiatives in the consumer electronics industry aimed at building human 
rights due diligence into the minerals sourcing supply-­chain. Case studies 
such as these serve to ignite a conversation and provoke further critical 
thinking. Chou’s evaluation of the ways in which CSR theory has been 
applied in practice through Samsung’s business strategy introduces readers 
to the tradeoffs involved in CSR strategies. It demonstrates that key values 
can conflict with each other, inviting readers to contemplate different 
facets of the decision-­making and judgement process. Chou’s chapter 
neatly illustrates the daily realities of the theoretical dilemmas discussed by 
Kirshner and Rühmkorf in Part I of this volume.
The country studies in Part III of this volume examine different aspects 
of the fluid and complex relationships formed between TNCs and nation 
states. China is, perhaps, the country where such relationships have been 
formed on the greatest scale, and with the greatest degree of fluidity and 
complexity. While there already exists an extensive literature examining the 
foreign TNC experience in its engagement with China as a host country, 
Megan Bowman et al. provide a new perspective on China and the modern 
TNC by tracing the history and current experience of Chinese outward 
direct investment using state-­controlled TNCs as tools for achieving stra-
tegic purposes beyond short-­term business profits.
The growing influence of Chinese TNCs in the global economy makes 
the question of accountability when it comes to state-­controlled corporate 
vehicles of particular importance. Virginia Harper Ho’s chapter on the role 
of disclosure obligations as a source of accountability for Chinese TNCs 
is therefore both timely and relevant. In particular, Harper Ho’s explora-
tion of the Chinese experience demonstrates the advantages of disclosure-­
based regimes as a source of accountability for TNCs even in institutional 
contexts that limit the effectiveness of external monitoring and traditional 
regulatory tools.
TNC accountability also features as a theme in Roman Tomasic’s 
chapter examining negotiations between government and TNCs in rela-
tion to Australia’s proposed minerals resource rent tax. That chapter 
returns to an emerging 21st century theme highlighted in de Jonge’s 
chapter on the changing nature of the TNC – the desire and the need 
of governments worldwide to improve transparency, monitoring and 
accountability of TNCs in regards to their financial transactions and the 
fulfilment of ­taxation obligations and undertakings. Not surprisingly, 
TNCs have pushed back against state-­led initiatives to combat tax base 
erosion and profit shifting, and this pushback has had – and continues to

have – s­ignificant political and economic implications, both nationally and 
internationally. Tomasic’s chapter brings to life the nature of the politics 
involved in state–TNC interactions when it comes to major policy changes 
affecting, or potentially affecting, TNC profits. The final chapter, by Diane 
Kraal, also illustrates starkly the real-­life, long-­term and historical impli-
cations of TNC power and influence when it comes to national policy 
decision-­making. Important questions raised by both chapters include 
whether, when and how it is possible to ensure that TNCs involvement in 
national and international policy debates works to further the public good, 
rather than simply private gain.

1.  The evolving nature of the transnational 
corporation in the 21st century
Alice de Jonge
INTRODUCTION
Two key events held in 2015 revealed just how significantly the nature 
and role of corporations as members of global society have developed 
and changed over the past 70 years.1 In particular, global business, in the 
form of the transnational corporation (TNC), is no longer seen as operat-
ing outside of the rules of international relations; now they are seen as 
forming an integral part of global society. The first event was the 20–21 
May Business and Climate Summit.2 Held 200 days before the UN Climate 
Change Conference in Paris (COP21), the Business and Climate Summit 
provided a unique forum for business and government leaders to engage 
in dialogue on the future of global climate change strategies. The second 
event was the Fourth Annual United Nations Forum on Business and 
Human Rights held in Geneva 16–18 November, during which a promi-
nent guest list of stakeholder representatives from business, government 
and civil society engaged in dialogue on the future of human rights in a 
world where TNCs can have just as much, if not more, impact on human 
rights as governments can.
This chapter seeks, first, to examine briefly the history of the modern 
TNC since the founding of the United Nations in 1945, and, second, to 
chart the gradual evolution of regulatory norms aimed at shaping TNC 
behavior – norms which have taken shape at corporate level, at industry 
sector level, at national level and in international forums. Finally, this 
chapter highlights three recent developments with important implica-
tions for the future direction of the TNC in global society: (1) the 
drafting of a new instrument on TNCs and human rights, (2) the move 
towards taxation accountability for TNCs indicated in the Organisation 
for Economic ­Co-­operation and Development (OECD)’s Base Erosion

and Profit Sharing (BEPS) initiatives, and (3) the ‘carving out’ of areas of 
national policy, including environment and health, to protect them from 
challenge under the Investor–State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions 
of the recently agreed Trans-­Pacific Partnership (TPP).
THE EVOLVING NATURE OF THE TNC
As national economies have become more open under the guidance of 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank-­led trade and 
investment guidelines (the so-­called Washington Consensus), so also have 
firms adapted their behavior to benefit from the new world order. It has 
become much easier to shift assets of all kinds (financial, human, physical) 
across national borders, and companies, along with their shareholders, 
have taken full advantage of this increased flexibility. Intra-­firm trade 
has accelerated, and cross-­border direct and portfolio investments have 
mushroomed.3 In certain industrial sectors – including pharmaceuticals, 
semiconductors, telecommunications, accounting and financial services – 
cross-­border mergers and acquisitions, strategic alliances and international 
redeployment of corporate resources suggest a qualitative change in the 
nature of transnational corporate behavior.4
The first notable feature of the qualitative change affecting corporations 
at the global level relates to sheer size and weight. Global corporations 
now have revenues that rival the entire GDP of many countries. Of the 
100 largest economies, 50 are global corporations while 49 are countries. 
The combined sales of the world’s top 200 corporations account for over a 
quarter of world GDP. Sheer economic weight means that TNCs can and 
do exert a great deal of influence over decision makers and over peoples’ 
lives generally. This influence is compounded by close connections and 
communities of interest linking TNCs to each other.
A 2011 study conducted by complex systems theorists at the Swiss 
Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich combined the mathematics 
used to model natural systems with comprehensive corporate data to 
map ­ownership among the world’s TNCs.5 The authors’ analysis of the

­relationships of control among 43,000 TNCs identified a relatively small 
group of companies, around 300, mainly banks and mutual funds, holding 
controlling interests in the majority of the world’s corporate assets.
The Swiss Federal Institute study complements other recent studies 
which have also (though less comprehensively) examined changing 
patterns of corporate ownership in the United States and elsewhere. 
Armour and Gordon, for example, noted that ownership patterns in the 
United Kingdom and the United States have changed – and converged – 
quite dramatically over the past decades.6 The US stock market, previously 
notable for its widely dispersed ownership pattern, in the 21st century has 
shifted so that institutional investors are now the dominant owners of US 
stocks. Similar change has occurred in the UK, but this time the change 
has been away from the cohesive, clubby domestic institutions of 1980s 
London towards a much more eclectic and international mix of passive 
funds, activist investors, private equity and sovereign wealth funds – very 
similar to, indeed often the same as, those which dominate the US market.7 
The number of TNCs from developing nations has also grown, and a large 
proportion of these are State-­owned. The UNCTAD World Investment 
Report 2014 noted that there were around 550 State-­owned TNCs, 
from both developed and developing countries, in 2013, with more than 
15,000 foreign affiliates and foreign assets of over $2 trillion. Although 
their number constituted less than 1 per cent of all TNCs, State-­owned 
TNCs accounted for around 11 per cent of global FDI flows in 2013, 
making them FDI heavyweights compared with their privately owned 
counterparts,8 though this trend has since declined.9
Along with changing patterns of ownership have come changing 
­patterns of doing business. In particular, the formation of flexible and 
mobile global supply chains has now become a key aspect of success for 
some of the world’s largest global corporations. What this has enabled, 
however, is the ability of firms to distance themselves from the least desir-
able, messier aspects of doing business – such as dealing with disappointed

or injured farmers, miners, workers or local communities – while retaining 
within the global brand name the most desirable aspects of doing business. 
Greater flexibility of capital and business relationships has also enabled 
the separation of taxable income from the activities that generate it, to the 
advantage of corporate profits and to the overall disadvantage of national 
tax-­funded spending.10
At national level there has been a rethink of what the growing power and 
influence of corporations means for local company law regimes. A series 
of major corporate collapses and financial crises in Asia (1997–1998) and 
globally (2001, 2008) has ensured that governments now take much more 
seriously the need for good corporate governance. Moreover, good corpo-
rate governance is now being defined much more broadly to include social 
and environmental aims.
The Socially Responsible Corporation
Globalization has had a number of implications for legal reasoning about 
the nature of the corporation at national level. First, global economic inte-
gration has facilitated, and been facilitated by, increasingly harmonized 
understandings about the nature of the corporation as a shared enterprise. 
A number of scholars have examined differences between the Anglo–US 
understanding of the corporation as an owners’ (shareholders’) enterprise, 
on the one hand, and the continental European–German model of the 
corporation as a ‘stakeholder’ enterprise, on the other.11 Over the past 
few decades, however, there has been a convergence of these two models, 
with company law in common law systems becoming more attuned to the 
interests of non-­shareholder stakeholder groups, while company law in 
civil law systems has become more open to assertions of shareholder rights 
and powers.12
These shifts have occurred in a number of different ways. First, common 
law systems have increasingly become open to interpreting the directors’ 
duty to make decisions ‘in the best interests of the company’ broadly 
to allow for stakeholder concerns. In 2006, the UK Companies Act was

specifically amended to provide that, when considering what would be 
‘most likely to promote the success of the company’ a director should have 
regard, inter alia, to:
(a)	 the likely consequences of any decision in the long term;
(b)	 the interests of the company’s employees,
(c)	
the need to foster the company’s business relationships with suppliers, 
customers and others,
(d)	 the impact of the company’s operations on the community and the 
environment,
(e)	
the desirability of the company maintaining a reputation for high 
standards of business conduct.13
The UK government has also confirmed that pension fund trustees are 
not prohibited from considering social, environmental and ethical issues 
in their investment decisions, provided they act in the fund’s best interests. 
Similarly, the Australian Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations 
and Financial Services has also stated that the Australian Corporations Act 
of 2001 ‘permits directors to have regard for the interests of ­stakeholders 
other than shareholders’.
As well as new understandings of what ‘good’ corporate governance 
encompasses, new understandings of what constitutes a ‘viable’ and 
‘worthwhile’ enterprise are also emerging and being recognized as having 
legal validity. Social enterprises and Benefit or ‘B’ Corporations have now 
been recognized in a number of American, South American and European 
jurisdictions. In other cases, the law, as is not uncommon, still lags behind 
some of the more advanced and ‘disruptive’ technological innovations 
and enterprise forms, most noticeably in the case of the sharing economy. 
While these newer and more innovative enterprise formats remain, as yet, 
local variations on the traditional corporation, and so are beyond the 
scope of a volume on TNCs, their implications for the future of TNCs are 
unknown and could well be transformative.

Japan and, to a lesser extent, mainland China, internationalization has

been combined with deregulation and greater shareholder ­orientation – 
and a shift away from network-­oriented governance practices to more 
market-­oriented practices.14 In the Netherlands, for example, an increas-
ing number of foreign professional investors, an expanding shareholder 
base and pressures exercised by institutional investors to limit the use 
of anti-­takeover devices, have all led to a shift in power in favor of 
­shareholders.15 A new Law on Large Companies, which came into effect 
on 1 January 2013, allows large Dutch companies to choose either a 
­one-­tier or two-­tier corporate structure, abolishing the ­previously com-
pulsory requirement for all companies to have a supervisory board in 
addition to a management board, and thereby rendering Dutch cor-
porate structures much more familiar to Anglo–US investors.16 Large 
Dutch companies listed internationally in London or New York have 
long been able to escape stakeholder requirements of Dutch law and 
began to abolish stakeholder institutions such as the works council, 
a civil-­law institution designed to give employees a voice in company 
decision-­making.17 
In addition to new thinking about corporate accountability, in many 
nations there has also been a re-­think of corporate liability, both criminal 
and civil, associated with evolving notions of corporate ­responsibility.
New Thinking about Corporate Criminal Liability
The concept of criminal liability and its application to corporations has 
been a particular focus of reform, as states have examined whether – and 
how – corporations can be held liable for wrongful conduct. Many ­countries, 
including Brazil, Bulgaria, Luxembourg and the Slovak Republic, still do 
not recognize any form of corporate criminal liability. Other countries, 
including Germany, Greece, Hungary, Mexico and Sweden, while not 
providing for criminal liability, nevertheless have in place regimes whereby

administrative penalties may be imposed on corporations for the criminal 
acts of certain employees.18
Traditionally, countries where criminal liability does extend to corpora-
tions have adopted a ‘derivative’ liability approach, whereby the corpora-
tion is held liable for the acts of one or more individual offenders. Under 
the vicarious liability or respondeat superior approach, used in US federal 
criminal law and in South Africa, the offenses of individual employees 
or agents are imputed to the corporation where the offense was commit-
ted in the course of their duties and intended, at least in part, to benefit 
the corporation. Another variant is the ‘identification’ model found in 
the United Kingdom and other British Commonwealth nations. Under 
this model, the offenses of individual senior officers and employees are 
imputed to the corporation on the basis that the state of mind of these 
senior officers and employees is that of the corporation. An expanded 
version of this approach, found primarily in continental Europe, retains 
the focus on the actions of high-­level officers and employees, but also 
incorporates a duty of supervision, although whether that duty is owed 
by the corporation or its officers individually varies from country to 
country.19
More recently, experts have adopted a more sophisticated, alternative 
understanding of corporate criminal liability, focused on the acts or 
­omissions of the corporation itself. Under this model, rather than the 
corporation being liable for the acts of individual offenders, a corpora-
tion is liable because its ‘culture’, policies, practices, management or 
other characteristics encouraged or permitted the commission of the 
offense. Australia is a prime example of this ‘organizational liability’ 
approach.20
Extra-­territorial and Transnational Accountability of TNCs
As noted above, globalization has resulted in a shift from country-­specific 
operating models to global models of corporate operation, based on matrix 
management and integrated supply chains. Governments have been forced 
to recognize the challenges these shifts represent to national legal systems. 
If corporations can simply evade the coverage of national laws by shifting

the relevant component of their existence to a different jurisdiction,21 then 
national governments must either seek to expand the coverage of national 
laws through extra-­territorial legislation, and/or they must cooperate with 
other nations in creating transnational regulatory frameworks that operate 
without regard to national boundaries. Both of these things have occurred.
Extra-­territorial Civil Liability
The US Alien Tort Claims Act (1789) (ATCA) is possibly the most 
­well-­known example of extra-­territorial legislation used by plaintiffs in 
claims against TNCs. The ATCA essentially gives US federal courts juris-
diction over claims by aliens (foreign nationals) for torts committed in 
violation of the law of nations.22
By 2010, the ATCA had resulted in only three jury trials in cases involv-
ing TNCs, resulting in two verdicts for the defendants,23 plus one in favour 
of the plaintiffs.24 But these were just part of a series of legal decisions 
raising expectations that the ATCA could provide an avenue through 
which foreign plaintiffs could seek relief against TNCs. Until September 
2010, when, in a 2–1 decision, the US Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit held that corporations cannot be held liable for violations of 
­(customary) international law, essentially on the grounds that international 
law does not recognize corporate liability.
Although the plaintiffs were granted review of the Second Circuit’s 
decision,25 the appeal was not successful. In 2013, the US Supreme Court

under the ATCA and that nothing in the ATCA rebuts that presumption.26 
At least for the time being, therefore, the ATCA remains closed to claims 
against TNCs.
International Enterprise Liability (Multinational Group Liability)
Within the context of civil liability, the international enterprise liability 
approach recognizes that when a parent and its subsidiaries are part of 
an economically integrated enterprise, there is, in effect, a single corpo-
rate actor – the multinational group. In doing so, this model of liability 
allows courts to overcome the fiction of the ‘corporate veil’ that deems 
each separately incorporated subsidiary as a separate legal person, so that 
liability is imposed on the parent firm for the conduct of the group. At 
least in common law jurisdictions, however, there are as yet only limited 
signs that the concept of international enterprise liability is being accept-
ed.27 In Canada, the international enterprise liability approach has been 
recognized in contaminated-­sites legislation.28 In the United States, the 
milestone cases of Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. and Daimler AG v. 
Bauman29 appear to have closed off many jurisdictional avenues for holding 
TNCs accountable. At the same time, however, they have given rise to new 
thinking, and new approaches to TNC liability for abuses committed by 
subsidiaries abroad are being explored – including approaches which seek 
to ‘pierce the corporate veil’ using arguments akin to international enter-
prise liability.30 The fact remains, however, that the current legal landscape

Extra-­territorial Legislation against Corruption, Money Laundering and 
Terrorist Financing
Possibly the most successful examples of an internationally ­coordinated 
network of legislation targeting TNCs (and individuals) acting illegally is in 
the (mostly) criminal law area of combating corruption, money-­laundering 
and terrorist financing. The UN Convention Against Corruption (CAC) 
entered into force in December 2005 and obliges member nations to take 
anti-­corruption measures in the public and private sectors, including 
measures against bribery of foreign officials, trading in influence and the 
concealment and laundering of the proceeds of crime.
The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) of 1977 is the most 
widely enforced anti-­corruption law. It was the first to introduce corpo-
rate liability and extraterritoriality for corruption offenses. Following the 
US precedent and the coming into force of the CAC, the UK Bribery 
Act of 2010 established company liability for corrupt acts committed by 
persons acting on behalf of the company anywhere in the world. The Act 
prohibits both bribery of public officials and business-­to-­business bribery. 
Article 13.3 of Russia’s Federal Anti-­Corruption Law No. 273 requires 
companies operating in the country to implement anti-­corruption compli-
ance programmes containing specific anti-­corruption measures. By April 
2015, there were 177 Parties to the UN CAC, making it one of the most 
widely ratified of all UN Conventions.32 Its significance here is that the 
network of anti-­corruption legislation and mutual obligations to assist in 
anti-­corruption enforcement measures established under the convention is 
something that no TNC can ignore.
The 1988 United Nations Convention against the Illicit Traffic in 
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances was the first international 
convention to criminalize money-­laundering by organizations, including 
TNCs. In 2005, the scope of the money-­laundering offense was widened 
by the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime, which

states that the offense applies to the proceeds of all serious crime, not just 
drug trafficking. The International Convention for the Suppression of the 
Financing of Terrorism came into force in April 2002 and requires member 
states to take measures to prevent their financial systems from being used by 
persons planning or engaged in terrorist activities. The Convention is sup-
ported by UN Security Council Resolution 1373 and the United Nations 
Global Counter-­Terrorism Strategy adopted in 2006.33 Each of these inter-
national law initiatives has resulted in the passing of domestic criminal law 
legislation in jurisdictions around the world with extra-­territorial impacts.
The SRSG’s ‘Extraterritoriality Matrix’
In nearly all cases of litigation against TNCs with transnational cross-­
border implications, plaintiffs have faced one or more of a number of bar-
riers to success. Most of these barriers are based on principles of private 
international law which establish limits to the exercise of state jurisdiction 
recognized by courts around the world. These principles include:
●
●
The principle of forum non conveniens, which seeks to direct legal 
actions to the most appropriate forum;
●
●
The principle of sovereign immunity;
●
●

­tensions mitigates against the introduction of extraterritorial legislation and 
threatens its effectiveness when it is enacted. This is much less likely to occur 
where an international framework for such legislation, such as the CAC, 
exists. Recognizing the need for an agreed set of principles on the legiti-
macy, usefulness and acceptability of extra-­territorial legislation, the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-­General on Business and Human Rights 
(SRSG) has developed a matrix for assessment of extra-­territorial initiatives.
In August 2010, the SRSG presented his third report on the implementa-
tion of his mandate to operationalize the ‘Protect, Respect and Remedy’ 
Framework for Business and Human Rights adopted by the UN Human 
Rights Council in 2008. Part III of the August 2010 report discusses the 
issue of extra-­territoriality in the business and human rights context. 
While recognizing that extra-­territorial legislation has often been contro-
versial, the report also recognizes that global movements of goods, capital 
and people, and the global impacts of transnational corruption, climate 
change, bio-­diversity depletion and terrorism have increased the potential 
for overlapping and/or conflicting jurisdictional claims. States have also 
recognized that effective regulation over local actors and events sometimes 
requires legislation that extends beyond national boundaries.
States have made use of domestic measures with extra-­territorial implica-
tions to help influence the behavior of private actors abroad without the direct 
use of extra-­territorial jurisdiction. Examples include asking locally incorpo-
rated parent companies to take certain steps in relation to the management 
of foreign subsidiaries. Other methods involve the use of reporting obliga-
tions, import or export controls, and taking steps to monitor and reduce risks 
associated with projects requiring export assistance. These measures can be 
highly influential in relation to private foreign conduct. They also often seem 
to attract less controversy than assertions of direct ­extra-­territorial jurisdic-
tion, presumably because they focus on acts or persons at home.
In addition, states are increasingly prepared to use direct extra-­territorial 
jurisdiction in relation to criminal activity such as terrorism, money 
­laundering, corruption and grave human-­rights breaches. Often such legis-
lation depends on the nationality of the perpetrator to justify the exercise 
of the enacting state’s jurisdictions. In competition law and securities law, 
states have made more extensive jurisdictional claims over foreign compa-
nies and conduct, sometimes extending beyond ‘territorial’ or ‘nationality’ 
based claims to jurisdictional validity and based on previously contested 
legal theories (such as the ‘passive personality’ principle) or the universality 
principle when it comes to internationally recognized crimes.
The reactions of states – both to domestic measures with ­extra-­territorial 
implications and to direct extra-­territorial jurisdiction over private actors or 
activities abroad – depend greatly on regulatory motives and modes, and on

the potential for inter-­state regulatory conflicts. To facilitate a more nuanced 
discussion of extra-­territoriality, the SRSG has constructed a heuristic 
‘extra-­territoriality matrix’ with two rows and three columns. The matrix 
shows that extra-­territoriality is not a binary matter, but encompasses a 
wide range of possible regulatory actions, not all of which are equally likely 
to trigger objections. The matrix begins with two rows, representing a dis-
tinction between (a) domestic measures with extra-­territorial implications; 
and (b) direct extra-­territorial jurisdiction over actors or activities abroad. 
Its three columns represent a range of regulatory approaches, from policy 
based to regulation and enforcement actions. It seems that policy based or 
‘principles based’ and ‘outcomes oriented’ regulation is less problematic for 
TNCs and their home states than more prescriptive legislation.35

22    Research handbook on transnational corporations
Much of recent debate about the use of direct extra-­territorial jurisdic-
tion, and its implications for state sovereignty, has focused on its use in 
the antitrust (competition law) field. Certainly the use of direct extra-­
territorial jurisdiction here, especially where based on the ‘effects doctrine’, 
has contributed to inter-­state tensions. While there now appears to be 
greater acceptance of this jurisdictional basis, problems remain, includ-
ing inconsistent standards between states, which can create compliance 
­challenges and uncertainties for companies. On the other hand, states have 
exhibited greater consistency and cooperation regarding conduct that 
they can agree is pernicious or immoral, such as participation in illegal 
cartels, highlighting the importance of international dialogue and soft law 
­standards in building greater convergence of standards and approaches. 
When it comes to extra-­territorial regulation, concerns about certainty, 
legitimacy, efficiency and competitiveness are nearly always expressed 
in relation to unilateral rather than collective actions. For business, as 
for states, extra-­territorial measures remain much more acceptable and 
­effective if they are based upon collective measures, and it is to such 
­measures that this chapter now turns.
BRINGING TNCs INTO THE GLOBAL 
ACCOUNTABILITY SPHERE
Globally, a number of multinational efforts have been made to build regu-
latory structures designed to guide TNC behavior and, to a lesser extent, 
to render TNCs accountable for breaches of accepted standards. Some 
of these multinational regimes are limited to TNCs, while others (like 
the Global Compact) extend their coverage to other (business and non-­
business) organizations as well. These measures are similar to state regula-
tory measures based on internationally agreed standards, such as the CAC, 
but different in that they rely upon TNC action, rather than government 
action, for their implementation and effectiveness. As with voluntary codes 
at corporate, sector and national levels, such efforts have typically brought 
about meaningful results only to the extent that the relevant regime estab-
lishes standards which are measured, monitored and (rarely) enforced.
Measuring: The Global Reporting Initiative
The lack of global standards for measuring and reporting on the environ-
mental and other impacts of TNC activities has long been a weakness in 
global systems of TNC accountability. The Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) goes some way to remedying this weakness by ­establishing a

­comprehensive reporting framework for all business organizations. The 
GRI, first established in 1998, was formally inaugurated as a United 
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) collaborating organiza-
tion in 2002, the same year that the Sustainable Reporting Guidelines 
were unveiled  at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 
Johannesburg. The Sustainability Reporting Guidelines, now in their 
4th  generation (G4),36 are supported by Sector Guidance principles 
applicable to different industry sectors, and other resources all aimed at 
facilitating greater transparency and accountability. As more and more 
jurisdictions work to strengthen and expand their corporate reporting 
requirements, the GRI is increasingly being used as a reference point. 
For example, all companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange 
have been required to report in ­accordance with the GRI Guidelines since 
2003. Use of the GRI Guidelines is also promoted through cooperative 
engagement with other multinational initiatives including the OECD’s 
Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the Global Compact. For 
most companies, though, subscribing to the GRI Guidelines remains 
entirely voluntary, and there is no independent body able to monitor, 
compare and verify reports that are issued by TNC. Nor is there any inde-
pendent tribunal to which those aggrieved or harmed by TNC activities 
can have recourse.
The UN Draft Code for TNCs and the ILO Tripartite Declaration: Neither 
Measuring Nor Reporting?
The 1970s was the era of the ‘new international economic order’ and saw a 
number of initiatives aimed at bringing TNCs into the international legal 
order. A Commission on Transnational Corporations established by the 
UN Economic and Social Council in 1974 was charged with developing 
a multinational code of conduct for TNCs, and it produced a number of 
draft codes over the next two decades before the process was abandoned 
in 1994. Although never finalized as a legal instrument, the experience of 
drafting a Code of Conduct for TNCs has normative value and provides 
a valuable store of experience for current and future international lawyers 
to draw upon. It is particularly valuable for the lessons it teaches about the 
pitfalls of attempting to set binding legal rules and boundaries in the broad 
and ill-­defined area of TNC responsibility.

The 1970s also saw the emergence of the International Labour 
Organisation’s Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational 
Enterprises and Social Policy (MNE Declaration). The MNE Declaration 
is a voluntary set of principles regarding employment and labor relations 
adopted by the ILO Governing Body in 1977. It has a lesser legal status 
than ILO Conventions adopted by the ILO Annual Conference, and its 
wording reflects its voluntary nature. While ‘requests for interpretation’ 
of Tripartite Declaration are specifically provided for, there is no dispute 
resolution mechanism as such built into the Declaration. A main achieve-
ment of the MNE Declaration was to generate a follow-­up mechanism that 
asks governments, workers’ and employers’ organizations to respond at 
regular intervals to a survey questionnaire investigating aspects of national 
implementation of MNE Declaration principles. Unfortunately, response 
rates have not been high, amounting to less than 50 per cent of total ILO 
country membership, and when results of the regular survey are published, 
they are made anonymous, such that breaches of the principles by MNEs 
cannot be attributed.
Following a review of the follow-­up mechanism of the MNE Declaration 
begun in 2010, the universal periodic survey has been replaced by a greater 
emphasis on promotional activities, capacity building and consultation, 
and the compilation of relevant data from different countries into a web 
portal known as the ILO Knowledge Information Gateway.37
Reporting with (a Limited Degree of) Accountability: The Global Compact
Formally launched in 2000, the Global Compact allows not just TNCs 
and business organizations, but also public sector bodies, cities, aca-
demic institutions, NGOs and labor organizations, to sign up to a set of 
ten ­universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor 
­standards, the environment and, since early 2005, anti-­corruption. The ten 
principles are drawn from four of the most widely ratified international 
legal instruments:

the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;

Principles and Rights at Work;

the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development; and

the United Nations Convention Against Corruption.
By November 2015, the Global Compact had grown to include over 
12,000 signatories, including around 8,000 business participants. In 
November 2015, business participants included 3,447 companies with 
active participant (communicating) status. One of the most important 
commitments that a participant makes when joining the Global Compact 
is to submit annually a Communication on Progress (COP) using reporting 
indicators such as the GRI Guidelines. So far as TNCs are concerned, the 
COP must be placed on the UN Global Compact website and shared widely 
with company stakeholders. Failure to submit an annual COP results in a 
change in the participant’s status from ‘Active’ to ‘Non-­Communicating’. 
Participants who do not communicate progress for two years in a row are 
delisted. As of November 2015, 2,063 companies were recorded as having 
‘Delisted’ status on the Global Compact website.
The COP public reporting requirement was introduced in 2005 as one of 
a number of new ‘Integrity Measures’ developed in response to criticisms 
of the Compact as ‘toothless’ – allowing companies to associate themselves 
with a ‘feel-­good’ UN initiative with no need to change their operations 
on the ground at all. Other measures introduced in 2005 included strict 
rules on the use of UN and Global Compact logos and a new complaints 
mechanism. Section 4 of the 2005 Integrity Measures creates a dialogue 
process for handling ‘credible allegations of systematic or egregious abuse 
of the Global Compact’s overall aims and principles by a participating 
organization’. The purpose of the dialogue is to ‘assist participants in 
aligning their actions with the commitments they have undertaken with 
regard to the Global Compact principles’. If the participating company 
concerned refuses to engage in dialogue on the matter within two months 
of first being contacted by the Global Compact Office in regard to a 
­credible allegation, it may be regarded as ‘non-­communicating’ and identi-
fied as such on the Global Compact website until dialogue commences. If 
as a result of the dialogue process and based on a review of the nature of 
the matter submitted and the responses by the participating company, the 
continued listing of the participating company on the Global Compact 
website ‘is considered to be detrimental to the reputation and integrity 
of the Global Compact, the Global Compact Office reserves the right to 
remove that company from the list of participants and to so indicate on the 
Global Compact website’.
An important achievement of the Global Compact is to facilitate 
dialogue and exchange between the language of human rights and 
the language of business management. The Global Compact’s Guide

the Good Practice Notes developed in areas as diverse as ‘Setting up a 
Multi-­Stakeholder Panel as a Tool for Effective Stakeholder Dialogue’, 
and, ‘How Business Can Encourage Governments to Fulfil their Human

The proportion of all TNCs that have signed up to be Global Compact 
participants remains low at less than 10 per cent. Country-­wise, the highest 
number of actively communicating corporate participants comes from 
France (368 active corporate participants as of November 2015). Japan 
(164), Germany (144), the United States (123), Sweden (104) and the 
United Kingdom (90) each had around the same number of national com-
panies actively participating in the Global Compact in November 2015.
A Limited Network of Accountability: The OECD Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises
The 1970s also saw the drafting by the OECD of its first set of Guidelines 
for Multinational Companies (1976). These have been developed, strength-
ened and updated on five occasions since 1976. The latest version of the 
Guidelines dates from May 201138 and describes itself as a set of ‘recom-
mendations jointly addressed by governments to multinational enter-
prises’. While ‘Observance of the Guidelines by enterprises is voluntary 
and not legally enforceable’, the Guidelines do serve as a statement of the 
standards expected by adhering home nations of their corporations oper-
ating abroad in areas such as employment and industrial relations, human 
rights, environment, information disclosure, combatting bribery, consumer 
interests, competition and taxation.
Since 2000, the OECD Guidelines have incorporated and been sup-
ported by a unique implementation mechanism of National Contact 
Points (NCPs) – agencies established by adhering governments to promote 
and implement the guidelines. By 2015, there were national contact 
points established in each of the 35 OECD nations, mostly located within 
national ministries or departmental bureaus. As part of their role in assist-
ing enterprises and their stakeholders with further implementation of the 
Guidelines, the NCPs receive and consider complaints (known as ‘specific 
instances’) lodged against any corporation operating within the national

jurisdiction of that NCP. The NCP’s role upon receiving a specific instance 
is to investigate and, if necessary, provide a mediation and conciliation 
platform for resolving practical issues that arise. Under the relevant proce-
dural guidance, NCPs issue a statement and notify the OECD Investment 
Committee of the results of any specific instance they receive, while at 
the same time ‘protecting sensitive business and other information’. By 
2015, approximately 330 specific instances had been considered by country 
NCPs, more than half relating to employment and industrial relations 
matters. In 2013 the Investment Committee established a Working Party 
on Responsible Business Conduct with a mandate to foster NCP func-
tional equivalence across national differences, promote engagement with 
non-­adhering countries, partner organisations and stakeholders, and to 
serve as a central point of information on the Guidelines.
Towards a Shared Understanding of Social Responsibility: ISO and Other 
Standards Organizations
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independ-
ent, non-­governmental membership organization and the world’s largest 
developer of voluntary International Standards. It essentially comprises a 
network of the national standards bodies of 162 ISO member countries. 
ISO standards include standards relating to occupational health and safety 
(ISO 45001), food safety (ISO 22000), sustainable events (ISO 20121) and 
environmental management systems (ISO 14000). By 2004, the ISO and its 
stakeholders had recognized the importance of, and the need to define, rec-
ognize and implement the roles and responsibilities of business in a social 
context. The ISO Working Group on Social Responsibility was established 
in 2004, and by 2009 its 91 member nations and 42 liaison organizations 
had developed a Draft International Guidance on Social Responsibility.
ISO 26000 Guidance on Social Responsibility was launched in 2010 
following five years of negotiations among representatives from govern-
ment, NGOs, industry, consumer groups and labor organizations around 
the world. Like the Global Compact before it, ISO 26000 is not limited to 
corporations, but is intended for use by public and private organizations 
of all types. ISO 26000 is not a formal ISO management system standard, 
and it is not intended for certification purposes. Rather, it comprises a 
consolidation of best practice social responsibility advice and guidance in 
seven core subject areas:

Organizational governance;

ISO 26000 is voluntary and is meant to complement and support, not 
supplant, other internationally recognized social responsibility standards. 
These include the SAI SA8000 standard for decent work.
In 1997, a multi-­stakeholder NGO, Social Accountability International 
(SAI), was founded to develop the first globally recognized accreditation 
standard relating to socially responsible employment practices. The most 
recent version of SAI’s SA8000 standard for decent work dates from 2014, 
and is the fourth issue of SA8000. It operates as a voluntary standard 
setting out the requirements to be met by organizations, including work-
place conditions and effective management systems, at each specific work-
site for which audited third-­party certification is sought. The foundational 
elements of SA8000 2014 are based on internationally recognized human 
rights norms and key conventions of the ILO. The normative SA8000 cer-
tification audit reference documents are the SA800: 2014 Standard and the 
SA8000 Performance Indicator Annex which sets out the minimum per-
formance expectations of an SA8000 certified organization. Additionally, 
the SA8000 Guidance Document facilitates compliance with the Standard 
by providing interpretations of SA8000, examples of how to implement its 
requirements and examples of methods for verifying compliance.
Protect, Respect and Remedy: Towards a Globally Recognized Framework 
for Business and Human Rights
Attempts throughout the 1970s and 1980s to draft a globally recognized 
Code of Conduct for TNCs under the auspices of the UN Economic 
and Social Council (ECOSOC) failed, for reasons examined in depth 
­elsewhere.39 Attempts to obtain ECOSOC adoption of a 1990 Draft 
Code of Conduct for TNCs were abandoned by 1994. It was just over a 
decade later before the next serious attempt at UN level to explore the 
idea of a globally recognized set of human rights principles for TNCs 
was initiated in 2005, with the creation of a mandate for a Special 
Representative of the Secretary-­General on the Issue of Human Rights

and Transnational Corporations and Other Business Organizations (the 
SRSG).
At its June 2008 session, the UN Human Rights Council was unanimous 
in welcoming the ‘Protect, Respect and Remedy’ framework for business 
and human rights, which was developed by the SRSG after widespread 
stakeholder consultations, and his mandate was extended for a second time 
to run until 2011. The SRSG’s ‘Protect, Respect and Remedy’ framework is 
built around three basic principles: the state duty to protect human rights, 
the corporate responsibility to respect human rights and the need to build 
effective public and private avenues to access remedies for human rights 
harms.
States routinely provide support and assistance to their corporate 
nationals in their global trade and investment ventures. While states may 
not intend to allow corporate nationals to violate human rights in their 
extra-­territorial operations, by their actions or omissions, states may facili-
tate or otherwise contribute to a situation in which such violations by a 
TNC occur. Extra-­territorial activities of a TNC that violate international 
human rights law can give rise to state responsibility under customary 
international law if a relevant causal act or omission can be attributed 
to one or more states. Relevant customary international law principles 
have been codified in the International Law Commission’s Articles on 
the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. An act or 
omission of a TNC can be attributed to a state if the TNC is empowered 
by that state to exercise elements of public authority, and/or if the TNC 
acts on the ‘instructions of, or under the direction or control of’ the state. 
In addition, where a state, through aiding or assisting corporate activity, 
is complicit in the commission of an internationally wrongful act com-
mitted by another state or by the company itself, then the state will be 
­internationally responsible.
So far as the corporate responsibility to respect human rights is con-
cerned, the SRSG explains that in order to fulfill this responsibility not 
to infringe on the rights of others – to do no harm – corporations must 
engage in a process of ‘due diligence’. For TNCs, human rights due 
diligence means first and foremost assessing the country context in which 
their activities take place and identifying any associated human rights chal-
lenges. Second, TNCs should consider what human rights impacts their 
own activities may have within the relevant country context within which 
they occur. The TNC should analyze the actual and potential impacts 
arising from its activities on employees, consumers, local communities and 
other affected groups. The production process, the products or services the 
company supplies, its labor and employment practices, the provision of 
security for personnel and assets, and the company’s lobbying or political

activities, all need to be scrutinized for their human rights impacts and 
adjusted if necessary to prevent human rights harms.
The third principle that TNCs should consider is whether they might 
contribute to human rights harms through the relationships connected to 
their activities, such as with state agencies, business partners, suppliers and 
other non-­state actors. How far or how deep this consideration should go 
will depend on the circumstances. The aim is to ensure that the TNC does 
not become implicated in third-­party harm through its relationships with 
these other parties. According to the SRSG, the possibility of complicity:
can arise from a company’s business activities, including the provision or con-
tracting of goods, services and even non-­business activities, such as lending 
equipment or vehicles. Therefore, a company needs to understand the track 
records of those entities with which it deals in order to assess whether it might 
contribute to or be associated with harm caused by entities with which it 
­conducts, or is considering conducting, business or other activities.
Human rights due diligence thus involves both country-­context risk 
assessment and supply-­chain assessment. In terms of country-­context 
risk assessment, the OECD has developed a Risk Awareness Tool for 
Multinational Enterprises in Weak Governance Zones, as well as a Due 
Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from 
Conflict-­Affected and High-­Risk Areas.
Outside of the minerals sector, TNCs have developed a number of 
approaches to address the many human rights gaps and challenges pre-
sented by 21st century supply chain systems and arrangements. These 
include setting clear expectations with suppliers for responsible business 
conduct through codes of supplier conduct – currently the most common 
application of the MNE Guidelines to supply chain relationships.40 
Consequences for non-­compliance with codes can vary significantly – 
from limited or no action taken by the TNC to requirements to participate 
in monitoring and remediation, to consequences with direct impact on 
the business relationship such as suspension of new orders or contract 
cancellation.

RECENT TRENDS: THE FUTURE OF TNCs IN 
GLOBAL SOCIETY
A Legally Binding Global Framework for TNCs?
As the result of a September 2013 proposal bringing the issue of a ‘legally 
binding framework to regulate the work of transnational corporations’ 
back to the UN agenda, a vote was taken at the Human Rights Council 
on 26 June 2014. Two relevant resolutions were tabled at the 26th session 
of the Human Rights Council in Geneva in 2014. One, signed by Ecuador, 
South Africa, Bolivia, Cuba and Venezuela, and supported by 20 countries 
in a vote,41 proposed the establishment of ‘an open-­ended intergovern-
mental working group with the mandate to elaborate an internationally 
legally binding instrument on Transnational Corporations and Other 
Business Enterprises with respect to human rights’ (resolution 26/9). The 
other (resolution 26/22), drafted by Norway, supported by 44 co-­sponsors, 
and adopted by consensus by all regions, does not support a binding 
legal instrument, but opts instead to continue the mandate of the UN 
Working Group on Business and Human Rights for another three years.42 
While including a request that the UN Working Group prepare a report 
considering, among other things, the benefits and limitations of legally 
binding instruments,43 its main thrust is to reaffirm the normative content 
of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs), 
focusing on improved domestic measures to implement the UNGPs, and 
improved access to remedies for victims of business-­related abuses.
The first session of the open-­ended intergovernmental working group 
took place from 6 to 10 July 2015 in Geneva and reflected the con-
tentious nature of the debate between those who argue in support of 
41  The vote was taken, and the resolution adopted, on 26 June 2014. Those 
in favor were Algeria, Benin, Burkina Faso, China, Congo, Cote d’Ivoire, Cuba, 
Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Morocco, Namibia, Pakistan, 
Philippines, Russia, South Africa, Venezuela, Vietnam. Countries which voted 
against were Austria, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, 
Japan, Montenegro, South Korea, Romania, Macedonia, UK and USA. There 
were 13 abstentions (Argentina, Botswana, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Gabon, 
Kuwait, Maldives, Mexico, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, UAE).

binding mechanisms to address business and human rights, and those 
who prefer pursuing the more voluntaristic path laid out by the UN 
Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.44 Those in favor of 
a binding instrument argue that the Guiding Principles, while widely 
accepted, have proven insufficient and have not provided accountability 
or real remedies for corporate abuses. Those against a binding instru-
ment maintain that the Guiding Principles need more time and effort 
to fully develop their potential and that the pursuit of a treaty may 
obstruct this goal and become an excuse not to implement the Guiding 
Principles.45
Ultimately, it is likely to depend very largely on TNCs themselves, 
whether they pressure governments not to cooperate with any treaty-­
drafting process or whether, as in the case of the Global Compact, they 
become actively involved as participants. For unless TNCs themselves are 
actively involved in the drafting and ‘maintenance’ of a binding treaty, 
they are unlikely to either ‘own’ it or to recognize its legitimacy. So far, 
signs are that the Working Group set up to draft the treaty has yet to gain 
any convincing amount of support for its work from either governments 
or business. This does not necessarily mean that its work should cease, 
simply that energy should not be taken away from continued pursuit of 
the Guiding Principles. In other words, the debate should not be about a 
‘Guiding Principles’ path versus a ‘treaty path’.
One of the main reasons for the success of the Global Compact has been 
that businesses actively decide for themselves when and how to sign up, 
implement and further the Global Compact agenda. Engagement can be 
minimal or fully activist. While it can be argued that the Global Compact 
contains no mechanism through which victims of TNC human rights 
abuses can obtain remedies, its transparency mechanisms – in particular 
its regular reporting requirements – do provide for accountability. More 
important, the Global Compact continues to demonstrate a promising 
capacity for self-­strengthening. The Global Compact Integrity Measures, 
including the introduction of public reporting requirements and a com-
plaints mechanism, were added in 2005; largely in response to criticisms 
of the Compact as ineffective and toothless. If the complaints mechanisms 
could be built upon and strengthened to include access to remedies, then

the Global Compact could become a key part of integrating TNCs (as well 
as other organizations) into the global regulatory order.
Responsible Fulfilment of Taxation Obligations
Taxation is at the core of countries’ sovereignty, but the interaction of 
domestic tax rules in some cases leads to gaps and frictions. The exist-
ing regime of domestic rules and over 3,800 bilateral double-­taxation 
treaty regimes has, over time, developed weaknesses and gaps that create 
opportunities for base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).46 In particular, 
the spread of the digital economy has given rise to fundamental ques-
tions about how to determine residence and/or the jurisdiction where 
value ­creation occurs for tax assessment purposes. BEPS relates chiefly to 
instances where the interaction of different tax rules leads to double non-­
taxation or less than single taxation. It also relates to arrangements that 
achieve no or low taxation by shifting profits away from the jurisdiction 
where the activities creating those profits take place. No or low taxation is 
not per se a cause of concern, but it becomes so when it is associated with 
practices that artificially segregate taxable income from the activities that 
generate it.47 The concern is that rapidly increasing amounts of income 
generated by an increasing number of cross-­border transactions and a 
volume of cross-­border activity may go untaxed.
In the changing international tax environment, countries have expressed 
concern about how international standards on which bilateral tax treaties 
are based allocate taxing rights between source and residence states.48 At 
the urging of G20 finance ministers, the first version of an OECD action 
plan to address BEPS issues in a coordinated and comprehensive manner 
was issued in 2013. In October 2015, the OECD released its final BEPS 
Package. The Package includes reports on 15 ‘actions’, ranging from 
countering harmful tax practices and treaty shopping to addressing trans-
fer pricing, interest deductibility and transparency, to exploring the tax

implications of the digital economy.49 The end result of the BEPS Package 
should be an increase in the density of the global network of transparency, 
monitoring and accountability rules to which TNCs are subjected, at least 
in respect of their financial transactions.
The BEPS Package marks the first time that real progress has been made 
towards a multinational tax regime. Its successful approval by G20 leaders 
at a summit in Antalya, Turkey, on 15 November 2015 has been attributed 
to good political timing (following the global financial crisis and at a time 
when international tax issues were the focus of global political attention), 
and the voluntary, soft-­law nature of (most of) the commitments involved.50 
The challenge will now be to expand consensus on BEPS measures beyond 
the 34 OECD and eight non-­OECD members of the G20 and to establish 
a viable and enduring third-­party dispute-­resolution regime,51 possibly by 
linking in to trade and investment-­related dispute resolution mechanisms.
Trade and Investment and Social Responsibility
The Ruggie process found a lack of integration between regular govern-
ment agencies with economic, commercial and trade mandates, and those 
with human rights mandates. Yet it identified considerable scope for trade 
and investment frameworks to become vectors for manifesting state duties 
to respect and protect human rights from adverse impacts by business 
actors. On the one hand, investor protection clauses, particularly investor-­
state dispute settlement clauses in bilateral and multilateral investment 
treaties, are seen to constrain host governments’ abilities to regulate for 
social or environmental aims that potentially impact upon investor activi-
ties. Stabilization-­clauses in investor–host-­state agreements have a similar 
effect.
However, considerable precedent exists for using trade policy to promote 
governance improvements in partner states, though these have mostly been 
effective in regard to preventing reductions in labor rights. EU trade agree-
ments, for example, have long contained human rights clauses enabling 
Brussels, in effect, to use trade-­related actions to shape the political govern-
ance of emerging market and developing country partners. Since 1995, the

51  For discussion, see Grinberg and Pauwelyn (n 45), noting that Action 14 of 
the Package identifies mainly non-­binding ways to make dispute resolution mech­
anisms under bilateral tax treaties (the so-­called Mutual Agreement Procedure or 
MAP) more effective. But it falls short of imposing binding arbitration.

EU has required all trade agreements to contain provisions linking trade 
and other preferences to the fulfillment of human rights commitments in 
beneficiary countries. Under the EU’s Generalized Scheme of Preferences 
(GSP) the EU offers developing states preferential access to the EU market 
subject to certain conditions. In addition to the core GSP tariff prefer-
ences, the EU also operates a system of positive ­conditionality: GSP+. 
Under GSP+, eligible states which commit themselves to key, universal 
obligations relating to human and labor rights, environment and good 
governance may apply for additional preferences. Under a third tier of the 
scheme, ‘everything but arms’, least-­developed states (as defined by the 
UN) can benefit from free market access for all products, except for arms 
and ammunitions.
Much of the debate during recent negotiations over the TPP centered 
on how best to balance the free trade and investment-­promoting economic 
aims of the treaty with the need to preserve state sovereignty in policy areas 
such as environmental protection and health. This balance was achieved 
through a number of carve-­out provisions, ostensibly aimed at limiting the 
potential for TNCs to seek redress from host governments in the event of 
regulatory measures impacting on company profits. In reality, however, the 
wording of the relevant provisions in the TPP reflects a minimal compro-
mise inserted to satisfy Australian demands that certain health measures, 
such as cigarette plain-­packaging laws and the Pharmaceutical Benefits 
Scheme (PBS) could not be the subject of ISDS procedures.
TPP Article 9.15, titled ‘Investment and Environmental, Health and 
other Regulatory Objectives’, ostensibly seeks to ensure that ‘Nothing in 
[Chapter 9] shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, main-
taining or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter 
that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its ter-
ritory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental, health or 
other regulatory objectives’. Article 9.15 does not so much specifically 
allow TPP parties to enact environmental and/or health-­related regulatory 
measures as it seeks to ensure that Chapter 9 itself is not used to limit the 
capacity of TPP Parties to enact such measures. Similarly, the wording of 
Article 9.16 in no way represents any sort of ‘carve out’ for ‘Corporate 
Social Responsibility’ measures that a TPP Party might seek to impose 
upon investors. Rather, its language expresses a sentiment without any 
legal effect at all:
The Parties reaffirm the importance of each Party encouraging enterprises 
operating within its territory or subject to its jurisdiction to voluntarily incor-
porate into their internal policies those internationally recognised standards, 
guidelines and principles of corporate social responsibility that have been 
endorsed or are supported by that Party.

The whole effect is compounded by the wording in the TPP Annex 
which purports to list what are and are not understood to be measures 
amounting to ‘expropriation’ – wording which leaves so much leeway for 
different definitions as to be almost entirely meaningless:
Non-­discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied 
to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety 
and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriations, except in rare 
circumstances.
This wording only protects from litigious attack public health and 
­environment measures that are designed and applied for ‘legitimate’ public 
health, safety and/or environmental objectives; measures which even then, 
in ‘rare circumstances’ (which remain undefined), can still be deemed as an 
‘indirect expropriation’.
The only clear, hard-­and-­fast carve-­out relates to tobacco control, 
which is explicitly and definitely removed from possible ISDS litigation – 
although governments themselves can still challenge other governments on 
tobacco, as part of inter-­state dispute settlement provisions.
The TPP also compares poorly to the European Union’s proposals to 
impose procedural and accountability discipline on ISDS in response to 
concerns expressed about ISDS provisions in draft treaties being negotiated 
by the EU. A 2015 EU concept paper notes a ‘new approach’ to the negotia-
tion of ISDS in investment protection treaties, both in terms of substance 
(investment protection rules) and procedure (ISDS mechanism), found in 
the recent (2014) EU–Canada and EU–Singapore free trade agreements.52 
The new approach is reflected in a number of different provisions designed 
to preserve and protect the legitimate policy-­making and associated regula-
tory space of states parties to the relevant FTA. These include:
●

The preamble in the Canada–European Union Comprehensive 
Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) which makes clear that

ment, public morals and the promotion and protection of cultural 
diversity;53

A clear, precise and closed-­text definition of ‘fair and equitable treat-

to arbitration under the CETA. Only companies with real business 
operations in the territory of one of the Parties will be covered by 
the investment protection provisions;

in Treaty-­based Investor-­State Arbitration, which are designed to 
ensure full mandatory transparency of the arbitration process. All 
documents (submissions of the disputing parties, decisions of the 
tribunal) will be made publicly available. All hearings will be open 
to the public. Interested parties (NGOs, trade unions) will be able to 
make submissions;55
●
●
Under CETA, the EU and Canada can issue binding interpretations 
on how its provisions are to be interpreted, and the ISDS tribunal is 
obliged to respect those interpretations. Governments, not tribunals, 
are thus given control over interpretation of the rules;56

CONCLUSION
Three themes running throughout this chapter characterize the evolution 
of the modern concept of corporate social responsibility, and thus of the 
modern TNC. These are: (1) an evolving understanding and acceptance 
of increased transparency; (2) an evolving understanding and (sometimes 
reluctant) acceptance of increased levels of accountability; and (3) a move 
towards greater acceptance of the need for TNCs to be involved in provid-
ing more effective remedies for individuals and groups harmed as the result 
of TNC behavior. These three themes form a constant motif throughout 
the concerns of an expanding network of stakeholders impacted by – and 
seeking to influence – TNC behavior, and throughout the various layers 
of an emerging global regulatory framework for TNCs. Transparency, 
accountability and access to effective remedies are also concerns at the 
forefront of recent developments in international tax negotiations and 
trade and investment treaty negotiations. These concerns reflect and 
demonstrate the public and social nature of the modern TNC in the 
21st century.

Global regulation of transnational corporations2.  Theoretical approaches to global 
regulation of transnational corporations
Rachel J. Anderson
INTRODUCTION
Theoretical approaches to regulating Transnational Corporations (‘TNC’)1 
have blossomed as legal and other scholars continue to study the unique 
structure of TNCs since they were first theorized in the 1960s.2 TNCs 
present challenges and opportunities for theoretical approaches to global 
regulation arising from, for example, their size, form, influence, public–
private character and multi-­jurisdictional nature. Their global presence 
and interconnectedness also create opportunities to advance a wide range 
of regulatory purposes, including goals related to development, rights and 
sustainability. Approaches to TNC regulation are embedded in broader 
legal theory as well as theoretical approaches from other disciplines. These 
approaches adapt and extend legal theory in ways that respond to the dis-
tinctive issues raised by TNCs. There are various ways to categorize theo-
retical approaches to TNC regulation. This chapter identifies six schools 
of thought: International Legal Theory, Corporate Social Responsibility 
Theory, Law and Economics Theory, New Governance Theory, Critical 
Legal Theory, and Law and Religion approaches.3

Regulatory Challenges and Opportunities
TNCs present a host of challenges for the creation and maintenance of 
international and global structures for their regulation. Some of these 
­challenges stem from their form or influence. Others stem from the way 
TNCs straddle the public–private divide.
TNCs are networks of private economic entities operating ­simultaneously 
in multiple countries that may have multiple owners and that often gener-
ate and control massive amounts of wealth.4 In the currently fragmented 
system of laws that govern TNCs, their multi-­jurisdictional presence 
allows TNCs to evade national laws and escape market forces, for example, 
through transfer pricing in intra-­company trade.5 The possibility of multi-
ple owners in varying ownership structures at multiple points in a TNC’s 
network adds to the potential for regulatory complexity and arbitrage.
Operating in multiple countries and economic sectors subjects TNCs 
to multiple regulatory jurisdictions.6 It also makes it possible for TNCs 
to engage in regulatory arbitrage.7 TNCs’ ability to influence the making 
of law and policy and to engage in regulatory arbitrage can have negative 
effects. These can be seen, for example, in the ways TNCs are able to seek 
out low-­regulation environments and avoid enforcement of existing regu-
lations resulting in employees’ physical and economic harm due to poor 
working conditions, harms to the environment, and suppression of market 
competition.8
The complexity of TNC operations can make it hard to completely and 
accurately evaluate the potential and actual effects of TNCs in the world.9

Global regulation of transnational corporations    ­41
However, there are metrics that give an indication of TNCs’ potential for 
influence individually and in the aggregate and, thus, the importance of 
regulations that shape and sanction the behavior of TNCs. The level of 
potential or actual control exercised within a TNC’s network of compa-
nies is an important indicator of the level of coordination possible among 
the different entities that make up the TNC.10 The number and location 
of TNCs’ parent companies and foreign affiliates are indicators of the 
­countries and jurisdictions in which TNCs might exercise influence. Total 
assets, revenue, profit, sales, exports of products and services, market capi-
talization, and foreign direct investment are indicators of the economic 
influence that TNCs could exercise individually and in the aggregate.11 
The number of people employed by TNCs is an indicator of the poten-
tial effects that TNCs can have around the world on working conditions, 
wealth generation and employees’ and their dependents’ economic status 
and physical welfare.12 TNC spending on research and development sug-
gests the level of TNC influence over innovation and ‘the use of the world’s 
knowledge, skills and technology’.13
As arbiters of massive amounts of wealth, TNCs have the potential to 
exercise significant influence, directly and indirectly, over all aspects of 
national and international life. TNCs can directly influence the making 
of international and national law and policy, for example, by employing 
government officials, participating on policy-­making committees, provid-
ing information and drafting services to legislators and, in some cases, 
bribery.14 TNCs can indirectly influence the making of international 
and national law and policy, for example, through lobbying or making 
campaign contributions.15 This potential high level of access and influ-
ence increases the complexity of establishing a comprehensive regulatory 
framework as it can blur the lines between the regulators and the regulated.
The emergence of TNCs also creates regulatory opportunities. The

life for people around the world. Targeted regulatory incentives for TNCs 
have the potential to encourage synergies that can advance widespread 
efficiency and plenty instead of a tragedy of the commons. Effective 
regulation of TNCs can encourage advancements through research and 
development that would have measurable benefits, for example, for human 
and enivonmental health on a global scale.
Theoretical Approaches to TNCs
TNCs in their modern form are a relatively recent development and they 
present unique regulatory challenges and opportunities. In response to the 
emergence, growth, and expansion of TNCs, existing theories have been 
adapted and new theoretical directions are being explored.
Although modern TNCs first took shape in the 1900s, commerce and 
capital crossed borders prior to the emergence of nation states.16 The pre-
cursors of TNCs date back to at least the late 14th century and include the 
Medici Bank (1397–1494), the East India Company (1600–1873), the Royal 
African Company (1672–1752) and the Hudson Bay Company (1670–
present).17 Over time, the movement of commerce and capital across borders 
has been regulated in a variety of ways. Religious doctrines guided the 
regulation of business, the rulers of communities and empires dictated the 
parameters of economic activity, and nation states established laws govern-
ing commerce within their borders. Catholicism, Judaism and Islam all have 
values and guidelines that have addressed the conduct of business and the role 
of ­economic activity in society since before the first TNCs were established.
Modern forms of TNCs did not emerge until the 19th century.18 In 1960, 
Stephen Herbert Hymer proposed what is believed to be the first theory of 
TNCs, which Hymer referred to as international operations.19 According 
to Hymer’s theory, TNCs occur when there is interdependence in transna-
tional markets, for example, international trade, combined with imperfect 
competition, a comparative advantage or other factors.20 Hymer’s 1960

insight regarding the analysis of TNCs still holds true today: the tools used 
to analyze TNCs are essentially the same as those used to analyze domestic 
corporations with the important difference that although the individual 
companies in a TNC are national, the operations of the TNC network are 
international.21
The emergence, expansion and increasing legal and financial complex-
ity of TNCs have been accompanied by the development and evolution 
of a growing body of scholarship on their regulation. Within that body 
of scholarship, legal theories of TNC regulation span a wide range of 
approaches. Some of the approaches have developed out of legal theory, 
while others are interdisciplinary. The approaches are neither uniform in 
terms of their fundamental assumptions nor in terms of the issues they 
seek to address. Often they are complementary, and sometimes they are in 
direct opposition with one another.
Although the various theoretical approaches are in different stages 
of development, several schools of thought can be observed. This 
chapter identifies and discusses six schools of thought. These schools 
of thought vary in terms of the disciplines used, underlying assump-
tions, sources of law, key actors and goals of regulation. Many of these 
­theoretical approaches began in the context of domestic regulation of 
corporations and were not applied in the international context until 
later.22
INTERNATIONAL LEGAL THEORY APPROACHES
International Legal Theory approaches seek to determine the appropriate 
status of TNCs under international law and the rights, duties, and obliga-
tions that TNCs should have under international law. These approaches 
seek to answer questions related to spheres of authority, the applica-
bility of direct or indirect regulation, the subjectivity of TNCs under 
international law, sources of law making and the source of the norms 
that apply to TNCs under international law. International Legal Theory 
approaches grapple with challenges to traditional spheres of authority

under ­international law.23 There are a wide range of International Legal 
Theory approaches to the regulation of TNCs and they include Public 
International Law and Interntional Legal Pluralism approaches.
For International Legal Theory, sources of law and key actors are 
central questions because of the absence of a central and supreme govern-
mental structure with enforcement authority.24 This is an issue that usually 
does not arise in a solely domestic regulatory context.
Public International Law
Traditionally, the Public International Law Theory branch of International 
Legal Theory defined international law as made top down by and between 
nation-­states and focused on nation-­states as the subject of international 
law.25 Under the Public International Law Theory approach, sources of law 
are generally in the form of treaties or customary ­international law.26
Over time, theories of Public International Law have expanded to 
include ­non-­states as actors ‘engag[ing] in international law activities’.27 
Some ­scholars posit that ‘international law has already effectively recog-
nized duties of corporations’28 and that corporations have rights under 
­international law.29 They posit that since corporate rights and duties have 
already been accepted by states and other international actors, this can 
be expanded to include human rights and the corresponding attribu-
tion of rights and duties to corporations.30 This approach takes existing 
understandings of liability under international law and transposes them 
onto TNCs.31 It draws from theories of state responsibility and individual 
responsibility.32

International Legal Pluralism
International Legal Pluralism posits that international law is not solely 
made top-­down through the consent of nation states.33 Scholars argue that 
international law can also be made from the bottom up.34 This section dis-
cusses Societal Constitutionalism Theory as an example of one of several 
International Legal Pluralism approaches.35
Societal Constitutionalism Theory, as the name suggests, has its roots 
in constitutional theory. It approaches constitutional theory through a 
lens informed by sociological methodology.36 The core characteristics of 
Societal Constitutionalism Theory are: ‘fracture, fluidity, permeability, and 
polycentricity’.37 The Societal Constitutionalism Theory approach responds 
to the changes globalization has had on international lawmaking.38 Under 
this approach, transnational legal fragmentation is a condition that makes 
possible the emergence of law made by non-­state actors.39 Scholars using a 
Societal Constitutionalism Theory approach theorize bottom-­up effects of 
social movements as opposed to those of top-­down global regimes.40 This 
approach addresses the question of sources of international law.
Societal Constitutionalism scholars argue that Societal Constitutionalism 
is a legitimate form of law making because subjects of international law

create law through their consent, the law is expressed, and it is effective.41 
Societal Constitutionalism varies from traditional positivism in interna-
tional law because it does not view legal rules under international law as 
only being created by the consent of states but rather also by the consent of 
non-­state actors.42 Societal Constitutionalism approaches have been used to 
theorize international operations in several economic sectors, for example, 
intellectual property, international ­accounting, and forestry and fishery.43
Societal Constitutionalism Theory responds to a gap in traditional con-
stitutionalism that omits the role of non-­state actors. It has been described 
as ‘establishing legitimate supreme authority for free and equal [people] 
engaged in a collective exercise of self-­government’.44 Others argue that the 
key constitutional question of the 20th century is ‘the control of economic 
power’.45 Societal constitutionalists argue that state-­focused approaches 
overlook ‘forms of sectoral private ordering in the world economy’.46 
Societal constitutions are either private or hybrid but not solely public.47
Traditional constitutionalism takes an approach that positions the public 
sphere and state actors as the sole bearers of legitimate constitutional 
authority.48 However, some scholars have criticized traditional constitution-
alism as being limited to protecting the private sector from the public sector 
without being able to protect the public sector from the private sector.49 In 
contrast, Societal Constitutionalism posits that ­legitimate constitutional

authority is located in both the public and the private spheres, and it focuses 
on the analysis of constitutional authority in the private sphere.50
The possibility of non-­state actors as subjects of international law 
and the expansion of sources of law under a Societal Constitutionalism 
approach makes space in constitutional theory for TNCs.51 Some scholars 
have theorized a community of TNCs made possible by globalization 
and that functions in governance gaps between national and international 
law.52 This un-­tethering of law making from geography creates the possi-
bility of extra-­territorial jurisdiction within which a ‘self-­referencing and 
autonomous regime of governance’ can exist ‘within a very narrow govern-
ance space’.53 This has also been described as the emergence of informal 
jurisdictions.54
The characteristics of societal constitutionalism (fracture, fluidity and 
permeability) are also key factors that influence the behavior of TNCs and 
other non-­state actors.55 TNCs operate in governance spaces (fractures) 
between the jurisdictional authority of countries in which they operate, 
national and international law, requirements set by other TNCs, suppli-
ers and third parties with which they interact, and gaps in international 
law itself.56 TNCs’ rules are impermanent (fluidity) and so, although struc-
tured, take different forms within an overarching framework. TNCs’ rules 
change or fluctuate as needed when they interact with other systems of 
rules (permeability).57 They are polycentric, which means that they present 
both the benefit of cooperation and the danger of collusion.58
Among other things, Societal Constitutionalism Theory makes it pos-
sible to identify moments when there is a potential for the development 
of bottom-­up law making.59 This theory posits that there are two prereq-
uisites: ‘sufficient pressure that calls for self-­limitation’ and ‘internal self-­
reflection.’60 Some international law scholars posit that corporate codes of 
conduct developed out of one such moment.61 Pressure came from public

liferation of social and ­environmental standards in government procure-
ment contracts.62 Self-­reflection took place as TNCs made choices about 
how to make internal changes in response to external pressure.63 Lastly, 
some international law scholars argue that the effectiveness of Societal 
Constitutionalism depends on the support of external constraints.64 This 
means that ‘stabilization by a legal process’ is a prerequisite for TNCs’ 
codes of conduct to become societal constitutions.65
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
APPROACHES
One of the earliest theoretical approaches to corporate regulation remains 
relevant today: Corporate Social Responsibility Theory. Early discussions 
about Corporate Social Responsibility Theory began in the United States 
in the late 1920s and they have continued through multiple iterations 
into the present.66 In the 1930s, scholars developed opposing theories of 
Corporate Social Responsibility that became foundational positions that 
have stood the test of time.67 Although Corporate Social Responsibility 
fell out of fashion in the mid-­1930s, it returned to the fore in the mid-­1950s 
and received renewed attention in the 1990s in a new iteration.68
Corporate Social Responsibility Theory has its roots in philosophy 
(ethics and morality) and philanthropy.69 The goal of regulation under a 
Corporate Social Responsibility Theory approach is to establish TNCs’

responsibilities in relation to all of their stakeholders and to consider 
society’s ­welfare.70 This can be achieved by operation of law or through 
incentives that encourage TNCs to engage in practices that are not solely 
aimed at profit maximization but are intended to strengthen positive 
effects on stakeholders or ameliorate negative effects on ­stakeholders.71 
Regulation based on a Corporate Social Responsibility Theory approach 
draws from contract law, stakeholder choices, and soft law.72 The 
Corporate  Social  Responsibility approach is often used to address 
­problems related to, for example, the environment, human rights, and 
labor.
Corporate Social Responsibility Theory posits that TNCs are a network 
of companies that have obligations to all of the actors with whom they 
interact or who are impacted by their operations.73 Scholars using a 
Corporate Social Responsibility approach have argued that these obliga-
tions and the justification for government intervention stem from a variety 
of sources. One argument is that TNCs should have legal obligations to 
stakeholders because they are similar to governments or public institu-
tions.74 This claim of a quasi-­public nature is based on their size, effects, 
capital and influence.75
Many of the problems addressed by Corporate Social Responsibility 
Theory approaches in the transnational context stem from the ways that 
TNCs are different from domestic corporations and the limitations of 
state-­based regulation. Laws tied to geographically limited jurisdictions 
may comprehensively regulate the activities of domestic corporations 
but may only partially regulate the activities of TNCs, which operate 
in multiple jurisdictions. Currently, national legal systems are unable to 
comprehensively regulate TNCs.76 Scholars also have noted that gaps 
remain despite the overlapping mosaic of national and international law.77 
that looks to businesses to achieve social good even when not required by law, from 
corporate responsibility that is required under the law’).

Corporate Social Responsibility approaches seek to fill gaps in the law 
in addition to expanding TNCs’ responsibility beyond the constraints of 
profit maximization.
Corporate Social Responsibility Theory differs from other ­theoretical 
approaches in significant ways. Unlike the Law and Economics approaches 
discussed below, Corporate Social Responsibility approaches do not view 
TNC actors as constrained to decisions and actions intended for profit 
maximization and, in fact, seek to promote goals that are not always 
related to short-­term shareholder profit. Corporate Social Responsibility 
Theory differs from Public International Law Theory in that it does not 
assume that state actors are the only makers of laws and regulations.
Modern scholars using a Corporate Social Responsibility approach 
tend to prefer the stakeholder model to the shareholder primacy model 
of corporate governance. In modern iterations of Corporate Social 
Responsibility Theory, corporate governance often plays a significant 
role, and some scholars have suggested that modern Corporate Social 
Responsibility approaches are appropriately categorized as a subset of cor-
porate governance theory.78 Corporate Social Responsibility approaches 
in the transnational context include a combination of ‘soft law’ (norms, 
voluntary regulation or self-­regulation) and ‘hard law’ (mandatory or 
enforceable regulation).79
There are several categories of Corporate Social Responsibility 
approaches including Progressive Corporate Law Theory, Global Corporate 
Citizenship Theory, Social Contract Theory, and Environmentalist Theory 
approaches. Corporate Social Responsibility approaches are an ­important 
part of the regulation of TNCs, in part because of the simultaneous over-
lapping regulatory jurisdictions, regulatory fragmentation, and promi-
nence of international human rights law in the agendas of international 
institutions and non-­governmental organizations. Some approaches, such 
as Progressive Corporate Law Theory and Social Contract Theory, apply 
to corporations generally, which includes TNCs. Others such as the Global 
Corporate Citizenship Theory and Environmentalist Theory approaches 
apply specifically to TNCs and corporations that are primarily domestic 
but engage in transnational economic activity.

Progressive Corporate Law
Progressive Corporate Law Theory can be classified as a sub-­category 
of Corporate Social Responsibility  approaches although some scholars 
may view it as an independent category. It developed as a Corporate 
Social Responsibility response to the Law and Economics Contractarian 
approach that was prominent in the 1980s.80 Progressive Corporate Law 
approaches gained traction in the late 1990s. Under Progressive Corporate 
Law approaches, the concentration and use of power by TNCs and other 
large corporations are core concerns, in addition to the moral and ethical 
obligations envisioned under a general Corporate Social Responsibility 
approach.81 Many argue that the large corporations, like TNCs, have char-
acteristics that distinguish them from mere ‘aggregations of private prop-
erty’, which justifies additional social responsibilities.82 Others go further 
and argue that the form, size and power of TNCs and other corporations 
demand operation in the public interest similar to a public institution.83 
Progressive Corporate Law approaches include mandatory legal require-
ments in addition to self-regulation, which is not a necessary characteristic 
of other forms of  Corprate Social Responsibility Theory approaches.84
Progressive Corporate Law approaches do not accept the shareholder 
primacy model as a given, but instead make it the subject of critique.85 
Some scholars using a Progressive Corporate Law approach apply commu-
nitarianism whereby they view and analyze TNCs as a community rather 
than as a ‘purely economic actor’.86 Another subset of scholars using a 
Progressive Corporate Law approach argue for a stakeholder model in 
which TNCs and other corporations owe legal responsibilities to their 
stakeholders, including employees, consumers and the communities in 
locations in which they operate.87

Global Corporate Citizenship / Social Contract
Global Corporate Citizenship approaches and Corporate Citizenship 
approaches developed out of business and management theory and 
draw on political science theory.88 Under Global Corporate Citizenship 
approaches, the rights and obligations of TNCs in society stem from the 
social contract that forms the basis of the relationship between a state 
and its citizens.89 This is based on an argument that TNCs owe their exist-
ence to the rights and benefits granted by states and, therefore, may be 
subject to any regulations states choose to impose on them within their 
prescriptive jurisdiction.90 As such, it is viewed as a voluntary relationship 
in which the TNC is bound to obey the law and to exercise its rights in 
light of other obligations that may be imposed by the state as part of that 
­relationship.91 Global Corporate Citizenship approaches require TNCs 
to act as stakeholders in society and to interact in an ethical manner with 
their stakeholders.92
Environmentalist Approaches
Environmentalist Theory approaches focus on TNCs’ obligations as they 
relate to the environment. A core tenant of Environmentalist Theory 
approaches is that economic growth should not be pursued at the cost 
of environmental protection and sustainability.93 Some Environmentalist

Global regulation of transnational corporations    ­53
Theory approaches build on the general Corporate Social Responsibility 
Theory argument that certain corporations, like TNCs, are similar to 
public institutions and, therefore, should be regulated as such. They argue 
that some corporations should be classified as public trusts and, there-
fore, subject to greater oversight under public-­trust regulations.94 This 
would apply to corporations that meet certain criteria, for example, based 
on public protection, grant of a monopoly, market capitalization, gross 
revenue and shareholders.95 Some scholars using Environmentalist Theory 
approaches have also suggested that TNCs might fit into this category.96
LAW AND ECONOMICS APPROACHES
Law and Economics Theory approaches draw heavily on economic theory, 
in particular neoclassical economic theory (supply-­side economics). Law 
and Economics approaches draw on property law, contract law, tort law 
and criminal law as sources of law.97 These approaches can be traced back 
to the 1960s and their popularity expanded significantly during the 1980s.98 
The goal of regulation informed by Law and Economics Theory is to allo-
cate and protect property rights and to enable the functioning of a market 
economy, both of which are generally viewed as short-­term goals.99 A func-
tioning market economy is seen as one that is efficient, whereby efficiency 
is defined as the allocation of rights to the parties who ‘would be willing to 
pay the most’ for them.100 Law and Economics Theory approaches are often 
used to address problems related to, for example, anti-­trust and securities.
Under Law and Economics Theory approaches, TNCs are viewed as

primarily or solely economic actors. Law and Economics approaches 
assume the general efficiency of laws and markets.101 They also assume that 
people are rational actors and responsive to incentives in a way that is pro-
portional to potential penalties.102 As a corollary, scholars using Law and 
Economics Theory preference market incentives over regulation and Law 
and Economics approaches focus on the allocation of rights and the use of 
incentives to influence behavior.103 Law and Economics scholars argue for 
limited government intervention, for example, limited to enabling regula-
tions or corrective regulations that simulate estimated market preferences.104 
In modern iterations of Law and Economics Theory, the Contractarian 
Theory of the firm is a core assumption. The Contractarian Theory 
approach is a sub-­category of the Law and Economics Theory approach 
and posits that TNCs are ‘private contractual arrangements’ among owners 
and managers that are governed primarily by market forces.105
Law and Economics Theory approaches focus on TNCs’ roles as 
economic actors, the role of markets, and the role of government in the 
market. Law and Economics scholars seek to address questions related 
to efficiency, competition, information asymmetries, distributional out-
comes, fairness, property rights, risk allocation, the extent to which 
government should intervene in markets, and the intersection of micro-­ 
and macro-­economics in the international context. Law and Economics 
Theory approaches tend to position regulation as a public intervention 
into a private sphere otherwise governed primarily by enabling laws.106 
Regulation is viewed as a market intervention, which requires a justifica-
tion to explain the need for and form of government intervention.
Law and Economics Theory approaches differ from other theoretical 
approaches in significant ways. Unlike Corporate Social Responsibility 
Theory approaches, Law and Economics Theory approaches generally limit 
ethical responsibilities of managers to shareholders and do not recognize 
moral and ethical responsibilities for stakeholders who are not sharehold-
ers such as employees, customers, and surrounding communities. From the 
persepctive of a Law and Economics Theory approach, profit maximiza-
tion for shareholders is paramount, and managers should only consider 
Corporate Social Responsibility ­measures if they contribute to the bottom 
line. Law and Economics Theory approaches tend to preference weak

enforcement with limited exceptions.107 Law and Economics approaches 
posit that law should be efficient.108
Scholars influenced by Law and Economics Theory approaches tend 
to view the goal of regulating TNCs as promoting economic efficiency in 
a system based on free market competition with secure property rights.109 
Some view the regulation of TNCs as a government intervention that is 
acceptable when needed to mitigate the effects of information asymmetry 
in the market or to promote social justice (often referred to as economic 
welfare in the economic literature).110
One critique of Law and Economics Theory approaches is that they 
assume that the common law system is efficient.111 These characteristics 
may limit the applicability of Law and Economics Theory approaches 
in the international context, which does not have a shared common law 
system (judge-­made law) and where many countries do not have a national 
common law system. Law and Economics Theory approaches have been 
critiqued from a Feminist Legal Theory perspective that argues that incor-
rect assumptions about equal bargaining power combined with a prefer-
ence for minimal regulation result in a lack of protection for people who 
are ‘economically vulnerable.’112 Another feminist critique is that the Law 
and Economics approaches apply ‘assumptions [that] protect the authority 
of those currently in power.’113
Differences in sub-­categories of Law and Economics approaches are 
often linked to the differences between the economic doctrines with which 
they are affiliated.114 There are several sub-­categories, including the Public 
Interest Theory,115 Regulatory Capture Theory, Shareholder Primacy 
Theory, Neo-­Keynesian Theory, and Innovation Economics Theory. The 
Public Interest Theory approach argues that, when regulations repair 
market failures due to inefficiency or unfair outcomes, ‘regulation increases

social welfare’.116 In contrast, the Regulatory Capture Theory approach 
sees regulation in the economy primarily as a response to pressure by 
­interest groups attempting to maximize profits for their members.117
Shareholder Primacy Theory
One of the dominant regulatory approaches today, the Shareholder 
Primacy Theory approach is a Corporate Governance approach.118 It is 
a response to the separation of ownership and control in the governance 
structure of TNCs, a characteristic of corporations that was the focus of 
theoretical debates in the 1930s.119 This supply-­side approach positions 
the producers of goods and services as the central players in the economy. 
However, the discussions about ownership and control in the 1930s did 
not lead directly or immediately to Shareholder Primacy as a theoretical 
approach.120
The dominant aproach to corporate governance was based on 
Managerialism Theory in the United States from the mid-­1930s until the 
1970s.121 This began to change as a governance model based on Shareholder 
Primacy Theory began to replace the one based on Managerialism and by 
the 1990s became the dominant theoretical approach to corporate regula-
tion in the United States.122 The model based on Shareholder Primacy 
Theory remains dominant in the United States and other countries 
although some scholars have begun to predict its decline.123

Neo-­Keynesian Theory
The Neo-­Keynesian Theory approach is a demand-­side economics 
approach and assumes that the demand for goods and services in the 
form of spending or investing by business, government, and consum-
ers is the primary driver of economic growth.124 As a corollary, scholars 
using ­Neo-­Keynesian Theory tend to prefer government regulations 
that promote economic growth via increased consumption as a result of 
­‘equitable distribution of income and wealth.’125
Innovation Economics Theory
The Innovation Economics Theory approach is a production-­efficiency 
orientation that assumes that innovation is the primary driver of growth.126 
As a corollary, the Innovation Economics Theory approach prioritizes 
regulation that benefits innovation even at the short-­term expense of 
profit maximization or equitable distribution of wealth.127 In addition, 
TNC regulation from an Innovation Economics Theory approach ‘would 
be more open to seeing the benefits of inter-­firm collaborative activity.’128
NEW GOVERNANCE THEORY APPROACHES
New Governance Theory approaches bring together core elements 
of Corporate Social Responsibility Theory and Law and Economics 
Theory approaches, and scholars have argued that New Governance 
Theory approaches merge corporate governance and Corporate Social 
Responsibility approaches.129 New Governance Theory approaches focus 
on the role of ‘[p]rivate forms of social regulation,’ often in the form of 
self-­regulation, operating in conjunction with state-­centered regulation.130

They are based on the assumption that states do not have the capacity to 
address the challenges presented by globalization and so, therefore, addi-
tional capacity is needed, which creates a need to involve non-­state actors 
in regulation.131 Scholars using New Governance Theory approaches study 
the regulations, the regulators and the institutional environments in which 
new governance emerges.132 New Governance Theory approaches assign 
the state a role in the promotion of ‘overall welfare and equity.’133 New 
Governance Theory approaches emerged in the 1990s.134
New Governance Theory approaches have been described as a ‘third 
way’ situated on a continuum between state-­centered regulation and market 
mechanisms.135 Their emergence is viewed as a response to the failure of 
domestic and international actors ‘to solve emerging problems.’136 Private 
regulatory regimes are ‘voluntary systems of rules developed, monitored, 
and enforced by non-­state actors.’137 Successful private regulatory regimes 
often have ‘a strong similarity to government regulation operated by 
­non-­state actors.’138
New Governance Theory approaches are often presented as ‘an alterna-
tive to command and control [theories of] regulation.’139 Scholars argue 
that New Governance Theory allows the development of more flexible and 
participatory legal remedies.140 There are many variations among scholars 
using New Governance Theory, but a common assumption is that a solely 
treaty-­based, top-­down model of global regulation has limitations that 
prevent it from fully addressing important challenges presented by modern 
globalization.141

Global regulation of transnational corporations    ­59
New Governance Theory approaches posit that private and self-­
regulation have been around for a long time and are more successful than 
state-­centered or market mechanisms in some circumstances.142 They 
straddle the line that previously was theorized as a clear and non-­porous 
boundary between legally enforceable ‘hard law’ and ‘soft law’ comprising 
aspirations and norms that are not legally enforceable.143 New Governance 
Theory approaches study the ‘features’ or potential effects of private and 
self-­regulation.144 Some scholars argue that the longevity of private regula-
tion is positively influenced by ‘(1) strong, preexisting norms, (2) industry 
actors with a competitive advantage in setting rules, and (3) a robust 
market for public and private regulation.’145 New Governance Theory 
approaches ‘identif[y] a growing involvement of the private sector in 
shaping public policy and regulation.’146
Some New Governance theories seek to identify the contexts in 
which private and self-­regulation emerges and flourishes.147 Some New 
Governance Theory scholars suggest that this approach may be par-
ticularly suited to address certain types of sector-­specific issues.148 For 
example, some scholars argue that private regulation tends to be more suc-
cessful in economic sectors in which there a small number of participants 
who are repeat players and who possess large amounts of information 
about other players.149 New Governance Theory approaches posit that par-
ticipants in a particular sector are often better suited to create ­regulations

because of their industry-­specific knowledge.150 Rather than promoting 
the injection or overlay of a comprehensive system, New Governance 
Theory approaches call for individual ‘building blocks’ to be developed 
and ­integrated into existing regulatory structures.151
In addition, New Governance Theory approaches posit that private-­ and 
self-­regulation are more effective when three factors that promote coopera-
tion are present.152 The first is that participants in the relevant economic 
sector value relationships (‘relationship preservation’).153 The second is that 
there is an incentive to unify against a perceived external pressure or threat 
(‘industry protection’).154 The third is that existing market participants 
have some preexisting form of common interaction (participation).155
Some scholars also posit that New Governance Theory approaches 
result in a regulatory structure that is situated between top-­down and 
bottom-­up approaches.156 Others posit that New Governance Theory can 
create a benefit in the form of a ‘market to regulate’ in which regulatory 
competition drives the creation of regulation where there was none or 
better regulation that would exist without competition.157
New Governance Theory approaches have been critiqued for a lack 
of examples proving the benefits and effectiveness of private or self-­
regulation158 and concerns that private or self-­regulation will reduce the 
probability that more rigorous and enforceable regulations will be ­enacted.159

New Governance approaches also have been criticized as ‘deregulation in 
disguise,’ but others counter that these approaches reject deregulation.160
From a New Governance Theory approach perspective, TNCs present 
a special area of need. The lack of state capacity to comprehensively regu-
late TNCs stems from several factors, including the limitations of solely 
domestic regulation and the lack of international regulation coupled with 
the lack of some form of respondeat superior for separately incorporated 
subsidiaries.161
CRITICAL LEGAL THEORY APPROACHES
Critical Legal Theory approaches call into question dominant theo-
retical doctrines and highlight ways that the claim to universality of these 
approaches is undermined by systemic exclusion and inequality. Critical 
Legal Theory approaches that have addressed issues in corporate law or 
the regulation of TNCs include Feminist Legal Theory, Critical Race 
Theory, and Third World Theory approaches.
Feminist Legal Theory
Feminist Legal Theory approaches incorporate insights from multiple 
disciplines, including ethics, morality and political science.162 Feminist 
Legal Theory approaches theorize gender and call into question assump-
tions of universality, objectivity and gender-­neutrality that are present in 
many disciplines, including corporate and international law.163 Feminist 
Legal Theory approaches focus on the ‘use and distribution of power’ 
and address issues related to social exclusion, vulnerability, and subordi-
nation.164 Feminist Legal Theory approaches to corporate law began to

Core goals of Feminist Legal Theory are to improve women’s lives and 
promote societal flourishing.166 The goal of Feminist Legal Theory as 
it relates to regulation of corporations is to identify potential points of 
intervention where women and others have unequal power or are systemi-
cally subordinated.167 Scholars using Feminist Legal Theory approaches 
have noted that TNC governance is often guided by assumptions of a 
gendered, specifically male, employee.168 Regulations that are informed 
by Feminist Legal Theory approaches are developed with an explicit 
awareness of the effects on women and ways that regulation can reduce 
or mitigate negative effects of corporate actions on women. Feminist 
Legal Theory approaches are often applied to analyze problems related to 
human rights and labor.
Feminist Legal Theory approaches view corporations as comprised of 
and affecting a community of individuals who are all equally valuable 
as people.169 Further, because they are equally valuable, their needs and 
interests should be given equal weight in corporate decision-­making at the 
macro level.170 In addition, valuing all community members’ needs equally 
means that equal weight should be given to effects on others in individual 
decision-­making.171 Scholars applying Feminist Legal Theory approaches 
have argued that the regulation of TNCs ‘should give transnational cor-
porations an incentive to balance economic goals with socio-­political 
goals.’172

Global regulation of transnational corporations    ­63
Core contributions of Feminist Legal Theory approaches include the 
feminist ethics of care and connectedness173 and the perspective that the 
‘personal is political.’174 The feminist ethic of care posits a fundamental 
equality that is based on a prioritization of ‘concern for others.’175 It 
presents an alternative set of criteria for decision-­making that addresses 
a hierarchy embedded in the formal structures of traditional corporate 
governance. The ‘personal is political’ highlights the importance of 
addressing systemic oppression rather than focusing on its effects on one 
individual.176
Key contributions of Feminist Legal Theory approaches to corpo-
rate law include: inclusion of non-­shareholder stakeholders in corporate 
decision-­making, incorporation of concepts of care and connection into 
fiduciary duty law, identification of disproportionate harmful effects 
on women, and overburdening of women as a result of negative effects 
of ­corporations.177 For example, scholars using Feminist Legal Theory 
approaches have argued that corporations should not prioritize profit max-
imization to the extent that it requires the externalization of risk to third 
parties because this violates the principles of care and connectedness.178
Feminist Legal Theory approaches posit that traditional theoretical 
approaches and the legal systems they justify are flawed if they assume 
neutrality and universality without incorporating an analysis of bias 
and inequality to determine whether these assumptions are accurate. 
Scholars using Feminist Legal Theory approaches have identified several 
potential areas of weakness in traditional approaches, including exclusion 
of women’s experiences from analyses of purportedly universal interna-
tional law,179 gender bias in facially neutral rules,180 omission of parties’ 
unequal bargaining power in transactions from economic models,181 and 
­theoretically inconsistent application of public–private distinctions that

appear to be based on gender bias.182 Some scholars writing from a 
Feminist Legal Theory perspective have questioned theories that assume 
the goal of ‘unlimited economic growth’ as a norm and argued instead for 
an approach that includes ‘the distribution of wealth and resources.’183
Critical Race Theory
Critical Race Theory approaches incorporate insights from multiple dis-
ciplines and emerged in the 1970s.184 Critical Race Theory approaches 
build on Critical Legal Studies and Radical Feminist Theory, as well as 
several others.185 In the context of TNCs, scholars using a Critical Race 
Theory approach theorize race, racism and power and call into question 
assumptions of law’s neutrality and objectivity. Scholars using a Critical 
Race Theory approach analyze issues related to oppression, privilege, 
­distribution of wealth and access to resources.
The core goal of Critical Race Theory approaches is to end all oppres-
sion.186 Critical Race Theory approaches posit that people who are on the 
receiving end of discrimination should inform public policy and law.187 
Further, some scholars who write from a Critical Race Theory perspec-
tive argue that markets should be restructured to function in ways that 
will result in procedural equality and substantive justice.188 Some scholars 
have made calls for the incorporation of Critical Race Theory approaches 
into analyses of international law, for example, through engagement with 
economic and social rights on the international stage, deconstruction 
of claims of universalism and equality in human rights law, analysis of 
extra-­governmental institutions such as TNCs that may negatively affect

human rights, and engagement with international enforcement bodies and 
mechanisms.189 Critical Race Theory approaches have been incorporated, 
although often not explicitly, into recent scholarship that addresses TNC 
regulation.
Third World Theory
Like other Critical Legal Theory approaches, Third World Theory incor-
porates insights from multiple disciplines, including history, political 
science, ethics and morality.190 Third World Theory approaches take the 
position that law, markets and politics are interconnected.191 They place 
an emphasis on substantive rights as opposed to formal or procedural 
rights.192 As a corollary, Third World Theory critiques approaches that 
assume the formal equality of states under international law as ignoring 
the interconnectedness of law, economics and politics as well as the biases 
inherent in the international legal system.193 Further, Third World Theory 
approaches argue that distinctions between public and private spheres are 
not relevant for addressing substantive issues, including ‘the scope, type 
and structure of private interests and power’ as well as the ‘redistribution 
of power among different social groups.’194

broader body of scholarship on Third World Approaches to International 
Law (TWAIL), which emerged in the 1950s.195 TWAIL emphasizes issues of 
‘morality, ethics, and justice’ and an understanding of the interconnected-
ness of disciplines as necessary for an accurate analysis.196 TWAIL scholars 
seek to analyze the role of international law in creating and maintaining 
a hierarchy of international norms and propose alternative structures for 
international governance.197 The stated goal of TWAIL scholarship is to 
­‘eradicate the conditions of underdevelopment in the Third World.’198 A 
unifying characteristic of TWAIL scholarship is the repudiation of claims 
that ­international law is universal.199
From a TWAIL perspective, international law is inherently problematic 
because of its role in the subordination of the Third World, ‘non-­European 
peoples and societies’ and most of the countries in the global south.200 
Some TWAIL scholars have argued that international law enables a hierar-
chy in which business and financial interests are treated as more important 
than people’s political, cultural, or social interests.201 For example, TWAIL 
scholars have critiqued international law for prioritizing the internation-
alization of property rights and the interests of transnational corpora-
tions while neglecting to establish corresponding transnational democratic 
structures and ‘systems of representation and accountability.’202
Third World Theory approaches tend to view international law making 
through a decentralized lens that envisions a significant role for non-­state 
actors. 203 They advocate for legal reform to promote regulation to protect 
and promote substantive rights and equity.204 Some scholars writing from a 
Third World Theory approach identify a ‘new imperialism’ and argue that 
TNCs are one of four groups ‘that primarily shape the current pattern of

economic and legal globalization.’205 In this context, some scholars using a 
Third World Theory approach have argued that non-­state actors, specifi-
cally ‘an emerging transnationalist capitalist class . . ., which includes TNC 
executives and local affiliates, are shaping the regulation of TNCs.’206
Third World Theory approaches have been critiqued for a perceived lack 
of ‘a wholistic critique’ or normative proposals.207 In response to this cri-
tique, some TWAIL scholars have proposed the redefinition of sovereignty 
to more fully incorporate concepts of peoples’ soverign rights to expand 
the governance role of local communities in addition to, for example, the 
‘ruling elite.’208
Several different theoretical approaches have had varying levels of 
influence on Third World Theory approaches, including African, Maoist, 
Marxist, post-­colonial and Soviet approaches.209
RELIGIOUS APPROACHES
Many religions provide guidance regarding the nature, purpose, rights 
and responsibilities of corporations. As mentioned above, religious 
approaches to business regulation predate the emergence of TNCs as a 
business form. However, they include guidance that can and has been 
applied to TNCs. Most of the scholarship on religious approaches 
to TNCs focuses on Christian and Jewish approaches.210 A smaller

­proportion of this body of scholarship focuses on Islamic approaches.211 
Islamic approaches tend to be an application of Sharī’ah law values, 
while Christian and Jewish approaches also provide more specific guid-
ance.212 In addition to the guidance provided by individual religions, the 
1993 Interfaith Declaration also provides a multi-­faith approach to cor-
porate conduct.213 Religious approaches view the environment as God-­
created and, therefore, often have specific guidelines related to conduct 
that affects the environment that stem from this perspective.214 Although 
religious approaches are first and foremost intended to apply to members 
of that religion or actors in a market that is governed by the principles 
of that religion, the lines are permeable and have relevance beyond those 
bounds.
Jewish Approach
Many religious scholars argue that under Jewish law corporations, 
including TNCs, should not be permitted to be legal persons because 
they are ‘artificial persons.’215 Jewish law differentiates between ‘natural 
persons’ and ‘artificial persons.’216 Jewish law only allows natural persons 
to have legal status.217 Instead of granting TNCs and other corporations 
legal person status, the most common approach under Jewish law is to

view corporations as limited partnerships rather than a separate legal 
entity.218
Perspectives on TNCs under Jewish law make it possible to place 
expectations of moral and ethical conduct on the human partners who 
formed the corporation.219 Rather than governing TNCs directly under 
Jewish law, TNCs’ conduct is influenced from within by governing the 
individuals connected with the corporation, for example, the sharehold-
ers, directors, managers, and employees.220 In addition, Jewish law exer-
cises external influences on TNCs’ conduct by ‘authorizing and requiring 
communally imposed regulation.’221 Jewish law (Dina de-­Malkhuta Dina) 
preferences certain requirements under secular law when they require 
socially responsible behavior instead of profit maximization.222 Jewish 
law also requires corporate conduct to be in accordance with ‘established 
commercial customs’ (Minhag ha-­Soharim) and investors are assumed 
to have notice of relevant customs and to have given implicit consent.223 
Jewish law categorizes the theory of caveat emptor (buyer beware) as 
unacceptable.224
Catholic Approaches
The Catholic Social Doctrine sets out the common good as a core value 
that ‘involves recognition and advancement of the universal dignity of the 
human person.’225 This sets limits on the pursuit of economic interests by 
placing them lower in priority than the ‘promotion of human dignity.’226 
Catholic Social Doctrine prioritizes the promotion of the common good 
and articulates the view that ‘businesses should be ­characterized by their 
capacity to serve the common good of society.’227
Corporations, including TNCs, are viewed as a community in which

participants have obligations to each other and are evaluated based on 
their effects on human dignity and the societal community as a whole.228 
Contributing to the common good includes producing ‘useful goods and 
services’ and ‘creating opportunities for meeting, cooperating, and the 
enhancement [of] the abilities of the people involved.’229 More specifi-
cally, this means ‘the active sharing of all in the administration and profits 
of these enterprises . . . is to be promoted.’230 Catholic approaches view 
private property as permanently encumbered by a ‘social mortgage,’ which 
means that even private property has an intrinsically social function.231
Catholic Social Teaching envisions limitations on economic competition 
to prevent the fraud and injustice that the Catholic approach expects would 
result from ‘excessive focus on profits and competition.’232 Profit maximi-
zation has been specifically critiqued from the perspective of the Catholic 
approach as undermining the common good.233 Catholic Social Teaching 
expressly articulates the need for government regulation to encourage pro-
motion of the common good and inhibit profit ­maximization and worker 
exploitation.234

Islamic Approaches
Islamic approaches are based on an assumption that there is an inherent 
integration of the public and private spheres because they are that way 
in the eyes of God.235 This promotes a ‘relatively holistic approach’ to 
TNC regulation.236 The theoretical framework provided by Sharī’ah law is 
believed to be static although flexibility in application is allowed.237 Sharī’ah 
law views property rights as inherently paired with ‘rules and ethical 
codes designed to protect the rights of society.’238 Islamic approaches 
seem to reflect a stakeholder rather than a shareholder model of TNC 
regulation.239 Islamic stakeholder models position the stakeholder-­state as 
responsible for ­providing regulations and enforcement.240
The concept of vicegerency (khalifah) in Sharī’ah law positions TNCs 
and other businesses as groups of people who are agents responsible 
for management of both the shareholder’s and society’s economic 
resources.241 Sharī’ah law includes formal law as well as norms and 
customs.242 Sharī’ah law has three main components: belief and faith 
(‘aqīdah), morality and ethics (akhlāq) and legal rules (fiqh) – all of 
which provide guidance regarding the operation of TNCs. This theory 
of trusteeship (amanah) requires managers to act ‘in the best interests of 
owners’ but does not permit profit-­maximization ‘at the expense of other 
stakeholders.’243

Sharī’ah law views God as ‘the ultimate owner of all . . . resources.’244 
The relationship with God is viewed as a divine contract that also 
determines how corporate agents interact with others.245 The corol-
lary to this assumption is ‘the belief that a company should be socially 
responsible regardless of the financial consequences.’246 This includes 
‘how the firm treats its employees, whether or not it uses its resources 
in an ­environmentally sound way, and whether or not its products 
really make life better for those who use them.’247 From the perspec-
tive of Islamic approaches, it would be contradictory to separate social 
responsibility from the role of the corporation.248 This requirement 
for a God-­conscious (taqwā) approach incorporates human dignity, 
free will,  equality and  rights, and trust and responsibility into this 
framework.249
Islamic law forbids profit making by certain means, including ‘interest, 
bribery, gambling and games of chance, speculation, short weighing and 
short measuring and business negligence’ as well as through practices that 
are illegal or unfair.250 For example, Islamic approaches categorize the 
theory of caveat emptor (buyer beware) as unacceptable.251
CONCLUSION
In the decades since the first theory of TNCs was proposed, theoretical 
approaches for their regulation have grown into a multifaceted although 
incomplete set of theories with which to analyze who, when, why, how, 
with what effects and for whom TNCs can or should be regulated. 
This chapter identified six schools of thought: International Legal 
Theory, Corporate Social Responsibility Theory, Law and Economics 
Theory, New Governance Theory, Critical Legal Theory, and Law and 
Religion approaches. There are other ways to classify these approaches 
and this is not intended to be a comprehensive or definitive list of all 
approaches.

Global regulation of transnational corporations    ­73
This is a rapidly developing field of scholarship that is still in flux. The 
theoretical approaches discussed as part of these six schools of thought 
are not necessarily all compatible and they are not all necessarily ­mutually 
exclusive. In some cases, taking a comparative approach may reveal gaps or 
weaknesses in approaches that can be easily mitigated. In others it may call 
into question foundational assumptions. In still other cases, a compara-
tive approach may reveal value differences that are difficult to reconcile. 
Table 2.1 gives an overview of the disciplines used, underlying assump-
tions, ­theoretical approaches to sources of law, key actors and goals of 
regulation.
As a body, these six schools of thought have the potential to inform 
the regulation of markets and market structures as well as the conduct of 
TNCs as well as actors in and with TNCs. They could shape the structure 
of markets (structural regulation) and the behavior of actors within those 
markets (conduct regulation). They could be used to explain and evaluate 
the effects of regulation and help project which regulations may be most 
appropriate for a specific context and goal.
Taken individually, each of these six schools of thought may only par-
tially be able to explain or inform global regulation as it relates to TNCs’ 
unique characteristics and the challenges and opportunities associated 
with TNCs. It may require the explanatory power of several or all of 
the theoretical approaches discussed above to develop a global regula-
tory structure that can manage entities with the size, form, influence, 
public–private character, and multi-­jurisdictional nature of TNCs. It 
seems unlikely that one approach alone will have the explanatory power 
to inform global regulation that makes the most of the opportunities and 
overcomes the challenges associated with TNCs. As theoretical approaches 
continue to develop and expand, they may need to more clearly identify 
spheres of applicability or points of complimentarity. Either individually 
or in conjunction with some or all of the other approaches, these schools 
of thought have the potential to inform global regulation that targets or 
prioritizes one or more legal, economic or social policy objectives. These 
could include, for example, TNCs’ regulatory compliance or arbitrage, 
beneficial or exploitative working conditions, promotion or suppression 
of market competition and wealth generation, environmental harm or 
protection and employees’ and their dependents’ physical safety and 
welfare.
From the perspective of world history, this is still a young field. It is 
also a very important but under-­researched, although expanding, area 
of legal theory. There is still considerable room for ambitious scholars 
to shape the theories and to design the theoretical frameworks that will 
define global regulation of TNCs for years to come. There are many gaps,

TNCs and political actors and governments3.  The evolving relationship between TNCs 
and political actors and governments
Larry Catá Backer1
INTRODUCTION
This chapter examines one of the most interesting, and most elusive, 
areas of transnational corporations (TNC) regulation, and ­operation – 
the evolving relationships among the great stakeholders of TNC gov-
ernance: political actors and governments. It is a dynamic and political 
topic, built on the slippery foundation of shifting definitions and 
agendas that has marked the lurch from the 1970s state-­based inter-
nationalism2 to the modern polycentric governance logics of economic 
globalization,3 though one that still exhibits a substantial amount of 
national characteristics.4
The dynamic element of these relationships can serve as a conceptual 
starting point. At the start of the third quarter of the last century, the 
issue of any relationship among TNCs, political actors and government 
might have occupied very little conceptual space. For the most part, TNCs 
and non-­governmental organizations (NGOs) tended to focus their inter-
actions through the state, and politics. Direct popular mobilizations were 
just starting in the most developed states – the lettuce (and then grape) 
boycott led by Cesar Chavez, among the most remarkable and culturally 
important at the time5 – but even these were centered around politics and

law.6 The same appeared true in the evolution of popular mobilization in 
developing states.7 At the same time the political power of large global 
enterprises was being exposed in ways that suggested the extent of their 
power to affect the domestic political and legal orders of developing 
states.8
By the first decades of the 21st century, states appeared to have retreated 
from either a leading or centering role in the organization of relationships 
among non-­state actors, governments and TNCs.9 For the most part, 
states retreated because they were unable or unwilling to change even as 
economic globalization grounded in the increasing porousness of borders 
globalized politics and the operations of economic and political actors, 
producing governance gaps within which domestic legal orders could not 
reach and within which multi-­state harmonization proved difficult.10 The 
new center of state or public intervention appeared to have moved upward 
to international organizations, and then downward into some states (when 
willing) or outward into the non-­state sector.11 But public intervention no 
longer monopolized all governance space. Into the void, new transnational 
systems of self-­referencing relationships suggested themselves12 as critical 
actors realigned their relationships to create a new regulatory space within 
which each played a new and important role.13 Where states once always set 
the structure of debate and served as the arbiter of rules, TNCs and NGOs 
began to amplify relationships that became at once both cooperative and 
adversarial and where they appeared to embrace both monitoring and rule

making objectives.14 And both were increasingly seen as political actors in 
both transnational and national space, no longer merely objects of state 
control but now also partners in governance.15
Within the emerging political space created through the realignments of 
power brought by economic globalization, TNCs, NGOs, states and public 
international organizations have developed a political ecology grounded 
in their inter-­relationships that drives a dynamic political process beyond 
the state. The interactions of these actors suggest the richness of the 
ecology of TNC relationships with governments and NGOs, one in which 
each of the actors are sometimes locked in a series of adverse or coopera-
tive relationships, and sometimes simultaneously in both. The object of 
the relationship is accountability on one side and risk management on 
the other.16 The ideology of this ecology is not fixed and ranges from the 
notion that each of these actors must remain adverse if the ‘system’ is 
to produce welfare maximizing results, to notions that deep networks of 
collective action produce comprehensive systemic coherence.17 Moreover, 
the role of each actor within this ecology also remains contested. The 
overall ideological framework within which these relations are framed 
also colors the view of these relationships. Three principal ­variations have 
proven of enduring importance as conceptual blinders which frame much 
of the academic, policy and political discourse: neoliberal, statist and 
­production chain.18
Actors and ecology in motion suggest the spatial element of the relation-
ships among the principal actors. But the temporal element is important as

well. The 1970s, the apex of state ideology, focused on domestic regulation. 
From the 1980s through the turn of the century was an age of deregula-
tion and competition among states for positions within global production 
chains. This retreat from the normative project of regulation was filled 
by NGOs and international organizations, and to some extent by TNCs 
themselves, in multiple and complex systems that have come to domi-
nate relations among these actors.19 And indeed, this century is marked 
by a relationship between TNCs and political actors that underlines the 
extent to which TNCs now view as important the normative legitimacy of 
NGOs,20 and to which NGOs view TNCs as sources and objects of govern-
ance power.21 But it is marked by something else, especially outside of the 
Anglo-­American world – the emergence of an increasingly influential view 
that TNCs, like state organs, have an obligation to realize social norms 
through their own operations.22 In other words, that enterprises (and 
perhaps other political actors – governments and NGOs) have an obliga-
tion to act only in ways that are supportive of social norms.23 Whether 
social norms might best be enforced through law remains highly contested.
This chapter, then, considers the nature of the relationships among 
TNCs, political actors and government, as a set of emerging ecologies 
of political economy. Each represents a distinct response to the trans-
formation of the global legal, economic and political order in the face of 
­globalization. Each exists autonomously and is evolving simultaneously, yet 
each is significantly interconnected within a polycentric governance order 
that lends overall structure without a centering position. The chapter starts 
with the conventional and traditional ecology of relationships, centered 
on the state. It then considers the three most distinctive forms of emerg-
ing relational ecologies that de-­center the state. The first is based on the 
TNC as the centering element of the production chain order. The second

is grounded on the emergence of non-­state governance centers which assert 
order through certification, verification, and monitoring. The third posits 
the emergence of a multi-­stakeholder autonomous and self-­referencing 
system around production chains. The chapter briefly considers whether 
there is something like meta theory useful for the ­understanding of these 
otherwise disaggregated and scattered but intermeshed systems that have 
arisen around the state. The chapter ends with a brief suggestion of what 
may lie ahead.
THE CONVENTIONAL ECOLOGY
The conventional ecology is built on a set of established premises that them-
selves are embedded in an ideology of politics that is still quite ­powerful. 
The starting point for any analysis of the TNC is society – whether to defend 
it or to seek to transform it into something more suited to the taste of the 
commentator or the institutions she may represent. This section considers 
first the ideologies around which relationships among TNCs, political and 
public actors are understood or theorized, and then the premises about the 
character of each of the principal actors. It then briefly describes the result-
ing ecology within which their interactions necessarily occur, ­constrained 
by the choice of disciplining ideology and premises.
Westphalian Equality
The ideology around which relationships can be understood and con-
structed is based on certain fundamental notions of the state and the state 
system. Three principal approaches emerged by the last quarter of the 
20th century, and all three are still with us.24 The first is the most influen-
tial and describes the conceptual structure of contemporary globalization 
within or through the state system.25 It posits a strong state system based 
on formal equality between states and the grounding notions that states 
are principally responsible for the creation of order and control within 
their territories, and that such order and control is exercised through the 
domestic legal order as interpreted by courts and enforced through the

state’s police power. But that internal control is balanced by the embrace 
of a global consensus on which norms are expected to be domesticated 
in states through law. Economic globalization represents one aspect of 
part of this system. States remain the central element of rule-­making and 
enforcement, which are crafted in ways that are sensitive to local condi-
tions, customs and tastes, but the basic principles from which rules are 
derived are developed elsewhere. This ‘elsewhere’ has been institutionalized 
within the organs of public and private international organizations – from 
regional human rights organizations to private standard-­setting bodies.
This ideology produces systems of governance, justified on increasingly 
universal or absolute terms. This convergence then brings together the 
state, political actors and business in relationships shaped by an increased 
ability to participate in the development and implementation of the con-
sensus norms around which state duty is understood. The internationali-
zation of norm making, and the emergence of international organization 
within which these norms are made, creates a space for global private 
actors to participate. And that space then suggests the character of the 
relationships among states, civil society and business – at once cooperative 
and adversarial as they seek to influence the tone and direction of global 
consensus on norms, and thus on law-­making in states, and behavior rules 
in the societal sphere.
Systemic autonomy through convergence also tends to provide a basis for the 
autonomy of non-­state actors, critical to the implementation of global systems 
of private activity. Rules governing merchants, for example, have become 
more independent from the commercial rules of particular states, especially 
with respect to transactions that cross borders.26 Corporations that own 
themselves,27 markets that are self-­regulating within the bounds of transna-
tional rules,28 and non-­state actors free of the constraints of regulation by a 
particular nation-­state become more common and important.29

This suggests that at its limits, these ideological foundations make 
­plausible the notion that as the international systems become more 
­developed and autonomous, the power relationships between states and 
international norm-­making organizations will be reversed. ‘The primary 
function of management of the traditional public realm . . . has gradually 
come to be . . . the maintaining of the conditions required for the well-­
being of the economy, including, above all, the legal conditions.’30 As a 
consequence, the nature of the relationship among TNCs, state and politi-
cal actors becomes political and economic, and the focus of that relation-
ship is both on norm making and on influencing the political cultures that 
in turn influence the behavior of states and TNCs.
The ‘official line’ of many of the most developed states and of the 
­international organization, global political actors and TNCs tends to 
revolve around variations of this liberal market and internationalizing 
political-­economic ideology. It reaffirms the notion of horizontal equality 
among states and their central role in managing law systems, it interna-
tionalizes norm making through inter-­governmental organizations which 
then provide an international platform within which TNCs and political 
actors can interact to produce both norms and cultural consensus which 
are then domesticated through further interactions among governments, 
political actors and TNCs. But this official line is contested by other 
actors.
Economic Globalization
The second ideological framework around which relationships among 
TNCs, political and public actors are understood or theorized considers 
the relationships built around economic globalization. It sees in these 
relationships both the affirmance and transformation of the current state 
system in which TNCs and global civil society are complicit.
Under this second view, the current system of globalization repre-
sents the culmination of the Westphalian state system of global govern-
ance, and globalization does not threaten that system of state-­centered

function of management of the traditional public realm, where social power is 
exercised exclusively in the public interest, has gradually come to be, not the 
service of some common interest of well-­being conceived in terms of general values 
(say, justice or solidarity or happiness or human flourishing), but the maintaining 
of the conditions required for the well-­being of the economy, including, above all, 
the legal conditions.’

governance. Globalization, however, draws into sharper relief a natural 
distinction among nation-­states. One group is made up of politically 
powerful and economically developed states. The other group consists of 
all other states. Globalization and legal internationalism serve as a cover 
through which the group of powerful states may project their power into 
the second group of states, which assume a role of legal and economic 
dependence. International organizations leverage state power and provide 
a veil of ­legitimacy – based on the premises of state equality and national 
­sovereignty – for creating the sort of norm harmonizing consensus that is 
at the heart of liberal-­markets based globalization.
The object is to use law and norm in the service of the interests of 
the more powerful states, especially to control resources and markets. 
To that end, the more powerful states will use a variety of indirect tech-
niques of domination.31 States may use agents for this purpose, includ-
ing TNCs,32 and NGOs, transnational private voluntary regulatory 
­authorities, standard-­setting bodies and the like. Under this ideological 
view, TNCs and private political organizations should be presumed to 
serve the interests of the states from which they originate or to which 
they owe allegiance. And it might follow that, to some extent, the dif-
fering agendas pursued by TNCs and political organizations reflect 
their efforts to influence the political and societal cultures of the most 
powerful states, which will then internationalize those norms and drive 
them down into similarly powerful states. The great battles to inter­
nationalize the US Alien Tort Claims Act and to use US courts to apply 
an inter­nationalized version of US law provide an important case in 
point. Other areas of extra-­territorial application of state rules have 
been suggested as necessary to solve transnational problems, which both

internationalize and project the governing ideologies and interests of the 
most powerful states and their TNCs and civil society organizations.33 
The insight here is that (1) in contrast to the consensus liberal-­market 
ideology, globalization serves the interests of states and (2) that powerful 
states, TNCs and globalized civil society tend to align in their relation-
ships to create and impose norms and behavior structures downward 
through power-­production chains. Just as the more powerful states assert 
power and influence over less powerful and less-­developed states, so the 
largest TNCs and global civil society organizations tend to dominate the 
discourse within their respective spheres, and to serve the socio-­cultural 
(and therefore) political agendas of the states from which they originate. 
In this version, the international system does not lose its focus on the 
political or on the importance of political communities, but it is more 
nakedly hierarchical and the hand and dynamics of state power are more 
apparent. Within these ideological presumptions, TNCs, political actors 
and governments build relationships that are based on state power and 
private power hierarchies, and though they may have adverse inter-
ests, the interests of the most powerful states, TNCs and civil society 
organs will tend to align against the interests of less-­powerful business 
­enterprises, civil society and states.
Rule by Production Chain
The third structuring framework is a darker version of the second. It 
starts with the assumption that globalization is a necessary element in the 
sustainability of the power and wealth of the richest and most developed 
states. But in this variation, globalization represents a new form of impe-
rium, one not grounded in the acquisition and control of territory, but 
rather in the acquisition and control of production chains. It starts from 
the fundamental premise that globalization is necessary as the principal 
means through which the otherwise unsustainable wealth production of 
the most powerful states, led by a single great hegemon is sustained.34 In 
other words, the state system tends toward imperium, and the economic 
system can only be preserved by institutionalizing a production chain in 
which the poorest states and enterprises subsidize the consumption of the

wealthiest states. And thus the object of globalization – to institutionalize 
an efficient system designed to transfer the real costs of production from 
consumers in the richest states to those in the states in which overproduc-
tion occurs.
In effect, globalization masks an effective objective – convert the 
entire public sphere into a vast sphere of private activity – and a politi-
cal objective that speaks of new forms of neocolonialism, to transform 
all nation-­states into private property. If globalization transforms the 
state system into a special trade zone that benefits the hegemon and its 
allies, then all domestic production is to be eliminated in favor of an 
export model grounded in production specialization and overproduction. 
Production specialization eliminates state control over its labor markets. 
Overproduction amplifies the effects of production or labor specializa-
tion and is tied to cultures of consumerism. Universalizing cultures of 
consumption traps participants in the lower levels of production chains in 
their own subordination. The model produces a strong global zone under 
the control of the hegemon but otherwise produces state failure, which 
is to be ameliorated through charity (the loan regimes of international 
financial institutions), privatization and socialization. These are to be 
addressed not just by states but by efforts, coordinated or not, of TNCs 
and global civil society.
This ideological framework views TNCs, NGOs and other political 
actors, as serving the needs of the dominant states – as expressions of 
political authority manifested in economic activity. Within this ideologi-
cal structure TNCs merge with the states whose interests they necessar-
ily represent, and whose privileges are to be protected by states. To that 
effect international organizations – like the Organisation for Economic 
Co-­operation and Development (OECD) and international financial 
institutions – are meant to leverage the power of developed states by 
internationalizing the system of control that serves their interests. And 
those interests do not just further hegemonic power but are the neces-
sary elements to the stability of a system that is built on exploitation 
rather than on transactions for mutual benefits. Within this ideology, as 
well, TNCs serve states, and NGOs either serve to soften the inevitable 
exploitation at the heart of the global production process or might be 
fashioned into sites of resistance. States whose territories serve as the 
location of lower levels of production chains are bent to the interests of 
global production chains and the TNCs and social forces through which 
it is managed and made ­palatable. This is the conceptual foundation of 
developing states and of those societal forces, some of them globalized, 
that seek to oppose the dominant ideological foundation disparagingly 
referenced as the Washington Consensus or neoliberalism to suggest

the United States.35
From Structuring Framework to Perceptions of Ecology
If ideology provides the lens through which societal forces see and 
­understand ‘facts’ and relationships; that is, if these ideologies provide the 
interpretive premises around which relationships among TNCs, political 
and public actors are understood or theorized, then the premises about 
the character of each of the principal actors can also only be understood 
as a function of the ideological lens through which they are identified. 
Still, there are sets of core characteristics that are supra-­ideological and 
which are embedded in each of these approaches to the construction of the 
character of the inter-­relations among these actors. Ideology, then, drives 
the premises that serve as a working organization of relationships among 
governments, political actors and TNCs by structuring the character, 
objectives and conception of each of these actors.
The first touches on the state. For the most part, the conventional ecology 
places the state at the apex of societal, economic, political (but not neces-
sarily religious) spheres. It adheres to the premise that all states are equal 
and assert internal authority to the same extent. The state has a monopoly 
on law, which is assumed to be the most legitimate form of govern-
ance, authenticated by rule-­of-­law systems and the democratic processes 
through which law is produced and the state is operated. Both TNCs and 
NGOs look to the state to develop policy and norms, to enact laws on the 
basis thereof. Relations, thus, tend to be understood as a function of the 
role of the state in translating normative values to legal norms. Beyond 
that, all three stakeholders might be understood as working at aspects of 
mass mobilization. The object, again, is grounded on the premise of state 
centrality – managing popular opinion creates necessary leverage for effec-
tuating legal change. The societal sphere is vibrant but, again, also based 
on developing a culture in which law is normalized through socialization. 
States also control those techniques of monitoring and assessment that 
drive behaviour, and both TNCs and NGOs shape their relationship to 
affect the aggregate of these techniques.
But states are also actors within the transnational sphere. As actors 
within international organizations they also serve as a centering element 
of the work of these organizations. The conventional ecology makes it

self-­evident that, as the UN Guiding Principles suggest, the state leverages 
national power through multilateral efforts, and that normative harmoni-
zation is the most advantageous road towards the closing of ­governance 
gaps that have been the greatest cause of the loss of national sovereignty 
in the face of global economic activity. To that end, states align within 
international organizations to enhance their collective influence, both 
on the crafting of internationalized norms and in the projection of 
those norms into all other states. Organizations like the OECD provide 
a clear example of the way that international organizations seek to set 
the agenda for policy through active engagement with non-­members.36 
The World Bank and International Monetary Fund’s engagement with 
developing states provides another example. In these cases, ideology 
provides the lenses through which these relationships are understood. 
Under the liberal market model they are understood as the leading edge 
of development and consensus that is socialized through consent-­based 
imperatives of markets. Under the state dominance ­­ideology, these are 
seen as instruments of the most developed states to ensure their domi-
nance, the projection of their policies and interests through dominated 
international organizations, and the exploitative state ideology. To these 
distinct ends, both TNCs and civil society serve as instruments of the 
states from which they originate and from out of which their funds derive 
and supporters reside.
The second touches on the TNC. For the most part, the conventional 
ecology posited relationships with corporations or similar aggregations 
of capital, regulated and chartered by states or their political subdivisions. 
The issue traditionally centered on the theory of the corporation and 
its effect on the regulatory relationship between corporation and state.37 
And it centers on the culture of the business enterprise.38 The question 
turned on the way that the distinct characteristics of the corporation 
operating beyond the sphere of national corporations could or ought to 
be regulated.39

To that end, a distinction was made between the process of produc-
tion and the institutionalization of capital. The production process was 
viewed as either a transnational matter for international organizations to 
manage or a core function of the societal sphere. The institutionalization 
of capital was viewed as inherently national and political, touching on 
the structures through which national macroeconomic policies were to be 
reified and thus more jealously guarded as an aspect of state sovereignty. 
Process ­management issues became centered in the work of the OECD – 
the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, for example – and articulated 
through the imposition of societal norms crafted through public interna-
tional organs and managed through non-­binding facilitation by states. 
The same might be said of the UN Guiding Principles for Business and 
Human Rights within global regulatory networks. Institutional manage-
ment was characterized as a function of corporate governance or as the 
subject of treaty – usually clusters of international agreements – bilateral 
and multilateral investment, commerce and friendship treaties, regional 
trade associations and the architecture of the World Trade Organization. 
Both process and institutionalized capital might also be affected by the 
policies and loan conditions of the great international financial institu-
tions, whose conditional lending clauses, along with their socialization 
programs ­(technical assistance) would serve as sites within which TNCs, 
states and NGOs might negotiate norms then applied through loan work 
and its ­collateral structures.
These splits among process and institutionalization, between national 
and international organs, also tended to destabilize any consensus on the 
definition of TNCs themselves. That, in turn, has an important effect on 
the character of relations among TNCs, governments and civil society 
actors. If a TNC is understood in classical terms,40 then one approaches 
the issues of relationship from the assumption that the TNC is a unitary 
actor and speaks with substantially one voice and out of the head office. 
One centers analysis, then, on issues of ownership and control rela-
tionships.41 This is a view quite compatible with the three ideological 
frameworks, although each then approaches the consequences of this 
assumption of the ­character of TNCs in different ways. It constitutes the 
TNC either as an autonomous actor in markets or as an instrument of 
states either to advance state policy or as the mechanism for hegemonic

sovereigns to exploit weaker states. And that, of course, changes the char-
acter of the relationship and interactions among TNCs and civil society 
and governments. But additionally, the ideological starting points also 
point to conceptual possibilities. TNCs are more likely to be understood 
as national enterprises with foreign operations under the state and exploit-
ative ideologies than under the liberal markets ideology or as integrated 
management and control systems, like states. For governments and civil 
society, then, the object is to establish relationships with the controlling 
or managing center. And there is a draft toward the notion, inherently 
institutional in nature, that these organisms may be controlled by and 
through national law as factors in the production of national macro-
economic policy. The possibilities of diffuse organization – of networks 
and arrangements grounded in coordinated linkages – requires viewing 
TNCs as characterized by a process element – becomes harder to concep-
tualize within regimes organized around the premise of TNCs as inher-
ently ­institutionalizations of capital.
Yet if a TNC is considered in process terms, as embedded within and a 
part of the processes of production to which it is directed, a very different 
set of relational consequences follow. Here the TNC cannot be understood 
as speaking with one voice – though all voices may sometimes speak in 
unison. The OECD definition provides a nice expression of this diffused 
model.42 This idea of a TNC is more compatible with liberal-­markets 
­ideology and permits the expression of TNCs as processes that are market-­
based and subject to a diffused and multi-­layered governance structure, 
both legal and societal. To some extent, this view is not anarchical in the 
sense that it supposes a centering element in the linked and coordinated 
systems that compromise a TNC enterprise. Yet a center does not suggest 
the sort of single point relationships that more classical definitions suggest. 
Rather, it fractures the TNC in terms of its engagement in relationships 
and opens the likelihood that such relationships will exist, with varying 
degrees of power and influence, at every level of the operation of the enter-
prise and among different actors. A process approach suggests that just 
as state power has fractured within regimes of economic ­globalization, so 
has the organizational unity of TNCs – at least with respect to its relations 
with civil society and states along its production chain.
The third touches on the NGO. Organized political actors represent 
both a transformation of mass politics and its internationalization from 
the last half of the 20th century – at least in its contemporary manifest­
ation. The business of mass mobilization is organized along functional

lines, each organization representing a functionally distinct aggregation 
of like-­minded individuals which have come together to advance their 
objectives, and for that purpose have developed an institutional organism 
that is self-­referencing and autonomous. In a sense, civil society organs 
have begun to take on the characteristics of their coordinate partners in 
global norm making – states and TNCs. They also suffer the same chal-
lenges – their representational qualities, legitimacy, democratic deficits 
and authority.43
NGOs serve as a means to aggregate individual voices, performing 
mass mobilization in three distinct areas. First NGOs relate to both states 
and TNCs in the production of normative values. Like states and TNCs, 
they seek to influence or perhaps dominate the discourse through which 
policy is formulated. But they also seek to influence and form the par-
ticular policies and normative values of TNCs, especially in areas with 
governance gaps. Second, NGOs serve a source of expertise within their 
own area of specialization. To that end they augment the legitimacy of 
claims to influence in norm making. Third, NGOs serve a monitoring and 
enforcement function, often substituting for the state where state organs 
are less well developed or funded. NGOs provide the modern mechanism 
for organizing mass interests and for privatizing the executive function 
once reserved to the state. These are the organizations that hold states and 
TNCs accountable for compliance with their own policies and promises, as 
well as those organizations that advocate changes in the policies of both. 
They also seek to represent the masses whose interests they serve, at least in 
a narrow sense. It is to that end that civil society’s relationship with TNCs 
and the state is often adversarial – even as they cooperate with both in the 
formulation of policy and its enactment as governance or law.44
Within the governance and policy spaces now opened in transnational 
space – that area of activity beyond the ability of any state to fully control 
and into which TNCs, international public and private organizations have 
entered to fill the void, NGO participation has become institutionalized, 
especially in the context of their formal relationships with governments 
(including international public organizations) and TNCs. The UN defines 
civil society as the ‘third sector’ of society, comprised of civil society and 
non-­governmental organizations. According to the UN, partnerships

with civil society advance its ideals.45 Moreover, the UN Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), in its Handbook for 
Civil Society, states that civil society actors ‘share information; advocate 
and scrutinize implementation of human rights; report violations, assist 
victims of abuses; and campaign for the development of new human rights 
standards.’46 The Handbook further recognizes that civil society actors are 
those ‘individuals who voluntarily engage in forms of public participation 
and action around shared interests, purposes or values that are compat-
ible with the goals of the [UN].’47 Moreover, the Handbook describes the 
interconnected relationship between the OHCHR and civil society actors, 
providing some examples of how they interact. Civil society actors alert 
‘OHCHR to deteriorating human rights situations and emerging trends’; 
they provide ‘information to OHCHR on human rights situations, devel-
opments and alleged abuses, locally and nationally’; they work in ‘part-
nership with OHCHR on human rights seminars and workshops, human 
rights training programmes, and on national and regional projects to raise 
awareness of human rights’; and they work ‘with OHCHR to promote the 
ratification of human rights treaties and their implementation’.48
The OECD reinforces its commitment to ‘give a voice’ to civil society 
stakeholders. The OECD maintains that ‘stakeholders’ views are fac-
tored into the OECD’s work and OECD analyses are stronger when they 
include ‘the perspectives of civil society.’49 Furthermore, OECD engages 
with civil society through two core representative organs, a Business and 
Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD, and a Trade Union Advisory 
Committee.50 The core engagement or relationship the OECD maintains 
with civil society is through co-­operation with business and trade unions.51

OECD further engages with other civil society actors such as NGOs, think 
tanks, academia and citizens through regular consultations, conferences 
and workshops, and the annual OECD forum.52 Finally, the OECD claims 
that civil society actors’ ‘analytical work and consensus building’ that takes 
place in OECD committees, working groups, and expert groups ‘develop 
into government policies take place – and where civil society can have a 
real impact.’53
John Ruggie, in his influential work on regulating TNCs, describes the 
criticism others have made about the Guiding Principles and their inabil-
ity to empower the participation of civil society.54 Ruggie explains that 
during the drafting of the GPs, he held ‘bilateral’ meetings with NGOs 
and that civil society actors generally were the ‘largest single number of 
participants in the multi-­stakeholder consultations.’55 Moreover, Ruggie 
concedes that civil society participation is crucial to the success of the 
GPs. However, Ruggie responds to criticisms that the GPs should have 
included a ‘Fourth’ pillar concerning civil society with standards for civil 
society actors by stating that such a pillar would have faced resistance 
from civil society.56 In addition, Ruggie posits that he seriously doubts 
that this additional pillar would have survived the UN ‘political process 
of getting the GPs approved[,]’ describing such a proposed ‘participa-
tion’ pillar as a ­‘non-­starter’ for some stakeholders.57 Ruggie fears that 
criticisms about how the GPs fail to engage civil society will potentially 
create a ‘self-­fulfilling prophecy’ and instead invites those critics to shed 
further guidance ‘on how such organizations can use and build on GPs.’58 
I have suggested that an institutional role for NGOs might center on both 
their expertise and representational character built around their areas of 
expertise. They might usefully assume a role of advocate as well as monitor 
of state and TNC compliance with legal and societal norms, even as they 
continue to help craft them and naturalize these emerging norms within 
society.59

TNCs and political actors and governments    ­99
THE EVOLVING ECOLOGIES OF RELATIONSHIP 
BETWEEN TNCs AND POLITICAL ACTORS AND 
GOVERNMENTS
The conventional ecology, and the ideologies and premises that both define 
and constrain it, has been challenged by the emerging realities of economic 
globalization and its effects on diffusing governance power. And, indeed, 
the conventional understanding of law, especially its connection with the 
actions of a duly constituted state, have been challenged as well.60 Some 
analysts have suggested that perhaps some TNCs wield more power and 
influence than some nations. For example, some argue that the process 
of economic globalization has allowed some TNCs to gather more power 
and resources than the host nations in which TNCs operate.61 In fact, in 
1999, out of the top 100 economies, 51 were corporations.62 Furthermore, 
the largest TNCs have become crucial players both in the world and ‘the 
domestic jurisdictions in which they operate.’63 Another empowerment 
tool TNCs have are bilateral investment treaties (BITs). BITs often allow 
TNCs to threaten legal action against host states whenever TNCs perceive 
that enforcement of a specific law would harm the company or expropriate 
some of its business.64
It is not surprising that efforts at regulating TNCs have gained momen-
tum, especially through the UN Human Rights Council Working Group 
established in 2011, talks about a comprehensive treaty on business and 
human rights, and the latest UN Forum on Business and Human Rights. 
Some argue for a complete overhaul of how human rights accountability 
for TNCs must be organized. For example, Halpern argues that TNCs and 
other private non-­state actors should be scrutinized under a more consci-

entious human rights framework because the ability of TNCs to avoid any 
accountability for potential human rights violations has ­‘exponentially’ 
increased.65
Moreover, others argue that the interaction between TNCs and the 
most economically advanced state actors has facilitated TNCs’ ability to 
­circumvent regulation or even avoid accountability for possible human 
rights violations.66 A ‘coalescence’ of some of these governments and 
TNCs has led to agreements and the WTO framework that appears to 
advance the interests of TNCs.67 Yet another way TNCs interact with the 
government of various hosts states is through direct or indirect actions 
that affect the political landscape of these host states.68 TNCs may inter-
vene in the political affairs of host nations (mostly in developing ­countries) 
through direct contributions to political campaigns, bribing local gov-
ernment officials or co-­opting local elites.69 A classic example of TNC 
involvement is the overthrow of Chile’s democratically elected Marxist 
government of Salvador Allende.70
These challenges have revealed obstacles for governments, TNCs and civil 
society trying to interact in governance spaces. In regards to human rights 
accountability and international law, some argue that TNCs ­purposefully 
label themselves as bystanders in the field of international law.71 When 
TNCs get involved, as they often do, with state actors who happen to 
commit human rights violations, TNCs claim that they cannot be held 
accountable because they were just bystanders and did not willingly par-
ticipate in the alleged atrocities that may have been committed.72 Amerson 
argues that this ‘bystander’ label is a proxy ‘for the concept of the innocent 
bystander . . . [because] their role as an observer to the human rights atroci-
ties was that of an impartial observer, at the scene by happenstance, and

powerless to stop the tragedy that was happening on the ground.’73 This 
‘bystander’ label, Amerson argues, allows TNCs to escape liability because 
as ‘bystanders’ they cannot be held accountable for the human rights 
violation.74
Some argue that the TNCs’ ability to escape regulatory control and ‘to 
exert political pressures on decision makers’ creates a legal void.75 Kalimo 
and Staal define this legal void ‘as a regulatory situation in which a TNC 
behavior, permitted in a host state, would have been in violation of the laws 
of the TNC home state or of international law.’76 Kalimo and Staal further 
argue that although what they call ‘hard law’ has proved to be ineffective 
as a means of regulating TNCs, ‘soft law’ may fill the void left by hard law 
in governing TNCs.77
Lundan highlights one further interaction between TNCs and govern­
ment actors.78 Specifically, TNCs have been engaging in much more 
‘non-­market interactions involving civil society and quasi-­governmental 
institutions.’79 Lundan further recognizes three types of engage-
ment between TNCs and other institutions. These engagements were 
first ­recognized by Cantwell, Dunning, and Lundan.80 These are (1) 
­institutional avoidance, (2) institutional adaptation, and (3) coevolution.81 
Avoidance touches on TNC power to choose among different institu-
tional ­environments.82 Adaptation touches on institutional adaptation, 
TNCs ‘adjusts its structure to better fit the environment.’83 These efforts 
to adapt may include attempts to use political influence and even brib-
ery.84 Coevolution references the TNC’s ability ‘to effect change in the 
local formal and informal institutions.’ For example, the TNC may engage

These currents have produced some substantial changes in the ecology 
of relationships among governments, TNCs and civil society. These 
changes reflect not merely the currents of contemporary debate. They also 
represent a reasoned response to the challenges that have been posed by 
the breakdown of the old power order, built around states and national 
control of macroeconomic policy, which has given way to more fluid and 
interconnected relations among economic and civil society actors within, 
between and through states, and whose interactions center around the 
normative framework for managing the conduct of global production 
chains over which TNCs assert a substantial measure of control. It is to a 
consideration of these changing ecologies that this chapter turns to here. 
In particular, three are considered. The first is based on the TNC as the 
centering element of production chain order. The second is grounded on 
the emergence of non-­state governance centers which assert order through 
certification, verification and monitoring. The third posits the emergence 
of a multi-­stakeholder autonomous and self-­referencing system around 
TNC–NGO–Government relationships.
The TNC as the Centering Element of the Production Chain
It has become common to speak about corporate self-­constitution, not 
just in the domestic but also in the transnational sphere. Corporations 
have developed self-­referencing governance regulatory orders based on 
their power to manage production chains across borders. These are usually 
built around corporate control or influence throughout global produc-
tion chains. Usually governance is manifested through internal policies 
and contract terms in supplier codes of conduct and in the rules of 
­inter-­corporate operations.86 These are particularly relevant with respect 
to their connection with the public interest and corporate communication 
among stakeholders.87 Corporate self-­constitution and the emergence of

corporate conduct governance codes have changed the character of TNC–
NGO engagement. While both groups continue to work towards control 
of the discourse of corporate social responsibility, NGOs and TNCs now 
engage directly in formulating, monitoring and enforcing corporate codes 
of conduct through both formal and informal arrangements. Patti Rundall, 
policy director of the NGO Baby Milk Action, explained the difficulty:
about the phenomenon of partnerships between the United Nations, not-­for-­
profit non-­governmental organisations [NGOs working in the public interest], 
and for-­profit corporations [specifically transnational corporations or TNCs] 
which operate in many countries.
The development of partnerships has arisen, oddly enough, from a growing 
awareness of the damaging impact that TNCs can have on development, public 
health and the environment. NGOs are now aware of the need to think globally, 
and many are looking for ways to encourage corporate responsibility. In turn, 
TNCs are aware that they can no longer pursue profit with scant regard for the 
wider community.88
The ecologies of these relations are highly contextual but involve both 
partnership and competition for governance discourse and consensus.89 
They highlight both the cooperation and completion that marks the 
­relations among TNCs and NGOs as they work through the parameters of 
the governance of corporate behaviors within their production chains and 
internally with respect to their operations.
Walmart engages with NGOs in several ways and through several 
­partnerships. For example, Walmart is a founding member of the Alliance 
for Bangladesh Worker Safety, which is a group composed of brands and 
retailers seeking to improve working conditions for those who are employed 
in the ready-­made garment industry.90 The Alliance’s annual report from 
September 2015 states that it trained 1.2 million factory employees on 
basic fire safety.91 Furthermore, through a partnership with the Coalition 
of Immokalee Workers and Florida tomato suppliers, Walmart joined the 
Fair Food Program. Walmart asserts that its collaboration helped expand

its focus beyond tomatoes. Finally, again in the garment sector, Walmart 
has collaborated with the ILO and IFC’s Better World Program, designed 
to improve factory working conditions in the garment sector.92
Siemens includes NGOs as a key stakeholder in their 2015 Sustainability 
report.93 They claim that maintaining an ‘intensive dialog’ with their part-
ners along the supply chain and NGOs is important to the enterprise.94 
Moreover, Siemens asserts that they require their suppliers to comply 
with the principles of their ‘Code of Conduct for Siemens Suppliers and 
Third-­Party Intermediaries,’ which is based on the 10 principles of the UN 
Global Compact and reflects ‘Siemens Business Conduct Guidelines.’95 
Siemens monitors its supply chain through ‘sustainability self-­assessments 
by suppliers, risk evaluations conducted by our purchasing departments, 
sustainability questions within supplier quality audits and sustainability 
audits by external auditors.’96
Nike interacts with NGOs to ensure standards are met. For example, 
reports by NGOs and other labor activists in the early 1990s claimed that four 
Indonesian plants owned by Nike’s Korean suppliers were ‘rife with exploit­
ation, poor working conditions, and a range of human rights and labor 
abuses.’97 Another example of the Nike–NGO relationship is the 1997 leak 
of an audit performed by Ernst and Young of one of Nike’s Korean subcon-
tractor’s factory operating in Vietnam to the NGO Transnational Resource 
and Action Center (TRAC), which was later renamed CorpWatch.98 This 
report led to backlash and condemnation from other NGOs because it 
revealed that these factories in Vietnam were being operated in violation of 
Nike’s code of conduct.
Apple, much like Nike, has been criticized by NGOs. For example, 
Green America and China Labor Watch have called for a complete 
boycott of Apple’s products because of alleged dangerous working con-
ditions in plants operated by Apple’s manufacturing partners in China.99

a campaign to press Apple to find alternate sources of tin because 
the NGO believes that Apple may be mining tin from the Indonesian 
island of Bangka.100 Finally, NGOs’ campaigns aimed at Apple’s 
supply chain have forced the enterprise to ‘start reporting on supplier 
responsibility.’101
Samsung has stated that it recognizes the importance of collaborating 
with NGOs to address alleged human rights violations in mineral mining 
in conflict zones in Africa and environmental degradation on Bangka 
Island.102 Samsung claims that this collaboration is essential to finding 
‘effective measures to work toward responsible procurement of minerals 
in its supply chain.’103 In response, Samsung ‘plans to set up a monitoring 
system to track its suppliers’ use of conflict minerals.’ Also, the company 
has requested that its suppliers submit ‘lists of the smelters in their supply 
chains to be shared with global CSR-­related organizations,’ such as the 
Business of a Better World (BSR). Moreover, like Apple, Samsung was 
affected by the Friends of the Earth’s ‘Make it Better’ campaign which 
sought to bring attention to the environmental damage in Indonesia’s 
Bangka Island caused tin mining.104 As a result, Samsung promises to 
uphold its social responsibility and work with other electronic companies 
and NGOs ‘to ensure responsible and ethical sourcing of minerals.’105
British department store Marks and Spencer (M&S) established a 
partnership with Greenpeace UK regarding the company’s seafood 
supply chain. For example, in 1996 the enterprise adopted its Policy on 
Sustainable Sourcing of Fisheries Products. When Greenpeace issued 
a study of UK supermarkets entitled ‘Recipe for Disaster,’ it ranked 
M&S as number one based on their responsible seafood policy.106 The

Non-­state Governance through Certification, Verification and Monitoring
Corporate self-­constitution presents one set of structures within which 
political actors, and TNCs arrange their relationships. Another is 
grounded on the privatization of corporate responsibility codes within 
NGOs that themselves serve to produce, monitor and certify compliance 
with codes of behaviors that are normative but not legally binding.108 
These bring NGO and TNC relations within a direct governance frame-
work. But they can also affect the form and movement toward legaliza-
tion in states.109 They describe both closed circuits of governance in which 
NGOs provide the standards under which TNC operate, but also the 
means through which that conduct may be monitored and ‘certified.’ At 
the same time, it describes a system in which NGOs and TNCs vie for 
dominance in the construction of those principles through which such 
standards are ­developed and both interact with the state with respect to 
the possibility of the legalization of these ‘soft’ contractual consensus 
norms.110
Oxfam has been active in criticizing sports apparel companies for alleged 
violations of labor rights and suppression of union activity. For example, 
in 2006 Oxfam issued a report in which they ‘publicized the degree to 
which some sports apparel companies have responded to trade union 
rights violations in their supply chains.’111 The report calls out TNCs for 
not doing enough to ‘ensure trade union rights throughout their supply

its Indonesian factory called PT Doson, where they claim that Nike can-
celled an order with the factory once they found out that the factory had 
established a trade union.113
The Fair Labor Association (FLA) interacts with powerful TNCs, such 
as Apple and Nike. For example, one of the many ways that Nike seeks to 
enforce its Code of Conduct is through inspections from the FLA.114 The 
FLA conducts periodic inspections every year on a sample of 5 per cent of 
Nike suppliers across the world. FLA certification and monitoring provide 
a similar degree of supervision of Apple. Apple joined the FLA in 2012, 
allowing the association to audit working conditions in Apple’s supply 
chain.115 During one of these audits, the FLA ‘observed at least 50 issues 
related to the FLA Code and Chinese labor law, including in the ­following 
areas: health and safety, worker integration and communication, and 
wages and working hours[,]’ in Foxconn, Apple’s biggest final assembly 
supplier in China.116
Fair Trade USA, the leading fair-­trade certifier in the United States,

to ensure equitable trade practices at every level of the supply chain.’118

prises ‘must buy from certified farms and organizations, pay Fair Trade

and traceability in their global supply chains.’120
The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) offers two types of certification: 
Forest Management and Chain-­of-­Custody certification.121 With both 
certifications, independent certifiers ‘verify that all FSC-­certified forests 
conform to the requirements contained within an FSC forest management 
standard.’122 Moreover, with regards to supply chains through Chain-­
of-­Custody certification, the FSC ‘traces the path of products from 
forests through the supply chain, verifying that FSC-­certified ­material is 
identified or kept separated from non-­certified material throughout the 
chain.’123
Amnesty International (Amnesty) exposes corporate abuse in many dif-
ferent regions. Amnesty demands that TNCs be required by law to ­identify, 
prevent and address human rights abuses, that corporations be held 
accountable for abuses they commit, that people who have been affected 
by these abuses have access to justice and remedy, and that laws operate 
across borders to protect people’s rights.124 In an effort to accomplish these 
goals, they have ‘exposed countless instances when corporations exploit 
weak and poorly enforced domestic regulation with devastating effect 
on people and communities.’125 For example, in 2015 Amnesty released a 
report ­condemning the diamond trade in the Central African Republic.126 
Amnesty based their report on ‘extensive desk research on the international 
diamond supply chain, including reviewing documents on the import and 
export of diamond[,]’ as well as field research in four countries.127 During 
these field research missions, Amnesty ‘visited Dubai to investigate the

Amnesty also visited Belgium to investigate how Belgium implements the 
Kimberley Process, and this visit was ‘facilitated by the Antwerp World 
Diamond Centre (AWDC), and researchers met with representatives from 
AWDC and the Ministry of Economic Affairs (which oversees Belgium’s 
Diamond Office).’129 Amnesty based its findings on these and other types 
of similar research and monitoring missions.
The Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) is composed 
of several electronic enterprises. It provides ‘joint systematic responses to 
emerging CSR-­related topics and issues in the electronics industry,’ and 
establishes ‘operating principles and guidelines, such as the EICC Code 
of Conduct and standards, etc.’130 The ‘EICC Code of Conduct is a set 
of standards on social, environmental and ethical issues in the ­electronics 
industry supply chain.’131 EICC has collaborated with ­electronics enter-
prises such as Samsung; for example, Samsung has ‘conducted an audit 
on the use of conflict minerals by its major suppliers both inside and 
outside of Korea using the EICC conflict minerals reporting template.’132 
Moreover, the EICC offers a variety of tools for TNCs to conform to the 
EICC’s standards, such as audits, and many others.133 The EICC states that 
these tools ‘help members meet [EICC] standards and drive continuous 
improvement.’
The Emergence of Multi-­stakeholder Autonomous and Self-­referencing 
Systems
Corporate self-­governance and TNC–NGO certification systems focus 
on the relationships among TNCs and political actors. Simultaneously 
with the development of these systems are those, principally at the level 
of public international organizations, that have sought to adopt specific 
normative standards and, at least in the case of the OECD Guidelines 
for Multinational Enterprises,134 to adopt rudimentary remedial systems.

These, then, center a three-­way relationship that is built around gov-
ernance frameworks, but governance beyond the state and beyond 
law. These are standards addressed to states but applied to enterprises. 
These are standards that are not binding but which leave a large space 
for  ­political  actors to use them to develop consensus on corporate 
behaviors.
The OECD system of principles for the management of corporate behavior 
beyond the domestic law of states creates a three-­dimensional governance 
‘space’ through networks of soft law systems developed by complex partner-
ships between states, international organizations that serve them and global 
actors, and the global actors that form the core of the regulatory community.135
The clearest example is drawn from the recent work of the OECD’s National 
Contact Point system for the enforcement of global soft law frameworks that 
radiate out from the OECD’s Guidelines for Multinational Corporations.136
These principles tie autonomous multinational regulatory systems to the law 
systems of states in which they operate, but at the same time, institutionalize a 
stateless space.137
The UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights138 provide 
a normative framework for the governance of enterprise behavior. It is 
grounded on the institutionalization of relations among states (through a

48004323.pdf>.
135  And thus seeks to rebut the early conceptual critique: ‘[S]oft law expresses 
a preference and not an obligation that states should act, or should refrain from 
acting, in a specified manner. The underlying assumption is that behavior, or 
forbearance from behavior, in accordance with this preference will be directly 
beneficial to states.’ Joseph Gold, Interpretation: The IMF and International Law 
(Springer, 1996) 301. This governance space is sometimes understood as ‘space-
less’ in the sense that it moves governance beyond territory, and thus beyond 
the premises that constrain law making in the state system. See, e.g., Larry 
Catá Backer, ‘Transnational Corporate Constitutionalism: The Emergence of 
a Constitutional Order for Economic Enterprises’ (10 April 2012) <http://ssrn.

state duty to protect human rights), TNCs (through a corporate respon-
sibility to respect human rights), and political actors (through remedial 
provisions). Professor Ruggie noted early in the process of Guidelines 
formulation:
The ‘protect, respect and remedy’ framework lays the foundations for generat-
ing the necessary means to advance the business and human rights agenda. 
It spells out differentiated yet complementary roles and responsibilities for 
states and companies, and it includes the element of remedy for when things 
go wrong. It is systemic in character, meaning that the component parts are 
intended to support and reinforce one another, creating a dynamic process 
of cumulative progress – one that does not foreclose additional longer-­term 
­meaningful measures.139
A 2015 ‘Final Statement’ of a National Contact Point (NCP) proceeding 
from Canada evidences the relational aspects of these multi-­stakeholder 
public–private mechanisms.140 The Canadian NCP announced that, 
although Canada would not embed the Guidelines into its domestic legal 
order directly, Canada would enforce an expectation that Canadian enter-
prises would promote Canadian values abroad, including the values in the 
Guidelines and that a ‘Company’s non-­participation in the NCP process 
will be taken into consideration in any applications by the Company for 
enhanced advocacy support from the Trade Commissioner Service and/ or 
Export Development Canada (EDC) financial services, should they be 
made.’141 But more importantly, the NCP process itself encourages a broad 
participation from political actors. These may use the quasi-­remedial 
processes of NCP proceedings to frame their interactions with TNCs and 
states.142 Thus the Guidelines provide a framework within which TNCs, 
governments and political actors can structure their relations within a

system that is governance-­oriented but not law. As in other emerging forms 
of governance, relationships follow structures of governance. But ­critical 
to all governance are the simultaneously cooperative and adversarial 
­relations between TNCs and political organizations.
IS THERE A META-­THEORY HERE?
Taken together the structures of the relationships among states, TNCs 
and NGOs appear to produce an ecology the purpose and effects of which 
are contested but from which certain generalizations may be extracted. 
The possibility of corporate self-­constitution and NGO standard setting 
and governance suggests a set of parameters for inter-­group relations that 
has systemic quality. The TNC stands at the center of the system.143 These 
serve as system legislator through contracts that imposes a complex set of 
norms with social, cultural and political effects. These are enforced against 
its controlled groups – along production chains. Though they affect others 
those relationships and effects have societal but no legal effect. These 
standards themselves are also targeted to key outsider stakeholders for 
whom such codes may be important enough to affect their own conduct, 
the enterprise’s investors and customers. While the standards are devel-
oped and implemented by the enterprise, they are usually constructed 
with input from elements of civil society – non-­governmental organiza-
tions that have a policy or other interest in the subject of the standards. 
At the same time, the TNC expends much energy shaping consumer and 
investor opinion.
Non-­governmental organizations help shape the standards that TNCs 
implement. They participate in the creation of standards actually devel-
oped by enterprises, and, perhaps most important, they serve as inde-
pendent monitors of compliance with these standards. The work of many 
organizations mobilized in large and small scale campaigns against this 
practice contributed to the formation of a public opinion that made it 
desirable for an enterprise to adopt policies against the practice beyond 
a mere reliance on the will of the local government to actually enforce 
­whatever sanctions that had been imposed there by law. But most 
­importantly, non-­governmental organizations are instrumental in moni-
toring compliance with the norms adopted by TNCs to govern the behav-
ior of its suppliers and their subcontractors. And there is an economic 
aspect to the ­participation of non-­governmental organizations as well.

TNCs and political actors and governments    ­113
Involvement in the efforts of TNCs to harmonize the regulation of their 
supplier chains through the imposition of labor, environmental and other 
norms, is a critical source of funds, motivating members and increasing 
membership in such organizations. TNC regulatory work is good for the 
business of non-­governmental organizations.
Critical to the work of both the TNC and the non-­governmental 
organization is the media. Newspapers, television, internet-­based news 
and other information dissemination enterprises play a critical role in the 
development and enforcement of TNC-­developed standards of conduct. 
The media serves principally to legitimate the work of both multinational 
actors legislating conduct over their networks of stakeholders or the moni-
toring work of non-­governmental organizations. The media, then, serves as 
the critical vehicle for communication across stakeholder organizations and 
to consumers, investors, and governments. The media sometimes mediates 
conversations among these groups as well. This is good for business. Such 
a role inures to the benefit of the media as an industry in its own right. The 
media is the largest consumer of information on the globe. Information is a 
critical factor in the production of news – the product that makes money for 
the media. Corporate social responsibility targeted at consumers and inves-
tors, overseen by TNCs and monitored by non-­governmental organizations 
are very good for the business of the production of news.
Like the citizens and residents of political states, consumers and inves-
tors play a critical yet passive role in the governance systems of TNCs. 
By their actions, consumers and investors (collectively) determine the 
efficacy of the actions of each stakeholder – consumption of the products 
and investment vehicles peddled by TNCs, support for the efforts of non-­
governmental organizations, readership of media. Consumers and inves-
tors are the object of the efforts of the other stakeholders in this system 
to get them to act on certain sets of beliefs. Control of the beliefs and 
desires of these groups – or the ability to express those beliefs and desires 
as policies, rules and conduct (and impose all of those on those in networks 
of control) – affects the shape and character of the ‘desires’ of TNCs 
(and their taste for things like social responsibility, good ­governance, 
­environmental protection, long-­ or short-­term strategic thinking and the 
like) and the extent of their willingness to legislate for their network of 
stakeholders. To a great extent, then, corporate regulation has moved from 
a foundation in efficiency to a focus on values and their elaboration in the 
action of economic actors.144

Like consumers and investors, government – both domestic and 
­international public entities – plays a significant but passive role in the 
control of the social and economic relationships of TNCs and their 
­suppliers. Government serves as a source of authentic memorialization of 
conduct norms. It is not necessarily the legal effect of these norms so much 
as their expression of communal values they express that count. As import­
ant, governmental pronouncements and actions, international and domes-
tic declarations of policy or aspirational goals tend to set the parameters of 
the debate that produces beliefs in consumers and investors on which both 
governmental and non-­governmental actors base their own responses. And 
lastly, government sometimes tends to follow the actions of its stakeholders.
But what of the objects of all of this activity – the business people 
operating supplier factories, or their subcontractors, the children and 
their families, and the local communities in which all of these activities 
occur? These groups tend to be objectified and muscled out of direct and 
primary engagement in governance and governance-­related relationships 
among the privileged groups of stakeholders. Conditions are improved to 
better their condition. Business relationships are changed on the basis of 
values that might or might not be shared by local business. Yet there is little 
expectation that the objects of all these activities will actually participate 
actively in the formation and elaboration of standards and enforcement 
norms. All of those are imposed from outside the communities affected. 
Global power, in effect, is exercised on their behalf, but based on the sensi-
bilities of consumers and investors in developed states. From the perspec-
tive of the global order, it seems that the people of the developed world 
continue to impose their beliefs on others. This time, it is for their own 
good and the moral betterment of those who impose their values, through 
their decisions to purchase goods or invest in financial instruments.145 This 
remains the greatest challenge of the relations among TNCs, NGOs and 
­governments – as they all each engage with each other there appears very 
little engagement by the objects of all of this activity. From the perspective 
of democratic legitimacy, the issue remains substantially unexplored.
Relations among TNCs, governments and political actors are functions 
of power – principally regulatory power. Shifts in regulatory power, in 
turn, are a function of the great changes in the regulatory sphere made

possible by the free movement of goods, capital, and investment made 
possible through globalization. The nature and extent of NGO engage-
ment, of their relations with states and TNCs has changed as the scope 
of governance has expanded, as the role of international governmental 
­organizations and TNC self-­governance has grown. Relations are under-
stood best as power relations. But these relations are a function of power 
sharing among the three within the sphere of governance. But societal 
power also shapes the structures and direction of relations among these 
actors. Here one understands power relations in terms of the influence 
of TNCs, states and NGOs to shape the discourse and expectations, the 
normative expectations, that serve as the foundations of governance. 
The relations among these actors have become, to some extent, a mirror 
for the engagement of the emerging manifestations of popular power in 
­representative form. The battlegrounds – the space within which corporate 
social responsibility is managed beyond the state, for the state and through 
the state – define the spaces within which relations among these actors 
now serve in lieu of the traditional relations among state, demos and their 
normative political ideologies.
CONCLUSION: WHAT MAY LIE AHEAD?
This chapter considered the nature of the relationships among TNCs, 
political actors and government as a set of emerging ecologies of political 
economy. The evolving relations among them represent a distinct response 
to the transformation of the global legal, economic and political order in 
the face of globalization. Each exists autonomously and is evolving simul-
taneously, yet each is significantly interconnected within a polycentric 
governance order that lends overall structure without a centering posi-
tion. The chapter started with the conventional and traditional ecology 
of relationships, centered on the state. It then considered the three most 
distinctive forms of emerging relational ecologies that de-­center the state. 
The first is based on the TNC as the centering element of production chain 
order. The second is grounded on the emergence of non-­state governance 
centers which assert order through certification, verification, and monitor-
ing. The third posits the emergence of a public–private multi-­stakeholder 
autonomous and self-­referencing system. The chapter then briefly consid-
ered the possibility that these structured relations suggest something like 
meta theory structuring that is disaggregated and scattered by intermeshed 
systems that have arisen around the state.
What lies ahead? Projecting outward in time it seems clear that the spaces 
for governance created through economic globalization have also produced

substantial transformations in the nature, structures and frameworks 
within which the relationships among states, TNCs and political actors 
are understood and manifested. Though the state remains a critical actor, 
relationships no longer are networked exclusively through or for the object 
of inducing state action. TNCs and political organizations are as likely to 
engage in governance related interactions as both are to reach out to the 
state. And even in the context of public institutional communi­cation, those 
interactions might as likely be made to or through international public 
bodies as they are to be directed to any single or group of states. Among 
these stakeholders, the nature of communications continues to be complex. 
To some extent cooperation mechanisms – tilted toward joint governance 
efforts – are likely to continue to grow. Yet because the interests of politi-
cal actors and TNCs do not align, there will be instances of relations that 
are adversarial – from those touching on monitoring and assessing TNC 
conduct to projections of stakeholder power onto consumer and investor 
communities to seek to influence discourse (and consensus) on appropri-
ate behavior rules. What is certain, though, is that the relationship among 
these actors will be central to the evolution of governance norms and 
structures applied increasingly to production chains across states well into 
this century.

4.  The UN Global Compact
Maria Alejandra Gonzalez-­Perez 
and Liam Leonard
The Global Compact asks companies to embrace universal principles and to 
partner with the United Nations. It has grown to become a critical platform for 
the UN to engage effectively with enlightened global business.
– UN Secretary-­General Ban Ki-­moon (2007– 2016)1
INTRODUCTION
The United Nations Global Compact has generated both success and 
­criticism since its inception in 2000. The Global Compact has been criti-
cised by some observers, who believe that the United Nations loses some 
of its independence through alliances with corporate entities. This chapter 
will discuss the significance of the Global Compact within a number of 
contexts. These contexts include an examination of the Global Compact’s 
origins, key participants and its principal signatories. The details of the 
UN Global Compact Governance structures will be outlined to allow a 
better understanding of how the agency operates regionally and inter-
nationally. The extent of Global Compact members’ engagement with 
corporate social responsibility, and related issues such as environmental 
protection, human rights and social issues, will be detailed, and the interac-
tion between the UN and engaged participants, from both the business and 
non-­business sectors, will also be outlined. This will be supplemented by 
an account of the Ten Principles which lie at the heart of this endeavour. 
Finally, the connectivity between the United Nations Global Compact and 
the global market will be discussed.
The introductory quote from UN Secretary-­General Ban Ki-­moon 
outlines the underlying concepts that shape the UN Global Compact 
(UNGC). Since its inception in July 2000, The Compact has provided a 
framework for businesses, labour groups, agencies, advocacy groups and 
the United Nations to work together to promote a more equitable world

for markets, employers and employees. The journey undertaken by UNGC 
participants can be understood from this quote by its former Executive 
Director Georg Kell:
At the UN Global Compact launch in 2000, approximately 40 companies came 
together with a dozen labour and civil society leaders to commit to universal 
principles. Today, the Global Compact stands at 8,000 companies and 4,000 
non-­business signatories based in 150 countries, representing nearly every 
industry sector, size, and with equal representation from developed and develop-
ing countries. The idea and practice of responsible business has been rooted in 
all continents, and our 100 Local Networks are convening companies and acting 
on key issues at the ground level.2
At the heart of the Global Compact, we find the core value of ‘global 
citizenship’. From a United Nations perspective, the idea of active global 
citizenship can be understood through the main priorities of the priorities 
of the Global Education First Initiative led by the UN Secretary-­General. 
These priorities include the following:
●
●
Put Every Child in School: education for all children by overcoming 
obstacles such as child labour, discrimination and financial barriers;
●
●
Quality of Learning: overcoming barriers to learning such as lan-
guage barriers, teacher shortages, lack of learning materials, family 
support and foundations for learning, and hunger and nutritional 
issues;
●
●
Global Citizenship: dealing with issues such as outmoded educa-
tional systems and curricula, focusing on leadership, values and 
teaching skills, and promoting the common good in today’s world.3
The UNGC provides an opportunity for business and agencies to support 
initiatives such as Global Citizenship Education (GCE). The creation of 
this form of global citizenship ethic lay at the heart of the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDG, 2008–2015) and remain fundamental to the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs, 2016–2020). The UNGC provides 
a platform for participants to become part of transformative activities on 
a transnational level. Key activities include participation in programmes 
which allow business and agencies to help provide clean water, food and

improved agricultural production and enhanced peace-­building capacities. 
The ‘Ten Principles’ of the UN Global Compact provide participants with 
a humane and rights-­based framework from which contributions may be 
developed (see below). These Principles will be explored in more detail 
later in the chapter. The ‘Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact’ are 
set out in the following manner:
The UN Global Compact asks companies to embrace, support and 
enact, within their sphere of influence, a set of core values in the areas of 
human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-­corruption.4 
These principles are derived from:
●
●
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
●
●
The International Labour Organisation’s Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work
●
●
The Rio Declaration on Environment and Development
●
●
The United Nations Convention Against Corruption
Once these Principles were agreed upon, the UN Global Compact 
established its framework for governance. This governance must be trans-
national, dynamic and flexible in order to deal with rapidly changing 
issues, while maintaining an ethical set of core values. Global Compact 
Governance has a voluntary and network-­based ethic, as outlined in the 
2005 UN Global Compact governance review and updated in 2008. The 
governance review recommended a process whereby stakeholders could 
take ownership of projects, with reduced bureaucracy and increased cor-
porate and agency participation and involvement. As a result of these 
initiatives, the Global Compact Donor Group was reconstituted as the 
‘Global Compact Government Group’.
GLOBAL COMPACT GOVERNANCE
Global Compact Governance (GCG) is an overall framework designed 
to facilitate a series of tasks. These tasks include running entities such as 
the Global Compact Leaders Summit, Local GCG Networks, the Local 
Network Forum, the Global Compact Board and Office and the Global 
Compact Governance Group. The Leaders Summit meets every three 
years and brings together key stakeholders and participant ­executives.

The focus of the Leaders Summit is global citizenship. Participants 
discuss new initiatives and implementation. The Local Networks are 
regional groups within the Global Compact. They provide various cul-
tural contexts and oversee regional growth and expansion. The Networks 
also assist corporations in devising best practices in relation to the Ten 
Principles. With over 100 Local Networks globally, opportunities to par-
ticipate in projects are communicated via networks to participants, and 
also individual participants could design and implement initiatives, in 
which the local networks might play a co-­ordinating role. Local Networks 
maintain local autonomy through self-­governance; they nominate offi-
cials for election to the Global Compact Board and participate in the 
Local Networks Forum.
The Global Compact Board is the overall advisory body for stake-
holders, with 31 members. It is comprised of four main groupings; the 
United Nations and representatives of Labour, Business and Civil Society. 
Key officials in the UN Global Compact such as the UN Secretary-­General 
also participate in the Global Compact Board, alongside the Foundation 
Chair, the Investments Chair and the UNGC Office Director. The UNGC

Board seeks to implement initiatives with integrity, as they liaise with their 
constituent communities.5
The Global Compact Office provides management and expertise for the 
UNGC. The UNGC Office promotes new methods and best practices, 
provides leadership and oversees network development. The Office also 
maintains communications links across the UNGC, develops partner-
ships with other UN agencies, and plays a role in all of the activities 
of the Global Compact governance structures. The Global Compact 
Governance Group operates with the support of 13 UN member states 
(China, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) 
who provide funds for its existence. The United States does not participate 
in the UNGC as it was considered contrary to US foreign and economic 
policy under President George W. Bush.
The Global Compact Government Group develops Strategies and Work 
Plans for the UN Compact. These states also contribute to the UNGC 
Trust fund and UNGC Local Networks as well as supporting regional 
Global Compact initiatives. These states may also provide staff for 
UNGC Officers, events or further studies in this area. The Government 
Group reviews the progress of initiatives and maintains the efficiency and 
­effectiveness in Global Compact processes.6
GLOBAL COMPACT PARTICIPANTS
In response to the rise of neoliberal relationships between markets and 
societies (and increasing interactions between transnational corpora-
tions and non-­governmental organisations), corporate citizenship, cor-
porate governance and corporate social responsibility initiatives can 
be understood as attempts to engage transnational corporations with 
regional ­communities.7 The UN Global Compact (UNGC) is an example

It is currently the largest corporate citizenship international network, 
framework and voluntary mechanism joined (as of September 2016) by 
over 22,446 organisations of all types around the world, with two thirds 
having joined since 2010, as shown in Figures 4.1 and 4.2.
Business participation in the Global Compact by a firm requires a com-
mitment at the highest managerial level to implement, promote and report 
on the UNGC Principles, and to contribute to the broad development 
objectives of the UNGC (Millennium Development Goals and 2030 sus-
tainable development agenda). An explicit written commitment by the 
company’s chief executive officer (or equivalent) supported by its govern-
ance body is required. Participating companies are asked to make a regular 
annual (often tax deductible) financial contribution to support the work of 
the UN Global Compact Office. For 2016, the minimum suggested annual 
contribution for organisations with annual sales below US$50 million was 
$250. This suggested contribution increases according to the annual sales/
revenue of participant companies.

ground.12 According to UN Global Compact’s head Georg Kell (2000–2015), 
the growing strengths and weaknesses of the Global Compact participants 
demonstrate growth with ‘continued relevance of the initiative’s ­underlying 
idea, sustained institutional leadership support, governmental support 
(political back-­up), and operational viability.’13
The reasons why companies participated in the Global Compact, and 
their perceived impact vary.14 Companies participating in the UNGC 
receive both reputational and economic benefits in being part of the 
global initiative.15 Some companies have indicated that participating 
in the  UNGC could increase network opportunities and also improve 
­corporate image.16
The Global Compact emerged in a context in which the international 
economic order (constructed after World War II) relied on an ideologi-
cal consensus that the responsibility of the State in addressing national 
socio-­economic needs, was challenged by the presence and power of global 
networks of production, consumption and finances in which interna-
tional business and corporate actors have an active role to play in tackling 
­socio-­economic issues.17
On January 1999, then-­UN Secretary-­General Kofi Annan addressed 
the audience at the World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos, Switzerland, 
engaging the attention of the participants and encouraging them to take 
action on the fragility of globalisation, the rising inequality in wealth dis-
tribution, the imbalances in governance and regulations for human rights, 
environmental and social issues, and the unsustainability of the current 
levels of degradation of natural resources. Kofi Annan proposed a recon-
nection among expanding international-­markets players and core human 
values, suggesting that international business, governments, and all types 
of organisations around the world have a substantial responsibility of 
embracing new business models and social responsibility networks in order 
to reverse the negative effects of globalisation by giving a ‘human face to 
the global market.’

The UN Global Compact    ­125
At the WEF, Kofi Annan maintained that international businesses 
and multinational companies could use their economic power and high 
standards as models in their spheres of influence for leveraging ­principles 
of human rights, labour rights and environmental protection. As part of 
his speech, the Secretary-­General suggested a role that the United Nations 
and its agencies could play in adopting this global challenge, specifically 
the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), 
the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the United  Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP). The International Chamber of 
Commerce on 5 July 1999 adopted a statement ‘arguing for a stronger 
United Nations as the most sensible way forward, and pledged to work 
with United Nations agencies to implement the Global Compact at the 
corporate level.’18 Business, governments and civil society organisations 
with different points of view on other issues united to ­overwhelmingly 
support the UN initiative, and the Global Compact was officially launched 
together with framework for action on July 2000 at the UN Headquarters 
in New York.19
By 2014, the Global Compact office is supported by seven bodies: 
(1)  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 
(2) Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, (3) International 
Labour Organisation, (4) United Nations Environment Programme, 
(5)  United  Nations Development Programme, (6) the United Nations 
Office for Drugs and Crime and (7) the United Nations Industrial 
Development Organisation.
Because of varying interests and social relations of power between 
the profit-­driven MNEs and not-­for-­profit and cause-­motivated organi-
zations, perceptions of the Global Compact differ.20 On one hand, the 
UNGC faced high-­pitched criticisms and generated suspicion from non-­
governmental organisations, which warily regard the Global Compact as 
a possible opportunity for ‘corporate criminals’ to ‘bluewash’ their image 
‘by wrapping themselves in the flag of the United Nations.’21 They fear 
that the UNGC may become part of a corporate-­led, highly ­exclusionary

neoliberal strategy to legitimate MNEs’ increasing social power.22 On 
the other hand, those who support the UNGC might have unrealistic 
expectations.23
In some countries, governments have designed and implemented 
­corporate social responsibility policies (and laws) based on Global 
Compact Principles. These policies help ensure that UNGC principles are 
complemented by domestic institutions and policies and, in practice, have 
also served as measures for promoting the international competitiveness of 
domestic businesses.24
THE TEN PRINCIPLES
The UN Global Compact’s intentional goal is that organisations embrace, 
support and promote a set of ten principles grouped into four areas: human 
rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-­corruption. Their level 
of involvement reflects their capacity to promote these ten Principles in 
their spheres of influence. The UN Global Compact was initially launched 
with nine key Principles, but the tenth principle – anti-­corruption – was 
added at the Global Compact Leaders Summit on June 2004.
Human Rights
One of the most challenging areas of business sustainability is the respect 
and support for human rights. The human rights principles of the UN 
Global Compact are taken from the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (UDHR) that was originally adopted on 10 December 1948 and 
ratified in 1949 by the United Nations General Assembly in Paris. The 
UDHR consists of 30 articles and was directly inspired by the atrocities 
experienced during World War II, and this represented the first global con-
sensus of ‘Never Again’, expressing the (individual and group) rights and

dignity that all human beings are inherently entitled to ‘without distinc-
tion as to race, sex, language or religion’.25 Despite the universal character 
of the UDHR, this Declaration has been criticized by some authors26 for 
having a Western bias, for example by not including Islamic Shari’ah  con-
siderations. Also, Islam focuses on personal responsibility, and it does not 
admit corporations as legal persons, which could undermine the notion 
of corporate responsibility.27 Nonetheless, since the doctrines of Islam 
offer an explicit codification of ethical standards and precise enforcement, 
it may be compatible with the UN Global Compact and with corporate 
social responsibility values.28
Traditionally human rights had only concerned States and were only 
addressed by international human rights instruments. However, since the 
announcement in 2011 of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights by the Human Rights Council more companies (regardless of their 
size, location or industry) were confronted with the idea that they should 
address and adopt human rights frameworks in their commercial and 
­production activities.
The first two principles of the Global Compact are:
  1.  Businesses should support and respect the protection of internation-
ally proclaimed human rights; and
  2.  Make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.
Labour
The UN Global Compact includes four labour principles, derived from 
the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. 
This Declaration was adopted in 1988 at the 86th International Labour 
Conference, and it states that ‘all Members, even if they have not ratified 
the Conventions in question, have an obligation arising from the very fact 
of membership in the Organisation to respect, to promote and to realise, 
in good faith and in accordance with the Constitution, the principles con-
cerning the fundamental rights which are subject of those Conventions.’

This Declaration references eight core conventions, which cover collective 
freedom of association and collective bargaining, abolition of forced 
labour, effective abolition of labour by children before the end of com-
pulsory school, and no workplace discrimination.29, 30 The Declaration 
clearly states that these rights have universal coverage and apply to each 
worker in all States (regardless of the economic and social development 
level of the country). The four labour principles included in the Global 
Compact are:
  3.	 Businesses should uphold the freedom of association and the effect­
ive recognition of the right to collective bargaining;
  4.	 Eliminate all forms of forced and compulsory labour;
  5.	 Abolish child labour; and
  6.	 Eliminate discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.
Environment
The UN Global Compact includes three environment principles that 
reflect corporate environmental responsibility. These principles are derived 
from the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. The 
Rio Declaration consists of 27 principles to guide future international 
sustainable development. These environmental principles aim to address 
environmental challenges such as climate change, drinking water availabil-
ity, pollution, ecosystems damages, waste production, deforestation, and 
land degradation, among others. These principles are:
  7.	 Businesses should support a precautionary approach to environmen-
tal challenges;
  8.	 Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibil-
ity; and
  9.	 Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly 
technologies.
Anti-­Corruption
Controlling corruption and establishing and implementing sanctions 
for corrupt practices are often considered the sole domain of public 
­authorities. But in the last decade civil society (including the private sector)

has increased proactive measures to fight corruption.31 The tenth Global 
Principle addresses one of the greatest world challenges. Corruption 
interferes with sustainable development, skews competition, obstructs 
economic growth, incurs severe legal penalties, affects reputations and 
undercuts liberal economic mechanisms. This principle was only included 
in 2004, and it derives from the United Nations Convention Against 
Corruption (UNCAC), which was the first legally binding international 
anti-­corruption instrument. The UNCAC contains 71 Articles and 
requires all Member States to implement measures for preventing and 
criminalising corrupt acts. The Global Compact Working Group on the 
10th Principle includes the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, Transparency 
International, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the World 
Economic Forum Partnership Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) and 
the World Bank Institute (WBI).
10.  Businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including 
extortion and bribery.
SUPPLY CHAIN SUSTAINABILITY AND THE 
GLOBAL COMPACT
Sustainability of products depends to a large extent on the control pro-
ducer companies can exercise over the sustainability attributes of their 
suppliers; the collaboration and engagement mechanisms companies 
can develop across their supply chain. To fulfil these aims, it is crucial 
to ensuring the credibility of sustainability claims through tracking 
human rights, environment, labour (including health and safety), and 
anti-­corruption impacts of supplier activities. Traceability is the process 
of pinpointing and tracking the constituents of a product from raw 
­material to completed good.32 The UN Global Compact encourages com-
panies to incorporate and promote material initiatives to integrate the ten 
principles into supply chain management systems. The Global Compact 
together with Business of a Better Word (BSR) launched in April 2014 the

in their supply chain.
FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE GLOBAL 
COMPACT
Over the past decades, environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
­considerations have increasingly attracted the attention of investors, 
­activists and academics. Terms such as socially responsible investment 
(SRI), sustainable investment and ethical investment have been used since 
the 1990s and have only intensified following the global financial crisis. In 
June 2004, the UN Global Compact at the UN Headquarters in New York 
initiated meetings with a number of global stock exchanges and proposed 
the initiative ‘Who Cares Wins’ for encouraging investors and analysts to 
focus on ESG materiality and how these are related to climate change, 
­anti-­corruption, water and human rights.
Investors and financial analysts who take into consideration ESG 
criteria reject investment in industries and sector regarded unacceptable 
for ethical or moral reasons. Instead, they preference potential portfolio 
companies with good ESG performance and considered compatible with 
societal interests. As an example, the Equator Principles (EPs), which 
have been adopted by over 80 financial institutions, were proposed in 
2013 to be a credit risk management framework for identifying, and 
managing social and environmental risks to support responsible risk 
decision-­making.35
Also, in 2009, the United Nations Conference for Trade and Develop­
ment (UNCTAD) together with the Principles for Responsible Investment 
(PRI) held meetings at the UN Headquarters in Geneva with stock 
exchanges, public policy officials, investors and financial information 
providers. This meeting resulted in a call for action by UNCTAD, Global

Compact and PRI motivated the UN initiative: The Sustainable Stock 
Exchanges (SSE). For the SEE, UNCTAD has developed voluntary tech-
nical assistance for stock exchanges and regulators (who have responsibil-
ity in the ­implementation of sustainability report initiatives).36
These initiatives create market-­rewarded incentives for stock exchange 
listed transnational corporations to increment materiality in their ESG 
practices, and to be transparent when reporting progress towards the ten 
UNGC principles.
Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)
Financial markets around the world have increasingly incorporated 
the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). These principles were 
launched at the New York Stock Exchange in April 2006 and are specially 
directed towards large institutional investors (e.g., pension funds). By 
May 2014, there were 1,258 signatories to the PRI. To become a voluntary 
signatory to the PRI, companies must demonstrate public commitment to 
responsible investment and ensure their interest in building more sustain-
able financial systems by committing to six principles. These principles are:
1.	 Incorporate ESG issues into investment analysis and the decision-­
making process.
2.	 Actively incorporate ESG issues into companies’ ownership policies 
and practices.
3.	 Provide appropriate disclosure on ESG issues.
4.	 Accept and implement the PRI within the investment industry.
5.	 Work together to enhance effectiveness in implementing the Principles.
6.	 Report activities and progress towards implementing the Principles.
Global Compact 100 (b)
On September 2013, the UN Global Compact, in partnership with 
Sustainalytics, launched the Global Compact 100 (GC 100) Index, which 
is comprised of 100 companies which have demonstrated leadership and 
commitment to the UN Global Compact’s ten principles and have also dem-
onstrated financial health (steady base-­line profitability). Sustainalytics is 
a research and analysis organisation created in Canada in 1992 to serve

financial institutions and investors in providing ESG ­information to 
support sustainable investment decision-­making. The UNGC 100 was 
released at the Global Compact Leaders Summit in 2013. During its 
first year (2013), the indexed companies averaged investment returns of 
26.4 per cent (exceeding the global stock market).37
Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI)
Another mechanism to integrate the Global Compact into the financial 
markets and which informs investors concerned with the sustainabil-
ity performance of the companies in their portfolio is the Dow Jones 
Sustainability Index (DJSI). The DJSI was launched in 1999, as the first 
global sustainability benchmark. It comprises 2,500 large companies 
listed on the Dow Jones Global Total Stock Market Index that have excep-
tional sustainability standards, and therefore are a reference point for 
investors who are considering sustainability in their investment decisions. 
The Dow Jones Sustainability Index considers the financial, environmen-
tal and social performance of companies as well as sector-­specific sustain-
ability criteria. To be included in the index, companies are assessed based 
on their long-­term performance in the mentioned dimensions (financial, 
environmental and social), and on the provision of longstanding sus-
tainability plans to address this. The DJSI has a global index, as well as 
specific regional and country benchmarks in the Asia Pacific, Emerging 
Markets, North America, Australia, Eurozone 40 and the Nordic region. 
The indexing criteria are updated yearly, and companies included in the 
index are continuously monitored through a corporate sustainability 
assessment.
GLOBAL COMPACT LOCAL NETWORKS (GCLNs)
The Global Compact can be understood as a ‘Global Policy Network sup-
porting ten universal principles in the areas of human rights, labour stand-
ards, environmental protection and anti-­corruption.’38 Since its ­beginning, 
the Global Compact has, rather than taking a regulatory approach,

The UN Global Compact    ­133
adopted an explicit learning approach to encourage corporate change.39 
Local networks integrate domestic dimensions (cultural, economic, social 
and environmental) in their discussions and priorities.
According to the Global Compact, by 2012 there were 101 Local 
networks around the world. The Global Compact has established local 
networks in countries geographically distributed across all the continents. 
These networks were mostly established before 2005, with a few excep-
tions such as Australia (2009), Belgium (2009), Ecuador (2011), Republic 
of Korea (2007), Russia (2008), Viet Nam (2007), and the United States 
(2007). Local networks play a pivotal role in the governance of the Global 
Compact, and they have the participation of business (domestic and 
multinational operations operating locally) of all sizes, academic institu-
tions, government entities and NGOs. Local network representatives meet 
together in the Annual Local Networks Forum chaired and coordinated 
by the Global Compact Office. Also, working in networks facilitates the 
progress and implementation of the ten principles in current and potential 
members, and according to Executive Director Kell, the initiatives and 
contributions of the local networks ‘provide an important base to jump-­
start action and awareness on the ground.’40
Almost one-­third of the organisations (business and non-­business) that 
have signed the Global Compact are located in Europe, and this is followed 
by organisations in the Americas.
GLOBAL COMPACT REPORTING INITIATIVES
Communication on Progress and Communication on Engagement
Organisations that have signed the Global Compact commit to publicly 
report every year on their progress regarding the ten principles. This com-
munication on progress (COP) ought to be disclosured to ­stakeholders 
(consumers, investors, employees, etc.), and it is a mechanism to be 
accountable and to demonstrate commitment to advance towards broader 
UN development goals. COPs also should be submitted and posted on the 
UN Global Compact’s website, therefore building an increasing repository 
of corporate practices. Also, the Global Compact shares these COPs with 
financial markets through Bloomberg.

Based on a self-­assessment of the COP’s content, these are classified into 
UNGC Learner, UNGC Active and UNGC Advanced. On October 2013, 
the Global Compact introduced a Communication of Engagement (COE) 
for non-­business participant organisations. For non-­business organisations 
the COE ought to be submitted every two years (instead of annually).
Organisations that fail to communicate their annual progress are first 
labelled as ‘non-­communicating’ and then de-­listed from the Global 
Compact after 24 months, and they are publicly exposed. By May 2014, 
almost 4,500 organisations from all sectors and from every continent had 
been expelled.
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) is currently the most widely 
used voluntary corporate reporting framework for sustainability. In 
May 2010, at the Amsterdam Global Conference on Sustainability and 
Transparency, the UN Global Compact signed a partnership with GRI 
for aligning their initiatives to advance transparency and corporate 
responsibility through a joint encouragement to companies to increase 
their sustainability commitments. GRI’s framework provides companies 
a structure for their annual Communication of Progress (COP), but 
also integrating other dimensions of sustainability, thereby enhancing 
the value of the COP. GRI was founded in 1997 in Boston, and it was 
pioneered by the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economics 
(CERES) and the Tellus Institute. The initial aim of GRI was to provide 
a multi-­stakeholder accountability mechanism for companies’ respon-
sible environmental behaviour. This objective was amplified to other 
sustainability dimensions, including social, economic and governance 
issues. The first version of GRI was launched in 2000, then in 2002 the 
second-­generation guidelines (known as G2) were presented at the World 
Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and embraced by 
the United Nations. In 2006, the third generation (G3) was launched, 
and it has a particular emphasis on strategic alliances with the UN 
Global Compact, the Organisation for Economic Co-­operation and 
Development (OECD), the United Nations Environment Programme 
(UNEP), and the International Standards Office (ISO). G3 took into 
consideration the development of a consultancy process involving over 
3,000 business and civil society experts. Furthermore, G3 proposed 
sector-­specific guidelines and provided educational and training support 
to potential reporters. In 2011, G3.1 was proposed; it included guidance 
on reporting gender equity, community engagement and human rights 
performance.

The UN Global Compact    ­135
In May 2013, the fourth generation of GRI Sustainability Reporting 
Guidelines (G4) was launched. In order to increase the possibilities for 
cross-­organisational comparisons, G4 includes potentially transferable 
international metrics on sustainability. The specific difference of the G4 in 
relation with previous versions of the GRI is its emphasis on the import­
ance of materiality. This implies that organisations, in order to achieve 
their organisational objectives and increase their impact on society, should 
focus their sustainability reports on those issues that are material to their 
business and their strategic stakeholders.
PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONSIBLE MANAGEMENT 
EDUCATION (PRME)
The Global Compact acknowledges that in order to ensure a future genera-
tion of managers aware of sustainability and social responsibility issues, 
higher education institutions should be voluntarily involved, as they ‘help 
shape the attitudes and behaviours of business leaders thought business 
education, research, management development programmes, training, 
and other pervasive, but less tangible, activities, such as the spread and 
­advocacy of new values and ideas.’41
The PRME standards were first developed in 2007 by an interna-
tional task force of deans from business schools in the United States, 
Latin America, the Middle East and Europe, and international academic 
institutions (Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business 
(AACSB), European Foundation for Management Development (EDMD), 
the Aspen Institute Business and Society Programme, European Academy 
of Business and Society (EABIS), Globally Responsible Leadership 
Initiative (GRLI), and Net Impact) together with the UN Global 
Compact supported the drafting of the final document. UN Secretary-­
General Ban ­Ki-­moon hailed the initiative, declaring, ‘The Principles for 
Responsible Management Education have the capacity to take the case for 
universal values and business into classrooms on every continent.’
PRME is a ‘global UN-­supported initiative whose mission is to inspire 
and champion responsible management education, research leadership 
globally.’42 It consists of six Principles:

including more than one-­third of the Financial Times’ top 100 business

CONCLUSION
The importance of the UN Global Compact is understood through the 
successful corporate engagement with its initiatives. Bandi43 describes this 
engagement as follows:
In the last two decades the corporate sector has started to play a growing role 
in international development. The separation between business and the United 
Nations has become less significant. One expression of this evolution is the 
United Nations Global Compact.44

Bandi goes on to outline some criticisms of the Global Compact, 
­including the following:
●
●
UN Global Compact would only provide a superficial contribution 
to development, but not touch the unequal structures of the system.
●
●
It rather serves as a PR tool and helps to disguise the true goal of 
private enterprise, which is profit making. The UN serves thus as a 
‘bluewashing’ tool.
●
●
A main criticism concerning the non-binding character of member-
ship. There is neither serious monitoring nor any kind of sanctions. 
In 2004 less than 60% surveyed reported taking any action in compli-
ance with the ten principles.
●
●
The Global Compact is also seen as a break with the traditional 
­position of the UN on issues of economic policy.
●
●
The UN had the role of an actor apart and operated a non-­
interventionist policy. With the direct involving of the UN in the 
corporate sector’s activities, the UN would thus loose this privileged 
position, which contributed largely to the legitimacy it gained, also 
from developing countries.
●
●
This might have contributed to deterioration in the UN’s reputation 
and make the UN a less reliable partner for NGOs and other part-
ners particularly in developing countries.
●
●
The rapprochement would also bring up a new power relationship 
between the corporate sector and the UN that results in a weakening 
of the UN.45
These criticisms notwithstanding, the UN Global Compact can be seen 
as a success. This chapter outlined the significance of the Global Compact 
within a number of areas of operation. This included a discussion of the 
Global Compact’s origins, key participants and its principal signatories. 
The chapter went on to outline the distinction in contributions between 
business and non-­business participants in the UNGC. In addition, an 
understanding of the commitments of senior management to the Compact 
was presented to demonstrate the UNGC’s government structures.
Moreover, the extent of Global Compact members’ engagement with 
corporate social responsibility issues such as environmental protection, 
human rights and social issues was presented. In addition to presenting a 
discussion of the United Nation’s role in developing the UN Compact, the 
interaction between the UN and key stakeholders from both business and

non-­business sectors was outlined. An account of the 10 Principles was

Ultimately, the significance of networks developed among the UN

standing of the Compact’s potential for success in establishing global 
development projects based on integrity within a spirit of partnership and

The Equator Principles and the ‘Business and Human Rights Debate’5.  The Equator Principles and the ‘Business 
and Human Rights Debate’: hype or 
hope?
Manuel Wörsdörfer1
1.  INTRODUCTION
The Equator Principles (EPs) are officially described as a voluntary and self-­
regulatory finance-­industry benchmark in the project-­finance sector. In par-
ticular, they are characterized as a ‘credit-­risk-­management framework for 
determining, assessing, and managing socio-­environmental risk in project-­
finance transactions.’2 The EPs apply globally to four financial products: (1) 
Project finance with total project capital costs exceeding US$10 million, (2) 
project-­finance advisory services, (3) project-­related corporate loans and (4) 
bridge loans. The EPs are based on the International Finance Corporation’s 
Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability (IFC PS) 
and the World Bank Group’s Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines. 
As of September 2016, the EPs have been adopted by 84 Equator Principles 
Financial Institutions (EPFIs) from 35 countries covering over 70 per cent of 
international project-­finance debt in emerging markets.3
On 4 June 2013, the EP-­Association (EPA) celebrated the formal launch 
of the third generation of the EPs (EPIII) and at the same time the tenth 
anniversary of the EPs. The two major innovations of EPIII are, first, the 
intended fight against global warming, that is, the most recent version of 
the EPs aimed at environmental stewardship and ecological sustainabil-

strives for social sustainability which entails the respect of the rights of 
project-­affected communities and other stakeholders such as Civil Society 
Organizations (CSOs) and NGOs. Projects financed ‘under the EPs’ require 
a stakeholder dialogue either in the form of ‘Informed Consultation and 
Participation’ or in the form of ‘Free, Prior and Informed Consent’ – given 
that indigenous peoples are affected by a particular project.
But what does the reference to the Ruggie-­framework and the incor-
poration of the UNGP into the EP-­framework imply? Which practical 
consequences follow from that link? Which institutional strengths and 
weaknesses do the EPs exhibit? This chapter reviews the recent ‘Business 
and Human Rights’ (BHR) debate and analyzes the EPs from business 
(ethics) and human rights perspectives. There is a substantial need for 
improving the EPs, especially, in terms of human rights protection and 
realization. In particular, the current ‘human rights minimalism’4 of the 
EPs – focusing solely on the negative duty to respect while neglecting 
positive duties to protect and realize human rights – needs to be overcome, 
e.g., by introducing (more) mandatory and legally binding elements into 
the EP-­framework and by strengthening the governance-­mechanisms of 
the EPs and its association. The chapter reviews potential reform steps that 
should be taken to ‘harden’ this soft law transnational governance regime 
and to move towards a positive and leverage-­based CSR-­concept.
The remainder of the chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 elabor­
ates the main characteristics of the ‘post-­Westphalian’ and transnational 
world order. It is this ‘post-­national constellation’ which sets up the stage 
for the EPs as a voluntary and self-­regulatory private governance initiative. 
Section 3 gives an overview of the key terminology of the BHR-­debate, 
that is, it picks up the distinctions between negative and positive duties as 
well as ‘influence as impact’ versus ‘influence as leverage’. Section 4 ana-
lyzes the EPs from a BHR-­perspective. Here, the main institutional short-
comings of EPIII as a mainly negative and impact-­based CSR-­concept 
lacking adequate governance structures are revealed. Section 5 proposes 
reform steps which should be adopted to overcome the weaknesses of the 
EP-­framework and to further strengthen EPIII in terms of human rights 
protection. The chapter argues that the EPA should integrate (more) 
mandatory and legally binding elements into the EP-­framework and move 
towards a positive impact-­ and leverage-­based CSR-­concept. The chapter 
ends with a summary of the main findings.

2.  BEYOND THE PUBLIC-­PRIVATE DIVIDE: THE 
‘POSTNATIONAL CONSTELLATION’5
In recent years, a gradual transition from the traditional, nation-­state based 
Westphalian setting towards a transnational ‘post-­Westphalian world 
order’6 has occurred. This ‘shift from government to [post-­Westphalian] 
governance’7 is characterized by the following features:
1.	 (Partial) disempowerment and erosion of the regulatory power of the 
nation-­state;
2.	 Fragmentation of legal-­political authority (coexistence of polycentric 
and hybrid governance regimes);
3.	 Existence of regulatory or governance gaps, in particular in trans­
national regulations;
4.	 Increasing 
ambiguity 
of 
borders 
and 
jurisdictions 
(de-­ 
territorialization);
5.	 Blurring of the separation between private and public spheres; and
6.	 Politicization of non-­state actors.8
The global politico-­economic arena is characterized by the coexistence 
and interplay of state and non-­state, public and private actors, and the 
presence of intermediaries such as non-­state agencies. Furthermore, dif-
ferent types of regulations exist side by side: National and international, 
nation-­state and market-­based, public and private, centralized and decen-
tralized, mandatory and voluntary, formal and informal, hierarchical and 
non-­hierarchical, hard-­ and soft-­law regulations.9 These hybrid and often

de-­territorialized public–private orderings overlap, intersect and collide 
with each other.10 Zumbansen speaks in this regard of ‘transnational legal 
pluralism’ and ‘polycentric governance regimes’ as the new world order 
is occupied by a plurality of transnational governance systems and new 
forms of political–legal regulation ‘above and beyond the nation-­state’.11 
Transnational regulatory regimes are thus populated by a multitude of 
norm-­making authorities. Public and private, state and non-­state  rule-­
producers and norm-­creating actors engage and interact in the formula-
tion, implementation and enforcement of (in)formal norms.12
This transition from a Westphalian to a post-­Westphalian world order 
is accompanied by a fundamental transformation of the role of (hard) law 
as well as a transformation of the role of the nation-­state: There is a shift 
in law-­making from public mandate to private (voluntary) self-­regulation 
and a transition from formal rule-­creation in politically embedded state 
legal systems towards a system of specialized transnational law13 regimes. 
Law outside the nation-­state and within dispersed and fragmented spaces 
of norm-­production, that is, ‘post-­regulatory’ or ‘reflexive law’, transcends 
a nation-­based understanding of law.14
Moreover, the state and other regulatory actors are undergoing dramatic 
changes with regards to their respective regulatory capacities, functions 
and instruments. The state is far from diminishing; there is no retreat, 
demise or death of the nation-­state. Rather, the role of the state has 
changed – from the primary or exclusive author of binding norms to being 
one among a group of non-­state actors involved in the norm-­generation 
and enforcement process. Traditional, state-­originating and formal pro-
cesses of norm-­production are transformed in favor of increasingly 
decentralized and denationalized processes of norm-­setting by different

norm-­creators. This implies transnational, multi-­level processes of norm-­
generation and enforcement and a fundamental contestation and erosion 
of the boundaries between state and non-­state actors. The regulatory state 
is transformed into a moderating, enabling and supervising state15 within a 
knowledge-­based and globalized world economy-­society.16
The role of non-­state actors has also undergone fundamental transfor-
mations. In particular, Multinational Corporations (MNCs) gradually 
slip into the role of ‘primary agents of global justice’;17 they are no longer 
mere addressees of the regulation, but they are also (co-­) authors of the 
regulation. Moreover, MNCs act as de facto (quasi-­) political actors,18 
rule-­makers19 and standard-­setters, that is, they act in (quasi-­) governmen-
tal roles,20 acquire (quasi-­) government-­like powers and exercise (quasi-­) 
government-­like functions such as the provision of public goods.21
3.  THE ‘BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS’ DEBATE
Within the BHR-­debate two distinctions play an important role, that is, 
the distinctions between negative versus positive duties and ‘influence 
as impact’ versus ‘influence as leverage’. The following paragraphs give 
an overview of these keywords. The chapter applies these insights of the

BHR-­debate directly to the EPs and critically evaluates the EPs from a 
BHR-­perspective.
3.1  Negative versus Positive Duties22
Human rights obligations can be divided into the negative duties to respect 
and the positive duties to protect and realize human rights:23 Negative 
duties are often couched in terms of avoiding, preventing or minimiz-
ing. With regard to human rights, this implies that businesses should not 
infringe on the rights of others; they should ‘do no harm’ and refrain 
from violating human rights. The major negative duty they have is the 
responsibility to respect human rights and to obey the human rights laws 
in their daily operations; yet, they are not obliged to actively promote the 
­protection of human rights.
Positive duties, to the contrary, are couched in terms of supporting, 
improving, fulfilling or contributing. They refer to the proactive realiza-
tion, promotion and protection of human rights. These duties to protect 
and realize human rights are particularly expected from those institutions 
which are equipped with superior powers, capabilities and/or leverages.24 
They, thus, refer to state and non-­state actors and in particular to MNCs 
which have unique capabilities and leverage-­opportunities to protect and 
realize human rights.
3.2  Impact versus Leverage
The second relevant distinction within the BHR-­debate is the one between 
‘influence as impact’ and ‘influence as leverage’.25 Influence as impact 
refers to the effects and outcomes which are (in) directly caused by an 
institution’s decisions and activities, while influence as leverage refers to 
an organization’s ability to influence other organizations’ decisions and 
­activities through its business relationships.

The Equator Principles and the ‘Business and Human Rights Debate’    ­145
The concept of ‘Sphere of Influence’ (SOI)26 may illustrate the notion 
of influence as leverage: SOI assumes that the business relations of a 
company are organized in concentric circles, that is, ‘a series of nested 
circles radiating outward from the organization’s own workplace’.27 The 
workplace of the company is in the center of this network of relationship. 
The other concentric circles are moving outward – seen from the work-
place as the center – to the supply-­ and value-­chain, the industry branch, 
the marketplace, the government and civil society. SOI assumes that the 
degree of influence of a company diminishes from one circle to the other 
and with increased distance from the center.28
3.3  Four Varieties of CSR
The combination of the two distinctions – negative versus positive duties 
and ‘influence as impact’ versus ‘influence as leverage’ – yields four varie-
ties of influence-­based CSR:29
1.	 Negative impact-­based responsibility: A company has the obligation 
to avoid contributing to negative socio-­environmental impacts in its 
operative business;
2.	 Negative leverage-­based responsibility: A company has the duty to 
make use of its leverage, that is, its opportunities to influence business 
partners in their decision-­making with the aim to avoid or minimize 
negative socio-­environmental effects;
3.	 Positive impact-­based responsibility: A company has the obligation to 
consciously and purposefully contribute to positive socio-­ecological 
impacts;
4.	 Positive leverage-­based responsibility: A company has the duty to 
make use of its leverage with the aim to increase or maximize positive 
­socio-­environmental effects among their business partners.

3.4  Corporate Complicity
Corporate complicity in human rights abuses is defined as ‘aiding or abet-
ting’ in the violation of human rights committed by a third-­party actor such 
as host governments or suppliers and contractors in the corporation’s value-­
chain.30 A company acts as accomplices in human rights violations ‘if it 
authorizes, tolerates, or knowingly ignores human rights abuses committed 
by an entity associated with it’.31 Clapham/Jerbi and Wettstein distinguish 
four categories of corporate complicity in human rights violations:32
1.	 Direct corporate complicity: the corporation directly and causally 
­contributes to specific human rights violations;
2.	 Indirect corporate complicity: the corporate activities support, in 
a general way, the ability of the perpetrator to carry out wide-
spread and systematic human rights violations. Indirect complicity is 
usually divided into two sub-­categories, namely beneficial and silent 
complicity;
3.	 Beneficial complicity refers to a corporation which knowingly benefits 
from human rights abuses committed by a third party;
4.	 Silent complicity refers to the refusal of a company to speak out and 
to make use of its leverage-­opportunities to influence socio-­political 
change.
There are several constitutive requirements which need to be fulfilled for 
an agent to be guilty of silent complicity: the omission and legitimization 
requirement, the criterion of influence and power; the criterion of absence 
of fear and coercion; the scale of human rights violations criterion.33 
Given that all these conditions are fulfilled, the corporation has a posi-
tive (moral) duty to speak out against the abuses of human rights, to help 
protecting victims of human rights violations34 and to foster socio-­political 
change in oppressive and authoritarian regimes.

The Equator Principles and the ‘Business and Human Rights Debate’    ­147
In other words, (corporate) silence in cases of severe and ­systematic 
human rights violations is to be interpreted as moral support or 
­encouragement for the perpetrator or at least as a sign of acquiescence. 
Not speaking out against the wrongdoings done to human beings equals 
the implicit approval and toleration of the wrongdoings by a potent agent. 
As such, silence is not morally neutral.35 Due to the moral nature of human 
rights as universal moral norms or (hyper-­) norms of global justice,36 a 
positive duty to speak out exists (positive leverage based responsibility) – 
of which more later.
3.5  Equator Principles and Human Rights
The latest generation of the EPs (EPIII) consists of two pillars: eco-
logical sustainability (fight against climate change) and the respect for 
human rights. With regards to human rights, EPIII explicitly acknowl-
edges Ruggie’s PRR-­framework and the UNGP.37 Additionally, the EPs 
in­directly38 acknowledge the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the 
International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, the core ILO-­conventions and the Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
Within the EP-­framework, the respect for human rights is interlinked 
with the inclusion of project-­affected communities, especially indigen­
ous peoples, but also NGOs and CSOs in decision-­making processes. 
Principle 5 of the EPs is designed to establish an ongoing and ­culturally 
appropriate stakeholder engagement, consultation, and participation 
process. Information has to be made readily and publicly available to the 
35  Wettstein (n 4), 756.

37  Direct references to the Ruggie-­framework can be found in the EP-­preamble 
(EPA, ‘The Equator Principles’ (2013) <http://equator-­principles.com/index.php/
ep3/ep3>, 2); paragraph 3 of IFC PS 1 and paragraph 2 of IFC PS 7 (IFC, 
‘Performance Standards’ [2012] <www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/115482804a0255
db96fbffd1a5d13d27/PS_English_2012_Full-­Document.pdf?MOD=AJPERES>); 
IFC’s Guidance Note 1 (IFC, ‘Guidance Notes’ [2012] <www.ifc.org/wps/

(Thun Group of Banks, ‘UNGP’ [2013] <www.csrandthelaw.com/wp-­content/

38  No direct references to these conventions can be found in the EPs them-
selves. Yet, the IFC’s Guidance Notes 1, 2 and 7 contain several references to the 
aforementioned declarations (n 37). Since the EPs are based on the IFC PS the 
EPFIs are also bound by these conventions.

affected communities in their local languages. The disclosure of informa-
tion should occur as early as possible in the assessment process – ideally 
within the planning stage and before construction commences – and on 
an ongoing basis. Project-­affected communities must have the right to 
participate in decision-­making. Their voices have to be heard, and the 
interests and needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable groups have to be 
taken into consideration. The whole stakeholder engagement process 
should be free from external manipulation, interference, coercion and 
intimidation. Projects with adverse impacts on aboriginal peoples require 
their ‘Free, Prior and Informed Consent’ (FPIC). This consent, however, 
does not create any veto rights nor does it require unanimity. Nevertheless, 
FPIC aims at reaching a consensus and the term ‘consent’ goes beyond the 
­previous consultation and disclosure procedure.
Thus, the respect for human rights, together with environmental steward-
ship, is at the center of EPIII. It is remarkable – and in a way typical – that 
it took exactly ten years until the human rights terminology got introduced 
for the first time into the EP-­framework. Only EPIII contains direct refer-
ences to corporate human rights policy and corporate Human Rights Due 
Diligence (HRDD). As such, EPIII has to be regarded as a major step 
forward compared with EPII in terms of respect for human rights.
Yet, the current EP-­version is in great need of improvement: The term 
‘human rights’ is mainly mentioned in the preamble and the exhibit; HRDD 
is mentioned only once and with the addition ‘may be appropriate’,39 while 
the terms ‘human rights impact assessment’ and ‘human rights action 
plan’ are lacking. Furthermore, EPIII refers only once to gender issues and 
women’s rights (tellingly, in exhibit II), and there is no explicit and direct 
reference to the major human rights conventions and declarations (only 
the IFC PS refer to these).
Most important, a huge gap between theory and practice exists. In 
general, the EPs (and other extra-­legal CSR-­initiatives) are accused of 
being a PR-­tool, a ‘green-­washing’ instrument, an appeasement strategy 
or a ‘paper tiger’, that is, high-­minded commitments on paper which fail 
to be enforced in practice. Indeed, when taking a closer look at the EPs, 
it becomes apparent that the governance mechanisms are fundamentally 
inadequate. Up to today, effective enforcement, monitoring and sanction-
ing mechanisms are missing (which will be discussed more below). Thus, 
it comes as no surprise that theory and practice fall apart. In practice, 
­socio-­environmental and human rights standards are (still) massively 
abused and undermined by the involved MNCs; e.g., EPFIs and their 
39  EPA (n 37), 5.

clients (still) engage in (funding) ‘dirty projects’ or ‘dodgy deals’; that 
is, projects which involve serious socio-­environmental and human rights 
standards violations.40
3.6  The EPs’ ‘Human Rights Minimalism’
It has already been pointed out that the EPs explicitly acknowledge and 
refer to the Ruggie-­framework. This framework states that the protection 
of human rights is the primary duty of nation-­states (state duty to protect). 
In other words, nation-­states are considered to be the main duty-­bearers 
and trustees when it comes to human rights protection. According to 
Ruggie, international human rights laws apply primarily to state actors. 
Thus, any positive duty to protect and realize human rights is part of the 
domain of nation-­states.
The baseline requirement for all companies in all contexts requires cor-
porations to not infringe on the rights of others and to comply with the 
(human rights) legislation, that is, legal compliance.41 Corporations, thus, 
mainly need to fulfill the negative duty to avoid causing or contributing 
to adverse human rights impacts (corporate responsibility to respect). All 
proactive and positive measures which aim at exercising leverage to protect 
and realize human rights and which go beyond this negative duty to respect 
human rights are regarded as an optional or voluntary matter of corporate 
philanthropy, not as a legal obligation.42 Ruggie’s PRR-­framework with 
its state-­sovereignty assumption, state-­centrism and nation-­state-­based 
­perspective is thus to be classified as a traditional Westphalian approach 
40  Examples include the Baku-­Tbilisi-­Ceyhan oil-­pipeline project; the Sakhalin 
II oil-­ and gas-­project; the Galilee Basin and Abbott Point coal-­ and gas-­project; 
the Orion Paper-­Pulp Mill case in Uruguay; the Belo Monte Dam in the Brazilian 
Amazon; fracking, tar and oil sands mining in Canada; the Bristol Bay controversy 
in Alaska; the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf of Mexico; 
the Marlin and Fenix mining projects in Guatemala; and the Pascua Lama mining 
project in Argentina and Chile. The latter project is of particular importance since 
two Equator Banks (Ex-­Im Bank and Export Development Canada) decided 
not to finance the project due to NGO-­pressure and the clear violations of the 
EPs, including serious human rights violations committed against the Diaguita 
Indigenous community. In October 2013, Barrick Gold has decided to temporarily 
suspend construction activities at Pascua-­Lama. This case illustrates that the EPs 
have the potential to make a difference on the ground; yet, most EPFIs do not 
make (sufficient) use of their leverage over their clients and the EPs still lack proper 
governance-­mechanisms that could help to prevent these kind of ‘dodgy deals’.

(the political (and leverage-­based) responsibilities of MNCs play only a 
minor role in here). By tendency, it can be labeled as a negative and impact-­
based CSR-­concept, which means that the company’s main responsibility 
is to avoid causing or contributing to human rights abuses and violations.43 
Ruggie himself is quite skeptical when it comes to the concepts of posi-
tive and/or leverage-­based CSR44 (this is one of the main reasons for his 
­rejection of the UN-­Norms and the SOI-concept).45
Since the EPs explicitly acknowledge and refer to the PRR-­framework,46 
they can also be classified as a negative and impact-­based CSR-­concept, 
one which stands in contrast to a positive and leverage-­based CSR-­
concept. Furthermore, since the EPs are built on Ruggie’s framework, they 
also face similar points of criticism as the PRR-­framework does (this is 
even more the case since the EPs fall in several regards behind the Ruggie-­
framework, e.g., in terms of the third pillar of the UNGP, that is, [non-­] 
judicial remedy ­mechanisms).47
This chapter argues against the EPs’ ‘human rights minimalism’, their 
state-­centered perspective and bias towards corporate voluntarism.48 It 
argues that a moral necessity to overcome this bias towards ­voluntariness 
43  To be precise, the Ruggie framework consists of negative and positive duty 
elements. It thus holds an intermediate position between negative and positive 
CSR-­concepts. The main reason for classifying it here as a negative (and impact-­
based) CSR-­concept is twofold. First, the negative CSR-­elements inside the 
Ruggie framework (clearly) outweigh the positive ones (cf. Ruggie’s emphasis on 
preventing and mitigating adverse human rights impacts; avoid causing or contrib-
uting to negative human rights impacts; avoid infringing on the rights of others; 
legal compliance; etc.) (this, however, does not imply that positive CSR-­elements 
are completely absent, to the contrary, think of Ruggie’s discussion of [non-­] judi-
cial remediation of corporate-­related harm as well as the HRDD requirements; 
the PRR-­framework thus goes beyond the mere notion of ‘doing no harm’ and 
minimum legal obligations). Second, a major element of a positive and leverage-­
based CSR-­concept is missing; that is, the notion of leverage: A detailed and 
qualitative examination of the leverage-­based responsibilities of MNCs is lacking 
in Ruggie’s recent book Just Business and in the UNGP (in here, only short refer-
ences to companies ending their business relationships are included). Moreover, 
the UNGP refer to the term ‘leverage’ only a few times, exceptionally in paragraph 
19b, while Ruggie’s Just Business refers to it mainly in the context of nation-­states, 
but not in the context of (multinational) corporations.

exists: What is needed is an extension of direct, morally grounded and 
­positive human rights obligations for corporations as well as a push 
towards (more) non-­voluntary rules for state AND non-­state actors.49 In 
particular, two arguments speak in favor of moving towards (more) man-
datory and legally-­binding rules for MNCs (‘hardening the soft law’) and 
positive, impact-­ and leverage-­based responsibilities:50
First, the EP-­framework seems to view MNCs as private and apolit­
ical entities as does the traditional Westphalian world view.51 Yet, the 
­political nature of human rights responsibilities in a post-­Westphalian 
setting clashes with this perceived apolitical (private) nature of the 
corporation.52 Recent research in the fields of political CSR and trans-
national legal theory have shown the gradual politicization of MNCs 
as well as the gradual shift in business–government–society relations.53 
Foucault54 and other proponents of ‘governmentality studies’ speak of 
a ‘post-­regulatory model’55 in which private (soft law) self-­regulation is 
amending and complementing the traditional governmental (hard law) 
regulation. These new forms of (transnational) governance regimes come 
with a ‘shift from government to governance’, that is, various state and 
non-­state actors form coalitions and public-­private partnerships and 
the ‘governmentality regulatory network’ is emerging: The traditional 
top-­down government regulation approach is weakened, governmental 
functions are outsourced towards non-­state actors,56 and a far-­reaching 
diffusion of powers, rights and responsibilities occurs. New governance 
agents such as MNCs, NGOs and CSOs appear on the stage. They 
often transcend national boundaries and make use of market forces to 
achieve their socio-­environmental goals.57 These ‘governance without 
­government’ regimes58 are followed by a new division of labor associated 
with regulation between private and public actors (state, civil society and 
market sectors).
Especially, MNCs take over certain roles and functions previously

ascribed to nation-­states. This is particularly true regarding the ‘protec-
tion, facilitation and enabling of citizen’s rights’.59 In terms of social and 
cultural rights, corporations function as providers; that is, they supply 
individuals with social services. In terms of civil rights, corporations func-
tion as ­enablers, in that they are able to capacitate or constrain citizen’s 
civil rights. In terms of political rights, corporations fulfill a channeling 
role, that is, they function as an ‘additional conduit for the exercise of 
­individual’s political rights’.60 Thus, MNCs take a growing pivotal (quasi-­) 
political role in granting and facilitating major rights linked to citizenship; 
they are major players in the arena of political rights.61 In short, MNCs are 
not only de facto rule-­makers, standard-­setters and (co-­) authors of regula-
tions, they are also (quasi-­) political actors that assume (quasi-­) govern­
mental roles and exercise (quasi-­) government-­like functions.
It is this heightened political status of MNCs which justifies and 
requires enlarged moral duties. Shifting powers must necessarily come 
with shifting moral responsibilities and obligations. Political authority and 
power should thus imply public responsibilities62 and in particular a politi-
cal or regulatory co-­responsibility of MNCs.63 The moral and political 
obligations entail more than doing no harm: MNCs must use their powers 
for the common good (e.g., in the sense of human rights protection). The 
‘argument of symmetry’ states that powers, authorities and rights should 
imply duties, obligations and liabilities.64 To put it differently: Leverage – 
understood here in terms of a company’s size, scale of operations, profits, 
financial and human resources, strategic position in certain networks, 
privileged access to elites, etc.65 – is equal to responsibility, and the more 
leverage, means the more responsibility. In other words, the larger the 
company, the larger the SOI is likely to be.66
Second, the EPs’ human rights ‘voluntarism’ also clashes with the moral 
nature of human rights.67 Human rights are considered fundamental moral 
rights or entitlements inherent to and constituent for all human beings 
(absolute and categorical character of human rights as moral rights).68

The Equator Principles and the ‘Business and Human Rights Debate’    ­153
They, thus, refer to the principle of the fundamental moral equality and 
equal worth of all human beings as humans.69 Furthermore, human rights 
flow from human dignity and they are rooted in it;70 that is, they are essential 
for a self-­determined, autonomous and dignified life in freedom. It is this 
moral nature of human rights and the fact that they are rooted in human 
dignity71 which justifies their status as universal,72 egalitarian, indivisible, 
inalienable, undeniable and unconditional moral rights. Human rights exist 
a priori, that is, antecedent to and independent of nation-­states and legal 
laws: They have (partial) legal standing, as they find their expression in stat-
utes and laws which are enacted by legislative and juridical authorities. They 
are embodied in national constitutions and statues and/or as part of proc-
lamations by international institutions or political bodies, which is the legal 
dimension of human rights as juridical rights. Yet, human rights are not 
contingent on legal rights; they contain a claim to universal moral validity.73 
Thus, these kinds of moral obligations74 outreach legal obligations.75
The status of human rights as moral rights rules out any form of moral 
arbitrariness, discretion and voluntariness (e.g., in the form of ­corporate 
charity or philanthropy). In other words: Human rights are not a matter 
of voluntary ‘compliance’. Thus, (multinational) corporations have direct 
negative and positive moral obligations to unconditionally respect, protect 
AND realize human rights (these human rights responsibilities are inde-
pendent of the legal requirements in the corporation’s countries of 
operation).76 Businesses are direct duty-­bearers, and should thus be held 
directly liable for their (complicity in) human rights violations.77 To put

it differently: States are not the exclusive and only bearers of positive 
human rights obligations. Corporations’ (legal and) moral duties must go 
beyond ‘do no harm’ and they must do more than merely respect human 
rights.78 Their scope of responsibility also includes a positive duty to 
protect and realize human rights, a universal duty79 which has commonly 
been ascribed only to nation-­states. Thus, due to their political authority 
and power (MNCs as (quasi-­) political actors and de facto rule-­makers 
and (co-­) authors of regulations) and due to the moral nature of human 
rights, (multi­national) corporations (including (EP)FIs) have positive and 
leverage-­based responsibilities to fulfill; e.g., a duty to protect victims of 
human rights abuses, in particular when a humanitarian emergency occurs; 
a positive duty to speak out; a duty to promote human rights-­compatible 
institutions in home and host countries; and a duty to foster politico-­
economic change (inside and outside the supply-­ and value-­chain).
In summary, MNCs as (quasi-­) political authorities bear political 
responsibilities and direct human rights obligations and they have duties 
to respect, protect AND realize human rights. The tripartite typology of 
human rights obligations80 is thus valid for state and non-­state actors, and 
companies have to fulfill negative and positive human rights duties.
The EPA is well advised to take the aforementioned critique seriously: 
What is needed from the BHR-perspective of this chapter is a push towards 
(more) mandatory and legally binding rules for businesses, particularly 
with respect to human rights protection.81 Additionally, an impact-­ and 
leverage-­based CSR-­concept including positive human rights obligations 
for corporations and a corporate human rights activism and advocacy 
campaign82 is needed. This comprehensive impact-­ and leverage-­based 
CSR-­concept shall aim at making use of one’s leverage/organization’s 
capacity to influence other parties’ decisions and activities, especially those 
which are part of the supply-­ and value-­chain. This chapter, thus, argues 
to move beyond the current BHR-­status quo. The overall aim must be to 
overcome the EPs’ (and other CSR-­initiatives’) bias towards voluntariness 
(‘going  beyond voluntariness’) and to argue for a positive impact-­ and 
leverage-­based CSR-­concept. The human rights ‘chapter’ of the EPs 
(including the Thun Group’s working paper) is a necessary step in the right 
direction, yet it does not go far enough. What is needed is a comprehensive, 
positive leverage-­based CSR-­concept, one which holds MNCs directly

­accountable for their actions and establishes positive human rights obliga-
tions for (multi­national) corporations. In its current version, however, the 
EPs are not readily equipped for a positive ­leverage-­based CSR-­conception. 
Thus, the following section analyzes the various shortcomings of EPIII and 
points out necessary reform steps that need to be implemented to (further) 
strengthen the EP-­framework (and to bring positive impacts and value crea-
tion, e.g., in the sense of a proper human rights protection).
4.  A CRITICAL BUSINESS-­ETHICAL EVALUATION 
OF THE EPS
It has already been pointed out that many EPFIs still engage in so-­called 
dodgy deals and that they fund ‘dirty projects’. The reasons for these 
ethically dubious deals and the apparent gap between theory and practice 
have to be seen in the inadequate and ineffective governance mechanisms. 
Among the main shortcomings and continued deficiencies of the latest 
version of the EPs and (its association) are the lack of accountability 
and liability, the existing exit-­door strategies, the lack of monitoring and 
screening, the lack of implementation and enforcement, and the lack of 
sanctioning-­mechanisms.
For example, the Disclaimer and the Governance Rules of the EPs83 
state that the EPs do not create any rights or liabilities. As such, they 
ensure that there are no mandatory obligations or direct punitive actions 
that can arise from the EPs. The EP-­framework is a legally non-­binding 
governance system which relies solely on voluntary self-­regulation and 
self-­enforcement. Minimum entry requirements and absolute performance 
standards are lacking. Furthermore, clear, verifiable metrics that are trans-
parently and independently monitored are absent.84 In short, no adequate 
governance mechanism exists which could ensure external and internal 
accountability and liability.
Moreover, lots of loopholes and grey areas exist which allow for circum-
venting the EPs in myriad ways. The EPs are vaguely, even ambiguously, 
formulated, leaving enough discretionary leeway for diverging interpre-
tations and exit-­door strategies. The language used is often declaratory 
rather than compulsory; some principles are conditional in nature, others

contain mere recommendations. The EPs are mainly written in ‘should’ 
not in ‘shall’ language, which implies no legal obligations. As a conse-
quence, borrowers and lenders are able to circumvent the contractual 
obligations of the EPs to avoid being classified as high risk.85 Banks can 
redefine their project finance activities as representing something else, such 
as corporate or export finance and project financiers take the backdoor 
option and classify their projects as category B or C to avoid a stricter 
A-­classification.86 Lastly, EPFIs can provide loans in different tranches to 
avoid the ­respective financial thresholds.
So far, EP-­compliance relies mainly on ‘passive’ monitoring.87 NGOs 
and CSOs function as watchdogs.88 In case of apparent non-­compliance, 
they might start ‘naming and shaming’ campaigns that might catch 
media attention and cause public outcry and negative reputational 
effects on the involved EPFIs and their clients. However, pro-­active and 
independent monitoring and control, and mandatory and ­transparent 
­third-­party assessment of compliance – e.g., in the form of an ­independent 
­EP-­ombudsperson  – are still missing. What is also lacking in EPIII 
are absolute performance standards and clear, verifiable metrics which 
are transparently monitored – both of which are a necessity for an 
impartial and independent verification of conformity. Finally, mandatory 
­grievance-­ and remedy-­mechanisms, which could help to address ineffec-
tive implementation and non-­compliance, are absent. In short, the EPs 
are a set of ­voluntary, legally non-­binding guidelines without appropriate 
­accountability, monitoring and auditing systems.
Furthermore, the self-­regulatory EP-­regime is rather ineffective since 
a credible deterrent (e.g., in the form of de-­listing and exclusion of non-­
compliant EPFIs) and formal sanctions are lacking. Enforcement, moni-
toring and sanctions belong together; they form an indissoluble triangle. 
In all three regards, the EPs lack effective governance mechanisms. The 
question which comes up with respect to sanctions is whether the EPs have 
enough legal bite to penalize institutions that fall behind their voluntary 
socio-­environmental commitments. Currently, EPFIs face only minor

sanctions, should they not comply with the EPs. Until today, only ‘naming 
and shaming’ campaigns might put EPFIs and their clients under pressure. 
NGO/CSO-­watchdogs have powerful positions when it comes to reputa-
tional pressure. They help to ensure that non-­state actors such as MNCs 
abide by their voluntary commitments and promises. Nevertheless, this 
passive and ex-­post way of monitoring (and sanctioning) is not sufficient 
to prevent ‘dodgy deals’.
5.  REFORM STEPS
To overcome the institutional shortcomings of the EPs and to move 
towards a positive impact-­ and leverage-­based CSR-­concept, reform steps 
are to be adopted at the micro- ­(level of the individual corporation includ-
ing project sponsors and developers), meso- ­(EPA-­level) and macro-­levels 
((trans-­) national level). The following paragraphs give an overview of the 
respective reform measures which should be adopted by EPFIs and/or 
their clients.
5.1  Micro-­level: EPFIs and Clients
5.1.1  Change in corporate culture
The ‘Spirit of the EPs’89 should not be restricted to project finance alone 
since it is only a small segment of multinational banks (it commonly 
accounts for up to 5 per cent of the overall turnover of major banks; 
as such, the EPs apply only to a small fraction of multinational bank’s 
total activities). The EP-­spirit should ideally be applied to all banking 
­activities  – including investment banking; that is, EPFIs should aim at 
‘going beyond project finance’.
The EP-­spirit should also be embedded throughout the whole organi-
zation. All levels and sectors of the organization should internalize it. 
For instance, socio-­environmental and human rights risk management 
and other CSR-­activities should be integrated into the company’s core 
businesses; a company’s existing risk-­management framework, decision-­
making and governance processes should be extended to also include 
ESG-­issues.
Furthermore, considerable resources are needed for organizational 
awareness-­raising, sensitizing and capacity-­building. Awareness-­raising 
and sensitizing must have the aim to ensure awareness of ESG-­issues and

responsibilities within the bank at all management levels and across all 
disciplines. Capacity-­building deals with building in-­house human rights-­
related knowledge and expertise such as knowledge about international 
laws and standards, knowledge about client, country, industry, company 
and asset as well as country-­ and sector-­specific ESG-­risks. It achieves this 
aim via staff and front-­line officer training, workshops (e.g., on evaluat-
ing human rights conflicts and ethical dilemmas), internal communica-
tion, experience and best-­practice sharing, feedback-­generation, outside 
­consultation, recruitment and budget allocation.
Of particular importance are the top-­level commitment and senior-­level 
approval: The CEO and other senior managers function as role models. 
Thus, leadership from the top is essential to embed respect for human 
rights throughout a company.
A change in the organizational culture should also affect the incentive 
structures and in particular, the bonus payment systems or compensation 
structures and packages which should be long-­term rather than ­short-­term 
oriented. So far, investment managers are judged according to their 
­quarterly or annual performance and not according to their multiple-­years 
performance.90
5.1.2  Human rights due diligence (HRDD)
Having a properly functioning HRDD (à la UNGP) which assesses the 
actual and potential human rights impacts of a company plays a major 
role. The aim of HRDD is to become aware of, identify, prevent, address 
and mitigate adverse human rights risks and impacts. HRDD requires the 
following elements:
●
●
Human rights policy (statement);
●
●
Human rights risk-­mapping, Human Rights Impact Assessment 
(HRIA) and Human Rights Action Plans (HRAP);91
●
●
Integration of the human rights perspective into corporate govern-
ance structures and corporate decision-­making and operational 
processes;
●
●
Performance tracking including auditing and monitoring; and
●
●
Periodic reporting.92

The Equator Principles and the ‘Business and Human Rights Debate’    ­159
What is essential from a human rights perspective is that all (!) human 
rights are relevant to HRDD (due to the fact that human rights are indivis-
ible) and that the human rights perspective is applied across all types of 
products and services and to all company levels. In terms of (EP)FIs, this 
includes retail and private banking, corporate and investment banking, 
and asset management. Additionally, HRDD should be carried out on an 
ongoing basis since human rights risks may change over time as operations 
and contexts evolve (change in human rights risk profile due to unforeseen 
events). It should also be adapted to the country-­ and sector-­specific risks. 
There is simply no one-­size-­fits-­all approach to HRDD since local legisla-
tion and human rights environments vary from region to region and sector 
to sector. HRDD is of particular importance in conflict zones, in sectors 
with strong human rights sensitivities and when vulnerable or marginalized 
groups such as indigenous peoples are affected.93
Potential human rights risks for banks occur, for example, when they 
provide products and services to governments and/or companies with a 
challenging human rights track record or projects in sensitive industries and 
locations. Here, banks should adopt a broader perspective on their human 
rights impacts. Besides focusing on their own adverse human rights risks and 
impacts which are directly caused through their own activities, they also need 
to take into account the potential adverse human rights effects on third-­party 
stakeholders and those risks and impacts which might be caused by their 
business partners (e.g., clients and other supply-­/value-­chain actors).
Many human rights impacts of (EP)FIs arise via the actions of their 
clients and can be addressed through influence, leverage and dialogue.94 
Here, it is decisive to make business partners aware of the corporation’s 
human rights expectations and requirements. What is needed is a commit-
ment from the client (and contractors and suppliers). The client should 
at least demonstrate conformity with the UNGP, e.g., via human rights 
policy, HRDD, operational-­level grievance mechanisms, reporting on 
human rights performance, adherence to (inter-­) national standards, and 
performance-­track record.95 Furthermore, human rights clauses should be 
integrated into business agreements and contracts. If significant human 
rights risks have been detected, the bank should agree on actions with the 
client and closely collaborate with it to address and mitigate these human 
rights risks and impacts. In (extreme) cases, the bank may opt out; that is, 
it should consider terminating the business relationship (exit option).

5.1.3  Stakeholder engagement
EPFIS and especially their clients should adhere to the principles laid 
down in the IFC PS: The IFC PS (standard 1), and the EPs (principle 5) 
ask for an encompassing and constant stakeholder dialogue process. 
Affected stakeholders must have the rights to information, consult­ation 
and participation (in decision-­making). The stakeholder engagement must 
take place in a ‘culturally appropriate way’; that is, information has to 
be made readily and publicly available to the affected groups in their 
local languages. The information disclosure should start as early as pos-
sible in the impact-­assessment process and operate on a continuous basis. 
Furthermore, the stakeholder dialogue process must be free from external 
coercion, interference, intimidation and manipulation.
The overall aim is to respect and protect the legitimate interests and needs 
of disadvantaged, marginalized and vulnerable (ethnic) groups. One essen-
tial element is thus FPIC; the stakeholder dialogue should ideally be based 
on the FPIC-­paradigm: FPIC and not the current Informed Consultation 
and Participation (ICP) paradigm should become the standard procedure 
for financing, managing and operating projects. FPIC should become man-
datory for all projects financed ‘under the EPs’, not only for those projects 
with adverse socio-­environmental impacts on indigenous peoples (‘moving 
beyond ICP’). Finally, to avoid ‘dirty projects’ de facto veto rights should be 
granted to affected communities in cases of serious socio-­environmental and 
human rights impacts. What is also needed is a clear-­cut rule for decision-­
making, e.g., a two-­thirds majority approval by affected communities.
5.1.4  Project-­level grievance, complaint and remedy mechanisms
In 2014, FMO, a Dutch development bank, became the first EP-­signatory 
to introduce an independent operational and project-­level grievance and 
complaints mechanism which allows affected communities to hold FMO 
accountable to its policies. (Non-­) judicial grievance, complaint and 
remedy mechanisms are able to test the robustness of the EPFIs’ commit-
ments and can, thus, help to close the gap between theory and practice.96 
Yet, with the exception of FMO, accountability and compliance mech­
anisms among the EPFIs are mostly lacking. What is urgently needed is 
a mechanism which allows affected stakeholders as the rights-­holders to 
file complaints of non-­compliance with EPFIs and the EPA. This is of 
particular importance for the most vulnerable and marginalized groups in 
society such as indigenous peoples.

5.1.5  Impact benefit agreements
In practice, mandatory and legally binding revenue-­sharing and Impact 
Benefit Agreements (IBA) between MNCs and indigenous peoples’ 
­negotiation committees are required. IBAs go beyond voluntary and 
informal negotiation protocols or memorandums of understanding. They 
record in a written form mitigation measures, financial compensation-­
schemes and benefit-­sharing. Typically they
include commitments and targets in the areas of employment, training, busi-
ness opportunities, revenue or equity sharing, and environmental protection; 
and they establish clear, formal channels for communication and dispute 
­resolution . . . Furthermore, some IBAs are re-­negotiated periodically through-
out the life of a [project], which forces companies to seek and keep community 
consent beyond the permitting stage.97
IBAs should also contain clearly defined community-­development plans, 
e.g., biodiversity action plans, schooling and healthcare programs, to name 
a few. Additionally, the setup of community liaison officers, grievance 
officers and resettlement-­negotiations committees should be compulsory 
for the EPFIs’ clients.
5.1.6  Positive leverage-­based responsibility
(EP)FIs are right at the center of the global political economy linking 
the ‘real economy’ with the finance sector. They equal economic pace-
makers or powerhouses which keep the economic in ‘blood’ circulation. 
Financial decision-­makers and project sponsors are thus among the most 
powerful players in the global political economy. By providing financial 
support to their clients (provision of corporate loans; managing, under-
writing and/or assisting with the issuance of shares and bonds; (EP)FIs 
as ­shareholders), (EP)FIs exert a substantial leverage over their business 
partners. This is particularly true prior to deal approval and over the life 
of the loan. Therefore, (EP)FIs are those institutions which (co-­) deter-
mine whether or not financial resources are used in an ethical and sustain-
able manner. They are key actors in the transition towards an ethical and 
‘green economy’. By voting with their money, they ideally help catalyze 
the transitional process towards economic, ecological and social sustain­
ability.98 Equator banks, in particular, have a strong leverage-­influence 
over their clients’ behavior: They not only decide which projects get

financed but also which ones do not. They also intensively collaborate 
with their clients over the life of the loan and (help) working out (and 
monitor) socio-­environmental impact assessment, management systems 
and action plans. Thus, EPFIs have the ability to influence and shape their 
client’s behavior on the ground.
The argument of this chapter to move towards a positive and leverage-­
based CSR-­concept requires EPFIs to exert sufficient leverage prior and 
after deal approval to promote good business practice (this of course 
demands a strong corporate will and a change in EPFI’s/clients’ cor-
porate culture as explained above). That is, the chapter asks for human 
rights advocacy and activism of EPFIs to protect and realize human 
rights,99 one that goes beyond the mere negative corporate duty to respect 
human rights (and which also goes beyond mere HRDD). To put it dif-
ferently, due to their political power and authority, EPFIs have direct 
and positive leverage-­based human rights duties to fulfill. They should 
use their powers for the common good. In particular, this requires (EP)
FIs to:
●
●
Avoid being (silently) complicit in human rights violations;
●
●
Speak out against ongoing, systematic and severe human rights 
violations;
●
●
Promote human rights-­compatible institutions in home and host 
countries; and
●
●
Influence institutional change inside the industry branch and in the 
countries of operation.
One way to exert leverage and influence over business partners in 
the supply-­ and value-­chain is via business contracts and/or (EP-­) cov-
enants: Through their contractual business relationships EPFIs can easily 
build human rights requirements such as HRDD, HRIA, HRAP and 
IBAs as well as project-­level grievance, complaint and remedy mech­
anisms into their supply-­ and value-­chain management.100 Another way 
is to develop and implement adequate and effective investment policies 
which are able to address the harmful business practices of their clients 
(including human rights monitoring and supply-­/value-­chain ­screening). 
Furthermore, EPFIs should make use of divestment strategies as a means 
of exerting pressure, that is, they should disengage and divest from

­companies which constantly violate international socio-­environmental 
and human rights standards. To avoid being complicit in human rights 
violations, (EP)FIs have the responsibility to terminate all direct and indi-
rect business relationships and ties to corporations which are notorious 
for their harmful and detrimental business practices. Instead, they should 
invest in and foster socio-­environmentally friendly and sustainable (‘fair 
trade’) industries.
MNCs and in particular EPFIs should take proactive (and preventative) 
measures to help protect and realize the (human) rights of affected com-
munities. One way to do this is via properly implemented value-­/supply-­
chain screening, effective stakeholder-­dialogue processes, and project-­level 
grievance and remedy mechanisms. Furthermore, EPFIs could also make 
use of their political power and authority and lobby for human rights and 
human ­rights-­compatible institutions: They could promote and lobby 
for higher industry and governmental standards (e.g., in the form of 
industry-­wide codes of conduct or (trans-­) national regulation), engage in 
public human rights discourses, put pressure on perpetrators and abusive 
and authoritarian governments, e.g., by making use of diplomatic chan-
nels and/or by threatening the host government to withdraw FDIs.101 
Moreover, they could collaborate with NGOs, CSOs as well as home and 
host countries. For example, they could assist legislatures, governments 
and jurisdictions in crafting and enforcing legislation and regulation in 
support of human rights.102 Last but not least, they could support the work 
of local human ­rights ­activist groups, NGOs and CSOs and/or collaborate 
with (supra-­) national organizations in developing and enforcing binding 
­socio-­environmental and human rights standards.
5.2  Meso-­level: Equator Principles Association
5.2.1  Human rights principle
So far, the EPs keep (mainly) quiet when it comes to HRDD, HRIA and 
HRAP. Thus, it seems necessary to add a separate human rights principle 
which is solely devoted to the protection and realization of human rights. 
This principle should lay down the business-­ethical foundations (and 
expectations) for all the other subsequent principles. To retain a maximum 
of ten principles, Principles 7 and 9 (independent review and monitor-
ing) as well as principles 9 and 10 (reporting) could be easily combined, 
thus, creating space for a separate principle solely devoted to human

rights issues. This principle should then precede all others and serve as an 
anchoring or guiding principle.103
5.2.2  Automatic sanctions
What is required is the establishment of an enforcement pyramid104 as a 
credible deterrent. This pyramid should start with less coercive means 
like persuasion (appeal to a client’s socio-­environmental responsibilities), 
warnings (highlighting potential consequences of continued EP-­violation) 
and setting deadlines for bringing projects back into compliance. Only 
when less coercive means fail, should more coercive tactics been employed. 
They include formal sanctions like penalties and fines. The final stage of 
such an enforcement pyramid should include the delisting and exclusion of 
non-­compliant EPFIs.105
5.2.3  Absolute performance standards
Only clear, verifiable metrics that are transparently and independently mon-
itored allow for assessing the socio-­environmental and human rights per-
formance of EPFIs and their clients. These performance s­tandards should 
be developed in close collaboration with the UN Special Representative on 
Business and Human Rights and transparently monitored by an independ-
ent EP-­ombudsperson associated with the EPA and/or the UN Human 
Rights Council.
5.2.4  Minimum entry requirements
As of September 2016, no minimum entry requirements exist which have 
to be met prior becoming an EPA-member. As a consequence, signator­
ies are attracted that are not truly committed to the EP-­spirit. In fact, 
several Equator banks display an opportunistic behavior for strategic 
reasons such as green-­washing and window-­dressing. They just mimic 
the behavior of good EPFIs; yet, they do not have the intention to 
actually implement their new commitments. Those free-­riders gain the 
benefits of enhanced reputation and reduced threat of government regula-
tions without bearing the implementation and compliance costs.106 Thus,

­free-­riding and ­opportunistic behavior leads to competitive disadvantages 
for EP-­signatories, since they have to bear compliance and implementation 
costs while non-­compliant corporations do not. Additionally, free-­riding 
negatively affects the collective by lowering the standards of the code 
and by decreasing the level of compliance. In the end, the EPs’ ‘brand 
value’ might diminish.107 Most importantly, project-­affected groups suffer 
from a lack of effectiveness and practical failure of the EPs (including 
serious human rights violations).The implementation of entry criteria 
for EP-­membership, together with the adoption of absolute performance 
standards, could help overcoming the problems of free-­riding (and adverse 
selection) and lack of effectiveness. Mandatory entry requirements prior to 
becoming a member should include HRDD, IBAs, FPIC, and grievance, 
complaint and remedy mechanisms.
5.2.5  Reform of the Equator Principles Association
The existing Equator Principles Association needs reform in several 
dimensions.
5.2.5.1  Enhanced funding and staffing
The currently available financial and personal resources are insufficient to 
guarantee proper assistance and advice with regards to EP-­implementation 
and to effectively monitor EP-­compliance (the annual membership fee is 
only GBP £3,575). Thus, higher dedicated resources and more professional 
staff are required; the lack of professional expertise and limited resources 
needs to be overcome.108
5.2.5.2  Establish an EP-­Forum and an EP-­Advisory Group
A structural reform of the EPA in the form of creating an EP-­Advisory 
Group with representatives from stakeholders, NGOs and CSOs as well 
as an EP-­Forum for engagement on finance industry sustainability issues 
seems promising.109 The inclusion of stakeholders, NGOs and CSOs 
in decision-­making processes of the EPA could help to raise the public 
accountability and democratic legitimacy of the EPA and the EPFIs. It 
could also help to overcome confidentiality issues and to raise the overall

transparency of this CSR-­initiative in the field of project finance. The feed-
backs which would be generated via the EP-­Forum and the EP-­Advisory 
Group would be of great help to overcome practical challenges (e.g., with 
regards to FPIC-­ and project-­level grievance-­mechanism implementation) 
and to further strengthen the EP-­framework.
5.2.5.3  Knowledge-­transfer and information-­sharing
The lack of inconsistent EP-­implementation could be overcome by facili-
tating knowledge-­transfer, information-­sharing and membership capacity-­
building, especially via the EPA. The EP-­homepage is the ideal place 
to provide EPFIs with case studies and training materials, ­guidelines 
and implementation tools and resources. Moreover, best-­practice 
workshops and regional conferences should be organized to help with 
EP-­implementation.110
5.3  Macro-­level: Regulatory Framework
5.3.1  Regulatory measures
Voluntary self-­regulation and multi-­stakeholder CSR-­initiatives have 
proved to be partially ineffective, pointing towards the limits of soft-­law 
regulation. That is why a steering mix consisting of hard and soft law as well 
as mandatory and voluntary standards is required. Thus, stronger govern-
ment oversight including (more) legally-­binding (human rights) regulation 
as well as an extension of national legislation (including extra-­territorial 
jurisdiction) to not only include criminal liability of corporations but also 
human rights liability is indispensable.111 Governmental regulation should 
also be accompanied by increasing shareholder pressure; that is, pressure 
from socially responsible investors (including divestment strategies from 
companies which violate socio-­environmental and human rights standards 
and shareholders filing lawsuits against senior management), and market-­
regulation pressure (e.g., denied market access by the SEC and exclusion 
of non-­compliant companies from sustainability indexes).

5.3.2  Third-­party beneficiary rights for project-­affected communities112
Third-­party beneficiary rights for affected communities can enhance exter-
nal accountability and liability. These rights would allow non-­signatories 
to a contract (affected communities) to enforce their human rights against 
the contracting parties (EPFIs and clients). A third-­party beneficiary 
status would provide for a right to a promised performance enforceable by 
a non-­signatory to a contract. This approach proposed by Marco113 would 
hold both EPFIs and their clients accountable for failing to adhere to the 
EPs. It thus contains a right to proper EP-­implementation. Borrowers and 
lenders as promisors owe duties of performance to affected communities 
as local stakeholders, that if breached are enforceable by the respective 
communities. EPFIs and clients which violate the EPs could be sued.114 
Affected communities would be able to assert their third-­party beneficiary 
rights through breach of contract actions in courts. The overall aim is to 
curb negative socio-­environmental and human rights impacts on local 
communities and to ensure that affected communities and especially  –
indigenous peoples maintain their livelihoods.115
6.  CONCLUDING REMARKS
The chapter has argued for a move towards positive impact-­ and leverage-­
based human rights responsibilities of MNCs in general and (EP)FIs in 
particular. While negative obligations impose passive duties to withdraw 
from certain actions ((corporate) responsibility to respect human rights), 
positive obligations usually denote active duties, that is, responsibili-
ties to take proactive measures towards the fulfillment of the according 
obligations (duties to protect and realize human rights). Positive leverage-­
based (corporate) responsibilities require actors with superior powers and 
capabilities – such as MNCs – to exert this leverage to influence business 
­partners (in the value-­ and supply-­chain) as well as other (non-­) state 
actors, e.g., with the aim to promote human rights-­compatible institutions 
in home and host countries.
The chapter has also argued for a move towards hardening the soft law

in the medium and long run. This indicates that soft law CSR-­initiatives 
should gradually transform into hard law to become (more) effective.116 
The proposed reform measures offered here are supposed to lead towards 
(more) mandatory and legally binding elements of the EPs which might 
help to fully exploit the potential of this transnational CSR-­initiative. 
The overall aim must be to go beyond Ruggie’s PRR-­framework and the 
UNGP (and its negative corporate duty to respect human rights) to also 
include positive and leverage-­based corporate responsibilities. It remains 
to be seen whether the EPFIs and the EPA will be successful in hardening 
the EP-­framework, e.g., by adopting some of the proposed reform meas-
ures, and whether they are willing and are able to align the EPs with the 
BHR-­perspective outlined in this chapter.

Supply chain management, theory and regulation6.  Group companies: supply chain 
management, theory and regulation
Jodie A. Kirshner
INTRODUCTION
In 1892, 13 years after Thomas Edison patented an electric light bulb, the 
Edison General Electric Company and its main competitor, Thomson–
Houston Electric Company, merged to create the General Electric 
Company.1 Today, General Electric (GE) ranks as one of the largest 
American multinational conglomerate companies. The company earns 
more than half of its revenues overseas, and, according to the UN 
Conference on Trade and Development World Investment Report, holds 
more than $500 billion in assets abroad.2 More than half of its workforce 
is located outside of the United States.3
This chapter will explore the reasons that companies such as GE seek 
to expand internationally, how companies do so and the ways in which 
discrete national legal systems strive to keep pace with the international 
expansions of the companies that they regulate. In summary, companies 
generally broaden their international reach either to realize economies 
of scale in production and distribution or to reduce transaction costs. 
Companies may also expand to access new markets or supplies or 
to eliminate competition. While some scholars have advanced theories 
related to companies’ gradual expansion, others have more recently 
documented factors that enable some companies to be ‘born global’ and 
enter ­multiple international markets at once. Limited liability has made 
expansion through separately incorporated subsidiaries attractive for 
companies, and many have developed into vast corporate groups with 
multiple layers of subsidiaries controlled by holding companies. Because 
the law ­traditionally has treated each unit of such a corporate group as an 
independent company, multinational companies have posed a challenge to 
regulate, and the companies have manipulated their structures to insulate

assets from tort victims and creditors. Consequently, some legal systems 
have embraced new approaches to the regulation of corporate groups, such 
as adapting the law in some areas to regard corporate groups as single, 
unified entities.
INCENTIVES FOR INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION
Companies generally seek to earn profits by selling outputs at a higher 
price than they pay for the inputs needed to produce the outputs.4 GE, for 
example, produces jet engines using the metals tin, tantalum and ­tungsten.5 
In simplified terms, the difference between the sale price of a jet engine and 
the cost of the metals and other inputs constitutes its profit. Expanding 
overseas can assist companies in obtaining inputs at a lower cost and in 
achieving greater sales volumes of outputs. Expanding overseas therefore 
can increase corporate profits.
Inputs
Companies potentially can find a range of inputs available abroad at a 
lower cost than domestically or that are not available domestically. The 
inputs could include: (1) physical resources, such as minerals, raw mater­
ials, agricultural products or financial capital; (2) labor or (3) specialized 
services, such as technological capabilities.6 GE, for example, uses rare 
earth metals from China to manufacture its wind turbines.7 Labor costs 
vary among countries, and GE has relocated production facilities to 
benefit from cheaper production costs. According to its former CEO, 
Jack Welch, ‘Ideally, you’d have every plant you own on a barge to move 
with currencies and changes in the economy.’8 GE recently established

an assembly plant in Nigeria, where it manufactures hospital equip-
ment and power plant turbines.9 It has also responded to falling labor 
costs in the United States by moving its production of refrigerators 
from Mexico to Kentucky.10 The company has further moved to exploit 
specialized services overseas by, for example, building a research centre 
in Bangalore, India, where more than a thousand engineers work to 
develop medical equipment, jet engines and appliances,11 as well as 
utilizing specialized underground mining ­technologies from Australia. 
In 2012, it acquired  the Australian mining equipment manufacturer 
Industrea.12
While companies potentially can acquire cheap foreign inputs from 
third parties, they also can integrate the production and ownership of 
foreign inputs into their own corporate structures. Integrating the supply 
of the foreign inputs into their structures provides companies with control 
over access to the inputs, which, in turn, may increase the reliability of 
the supply of the inputs.13 GE Aviation, for example, recently acquired 
its Italian parts supplier Avio, as well as two 3D printing companies. ‘We 
want more under our control’, the head of supply chain management for 
GE Aviation said.14 When companies require inputs from third-­party sup-
pliers, they risk shortfalls, losses of intellectual property and the unwill-
ingness of external suppliers to make company-­specific investments, 
leading to inefficiencies.15 For this reason, for example, the Canadian 
energy company Husky Energy has integrated ethanol production within 
its corporate structure.16 Husky energy has had to comply with legal 
requirements to blend ethanol into the gasoline it has produced. Rather 
than deal with independent ethanol producers and risk an inconsistent or

inappropriate supply of ethanol, it has produced its own ethanol to meet 
its needs.
Integrating the supply of inputs internally also potentially can reduce 
costs. Transaction costs fall when one part of a company can use the 
outputs of another part of the same company for its inputs.17 Transaction 
costs – the costs associated with carrying out transactions – arise both in 
preparation for and after a transaction takes place. By providing their own 
inputs, companies avoid searching for suppliers and negotiating and draft-
ing agreements with suppliers. The companies, furthermore, avoid having 
to incur monitoring and enforcement costs after transactions with sup-
pliers take place, in order to ensure that the suppliers honor the terms of 
their agreements. The US wine producer E & J Gallo Winery, for example, 
­manufactures the glass wine bottles in which it bottles its wine itself, 
because it would be more expensive for the company to buy glass wine 
bottles from third-­party suppliers.18
Supply chain integration, however, can also cause losses.19 Companies 
may have difficulty coordinating multiple tasks. Furthermore, the inputs 
that companies require may not achieve volumes sufficient to realise 
­economies of scale, and outside companies may be able to supply the 
inputs at lower prices. With sales within the company guaranteed, an 
absence of competition may result in inputs of lower quality.20
Outputs
Increased sales of outputs, which expansion into international markets 
potentially can facilitate, directly increase revenues and also potentially 
can enable companies to realize economies of scale, by making it possible 
for companies to spread their costs over a greater number of outputs. 
One study by the global management consulting firm Boston Consulting 
Group has indicated that doubling output can reduce production costs 
by as much as 30 per cent.21 Companies sell outputs in foreign markets by

offering products at a lower price than the same domestic products or by 
offering products unavailable in the domestic market. GE, for example, has 
developed a hand-­held electrocardiogram device for rural India, which it 
has sold for less than the cost of previously existing electrocardiogram 
devices in India.22 After import duties fell in 2008, sales of French wines in 
Hong Kong have increased dramatically.23
While companies can license third parties to sell their products abroad 
or partner with overseas distributors and retail outlets, often they can 
gain better control over the quality and timing of the distribution of 
their outputs by undertaking their own distribution. GE, for example, 
has sought to acquire the power and grid business of the French electric 
and rail company Alstom in order to improve its own access to European 
electric power markets.24 The Korean conglomerate Samsung maintains 
an in-­house logistics company, Samsung Logitech, which supports the 
export of Samsung products, and the Anglo–Dutch consumer products 
company Unilever employs several thousand Indian women to deliver 
soap in rural Indian villages that more traditional distribution methods 
cannot reach.25
In addition to increasing their production of existing products to sell 
in overseas markets, companies can expand overseas into new lines of 
business that also share fixed and overhead costs. The Brazilian mining 
company Vale, for example, originally mined only iron ore, but it has 
diversified into other metals by acquiring a Canadian nickel mining 
company, Canico Resources, and an Australian coal mining company, 
AMCI Holdings.26 Diversifying into related areas can enable companies 
to create synergies from shared resources and skills. Procter & Gamble 
produces disposable diapers as well as paper towels, and the two products 
share the expense of developing new technologies to reduce ­manufacturing

costs and also of procuring paper supplies.27 Some commentators have 
observed, however, that GE suffered from excessive diversification during 
the 1970s, which harmed the overall performance of the company.28 GE 
began as an electrical company, then expanded backward into electrical 
generation and backward again into the manufacture of machinery for 
producing electricity.29 The company also moved to produce products that 
use electricity, and then into financing purchases of those products.30
THEORIES OF EXPANSION
Originally, the ‘Product Life Cycle Theory’ conceived by Harvard econo-
mist Raymond Vernon in 1966 provided the prevailing theory of corporate 
expansion.31 Later, in 1975, Swedish business scholars sought to update 
and improve upon the ‘Product Life Cycle Theory’ with a new ‘Uppsala 
Internationalization Model’; however both the ‘Product Life Cycle Theory’ 
and the ‘Uppsala Internationalization Model’ attracted criticism for their 
failure to account for the existence of small companies that have operated 
internationally from their inception.32 More recently, the ‘Born Global 
Theory’ of corporate internationalization has gained ground by explaining 
their existence.33

Product Life Cycle Theory
According to Vernon’s Product Life Cycle Theory, companies start to 
operate in their home markets and only gradually enter foreign markets.34 
Internationalization thus follows the life cycle of the outputs of com­panies. 
Vernon identified three stages of corporate development: First, products 
are developed in high-­income countries, notably the United States, in order 
to satisfy the needs of local consumers. During the first stage, proximity 
to the domestic customer base outweighs the importance of finding cost 
savings through foreign production. Second, companies begin to produce 
the same products in other advanced economies to serve those local 
markets. During the second stage, companies strive to realize economies 
of scale by increasing their production of the products. Third, as produc-
tion processes become increasingly standardized, companies begin to open 
manufacturing facilities in less-­developed countries in order to save addi-
tional costs.35
Indeed, GE gained momentum in its international expansion only since 
1981, when Jack Welch became CEO.36 While GE had earlier launched 
foreign sales operations, Welch pioneered larger investments in developed 
economies. After Jeffrey Immelt replaced Welch as CEO in 2001, GE 
expanded its reach into farther-­flung international markets.37 Today, GE 
operates in roughly 100 countries.38
Nevertheless, as differences among countries have decreased and the 
international breadth of companies has increased, Vernon began to ques-
tion his own thesis.39 Companies have appeared, increasingly, to produce 
products in several markets at once. Among technology companies, for 
example, it has become increasingly rare to observe companies limiting 
their markets to their home countries.

Uppsala Internationalization Model
The Uppsala Internationalization Model, developed by Jan Johanson and 
Jan-­Erik Vahlne, therefore recast Vernon’s Product Life Cycle Theory as a 
process of adaptation to unfamiliar markets.40 According to the Uppsala 
Internationalization Model, while differences in language, culture and 
politics initially dissuade companies from expanding abroad, over time 
they gain experience in similar markets that enables them to begin to enter 
progressively dissimilar markets.41 Companies therefore begin to grow 
by entering only the markets that they perceive as least different from 
their domestic markets.42 As they begin to enter these additional markets, 
they gain experiential knowledge that they later can use to identify 
­opportunities in increasingly foreign markets.43 In line with this theory, 
GE has entered into markets such as Canada and Australia more quickly 
and easily than it has entered into China.44 ‘China is big, but it is hard,’ 
Immelt has said.45
More recent studies, however, have criticized the Uppsala International
ization Model as too simplistic and have noted the frequency with which 
companies have skipped over stages of the Model.46 Neither the Product 
Life Cycle Theory nor the Uppsala International Model has explained the 
phenomenon of very small internationalized companies. To remedy this 
situation, analysts at the global consulting firm McKinsey have developed 
a new Born Global Approach.47

Born Global Approach
The Born Global Approach has sought to account for the signifi-
cant number of companies that now operate internationally from their 
­inception, enter several new markets at once and source supplies and 
export finished products into foreign markets.48 According to the Born 
Global Approach, advances in manufacturing techniques, the liberaliza-
tion of trade, improvements in transportation and communications tech-
nologies, as well as increases in the international experience of company 
managers, have lately facilitated companies in internationalizing swiftly, 
rather than gradually.49 Even small companies now immediately can 
compete abroad by providing specialized products, leveraging production 
technologies that make small-­scale production more cost effective and 
using new communication technologies that make it easier for employees 
to coordinate their efforts across borders.50 The speed and adaptability of 
Born Global companies has allowed them to compete effectively against 
domestic companies to meet the needs of foreign customers.51
The computer peripherals company Logitech offers a representative 
example of a Born Global company.52 Two Italians and one Swiss national 
founded Logitech and immediately located its operations and research 
and development offices in both California and Switzerland, then quickly 
expanded production into Ireland and Taiwan.53 The Logitech mouse 
­captured 30 per cent of the global mouse market within eight years.54
Follow-­on studies confirmed and expanded on the Born Global 
Approach. The US business school professors Benjamin Oviatt and 
Patricia McDougall, for example, noted the increasing ability of entre-
preneurs with international relationships and experience to access foreign 
resources, including supplies, human capital and financing, to create or

transport new products for sale in foreign markets.55 Rather than grad­
ually evolving into multinational companies, the companies that Oviatt 
and McDougall identified adopted a multinational approach from their 
­inception. The Danish scholars Tage Koed Madsen and Per Servais 
explained the existence of these companies as the result of increasingly 
specialized markets, reduced barriers to global sourcing and the rapid 
internationalization of finance.56 Madsen and his Danish colleague Erik 
Rasmussen also identified as factors in rapid internationalization the 
shortening of product life cycles, the prevalence of high-­tech products that 
require sales in multiple markets to cover their research and development 
costs and increased globalization more generally.57
FORMS OF EXPANSION
Companies can enter into a range of different types of relationships with 
foreign third parties, or they can expand internationally on their own.58 
When companies expand internationally on their own, rather than by 
licensing or contracting with third parties, for example, they can choose 
to establish new branches or to incorporate standalone subsidiaries. 
Companies that establish foreign branch offices simply operate in the 
foreign countries: Branches do not constitute legal entities independent of 
their parent companies. Subsidiaries, by contrast, qualify as separate legal 
entities, distinct from the parent companies that own them, even though 
parent companies often own most of the shares in their subsidiaries.
The option to form subsidiaries arose relatively recently. Inter-­corporate 
stock ownership originally was outlawed in the United States and Europe, 
and only natural persons could own shares.59 In the US, the first holding

production.

company act, which allowed companies to buy and hold stock in other 
companies, was not adopted until 1888.60 New Jersey was the first state to 
amend its code and open the door to group companies.61 To stop the flight 
of companies to New Jersey from other US states, and the loss of their tax 
revenues that the moves represented, other states soon followed New Jersey 
and amended their law.62
Unlike in the United States, the law in the United Kingdom did not 
change at a specific moment in history to allow for corporate groups. 
Under English law, companies may reserve powers for themselves in their 
corporate documents that the corporate law does not otherwise grant 
to them. Companies seem to have begun to award themselves power to 
acquire and own shares in other companies, and group companies began 
to show up in English litigation at the turn of the 20th century. An offi-
cial review of the company law that took place during the 1920s included 
­discussions of concerns specific to corporate groups.63
The civil law systems also began to encourage group relationships 
among domestic companies. In Canada, Latin America, East Asia and 
much of Europe, many companies have adopted pyramid structures. In a 
pyramid structure, one company controls another company that in turn 
holds a controlling stake in a third company. The first company in this 
chain controls the last company at the end of the chain but does not 
directly own shares in it.64

Over time, inter-­corporate ownership has enabled companies to cluster 
into global networks of subsidiaries.65 Cross-­shareholding, in which one 
corporate entity gains control over another corporate entity within a cor-
porate group by owning its shares, along with inter-­enterprise contracts 
and linked directorships have become common.66 While international 
networks of corporate entities linked into groups have seemed to enable 
more efficient delivery of products, the law in many areas has continued to 
treat each unit of a corporate group as a separate company, even as many 
of the networks have operated in a coordinated way and pursued joint 
strategies.67
BENEFITS OF SUBSIDIARIZATION
Companies deliberately can form subsidiaries, or they can acquire exist-
ing subsidiaries and leave them in place. Variations in national laws create 
idiosyncratic reasons for companies to maintain group structures, and 
more general benefits of operating though group structures, rather than 
­branching, also exist. Limited liability, for example, underlies many factors 
that potentially motivate companies to choose to utilize subsidiaries, rather

than branches. Regulatory requirements and tax treatment also provide 
reasons for companies to operate through group structures.
National legal systems treat branches and subsidiaries differently, 
although the treatment varies among countries. In Spain, for example, a 
subsidiary must maintain a minimum capital, while a branch does not.68 In 
the UK, closing a subsidiary requires a formal procedure, which a branch 
does not have to undergo, but the branch must file detailed financial infor-
mation about its parent company with English regulators, unlike the sub-
sidiary.69 In Singapore, subsidiaries must have at least one local director.70
The legal systems of most countries bestow on companies a separate 
legal personality and the limited liability that derives from it. The sepa-
rate legal personality makes a company a discrete entity, distinct from 
the owners, managers, and employees that comprise the company.71 As a 
result of the separate legal personality, the company can own property, 
sign contracts, pay taxes and sue or be sued in its own name.72 It can also 
exist in perpetuity, even as the composition of its shareholders changes.73 
Shareholders buy shares in the distinct corporate entity.
The principle of limited liability has protected the amassed wealth of 
investors against the liabilities of the companies in which they invest. 
Specifically, limited liability holds that investors cannot be liable in 
amounts greater than they deliberately have placed at risk by investing in a 
company.74 Limited liability is intended to encourage economic investment. 
If potential investors had to risk their entire worth, they would, the law 
assumes, be less likely to provide the financing. Limiting liability, however, 
68  A Spanish subsidiary incorporated as an S.A., a limited liability company 
by shares, must have a minimum capital of €60,102, whereas a subsidiary incor-
porated as an S.L., a limited liability company by quota, must have a minimum 
capital of €3,006. A branch is not considered a separate company.

may shift losses onto other stakeholders by, for example, ­protecting assets 
from the claims of tort victims and creditors or from taxation.75
Limited liability has enabled the conduct of business through group 
structures to result in reduced risk and also has created the potential for 
conducting business to result in greater financial returns. Group struc-
tures made it possible for companies to diversify into different businesses, 
each operated by a separate unit of the group. The following paragraphs 
explain how limited liability has incentivized the use of group structures.
Limited liability has facilitated investment in several ways. First, com-
panies that incorporate part of their business as a separate subsidiary, and 
allow outside investors to acquire shares in the subsidiary, attract capital 
where it is needed without allowing outside ownership in other parts of 
the business.76 Outside share ownership generally carries voting rights 
and thus opens the door to the dilution of control over decision-making. 
Group structures, therefore, can also contribute to the entrenchment of the 
positions of existing management against potential threats from external 
shareholders.77 Second, companies can use separate subsidiaries to attract 
additional investment by moving specific assets into a subsidiary and 
using the assets to secure loans offered by new creditors.78 Third, where 
new subsidiaries engage in risky activities, limited liability encourages 
investment in other parts of the companies.79 Limited liability confines 
the high ­liability risk to the individual subsidiaries, leaving the assets of 
the rest of the companies isolated from the liability of the subsidiaries. The 
creation of separate companies for particular operations, each with their 
own capital, can also contribute to the avoidance of liabilities to external 
creditors.
The use of subsidiaries can also facilitate compliance with regula-
tory requirements. Domestic law may require business to be conducted 
through companies incorporated within the jurisdiction.80 Companies

also incorporate separate subsidiaries designed to comply with other local 
regulations, such as those related to employment law or license holding, 
while leaving the rest of their operations outside the purview of those 
regulations.81
Another key driver of group structures is their use as a tool for min­
imizing tax. Losses of one subsidiary can be offset against the income of 
another, and profits and losses may be pooled among members of cor-
porate groups.82 Differences among national tax policies therefore often 
motivate the distribution of assets and liabilities within corporate groups. 
Lower corporate tax rates or the beneficial tax treatment of specific activi-
ties makes it attractive for companies to establish subsidiaries in particular 
jurisdictions. Companies maximize their profits in jurisdictions with low 
levels of tax by passing assets and liabilities within the group. Complex 
structures, therefore, can also conceal the financial position of individual 
companies in corporate groups from their shareholders and creditors. GE, 
for example, is rumored to have earned $5.1 billion from its US operations 
in 2010, yet it paid no US corporate income tax.83 Canada unsuccessfully 
has challenged guarantee fees paid by General Electric Canada to the GE 
parent company in the United States for serving no purpose beyond tax 
evasion.84
NATURE OF CORPORATE GROUPS
Corporate group structures that result from subsidiarization range from 
simple to complex. Complex structures entail numerous subsidiaries, both 
operating and non-­operating, as well as sub-­subsidiaries and sub-­holding 
companies. Complex structures may also involve other types of entities, 
such as special purpose entities (SPEs) and joint ventures.
Corporate groups have generally conformed to a vertical hierarchy, but 
they may also grow horizontally. Vertical groups arise from succeeding layers 
of parent and controlled companies, which operate at different points in a

production or distribution process.85 Horizontal group companies arise from 
cross-­ownership among sibling companies that operate at the same level in 
different sectors.86 Keiretsu in Japan, for example, generally comprise a 
bank, a trading company and a diverse group of manufacturing firms linked 
through share ownership.87 Chaebol in Korea typically involve interlocking 
ownership of companies and centralized control by a single Korean family.88
Subsidiaries within group structures possess varying levels of financial 
and decision-­making autonomy. While some groups allow ­subsidiaries 
scope to set their own course, others centralize decision-­making.89 A 
holding company may allocate capital to subsidiaries, set their policies, 
select their leadership and engage in constant monitoring. In large groups, 
the holding company may take on the role of an internal capital market, 
facilitating loans within the group.90
In some countries, kinship ties have played a significant role in corporate 
groups. Family members in these countries sit on the boards of individual 
companies within the groups. Companies in emerging economies that have 
lacked liquid capital markets have depended instead on their founding 
families to reinvest their profits in the companies in order to expand.91 
Roughly 85 per cent of businesses with revenues of more than $1 billion 
in Southeast Asia, for example, are family run, and roughly 75 per cent of 
such businesses in Latin America are family-­run.92

Supply chain management, theory and regulation    ­185
The structure of many corporate groups illustrates the complexity of 
potential arrangements. A line-­by-­line list of the members of the corpo-
rate group of GE stretches to seven full pages.93 The US multinational 
banking and financial services company J.P. Morgan Chase and Co. com-
prises investment banking, asset management, private banking, private 
wealth management, treasury and securities services, credit card services, 
retail banking and commercial banking.94 The corporate members of 
the investment banking division alone account for 52,250 employees in 
60 countries.95
While formally separate legal entities comprise a group, groups may be 
managed and marketed otherwise. Rather than conforming to the legal divi-
sions, management can be arranged according to product lines, and product 
lines might cross over different subsidiaries.96 The group may use common 
advertising and maintain a public image of itself as one single entity.97
Additional entities, including SPEs and joint ventures, can also form 
part of a group. Companies use SPEs primarily to isolate financial risk or 
minimize tax.98 Companies generally create SPEs to accomplish short-­term 
goals, such as acquiring a stream of specific assets.99 Typically, the parent 
company owns the SPE wholly, but by separating the SPE into its own legal 
structure, the parent can guarantee that its own insolvency will not affect 
the obligations of the SPE.100 The assets or liabilities transferred to the 
SPE exist on its own balance sheet, and not the balance sheet of the parent 
company.101
While best known for their role in the securitization of loans, companies 
have other uses for SPEs that relate to business strategy.102 For example, a

company may protect its intellectual property by transferring ownership 
of new technology to an SPE.103 Ownership by the separate entity ensures 
that pre-­existing license agreements do not extend to the new technology. 
In 2002, for example, GE held around $55 billion of its $500 billion in 
assets in SPEs.104
Additionally, two or more parties that seek to pursue a joint business can 
enter a partnership in the form of a joint venture. The venture could relate 
only to a specific project, or it could extend to a continuing business rela-
tionship. The contract generally specifies how the venture is formed, for 
how long, what each party must contribute, and how revenues, expenses, 
and control will be apportioned.105 Joint ventures are common to cross-­
border situations because some countries condition entry by foreign com-
panies into their markets on the formation of joint ventures with domestic 
partners.106 More generally, however, the joint venture can be used to pre-­
empt competition from the venture partner or to create a stronger entity 
on the basis of the constituent partners, as well as to allow both partners 
to diversify.107 Costs and risks are spread between the two partners, and the 
venture may be more attractive to financial investors than the individual 
companies.108
Since early 2000, GE, for example, has increasingly utilized joint ventures 
in its international operations, likely because of the increasing expense of 
acquiring foreign businesses outright. Joint ventures have also made it pos-
sible for GE to enter foreign markets where it has not built up significant 
expertise, by leveraging the relationships of its local partners in exchange for 
relinquishing some power and control. GE Money, the retail-­lending arm 
investors, which it pays to the loan originator in exchange for the revenues. The 
SPE bears the exposure to the risk of non-­repayment of the loans, while the origi-
nator receives immediate liquidity.

REGULATION OF CORPORATE GROUPS
The corporate law systems governing the individual units of corporate 
groups originated prior to the proliferation of interconnected groups and 
continue to apply to them.110 The theory of limited liability developed to 
encourage individuals to invest, so that companies could pool capital and 
put it to efficient use.111 Limited liability, however, still protects corporate 
owners within group companies, without distinguishing their incentives 
from those of human investors.112 While the concept of a corporate group 
may elude formal definition, different approaches to the regulation of cor-
porate groups have arisen, in some cases to realign the reality of the form 
with the mode of regulation.
Under a traditional approach to corporate groups, often referred to 
as ‘the separate entity approach’, individual parts of a corporate group 
maintain their own rights and duties, regardless of their connections to

the other entities in the group.113 Each part of the group retains its own 
separate legal personality, and limited liability protects its shareholders. 
The assets of the group may not be pooled to cover the debts of another 
unit of the group.114
As corporate groups have becoming increasingly prevalent, the separate 
entity approach increasingly has not seemed to reflect the economic reality 
of modern business. While the doctrines of separate legal personality 
and limited liability have protected individual shareholders against losses 
that exceed their initial investments, thus encouraging them to invest, 
the doctrines have had different consequences when they have applied to 
companies.115 Multinationals, for example, have exploited the doctrines to 
shield their parent companies from liability for human rights abuses com-
mitted by their foreign subsidiaries.116 When companies strategically have 
insulated dangerous activities within separate subsidiaries,117 the corporate 
fiction has ensured that each one remained legally separate despite their 
economic interdependence, and limited liability has protected the parent 
companies against responsibility.118
In addition, as multinational corporate groups have conducted business 
on a global scale, not only corporate law has failed to keep pace, but juris-
dictional law often has too. A mismatch has seemed to develop between 
the typically territorial scope of jurisdiction and the global nature of

­commercial markets and corporate activities.119 The national legal system 
where harm has occurred often has been unable to exercise jurisdiction over 
the parent company of a subsidiary that has committed wrongdoing.120
In the English case Adams v. Cape Industries, for example, a British 
parent company used an Illinois-­based subsidiary to export asbestos from 
its mines in South Africa to US customers.121 Cape later divested itself of 
its shares in the subsidiary. US employees of the US customers became ill 
from asbestos exposure. When they filed suit in the United States against 
the English parent company, the parent company refused to participate in 
the US proceedings because it had no assets in the United States. The US 
plaintiffs won a default judgment; however, the English courts would not 
enforce the judgment within the United Kingdom, finding that the British 
parent company had no presence in the US even though it had the US 
subsidiary. The English courts declined to disregard the formal separa-
tion between the British parent company and its US subsidiary for the 
purposes of recognizing jurisdiction in the United States, and they rejected 
arguments by the US employees that the company had sold its shares in 
the subsidiary in order to avoid liability over the claims of the employees.
Following similar judicial holdings, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, for 
example, took steps to protect its US parent company from liability 
in case an accident at a Canadian nuclear plant caused damage in the 
United States. The company forbid its US-­based engineers from engag-
ing in any work related to Canadian reactors. It also banned equipment 
built or designed by the US parent from being integrated into Canadian 
reactors.122
As a consequence of decisions similar to Adams v. Cape Industries and 
actions similar to those of GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, in some legal areas 
and in some countries the single entity approach has given way to a ‘single 
enterprise approach’.123 In contrast to the single entity approach, the single 
enterprise approach treats corporate groups in a unified way, recognizing 
that they often operate to further group interests, may offset profits and

losses on a group basis, move assets around the group, and leave some 
subsidiaries undercapitalized.124
Australia, for example, overrides the single entity approach in particular 
instances. Australian law permits group companies to consolidate their 
accounts at the group level.125 The law also prohibits public companies 
from providing financial benefits to other entities in the same corpo-
rate group without shareholder approval.126 In addition, in cases where 
a parent company should have known that one of its subsidiaries had 
become ­insolvent, the parent company can become liable for debts that the 
­subsidiary incurred after it should have entered insolvency proceedings.127
Australian law, however, has appeared to confine group treatment of 
companies to these specific areas and has not permitted more broad 
imposition of group responsibility. The Australian case, James Hardie v. 
Hall, for example, concerned claims of asbestos-­related illness brought 
by employees of a New Zealand subsidiary of an Australian parent

single enterprises, but also only in specific instances. German law divides 
corporate groups into three categories, which the law treats in different 
ways. The first type of corporate group, the integrated group, results when 
shareholders vote to give a holding company unlimited power to direct 
its subsidiaries. In return, the law makes the holding company jointly and 
severally liable for the debts and obligations of the subsidiaries. The second 
type of corporate group, the contract group, results when two corporate 
entities contract to give one entity the right to direct the other. German 
law requires the control of one entity by the other to advance the interests 
of the parent company or the whole group of companies, and, in return, 
the law extends special protections to minority shareholders and cred­
itors with enhanced protection. The final type of corporate group, the de 
facto group, results when one corporate entity exercises direct or indirect 
influence over another, even if no formal arrangement between them 
exists. German law treats the de facto group as one entity for purposes of 
­governance and liability.131
New Zealand law also includes single enterprise principles. In New 
Zealand, directors of subsidiaries may act in the interests of their holding 
companies rather than in the interests of their subsidiaries.132 Courts 
have authority to order one unit of a group to contribute to the assets of 
another insolvent unit of the group.133 If an entire group collapses, courts 
also have authority to pool all of the assets and liabilities of the group.134
In the United States, courts increasingly have interpreted laws related to 
corporate groups in light of enterprise principles. US courts have construed 
legislation to reverse intra-­group transactions,135 support ­intra-­group

­guarantees136 and to consolidate corporate assets in bankruptcy.137 They 
have also altered the priority of claims in the bankruptcy of one unit of a 
corporate group by treating intra-­group loans as equity rather than debt 
or by subordinating intra-­group loans to the claims of external creditors.138
The US case Amoco Cadiz illustrates this approach.139 After an oil 
tanker caused an oil spill off the cost of France, French plaintiffs lodged 
negligence claims in the United States against several entities in the Amoco 
corporate group, including the corporate parent. The US court found 
subsidiaries and also the parent company liable for negligence because 
the corporate group was integrated, with the parent company exercising 
control over its subsidiaries. Decision-­making in the company had been 
centralized to a degree that the subsidiaries could not implement policies 
without the involvement of the parent company. The court attributed the 
oil spill to negligence in the design, maintenance and repair of the steering 
mechanism of the tanker, and to negligent training which had failed to 
prepare the crew to avoid the spill.
The ability of courts to apply the single enterprise approach in a clear 
and predictable way, however, depends upon a clear and predictable defi-
nition of a corporate group. Given the variations among groups, the law 
has struggled to define what constitutes a ‘corporate group’, and this has 
made the regulation of corporate groups difficult.140 While legislation on 
taxation, accounting, or mergers and acquisitions sometimes addresses 
groups,141 such legislation has rarely defined corporate groups in a con-
sistent way or regulated them directly.142 Most legislation and judicial 
decisions have found group relationships on the basis of ownership, 
control and influence.143 Some have required a specific threshold level

of shareholdings or voting power,144 while others have examined more 
closely the substance of the relationship between corporate entities and 
have explored, for example, the ability of the parent company to affect 
the ­composition of the board of directors of the subsidiary, or the ability 
of the parent company to affect the outcome of a vote of the board of 
­directors of the subsidiary.145
Nevertheless, most legal systems and judicial decision-­making does not 
accept the enterprise approach to corporate groups. As a result, multiple 
layers of limited liability continue to insulate the individual entities in a 
corporate group from debts and liabilities, leading some to argue that the 
result was ‘a consequence unforeseen when limited liability was adopted 
long before the emergence of corporate groups’.146
CONCLUSION
Companies frequently have benefited from expanding across borders by 
gaining access to cheaper supplies, realizing economies of scale and reduc-
ing their transaction costs. Increasingly, rather than entering into overseas 
markets gradually, born global companies have competed immediately 
in overseas markets. Because limited liability has afforded companies the 
ability to ring-­fence risk, save costs and attract investors, companies often 
have chosen to establish subsidiaries in order to expand. The resulting vast, 
transnational corporate groups have challenged traditional approaches to 
corporate law, jurisdiction and corporate regulation. While a few ­countries 
have amended their law in some areas to align it with the increased preva-
lence of corporate groups, many transnational groups have remained 
­insulated from liabilities to tort victims and creditors.

Global sourcing through foreign subsidiaries and suppliers7.  Global sourcing through foreign 
subsidiaries and suppliers: challenges for 
Corporate Social Responsibility
Andreas Rühmkorf
INTRODUCTION
Most transnational corporations increasingly rely on foreign subsidiar-
ies and suppliers for their production of goods.1 Companies have usually 
developed a sophisticated and complex global sourcing strategy in order to 
reduce costs.2 Following recurrent reports about human rights violations 
at supplier factories in the developing world, many companies pursue a 
sustainable supply chain management policy.3 They publicise informa-
tion about how they work towards improving working conditions in their 
corporate group and supply chain. This engagement is usually part of the 
companies’ Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) agenda.
However, from a legal perspective, the use of foreign subsidiaries and 
suppliers constitutes significant challenges for the promotion of CSR.4 
The territorial nature of law, the separate legal personality of companies 
and weak law-­enforcement mechanisms in the developing countries where 
the production takes place create loopholes which make it difficult to hold 
Western transnational corporations legally accountable for irresponsible 
corporate conduct within their global production network.5 This chapter 
will first look at the challenges for CSR posed by the use of foreign 
­subsidiaries and suppliers in their global sourcing. It will then critically

discuss to what extent the home state of transnational corporations could 
fill those gaps by legal regulation.6 To that end, the chapter will discuss tort 
law, criminal law and disclosure requirements. It will also critically review if 
the multi-­stakeholder Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh, 
created after the Rana Plaza building collapse, could be a model for the 
future promotion of CSR.7 The chapter will argue that it is time that the 
home states of transnational corporations accept their responsibility for 
regulating the socially responsible conduct of those companies. In terms of 
its jurisdictional scope, the chapter focuses on English law.
GLOBAL SOURCING STRATEGIES: THE USE OF 
FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND SUPPLIERS
The outsourcing of the production of goods is an important strategic tool 
of transnational corporations to remain competitive.8 This is particularly 
the case in cost-­driven industries such as the garment industry or in the 
production of electronic devices.9 Whilst in these instances companies 
try to reduce the cost of manual labour, other industries such as the con-
fectionery industry need the supply of raw materials from overseas, for 
example cocoa beans.10 The global sourcing strategy of many transnational 
corporations includes foreign subsidiaries and/or suppliers, often based in 
the developing world.
Whilst companies have always sourced raw materials from overseas, 
the strategic use of manual labour as a cost-­saving tool has particularly

­developed since the early 1990s.11 Transnational corporations employ dif-
ferent global sourcing strategies: They can use directly owned foreign sub-
sidiaries for production or local firms as contractual partners (suppliers).12 
Where trade takes place between transnational corporations and their sub-
sidiaries abroad, and between foreign subsidiaries in different ­countries, 
this is referred to as ‘intra-­firm sourcing’.13 Over the last decades, many 
transnational corporations have developed their global production mech­
anisms in a way that they increasingly use suppliers instead of wholly 
owned subsidiaries.14 Under this sourcing strategy, the production relies 
on independent foreign suppliers.15 These suppliers are linked to the trans­
national corporation through contracts and together they form a network 
of suppliers.16
The organisation of the supply chain, which commonly spans over dif-
ferent continents, is described as supply chain management.17 The supply 
chain can be developed in a way that the whole production process is 
outsourced and transnational corporations purely organise the produc-
tion process and retain the brand. A good example is Nike that has, for 
decades, designed and marketed shoes in the United States which are all 
produced in factories abroad where the production costs are lower.18 This 
strategic separation of the company’s headquarters in the global North 
and West and the factories in the developing world has now become a 
standard business strategy, particularly in cost-­driven industries such as 
textiles.
However, whilst there are clear economic benefits of creating a 
complex global supply chain, there are recurrent reports about human 
rights vio­lations such as the use of forced labour at foreign factories.

Global sourcing through foreign subsidiaries and suppliers    ­197
Such incidents have had a negative impact on the reputation of Western 
transnational corporations that source from suppliers in the developing 
world.19 As a consequence of increasing public and political pressure, 
many transnational corporations have developed sustainable supply 
chain management as a strategic instrument to demonstrate that they 
are socially responsible in their global sourcing process.20 Companies 
with a global supply chain now commonly have CSR policies in place 
that address issues such as the prohibition of forced labour. To that end, 
many Western transnational companies have developed their own CSR 
code of conduct or have signed an international CSR standard.21 The 
company’s own foreign ­subsidiaries often adopt the same or a similar 
code of conduct. As the suppliers are not owned by the transnational 
corporation, the Western companies, as the buyers in the supply chain, 
regularly use their bargaining power to incorporate their CSR code of 
conduct into their supply chain contracts.22
Whilst it is evident that transnational corporations have increasingly 
addressed CSR issues in their global supply chain, the effectiveness of 
these regimes is a different question. Despite at least two decades of CSR 
policies, the reports about CSR violations repeat themselves.23 The 2013 
Rana Plaza building collapse is a strong reminder of the fact that we are 
far off from having achieved responsible corporate conduct throughout 
global supply chains.24

LEGAL CHALLENGES FOR CSR THROUGH 
FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND SUPPLIERS
This situation raises the question of to what extent global sourcing 
through foreign subsidiaries and suppliers constitute legal challenges for 
the promotion of CSR.
No Binding International Law Framework
So far, the legal discussion about CSR and transnational corporations has 
been particularly prominent in the public international law literature.25 It 
is important to note that there is no binding international human rights 
framework for transnational corporations. International human rights ini-
tiatives for transnational corporations are primarily soft law. For example, 
the UN Global Compact, which is widely adopted by companies as part 
of their CSR agenda, was not intended to be a ‘regulatory instrument’.26 
The Global Compact contains ten principles on human rights, labour 
standards, environmental protection and fighting corruption, but it is not 
a code of conduct.27 Corporations which have subscribed to it are required 
to submit examples of how they have complied with the Principles on an 
annual basis.28 The only control mechanism of the UN Global Compact 
is that the Global Compact can exclude members who severely violate the 
principles.29
In recent years, the UN Guiding Principles of Businesses and Human 
Rights have been the focal point of discussions about the responsibili-
ties of transnational corporations for the working conditions at factor­
ies abroad that they source from.30 The Guiding Principles were the 
result of the ­six-­year mandate of Professor John Ruggie as UN Special

Representative for Business and Human Rights.31 They have been called 
‘a landmark in the CSR debate’.32 The normative contribution of the 
Guiding Principles lies not in the creation of new international law obli-
gations, but in elaborating the implications of existing standards and 
practices for states and businesses.33 The Guiding Principles distinguish 
between the duties of states and the responsibilities of companies in order 
to indicate that respecting rights is not an obligation that current interna-
tional human rights law generally imposes directly upon companies.34 The 
Guiding Principles are intended to be implemented by countries and by 
companies.35 This aspect is ­important, as it recognises that there is a role 
for the home state of ­transnational corporations to regulate transnational 
corporations.
The Limiting Effects of the Shareholder Value Theory for the Promotion of 
CSR
Transnational corporations in the United Kingdom or the United States 
operate within the shareholder value paradigm that is based on an 
agency model of the company.36 This theoretical framing of the corpo-
ration mandates that it is the primary task of the management to be 
­exclusively accountable to the shareholders and to maximize their profit.37 
Consequently, the shareholders must be prioritized in the decision-­making

process.38 In English law, this theoretical framing of the company is legally 
embedded in s172 (1) of the Companies Act (CA) 2006, i.e., the duty to 
promote the success of the company.39 Whilst this duty allow directors ‘to 
have regard to’ the interests of various stakeholders, including suppliers, 
it requires directors to ultimately prioritise the interests of shareholders.40
This purpose of the company directly influences the way company 
directors engage with CSR in their global supply chain, be it through its 
own foreign subsidiaries or a network of overseas suppliers. Under this 
model of the firm, companies will only promote CSR to the extent that 
it can be based on the business case in the interest of shareholders, i.e., 
that it promotes the reputation of the firm.41 The voluntary engagement of 
­transnational corporations with CSR in their global production is there-
fore limited. Rather, transnational corporations focus on the strategic use 
of foreign subsidiaries and suppliers as a cost-­saving instrument.42
Territorial Limits of the Law and the Legal Structure of Companies
The violation of CSR principles at factories run by either subsidiaries or 
suppliers of transnational corporations in the developing world pose a 
significant challenge due to the territorial nature of the law and the legal 
personality of companies.

Global sourcing through foreign subsidiaries and suppliers    ­201
First, the law that is primarily applicable to irresponsible corporate 
conduct at factories in the developing world, such as tort law or crimi-
nal law, is the law of those countries where the particular incidents have 
occurred.43 For example, the laws applicable to the Rana Plaza Building 
collapse are, first and foremost, the laws of Bangladesh. This situation can 
constitute a challenge where the substantive law of the country where the 
violation of CSR principles took place has, for example, lower standards in 
criminal law and tort law.44 More often, however, it is not so much the sub-
stantive law that is weak in those countries, but rather the law-­enforcement 
mechanisms.
Second, most transnational corporations do not own the factories that 
produce for them; rather, the production is done by either foreign sub-
sidiaries which are owned by the transnational corporations or by foreign 
suppliers. The difference between subsidiaries and suppliers is that subsidi-
aries are owned by the Western transnational company, whereas suppliers 
are usually completely independent from the transnational company, i.e., 
they are owned by other people who are not linked to the transnational 
corporation. The different ownership structures of the two forms – foreign 
subsidiaries and suppliers – also has consequences for the liability of the 
transnational corporation. Supplier companies are legally completely inde-
pendent companies from the transnational corporation as they are owned 
by different people. However, there is often a strong economic dependence 
of the suppliers on the transnational corporation as the buyer of their 
goods.45 Their conduct could reflect on the transnational corporation in 
terms of reputation, but not in terms of legal liability.
Foreign subsidiaries, on the other hand, are linked to the transnational 
corporation through ownership.46 The transnational corporation holds 
the majority of the shares of the subsidiary, often it is even the sole 
shareholder, making the other company its wholly owned subsidiary.47 
The transnational corporation, as the parent company, can decide, for

example, who the directors of the subsidiary are, and it benefits from its 
profits. However, in English law, even wholly owned subsidiaries are legal 
entities separate and independent from the parent company.48 This is a 
consequence of the Salomon v. Salomon principle which has established 
that companies have a separate legal personality from their shareholders.49 
This principle has been expanded to corporate groups with the effect that 
the parent companies are not vicariously liable for the conduct of their 
subsidiaries.50
CRITICAL REVIEW OF EXISTING ATTEMPTS TO 
REGULATE CSR IN GLOBAL SOURCING
In the absence of binding human rights obligations on transnational 
corporations in international law, other regulatory mechanisms for the 
promotion of CSR in the global production have been attempted. Most of 
these are private governance initiatives that are developed and governed in 
the private sphere between companies, sometimes involving third parties 
such as non-­governmental organisations.51 Other regulatory initiatives 
rely on the home state of transnational corporations such as the US Alien 
Tort Claims Act (ATCA). This section will critically review these measures 
in terms of their ability to promote the socially responsible conduct of 
­transnational companies.
CSR BASED ON PRIVATE GOVERNANCE SCHEMES
Many transnational corporations with well-­known brands are vulner-
able to reputational risks and have therefore voluntarily adopted codes 
of conduct that address the way they run their business.52 Such codes of

sourcing which they integrate into the supply chain relations with their suppliers, 
see L. Preuss, ‘Codes of conduct in organisational context: from cascade to lattice-­
work of codes’ (2010) 94 Journal of Business Ethics 471, 475. Preuss analysed the 
range of codes that constituent firms of the FTSE100 index use. His findings show 
that 77 companies used a general, company-­wide code of conduct which often also 
included stipulations for suppliers, 43 companies had adopted ethical sourcing

conduct usually establish principles of good business conduct that the 
company pledges to comply with.53 Transnational corporations increas-
ingly incorporate their code of conduct into their business relations with 
their suppliers, for example through their supply contracts.54 Depending on 
how the principles in the codes of conduct are phrased, they can become 
contractually enforceable clauses.55
At first sight, such private governance regimes appear to be a useful 
tool to achieve greater socially responsible conduct across the global 
supply chain of transnational corporations. Through codes of conduct, 
transnational companies can bind themselves to human rights obligations 
which are otherwise only contained in international soft-­law standards.56 
Moreover, by giving these principles contractual force within their sup-
plier contracts, the transnational companies are able to transcend the 
­territorial limits of law, and they can thus impose human rights standards 
on ­suppliers in the developing world.
However, despite their widespread use among most transnational corpo-
rations, private CSR governance regimes have not prevented the repeated 
violations of human rights at supplier factories in the developing world. 
Recent examples of irresponsible corporate conduct at supplier factories 
include the fire at the textile factory Tazreen Fashions in Bangladesh 
(November 2012), the widespread use of forced labour in the Thai fishing 
industry (June 2014), breaches of working time and safety equipment 
provision in the production of electronic devices in China (July 2014), 
and, most notably, the deadly Rana Plaza building collapse in Bangladesh 
(May 2013).57 All these violations of CSR principles occurred despite 
policies which specifically contain what companies expect from their suppliers in 
terms of CSR standards.

public awareness of human rights breaches in global sourcing and the CSR 
­policies of most transnational corporations.
Moreover, where the CSR principles have been violated within these 
private governance systems, the transnational corporations got away with 
impunity. There is no sanction system such as in state-­based regulation 
that applies in case the CSR principles are violated. Companies only 
have to face reputational concerns. Where the CSR codes of conduct 
are incorporated into the contracts between transnational corporations 
and their suppliers, the monitoring of compliance and the enforcement 
depends on the Western transnational company as the obligations fall on 
their suppliers.58 The workers of the suppliers as the intended beneficiar-
ies of the contractual CSR clauses do not gain any right of ­enforcement.59 
And while many transnational corporations have increased their efforts 
to monitor the compliance of their direct suppliers (also called first-­tier 
­suppliers), the majority of violations of CSR principles occur further 
down the supply chain through subcontracting.60 These factories are 
beyond the reach of the supply chain contracts between the transnational 
corporations and their direct suppliers which contain the CSR codes of 
conduct. The private-­governance-­based CSR compliance system there-
fore allows transnational companies to publicly portray themselves as 
responsible whereas, in reality, subcontracting means that these systems 
often fail to address those factories where the human rights violations 
occur.

it collapsed, but the audit did not include a structural survey.61 This situ-
ation illustrates the failure of the existing private governance system of 
CSR promotion, based on the ‘voluntary’ inclusion, monitoring and 
­enforcement of CSR by transnational corporations alone.
Due to their failure to prevent the Rana Plaza disaster, the transnational 
companies in the fashion industry which source ready-­made garments 
from Bangladesh were under significant public and political pressure.62 In 
response, the fashion industry came up with different initiatives aimed at 
improving the situation in Bangladesh. A particularly interesting approach 
in this context is the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh as 
a multi-­stakeholder initiative.63 Its structure and mode of operation will 
be critically assessed here in order to discuss whether or not it could be a 
model for future CSR mechanisms in global sourcing.
The Accord, established in May 2013, is intended to improve the 
safety of garment factories in Bangladesh. More than two years after its 
development, in June 2015, the agreement had been signed by over 200 
apparel brands, retailers and importers from over 20 countries, most of 
which are from Europe; two global trade unions (IndustriALL and UNI); 
and eight Bangladesh trade unions and four NGO witnesses such as the 
Clean Clothes Campaign.64 The International Labour Organisation (ILO) 
acts as the independent chair of the Accord. This initiative covers all sup-
pliers of the companies that have signed the Accord.65 It is a five-­year 
legally binding agreement. It stipulates that independent safety inspec-
tions must take place at the factories that the signatory companies source 
from in Bangladesh. The factories are divided into tier 1, tier 2 and tier 
3 factories, depending on their share of the signatory company’s annual 
­production in Bangladesh by volume.
Where flaws are identified, the signatory company that sources from this 
factory is under an obligation to require the supplier factory to implement 
the corrective actions that were identified by the inspectors.66 Additionally, 
in the event of safety flaws being identified, the signatory companies also

commit to ensuring that sufficient funds are available for the corrective 
actions and that those who work at the factories in question continue to be 
paid.67 The Accord also provides transparency by the regular publication 
of the list of all suppliers in Bangladesh used by the signatory companies, 
written inspection reports for all factories inspected under the Accord 
and quarterly aggregate reports that summarise both aggregate industry 
­compliance data.68
The work of the Accord is funded through an annual membership fee 
paid by the signatory companies which depend on their yearly volume of 
sourcing from Bangladesh.69 The signatory companies commit to maintain 
their sourcing relationships with Bangladesh. The Accord is governed by a 
Steering Committee which consists of equal representation chosen by the 
trade union members and company members of the agreement (maximum 
three seats each) and a representation from and chosen by the ILO as a 
neutral chair.70 Disputes are regulated in the way that, in the first instance, 
the Steering Committee decides by majority vote within a maximum of 
21 days of a petition being filed. By request of either party, the decision 
of the Steering Committee may be appealed to a final and binding arbitra-
tion process. The arbitration award is enforceable in a court of law of the 
­domicile of the signatory against whom enforcement is sought.71
Through the involvement of different stakeholder groups in its govern-
ance structure and through the provision of remedial action, the Accord 
goes beyond the previous attempts to promote CSR standards at fac-
tories in the developing world. The Accord is a clear improvement as it 
does not rely on the transnational corporations alone. It can therefore be 
argued that future credible approaches to better promoting CSR princi-
ples in global supply chains should build on these positive features of the 
Accord.
However, the Accord has several weaknesses. First, it does not have 
­universal reach among transnational companies in the textile indus-
try. Its signatory companies are primarily European textile companies,

whereas the majority of US-­American companies that source ready-­
made garment from Bangladesh did not agree to this initiative.72 Instead, 
they created the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety which relies on 
a voluntary, business-­driven structure.73 In effect, the Alliance, by and 
large, continues to operate in the same way that the companies addressed 
CSR prior to Rana Plaza. Second, the Accord is a five-­year plan with no 
clarity, yet what is going to happen after its expiry date? It is quite possible 
that the signatory companies involved might then declare that sufficient 
improvements have been made so that, in their view, the scheme would 
not need to be renewed. It is not sure how much interest the public will 
take in the issue in a few years’ time. Third, the Accord is only a single-­
issue initiative that is restricted to one country. It is a reaction to a much 
reported disaster as companies felt the pressure to publicly demonstrate 
commitment to engage with the cause of the factory collapse, i.e., the 
poor health and safety standards at factories in Bangladesh. It is impor-
tant to bear in mind that global supply chains with poor health and safety 
standards exist in many other countries of the developing world, too.74 
Moreover, the violations of CSR principles in the global supply chain are 
not restricted to health and safety breaches alone; there are many other 
pressing issues that urgently need to be addressed, too, such as the use of 
forced labour.75 Finally, first reports about the effectiveness of the Accord 
indicate that the initiative does not cover the large-­scale subcontracting 
that it still taking place in the industry.76 The inspections ‘fail to address 
the greatest risks of this system’ which occur further down the supply 
chain.77

208    Research handbook on transnational corporations
Two years after Rana Plaza and the development of the Accord, trans-
national corporations have still not worked together to create similar 
multi-­stakeholder initiatives for other CSR issues and other countries. 
This situation shows that though the Accord is an improvement of the 
pre-­Rana Plaza world, we are still far from witnessing a new era in the 
promotion of CSR.
TORT LAW: THE LIABILITY OF THE PARENT 
COMPANY
Due to the challenges that many tort victims of foreign subsidiaries and 
suppliers experience with access to justice in their home countries, there is 
an ongoing discussion about the tortious liabilities of transnational cor-
porations that source from factories where CSR principles are violated.78 
Companies are liable in tort through vicarious liability.79 This is not a tort 
in its own right, but a rule of responsibility which means that the company 
is liable for the actions of other people such as employees.80
The prospect of making claims against the transnational corporation at 
the head of the global supply chain is attractive for the promotion of CSR, 
as these companies usually have better financial means and are based in 
Western countries which often provide easier access to justice. Moreover, 
transnational corporations with well-­known brands are concerned about 
the reputational damage that results, for example, from losing a case 
linked to human rights violations. It is exactly for these reasons that trans­
national corporations are commonly strongly opposed to be subjected to 
claims by victims of torts committed at the factories of their subsidiaries 
and ­suppliers.81 However, the structure of global supply chains makes 
it difficult to hold transnational companies liable. Although companies 
can be sued for torts committed by other people, the challenge for legal

­liability for the relevant torts here is that they occur at factories operated 
by subsidiaries and suppliers abroad. In the case of suppliers, this situation 
means that the tort is committed by a company which is legally completely 
separate from the transnational corporation as there is no link between the 
two through ownership.
Even where the torts are committed by the foreign subsidiaries of 
transnational corporations, the tort victims do not have a cause of action 
against the transnational corporation in English law either.82 All com-
panies in a group of companies are separate legal entities, even in cases 
of wholly owned subsidiaries with only little paid-­up share capital and 
a board of directors which predominately or solely consists of directors 
who are also directors of the parent company.83 Corporate group struc-
tures enable parent companies to reduce their liability risk in tort.84 The 
consequence of this approach is that tort victims of a subsidiary company 
might not be able to recover their loss, if the subsidiary is undercapital-
ised.85 In Adams v. Cape Industries plc, the Court of Appeal applied a 
strict approach to the question of piercing the corporate veil in corporate 
groups and dismissed the idea of a single economic unit between the 
parent company and its subsidiaries.86 The court held that the corporate 
veil could in only be pierced where special circumstances exist which indi-
cate that the corporate veil is a mere façade concealing the true facts, i.e., 
where the corporate structure is used to evade rights of relief that third 
parties may in the future acquire.
Slade LJ noted:
There is no general principle that all companies in a group of companies are 
to be regarded as one. On the contrary, the fundamental principle is that “each 
company in a group of companies (a relatively modern concept) is a separate 
legal entity possessed of separate legal rights and liabilities: see The Albazero 
[1975] 3 All ER 21, 28.”87
Slade LJ also stated that the use of the corporate group by a parent 
company as a means to ensure that legal liability in respect of future 
­activities of the group will fall on another member of that group was 
‘inherent in our corporate law’. The consequence is that the risk is allo-

cated to the poorer risk taker, the tort victim.88 This approach does not 
only ­disregard the fact that it puts tort victims as involuntary credit­
ors at a severe disadvantage; it also overlooks that limited liability was 
developed in the 19th century to promote business activities by invest­
ors, whereas ­nowadays parent companies strategically use corporate 
group structures with a range of (foreign) subsidiaries as an instrument 
to reduce their liability risks.89 Moreover, the rejection of the idea 
of group liability ignores the economic realities of corporate groups. 
Parent companies usually maintain close ties with their subsidiaries 
and they effectively control the running of these companies. The parent 
companies therefore benefit from the gains made by the subsidiaries 
whilst they avoid liability for their obligations. English law is also not 
coherent in its strict application of the Salomon v. Salomon principle as 
parent ­companies must prepare group accounts pursuant to s399 (2) CA 
2006.90
This approach of English courts to group liability constitutes a sig-
nificant challenge for the promotion of CSR, as tort victims are unable to 
make a claim against the transnational corporation as the parent company 
for the torts committed by its foreign subsidiaries. This approach needs 
to be changed in order to promote greater social responsibility of trans­
national corporations. The strategic use of subsidiaries to limit their liabil-
ity risks contributes to the irresponsible conduct that continues to occur at 
factories in the developing world.
A potentially different avenue to address the same issue is to hold trans-
national corporations primarily liable in tort for the working conditions 
at the factories of their subsidiaries. In the case Chandler v. Cape plc, it 
was held that a parent company can owe a primary duty of care in neg-
ligence to the employees of its subsidiary.91 In this case, the defendant 
Cape plc, as the parent company, was directly and jointly liable with its 
subsidiary (which had been dissolved in the meantime) in negligence for 
asbestos-­related injuries inflicted on the subsidiary’s previous employee 
(the ­claimant). Prior to this decision, there had been a longstanding 
debate about the question of whether or not such a primary duty exists 
in English law, but this issue was never formally decided by a court as the

cases were either settled or struck out for other reasons.92 The difference 
between this case and the previous discussion about group liability is that, 
in Chandler v. Cape plc, the parent company was held to have breached 
a duty of care which it directly owed to the employees of its subsidiary 
company. This duty of care was imposed on the parent company on the 
basis of an assumption of responsibility as the parent company had supe-
rior knowledge of the asbestos-­related risks that the employees of its sub-
sidiary were exposed to. Moreover, it dictated the overall health and safety 
policy of its subsidiaries and it also exercised control over their business 
behaviour to an extent that it had the ability to intervene.
The imposition of a direct duty of care on the parent company is dis-
tinct from any question of piercing the corporate veil as this approach 
respects the separate legal personality of the two companies. Rather, 
parent companies are liable for their own failure to protect the employ-
ees of its subsidiaries which resulted in their harm. Chandler v. Cape 
plc sets an important precedent for the legal responsibility of parent 
companies as it restricts the ability of parent companies to completely 
outsource their liability where they clearly have superior knowledge 
and are the dominant force within the group. However, it is unclear to 
what extent this precedent, which concerned a particularly dangerous 
­industry related to asbestos, might be applied to other business areas 
and  to cases between UK-­based transnational corporations and their 
foreign subsidiaries as the facts underlying this decision occurred in the 
UK.
TORT LAW: THE US ALIEN TORT CLAIMS ACT
Whilst this chapter focuses on English law in its jurisdictional scope, it is 
important to briefly consider the US Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) in 
this context as this statute has, for some time now, captured the interest 
of those interested in the home state liability of transnational corpora-
tions for torts committed abroad.93 This Act is, so far, the most successful 
92  However, it was already argued in the academic literature that a parent 
company could owe a primary duty of care to tort victims of its affiliates. See, for 
example: Zerk (n 25) 216.
93  See, for example, D. McBarnet and P. Schmidt, ‘Corporate account-
ability through creative enforcement: human rights, the Alien Torts Claims 
Act and  the  limits of legal impunity’ in McBarnet, Voiculescu and Campbell

example of holding parent companies liable in tort law.94 The ATCA was 
enacted in 1789, but only rediscovered and creatively used by NGOs during 
the late 20th century. The ATCA confers jurisdiction on the US District 
Court in respect of ‘any civil action by an alien for a tort only, committed 
in ­violation of the law of nations or a treaty of the United States’. Parent 
companies based in the United States can be held accountable for human 
rights violations by their subsidiaries abroad under the ATCA.
In Filartiga v. Pena-­Irala the court decided that non-­American citizens 
could be punished for tortious acts committed outside the United States 
which were in violation of public international law or any treaties to which 
the United States is a party.95 This decision is important as it extends the 
jurisdiction of US courts to tortious acts committed around the world. A 
further significant step for the use of the ATCA was the decision in Sosa 
v. Alvarez.96 Here, the US Supreme Court allowed courts to hear claims by 
private individuals for breaches of international law committed in other 
countries. These decisions were followed by a significant increase of claims 
against US parent companies. However, the courts have been reluctant to 
assume jurisdiction in cases where the claimants were not resident in the 
United States.
At present, the future use of the ATCA for tort liabilities of parent 
­companies for tortious acts committed outside the United States is 
uncertain. In Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. the Supreme Court 
decided in April 2013 that the Act would only apply to conduct within 
the United States or on the high seas.97 It would not create jurisdiction 
for a claim regarding conduct that occurred in the territory of a foreign 
sovereign. This decision effectively means that a presumption against 
extraterritoriality applies to claims under the Act. After this decision it 
is unclear if the ATCA will play a significant role for liability related to 
torts committed at factories of foreign subsidiaries of US transnational 
corporations. This development is unfortunate as the Act was able to fill 
an accountability vacuum.
Notwithstanding the decision in Kiobel, there is, at the time of writing, 
ongoing litigation under the ATCA concerning the use of forced labour at 
cocoa firms which supply the confectionery industry. In September 2014, 
a US appeal court held in Doe v. Nestlé USA Inc. et al. that the claimants

were allowed to amend their claim against Nestlé, ADM and Cargill so 
that the defendant companies could be held to account for aiding and 
­abetting child slavery in Ivory Coast.98 The court reinstated a lawsuit filed 
by three citizens of Mali in 2005 who claim that they were forced to work 
as child slaves on cocoa plantations in the Ivory Coast. This judgment 
overrules a previous decision by a district court which had dismissed the 
case on grounds that US courts had no jurisdiction for abuses committed 
by companies outside the territory of the United States. The court held 
in this case that at least parts of the act occurred in the United States. It 
remains to be seen, however, how the case is finally decided in light of 
Kiobel.
In summary, tort law is, at least in theory, an attractive avenue for the 
promotion of greater social responsibilities of transnational corporations 
as it provides remedies for tort victims. However, changes are necessary for 
English tort law to better promote CSR in global sourcing, for example 
group liability would be a strong incentive for transnational companies to 
use their power to improve working conditions at their foreign subsidiaries.
EXTRATERRITORIAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY: THE 
BRIBERY ACT
Criminal law is another area of the law that has much potential to improve 
the working conditions in the global production chain of transnational 
companies. English law applies criminal law to corporations.99 Where 
corporations are criminally liable, the requirements of the criminal act 
(actus reus) and the criminal mind (mens rea) are found in a person acting 
on behalf of the corporation such as the relevant officer.100 As companies 
cannot be imprisoned, they are, if convicted, sanctioned with a ­monetary 
fine. Like tort law, criminal law is, first and foremost, bound to the 
­territory of the jurisdiction where the crime occurs.101 Generally speak-
ing, where crimes are committed at factories in the developing world, the 
crime is prosecuted under the laws of that jurisdiction. The advantage 
of ­criminal law vis-­à-­vis tort law is that the prosecution is initiated by 
the state. It does not depend on the action being brought by a private 
individual and ­therefore, by definition, has a broader reach than tort law.

Moreover, the threat of criminal conviction acts as a strong deterrence, not 
just because of the financial consequences of convictions, but also because 
of the ­reputational concerns.
Extraterritorial criminal liability of transnational corporations in their 
home state is therefore an attractive idea to better promote CSR in global 
sourcing. In English law, this approach has been introduced in the UK 
Bribery Act 2010. Common to all cases of bribery in the Bribery Act is 
the offer or taking of a ‘financial or other advantage’.102 The Act has a 
near-­universal jurisdiction. This approach makes it possible to prosecute 
an individual or a company with links to the United Kingdom, regardless 
of where the crime occurred. In particular, the Act makes it an offence 
for commercial organisations which have business in the UK to fail to 
prevent bribery by a person associated with it.103 The associated person 
can be an employee, agent, subsidiary or supplier.104 However, the Act also 
provides a defence for a commercial organisation if it can prove that it 
had adequate procedures in place designed to prevent persons associated 
with it from undertaking such conduct.105 The government has published 
guidance about what ‘adequate procedures’ could be.106 The guidance, 
inter alia, ­recommend companies to use due diligence mechanisms such as 
­anti-­bribery terms and conditions in their supply contracts.107
The interesting feature of this approach in terms of promoting CSR 
is that companies can protect themselves against liability through taking 
active steps to prevent bribery in their supply chain. The risk of liability 
combined with the defence of ‘appropriate procedures’ effectively forces 
companies to take measures aimed at preventing bribery in their supply 
chain. As the Bribery Act directly addresses the transnational corpora-
tions, it overcomes the limits caused by the territoriality principle and the

separate legal personality. Transnational corporations cannot outsource 
their legal responsibility for bribery in their supply chain.
However, as this liability only concerns bribery, it will not force 
­companies to address other CSR issues in their supply chain with the same 
caution. The range of CSR violations in their supply chain goes beyond 
the committing of bribery. It is a missed opportunity that the legislator 
did not follow the model of the Bribery Act for the UK Modern Slavery 
Act 2015. There was a discussion about how forced labour in the supply 
chain of UK-­based transnational corporations should be addressed in 
the Act.108 One of the options discussed was to create criminal liability 
­modelled on the Bribery Act. However, this idea was eventually rejected 
and, instead, a supply chain transparency clause was included in the Act.109
DISCLOSURE: CSR REGULATION THROUGH 
TRANSPARENCY
Corporate reporting on CSR, both mandatory and voluntary, has grown 
exponentially over the last years. Based on public pressure and reputa-
tional concerns, companies increasingly voluntarily report their engage-
ment with CSR, including their global supply chains. However, NGOs 
often criticise these voluntary reports for being public relations instru-
ments that are written in rather vague language and that are not verified. 
At the same time, mandatory reporting requirements have been an increas-
ingly popular instrument for governments to require companies to report 
on their engagement with their social responsibilities.
In English law, the strategic report,110 which was previously the business 
review,111 has the purpose of informing members of the company how the 
directors have performed their duty under section 172 CA (duty to promote 
the success of the company). As this duty refers to a range of stakehold-
ers, the strategic report could be an instrument to better promote CSR. In 
case of a quoted company, the strategic report must, to the extent neces-
sary for an understanding of the development, performance or position 
of the company’s business (a) include the main trends and factors likely to 
affect the future development, performance and position of the company’s

business and (b) (i) include information about environmental matters 
(including the impact of the company’s business on the ­environment), 
(ii) the company’s employees and (iii) social, community and human rights 
issues, including information about any policies of the company in relation 
to those matters and the effectiveness of those policies.112 However, if the 
review does not contain information regarding these issues, it must only 
state which of these categories it does not contain.
This last sentence of the section shows that quoted companies do not 
have to report on the range of CSR issues such as human rights in the stra-
tegic report as long as they declare that their report does not contain this 
information. This is a severe limitation for the promotion of CSR. In effect, 
the reporting about CSR is degraded to a voluntary exercise for directors. 
Moreover, the law remains very vague about what needs to be included in 
it. The danger is that directors can comply with their reporting duty even 
if they make rather neutral statements.113 Research about the predecessor 
of the strategic report, the business review, confirms this sceptical view. A 
study by Villiers and Aiyegbayo, based on semi-­structured interviews with 
key corporate governance actors such as investor relations managers and 
corporate governance directors from institutional investment firms, showed 
that the business review made little difference to the quality of reports.114 
The authors of this study conclude that companies are struggling to report 
effectively about their non-­financial key performance indicators.115
The continuing debate about the need to require transnational com-
panies by law to be more socially responsible has been taken up by the 
European Union. A new Directive on non-­financial information disclo-
sure, adopted in 2014, requires public-­interest companies with more than 
500 employees to disclose relevant and material environmental and social 
information in their annual reports from 2017 onwards.116 The Directive 
stipulates that the annual report of these companies must include a non-­
financial ­statement containing information relating to at least environmen-
tal, social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-­corruption 
and bribery matters.117 This statement must include a description of the

policy pursued by the company in relation to these matters, the results of 
these policies and the risks related to these matters and how the company 
manages those risks. Companies that do not pursue policies in relation to 
one or more of these matters shall provide an explanation for not doing 
so.118
The Directive goes beyond the strategic report as it is more prescrip-
tive and as it applies the ‘comply or explain’ approach to CSR reporting 
which means that companies have to give an explanation in case they do 
not pursue policies. Although the Directive fails to require external veri-
fication of the company’s CSR reporting, it will expand the quantity of 
disclosure on those issues by transnational corporations. The Directive can 
create a level playing field among companies across the European Union 
as it expects companies to have a policy on CSR issues. Still, it remains to 
be seen to what extent companies are going to use this reporting duty as a 
genuine opportunity to openly and critically reflect on their CSR policies.
The increasing focus on global supply chains has led to the inclusion of 
a transparency-­in-­supply-­chains clause in the Modern Slavery Act 2015.119 
This clause requires companies of a size that, at the time of writing, is yet 
to be determined to prepare a slavery and human trafficking statement 
for each financial year of the organisation.120 In order to comply with this 
reporting duty, companies must either describe the steps that they have 
taken during the financial year to ensure that slavery and human traffick-
ing is not taking place in any of their supply chains, and in any part of its 
own business, or make a statement that they have taken no such steps.
The strength of the transparency in supply chains clause is that it recog-
nises the important role of transnational corporations for the eradication 
of forced labour in global supply chains. However, the clause is rather 
vague and leaves much discretion to the companies. It fails to establish a 
requirement that companies must have external third-­party verification of 
their forced labour statement. It is likely that, in most cases, companies 
will be able to continue to report in the same way about how they combat 
forced labour in their supply chain as they already do in their voluntary 
CSR report. In actual fact, the transparency in supply chains clause 
resembles many features of the California Transparency in Supply Chains 
Act 2010 which, too, requires disclosure on the efforts of a company on 
combatting forced labour in its supply chain. However, it is also rather

soft, with no enforcement power and no requirement to have the report 
externally verified.121
The various reporting requirements pertaining to CSR issues that 
have been introduced in the past years demonstrate that, at the moment, 
the legal regulation of CSR in global sourcing is primarily transparency 
laws. Whilst these initiatives are positive steps towards recognising that 
­transnational corporations have social responsibilities for the working 
conditions at the factories of their foreign subsidiaries and suppliers, they 
all lack stringency.
CONCLUSION
Recurrent reports about irresponsible corporate conduct by foreign 
­subsidiaries and suppliers of Western transnational corporations 
­demonstrate that the mainly voluntary, business-­driven, private govern-
ance regime of CSR in global production chains has failed. Transnational 
corporations are able to hide behind their foreign subsidiaries and sup-
pliers. The division between the corporate headquarters in the global 
North and West and the production in the developing world presents 
challenges for the law to adequately address violations of CSR principles. 
Transnational corporations outsource both the production and the legal 
responsibility. Whilst foreign subsidiaries already pose a significant chal-
lenge for holding transnational corporations as the parent companies 
legally accountable, this situation is even more difficult in case of suppliers 
which are owned by third parties.
Despite its weaknesses, the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in 
Bangladesh as multi-­stakeholder initiative displays some features that 
future CSR regimes should build on such as its inclusion of different 
stakeholder groups and its access to remedies. However, two years since its 
development, no similar scheme for other countries and other CSR issues 
has been developed. The danger is that the Accord remains a single-­issue 
initiative that resulted from significant public and political pressure in the 
wake of the Rana Plaza disaster.
In the absence of a binding international human rights framework for 
transnational corporations, there is a growing consensus that the home 
state of transnational corporations has got a more important role to play 
in the promotion of CSR. The home state could fill some of the legal

­loopholes of global sourcing. However, at present, the regulation of CSR 
issues is focused on disclosure laws which are not stringent enough to 
ensure that transnational corporations go beyond their present efforts. The 
chapter has shown that tort law and corporate criminal law could be an 
important part of the legal promotion of CSR, as they have the potential 
to hold transnational corporations legally accountable for irresponsible 
conduct at factories run by subsidiaries and/or suppliers. However, in 
order to use their full potential, both areas need amendments in English 
law.

Transnational pharmaceutical industry; the Trans Pacific Partnership8.  How the transnational pharmaceutical 
industry pursues its interests through 
international trade and investment 
agreements: a case study of the Trans 
Pacific Partnership
Deborah Gleeson, Pat Neuwelt,
Erik Monasterio and Ruth Lopert
INTRODUCTION
This chapter explores the strategies used by transnational pharmaceuti-
cal companies and their industry associations to advance their economic 
interests through international trade and investment agreements. We 
begin by characterizing the research-­based pharmaceutical industry as 
a transnational industry with a concerted global agenda to expand and 
extend monopolies over its products, thereby increasing returns for its 
shareholders. We describe the broad set of strategies employed to meet 
these ­objectives. We then give an historical overview of attempts by the 
industry to use international trade agreements to expand intellectual 
property rights and constrain the operation of pharmaceutical cover-
age programs. Focusing specifically on the Trans Pacific Partnership 
Agreement (TPP), we explore the ways in which pharmaceutical industry 
bodies in the United States and other TPP countries have sought to influ-
ence the negotiations to further their agenda and protect and promote the 
industry’s interests.
THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AS A 
TRANSNATIONAL INDUSTRY
In this part of the chapter, we describe the large and growing market for 
medicines, and the nature and global distribution of the highly profitable 
industry engaged in research and development, manufacturing, sales and 
distribution of patented medicines. We focus particularly on the research-­
based pharmaceutical industry (hereafter, ‘the pharmaceutical industry’ or

‘the industry’) rather than generic medicines manufacturers.1 The two parts 
of the industry have different objectives in relation to international trade 
agreements, and our purpose in this chapter is to explore the ­influence 
of intellectual property owners in the context of trade ­negotiations – 
in ­particular, the Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement.
The Global Pharmaceutical Market
The global pharmaceutical market is large and reported to be expanding 
rapidly, with spending on pharmaceuticals estimated at US$965 billion 
in 2012 and likely to reach almost $1.2 trillion by 2017, according to 
projections by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics.2 While high-­
income countries account for most of the current spending on pharma-
ceuticals, expenditure growth in these countries has slowed in recent years 
due to a combination of factors including patent expiries, increasing use 
of generics, cost containment measures and the long term impact of the 
global economic crisis. Global pharmaceutical expenditure is expected 
to begin increasing after 2014, primarily due to fewer patent expiries.3 
It is expected to grow most rapidly in middle-­income ­countries, particu-
larly China, Brazil, Russia and India, as their ­economies and healthcare 
systems develop.4 In 2012, originator products made up almost two-­thirds 
of global spending on pharmaceuticals; however, future increased spend-
ing on generic medicines in emerging economies is expected to lead to 
generics making up a growing share of the market.5
Health expenditure generally accounts for a large proportion of each 
country’s spending, and pharmaceutical expenditure in turn accounts for 
a large proportion of health spending. In 2012, the average expenditure

part of the pharmaceutical industry which is engaged in research, manufactur-
ing, promotion and sale of patented medicines. In many cases there is an overlap 
between the two parts of the industry, particularly given the increasing ten-
dency towards mergers and acquisitions. Some generic manufacturers also hold 
­secondary patents.

having the highest health expenditure at 16.9 per cent.6 In the same year, 
OECD countries spent on average 15.9 per cent of their health expenditure 
(or $498 PPP per capita) on pharmaceuticals.7
Nature and Global Distribution of the Pharmaceutical Industry
While the pharmaceutical industry is transnational in nature, manu-
facturing and research and development (R&D) activity is con-
centrated in certain countries, notably the United States, Japan and 
France.8 According  to  the International Federation of Pharmaceutical 
Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), Europe is the biggest exporter 
of pharmaceuticals.9
Publicly available statistics describing the state of the global research-­
based pharmaceutical industry are difficult to obtain – particularly 
­aggregate data estimating profits and spending on marketing and 
­promotion. To understand the shape and structure of transnational 
­pharmaceutical companies, we must examine the configuration and 
­activities of particular companies.
In stark contrast to the difficulty of obtaining data on sales, revenue and 
profits, figures for R&D spending abound. Industry reports suggest that 
almost $137 billion was invested in R&D by the ‘research-­based pharma-
ceutical industry’ in 2012.10 According to the IFPMA, R&D spending in

development. The few published estimates are highly contested. The most 
recent figure of $2.6 billion (representing an increase of 145 per cent over 
a decade) as the cost of bringing a new drug to market was estimated by 
the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development in November 2014.12 
This figure included around $1.4 billion in direct drug development costs 
and $1.2 billion in ‘time costs’ (i.e. the opportunity costs associated with 
foregone returns to investors during the development process).13 The Tufts 
Center estimate has been heavily criticized, as the industry data on which it 
is based (provided by ten pharmaceutical companies) have not been made 
publicly available.14, 15 In fact, the report itself has not yet been released; 
to date only a press release, slide show and background paper about the 
study’s methodology have been made available.16
Company Structures and Relationships
As shown in the Pfizer example in Box 8.1, large transnational pharma-
ceutical companies tend to operate by establishing a large number of sub-
sidiary organizations incorporated in different countries. The relationship 
between the subsidiaries and the parent company are often quite opaque. 
So, too, are the transfer pricing arrangements by which transnational 
pharmaceutical companies set the prices of the products they provide to 
their subsidiaries in other jurisdictions. Manipulation of transfer pricing 
(by setting arbitrary prices for intra-­company transactions) has long been 
a strategy transnational corporations have used to minimise the profits 
of subsidiaries in higher tax countries while moving taxable income to 
­countries with lower tax rates.17

BOX 8.1  PFIZER: A CASE STUDY OF A TRANSNATIONAL 
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY
As one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies, Pfizer provides a useful 
case study demonstrating the transnational nature of the industry. Pfizer’s head 
office is based in New York, but the majority of its manufacturing takes place in 
Ireland, representing an investment of over US$7 billion in that country.18 Its Global 
Financial Services Centre and Global Treasury are also located there. The bulk 
of Pfizer’s R&D activity, however, takes place in the United States and the United 
Kingdom. With almost 600 subsidiaries in many different countries,19 Pfizer has 
grown to its current size partly through a large number of mergers and acquisitions – 
the most recent being Hospira, a large generic company acquired in 2015. For the 
first six months of 2014 Pfizer Inc. (the US parent company) reported revenues of 
more than $24 million and net income of over $5.2 million.20 This represents a tiny 
fraction of the income of the global conglomerate. The combined reported revenues 
of Pfizer Inc. and its subsidiary companies were $49.6 billion in 2014, and its net 
income was $9.1 billion (18.4 per cent of revenues).21 In November 2015, Pfizer 
announced its intention to merge with Allergan, a company based in Ireland, to 
create the world’s biggest pharmaceutical company.22 This merger, which would 
have enabled the establishment of the merged company’s base in Ireland (which 
has a much lower company tax rate), was expected to reduce its US tax liability by 
tens of billions of dollars.23 Plans for the merger were later abandoned following a 
change to US tax rules for corporations.24

These practices recently came under scrutiny in Australia during a Senate 
inquiry into corporate tax avoidance. A Parliamentary Library report 
provided to the Senate Committee, according to a June 2015 article in the 
Sydney Morning Herald,25 reported that ‘The five biggest ­suppliers of pub-
licly subsidised medicines in Australia recorded sales of nearly $5 billion 
last year but paid an average of just $10 million each in company tax.’
Pfizer was one of the companies brought before the Inquiry. Fairfax 
Media reported in 201426 that ‘Pfizer’s cost of sales as a percentage of reve-
nues is four times higher in Australia than in the United States.’ In a public 
hearing before the Senate Inquiry, representatives of Pfizer described the 
company’s affiliations as follows:
Pfizer Australia Holdings is owned by a combination of two Netherlands com-
panies and a Luxembourg company. They hold particular portions of shares. 
The ultimate holding company of those companies is Pfizer Inc. That is a US 
company.27
Asked to describe the origins of the company’s drugs, the Chairman and 
Managing Director of Pfizer Australia Pty Ltd responded: ‘of 90 per cent 
of our medicines, 67 per cent come from Ireland; I think 14 per cent or 
15  per cent from Singapore; and eight per cent from Spain; the other 
10 per cent come from various sources.’28
Citizens for Tax Justice reported in 201429 that:
Over the past five years for example, [Pfizer] has reported that it lost about 
$14.5 billion in the United States, while at the same time it earned about 
$75.5 billion abroad. Is the United States just a really bad market for Pfizer? It’s 
unlikely given that Pfizer also reports that around 40 per cent of its revenues are

generated in the United States. The more realistic explanation is that Pfizer is 
aggressively using transfer pricing and other tax schemes to shift its profits into 
offshore tax havens.
Pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer, also function as members of 
industry associations in the countries in which they are based. Operating as 
a collective of business interests, it is primarily through these associations 
that they exert influence on international trade agreements.
Industry Associations
The research-­based pharmaceutical industry is represented by industry 
associations in many countries, such as the Pharmaceutical Research and 
Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and the European Federation of 
Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA). The International 
Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) 
represents the industry’s interests at the global level.
At the time of writing, PhRMA’s membership included 31 biopharma-
ceutical (pharmaceutical and biotechnology) companies and 16 ‘research 
associate members’.30 The membership of industry associations in 
­countries like Australia and New Zealand is primarily comprised of 
subsidiaries of transnational pharmaceutical companies. For example, in 
2014, at least 12 of Medicines New Zealand’s 19 full member organisations 
were ­affiliated with corporations that were also members of PhRMA.31
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY STRATEGIES TO 
MAXIMISE PROFITS
The business model of the pharmaceutical industry, which seeks to 
­maximise profits and returns to shareholders, is often in direct conflict 
with the public health model, which focuses on the health, safety and 
well-­being of entire populations. The two models do not sit comfortably 
together, and tension between them threatens the ability of governments 
to provide equitable and affordable healthcare for their citizens. Healthcare 
systems throughout the world rely heavily on medications and vaccines for 
preventing and treating infectious diseases and chronic health conditions.

230    Research handbook on transnational corporations
Expenditure on pharmaceutical products in the United States has 
increased exponentially in the past 15–20 years and accounts for a substan-
tial part of healthcare expenditure.32 Spending is largely driven by branded 
and patented drugs, which are generally priced much higher than generics, 
accounting for 20 per cent of prescriptions, but 80 per cent of costs.33 In 2011, 
the National Health Service in the UK spent £13.6 billion (US$21 billion) on 
medicines, of which about £10 billion was spent on branded or proprietary 
products.34 This problem of rising prescription drug costs has become a crit-
ical health policy issue. For example expenditure on just two new products 
used to treat hepatitis C, Sovaldi and Harvoni, amounted to $12.4 billion in 
the United States in 2014. Existing patents on the two products, held by the 
manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, will not expire until 2028.35
The extent to which the pharmaceutical industry strategy puts ­self-­interest 
and profit ahead of public health has become the subject of ­specialized sci-
entific enquiry attracting highly regarded researchers. In his recent book 
Deadly Medicines and Organised Crime: How Big Pharma has Corrupted 
Healthcare, Peter Gøtzsche (a physician and head of the Nordic Cochrane 
Centre) convincingly argues that the pharmaceutical industry has corrupted 
the scientific process to exaggerate the benefits and ­downplay the harms of 
its products.36 Many other books and ­peer-­reviewed articles, for example 
by Dr Ben Goldacre and the former editors of the New England Journal 
of Medicine, have reached similar conclusions and, in addition, provide 
­comprehensive analysis of industry strategy to maximise profits.37, 38, 39

employed by the pharmaceutical industry to maximise profits. The indus-
try’s substantial financial resources also enable it to further its own 
interests through extensive (and expensive) political lobbying. We do not 
attempt a comprehensive account here but provide some examples of the 
types of strategies used by the industry, in order to contextualise the indus-
try’s efforts in relation to trade agreements, specifically the Trans Pacific 
Partnership Agreement.
Landmark legal cases brought by the US Department of Justice have 
highlighted the extent to which the largest drug companies have repeat-
edly and systematically engaged in strategies of questionable legality 
to promote drug sales. These include ostensibly illegal promotion of 
medications for off-­label uses, misrepresentation of research results, with-
holding data on harms, and Medicaid and Medicare Fraud.40 These 
activities are widespread and recurrent. It is argued that some of these 
behaviours may be resistant to external regulatory approaches.41, 42 In 2012 
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) agreed to plead guilty and pay a record $3 billion 
in penalties for unlawful promotion of prescription drugs, failure to report 
safety data, and false price reporting. It also signed a 123-­page corporate 
integrity agreement with the US Department of Justice that regulates its 
activity for the next five years.43 Of the top 10 drug companies, in July 2012 
only Roche was not bound by such an agreement.44
Commenting on a recent legal case against AstraZeneca, US Attorney 
General Eric Holder said that illegal acts by drug companies ‘can put the 
public health at risk, corrupt medical decisions by healthcare providers, 
and take billions of dollars directly out of taxpayers’ pockets.’45

Promoting Off-­label Use of Medications
Off-­label prescribing refers to the use of a medication outside the indica-
tions approved by the regulatory authority; it is costly, potentially harmful 
and of questionable benefit.46 It is now clear that pharmaceutical com­
panies strongly encouraged off-­label prescribing at a time when this type of 
promotion was not permitted.47 Pharmaceutical companies have extended 
sales into unapproved indications and drug doses; a series of recent publi-
cations based on the analysis of whistle-­blower complaints, as well as civil 
and criminal charges, have exposed the use of systematic, sophisticated 
and far-­reaching promotional methods.48
The significant worldwide expansion in the use of atypical antipsychotic 
medications for off-­label indications illustrates the success of industry 
­marketing strategies over evidence-­based practice. Antipsychotic medi-
cations have a considerable side-­effect burden and are intended for the 
treatment of psychoses and psychotic spectrum disorders, which are rare 
conditions affecting around 2 per cent of the general population. They 
are licensed for few additional indications and not for the bulk of the 
­conditions for which they are prescribed.49 Monasterio et al noted that:
Antipsychotics global sales were US$25.4 billion and the seventh biggest thera-
peutic group in 2010; Seroquel™ (quetiapine), Zyprexa™ (olanzapine) and 
Abilify™ (aripiprazole) were the 5th, 10th and 13th biggest selling pharmaceu-
ticals, with sales of US$6.8; US$5.7 and US$5.4 billion respectively. Even recent 
record-­breaking fines imposed on the industry are unlikely to act as a significant 
deterrent in the face of such profitable sales.50
Pharmaceutical industry marketing appears to have influenced the rapid 
expansion in off-­label prescribing of psychotropic drugs to paediatric and 
adolescent populations, often by overstating benefits and obscuring known 
harms.51 This trend is occurring at a time when the US Food and Drug

Administration (FDA), by virtue of a recent court decision52 is ­planning to 
relax restrictions on off-­label advertising,53 despite being criticized for its poor 
monitoring of drug companies’ promotion of on-­label uses of medicines.54
Medical Ghostwriting and Withholding Data on Harms
Medical ‘ghostwriting’, a mechanism by which pharmaceutical com-
panies covertly author journal articles published under the bylines of 
academic researchers, has contributed to public health harms by manipu-
lating research data.55 For example, the influential Study 329, which stimu-
lated the prescribing of Specific Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) 
to ­adolescents, was ghostwritten, over-­stated benefits and ­withheld 
­information on harms.56
Outcome Reporting and Publication Bias in Industry-­sponsored Trials
The pharmaceutical industry designs, funds and controls a significant pro-
portion of medical research. It exerts considerable influence over the publi-
cation and dissemination of results, prescribing patterns, and the direction 
of subsequent clinical research. Although in the United States there are 
ethical and legal requirements to disclose research findings promptly, a 
recent report found that only 17 per cent of research funded by indus-
try was published within the legally required one-­year period.57 Selective 
reporting bias increases the likelihood that interventions will appear to 
be effective and safe when they are not. A number of examples illustrate 
this point, including the following: misleading reports of the effectiveness

statement of the increased cardiovascular risk associated with the use of 
medicines like rosiglitazone (Avandia) (for type II diabetes) and rofecoxib 
(Vioxx) (as an anti-­inflammatory); and withholding of clinical trial data 
regarding the limited efficacy of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for the prevention 
and treatment of influenza. Each of these examples of the industry selec-
tively reporting or misreporting its research findings has led to public harm 
and a considerable cost burden.58
Life-­cycle Management, ‘Evergreening’
Life-­cycle management occurs when a manufacturer extends market 
exclusivity (and thus delays market entry of cheaper generic products) 
by applying a range of strategies that include slight changes to formula-
tions or different salts of the same base, but without any requirement 
to show therapeutic superiority over the existing product. These new 
formulations can, nonetheless, be protected by additional patents. For 
example, eight commonly prescribed drugs subject to these evergreening 
strategies in the public hospital system of the canton of Geneva were 
estimated to cost an additional €30 million (over the generic selling 
price equivalent) between 2000 and 2008, without demonstrating any 
additional clinical benefits for the additional expenditure.59 Lifecycle 
­management of two medications (protease inhibitors) widely used 
worldwide for patients with HIV may extend their market exclusivity 
to 2028 – 12 years beyond the expiration of the patents on their base 
compounds.60
Legal Action against Licensing Authorities
In 2012 AstraZeneca filed a lawsuit against the FDA in a bid to delay the 
entry into the market of generic versions of the antipsychotic medication 
Seroquel. AstraZeneca argued that the generic versions should be required 
to carry the same warnings about the risks of high blood sugar levels

and suicidal ideation as the branded drug, and because these warnings 
were the result of the company’s own clinical trials, they were protected 
by a marketing exclusivity period. Although the lawsuit was eventu-
ally ­unsuccessful, this approach highlights the pharmaceutical industry’s 
­strategies to ­maintain monopoly for their products.61
Negotiating Settlements with Generic Companies
Despite the uncertain legal future of pay-­for-­delay settlements, manufac-
turers of originator medicines and generic-­drug manufacturers continue 
to enter into arrangements whereby financial settlements leave the patents 
intact and the generic version off the market. These outcomes result in 
substantial costs to patients and payers.62
Promotion
Recent estimates indicate that pharmaceutical companies spend as much 
as 25 per cent of their sales revenue on promotion and marketing – almost 
twice as much as they spend on R&D.63 The range of promotional activities 
include intense marketing to medical students and residents, contributions 
to continuing medical education and the development of clinical practice 
guidelines, and, in the United States and New Zealand, direct-­to-­consumer 
advertising.64 Pharmaceutical companies also commonly use drug coupons 
as a marketing tool to stimulate demand for brand-­name medications and 
reduce patient cost sharing.65
‘Disease mongering’, a process that extends the boundaries of what 
is considered illness in order to expand markets for new products and 
medical interventions, is another tactic taken by the industry. It can include

Lobbying for Expanded Intellectual Property Rights
Another strategy used by pharmaceutical companies to maximise profits 
and returns for shareholders – and a particularly important one in the 
context of the transnational corporation – is to lobby for expanded intel-
lectual property rights, including patent extensions and longer periods of 
protection of clinical test data. This strategy has been pursued both within 
nation states (particularly countries with large pharmaceutical sectors) and 
at the global level through international trade agreements.
The justification for granting intellectual property rights is to provide 
incentives for investment in R&D.67 ‘The cost of developing a new drug 
is high and must be compensated in order to stimulate innovation, which 
is in the public interest’, the argument goes. It is clearly in the interests of 
the research-­based pharmaceutical industry to lobby for strong intellectual 
property protections in order to prolong their monopolies and exclude 
competitors from the market. However, there is a trade-­off between pro-
viding monopoly rights and enabling access to affordable medicines.68 
Intellectual property rights are an imperfect instrument for promoting 
investment in R&D; while they may provide incentives for investment in 
therapies for chronic conditions in wealthy markets where there is a good 
return on investment, they do not stimulate development of vaccines and 
treatments primarily of benefit to people in developing countries.69
Jurisdictions where large transnational pharmaceutical companies are 
headquartered – particularly the United States, the European Union and 
Japan – tend to have stronger intellectual property protections for phar-
maceuticals than countries that are primarily importers of medicines. But

international trade agreements as a vehicle for altering domestic intellec-

tual property settings is leading to the rapid spread of strong IPRs around 
the globe.
Taken together, these findings must caution against allowing greater 
influence to be exerted by the pharmaceutical industry, through weakening 
of government drug pricing and reimbursement policies and changes to 
intellectual property laws, pursued through trade and investment agree-
ments. The industry’s history of aggressively pursuing opportunities to 
expand markets and maintain high prices suggests that any opportunities 
presented by trade negotiations will be fully exploited.

ATTEMPTS TO INCREASE INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY PROTECTIONS AND INFLUENCE 
PHARMACEUTICAL COVERAGE PROGRAMS 
THROUGH TRADE AGREEMENTS: FROM TRIPS 
TO THE TPP
The World Trade Organization’s TRIPS Agreement on Trade Related 
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which came into force in 
1995, represented a concerted and sustained effort by the pharmaceutical 
industry to achieve global harmonisation of intellectual property protec-
tions, which until then had been largely confined to developed countries.70 
Drahos describes how US pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer, 
played a key role in campaigning for the inclusion of intellectual property 
rights within trade agreements – a campaign that was pursued largely 
through national and international industry bodies and conservative think 
tanks.71 TRIPS represented a significant shift in global IP norms as it 
mandated 20-­year patent terms for both product and process patents, in 
all fields of technology.72 The global expansion of IP rights via TRIPS was 
hotly contested by non-­government organisations and some developing 
countries, however, and this resulted in the inclusion of key flexibilities 
allowing nation states significant leeway to determine the implementation

of the obligations in their respective domestic laws.73 The rights of member 
countries to utilise these flexibilities were re-­affirmed in the 2001 Doha 
Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health.74
Despite TRIPS establishing significant standards of protection globally, 
it fell well short of both US and pharmaceutical industry aspirations, par-
ticularly as it provided phase-­in provisions for less-­developed states, some 
of which were major producers of generic medicines. The two decades 
since TRIPS have seen successive efforts to ‘ratchet up’ IP standards, effec-
tively circumventing TRIPS through bilateral and plurilateral trade agree-
ments, particularly those involving the US and the European Union.75, 76 
‘TRIPS-­plus’ IP provisions have been key elements of a US post-­TRIPS 
agenda that effectively began with the Jordan-­US free trade agreement 
(FTA) in 2000.77 It has since advanced virtually unchecked, to the extent 
that the provisions of TRIPS seem modest in comparison with the US 
push in the TPP.
The ‘May 10’ Agreement: A Brief Interruption to the IP Trajectory
A notable exception to this trend occurred in 2007 with the bipartisan 
New Trade Policy agreed between Congress and the White House. The 
so-­called May 10 agreement moderated some of the more egregious IP 
demands pursued in US trade agreements, but was only available to some 
developing countries.78 The former expansionist trajectory was quickly 
restored, with the Korea–US Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) (concluded

of protection and enforcement of intellectual property, signatories nonetheless 
retained a number of important flexibilities in interpretation and implementation, 
including options to: determine the grounds for issuing compulsory licenses; allow 
parallel importation; apply general exceptions to infringement, such as ‘early 
working’ for regulatory approval of generic products (also known as the Bolar 
provision) or experimental use; and for developing countries, a longer transition 
periods for implementation of the treaty obligations.

The Australia-­US Free Trade Agreement: A New and Alarming Element
The negotiation of the Australia–US Free Trade Agreement (AUSFTA) in 
2003–2004 represented a shift in an alarming new direction. The AUSFTA 
negotiations represented the first US bid to introduce provisions intended 
to directly influence the operation of a pharmaceutical coverage program 
of another country.80 Through the AUSFTA, Washington attempted to 
undermine reimbursement formulary listing and pricing mechanisms and 
gain greater influence over pharmaceutical decision-­making in Australia’s 
national drug coverage program, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme 
(PBS). The PBS is an effective monopsony and operates a closed formulary 
with strict cost effectiveness criteria as a prerequisite for listing medicines. 
The industry legitimised the pursuit of such provisions in a free trade 
agreement by claiming that the PBS represented a technical barrier to trade 
in the Australian market. Australia fended off this attempt, however, and 
successfully protected the drug selection and pricing mechanisms of the 
PBS, acceding only to changes in process and transparency, many of which 
were either already in process or planned. Nevertheless, the inclusion 
of provisions targeting a pharmaceutical coverage program set a highly 
unfortunate precedent, and the United States was able to introduce more 
intrusive provisions in the 2007 KORUS Agreement.81
A Brave New World: The Trans Pacific Partnership
The commencement of the Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations in 
2010 – an ambitious multilateral trade and investment agreement ­involving 
the United States and 11 other countries around the Pacific rim, in aggre-
gate representing 40 per cent of the global economy – provided a new 
forum for the further expansion of IP protections. Not surprisingly, initial 
US proposals included a wide range of substantially TRIPS-­plus (as well 
as AUSFTA and KORUS plus) provisions. Text leaked in February 2011 
showed the US seeking to require parties to make patents available for 
new forms of existing products, without requiring any demonstration

of improved efficacy or performance, and the elimination of exclusions 
from patent–ability (preserved in both the AUSFTA and KORUS) for 
­diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods of treatment. The leaked 
text also showed the US seeking extensions to patent terms to compensate 
both for delays in the granting of patents and in the marketing approval 
processes, with extensions required not just for molecule patents but also 
for method and use patents.82 Other draft provisions included the elimina-
tion of pre-­grant patent opposition; minimum periods of data exclusivity 
of five years for new products and three years for new uses of existing 
products;83 and a patent linkage provision that included a requirement for 
drug regulatory authorities to scan for existing patents, provide notifica-
tion to patent holders and delay marketing approval until the conclusion 
of dispute settlement proceedings.84 The text also contained a placeholder 
for a separate data exclusivity provision for biologics to be added at a 
later stage. Washington, as anticipated, was seeking a period of 12 years, 
consistent with the period of exclusivity conferred on these products in the 
United States.85
In addition to expanding IP protections, successive leaked texts revealed 
US ambitions in relation to the pharmaceutical coverage programs of its 
TPP partners.86 An initial US proposal for an annex to the ‘Transparency’ 
chapter (‘the Transparency Annex’), applying to pharmaceutical products 
and medical devices, articulated a number of provisions intended to con-
strain TPP countries in setting drug coverage policies and their approaches 
to selecting and pricing the medicines to be covered.87 While several TPP 
countries do not yet have coverage or reimbursement programs in place, 
the draft provisions appeared to target New Zealand’s Pharmaceutical

include drugs, blood products, tissues and vaccines. Biological medicines are typic­

United States biologics currently receive four years of data exclusivity and a total 
12 years of market exclusivity.

Management Agency (PHARMAC) and Australia’s PBS. If agreed to, the 
provisions would have seriously circumscribed both these programs, and 
any program other TPP partners might have chosen to develop in future.
The US ambitions did not go unchecked, however. The final text of the 
Transparency Annex88 reveals that many of the more problematic demands 
had been withdrawn or mitigated in the course of negotiations. The final 
Annex is largely similar to AUSFTA Annex 2-­C, albeit capturing medical 
devices (although these are exempted for some parties including Australia 
and New Zealand) as well as medicines. While it will not require changes 
to Australia’s PBS, it will require PHARMAC to introduce administra-
tive changes including a review process and a specified ­timeframe for 
­considering applications.
There has also been substantial evolution in the pharmaceutical provi-
sions of the IP chapter, with leaks of later iterations of the text showing a 
significant degree of resistance among the other TPP parties. This resist-
ance led to the tabling of a (largely TRIPS-­consistent) counterproposal 
in 2013 and the withdrawal or moderation of some of the provisions in 
2014.89
Nevertheless, text leaked by Wikileaks and published by Knowledge 
Ecology International in mid-­2015 revealed that crucial elements of the 
US proposal had remained to the final stages of the negotiations.90 By 
mid-­2015, a key obstacle to the conclusion of the agreement lay with US 
demands for data exclusivity for biologics, despite suggestions of a US 
‘compromise’ of eight years.91 However, with the exception of Japan and 
Canada, this still represented a substantial increase in the monopoly periods 
for these very expensive products, with some TPP countries having only five

years of ­exclusivity in place, and others, none at all. Despite the US Trade 
Representative’s ongoing push for prolonged exclusivity for biologics, suc-
cessive White House budgets have sought a reduction of the term within 
the US from 12 to seven years. The 2016 White House budget proposal esti-
mates that reducing data protection to seven years, together with prohibiting 
additional periods of exclusivity for biologics due to minor re-­formulations, 
would save $16 billion in federal spending alone over the next decade.92
The final text of the TPP’s intellectual property chapter93 reveals that 
the initial US proposals were significantly pared back in the final stages of 
the negotiations. However, the pharmaceutical industry was successful in 
securing many provisions which extend and entrench monopoly periods, 
such as mandatory secondary patents (Article 18.37.2), patent term exten-
sions (Arts. 18.46 and 18.48) and data exclusivity (Arts. 18.50 and 18.51). 
The final biologics provisions (Art. 18.51) are problematic and ambiguous, 
with a ‘two-­track’ outcome that appears to commit parties to eight years of 
market exclusivity for biologics whichever option they choose. While several 
developing countries have secured transition periods to implement some of 
the chapter’s more onerous provisions, these are both short and inflexible.
The TPP will also provide an opportunity for the pharmaceutical 
industry to contest future national pharmaceutical policy-­making, which 
recent experience suggests will be quickly exploited. The TPP’s investment 
chapter94 includes an investor–state dispute settlement clause allowing 
foreign corporations to sue governments for monetary compensation if 
they perceive that a policy change has affected the value of their invest-
ments. Investments are defined very broadly and include intellectual 
property rights. Eli Lilly and Company, a US-­based pharmaceutical 
company, has used a similar mechanism in the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA) to seek CAD $500 million in compensation after 
Canadian courts invalidated patents for two of its drugs.95

THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY: AGENDA 
SETTING IN THE TPP
The Influence of Big Pharma over the TPP Negotiations
The pharmaceutical industry96 has played a key role in shaping the US 
negotiating position in the TPP. This can be seen in the similarity between 
the initial US proposals for the intellectual property chapter of the TPP 
and the industry’s submissions to the USTR advocating for strong IP 
protections.97 Many commentators have suggested that the US proposals 
simply reflect an industry ‘wish list’.98, 99
How US-­based industry sought to influence the TPP negotiations
The pharmaceutical industry actively tried to shape the US position 
through direct input to the negotiations via several of the 28 US trade 
advisory committees. PhRMA is represented on the Industry Trade 
Advisory Committee on Intellectual Property Rights (ITAC15)100 which, 
at the time of writing, also had representatives from several pharmaceuti-
cal and biotechnology corporations including Gilead Sciences, Johnson 
and Johnson, as well as from the Biotechnology Industry Organization 
(BIO), but no representation from non-­government organisations or 
academics. The Industry Trade Advisory Committee on Chemicals, 
Pharmaceuticals, Health/Science Products and Services (ITAC3)101 and 
  96  The biotechnology sector has also been very important in this context, and 
to a large extent their interests and activities overlap with those of the pharmaceu-
tical industry. For the purpose of this chapter however, we focus specifically on the 
pharmaceutical industry.

These committees are comprised of cleared advisors who have access 
to the negotiating texts on which they are providing advice.103 An analysis 
of the membership of the trade advisory committees published in the 
Washington Post in February 2014104 indicated that 85 per cent of the trade 
advisors on these committees were industry representatives. In response 
to criticism about the imbalance, in February 2014 the USTR belatedly 
announced that it would establish a ‘Public Interest Trade Advisory 
Committee (‘the Committee’) to provide policy advice on issues involving 
trade and from the perspective of those concerned with public interest 
issues’,105 however this development has been greeted with some scepticism 
by non-­government organisations regarding the extent to which this could 
truly rebalance the input to USTR decision-­making.106
Other, less overt avenues of influence have also been demonstrated 
between the industry and the USTR. Confidential emails obtained by

executive sent a draft of a lobbying letter to USTR seeking comment.108 
Most tellingly, large sections of many emails were redacted, suggesting the 
email exchanges included a significant amount of confidential information 
concerning the issues under negotiation – a level of information to which 
non-­government stakeholders do not have access.
Commentators and researchers have also pointed out a longstand-
ing ‘revolving door’ between USTR and the industry, with USTR staff 
­frequently moving directly into industry from their USTR roles, and many 
USTR staff coming directly from industry positions.109 The Washington 
Post reported in November 2013 that ‘Since the turn of the century, 
at least a dozen USTR officials have taken jobs with pharmaceutical 
­companies, filmmakers, record labels, and technology companies that 
favor stronger patent and copyright protection’.110 The article documents 
several instances where longstanding, senior USTR officials had been 
engaged as ­pharmaceutical industry executives and vice versa.
The combination of close relationships between USTR and industry 
personnel, along with asymmetries in information access and ­opportunities 
for input between industry and non-­industry stakeholders can be seen to 
lead to a situation of ‘regulatory capture’.111 An elite set of domestic 
industry stakeholders with vested interests and direct input to the trade 
negotiating process is able to effectively manipulate government processes 
for its own ends:
This subset of IP stakeholders, with access to current information and the 
ability to discuss negotiating proposals with U.S. negotiators, is able to nudge 
the law in free trade agreements toward the kind of IP law they would prefer 
existed domestically. Accordingly, the making of international IP law has been 
captured through the U.S. trade negotiating regime.112
This regulatory capture is exacerbated by certain institutional and 
­governance features of USTR:

By statutory design and by some chance, the USTR is not subject to the same 
transparency, input or oversight requirements as other agencies. Consequently, 
the USTR is structurally subject to information capture by its limited industry 
advisors, with little or no countervailing textual input by opposing industries, 
the public, or public interest groups.113
The absence of transparency, in particular, undermines both account-
ability and legitimacy with the public. At the international level, Kaminski 
argues that it ‘co-­opts the authority of the United States on the interna-
tional stage for private interests’.114 Jasso-­Aguilar and Waitzkin observe 
that ‘In many instances the U.S. government has acted more as a sales 
representative, aggressively promoting U.S. corporations’ interests abroad, 
rather than as a political negotiator.’115
In addition to direct avenues of influence through the USTR, the indus-
try also uses more traditional lobbying avenues. The Sunlight Foundation 
undertook an analysis of lobbying reports in 2014 and found that the 
pharmaceutical industry (including its industry associations) had been by 
far the most active industry in lobbying for the TPP:
From 2009 until mid-­2013 (the time during which the language of the 
­agreement was still reasonably fluid), drug companies and associations men-
tioned the trade agreement in 251 separate lobbying reports – two and a half 
times more than the next most active industry (at least measured by lobbying 
reports).116
As would be expected, PhRMA was the most vocal, topping the list 
of organisations (across all industries) with the most lobbying reports 
­mentioning the TPP.117
The pharmaceutical industry spends large amounts of money on 
­lobbying: data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics indicates 
that the ‘pharmaceuticals and health products’ industry spent a total 
of almost $231 million on lobbying in 2014 alone, with PhRMA the

campaign contributions (to both Democrats and Republicans) in the 
2013–2014 financial year.119 It is hardly surprising in this context that a 
key component of pharmaceutical industry strategy in the context of the 
TPP ­negotiations was to persuade members of Congress to write letters 
advocating for strong intellectual property protections, such as the 2011 
letter from 40 Members of Congress to President Obama120 and another in 
2015 to Ambassador Froman, the United States Trade Representative.121 
Public interest organisation Knowledge Ecology International obtained, 
via a Freedom of Information Act request to the USTR, a total of 13 
letters from members of Congress advocating for stronger monopolies on 
­biologics sent during the period 27 July 2011 to 8 August 2013.122
Pharmaceutical industry influence in countries other than the US
The degree of influence of the pharmaceutical industry over the negotiat-
ing positions of the other TPP countries appears to have been far more 
limited, with the possible exception of Japan, which has its own large, 
research-­based pharmaceutical industry. Japan’s domestic ­intellectual 
property laws already include a range of TRIPS+ intellectual property 
protections, and its negotiating position in the 2014 leaked TPP intellectual 
property chapter was more closely aligned with the US position than that 
of any of the other countries (and vice versa).123
In Australia and New Zealand, the local industry associations 
(Medicines Australia and Medicines New Zealand) have both echoed some 
of PhRMA’s demands in the TPP. For example, for some years, Medicines 
Australia has been lobbying for extensions to data protection, ­particularly

Agreement.124 Medicines New Zealand has been primarily seeking changes 
to PHARMAC’s processes, arguing for greater transparency and industry 
input to decision-­making.125
PHARMA LOBBYING AND THE USE OF DISCOURSE
The patent-­holding pharmaceutical industry uses a particular common 
rhetoric in its efforts to influence trade negotiations. The language used 
entirely masks its business interests. Instead, it promotes the industry 
as working in the interests of national, even international, economic 
development and in favour of population health.
Framing the Issues as Problems: TPP as the Solution
In a study of industry discourse with regard to the TPP, Neuwelt, Gleeson 
and Mannering asked the question ‘How has the industry used language 
and ideas to attempt to influence the TPP negotiations?’126 We undertook 
a critical discourse analysis127 of publicly available texts about the TPP 
­produced by peak bodies representing the Industry in the United States 
and New Zealand (NZ): the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers 
of America (PhRMA) and Medicines New Zealand (Medicines NZ, for-
merly the Researched Medicines Industry or RMI). Documents analysed 
included submissions to trade negotiating authorities, media releases and 
annual reports. Documents dated between November 2008 and March 
2013 were identified through website searches.
We found that PhRMA and Medicines NZ portrayed the TPP provisions 
as needing to address a number of ‘problems’. First, the TPP would tackle the 
supposed ‘unfair’ treatment of the industry by governments (outside of the

United States), and the resulting restricted access to ­‘innovative medicines’. 
Second, the TPP would address the US economic crisis, in part by expanding 
the US-­based patent-­holding pharmaceutical industry. These ‘problems’, for 
which the TPP was regarded as the solution, were framed in particular ways. 
The industry was personified as the victim of unfair treatment, as the pro-
tector of the public good and as ­economic saviour for the US (and later, for 
other nations as well). These were the major discourses identified.
‘The Unfair Treatment of the Industry’
The industry personified itself as comprised of ‘researchers and innova-
tors’, who have received inequitable treatment by governments in com-
parison to the generic pharmaceutical industry. In so doing, its business 
agenda remained hidden, in the interests of persuading negotiators and 
government ministers that the United States is a victim of other nations’ 
overly restrictive regulatory environments. As each nation applied to the 
Office of the USTR to enter into the TPP negotiations, PhRMA made 
a submission critiquing that nation’s ‘climate for innovative medicines’, 
identifying the ways its regulatory environment unfairly limited the US 
industry’s ability to market ‘new’ medicines. Further, PhRMA expressed 
clear expectations that the TPP provisions would ensure that no TPP 
nation could offer preferential regulatory treatment to its own local phar-
maceutical ­manufacturers, over US-­based transnational pharmaceutical 
companies.
PhRMA’s call for stronger intellectual property protections was said to 
be a response to the ‘need to be doing more to champion researchers and 
innovators who rely on strong [intellectual property] protections’.128 These 
‘people’ were represented to be victims whose rights have not, to date, been 
adequately protected by governments beyond the United States. In a 2009 
submission to the USTR, PhRMA stated:
PhRMA believes that the TPP FTA negotiations [. . .] could help ensure that 
US-­based biopharmaceutical products have as fair and equitable access to 
foreign markets as foreign products have to ours.129

250    Research handbook on transnational corporations
This language of fairness and equity extended to the framing of 
PHARMAC activities in New Zealand. In a 2008 submission about 
the TPP to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Researched 
Medicines Industry Association (Medicines NZ’s predecessor) complained 
about perceived inequities in PHARMAC’s processes. It cast the industry 
in the role of victim and suggested a punitive (and therefore unfair) motive 
for PHARMAC’s activities.
‘The Industry as Global Protector of Patient Rights, Public Good and 
Economic Development’
In both PhRMA and Medicines NZ documents discussing the TPP, the 
industry presented PHARMAC’s processes as a breach not only of indus-
try rights, but also of patient rights – by delaying patient access to newer, 
­so-­called innovative medicines. It failed to mention the inequitable impact 
of high-cost medicines, in general, and on people’s access to medicines. 
Further, the industry represented itself as contributing to the global public 
good, and to US economic security, through the development of new medi-
cines. In positioning itself as protector of the public good, PhRMA used 
­language to set up a ‘crisis’ that PhRMA, through the TPP, would solve. 
For example, PhRMA referred to itself as ‘offering new hope to those suf-
fering from life-­threatening disease or disability’.130 The sense of urgency 
created in language, such as ‘timely access to medicines for patients’, framed 
stronger IP protection as being imperative in order to save lives now.
What remains unsaid is that every day of delay in getting a medicine to 
market costs the industry millions of dollars in revenue. Further, claims 
about the TPP leading to economic growth, jobs and prosperity in the TPP 
countries were often made in the same sentences as claims about health 
outcomes. The TPP was presented as a ‘win–win’ for population health and 
economic development:
Such policies will help ensure timely patient access to advanced life-­saving 
medical discoveries, support improvements in quality of life and productivity, 
and serve as an engine for future economic growth.131

Transnational pharmaceutical industry; the Trans Pacific Partnership    ­251
In a US Business Association letter to the US president, PhRMA made 
unsubstantiated claims that all trading nations would benefit equally from 
the TPP, as in the following quote:
the adoption of strong IP protections by all countries in the TPP more widely 
promotes strong benefits for all132
Medicines NZ also claimed that stronger IP protections in the TPP would 
explicitly benefit the New Zealand economy. However, since the pharma-
ceutical industry in NZ largely comprises branch offices of ­transnational 
corporations, the talk of harnessing innovative ideas for NZ’s economic 
benefit obscures the real transnational beneficiaries of such arrangements.
Re-­defining ‘Access to Medicines’ in Its Own Interests
The study found that PhRMA and Medicines NZ had redefined the term 
‘access to medicines’ to mean ‘access to new (on-­patent) medicines’. The 
term usually refers to people having equitable access to affordable medi-
cines. Access to medicines is generally defined by organisations such as the 
World Health Organization in terms of ‘equitable availability and afford-
ability of essential drugs’.133 The industry’s reconstruction of the term was 
designed to gain support from clinicians, policy-­makers and ­politicians; 
perhaps also from patient groups concerned about access to new medi-
cines, for example for rare diseases. The conflation of terms, or inten-
tional re-­construction of their meaning, is evident in a recent Medicines 
NZ study. The term ‘waiting list’, usually reserved for patients waiting to 
receive healthcare, is used to refer to the ‘unfair’ time that medicines wait 
for public funding by PHARMAC in New Zealand.134
Neuwelt, Gleeson and Mannering noted that the industry’s personifica-
tion of itself as both victim (of regulation) and protector (of patients, of a 
healthy economy) appeared to be directed at a number of audiences. While 
discourses were aimed at convincing the Office of the USTR to prosecute

its case in the negotiations, some were also aimed at the medical profes-
sion, patient groups lobbying for increased access to high cost new medi-
cines, and members of the US Congress. The industry’s use of language to 
appeal to a sense of ‘fair play’ in international trade actually obscured that 
the policies promoted by industry would likely have the effect of decreas-
ing access to medicines and health equity for already-­disadvantaged 
­population groups.135, 136 The industry’s agenda for the TPP would reduce 
access to medicines globally, by ensuring that the IP rights of the industry 
are paramount to the rights of patients to be able to access affordable 
medicines.
The discourses identified by Neuwelt, Gleeson and Mannering con-
tinue to be evident in industry statements on the TPP since 2013. In fact, 
the industry language is also evident in politicians’ letters to President 
Obama about pharmaceutical patent protection in the TPP, USTR reports 
and even in leaked TPP chapters. Industry influence in the negotiations, 
direct and indirect, is expressed in the similarity of the language and ideas 
­presented in each. Some examples will now be provided.
The PhRMA website137 contains articles which make strong assertions 
about biologics. A US proposal to extend the period of data exclusivity 
on biologic medicines was still ‘on the table’ in the TPP negotiations at 
the final stages. However, even more pertinent to this discussion are the 
letters to the US President or to the USTR about the TPP published on 
the website. Eighteen letters dated between 2011 and 2015, and signed by 
governors, senators and other members of Congress, strongly urged the 
US President or the USTR to ensure 12 years of exclusivity for biologic 
drugs as part of the intellectual property settings in the TPP. By 2015, for 
the first time, the letters contained national figures on biopharmaceutical 
­industry ­employment and economic output, suggesting increasing PhRMA 
­desperation to influence this aspect of the negotiations. Discourses in the 
letters parallel those of the industry, as is evident in the following excerpt 
from a May 2015 letter signed by 11 US senators:

Transnational pharmaceutical industry; the Trans Pacific Partnership    ­253
The US innovative biologics industry supports 3.4 million US jobs and exports 
of $50 billion worth of medicines each year. These treatments offer new hope to 
patients suffering from cancer, arthritis, and rare diseases . . . Biologics are the 
future of medicine . . . Not offering adequate protections that will continue to 
spur innovation and investment will ultimately lead to companies taking fewer 
risks, and patients globally not receiving treatments that may have been devel-
oped under an appropriate standard. We strongly believe that standard should 
be 12 years.138
The industry discourse was also mirrored by the Office of the USTR in its 
2015 annual Special 301 Report dealing with intellectual property issues. 
PHARMAC was explicitly identified as a target:
With respect to New Zealand, U.S. industry has expressed serious con-
cerns about the policies and operation of New Zealand’s Pharmaceutical 
Management Agency (PhARMAC), including, among other things, the lack 
of transparency, fairness, and predictability of the PhARMAC pricing and 
reimbursement regime, as well as the negative aspects of the overall climate for 
innovative medicines in New Zealand.139
The industry language of ‘negative climates for innovative medicines’ had 
been adopted, along with the discourse of equity with regard to pharma-
ceutical regulations.
CONCLUSION
The contemporary large pharmaceutical company is typically a trans­
national conglomerate with a head office in one state, R&D and manu-
facturing activities in several and a large number of subsidiaries scattered 
across the globe. These corporations and their industry associations 
employ a variety of strategies to maximise their profits and the returns for 
their shareholders.
An increasingly important strategy for the industry is the pursuit 
of expanded intellectual property rights at the global level through 
­international trade agreements. Trade negotiations provide fertile ground 
for pharmaceutical industry lobbying, particularly in the United States

where regulatory capture is enabled by close relationships between the 
trade negotiating authority and industry, opaque negotiating processes, 
and advisory structures that allow privileged access to industry. The con-
sequences of this capture can be seen in the ‘ratcheting up’ of IPRs in suc-
cessive US free trade agreements, culminating in the US proposals for the 
Trans Pacific Partnership.
The industry also employs a range of rhetorical devices and discursive 
flourishes – terms such as ‘access to medicines’ and ‘win–win outcomes’ – 
to persuade policy-­makers to adopt its proposals, while attempting to 
obscure its strategic objectives in the TPP negotiations. Much of this 
rhetoric has been reflected in recent letters from members of Congress to 
President Obama, as well as in the negotiating positions taken by USTR, 
indicating that it has been influential at least in the US. This rhetoric, 
however, has been contested in many of the non-­US TPP countries, which 
generally put up strong resistance to the US proposals, at least until the 
late stages of the negotiations. Despite this resistance and the resulting 
mitigation of some provisions, many key objectives of the pharmaceutical 
industry were still achieved in the final text of the TPP.

Samsung, human rights and consumer electronics manufacturing9.  A case in supply chain and business 
sustainability: Samsung’s management 
of human rights in consumer electronics

Anna Chou
INTRODUCTION
The United Nations’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 proclaimed 
the world’s obligation to combat human rights abuses in 1948. Actors on 
the global stage are now accountable for human rights abuses in a number 
of different ways. In today’s globalized economy, though national sover-
eigns remain primarily responsible for the protection of human rights, 
transnational corporations (TNCs) also have a responsibility to respect 
human rights in their business operations. John Ruggie’s ‘Protect, Respect 
and Remedy’ framework outlines principles for collaboration among 
States and corporations.2 In particular, TNCs should evaluate and manage 
potential implications of their activities on human rights. Ruggie promotes 
that companies ‘must take proactive steps’ by performing ‘human rights 
impact assessments’ and integrating human rights policies.3 Specifically, 
they should define initiatives in their corporate social ­responsibility (CSR) 
programs.
The basic idea of corporate social responsibility is that business deci-
sions can be more than completely self-­serving. Companies use CSR strat-
egies to address social and environmental concerns while simultaneously 
pursuing business objectives.4 CSR challenges the traditional ­definition 
of marketing because the impact and intention extends beyond the

­relationship of the consumer and corporation to the world at large. The 
typical understanding of marketing is an exclusive relationship between a 
company and its target consumer. Marketing campaigns are for economic 
gains, an extrinsic motivation for enterprises. CSR, however, is about 
accomplishing a good in addition to profit.
The global consumer electronics supply chain requires consideration 
of human rights impacts because of concerns for conflict minerals and 
worker conditions. The need for minerals ties many actors and interest 
groups into a complex problem in the consumer electronics industry. 
Mineral sourcing raises issues of the political economy, consumerism and 
profit-­driven decision-­making. Among the many stakeholders, manu-
facturing companies emerge as very important players. Their operations 
depend on minerals as production inputs. This case study evaluates 
Samsung Electronics’s efforts to prevent human rights abuses in its supply 
chain. The profits earned from selling minerals to Samsung can be con-
nected to violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and 
surrounding countries. Human rights considerations concern the relation-
ship between mineral trade and civil conflict as well as worker rights more 
broadly. First, an overview of conflict minerals provides the foundation 
for this discussion. This evaluates the local and political structure in the 
DRC. The problem arises from conditions in the local area but is further 
fueled by consumers and corporations from afar. Understanding the 
nature of this issue frames it as a corporate social responsibility concern. 
After establishing the need to address conflict minerals, codes of conduct 
and publications from the United Nations, the International Conference 
of the Great Lakes Region, and national governments provide a frame-
work for approaching the problem. These guidelines establish a refer-
ence point to judge and analyze Samsung’s actions. Samsung’s own 2014 
sustainability report was the primary source used to understand its CSR 
activities. This study answers the question of how a company can set up 
its strategy and operations to protect against human rights risks in its 
supply chain.
Case studies serve to spark a conversation and provoke further critical 
thinking. Reading theoretical literature on conflict mineral management 
and evaluating its practical application through Samsung’s business strat-
egy introduces readers to the tradeoffs in CSR strategies. It demonstrates 
that key values can conflict with each other, inviting readers to contemplate 
different facets of the decision-­making and judgment process. Specifically, 
modern-­day supply chain analyses demand a comparison of the cost of 
human rights violations against business profits. Furthermore, how can a 
firm’s culpability for human rights abuses be calculated in a multi-­linked 
and global supply chain? Finally, what intrinsic responsibilities do corpo-

rations hold while courting consumer demand? In hard circumstances, 
deciding on the best practice is a difficult task. First, without an over-
arching governing body, planning and executing a solution is challenging. 
Second, it is not easy to confirm if a particular plan of action was the best 
choice. Nevertheless, regardless of actually achieving the optimal result, it 
is important for firms to at least aspire to it.
EXPLAINING THE CORE ISSUE OF CONFLICT 
MINERALS
Before evaluating potential solutions and ensuing actions, we must first 
understand the nature of a problem. This phenomenon affects all players 
in the consumer electronics market. In this chapter, the term ‘conflict 
minerals’ describes minerals that are connected to human rights abuses in 
the Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries. The pro-
duction of modern-­day technological devices demands four key minerals: 
gold, tantalum, tungsten and tin.5 The DRC is abundant in these resources. 
However, these inputs are linked to armed groups and their ensuing 
violence in Congo. These rebel groups, not affiliated with the political 
sovereign, campaign for self-­serving economic and political objectives. The 
story starts in 1996 with a political and ethnic war between the Rwandan 
faction and the Congolese regime. The dispute evolved into a competition 
for control of the DRC’s natural resources. Three major groups vied for 
control in Congo: the Rwandan Hutu Democratic Forces for the Liberation 
of Rwanda (FDLR), the Rwanda and Uganda-­backed M23, and various 
local ‘Mai Mai’ groups.6 Since, efforts from the Congolese government and 
the United Nations ended the activities of M23 in 2013. Rebel groups need 
financial resources to perpetuate their campaigns and activities. The min-
erals in Congo are a major source of revenue for these groups. Competing 
against other armed groups, they use violence and intimidation tactics to 
maintain control of mines, resulting in disturbing human rights violations. 
These include murder, rape, child labor and recruitment of youth soldiers. 
Sales of minerals further sustain these atrocities. Rebel groups control and 
tax the mines as well as the illegal smuggle points.7 Because these minerals 
are in such high demand, trade is very lucrative. This income equips them

with more weapons and influence, further strengthening their ability to 
terrorize civilians. Estimates predict that armed rebel forces collectively 
funnel about US$183 million each year,8 an ample budget for continuing 
their activities. Conflict minerals taint the electronics supply chain with 
human rights abuses at the beginning acquisition stage.
The consumer electronics supply chain has several links. Conflict min-
erals are raw resources at the very beginnings of the supply chain. After 
their extraction in the DRC and the surrounding areas, minerals are sent 
to smelting companies in Thailand, Malaysia, China and India.9 Smelters 
combine large stocks of minerals during processing. There is no dis-
crimination among minerals imported from around the world. As a result, 
supply-­chain tracking is challenging. The smelting process combines origi-
nal inputs from many different mines. Once the minerals are smuggled out 
of Congo and accepted by smelters in Asia, there is no way to distinguish 
between the conflict-­free and conflict minerals. Therefore, the refined 
forms of tin, tantalum, gold and tungsten have unknown levels of conflict-­
sourced inputs. Mineral tracing would have to follow resources from their 
origins at the mines to smelters and suppliers before reaching consumer 
electronics manufacturers. This multi-­step processing chain complicates 
attempts to remain conflict free.
Because the global supply chain network is distant and widespread, it 
creates an illusion of moral disconnect, forming a screen that absolves 
actors of their responsibility. The problem is geographically far removed, 
which creates a misleading psychological effect. Because corporations and 
consumers do not see or experience the violence in Africa, the issue seems 
less pressing. However, location is a morally arbitrary factor. Geographic 
distance does not dilute the intensity of human rights atrocities happen-
ing in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Consumers who demand these 
products are physically far removed from the effects in the DRC. Yet, their 
connection to conflict minerals is very direct. Furthermore, the complexity 
of having many actors obscures the responsibility of each. Actors in the 
supply chain might try to assign fault to others also involved. Therefore, 
they are less likely to initiate resolution. The lack of ownership in the 
supply chain thus perpetuates the conflict mineral crisis.

CURRENT CODES OF CONDUCT, REGULATIONS 
AND CERTIFICATION SYSTEMS
The human rights abuses that arise from this situation are grave. Efforts 
to address the conflict mineral crisis in Congo come from several different 
channels: the United Nations, international non-­governmental organiza-
tions (NGOs) and national governments. Pressure to address conflict 
minerals comes from consumers and grassroots activist groups. However, 
they are not key players in designing and coordinating resolution for these 
problems. They initiate awareness but lack resources, organization and 
authority to hold the supply chain accountable. This section examines the 
actors involved in conflict mineral resolution. The position and efforts of 
the United Nations mark a starting point. Following, the focus zooms 
in to understand local efforts from the International Conference on the 
Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) in Africa. These organizations offer mere 
recommendations of conduct, lacking legal backing. On the other hand, 
governments have also taken action against conflict minerals. Particularly, 
these are policies from the United States, European Union and China. 
Additionally, understanding the requirements of different certification 
schemes highlights the high-­risk links in the mineral supply chain. This 
achieves a grasp of the current status quo.
INTERNATIONAL CODES OF CONDUCT
International and non-­governmental organizations provide guidance for 
managing conflict minerals. Their recommendations establish a paradigm 
of what should be done. However, without legitimate sovereignty, they 
lack a viable system to enforce or monitor compliance. There is no legal 
obligation for firms to act in accordance with these guidelines. Therefore, 
for firms to abide, they must be motivated, either by the desire for a 
­competitive advantage or a sense of obligation.
These standards are important to the discussion of responsible supply 
chain strategy because they provide guidance for its content. For cor-
porations starting their discussion of how to manage conflict minerals, 
standards provide guidance and suggestions of best practices. These 
standards are written in the context of today’s business environment, 
taking into account particular opportunities and threats corporations 
face. They highlight issues that corporations must anticipate to remain 
viable in the future. However, these recommendations require nothing of 
companies. Without a threat of punishment for non-­compliance, they lack 
legal weight. Nevertheless, these standards cannot be disregarded. Written

in the context of current events and developments, they remain relevant 
because they illuminate salient issues for corporations to address.
Resolutions and Undertakings from the United Nations
The United Nations has established a discourse on corporate social 
responsibility and transnational corporations. In 2000, the UN Global 
Compact outlined guidelines of proper and ethical business practices for 
21st-­century enterprises. This is the largest initiative for corporate social 
responsibility. Its official statement of purpose is to call ‘companies 
everywhere to voluntarily align their operations and strategies with ten 
universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labor, envi-
ronment, and anti-­corruption.’10 The Global Compact’s ten principles 
outline the ideals. The first two principles regarding human rights set 
the foundation for later publications on conflict mineral management. 
Explicitly, the Global Compact explains that ‘businesses should support 
and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights; 
and make sure that they are not complicit in human rights abuses.’11 
Coming from an organization of international collaborators, this pub-
lication prioritized the need address human rights infringements in 
­business operations.
The UN followed up with literature specific to the exploitation of 
natural resources. In 2001, the UN Security Council produced the ‘Report 
of the Panel of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources 
and Other Forms of Wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.’ 
It explains the pre-­existing and current structures that enable the exploi-
tation of minerals, agriculture, forests and ivory products in the DRC. 
Furthermore, it clarifies the classification of illegality as any violation of 
existing laws and regulations or the disregard of sovereignty. It explains 
that any extraction, production, commercialization or export of Congo’s 
natural resources is illegal if it occurs without the consent of the legitimate 
government.12 Evaluating the link between the exploitation and con-
tinuing conflict, there are six general categories of recommendations for 
resolution:

(1)	 Sanctions against countries and individuals involved in the illegal 
activities;
(2)	 preventative measures to avoid a recurrence of the current situation;
(3)	 reparations to the victims of the illegal exploitation of natural 
resources;
(4)	 design of a framework for reconstruction;
(5)	 improvement of international mechanisms and regulations governing 
some natural resources; and
(6)	 security issues.13
Sanctions are a method of reducing the demand for conflict minerals 
and exploited natural resources. There are several types of sanctions. 
The first is a restriction on imports and exports of Congo’s natural 
resources. Other countries that violate this embargo would face conse-
quences as well. Next, sanctions also include freezing the financial assets 
of rebel groups, corporations or individuals complicit in illegal activities. 
Finally, an embargo on imports of weapons to the DRC aims to reduce 
rebel groups’ power to terrorize civilians. Though the UN initiated 
these recommendations to address the problem in Congo, it depends 
on national governments to enforce them. This demonstrates the UN’s 
lack of authority to implement its policies. To address this dearth, 
MONUC (UN Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo) was formed in November 1999 to enforce the Lusaka 
Ceasefire Agreement of the Second Congo War.14 MONUC also served 
to oversee the implementation and acceptance of several UN Security 
Council resolutions. In July 2010, the Security Council aptly renamed 
MONUC to MONUSCO (UN Organization Stabilization Mission in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo) to reflect the advancements 
achieved in Congo. The mission of MONUSCO remained generally the 
same, working to protect civilians and supporting the DRC government 
against insurgents.15 This body provides force behind the UN’s efforts to 
maintain peace.
The UN’s initial report spoke broadly of natural resources in the DRC. 
About a decade later, in November 2010, Resolution 1952 substantiated 
the policies against conflict minerals in particular. It first reaffirmed 
many of the prior recommendations regarding sanctions. It highlighted

that the DRC government is primarily responsible for ‘ensuring security 
in its ­territory and protecting its civilians with respect to the rule of law, 
human rights and international humanitarian law’,16 but with support 
and collaboration from the international community. More significantly, 
however, it additionally addressed importers, processors and consumers, 
some of the many stakeholders involved in the supply chain. Each con-
tributes to the human rights abuses that occur in the conflict minerals 
supply chain. As a result, resolving this issue requires a comprehensive 
effort.
Efforts from the United Nations are slowly making progress in ending 
the conflict and bringing peace and stability to the Democratic Republic 
of Congo. The United Nations, working with the Congolese government, 
successfully disarmed the M23 group on 5 November 2013.17 This is a 
small, but significant, milestone that demonstrates success in upholding 
the International Declaration of Basic Human Rights.
Collaboration Through the International Conference on the Great Lakes 
Region (ICGLR)
UN Resolution 1952 mentions the International Conference of the Great 
Lakes Region for its initiatives to promote peace and stability. ICGLR 
does this through a collaborative effort among the DRC and eleven sur-
rounding countries (Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic 
of Congo, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Republic of South Sudan, Sudan, 
Tanzania and Zambia).18 This intergovernmental organization, formed 
in 2000, works towards a vision of peace, security, democracy and 
development. It is important because it establishes cooperation and 
solidarity among multiple sovereigns in the African Great Lakes Region. 
By broadening support behind the mission to achieve peace in Congo, 
rebel groups have fewer channels and options to continue their violent 
campaigns. Combining the efforts of many countries, the ICGLR set up 
programs to address peace and security, democracy and good governance, 
economic development and regional integration, humanitarian and social

issues, genocide prevention, and natural resources.19 As opposed to global, 
high-­level efforts from the United Nations, the ICGLR contributes solu-
tions as a local actor, representing the views of the people most impacted 
by worker rights and mining issues.
GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION TO REGULATE 
MINERALS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN
The United Nations and the ICGLR offer valuable discourse and valiant 
recommendations on the conflict mineral crisis. However, their initia-
tives lack enforcement capabilities. In contrast, sovereigns have legitimate 
power, as well as a duty to counter human rights abuses. This section evalu-
ates their legislative efforts to restrict and combat the conflict mineral crisis 
in the electronics supply chain. The world superpowers got involved in this 
issue because of the concern for international human rights. Typically, 
CSR activities are voluntary, proactive measures initiated by corporations 
as a means to achieve a competitive advantage. It is a form of market 
differentiation, creating a reputation that differs from comparable firms. 
Government regulation concerning conflict minerals aims to raise aware-
ness through disclosure and labeling. However, it is not a definitive ban 
against conflict minerals. Instead, this method might reduce demand by 
increasing consumer knowledge. Regulations and sanctions from gov-
ernment bodies can slowly starve rebel groups of the means to continue 
their activities. This theme underpins regulations by the United States, 
European Union, and China.
Requirements of the US SEC Dodd–Frank Act: Section 1502
The 2012 decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
reflects consumer transparency. The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act addresses conflict minerals in section 1502. This 
legislation, proposed and passed in 2010, requires ‘persons to disclose 
annually whether any conflict minerals that are necessary to the functional-
ity or production of a product . . . originated in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo or an adjoining country.’20 Furthermore, if conflict minerals

are present in the supply chain, corporations are required to follow up with 
a report about their efforts to eliminate such products from the supply 
chain. The SEC explains that an independent private sector auditor must 
also confirm reports of being ‘DRC Conflict Free’. This Congressional 
action provides a rare government mandate for corporate social responsi-
bility. To date, such involvement is uncommon but serves as a precedent for 
future CSR regulations.
The European Union’s Voluntary ‘Responsible Importer’ Label
The European Union also established a program to address the conflict 
mineral problem. However, its impact appears weaker. Rather than estab-
lishing a legal liability for corporations to comply, it is a voluntary, self-­
reporting system. Instead of a comprehensive evaluation of the supply 
chain and corresponding report that the Dodd–Frank Act requires, the 
EU guideline sets up a ‘responsible importer’ label. As long as metals and 
minerals enter the EU through a ‘responsible importer’, they are regarded 
as conflict-­free. This simplifies verification. Instead of checkpoints at 
each link of the mineral supply chain, the EU guideline reduces tracking 
to only one point – importation.21 In practice, this approach essentially 
absolves corporations in the European Union of their responsibility to 
trace mineral sourcing, leaving the onus and cost of tracking on importers.
The EU’s model is much weaker compared to the Dodd–Frank Act. 
Not all companies comply with voluntary guidelines because of the costs. 
Conflict-­free certified minerals have a higher price. This premium for 
ethical sourcing arises from both the greater demand for them and the 
limited supply of them. Smaller companies are at a disadvantage in imple-
menting ethical supply chain guidelines. They might not be able to afford 
these higher costs or have the administrative resources to implement new 
requirements.22 Instead of enacting definitive requirements, the EU only 
recommends a voluntary labeling scheme. Considering the abundance of 
pre-­existing certification systems, this effort is redundant and ineffective, 
only adding to the lack of solidarity in managing conflict minerals.

Ethical Sourcing Guidelines from China’s Chamber of Commerce
Concerns about conflict minerals in China come from the Chamber of 
Commerce of Minerals, Metals and Chemical Importers and Exporters 
(CCCMC).23 This governmental department offers voluntary guidelines 
for CSR strategies regarding processing operations and overseas mines. 
There is no sanction for non-­compliance. Instead, CCCMC hopes to 
encourage guideline adoption by rewarding the best-­performing Chinese 
companies. CCCMC’s recommendations are based on the ten principles 
of the UN Global Compact and the International Organization for 
Standardization’s (ISO) publication on social responsibility.24 CCCMC 
calls on ‘ethical and transparent behavior to effectively manage the social 
and environmental impact from mineral exploration, extraction, pro-
cessing, investment cooperation and related activities.’25 Specifically, the 
guiding principles are:
(1)	 Ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
(2)	 Adhere to ethical business practices.
(3)	 Respect human rights and protect the rights and interests of 
employees.
(4)	 Respect nature and protect the environment.
(5)	 Respect stakeholders.
(6)	 Strengthening responsibility throughout the value chain.26
This report also has specific approaches and actions that are means to 
fulfilling these high-­level ends. For example, such actions include setting 
‘targets for responsible procurement and formulat[ing] relevant company 
policies’ and ensuring ‘non complicity in human rights violations.’27 The 
principles are the categorical ends to achieve. The CCCMC elaborates on 
these principles by explaining actions and methods to reach these ends.

­minerals. Instead, it reflects decisions from the United States and the 
European Union. In fact, China’s initiatives are for its own economic 
interests, not concern for the people of the DRC. China owns a significant 
portion of mineral smelters and has connections to other international 
mines.28 China is a link in the overall supply chain for consumer electronics. 
Because the United States and European Union have set up stricter guide-
lines regarding conflict mineral transparency, Chinese operations must 
also follow suit in order to maintain their business. China’s own economic 
interests are tied to the conflict in the DRC, which explains the motive 
behind Beijing’s efforts.
A response from China shows the growing commitment to ending 
conflict minerals. It is also demonstrates the business consequences of 
ignoring this problem. There are far-­reaching implications of the violence 
occurring in Congo. Corporate responsibility is important for a stake-
holder’s own financial interests. Policies against conflict minerals protect 
China’s own economic security while helping to resolve the ensuing con-
flict. This demonstrates the dual bottom-­line that is found in CSR activity 
of the globalized economy.
EICC AND ICGLR CERTIFICATION SYSTEMS
The European Union manages imports of conflict minerals through a 
voluntary certification scheme. This policy merely echoes the attempts of 
many other organizations. This section explains the certification systems 
recommended by the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) 
and ICGLR, as well as their scopes of application.
The Electronics Industry Citizenship Coalition and the Global 
e-­Sustainability Initiative (GeSI) founded the Conflict-­Free Sourcing 
Initiative (CFSI) in 2008. This program is the most utilized resource for 
managing conflict minerals in corporate supply chains. Over 150 com­
panies across seven industries have pledged to follow EICC’s Conflict-­Free 
Sourcing Program.29 Overall, CFSI is comprised of several different pro-
grams: the Conflict-­Free Smelter Program (CFSP), the Conflict Minerals 
Reporting Template (CMRT), due diligence guidance, and stakeholder 
engagement. The Conflict-­Free Smelter Program is its most significant 
initiative. It uses third-­party audits to identify smelters and refiners

determined conflict-­free.30 Audit parameters include government-­issued 
certifications of origin, government authorization of extraction activities, 
shipping documentation and receipts of sales volume and inventories. 
These checkpoints audit the legality of mineral sourcing. The details of 
the audit procedures and protocols for each mineral are easily accessible 
on CFSI’s website.31 Smelters and refiners are cleared based on these 
thorough expectations. This published list of compliant organizations is 
instrumental for companies looking for a simple way to check the links of 
their supply chain.
Another aid to transparency is the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template, 
a tool for corporate self-­reporting. Users can download the template from 
CFSI’s website as an Excel spreadsheet. Its questions guide a declaration 
process to determine the presence of conflict minerals within the supply 
chain. Finally, the emphasis on stakeholder engagement enhances col-
laboration on this issue. Workshops and discussions spread information 
about industry best practices and upcoming issues in the supply chain. In 
summary, the Conflict-­Free Sourcing Initiative facilitates the efforts of 
corporations trying to operate in the modern business environment.
The International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) was 
previously discussed in the context of intergovernmental organizations. It 
also developed a certification mechanism. ICGLR intends for its regional 
certificates to be ‘the sole acceptable document for intra-­regional mineral 
shipments.’32 This would simplify and consolidate all other efforts to label 
minerals. ICGLR explains that the abundance of initiatives to address 
conflict minerals is overwhelming and thus collectively confusing. Other 
labeling schemes vary in scope, covered minerals and approach. Instead 
of disregarding previous frameworks, ICGLR guidelines are fully com-
patible with them. Specifically, these are the German Federal Institute for 
Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR) certification system for arti-
sanal mine sites, the Certified Trading Chains from the Office of Geology 
and Mines of Rwanda and BGR, the Tin Supply Chain Initiative from 
the International Tin Research Institute, and the OECD’s (Organisation

for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-­Affected and 
High-­Risk Areas. From these evaluations, ICGLR proposed its Regional 
Certification guidelines to guarantee that minerals ‘were mined under 
acceptable conditions, in areas free of conflict, and have exited their coun-
tries of origin in a legal fashion with all dues and taxes paid.’33 This end is 
supported by five guiding principles:
(1)	 Transparency
(2)	 Burden of proof falls primarily on exporters, secondly on governments
(3)	 Mandatory third-­party audits
(4)	 Adapt current systems
(5)	 Design for adaptability34
ICGLR identifies these as key characteristics of a viable system to track 
conflict minerals. The ICGLR system aims to be comprehensive and com-
plete, covering all the concerns related to conflict minerals and challenges 
in certification.
SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS: COMPANY OVERVIEW
The preceding discussion explained the conflict mineral crisis and general 
attempts for management. An overview of Samsung’s operations, market 
position and strategy provides context for understanding how it manages 
conflict minerals in its supply chain. Samsung Electronics, based in South 
Korea, is a leader in the global consumer electronics industry. As of 
2014, its market value is US$186.47 billion.35 About 227,000 employees 
make up its operations in 75 countries,36 manufacturing and selling a 
diverse basket of goods. Its product line includes consumer electronics, 
mobile communications and information technology, and device solutions 
(i.e., LED screens and memory cards).37 Furthermore, Samsung performs

well as a global leader in its industry. In 2013, revenues increased by 13.7 
per cent and operating profits by 27 per cent.38 This type of growth for a 
well-­established market player is a commendable feat. Booz & Co. ranked 
Samsung as the third most innovative company in the world for 2013, 
behind Apple and Google.39 This marks significant progress since its ninth-­
place standing in 2010. These metrics and rankings confirm the success of 
Samsung’s overall business strategy.
A corporate business strategy guides long-­term market decisions and 
initiatives. It establishes what a corporation ultimately wants to be known 
for. Samsung defined its ‘Vision 2020’ in 2009, branding its goals to ‘inspire 
the world, create the future.’40 Its corporate literature further explains its 
mission ‘to inspire the world with [its] innovative technologies, products, 
and design that enrich people’s lives and contribute to social prosperity by 
creating a new future.’41 This is the guiding doctrine of Samsung’s business 
decisions.
The Key to CSR Strategy Definition
This section discusses the general approach modern firms can take in 
forming a CSR strategy as a component of its business strategy. The first 
step is to establish an honest and authentic intention to achieve positive 
social or environmental good. Today’s CSR strategy maintains the spirit 
of the dual bottom line, creating a positive impact in conjunction with 
business success. CSR strategy is approached as a business strategy that 
contributes to the ‘core business objectives and core competencies of 
the firm.’42 The overarching goal of producing social and environmental 
good can be intimidating. Firms must be wary of avoiding ‘a random 
collection of unfocused, unlinked, and unrelated strategies’43 in pursuit 
of an overly broad end goal of social and environmental change. This 
explains the importance of how CSR strategy should integrate with the

­contribution to improved business performance.
Samsung’s CSR Strategy for Global Harmony
Samsung’s CSR strategy is the guiding principle driving its initiatives 
and activities relating to the public good. Samsung has produced sus-
tainability publications since 2000. The scope and success of Samsung’s 
CSR strategy has since been substantiated as business literature and 
discourse on CSR has increased. Samsung’s announced CSR vision is 
‘global harmony with people, society, and environment,’44 hoping to 
reorganize society where these components coexist in concord. Samsung 
regards people as employees, shareholders, investors, and labor and 
human rights organizations. In society, key stakeholders are business 
partners, governments and local communities. Next, Samsung consid-
ers customers, NGO, and international organizations in its environment 
category. Initiatives to fulfill its CSR vision are social contributions, 
partner collaboration, integrity management, competitive products and 
services and green management. As a large transnational corporation, 
Samsung has a variety of programs to fulfill its overarching CSR vision. 
In 2013, its investments across its CSR programs totaled around US$500 
million (536.3 billion KRW).45 Samsung’s CSR reports encompass a 
wide scope of issues: human resources, health and safety, eco-­products, 
water management, shared growth, suppliers’ compliance, conflict min-
erals, product accessibility and global social contribution. This study of 
human rights considerations in the supply chain specifically focuses on 
Samsung’s efforts for safe worker conditions and ethical mineral supplier 
standards.
A Vision in Response to Various Drivers
There are several factors driving Samsung’s CSR activities. First, there 
is internal motivation from Samsung itself. Internal reasons are the 
actor’s own choice, not in response to an outside influence or mandate. 
One important motive for developing a CSR strategy is for the business 
advantage. Higher profits are correlated with successful corporate social

­responsibility programs.46 Therefore, economic gains are an extrinsic 
reason. On the other hand, the intrinsic reason for corporate social 
responsibility stems from moral obligations. This is the viewpoint that 
corporations are inherently bound by moral expectations.47 It associates 
corporations with a higher degree of altruism than typically acknow­
ledged. Interpreting CSR from this perspective treats the corporate entity 
as a global citizen with ethical expectations and limitations. It is difficult 
to quantify the contribution of intrinsic versus extrinsic factors driving 
Samsung’s CSR behavior. Nevertheless, these possible explanations show 
that CSR can be a self-­motivated initiative.
In addition to internal motivations, expectations for CSR also come 
from external market and government pressures. In a connected, glo-
balized world, international trade makes the market more competitive, 
providing consumers with more buying power. Pressure from consumer 
groups about human rights atrocities in Africa drives corporations to 
react because of the threat of losing market share. Consumers create 
pressure for corporate responsibility. They can choose not to buy from a 
company, which eventually leads to lower profits and poorer stock per-
formance. In comparison, government regulations can force compliance 
with more immediate consequences. Governments are interfering in the 
consumer electronics market because of a responsibility to international 
human rights. Direct intervention by means of sending forces to the DRC 
is a costly alternative to address this problem. Instead, they are trying to 
reduce the demand for conflict minerals through disclosure requirements 
on the market side. Weighting the strength of each of these forces is a 
separate research endeavor. However, all of these influences are drivers for 
Samsung’s corporate responsibility initiatives.
Samsung’s CSR Activities
Samsung’s sustainability report summarizes its annual accomplishments 
regarding corporate social responsibility. There are at least two possible 
forms of human rights abuses in a consumer electronics supply chain –
worker conditions and conflict minerals. Samsung’s efforts in relation to 
worker conditions are aimed at improving the safety of mines, process-
ing locations, and factories. These are typical concerns that any type of

­corporation needs to act proactively against. Regarding the electronics 
industry specifically, companies must additionally consider the local politi-
cal situation in the DRC. As previously discussed, profits from conflict 
minerals fuel the extended warfare in the DRC. In this section, describ-
ing Samsung’s corporate social responsibility strategy and operations 
allows for later evaluation of its approach and success. Information about 
Samsung’s activities is summarized from publications and statements 
easily accessible on its official website.48
Samsung’s Advances in Worker Conditions
In the CEO message of its 2014 Sustainability Report, Samsung declared 
that its top priority is ‘to ensure the health and safety of [its] employees 
and the communities where [it] operates.’49 Regarding the consumer elec-
tronics supply chain, Samsung is concerned about the safety conditions of 
the mines, any use of child labor and employee wages. It emphasizes these 
principles in its supplier code of conduct. That is, it ‘requires all suppliers 
to provide safe and healthy working conditions for all employees.’50 This 
includes a zero-­tolerance policy for child labor and mandatory age identifi-
cation checks on new hires. Samsung expects its suppliers to abide by local 
laws and regulations to define the limitations of minors’ employment. This 
code of conduct also mandates that suppliers compensate workers at least 
minimum wage plus overtime hours, social insurance and rest days.
In 2013, third-­party audits found inadequate safety precautions regard-
ing minors working at supplier sites. They also found that 39 suppliers had 
failed to provide overtime pay. In response, Samsung directed violators 
to correct their policies and set up preventative policies against future 
infringements.51 These considerations in workplace safety, environment 
and labor rights are typical to most supply chains of transnational corpo-
rations. In the electronics supply chain specifically, there are violent atroci-
ties associated with gold, tantalum, tungsten and tin mining. This is the 
other concern in human rights management.

Samsung on Conflict-­free Mineral Sourcing
Samsung reacted quickly to the growing outcry against conflict minerals. 
Compared to the most recent 2014 report, the firm’s 2013 Sustainability 
Report had sparse literature on conflict minerals. The 2013 version briefly 
mentioned eliminating conflict minerals in its high-­level list of major issues 
from customers. The only additional information on conflict minerals was 
a short paragraph explaining its participation in the EICC’s programs to 
develop investigation methods and certification programs of smelting fac-
tories. In the 2014 Sustainability Report, Samsung’s discussion and expla-
nation of its actions against conflict minerals strengthened significantly.
In 2014, Samsung wrote more substantially about its involvement with 
the Conflict-­Free Sourcing Initiative. In light of Dodd–Frank Section 
1502, Samsung set a basic policy of ‘providing consumers with products 
that go through a legitimate and ethical distribution process.’52 It pursues 
this principle through five key actions. The first is raising supplier aware-
ness. To guarantee that final products are conflict free, Samsung needs to 
evaluate smelters and mines that its suppliers buy from. Some 3,000 of 
its global suppliers pledged to abide by its conflict-­free policy. Second, 
Samsung conducts audits on the use of conflict minerals in its supply 
chain. Unfortunately, in 2014, 601 smelters were found to be sourcing 
from conflict mines. In response, Samsung reiterated its commitment 
for materials suppliers to source from certified conflict-­free smelters. As 
of April 2014, only 3 per cent of suppliers used tantalum in their prod-
ucts sold to Samsung.53 As a member company of the EICC, Samsung’s 
actions against conflict minerals also involve collaboration with other 
governments, industry actors and non-­profit organizations. In conclusion, 
Samsung’s efforts against conflict minerals are multi-­channeled, requiring 
audits and transparency while partnering with other stakeholders.
CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF SAMSUNG’S CSR VISION 
AND MANAGEMENT OF CONFLICT MINERALS
At this point, the phenomenon and actors involved in conflict minerals and 
the consumer electronics supply chain should be clear. This chapter started

this region has far-­reaching effects on various stakeholders committed to 
human rights. They have each made efforts to address this problem. These 
efforts include voluntary certification schemes and mandatory govern-
ment statutes. The previous section explained Samsung’s reported business 
strategy, overall corporate social responsibility vision and specific activities 
to protect human rights in its supply chain. The following section seeks to 
critically evaluate Samsung’s supply chain management in relation to its 
corporate obligation to protect human rights and compare its efforts to 
three other transnational consumer electronics corporations.
Merits and Areas for Growth
Samsung’s awareness and activities in conflict mineral management match 
industry expectations. Its publications explain the violent crisis in the 
DRC and surrounding countries and then further connect it to the impact 
on its supply chain. The language is reminiscent of the themes estab-
lished by principles from the EICC, ICGLR and Chinese Chamber of 
Commerce. These touch on third-­party audits, adherence to local laws, 
human rights interests of workers, environmental protection and report-
ing. As a member of the EICC, Samsung’s stance on supplier sourcing 
aligns with the Conflict-­Free Sourcing Initiative program. This means 
buying only from certified smelters. Samsung Electronics is not covered in 
the scope of the Dodd–Frank Act directly,54 but the legislation applies to 
Samsung’s corporate partners. Therefore, Samsung also abides by Section 
1502’s disclosure requirements. In each aspect of CSR strategy and prac-
tices, Samsung merely meets expectations. They are a leader in consumer 
­electronics but fail to transform the conversation on CSR.
Regarding reporting, Samsung is transparent about its findings. It estab-
lished its ideal state but remains realistic in the gradual change towards 
it. Third-­party audits for compliance found that the reality of Samsung’s 
CSR efforts falls short of its goals. This is reasonably expected due to 
implementation lag times. Nevertheless, Samsung includes these findings 
in its annual sustainability report along with reactions to account for them. 
By being honest about shortcomings, Samsung signals its authenticity and 
genuine intentions. Therefore it continues to build consumer trust.

Comparative Industry Analysis
The quality of Samsung’s management of human rights can be judged by 
comparing it to LG Electronics, Apple and Intel. Comparing a corpora-
tion with its competitors gauges if a company is fulfilling its potential 
and keeping up with industry standards. This is a general practice to track 
business performance metrics such as revenue growth and market share. 
Specifically, comparative analyses are useful in evaluating corporate social 
responsibility initiatives because CSR is predominantly self-­motivated. 
That is, within an industry, corporations pursue CSR because of internal 
motivations rather than in response to legal regulations. Intel and Apple 
have better defined human rights management practices than Samsung. 
In relation to LG Electronics, Samsung falls about on par as a mid-­tier 
performer.
These competitors have policies in their CSR literature to uphold labor 
and human rights. Apple, for example, emphasizes education to empower 
workers, bans 60-­hour workweeks at supplier sites and runs the Apple 
Supplier EHS (environment, health, and safety) Academy to improve 
workplace safety and health standards in its supply chain.55 LG Electronics 
writes about its stance prohibiting child labor and surveys of supplier 
violations. It also performs supplier audits ‘to identify unsafe conditions 
and practices and to support suppliers’ improvement efforts.’56 Finally, 
Intel’s efforts regarding human rights are based on the UN’s ‘Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights.’ By manufacturing products 
in its own factories, it can enforce its Code of Conduct and human rights 
expectations. Regarding external suppliers, it collaborates with actors to 
implement ‘system-­level improvements on issues such as working hours.’57 
In general, firms in the electronics industry are aware of concerns about 
worker conditions, safety and supplier codes of conduct.
Specific to conflict mineral management, at a minimum, all four firms 
are associated with the Conflict-­Free Smelter Program. Adherence to 
these guidelines is the industry expectation. Beyond this, firms have

­differentiated themselves through the intensity of their mineral tracing 
programs, reporting, collaboration with governments and NGOs, and 
public relations interface. LG’s statements and policies on conflict min-
erals include joining the EICC coalition, a supplier code of conduct, 
analyzing the materials supply chain and conducting due diligence of 
smelters associated with conflict minerals.58 LG’s approach is based on a 
model of supplier consulting. It works with suppliers on their corporate 
social responsibility practices by conducting assessments and providing 
recommendations for improvement. The weakest component of LG’s 
policy is the mandate for responsible sourcing only ‘when there is an 
adequate number of CFS smelters/refiners.’59 This language creates a 
huge loophole that permits the use of conflict minerals under certain 
circumstances.
Though it is younger and smaller than Samsung, Intel emerges as an 
industry leader in human rights management. It was ‘one of the first 
companies to address the issue of conflict minerals in its supply chain,’ 
initiating supply chain surveys in 2009.60 Since then, it has focused on 
smelters and refiners as the key link to ensuring conflict-­free products. 
In January 2014, Intel reached the industry milestone of manufacturing 
the first conflict-­free microprocessor.61 Uniquely, LG’s and Intel’s CSR 
literature includes the additional consideration of unintended conse-
quences of conflict-­free labeling. They realize that the increased concern 
for due diligence ‘may unintentionally drive down demand for all min-
erals’ from the Great Lakes Region, which can ‘inadvertently hurt the 
economic opportunities for artisanal and other legitimate miners operat-
ing in that region.’62 LG Electronics encourages responsible sourcing of 
minerals from the DRC to ‘prevent an embargo and associated worsening 
of economic conditions and human suffering.’63 The concern of a ‘de 
facto embargo’ reflects local views on mining reform.64 Furthermore, 
Intel has impressive accessibility for consumer transparency, offering

documentation.
Apple also has similar policies enforcing a supplier code of conduct 
for responsible mineral sourcing. Speaking to worker health and safety, 
it hopes to ‘eradicate unethical hiring and exploitation of workers – even 
when local laws permit such practices.’66 This outperforms Samsung’s 
policy. Regarding wage and benefit expectations, Samsung’s guidelines 
are for suppliers to abide by ‘local laws and regulations.’67 At face value, 
this seems commendable because of the expectation for legal compliance. 
However it is not innovative. It does not exceed the minimum require-
ments by law. In fact, this referral to local law is operationally inefficient 
and inadequate. First, varying standards create an administrative burden 
for audits. Since guidelines are relative to the geographic location of the 
supplier, audit processes cannot be universal. There is also ambiguity when 
suppliers operate in several countries. Furthermore, by referring to local 
laws, Samsung risks falling short of ideal corporate behavior. Given the 
variance in legislation across countries, Samsung’s global suppliers are held 
to different standards. A better approach is to set the same expectations for 
all suppliers, regardless of geographic location. By merely referring to local 
regulations, Samsung’s supplier code of conduct is vulnerable to short-
comings. Given their reach and influence, TNCs could function as global 
political actors, setting standards that apply like law. Such is the new reign 
in the global market.
There are several factors to consider when explaining performance dif-
ferences. All four firms compete in the global consumer electronics indus-
try. However, they vary in revenue, years since founding and company 
headquarters. Samsung, the oldest of these firms, has a market value of 
US$186.47 billion.68 Intel (market value of US$129.22 billion)69 and Apple 
(US$483.15 billion)70 are both US companies headquartered in California. 
LG Electronics, headquartered in South Korea, has the smallest market 
value of US$10.03 billion.71 These differences are not direct indicators 
of a company’s corporate social responsibility efforts. According to the

UN Global Compact, company size has the most significant influence on 
sustainability performance because of greater financial and knowledge 
resources.72 However, it does not guarantee performance. In other words, 
a company’s monetary value can signal its potential for CSR success but 
does not explain why one competitor may perform better than another. 
LG’s subpar CSR performance might be because its market value is vastly 
smaller than the other three players. However, this correlation is inconclu-
sive. Beyond these influences, a better factor to determine a corporation’s 
CSR success is how genuine its commitment to valuable improvements is. 
Yet, this is a factor that cannot be measured directly.
Comparing Samsung’s activities to pre-­existing standards of conduct 
and other industry players’ actions, Samsung meets but does not exceed 
expectations. It voluntarily satisfies the recommendations discussed before-
hand but does not lead the field in conflict mineral management. It urges its 
suppliers to switch to certified conflict-­free smelters, as well as encourages 
all smelters to be certified. These activities are merely sufficient. The world 
looks to Samsung as an industry leader in electronics sales. Its reputation 
can challenge competitors to match its initiatives. Furthermore, Samsung 
has the financial and human capital resources to make a more substantial 
effort. Due to its size and financial success, Samsung is positioned to make 
a significant change in conflict mineral usage and human rights. First-­tier 
CSR strategies are rated as such because they have elements that exceed 
the industry norm, looking a few extra steps ahead of their competitors. 
Though Samsung keeps up with industry norms, it does not yet contribute 
innovation in the corporate social responsibility sphere.
The Impact of CSR Activity for Samsung
So far, this analysis has evaluated how Samsung approaches human rights 
concerns in the supply chain through CSR programs and conflict mineral 
management. It is also valuable to study what these initiatives mean for 
the corporations’ performance. The key theme of 21st-­century corporate 
social responsibility is to produce a social benefit in conjunction with 
improved business performance. In communicating about material issues, 
Samsung emphasizes that it wants ‘to create value through corporate 
sustainability management . . . while also strengthening its position as a 
market innovator for the future.’73 This embodies the dual bottom line of 
CSR. Corporate social responsibility adds value to the firm through public

image and risk management. These are internal benefits achieved while 
pursuing a greater good.
Externally, CSR contributes to developing a corporation’s public image 
and reputation. It becomes a part of corporate branding. CSR can achieve 
‘competitive differentiation,’ generating a unique identity associated with 
the company.74 This contributes to market performance. Efforts in CSR 
can steal market share from competitors or create an opportunity to enter 
a new market. As the Millennial generation overtakes the consumer popu-
lation, these strategies are a way to respond to demands of the new con-
sumer.75 Consumers today expect a connection that is more than a mere 
goods and payment exchange.
Managing conflict minerals in the supply chain is necessary for sustain-
able business. For the electronics industry, conflict minerals are important 
because they pose a business risk. Resolving human rights violations is 
a necessary component of Samsung’s business strategy. Ultimately, this 
CSR translates to business sustainability in two ways. First, Samsung 
protects its market share by responding to consumer pressures. Due to 
increased awareness about conflict minerals from non-­profit organiza-
tions and the Dodd–Frank Act, consumers are more conscious of mineral 
sourcing. Second, managing conflict minerals is dually important because 
it relates directly to supply chain sustainability. The circumstances in the 
DRC make the supply of crucial raw resources volatile and undepend-
able. Conflict mineral management ensures that its operations have the 
necessary ­materials to manufacture products without huge variations in 
price. Political conflict, violence and instability in the DRC make conflict 
minerals management necessary for both corporate image and supply 
chain security. Samsung’s commitment to human rights is a way to ensure 
economic ­sustainment and future progress.
Samsung, a Potential Leader
Evaluating Samsung’s performance in the consumer electronics market-
place, it is clear that, in business terms, it is an industry leader. As a leader 
in the technology market, Samsung can also shape industry expectations 
for corporate behavior. As a large company, competitors and customers 
look to Samsung for its initiatives in social responsibility. Market leaders 
play a key role in defining industry paradigms.

The ‘institutional isomorphism model as the normative factor’76 could 
redefine industry approaches to conflict minerals. This is when competition 
causes mirroring and adoption of practices throughout the whole industry. 
Powerfully, Samsung’s CSR achievements could stimulate comparable 
actions by other consumer electronics companies. Therefore, competition 
may create a form of collective governance. In trying to outperform each 
other, corporations continually raise general expectations for CSR activity. 
Specifically, because of the continual challenge to match initiatives against 
conflict minerals, the industry can slowly starve rebel groups out of their 
revenue.
CONCLUSION
Evaluating human rights considerations in a transnational supply chain 
requires multiple perspectives. Stakeholders involved are civilians, workers, 
rebel groups, governments in the DRC and surrounding area, trans­
national corporations, intergovernmental organizations, global superpow-
ers, non-­profit organizations, and individual consumers. As a global issue, 
there are many uncoordinated streams for resolution. Non-­profit and 
intergovernmental organizations offer numerous different certifications. 
Regulations from different national sovereigns vary in scope and severity. 
Each of these actors has their own agenda of priorities. Thus, this is not 
a simple issue. It is a tough balance for companies to understand their 
level of complicity, set and enforce guidelines without destroying the local 
economy in the DRC.
This was a focused case study of how an industry leader addresses 
human rights in its supply chain. It started by explaining the specific 
human rights abuses that arise from sourcing. Then, it looked at efforts 
to resolve this issue. These established expectations to evaluate Samsung’s 
efforts. Doing so explained how corporations can manage human rights 
in their business operations. They can set a CSR strategy according to 
regulations and industry practices, as well as innovating new programs and 
approaches. This case study did not intend to assign or measure levels of 
moral culpability of those involved. Instead, agreeing that actions against 
conflict minerals are necessary, this is research into what these actions can 
be.

The idea of corporate citizenship frames transnational corporations as 
entities responsible to the world. Conflict minerals are a domestic issue 
with global reach. Without the global demand for consumer electronics, 
rebel groups would not target mines as a lucrative revenue stream. The 
ultimate end is not to prohibit the use of conflict minerals. Rather, man-
aging conflict minerals is a means to the ultimate goal of ending human 
rights atrocities in the DRC. People, not profits, are the end. In a globalized 
economy, transnational corporations are prominent actors. Tied to other 
stakeholders through economic dependence and human rights obligations, 
they are increasingly influential and well-­positioned to make a global 
impact.

China’s investment traditions; the modern transnational corporation10.  China’s investment traditions and the 
modern transnational corporation
Megan Bowman, George Gilligan and 
Justin O’Brien1
INTRODUCTION
China has emerged as a prominent investment actor in the contemporary 
global economy. It is a significant recipient of foreign direct investment 
(FDI) and one of the largest outward investors in foreign jurisdictions, 
both of which have stimulated China’s importance as a global investment 
actor across markets and continents today. However, while China’s eco-
nomic prowess in terms of attracting inward FDI and expanding trade 
surplus is reasonably well understood, academic attention has been given 
to China’s role as an outward investor and its outward foreign direct 
investment (ODI) ambitions only in more recent years.2 This chapter 
contributes to the growing body of literature on the duality of Chinese 
FDI–ODI by adding an historical perspective to the state capital story and 
examining China’s trade and investment patterns through a longitudinal 
lens. Specifically, it analyzes FDI and ODI data in the context of China’s 
Five-­Year Plans, which have to date been an underutilized prism through 
which to view the patterns and ambitions of trade and investment from 
a Chinese national perspective. This chapter discusses how China has 
become a modern global investment force by documenting its historical 
record and where China’s ODI ambitions are likely to focus in the future.

Importantly, we also explore the role and implications of TNCs as modern 
vehicles for politically motivated ODI strategies.
We start by documenting the emergence of China as a global investment 
force. We trace China’s investment and trade traditions back to the 12th 
century and through succeeding centuries into the post-­war ‘globalized’ 
boom of the 1930s, then to the relative isolation under Mao Zedong in the 
1950s, the ‘open door’ FDI policy of the 1980s, and the ‘going global’ ODI 
strategy of the current era. We then explore the strategy behind China’s 
global investment behaviour. Utilizing extant empirical data we analyze 
the global sectors and jurisdictions in which China has invested and show 
that significant Chinese investments have occurred in both developed 
and developing nations but more so in the former; and in mining/natural 
resources but with emerging diversification toward energy, agriculture and 
commercial real estate. Specifically, the data demonstrate that state-­owned 
enterprises (SOEs) have been the primary modality of Chinese ODI, 
which have been highly scrutinized TNCs for their potential as politically 
motivated corporations even while pursuing commercial opportunities. 
We conclude by discussing how China’s increasing middle-­class consumer 
demand, together with declining domestic supply, will be relevant factors 
that shape China’s strategic investment priorities in the future.
CHINA’S EMERGENCE AS A GLOBAL INVESTMENT 
FORCE
China’s Traditions of Outward Trade
China has a longstanding tradition of external trade. For example, in the 
12th to 14th centuries it enjoyed economic advancement and dynamism 
far exceeding its Western counterparts.3 During this period China reput-
edly established a professional navy and vigorous international trade into 
India, Asia, Arabia and East Africa.4 By the early 15th century, however, 
trade missions had become costly for the Chinese Government and with 
the death of Emperor Zhu Zhanji 朱瞻基 in 1435 the fleets were recalled.5 
Griswold asserts that by 1477 China had begun a path towards self-­

sufficiency that comprised ‘cultural and economic inwardness, a closed 
and centralized political system, and an anti-­commercial culture’ that 
lasted for more than 400 years.6 Yu clarifies the purpose of nationalism to 
this process as ‘key to repelling foreign invasions and maintaining China’s 
full sovereignty.’7 Nonetheless, Cheung and Qian note that China still ran 
a substantial trade balance surplus during the 16th and 17th centuries,8 and 
Maddison estimates that China accounted for nearly one-­third of world 
GDP output from 1700 to 1820.9
In the early 1840s, foreign powers such as Great Britain pressured China 
to open its economy to receive international trade through a series of 
treaties that pried open ports to allow transactions with foreigners. For 
example, the 1842 Treaty of Nanking permitted foreign trade with China 
through five ports and stipulated a 5 per cent tariff on almost all goods 
leaving and entering the country.10 Nonetheless, the scale of Chinese trade 
and production was relatively small until China’s 1895 defeat in the Sino–
Japanese War, which precipitated the Treaty of Shimonoseki that permit-
ted Japanese businesses to invest directly in China and to produce goods 
and services that could be sold within China and abroad. Soon after, this 
privilege was extended to other foreign nations via most-­favored nation 
agreements, with the result that foreign capital financed China’s indus-
trialization by injecting funds into its telecommunications, railroad and 
shipping industries. By the early 20th century, 48 Chinese cities had been 
opened to foreign trade.11
As ports opened up and foreigners were allowed to invest and trade, 
China transitioned from a closed to an open economy. Cheng estimates 
that from 1900 to 1913 the total value of Chinese trade grew twice as much 
as it had during the previous 40 years and that China’s trade growth was 
faster than the world average in the first three decades of the 20th century.12

Indeed, Mitchener and Yan claim that the period 1901–1930 was 
comparable with the present period of globalization in trading terms.13 
Specifically, the exogenous shock of World War I dramatically raised the 
price of Chinese exports and increased the demand for its goods abroad. 
For example, China’s exports to the United States grew at an annual rate of 
6 per cent before World War I, but boomed after the war started, growing 
by approximately 27 per cent per year; similarly, exports to Japan grew at 
5.8 per cent per year pre-­war and then jumped to 17.4 per cent per year 
after 1913. Trade costs declined when the war ended in 1918, which, in 
turn, led to a rise in China’s terms of trade and further growth in its export 
sector, particularly in exports of unskilled, intensive manufactures, mining 
and agricultural products. Indeed, while the war disrupted trade in many 
other parts of the world, it created ‘new markets for Chinese goods that 
had previously been served by producers in belligerent countries’.14 China’s 
total trade as a share of GDP almost tripled during the period 1903–1928.15 
China would not experience this pace again for nearly 60 years.
The Long March into Isolation
On 1 October 1949 Mao Zedong 毛泽东, having led the Communists to 
victory against the Nationalists, proclaimed the founding of the People’s 
Republic of China. At this time, the worldview of the Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) was anti-­imperialism, anti-­colonialism, and focused on Sino–
Soviet relations to the exclusion of the United States.16
During the late 1940s and early 1950s, China followed the Soviet model 
of centralized economic development, emphasizing heavy industry at the 
expense of consumer goods.17 However, Mao disapproved of Khrushchev’s 
1956 de-­Stalinization policy and the principle of peaceful coexistence and 
competition with the United States.18 By the late 1950s Mao had developed 
different ideas for how China could directly advance to Socialism through 
13  Mitchener and Yan (n 11) 2–3, 6. Their data show that an exogenous shock 
to the price of traded goods can boost unskilled industries more so than skilled 
industries; and that the observed decline in the skill premium in China in the 1920s 
is consistent with China’s changing terms of trade.

the mobilization of China’s workers; ideas that precipitated China’s Great 
Leap Forward in 1958 and the contemporaneous Sino–Soviet split.19
In terms of trade and economic measures, the Great Leap Forward 
introduced human labour intensive industrialization and collectivized 
farming and was initially intended as a five-­year economic plan (see Table 
10A.1); however, it was abandoned after only two years due to economic 
breakdown following poor harvests and mass starvation.20 Six years later, 
in 1966, Mao instigated the Cultural Revolution, which continued until 
his death in 1976. During this time diplomatic and trade relations warmed 
between Beijing and Washington, culminating in a declared desire by both 
countries to normalize relations when President Richard Nixon visited 
Beijing in 1972.21
Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping 邓小平, far-­reaching economic 
reforms were instigated from 1977, which included the ‘open door’ policy 
designed to encourage foreign trade and FDI via market-­oriented meas-
ures22 (see Table 10A.1). By the late 1970s Chinese policy-­makers were 
cooperating with foreign oil companies regarding access to offshore oil 
and gas fields within China’s sovereign seas. Howson notes that this com-
mercial initiative precipitated intense internal political debate regarding 
China’s potential loss of control over strategic natural resource assets in 
a context of hidden foreign political agendas; ironically, these concerns 
would be echoed by US constituents vis-­à-­vis Chinese acquisition of US 
assets nearly 40 years later.23
Nonetheless, China continued to enter into production sharing contracts

with US oil companies such as Mobil, Chevron and Exxon in order to 
explore and access Chinese offshore oil and gas resources. The prime com-
mercial entity established by the Chinese government for these purposes 
was the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) Ltd,24 which 
is an SOE that plays a prominent role today as a Chinese ODI actor abroad.
China’s Economy Opens Up and Trade Imbalances Spur Outward 
Investment
Apart from domestic economic and law reform, a key element of China’s 
1979 ‘Reform and Opening to the Outside World’ policy emphasized 
increased trade with foreign nations and inward FDI into China. Unlike 
the earlier opening of the 19th century, this strategy was unilaterally 
­initiated by China.
Policy reform of inward FDI began with China’s creation of Special 
Economic Zones (SEZs) in 1979–1980. SEZs were introduced in the coastal 
provinces of Fujian and Guangdong; they permitted preferential treatment 
(with regard to corporate income tax and duty free imports) to foreign 
invested companies.25 Subsequently, Economic and Trade Development 
Zones (ETDZs) were created in 1985 in port cities along China’s eastern 
coastline, which granted preferential investment as well as import treat-
ment.26 The creation of SEZs and ETDZs greatly facilitated FDI to China, 
particularly in consumer electronics and computer-­related goods.27
Some commentators argue that China viewed inward FDI very stra-
tegically at this time. Howson asserts that it was seen ‘as a way to attract 
hard currency financing for China’s bankrupt state-­owned or controlled 
assets, and gain additional benefits like foreign technology, management 
know-­how, distribution and marketing skills, and foreign sales channels 
for hard currency earning exports.’28 Moreover, Yueh notes that China 
exerted significant control over the form and destination of inward FDI; 
for example, the Chinese partner often held 51 per cent of shares in joint 
24  Indeed, disaggregation of the Ministry of Petroleum resulted in the 
creation of three new major SOEs: CNOOC Ltd. (1982), China Petrochemical 
Corporation (1983) and China National Petroleum Corporation (‘CNPC’) (1988).

ventures, which were only approved if two criteria were satisfied: first, the 
foreign partner had superior technology of interest to China; second, the 
manufactured products were export-­quality and had demand in global 
markets.29 In this way, China was able to mitigate foreign takeovers while 
developing domestic technological capacity.
In the 1990s, China began to look beyond inward FDI to international 
capital markets in order to raise finance for state assets as it was ‘no longer 
content to be the workshop of the world’.30 Accordingly, in 1997–1998 
Chinese authorities initiated a ‘national team’ (guojia dui 国家队) of large 
internationally competitive Chinese enterprises that could compete with 
the large multinational companies dominating global production chains. 
These companies were selected from strategically important sectors such as 
oil and gas, iron and steel, electricity generation and telecommunications.31 
Interestingly, however, hallmarks of ODI are not notably evidenced in 
China’s Five-­Year Plans until the 9th Five-­Year Plan, which commenced 
in 1996.
The situation changed radically in the early 2000s when China initiated 
its ‘going out’ or ‘going global’ strategy.32 This strategy was launched in 
China’s 10th Five-­Year plan in 2001, the same year that China acceded to 
the World Trade Organization. At this time, three major initiatives were 
instigated which indelibly changed the role and nature of China as a global 
investment actor.
First, China started issuing shares in its major SOEs on foreign 
exchanges. For example, PetroChina (a subsidiary of CNPC) was listed on 
the New York and Hong Kong exchanges in 2000; in the following year, 
Sinopec (a subsidiary of Sinopec Corporation) and CNOOC were listed 
on the New York, Hong Kong and also London exchanges. Brødsgaard 
notes that these listings created huge capital gains for the subsidiaries and 
their parent companies such that these SOEs ‘became powerful in terms 
of their ability to generate capital and to augment their value in terms of 
market capitalization.’33

Second, the Ministry of Commerce was established as respon­
sible for domestic and international trade and international economic 
cooperation, and the Chinese State-­owned Assets Supervision and 
Administration Commission (SASAC) was created to exercise ownership 
over China’s largest SOEs and to ensure their pursuit of overall national 
interests.34
Third, President Jiang Zemin 江泽民 announced that the ‘going out’ 
policy included increased ODI, undertaking construction and engineering 
projects abroad, and exporting labor services.35 While it is difficult to cata-
logue exact policy measures due to a lack of publicly available information, 
initial measures certainly included relaxation of investment restrictions 
abroad and increasing financial support for the national team of corporate 
champions.36
The effect of China’s going out policy was almost immediate: China’s 
ODI stock reached approximately US$36 billion and ranked sixth among 
118 emerging economies by late 2002.37 In 2004 a gradual liberalization 
of the ODI regulatory regime began with the ‘reform of the investment 
system’.38 This process comprised multiple prongs, including decentrali-
zation of investment verification and approval at the provincial level, 
relaxation of foreign exchange controls and stimulus packages to ease the 
transition of Chinese companies onto the world stage.39
Importantly, the going global strategy motivated Chinese SOEs to 
actively seek to acquire foreign assets and equity interests, as opposed 
to merely trading in global commodities and raw materials.40 This global 
acquisition strategy continues today, with high-­profile examples includ-
ing CNOOC’s successful acquisition of Nexen in Canada (2012) and the

the world’s 50 largest telecoms operators.41
Importantly, China has never been in arrears on foreign debt. Its foreign 
borrowing is relatively modest and predominantly medium-­to-­long term.42 
Moreover, China’s foreign reserves are significant. In 2007 China had 
accumulated huge foreign exchange reserves of $1.2 trillion,43 which nearly 
tripled to $3.1 trillion in 2012 or 45 per cent of its annual GDP.44 As a 
result, China has been able to become a significant foreign investor and 
also world banker. For example, as of 30 June 2013, China held nearly 
$1.5 trillion of US long-­term debt, representing the largest single foreign 
country holding of same.45

SECURING SUPPLY

Despite the fact that China is a relatively new outward investor, it now

ence has grown in almost every market in recent years.’46 Accordingly,

China’s ­importance as an investment actor across markets and continents. 
Interestingly, the recent rapid growth in Chinese ODI flows has come 
from a small base. UNCTAD data show that China’s ODI stock in 2008 
was $183 billion – 1.11 per cent of world stock and placing China 19th 
in global rankings;. However it has increased year-­on-­year to reach $509 
billion in 2012,47 which equated to 2.16 per cent of total world stock, 
placing China 13th in global rankings.48 Thus, while China’s ODI stock has 
been quite small relative to other nations, it is clearly growing.
Moreover, Chinese investment activity has clearly changed over time. 
Prior to 2005, China’s ODI share of the manufacturing sector fell from 
60 per cent in 1993–1995 to less than 15 per cent in 2005.49 During the 
same period, resources exploration grew from approximately 5 per cent of 
Chinese ODI stock in 1993–1995 to 15 per cent in 2005.50 From 2005 to 
2012, energy, power and metals together accounted for over 70 per cent of 
Chinese ODI, and real estate, construction and agriculture have become 
areas of growing interest.51
In terms of target jurisdictions, there are several recipients of large 
amounts of Chinese investment. Data from both the Chinese Ministry 
of Commerce (MOFCOM) and the US Heritage Foundation show that 
Australia and the United States have been leading recipients of Chinese 
investment, and engineering and construction contracts ­(200­5­–­2012), 
with other major recipients being Canada, Brazil and Indonesia 
(see Table 10.1).52

Moreover, the geographic distribution of Chinese ODI has changed over 
time. Cheung and Qian demonstrate that Asia’s share increased to nearly 
half of total Chinese ODI in 2005, up from 16 per cent in 1991.53 During 
the same period, Australia, the United States and Canada accounted for 
a decreasing aggregate share of Chinese ODI stock, which fell to less 
than 10 per cent in 2005 from over 40 per cent in 1991.54 Derek Scissors 
of the Heritage Foundation notes that ‘Chinese enterprises have shown 
a clear tendency to move in packs’ regarding geographic distribution of 
ODI.55
Strategic Investment Priorities for China
The preceding data demonstrate that Chinese ODI has been substantially 
directed into energy, power and metals in the past decade and that certain 
jurisdictions are favoured investment destinations. These empirics reflect 
Chinese policy.
In the 11th Five-­Year plan (2006–2010), China’s energy policy approach 
focused on developing domestic supply as the primary means of meeting 
its energy demands, supplemented by foreign energy sources. Pursuant to

China’s Policy on Mineral Resources (2003)56 and Policies for Development 
of Iron and Steel Industry (2005),57 government support has been given to 
Chinese investments in foreign mining assets58 in the form of preferential 
loans granted to SOEs through the China Development Bank and China 
Exim Bank.59 The result has been twofold. First, there was a surge in global 
resources investments by China during this policy timeframe with China’s 
ODI stock in the mining sector (oil, gas and minerals) rising starkly from 
$5.94 billion in 2004 to $44.66 billion in 2010.60 Second, the prominent

58  China’s ‘Policy on Mineral Resources’ focuses on domestic utilization of 
minerals within China as well as the opening up of Chinese minerals resources to 
foreigners. Nonetheless, Item IV of that Policy provides that: ‘The Chinese govern-
ment encourages domestic enterprises to take part in international cooperation in 
the sphere of mineral resources, and in exploration, exploitation and utilization 
of foreign mineral resources. It will promote and protect investments in mineral 
resources prospecting and exploitation outside China’. Art. 30 of the ‘Policies for 
Development of Iron and Steel Industry’ states that: ‘We should, according to 
the principles of making their advantages complement each other and achieving 
the win–win situation, intensify the international cooperation regarding overseas 
mineral resources. We should support those large backbone enterprise groups 
to establish overseas production and supplying bases of iron mines, chrome ore 
mines, manganese mines, nickel ore mines, waste steel and coking coal, etc. by 
way of setting up solely-­funded enterprises, joint-­equity enterprises, contractual 
enterprises and purchase of mineral resources . . . Where two or more domestic 
enterprises are engaged in vicious competition for overseas resources, the state 
may adopt administrative coordination to hold alliance or select one of them to 
make investment so as to avoid vicious competition. The relevant enterprises shall 
be subject to the administrative coordination of the state’.

modality of Chinese foreign investment has been SOEs, which accounted 
for approximately 70 per cent of China’s ODI stock in 2009.61
Indeed, the central role of SOEs in the rise of China’s ODI continued 
to flourish under the 12th Five-­Year plan (2011–2015) which built on the 
‘going out’ strategy by stipulating that China gradually increase the level 
of international operations of its multi-­jurisdictional corporations and 
financial institutions, particularly in the agricultural and construction 
sectors. The data detailed above for Chinese ODI in the global agriculture, 
real estate and construction sectors reflect this policy emphasis. The 13th 
Five-­Year plan (2016–2020) reflects China’s economic rise to become the 
world’s second largest economy with per capita GDP increasing to $7,800. 
The core goal of the latest plan is to enhance national governance through 
modernization; this will likely include a shift to increased ODI by privately 
owned enterprises.62
These trends are likely to continue according to international predic-
tions. For example, the OECD–FAO Agricultural Outlook 2013–2022 
report focused on China in the context of projected production, con-
sumption, stocks, trade and prices for agricultural products for the 
period 2013 to 2022.63 The OECD–FAO Report sets out key data and 
analysis in Chapter 2 titled ‘Feeding China: Prospects and challenges in 
the next decade’.64 A clear message is the increasing symbiosis between 
global markets and China’s appetite and output. The OECD predicts that 
although China should remain self-­sufficient in the main food crops (such 
as rice and sugar), overall agricultural output growth from China will slow 
in the next decade even as Chinese demand rises due to a rapidly growing 
and urbanizing population.65

Part of the issue is that China now lacks the rural workforce needed for 
more complex large-­scale farming operations; its rural sectors have been 
drained of modern, skilled agricultural workers due to land tenure policies 
and higher urban wages.66 Moreover, there are serious constraints to any 
further expansion of agricultural production. Increased urbanisation will 
likely limit the usage of arable land, and the quality of extant cultivated 
land is deteriorating.67 The OECD Report concludes that the net result 
will be limited productivity within the decade, which will necessarily curb 
supply from China.68
Concomitantly, however, the rapid increase in China’s urban popula-
tion will continue to affect global food demand patterns. The OECD 
projects a total population explosion to 1.392 billion by 2022, comprising 
a potential significant urban population increase.69 And urbanization has 
significant ramifications for food demand and global markets. Urban 
zones are associated with higher incomes and larger food consumption 
rates, including meat, dairy and fish. Indeed, while China is expected to 
remain the largest fish exporter and maintain its aquaculture leadership at 
63 per cent of global production, it is also predicted to become the world’s 
leading consumer of pig meat per capita, surpassing the European Union 
by 2022.70
The result of reduced domestic supply and increased domestic demand 
is just simple economics: China’s policy choices will need to address 
domestic resource constraints, which necessarily entails higher foreign 
imports. China may well import more meat in order to contain environ-
mental problems associated with livestock production and to limit the 
growth in feed requirements while lowering competition for land associ-
ated with high intensity crop production by importing more coarse grain 
to meet rising demand.71 Such a policy choice would expedite China’s 
transition from an export-­driven economy to a consumer-­based one in the 
next 10–30 years, an aspiration confirmed by China’s Prime Minister Li 
Keqiang 李克强 during the 2013 Fortune Global Forum.72

The opening of ‘soft resources’ commodities markets in China represent 
timely new opportunities for Western meat, dairy and grain producers. 
A prime example was the 2013 merger agreement between Smithfield 
Foods, Inc. (Smithfield) and Shuanghui International Holdings Limited 
(Shuanghui). US-­based Smithfield is the world’s largest pork processor 
and hog producer, and one of the biggest and oldest pork producers in the 
United States. Hong Kong-­based Shuanghui is the majority shareholder 
of China’s largest meat processor, Henan Shuanghui Investment and 
Development, which is publicly listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. 
The total proposed deal was valued at $7.1 billion, pursuant to which 
Shuanghui agreed to pay $34 per share and assume Smithfield’s debt. The 
US Committee on Foreign Investment (CFIUS) reviewed the proposal for 
potential national security concerns about, among other things, whether 
the takeover places Shuanghui in a position to disrupt food supply in the 
United States before approving the takeover on 6 September 2013.73 It 
represented the largest Chinese takeover of an American company in US 
history.
It is yet to be seen to what extent the US decision will influence foreign 
policy in other recipient jurisdictions. The OECD–FAO Report is cer-
tainly optimistic, predicting that soft commodities markets will become 
­increasingly open and integrated within the decade.74
Supply Priorities in China’s Global Investment Strategy
Arguably, the focus on sectoral investment in resources (particularly in 
metals and mining) with diversification into energy (particularly gas) and 
food production indicates China’s national interest in supporting a rapidly 
urbanizing population that exceeds per capita indigenous resources. In this 
regard, some commentators argue that China has a coordinated state strat-
egy beyond simply seeking higher financial return, given that China is a

Sino–Australian investment provides a useful case-­study for examining 
China’s investment strategy. Natural resources and mining sector invest-
ments have traditionally dominated the Australia–China FDI landscape. 
Regarding Chinese strategic investment in Australia, 78 per cent of com-
pleted Chinese investments from January 2005 to December 2012 were 
for the purpose of securing supply to an underlying commodity; and the 
largest recipient (73 per cent of all Chinese investment) was the mining 
sector.77 Overall, Chinese FDI in Australia increased significantly year-­
on-­year from 2006 to 2012 (Table 10.2) partly due to resurging energy and 
metals investments.78
In 2012 alone, however, total Chinese investment into Australia con-
sisted of 48 per cent into mining and 42 per cent into gas, which reflected 
an increased global demand for LNG in conjunction with China’s plan 
to diversify its energy consumption structure beyond coal.79 Importantly,

solely in the energy (gas and oil) sector and was Australia’s third-­largest

2005 to December 2012.80
The SOE Conundrum
Despite the national benefits that can accrue to investee nations from 
increased FDI, the intrinsic nature of an SOE has tended to cause media 
and policy concerns in recipient nations.81 This is because an assumed 
investment priority of SOEs is political purchase rather than commercial 
strategy. This was seen clearly at the time of Chinese acquisitions (attempted 
and actual) during 2004–2005, including CNOOC’s failed bid for Unocal 
(2005), which raised ‘fierce political opposition’ in the United States82 and 
resulted in US–China political tensions.83 Concerns also manifested in 
Australian media and policy debates. For example, headlines in Australia in 
2012–2013 included ‘China’s state-­owned enterprises obtain FIRB approval 
by stealth’;84 and the former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott com-
mented that there should be no ‘colour bar’ on investors, which was an 
implicit reference to local concerns over Chinese FDI into Australia.85
Why is there such concern? Some understanding of SOEs is relevant 
at this point. Oi describes the evolution of the Chinese ‘corporate state’ 
from the initial local town and village enterprises (TVE) to show that 
Chinese SOEs were traditionally an organizational form, not a legal one.86

Specifically, Oi describes the county as similar to ‘a large multi-­level 
­corporation . . . at the top of a corporate hierarchy as the corporate head-
quarters, the township as the regional headquarters, and the villages as 
companies within the larger corporation’.87 Importantly, TVEs were forms 
of government not private ownership. Traditionally, therefore, an SOE did 
not have separate legal personality nor issue stock or equity (‘ownership’) 
in itself; instead it was administratively controlled by the state, which had 
the right to appoint management and appropriate revenues or profits.
Since the commencement of the Chinese corporatization program, 
as expressed in the 1994 Company Law and 2006 PRC Company Law, 
Chinese companies can take the form of a company limited by shares, 
limited by liability or wholly owned by a state agency. However, corporat­
ization is still not synonymous with privatization,88 and an SOE is now 
administratively and financially controlled by an entity of the state (central 
or local). Indeed, in 2012 top executives at 53 of the most important central 
SOEs held ministerial-­level status and equal rank to provincial governors.89 
By implication, a controlling shareholder of a Chinese SOE has political 
as well as economic dominance, which has important implications for the 
nature of a state-­controlled corporation and who it seeks to serve.
For these reasons, uneasiness around SOEs has not been confined 
to foreign investee nations; the Chinese middle class is also concerned 
about domestic favouritism toward SOEs to the detriment of private 
entrepreneurship.90 For example, some Chinese scholars argue that Deng 
Xiaoping’s plan for the country’s development has been reversed by SOE 
dominance if the main beneficiaries of SOE growth are corrupt officials 
and not the Chinese public.91 Cheng Li further notes that bank loans and 
preferential policies have been almost exclusively available to SOEs.92
Thus, a challenge for commentators of state capital is to discern and 
appreciate the impacts of three factors when ascribing political and/or 
nefarious motives to SOEs that facilitate ODI in foreign jurisdictions.

China’s investment traditions; the modern transnational corporation    ­303
First, China’s increasing need to secure supply for its domestic demand 
is no secret: it requires resources, technology and national champions to 
go out and expand overseas. Scissors writes that: ‘The foundations for 
Chinese outward investment are neither subtle nor, except for advanced 
dual-­use technology, dangerous.’93
Second, tensions may exist between the goals of central and provincial 
government entities. The above depiction of local (not central) government 
actors as germane to the commercial success of traditional TVEs/SOEs 
are telling.94 Indeed, Oi terms China’s state-­led growth as local state corpo-
ratism whereby local governments in China are economic and not merely 
administrative actors with the result that ‘the entrepreneurial interests of 
local governments have compromised their role as agents of the central 
state’.95 Accordingly, the fragmentation of SOE ownership and thus poten-
tially competing priorities between levels of government add complexity to 
SOE investment behaviour.
Third, SOEs may be exercising independence from the government 
­entities that formally own or control them. In March 2012, SASAC 
issued regulations requiring central state-­controlled SOEs to: register 
with SASAC before undertaking ‘key investment projects’ in their core 
­businesses; obtain SASAC approval prior to investing overseas in non-­core 
areas of business; and lodge details with SASAC of sources of investment 
and financing for proposed non-­core area investments.96

and Modern Law (Harvard UP, 2013).

No. 28 was issued on 18 March 2012 and came into force on 1 May 2012. It builds 
on extant SASAC regulations: State-­owned Assets Supervision and Administration 
Commission, Interim Measures on the Supervision And Administration of Overseas 
State-­Owned Assets of Central SOEs, Circular No. 26 (14 June 14 2011) and ‘State-­
owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission’, Circular No. 27 (14 
June 2011). These measures regulate: foreign investments by central SOEs  from 
their initial decision-­making  through project management and operation, as well 
as the way in which equity interests in foreign investment projects are managed and 
monitored by central SOEs and SASAC. For details, see Wei Chen and Jiahao Xie,

Yet despite the SASAC framework, there is some evidence to suggest that 
the Going Out strategy is being led by Chinese firms rather than central 
government. Brødsgaard suggests that Chinese companies listed abroad 
operate under international (not domestic) market conditions and that pow-
erful SOEs have blocked state initiatives that may be contrary to their own 
economic interests, preferring instead to garner ‘legitimacy by symbolizing 
China’s economic rise’.97 Howson makes a similar claim, citing the action of 
CNOOC in bidding for Unocal in 2005 despite central government oppo-
sition.98 Similarly, KPMG argues that ‘Chinese SOEs abroad have shown 
strong commercial motivations, similar to those of multinational corpora-
tions from developed countries’.99 Commercial motivations are evinced 
by SOE capital investments to secure stable and high-­quality supplies of 
natural resources, mergers and acquisitions to acquire new brands and 
­technology, accessing new markets and exporting Chinese brands.100
Moreover, in practice, multiple external parties are involved in Chinese 
SOE investment decision-­making abroad, including domestic consultants, 
corporate partners and financiers, such that decisions cannot be made 
solely by a government entity. Importantly, management may remain 
local. For example, Australian statistics show that Chinese investors have 
relied heavily on local talent to manage Australian companies in which 
the investor gains a controlling interest. Specifically, during the period 1 
January 2005 to 31 December 2012, Chinese nationals were appointed as 
chief executive officer only in 32 per cent of corporate acquisitions in the 
Australian energy and resources sectors, and chief operating officer in only 
10 per cent of the same.101
Thus, based on the empirical evidence, Chinese SOEs appear to be pur-
suing commercial opportunities in source-­rich foreign jurisdictions with 
  97  Brødsgaard (n 24) 633.
  98  Howson (n 23) 73, makes this point in relation to the CNOOC bid for 
Unocal, which was opposed by Chinese central government actors.

Barbara R. Kotschwar and Julia Muir, ‘Chinese Investment in Latin American 
Resources: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly’, (2012) Peterson Institute for 
International Economics, Working Paper No. 12–3.
100  Nonetheless, the regulatory framework is designed to set the parameters 
for the economic activities of large enterprises, and the CCP still controls the 
appointment of CEOs and presidents of the most important companies. See 
Brødsgaard (n 24) 633.
101  Li (n 77). However, it is important that, as a sign of potential investment 
practice change, Chinese private sector investment in Australia exceeded SOE 
investment in 2014, both in terms of volume (85% of total) and value (66% or 
AU$6.23 bn), see KPMG and University of Sydney (n 32) 3.

governmental blessing in much the same way as Western multinational 
corporations have done and continue to do.
CONCLUSION
China’s emergence as a prominent global investment actor – in terms of 
both FDI and ODI – is a phenomenon that can be better understood using a 
longitudinal lens. This chapter has sought to contribute to the growing body 
of literature on the duality of Chinese FDI–ODI by adding an historical 
perspective to the state capital story in order to look forward. By analyzing 
FDI and ODI data in the context of China’s Five-­Year Plans, which have to 
date been an underutilized contextual tool, we have viewed trade and invest-
ment patterns and ambitions from a Chinese perspective to shed light on 
China’s role as an outward investor and its strategic ODI ambitions.
Data detailed and discussed throughout this chapter show that: Chinese 
investments have occurred predominantly in mining/natural resources with 
emerging diversification toward energy, agriculture, and commercial real 
estate; and SOEs have been the primary modality of Chinese ODI abroad. 
Indeed, the advent of the 2001 ‘going global’ policy animated Chinese 
SOEs to move beyond mere trading relationships to active foreign asset 
and equity acquisition. In so doing, China has become a pervasive invest-
ment actor in nearly all markets and continents. Although SOE invest-
ment behaviour has triggered political concerns in some recipient nations, 
empirical data indicate that these SOEs appear to be pursuing commercial 
opportunities abroad as Western multinational corporations have done 
and continue to do. Indeed, it may be argued that concerns about the 
prevalence and potentially political nature of China’s SOEs reflect (and 
perhaps mask) deeper concerns about the increasing significance of China 
on the world stage.
Nonetheless, international predictions regarding global food security 
and China’s changing domestic demand–supply make clear that China’s 
significance as a global foreign investor, as well as a recipient of global soft 
commodities, will only continue to rise.
Arguably, these developments are consistent with China’s long-­standing 
traditions of trade and ODI, albeit with different emphases over different 
decades as evidenced in the Five-­Year Plans and documented throughout 
this chapter. From the economic advancement of the 12th century to the 
post-­war boom of the 1930s, from the relative isolation under Mao Zedong 
to the ‘open door’ FDI policy under Deng Xiaoping, to the ‘going global’ 
ODI strategy initiated under Jiang Zeming, it is clear that China’s signifi-
cance as a key global investment actor is remarkable and ever-­evolving.

Advancing accountability for Chinese TNCs11.  Capital market disclosure regimes: 
advancing accountability for Chinese 
TNCs
Virginia Harper Ho*
INTRODUCTION
One of the most significant economic transformations of the modern 
period is that global economic power is no longer wielded exclusively by 
sovereign states, but also by transnational corporations (TNCs), global 
corporate networks whose operations span jurisdictional and geographic 
boundaries. In response to the limits of jurisdictionally bounded legal 
systems, regulatory networks grounded on comity, international law and 
mutual assistance commitments have emerged as local regulators, and 
enforcement authorities work with their counterparts in other jurisdictions 
to reach the TNC on its own terms. Firm self-­regulation and voluntary 
regimes, such as the Global Compact, complement these responses by 
harnessing TNCs’ reputational interests and market incentives to drive 
corporate accountability. Within these evolving regulatory networks, the 
transnational nature of capital and information flows makes global capital 
market regulation an important source of accountability for TNCs, and 
one that directly shapes TNC’s market incentives.
Capital market regulation, a field that extends broadly to include rules 
governing investment products, trading mechanisms and the oversight of 
investment professionals and financial institutions, is grounded on disclo-
sure obligations that lie at the heart of domestic securities laws and stock 
exchange listing rules. Beyond the level of accountability produced by core 
financial disclosure, public reporting requirements in many markets have 
expanded to include non-­financial information on the firm’s environmen-
tal, social and governance (ESG) practices that may reflect its long-­term 
financial health, risk management practices and impact on stakeholders.1

This chapter examines how both traditional and emerging disclo-
sure obligations for listed firms serve as an important source of TNC 
accountability to investors and other stakeholders. It then presents 
a case study of the adoption of mandatory and voluntary reporting 
requirements by stock exchanges and securities regulators in mainland 
China. The potential role of capital market disclosure regimes in driving 
accountability for Chinese TNCs is particularly interesting because of 
the growing influence of Chinese TNCs in the global economy. China 
is also a leader among global capital markets, and its influence is likely 
to deepen with new reforms that are expanding access for foreign inves-
tors. China’s experience highlights the advantages of disclosure-­based 
regimes as a source of accountability for TNCs even in institutional con-
texts that limit the effectiveness of external monitoring and traditional 
regulatory tools.
CAPITAL MARKET DISCLOSURE REGIMES AND 
TNCs
As global firms, TNCs rely on public capital markets not only to fund their 
operations, but also to elevate their brand recognition in local markets 
and demonstrate their status as industry leaders. By going public, a TNC 
parent or subsidiary subjects itself to the listing requirements of the secur­
ities exchange and to regulatory authorities in each jurisdiction where 
its securities are traded. As a result, the TNC as a global organization 
becomes subject to greater scrutiny by investors and other stakeholders 
around the world.
Disclosure is central to the triple mission of modern securities law: ‘pro-
tecting investors; ensuring that markets are fair, efficient and transparent; 
and reducing systemic risk.’2 Strong securities markets require that minor-
ity investors have adequate information about the company’s business and 
that they enjoy protections from insider self-­dealing and opportunism.3 
The prevalence of disclosure requirements in modern capital markets 
also rests on the view most famously articulated by Louis Brandeis that 
indicators beyond environmental, social or governance factors, including human 
rights and sustainability.

­‘sunlight is . . . the best of disinfectants’ and a deterrent to fraud.4 In addi-
tion, accurate and timely information on the risk and potential return of 
investments enables capital to be efficiently allocated in the market and 
reduces market volatility.5
Accordingly, TNC affiliates that issue securities to the public must 
assume initial and ongoing reporting obligations.6 In addition, stock 
exchange listing rules impose corporate governance requirements, such 
as shareholder voting rights, that protect outside investors in listed firms. 
Firms that fail to comply with the listing standards of the exchange can be 
denied entry or, once admitted, can be sanctioned or de-­listed.
Transparency as a Regulatory Tool
By encouraging firms to alter practices that investors might view negatively, 
transparency mandates designed to advance the primary goals of secur­ities 
regulation can also directly incentivize changes in corporate behavior.7 
For example, mandating or encouraging disclosure of greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions may cause companies to voluntarily reduce pollution. 
Disclosure rules also help firms identify issues they might otherwise have 
failed to monitor. Disclosure can therefore motivate self-­regulation and 
align companies with broader public policy goals. These reporting obliga-
tions are also backed by the enforcement power of securities regulators 
and, in many jurisdictions, by shareholder litigation.
As a driver of accountability to investors, and indirectly to other stake-
holders, disclosure-­based regimes offer a number of advantages over 
­traditional regulation of TNCs by home or host governments:
Global reach
The global integration of capital flows, investor networks and information 
has placed TNCs within market systems whose power and reach exceed 
the bounds of traditional regulation. Public company reporting rules have

enterprise-­wide reach across the TNC and extend beyond any disclosure 
requirements that might apply to the TNC parent and its directors and 
officers under local corporate and securities law. Under consolidated 
reporting rules, ongoing reporting by a publicly traded TNC parent or 
subsidiary provides information about both the listed entity and any affili-
ates that it owns or controls.8 Some public reporting requirements extend 
further to contracting parties of the TNC, such as suppliers.9
Good governance
Transparency and other dimensions of good corporate governance are 
mutually reinforcing, promoting greater efficiency that benefits all cor-
porate constituencies. Disclosure regimes obligate firms to adopt internal 
monitoring and reporting systems that facilitate better monitoring across 
the TNC, and the strength of these internal systems and procedures deter-
mines, in part, the power of disclosure as a self-­regulatory tool. Disclosure 
also facilitates corporate governance by enabling minority shareholders to 
exercise their voting rights on an informed basis.
Market signals
In efficient markets, market prices provide signals to investors about the 
future value of the firm and give firm management an indication of inves-
tors’ reaction to new information about the firm or changes in market con-
ditions. If executive compensation is tied to clear performance measures 
that include both financial and non-­financial indicators, market signals 
may better align management incentives with both short-­ and long-­term 
firm value.
Peer benchmarking
Because mandatory disclosures must conform to specific format, content 
and timing requirements, they allow corporate performance to be readily 
measured against industry peers and other benchmarks. Benchmarking 
creates direct incentives for firm management, particularly when tied to 
executive compensation. Requiring specific disclosures regarding corpo-
rate governance matters, such as executive compensation, board structure 
and related party transactions, can also motivate firms to adopt best 
practices.

Flexibility
In contrast to costly and potentially ineffective one-­size-­fits-­all mandates, 
reporting requirements can be applied by firms of different scale and 
impact. Listed firms are industry leaders, so introducing new requirements 
for listed firms first also allows them to be tested by firms with the great-
est capacity to comply. ‘Comply or explain’ disclosure rules widely used in 
the United Kingdom, Europe and Asia, which require companies to either 
comply with a reporting obligation or explain why they do not, allow for 
even greater flexibility in application. Reporting requirements are also 
more flexible than direct regulation, in that they reach beyond a single 
regulatory space, such as environmental protection.
Public oversight
Disclosure complements direct public regulation by simultaneously facili-
tating investor and regulator oversight, as well as direct monitoring by the 
public, NGOs and other interested stakeholders. Harnessing market pres-
sure and the threat of reputational harm in this way can directly impact 
TNC practice, often on a global basis.
The Scope of Disclosure and Accountability for Stakeholder Impacts
The extent to which disclosure can motivate greater TNC accountability 
depends in part on its power to focus TNCs on costs, risks and impacts 
that might not otherwise have been adequately monitored or mitigated. 
However, the goal of the public reporting rules is not complete disclosure, 
but rather disclosure of all material information necessary to comply with 
reporting requirements and to render those disclosures not misleading, 
including material non-­financial information . The US Supreme Court has 
defined information as material if it is substantially likely to be ‘viewed by 
the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the “total mix” of 
information made available’ to them.10 Although definitions vary some-
what across jurisdictions, international and US materiality standards are 
substantively the same.11 False or misleading disclosures and material 
omissions can subject the firm or its principals to administrative, civil or 
criminal penalties, or to civil damages claims by the firm’s shareholders.
Mandatory reporting for listed firms has historically been limited

to financial measures and other material information that might affect 
­investors’ risk–return calculation and the future value of the listed company, 
although some of this information may require firms to account for their 
impact on corporate stakeholders. For example, in 2010, the US Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued policy guidance emphasizing the 
potential materiality of climate change impacts for listed firms and linking 
climate change impacts to existing financial reporting requirements.12 
Pending legal or administrative claims and known and quantifiable risks 
may arise from poor ESG practices, and prospective or ‘forward-­looking’ 
information based on management’s best estimates of market changes 
may also relate to sustainability or other ESG factors.13 However, the rules 
governing financial reporting in most markets have not directly taken into 
account the stakeholder-­oriented concerns that motivate standard debates 
on the accountability of global firms, and stakeholder impacts in many 
jurisdictions are communicated to the market largely through voluntary 
sustainability or ESG reporting.
A key limitation of current disclosure-­based regimes in advancing 
accountability for TNCs is the poor quality of information available to the 
capital markets about firms’ management of non-­financial, stakeholder-­
related risks and other ESG factors.14 To be meaningful to the markets, 
information must be material, timely, reliable, comparable and presented 
in a consistent way over time. Financial reporting generally satisfies 
these conditions because it is produced in accordance with accounting 
standards, such as International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 
or US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and it is backed by 
mandatory audits using standardized procedures. A number of standard-­
setting organizations, including the Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board (SASB) in the United States and global organizations, such as the 
International Standards Organization (ISO), the International Integrated 
Reporting Council (IIRC) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), 
have developed tools designed to standardize reporting of material non-­
financial indicators, but the quality and comparability of non-­financial

reporting within and across markets lags behind standard financial 
measures.
However, regulators, investors and other market participants increas-
ingly acknowledge the potentially material effect of companies’ attention 
to employees, creditors, communities and other stakeholders on long-­term 
corporate financial performance, investment risk and return, and even 
systemic risk to entire economies.15 Stakeholder impacts and related regu-
latory compliance are also widely recognized as within the scope of the 
risk management function and the duty of corporate boards to monitor 
management and the firm’s legal and compliance risk.16 These conclusions 
are supported by a growing academic literature demonstrating that firms 
that operate more responsibly, manage risk effectively and adopt sound 
corporate governance practices can obtain financing from lenders and 
investors at lower cost.17 Such firms may also do better at preserving value 
for investors than other firms of comparable size and financial strength.18 
Empirical studies also support a link between good corporate govern-
ance, widely recognized as essential to long-­term financial success, and 
­responsible or sustainable business practice.19
Over 50 governments, including emerging markets like India, South 
Africa and indeed, China, have already endorsed these findings by intro-
ducing mandatory ESG reporting requirements.20 Others, such as the 
US SEC, have enacted disclosure rules directed at specific stakeholder 
concerns, such as human rights impacts, as part of standard financial

Stock exchanges in most developed markets and a growing number of 
emerging markets, including Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico and 
Thailand, have committed to improving ESG disclosure and performance 
among listed companies.22 These measures have added to growing pres-
sure from investors, consumers and interest groups, leading to significant 
increases in the level of non-­financial reporting over the past decade, 
deepening corporate accountability for material stakeholder impacts and 
related indicators that may ultimately affect financial performance.23
CAPITAL MARKET DISCLOSURE REGIMES IN 
CHINA: A STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVE
Any discussion of TNC accountability must take into account the role of 
Chinese TNCs and Chinese capital markets. Chinese TNCs are not only 
global leaders in foreign direct investment in developed markets such as 
Australia, Europe and the United States, but their influence is also deeply 
felt in Africa and other parts of the developing world. Most Chinese TNCs 
are publicly traded domestically, as well as in Hong Kong and on other 
leading exchanges. In addition, China now ranks second globally after the 
United States based on the combined market capitalization of listed com-
panies on China’s two primary exchanges in Shenzhen and Shanghai.24 In 
2010, China surpassed the United States as the largest market for initial 
public offerings (IPOs) globally, reflecting a broader shift in public listings 
from developed to emerging markets.25
China’s regulatory regime for listed firms has relied heavily on disclosure 
since its inception, and most Chinese TNCs also produce sustainability 
reports that reflect to some extent the firm’s attention to stakeholder

­interests.26 While the weaknesses of standard financial reporting are 
mirrored in the poor quality of ESG reporting by Chinese firms, deeper 
integration of local and global capital markets and concerns about market 
volatility are increasing pressure on firms and on China’s securities regula-
tor, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), to strengthen 
reporting practices and market oversight. Although these pressures alone 
cannot transform TNC practice, China’s experience suggests that capital 
market disclosure regimes can be an important driver of accountability for 
emerging market TNCs.
Disclosure Regimes for Listed Firms
Capital market regulation is arguably more important than company law 
in the governance and oversight of Chinese TNCs. Since Chinese firms 
first began to list their shares in Hong Kong and then on the mainland in 
the early 1990s, capital market regulation and, in particular, securities law, 
has been the dominant force in the formation of Chinese corporate gov-
ernance principles for listed firms.27 Although the 1993 version of China’s 
Company Law imposed only general disclosure obligations on a corpora-
tion’s supervisors, directors or officers,28 Chinese authorities recognized 
early on that information disclosure was essential to the creation of viable 
public capital markets. In the late 1990s, the Shanghai Stock Exchange 
took the lead by introducing disclosure concepts that directly influenced 
the CSRC’s 2001 Code of Corporate Governance for Listed Companies, 
China’s first national corporate governance standard.29
Financial reporting
China’s Securities Law and related regulations establish a system of 
ongoing reporting for all listed firms on an annual, semi-­annual and

interim basis. These rules require disclosure of various aspects of cor-
porate governance, including executive compensation, director inde-
pendence, the composition of the board, the identity of controlling 
shareholders and other blockholders, and related party transactions.30 
As in other markets, periodic reporting also requires some reference to 
matters that relate to the firm’s impact on stakeholders, including man-
agement’s discussion and analysis addressing major events and risks 
affecting the firm, as well as material disputes, investigations, losses or 
similar events.31
Financial reporting is based on Chinese accounting and audit stand-
ards, which now converge substantially with IFRS and international audit 
standards.32 All disclosures must be authentic, accurate and complete 
without any false or misleading statement or material omission, as attested 
by the company’s directors and senior managers, and a listed firms’ direct­
ors, supervisors and senior managers bear joint and several liability for any 
misleading statements or material omissions.33
The CSRC approves new issues, exercises enforcement authority over 
listed firms and oversees the stock exchanges, financial intermediaries and 
auditors.34 Chinese TNCs that are publicly traded within China are also 
subject to the listing requirements of its major exchanges: the Shanghai 
Stock Exchange (SHSE), the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE), and 
China’s over-­the-­counter market, the National Equities Exchange and 
Quotations (NEEQ). Although particular requirements apply to separ­
ate indices and boards, the listing rules’ disclosure provisions are largely 
uniform across the exchanges.
ESG reporting and accountability for stakeholder impacts

ability policies and state-­driven approach to corporate social responsi-

­implements its 2016 framework for establishing a green financial system.35 
Although not directly enforceable, this emphasis is already reflected in 
the Company Law and in the CSRC’s Code of Corporate Governance for 
Listed Companies, which encourage listed companies to consider stake-
holder interests, in addition to legal compliance and adherence to business 
ethics.36 Since 2006, China has also adopted a number of sustainability 
initiatives and ESG reporting requirements for state-­owned enterprises 
(SOEs) and other large firms. These measures reflect central policies 
promoting sustainable development and the global competitiveness of 
Chinese TNCs, and they complement voluntary sustainability report-
ing regimes created by international and domestic organizations and by 
local trade associations and governments across China.37 Although ESG 
reporting guidelines in China are generally voluntary, ESG reporting is 
explicitly mandatory for most Chinese TNCs, either because of their 
status as listed firms or as SOEs, or because of their industry sector or 
scale.
Beginning in the early 2000s, the State Environmental Protection 
Agency (SEPA), now known as the Ministry of Environmental Protection 
(MEP), joined with several other administrative agencies to promote better 
environmental compliance by large Chinese firms under a series of green 
finance policies. Among these was a green securities policy formalized by 
the CSRC and the MEP between 2007 and 2009, which required environ-
mental disclosures and performance assessment for listed firms. It also 
included a Green IPO component, which required companies in highly 
polluting industries that wished to launch an IPO or make a later offering 
of securities to pass an environmental assessment.38 Although the Green

IPO policy was discontinued in late 2014, while it was in force the CSRC 
aggressively enforced it to block listings of polluting firms.39 Other MEP 
environmental disclosure guidelines remain in effect for listed firms and are 
slated to be expanded and more closely linked to financing opportunities 
for Chinese firms under the 2016 recent green finance policy guidelines 
and new rules designed to help “green” companies access public capital 
markets.40
In 2008, the SHSE also adopted environmental disclosure guidelines that 
are mandatory for firms in certain extractive sectors, companies that are 
included in the SHSE Corporate Governance Index, companies that are 
cross-­listed in China and on a foreign market, and financial ­companies.41 
These guidelines cover firm environmental performance and encourage 
disclosure of information regarding pollution levels and mitigation efforts; 
reporting is, however, required for all firms on the MEP’s list of serious 
polluters. In addition, all listed companies must report within two days 
on any environmental liability or investigation, serious environmental risk 
events, or other circumstances that may have a significant impact on the 
stock price.42 These interim disclosures alert investors of potential risk 
exposure and give authorities additional notice of serious environmental 
incidents.
In addition, the 2016 green finance framework reinforces broader 
obligations toward stakeholders that are explicitly referenced in guide-
lines adopted initially by the stock exchanges and later by the Ministry 
of Finance, the CSRC and the National Audit Office regarding internal 
financial controls and enterprise risk management systems, which are

mandatory for all listed firms in China, and for certain other large firms.43 
In contrast to most Western jurisdictions, the relevant guidelines expli­
citly require monitoring of financial and non-­financial risks that relate to 
­corporate stakeholder impacts.
Beyond the SHSE’s environmental disclosure guidelines, both stock 
exchanges have also adopted CSR reporting guidelines for listed firms that 
urge them to protect the interests of creditors, employees and other stake-
holders and to issue regular ESG disclosures.44 Although sustainability 
reporting is voluntary for most firms under these CSR guidelines, it is in 
fact mandatory for Chinese TNCs that are in the Shenzhen 100 Index or, 
in Shanghai, for firms on the SHSE Corporate Governance Index, other 
listed firms that are cross-­listed abroad, and financial companies.45 In 2009, 
both exchanges added incentives for voluntary reporting by introducing 
separate sustainability indices, which encourage firms to adopt governance 
and disclosure best practices and signal their credibility to the market.46 
New green indices, rating systems, environmental reporting requirements 
and green investment vehicles building on ESG measures are contemplated 
by the 2016 green finance framework.47
Additional sustainability reporting requirements already apply to

Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC).48 The 2008 
SASAC CSR Guidelines for Centrally Managed SOEs encourage the 
integration of CSR practices into corporate governance and strat-
egy,  as  well  as voluntary ESG reporting. In 2012, SASAC began to 
mandate ESG reporting for SOEs directly controlled by the central 
government.49
The level of sustainability reporting has risen rapidly in China in 
recent years, driven by these regulatory mandates and demand from 
international consumers, global industry leaders and state policy.50 
Nearly 80 per cent of China’s top 100 firms now produce sustainability 
reports, on par with leading Western firms.51 As of the end of 2016, 
over 500 Chinese companies were signatories of the United Nations’ 
Global Compact, discussed separately in this volume, which requires 
participating firms to report annually on progress toward mitigating 
­stakeholder-­related risks.52
Institutional Context and the Limits of Disclosure
Beyond its core function in promoting the efficiency, stability and equity 
of public capital markets, disclosure’s potential as a regulatory tool 
depends on its power to motivate corporate behavioral change. However, 
as a self-­regulatory tool, disclosure is subject to firm discretion regarding 
what and how to report. Unreliable information weakens market signals 
and incentives for firms to alter their underlying conduct, undermining the 
market’s ability to allocate capital efficiently in a manner that accurately 
reflects investment risk.
These concerns are particularly salient in China. Although China’s 
disclosure regime follows global models and the informational efficiency 
of its capital markets has improved,53 inadequate, misleading, and even

fraudulent disclosure practices remain endemic.54 Accounting scandals 
and disclosure violations continue to dog Chinese firms cross-­listed in 
the United States and other global markets. Similarly, numerous studies 
of ESG reporting in China find that while the quantity of ESG report-
ing by Chinese firms has risen dramatically since 2008, its overall quality 
remains weak, with wide industry variation55 Relatively few firms report 
quantitative indicators or negative events such as regulatory investigations 
or penalties.56 Less than five per cent of the sustainability reports produced 
by firms in China are independently audited by a third party.57 Although 
voluntary and mandatory reports are publicly available either on company 
websites or directly through the stock exchanges, and global ESG invest-
ment analytics are beginning to incorporate data from Chinese-­listed 
firms, integration of ESG information directly into investment analysis 
is in its infancy and is made more challenging because of the dearth of 
­quantifiable, comparable metrics.
Part of the explanation for the low quality of mandatory reporting in 
China is that the institutional context of China’s capital markets limits 
effective external monitoring and enforcement that might motivate higher 
quality reporting and deter fraud. Like other markets where concentrated 
ownership is the norm, Chinese firms exhibit an insider governance model, 
with control wielded by management and controlling shareholders who 
do not stand to benefit from greater transparency.58 The dominant role of 
the state in the governance of Chinese TNCs and other listed firms may 
also affect disclosure quality,59 since by some estimates, over 80 per cent 
of Chinese-­listed firms, which include most Chinese TNCs, are indirectly, 
if not directly, state-­owned or controlled.60 The opacity of related party

transactions, in particular, can expose minority investors and other cor-
porate stakeholders to a greater risk of tunneling, managerial ­rent-­seeking 
and other forms of expropriation by controlling shareholders.61 This reality 
is in tension with the informational demands of public capital markets and 
the interests of minority investors, who enjoy formal legal protections 
under China’s Company Law.62
In markets that rely on disclosure regimes, the power of ongoing report-
ing requirements lies in the anti-­fraud requirements of the securities laws, 
which are backed by the enforcement authority of securities regulators 
and the stock exchanges, by the threat of civil and criminal liability for 
individual directors and officers and for listed firms, and by the gatekeep-
ing role of accountants, lawyers and auditors. Disclosure regimes are also 
informally enforced through reputational sanctions, since listed firms seek 
to maintain investor confidence, and markets react negatively to public 
investigations.
In China, however, none of these mechanisms are robust. Traditional 
gatekeepers have proven unable or unwilling to promote transparency, 
the market for corporate control does not effectively constrain controlling 
shareholder opportunism, and the threat of private legal remedies remains 
weak.63 Although China’s Securities Law gives investors harmed by false or 
misleading disclosures the right to claim damages from the company and 
its directors, supervisors, officers or other employees, such claims are rarely 
brought against widely held listed firms.64 Alternative dispute resolution 
mechanisms have been established to resolve securities-­related disputes,65 
but procedural limits, the relative weakness of the Chinese courts, and the 
challenge of litigating against powerful local and state interests dissuade

private enforcement by investors. In addition, individual retail investors, 
who tend to adopt short-­term, speculative investment strategies, hold 80 
per cent of the tradable shares of listed firms, by market capitalization.66 
In other emerging markets, institutional investors, who are more likely to 
have an influence on listed firms, hold on average around 40 per cent of 
the shares.67
As a result, the burden of policing disclosure quality and protecting 
minority investors falls to the stock exchanges, the CSRC and its local 
subdivisions. The CSRC has the authority to issue warnings and correc-
tion orders, disqualify financial intermediaries, levy fines on listed firms 
and individual supervisors, directors and officers, as well as suspend or 
de-­list a firm.68 The CSRC also has the authority to sanction accountants, 
auditors and lawyers in connection with disclosure or other violations 
of the securities laws, in addition to litigation by investors. In contrast to 
securities regulators in other markets who do not engage in merit review 
of mandatory disclosures, the CSRC also conducts regular onsite visits to 
listed firms, and selected review of financial disclosures in annual reports 
for approximately 20 per cent of all listed firms each year.69 Serious disclo-
sure violations may give rise to criminal liability, and in recent years the 
CSRC has referred nearly half of the case leads it received to the police for 
criminal investigation.70
Since the late 1990s, a significant number of investigations by the CSRC 
have involved disclosure violations.71 One study by Liebman and Milhaupt 
of CSRC enforcement strategies also found that reputational sanctions 
against individuals are an effective deterrent.72 Despite heightened regula-
tory enforcement in recent years, however, serious penalties against firms, 
responsible individuals or their advisors are relatively rare, and available 
administrative sanctions are too weak to discourage violators.73

Another explanation for the deficiencies in current reporting practices is 
that protecting minority investors matters less to Chinese-­listed firms and 
to the state since, as in Europe, equity markets are less important sources 
of funding for large Chinese firms than banks or intra-­group financing 
outside the public markets.74 The CSRC is also hampered by personnel and 
resource constraints, as well as the need to coordinate with other agencies, 
such as the MEP, the Ministry of Public Security and other financial regu-
lators to enforce disclosure rules.75 Studies of mandatory environmental 
disclosures under the green securities program suggest that compliance 
with the basic reporting obligation might be more consistent if the CSRC 
had not left enforcement largely to the relatively weak MEP.76 For all 
of these reasons, reporting practices in China lag behind international 
standards.
Toward Accountability for Stakeholder Impacts
The observed weaknesses in core financial reporting and the limits of 
external monitoring by the CSRC and outside investors would seem to 
challenge the argument that capital markets’ disclosure rules can mean-
ingfully constrain TNC managers and promote greater accountability to 
corporate stakeholders. However, measuring the implementation of capital 
markets regulation in China against more mature markets may not be the 
best comparison. A better question is how effective capital markets regula-
tion is relative to other sources of oversight for Chinese TNCs, and from 
this standpoint, capital markets regulation in fact enjoys a comparative 
advantage. Its strength lies in the potential for disclosure-­based rules to 
shape listed firm incentives, as outlined earlier, and also in the positive 
pressure the CSRC and other state agencies face to improve investor con-
fidence, attract global capital and raise the reputation the Chinese capital 
markets themselves.
Institutional power
Transparency mandates are an important driver of greater accountability 
for Chinese TNCs because the institutional position of the CSRC gives it 
greater influence over TNCs than most other state agencies. The state’s 
strong interest in bolstering confidence and stability in Chinese capital 
markets has allowed the CSRC to deepen reforms favoring minority

­investors against other entrenched state interests, and the CSRC’s tech-
nical expertise and its mandate to improve confidence in China’s public 
capital market also enable the CSRC to introduce rules that constrain 
state-­controlled firms in a way that other agencies and the courts cannot.77 
Because the securities exchanges and direct administrative enforcement 
of the securities laws are both under the CSRC’s authority, it has 
greater power than its counterparts elsewhere to move listed firms toward 
­transparency and better governance.
Direct state oversight of leading TNCs
In addition, the state has direct external and internal control over many 
of China’s leading TNCs that goes beyond the regulatory oversight of the 
CSRC. In China, SASAC and its local branches exercise the governance 
rights of shareholders, as well as administrative and personnel oversight 
over SOEs. The alignment of state regulatory policy in areas like environ-
mental protection is therefore an important driver behind recent trends 
in ESG reporting by Chinese TNCs. Although empirical evidence of the 
effect of state ownership on disclosure quality in China is mixed, some 
studies suggest that state control improves disclosure of environmental 
performance and other ESG factors that are aligned with state sustainable 
development policies.78
Because many Chinese TNCs are large, state-­sector firms that are 
expected to adopt global standards, top-­down mandates have proven 
particularly powerful in expanding the scale of sustainability reporting. 
Over half of sustainability reports are produced by state-­owned firms,79 
and empirical studies have shown that the 2008 SASAC CSR Guidelines 
had an observable effect on the level of sustainability reporting by listed 
SOEs even before they became officially mandatory in 2012.80 This evi-
dence points to the strong state influence over SOE disclosure practices. 
At the same time, even centrally controlled SOEs are more likely to 
issue ­sustainability reports when the firm is subject to stock exchange

­mandates.81 The emphasis by SASAC and by the stock exchanges on sus-
tainability reporting therefore appears to be mutually reinforcing.
In addition, national policy priorities on sustainability and a desire to 
take greater leadership on the international stage have led the Chinese 
government to engage actively with international standard-­setting bodies 
focused on the development of integrated reporting frameworks and 
other sustainable finance tools. China’s 2016 green finance guidelines are 
a prime example. They build on prior green finance policies and outline 
far-­reaching goals designed to encourage the CSRC, the stock exchanges, 
and financial institutions to direct capital toward investments that promote 
environmental sustainability and a transition toward a green economy. 
The 2016 guidelines also signal new demand for ESG analytics and 
­sustainability information from regulators and market participants.
Capital market competition and institutional investor influence
An important shift in Chinese capital markets that might motivate better 
implementation of existing disclosure rules is the growing presence of 
institutional investors. One recent survey by the International Organization 
of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) found that its members in emerging 
markets, including China, view foreign institutional investors as having a 
positive impact on market liquidity, corporate governance and financial 
innovation.82
Several reforms over the past decade have strengthened listed firms’ 
potential responsiveness to market oversight by increasing the public float 
of listed firms and expanding the space for foreign ownership of Chinese 
TNC shares. Historically, shares of Chinese-­listed firms were strictly 
divided into separate markets, with trading in A shares denominated in 
RMB limited to domestic investors and trading in dollar-­denominated 
B shares limited to foreign investors. In addition, until the late 2000s, 
non-­tradable shares, largely held by various governmental entities (‘state 
shares’) or by industrial firms or other institutions (‘legal person shares’) 
accounted for over two-­thirds of listed company shares, leaving public 
investors particularly vulnerable to exploitation.83 Far fewer shares are 
now restricted from trading, and the aggregate public float of listed firms 
on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges represents over 80 per cent 
of the total outstanding shares.84

Although still relatively small, the size of institutional investment in the 
Chinese market has increased steadily since the early 2000s, as has the will-
ingness of some institutional investors to engage listed companies directly 
on corporate governance matters.85 China’s 2016 green finance framework 
also contemplates new measures mandating that state-­owned institutional 
investors incorporate environmental indicators into investment analysis 
and encouraging others to do so.86
In addition, since 2002, qualified foreign institutional investors (QFIIs), 
and since 2011, QFIIs with RMB accounts (RQFIIs), have been permit-
ted to trade in restricted shares of domestic firms denominated in RMB 
(‘A shares’) through a quota system.87 Although less than 2 per cent of A 
shares are currently held by QFIIs,88 QFIIs’ presence in the market creates 
reputational incentives for the CSRC, SASAC and other regulators to 
improve the quality of public listings and strengthen minority investor 
protections.
In 2014, China raised the bar higher by introducing the Shanghai–
Hong Kong Stock Connect program, which opened a broader segment 
of China’s domestic capital markets to foreign capital, mediated through 
Hong Kong-­based brokers and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEx).89 
The program, which is being expanded to Shenzhen at the time of this 
writing, also allows wealthy Chinese investors to invest in firms listed in 
Hong Kong, creating greater competition between the HKEx and main-
land exchanges. Allowing domestic markets to compete more directly 
with Hong Kong and exposing them to higher transparency demands 
may increase pressure on mainland firms to improve reporting quality and 
also pave the way for proposed plans to allow foreign firms to list locally, 
a change which could make public capital more expensive for firms with 
weak transparency. These developments raise the prospect that China

will follow the experience of continental Europe, where the expansion 
of outside minority investors led to improvements in mandatory and 
­voluntary disclosure by listed firms.90
Peer benchmarking and public oversight
Public reporting also facilitates stakeholder monitoring, and in China, 
direct public oversight of firm’s compliance with local environmental, 
labor or consumer protection regulation through traditional and online 
media, petitioning government agencies, and even public protest, is 
increasingly common. There is also some evidence in China that peer 
benchmarking and spillover effects from industry leaders to other firms 
are driving observed improvements in the level of non-­financial reporting 
by Chinese TNCs, and to a smaller extent, in its quality.
Voluntary firm adoption of international reporting standards by some 
Chinese firms also signals a deeper level of commitment to accountability 
for stakeholder impacts. Nearly 70 per cent of sustainability reports pro-
duced by Chinese TNCs and other reporting firms are based on an inde-
pendent third-­party standard.91 Although a growing number of Chinese 
TNCs issue sustainability reports through the Global Compact or other 
regimes, the primary non-­financial reporting standards used in China 
are the GRI standards and reporting standards developed by the CSR 
Research Center of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.92 The GRI 
standards are explicitly designed to make sustainability reporting standard 
practice globally for all organizations.93 In other emerging markets, such as 
South Africa, South Korea and Brazil, 90 per cent of leading firms use the 
GRI, and many governments recommend or require GRI-­based report-
ing.94 The number of Chinese TNCs based in mainland China that use the 
GRI itself has risen from only 13 in 2008 to nearly 2000 in 2016.95
Top-­down pressure does not explain these trends. Although the 2008 
SASAC CSR Guidelines and existing environmental reporting rules encour-
age adoption of international standards, they do not require any particular

New analytical tools are now being developed by state agencies, local 
organizations within China, and international organizations, such as the 
GRI, to evaluate the quality of ESG reporting in China in order to facili-
tate the use of ESG metrics by firms, external stakeholders and, eventually, 
investment analysts.97 The GRI and CASS have coordinated their two 
leading standards,98 and the most recent green finance framework outlines 
plans to institute a state-­funded system for standardizing environmental 
cost accounting metrics and to establish a publicly accessible database of 
reported data that can be accessed by institutional investors, regulators, 
rating agencies and companies themselves.99 As these metrics improve, firms 
will face increasing pressure from industry peers and administrative author-
ities to improve the quality of voluntary and mandatory ESG reporting.
Cross-­listing and bonding
Foreign capital markets and their regulators are another important source 
of accountability and oversight for Chinese TNCs. Cross-­listing gives 
TNCs and their affiliates access to cheaper and more diverse sources of 
capital, and companies may also choose to list on a foreign exchange with 
a reputation for tougher governance and transparency requirements in 
order to achieve a bonding effect.100 According to conventional bonding 
theory, firms can obtain capital more cheaply by assuring investors that 
they are subject to tougher oversight that is perceived to be lacking in 
their home market. Although limited cross-­border enforcement capacity 
weakens bonding effects in practice,101 cooperation among regulators and 
  96  Although this hypothesis has yet to be tested empirically, it is supported by 
other studies of voluntary disclosure by Chinese firms, finding that industry peer 
influence and reputational factors affect firms’ decision to produce ESG disclo-
sures. S.X. Zeng et al., ‘Factors that Drive Chinese Listed Companies in Voluntary

exchanges, as well as market discipline from foreign investors, investment 
intermediaries, and external auditors and other gatekeepers create new 
sources of external monitoring for cross-­listed TNCs. Firms cross-­listed 
in more developed markets or those that are highly covered by investment 
analysts also exhibit better social performance, perhaps because of their 
improved transparency.102
The potential effect of external oversight is significant since Chinese 
TNCs list their shares on foreign exchanges in record numbers. Because of 
its proximity, cultural affinity and established institutions, Hong Kong has 
historically been the leading international market for mainland Chinese 
firms since the early 1990s when the first SOEs were authorized to go 
public. Nearly 400 mainland Chinese firms or their subsidiaries are listed 
in Hong Kong, accounting for over 40 per cent of the market capitalization 
on the HKEx main board and around 10 per cent of its Growth Enterprise 
Market (GEM).103 Approximately 200 of these Chinese TNCs also list in 
New York, London or other global markets.104
Like other major markets, Hong Kong has a disclosure-­based system 
that depends upon self-­regulation by the HKEx and on the gatekeeping 
function of market intermediaries, acting under regulatory oversight.105 
Mainland Chinese firms that wish to list overseas directly must obtain 
approval from the CSRC and comply with additional governance and 
accounting rules under both Chinese domestic law and the listing rules of 
the foreign securities exchange.106 In Hong Kong, listing rules for mainland 
firms impose heightened corporate governance standards, such as man-
dating the presence of an internal compliance advisor, extending fiduci-
ary duties to the supervisory board and providing for preemptive rights 
and arbitration.107 To facilitate cross-­border enforcement, Hong Kong’s 
securities regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission, has entered

regulators.108
Like Shenzhen, Shanghai and other Asian stock exchanges, the HKEx 
has also introduced measures to promote listed firm attention to sustain-
ability or ESG issues in recent years, including a Corporate Sustainability 
Benchmark Index, guidance encouraging institutional investor monitoring 
of investee companies’ ESG performance, and mandatory ESG reporting 
for listed firms.109 Consistent with its 2014 revised Companies Ordinance, 
Hong Kong’s ESG reporting requirements were introduced as voluntary 
guidelines but now apply to all issuers on a ‘comply or explain’ basis.110
Although the evidence on whether Hong Kong offers better investor 
protection is mixed,111 cross-­listing has subjected Chinese TNCs to higher 
scrutiny, particularly with regard to the quality of their public report-
ing. Studies of non-­financial reporting also find that reporting quality 
is highest for firms listed on the HKEx, followed by firms listed on the 
Shanghai Exchange.112 Although information gaps may weaken bonding 
effects, Chinese TNC subsidiaries cross-­listed in the United States have 
also come under increasing scrutiny from US regulators in the wake of 
accounting and disclosure scandals involving Chinese firms, and regula-
tors in both the US and in Hong Kong have suspended or de-­listed a 
number of Chinese companies.113 In contrast to other areas of foreign 
host–state regulation, securities disclosure regimes can bring market forces 
and host state enforcement capacity more directly to bear on listed TNCs.
CONCLUSION
Stock exchanges, securities regulators, leading institutional investors 
and other international organizations recognize the power of disclosure 
regimes to promote greater accountability for TNCs. Investors in global 
companies are also facing growing demand from regulators and the public

for transparency and accountability regarding how they deploy capital 
and how they monitor the firms in which they invest.114 Most critically, 
authorities in emerging markets around the world are adopting disclosure-­
based tools to refocus TNCs and institutional investors toward the long-­
term and to improve monitoring of ESG risks and stakeholder impacts.115 
Leaders in this space include regulators in South Africa and Brazil, as well 
as China’s Asian neighbors – Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and 
South Korea, among others.116 Like China, these regulators are increas-
ingly transitioning from voluntary ESG reporting to mandatory standards 
that more readily lend themselves to peer benchmarking and verification.
At the same time, the persistence of accounting scandals and securities 
fraud in Western markets shows that disclosure-­based regimes are not a 
substitute for tough enforcement of basic home and host state regulation. 
The quality of core financial reporting also depends on strong market-­
based incentives and external institutions, which are not uniform across 
global capital markets. These challenges are heightened for ESG report-
ing, and, as China’s latest green finance framework recognizes, regulatory 
mandates may be needed to improve the use of materiality standards and 
comparable quantitative indicators.
However, China’s experience shows that disclosure obligations, a key 
condition for access to public capital markets, can be an important source 
of TNC accountability even where internal governance and external over-
sight are weak. It also shows that the need to ground strong capital markets 
and compete internationally can in fact motivate governments to adopt 
minimum transparency and governance standards within home state law. 
Implementation challenges certainly persist, but as the gap between the 
long-­term interests of investors and stakeholders narrows, global capital 
market networks will play an increasingly important role in shaping TNC 
incentives, operations and impacts.

INTRODUCTION
Globalisation has encouraged transnational corporations (TNCs) to seek 
to minimize their overall tax liabilities, and they do so in a number of ways. 
One of these is to seek to locate their operations in a low tax jurisdiction 
such as Ireland or Singapore. Many countries actively try to offer tax 
incentives to encourage TNCs to set up their operations in their jurisdic-
tions. Another strategy is to manipulate the costs of inputs in different 
jurisdictions and seek to ensure that profits are made in a low-­taxing juris-
diction through the use of transfer pricing strategies.4 TNCs are very sensi-
tive about the amount of tax that they have to pay; this is especially where 
risks, exploration costs and mining costs are high, and where ore prices can 
be volatile. As a result TNCs will often threaten moving to other countries 
if these costs are too high. Alternatively, they may go to great lengths to 
undermine government efforts to introduce new taxes.5 This was a choice 
that confronted multinational mining companies in Australia when the 
Australian Labor Government sought to introduce a minerals resources 
rent tax in 2010. Due to fiscal crises, national governments are increasingly 
in need of revenues; yet, they are often easily intimidated by threats or 
campaigns from mining industry multinationals or TNCs.
Due to declining government revenues as a result of tax base erosion 
and profit shifting (BEPS), the payment of taxes by transnational corpo-
rations has been a matter of increasing concern to governments around 
the world; however, governments have been reluctant to act unilaterally in 
imposing additional taxes upon powerful TNCs.6 Where national govern-
ments do seek to act unilaterally against TNCs from powerful countries, 
such as US internet companies, the companies may seek protection from 
their own national governments.7
As a result, collective governmental action to deal with this problem 
through multilateral bodies, such as the Organisation for Economic 
Co-­operation and Development (OECD), has been preferred, but these

actions have been slow to bear fruit. Globalization has meant that TNCs 
operate in many jurisdictions and, as rational economic actors, seek to 
minimize their tax obligations by any legal mechanisms available to them. 
It has been estimated that at least 60 per cent of international trade takes 
place within rather than between transnational corporations.8
In seeking to minimize their tax liabilities, TNCs often seek to curtail 
efforts by national governments to subject them to higher or even more 
efficient taxes. The use of mechanisms such as transfer pricing has helped 
to minimize the tax liabilities of companies within corporate groups by 
adjusting prices charged for transactions within the group so that the 
income is recorded in the accounts of the subsidiary located in a low-­tax 
jurisdiction or in a tax haven.9 Whilst transfer pricing is not necessarily 
illegal, mispricing transfers may well be illegal. Shifting profits from a 
high-­tax to a low-­tax jurisdiction has also been seen as an attractive means 
for corporate groups to minimize their overall tax obligations.
This remained a problem for Australian governments after the multi­
nationals successfully defeated the federal government’s resources rent tax 
as illustrated by State government complaints that companies such as BHP 
Billiton would sell minerals from Australia at a low price to a subsidiary 
company (a marketing hub) located in Singapore, and then that company 
would sell these minerals to its customers in the international market at a 
much higher price. The TNC, however, paid mining royalties based on the 
lower price, rather than the eventual sale price.10
The taxing of multinational mining companies has also been a matter

of heated debate in Australia for over half a century. These debates 
have come to a head as governments have found themselves struggling 
to deal with declining national tax revenues. Dominque Strauss-­Kahn, 
the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has 
argued that:
The International Monetary Fund has for many years paid close attention 
to the special challenges faced by resource-­rich countries. Those relating to 
macroeconomic and budgetary management have long figured in our surveil-
lance work and lending arrangements, and we continue to champion initiatives 
towards greater transparency in the extractive industries. And in our technical 
dialogues with resource-­rich countries, the design of fiscal regimes has also been 
a central topic – an especially lively and active one in the last few years of high, 
and, more especially, volatile, commodity prices.11
The OECD and the G20 have combined to seek solutions, such as creat-
ing the ‘Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project’.12 However, tax minimi-
zation schemes do not only affect G20 countries; developing countries lose 
over $100 billion as a result of such measures each year.13
Tax base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) schemes used by TNCs have 
been of increasing concern globally.14 In 2014, the meeting of the G20 held 
in Brisbane discussed measures to combat such BEPS schemes.15 Later 
that year, the Australian Treasurer at that time, Joe Hockey, suggested 
that Australia should follow the UK in imposing the so-­called Google tax

on multinationals which shifted their profits to low-­taxing jurisdictions.16 
Subsequently, the UK introduced its ‘diverted profits tax’ measures, 
and the Australian government introduced the Tax Laws Amendment 
(Combating Multinational Tax Avoidance) Bill which includes a targeted 
anti-­avoidance law in Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 
(Cth) aimed at multinationals that artificially avoid having a taxable 
­presence in Australia.
Treasurer Hockey was reported to have said that he was ‘absolutely 
determined to ensure that companies that earn their profits in Australia 
pay tax to the Australian government.17 Australian government leaders, 
such as the former federal Treasurer Joe Hockey, have continued to search 
for a more modern system for taxing multinationals companies in a 
­globalised world.18
Australia’s opposition Labor party was also concerned that $2 billion 
in taxes had been evaded by multinational companies operating in 
Australia.19 However, industry groups, such as the Minerals Council of 
Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the 
Business Council of Australia, were critical of Labor’s efforts to crack 
down on tax avoidance by multinationals operating in Australia.20 Chris 
Jordan AO, the Commissioner of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) 
also took an interest in this issue.21
Mining company BHP Billiton was one of the companies under scru-
tiny by the ATO; this TNC had earlier led the revolt in Australia against 
the imposition of the Minerals Resources Rent Tax (discussed below). In 
2015, BHP Billiton revealed that between 2006 and 2014, it had only paid 
US$121,000 in taxes on its profits of US$5.7 billion earned by it through 
its marketing entity based in Singapore; BHP claimed that it also paid 
$945 million in Australia on these profits; however, the ATO was still

­claiming that it was entitled to some $522 million in unpaid taxes from 
BHP Billiton.22
In 2015 BHP Billiton representatives resisted the efforts of an Australian 
Senate inquiry into the payment of taxes by multinational companies; the 
inquiry sought to obtain details of TNC tax payments, although much of 
that information was publicly available in Singapore.23
Although other mining companies, such as Rio Tinto, were more open 
than BHP Billiton, other multinationals appearing before the Senate mul-
tinational tax inquiry (such as Microsoft, Google and Apple) had also 
used offshore marketing hubs in places such as Singapore to minimize 
their taxes, but they resisted efforts to reveal how they paid tax on their 
Australian business operations.24 Subsequently, ATO Tax Commissioner 
Chris Jordan reportedly told the Senate Committee that the claims by 
TNCs, such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, that they are not engaged in 
profit shifting should not be taken at face value.25
Multinational mining companies in Australia now seem to have fallen 
silent on the subject of tax reform, despite concerns about the need for tax 
reform expressed by political leaders from both major Australian political 
parties, such as former Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey and Opposition 
Leader Bill Shorten,26 as well as by the Senate Committee examining tax 
practices of multinational companies.

Australia’s future tax system undertaken by the Secretary of the Australian 
Treasury, Dr Ken Henry; section 3 discusses the Australian Mineral

THE HENRY REVIEW INTO AUSTRALIA’S FUTURE 
TAX SYSTEM
Australia’s tax problems were reviewed in 2009 by a committee chaired by 
the then-­Secretary of the Australian Treasury, Dr Ken Henry. In its report 
on Australia’s future tax system, the Henry Review made a number of 
recommendations, including one that recommended that Australia enact a 
broad ranging resource rent tax:
The current resource charging arrangements imposed on non-­renewable 
resources by the Australian and State governments should be replaced by 
a uniform resources rent tax imposed and administered by the Australian 
government.27
Subsequently, the Revised Explanatory Memorandum to the Minerals 
Resource Rent Tax Bill 2011, considered by the Senate, explained that:
Resource rent taxes are profit-­based, cash flow, taxes. They differ from most 
royalties in that they take into account the profitability of a mining operation. A 
resource rent tax collects a percentage of the resource project’s economic rent.28
Due to the finite supply of non-­renewable natural resources, the Henry 
Review noted that large mining companies were able to earn profits that 
would be higher than normal from their exploitation of non-­renewable 
mineral resources; in such circumstances the imposition of rents was 
appropriate. As the Henry Review explained:
Rents exist where the proceeds from the sale of resources exceeds the cost of 
exploration and extraction, including a required rate of return to compensate 
factors of production (labour and capital) . . . However, economic rents can

persist in the resources sector because of the future supply of non-­renewable 
resources.29
Because onshore mineral resources in Australia belong to the Crown 
in right of State Governments, such resources are seen as a public asset, 
and it is accepted that the private sector should be charged for the right to 
exploit these mineral resources; mining companies therefore pay royalties 
to State governments. Some State governments, such as Western Australia 
and Queensland, have come to rely heavily upon such mining royalties.30
Some minerals, such as iron ore and coal, account for the bulk of royal-
ties received by States; in New South Wales, for example, coal accounts 
for almost 96 per cent of the royalties received by that State.31 The Henry 
Review argued that ‘Australia should seek an appropriate return from these 
resources.’32 A well-­designed national resources rent tax was seen by the 
Review as a more effective means of achieving this goal than the payment 
of royalties; this was because such a tax was less likely to distort investment 
and production decisions.33
The Henry Review recommended that this new resource rent tax be 
levied by the national government at the rate of 40 per cent and that it 
should be applied to non-­renewable resources such as petroleum and 
uranium, bulk commodities such as black coal and iron ore, base metals, 
diamonds and mineral sands; an exception to the tax would be provided 
in relation to some lower value minerals.34 A number of options were 
­presented regarding the future of existing State-­based royalty regimes.35

In recommending the enactment of this resources rent tax, the Henry 
Review referred to earlier models for such a mining tax that had been 
proposed in an early paper by EC Brown in 1948 and again by Garnaut 
and Clunies Ross in their 1983 book, Taxation of Mineral Rents.36 As a 
longstanding subject of interest among economists, the ideal of a resources 
rent tax was far from new, but implementing a theoretical model would 
prove to be politically very difficult.
However, the complexity of the scheme proposed to the Australian 
Government by the Henry Review, especially in regard to its compliance 
costs, led to considerable resistance from domestic and international mining 
companies in Australia, as well as from State Governments. The Henry 
Review controversially suggested that the proposed resources rent tax would 
in effect create a partnership between government and mining companies:
Essentially, under a resource rent-­based tax, the government is a silent partner 
whose share in the project is determined by the tax rate. However, each partner 
contributes something additional to the partnership – private firms contribute 
rents associated with their expertise and the government contributes rents asso-
ciated with the right to the community’s non-­renewable resources. These rents 
are also shared according to the tax rate.37
As we will see below, the ‘partnership’ model would not be well received 
by local or global mining companies who were to be subject to this new tax. 
As Paul Kelly, a senior journalist working for The Australian newspaper 
observed, BHP Billiton ‘had never conceived of the idea of government 
being a 40 per cent project partner.’38
Subsequently, the Australian Labor Government accepted the Henry 
Review’s mining profits tax recommendations and hastily sought to enact 
a resources rent tax without obtaining agreement from the mining industry 
and State governments. Professor Garnaut noted that the Henry Review

had laid out the policy framework that the Government relied upon in its 
proposal for a Resources Super Profits Tax:
A Committee chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury has prepared an uncom-
promising statement of one conscientious perception of the national interest in 
an important area of policy. The Government has embraced the statement, and 
made it a central feature of an overall fiscal program that, if maintained, would 
have no near comparator in the developed world for rigour or suitability to the 
circumstances.39
Professor Garnaut added:
[T]he Australian Government has taken a position on the basis of advice of 
people of knowledge and standing, that asserts some hard propositions about 
the national interest, at the expense of some private interests that exercise con-
siderable influence in our polity . . . It is critically important to our future that 
we are able to discuss hard policy proposals on their merits, so that an informed 
perception of the public interest can emerge and eventually win broadly based 
support.40
However, in 2010 Garnaut also warned that the government was likely 
to encounter difficulties when it confronted powerful sectional interests in 
the form of multinational mining companies. It is therefore appropriate 
to closely examine the nature of the Australian resources rent tax and the 
obstacles to the passage and implementation of this law that were raised by 
Australian mining industry companies, led by TNCs such as BHP Billiton, 
Rio-­Tinto and Xstrata, and exploited by opposition political parties.
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT’S MINERALS 
RESOURCES RENT TAX
In May 2010, the Australian Labor Government, under Prime Minister 
Kevin Rudd, floated the idea of the Minerals Resources Rent Tax after 
limited discussion within the government and limited consultation with 
the mining industry; in July 2010 amendments were made to the proposed 
new law. Thereafter, the Australian Senate Select Committee on New 
Taxes began an inquiry into the proposed mineral resources rent tax on 30 
September 2010, and a report from this inquiry was published on 29 June 
2011. Much happened between the announcement of the tax by the Rudd

Labor Government in May 2010 and its eventual enactment by the Gillard 
Labor Government.
The Rudd Government’s proposed Resources Super Profits Tax (RSPT) 
was reworked under the Gillard Government into a Minerals Resources 
Rent Tax (MRRT) and the Federal Treasurer introduced the MRRT into 
the House of Representatives on 2 November 2011; thereafter a package of 
bills relating to the proposed new tax was referred to the Australian House 
of Representatives’ Standing Committee on Economics; the Committee 
reported back to the House on 21 November 2011.
The Senate, the upper house of the Australian Parliament, also consid-
ered the new MRRT41 and then referred the Bill to the Senate’s Economics 
Legislation Committee which reported back on 14 March 2012. In a 
minority report, the Opposition parties opposed passage of the new leg-
islation, arguing that it was: ‘divisive, complex, unfair, fiscally irrespon-
sible and distorting, reduces our international competitiveness and was 
­developed through a highly flawed and improper process.’42
In a submission to the Economics Legislation Committee regarding the 
provisions of the MRRT, the local mining company, the Fortescue Metals 
Group, and the Institute of Public Affairs argued that the legislation could 
even be unconstitutional.43 These concerns were eventually to find their 
way into the High Court of Australia where the Court was to reject these 
constitutional law claims.44
The MRRT Bills were passed by both Houses of Parliament; the House 
of Representatives doing so on 23 November 2011 and the Senate nar-
rowly passing the Bill on 19 March 2012, with the support of the Greens 
and Clive Palmer’s Palmer United Party.45 The Opposition parties, led by

43  Arguably, the MRRT was in breach of s 51(ii) of the Australian 
Constitution, as the Bill would discriminate between the States; States imposed 
different Royalties upon companies within their jurisdictions. It was also argu-
able that the Bill was in breach of § 114 of the Constitution which prohibits the 
Commonwealth from imposing a tax on any property that belongs to a State. This 
was relevant as minerals in Australia are owned by the Crown in the right of the 
States.

Tony Abbott, fought the 2013 federal elections with the intent of repeal-
ing the MRRT, and the tax law was eventually repealed on 2 September 
2014. Many of the problems with the legislation could be attributed to 
inadequate consultation with the mining industry and state governments.
Inadequate Consultation with the Mining Industry
The question has often been raised as to the manner in which the mining 
industry had been consulted before the new mineral resources rent tax was 
introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament. Whilst various models 
of a minerals resources rent tax had been circulating among economists 
in Australia for many years, and a previous Coalition federal Government 
had earlier enacted the much narrower 1986 Petroleum Resource Rent 
Tax46 in the face of some industry opposition; the form of the new broader 
resources rent tax was not easy to sell. In a lecture in 2010, Professor Ross 
Garnaut observed that:
We are all aware that the manner of public disclosure of such a new, large 
and complex policy was not world’s best practice, taking industry by surprise 
with announcement of changes of immense financial consequences. Given 
the manner of the announcement, the immediate industry reaction was 
understandable.47
Initially, the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA) in its submission to 
the Henry Review panel stated that it was prepared to accept the principle 
of a profits-­based tax. Also, the CEO of BHP-­Billiton reportedly at first 
did not, in principle, oppose a resources rent tax, although it was believed 
that the tax was likely to affect Australia’s competitiveness.48 Subsequently, 
as Paul Kelly has noted, the MCA was prepared to make a deal; but, unfor-
tunately, ‘Labor did not want a deal’ as they saw the tax as an electorally 
attractive vehicle for them.49
As Ken Henry said of this Labor attitude: ‘They thought the resources

tax was a dead-­set political winner for them.’50 The new mining tax was 
given a provocative populist title (as the Resources Super Profits Tax) and 
became a key feature of the 2010 budget, as the government projected that 
it would raise $12 billion in its first two years.51
Mining companies were, however, concerned about the possibility of 
an even broader resources tax being imposed; this created anxiety in the 
mining industry. According to Wayne Swan, the Labor Treasurer at the 
time, the mining companies therefore assumed the worst:
The mining companies knew the [Henry] report had been handed to the govern-
ment just before Christmas [2009]. When, week after week, month after month, 
it was not released publicly they became increasingly anxious. This long period 
of silence caused the companies to assume the worst. It also allowed them much 
more time to prepare their campaign in opposition to the reforms.52
Swan argued that when the mining companies complained that they had 
not been consulted on the new tax, this was ‘untrue’ and was merely an 
attempt at ‘rewriting of history’. He noted that:
Companies met with the Henry panel and the government on numerous occa-
sions throughout the review period. Indeed, the panel even discussed options for 
a resources rent tax with industry ahead of delivering its report to government.53
There was a delay in publicly circulating the mining tax recommendations 
of the Henry review as Prime Minister Rudd was slow to accept that such 
a tax was appropriate.
The situation was made more complex because of distrust between the 
Prime Minister and Mining Minister Martin Ferguson.54 As Paul Kelly 
explained the problem, ‘Rudd was disengaged and Ferguson was excluded 
from the policy decision.’55 As a result of distrust of Ferguson, he was not 
briefed on the details of the new tax ‘until very late in the process’ although 
he was allegedly ‘not caught unawares in relation to both the intent and the 
design of the policy approach’ proposed by Henry.56 Also excluded from 
Labor’s policy making process was Dr Craig Emerson, a Labor Member

of Parliament who had previously worked as an economist with Ross 
Garnaut. As Maxine McKew noted:
Emerson constantly tried to buy into discussions but was blocked. The ANU-­
trained economist could see the problems. As he says, the RSPT ‘is theoretically 
elegant but practically useless’ because it ropes in the government as a co-­owner 
and joint risk partner in the development of the country’s minerals wealth. The 
industry did not want a bar of it.57
Emerson had long argued that the inefficient system of State-­based 
mining royalties should be replaced by a more efficient tax on profits and 
not a tax on the amount produced by miners.58
One of the reasons for this antagonism to the idea of a partnership 
was suggested by Chris Richardson, a well-­known economist from Access 
Economics. In June 2010 Richardson noted that the imposition of a 40 
percent tax by the RSPT taxed ‘effort and entrepreneurial expertise (at 40 
per cent) as well as mineral resources rents.’59
In his account of this period, Swan argued that Rudd distrusted 
Ferguson ‘because he was close to the mining industry and he represented 
the sector’s interests inside the government.’60 The full details of the Henry 
recommendations were not widely known before Prime Minister Rudd and 
Mining Minister Ferguson announced a Resources Super Profits Tax on 
2 May 2010; this was shortly before the federal government’s budget was 
handed down in May 2010 by Treasurer Swan.
Legislative Design Faults and the Failure in Tax Law Making
The speed with which the tax was enacted after the release of the Henry 
Review’s recommendations meant that various major design flaws were 
inevitable. Probably the most serious of these was the breadth of the reach 
of the tax, as it applied to high-­value mining activities (iron ore and coal) as 
well as to low-­value minerals (sand and gravel). Swan subsequently regret-
ted this over-­reach of the proposed law.61 Another design flaw ­concerned 
the refunding of losses incurred by mining companies.
Unfortunately for Labor’s proposals, Swan had failed to utilize all of the

expertise that was available within the Party; this included Mining Minister 
Martin Ferguson, Craig Emerson (an MP who had completed a PhD on 
the taxation of petroleum resources) or Gary Gray, a Western Australian 
member of parliament who had been the Labor Party National Secretary 
and a corporate adviser of Woodside Petroleum. As McKew points out: 
‘[t]he combined expertise of Gray, Ferguson and Emerson could have been 
harnessed earlier by Swan to work with industry, get the details right and 
arrive at a sensible middle ground position – one that industry could live 
with.’62
Although the mining industry had for some years called for a loss 
refundability provision in the tax system in regard to exploration expenses, 
in the context of the MRRT, Swan later acknowledged that ‘in reality it 
was a red flag to the mining company bullies who argued publicly that 
they should bear the risk for their investments.’63 In the end, these design 
flaws and a poor process of law-­making, coupled with bitter indus-
try ­opposition, dealt a death blow to the legislation. As Swan observed, 
‘[g]ood policy, frustrated by insufficient process, had crashed head-­on with 
powerful vested interests.’64
In commenting on the process involved in the passage of the minerals 
tax, Professor Garnaut noted that although the manner in which the RSPT 
had been introduced was not ideal, there was a need to balance public and 
private interests in this debate:
We are all aware that the manner of public disclosure of such a new, large 
and complex policy was not world’s best practice, taking industry by surprise 
with announcement of changes of immense financial consequence. Given the 
manner of the announcement, the immediate industry reaction was under-
standable . . . Now, the future prospects of the resources industries and the 
living standards of the Australian people depend on the assertion of private 
interests soon being balanced by considered, independent and soundly based 
­assessments of the public interest.65
The poor process was evident in the nature of the consultation phase. 
Limited efforts were made to brief the mining industry in late April; former 
Treasurer Swan noted that ‘some of the major companies were brought 
into the Treasury and briefed thoroughly on its contents. This occurred on 
Thursday 29 April. They were required to sign confidentiality ­agreements

because they were presented with the entire details of the package.’66 
Numerous meetings with senior mining company officials also apparently 
took place immediately after the new tax package was announced.67
All of this activity was occurring just after the peak of the Global 
Financial Crisis and at a time that Australia was seen as having a ‘two 
speed economy’, the rich mining states (especially Western Australia which 
raised more than 50 per cent of state mining royalties) versus the other 
states that were suffering from an economic downturn. Constitutionally, 
the states had power to collect mining royalties, but the Commonwealth 
Government’s new mining tax sought to bypass the States, so that state 
governments, such as that in Western Australia, were actively opposed to 
the new mining tax. As Paul Kelly noted,
Labor never properly addressed the role of the states . . . There was no formal 
consultation with the states. This is because the problem would have required 
protracted dialogue with little prospect of agreement.68
Prime Minister Rudd was reportedly shocked when, at a Council of 
Australian Government (COAG) meeting69 in April 2010, he heard from 
Colin Barnett, the Premier of Western Australia, that his State would not 
compromise its powers to collect mining royalties to facilitate the new RSPT.70
THE NATIONAL ANTI-­TAX CAMPAIGN: THE ROLE 
OF BHP BILLITON
Soon after the proposed new tax was announced, the mining industry 
commenced a national media campaign against the tax. There were con-
cerns that the tax would significantly diminish the profits of multinational 
mining companies. The Financial Times even reported that:
Analysts estimated that the new tax would cut earnings at BHP Billiton, the 
Melbourne-­based mining group, 19 per cent. London-­based Rio Tinto, which 
operates highly profitable iron ore mines in Western Australia, could suffer a fall 
of nearer 30 per cent.71

Marius Kloppers, the chief executive of BHP Billiton, was reported to 
have warned:
If implemented, these proposals seriously threaten Australia’s competitiveness, 
jeopardise future investments and will adversely impact the future wealth and 
standard of living of all Australians.72
When combined with the unpleasant notion of the tax being seen as a 
partnership between industry and government, this level of tax was seen as 
likely to have a significant impact on BHP Billiton’s shareholder returns. 
The chief executive of the Minerals Council of Australia opined that the 
new tax would make the mining industry in Australia the most highly taxed 
mining industry in the world:
Australia’s hard-­earned reputation as a stable investment environment will be 
dramatically undermined . . . If the government’s new tax proposal goes ahead, 
A$108bn worth of future investment in the minerals industry will be under a 
cloud.73
Former Treasurer Swan described the industry campaign as involv-
ing ‘blackmailing’ scare tactics in which ‘the big mining companies were 
deliberately, unnecessarily and selfishly fanning uncertainty.’74 On the 
other hand, leading mining industry figures, such as the Rio Tinto man-
aging director, reportedly ‘believed the industry had been misled and 
ambushed.’75
The mining industry also argued that the tax created a sovereign risk for 
Australia.76 The CEO of Rio-­Tinto concluded that Australia was the main 
sovereign risk for his company.77 A greater concern of the global mining 
industry was that the successful introduction of the Australian mining tax 
might create a precedent for other countries, especially in the developing 
world, that had expressed interest in such a tax.78
BHP Billiton reportedly believed that the RSPT would have global ramifi­
cations as other countries would be likely to follow Australia’s ­example.79

Although BHP has had a long association with Australia,80 as a conse-
quence of a number of mergers, only 24 per cent of the shareholders in 
BHP Billiton were domiciled in Australia; in the case of Rio-­Tinto, only 16 
per cent of its shareholders were Australian.81
One TNC played a leadership role in the attack on the proposed new 
mining tax. As Paul Kelly noted, BHP Billiton’s CEO:
Kloppers assumed the leadership role in the anti-­tax campaign. The ‘war room’ 
was established at [its headquarters at] Lonsdale Street in Melbourne . . . BHP 
Billiton believed it had been ‘set up.’82
Other groups were also brought together to support the attack on 
the tax. These included the Minerals Council of Australia, the Business 
Council of Australia, financial analysts, the media and the Opposition 
parties under Tony Abbott. As Kelly noted:
The Minerals Council-­paid advertising campaign began on Friday 7 May after 
the [Government’s] announcement. The campaign was run from its Canberra 
HQ . . . Spanning fifty-­four days, the campaign cost $25 million . . . It ranks . . . 
as the best special-­interest campaign in recent decades.83
In addition:
An early priority for Kloppers was to persuade the Business Council of Australia 
to line up against the tax. The miners put a priority on the financial analysts . . . 
In effect, the financial sector was recruited. Kloppers’ aim was to dismantle the 
RSPT by a punitive assault, an extraordinary step for his company. It revealed 
the complete breakdown between the world’s biggest mining company and the 
Rudd Government.84
In addition to these lobbying efforts to stop the tax, BHP Billiton organ-
ized a meeting with leading figures in the Opposition led by Abbott; this 
would provide the basis for the subsequent electoral defeat of the Labor 
Government. Abbott would ‘enshrine the RSPT as an election winning 
issue,’ according to Paul Kelly.85 Similarly, Maxine McKew noted that 
­following the announcement of the RSPT in the May 2010 Budget:

The acrimony unleashed by the miners’ campaign, along with Abbott’s oppor-
tunistic rejection of any proposal for increased taxation, was the dramatic 
backdrop to the events that led directly to Rudd’s removal as Prime Minister.86
Swan later observed that he did not think that the mining industry was 
serious about consultation and were instead preparing for a ‘war’ against 
the tax.87 Swan argued that industry interest in consultation was ‘some-
what disingenuous’ and, in regard to one leading mining company officer,
I have subsequently learned that at the time we were talking, his company was 
setting up a ‘war room’ in its headquarters, headed by a very senior public 
affairs practitioner, to coordinate the industry’s campaign against the RSPT.88
It should also be noted that heads of leading domestic Australian mining 
companies, such as Andrew Forrest of the Fortescue Metals Group, Gina 
Rinehart of Hancock Prospecting and Clive Palmer also protested publicly 
against the RSPT. The former Labor Treasurer, Wayne Swan, was aghast 
at the reaction of billionaires who were ‘protesting at having to pay more 
tax on the mineral resources they were ripping out of the ground.’89
Burrell’s biography of Forrest notes that ‘[n]ever before had a protest 
against injustice been led by two of the richest people in the land [Forrest 
and Rinehart].’90 Forrest later went so far as to launch a failed constitu-
tional challenge against the Commonwealth Government’s MMRT which 
by then had replaced the RSPT. Forrest was concerned that his iron ore 
mining company (Fortescue) ‘would not exist under the RSPT.’91
Prime Minister Rudd sought to split the mining industry opposition 
to the RSPT by cutting a deal with Forrest and his company, Fortescue 
Metals Group (FMG), on 20 June 2010, three days before his resignation 
as Prime Minister.92 But this deal fell far short of an agreement with the big 
three multinational mining companies.93 The deal with Forrest would not, 
however, have stopped the advertising campaign against the government

that was being driven by BHP, Rio and Xstrata.94 Once Rudd was removed 
as Prime Minister, BHP, Rio and Xstrata no longer needed the assistance 
of Forrest as they were now able to organize their own deal with the new 
Prime Minister, Julia Gillard.95
In collaboration with the Federal Opposition parties, led by Tony 
Abbott, a massive media campaign against the resources rent tax arose; 
this involved television, print and radio advertisements. Abbott was 
reported to have said at this time that the mining tax would destroy the 
resources boom. He echoed industry warnings when he proclaimed that: 
‘[p]utting a great big tax on the mining industry is like handicapping our 
most successful athletes. It’s bound to drive investment and jobs overseas.96
The industry’s advertising campaign against the new tax commenced 
in early May. The Australian newspaper was seen by Swan as launching 
an ‘extraordinary’ attack on the Government’s new tax in May 2010. This 
campaign also mobilized ‘numerous companies in the supply chain of the 
very large mining houses’ which were advised that they, too, were at risk 
because of the mining tax and were urged to join the campaign against the 
tax. Some of these companies were reportedly even threatened that they 
would not receive further work if they did not join the campaign being led 
by the multinational mining companies.97
GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO SETTLE THE MINING 
DISPUTE
One effect of the mining industry campaign was to create popular 
concerns about Prime Minister Rudd, leading some within the Labor 
Government to create a leadership crisis which led to Julia Gillard 
replacing Rudd as Prime Minister. Gillard then saw the resolution of 
the mining tax campaign as one of her most pressing concerns as Prime 
Minister. The mining tax thus became the ‘fatal blow’ to the Rudd Labor 
Government.98
Kelly also noted that although the new mining tax ‘was feasible and sale-
able’, its formulation and implementation failed badly as ‘Labor got the 
timing, design and politics wrong.’99 This was because:

Transnational corporations and mining tax reform in Australia    ­359
Every rule of established tax reform practice – consultation with stakehold-
ers, ministerial assessment of bureaucratic advice, cultivation of the terrain 
for reform – was breached. Yet this was the central tax reform of Rudd’s first 
term . . . Rudd and Swan had taken the justified idea of a resources tax on 
profits and botched it. They provoked the mining sector into a political war 
and left much of the business community convinced they were untrustworthy.100
As a result, Prime Minister Gillard sought to rescue the situation that 
the government had found itself in:
As one of her first acts as Prime Minister, she phoned Marius Kloppers, the 
CEO of BHP. Her ‘ceasefire’ proposal to Kloppers and the mining companies – 
getting them to agree to pull their TV ads as a condition of negotiation – was 
her first big call as prime minister.101
Gillard called for a new discussion on the design of the RSPT, which was 
to be rebranded as the Mineral Resources Rent Tax (MRRT). Paul Kelly 
notes that ‘Gillard would offer more than just peace; it became fiscal sur-
render’ with the watered down MRRT principles being effectively drafted 
by leading mining industry figures. This process of reviewing the tax com-
menced in late June with meetings between Treasurer Swan and Mining 
Minister Ferguson, representing the government, and BHP’s CEO Marius 
Kloppers, accompanied by other mining industry representatives from Rio 
Tinto and Xstrata.102
On 30 June senior BHP Billiton executive Gerard Bond sent a draft tax agree-
ment to Swan’s office. The main company was involved in drafting the deal. 
The ‘heads of agreement’ dated 1 July was signed by the big three miners plus 
Gillard, Swan and Ferguson. The new Minerals Resources Rent Tax (MRRT) 
was no ordinary government decision, based on formal agreement with the ‘big 
three’ it was a shared decision.103
Thus, on 2 July 2010 it was agreed to impose the mining tax on only two 
commodities, iron and coal. It was also agreed to reduce the rate of tax on 
profits from 40 per cent to 30 per cent. Furthermore, the tax would not 
apply to smaller mining companies with profits of less than $50 million 
per year. It was calculated that the new tax would collect $10.5 billion over 
the forward estimates period, and $4.4 billion over four years. The actual 
amount of revenue collected was projected to be around $200 million, in

large part due to fall in ­commodity prices and to the tax deductions avail-
able for new mining investment.104 The MRRT was eventually abolished by 
the Abbott Government on 3 September 2014.
As Sarah-­Jane Tasker observed at the time that the MRRT was repealed:
The world’s biggest miners, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Xstrata, helped draft 
the MRRT with Wayne Swan and Julia Gillard, creating a watered-­down 
version of Kevin Rudd’s resources super profits tax. Australia’s miners had 
spent $17.1m on a campaign against Mr Rudd’s original proposal. The cam-
paign, spearheaded by the Minerals Council of Australia, was one of the most 
expensive run by an industry against a government on a single policy issue.105
Following the repeal of the MRRT, the new Coalition government 
weakly called upon TNCs to pay more tax and eliminate situations in which 
TNCs avoided paying any taxes at all through the use of profit shifting to 
low tax jurisdictions.106 This led to calls for further reduction of company 
tax rates in Australia, given that popular offshore jurisdictions such as 
Ireland imposed an attractive corporate tax of only 12.5 per cent.107 There 
were also calls for greater transparency in tax practices of multinationals.
Some mining company leaders, such as Rio Tinto chair Jan du Plessis, 
later pointed out that the use of complex and artificial tax minimization 
schemes by TNCs should be avoided as their use ‘impacts upon your repu-
tation and if you are in the mining business, that impacts your ability to 
invest and I think is short sighted.’108 However, the bitterness generated 
by both sides of the debate over the enactment and repeal of the MRRT 
was so extensive that, as the Australian Financial Review suggested, ‘It has 
poisoned the ground against genuine reform.’109

Transnational corporations and mining tax reform in Australia    ­361
After the 2015 Senate hearings in Canberra into multinational taxation, 
Laura Tingle from the Australian Financial Review commented that:
For Labor, the revelations are particularly bitter. They show that, even as the 
miners were campaigning to fight not just the contentious mining tax but the 
loss of any other tax concessions and trumpeting the huge amount of tax 
they were paying to keep our fine country going, they were busily establishing 
arrangements that have allowed them to drastically cut their Australian tax bill.
Tingle added:
But the politics of these revelations are much more devastating for a business 
community in perpetual search of lower taxes. As we can see from the [Mineral 
Council of Australia’s] approach to the tax discussion paper, the revelations that 
nobbled the industry’s capacity to take part in the new tax debate. The miners 
have been in damage control, with the MCA releasing floods of figures to show 
how they pay lots of tax after all.110
The government’s mining tax reform efforts had been roundly defeated 
by a mining industry led by three large TNCs. Further tax reform debates 
then had to take place in an environment of bitterness and mistrust poi-
soning the landscape for reform.
CONCLUSIONS
Globalization has made TNCs some of the principal actors in markets. 
Although it can be argued that they are not always more powerful than 
governments,111 TNCs have certainly been very powerful actors in tax 
reform discussions in Australia. In the case of the defeat of the Rudd 
Government’s Resources Super Profits Tax, TNCs were overwhelm-
ingly effective in mobilizing opposition and working to rewrite the draft 
legislation.
When a watered down version of the tax was passed by the Gillard Labor 
Government, it was a temporary outcome. The TNCs’ campaign against 
the tax had provided support to the position of the opposition parties 
who were able to rely upon the ill-­will created by the campaign against the 
poorly drafted tax to defeat the Gillard Government. This eventually led to

Financial Review (1 May 2015) 39.

the repeal of the Mineral Resources Rent Tax in September 2014, bringing 
this episode to a close.
In the meantime, the government’s serious problems of base tax erosion 
continued; these problems had contributed to government moves in 2010 
to enact the mining tax. Subsequent revelations at Australian Senate hear-
ings into the tax planning practices of large multinationals working in 
Australia served to illustrate that mining industry TNCs continued to resist 
efforts to ensure that they met their tax obligations. State governments 
have continued to have problems in collecting mining royalties from TNCs, 
and the Australian Taxation Office remains locked in dispute with large 
mining companies for unpaid taxes as a result of complex tax planning 
schemes.112
Despite some statements of verbal support for the introduction of more 
efficient mining tax laws, the collective power of mining industry TNCs 
in response to an unpopular mining tax was clearly sufficient to defeat 
government efforts to introduce such a tax in Australia. This will certainly 
send a message to other governments to rethink any ideas about seeking to 
impose unwelcome taxes upon powerful globally powerful TNCs.

Transnational corporations in Papua New Guinea13.  Risks and fiscal concerns in the 
extraction of natural resources: a study 
of transnational corporations in Papua 
New Guinea
Diane Kraal
1.  INTRODUCTION
Transnational corporations (TNCs) dominate the extraction activities of 
high-­value mineral resources in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Except for a 
brief period around the granting of independence from Australia in 1975, 
the ensuing discussion in the chapter will show how PNG’s scarcity of 
technical expertise and capital has affected its negotiating leverage with 
extractive industry TNCs. These TNCs have generally been in stronger 
positions when negotiating the fiscal terms of their operations with the 
PNG Government.
Academic research concerned with extractive industries often consid-
ers issues around economic, social and environmental ramifications of 
relevant host country policies. Common economic enquiries ask ques-
tions about the real or spill-­over benefits of mineral extraction to a local 
economy.1 Socially orientated investigations into the impact of mining 
typically cover land rights, indentured labour, colonial class differences, 
displacement, dispossession and disempowerment of indigenous peoples.2

364    Research handbook on transnational corporations
The environmental discourse on mineral extraction overwhelmingly covers 
damage to land and its overall degradation.3
By contrast this chapter investigates the risks and the fiscal challenges 
for TNCs operating in the natural resource sector in the host country of 
PNG. It examines the importance of fiscal negotiations for formal agree-
ments between a host country, which is endowed with natural resources, 
and extractive TNCs. The chapter contextualizes the extraction activi-
ties and taxation of a developing country and the impact of institutions, 
including agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and other 
global financial bodies on host country policies.
For background, the chapter reflects on the past mistakes of TNCs in 
the mining of copper and associated minerals around the Ok Tedi River in 
PNG’s Western Province, and at the Panguna mine on Bougainville Island. 
The chapter then shifts to the latest TNC investment of major significance: 
the extraction of natural gas from fields in PNG’s Southern Highlands and 
Western Provinces, and its processing into liquefied natural gas that is now 
being exported.
Given the PNG record of poor fiscal outcomes and operational disasters 
from copper and gold mining, a key question of the chapter is: Will the 
current and significant natural gas project improve PNG’s tax revenues? 
Further, Do the recent and successful natural gas activities in PNG reflect 
any initiatives for social and environment issues or changes in regulatory 
controls? Finally, What are the wider lessons from this case study for other 
extractive industry TNCs?
The chapter proceeds as follows. Section 2 concerns the colonial past 
in PNG’s mining and hydrocarbon (oil and gas) industries, with Section 
3 considering the immediate post-­World War II period, and from inde-
pendence up to 1992. Section 4 is about lessons for TNCs arising from the 
Bougainville copper mining-­related civil uprising, and the Ok Tedi mine’s 
environmental damage. Sections 5, 6 and 7 look at institutional inter-
est in PNG; the latest gas project in PNG, renewed TNC interest in the 
country; and whether PNG’s current tax reforms will court sovereign risk. 
In conclusion, Section 8 summarises the overall risks and fiscal concerns 
for TNCs extracting natural resources in PNG and the wider lessons from 
the findings.

2.  THE COLONIAL PAST
The colonial era shaped attitudes towards mining in PNG. In the wake 
of the late 19th century advance by European powers for territory in 
the Pacific region, the island of New Guinea was divided. The eastern 
part of the island of New Guinea was divided between Germany to 
the north (German New Guinea) and Britain (British Papua) to the 
south.4 In 1902 Britain transferred British Papua to Australian admin-
istration and renamed it the Territory of Papua. German New Guinea 
­formally came under Australian administration post-­World War I and 
later the territories became the Territory of Papua–New Guinea.5 In 
1973 self-­government was granted to the Territory, and in 1975 it was 
granted full independence as the Independent State of Papua New 
Guinea.
2.1  Gold
Gold mining prospectors moved into Port Moresby in British Papua as 
early as 1877, and from there moved westward and inland.6 The colonial 
administration in Port Moresby failed to control these alluvial miners, 
who continued to mount prospecting expeditions. Conflicts with the 
indigenous people ensued, and the Administration gave tacit support 
to the miners by sending punitive expeditions. The result was an exten-
sion of administrative control to the miners, for courses of action were 
frequently decided by prospecting parties rather than by official regula-
tion.7 The appointment of Resident Magistrates stationed at goldfields 
was a further instance of the mining industry being given the opportunity 
to influence the pattern of administration. The colonial Administration 
financed the construction of public works, such as tracks, which were 
clearly for the benefit of the mining community, rather than the local 
indigenes.
Prison inmates provided cheap labour for colonial mining projects, 
and the general shortage of labour, indirectly forced the indigenous 
people to participate in the economy, ‘both while preserving a façade of

legality’.8 The Administration’s encouragement of the minerals industry 
in Papua was primarily designed to benefit the colonial power and its 
investors, whether resident in Papua or back home. Companies registered 
in Australia were the most active miners, and capital was drawn from 
investors in eastern Australia; however, the largest parcels of private funds 
invested in Australian-­registered companies came from London.9 There 
was an expectation that the mining sector could stimulate the Territories’ 
overall economic activity, thus making the development of other local 
industries easier.
By 1910 high-­grade alluvial mining at in Papua’s Milne Bay Province 
was undertaken by large teams of Papuans led by Europeans in an 
employer and labour relationship. Many prospectors came from the 
Eastern Australian goldfields of the 1850s, where the prospecting experi-
ence was quite different, as sites were initially worked by individuals or 
small partnerships, with finds divided among the members.10
For a short time prior to 1914, both the Administration and private 
entrepreneurs invested in mining in the Territory of Papua. The 
Administrative policy provided subsidies for prospecting expeditions, and 
some ­infrastructure continued to be fully financed.11
The economic growth of the Territories of Papua and New Guinea 
mainly relied on grants from the Australian Government, supplemented 
with local revenues.12 Beginning in 1920, Administrative policy and regu-
lations levied taxes and required mining licences; some of these revenues 
were applied towards the required infrastructure. By the 1930s mining 
of alluvial gold transitioned to mechanised dredging in Papua’s Morobe 
Province.13 One constant through the decades, was the clash between 
employers and labour over wages and conditions in the Papua goldfields. 
Accounts of Gold Dredging Limited’s treatment of its labourers in Bulolo 
detail violent encounters between miners and villagers.14 By this stage it 
was the corporations, with their mechanised, capital-­intensive techniques 
that mined in Papua territory. They were still mainly Australia-­based, 
(such as BHP Ltd and British New Guinea Syndicate Ltd), but financed

In 1911 the first reports of oil seepage emerged from Upoia, near the 
Gulf of Papua. The Australian Government allocated limited funds for 
follow up oil exploration, to no avail.17 After World War I the Australian 
Government undertook further exploration, this time sharing costs with 
the British Government. Together they financed the Anglo-­Persian Oil 
Company Ltd (now BP Ltd), which was appointed as the operator, but 
the British soon withdrew, due to divergent views, with the seed funding 
spent.
The Australian Government saw the Papua oilfields as potentially being 
of inestimable value for both commercial and defence purposes, and had 
no intention of allowing such a prospect to pass into private hands.18 At 
this time, distrust of oil companies was high. The Standard Oil monopoly 
in the United States had recently been broken up by judicial decree. In 
London, Churchill had attacked the Royal Dutch Shell Group over its 
attitude to pricing for Royal Navy contracts. A government monopoly was 
mandated for Papuan petroleum exploration, but by 1923 the Australian 
Government’s rising exploration expenses led to it granting leases to com-
panies such as the Papua Oil Exploratory Company Ltd, which failed 
to find viable prospects. In the late 1930s the Papua Oil Development 
Company, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell, was granted prospecting 
rights. Then British Petroleum, Vacuum Oil, and Oil Search formed Island 
Exploration Company Pty Ltd to undertake exploration. Later Oil Search 
linked with D’Arcy Exploration Company and Vacuum Oil to form 
Australasian Petroleum Co. Pty Ltd.

However by 1942 the Papua oilfields were found to lack prospectivity, 
and no alternative commercial hydrocarbon prospects had yet been found 
by the time the Pacific War interrupted the costly exploration activities.19
2.3  Commentary
Mining in the early colonial period of Papua New Guinea reflected the 
Administrative government’s encouragement of the minerals indus-
try in Papua to primarily benefit Australians and British rentiers. The 
Administration worked almost co-­operatively with miners to facilitate the 
extraction of mineral wealth. With financing mainly through equity, risk 
factors for mining companies were infrastructure construction and extrac-
tion costs. Payments such as royalties and compensation for land use were 
paid to host country landowners. There were no labour policies, and impacts 
on the environment (such as from dredging) were not addressed by policy. As 
for oil exploration, the Administrative government mandated a monopoly 
for strategic and political reasons, but allocated leases for private exploration 
and test drilling to contain costs. The key risk factor for oil companies, some 
of which were the precursors of today’s TNCs, were exploration costs.
3.  AFTER WORLD WAR II AND INDEPENDENCE
3.1  Oil and Gas
After World War II, oil exploration resumed, and in 1958 the Australasian 
Petroleum Company found a modest oil flow of 1,000 barrels a day at Puri 
in Western Papua. It is estimated that, up to 1958, costs for test drilling in 
the various parts of the Territory of Papua-­New Guinea were a staggering 
£31 million, which reflected the costs associated with such ventures in the 
steep and difficult terrain of PNG.20

In 1985 oil was discovered in the PNG’s southern highlands. The pros-
pect, known as the Kutubu project, was developed by a consortium led by 
a subsidiary of Chevron, a US company which had a 25 per cent holding; 
BP also had a 25 per cent share, with the balance of shares held by minor 
investors.21 In 1992 commercial production commenced, peaking in 1993. 
As of 2014, oil is still produced but the reserves are in decline. The major 
TNC shareholder is now Oil Search Ltd.
Proven gas reserves in the southern highlands are now the focus of 
hydrocarbon activity in PNG. In 2008 the tax arrangements for what is 
known as the PNG-­LNG project were settled, when the co-­venturers 
formally signed a Resource Development Agreement with the PNG 
Government. A Resource Development Agreement is confidential and 
overrides income tax and regulatory legislation. It establishes the fiscal 
regime and legal framework by which the project is regulated, and sets the 
terms for the state’s equity.22 The PNG Government’s equity share is at 
market value. In 2010 project construction commenced, with production 
starting on schedule in 2014.
3.2  Copper and Gold
Between 1972 and 1989 the bonanza prospect at the Panguna copper and 
gold mine on PNG’s Bougainville Island was operated by Bougainville 
Copper Ltd, which today is a subsidiary of the TNC Rio Tinto. The Ok 
Tedi prospect of copper and gold, located in the Western Province of 
Papua, commenced production in 1984 under the operator Broken Hill 
Proprietary Ltd, a TNC which is now BHP Billiton. Both prospects are 
massive low-­grade ore bodies that require highly mechanised, capital-­
intensive techniques.
There were a number of mining-­agreement negotiation challenges for 
the TNCs over these copper and gold mining projects in the 21-­month 
interval between PNG self-­government in 1973 and its independence in 
1975, as explained next.

3.3  Bougainville
Bougainville Copper Ltd financed the capital requirements for its copper 
and gold project from debt and equity, reflecting a 2:1 debt equity 
ratio. Borrowings were from the United States, Europe and Japan.23 In 
1967 while copper exploration was still in progress, the Administration 
re­negotiated the original Bougainville agreement, with its two objectives 
being to guarantee locally generated public revenue, and to stimulate 
the economy through export income.24 For the company, the new 1967 
agreement provided favourable tax concessions with a three-­year tax 
holiday, after which a 100 per cent deduction for capital expenditure 
applied – effectively extending the tax holiday to six or seven years – 
and an exemption from company tax on 20 per cent of all income from 
copper sales. The agreement included social provisions to employ PNG 
locals, and requirements for local services and supplies.25 To encourage 
the extraction of strategic metals, the agreement was not to be reviewed 
for another 42 years. However, just after the 1967 agreement, copper and 
gold prices rose, and the mine became highly profitable when production 
finally started in 1972. The poor tax take for PNG led to a UN report, 
which called for the Bougainville Copper Agreement’s fiscal provisions to 
be reviewed.
Political pressure and further mineral price rises led to renegotia-
tion, resulting in the 1974 Bougainville Copper Agreement. This 1974 
Agreement heralded a new era of partnership between government and 
private business. It immediately applied company tax at 33.3 per cent, 
removed accelerated depreciation, as well as the exemption from company 
tax on 20 per cent of sales income. There was also a resource rent tax 
introduced in the form of a progressive profits tax – the extra tax applying 
once profits exceeded the prescribed threshold rate. It was a way of com-
pensating the government for metal price rises above normal levels.26 Other 
new fiscal innovations included a 15 per cent withholding tax on outward

dividends and a 1.25 per cent ad valorem royalty. The royalty was compen-
sation paid by the company for the land occupied by the mine, destruction 
of livestock and gardens, destruction and detriment to fishing grounds, 
and the hardship created by enforced change, such as relocation of homes. 
However because of the indigenes’ unproductive use of the funds, the 
compensation monies had no multiplier effect on the economy.27 The PNG 
Government was allocated 20 per cent equity and paid at par value.
The Bougainville mine is potentially among the largest in the world; 
however troubles resulted from landowner dissatisfaction with environ-
mental impacts and the lack of local benefits, which had been eclipsed by 
the government’s pursuit of a national strategy.28 All early negotiations had 
been between the Administration and the company, not the local indigenes. 
Indigene dissatisfaction over the miner’s ravaging of the land arose from 
their local culture, which puts the highest importance on the land as the 
source of a material standard of life, security and the focus of religious 
attention. Disputes between Bougainville Copper and the villagers ensued. 
The land was the cornerstone of locals’ lives.29 Physical transformation of 
the land extended beyond the mining site to the Kawerong River valley 
where overburden and waste was dumped. Villages in the tailings area had 
to be relocated and fish life was disturbed.30
Ten years of civil war ended with military intervention in 1989 and the 
cessation of commercial operations. The mine is still idle. Thus for the 
TNC geological obstacles to the mining operations were minor compared 
with the environmental, political, social and cultural risks. Bougainville 
Copper sought to renew its production lease and reopen the mine, but in 
2014 the PNG parliament passed legislation that withdrew the company’s 
special lease for the Panguna mine.31 The mine re-­opening will be an under-
lying issue in the Bougainville islanders’ vote on independence in 2019.

at the confluence of the Ok Tedi and Ok Menga rivers, and traced it back 
to a copper reserve in the Mount Fulbian region in the Western Province 
of Papua. The copper reserve was recognised as a potentially major 
project and drilling tests were carried out from 1969 to 1971. Over two 
years (from 1970 to 1972) discussions ensued, with the company wanting 
a Special Mining Lease, a government contribution to infrastructure 
and government equity participation. Kennecott sought an agreement 
along the lines of the 1967 Bougainville Copper Agreement.32 Kennecott 
required a mining lease before more capital could be committed. From 
the Administrative-­government perspective, the project was inadequately 
defined in terms of the test drilling and metallurgical reports and so, with 
a lack of data, it was reluctant to commit to infrastructure in such a remote 
area. By 1973 Kennecott placed the ‘entire project on standby’,33 as it had 
failed to negotiate a mining lease, settle on likely government contributions 
to infrastructure, or a basis for government equity. It was also concerned 
about sovereign risk – as demonstrated by Chile’s 1971 expropriation 
of mining activities – and PNG’s shift towards self-­government in 1973 
meant there was pressure on the government not to overly concede fiscal 
­concessions for Ok Tedi.
During the PNG self-­government period, its parliament was required 
to articulate the principles that were to form the basis of a new minerals 
policy. These principles, reflecting strong nationalist sentiment, might be 
summarised as:
●
●
Mineral exploitation is desirable not for any benefits that it might 
provide directly, but for the financial resources it could provide 
for the development in other sectors, and for the sake of greater 
­independence from foreign aid;
●
●
The mineral resources of PNG belong to the country’s people, and 
the benefits of the exploitation of those resources must be made 
available to the people; and
●
●
Foreign investors are needed to provide the management skills and 
risk capital to exploit mineral resources, and it is understood that 
they expect to receive a reasonable return on their investment, but 
any profits in excess of a reasonable return should accrue to PNG 
as taxation.34

The PNG Government converted these principles into policy, confirm-
ing that an Ok Tedi agreement would require private projects to be self-­
supporting with regard to infrastructure and to provide an option for the 
government to purchase equity. The 1974 draft agreement with Kennecott 
included a corporate tax at 33.3 per cent, 1.25 per cent ad valorem royalty; 
and a 15 per cent withholding tax on outward dividends. There was also an 
innovative resource rent tax, called an additional profits tax (APT), to apply 
over a threshold rate, but what constituted a ‘reasonable rate of return’ for 
the threshold could not be agreed upon.35 Agreement over the choice of 
an independent party to adjudicate over disputes (for example, the Asian 
Development Bank) could not be resolved either, which ­foreshadowed a 
breakdown in contract negotiations.
Kennecott could not accede to the PNG Government’s mineral policy, 
and in 1975 the company withdrew from the negotiations over Ok 
Tedi. Negotiations then commenced with several international com­
panies, including BHP, which submitted a favourable proposal to the PNG 
Government, (after some persuasion by the Australian Government).36 In 
1976, after BHP finalized an acceptable full-­scale feasibility study, it signed 
an agreement with the new Independent State of Papua New Guinea. The 
1976 Ok Tedi Agreement represented a ‘practical compromise between gov-
ernment and investor’ that adhered to the host country’s minerals policy.37 
The government could opt to provide facilities such as ports, roads, water 
and power, but the cost had to be borne by the TNC, allowing it to have 
priority use over such infrastructure. Third parties could have access to 
facilities on a user pays basis. As the host country, PNG could take over the 
infrastructure, but the TNC had the right to the depreciation.38
The tax concessions given to BHP included accelerated depreciation, 
no withholding tax on interest payments for external loans, and no export 
levies or excise. There were social provisions that required the company to 
employ PNG nationals, and requirements to use local services and sup-
plies. There were provisions for an environmental management program 
and a 1.25 per cent ad valorem royalty. The PNG Government had the 
option of 20 per cent equity, either paid directly or through infrastructure;

there was no provision for compulsory acquisition or carried interest.39 An 
APT was designed and inserted into the agreement at an agreed threshold 
rate, and profits above it would trigger the APT. It is seen as a fair tax and 
meets the government’s minerals policy principles.40
Ok Tedi is PNG’s largest and longest operating mine and epitomises 
both the windfalls and challenges that mining brings to PNG. Social and 
environmental problems have plagued this mine and adversely affected 
PNG tax revenue. Tailings disposal by BHP during the 1980s and 1990s 
caused destruction of the Ok Tedi River ecology and thus impacted the 
livelihood of downstream villages.41 In 2002, BHP, then the major share-
holder and operator, divested its 63 per cent of Ok Tedi shares to a chari-
table trust, the PNG Sustainable Development Program (SDP) to help 
affected communities; the government owned 37 per cent of the shares. 
Remediation of the tailings-­polluted land and ecosystem is ongoing and 
costly.42 When BHP transferred its Ok Tedi shares to the SDP, the expecta-
tion was that the mine would close down within a relatively short time, but 
it has been kept in production.
After reviewing its fiscal regime, and in the wake of continuing low 
commodity prices, in 2003 the PNG Government introduced tax changes 
for the minerals sector, to encourage investment with minimal increases 
to taxes. Variations included changing income, royalty and withholding 
tax rates; introducing accelerated depreciation and double deductions for 
exploration; and abolishing the APT.43 However it would seem the conces-
sions were badly timed, for the mid-­2000s progressed to a resource boom 
and high prices, which made Ok Tedi profitable again.

3.5  Analysis
In the immediate post-­World War II period, exploration activities in PNG 
revealed proven and rich reserves of copper, along with its byproducts 
of gold and silver. At the time many developing countries, such as PNG, 
needed to attract external capital to build their infrastructure to extract 
minerals. Capital scarcity and a lack of local technical skills set the scene 
for competitive fiscal bidding, as was seen in the generous concessions 
in the 1967 Bougainville Copper Ltd Agreement. The Administration 
encouraged mining in pre-­independence PNG. This met a strategic need 
for certain metals and resulted in a greater reliance on internally generated 
revenues and also created economic stimulation through export income.
As the various Southeast Asian and Pacific Island possessions gradually 
gained their independence, nationalistic sentiment peaked and affected 
fiscal negotiations by post-­independence states, such as the adoption by 
Indonesia and Malaysia of oil production-­sharing agreements. Likewise, 
in the hubris of Papua New Guinea’s early independence days, its govern-
ment displayed an ambivalent attitude toward foreign investment. The 
PNG Government’s focused negotiations for the revised 1974 Bougainville 
Copper Agreement included provisions for an immediate imposition of 
income tax, a resource rent tax (the APT) – the first of its kind world-
wide – and reduced tax concessions for capital expenditure. Government 
equity was introduced, along with the requirement for local employment 
and training, and an allowance for flexible provisions for changing circum-
stances.44 The 1976 Ok Tedi Agreement was drafted using similar fiscal 
provisions.
After the first rush of nationalist sentiment following independence, the 
PNG Government’s attitude changed, and it began to see foreign invest-
ment as a necessary part of the mix for a stable economy. The govern-
ment’s stance against foreign investment reversed after the Bougainville 
copper mine closure in 1989, for this venture had made a 20 per cent con-
tribution to GDP.45
From a TNC perspective, the period from post-­World War II to inde-
pendence required changes in approach to the host country. Kennecott, 
the original Ok Tedi exploration company, was thwarted by its colonial 
mindset which intractably required a windfall return for its considerable 
risk, and it withdrew from the market. The successful replacement bidder, 
BHP, was more prepared to negotiate on fiscal issues. The BHP practical

compromise and final agreement came after a re-­examination of the avail-
able geological data.46 There was also a degree of acceptance that the old 
colonial order had changed and that this TNC was facing a strong and 
organised government negotiating team.47
Around the time of independence, sovereign risk became an issue for 
mining TNCs operating in PNG because of abrupt changes in the PNG 
government’s fiscal and economic policy, as well as the new role of local 
landowner negotiations.48 Other mining-­related risks included debt servic-
ing, Bougainville Copper, for instance, had an early A$250 million debt 
in 1972. The most significant operational risks were the environmental 
destruction caused by the BHP Ok Tedi tailings dam disaster of 1983–
1984, and the violent civil uprising in Bougainville that led to the mine’s 
closure in 1989.49
As for the oil industry in the post-­war period, the risk of high explora-
tion cost and low prospectivity continued. Security of operations became 
an issue, for example, in 1992 at the Kutubu oil project, central operations 
and infrastructure were enclosed in barbed wire compounds with 24-­hour 
policing.
In 2013 the Fraser Institute petroleum industry survey ranked PNG at 
a lowly 125 out of 157 host jurisdictions.50 It ranked PNG in the second-­
last quintile for regulatory risk (rule of law, environmental and labour 
regulations, transparency of legal system); and geopolitical risk (security 
of personnel and assets). However PNG was rated in the second quintile 
for industry’s perceptions of its likelihood of ‘transition to best practice.’ 
Other TNC extractive industry risks of the time included fluctuating cur-
rency exchange rates; the future of Australian grants and aid to PNG; and 
the rate of domestic inflation in PNG.51

4.  RECENT LESSONS
By mid-­2014 PNG was host to eight large operating mines (extracting 
copper, gold and silver), mostly operated by TNCs, as shown in Table 13.1.
In 2012 PNG’s Lihir mine, one of the world’s largest known gold depos-
its, suspended operations briefly due to traditional landowner protests over 
inadequate benefits for Lihir Island indigenes. That same year, the Ramu 
nickel mine (in PNG’s Madang province) faced ongoing court challenges 
by landowners over the practice of submarine tailings disposal.52
In 2013 Ok Tedi was nationalized when the PNG government cancelled 
the 63 per cent of Ok Tedi Mining shares that were previously owned by 
the SDP trust.53 The PNG Government now owns all the Ok Tedi shares. 
The rushed passage of the legislation for the mine’s nationalisation is seen 
as poor government minerals policy.54 Nonetheless, as of 2014 Ok Tedi is 
PNG’s largest mine and revenue earner.55
At Newcrest’s Hidden Valley gold mine in Morobe province, social issues 
were raised again in March 2014, when workers’ protests for better working

conditions resulted in suspended production. It can be seen that – even after 
the civil uprising and military intervention in Bougainville, and the environ-
mental concerns from the tailings pollution of the Ok Tedi river system – the 
same TNC mining risks, concerning landowner compensation, labour rela-
tions and environmental degradation, continue. The question of whether the 
2014 commissioning of the liquefied natural gas venture (the LNG-­PNG 
project) will reflect a reversal for TNCs’ extraction activity risk in PNG, 
along with improved fiscal results for the host country, is covered in Section 6.
5.  INSTITUTIONAL INTEREST IN HOST 
COUNTRIES
Institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, international 
financial bodies, the global Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative 
and the Natural Resource Governance Institute exercise varying degree 
of influence in host countries that are classified as developing, as further 
discussed below.
5.1  International Monetary Fund
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is a powerful institution 
which is enabled by wealthy subscriber governments to influence the 
economic policy of middle and low income countries. Its programs are 
about facilitating a liberal economic order in host countries. Criticisms 
of the IMF include promotion of subscriber governments’ interests over 
those of targeted host countries; weak accountability within the IMF 
for its promoted programs; and inherent weaknesses in the discipline of 
economics and its methods for achieving improvements in host country 
governance.56 Clements claims that IMF staff typically arrive at a host 
country ‘with a standard template, insensitive to variations in economic 
conditions and political constraints’.57 A country that joins the IMF 
must accept the principles and rules informed by free-­market economics, 
which, according to Clements, are not varied enough to suit country-­
specific characteristics.

back to at least 1989.58 After the Bougainville mine closure, the late 
1990s saw PNG’s economy suffer large, adverse shocks related to a severe 
drought, the Asian economic crisis and falling export prices for copper 
and gold. Tax revenue fell by 4.5 per cent of GDP in 1998, led by large and 
natural declines in the petroleum sector. Despite cuts in capital spending 
and an increase in external grants, the PNG fiscal position shifted from 
near balance in 1997 to an overall deficit. The government deficit was 
financed mainly by recourse to central bank financing. The annual rate of 
inflation rose to around 20 per cent at the end of 1998 and early 1999. This 
fiscal deterioration in PNG prompted IMF intervention in March 2000 
through the provision of a US$115 million standby credit facility.59 The 
PNG government’s associated letter of intent describes its economic poli-
cies for immediate implementation in the context of this financial support 
from the IMF.60 Under Article IV of the IMF Articles of Agreement, each 
year bilateral discussions are required with members that receive financial 
assistance. PNG must submit a country report which covers key issues 
relating to economic stability; for example, policies and legislation for 
the sound fiscal management of resource extraction. This in turn impacts 
TNCs operating in PNG’s extractive industry.
The IMF annual report includes commentary on the host country’s 
general economic outlook and risks to economic growth, and the IMF’s 
assessment of a host country’s policies; for example resource revenue man-
agement, monetary and exchange rate macroeconomic policies, financial 
stability and associated structural reforms.61 An adverse IMF report com-
mentary can affect a host country’s credit rating.
Scrutiny of PNG’s economic policies by the IMF can be seen in the 
country reports from 2003 to the present.62 Prior to these finance-­triggered 
country reports, the IMF had been compiling background issues papers 
and statistics on PNG, most likely because of the country’s strategic 
natural resources.

5.2  International Financial Institutions
The World Bank is an institution allied with the objectives of the IMF. The 
World Bank is one of a range of international financial institutions (IFIs) 
that typically provide long-­term development loans to host countries at 
terms lower than private market rates. In the 1960s, the World Bank rec-
ommended fiscal adjustments to promote PNG’s agriculture and forestry 
exports, but it excluded consideration of the social consequences for the 
indigenes living in the local area.63 Another class of international financial 
institution is the multilateral development bank (MDB) that is based on 
the World Bank model. The funds for MDB loans come from wealthy 
governments, which can influence lending policy. Whereas the IMF might 
provide interim funds, MDB loans to host countries may be long term, and 
normally provided because of a host county’s lack of foreign exchange. 
Most MDB loans are for a specific project that fits long-­term economic 
policy objectives. In some cases MDBs have requested host countries to 
introduce free market reforms, called structural adjustment programs.64
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was established in 1964 and 
focuses on Asia and the Pacific. This MDB uses policy dialogue, loans, 
equity investments, grants and technical assistance to help developing host 
countries.65 Papua New Guinea has been a member of the ADB since 1971 
and has received loans on several occasions. For instance, it has sought 
funds for technical assistance to find new ways for the hydrocarbons sector 
to deal with landowner issues.66 In 2010 PNG agreed on a new ‘country 
partnership strategy’ with the ADB. The strategy prioritises transport 
infrastructure and private sector development, which may affect TNCs in 
the petroleum and mining sectors. Under an ADB grant for PNG health 
and social protection initiatives, a TNC subsidiary, Oil Search (PNG) Ltd, 
was contracted for its expertise in its locale of operations.67

5.3  The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
From 2002 world mineral prices rapidly increased, driven by the demand 
for raw materials from China and other emerging economies. However 
many resource-­rich but developing economies were still in poverty, despite 
the consistently strong demand for their natural resources. The Extractive 
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) was launched in 2002 to fight 
corruption, a primary cause of misallocation of tax revenue in host coun-
tries. One aim is to reduce opportunities for corruption by improving 
governance over company reporting of extractive industry revenues and 
government recording of tax expenditure. The EITI is a global co­alition 
of governments, companies and civil society that work together to improve 
openness and accountable management of revenues from natural resources. 
All three sectors nominate representatives to a ‘multi-­stakeholder group’ 
for a member country. The EITI’s project finances come from donor coun-
tries that deposit monies into a trust fund managed by the World Bank. 
The trust monies are used for technical and financial assistance for EITI 
member countries.68 There are currently 46 countries that are either EITI 
compliant or undertaking candidature.69 
Papua New Guinea was admitted as an EITI candidate country in 
March 2014 and its multi-­stakeholder group published its first activity 
report in 2015.70 According to the EITI standard, which is the authorita-
tive source on how countries might implement the initiative, the purpose 
of the first EITI Report is for citizens to trace the value of their coun-
try’s natural resources from production all the way into the government’s 
national accounts.71 Validation of the PNG EITI Report will start within 
three years (2017) and requires an external, independent evaluation 
mechanism, undertaken by an accredited validator procured by the EITI 
International Secretariat.

5.4  Natural Resource Governance Institute
The Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI) aims to facilitate the 
benefits of a country’s endowments of oil, gas and minerals to a host coun-
try’s constituents. Its work is funded by philanthropic organizations and 
wealthy national governments. The NRGI uses technical advice, advocacy, 
applied research, policy analysis, and capacity development to achieve its 
goals. The NRGI is underpinned by its Natural Resource Charter, which 
is concerned with applying initiatives such as the Resource Governance 
Index.
The Natural Resource Charter is a set of principles to guide govern-
ments and societies in their use of natural resources in achieving sustained 
returns for their country’s citizens.72 The Charter’s 12 principles cover 
domestic foundations for resource governance, exploration and licence 
allocation, taxation, revenue volatility and distribution; sustainability for 
both government and the private sector; and the role of TNCs. Charter 
expectations of the TNC role go beyond profits and obligations to share-
holders, to include economic, environmental and social standards. The 
Resource Governance Index measures the quality of governance in the oil, 
gas and mining sector for 58 countries.73
In the 2013 Resource Governance Index, PNG received a ‘weak’ score of 
43, ranking 39th. A low score is interpreted as a reflection of critical gaps 
in government management across most aspects of the extractive industry 
sector, including its institutional and legal setting, reporting practices, safe-
guards and quality controls, and providing an enabling environment. The 
troubled history of the PNG mining industry, illustrated by the Ok Tedi 
and Bougainville mining operations and decades of poor management, 
has led to severe environmental damage and social upheaval. As a result of 
PNG’s 2014 acceptance as an EITI candidate with its corresponding mem-
bership requirements, and its first report submitted in 2015, an improve-
ment is expected in its Resource Governance Index score in the future.

NRGI initiatives as unwelcome interventions that cannot be uncoupled 
from financial aid. The lack of finesse in economic methodologies, and low 
institutional empathy – both perceived and real – for cultural and social dif-
ferences between target countries have given rise to criticisms. Time will tell 
whether these institutions have raised the economic scorecard of PNG’s 
new liquefied natural gas (LNG) project over its expected operational life 
of 20 years.74
6.  THE LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS PROJECT
The development of natural gas reserves in PNG’s Southern Highlands 
and Western Province gas fields has captured the attention of the interna-
tional petroleum and gas industry. There are now over 70 live petroleum 
prospecting licences covering most prospective areas in PNG.75 Production 
of natural gas for the PNG-­LNG project began in 2014. It involves the 
extraction and processing of gas through a conditioning plant, then trans-
mission by pipeline to a liquefaction plant at Port Moresby for export as 
liquefied natural gas (LNG). The initial success to date of the PNG-­LNG 
project encouraged further exploration for natural gas reserves.76 However 
the rapid drop in prices since mid-­2014, has impacted the profitability of 
the project. The project co-­venture partners are Esso Highlands Ltd (a 
subsidiary of ExxonMobil), Oil Search Ltd, Santos Ltd and JX Nippon 
Oil and Gas Exploration. These entities, which are all TNCs, hold 80 per 
cent of the equity in the project.77
6.1  Risk Analysis
From a TNC risk perspective, PNG’s natural gas sector has good resource 
prospectivity and acceptable debt-­to-­equity ratio legislation.78 The inflow

from foreign investors has been strong, as evidenced by the application 
of US$20 billion to construction costs for the project.79 The risk concern-
ing clarity on rule of law, which is aligned with free markets and trade, is 
important to TNCs, and while a standard resource development agreement 
comes under PNG jurisdiction, it overrides legislation affecting natural 
resources – which may affect potential investor interest.80 Questions also 
arise about whether the success of the PNG-­LNG project reflects other risk 
mitigation initiatives, such as social and environment issues, or changes in 
regulatory controls. Current PNG social issues are unchanged and include 
those of indigene resettlement, claims for compensation and mineral royal-
ties, and security of project personnel. Unemployment has grown due to 
redundancies linked to the completion of the PNG-­LNG construction 
phase, compounding other social issues.81 Hydrocarbon TNCs have some 
environmental programs that cover flora and fauna, reflecting the lower 
risk compared with the mining industry.82 The Oil and Gas Act of 1998 
(PNG), which regulates the industry, has not been amended since 2006; 
from a TNC perspective this stability is considered as ‘low’ regulatory risk.
In the period leading up to the 2014 export of LNG, there was an exter-
nal institutional push on the PNG Government to apply the LNG project 
proceeds to a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) to stabilize the local currency 
and to pay for much-­needed development infrastructure. However, and 
quite unexpectedly, the PNG Government made arrangements to apply its 
future receipts from the LNG project to repay a loan for the purchase of 
shares in Oil Search Ltd.83 The SWF was finally established in July 2015, 
and the National Budget 2016 noted the expectation that revenues will be 
paid into the SWF in 2016.
PNG Government shareholding in extractive industry projects goes 
back to 1974 when the Bougainville Copper Agreement provided for 
government equity at 20 per cent par value. This gave the aspirant state a 
sense of participating in its mineral sector. In 2013 the PNG Government

legislated for its 100 per cent equity interest the Ok Tedi copper mine, a 
rushed exercise that caused consternation. As for the PNG-­LNG project, 
the PNG state venture partners borrowed funds to gain a direct interest of 
19.6 per cent. The PNG wholly owned National Petroleum Company of 
PNG then borrowed AU$1.2 billion under a commercial arrangement to 
pay for 10 per cent of Oil Search shares.
There are a range of concerns about government equity in commercial 
projects generally. Such equity requires a diversion of public funds from 
social and public infrastructure, health and education projects. A develop-
ing host government may not possess the high level of technical expertise 
required for ongoing monitoring of the investment. Conflicts of inter-
est arise with the government being both regulator and promoter of an 
industry. Equity holdings expose the government to risk, a vital issue for 
developing-­country host governments with limited funds.
From the TNC perspective, the fact that a government can hold options 
for equity over a long period could be seen as an unfair advantage over 
potential private shareholders and can reduce the incentive to invest.84 A 
PNG resource development agreement may include a government equity 
option to be exercised at full market value or at a discount. If the latter, 
then a TNC must look to negotiate tax concessions to cover the sunk costs 
of exploration, and the uncertainty of such an option poses yet another 
risk. The PNG Government has not contributed to exploration costs in the 
PNG-­LNG project. TNCs have shown a preference for host country gov-
ernments having equity participation on ‘commercial terms’ rather than a 
‘carried interest’, as the latter negatively affects the attractiveness of a host 
country as an investment destination.
7.  TAX REFORM IN PNG
In any country, tax reform is generally claimed by investors to be a poten-
tial ‘sovereign risk’. In 2013 the PNG Government announced its com-
mitment to a fiscal review including petroleum, gas and mining taxation 
reform options. A Taxation Review Committee was established and its first 
initiative was a general public or ‘Blue Sky’ consultation process, whereby 
institutions, investors and community stakeholders were invited to for-
mally submit their perspectives on broad directions for reform and key pri-
ority areas. Public forums included a National Research Institute of Papua

New Guinea-­sponsored ‘Taxation Research and Review Symposium’ in 
May 2014.85 The second stage, also in 2014, involved the Taxation Review 
Committee’s issuing papers on specific taxation areas to promote more tar-
geted discussion and debate, such as their mining and petroleum studies.86 
For example, ExxonMobil submitted a response with a strong call for ‘no 
change’ to the existing PNG-­LNG fiscal arrangements.87
The third tax reform stage included further debate in areas such as 
state equity participation in mining and petroleum projects, and property 
taxation. The Taxation Review Committee presented its Final Report in 
October 2015 to the PNG Government. The report drew on all stages 
of the review and under consideration by the Government for action 
in 2016. The Taxation Review’s Final Report was noted in the National 
Budget 2016. The outcome of the PNG tax review was closely followed by 
stakeholders, with the consultation process seen to display all the elements 
of reasonable stakeholder engagement. Unless there are major retrospec-
tive changes in the fiscal regime, the issue of sovereign risk from a TNC 
perspective is unlikely. The unforeseen fall in prices is the key risk being 
addressed.
Given PNG’s past record of poor fiscal outcomes and operational dis-
asters from copper and gold mining,88 the question arises about whether 
tax reform will improve PNG tax revenues – in the currently difficult time 
of low commodity prices. The commonly used measure of ‘tax effort’, 
the difference between predicted and actual tax take, should be given 
consideration.89 In any country revenue performance can be improved by 
a few percentage points of GDP, and it would seem that sufficient institu-
tional support for PNG is in place to progress tax reform and governance 
initiatives.90

8.  CONCLUSION
In colonial times, risk factors for mining companies included infrastruc-
ture construction and extraction costs, with financing mainly through 
equity. The key risk factor for oil companies, some of which were the 
­precursors to today’s TNCs, was the cost of exploration
In the post-­World War II period, the mining industry required inten-
sive extraction techniques, and capital scarcity set the scene for Southeast 
Asian and Pacific Island nations’ competitive fiscal bidding, a conse-
quence of which was the generous concessions for PNG copper mining 
made in 1967. Nationalistic sentiment peaked and affected fiscal nego-
tiations by many post-­independence states. In the hubris of PNG’s early 
independence, the government displayed an ambivalent attitude toward 
foreign investment. For the new 1974 Bougainville Copper Agreement, 
the government’s focused negotiations included provisions for an immedi-
ate imposition of income tax, a unique resource rent tax (the APT) and 
reduced tax concessions for capital expenditure. Government equity was 
introduced along with the requirement of local employment and training 
and for flexibility in provisions, to allow for changing circumstances. The 
1976 Ok Tedi Agreement was cast with similar fiscal provisions. The PNG 
Government attitude changed after the 1989 events on Bougainville, and it 
began to be more accommodating toward foreign investment and to accept 
their ­presence as a necessary part of a stabilized economy.
From a TNC perspective, PNG independence required a new approach 
to the host country. The old colonial mindset demanded a high return for 
the miners’ considerable risk. As illustrated in the finalization of the 1976 
Ok Tedi agreement, the winning bidder had to be more prepared to nego-
tiate on fiscal issues. Thus, around the independence period, as a conse-
quence of abrupt and ‘aggressive’ changes in PNG governmental fiscal and 
economic policy, sovereign risk became an issue for mining TNCs operat-
ing in PNG. Other mining risks of the time included debt servicing, such as 
Bougainville Copper’s early A$250 million debt. A most significant opera-
tional risk was the remediation required for the environmental destruction 
caused by BHP’s Ok Tedi mining activities and the social backlash that led 
to the Bougainville mine closure in 1989.
As for the oil industry, the immediate post-­World War II period saw 
continued risk in terms of high exploration cost and low prospectivity. In 
1992 oil was finally produced from the Kutubu oil project, and security of 
operations became a key risk issue.
The newest LNG project indicates that PNG’s natural gas has good 
resource prospectivity and acceptable debt-­to-­equity ratio legislative 
requirements. Risks connected to PNG social issues are unchanged and

388    Research handbook on transnational corporations
include those of indigene resettlement, claims for both compensation and 
mineral royalties, post-­construction unemployment and the security of 
project personnel. Government equity in commercial projects remains con-
troversial. TNCs tend to prefer government equity participation on ‘com-
mercial terms’ rather than a ‘carried interest’. For now, price has emerged 
as the key risk.
Developing countries quite rightly assert their sovereign status and may 
look upon the institutional initiatives from the IMF, MDBs, the EITI and 
the NRGI as unwelcome interventions. The lack of finesse in economic 
methodologies, and the low institutional empathy for cultural and social 
differences between target countries, have both given rise to criticism. 
These institutions share the common economic goal of improved revenue 
performance by target countries. PNG’s tax reform process has had rea-
sonably conservative aims and, as yet, no adverse reports of TNC concerns 
about sovereign risk.
The extractive industry is cyclical, with prices rising and falling accord-
ing to demand and supply. Prospectivity for natural resources is gener-
ally uncertain, and exploration costs can be high, varying between the 
hydrocarbon and mining industries. There are many inherent risks for 
TNCs in the extractive industry, including price, fiscal regime, sovereign 
risk, concerns with legislated debt-­to-­equity ratios, security of operations, 
issues surrounding corruption, environmental and social concerns, infra-
structure, rule of law and labour. Although this chapter focused upon the 
specific TNC experiences in PNG, it is also provides insights for TNCs 
operating in countries with a similar economic profile and lessons for other 
extractive industry TNCs, and developing-­country host governments.
