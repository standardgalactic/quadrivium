LAY CARPET, VINYL OR 
CORK TILES  
 
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
Only simple skills are needed to lay carpet, vinyl or cork 
tiles. Even where tiles have to be cut to fit awkward shapes, 
a simple cardboard pattern can be made first as a guide. 
  
 
 
If adhesive has to be used to stick down tiles, ensure there 
is adequate ventilation in the room. When cutting tiles, use a
sharp knife fitted with the correct blade for the material 
being laid. 
  
 
 
Floor tiles are very versatile - they can be used in any room 
in the house and make an excellent, hard wearing 
floorcovering. 
  
Buy good-quality tiles and you will have a floorcovering that 
will withstand wear, tear and spillages. The beauty of carpet 
tiles is that if one is damaged or stained beyond repair, it 
can simply be picked up and replaced. 
  
The performance of any floorcovering is determined by the 
care taken to prepare the sub-floor. Whether timber or 
concrete, it should be dry, clean and even. Where necessary,
the sub-floor should be covered with hardboard. 
 
2  - Calculating tiles needed 
Tiles are sold in packs and the size and number of tiles 
contained in the pack will determine the area of floor that 
they will cover - usually stated in both metric and imperial 
measurements. If the area is given only in metric, then 
measure the room in metric or errors could occur in your 
calculations.  
 
 
 
Measure the room and multiply the width by the length to 
find its total area. Any reveal or bay should be measured 
separately and its total area added to the main floor area. 
Round up the total to the nearest whole number to establish 
the number of packs of tiles you need to buy.  
 
3  - Sub-floor preparation 

If you have chipboard floors 
which are smooth and level, 
you can lay tiles directly on 
top. Remove any protruding 
tacks or nails or drive their 
heads below the surface 
using a hammer and nail 
punch (1); drive any screws 
just below the surface. Any 
loose boards should be 
refixed - use screws in 
upstairs rooms as h
could damage the ceiling 
below.

Make sure that there are no wires or plumbing pipes where 
you are driving in nails or screws. 
 
 
 
Floorboards will need to be covered with sheets of 3mm 
thick hardboard. If you lay tiles directly on to floorboards, it 
is likely that the boards will start to show through and cause 
premature wear, especially in areas of heavy traffic.  
 
 
 
Use sheets 1220mm (4ft) square, or 1220mm x 610mm (4ft 
x 2ft).  
 
 
 
Condition the boards to the room's atmosphere before laying
them. This prevents them warping later. Brush water on to 
the mesh-side of the board, then stack the boards for 48 
hours, mesh-side to mesh-side, in the room in which they 
are to be used. 
 
 
 
Lay the boards smooth-side 
up. Use 19mm annular nails, 
hardboard nails or staples. 
Fix them every 150mm 
around the edges and across 
the boards. Butt up the e
of adjoining boards tightly, 
and stagger them in 
brickwork fashion so that 
joints don't coincide (2).  
 
 
 
When cutting boards at skirtings, you do not need to get a 
perfect fit - a gap of around 6mm will be covered by the tile. 
 
 

 
Any dampness in a solid floor must be treated before laying 
a floorcovering. There are various damp-proofing 
compounds that can be brushed on to cure the problem. 
 
 
 
Holes or uneven patches can 
be filled with a self-levelling 
compound which is poured on 
the floor and spread out with
a trowel (3 & 4). It will then 
set to a level finish.  
 
A concrete floor which gives 
off dust when brushed can 
be treated with a purpose-
made sealer or with diluted 
PVA adhesive. 
 
A new concrete floor must 
be allowed to dry out befo
laying tiles. Allow about one 
thickness.

have arrows on the back, 
which show the direction in
