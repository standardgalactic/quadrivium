“Eric Tyson is doing something important — namely, helping people at all
income levels to take control of their financial futures. This book is a nat-
ural outgrowth of Tyson’s vision that he has nurtured for years. Like
Henry Ford, he wants to make something that was previously accessible
only to the wealthy accessible to middle-income Americans.”
— James C. Collins, coauthor of the national bestsellers
Built to Last and Good to Great
“The organization of this book is superb! I could go right to the topics of
immediate interest and find clearly written and informative material.”
— Lorraine Verboort, Beaverton, OR

“Smart advice for dummies . . . skip the tomes . . . and buy Personal Finance
For Dummies, which rewards your candor with advice and comfort.”

“You don’t have to be a novice to like Mutual Funds For Dummies. Despite
the book’s chatty, informal style, author Eric Tyson clearly has a mastery
of his subject. He knows mutual funds, and he knows how to explain
them in simple English.”
— Steven T. Goldberg, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance
Magazine
“Eric Tyson . . . seems the perfect writer for a ...For Dummies book. He
doesn’t tell you what to do or consider doing without explaining the why’s
and how’s — and the booby traps to avoid — in plain English. . . . It will
lead you through the thickets of your own finances as painlessly as I can
imagine.”
— Clarence Peterson, Chicago Tribune
“Personal Finance For Dummies is the perfect book for people who feel guilty
about inadequately managing their money but are intimidated by all of the
publications out there. It’s a painless way to learn how to take control.”
— Karen Tofte, producer, National Public Radio’s Sound
Money

About the Author
Eric Tyson is an internationally acclaimed and best-selling personal finance
author, lecturer, and advisor. Through his work, he is dedicated to teaching
people to manage their money better and to successfully direct their own
investments. 
Eric is a former management consultant to businesses for which he helped
improve operations and profitability. Before, during, and after this time of
working crazy hours and traveling too much, he had the good sense to focus
on financial matters.
He has been involved in the investing markets in many capacities for more
than three decades. Eric first invested in mutual funds back in the mid-1970s,
when he opened a mutual fund account at Fidelity. With the assistance of Dr.
Martin Zweig, a now-famous investment market analyst, Eric won his high
school’s science fair in 1976 for a project on what influences the stock
market. In addition to investing in securities over recent decades, Eric has
also successfully invested in real estate and started and managed his own
business. He has counseled thousands of clients on a variety of investment
quandaries and questions.
He earned a bachelor’s degree in economics at Yale and an M.B.A. at the
Stanford Graduate School of Business. Despite these impediments to lucid rea-
soning, he came to his senses and decided that life was too short to spend it
working long hours and waiting in airports for the benefit of larger companies.
An accomplished freelance personal finance writer, Eric is the author of
numerous best-selling books including For Dummies books on Personal
Finance, Mutual Funds, Real Estate Investing (co-author), Taxes (co-author)
and Home Buying (co-author) and is a syndicated columnist. His work has
been featured and quoted in hundreds of national and local publications,
including Newsweek, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Magazine, Los Angeles
Times, Chicago Tribune, The Wall Street Journal, and Bottom Line/Personal,
and on NBC’s Today Show, ABC, CNBC, PBS’s Nightly Business Report, CNN,
CBS national radio, Bloomberg Business Radio, National Public Radio, and
Business Radio Network. He’s also been a featured speaker at a White House
conference on retirement planning.
To stay in tune with what real people care about and struggle with, Eric still
maintains a financial counseling practice.


Dedication
This book is hereby and irrevocably dedicated to my family and friends, as
well as to my counseling clients and customers, who ultimately have taught
me everything that I know about how to explain financial terms and strate-
gies so that all of us may benefit.

Introduction
T
he decade since the first edition of this book was published has wit-
nessed both increased interest in and media coverage of the investment
world. The Internet has established itself as a fixture within the home and
office, along with all the investment-related stories, facts, figures, applica-
tions, and scams that reside there. You can’t flip through the channels on
your television without running into a stock ticker at the bottom of your
screen or a pitchman claiming that folks are just waiting to pay you to buy
their property. And new books are published every day that claim to posses
the secret to investing success. With all this attention, you may think that
investing times have changed. But to a large degree, things haven’t changed
all that much. Investments that were considered lousy years ago — products
with high fees and commission — generally are still lousy today.
The best investment vehicles for building wealth — stocks, real estate, and
small business — haven’t changed either. And you still need money to play in
the investment world. Like the first edition of Investing For Dummies, the
fourth edition of this national best-seller includes complete coverage of these
wealth-building investments as well as other common investments, such as
bonds. Here are the biggest changes in this edition:
 Completely revised and updated: I’ve freshened up the data and 
examples in this book to provide you the latest insights and analyses.
Wondering whether there’s a way to invest in stocks without exposing
yourself to tremendous risk? Wondering what an exchange traded fund
or hedge fund is and whether you should invest? Considering whether
it’s too late to invest in real estate or asking yourself what the heck a
REIT is? Having trouble making sense of various economic indicators
and what they mean to your investment strategy? Confused about how
recent tax law changes should affect your investment strategies? Curious
how private Social Security investment accounts would work? You can
find the answers to these questions and many more in this edition.
 Investing resources section: With the continued growth in Web sites,
software, publications, media outlets, and many other information
sources offering investing advice and information, you’re probably over-
whelmed about how to choose among the numerous investing research
tools and resources. Equally problematic is knowing whom you can trust
and listen to — and whom you need to ignore. I explain how to evaluate
the quality of current investment tools and resources, and I provide tips
for whom to listen to and whom to tune out.

How Savvy Investors Build Wealth
As a financial counselor, I know from working with people of modest and
immodest economic means that the time-tested ways that they increase their
wealth are by doing the following:
 Living within their means and systematically saving and investing
money, ideally in a tax-favored manner
 Buying and holding a diversified portfolio of stocks
 Building their own small business or career
 Investing in real estate
That kind of investing is what this book is all about. Equally, if not more,
important, I help you understand and choose investments compatible with
your personal and financial goals.
You don’t need a fancy college or graduate-school degree, and you don’t need
a rich dad or mom, biological or adopted! What you do need is a desire to read
and practice the many simple yet powerful lessons and strategies in this book.
Seriously, investing intelligently isn’t rocket science. You see, I wrote this
book hoping that you can gather enough information in these subject areas
so that you don’t need to hire people like me. By all means, if you’re dealing
with a complicated, atypical issue, get quality professional help. But educate
yourself first. Hiring someone is dangerous if you yourself are financially chal-
lenged. If you do finally decide to hire someone, you’ll be much better pre-
pared by educating yourself, and you’ll be more focused in your questions
and better able to assess that person’s competence.
Foolish Assumptions
Every book is written with a certain reader in mind, and this book is no 
different:
 You may have a few investments, but you’re looking to develop a full-
scale investment plan.
 You’d like to strengthen your portfolio.
 You want to evaluate your investment advisor’s advice.
 You have a company-sponsored investment plan, like a 401(k), and
you’re looking to make some decisions or roll it over into a new plan. 
If one or more of these descriptions sound familiar, you’ve come to the right
place.

How This Book Is Organized
This book helps you fill gaps in your investment knowledge. It’s structured so
that you can read it cover to cover or simply dive into particular sections
that most interest you. Here are the major parts.
Part I: Investing Fundamentals
Before you can confidently and intelligently choose investments, you need to
be able to cut through the lingo and jargon to get to the heart of what invest-
ments are and are not, and how they differ from one another. In this part, I
explain what rate of return you can reasonably expect to earn and how much
risk you need to take to get it. This part also details how investments best fit
your specific financial goals and situation.
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street
I know that you probably don’t want to trade in your day job for one where
you’d wear a three-piece suit and need to know on which page of the daily
Wall Street Journal you can find yield curves. But you do need to understand
what the financial markets are and how you can participate in them without
suffering too many abrasions and lacerations. I explain what stocks and
bonds are all about and how to best buy them and build your future fortune.
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate
We all need places to live, work, and shop, so it makes sense that real estate
can be a profitable part of your investment portfolio. Intelligently buying and
managing real estate is harder than it looks, which is why this part covers lots
of territory. I show you the best ways to invest in real estate and provide a crash
course in mortgages, landlording, buying low, selling high, taxes, and more.
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
There’s nothing small about the potential profits you can make from small
business. You can choose the small business investment option that matches
your skills and time. If you aspire to be the best boss you’ve ever had, here
you can find the right ways to start your own business or buy someone else’s
small business. Or maybe you’d like to try your hand at spotting up-and-comers
but don’t want to be on the front lines — try investing in someone else’s
small business.

Introduction

Part V: Investing Resources
Flip through your cable television channels, crack open a magazine or news-
paper, or go Web-site surfing, and you quickly discover that you can’t escape
investment advice. Surprisingly, each new guru you stumble upon contra-
dicts the one who came before. Before you know it, although you’ve spent an
avalanche of your valuable free time on all this investment stuff, you’re no
closer to making an informed decision. In fact, if you’re like most people, you
find yourself even more confused and paralyzed. Fear not! In this important
part, I explain why many experts really aren’t experts and why most of them
try to make the world of investing so mysterious. I highlight the best
resources to use and experts worth listening to.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
These shorter chapters build your investment knowledge further. You find
advice about topics such as overcoming common psychological investment
obstacles, tips for investing in a down market, and points to ponder when
you sell an investment. I also explain some important economic indicators.
If you’re the kind of reader who jumps around from topic to topic instead of
reading from cover to cover, you’ll be pleased that this book has a helpful
index and that it highlights the pages where investing terms are defined.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, icons help guide you through the maze of suggestions,
solutions, and cautions. I hope you find that the following images make your
journey through investment strategies smoother.
In the shark-infested investing waters, you’ll find creatures that feast on novice
waders, ready to take a bite out of a swimmer’s savings. This icon notes when
and where the sharks may be circling.
If you see this icon, I’m pointing out companies, products, services, and
resources that have proved to be exceptional over the years — in other
words, resources that I would or do use personally or would recommend to
my friends and family.
4
Investing For Dummies, 4th Edition 

I use this icon to highlight an issue that requires more detective work on your
part. Don’t worry, though; I prepare you for your work so that you don’t have
to start out as a novice gumshoe.
I think the name says it all, but this icon indicates something really, really
important — don’t you forget it!
Skip it or read it; the choice is yours. You’ll fill your head with more stuff that
may prove valuable as you expand your investing know-how, but you risk
overdosing on stuff that you may not need right away.
This icon denotes strategies that can enable you to build wealth faster and
leap over tall obstacles in a single bound.
This icon indicates treacherous territory that has made mincemeat out of
lesser mortals who have come before you. Skip this point at your own peril.
Where to Go from Here
If you have the time and desire, I encourage you to read this book in its
entirety. It provides you with a detailed picture of how to maximize your
returns while minimizing your risks through wealth-building investments. But
you don’t have to read this book cover to cover. If you have a specific ques-
tion or two that you want to focus on today, or you want to find some addi-
tional information tomorrow, it’s not a problem. Investing For Dummies, 4th
Edition, makes it easy to find answers to specific questions. Just turn to the
table of contents or the index to locate the information you need. You can get
in and get out, just like that.

f you succeed in accumulating some money to invest, congratulations!
You’ve accomplished a feat that the majority of people in the world
haven’t yet done. If you decide to move to the next step — actually investing
some of that money — you’ve come to the right place. Investing For Dummies,
4th Edition, is your one-stop investment reference guide and counselor, ready
to prepare you for the thrilling and rewarding world of investing.
In many parts of the world, life’s basic necessities — food, clothing, shelter,
and taxes — gobble the entirety of people’s meager earnings. Although some
Americans do struggle for basic necessities, the bigger problem for most
Americans is that they consider just about everything — eating out, driving new
cars, hopping on an airplane for vacation — to be a necessity. I’ve taken it upon
myself (using this book as my tool) to help you recognize that investing —
that is, putting your money to work for you — is also a necessity. If you want
to accomplish important personal and financial goals, such as owning a
home, starting your own business, helping your kids through college (and
spending more time with them when they’re young), retiring, and so on, you
must know how to invest well.
It has been said, and too often quoted, that the only certainties in life are
death and taxes. To these two certainties I add one more: being confused by
and ignorant about investing. Because investing is a confounding activity, you
may be tempted to look with envious eyes at those people in the world who
appear to be savvy with money and investing. Remember that all of us start

with the same level of financial knowledge — that is to say, with none! No one
is born knowing this stuff! The only difference between those who know and
those who don’t is that those who know have invested their time and energy
acquiring knowledge about the investment world.
Taking an Active Role in Selecting 
Your Investments
Before I discuss the major investing alternatives, I want to start with some-
thing that’s quite basic, yet important. What exactly do I mean when I say
“investing”?
Investing means that you have money put away for future use. If you put your
money in your mattress, you’ve chosen an investment — one that pays no
interest and is subject to theft and fire! Many people chose to invest their
money in their mattresses during the Great Depression in the United States in
the early 1930s. Why, you ask? Banks were failing, and the stock market fell
off a cliff. Therefore, during the Great Depression, the mattress was a reason-
able place to invest. (Although many people didn’t know it then, an even
better place to invest their money was in government-backed bonds that
appreciated in value as inflation ebbed.)
Investing involves the process of making choices. Whether you place your
money in the bank, a mattress, or a relative’s business, you ultimately decide
where you invest it. But some people invest some, or even all, of their money
by default — without making a concerted decision. Others invest for reasons
that don’t match their current and long-term best interests. Do any of the fol-
lowing scenarios sound familiar?
 You hold your investment in a “parking place” until you figure out
what to do with your money. Today, the equivalent of the Depression-
era mattress is a bank account. When most people receive money, it
goes into the local bank account (if it isn’t spent first) where it may sit
for years on end earning little, if any, interest.
 Your investments were sold to you by a broker or financial advisor
who was more interested in his profits than yours. Many people hold
investments that they don’t understand, and the investments may not
be appropriate for their financial situation and goals. Perhaps you’re
already a student of the investing school of hard knocks and have lost
money on poor investments ravaged by high commissions and fees.
 Your current investments are based on your previous circumstances.
Although your situation may change slowly from year to year, it may
differ greatly from where you were five or ten years ago. Maybe you
bought investments that made sense for you when you were in a much
10
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

higher or lower tax bracket. Perhaps your investment holdings require
too much time to track and monitor.
 You inherited your investments and stuck with them. What made a good
investment for your parents, grandparents, or other relatives doesn’t
necessarily make sense for you, and who says that what they held ever
was a good investment? You can love a person and honor her memory,
yet still be analytical and practical about the investments that she 
left you.
This book, beginning with this chapter, helps you understand your best
investment options so that you may begin to choose and construct a portfolio
(collection of investments) that fits your financial situation and goals.
Keeping It Simple
Many people think that in order to accumulate significant wealth, they need
to do something complicated and out of the ordinary. The truth is that by fol-
lowing time-tested and simple principles and investment strategies, you can
earn healthy returns and achieve financial independence just as my client
George did.
The first and only time that I met with George was at his home. (This was back
in the days when I made house calls for my financial counseling clients, which
I enjoyed doing because meeting people on their home turf gave me a much
better sense of their situation and personality.) George kept a ledger of his
investments on a sheet of paper that was faded and smelled old. George was a
millionaire, although you’d never know it. I can best describe George’s home
furnishings as spartan — probably from the years of family pets and children
running around the house. The stuffing of his living room couch was falling
out, and he had a Philco television set that was probably black and white.
Despite the fact that George never came close to earning a six-figure salary,
he was able to retire at the age of 50. George didn’t have any advanced
degrees in business or any other subject, and he never went to college. He
accumulated his wealth the old-fashioned (and best) way — through hard
work, savings, and common-sense investing.
In his 20s and 30s, George worked overtime to come up with the necessary
cash to buy a couple of real estate properties. He’s owned real estate ever
since. George also took about 10 percent of each paycheck and invested it 
in stocks.
George didn’t follow any gurus to figure out the right time to sell or trade his
investments. He did some homework, bought sound investments, and turned,
so to speak, into an investing couch potato. “After all the time, trouble, and
work I spent to save up the money and then choose an investment, why
11
Chapter 1: Examining Your Investment Choices

would I want to sell it?” George asks. That’s an excellent question that trigger-
happy traders, especially those who predominate in the world of Internet
trading, may ask themselves too late in life. Buying and then holding sound
investments minimizes trading costs, taxes, and anxiety.
George hired me to get my opinion on whether his portfolio was properly 
balanced and what mutual funds he should invest in, given his tax situation.
Upon hearing about my book, Mutual Funds For Dummies (Wiley), George
agreed that meeting with me (for advice) and reading that book and a couple
of others made the best use of his time and money and fulfilled his educa-
tional needs. You see, George was also smart enough to realize that consul-
tants cost money and that you can find out a lot on your own if you get
pointed in the right direction!
12
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
Proceed with caution: Financial advisors ahead
Too many advisors try to perpetuate the need
for their services. I’ll never forget the lunch that
I had years ago with a tax attorney, Larry, whom
I had heard on a local radio station. On the air,
he seemed well-spoken and knowledgeable. He
called himself “The People’s Attorney.” I met
with Larry because I was curious to find out
more about tax attorneys and the world of radio.
After talking for a while, I asked Larry what his
goals were. Without missing a beat, he said, “To
make as much money as possible in as short a
period of time as possible.” He went on to
explain that his practice didn’t just focus on
taxes, but that he would “help” his clients with
many other legal matters.
“The key, Eric,” Larry said with an almost pater-
nalistic tone in his voice, “is to work on anything
that’s an urgent matter. That way, the customer
is willing to pay my hourly fee of $375.” Gulp!
Larry then offered me a proposition. If I directed
all my clients’ legal needs to him, he’d put me on
a retainer — in other words, kick back money
that he was earning from clients I sent his way.
Larry and I finished lunch, and I went home with
the beginnings of indigestion.
Over the next several weeks, I listened to Larry’s
radio show with fresh ears, and I noticed a
repeated and disturbing pattern. “The People’s
Attorney” was short on specifics in response to
callers’ questions and often went out of his way
to make his answers sound complicated. One
caller asked Larry about using a computer soft-
ware program to create a will, to which Larry
warned ominously, “Would you use a computer
on yourself to perform brain surgery?! There are
so many things that can go wrong.”
Well, preparing a will and making most invest-
ments aren’t even close to performing brain
surgery. You can make intelligent, sound,
wealth-building investment decisions using
your common sense and some relatively simple
strategies without turning over your financial
affairs to financial advisors. Sadly, many advi-
sors are only out to keep you in the dark and
dependent on them so they can maximize their
profits — rather than your profits. (Throughout
this book, I explain when it may make sense for
you to obtain professional advice and the best
method for finding that help.)

While I talked with George, the telephone rang, and after he said hello, he
waited to find out who was calling with all the anticipation of a young child in
line at an amusement park. Then his eyes really lit up as he realized it was his
granddaughter and she would soon be visiting.
George is a wealthy person in many ways. Nearly 80, he possesses great
health and appears to have lots of friends and family. He enjoyed his career
working in a manufacturing environment. George also served his country in
World War II and earned a Purple Heart. In addition to being with his close-
knit family and friends, he spends his time volunteering and traveling.
Although George has significant financial wealth and the ability to save and
invest wisely, he says of his money, “I know that I can’t take it with me.”
You, dear reader, can accomplish what George did. The first step for you on
the road to wealth is to read and internalize the simple yet powerful strate-
gies in this book.
Understanding Common Investments
Literally tens of thousands of different investments exist. There are thou-
sands of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other vehicles. Unfortunately for
the novice, and even for experts who are honest with you, knowing the name
of the investment or company is just the tip of the iceberg. Underneath each
of these investments lurks a veritable mountain of details.
If you wanted to and had the ability, you could make a full-time endeavor out
of analyzing financial statements and talking to business employees, cus-
tomers, suppliers, and so on. However, I don’t want to scare you away from
investing just because some people do it on a full-time basis. Making wise
investments need not take a lot of your time. If you know where to get high-
quality information, and you purchase quality, managed investments, you can
leave the investment management to the best experts. Then you can do the
work that you’re best at and have more free time for fun stuff.
An important part of the “making wise investments” process is knowing when
you have enough information to do things well on your own versus when you
should hire others to help you. For example, investing in foreign stock mar-
kets is generally more difficult to research and understand compared with
domestic markets. Thus, hiring a good money manager, such as through a
mutual fund, makes more sense when investing overseas than going to all the
time, trouble, and expense of trying to pick your own individual stocks.
I’m here to give you enough information to help you make your way through
the complex investment world. In the following sections, I clear a path so that
you can identify the major investments and understand what each is good for.

Chapter 1: Examining Your Investment Choices

Building wealth through 
ownership investments
If you want your money to grow, and you don’t mind a bit of a roller-coaster-
type ride from time to time in your investment’s values, ownership invest-
ments are for you. Ownership investments are those where you own a piece of
some company or other asset (such as stock, real estate, or a small business)
that has the ability to generate revenue and, potentially, profits.
If you want to build wealth, observing how the world’s wealthiest have built
their wealth is enlightening. Not surprisingly, the champions of wealth around
the globe gained their fortunes largely through owning a piece (or all) of a suc-
cessful company that they (or others) have built. Take the case of Bill Gates,
founder and chief executive officer of Microsoft — and college dropout.
Microsoft is the world’s largest producer of personal computer software
(among other related software business lines).
Every time I, or millions of other people, buy a personal computer with one
of these Microsoft software packages, or simply buy or upgrade a Microsoft
software package, Microsoft makes more money. As the largest stockholder in
the company, Gates stands to make more money as increasing sales and prof-
its drive up the stock’s price. Microsoft’s profits and stock price have sky-
rocketed since the company first issued shares of stock back in 1986. (If you
had invested $10,000 in Microsoft in 1986, when the stock was first offered to
the general public, that would have grown to more than $3 million!)
In addition to owning their own businesses, many well-to-do people have
built their nest eggs by investing in real estate and the stock market. And of
course, some people come into wealth the old-fashioned way — they inherit
it. Even if your parents are among the rare wealthy ones and you expect them
to pass on big bucks to you, you need to know how to invest your money
intelligently. Investing like the big boys and girls is a smart move, as long as
you understand and manage the risks.
If you understand and are comfortable with the risks and take sensible steps
to diversify (don’t put all your eggs in the same basket), ownership invest-
ments are the key to building wealth. In order to accomplish typical longer-
term financial goals, such as retiring, the money that you save and invest
needs to grow at a healthy clip. If you dump all your money in bank accounts
that pay little if any interest, you’re likely to fall short of your goals.
Not everyone needs to make his money grow, of course. Suppose that you
inherit a significant sum and/or maintain a restrained standard of living and
work your whole life simply because you enjoy doing so. In this situation, you
may not need to take the risks involved with a potentially faster-growth
investment. You may be more comfortable with safer investments, such as
paying off your mortgage faster than necessary. Chapter 3 helps you think
through such issues.
14
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

The stock market
Stocks are an example of an ownership investment because they represent
shares of ownership in a company.
If you want to share in the growth and profits of companies like Microsoft,
you can! You simply buy shares of their stock through a brokerage firm.
However, just because Microsoft makes money in the future, there’s no guar-
antee that the value of its stock will increase. In fact, the value of your
Microsoft stock can decrease. But at least the next time you call Microsoft
and fork over $50 for technical support, you’ll have some small satisfaction
knowing that you indirectly profit.
Some companies today even sell their stock directly to investors, allowing you
to bypass brokers altogether. You can also invest in stocks via a stock mutual
fund, where a fund manager decides which individual stocks to include in the
fund. (I discuss the various methods for buying stock in Chapter 6.)
The stock market is a fine way to build wealth. In fact, Thomas has used the
stock market to build his wealth over the years. At the age of 75, he is the
proud owner of a portfolio worth more than $1.2 million. Thomas worked for
30 years as a pressman for a newspaper and retired in his early 50s. When he
retired, he was making about $9,000 per year. “I never had a college education
but always made sure to save and invest money each month and watch it
grow,” says Thomas.
You don’t need a B.A., M.B.A., M.D., or Ph.D. to make money in the stock
market. If you can practice some simple lessons, such as making regular and
systematic investments and investing in proven companies and funds while
minimizing your investment expenses and taxes, you’ll be a winner.
However, I don’t believe that you can “beat the markets,” and you certainly
can’t beat the best professional money managers at their own, full-time game.
This book shows you time-proven, nongimmicky methods to make your
money grow in the stock market as well as in other financial markets. (I
explain how in Part II.)
Real estate
Another method that people of varying economic means use to build wealth
is to invest in real estate. Owning and managing real estate is like running a
small business. You need to satisfy customers (tenants), manage your costs,
keep an eye on the competition, and so on. Some methods of real estate
investing require more time than others, but many are proven ways to build
wealth.
John, who works for a city government, and his wife, Linda, a computer ana-
lyst, have built several million dollars in investment real estate equity (the dif-
ference between the property’s market value and debts owed) over the past
three decades. “Our parents owned rental property, and we could see what it
15
Chapter 1: Examining Your Investment Choices

could do for you by providing income and building wealth,” says John.
Investing in real estate also appealed to John and Linda because they didn’t
know anything about the stock market, so they wanted to stay away from it.
The idea of leverage — making money with borrowed money — on the real
estate also appealed to them.
John and Linda bought their first property, a duplex, in 1971, when their com-
bined income was $20,000 per year. Every time they moved to a new home,
they kept the prior one and converted it to a rental. Now in their 50s, John
and Linda own seven pieces of investment real estate and are multimillion-
aires. “It’s like a second retirement, having thousands in monthly income
from the real estate,” says John.
John readily admits that rental real estate has its hassles. “We haven’t
enjoyed getting calls in the middle of the night, but now we have a property
manager who can help with this when we’re not available. It’s also sometimes
a pain finding new tenants,” he says.
Overall, John and Linda figure that they’ve been well rewarded for the time
they spent and the money they invested. The income from John and Linda’s
rental properties allows them to live in a nicer home.
Ultimately, to make your money grow much faster than inflation and taxes,
you must absolutely, positively do at least one thing — take some risk. Any
investment that has real growth potential also has shrinkage potential! You
may not want to take the risk or have the stomach for it. Don’t despair: I dis-
cuss lower-risk investments in this book as well. You can find out about risks
and returns in Chapter 2.

Who wants to invest like a millionaire?
Having a million dollars isn’t nearly as rare as it
used to be. In fact, according to the Spectrem
Group, a firm that conducts research on wealth,
there are now nearly 8 million U.S. households
that have at least one million dollars in wealth
(excluding the value of their primary home).
There are now nearly one million households
with five million dollars or more in wealth.
Interestingly, households with wealth of at 
least one million rarely let financial advisors
direct their investments. Only one of ten such 
households allows advisors to call the shots
and make the moves, whereas 30 percent don’t
use any advisors. The remaining 60 percent
consult an advisor on an as-needed basis and
then make their own moves.
As in past surveys, recent wealth surveys show
that affluent investors achieved and built upon
their wealth with ownership investments, such
as their own small businesses, real estate, and
stocks.

Small business
I know people who have hit investing “home runs” by owning or buying a
business. Unlike the part-time nature of investing in the stock market, most
people work at running their business full time, increasing their chances of
doing something big financially with it. If you try to invest in individual
stocks, by contrast, you’re likely to work at it part time, competing against
professionals who invest practically around the clock.
A decade ago, Calvin set out to develop a corporate publishing firm. Because
he took the risk of starting his business and has been successful in slowly
building it, today, in his early 50s, he enjoys a net worth in excess of $10 mil-
lion and can retire if he wants. Even more important to many business
owners — and the reason that financially successful entrepreneurs such as
Calvin don’t call it quits after they’ve amassed a lot of cash — are the nonfi-
nancial rewards of investing, including the challenge and fulfillment of operat-
ing a successful business.
Sandra has worked on her own as an interior designer for more than two
decades. She previously worked in fashion, as a model, and then as a retail
store manager. Her first taste of interior design was redesigning rooms at a
condominium project. “I knew when I did that first building and turned it into
something wonderful and profitable that I loved doing this kind of work,” says
Sandra. Today, Sandra’s firm specializes in the restoration of landmark hotels,
and her work has been written up in numerous magazines. “The money is not
of primary importance to me . . . my work is driven by a passion . . . but obvi-
ously it has to be profitable,” she says. Sandra has also experienced the fun
and enjoyment of designing hotels in many parts of the United States and
overseas, including one in Japan.
Most small business owners (myself included) quickly point out that the
entrepreneurial life is not a walk through the rose garden (although it does
have its share of thorns). Emotionally and financially, entrepreneurship is
sometimes a roller coaster. In addition to the financial rewards, however,
small business owners can enjoy seeing the impact of their work and knowing
that it makes a difference. Combined, Calvin and Sandra’s firms created
dozens of new jobs.
Not everyone needs to be sparked by the desire to start her own company to
profit from small business. You can share in the economic rewards of the
entrepreneurial world through buying an existing business or investing in
someone else’s budding enterprise. I talk more about evaluating and buying a
business in Part IV of this book (and in the latest edition of Small Business For
Dummies, written by Jim Schell and me; published by Wiley).

Chapter 1: Examining Your Investment Choices

Generating income from 
lending investments
The other major types of investment include those in which you lend your
money. Suppose that like most people, you keep some money in your local
bank — most likely in a checking account, but perhaps also in a savings account
or certificate of deposit (CD). No matter what type of bank account you place
your money in, what you’re doing is lending your money to the bank.
How long and under what conditions you lend money to your bank depends
on the specific bank and account that you use. With a CD, you commit to lend
your money to the bank for a specific length of time — perhaps six months or
even a year. In return, the bank probably pays you a higher rate of interest
than if you put your money in a bank account offering you immediate access
to the money. (You may demand termination of the CD early; however, you’ll
be penalized.)
As I discuss in more detail in Chapter 8, you can also invest your money in
bonds — another type of lending investment. When you purchase a bond
that has been issued by the government or a company, you agree to lend
your money for a predetermined period of time and receive a particular rate
of interest. A bond may pay you 6 percent interest over the next five years,
for example.
An investor’s return from lending investments is typically limited to the origi-
nal investment plus interest payments. If you lend your money to Microsoft
through one of its bonds that matures, say, in ten years, and Microsoft triples
in size over the next decade, you won’t share in its growth. Microsoft’s stock-
holders and employees reap the rewards of the company’s success, but as a
bondholder, you don’t.
Many people keep too much of their money in lending investments, thus
allowing others to reap the rewards of economic growth. Although lending
investments appear safer because you know in advance what return you will
receive, they aren’t that safe. The long-term risk of these seemingly safe
money investments is that your money will grow too slowly to enable you to
accomplish your personal financial goals. In the worst cases, the company or
other institution to which you’re lending money can go under and stiff you
for your loan.
Considering cash equivalents
Cash equivalents are any investments that you can quickly convert to cash
without cost to you. Of course, the cash in your wallet qualifies as a cash
equivalent. With most checking accounts, for example, you can write a check
or withdraw cash by visiting a teller — either the live or the automated type.
18
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

Money market mutual funds are another type of cash equivalent. Investors,
both large and small, invest hundreds of billions of dollars in money market
mutual funds because the best money market funds produce higher yields
than bank savings accounts. The yield advantage of a money market fund
almost always widens when interest rates increase because banks move
about as fast as molasses on a cold winter day to raise savings account rates.
Why shouldn’t you take advantage of an extra 1 or 2 percent yield? Many bank
savers sacrifice this yield because they think that money market funds are
risky — but they’re not. Money market mutual funds generally invest in ultra-
safe things such as short-term bank certificates of deposit, U.S. government-
issued Treasury bills, and commercial paper (short-term bonds) that the
most creditworthy corporations issue.
Another reason people keep too much money in traditional bank accounts is
that the local bank branch office makes the cash seem more accessible.
Money market mutual funds, however, offer many quick ways to get your
cash. You can write a check (most funds stipulate the check must be for at
least $250) or call the fund and request that it mail or wire you money.
19
Chapter 1: Examining Your Investment Choices
The double whammy of inflation and taxes
Bank accounts and bonds that pay a decent
return are reassuring to many investors. Earning
a small amount of interest sure beats losing
some or all your money in a risky investment.
The problem is that money in a savings account,
for example, that pays 3 percent isn’t actually
yielding you 3 percent. It’s not that the bank is
lying — it’s just that your investment bucket
contains some not-so-obvious holes.
The first hole is taxes. When you earn interest,
you must pay taxes on it (unless you invest the
money in a retirement account, in which case
you generally pay the taxes at a later date,
when you withdraw the money). If you’re a 
moderate-income earner, you end up losing
about a third of your interest to taxes. Your 
3 percent return is now down to 2 percent.
But the second hole in your investment bucket
can be even bigger than taxes: inflation.
Although a few products become cheaper over
time (computers, for example), most goods and
services increase in price. Inflation in the United
States is running right around 3 percent per
year. Inflation depresses the purchasing power
of your investment’s returns. If you subtract the
3 percent “cost” of inflation from the remaining
2 percent after payment of taxes, I’m sorry to
say that you lost 1 percent on your investment.
To recap: For every dollar you invested in the
bank a year ago, despite the fact that the bank
paid you your 3 pennies of interest, you’re left
with only 99 cents in real purchasing power for
every dollar you had a year ago. In other words,
thanks to the inflation and tax holes in your
investment bucket, you can buy less with your
money now versus what you could have a year
ago, even though you’ve invested your money
for a year.

By all means, keep your checking account at the local bank so that you can
write smaller checks to pay your cable television, phone, and utility bills.
Having local access to an ATM for fast cash withdrawals is also a plus. But
move that extra money that’s dozing away in your bank savings account, for
example, into a higher-yielding money market mutual fund! Even if you have
just a few thousand dollars, the extra yield more than pays for the cost of this
book. If you’re in a high tax bracket, you can also use tax-free money market
funds. (See Chapter 8 to find out more about money market funds.)
Steering clear of futures and options
Suppose you think that IBM’s stock is a good investment. The direction that
the management team is taking impresses you, and you like the products and
services that the company offers. Profits seem to be on a positive trend;
everything’s looking up.
You can go out and buy the stock — suppose that it’s currently trading at
around $100 per share. If the price rises to $150 in the next six months,
you’ve made yourself a 50 percent profit ($150 – $100 = $50) on your original
$100 investment. (Of course, you have to pay some brokerage fees to buy and
then sell the stock.)
But instead of buying the stock outright, you can buy what are known as call
options on IBM. A call option gives you the right to buy shares of IBM under
specified terms from the person who sells you the call option. You may be
able to purchase a call option that allows you to exercise your right to buy
IBM stock at, say, $120 per share in the next six months. For this privilege,
you may pay $10 per share.
If IBM’s stock price skyrockets to, say, $150 in the next few months, the value
of your options that allow you to buy the stock at $120 will be worth a lot —
at least $30. You can then simply sell your options, which you bought for $10
in this example, at a huge profit — you’ve tripled your money.
Although this talk of fat profits sounds much more exciting than simply
buying the stock directly and making far less money from a stock price
increase, options have two big problems:
 If IBM’s stock price goes nowhere or rises only a little during the six-
month period when you hold the call option, the option expires as
worthless, and you lose all — that is, 100 percent — of your investment.
In fact, in my example, if IBM’s stock trades at $120 or less at the time
the option expires, the option is worthless.
 A call option represents a short-term gamble (in this example, over the
next six months) on IBM’s stock price — not an investment in IBM. IBM
could expand its business and profits greatly in the years and decades
20
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

ahead, but the value of the call option hinges on the ups and downs of
IBM’s stock price over a relatively short period of time. If the stock
market happens to dip in the next six months, IBM may get pulled down
as well, despite the company’s improving financial health.
Futures are similar to options in that both can be used as gambling instruments.
Futures deal mainly with the value of commodities such as heating oil, corn,
wheat, gold, silver, and pork bellies. Futures have a delivery date that’s in the
not-too-distant future. (Do you really want bushels of wheat delivered to your
home? Or worse yet, pork bellies?) You can place a small down payment —
around 10 percent — toward the purchase of futures, thereby greatly leverag-
ing your “investment.” If prices fall, you need to put up more money to keep
from having your position sold.
My advice: Don’t gamble with futures and options.
The only real use that you may (if ever) have for these derivatives (so called
because their value is “derived” from the price of other securities) is to
hedge. Suppose that you hold a lot of a stock that has greatly appreciated,
and you don’t want to sell now because of the tax bite. Perhaps you want to
postpone selling the stock until next year because you plan on not working,
or you can then benefit from the lower, long-term capital gains tax rate. You
can buy what’s called a put option, which increases in value when a stock’s
price falls (because the put option grants you the right to sell your stock to
the purchaser of the put option at a preset stock price). Thus, if the stock
price does fall, the rising put option value offsets some of your losses on the
stock you still hold. Using put options allows you to postpone selling your
stock without exposing yourself to the risk of a falling stock price.
Passing on precious metals
Over the millennia, gold and silver have served as mediums of exchange or
currency because they have intrinsic value and can’t be debased the way
that paper currencies can (by printing more money). These precious metals
are used in jewelry and manufacturing.
As investments, gold and silver perform well during bouts of inflation. For
example, from 1972 to 1980, when inflation zoomed into the double-digit
range in the United States and stocks and bonds went into the tank, gold and
silver prices skyrocketed more than 500 percent.
Generally over the long term, however, precious metals are lousy invest-
ments. They don’t pay any dividends, and their price increases generally just
keep you up with, but not ahead of, increases in the cost of living. Although
investing in precious metals is better than keeping cash in a piggy bank or
stuffing it in a mattress, the investment returns aren’t nearly as good as
bonds, stocks, and real estate.

Chapter 1: Examining Your Investment Choices

Counting out collectibles
The term “collectibles” is a catchall category for antiques, art, autographs,
baseball cards, clocks, coins, comic books, diamonds, dolls, gems, pho-
tographs, rare books, rugs, stamps, vintage wine, writing utensils, and a
whole host of other items. Although connoisseurs of fine art, antiques, and
vintage wine wouldn’t like the comparison of their pastime with buying old
playing cards or chamber pots, the bottom line is that collectibles are all
objects with little intrinsic value. Wine is just a bunch of old mushed-up
grapes. A painting is simply a canvas and some paint that at retail would set
you back a few bucks. Stamps are small pieces of paper, less than an inch
square. Baseball cards — heck, my childhood friends and I used to stick
these between our bike spokes!
I’m not trying to diminish contributions that artists and others make to our
culture. And I know that some people place a high value on some of these col-
lectibles. But true investments that can make your money grow, such as
stocks, real estate, or a small business, are assets that can produce income
and profits. Collectibles have little intrinsic value and are thus subject to the
whims and speculations of buyers and sellers. 
Here are some other major problems with collectibles:
 Markups are huge. The spread between the price that a dealer pays for
an object and then sells the same exact object for is often around 100
percent. Sometimes the difference is even greater, particularly if a dealer
is the second or third middleman in the chain of purchase. So at a mini-
mum, your purchase must typically double in value just to get you back
to even. And that may take 10 to 20 years or more!
 Lots of other costs add up. If the markups aren’t bad enough, with some
collectibles you incur all sorts of other costs. If you buy more expensive
pieces, you may need to have them appraised. You may have to pay
storage and insurance costs as well. And unlike the markup, you pay
some of these fees year after year after year of ownership.
 You can get stuck with a pig in a poke. Sometimes, you may overpay
even more for a collectible because you don’t realize some imperfection
or inferiority of an item. Worse, you may buy a forgery. Even reputable
dealers have been duped by forgeries.
 Your pride and joy can deteriorate over time. Damage from sunlight,
humidity, temperatures that are too high or too low, and a whole host of
vagaries can ruin the quality of your collectible. Insurance doesn’t cover
this type of damage or negligence on your part.
22
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

 The returns stink. Even if you ignore the substantial costs of buying,
holding, and selling, the average returns that investors earn from col-
lectibles rarely keep ahead of inflation and are generally inferior to stock
market, real estate, and small business investing. Objective collectible
return data are hard to come by. Never, ever trust “data” that dealers or
the many collectible trade publications provide.
The best returns that collectible investors reap come from the ability to iden-
tify, years in advance, items that will become popular. Do you think you can
do that? You may be the smartest person in the world, but you should know
that most dealers can’t tell what’s going to rocket to popularity in the coming
decades. Dealers make their profits the same way as other retailers, from the
spread or markup on the merchandise that they sell. The public and collec-
tors have fickle, quirky tastes that no one can predict. Did you know that
Beanie Babies, Furbies, Pet Rocks, or Cabbage Patch Kids were going to be
such hits?
You can find out enough about a specific type of collectible to become a
better investor than the average person, but you’re going to have to be
among the best — perhaps the top 10 percent of such collectors — to have a
shot at earning decent returns. To get to this level of expertise, you need to
invest hundreds if not thousands of hours reading, researching, and educat-
ing yourself about your specific type of collectible.
Nothing is wrong with spending money on collectibles, but I don’t want you to
fool yourself into thinking that they’re investments. You can sink lots of your
money into these non-income-producing, poor-return “investments.” At their
best as investments, collectibles give the wealthy a way to buy quality stuff
that doesn’t depreciate.
If you must buy collectibles, here are some tips to keep in mind:
 Collect for your love of the collectible, your desire to enjoy it, or your
interest in finding out about or mastering a subject, not because you
expect high investment returns, because you probably won’t get them.
 Keep quality items that you and your family have purchased and hope
that someday they’re worth something. Keeping these quality items is
the simplest way to break into the collectible business. The complete
sets of baseball cards I gathered as a youngster are now (30-plus years
later) worth hundreds of dollars to, in one case, $1,000!
 Buy from the source and cut out the middlemen whenever possible. In
some cases, you may be able to buy from the artist. (My brother pur-
chases most of his pottery directly from artists.)
23
Chapter 1: Examining Your Investment Choices

 Check collectibles that are comparable to the one you have your eye on,
shop around, and don’t be afraid to negotiate. An effective way to negoti-
ate, after you decide what you like, is to make your offer to the dealer or
artist by phone. Because the seller isn’t standing right next to you, you
don’t feel pressure to decide immediately.
 Ask the dealer who thinks that the item is such a great investment for a
written guarantee to buy back the item from you, if you opt to sell, for at
least the same price you paid or higher within five years.
 Use a comprehensive resource to research, buy, sell, maintain, and
improve your collectible, such as the books by Ralph and Terry Kovel or
their Web site at www.kovels.com.

A
woman passes up eating a hamburger at a picnic because she heard
that she could contract a deadly E. coli infection from eating improperly
cooked meat. The next week, that same woman hops in the passenger seat of
her friend’s car without buckling her seatbelt. Minutes later, the car is struck
head on, and the woman dies.
A young child is about to go for a bike ride when her parents notice that she
left her bike helmet in the garage. The parents call the child back to put on
her helmet. The next day, that same girl goes to a friend’s house to play with
a boy who finds his parents’ loaded gun, even though his older brother is at
home.
I’m not trying to depress or frighten anyone. However, I am trying to make an
important point about risk — something that we all deal with on a daily basis.
Risk is in the eye of the beholder. Many of us base our perception of risk, in
large part, on our experiences and what we’ve been exposed to. Many people
fret about relatively small risks while overlooking much larger risks.
Sure, a risk of an E. coli infection from eating poorly cooked meat exists, so
the woman who was leery of eating the hamburger at the picnic had a legiti-
mate concern. However, that same woman got into the friend’s car without an
airbag and placed herself at far greater risk of dying in that situation than if
she had eaten the hamburger. Annually in the United States, more than 40,000
people die in automobile accidents.
Likewise, although the parents had a right to be concerned about their young
daughter suffering a head injury should she fall off her bike, they completely

overlooked the significant risk of an improperly stored gun in other house-
holds. According to research conducted by the nonprofit Center to Prevent
Handgun Violence, an astounding 43 percent of U.S. households with children
contain a firearm, and 28 percent of these gun-owning parents do not keep
the gun locked or otherwise secured.
Evaluating Risks
Everywhere you turn, risks exist; some are just more apparent than others.
Many people misunderstand risks. With increased knowledge, you may be
able to reduce or conquer some of your fears and make more sensible deci-
sions about reducing risks. For example, some people who fear flying don’t
understand that statistically, flying is much safer than driving a car. You’re
approximately 40 times more likely to die in a motor vehicle than in an air-
plane. But when a plane goes down, it’s big news. Dozens and sometimes
hundreds of people, who probably weren’t under the influence or engaging in
otherwise reckless behavior, perish. Meanwhile, the media seem to pay less
attention to the handfuls of people who die on the road every day.
This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t drive or fly, or that you shouldn’t drive
to the airport. However, you may consider steps you can take to reduce the
significant risks you expose yourself to in a car. For example, you can get a
car with more safety features, or you may bypass riding with reckless taxi dri-
vers whose cars lack seatbelts.
Although some of us like to live life to its fullest and take “fun” risks (how else
can you explain triathletes, mountain climbers, parachutists, and bungee
jumpers?), most people seek to minimize risk and maximize enjoyment in
their lives. But most people also understand that they’d be a lot less happy
living a life that sought to eliminate all risks, and they likely wouldn’t be able
to anyway.
Likewise, if you attempt to avoid all the risks that investing involves, you
won’t succeed, and you likely won’t be happy with your investment results
and lifestyle. In the investment world, some people don’t go near stocks or
any investment that they perceive to be volatile. As a result, such investors
often end up with lousy long-term returns, and they expose themselves to
some high risks that they overlooked, such as the risk of inflation and taxes
eroding the purchasing power of their money.
You can’t live without taking risks. Risk-free activities or ways of living don’t
exist. You can minimize, but never eliminate, risks. Some methods of risk
reduction aren’t palatable because they reduce your quality of life. Risks are
also composed of several factors. In the sections that follow, I discuss the vari-
ous types of investment risks and methods that you can use to sensibly reduce
these risks while not missing out on the upside that growth investments offer.
26
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

Market-value risk
Although the stock market can help you build wealth, most people recognize
that it can also drop substantially — by 10, 20, 30 percent, or more in a rela-
tively short period of time. After peaking in 2000, U.S. stocks, as measured by
the large-company S&P 500 index, dropped about 50 percent by 2002. Stocks
on the NASDAQ, which is heavily weighted toward technology stocks, plunged
more than 76 percent from 2000 through 2002! And in a mere six weeks (from
mid-July 1998 to early September 1998), large-company U.S. stocks plunged
about 20 percent. (An index of smaller-company U.S. stocks plunged 33 per-
cent over a slightly longer period of two and a half months.) 
If you think that the U.S. stock market crash that occurred in the fall of 1987
was a big one (the market plunged 36 percent in a matter of weeks), take a
look at Table 2-1, which lists plunges over the past 100-plus years that were
all worse than the 1987 crash.

Real estate exhibits similar unruly, annoying tendencies. Although real estate
(like stocks) has been a terrific long-term investment, various real estate mar-
kets get clobbered from time to time.
U.S. housing prices took almost a 25 percent tumble from the late 1920s to
the mid-1930s. When the oil industry collapsed in the southern United States
in the early 1980s, real estate prices took a beating in that area. Later in the
1980s and early 1990s, the northeastern United States became mired in a
severe recession, and real estate prices plummeted by more than 20 percent
27
Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns

in many areas. After peaking near 1990, many of the West Coast housing mar-
kets, especially those in California, experienced falling prices — dropping 20
percent or more in most areas by the mid-1990s. The Japanese real estate
market crash also began around the time of the California market fall.
Property prices in Japan collapsed more than 60 percent.
After reading this section, you may want to keep all your money in the bank —
after all, you know you won’t lose your money, and you won’t have to be a
nonstop worrier. No one has ever lost 20, 40, 60, or 80 percent of his bank-
held savings vehicle in a few years! But just letting your money sit around
would be a mistake.
If you pass up the stock and real estate markets simply because of the poten-
tial market value risk, you miss out on a historic, time-tested method of build-
ing substantial wealth.
Later in this chapter, I show you the generous returns that these investments
historically provide. The following sections suggest some simple things you
can do to lower your investing risk and help prevent your portfolio from suf-
fering a huge fall.
Diversify for a gentler ride
Individual stock markets may crash. However, the various stock markets
around the world have never all crashed at the same time. For example, when
the U.S. stock market crashed in the fall of 1987, many foreign stock markets
dropped far less or not at all. So if you had spread your money across the
many different stock markets, your portfolio wouldn’t have suffered nearly as
much as it would have if you held all your stocks in the U.S. market.
You can invest overseas to reduce your investment risk if you worry about
the health of the U.S. economy, the government, and the dollar. Most large
U.S. companies do business overseas, so when you invest in larger U.S. com-
pany stocks, you get some international investment exposure. You can also
invest in international company stocks, ideally via mutual funds (which I dis-
cuss in Chapter 8).
Of course, investing overseas can’t totally protect you. You can’t do much
about a global economic catastrophe. If you worry about the risk of such a
calamity, you should probably also worry about a huge meteor crashing into
Earth. Maybe there’s a way to colonize outer space. . . .
Diversifying your investments can involve more than just your stock portfo-
lio, however. You can also hold some real estate investments to diversify your
investment portfolio. Many real estate markets actually appreciated in the
early 2000s while the U.S. stock market was in the doghouse.

Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

Consider your time horizon
Investors who worry that the stock market may take a dive and take their
money down with it should first consider the length of time that they plan to
invest. In a one-year period in the stock and bond markets, anything can
happen (as shown in Figure 2-1). History shows that about once in every
three years that you invest in the stock and bond markets, you lose money.
However, stock market investors make money (sometimes substantial
amounts) approximately two-thirds of the time over a one-year time period.
(Bond investors make money about two-thirds of the time, too, although they
make a good deal less on average.)

Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns

Although the stock market is more volatile in the short term than the bond
market, stock market investors earn far better long-term returns than do
bond investors. (See the “Stock returns” section, later in this chapter.)
Remember, however, that bonds generally outperform a boring old bank
account.
The risk of a stock- or bond-market fall becomes less of a concern the longer
the period that you plan to invest. As Figure 2-2 shows, as the holding period
during which you own stocks increases from 1 year to 3 years to 5 years to 10
years, and then to 20 years, your likelihood of making a profit increases. In
fact, over any 20-year time span, U.S. stock market investors have never lost
money, even after you subtract for the effects of inflation.

Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

Most stock market investors whom I know are concerned about losing
money. Figure 2-2 clearly shows that the key to minimizing the probability
that you’ll lose money in stocks is to hold them for the longer term. Don’t
invest in stocks unless you plan to hold them for at least five years — and
preferably a decade or longer. Please see Part II of this book for more on
using stocks as a long-term investment.
Pare down holdings in bloated markets
Perhaps you’ve heard the expression “Buy low, sell high.” Although I don’t
believe that you can time the markets (that is, predict the most profitable
time to buy and sell), spotting a greatly overpriced market isn’t too difficult.
For example, in the second edition of this book, published in 1999, I warned
readers about the grossly inflated prices of many Internet and technology
stocks (see Chapter 5). Throughout this book, I explain some simple yet pow-
erful methods you can use to measure whether a particular investment
market is of fair value, of good value, or overpriced. You should avoid over-
priced investments for two important reasons:
 If and when these overpriced investments fall, they usually fall farther
and faster than more fairly priced investments.
 You can always find other investments that offer higher potential
returns.
Ideally, you want to avoid having a lot of your money in markets that appear
overvalued (see Chapter 5 for how to spot pricey markets). Practically speak-
ing, avoiding overvalued markets doesn’t mean that you should try to sell all
your holdings in such markets with the vain hope of buying them back at a
much lower price. However, you may benefit from the following strategies:
 Invest new money elsewhere. Focus investment of new money some-
where other than the overvalued market; put it into investments that
offer you better values. Thus, without selling any of your seemingly
expensive investments, they become a smaller portion of your total
holdings. If you hold investments outside tax-sheltered retirement
accounts, focusing your money elsewhere also offers the benefit 
of allowing you to avoid incurring taxes from selling appreciated 
investments.
 If you have to sell, sell the expensive stuff. If you need to raise money
to live on, such as for retirement or for a major purchase, sell the big-
ticket items. As long as the taxes aren’t too troublesome, it’s better to
sell high and lock in your profits. Chapter 21 discusses issues to weigh
when you contemplate selling an investment.
31
Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns

Individual-investment risk
A downdraft can put an entire investment market on a roller-coaster ride, but
healthy markets also have their share of individual losers. For example, from
the early 1980s through the late 1990s, the U.S. stock market had one of the
greatest appreciating markets in history. You’d never know it, though, if you
look at these losers.
Consider a company now called Navistar, which has undergone enormous
transformations in the past two decades. This company used to be called
International Harvester and manufactured farm equipment, trucks, and con-
struction and other industrial equipment. Today, Navistar makes mostly trucks.
As recently as late 1983, this company’s stock traded at more than $140 per
share. It then plunged more than 90 percent over the ensuing decade (as
shown in Figure 2-3). Even with a rally in recent years, Navistar stock still
trades at under $40 per share (after dipping below $10 per share). Lest you
think that’s a big drop, this company’s stock traded as high as $455 per share
in the early 1970s! If a worker retired from this company in the early 1970s
with $200,000 invested in the company stock, the retiree’s investment would
be worth about $20,000 today! On the other hand, if the retiree had simply
swapped his stock at retirement for a diversified portfolio of stocks, which I
explain how to build in Part II, his $200,000 nest egg would’ve instead grown
to more than $2,000,000!
Just as individual stock prices can plummet, so can individual real estate
property prices. In California, for example, earthquakes rocked the prices of
properties built on landfill during the 1990s. These quakes highlighted the
dangers of building on poor soil. In the early 1980s, real estate values in the
communities of Times Beach, Missouri, and Love Canal, New York, plunged
due to carcinogenic toxic waste contamination. (Ultimately, many property

owners in these areas were compensated for their losses by the federal gov-
ernment, as well as by some real estate agencies that didn’t disclose these
known contaminants.)
Here are some simple steps you can take to lower the risk of individual
investments that can upset your goals:
 Do your homework. When you purchase real estate, a whole host of
inspections can save you from buying a money pit. With stocks, you can
examine some measures of value and the company’s financial condition
and business strategy to reduce your chances of buying into an over-
priced company or one on the verge of major problems. Parts II, III, and IV
of this book give you more information on researching your investment.
 Diversify. Investors who seek growth invest in securities such as stocks.
Placing significant amounts of your capital in one or a handful of securi-
ties is risky, particularly if the stocks are in the same industry or closely
related industries. To reduce this risk, purchase stocks in a variety of
industries and companies within each industry. (See Part II for details.)
 Hire someone to invest for you. The best mutual funds (see Chapter 8)
offer low-cost, professional management and oversight, as well as diver-
sification. Stock mutual funds typically own 25 or more securities in a
variety of companies in different industries. In Part III, I explain how you
can invest in real estate in a similar way (that is, by leaving the driving
to someone else).
33
Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
Liquidity
The term liquidity refers to how long it takes and
at what cost you can convert an investment into
cash. The money in your wallet is considered
perfectly liquid — it’s already cash.
Suppose that you invested money in a handful
of stocks. Although you can’t easily sell these
stocks on a Saturday night, you can sell most
stocks quickly through a broker for a nominal
fee any day that the financial markets are open
(normal working days). You pay a higher per-
centage to sell your stocks if you use a high-
cost broker or if you have a small amount of
stock to sell.
Real estate is generally much less liquid than
stock. Preparing your property for sale takes
time, and if you want to get fair market value for
your property, finding a buyer may take weeks
or months. Selling costs (agent commissions,
fix-up expenses, and closing costs) can easily
approach 10 percent of the home’s value.
A privately run small business is among the
least liquid of the better growth investments that
you can make. Selling such a business typically
takes longer than selling most real estate.
So that you’re not forced to sell one of your
investments that you intend to hold for long-
term purposes, keep an emergency reserve of
three to six months’ worth of living expenses in
a money market account. Also consider invest-
ing some money in bonds (see Chapter 8), which
pay higher than money market yields without
the high risk or volatility that comes with the
stock market.

Purchasing-power risk
Increases in the cost of living can erode the value of your retirement
resources and what you can buy with that money — also known as its pur-
chasing power. When Ethel retired at the age of 60, she was pleased with her
retirement income. She was receiving an $800-per-month pension and $1,200
per month from money that she had invested in long-term bonds. Her
monthly expenditures amounted to about $1,500, so she was able to save a
little money for an occasional trip.
Fast-forward 15 years. Ethel still receives $800 per month from her pension,
but now she gets only $900 per month of investment income, which comes
from some certificates of deposit. Ethel bailed out of bonds after she lost
sleep over the sometimes roller-coaster-like price movements in the bond
market. Her monthly expenditures now amount to approximately $2,400, and
she uses some of her investment principal (original investment). She’s terri-
fied of outliving her money.
Ethel has reason to worry. She has 100 percent of her money invested with-
out protection against increases in the cost of living. Although her income
felt comfortable in the beginning of her retirement, it doesn’t at age 75, and
Ethel may easily live another 15 or more years.
The erosion of the purchasing power of your investment dollar can, over
longer time periods, be as bad as or worse than the effect of a major market
crash. Table 2-2 shows the effective loss in purchasing power of your money
at various rates of inflation and over differing time periods.

As a financial counselor, I often see skittish investors who try to keep their
money in bonds and money market accounts, thinking they’re playing it safe.
The risk in this strategy is that your money won’t grow enough over the years
34
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

in order for you to accomplish your financial goals. In other words, the lower
the return that you earn, the more you need to save to reach a particular
financial goal.
A 40-year-old wanting to accumulate $500,000 by age 65 would need to save
$722 per month if she earns a 6 percent average annual return but needs to
save only $377 per month if she earns 10 percent average return per year.
Younger investors need to pay the most attention to the risk of generating
low returns, but so should younger senior citizens. At the age of 65, seniors
need to recognize that a portion of their assets may not be used for a decade
or more from the present.
Ironically, some people feel safe keeping much of their money in low-yielding
Treasury bonds issued by the U.S. government. Lending your money to the
government has some patriotic value, but it certainly isn’t 100 percent risk free.
Remember also that the federal government has a total debt of over $7 trillion.
35
Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
Inflation ragin’ outta control
You think 6, 8, or 10 percent annual inflation
rates are bad? How would you like to live in a
country that experienced that rate of inflation 
in a day?! As I discuss in Chapter 4, too much
money in circulation chasing after too few
goods causes high rates of inflation.
A government that runs amok with the nation’s
currency and money supply usually causes
excessive rates of inflation — dubbed hyperin-
flation. Over the decades and centuries, hyper-
inflation has wreaked havoc in more than a few
countries.
What happened in Germany in the late 1910s
and early 1920s demonstrates how bad hyper-
inflation can get. Consider that during this time
period, prices increased nearly one billion-
fold!!! What cost 1 reichsmark (the German 
currency in those days) at the beginning of 
this mess eventually cost nearly 1,000,000,000
reichsmarks. People had to cart around so
much currency that at times they needed
wheelbarrows to haul it! Ultimately, this infla-
tionary burden was too much for the German
society, creating a social climate that fueled the
rise of the Nazi party and Adolf Hitler.
During the 1990s, a number of countries, espe-
cially many that made up the former U.S.S.R.
and others such as Brazil and Lithuania, have
gotten themselves into a hyperinflationary mess
with inflation rates of several hundred percent
per year. In the mid-1980s, Bolivia’s yearly infla-
tion rate exceeded 10,000 percent.
Governments often try to slap on price controls
to prevent runaway inflation (President Richard
Nixon did this in the United States in the 1970s),
but the underground economy, known as the
black market, usually prevails.

Career risk
Your ability to earn money is most likely your single biggest asset, or at least
one of your biggest assets. Most people achieve what they do in the working
world through education and hard work. By education, I’m not simply talking
about what one learns in formal schooling. Education is a lifelong process.
I’ve learned far more about business from my own front-line experiences and
those of others than I’ve learned in educational settings. I also read a lot. (In
Part V, I recommend books and other resources that I’ve found most useful.)
If you don’t continually invest in your education, you risk losing your compet-
itive edge. Your skills and perspectives can become dated and obsolete.
Although that doesn’t mean you should work 80 hours a week and never do
anything fun, it does mean that part of your “work” time should always involve
updating and building on your skills. The best organizations are those that
recognize the need for continual knowledge and invest in their workforce
through training and career development. Just remember to look at your own
career objectives, which may not be the same as your company’s.
Analyzing Returns
When you make investments, you have the potential to make money in a vari-
ety of ways. Each type of investment has its own mix of associated risks that
you take when you part with your investment dollar and, likewise, offers a dif-
ferent potential rate of return. In this section, I cover the returns you can
expect with each of the common investing avenues, but first, I walk you through
the different components of calculating total return on an investment.
The components of total return
To figure out exactly how much money you’ve made (or lost) on your invest-
ment, you need to calculate the total return. To come up with this figure, you
need to determine how much money you originally invested and then factor
in the other components, such as interest, dividends, and appreciation (or
depreciation).
If you’ve ever had money in a bank account that pays interest, you know that
the bank pays you a small amount of interest for your allowing it to keep your
money. The bank then turns around and lends your money to some other
person or organization at a much higher rate of interest. The rate of interest
is also known as the yield. So if a bank tells you that its savings account pays
2 percent interest, the bank may also say that it is yielding 2 percent. Banks
36
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

usually quote interest rates or yields on an annual basis. Interest that you
receive is one component of the return you receive on your investment.
If a bank pays monthly interest, for example, the bank also likely quotes a
compounded effective annual yield. After the first month’s interest is credited
to your account, that interest starts earning interest as well. So the bank may
say that the account pays 2 percent, which compounds to an effective annual
yield of 2.04 percent.
When you lend your money directly to a company — which is what you do
when you invest in a bond that a corporation issues — you also receive inter-
est. Bonds, as well as stocks (which are shares of ownership in a company),
fluctuate in value after they’re issued.
When you invest in a company’s stock, you hope that the stock increases
(appreciates) in value. Of course, a stock can also decline, or depreciate, in
value. This change in market value is part of your return from a stock or bond
investment:
For example, if one year ago you invested $10,000 in a stock (you bought
1,000 shares at $10 per share), and the investment is now worth $11,000
(each share is worth $11), your investment’s appreciation is
But stocks can also pay dividends, which are the company’s sharing of some
of its profits with you as a stockholder. Some companies, particularly those
that are small or growing rapidly, choose to reinvest all their profits back into
the company. (Of course, some companies don’t turn a profit, so there’s noth-
ing to pay out!) You need to factor these dividends into your return as well.
Suppose that in the previous example, in addition to your stock appreciating
$1,000 to $11,000, it paid you a dividend of $100 ($1 per share). Here’s how
you calculate your total return:
(Current investment value – Original investment) + Dividends
Original investment
= Total return
$11,000 – $10,000
$10,000
= 10%
Current investment value – Original investment
Original investment
= Appreciation or depreciation
37
Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns

Or, to apply it to the example
After-tax returns
Although you may be happy that your stock has given you an 11 percent
return on your invested dollars, remember: Unless you held your investment
in a tax-sheltered retirement account, you owe taxes on your return.
Specifically, the dividends and investment appreciation that you realize upon
selling are taxed, although thanks to recent tax law changes, they may be
taxed at relatively low rates. And if you’re talking about savings accounts,
money market accounts, or bonds, you owe Uncle Sam taxes on the interest.
Often, people make investing decisions without considering the tax conse-
quences of their moves. This is a big mistake. What good is making money if
the federal and state governments take a substantial portion of it away?
If you’re in a moderate tax bracket, taxes on your investment probably run in
the neighborhood of 30 percent (federal and state). So if your investment
returned 7 percent before taxes, you’re left with a return of 4.9 percent after
taxes. You may know that the tax rate on so-called long-term capital gains
and stock dividends are lower than the tax rate on other income. In Chapter
3, I discuss the different tax rates that affect your investments and explain
how to make tax-wise investment decisions that fit with your overall personal
financial situation and goals.
Psychological returns
Profits and tax avoidance can powerfully motivate your investment selec-
tions. However, as with other life decisions, you need to consider more than
the bottom line. Some people want to have fun with their investments. Of
course, they don’t want to lose money or sacrifice a lot of potential returns —
less expensive ways to have fun do exist!
Psychological rewards compel some investors to choose particular invest-
ment vehicles such as individual stocks, real estate, or a small business.
Why? Because compared with other investments, such as managed mutual
funds, they see these investments as more tangible and . . . well, more fun.
Be honest with yourself about why you choose the investments that you do.
Allowing your ego to get in the way can be dangerous. Do you invest in indi-
vidual stocks because you really believe that you can do better than the best
full-time professional money managers? Chances are high that you won’t.

38
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

(See Chapter 6 for the details.) Do you like investing in real estate more
because of the gratification from driving by and showing off your properties
to others than because of their investment rewards? Such questions are
worth considering as you contemplate what investments you want to make.
Savings and money market 
account returns
You need to keep your extra cash that awaits investment (or an emergency)
in a safe place, preferably one that doesn’t get hammered by the sea of
changes in the financial markets. By default and for convenience, many
people keep their extra cash in a bank savings account. Although the bank
offers the U.S. government’s backing via the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC), it comes at a high price. Most banks pay a microscopic
interest rate on their savings accounts. No reason exists why you shouldn’t
earn a healthier rate of return on such savings.
A far better place to keep your liquid savings is in a money market mutual
fund. These are the safest types of mutual funds around and, for all intents
and purposes, equal a bank savings account’s safety. However, the best
money market funds pay higher yields than most bank savings accounts.
Unlike a bank, money market mutual funds tell you how much they skim off
for the cost of managing your money. If you’re in a higher tax bracket, tax-free
versions of money funds exist as well. See Chapter 8 for more on money
market funds.
If you don’t need immediate access to your money, consider using Treasury
bills (T-bills) or bank certificates of deposit, which are usually issued for
terms such as 3, 6, or 12 months. Your money will surely earn more in one of
these vehicles than in a bank savings account. The drawback to T-bills and
bank certificates of deposit is that you incur a penalty (with CDs) or a trans-
action fee (with T-bills) if you withdraw your investment before the term
expires (see Chapter 7).
Bond returns
When you buy a bond, you lend your money to the issuer of that bond (bor-
rower), which is generally the federal government or a corporation, for a spe-
cific period of time. When you buy a bond, you expect to earn a higher yield
than you can with a money market or savings account. You’re taking more
risk, after all. Companies can and do go bankrupt, in which case you may lose
some or all your investment.
39
Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns

Generally, you can expect to earn a higher yield when you buy bonds that are
 Issued for a longer term: The bond issuer is tying up your money at a
fixed rate for a longer period of time.
 Have lower credit quality: The bond issuer may not be able to repay
the principal.
Wharton School of Business professor Jeremy Siegel has tracked the perfor-
mance of bonds and stocks all the way back to 1802. Although you may say
that what happened in the nineteenth century has little relevance to the
financial markets and economy of today, the decades since the Great
Depression, which most other return data track, are a relatively small slice of
time. Figure 2-4 presents the data, so if you’d like to give more credibility to
the recent numbers, you may.
Note that although the rate of inflation has increased since the Great
Depression, bond returns have not increased over the decades. Long-term
bonds maintain slightly higher returns in recent years than short-term bonds.
The bottom line: Bond investors typically earn about 4 to 5 percent per year.
Stock returns
Let’s face it: Most people are a little greedy. (Okay, some are a lot greedy.)
People who invest in the stock market are prime examples of those who want
to make the most of a potentially good thing. Investors expect — indeed, they
demand — a fair return on investment. And if one investment doesn’t offer a
high enough rate of return, investors can choose to move their money into

other investments that they believe will perform better. Instead of buying a
sound stock and holding on to it, some investors frequently buy and sell,
hoping to cash in on the latest hot investment. This tactic seldom works out
best in the long run.
Unfortunately, some of these investors use a rearview mirror when they pur-
chase their stocks, chasing after investments that have recently performed
strongly on the assumption (and the hope) that those investments will con-
tinue to earn strong returns. But chasing after the strongest performing
investments can be dangerous if you catch the stock at its peak, ready to
begin a downward spiral. You may have heard that the goal of investing is to
buy low and sell high. Chasing high-flying investments can lead you to buy
high, with the prospect of having to sell low if the stock runs out of steam.
Even though stocks as a whole have proved to be a good long-term invest-
ment, picking individual stocks is a risky endeavor. See Chapters 5 and 6 for
advice on making sound stock investment decisions.
A tremendous amount of data exists regarding stock market returns. In fact,
in the U.S. markets, data going back more than two centuries documents the
fact that stocks are a terrific long-term investment. The long-term returns
from stocks that investors have enjoyed, and continue to enjoy, have been
remarkably constant from one generation to the next.
Going all the way back to 1802, the U.S. stock market has produced an annual
return of 8.3 percent, while inflation has grown at 1.4 percent per year. Thus,
after subtracting for inflation, stocks have appreciated about 6.9 percent
faster annually than the rate of inflation. The U.S. stock market returns have
consistently and substantially beaten the rate of inflation over the years (see
Figure 2-5).

Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns

Stocks don’t exist only in the United States, of course (see Figure 2-6). More
than a few U.S. investors seem to forget this fact, especially during the siz-
zling performance of the U.S. stock market during the late 1990s. As I discuss
earlier in the chapter, one advantage of buying and holding overseas stocks is
that they don’t always fall when U.S. stocks drop. In other words, overseas
stocks help diversify your portfolio.
In addition to enabling U.S. investors to diversify, investing overseas has
proved to be profitable. The investment banking firm Morgan Stanley tracks
the performance of stocks in both economically established countries and so-
called emerging economies. As the name suggests, countries with emerging
economies are “behind” economically but show promise of healthy rates of
growth and progress. Faster-growing countries tend to have fast-rising and
more volatile stock prices.
For example, between 1986 and 1995, Morgan Stanley’s EAFE (which stands
for Europe, Australasia, and Far East) index of foreign stocks appreciated at a
rate of 17.9 percent per year. Emerging market stocks performed even better.
This compares quite favorably with the U.S. stock market, which averaged
13.9 percent per year during this time period. Over other periods of time
(such as the latter 1990s), foreign stock returns lag U.S. stock returns.

Real estate returns
Over the years, real estate has proved to be about as lucrative as investing in
the stock market (see Chapter 11 for more details). This fact makes sense
because ultimately, growth in the economy, in jobs, and in population fuels
the demand for real estate.
Consider what has happened to the U.S. population over the past two cen-
turies. In 1800, a mere 5 million people lived within our borders. In 1900, that
figure grew to 76.1 million, and today, it’s more than 295 million. All these
people need places to live, and as long as jobs exist, the income from jobs
largely fuels the demand for housing.
Businesses and people have an understandable tendency to cluster in major
cities and suburban towns. Although some people commute, most people
and businesses locate near airports and major highways. Thus, real estate
prices in and near major metropolises and suburbs appreciate the most.
Consider the areas of the world that have the most expensive real estate
prices: Hong Kong, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Boston. What these
areas have in common are lots of businesses and people and limited land.
Contrast these areas with the many rural parts of the United States, such as
those in the Midwest and South where real estate is a veritable bargain
because of the abundant supply of buildable land and the relatively lower
demand for housing.
Small-business returns
As I discuss in Part IV of this book, you have several choices for tapping into
the exciting potential of the small-business world. If you have the drive and
determination, you can start your own small business. Or perhaps you may
have what it takes to buy an existing small business. If you obtain the neces-
sary capital and skills to assess opportunities and risk, you can invest in
someone else’s small business.
What potential returns can you get from small business? Small-business owners
like myself who do something they really enjoy will tell you that the nonfinancial
returns can be huge! The financial rewards can be handsome as well.
Every year, Forbes magazine publishes a list of the world’s wealthiest individ-
uals. Perusing this list shows that most of these people built their wealth
through a significant ownership stake from starting a small business that
became large. These individuals achieved extraordinarily high effective
43
Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns

returns (often in excess of hundreds of percent per year) on the amounts
they invested to get their companies off the ground.
You may also achieve potentially high returns from buying and improving an
existing small business. As I discuss in Part IV, such small business invest-
ment returns may be a good deal lower than the returns you may gain from
starting a business from scratch.
Unlike the stock market, where plenty of historic rate-of-return data exists,
data on the success, or lack thereof, that investors have had with investing in
small private companies is harder to come by. Smart venture capitalist firms
operate a fun and lucrative business: They identify and invest money in
smaller start-up companies that they hope will grow rapidly and eventually
go public. Venture capitalists allow outsiders to invest with them via limited
partnerships. To gain entry, you generally need $1 million to invest. (I never
said this was an equal-opportunity investment club!)
Venture capitalists, also known as general partners, typically skim off 20 per-
cent of the profits and also charge limited partnership investors a hefty 2 to 3
percent annual fee on the amount that they’ve invested. The return that’s left
over for the limited partnership investors isn’t stupendous. According to
Venture Economics, a firm that tracks limited partners’ returns over the past
15 years, venture funds have averaged annual returns of almost exactly what
stock market investors have earned on average over this same period. The
general partners that run venture capital funds make more than the limited
partners do.
You can attempt to do what the general partners do in venture capital firms
and invest directly in small, private companies. You’re quite likely to be
investing in much smaller and simpler companies. Earning venture capitalist
returns isn’t easy to do. If you think that you’re up to the challenge, I explain
the best ways to invest in small business in Chapter 15.
Considering Your Goals
How much do you need or want to earn? That may seem like an extraordinar-
ily stupid question for me to ask you! Who doesn’t want to earn a high return?
However, although investing in stocks, real estate, or small business can pro-
duce high long-term returns, you invest in these vehicles with greater risk,
especially over the short term.
44
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

Some people can’t stomach the risk. Others are at a time in their lives when
they can’t afford to take great risk. If you’re near or in retirement, your portfo-
lio and nerves may not be able to wait a decade for your riskier investments
to recover after a major stumble. Perhaps you have sufficient assets to
accomplish your financial goals and are concerned with preserving what you
do have, rather than risking it to grow more wealth.
If you work for a living, odds are that you need and want to make your invest-
ments grow at a healthy clip. If your investments grow slowly, you may fall
short of your goals of owning a home or retiring or changing careers.
45
Chapter 2: Weighing Risks and Returns
Are smaller-company stock returns higher?
Stocks are generally classified by the size of the
company. Small-company stocks aren’t stocks
that physically small companies issue — they’re
simply stocks issued by companies that haven’t
reached the size of corporate behemoths such
as IBM, AT&T, or Coca-Cola. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 index tracks the performance of 500
large-company stocks in the United States. The
Russell 2000 index tracks the performance of
2,000 smaller-company U.S. stocks.
Small-company stocks have outperformed
larger-company stocks during the past seven
decades. Historically, small-company stocks
have produced slightly higher compounded
annual returns (1.6 percent) than large-company
stocks. However, most of this extra performance
is due to just one high-performance time period,
from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. If you
eliminate this time period from the data, small
stocks have had virtually identical returns to
those of larger-company stocks.
Also, be aware that small-company stocks can
get hammered in down markets. For example,
during the Great Depression, small-company
stocks plunged more than 85 percent between
1929 and 1932, while the S&P 500 fell only 64
percent. In 1937, small-company stocks plum-
meted 58 percent; the S&P 500 fell 35 percent.
And in 1969 to 1970, small-company stocks fell
38 percent, while the S&P 500 fell just 5 percent.

efore you make any great, wealth-building investments, I recommend
that you get your financial house in order. The truth is that understand-
ing and implementing some simple personal financial management concepts
will pay off big for you in the decades ahead.
You want to know how to earn healthy returns on your investments without
getting clobbered, right? Who doesn’t? Although you generally must accept
greater risk to have the potential for earning higher returns (see Chapter 2),
in this chapter I tell you about some free lunches in the world of investing. You
have a right to be skeptical about free lunches — but this chapter points out
some easy-to-tap opportunities for managing your money you likely have
overlooked.
Establishing an Emergency Reserve
You never know what life will bring, so it makes good financial sense to have
a readily accessible reserve of cash to meet unexpected expenses. If you
have a sister who works on Wall Street as an investment banker or a loaded
and understanding parent, you can use them as your emergency reserve.
(Although you may want to ask them how they feel about that before you
count on receiving funding from them!) If not, the ball’s in your court to
establish a reserve.

Make sure that you have quick access to at least three months’ to as much as
six months’ worth of living expenses. Keep this emergency money in a high-
yielding money market fund. (See Chapter 8.) You may also be able to borrow
against your employer-based retirement account or against your home equity
should you find yourself in a bind, but these options are obviously much less
desirable.
If you don’t have a financial safety net, you may be forced into selling an
investment that you’ve worked hard for. Consider the case of Warren, who
owned his home as well as an investment property that he rented in the
Pacific Northwest. He felt, and appeared to be, financially successful. But
then Warren lost his job (a not-uncommon occurrence given corporate
America’s downsizing mood), accumulated sizable medical expenses, and
had to sell his investment property to come up with cash to tide himself over.
Warren didn’t have enough equity in his home to borrow. He didn’t have
48
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
Should you invest emergency money in stocks?
As interest rates drifted lower during the 1990s,
keeping emergency money in money market
accounts became less and less rewarding.
When interest rates were 8 or 10 percent, fewer
people questioned the wisdom of an emergency
reserve. However, in the late 1990s, with money
market interest rates of 5 percent or less and
stock market returns of 15 to 25 percent per
year, more investors balked at keeping a low-
interest stash of cash.
I began reading articles that suggested you
simply keep your emergency reserve in stocks.
After all, you can easily sell stocks (especially
those of larger companies) any day the financial
markets are open. Why not treat yourself to the
20 percent annual returns that stock market
investors enjoyed during the 1990s rather than
earning a paltry 5 percent?
I wasn’t enthusiastic about investors keeping
their emergency money invested in stocks and
clearly stated so in the second edition of this
book, which was published in 1999. I said,
“Stock market investors shouldn’t expect to
earn such generous returns as they did during
the early 1990s.” As I discuss in Chapter 2,
stocks historically have returned about 9 to 10
percent per year. In some years — in fact, about
one-third of the time — stocks decline in value,
sometimes substantially.
Stocks can drop and have dropped 20, 30, or 50
percent or more over relatively short periods of
time. Witness what happened to stock prices in
the early 2000s. Suppose that such a drop coin-
cides with an emergency — such as the loss of
your job, major medical bills, and so on. Your sit-
uation may force you to sell at a loss, perhaps a
substantial one.
Another reason not to keep emergency money
in stocks is that if your stocks appreciate and
you need to sell some of them for emergency
cash, you get stuck paying taxes on your gains.
I suggest that you invest your emergency
money in stocks (ideally through well-diversified
mutual funds) only if you have a relative or some
other resource to tap for money in an emer-
gency. Having a backup resource for money
minimizes your need to sell your stock holdings
on short notice. As I discuss in Chapter 5, stocks
are intended to be a longer-term investment, not
an investment that you expect (or need) to sell in
the near future.

other sources — a wealthy relative, for example — to borrow from either, so
he was stuck selling his investment property.
Selling some investments, such as real estate, costs big money (transaction
costs, taxes, and so on). Warren wasn’t able to purchase another investment
property and missed out on the 300-plus percent appreciation the property
earned over the subsequent two decades. Between the costs of selling and
taxes, getting rid of the investment property cost Warren about 15 percent of
its sales price. Ouch!
Evaluating Your Debts
Yes, paying down debts is boring, but it makes your investment decisions
less difficult. Rather than spending so much of your time investigating spe-
cific investments, paying off your debts (if you have them) may be your best
high-return, low-risk investment. Consider the interest rate you pay and your
investing alternatives to determine which debts you should pay off.
Conquering consumer debt
Many folks have credit-card or other consumer debt, such as auto loans, that
costs 8, 10, 12, or perhaps as much as 18-plus percent per year in interest
(some credit cards whack you with interest rates exceeding 20 percent if you
make a late payment). Reducing and eventually eliminating this debt with
your savings is like putting your money in an investment with a guaranteed
tax-free return equal to the rate that you pay on your debt.
For example, if you have outstanding credit card debt at 15 percent interest,
paying off that debt is the same as putting your money to work in an invest-
ment with a guaranteed 15 percent tax-free annual return. Because the inter-
est on consumer debt isn’t tax-deductible, you need to earn more than 15
percent investing your money elsewhere in order to net 15 percent after
paying taxes. Earning such high investing returns is highly unlikely, and in
order to earn those returns, you’d be forced to take great risk.
Consumer debt is hazardous to your long-term financial health because it
encourages you to borrow against your future earnings. I often hear people
say such things as “I can’t afford to buy most new cars for cash — look at
how expensive they are!” That’s true, new cars are expensive, so set your
sights lower and buy a good used car that you can afford. You can then invest
the money that you’d otherwise spend on your auto loan.
Borrowing via credit cards, auto loans, and the like is also one of the most
expensive ways to borrow. Banks and other lenders charge higher interest
49
Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order Before You Invest

rates for consumer debt than for debt for investments, such as real estate
and business. The reason: Consumer loans are the riskiest type of loan for a
lender.
However, using consumer debt may make sense if you’re financing a busi-
ness. If you don’t have home equity, personal loans (through a credit card or
auto loan) may actually be your lowest-cost source of small-business financ-
ing. (See Chapter 14 for more details.)
Mitigating your mortgage
Paying off your mortgage quicker is an “investment” for your spare cash that
may make sense for your financial situation. However, the wisdom of making
this financial move isn’t as clear as is paying off high-interest consumer debt;
mortgage interest rates are generally lower, and the interest is typically tax-
deductible. When used properly, debt can help you accomplish your goals —
such as buying a home or starting a business — and make you money in the
long run. Borrowing to buy a home generally makes sense. Over the long
term, homes generally appreciate in value.
If your financial situation has changed or improved since you first needed to
borrow mortgage money, you need to reconsider how much mortgage debt
you need or want. Even if your income hasn’t escalated or you haven’t inher-
ited vast wealth, your frugality may allow you to pay down some of your debt
sooner than the lender requires. Whether paying down your debt sooner
makes sense for you depends on a number of factors, including your other
investment options and goals.
Considering your investment opportunities
When evaluating whether to pay down your mortgage faster, you need to
compare your mortgage interest rate versus your investments’ rates of return
(which I define in Chapter 2). Suppose that you have a fixed-rate mortgage
with an interest rate of 7 percent. If you decide to make investments instead
of paying down your mortgage more quickly, your investments need to pro-
duce an average annual rate of return, before taxes, of about 7 percent to
come out ahead financially.
Besides the most common reason of lacking the funds to do so, other good
reasons not to pay off your mortgage any quicker than necessary include the
following:
 You instead contribute to your retirement accounts, such as a 401(k),
an IRA, or a Keogh (especially if your employer offers matching
money). Paying off your mortgage faster has no tax benefit. By contrast,
putting additional money into a retirement plan can immediately reduce
your federal and state income tax burdens. The more years you have
50
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

until retirement, the greater the benefit you receive if you invest in your
retirement accounts. Thanks to the compounding of your retirement
account investments without the drain of taxes, you can actually earn a
lower rate of return on your investments than you pay on your mortgage
and still come out ahead. (I discuss the various retirement accounts in
detail in the “Funding Your Retirement Accounts” section, later in this
chapter.)
 You’re willing to invest in more growth-oriented, volatile investments,
such as stocks and real estate. In order for you to have a reasonable
chance of earning more on your investments than it costs you to borrow
on your mortgage, you must be aggressive with your investments. As I
discuss in Chapter 2, stocks and real estate have produced annual aver-
age rates of return of about 8 to 10 percent. You can earn even more with
your own small business or investing in others’ businesses. Paying down
a mortgage ties up more of your capital, reducing your ability to make
other attractive investments. To more aggressive investors, paying off
the house seems downright boring — the financial equivalent of watch-
ing paint dry.
Remember that you have no guarantee of earning high returns from
growth-type investments, which can easily drop 20 percent or more in
value over a year or two.
 Paying down the mortgage depletes your emergency reserves.
Psychologically, some people feel uncomfortable paying off debt more
quickly if it diminishes their savings and investments. You probably
don’t want to pay down your debt if doing so depletes your financial
safety cushion. Make sure that you have access — through a money
market fund or other sources (a family member, for example) — to at
least three months’ living expenses.
Finally, don’t be tripped up by the misconception that somehow a real estate
market crash will harm you more if you pay down your mortgage. Your home
is worth what it’s worth — its value has nothing to do with your debt load.
Unless you’re willing to walk away from your home and send the keys to the
bank (also known as default), you suffer the full effect of a price decline,
regardless of your mortgage size, if real estate prices collapse.
Don’t get hung up on mortgage tax deductions
Although it’s true that mortgage interest is usually tax-deductible, don’t
forget (because if you do, you’re sure to end up in trouble with the IRS) that
you must also pay taxes on investment profits generated outside of retire-
ment accounts. You can purchase tax-free investments like municipal bonds
(see Chapter 8), but over the long haul, such bonds and other types of lend-
ing investments (bank savings accounts, CDs, and other bonds) are unlikely
to earn a rate of return that’s higher than the cost of your mortgage.
51
Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order Before You Invest

Don’t assume that those mortgage interest deductions are that great. Just 
for being a living, breathing human being, you automatically qualify for the
so-called “standard deduction” on your federal tax return. In 2005, this stan-
dard deduction was worth $5,000 for single filers and $10,000 for married
people filing jointly. If you have no mortgage interest deductions — or less
than you used to — you may not be missing out on as much of a write-off as
you think. (Not to mention that joy of having one less schedule to complete
on your tax return!)
If you earn a high income, you may not be able to fully deduct your mortgage
interest on your tax returns. If your adjusted gross income (taxable income
from all sources before subtracting itemized deductions and personal exemp-
tions) exceeds $145,950 in 2005, you start to lose some of your mortgage
interest deduction. You lose mortgage interest and other itemized deductions
by 3 percent times the amount that your adjusted gross income exceeds
$145,950. In fact, you can lose up to 80 percent of your mortgage interest
deduction. High-income couples are more likely to be affected by this provi-
sion because the $145,950 threshold is the same for couples as it is for single
filers. This rule is another part of the so-called marriage tax penalty that
you’ve perhaps heard about. (Beginning in 2006, higher-income taxpayers will
enjoy the gradual repeal of this nuisance law, which causes them to lose
some of their itemized deductions.)
Establishing Your Financial Goals
You may want to invest money for different purposes simultaneously. For
example, when I was in my 20s, I put some money away toward retirement,
but I also saved a stash so that I could hit the eject button from my job in
management consulting. I knew that I wanted to pursue an entrepreneurial
path and that in the early years of starting my own business, I couldn’t count
on an income as stable or as large as I made from consulting.
I invested my two “pots” of money — one for retirement, the other for my
small-business cushion — quite differently. As I discuss in the section
“Choosing the Right Investment Mix,” later in this chapter, you can afford to
take more risk with the money that you don’t plan on using in the near term.
So I invested the bulk of my retirement nest egg in stock mutual funds.
With the money I saved for the start-up of my small business, I took an
entirely different track. I had no desire to put this money in risky stocks —
what if the market plummeted just as I was ready to leave the security of my
full-time job? Thus, I kept this money safely invested in a money market fund
that paid a healthy rate of interest but didn’t fluctuate in value.
52
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

Making sure that your 
savings stay on track
In order to accomplish your financial and some personal goals, you need to
save money, and you need to know your savings rate. Your savings rate is the
percentage of your past year’s income that you saved and didn’t spend. You
may already know that your rate of savings is low, nonexistent, or negative
and that you need to save more.
Part of being a smart investor involves figuring out how much you need to
save to reach your goals. Not knowing what you want to do a decade or more
from now is perfectly normal — after all, your goals and needs evolve over
the years. But that doesn’t mean that you should just throw your hands in
the air and not make an effort to see where you stand today and think about
where you want to be in the future.
An important benefit of knowing your savings rate is that you’ll know better
how much risk you need to take to accomplish your goals. Seeing the amount
that you need to save to achieve your dreams may encourage you to take
more risk with your investments.
If you consistently save about 10 percent of your income during your working
years, you’re probably saving enough to meet your goals unless you want to
retire at a relatively young age. On average, most people need about 75 percent
of their pre-retirement income throughout retirement to maintain their stan-
dards of living.
If you’re one of the many people who don’t save enough, you need to do
some homework. To save more, you need to reduce your spending, increase
your income, or both.
For most people, reducing spending is the more feasible way to save. But
where do you begin? First, figure out where your money goes. You may have
some general idea, but you need to have facts. Get out your checkbook regis-
ter, credit-card bills, and any other documentation that you have of your
spending history and tally up how much you spend on dining out, operating
your car(s), paying your taxes, and everything else. After you have this infor-
mation, you can begin to prioritize and make the necessary trade-offs to
reduce your spending and increase your savings rate. Earning more income
may help boost your savings rate as well. Perhaps you can get a higher-
paying job or increase the number of hours that you work. But if you already
work a lot, reining in your spending is usually better for your emotional and
economic well-being.
53
Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order Before You Invest

If you don’t know how to evaluate and reduce your spending or haven’t
thought about your retirement goals, looked into what you can expect from
Social Security, or calculated how much you should save for retirement,
now’s the time to do it. Pick up the latest edition of my first book, Personal
Finance For Dummies (published by Wiley), and find out all the necessary
details for retirement planning and much more.
Determining your investment 
likes and dislikes
Many good investing choices exist — you can invest in real estate, the stock
market, mutual funds, your own business or someone else’s, or you can pay
down mortgage debt more quickly. What makes sense for you depends on
your goals as well as your personal preferences. If you detest risk-taking and
volatile investments, paying down your mortgage, as recommended earlier in
this chapter, may make better sense than investing in the stock market.
How would you deal with an investment that plunges 20 percent, 40 percent,
or more in a few years or less? Some of the more aggressive investments that
I discuss in this book can fall fast. (See Chapter 2 for examples.) You shouldn’t
go into the stock market, real estate, or a small-business investment arena if
such a drop is likely to cause you to sell low or make you a miserable wreck.
If you haven’t tried riskier investments yet, you may want to experiment a bit
to see how you feel with your money invested in them.
A simple way to “mask” the risk of volatile investments is to diversify your
portfolio — that is, to put your money into different investments. (See
Chapter 2.) Not watching prices closely helps, too — that’s one of the reasons
real estate investors are less likely to bail out when the market declines. Stock
market investors, unfortunately from my perspective, can get daily and even
minute-by-minute price updates. Add that fact to the quick phone call or click
of your computer mouse that it takes to dump a stock in a flash, and you have
all the ingredients for short-sighted investing — and financial disaster.
Funding Your Retirement Accounts

by forsaking the terrific tax benefits that come from investing through most

Investing as couples
You’ve probably learned over the years how
challenging it is just for you to navigate the
investment maze and make sound investing
decisions. When you have someone else to
consider, dealing with these issues becomes
doubly hard, given the typically different money
personalities and money emotions that come
into play.
In most couples with whom I’ve worked as a
financial counselor, usually one person takes
primary responsibility for managing the house-
hold finances, including investments. As with
most marital issues, the couples that do the best
job with their investments are those who com-
municate well, plan ahead, and compromise.
Here are a couple of examples to illustrate my
point. Martha and Alex scheduled meetings
with each other every three to six months to dis-
cuss financial issues. With investments, Martha
came prepared with a list of ideas, and Alex
would listen and explain what he liked or dis-
liked about each option. Alex would tend toward
more aggressive, growth-oriented investments,
whereas Martha preferred conservative, less
volatile investments. Inevitably, they would
compromise and develop a diversified portfolio
that was moderately aggressive. Martha and
Alex worked as a team, discussed options, com-
promised, and made decisions they were both
comfortable with. Ideas that made one of them
very uncomfortable were nixed.
Henry and Melisa didn’t do so well. The only
times they managed to discuss investments
were in heated arguments. Melisa often criti-
cized what Henry was doing with their money.
Henry got defensive and counter-criticized
Melisa for other issues. Much of their money lay
dormant in a low-interest bank account, and
they did little long-term planning and decision
making. Melisa and Henry saw each other as
adversaries, argued and criticized rather than
discussed, and were plagued with inaction
because they couldn’t agree and compromise.
They really needed some counseling (or a few
advice guides for couples) and a motivation to
change their behavior toward each other to
make progress with investing their money.
Aren’t your long-term financial health and mar-
ital harmony important? Don’t allow your prob-
lems to fester! Remember what the famous
psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw says about prob-
lems and making changes: “You can’t change
what you don’t acknowledge.” I couldn’t agree
more with this assessment when it comes to
money problems, including investing issues.
In my work as a financial counselor, one of the
most valuable and difficult things that I did for
couples stuck in unproductive patterns of
behavior was help them get the issue out on the
table. For these couples, the biggest step was
making an appointment to discuss their finan-
cial management. Once they did, it was rela-
tively easy for me to get them to explain their
different points of view, which enabled me to
offer compromises.

these plans are generally federal- and state-tax deductible. Suppose that you
pay about 35 percent between federal and state income taxes on your last dol-
lars of income. (To determine your tax bracket, see the section “Determining
your tax bracket,” later in this chapter.) With most of the retirement accounts
that I describe in this chapter, you can save yourself about $350 in taxes for
every $1,000 that you contribute in the year that you make your contribution.
After your money is in a retirement account, any interest, dividends, and
appreciation grow inside the account without taxation. With most retirement
accounts, you defer taxes on all the accumulating gains and profits until you
withdraw your money down the road, which you can do without penalty after
age 591⁄2. In the meantime, more of your money works for you over a long
period of time. In some cases, such as with the newer Roth IRAs described in
the “IRAs” section, later in this chapter, withdrawals are tax free, too.
The good old U.S. government now provides a tax credit for lower-income
earners who contribute up to $2,000 into retirement accounts. The maximum
credit of 50 percent applies to the first $2,000 contributed for single taxpay-
ers with an adjusted gross income (AGI) of no more than $15,000 and married
couples filing jointly with an AGI of $30,000 or less. Singles with an AGI of
between $15,000 and $16,250 and married couples with an AGI between
$30,000 and $32,500 are eligible for a 20 percent tax credit. Single taxpayers
with an AGI of more than $16,250 but no more than $25,000 and married cou-
ples with an AGI not exceeding $50,000 can get a 10 percent tax credit.
Delaying increases your pain
The common mistake that investors make is neglecting to take advantage of
retirement accounts because of their enthusiasm to spend or invest in “non-
retirement” accounts. Not investing in tax-sheltered retirement accounts can
cost you hundreds, perhaps thousands, of dollars per year in lost tax savings.
Add that loss up over the many years that you work and save, and not taking
advantage of these tax reduction accounts can easily cost you tens of thou-
sands to hundreds of thousands of dollars in the long term. Ouch!
In order to take advantage of retirement savings plans and the tax savings
that accompany them, you must first spend less than you earn. Only after
you spend less than you earn can you afford to contribute to these retire-
ment savings plans (unless you already happen to have a stash of cash from
previous savings or inheritance).
The mistake that people of all income levels make is that they don’t start
saving in retirement accounts at a younger age. The sooner you start to save,
the less painful it is each year to save enough to reach your goals because
your contributions have more years to compound.
56
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

Each decade you delay saving approximately doubles the percentage of your
earnings that you need to save to meet your goals. For example, if saving 5
percent per year in your early 20s gets you to your retirement goal, waiting
until your 30s to start may mean socking away 10 percent to reach that same
goal; waiting until your 40s, 20 percent. Beyond that, the numbers get truly
daunting.
If you enjoy spending money and living for today, you should be more moti-
vated to start saving sooner. The longer that you wait to save, the more you
ultimately need to save and, therefore, the less you can spend today!
Checking out retirement account options
If you earn employment income (or receive alimony), you have option(s) for
putting money away in a retirement account that compounds without taxa-
tion until you withdraw the money. In most cases, your contributions to
retirement accounts are tax-deductible.
Company-based plans
If you work for a for-profit company, you may have access to a 401(k) plan
that typically allows you to save up to $15,000 per year (for tax year 2006).
Many nonprofit organizations offer 403(b) plans to their employees. As with a
401(k), your contributions to 403(b) plans are federal- and state-tax deductible
in the year that you make them. Nonprofit employees can generally contribute
up to 20 percent or $15,000 of their salaries, whichever is less. In addition to
the upfront and ongoing tax benefits of such plans, some employers match
your contributions.
Older employees (defined as being at least age 50) can contribute even more
into these company-based plans — up to $20,000 in 2006. Of course, the chal-
lenge for many people is to reduce their spending enough to be able to sock
away these kinds of contributions.
If you’re self-employed, you can establish your own retirement savings plans
for yourself and any employees that you have. In fact, with all types of self-
employed retirement plans, business owners need to cover their employees
as well. Simplified employee pension individual retirement account (SEP-IRA)
and Keogh plans allow you to sock away about 20 percent of your self-
employment income (business revenue minus expenses), up to an annual
maximum of $42,000 (for tax year 2005). Each year, you decide the amount
you want to contribute — no minimums exist (unless you do a Money
Purchase Pension Plan type of Keogh). 
Keogh plans require a bit more paperwork to set up and administer than SEP-
IRAs. Unlike SEP-IRAs, Keogh plans allow vesting schedules that require
57
Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order Before You Invest

employees to remain with the company a number of years before they earn
the right to their retirement account balances. (If you’re an employee in a
small business, you can’t establish your own SEP-IRA or Keogh — that’s up to
your employer.)
If an employee leaves prior to being fully vested, his unvested balance
reverts to the remaining Keogh plan participants. Keogh plans also allow for
Social Security integration, which effectively allows those in the company
who earn high incomes (usually the owners) to receive larger-percentage
contributions for their accounts than the less highly compensated employ-
ees. The logic behind this idea is that Social Security taxes and benefits top
out after you earn $90,000 (for tax year 2005). Social Security integration
allows higher-income earners to make up for this ceiling.
Owners of small businesses shouldn’t deter themselves from keeping such a
plan because employees may receive contributions, too. If business owners
take the time to educate employees about the value and importance of these
plans in saving for the future and reducing taxes, they’ll see it rightfully as
part of their total compensation package. In addition to the vesting schedules
and Social Security integration discussed earlier in this section, many plans
allow business owners to exclude employees from receiving contributions
until they complete a year or two of service.
IRAs
If you work for a company that doesn’t offer a retirement savings plan, or if
you’ve exhausted contributing to your company’s plan, consider funding an
individual retirement account (IRA). Anyone with employment (or alimony)
income may contribute up to $4,000 each year to an IRA, or the amount of
your employment or alimony income if it’s less than $4,000 in a year. If you’re
a nonworking spouse, you’re eligible to put up to $4,000 per year into a
spousal IRA. Those age 50 and older can put away up to $5,000 per year
(effective in 2006). In 2008, the standard IRA contribution increases to $5,000
and $6,000 for those age 50 and older.
Your contributions to an IRA may or may not be tax-deductible. For tax year
2006, if you’re single and your adjusted gross income is $50,000 or less for the
year, you can deduct your full IRA contribution. If you’re married and you file
your taxes jointly, you’re entitled to a full IRA deduction if your AGI (adjusted
gross income) is $75,000 per year or less. In 2007 and beyond, these income
limits are $50,000 and $80,000, respectively. 
If you can’t deduct your contribution to a standard IRA account, consider
making a contribution to a new type of nondeductible IRA account called the
Roth IRA (or IRA Plus). Single taxpayers with an AGI less than $95,000 and
joint filers with an AGI less than $150,000 can contribute up to $4,000 per year
to a Roth IRA, $5,000 for those age 50 and older (in 2008, these limits increase
58
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

to $5,000 and $8,000, respectively). Although the contribution isn’t deductible,
earnings inside the account are shielded from taxes, and unlike a standard
IRA, qualified withdrawals from the account are free from income tax.
Annuities
If you’ve contributed all you’re legally allowed to your IRA accounts and still
want to put away more money into retirement accounts, consider annuities.
Annuities are contracts that insurance companies back. If you, the annuity
holder (investor), should die during the so-called accumulation phase (that is,
prior to receiving payments from the annuity), your designated beneficiary is
guaranteed reimbursement of the amount of your original investment.
Annuities, like IRAs, allow your capital to grow and compound tax deferred.
You defer taxes until you withdraw the money. However, unlike an IRA that
has an annual contribution limit of a few thousand dollars, you can deposit as
much as you want in any year into an annuity — even millions of dollars, if
you’ve got it! However, as with a Roth IRA, you get no upfront tax deduction
for your contributions.
Because annuity contributions aren’t tax-deductible, and because annuities
carry higher annual operating fees to pay for the small insurance that comes
with them, don’t consider contributing to one until you’ve fully exhausted
your other retirement account investing options. Because of their higher
annual expenses, annuities generally make sense only if you have 15 or more
years to wait until you need the money.
Looking into investment choices 
within retirement accounts
When you establish a retirement account, you may not realize that the retire-
ment account is simply a shell or shield that keeps the federal, state, and
local governments from taxing your investment earnings each year. You still
must choose what investments you want to hold inside your retirement
account shell.
You may invest your IRA or other self-employed plan retirement account
(SEP-IRAs, Keoghs) money into stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and even bank
accounts. Mutual funds (offered in most employer-based plans), which I
cover in detail in Chapter 8, are an ideal choice because they offer diversifica-
tion and professional management. After you decide which financial institu-
tion you want to invest through, simply obtain and complete the appropriate
paperwork for establishing the specific type of account you desire.
59
Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order Before You Invest

Taming Your Taxes
When you invest outside of tax-sheltered retirement accounts, the profits 
and distributions on your money are subject to taxation. So the type of non-
retirement account investments that makes sense for you depends (at least
partly) on your tax situation.
If you have money to invest, or if you’re considering selling current invest-
ments that you hold, taxes should factor into your decision. But tax consider-
ations alone shouldn’t dictate how and where you invest your money. You
should also weigh investment choices, your desire and the necessity to take
risk, personal likes and dislikes, and the number of years you plan to hold the
investment (see the “Choosing the Right Investment Mix” section, later in the
chapter, for more information on these other factors).
Determining your tax bracket
You may not know it, but the government charges you different tax rates for
different parts of your annual income. You pay less tax on the first dollars of
your earnings and more tax on the last dollars of your earnings. For example,
if you’re single and your taxable income totaled $50,000 during 2005, you paid
federal tax at the rate of 10 percent on the first $7,300, 15 percent on the tax-
able income above $7,300 up to $29,700, and 25 percent on income above
$29,700 up to $50,000.
Your marginal tax rate is the rate of tax that you pay on your last or so-called
highest dollars of income. In the example of a single person with taxable
income of $50,000, that person’s federal marginal tax rate is 25 percent. In
other words, he effectively pays a 25 percent federal tax on his last dollars of
income — those dollars earned between $29,700 and $50,000. (Don’t forget to
factor in state income taxes that most states assess.)
Knowing your marginal tax rate allows you to quickly calculate the following:
 Any additional taxes that you would pay on additional income
 The amount of taxes that you save if you contribute more money into
retirement accounts or reduce your taxable income (for example, if you
choose investments that produce tax-free income)
Table 3-1 shows the federal tax rates for singles and for married households
that file jointly.

Knowing what’s taxed and when to worry
Interest you receive from bank accounts and bonds is generally taxable. The
exception is the interest that some types of bonds pay. U.S. Treasury bonds,
for example, pay interest that is state-tax-free. Municipal bonds, which state
and local governments issue, pay interest that is federal-tax-free and also
state-tax-free to residents in the state where the bond is issued. (I discuss
bonds in Chapter 8.)
Taxation on your capital gains, which is the profit (sales minus purchase
price) on an investment, works under a unique system. Investments held less
than one year generate short-term capital gains, which are taxed at your
normal marginal rate. Profits from investments that you hold longer than 12
months are long-term capital gains that cap at 15 percent, except for those in
the two lowest tax brackets of 10 and 15 percent, for whom the long-term
capital gains tax rate is just 5 percent.
Use these strategies to reduce the taxes on investments exposed to taxation:
 Use tax-free money markets and bonds. If you’re in a high enough tax
bracket, you may find that you come out ahead with tax-free invest-
ments. Tax-free investments yield less than comparable investments that
produce taxable earnings, but because of the tax differences, the earn-
ings from tax-free investments can end up being greater than what tax-
able investments leave you with. In order to compare properly, subtract
what you will pay in federal as well as state taxes from the taxable
investment to see which investment nets you more.
 Invest in tax-friendly stock funds. Index funds are mutual funds that
invest in a relatively fixed portfolio of securities, such as stocks and
61
Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order Before You Invest

bonds. They don’t attempt to beat the market. Rather, they invest in the
securities to mirror or match the performance of an underlying index,
such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 (which I discuss in Chapter 5).
Although index funds can’t beat the market, they have several advan-
tages over actively managed funds. Because index funds trade less, they
tend to produce lower capital gains distributions. For mutual funds held
outside tax-sheltered retirement accounts, this reduced trading effec-
tively increases an investor’s total rate of return. See Chapter 8 to find
out more about tax-friendly stock mutual funds.
 Invest in small business and real estate. The growth in value of a busi-
ness and real estate asset isn’t taxed until you sell the asset. Even then,
with real estate you often can roll over the gain into another property as
long as you comply with tax laws. However, the current income that a
small business and real estate produce is taxed as ordinary income.
62
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 
Avoiding poor “tax saving” investments
Brokers and financial planners who work on
commission try to sell you numerous invest-
ments that they claim offer big tax advantages.
A limited partnership (LP) is a good example of
a bad investment that these salespeople push.
Limited partnerships invest in real estate and a
variety of businesses, such as cable television,
healthcare, and technology-related companies.
Although some of the companies that LPs invest
in are sound, the only sure thing about investing
in LPs is that you won’t earn the best possible
returns for your money because of high sales
commissions and ongoing management fees.
Commissions, which are immediately deducted
from your investment, can run 10 percent or
more. Annual management fees can also be
steep, running up to 3 percent per year. The best
no-load (commission-free) mutual funds, by
comparison, charge 0.2 percent to 1 percent per
year for similar investments.
LPs also have poor liquidity — you must typi-
cally wait seven to ten years until the partner-
ship investments are sold to access your
investment dollars. If you need to sell before
then, you may be able to sell through the infor-
mal secondary market, but you’ll receive pen-
nies on the dollar.
Another investment that many salespeople love
to pitch is cash-value life insurance. Life insur-
ance that combines life insurance protection
with an account that has a cash value is usually
known as universal, whole, or variable life.
Life insurance with a cash value is, at best, a
mediocre way to invest money and, at worst, a
terrible mistake, especially if you haven’t con-
tributed all that you can to your retirement
accounts. Retirement savings plans, such as
401(k)s, 403(b)s, SEP-IRAs, and Keoghs, give you
an immediate tax deduction for your current
contributions in addition to growth without tax-
ation until withdrawal.
The only real advantage that cash-value life
insurance offers is that if it’s properly held in a
trust for people who expect to have substantial
estates at their death, the proceeds paid to your
beneficiaries can be free of estate taxes. Cash-
value life insurance is one of many ways, and
generally far from the best way, to reduce your
estate tax problems. Pick up a copy of the latest
edition of Taxes For Dummies, which I co-
authored (published by Wiley), to find out more
about minimizing estate taxes.

Short-term capital gains (investments held one year or less) are taxed at your
ordinary income tax rate. This fact is another reason that you shouldn’t trade
or flip your investments quickly (within 12 months).
Choosing the Right Investment Mix
Diversifying your investments helps buffer your portfolio from being sunk by
one or two poor performers. In this section, I explain how to mix up a great
recipe of investments.
Considering your age
When you’re younger and have more years until you plan to use your money,
you should keep larger amounts of your long-term investment money in
growth (ownership) vehicles, such as stocks, real estate, and small business.
As I discuss in Chapter 2, the attraction of these types of investments is the
potential to really grow your money. The risk: The value of your portfolio can
plunge from time to time.
The younger you are, the more time your investments have to recover from a
bad fall. In this respect, investments are a bit like people. If a 30-year-old and
an 80-year-old fall on a concrete sidewalk, odds are higher that the younger
person will fully recover. Such falls sometimes disable older people.
A long-held guiding principle says to subtract your age from 110 and invest
the resulting number as a percentage of money to place in growth (owner-
ship) investments. So if you’re 35 years old:
110 – 35 = 75 percent of your investment money can be in growth 
investments.
If you want to be more aggressive, subtract your age from 120:
120 – 35 = 85 percent of your investment money can be in growth 
investments.
Note that even retired persons should still have a healthy chunk of their
investment dollars in growth vehicles like stocks. A 70-year-old person may
want to totally avoid risk, but doing so is generally a mistake. Such a person
can live another two or three decades. If you live longer than anticipated, you
can run out of money if it doesn’t continue to grow.
63
Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order Before You Invest

These tips are only general rules and apply to money that you invest for the
long term (ideally for ten years or more). For money that you need to use in
the shorter term, such as within the next several years, more-aggressive
growth investments aren’t appropriate. See Chapters 8 and 9 for more ideas.
Making the most of your 
investment options
No hard-and-fast rules exist that show you how to allocate the percentage
that you’ve earmarked for growth investments among specific investments,
like stocks and real estate. Part of how you decide to allocate your invest-
ments depends, for example, on the types of investments that you want to
focus on. As I discuss in Chapter 5, diversifying in stocks worldwide can be
prudent as well as profitable.
Here are some general guidelines to keep in mind:
 Take advantage of your retirement accounts. Unless you need accessi-
ble money for shorter-term non-retirement goals, why pass up the free
extra returns from the tax benefits of retirement accounts?
 Don’t pile into investments that gain lots of attention. Many investors
make this mistake, especially those who lack a thought-out plan to buy
stocks. In Chapter 5, I provide numerous illustrations of the perils of
buying attention-grabbing stocks.
 Have the courage to be a contrarian. No one likes to feel that he is
jumping on board a sinking ship or supporting a losing cause. However,
just like shopping for something at retail stores, the best time to buy
something is when its price is reduced and on sale.
 Diversify. As I discuss in Chapter 2, the values of different investments
don’t move in tandem. So when you invest in growth investments, such
as stocks or real estate, your portfolio’s value will have a smoother ride
if you diversify properly.
 Invest more in what you know. Over the years, I’ve met successful
investors who have built substantial wealth without spending gobs of
their free time researching, selecting, and monitoring investments. Some
investors, for example, concentrate more on real estate because that’s
what they best understand and feel comfortable with. Others put more
money in stocks for the same reason. No one-size-fits-all code exists for
successful investors. Just be careful that you don’t put all your investing
eggs in the same basket (for example, don’t load up on stocks in the
same industry that you believe you know a lot about).
64
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

 Don’t invest in too many different things. Diversification is good to a
point. If you purchase so many investments that you can’t perform a
basic annual review of them (for example, reading the annual report
from your mutual fund), you may have too many different investments.
 Be more aggressive inside retirement accounts. When you hit your
retirement years, you’ll probably begin to live off your non-retirement
account investments first. Why? For the simple reason that allowing
your retirement accounts to continue growing will save you tax dollars.
Therefore, you should be relatively less aggressive with investments out-
side of retirement accounts because that money will be invested for a
shorter time period.
Easing into riskier investments 
with dollar cost averaging
Dollar cost averaging (DCA) is the practice of investing a regular amount 
of money at set time intervals, such as monthly or quarterly, into volatile
investments, such as stocks and stock mutual funds. If you’ve ever deducted
money from a paycheck and pumped it into a retirement savings plan invest-
ment account that holds stocks and bonds, you’ve done DCA.
Most of us invest a portion of our employment compensation as we earn it,
but if you have extra cash sitting around, you can choose to invest that
money in one fell swoop or to invest it gradually via DCA. The biggest appeal
of gradually feeding money into the market via DCA is that you don’t dump all
your money into a potentially overheated investment just before a major
drop. Thus, DCA helps shy investors to psychologically ease into riskier
investments.
DCA is made to order for skittish investors with a large lump sum of money
sitting in safe investments like CDs or a savings account. For example, using
DCA, an investor with $100,000 to invest in stock funds can feed her money
into investments gradually — say, at the rate of $12,500 or so quarterly over
two years —instead of investing her entire $100,000 in stocks at once and possi-
bly buying all her shares at a market peak. Most larger investment companies,
especially mutual funds, allow investors to establish automatic investment
plans so that the DCA occurs without an investor’s ongoing involvement.
Of course, like any risk-reducing investment strategy, DCA has drawbacks. If
growth investments appreciate (as they’re supposed to), a DCA investor
misses out on earning higher returns on his money awaiting investment.
Richard E. Williams and Peter W. Bacon, finance professors at Wright State
University, found that approximately two-thirds of the time, a lump sum stock
65
Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order Before You Invest

market investor earned higher first-year returns than an investor who fed the
money in monthly over the first year. (They studied data from the U.S. market
over the past seven decades.)
However, knowing that you’ll probably be ahead most of the time if you dump
a lump sum into the stock market is little solace if you happen to invest just
before a major plunge in the stock market. In the fall of 1987, the U.S. stock
market, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, plummeted 36 per-
cent, and from 1973 to 1974, the market shed 45 percent of its value.
So investors who fear that stocks are due for such a major correction should
practice DCA, right? Well, not so fast. Apprehensive investors who shun lump
sum investments and use DCA are more likely to stop the DCA investment
process if prices plunge, thereby defeating the benefit of doing DCA during a
declining market.
So what’s an investor with a lump sum of money to do? First, weigh the signif-
icance of the lump sum to you. Although $100,000 is a big chunk of most
people’s net worth, it’s only 10 percent if your net worth is $1,000,000 and not
worth a millionaire’s time to use DCA. If the cash that you have to invest is
less than a quarter of your net worth, you may not want to bother with DCA.
Second, consider how aggressively you invest (or invested) your money. For
example, if you aggressively invested your money through an employer’s
retirement plan that you roll over, don’t waste your time on DCA.
DCA makes sense for investors with a large chunk of their net worth in cash
who want to minimize the risk of transferring that cash to riskier invest-
ments, such as stocks. If you fancy yourself a market prognosticator, you can
also assess the current valuation of stocks. Thinking that stocks are pricey
(and thus riper for a fall) increases the appeal of DCA.
Over how long a time period should you practice DCA? If you use DCA too
quickly, you may not give the market sufficient time for a correction to unfold,
during and after which some of the DCA purchases may take place. If you
practice DCA over too long a period of time, you may miss a major upswing in
stock prices. I suggest using DCA over one to two years to strike a balance.
As for the times of the year that you should use DCA, mutual fund investors
should DCA quarterly early in each calendar quarter because mutual funds
that make taxable distributions tend to do so late in the quarter.
Your money that awaits investment should have a suitable parking place.
Select a high-yielding money market fund that’s appropriate for your tax situ-
ation. With rates on money funds just shy of those on more volatile bond
funds, sitting on cash these days isn’t so bad.
66
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

One last critical point: When you use DCA, establish an automatic investment
plan so that you’re less likely to chicken out. And for the more courageous, you
may want to try an alternative strategy to DCA — value averaging, which allows
you to invest more if prices are falling and invest less if prices are rising.
Suppose that you want to value average $500 per quarter into an aggressive
stock mutual fund. After your first quarterly $500 investment, the fund drops
10 percent, reducing your account balance to $450. Value averaging has you
invest $500 the next quarter plus another $50 to make up the shortfall.
(Conversely, if the fund value had increased to $550 after your first invest-
ment, you would invest only $450 in the second round.) Increasing the
amount that you invest requires confidence when prices fall, but doing so
magnifies your returns when prices ultimately turn around.
Treading Carefully when 
Investing for College
Many well-intentioned parents want to save for their children’s future educa-
tional expenses. The mistake that they often make, however, is putting money
in accounts in their child’s name (in so-called custodial accounts) or saving
outside retirement accounts in general.
The more money you accumulate outside tax-sheltered retirement accounts,
the less assistance you’re likely to qualify for from federal and state financial
aid sources. Don’t make the additional error of assuming that financial aid is
only for the poor. Many middle-income and even some modestly affluent fam-
ilies qualify for some aid, which can include grants and loans available, even
if you’re not deemed financially needy.
Under the current financial needs analysis that most colleges use in awarding
financial aid, the value of your retirement plan is not considered an asset.
Money that you save outside retirement accounts, including money in the
child’s name, is counted as an asset and reduces eligibility for financial aid.
Also, be aware that your family’s assets, for purposes of financial aid determi-
nation, also generally include equity in real estate and businesses that you
own. Although the federal financial aid analysis no longer counts equity in
your primary residence as an asset, many private (independent) schools con-
tinue to ask parents for this information when they make their own financial
aid determinations. Thus, paying down your home mortgage more quickly
instead of funding retirement accounts can harm you financially. You may end
up with less financial aid and pay more in taxes.
67
Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order Before You Invest

Don’t forgo contributing to your own retirement savings plan(s) in order to
save money in a non-retirement account for your children’s college expenses.
When you do, you pay higher taxes both on your current income and on the
interest and growth of this money. In addition to paying higher taxes, you’re
expected to contribute more to your child’s educational expenses.
If you plan to apply for financial aid, it’s a good idea to save non-retirement
account money in your name rather than in your children’s names (custodial
accounts). Colleges expect a greater percentage of money in your child’s name
(35 percent) to be used for college costs than money in your name (6 percent).
However, if you’re affluent enough that you expect to pay for your cherub’s
full educational costs, you can save a bit on taxes if you invest through custo-
dial accounts. Prior to your child reaching age 14, the first $1,600 of interest
and dividend income is taxed at your child’s income tax rate rather than
yours. After age 14, all income that the investments in your child’s name gen-
erate is taxed at your child’s rate.
Education Savings Accounts
Hold off on putting any money into an Education Savings Account (ESA), a
relatively new savings vehicle. In theory, ESAs sound like a great place to
park some college savings. You can make nondeductible contributions of up
to $2,000 per child per year, and investment earnings and account with-
drawals are free of tax as long as you use the funds to pay for elementary and
secondary school or college costs. However, it’s still not clear enough how
college financial aid officers will treat these accounts. Funding an ESA can
undermine your child’s ability to qualify for financial aid. What we do know at
this point is that all things being equal, it’s best to keep the parents as the
owners of such account for financial aid purposes.
Section 529 plans
Also known as qualified state tuition plans, Section 529 plans offer a tax-
advantaged way to save and invest more than $100,000 per child toward col-
lege costs (some states allow upward of $250,000 per student). After you
contribute to one of these state-based accounts, the invested funds grow
without taxation. Withdrawals are also tax free so long as the funds are used
to pay for qualifying higher educational costs (which include college, gradu-
ate school, and attendance expenses of special-needs students). The schools
need not be in the same state as the state administering the Section 529 plan.
As I discuss in the previous section dealing with Education Savings Accounts,
Section 529 plan balances can harm your child’s financial aid chances. Thus,
such accounts make the most sense for affluent families who are sure that
68
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

they won’t qualify for any type of financial aid. And as with ESAs, keep par-
ents as owners of these accounts for assistance with financial aid issues.
Allocating college investments
If you keep up to 80 percent of your investment money in stocks (diversified
worldwide) with the remainder in bonds when your child is young, you can
maximize the money’s growth potential without taking extraordinary risk. As
your child makes his way through the later years of elementary school, you
need to begin to make the mix more conservative — scale back the stock per-
centage to 50 or 60 percent. Finally, in the years just before entering college,
you need to whittle the stock portion down to no more than 20 percent or so.

Chapter 3: Getting Your House in Order Before You Invest
How to pay for college
If you keep stashing away money in retirement
accounts, it’s reasonable for you to wonder how
you’ll actually pay for education expenses when
the momentous occasion arises. Even if you
have some liquid assets that can be directed to
your child’s college bill, you will, in all likelihood,
need to borrow some money. Only the affluent
can truly afford to pay for college with cash.
One good source of money is your home’s
equity. You can borrow against your home at a
relatively low interest rate, and the interest is
generally tax-deductible. Some company retire-
ment plans — 401(k)s, for example — allow bor-
rowing as well.
A plethora of financial aid programs allow you
to borrow at reasonable interest rates. The
Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and Parent Loans
for Undergraduate Students (PLUS), for exam-
ple, are available, even when your family isn’t
deemed financially needy. In addition to loans, a
number of grant programs are available through
schools and the government, as well as through
independent sources.
Complete the Free Application for Federal
Student Aid (FAFSA) to apply for the federal 
government programs. Grants available through
state government programs may require a 
separate application. Specific colleges and
other private organizations, including employ-
ers, banks, credit unions, and community
groups, also offer grants and scholarships.
Many scholarships and grants don’t require any
work on your part — simply apply for such
financial aid through your college. However, you
may need to seek out other programs — check
directories and databases at your local library,
your kid’s school counseling department, and
college financial aid offices. Also try local orga-
nizations, churches, employers, and so on
because you have a better chance of getting
scholarship money through these avenues than
through countrywide scholarship and grant
databases.
Your child can work and save money during
high school and college for school. In fact, if
your child qualifies for financial aid, she’s gen-
erally expected to contribute a certain amount
to education costs from employment (both
during the school year and summer breaks) and
from savings. Besides giving your gangly teen a
stake in her own future, this training encour-
ages sound personal financial management
down the road.

Diversified mutual funds (which invest in stocks in the United States and
internationally) and bonds are ideal vehicles to use when you invest for col-
lege. Be sure to choose funds that fit your tax situation if you invest your
funds in non-retirement accounts. See Chapter 8 for more information.
Protecting Your Assets
You may be at risk of making a catastrophic investing mistake: not protecting
your assets properly due to a lack of various insurance coverages. That’s the
error that Manny, a successful entrepreneur, made. Starting from scratch, he
built up a successful million-dollar manufacturing operation. He invested a lot
of his own personal money and sweat into building the business over 15 years.
One day, catastrophe struck: An explosion ripped through his building, and
the ensuing fire destroyed virtually all the firm’s equipment and inventory,
none of which was insured. The explosion also seriously injured several
workers, including Manny, who didn’t carry disability insurance. Ultimately,
Manny had to file bankruptcy.
Decisions regarding what amount of insurance you need to carry are, to some
extent, a matter of your desire and ability to accept financial risk. But some
risks aren’t worth taking. Don’t overestimate your ability to predict what
accidents and other bad luck may befall you. Here’s what you need to protect
yourself and your assets:
 Major medical health insurance: I’m not talking about one of those poli-
cies that pays $100 a day if you need to go into the hospital, or cancer
insurance, or that $5,000 medical expense rider on your auto insurance
policy. I know it’s unpleasant to consider, but you need a policy that
pays for all types of major illnesses and major expenditures. A $5,000
rider may pay for the first day or two in the hospital and is hardly cata-
strophic coverage. Don’t waste your money on these narrow, small-
dollar coverage policies.
 Adequate liability insurance on your home and car to guard your
assets against lawsuits: You should have at least enough liability insur-
ance to protect your net worth (assets minus your liabilities/debts) or,
ideally, twice your net worth. If you run your own business, get insur-
ance for your business assets if they’re substantial, such as in Manny’s
case. Also consider professional liability insurance to protect against a
lawsuit. You may also want to consider incorporating your business
(which I discuss more in Chapter 14).
70
Part I: Investing Fundamentals 

 Long-term disability insurance: What would you (and your family) do to
replace your income if a major disability prevents you from working?
Even if you don’t have dependents, odds are that you are dependent on
you. Most larger employers offer group plans that have good benefits and
are much less expensive than coverage you’d buy on your own. Also,
check with your professional association for a competitive group plan.
 Life insurance if others are dependent on your income: If you’re single
or your loved ones can live without your income, skip life insurance. If
you need coverage, buy term insurance that, like your auto and home
insurance, is pure insurance protection. The amount of term insurance
you need to buy largely depends on how much of your income you want
to replace.
 Estate planning: At a minimum, most people need a simple will to delin-
eate to whom they would like to leave all their worldly possessions. If
you hold significant assets outside retirement accounts, you may also
benefit from establishing a living trust, which keeps your money from fil-
tering through the hands and open wallets of probate lawyers. Living
wills and medical powers of attorney are useful to have in case you’re
ever in a medically incapacitated situation. If you have substantial
assets, doing more involved estate planning is wise to minimize estate
taxes and ensure the orderly passing of your assets to your heirs.
In my experience as a financial counselor, I’ve seen that although many people
lack particular types of insurance, others possess unnecessary policies. Many
people also keep very low deductibles. Remember to insure against potential
losses that would be financially catastrophic for you — don’t waste your
money to protect against smaller losses. (See the latest edition of my book
Personal Finance For Dummies, published by Wiley, to discover the right and
wrong ways to buy insurance, what to look for in policies, and where to get
good policies.)

o purchase and enjoy a watch, you don’t need to understand the details
of how it’s put together and works. Ditto for investing in stocks and
bonds. However, spending some time understanding how and why the finan-
cial markets function will make you more comfortable with investing and
make you a better investor.
In this chapter, I tell you the ways that companies raise capital and give you a
brief primer on financial markets and economics so that you can figure out
what you’re about to get into.
How Companies Raise Money through
the Financial Markets
Imagine that like many others, you want to run your own business. A friend of
mine, Liz, initially made necklaces and pins as a hobby. Her friends compli-
mented her on the jewelry, so she began making some for them. Eventually,
she started selling her work to local retail stores. Put yourself in Liz’s place.
Suppose that a large retail department store chain like Wal-Mart was inter-
ested in buying thousands of your necklaces and pins, and you had to con-
tract for big-time manufacturing help. Newspapers and magazines begin
featuring your work, and lots of retailers line up for your creations.

The money begins rolling in, and you’re now in the big time. At some point, 
you may want to raise more money (known as capital in the financial world) to
expand and afford your growing company’s needs, such as hiring more employ-
ees, buying computer systems, and purchasing manufacturing equipment.
Companies can choose between two major money-raising options when they
go into the financial markets: issuing stocks or issuing bonds.
Deciding whether to issue stocks or bonds
A world of difference exists between these two major securities, both from
the perspective of the investor and from that of the issuing company, as the
following explanations illustrate:
 Bonds are loans that a company must pay back. Rather than borrowing
money from a bank, many companies elect to sell bonds, which are IOUs
to investors. The primary disadvantage of issuing bonds compared with
issuing stock, from a company’s perspective, is that the company must
pay this money back with interest. On the other hand, the business doesn’t
have to relinquish ownership when it borrows money. Companies are
also more likely to issue bonds if the stock market is depressed, mean-
ing that companies can’t fetch as much for their stock.
 Stocks are shares of ownership in a company. Some companies choose
to issue stock to raise money. Unlike bonds, the money that the com-
pany raises through a stock issue isn’t paid back, because it’s not a loan.
When the public (people like you and me) buys stock, outside investors
continue to hold and trade it. (Although companies may occasionally
choose to buy their own stock back, usually because they think it’s a
good investment, they’re under no obligation to do so. If a company
does a stock buyback, the price that the company pays is simply the
price that the stock currently trades for.)
Even though a company relinquishes some of its ownership when it issues
stock, doing so allows its founders and owners to sell some of their rela-
tively illiquid private stock and reap the rewards of their successful com-
pany. Many growing companies also favor stock issues because they don’t
want the cash drain that comes from paying loans (bonds) back.
Although many company owners like to take their companies public
(issuing stock) to cash in on their stake of the company, not all owners
want to go public, and not all who do go public are happy that they did.
One of the numerous drawbacks of establishing your company as public
includes the burdensome financial reporting requirements, such as pro-
duction of quarterly earnings statements and annual reports. These doc-
uments not only take lots of time and money to produce, but they can
also reveal competitive secrets. Some companies also harm their long-
term planning ability because of the pressure and focus on short-term
corporate performance that comes with being a public company.
76
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

Companies that meet the requirements to sell stock on one of the exchanges
try to do what is in their best interests. If the stock market is booming and
new stock can sell at a premium price, companies opt to sell more stock. On
the other hand, if investors don’t believe that a company has good growth
prospects and interest rates are relatively low, the company may lean toward
selling bonds instead. Ultimately, companies seek to raise capital in the
lowest-cost way they can, so they’ll elect to sell stocks or bonds based on
what the finance folks tell them is the cheaper option.
From your perspective as a potential investor, you can usually make more
money in stocks than bonds, but stocks are generally more volatile in the
short term. (See Chapter 2 for more on stocks.)
Taking a company public: 
Understanding IPOs
Suppose that Liz’s Distinctive Jewelry wants to issue stock for the first time,
which is called an initial public offering (IPO). If Liz decides to go public, she
works with investment bankers, who, like real estate agents trying to sell homes,
help companies decide when and at what price to sell stock. (Most investment
bankers don’t like their comparison with real estate agents, but the successful
ones in both professions make big bucks earning a percentage of every deal that
they perform. Both investment bankers and real estate agents must determine
their merchandise’s asking price. Both sets of professionals also like to impress
others by driving expensive cars and dressing slickly.)
Suppose further that the investment bankers believe that Liz’s Distinctive
Jewelry can raise $20 million issuing stock. When a company issues stock,
the price per share that the stock is sold for is somewhat arbitrary. The
amount that a prospective investor will pay for a particular portion of the
company’s stock should depend upon the company’s profits and future
growth prospects. Companies that produce higher levels of profits and grow
faster can generally command a higher sales price for a given portion of the
company.
Consider the following ways that investment bankers can structure the IPO
for Liz’s Distinctive Jewelry:
Price of Stock
Number of Shares Issued
$5
4 million
$10
2 million
$20
1 million
77
Chapter 4: Looking at the Mechanics of Stock and Bond Markets

In fact, Liz’s Distinctive Jewelry can raise $20 million in an infinite number of
ways, thanks to varying stock prices. If the company wants to issue the stock
at a higher price, the company sells fewer shares.
A stock’s price per share by itself is meaningless in evaluating whether to buy a
stock. Ultimately, the amount that investors will pay for a company’s stock
should depend greatly on the company’s financial condition.
In the case of Liz’s Distinctive Jewelry, supposing that its stock outstanding in
the marketplace has a total value of $30 million and that it earned $3 per
share in the past year, here are the numbers:
In Chapter 5, I talk more about price/earnings ratios and the factors that influ-
ence stock prices.

and economy will perform in the years ahead. You can spend the rest of your
life reading all this stuff, and you still won’t get through it. In this section, I
cut to the chase and explain what you need to know about the factors that
make the financial markets and economy work so that you can make
informed investing decisions.
Uncovering the roots: Capitalism
In America, we live in a capitalistic (also known as free-market) society. Have
you ever stopped to think what that term means? Capitalism means that you
have a tremendous (although not unlimited) amount of economic freedom.

If you want to start your own business, you can. However, that’s not to say that
you don’t have to deal with obstacles, such as affording the start-up stages of
your business and dealing with regulatory red tape. Most American entrepre-
neurs tell you that one of their greatest business frustrations is dealing with
79
Chapter 4: Looking at the Mechanics of Stock and Bond Markets
What’s good and not so good about capitalism?
I came from a family that pulled itself up by its
own bootstraps. My parents didn’t have college
educations, yet they were able to own a decent
home and retire comfortably in their 60s after
many years of hard work, which included rear-
ing three children who went to Ivy League col-
leges. Despite this fact, we all turned out all
right, I think.
My brother, sister, and I are all entrepreneurs.
My brother operates a thriving veterinary clinic,
my sister operates a computer consulting 
firm, and then there’s me. I continue to do what
I love to do — train others in sound financial
management.
I feel fortunate because if I were living in a coun-
try like Russia or China, I wouldn’t be able to do
the things that I like and have the enjoyment that
my work and living in a free society bring me.
That’s the good side of capitalism — people who
have some smarts and roll up their sleeves and
work hard can carve out a standard of living that
many people around the world long for.
But like any system, capitalism includes its
warts. First, the free markets can be ruthless.
People who lack particular skills (in some cases,
through no fault of their own but because of their
lack of access to opportunities while growing
up) get left behind or worse. Famous economist
John Keynes, who is noted for clearly seeing
some of the flaws of free markets, among other
things, said, “The outstanding faults of the eco-
nomic society in which we live are its failure to
provide full employment and its arbitrary and
inequitable distribution of wealth.”
Another problem with capitalism is that left to
their own devices, some companies and their
executives seek to maximize profits and ignore
other important matters, such as ethics and the
negative impact that their business practices
may have on customers, the environment, and
so on. In describing some of the less-savory
businessmen of his time, Abraham Lincoln said
in 1837, “These capitalists generally act harmo-
niously and in concert to fleece the people.”
Some companies do bad things in the pursuit of
profits. Some opponents of any type of govern-
ment regulation seem to forget about such com-
panies. Some companies sell products that
have been proved to harm users and other inno-
cent bystanders. Tobacco, alcohol, and gun
manufacturers come to mind. Even Malcolm
Forbes, founder of one of the world’s most pro-
business, anti-big-government magazines, said,
“I’d say capitalism’s worst excess is in the large
number of crooks and tinhorns who get too
much of the action.”
But just because a company or person makes a
great amount of money compared with others
doesn’t mean that they do less good than those
who don’t make as much money. I disagree with
people such as Ayn Rand, author of The
Fountainhead, who said, “Capitalism and altru-
ism are incompatible; they are philosophical
opposites; they cannot coexist in the same man
or in the same society.” Baloney. My favorite
examples of successful capitalists are those who
succeed in business and accomplish a lot of
good: You meet some of these people later in this
book. When America is at its best as a country,
we perform both capitalism and altruism well!

all the various government agencies. In addition to the long lists of licenses
that you need to obtain for certain businesses, you may have to deal with
zoning and planning offices regarding the use of the location of your busi-
ness. You may also have to work with other state and local agencies if you
decide to incorporate, and with still more government folks to comply with
the myriad tax laws of the land.
Whine, whine, whine. Go to a socialist country if you want to see tape that’s
really red and a lack of economic opportunity and mobility. Socialism, in con-
trast to capitalism, is an economic system that its nineteenth-century promot-
ers, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, best sum up: “Abolish all private property.”
Vladimir Lenin transformed the socialist theory of Marx and Engels into a
political system known as communism. In communism, the government
largely controls and owns the organizations that provide what people need.
Over time, various countries in Europe, the former Soviet Union (Russia), and
China have tried to make communism work. However, as is old news by now,
most of these parts of the world continue to become more capitalistic.
(Please note that just as the labels Republican and Democrat are somewhat
meaningless, increasingly so too is the practice of labeling particular coun-
tries’ economies capitalistic or socialistic.) The low standard of living in com-
munist countries, long waits in lines to purchase goods, and poor health care
all contributed to the downfall of communist systems.
Driving stock prices through profits
The goal of most companies is to make money, or profits. Profits result from
the difference between what a company takes in (revenue) and what it
expends (costs). I say most companies because some organizations’ primary
purpose is not to maximize profits. Nonprofit organizations, such as colleges
and universities, are a good example. But even nonprofits can’t thrive and
prosper without a steady flow of the green stuff.
Companies that trade publicly on the stock exchanges are supposed to maxi-
mize their profit — that’s what their shareholders want. Higher profits gener-
ally make stock prices rise. Most private companies seek to maximize their
profits as well, but they retain much more latitude to pursue other goals.
So what’s the secret to maximizing profits? The key is to produce products
and services for which the demand (ideally) greatly exceeds the supply. If
you made the mistake of majoring in economics, like I did, one of the few
useful things that you learned about were supply-and-demand curves. These
important conceptual devices explain why products are priced the way that
they are and why particular companies earn the profits they do.
80
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

The following are the major ways that successful companies increase profits:
 Build a better mousetrap. Some companies develop or promote an
invention or innovation that better meets customer needs. Consider the
personal computer. In the “old days,” if you wanted to write a business
letter or report, you did it on a typewriter. Editing was a wearisome,
time-consuming process. If you made a mistake, you started the page
over or used white correction fluid. Personal computers revolutionized
the way that people write and edit their work.
Of course, computers aren’t better in all ways — you can possibly lose
an entire document because of a computer glitch. For that to happen
with your typed papers, your home has to burn to the ground or your
dog has to go on a paper-eating rampage!
 Open new markets to your products. Many successful U.S.-based com-
panies, for example, have been stampeding into foreign countries to sell
their products. Although some product adaptation is usually required to
sell overseas, selling an already proven and developed product or service
to new markets generally increases a company’s chances for success.
 Be in related businesses. Microsoft develops operating systems, such
as Windows, on which most personal computers run software. All the
computer software, such as word-processing software, must run on and
be compatible with the operating systems. Guess what — Microsoft is
also in the business of developing and selling “compatible” software.
 Build a brand name. Coca-Cola, for example, and many types of well-
known beers rate comparably in blind taste tests to many generic colas
and beers that are far cheaper. Yet consumers (perhaps you) fork over
more of their hard-earned loot because of the name and packaging.
Companies build brand names largely through advertising and other
promotions. (For Dummies is a brand name, but For Dummies books cost
about the same as lower-quality books on similar subjects!)
 Manage costs. Smart companies control costs. Lowering the cost of
manufacturing their products or providing their services allows compa-
nies to offer their products and services more cheaply. Managing costs
may help fatten the bottom line (profit). Sometimes, though, companies
try to cut too many corners, and their cost-cutting ways come back to
haunt them in the form of dissatisfied customers — or even lawsuits
based on a faulty or dangerous product.
 Watch the competition. Successful companies don’t follow the herd, but
they do keep an eye on what their competition is up to. If lots of competi-
tors target one part of the market, some companies target a less-pursued
segment that, if they can capture it, may produce higher profits thanks
to reduced competition.
81
Chapter 4: Looking at the Mechanics of Stock and Bond Markets

Weighing whether markets are efficient
Companies generally seek to maximize profits and maintain a healthy finan-
cial condition. Ultimately, the financial markets judge the worth of a company’s
stock or bond. Trying to predict what happens to the stock and bond markets
and to individual securities consumes many a market prognosticator.
In the 1960s, somewhat to the chagrin of market soothsayers, academic
scholars developed a theory called the efficient market hypothesis. This
theory basically maintains the following logic: Lots of investors collect and
analyze all sorts of information about companies and their securities. If
investors think that a security, such as a stock, is overpriced, they sell it or
don’t buy it. Conversely, if the investors believe that a security is under-
priced, they buy it or hold what they already own. Because of the competi-
tion among all these investors, the price that a security trades at generally
reflects what many (supposedly informed) people think it’s worth.
Therefore, the efficient market theory implies that trading in and out of secu-
rities and the overall market in an attempt to obtain the right stocks at the
right time is a futile endeavor. Buying or selling a security because of “new”
news is also fruitless because the stock price adjusts so quickly to this news
that investors can’t profit by acting on it. As Burton Malkiel so eloquently
said in his classic book A Random Walk Down Wall Street, this theory, “Taken
to its logical extreme . . . means that a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at
a newspaper’s financial pages could select a portfolio that would do just as
well as one carefully selected by the experts.” Malkiel added, “Financial ana-
lysts in pin-striped suits don’t like being compared with bare-assed apes.”
Some money managers have beaten the markets. In fact, beating the market
over a year or three years isn’t difficult, but few can beat the market over a
decade or more. Efficient market supporters argue that some of those who
beat the markets, even over a ten-year period, do so because of luck. Consider
that if you flip a coin five times, on some occasions you get five consecutive
heads. This coincidence actually happens, on average, once every 32 times
you do five coin-flip sequences because of random luck, not skill. Consistently
identifying in advance which sequence gives you five consecutive heads isn’t
possible.
Strict believers in the efficient market hypothesis say that it’s equally impos-
sible to identify the best money managers in advance. Some money man-
agers, such as those who manage mutual funds, possess publicly available
track records. Inspecting those track records and doing other common-sense
things, such as investing in funds that have lower expenses, improve your
odds of performing a bit better than the market.
82
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

Various investment markets differ in how efficient they are. Efficiency means
that the current price of an investment accurately reflects its true value.
Although the stock market is reasonably efficient, many consider the bond
market to be even more efficient. The real estate market is less efficient
because properties are unique, and sometimes less competition and access
to information exist. If you can locate a seller who really needs to sell, you
may be able to buy property at a discount from what it’s really worth. Small
business is also less efficient. Entrepreneurs with innovative ideas and
approaches can sometimes earn enormous returns.
One key to building wealth is to focus your time and investment strategies in
a way that reflects the realities of the investment marketplaces that you invest
in. If you desire to earn superior returns, you’re better off trying to invest on
your own in less-efficient markets like real estate and small business. On the
other hand, trying to beat the market averages and the best professionals at
picking stocks and bonds is a largely unproductive but entertaining and
addictive endeavor for some people.
Market overreactions can create buying opportunities. Efficiency notwith-
standing, the financial markets that reflect the collective forces of millions of
buyers and sellers can sometimes go to extremes. In the mid-1970s, for exam-
ple, pessimism ran rampant in this country. President Richard Nixon resigned
in disgrace, inflation and unemployment spiraled upward, and the stock
market fell out of bed. However, smart investors took advantage in this time
period. Throughout this book, I show you how to evaluate different invest-
ment markets to identify whether they’ve gone to extremes.
Moving the market: Interest rates, 
inflation, and the Federal Reserve
For decades, economists, investment managers, and other (often self-
anointed) gurus have attempted to understand the course of interest rates,
inflation, and the monetary policies set forth by the Federal Reserve. Millions
of investors follow these economic factors. Why? Because interest rates,
inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies seem to move the
financial markets and the economy.
Realizing that high interest rates are generally bad
Many businesses borrow money to expand. People like you and me, who are
affectionately referred to as consumers, also borrow money to finance home
and auto purchases and education.
83
Chapter 4: Looking at the Mechanics of Stock and Bond Markets

Interest-rate increases tend to slow the economy. Businesses scale back on
expansion plans, and some debt-laden businesses can’t afford high interest
rates and go under. Most individuals possess limited budgets as well and
have to scale back some purchases because of higher interest rates. For
example, higher interest rates translate into higher mortgage payments for
homebuyers.
If high interest rates choke business expansion and consumer spending, eco-
nomic growth slows, or the economy shrinks — and possibly ends up in a
recession. The government-sanctioned definition of a recession is two consec-
utive quarters (six months) of declining total economic output.
The stock market usually develops a case of the queasies as corporate profits
shrink. High interest rates usually depress many investors’ appetites for
stocks as the yields increase on certificates of deposit (CDs), Treasury bills,
and other bonds.
Higher interest rates actually make some people happy. If you locked in a
fixed-rate mortgage on your home or on a business loan, your loan looks
much better than if you had a variable-rate mortgage. Some retirees and
others who live off the interest income on their investments are happy with
interest rate increases as well. Consider back in the early 1980s, for example,
when a retiree received $10,000 per year in interest for each $100,000 that he
invested in certificates of deposit that paid 10 percent.
Fast-forward to the early to mid-2000s: A retiree purchasing the same CDs
saw dividend income slashed by about 70 percent, because rates on the CDs
were just 3 percent. So for every $100,000 invested, only $3,000 in interest
income was paid.
If you try to live off the income that your investments produce, a 70 percent
drop in that income is likely to cramp your lifestyle. So higher interest rates
are better if you’re living off your investment income, right? Not necessarily.
Discovering the inflation and interest rate connection
Consider what happened to interest rates in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
After the United States successfully emerged from a terrible recession in the
mid-1970s, the economy seemed to be on the right track. But within just a few
years, the economy was in turmoil again. The annual increase in the cost of
living (known as the rate of inflation) burst through 10 percent on its way to
14 percent. The explosion in oil prices, which more than doubled in less than
five years, was largely responsible for this increase. Interest rates, which are
what bondholders receive when they lend their money to corporations and
governments, followed inflation skyward.
84
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

Inflation and interest rates usually move in tandem. The primary driver of
interest rates is the rate of inflation. Interest rates were much higher in the
1980s because the United States had double-digit inflation. If the cost of living
increases at the rate of 10 percent per year, why would you, as an investor,
lend your money (which is what you do when you purchase a bond or CD) at
5 percent? Interest rates were so much higher in the early 1980s because you
or I would never do such a thing.
In recent years, interest rates have been low because inflation has declined
significantly since the early 1980s. Therefore, the rate of interest that investors
could earn lending their money dropped accordingly. Although low interest
rates reduce the interest income that comes in, the corresponding low rate of
inflation doesn’t devour the purchasing power of your principal balance.
That’s why lower interest rates aren’t necessarily worse and higher interest
rates aren’t necessarily better as you try to live off your investment income.
So what’s an investor to do, who’s living off the income he receives from his
investments but doesn’t receive enough because of low interest rates? Some
retirees have woken up to the risk of keeping all or too much of their money
in short-term CD and bond investments. Please review the sections in
Chapter 3 dealing with asset allocation and investment mix. A simple but psy-
chologically difficult solution is to use up some of your principal to supple-
ment your interest and dividend income. Using up your principal to
supplement your income is what effectively happens anyway when inflation
is higher — the purchasing power of your principal erodes more quickly. You
may also find that you haven’t saved enough money to meet your desired
standard of living — that’s why you may want to run a retirement analysis
(see Chapter 3) before you retire.
Exploring the role of the Federal Reserve
When the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, speaks, an
extraordinary number of people listen. Most financial market watchers and
the media want to know what the Federal Reserve has decided to do about
monetary policy. The Federal Reserve is the central back of the United States.
The Federal Reserve Board is comprised of the 12 presidents from the respec-
tive Federal Reserve district banks, the 7 Federal Reserve governors, and the
chairman who conducts their Federal Open Market Committee meetings
behind closed doors eight times a year.
What exactly is the Fed, as it’s known, and what does it do? The Federal
Reserve sets monetary policy. In other (perhaps clearer) words, the Fed influ-
ences interest rates levels and the amount of money or currency in circula-
tion, known as the money supply, in an attempt to maintain a stable rate of
inflation and growth in the U.S. economy.
85
Chapter 4: Looking at the Mechanics of Stock and Bond Markets

Interest rates 101
Buying money is no different from buying lettuce, computers, or sneakers. All
these products and goods cost you dollars when you buy them. The cost of
money is the interest rate that you must pay to borrow it. And the cost or
interest rate of money is determined by many factors that ultimately influ-
ence the supply of and demand for money.
The Fed, from time to time and in different ways, attempts to influence the
supply and demand for money and the cost of money. To this end, the Fed
raises or lowers short-term interest rates, primarily by buying and selling U.S.
Treasury bills on the open market. Through this trading activity, known as
open market operations, the Fed is able to target the Federal funds rate —
the rate at which banks borrow from one another overnight.
The senior officials at the Fed readily admit that the economy is quite complex
and affected by many things, so it’s difficult to predict where the economy is
heading. If forecasting and influencing markets are such difficult undertakings,
why does the Fed exist? Well, the Fed officials believe that they can have a posi-
tive influence in creating a healthy overall economic environment — one in
which inflation is low and growth proceeds at a modest pace. If the economy
expands too rapidly, inflation can escalate. On the other hand, Fed officials
believe that if the supply of money is too restricted and interest rates are too
high, businesses won’t be able to borrow and expand, and the economy will
stagnate or, worse, actually shrink. So the Fed tries to keep everything just right!
Over the years, the Fed has come under attack for various reasons. Yale econ-
omist Edward Tufte’s controversial book Political Control of the Economy
argued that the Federal Reserve would, with a nudge of encouragement from
the president, goose the economy. The Fed gooses the economy by loosening
up on the money supply, which leads to a growth spurt in the economy and a
booming stock market, just in time to make El Presidente look good prior to
an election. Conveniently, the consequences of inflation take longer to show
up — not until after the election. In recent years, others have questioned the
Fed’s ability to largely do what it wants without accountability.
The Greenspan obsession
Perhaps you’ve read headlines that speculate about and document the
Federal Reserve’s moves to influence interest rates, inflation, and the econ-
omy. The stock market cable television channels are especially guilty of fol-
lowing every utterance that comes from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan’s
mouth and trying to link the stock market’s subsequent performance to what
Greenspan said or didn’t say.

Chapter 4: Looking at the Mechanics of Stock and Bond Markets
Fed chiefs can invest with few restrictions
If Federal Reserve officials do have some
insight into future interest rates and economic
policy, wouldn’t you like to know how the senior
Fed officials invest their own personal money
and when they refinance their mortgages and
what type of mortgages they get? Inquiring
minds like to know, and I was curious, so I
started asking some questions.
Getting Fed officials, who don’t generally see
themselves as part of the government or
accountable to the public, to return phone calls
is a challenge. But persistence pays off. Bob
Parry, president and CEO of one of the regional
Federal Reserve banks, said to me of his invest-
ments, “It’s pretty boring stuff. I don’t have time to
do research on individual securities, so I use
mutual funds.” Specifically, Parry says that he
uses a lot of index funds (see Chapter 8), that
hold a relatively fixed basket of stocks or bonds
that mirror a broad market index, like the
Standard & Poor’s 500 index. Another Fed official
with whom I spoke also says he uses index funds
because, as a former stock and bond analyst, he
learned that “You can’t easily beat the market.”
Somewhat to my surprise, I discovered that the
top brass at the Fed have few restrictions on the
types of investments that they may hold and
when they can trade. The government prohibits
Fed employees from owning individual stocks or
bonds of banks or dealers in government securi-
ties and investing in government bonds. But no
specific prohibitions prevent Fed officials, for
example, from dumping their bond holdings if
they think that interest rates are set to rise, load-
ing up on them if the Fed enters a period of freer
credit, or dumping stocks and bonds altogether.
Interestingly, most senior Fed officials come into
the Fed from the private sector, where they
were forecasters. Greenspan, for example, was
a partner in the Townsend and Greenspan eco-
nomic forecasting firm. Surprisingly, despite
earning a living for their predictions, most Fed
officials dismiss their forecasting abilities after
they join the Fed.
Some financial market pundits say not to under-
estimate the role of the Fed and its ability to
signal its interest rate intentions to the financial
markets. Others see the Fed as possessing less
and less influence on the increasingly global
financial markets and economy. Ultimately, some
financial market pundits say that supply and
demand, not the Fed, determine interest rates.
How much Fed officials can divine the future
remains an open question. If you can figure out
a system for timing your investments and trying
to buy and sell based on publicly available infor-
mation and anticipated Federal Reserve moves,
you should be a professional money manager! I
don’t know whether Fed officials, who are privy
to inside information, have been able to profit
from their inside knowledge, but it seems pru-
dent for them to set up safeguards to prevent
such an occurrence or the likely outcry about
the uncovering of past occurrences. Requiring
public disclosure of their personal trades, as
corporate executives must do when they trade
their own companies’ stock, is one solution.
Another solution is for Fed officials to place their
investments in a blind trust during their years of
work at the Fed, as other senior government
officials must do.

If you’ve ever heard Fed officials speak, you know that they’re always coy about
tipping their hands, and they rarely give specifics, even when they testify
before Congress. Greenspan is widely considered to be a master of such
verbal obfuscation. Most people can’t understand half of the (often run-on)
sentences that this man speaks!
Here’s a classic example of something that Greenspan said in a speech and
that the media blew out of proportion:
Clearly, sustained low inflation implies less uncertainty about the future,
and lower risk premiums imply higher prices of stocks and other earning
assets. We can see that in the inverse relationship exhibited by price/
earnings ratios and the rate of inflation in the past. But how do we know
when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which
then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they
have in Japan over the past decade? And how do we factor that assess-
ment into monetary policy? We as central bankers need not be concerned
if a collapsing financial asset bubble does not threaten to impair the real
economy, its production, jobs, and price stability.
(I’m sure that you’re grateful that Mr. Greenspan hasn’t been retained to write
Fed Policy Explained For Dummies!) Many in the media quickly focused on the
sound bite “irrational exuberance” and linked it to the stock market. The
morning after Greenspan’s speech, stock prices dropped sharply, and the
same media attributed the drop to — you guessed it — his “irrational exuber-
ance” comment. Turns out that investors who sold when Greenspan made
this speech in early December 1996 at the American Enterprise Institute for
Public Policy kicked themselves, because stock prices subsequently soared.
Many, many factors influence the course of stock prices. Never, ever make a
trade or investment based upon what someone at the Federal Reserve says
or what someone in the media or some market pundit reads into the com-
ments. The Fed simply doesn’t have that much power or influence over the
future. You need to make your investment plans based on your needs and
goals, not what the Fed does or doesn’t do.

T
he stock market may seem mysterious — it contains lots of jargon and
supposed experts. When you want to buy stocks, you generally need a
broker, and you may have heard about how you can seem like shark bait to
these commission-hungry folks. Brokers, the firms that employ them, and
financial advisors possess many conflicts of interest. Most of them want to
make the stock market seem complicated so that would-be investors must
come to them for help. If you understand the market and realize that their
crystal ball has more than a few cracks in it, you can find better ways to
invest your money in the stock market that don’t require their services.
Some people liken investing in the stock market to gambling. A real casino
structures its games — slot machines, poker, roulette, and so on — so that in
aggregate, the casino owners siphon off a healthy slab (40 percent) of the
money that people bring with them. The vast majority of casino patrons lose
money, in some cases all of it. The few who leave with more money than they
came with are usually people who are lucky and are smart enough to quit
while they’re ahead.
I can understand why some individual investors, perhaps you, feel that the
stock market resembles legalized gambling. So why bother with the stock
market if it’s so confusing and filled with people who are eager to separate
you from your money? In Chapter 2, I discuss the potential risks and rewards
of different investments. Shares of stock, which represent portions of owner-
ship in companies, offer a way for people of modest and wealthy means, and
everybody in between, to invest in companies and build wealth.

Fortunately, the stock market isn’t a casino — far from it. History shows that
nearly all long-term investors can win in the stock market because it appreci-
ates over the years. I say nearly because even some people who remain active
in the market over many years manage to lose some money because of easily
avoidable mistakes, which I can keep you from making in the future.
R. Foster Winans, a former writer for Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal,
said, “The only reason to invest in the market is because you think you know
something others don’t.” Mr. Winans, who was later convicted of insider trad-
ing, was wrong in more ways than one. You don’t need any inside information
to profit from stock investments. You simply need to understand this basic
concept: The increasing profits that expanding companies produce ultimately
propel stock prices higher. The trajectory path isn’t a straight line up, but
more like the path that a small bird takes when it fights to gain altitude in a
fierce headwind. Although the bird sometimes hits an air pocket or spot of
bad weather and loses some altitude, the bird’s aerodynamics win out. How
many birds have you seen crash to the ground?
The same theory applies with corporate profits. Corporate profits also tend
to trend up, but sometimes the economy hits a bad patch and profits fall. As
with the bird, economies don’t usually get completely decimated. Yes, it’s
possible that if a huge meteor smashes into Earth or a horrible, contagious
virus spreads like wildfire, society may be done for — people and companies
may cease to exist and make a profit. In the meantime, why not share in the
expansion of the economy and keep an optimistic view on life?
Taking Stock of How You Make Money
When you purchase a share of a company’s stock, you can profit from your
ownership in two ways:
 Dividends: First, most stocks pay dividends. Companies ideally make
some profits during the year. Some high-growth companies reinvest most
or all their profits right back into the business. Many companies, however,
pay out some of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends.
 Appreciation: When the price per share of your stock rises to a level
greater than you originally paid for it, you make money. This profit, how-
ever, is only on paper until you sell the stock, at which time you realize a
capital gain. Of course, the stock price per share can fall below what you
originally paid, at which point you lose money.
90
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

If you add together dividends and appreciation, you arrive at your total return.
Stocks differ in the dimensions of these possible returns, particularly with
respect to dividends. Utility companies, for example, tend to pay out more of
their profits as dividends. But don’t buy utility stocks thinking that you’ll
make more money because of the heftier dividends. Utilities and other compa-
nies paying high dividends tend not to appreciate as much over time because
they don’t reinvest as much in their businesses, and they’re not growing.
Defining “The Market”
So you invest in stocks to share in the spoils of capitalistic economies. When
you invest in stocks, you do so through the stock market. What is the stock
market? Everybody talks about “The Market” the same way they do the
largest city nearby (“The City”):
The Market is down 137 points today.
With The Market hitting new highs, isn’t now a bad time to invest?
The Market seems ready for a fall.
When people talk about The Market, they’re usually referring to the U.S.
stock market. Even more specifically, they’re speaking about the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, created by Charles Dow and Eddie Jones. Dow and
Jones, two reporters in their 30s, started publishing a paper that you may
have heard of — The Wall Street Journal — in 1889. Like its modern-day ver-
sion, the nineteenth-century Wall Street Journal reported current financial
news. Dow and Jones also compiled stock prices of larger, important compa-
nies and created and calculated indexes to track the performance of the U.S.
stock market.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) market index tracks the perfor-
mance of 30 large companies that are headquartered in the United States.
The Dow 30 includes companies such as telecommunications giants SBC
Communications and Verizon Communications; airplane manufacturer
Boeing; soda maker Coca-Cola; oil giant Exxon Mobil; automaker General
Motors; technology behemoths IBM, Intel, and Microsoft; fast-food king
McDonald’s; and retailers Home Depot and Wal-Mart.
Some criticize the Dow index for encompassing so few companies and for a
lack of diversity. The 30 stocks that make up the Dow aren’t the 30 largest or
the 30 best companies in America. They just so happen to be the 30 compa-
nies that senior staff members at The Wall Street Journal think reflect the
diversity of the economy in the United States. The 30 stocks in the Dow
change over time as companies merge, decline, and rise in importance.
91
Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks

Looking at major stock market indexes
Just as Manhattan isn’t the only city to visit or live in, the 30 stocks in the
Dow Jones Industrial Average are far from representative of all the different
types of stocks that you can invest in. Here are some other important market
indexes and the types of stocks that they track:
 Standard & Poor’s 500: Like the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P
500 tracks the price performance of 500 larger-company U.S. stocks.
These 500 big companies account for about 70 percent of the total
market value of the tens of thousands of stocks traded in the United
States. Thus, the S&P 500 is a much broader and more representative
index of the larger-company stocks in the United States than is the Dow
Jones Industrial Average.
Unlike the Dow index, which is largely calculated by adding the current
share price of each of its component stocks, the S&P 500 index is calcu-
lated by adding the total market value (capitalization) of its component
stocks. To impress your friends and colleagues, you can tell them that
the S&P 500 is a capitalization-weighted index.
 Russell 2000: This index tracks the performance of 2,000 smaller U.S.
company stocks of varying industries. Although small-company stocks
tend to move in tandem with larger-company stocks over the longer
term, it’s not unusual for one to rise or fall more than the other or for
one index to fall while the other rises in a given year. For example, in
2001, the Russell 2000 actually rose 2.5 percent while the S&P 500 fell
11.9 percent. Be aware that smaller-company stocks tend to be more
volatile (I discuss this in more detail in Chapter 2).
 Wilshire 5000: Despite its name, the Wilshire 5000 index actually tracks
the prices of more than 6,500 stocks of U.S. companies of all sizes —
small, medium, and large. Thus, many consider this index the broadest
and most representative of the overall U.S. stock market.
 Morgan Stanley EAFE: Stocks don’t exist only in the United States.
Morgan Stanley’s EAFE index (EAFE stands for Europe, Australasia, and
Far East) tracks the prices of stocks in the other major developed coun-
tries of the world.
 Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets: This index follows the price move-
ments of stocks in the less economically developed but “emerging”
countries, which usually concentrate in Southeast Asia and Latin
America. These stock markets tend to be more volatile than those in
established economies. During good economic times, emerging markets
usually reward investors with higher returns, but stocks can plunge far-
ther and faster than stocks in developed markets.
92
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

Conspicuously absent from this list of major stock market indexes is the
NASDAQ index. With the boom in technology stock prices in the late 1990s,
CNBC and other financial media started broadcasting movements in the 
technology-laden NASDAQ index, thereby increasing investor interest and the
frenzy surrounding technology stocks. (See the section later in this chapter
titled “The Internet and technology bubble.”) I’m not a fan of sector (indus-
try) specific investing; it undermines diversification and places you in the
role of a professional money manager in having to determine when and how
much to invest in specific industry groups. I suggest ignoring the NASDAQ as
well as other industry-concentrated indexes.
Counting reasons to use indexes
Indexes serve several purposes. First, they can quickly give you an idea of
how particular types of stocks fare and perform in comparison with other
types of stocks. In 1998, for example, the S&P 500 was up 28.6 percent,
whereas the small-company Russell 2000 index was down 2.5 percent. That
same year, the Morgan Stanley foreign stock EAFE index rose 20.3 percent. In
2001, by contrast, the S&P 500 fell 11.9 percent, and the EAFE foreign stock
index had an even worse year — falling 21.4 percent.
93
Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
Recognizing bull and bear markets
If you read magazines or newspapers or listen
to people talk about the stock market, you often
hear references to bull markets and bear mar-
kets. You may know which term means a good
market and which term means a bad market for
investors, but even if you do, you may wonder
where these silly terms came from.
It’s hard to find agreement on the origin of these
terms, but my favorite description comes from
Robert Claiborne’s Loose Cannons and Red
Herrings — A Book of Lost Metaphors. The term
bear, according to Claiborne, originates from a
proverb that mocks a man who “sells the
bearskin before catching the bear.” This is the
connection to the stock market: When dealers
in the stock market thought that the market
became too pricey and speculative, these deal-
ers sold stock that they hadn’t yet “caught”
(bought). These dealers were labeled “bearskin
jobbers” and, later, “bears.”
The practice that these bearish dealers
engaged in is short selling. They hoped that
when they ultimately bought the stock that they
had first sold, they could buy it back at a lower
price. Their profit was the difference between
the price that they originally sold it for and what
they later bought it for. Short selling is simply
investing in reverse: You sell first and buy back
later. The worst situation for a bear is if prices
go up, and she must buy back the stock at a high
price. As Claiborne said, “He who sells what
isn’t his’n, must buy it back or go to prison.”
The bulls, according to Claiborne, are those
who work the “other side” of the street. Bulls
buy stocks with the hope and expectation that
they will rise in value. Ben Travato, a man whom
Claiborne describes as one prone to inventing
colorful, but often inaccurate, etymologies, said
that bulls toss stocks up in the air with their
horns.

Indexes also allow you to compare or benchmark the performance of your
stock market investments. If you invest primarily in large-company U.S. stocks,
for example, you should compare the overall return of the stocks in your 
portfolio to a comparable index — in this case, the S&P 500. (As I discuss in
Chapter 8, index mutual funds, which invest to match a major stock market
index, offer a cost-effective, proven way to build wealth by investing in stocks.)
As I explain in the section “Looking at major stock market indexes,” earlier
in this chapter, you may also hear about some other types of more narrowly
focused indexes, including those that track the performance of stocks in par-
ticular industries, such as advertising, banking, computers, pharmaceuticals,
restaurants, semiconductors, textiles, and utilities. Other countries, such as
Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada, and Hong Kong, pos-
sess stock indexes that track the performance of their own stock markets.
Focusing on your investments in the stocks of just one or two industries or
smaller countries is dangerous due to the lack of diversification and your
lack of expertise in making the difficult decision about what and when to
invest in. Thus, I suggest that you ignore these narrower indexes. Many com-
panies, largely out of desire for publicity, develop their own indexes. If the
news media report on these indexes, the index developer effectively obtains
free advertising. (In Chapter 8, I discuss investing strategies, such as those
that focus upon value stocks or growth stocks, which also have market
indexes.)
Stock Buying Methods
When it comes to investing in stocks, many (perhaps too many) choices
exist. Besides the tens of thousands of stocks among which you can select,
you can hire a mutual fund manager or stockbroker to pick for you.
Buying stocks via mutual funds
If you’re busy and suffer no delusions about your expertise, you’ll love the
best stock mutual funds. Investing in stocks through mutual funds can be as
simple as dialing a toll-free phone number or logging onto a fund company’s
Web site, obtaining and completing some application forms, and mailing a
check.
Mutual funds are investment companies that invest money from people like
you and me in securities, such as stocks and bonds. Stock mutual funds, as
the name suggests, invest primarily or exclusively in stocks (some “stock”
funds sometimes invest a bit in other stuff, such as bonds).
94
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

Stock mutual funds include many advantages:
 Diversification: Buying individual stocks on your own is relatively costly
unless you buy reasonable chunks (100 shares or so) of each stock. But
in order to buy 100 shares each in, say, a dozen companies’ stocks to
ensure diversification, you need about $60,000 if the stocks that you buy
average $50 per share.
 Professional management: Even if you have big bucks to invest, mutual
funds offer something that you can’t deliver: professional, full-time man-
agement. Look at it this way: Mutual funds are a huge time-saver. It’s
Friday night — would you rather go to the local library and do some
research on semiconductor and toilet paper manufacturers or enjoy
dinner or a movie with family and friends? (I guess that the answer to
that question depends on who your family and friends are!)
Mutual fund managers peruse a company’s financial statements and 
otherwise track and analyze a company’s business strategy and market
position. The best managers put in long hours and possess lots of exper-
tise and experience in the field. (If you’ve been misled into believing that
with minimal effort you can rack up market-beating returns by selecting
your own stocks, please be sure to read the rest of this chapter.)
 Low costs — if you pick ’em right: To convince you that mutual funds
aren’t a good way for you to invest, those with a vested interest, such as
stock-picking newsletter pundits, may point out the high fees that some
funds charge. An element of truth rings here: Some funds are expensive,
charging you a couple percent or more per year in operating expenses
on top of hefty sales commissions.
But just as you wouldn’t want to invest in a fund that a novice with no
track record manages, why would you want to invest in a high-cost fund?
Contrary to the “You get what you pay for” notion often trumpeted by
those trying to sell you something at an inflated price, some of the best
managers are the cheapest to hire. Through a no-load (commission-free)
mutual fund, you can hire a professional, full-time money manager to
invest your $10,000 for a mere $20 to $100 per year. And if you have far
less than this to invest, they’ll still invest your money at a low cost: $2 to
$10 per year if you invest $1,000.
As with all investments, mutual funds have drawbacks. The issue of control
is a problem for some investors. If you’re a controlaholic, turning over your
investment dollars to a seemingly black-box process where others decide
when and in what to invest your money may unnerve you. However, you need
to be more concerned about the potential blunders that you may make
investing in individual stocks of your own choosing or, even worse, those
stocks pitched to you by a broker.
95
Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks

Taxes are another concern when you invest in mutual funds outside retirement
accounts. Because the fund manager, and not you, decides when to sell specific
stock holdings, some funds may produce relatively high levels of taxable distri-
butions. Fear not — simply select tax-friendly funds if taxes concern you.
In Chapter 8, I discuss investing in the best mutual funds that offer a time-
and cost-efficient, high-quality way to invest in stocks worldwide.
Selecting individual stocks
More than a few investing books suggest and enthusiastically encourage
people like you to do their own stock picking. However, the vast majority of
people are better off not picking their own stocks.
Why do I make this statement? Not because I don’t think highly of you and your
capabilities; I do. I’ve long been an advocate of people educating themselves
and taking responsibility for their own financial affairs, but taking responsibil-
ity for your own finances doesn’t mean that you should do everything yourself.
Table 5-1 includes some thoughts to consider about choosing your own stocks.

Several popular investing books try to convince investors that they can

stock selection. Many professional investors work 80 hours a week at invest-
ing, but it’s unlikely that you’re willing to spend that much time on it. Don’t
let the popularity of those do-it-yourself stock picking books lead you astray.
96
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

A Midwest investment club that claims to have beaten the market’s returns
by a wide margin wrote an investing book, The Beardstown Ladies’ Common-
Sense Investment Guide (Hyperion). This club’s philosophy is to invest in
companies whose businesses you are familiar with and you can understand.
(I discuss this book in Chapter 18.) However, such a simplistic investing
approach can lead you to poor stock picks.
Although industry familiarity can, at times, supplement your choice of stocks,
it’s dangerous to base your investment decisions solely on your own knowl-
edge and gut feelings. Allow me to introduce you to a company that attracted
many people through this approach: Fresh Choice. The idea, and the restau-
rants based on it, is simple and understood by many. You enter the restaurants,
which originated in California, and walk down a self-serve line, which offers
salads and other fresh choices. A pasta bar, soups, breads, and even a self-
service dessert bar greet hungry eyes. It’s all you can eat for about seven
bucks, and because it’s self-serve, you don’t tip.
Fresh Choice went public with the cute trading symbol SALD. In its early
months, it traded at around $23 per share, which represented a multiple of
nearly 60 times earnings (P/E) — a whopping figure. For more on the price-to-
earnings ratio, see “Calculating price/earnings ratios,” later in the chapter.
Brokerage analysts, many of whom work for firms that sold shares in Fresh
Choice’s initial public offering (IPO), engaged in a love fest over the stock.
Almost every Wall Street analyst who followed the stock recommended
buying it in the years following the IPO, during which time its stock price
bounced around between $25 to $30 per share while earnings steadily grew:
 Montgomery Securities said to “buy.”
 Morgan Grenfell called it a “must own.”
 Dain Bosworth said to “buy.”
 Rauscher Pierce Refsnes rated it a “buy” and one of its “two favorite
picks” in the restaurant business. The firm said that the company was
“uniquely positioned” and had a “unique concept.”
 Seidler said, “We are excited by the growth prospects for Fresh Choice,
and we project a five-year earnings per share growth rate of 35 percent.
We believe the stock represents a good value.”
 Lead underwriter Alex Brown rated it a “strong buy” and said of Fresh
Choice, “An excellent company and an exciting concept.”
Less than two years after going public, some major problems became appar-
ent. Fresh Choice’s expansion plan was poorly managed. Some new restau-
rants opened too close to existing ones and cannibalized sales. Even those
new locations that weren’t close seemed to cannibalize sales — it seemed
that people who liked the idea had been driving a good distance to existing
stores.
97
Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks

A warning sign that these analysts and investors should’ve heeded was that
Fresh Choice refused to release same-store sales (how sales had changed at
stores open during the same reporting period a year ago), which would have
allowed dissection of sales growth from existing stores versus the new loca-
tions that were opening. It’s easy for an expanding company to increase sales
by simply opening new locations. Meanwhile, existing locations can suffer
declining revenue that is masked in the company’s aggregate revenue figures.
This is what happened at Fresh Choice.
Also, outside the confines of California, the chain met with an audience that
wasn’t as attuned to the type of food that Fresh Choice specialized in. The all-
you-can-eat format, not surprisingly, attracted bigger eaters. People looking
for less food, as many health-conscious eaters do, stayed away. As people
tired of the same menu, the stores had difficulty retaining repeat customers.
As the company’s profits sank, so did the stock price. From a high of $321⁄2,
Fresh Choice’s stock price plunged 84 percent in the next year, and the com-
pany eventually landed in bankruptcy.
Although it may seem that I’m trying to scare you away from buying individ-
ual stocks, I’m not. But choosing a stock isn’t as simple as visiting a restau-
rant chain, liking it, and then sitting back and getting rich watching your
stock zoom to the moon. And as Fresh Choice and scores of other company
cases illustrate, analyst stock recommendations aren’t generally worth the
paper they’re printed on.
If you invest in stocks, I think that you know by now that guarantees don’t
exist. But as in many of life’s endeavors, you can buy individual stocks in
good and not-so-good ways. In Chapter 6, I explain how to research and trade
individual stocks.
Spotting the Best Times to Buy and Sell
Now that you know about the different types of stock markets and ways to
invest in stocks, you may wonder how you can build wealth with stocks and
not lose your shirt. Nobody wants to buy stocks before the markets take a big
drop (which I discuss in Chapter 2). Thousands of books have been written
about how to get rich in the stock market by buying the best stocks cheaply
and selling them when they become expensive.
As I discuss in Chapter 4, the stock market is reasonably efficient. A company’s
stock price normally reflects many smart people’s assessments as to what is a
fair price. Thus, it’s not realistic for an investor to expect to discover a system
for how to “buy low and sell high.”
98
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

A few rare professional investors may obtain an ability for spotting good
times to buy and sell particular stocks, but consistently doing so is enor-
mously difficult. In fact, the investing public doesn’t possess a great track
record with buying low and selling high. Smaller investors tend to sell heavily
after major declines and step up buying after major price increases.
The simplest and best way to make money in the stock market is to consis-
tently and regularly feed new money into building a diversified and larger
portfolio. If the market drops, you can use your new investment dollars to
buy more shares. The danger of trying to time the market is that you may be
“out” of the market when it appreciates greatly and “in” the market when it
plummets.
Calculating price/earnings ratios
Suppose I tell you that Liz’s Distinctive Jewelry’s stock sells for $50 per share
and another stock in the same industry, The Jazzy Jeweler, sells for $100.
Which would you rather buy?
If you answer, “I don’t have a clue because you didn’t give me enough infor-
mation,” go to the head of the class! On its own, the price per share of stock
is meaningless.
Although The Jazzy Jeweler sells for twice as much per share, its profits
might also be twice as much per share — in which case, The Jazzy Jeweler
stock price may not be out of line given its profits. The level of a company’s
stock price relative to its earnings or profits per share helps you calibrate
how expensively, cheaply, or fairly a stock price is valued.
Over the long term, stock prices and corporate profits tend to move in sync,
like good dance partners. The price/earnings (P/E) ratio (say “P E” — the “/”
isn’t pronounced) compares the level of stock prices to the level of corporate
profits, giving you a good sense of the stock’s value. Over shorter periods of
time, investors’ emotions as well as fundamentals move stocks, but over
longer terms, fundamentals possess a far greater influence on stock prices.
P/E ratios can be calculated for individual stocks as well as entire stock mar-
kets. Use this practical example to see how you can apply the use of P/E ratios.
Stock Price Per Share
Annual Earnings Per Share
= Price-earnings (P/E) ratio
99
Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks

A particular price level in and of itself is meaningless, like a given stock (such
as IBM) that rises above a specific price (such as $100 per share). The level of
a stock’s price, or a stock market index, is important and meaningful when
you compare it with earnings for the company or companies in the stock
market index.
Over the past 100-plus years, the P/E ratio of U.S. stocks has averaged around
15. During times of low inflation, the ratio has tended to be higher — in the
high teens to low twenties. As I cautioned in the second edition of this book,
published in 1999, the P/E ratio for U.S. stocks got into the thirties, well above
historic norms even for a period of low inflation. Thus, the down market that
began in 2000 wasn’t surprising, especially given the fall in corporate profits
that put even more pressure on stock prices.
Just because U.S. stocks have historically averaged P/E ratios of about 15
doesn’t mean that every individual stock will trade at such a P/E. Here’s why:
Suppose that you have a choice between investing in two companies, Superb
Software, which makes computer software, and Tortoise Technologies, which
makes typewriters. If both companies’ stocks sell at a P/E of 15 and Superb
Software’s business and profits grow 40 percent per year and Tortoise’s busi-
ness and profits remain flat, which would you buy?
Because both stocks trade at a P/E of 15, Superb Software appears to be the
better buy. Even if Superb’s stock continues to sell at 15 times the earnings,
its stock price should increase 40 percent per year as its profits increase.
Faster-growing companies usually command higher price/earnings ratios.
Just because a stock price or an entire stock market seems to be at a high
price level doesn’t necessarily mean that the stock or market is overpriced.
Always compare the price of a stock to that company’s profits per share or
the overall market’s price level to overall corporate profits. The price/earn-
ings ratio captures this comparison. Faster-growing and more-profitable com-
panies generally sell for a premium — higher P/E ratios. Also remember that
future earnings, which are difficult to predict, influence stock prices more
than current earnings, which are old news.
Citing times of speculative excess
Because the financial markets move as much on the financial realities of the
economy as well as people’s expectations and emotions (particularly fear
and greed), I don’t believe that you should try to time the markets. Knowing
when to buy and sell is much harder than you think.
Be careful that you don’t get sucked into investing lots of your money in
aggressive investments that seem to be in a hyped state. Many people go
wrong when they begin to do this. In fact, many people don’t become aware
of an investment until it receives lots of attention. By the time everyone else
100
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

talks about an investment, it’s often nearing or at its peak. In the sections that
follow, I walk you through some of the biggest speculative bubbles. Although
some of these examples are from prior decades and even centuries, I chose
these examples because I find that they best teach the warning signs and
dangers of speculative fever times.
The Internet and technology bubble
Note: This first section is reproduced here verbatim as it appeared in the second
edition of this book, published in 1999, which turned out to be just one year
before the bubble actually burst.
Unless you isolate yourself from what we call civilization, you’ve surely heard
about the explosive growth in the Internet. In the mid-1990s, a number of
Internet-based companies launched initial public offerings of stock. (I discuss
IPOs in Chapter 4.) Most of the early Internet company stock offerings failed
to really catch fire. By the late 1990s, however, some of these stocks began
meteoric rises.
The bigger-name Internet stocks included companies such as Internet service
provider America Online, bookseller and online retailer Amazon.com, Internet
auctioneer eBay, and Internet portal Yahoo!. As with the leading new consumer
product manufacturers of the 1920s that I discuss in the section “The 1920s
consumer spending binge,” later in this chapter, many of the leading Internet
company stocks zoomed to the moon. Please note that the absolute stock price
per share of the leading Internet companies in the late 1990s was meaningless.
The P/E ratio is what mattered. Valuing the Internet stocks based upon earn-
ings posed a challenge because many of these Internet companies were losing
money or just beginning to make money. Some Wall Street analysts, therefore,
valued Internet stocks based upon revenue and not profits.
Valuing a stock based upon revenue and not profits can be highly dangerous.
Revenues don’t necessarily translate into high profits or any profits at all.
In the case of Amazon.com, its stock price soared in early 1999 to $221 per
share, which gave the company’s stock a total market valuation in excess of
$35 billion, or more than 12 times that of competing bookseller Barnes & Noble.
B&N had prior year sales of nearly $3 billion compared with Amazon.com’s
approximate $400 million sales as it was losing money! At its low in 2001,
Amazon’s market value had fallen nearly 95 percent to less than $2 billion, very
nearly the same valuation that Barnes & Noble had at that time. (Since it’s low
in 2001, Amazon’s stock value has bounced back somewhat but it was recently
valued at $15 billion, which still represents more than a 50 percent decline
since it’s 1999 peak.)
Now, Amazon.com, America Online, and other current leading Internet compa-
nies may go on to become some of the great companies and stocks of future
decades. However, consider this perspective from veteran money manager
David Dreman. “The Internet stocks are getting hundredfold more attention
101
Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks

from investors than, say, a Ford Motor in chat rooms online and elsewhere.
People are fascinated with the Internet — many individual investors have
accounts on margin. Back in the early 1900s, there were hundreds of auto
manufacturers, and it was hard to know who the long-term survivors would
be. The current leaders won’t probably be long-term winners.”
Internet stocks aren’t the only stocks being swept to excessive prices relative
to their earnings at the dawn of the new millennium. Various traditional retail-
ers announced the opening of Internet sites to sell their goods, and within
days, their stock prices doubled or tripled. Also, leading name-brand technol-
ogy companies, such as Dell Computer, Cisco Systems, Lucent, and
PeopleSoft, traded at P/E ratios in excess of 100. Investment brokerage firm
Charles Schwab, which expanded to offer Internet services, saw its stock
price balloon to push its P/E ratio over 100. As during the 1960s and 1920s,
name-brand growth companies soared to high P/E valuations. For example,
coffee purveyor Starbucks at times had a P/E near 100.
What I find troubling about investors piling into the leading, name-brand
stocks, especially in Internet and technology-related fields, is that many of
these investors don’t even know what a price/earnings ratio is and why it’s
important. Before you invest in any individual stock, no matter how great a
company you think it is, you need to understand the company’s line of busi-
ness, strategies, competitors, financial statements, and price/earnings ratio
versus the competition, among many other issues. Selecting and monitoring
good companies take lots of research, time, and discipline.
Also, remember that if a company taps into a product line or way of doing
business that proves highly successful, that company’s success invites lots
of competition. So you need to understand the barriers to entry that a lead-
ing company has erected and how difficult or easy it is for competitors to join
the fray. Also, be wary of analysts’ predictions about earnings and stock
prices. As more and more investment banking analysts initiated coverage of
Internet companies and issued buy ratings on said stocks, investors bought
more shares. Analysts, who are too optimistic (as shown in numerous inde-
pendent studies), have a conflict of interest because the investment banks
that they work for seek to cultivate the business (new stock and bond issues)
of the companies that they purport to rate and analyze. The analysts who
say, “buy, buy, buy all the current market leaders” are the same analysts who
generate much new business for their investment banks and get the lucrative
job offers and multimillion-dollar annual salaries.
Simply buying today’s rising and analyst-recommended stocks often leads to
future investor disappointment. If the company’s growth slows or the profits
don’t materialize as expected, the underlying stock price can nose dive. This
happened to investors who piled into the stock of computer disk drive maker
Iomega back in early 1996. After a spectacular rise to about $271⁄2 per share,
the company fell on tough times. Iomega stock subsequently plunged to less
than $3 per share. This stock probably won’t recover to its early 1996 price
levels for many more years.
102
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

Presstek, a company that uses computer technology for so-called direct imag-
ing systems, rose from less than $10 per share in mid-1994 to nearly $100 per
share just two years later — another example of supposed can’t-lose technol-
ogy that crashed and burned. As was the case with Iomega, herds of novice
investors jumped on the Presstek bandwagon simply because they believed
that the stock price would keep rising. By 1999, less than three years after 
hitting nearly $100 per share, it plunged more than 90 percent to about $5 per
share. It’s been recently trading around just $12 per share.
ATC Communications, which was similar to Iomega and glowingly recom-
mended by the Motley Fool Web site (see Chapter 19), plunged by more than
80 percent in a matter of months before the Fools recommended selling.
The Japanese stock market juggernaut
Lest you think that the United States cornered the market on manias, overseas
examples abound. A rather extraordinary mania happened not so long ago in
the Japanese stock market.
After Japan’s crushing defeat in World War II, its economy was in shambles.
Two major cities — Hiroshima and Nagasaki — were destroyed, and more
than 200,000 died when the United States dropped atomic bombs.
Out of the rubble, Japan emerged a strengthened nation that became an eco-
nomic powerhouse. Over the course of 22 years, from 1967 to 1989, Japanese
stock prices rose an amazing 30-fold (3,000 percent) as the economy boomed.
From 1983 to 1989 alone, Japanese stocks soared more than 500 percent.
In terms of the U.S. dollar, the Japanese stock market rise was all the more
stunning, as the dollar lost value versus Japan’s currency, the yen. The dollar
lost about 65 percent of its value during the big run-up in Japanese stocks. In
dollar terms, the Japanese stock market rose an astonishing 8,300 percent
from 1967 to 1989.
Many considered investing in Japanese stocks close to a sure thing. Increasing
numbers of people became full-time stock market investors in Japan. Many
of these folks were actually speculators because borrowed funds were used
heavily. As the Japanese real estate market boomed in tandem with the stock
market, real estate investors borrowed from their winnings to invest in
stocks and vice versa.
Borrowing heavily was easy to do; Japan’s banks were awash in cash, and it
was cheap, cheap, cheap to borrow. Investors could borrow money for an
interest rate of a mere few percent. “Established investors” could make prop-
erty purchases with no money down. Cash abounded from real estate as the
price of land in Tokyo, for example, soared 500 percent from 1985 to 1990.
Despite the fact that Japan has only 1⁄25 as much land as the United States,
Japan’s total land values at the close of the 1980s were four times that of all
the land in the United States.
103
Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks

Speculators also used futures and options (discussed in Chapter 1) to gamble
on higher short-term Japanese stock market prices. Interestingly, Japan doesn’t
allow selling short. Likewise, given the strong Japanese currency, investors
kept their money on their home turf, so they didn’t lose out from devaluation
of foreign currencies. Investing at home is one reason many Japanese investors
had little sense (from other nation’s stock markets) about what their invest-
ments were intrinsically worth.
Price/earnings ratios? Forget about it. To justify the high prices that they paid
for stocks, Japanese market speculators pointed out that the real estate that
many companies owned was soaring to the moon and making companies
more valuable.
Price/earnings ratios on the Japanese market soared during the early 1980s
and ballooned to more than 60 times earnings by 1987. As I point out elsewhere
in this chapter, such lofty P/E ratios were sometimes awarded beloved stocks
in the United States. But the entire Japanese stock market, which included
many mediocre and not-so-hot companies, possessed P/E ratios of 60-plus!
When Japan’s Nippon Telegraph and Telephone went public in February 1987,
it met such frenzied enthusiasm that its stock price was soon bid up to a
stratospheric 300-plus price/earnings ratio. At the close of 1989, Japan’s stock
market, for the first time in history, unseated the U.S. stock market in total
market value of all stocks. And this feat happened despite the fact that the total
output of the Japanese economy was less than half that of the U.S. economy.
Even some U.S. observers began to lose sight of the big picture and added to
the rationalizations for why the high levels of Japanese stocks were justified.
After all, it was reasoned, Japanese companies and executives were a tightly
knit and closed circle, investing heavily in the stocks of other companies that
they did business with. The supply of stock for outside buyers was thus lim-
ited as companies sat on their shares.
Corporate stock ownership went further, though, as stock prices were some-
times manipulated. Speculators gobbled up the bulk of outstanding shares of
small companies and traded shares back and forth with others whom they
partnered with to drive up prices. Company pension plans began to place all
(as in 100 percent) of their employees’ retirement money in stocks with the
expectation that stock prices would always keep going up.
The collapse of the Japanese stock market was swift. After peaking at the end
of 1989, the Tokyo market plunged nearly 50 percent in the first nine months
of 1990 alone. By the middle of 1992, the worst of the damage was over, with
Japanese stocks down nearly 65 percent — a plunge that the U.S. market
hasn’t experienced since the Great Depression. However, prices stagnated
during the rest of the 1990s and then plunged again in the early 2000s, finally
reaching a bottom in 2003 that was more than 80 percent lower than the peak
104
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

reached nearly 15 years prior. Japanese investors who borrowed lost every-
thing and sometimes more. The total loss in stock market value was about $3
trillion, about the size of the entire Japanese annual output.
Several factors finally led to the pricking of the Japanese stock market bubble.
Japanese monetary authorities tightened credit as inflation started to creep
upward and concern increased over real estate market speculation. As inter-
est rates began to rise, investors soon realized that they could earn 15 times
more interest from a safe bond versus the paltry yield on stocks.
As interest rates rose and credit tightened, speculators were squeezed first.
Real estate and stock market speculators began to sell their investments to
pay off mounting debts. Higher interest rates, less-available credit, and the
already grossly inflated prices greatly limited the pool of potential stock
buyers. The plunging stock and real estate markets fed off each other.
Investor losses in one market triggered more selling and price drops in the
other. The real estate price drop was equally severe — registering 50 to 60
percent or more in most parts of Japan after the late 1980s.
The 1960s weren’t just about sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll
The U.S. stock market mirrored the climate of our country during this decade
of change and upheaval. There were good years and bad years, but overall,
the stock market gained. Unfortunately, most investors who were old enough
to remember what happened to the stock market during the Great
Depression were retired or had passed away. The new investors and the
majority of the investors during the 1960s were born after the go-go years of
the 1920s or were still sucking on a pacifier.
During the 1960s, consumer product companies’ stocks were quite popular and
were bid up to stratospheric valuations. When I say “stratospheric valuations,”
I mean that some stock prices were high relative to the company’s earnings —
our old friend, the price/earnings (P/E) ratio. Investors had seen such stock
prices rise for many years and thought that the good times would never end.
Take the case of Avon Products, which sells cosmetics door-to-door, primarily
with an army of women. During the late 1960s, Avon’s stock regularly sold at a
P/E of 50 to 70 times earnings. (Remember, the market average is about 14.)
After trading as high as $140 per share in the early 1970s, Avon’s stock took
more than two decades to return to that price level. Remember that during
this time period the overall U.S. stock market rose more than tenfold!
When a stock such as Avon’s sells at such a high multiple of earnings, two
factors can lead to a bloodletting. First, the company’s profits may continue
to grow, but investors may decide that the stock isn’t such a great long-term
investment after all and not worth, say, a P/E of 60. Consider that if investors
decide it’s worth only a P/E of 30 (still a hefty P/E), the stock price would
drop 50 percent to cut the P/E in half.
105
Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks

The second shoe that can drop is the company’s profits or earnings. If profits
fall, say, 20 percent, as Avon’s did during the 1974 to 75 recession, the stock
price will fall 20 percent, even if it continued to sell for 60 times its earnings.
But when earnings drop, investors’ willingness to pay an inflated P/E plummets
along with the earnings. So when Avon’s profits finally did drop, the P/E that
investors were willing to pay plunged to 9 — in less than two years, Avon’s
stock price thus dropped nearly 87 percent!
Avon was not alone in its stock price soaring to a rather high multiple of its
earnings in the 1960s and early 1970s. Well-known companies such as Black &
Decker, Eastman Kodak, Kmart (used to be called S.S. Kresge in those days),
and Polaroid sold for 60 to as much as 100 times earnings. All these compa-
nies, like Avon, sell today at about the same or at a lower price than they
achieved decades ago. Many other well-known and smaller companies sold
at similar and even more outrageous premiums to earnings.
The 1920s consumer spending binge
The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared nearly 500 percent in a mere eight
years, from 1921 to 1929, one of the best bull market runs for the U.S. stock
market. The country and investors had good reason for economic optimism.
The “new” devices — telephones, cars, radios, and all sorts of electric appli-
ances — were making their way into the mass market. The stock price of
RCA, the radio manufacturer, for example, ballooned 5,700 percent during
this eight-year stretch.
Speculation in the stock market moved from Wall Street to Main Street.
Investors during the 1920s were able to borrow lots of money to buy stock
through margin borrowing. You can still margin borrow today — for every
dollar that you put up, you may borrow an additional dollar to buy stock. At
times during the 1920s, investors were able to borrow up to nine dollars for
every dollar that they had in hand. The amount of margin loans outstanding
swelled from $1 billion in the early 1920s to more than $8 billion in 1929.
When the market plunged, margin calls forced margin borrowers to sell their
stock, thus exacerbating the decline.
The steep run-up in stock prices was also due in part to market manipulation.
Investment pools used to buy and sell stock among one another, thus generat-
ing high trading volume in a stock, which made it appear that interest in the
stock was great. Also in cahoots with pool operators were writers who dis-
pensed enthusiastic prognostications about said stock. (Reforms later passed
by the Securities and Exchange Commission addressed these problems.)
Not only were members of the public largely enthusiastic, so too were the
supposed experts. After a small decline in September 1929, economist Irving
Fisher said in mid-October, “Stock prices have reached what looks like a per-
manently high plateau.” High? Yes! Permanent plateau? Investors wish!
106
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

On October 25, 1929, just days before all heck began breaking loose,
President Herbert Hoover said, “The fundamental business of the country . . .
is on a sound and prosperous basis.” Days later, multimillionaire oil tycoon
John D. Rockefeller said, “Believing that fundamental conditions of the coun-
try are sound . . . my son and I have for some days been purchasing sound
common stocks.”
By December of that same year, the stock market had dropped by more than
35 percent. General Electric President Owen D. Young said at that time,
“Those who voluntarily sell stocks at current prices are extremely foolish.”
Well, actually not. By the time the crash had run its course, the market had
plunged 89 percent in value in less than three years.
107
Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks
Maniacal manias in prior centuries
I could fill an entire book with modern-day stock
market manias. But bear with me as I roll back
the clocks a couple of centuries to observe other
market manias, the first being England’s so-
called South Seas bubble of 1719. South Seas
wasn’t the kind of company that would’ve met
today’s socially responsible investor’s needs.
Initially, the South Seas Company focused on the
African slave trade, but too many slaves died in
transit, so it wasn’t a lucrative business.
If you think government corruption is a problem
today, consider what politicians of those days did
without the scrutiny of a widely read press. King
George backed the South Seas Company and
acted as its governor. Politicos in Parliament
bought tons of stock in the South Seas Company
and even rammed through Parliament a provi-
sion that allowed investors to buy stock on bor-
rowed money. The stock of the South Seas
Company soared from about £120 to more than
£1000 in just the first six months of 1720.
After such an enormous run-up, insiders real-
ized that the stock price was greatly inflated
and quietly bailed. Citizens fell all over them-
selves to get into this surefire moneymaker.
Other seafaring companies pursued the South
Seas trade business, so the greedy politicians
passed a law that stated that only government-
approved companies could pursue trade. The
stocks of these other companies tumbled, and
investor losses led to a chain reaction that
prompted selling of the South Seas Company
stock, which plunged more than 80 percent by
the fall of that same year.
Unfortunately, England wasn’t the only Euro-
pean country that was swept up in an invest-
ment mania. Probably the most famous mania of
them all was the tulip bulb (yes, those flowers
that you can plant in your own home garden). A
botany professor introduced tulips into Holland
from Turkey in the late 1500s. Residents allowed
a fascination with these bulbs turn into an
investment feeding frenzy.
At their speculative peak, the price of a single
tulip bulb was the equivalent of more than
$10,000 in today’s dollars. Many people sold
their land holdings to buy more. Documented
cases show that people traded a bulb for a
dozen acres of land! Laborers cut back on their
work to invest. Eventually, tulip bulb prices
came crashing back to earth. A trip to your local
nursery shows you what a bulb sells for today.

The magnitude of this steep decline in stock prices couldn’t have been 
predicted or expected in the late 1920s. The economy went into a tailspin.
Unemployment soared to more than 25 percent of the labor force. Companies
entered this period with excess inventories, which mushroomed further
when people slashed their spending. High overseas tariffs stifled American
exports. Thousands of banks failed, as early bank failures triggered “runs”
on other banks. (No FDIC insurance existed in those days.)
Psychologically, it’s easier for many people to buy stocks after they’ve had a
huge increase in price. Just as you shouldn’t attempt to drive your car look-
ing solely through your rearview mirror, basing investments solely on past
performance usually leads novice investors into overpriced investments. If
many people talk about the stunning rise in the market and new investors
pile in based on the expectation of hefty profits, tread carefully.
I’m not saying that you need to sell your current stock holdings if you see an
investment market getting frothy and speculative. As long as you diversify
your stocks worldwide and hold other investments, such as real estate and
bonds, the stocks that you hold in one market need to be only a fraction of
your total holdings. Timing the markets is difficult: You can never know how
high is high and when it’s time to sell, and then how low is low and when it’s
time to buy. And if you sell non-retirement account investments at a profit,
you end up sacrificing a lot of the profit to federal and state taxes.
Buy more when stocks are “on sale”
Along with speculative buying frenzies come valleys of pessimism when stock
prices are falling sharply. Having the courage to buy when stock prices are
“on sale” can pay big returns.
In the early 1970s, interest rates and inflation escalated. Oil prices shot up as
the oil embargo choked off supplies, and Americans had to wait in long lines
for gas. Gold prices soared, and the U.S. dollar plunged in value on foreign
currency markets.
If the economic problems weren’t enough to make most everyone gloomy, the
U.S. political system hit an all-time low during this period as well. Vice
President Spiro Agnew resigned in disgrace under a cloud of tax-evasion
charges; then Watergate led to President Richard Nixon’s August 1974 resig-
nation, the first presidential resignation in our history.
When all was sold and done, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted
more than 45 percent from early 1973 until late 1974. Among the stocks that
fell the hardest and farthest included those that were most popular and sell-
ing at extreme multiples of earnings in the late 1960s and early 1970s. (See
the section “The 1960s weren’t just about sex, drugs, and rock ’n’ roll,” earlier
in this chapter.)

Those who were too terrified to buy stocks in the mid-1970s actually had
plenty of time to get on board and take advantage of the buying opportuni-
ties. The stock market did have a powerful rally and, from its 1974 low, rose
nearly 80 percent over the next two years. But over the next half-dozen years,
the market backpedaled, losing much of its gains.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, inflation continued to escalate well into
double digits. Corporate profits declined further, and unemployment rose
higher than in the 1974 recession. Although some stocks dropped, others
simply treaded water and went sideways for years after major declines in the
mid-1970s. As some companies’ profits increased, P/E bargains abounded (as
shown in Table 5-3).

When bad news and pessimism abound and the stock market has dropped,
it’s actually a much safer and better time to buy stocks. You may even con-
sider shifting some of your money out of your safer investments, such as
bonds, and invest more aggressively in stocks. Investors feel during these
times that prices can drop farther, but if you buy and wait, you’ll be amply
rewarded. Most of the stocks listed in the last several pages have appreciated
500 to 2,000-plus percent in the past couple of decades.
Avoiding Problematic Stock
Buying Practices
You may be curious about other ways to buy individual stocks, but if I list
those methods in this section, it’s because I don’t recommend using them.
You can greatly increase your chances of success and earn higher returns
if you avoid the commonly made stock investing mistakes that I present in
this section.
111
Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks

Don’t buy through commission-based 
brokers
Many investors make the mistake of investing in individual stocks through a
broker who earns a living from commissions. The standard pitch of these firms
and their brokers is that they maintain research departments that monitor and
report on stocks. Their brokers, using this research, tell you when to buy, sell,
or hold. Sounds good in theory, but this system has significant problems.
Many brokerage firms happen to be in another business that creates enor-
mous conflicts of interest in producing objective company reviews. You see,
these investment firms also solicit companies to help them sell new stock
and bond issues. To gain this business, the brokerage firms need to demon-
strate enthusiasm and optimism for the company’s future prospects.
Brokerage analysts who, with the best of intentions, write negative reports
about a company find their careers hindered in a variety of ways. Some firms
fire such analysts. Companies that the analysts criticize exclude the analysts
from analyst meetings about the company. Analysts who know what’s good
for their careers and their brokerage firms don’t write disapproving reports.
Although investment insiders know that analysts are overly optimistic, little
documented proof about this fact exists, and few people are willing to talk on
the record about it. One firm got caught encouraging its analysts via a memo
not to say negative things about companies. As uncovered by Wall Street
Journal reporter Michael Siconolfi, Morgan Stanley’s head of new stock issues
stated in a memo that the firm’s policy needed to include “no negative com-
ments about our clients.” The memo also stated that any analyst’s changes in
a stock’s rating or investment opinion, “which might be viewed negatively”
by the firm’s clients, had to be cleared through the company’s corporate
finance department head!
Various studies of the brokerage firm’s stock ratings have conclusively
demonstrated that from a predictive perspective, most of its research is
barely worth the cost of the paper that it’s printed on. In Chapter 6, I recom-
mend independent research reports that beat the brokerage industry track
record hands down. In Chapter 9, I cover the important issues that you need
to consider when you select a good broker.
Pass on initial public offerings
As I explain in Chapter 4, an initial public offering (IPO) occurs when a com-
pany offers new stock to the investing public. If you bought Microsoft’s IPO
back in the spring of 1986 and held on to it until today, you’d be a mighty
happy camper, having made more than a 300-times return on your money. If
you had invested $10,000 in Microsoft stock back then, it would have grown
112
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

to in excess of $3 million! Similar tales abound for investors who scooped up
shares of McDonald’s and other companies that have grown into behemoth,
multibillion-dollar, worldwide enterprises.
So you’d like to buy shares of the next Microsoft and McDonald’s? Who
wouldn’t? Investors and brokers who tell you that they bought IPOs that
became big successes have a lot in common with some people who go fishing
and tell you about the days that the fish were really biting and they landed
some big catches. But you hear nothing at all about the hours and days
during which they caught nothing or only small fry.
Even factoring in the Microsofts and the McDonald’s restaurants of the world,
IPOs as a group are poor investments. You read that right! Two university
professors, Jay Ritter and Timothy Loughran, went to the trouble of docu-
menting the performance of the thousands of IPOs that have happened since
1970. Here’s what they found:
Average annual return on the IPO stocks
5 percent per year
Average annual return on comparable stocks
12 percent per year
Don’t invest in IPOs. Instead of IPO standing for “initial public offering,” it’s
more apt to mean “it’s probably overpriced.” It’s easy to see a decade later
which companies dominate their industries and whose stock prices rocket
skyward. However, picking these companies in advance is a difficult task.
Investing in IPOs has proved to be a losing stock market investment strategy.
Not surprisingly, most IPOs come to market when the market is high (such as
during the late 1990s) so that companies can maximize their take. Don’t buy
IPOs, and run from them as fast as you can in an overheated market. If you
can get in on the ground floor of an IPO (buy at the offering price), that’s a
sign that the stock is a turkey or a small, risky offering.
Don’t day trade or short-term trade
Unfortunately (for themselves), some investors track their stock investments
closely and believe that they need to sell after short holding periods —
months, weeks, or even days. With the growth of Internet and computerized
trading, such shortsightedness has taken a turn for the worse as more
investors now engage in a foolish process known as day trading, where you
buy and sell a stock within the same day!
If you hold a stock only for a few hours or a few months, you’re not investing;
you’re gambling. Specifically, the numerous drawbacks that I see to short-
term trading include the following:
 Higher trading costs: Although the commission that you pay to trade
stocks has declined greatly in recent years, especially through online
trading (which I discuss in Chapter 9), the more you trade, the more of
113
Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks

your investment dollars go into a broker’s wallet. Commissions are like
taxes — once collected, your dollars are forever gone, and your return
is reduced. Similarly, the spread between what you pay to purchase a
stock and the price you would receive to sell the same stock (known as
the bid-ask spread) can be a significant drag on your investment return.
 More taxes (and tax headaches): When you invest outside of tax-
sheltered retirement accounts, you must report every time that you
buy and then sell a stock on your annual income tax return. After
you make a profit, you must part with a good portion of it through
the federal and state capital gains tax that you owe from the sale of
your stock. If you sell a stock within one year of buying it, the IRS and
most state tax authorities consider your profit short-term, and you
owe a much higher rate of tax than if you hold your stock for more
than a year. Holding your stock for more than a year qualifies you for
the favorable long-term capital gains tax rate (a topic that I discuss in
Chapter 21). The return that you keep (after taxes) is more important
than the return that you make (before taxes).
 Lower returns: If stocks increase in value over time, long-term buy-and-
hold investors will enjoy the fruits of the stock’s appreciation. However,
when you jump in and then out of stocks, your money spends a good
deal of time not invested in stocks. The overall level of stock prices in
general and individual stocks in particular sometimes rises sharply
during short periods of time. Thus, day traders and other short-term
traders inevitably miss stock run-ups. The best professional investors
whom I know don’t engage in short-term trading for this reason (as well
as because of the increased transaction costs and taxes that such trad-
ing inevitably generates).
 Lost opportunities: Most of the short-term traders that I’ve met over the
years spend inordinate amounts of time researching and monitoring
their investments. During the late 1990s, I began to hear of more and
more people who quit their jobs so they could manage their investment
portfolio full time! Some of the firms that sell day trading seminars tell
you that you can make a living trading stocks. Your time is clearly worth
something. Put your valuable time into working a little more on building
your own business instead of wasting all those extra hours each day and
week watching your investments like a hawk, which hampers rather
than enhances your returns.
 Poorer relationships: Time is our most precious commodity. In addition
to the financial opportunities that you lose when you indulge in unpro-
ductive trading, you need to consider the personal consequences. Like
drinking, smoking, and gambling, short-term trading is an addictive
behavior. Spouses of day traders and other short-term traders report
unhappiness over how much more time and attention their mates spend
on their investments than their families. And what about the lack of
114
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

attention that day traders and short-term traders give friends and other
relatives? (See the sidebar “Recognizing an investment gambling prob-
lem in yourself or someone you love” in this chapter to help determine
whether you or a loved one has a gambling addiction.)
How a given stock performs in the next few hours, days, weeks, or even
months may have little to do with the underlying financial health and vitality
of the company’s business. In addition to short-term swings in investor emo-
tions, unpredictable events (the emergence of a new technology or competi-
tor, analyst predictions, changes in government regulation, and so on) push
stocks one way or another for short periods of time.
As I say throughout this part of the book, stocks are intended to be long-term
holdings. You shouldn’t buy stocks if you don’t plan on holding them for at
least five years or more — and preferably seven to ten. When stocks suffer a
setback, it may take months or even years for them to come back.
Don’t buy penny stocks
Even worse than buying stocks through a broker whose compensation
depends on what you buy and how often you trade is purchasing penny stocks
through brokers that specialize in such stocks. As I explain in Chapter 4, tens of
thousands of smaller-company stocks trade on the over-the-counter market.
Some of these companies are quite small and sport low prices per share that
range from pennies to several dollars, hence the name penny stocks.
Here’s how penny-stock brokers typically work. Many of these firms purchase
prospect lists of people who have demonstrated a propensity for buying
other lousy investments by phone. Brokers are taught to first introduce them-
selves by phone and then call back shortly thereafter with a tremendous
sense of urgency about a great opportunity to get in on the “ground floor” of
a small but soon-to-be stellar company. Not all these companies and stocks
have terrible prospects, but many do.
The biggest problem with buying penny stocks through such brokers is that
they’re grossly overpriced. Just as you don’t make good investment returns
by purchasing jewelry that’s marked up 100 percent, you don’t have a fight-
ing chance to make decent money on penny stocks that the broker may flog
with similar markups. The individual broker who cons you into “investing” in
such cheap stocks gains a big commission, which is why he continues to call
you with “opportunities” until you send him a check. Many brokers in this
business who possess records of securities violations also possess an ability
to sell, so they have no problem gaining employment with other penny-stock
peddlers.

Recognizing an investment gambling problem
in yourself or someone you love
Some gamblers spend their time at the racetrack,
and you can find others in casinos. Increasingly,
though, you can find gamblers at their personal
computers, tracking and trading stocks.
More investors than ever are myopically focused
on stocks’ short-term price movements. Several
factors contribute to this troubling activity: the
strong stock market performance in the late
1990s, increased media coverage (including
cable stock market channels), the slide in stock
prices that began in 2000, and the ensuing
market volatility. Also, companies touting them-
selves as educational institutions suck legions of
novice investors into dangerous practices.
Masquerading under such pompous names as
institutes or academies, these firms purport to
teach you how to get rich day trading stocks.
Perhaps you’ve heard their ads on the radio or
seen them on stock market cable television
channels or on the Internet for “seminars” or
other “training” methods. All you have to do is
part with several thousand dollars for the train-
ing, but the only people getting rich are the
owners of such seminar companies.
The nonprofit organization Gamblers Anonymous
developed the following 20 questions to help you
figure out whether you or someone you know is
a compulsive gambler who needs help:
1. Did you ever lose time from work or school
due to gambling?
2. Has gambling ever made your home life
unhappy?
3. Did gambling affect your reputation?
4. Have you ever felt remorse after gambling?
5. Did you ever gamble to get money with
which to pay debts or otherwise solve
financial difficulties?
6. Did gambling cause a decrease in your
ambition or efficiency?
7. After losing, did you feel you must return as
soon as possible and win back your losses?
8. After a win, did you have a strong urge to
return and win more?
9. Did you often gamble until your last dollar
was gone?
10. Did you ever borrow money to finance your
gambling?
11. Have you ever sold anything to finance
gambling?
12. Were you reluctant to use “gambling
money” for normal expenditures?
13. Did gambling make you careless of the wel-
fare of your family?
14. Did you ever gamble longer than you had
planned?
15. Have you ever gambled to escape worry or
trouble?
16. Have you ever committed, or consider-
ed committing, an illegal act to finance 
gambling?
17. Did gambling cause you to have difficulty in
sleeping?
18. Do arguments, disappointments, or frustra-
tions create within you an urge to gamble?
19. Did you ever have an urge to celebrate any
good fortune by a few hours of gambling?
20. Have you ever considered self-destruction
as a result of your gambling?
According to Gamblers Anonymous, compulsive
gamblers typically answer yes to seven or more
of these questions.

A number of penny-stock brokerage firms are known for engaging in manipu-
lation of stock prices, driving up prices of selected shares to suck in gullible
investors and then leaving the public holding the bag. These firms may also
encourage companies to issue new overpriced stock that their brokers can
then flog to people like you.
If you remember a fellow by the name of Robert Brennan, you know that he is
the granddaddy of this reptilian business. I won’t bore you with all the details
except to say that after more than a decade of financial shenanigans, Brennan
was ordered by a judge to pay investors more than $70 million for all the bad
stuff that he did. Pending suits may lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in
additional judgments against Brennan’s companies.
I remember when Brennan ran his infamous “Come Grow with Us” television
ads, in which he hopped out of a helicopter. Brennan was always nicely
dressed and maintained a polished image. In addition to being in the penny
stock trade, it’s interesting to note that Brennan owned a horse racetrack
and wanted to get into the casino business. All Brennan’s businesses
share the same characteristics — they don’t involve investments, and
they stack the deck against the gullible members of the public whom they
hoodwink.
Don’t buy broker-sold limited partnerships
At their peak, brokers and brokers who masquerade as financial planners
sold more than $10 billion per year of limited partnerships (LP). Prudential
Securities sold more of these terrible investments than any other organiza-
tion and has suffered the most pain as a result, having to cough up hundreds
of millions of dollars as a result of lawsuits. I explain in Chapter 3 the funda-
mental problems (mainly outrageous commissions and fees) that drain your
LP investment returns.
The Keys to Stock Market Success
Anybody, no matter what their educational background, IQ, occupation,
income, or assets, can make good money through stock investments. Over
long periods of time, you can expect to earn an average of 9 to 10 percent
per year total return by investing in stocks.
117
Chapter 5: Building Wealth with Stocks

To maximize your chances of stock market investment success, do the 
following:
 Don’t try to time the markets. Anticipating where the stock market and
specific stocks are heading is next to impossible, especially over the short
term. Economic factors, which are influenced by thousands of elements,
as well as human emotions, determine stock market prices. Be a regular
buyer of stocks with new savings. As I discuss earlier in this chapter, buy
more stocks when they’re on sale and market pessimism is running high.
 Diversify. Invest in the stocks of different-size companies in varying
industries around the world. When you assess the performance of your
investments, look at your whole portfolio at least once a year, and calcu-
late your total return after expenses and trading fees.
 Keep trading costs, management fees, and commissions to a minimum.
These represent a big drain on your returns. If you invest through a
broker or “financial advisor” who earns a living on commissions, odds
are high that you’re paying far more than you need to be, and you’re
likely receiving biased advice.
 Pay attention to taxes. Like commissions and fees, federal and state taxes
are a major investment “expense” that you can minimize. Contribute most
of your money to your tax-advantaged retirement accounts. You can
invest your money outside of retirement accounts, but keep an eye on
taxes (see Chapter 3). Calculate your annual returns on an after-tax basis.
 Don’t overestimate your ability to pick the big winning stocks. One of
the best ways to invest in stocks is through mutual funds (see Chapter 8),
where you can hire an experienced, full-time money manager at a low cost
to perform all the investing grunt work for you. If you want to invest in
individual stocks, stay clear of initial public offerings, particularly trendy
popular ones and ones that are issued during times of an overheated
stock market.

his chapter provides a crash course in researching individual companies

approach before you head down the path of picking and choosing your own
stocks. If you haven’t already done so, please read Chapter 5 now to help you
better understand the process of purchasing stocks on your own.
If you decide to tackle the task of researching your own stocks, you don’t
need to worry about finding enough information: The problem to worry
about is information overload. You can literally spend hundreds of hours
researching and reading information on one company alone. Therefore,
unless you’re financially independent and want to spend nearly all your pro-
ductive time investing, you need to focus on where you can get the best bang
for your buck and time.
Leveraging from Others’ Research
If you were going to build a house, I bet that you wouldn’t actually try to do it
on your own. At the very least, you’d probably find some sort of kit or a set of
plans drawn up by others who have built many houses. You can do the same
when it comes to picking individual stocks. In this section, I highlight useful
resources that allow you to hit the ground running when trying to pick the
best stocks. In addition to the resources I cover here, please see Chapter 19
for a list and description of numerous other useful resources for researching
individual stocks.

Discovering the Value Line
Investment Survey
Value Line’s securities analysts have tracked and researched stocks since the
Great Depression. Their analysis and recommendation track record is quite
good, and their analysts are beholden to no one. Many professional money
managers use Value Line as a reference because of its comprehensiveness.
The beauty of Value Line’s service is that it condenses the key information
and statistics about a stock (and the company behind the stock) to a single
page. Suppose that you’re interested in investing in Starbucks, the retail cof-
feehouse operator. You’ve seen all its stores, and you figure that if you’re
going to shell out more than $3 for a cup of its flavored hot water, you may as
well participate in the profits and growth of the company. You look up the
current stock price (I explain how to do that later in this chapter if you don’t
know how) and are happy to see that it’s a mere $21 per share.
Let’s take a look at the important elements of a Value Line page for Starbucks,
shown in Figure 6-1.
The information in Value Line reports is in no way inside information. Look at
these reports the same way that you review a history book — they’re useful
background information that can keep you from repeating common mistakes.
1. Business
This section describes the business(es) that Starbucks participates in. You
can see that Starbucks is the largest retailer of specialty coffee in the world.
Although 84 percent of the company’s sales come from retail, note that 16
percent come from other avenues — such as mail order and supermarket
sales. You also find details about joint ventures, such as the partnership of
Starbucks and Pepsi to develop and sell a bottled coffee drink. In this section,
you also can see that the senior executives and directors of the company
own a decent share (4.9 percent) of the stock — it’s good to see these folks
have a financial stake in the success of the company and stock.
2. Analyst assessment
A securities analyst (in this case, Justin Hellman) follows each Value Line
stock. An analyst focuses on specific industries and follows a few dozen
stocks. This section provides the analyst’s summary and commentary of the
company’s current situation and future plans.
Adding it all up, Hellman notes the stock is attractive over the longer term
but that investors may wish to wait to buy the stock at lower prices (when he
prepared the report, the stock was trading at nearly $55 per share). He
neglects to mention a specific price that is attractive to buy into the stock.

Examining the stock price graph (4), you can see a line that represents a mul-
tiple of cash flow, which should be such a price. See the description in item
number 4, “Stock price performance,” later in this section, for an explanation
of the stock price graph and cash flow line.

3. Value Line’s rating
Value Line provides a numerical ranking for each stock’s timeliness (expected
performance) over the next year. One is highest, five is lowest, and only about
5 percent of all stocks receive these extreme ratings. A two rating is above
average and a four rating below average, and about one-sixth of the ranked
stocks receive each of these ratings. All remaining stocks, a little more than
half the total ranked, get the average three rating.
The safety rank works the same way as the timeliness rating, with one repre-
senting the best and least volatile stocks and the most financially stable com-
panies. Five is the worst safety ranking and is given to the most volatile stocks
and least financially stable companies.
I’ve never been a fan of predictions and short-term thinking. (One year is a
very short period of time for the stock market.) However, historically, Value
Line’s system holds one of the best overall track records according to the
Hulbert Financial Digest, which tracks the actual performance of investment
newsletter recommendations. However, you shouldn’t necessarily run out
and buy Starbucks because of its high ranking. Just keep in mind that higher-
ranked stocks within Value Line have historically outperformed those with-
out such ratings.
4. Stock price performance
This graph shows you the stock price’s performance over the past decade or
so. The highest and lowest points of the line on the graph indicate the high
and low stock price for each month. At the top of the graph you see the
year’s high and low prices. Starbucks stock has steadily risen since it first
issued stock in 1992. (The small box in the lower-right corner of the graph
shows you the total return that an investor in this stock earned over the pre-
vious 1, 3, and 5 years and how those returns compare with the average
stock. This graph shows you that Starbucks has risen sharply and has beaten
the average stock’s return in recent years.)
The graph also shows how the price of the stock moves with changes in the
company’s cash flow. Over time, just as stock prices tend to track corporate
profits, so too should they generally follow cash flow. Cash flow is an impor-
tant measure of a company’s financial success and health — it’s different
from net profits, which the company reports for tax purposes. For example,
the tax laws allow companies to take a tax deduction each year for the depre-
ciation (devaluation) of the company’s equipment and other assets. Although
depreciation is good because it helps lower a company’s tax bill, subtracting
it from the company’s revenue gives an untrue picture of the company’s cash
flow (money coming in minus money going out). Thus, in calculating a com-
pany’s cash flow, depreciation isn’t subtracted from revenue.

5. Historic financials
This section shows you up to 12 to 18 years of financial information on the
company (in the case of Starbucks, you get information going back to just
1992 because that’s when the company went public). The two most helpful
pieces of information in this section are
 Book value per share: This indicates the value of the company’s assets,
including equipment, manufacturing plants, and real estate, minus any
liabilities. Book value gives somewhat of a handle on the amount that
the company can sell for if it has a “going-out-of-business sale.” I say
somewhat because the value of some assets on a company’s books isn’t
correct. For example, some companies own real estate, bought long ago,
that is worth far more than the company’s current financial statements
indicate. Conversely, some manufacturers with equipment find that if
they have to dump some equipment in a hurry, they need to sell the
equipment at a discount to entice a buyer.
The book value of a bank, for example, can mislead you if the bank
makes loans that won’t be paid back, and the bank’s financial statements
don’t document this fact. All these complications with book value are
why full-time, professional money managers exist. (If you want to delve
more into a company’s book value, you need to look at other financial
statements, such as the company’s annual report, which I discuss in the
“Understanding Annual Reports” section, later in this chapter.)
 Market share: For some companies (not Starbucks), Value Line also pro-
vides another useful number in this section — the market share, which
indicates the portions of the industry that the company has captured in
a given year. A sustained slide in a company’s market share is a danger-
ous sign that may indicate its customers are leaving for other companies
that presumably offer better products at lower prices. But that doesn’t
mean that you should avoid investing in a company that possesses such
problems. You can produce big returns if you can identify companies
that reposition and strengthen their product offerings to reverse a
market share slide.
6. P/E ratio
This tells you that Starbucks sells at a P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) of 45
because of its recent stock price and earnings. This P/E is quite high relative
to the overall market. (You can see that Starbucks’ P/E is 2.46 times that of
the overall market.) To understand the importance of P/E in evaluating a
stock, please refer to Chapter 5.
7. Capital structure
This section summarizes the amount of outstanding stocks and bonds that the
company possesses. Remember that when a company issues these securities,
it receives capital (money). What is most useful to examine in this section is
123
Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks

the company’s debt. If a company accumulates a lot of debt (as many govern-
ments have), the burden of interest payments can create a real drag on profits.
If profits stay down for too long, debt can even push some companies into
bankruptcy.
Figure 6-1 shows you that Starbucks has outstanding debt of $4 million. This
section delineates between two types of debt:
 Short-term debt: Debt due within one year
 Long-term debt: Debt that has to be paid back in more than a year
So how do you know if this is a lot, a little, or just the right amount of debt?
You can calculate long-term interest earned, which compares a company’s
annual profits to the yearly interest payments on its long-term debt. For
example, if a company has long-term interest earned of 4.5x, that means that
the company’s most recent yearly profits can cover the interest payments on
its long-term debt for about 41⁄2 years. Starbucks has little debt — the com-
pany’s most recent annual profits of $392 million dwarf its long-term interest
payments of $0.1 million.

Getting your hands on Value Line reports
The least costly way to obtain Value Line pages
on stocks that interest you is to visit your local
library. Most libraries that have decent business
sections subscribe to it.
If you want your own copy of Value Line to read
in the comfort of your home, Value Line
(800-634-3583) offers a 13-week trial subscrip-
tion to its Value Line Investment Survey for $75.
An annual subscription costs $598. At the start
of your subscription, you receive a rather large
binder, divided into 13 sections, that includes
the most recent reports on the 1,700-plus large-
and medium-size-company stocks that this pub-
lication tracks. Every week, you receive a new
packet of reports that replaces one of the 13
sections. Thus, at the end of 13 weeks, you have
new reports on all the stocks.
The trial subscription is a great place to start
your research because you receive all the cur-
rent reports plus the next ten weeks’ worth of
updates for a reasonable fee. You can also see
how much use you get out of the reports. The
trial offer is available to each household only
once every three years.
Value Line also offers a Small and Mid-Cap
Edition that contains reports on about 1,800 addi-
tional smaller companies. Unlike traditional Value
Line pages, these pages include no analyst com-
mentary or projections. A one-year subscription
to this publication costs $249.

Possessing a larger cushion to cover debt is more important when the com-
pany’s business is volatile. Total interest coverage represents a similar compar-
ison of profits to interest owed for all the debt that a company owes, not just
long-term debt. This number tells you the number of years that the company’s
most recent annual profits can cover interest on all the company’s debt.
Warning signs for total interest coverage numbers include a steep decline in
this number over time and profits that cover less than one year’s worth of
interest.
8. Current position
This section provides a quick look at how the company’s current assets (cur-
rent meaning an asset that can be sold and converted into cash within a year
relatively easily) compared with its current liabilities (debts due within the
year). Trouble may be brewing if a company’s current liabilities exceed or are
approaching its current assets.
Some financial analysts calculate the quick ratio. The quick ratio ignores inven-
tory when comparing current assets to current liabilities. A company may have
to dump inventory at a relatively low price if it needs to raise cash quickly.
Thus, some analysts argue, you need to ignore inventory as a current asset.
9. Annual rates
This nifty section can save wear and tear on your calculator. The good folks
at Value Line calculate rates of growth (or shrinkage) on important financial
indicators, such as sales (revenues) and earnings (profits) over the past five
and ten years. Value Line also lists their projections for the next five years.
Projections can prove highly unreliable, even from a research firm as good as
Value Line. In most cases, the projections assume that the company will con-
tinue as it has in the most recent couple years.
10. Quarterly financials
For the most recent years, Value Line shows you an even more detailed quar-
terly breakout of sales and profits, which may disclose changes that annual
totals mask. You can also see the seasonality of some businesses. Starbucks,
for example, tends to have its slowest quarter in the winter (quarter ending
March 31). This makes sense if you figure that many of the customers who
frequent Starbucks’ coffee shops do so as they walk around town, which
people tend to do less of on a blustery winter day.

Examining successful money
managers’ stock picks
To make money in stocks, you certainly don’t need an original idea. In fact, it
makes sense to examine what the best money managers are buying for their
portfolios. Don’t worry; I’m not suggesting that you invade their privacy or
ask rude questions!
The best mutual fund managers, for example, are required to disclose at least
twice a year what stocks they hold in their portfolio. You can call the fund
companies and ask them to send their most recent semiannual reports that
detail their stock holdings; you can also view those reports on many fund
company’s Web sites. (See Chapter 8 for more information on the best stock
mutual funds.)
Through software and via its Web site, Morningstar (www.morningstar.com)
allows you to see which mutual funds hold large portions of a given stock
that you may be researching.
Finally, you can follow what investment legend Warren Buffett is buying
through his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway. Check out its corporate
filings on the Securities and Exchange Commission Web site at www.sec.gov.
Reviewing financial publications
Many publications cover the world of stocks. Be careful. Just because a
columnist or publication advocates particular stocks or investing strategies
doesn’t mean that you will achieve success by following her advice.
The following publications offer useful columns and commentary, sometimes
written by professional money managers, on individual stocks: Barron’s,
Business Week, Forbes, Kiplinger’s, and The Wall Street Journal.
Understanding Annual Reports
After you review the Value Line page on a company and want to dig further
into financial documents, the next step is to ask yourself why. Why do you
want to torture yourself so?
126
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

I successfully completed one of the supposedly better M.B.A. programs
(Stanford’s) and took more than my fair share of accounting and finance
courses. Over the years, I’ve gotten to know investment managers and finan-
cial analysts who research companies. Although some financial documents
aren’t that difficult to read (I show you how in this section), interpreting what
they mean in respect to a company’s future isn’t easy.
All publicly traded companies must annually file certain financial documents.
Consider reviewing these documents to enhance your understanding of a
company’s businesses and strategies rather than for the predictive value that
you may hope they provide.
The first of such useful documents that companies produce is the annual
report. This yearly report provides standardized financial statements as well
as management’s discussion about how the company has performed and how
it plans to improve its performance in the future. If you’re a bit of the skepti-
cal sort, like I am, you may think, “Aren’t the company’s officials going to
make everything sound rosy and wonderful?”
To a certain extent, yes, but not as badly as you may think, especially at com-
panies that adhere to sound accounting principles and good old-fashioned
ethics. First, a large portion of annual reports includes the company’s financial
statements, which an accounting firm must audit. However, audits don’t mean
that companies and their accounting firms can’t (often legally) structure the
company’s books to make them look rosier than they really are. And some
companies have pulled the wool over the eyes of their auditors, who then
became unwitting accomplices in producing false financial figures.
You’ve surely heard of the accounting scandals at companies such as Enron
and WorldCom. These companies manipulated their financial books, with the
blessing of supposedly blue-chip corporate auditors, to mislead investors into
believing that they were more profitable than they really were. (Identifying trou-
ble before other investors do is a skill that many professional investors haven’t
mastered — if you can identify trouble early, go manage other people’s money!)
Also keep in mind that more than a few companies have been sued for mislead-
ing shareholders with inflated forecasts or lack of disclosure of problems.
Responsible companies try to present a balanced and, of course, hopeful per-
spective in their annual reports. Most companies’ annual reports are written
by non-techno geeks, so you have a decent chance of understanding them.
Financial and business highlights
The first section of most annual reports presents a description of a com-
pany’s recent financial highlights and business strategies. You can use this
127
Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks

information to find out about the businesses that the company is in and
where the company is heading. For example, in Figure 6-1, Value Line men-
tioned that Starbucks is also in the specialty sales business. The annual
report can provide more detail about Starbucks’ specialty business.
Okay, enough about the coffee business — I want to expose you to another
industry. T. Rowe Price is a publicly traded investment company that offers
some decent mutual funds. In Figure 6-2, you can see that T. Rowe Price man-
ages money in a variety of investment funds that provide investment advisory
fees and other fees.

Balance sheet
You can find a company’s hard-core financials in the back portion of most
annual reports. You can find many of these same numbers in Value Line
reports, except you get more specific details in the company’s annual report.
All annual reports contain a balance sheet, which is a snapshot summary of
all the company’s assets and liabilities. The balance sheet covers the com-
pany’s assets and liabilities from the beginning of the year to the last day of
the company’s year-end, which is typically December 31. Some companies
use a fiscal year that ends at other times of the year.
A company’s balance sheet resembles a personal balance sheet. The entries,
of course, look a little different because you likely don’t own things like 
manufacturing equipment. And if you read my Personal Finance For Dummies
book, you know that I’m against listing personal property, such as furniture
and cars, as assets. (Do you plan to sell these things to raise money for 
retirement, home buying, and so on?) Figure 6-3 shows a typical corporate
balance sheet.

Assets
The assets section lists the following items that the company holds or owns
that are of significant value:
 Cash: I suspect that you know what cash is. Lest you think that stacks of
green bills sit around in corporate vaults, rest assured that companies
invest this money to earn interest. Many items are explained in more
detail in explanatory notes that follow these financial statements. Note 1
explains that T. Rowe Price eats its own cooking — the company keeps
its extra cash in its own money market funds.

Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks

 Accounts receivable: This is money that is owed to the company. Just
as your employer pays you at month’s end for your work during the
entire month, the company is paid for services previously provided. If
you’re paid $4,000 monthly at month’s end, and you prepare your own
personal balance midmonth, you can list a salary of $2,000 as an asset
because it’s money due you that you haven’t yet received.
As companies grow, their accounts receivable usually do, too. Watch out
for cases where the receivables grow faster than the sales (revenue).
This growth may indicate that the company is having problems with its
products’ quality or pricing. Unhappy customers pay more slowly or
demand bigger price discounts.
 Investments: In addition to cash, some companies may invest in other
securities, such as bonds and stocks. Just as with your own personal situ-
ation, companies usually invest money that they don’t expect to use in the
near future. (As with the company’s cash investments, the explanatory
note states that T. Rowe Price invests in its own bond and stock funds.)
 Property and equipment: All companies need equipment to run their
businesses. This equipment can include office furniture, computers, real
estate they own, and manufacturing machinery that the company uses
to make its products. Equipment becomes less valuable over time, so
the company considers this depreciation as a cost of doing business
each year. Therefore, if a company ceases buying new equipment, this
entry on the balance sheet gradually decreases because the deprecia-
tion is subtracted from the value of the equipment.
 Goodwill: One of the assets that doesn’t show up on most companies’
balance sheets is their goodwill. Companies work hard through advertis-
ing, product development, and service to attract and retain customers.
Name-brand recognition is a term that you sometimes hear thrown
around. Companies can’t put a value on the goodwill that they’ve gener-
ated, but when they purchase (acquire) another firm, some of the pur-
chase price is considered goodwill. Specifically, if a company is acquired
for $100 million but has a net worth (assets minus liabilities) of just $50
million, the extra $50 million goes to goodwill. The goodwill then
becomes an asset on the acquiring company’s balance sheet.
 Other assets: This is a catch-all category that may include some stuff
that can make your eyes glaze over. For example, companies keep a dif-
ferent (yes, this is legal) set of books for tax purposes. Not surprisingly,
companies do this because the IRS allows, in some cases, more deduc-
tions than what the company is required to show from an accounting
standpoint on their financial statements. (If you were a company, wouldn’t
you want your shareholders, but not the IRS, to see gobs of profits?)
Companies treat tax deferment as an asset until the IRS receives more of
its share down the road.
130
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

Manufacturing and retail companies also track and report inventory (the prod-
uct that hasn’t yet been sold) as an asset. Generally speaking, as a business
grows, so does its inventory. If inventory grows more quickly than revenue,
such growth may be a warning sign. This growth can indicate that customers
are scaling back purchases and that the company miscalculated and overpro-
duced. It can also be a leading indicator of an obsolete or inferior product
offering.
Liabilities
This section summarizes all the money that the company owes to others:
 Accounts payable: When companies make requests to purchase things
for their business, they sometimes have a lag between receiving a bill
and when they pay it; the money owed is called accounts payable. As
with inventory and accounts receivable, accounts payable generally
increases with a company’s increasing revenue.
If accounts payable increases faster than revenue, it can indicate a prob-
lem. On the other hand, that increase can also be a sign of good financial
management. The longer you take to pay your bills, the longer you have
the money in your pocket working for you.
 Accrued compensation: This line tallies money that the company must
someday pay its employees. For example, many larger firms maintain
pension plans. These plans promise workers who retire with at least five
years of service a monthly income check in retirement. Thus, the com-
pany must reserve this money that it owes and list it as a liability or
debt that it must someday pay.
 Income taxes payable: Companies are in business to make a profit, and
as they earn those profits, they need to reserve a portion to pay income
taxes. As I explain earlier, some of the taxes that the company owes can
be caused by accounting differences between the company’s financial
statements and those filed with the IRS.
 Dividends payable: Not all companies pay dividends (see Chapter 4) to
their shareholders. But those companies that do pay dividends typically
declare the dividend several weeks in advance of when they actually
owe the dividend. During this interim period, the company lists the not-
yet-paid dividends as a liability.
Stockholders’ equity
The difference between a company’s assets and liabilities is known as stock-
holders’ equity. Stockholders’ equity is what makes balance sheets always bal-
ance. When companies issue stock, for example, they receive cash, which
they then list as an asset.
131
Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks

Companies divide stock proceeds between par value and capital in excess of
par value. In the case of T. Rowe Price, the par value is $0.20 per share. Par
values are arcane — and largely meaningless.
Income statement
The other big financial statement in an annual report is the income statement
(see Figure 6-4).
Revenue
Revenue is simply the money that the company receives from its customers
as compensation for its products or services. Just as you can earn income
from your job(s) as well as investments and other sources, a company can
make money from a variety of sources. In the case of mutual fund provider T.
Rowe Price, the firm collects fees (investment advisory and administrative)
for the mutual fund investments that it manages on behalf of its customers as
well as privately managed money for wealthy individuals and institutions.
The company also receives income from its own money that it has invested.
Ideally, you want to see a steady or accelerating rate of growth in a com-
pany’s revenue. If a company’s revenue grows more slowly, you need to
inquire why. Is it because of poor service or product performance, better
competitor offerings, ineffective marketing, or all the above?
For companies with multiple divisions or product lines, the annual report
may detail the revenue of each product line in a later section. If it doesn’t,
check out some of the other financial statements that the next section,
“Exploring Other Useful Corporate Reports,” recommends. Examine what
spurs or holds back the company’s overall growth and what different busi-
nesses the company operates in. Look for businesses that were acquired but
don’t really fit with the company’s other business units as a red flag. Large
companies that have experienced stalled revenue growth sometimes try to
“enter” new businesses through acquisition but then don’t manage them well
because they don’t understand the keys to their success.
When researching retail stores, such as restaurant chains (for example,
McDonald’s) or clothing stores (such as The Gap), examine the revenue
changes that come from opening new locations versus the changes at exist-
ing locations, sometimes referred to as same stores. Be concerned if you find
that a company’s revenue growth largely comes from opening new locations
rather than growth at existing locations.
Expenses
Just as personal income taxes, housing, food, and clothing expenses gobble
up much of your personal income, company expenses use up much and
sometimes all of a company’s revenue.
132
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

Source: T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. 2004 Annual Report
Even healthy, growing businesses can get into trouble if their expenses bal-
loon faster than their revenue. Well-managed companies stay on top of their
expenses during good and bad times. Unfortunately, it’s easy for companies
to get sloppy during good times.
It’s particularly useful to examine each category of expenses relative to (in
other words, as a percentage of) the company’s revenue to see which grow or
shrink. As a well-managed and financially healthy company grows, expenses
as a percentage of revenue should decrease. As this happens, profits as a per-
centage of revenue increase. This has been the case with T. Rowe Price over
this time period.

Net income calculations
The net result of expense increasing slower than revenues is a fatter bottom
line. In T. Rowe Price’s case, net income increased from 21.0 percent to 26.4
percent of revenue between 2002 and 2004. When you examine how a com-
pany’s profits change relative to total revenue received, focus on operating
income. Sometimes companies experience one-time events that can change
profits temporarily. Companies usually list these one-time events in the sec-
tion under expenses.
Earnings per share
Last but not least, and of great importance to shareholders, is the calculation
of earnings per share. Higher profits per share generally help fuel a higher
stock price, and declining profits feed falling stock prices. Remember, though,
that smart financial market participants are looking ahead, so if you run out
to buy stock in a company that is reporting higher profits, it’s old news and
likely already priced into the company’s current market value.
Exploring Other Useful Corporate Reports
In addition to annual reports, companies produce other financial statements
that you may want to peruse. You can generally obtain these from the com-
pany for free or from the Securities and Exchange Commission Web site,
www.sec.gov. (See Chapter 19 for more on this site.)

Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

10-Ks
10-Ks are expanded versions of an annual report. Most investment profession-
als read the 10-K instead of the annual report because the 10-K contains addi-
tional data and information, especially for a company’s various divisions and
product lines. Also, 10-Ks contain little of the verbal hype that you find in
most annual reports. The 10-K is probably one of the most objective reports
that a company publishes. If you’re not intimidated by annual reports, or you
want more company meat, go for it!
10-Qs
10-Qs provide information similar to the 10-K but on a quarterly basis. 10-Qs
are worthwhile if you like to read a reasonably detailed discussion by man-
agement of the latest business and financial developments at the company.
However, I recommend leaving the research to Value Line’s analysts.
The financial data in these reports is unaudited and not of great use for the
long-term investor. If you want to watch your investments like a hawk and try
to be among the first to detect indications of financial problems (easier said
than done), this report is required reading.
Many companies go back to restate their quarterly financials. Remember that
the accountants haven’t approved these numbers. Sometimes companies
take their financial lumps in one quarter to get problems behind them, so
one bad quarter doesn’t necessarily indicate a harmful long-term trend.
Proxies
The final corporate document that you may want to review is the annual
proxy statement, which is sent out in advance of a company’s annual meeting.
The proxy statement contains some of the more important financial informa-
tion and discussions that you can find in the 10-K. It also contains information
on other corporate matters, such as the election of the board of directors.
Directors — who are usually corporate executives, lawyers, accountants, and
other knowledgeable luminaries — serve as sounding boards, counselors,
and sometimes overseers to the management team of a company.
The proxy statement becomes much more important when a company faces
a takeover or some other controversial corporate matter, such as the election
of an alternative board of directors.
135
Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks

The proxy tells you who serves on the board of directors as well as how
much they and the executives of the company are paid. At annual meetings,
where the board of directors discusses proxy statements, shareholders
sometimes get angry and ask why the executives are paid so much when the
company’s stock price and business underperform.
Getting Ready to Invest in Stocks
Especially during the late 1990s, amidst the chorus of self-anointed gurus
saying that you can make fat profits if you pick your own stocks, I sometimes
thought that I was a lone voice urging caution and sensible thinking.
Unless you’re extraordinarily lucky or unusually gifted at analyzing company
and investor behavior, you won’t earn above-average returns if you select
your own stocks.
Keep to a minimum — ideally, no more than 20 percent of your invested 
dollars — the amount that you dedicate to individual stock investments. I
encourage you to do such investing for the educational value and enjoyment
136
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Fundamental versus technical analysis
Throughout this chapter and the last, I talk a lot
about the financial statements of a company —
balance sheets, revenues, expenses, earnings,
price/earnings ratios, and so on. Analyzing
financial statements and making investing deci-
sions based on them is known as fundamental
analysis. But another school of stock market
analysis, known as technical analysis, exists.
Folks who employ technical analysis like to
examine chart patterns, volume, and all sorts of
indicators that have little if anything to do with
the underlying stock.
Technicians say things like “Stock XYZ has a
major support area at $20 per share” and
“Stock ABC has broken out above $30 per
share.” Although it may be a bit extreme to say
that all the technicians who have ever existed
have never produced anything of value, you can
safely ignore this school of thinking. In fact,
ignoring the technicians will likely increase your
stock market profits. Why? Because technical
analysis thinking encourages a trader’s, not an
investor’s, mindset.
Not surprisingly, most technicians come from
one of two camps. Many technical analysts
work for brokerage firms and write daily,
weekly, or monthly assessments of the entire
stock market and some individual stocks.
Recommendations and advice change over
time, and the result is that you trade more. Not
coincidentally, these brokerage firms make
more money the more you trade! Investment
newsletter writers are the other big advocates
of this Ouija-board approach to investment
management. Again, it’s a great system for the
newsletter writers who hook you on a $200-per-
year monthly newsletter.

that you derive from it, not because you smugly think you’re smarter than
the best professional money managers. (If you want to find out more about
analyzing companies, read the chapters in Part IV on small business as well
as the investing-resources chapters in Part V.)
Understanding stock prices
Most major newspapers print a listing of the prior day’s stock prices (unless
you live in an area with a late afternoon paper that publishes that day’s activ-
ity). Daily business papers such as The Wall Street Journal and Investor’s
Business Daily publish stock prices daily. Likewise, just about every major
financial site on the Internet offers stock prices (usually for free as a lure to
get you to visit the site). To view a stock price quote online, all you need is
the security’s trading symbol (which you obtain by looking up the company’s
name, if you don’t already know it).
For a thrill, you can stop by a local brokerage office and see the current stock
quotes whizzing by on a long, narrow screen on a wall. Stock market channels
on cable television often have this ticker-tape screen running on the bottom
of your television tube. Many brokerage firms also maintain publicly accessi-
ble terminals (that look a lot like a personal computer) on which you can
obtain current quotes for free.
The following table is a typical example of the kinds of information that you
can find in daily price quotes in papers and online — in this case, for the
computer behemoth International Business Machines (also known as Big
Blue or IBM). After the name of the company, you see the trading symbol,
IBM, which is the code that you and brokers use to look up the price on 
computer-based quotation systems.

Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks

Here’s a breakdown of what this information means:
 52-Week Range: These two numbers indicate the low ($73.25) and high
($126.39) trading prices for IBM during the past 52 weeks.
 Last Trade: This line indicates the most recent price that the stock
traded at (you can see that I happened to get this IBM quote at 1:37 p.m.,
which is assumed to be Eastern Standard Time).
 Change: This entry indicates how that price differs from the previous
day’s close. In this case, you can see that the stock was down 0.81 points
(1.07 percent) from the prior day’s close.
 Day’s Range: These two numbers are lowest and highest prices that the
stock traded at during the day. 
 Open: This line tells you the trade price at the market’s open.
 Volume: This number indicates the number of shares that traded
through this point in the trading day. (To conserve space, many newspa-
pers indicate the volume in hundreds of shares — in other words, you
must add two zeros to the end of the number to arrive at the actual
number of shares.)
 The P/E ratio: As I explain in Chapters 4 and 5, the P/E ratio measures
the price of IBM’s stock relative to the company’s earnings or profits.
 Market capitalization: This tells you the current market value of all of
IBM’s stock, which in this case is $128 billion. It is arrived at by multiply-
ing the current price per share by the total number of shares outstanding.
(See Chapter 8 for an explanation of so-called market caps as they apply
to stocks and stock funds.)
 Dividends/share: This shows you the current dividend, which in this
case is $0.60 per share, which the company pays yearly to shareholders.
Most companies actually pay out one-quarter of their total annual divi-
dend every three months.
 Yield: This number indicates the effective percentage yield that the
stock’s dividend produces. To calculate the effective yield, divide the
dividend by the current stock price. Thus, IBM shareholders can expect
to receive a dividend worth about 0.8 percent of the current stock value.
Now you know how to read stock quotes!
Purchasing stock “direct” from companies
Over the years, increasing numbers of companies have begun to sell their
stock directly to the public. Proponents of these direct stock purchase plans
say that you can invest in stocks without paying any commissions. This isn’t
quite true, and investing in such plans poses other challenges.
138
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

If you want to purchase directly from Home Depot, for example, you need a
minimum initial investment of $250. Buying stock “direct” isn’t free — in the
case of Home Depot, for example, you will be charged a $5 enrollment fee.
Although that may not sound like much on a $250 investment, $5 represents
2 percent of your investment. For subsequent purchases, you pay 5 percent
up to a maximum of $2.50 per purchase plus 5 cents per share. And although
you can reinvest your dividends from Home Depot directly in buying more
shares of its stock, you have to pay the same fee you must pay for any subse-
quent purchase. If you want to sell your shares, you need to pay a fee to do
that, too — $10 plus 15 cents per share. Overall, these fees compare to what
you would pay to buy stock through a discount broker (see Chapter 21). And
in some cases, these fees are higher! For example, you can reinvest dividends
at no cost through many discount brokers.
Some direct stock purchase plans entail even more hassle and cost than the
type I just discussed. With other plans, you must buy your initial shares
through a broker and then transfer your shares to the issuing company in
order to buy more! Also, most direct stock purchase plans can’t be done
within retirement accounts.
Every time that you want to set up a stock purchase plan with a company,
you must request and complete the company’s application forms. If you go
through the headache of doing so, say, a dozen times, you’re rewarded with a
dozen statements on a regular basis from each individual company. Frankly,
because of this drawback alone, I prefer to buy stock through a discount bro-
kerage account that allows centralized purchasing and holding of various
stocks as well as consolidated tax-reporting statements.
A small number of companies offer investors the ability to reinvest dividends
as well as make additional stock purchases at a discount of 1 to 5 percent
from the current market price of their stock. Buying stock at a discount gets
me more excited, but the previously listed drawbacks still apply. The compa-
nies that offer such plans tend to be smaller, run-of-the-mill utilities and
banks, so you can’t build a diversified, high-quality portfolio this way.
Skip direct stock purchase plans. If you want to buy good individual stocks,
invest through your retirement accounts and in tax-friendly stocks outside
your retirement accounts.
Placing your trade through a broker
Unless you decide to buy stock directly, you generally need a broker. As I
explain in Chapter 9, discount brokers are the best way to go — they take
your orders and charge far less than conventional brokerage firms, which pay
their brokers on commission.
139
Chapter 6: Investigating and Purchasing Individual Stocks

After you decide which discount broker you want to use (again, I provide all
the info you need to make this decision in Chapter 9), request (by phone or
via the Internet) an account application package for the type of account that
you desire (non-retirement, IRA, Keogh, and so on). Complete the forms (call
the firm’s toll-free number or visit a branch office if you get stuck) and mail or
take them back to the discounter.
When it comes time to place your order, simply call the discount broker and
explain what you want to do (or use your touch-tone phone or computer to
place your order). You have two options:
 Market order: My advice is to place what’s known as a market order.
Such an order instructs your broker to buy you the amount of stock that
you desire (100 shares, for example) at the current and best (lowest)
price available.
 Limit order: Alternatively, you can try to buy a desired stock at a specific
price — for example, you can place a purchase order at $32 per share
when the stock’s last trade was $33 per share. This type of order is known
as a limit order and is good until you cancel it. I don’t recommend that you
try this tactic because it requires you to hope and gamble that the stock
drops a little before it rises. If the stock simply rises from its current price
of $33 per share or drops to $321⁄8 before it goes on a big increase, you may
kick yourself. If you think that the stock is a good buy for the long haul, go
buy it with a market order. If you don’t think it’s a good buy, don’t buy it.
One final word of advice: Try to buy stock in decent-size chunks, such as 100
shares. Otherwise, commissions gobble a large percentage of the small dollar
amount that you invest. If you don’t have enough money to build a diversified
portfolio all at once, don’t sweat it. Diversify over time. Purchase a chunk of
one stock after you have enough money accumulated and then wait to buy
the next stock until you’ve saved another chunk to invest.

L
ending investments are those in which you lend your money to an organi-
zation, such as a company or government, which typically pays you a set
or fixed rate of interest. (Ownership investments, by contrast, provide partial
ownership of a company or some other asset, such as real estate, that has
the ability to generate revenue and potential profits.)
If you really desire to make your money grow, lending investments aren’t for
you. However, even the most-aggressive investors should consider placing
some of their money into lending investments. Table 7-1 shows when such
investments make and don’t make sense.
Lending investments are everywhere — through banks, brokerage firms,
insurance companies, and mutual fund companies. Lending investments that
you may have heard of include bank accounts (savings and certificates of
deposit), Treasury bills and other bonds, bond mutual funds, mortgages, and
guaranteed-investment contracts.
In this chapter, I walk you through these investments and explain what’s good
and bad about each of them and when you should and shouldn’t use them. I
also tell you what to look for (and look out for) when comparing them.

Banks: The Cost of Feeling Secure
Putting your money in a bank may make you feel safe for a variety of reasons.
If you’re like most people, your first investing experience was at your neighbor-
hood bank where you established a checking and savings account. Depending
on your situation, this event may have happened as early as elementary or
junior high school or as late as college or post-college.
Part of the comfort of keeping money in the bank stems from the fact that the
bank is where many of our parents first steered us financially. Also, at a local
branch, often within walking distance of your home or office, you find vaults,
security-monitoring cameras, and barriers in front of the tellers. Most of
these latter accoutrements shouldn’t make you feel safer about leaving your
money with the bank — they’re needed because of bank robberies and the
preponderance of guns in our society. Consider that the next time you pay a
visit to your local bank.
Bank branches cost a lot of money to operate. Guess where that money
comes from? From you, of course! That’s one of the reasons why the interest
rates that banks pay often pale in comparison to secure alternatives.
142
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

The realities of bank insurance
Some people are consoled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC) insurance that comes with bank accounts. It’s true that if your bank
fails, your account is insured up to $100,000. So what, I say. Any Treasury
bond is issued and backed by the federal government — the same $7 trillion-
debt-ridden organization that stands behind the FDIC. Plenty of other equally
safe lending investments yield higher returns.
Just because the federal government stands behind the banking FDIC system
doesn’t mean that your money is 100 percent safe in the event of a bank fail-
ure. And even if you’re paid back, you may not be paid back in full or paid
back with dollars worth anywhere near what a dollar is worth today. Banks
fail and will continue to fail. During the 1980s and 1990s, hundreds of insured
banks and savings and loans failed annually. Although you’re insured for
$100,000 in a bank, if the bank crashes, you may wait quite a while to get your
money back — and you may well get less interest than you thought you would.
Any investment that involves lending your money to someone else or to
some organization carries risk. That includes putting your money in a bank
or buying a Treasury bond that the federal government issues. Although I’m
not a doomsayer, any student of history knows that governments and civiliza-
tions fail. It’s not a matter of whether they will fail; it’s a question of when.
The overused certificate of deposit (CD)
Other than savings accounts, banks also sell certificates of deposit (CDs).
CDs are without a doubt the most overused bank investment around. The
attraction is that you get a higher rate of return on a CD than on a bank sav-
ings or money market account. And unlike a bond, which I discuss in the
“Why Bother with Bonds?” section, later in the chapter, a CD’s principal value
doesn’t fluctuate. CDs also give you the peace of mind afforded by the govern-
ment’s FDIC insurance program.
The reason that CDs pay higher interest rates than savings accounts is that you
commit to tie up your money for a period of time, such as 6, 12, or 24 months.
The bank pays you 2 to 3 percent and then turns around and lends your money
to people through credit cards, auto loans, and the like and charges the bor-
rower an interest rate of 10-plus percent. Not a bad business, eh?
When you tie up your money in a CD, you make a sacrifice. If you want it back
before the CD matures, a hefty penalty (about six months’ interest) is shaved
from your return. With other lending investments, such as bonds and bond
143
Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments

mutual funds (discussed in the section “Why Bother with Bonds?”, later in
this chapter), you can access your money without penalty and generally at
little or no cost.
In addition to penalties for early withdrawal, CDs yield less than a high-quality
bond with a comparable maturity (for example, two, five, or ten years). Often,
the yield difference is 1 percent or more, especially if you don’t shop around
and simply buy CDs from the local bank where you keep your checking account.
High-tax-bracket investors who purchase CDs outside of their retirement
accounts should be aware of a final and perhaps fatal flaw of CDs: The inter-
est on CDs is fully taxable at the federal and state levels. Bonds, by contrast,
are available (if you desire) in tax-free (federal and/or state) versions.
You can earn higher returns and have better access to your money in bonds
than in CDs. Bonds make especially good sense when you’re in a higher tax
bracket and would benefit from tax-free income in a non-retirement account.
CDs make the most sense when you know, for example, that you can invest
your money for one year, after which you need the money for some purchase
that you expect to make. Just make sure that you shop around to get the best
interest rate. If having the U.S. government insurance gives you peace of
mind, take a look at Treasury bonds, which I discuss later in this chapter.
Treasury bonds (also known as Treasuries) tend to pay more interest than
many other available CDs.
The money market fund alternative 
to savings accounts
I don’t keep extra savings in the bank. Because bank savings accounts gener-
ally pay pretty crummy interest rates, you need to think long and hard about
keeping spare cash in the bank.
You can, if you so choose, keep your checking account at your local bank. (I
don’t because I use a money market fund that offers unlimited check writing
at a mutual fund company.)
Money market funds, which are a type of mutual fund (other common funds
focus on bonds or stocks), are a great place to keep your extra savings.
Money market funds offer a higher-yielding alternative to bank savings and
bank money market deposit accounts.
Money market funds, which are offered by mutual fund companies (see
Chapter 8), are unique among mutual funds because they don’t fluctuate in
value and maintain a fixed $1-per-share price. As with a bank savings account,
your principal investment in a money market fund doesn’t change in value. If
you invest your money in a money fund, it earns dividends (which is just
another name for the interest you would receive in a bank account).
144
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

Money market fund advantages
The best money market mutual funds offer several significant benefits over
bank savings accounts. The biggest advantage is higher yields. Money market
mutual funds pay higher yields because they don’t have the high overhead
that banks do. The most efficient mutual fund companies (I discuss them in
Chapter 8) don’t have scads of branch offices on every street corner. Another
reason that banks can get away with paying lower yields is that they know
that many depositors, perhaps including you, believe that the FDIC insurance
that comes with a bank savings account makes it safer than a money market
mutual fund. Also, the FDIC insurance is an expense that banks ultimately
pass on to their customers.
Another advantage of money market funds over bank accounts is that money
funds come in a variety of tax-free versions. So if you’re in a high tax bracket
(see Chapter 3), tax-free money market funds offer you something that bank
accounts don’t.
Another useful feature of money market mutual funds is the ability to write
checks, without charge, against your account. Most mutual fund companies
require that the checks that you write be for larger amounts — typically at
least $250. They don’t want you using these accounts to pay all your small
household bills because checks cost money to process.
Money market funds are a good place to keep your emergency cash reserve
of at least three to six months’ living expenses. They’re also a great place to
keep money awaiting investment elsewhere in the near future. If you’re saving
money for a home that you expect to purchase soon (in the next year or so),
a money fund can be a safe place to accumulate and grow the down payment.
You don’t want to risk placing such money in the stock market, because the
market can plunge in a relatively short period of time.
Just as you can use a money market fund for your personal purposes, you
can open a money market fund for your business. I have one for my business.
You can use this account to deposit checks that you receive from customers,
to hold excess funds, and to pay bills via the check-writing feature.
A few money market funds (such as those that brokerage cash management
accounts at firms such as Charles Schwab, TD Waterhouse, Vanguard, and
Fidelity offer) allow you to write checks for any amount and can completely
replace a bank checking account. Some brokerage firms will hit you with ser-
vice fees if you don’t have enough assets with them or you don’t have regular
monthly electronic transfers, such as through direct deposit of your pay-
check or money transfer from your bank account. With these types of money
market funds, you can leave your bank altogether because these brokerage
accounts often come with debit cards that you can use at bank ATMs for a
nominal fee.
145
Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments

Money funds lack insurance
Higher yields, tax-free alternatives, and check writing — it almost sounds too
good to be true. What’s the catch? Good money market funds really don’t
have any, but you need to know about an important difference between bank
accounts and money market mutual funds: Money funds aren’t insured. As I
discuss earlier in this chapter, bank accounts come with FDIC insurance that
protects your deposited money up to $100,000. So if a bank fails because it
lends too much money to people and companies that go bankrupt or abscond
with the funds, you should get your money back from the FDIC.
The lack of FDIC insurance on a money fund shouldn’t trouble you. Mutual fund
companies can’t fail because they have a dollar invested in securities for every
dollar that you deposit in their money funds. By contrast, banks are required to
have available just 12 cents for every dollar that you hand over to them.
A money market fund’s investments can decline slightly in value, which can
cause the money fund’s share price to fall below a dollar. A few cases have
occurred where money market funds bought some bad investments. However,
in each and every case except one, the parent company running the money
fund infused cash into the affected fund, thus enabling it to maintain the 
$1-per-share price.
One money market fund did “break the buck.” It didn’t take money in from
people like you or me but was run by a bunch of small banks for themselves.
This money market fund made some boneheaded investments. The share
price of the fund declined by 6 percent, and the fund owners decided to dis-
band the fund; they didn’t bail it out because they would only have been
repaying themselves.
Stick with bigger mutual fund companies if you’re worried about the lack of
FDIC insurance. They have the financial wherewithal and the largest incentive
to save a floundering money fund. Fortunately, the bigger fund companies
have the best money funds anyway. You can find more details about money
market funds in Chapter 8.
Why Bother with Bonds?
In the 1920s, Andrew Mellon said, “Gentlemen prefer bonds.” I’ve never fig-
ured out why, and I’m convinced that Mr. Mellon wasn’t serious or sober
when he said this. My observation is that conservative investors prefer
bonds (that is, conservative when it comes to taking risk, not when professing
146
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

their political orientation). Otherwise-aggressive investors who seek diversifi-
cation or investments for shorter-term financial goals also prefer bonds. The
reason: Bonds offer higher yields than bank accounts without as much
volatility as the stock market.
Bonds are similar to CDs. For example, you can purchase a bond, scheduled
to mature five years from now, that a company such as the retailing behe-
moth Wal-Mart issues. A Wal-Mart five-year bond may pay you 6 percent
interest. The company sends you interest payments on the bond for five
years. And as long as Wal-Mart doesn’t have a financial catastrophe, the com-
pany returns your original investment to you after the five years is up. So in
effect, you’re loaning your money to Wal-Mart (instead of the bank when you
deposit money in a bank account).
The worst that can happen to your bond investment is that Wal-Mart’s busi-
ness goes into a tailspin and the company ends up in financial ruin — also
known as bankruptcy. If that happens, you may lose all your original invest-
ment and miss out on the remaining interest payments you were supposed to
receive.
But bonds that high-quality companies such as Wal-Mart issue are quite safe —
they rarely default. Besides, you don’t have to invest all your money in just
one or two bonds. If you own bonds in many companies and one bond unex-
pectedly takes a hit, it affects only a small portion of your portfolio. And
unlike CDs, you can generally sell your bonds anytime you desire at minimal
cost. (Selling and buying most bond mutual funds costs nothing, as I explain
in Chapter 8.)
Bond investors accept the risk of default because bonds generally pay you
more than bank savings and money market mutual funds, but there is a catch.
As I discuss later in this chapter, bonds are riskier than money market funds
and savings accounts because their value can fall if interest rates rise. Plus
you’re forgoing the security of FDIC insurance as compared to bank accounts.
However, bonds tend to be more stable in value than stocks. (I cover the
risks and returns of bonds and stocks in Chapter 2.)
Investing in bonds is a time-honored way to earn a better rate of return on
money that you don’t plan to use within the next couple of years or more. As
with stocks, bonds can generally be sold any day that the financial markets
are open. Because their value fluctuates, though, you’re more likely to lose
money if you’re forced to sell your bonds sooner rather than later. In the
short term, if the bond market happens to fall and you need to sell, you could
lose money. In the longer-term, as is the case with stocks, you’re far less
likely to lose money.
147
Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments

Don’t put your emergency cash reserve into bonds — that’s what a money
market fund or bank savings account is for. And don’t put too much of your
longer-term investment money into bonds, either. As I explain in Chapter 2,
bonds are generally inferior investments for making your money grow.
Growth-oriented investments, such as stocks, real estate, and your own 
business, hold the greatest potential to build real wealth.
The following list provides some common financial goals and reasons why
investing some money in bonds can make sense:
 A major purchase: This purchase should be one that won’t happen for
at least two years, such as buying a home or some other major expendi-
ture. Shorter-term bonds may work for you as a higher-yielding and
slightly riskier alternative to money market funds.
 Diversification: Bonds don’t move in tandem with the performance of
other types of investments, such as stocks. In fact, in a terrible eco-
nomic environment (such as during the Great Depression), bonds may
appreciate in value while riskier investments such as stocks plunge.
 Retirement investments: You may invest some of your money in bonds
as part of a longer-term investment strategy, such as for retirement. You
should have an overall plan for how you want to invest your money,
sometimes referred to as an asset allocation strategy (see Chapter 8).
Aggressive, younger investors should keep less of their retirement
money in bonds than older folks who are nearing retirement.
 Income-producing investments: If you’re retired or not working, bonds
can be useful because they’re better at producing current income than
many other investments.
Assessing the Different Types of Bonds
Bonds aren’t as complicated and unique as people, but they’re certainly more
complex than a bank savings account. And thanks to shady marketing prac-
tices by some investing companies and salespeople who sell bonds, you can
have your work cut out for you while trying to get a handle on what many
bonds really are and how they differ from their peers.
Bonds differ from one another according to a number of factors — length to
maturity, credit quality, and the entities that issue the bonds (the latter of
which has associated tax implications that you need to be aware of). After
you have a handle on these issues, you’re ready to consider investing in indi-
vidual bonds and bond mutual funds.

Determining when you get your 
money back: Maturity matters
Maturity simply means the time at which the bond pays back your principal —
next year, in 5 years, in 30 years, and so on. You need to care how long it takes
a bond to mature because a bond’s maturity gives you a good (although far-
from-perfect) sense of how volatile a bond may be if interest rates change. If
interest rates fall, bond prices rise; if interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Longer-
term bonds drop more in price when the overall level of interest rates rise.
Suppose that you’re considering investing in two bonds that the same organi-
zation issues, and both yield 7 percent. The bonds differ from one another only
in when they will mature: One is a 2-year bond; the other, a 20-year bond. If
interest rates were to rise just 1 percent (from 7 percent to 8 percent), the 
2-year bond might decline about 2 percent in value, whereas the 20-year bond
could fall approximately 5 times as much — 10 percent.
If you hold a bond until it matures, you get your principal back unless the
issuer defaults. In the meantime, however, if interest rates rise, bond prices
fall. The reason is simple: If the bond that you hold is issued at, say, 7 per-
cent, and interest rates on similar bonds rise to 8 percent, no one (unless
they don’t know any better) wants to purchase your 7 percent bond. The
value of your bond has to decrease enough so that it effectively yields 
8 percent.
Bonds are generally classified by the length of time until maturity:
 Short-term bonds mature in the next few years.
 Intermediate-term bonds come due within three to ten years.
 Long-term bonds mature in more than 10 years and generally up to 30
years. Although rare, a number of companies issue 100-year bonds! A
number of railroads did, as well as Disney and Coca-Cola during the
1990s. Such bonds are quite dangerous to purchase, especially if they’re
issued during a period of relatively low interest rates.
Most of the time, longer-term bonds pay higher yields than short-term bonds.
You can look at a chart of the current yield of similar bonds plotted against
when they mature — such a chart is known as a yield curve. At most times,
this curve slopes upward. Investors generally demand a higher rate of inter-
est for taking the risk of holding longer-term bonds. Most financial news-
papers, magazines, and Web sites carry a current chart of the yield curve.

Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments

Weighing the likelihood of default
In addition to being issued for various lengths of time, bonds differ from one
another in the creditworthiness of the issuer. Every year, billions of dollars’
worth of bonds default. To minimize investing in bonds that default, purchase
high-credit, quality bonds. Credit rating agencies such as Moody’s, Standard
& Poor’s, and Duff & Phelps rate the credit quality and likelihood of default 
of bonds.
The credit rating of a bond depends on the issuer’s (company or government)
ability to pay back its debt. Bond credit ratings are usually done on some
sort of a letter-grade scale where AAA is the highest rating, with ratings
descending through AA and A, followed by BBB, BB, B, CCC, CC, C, and so on.
 AAA- and AA-rated bonds are considered high-grade or high-credit qual-
ity bonds. Such bonds possess little chance — a fraction of 1 percent —
of default.
 A- and BBB-rated bonds are considered general-grade or general-quality
bonds.
 BB- or lower-rated bonds are known as junk bonds (or by their mar-
keted name, high-yield bonds). Junk bonds are more likely to default —
perhaps as many as a couple of percent per year actually default.
You may ask yourself why any right-minded investor would buy a bond
with a low credit rating. That’s because companies pay a higher interest
rate on lower-quality bonds to attract investors. The lower a bond’s
credit rating and quality, the higher the yield you can and should expect
from such a bond. Poorer-quality bonds, though, are not for the faint of
heart because they’re generally more volatile in value.
I don’t recommend buying individual junk bonds — consider investing in
these only through a junk-bond fund.
Examining the issuers (and 
tax implications)
Bonds also differ from one another according to the type of organization that
issues them — in other words, what kind of organization you lend your money
to. The following sections go over the major options and let you know when
each option may make sense for you.
150
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

Treasury bonds
Treasuries are IOUs from the biggest debtor of them all, the U.S. government.
The types of Treasury bonds include Treasury bills (which mature within a
year), Treasury notes (which mature between one and ten years), and
Treasury bonds (which mature in more than ten years). These distinctions
and delineations are arbitrary — you don’t need to know them for an exam.
Treasuries pay interest that is state-tax-free but federally taxable. Thus, they
make sense if you want to avoid a high state-income-tax bracket but not a
high federal-income-tax bracket. However, most people in a high state-
income-tax bracket also happen to be in a high federal-income-tax bracket.
Such high-tax-bracket investors may be better off in municipal bonds
(explained in the next section), which are both federal- and state-tax-free.
The best use of Treasuries is in place of bank CDs. If you feel secure with the
federal government insurance that a bank CD provides, check out a Treasury
bond. Treasuries that mature in the same length of time as a CD almost
always pay the same or a better interest rate. If you hunt around, you may
stumble upon a bank that pays a slightly higher interest rate than a compara-
ble Treasury bond. Just remember that bank CD interest is fully taxable,
whereas a Treasury’s interest is state-tax-free. Unless you really shop for a
bank CD, you will likely earn a lower return on a CD than on a Treasury. I
explain how to purchase Treasury bonds in the section “Buying Treasuries,”
later in this chapter.
Municipal bonds
Municipal bonds are state and local government bonds that pay interest
that’s federal-tax-free and state-tax-free to residents in the state of issue. For
example, if you live in California and buy a bond issued by a California gov-
ernment agency, you probably won’t owe California state or federal income
tax on the interest.
The government organizations that issue municipal bonds know that the
investors who buy municipals don’t have to pay most or any of the income
tax that is normally required on other bonds — which means that the issuing
governments can get away with paying a lower rate of interest.
If you’re in a high tax bracket and you want to invest in bonds outside tax-
sheltered retirement accounts, you may end up with a higher after-tax yield
from a municipal bond (often called muni) than a comparable bond that pays
taxable interest. Compare the yield on a given municipal bond (or muni bond
fund) to the after-tax yield on a comparable taxable bond (or bond fund).
151
Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments

Some people worry about the impact that passage of a flat tax on their
municipal bonds would impose. Under some of the proposed versions of the
flat tax, all interest earned on investments wouldn’t be taxed. Thus, muni
bonds would lose their tax-free advantage versus other bonds. If such a flat
tax were to pass, the price of municipal bonds, particularly longer-term ones,
could fall significantly. That’s why, like many radically proposed reforms in
the tax laws, a flat tax is highly unlikely to ever be passed by Congress and
signed into law.
Corporate bonds
Companies such as General Motors, Home Depot, and Johnson & Johnson
issue corporate bonds. Corporate bonds pay interest that’s fully taxable.
Thus, they’re appropriate for investing inside retirement accounts. Only
lower-tax-bracket investors should consider buying such bonds outside a tax-
sheltered retirement account. (Higher-bracket investors should instead con-
sider municipal bonds.) In the section “Understanding bond prices,” later in
this chapter, I show you how to read the newspaper listings for such bonds. If
you buy corporate bonds through a well-managed mutual fund, an approach I
advocate, you don’t need to read the newspaper listings.
Mortgage bonds
Remember that mortgage you took out when you purchased your home?
Well, you can actually purchase a bond to invest in a portfolio of mortgages
just like yours! Many banks actually sell their mortgages as bonds in the
financial markets, which allows other investors to invest in them. The repay-
ment of principal on such bonds is usually guaranteed at the bond’s maturity
by a government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage
Association (GNMA, also known as Ginnie Mae) or the Federal National
Mortgage Association (FNMA, also known as Fannie Mae).
Convertible bonds
Convertible bonds are hybrid securities — they’re bonds that you can convert
under specified circumstance into a preset number of shares of stock in the
company that issued the bond. Although these bonds do pay interest, their
yield is lower than nonconvertible bonds because convertibles offer you 
the upside potential of being able to make more money if the underlying
stock rises.
Inflation-indexed Treasury bonds
The U.S. government now offers inflation-indexed Treasury bonds. Compared
with traditional Treasury bonds, the inflation-indexed bonds carry a lower
interest rate. The reason is that the other portion of your return with these
inflation-indexed bonds comes from the inflation adjustment to the principal
152
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

you invest. The inflation portion of the return gets added back into principal.
For example, if inflation were 3 percent the first year you hold your inflation-
indexed bond into which you invested $10,000, your principal would increase
to $10,300 at the end of the first year.
What’s appealing about these newer bonds is that no matter what happens
with the rate of inflation, investors who buy inflation-indexed bonds will
always earn a decent return (the yield or interest rate paid) above and
beyond the rate of inflation. Thus, holders of inflation-indexed Treasuries
can’t have the purchasing power of their principal or interest eroded by high
inflation.
Because inflation-indexed Treasuries protect the investor from the ravages of
inflation, they represent a less risky security. As I discuss in Chapter 2, lower
risk usually translates into lower returns. You should also know that these
bonds are less attractive for investors seeking more income to live on
because a portion of the return, which is for increases in the cost of living, is
added to the bond’s principal.
Buying Bonds
You can invest in bonds in one of two major ways: You can purchase individ-
ual bonds, or you can invest in a professionally selected and managed portfo-
lio of bonds via a bond mutual fund. In this section, I help you make that
decision and promptly send you to Chapter 8 should you fall on the side of
153
Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments
International bonds
You can buy bonds outside the country that you
call home. If you live in the United States, for
example, you can buy most of the bonds that I
describe in this chapter from foreign issuers as
well. International bonds are riskier to you
because their interest payments can be offset
by currency price changes.
The prices of foreign bonds tend not to move in
tandem with U.S. bonds. Foreign bond values
benefit from and thus protect against a declining
U.S. dollar and, therefore, offer some diversifi-
cation value. That said, foreign bonds aren’t a
vital holding for a diversified portfolio. Foreign
bonds are generally more expensive to purchase
and hold than comparable domestic bonds.

mutual funds. If you want to take the individual-bond route, I cover that path
here, where I explain how to decipher bond listings you find in financial news-
papers or online and the purchasing process for Treasuries (a different animal
in that you can buy them directly from the government) and all other bonds.
Deciding between individual 
bonds and bond mutual funds
Unless the bonds you’re considering purchasing are easy to analyze and homo-
geneous (such as Treasury bonds), you’re generally better off investing in
bonds through a mutual fund. The first reason is diversification. You shouldn’t
put your money into a small number of bonds that companies in the same
industry issue or that mature at the same time. It’s difficult to cost-effectively
build a diversified bond portfolio with individual issues unless you have a
substantial amount of money ($1 million) that you want to invest in bonds.
If you purchase individual bonds through a broker, you’re going to pay a com-
mission. In most cases, the commission cost is hidden — the broker quotes
you a price for the bond that includes the commission. Even if you use a dis-
count broker, these fees take a healthy bite out of your investment. The
smaller the amount that you invest, the bigger the bite — on a $1,000 bond,
the commission fee can equal up to 5 percent. Commissions take a smaller
bite out of larger bonds — perhaps less than 0.5 percent if you use discount
brokers.
The best reason to invest in bond funds instead of individual bonds is that
you’ve got better things to do with your time. Do you really want to research
bonds and go bond shopping? Bonds are boring! And bonds and the compa-
nies that stand behind them aren’t that simple to understand. For example,
did you know that some bonds can be called before their maturity date?
154
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Zero coupon bonds
Some bonds that you may have heard of or 
are interested in have unusual features. For
example, not all bonds make regular interest
payments. A zero coupon bond is sold at a 
substantial discount to its future maturity 
value. Thus, an investor in a zero coupon bond
implicitly earns interest if the value of the bond
should rise over time to reach full value by
maturity. Zero coupon bonds are highly sensi-
tive to interest rate changes, which is why I
don’t generally recommend them.

Companies often call bonds (which means they repay the principal before
maturity) to save money if interest rates drop significantly. After you pur-
chase a bond, you need to do the same things that a good bond mutual fund
portfolio manager needs to do, such as track the issuer’s creditworthiness
and monitor other important financial developments.
A final reason to invest in bonds through a mutual fund is that it’s cost effec-
tive. Great bond funds are yours for less than 0.5 percent per year in operat-
ing expenses. Selecting good bond funds isn’t hard, as I explain in Chapter 8.
Understanding bond prices
Most daily newspapers don’t publish the prices of individual bonds because
they don’t possess a lot of interest in devoting their limited space to bonds.
More business-focused publications, such as The Wall Street Journal, provide
daily bond pricing. You may also call a broker or browse Web sites to obtain
bond prices. The following steps walk you through the bond listing for PhilEl
(Philadelphia Electric) in Figure 7-1:
1. Bond name: This tells you who issued the bond. In this case, the issuer
is a large utility company, Philadelphia Electric.
2. Funny numbers after company name: The first part of the numerical
sequence here — 71⁄8 — refers to the original interest rate (7.125 percent)
that this bond paid when it was issued. This interest rate is known as
the coupon rate. The second part of the numbers — 23 — refers to the
year that the bond matures (2023, in this case).

Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments

3. Current yield: Divide the interest paid, 7.125, by the current price per
share, $93, to arrive at the current yield. In this case, it equals (rounded
off) 7.7 percent.
4. Volume: Indicates the number of bonds that traded on this day.
5. Close: Shows the last price that the bond traded at.
6. Change: Indicates how this day’s close compares with the previous day’s
close. In this case, this bond rose 21⁄8 points, a pretty healthy gain on a day
that the overall bond market was up only modestly. Some bonds don’t
trade all that often. Notice that some bonds were up and others were
down on this particular day. The demand of new buyers and the supply of
interested sellers influence the price movement of a given bond.
In addition to the direction of overall interest rates, changes in the financial
health of the company that stands behind the bond strongly affect the price
of an individual bond.
Buying Treasuries
If you want to purchase Treasury bonds, buying them through the Federal
Reserve is the lowest-cost method. The Federal Reserve doesn’t charge for
accounts with less than $100,000 and charges $25 annually for accounts with
more than $100,000 in Treasury bonds. Contact a Federal Reserve branch
near you (check the government section of your local phone directory) and
ask them to mail you information about how to purchase Treasury bonds
through the Treasury Direct program. Or you can call 800-722-2678 or visit
the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Web site (www.ustreas.gov).
You may also purchase and hold Treasury bonds through brokerage firms
and mutual funds. Brokers typically charge a flat fee for buying a Treasury
bond. Buying Treasuries through a brokerage account makes sense if you
hold other securities through the brokerage account and you like the ability
to quickly sell a Treasury bond that you hold.
Selling Treasury bonds held through the Federal Reserve isn’t easy or cost-
free. In the past, you had to transfer them to a broker. Now you can sell your
Treasury bonds through the Fed instead of transferring them out, which elimi-
nates that hassle. However, selling Treasury bonds through the Fed isn’t easy.
Here’s what you have to do. First, obtain and complete a form; get a signature
guarantee; and then mail the form to the Chicago Federal Reserve. The
Chicago Fed will get in touch with you and provide you with three bids from
dealers, and you can then select the best one. After the transaction (which
costs $45), is completed, you must wait a couple business days for the pro-
ceeds to be placed in your bank account.
156
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

The advantage of a mutual fund that invests in Treasuries is that it typically
holds Treasuries of differing maturities, thus offering diversity. You can gen-
erally buy and sell no-load (commission-free) Treasury bond mutual funds
easily and without fees. Funds, however, do charge an ongoing management
fee. The Vanguard Group of mutual funds offers Treasury mutual funds with
good track records and low management fees (see Chapter 8).
Buying other individual bonds
Purchasing other types of individual bonds, such as corporate and mortgage
bonds, is a much more treacherous and time-consuming undertaking than
buying Treasuries. Here’s my advice for doing it right and minimizing the
chance of a catastrophic mistake:
 Don’t buy through salespeople. Brokerage firms that employ represen-
tatives on commission are in the sales business. Many of the worst
bond-investing disasters have befallen customers of such brokerage
firms. Your best bet is to purchase individual bonds through discount
brokers (see Chapter 9).
 Don’t be suckered into high yields — buy quality. Yes, junk bonds pay
higher yields, but they also have a much higher chance of default.
Nothing personal, but you’re not going to do as good a job as a profes-
sional money manager at spotting problems and red flags with a bond’s
issuing company. Thus, you’re more likely to be left holding the bag
157
Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments
Assessing individual bonds that you already own
If you already own individual bonds, and they fit
your financial objectives and tax situation, you
can hold them until maturity because you’ve
already incurred a commission when they were
purchased; selling them now would just create
an additional fee. When the bonds mature, the
broker who sold them to you will probably be
more than happy to sell you some more. That’s
the time to check out good bond mutual funds
(see Chapter 8).
Don’t mistakenly think that your current individ-
ual bonds pay the yield that they had when they
were originally issued. (That yield is the number
listed in the name of the bond on your broker-
age account statement.) As the market level of
interest rates changes, the effective yield (the
interest payment divided by the bond’s price) on
your bonds fluctuates as well, to rise and fall
with the market level of rates. So if rates have
fallen since you bought your bonds, the value of
those bonds has increased — which in turn
reduces the effective yield that you earn.

when some of your junk-bond purchases end up in the junkyard. Stick
with highly rated bonds so that you don’t have to worry about and
suffer through these unfortunate consequences.
 Understand that bonds may be called. Many bonds, especially corpo-
rate bonds, can legally be called before maturity. This means that the
bond issuer pays you back early, because it doesn’t need to borrow as
much money or because interest rates have fallen and the borrower
wants to reissue new bonds at a lower interest rate. Be especially careful
about purchasing bonds that were issued at higher interest rates than
those that currently prevail. Borrowers pay off such bonds first.
 Diversify. Invest and hold bonds from a variety of companies in different
industries to buffer changes in the economy that adversely affect one
industry or a few industries more than others. Of the money that you
want to invest in bonds, don’t put more than 5 percent into any one
bond. That means that you need to hold at least 20 bonds. Diversification
requires a good chunk of change to invest given the size of most bonds
and because high fees erode your investment balance if you invest too
little.
 Shop around. Just like when you buy a car, you need to shop around for
good prices on the bonds that you have in mind. The hard part is doing
an apples-to-apples comparison because different brokers may not be
able to offer the same exact bond as other brokers. Remember that the
two biggest determinants of what a bond should yield are its maturity
date and its credit rating.
As with buying individual bonds (other than Treasuries), selling them is
much more treacherous and time consuming. Be sure to shop around, rather
than relying on the price offered by just one broker.
Unless you invest in boring, simple-to-understand bonds such as Treasuries,
you’re better off investing in bonds via the best bond mutual funds. One
exception is if you absolutely, positively must receive your principal back on
a certain date. Because bond funds don’t mature, individual bonds with the
correct maturity for you may best suit your needs. Consider Treasuries
because they carry such low default risk. Otherwise, you need a lot of time,
money, and patience to invest well in individual bonds.
Considering Other Lending Investments
Bonds, money market funds, and bank savings vehicles are hardly the only
lending investments that exist. A variety of other companies are more than
willing to have you lend them your money and pay you a relatively fixed rate
158
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

of interest. In most cases, you’re better off staying away from the following
investments.
Too many investors get sucked into lending investments that offer higher
yields. Always remember: Risk and return go hand in hand. Higher yields
mean greater risk, and vice versa.
Guaranteed-investment contracts
Insurance companies sell and back guaranteed-investment contracts (GICs).
The allure of GICs is that your account value doesn’t appear to fluctuate. Like
a one-year bank certificate of deposit, GICs generally quote you an interest
rate for the next year. Some GICs lock in the rate for longer periods of time,
whereas others may change the interest rate several times per year.
The insurance company that issues the GIC actually invests your money,
mostly in bonds and maybe a bit in stocks. Like other bonds and stocks,
these investments fluctuate in value — you just don’t see it.
Typically once a year, you receive a new statement that shows that your GIC
is worth more, thanks to the newly added interest. This statement makes 
otherwise-nervous investors who can’t stand volatile investments feel all
warm and fuzzy.
The yield on a GIC is usually comparable to those available on shorter-term,
high-quality bonds. Yet the insurer invests in longer-term bonds and some
stocks. The difference between what these investments generate for the
insurer and what the GIC pays you in interest goes to the insurer.
The insurer’s take can be significant and is generally hidden. Unlike a mutual
fund, which is required to report the management fee that it collects and sub-
tracts it before paying your return, GIC insurers have no such obligations. By
having a return guaranteed in advance, you pay heavily — an effective fee of
2-plus percent per year — for the peace of mind in the form of lower long-
term returns.
The high effective fees that you pay to have an insurer manage your money in
a GIC aren’t the only drawbacks. When you invest in a GIC, your assets are
part of the insurer’s general assets. Insurance companies sometimes fail, and
although they often merge with a healthy insurer, you can still lose money.
The rate of return on GICs from a failed insurance company is often slashed
to help restore financial soundness to the company. So the only “guarantee”
that comes with a GIC is that the insurer agrees to pay you the promised rate
of interest (as long as it is able)!
159
Chapter 7: Exploring Bonds and Other Lending Investments

Private mortgages
In the section “Mortgage bonds,” earlier in this chapter, I discuss investing in
mortgages that resemble the ones that you take out to purchase a home. To
directly invest in mortgages, you can loan your money to people who need
money to buy or refinance real estate. Such loans are known as mortgages or
second mortgages.
Private mortgage investments appeal to investors who don’t like the volatility
of the stock and bond markets and aren’t satisfied with the seemingly paltry
returns on bonds or other common lending investments. Private mortgages
seem to offer the best of both worlds — stock-market-like 10-plus percent
returns without volatility.
Mortgage and real estate brokers often arrange mortgage investments, so you
must tread carefully because these people have a vested interest in seeing
the deal done. Otherwise, the mortgage broker doesn’t get paid for closing
the loan, and the real estate broker doesn’t get a commission for selling a
property.
160
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Why companies offer GICs 
in their retirement plans
In their retirement plans, more than a few com-
panies offer guaranteed-investment contracts
(GICs) as an investment option. You may right-
fully ask why because, as I discuss in this chap-
ter, GICs are investments that leave much to be
desired. I see GICs most often in companies
where an insurer is already entrenched as the
provider of the company’s retirement plan
investment options. Insurers love GICs because
they’re so profitable — for them, that is.
But in some company retirement plans, GICs are
the one and only investment option that an
insurance company offers. Historically, compa-
nies were attracted to GICs as a defensive mea-
sure. GICs seemed so safe and conservative.
Therefore, GICs made company officials who
selected their retirement plan investment
options feel safe. (More than a few benefits
administrators and other corporate personnel
who establish and maintain these plans aren’t
exactly investing geniuses.)
Over the years, as more insurers have failed
(including ones that appeared to be financially
sound), the true risk of GICs has become more
apparent. Because more people and companies
have discovered attractive alternative invest-
ment options, such as mutual funds, that offer
higher returns and low expenses, the popularity
of GICs has waned. If your company’s retirement
plan doesn’t offer good investment choices and
has too many GIC-like investments, talk to your
benefits department. You can also anonymously
leave the employees there a copy of this book so
they can better educate themselves!

One broker who also happens to write about real estate wrote a newspaper
column describing mortgages as the “perfect real estate investment” and
added that mortgages are a “high-yield, low-risk investment.” If that wasn’t
enough to get you to whip out your checkbook, the writer/broker further
gushed that mortgages are great investments because you have “little or no
management, no physical labor.”
You know by now that a low-risk, high-yield investment doesn’t exist. Earning
a relatively high interest rate goes hand in hand with accepting relatively
high risk. The risk is that the borrower can default — which leaves you hold-
ing the bag. More specifically, you can get stuck with a property that you may
need to foreclose on, and if you don’t hold the first mortgage, you’re not first
in line with a claim on the property. 
The fact that private mortgages are high risk should be obvious when you
consider why the borrower elects to obtain needed funds privately rather
than through a bank. Put yourself in the borrower’s shoes. As a property
buyer or owner, if you can obtain a mortgage through a conventional lender,
such as a bank, wouldn’t you do so? After all, banks generally give better
interest rates. If a mortgage broker offers you a deal where you can, for exam-
ple, borrow money at 11 percent when the going bank rate is, say, 7 percent,
the deal must carry a fair amount of risk.
I would avoid these investments. If you really want to invest in such mort-
gages, you must do some time-consuming homework on the borrower’s finan-
cial situation. A banker doesn’t lend someone money without examining a
borrower’s assets, liabilities, and monthly expenses, and you shouldn’t
either. Be careful to check the borrower’s credit, and get a large down pay-
ment (at least 20 percent). The best circumstance in which to be a lender is if
you sell some of your own real estate and you’re willing to act as the bank
and provide the financing to the buyer in the form of a first mortgage.
Also recognize that your mortgage investment carries interest rate risk: If you
need to “sell” it early, you’d have to discount it, perhaps substantially if inter-
est rates have increased since you purchased it. Try not to lend so much
money on one mortgage that it represents more than 5 percent of your total
investments.
If you’re willing to lend your money to borrowers who carry a relatively high
risk of defaulting, consider investing in high-yield (junk) bond mutual funds
instead. With these funds, you can at least diversify your money across many
borrowers, and you benefit from the professional review and due diligence of
the fund management team. You can also consider lending money to family
members.

Out of sight: Fluctuations of

One of the allures of nonbond investments, such
as private mortgages, GICs, and CDs, is that they
don’t fluctuate in value — at least not that you
can see. Such investments appear safer and less
volatile. You can’t watch your principal fluctuate
in value because you can’t look up the value
daily, the way you can with bonds and stocks.
But the principal values of your mortgage, GIC,
and CD investments really do fluctuate; you just
don’t see the fluctuations! As I explain in the
section “Determining when you get your money
back: Maturity matters,” earlier in this chapter,
just as the market value of a bond drops when
interest rates rise, so does the market value of
these investments, and for the same reasons. At
higher interest rates, investors expect a dis-
counted price on your fixed-interest rate invest-
ment because they always have the alternative
of purchasing a new mortgage, GIC, or CD at the
higher prevailing rates. Some of these invest-
ments are actually bought and sold (and behave
just like bonds) among investors on what’s
known as a secondary market.
If the normal volatility of a bond’s principal value
makes you queasy, try not to follow your invest-
ments so closely!

A
mutual fund is simply a big pool of money from lots of investors (like
you and me) that a mutual fund manager uses to buy a bunch of stocks,
bonds, and/or other assets that meet the fund’s investment criteria. The better
funds enable you to easily and cost-effectively diversify your investments —
that is, invest in many different industries and companies. (In the earlier
chapters of this part of the book, I explain all about stocks, bonds, and other
common securities. If you understand these securities, you can understand
mutual funds.)
When you invest in a fund, you buy shares and become a shareholder of the
fund. Good mutual funds enable you to have some of the best money man-
agers in the country direct the investment of your money. Because efficient
funds take most of the hassle and cost out of figuring out which companies 
to invest in, they’re among the finest investment vehicles available today.
Different types of mutual funds can help you meet various financial goals —
that’s one reason why investors have more than $8 trillion invested in funds!
You can use money market funds for something most everybody needs — an
emergency savings stash of three to six months’ living expenses. Or perhaps
you’re thinking about saving for a home purchase, retirement, or future edu-
cational costs. If so, you can consider some stock and bond mutual funds.
Too many people plunge into mutual funds without looking at their overall
financial situation and, in their haste, often end up paying more taxes and
overlooking other valuable financial strategies. If you haven’t taken a compre-
hensive look at your personal finances, read Chapter 3 to begin this impor-
tant process. 

Discovering the Benefits 
of the Best Funds
The best mutual funds are superior investment vehicles for people of all eco-
nomic means and for accomplishing many financial objectives. The following
sections go over the main reasons for investing in mutual funds rather than
individual securities.
Professional management
The mutual fund investment company hires a portfolio manager and
researchers whose full-time jobs are to research and purchase suitable
investments for the fund. These people screen the universe of investments
for those that meet the fund’s stated objectives.
Typically, fund managers are graduates of the top business and finance
schools, where they learned portfolio management and securities valuation
and selection. Many have additional investing credentials, such as the
Chartered Financial Analyst’s (CFA) degree. In addition to their educational
training, the best fund managers typically possess ten or more years of expe-
rience in analyzing and selecting investments.
For most fund managers and researchers, finding the best investments is
more than a full-time job. Fund managers do tons of analysis that you proba-
bly lack the time or expertise to perform. For example, fund managers assess
company financial statements; interview a company’s managers to get a
sense of the company’s business strategies and vision; examine competitor
strategies; speak with company customers, suppliers, and industry consul-
tants; and attend trade shows and read industry periodicals.
In short, a mutual fund management team does more research, number
crunching, and due diligence than you could ever have the energy or exper-
tise to do in what little free time you have. Investing in mutual funds frees up
time for friendships, family relationships, and maybe even your sex life —
don’t miss the terrific time-saving benefits of fund investing!
Cost efficiency
Mutual funds are a cheaper, more communal way of getting your investment
work done. When you invest your money in an efficiently managed mutual
fund, it likely costs you less than trading individual securities on your own.
164
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

Fund managers can buy and sell securities for a fraction of the cost that 
you pay.
Funds also spread the cost of research over thousands of investors. The most
efficiently managed mutual funds cost less than 1 percent per year in fees.
(Bonds and money market funds cost much less — in the neighborhood of
0.5 percent per year or less.) Some of the larger and more established funds
can charge annual fees less than 0.2 percent per year — that’s less than $2
annual charge per $1,000 you invest. Such a deal!
Diversification
Diversification is a big attraction for many investors who choose mutual
funds. Most funds own stocks or bonds from dozens of companies, thus
diversifying against the risk of bad news from any single company or sector.
Achieving such diversification on your own is difficult and expensive unless
you have a few hundred thousand dollars and a great deal of time to invest.
Mutual funds typically invest in 25 to 100 securities or more. Proper diversifi-
cation increases the chances of the fund earning higher returns with less risk.
Although most mutual funds are diversified, some aren’t. For example, some
stock funds invest exclusively in stocks of a single industry (for example, health-
care) or country (such as Mexico). I’m not a fan of these funds because of the
narrowness of their investments and their typically higher operating fees.
Reasonable investment minimums
Most funds have low minimum investment requirements. Many funds have
minimums of $1,000 or less. Retirement account investors can often invest
with even less. Some funds even offer monthly investment plans, so you can
start with as little as $50 per month.
Even if you have lots of money to invest, you should consider mutual funds.
Increasing numbers of fund companies offer higher-balance customers spe-
cial funds with lower annual operating expenses and thus even better returns
(more on these funds later in this chapter).
Different funds for different folks
Some people think that mutual funds = stock market investing = risky. That’s
wrong. The majority of money in mutual funds isn’t in the stock market. You
165
Chapter 8: Selecting Mutual Funds: Stock, Bond, and Money Market Funds

may select the funds that take on the kinds of risks that you’re comfortable
with and that meet your financial goals. Following is a list of the three major
types of mutual funds:
 Stock funds: If you want your money to grow over a long period of time
(and you can handle down as well as up years), choose funds that invest
more heavily in stocks.
 Bond funds: If you need current income and don’t want investments
that fluctuate as widely in value as stocks do, consider some bond
funds.
 Money market funds: If you want to be sure that your invested principal
doesn’t decline in value because you may need to use your money in the
short term, select a money market fund.
Most investors (myself included) choose a combination of these three types
of funds to diversify and help accomplish different financial goals. (I cover
each type of fund in depth later in the chapter.)
High financial safety
Thousands of banks and insurance companies have failed in recent decades.
Banks and insurers can fail because their liabilities (the money that customers
give them to invest, which they can be called upon to return on short notice)
can exceed their assets (the money that they’ve invested or lent). For exam-
ple, when big chunks of a bank’s loans go sour at the same time that its
depositors want their money, the bank fails, because banks typically have
less than 15 cents on deposit for every dollar that you and I place with them.
Likewise, if an insurance company makes several poor investments or under-
estimates the number of insurance policyholder claims, it too can fail.
Such failures can’t happen with a mutual fund because the value of the fund’s
shares fluctuates as the securities in the fund fluctuate in value. For every
dollar of securities they hold for their customers, mutual funds have a
dollar’s worth of securities. The worst that can happen with a fund is that if
you want your money, you may get less cash than you originally put into the
fund — but you won’t lose all your investment.
For added security, the specific stocks, bonds, and other securities that a
mutual fund buys are held at a custodian, a separate organization independent
of the mutual fund company. A custodian ensures that the fund management
company can’t embezzle your funds or use assets from a better-performing
fund to subsidize a poor performer.

Accessibility
What’s really terrific about dealing with mutual funds is that they’re set up
for people who value their time and don’t like going to a local branch office
and standing in long lines. With funds, you can fill out a simple form (even
online, if you wish) and write a check in the comfort of your living room to
make your initial investment. You can then typically make subsequent invest-
ments by mailing in a check or authorizing money transfers from your other
accounts, such as bank savings or checking accounts.
Additionally, most money market funds offer check-writing privileges. Many
mutual fund companies also allow you to wire money back and forth from
your local bank account; you can access your money almost as quickly
through a money market fund as you can through your local bank.
Selling shares of your mutual fund is usually simple. Generally, all you need to
do is call the fund company’s toll-free number or visit its Web site. Some com-
panies have representatives available around the clock, year-round. Most
fund companies also offer online account access and trading capabilities as
well (although as I discuss in Chapter 19, some people are prone to overtrad-
ing online).
The Keys to Successful Fund Investing
This chapter helps explain why funds are a good investment vehicle to use but
not all funds are worthy of your investment dollars. Would you, for example,
167
Chapter 8: Selecting Mutual Funds: Stock, Bond, and Money Market Funds
Exchange traded funds
In recent years, exchange traded funds (ETFs)
have grown both in number and quality. ETFs
are similar to mutual funds, with the most sig-
nificant difference being that in order to invest,
you must buy into an ETF through a stock
exchange where ETFs trade, just as individual
stocks do.
ETFs are most like index mutual funds in that
each ETF generally tracks a major market index.
The best ETFs may also have slightly lower
operating expenses than the lowest-cost index
funds. However, you must pay a brokerage fee
to buy and sell an ETF, and the current market
value of the ETF may deviate slightly from the
underlying market value of the securities in its
portfolio.

native or complement to your mutual fund port-
folio, please see the latest edition of my book
Mutual Funds For Dummies (Wiley).

invest in a mutual fund run by an inexperienced and unproven 18-year-old?
How about a fund that charges high fees and produces inferior returns in
comparison to other similar funds? You don’t have to be an investing wizard
to know the correct answers. When you select a fund, you can use a number
of simple, common-sense criteria to greatly increase your chances of invest-
ment success.
Minimize costs
For a particular type of mutual fund (U.S. stock funds, for example), dozens
to sometimes hundreds of choices are available. The charges that you pay to
buy or sell a fund, as well as the ongoing fund operating expenses, can have a
big impact on the rate of return that you earn on your investments.
Fund costs are an important factor in the return that you earn from a mutual
fund because fees are deducted from your investment returns and can attack
a fund from many angles. All other things being equal, high fees and other
charges depress your returns.
Stick with funds that maintain low total operating expenses and that don’t
charge sales loads (commissions). Both types of fees come out of your pocket
and reduce your rate of return. Plenty of excellent funds are available at rea-
sonable annual operating expense ratios (less than 1.0 percent for stock
funds; less than 0.5 percent for bond funds). See my recommendations in the
respective sections on the best stock mutual funds, bond funds, and money
market funds, later in this chapter.
Avoid load funds
The first such fee that you need to minimize is the sales loads, which is a
commission paid to brokers and “financial planners” who work on commis-
sion and sell mutual funds. Commissions, or loads, generally range from 4.0 to
8.5 percent of the amount that you invest. Sales loads are an additional and
unnecessary cost that is deducted from your investment money. You can find
plenty of outstanding no-load (commission-free) funds.
Brokers, being brokers, sing the praises of buying a load fund, warn against
no-loads, and they even sometimes try to obscure the load. For example, bro-
kers may tell you that the commission doesn’t cost you because the mutual
fund company pays it. Remember that the commission always comes out of
your investment dollars, regardless of how cleverly some load funds and bro-
kers disguise the commission.
Brokers also may say that load funds perform better than no-load funds. One
reason, brokers claim, is that load funds supposedly hire better fund man-
agers. Absolutely no relationship exists between paying a sales charge to buy
168
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

a fund and gaining access to better investment managers. Remember that the
sales commission goes to the selling broker, not to the fund managers.
Objective studies demonstrate time and again that load funds not only don’t
outperform but, in fact, also underperform no-loads. Common sense suggests
why — when you factor in the higher commission and the higher average
ongoing operating expenses charged on load funds, you pay more to own a
load fund, so your returns are less.
Another problem with commission-driven load fund sellers is the power of self-
interest. This issue is rarely talked about, but it’s even more important than the
extra costs that you pay with load funds. When you buy a load fund through a
salesperson, you miss out on the chance to get holistic advice on other per-
sonal finance strategies. For example, you may be better off paying down your
debts or investing in something entirely different from a mutual fund. But in my
experience, salespeople almost never advise you to pay off your credit cards or
your mortgage — or to invest through your company’s retirement plan or in
real estate — instead of buying an investment through them.
Some mutual fund companies, such as Fidelity, try to play it both ways (because
they sell their funds through brokers as well as direct to consumers): They sell
load as well as no-load funds.
Beware of high operating expenses
In addition to loads, the other costs of owning funds are the ongoing operat-
ing expenses. All mutual funds charge fees as long as you keep your money in
the fund. The fees pay for the costs of running a fund, such as employees’
salaries, marketing, toll-free phone lines, printing and mailing prospectuses
(legal disclosure of the fund’s operations and fees), and so on.
169
Chapter 8: Selecting Mutual Funds: Stock, Bond, and Money Market Funds
Hiding loads
Unfortunately, fund companies have come up
with craftier ways of hiding sales loads.
Increasing numbers of brokers and “financial
planners” sell funds that they call no-loads, but
these funds aren’t no-loads.
In back-end or deferred sales load funds, the
commission is hidden, thanks to the different
classes of shares, known as A, B, C, and D
classes. Salespeople tell you that as long as you
stay in a fund for five to seven years, you need
not pay the back-end sales charge that applies
when you sell the investment. This claim may be
true, but it’s also true that these funds pay
investment salespeople a hefty commission.
The salespeople can receive their commissions
because the fund company charges you exorbi-
tant continuing operating expenses (which are
usually at least 1 percent more per year than the
best funds). So one way or another, they get
their commissions from your investment dollars.

A mutual fund’s operating expenses are essentially invisible to you because
they’re deducted from the fund’s share price. Companies charge operating
expenses on a daily basis, so you don’t need to worry about trying to get out of
a fund at a particular time of the year before the company deducts these fees.
Although expenses are invisible to you, their impact on your returns is quite
real. Expenses are critical on money market mutual funds and bond funds;
these funds buy securities that are so similar and so efficiently priced in the
financial markets that most fund managers in a given type of money market
or bond fund earn quite similar returns before expenses.
With stock funds, expenses may play less of an important role in your fund
decision. However, don’t forget that over time, stocks have averaged returns
of about 10 percent per year. So if one stock fund charges 1.5 percent more in
operating expenses than another, you give up an extra 15 percent of your
expected (pre-tax) annual returns (and an even greater portion of your after-
tax returns).
All types of funds with higher operating expenses tend to produce lower
rates of return on average. Conversely, funds with lower operating costs can
more easily produce higher returns for you than a comparable type of fund
with high costs. This effect makes sense because companies deduct operat-
ing expenses from the returns that your fund generates. Higher expenses
mean a lower return to you.
Fund companies quote a fund’s operating expenses as a percentage of your
investment. The percentage represents an annual fee or charge. You can find
this number in a fund’s prospectus, in the fund expenses section, usually in a
line that says something like “Total Fund Operating Expenses.” Or you can
call the mutual fund’s toll-free phone number and ask a representative, or try
to find the information at the fund company’s Web site. Make sure that a fund
doesn’t appear to have low expenses simply because it’s temporarily waiving
them. (You can ask the fund representative or look at the fees in it’s the
fund’s prospectus to find this information.)
Consider performance and risk
A fund’s historic rate of return or performance is another important factor to
weigh when you select a mutual fund. Keep in mind, however, as all mutual
fund materials must tell you, that past performance is no guarantee of future
results. In fact, many former high-return funds achieved their results only by
taking on high risk. Funds that assume higher risk should produce higher rates
of return. But high-risk funds usually decline in price faster during major
market declines. Thus, a good fund should consistently deliver a favorable
rate of return given the level of risk that it takes.
170
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

A big mistake that many investors make when they choose a mutual fund is
overemphasizing the importance of past performance numbers. The shorter
the time period, the greater the danger of misusing high performance as an
indicator for a good future fund.
Although past performance can be a good sign, high returns for a fund, rela-
tive to its peers, are largely possible only if a fund takes more risk. The
danger of taking more risk is that it doesn’t always work the way you’d like.
The odds are high that you won’t be able to pick the next star before it vaults
to prominence in the investing sky. You have a far greater chance of boarding
that star when it’s ready to plummet back to Earth.
In fact, if you had invested in the annual number one top-performing stock
and bond funds over the last 15 years, the majority (more than 70 percent) of
those top performers subsequently performed worse, over the next 3 to 10
years, than the average funds in their peer groups!
One clever way that mutual funds make themselves look better than other
comparable funds is to compare themselves to funds that aren’t really com-
parable. The most common ploy is for a fund to invest in riskier types of
securities and then compare its performance to funds that invest in less risky
securities. Examine the types of securities that a fund invests in, and make
sure that the comparison funds or indexes invest in similar securities.
Stick with experience
A great deal of emphasis is placed on who manages a specific mutual fund.
Although the individual fund manager is important, a manager isn’t an island
unto himself. The resources and capabilities of the parent company are
equally, if not more, important. Managers come and go, but fund compa-
nies don’t.
Different companies maintain different capabilities and levels of expertise
with different types of funds. Vanguard, for example, is terrific at money
market, bond, and conservative stock funds, thanks to its low operating
expenses. Fidelity has significant experience with investing in U.S. stocks.
A fund company gains more or less experience than others, not only from the
direct management of certain fund types, but also through hiring out. For
example, some fund families contract with private money management firms
that possess significant experience. In other cases, private money manage-
ment firms, such as PIMCO, Tweedy Browne, and Dodge & Cox, with long his-
tories in private money management, offer mutual funds.
171
Chapter 8: Selecting Mutual Funds: Stock, Bond, and Money Market Funds

Buy index funds
Unlike other mutual funds, in which the portfolio manager and a team of ana-
lysts scour the market for the best securities, an index fund manager simply
invests to match the performance of an index such as the Standard & Poor’s
500 index of 500 large U.S. company stocks. Index funds are funds that are
mostly managed by a computer.
Index funds deliver relatively good returns by keeping expenses low, staying
invested, and not trying to jump around. Over ten years or more, index funds
typically outperform about three-quarters of their peers! Most so-called
actively managed funds can’t overcome the handicap of high operating
expenses that pulls down their funds’ rates of return. Index funds can run
with far lower operating expenses because significant ongoing research need
not be conducted to identify companies to invest in.
The average U.S. stock mutual fund, for example, has an operating expense
ratio of 1.4 percent per year. (Some funds charge expenses as high as 2 per-
cent or more per year.) That being the case, a U.S. stock index fund with an
expense ratio of just 0.2 percent per year has an advantage of 1.2 percent per
year over the average fund. A 1.2 percent difference may not seem like much,
but in fact it is a significant difference. Because stocks tend to return about
10 percent per year, you end up throwing away about 12 percent of your
expected (pre-tax) stock fund returns with an “average fund” in terms of
expenses (and an even greater portion of your post-tax returns).
With actively managed stock funds, a fund manager can make costly mistakes,
such as not being invested when the market goes up, being too aggressive
when the market plummets, or just being in the wrong stocks. An actively
managed fund can easily underperform the overall market index that it’s
competing against.
Don’t overestimate your ability to pick in advance the few elite money man-
agers who manage to beat the market averages by a few percentage points
per year in the long run. Also, don’t overestimate the pros’ ability to consis-
tently pick the right stocks. Index funds make sense for a portion of your
investments, especially when you invest in bonds and larger, more conserva-
tive stocks, where beating the market is difficult for portfolio managers.
In addition to lower operating expenses, which help boost your returns,
index mutual funds are tax-friendlier to invest in when you invest outside
retirement accounts. Mutual fund managers of actively managed portfolios, 
in their attempts to increase returns, buy and sell securities more frequently.
However, this trading increases a fund’s taxable capital gains distributions
and reduces a fund’s after-tax return.
172
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

Vanguard is the largest and best mutual fund provider of index funds because
it maintains the lowest annual operating fees in the business. Vanguard has
all types of bond and stock (both U.S. and international) index mutual funds.
See my recommended-fund sections later in this chapter.
Creating Your Fund Portfolio
The specific amount that you decide to invest in any of the major types of
securities is known as asset allocation. Asset allocation simply means that
you decide what percentage of your investments you place — or allocate —
into bonds versus stocks and into international versus U.S. stocks. When 
you invest money for the longer term, such as for retirement, you can choose
among the various types of funds that I discuss in this chapter. Most people
get a big headache when they try to decide how to spread their money
across the choices. This section helps you begin cutting through the clutter.
(I discuss recommended funds for shorter-term goals later in this chapter 
as well.)
Allocating your assets for the long term:
Stock and bond funds
Many working folks have time on their side, and they need to use that time to
make their money grow. You may have two or more decades before you need
to draw on some portion of your retirement account assets. If some of your
investments drop a bit over a year or two — or even over five years — the
value of your investments has plenty of time to recover before you spend the
money in retirement.
Your current age and the number of years until you retire should be the
biggest factors in your allocation decision. The younger you are and the more
years you have before retirement, the more comfortable you should be with
growth-oriented (and more volatile) investments, such as stock funds. (See
Chapter 2 for the risks and historic returns of different investments.)
Table 8-1 lists guidelines for allocating mutual fund money that you’ve ear-
marked for long-term purposes, such as retirement. You don’t need an M.B.A.
or Ph.D. to decide your asset allocation — all you need to know is how old
you are and the level of risk that you desire!

What’s it all mean, you ask? Consider this example: If you’re a conservative
sort who doesn’t like a lot of risk, but you recognize the value of striving for
some growth to make your money work harder, you’re a middle-of-the-road
type. Using Table 8-1, if you’re 35 years old, you may consider putting 25 per-
cent (35 – 10) into bond funds and 75 percent (110 – 35) into stock funds.
Now divvy up your stock investment money between U.S. and international
funds. Here’s what portion of your “stock allocation” I recommend investing
in overseas stocks:
 20 percent (for play it safe)
 35 percent (for middle-of-the-road)
 50 percent (for aggressive)
If, for example, in Table 8-1, the 35-year-old, middle-of-the-road type invests
75 percent in stocks, she can then invest about 35 percent of the stock fund
investments (which works out to be around 25 percent of the total) in inter-
national stock funds.
So here’s what the 35-year-old, middle-of-the-road investor’s portfolio asset
allocation looks like so far:
Bonds
25%
U.S. stocks
50%
International stocks
25%
Diversifying your stock fund investments
Suppose that your investment allocation decisions suggest that you invest 
50 percent in U.S. stock funds. Which ones do you choose? As I explain in the
section “Exploring the different types of stock funds,” later in this chapter,
stock funds differ on a number of levels. There are growth-oriented stocks
and funds, and those that focus on value stocks. Small-, medium-, and large-
company stocks and funds also invest in such stocks. I explain these types of
174
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

stocks and funds later in the chapter. You also need to decide what portion
you want to invest in index funds (which I discuss in the “Buy index funds”
section, earlier in the chapter) versus actively managed funds that try to beat
the market.
Generally, it’s a good idea to diversify into different types of funds. You can
diversify in one of two ways:
 Purchase several individual funds, each of which focuses on a differ-
ent style. For example, you can invest in a large-company value stock
fund and in a small-company growth fund. I find this approach some-
what tedious. Granted, it does allow a fund manager to specialize and
gain greater knowledge about a particular type of stock. But many of the
best managers invest in more than one narrow range of security.
 Invest in a handful of funds (five to ten), each of which covers several
bases and that together cover them all. Remember, the investment
delineations are somewhat arbitrary, and most funds do more than just
one type of investment. For example, a fund may focus on small-company
value stocks but also invest in medium-company stocks, as well as in
some that are more growth oriented.
As for how much you should use index versus actively managed funds, it’s
really a matter of personal taste. If you’re happy knowing that you’ll get the
market rate of return and that you can’t underperform the market, index your
entire portfolio. On the other hand, if you enjoy the challenge of trying to pick
the better managers and want the potential to earn better than the market
level of returns, don’t use index funds at all. A happy medium is to do both.
(You may be interested in knowing that John Bogle, founder of Vanguard and
pioneer of index investment funds, has about half of his money invested in
index funds.)
If you haven’t experienced the sometimes significant plummets in stock
prices that occur, you may feel queasy when it next happens and you’ve got a
chunk of your nest egg in stocks. Be sure to read Chapters 2 and 5 to under-
stand the risk in stocks and what you can and can’t do to reduce the volatility
of your stock holdings.
The Best Stock Mutual Funds
Earlier in this book, I make the case for investing in stocks (also known as
equities) to make your money grow. However, stocks sometimes plummet 
or otherwise remain depressed for a few years. Thus, stock mutual funds
(also known as equity funds), which as their name suggests invest in stocks,
aren’t a place for money that you know you may need to protect in the next
few years.
175
Chapter 8: Selecting Mutual Funds: Stock, Bond, and Money Market Funds

Stock funds are excellent investment vehicles that reduce your risk, when
compared to purchasing individual stocks, because they:
 Invest in dozens of stocks: Unless you possess a lot of money to invest,
you’re likely to buy only a handful of stocks. If you end up with a lemon
in your portfolio, it can devastate your other good choices. If such a
stock represents 20 percent of your holdings, the rest of your stock
selections need to increase about 25 percent in value just to get you
back to even. Stock funds mitigate this risk. For example, if a fund holds
equal amounts of 50 stocks, and one goes to zero, you lose only 2 per-
cent of the fund value if the stock was an average holding. Similarly, if
the fund holds 100 stocks, you lose just 1 percent. Remember that a
good fund manager is more likely than you to sidestep disasters.
 Invest in different types of stocks: Some funds invest in stocks of differ-
ent size companies in a variety of industries. Others may hold U.S. and
international stocks. Different types of stocks (which are explained in
the upcoming section titled “Exploring the different types of stock
funds”) don’t move in tandem. So if smaller-company stocks get beat up,
larger-company stocks may fare better. If U.S. stocks are in the tank,
international stocks may be faring better. 
Making money with stock funds
When you invest in stock mutual funds, you can make money in three ways: 
 Dividends: As a mutual fund investor, you can choose to receive your
share of the dividends paid out to the fund as cash or reinvest them in
purchasing more shares in the fund. Higher-growth companies tend to
pay lower dividends.
Unless you need the income to live on (if, for example, you’re already
retired), reinvest your dividends into buying more shares in the fund. If
you do this outside of a retirement account, keep a record of those rein-
vestments because you need to factor those additional purchases into
the tax calculations that you make when you sell your shares.
 Capital gains distributions: When a fund manager sells stocks for more
than he paid, the resulting profits, known as capital gains, must be netted
against losses and paid out to the fund’s shareholders. Just as with divi-
dends, you can reinvest your capital gains distributions in the fund.
 Appreciation: The fund manager isn’t going to sell all the stocks that
have gone up in value. Thus, the price per share of the fund increases to
reflect the gains in its stock holdings. For you, these profits are on paper
until you sell the fund and lock them in. Of course, if a fund’s stocks
decline in value, the share price depreciates.
176
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

If you add together dividends, capital gains distributions, and appreciation,
you arrive at the total return of a fund. Stocks, and the funds that invest in
them, differ in the dimensions of these three possible returns, particularly
with respect to dividends, as I explain in Chapter 5.
Exploring the different 
types of stock funds
Stock funds and the stocks that they invest in are usually pigeonholed into
particular categories, based on the types of stocks that they focus on.
Categorizing stock funds is often tidier in theory than in practice, though,
because some funds invest in an eclectic mix of stocks. Don’t get bogged
down with the names of funds — funds sometimes have misleading names
and don’t necessarily do what their names imply. The investment strategies
of the fund and the fund’s typical investments are what matter. The following
characteristics are what you need to pay attention to:
 Company size: The first dimension on which a stock fund’s stock selec-
tion differs is based on the size of the company — small, medium, and
large companies — in which the fund invests. The total market value
(capitalization) of a company’s outstanding stock defines the categories
that define the stocks that the fund invests in. (The term capitalization is
often shortened to cap, so you may hear financial-folks tossing around
terms like large cap and small cap.) These dollar amounts are arbitrary,
and as stock prices increase over time, investment market analysts have
moved up their cutoffs:
• Small-company stocks, for example, are usually defined as stocks
of companies that possess total market capitalization of less than
$2 billion.
• Medium-capitalization stocks have market values between $2 bil-
lion and $10 billion.
• Large-capitalization stocks are those of companies with market
values greater than $10 billion.
Why care what about the size of the companies that a fund holds?
Historically, smaller companies pay lower dividends but appreciate
more. They have more-volatile share prices but tend to produce slightly
higher total returns. Larger companies’ stocks tend to pay greater divi-
dends and on average are less volatile and produce slightly lower total
returns than small-company stocks. Medium-size companies’ stocks, as
you may suspect, fall between the two.
177
Chapter 8: Selecting Mutual Funds: Stock, Bond, and Money Market Funds

 Growth versus value: Stock fund managers and their funds are further
categorized by whether they invest in growth or value stocks.
• Growth stocks have high prices in relation to the company’s assets,
profits, and potential profits. Growth companies typically experi-
ence rapidly expanding revenues and profits. These companies
tend to reinvest most of their earnings in the company to fuel future
expansion; thus, these stocks pay low dividends. For example, eBay
pays no dividends and reinvests most of its profits in its business.
• Value stocks are priced cheaply in relation to the company’s assets,
profits, and potential profits. Value stocks tend to pay higher divi-
dends than growth stocks and historically have actually produced
higher total returns than growth stocks.
Mutual fund companies sometimes use other terms to describe other
types of stock funds. Aggressive growth funds tend to invest in the most
growth-oriented companies and may undertake riskier investment prac-
tices, such as frequent trading. Growth and income funds tend to invest in
stocks that pay decent dividends, thus offering the investor the potential
for growth and income. Income funds tend to invest more in higher-yield-
ing stocks. Bonds usually make up the other portion of income funds.
 Company location: Stocks and the companies that issue them are also
divvied up based upon the location of their main operations and head-
quarters. Funds that specialize in U.S. stocks are, not surprisingly, called
U.S. stock funds; those focusing overseas are typically called interna-
tional or overseas funds.
Putting together two or three of these major classifications, you can start to
comprehend all those silly and lengthy names that mutual funds give their
stock funds. You can have funds that focus on large-company value stocks or
small-company growth stocks. You can add in U.S., international, and world-
wide finds to further subdivide these categories into more fund types. So you
can have international stock funds that focus on small-company stocks or
growth stocks.
You can purchase several stock funds, each focusing on a different type of
stock, to diversify into different types of stocks. Two potential advantages
result from doing so. First, not all your money rides in one stock fund and
with one fund manager. Second, each of the different fund managers can look
at and track particular stock investment possibilities.
Using the selection criteria I outline in the section “The Keys to Successful
Fund Investing,” earlier in this chapter, the following sections describe the
best stock funds that are worthy of your consideration. The funds differ pri-
marily in terms of the types of stocks that they invest in. Keep in mind as you
read through these funds that they also differ in their tax-friendliness (see
Chapter 3). If you invest inside a retirement account, you don’t need to worry
about tax-friendliness.
178
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

U.S. stock funds
Of all the different types of funds offered, U.S. stock funds are the largest cat-
egory. To see the forest amidst the trees, refer to the classifications that I
cover earlier in this section. Stock funds differ mainly in terms of the size of
the companies that they invest in and in whether the funds focus on growth
or value companies. Some funds do all these things, and some funds may
even invest a bit overseas.
The only way to know for sure where a fund currently invests (or where the
fund may invest in the future) is to ask. You can call the mutual fund company
that you’re interested in to start your information search or visit its Web site.
You can also read the fund’s annual report. Don’t waste your time looking for
this information in the fund’s prospectus because it doesn’t give you anything
beyond general parameters that guide the range of investments. The prospec-
tus doesn’t tell you what the fund currently invests in or has invested in.
For mutual funds that you hold outside of retirement accounts, you owe cur-
rent income tax on distributed dividends and capital gains. As I discuss in
Chapter 3, long-term capital gains and stock dividends are taxed at lower
rates than ordinary income and other investment income.
Here’s my short list of U.S. stock funds:
 American Century Income & Growth
 Dodge & Cox Stock
 Fidelity Disciplined Equity, Equity-Income, and Fidelity Low Priced Stock
 Masters’ Select Equity, Smaller Companies, and Value
 Neuberger & Berman Focus
 T. Rowe Price Spectrum Growth (holds some foreign stocks)
 Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, Primecap, Tax-Managed Capital
Appreciation, and Tax-Managed Small Capitalization
International stock funds
For diversification and growth potential, you should include stock funds that
invest overseas as part of your portfolio. Normally, you can tell that you’re
looking at a fund that focuses its investments overseas if its name contains
words such as international (foreign only), global (foreign and U.S.), or world-
wide (foreign and U.S.).
As a general rule, avoid foreign funds that invest in just one country, regard-
less of whether that country is Australia, Zimbabwe, or anywhere in between.
As with investing in a sector fund that specializes in a particular industry
(see the following section), this lack of diversification defeats the whole 
purpose of investing in funds. Funds that focus on specific regions, such as
179
Chapter 8: Selecting Mutual Funds: Stock, Bond, and Money Market Funds

Southeast Asia, are better but still generally problematic because of poor
diversification and higher expenses than other, more-diversified international
funds.
If you want to invest in more geographically limiting international funds, take
a look at T. Rowe Price’s and Vanguard’s offerings, which invest in broader
regions, such as investing just in Europe, Asia, and the volatile but higher-
growth-potential emerging markets in Southeast Asia and Latin America.
In addition to the risks normally inherent with stock fund investing, changes
in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar cause price
changes in the international securities. A decline in the value of the U.S. dollar
helps the value of foreign stock funds. Some foreign stock funds hedge against
currency changes. Although this hedging helps reduce volatility a bit, it does
cost money.
Here are my picks for diversified international funds:
 Artisan International
 Fidelity Diversified International
 Harbor International
 Masters’ Select International Equity
 Oakmark International and Global (holds some U.S. stocks)
 TIAA-CREF International Equity
 Tweedy Browne Global Value (invests in the U.S. as well)
 Vanguard International Growth, Tax-Managed International, and Total
International Stock Index
Sector funds
Sector funds invest in securities in specific industries. In most cases, you
should avoid sector funds for a number of reasons, including the following:
 Lack of diversification: Investing in stocks of a single industry defeats a
major purpose of investing in mutual funds — you give up the benefits of
diversification. Also, even if you’re lucky enough to jump into a sector
fund just before it becomes “hot,” you can’t assume that the fund will
pick the right securities within that sector.
 High fees: They tend to carry much higher fees than other mutual funds.
 Taxable distributions: Many sector funds have high rates of trading or
turnover of their investment holdings. Investors who use these funds
outside of retirement accounts have to face the IRS for the likely greater
taxable distributions that this trading produces.
180
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

The only types of specialty funds that may make sense for a small portion 
(10 percent or less) of your entire investment portfolio are funds that invest in
real estate or precious metals. These funds can help diversify your portfolio
because they can perform better during times of higher inflation — which often
depresses bond and stock prices. (However, you can comfortably skip these
funds because diversified stock funds tend to hold some of the same stocks as
these specialty funds.) Here are some details about these two specialty funds:
 Real estate funds: Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are stocks of
companies that invest in real estate. REITs typically invest in properties
such as apartment buildings, shopping centers, and other rental proper-
ties. REITs allow you to invest in real estate without the hassle of being a
landlord. Just as it’s a hassle to evaluate REIT stocks, you can always
invest in a mutual fund of REITs.
REITs usually pay decent dividends, which, unlike stock dividends, are
taxed at ordinary income tax rates. As such, they’re not appropriate for
people in a higher tax bracket who invest money outside of retirement
accounts. Some good no-load REIT funds include Fidelity Real Estate,
Vanguard REIT Index, and Cohen & Steers Realty Shares. (You can pur-
chase the latter fund with a lower minimum initial investment through
discount brokers.)
 Precious metals: If you expect high inflation, consider a gold fund. But
know that these funds swing wildly in value and aren’t for the faint of
heart; over the long term, such funds provide lousy returns — on about
par with increases in the cost of living. A good precious-metals fund is
the Vanguard Precious Metals Fund.
Don’t buy bullion itself; storage costs and the concerns over whether
you’re dealing with a reputable company make buying gold bars a pain.
Also avoid futures and options, which are gambles on short-term price
movements.
The Best Bond Funds
Bond funds can make you money in the same three ways that a stock fund
can — dividends, capital gains distributions, and appreciation. However, most
of the time, the bulk of your return in a bond fund comes from dividends.
Although an overwhelming number of bond fund choices exists (thousands,
in fact), not that many remain after you eliminate high-cost funds (those with
loads and high ongoing fees), low-performance funds (which are often the
high-cost funds), and funds managed by fund companies and fund managers
with minimal experience investing in bonds. Here are the aspects to consider
when choosing bond funds:
181
Chapter 8: Selecting Mutual Funds: Stock, Bond, and Money Market Funds

 Length to maturity: Bond fund objectives and names usually fit one of
three maturity categories — short-, intermediate-, and long-term. You can
earn a higher yield from investing in a bond fund that holds longer-term
bonds, but as I explain in Chapter 7, the associated risk that interest rates
will fall is also greater with longer-term bonds and funds that hold them.
 Quality: Generally speaking, the lower their issuer’s credit rating, the
riskier the bond. As with the risk associated with longer maturities, a
fund that holds lower-quality bonds should provide higher returns for
the increased risk you take. A higher yield is the bond market’s way of
compensating you for taking greater risk. Funds holding higher-quality
bonds provide lower returns but more security.
 Loads and fees: After you settle on the type of bonds that you want, a
bond fund’s costs — its sales commissions and annual operating fees —
are a huge consideration. Stick with no-load funds that maintain lower
annual operating expenses.
 Tax implications: Pay attention to the taxability of the dividends that
bonds pay. If you’re investing in bonds inside of retirement accounts,
you want taxable bonds. If you invest in bonds outside of retirement
accounts, the choice between taxable versus tax-free depends on your
tax bracket (see Chapter 3).
Invest in bond funds only if you have sufficient money in an emergency
reserve. If you invest money for longer-term purposes, particularly retirement,
you need to come up with an overall plan for allocating your money among a
variety of different funds, including bond funds. (See my asset allocation dis-
cussion in the section “Creating Your Fund Portfolio,” earlier in this chapter.)
Avoiding yield-related missteps
When selecting bond funds to invest in, investors are often led astray as to
how much they can expect to make. The first mistake is to look at recent per-
formance and assume that you’ll get that return in the future. Investing in
bond funds based on recent performance is tempting right after a period
where interest rates have declined (1990s and early 2000s), because declines
in interest rates pump up bond prices and, therefore, bond fund total returns.
Remember that an equal but opposite force waits to counteract pumped-up
bond returns — bond prices fall when interest rates rise.
Don’t get me wrong: Past performance is an important issue to consider. In
order for performance numbers to be meaningful and useful, you must com-
pare bond funds that are comparable (such as intermediate-term funds that
invest exclusively in high-grade corporate bonds).
Bond mutual funds calculate their yield after subtracting their operating
expenses. When you contact a mutual fund company seeking a fund’s current
yield, make sure that you understand what time period the yield covers. Fund
182
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

companies are supposed to give you the SEC yield, which is a standard yield
calculation that allows for fairer comparisons among bond funds. The SEC
yield reflects the bond fund’s so-called yield to maturity. The SEC yield is the
best yield to utilize when you compare funds because it captures the effec-
tive rate of interest that an investor can receive in the future.
Unfortunately, if you select bond funds based on advertised yield, you’re
almost guaranteed to purchase the wrong bond funds. Bond funds and the
mutual fund companies that sell them can play more than a few games to
fatten a fund’s yield. Such sleights of hand make a fund’s marketing and adver-
tising departments happy because higher yields make it easier for salespeople
and funds to hawk their bond funds. But remember that yield-enhancing
shenanigans can leave you poorer. Here’s what you need to watch out for:
 Lower quality: In comparing one short-term bond fund to another, you
may discover that one pays 0.5 percent more and decide that it looks
better. However, it turns out that the higher-yielding fund invests 20 per-
cent of its money in junk bonds, whereas the other fund fully invests in
high-quality bonds.
 Longer maturities: Bond funds can usually increase their yield just by
increasing their maturity a bit. If one long-term bond fund invests in
bonds that mature in an average of 17 years, and another fund possesses
an average maturity of 12 years, comparing the two is a classic case of
comparing apples and oranges.
 Giving your money back without your knowing it: Some funds return a
portion of your principal in the form of dividends. This move artificially
pumps up a fund’s yield but depresses its total return. When you com-
pare bond funds, make sure that you compare their total return over
time (in addition to making sure that the funds have comparable port-
folios of bonds).
 Waiving of expenses: Some bond funds, particularly newer ones, waive
a portion or even all their operating expenses to temporarily inflate the
fund’s yield. Yes, you can invest in a fund that has a sale on its operating
fees, but you’d also buy yourself the bother of monitoring things to
determine when the sale is over. Bond funds that engage in this practice
often end sales quietly when the bond market is performing well. Don’t
forget that if you sell a bond fund (held outside of a retirement account)
that has appreciated in value, you owe taxes on your profits.
Treading carefully with actively 
managed bond funds
Some bond funds are aggressively managed funds. Managers of these funds
possess a fair degree of latitude to purchase and trade bonds that they think
will perform best in the future. For example, if a fund manager thinks that
183
Chapter 8: Selecting Mutual Funds: Stock, Bond, and Money Market Funds

interest rates will rise, she usually buys shorter-term bonds and keeps more
of a fund’s assets in cash. The fund manager may invest more in lower-credit-
quality bonds if she thinks that the economy is improving and that more
companies will prosper and improve their credit standing.
Aggressively managed funds are a gamble. If interest rates fall instead of rise,
the fund manager who moved into shorter-term bonds and cash suffers
worse performance. If interest rates fall because the economy sinks into
recession, the lower-credit-quality bonds will likely suffer from a higher
default rate and depress the fund’s performance even further.
Some people think that it’s not difficult for the “experts” to predict which way
interest rates or the economy is heading. The truth is that economic predic-
tions are always difficult, and the experts are often wrong. Few bond fund
managers have been able to beat a buy-and-hold approach. However, William
Gross, who manages the PIMCO and Harbor bond funds, is one fund manager
who has pretty consistently beaten the market averages.
But remember that trying to beat the market can lead to getting beaten!
Increasing numbers of examples have occurred in recent years of bond funds
falling on their faces after risky investing strategies backfire. Interestingly,
bond funds that charge sales commissions (loads) and higher ongoing oper-
ating fees are the ones that are more likely to blow up, perhaps because these
fund managers are under more pressure to pump up returns to make up for
higher operating fees.
It’s fine to invest some of your bond fund money in funds that try to hold the
best position for changes in the economy and interest rates, but remember
that if these fund managers are wrong, you can lose more money. Over the long
term, you’ll probably do best with efficiently managed funds that stick with an
investment objective and that don’t try to time and predict the bond market.
Index funds that invest in a relatively fixed basket of bonds so as to track a
market index of bond prices are a good example of this passive approach.
Short-term bond funds
Of all bond funds, short-term bond funds are the least sensitive to interest
rate fluctuations. The stability of short-term bond funds makes them appro-
priate investments for money that you seek a better rate of return on than a
money market fund can produce for you. But with short-term bond funds,
you also have to tolerate the risk of losing a percent or two in principal value
if interest rates rise.
Short-term bonds work well for money that you earmark for use in a few years,
such as the purchase of a home or a car, or for money that you plan to with-
draw from your retirement account in the near future.
184
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

Taxable, short-term bond funds
Consider bond funds that pay taxable dividends when you’re not in a high tax
bracket and for investing inside of retirement accounts. My favorite is the
Vanguard Short-Term Investment Grade Portfolio.
Important note: Many of the Vanguard funds recommended in this chapter
offer “Admiral” versions that have even lower operating fees for customers
investing at least $100,000 (or $50,000, if the account has been in existence
for at least 10 years). 
U.S. Treasury short-term bond funds
U.S. Treasury bond funds may be appropriate if you prefer a bond fund that
invests in U.S. Treasuries (which possess the safety of government backing) or
if you’re not in a high federal tax bracket but you are in a high state tax bracket
(5 percent or higher). Vanguard Short-Term Treasury is a good choice.
I don’t recommend Treasuries for retirement accounts because they pay less
interest than fully taxable bond funds
Federally tax-free short-term bond funds
State and federally tax-free short-term bond funds are scarce. If you want
shorter-term bonds, and if you’re in a high federal bracket but in a low state
bracket (less than 5 percent), consider investing in these federally tax-free
bond funds (whose dividends are state taxable): 
 Vanguard Short-Term Tax-Exempt
 Vanguard Limited-Term Tax-Exempt
If you live in a state with high taxes, also consider checking out the state- and
federal-tax-free intermediate-term bond funds (which I discuss in the next
section) — if you can withstand their volatility. Another option is to use a
state money market fund, covered later in this chapter in “The Best Money
Market Funds.”
Intermediate-term bond funds
Intermediate-term bond funds hold bonds that typically mature in a decade
or so. They’re more volatile than shorter-term bonds but can also prove more
rewarding. The longer you own an intermediate-term bond fund, the more
likely you are to earn a higher return on it than on a short-term fund unless
interest rates continue to rise over many years.
As an absolute minimum, don’t purchase an intermediate-term fund unless you
expect to hold it for three to five years — or even longer, if you can. Therefore,
185
Chapter 8: Selecting Mutual Funds: Stock, Bond, and Money Market Funds

you need to make sure that the money that you put into an immediate-term
fund is money that you don’t expect to use in the near future.
Taxable intermediate-term bond funds
Taxable intermediate-term bond funds to consider include the following:
 Dodge & Cox Income
 Harbor Bond
 USAA GNMA
 Vanguard GNMA, High Yield Corporate, and Total Bond Market Index
U.S. Treasury intermediate-term bond funds
Consider U.S. Treasury bond funds if you prefer a bond fund that invests in
U.S. Treasuries (which maintain the safety of government backing) or if
you’re not in a high federal tax bracket but you are in a high state tax bracket
(5 percent or higher). I don’t recommend Treasuries for retirement accounts
because they pay less interest than fully taxable bond funds.
A couple of my favorites are Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities and
Vanguard Intermediate-Term Treasury.
Federally tax-free intermediate-term bond funds
You should consider federally tax-free bond funds if you’re in a high federal
bracket but a relatively low state bracket (less than 5 percent).
A few good ones include the following:
 Fidelity Spartan Intermediate Term Municipal Income
 USAA Tax-Exempt Intermediate-Term
 Vanguard Intermediate-Term Tax-Exempt
If you’re in a high federal and state tax bracket, refer to the state and feder-
ally tax-free bonds that I mention later in this section.
Long-term bond funds
Long-term bond funds are the most aggressive and volatile bond funds
around. If interest rates on long-term bonds increase substantially, you can
easily see the principal value of your investment decline 10 percent or more.
(See the discussion in Chapter 7 of how interest rate changes impact bond
prices.)
186
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

Long-term bond funds are generally used for retirement investing in one of
two situations:
 Investors don’t expect to tap their investment money for a decade or more.
 Investors want to maximize current dividend income and are willing to
tolerate volatility.
Don’t use these funds to invest money that you plan to use within the next
five years, because a bond market drop can leave your portfolio short of your
monetary goal.
Taxable long-term bond funds
I have just one favorite taxable bond fund that holds longer-term bonds. Can
you guess which fund company offers it? If you guessed Vanguard, you’re 
correct — the Vanguard Long-Term Investment Grade bond fund.
U.S. Treasury long-term bond funds
U.S. Treasury bond funds may be advantageous if you desire a bond fund that
invests in U.S. Treasuries or if you’re not in a high federal tax bracket but you
are in a high state tax bracket (5 percent or higher). I recommend Treasuries
for non-retirement accounts only because Treasuries pay less interest than
fully taxable bond funds.
I recommend the Vanguard Long-Term Treasury fund.
Federally tax-free long-term bond funds
Municipal (federally tax-free) long-term bond funds that I recommend include
Vanguard Long-Term Tax-Exempt and Vanguard Insured Long-Term Tax-Exempt.
State and federally tax-free long-term bond funds
State and federally tax-free bond funds may be appropriate when you’re in
high federal and high state (5 percent or higher) tax brackets. (If a fund isn’t
listed for your state, or if you’re only in a high federal tax bracket, you can
use the nationwide Vanguard Municipal bond funds.)
State and federally tax-free long-term bond funds to consider include the 
following:
 Fidelity Spartan CA Muni Income
 Vanguard CA Long-Term Tax-Exempt (Vanguard also offers a CA 
intermediate-term fund)
 Fidelity Spartan CT Muni Income
187
Chapter 8: Selecting Mutual Funds: Stock, Bond, and Money Market Funds

 Fidelity Spartan FL Muni Income
 Vanguard FL Long-Term Tax-Exempt
 Fidelity Spartan MA Muni Income
 Vanguard MA Tax-Exempt
 T. Rowe Price MD Tax-Free
 Fidelity Spartan MI Muni Income
 Fidelity Spartan MN Muni Income
 Vanguard NJ Long-Term Tax-Exempt
 Vanguard NY Long-Term Tax-Exempt
 Vanguard OH Long-Term Tax-Exempt
 Vanguard PA Long-Term Tax-Exempt
The Best Hybrid Funds
Hybrid funds invest in a mixture of different types of securities. Most com-
monly, they invest in both bonds and stocks. These funds are usually less
risky and less volatile than funds that invest exclusively in stocks; in an eco-
nomic downturn, bonds usually hold value better than stocks.
Hybrid funds make it easier for investors who are skittish about investing in
stocks to hold stocks because they reduce the volatility that normally comes
with pure stock funds. Because of their extensive diversification, hybrid
funds are excellent choices for an investor who doesn’t have much money to
start with.
Hybrid funds come in two forms:
 Balanced funds generally try to maintain a fairly constant percentage of
investment in stocks and bonds.
 Asset allocation funds, by contrast, normally adjust the mix of different
investments according to the portfolio manager’s expectations. Some
asset allocation funds, however, tend to keep more of a fixed mix of stocks
and bonds, whereas some balanced funds shift the mix around quite fre-
quently. (Although the concept of a manager being in the right place at the
right time and beating the market averages sounds good in theory, most
funds that shift assets fail to outperform a buy-and-hold approach.)
Because hybrid funds pay decent dividends from the bonds that they hold,
they’re not appropriate for some investors who purchase funds outside tax-
sheltered retirement accounts. If you’re in a higher tax bracket, you should
consider tax-free bonds (see Chapter 7). With the exception of the Vanguard
Tax-Managed Balanced Fund, which holds federally tax-free bonds, avoid
188
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

hybrid funds if you’re in a higher tax bracket. You should consider buying
separate tax-friendly stock funds and tax-free bond funds (both discussed
later in the chapter) to create your own hybrid portfolio.
Here’s my recommended short list of great balanced-type mutual funds:
 Dodge & Cox Balanced
 Fidelity Asset Manager, Freedom Funds, and Fidelity Puritan
 TIAA-CREF Managed Allocation
 T. Rowe Price Balanced
 Vanguard LifeStrategy Funds, Wellesley Income, and Wellington
The Best Money Market Funds
As I explain in Chapter 7, money market funds are a safe, higher-yielding
alternative to bank accounts. (If you’re in a higher tax bracket, money market
funds have even more appeal because you can get tax-free versions of money
market funds.) Under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations,
money market funds can invest only in the highest-credit-rated securities,
and their investments must have an average maturity of less than 90 days.
The short-term nature of these securities effectively eliminates the risk of
money market funds being sensitive to changes in interest rates.
The securities that money market funds use are extremely safe. General-
purpose money market funds invest in government-backed securities, bank
certificates of deposit, and short-term corporate debt that the largest and
most creditworthy companies and the U.S. government issue.
When shopping for a money fund, consider these factors:
 Expenses: Within a given category of money market funds (general,
Treasury, municipal, and so on), money market fund managers invest in
the same basic securities. The market for these securities is pretty darn
efficient, so “superstar” money market fund managers may eke out an
extra 0.1 percent per year in yield, but not much more.
Select a money market fund that does a good job controlling its expenses.
The operating expenses that the fund deducts before payment of divi-
dends are the biggest determinant of yield. All other things being equal
(which they usually are with different money market funds), lower oper-
ating expenses translate into higher yields for you.
You have no need or reason to tolerate annual operating expenses of
greater than 0.5 percent. Some top-quality funds charge a third of 1 per-
cent or less annually. Remember, lower expenses don’t mean that a fund
company cuts corners or provides poor service. Lower expenses are
189
Chapter 8: Selecting Mutual Funds: Stock, Bond, and Money Market Funds

possible in most cases because a fund company is successful in attract-
ing a lot of money to invest.
 Tax consequences: With money market funds, all your return comes
from dividends. What you actually get to keep of these returns (on non-
retirement account investments) is what is left over after the federal and
state governments take their cut of your investment income. If you invest
money that’s held outside of a retirement account, and you’re in a high
tax bracket, you may come out ahead if you invest in tax-free money
market funds. If you’re in a high-tax state, a state money market fund, if
good ones exist for your state, may be a sound move.
Tax-free refers to the taxability of the dividends that the fund pays. You
don’t get a tax deduction for money that you put into the fund, as you do
with 401(k) or other retirement-type accounts.
 Location of other funds: Consider what other investing you plan to do
at the fund company where you establish a money market fund. Suppose
that you decide to make mutual fund investments in stocks and bonds at
T. Rowe Price. Then keeping a money market fund at a different firm that
offers a slightly higher yield may not be worth the time and administra-
tive hassle, especially if you don’t plan on keeping much cash in your
money market fund.
 Associated services: Good money market funds offer other useful ser-
vices, such as free check writing, telephone exchange and redemptions,
and automated electronic exchange services with your bank account.
Most mutual fund companies don’t have many local branch offices. Generally,
this fact helps fund companies keep their expenses low so they can pay you
greater money market fund yields. You may open and maintain your mutual
fund account via the fund’s toll-free phone lines, the mail, or the company’s
Web site. You don’t really get much benefit, except psychological, if you
select a fund company with an office in your area. But I don’t want to dimin-
ish the importance of your emotional comfort level.
Using the criteria that I just discussed, I recommend in this section the best
money market funds — those that offer competitive yields, check writing,
access to other excellent mutual funds, and other commonly needed money
market services.
Taxable money market funds
Money market funds that pay taxable dividends may be appropriate for
retirement account funds that await investment as well as non-retirement
190
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

account money when you’re not in a high federal tax bracket and aren’t in a
high state tax bracket (less than 5 percent).
Here are the best taxable money market funds to consider:
 Vanguard’s Prime Money Market
 Fidelity Cash Reserves and Spartan Money Market (higher yields if you
invest $20,000)
 T. Rowe Price Summit Cash Reserves (higher yields if you invest $25,000)
U.S. Treasury money market funds
Consider U.S. Treasury money market funds if you prefer a money market
fund that invests in U.S. Treasuries, which maintain the safety of government
backing, or if you’re not in a high federal tax bracket but are in a high state
tax bracket (5 percent or higher).
The following lists U.S. Treasury funds that I recommend:
 Vanguard Treasury Money Market
 USAA’s Treasury Money Market
 Fidelity’s Spartan U.S. Treasury Money Market ($20,000 minimum)
Municipal money market funds
Municipal (also known as muni) money market funds invest in short-term
debt that state and local governments issue. A municipal money market fund,
which pays you federally tax-free dividends, invests in munis issued by state
and local governments throughout the country. A state-specific municipal
fund invests in state and local government-issued munis for one state, such
as New York. So if you live in New York and buy a New York municipal fund,
the dividends on that fund are federal and New York state tax-free.
So how do you decide whether to buy a nationwide or state-specific munici-
pal money market fund? Federally tax-free-only money market funds may be
appropriate when you’re in a high federal but not a high state bracket (less
than 5 percent).
191
Chapter 8: Selecting Mutual Funds: Stock, Bond, and Money Market Funds

If you’re in a higher state tax bracket, your state may not have good (or any)
state tax-free money market funds available. If you live in any of those states,
you’re likely best off with one of the following national money market funds:
 Vanguard Tax-Exempt Money Market
 T. Rowe Price Summit Municipal Money Market ($25,000 minimum)
 USAA Tax-Exempt Money Market
The state tax-free money market funds in the following list are worth consid-
ering when you’re in a high federal and a high state tax bracket (5 percent or
higher). If none are listed for your state, or you’re only in a high federal tax
bracket, remember that you need to use one of the nationwide muni money
markets that I describe in the previous paragraph.

Chapter 9
Choosing a Brokerage Firm
In This Chapter
 Understanding the different types of brokerage firms
 Shopping for a discount broker
 Surfing for an online broker
You can invest in most securities investments — such as the stocks and
bonds that I discuss in Chapters 4 through 7 — on your own, without
using a broker (if you buy mutual funds direct from fund providers). But
someday, you may need brokerage services. Brokers execute your trades to
buy or sell stocks, bonds, and other securities.
Consider setting up a brokerage account for one or more of the following 
reasons:
 If you hold or invest in individual stocks and bonds
 If you seek to invest in and hold mutual funds from a variety of fund
companies through a single account
 If you desire to have an account with unlimited check writing (possibly
as a replacement to a local checking account)
In this chapter, I explain the ins and outs of discount brokers and online bro-
kers to help you find the right broker for your investment needs.
Getting Your Money’s Worth: 
Discount Brokers
Prior to 1975, all securities brokerage firms charged the same fee, known 
as a commission, to trade stocks and bonds. The Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), the federal government agency responsible for oversee-
ing investment firms and their services, regulated commissions.

Beginning May 1, 1975 — known in the brokerage business as “May Day” —
brokerage firms were free to compete with one another on price, like compa-
nies in almost all other industries. Most of the firms in existence at that time,
such as Prudential, Merrill Lynch, E.F. Hutton, and Smith Barney, largely con-
tinued with business as usual, charging relatively high commissions.
However, a new type of brokerage firm, the discount broker, was born.
Discount brokerage firms charge substantially lower commissions — typically
50 to 75 percent lower — than the other firms. Today, discount brokers,
which include many online brokers, abound and continue to capture the
lion’s share of new business.
When you hear the word discount, you probably think of adjectives like
cheap, inferior quality, and such. However, when it comes to the securities
brokerage field, the discount brokers who place your trades at substantial
discounts can offer you even better value and service than high-cost brokers.
The following list offers some of the reasons why discount brokers give you
more bang for your buck:
 Discount brokers can place your trades at a substantially lower price
because they have much lower overhead.
 Discount brokers tend not to rent the posh downtown office space, com-
plete with mahogany-paneled conference rooms, in order to impress
customers.
 Discounters don’t waste tons of money employing economists and
research analysts to produce forecasts and predictive reports.
In addition to lower commissions, another major benefit of using discount
brokers is that they generally work on salary. Working on salary removes a
significant conflict of interest that continues to get commission-paid brokers
and firms such as Prudential, Salomon Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch, and
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter into trouble. Although many of these firms today
claim to offer financial planning, the reality is that commission-paid brokers
aren’t any different from other salespeople, whether the product is cars, copy
machines, or computers. People who sell on commission to make a living
aren’t inherently evil, but don’t expect to receive holistic, in-your-best-inter-
est investing counsel from them.
Ignoring the salespeople’s arguments
One of the many sales tactics of high-commission brokerage firms is to try to
disparage discounters by saying things such as “You’ll receive poor service
from discounters.” My own experience, as well as that of others, suggests
that in many cases, discounters actually offer better service. Many of the
larger discounters with convenient branch offices offer help that includes
assistance with filling out paperwork and access to independent research
196
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

reports. And as I discuss in Chapter 8, you can buy no-load (commission-free)
mutual funds that are run by management teams that make investment deci-
sions for you. Such funds can be bought from mutual fund companies as well
as through many discount brokerage firms.
High-commission firms used to argue that discount brokerage customers
received worse trade prices when they bought and sold. This assertion is a
bogus argument because all brokerage firms use a computer-based trading
system for smaller retail trades. Trades are processed in seconds. High-
commission brokers also say that discounters are only “for people who 
know exactly what they’re doing and don’t need any help.” This statement is
also false.
Choosing a discount broker
Which discount broker is best for you depends on what your needs and
wants are. In addition to fees, consider how important having a local branch
office is to you. If you seek to invest in mutual funds, the discount brokerage
firms that I list later in this section offer access to good funds. In addition,
these firms offer money market funds into which you can deposit money
awaiting investment or proceeds from a sale.
Within the discount brokerage business, deep discounters are known as firms
that offer the lowest rates but fewer frills and other services. Generally, deep
discounters don’t have local branch offices like big discounters do or offer
money market funds with the highest yields.
Be careful of some deep discounters that offer bargain commissions but stick
it to you in other ways, such as high fees for particular services or below-
market interest rates on money awaiting investment.
Here are my top picks for discount brokers as well as the pros and cons 
of each:
 T. Rowe Price (800-225-5132; www.troweprice.com): T. Rowe Price
offers a solid family of no-load mutual funds that you can also purchase
through its discount brokerage division. The company’s brokerage fees
are competitive and among those on the lower end for discounters. Its 11
branch offices are located in Baltimore; Boston; Colorado Springs; Los
Angeles; Owings Mills, Maryland; Oak Brook, Illinois; San Francisco; Short
Hills, New Jersey; Tampa; Tysons Corner, Virginia; and Washington, D.C.
 Vanguard (800-992-8327; www.vanguard.com): Vanguard is best known
for its excellent family of no-load mutual funds, but its discount broker-
age services have improved over the years. Vanguard has also reduced
its brokerage fees in recent years, and its prices are now near the low
end of discount brokers.
197
Chapter 9: Choosing a Brokerage Firm

 TD Ameritrade (800-934-4448; www.tdwaterhouse.com): At the time
this book goes to press, TD Waterhouse is in the midst of merging with
Ameritrade. Waterhouse Securities merged in the late 1990s with Jack
White and Company to form TD Waterhouse. White was a minimal-frills
deep discounter with only one branch office. Waterhouse offered com-
petitive, but slightly higher, commission rates and nearly 150 branch
offices. The new company offers ’round-the-clock customer assistance.
Please keep a close eye on pricing changes and service quality following
the merger to ensure that the standards are comparable to the old days
of TD Waterhouse.
All the preceding firms offer mutual funds from many fund companies in addi-
tion to their family of funds (if they have a family of funds). In other words,
you may purchase non-T. Rowe Price mutual funds through T. Rowe Price’s
brokerage department. There are certainly other discounters with good serv-
ice and competitive rates, such as Muriel Siebert, so shop around if you
desire. Note, however, that you generally pay a transaction fee to buy funds
from firms that don’t offer their own family of funds.
One final recommendation: If you want a cut-rate discounter for stock and other
securities trading, consider Brown & Company (800-822-2021; www.brownco.
com). The company charges a mere $17 for stock trades that you place via a
market order for up to 5,000 shares ($5 if you trade through its Web site). But be
aware that Brown & Company is a horrible place to keep cash awaiting invest-
ment because its money market yields are abysmal. Also beware of the some-
times-hefty fees that the company levies for special services.
Absent from my list are the large discounters, Fidelity and Schwab. The
simple reason is that those companies charge significantly more than the
competition does, especially for transaction-fee mutual funds. These firms
can get away with premium pricing, despite comparable services, because
enough investors prefer to do business with name-brand companies.
Although I think that both companies can offer investors a fine base from
which to do their investing, I don’t feel that their fees are justified unless you
want to do business with a broker that maintains a branch office in your area.
Considering Online Brokers
For the lowest trading commissions, you generally must place your trades
online. Even if you’ve never visited an online brokerage site, ads for them
online, in print publications, and even on national television have surely bom-
barded you. Visit any Web site that’s remotely related to investing in stocks,
and you’re sure to find ads for various Internet brokers. Anyone familiar with
198
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

the economics of running a brokerage firm can tell you that technology, prop-
erly applied, reduces a broker’s labor costs. Some brokerages — thanks to
technology — can now perform market orders (which means they will execute
your trade at the best current available price) for a mere $5. Hence the attrac-
tion of online trading.
Before you jump at the chance to save a few dollars by trading online, read
the following sections for other considerations that should factor into your
choice of an online broker — or your decision to trade online at all.
Examining your motivations 
for trading online
If trading online attracts you, first examine why you’re motivated to do so.
Tracking prices daily (or, even worse, hourly) and frequently checking your
account balances leads to addictive trading. A low fee of $5 or $10 per trade
doesn’t really save you any money if you trade a lot and rack up significant
total commissions, and you pay more in capital gains taxes. Don’t forget that
as with trading through a regular brokerage firm, you also lose the spread
(difference between the bid and ask prices when you trade), in addition to
the explicit commission rates that online brokers charge.
Frankly, trading online is also an unfortunately easy way for people to act
impulsively and emotionally when making important investment decisions. If
you’re prone to such actions, or you find yourself tracking and trading invest-
ments too closely, use the Internet to check account information and gather
factual information, and stay away from this form of trading.
Know that most of the best investment firms allow you to trade via touch-
tone phone. In most cases, touch-tone phone trading is discounted when you
compare it to trading through a live broker, although it is admittedly less
glamorous than trading through a Web site.
Some brokers also offer account information and trading capabilities via per-
sonal digital assistants, which, of course, add to your costs. Digital assistants
can also promote addictive investment behaviors.
Investment Web sites also push the surging interest in online trading with the
pitch that you can beat the market averages and professionals at their own
game if you do your own research and trade online. Beating the market and
professionals is highly unlikely. However, you can save some money trading
online, but probably not as much as the hype has you believe.
199
Chapter 9: Choosing a Brokerage Firm

Considering other costs
Online brokerage customers often shop for low costs. However, simply talk-
ing with enough people who have traded online and reviewing online mes-
sage boards where customers speak their minds clearly show that shopping
merely for low-cost trading prices often causes the investor to overlook other
important issues.
Some discounters don’t provide toll-free phone numbers, so bear this in mind
if you need to call with questions and service problems. Others charge fees
for real-time stock quotes (as opposed to quotes that may be 15 to 20 min-
utes old and are free). Some brokers whack you $20 here and $50 there for
services such as wiring money or simply closing your account. Also beware
of “inactivity fees” that some brokers levy on accounts that have infrequent
trading. So before you sign up with any broker, make sure that you examine
its entire fee schedule.
When you buy or sell an investment, you may have cash sitting around in
your brokerage account. Not surprisingly, the online brokers pitching their
cheap online trading rates in 3-inch-high numbers don’t reveal their money
market rates in such large type (if at all). Some don’t pay interest on the first
$1,000 or so of your cash balance, and even then, some companies pay half a
percent to a full percent less than their best competitors. In the worst cases,
some online brokers have paid up to 3 percent less. Under those terms, you’d
earn up to $150 less in interest per year if you averaged a $5,000 cash balance
during the year.
Examining service quality
Common complaints among customers of online brokers include slow
responses to e-mail queries, long dead time as you wait to speak with a live
person to answer questions or resolve problems, delays in opening accounts
and receiving literature, unclear statements, incorrect processing of trading
requests, and slow Web response during periods of heavy traffic. With a
number of firms that I called, I experienced phone waits of up to ten minutes
and was transferred several times to retrieve answers to simple questions,
such as whether the firm carried a specific family of mutual funds.
When you shop for an online broker, check your prospects thoroughly. Call
for literature and see how long reaching a live human being takes. Ask some
questions and see how knowledgeable and helpful the representatives are.
For non-retirement accounts, if the quality of the firm’s year-end account
statements concern you, ask prospective brokerages to send you a sample.
200
Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 

Try sending some questions to the broker’s Web site and see how accurate
and timely the response is. If you’re a mutual fund investor, check out the
quality of the funds that the company offers — don’t allow the sheer number
of funds that the company offers impress you. Also, inquire about the interest
rates that the company pays on cash balances, as well as the rates that the
company charges on margin loans, if you want such borrowing services.
Consider checking online message boards to see what current and past cus-
tomers of the firm say about the firms that you’re considering. Most online
brokers that have been around for more than six months lay claim to a
number-one rating with some survey or ranking of online brokers. Place little
value on such claims.
Also, examine what the firm did before it got into the online brokerage busi-
ness. Would you rather put your money and trust in the hands of an estab-
lished and respected financial service company that has been around for a
number of years or an upstart firm run by a couple of people hoping to strike
it rich on the Internet? Transact business only with firms that offer sufficient
account insurance through the Securities Investor Protection Corporation
(SIPC). The severe stock market downturn in the early 2000s led to the first of
what is likely to be many major shakeouts, and you need to protect yourself.

No matter how you trade, keep track of your overall annual returns, minus
trading costs, and see how your performance compares to the market aver-
ages. Unless you invest purely for thrill and education, consider tossing in
your modem for some well-managed mutual funds that won’t glue you to your
computer screen.

Part II: Stocks, Bonds, and Wall Street 
Why you should keep your securities 
in a brokerage account
When most investors purchase stocks or bonds
today, they don’t receive the actual paper cer-
tificate demonstrating ownership. Brokerage
accounts often hold the certificate for your
stocks and bonds on your behalf. Holding your
securities through a brokerage account is ben-
eficial because most brokers charge an extra
fee to issue certificates.
Sometimes people hold stock and bond certifi-
cates themselves — this practice was more
common among your parents’ and grandpar-
ents’ generations. The reason: During the Great
Depression, many brokerage firms failed and
took people’s assets down with their sinking
ships. Since then, various reforms have greatly
strengthened the safety of money and the secu-
rities that you hold in a brokerage account.
Just as the FDIC insurance system backs up
money in bank accounts, the Securities Investor
Protection Corporation (SIPC) provides insur-
ance to investment brokerage firm customers.
The base level of insurance is $500,000 per
account. However, many firms purchase addi-
tional protection — some as high as $100 mil-
lion total!
Brokerage firms don’t often fail these days, but
unlike during the Depression, the SIPC protects
you if they do. However, the SIPC coverage
doesn’t protect you against a falling stock
market. If you invest your money in stocks,
bonds, or whatever that plunge in value, that’s
your own problem!
Besides not having to worry about losing your
securities if a brokerage firm fails, another good
reason to hold securities with a broker is so you
don’t lose them — literally! Surprising numbers
of people — the exact number is unknown —
have lost their stock and bond certificates.
Those who realize their loss can contact the
issuing firms to replace them, but doing so takes
a good deal of time. However, just like future
goals and plans, some certificates are simply
lost, and owners never realize their loss. This
financial fiasco sometimes happens when
people die and their heirs don’t know where to
look for the certificates or the securities that
their loved ones held.
Another reason to hold your securities in a bro-
kerage account is that doing so cuts down on
processing all those dividend checks. For exam-
ple, if you own a dozen stocks that each pay you
a quarterly dividend, you must receive, endorse,
and otherwise deal with 48 separate checks.
Some people enjoy this practice — they say
that doing so is part of the “fun” of owning
securities. My advice: Stick all your securities
in one brokerage account that holds your paid
dividends. Brokerage accounts offer you the
ability to move these payments into a reason-
ably good-yielding money market fund. Most of
the better discount brokers even allow you to
reinvest stock dividends in the purchase of
more shares of that stock at no charge.

Real Estate

In this part . . .
O
wning a home and investing in real estate are time-
proven methods for building wealth. However, if
you’re not careful, you can easily fall prey to a number of
pitfalls. In this part, you discover the right and wrong ways
to purchase real estate and how to build your real estate
empire. Even if you don’t want to be a real estate tycoon,
you also see how simply owning your own home can help
build your net worth and accomplish future financial goals.

Investing in a Home
In This Chapter

F
or most people, buying a home in which to live is their first, best, and
only real estate investment. Homes may require a lot of financial feeding,
but over the course of your life, owning a home (instead of renting) can make
and save you money. And although the pile of mortgage debt seems daunting
in the years just after your purchase, someday your home may be among
your biggest assets.
Even though your home consumes a lot of dough (mortgage payments, prop-
erty taxes, insurance, maintenance, and so on) while you own it, it can help
you accomplish important financial goals, such as:
 Retiring: By the time you hit your 50s and 60s, the size of your monthly
mortgage payment should start to look small or nonexistent. Relatively
low housing costs can help you afford to retire or cut back from full-time
work. Some people are choosing to sell their homes and buy less-costly
ones or to rent the homes out and use some or all the cash to live on in
retirement. Other homeowners enhance their retirement income by
taking out a reverse mortgage to tap the equity (market value of the
home minus the outstanding mortgage debt) that they’ve built up in
their properties.
 Pursuing your small-business dreams: Running your own business can
be a source of great satisfaction. Financial barriers, however, prevent
many people from pulling the plug on a regular job and taking the entre-
preneurial plunge. You may be able to borrow against the equity that
you’ve built up in your home to get the cash you need to start up your
own business. Depending upon what type of business you have in mind,
you may even be able to run your enterprise from your home.

 Financing college: Although it may seem like only yesterday that your
kids were born, soon enough they’re ready for an expensive four-year
undertaking: college. Borrowing against the equity in your home is a
viable way to help pay for your kids’ educational costs.
Perhaps you won’t use your home’s equity for retirement, a small business,
educational expenses, or other important financial goals. But even if you
decide to pass your home on to your children, charity, or a long-lost relative,
it’s still a valuable asset and a worthwhile investment. This chapter explains
how to make the most of it.
The Buying Decision
I believe that most people should buy and own a home. But homeownership
isn’t for everybody and certainly not at all times in your adult life.
The decision about if and when to buy a home may be complex. Money matters,
but so do personal and emotional issues. Buying a home is a big deal — you’re
settling down. Can you really see yourself coming home to this same place
day after day, year after year? Of course, you can always move, but now
you’ve got a financial obligation to deal with.
Weighing the pros and cons 
of homeownership
To hear some people — particularly enthusiastic salespeople in the real
estate business — everybody should own a home. You may hear them say
things like the following:
 Buy a home for the tax breaks.
 Renting is like throwing your money away.
As I discuss later in this chapter, the bulk of homeownership costs — namely,
mortgage interest and property taxes — are tax-deductible. However, these
tax breaks are already largely factored into the higher cost of owning a home.
(If such tax breaks didn’t exist, housing prices would be lower because the
effective cost of owning would be so much higher.) So don’t buy a home just
because of the tax breaks.
206
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

Renting isn’t necessarily “throwing your money away.” In fact, renting can
have a number of benefits:
 In some communities, with a given type of property, renting is less
costly than buying. Happy and successful renters that I’ve seen include
people who pay low rent, perhaps because they’ve made housing sacri-
fices. If you’re able to sock away 10 percent or more of your earnings
while renting, you’re probably well on your way to accomplishing your
future financial goals.
 You can save money and hopefully invest in other financial assets.
Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds are quite accessible and possibly help-
ful in retirement. Most homeowners, by contrast, have a substantial por-
tion of their wealth tied up in their homes. (Accessibility is a
double-edged sword, because it may tempt you as a cash-rich renter to
blow the money in the short term.)
 Renting has potential emotional and psychological rewards. First is
the not-so-inconsequential fact that you have more flexibility to pack up
and move on. You may have a lease to fulfill, but you can renegotiate it if
you need to move on. As a homeowner, you have a large monthly pay-
ment to take care of — to some people, this responsibility feels like a
financial ball and chain. After all, you have no guarantee that you can
sell your home in a timely fashion or at the price you desire if you want
to move.
Although renting has its benefits, renting has at least one big drawback: expo-
sure to inflation. As the cost of living increases, your landlord can keep jack-
ing up your rent (unless you live in a rent-controlled unit). If you’re a
homeowner, however, the big monthly expense of the mortgage payment
doesn’t increase, assuming that you buy your home with a fixed-rate mort-
gage. (Your property taxes, homeowners insurance, and maintenance
expenses are exposed to inflation, but these expenses are usually much
smaller in comparison to your monthly mortgage payment or rent.)
Here’s a quick example to show you how inflation can work against you as a
long-term renter. Suppose that you’re comparing the costs of owning a home
that costs $160,000 to renting a similar property for $800 a month. (If you’re
in a high-cost urban area and these numbers seem low, please bear with me
and focus on the numbers and accompanying insights, which you can apply
to higher-cost areas.) Buying at $160,000 sounds a lot more expensive than
renting, doesn’t it? But this isn’t a fair apples-to-apples comparison. You must
compare the monthly cost of owning to the monthly cost of renting. You must
also factor in the tax benefits of homeownership (mortgage interest and
property taxes are tax-deductible) to your comparison so that you compare
the after-tax monthly cost of owning versus renting. Figure 10-1 does just that
over 30 years.
207
Chapter 10: Investing in a Home

As you can see in Figure 10-1, although it costs more in the early years to
own, owning should be less expensive in the long run. Renting is higher in the
long term because all your rental expenses increase with inflation. Note: I
haven’t factored in the potential change in the value of your home over time.
Over long periods of time, home prices tend to appreciate, which makes
owning even more attractive.
The example in Figure 10-1 assumes that you make a 20 percent down pay-
ment and take out a 7 percent fixed-rate mortgage to purchase the property. I
also assumed that the rate of inflation of your homeowners insurance, prop-
erty taxes, maintenance, and rent is 4 percent per year. If inflation is lower,
renting doesn’t necessarily become cheaper in the long term. In the absence
of inflation, your rent should escalate less, but your homeownership expenses,
which are subject to inflation (property taxes, maintenance, and insurance),
should increase less, too. And with low inflation, you can probably refinance
your mortgage at a lower interest rate, which reduces your monthly mort-
gage payments. With low or no inflation, owning can still cost less, but the
savings versus renting usually aren’t as dramatic as when inflation is greater.
Considering transaction costs and 
time needed to recoup them
Financially speaking, I advise that you wait to buy a home until you can see
yourself staying put for a minimum of three years. Ideally, I’d like you to think
that you have a solid chance of staying with the home for five or more years.
Why? Buying and selling a home cost big bucks. Some of the expenses you’ll
face include:

 Inspection fees: You shouldn’t buy a property without thoroughly
checking it out, so you’ll incur inspection expenses. Good inspectors
can help you identify problems with the plumbing, heating, and electri-
cal systems. They also check out the foundation, roof, and so on and let
you know whether termites are living in the house.
 Loan costs: The costs of getting a mortgage include such items as the
points (upfront interest that can run 1 to 2 percent of the loan amount),
application and credit report fees, and appraisal fees.
 Title insurance: When you buy a home, you and your lender need to
protect yourselves against the chance — albeit small — that the prop-
erty seller doesn’t actually legally own the home that you’re buying.
That’s where title insurance comes in — it protects you financially from
unscrupulous sellers.
 Moving costs: You can transport all that furniture, clothing, and other
personal belongings yourself, but your time is worth something, and
your moving skills are likely limited. Besides, do you want to end up in a
hospital emergency room after you’re pinned at the bottom of a stairwell
by a runaway couch?
 Real estate agents’ commissions: A commission of 5 to 7 percent of the
purchase price of most homes goes into the pockets of real estate sales-
people and the companies they work for.
On top of all these transaction costs of buying and then selling a home, you
will also face maintenance expenses — for example, fixing leaky pipes and
painting. To cover all the transaction and maintenance costs of homeowner-
ship, the value of your home needs to appreciate about 15 percent over the
years that you own it just for you to be as well off financially as if you had
continued renting. Fifteen percent! If you need or want to move elsewhere in
a few years, counting on that kind of appreciation in those few years is risky.
If you happen to buy just before a sharp rise in housing prices, you may get
this much appreciation in a short time. But you can’t count on this upswing —
you’re more likely to lose money on such a short-term deal.
Some people invest in real estate even when they don’t expect to live in the
home for long and may consider turning their home into a rental if they move
within a few years. Doing so can work well financially in the long haul, but
don’t underestimate the responsibilities that come with rental property,
which I discuss in Chapter 11.
Deciding How Much to Spend
Buying a home is a long-term financial commitment. You’ll probably take out
a 15- to 30-year mortgage to finance your purchase, and the home that you
209
Chapter 10: Investing in a Home

buy will need maintenance over the years. So before you make a decision to
buy, take stock of your overall financial health.
If you have good credit and a reliable source of employment, lenders will
eagerly offer to loan you money. They’ll tell you how much you may borrow
from them — the maximum that you’re qualified to borrow. But that doesn’t
mean that you should borrow the maximum.
If you buy a home without considering your other monthly expenditures and
long-term goals, you may end up with a home that dictates much of your
future spending. Have you considered, for example, how much you need to
save monthly to reach your retirement goals? How about the amount that
you want to spend on recreation and entertainment?
If you want to continue your current lifestyle, you have to be honest with
yourself about how much you can really afford to spend as a homeowner.
210
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Knowing when to buy
If you’re considering buying a home, you may be
concerned whether home prices are poised to
rise or fall. No one wants to purchase a home
that then plummets in value. And who wouldn’t
like to buy just before prices go on an upward
trajectory?
It’s not easy to predict what’s going to happen
with real estate prices in a particular city, state,
or country over the next one, two, or three or
more years. Ultimately, the economic health and
vitality of an area drive the demand and prices
for homes in that area. An increase in jobs, par-
ticularly ones that pay well, increases the
demand for housing. And when demand goes
up, so do prices.
If you first buy a home when you’re in your 20s,
30s, or even your 40s, you may end up as a
homeowner for several or more decades. Over
such a long time, you may experience lots of
ups and downs, but most likely more ups than
downs, so I wouldn’t be too concerned about
trying to predict what’s going to happen to the
real estate market in the near term. I know some
long-term renters who avoided buying homes
years ago because they thought that prices
were expensive and have missed out on
tremendous appreciation in real estate values.
That said, you may be, at particular times in your
life, ambivalent about buying a home. Perhaps
you’re not sure that you’ll stay put for more than
three to five years. Therefore, part of your
home-buying decision may hinge on whether
current home prices in your local area offer you
a good value. The level of real estate prices as
compared to rent, the state of the job market,
and the number of home listings for sale are
useful indicators of the housing market’s health.
Trying to time your purchase has more impor-
tance if you think that you may move in less than
five years. In that case, avoid buying in a high
market. If you expect to move so soon, renting
generally makes more sense because of the
high transaction costs of buying and selling real
estate.

First-time homebuyers in particular run into financial trouble when they
don’t understand their current spending. Buying a home can be a wise deci-
sion, but it can also be a huge burden. And there are all sorts of nifty things
to buy for a home. Some people prop up their spending habits with credit
cards — a dangerous practice.
Don’t let your home control your financial future. Before you buy property or
agree to a particular mortgage, be sure that you can afford to do so — be
especially careful not to ignore your retirement planning (if you hope to
someday retire). Start by reading Chapter 3. After reading the following sec-
tions, you can also check out Chapter 12, where I cover mortgages and
financing options in greater detail.
Looking through lenders’ eyes
All mortgage lenders want to gauge your ability to repay the money that you
borrow, so you have to pass a few tests. Mortgage lenders calculate the maxi-
mum amount that you can borrow to buy a piece of real estate.
For a home in which you will reside, lenders total your monthly housing
expenses. They define your housing costs as:
Mortgage payment + property taxes + insurance
A lender doesn’t consider maintenance and upkeep expenses in owning a
home. Although lenders may not care where you spend money outside your
home, they do care about your other debt. A lot of other debt, such as credit
cards or auto loans, diminishes the funds that are available to pay your hous-
ing expenses. Lenders know that having other debt increases the possibility
that you may fall behind or actually default on your mortgage payments.
If you have consumer debt that requires monthly payments, lenders calculate
another ratio to determine the maximum that you can borrow. Lenders add
the amount that you need to pay down your other consumer debt to your
monthly housing expense.
Consumer debt is bad news even without considering that it hurts your quali-
fication for a mortgage. Consumer debt is costly and encourages you to live
beyond your means. Unlike the interest on mortgage debt, consumer debt
interest isn’t tax-deductible. Get rid of it — curtail your spending and adjust
to living within your means. If you can’t live within your means as a renter,
doing so is going to be even harder as a homeowner.
211
Chapter 10: Investing in a Home

Determining your down payment
Another factor to consider when you decide how much you should borrow is
that most lenders require you to purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI) if
your down payment is less than 20 percent of your home’s purchase price.
PMI protects the lender from getting stuck with a property that may be worth
less than the mortgage you owe, in the event that you default on your loan.
On a moderate-size loan, PMI can add hundreds of dollars per year to your
payments.
If you have to take PMI to buy a home with less than 20 percent down, keep
an eye on your home’s value and your loan balance. Over time, your property
should appreciate, and your loan balance should decrease as you make
monthly payments. After your mortgage represents 80 percent or less of the
market value of the home, you can get rid of the PMI (doing so entails con-
tacting your lender and usually requires you to pay for an appraisal).
I am generally not a fan of the increasingly promoted interest-only loans,
which entice cash-strapped buyers with lower monthly payments, because
all of the initial payments go toward interest. These loans typically have
212
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Homeownership tax savings
Your mortgage interest and property taxes are
tax-deductible on Form 1040, Schedule A of your
personal tax return. When you calculate the
costs of owning a home, subtract the tax sav-
ings to get a more complete and accurate sense
of what homeownership will cost you.
When you finally buy a home, be sure to refigure
how much you need to pay in income tax,
because your mortgage interest and property
tax deductions can help lower your tax bill. If
you work for an employer, ask your payroll/ben-
efits department for Form W-4. If you’re self-
employed, you can complete a worksheet that
comes with Form 1040-ES. (Call 800-TAX-FORM
for a copy.) Many new homebuyers don’t bother
with this step, and they receive a big tax refund
on their next filed income tax return. Although
getting money back from the IRS may feel good,
it means that at a minimum, you gave the IRS 
an interest-free loan. In the worst-case sce-
nario, the reduced cash flow during the year
may cause you to accumulate debt or miss out
on contributing to tax-deductible retirement
accounts.
If you want a more precise estimate as to how
homeownership may affect your tax situation,
get out your tax return and plug in some rea-
sonable numbers to “guesstimate” how your
taxes may change. You can also speak with a
tax advisor.
Last but not least, eligible homeowners can
exclude from taxable income a significant por-
tion of their gain on the sale of a principal resi-
dence: up to $250,000 for single taxpayers and
$500,000 for married couples filing jointly.

worse terms (interest rate and fees) than conventional mortgages and cause
some buyers to take on more debt than they can handle. After a number of
years, the payment amount jumps higher when the principal and interest
begin to be repaid together.
What if you have so much money that you can afford to put down more than
a 20 percent down payment? How much should you put down then? (This
problem doesn’t usually arise — most buyers, especially first-time buyers,
struggle to get a 20 percent down payment together.) The answer depends on
what else you can or want to do with the money. If you’re considering other
investment opportunities, determine whether you can expect to earn a
higher rate of return on those other investments versus the interest rate that
you’ll pay on the mortgage. Forget about the tax deduction for your mortgage
interest. Yes, the interest is deductible, but don’t forget that the earnings
from your investments are taxable.
During the past century, stock market and real estate investors have enjoyed
average annual returns of around 10 percent per year. So if you borrow mort-
gage money at around 7 to 8 percent, in the long term you should come out 
2 to 3 percent ahead if you use the money you would have put toward a
larger down payment to invest in such growth investments. You aren’t guar-
anteed, of course, that your other investments can earn 10 percent yearly.
(Remember that past returns don’t guarantee the future.) And don’t forget
that all investments come with risk. The advantage of putting more money
down for a home and borrowing less is that it’s essentially a risk-free invest-
ment (as long as you have adequate insurance on your property).
If you prefer to put down just 20 percent and invest more money elsewhere,
that’s fine. Just don’t keep the extra money (beyond an emergency reserve)
under the mattress, in a savings account, or in bonds that pay less interest
than your mortgage costs you in interest. Invest in stocks, real estate, or a
small business. Otherwise, you don’t have a chance at earning a higher
return than the cost of your mortgage, and you’re therefore better off paying
down your mortgage.
Selecting Your Property Type
If you’re ready to buy a home, you must make some decisions about what
and where to buy. If you grew up in the suburbs, your image of a home may
include the traditional single-family home with a lawn, a couple of kids, and
the family pets. But single-family homes, of course, aren’t the only or even
the main types of residential housing in many areas, especially in some
higher-cost, urban neighborhoods. Other common types of higher-density
housing include the following:
213
Chapter 10: Investing in a Home

 Condominiums: These are generally apartment-style units that are
stacked on top of and adjacent to one another. Many condo buildings
were originally apartments that were converted — through the sale of
ownership of separate units — into condos. When you purchase a con-
dominium, you purchase a specific unit as well as a share of the
common areas (for example, the pool, grass and other plantings, entry
and hallways, laundry room, and so on).
 Townhomes: Townhome is just a fancy way of saying attached or row
home. Think of townhomes as a cross between a condominium and a
single-family house. Townhomes are condolike because they’re attached
(generally sharing walls and a roof) and are homelike because they’re
often two-story buildings that come with a small yard.
 Cooperatives: Cooperatives (usually called co-ops) resemble apartment
and condominium buildings. When you buy a share in a cooperative,
you own a share of the entire building, including some living space.
Unlike in a condo, you generally need to get approval from the coopera-
tive association if you want to remodel or rent your unit to a tenant. In
some co-ops, you must even gain approval from the association for the
sale of your unit to a proposed buyer. Co-ops are generally much harder
to obtain loans for and to sell, so I don’t recommend that you buy one
unless you get a good deal and can easily obtain a loan.
All types of shared housing (the types of housing in the preceding list) offer
two potential advantages. First, this type of housing generally gives you more
living space for your dollars. This value makes sense because with a single-
family home, a good chunk of the cost for the property is for the land that the
home sits upon. Land is good for decks, recreation, and playing children, but
you don’t live “in” it the way you do with your home. Shared housing maxi-
mizes living space for the housing dollars that you spend.
Another benefit of shared housing is that in many situations, you’re not per-
sonally responsible for general maintenance. Instead, the homeowners asso-
ciation (which you pay into) takes care of it. If you don’t have the time,
energy, or desire to keep up a property, shared housing can make sense.
Shared housing units may also give you access to recreation facilities, such
as a pool, tennis courts, and exercise equipment.
So why doesn’t everyone purchase shared housing? Well, as investments,
single-family homes generally perform better in the long run. In a good real
estate market, single-family homes and other types of housing appreciate, but
single-family homes tend to outperform other housing types. Shared housing
is easier to build (and to overbuild) — and the greater supply tends to keep
its prices depressed. Single-family homes tend to attract more potential
buyers — most people, when they can afford it, prefer a stand-alone home,
especially for the increased privacy.
214
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

If you can afford a smaller single-family home instead of a larger shared-housing
unit, buy the single-family home. Shared housing makes more sense for people
who don’t want to deal with building maintenance and who value the security
of living in a larger building with other people. Also know that shared-housing
prices tend to hold up better in developed urban environments. If possible,
avoid shared housing units in suburban areas where the availability of devel-
opable land makes building many more units possible, thus increasing the
supply of housing and slowing growth in values.
If shared housing interests you, make sure that you have the property thor-
oughly inspected. Also, examine the trend in maintenance fees over time to
ensure that these costs are under control. (See Chapter 11 for more specifics
on how to check out property.)
Finding the Right Property and Location
Some people know where they want to live, so they look at just a handful of
properties and then buy. Most people take much more time — finding the
right house in a desired area at a fair price can take a lot of time. Buying a
home can also entail much compromise when you buy with other family
members (particularly spouses).
Be realistic about how long it may take you to get up to speed about different
areas and to find a home that meets your various desires and concerns. If
you’re a normal person with a full-time job and you’re confined to occasional
weekends and evenings to look for a house, three to six months is a short
amount of time to settle on an area and actually find and successfully negotiate
on a property. Six months to a year isn’t unusual or slow. Remember that you’re
talking about an enormous purchase that you’ll come home to every day.
Real estate agents can be a big barrier to taking your time with this monu-
mental decision. Some agents are pushy and want to make a sale and get
their commission. Don’t work with such agents as a buyer — they can make
you miserable, unhappy, and broke. If necessary, begin your search without
an agent to avoid this outside pressure.
Keep an open mind
Before you start your search, you may have an idea about the type of prop-
erty and location that interests you or that you think you can afford. You may
think, for example, that you can afford only a condominium in the neighbor-
hood that you want. But if you take the time to check out other communities,
215
Chapter 10: Investing in a Home

you may find another area that meets most of your needs and has affordable
single-family homes. You’d never know that, though, if you narrowed your
search too quickly.
Even if you’ve lived in an area for a while and think that you know it well, look
at different types of properties in a variety of locations before you start to
narrow your search. Be open-minded and make sure that you know which of
your many criteria for a home you really care about. You will likely have to be
flexible with some of your preferences.
After you focus on a particular area or neighborhood, make sure that you see
the full range of properties available. If you want to spend $200,000 on a
home, look at properties that are more expensive. Most real estate sells for
less than its listing price, and you may feel comfortable spending a little bit
more after you see what you can purchase if you stretch your budget a little
bit. Also, if you work with an agent, make sure that you don’t overlook homes
that are for sale by their owners (that is, not listed with real estate agents).
Otherwise, you may miss out on some good properties.
Research, research, research
Thinking that you can know what an area is like from anecdotes or from a
small number of personal experiences is a mistake. You may have read or
heard that someone was mugged in a particular area. That doesn’t make that
area dangerous — or more dangerous than others. Get the facts. Anecdotes
and people’s perceptions often aren’t accurate reflections of the facts. Check
out the following key items:
 Amenities: Hopefully, you don’t spend all your time at work, slaving
away to make your monthly mortgage payment. I hope that you have
time to use parks, sports and recreation facilities, and so on. You can
drive around the neighborhood you’re interested in to get a sense of
these attractions. Most real estate agents just love to show off their
favorite neighborhoods. Cities and towns can also mail you information
booklets that detail what they have to offer and where you can find it.
 Schools: If you have kids, you care about this issue a lot. Unfortunately,
many people make snap judgments about school quality without doing
their homework. Visit the schools and don’t blindly rely on test scores.
Talk to parents and teachers and discover what goes on at the schools.
If you don’t have (or want!) school-age children, you may be tempted to
say, “What the heck do I care about the quality of the schools?” You need
to care about the schools because even if you don’t have kids, the qual-
ity of the local schools has direct bearing on the value of your property.
216
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

Consider these issues even if they’re not important to you, because they
can affect the resale value of your property.
 Property taxes: What will your property taxes be? Property tax rates
vary from community to community. Check with the town’s assessment
office or with a good real estate agent.
 Crime: Call the local police department or visit your public library to get
the facts on crime. Cities and towns keep all sorts of crime statistics for
neighborhoods — use them!
 Future development: Check with the planning department in towns that
you’re considering living in to find out what types of new development
and major renovations are in the works. Planning people may also be
aware of problems in particular areas.
 Catastrophic risks: Are the neighborhoods that you’re considering buying
a home in susceptible to major risks, such as floods, tornadoes, mud-
slides, fires, or earthquakes? Although proper homeowners insurance can
protect you financially, consider how you may deal with such catastro-
phes emotionally — insurance eases only the financial pain of a home
loss. All areas have some risk, and a home in the safest of areas can burn
to the ground. Although you can’t eliminate all risks, you can at least edu-
cate yourself about the potential catastrophic risks in various areas.
If you’re new to an area or don’t have a handle on an area’s risks, try a
number of different sources. Knowledgeable and honest real estate
agents may help, but you can also dig for primary information. For
example, the U.S. Geologic Survey (USGS) puts together maps that help
you see potential earthquake risks by area. The USGS maintains offices
all around the country — check your local phone directory in the gov-
ernment White Pages section (or visit the agency online at www.usgs.
gov). The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides
maps that show flood risk areas. (Call FEMA at 800-358-9616 or check its
Web site at www.fema.gov.) Insurance companies and agencies can also
tell you what they know about risks in particular areas.
Understanding market value
Over many months, you’ll look at lots of properties for sale, perhaps dozens
or even hundreds. Use these viewings as an opportunity to find out what
places are worth. The listing price isn’t what a house is worth — it may be,
but odds are it’s not. Property that is priced to sell usually does just that — it
sells. Properties left on the market are often overpriced. The listing price on
such properties may reflect what an otherwise greedy or uninformed seller
and his agent hope that some fool will pay.
217
Chapter 10: Investing in a Home

Of the properties that you see, keep track of the prices that they end up sell-
ing for. (Good agents can help you obtain this information.) Properties usu-
ally sell for less than the listed price. Keeping track of selling prices gives you
a good handle on what properties are really worth and a better sense of what
you can afford.
Pounding the pavement
After you set your sights on that special home, thoroughly check out the sur-
roundings — you should know what you’re getting yourself into.
Go back to the neighborhood in which the property is located at different
times of the day and on different days of the week. Knock on a few doors and
meet your potential neighbors. Ask questions. Talk to property owners as
well as renters. Because they don’t have a financial stake in the area, renters
are often more forthcoming with negative information about an area.
After you decide where and what to buy, you’re ready to try to put a deal
together. I cover issues common to both home and investment property pur-
chases — such as mortgages, negotiations, inspections, and so on — in
Chapter 12.

I
f you’ve already bought your own home (and even if you haven’t), using
real estate as an investment may interest you. Over the years, decades,
and centuries, real estate investing, like the stock market and small-business
investments, has generated tremendous wealth for participants. (Please see
Chapter 2 for more on the rate of return from good real estate investments)
Real estate is like other types of ownership investments, such as stocks,
where you have an ownership stake in an asset. Although you have the
potential for significant profits, don’t forget that you also accept greater risk.
Real estate isn’t a gravy train or a simple way to get wealthy. Like stocks, real
estate goes through good and bad performance periods. Most people who
make money investing in real estate do so because they invest and hold prop-
erty over many years. The vast majority of people who don’t make money in
real estate don’t because they make easily avoidable mistakes. In this chap-
ter, I discuss how to make the best real estate investments and avoid the rest.
Outlining Real Estate 
Investment Attractions
As I discuss in Chapter 1, many types of people build their wealth by invest-
ing in real estate. Some people focus exclusively on real estate investments,
but many others build their wealth through the companies that they started
or through other avenues and then diversify into real estate investments.
What do these wealthy folks know, and why do they choose to invest in real
estate? In the following sections, I cover some of real estate’s attractions

Real estate, like all investments, has its pros and cons. Investing in real estate
is time intensive and carries investment and other risks. Invest in real estate
because you enjoy the challenge of the business and because you want to diver-
sify your portfolio (an advantage of real estate is that its value doesn’t move
in tandem with other investments, such as stocks or small-business invest-
ments that you hold). Don’t take this route because you seek a get-rich-quick
outlet.
Limited land
Short of using landfill to build buildings over water, the supply of land on
planet Earth is fixed. And because people are prone to reproduce (I must con-
fess to being party to this as well), demand for land and housing continues to
grow. Land and what you can do with it are what make real estate valuable.
Cities and islands such as Hawaii, Tokyo, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and
New York City have the highest housing costs around because land is limited
in these places.
Leverage
Real estate is different from most other investments in that you can borrow
up to 80 to 90 percent (or more) of the value of the property. Thus, you can
use your small down payment of 10 to 20 percent of the purchase price to
buy, own, and control a much larger investment. Of course, you hope that the
value of your real estate goes up — if it does, you make money on your
investment as well as on the money that you borrowed.
Here’s a quick example to illustrate. Suppose that you purchase a rental 
property for $100,000 and make a $20,000 down payment. Over the next three
years, imagine that the property appreciates to $120,000. Thus, you have a
profit (on paper at least) of $20,000 on an investment of just $20,000. In other
words, you’ve made a 100 percent return on your investment. (Note that in
this scenario, I ignore whether your expenses from the property exceed the
rental income that you collect.)
Leverage is good for you if property prices appreciate, but leverage can also
work against you. If your $100,000 property decreases in value to $80,000, even
though it’s dropped only 20 percent in value, you actually lose (on paper) 100
percent of your original $20,000 investment. If you have an outstanding mort-
gage of $80,000 on this property and you need to sell, you actually must pay
money into the sale to cover selling costs, in addition to losing your entire
original investment. Ouch!
220
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

Appreciation and income
Another reason that real estate is a popular investment is that you can make
money from it in two major ways. First, you hope and expect that over the
years, your real estate investments will appreciate in value. The appreciation
of your properties compounds tax deferred during your years of ownership.
You don’t pay tax on this profit until you sell your property — and even then
you can roll over your gain into another investment property and avoid
paying tax. (See the “Roll over those rental property profits” sidebar, later in
this chapter, for details on tax-deferred exchanges of investment properties.)
Thanks to tax law changes in the early 2000s, if you choose to simply take
your profits and not roll them over, the federal tax rate on gains from prop-
erty held more than one year — known as long-term capital gains — are
taxed at no more than 15 percent. That’s a heck of a deal when you consider
that ordinary income can be taxed at rates approaching 40 percent.
In addition to making money from your properties’ increase in value, you 
can also make money from the ongoing business that you run — renting the
221
Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate
Roll over those rental property profits
When you sell a stock or mutual fund invest-
ment that you hold outside a retirement
account, you must pay tax on your profits. By
contrast, if you roll over your gain into another
like-kind investment real estate property, you
can avoid paying tax on your rental property
profit when you sell.
The rules for properly making one of these 
(IRS code section) 1031 exchanges (also called
Starker exchanges) are complex and usually
involve third parties. With like-kind transactions,
you don’t receive the proceeds of the sale —
they must go into an escrow account (explained
in Chapter 12). You must complete the rollover
within a six-month time limit, and you must also
identify a replacement property within 45 days
of the sale of the first property. Make sure that
you find an attorney and/or tax advisor who is
an expert at these transactions to ensure that
everything goes smoothly (and legally).
If you don’t roll over your gain, you may owe sig-
nificant taxes because of how the IRS defines
your gain. For example, if you buy a property for
$200,000 and sell it for $250,000, you not only
owe tax on that difference, but you also owe tax
on an additional amount, depending on the
property’s depreciation. The amount of depreci-
ation that you deducted on your tax returns
reduces the original $200,000 purchase price,
making the taxable difference that much larger.
For example, if you deducted $25,000 for depre-
ciation over the years that you owned the prop-
erty, you owe tax on the difference between the
sale price of $250,000 and $175,000 ($200,000
purchase price minus $25,000 depreciation).

property. You rent out investment property to make a profit based on the prop-
erty’s rental income that (hopefully) exceeds your expenses (mortgage, prop-
erty taxes, insurance, maintenance, and so on). Unless you make a large down
payment, your monthly operating profit is small or nonexistent in the early
years of rental property ownership. Over time, your operating profit, which is
subject to ordinary income tax, should rise as you increase your rental prices
faster than your expenses. During soft periods in the local economy, however,
rents may rise more slowly than your expenses (or rents may even fall).
Ability to “add value”
You can’t add value to stocks by “fixing them up,” but you may have some
good ideas about how to improve a property and make it more valuable.
Perhaps you can fix up a property or develop it further and raise the rental
income and resale value accordingly. Through legwork, persistence, and good
negotiating skills, you can purchase a property below its fair market value.
Relative to investing in the stock market, tenacious and savvy real estate
investors can more easily buy property below its fair market value. You can
do the same in the stock market, but the scores of professional, full-time
money managers who analyze stocks make finding bargains more difficult.
Ego gratification
Face it, investing in real estate appeals to some investors because buildings are
tangible. Although few admit it, some real estate investors get an ego rush from
a tangible display of their wealth. You can drive past investment real estate and
show it off to others. In “What My Ego Wants, My Ego Gets,” a piece appropri-
ately written for The New York Times, Donald Trump publicly admitted what
most everyone else knew long ago: He holds his real estate investments partly
for his ego. Trump confessed of his purchase of the famed Plaza Hotel in the
Big Apple, “I realized it was 100 percent true — ego did play a large role in the
Plaza purchase and is, in fact, a significant factor in all of my deals.”
Longer-term focus
One problem with investing in the securities markets, such as the stock
market, is that prices are constantly changing. Newspapers, television news
programs, and Web sites dutifully report the latest price quotes. From my
observations and my work with individual investors, I’ve seen the constant
changes in the financial markets and the constant reports on those changes
cause some investors to lose sight of the long term and the big picture. In the
worst cases, large short-term drops lead investors to panic and sell at what
end up being bargain prices. Or headlines about big increases pull investors
222
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

in lemminglike fashion into an overheated and peaking market. Because all
you need to do is click your computer mouse or dial a toll-free phone number
to place your sell or buy order, some stock market investors fall prey to snap,
irrational judgments.
Like the stock market, the real estate market is constantly changing. However,
to a real estate investor, short-term, day-to-day, and week-to-week changes
are invisible. Publications don’t report the value of your real estate holdings
daily, weekly, or even monthly, which is good because it encourages a longer-
term focus. If prices do decline over the months and years, you’re much less
likely to sell in a panic with real estate. Preparing a property for sale and
eventually getting it sold take a good deal of time, and this barrier to quickly
selling helps keep your vision in focus.
223
Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate
Real estate investing isn’t 
as wonderful as they say
If you’ve attempted to read or have read some
of the many real estate investment books that
have been published over the years, you may
need to slightly deprogram yourself. Too often,
authors attempt to make real estate investments
sound like the one and only sure way to become
a multimillionaire with little effort. Consider the
following statements made by real estate book
authors. My rebuttals to their claims follow:
“Rather than yielding only a small interest pay-
ment or dividend, real estate in prime locations
can appreciate 20 percent a year or more.”
Bank accounts, bonds, and stocks pay interest
or dividends that typically amount to 2 to 6 per-
cent per year (the total return on stocks is about
10 percent per year). However, bank accounts
and bonds aren’t comparable investments to
stocks or real estate — they’re far more con-
servative and liquid and therefore don’t offer the
potential for double-digit returns. Stock market
investing is comparable to investing in real
estate, but you shouldn’t go into real estate
investments expecting annual returns of 20 per-
cent or more. Those who purchased good Los
Angeles real estate in the 1950s and held onto it
for the next three decades earned handsome
returns as the population of this area boomed.
Finding areas like Los Angeles and knowing
how long to hold on to investments in these
areas is easier said than done. With real estate
investments, you can expect to earn 8 to 12 per-
cent per year, but not 20 percent or more.
“A good piece of property can’t do anything but
go up!”
Any city, town, or community has good pieces
of real estate. But that doesn’t mean that com-
munities can’t and won’t have slow or
depressed years. Real estate in some parts of
the Midwest and South, for example, has appre-
ciated quite slowly — at or just above the rate
of inflation — for periods as long as a genera-
tion or more.
“Real estate is the best way of preserving and
enhancing wealth. . . . [it] stands head and
shoulders above any other form of investment.”
Investing in stocks or in a small business is
every bit as profitable as investing in real estate.
In fact, more great fortunes have been built in
small business than in any other form of invest-
ment. Over the long-term, stock market investors
have enjoyed (with far less hassle) average
annual rates of return comparable to real estate
investors’ returns.

Figuring Out Who Should Avoid 
Real Estate Investing
Real estate investing isn’t for everyone; not even close. Most people do
better financially when they invest their ownership holdings in a diversified
portfolio of stocks, such as through stock mutual funds. Shy away from real
estate investments that involve managing property if you fall into any of the
following categories:
 You’re time starved and anxious. Buying and owning investment real
estate and being a landlord take a lot of time. If you fail to do your home-
work before purchasing property, you can end up overpaying — or
buying a heap of trouble. As for managing a property, you can hire a
property manager to help with screening and finding good tenants and
troubleshooting problems with the building, but this step costs money
and still requires some time involvement. Also, remember that most ten-
ants don’t care for a property the same way property owners do. If every
little scratch or carpet stain sends your blood pressure skyward, avoid
distressing yourself as a landlord.
 You’re not interested in real estate. Some people simply don’t feel com-
fortable and informed when it comes to investing in real estate. If you’ve
had experience and success with stock market investing, that’s a good
reason to stick with it and avoid real estate. Over long periods of time,
both stocks and real estate provide comparable returns.
Looking at Simple, Profitable 
Real Estate Investments
Investing in rental real estate that you’re responsible for can be a lot of work.
With rental properties, you have all the headaches of maintaining a property,
including finding and dealing with tenants, without the benefits of living in
and enjoying the property.
Unless you’re extraordinarily interested in and motivated to own investment
real estate, start with and perhaps limit your real estate investing to a couple
of much simpler yet still profitable methods that I discuss in this section.
A place to call home
During your adult life, you need a roof over your head. However, you may be
able to sponge off your folks or some other relative for a number of years. If
224
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

you’re content with this arrangement, you can minimize your housing costs
and save more for a down payment and possibly toward other goals. Go for
it, if your relatives will!
But what if neither you nor your relatives are up for the challenge? For the
long term, because you need a place to live, why not own real estate instead
of renting it? Real estate is the only investment that you can live in or rent to
produce income. You can’t live in a stock, bond, or mutual fund! Unless you
expect to move within the next few years, buying a place probably makes
good long-term financial sense. In the long term, owning usually costs less
than renting and allows you to build equity in an asset. Read Chapter 10 to
find out more about profiting from homeownership.
Real estate investment trusts
Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are entities that generally invest in differ-
ent types of property, such as shopping centers, apartments, and other rental
buildings. For a fee, REIT managers identify and negotiate the purchase of
properties that they believe are good investments and manage these proper-
ties, including all tenant relations. Thus, REITs are a good way to invest in
real estate for people who don’t want the hassles and headaches that come
with directly owning and managing rental property.
225
Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate
What about converting your current 
home into a rental when you move?
If you move into another home, turning your cur-
rent home into a rental property may make
sense. After all, it saves you the time and cost
of finding a separate rental property.
Unfortunately, many people make the mistake of
holding on to their current home for the wrong
reasons when they buy another. This situation
often happens when homeowners must sell
their home in a depressed market. Nobody likes
to lose money and sell their home for less than
they paid for it. Thus, some owners hold on to
their homes until prices recover.
If you plan to move and want to keep your cur-
rent home as a long-term investment property,
you can. But turning your home into a short-
term rental is usually a bad move for a couple of
reasons. First, you may not want the responsi-
bilities of a landlord, yet you force yourself into
the landlord business when you convert your
home into a rental.
Second, if the home eventually does rebound in
value, you owe tax on the profit if your property
is a rental when you sell it and don’t buy another
rental property. You can purchase another
rental property through a 1031 exchange to
defer paying taxes on your profit. (See the “Roll
over those rental property profits” sidebar, ear-
lier in this chapter.)

Surprisingly, most books that focus on real estate investing neglect REITs.
Why? I have come to the conclusion that they do so for three major reasons.
First, if you invest in real estate through REITs, you don’t need to read a long,
complicated book on real estate investment. Second, real estate brokers
write many of these books. Not surprisingly, the real estate investment strate-
gies touted in these books include and advocate the use of such brokers. You
can buy REITs without real estate brokers. Finally, a certain snobbishness
prevails among people who consider themselves to be “serious” real estate
investors. One real estate writer/investor went so far as to say that REITs
aren’t “real” real estate investments.
Please. No, you can’t drive your friends by a REIT and show it off. But those
who put their egos aside when making real estate investments are happy that
they considered REITs and have enjoyed double-digit annual gains over the
decades.
You can research and purchase shares in individual REITs, which trade as
securities on the major stock exchanges (see Chapter 8 for more informa-
tion). An even better approach is to buy a mutual fund that invests in a diver-
sified mixture of REITs (see Chapter 8).
In addition to providing you with a diversified, low-hassle real estate invest-
ment, REITs offer an additional advantage that traditional rental real estate
doesn’t: You can easily invest in REITs through a retirement account (for
example, IRA or Keogh). As with traditional real estate investments, you can
even buy REITs and mutual fund REITs with borrowed money. You can buy
with 50 percent down when you purchase such investments through a bro-
kerage account. (You can only buy with 50 percent down, called buying on
margin, through a non-retirement account.)
Evaluating Advanced (Direct) Real
Estate Investment Options
Every year Forbes magazine publishes a special issue that profiles the 400
wealthiest Americans, known as the Forbes 400. Forbes leaves out mobsters
and drug kingpins. To get on the list, you must make the money through
seemingly legitimate and legal channels. Numerous people made the most
recent list primarily because of their real estate investments. For others 
on the list, real estate was an important secondary factor that contributed 
to their wealth.
Consider the case of Thomas Flatley. An Irish immigrant, he was practically
broke when he came to America in 1950 at age 18. After dabbling in his own
small business, he got into real estate development. Today he owns thousands
of apartments, more than a dozen hotels, and millions of square feet of office
226
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

and retail space, and his net worth is more than $1 billion. That’s a lot of
property and tenants to manage!
If you think you’re cut out to be a landlord and are ready for the responsibil-
ity of buying, owning, and managing rental real estate, you have literally mil-
lions of direct real estate investment options from which to choose.
Before you begin this potentially treacherous journey, I strongly recommend
that you read Chapter 10. Many concepts that you need to know to be a suc-
cessful real estate investor are similar to those that you need when you buy a
home. The rest of this chapter focuses on issues that are more unique to real
estate investing.
Ideally, you should plan to make real estate investments that you hold until,
and perhaps through, your retirement years, although some investors prefer
to buy properties, improve them, and then move on. But what should you
buy? The following is my take on various real estate investments.
Residential housing
Your best bet for real estate investing is to purchase residential property.
People always need a place to live. Residential housing is easier to under-
stand, purchase, and manage than most other types of property, such as
office and retail property. If you’re a homeowner, you already have experi-
ence locating, purchasing, and maintaining residential property.
The most common residential housing options are single-family homes, con-
dominiums, and townhouses. You can also purchase multiunit buildings. In
addition to the considerations that I address in Chapter 10, from an invest-
ment and rental perspective, consider the following issues when you decide
what type of property to buy:
 Tenants: Single-family homes with just one tenant (could be a family, a
couple, or a single person) are simpler to deal with than a multiunit
apartment building that requires the management and maintenance of
multiple renters and units.
 Maintenance: From the property owner’s perspective, condominiums
are generally the lowest-maintenance properties because most condo-
minium associations deal with issues such as roofing, gardening, and so
on for the entire building. Note that as the owner, you’re still responsible
for maintenance that is needed inside your unit, such as servicing appli-
ances, interior painting, and so on. Beware, though, that some condo
complexes don’t allow rentals.
With a single-family home or apartment building, you’re responsible for all
the maintenance. Of course, you can hire someone to do the work, but you
still have to find the contractors and coordinate and oversee the work.
227
Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate

 Appreciation potential: Look for property where simple cosmetic and
other fixes may allow you to increase rents. Such improvements can
increase the market value of the property. Although condos may be
easier on the unit owner to maintain, they tend to appreciate less than
homes or apartment buildings, unless the condos are located in a desir-
able urban area. One way to add value to some larger properties is to
“condo-ize” them. In some areas, if zoning allows, you can convert a
single-family home or multiunit apartment building into condominiums.
Keep in mind, however, that this metamorphosis requires significant
research, both on the zoning front as well as with estimating remodeling
and construction costs.
 Cash flow: As I discuss in the “Cash flow” section later in the chapter,
your rental property brings in rental income that you hope covers and
exceeds your expenses. The difference between the rental income that
you collect and the expenses that you pay out is known as your cash flow.
Unless you can afford a large down payment (25 percent or more), the
early years of rental property ownership may financially challenge you.
Making a profit in the early years from the monthly cash flow with a single-
family home is hard because such properties usually sell at a premium
price relative to the rent that they can command. Remember, you pay
extra for the land, which you can’t rent. Also, the downside to having just
one tenant is that when you have a vacancy, you have no rental income.
Apartment buildings, particularly those with more units, can generally
produce a small positive cash flow, even in the early years of rental own-
ership. With all properties, as time goes on, generating a positive cash
flow gets easier as you pay down your mortgage debt and hopefully
increase your rents.
Unless you really want to minimize maintenance responsibilities, avoid con-
dominium investments. Single-family home investments are generally more
straightforward for most people. Just make sure that you run the numbers (I
show you how in the “Catching on to cash flow” section, later in this chapter)
on your rental income and expenses to see whether you can afford the nega-
tive cash flow that often occurs in the early years of ownership. Apartment
building investments are best left to sophisticated investors who like a chal-
lenge and can manage more complex properties. As I discuss in Chapter 12,
do thorough inspections before you buy any rental property.
Land
If tenants are a hassle and maintaining a building is a never-ending pain, why
not invest in land? Buy land in an area that will soon experience a building
boom, hold onto it until prices soar, and then cash in. Such an investment
idea sounds good in theory. In practice, however, making the big bucks
through land investments isn’t easy. Although land doesn’t require upkeep
and tenants, it does require financial feeding.
228
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

Investing in land is a cash drain, and because it costs money to purchase
land, you also have a mortgage payment to make. Mortgage lenders charge
higher interest rates on loans to purchase land because they see it as a more
speculative investment. You don’t get depreciation tax write-offs because
land isn’t depreciable. You also have property tax payments to meet, as well
as other expenses. However, with land investments, you don’t receive income
from the property to offset these expenses.
If you decide that you someday want to develop the property, that will also
cost you a hefty chunk of money. Obtaining a loan for development is chal-
lenging and more expensive (because it’s riskier for the lender) than obtain-
ing a loan for a developed property.
Identifying many years in advance which communities will experience rapid
population and job growth isn’t easy. Land in those areas that people believe
will be the next hot spot already sells at a premium price. If property growth
doesn’t meet expectations, appreciation will be low or nonexistent.
If you decide to invest in land, be sure that you:
 Can afford it: Tally up the annual carrying costs so that you can see what
your cash drain may be. What are the financial consequences of this
cash outflow? For example, will you be able to fund your tax-advantaged
retirement accounts? If you can’t, count the lost tax benefits as another
cost of owning land.
 Understand what further improvements the land needs: Running util-
ity lines, building roads, landscaping, and so on all cost money. If you
plan to develop and build on the land that you purchase, research what
these things may cost. Make sure that you don’t make these estimates
with your rose-tinted sunglasses on — improvements almost always
cost more than you expect.
 Know its zoning status: The value of land is heavily dependent upon
what you can develop on it. Never, ever purchase land without thor-
oughly understanding its zoning status and what you can and can’t build
on it. Also research the disposition of the planning department and
nearby communities. Areas that are antigrowth and antidevelopment are
less likely to be good places for you to invest in land, especially if you
need permission to do the type of project that you have in mind. Beware
that zoning can change for the worse — sometimes a zoning alteration
can reduce what you can develop on a property and, consequently, the
property’s value.
 Become familiar with the local economic and housing situations: In
the best of all worlds, you want to buy land in an area that is home to
rapidly expanding companies and that has a shortage of housing and
developable land. I discuss how to research these issues in the upcom-
ing section “Deciding Where and What to Buy.”
229
Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate

Commercial real estate
Ever thought about owning and renting out a small office building or strip
mall? If you’re really motivated and willing to roll up your sleeves, you may
want to consider commercial real estate investments. Generally, you’re better
off not investing in such real estate because it’s much more complicated than
investing in residential real estate. It’s also riskier from an investment and
tenant-turnover perspective. When tenants move out, new tenants sometimes
require extensive and costly improvements, which you’ll likely need to pro-
vide to compete with other building owners.
If you’re a knowledgeable real estate investor and you like a challenge, there
are two good reasons to invest in commercial real estate:
 If your analysis of the local market suggests that it’s a good time to buy
 If you can use some of the space to run your own small business
Just as owning your home is generally more cost-effective than renting over
the years, so it is with commercial real estate if — and this is a big if — you
buy at a reasonably good time and hold the property for many years.
So how do you evaluate the state of your local commercial real estate
market? Examine the supply-and-demand statistics over recent years. How
much space is available for rent, and how has that changed over time? What
is the vacancy rate, and how has that changed in recent years? Also investi-
gate the rental rates, usually quoted as a price per square foot. See the sec-
tion “Deciding Where and What to Buy,” later in this chapter, to find out how
to gather this kind of information.
One way to tell that purchasing a commercial property in an area is a bad
idea is a market where the supply of available space has increased faster
than demand, leading to falling rental rates and higher vacancies. A slowing
local economy and a higher unemployment rate also spell trouble for com-
mercial real estate prices. Each market is different, so make sure that you
check out the details of your area. In the next section, I explain where you
can find such information.
Deciding Where and What to Buy
If you’re going to invest in real estate, you can do tons of research to decide
where and what to buy. Keep in mind, though, that as in other aspects of life,
you can spend the rest of your life looking for the perfect real estate invest-
ment, never find it, never invest, and miss out on lots of opportunities, profit,
and even fun. In the following sections, I explain what to look for in a commu-
nity and area that you seek to invest in.
230
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

I’m not suggesting that you need to conduct a nationwide search for the best
areas. In fact, investing in real estate closer to home is best because you’re
probably more familiar with the local area and you should have an easier
time researching and managing local property.
Considering economic issues
People need a place to live, but an area doesn’t generally attract homebuyers
if no jobs exist. Ideally, look to invest in real estate in communities that main-
tain diverse job bases. If the local economy is heavily reliant on jobs in a
small number of industries, that dependence increases the risk of your real
estate investments. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles this data for
metropolitan areas and counties. A good local library should have this data.
You can also visit the bureau’s Web site at www.bls.gov.
Also, consider which industries are more heavily represented in the local
economy. If most of the jobs come from slow-growing or shrinking employ-
ment sectors, real estate prices are unlikely to rise quickly in the years
ahead. On the other hand, areas with a greater preponderance of high-growth
industries stand a greater chance of faster price appreciation.
Also, check out the unemployment situation and examine how the jobless
rate has changed in recent years. Good signs to look for are declining unem-
ployment and increasing job growth. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also
tracks this data.
Evaluating the real estate market
The price of real estate, like the price of anything else, is driven by supply
and demand. The smaller the supply and the greater the demand, the higher
prices climb. Some real estate investors find out this fact the hard way. One
such investor (John Reed, who also writes about real estate) lost all the
money he had made in 15 years of apartment investing as a result of owning
apartments in Texas when the overbuilding occurred in the mid-1980s.
Ouch! Imagine investing for 15 years and then losing it all! Credit was loose in
some areas during the 1980s, which led to a building boom. But in many parts
of Texas, as in some other parts of the country, a ton of buildable land
existed. This abundance of land and available credit inevitably led to over-
building. When the supply of anything expands at a much faster rate than
demand, prices usually fall.
Upward pressure on real estate prices tends to be greatest in areas with little
buildable land. This characteristic was one of the things that attracted me to
real estate in the San Francisco Bay Area when I moved there in the mid-1980s.
If you look at a map of this area, you can see that the city of San Francisco
231
Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate

and the communities to the south are on a peninsula. Ocean, bay inlets, and
mountains bound the rest of the Bay Area. More than 80 percent of the land
in the greater Bay Area isn’t available for development because state and fed-
eral government parks, preserves, and other areas protect the land from
development or the land is impossible to develop. Of the land available for
development, about 98 percent of it in San Francisco, and two-thirds of the
land in nearby counties, had already been developed.
In the long term, the lack of buildable land in an area can be a problem. Real
estate prices that are too high may cause employers and employees to relo-
cate to less expensive areas. If you want to invest in real estate in an area with
little buildable land and sky-high prices, run the numbers to see whether the
deal makes economic sense. (I explain how to do this later in this chapter.)
In addition to buildable land, consider these other important real estate market
indicators to get a sense of the health, or lack thereof, of a particular market:
 Building permits: The trend in the number of building permits tells you
how the supply of real estate properties may soon change. A long and
sustained rise in permits over several years can indicate that the supply
of new property may dampen future price appreciation.
 Vacancy rates: If few rentals are vacant, that means more competition
and demand for existing units, which bodes well for future real estate
price appreciation. Conversely, high vacancy rates indicate an excess
supply of real estate, which may put downward pressure on rental rates
as many landlords compete to attract tenants.
 Listings of property for sale and number of sales: Just as the building
of many new buildings is bad for future real estate price appreciation,
increasing numbers of property listings are also an indication of poten-
tial future trouble. As property prices reach high levels, some investors
decide that they can make more money cashing in and investing else-
where. When the market is flooded with listings, prospective buyers can
be choosier, exerting downward pressure on prices. At high prices (rela-
tive to the cost of renting), more prospective buyers elect to rent, and
the number of sales relative to listings drops.
A sign of a healthy real estate market is a decreasing and low level of
property listings, indicating that the demand from buyers meets or
exceeds the supply of property for sale from sellers. When the cost of
buying is relatively low compared with the cost of renting, more renters
can afford and choose to purchase, thus increasing the number of sales.
 Rents: The trend in rental rates that renters are willing and able to pay
over the years gives a good indication as to the demand for housing.
When the demand for housing keeps up with the supply of housing and
the local economy continues to grow, rents generally increase. This
increase is a positive sign for continued real estate price appreciation.
Beware of buying rental property subject to rent control — the prop-
erty’s expenses may rise faster than you can raise the rents.
232

Examining property valuation 
and financial projections
How do you know what a property is really worth? Some say it’s worth what a
ready, willing, and financially able buyer is willing to pay. But some buyers
pay more than what a property is truly worth. And sometimes buyers who
are patient, do their homework, and bargain hard are able to buy property for
less than its fair market value.
Crunching some numbers to figure what revenue and expenses a rental 
property may bring is one of the most important exercises that you can go
through when you determine a property’s worth and decide whether you
should buy it. In the sections that follow, I walk you through these important
calculations.
Catching on to cash flow
Cash flow is the difference between the money that a property brings in
minus what goes out for its expenses. If you pay so much for a property that
its expenses (including the mortgage payment and property taxes) consis-
tently exceed its income, you have a money drain on your hands. Maybe you
have the financial reserves to withstand the temporary drain for the first few
years, but you need to know upfront what you’re getting yourself into.

Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate
Refuting the wisdom of buying in the “best” areas
Some people, particularly those in the real estate
business, say, “Buy real estate in the best school
districts” or “Buy the least expensive home in
the best neighborhood.” Conventional wisdom is
often wrong, and these examples prove that.
Remember that as a real estate investor, you
hope to profit from someday selling your prop-
erties, many years in the future, for a much
higher price than you purchased them. If you
buy into the “best,” there may not be as much
room for growth.
Take school districts, for example. Conventional
wisdom says that you should look at the test
scores of different districts and buy real estate
in the best (that is, highest-score) districts. But
odds are that real estate in those areas is prob-
ably already priced at a premium level. If things
deteriorate, such an area may experience more
decline than an area where property buyers
haven’t bid prices up into the stratosphere.
The biggest appreciation often comes from
those areas and properties that benefit the most
from improvement. Identifying these in advance
isn’t easy, but look for communities where the
trend in recent years has been positive. Even
some “average” areas perform better in terms
of property value appreciation than today’s
“best” areas.

One of the biggest mistakes that novice rental property investors make is in
failing to realize all the costs associated with investment property. In the worst
cases, some investors end up in personal bankruptcy from the drain of negative
cash flow (expenses exceeding income). In other cases, I’ve seen negative cash
flow hamper people’s ability to accomplish important financial goals.
The second biggest mistake rental property investors make is in believing the
financial statements that sellers and their real estate agents prepare. Just as
an employer views a resume, you should always view such financial state-
ments as advertisements rather than sources of objective information. In
some cases, sellers and agents lie. In most cases, these statements contain
lots of projections and best-case scenarios.
For property that you’re considering purchasing, ask for a copy of Schedule E
(Supplemental Income and Losses) from the property seller’s federal income
tax return. When most people complete their tax returns, they try to mini-
mize their revenue and maximize their expenses — the opposite of what they
and their agents normally do on the statements they sometimes compile to
hype the property sale. Confidentiality and privacy aren’t an issue when you
ask for Schedule E because you’re asking only for this one schedule and not
the person’s entire income tax return. (If the seller owns more than one rental
property for which financial data is compiled on Schedule E, he can simply
black out this other information if he doesn’t want you to see it.)
You should prepare financial statements based on facts and a realistic assess-
ment of a property (see Figures 11-1, 11-2, and 11-3). There’s a time and a
place for unbridled optimism and positive thinking, such as when you’re lost
in a major snowstorm. If you think pessimistically, you may not make it out
alive! But deciding whether to buy a rental property is not a life-or-death situ-
ation. Take your time and do it with your eyes and ears open and with a
healthy degree of skepticism.
The monthly rental property financial statement that you prepare in Figures 11-1
thorough 11-3 is for the present. Over time, you hope and expect that your
rental income will increase faster than the property’s expenses, thus increas-
ing the cash flow. If you want, you can use this financial statement for future
years’ projections as well.

Ask for copies of current lease agreements and also check
comparable unit rental rates in the local market. Ask if the owner
made any
(such as a month or two of free rent), which
may make rental rates appear inflated. Make your offer contingent on
the accuracy of the rental rates.

estimate by 12!
Finding good tenants
takes time and promotion. If you list your rental through rental
brokers, they normally take one month’s rent as their cut. Owners of
larger buildings sometimes have an on-site manager to show vacant
units and deal with maintenance and repairs. Put the monthly pay for
that person on this line or the preceding line. If you provide a below-

this into the rental income section.

Valuing property
Examining and estimating a property’s cash flow is an important first step to
deciding a property’s value. But on its own, a building’s cash flow doesn’t
provide enough information to intelligently decide whether to buy a particu-
lar real estate investment. Just because a property has a positive cash flow
doesn’t mean that you should buy it. Real estate generally sells for less and
may have better cash flow in areas that investors expect to earn lower rates
of appreciation.
In the stock market, you have more clues about a specific security’s worth.
Most companies’ stocks trade on a daily basis, so you at least have a recent
sales price to start with. Of course, just because a stock recently traded at
$20 per share doesn’t mean that it’s worth $20 per share. Investors may be
overly optimistic or pessimistic.
Just as you should compare a stock to other comparable stocks, so too
should you compare the asking price of a property with other comparable
real estate. But what if all real estate is overvalued? Such a comparison doesn’t
necessarily reveal the state of inflated prices. In addition to comparing a real
estate investment property to comparable properties, you need to also per-
form some global evaluations of whether prices from a historic perspective
appear too high, too low, or just right. To answer this last question, see
Chapter 10.

The tax law allows you to claim a yearly tax deduction
for depreciation, but remember that you can’t depreciate land. Break
down the purchase of your rental property between the building and
land. You can make this allocation based on the assessed value for
the land and the building or on a real estate appraisal. Residential
property is depreciated over 27½ years (3.64 percent of the building
value per year), and nonresidential property is depreciated over 39
years (2.56 percent of the building value per year). For example, if
you buy a residential rental property for $300,000 and $200,000 of
that is allocated to the building, that means that you can take
$7,273 per year as a depreciation tax deduction ($200,000 x .0364).

:  Although depreciation is a deduction that helps you reduce your profit for tax
purposes, it doesn’t actually cost you money. Your cash flow from a rental property is the revenue minus
your out-of-pocket expenses.

Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate

To value a piece of property, you can try one of three following approaches.
Here are the pros and cons of the different approaches that you can use to
value property:
 Appraisers: The biggest advantage of hiring an appraiser is that she
values property for a living. An appraisal also gives you some hard num-
bers to use for negotiating with a seller. Hire an appraiser who works at
it full time and has experience valuing the type of property that you’re
considering. Ask for examples of a dozen similar properties in the area
that she has appraised in the past three months.
The drawback of appraisers is that they cost money. A small home may
cost several hundred dollars to appraise, and a larger multiunit building
may cost $1,000 or more. The danger is that you can spend money on an
appraisal for a building that you don’t end up buying.
 Real estate agents: If you work with a good real estate agent (I discuss
how to find one in Chapter 12), ask him to draw up a list of comparable
properties and help you estimate the value of the property that you’re
considering buying. The advantage of having your agent help with this
analysis is that you don’t pay extra for this service.
The drawback of asking an agent what to pay for a property is that his com-
mission depends on your buying a property and on the amount that you
pay for that property. The more you’re willing to pay for a property, the
more likely the deal flies, and the more the agent makes on commission.
 Do-it-yourself: If you’re comfortable with numbers and analysis, you can
try to estimate the value of a property yourself. The hard part is identify-
ing comparable properties. It’s usually impossible to find identical prop-
erties, so you need to find similar properties and then make adjustments
to their selling price so that you can do an apples-to-apples comparison.
Among the factors that should influence your analysis of comparable
properties are the date the properties sold; the quality of their location;
lot size; building age and condition; the number of units; the number of
rooms, bedrooms, and bathrooms; garages; fireplaces; and yard. A real
estate agent can provide this information, or you can track it down for
properties that you’ve seen or that you know have recently sold.
For example, if a similar property sold six months ago for $250,000 but
prices overall have increased 5 percent in the last six months, add 5 per-
cent from the sales price. Ultimately, you have to attach a value or price
to each difference between comparable properties and the one that
you’re considering buying. Through a series of adjustments, you can
then compare the value of your target property to others that have
recently sold.
These approaches aren’t mutually exclusive — you probably want to at least
review the numbers and analysis that an appraiser or real estate agent puts
together.
238
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

Finding the information you need
When you evaluate properties, you need to put on your detective hat. If
you’re creative and inquisitive, you soon realize that this isn’t a hard game to
play. You can collect useful information about a property and the area in
which it’s located in many ways.
The first place to begin your inquiries is with the real estate agent who listed
the property for sale. One thing that most agents love to do is talk and
schmooze. Try to understand why the seller is selling. This knowledge helps
you negotiate an offer that’s appealing to the seller.
As for specifics on the property’s financial situation, as I explain earlier in
this chapter, ask the sellers for specific independent documents, including
Schedule E from their tax return. Hire inspectors to investigate the property’s
physical condition (I advise you on hiring inspectors in Chapter 12).
Local government organizations can be treasure troves of information about
their communities. You can also see the other recommended sources in
Chapter 10, as well as some other sources that I suggest earlier in this chapter.
Digging for a Good Deal
Everyone likes to get a deal or feel like they bought something at a really
good price. How else can you explain the American retail practice of sales?
Merchandise is first overpriced, and what doesn’t sell quickly enough is then
marked down to create the illusion that you’re getting a bargain! Some real
estate sellers and agents do the same thing. They list property for sale at an
inflated price and then mark it down after they realize that no one will pay
their asking price. “$30,000 price reduction!” the new listing screams. Of
course, this reduction isn’t a deal.
Purchasing a piece of real estate at a discount is possible. Without doing a lick
of work, you can make money simply by purchasing a property at a discount —
one of the ultimate thrills of capitalism!
Scores of books claim to have the real estate investment strategy that can
beat the system. Often these promoters claim that you can become a multi-
millionaire through investing in distressed properties. A common strategy is
to purchase property that a seller has defaulted on or is about to default on.
Or how about buying a property in someone’s estate through probate court?
Maybe you’d like to try your hand at investing in a property that has been
condemned or has toxic-waste contamination!
239
Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate

It is possible to get a good buy and purchase a problem property at a discount
larger than the cost of fixing the property. However, these opportunities are
hard to find, and sellers of such properties are often unwilling to sell at a dis-
count that’s big enough to leave you much room for profit. If you don’t know
how to thoroughly and correctly evaluate the problems of the property, you
can end up overpaying.
In some cases, the strategies that these real estate gurus advocate involve
taking advantage of people’s lack of knowledge. For example, some people
don’t know that they can protect the equity in their home through filing per-
sonal bankruptcy. If you can find a seller in such dire financial straits and des-
perate for cash, you may get a bargain buy on the home. (You may struggle
with the moral issues of buying property cheaply this way.)
Other methods of finding discounted property take lots of time and digging.
Some involve cold-calling property owners to see whether they’re interested
in selling. This method is a little bit like trying to fill a job opening by inter-
viewing people you run into on a street corner. Although you may eventually
find a good candidate this way, if you factor in the value of your time, the deal
seems like less of a bargain.
Without making things complicated or too risky, you can use some of the fol-
lowing time-tested and proven ways to buy real estate at a discount to its fair
market value:
 Find a motivated seller: Be patient and look at lots of properties, and
sooner or later you’ll come across one that someone needs to sell (and
these aren’t necessarily the ones advertised as having a motivated
seller). Perhaps the seller has bought another property and needs the
money to close on the recent purchase. Having access to sufficient
financing can help secure such deals.
 Buy unwanted properties with fixable flaws: The easiest problems to
correct are cosmetic. Some sellers and their agents are lazy and don’t
even bother to clean a property. One single-family home that I bought had
probably three years’ worth of cobwebs and dust accumulated. It seemed
like a dungeon at night because half the light bulbs were burned out.
Painting, tearing up old, ugly carpeting, refinishing hardwood floors, and
putting new plantings in a yard are relatively easy jobs. They make the
property worth more and make renters willing to pay higher rent. Of
course, these tasks take money and time, and many buyers aren’t inter-
ested in dealing with problems. If you have an eye for improving prop-
erty and are willing to invest the time that coordinating the fix-up work
requires, go for it! Just make sure that you hire someone to conduct a
thorough property inspection before you buy. (See Chapter 12 for more
details.)
240
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

Be sure to factor in the loss of rental income if you can’t rent a portion of
the property during the fix-up period. Some investors have gone belly up
from the double cash drain of fix-up expenses and lost rents.
 Buy when the real estate market is depressed: When the economy
takes a few knocks and investors rush for the exits, it’s time to go shop-
ping! Buy real estate when prices and investor interest are down. During
times of depressed markets, obtaining properties that produce a posi-
tive cash flow (even in the early years) is easier. In Chapter 10, I explain
how to spot a depressed market.
 Check for zoning opportunities: Sometimes, you can make more pro-
ductive use of a property. For example, you can legally convert some
multiunit apartment buildings into condominiums. Some single-family
residences may include a rental unit if local zoning allows for it. A good
real estate agent, contractor, and the local planning office in the town or
city where you’re looking at the property can help you identify proper-
ties that you can convert. If you’re not a proponent of development, then
you probably won’t like this strategy.
If you buy good real estate and hold it for the long term, you can earn a
healthy return from your investment. Over the long haul, having bought a
property at a discount becomes an insignificant issue. You make money from
your real estate investments as the market appreciates and as a result of your
ability to manage your property well. So don’t obsess over buying property
at a discount and don’t wait for the perfect deal, because it won’t come along.
Recognizing Inferior Real 
Estate “Investments”
Some supposedly “simple” ways to invest in real estate rarely make sense
because they’re near-certain money losers. In this section, I discuss real
estate investments that you should generally (but not always) avoid.
Time shares
Time shares are near-certain money losers. With a time share, you buy a week
or two of ownership or usage of a particular unit, usually a condominium, in 
a resort location. If you pay $8,000 for a week of “ownership,” you pay the
equivalent of more than $400,000 a year for the whole unit ($8,000/week × 52
weeks). However, a comparable unit nearby may sell for only $150,000. The
241
Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate

extra markup pays the salespeople’s commissions, administrative expenses,
and profits for the time-share development company. (This little analysis also
ignores the not-so-inconsequential ongoing time-share maintenance fees, which
can easily run $200 per year or more.) People usually get hoodwinked into
buying a time share when they’re enjoying a vacation someplace. Vacationers
are easy prey for salespeople who, often using high-pressure sales tactics, want
to sell them a souvenir of the trip. The cheese in the mousetrap is an offer of
something free (for example, a free night’s stay in a unit) for going through the
sales presentation.
The time-share concept, unfortunately, was imported into the United States
in the early 1970s and has stuck ever since. Even large and otherwise rep-
utable companies, such as Disney, Marriott, and Hilton, have moved into this
business in recent years. It’s a good business for them — selling lousy time-
share investments to the public — but now you won’t become one more of
their victims!
If you can’t live without a time share, consider buying a used one. Many pre-
vious buyers, who almost always have lost much of their original investment,
try to dump their time shares. This fact tells you something about time
242
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Second/vacation homes
A sometimes idyllic notion and expanded part of
the American dream is the weekend cottage or
condo — a place that you can retreat to when
crowded urban or suburban living conditions get
on your nerves. When it’s not in use, you may rent
out your vacation home and earn some income
to help defray part of the maintenance expenses.
If you can realistically afford the additional
costs of a second, or vacation, home, I’m not
going to tell you how to spend your extra cash.
Investment real estate is property that you rent
out 90 percent or more of the time. Most
second-home owners whom I know rent their
property out very little — 10 percent or less of
the time. As a result, second homes are usually
money drains. Even if you do rent your second
home most of the time, high tenant turnover
decreases your net rental income.
Now, I have seen some people make a decent
return with second homes that were infrequently
rented. Usually, these homes are held over
many years and located in areas that have
become increasingly popular.
Part of the allure of a second home is the sup-
posed tax benefits. Even when you qualify for
some or all of them, tax benefits only partially
reduce the cost of owning a property. I’ve seen
more than a few cases in which the second
home is such a cash drain that it prevents its
owners from contributing to and taking advan-
tage of tax-deductible retirement savings plans.
If you don’t rent out a second home property
most of the time, ask yourself whether you 
can afford such a luxury. Can you accomplish
your other financial goals — saving for retire-
ment, paying for the home in which you live, and
so on — with this added expense? Keeping a
second home is more of a consumption than an
investment decision.

shares. You may be able to buy a time share from an existing owner at a fair
price, but why commit yourself to taking a vacation in the same location and
building at the same time each year? Many time shares let you trade your
weeks; however, doing so is a hassle, and you’re limited by what time slots
you can trade for, which are typically dates that other people don’t want. Most
of these open time slots are undesirable — that’s why people trade them!
Limited partnerships
In Chapter 1, I give you good reasons to avoid limited partnerships. High
sales commissions and ongoing management fees burden limited partner-
ships sold through stockbrokers and financial planners who work on commis-
sion. Quality real estate investment trusts (REITs), which I discuss earlier in
this chapter, are infinitely better alternatives. REITs, unlike limited partner-
ships, are also completely liquid.
Scams
Wanting to make a lot of money in a hurry is very American. Real estate
investors with lofty expectations for high returns become bait for various
hucksters who promise these investors great riches. It’s bad enough when
the deck is stacked against you. Even worse is to put your money into scams.
First Pension, for example, was an outfit run by loan broker William Cooper
that bilked investors out of more than $100 million. First Pension was sold as
a limited partnership that invested in mortgages. Using a Ponzi-type (pyra-
mid) scheme, Cooper used the money from new investors to pay dividends to
earlier investors. Time shares, a truly terrible investment that I discuss in
this chapter, have also been subject to bankruptcy and fraud problems.
Hundreds of thousands of viewers fall prey annually to infomercial hucksters.
Among the more infamous real estate infomercial promoters is Tom Vu. At his
seminars, according to The Los Angeles Times, he says, “Well, if you make no
money with me, you a loser.” Vu, who came to the United States from Vietnam
in the mid-1970s, claims to have made a fortune investing in real estate by
using a fairly simple system. He says that he searches for property owners
who are in debt up to their eyeballs and offers to buy their properties with no
money down. By finding desperate sellers, he says, you can buy real estate at
a big discount from its fair market value.
Vu actually makes his money from running high-priced seminars to teach you
basic real estate techniques that you can read in a book that costs about $20.
Vu, however, charges up to $15,000 for a five-day seminar! As if overpaying
this much isn’t enough, Vu’s former “students,” who have filed a number of
243
Chapter 11: Investing in Real Estate

lawsuits that include a class action suit, say that his methods don’t work and
that he reneged on his promises to go into partnership on properties that
they identified. A number of states have investigated and are currently inves-
tigating Vu’s practices, have barred further Vu seminars in their state, and are
seeking compensation for victims. Unfortunately, Vu appears to have moved
much of his money overseas. Other real estate seminar hucksters such as
Robert Allen and Ed Buckley saw their seminar enterprises end up in bank-
ruptcy, sunk by the claims of their unhappy students.
Other scams also abound. Stephen Murphy was a real estate investor who
claimed to make a fortune by buying foreclosed commercial real estate and
wrote and self-published a book to share his techniques with the public.
Murphy’s organization called the people who bought his book and pitched
them into collaborating with him on property purchases that supposedly
would return upwards of 100 percent or more per year. However, Murphy had
other ideas, and he siphoned off nearly two-thirds of the money for himself
and for promotion of his books! He even hoodwinked Donald Trump into writ-
ing praise for his book and work: “I really admire Steve Murphy. . . . Steve
commands some very wise, intelligent . . . and unique purchasing strategies.”
I’ll say!
New York attorney Alan Harris also defrauded real estate investors (including
actress Shirley Jones) out of millions of dollars when he pocketed money that
was set aside for property investments. The lure: Harris promised investors
far higher yields than they could get elsewhere.
If an investment “opportunity” sounds too good to be true, it is. If you want
to invest in real estate, avoid the hucksters and invest directly in properties
that you can control or invest through reputable REITs (or REIT mutual funds).

I
n this chapter, I discuss issues such as understanding and selecting mort-
gages, working with real estate agents, negotiating, and other important
details that help you actually put a real estate deal together. I also provide
some words of wisdom about taxes and selling your property that may come
in handy down the road. (In Chapter 10, I cover what you need to know to
purchase a home, and in Chapter 11, I review the fundamentals of investing
in real estate.)
Working with Real Estate Agents
When you purchase real estate, if you’re like most people, you enlist the serv-
ices of a real estate agent. A good agent can help screen property so that you
don’t spend all your free time looking at potential properties to buy, negotiat-
ing a deal, helping coordinate inspections, and managing other preclosing items.
Recognizing agent conflicts of interest
All real estate agents, good, mediocre, and awful, are subject to a conflict of
interest because of the way they’re compensated — on commission. I must
say that I respect real estate agents for calling themselves what they are. Real

estate agents don’t hide behind an obscure job title, such as “shelter consul-
tant.” (Many financial “planners,” “advisors,” or “consultants,” for example,
actually work on commission and sell investments and life insurance and,
therefore, are really stockbrokers and insurance brokers, not planners or
advisors.)
Real estate agents aren’t in the business of providing objective financial coun-
sel. Just as car dealers make their living selling cars, real estate agents make
their living selling real estate. Never forget this fact as a buyer.
The pursuit of a larger commission may encourage an agent to get you to do
things that aren’t in your best interests, such as the following:
 Buy, and buy sooner rather than later: If you don’t buy, your agent
doesn’t get paid for all the hours she spends working with you. The
worst agents fib and use tricks to motivate you to buy. They may say
that other offers are coming in on a property that interests you, or they
may show you a bunch of dumps and then one good listing to motivate
you to buy the one good listing.
 Spend more than you should: Because real estate agents get a percent-
age of the sales price of a property, they have a built-in incentive to
encourage you to spend more on a property than what fits comfortably
with your other financial objectives and goals. An agent doesn’t have to
consider or care about your other financial needs.
 Purchase their company’s listings: Agents also have a built-in incentive
(higher commission) to sell their own listings.
 Buy in their territory: Real estate agents typically work a specific terri-
tory. As a result, they usually can’t objectively tell you the pros and cons
of the surrounding region.
 Use people who scratch their backs: Some agents refer you to brokers,
lenders, inspectors, and title insurance companies that have referred
customers to them. Some agents also solicit and receive referral fees (or
bribes) from mortgage lenders, inspectors, and contractors to whom
they refer business.
Finding a good agent
A mediocre, incompetent, or greedy agent can be a real danger to your
finances. Whether you’re hiring an agent to work with you as a buyer or
seller, you want someone who is competent and with whom you can get
along. Working with an agent costs a good deal of money, so make sure that
you get your money’s worth.
246
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

Interview several agents. Check references. Ask agents for the names and
phone numbers of at least three clients with whom they’ve worked in the
past six months in the geographical area in which you’re looking. By narrow-
ing the period during which they worked with references to six months, you
maximize the chances of speaking with clients other than the agent’s all-time-
favorite clients.
As you speak with an agent’s references, look for these traits in any agent
that you work with, whether as a buyer or seller:
 Full-time employment: Some agents work in real estate as a second or
even third job. Information in this field changes constantly — keeping
track of it is hard enough on a full-time basis. It’s hard to imagine a
good agent being able to stay on top of the market while moonlighting
elsewhere.
 Experience: Hiring someone with experience doesn’t necessarily mean
looking for an agent who’s been around for decades. Many of the best
agents come into the field from other occupations, such as business and
teaching. Agents can acquire some sales, marketing, negotiation, and com-
munication skills in other fields, but experience in real estate does count.
 Honesty and integrity: You need to trust your agent with a lot of infor-
mation. If the agent doesn’t level with you about what a neighborhood or
particular property is really like, you suffer the consequences.
 Interpersonal skills: An agent must get along not only with you but also
with a whole host of other people who are involved in a typical real
estate deal: other agents, property sellers, inspectors, mortgage lenders,
and so on. An agent needs to know how to put your interests first with-
out upsetting others.
 Negotiation skills: Putting a real estate deal together involves negotia-
tion. Is your agent going to exhaust all avenues to get you the best deal
possible? Most people don’t like the sometimes aggravating process of
negotiation, so they hire someone else to do it for them. Be sure to ask
the agent’s former client references how the agent negotiated for them.
 High quality standards: Sloppy work can lead to big legal or logistical
problems down the road. If an agent neglects to recommend an inspec-
tion, for example, you may get stuck with undiscovered problems after
the deal is done.
Some agents who pitch themselves as buyer’s brokers claim that they work
for your interests. Agents who represent you as buyer’s brokers still get paid
only when you buy. And agents still get paid a commission that’s a percentage
of the purchase price. So they still have an incentive to sell you a piece of real
estate that’s more expensive because their commission increases.
247
Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making

Agents sometimes market themselves as top producers, which means that
they sell a relatively larger volume of real estate. This title doesn’t count for
much for you, the buyer. In fact, you may use this information as a potential
red flag for an agent who focuses on completing as many deals as possible.
Such an agent may not be able to give you the time and help that you need to
get the house you want.
When you buy a home, you need an agent who is patient. You need an agent
who allows you the necessary time to educate yourself and helps you make
the decision that’s best for you. The last thing you need or want is an agent
who tries to push you into making a deal.
You also need an agent who is knowledgeable about the local market and
community. If you want to buy a home in an area where you don’t currently
live, an informed agent can have a big impact on your decision.
Finding an agent with financing knowledge is a plus for buyers, especially
first-time buyers or those with credit problems. Such an agent may be able to
refer you to lenders that can handle your type of situation, which can save
you a lot of legwork.
Financing Your Realty Investments
Unless you’re affluent or buying a low-cost property, you likely need to borrow
some money, via a mortgage, to finance your property acquisition. If you can’t
line up financing, your deal may fall apart. If you don’t shop correctly for a
248
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Buying without a real estate agent
You can purchase property without an agent if
you’re willing to do some additional legwork.
You need to do the things that a good real estate
agent does, such as searching for properties,
scheduling appointments to see them, deter-
mining fair market value, negotiating the deal,
and coordinating inspections.
If you don’t work with an agent, have an attor-
ney review the various contracts, unless you’re
a legal expert. Having someone else not vested
in the transaction look out for your interests
helps your situation. Real estate agents gener-
ally aren’t legal experts, so getting legal advice
from an attorney is generally better. (In some
states, you need to hire an attorney in addition
to the real estate agent.)
One possible drawback to working without an
agent is performing the negotiations yourself.
Negotiating can be problematic if you lack
these skills or get too caught up emotionally in
the situation.

good mortgage, you can spend thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands, of
dollars in extra interest and fees. Even worse, you can get saddled with a loan
that you someday can’t afford, and you may end up in bankruptcy.
Comparing fixed-rate to adjustable-rate
mortgages
Two major types of mortgages exist: those with a fixed interest rate and those
with an adjustable rate (known as ARMs, for adjustable-rate mortgages). When
you buy real estate, you have to choose the type of mortgage that best fits your
needs. Your choice depends on your financial situation, how much risk you’re
willing to accept, and the type of property that you want to purchase. For
example, obtaining a fixed-rate loan on a property that lenders perceive as a
riskier investment is more difficult than getting an ARM for the same property.
Locking into fixed-rate mortgages
Fixed-rate mortgages, which are typically for a 15- or 30-year term, have inter-
est rates that stay fixed or level — you lock in an interest rate that doesn’t
change over the life of your loan. Because the interest rate stays the same,
your monthly mortgage payment stays the same. You have nothing compli-
cated to track and no uncertainty. Fixed-rate loans give people peace of mind
and payment stability.
Fixed-rate mortgages do, however, carry risks. If interest rates fall signifi-
cantly after you obtain your mortgage and you’re unable to refinance, you
face the danger of being stuck with a higher-cost mortgage, which could be
disastrous if you ever lose your job or if the value of your property
decreases. Even if you’re able to refinance, you’ll probably have to spend sig-
nificant time and money to complete the paperwork.
Understanding adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)
In contrast to a fixed-rate mortgage, an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) car-
ries an interest rate that varies over time (based upon a formula the lender
uses). Such a mortgage begins with one interest rate, and you may pay differ-
ent rates for every year, possibly even every month, during a 30-year mort-
gage. Thus, the size of your monthly payment fluctuates. Because a mortgage
payment makes an unusually large dent in most property owners’ check-
books, signing up for an ARM without fully understanding it is fiscally foolish.
The advantage of an ARM is that if you purchase your property during a period
of higher interest rates, you can start paying your mortgage with a relatively
low initial interest rate (compared with fixed-rate loans). And if interest rates
decline, you can capture many of the benefits of lower rates without the cost
and hassle of refinancing.

Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making

Choosing between a fixed-rate and
adjustable-rate mortgage
You can’t predict the future course of interest rates. Even the professional
financial market soothsayers and investors can’t predict where rates are
heading. If you could foretell this information, you could make a fortune
investing in bonds and interest-rate futures and options. So cast aside your
crystal ball and ask yourself the following two vital questions to help you
decide whether a fixed or adjustable mortgage will work best for you.
How comfortable are you with taking risk?
How much of a gamble can you take with the size of your monthly mortgage
payment? For example, if your job and income are unstable and you need to
borrow an amount that stretches your monthly budget, you can’t afford
much risk. If you’re in this situation, stick with fixed-rate mortgages.
250
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 
Balloon loans
Balloon loans generally start the way traditional
fixed-rate mortgages start. You make level pay-
ments based on a long-term payment schedule,
over 15 or 30 years, for example. But at a pre-
determined time, usually three to ten years from
the loan’s inception, the remaining loan balance
becomes fully due.
Balloon loans may save you money because
they have a lower interest rate than a longer-
term fixed-rate mortgage and you pay that inter-
est over a shorter period of time. However,
balloon loans are dangerous — your financial
situation can change, and you may not be able
to refinance when your balloon loan is due.
What if you lose your job or your income drops?
What if the value of your property drops and the
appraisal comes in too low to qualify you for a
new loan? What if interest rates rise and you
can’t qualify at the higher rate on a new loan?
You’re still going to have to pay off your balloon
loan when it expires.
Sometimes, balloon loans may be the only option
for the buyer (or so the buyer thinks). Buyers are
more commonly backed into these loans during
periods of high interest rates. When a buyer can’t
afford the payments on a conventional mortgage
and really wants a particular property, a seller
may offer a balloon loan.
I recommend avoiding balloon loans. You should
take a balloon loan if, and only if, such a loan is
your only financing option, you’ve really done
your homework to exhaust other financing alter-
natives, and you’re certain that you can refi-
nance when the balloon comes due. If you take
a balloon loan, get one with as much time as
possible, preferably seven to ten years, before it
becomes due.

If you’re in a position to take the financial risks that come with an adjustable-
rate mortgage, you have a better chance of saving money with an adjustable-
rather than fixed-rate loan. Your interest rate starts lower and stays lower if
the overall level of interest rates stays unchanged. Even if rates go up, they’ll
likely come back down over the life of your loan. If you can stick with your
adjustable-rate loan for better and for worse, you may come out ahead in
the long run.
Adjustables make more sense if you borrow less than you’re qualified for. Or
perhaps you regularly save a sizable chunk — more than 10 percent — of
your monthly income. If your income significantly exceeds your spending,
you may feel less anxiety about fluctuating interest rates. If you do choose
an adjustable loan, you may be more financially secure if you have a hefty
financial cushion (at least six months’ to as much as a year’s worth of
expenses reserved) that you can access if rates go up.
Almost all adjustables limit, or cap, the rise in the interest rate that your loan
allows. Typical caps are 2 percent per year and 6 percent over the life of the
loan. Ask your lender to calculate the highest possible monthly payment that
your loan allows. The number that the lender comes up with is the payment
that you face if the interest rate on your loan goes to the highest level allowed,
or the lifetime cap. If you can’t afford the highest-allowed payment on an
adjustable-rate mortgage, don’t take one. You shouldn’t take the chance that
the rate may not rise that high — it can, and you could lose the property.
Don’t take an adjustable mortgage because the lower initial interest rates allow
you to afford the property that you want to buy (unless you’re absolutely cer-
tain that your income will rise to meet future payment increases). Try setting
your sights on a property that you can afford to buy with a fixed-rate mortgage.
How many years do you expect to stay put?
Saving interest on most adjustables is usually a certainty in the first two or
three years. An adjustable-rate mortgage starts at a lower interest rate than a
fixed-rate mortgage. If rates rise, you can end up giving back the savings that
you achieve in the early years of the mortgage.
If you aren’t going to keep your mortgage for more than five to seven years,
you’ll probably end up paying more interest to carry a fixed-rate mortgage. A
mortgage lender takes extra risk in committing to a fixed-interest rate for 15 to
30 years. To compensate them for accepting this additional risk, lenders charge
you a premium in case interest rates move much higher in future years.
You may also consider a hybrid loan, which combines features of fixed- and
adjustable-rate mortgages. For example, the initial rate may hold constant for
several years and then adjust once a year or every six months thereafter. Such
loans may make sense for you if you foresee a high probability of keeping your
loan seven years or less but want some stability in your monthly payments.
The longer the initial rate stays locked in, the higher the interest rate.
251
Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making

Getting a great fixed-rate mortgage
The interest rate on a fixed-rate loan is the rate that you pay every month
over the entire life of the loan for borrowing the money. You may think that
comparing one fixed-rate loan to another, then, is quite simple. As with your
golf score and the number of times that your boss catches you showing up
late for work, a lower number (interest rate) is better, right?
Unfortunately, banks generally charge an upfront chunk of interest, known as
points, in addition to the ongoing interest over the life of the loan. Points are
actually percentages: One point is equal to 1 percent of the loan amount. So
when a lender tells you a quoted loan has 1.5 points, you pay 1.5 percent of
the amount you borrow as points. On a $100,000 loan, for example, 1.5 points
cost you $1,500. The interest rate on a fixed-rate loan must always be quoted
with the points on the loan, if the loan has points.
You may want to take a higher interest rate on your mortgage if you don’t
have enough cash to pay for a lot of points, which you pay upfront when you
close the loan. On the other hand, if you’re willing and able to pay more
points, you can lower your interest rate. You may want to pay more points
because the interest rate on your loan determines your payments over a long
period of time — 15 to 30 years.
Suppose that one lender quotes you a rate of 6.75 percent on a 30-year fixed-
rate loan and charges one point (1 percent). Another lender, which quotes 7
percent for 30 years, doesn’t charge any points. Which is better? The answer
depends on how long you plan to keep the loan.
The 6.75 percent loan is 0.25 percent less than the 7 percent loan. However, it
takes you about four years to earn back the savings to cover the cost of that
point because you have to pay 1 percent (one point) upfront on the 6.75-percent
loan. So if you expect to keep the loan more than four years, go with the 6.75
percent option. If you plan to keep the loan less than four years, go with the 7
percent option.
To make it easier to perform an apples-to-apples comparison of mortgages
from different lenders, get interest rate quotes at the same point level. For
example, ask each lender for the interest rate on a loan for which you pay
one point.
Never, ever forget that if a loan has no points, it’s sure to have a higher inter-
est rate. That’s not to say that no-point loans are better or worse than compa-
rable loans from other lenders, but don’t get sucked into a loan because of a
no-points sales pitch. Lenders who spend big bucks on advertising these
types of loans rarely have the best mortgage terms.
252
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

All things being equal, no-point loans make more sense for refinances
because points aren’t immediately tax-deductible as they are on purchases.
(You can deduct the points that you pay on a refinance only over the life of
the mortgage.) On a mortgage for a property that you’re purchasing, a no-
point loan may help if you’re cash poor at closing.
Consider a no-point loan if you can’t afford more out-of-pocket expenditures
now or if you think that you’ll keep the loan only a few years. Shop around
and compare different lenders’ no-point loans.
Finding a great adjustable-rate mortgage
Selecting an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) has a lot in common with select-
ing a home to buy. You need to make trade-offs and compromises. In the fol-
lowing sections, I explain the numerous features and options — caps, indexes,
margins, and adjustment periods — that you find with ARMs (these aren’t
issues with fixed-rate loans).
Getting off to a good start rate
Just as the name implies, your start rate is the one that your mortgage begins
with. Think of the start rate as a teaser rate — the initial rate on ARMs is
often set artificially low to entice you. Don’t judge an ARM by this rate alone.
You won’t pay this attractively low rate for long. With ARMs, interest rates
generally rise as soon as the terms of the mortgage allow. Even if the market
level of interest rates doesn’t change, your adjustable is destined to increase.
An increase of one or two percentage points is common.
The formula for determining the future interest rates on an adjustable-rate
mortgage (see the following section) and the rate caps are far more important
in determining what a mortgage is going to cost you in the long run. For more
on rate caps, see the section “Analyzing adjustments,” later in this chapter.
Determining your future interest rate
The first thing that you need to ask a mortgage lender or broker about an
adjustable rate is the formula for determining the future interest rate on your
loan. You need to know exactly how a lender figures how your interest rate
changes over the life of the loan. All adjustables are based on the following
formula, which specifies how the interest rate is set on your loan in the future:
Index + margin = interest rate
The index measures the overall level of interest rates that the lender chooses
in order to calculate the specific interest rate for your loan. Indexes are gen-
erally (but not always) widely quoted in the financial press. For example, 
253
Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making

suppose that the current index value for a given loan is equal to the six-month
Treasury bill index, which is 3 percent. The margin is the amount added to
the index to determine the interest rate that you pay on your mortgage. Most
loans have margins of around 2.5 percent. Thus, the rate of a mortgage driven
by the following formula
Six-month Treasury bill rate + 2.5 percent
is set at 3 + 2.5 = 5.5 percent. This figure is known as the fully indexed rate. If
this loan starts out at just 4 percent, you know that if the index (six-month
Treasuries) stays at the same level, your loan can increase to 5.5 percent.
Compare the fully indexed rate to the current rate for fixed-rate loans. During
particular time periods, you may be surprised to discover that the fixed-rate
loan is at about the same interest rate or even a tad lower. This insight may
cause you to reconsider your choice of an adjustable-rate loan, which can,
of course, rise to an even higher rate in the future.
Understanding common indexes for adjustable-rate mortgages
The different indexes vary mainly in how rapidly they respond to changes in
interest rates. Some common indexes include:
 Treasury bills: T-bills are IOUs (bonds) that the U.S. government issues.
Most adjustables are tied to the interest rate on 6-month or 12-month T-
bills. T-bill interest rates move relatively quickly.
 Certificates of deposit: CDs are interest-bearing bank investments that
lock you in for a specific period of time. ARMs are usually tied to the
average interest rate that banks are paying on six-month CDs. Like T-
bills, CDs tend to respond quickly to changes in the market’s level of
interest rates.
 The 11th District cost of funds: The cost of funds index (COFI) is among
the slower-moving indexes. Adjustable-rate mortgages tied to the 11th
District cost of funds tend to start out at a higher interest rate. A slower-
moving index has the advantage of moving up less quickly when rates
are on the rise. On the other hand, you have to be patient to benefit from
falling interest rates.
If you select an adjustable-rate mortgage that’s tied to one of the faster-
moving indexes, you take on more of a risk that the next adjustment may
reflect interest rate increases. Because you take on more of the risk that
interest rates may increase, lenders cut you breaks in other ways, such as
through lower caps or points.
Should you want the security of an ARM tied to a slower-moving index, you’ll
pay for that security in one form or another, such as a higher start rate, caps,
margin, or points. You may also pay in other, less-obvious ways.
254
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

Trying to predict interest rates is a dangerous game. When selecting a mort-
gage, keeping sight of your own financial situation is far more important than
trying to guess future interest rates.
Analyzing adjustments
After the initial interest rate expires, the interest rate on an ARM fluctuates
based on the loan formula. Most adjustables adjust every 6 or 12 months, but
some may adjust as frequently as monthly. In advance of each adjustment,
the lender sends you a notice telling you your new rate. Be sure to check
these adjustments because lenders sometimes make mistakes.
All things being equal, the less frequently your loan adjusts, the less financial
uncertainty you have in your life. However, less-frequent adjustments usually
mean that your loan starts at a higher interest rate.
Almost all adjustables come with a rate cap, which limits the maximum rate
change (up or down) that each adjustment allows. This limit is usually referred
to as the adjustment cap. On most loans that adjust every six months, the
adjustment cap is 1 percent. In other words, the interest rate that the loan
charges can move up or down no more than one percentage point in a given
adjustment period.
Loans that adjust more than once per year usually limit the maximum rate
change that’s allowed over the entire year as well. On the vast majority of
such loans, 2 percent is the annual rate cap. Likewise, almost all adjustables
come with lifetime caps. These caps limit the highest rate allowed over the
entire life of the loan. It’s common for adjustable loans to have lifetime caps 5
to 6 percent higher than the initial start rate.
Never take an ARM that lacks rate caps! Doing so is worse than giving a credit
card with an unlimited line of credit to your teenager for the weekend — at
least you get the credit card back on Monday! When you want to take an
adjustable-rate mortgage, you must identify the maximum payment that
you can handle. If you can’t handle the highest allowed payment, then don’t
look at ARMs.
Avoiding negative amortization ARMs
As you make mortgage payments over time, the loan balance you still owe is
gradually reduced or amortized. Negative amortization — increasing your
loan balance — is the reverse of this process. Some ARMs allow negative
amortization. How can your outstanding loan balance grow when you con-
tinue to make mortgage payments? This phenomenon occurs when your
mortgage payment is less than it really should be.
Some loans cap the increase of your monthly payment but don’t cap the
interest rate. Thus, the size of your mortgage payment may not reflect all
the interest that you owe on your loan. So rather than paying the interest
255
Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making

that you owe and paying off some of your loan balance (or principal) every
month, you end up paying off some, but not all, of the interest that you owe.
Thus, lenders add the extra, unpaid interest that you still owe to your out-
standing debt.
Negative amortization resembles paying only the minimum payment that
your credit card bill requires. You continue to rack up finance charges (in this
case, greater interest) on the balance as long as you make only the artificially
low payment. Taking a loan with negative amortization defeats the whole pur-
pose of borrowing an amount that fits your overall financial goals.
My advice: Avoid adjustables with negative amortization. The only way to
know whether a loan includes negative amortization is to explicitly ask. Most
lenders and mortgage brokers aren’t forthcoming about telling you. You find
negative amortization more frequently on loans that lenders consider risky. If
you have trouble finding lenders that will deal with your financial situation,
make sure that you’re especially careful.
Understanding other mortgage fees
In addition to points and the ongoing interest rate, lenders tack on all sorts of
other upfront charges in processing your loan. Get an itemization of these
other fees and charges in writing from all lenders that you’re seriously con-
sidering. You need to know the total of all lender fees so that you can accu-
rately compare different lenders’ loans and determine how much closing on
your loan will cost you. Other mortgage fees can pile up in a hurry. Here are
the common ones that you may see:
 Application and processing fees: Most lenders charge a few hundred
dollars to work with you to complete your paperwork and funnel it
through their loan evaluation process. Should your loan be rejected,
or if it’s approved and you decide not to take it, the lender needs to
cover its costs. Some lenders return this fee to you upon closing with
their loan.
 Credit report: Most lenders charge you for the cost of obtaining your
credit report, which tells the lender whether you’ve repaid other loans
on time. Your credit report should cost about $50.
 Appraisal: The property for which you borrow money needs to be valued.
If you default on your mortgage, a lender doesn’t want to get stuck with
a property that’s worth less than you owe. The cost for an appraisal typi-
cally ranges from several hundred dollars for most residential properties
to as much as $1,000 or more for larger investment properties.
256
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

Some lenders offer loans without points or other lender charges. Remember:
If they don’t charge points or other fees, they charge a higher interest rate
on your loan to make up the difference. Such loans may make sense for you
when you lack the cash to close a loan or when you plan to hold onto the
loan for just a few years.
To minimize your chances of throwing money away on a loan that you may
not qualify for, ask the lender whether there is any reason your loan request
may be denied. Be sure to disclose any problems on your credit report or any
problems with the property that you’re aware of. Lenders may not take the
time to ask about these sorts of things in their haste to get you to complete
their loan applications.
Finding the best lenders
You can easily save thousands of dollars in interest charges and other fees if
you shop around for a mortgage deal. It doesn’t matter whether you do so on
your own or hire someone to help you, but you should shop because much
money is at stake!
Shopping yourself
Many mortgage lenders compete for your business. Although having a large
number of lenders to choose from is good for keeping interest rates lower, it
also makes shopping a chore.
Real estate agents can refer you to lenders with whom they’ve done business.
Those lenders don’t necessarily offer the most competitive rates — the agent
simply may have done business with them in the past or received client refer-
rals from them.
Look in the real estate section of a large, local Sunday newspaper for charts
of selected lender interest rates. Just as with Internet sites that advertise
lender rates, these tables are by no means comprehensive or reflective of the
best rates available. In fact, many of these rates are sent to newspapers for
free by firms that distribute mortgage information to mortgage brokers. Use
them as a starting point and call the lenders that list the best rates.
HSH Associates (800-873-2837; www.hsh.com) publishes mortgage informa-
tion for most metropolitan areas. For $20, you can receive a list of dozens of
lenders’ rate quotes, but you need to be a data junkie to wade through all the
numbers on the multipage report of abbreviations in small print.
257
Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making

Shopping through a mortgage broker
A competent mortgage broker can be a big help in getting you a good loan
and closing the deal, especially if you’re too busy or disinterested to dig for
a good deal on a mortgage. A good mortgage broker also keeps abreast of the
many different mortgages in the marketplace. He or she can shop among lots
of lenders to get you the best deal available. The following list presents some
additional advantages to working with a mortgage broker:
 An organized and detail-oriented mortgage broker can help you through
the process of completing all those tedious documents that lenders
require.
 Mortgage brokers can help polish your loan package so that the informa-
tion that you present is favorable yet truthful.
 The best brokers can also help educate you about various loan options
and the pros and cons of available features.
 Brokers can also help get your loan approved if you anticipate that
lenders may be skittish about offering you a loan. Problems on your credit
report make lenders uncomfortable. If you want to borrow a large amount
(90 percent or more) of the value of a property, many lenders aren’t
interested. Certain types of properties, such as co-ops and tenancies-in-
common, give many lenders cold feet because these buildings tend to
give them more problems.
Be careful when you choose a mortgage broker, because some brokers are
lazy and don’t shop the market for the best current rates. Even worse, some
brokers may direct their business to specific lenders so they can take a
bigger cut or commission.
A mortgage broker typically gets paid a percentage, usually 0.5 to 1 percent,
of the loan amount. This commission is completely negotiable, especially on
larger loans that are more lucrative.
You need to ask what the commission is on loans that a broker pitches. Some
brokers may be indignant that you ask — that’s their problem. You have
every right to ask — it’s your money.
Even if you plan to shop on your own, talking to a mortgage broker may be
worthwhile. At the very least, you can compare what you find with what bro-
kers say they can get for you. Again, be careful. Some brokers tell you what
you want to hear — that is, that they can beat your best find — and then
aren’t able to deliver when the time comes.
If your loan broker quotes you a really good deal, make sure that you ask who
the lender is. (Most brokers refuse to reveal this information until you pay
the necessary fee to cover the appraisal and credit report.) You can check
with the actual lender to verify the interest rate and points that the broker
quotes you and make sure that you’re eligible for the loan.
258
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

Dealing with loan problems
Even if you have perfect or near-perfect credit, you may encounter financing
problems with some properties. And of course, not all real estate buyers
have a perfect credit history, tons of available cash, and no debt. If you’re
one of those borrowers who ends up jumping through more hoops than
others to get a loan, don’t give up hope. Few borrowers are perfect from a
lender’s perspective, and many problems aren’t that difficult to fix.
The best defense against loan rejection is avoiding it in the first place. To
head off potential rejection before you apply for the loan, you can sometimes
disclose to your lender anything that may cause a problem. For example, if
you already know that your credit report indicates some late payments from
when you were out of the country for several weeks five years ago, write a
letter that explains this situation.
Lacking down payment money
Most people, especially when they make their first real-estate purchase, are
strapped for cash. In order to qualify for the most attractive financing, lenders
typically require that your down payment be at least 20 percent of the prop-
erty’s purchase price. The best investment property loans sometimes require
25 to 30 percent down for the best terms. In addition, you need reserve money
to pay for other closing costs, such as title insurance and loan fees.
If you don’t have 20-plus percent of the purchase price available, don’t panic
and don’t get depressed — you can still own real estate. The following are the
most common workarounds:
 Take out private mortgage insurance: Some lenders may offer you a
mortgage even though you can put down only 5 to 10 percent of the pur-
chase price. These lenders will likely require you to purchase private
mortgage insurance (PMI) for your loan. This insurance generally costs
a few hundred dollars per year and protects the lender if you default on
your loan. (When you do have at least 20 percent equity in the property,
you can generally eliminate the PMI.)
 Dip into your retirement savings: Some employers allow you to borrow
against your retirement account balance, under the condition that you
repay the loan within a set number of years. Subject to eligibility require-
ments, first-time homebuyers can make penalty-free withdrawals of up
to $10,000 from IRA accounts. (Note: You still must pay regular income
tax on the withdrawal.)
 Postpone your purchase: If you don’t want the cost and strain of extra
fees and bad mortgage terms, you can also postpone your purchase. Go
on a financial austerity program and boost your savings rate.
259
Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making

 Consider lower-priced properties: Smaller properties and ones that
need some work can help keep down the purchase price and the
required down payment.
 Find a partner: Make sure that you write up a legal contract to specify
what happens if a partner wants out. Family members sometimes make
good partners. Your parents, grandparents, and maybe even your sib-
lings may have some extra cash they’d like to loan, invest, or even give
to you as a gift!
 Look into seller financing: Some property owners or developers may
finance your purchase with as little as 5 to 10 percent down. However,
you can’t be as picky about such seller-financed properties because a
limited supply is available and many that are available need work or
haven’t yet sold for other reasons.
Clearing up credit history blemishes
Late payments, missed payments, or debts that you never bothered to pay
can tarnish your credit report and squelch a lender’s desire to offer you a
mortgage. If you’re turned down for a loan because of your less-than-stellar
credit history, request (at no charge to you) a copy of your credit report from
the lender that turned down your loan.
But if you think that your credit history may be a problem, the first thing to do
is to get the facts. Thanks to a recent law passed by Congress, you are entitled
to one free credit report per year from each of the three consumer reporting
companies — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. You can choose to get all
three reports at once or space them out throughout the year. The companies
have set up one central Web site where you can access these reports
(www.annualcreditreport.com), or you can call toll-free at 877-322-8228.
Just be careful not to buy the credit services these companies will pitch you.
Explain credit report problems to your lender. If the lender is unsympathetic,
try calling other lenders. Tell them your credit problems upfront and see
whether you can find one willing to offer you a loan. Mortgage brokers may
also be able to help you shop for lenders in these cases.
Sometimes you may feel that you’re not in control when you apply for a loan.
In reality, you can fix a number of credit problems yourself. And you can
often explain those that you can’t fix. Remember that some lenders are more
lenient and flexible than others. Just because one mortgage lender rejects
your loan application doesn’t mean that all the others will as well.
As for erroneous information listed on your credit report, get on the phone to
the credit bureaus and start squawking. If specific creditors are the culprits,
call them too. Keep notes from your conversations and make sure that you put
your case in writing and add your comments to your credit report. If the cus-
tomer service representatives you talk with are no help, send a letter to the
260
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

president of each company. Let the head honcho know that his or her organiza-
tion caused you problems in obtaining credit. For more information on examin-
ing and disputing items on your credit report and managing credit in general,
check out the Federal Trade Commission’s Web site at www.ftc.gov/credit.
Another common credit problem is having too much consumer debt at the
time you apply for a mortgage. The more credit card, auto loan, and other
consumer debt you rack up, the less mortgage you qualify for. If you’re
turned down for the mortgage, consider it a wake-up call to get rid of this
high-cost debt. Hang onto the dream of buying real estate and plug away at
paying off your debts before you attempt another foray into real estate.
Dealing with low appraisals
Even if you have sufficient income, a clean credit report, and an adequate
down payment, the lender may turn down your loan if the appraisal of the
property that you want to buy comes in too low. It’s unusual for a property
not to appraise for what a buyer agrees to pay — odds are that the real
market value of the property is less than you agreed to pay.
Assuming that you still like the property, renegotiate a lower price with the
seller, using the low appraisal. With a low appraisal on a property that you
already own and are refinancing, you obviously need to follow a different
path. If you have the cash available, you can simply put more money down
to get the loan balance to a level for which you qualify. If you don’t have the
cash, you may need to forgo the refinance until you save more money or until
the property value rises.
In rare cases, lenders sometimes lowball an appraisal (intentionally under-
value) on refinances to sabotage a loan. A lender may do so, for example, if
your current mortgage is under better terms (from their point of view). If you
suspect that the lender is sabotaging your appraisal, ask for a copy of your
appraisal, which you are entitled to. If you have comparable sale prices of
homes from your area that support your case, go back to the lender and see
what he or she has to say. If you’re still not satisfied, complain to the state
regulator of mortgage lenders. However, applying for a new mortgage
through another lender may be much less of a hassle.
Not producing enough income
If you’re self-employed or have changed jobs, your current income may not
resemble your past income or, more importantly, your income may not be
what a mortgage lender likes to see in respect to the amount that you want to
borrow. A simple (but often impossible) way around this problem is to make
a larger down payment. For example, if you put down 30 percent or more, you
may be able to get a no-income-verification loan. If you can make a down pay-
ment that large, lenders probably don’t care what your income is — they’ll
simply repossess and then sell your property if you default on the loan.
261
Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making

If you can’t make a large down payment, another option is to get a cosigner
for the loan — your relatives may be willing. As long as they aren’t overex-
tended themselves, they may be able to help you qualify for a larger loan
than you can get on your own. As with partnerships, put your agreement in
writing so that no misunderstandings occur.
Refinancing for a better deal
When you buy a property, you take out a mortgage based on your circum-
stances and available loan options at that time. But things change. Maybe
interest rates have dropped, or you have access to better loan options now
than when you first purchased. Or perhaps you want to tap into some of your
real estate equity for other investments.
If interest rates drop and you’re able to refinance, you can lock in interest
rate savings. But a lower interest rate since you took out your original mort-
gage isn’t reason enough to refinance your mortgage. Remember that when
you refinance a mortgage, you have to spend money and time to save money.
So you need to crunch a few numbers to determine whether refinancing
makes sense for you.
Calculate how many months it will take you to recoup the costs of refinanc-
ing, such as appraisal costs, loan fees and points, title insurance, and so on.
For example, if the refinance costs you $2,000 to complete and reduces your
monthly payment by $100, it may appear that you can make the cost of the
refinance back in 20 months. However, because you lose some tax write-offs if
you reduce your mortgage interest rate and payment, you can’t simply look
at the reduced amount of your monthly payment.
If you want a better estimate but don’t want to spend hours crunching num-
bers, take your tax rate as specified in Chapter 3 (for example, 27 percent)
and reduce your monthly payment savings on the refinance by this amount.
That means, continuing with the example in the preceding paragraph, that if
your monthly payment drops by $100, you’re actually saving only around $73
a month after you factor in the lost tax benefits. So it takes about 28 months
($2,000 divided by $73), not 20 months, to recoup the refinance costs.
Consider refinancing when you can recover the costs of the refinance within
a few years or less and you don’t plan to move in that time frame. Should it
take longer to recoup the refinance costs, refinancing may still make sense if
you anticipate keeping the property and mortgage that long. If you estimate
that breaking even will take more than five to seven years, refinancing is
probably too risky to justify the costs and hassles.
262
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

Refinancing a piece of real estate that you own to pull out cash for some
other purpose can make good financial sense because under most circum-
stances, mortgage interest is tax-deductible. Perhaps you want to purchase
another piece of real estate, start or purchase a business, or get rid of some
high-cost consumer debt on credit cards or an auto loan. The interest on con-
sumer debt is not tax-deductible and is usually at a much higher interest rate
than what mortgage loans charge you.
Be careful that you don’t borrow more than you need to accomplish your
financial goals. For example, just because you can borrow more against the
equity in your real estate doesn’t mean that you should do so to buy an
expensive new car or take your dream vacation.
Closing the Deal
After you locate a property that you want to buy and understand your financ-
ing options, the real fun begins. Now you have to put the deal together. The
following sections discuss key things to keep in mind.
263
Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making
When to consider a home equity loan
Home equity loans, also known as second mort-
gages, allow you to borrow against the equity in
your home in addition to the mortgage that you
already have (a first mortgage).
A home equity loan may benefit you if you need
more money for just a few years or if your first
mortgage is at such a low interest rate that refi-
nancing it to get more cash would be too costly.
Otherwise, I advise you to avoid home equity
loans.
If you need a larger mortgage, why not refinance
the first one and wrap it all together? Home equity
loans have higher interest rates than comparable
first mortgages. They’re riskier from a lender’s
perspective because the first mortgage lender
gets first claim against your property if you file
bankruptcy or you default on the mortgage.
Interest on home mortgage loans of up to $1 mil-
lion (first or second residences) is tax-deductible
for loans taken out after October 13, 1987. (Loans
taken before that date have no monetary limit.)
Interest deduction on home equity loans is lim-
ited to the first $100,000 of such debt.

Negotiating 101
When you work with an agent, the agent usually carries the burden of the
negotiation process. But even if you delegate responsibility for negotiating to
your agent, you still need to have a plan and strategy in mind. Otherwise, you
may overpay for real estate.
Find out about the property and the owner before you make your offer. How
long has the property been on the market? What are its flaws? Why is the
owner selling? The more you understand about the property you want to buy
and the seller’s motivations, the better your ability is to draft an offer that
meets everyone’s needs. Some listing agents love to talk and will tell you the
life history of the seller. Either you or your agent may be able to get them to
reveal helpful information about the seller.
Also, bring facts to the bargaining table. Get comparable sales data to sup-
port your price. Too often, homebuyers and their agents pick a number out of
the air when they make an offer. If you were the seller, would you be per-
suaded to lower your asking price? Pointing to recent and comparable home
sales to justify your offer price strengthens your case.
Remember that price is only one of several negotiable items. Sometimes sell-
ers fixate on selling their homes for a certain amount. Perhaps they want to
get at least what they paid for it themselves several years ago. You may get a
seller to pay for certain repairs or improvements or to offer you an attractive
loan without all the extra fees that a bank charges. Also, be aware that the
time for closing on the purchase is a bargaining point. Some sellers may need
cash soon and may concede other terms if you can close quickly. Likewise,
the real estate agent’s commission is negotiable.
Finally, try to leave your emotions out of any property purchase. This is easier
said than done and hardest to do when you purchase a home in which you’ll
live. Try, as best you can, not to fall in love with a property. Keep searching
for other properties even when you make an offer because you may be negoti-
ating with an unmotivated seller.
Inspecting the property
Unless you’ve built homes and other properties and performed contracting
work yourself, you probably have no idea what you’re getting yourself into
when it comes to furnaces and termites.
264
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

Spend the money and time to hire inspectors and other experts to evaluate
the major systems and potential problem areas of the home. Because you
can’t be certain of the seller’s commitment, I recommend that you do the
inspections after you’ve successfully negotiated and signed a sales contract.
Although you won’t have the feedback from the inspections to help with this
round of negotiating, you can always go back to the seller with the new infor-
mation. Make your purchase offer contingent on a satisfactory inspection.
Hire people to help you inspect the following features of the property. (With
multiunit rental property, be sure to read Chapter 11 for other specifics that
you need to check out, such as parking.)
 Overall condition of the property
For example, is the paint peeling, are the floors level, are appliances pre-
sent and working well, and so on?
 Electrical, heating and air conditioning, and plumbing systems
 Foundation
 Roof
 Pest control and dry rot
 Seismic/slide/flood risk
Inspection fees often pay for themselves. If you uncover problems that you
weren’t aware of when you negotiated the original purchase price, the inspec-
tion reports give you the information you need to go back and ask the prop-
erty seller to fix the problems or reduce the property’s purchase price.
Never accept a seller’s inspection report as your only source of information.
When a seller hires an inspector, he or she may hire someone who isn’t as
diligent and critical of the property. Review the seller’s inspection reports if
available, but get your own as well. Also, beware of inspectors who are popu-
lar with real estate agents. They may be popular because they don’t bother
to document all the property’s problems.
As with other professionals whose services you retain, interview a few differ-
ent inspection companies. Ask which systems they inspect and how detailed
a report they can prepare for you. Consider asking the company that you’re
thinking of hiring for customer references. Ask for names and phone numbers
of three people who used the company’s services within the past six months.
Also, request from each inspection company a sample of one of its reports.
The day before you close on the purchase, take a brief walk-through of the
property to make sure that everything is still in the condition it was before
and that all the fixtures, appliances, curtains, and other items the contract
lists are still there. Sometimes, sellers ignore or don’t recall these things, and
consequently, they don’t leave what they agreed to in the sales contract.
265
Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making

Shopping for the best title insurance
and escrow fees
Mortgage lenders require title insurance to protect against someone else
claiming legal title to your property. This can happen, for example, when a
husband and wife split up, and the one who remains in the home decides to
sell and take off with the money. If the title lists both spouses as owners, the
spouse who sells the property (possibly by forging the other’s signature) has
no legal right to do so. The other spouse can come back and reclaim rights to
the home even after it has been sold. In this event, both you and the lender
can get stuck holding the bag. (If you’re in the enviable position of paying
cash for a property, buying title insurance is still wise, even though a mort-
gage lender won’t prod you to do so. You need to protect your investment.)
Title insurance and escrow fees may vary from company to company. (Escrow
charges pay for neutral third-party services to ensure that the instructions of
the purchase contract or refinance are fulfilled and that everyone gets paid.)
Don’t simply use the company that your real estate agent or mortgage lender
suggests — shop around. When you call around for title insurance and escrow
fee quotes, make sure that you understand all the fees. Many companies tack
on all sorts of charges for things such as courier fees and express mail. If you
find a company with lower prices and want to use it, consider asking for an
itemization in writing so that you don’t receive any unpleasant surprises.
An insurance company’s ability to pay claims is always important. Most state
insurance departments monitor and regulate title insurance companies. Title
insurers rarely fail, and most state departments of insurance do a good job
shutting down financially unstable ones. Check with your state’s department
if you’re concerned. You can also ask the title insurer for copies of its ratings
from insurance-rating agencies.
Selling Real Estate
You should buy and hold real estate for the long term. If you do your home-
work, buy in a good area, and work hard to find a fairly priced or underpriced
property, why sell it in a few years and incur all the selling costs, time, and
hassle to locate and negotiate another property to purchase?
Some real estate investors like to buy properties in need of improvement, fix
them up, and then sell them and move on to another. Unless you’re a contrac-
tor or experienced real estate investor and have a real eye for this type of
work, don’t expect to make a windfall or even to earn back more than the cost
of the improvements. The process of buying, fixing, and flipping can be prof-
itable, but it’s not as easy as the home-improvement television shows and
266
Part III: Getting Rich with Real Estate 

some books would have you believe. In fact, it’s more likely that you’ll erode
your profit through the myriad costs of frequent buying and selling. The vast
majority of your profits should come from the long-term appreciation of the
overall real estate market in the communities that you own property in.
Use the reasons that you bought in an area as a guide if you think you want to
sell. Use the criteria that I discuss in Chapter 11 as a guideline. For example, if
the schools in the community are deteriorating and the planning department
is allowing development that will hurt the value of your property and the rents
that you can charge, you may have cause to sell. Unless you see significant
problems like these in the future, holding good properties over many years is
a great way to build your wealth and minimize transaction costs.
Negotiating real estate agents’ contracts
Most people use an agent to sell real estate. As I discuss in “Finding a good
agent,” earlier in this chapter, selling and buying a home demand agents with
different strengths. When you sell a property, you want an agent who can get
the job done efficiently and for as high a sales price as possible.
As a seller, you should seek agents who have marketing and sales expertise and
who are willing to put in the time and money necessary to sell your house.
Don’t be impressed by an agent just because she works for a large company.
What matters more is what the agent can do to market your property.
When you list a property for sale, the contract that you sign with the listing
agent includes specification of the commission that you pay the agent if he
succeeds in selling your property. In most areas of the country, agents usu-
ally ask for a 6 percent commission for single-family homes. In an area that
maintains lower-cost housing, agents may ask for 7 percent. For small multi-
family properties and commercial properties, commissions are often in the 3
to 5 percent range.
Regardless of the commission an agent says is “typical,” “standard,” or “what
my manager requires,” always remember that you can negotiate commis-
sions. Because the commission is a percentage, you have much greater abil-
ity to get a lower commission on a higher-priced property. If an agent makes 6
percent selling both a $200,000 and a $100,000 property, the agent makes
twice as much on the $200,000 property. Yet selling the higher-priced prop-
erty doesn’t usually take twice as much work.
If you live in an area with higher-priced properties, you may be able to negoti-
ate a 5 percent commission. For expensive properties, a 4 percent commis-
sion is reasonable. You may find, however, that your ability to negotiate a
lower commission is greatest when an offer is on the table. Because of the
cooperation of agents who work together through the multiple listing service
(MLS), if you list your real estate for sale at a lower commission than most
267
Chapter 12: Real Estate Financing and Deal Making

other properties, some agents won’t show it to prospective buyers. For this
reason, you’re better off having your listing agent cut his take instead of cut-
ting the commission that you pay to a real estate agent who brings a buyer
for your property to you.
In terms of the length of the listing agreement, three months is reasonable. If
you give an agent too long to list your property (6 to 12 months), the agent
may simply toss your listing into the multiple listing book and not expend
much effort to get your property sold. Practically speaking, you can fire your
agent whenever you want, regardless of the length of the listing agreement,
but a shorter listing may motivate your agent more.
Selling without a real estate agent
The temptation to sell real estate without an agent is usually to save the com-
mission that an agent deducts from your property’s sale price. If you have the
time, energy, and marketing experience, you can sell sans agent and possibly
save some money.
The major problem with attempting to sell real estate on your own is that
you can’t list it in the MLS, which, in most areas, only real estate agents can
access. If you’re not listed in the MLS, many potential buyers never know that
your home is for sale. Agents who work with buyers don’t generally look for
or show their clients properties that are for sale by owner or listed with dis-
count brokers.
Besides saving you time, a good agent can help ensure that you’re not sued
for failing to disclose known defects of your property. If you decide to sell on
your own, have access to a legal advisor who can review the contracts. Take
the time to educate yourself about the many facets of selling property for top
dollar — read House Selling For Dummies, which I coauthored with Ray Brown
(published by Wiley).

Here, I explain such things as how to develop a business

Entrepreneurial Ambitions

 Exploring alternatives to starting your own company
 Looking at small-business investment options
 Mapping out your small-business plans
M
any people dream about running their own companies, and for good
reason. If you start your own business, you can pursue something that
you’re passionate about and you have more control over how you do things.
Plus, successful business owners can reap major economic bounties.
But tales of entrepreneurs becoming multimillionaires focus attention on the
financial rewards without revealing the business and personal challenges and
costs associated with being in charge. Consider what your company has to
do well in order to survive and succeed in the competitive business world:
 Develop products and services that the marketplace purchases.
 Price your offerings properly and promote them. What good are your
products and services if others don’t know about and buy them?
 Deal with the competition. Your success will likely spur imitators.
 Manage the accounting. You’ll be confronted with tracking revenue and
expenses, making tax payments, and perhaps handling a payroll.
 Interpret lease contracts and evaluate office space.
 Keep current with changes in your field. Reading trade and profes-
sional journals can help you do this.
 Manage employees. You need to know the right ways to hire, train, and
retain good employees. You may soon become an expert on insurance
and other employee benefits as well.

Business owners also face personal and emotional challenges, which rarely
get airtime among all the glory of the rags-to-riches tales of multimillionaire
entrepreneurs. Major health problems, divorces, fights and lawsuits among
family members who are in business together, the loss of friends, and even
suicides have been attributed to the passions of business owners who are
consumed with winning or become overwhelmed by their failures.
Had enough already? I’m not trying to scare you, but I do want you to be real-
istic about starting your own business. Maybe you do have the right stuff to
run your own company, but most people don’t.
Testing Your Entrepreneurial IQ
The keys to success and enjoyment as an entrepreneur vary as much as the
businesses do. But if you can answer yes to most of the following questions,
you probably have the qualities and perspective needed to succeed as a
small-business owner.
Don’t be deterred by those questions that you can’t answer in the affirmative.
A perfect entrepreneur doesn’t exist. Part of succeeding in business is know-
ing what you can’t do as well as what you can do and finding creative ways
(or people) to help you.
1. Are you a self-starter? Do you like challenges? Are you persistent? Are
you willing to do research to solve problems?
Running your own business isn’t glamorous most of the time, especially in the
early years. You have many details to mind and things to do. Success in busi-
ness is the result of doing lots of little things well. If you’re accustomed to
working for larger organizations where much of the day is spent attending
meetings and keeping up on office politics and gossip, with little accountability,
you probably won’t enjoy or succeed at running your own business.
2. Do you value independence and self-control?
Particularly in the early days of your business, you need to enjoy working on
your own. When you leave a company environment and work on your own,
you give up a lot of socializing. Of course, if you work in an unpleasant envi-
ronment or with people you don’t really enjoy socializing with, venturing out
on your own may be a plus.
If you’re a people person, many businesses offer lots of contact. But you must
recognize the difference between socializing with co-workers and networking
with business contacts and customers.
272
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

3. Can you develop a commitment to an idea, product, or principle?
Most entrepreneurs work about 50 hours per week, 50 or so weeks a year —
that’s about 2,500 hours per year. If the product, service, or cause that you’re
pursuing doesn’t excite you and you can’t motivate others to work hard for
you, you’re going to have a long year!
One of the worst reasons to start your own business is for the pursuit of
great financial riches. Don’t get me wrong — if you’re good at what you do
and you know how to market your services or products, you may make more
money working for yourself. But for most people, money isn’t enough of a
motivation, and many people make the same or less money on their own than
they did working for a company.
4. Are you willing to make financial sacrifices and live a reduced lifestyle
before and during your early entrepreneurial years?
“Live like a student, before and during the start-up of your small business”
was the advice that my best business school professor, James Collins, gave
me before I started my business. With most businesses, you expend money
during the start-up years and likely have a reduced income compared to the
income you receive while working for a company.
In order to make your entrepreneurial dream a reality, you need to live well
within your means both before and after you start your business. But if run-
ning your own business really makes you happy, sacrificing expensive vaca-
tions, overpriced luxury cars, the latest designer clothing, and $3 lattes at the
corner cafe shouldn’t be too painful.
5. Do you recognize that when you run your own business, you must still
report to bosses?
Besides the allure of huge profits, the other reason some people mistakenly go
into business for themselves is that they’re tired of working for other people.
Obnoxious, evil bosses can make anyone want to become an entrepreneur. I
understand — I’ve been there. When I worked at a consulting firm, I had a boss
— I’ll call him Goofus — whom I positively detested. Although the team that I
led spent many weeks preparing client presentations, Goofus didn’t really
focus on our material until a couple of days before the presentation. He then
made massive changes, causing the entire team, as well as the production
department that produced the presentation, to work 16-hour days and into the
wee hours of the morning. Goofus also made himself inaccessible for input and
advice and ignored voice mails until he got into crisis mode. He never apolo-
gized for his behavior and couldn’t have cared less about people’s personal
lives. Because of people like Goofus, employees who wanted some semblance
of control in their professional and personal lives left the consulting business.
273
Chapter 13: Evaluating Your Entrepreneurial Ambitions

When you run your own business, you have customers and other bosses just
like Goofus who are miserable to deal with. Fortunately, even the worst cus-
tomers usually can’t make your life anywhere near as miserable as bosses
like Goofus. (If you have enough customers, you can simply decide not to do
business with such jerks.)
6. Can you withstand rejection, naysayers, and negative feedback?
“I thought every no that I got when trying to raise my funding brought me one
step closer to a yes,” says Alex Popov, an entrepreneur I once met. Unless you
come from an entrepreneurial family, don’t expect your parents to endorse
your “risky, crazy” behavior. Even other entrepreneurs can ridicule your good
ideas. Two of my entrepreneurial friends were critical of each other’s idea, yet
both have succeeded! Some people (especially parents) simply think that work-
ing for a giant company makes you safer and more secure (which, of course, is
a myth, because corporations can lay you off in a snap). It’s also easier for
them to say to their friends and neighbors that you’re a big manager at a well-
known corporation (such as IBM, GE, Enron, or WorldCom) than to explain that
you’re working on some kooky business idea out of a spare bedroom. (How
secure do you think those former employees of Enron and WorldCom feel now
about having lost their jobs at their former large company?)
7. Are you able to identify your shortcomings and hire or align yourself
with people and organizations that complement your skills and expertise?
To be a successful entrepreneur, you need to be a bit of a jack-of-all-trades:
marketer, accountant, customer service representative, administrative assis-
tant, and so on. Unless you get lots of investor capital, which is rare for a true
start-up, you can’t afford to hire help in the early months, or perhaps even
years, of your business.
Partnering with or buying certain services or products rather than trying to
do everything yourself may make sense for you. And over time, if your busi-
ness grows and succeeds, you should be able to afford to hire more help. If
you can be honest with yourself and surround and partner yourself with
people whose skills and expertise complement yours, you can build a win-
ning team!
8. Do you deal well with ambiguity? Do you believe in yourself?
When you’re on your own, determining when and if you’re on the right track
is difficult. Some days, things don’t go well — and such days are much harder
to take flying solo. Therefore, being confident, optimistic, and able to work
around obstacles are necessary skills.

9. Do you understand why you started the business or organization and
how you personally define “success”?
Many business entrepreneurs define success by such measures as sales rev-
enue, profits, number of branch offices and employees, and so on. These are
fine measures, but other organizations, particularly nonprofits, have other
measures. For example, the Washington, D.C.-based nonpartisan Violence

Myths of being an entrepreneur
Many myths persist about what it takes to be an
entrepreneur, partly because those who aren’t
entrepreneurs tend to hang out with others who
aren’t. The mass media’s popularization of “suc-
cessful” entrepreneurs such as Bill Gates, Ted
Turner, and Oprah Winfrey leads to numerous
misperceptions and misconceptions, including
these often-cited nuggets:
You have to be well-connected or know
“important” people. I think that being a decent
human being is far more important. Enough
rude, inconsiderate, and self-centered people
are in the business world (and, yes, some of
them do succeed in spite of their character
flaws), and if you’re not that way, you’ll be able
to meet people who can help you in one way or
another. But remember that looking in the mirror
shows you your best and most trusted resource.
You need to have an M.B.A. or some other fancy
degree. Many successful entrepreneurs — Bill
Gates and Steve Jobs, for example — don’t
even have college degrees, for goodness’
sakes. Perusing Forbes magazine’s list of the
200 most financially successful small compa-
nies shows that about one in six of the CEOs
didn’t earn a college degree and about half
don’t have advanced degrees! These statistics
are even more amazing when you consider that
a relatively large number of entrepreneurs with
humble backgrounds leave or are forced out of
the successful enterprises they started.
I’m not saying that a good education isn’t worth-
while in general and that it can’t help you suc-
ceed in your own business. (For example, Ivy
Leaguers run about 6 percent of the 200 best
small businesses, yet Ivy League college grads
make up less than 1 percent of all graduates.)
But a formal education isn’t necessary.
You need to be a genius. Intelligence is admit-
tedly a difficult thing to measure, but the major-
ity of entrepreneurs have IQs under 120, and a
surprising percentage have IQs under the aver-
age of 100 — more entrepreneurs, in fact, have
IQs under 100 than have IQs greater than 130!
You must be a gregarious, big-egoed extrovert.
Although some studies show that more entre-
preneurs are extroverted, many entrepreneurs
are not.
You have to be willing to take a huge risk. Some
people focus on the potential for failure. Con-
sider the worst-case scenario — if your venture
doesn’t work out, you can always go back to a job
similar to the one you left behind. Also, recognize
that risk is a matter of perception, and as with
investments, people completely overlook some
risks. What about the risk to your happiness and
career if you stay in a boring, claw-your-way-up-
the-corporate-ladder kind of job? You always risk
a layoff when you work for a company. An even
greater risk is that you’ll wake up in your 50s and
60s and think that it’s too late to do something on
your own and wish you had tried to sooner.

Policy Center (VPC) seeks “to fight firearms violence through research, edu-
cation, and advocacy.” The following is a passage from VPC’s materials illus-
trating how the organization produces research for the purpose of public
policy advances:
The VPC study Joe Camel with Feathers: How the NRA with Gun and
Tobacco Industry Dollars Uses its Eddie Eagle Program to Market Guns to
Kids revealed how the National Rifle Association is following a trail blazed
by the tobacco industry — from youth “educational” programs that are in
fact marketing tools with appealing cartoon characters that put a friendly
face on a hazardous product — in its efforts to market guns to children
and youth.
In order to accomplish such goals as affecting public policy and public opinion
about an issue like gun violence, money is necessary, but such a cause-focused
organization has a “bottom line” very different from a for-profit organization.
10. Can you accept lack of success in the early years of building your busi-
ness?
A few rare businesses are instant hits, but most businesses take time to build
momentum — it may take years, perhaps even decades. Some successful cor-
porate people suffer from anxiety when they go out on their own and
encounter the inevitable struggles and lack of tangible success as they build
their companies.
Considering Alternative Routes
Sometimes, entrepreneurial advocates imply that running your own business
or starting your own nonprofit is the greatest thing in the world and that all
people would be happy owning their own business if they just set their mind
to it. The reality is that some people won’t be blissful as entrepreneurs. If you
didn’t score highly on my ten-question entrepreneur assessment in the pre-
ceding section, don’t despair. You can probably be happier and more suc-
cessful doing something other than starting your own business.
Some people are better off working for someone else. Consider the following
options.
Being an entrepreneur inside a company
A happy medium is available for people who want the challenge of running
their own show without giving up the comforts and security that come with a
company environment — for example, you can manage an entrepreneurial
276
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

venture at a company. That’s what John Kilcullen, president and chief execu-
tive officer of IDG Books Worldwide (former publisher of this book), did when
he helped launch the book publishing division of IDG in 1990. (IDG Books was
subsequently bought by John Wiley & Sons, Inc., in 2001.)
Kilcullen had publishing industry experience and wanted to take on the
responsibility of growing a successful publishing company. But he also knew
that being a player in the book publishing industry takes a lot of money and
resources. Because he was a member of the founding team of the new IDG
Books division, Kilcullen had the best of both worlds.
Kilcullen always had a passion to start his own business but found that most
traditional publishers weren’t interested in giving autonomy and money to a
division and letting it run with the ball. “I wanted the ability to build a busi-
ness on my own instincts . . . the appeal of IDG was that it was decentralized.
IDG was willing to invest and provide the freedom to spend as we saw fit.”
If you’re able to secure an entrepreneurial position inside a larger company,
in addition to significant managerial and operational responsibility, you can
also negotiate your share of the financial success that you helped create. The
parent company’s senior management wants you to have the incentive that
comes from sharing in the financial success of your endeavors. Bonuses,
stock options, and the like are often tied to the performance of a division.
Investing in your career
Some people are happy or content as employees. Companies need and want
lots of good employees, so you can find a job if you have skills, a work ethic,
and the ability to get along with others.
You can improve your income-earning ability and invest in your career in a
variety of different ways:
 Work: Be willing to work extra hours and take on more responsibility,
but do so within reason. Those who take extra initiative and then deliver
really stand out in a company where many people working on a salary
have a time-clock, 9-to-5 mentality. But be careful that the extra effort
doesn’t contribute to workaholism, a dangerous addiction that causes
too many people to neglect important personal relationships and their
own health. Don’t bite off more than you can chew — otherwise, your
supervisors won’t have faith that they can count on you to deliver. Find
ways to work smarter, not just longer, hours.
 Read: One of the reasons that you don’t need a Ph.D., master’s degree,
or even an undergraduate college degree to succeed in business is
that you can find out a lot on your own. You can gain insight by doing,
but you can also gain expertise by reading a lot. A good bookstore has
277
Chapter 13: Evaluating Your Entrepreneurial Ambitions

no entrance requirements, such as an elevated high school grade point
average or high SAT scores — you only have to walk through the doors.
A good book isn’t free, but it costs a heck of lot less than taking more
college or graduate courses!
 Study: If you haven’t completed your college or graduate degree and the
industry you’re in values those who have, consider investing the time
and money to finish your education. Speak with others who have taken
that path and see what they have to say.
Exploring Small-Business
Investment Options
Only your imagination limits the ways that you can make money with small
businesses. Choosing the option that best meets your needs isn’t unlike
choosing other investments, such as in real estate or in the securities mar-
kets. Following are the major ways you can invest in small business and
what’s attractive and not about each option.
Starting your own business
Of all your small-business options, starting your own business involves the
greatest amount of work. Although you can perform this work on a part-time
basis in the beginning, most people end up working in their business full time.
For most of my working years, I’ve run my own business, and overall, I really
like it. In my experience counseling small-business owners, I’ve seen many
people of varied backgrounds, interests, and skills achieve success and hap-
piness running their own businesses.
Most people perceive starting their own business as the riskiest of all small-
business investment options. But if you get into a business that utilizes your
skills and expertise, the risk isn’t nearly as great as you may think. Suppose
that you teach and make $35,000 per year and you want to set up your own
tutoring service, making a comparable amount of money. If you find through
your research that others who perform these services charge $35 per hour,
you need to actually tutor about 20 or so hours per week, assuming that you
work 50 weeks per year. Because you can run this business from your home
(which can possibly generate small tax breaks) without purchasing new
equipment, your expenses should be minimal.
278
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

Instead of leaving your job cold turkey and trying to build your business from
scratch, you can start moonlighting as a tutor. Over a couple of years, if you
can build the tutoring up to ten hours per week, you’re halfway to your goal.
If you leave your job and focus all your energies on your tutoring business,
getting to 20 hours per week of billable work shouldn’t be a problem. Still
think starting a business is risky?
279
Chapter 13: Evaluating Your Entrepreneurial Ambitions
Don’t start a business for tax write-offs
“Start a small business for fun, profit, and huge
tax deductions,” a financial advice book
declares, adding that “the tax benefits alone are
worth starting a small business.” A seminar
company offers a course entitled “How to Have
Zero Taxes Deducted from Your Paycheck.” This
tax seminar tells you how to solve your tax prob-
lems: “If you have a sideline business, or would
like to start one, you’re eligible to have little or
no taxes taken from your pay.”
All this sounds too good to be true — and of
course it is. Not only are the strategies sure to
lead to IRS-audit purgatory, but such books and
seminars may also seduce you to pony up $100
or more for audiotapes or notebooks of “inside
information.”
Unfortunately, many self-proclaimed self-help
gurus state that you can slash your taxes simply
by finding a product or service that you can sell
on the side of your regular employment. The
problem, they argue, is that as a regular wage
earner who receives a paycheck from an
employer, you can’t write off many of your other
(personal) expenses. Open a sideline business,
they say, and you can deduct your personal
expenses as business expenses.
The pitch is enticing, but the reality is something
quite different. You have to spend money to get
tax deductions, and the spending must be for
legitimate purposes of your business in its efforts
to generate income. If you think that taking tax
deductions for your hobby is worth the risk
because you won’t get caught unless you’re
audited, the odds are stacked against you. The
IRS audits an extraordinarily large portion of
small businesses that show regular losses.
The bottom line is that you need to operate a real
business for the purpose of generating income
and profits, not tax deductions. The IRS consid-
ers an activity a hobby (and not a business) if it
shows a loss for three or more of the preceding
five tax years. (Exception: The IRS considers
horse racing and breeding a hobby if it shows a
loss for five or more of the preceding seven tax
years.) Some years, a certain number of busi-
nesses lose money, but a real business can’t
afford to do so year after year and remain in
operation. Even if your sideline business passes
this hobby test, as well as other IRS require-
ments, deducting any expenses that aren’t
directly applicable to your business is illegal.
If these hobby-loss rules indicate that you’re
engaging in a hobby but you still want to claim
your losses, you must convince the IRS that
you’re seriously trying to make a profit and run
a legitimate business. The IRS wants to see that
you’re actively marketing your services, build-
ing your skills, and accounting for income and
expenses. The IRS also wants to see that you
don’t derive too much pleasure from an activity.
If you do, the IRS says that what you’re doing is
a hobby and not a business. Business isn’t sup-
posed to give you too much enjoyment!

Many businesses can be started with little money by leveraging your existing
skills and expertise. If you have the time to devote to building “sweat equity,”
you can build a valuable company and job. As long as you check out the com-
petition and offer a valued service at a reasonable cost, the principal risk
with your business is that you won’t do a good job marketing what you have
to offer. If you can market your skills, you should succeed.
Buying an existing business
If you don’t have a specific idea for a business that you want to start but you
have business management skills and an ability to improve existing busi-
nesses, consider buying an established business. Although you don’t have to
go through the riskier start-up period if you take this route, you’ll likely need
more capital to buy a going enterprise.
You also need to be able to deal with potentially sticky personnel and manage-
ment issues. The history of the organization and the way things work predates
your ownership of the business. If you don’t like making hard decisions, firing
people who don’t fit with your plans, and coercing people into changing the
way they did things before you arrived on the scene, buying an existing busi-
ness likely isn’t for you. Also realize that some of the good employees may be
loyal to the old owner and his style of running the business, so they may split
when you arrive.
Some people perceive that buying an existing business is safer than starting a
new one, but buying someone else’s business can actually be riskier. You’ll
have to shell out far more money upfront, in the form of a down payment, to
buy a business. If you don’t have the ability to run the business and it does
poorly, you may lose much more financially. Another risk is that the business
may be for sale for a reason — perhaps it’s not very profitable, it’s in decline,
or it’s generally a pain in the posterior to operate.
Good businesses that are for sale don’t come cheaply. If the business is a suc-
cess, the current owner has removed the start-up risk from the business, so the
price of the business should include a premium to reflect this lack of risk. If you
have the capital to buy an established business and you have the skills to run
it, consider going this route. Chapter 15 discusses how to buy a good business.
Investing in someone else’s business
If you like the idea of profiting from successful small businesses but don’t
want the day-to-day headaches of being responsible for managing the enter-
prise, you may want to invest in someone else’s small business. Although this
route may seem easier, fewer people are actually cut out to be investors in
other people’s businesses.
280
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

Investing for the right reasons
Consider investing in someone else’s business if you meet the following 
criteria:
 You have sufficient assets so that what you invest in small privately held
companies is a small portion (20 percent or less) of your total financial
assets.
 You can afford to lose what you invest. Unlike investing in a diversified
stock mutual fund (Chapter 8), you may lose all your investment when
you invest in a small, privately held company.
 You’re astute at evaluating financial statements and business strategies.
Investing in a small, privately held company has much in common with
investing in a publicly traded firm. The difference is that private firms
aren’t required to produce comprehensive, audited financial statements
that adhere to certain accounting principles the way that public compa-
nies are. Thus, you have a greater risk of not receiving sufficient or accu-
rate information when you evaluate a small private firm.
Putting money into your own business (or someone else’s) can be a high-risk —
but potentially high-return — investment. The best options are those that you
understand well. If you hear about a great business idea or company from
someone you know and trust, do your research and make your best judgment.
That company or idea may well be a terrific investment.
Before you invest, ask to see a copy of the business plan and compare it with
the business plan model that I suggest later in this chapter. Thoroughly check
out the people running the business. Talk to others who don’t have a stake
in the investment and benefit from their comments and concerns. But don’t
forget that many a wise person has rained on the parade of what turned out
to be a terrific business idea.
Avoiding investing mistakes
Although some people are extra careful when they invest other people’s
money, know that many small-business owners seek investors’ money for the
wrong reasons. Some business owners are impatient and perhaps don’t under-
stand the feasibility of making do with a small amount of capital (a process
called bootstrapping, which I discuss in Chapter 14).
Other businesses need money because they’re in financial trouble. One small
furniture retailer in my area conducted a stock offering to raise money. On the
surface, everything seemed fine, and the company made it onto the Inc. 500 list
of fast-growing small companies. But it turns out that the company wanted to
issue stock because it expanded too quickly and didn’t sell enough merchan-
dise to cover its high overhead. The company ended up in bankruptcy.
281
Chapter 13: Evaluating Your Entrepreneurial Ambitions

Another problem with small businesses that seek investors is that many
small-business owners may take more risk and do less upfront planning and
homework with other people’s money. Many well-intentioned people fail at
their businesses. An M.B.A. whom I know from a top business school — I’ll
call him Jacob — convinced an investor to put up about $300,000 to purchase
a small manufacturing company. Jacob put a small amount of his own money
into the business and immediately blew about $100,000 on a fancy-schmancy
computer scheduling and order-entry system.
Likewise, Jacob wasn’t interested much in sales (a job that the previous
owner managed), so he hired a sales manager. The sales manager he hired
was a disaster — many of the front-line salespeople fled to competitors,
taking key customers with them. By the time Jacob came to his senses, it was
too late — the disaster had unfolded. He tried to cut costs, but doing so hurt
the quality and timeliness of the company’s products. The business dis-
solved, and the investor lost everything.
Drawing Up the Business Plan
If you’re motivated to start your own business, the next step is to figure out
what you want to do and how you’re going to do it; in other words, you need
a business plan. You need a general plan that helps you define what you think
you want to do and the tasks that you need to perform to accomplish your
goal. The business plan, which is both for your own planning, to obtain loans,
and to show potential investors, should be a working document or blueprint
for the early days, months, and years of your business.
You don’t need a perfectly detailed plan that spells out all the minutiae.
Making such an involved plan is a waste of your time because things change
and evolve.
The amount of detail that your plan needs depends upon your goals and the
specifics of your business. A simple, more short-term focused plan (ten pages
or so) is fine if you don’t aspire to build an empire. However, if your goal is to
grow, hire employees, and open multiple locations, then your plan needs to
be longer (20 to 50 pages) to cover longer-term issues. If you want outside
investor money, a longer business plan is a necessity.
As you put together your plan and evaluate your opportunities, open your
ears and eyes. Expect to do research and to speak with other entrepreneurs
and people in the industry. Most people will spend time talking with you as
long as they realize that you don’t want to compete with them.
282
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

Identifying your business concept
What do you want your business to do? What product or service do you want
to offer? Maybe your business goal is to perform tax-preparation services
for small-business owners. Or perhaps you want to start a consulting firm,
open a restaurant that sells healthy fast food, run a gardening service, or
manufacture toys.
Alan Tripp started a company called Score Advantage Learning Centers. He
says his concept was “Score is a storefront center for computer-assisted
learning, where kids use computers to improve their reading, writing, math,
and science skills.”
Your concept doesn’t need to be unique to survive in the business world —
witness the legions of self-employed consultants, plumbers, tax preparers,
and restaurant owners. The existence of many other people who already do
what you want to do validates the potential for your small-business ideas. I
know many wage slaves who say they would love to run their own business if
they could only come up with “the idea.” Most of these people still dream
about their small-business plans as they draw their Social Security checks.
Being committed to the idea of running your own business is more important
than developing the next great product or service. In the beginning, the busi-
ness opportunities that you pursue can be quite general to your field of
expertise or interest. What you eventually do over time will evolve.
I’m not saying that an innovative idea lacks merit. A creative idea gives you
the chance to hit a big home run, and the first person to successfully develop
a new idea can achieve big success.
Even if you aspire to build the next billion-dollar company, you can put a twist
on older concepts. Suppose that you’re a veterinarian but you don’t want a
traditional office where people must bring their cats and dogs for treatment.
You believe that because many people are starved for free time, they want a
vet who makes house calls. Thus, you open your Vet on Wheels business. You
may also want to franchise the business and open locations around the coun-
try. However, you can also succeed by doing what thousands of other vets are
now doing and have done over the years with a traditional office.
Outlining your objectives
The reasons for starting and running your own small business are as varied
as the entrepreneurs behind their companies. Before you start your firm, it’s
useful to think about what you’re seeking to achieve. Your objectives need
not be cast in concrete and will surely change over time. If you like, you can
write a short and motivating mission statement.
283
Chapter 13: Evaluating Your Entrepreneurial Ambitions

When you ask an M.B.A., especially one from a big-name school, to think
about objectives, she usually says something like, “My goal is to run a $20
million company in seven years.” Financial objectives are fine, but don’t make
your objectives strictly financial unless money is the only reason that you
want to run your own business.

Introductory economics courses teach students that the objective of every
for-profit firm is to maximize profits. As with many things taught in econom-
ics courses, this theory has one problem — it doesn’t hold up in reality. Most
small-business owners I know don’t manage their businesses maniacally in
the pursuit of maximum profits. The following list gives you some other pos-
sible objectives to consider:
 Working with people you like and respect: Some customers may buy
your products and services, and some employees and suppliers may
offer you their services for a good price, but what if you can’t stand
working with them? If you have sufficient business or just have your
own standards, you can choose whom you do business with.
 Educating others: Maybe part of your business goal is to educate the
public about something that you’re an expert in. I know that when I
started my financial counseling and writing business, I saw education
as a core part of my company’s purpose.
 Improving an industry/setting a higher standard: Perhaps part of your
goal in starting your business is to show how your industry can better
serve its customers. John Bogle, who founded the Vanguard Group of
mutual funds, is a good example of someone who wanted to improve an
industry. When he started Vanguard more than three decades ago, Bogle
structured the company so that the shareholders (customers) of the
company’s individual mutual funds would own the company.
Because he relinquished ownership of his company, Bogle gave up the
opportunity to build a personal net worth that would easily be worth
several billion dollars today. But Bogle wanted to build a mutual fund
company that kept operating costs to a minimum and returned profits
to the customers in the form of lower operating fees, which are deducted
from a mutual fund’s returns. He’s also been outspoken about how
owners of many mutual fund companies operate their funds too much
out of self-interest instead of keeping their customers in mind.
Of course, you can’t accomplish these objectives without profits, and doing
these things isn’t inconsistent with generating greater profits. But if your objec-
tives are more than financial or your financial objectives aren’t your number-
one concern, don’t worry — that’s usually a good sign.
Analyzing the marketplace
The single most important area to understand is the marketplace in which
your business competes. To be successful, your business must not only pro-
duce a good product or service, but it must also reach customers and con-
vince them to buy your product. You should discern what the competition
has to offer, as well as its strengths and vulnerabilities. In most industries,
you also need to understand government regulations that affect the type of
business that you’re considering.
285
Chapter 13: Evaluating Your Entrepreneurial Ambitions

Meeting customer needs
If the market analysis is the most important part of the business plan, then
understanding your potential customers is the most important part of your
market analysis. If you don’t understand your desired customers and their
needs, don’t expect to have a successful business.
If you’re in a business that sells to consumers, consider your customers’
gender, age, income, geographic location, marital status, number of children,
education, living situation (rent or own), and the reasons they want your
product or service. Who are your prospective customers? Where do they
live, and what do they care about? If you sell to businesses, you need to
understand similar issues. What types of businesses may buy your product
or services? Why?
The best way to get to know your potential customers is to get out and talk to
them. In-person interviews and paper-based surveys both have their benefits.
Although more time consuming, live interviews allow you to go with the flow
of the conversation, improvise questions, and probe more interesting areas.
Although you can mail or fax paper-based surveys to many people with a mini-
mal investment of your time, the response rate is usually quite low, and the
answers are usually not as illuminating. To encourage better response, offer a
product or service sample or some other promotional item to those who help
you with your research. Doing so attracts people who are interested in your
product or service, which helps you define your target customers.
286
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
Research model companies
If your business provides products or services
similar to those that other companies offer,
identify two or three of your competitors that do
a good job or seem most similar. Which of these
companies’ practices do you want to emulate?
In what areas can you improve upon or differ-
entiate your offerings?
Even if you have an innovative and apparently
unique concept, examine companies in related
and even dissimilar fields to identify those that
you want to emulate. Identify traits and charac-
teristics from several so that you can build them
into the composite of your own firm.
For the model companies that you examine, find
information about the following:
 Why they chose their location
 How they promote their services and 
products
 How they provide or manufacture their
products and services
 What types of customers they attract
 What their revenues, expenses, and prof-
itability are
 How they’ve expanded their locations over
time (if this is your goal)

Also, try to get a sense of what customers do pay and will pay for the products
or services that you offer. Analyzing the competition’s offerings helps, too.
Some products or services also require follow-up or additional servicing.
Understand what customers need and what they will pay for your services.
If you want to raise money from investors, include some estimates as to the
size of the market for your product or services. Of course, such numbers are
ballpark estimates, but sizing the market for your product helps you estimate
profitability, the share of the market needed to be profitable, and so on.
Besting the competition
Always examine the products, services, benefits, and prices that competitors
offer. Otherwise, you go on blind faith that what you offer stacks up well
versus the alternatives in the industry.
You first need to decide whether you have a realistic chance of winning the
consumer choice battle. I think you’ll agree that going into the same discount
warehouse retailing business and competing head-to-head with Wal-Mart,
Costco, or Home Depot is crazy.
Examine your competitors’ weaknesses so you can exploit them. Rather than
trying to beat them on their terms, maybe you’ve identified a need for a
neighborhood pet supply store that offers a much broader and more special-
ized range of pet supplies than the big-selling brands of dog and cat food that
warehouse stores sell. Providing knowledgeable customer sales representa-
tives to answer customer questions and make product suggestions can also
give you a competitive edge.
Thus, you may be able to surpass the warehouse stores on three counts: con-
venience of location for people in your neighborhood, breadth of product offer-
ings, and customer assistance. Offering only economy sizes of the best-selling
brands of pet food to compete with warehouse stores would be foolish. Your
prices may have to be higher because you can’t negotiate the volume discount
purchases that they can. You may also have greater overhead (not in absolute
dollars but as a percentage of your revenue) running a small business.
However, that’s not to say that your neighborhood pet supply store can’t offer
some best-selling pet food. As I’m sure you know, some convenience store cus-
tomers pay top dollar for smaller bags of supplies that they can purchase close
to home.
If you want to open a neighborhood pet supply store, evaluate a number of
different locales to see where other similar stores are located. Visit those
stores and observe their strengths and weaknesses. If you’re discreet, you
may be able to interview some customers outside the stores to see what they
like and don’t like about the competition.
287
Chapter 13: Evaluating Your Entrepreneurial Ambitions

Don’t make the mistake of thinking that even if you have a completely innova-
tive product or service that no other business currently offers, you don’t
have competitors. All businesses have competitors. In the highly unlikely
event that you’ve developed something truly unique that has little competi-
tion, your success will surely breed competition as imitators follow or
attempt to leapfrog your lead.
Complying with regulations
Most businesses are subject to some sort of regulation. If you want to start a
retail business, for example, few communities permit you to run it out of your
home. If you lease or purchase a private location, the zoning laws in that
location may restrict you. Therefore, you need to check what you can and
can’t sell at that location. Check with the zoning department of your city or
town — don’t simply believe a real estate broker or property owner who
says, “No problem!” That person’s goal, after all, is to sell the property.
If you were going to start a veterinary practice, you would quickly discover
that special zoning is required to use a piece of real estate for a vet’s office.
Convincing a local zoning board to allow a new location to get such special
zoning is quite difficult, if not impossible, in some areas.
Many businesses face other local, state, and even federal regulatory issues,
including ordinances, laws, and the need for specific licenses and filings. For
example, if you were opening a restaurant, you’d have to heed ordinances
and laws that regulate everything from signage to operating hours to your
ability to serve alcohol. And you’d be subject to an amazing array of health
codes, building codes, and fire codes, to name a few.
If you enter an industry that you’re relatively new to, ask questions and open
your ears to start finding out more about the location and function of your
business. Speak to people who are currently in the field and your local cham-
ber of commerce to see what, if any, licenses or filings you must complete.
Also, check out your local bookstore. If running a plumbing business inter-
ests you, read books on the subject. Also, check the newsstand and local
library for trade magazines that may deal with your questions. Libraries have
books and online services that can help you locate specific articles on topics
that interest you.
Delivering your service or product
Every business has a product or service to sell. How are you going to provide
this product or service? Suppose that you want to start a business that deliv-
ers groceries and runs errands for busy people or older and disabled people
who can’t easily perform daily tasks for themselves.
288
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

Delineate the steps that you will take to provide the service. When potential
customers call you to inquire about your business, what kinds of information
do you want to record about their situation? Create a pricing sheet and other
marketing literature (discussed in the next section) that you can mail curious
customers.
After someone calls and says, “I want to hire you,” you need to collect more
details. Try drawing up an information sheet that prompts you for the infor-
mation that you need (for example, address, promised delivery time, desired
items, and so on).
If you want to be a tax preparer, you need forms or a filing system to give to
your customers to help them organize the information that they give to you.
The point of these examples is that you need to map out a system that you
can work with before you dive into running your business. Your system may
evolve over time — you can be guaranteed of that — but a tentative game
plan has great value.
If you want to manufacture a product, you definitely need to scope out the
process that you’re going to use. Otherwise, you have no idea how much time
the manufacturing process may take or what the process may cost.
As your business grows and you hire employees to provide services or create
your products, the more you codify what you do, and the better your employ-
ees can replicate your good work.
Marketing your service or product
After you get more in-depth information about your company’s services or
products, you need to find more specific information about the following:
 How much will you charge for your services and products? Look at
what competing products and services cost. Also, estimating your costs
helps you figure out what you need to charge to cover your costs and
make a reasonable profit.
 How will you position your product and services versus the competi-
tion? Remember the local pet supply store example that I mention ear-
lier in this chapter? It positions itself as a convenient store equipped
with a broad selection and knowledgeable customer assistance. Books
similarly position themselves in the book marketplace. I hope, in your
mind, that my financial books are down-to-earth, practical, answer-
oriented, and educational.
289
Chapter 13: Evaluating Your Entrepreneurial Ambitions

 Where will you sell your product or service? Business consultants
label this decision the distribution channel question. For example, if
you’re going to go into the hula hoop manufacturing business, you may
consider selling via mail order and the Internet, through toy stores, or
through discount warehouse stores. Selling through each of these differ-
ent distribution channels requires unique marketing and advertising pro-
grams. If you market a product or service to companies, you need to find
out who the key decision makers are at the company and what will con-
vince them to buy your product or service.
Having a great product or service isn’t enough if you keep it a secret — you
gotta get the word out. It’s doubtful that you have the budget or want to
reach the same region that television and radio reach.
Start marketing your product to people who you know. Develop a punchy,
informative one-page letter that announces your company’s inception and
the products or services it offers, and mail it to your contacts. Include an
envelope with a reply form that allows recipients to provide the addresses of
others who may be interested in what you have to offer. Send these folks a
mailing as well, referencing who passed their name along to you.
Finding and retaining customers is vital to any business that wants to grow and
be profitable. One simple, inexpensive way to stay in touch with customers
you’ve dealt with or others who have made inquiries and expressed interest
in your company’s offerings is via a mailing list. Once a quarter, once a year,
or whatever makes sense for your business, send out a simple, professional-
looking postcard or newsletter announcing new information about your busi-
ness and what customer needs you can fulfill. Such mailings also allow you to
remind people that you’re still in business and that you provide a wonderful
product or service. Computer software gives you a fast, efficient way to keep
a customer mailing list up to date and to print mailing labels.
E-mailing this information has the attraction of no out-of-pocket expenses.
However, due to the deluge of junk e-mail most people get, your e-mail is
likely to be deleted without being opened. At least a snail-mailed postcard
will get prospective customers’ attention, even if only for a brief period.
Organizing and staffing your business
Many small businesses are one-person operations. So much the better for
you — you have none of the headaches of hiring, payroll, and so on. You only
have to worry about you — and that may be a handful in itself!
290
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

But if you desire to manage the work being done instead of doing all the work
yourself, and if you hope to grow your business, you’ll eventually want to hire
people. (I explain the best way to fill your personnel needs in Chapter 14.) If
hiring is your goal, give some thought now to the skills and functional areas of
expertise that future hires need. If you want to raise money, the employment
section of your business plan is essential to show your investors that you’re
planning long-term.
Maybe you’ll want an administrative assistant, researcher, marketing person,
or sales representative. What about a training specialist, finance person, or
real estate person if your company expands? Consider the background that
you desire in those you hire, and look at the types of people that similar com-
panies select and hire.
You should also consider what legal form of organization — for example, a
sole proprietorship, partnership, S corporation, limited liability company,
and so on — your business will adopt. I address this topic in Chapter 14.
Projecting finances
An idea often becomes a bad idea or a business failure if you neglect to con-
sider, or are unrealistic about, the financial side of the business that you want
to start. If you’re a creative or people-person type who hates numbers, the
financial side may be the part of the business plan that you most want to
avoid. Don’t — doing so can cost you tens of thousands of dollars in avoid-
able mistakes. Ignoring the financial side can even lead to the bankruptcy of
a business founded with a good idea.
Before you launch your business, you should do enough research so that you
can come up with some decent financial estimates to address these issues.
Financial projections are mandatory, and knowledgeable investors will scruti-
nize them if you seek outside money. You also need to think through how and
when investors can cash out.
Start-up and development costs
Spending money to get your business from the idea stage to an operating
enterprise is inevitable. Before the revenue begins to flow in, you’ll incur
expenditures as you develop and market your products and services.
Therefore, you need to understand what you must spend money on and the
approximate timing of the needed purchases.
291
Chapter 13: Evaluating Your Entrepreneurial Ambitions

If you were going to build a house, you would develop a list of all the required
costs. How much are the land, construction, carpeting, landscaping, and so
on going to cost? You can try to develop all these cost estimates yourself,
or you can speak with local builders and have them help you. Likewise, with
your business, you can hire a business consultant who knows something
about your type of business. However, I think you’re best served by doing
the homework yourself — you discover a lot more, and it’s cheaper.
If you’re going to work in an office setting, at home or in outside space, you
need furniture (such as a desk, chair, filing cabinets, and so on), a computer,
printer, and other office supplies. Don’t forget to factor in the costs of any
licenses or government registrations that you may need.
If you run a retailing operation, you need to also estimate your initial inven-
tory costs. Remember, selling your inventory takes time, especially when you
first start up. And as a new business, suppliers won’t give you months on end
to pay for your initial inventory. Be realistic — otherwise, the money that you
tie up in inventory can send you to financial ruin.
Income statement
Preparing an estimated income statement that summarizes your expected rev-
enue and expenses is a challenging and important part of your business plan.
(I explain the elements of an income statement in Chapter 6.) Preparing an
income statement is difficult because of all the estimates and assumptions
that go into it. As you prepare your estimated income statement, you may
discover that making a decent profit is tougher than you thought. This sec-
tion of your business plan helps you make pricing decisions.
Consider the Vet on Wheels business idea that I discuss in the “Identifying
your business concept” section, earlier in this chapter. What range of veteri-
nary services can you provide if you make house calls? You can’t perform all
the services that you can in a larger office setting. What equipment do you
need to perform the services? How much should you charge for the services?
You need to estimate all these things to develop a worthwhile income state-
ment. You should be able to answer these questions from the insights and
information you pulled together regarding what customers want and what
your competitors are offering.
With service businesses in which you or your employees sell your time, be
realistic about how many hours you can bill. You may end up being able to
bill only a third to half of your time, given the other management activities
that you need to perform.
292
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

Because building a customer base takes several years, try to prepare esti-
mated income statements for the first three years. In the earlier years, you
have more start-up costs. In later years, you reap more profits as your cus-
tomer rolls expand. Doing income statements over several years is also
essential if you’re seeking investor money.
Balance sheet
An income statement measures the profitability of a business over a span of
time, such as a year, but it tells you nothing of a business’s resources and oblig-
ations. That’s what a balance sheet does. Just as your personal balance sheet
itemizes your personal assets (for example, investments) and liabilities (debts
you owe), a business balance sheet details a company’s assets and liabilities.
If you operate a cash business — you provide a service and are paid for that
service, and you don’t hold any inventory, for example — a balance sheet has
limited use. An exception is if you’re trying to get a bank loan for your service
business.
A complete balance sheet isn’t as important as tracking the available cash,
which will be under pressure in the early years of a business because
expenses can continue to exceed revenue for quite some time.
A complete balance sheet is useful for a business that owns significant equip-
ment, furniture, inventory, and so on. The asset side of the balance sheet 
provides insight into the financial staying power of the company. For exam-
ple, how much cash does your business have on hand to meet expected
short-term bills? Conversely, the liability side of the ledger indicates the
obligations, bills, and debts the company has coming due in the short and
long term.
See Chapter 6 for more information on all the elements of a balance sheet.
Writing an executive summary
An executive summary is a two- to three-page summary of your entire busi-
ness plan that you can share with interested investors who may not want to
first wade through a 40- to 50-page plan. The executive summary whets the
prospective investor’s appetite by touching on the highlights of your entire
plan. Because this summary should go in the front of your plan document,
you may find it odd that I list this element last. I have a reason for doing so:
You’re not going to be able to write an intelligent summary of your plan until
you flesh out the body of your business plan.

 Keeping track of the money
A
fter you research and evaluate the needs of your business, at some point
you need to decide whether to actually start your business. In reference
to his business plan, Alex Popov, founder of Smart Alec’s, a healthy fast-food
restaurant, says, “Something just clicked one day, and I said to myself, ‘Yes,
this is a business that is viable and appropriate now.’ “
Most entrepreneurs experience this sudden realization, including me — I’ve
experienced it with every business that I’ve ever started. If you really want
to, you can conduct and analyze market research and crunch numbers until
the cows come home. Even if you’re a linear, logical, analytic, quantitative
kind of person, you need to make a gut-level decision in the final analysis: Do
you want to jump in the water and start swimming, or do you want to stay on
the sidelines and remain a spectator? In my opinion, watching isn’t nearly as
fun as doing. If you feel ready but have some trepidation, you’re normal —
just go for it!
Starting Up: Your Preflight Check List
When you decide to take off into the world of small business ownership, you
also need to ponder and make some decisions about a number of important
issues. Just like a pilot before she launches an airplane into flight, you need

to make sure that all systems are in order and ready to do the job. If your fuel
tanks aren’t adequately filled, your engines clean and in working order, and
your wing flaps in the proper position, you may never get your business off
the ground.
Preparing to leave your job
The top reasons that wannabe entrepreneurs remain wannabe entrepreneurs
are the psychological and financial aspects. Money and mind issues cause
many aspiring entrepreneurs to remain their employers’ indentured servants
and cause those who do break free to soon return to their bondage. You may
never discover that you have the talent to run your own business, and per-
haps have a good idea to boot, unless you prepare yourself fiscally and emo-
tionally to leave your job.
The money side of this self-exploration is easier to deal with than your mind,
so I’ll start with that. Dealing with a net reduction in the income that you
bring home from work — at least in the early years of your business — is a
foregone conclusion for the vast majority of small-business opportunities
that you may pursue. Accept this fact and plan accordingly.
Do all that you can to reduce your expenses to a level that fits the entrepre-
neurial life that you want to lead. You must examine your monthly spending
patterns now to make your budget lean, mean, and entrepreneurially friendly.
Determine what you spend each month on your rent (or mortgage), gro-
ceries, eating out, telephone calls, insurance, and so on. Unless you’re one of
those organized computer geeks — someone who keeps all this data detailed
in a software package — you need to whip out your checkbook register, ATM
receipts, credit card statement, and anything else that documents your
spending habits. Don’t forget to estimate your cash purchases that don’t
leave a trail, like when you eat lunch out or spend $35 on gas.
Don’t tell me that everything you spend your money on is a necessity and
that you can’t cut anywhere. Question your expenditures! If you don’t, contin-
uing to work as an employee will be a necessity, and you’ll never be able to
pursue your entrepreneurial dream.
Beyond the bare essentials of food, shelter, health care, and clothing, most of
what you spend money on is discretionary — that is, you spend money on lux-
uries. Even the amount that you spend on the necessities, such as food and
shelter, is probably only part necessity and may include a fair amount of
luxury and waste. If you need a helping hand and an analyst’s eye in preparing
and developing strategies for reducing your spending, pick up a copy of the
latest edition of my book, Personal Finance For Dummies (published by Wiley).
296
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

Reduce your expenses to the level that they were when you lived at home
or when you were a college student — remember those enjoyable days?
Spending more doesn’t make you happy; you’ll be miserable over the years
if your excess spending makes you feel chained to a job you don’t like. Life
is too short to spend most of it working at a full-time job that makes you
unhappy.
If reducing your spending is the most important financial move you can make
before and during the period that you start your business, the second-best
thing you can do is to spend some time figuring how you’ll manage the
income side of your personal finances. The following list gives you some
proven strategies to ensure that you earn enough income to live on:
 Transition gradually. One way to pursue your entrepreneurial dreams
(and not starve while doing so) is to continue working part time in a reg-
ular job while you work part time at your own business. If you have a job
that allows you to work part time, seize the opportunity. Some employ-
ers may even allow you to maintain your benefits.
In addition to ensuring a steady source of income, splitting your time
allows you to adjust to a completely new way of making a living. Some
people have a hard time adjusting to their new lifestyle if they quit their
jobs cold turkey and plunge headfirst into full-time entrepreneurship.
Another option is to completely leave your job but line up a chunk of
work that provides a decent income for at least some of your weekly work
hours. Consulting for your old employer is a time-tested first “entrepre-
neurial” option with low risk.
 Get/stay married. Actually, as long as you’re attached to someone who
maintains a regular job and you manage your spending so that you can
live on that person’s income alone, you’re golden! Just make sure that
you talk things through with the love of your life to minimize misunder-
standings and resentments. Maybe someday you can return the favor —
that’s what my wife and I did. She was working in education (no big
bucks there!) when I started an entrepreneurial venture after business
school. We lived a Spartan lifestyle and made do just fine on her income.
Several years later, when things were going swimmingly for me, she left
her job to work on her own business.
Valuing and replacing your benefits
Part of the money dilemmas that you may encounter deal with the benefits that
your employer provides. For many people, walking away from these benefits is
both financially and psychologically challenging. Benefits are valuable, but you
may be surprised by how quickly you can replicate them in your own business.
297
Chapter 14: Starting and Running Your Own Small Business

Health insurance
Some prospective entrepreneurs fret over finding new health insurance. Unless
you have a significant existing medical problem (known as a pre-existing 
condition), getting health insurance as an individual isn’t difficult.
The first option to explore is whether your existing coverage through your
employer’s group plan can be converted into individual coverage. Just don’t
act on this potentially attractive option until you’ve explored other health
plans on your own, which may offer similar benefits at lower cost. Also, get
proposals for individual coverage from major health plans in your area. Take
a high deductible, if available, to keep costs down.
Government regulations called COBRA require an employer with 20 or more
employees to continue your health insurance coverage (at your own
expense) for up to 18 months after you terminate employment. Moreover, if
you have or develop a health problem while covered under COBRA, the law
enables you to purchase an individual policy at the same price that a healthy
individual can. These laws create a nice buffer zone for the budding entrepre-
neur, but don’t get lazy and wait until the last minute of the 18th month to
start shopping for your individual plan — COBRA plans can be costly.
Shopping around and locking in an individual plan as soon as possible can
save money and prevent headaches.
Long-term disability insurance
For most people, their greatest asset is their ability to earn money. If you
suffer a disability and can’t work, how would you manage financially? Long-
term disability insurance protects your income in the event of a disability.
Before you leave your job, secure an individual long-term disability policy.
After you leave your job and are no longer earning steady income, you won’t
qualify for a policy. Most insurers want to see at least six months of self-
employment income before they’ll write you a policy. If you become disabled
during this time, you’re uninsured and out of luck — that’s a big risk to take!
Check with any professional associations that you belong to or could join to
see whether they offer long-term disability plans. As with many employer-
based programs, association plans are sometimes less expensive because of
the group’s purchasing power.
Life insurance
If you have dependents who count on your income, you need life insurance.
And unlike with disability insurance, in the vast majority of cases, you can
purchase a life insurance policy at a lower cost than you can purchase addi-
tional coverage through your employer.
298
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

Retirement plans
If your employer offers retirement savings programs, such as a 401(k) plan or
a pension plan, don’t despair about not having these in the future. (Of course,
what you’ve already earned and accumulated while employed is yours.) One
of the best benefits of self-employment is retirement savings plans — SEP-IRAs
(Simplified Employee Pension Individual Retirement Accounts) and Keoghs —
that allow you to sock away a hefty chunk of your earnings on a tax-deductible
basis.
Retirement plans are a terrific way for you and your employees to shield a
large portion of earnings from taxation. If you don’t have employees, regu-
larly contributing to one of these plans is usually a no-brainer. With employ-
ees, the decision is a bit more complicated but often still a great idea. Small
businesses with a number of employees can also consider 401(k) plans. I
explain retirement plans in Chapter 3.
Other benefits
Yes, employers offer other benefits that you may value. For example, you seem
to get paid holidays and vacations. In reality, though, your employer simply
spreads your salary over all 52 weeks of a year, thus paying you for actually
working the other 47 weeks or so out of the year. You can do the same by
building the cost of this paid time off into your product and service pricing.
Another “benefit” of working for an employer is that the employer pays for
half (7.65 percent) of your Social Security and Medicare taxes. Although you
must pay the entire tax (15.3 percent) when you’re self-employed, the IRS
allows you to take half of this amount as a tax deduction on your annual tax
Form 1040, so that tax isn’t as painful as you think. As with vacations and hol-
idays, you can build the cost of this tax into your product and service pric-
ing. Just think: Your employer could pay you a higher salary if it weren’t
paying half of these taxes as a benefit.
Some employers offer other insurance plans, such as dental or vision care
plans. Ultimately, these plans cover small out-of-pocket expenditures that
aren’t worth insuring for. Don’t waste your money purchasing such policies
when you’re self-employed.
Financing Your Business
When you create your business plan (which I explain how to do in Chapter
13), you should estimate your start-up and development costs. You can start
many worthwhile small businesses with little capital. The following sections
explain methods for financing your business.
299
Chapter 14: Starting and Running Your Own Small Business

Bootstrapping
Making do with a small amount of capital and spending it as you can afford to
is known as bootstrapping. Bootstrapping is just a fancy way of saying that a
business lives within its means. This forces a business to be more resourceful
and less wasteful. Bootstrapping is also a great training mechanism for pro-
ducing cost-effective products and services. It offers you the advantage of
getting into business in the first place with little capital.
Millions of successful small companies were bootstrapped at one time or
another. Like small redwood saplings that grow into towering trees, small
companies that had to bootstrap in the past can eventually grow into hun-
dred million- and even multibillion-dollar companies. For example, Ross Perot
started EDS with a mere $1,000, and Hewlett-Packard’s founders started their
company out of a garage in Palo Alto, California. Motorola, Sony, and Disney
were all bootstrapped, too.
Whether you want to maintain a small shop that employs just yourself, hire a
few employees, or dream about building the next large company, you need
capital. However, misconceptions abound about how much money a com-
pany needs to achieve its goals and sources of funding.
“There’s an illusion that most companies need tons of money to get established
and grow,” says James Collins, former lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School
of Business and co-author of the best-sellers Built to Last and Good to Great:
Why Some Companies Make the Leap . . . and Others Don’t. “The Silicon Valley
success stories of companies that raise gobs of venture capital and grow 4,000
percent are very rare. They are statistically insignificant but catch all sorts of
attention,” he adds.
Studies show that the vast majority of small businesses obtain their initial
capital from personal savings and family and friends rather than outside
sources, such as banks and venture capital firms. A Harvard Business School
study of the Inc. 500 (500 large, fast-growing private companies) found that
more than 80 percent of the successful companies were started with funds
from the founder’s personal savings. The median start-up capital was a
modest $10,000, and these are successful, fast-growing companies! Slower-
growing companies tend to require even less capital.
With the initial infusion of capital, many small businesses can propel them-
selves for years after they develop a service or product that brings in more
cash flow. Jim Gentes, the founder of Giro, the bike helmet manufacturer,
raised just $35,000 from personal savings and loans from family and friends
to make and distribute his first product and then used the cash flow for
future products.

Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

Eventually, a successful, growing company may want outside financing to
expand faster. Raising money from investors or lenders is much easier after
you demonstrate that you know what you’re doing and that a market exists
for your product or service.
As I explain in the section “Preparing to leave your job,” earlier in this chap-
ter, aspiring entrepreneurs must examine their personal finances for opportu-
nities to reduce their own spending. If you want to start a company, the best
time for you to examine your finances is years before you want to hit the
entrepreneurial path. As with other financial goals, advance preparation can
go a long way toward helping start a business. The best funding source and
easiest investor to please is you.
Alan Tripp, founder and CEO of Score Learning, a chain of storefront interac-
tive learning centers, planned for seven years before he took the entrepre-
neurial plunge. He funded his first retail center fully from personal savings.
He and his wife lived frugally to save the necessary money. Tripp’s first
center proved the success of his business concept: retail learning centers
where kids can use computers to improve their reading, math, and science
skills. With a business plan crafted over time and hard numbers to demon-
strate the financial viability of his operation, Tripp then successfully raised
funds from investors to open many more centers. (Kaplan, Inc., ultimately
bought out his company.)
Some small-business founders put the cart before the horse and don’t plan
and save for starting their business the way that Tripp did. And in many cases,
small-business owners want capital but don’t have a clear plan or need for it.
Borrowing from banks
If you’re starting a new business or have been in business for just a few years,
borrowing, particularly from banks, may be difficult. Borrowing money is
easier when you don’t really need to do so. No one knows this fact better
than small-business owners do.
Small-business owners who successfully obtain bank loans do their home-
work. To borrow money from a bank, you generally need a business plan,
three years of financial statements and tax returns for the business and its
owner, as well as projections for the business. Hunt around for banks that are
committed to and understand the small-business marketplace.
The Small Business Administration (SBA) guarantees some small-business
loans that banks originate. Because many small businesses lack collateral
and pose a higher loan risk, banks would not otherwise make many of these
loans. The SBA, in addition to guaranteeing loans for existing businesses,
301
Chapter 14: Starting and Running Your Own Small Business

grants about 20 percent of its loans to start-up businesses, which must have
founders who put up at least a third of the funds needed and demonstrate a
thorough understanding of the business, ideally through prior related indus-
try experience.
The SBA offers a number of workshops and counseling services for small
business owners. Its SCORE (Service Corps of Retired Executives) consulting
services provide free advice and critiques of business plans, as well as advice
on raising money for your business. The SBA charges a nominal fee for semi-
nars. To get more information on SBA’s services and how to contact a local
office, call 800-827-5722 or visit its Web site at www.sba.gov.
Credit unions can be another source of financial help. They’re often more
willing to make personal loans to individuals.
Borrowing against the equity in your home or other real estate is also advan-
tageous because real estate loans generally entail lower and tax-deductible
interest.
You can use retirement savings plans as another potential source of capital.
You may be able to borrow against your investment balance, and such loans
are usually available at competitive rates through employer-based plans. Just
make sure that you don’t take on too much debt and jeopardize your retire-
ment savings.
If you’ve got the itch to get your business going but can’t wait to save the
necessary money and lack other ways to borrow, the plastic in your wallet
may be your ticket to operation. You can acquire some credit cards at inter-
est rates of 10 percent or less. Because credit cards are unsecured loans, if
your business fails and you can’t pay back your debt, your home equity and
assets in retirement accounts aren’t at risk.
No matter what type of business you have in mind and how much money you
think you need to make it succeed, be patient. Start small enough that you
don’t need outside capital (unless you’re in an unusual situation where your
window of opportunity is now, but it will close if you don’t get funding soon).
Starting your business without outside capital instills the discipline required
for building a business piece by piece over time. The longer you can wait to
get a loan or an equity investment, the better the terms are for you and your
business because the risk is lower for the lender or investor.
Borrowing from family and friends
Because they know you and hopefully like and trust you, your family and
friends may seem like a good source of investment money for your small
business. They also have the added advantage of offering you better terms
than a banker, wealthy investor, or a venture capitalist.
302
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

Before you solicit and accept money from those you love, consider the pit-
falls. First, defaulting on a loan made by a large, anonymous lender if your
business hits the skids is one thing, but defaulting on a loan from your dear
relatives can make future Thanksgiving meals mighty uncomfortable!
Second, most entrepreneurs receive surprisingly little encouragement from
people that they’re close to. Most parents, for example, think that you’ve sev-
ered some of your cerebral synapses if you announce your intention to quit
your job with lofty job title, decent pay, and benefits. The lack of emotional
support can discourage you far more than the lack of financial support.
From entrepreneurs I’ve observed, family investments in a small business
work best under the following conditions:
 You prepare and sign a letter of agreement that spells out the terms
of the investment or loan, as if you’re doing business with a banker
or some other investor you know for business purposes only. As time
goes on, people have selective recall. Putting things in writing reminds
everyone what was agreed to.
 You’re quite certain that you can repay the loan.
 You can start your business with an equity investment. With an equity
investment, a person is willing and able to lose all the money invested
but hopes to hit a home run while helping you with your dream.
Courting investors and selling equity
Beyond family members and friends, private individuals with sufficient
money — also known as wealthy individuals — are your next best source of
capital if you want an equity investor (and not a loan from a lender). Before
you approach wealthy people, you must have a good business plan, which I
explain how to prepare in Chapter 13.
Although you want such people to care about your business, it’s best if their
investment in your business is no more than 5 to 10 percent of their total
investment portfolio. No one wants to lose money, but doing so is less painful if
you diversify well. A $10,000 loan from a millionaire is 1 percent of his portfolio.
Finding people who may be interested in investing isn’t difficult, but you need
to be persistent and creative. Consider these approaches:
 Consulting tax advisors and attorneys you know may have contacts.
 Networking with successful entrepreneurs in similar fields.
 Considering customers or suppliers of your business who like your busi-
ness and believe in its potential.
303
Chapter 14: Starting and Running Your Own Small Business

Finding your way to wealthy individuals who don’t know you may prove fruitful
as well. Alex Popov, whom I introduce at the beginning of this chapter, sent
hundreds of letters to people who lived in upscale neighborhoods. The letter, a
one-page summary of Alex’s investment opportunity, got an astounding 5 per-
cent response for interest in receiving a business plan. Ultimately through this
search method, Popov found one wealthy investor who funded his entire deal.
Determining how much of the business you’re selling for the amount invested
isn’t easy. Basically, the equity percentage should hinge upon what the whole
business is worth (see Chapter 15 for details on how to value a business). If
your whole business is worth $500,000 and you’re seeking $100,000 from
investors, that $100,000 should buy 20 percent of the business.
New businesses are the hardest to value — yet another reason you’re best off
trying to raise money after you demonstrate some success. The farther along
you are, the lower the risk to an investor and the lower the cost to you (in
terms of how much equity you must give up) to raise money.
Deciding Whether to Incorporate
Most businesses operate as sole proprietorships. Sole proprietorship status is
limited to one owner or a married couple. If you run a sole proprietorship,
you report your business income and costs on your tax return on Schedule C
(Profit or Loss From Business), which you attach to your personal income tax
return, Form 1040. Incorporating, which establishes a distinct legal entity
under which you do business, takes time and costs money. Therefore, incor-
poration must offer some benefits.
Because corporations are legal entities distinct from their owners, they offer
features that a proprietorship or partnership doesn’t. For example, corpora-
tions can have shareholders who own a piece or percentage of the company.
These shares can be sold or transferred to other owners, subject to any
restrictions in the shareholder’s agreement. Corporations also offer continuity
of life, which simply means that they can continue to exist despite an owner’s
death or the owner’s transfer of her stock in the company. In the following
sections, I detail the other benefits, along with possible drawbacks, of incor-
porating on the way to helping you decide whether incorporating is the right
choice for you.
Don’t waste your money incorporating if you simply want to maintain a 
corporate-sounding name. If you operate as a sole proprietor, you can choose
to operate under a different business name (“doing business as,” or d.b.a.)
without the cost and hassles of incorporating.
304
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

Liability protection
A major reason to consider incorporation is liability protection. Incorporation
effectively separates your business from your personal finances, thereby
better protecting your personal assets from lawsuits that may arise from your
business.
Before you incorporate, ask yourself (and perhaps others in your line of busi-
ness or advisors — legal, tax, and so on — who work with businesses like
yours) what can or may cause someone to sue you. Then see whether you
can purchase insurance to protect against these potential liabilities. Insurance
is superior to incorporation because it pays claims, and people can still sue
you, even if you’re incorporated. If you incorporate and someone successfully
sues you, your company must cough up the money for the claim, and doing so
may sink your business. Only insurance can cover such financially destructive
claims.
People can also sue you if, for example, they slip and suffer an injury while on
your property. To cover these types of claims, you can purchase a property
or premises liability policy from an insurer.
Accountants, doctors, and a number of other professionals can buy liability
insurance. A good place to start searching for liability insurance is through
the associations for your profession. Even if you’re not a current member,
check out the associations anyway — you may be able to access the insur-
ance without membership, or you can join the association long enough to
sign up. (Associations also sometimes offer competitive rates on disability
insurance.)
Tax-deductible insurance 
and other benefits
A variety of insurance and related benefits are tax-deductible to corporations
for all employees. These benefits include the full cost of health and disability
insurance as well as up to $50,000 in term life insurance per employee.
In addition to insurance, companies that incorporate can also have dependent-
care plans in which up to $5,000 per employee may be put away on a tax-
deductible basis for child care and/or care for elderly parents. Corporations
can also offer cafeteria or flexible spending plans that allow employees to pick
and choose which benefits they spend their benefit dollars on.
305
Chapter 14: Starting and Running Your Own Small Business

If your business isn’t incorporated, you and the other business owner(s)
can’t deduct the cost of the preceding insurance plans for yourselves.
However, you can deduct these costs for your employees as well as your
health insurance costs for yourself and covered family members.
Corporate taxes
Aside from the tax treatment of insurance and other benefits, another differ-
ence between operating as a sole proprietor and as a corporation is that
the government taxes a corporation’s profits differently than those realized
in a sole proprietorship. Which is better for your business depends on your
situation.
306
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
S corporations and limited liability companies:
The best of both worlds?
Wouldn’t it be nice to get the liability protection
and other benefits that come with incorporating
without the tax complications and hassles?
Well, S corporations or limited liability compa-
nies may be for you.
Subchapter S corporations provide the liability
protection that comes with incorporation.
Likewise, the business profit or loss passes
through to the owner’s personal tax return, so if
the business shows a loss in some years, the
owner may claim those losses in the current
year of the loss on his personal tax return. If you
plan to take all the profits out of the company
(instead of reinvesting them), an S corporation
may make sense for you.
The IRS allows most small businesses to operate
as S corporations, but not all. In order to be an S
corporation, a company must be a U.S. company,
have just one class of stock, and have no more
than 35 shareholders, who are all U.S. residents
or citizens and who are not partnerships, corpo-
rations, or (with certain exceptions) trusts.
Limited liability companies (LLCs) offer business
owners benefits similar to those of S corpora-
tions but are even better in some cases. Like an
S corporation, an LLC offers liability protection
for the owners. LLCs also pass the business’s
profits and losses through to the owner’s per-
sonal income tax returns.
But limited liability companies have fewer
restrictions regarding shareholders. For exam-
ple, LLCs have no limits on the number of share-
holders, and the shareholders in an LLC can be
foreigners, corporations, and partnerships.
Compared with S corporations, the only addi-
tional restriction LLCs carry is that sole propri-
etors and professionals can’t always form an
LLC (although they can in some states). Most
state laws require you to have at least two part-
ners and not be a professional service firm (for
example, accounting, legal, or medical).

Suppose that your business performs well and makes lots of money. If your
business isn’t incorporated, the government taxes all profits from your busi-
ness on your personal tax return in the year that your company earns those
profits. If you intend to use these profits to reinvest in your business and
expand, incorporating can potentially save you some tax dollars (this doesn’t
work for personal service corporations, such as accounting, legal, and med-
ical firms, which pay a higher tax rate).
Resist the short-term temptation to incorporate just so that you can have
money left in the corporation taxed at a lower rate. If you want to pay 
yourself the profits in the future, you can end up paying more taxes. Why?
Because you first pay taxes at the corporate tax rate in the year that your
company earns the money, and then you pay taxes again on your personal
income tax return when the corporation pays you.
Another reason not to incorporate, especially in the early months of a busi-
ness, is that you can’t immediately claim the losses for an incorporated 
business on your personal tax return. Because most businesses produce
little revenue in their early years and have all sorts of start-up expenditures,
losses are common.
Making the decision
If you’re totally confused about whether to incorporate because your busi-
ness is undergoing major financial changes, it’s worth getting competent pro-
fessional help. The hard part is knowing where to turn, because finding one
advisor who can put together all the pieces of the puzzle (financial, legal, and
taxes) is challenging. Also be aware that you may get wrong or biased advice.
Although most attorneys and tax advisors don’t understand the business
side of business, try to find one who does, or you may also need a business
advisor. Attorneys who specialize in advising small businesses can help
explain the legal issues. Tax advisors who perform a lot of work with busi-
ness owners can help explain the tax considerations.
If you’ve weighed the factors and you still can’t decide, my advice is to keep
your business simple — don’t incorporate. Why? Because after you incorpo-
rate, unincorporating takes time and money. Start off your business as a sole
proprietorship and then take it from there. Wait until the benefits of incorpo-
rating your business clearly outweigh the costs and drawbacks.
307
Chapter 14: Starting and Running Your Own Small Business

Finding and Keeping Customers
When you write your business plan (see Chapter 13), you need to think about
your business’s customers. Just as the sun is the center of our solar system,
everything in your business revolves around your customers. If you take care
of your customers, they’ll take care of you and your business for many years.
The first thing I recommend doing is putting together a mailing list of people
you know who may be interested in what you’re offering. Draft and mail an
upbeat, one-page letter that provides an overview of what your business
offers. As you have news — successes to report, new products and services,
and so on — do another mailing. Short letters get read more than something
that looks like another glossy advertising newsletter. Most people are busy
and don’t care about your business enough to read something lengthy.
In addition to mailings, other successful ways to get the word out and attract
customers are limited only to your imagination and resourcefulness.
Consider the following ideas:
 If your business idea is indeed innovative or somehow different, or if
you have grand expansion plans, add some local media people to your
mailing list and send them the one-page updates on your business, too.
Newspaper, radio, and even television business reporters are always
looking for story ideas. Just remember to make your press releases
informational and not an advertisement.
 If your business seeks customers in a specific geographic area, blanket
that area by mailing your one-page letter or delivering it door to door.
You can include a coupon that offers your products or services at a
reduced cost (perhaps at your cost) to get people to try them. Make sure
that people know that this is a special opening-for-business bargain.
After you attract customers, don’t treat them as if business is a one-night
stand. Treat your customers as you would like to be treated by a business. If
customers like your products and services, they not only come back to buy
more when the need arises, but they also tell others. Satisfied customers are
every business’s best cost-effective marketers.
I never cease to be amazed by how many businesses have mediocre or poor
customer service. One reason for poor service is that as your business
grows, your employees are on the customer service front lines. If you don’t
hire good people and give them the proper incentives to service customers,
many of them won’t do it. For most employees on a salary, the day-to-day ser-
vicing of customers may be just an annoyance for them.
308
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

One way to make your staff care about customer service is to base part of
their pay on the satisfaction of the customers they work with. Tie bonuses
and increases at review time to this issue. You can easily measure customer
satisfaction with a simple survey form.
Think about your own experiences with poor customer service. For example,
not having a green thumb, I hired a gardening company to install a garden.
The company did a decent job in the early days of the project and expressed
interest in providing ongoing maintenance. Within days of the garden installa-
tion, some problems (minor from my perspective) surfaced. A large jasmine
vine that had survived for more than a year under my care started to die a
few days after the new garden was installed. One worker thought that the
vine could be dying because some roots were inadvertently cut during instal-
lation, but no one ever came out to look at the vine or suggest what to do. A
number of plants were poorly placed and quickly encroached onto the lawn.
Again and again I asked someone to come out and take a look, but no one did.
Unfortunately, I figured out that because I had already paid for the job, the
company wasn’t interested in addressing the problems. Even though the com-
pany’s workers did a good job with the project overall, the lack of follow-up
left a bad taste in my mouth and caused me to not recommend the company.
Treating the customer right starts the moment that the selling process
begins. Honesty is an often-underused business tool. More than a few sales-
people mislead and lie in order to close a sale. Many customers discover
after their purchase that they’ve been deceived, and they get angry. These
unethical businesses not only likely lose future business from customers but
also surely — and justifiably — lose referrals.
If your business doesn’t perform well for a customer, apologize and bend
over backward to make the customer happy. Offer a discount on the problem
purchase or, if possible, a refund on product purchases. Also, make sure that
you have a clear return-and-refund policy. Bend that policy if doing so helps
you satisfy an unhappy customer or rids you of a difficult customer.
Setting Up Shop
No matter what type of business you have in mind, you need space to work
from, whether it’s a spare room in your home, shared office space, or a small
factory. You also need to outfit that space with tools of your trade. This sec-
tion explains how to tackle these tasks.
309
Chapter 14: Starting and Running Your Own Small Business

Finding business space
and negotiating a lease
You may be in the market for office or retail space unless you can run your
business from your home. Finding good space and buying or leasing it take
tons of time if you do it right.
In the early months and years of your business, buying an office or a retail
building generally doesn’t make sense. The down payment consumes impor-
tant capital, and you may end up spending lots of time and money on a real
estate transaction for a location that may not interest you in the long term.
Buying this type of real estate rarely makes sense unless you plan to stay put
for five or more years.
Leasing a space for your business is far more practical. Renting office space is
simpler than renting retail space because a building owner worries less about
your business and its financial health. Your business needs more credibility to
rent retail because your retail business affects the nature of the strip mall or
shopping center where you lease. Owners of such properties don’t want quick
failures or someone who does a poor job of running his business.
Because renting retail space is harder, if you and your business don’t have a
track record with renting space, getting references is useful. If you seek well-
located retail space, you must compete with national chains like Starbucks, so
you’d better have an A+ credit rating and track record. Consider subletting —
circulate flyers to businesses that may have some extra space in the area
where you want to locate your business. Also prepare financial statements
that show your creditworthiness (personally and in business).
Brokers list most spaces for lease. Working with a broker can be useful, but
the same conflicts exist as with residential brokers (see Chapter 12). You
should also examine spaces for lease without a broker, where you deal with
the landlord directly. Such landlords may give you a better deal, and they
don’t worry about recouping a brokerage commission.
The biggest headaches with leasing space are understanding and negotiating
the lease contract. Odds are that the lessor presents you with a standard,
preprinted lease contract that she says is fair and the same lease that every-
one else signs. Don’t sign it! This contract is the lessor’s first offer — have an
expert review it and help you modify it. Find yourself an attorney who regu-
larly deals with such contracts.
310
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

Office leases are usually simpler than retail leases. About the most complicated
issue you face with office leases is that they can be full service, which includes
janitorial benefits. Retail leases, however, are always triple-net, which means
that you as the tenant pay for maintenance (for example, resurfacing the park-
ing lot, cleaning, and gardening), utilities, and property taxes. You’re correct to
worry about a triple-net retail lease because you can’t control many of these
expenses. For example, if the property is sold, property taxes can jump. Here
are provisions to keep in mind when dealing with a triple-net lease:
311
Chapter 14: Starting and Running Your Own Small Business
Should you work from home?
You may be able to run a relatively simple small
business from your home. If you have the
choice of running your business out of your
home versus securing outside office space,
consider the following issues:
 Cost control: As I discuss earlier in the
chapter, bootstrapping your business can
make a lot of financial and business sense.
If you have space in your home that you can
use, then you’ve found yourself a rent-free
business space. (If you’re considering
buying a larger home to have more space,
then you can’t really say that your home
office is rent-free.)
 Business issues: What are the needs of
your business and customers? If you don’t
require fancy office space to impress
others or to meet with clients, work at
home. If you operate a retail business that
requires lots of customers coming to you,
getting outside space is probably the best
(and legally correct) choice. Check with the
governing authorities of your town or city to
find out what local regulations exist for
home-based businesses.
 Discipline: At home, do you have the disci-
pline to work the number of hours that you
need and want, or will the kitchen goodies
tempt you to make half a dozen snack trips?
Can you refrain from turning on the televi-
sion every hour for late-breaking news? The
sometimes amorphous challenge of figuring
out how to grow the business may cause
you to focus your energies elsewhere.
 Family matters: Last, but not least, your
home life should factor into where you
decide to work. One advantage to working
at home when you’re a parent is that you
can be a more involved parent. If nothing
else, you can spend the one to two hours
per day that many people spend commuting
with your kids! Just make sure that you try
to set aside work hours, during which time
your office is off limits.
Ask other family members how they feel
about your working at home. Be specific
about what you plan to do, where, when, and
how. Will clients come over? What time of
day and where in the home will you meet
with them? You may not think that your home
office is an imposition, but your spouse may.
Home business problems come between
many couples. If you’re single and living
alone, home life is less of an issue.

 Compare your site’s costs to other sites to evaluate the deal that the
lessor offers you.
 Your lease contract needs to include a cap for the triple-net costs at a
specified limit per square foot.
 Try to make sure that the lease contract doesn’t make you responsible
for removal costs for any toxic waste you may discover during your
occupation. Also exclude increased property taxes that the sale of the
property may cause.
 If feasible, get your landlord to pay for remodeling — it’s cheaper for the
landlord to do it and entails fewer hassles for you.
 With retail leases, get an option for renewal — this is critical in retail,
where location is important. The option should specify the cost — for
example, something like 5 percent below market, as determined by 
arbitration.
 Get an option that the lease can be transferred to a new owner if you sell
the business.
If you really think that you want to purchase (not lease) because you can see
yourself staying in the same place for at least five years, read Chapter 11.
Equipping your business space
You can easily go overboard spending money when leasing or buying office
space and outfitting that space. The most common reason that small-business
owners spend more than they should is to attempt to project a professional,
upscale image. You can have an office or retail location that works for you and
your customers without spending a fortune if you observe some simple rules:
 Buy — don’t lease or finance — equipment. Unless you’re running a
manufacturing outfit where the cost of buying equipment is prohibitive,
try to avoid borrowing and leasing. If you can’t buy office furniture, 
computers, cash registers, and so on with cash, then you probably can’t
afford them! Buying such things on credit or leasing them — leasing is
invariably the most expensive way to go — encourages you to spend
beyond your means.
Consider buying used equipment, especially furniture, which takes
longer to become obsolete. The more popular a piece of equipment, the
more beneficial it is for you to purchase rather than lease: If many other
businesses would be willing to buy the equipment, you’ll have an easier
time unloading it if you ever want to sell it. Leasing may make more
sense with oddball-type equipment that is more of a hassle and costly
for you to unload after a short usage period.
312
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

 Don’t get carried away with technological and marketing gadgets. I
know it’s hard to imagine, but the business world worked just fine (and
in some respects better) before $500 cell phones, personal digital assis-
tants, and $2,500 computers. Many small-business owners I speak with
spend all sorts of money on such things because they feel the need to be
“competitive” and “current.” Don’t forget the virtues of picking up the
phone or meeting in person — these forms of communication are much
more personal ways of doing business.
Voice mail is one device that many small-business owners find worth
spending money on. Voice mail sounds more professional than an
answering machine and can handle simultaneous calls with ease. Best of
all, voice mail can save you money on administrative help.
Bootstrap-equipping your office makes sense within certain limits (see
“Bootstrapping,” earlier in this chapter). If customers come to you, of course,
you don’t want a shabby-looking store or office. However, that doesn’t mean
that you have to purchase the Rolls Royce equivalent of everything that you
need for your office.
Accounting for the Money
One of the less glamorous aspects of running your own business is dealing
with accounting. Unlike when you work for an employer, you must track your
business’s income, expenses, and taxes (for you and your employees).
Although you may be able to afford to hire others to help with these dreary
tasks, you must know the inner workings of your business in order to keep
control of your business, to stay out of trouble with the tax authorities, and
to minimize your taxes. The following sections show you how to handle the
accounting aspect of your business.
Tax record keeping and payments
With revenue hopefully flowing into your business and expenses surely head-
ing out, you must keep records to help satisfy your tax obligations and to
keep a handle on the financial status and success of your business. You can’t
accurately complete the necessary tax forms for your business if you don’t
properly track your income and expenses. And should the IRS audit you —
the probability of being audited as a small-business owner is about four times
higher than when you’re an employee at a company — you’ll need to prove
some or even all of your expenses and income.
313
Chapter 14: Starting and Running Your Own Small Business

In order to keep your sanity, and keep the IRS at bay, make sure that you do
the following:
 Pay your taxes each quarter and on time. When you’re self-employed,
you’re responsible for the accurate and timely filing of all taxes that you
owe on your income on a quarterly basis. You must pay taxes by the
15th of January, April, June, and September. (If the 15th falls on the
weekend, however, the payment is due the Monday that follows the
15th.) To pay correctly, call the IRS at 800-TAX-FORM and ask for Form
1040-ES (Estimated Tax for Individuals) or download this form from its
Web site at www.irs.gov. This form comes complete with an easy-to-use
estimated tax worksheet and four payment coupons that you send in
with your quarterly tax payments. Mark the due dates for your quarterly
taxes on your calendar so that you don’t forget!
If you have employees, you also need to withhold taxes from each pay-
check they receive. You must then use the money that you deduct from
their paychecks to make timely payments to the IRS and to the appropri-
ate state authorities. In addition to federal and state income tax, you
also need to withhold and send in Social Security and any other state or
locally mandated payroll taxes. Pay these taxes immediately after with-
holding them from your employees’ paychecks and never use the money
to fund your business needs.
I recommend using a payroll service to ensure that your payments are
made on time and correctly to all the different places that these tax fil-
ings need to go.
 Keep your business accounts separate from your personal accounts.
The IRS knows that small-business owners, as a group, cheat more on
their tax returns than do company employees. One way that dishonest
entrepreneurs cheat is hiding business income and inflating business
expenses. Thus, the IRS looks skeptically at business owners who use
and commingle funds in personal checking and credit card accounts for
business transactions.
Although you may find opening and maintaining separate business
accounts troublesome, do so. And remember to pay for only legitimate
business expenses through your business account. You’ll be thankful
come tax preparation time to have separate records. Having separate
records can also make the IRS easier to deal with if and when you’re
audited.
 Keep good records of your business income and expenses. You can use
file folders, software, or a shoebox to collect your business income and
expenses, but just do it! When you need to file your annual return, you
want to be able to find the documentation that allows you to figure your
business income and expenses. For most people, the file folder system
works best. If your business is small, one folder for income and one for
your expenses will do. Computer software can help you with this
314
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

drudgery as well. Because you must go through the hassle of entering
the data, software is more useful with larger small businesses and in
those businesses that process lots of checks or expenses.
Charging expenses on a credit card or writing a check can make the doc-
umentation for most businesses easier. These methods of payment leave
a paper trail that simplifies the task of tallying up your expenses come
tax time and makes the IRS auditor less grumpy in the event that he
audits you. (Just make sure that you don’t overspend, as many people
do with credit cards!)
In addition to keeping good records, you also need to decide on what basis,
cash or accrual, you want your company to keep its books. Most small-business
owners use the cash method, which simply means that for tax purposes, you
recognize or report income in the year it’s received and expenses in the year
they’re paid. (The accrual method, by contrast, records income when the sale
is made even if the customer hasn’t yet paid; expenses are recognized when
incurred even if your business hasn’t paid the bill yet.) Sole proprietorships,
partnerships, and S and personal service corporations generally can use the
cash method. C corporations and partnerships that have C corporations as
partners may not use the cash accounting method.
The advantage of operating on a cash basis is that you can control the
amount of your business income and expenses that your business reports for
tax purposes year to year. Doing so can lower your tax bill. Suppose that,
looking ahead to the next tax year, you have good reason to believe that your
business will make more money, pushing you into a higher tax bracket. You
can likely reduce your tax bill if you pay more of your expenses in the next
year. For example, instead of buying a new computer late this year, wait until
early next year. (Note: The IRS recognizes credit card expenses by the date
when you make the charges, not when you pay the bill.) Likewise, you can
somewhat control when your customers pay you. If you expect to make less
money next year, simply don’t invoice customers in December of this year.
Wait until January so that you receive the income from those sales next year.
How to (legally) pay lower taxes
Every small business must spend money, and spending money in your busi-
ness holds the allure of lowering your tax bill. But don’t spend money on
your business just for the sake of generating tax deductions. Spend your
money to make the most of the tax breaks that you can legally take. The fol-
lowing are some examples of legal tax breaks:
 Take it all off now or spread it around for later. As a small-business
owner, if you have net income, you can deduct up to $105,000 (for tax year
2005) per year for equipment purchases (for example, espresso machines,
computers, desks, and chairs) for use in your business. By deducting via a
315
Chapter 14: Starting and Running Your Own Small Business

Section 179 deduction, you can immediately deduct the entire amount
that you spend on equipment for your business. Normally, equipment for
your business is depreciated over a number of years. With depreciation,
you claim a tax deduction yearly for a portion of the total purchase price
of the equipment. For example, if you drop two grand on a new computer,
you can take a $400 deduction annually for this computer’s depreciation
(if you elect straight-line depreciation). If you elect the special 179 deduc-
tion, you can claim the entire $2,000 outlay at once (as long as you haven’t
exceeded the $105,000 annual cap).
Taking all the deduction in one year by using the Section 179 deduction
method is enticing, but you may pay more taxes in the long run that way.
Consider that in the early years of most businesses, profits are low. When
your business is in a low tax bracket, the value of your deductions is low.
If your business grows, you may come out ahead if you depreciate your
early-year big-ticket expenses, thereby postponing to higher-tax-bracket
years some of the deductions that you can take off.
 Make the most of your auto deductions. If you use your car for business,
you can claim a deduction, but don’t waste a lot of money on a car, think-
ing that the IRS helps pay for all of it — because it doesn’t. The IRS limits
how large an annual auto expense you can claim for depreciation. Another
advantage of purchasing a more reasonably priced car: You won’t be bur-
dened with documenting your actual auto expenses and calculating depre-
ciation. You can use the auto expense method of just claiming a flat 40.5
cents per mile (tax year 2005).
 Deduct travel, meal, and entertainment expenses. For the IRS to 
consider your expense deductible, your travel must be for a bona fide
business purpose. For example, if you live in Chicago, fly to Honolulu
for a week, and spend one day at a seminar for business purposes and
then the other six days snorkeling and sunning, you can deduct only the
expenses for the one day of your trip that you devoted to business. (An
exception to this rule that enables you to write off more of your trip
does exist: If you extend a business trip to stay over a Saturday night
to qualify for a lower airfare and you save money in total travel costs,
you can claim the extra costs that you incurred to stay over through
Sunday!)
Don’t waste your money on meal and entertainment expenses. You can
deduct only 50 percent of your business expenses; by all means, take
that 50 percent deduction when you can legally do so, but don’t spend
frivolously on business trips and think that you can deduct everything.
The IRS doesn’t allow business deductions for club dues (such as for
health, business, airport, or social clubs) or entertainment (such as
executive boxes at sports stadiums).

Keeping a Life and Perspective
David Packard, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, said, “You are likely to die not
of starvation for opportunities, but of indigestion of opportunities.”
Most small businesses succeed in keeping their owners more than busy —
in some cases, too busy. If you provide needed products or services at a fair
price, customers will beat a path to your door. Your business will grow and
be busier than what you can personally handle. You may need to start hiring
people. I know small-business owners who work themselves into a frenzy and
put in 70 or more hours a week.
If you enjoy your work so much so that it’s not really work and you end up
putting in long hours because you enjoy it, terrific! But success in your com-
pany can cause you to put less energy into other important aspects of your
life that perhaps don’t come as easily.
Although careers and business successes are important, don’t place these
successes higher than fourth on your overall priority list. You can’t replace
your health, family, and friends — but you can replace a job or a business.

W
hen you decide to purchase a home, you can choose between buying
an existing one (that someone has more than likely lived in) or build-
ing one from scratch. Purchasing an already-built home satisfies most people
because building a home requires a lot of work, takes a lot of time, and has a
lot of potential for screw-ups.
Each year, hundreds of thousands of small businesses change hands. This
chapter is for those of you who want to run or invest in an existing small
business but don’t want to start the business yourself. And of course, this
chapter can show you how to make good money and have fun along the way!
Looking at the Advantages 
of Buying a Business
I don’t want to scare you off if you want to start a business. However, as with
buying an existing home, buying someone else’s business works better for
some people than others. The following list reflects the main advantages of
buying a business:
 You avoid start-up hassles and headaches. Starting a business
from scratch requires dealing with a lot of stuff — just take a look at
Chapters 13 and 14 to get an idea of what you’d have to deal with. In
the early years, beyond formulating a business plan, you must also deal
with a variety of issues, such as developing a marketing plan, finding

customers, locating space, hiring employees, and incorporating. If you
buy a good existing business, you buy into an ongoing enterprise with
customers, assets, and hopefully profits (although you still need to fix
any problems the business may have).
Think about the learning curve for the type of business you’re considering
purchasing. Buying an existing business makes more sense if the business
is complicated. For example, purchasing a business that manufactures
musical instruments makes more sense than purchasing a plumbing 
business that requires plumbing know-how and a few tools to start up.
Unless you’ve built musical instruments before and understand the intri-
cacies of the production process, starting such a business from scratch
is quite risky and perhaps foolhardy. (However, purchasing an existing
plumbing business may still make sense if, for example, you don’t want
to build a stable of customers from scratch.)
 You don’t have to come up with an idea for a product or service.
Starting a business is hard if you lack an idea for a product or service
to sell. If nothing new strikes your fancy, you have a good reason to buy
an existing business.
 You reduce risk. Although investing in something with a solid track
record is still far from a sure thing, your risk may be significantly lower
than the risk involved in a start-up. After a business has an operating
history and offers a product or service with a demonstrated market,
some of the risk in the company is removed. Looking at historic financial
statements also helps you make more accurate financial forecasts than
you could make with a start-up venture.
 You enhance your ability to attract investor or lender money. You
should have less difficulty raising money from investors and lenders
for your existing business than with a start-up. Attracting most investors
to something that’s more than an idea is easier. And for the amount that
they invest, investors demand a smaller piece of an existing business
than they would with an investment in an idea.
 You want to enter a business where buying an existing business is
your only ticket in. You can enter some businesses — such as bottlers
or car dealerships — only through your purchase of a business that
already exists.
 You can find businesses where you can add value. Some entrepreneurs
who start businesses don’t see the potential for growth or don’t want
to grow their business — they may be burned out, content with their
current profit, or simply ready to retire. Finding businesses where the
potential exists to improve operating efficiency and to expand into new
markets isn’t too hard. Relative to investing in stocks or real estate, find-
ing small companies that are undervalued relative to the potential that
they can offer is easier for a business-minded person.
320
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

Just because you think that you see potential to improve a business, don’t
pay a high price based on your high expectations. You can be wrong —
you may be looking at the business through rose-colored glasses. Even if
you’re correct about the potential, don’t pay the current owner for the
hard work and ingenuity that you’ll bring to the business if you purchase
it. Offer a fair price based on the value of the business now — I explain
how to figure this value in the section “Evaluating a Small Business,” later
in this chapter.
Understanding the Disadvantages
of Buying a Business
Just as everyone doesn’t enjoy running or cooking, some people don’t enjoy
the negatives that come with buying an existing business. If the following
issues don’t turn you off, purchasing an existing business may be right for you:
 You buy the baggage. When you buy an existing business, the bad
comes with the good, and all businesses include their share of the bad.
The business may employ problem employees, for example, or it may
have a less-than-stellar reputation in the marketplace. Even if the
employees are good, they and the culture of the company may not mesh
with where you want to take the company in the future.
Do you have the ability to motivate people to change — or to fire them if
they don’t? Do you have the patience to work at improving the com-
pany’s products and reputation? You need these types of skills and traits
in order to run and add value to a company. Some people enjoy and
thrive on such challenges, and others find such pressures very hard to
deal with. Think back on your other work experiences for information
about what challenges you’ve tackled and how you felt about them.
 You need to do a lot of inspection. If you think that buying a company is
easier than starting one, think again. You must know what you’re buying
before you buy. So you need to do a thorough inspection, perform due
diligence, kick the tires, or whatever you want to call it. For example, you
need to rip apart financial statements to ascertain whether the company
is really as profitable as it appears and to determine its financial health.
After you close the deal and the checks and/or money are transferred,
you can’t change your mind. Unless a seller commits fraud or lies (which
is difficult and costly for a buyer to legally prove), it’s “buyer beware”
about the quality of the business you’re buying. In “Evaluating a Small
Business,” later in this chapter, I cover the homework that you need to
do before you buy.
321
Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business

 You need more capital. Existing businesses have value, which is why
you generally need more money to buy a business than to start one. If
you’re short of cash, starting a company is generally a lower-cost path.
 Lower risk means lower returns. If you purchase a good business and
run it well, you can make decent money. In some cases, you can make a
lot of money. But you generally have less upside and potential for hitting
it really big than with a business you start. Those who have built the
greatest wealth from small businesses are generally those who have
started them rather than those who bought existing ones.
 You don’t get the satisfaction of creating a business. Whether for your
ego or your psyche, entrepreneurs who build their own businesses get a
different experience than those who buy someone else’s enterprise. You
can make your mark on a business that you buy, but doing so takes a
number of years. Even then, the business is never completely your own
creation.
Prerequisites to Buying a Business
Not everyone is cut out to succeed when buying an existing business. Even if
you have sufficient funds for the purchase, you may be blind to a whole host
of problems and pitfalls and can end up losing your entire investment. Later in
this chapter, I introduce you to some small-business buyers who did just that.
Conversely, some people with little money for buying a business succeed
wildly. You can purchase a good small business with little and, in rare cases,
no money down. So what, then, are the traits common to people who suc-
cessfully buy and operate an existing small business?
Business experience
First, you should have business experience and background. If you were an
economics or business major in college and you took accounting and other
quantitatively oriented courses, you’re off to a good start.
Even better than academic learning is work experience in the type of business
that you want to buy. If you want to run a restaurant, go work in one. Consider
the experience as paid on-the-job training for running your own restaurant.
If you’ve worked as a consultant on business-management issues with a vari-
ety of industries, you also have a good background. However, the danger in
having done only consulting is that you’re usually not on the front lines,
where most of the serious business operational issues arise.
322
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

Should none of the previous examples apply to you, I won’t say that you’re
doomed to fail if you buy a business, but I will say that the odds are
against you.
If you don’t have business experience, you’ll likely do far better in your first
business venture after some remedial work. Get some hands-on experience,
which is more valuable than any degree or credential that you can earn
through course work. There’s no substitute for the real-life experiences of
marketing to and interacting with customers, grappling with financial state-
ments, dealing with competitive threats, and doing the business of business.
However, I don’t endorse not doing any academic course work. You may, in
fact, be required to get a credential to be able to do the work that you want
to do. If you don’t need a specific credential, taking selected courses and
reading good business books (I recommend some in Chapter 18) can boost
your knowledge.
Financial background
To purchase a business, as with real estate, you need to make a down pay-
ment on the purchase price. In most cases, you need to put down 25 to 30
percent. Bankers and business sellers who make loans to business buyers
normally require such down payments in order to protect their loan. Small-
business buyers who make such down payments are less likely to walk away
from a loan obligation if the business gets into financial trouble.
If you lack sufficient capital for a down payment, try asking family or friends
to invest. You can also set your sights on a less expensive business or seek
business owners willing to accept a smaller down payment. If you can find a
business for sale where the owner wants less than 20 percent down, you may
be on to something good. Be careful, though, because an owner who accepts
such a small down payment may have a difficult time selling because of prob-
lems inherent in the business or because the business is overpriced.
You can purchase some existing small businesses with a loan from the selling
owner. Also, check for loans with banks in your area that specialize in small-
business loans. (See Chapter 14 for other financing ideas.)
Finding a Good Business to Buy:
Conducting a Focused Search
Unless you’re extraordinarily lucky, finding a good business to buy takes a
great deal of time. If you spend time outside of your work hours, finding a
323
Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business

quality business right for you to buy can easily take a year or two. Even if you
can afford to look full time, finding and closing on a business can still take
you many months.
Above all else, it pays to be persistent, patient, and willing to spend time
on things that don’t lead immediately to results. You must be willing to sort
through some rubbish. If you require immediate gratification in terms of com-
pleting a deal, you can make yourself miserable in your search or rush into a
bad deal.
You’re going to end up spinning your wheels (and likely end up with the
wrong type of business for yourself) unless you set some boundaries for your
business search. You don’t need to be rigid or to precisely define every detail
of the business that you want to purchase, but you do need to set some para-
meters so you can start laying the groundwork to purchase.
Each person has unique shopping criteria. The following list exemplifies
some good ones to help narrow your search:
 Size/purchase price: The money you have available to invest in a busi-
ness determines the size of business that you can afford. As a rough
rule, figure that you can afford to pay a purchase price of about three
times the amount of cash you have earmarked for the business. For
example, if you have $50,000 in the till, you should look at buying a busi-
ness for about $150,000. Because many business sellers overprice their
businesses, you can probably look at businesses listed at a price above
$150,000, perhaps as high as $200,000.
 Location: If you’re already rooted and don’t want to move or deal with a
long commute, the business’s location further narrows the field. Although
you may be willing to look at a broader territory, maybe even nationally
if you’re willing to relocate, evaluating businesses long-distance is diffi-
cult and costly. Unless you want a highly specialized type of company,
try to keep your business search local.
 Industry: Industry-specific expertise that you want to use in the business
you buy can help whittle the pool of businesses down further. If you don’t
have industry-specific expertise, I highly recommend that you focus on
some specific niches in industries that interest you or that you know
something about. Focusing on an industry helps you conduct a more
thorough search and turns up higher-quality companies. The industry
knowledge that you accumulate in your search process can pay big divi-
dends during your years of ownership in the business.
If you have a hard time brainstorming about specific industries, use this
trick to jump-start your creativity — take a walk through the Yellow
Pages! All the business types known to exist in your area are listed
alphabetically. Remember that a separate Yellow Pages directory exists
for businesses that sell mainly to consumers; a business-to-business
Yellow Pages directory lists businesses whose customers are primarily
324
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

other businesses. Look at either or both, depending on the types of busi-
nesses that interest you. You also may want to buy a business in a sector
that is experiencing fast growth so that you, too, can ride the wave.
Check out Inc. magazine’s annual Inc. 500 list of the fastest-growing
smaller companies in America.
 Opportunity to add value: Some buyers want to purchase a business
with untapped opportunities or problems that need fixing. As with real
estate, however, many people are happier leaving the fixer-uppers to the
contractors. Some businesses without major problems can offer signifi-
cant untapped potential.
After you define your shopping criteria, you’re ready to go to the marketplace
of businesses for sale. I recommend that you type up your criteria on a single
page so that you can hand it to others who may put you in touch with busi-
nesses for sale. The following sections give you the best techniques for iden-
tifying solid businesses that meet your needs.
Perusing publications
If you’re focused on specific industry sectors, you may be surprised to find
out that all sorts of specialty newsletters and magazines are published. Just
think of the fun you can have reading publications such as the Alternative
Energy Retailer, Specialty Foods Merchandising, Coal Mining Newsletter,
Advanced Battery Technology, or Gas Turbine World! Specialty publications get
you into the thick of an industry and also contain ads for businesses for sale
or business brokers who work in the industry.
A useful reference publication that you can find in public libraries with decent
business sections is a two-volume set entitled Small Business Sourcebook
(Gale). Organized alphabetically by industry, this reference contains listings
of publications, trade associations, and other information sources.
Conducting literature searches of general interest business publications can
help you identify articles on your industry of interest. The Reader’s Guide to
Periodicals and online computer searches can help you find the articles. Web
sites worth examining include www.bizbuysell.com and www.sba.gov.
Networking with advisors
Speak with accountants, attorneys, bankers, and business consultants who
specialize in working with small businesses. These advisors are sometimes
the first to hear of a small-business owner’s desire to sell. Advisors may also
suggest good businesses that aren’t for sale but whose owners may consider
selling (see the next section).
325
Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business

Knocking on some doors
If you own a home and someone came to your door and said he was inter-
ested in buying your home, you’d likely say that you’re not interested in sell-
ing. If the interested buyer said that he really liked the type of property that
you had and that he was willing to pay you a good price, the person may get
a little more of your attention, but you’d still likely turn him away. However,
if you were already considering selling your home, you might be all ears,
especially if you could sell your house directly and save paying a broker’s
commission.
Why would you want to go to this trouble and bother business owners? Well,
some business owners who haven’t listed their business for sale may be
thinking about selling, so if you approach enough businesses that interest
you, you may find some of these not-yet-on-the-market businesses with
owners interested in selling. You can increase the possibility of finding your
desired business, and you may get a good deal on such a business because
you can negotiate with such a seller from the beneficial position of not having
to compete with other potential buyers.
Instead of calling on the phone or literally knocking on the business’s door,
start your communications by mail. Sending a concise letter of introduction
explaining what kind of business that you’re looking for and what a wonderful
person you are demonstrates that you’re investing some time in this endeavor.
Follow up with a call a week or so after you send the letter.
Working with business brokers
Numerous small businesses for sale list their enterprises through business
brokers. Just as a real estate agent makes a living selling real estate, a busi-
ness broker makes a living selling businesses.
Business brokers generally sell smaller small businesses — those with less
than $1 million in annual sales. These businesses tend to be family-owned or
sole proprietorships, such as restaurants, dry cleaners, other retailers, and
service firms. About half of such small businesses are sold through brokers.
Most business brokerage firms sell different types of businesses. Some firms,
however, specialize in one industry or a few industries.
One advantage of working with brokers to buy a business is that a broker can
expose you to other businesses you may not have considered (a doughnut
shop, for example, instead of a restaurant). Brokers can also share their
knowledge with you — like the fact that you need to get up at 4 a.m. to make
doughnuts. Still want to buy a doughnut shop?
326
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

The pitfalls of working with brokers are numerous:
 Commission: Brokers aren’t your business advisors; they’re salespeople.
That fact doesn’t make them corrupt or dishonest, but it does mean that
their interests aren’t aligned with yours. Their goal is to do a deal and
do the deal soon. And the more you pay for your business, the more
they make. Business brokers typically get paid 10 to 12 percent of the
sales price of the business. Technically, the seller pays this fee, but as
with real estate deals done through brokers, the buyer actually pays.
Remember, if a broker isn’t involved, the seller can sell for a lower price
and still clear more money, and the buyer is better off, too.
 Undesirable businesses: Problem businesses are everywhere, but a fair
number end up with brokers when the owners encounter trouble selling
on their own.
 Packaging: This problem relates to the preceding two. Brokers help not-
so-hot businesses look better than they really are. Doing so may involve
lying, but more typically, it involves stretching the truth, omitting nega-
tives, and hyping potential. (Owners who sell their business themselves
may do these things as well.)
You (and your advisors) need to perform the due diligence on a business
that you may buy (see Chapter 14). Never, ever trust or use the selling
package that a broker prepares for a business as your sole source of
information. Remember: Brokers, as well as sellers, can stretch the truth,
lie, and commit fraud.
 Access to limited inventory: Unlike real estate brokers (who can access
all homes listed with brokers for sale in an area through a shared listing
service), a business broker can generally tell you only about his office’s
listings. (Confidentiality is an issue because a shared listing service
increases the number of people who can find out that a business is for
sale and the particulars of the sale. This may cause some customers to
find another company to do business with and may lead some key
employees to leave as well.)
If you want to work with a business broker, use more than one. Working
with a larger business brokerage firm or one that specializes in listing
the type of business that you’re looking for can maximize the number
of possible prospects that you see. Some state associations of business
brokers share their listings. However, even in such states, some of the
larger brokerages opt to not include themselves because they benefit
less from sharing their information.
 Few licensing requirements: The business brokerage field isn’t tightly
regulated. The majority of states have no requirements — anyone can
hang out a shingle and work as a business broker. Some states allow
those with securities brokerage licenses to operate as business brokers,
whereas most states require real estate licenses.
327
Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business

You can find business brokers in the Yellow Pages under “Business Brokers.”
Ads for businesses for sale may lead you to a broker as well. You can also ask
tax, legal, and business consultants for names of good brokers they may
know. If you find a broker you think you’d like to work with, check references
from other buyers who have worked with the broker. Be sure that the broker
works full time and has solid experience. Some business brokers dabble in it
part time and make a living in other ways.
Ask the broker you’re interested in for the names of several buyers of similar
businesses whom they’ve worked with over the past six months. By narrow-
ing down the field to only your particular business interest, the broker can’t
just refer you to the three best deals of his career. Also, check whether
anyone has filed complaints against the brokerage with the local Better
Business Bureau (although the BBB favors member companies more and is
less likely to entertain and retain complaints against members) and state reg-
ulatory departments (real estate, attorney general, department of corpora-
tions, and so on) that oversee business brokers.
Considering a Franchise or Multilevel
Marketing Company
Among the types of businesses that you may buy are franchises and multi-
level marketing companies. Both of these types of businesses offer more of a
prepackaged and defined system for running a business. Although both types
may be worth your exploration, significant pitfalls can trip you up, especially
with multilevel marketing companies.
Finding a franchise
Purchasing a good franchise can be your ticket into the world of small-business
ownership. Some companies expand their locations through selling replicas,
or franchises, of their business. When you purchase a franchise, you buy the
local rights to a specified geographic territory to sell the company’s products
or services under the company’s name and to use the company’s system of
operation. In addition to an upfront franchisee fee, franchisers also typically
charge an ongoing royalty.
Franchising makes up a huge part of the business world. Companies that
franchise — such as McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, H&R Block, Midas Muffler, 7-11
stores, Gymboree, Century 21 Real Estate, Holiday Inn, Avis, Subway, and
Foot Locker — account for more than $1 trillion in sales annually.
328
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

Franchise advantages
When you purchase a new franchise, you don’t already have customers —
just like starting a business, you must find them, although the parent com-
pany should have a track record and multiple locations with customers. (You
can also purchase existing franchises from owners who want to sell.)
So why would you want to pay a good chunk of money to buy a business
without customers?
 Proven business: A company that has been in business for a number of
years and has successful franchisees proves the demand for the com-
pany’s products and services and shows that the company’s system for
providing those products and services works. The company has worked
the bugs out and hopefully solved common problems. As a franchise
owner, you benefit from and share in the experience that the parent
company has gained over the years.
 Name-brand recognition: Some consumers recognize the company
name of a larger and successful franchise company and may be more
inclined to purchase its products and services. Some consumers feel
more comfortable getting a muffler job done at franchiser Midas Muffler
rather than hunting around and calling Discount Muffler World or
Manny’s Muffler Bazaar from a Yellow Pages listing. The comfort that
comes from dealing with Midas may stem from the influence of adver-
tisements, recommendations of friends, or your own familiarity with
Midas’s services, perhaps in another part of the country. Most free-
standing small businesses for sale in a community lack name-brand
recognition.
 Centralized purchasing power: You would hope and expect that Midas,
as a corporation made up of hundreds of locations, buys mufflers at a
low price — volume purchasing generally leads to bigger discounts. In
addition to possibly saving franchisees money on supplies, the parent
company can also take the hassle out of figuring out where and how to
purchase supplies. Again, most unattached small businesses that you
could buy won’t offer this advantage, although quality business associa-
tions can provide some of these benefits.
Franchise pitfalls
As with purchasing other small businesses, pitfalls abound in buying a fran-
chise. Franchises aren’t for everyone. Here are some common problems that
may cause you to reconsider buying a franchise:
 You’re not the franchise type. When you buy a franchise, you buy into
an established system. People who like structure and following estab-
lished rules and systems adapt more easily to the franchise life. But if
you’re the creative sort who likes to experiment and change things, you
329
Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business

may be an unhappy franchisee. Unlike starting your own business,
where you can get into the game without investing lots of your time and
money, buying a franchise that you end up not enjoying can make for an
expensive learning experience.
 You may be locked into buying overpriced supplies. Centralized, bulk
purchasing through the corporate headquarters supposedly saves fran-
chisees time and money on supplies and other expenditures. Some fran-
chisers, however, take advantage of franchisees through large markups
on proprietary items that franchisees must buy from the franchisers.
 The franchise is unproven. If the company’s concept hasn’t stood the
test of time, don’t make yourself a guinea pig. Some franchisers show
more interest in simply selling franchises to collect the upfront franchise
money. Reputable franchisers want to help their franchisees succeed so
that they can collect an ongoing royalty from the franchisees’ sales.
 The franchise is a pyramid scheme. Unscrupulous, short-term-focused
business owners sometimes attempt to franchise their businesses and
sell as many franchises as they can as quickly as possible. Some push
their franchisees to sell franchises. The business soon focuses on selling
franchises rather than operating a business that sells a product or serv-
ice well. In rare cases, franchisers engage in fraud and sell next to noth-
ing, except the hopes of getting rich quick.
Evaluating a franchise
Make sure that you do plenty of homework before you agree to buy a fran-
chise. The following list is my catalog of critical steps that you need to take
before buying a franchise that interests you:
1. Request and read the Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (UFOC).
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires all franchisers to issue
this document at least ten days before a prospective franchise buyer
writes a check or signs a document to purchase. If you think you’re
interested in a particular franchise, ask for this important document and
read it cover to cover.
The UFOC contains a treasure trove of valuable information, such as the
names and addresses of the franchisees closest to your area, as well as a
list of franchises that the company terminated, didn’t renew, or bought
back. The document discloses pending or settled litigation and should
indicate potential or actual troubles between franchisers and fran-
chisees. The UFOC also gives you the employment background of the
franchiser’s senior management and your costs to purchase a franchise,
as well as required inventory, leases, and other costs.
330
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

2. Determine whether the franchisers are looking for a partner or your
wallet.
In your first interactions with the franchising company, observe the
demeanor and approach of those you speak with. Although all such
companies have enthusiastic salespeople, the best franchising compa-
nies want to check you out almost as much as you want to check them
out. Smart franchisers don’t want to sell a franchise to someone who is
likely to crash and burn or tarnish the company’s good reputation.
Smart companies know that their interests are aligned with yours —
they make more money from ongoing royalties if they sell franchises to
capable franchisees who succeed.
Run as fast as you can in the opposite direction if the franchisers tell
tales of great riches from just a small investment of your time and
money. Some franchisers are more interested in selling franchises
than in finding and helping the most-qualified franchisees succeed.
Such franchisers may also attempt to pressure you into making a quick
decision to buy, and they may be evasive about providing detailed infor-
mation about their business. If they don’t want to give you the UFOC,
run extra fast.
3. Speak with franchisees.
Talk with franchisees currently with the company, as well as those who
quit or were terminated. Start with the lists of franchisees that the UFOC
provides — not with references that the company provides. Ask the fran-
chisees about their experiences, both good and bad, with the parent
company. Those franchisees for whom things didn’t work out generally
tell you more about the warts of the system, but also try to identify
whether some of these people were poor fits. Conversely, active fran-
chisees may likely see their franchise experience through rose-colored
glasses, if for no other reason than to reinforce their decision to buy a
franchise. Observe the happiest and most successful franchisees and
see whether you share their business perspectives and traits.
4. Understand what you’re buying.
Good franchises can cost you a reasonable chunk of change upfront. On
the low end, service businesses, which you can run from your home, sell
for around a $25,000 upfront franchise fee; compare that to the several
hundred thousand to a million dollars required for the brick-and-mortar
locations of established franchisers, such as McDonald’s. Additionally,
ongoing franchise royalties run about 3 to 10 percent of gross revenue.
The UFOC details all the upfront costs. What do you get for this upfront
payment? Are the system and name brand worth this fee? What kind of
training will you receive?
331
Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business

5. Look at comparable franchises.
Few franchises are unique. Compare the cost of what a particular fran-
chise offers you to the cost of purchasing franchises from different compa-
nies in the same business. For example, if you’re considering purchasing a
tax-preparation franchise from a newer company, compare the terms and
offerings to H&R Block and Jackson Hewitt, two large, established, and
successful tax preparation franchise firms.
6. Consider the start-up alternative.
If you look at the “best” franchises in a particular business and think,
“Hey, I can do this as well or better and at less cost on my own,” then
consider starting your business from scratch. Make sure that you’re real-
istic, though, because starting a business involves many hidden costs —
both out-of-pocket financial costs and time costs.
7. Check with regulators.
Generally, both the federal and state levels of government regulate fran-
chises. The FTC regulates nationally, and the state level regulatory
agency is usually called something like the Department of Corporations
or the Attorney General’s Office. Check with these regulators to see
whether any complaints are on file. (As I mention at the start of this list,
the UFOC should also detail pending litigation against the company by
disgruntled franchisees.) Also, check with the Better Business Bureau in
the city where the franchising company is headquartered to discover
whether any information is on file.
8. Run a credit report on the company.
You can examine the franchiser’s credit report to get another indicator
of the kinds of business relationships that the franchiser maintains. Just
as you have a personal credit report on file, business credit reports
show how a company deals with payments and debts that it owes to
suppliers and creditors.
9. Review the franchise contract.
If your digging makes you feel more, rather than less, comfortable with
the franchise purchase, you now need to get down to the nitty-gritty of
the contract. Franchise contracts are usually long and tedious. Read the
contract completely to get a sense of what you’re getting yourself into.
Have an attorney who’s experienced with franchising agreements review
the contract as well. In addition to the financial terms, the contract
should specify how the company handles disputes, what rights you have
to sell the franchise in the future, and under what conditions the parent
company may terminate the franchise. Make sure that you can live with
and be happy with the nonfinancial parts of the contract.
332
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

10. Negotiate.
Different companies negotiate differently. Some companies offer their
best deal upfront and don’t engage in haggling. Others don’t put their
best foot forward in the hopes that you may simply sign and accept the
inferior terms and conditions. Some naive franchise buyers see the con-
tract as cast in stone and don’t negotiate. Remember that almost every-
thing is negotiable.
Cover all ten steps when you evaluate any franchise. You may be tempted to
cut corners in reviewing a franchise from a long-established company. Don’t.
You may not be right for the specific franchise, or perhaps the “successful”
company has mostly been good at keeping problems under wraps.
In “Evaluating a Small Business,” later in this chapter, I explain the homework
you should complete prior to buying an existing business. Read that section
as well, especially if you want to purchase an existing franchise from another
franchisee.
Considering a multilevel 
marketing company
A twist, and in most cases a bad one, on the franchising idea is multilevel mar-
keting (MLM) companies. Sometimes known as network companies, MLMs
can be thought of as a poor person’s franchise. I know dozens of people, from
clients I’ve worked with to students I’ve taught in my courses, who have been
sorely disappointed with the money and time they’ve spent on MLMs.
Some people are enthusiastic about MLMs. One book on the subject says:
Like an elemental force of nature, network marketing has risen from the
soil and roots of America’s heartland, boldly promising wealth, freedom,
and limitless horizons to those with the courage to seek them out.
One day I received a letter from a client of mine describing an MLM opportu-
nity. “It is the best thing I’ve ever seen,” gushed the letter. “I have friends who
are making $10,000, $25,000, $70,000, and $125,000 per month! $195 starter fee
gets you literally a national distributorship.”
The company, which I’ll call “Superhype Telemarketing,” sells long-distance
phone service and claims to offer rates far lower than the large telephone
companies. You pay for your starter kit, go through a short training seminar,
and — voilà — you’re in business for yourself. Work when you want, get a
share of every dollar that your customers spend on long distance, recruit
others as representatives, and make money off the business that they bring in.
333
Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business

For those weary of traditional jobs, the appeal of multilevel marketing is obvi-
ous. You can work at home, part time if you want. You have no employees.
You don’t need any experience. Yet you’re told you can still make big bucks.
If your parents raised you right, however, you should be skeptical of deals
like these. If you can make $10,000, $25,000, $70,000, and $125,000 per month,
wouldn’t everyone be doing it?
Superhype Telemarketing is one of many companies that use multilevel 
marketing. Representatives who work as independent contractors solicit 
customers as well as recruit new representatives, known in the industry as
your “downline.”
A big problem to watch out for is the business equivalent of the pyramid
scheme — businesses that exist to sign up other people. A little bit of digging
on my part revealed the following about Superhype Telemarketing: Its mar-
keting director advocates that you “Sell directly to those that you have direct
influence over. The system works great because you don’t need to resell
month after month. It’s an opportunity for anybody — it’s up to them how
much work they want to put into it.”
334
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
Work-from-home “opportunities”
“We made $18,269.56 in just 21⁄2 weeks!
Remarkable, home-based business! We do over
90 percent of the work for you! Free info:
800-555-8975.”
“Earn $4,000 per month on the new instant infor-
mation superhighway.”
“You can be earning $4,000 to $10,000 each
month in less than 30 days! We’ll even help you
hire agents to do the work for you . . . FREE!”
“Work from home. Company needs help. Earn
$500–$900 per week. Anyone can do this — will
train. Full time or part time. Call 555-8974. Only
for the serious — please!”
You can find lots of ad copy like this, especially
in magazines that small-business owners and
wannabe small-business owners read. In most
cases, these ads come from grossly overhyped
multilevel marketing companies. In other ads,
no legitimate company exists; instead, a person
(or two or three) simply tries to sell you some
“information” that explains the business oppor-
tunity. This information may cost several hun-
dred dollars or more. Such packages end up
being worthless marketing propaganda and
rarely provide useful information that you could-
n’t find at a far lower cost or no cost at all.
Never buy into anything like these ads that com-
panies (or people) pitch to you through the mail
or over the phone.

Any MLM examination should start with the company’s product or service. In
Superhype Telemarketing’s case, hundreds of companies offer telephone serv-
ice, so the service is hardly unique. Superhype Telemarketing claims to pro-
vide cheaper services than the large long-distance providers, as well as local
toll-call providers. Some of the company’s marketing materials claim savings
of as much as 50 percent to 75 percent. The reality: Comparing Superhype Tele-
marketing’s rates to the big, nationally advertised, name-brand, long-distance
phone services, which certainly aren’t the cheapest services, shows little dif-
ference in prices. If you make more than $10 in long-distance calls per month,
Superhype Telemarketing is about 7 percent cheaper. If you place more than
$50 per month in calls, Superhype’s rates are about the same.
A call to the Better Business Bureau in the city where Superhype Telemarketing
is headquartered revealed that the company has been the subject of dozens
of filed complaints of unauthorized switching of consumers’ long-distance
phone service by Superhype sales representatives. Other complaints alleged
misrepresentation of savings.
So what about the big money — can you make tens of thousands to a hun-
dred thousand dollars per month or more working for Superhype? For
starters, you must pay to become a Superhype representative. The fee of
$195 gets you a kit that provides advice, 12 months of a corporate newsletter,
and a small amount of training. If you want to get paid a $40 fee for training
others who sign up with the company, you must pay $395 to become a
trainer.
Superhype Telemarketing put me in touch with one of its most successful
salespeople: Big Al. “I used to be in real estate and got tired of the headaches
of dealing with tenants . . . the idea of earning residual payments for everyone
signed up to use a phone service appealed to me,” Big Al said. Without my
asking, he told me that he made $17,000 working part time in his first year
and then, working full time, he earned $60,000, $670,000, and $1.4 million in
his next three years, respectively.
Being a skeptic, I asked Big Al for proof. He said he’d be happy to fax me a
copy of a big check that he was presented with two years prior. What he sent
were marketing materials that showed photos of “top leaders” being pre-
sented with oversized checks, similar to the props that companies use for
public relations opportunities when they make a big contribution to charity.
Big Al’s check (which was supposedly for one month) was for $57,000.
Not satisfied with this copy as proof, I asked Big Al for his monthly sales
report from Superhype, which I know the company provides to all its repre-
sentatives. He said he didn’t have this information because his tax preparer
was working on his return. When I pointed out that the month in question
335
Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business

was from two years ago and not in the past year, he said that all his financial
statements were in storage and that because he was soon heading out of
town for ten days, he wouldn’t have a chance to retrieve them until he got
back. I then suggested that his tax preparer send me his proof of income for a
recent year or some other sort of proof. I’m still waiting.
As for the company’s other top producers, the company never provided proof
of the hyped income claims. All this hype reminds me of the movie Quiz Show
(I recommend that you see it if you haven’t yet), an eye-opening account of
how television quiz shows in the 1950s were rigged to dupe the public.
Big Al, who is also one of the company’s most successful recruiters, claims
that the company is contractually obligated to pay residuals and can’t cut
sales reps out of the picture financially after they sign up others. However,
according to Superhype’s marketing director, “There is no guarantee of future
payments. The company has the ability to change its program at any time.”
So if Superhype’s management or a future buyer of the company decides to
cut commissions, reps will be at their mercy.
Also cause for pause: Superhype’s marketing packages contain a feature 
article (which is from a supposed business periodical) that praises the com-
pany. Buried in the fine print on the back page of the reprint of the “article,”
which is sandwiched around a two-page ad for the company, is the following:
“Information contained in feature articles is provided by the company.”
Turns out that when a company like Superhype buys the space for the ad,
the “story” comes with it as well! The sticker price for the ad exceeds
$10,000. Rather than an independent appraisal of the company, this article
is basically an ad that Superhype bought.
The bottom line on any network marketing “opportunity” is to remember that
it’s a job. No company is going to pay you a lot of money for little work. As
with any other small-business venture, if you hope to earn a decent income,
multilevel marketing opportunities require at least three to five years of low
income to build up your business. Most people who buy into networks such
as Superhype make little money, and many quit and move on. According to a
Superhype company document, more than 60 percent of its representatives
make less than $100 per month and fewer than 5 percent make more than
$1,000 monthly, but you’d never know this information from its advertising
or sales hype.
Also, think twice before you sign up relatives, friends, and co-workers —
often the first people whom network marketers encourage you to sell to. A
danger in doing business with those people whom you have influence over is
that you put your reputation and integrity on the line. You could be putting
your friendships and family relations on the line as well.
336
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

Do your homework and remember that due diligence requires digging for
facts and talking to people who don’t have a bias or reason to sell to you. Do
the same homework that I recommended for franchises in the “Evaluating a
franchise” section, earlier in this chapter. Be skeptical of multilevel marketing
systems, unless the company has a long track record and many people who
are happy. Assume that an MLM company isn’t worth pursuing until your
extensive due diligence proves otherwise.
Evaluating a Small Business
If you put in many hours, you may eventually come across a business that
interests and intrigues you so much that you consider purchasing it. As with
337
Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business
Quality multilevel marketing companies
are the exception
A number of network companies have achieved
success over the years. Amway, Herbalife, and
Mary Kay have stood the test of time and
achieved significant size. Amway founders
Richard De Vos and Jay Van Andel achieved
multibillionaire status.
Not all multilevel companies are created equal,
and few are worth a look. However, Mary Kay,
which sells primarily makeup and skin care
products, is an example of a successful network
company with a 30-plus year history. Mary Kay
has hundreds of thousands of sales represen-
tatives and does business worldwide. Although
not shy about the decent money that its more
successful salespeople make, Mary Kay doesn’t
hype the income potential. Local sales directors
typically earn $50,000 to $100,000 per year, but
this income comes after many years of hard
work. Mary Kay rewards top sellers with gifts,
such as the famous pink Cadillac.
The ingredients for Mary Kay’s success include
competitive pricing, personal attention, and
social interaction, which many stores don’t or
can’t offer their customers. “We make shopping
and life fun . . . we make people look and feel
good,” says Mary Gentry, one of Mary Kay’s
sales directors.
Mary Kay encourages prospective Mary Kay
reps to try the products first and then host a
group before they sign up and fork over the $100
to purchase a showcase of items to sell. To
maximize sales, the company encourages Mary
Kay representatives to keep a ready inventory
because customers tend to buy more when
products are immediately available. If reps want
out of the business, they can sell their inventory
back to the company at 90 cents on the dollar
originally paid, a good sign that the company
stands behind its product.
Quality multilevel marketing companies make
sense for people who really believe in and want
to sell a particular product or service and don’t
want to or can’t tie up a lot of money buying a
franchise or other business. Just remember to
check out the MLM company, and realize that
you won’t get rich in a hurry, or probably ever.

purchasing a piece of real estate, major hurdles stand between you and own-
ership of the business. You need to inspect what you want to buy, negotiate
a deal, and finalize a contract — done correctly, these processes take a lot
of time.
Doing due diligence
The American legal system presumes a person is innocent until a jury proves
that person is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. When you purchase a busi-
ness, however, you must assume that the selling business owner is guilty of
making the business appear better than what it is (and possibly lying) until
you prove otherwise.
I don’t want to sound cynical, but a business owner can use more than a few
tricks to make a business look more profitable, financially healthier, and more
desirable than it really is. You can’t decide how much inspection or due dili-
gence to conduct on a business based on your gut-level feeling.
Because you can’t guess what hidden surprises exist in a business, you must
dig for them. Until you prove to yourself beyond a reasonable doubt that
these surprises don’t exist, don’t go through with a business purchase.
When you find a business that you think you want to purchase, you
absolutely, positively must do your homework before you buy. However, just
as with purchasing a home, you don’t want to expend buckets of money and
time on detailed inspections until you can reach an agreement with the seller.
What if you deal with a seller who is unrealistic about what the business is
worth? You need to perform the most serious, time-consuming, and costly
due diligence after you have an accepted offer to purchase a business. Make
such inspections a contingency in your purchase contract (see “Using contin-
gencies,” later in this chapter).
Ultimately, if you’re going to buy a business, you need to follow a plan similar
to, but likely shorter than, the business plan I present in Chapter 13.
Addressing such issues in a plan goes a long way toward helping you perform
your due diligence.
Following are some additional questions that you need to answer about a
business you’re contemplating purchasing. (Address as many of the ques-
tions as possible before you make your offer.)
 Why is the owner selling? Ask the owner or the owner’s advisors why
the owner wants to sell and why now. The answer may shed insight on
the owner’s motivations and need to sell. Some owners want to bail
when they see things getting worse.
338
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

 What is the value of the assets that you want to buy? This value
includes not only equipment but also “soft” assets, such as the firm’s
name and reputation with customers and suppliers, customer lists,
patents, and so on. Interview key employees, customers, suppliers, advi-
sors, and competitors. Ask key customers and key employees whether
they would still be loyal to the business if you took it over.
 What do the financial statements reveal? Search for the same things
that you would look for in a company whose stock you’re considering
purchasing. (See Chapter 6 for how to read financial statements and
what to look for.) Don’t take the financial statements at face value simply
because they’re audited. The accountant who did the audit may be
incompetent or chummy with the seller.
One way to check for shenanigans is to ask the seller for a copy of
the business’s tax returns. Owners are more likely to try to minimize
reported revenue and maximize expenses on their tax return to keep
from paying more tax. After you have an accepted purchase offer, ask
a tax advisor experienced in such matters to do an audit (see the
“Questioning profits” sidebar in this chapter for more information).
 If the company leases its space, what does the lease contract say? A
soon-to-expire lease at a low rate can ruin a business’s profit margins.
With a retail location, the ability to maintain a good location is also vital.
Check comparables — that is, what other similar locations lease for —
to see whether the current lease rate is fair, and talk to the building
owner to discover his plans for the building. Ask for and review (with
the help of a legal advisor) the current owner’s lease contract.
 What liabilities, including those that may be hidden “off” the balance
sheet, are you buying with a business? Limit liabilities, such as environ-
mental contaminations, through a contract. Conduct legal searches for
liens, litigation, and tax problems.
 What does a background check turn up on the owners and key
employees? Do they have good business experience, or do they have
criminal records and a trail of unpaid debts?
Negotiating a good deal
After you find what you think is a good business and do your homework,
you’re ready to make an offer. Negotiating takes time and patience. Unless
you’re legally savvy, find an attorney who focuses her practice on small-
business dealings. Have an attorney review and work with your contract.
Also consider obtaining input from a qualified tax advisor.
339
Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business

Good advisors can help you inspect what you’re buying and look for red flags
in the company’s financial statements. Advisors can also help structure the
purchase to protect what you’re buying and to gain maximum tax benefits. If
you work with a business broker, use an attorney and accountant as well.
To get a good deal, a number of things need to fall into place.
Valuing a business
How can you buy a business if you don’t know its worth? The price that a
business is listed for is often in excess of — and sometimes grossly so — the
business’s true worth.
Look at what similar businesses have sold for as a starting point for valuing a
business that you want to buy. A smart homebuyer or real estate investor
looks at comparable properties when he’s ready to make an offer.
The challenging part is finding the specific sales price and other information
on businesses that have sold. Small businesses are privately held, and the
terms of sales aren’t a matter of public record. Following are some good
sources for uncovering details of small-business sales:
340
Part IV: Savoring Small Business 
Questioning profits
Don’t blindly take the profit from the bottom line
of a business’s financial statement as the
gospel. As part of your due diligence, ask a tax
advisor to perform an audit after you negotiate
a deal.
Even if the financial statements of a business
are accurate, you (and your tax advisor) must
still look for subtle problems that can make the
profits of the business appear better than they
truly are. The issues that I tell you to look for in
Chapter 6, when you analyze the financial
statements of public companies that issue
stock, also apply to evaluating the financial
statements of small companies.
If necessary, factor out one-time events from
the profit analysis. For example, if the business
last year received an unusually large order that
is unlikely to be repeated and hasn’t been the
norm in the past, subtract this amount from the
profitability analysis. Also, examine the owner’s
salary to see if it’s low for the field. Owners can
reduce their draw to a minimum or pay family
members less than fair market salaries to pump
up the profitability of their company in the years
before they sell.
Also examine whether the rent or mortgage
expense may change when you buy the business.
Consider what will happen to profits when you
factor in your expected rent or mortgage costs.

 Business brokers: If you’re already working with a business broker or
looking at businesses listed with a business broker, the broker should be
able to provide a comparable market analysis of similar businesses that
the broker’s office has sold. Use this analysis as a starting point.
Remember that the more you pay for a business, the more money bro-
kers make. Brokers also generally have access to sales data for only the
small number of similar businesses that their office has sold.
 Businesses that you’ve looked at that have sold: If your search lasts
months or perhaps years, keep track of similar businesses that you’ve
considered that eventually sell. These sales are extra valuable compara-
bles because you may have been able to see the business and obtain
more details about the company’s financial position.
 Advisors: Attorneys, tax advisors, and business consultants you work
with can help provide you with comparables. If an advisor doesn’t have
memories of or experience with similar deals, find another advisor. You
need advisors who can bring applicable experience to the negotiating
table.
 Business appraisers: If you really want to buy a business and your initial
investigation suggests that the seller is committed to and serious about
selling, consider hiring a business appraiser. The Institute of Business
Appraisers (call 954-584-1144 or visit its Web site at www.go-iba.org)
can provide you with a list of association members in your area. Also
check the business-to-business Yellow Pages in your area under
“Appraisers — Business.”
 Research firms and publications: A small number of companies publish
comparable sales information or perform searches for a fee:
• Bizcomps is an annual publication that provides sales price, 
revenue, and other financial details for businesses sold. This 
compendium of sales information is available for different major
regions of the United States (Western, Central, and Eastern edi-
tions). A national edition provides sales information for larger 
manufacturing, wholesale, and service businesses. Call 702-454-0072
for a sample of this publication. Each directory sells for $145, or
you can pay an annual subscription and tap into the Bizcomps
database through its Web site at www.bizcomps.com.
• Financial Research Associates (FRA) provides balance sheet and
income statement comparisons for small companies through its
annual Financial Studies of the Small Business directory, which
sells for $104 (a software version costs $136). Call 863-299-3969 to
receive a background package on this directory or visit the Web
site at www.frafssb.com.
 Trade publications: As I mention earlier in the chapter, trade publica-
tions can help you find information about a particular industry and how
to value companies within the industry. Many publications can, for a
small fee, send you past articles on the topic.
341
Chapter 15: Purchasing a Small Business

When you look at comparables, figure the multiple of earnings that these
businesses sold for. In Chapter 5, I discuss how the price/earnings ratio
works for evaluating the value of larger, publicly traded companies. Because
they’re less well established and riskier from an investment standpoint,
small, privately held businesses sell for a lower multiple of earnings than
comparable, but larger, companies.
Some advisors and business brokers advocate using a multiple of revenue to
determine the value of a business. Revenue is a poor proxy for profitability:
Two businesses in the same field can have identical revenue yet quite differ-
ent profitability because of how well they’re run, the pricing of their products
and services, and the types of customers they attract.
In addition to looking at the sales price of other businesses relative to earn-
ings, you can also consider the value of a company’s assets. The so-called
book value of a company’s assets is what the assets are worth per the com-
pany’s balance sheet. Check these figures to ensure that their asset values
are correct. Another, more conservative way to value such assets is to con-
sider the liquidation/replacement cost.
Using contingencies
When you purchase a home, you make your offer contingent upon satisfac-
tory inspections, mortgage loan approval, and proof that the property seller
legally holds title to the home. When you make a purchase offer for a busi-
ness, you should make your offer contingent upon:
 Due diligence: Make your purchase offer contingent upon a thorough
review of the company’s financial statements and interviews of key
employees, customers, suppliers, and so on. Also, make sure that you
can employ whomever you want to help with these evaluations. You may
also want to defer paying a portion of the purchase price for 6 to 12
months to make sure that everything is as the owner/seller claims.
 Financing: Unless you make an all-cash offer, make finding financing at
an acceptable interest rate another condition of your purchase offer.
(Specify acceptable loan terms, including the maximum interest rate at
which you will go ahead with the purchase.) By the time you make an
offer, you should know whether the seller would loan you money for the
purchase. Check with your area’s banks that specialize in small-business
loans and compare their terms to a loan that the seller offers.
 Limited liability: Make sure that the seller is liable for environmental
cleanup and undisclosed existing liabilities (debts).

Part IV: Savoring Small Business 

 Noncompete clause: You don’t want to buy the business and then have
the former owner set up an identical business down the road. Use a non-
compete clause in your purchase offer, which specifies that for, say, two
years, the seller can’t establish a similar business. Also consider asking
the owner to consult with you for 6 to 12 months to make sure that you
tap all of her valuable experience, as well as to transition relationships
with key customers, employees, and suppliers. Consider making the
total purchase price dependent on the future success of the company.
Allocating the purchase price
Unlike when you purchase a home and offer, for example, $200,000 for the
home, when you offer $200,000 for a business you need to break down, or
allocate, the purchase price among the assets of the business and other cate-
gories. The way that you structure your purchase can save you tens of thou-
sands of dollars in taxes.
As a buyer, you’re generally better off allocating as much of the purchase
price as possible to the assets of the business. Why? Because such assets can
generally be depreciated (written off for tax purposes) faster than, say, land,
which is not depreciable, or goodwill, which is depreciated over 15 years. For
tax reasons, the seller’s interests will likely oppose yours. You must report
the purchase of the business and allocation of the purchase price among
business assets on IRS Form 8594. Make sure that you report this informa-
tion, because if you don’t, you can pay a penalty of up to 10 percent of the
amount that you don’t report.
Taking the final steps
With the help of an attorney, you should take these additional steps prior to
closing the purchase of the business:
 Notify creditors of the transfer of ownership. In counties where the 
company does business, a transfer of ownership notice should be 
published in a general-circulation newspaper. If you omit this step, 
unsecured creditors can come after your business if the previous
owner has outstanding debts.
 Check to make sure that no liens are filed against assets of the business
and, if you’re buying real estate, that the property title is clear.
 Get the seller to provide proof certifying that federal and state employ-
ment, sales, and use taxes are all paid up.

E
verywhere you turn these days, you’re bombarded
with investing tidbits, sound bites, trivia, advice, and
opinions. In this important part, I help you to evaluate the
reliability of a given source. Whether you’re reading a
magazine or newspaper article or book, perusing an
Internet site, using software, watching television, or listen-
ing to the radio, you need to know how to evaluate what’s
worth considering and what to ignore.

Chapter 16

In This Chapter
 Overcoming information and advice overload
 Evaluating investing resources
I
n the past, finding financial information was much simpler, largely because
the available sources were limited. You could subscribe to publications
such as Kiplinger’s Personal Finance magazine for general money issues and a
local big-city newspaper for daily stock prices. The hard-core, upscale
investor had The Wall Street Journal delivered daily.
Times have changed, though. Today’s investor faces information overload.
Radio, television, magazines, newspapers, books, the Internet, family, friends,
neighbors, and cabdrivers — everywhere you turn, someone is offering
investing opinions, tips, and advice. You can’t pick up a newspaper or maga-
zine or turn on the television or radio without bumping into articles, stories,
segments, and entire programs devoted to investment issues. You don’t pay
(directly) for most of this information, and unfortunately, you usually get
your money’s worth! Much of the financial advice out there is biased and
wrong.
Chosen wisely, the best investing resources can further your investment
knowledge and enable you to make better decisions. Because investment
information and advice is so widespread, and constantly growing, knowing
how to sift through it is just as important as hearing what the best resources
are today. Throughout the rest of the book, I name the best investment
resources that I’m familiar with, but in this chapter, I explain how you can
separate the good from the mediocre and awful yourself.
Dealing with Information Overload
Early in the year 2000, one of my clients, Roseanne, called me in a near panic.
“Eric, I’m not satisfied with my investments. Why are so many of my friends
doubling and tripling their money in technology stocks and my mutual funds

are going nowhere? Everywhere I turn, people are talking about these high-
growth companies. I want my piece of the pie, too!” I explained to her that
many of her diversified mutual funds held some technology stocks as well as
stocks in many other industries. I also reminded her that because she was
nearing 50 years of age, she had a healthy helping of bonds in her portfolio 
as well.
She urged me to put her money in some technology stocks and technology-
focused funds, but I stood my ground. I further encouraged her to read this
book (the second edition was out at the time), wherein I highlighted technol-
ogy stocks as a bubble waiting to burst (see Chapter 5). I’m glad that Roseanne
followed my advice, and now, years later, she is, too. During the severe stock
market decline in the early 2000s, technology stocks got clobbered, but other
market segments (such as bonds and value-oriented stocks) actually increased
in value.
A major reason that so many people were talking about making money with
technology stocks was that so many media outlets (radio, television, Web
sites, and so on) were talking about these investments and other personal
money management issues around the clock. Why is everybody in the media
and publishing world putting out investing information? Has money become
that much more complicated over the years? Are there simply more media
and publishing executives who want to help us?
The following list explains some of the reasons why investing has become
such a hot topic:
 Communications options are expanding. Over the past generation, the
number of television channels has mushroomed as a result of cable tele-
vision. Flip through your cable channels at any hour of the day, and you
see infomercials that promise to make you a real estate tycoon or stock
market day trader in your spare time. The explosion of the Internet has
introduced a whole new medium. Now, at a relatively low cost, anybody
can publish a Web page.
The accessibility of these communications mediums allows just about
anyone with an animated personality and a few bucks appear to be an
expert. These newer communications options are primarily structured
around selling advertising rather than offering quality content.
 Economic change breeds uncertainty. Global competition and technolog-
ical advances are causing most industries to undergo dramatic changes in
much shorter periods of time. Although jobs are relatively plentiful for
many with particular training and skills, fear of job loss and financial insta-
bility run high. Economic change and widespread cynicism about the abil-
ity of Social Security to provide a reasonable retirement income to baby
boomers has also caused many to seek investment guidance.
348
Part V: Investing Resources 

 Investment choices and responsibilities are increasing. More employees
are forced to take responsibility for saving money for their retirement and
deciding how to invest that money. In the past, more employers offered
pension plans. In these plans, the employer set aside money on behalf of
employees and retained a pension manager who decided how to invest it.
All the employees had to do was learn the level of benefits that they had
earned and when they could begin drawing a monthly check.
With today’s retirement plans, such as 401(k)s, employees need to edu-
cate themselves about how much money they need to save and how to
invest it. In addition to mastering retirement planning and investment
allocation, individuals face a dizzying number of financial products, such
as the thousands of mutual funds that are on the market.
 Our society is too money focused. The pages of tabloid papers and maga-
zines are filled with highly paid movie and sports celebrities and wealthy
corporate executives. Other warning signs abound for a society that cares
more about money than people and human relationships. Some people
view hiring someone else to raise their children as a luxury of wealth.
Others spend tens of thousands of dollars on fancy, financed cars that
require years of work to pay off. We don’t spend enough time with our
children and then are puzzled why the teen suicide rate has tripled in the
past two generations and why violence is on the rise.
Read the next section to find out how you can filter out the best information
and advice and skip the rest.
Separating Financial Fact from Fiction
As the late Carl Sagan said in The Fine Art of Baloney Detection, “Finding the
occasional straw of truth awash in an ocean of confusion and bamboozle
requires intelligence, vigilance, dedication and courage. But if we don’t prac-
tice these tough habits of thought, we cannot hope to solve the truly serious
problems that face us — and we risk becoming a nation of suckers, up for
grabs by the next charlatan who comes along.”
Just because more sources offer investing advice doesn’t mean that you
should read, listen to, or watch much of it. In this section, I offer prescrip-
tions for how to intelligently choose among all the available financial content.
349
Chapter 16: Selecting Investing Resources

Understanding how advertising 
distorts the facts
The first rule for maximizing your chances of finding the best investing infor-
mation and advice is to recognize that there are no free lunches. Too many
people get sucked into supposedly free resources.
The Internet is packed with scores of “free” investing sites. Turn on your tele-
vision or radio and you come across mountains of “free” stuff. Of course,
someone is paying for all this “free” content, and it’s all there for some reason.
Most of the free Internet sites are run by investment companies or someone
else with something to sell. What these sites give away is nothing but subtle
and not-so-subtle advertising for whatever products and services they sell.
Advertising also foots the bill in the vast majority of cases involving free
investment advice on TV and radio.
As I discuss in Chapter 18, many investing and personal finance books aren’t
free from subtly veiled advertising aims, either. Some authors choose to write
books that are the equivalent of an infomercial for something else — such as
high-priced seminars — that the “author” really wants to sell. Such writers
aren’t interested in educating and helping you as much as they are seeking to
sell you something. So, for example, an author might write about how compli-
cated the investing markets are and what indicators he follows to time invest-
ments. However, at the end of such a book, the author might say that investing
is simply too complicated to do on your own and that you really need a per-
sonal investment manager — which, to no great surprise, the author happens
to be.
Whether in print or on the Internet, television, or radio — and whether it’s
overt or subtle — advertising often compromises the quality of the invest-
ment advice it accompanies.
I won’t say that you can’t find some useful investment resources in mediums
with lots of advertising. You can find some good investing programs on radio
and television and some helpful investing sites on the Internet. However,
these resources are the exception to the rule that where there’s lot of adver-
tising, there’s little valuable information and advice. Likewise, just because
magazines and newspapers have quite a bit of advertising doesn’t mean that
some of their columnists and articles aren’t worthy of your time.
In the following sections, I outline the problems that advertising can cause
within all the media outlets.
350
Part V: Investing Resources 

Influencing content
Many organizations, such as newspaper and magazine publishers and radio
and television stations that accept ads, say that their ad departments are
separate from their editorial departments. The truth, however, is that in most
of these organizations, advertisers wield influence over the content. At a min-
imum, the editorial environment must be perceived as conducive to the sale
of the advertiser’s product.
The stock market cable television channels, for example, carry many ads
from brokers catering to investors who pick and trade their own stocks.
Furthermore, such stations carry ads from firms that purport to teach you
how to make big bucks day trading (see Chapter 5). Not surprisingly, such
stations offer many “news” segments on their shows that cater to stock
traders and condone and endorse foolish strategies, such as day trading,
instead of condemning them. Instead of asking themselves what is in the best
interests of their viewers, listeners, and readers, executives at too many
media and publishing firms ask what will attract attention and advertisers.
Corrupting content
In most organizations, advertisers can have a direct and adulterating influ-
ence on editorial content. Specifically, some media organizations and publish-
ers simply won’t say something negative about a major advertiser or will
highlight and praise investment companies that are big advertisers.
More than a few publications have attempted to edit out critical comments
that I’ve made about companies with lousy products that turned out to be
advertisers in their publications. Some editors simply say that they don’t
want to bite the hand that feeds them. Others are less candid about why they
remove such criticism. The bottom line is still the same: Advertisers’ influ-
ence squashes freedom of speech and, more importantly, prevents readers,
viewers, and listeners from getting the truth and best advice. (By the way, I
don’t write for organizations that edit my work in such a fashion.)
Low-quality content
Because of the previously mentioned reasons and an overall lack of concern
for the value of information and advice, some investing resources cut corners
on the quality of their content. Because consumers often pay nothing or next
to nothing for many investment resources, the media have an incentive to
sell advertising space and not to hire high-quality writers who can offer
sound advice to readers.
351
Chapter 16: Selecting Investing Resources

Recognizing quality resources
With the tremendous increase in the coverage of investing and other per-
sonal money issues, more and more journalists are writing about increasingly
technical issues — often in areas in which they have no expertise. Some of
these writers provide good information and advice. Unfortunately, some dish
out bad advice. In fields such as medicine or the law, you wouldn’t be so will-
ing to take advice from non-experts. Why should you care any less about
your money?
How can you know what’s good and whom you can trust? Although I can sug-
gest resources that I hold in high regard (and do so throughout this book,
especially in Chapters 17, 18, and 19), I recognize that you may encounter
many different investment resources and you need to understand how to tell
the best from the rest. The answer to the question, dear reader, rests in edu-
cating thyself. The more knowledgeable you are about sound and flawed
investment strategies, the better able you are to tell good from not-so-good
investment resources.
The best thing to do when you encounter a financial magazine, newspaper,
Web site, or other resource for the first time is to investigate it. The following
sections suggest some investigative work you should do before you take
anyone’s investment advice.
Following the money
All things being equal, you have a greater chance of finding quality content
when subscriber fees account for the bulk of a company’s revenue and adver-
tising accounts for little or none of the revenue. This generalization, of
course, is just that — a generalization. Some publications that derive a rea-
sonable portion of their revenues from advertising have some good columns
and content. Conversely, some relatively ad-free sources aren’t very good.
Figuring out their philosophy and agenda
Readers of my books can clearly understand my philosophies about invest-
ing. I advocate buying and holding, not trading and gambling. I explain how to
build wealth through proven vehicles, including stocks, real estate, and small-
business ownership. My guiding beliefs are clearly detailed on the cheat
sheet in the front of this book.
Unfortunately, many publications and programs don’t make it as easy for you
to see or hear their operating beliefs. You may have to do some homework.
For example, with a radio program, you probably have to listen to at least por-
tions of several shows to get a sense of the host’s investment philosophies.
Warning signs include publications and programs that make investing sound
overly complicated and that imply or say that you won’t succeed or do as well
if you don’t hire a financial advisor or follow your investments like a hawk.
352
Part V: Investing Resources 

Considering whether the information is constructive
Just about everywhere you turn these days — radio, television, and the
Internet — you can get up-to-the-minute updates on financial markets around
the globe. Although most investors have a natural curiosity about how their
investments are doing, from my experience, the constant barrage of updates
causes a loss of focus on the big picture. In many cases, publishing and
media companies report what I call the “noise” rather than the news of the
day. Some companies are far worse about doing so than others.
Over the next week, take a close look at how you spend your time keeping up
with financial news and other information. Do the programs and publications
that you most heavily use really help you better understand and map out
sound investment strategies, or do they end up confusing, overwhelming,
and paralyzing you with bits and pieces of contradictory and often hyped
noise? I’m not saying that you should tune these resources out completely,
but I am saying that you should devote less time to the noise of the day and
more time to self-education. How can you do that? Read a few good books (a
topic that I discuss in detail in Chapter 18).
Considering their qualifications
Examine the backgrounds, including professional work experience and educa-
tion credentials, of a resource’s writers, hosts, and/or anchors. If such infor-
mation isn’t given or easily found, that’s usually a red flag. People with
something to hide, or a lack of something significantly redeeming to say
about themselves, usually don’t promote their backgrounds.
Of course, just because someone seems to have a relatively impressive back-
ground doesn’t mean that she has your best interests in mind or has honestly
presented her qualifications. For example, Forbes journalist William P. Barrett
was skeptical of Suze Orman’s publisher’s claim that Orman (author of sev-
eral books, including The 9 Steps to Financial Freedom) had 1,000 new clients
per year. He investigated and presented a sobering review of financial author
Orman’s stated credentials and qualifications in Forbes magazine — revealing
that they were largely exaggerated. A writer for The San Francisco Chronicle
later substantiated this fact.
So what’s the lesson to be learned from this story? You can’t accept stated
credentials and qualifications at face value, for the simple reason that some
people don’t tell the truth. You can increase your chances of being tipped off
to hucksters by being skeptical. In fact, Barrett started his investigation of
Orman by the sheer outrageousness of the number of new clients that Orman
claimed to be getting each year.

A
ll the news that’s fit to print or broadcast — newspapers, magazines,
newsletters, and radio and television programs inundate us with invest-
ing information and advice. In this chapter, I explain what to look for — and
what to look out for — when you tune in to these media sources in the hopes
of investing better.
The Printed Word: Magazines 
and Newspapers
Visit a newsstand, and you find many investing publications as well as gen-
eral interest publications with investing columns. I’ve written investing arti-
cles for various magazines and newspapers. Some of the experiences have
been enjoyable, others okay, and a few miserable. The best publications and
editors I’ve written for take seriously their responsibility to provide quality
information and advice to their readers.
Taking the scribes to task
In this section, I discuss the problems with magazine and newspaper invest-
ment articles.

Highlighting hype and horror
Whenever the stock market suffers a sharp decline, many in the media bring
out the gloom and doom. Front-page headlines such as “The Beginning of the
End” torment investors about holding on to their stocks. An avalanche of
such articles, like that seen in late 2002 and early 2003, often coincides with a
bottoming stock market.
Another particularly popular subject for such reporting is the cost of a college
education. (See, you can write a sentence about the cost of education without
including the word skyrocketing.) Scores of articles horrify parents with esti-
mates of the expected costs associated with sending Junior to campus. The
typical advice: Start saving and investing early so that you don’t have to tell
Junior that you can’t afford to send him to college.
Cost-of-college stories typify another failing of the horror stories. The horror
is the story, and the accompanying advice can be shortsighted. Completely
overlooked and ignored are the tax and financial aid consequences of the rec-
ommended investment strategies. For example, if parents don’t take advan-
tage of tax-deductible retirement accounts and instead save outside them,
they not only pay more in taxes but also generally qualify for less financial
aid. Sound investing decisions require a holistic approach that acknowledges
that people have limited money and must make these sorts of trade-offs.
Offering poor advice
To sell their publications, magazines and newspapers sometimes entice read-
ers with promises of high returns. This can easily lead to crummy advice.
Consider the gaffe made by a Money magazine piece entitled “Where to get
safe, high yields.” The title itself should have been a red flag: It’s impossible
to find a safe high yield. To get high yields, you must be willing to accept
more risk. In the Money article, three of the recommended investments were
limited partnerships (LPs) sold through commission-based brokers. These
products’ high commissions and ongoing fees doomed even the luckiest of
investors to mediocre or dismal investment returns.
The Money article even asserted that investors could earn annual returns as
high as 18 percent on some LPs. Students of the financial markets know that
the best ownership investments, such as stocks and real estate, return no
more than 10 to 12 percent per year over the long haul. To expect more is to
hold unrealistic expectations.
Quoting experts who are not
Historically, one way that journalists have attempted to overcome technical
gaps in their knowledge is to interview and quote financial experts. Although
this may add to the accuracy and quality of a story, journalists who aren’t
experts themselves have difficulty telling qualified experts from hacks. (See
Chapter 16 for a discussion on examining the qualifications of writers who
offer up financial guidance.)
356
Part V: Investing Resources 

One glaring example of this phenomenon that continues to amaze me is how
many newspaper and magazine financial writers quote unproven advice from
investment newsletter writers. As I discuss in the section “Investment
Newsletters,” later in this chapter, the predictive advice of many newsletter
writers is often wrong and causes investors to earn lower returns and missed
investment gains due to frequent trading than if they simply bought and held.
Journalists who simply parrot this type of information and provide an
endorsement that unqualified sources are “experts” do readers an immense
disservice.
Focusing on noise and minutiae
Daily financial press writers also contribute to today’s shortsighted invest-
ment environment and encourage readers to adopt similarly misguided out-
looks. It’s common for daily newspaper charts to show the stock market’s
movements at five-minute intervals throughout the previous day. This focus
on the noise of the day causes nervous investors to make panicked, emotion-
ally based decisions, such as deciding to sell after major stock market falls.
Of course, the daily print media aren’t the only ones chronicling the minutiae.
As I discuss elsewhere, other media, including television, radio, and the
Internet, cause many investors to lose sight of the long term and the big 
picture.
The short length of newspaper and magazine articles can easily lead writers
to oversimplify complex issues and offer flawed advice. For example, some
pieces on mutual funds focus on a fund’s returns and investment philoso-
phies, devoting little, if any, space to the risks or tax consequences of invest-
ing in recommended funds.
Making the most of periodicals
So what should you do if you want to find out more about investing but don’t
want to be overloaded with information? Educate yourself and be selective. If
you’re considering subscribing to financial publications, go to the library first
and review some old issues. Was the information and advice useful and error
free? The more you know, the easier it is to separate the wheat from the chaff.
Shy away from publications that purport to be able to predict the future —
few people can, and those who can are usually busy managing money.
Unfortunately, as the financial markets got more volatile in the late 1990s and
early 2000s, I witnessed more and more publications promoting columnists
and headlines that attempted to prognosticate the future.
357
Chapter 17: Perusing Periodicals, Radio, and Television

Read bylines and biographies and get to know writers’ strengths and weak-
nesses. Ditto for the entire publication. Any writer or publisher can make
mistakes. Some make many more than others — follow their advice at your
own peril. Start by evaluating advice in the areas that you know the most
about. For example, if you’re interested in investing in Microsoft or Intel and
are reasonably familiar with the computer industry, find out what the publi-
cations say about technology investments.
And remember that you’re not going to outfox the financial markets, because
they’re reasonably efficient (see Chapter 4). Spend your time seeking out
information and advice that help you flesh out your goals and develop a plan
rather than trolling for the next hot stock tip or worrying about short-term
trends.
Radio and Television Programs
As you move from the world of magazines and newspapers to radio and tele-
vision, the entertainment component usually increases. In this section, I high-
light some common problems with radio and television programs and offer
some recommendations for the better programs.
Looking at problems with radio 
and television programs
I’ve been a guest on hundreds of radio and television programs. Just as
Dorothy discovered in The Wizard of Oz, seeing how things work behind the
scenes tends to deglamorize these mediums. Here are the main problems
I’ve discovered from my years observing radio and television.
You often get what you pay for
Some of the worst financial advice is brought to you, not surprisingly, for
“free.” Nationally, thousands of radio stations have financial and money talk
shows. Money and investing shows are proliferating on television cable chan-
nels. Because listeners don’t pay for these shows, advertising often drives
who and what gets on the air, as I discuss in Chapter 16. But I’ve found that
some of the worst offenders are local — and even national — radio advice
programs.
Some of these shows are “hosted” by a person who is nothing more than a
financial salesperson. That person’s first, and sometimes only, motivation for
358
Part V: Investing Resources 

wanting to do the show is to pick up clients. Many local radio investing pro-
grams are hosted by a local stockbroker (who usually calls himself a financial
consultant or planner). A broker who reels in just one big fish a month — a
person with, say, $300,000 to invest — can generate commissions totaling
$15,000 by selling investments with a 5 percent commission.
But radio suffers from more than brokers trolling for new clients, as evi-
denced by the case of Sonny Bloch, a New York radio personality who was
indicted for fraud. The Securities and Exchange Commission found that Bloch
was receiving kickbacks from investment brokers for endorsing some pretty
crummy investment products on his nationally syndicated radio show. The
SEC also filed a complaint against Bloch for defrauding investors of millions
of dollars to supposedly purchase some radio stations. Instead, according to
the SEC, Bloch and his wife used hundreds of thousands of dollars to pur-
chase a condominium. Partners in a precious metals firm (DeAngelis Brothers
Collectibles) that Bloch regularly endorsed on the air were arrested for theft
and ended up in bankruptcy. Again, Bloch was accused of receiving kick-
backs.
I know from personal experience what too many radio stations look for in the
way of hosts for financial programs. The host’s integrity, knowledge, and lack
of conflict of interest don’t matter. Willingness to work for next to nothing
helps: One radio station program director told me that she liked the broker
who was hosting a financial talk show because the broker was willing to work
for so little compensation from the radio station. Never mind the fact that the
broker rarely gave useful advice and was obviously trolling for new clients.
That didn’t matter to the program director, who told me, “We’re in the enter-
tainment business.”
Information and hype overload
The opening bell will sound in 5 minutes, 32 seconds on the floor of the New
York Stock Exchange. A digital clock counts down the seconds on-screen as
CNBC reporter Maria Bartiromo crams sound bite after sound bite into her
monologue.
The previous day, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan made an
unexpected 0.25 percent cut in the Fed Discount Rate, and stocks jumped
sharply. Now, on the morning after, CNBC tries to pump this short-term
excitement for all it’s worth. Bartiromo talks so frenetically that she has to
continually brush her hair back every time she whips her head around. Like 
a runner near the end of a sprint, she’s practically out of breath. Although
Bartiromo is technically “reporting,” her real job is to keep CNBC viewers
glued to their TV screens for the opening of the world’s biggest stock market.
359
Chapter 17: Perusing Periodicals, Radio, and Television

At 9:30 a.m. EST the market opens, and transactions start streaming across
the bottom of the television screen. Changes in the major market indexes —
the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the NASDAQ index —
also flash on the screen. In fact, these indexes are updated almost every five
seconds on the screen. Far more exciting than a political race or sporting
event, this event never ends and offers constant change and excitement.
Even after the markets close, reporting of still-open overseas markets contin-
ues. The performance of futures of U.S. stock market indexes then appears on
CNBC.
All this reporting and data don’t make us better investors. Although the con-
ventionally accepted notion is that this information overload levels the play-
ing field for the individual investor, I know too many investors who make
emotionally based decisions prodded by all this noise, prognostication, opin-
ion, and hearsay.
Poor method of guest selection
Some journalists, often in an effort to overcome their own lack of knowledge,
like to interview “experts.” A classic example of this problem is the media
exposure that author Charles Givens used to receive. Givens became a dar-
ling of the media and the public following unprecedented, consecutive three-
day appearances on NBC’s Today show.
“When Charles Givens talks, everyone listens,” said Jane Pauley, then co-host
of the Today show. Bryant Gumbel, the other co-host, said of Givens, “Last
time he was here, the studio came to a complete stop. . . . Everyone started
taking notes, and I was asking for advice.” Givens regularly held court on the
talk show circuit with the likes of Larry King and Oprah Winfrey.
The Givens case highlights some of the media’s inability to distinguish
between good and bad experts. It’s relatively easy for the financially sophisti-
cated to see the dangerous, oversimplified, and biased advice that Givens
offers in his books. In his first best-seller, Wealth Without Risk, Givens recom-
mended investing in limited partnerships and provided a phone number and
address of a firm, Delta Capital Corporation in Florida, where readers could
buy the partnerships. Those who bought these products ended up paying
hefty sales commissions and owning investments worth half or less of their
original value. Besides the problematic partnerships he recommended, court
proceedings against Givens in a number of states have uncovered that he
owned a major share of Delta Capital.

Other investing advice from Givens that gives pause: In his chapters on
investing, he said that the average yearly return you’ll earn investing in
mutual funds will be 25 percent or 30 percent on discounted mortgages. The
reality: An investor would be fortunate to earn half of these inflated returns.
So how did Givens get on all these national programs? He had a shrewd publi-
cist, and the show producers either didn’t read his books and/or were them-
selves financially illiterate. Talk shows and many reporters often don’t take
the time to check out people like Givens. Most of the time, the books are
never read. Producers, who themselves are usually financially illiterate, often
decide to put someone on the air on the basis of a press kit or a call from a
publicist.
Picking the best investing programs
Even though I warn you about problems associated with radio and television
investing advice, you can find some good programs and hosts among the bad
apples. The following are my picks for the best of the lot:
 Money Talk: Bob Brinker’s ABC radio program airs weekend afternoons
in most parts of the country. Brinker is an advocate of investing in
mutual funds. The one area where Brinker and I disagree is that he does
advocate market timing — he puts out a newsletter called MarketTimer,
whose investment picks haven’t performed as well as the market aver-
ages over the long term. That said, Brinker does help listeners stay
focused on the big picture and headed in generally the right direction.
 Marketplace Money: This weekly PBS radio program airs on hundreds
of public radio stations around the country. Chris Farrell co-hosts this
outstanding program with Kai Ryssdal.
Investment Newsletters
Particularly in the newsletter business, prognosticators fill your mailbox with
promotional material making outrageous claims about their returns. Private
money managers, not subject to the same scrutiny and auditing requirements
as mutual funds, can do the same.
361
Chapter 17: Perusing Periodicals, Radio, and Television

Be especially wary of any newsletters making claims of high returns. Stephen
Leeb’s Personal Finance newsletter, for example, claims that he has devel-
oped a brilliant proprietary model, which he calls the “Master Key Indicator.”
His model supposedly has predicted the last 28 upturns in the market in a
row without a single miss. The odds of doing this, according to Leeb, are
more than 268 million to 1! The ad goes on to claim that Leeb’s “Master Key”
market-timing system could have turned a $10,000 investment over 12 years
into $39.1 million, a return of 390,000 percent!
Turns out that this outrageous claim was based on backtesting, looking back
over historic returns and creating “what if” scenarios. In other words, Leeb
didn’t turn anyone’s $10,000 into $39 million. Much too late after that ad
appeared, the SEC finally charged Leeb with false advertising. Leeb settled
out of court for a mere $60,000 fine (far less than he cost investors).
According to the Hulbert Financial Digest, the worst investment newsletters
have underperformed the market averages by dozens of percentage points;
some would even have caused you to lose money during a decade when the
financial markets performed extraordinarily well. Newsletter purveyor Joe
Granville, for example, has long been known for making outrageous and
extreme stock market predictions and is often quoted in financial publica-
tions. He claims to have the number-one-rated newsletter — omitting to men-
tion that it was number one for one year only (in 1989). Over the subsequent
decade — one of the best decades ever for the stock market (with U.S. stocks
more than quadrupling in value) — followers of Granville’s advice lost 99 per-
cent of their investments!
Be highly suspicious of past investment performance claims made by invest-
ment newsletters. Don’t believe a track record unless a reputable accounting
firm with experience doing such audits has audited it. In order for you to
make sound investing choices, you don’t need predictions and soothsayers. 
If you choose to follow these and you’re lucky, little harm will be done. But
more often than not, you can lose lots of money following their predictions.
Stay far away from publications that purport to be able to tell what’s going to
happen next. No one has a crystal ball.

Chapter 18
Separating the Best from the 
Rest: Investment Books
In This Chapter
 Recognizing that some books advertise more than they educate
 Being skeptical about authors’ claimed returns
 Presenting my favorite investing books
O
ver the years, I’ve read hundreds of investing and financial books. I
hope you haven’t subjected yourself to this task!
Although most books have something to offer, too many investing books are
burdened with biased, wrongheaded advice and misinformation. As a non-
expert, you may have a hard time sifting through the dung heap for the tid-
bits of treasure. The bad stuff can pollute your otherwise intelligent thinking
and cause you to make investing mistakes that millions before you have
made.
I hope that I’m not the first person to tell you not to believe everything you
read. Publishing is no different from any other business — companies are in
it to make money. As with other industries, the shortsighted desire to reap
quick profits causes some companies to publish content that seems attrac-
tive in the short term but is toxic to readers in the long term. In this chapter, I
help you sift through the confusion to find books worth reading.
Beware of Infomercials 
Disguised as Books
The worst books tend to confuse more than they convey. Why would an
author want to do that? Well, some authors have an incentive to make things
complicated and mysterious. Their agenda may be to sell you a high-priced
newsletter or convince you to turn your money over to them to manage.

One book author said to me, “Royalties, schmoyalties . . . I write books to
hook people into my monthly newsletter. I can make $185 per year off of a
$195 newsletter sale. You can’t do that with a book.” You sure can’t. However,
this author isn’t content to just turn out books that are short on information
and advice but long on pitches to keep up with the latest market develop-
ments through his newsletter. When you subscribe to his newsletter, you’re
told that the financial markets are so complicated and rapidly changing that
the newsletter is really no substitute for using his money-management service!
The worst books steer you toward purchasing a crummy investment product
that the author has a vested interest in selling you. Unfortunately, most pub-
lishers don’t do their homework to check out prospective authors. They
don’t care what the author is up to, or whether the author is really an expert
on the topic, as long as she’s willing and able to write a salable book. Authors
who run around the country conducting seminars are a plus to the publisher.
In his books and seminar promotional materials, Wade Cook claimed to be
able to teach people how to earn monthly returns of 20 percent or more
(that’s right — monthly, not yearly) by using his stock market investing
strategies.
Cook’s self-published best-selling books were short on specifics and were
largely infomercials for his high-priced seminars. Cook’s get-rich-quick invest-
ment seminars — which cost a whopping $4,695 — had been so successful at
attracting attendees that Cook’s company, Profit Financial Corporation, went
public and generated more than $100 million in revenues annually! Cook
wasn’t shy about promising people they can get rich quick without much
effort. Here’s a passage from his book Stock Market Miracles:
I want millions of dollars and I don’t want to have to work a 9 to 5 job to
get them. Boy, that’s a conundrum. It’s almost impossible to work a typi-
cal American job, with average income and accumulate millions. Yes, in
40 to 50 years maybe, but who wants to wait that long? That’s the rub —
accomplishing the task of having millions without having to work for 
millions.
You see my method is simple. I want to use a small amount of money —
risk capital if you will — to generate cash flow which will exponentially
generate more income.
Cook promised his followers several hundred percent annualized returns by
teaching them how to successfully gamble (not invest) in the stock market.
Cook’s “techniques” included trading in and out of stocks and options on
stocks after short holding periods of weeks, days, or even hours.
364
Part V: Investing Resources 

Cook’s trading strategies were loosely based upon technical analysis — that
is, examining a stock’s price movements and volume history through chart-
ing. (See Chapter 6 for more details on the foolishness of technical analysis.)
More best-selling books appeared in the late 1990s and early 2000s touting
how people could get rich day-trading stocks, which is quite similar to Cook’s
recommended approach.
With the booming stock market during the 1990s, some people earned higher-
than-average (10 percent) annualized returns. But Cook’s investment seminar,
which was offered in cities throughout the country, was marketed to folks like
this: “If you aren’t getting 20 percent per month, or 300 percent annualized
returns on your investments, you need to be there.”
Steven Thomas, a truck driver, went to a seminar with his wife so that both of
them could follow and implement Cook’s strategies. In addition to spending
$4,695 on the seminar, they also spent another $2,000 on audiotapes and
videotapes. Six months later, Steven spent $1,500 on a paging system from
Cook’s company. The results: Thomas eventually lost $36,000 on investments
made following Cook’s strategies, which he borrowed against his home’s
equity. “I saw this as an opportunity to quit my job and just invest in the
stock market,” says Thomas. “This has had a terrible impact on my family,
and I’m super depressed.”
Of course, if Cook had indeed earned the 300 percent annual returns his semi-
nars claimed to be able to teach the masses how to achieve, he would have, in
about a decade, become the world’s wealthiest individual if he had invested
just 1 million of the dollars he supposedly earned in real estate. Look out, Bill
Gates and Warren Buffett! Any investor starting with just $10,000 would vault
to the top of the list of the world’s wealthiest people in about 15 years if
Cook’s teachings really worked!
So how did Cook get his start in the investing world? Here’s what his Web site
said:
He was a taxicab driver in the ’70s. Borrowing $500 from his father, Wade
Cook started buying real estate. His innovative ideas and gutsy follow-
through enabled him to turn that $500 into several million. But that’s noth-
ing compared with what he’s doing on Wall Street. Starting with $1,300,
using his “Rolling Rock” and “Range Rider” methods, he’s showing students
how to create millions.
Why is Wade so smart? He says he’s “street smart.” What he discovered
driving a cab changed his life forever. While his fellow cabbies were out
looking for the big runs, Wade was taking every little run he could find —
$4 here, $5 here. You see it costs $2 just to get into a cab (something
called a meter drop) even if you only go two blocks. At the end of a
365
Chapter 18: Separating the Best from the Rest: Investment Books

month, Wade made three times what every other taxicab driver made.
Now, Wade applies his “meter drop”’ technique to his stock market
investment business — making a ton of money on a lot of little deals.
Although Cook’s investment return expectations were completely unrealistic,
he got away with claiming hyped and undocumented returns for many years
because he didn’t manage money for others. Seminar promoters and newslet-
ter writers face no SEC scrutiny of their inflated performance claims or what
they do in their seminars as long as no securities laws are violated. The SEC
refers to such organizations as nonregulated entities.
Of course, Cook wasn’t the first person to profit in this fashion. Numerous
other seminar promoters and authors (some are discussed later in this chap-
ter) have made big bucks as well, including the Beardstown investment club,
which could not document its supposedly market-beating returns of 23 plus
percent per year (see the next section for details). In addition to puffed-up
expected stock market returns, there’s more to Cook’s past than simply dri-
ving a taxi. According to Smart Money magazine, Cook’s dubious business
practices had him in trouble throughout the ’80s. At the end of his real estate
seminars, which touted that average people could become millionaires by
buying property with little money down, Cook began peddling stock in his
own business ventures.
By 1990, state securities regulators in six states — Missouri, Utah, Minnesota,
Illinois, Oregon, and Arizona — issued Cook cease-and-desist orders for sell-
ing securities without a license, selling unregistered securities, and omitting
material facts — like the fact that he had declared bankruptcy in 1987. In fact,
Arizona charged that Cook had duped $390,841 out of 150 investors by selling
unregistered securities, funneling $48,000 of that money into a Scottsdale
home purchase and federal income tax payments. The state ordered him to
pay back the money and slapped him with a $150,000 penalty.
Cook answered by filing bankruptcy (again). Arizona shot back by indicting
Cook on 18 counts of securities fraud. The case has been battled all the way 
to the Supreme Court. Most of the counts were dismissed on a technicality
(double jeopardy); the rest were settled when Cook paid $70,500 in restitution.
Cook then moved back up to his home state of Washington, where he didn’t
lay low for long. His new company, Profit Financial Corporation, became
wildly successful by selling his Wall Street Workshop seminars and publishing
his two stock-picking books. The attorneys general of several states sought
millions of dollars in consumer refunds and sued the company. The states
alleged the company lied about its investment track record. (Now that’s a big
surprise — this company claimed you would make 300 percent per year in
stocks!) Cook’s company settled the blizzard of state and Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) lawsuits against his firm by agreeing to accurately 
366
Part V: Investing Resources 

disclose its trading record in future promotions and to give refunds to cus-
tomers who were misled by past inflated return claims.
Although Profit Financial Corporation was a public company, SEC documents
indicated that it wasn’t exactly shareholder friendly. Cook set up a rather
clever business structure whereby the public company (of which he is the
majority owner) was required to pay him for the right to print his words and
teach his methods. This enabled Cook to funnel much of the revenue stream
directly into his pockets before it ever got to the shareholders. According to
SEC filings, Cook’s total corporate compensation in one year exceeded $8 mil-
lion! According to a recent news report by Bloomberg News, Cook’s firm lost
a whopping 89 percent of its own money trading in 2000. As Deb Bortner,
director of the Washington State Securities Division and president of the
North American Securities Administrators Association, observed, “Either
Wade is unable to follow his own system, which he claims is simple to follow,
or the system doesn’t work.”
Be highly skeptical and suspicious of investing books that direct you to high-
priced seminars and other expensive products and services from the author.
The best investing books, which I recommend later in this chapter, seek to
instruct and educate.
Ignore Unaudited Performance Claims
Book authors avoid careful scrutiny of claims of especially high returns. But if
a performance claim hasn’t been independently audited, ignore it. Remember
also that the stock market, over the long-term, provides annualized returns of
about 10 percent. View skeptically any prognosticator or author claiming sub-
stantially higher returns that sound too good to be true.
Some book publishers are happy to look the other way or even to solicit and
encourage great boasts that they use in the packaging to sell books. Consider
these two examples: The Beardstown Ladies’ Common-Sense Investment Guide:
How We Beat the Stock Market — and How You Can, Too and The Whiz Kid of
Wall Street’s Investment Guide, by Matt Seto.
The Beardstown investment club claimed a whopping 23.4 percent annual
return since the club’s inception in 1983. In the book, the authors advocated
forming an investment club, pooling your money, and using a simple stock
selection method to beat the pants off the market and the suspendered man-
agers of mutual funds. The bulk of this book walked readers through how this
investment club evaluated and selected individual stocks.
367
Chapter 18: Separating the Best from the Rest: Investment Books

Seto’s book boasted, “Matt Seto manages a portfolio that consistently outper-
forms 99 percent of all mutual fund managers . . . and returns an annual aver-
age of 34 percent.” In his book, this 17-year-old investing genius told readers
to forget bonds, real estate, and mutual funds and grow rich by investing
entirely in individual stocks.
Each of these books made prominently displayed and marketed performance
claims. The Beardstown club’s returns and Seto’s returns, versus the market
averages, would’ve placed them shoulder to shoulder with the legendary
Peter Lynch, of the now famous Fidelity Magellan fund, and Warren Buffett, an
investor whom Peter Lynch described as “the Greatest Investor of them all.”
Problem is, neither book contained information as to how these investment
gurus calculated their returns, nor were the authors able to substantiate
their claimed returns when asked to.
When I first wrote about the Beardstown book for The San Francisco
Examiner in 1995, I offered to work with an accounting firm to calculate the
club’s returns if the club supplied the necessary information. I asked the
same of Seto when I read his book. Neither of these authors could supply the
documentation to prove their claims, and they backpedaled when pressed.
Initially, the Beardstown club said it would send the information, but months
passed and it never arrived. The club’s media spokesperson then told me
that the club has “chosen not to make our return an issue. . . . we’re not out
to be bragging.” This statement was surprising, given the claims prominently
plastered all over the book.
A 1998 piece in Chicago magazine proved that although the Beardstown
investment club claimed 23 percent per year returns versus 14 percent for
the market, the club actually tremendously underperformed the market and
earned only 9 percent per year. The publisher of the Beardstown book, Buena
Vista Publishing (which was doing business as Hyperion and Seth Godin
Productions), was ultimately sued. The book publisher settled the lawsuit in
2002. Under the terms of the settlement, buyers of the Beardstown invest-
ment club’s books, audiotapes, or videotapes will receive certificates that can
be redeemed for other books published by Hyperion. (If you were hood-
winked, simply visit the Web site www.beardstownladiessettlement.com
and print out the downloadable claims form.)
Do you think the Beardstown ladies would have gotten their book deal (and
landed on best-seller lists) if the facts had been known? Seto, likewise, couldn’t
prove his claim of an astounding 34 percent return.

Investing Books Worth Reading
Exceptional investing books — ones that are readable, educational, and
insightful — are rare. Some of the better investment books are technical in
nature and are written by career investment folks, so don’t be surprised if
they require more than one read. Make the investment of time; it’ll pay big
dividends (and capital gains!). Following are my picks for books that are
worth the trouble of tracking down and reading.
A Random Walk Down Wall Street
Now in its eighth edition, A Random Walk Down Wall Street (Norton), by
Burton Malkiel, is a classic that was first published in 1973. Malkiel is an
entertaining and intelligent writer. Drawing from examples from this century
and others, Malkiel teaches how speculative bubbles (frenzied buying) and
fear and greed, as well as economic and corporate fundamentals, can move
the financial markets.
One fundamental premise of his book is that the financial markets can’t be
predicted, especially in the short term. Common sense confirms this premise:
If someone could figure out a system to forecast the markets and make a for-
tune, then that person wouldn’t waste time writing a book, publishing a
newsletter, and so on. Malkiel, in fact, is one of the pioneers and proponents
of index mutual funds, which simply invest in a relatively fixed basket of secu-
rities in order to track the overall market performance rather than to attempt
to beat it. (See Chapter 8 to find out about index funds and how to use them.)
Needless to say, many Wall Street types aren’t enamored of this book. As
Malkiel says, the very term random walk is considered an “obscenity.” But
Malkiel presents a mountain of compelling arguments and data to support his
case that most Wall Street firms and their investment research aren’t worthy
of an investor’s hard-earned money. He also convincingly rebukes the whole
field of technical analysis, which purports to be able to predict security
prices based on charting and following past price movements. (See Chapter 6
for more about technical analysis.)
Malkiel explains how to look at some common-sense indicators, such as
whether the stock and bond markets are fairly valued and your own personal
goals and desire to take risk, to develop a thoughtful and successful invest-
ment plan. Instead of trying to predict the future, Malkiel explains how the
level of risk an investor accepts with investments will ultimately determine
future returns.

Stocks for the Long Run
Finance professor Jeremy J. Siegel loves investing data, especially examining
it over long time periods. In Stocks for the Long Run: The Definitive Guide to
Financial Market Returns and Long-Term Investment Strategies, 3rd Edition
(McGraw-Hill), Siegel presents an analysis of U.S. stock and bond returns
since 1802! The book is packed with charts and graphs, some of which you
won’t readily comprehend unless you’re the analytic, graphical sort. Even so,
Siegel provides comprehensive discussion of the worldwide financial mar-
kets. The book focuses on stock market investing, although it also discusses
bonds if for no other reason than to compare their returns and risk to stocks.
Built to Last and Good to Great
Some people may think that Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary
Companies (HarperCollins) is just for the small number of people who want
to build a large company. However, the book, written by management consul-
tant James Collins and Stanford Business School Professor Jerry Porras, is an
excellent book for all entrepreneurs and people who work in leadership posi-
tions in companies, as well as people interested in investing in individual
stocks. Rarely does a great book make it to the business best-seller lists, but
Built to Last did.
The book presents the findings from an extensive six years’ worth of research
into what’s behind the success of companies such as 3M, Boeing, Ford,
Hewlett-Packard, Motorola, Sony, and Wal-Mart, all of which have achieved
great success in their respective industries over many years. The average
company in the Collins and Porras study was founded in 1897. In all, the
authors tracked 18 extraordinary companies (referred to as the gold-medal
winners in their respective industries) and compared the traits of these com-
panies with those of similarly long-lived but less successful peer companies
(in the same industries).
Collins and Porras’s findings not only yield insight into how to build or iden-
tify a great business in which to invest but also destroy some commonly held
myths. For example, some people feel that a great idea is behind every great
company. This concept is wrong, and in fact, according to the authors’
research, companies founded on the basis of a great idea can lead to focusing
on the idea rather than laying the groundwork for building a great company.
Sony’s founder, for example, wrote a nine-page philosophical prospectus set-
ting the stage for this great company, yet he had few product ideas in his
firm’s early days. Early products, such as a rice cooker, failed miserably.

Chapter 18: Separating the Best from the Rest: Investment Books
Can you be like Warren Buffett?
In recent years, Warren Buffett, considered one
of the best investors of all time, has received
lots of attention for his investing prowess.
Numerous books have been published about
him (none by Buffett himself). Most of them
were written and promoted based on the phi-
losophy embodied in the marketing slogan, “He
did it his way; now you can, too,” for the book
The Warren Buffett Way.
You can read every book ever written about
Buffett, and the odds are about 10 million to 1
that you’re going to be able to invest like he
does. It’s not that you’re not an intelligent, will-
ing-to-learn kind of person. But consider that
you can’t invest like Buffett for the same reason
that you can’t discover how to be a professional
basketball player by reading books about bas-
ketball greats Larry Bird and Michael Jordan,
even if they themselves wrote the books.
One financial market commentator said of Buffett
and the financial markets, “If making money in
the market is so easy, why has only Warren
Buffett made $14 billion picking stocks?”
However, Buffett did not make $14 billion picking
individual stocks. It’s true that Berkshire
Hathaway, the firm that Buffett purchased in 1965
and still runs today, makes substantial invest-
ments in the stocks of individual companies. But
Buffett built much of his great wealth through his
buying and managing a variety of businesses,
particularly insurance companies.
In addition to 13 insurance companies, Berkshire
Hathaway owns divisions such as See’s (candy
manufacturer), The Buffalo News (newspaper),
Nebraska Furniture Mart (home furnishings
retailer), Borsheim’s (jewelry retailer), World
Book (encyclopedia publisher), Kirby’s (home
cleaning products manufacturer), Fechheimer
Brothers (uniform manufacturer), and H.H.
Brown and Dexter (shoe manufacturers).
The property and casualty insurance businesses
that Berkshire Hathaway bought afforded Buffett
lots of low-cost money, which his firm could
invest in a tax-favored way. Specifically, insur-
ance companies collect premiums from policy-
holders and invest the money, called float, until
insurance claims need to be paid. Unlike almost
all other insurers, Berkshire Hathaway, which is
in Nebraska, a state with loose insurance com-
pany regulations, can invest much of its float in
riskier investments like stocks.
Although most other insurers invest no more
than 20 percent in stocks, with the remainder in
conservative, boring, low-return bonds, Buffett
has taken full advantage of Nebraska’s loose
regulations, investing at times more than 95 per-
cent of the float in stocks. Buffett likes to buy
name-brand company stock and is attracted to
almost anything that hooks consumers. Witness
his investment in tobacco companies, of which
he said, “I’ll tell you why I like the economics of
the cigarette business. It costs a penny to make.
Sell it for a dollar. It’s habit-forming. And there’s
fantastic brand loyalty.”
The float is also invested in a tax-favored way,
because these reserves compound tax-free and
because the final capital gains are taxed at a
reduced rate, thanks to the protection afforded
insurance companies. Buffett’s insurance opera-
tions have also shrewdly kept their float reserved
from claims at higher-than-needed levels to take
full advantage of these tax benefits.
As Berkshire Hathaway grew over the years,
acquired more businesses, and squirreled away
more money to invest, Buffett’s wealth also bal-
looned, thanks to his 41 percent ownership
stake in the outstanding stock of the company.
So to say that Buffett built his wealth through
stock picking and that you can replicate what
he did simply by reading books is ludicrous!

Great, visionary companies are rigid and unyielding when it comes to
respecting their core ideologies and principles. On the other hand, such com-
panies tinker and experiment to stimulate positive change and innovation.
And despite their often-stunning financial success, great companies usually
have an aspiration higher than or equal to maximizing profits: fulfilling a pur-
pose and being driven by values. This book is packed with insights, informa-
tion, and examples, so don’t expect to absorb all its contents in one reading.
Collins subsequently wrote another outstanding book, Good to Great: Why
Some Companies Make the Leap . . . And Others Don’t (HarperCollins), which
he calls the prequel to Built to Last. In Good to Great, Collins presents the
engaging and insightful results of another long-term study of numerous com-
panies that over time moved from being average companies to outstanding
companies. As with Built to Last, this newer book can assist readers not only
with managing their own small businesses but also with selecting companies
to invest in.
Mutual Funds For Dummies
Okay, I’m a tad biased about Mutual Funds For Dummies (Wiley), which I
wrote! However, it’s the perfect complement to this book because it details
how to build and manage a stock and bond portfolio by using the best mutual
funds. I discuss dozens of the best funds available today and provide sample
portfolios for investors in differing situations.

Investigating Internet and
Software Resources
In This Chapter
 Choosing investing software
 Recognizing Internet pitfalls and opportunities
 Finding the best investing Web sites
T
housands of investing software packages and Web sites claim to enable
you to more easily make profitable investments. As with most other
advertising claims, the reality of using your computer for investing and other
tasks falls short of the promises and the hype.
In this chapter, I show you ways that your computer may help you with your
investing challenges and chores. Throughout this discussion, however,
please remember several important caveats:
 Many highly successful investors don’t use their computers (or use
them infrequently) to manage their investments.
 You may subject yourself to information overload and spend a fair
amount of money without seeing many benefits if you don’t choose
wisely.
 Don’t believe everything that you read, especially in the online world,
where filters and editors are often absent. (Of course, as I discuss else-
where in this book, filters and editors don’t guarantee that you’ll find
quality investment advice and information when you read financial 
publications.)

Seeking Investment Software
Good investment software should be user-friendly and provide quality infor-
mation for making sound decisions. Software that helps you make personal
investment decisions also needs to provide, if applicable, well-founded advice.
Which software is best for you depends on what you’re trying to accomplish,
as well as your level of investment knowledge and computer savvy. Software
can help you with a variety of investment tasks, from tracking your invest-
ments to researching, planning, and placing trades through your computer (a
topic that I discuss in Chapter 9). The following sections help you find the
best software for your needs.
Investment tracking software
Software that can help you with investment tracking falls into one of two
main groups:
 Personal finance software that also includes investment-tracking 
capabilities
 Software that focuses exclusively on investment tracking
The broader personal finance packages such as Quicken and Microsoft
Money are more user-friendly and are probably more familiar if you already
use these packages’ other features (such as a bill-paying feature).
In the following sections, I outline what I see as the advantages and disadvan-
tages of using tracking software based on your needs and offer a few alterna-
tive approaches to tracking your investments.
The benefits
Investment tracking software offers a number of positive features that may
appeal to you:
 Organization: One of the best benefits of these packages is that using
them can help you get organized. If you enter your investments into the
program, the software can help you make sure that you don’t lose track
of your holdings. The fact that investors lose billions of dollars annually
to escheatment — a situation in which financial institutions turn money
over to the state because the owner loses track of his investment (often
because the investor moved or passed away) — is testimony to the dis-
array of some investors’ tracking systems. Of course, if your home burns
374
Part V: Investing Resources 

to the ground and you don’t have a backup copy of your files or software
off-site, you have to start your documentation from scratch.
 At-a-glance access: In addition to organizing all your investment informa-
tion in one place, investment software allows you to track original 
purchase price, current market values, and rates of return on your
investments. If you have accounts at numerous investment firms, using
software can reduce some of the complications involved in tracking your
investing kingdom.
 Overall return data: People usually know their CD and bond yields, but
ask most people investing in individual stocks and bonds what the total
return was on their entire portfolio, and at best, you’ll get a guess. It’s
the rare person who can quote you total returns or tell you whether her
returns are on pace to reach her future financial goals. If someone does
know her investments’ returns, she probably doesn’t know whether that
return is good, bad, or otherwise. Feel good having made 22 percent on
your portfolio of stocks last year? Maybe you wouldn’t if an index of
comparable stocks was up 35 percent over the same period.
Investment tracking software can be more useful for stock traders. In my
experience, stock traders, the people who would most benefit from
using these programs, often don’t track their overall returns. If they did,
they could calculate the benefit (or lack thereof) of all their trading. (I’ve
never worked with a stock picker who completed this exercise with me
and had return numbers that beat the market indexes over the long-term.)
The drawbacks
Many software makers produce programs that claim to solve investment-
tracking quandaries. (Numerous financial Web sites offer tracking tools as
well.) However, investment tracking software isn’t a painless panacea for
investors who want to track their investments and returns.
Many people buy these programs thinking that the programs will, after a
small investment of time, simplify their investment lives. My review of many
investment-tracking packages suggests that you should be prepared to make
a substantial time commitment to find out how to use these packages and
should know that other, less high-tech alternatives may be more efficient and
enlightening. Also know that a good portion of program users tire of entering
all the required data and then feel guilty for “falling behind.”
If you want to see what your investment returns have been over the years, be
aware that entering historic data from your account statements (if you can find
them) is a time-consuming process, regardless of which package you use. In
order to calculate your returns, you generally need to enter each new invest-
ment that you make as well as all your reinvestments of dividends, interest,
and capital gains distributions (such as those made on mutual funds). Ugh!

Chapter 19: Investigating Internet and Software Resources

The alternatives
If you’re not into data entry, here are some alternative routes to consider: 
 Organization: Keeping a current copy of each of your investment state-
ments in a binder or file folder can accomplish the same result of orga-
nizing all of your holdings. 
 At-a-glance access: Investment software can track all the facts and fig-
ures for all of your investments — purchase price, market value, and
rates of return, and so on. But you can accomplish the same things by
consolidating your investments at one investment company. (See my
discussion of discount brokers in Chapter 9.)
 Overall return data: You can easily estimate the return of your overall
portfolio by using an old-fashioned paper and pencil. Simply weight the
return of each investment by the portion of your portfolio that’s invested
in it. For example, with a simple portfolio equally divided between two
investments that returned 10 percent and 20 percent respectively, your
overall portfolio return would be 15 percent (10 × .50 + 20 × .50 = 15). If
you’re not adding to or taking money from a portfolio, you can simply
compare the portfolio’s value at year end to the prior year end.
People who make investments at various times throughout the year and want
to know what their actual returns were during the year can use software to get
answers. Unless you’re a frequent trader and are trying to measure the suc-
cess of your trading, knowing the exact returns based on the precise dates
that you fed money into investments has limited value. This fact is especially
true if you’re a regular, dollar-cost-averaging investor (see Chapter 3). If you’re
a frequent trader, using a financial calculator works as well as software in cal-
culating your returns based on the timing of your investments. Also know that
increasing numbers of investment companies are providing personal return
data via their Web site and/or on account statements.
And if you’re a buy-and-hold mutual fund investor, a path that I find great
value in, tracking software gives you limited benefits because of the time that
entering your data requires. Mutual funds and many other published
resources tell you what a fund’s total return was for the past year, so you
don’t need to enter every dividend and capital gain distribution.
Investment research software
Investment research software packages usually separate investment begin-
ners (and others who don’t want to spend a lot of their time managing their
money) from those who enjoy wallowing in data and conducting primary
376
Part V: Investing Resources 

research. If you already have a plan in mind and just want to get on with
investing, then go to it! But even if you don’t want to conduct more specific
research, some of the packages that I discuss in this section can also help
you conduct online investment transactions and track an investment’s 
performance.
You may have the problems of sifting through too much data and differentiat-
ing the best from the mediocre and the downright awful. And unless cost is
377
Chapter 19: Investigating Internet and Software Resources
Understanding how software calculates returns
Most software programs calculate returns in
one of two ways. First, the programs can calcu-
late your effective or “internal” rate of return
(IRR) by comparing your original amounts
invested to the current market value. Of those
programs that I’ve tested that calculate IRR —
and some don’t — the results were accurate.
After you calculate your returns, knowing how
they compare with relevant market averages
would be nice. Unfortunately, not all programs
allow you to compare your performance to var-
ious market indexes.
The tax or cost-basis method is the second way
software may calculate your returns. All the
packages that I’ve reviewed calculate your cost
basis for accounting purposes. Your cost basis
is your original investment plus reinvested divi-
dends and capital gains, for which you have
already paid taxes in a non-retirement account.
To get an accurate cost basis, you need to key
in all your investments, including reinvested dis-
tributions. Time-starved investors can take
solace in the fact that most investment compa-
nies, particularly larger mutual fund providers,
provide cost basis information for you upon
request or when you sell an investment.
Some packages provide only this cost basis
information and don’t report actual returns. 
Cost basis reports make your returns look less
generous because reinvested distributions
increase your original investment and seem-
ingly reduce your returns. I know from experi-
ence with counseling clients and students who
have taken my courses that investors often look
at cost basis reports and assume that the
reports tell them what their investment returns
are. This happens partly because of the cost
basis reports’ misleading names, such as
“investment performance” or “investment
analysis.”
The difference between the rate of return using
the cost basis and IRR methods is generally
substantial. For the data that I used in my
research, the cost basis method software cal-
culated a 2.7 percent annual return, and the IRR
method software calculated a 13 percent
annual return. The actual portfolio’s total return
was 13 percent, but an investor using a soft-
ware package that calculates only cost basis is
led to believe that her profit was just 2.7 percent
(which is correct for tax purposes only for a
non-retirement account).
Is all this calculation method mumbo jumbo too
technical for your taste? Because they already
have the data on your accounts, more invest-
ment firms can and hopefully someday will be
able to send you your account’s performance
numbers. To date, surprisingly few investment
firms provide personal investment returns.

no object, you need to make sure that you don’t spend too much of your loot
simply accessing the information.
Before you plunge into the data jungle and try to become the next Peter
Lynch or Warren Buffett and pick individual stocks, be honest about your rea-
sons for wanting to research. Some investors fool themselves into believing
that their research will help them beat the markets. Few investors, even so-
called professionals, ever do. Witness the fact that over long time periods
(ten-plus years), mutual funds that invest in a fixed market index, such as the
Standard & Poor’s 500, outperform three-quarters of their actively managed
peers thanks to the index fund’s lower operating expenses (see Chapter 8).
Researching individual securities
If you like to invest in individual securities, the Value Line Investment Survey
for Windows helps you research individual stocks using the data that the
Value Line Investment Survey provides (as I discuss in Chapter 6). This soft-
ware package lets you sift through Value Line’s data efficiently. You can also
use it to track your stock portfolio.
A two-month introductory offer for Value Line’s software costs $75 ($95 for
the “Plus Edition,” which also tracks small- and medium-company stocks),
and an annual subscription costs $598 for monthly updates ($995 for the
more comprehensive version). The software is available from Value Line at
800-654-0508 or by visiting its Web site at www.valueline.com.
Morningstar, which is better known for its mutual fund information, has fol-
lowed in Value Line’s footsteps in providing lots of data on individual stocks.
Morningstar’s Principia Pro for Stocks has data and features equivalent to
what Value Line’s Plus Edition offers. This program is intended for those with
in-depth knowledge of how to analyze stocks and is most definitely not for
beginners. An annual subscription to Principia Pro for Stocks with monthly
updates costs $615. You can reach Morningstar at 800-735-0700 or visit its
Web site at www.morningstar.com. Morningstar offers a number of ways to
tap into the more basic stock data it collects through its Web site, which I dis-
cuss in the next section.
Researching mutual funds
For mutual funds, Morningstar and Value Line both publish a number of 
software packages, the best of which are similar in price to the Value Line
Investment Survey. These packages are geared toward more sophisticated
investors who understand mutual funds and how to select them. For more
details, pick up a copy of the latest edition of my book Mutual Funds For
Dummies (published by Wiley).

Investigating Internet 
Investing Resources
As people interested in managing their money surf the Internet, thousands of
Web sites have sprung up to meet the demand. Although the low barriers to
entry in the online world make it easy for scammers and incompetents to flog
their wares and flawed advice, this relatively new medium can offer some
helpful resources if you know where to look and how to discern the good
from the not-so-good.
The Securities and Exchange Commission shutters numerous online scams,
such as the one run by two individuals (Gene Block and Renate Haag) that
bilked investors out of more than $3.5 million by promising to double investors’
money in four months in a fictitious security they called “prime bank.”
Although you may be smart enough to avoid offers that promise pie in the
sky, you’re far more likely to fall for unsound financial advice. For example, at
the stock-picking Motley Fool site, an online scribe posted a column entitled
“Paying your mortgage off early? Might as well put the money under your
mattress.” In the poorly reasoned piece, this person argues: “If you move
before the mortgage is paid, the money you gave your bank actually saved
you nothing. All your money did is reduce your principal amount by the exact
extra amount you paid. Sounds like a mattress savings account to me.”
However, paying your mortgage balance off faster can be a good investment,
regardless of whether you move. See Chapter 3 for a discussion of the merits
and drawbacks of paying your mortgage off faster.
You can find plenty of self-serving advertorial content and bad advice online,
so you should be wary and cautious. The next section offers tips for evaluat-
ing Internet resources.
Evaluating online resources
Fraud and bad financial advice existed long before the Internet ever came
around. The SEC describes online scams as “new medium, same message.”
The tips in the following sections can help you find the nuggets of helpful
online advice and avoid the land mines.
Checking out agendas
Get an idea of who’s behind a site before you trust its information. When nav-
igating the Internet for investment purposes, remember that financial service
379
Chapter 19: Investigating Internet and Software Resources

companies that want to sell you something erect the vast majority of sites.
Thus, the “free” entrance fee to these sites is driven by companies wanting
you to buy what they’re selling.
Some sites go to extraordinary lengths — including providing lots of informa-
tion and advice and attempting to conceal the identity of the company that
runs the site — to disguise their agendas. Therefore, don’t turn to the Web
for advice or opinions, which usually aren’t objective. Approach online finan-
cial calculators with skepticism. Most are incredibly simplistic and biased.
Many Web sites have icons that you can click on to see some background on
the site’s sponsor and to find out whether the site solicits potential advertis-
ers. With a simple click, you can quickly see that a site purporting to be a 
reference service of the best small-company stocks in which to invest may be
nothing more than an online Yellow Pages of companies that paid the site an
advertising fee. Look for sites that exercise quality control in what they post and
use sensible screening criteria for outside information or companies they list.
Just because every Tom, Dick, and Jane can easily and at relatively low cost
set up an Internet site doesn’t mean that their Web sites and advice are
worthy of your time. Not surprisingly, the financial companies with reputa-
tions for integrity offline are the ones that offer some of the best integrity
online. For example, as I discuss later in this section, the leading and most
investor-friendly investment companies often have the best education-oriented
Web sites.
Soliciting grassroots customer feedback
The Internet can be a useful place to do consumer research. The more
enlightening message board conversations that I’ve encountered start with
someone asking what others thought about particular financial service firms,
such as brokerage firms. If you’re investigating a certain financial service, the
Internet can be an efficient way to get feedback from other people with expe-
rience dealing with that firm.
In order to find a dozen people offline who have done business with a given
firm, you’d probably have to speak with hundreds of people. Online, finding
customers is a snap. Those who feel wronged by a particular firm are more
than willing to share their gripes. As in the offline world, though, don’t
believe everything you hear, and watch out for employees of a given firm who
post flattering comments about their firms and dis the competition.
Verifying advice and information offline
Enhance the value of the online information you gather by verifying it else-
where. You can do some fact checking both online and offline. For example, if
you’re contemplating the purchase of some stock based on financial data that
you read on an investing site, first check out those numbers at the library or
at one of the Web sites I recommend later in this chapter.
380
Part V: Investing Resources 

Lots of Internet investment advice (and most of the scams) focus on smaller
companies and investment start-ups; unfortunately, these are often the most dif-
ficult businesses to locate information about. The SEC requires companies that
are raising less than $1 million to file a Form D. To inquire whether a company
has filed Form D, call the SEC at 202-551-8090. Also check with your state securi-
ties regulator. For contact information for state regulators, you may call the
North American Securities Administrators Association at 202-737-0900 or visit
its Web site at www.nasaa.org/QuickLinks/ContactYourRegulator.cfm.
And if something does sound too good to be true, check out and possibly
report your concerns to Internet fraud-fighting organization sites. In addition
to the SEC’s Web site, check out the National Association of Securities
Dealers Regulation Web site (www.nasdr.com) and the National Consumers
League’s Fraud Information Center (www.fraud.org; 800-876-7060).
The best investment Web sites
Although you can live without the Internet and not suffer any financial or
educational consequences, the quality of what’s on the Internet is gradually
improving, and a handful of sites are setting a high standard.
In addition to the consumer advocacy sites that I recommend earlier in this
chapter, here are my top picks for investing sites worthy of your online time.
381
Chapter 19: Investigating Internet and Software Resources
Look who’s talking
If you’re at a cocktail party and you receive
investing information and advice from someone
you’ve just met, check him out to determine how
much credence you should give to his words.
And no matter how wise he seems, you shouldn’t
judge him on the basis of just one conversation.
In the online world, you need to do the same, but
you may have greater difficulty determining
who’s doing the talking and why. On some
Internet sites, visitors may post comments and
opinions on message boards (the online equiv-
alent of a big bulletin board).
As the National Association of Securities
Dealers (NASD) says on its Web site, “In most
instances, there is simply no way to uncover
someone’s true identity. Are you getting infor-
mation from a broker, short seller, corporate
insider, amateur investor, or stock touter?” You
have to use a little induction and a lot of intu-
ition. Start by eliminating any advice from online
posters who are totally anonymous. Pseudo-
nyms are common online, and some salespeo-
ple try to hide their true identities.
Among the more popular message boards on
the Internet are those where people debate and
discuss the prospects for individual stocks. The
postings play fast and loose with the facts.
“Investors need to understand that, although
they may be reading honest conversations, they
could just as easily be looking at the work of a
corporate insider, stock promoter, or short seller
using an alias to deceive the unsuspecting or to
manipulate the market,” says the NASD
Regulation unit.

The Motley Fools: Online investing geniuses?
David and Tom Gardner, who launched The
Motley Fool (www.fool.com), claim that
novices can “Nearly double the S&P 500 post-
ing returns in excess of 20 percent per year”
and that “You might be able to fish out greater
than 30 percent per year on your own without
assuming considerably greater risk.” They also
say, “It’s not an exaggeration to say that fifth
graders can wallop the market after one month
of analysis. You can too.”
Although they claim to have walloped the
market averages with their stock picks, accord-
ing to research by Investorhome.com, which I
discuss elsewhere in this chapter, only one of
their seven portfolios has actually performed
better than the market averages — two of their
portfolios were shuttered after poor perfor-
mance (one of which plunged 50 percent during
its short six-month existence).
The Fool story is rich in lessons for all consumers
of investment newsletters online (and off):
 Beware of promises of easy riches. To
deter investors from mutual funds, the Fools
say of their stock picking, “We hope to have
put you in position to nearly double the S&P
500 . . . it’ll demand little research per year,
and present you little, if any, long-term risk.”
If investing were that easy, we’d all be rich!
And as any professional money manager
knows firsthand, successfully managing a
portfolio of individual stocks takes time, not
just a few hours per year.
 Beware of bloated performance claims.
The Fools love to compare their integrity
and accountability to the notoriously shady
marketing practices of other financial
newsletters. As the Gardners repeatedly
point out, the Fool portfolio uses real money,
and calculated returns account for trading
commissions. However, their real-money
portfolio is a non-retirement account, and
the Fools fail to calculate and report their
returns taking into account their greatest
investment cost of all: taxes. In fact,
because of trading, the Fools’ one portfolio
that looks like it has beaten the market aver-
ages has performed only on par with what
an investor could have earned, with no
ongoing research time required, in a low-
cost index fund. Ironically, the Gardners
say, “If you can’t beat the index after all
costs are deducted, you’ve blundered.”
By 1996, the Fools were basking in the
media spotlight. However, the deluges of
newcomers to their online site soon found
out about the perils of hitching your invest-
ment cart to a shooting star. Since that time,
a stock that they aggressively promoted —
Iomega — has plunged from $271⁄2 to less
than $4, at which point they sold it. A buy
recommendation for ATC Communications
at $23 proved disastrous when the stock
crashed to less than $4 just one year later,
before the Fools threw in the towel. They
bought Excite@Home for $28 and rode it all
the way down to less than $6 per share
before dumping it.
 Beware of actions that contradict the
newsletter’s stated philosophy. “We invest
for the long-term” is the Fools’ mantra,
invoked in their portfolio report on a regular
basis (almost daily when the portfolio 
performs poorly). They add, “Part of the
enduring beauty of long-term equities
investing is the advantage of buying and
(continued)

383
Chapter 19: Investigating Internet and Software Resources
holding — never touching — stocks like
General Electric, which rack up 20 per-
cent annualized gains over a decade or
more. We’re talking compounded returns
untainted by capital gains taxes.”
The portfolio’s trading history, however, tells
another story. The Fools have sold an aver-
age of about six investment holdings annu-
ally (in a portfolio with typically just ten
stocks) and have held just one stock — in
fact just a portion of the original position —
since their portfolio first started! Moreover,
the Fools engage in risky short selling (and
have lost money overall doing it), where you
sell borrowed stock in the hope that you
can buy it back later at a lower price. If this
is long-term investing, then perhaps the
Fools’ definition of a long-term trader is
anyone who doesn’t day trade!
 Successful investing doesn’t require fol-
lowing the market closely. Buying and
holding index or other quality mutual funds
for many years doesn’t take much review
time — perhaps as little as an hour once
per year to read the fund’s annual report.
Although the Fools rightfully criticize the
financial media’s short-term reporting —
“So many are lost in the day-by-day noise
of stock moves” — the Fools themselves
report on the biggest stock price changes
of the day throughout the trading day. This
daily tracking of stock prices causes
investors to lose sight of the long term and
the big picture (although it draws more vis-
itors to the site, which satisfies advertisers
and enriches the Gardners).
The bottom line? Be skeptical of financial
newsletters, online or off. Like politicians,
they’re out to make themselves look as good as
possible, taking credit when things go well and
blaming external forces when they don’t.
According to Hulbert’s Financial Digest, during
the period that Hulbert has tracked the Fools’
stock picks, they have not performed among the
best newsletters. See Chapter 17 for more about
investment newsletters.

CorporateInformation.com is owned and operated by Wright Investors’

publishes comprehensive reports on thousands of companies around the

many links to other Internet investing information and research sites. This
site also provides plenty of current business news.
Investorhome.com
For a thorough and well-organized listing of lots of investment Web sites,
peruse Investor Home (www.investorhome.com). Created by Gary Karz, CFA,
the site is a reference of many of the best and most popular Internet invest-
ment sites. And for now, at least, the price to use it is right — accessing the
site is free, and you won’t bump into any advertising.

In addition to providing links to many Internet investing sites, Karz has also
drafted a good deal of his own content on various investing topics. Karz is
intelligent and knowledgeable and has great investigative skills and instincts.
For example, he broke the story about how The Motley Fool’s Internet invest-
ment site, which has hyped the performance of some of its stock picks (see
the “The Motley Fools: Online investing geniuses?” sidebar in this chapter),
had hidden some of its earlier model stock portfolios that performed poorly.
Karz’s research on this topic was so thorough and compelling that invest-
ment newsletter evaluator Mark Hulbert picked up on it and wrote an entire
column about The Motley Fool, citing Karz’s original research.
My one disappointment with this site is that in recent years, Karz hasn’t kept
it as updated as he used to. However, you can still find lots of useful informa-
tion and links here.
Morningstar.com
The behemoth of the mutual fund data business, Morningstar has a Web site
(www.morningstar.com) that provides information and tools for mutual fund
and stock research. The basic stuff is free, but to access the analyst reports
and stock research reports, among other premium content, you must pony
up $125 per year. In addition to providing more data than you could ever pos-
sibly digest on funds and stocks, this site includes short, insightful articles
that are useful to more educated investors.
Sec.gov
All publicly held companies and mutual funds must file annual and quarterly
reports and other documents electronically with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC). In the past, the simplest way to access this
information was to pay a private service. Now this information is easily acces-
sible for free (paid for by tax dollars) on the SEC Web site (www.sec.gov).
If you’re researching individual companies, you can find all the corporate
reports — annual reports, 10-Ks, and the like — that I discuss in Chapter 6 via
this Web site. Or you can call the individual companies that interest you and
have them mail you the desired material.
The SEC site isn’t pretty, and searching the Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis, and Retrieval system (EDGAR) database can be challenging, espe-
cially for the novice investor. But if you’re tenacious, you may find something
that’s hard to come by on the Web these days: cold, hard facts and no spin.

Vanguard.com
Few sites run by investment companies are worth visiting unless you’re an
account holder at the firm and you want to review your accounts or conduct
transactions online. The reason: Much of the content is self-serving, biased,
and advertorial in nature. The nation’s second-largest mutual fund company, the
Vanguard Group, operates a site (www.vanguard.com) that is the exception.
Of course, you can find details on Vanguard’s fine family of funds here, but
you also find some of the best educational materials that I’ve seen online. I’m
not surprised — one reason that I’ve long liked the company is that it advo-
cates for investors’ best interests (see Chapter 8).
And if you’re one of the millions of Vanguard shareholders, you can access
your accounts and perform most transactions online. Vanguard has also
expanded its discount brokerage division, also accessible online, to allow for
investing in many other fund companies’ funds (as well as Vanguard’s)
through a single account.

Ten Investing Obstacles 
to Conquer
In This Chapter
 Putting your faith in experts
 Letting your emotions guide your investment decisions
 Giving up when the market takes a plunge
 Ignoring your financial big picture
Just as with raising children or in one’s career, “success” with personal
investing is in the eye of the beholder. In my work as a financial counselor
and lecturer, I’ve come to define a successful investor as someone who, with
a minimal commitment of time, develops an investment plan to accomplish
financial and personal goals and earns returns commensurate with the risk
he’s willing to accept.
In this chapter, I point out ten common obstacles that may keep you from
fully realizing your financial goals and share tips and advice for overcoming
those obstacles on the road to investing success.
Trusting Authority
Some investors assume that an advisor is competent and ethical if she has a
lofty title (financial consultant, vice president, and so on), dresses well, and
works in a snazzy office. Such accessories are often indicators of salespeople —
not objective advisors — who recommend investments that will earn them
big commissions that come out of your investment dollars.
Additionally, if you overtrust an advisor, you may not research and monitor
your investments as carefully as you should. Figuring that Mr. Vice President
is an expert, some investors go along without ever questioning his advice or
watching what’s going on with their investments.

You should also question authority elsewhere in the investment business.
Too many investors blindly follow analysts’ stock recommendations without
considering the many conflicts of interest that such brokerage firm employ-
ees have. Brokerage analysts are often cheerleaders for buying various com-
panies’ stock because their firms are courting the business of new stock and
bond issuance of the same companies. And as the highly publicized account-
ing scandals at firms like Enron and WorldCom have highlighted, just because
a big-name accounting firm has blessed a company’s financial statements
doesn’t make the statements accurate or even close to accurate.
You can’t possibly evaluate the competence and agenda of someone you hire
until you yourself understand the lay of the land. You can’t possibly know for
sure that an analyst’s report or a professional service firm’s recommendation
or approval of a company is worth the paper it’s printed upon. Read good
publications on the topic to master the jargon and figure out how to evaluate
investments. Seek independent second opinions before you act on someone’s
recommendations. If you’re in the market for a broker, be sure to read
Chapter 9.
Getting Swept Up by Euphoria
Feeling strength and safety in numbers, some investors are lured into buying
hot stocks and sectors (for example, industries like technology, health care,
biotechnology, retail, and so on) after major price increases (see Chapter 5).
Psychologically, it’s reassuring to buy into something that’s going up and
gaining accolades. The obvious danger with this practice is buying into
investments selling at inflated prices that too soon deflate.
In the U.S. stock market by the late 1990s, investors were getting spoiled with
gains year after year in excess of the historic average annual return of 9 to 10
percent. Numerous surveys conducted during this period showed that many
investors expected to earn annual returns in the range of 15 to 20 percent
annually, nearly double the historic average. As always happens, though, fol-
lowing a period of excessively high returns such as those of the 1990s, returns
were below average in the subsequent period beginning in 2000 (and were
quite negative in the early 2000s).
Develop an overall allocation among various investments (especially diversi-

tion based upon what the latest hot sectors are. If anything, de-emphasize or
avoid stocks and sectors that are at the top of the performance charts. Think
back to the last time you went bargain shopping for a consumer item — you
looked for value, not high prices. See Chapter 5 to find out how to spot good
values in the financial markets and speculative bubbles to avoid.

Being Overconfident
As I discuss in Part V, newsletters, books, and even some financial periodicals
lead investors to believe that you can be the next Peter Lynch or Warren
Buffett if you follow a simple stock-picking system. The advent of the Internet
and online trading capabilities has spawned a whole new generation of short-
term (sometimes even same-day) traders.
In my work as a financial counselor, I came across plenty of people who lost a
lot of money after they had an early winner and had attributed that success
to their investing genius. These folks usually landed on my doorstep after
great and humbling losses woke them up.
If you have the speculative bug, earmark a small portion of your portfolio (no
more than 10 to 20 percent) for more aggressive investments. If overtrading
is a problem, seek out Gamblers Anonymous. (See Chapter 5 for more infor-
mation on questions to help you decide whether you or someone you know
has a gambling problem.)
Giving Up When Things Look Bleak
Inexperienced or nervous investors may be tempted to bail out when it
appears that an investment isn’t always profitable and enjoyable. Some
investors dump falling investments precisely at the times when they should
be doing the reverse — buying more. Whenever the U.S. stock market drops
more than a few percentage points in a short period, it attracts a lot of atten-
tion, which then leads to concern, anxiety, and in some cases, panic.
Investing always involves uncertainty. Many people forget this, especially during
good economic times like Americans enjoyed in the late 1990s. I find that
investors are more likely to feel more comfortable with riskier investments,
such as stocks, when they recognize that all investments carry uncertainty
and risk — just in different forms.
The U.S. stock market experienced a severe decline in the early 2000s — with
some growth stocks, especially technology stocks, plunging like stocks do in
a depression. Layoffs mounted, and the tragedy of September 11, 2001, under-
mined consumer confidence — the last prop holding the economy from a
recession. The United States also experienced major accounting scandals at
many companies, including large companies like Enron, WorldCom, and
Global Crossing.

I see many similarities between the early 2000s and the early 1970s, when
over several years a multitude of problems unfolded that could not have
been predicted. The early ’70s saw record trade and budget deficits, inflation
was rearing its ugly head, United States troops invaded Cambodia, college
students staged demonstrations against the Vietnam War, and four Kent State
University students were killed by National Guardsmen during an antiwar
protest. Other events included the Arab oil embargo and accompanying long
lines at gas stations and that period’s Arab-Israeli conflict — the Yom Kippur
War. U.S. Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned over exposure of his personal

Financial earthquakes and media coverage
I remember when a major earthquake struck the
San Francisco Bay Area, my home, in 1989. I had
just left an office building in San Francisco’s
financial district when the ground started to
shake, rattle, and roll. My first panicked thought
as I looked at all the glass-windowed skyscrap-
ers towering over me was that someone would
find me buried under piles of shattered glass.
Although unpleasant, the thought wasn’t origi-
nal. I had heard others explain this scenario.
Although the quake was scary, the only thing
that I lost that day was a bit of my courage —
and a little more of my hair, I’m sure!
Immediately following the earthquake, some of
my East Coast friends and family thought that
the entire Bay Area was in ruins, based on early
TV coverage. Television news programs typi-
cally played a few minutes’ worth of tape show-
ing a collapsed freeway near the city of
Oakland, several partially collapsed and fiery
buildings in the Marina district of San Francisco,
and a fallen portion of the upper deck of the Bay
Bridge. The media played these segments over
and over again.
Now I don’t want to diminish the tragedy, loss of
life, and damage that the earthquake caused.
However, watching these news programs
throughout the week following the quake, you’d
never have known that more than 99 percent of
the Bay Area was just fine, except for people
with shaken nerves and a few broken vases. Far
fewer people died as a result of this earthquake
than die every day from driving on U.S. road-
ways or from guns.
The media often report on stock market tremors
the same way they do earthquakes. When the
financial markets suffer earthshaking events,
some investors worry that their investments are
in a shambles. As I discuss in Part V, the media
are often to blame because they hype short-
term events and blow those events out of pro-
portion to captivate viewers and listeners.
History has shown that financial markets
recover; recovery is just a question of time. If
you invest for the long term, then the last six
weeks — or even the last couple years — is a
short period. Plus, a mountain of evidence and
studies demonstrate that no one can predict the
future, so you gain little from trying to base your
investment plans on predictions. In fact, you
can lose more money by trying to time the 
markets.
A big danger that larger-than-normal market
declines hold is that they may encourage deci-
sion making that’s based on emotion rather than
logic. Just ask anyone who sold after the stock
market collapsed in 1987 — the U.S. stock
market dropped 35 percent in a matter of weeks
in the fall of that year. Since then, even with the
significant declines in the early 2000s, the U.S.
market has risen more than sixfold!

income tax evasion and acceptance of bribes while in Maryland government.
Then news of Watergate broke, and President Richard Nixon’s impeachment
hearings began.
Following this string of events, and after flirting with the 1000 level since
1966, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged below 600 after Nixon
resigned in 1974. This severe stock market decline soured some investors on
the market for many years, which was truly unfortunate, as the U.S. stock,
even with the major decline in the early 2000s, has risen more than tenfold
since the mid-1970s.
The string of unfortunate events in the early 2000s soured some investors on
stock investing. History has repeatedly proven, however, that continuing to
buy stocks during down markets increases your long-term returns. The worst
thing that you can do in a slumping market is to throw in the towel.
Investors who are unable to withstand the volatility of riskier growth-oriented
investments, such as stocks, may be better off not investing in such vehicles
to begin with. Examining your returns over longer periods helps you keep the
proper perspective. If a short-term downdraft in your investments depresses
you, avoid tracking your investment values closely. Also, consider investing
in highly diversified, less-volatile funds that hold stocks worldwide as well as
bonds (see Chapter 8).
Investing Too Much to Quit
Although some investors realize that they can’t withstand losses and sell at
the first signs of trouble, other investors find that selling a losing investment
is so painful and unpleasant that they continue to hold a poorly performing
investment, despite the investment’s poor future prospects. Psychological
research backs this up — people find the pain of accepting a given loss twice
as intense as the pleasure of accepting a gain of equal magnitude.
Analyze your lagging investments to identify why they perform poorly. If a
given investment is down because similar ones are also in decline, hold on to
it. However, if something is inherently wrong with the investment — such as
high fees or poor management — make taking the loss more palatable by
remembering two things:
 If your investment is a non-retirement account investment, selling at a
loss helps reduce your income taxes.
 Consider the “opportunity cost” of continuing to keep your money in a
lousy investment — that is, what returns can you get in the future if you
switch to a “better” investment?
393
Chapter 20: Ten Investing Obstacles to Conquer

Overmonitoring Your Investments
The investment world seems so risky and fraught with pitfalls that some
people believe that closely watching an investment can help alert them to
impending danger. “The constant tracking is not unlike the attempt to relieve
anxiety by fingering worry beads. Yet paradoxically, it can increase emotional
distress because it requires a constant state of vigilance,” says psychologist
Dr. Paul Minsky.
In my work as a financial counselor, I see that investors who are the most
anxious about their investments and most likely to make impulsive trading
decisions are the ones who watch their holdings too closely, especially those
who monitor prices daily. The proliferation of Internet sites and stock market
cable television programs offering up-to-the-minute quotations gives these
investors even more temptation to overmonitor investments.
Restrict your “diet” of financial information and advice. Quality is far more
important than quantity. Watching the daily price gyrations of investments is
akin to eating too much junk food — doing so may satisfy your short-term
cravings but at the cost of your long-term health. If you invest in diversified
mutual funds, you really don’t need to examine your fund’s performance
more than once or twice per year. An ideal time to review your funds is when
you receive their annual or semiannual reports. Although many investors
track their funds daily or weekly, far fewer read their annual reports. Reading
these reports can help you keep a long-term perspective and gain some
understanding as to why your funds perform as they do and how they com-
pare to major market averages.
Being Unclear about Your Goals
Investing is more complicated than simply setting your financial goals (see
Chapter 3) and choosing solid investments to help you achieve them.
Awareness and understanding of the less tangible issues can maximize your
chances for investing success.
In addition to considering your goals in a traditional sense (when you want to
retire, how much of your kids’ college costs you want to pay) before you
invest, you should also consider what you want and don’t want to get from
the investment process. Do you treat investing as a hobby or simply as
another one of life’s tasks, such as maintaining your home? Do you enjoy the
intellectual challenge of picking your own stocks? Don’t just ponder these
questions on your own; discuss them with family members, too — after all,
you’re all going to have to live with your decisions and investment results.
394
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Ignoring Your Real Financial Problems
I know plenty of high-income earners, including more than a few who earn six
figures annually, who have little to invest. Some of these people have high-
interest debt outstanding on credit cards and auto loans yet spend endless
hours researching and tracking investments.
I also know many people who built significant personal wealth despite having
modest-paying jobs. The difference: the ability to live within your means.
If you don’t earn a high income, you may be tempted to think that you can’t
save. Even if you are a high-income earner, you may think that you can hit an
investment home run to accomplish your goals or that you can save more if
you can bump up your income. This way of thinking justifies spending most
of what you earn and saving little now. Investing is far more exciting than
examining your spending and making cutbacks. If you need help coming up
with more money to invest, see the latest edition of my book Personal Finance
For Dummies (published by Wiley).
Overemphasizing Certain Risks
Saving money is only half the battle. The other half is making your money
grow. Over long time periods, earning just a few percent more makes a big dif-
ference in the size of your nest egg. Earning inflation-beating returns is easy
to do if you’re willing to invest in stocks, real estate, and small businesses.
Figure 20-1 shows you how much more money you’ll have in 25 years if you
can earn investment returns that are greater than the rate of inflation (which
is currently running at about 3 percent).

Chapter 20: Ten Investing Obstacles to Conquer

As I discuss in Chapter 2, ownership investments (stocks, real estate, and
small business) have historically generated returns greater than the inflation
rate by 6 percent or more, while lending investments (savings accounts and
bonds) tend to generate returns of only 1 to 2 percent above inflation.
However, some investors keep too much of their money in lending invest-
ments out of fear of holding an investment that can fall greatly in value.
Although ownership investments can plunge in value, you need to keep in
mind that inflation and taxes eat away at your lending investment balances.
Believing in Gurus
Stock market declines, like earthquakes, bring all sorts of prognosticators,
soothsayers, and self-anointed gurus out of the woodwork, particularly among
those in the investment community who have something to sell, such as
newsletter writers. The words may vary, but the underlying message doesn’t:
“If you had been following my sage advice, you’d be much better off now.”
People spend far too much of their precious time and money in pursuit of a
guru who can tell them when and what to buy and sell. Peter Lynch, the
former manager of the Fidelity Magellan Fund, amassed one of the best long-
term stock market investing track records. His stock-picking ability allowed
him to beat the market averages by just a few percent per year. However,
even he says that you can’t time the markets, and he acknowledges knowing
many pundits who have correctly predicted the future course of the stock
market “once in a row”!
Clearly, in the world of investing, the most successful investors earn much
better returns than the worst ones. But what may surprise you is that you
can end up much closer to the top of the investing performance heap than
the bottom if you follow some relatively simple rules, such as regularly
saving and investing in low-cost growth investments. In fact, by doing so you
can beat many of the full-time investment professionals.

Ten Things to Consider When
Selling an Investment
In This Chapter
 Understanding your investment goals and other big-picture issues
 Selling for the right reasons
 Factoring taxes into your profit
You can and should hold good investments for years and decades. Each
year, people sell trillions of dollars’ worth of investments. My experience
helping people get a handle on their investments suggests that too many
people sell for the wrong reasons and hold on to investments that they
should sell. In this chapter, I highlight some issues to consider when you con-
template selling your investments.
Remembering Your Personal 
Preferences and Goals
If your life has changed since the last time you took a good look at your invest-
ment portfolio (or you’ve inherited investments), your current portfolio may no
longer make sense for you. I generally recommend that you review your hold-
ings once per year. Don’t make quick decisions about selling — take your time
and be sure that you understand tax and other ramifications before you sell.
The time that it takes you to manage your portfolio, for example, is a vital
matter if you’re starved for time or weary of managing time-consuming
investments. Leo, for example, loved to research, track, and trade individual

stocks — until his daughter was born. Then Leo realized how many hours his
hobby was taking away from his family, and that realization put his priorities
into perspective. Leo now invests in time-friendly mutual funds and doesn’t
follow them like a hawk.
One of my clients, Mary, loves investing in real estate because she enjoys the
challenge of researching, selecting, and managing her properties. She works
in a job where she has to put up with lots of controlling, stressed-out bosses.
For Mary, real estate isn’t just a profitable investment; it’s also a way of
expressing herself and growing personally.
Maintaining Balance in 
Your Overall Portfolio
A good reason to sell an investment is to allow you to better diversify your
portfolio. Suppose that before reading this book, you purchased a restaurant
stock every time you read about one. Now your portfolio resembles several
bad strip malls, and restaurant stocks comprise 80 percent of your holdings.
Or maybe, through your job, you’ve accumulated such a hefty chunk of 
stock in your employer that this stock now overwhelms the rest of your
investments.
It’s time for you to diversify. Sell off some of the holdings that you have too
much of and invest the proceeds in solid investments, such as those that I
recommend in this book. If you think that your employer’s stock is going to
be a superior investment, holding a big chunk is your gamble. At a minimum,
review Chapter 6 to see how to evaluate a particular stock. But remember to
consider the consequences if you’re wrong about your employer’s stock.
Conservative investors often keep too much of their money in bank accounts,
Treasury bills, and the like. Read Chapter 3 to come up with an overall invest-
ment strategy that fits with the rest of your personal financial situation.
Deciding Which Investments Are Keepers
Often, people are tempted to sell an investment for the wrong reasons. One
natural human tendency is to want to sell investments that have declined in
value. Some people fear a further fall, and they don’t want to be affiliated
398
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

with a loser, especially when money is involved. I think this reaction resem-
bles the phenomenon of piling into the lifeboats when a ship springs a leak.
Step back, take some deep breaths, and examine the merits of the investment
you’re considering selling. If an investment is otherwise still sound, why bail
out when prices are down and a sale is going on? What are you going to do
with the money? If anything, you should be contemplating buying more of
such an investment. Don’t make a decision to sell based on your current emo-
tional response, especially to recent news events. If bad news has recently
hit, it’s already old news. Don’t base your investment holdings on such transi-
tory events.
Use the criteria in this book for finding good investments to evaluate the wor-
thiness of your current holdings. If an investment is fundamentally sound,
don’t sell it.
A better reason to sell an investment is that it comes with high fees relative
to comparable investments. For example, if you own a bond mutual fund that
is socking it to you with fees of 1 percent per year, check out Chapter 8 to dis-
cover high-performing, lower-cost funds.
Tuning In to the Tax Consequences
When you sell investments that you hold outside a tax-sheltered retirement
account, such as an IRA or a 401(k), taxes should be one factor in your deci-
sion. (See Chapter 3 to find out about tax rates that apply to the sale of an
investment as well as to the distributions that investments make.) If the
investments are inside retirement accounts, taxes aren’t an issue because the
accounts are sheltered from taxation, unless you’re withdrawing funds from
the accounts.
Just because you pay tax on a profit from selling a non-retirement account
investment doesn’t mean that you should avoid selling. With real estate, you
can often avoid paying taxes on the profit that you make (see Chapters 10
and 11).
With stocks and mutual funds, things get more complex because you can spec-
ify which shares you want to sell. This option makes selling decisions more
complicated, but you may want to consider specifying what shares you’re sell-
ing because you may be able to save taxes. (Read the next section for more
information.) If you sell all your shares of a particular security that you own,
you need not concern yourself with specifying which shares you’re selling.
399
Chapter 21: Ten Things to Consider When Selling an Investment

Figuring Out Which Shares 
Cost You More
When you sell a portion of the shares of a security (for example, stock, bond,
or mutual fund) that you own, specifying which shares you’re selling may
benefit you taxwise. Here’s an example to show you why you may want to
specify selling certain shares — especially those shares that cost you more to
buy — so that you can save on your taxes.
Suppose that you own a total of 300 shares of a stock and you want to sell 
100 shares to pay for a root canal. Suppose further that you bought 100 of
these shares a long, long time ago at $10 per share, 100 shares two years ago
at $16 per share, and the last 100 shares one year ago at $14 per share. Today
the stock is at $20 per share. Although you didn’t get rich, you’re grateful that
you haven’t lost your shirt the way some of your stock-picking pals have.
The good tax folks at the IRS allow you to choose which shares you want to
sell. Electing to sell the 100 shares that you purchased at the highest price —
in other words, those that you bought for $16 per share two years ago — saves
you in taxes. (To comply with the tax laws, you must identify the shares that
you want the broker to sell by the original date of purchase and/or the cost
when you sell the shares. The brokerage firm through which you sell the
stock should include this information on the confirmation slip that you
receive for the sale.)
The other method of accounting for which shares are sold is the method that
the IRS forces you to use if you don’t specify before the sale which shares
you want to sell — the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. FIFO means that the first
shares that you sell are simply the first shares that you bought. Not surpris-
ingly, because most stocks appreciate over time, the FIFO method leads to
you paying more tax sooner. The FIFO accounting procedure leads to the con-
clusion that the 100 shares you sell are the 100 that you bought long, long
ago at $10 per share. Thus, you owe a larger amount of taxes than if you sold
the higher-cost shares under the specification method.
Although you save taxes today if you specify selling the shares that you
bought more recently at a higher price, remember that when you finally sell
the other shares, you’ll then owe taxes on the larger profit. The longer you
expect to hold these other shares, the greater the value you’ll likely derive
from postponing, realizing the larger gains and paying more in taxes. If you
expect your tax rate to decline in the future, you have another good reason to
hold off selling the shares in which you have greater profit.
When you sell shares in a mutual fund, the IRS has yet another accounting
method, known as the average cost method, for figuring your taxable profit or
400
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

loss when you sell a portion of your holdings in a mutual fund. This method
comes in handy if you bought shares in chunks over time or reinvested the
fund payouts into purchasing more shares of the fund. As the name suggests,
the average cost method allows you to take an average cost for all the shares
that you bought over time.
Selling Investments with Hefty Profits
Of course, no one likes to pay taxes, but if an investment you own has appre-
ciated in value, someday you’ll have to pay tax when you sell it, unless you
plan on passing the investment to your heirs upon your death. The IRS wipes
out the capital gains tax on appreciated assets at your death.
Capital gains tax applies when you sell an investment at a higher price than
you paid for it. As I explain in Chapter 3, your capital gains tax rate is differ-
ent from the tax rate that you pay on ordinary income (such as from employ-
ment earnings or interest on bank savings accounts).
Odds are, the longer you’ve held securities such as stocks, the greater the
capital gains you’ll have, because stocks tend to appreciate over time. If all
your assets have appreciated greatly, you may resist selling to avoid taxes.
However, if you need money for a major purchase, sell what you need and
pay the tax. Even if you have to pay state as well as federal taxes totaling
some 35 percent of the profit, you’ll have lots left. (For “longer-term” profits
from investments held more than one year, your federal and state capital
gains taxes would probably total less than 20 to 25 percent.) Before you sell,
however, do some rough figuring to make sure that you’ll have enough money
left to accomplish what you want. If you seek to sell one investment and rein-
vest in another, you’ll owe tax on the profit unless you’re selling and rebuying
real estate (see Chapters 10 and 11).
If you hold a number of assets, in order to diversify and meet your other
financial goals, give preference to selling your largest holdings with the small-
est capital gains. If you have some securities that have profits and some with
losses, you can sell some of each in order to offset the profits with the losses.
Cutting Your (Securities) Losses
Perhaps you own some turkeys in your portfolio. If you need to raise cash for
some particular reason, you may consider selling some securities at a loss.
You can use losses to offset gains as long as you hold both offsetting securi-
ties for more than one year (long term) or you hold both for no more than
401
Chapter 21: Ten Things to Consider When Selling an Investment

one year (short term). The IRS makes this delineation because the IRS taxes
long-term gains and losses on a different rate schedule than short-term gains
and losses (see Chapter 3).
If you need to sell securities at a loss, be advised that you cannot claim more
than $3,000 in net losses in any one year. If you sell securities with net losses
totaling more than $3,000 in a year, you must carry the losses over to future
tax years. This situation not only creates more tax paperwork but also delays
realizing the value of deducting a tax loss. So try not to have net losses
(losses + gains) that exceed $3,000 in a year.
Some tax advisors advocate doing year-end tax-loss selling with stocks, bonds,
and mutual funds. The logic goes that if you hold a security at a loss, you
should sell it, take the tax write-off, and then buy it (or something similar) back.
When selling investments for tax-loss purposes, be careful of the so-called
wash sale rules. The IRS doesn’t allow the deduction of a loss for a security
sale if you buy that same security back within 30 days. As long as you wait 31
or more days, no problem. If you’re selling a mutual fund, you can purchase a
fund similar to the one you’re selling to easily sidestep this rule.
If you own a security that has ceased trading and appears worthless (or
you’ve made a loan that hasn’t been repaid), you can likely deduct this loss.
Peruse the latest edition of Taxes For Dummies (published by Wiley) for more
information on what situations are deductible and how to claim these losses
on your annual tax return.
Selling an Investment with 
an Unknown Cost
You may not know what some investments originally cost you or the person
who bought them and later gave them to you. If you can’t find that original
statement, start by calling the firm where the investment was bought. Whether
it’s a brokerage firm or mutual fund company, the company should be able to
send you copies of old account statements, although you may have to pay a
small fee for this service.
Also, increasing numbers of investment firms, especially mutual fund compa-
nies, can tell you upon the sale of an investment what its original cost was.
The cost generally calculated is the average cost for the shares that you pur-
chased. See Taxes For Dummies for more ideas of what to do when original
records aren’t available for other assets, such as real estate.
402
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Recognizing That All Brokers 
Are Not Created Equal
If you’re selling securities such as stocks and bonds, you need to know that
some brokers charge more — in some cases, lots more — to sell. Even if the
securities that you want to sell currently reside at a high-cost brokerage firm,
you can transfer them to a discount brokerage firm. See Chapter 9 to read
about the virtues of using a discount brokerage firm.
Finding a Trustworthy Financial Advisor
You aren’t stupid. Before you picked up this book, you may have considered
yourself an investing dummy. I didn’t, and I still don’t, but hopefully you feel
less like a dummy after reading this book. If you delegate your investment
decision making to an advisor, you’re likely to be disappointed.
Few financial advisors offer objective and knowledgeable advice. Unfortunately,
if you’re grappling with a selling decision, finding a competent and impartial
financial advisor to help with the decision is about as difficult as finding a
politician who doesn’t accept special-interest money. Most financial consul-
tants work on commission, which can cloud their judgment. And among the
minority of fee-based advisors, almost all manage money, which creates other
conflicts of interest. The more money you give them to invest and manage,
the more money these advisors make. If you need advice about whether to
sell some investments, turn to a tax or financial advisor who works on an
hourly basis.

Ten Tips for Investing 
in a Down Market
In This Chapter
 Keeping a level head amidst the doom and gloom
 Identifying and fixing flaws in your portfolio
 Understanding why value stocks have less downside risk
U
nless there’s a lot of other breaking news, sharp drops in the stock
market make headlines — stock market gyrations are great media
fodder. Every day the market environment is different, and new stocks are
plunging and rising. And now, with more individuals holding stocks through
company and personal retirement plans, the media has a captive, concerned
audience. In this chapter, I discuss how to maximize your chances for invest-
ing success when stocks take a turn for the worse.
Don’t Panic
No one enjoys turning on his car radio, clicking his television set on, or log-
ging on to the Internet and getting this news: “Stocks plunge. The Dow Jones
Industrial plummeted 400 points today.” Don’t panic — it’s just one day’s
events.
Just because a home burned to the ground recently in your town and the
news is being broadcast over all the local media, you probably wouldn’t start
living on the street. But you might take some sensible precautions, such as
installing smoke alarms and repairing any malfunctioning appliances that
might cause a fire, to ensure that your home isn’t likely to become the next
fire department statistic. Likewise, don’t shun stocks just because of the
down periods. As I discuss in Chapter 2, risk and return go hand in hand. If
you want wealth-building investments that provide superior long-term returns,
you must be willing to accept risk (that is, volatility and down periods).

Do you see the media reporting on stories with headlines such as “Luxury
home prices plunged $40,000 today in Marina Del Rey”? I didn’t think so!
Although other wealth-building investments, such as real estate and small
business, go through significant declines, you generally see few headlines on
their daily price movements. A good reason for this is that no one reports on
the pricing of real estate and small businesses minute by minute every busi-
ness day, as is done with stock prices.
Keep Your Portfolio’s Perspective in Mind
If you follow my advice, your portfolio will consist of diversified stock hold-
ings, including some international stocks, and preferably through mutual
funds, along with some bonds. One of my counseling clients called me when
the stock market was dropping precipitously during the summer of 2002. “I
just saw that the S&P 500 is now down 28 percent so far this year and the
NASDAQ is down 34 percent. Should I sell?”
He was quite surprised when I crunched some numbers and determined that
his portfolio of stocks and bonds was down just 8 percent for the year. Now,
mind you, I wasn’t trying to minimize or trivialize the fact that he had lost
money so far that year. However, he overlooked the fact that the bonds in his
portfolio had actually increased in value, as had some of his stock funds that
were invested in value-oriented stocks. Please see Chapter 8 for tips on how
to build a diversified mutual fund portfolio.
View Major Declines as 
Unadvertised Sales
Unlike retail stores, which experience bigger-than-normal crowds when
prices are reduced, fewer investors, especially individual investors, desire to
buy stocks after they’ve suffered a sharp decline. When stock prices decline,
don’t get swept up in the pessimism. View declines as the financial markets
having a sale on stocks. Stocks usually bottom when pessimism reaches a
peak. The reason: Those who were motivated to sell have done so, and the
major selling has exhausted itself.
Now, I’m not saying you should randomly buy just any stock after a decline.
For example, as I discuss in Part II, I’m not an advocate of buying individual
stocks, especially in a specific industry (such as technology or auto manufac-
turing). When technology stocks started declining in 2000, some investors made
406
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

the mistake of buying more of them after prices dropped 10 or 20 percent.
What such “buy on the dip” investors didn’t realize was that the technology
stocks that they were buying were still grossly overpriced when measured by
price/earnings ratios and other valuation measures (see Chapter 5).
You’re best off buying stocks gradually over time through well-managed,
diversified mutual funds. When the broad stock market suffers a substantial
decline and stocks are at reduced prices — on sale — you can step up your
buying.
Identify the Real Problems 
with Your Portfolio
Stock market declines can be effective at quickly exposing problems with
your portfolio. For example, when technology stocks tumbled in 2000 and
2001, I started getting lots of e-mails and letters from investors who had
loaded up on technology stocks and wondered what I thought they should do
with their technology holdings. Most of these investors kept thinking about
how much more their technology stocks were worth at their peak before the
decline set in.
I urged such investors to acknowledge the huge risk they were clearly taking
by putting so many eggs in one basket. I also highlighted the dangers of chas-
ing after a hot sector, and I pointed out that today’s hot sector often becomes
tomorrow’s laggard.
In addition to poorly diversified portfolios, a declining stock market can also
expose the high fees you may be paying on your investments. Fewer investors
care about getting whacked with fees amounting to, say, 2 percent annually
when they’re making 20 percent year after year. But after a few years of low
or negative returns, such high fees become quite painful and more obvious.
Avoid Growth Stocks If 
You Get Queasy Easily
In a sustained stock market slide (bear market), the stocks that get clobbered
the most tend to be the ones that were most overpriced from the period of
the previous market rise (bull market). Like fads such as hula hoops, pet
407
Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Investing in a Down Market

rocks, and Cabbage Patch dolls, in each bull market, particular types of
growth stocks, such as Internet companies or biotechnology companies, can
be especially hot.
Predicting the duration and magnitude of a bear market is nearly impossible.
Consequently, wouldn’t it make sense to focus your stock investing on those
stocks that produce solid long-term returns and that tend to decline less in a
major market decline? So-called value stocks tend to be among the safer types
of stocks to hold during a bear market. Value stocks generally have less down-
side risk because they generally pay higher dividends and have relatively
greater underlying asset values in comparison to their stock valuations.
As has happened in some past bear markets, numerous value-oriented stocks
actually appreciated during the bear market in the early 2000s. Please see
Chapter 8 for my discussion of the different types of stocks and mutual funds
that practice value stock investing.
Tune Out Negative, Hyped Media
When the stock market is crumbling, subjecting yourself to a daily diet of bad
news and conflicting opinions about what to do next makes most investors
do the wrong things. When major stock markets were really getting clobbered
during the summer of 2002, a person in my hometown said to me, “Eric, it
seems that the civilized world as we know it is coming to an end. We have all
this tension and conflict in the Middle East, we’re at war in Afghanistan, the
news media are talking about our going after Iraq next, no one can believe
company financial statements, and stocks are too risky to hold. All I keep
hearing is bad news when I turn on my television or go online. Shouldn’t I just
sell my stocks and buy something else?”
I told this person that he should stop watching and focusing upon bad news.
Just like a steady diet of junk food is bad for your physical health, a continu-
ous stream of negative, hyped news is bad for your financial health. In my
observations, dwelling on bad news doesn’t do such great things for people’s
emotional health, either.
Conflict is always occurring somewhere in the world. The business world will
always have unethical and corrupt company executives. Holding stocks
always carries risk. That’s why those who see the glass as half full and who
see the positive and not just the negative build wealth by holding stocks, real
estate, and small business over the long term.
408
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Ignore Large Point Declines — 
Consider the Percentages
It drives me crazy when the news media show a one-day chart of a major
stock market index, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, on a day when
the index drops a large number of points. In recent years, 200- and 300-point
drops in the Dow happened fairly frequently.
Look at the percentage decline in an index rather than at a point decline.
Although 200 to 300 points sounds like a horrendous drop, when the Dow
was around 10,000, that drop amounted to a move of 2 to 3 percent. No one
likes losing that portion of their wealth invested in stocks in one day, but the
percentage of change sounds less horrifying than the point change.
Don’t Believe That You Need a Rich Dad
to Be a Successful Investor
A young man wrote to me about an interview that he had read about the Rich
Dad, Poor Dad series, by author Robert Kiyosaki. In the interview, Kiyosaki
said that the rich are different from the rest of us because “They teach their
children how to be rich. . . . These get-rich techniques include investing with
leverage . . . and staying away from mutual funds and 401(k)s, which are way
too risky.”
The young man came from a humble background and had been salting money
away in mutual funds through his company retirement plan. But he thought
that he might be doomed to a lifetime of poverty after reading what the Rich
Dad guru had to say. Here’s what I told him.
I’ve known plenty of people over the years who came from nonwealthy fami-
lies who built substantial wealth by living within their means and by invest-
ing in the three wealth-building assets that I focus upon in this book: stocks,
real estate, and small business.
With regard to mutual funds and 401(k)s, in addition to his saying that they
are way too risky, Kiyosaki also says, “Those vehicles are only good for about
20 percent of the population, people making $100,000 or more.” I couldn’t dis-
agree more. In fact, my experience is that mutual funds are tailor-made for
nonwealthy people who don’t have the assets to properly create a diversified
portfolio themselves.
409
Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Investing in a Down Market

Kiyosaki also says that he doesn’t like mutual funds because “Mutual funds
have got no insurance from a stock market crash. To me, that’s sad, and I am
concerned.” As I discuss in Parts I and II of this book, the best way to reduce
the risk of investing in stocks is to diversify your holdings not only in a vari-
ety of stocks but also in other investments that don’t move in tandem with
the stock market.
Kiyosaki claims that he invests with the benefit of insurance when investing
in real estate. He says, “My banker requires me to have insurance from cata-
strophic losses.” This is a nonsensical comparison because such an insur-
ance policy would cover losses from say, a fire, but not a decline in market
value of the real estate due to overall market conditions.
(Re-)Read Chapters 4 and 5
When the going gets tough in the stock market, you can easily lose perspective.
Even if you’ve already read them before, please go back and read Chapters 4
and 5 again. These chapters explain how the stock market works and what
influences stock prices in the short term versus the longer term. Be sure that
you have the long-term perspective that you need to succeed with stock invest-
ing and that you really understand how the financial markets work.
Talk to People Who Care about You
Life’s challenging events can be humbling and sometimes depressing. Holding
an investment that’s dropped a lot in value — whether it’s a stock, mutual
fund, real estate, or small business — is one such event.
But you don’t have to carry the burden yourself. Talk about your feelings
with someone who understands and cares about you. Be clear about and
communicate what you’re seeking — empathy, good listening, a sounding
board, or advice.
