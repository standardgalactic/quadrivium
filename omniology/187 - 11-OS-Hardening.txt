Enable SELinux 
Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture integrated into the 2.6.x kernel 
using the Linux Security Modules (LSM). It is a project of the United States National Security 
Agency (NSA) and the SELinux community. SELinux integration into Red Hat Enterprise Linux 
was a joint effort between the NSA and Red Hat. 
 

SELinux defines the access and transition rights of every user, application, process, and file on 
the system 
 
/etc/sysconfig/selinux 
enforcing — The SELinux security policy is enforced. 
permissive — The SELinux system prints warnings but does not enforce policy. 
This is useful for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.  
disabled — SELinux is fully disabled. SELinux hooks are disengaged from the kernel and the 
pseudo-file system is unregistered. 
 
Commands = sestatus 
Find status of a file = stat filename 
Other commands = chcon, checkpolicy, newrole, getsebool, setsebool, fixfiles, semanage
